watercooling,3e3ypj,xxdofxx,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:04:04 2015 UTC,looks like a 27mm thick rad. any examples where custom loops using just a single rad like that cool both a cpu and gpu decently? would be a definite buy for me if that rad was just thicker for some version
watercooling,3e3ypj,computeBuild,1 point,Wed Jul 22 05:09:35 2015 UTC,I'm more curious as to installing it on the cpu and gpu.  Is there a quick disconnect for one or the other? Just would be odd to have to mount the rad gpu then cup or vise versa in the case or maybe not?
watercooling,3e3fhf,orksatme,5,Tue Jul 21 17:36:33 2015 UTC,"If your CPU is still running the same temp then there's a problem with your GPU block.   An air bubble is stuck in there (try tilting the case in kinds of directions as much as you can.) Depending on the type of coolant and coolant treatments you could have algae, bacteria, etc. building up in the block. Depending on the tubing type there could be plasticizer build up stuck in the GPU block. Mixed metals in the loop will cause corrosion as well. Aluminum combined with copper for example. Thermal paste/thermal pads on the GPU block could also be an issue.   I'd try tilting the case a bunch to free up an air bubbles and if that didn't work you're going to have to drain the loop and take the block off to inspect.  For future reference it's always good to take some type of system benchmark anytime you make changes to a system. So like pre-water cooling benchmarks, post water cooling benchmarks, new video card installed, pre/post overclocking, etc. Make sure you use some kind of industry standard benchmark. Record temperatures along with the benchmark scores (including ambient temperature at the time they were run) then if you suspect a problem you can come back and have a standard to measure against. The standard of ""a few minutes of gaming"" isn't really a standard at all. Benchmarks are not just for e-peen measuring."
watercooling,3e3fhf,Thergood,2,Tue Jul 21 22:26:43 2015 UTC,"Thanks for a very detailed answer :)    Tilting the case was the first thing I tried, but I will try it again a bit later. I really hope it could work.  I used distilled water and some biocide as coolant, but I guess algae could grow anywayds. That's kind of gross, actually. :( If that's the case, how do I deal with it? My tubing is made out of 'PVC'. I don't know if that's any good? I'm pretty sure that the water is only running trough copper, but I would be wrong.    I guess I'll have to drain the loop and inspect futher. If there's something growing in there, it would be best to fix it asap, I guess."

watercooling,3e3fhf,The_Original_One,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:14:16 2015 UTC,"380mm is plenty of space to dispose of that heat. If your pump and coolant seem normal then you're just not dumping your waste heat like you used to. I assume you're in a building with AC so you're probably maintaining a fairly steady ambient temperature from two months ago, so the only thing I can think of is that your fans aren't being as efficient as usual.   Have you updated your fan curves? Motherboard firmware update maybe? Do you have power to all your fans? Has one of them died?"

watercooling,3e3fhf,Shizles,2,Tue Jul 21 19:30:09 2015 UTC,Could be some air trapped somewhere in the loop
watercooling,3e3fhf,lol_alex,2,Tue Jul 21 19:38:52 2015 UTC,"could just be dust built up on the rad, dont think of your loop as a global temp the temps will change all around the loop. for example my cpu jumps depending on weather, dust, humidity it can change about 10 Degrees my gpu does the same sometimes its at 45 sometimes it can go to 55 don't think so much about it 64 degrees really isn't a huge issue and going to cause any problems, But yeah maybe some air has collected in the gpu block?"
watercooling,3e3fhf,Vuman619,3,Tue Jul 21 19:45:37 2015 UTC,"With the usual flow rates the temperature of the water will be the same everywhere in the loop after some time.  If your GPU is getting hotter than before, but not the CPU, it is an issue with the full cover block of the GPU. If a rad was dusty or clogged all temperatures should go up not just GPU.   Micro channels clogged up if you have those? I used food coloring once, really learned to use a fine toothbrush afterwards... Air bubble trapped in the GPU block? Gently rock your case from side to side, that should do it. Easier to see if you have a Plexi cover of course. Thermal compound problem, or at least thermal energy transfer to the block not good anymore? Take it off and check. GPU could be failing although I don't think that's likely unless you are seeing glitches, freezes or dropouts."

Even with multiple things you should be ok with one pump, they're powerful enough. You buy a water block for the components and some fittings with either soft or hard tubing to go with it.

watercooling,3e460z,mpickering321,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:35:21 2015 UTC,"1) Water cooling a GPU is usually very simple, the block should come with detailed instructions that you MUST read. 2) As long as you have a good pump you should have no problems keeping pressure though out the loop. 3) All you need 1 pump per loop in the system. 4) I'm not entirely sure what you mean by ""separate"" but I assume you are asking how you connect all the components. That is done using your choice of tubing and fittings.     There is a YouTuber by the name of JayzTwoCents.

watercooling,3e3ri2,audioxbliss,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:52:52 2015 UTC,I have a M8 I bought back in 2012. What do you want to know?
watercooling,3e3ri2,audioxbliss,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:58:30 2015 UTC,"How easy was it to build in? If you watercooled your computer, what kind of radiator space do you have?  Biggest question, was it worth the money spent on it? It's not exactly a cheap case to buy, it's more expensive than most CPU's and a pretty big chunk of GPU's"
watercooling,3e3ri2,audioxbliss,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:49:46 2015 UTC,"First of all, sorry for the delay.  I was about to leave work and decided to just ask for specifics on what you need to know, so I could hopefully target the response a bit better.   By far the easiest case I've ever used. Partly due to the cavernous space that allows for easy access to basically everything, but also due to the flexibility and modularity of the design.  Also, the PSU position for the double-wides makes cable routing a non-issue.  So easy. I have two EX360s sitting in the upper chamber.  The 80mm(?) extended top I got for my case perfectly allows for an EX360 and two fans in the top section.  I could theoretically fit four more 360mm rads (2 front, 2 side) if I bought the adapters/mounts for them.  I might be able to fit two more to the bottom fan mounts, but I'd have to find a radiator with somewhat precise measurements.  I could then fit two more 360mm rads if I bought a pedestal.  In addition to all this, the case has four tube routing holes on the back, theoretically allowing me to mount rads on the back.  Of course, I could also mount a variety of 120mm and 240mm rads in the aforementioned locations. It was worth it for me.  The case is extremely well built; the quality is obvious from the moment you take it out of the box.  That plus the sheer flexibility of the CaseLabs system is what makes me feel like I'll never buy a case again.  If I do, it'll probably just be a bigger CaseLabs monstrosity.  My case also has a fairly conservative design, when you get past the size, which helps with its longevity.   Most of what I've said is the good stuff, so I'll touch on the bad stuff real quick:   Cost.  Like you've noticed, the cases are expensive as hell.  Not only that, but the extra parts you'll want to buy start to add up pretty damn fast.  Checking my purchase history, I paid $490.85 for the case initially.  I then proceeded to purchase $298.50 worth of extra parts and such.  Basically, I could've built another decent computer with the money I've spent on my case alone. I know there have been some design changes that have alleviated this issue, but I seem to have weird issues with resonance.  Every once in a while, the vibrations seem to sync up and cause the various panels to touch in unexpected ways, which results in a disconcerting rattle.  I'm not sure if it's just due to my particular setup, but it's annoying nonetheless. With so much space for stuff, you will always want to add more.  I now have a grand total of 29 fans in my computer.  And I keep coming back to the idea of adding a second PSU, even though my 1200W is overkill. Stupid CaseLabs..."

watercooling,3e484q,br0fessi0nal,2,Tue Jul 21 20:52:20 2015 UTC,"i'd go for the photon.  Bay res tend to transfer noise to the chassis, plus i think a tube res just looks nicer.  The luxe should have good mounting points for tube reservoirs."
watercooling,3e484q,erickliban,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:36:54 2015 UTC,"Cool, whats the easiest way to fill the tube once its mounted? Just carefully inside the case with a funnel?"
watercooling,3e484q,nono0044,2,Tue Jul 21 22:08:47 2015 UTC,"Be careful with that res.  With the inner tube in the photon, it makes air hard to escape while you're filling it.    That being said, you can use a funnel, use an extra fitting and some tubing, or a squirt bottle with a hooked tube.  Just work slowly and pour slow to make sure the water isn't overflowing out due to the trapped air."
watercooling,3e484q,nakdawg,2,Tue Jul 21 22:25:42 2015 UTC,"Im running two photon 270s and the trick to filling them is to just tilt it on a slight angle, even 10degrees will do. With that slight angle im able to pour at max rate without spillage from the top via a funnel.  Its hard to describe without a drawing, but the hole at the top isnt a straight hole into the tube, theres a circular plate sitting on top of the white acrylic tube inside, so the first thing the water hits is the plate and then spills over the sides and into the tube. If too much water hits the plate at the same time and seals off the gaps on the side for the water to flow in thus preventing air from escaping causing it to overflow out the top. If you have it on an angle, water will slide off the bottom of the plate faster than it can rise to the top of the plate, so you'll never have that issue.  In my experience with the photons compared to other reservoirs, is that the build quality is pretty amazing. Full glass and aluminium construction. You can tell that its good stuff from the moment you pick it up, the thing weighs a tonne compared to other reservoirs. Once you put it in, i guess its no different to other reservoirs, but at least you can rest assured knowing that your glass wont ever cloud up or crack as easily as a acrylic res would.  The reservoir comes with 4 ports, one large fill port at the top, one exhaust and two intakes, i have both of mine combined with a D5 pump. My case can be opened from the top, so when i need to fill it, i just take the top off for easy access to my res. The second unused intake port i use as a drain port. ive just attached a male-male extender to a valve and placed a stop cap on it, when i need to drain it i undo the cap and thread in a G1/4fitting with tube attached and release the valve."

watercooling,3e484q,nakdawg,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:17:41 2015 UTC,"I mean, don't worry about the threads unless you're constantly screwing and unscrewing fittings into them.  Unless you start encountering leaks, it should be something that won't effect you.  As for draining/filling for maintenance, if you set up a good drain system then it should be a relatively quick task.

I was browsing other builds that used the H440 and came across Gatsby and I love the way it looks but I would rather use flex tubing and clear coolant I found the res I want to use but I have no idea what kind of radiator, pump, or fittings (white or black I haven't decided yet) I should get.  Is there room the case for SLI cards assuming I put the res in a similar position to where it is Gatsby? I don't think so but hopefully I'm wrong."

You could even try plugging the pump pwm cable into another computer of that is an option   Don't lose patience and run the whole computer to get the pwm signal, it'll probably just crash from temp spikes."

watercooling,3e1p5z,TheWatchmaker74,2,Tue Jul 21 14:25:08 2015 UTC,"This was a few months ago, but I just plugged the oc panel into the PSU as per normal, then plugged the pump pwm cable into the first fan header on the panel under the cover, you'll need to have the oc panel loose, ie not fixed into the drive bay, just slide the cover to expose the circuit and fan headers and then plug the pwm cable from the pump in:) The pump will go full speed immediately so get ready to pull the cable when you need to top up the reservoir. Don't let the pump run dry!!!  It was such a huge relief when the water started moving fast and the loop started to fill up properly."

I even have a molex plug to 2-pin (in a 4 pin female plug) which are black and red. I bridged the PSU 24pin to turn it on by itself. This is common stuff.  How did this take two posts to solve?
watercooling,3e0qm5,battlerobot,8,Tue Jul 21 01:49:53 2015 UTC,"The fitting normally becomes watertight long before it becomes finger tight, so you generally have at least 180-270degrees of rotation after it becomes watertight but before you break something, to get it facing the direction you want.  That said, just get a rotating fitting for peace of mind."

watercooling,3dydkx,Falb0ner,2,Tue Jul 21 12:28:10 2015 UTC,"In a way I guess mine is inspired by Jay's. Around the time he was doing Red Mist I was planning on getting a 900D and fabricating a midplate for it as well as cutting out the front 5.25"" bays to make room for the double res setup then I saw his overview of the SMA8 and the Skunkworks logs and decided this was a better investment of time and money than the 900D.  The fans are giving very good static pressure. These days I mostly recommend EK Vardars (especially with the 140s coming out soon), but these Alpenfohns give the same performance as Noctuas they're just harder to find."

(I'm planning on doing a watercooled build but i've never done any, i'd really like to go directly for hard tubing has it looks way nicer imo)   Also, why 2 reservoirs? Because of the size of the rads and the dual GPU ? (I don't know much about watercooling but i'm doing my studies :) )"
watercooling,3dydkx,Pnmorris513,3,Mon Jul 20 20:28:03 2015 UTC,"Thank you! :) This is my fourth time water cooling (same computer each time, I just like to change stuff ever so often). Measuring, patience, and double checking your measurements helps a lot with rigid tubing. I think rigid is easier to work  with than soft tubing, compression fittings for soft tubing always make my hands really hurt. There is still some soft tubing in my build, it's just all in the lower chamber of the case where it can't be seen. I highly recommend the Monsoon bending kit, It's what I'm using here.  There are 2 reservoirs because there's actually 2 loops (both of the pumps are in the lower chamber of the case). It's not as easy to see since all the tubing isn't there yet, but I'm splitting the GPUs to be their own loop with the bottom radiator while the CPU loop will use the top radiator.  Hope this helps, and good luck with your first water cooled build!"

O-rings stayed in place which was nice.  I wasnt able to scrub past that remaining discoloration in the copper.  Is that corrosion or still biological?  Anything I can do about it?  Edit:  pretty sure its just corrosion.  Looks like an old penny.  Look at that splotch on the chipset block that's still super shiny though!  That's where my hot ass GTX 470 has been pumping its heat for years and you can see in the first image there was a rather large mass of flora there.  I imagine the heat was nice and comfy and that is the also only spot with a large growth was attached directly to the copper block surface.  That layer of flora seems to have protected the copper under it from the corrosion! That and the heat maybe.  The other growths were mostly against the acrylic and only touching the copper at the tips of the pins.  There are a few slightly shinier pin tips too.  Fascinating.

Very Generic fittings. EKWB complete kits are more expensive.  Your budget is a bit low. Why not go the all in one AIO route? Less hassle.  Truth is. If u go custom water loop. Your budget are simply priced out of a custom water loop. And the performance of a AIO can easily compare to a custom.

Each person has different priorities for what they want to achieve through watercooling (i.e noise, temps, overclocking headroom, etc).  So maybe explore what watercooling does, how it functions and come back with more focused questions."
watercooling,3e0df0,nono0044,2,Tue Jul 21 00:42:38 2015 UTC,"You might also want to have a think about how much you're willing to spend. Have a look on performance-pcs.com and throw together a rough cart for a cpu waterblock, gpu waterblock, radiator of at least 240mm, reservoir, pump, tubing, coolant, at least 8-10 compression fittings and check your total cart value.  Too many times ive explained the costs to curious people and have them wide eyed in shock at how much money goes into custom loop cooling. The cheapest of builds will go for around 300, i normally advise people to put aside 500, hardline tubing upwards of 1000 or more.  When it comes to putting water around your expensive electronic components, you dont want to half arse it."
watercooling,3e0df0,nakdawg,2,Tue Jul 21 00:48:27 2015 UTC,"While I agree with the fact that costs are something to seriously consider.

Unfortunately for me, im based in Australia and you'll find very few watercooled rigs here, let alone second hand parts.  I usually bring up the cost factor for those who post about watercooling before having done any kind of research. Those who are more like, ""hey, watercooling looks cool, those big colored tubes are neat, what do i need to buy"" generally are the ones who get the nasty shock when they see prices expecting to pay similar prices to a CLC or aircooler.

watercooling,3e0df0,crashbash2020,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:44:26 2015 UTC,"AUD sorry. The extra costs are usually because of the extra things you need to buy to make a hard line build like silicon inserts, bending kits,  saws or dremels, heat guns, gloves, sand paper and then if you decide on having a fitting at every bend instead of bending the tubes yourself that can easily be a few more hundred dollars worth of fittings.    Here's an example of the fittings I used for my single cpu loop. I've got a double loop in my system, so multiply this by two and that's about $500AUD on fittings alone.    http://imgur.com/FX2a8EH    Granted, if you've got all the tools already and are going for a bend only build, it's only a little more expensive than soft tubing, just a lot harder."
watercooling,3e0df0,nakdawg,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:41:19 2015 UTC,"Oh ok yeah I didn't even spend close to 500NZD excluding blocks and rads.

watercooling,3dwp3o,BlayneTX,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:44:52 2015 UTC,"Nice, yeah I always find something like that happens after everything is measured, bent, filled, and running. In my rig I was going for only 90 degree bends and then realized there was a connection where that just wouldn't work (card -> bottom radiator, I'm in an Enthoo Primo).  I had to settle for two 30 degree bends and it was a little annoying as it threw off the otherwise horizontal/vertical lines in my case.  Just please don't go overboard with the LEDs if you can. The muted look of the matte black case accented by the red and silver is really awesome and not too over-the-top. The problem I've found with LEDs in my case is they are almost always too harsh - I'm thinking about switching to the RGB Corsair Link stuff but I'm still researching how usable that is on Linux. Either way, I know that Corsair Link lets you set custom colors (that can change dependent on things like GPU temp) and that by itself is enough to step away from the standard red, blue, green, or white LEDs that I've found to be way too harsh.   I have to say this again though: great work. I'm not usually the biggest fan of the red/black or the 900 but that is one fantastic looking build."

watercooling,3dyhpy,Jeffweg16,6,Mon Jul 20 15:53:21 2015 UTC,I think you should do some more personal research into the matter first as you don't really seem to know what you need or really want to accomplish.
watercooling,3dyhpy,nono0044,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:38:43 2015 UTC,"This. Asking us to spoonfeed you a build is not going to go well for you. Having an understanding of what everything does is very important. Look at the sidebar, good resources there.  Also imho the source 810 might not serve you well for watercooling"
watercooling,3dyhpy,Elements95,2,Mon Jul 20 18:56:56 2015 UTC,"A watercooling ""loop"" consists of a few items connected together forming a loop in which the water travels. Basically, waterblocks take the heat from your CPU/GPU, cold water enters the waterblock takes the heat travels out and into a radiator where the water is cooled and travels back to the waterblock. So the essential components are:     reservoir - You wiill pour your water in here, it holds excess water so that your pump is always primed and never running dry. It makes bleeding your loop alot easier by eliminating airbubbles from your loop     pump - pumps your water around the loop     waterblock(s) - consists of GPU waterblocks and CPU waterclocks, it takes the heat, cold water enters, hot water exits.     radiator(s) - that hot water will then go into a radiator, fans will cool the radiator and water, and that cold water will go back into the reservoir thus finishing your loop     tubing - connects all your parts together     fittings - for soft tubing, a compression fittiing is required for every entry point and every exit point of each component. A compression fitting has a barb that you attach your tubing to, and a compression ring that holds that tubing in place. This is what can potentially blow your budget, as there are alot of fancy fiittings like 45degree bends, 90degree bends, snake bends, quick disconnects, T-ways, Y-splitters etc depending on how fancy you want to get. But the mininum you need is a basic compression fitting     Hope that didnt confuse you too much. Best thing to do is learn to identify each of these components, then go onto youtube and look up watercooling tutorials and watch and identify each part i mentioned in the build.     So, onto the costs. This is where alot of people looking into watercooling get turned off from it, its not cheap unfortunately. Be prepared to put aside at least $500 for a full CPU+GPU loop if you're going with soft tubing and upwards of $1000 or more if you're going with hardline acrylic with alot of fittings and bends. I've got two seperate loops for my CPU and GPU, 2 reservoirs, 2 pumps, 600mm worth of radiators, 7 fans, hardline acrylic, 90degree fittings for every bend, valves for drain ports and so far my watercooling and modding bill has grown close to $1500AUD and growing. This hobby sees some people spending more on cooling than most would spend on their entire PCs, we do it as a hobby, because its fun, because it looks cool, don't expect amazing performance per dollar when it comes to this hobby.     I feel that the best brands for you to get started with are Bitspower for their huge range of fittings, and EKWB waterblocks are generally the go to for good GPU/CPU waterblocks. Compression fittings are roughly $4-5 each, fancier bends can go up to $15-30 each, a CPU waterblock can go anywhere from $40-$90 depending on brand, EK GPU waterblocks are roughly $130 and the backplate to go along with it is around $30-40. You can save some money and get a pump+reservoir combo like a nice EK combo or a Photon 270 D5 which is what im running atm, or the smaller 170mm version for $160, and tubing is fairly cheap around $20. Coolant is optional, it has inbuilt nanoparticles that help prevent corrosion and has growth inhibitors but if you choose to just run distilled water, then you will need to buy biocide or a kill coil and keep the case away from sunlight and UV light. The most popular coolant brand is Mayhems, i personally use Mayhems Pastel White.     Performance PCs is the biggest watercooling part distributor in the US http://www.performance-pcs.com/water-cooling     Personally, i live in Sydney, so i buy from PC Case Gear www.pccasegear.com.au"

watercooling,3dyhpy,nakdawg,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:20:22 2015 UTC,"All threaded parts will be the standard G1/4 thread size, so they should all screw together without a problem. What you need to pay close attention to are the tube inner and outer diameters or ID/OD.  If you're going with soft tubing, it will be held together by slotting the tube over a barb that holds it in place. So you need to pay attention to the ID, if its a 12mm ID tube you want a compression fitting that fits a 12mm ID tube.  If you're going with hardline acrylic tubing, then the tubes will be held in place by compression fittings that hug the outside of the tube via an O-ring so you will need to pay attention to the OD of the tubing and get fittings that fit the same hardline OD."

Pwm is not necessary at all, better off getting a d5 vario and setting the speed as you wish - save costs and as most people do 'set and forget' once you find the right speed.  Keep in mind d5 is larger than DDC and quieter, in case that makes a difference.  Anyone more experienced feel free to chime in and correct."
watercooling,3dzxml,usually_sane,2,Mon Jul 20 23:14:56 2015 UTC,"Dammit, you beat me to it.    I wouldn't call pwm unnecessary though.  Some people might want to keep the speed at the lowest hand have it ramp up when computer is under load for a bit more effectiveness and for noise reasons.    If the pump is in a odd position where the dial can't be reached easily, pwm is beneficial there too.  But realistically, its up to OP how he wants to control his pump"
watercooling,3dzxml,nono0044,0,Mon Jul 20 23:42:49 2015 UTC,The D5 Vario is seeming like the better option. Thanks for your help!
watercooling,3dzxml,nono0044,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:42:23 2015 UTC,I have plenty of room for the D5 (Phanteks Enthoo Primo Ult.) so space won't be much of an issue. Quieter does sounds good. I like the idea of being able to set the speed and leaving it. How often will the speed need to be adjusted anyway?!
watercooling,3dzxml,cooperred,2,Mon Jul 20 23:38:47 2015 UTC,"Whoops, deleted my post since it was pretty much what /u/usually_sane had already written.  Some people are just crazy about noise, so they want their pump to be as quiet as possible until there needs to be faster flow.  Have a Vario would make that kind of tricky.    If you aren't like that, getting a vario and having it set to something functional and bearable is completely okay."
watercooling,3dzxml,nono0044,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:41:12 2015 UTC,"So let me get this straight, the PWM function speeds up and slows down the pump as the temperature rises and falls?"
watercooling,3dzxml,cooperred,3,Mon Jul 20 23:54:07 2015 UTC,"PWM pumps is exactly the same thing as PWM in fans. You can set up a custom fan curve to have it ramp up and down at a certain temperature.   Honestly, I don't see a point to it. My D5 vario is at 3 and it's silent, and that's as much flow rate as I need. I don't see any lower temps with it at 5."
watercooling,3dzxml,Yeater,2,Tue Jul 21 00:17:29 2015 UTC,I wasn't suggesting that there'd be a huge difference from the highest setting to the lowest.

watercooling,3dzjmg,kevzhu,2,Mon Jul 20 20:43:33 2015 UTC,"The whole loop isnt even 2 weeks old.  I visually inspected everything and there are a lot of really tiny air bubbles on the CPU and GPU block. I ran the pump (D5) for a day at full speed and also turned the case in all directions after the first assembly and priming process. The pump runs really quiet at level 3 now. I have the feeling that air pockets, when set free, go to the pump, get whirled around and circulate back into the loop with only a small portion getting caught in my reservoir. Maybe my pump speed is too high? I use the bitspower 150mL upgrade kit on my D5 pump top. Since the loop is so young there is no gunk buildup visible (clear tubes + liquid + blocks) I also cleaned the rads thoroughly before frist assembly."

watercooling,3dxg66,Overpunk,1 point,Mon Jul 20 09:48:01 2015 UTC,"It really depends if you have the money for it, and if you will be able to unload your old hardware when Pascal eventually gets released. Fitting size and tubing size must be the same in order for your system to not leak.  The size of tubing really depends on how you want your build to look.  Thinner tubing is usually easier to make bends and curves with, but can be prone to kinking.  Thicker tubing is usually stiffer.  Since you're doing a custom desk build, you have control over the spacing of your components, so just go with the dimensions that will look the best.  Most if not all fittings will be g1/4 threaded as are the ports on the radiators/blocks/reservoirs.  So tubing size is relatively irrelevant to compatibility.  Compression fittings are a bit more secure, and in my opinion look better.  Both type of fittings are around the same level of complexity to use. Problem has been resolved like years ago. If you can get your hands on fans that have good static pressure ratings, then just go with the thickest radiators you can.  Since you are building your desk from scratch, you don't have as much space constraints as a retail case would have.  Thicker rads means you can run your fans at lower speed, thus less noise and vibrations. At a minimum, you should have 2 fans per 240 rad.  Push or pull is around the same, and push+pull isn't really needed.  You can do it if you have the luxury of space and have the money for fans.   D5 if you have space, DDC if you have space constraints.  PWM if you don't have easy access to your pump, vario if you do or don't have enough pwm headers. If you connect them directly to your PSU, they'll be running at full speed.  Find a PWM hub or fan controller to be able to control the speed of your fan to something thats both tolerable and functional. Really no difference.  Premix just takes away the fact that you have to mix the concentrate yourself. Should be okay.  You can, but generally might be more expensive since they're shipping the parts from Europe.  Check the ""where to buy"" in the wiki to see which retailer would be the most cost effective for you. Generally nothing but the psu and pump are supposed to be plugged in.  That way if anything spills, you have time to dry components to avoid a short.  A good tip is to cover or wrap fittings in paper towel to soak up potential leaks, and it acts as a good visual indicator as to where there are leaks (if there are any)"

I would grab some 45/90deg fittings as-well, they can make the world of difference. It can be very hard to have a bend straight before going into a component. if you have a drawing of your loop im sure we could suggest places you could use them to save you the hassle Dont forget to remove every source of power before taking water near the system, including CMOS battery (this will reset your CMOS) dont cheap out on a drain, its hard enough to do with one, trying to hold it upside down will probably only cause more problems than it saves in the $10 fitting."

Watercooling RAM is pretty much an aesthetic choice; it will make almost no measurable difference in performance, neither will the extra 200Mhz outside of synthetic benchmarks.  If you have any more watercooling-related questions then you're in the right place, but BAPC is more relevant for the other bits."
watercooling,3dwbvv,kevzhu,1 point,Mon Jul 20 10:11:25 2015 UTC,"There is no way to futureproof really. Water cooling lowers temps and can increase longevity of components, but you'll be upgrading long before these parts start failing. Even with an OC as long as the temps are normal of course  But yes you could eek out an extra maybe 5-10% on liquid with same temps"

If you're putting the barb end at the back of the case you'll have issues mounting a rear 25mm fan. If you put barbs at back you might be able to squeeze a 360 in the front, ditch the dust screen and put fans outside in push and maybe put a rear fan outside the case. I don't have any experience with slim fans.   I almost fit two 420's with some mods, but decided it's not worth it.

watercooling,3dq3iv,scenezx,2,Sat Jul 18 10:09:03 2015 UTC,"I'd go with Alphacool or EK radiators (360mm on top, 240mm on bottom). If you've got one Heatkiller block, go ahead and put another on on your video card.  Soft tubing is easier for noobs. Bitspower and EK make good fittings (I would use compression fittings). EK makes good CPU blocks, and you can get a good EK D5 pump/res combo.  Push-pull fans are totally unnecessary. Just do one or the other. I would stay away from SP120s (loud) and get something like the EK Vardar or Gentle Typhoons."

Currently the reason im not water cooling the other GPU is solely for budget, it will be coming in the next month or two however.   Is there any kits you can recommend i should be looking at?"
watercooling,3dq3iv,PC_Builder12,1 point,Sat Jul 18 12:22:59 2015 UTC,"You need some high static pressure fans for your radiator. Noctua make great fans but they're not always the best radiator fans.  The Vardars and GTs are time-tested good radiator fans. I think a pull setup with the fans on top sounds great (I have mine on top pulling in cold air through the rad).  I would hold off until you get everything together (including your GPU blocks). The reason why is that draining and refilling your loop is not an easy or quick thing to do.  I don't recommend kits in general, though any EK kit should be good (I like EK products, if you can't tell). I prefer to mix and match different components to maximize value and get a good custom setup for your case."

Ideally if it helps im looking at removing the Optical drive bay where possible to free up room, i was thinking this would be a great location for the pump/res to be housed as i prefer the look of reservoirs like the Photon in comparison to a 5.25"" bay.

Fill port goes in the top of your reservoir (mine is just an extra hose with a fill port ending) and drain port at the lowest point of your loop (mine is currently stuck on my bottom rad, which is NOT reflected in the pictures of my loop).

Like /u/eQuiFY mentioned, the Swiftech H140-X, H220-X and H240-X are either a 140mm, 240mm or 280mm radiator (respectively) with a pump and small reservoir attached to it.   Depending on whether you can have a 140mm rad on top and a 240mm/280mm rad in front, getting the H140-x would be your best bet in getting the most radiator space out of your case."

watercooling,3dm43h,BWAAMP,4,Fri Jul 17 11:24:10 2015 UTC,"This will be your first watercooling rig, right? Because then it'll be tough. The h440 is quite small, especially if you want to cool two gpus and a cpu. But it's possible and if you plan it out and be patient, you should be able to do it.  Also, loop order doesn't matter. Before, or after cpu, between cpu and gpu... doesn't matter. The only important thing is that your res is connected to your pump, so there is no chance that it'll ever run dry. Because that kills your pump.  When it comes to radiator thickness, there are two things to consider: your fans and the available space. Thicker radiators allow for lower fin density, which in turn allows for fans with lower static pressure. You'll probably get slightly better cooling performance with thicker rads, but if you don't go below 30mm in thickness, you should be fine. I always go with 45mm thickness and static pressure optimized fans. I think it's a good compromise, but that's just personal preference."
watercooling,3dm43h,Version467,1 point,Fri Jul 17 12:31:03 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply. Yes, first watercooling rig, but I'm in no rush. I'm quite looking forward to taking some holiday, sitting down and carefully planning and assembling :). Hopefully with a rez/pump combo, running the pump dry shouldn't be too much of an issue.   Thanks a lot for the radiator advice, I'll try and stay above 30mm. But I remember reading somewhere that 30mm is about the maximum for any radiator mounted to the inside top of my case if you want space for fans as well. So perhaps a compromise, 30 mm for that radiator and as large as reasonable for the front radiator? Will one pump be enough for all the waterblocks and radiators in one loop?   Do you think I should be pulling air through the radiators and into the case, exhausting it with a rear fan, or the other way round? Or both?"
watercooling,3dm43h,Version467,2,Fri Jul 17 12:39:24 2015 UTC,"Well, your case prevents you from mounting a bottom radiator, which is what I'd normally do. Rule of thumb is 120mm radiator per component + 120mm extra, so you are good to go with 480mm of radiator space. You could mount a 360mm rad in the front as intake and a 120mm as a rear exhaust rad. But if theres enough space, then I'd mount a 360mm rad in the front as intake (probably thin, because of harddrives etc.), a normal rear exhaust air flow optimized fan (140mm) and a 240mm top exhaust radiator (as thick as possible).  If you don't care about looks, then go with noctua nf-f12 fans as pressure optimized fans, they are the best performing fans you can get, but look like total crap. If they are too ugly for you (and thats totally okay), then go with corsair sp120's.  Also, you should be fine with your pump, you won't need a second loop."
watercooling,3dm43h,Version467,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:35:43 2015 UTC,Thanks so much for all the advice man. I'll go for a 360 and 240 then I think. I'm very temped by EKs new all white Vulcan Vardar(I think that's the name) fans. They're meant to be comparable to the nocturnal fans right? I'm not too fussed about looks. But for the price I'd rather have something a bit more....good looking.

watercooling,3dm43h,Gosthunter02,2,Fri Jul 17 16:33:22 2015 UTC,EK Vardar fans are excellent for radiators as well. I believe they are supposed to offer better pressure/noise ratio than Noctuas or SP120s. They're more expensive than the SP120s though.
watercooling,3dm43h,Yeater,2,Fri Jul 17 16:23:27 2015 UTC,"After having completely my H440 Watercooling build, I used the same pump/res as you. No issues with it getting liquid through my entire loop. My loop components go as follow:  Pump/Res > 360mm Front Rad (30mm thick) > 2x GTX 970s > 240mm Top Rad (30mm thick) > 4690k > Pump/Res  I took out all my hard drive space and the bending will be VERY tight for you. I have my res mounted as low as possible for easy convenience, but there is not much room to be left if you include 30mm rad + 25mm fans. I also have my fans on the outside of my case and I can see room for just fans and a 30mm thick rad on the front and that is it. You will have maybe 5mm of space between your res and your gpus.  To give you an idea of how my loop is setup: http://imgur.com/a/h9Vur"
watercooling,3dm43h,eQuiFY,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:59:45 2015 UTC,Nice build! Thanks for the advice :)  It looks like I'm going for something very similar for you in terms of configuration. Its reassuring to see such a success.  Removing the hard drive cage was always something I was going to do (how did you find removing the rivets). But I hadn't thought of widening the window. It looks fantastic dude. I might do the same. Did you just source a larger piece of plastic?
watercooling,3dm43h,plgdg,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:13:33 2015 UTC,"Taking out the rivets was extremely easy. If I remember correctly, it was only 8 rivets you take out, and then one screw which holds the cage to the PSU shroud.   For the window, I just went to Home Depot and bought an 18""x24"" piece of acrylic and then cut it down to size. Ended up being 16""x16"" roughly, maybe a little smaller but right around there."

You say you recommend it but is it really important? If so you might make it clear on the store page of your website that you need an additional product for installation. I had some Noctua NT-H1 laying around so I used that but will there be a problem (of the fire variety) if people don't put anything there?  For the record I also think including relevant instructions in the box would help, mine came with instructions for fitting the 290x block. Not a problem though as I had already downloaded the Fury X PDF from the product page.  The block and (especially) the backplate are beautifully made though!

And should I do each card separately? (I have 3 980 Ti's) I have two power supplies, one for the computer components and one to run all of the water cooling components, fans, and lights. Whats the recommended way to get them to both start up together? In yall's opinion, would you recommend doing the custom wire creation and management first or running the loops to all the parts first? I was thinking to do the wiring first so I could make sure its hidden and also plan my loop accordingly to hide any extra wires that I need to hide."
watercooling,3dmfgj,swimming-bird,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:40:47 2015 UTC,Just go to boot screen - as long as your screen is running off the gpu and it boots - chances are its fine. Some people like to do stress tests though to make sure it's working Not sure what to recommend. Maybe creating a standalone switch for the secondary PSU? Run the loops first and then figure out how you're going to do the cables.

watercooling,3dmg08,darkrobstar,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:37:35 2015 UTC,Looks good - can't complain about a couple of 980Tis underwater. Do you have any fans running intake? Looks like you've got 6 120mm fans in exhaust - might want to add a couple of intakes on filtered positions to reduce dust buildup.
watercooling,3dmg08,Nyxi26,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:28:14 2015 UTC,I'm planning to have two 120's in the front for intake one I get the loop under control.  I've having really high CPU temps under load (90C in aida and mid 80C during cinebench)  Gpu temps under load are stellar under 40C.  I've reseated the CPU at least 3 times and am getting really frustrated with it.  Current loop gos reservoir/pump > 240 Res > 980ti x1 > 980 ti x2 > 360 Res > CPU.  I'm debating wheter to switch the direction of my loop to flow in the CPU before the video cards but I don't think that would matter.
watercooling,3dmg08,Nyxi26,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:07:15 2015 UTC,"Right - might be good to add them asap. There's going to be such a small inflow of air that it could actually be affecting your cooling.  Are you using the correct inlet/outlet ports on the CPU block? Possible stupid question - have you removed the plastic protector from teh copper bit? Also bear in mind that Aida/Cinebench are artificial tests and 'real' load won't create that much stress. Even on a horribly optimised game like Arma 3 running at max I'm easily 15c lower than running Prime95.  You're correct that the order won't matter, the fluid will quickly reach a sort of equilibrium. Something is definitely up with that CPU temp though."
watercooling,3dmg08,Mcinfopopup,1 point,Sun Jul 19 09:04:32 2015 UTC,"Just a thought, but have you thought about mounting that 240 to the front where the drive cages used to be instead of on the bottom like that?  If i'm not mistaken, you can mount 2 120's in place of the 140's in the front.  Or it might be the other way around."
watercooling,3dmg08,Mcinfopopup,1 point,Sun Jul 19 06:06:43 2015 UTC,I want to have space for 3 of my mechanical drives and I want to try to keep most of their cables hidden so thats why I have the 240 on the bottom.    What I could do though is move those (hard drives) in the optical drive bay up top and then have the 240 on the front.  I'm trying to make sure I have enough space for the odd pump mount (uses a raised bracket off a 120 fan).    I was also debating on using some black zipties and mount it on the same panel as the motherboard   Similar to this pic.
watercooling,3dljcn,roguexx117,2,Fri Jul 17 06:29:34 2015 UTC,"A google search suggests that tubing might have plasticizer issues. I'd recommend you go for something such as Primochill Advanced LRT instead.   Don't forget to get a top for that pump.  You don't need a kill coil. If you're worried about growth, use a couple of drops of PT Nuke instead.  MS paint drawing is fine!  Re drainage, I have an in-line T fitting with a Bitspower ball valve at the bottom of my loop. The valve stays closed with a plug for backup, but to drain I remove the plug, attach a barb fitting with a foot of tubing.

watercooling,3dls31,Pirate_Islands,3,Fri Jul 17 08:29:16 2015 UTC,A good rule of thumb is to use a 120mm for each component to be cooled and double that amount for a more silent operation.  So in your case 240 will be fine and 360 or 480 will give you less noise.
watercooling,3dls31,JoaoSeverino,2,Fri Jul 17 11:08:10 2015 UTC,"A 240 will suffice  I cooled an OC'd 4670k and 980 with a 240 pe coolstream radiator. Temps were not impressive, but not bad.

watercooling,3dez84,darkrobstar,4,Wed Jul 15 22:17:04 2015 UTC,"The primary reason I watercool is because I want a silent system. The overclock I currently have on the CPU gives me all the performance I ever need for my purposes while also not generating a ton of excess heat. The Haswell-E chips are known to run really hot, especially this one having six cores. Keeping the OC to a reasonable 4.1 let's me run my fans at low RPMs giving me the silent build I wanted while also keeping temps low."

watercooling,3dfvn1,doprahwinfreyIII,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:39:55 2015 UTC,"So, you are trying to phase change a computer right?  I too am also confused."
watercooling,3dfvn1,knightman412,1 point,Thu Jul 16 05:07:52 2015 UTC,i'm using a case that has a built in water cooling system to cool 6x 100watt peltier devices (600 watts total) which in turn cools down a second layer to about 40 degree (40 lower than room temperature) this than in turns cools down the final area to sub zero. (this can be used in computer cooling solutions as well which is why i thought i could come here for suggestions) i don't think anyone has preformed this. so. i guess ill be the first to try!   and yes. its basicly phase change minus the $1000+ in hardware and is far far more energy consumed... but hey. its mostly for the experience! :D
watercooling,3dfvn1,YouGotAte,1 point,Thu Jul 16 06:18:48 2015 UTC,"From what I got a peltier is an air heat sink? Pulling heat from the air and dispersing it the other side to cool it there(usually in a large passively cooled radiator)? (The way fridges work). Anyway, if it is, you can apply any heat dispersion ideas you want. And if you can combine them in a loop, then think of the peltiers as a water block with 100 watt TDP (or is it different). And then build your wc loop ontop of that? I have no knowledge in this field but I assume as long as you went about it logically it wouldn't be too hard to do."
watercooling,3dfjyl,AnonAmus89,3,Wed Jul 15 21:43:16 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't order from FrozenCPU. They say that they're taking orders again, but they still haven't fulfilled many orders/refunds from before, and are on shaky footing at absolute best (they still owe EK a 6-figure sum iirc). And if you didn't follow the drama from earlier this year, the owner went on a 2 AM (allegedly) drug/alcohol fueled rampage and basically trashed their office/warehouse and fired all of the employees. So I'd be wary if I were you.  The parts that you have look good, but you'll need a pump if you want the water to go anywhere lol. A Laing D5 variant is the standard recommendation. I assume you are planning to use distilled water to fill the loop? If so you'll probably want some sort of biocide, either a silver coil or PT Nuke."

watercooling,3ddo6f,Kautkto,2,Wed Jul 15 19:46:14 2015 UTC,The pressure drop off with the second res will be too much for a single pump. You'll need a pump on each reservoir.
watercooling,3ddo6f,LOLCANADA,2,Wed Jul 15 22:14:52 2015 UTC,"I actually looked it up a bit more now that I'm home and it appears the performance drop is fairly negligible.

watercooling,3dbxnl,s4in7,2,Wed Jul 15 21:16:37 2015 UTC,"Ah, awesome. I'll keep digging whether my water pump / reservoir unit EK-XRES 100 DDC MX can handle a GPU added to the loop. My rad is the same as yours."
watercooling,3dbxnl,SunAndCigarrets,3,Wed Jul 15 21:34:04 2015 UTC,"Oh yes, it can."
watercooling,3dcvbm,kevzhu,2,Wed Jul 15 07:30:02 2015 UTC,"Very nice. I would've maybe given it a go with a different coolant color to bring out the wonderful sleeving colors, but that's just my mind wandering places."
watercooling,3dcvbm,drunkenvalley,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:25:57 2015 UTC,"Interesting.. perhaps a black, grey, or chocolate coolant could be a good compliment. Hmm..."
watercooling,3dcvbm,saddrake,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:15:24 2015 UTC,That is a very nice looking build.
watercooling,3ddznv,ScrubbyPCMasterRace,4,Wed Jul 15 15:06:52 2015 UTC,"First, I recommend going with good quality tubing. If you're going soft tubing, Primochill Advanced LRT is the best. If you're going hard tubing, you have more options, although again, I prefer Primochill's acrylic tubing (and it works perfectly with their hardline fittings). If you go for cheap tubing that isn't plasiticizer-free, you'll end up with clogged blocks-- no matter what your coolant choice is.   Second, colored coolant gives you way more options and IMHO, looks better than colored tubing-- esp if you have transparent blocks or a reservoir where the coolant will be visible.   Third, cleaning isn't that big of a deal. Yes, the tubing will be stained by colored coolant over time. Some colors stain more than others. If you're using soft tube, you should probably swap out all the tubes once a year anyway, so staining isn't really a factor there. For stains inside of blocks, just some vinegar and a toothbrush will clean any stain right up.  Maintenance is a big part of a watercooling loop. It's not like an air cooled machine where you can set it and forget it aside from cleaning out dust every now and again. You'll want to properly plan a drain port so that draining the loop isn't a total nightmare, then drain coolant, clean components and switch out tubing + coolant at least every year or year and a half."
watercooling,3ddznv,specikk,2,Wed Jul 15 17:24:17 2015 UTC,"All dye will eventually stain clear tubing, but red is notorious for it. If you're building this for someone else you're probably better off using coloured tubing and plain old distilled water - less chance of them  complaining about discolouration later on."
watercooling,3ddznv,Nyxi26,2,Wed Jul 15 17:26:54 2015 UTC,"At work right now so I don't really have anything in front of me, but just putting this out there.  Have you considered colored tubing?  Usually you can find whatever color tubing you want, unless you were going for something UV."
watercooling,3ddznv,Mcinfopopup,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:43:03 2015 UTC,"I may go coloured tubing actually, it's easier and will suit the buyer more easily.  He wants a Red and Black dye build, but it sounds like it'll be hard to clean out."
watercooling,3ddznv,Mcinfopopup,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:48:47 2015 UTC,"In the end it should be easier for everyone.  I had clear tubing with some blue primochill and only after, maybe 6-8 months the tubing was stained blue. This way you can also save on coolant"
watercooling,3ddznv,niceandcreamy,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:03:52 2015 UTC,Have you thought about premixed or concentrate coolant? Comes will all additives and it seems to be much easier to clean than dyed water. You can also use pastel colors if you go that route.
watercooling,3ddznv,Kautkto,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:40:41 2015 UTC,"Mayhems pastel doesn't stain, and contains corrosion and growth inhibitors as well."

watercooling,3ddznv,cykbryk,-4,Wed Jul 15 16:24:16 2015 UTC,"Don't use dyes. Flush your components with a vinegar/water solution, and just use DISTILLED water for your coolant."
watercooling,3ddznv,niceandcreamy,3,Wed Jul 15 18:03:28 2015 UTC,Don't flush nickle plated components with vinegar and there really isn't anything wrong with dyes.

watercooling,3ddznv,Kautkto,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:24:33 2015 UTC,Each to their own. If you can avoid contamination and the loop will not have windows or uv light near it then plain distilled will work.
watercooling,3de37q,nDQ9UeOr,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:33:12 2015 UTC,"When did you buy the pump? The reason I ask is that for a long time almost all D5 PWM pumps did not actually follow Intel's spec for PWM and therefore RPMs could not be read by almost all modern devices (motherboards, fan controllers, etc that adhere to the correct spec).   EK introduced an updated version at some point of the D5 that conforms to the proper spec and therefore reports RPMs properly via PWM. You may just have an earlier variant of the pump that doesn't adhere to the spec. The only D5's that currently conform to the correct PWM spec are the new EK D5 variant and Aquacomputer's D5 pump.   As a side note, there is a (rather ugly) mod you can make to the PWM cable to make it conform to Intel's PWM spec.  It would be worth trying to figure out which revision of the EK D5 you have, that'll tell you if you're getting expected behavior or not."
watercooling,3de37q,specikk,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:00:54 2015 UTC,"Thank you, I read up on that issue as well and figured a warranty replacement would be more desirable than soldering resistors.  The pump doesn't appear to have a serial number or anything else that would help identify if it's the older or newer style, or at least EK hasn't told me how to do that if there is.  I purchased from Performance-PCs.com."
watercooling,3de37q,specikk,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:26:51 2015 UTC,"Do you still have the original box? May be something on there that can help identify.   In terms of the warranty situation, I'm not sure where this falls since technically the PWM signal RPM issue is not a defect, just a result of the PWM spec used not being up to standard.   I wonder if /u/EK_Luc can chime in here?"
watercooling,3de37q,Kingdud,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:39:11 2015 UTC,"I do still have the box, so if there's a way to extract a serial number I would be able to. I didn't spot one on it either, though. Weird that there doesn't seem to be any way to track an individual part.  If speed reporting doesn't conform to spec and as a result is non-functional, it's defective. Just 'cause it happened in design and not manufacturing doesn't change that, as the end result is it doesn't do what it's supposed to do.  Edit: I hope I didn't come off as snarky, I know you are trying to help me and I appreciate it."
watercooling,3de37q,Andrej_ID,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:38:16 2015 UTC,"Sadly a lot of warranties have this feature of 'We'll RMA it, but shipping both ways is on you.' Some say it's to discourage RMA abuse, but really it's just because they can."
watercooling,3de09r,S2005,2,Wed Jul 15 15:10:57 2015 UTC,"First and foremost, your drain should be at the lowest part of the loop, usually the bottom of your case. It should be known that no matter how solid your draining strategy, it's almost always a PITA. Even with a drain port, you'll still have to tilt and rotate your case to try and get all the coolant out.   Either option you listed works fine, but I would say for the purposes of minimizing flow restrictions, a 3-way splitter with a valve is the way that I would go.   And you were told correctly. Do not order from FrozenCPU-- there are people that paid for their orders months ago and never got their order or their money back. The owner went nuts and trashed the place. PPC is the best option if you're in the US. And Amazon isn't really the place to go for WC gear. There tends to be huge price markups on stuff by the sort of shady third-party sellers on there."
watercooling,3de09r,specikk,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:17:40 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much for replying! I was greatly leaning to the 3 way as well.   So, these ball valves I see on PPC, and Amazon that are ""specifically"" for water cooling are quite a bit more expensive that the basic copper ones you can get at Home Depot...   Have you ever heard of people using the ones from a local hardware store? Is there a reason not to?"
watercooling,3de09r,specikk,2,Wed Jul 15 18:43:16 2015 UTC,"People have used non-watercooling specific parts in the past. I personally haven't, so I can't speak from experience but I can think of a few general things:  Finding G 1/4 thread valves at Home Depot, but since it's a standard measurements, maybe not so difficult. The other is the metals, you don't want anything aluminum in your loop."
watercooling,3de09r,niceandcreamy,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:51:30 2015 UTC,"Indeed, I've heard to never ever use aluminium.   Right now, I think I'm solid copper, with some brass (Rad internals) and a silver kill coil.   I'll probably just get all my parts from PPC to play it safe...   What about tubing? Am I safe going with PrimoFlex?"
watercooling,3de09r,tengen,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:02:27 2015 UTC,"G 1/4 isn't really ""standard."" 1/4"" pipe thread is standard all over the place but the G means that the threads are uniform and not tapered. Most pipe threads seal themselves without an o-ring."
watercooling,3de09r,specikk,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:44:14 2015 UTC,"The 1/4"" threads you see from Home Depot are NPT 1/4"", they are not self-sealing and are not parallel, and will not fit into BSPP G1/4"" common with water cooling gear.  You need an adapter to convert BSPP G1/4"" to NPT 1/4"", then you can have a heyday with Home Depot plumbing, but don't expect your loop to look nice because you will need a wrench to guarantee airtightness (aka paint chips)."
watercooling,3de09r,nakdawg,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:01:24 2015 UTC,"Also, I'm strongly considering THIS thing.   And, what do you think about Mayhem X1?"
watercooling,3dd978,ezaboti,2,Wed Jul 15 10:44:18 2015 UTC,"That radiator is listed as 12-14FPI so it's somewhat below average in terms of restriction (which is good for you) although afaik most 'stealth' rads tend to be <10FPI to counterbalance fans running at very low RPMs. In terms of the single 140mm size, using the Hybrid card reviews as a rough benchmark and considering the fin density it does seem like you'd need to run the fan at an audible RPM. I guess a high quality static pressure optimised fan could negate this, though.  I can't speak for pump noise but that entire unit is a similar price to a D5 pump and imho you get what you pay for with watercooling parts. Expect it to be similar to most any AIO in that price range.  Tl;dr - I don't think there's any doubt that unit would cool your card and be quieter than the stock cooler, but I wouldn't be confident of silence."
watercooling,3dd978,Nyxi26,1 point,Wed Jul 15 12:42:14 2015 UTC,At idle it may be silent though. Depends on fan curves and how hot he is willing to let things get.
watercooling,3ddoua,kenny4351,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:38:21 2015 UTC,"Distilled water is the classic (and by far the cheapest) method, but you'll need something like PT Nuke or a silver kill coil to prevent biological growth. Clear tubing can sometimes get cloudy over time due to the composition of the tubing (though I think there are some tubing brands that remedy this, and it isn't an issue for hardline acrylic/PETG tubing). If you really want a colored coolant, I like Mayhems Pastel line."
watercooling,3ddoua,derezzed19,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:08:25 2015 UTC,Should I be afraid of clogging up my parts with Mayhems Pastel?
watercooling,3ddoua,derezzed19,2,Wed Jul 15 14:22:54 2015 UTC,It's not really an issue. I've heard that some tubing materials can cause issues with it but as long as you do your research (all of the tubing material compatibility is on Mayhems website) I think you'll be fine. For reference I'm personally running Mayhems Pastel Ice White with Primochill LRT tubing. Just make sure to flush out all of your parts/your whole assembled loop thoroughly with distilled water before filling it with the coolant.
watercooling,3ddoua,specikk,2,Wed Jul 15 14:27:59 2015 UTC,"As long as you're using plasticizer-free tubing like Primochill Advanced LRT,  you won't clog anything up. When you read old forums of people blaming coolants for clogging blocks, the fault was actually of the tubing they used.   Plasticizer would leech from the tube over time and deposit itself on surfaces like the jet plate of blocks. The coolant would then over time dye this deposited plasticizer. When taking a block apart, it would be easy to insinuate that the coolant was responsible since the deposits would be whatever color your coolant was.   Fast forward to now, as long as you get good tubing, clogging isn't an issue. Colored coolants may stain blocks or soft tubing over time, but staining in blocks can easily be cleaned with vinegar and a toothbrush. Just have a good maintenance routine in place and everything will be fine."
watercooling,3ddoua,Dizz_ee,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:10:45 2015 UTC,"I'm using the ek pastel coolant, from what I've read it's pretty much then same stuff as mayhems. Can't really speak for long term since it's only been a week, but so far so good.   I'm using monsoon acrylic tubing too."

watercooling,3d9n6y,OttermanEmpire,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:20:19 2015 UTC,"Their build quality has always been top notch, it's good to see that hasn't changed. As one of the few remaining people using high rpm 38mm fans, I'm bummed that mass tests like these never cover my usage, so I just have to extrapolate and hope.  Looking at the 1850 performance, my venerable GTX 360 catches up and passes EK's XE, which seems to say insane fan users should still stick to the GTX. My H101's likely already have their best match for a radiator."
watercooling,3d9n6y,Dizz_ee,2,Wed Jul 15 02:40:23 2015 UTC,"Yes that is why I switched from a nemesis gtx to the sr2. The sr2 is the best performer at low rpm push only set ups which is what I run, while the gtx was more about performance at high rpms."

However, if silence is golden to you - i suggest a 360 + 240 rad will cool your setup (+ another GPU in the future).   Tube res are easier to fill and your loop is easier to bleed.   PETG is much more forgiving when it comes to bending.   Either will work.   All the fittings now are G 1/4.  Size doesn't matter, just as long as your tubing matches your fittings.

watercooling,3daqbw,b0yd07,3,Tue Jul 14 23:18:40 2015 UTC,I would raise the same issue as above. Each pump should have a separate pipe from your res or a single larger diameter pipe so you can achieve the same flow per pump.

watercooling,3d6b1a,PM_ME_YOUR_CHESTHAMS,2,Mon Jul 13 21:37:32 2015 UTC,"im not familiar with the 240X but from what ive googled, it looks like a presetup loop that has a cpu block with tubing to a radiator+res+pump combo? Can you undo the fittings and customise it?     Essentially any custom loop will have at least one of these parts: waterblocks (cpu and/or gpu) radiator(s) reservoir pump (may be combined with reservoir)       Each of these parts connect together so that the water flows through each component forming a loop (hence the term, custom loop). Therefore every part will have at least two points of entry/exit, so from that you can figure out what fittings you need.     e.g for something similar to your system  you start by filling your combination radiator>reservoir>pump, water fills that pump which shoots that water OUT, so thats => 1 compression fitting water goes IN to the cpu, then OUT of the cpu => 2 compression fittings water goes IN gpu block, then OUT gpu = > 2 compression fittings water goes back IN your radiator to complete the loop => 1 compression fitting       So thats 6 fittings. However, like i said, i dont have first had experience with the 240X system, all i know is that its prepackaged as a finished loop that goes res>pump>cpu>rad, so does it already have 4 fittings? Can you unplug it and feed it through to the gpu as well? Those things you have to figure out yourself."
watercooling,3d6b1a,nakdawg,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:55:34 2015 UTC,"I was curious about the 240X as well.  On their site it shows a build with different tubes and fittings.  My best guess is you can customize them, but as far as how easy it is, no clue. A little more reading and I found this    The system can be entirely customized thanks to easily replaceable tubing and fittings. Thanks to its powerful pump it can support additional liquid cooled components such as graphics cards and/or additional radiator(s). The factory fittings can now be upgraded to any G1/4 compatible after-market fittings (an optional adapter is needed for the pump outlet and is available here, which allows enthusiast users to upgrade their system to 1/2"" ID tubing if they wish to."
watercooling,3d6b1a,Mcinfopopup,1 point,Tue Jul 14 12:57:27 2015 UTC,"You'll need 46 fittings. Rotary or angular fittings are not strictly necessary, and it's better (but more expensive) to buy a rotary fitting + angular adapter than a angular rotary fitting."

watercooling,3d4i9m,niceandcreamy,2,Mon Jul 13 20:24:17 2015 UTC,I've been doing research on this exact question for a while. If you have a high FPI radiator and good enough fan I believe that this will work. The temps wont be spectacular but it should be enough space. Using a higher FPI radiator like the EK Coolstream 180 and the Silverstone AP180 fan should keep it cooler than the rad you linked.   Also if you consider a 180mm rad is more than a dual 120 this doesn't seem too crazy. The fury X uses a single 120mm radiator already so you have 120mm+ left for the CPU.
watercooling,3d4i9m,Lee_Doe,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:45:06 2015 UTC,"So the loss of thisckness wouldn't matter? I looked into the available radiators, and the one I linked is 45mm thick, whereas the EK Coolstream is 35mm.   I will use the included Silverstone AP 181, so the fan should be golden."
watercooling,3d4i9m,niceandcreamy,2,Mon Jul 13 21:51:31 2015 UTC,The EK rad has 38 FPI vs the alphacool which is like 8-12 (I can't actually find the amount. Thats almost triple the fin density for 2/3 the radiator thickness. That SP181 is also a crazy good fan which should push air right through the dense EK rad.

Lower is always better, of course, but power FETs are large, built to take a beating, and are nowhere near as fragile as a CPU. They often are specced out for safe operation for over 100C. (edit: some cheaper ones are apparently good to 85. I would check documentation or ask Asus). Graphics card VRMs often reach 100 with no problems. Wouldn't worry about it.  I just ran Prime95 just then and AI Suite reckons my VRM is at a lukewarm 40C (listed as ""VCORE"" in software, which bothers me because Haswell doesn't work like that, the motherboard doesn't generate Vcore).

You will need lots of lots of 90 single, double, or triple rotaries for tight turns, and possibly 45s. Take installation order into account, because some pipes only fit a certain way in certain order, otherwise they'll bump into each other. This also applies to installing one end first than the other, because it makes a difference. You will need some male-male and female-female adapters, and possibly rotary adapters. You will need a good ruler to mark lengths and take into consideration the amount of tubing your push-fitting will occupy. You need a pipe reamer and a pipe cutter. You need a good pipe bender, I recommend Ridgid or Swagelok.  It takes hours to modify loops or change components because it's not flexible.

I think they both have their places and one shouldn't just be avoided at all costs.

And what is so wrong with the Backplate?  Read the manual to see which Backplate to use for your system.
watercooling,3d5oes,Yeater,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:50:02 2015 UTC,"Wip. No pics published, but doing a build log. I'm still not sure if it's all gonna fit, tbh. The goal was to keep all the components inside the thing, but I may have to cut some of the side panel to make a bit of space"

watercooling,3d2owr,DanielF823,3,Mon Jul 13 01:19:06 2015 UTC,Copper!  And be careful on the XSPC blocks.  Their metalwork is fine but I've had two of their Razor blocks strip out at the G1/4 ports.  Not sure if it's the material or their threading but I've been at this a long time and they're the only ones I've had that problem with.  Your mileage may vary.
watercooling,3d2owr,Retrosmith,1 point,Mon Jul 13 01:59:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah, their photon reservoirs have threading issues too."
watercooling,3d2owr,nono0044,1 point,Mon Jul 13 04:15:31 2015 UTC,"Got to be the material really.  The threads should be standard across the board regardless of manufacturer, but if they use a slightly softer (read: cheaper) POM material it would cause that.

watercooling,3d2owr,Retrosmith,1 point,Mon Jul 13 04:19:50 2015 UTC,Definitely an issue with their POM.  Their fitting have a tendency to shred their threading too.  /u/_Vova has been pointing out these issues with xspc for a while.

watercooling,3d2owr,tedlasman,1 point,Mon Jul 13 04:40:45 2015 UTC,That is truly a piece of art. It's a shame that almost every case has the GPU facing down and/or obscured. I think the hyper-expensive PC-O case series from Lian Li are the only cases where you can liquid cool and see the waterblock too.   I want to build an acrylic loop in one of these but theres no way I could justify the cost.
watercooling,3d2owr,Conpen,2,Mon Jul 13 05:35:29 2015 UTC,"Copper if you're using distilled water without pigment. Copper is a better conductor but will form oxide layers that hinder heat transfer if there are impurities in the water. Nickel is a bit less reactive that way, at the detriment of heat transfer. (But is the difference in heat transfer really significant enough to matter?? That I could not tell you). And go EK if you can afford it."
watercooling,3d2owr,mattv8,2,Mon Jul 13 05:24:45 2015 UTC,Be a hipster and mod away the pump and just keep the waterblock. That way you can keep the cool look. on the other hand it would stay 2slot that way.

watercooling,3d2643,alphanimal,3,Sun Jul 12 22:36:56 2015 UTC,"You seem to be over complicating things. A series loop with a valve and QD is the easiest way to use an external radiator. QD>VALVE>QD.

watercooling,3d2643,niceandcreamy,1 point,Mon Jul 13 00:11:34 2015 UTC,Open the valve when the rad isn't connected and close the valve when it is.   That's pretty much what I plan to do.

watercooling,3d2643,VengefulCaptain,3,Mon Jul 13 00:52:04 2015 UTC,If you wanted a multi loop setup why would you not have the Mobo and cpu block on the loop with the 120 mm rad and the GPUs in the loop with the 240 mm rad?  Probably would make tube routing much easier as the runs will be shorter.
watercooling,3d2643,crashbash2020,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:39:58 2015 UTC,"are you actually using the far right loop or is that an error? that would ""short circuit"" the external radiator and all the flow would go up that path instead of the external radiator.

watercooling,3d2643,pilg0re,1 point,Mon Jul 13 00:50:26 2015 UTC,The valve would be closed normally. Only opened when the external radiator is disconnected.
watercooling,3d2643,crashbash2020,1 point,Mon Jul 13 00:55:19 2015 UTC,Actually adding a valve to the output of a pump can increase its electrical efficiency as it's essentially adding head pressure to it. Restricting the intake is a big no no though as that can cause it cavitation and really mess up your pump.
watercooling,3d2643,Norman_the_Owl,1 point,Mon Jul 13 05:09:57 2015 UTC,"Assuming you are running above the optimal efficiency on the PQ curve, otherwise it makes it worse. In saying that because the pumps draw so little power in WC people tend to not care about efficiency."

Lots of room for rads and res's and shit while still having really good cable management options and mounting for a good number of storage drives. Only real issue I ran into was that the rear exhaust fan wouldn't fit with my top-mounted radiator (it's a pretty huge XSPC RX 360 V2, 63mm thick with 38mm Scythe Ultra Kaze's on it, and the fact that a mid tower could fit that rad with those fans at all is pretty impressive imo).

It has vibration dampening rubber where the 3.5"" drives mount and on the stock fans, and their noise-dampening insulation on the rear panel.

watercooling,3cwlzc,schwiing,1 point,Sat Jul 11 13:20:28 2015 UTC,That build looks sick! Digging the glow in the dark sleeving. Makes my build look silly and pale in comparison! Nice job.
watercooling,3cwlzc,searstream,2,Sat Jul 11 13:27:40 2015 UTC,"Thank you! You know I didn't even realize the sleeving was glow-in-the-dark at first because my brother got it for me as a gift, so it was a pretty pleasant surprise when I turned the lights out one night and the paracord was glowing."
watercooling,3cwlzc,ShortySim101,1 point,Sat Jul 11 14:02:23 2015 UTC,What kind of 140 phanteks did you use? I just got f140mp's and they're crazy nice. Which fans did you use for case fans and did you like them? I think I'm switching over to all phanteks. Great build btw.
watercooling,3cwlzc,ShortySim101,1 point,Sat Jul 11 13:51:10 2015 UTC,"Most of them are the standard, non-PMW fans. The two on top of the bottom radiator have white LEDs in them, but they don't really match the LED strips, so I leave them off. The Phanteks fans are pretty good. I have ten fans total and even with all of them running, I can barely hear them sitting five feet away."
watercooling,3cwlzc,Homeyjojo,1 point,Sat Jul 11 13:59:42 2015 UTC,"Do you used the ph-f140sp's that came with the case? Sorry for all the questions, I'm just also revamping my primo build and have fallen in love with the fans."
watercooling,3cwlzc,mattv8,1 point,Sat Jul 11 14:03:24 2015 UTC,"Yes. I don't mind the questions, it means I get to talk about my PC!"
watercooling,3cwlzc,Andrej_ID,1 point,Sat Jul 11 14:10:01 2015 UTC,"Alright, more questions then, are you using the default fan controller that came with it for all those push/Pull fans? I have a 280 in the bottom and a 480 in the top and from what I read in the manual I don't think I could do all the fans through the controller in push/pull."
watercooling,3cwlzc,Andrej_ID,1 point,Sat Jul 11 14:14:39 2015 UTC,"I am using the fan hub, but also four splitters. If I remember correctly you can have a splitter on all of the connection points except for the first one (top left?). If you do that though make sure you give it extra power through the molex connector. In your case though I think you would need another fan controller if you want to do push/pull on both radiators. Or plug the case fans direclty into the motherboard."
watercooling,3czj87,Sorgrum,1 point,Sun Jul 12 05:08:29 2015 UTC,"Are you sure you're going to have enough room for the 250 res?  I have a 150 in a Pro and have considered a 250 but it seems to maybe be too big.  Are you going to wait for the 980ti blocks to come out?  I know the Titan X will fit, but there are blocks specifically for the 980ti that are coming very soon.  Maybe the 12 pack may be a bit too much, maybe 2 packs of 4 would be more realistic.  But its up to you, you may end up needing more for practice since its your first time.  Also have you considered PETG?  Yes you will have enough.  But you can always thin out your coolant a bit with some distilled water.  Yes, its a good idea to have some on hand as some bends will be too tight or short.  90 degree adapters can help make things a bit easier.  No, do not use a silver coil if you plan to use mayhems pastel.  The coolant contains biocide and anti-corrosion agents already.  They advise you to only have the pastel in your loop, and aren't responsible if you add something extra into your loop and causes issues."
watercooling,3czj87,nono0044,1 point,Sun Jul 12 05:35:42 2015 UTC,"I didn't do an exact measurement, but I eyeballed it with my ruled and I think it'll fit well. I have a microATX motherboard so my case is pretty roomy. In the case that it doesn't fit vertically, would I have an issue mounting it horizontally? I was thinking below the motherboard if I had to do it horizontally.   I am most definitely going to wait for the new 980ti blocks to come out. I'm especially hoping that the 980ti version of the waterblock I chose won't have those circles on it.  I saw PETG and Acrylic, and I did a super quick google search and I thought Acrylic was the standard. Why do you think PETG would be better?   Yes you will have enough. But you can always thin out your coolant a bit with some distilled water.   Awesome. Was unsure of this, I really like the look of the strong color too.   Yes, its a good idea to have some on hand as some bends will be too tight or short. 90 degree adapters can help make things a bit easier.   So are there used in conjunction with the fittings? I'm not sure if they're a replacement or not.   No, do not use a silver coil if you plan to use mayhems pastel. The coolant contains biocide and anti-corrosion agents already. They advise you to only have the pastel in your loop, and aren't responsible if you add something extra into your loop and causes issues.   Sweet, another thing not to worry about."
watercooling,3czj87,nono0044,1 point,Sun Jul 12 14:57:38 2015 UTC,"Are you planning to use the bracket that attaches to the hard drive bays?  Because with a longer card like the 980ti, the bracket can cause the res to be right up against the card.  Also, with the spacing of the holes on the res bracket, the res will most likely be only clamped around the bottom of the res with nothing securing the top area of it.  Might not be a problem, but who knows.  You could put it horizontal, but you'd need to implement a filling system into your loop.  I personally would just stick with a slightly smaller res and keep it vertical for simplicity sakes for filling and bleeding.   PETG vs Acrylic   It is true that acrylic has been the standard for hard tubing at the beginning of hard tubing popularity, but PETG is starting to become a popular alternative.  Its a softer material compared to acrylic, so it isnt as prone to cracking from hard bounces or quick knocks.  In addition, it is easier to work with due to the softness and requires less heat to create bends.  BUT it does have its downsides.  Clear PETG sometimes has a slight blue-ish tint to it, and some batches have thin lines that run the length of the tubing.  So if you want crystal clear tubing, acrylic is the way to go.  The final thing about PETG is that it is water permeable.  This means that over a while, your coolant could evaporate through your tubing causing slow coolant loss.    Adapters   Yeah you screw one end into your blocks/rad/res (anything that has a g1/4 port) and screw the fitting on the other end."
watercooling,3czj87,nono0044,1 point,Sun Jul 12 16:09:37 2015 UTC,"I actually hadn't put too much thought into how I was going to mount the res. I thought that the case or the res would come with a convenient way to mount it. If I were to mount my res horizontally, could I turn my case on its side to fill up the rest and run the components with the entire casing tilted, or would I have to tilt the case to fill it, and then turn it back over to run it?  In this picture you can see how much space I have under my motherboard, which is what makes the horizontal res look so much nicer of an option.      it isnt as prone to cracking from hard bounces or quick knocks   This is a great pro for PETG, I'm going to be transporting my entire computer a few states over in a few months.       coolant could evaporate through your tubing causing slow coolant loss.    This is a pretty big con for me. I know a loop requires maintenance, but I was hoping to keep it to a minimum. Do you know around how often I'd need to top off if I'm using PETG?     As for the adapter, if I understood correctly, the adapter DOES act as a fitting. So an adapter on one end and a fitting on the other."
watercooling,3czj87,Kautkto,1 point,Sun Jul 12 17:28:06 2015 UTC,"The Enthoo Luxe has two positions for reservoirs.  One is at the rear of the case where the hex grill is, the other being a mounting plate that comes with the case that gets attached to the bay drive and hard drive cage.  I personally don't like horizontal reservoirs.  Often they are hard to fill all the way making it look kinda lame being 2/3 full.  Also you'd need to probably drill holes into the psu cover in order to mount the res securely.  Its not going to be a weekly or monthly thing, but you just have to keep in mind that eventually you'll have to top off your res.  As for the angle adaptor, think of it as an extension.  So it'll be port->adaptor->fitting->tubing."
watercooling,3czj87,Kautkto,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:22:54 2015 UTC,"Ok so I did some math into this issue and here are my calculations:  According to the Phanteks site I have ""338mm minus reservoir diameter (reservoir bracket installed)""  The length of the graphics card is 10.5 in or 266.7mm.  Subtracting the two I got 71.3mm.  The res I want to get has a diameter of 60mm, so I should have  just a bit of wiggle room left.   Do you think I'm cutting this too close? I really like the look of a nice big res next to my motherboard, and this still keeps the option of a horizontal res open.      As for PETG, as long as I can have at least 6 months before I need to top it off, it sounds great to me. Also, thanks for re-explaining the adapter thing. I understand it well now, thank you!"
watercooling,3czj87,nono0044,1 point,Sun Jul 12 22:26:43 2015 UTC,"I have had petg for the past 2 months, no noticeable fluid loss."
watercooling,3czj87,nono0044,1 point,Mon Jul 13 01:01:33 2015 UTC,Awesome. I'm changing over to PETG after research and your guys' suggestions.
watercooling,3czj87,crashbash2020,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:27:12 2015 UTC,"Once the tubes have fluid in them it looks identical to acrylic anyway, although I use pastel which is a solid colour."
watercooling,3czj87,Urbannumb3r,1 point,Mon Jul 13 04:05:22 2015 UTC,"I plan on using pastel as well. I was only worried that it'd lose its shape eventually, but the fact that it's so much more malleable and tough seems like a worthwhile tradeoff."
watercooling,3czj87,nono0044,1 point,Mon Jul 13 04:12:31 2015 UTC,"You also have to remember that the reservoir doesnt just stick to the reservoir bracket.  It needs to be attached by these clips taking away around 1cm of space of that gap.  If you really like the horizontal look, then go for it."
watercooling,3czj87,nono0044,1 point,Mon Jul 13 01:05:12 2015 UTC,"The res mounting thing was something that I was particularly worried about. But according to my math, even if those clips are like 8 or 9mm I should barely have enough room. It's good to know that I have the option of mounting it vertically or horizontally though. Because you seem very experienced, do you see any incompatibilities in my loop?"
watercooling,3czj87,Urbannumb3r,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:29:12 2015 UTC,"I was in the same boat as you.  I thought there'd be enough space but ended up having to mod the bracket, and even then the res is just touching my cards.  As for the parts themselves, looks good to me.  Any thoughts as to what fans you'll be using?"
watercooling,3czj87,Urbannumb3r,1 point,Mon Jul 13 04:13:25 2015 UTC,"I actually wouldn't mind having to drill a couple of holes to mount the res vertically/horizontally. But I'm still hoping they'll fit/look good mounted natively. As for fans, I heard Noctua fans are good, but I'm not sure of the specific ones I should get. I need fans for either side of my radiator, right?"
watercooling,3cy6ur,Elder_John,1 point,Sat Jul 11 21:11:18 2015 UTC,Link to GPU  Link to Block i would like to order  Are they compatable?
watercooling,3cy6ur,specikk,1 point,Sat Jul 11 21:19:11 2015 UTC,"I would highly recommend you use EKWB's Cooling Configurator tool to choose the exact model graphics card you are purchasing.   The tool will then tell you exactly what cooling blocks are compatible with it: http://configurator.ekwb.com/.  At a high level, the 970 blocks are not compatible with a 980 card."

watercooling,3cz5qg,saintartsflow,1 point,Sun Jul 12 02:43:13 2015 UTC,"In general, loop order doesn't make that much of a difference as long  as your reservoir is above and is followed by your pump. Based on your diagrams, I'm assuming you have a reservoir / pump combo.   That being said, I personally prefer a loop where heated water goes into the radiator from gpu/cpu blocks, then goes out to reservoir after being cooled by radiators. I'd either go for #2 or #4. But again, the order won't make much difference in your loop temps."

watercooling,3cygbo,hdshatter,1 point,Sat Jul 11 22:35:48 2015 UTC,"OD only really matters with compression fittings. If you're using barb fittings, zip ties to hold the tubing in place will expand to any OD. As for coolant, just distilled water is fine and cheap. Add a biocide and you're set."

watercooling,3cygbo,LOLCANADA,1 point,Sun Jul 12 03:34:55 2015 UTC,I'm afraid I can't help you with that since I've only ever used compression fittings.  I'd check Performance PCs or something to look around and see what you like.
watercooling,3cygbo,sikarra,1 point,Sun Jul 12 03:51:46 2015 UTC,"I'm using automotive band hose clamps, which work really really well other than being a bit tricky to install (Get the tool, it helps a ton). Some liquid cooling guys will sell you ones with a nicer finish for a lot more, but I'm using flat black hose anyway so it works.  Screw clamps are also pretty solid though they're often hard to install in tight spots since you need to get a screwdriver on the side.  Avoid the plastic clips. They don't compress the hose well and are a pain to work with."
watercooling,3cxmnv,colossalwaffles,1 point,Sat Jul 11 18:15:09 2015 UTC,Just something the sticks out like a sore thumb.    Use the SP fans instead of the AF ones.
watercooling,3cxmnv,nono0044,1 point,Sat Jul 11 20:27:47 2015 UTC,Yeah... Not sure what I was thinking using 2 different ones. Must have been my morning brain. Thanks.
watercooling,3cxmnv,sikarra,1 point,Sat Jul 11 20:37:09 2015 UTC,"Single rad on a CPU + dual GPU loop would be cutting it close. General advice I've seen here is 1+<num devices> radiator fan slots, so your proposed setup isn't that far out.  Black ice L-series rads are the ""lite"" series. Basically you don't get multiple ports and just a matte black finish instead of their fancier stuff. If the layout works for you then they're fine. rad brands don't matter much, look more at size for your application.  The case you picked doesn't seem particularly ideal for a liquid setup. I didn't see any multi-fan spots on the case so I'm not sure what your mounting plans are for the rads. If you're going to invest that kind of cash into a case, it might be more ideal to go for something that was designed with liquid in mind."
watercooling,3cxmnv,Boy1998,1 point,Sat Jul 11 20:43:05 2015 UTC,"Caselabs cases are actually designed with liquid cooling in mind. The mounting for the fans are in the custom options. There's room for 120.3 mount on the top with a drop in mount, and a 120.2/140.2 in the front.   To be honest, I haven't thought about the layout much, so I'll have to consider that. Thanks for letting me know."
watercooling,3cxmnv,specikk,1 point,Sat Jul 11 20:55:17 2015 UTC,"A few things.   If you're going for a push pull setup, don't. They're useless performance-wise. If you're getting it just for looks, feel free to get it. Check Dazmode's YouTube channel. It doesn't really matter which radiator you get. The differences are minimal compared to each other once you get enough rad space. Again, check Dazmode for this. Fittings are fittings. Bitspower are used a lot though. Corsair fans are considered middle tier. They perform well and have different colours, but they make more noise than some of the other fans. You'll have to read more into this. That amount of rads is good. If you could, maybe try squeezing another 360 rad instead of 280. If you overclock everything, it could get a bit hot.   You didn't include this in the list, but get your stuff from Dazmode. He's the only Canadian who sells stuff, unless you count the limited selection from NCIX. People say he provides good customer service if you check some forums out. If you order for PerformancePCs, you may have to pay duties when importing, and some of their customer support employees aren't great."
watercooling,3cx3e3,xhantus404,2,Sat Jul 11 15:23:14 2015 UTC,"I would recommend you get a proper fan controller, even if it's just an Aquaero LT. You don't want to burn out the electronics of the pump due to overloading the fan header. You can plug your XT into the Aquaero LT via Aquabus and control everything from the Aquaero."
watercooling,3cx3e3,specikk,1 point,Sun Jul 12 00:29:11 2015 UTC,"Thanks, that seems to be fairly easy too!  Ordered the LT along with the connector cable and will make that happen next weekend."

watercooling,3cwsyc,Kautkto,1 point,Sun Jul 12 00:49:26 2015 UTC,Should be fine. The 50x will be better if you still have concerns. You may want to consider a shoggy sandwich to help cut down on noise.

watercooling,3cvx87,Pack0ff,1 point,Sat Jul 11 05:39:56 2015 UTC,Honestly I'd just sell the 280X and buy a newer card if your budget allows for it. They have full cover blocks for both now if I'm not mistaken. Have you checked EKs site for a block for the 280X? If you can aim for a 980TI since that card came out there really isn't much reason to buy a 980 because it's price isn't worth it. Unless they dropped it ready which I couldn't tell you about because I'm not up to date on pricing lately. If you're right or want to stay on a budget you can buy a used card for cheaper than retail.
watercooling,3cvx87,unhappyemo,1 point,Sat Jul 11 06:13:40 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I'm now leaning more towards selling the 280x, ek had blocks for it but they're out of stock and no longer make them. Thanks. I'll probably look into the newer ones, a 980TI is a above my budget. So I'll most likely choose between a 390, 980, or possibly a 290x."
watercooling,3cvx87,Boy1998,1 point,Sat Jul 11 06:24:51 2015 UTC,390 is supposedly the new best value card now since it beats the 970. I'd say go for that. Freesync is cheaper too if you're into that.

watercooling,3crzuo,PC_Builder12,2,Fri Jul 10 16:17:58 2015 UTC,"How do the front fans pull in hot air? They get fresh air from the vents along the sides of the case and behind the door.  You can either make the air go from top to bottom, or bottom to top. Make the back fan, and the top radiators exhaust and the front 3 intakes and it will get better flow.  The static heatsinks on the north and south bridge of that board, which I used to have haha, needs airflow too, don't forget."
watercooling,3crzuo,liquidcooledpotato,0,Fri Jul 10 16:22:52 2015 UTC,Don't you see the radiator in the frond behind the pump ? That's where the hot air comes from.
watercooling,3crzuo,ktmfinx,2,Fri Jul 10 16:24:38 2015 UTC,"I know that, I'm talking about THAT radiator getting COOL air from outside of the case. And combining that, with the fan above it, making a strong air flow from front to back, would be good for your other components."
watercooling,3crzuo,antiproton,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:34:16 2015 UTC,Okay so I should put the fans behind the radiator and put them in intake?
watercooling,3crzuo,kevzhu,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:45:21 2015 UTC,"Ideally, you should have all fans as intake except the one at the rear of the case, which should be exhaust.  You want positive air pressure in your case (helps with dust), and that way, you are always bringing in cooler air from outside the case through the rads and then pumping that hot air outside the case via your rear fan, where natural convection will assist."
watercooling,3crzuo,pwlocke13,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:48:06 2015 UTC,"Yes that's what I've been doing with air cooling, but since the heat is not located at the same places, I dunno.. I could give it a try."
watercooling,3crzuo,iconic2125,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:50:23 2015 UTC,"That single exhaust isn't enough, air will be forced where that case wasn't designed to be an exhaust, which is why I recommended what I did.. I've both had this case and motherboard as well.  Ideally, yes, but after looking at that setup, and recalling that my IR thermometer said those static heatsinks get really hot and need moving air, I'd say one exhaust isn't enough and pumping some warm air through the top rads won't cause a noticeable rise in temps."

Considering 2 mcp35x's(I believe ddc, not sure if pwm though? mentions vdc?) vs 2 mcp655's(I believe d5 pwm?)

Copper blocks will tarnish over time, but that does not affect performance, it just makes them ugly on the inside. You can boil them in vinegar if you want to make them shine again.

I have an XRES Pump/Res combo that I was going to mount on my front 360 radiator using the EK 120mm fan mount. When the mount is attached to the combo, it protrudes out far enough where the video card cannot fit. By removing the fan mount, I'm able to screw one side of the base into the radiators screw points, but the base isn't long enough to reach the other side so I can screw it in. I used a zip tie on the other side to secure it.  My question is, do you guys know of any thin pieces of metal with holes where I can screw the base of the combo into, then screw that into the points on the radiator?

watercooling,3cpfwn,drolicheck,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:43:54 2015 UTC,"Can't give advice on the parts, since I'm new to this also, however I can say you should be able to place a fan controller behind the motherboard somewhere. They are normally not that large and will fit, you can just get some double sided adhesive and place it wherever is best for you."
watercooling,3cpfwn,cvance10,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:12:54 2015 UTC,I've used the Phanteks PWM hub before with success.  If you can control your fans via your motherboard then it works great.  Especially if you can create your own curve.  It hooks up to a PWM(4-pin) motherboard controller but works with Non-PWM(3-pin) fans.   You also may want to listen to the Corsair SP before you by them.  I find them way to loud and can only recommend the Quiet Edition ones.  Personally I think most fans over 1600 RPM to be too distracting.  I like a max of 1200 RPM.  You should know that fan controllers can not adjust the RPM's through the entire range.  My Corsair SP's(120) could be reduced to around 1700 RPM and at that level they had a very harsh sound.
watercooling,3cpfwn,endoughy,0,Thu Jul 9 20:21:10 2015 UTC,"There is literally only enough space behind the Mobo for a 2.5 inch drive, not a full 5.25 inch bay fan controller."

watercooling,3cpfwn,endoughy,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:06:13 2015 UTC,It comes with three 4 pin fan extensions and is very slim you should be able to squeeze it in. Expensive though. NZXT Grid+ is a cheaper option

If I were you I would get 4-6 45's and 2-4 90's.  Iv'e used those hose clamps and they work fine, but compression fittings are much easier to use in tight places.  I also have a Black Ice Nemesis (360) and it has much more restriction than other similar radiators. With two you may want to look for a pump that is higher pressure.  The D5 will probably be fine, but the DDC (18W) have better head pressure for high restriction loops.  The D5 can move quicker but is actually not as strong dealing with lots of blocks and tight bends."
watercooling,3cpfwn,Boy1998,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:12:32 2015 UTC,"I've got like 4 45s and 3 90s in my cart right now.  I was only going to get 2 if I needed a 2nd one. Also, it's a 420mm rad and not a 360mm since my case can support a 420mm rad.  at most I'd only have 2 blocks and the rad to go through. Along with that There would be 4 90 degree fittings, 1 45 fitting, and 3 straight fittings. I need to change my cart a bit. Lol  I am looking into the DDC pump, but are there any you'd recommend?"

watercooling,3cpfwn,itguyy,1 point,Fri Jul 10 12:24:02 2015 UTC,"Get this. This will help when you have to drain your loop for maintenance every 6-8 months. Put it as low as you can put it so gravity will do the work for you. Keep it closed until you need to drain. Then attach a piece of tubing and direct it into a bucket, and open the valve to let it flow out.  The pump is strong enough. Any D5 pump you see are just rebrands with some features added, so it doesn't matter which you get.  1 rad is enough. If you want it more silent then you can add the other one too, but it isn't needed.  Stick this on the cable management side of the case. Just attach it with some velcro. Remember to get PWM fans.  Here and here are some setup guides. It should be fairly simple for the most part."

Roughly how many meters could one good quality pump actually pump water     Does the tubing its self actually cool? For instance if I had a coil around a cup holder built into the desk would it be enough to keep a drink cool?    The whole system would be pretty much solidly attached to a wall  I've seen stuff about having to rotate your rig to help fill it with coolant for the first time   Would a high enough pressure pump be enough to get around this?

watercooling,3cmnne,CaptainGreezy,2,Thu Jul 9 02:25:14 2015 UTC,"Your flow rates through each component will not be that great since you're splitting it 3 ways.  If you really want to do a parallel loop, I'd recommend putting another pump in parallel with your pump there."
watercooling,3cmnne,xNPi,1 point,Thu Jul 9 03:59:52 2015 UTC,Maybe just parallel through the GPUs and leave the rest in series?
watercooling,3cmnne,xNPi,2,Thu Jul 9 04:32:46 2015 UTC,"That's a typical setup, which is perfectly fine. I thought your intentions were to go atypical though."
watercooling,3cmnne,tengen,2,Thu Jul 9 05:00:02 2015 UTC,You are correct to think that just exploring options.  In the last hour I learned up on rigid tubing and am definitely going to do that so I should probably not over complicate it and save myself a few tubes to bend and use a few less fittings.
watercooling,3cmnne,sailorbob134280,2,Thu Jul 9 05:15:43 2015 UTC,"A series ought to perform better as the 35x has better pressure but worse flow.  The chipset and ram blocks will contribute neglible heat, so there's no reason to split them off into parallel section. It adds unnecessary clutter imo and will affect the performance of the CPU somewhat."
watercooling,3cmnne,sailorbob134280,1 point,Thu Jul 9 04:45:03 2015 UTC,"The ram and chipset werent on their own section, rather each was on the output of a GPU before rejoining the series, with the CPU by itself on a third section.  The chipset and ram block placement is actually quite convenient for that but rejoining everything into the upper radiator is the tricky part.    As much as I do like making it more complicated than necessary I probably will just go with the single loop and maybe just parallel the GPUs"
watercooling,3cmnne,Owltruism,1 point,Thu Jul 9 05:12:49 2015 UTC,"Woah, what's up with the CPU block in the parallel diagram? Looks like you have two inputs and no output. Or am I just stupid and not seeing it right?"
watercooling,3cmnne,sailorbob134280,1 point,Thu Jul 9 06:20:53 2015 UTC,"No, the CPU block is just 1-in-1-out.  It's the GPU blocks that are each 1-in-2-out.  Basically using that inlet straight through the 2 GPU blocks a 1-in-3-out manifold."
watercooling,3cmnne,DJ-VELOCIRAPTOR,2,Thu Jul 9 06:26:26 2015 UTC,What I was referring to is the flow direction. It flows into the CPU block from the main line (after splitting off from the GPUs) but one of the GPU lines also runs into the CPU block (after the chipset). How does that work?
watercooling,3cmnne,erickliban,1 point,Thu Jul 9 07:53:18 2015 UTC,I was wondering exactly the same. I can't wrap my head around it.

watercooling,3clqm7,tcollier91,1 point,Wed Jul 8 23:39:57 2015 UTC,Enthoo luxe here. Use the top rad as exhause and the front as intake. You'll get plenty of air and if you're water cooling everything it ought to be fine.
watercooling,3clqm7,AspenGrey,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:11:31 2015 UTC,"I have an Enthoo Luxe and am setting up a loop as well. I'm going to have a 360mm rad up top exhuasting air, a 240mm rad on the bottom bringing air in, two 120mm fans on the front to help bring more air in and a single 140mm on the rear for exhaust.  It's a tight fit, but you can get away with a 30mm radiator on the bottom with regular fans on it and still be able to fit a pump. It's a bit tricky though.  Do you plan to use any of the hard drive bays? Because putting a radiator in the front means you have to remove both cages."
watercooling,3clqm7,Cartman372,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:58:03 2015 UTC,I have 2 ssds so I don't need the hdd cages. So the pump as gonna go on the floor where the hdd cages were. So with that I am not sure where a bottom radiator could fit.
watercooling,3clqm7,Cartman372,2,Thu Jul 9 20:32:35 2015 UTC,"Well with our case I believe it's a 240 on the front or a 240 on the bottom, not both. Since you have no use for the hard drive cages, I'd just mount a 240x30 on the front, get an EK pump bracket and mount the pump on the back of the radiator.   If you have a DDC or DCP pump, you can just use the EK-UNI Pump Holder Link  If you have a D5 pump, you'll need that pump holder in addition to the UK-UNI Holder D5 V3 Link  Here's what the whole contraption looks like mounted to my 240mmx30mm radiator with fans and an EK D5 pump. This is mounted for the radiator on the bottom, all you'd have to do is rotate the mount to fit your specific needs. http://i.imgur.com/mpFkvPL.jpg"
watercooling,3clicb,dj_da,2,Wed Jul 8 21:01:49 2015 UTC,"I've got a couple of AQ D5 pumps connected via USB and Aquabus.  I recall having to set each pump (and my flow sensor) to separate Aquabus channels in Aquasuite, in order to be able to control each one on the Aquaero.  I'm not sure if this remains relevant for the Aquastreams. Sorry I can't point to the exact section in Aquasuite as I don't have it running (new Windows 10 install) and I'm recrimping all my usb connections to make shorter cables. There's an Aquaero club on overclock.net and folks are generally very helpful, what with the Aquaero being a total beast of a controller with pretty poor documentation. Your other option is to drive the pumps right off the fan channels, but that kinda defeats the purpose of having fancy usb pumps and controllers :)"
watercooling,3clicb,turbo_customs,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:54:34 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the info on overclock.net I will check it out.  As for the Aquastreams, I have one connected to Aquabus in Low and it gets recognized just fine, I plug other one into High and get nothing. I did read somewhere however that if I had a 4pin Y splitter(which I dont) I could plug both Aquastreams into High and it should recognize them. I was just hoping to get around that as finding a female to female Y splitter has been surprisingly difficult."
watercooling,3clicb,turbo_customs,2,Wed Jul 8 22:11:44 2015 UTC,Aquabus low is old tech and doesn't work for the newer kit that uses Aquabus.  I have multiple Y  splitter connected together to get three Aquabus devices connected to high.  I bought them directly from AQ
watercooling,3cl1dc,lil_ecky,2,Wed Jul 8 19:05:08 2015 UTC,"Well I know this probably isn't exactly what you want to hear, but you'll likely want more radiator space to adequately cool a CPU and GPU. For example I have a thick triple rad on my CPU alone. I know it's overkill but it's overclocked to 4.65 Ghz and temps are 30 at idle and at 100% stress it peaks 90. It's also silent at both. Anyways for the pump, I don't really know don't go based off me but I'd say go for either a D5 or DDC not a little one just for budget. Especially with all those components"
watercooling,3cl1dc,mpickering321,2,Wed Jul 8 19:16:10 2015 UTC,OP I'd listen to this guy. I don't have any experience with custom loops but just with my AIO cooler that had a 240mm radiator it barely did the job of keeping my OC'd CPU cool so trying to cool both a CPU and GPU off 240 mm of radiator doesn't seem very realistic.
watercooling,3cl1dc,dandruski,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:00:10 2015 UTC,"What CPU? My 3570k at 4.8ghz on a 360mm alphacool ST30 doesn't peak nearly that high, around 65C."
watercooling,3cl1dc,herminzerah,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:17:13 2015 UTC,"It's the i5 4670k I know it's really hot but that's at peak. I'm running a hackintosh and stressed it with the yes command one thread on each core. It's a 100% load stress test, during any other load I've never seen it past 60-70. I should probably tone it down and I think it may be a poor overclocker but if it does I'd rather have an i7 anyways just for the binning. I think it's actually really funny, when I run the test it's instantly up to 80-90 then when I stop it, it's also instantly back down to 26-30. I also have 3 noiseblocker pl2s at either 5v (or 7 can't remember) on the rad"

watercooling,3cl1dc,tengen,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:34:17 2015 UTC,"Nah, I'm greatful for the input, but I'm aware I'm kind of chancing it with the 240mm, but it's actually a car radiator, and basically, long story short, it's super ghetto and part of a college project. But for that setup, do you think either pump would be enough?"
watercooling,3cl1dc,tengen,2,Wed Jul 8 20:33:24 2015 UTC,"Be careful about using car radiators, car radiators use aluminum cores, which will wreck everything else in your loop.   The first pump link looks like a Liang DDC 3.1 (aka MCP350) pump, which is decent but has historically higher failure rates; it's gone through a couple revisions before being replaced by DDC 3.2 (355)."

watercooling,3cl0ie,mpickering321,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:19:37 2015 UTC,"Oh thats true. I dont think its a hybrid. Its a Corsair cs450m. Ill do some research into it. Thankfully its a gold rated pc, so I dont think I will have to worry too much about lots of excess heat. Even still though its always a concern. Maybe I could also put a fan with better static pressure in the PSU as well."
watercooling,3cl0ie,mpickering321,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:55:17 2015 UTC,Ok. So what are you cooling in your loop. Another idea I just had was maybe put a more powerful fan on the other side of the radiator and then make the rad kinda push pull?
watercooling,3cl0ie,mpickering321,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:59:21 2015 UTC,The only thing in the loop will likely be the cpu unless I can find a ram block. Its a really simple setup because I am building a server. The cpu is a Pentium g3258 so I may be overclocking a smidge here shortly. Even with the addition of the ram I am doubtful I will need more than a singe 140x60mm rad. I will probably have room for another fan though so that might not be a bad idea. I can probably just keep them on their lowest operating setting for the most part as well.
watercooling,3cl0ie,mpickering321,2,Wed Jul 8 20:11:29 2015 UTC,"Are you sure you want the ram block? I think the money could be better used. Ram realistically doesn't even need heat sinks even with a mild overclock. It's more for aesthetics, but what can I say, that's why I even built my loop haha. Edit: wow just looked at the CPU, you'll be plenty fine with that rad and could probably get away with a pretty nice OC actually"

watercooling,3cjg6c,yorishimo,2,Wed Jul 8 11:33:22 2015 UTC,"So basically the first link is just for the waterblock (thats used in the second link's kit).  So you would still need to source your own tubing, fittings, pump, reservoir, fans, and coolant to finish the loop.  The second link is basically a package that has the EK block (from the first link) pre-installed on the card with everything you need to create a loop already bundled with the card.   It's up to you which route you go.  With just getting the block, you have more choice over what reservoir and other parts you use.  With the second option, you have less headache of trying to put a parts list together yourself.

Some have had issues with the hardlock collars cracking.  You have to be very accurate with your bends so there is no lateral stress on the fittings.  I'm hanging a full reservoir off a fitting and have had no issues so far.  I went through about 5M of tubing to get about 2M of perfect bends. Monsoon moved from acrylic to PETG collars recently, so if you do go for them make sure the fittings come with PETG collars (much less prone to cracking versus acrylic)."

watercooling,3ch810,JoeyCoffeeCakes,3,Tue Jul 7 21:58:56 2015 UTC,"Really it all comes down to preference. Obviously you'll need the core components (CPU block, tubing, radiator, pump, reservoir, fittings, fluid, and optionally gpu block) but as to which components it all depends on your case and your preferences, both in terms of design and performance. For example, do you want a 5.25"" bay reservoir or a cylindrical one? Do you want a special cooling fluid or would you rather just use distilled water and some sort of biocide? A custom watercooling loop is a statement of personalization and customization, and as such you'll have to decide these things yourself. That being said, the the Liang D5 is the classic recommendation for a pump, though every major watercooling manufacturer has their own spin on it, whether it be a custom enclosure/top or just a label. Some generally good brands are EK, Koolance, XSPC, Phobya, Swiftech, Alphacool, Primochill,  and Bitspower, though these are by no means the only ones.  Also I guess you know this, but hardline tubing requires a good bit more work. You have to use a heat gun to bend the tubes if you choose not to use fittings for every bend, and it requires a lot more precision. I'm not trying to discourage you from it but just know that it means more effort compared to soft tubing, and that it's harder to service or to swap out parts (though it does look sexy as hell)."

watercooling,3cf9kd,nono0044,3,Tue Jul 7 15:33:18 2015 UTC,"Well theres two main groups of acrylic.  Theres the primochill tubing, which will fit only in the primochill fittings due to their unique dimentions.  But if you get primichill fittings, you can use their PETG tubing.  Fittings are okay, come in lots of colours, not as classy or refined feeling as the BP ones.  They work by having an o-ring being compressed by the compression collar around the tubing.  Some say this isn't as secure, but I have them and have not had any problems with them.  Then there are EK and Bitspower.  They offer tubing in either 12mm OD or 16mm OD, and the respective fittings for them.  They only offer acrylic tubing, but you could always check if a third party (like McMaster Carr) offers PETG tubing in the correct dimensions.  EK offeres 5 colours, while BP offers 4.  BP are more expensive but feel the most robust out of the three main brands.  Both the EK and BP fittings function by having an o-ring in the actual fitting that the tubing has to pass through when being put into the fitting, and an o-ring that gets compressed in same fasion as the primochill ones.  Double o-ring offers more grip on the tubing, preventing tubing from being pulled out from fittings.  One thing to note though, if you aren't planning to bend the tubing, BP offers a lot of angle/rotary adapters with fittings so you can create turns with fittings as opposed to with bending the tubing.  TL;DR:  Primochill has their own gear.  Colourful and affordable, but not as robust.  EK and BP have their own gear. Less colours, more dollars (for BP).  More robust.  Go BP if you don't want to do bends."

watercooling,3cf9kd,nono0044,1 point,Wed Jul 8 00:43:10 2015 UTC,How about the older ghost fittings?  You can always try the Monsoons though.
watercooling,3cf9kd,Oversidee,1 point,Wed Jul 8 01:18:42 2015 UTC,Is it ok to use 3/8 -  5/8 fittings on 7/16 - 5/8 tubing or is it too loose? I have the fittings already but tubing is all out of stock :/
watercooling,3cf9kd,sikarra,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:06:00 2015 UTC,"It might work on barb fittings if use good clamps, but you should really just find someone who has the right size in stock if you can.   I ran a loop with mixed sized fittings for a while and the incorrect ones were always finnicky and a constant leak risk when the case was moved or jostled. They also had a tendency to bleed air into the loop when the pump was on full bore."
watercooling,3cf9kd,Oversidee,2,Tue Jul 7 22:23:11 2015 UTC,Thanks for your input. I'm building my loop with compression fittings and dual 980 ti so I probably shouldn't take the risk...
watercooling,3cf9kd,StoleOne,1 point,Wed Jul 8 00:08:42 2015 UTC,Should I wait for the skylake architecture to build a new pc? Is it worth it to use water cooling? Priced it out to about $1000-1500 to water cool a build. I would enjoy a whisper quiet build but not sure it is worth $1000. The cool factor is there though. What are some examples of cool things you can do if you have a water cooled pc that are not based on aesthetics.
watercooling,3cf9kd,AussieGunz,2,Wed Jul 8 20:18:26 2015 UTC,"I would question whether a custom loop is right for you, based on that...  Skylake will be personal preference, we don't have all the details yet.   Worth is a subjective point. And changes if you are basing it on performance, personal-interest or.....the cool factor."
watercooling,3cf9kd,StoleOne,2,Thu Jul 9 01:16:36 2015 UTC,Thanks for the response.
watercooling,3cf9kd,sub_lyme,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:37:58 2015 UTC,I am wondering what the purpose is for this.  Do I need it to mount fans on to the radiator? Does it help channel the airflow strictly through the fan? I am just not sure if it is a necessary part or not.
watercooling,3cf9kd,AussieGunz,2,Wed Jul 8 20:28:42 2015 UTC,The Single 120mm Radiator Fan Template is a plastic template that is used for laying out single 120mm mount and blow holes. This highly durable plastic template can be used over and over again and is based on the popular radiator spacing.  It is for laying out holes...it's a template. You don't need it for any of those reasons. If you aren't modding a case then you definitely don't need this.
watercooling,3cfhz2,larainzlo07,3,Tue Jul 7 14:42:54 2015 UTC,It's most likely the micro air bubbles in the loop. They will lighten the color and once they work their way out the coolant will look like it is supposed too.
watercooling,3cfhz2,niceandcreamy,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:55:15 2015 UTC,I remember a video of this kid that was circulating around here that was dry running his pump and his red coolant turned pink due to all the air bubbles. Maybe you had some air bubbles that lightened the color a bit.
watercooling,3cg6yd,stereosteam,2,Tue Jul 7 17:40:49 2015 UTC,"I've used all ek parts in my loop except the acrylic tube which was monsoon. No problems with them and they are good quality fittings.  With fittings vs bends, I think it looks much cleaner with bends and there is less points at which you can have failures. It's also a lot cheaper, although bending takes a while longer."
watercooling,3cg6yd,Dizz_ee,2,Tue Jul 7 20:53:51 2015 UTC,I just put in a bunch of rotary fittings in and they seem pretty solid. The nice thing about fittings is you still get the flex of the tube to move stuff around and out of the way if needed. In my case I had a temp sensor start leaking after a few weeks and I was able to pull the res out far enough to repair it without draining the loop.
watercooling,3cg6yd,sikarra,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:34:20 2015 UTC,I haven't heard anything spectacular in ek or primochill. So I can't answer that. But basically  for 90 degree fittings vs bends   Fittings will be pricier but will look better aesthetically (personal opinion) and it will be easier since you just need straight runs for your acrylic tubing.
watercooling,3cg6yd,Panduhsaur,1 point,Tue Jul 7 19:42:53 2015 UTC,A lot pricier and as you say it's a taste thing. Personally I prefer the look of a good 90 degree bend to having tons of fittings.
watercooling,3cg6yd,NeedsMoreSpaceships,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:24:09 2015 UTC,"I think for me. My preference comes from sucking at bending. I tried doing the 90 degree bends.

watercooling,3cg6yd,niceandcreamy,1 point,Wed Jul 8 23:15:20 2015 UTC,"I happen to like how primochill fittings look. But my build also has the 90 degree fittings from EK (because the bitspower ones are frankly kinda gross looking imo), and while I haven't had any leaks yet, they do rotate very loosely.  I try to minimize the amount of O rings in my system, so I bent what I could, but if the run just seemed too difficult, I just used a fitting."
watercooling,3cfyzg,MMKH,2,Tue Jul 7 16:46:08 2015 UTC,"Doesn't really matter, do what you think looks best. If you put the radiator at the top you can just flip the fans so they'll either pull air down or push air out.

watercooling,3cbw5v,PromileSuccessor,7,Mon Jul 6 18:33:48 2015 UTC,One of the main advantages of having a reservoir is to make filling your loop much easier.
watercooling,3cbw5v,phigo50,6,Mon Jul 6 18:38:52 2015 UTC,The reservoir's main purpose IMO is to protect your pump. It takes a very long time to work out all the air bubbles in your loop - I see the water level in my res drop even weeks after initial filling. Running air through your pump will damage/destroy it - so it's practical to have a column of water above it at all times. The heat dissipation benefits of a res are negligible.
watercooling,3cbw5v,ChampagnePOWPOW,2,Mon Jul 6 18:46:49 2015 UTC,I wasn't talking about reservoirs dissipating heat. I meant that a larger res will cause the temps to be lower initially since the heat producing elements have to heat up more water. Sorry if I expression was unclear.  I know that the pump needs water/fluid at all times. I was just asking because I hate big cases and I want to eliminate/minimize the space of a res.
watercooling,3cbw5v,ICanHazTehCookie,1 point,Mon Jul 6 19:05:56 2015 UTC,"Using bigger reservoirs is mainly for aesthetics and to making filling the loop easier, their effect on how long it takes the coolant to reach an equilibrium temperature is probably negligible.  I'm not really sure how you'd fill a loop that has no res. You could look into micro reservoirs."
watercooling,3cbw5v,Karavusk,1 point,Mon Jul 6 19:21:06 2015 UTC,I was thinking you could use those fittings that you can remove and put in without creating air bubbles. I forgot how they are called. You would need one that attaches to a fitting with three holes. Two of the openings will be connected to the tubing that is the inlet for the pump and the third will be connected to a long tubing that holds the water ( that would be your temporary res). After all the air is out you simply remove the temporary res.
watercooling,3cbw5v,doprahwinfreyIII,2,Mon Jul 6 19:32:17 2015 UTC,yes there were very few people who didnt use a res a long time ago. You can use a fitting but have fun with air bubbles...
watercooling,3cbw5v,conet,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:09:29 2015 UTC,They're called quick connect or quick disconnect fittings.
watercooling,3cbw5v,niceandcreamy,1 point,Tue Jul 7 00:41:24 2015 UTC,"There would be an initial benefit of more water like you say, but steady-state is the main concern, since the computer will live most of the time at that temperature; all things being equal, more water won't do anything in steady state.  As for lack of res, some people use t-lines, which I think is just a t-fitting somewhere in the loop to add water (in a place where during bleeding, water will always be in the pump). Bleeding is a huge pain but you do save space."
watercooling,3cbw5v,lol_alex,3,Mon Jul 6 19:39:19 2015 UTC,"Let me tell you from personal experience you'll want a reservoir. Even if it's one of those micro ones they will help you will filling, bleeding, and draining. I had a no res loop that I had to fill through my GPU's while my case was upside down."
watercooling,3cbw5v,alphanimal,1 point,Mon Jul 6 23:23:48 2015 UTC,"Aside from making the system easier to fill and get out air bubbles, there is a significant volume expansion going on when the water heats up.   Since water is incompressible, a completely closed loop with no air in it would quickly build up massive amounts of pressure, which nothing in the system is designed for (seals, fittings, radiators). Almost every fluid-based system in technology has an expansion chamber (the heating system in your house, the cooling system in your car's engine) to compensate for volume expansion. Some use a membrane to separate fluid and water, some are just open-end with a very small hole, and some have a blow-off valve for when the pressure gets too high (car)"
watercooling,3cbw5v,lol_alex,1 point,Tue Jul 7 07:59:33 2015 UTC,exactly. Some air in the loop is actually important to compensate pressure differences. it just should stay on top and not be pumped through the loop.
watercooling,3cbw5v,lol_alex,1 point,Tue Jul 7 12:21:06 2015 UTC,Yes this thread turned out to be more intersting than I thought. :)
watercooling,3cbw5v,tengen,1 point,Tue Jul 7 13:05:14 2015 UTC,I made some calculation. Asuming you loop has 1.2liters of water at 20°C. At 100°C it will expand by ~4%. I think that is a little too much even for flexible tubing. So I will need a buffer.  If my calculations are right I will need for this szenario 1.7cm high air pocket in my tube reservoir. I have the EK D5 X-RES TOP 140. Does anyone know where I can get an acrylic tube with the right threads on them that is 1.5cm to 2cm. By that I mean the height of the smooth unthreadened part of it.
watercooling,3cbw5v,tengen,1 point,Tue Jul 7 13:03:43 2015 UTC,"You will need a buffer for much more than that. There is some evaporation, probably even dissipation through the tubes, and you really want some safety in this.  In addition, the smaller the air pocket, the bigger the relative pressure change. A 5% change in volume will only increase the pressure by 5%, halving the volume will double the pressure. You do not want to double the pressure.  EDIT The above is true for a closed loop. I do not recommend a closed loop anyway. There should be a small hole, preferably in the highest place of the res, to allow for the loop volume to expand and contract without static pressure at all."
watercooling,3cbw5v,lol_alex,1 point,Tue Jul 7 13:14:42 2015 UTC,"Is there a membrane that lets air go in and out but not water out?  Also a decrease in water over time is something I check every two or three months. If the water level decreased I open it up, let pressure equalize and fill some water in.  I find the idea of an open res quite scary."
watercooling,3cbw5v,tengen,2,Tue Jul 7 14:44:18 2015 UTC,"Yes it's called Goretex. I am not kidding you. My company used to punch little holes in the axle bellows of cars so condensate could get out.

I'm sure you could find some guides on how to do so, but there are obvious issues with new size tubing not working with the existing fittings, pump refilling, etc.  If you don't want to go the easy way and slap an AIO on it, I would wholeheartedly suggest using a universal block. AFAIK there are no companies that sell the reference Titan cooler precut a la that one Japanese company.

watercooling,3ccu6v,thedesigner2011,1 point,Thu Jul 9 12:09:45 2015 UTC,"Hmm, It could definitely work. However, it looks like you'll have to remove the GeForce LEDs and take some strict measurements of where to cut, how much to cut based on the thermosphere size, and the best tool to get a clean cut. I would probably do this prior to committing to a thermosphere because it looks like a very hefty cut right in the middle of your reference 980ti.

Every CPU is different so I really wouldn't compare your result to anyone else, even if they have the same chip as you.   The only other thing I will say is that it'll take a few days (maybe even a week or longer) for your loop to stabilize and push all the micro air bubbles out. Little air bubbles can also be stuck in places like your CPU block. Once those get pushed out, it's possible your temps may drop by a few degrees.   What are you using to measure CPU core temperatures?"

watercooling,3cakcz,specikk,2,Mon Jul 6 12:28:15 2015 UTC,"Gotcha. I would say you haven't done anything wrong.   A lot of times individual core temperatures can be misreported by the microcontroller on the motherboard. Specifically a board like the X99 has a Nuvoton microcontroller that monitors CPU temps but they are consistently incorrect when comparing the temperatures to the actual temps reported by the CPU itself. Not sure what board you have, but most have something equivalent.   I haven't used RealTemp personally. I'd recommend downloading OpenHardwareMonitor. When you open it up, compare CPU core temperatures that appear nested under your motherboard to the core temperatures listed under the CPU itself."

watercooling,3cakcz,specikk,2,Mon Jul 6 13:39:46 2015 UTC,"Fans do have an impact on cooling but not by much. The important thing to remember with fans being used on radiators is that they are different than normal case fans. Radiator fans are normally labeled ""high static pressure"" which means they can still suck/push air even when pressed up against a radiator surface.   I personally use Corsair SP120 High Performance editions for my radiators, and they work really well while not breaking the bank.  All in all though, as long as you have decent high static pressure fans, you're in the clear. Radiator configurations like push/pull (where you have fans on both sides of the radiator) have very minimal effect on temperatures and only really make sense for super thick radiators."

watercooling,3bzpai,Urbannumb3r,1 point,Mon Jul 6 15:24:18 2015 UTC,"I was planning on doing my first watercooling loop and had though about PETG tubing, but I'm reconsidering and may go with standard tubing. As long as the OD and ID are the same, could I use Hardline Compression Fittings for soft tubing and later upgrade to hard tubing?  I will want to watercool my GPU when I upgrade it and though that might be a good time to upgrade from soft tubing to hard tubing also without having to change the fittings."
watercooling,3bzpai,Nyxi26,1 point,Mon Jul 6 11:46:33 2015 UTC,"I don't think that's a good idea - hardline fittings use o-rings and light pressure to achieve a seal whereas flexible tubing is physically compressed when the fitting is screwed down. No matter which way round you do that it doesn't seem like it will work.  If easy upgrading is important then you might be better off with flexible tubing anyway; hardline is a pain to drain (although so is flexible without quick disconnects), and you'd potentially have to re-do bend to the GPU to ensure fit with the new block."
watercooling,3bzpai,Urbannumb3r,1 point,Mon Jul 6 14:30:08 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the info, I don't mind re-doing the bends, in fact I look forward to bending some tubing, though I may just stick to soft tubing or wait until I get my next GPU for the loop."
watercooling,3bzpai,specikk,1 point,Mon Jul 6 14:35:48 2015 UTC,"I just finished my first hard tubing build and I will say even having built soft tube systems in the past, it was pretty challenging. Every run has to be super precise in terms of measurements, bends and cuts.   If this is your first custom loop, I'd highly recommend sticking with soft tubing the first time around. It's way more forgiving. The cost to entry is also way lower with soft tube. For hard tube you have to buy a bending kit that includes a saw, mandrels, heat gun and a bunch of other stuff.   About the hard line compression fittings, they will not work for soft tubing.  As /u/Nyxi26 described above, it's a totally different method of compression for hard tube."
watercooling,3bzpai,Nyxi26,1 point,Mon Jul 6 14:57:43 2015 UTC,"If you definitely want hardline I think you're better off going straight to it - I did the same with my build and I'm glad I did. As long as you're patient and careful it's not too difficult, the only real downside is that you have to disassemble completely in order to upgrade. If you enjoy re-doing the bends more power to ya!"

watercooling,3bzpai,derezzed19,1 point,Mon Jul 6 14:49:14 2015 UTC,"The idea is just that you never want your pump to run dry. Having the reservoir above the pump typically addresses this. I guess you could do it differently but just make sure your pump inlet is getting water before you ever turn it on, as running a pump for watercooling dry can destroy it in a matter of seconds. So if you are running tube from a res to a rad in the top of your case then to your pump, for example, that probably wouldn't be good as the water needs to get to the pump via gravity."

watercooling,3c009e,NeedsMoreSpaceships,3,Fri Jul 3 15:25:29 2015 UTC,This needs to be wiki-ed or something.   Cleaning nickel plated copper: When cleaning nickel plated copper it is forbidden to use any aggressive chemicals (neither vinegar) or rough materials as you may damage the plating and thus void the warranty. Please note also that due to presence of dye additives and other chemicals the nickel layer may also become discolored/stained over time period. However the staining is normally reversible by simple flush and rinse. Cleaning the nickel plated copper should consists of these steps: - flush the nickel plated copper under warm water - clean the surface using wet non-abrasive cloth and rinse with clean water - polish the hardened deposits (such as algae or dirt) from the nickel plated copper if necessary.

I bought some vinegar-based cleaner, diluted some of it in distilled water, submerged the fittings and let it ""soak"" a few minutes in the sun (which may have sped up the process as one side seems affected more)  Also the rubber seal feels a bit brittle after the treatment.  So I may would have been fine if I'd just rinsed them, but I think even then it's not a good idea. Nickel seems to dissolve in acetic acid.  these are the ingredients in the cleaner I bought:   Aqua, Acetic Acid, C12-C14 (Fatty Alcohol Ethoxylate) (< 5-20 EO), Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Parfum, Citric Acid, CI 47005"

I should have checked for Nickel specifically and maybe not completely submerge the fittings. Besides, it was just three unused fittings I tested it with.  I think that vinegar will do the same thing though. the other ingredients in the cleaner are mostly harmless (surfactant, parfum, coloring). Acetic Acid is basically vinegar. Citric Acid is added mainly for the smell. I don't think that dissolves Nickel.  Did you just rinse the inside of your fittings? What kinds of fittings did you clean?"

watercooling,3by9cd,tengen,8,Fri Jul 3 04:05:27 2015 UTC,"A good pump is the most important thing, as that's the biggest and most frequent point of failure in every loop. Bad pumps just fizz out after a few months or leak.   An open loop costs $500 up. That's an expected price for a CPU + GPU loop. For two GPU that price is about right for a basic no-frills loop. Despite more surface area, 120mm-based rads have better fan options which are often cheaper, and perform better. Consider a MCP50x pump which can be had around $70. Unless you need the bling, a XSPC Raystorm will cost around $50 and will perform just as good. You need two fittings per item: pump, rad, res, CPU, GPU, GPU for 12 total.

watercooling,3bxspa,PromileSuccessor,1 point,Fri Jul 3 17:05:36 2015 UTC,Good fan choices (even though a little expensive). Though you still wont need two rads.
watercooling,3bx2s4,Shoopman,2,Thu Jul 2 21:29:58 2015 UTC,"Rads: According to Daz's videos, rad thickness and FPI don't matter too much. You can get a slim rad and only be 1-2c higher than a thick rad. Push pull doesn't matter either. Just choose push or pull unless you want it to look nice with fans. What's important is having enough rad space to cool everything. Get a 120mm rad for each part, and add another 120mm which in this case would be 360. Your 2 240mm rads are enough.  FPI: Too much is useless. It won't perform more than 1-2c better than somewhere in the middle range. It also traps dust in tight spaces which makes it hard to clean. Go for 12-17 FPI.  Fans: Noctua and Gentle Typhoon fans are considered to be one of the best available. Look for PWM fans to control the speed. I don't know much more else about them. You'll have to wait until someone else answers or if you want to look at some forums. Try Overclock.net.  Fluid: Distilled water is always the best. Just make sure you add a biocide to it like a silver kill coil which can be reused forever, or PT Nuke which needs 1-2 drops every time you need to refill your loop after maintenance. If you decide to use the silver kill coil, don't buy EK nickel plated water blocks. The nickel flakes off and you don't want that to end in your pump.  Pump: It is recommended for a variable speed pump, but since you don't care how loud it is, I'd say it's up to you if you want to spend a few extra bucks for one. Once you're at a certain flow rate, anything above won't impact performance. Just get a single D5 pump. I prefer the D5 Vario. It has a speed dial that adjusts for flow rate. If you leave it at 2 or 3 out of the 5, it'll be silent and move water. Don't get the D5 Strong. It's overkill for this.  Brands: There are some more preferred brands, but all do the job well. Alphacool is the go-to for rads. Bitspower for fittings. XSPC kinda makes everything and they're regarded as good. EK makes good blocks. It doesn't matter much. Just get something that looks nice to you and isn't overly expensive than the next alternative.  Tubing: It's all looks. Get thick or thin tubing. The only difference is the thin ones may be able to bend more easily when you insert them into fittings and won't kinks as easily. Get some compression fittings, maybe a few angles ones too, and you're good.  Air pressure: What I'd do is slow the exhaust fans as much as possible and add as many airflow fans where a rad won't be (like bottom or near the motherboard side). There's not much else you can do besides having more intake than exhaust. Just get some fan filters and pop them on. Most cases make it hard to have positive air pressure.  Guides* Well, here of course is good. For a larger community, got to overclock.net and show off your build as well. JaysTwoCents is probably the most popular video producer for this. OC3D makes some videos as well. Linus did some on them if you check his upload history. Linus is the largest general PC video maker, and Jay for specifically watercooling.  Maintenance: Change water every 6-8 months. Open your blocks up and lightly use a toothbrush to scrub them.  You said you wanted to drown out the coil whine. Isn't that caused by the cooler of the GPU? If you take it off and use a block, you can't eat any coil whine. The loudest part will either be your PSU fan, pump if it's running at full speed, or fans if they're running at full speed. Watercooling makes it easy to bring the sound down. You can achieve an almost dead silent build with it.  If someone would like to add something I missed, let me know."
watercooling,3bx2s4,Boy1998,1 point,Thu Jul 2 23:02:25 2015 UTC,"Thanks, that helped a lot. I do believe coil whine comes from the GPU PCB itself, which is why I would need to drown it out. Luckily it's not too bad and seems to be worst when I play DOTA 2 for some reason, a game I don't play that often."
watercooling,3bx2s4,TheRealLHOswald,1 point,Fri Jul 3 00:06:02 2015 UTC,"You probably won't need anything more than 2 240's or 2 280's for that setup.  No idea about FPI someone else can speak up to that.  Distilled water with a silver coil is what is recommended, especially for first timers. Much easier to work with and cheaper to boot!  Variable speed pumps are pretty much always worth it nowadays. They allow you to overcome any resistance in your loop and adjust how loud the pump is.  In terms of gpu blocks, EK is definitely the most reliable and they're really easy to install. Great customer service. Cpu block matters, but not as much as gpu block, because your gpu is pushing wayyyyyyyy more heat than even 2 of your processors."
watercooling,3bxnaq,Urbannumb3r,1 point,Fri Jul 3 00:21:51 2015 UTC,What parts are you looking at? Discrete reservoirs and pumps can be connected with anything ranging from fittings and tubing to a male-male adapter. If you want them as a cohesive single piece then you need a reservoir with a built in top for the pump of your choice. It's best to buy them as a combo directly to save cost.
watercooling,3bxnaq,VSG28,1 point,Fri Jul 3 00:39:37 2015 UTC,"I'm still searching for parts but I for sure want a tube reservoir, preferably comboed with a pump, I'll look more into combos. Though to be frank I have yet to grasp the difference between D5 pumps and DDC pumps, are they more useful in different situations or is one straight up more powerful than the other?"

watercooling,3bxnaq,VSG28,2,Fri Jul 3 01:16:41 2015 UTC,"That second link is filled with a bunch of nonsense, as are most things on LTT. A D5 has lower head pressure, but higher max flow compared to a DDC. If one is using components that add to to a mid-high liquid flow restriction (pressure drop of ~5 psi or higher) then the DDC makes more sense as the higher head pressure will help with this and give a higher overall flow rate. In simpler loops or if using components with low flow restriction then the D5 will be better performing.   There are other things also like physical footprint, noise, temperature, control options and pump heat dissipation which separate these pumps."
watercooling,3bxnaq,tengen,3,Fri Jul 3 02:31:49 2015 UTC,"Both DDC and D5 can handle any sort of typical loop, and the only real consideration is noise and footprint. From this 2011 guide which is still relevant:  http://www.overclock.net/t/1108918/what-can-my-pump-handle-a-guide/  A typical simple loop will have ~3 PSI drop, if at that; a D5 or DDC 3.2 can handle well above that at stock. There's also the newer MCP50x which gives better head still at lower GPM. Newer designs tend to emphasize better flow and less restriction, and the popular Raystorm / Alphacool rads are super low restriction. Martin tested that hard 90 degree fittings have negible pressure drop. You can really build whatever you want and throw a D5/DDC at it and be on your merry way.  I like D5 better because it makes less noise."
watercooling,3bxnaq,doprahwinfreyIII,2,Fri Jul 3 06:08:49 2015 UTC,From what I've seen and read DDC pumps also generate more heat in a much smaller foot print then a D5 pump.   I still prefer a D5 though because less noise.
watercooling,3bxnaq,bakageta,1 point,Fri Jul 3 12:44:00 2015 UTC,"Yep, both are perfectly fine for our use. The DDC does generate a bit more heat at the cost of reduced space, but it's still not a bad pump. Generally, my advice is a D5 if you have space, or a DDC for a compact build or if you want to try to hide the pump."
watercooling,3bxnaq,doprahwinfreyIII,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:37:58 2015 UTC,And a lot of cases have a lot of different places to hide pumps now especially with all the different types of mounts. Seems like you could mount a D5 anywhere these days.   Not to mention some if the mods like the bitspower D5 mod which I think looks sexy. Don't hide the pump.
watercooling,3bxejo,techno_babble_,3,Thu Jul 2 23:05:27 2015 UTC,"I found it easiest to plan in Photoshop - paste in a picture of your setup, add your new components and draw in the tubing until you're happy with the result. I didn't make too much effort, just solid colour shapes in as close to a correct position as possible.  I went for the cleanest runs possible and tried to avoid curves, leaving only 90 degree bends visible. Obviously if you're spending on angled fittings you can take those into account.  Don't forget to account for the single-directional inlet/outlet ports on your pump and CPU block (and any other relevant components)."

I just had an idea in my head and did it, Next time I will draw it out beforehand though.  Didn't use any angled fittings either, I think it looks much cleaner that way.

watercooling,3bvg9j,Urbannumb3r,6,Thu Jul 2 14:01:25 2015 UTC,"A good question, never thought of that. I would like to see a test of a rad with different fans in pull config.  I think the air resistance of the radiator should be the same in push and pull. If you use static pressure fans in pull configuration, they create a negative pressure between the fins of the rad. Therefore the rad sucks air in to balance the pressure.  Airflow fans move more air but can't overcome greater resistance. So I think static pressure fans should be also the way to go for pull."
watercooling,3bvg9j,Sulley90,2,Thu Jul 2 14:34:17 2015 UTC,You are correct. SP fans for push or pull.
watercooling,3bvg9j,Sorabella,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:24:36 2015 UTC,"High Pressure fans work better in a pull setup, even with shrouds.  But you can add extra radiator square inches to make up for it."

watercooling,3bucfn,ShaneRD666,3,Thu Jul 2 05:39:13 2015 UTC,"If you want to watercool your cards, you need to understand what a watercooling loop is.  It's a reservoir that contains coolant, which feeds a pump. The pump then pushes water through blocks (basically, big heatsinks you put over your chips). The water goes over the blocks, heats up, and then goes to a radiator, where you use fans to move cool air past the radiator fins, cooling the liquid, which goes back to the reservoir.  If you want to fully cool 2x290s and your CPU, you will need approximately 360mm of radiator space MINIMUM, and that is with no overlclocks. If you want to properly cool that system, I would do at least a 360mm radiator and a 240mm radiator.  Then your setup will look something like this:   Reservoir Pump Radiator #1 GPU #1 GPU #2 CPU Radiator #2   In point of fact, you can have those in any order BUT the reservoir must feed the pump directly. In other words, 1 and 2 must stay the same but 3-7 are flexible.  How you design that loop will depend on your case."

watercooling,3bucfn,xNPi,1 point,Thu Jul 2 06:41:46 2015 UTC,"OK, first, you don't need an i7. A 4670k will perform the exact same in games. There's $250.00 down.  A second 290 will run you another $200. You've got $50 left.  Factor in about $80 for a CPU block, $200 for your GPU blocks, $150 for some radiators, $100 for some fans, $150 for a good pump/res combo, and another $100 for fittings... and you're at just over $1,000.00 you've got to spend BEFORE you get a case, which is probably going to run you between $100 and $200, depending on how big of a case you want.  So, if you want to get a new CPU, new case, new GPU, and upgrade to a full WC loop, be prepared to drop $1200-$1500.  Watercooling is not cheap. It is never as cost-effective as air cooling. But what watercooling can do for you is let you get lower temperatures with lower fan speeds, reducing the noise your PC makes, and prevent GPU throttling when they get hot, which they will do, especially in Crossfire setups in a smaller case.  Still, triple your budget is a LOT to ask for. Why do you want to CF your cards? The 290 is still a very relevant card for gaming on higher settings at 1920x1080."

watercooling,3bucfn,metallives,1 point,Thu Jul 2 16:32:59 2015 UTC,"The -K suffix on Intel CPUs indicates that the CPU can be overclocked (overclocking is when the clock speed is increased; this improves performance in most situations).  The Z- prefix on motherboards indicates that the motherboard supports overclocking.  The other build has you pay more for a Z- chipset motherboard while using a non-overclockable CPU (and a mid-range one, at that).  CPUs almost always come with coolers.  These coolers are not half bad, in general, and while the Hyper 212 Evo is a fantastic cooler, it is not needed for either build unless you're going to extremely overclock the 4690K, and it's certainly not at all needed for the 4460, which, again, cannot be overclocked.  Team Elite RAM is not generally as good as G.Skill RAM.  Also, two sticks look cooler than one, IMHO; there are one-stick variants of the G.Skill RAM in that build.    That particular brand of SSD- Kingston V300- uses a bad kind of NAND, which is a thing in SSDs that processes data.  Yes, it's cheap, but it doesn't perform as well as the Sandisk SSD, which uses the normal kind of NAND.  Also, you don't really need 240 gigs for an SSD if you're getting a 1TB HDD, though if you really want more space in your SSD, there are more capacious variants of that model of Sandisk SSD which are both cheap and fast.  A case does not need to be 80 dollars.  This is mostly a matter of opinion, I suppose, but there are cases that are pretty much as good for a lot less, and the one I linked is a good one.  If there's some feature that you need in your PC case, just tell me and I'll find one that'll work for you.  Fractal Design is not known for their power supplies.  Do not get a power supply from a brand that does not have huge amounts of experience and/or reputability in making power supplies.  Generally, Silverstone, Corsair, Cooler Master, XFX, and EVGA are the only ones you should ever, ever get a power supply from, because IF it goes bad, it can cause power surges and the like that may damage any or all parts in your PC.  Also you didn't need that much wattage, as far as I know; if that's wrong, then there are other PSUs with better price/performance that the one in your build that have a higher capacity than the one in mine."

watercooling,3bu6jo,Andrej_ID,1 point,Thu Jul 2 06:44:34 2015 UTC,Im going to be using the EK Coolstream PE 240. Im only cooling my CPU right now but i definitly have plans to add GPU in there and possibly SLI
watercooling,3bu6jo,Andrej_ID,1 point,Thu Jul 2 07:33:20 2015 UTC,"I suggest PE 360 for the front side (that is 3 x 120mm fans). And one CE radiator (1 x 140mm fan) on the back side. That way you create nice airflow as well as optimal radiator size, even for potential SLI configuration. You really should use as much front space as possible in this case :)"
watercooling,3bu6jo,Erathendil,1 point,Thu Jul 2 11:55:18 2015 UTC,"I ended up doing Push IN Front and Push In top and exhaust rear, To achieve this i had to place the Top Fans on outter mounting position, removed the plastic fan filter and placed mesh between fans and Rad. Overall the the 540 air is great unless you try to fit a 200 MM or larger Res. My case looks like ASS because i didnt account that with Rad in front i could not place a 200mm Res vertically due to GPU clearance.  http://imgur.com/a/E8sbq  I felt So defeated when i couldnt place my res vertically. Screwed my plans completely.   Once I add the second GPU that i have into the loop instead of on air i will post cleaned up pics of the beauty !"

Your tubing is thick, and may not have a good turning radius, so the adapters can help.   yes. yes.  Unless your motherboard has some really high heatsinks, it should be fine.  I am running the same rad set up as you in the top. Heres a review.  Middle if the pack kind of performance, everything is pretty acceptable for a thin rad.

watercooling,3bt2b6,Kamigawa,4,Wed Jul 1 22:32:58 2015 UTC,"First off, especially as a beginner -   If you aren't doing some crazy quad-card / dual socket config / 6+ drives, you don't need a TH10A. That case is big. You're not even running 2011.      All that extra space is going to sit empty, and if you fill it up with rads, you're going to hit diminishing returns very hard. That extra money could go towards an extra GPU or Haswell-E build or whatever. It's one and a half times as fat as the 900D, which is already a big case for a full tower. Granted, the TH10 is a bit more friendly to mod and more flexible in its layout, it's still a really, really big case. For watercooling, unlike peltiers or phase, you can't go below ambient, so adding more radiators just allows it to dissipate heat faster to ambient.  In my instance, running a single 480 60mm thick push-pull, in CPU only loop, brings my 1.4v 3960x to about 70c peaks under P95. Doubling to two 480 60mm push-pull drops it down to 65c. For doubling the hardware ($120 rad, $20x8 GTs, extra fittings) you get a 5c drop.  To answer your questions: - Rads as intakes are the best. For thick rads, use push-pull for optimal performance. - Rule of thumb is 120mm per block + 120 spare. CPU + 2 GPU can be handled by 480mm total space, roughly. Even 360 would be sufficient in almost all cases, as CPU + GPU are not usually simultaneously stressed. - It doesn't matter where your rads go. - Shorter loops help with flow a bit, but mostly it helps keep a clean aesthetic and reduces tangle / clutter. - Loop order doesn't matter as long as res feeds the pump. Water temperature will equalize over time."

watercooling,3bputm,iluvkfc,5,Wed Jul 1 04:42:01 2015 UTC,"Case: Enthoo Pro is a fine case. Best is sort of subjective, but from the reviews / build logs you shouldn't have any issues with the case. Google build logs from OCN to see what ideas people have come up with.  GPU: I understand that midgrade cards might not be worth it, but GPUs are oftentimes the loudest and hottest components in a system. The 970 is a great bang/buck and unless you plan on jumping to 1440 / 4k soon I don't think you'd run into any issues with SLI'd pair.  Loop order: It really doesn't matter what goes where except the res must feed the pump. Mounting the res high is a bit easier to bleed / fill, but ultimately it doesn't matter where it goes.   Component selection: CPU block: popular choices are EK Supremacy Evo / MX, Koolance 380i, XSPC Raystorm  As for reservoir selection, don't neglect that different reservoirs have different inlet/outlet options, and choosing the right res with the right amount of outlets coming out at the right angles makes life a lot easier.  Fans: Best are GTs, which are available on Daz under Darkside mods. People like Corsair SPs for their colored rings, but they are definitely louder. Vardars and Bequiet fans fall somewhere in the middle. Noctuas / Redux fans are expensive and also fall somewhere in the middle but are quiet, although I don't find them worth their cost (but their CS is fantastic bar none).  Pump: Any DDC 3.2 / D5 pump will do. A single pump can support any loop.  Tubing: The proven types are Durelene, Primochill, or Tygon.   Fittings: All typical watercooling fittings will be G1/4"". Fitting size must match OD tubing size.   Kits: Generally I'd recommend mix/matching components so you select the very best component which suits your needs, and you can source the highest 'quality' component. You can also pick components to match a color scheme or feel. Kits don't really save you any money over sourcing individual components."

watercooling,3bputm,nono0044,2,Wed Jul 1 06:08:43 2015 UTC,"Looks okay.  Not sure why you have that many orders of tubing.    In your mockup, you underestimate the length of the 360mm rad.  It will go into the top drive bay.  Watch the gpu length if you plan to use the reservoir bracket.  It can get very very tight.    You can reduce tubing by having the pump be directly connected to the res via a male-male extension (requires a pump top though).  Sorry for the messy comment.  Just typing things as they come to mind."
watercooling,3bputm,nono0044,1 point,Wed Jul 1 14:18:25 2015 UTC,"Others have told me to be wary of the Darkside radiator. I chose their PXM360 model initially. Would you recommend switching to another? On paper it looks much better than anything else I can find for the price since it's on sale.   Looks okay. Not sure why you have that many orders of tubing.   I put 5 tubes because if I'm not mistaken the price is for 1' and I think I'll need about 5 (maybe more or less?)   In your mockup, you underestimate the length of the 360mm rad. It will go into the top drive bay.   I don't think the reservoir going in the top bay will be an issue.   Watch the gpu length if you plan to use the reservoir bracket. It can get very very tight.   Official specs for this case: 277mm clearance with reservoir bracket installed. My cards are... 241mm! So I think I will be fine. I think it can fit pretty much any reference Nvidia card.   You can reduce tubing by having the pump be directly connected to the res via a male-male extension (requires a pump top though).   Hmm it costs only $10 extra to add pump top on the pump I chose.

Are we talking about the reservoir or the radiator?  This is what I mean by attaching the pump to the reservoir.  Its still on the bracket, but the pump isn't at the bottom of the case.  That way your tubing run can be a bit shorter."
watercooling,3bputm,tengen,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:36:51 2015 UTC,"Hmm haven't heard anything about them. All I know is that Darkside is Daz's brand, and he takes some pretty good pride in sourcing from the best to give his customers a good product.   I realized I cannot get the aforementioned rad due to clearance issues - I have 40mm available in my case (65mm clearance-25mm fans). Is this one good? Is it ok if it's 38mm, leaving only 2mm space in best case scenario?   You can just get a 10ft package and cut the tubing to whatever size you need.   The clear tubing is out of stock at NCIX. By the way, if I buy several times 1', do you know whether Daz sends tubing in 1' sections or altogether?   Are we talking about the reservoir or the radiator? This is what I mean by attaching the pump to the reservoir. Its still on the bracket, but the pump isn't at the bottom of the case. That way your tubing run can be a bit shorter.   Uh yes, I meant res. But is it really worth getting this top (any performance reasons or just looks)? Am I saving any fittings or is it just tubing? Because this kind of top you linked is pretty damn expensive it seems."
watercooling,3bputm,tengen,2,Wed Jul 1 19:00:31 2015 UTC,"Should be okay.  You'll just have to run your fans a bit faster to make up for the lost thickness.  If you plan to buy primochill advanced LRT (and you should be), it comes in a retail package where the tubing is one long run of 10'.  It will always be in a box of 10' anywhere you buy it from.  You get more port options and aren't restricted to the barbs that are in the D5 by default.  Since the barbs are 1/2"", you'll need to stretch your tubing a fair bit to get them to fit the barbs.  I'd get the $10 g1/4 top that Daz offers.  You'll end up having to get 1 or two more fittings (depending how you connect it to your res), but then you have the flexibility of using adapters and fittings."
watercooling,3bputm,tengen,2,Wed Jul 1 19:53:20 2015 UTC,"If this is your first time doing tubing, you will definitely need more than 5 feet, I guarantee that. When first starting out as a beginner, it'll be more of a trial-and-error thing. You'll make some waste cuts."
watercooling,3bputm,Whitelabl,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:17:24 2015 UTC,"GPU: I understand that midgrade cards might not be worth it, but GPUs are oftentimes the loudest and hottest components in a system. The 970 is a great bang/buck and unless you plan on jumping to 1440 / 4k soon I don't think you'd run into any issues with SLI'd pair.   I know I need to watercool GPU! But I cannot convince myself to spend $300+ on GPU blocks and maybe extra for another rad. So I will wait and see if I can sell 970s and go to 980 Ti or preferably Pascal when it's out.   Case: Enthoo Pro is a fine case. Best is sort of subjective, but from the reviews / build logs you shouldn't have any issues with the case.   Loop order: It really doesn't matter what goes where except the res must feed the pump.   Component selection: CPU block: popular choices are EK Supremacy Evo / MX  Fans: Best are GTs  Pump: Any DDC 3.2 / D5 pump will do  Tubing: The proven types are Durelene, Primochill, or Tygon.  Fittings: All typical watercooling fittings will be G1/4"". Fitting size must match OD tubing size.  Kits: Generally I'd recommend mix/matching components so you select the very best component which suits your needs   Afaik I took all this into account... So according to you I haven't fucked up completely? And made mostly some decent choices? Do you mind double-checking my parts to see if I haven't made a rookie mistake?"
watercooling,3bputm,Whitelabl,2,Wed Jul 1 06:07:43 2015 UTC,"Just a few thoughts:     I am unfamiliar with that particular radiator, and Darkside is a pretty new company. I'm not sure where they source their rads from.      The D5 strong is unable to operate below 4000 RPM. A D5 vario at 5 is 4800 RPM, D5 strong at max is 5900. I own multiple varios and run them at 5 (it makes no noise, my PSU fan is louder than the pumps properly bled). A D5 strong provides more head but it's not strictly necessary. You can run the strong on normal 12v, but I find the vario's flexibility a bit more useful in case you want to run it at 1 or 2 for whatever reason.      Also consider getting a top to mount the D5, tops do improve flow for inlet/outlet but more importantly allow flexibility in inlet/outlet direction. To pair with the Tank-Z and the top, BP makes a vertical 90 degree stand."

I'm not sure where they source their rads from.   Would you recommend switching to another? On paper it looks much better than anything else I can find for the price since it's on sale.   The D5 strong is unable to operate below 4000 RPM. A D5 vario at 5 is 4800 RPM, D5 strong at max is 5900.

You can run the strong on normal 12v, but I find the vario's flexibility a bit more useful in case you want to run it at 1 or 2 for whatever reason.   I'm a bit confused by this comment. If I understand correctly, I can control the speed of the D5 vario on the fly, but on the D5 strong it can only be done with varying voltage? Dazmode says it runs on ""8-24V"" so I can assume this makes a difference for RPM? Is this really worth a $20+ dollar difference?   Also consider getting a top to mount the D5, tops do improve flow for inlet/outlet but more importantly allow flexibility in inlet/outlet direction. To pair with the Tank-Z and the top, BP makes a vertical 90 degree stand.   It costs an extra $10 to install ""G1/4 threaded top"". Do I really need this flexibility? If I understand correctly, the inlet is at the top and the outlet is at the bottom by default which is how I plan to run it."
watercooling,3bputm,LOLCANADA,2,Wed Jul 1 16:31:57 2015 UTC,"I don't see any reviews on it, so right now it's an unproven quantity. The specs look similar to Alphacool's UT60 rad which performs excellent. 70mm is really thick though, and I would recommend push-pull at that thickness to really extract the benefit of thickness, or a thinner radiator with more FPI. You may not be able to do a push-pull config with a 70mm thick radiator mounted at top.  For D5 strong, you will need an additional converter to convert 12v molex to a 24v line in order to benefit from the strong aspect of the D5 strong, and a stepper to downvolt the pump if you want granular control. See here: https://martinsliquidlab.wordpress.com/2011/03/05/koolance-pmp-450s-d5-strong-pump/  D5 vario does not do speed control on the fly; there's a little knob on the back you set the speed to, and you set and forget because it's not easily accessible once the pump is installed into your rig. The D5 PWM you can adjust speeds via your mobo header, which is questionably useful. What I'm saying is the D5 / D5 vario / D5 pwm are more plug-and-play. The D5 strong requires a bit more hardware.  By default (see review link) you get 1/2"" barb inlet/outlet. It does intake at the top, outlet from the front. It's not very flexible, and  if you want to do skinny tubing, you'd need to replace the top unless you want to deal with two sizes. Threading it makes life a bit easier so you can install your own fittings. Replacing it with a top makes life easier still by allowing inlets / outlets to be in different directions other than top / front respectively."

watercooling,3bm1ki,cvance10,0,Wed Jul 1 19:21:35 2015 UTC,That is not enough radiator area for what you are trying to cool.  You may be in the position to look at external radiators.  Here are a couple of options from Koolance and Swiftech.  You can also get a pretty hardcore rad from Watercool MO-RA3.
watercooling,3bm1ki,Penderyn,3,Tue Jun 30 16:29:04 2015 UTC,Utter bollocks
watercooling,3bm1ki,tengen,0,Tue Jun 30 21:54:17 2015 UTC,"Sure, the Apogee is a fine pump and can handle many rads and blocks, but the better question is whether a (or any) thin 240 can handle a hot 4790 and a 980. You'll need to set your temperature and OC expectations realistically. It'll do better than stock or your low profile CPU coolers, but not by much."
watercooling,3bm1ki,Owan,3,Tue Jun 30 09:50:30 2015 UTC,"A 4790 may run ""hot"" temp wise but doesn't put out that much heat and a GTX980 is also pretty low on the power spectrum as far as modern GPU's go. Most people here are way over on the amount of rad area they need to get respectable temps. If OP is willing to compromise a bit on temps or noise, he can get pretty good results even with a thin 240. As an ncase owner myself, I've researched doing something like this a decent amount and seen plenty of people reporting solid temps even with things like 290X's in their loop. Ultimately though the complexity wasn't worth it for me since its a backup machine anyway."
watercooling,3bm1ki,Penderyn,2,Tue Jun 30 13:31:45 2015 UTC,"Are you actually kidding? It's an 88w chip, you could could cool it with a butterfly. Maxwell is also extremely efficient. A 240 rad will net him great temps."
watercooling,3bm1ki,tengen,1 point,Tue Jun 30 21:53:18 2015 UTC,"And I'm saying it's not going to give him an OC overhead above 1.3v. There's limitations to heat dissipation, it's quieter and more efficient than air but it's not a magical solution that gives you 40c 980 loads or sub 70c Prime around 1.3v. I'm saying the 240 is adequate,and will realistically good him 50-55 typical gaming load tempos, not the crazy low temps people tout when under water."

watercooling,3bm1ki,tengen,2,Tue Jun 30 12:26:21 2015 UTC,"Not gonna lie, I think hardware forums is a lot better place to ask about this. Last time I asked about water cooling an m1 people here said ""that won't work"" then I looked at hardware and 10+ people had done it with ease. There is a big difference between optimal and acceptable temps. I find a lot of people here want optimal temps and anything less is not good.  There are many different types of people here, but that was my experience, and it's the same answer you are getting as I did.  I'm not the m1 myself, ordering water cooling stuff soon, but I spent most of my time there looking at what others did. I'm fine with a little higher temps. If you are too, and someone else did it, rock on.  The main thing I would consider is making sure your radiator is build for high efficiency and your fans are as well."

watercooling,3bmr1a,TinyRumchata,1 point,Tue Jun 30 14:37:06 2015 UTC,Which do you recommend?  Copper  or nickel?  How much do you recommend a d5 pump for coming CPU and a graphics card?
watercooling,3bmr1a,bakageta,2,Tue Jun 30 16:01:48 2015 UTC,"Nickel blocks are just copper blocks with nickel plating, as nickel transfers heat worse. However, copper oxidizes, which won't hurt performance but looks ugly. Performance-wise, a nickel plated block is so close to a pure copper that it's moot. It's an aesthetic choice, nickel plating adds cost generally.  Anymore, there are a ton of solid watercooling companies, and the best performing brand will vary from item to item. Unless you have a ridiculous setup, or are trying to use parts well over a decade old, the performance difference will generally be very small. You can put together a loop with cheap older designs that's in single-digital differences from the best with a little planning, and air won't even be close.  Almost all of the various pumps are rebrands of the DDC series or D5 series. The D5 is larger but runs a little cooler, it's probably the choice for you unless you're really tight on space (or catch a cheap ddc, they perform very similarly for our use)."
watercooling,3bmr1a,fijibean,1 point,Tue Jun 30 17:50:16 2015 UTC,"there are some graphics cards, like (Sapphire or Gigabyte cards) that have like 3 fans so they seem much larger then the original reference cards. Will regular gpu blocks work on them?"
watercooling,3bmr1a,bakageta,2,Wed Jul 1 13:18:56 2015 UTC,"It can be confusing, but reference/non-reference coolers are different than reference/non-reference PCBs (the circuit boards).    Non-reference coolers can be on reference PCBs (Sapphire's Tri-X) while other times they are on non-reference boards (Sapphire Vapor-X).  Water blocks are made to fit PCBs and usually reference ones.  However, there are blocks made for non-reference boards, when the card is popular enough.  EK, for instance, makes some blocks for Asus, EVGA, and MSI non-reference cards.  Use their coolingconfigurator to check specific cards.  For other companies, you just have to read the information on the block."
watercooling,3bmr1a,TinyRumchata,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:20:35 2015 UTC,"Late reply but exactly this. Some reference PCBs use nonstandard coolers, other nonstandard coolers are on non-reference PCBs, which virtually never have a waterblock. Even if you want to use a different brand block, EK's site is perfect for checking card info."

watercooling,3bmr1a,tedlasman,1 point,Tue Jun 30 17:29:44 2015 UTC,"You will need a radiator, and fans. How large of a radiator depends on how much heat you're dumping in and how your fans perform. Some of the killer 38mm fans will handle twice as much heat in the same space as quiet options."

watercooling,3bmep0,Jawa247,2,Tue Jun 30 11:51:41 2015 UTC,"Personal experience:  PETG is easier to bend and more forgiving during the process.  It's a LOT more forgiving of any pressure you may end up having on the bends if your angles aren't exactly right.  Chamfering the ends of the tubing for your fittings is more difficult, as a standard reamer don't work.  The PETG is just too soft.  Sanding works fine though.  Haven't painted it personally but I'm a firm believer that with the proper prep work anything can be painted.  I've used Primochill Revolver fittings many times in the past and absolutely love them."
watercooling,3bmep0,Retrosmith,2,Tue Jun 30 13:54:03 2015 UTC,"PETG is also much easier to cut. I recently changed almost all of the tubing in my system to PETG (had a serious leak and was changing some things anyways. I much preferred working with the PETG. While I never understood the problem of having acrylic (prone the shattering) in a system, I'd stick with PETG for now on just because of the ease of use."

They did remedy that with a change to the resistor value so that the fan turns on earlier on later runs of the 750w and 850w versions, but I see where you're coming from.  To be honest, 1kW was probably too much for what I have (a single i5-4690k and an r9 290, but like I said, the PSU was given to me by a friend who changed his mind on his PSU).  I'll take a look at the 1300G2 though. Thanks!"

Just asked around in r/pcsleeving and it appears the AX860i has the same cable pinout as the RM1000, so at the very least, the cables I made would still work.

On a more serious note, did you try to run the pump with some standard tubing and a res to look at the flow? Could be a pump issue. Nothing I see is too crazy. I mean only one of your bends is longer than it needs to be.  I don't know, get a short loop going with just the pump, before you double your pump costs.  Look at singularity. dude builds computer after computer with even more components on single D5s.  Also,   it appears my pump isn't pushing enough water. I've rotated my case all around to try and get the air out but there are just air bubbles everywhere that don't seem to move.   We don't know exactly what this means to you. It would have been good if we saw a quick video of the water flow going into the res. Even a tiny phone video would work."
watercooling,3bibji,darrenphillipjones,0,Mon Jun 29 13:52:55 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the response. I haven't tried that with the pump yet, although it is the same pump I was using in a soft tubing build a few months back and it was working fine then. The funny thing is that build was in a 900D and had larger radiators.   New development: I fired up the pump again this morning to try and capture a video for you of the res flow. Pump pushed out a few air bubbles so I rotated the case a bit and it seems to have pushed out the rest. Pump finally stopped making that sound it makes when it has air stuck in it.   Maybe I was premature in thinking there was a problem? I just feel like it shouldn't require this much effort (I literally tilted and rotated this case for hours) to get air bubbles out to start a leak test. I still have to drain it and fill with coolant and don't want to go through this every time I have to drain for whatever reason."

watercooling,3bf3d9,joshruffdotcom,2,Sun Jun 28 17:30:00 2015 UTC,"240mm is not enough radiator space for your setup. The general guideline for radiator surface area is 120mm of rad space per cooling block. I like to double that just to be on the safe side.   If you're looking for the best cooling performance vs noise level, watercooling is the way to go. Just be prepared to make a sizable investment in all the equipment you need-- don't cut corners by going for the cheapest gear. You get what you pay for. I recommend EK waterblocks.

The reservoir is tiny and bleeding that system with a gpu block and additional radiator is... not fun to say the least. I tried to fix that by adding a reservoir to the mix but air still gets trapped in the tiny reservoir of the H220-X and is not very easy to get out.    There is a bleeder screw on the H220-X, terribly placed on the reservoir window. Check out the swiftech forum, lots of cracked windows, I have been thru 2 myself.

Given your specs I don't think cheaping out on a loop is a great idea anyway.  This sub generally recommends a minimum of 120mm of rad per-block plus 120mm. Whilst two 240s would do you fine I'd personally prefer a 360 and 240 because that extra surface area would mean I can run the fans slower to cut some noise.  As it is I'd recommend getting a slightly bigger mATX case (Enthoo Evolv, 350D, Arc Mini R2) before investing in watercooling. I'm not sure even the two hybrid coolers would fit in your current case (a 120mm rad is not going to be exactly 120mm wide because of bezels, so you probably won't get two on a 240mm mount) so you may need to upsize to sort this cooling issue anyway."

Basically the AIO coolers keep your core cooled okay, but they don't do anything for the VRAM, and that limits your ability to OC as well as running at a much higher temp over all. The highest I see with the Titan X hydro copper is 55 celcius under 100% load after an hour. For reference, a 295x2 with the AIO cooler maxed out and got throttled at 75c (because the VRAM was much hotter than that) in under 5 minutes.

That'll generate a lot more heat. Idling at 40C with low fan speeds makes sense. Under stress test conditions, 70-75 are fine temperatures. There is a point where you start receiving diminishing returns in a loop.   What type of CPU block do you have? What type of coolant?  Edit: Forgot to ask... Have you bled your loop properly and got any air bubbles in the CPU block out?"

They have every variant except crossflows I believe. Order in your loop does not have a significant impact on temperatures. The only stead fast rule is your res must feed your pump, can't have it run dry, which is easy with the combos."
watercooling,3balo0,herminzerah,1 point,Sat Jun 27 12:51:02 2015 UTC,"Thanks, the Alphacool XT45 looks perfect (and it's a good performer too according to that extremerigs article). Do all the manufacturers play nice with the same screw threads and whatnot?  The ""order"" question wasn't about the actual order, it was more to see if I should just have GPU > CPU > 1x 280mm radiator (on the left in this pic) or if there would be tangible benefits if I put a rad between the GPU and the CPU as well as one between the CPU and the reservoir/pump (on the right in that pic)."
watercooling,3balo0,herminzerah,2,Sat Jun 27 20:19:55 2015 UTC,"I would go with one continuous radiator personally, nets you greater fin surface area as well I believe do to there being less cut off to account for the shroud around them.  Also I would recommend the res combo versus a bay reservoir. There is overall more flexibility. As far as case selection goes, it's purely up to you as long as you are willing to work with any unique quirks the case has. It is overall easier to go with one specifically geared towards a watercooling setup but it is not necessary."
watercooling,3balo0,F0erster,1 point,Sun Jun 28 01:50:46 2015 UTC,Don't split up the rads just to get one between each part. Water absorbs high amounts of energy (heat) with only a slight increase of temperature. You might think After passing the gpu the watertemp is the same as the GPU temp (maybe 50 celsius)  but thats wrong. The water passes the block so fast it can bareley take enough energy with it to rise 10 degrees or more. Instead the whole loop gets warmer over time when the water passes the block a second time. It's a continuous flow that reaches an equilibrium after time. Loop order wont matter in the big scale. You can gain maybe 1degree celsius with a lot of trouble and work. Just do the shortest and easiest routes.
watercooling,3balo0,kip69,1 point,Mon Jun 29 07:11:26 2015 UTC,"This is the truth AFAIK.  We had some talk about it on OCN.  With normal operation, the water is a constant temperature in the whole loop.  One big rad will be more efficient than 2 smaller ones."

Just a general piece of advice for the world of watercooling, if you're embarking on this journey, you need to invest in the right equipment. Even if that equipment is pricey. If you go cheap now, you'll pay for it later when cheap gear break down and ruin your components.   Aside from that, here's a few thoughts around the things you linked specifically.   CPU Block - I really wouldn't go with a pump/CPU block combination like that unless you have space constraints. If you have the space, buy a stand alone pump + res combo (like this) or buy your own pump and separate res.    GPU Block - Good choices here. EK blocks are top notch.   Additionally, FrozenCPU.com is shut down. The site is up but the company is closed own. Performance-PCs.com is the best US-based alternative."
watercooling,3b9x0o,specikk,1 point,Sat Jun 27 15:14:38 2015 UTC,Thank you for the reply!   I do have space concerns. I'm building a mini ITX build in an Ncase.   All of these parts came from a custom loop someone already has done in this case. I'm not a big fan of the pump cpu block combination though. Some people have nose complaints.   Do you have recommendations for a compact build? Specifically for the cpu block and pump?   I was hoping on getting a pump that could attach to the reservoir but I don't think that will happen since it's a reservoir that's custom fitted to the case.
watercooling,3b9x0o,domp_,1 point,Sat Jun 27 20:02:51 2015 UTC,"Having built in an Ncase m1, the only place you can mount a pump, for example a DDC, would be on the bottom of the case. Also, make sure to use angled fittings where you need them."

I saw this post and just wanted to give some insight and advice.   The Apogee is not any louder than a pump res combo. Especially considering its an mcp35x. My main concern with the apogee was the temperatures, but I am actually having better temperatures than I was with my old setup with EK supremacy and mcp35x/res combo.  I would highly discourage you from mounting the pump separately on the bottom of the case. It is just going to complicate the loop in an already tight case, and in the Ncase, space is your biggest enemy. I will also mention that your linked radiator is 35mm. That is probably ok, but like I said space is your biggest concern. I am using an ST30.  Make sure you have angled fittings also! I used 7 90degree fittings in mine. The drain on the build you linked is genius! I need to switch mine like that."
watercooling,3b9x0o,Doppeled,1 point,Mon Jun 29 19:40:22 2015 UTC,Thank you for the post reply!   With the Apogee what were your temperatures exactly? Were you able to overclock your components?   I actually found a pump that could possibly work if i mounted it to the bottom: http://www.performance-pcs.com/laing-ddc-pumpe-12v-ddc-1plus-incl-phobya-laing-ddc-pump-silver-nickel-edition.html  But if the temperatures are fine then i would rather go with the Apogee. Also is it an i7 and 980?
watercooling,3b9x0o,domp_,1 point,Tue Jun 30 03:34:37 2015 UTC,"That's a DDC 1Plus, you'd need an adapter from 4 pin molex to 3 pin to control it via voltage. In case you decide to mount a pump on the bottom, I recommend a ddc pump with pwm control."

watercooling,3b7g81,Player-X,1 point,Sat Jun 27 07:09:11 2015 UTC,"As long as both metals are in contact with the same circulating water galvanic corrosion will happen, it's fine if your radiator uses copper tubes or a copper core but aluminium fins because the aluminium never touches the water.  Reusing a copper heatsink surrounded by acrylic as a top could work, you can use a drill press to hollow out a stock CPU cooler and put a piece of acrylic on top sealed with an o-ring and use that as your heat block"

watercooling,3b7g81,Player-X,1 point,Sat Jun 27 11:18:42 2015 UTC,"O-rings are rubber gaskets that keep the interface between two surfaces water tight, for you'll probably be looking to create something like this, the o-ring is the rubber piece that runs along the perimeter of the copper and presses up against the acrylic to create a water-tight seal.  Modern intel coolers such as the one in this article have a copper core surrounded by aluminium fins, as long as the water never touches the aluminium it'll be fine to keep the fins if you use the copper core as your main heat block"
watercooling,3b7g81,Player-X,1 point,Sat Jun 27 21:42:28 2015 UTC,"O-ring:       An O-ring, also known as a packing, or a toric joint, is a mechanical gasket in the shape of a torus; it is a loop of elastomer with a round cross-section, designed to be seated in a groove and compressed during assembly between two or more parts, creating a seal at the interface.  The O-ring may be used in static applications or in dynamic applications where there is relative motion between the parts and the O-ring. Dynamic examples include rotating pump shafts and hydraulic cylinder pistons.  O-rings are one of the most common seals used in machine design because they are inexpensive, easy to make, reliable, and have simple mounting requirements. They can seal tens of megapascals (thousands of psi) of pressure.

Some fluid will always get stuck in various parts, just due to physics, but a fair bit of manipulating the case should get the majority, then just be careful when you disassemble."
watercooling,3b3846,Jeengy,2,Thu Jun 25 16:35:14 2015 UTC,"For peace of mind, take apart the block and clean it out with soap, hot water, and a toothbrush. Don't damage o rings and rinse well with distilled after if using tap to clean.  If you have algae at the CPU block, you should check other areas of your loop as well.  Run a biocide next time to prevent this from happening."
watercooling,3b3846,kevzhu,1 point,Thu Jun 25 18:45:52 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the input! Do you happen to know the procedure to take apart the block? Is it pretty straightforward?   I was using pt nuke but apparently i didnt put enough, i have been using a silver coil for a few months and it seems to be working a lot better for me (distilled water no dye all copper)"
watercooling,3b3846,kevzhu,1 point,Thu Jun 25 18:54:39 2015 UTC,"Straightforward, undo the bolts and it comes apart The trickier part is reassembling as you have to get the o ring to sit perfectly in the groove, and make sure you don't over tighten and strip things. A leak test here is good  You seem to know what you're doing additive-wise so good luck!"
watercooling,3b3846,_monad,1 point,Thu Jun 25 19:04:23 2015 UTC,"Get the large chunks of algae out, flush the loop to get out smaller bits. Then four drops of pt nuke in a loop, run the system for a couple hours to completely kill any hint of biological growth. Then drain it and flush the biocide out. Afterwards, your kill coil should suffice.   Also, FYI, the Fury X trades blows with the 980ti at stock speeds only, once over clocked the 980ti beats it out by significant margin on most games. This is because the 980ti has excellent over clock potential while the Fury X has literally none.. well maybe 50-100MHz, AMD sucked out every bit of processing power it possibly could at stock speeds in order to market it against the 980ti using prerelease benchmarks."

Beware of the SP120 high performance edition, they are designed for vertical placement, and can make a rattling sound when used in a horizontal exhaust mount.

watercooling,3b3aul,kevzhu,1 point,Thu Jun 25 19:57:24 2015 UTC,"Losing head pressure at the 2nd reservoir could be an issue if your loop has very restrictive portions. You'll probably be ok because strong pump.  I'm not sure about the quiet editions. Sleeve bearing fans are not recommended for horizontal mounting because of the weight dynamics and SP is all sleeve. On the other hand, non sleeve bearing fans like noctua are also a lot more pricey"
watercooling,3b360o,risarnchrno,1 point,Thu Jun 25 16:20:24 2015 UTC,Only the manufacturers know until they release it or advertise it. A good way to check is to see if the older versions of the card received a water block.

watercooling,3b2kk2,knightman412,2,Thu Jun 25 13:32:12 2015 UTC,Why do you have to clean out and refresh the fluid/loop every 6-10 months? Why not just when there is a temperature issue?
watercooling,3b2kk2,kevzhu,2,Thu Jun 25 18:05:17 2015 UTC,"I think it's so cheap to do that there's no reason not to. If you planned your loop well it is easy too.   Think of it like changing the oil in your car. Everybody drives their car differently than the next person, so the recommended 6-10 month oil change does not apply to everyone. However it certainly doesn't hurt to change your oil early and can prevent worse things from happening.  By the time you see a temperature issue, something has gone wrong to the point that it could cause damage to components, especially if they are in high heat conditions with poor cooling."

watercooling,3b2kk2,Mynameisntbrian,1 point,Thu Jun 25 15:53:59 2015 UTC,The phantom 410 supports a 240 on the top and you can even fit a thicker 120 in the front. Did you mean like the rad mounted on the bottom and then mount the fans on top? If so yes. I used to use a phantom 410.   You can probably fit a 240 in the front if you mod it.

watercooling,3b2kk2,kevzhu,2,Fri Jun 26 16:30:37 2015 UTC,"Usually no, but with some aftermarkets yes. I believe EVGA does some binning, as in classy's should be able to clock slightly better than the reference in terms of Silicon lottery. Also some aftermarkets use different PCB designs (classy has extra VRMs) which can definitely improve your overclock, but that non-reference PCB also needs a different water block than the reference model.  Reference is great for water block compatibility, but you might be able to get slightly better OC with the classy or SC, etc. I don't know how big this difference is but I would wager marginal, and only if you are doing extreme OC"

watercooling,3b2kk2,ICanHazTehCookie,1 point,Fri Jun 26 19:53:34 2015 UTC,"Yes, for example, if you're aiming for silence, there are radiators that will perform better when used with low rpm fans than the ones that come in kits. Not necessarily because the rads in kits are bad, but because they are not designed with low rpm fans in mind. The same goes for fans. And you will be able to choose better-performing waterblocks.  I picked parts individually for my 4790k and 290x loop, and with 360mm of radiator and fans, it cost me about $650 for basically top-quality everything; when looking at individual parts it doesn't seem like that much, but it adds up quickly. Don't be afraid to spend a bit more, you can use a custom loop in your system for a long time and only change waterblocks whenever you upgrade components."

The WC solution is lame but the air cooled chip will be just as powerful and 100$ less reportedly    It does worse on many other games.   sure, as do AMD developed games for NVIDIA cards. what's your point.  no screws missing as of last build. AMD did the same thing last release. 290x first, 290 a month and change later so they can soak up the sales of the more expensive and profitable solution just like the 980, titanX and 980ti scheme.

watercooling,3b1pm5,KlockworkEU,1 point,Thu Jun 25 13:52:47 2015 UTC,"They look crazy cheap, and I can't find any independent reports on them. Just the same, the mounting system looked kinda cool and I was wondering if anyone had ever used these to cool their GPU, cpu & vrms in a loop. There's a $15 radiator in the recommended stuff there, combined this could be a complete custom loop for ~$40 (assuming it didn't leak all over and destroy everything). Just curious if this would be a good just-for-funsies type side project or if anyone had any experience whatsoever with them."

watercooling,3b0usc,GUMP-A-TRON,4,Thu Jun 25 01:48:00 2015 UTC,"To a limit, yes. 120mm fan mount will usually hold a rad (unless the port section touches another. Like the front rad touching the top rad). You need a 120mm for every part, and an extra 120mm. So you have 3 parts = 360mm + 120 = 480mm rad space needed. I like to fill it up with rads, so fans can run slower and you could get a slight increase in cooling capacity. Btw, after a certain point, it's not very worthwhile to get more rads, as the returns aren't as great. Iirc, the hybrid cooler only cools the die on the GPU, leaving the other parts to the air cooler, which could affect overclocks. The custom loop cools everything. It does give good temps for hybrid though, so it's up to you to decide if you like that or if it's not worth it. It's not really a better alternative. I mean, even air cooling is fine, unless you want to really push your parts and have lots of rad space. Depending on how many radiators, if you use soft or hard tubing, lots of fittings (if you're using hard),  it could cost around $530 to $1k+ (CAN, haven't checked for the US). Personally, I prefer the 4k since you're using 2 cards. If it was only one, then 1440p would be my choice. You'll pull over 60fps at 4k, which is good enough. Some people would just prefer a 144hz refresh though. Go to a store and compare mouse movements if they don't have games for you to try out."

Worked pretty well. I ended up using a bay reservoir, but there is plenty of room for a non-bay res if you remove one or more of the drive cages. It has mounting areas for a 360/420 on top, up to a 240 in the front and bottom, and a 120 in the back. There's some nice builds using this case (or the Enthoo Pro) in the gallery."

watercooling,3b04l9,Nyxi26,2,Thu Jun 25 08:42:35 2015 UTC,Two things from my own personal experience that fufill your requirements are the NZXT Switch 810 and the Corsair Carbide Air 540.  The switch 810 if you remove the lower hard drive bays there's room for a 240 at the bottom and a 360 at the top by default.  You can also mount another 240 or even 280 against the front two intake fans with a small bit of modding. Then a tube res between the optical bays and mobo or anywhere else. (I put my photon 170/d5 against the back exhaust in place of the exhaust fan.   Then the Air 540 the dual chamber there's a lot of possibilities on where to mount stuff. And you can mount a 240 to the top and a 360 to the front.

watercooling,3azisq,doprahwinfreyIII,1 point,Wed Jun 24 20:07:32 2015 UTC,"Thermaltake is known as the brand that makes cheap copies of the popular brands.  That being said, as an intro to water cooling some of their stuff is ok, for example the pacific pump and res combo.  The main red flag in the kit you linked is the radiator - it's all aluminium.  Ideally you want a radiator with at least a copper core and brass chambers for two reasons - cooling performance and avoiding corrosion.   Aluminium will cause corrosion when mixed with copper, and the tiniest scratch in a nickel plated block that includes aluminium in the loop will also eventually lead to corrosion."
watercooling,3azisq,beautifulagony,1 point,Wed Jun 24 21:37:55 2015 UTC,"Thermaltake radiators are aluminium and their tubing contains plasticisers; both will damage your loop/blocks and should be avoided at all costs.  If you're cooling a CPU+GPU that 240mm rad isn't really going to be enough anyway. Ideally you want 120mm per component plus an extra 120mm.  Kits are often good value but I'd still shop around first, and I'd also avoid Thermaltake completely."
watercooling,3azisq,Nyxi26,1 point,Wed Jun 24 22:00:45 2015 UTC,If you're going to get a kit buy either an EK kit or XSPC. They use quality components and you'll thank yourself later for spending the extra money.

However I will agree to the fact that using nickel in loops can cause many issues. I have never used nickel but have had friends do builds and most have lead unwanted corrosion buildup inside water blocks and pumps. My oppinion would be to go with the EK res. I hope this helps.

watercooling,3ayqfd,schwiing,3,Wed Jun 24 18:46:44 2015 UTC,Mixing metals in a loop is only a problem when you mix metals that are very dissimilar. I've mixed copper/nickel for years with 100% distilled water. Now if you add a kill coil (silver) and nickel and copper...yeah that may cause issues.
watercooling,3ayqfd,schwiing,1 point,Wed Jun 24 19:14:34 2015 UTC,"I assume you were using a biocide in your distilled water too, right? That was my plan. From what I read, the issue with nickel is not corrosion (it has a similar anodic index to copper/bronze, which I intend to use in my loop), but rather occasional flaking, which caused it to gunk up blocks and look ugly."

I like it better because of better heat transfer and greater surface area to get the most out of your cooling loop. Of course it is your build but thats just my opinion on that.  As far as the UV lights and tubing. Any color UV light will work, but for the best result I would go with a blue UV light to get the best look. I use Blue UV reactive coolant and blue UV cold cathode lights with my build."
watercooling,3ayoi4,Aparks89,1 point,Wed Jun 24 17:28:44 2015 UTC,"Thanks for replying! Unfortunately the Enthoo Luxe only has 65mm clearance on top, so I can't fit a radiator thicker than 40mm. I think someone with that case said they managed to fit a 45mm rad but they ended up bending the fan headers at the top of the motherboard and I'd rather avoid that. If a 420x140x3 rad is not enough I will add a 240 rad on the front, but I think I should be fine with the current setup. What do you think?  For the UV light is it better to go colored UV light + colored tube or have one of them clear?"

watercooling,3ayhh0,reymern,3,Wed Jun 24 14:53:26 2015 UTC,"Well, if you keep the moduvents - then your fans are starve for air.   You're right about moving the rad to the front of you want to keep the moduvents."
watercooling,3ayhh0,Whitelabl,2,Wed Jun 24 15:20:33 2015 UTC,Are those good temps though? I assume they'll get better with more airflow. This is my first custom loop so I don't know exactly what to expect
watercooling,3ayhh0,cvance10,2,Wed Jun 24 15:45:14 2015 UTC,No those temps are higher than I would expect.
watercooling,3ayhh0,anotheraznguy,1 point,Wed Jun 24 17:12:50 2015 UTC,CPU temps arent that bad. but your GPU temp seems pretty high for being on water.   What GPU block are you using? any pic of the setup so we can see what exactly you are doing?

watercooling,3ayhh0,Techonup,1 point,Wed Jun 24 19:33:47 2015 UTC,So all three of the top fans are exhaust and the moduvents are off correct?  One thing that you may not want to hear is that you may want to take apart your gpu and re-tim it. You may have put too much/little.

watercooling,3ayhh0,Michael-Cera,1 point,Wed Jun 24 17:11:28 2015 UTC,Check you pump's rating. I think some could be damaged with 60-65 C liquid temps. Have you measured the temperature of the liquid in your res yet?

For instruments, I used a thermal probe for my multimeter. A clinical thermometer likely wouldn't work over 45 C. You could buy a lab or meat thermometer for a reasonable price.

watercooling,3azsc8,Lustig1374,1 point,Wed Jun 24 20:39:33 2015 UTC,What are you attempting to cool?
watercooling,3azsc8,Kautkto,2,Wed Jun 24 20:56:06 2015 UTC,"A TEC (480w) and a CPU (300w), so 780w on the hot side of the TEC. I'm using for theoretical TDPs for the maximum power draw, just to be safe."
watercooling,3azsc8,Kautkto,1 point,Wed Jun 24 21:01:51 2015 UTC,"I'll try to help you later if I can determine this isn't another of your shit posts. Can you submit proof that you're actually looking to cool these?  Including a brief description of what you have and what you're expecting to do. Not often I see someone wanting to cool a tec down with a consumer water loop...   For example, what the heck is your tec cooling. And you are wanting to cool a CPU along the side? Seriously?"
watercooling,3azsc8,Kautkto,2,Wed Jun 24 21:19:30 2015 UTC,"It's not a trollpost and I'm just planning. I compared a few high powered TECs and tried finding power supplies in their range. Then I calculated their new qW using the voltages I could actually run them at. The TEC I picked can transport 331W if supplied with 31.5V and 17A. The closest power supply I could find was 30V and 16A, which would result in 297 W of cooling. That would be enough to cool a 250W CPU by 10-20°c below ambient, a 300W CPU would see no difference in temps. Condensation is another issue, but right now I'm just looking for a way to get 800W away from the TEC. Kinda difficult on Air or AiO, which is why I asked."
watercooling,3azsc8,doprahwinfreyIII,1 point,Wed Jun 24 21:40:34 2015 UTC,Air with fans could work. Most higher end radiators can dissipate around 250w per 120mm with static pressure of around 4mm and rpm 1800 and I think 10c above ambient. Obviously this is pretty loud and heavily dependant on the fan/radiator configuration and you also have limitations based on the size of the heatspreader. Multiple water based heatsinks or a hybrid solution?   Not sure if I will actually get around to providing a formula as I'm on my phone and tend to get a bit lazy after work.

A tube reservoir I think as the 5.25"" bays in the air 540 are vertical instead of horizontal and I think that would mean trouble? Or doesn't it matter what the reservoirs position is? I don't really have another purpose for the vertical 5.25"" bays as it'd look ugly with a DVD drive or something but a reservoir would look nice. But like I said, would its orientation cause problems? The reservoirs are designed for more standard cases.. thanks for commenting!"
watercooling,3azptj,Boy1998,1 point,Wed Jun 24 21:08:14 2015 UTC,"Btw, you don't need 1/2 ID - 3/4 OD. It just means the size of the tube. ID = inner diameter. The size inside the tube; how wide the inner portion is. OD = outer. Tube's outer end to outer end.  Go to their website and look at the sizes. Pick a size you'll like (use a ruler and imagine it). Do you want the thicker tubing or thinner? They won't affect performance. It's just aesthetics."

When you want to drain your loop (maintenance, upgrade, etc.) you just turn the valve open and let it flow out. It costs about €20 (new price is 216,93). Do you want this? It's really useful, but not necessary. It could save potential spills in our case (it won't matter if it does spill, since everything is unpowered at this point, but still. Hassle-free draining.)  Could you possibly save up and add it, or just leave it out? I added a biocide (bacteria killer) and red dye. You add one drop at a time, see if it's coloured enough, and add another drop if it isn't. Powerful, concentrated stuff that should last 2-3 refills."

watercooling,3awvdq,schwiing,11,Wed Jun 24 06:19:15 2015 UTC,"Maybe not, but I don't see how that justifies publicly condemning EKWB because you had a bad experience and didn't give them a chance to do anything about it.   The first waterblock available for my card was a nickel-plated block by EKWB, and I purchased it when it came out. That was back in december. My loop was together for 6 months before I took it apart to switch to PETG tubing. When I took my blocks apart for cleaning, all I found was some discoloration that I was able to clean off with a microfiber cloth.   EKWB have published so many reports on nickel corrosion; did you read them? Their testing generally lead to the conclusion that distilled water with copper sulphate or a silver kill coil lead to corrosion, while using their Ekoolant or similar coolants only resulted in some discoloration. Why not just use something like Ekoolant and be on the safe side?  Based on your other comments, you probably feel like I'm victim blaming. All that I'm saying, however, is that doing some research lead me to use Mayhem's - who OEMs for EKWB's pastel line - in my loop, and I've had no corrosion issues after 6 months. I doubt that I just got magical corrosion-resistant blocks.   I am sorry that you had a bad experience, and I understand how frustrating it must be to throw away parts that you payed so much for. All I ask is that you not be so eager to steer people away from EKWB or much more importantly watercooling as a whole because of that one bad experience."
watercooling,3awvdq,ValttheNord,-5,Wed Jun 24 04:32:43 2015 UTC,"I'm not steering anyone anywhere.  I'm recounting a recent experience during my 15 years of watercooling.  If I am condemning EKWB, it is for not taking responsibility for a shitty product.  As you just said, they repeatedly blamed the issue on silver coils and copper sulphate.  Since neither touched my blocks, it is obviously a weak excuse.   I don't know if you bought magical corrosion-resistant blocks.  If you did, lucky you.  I didn't.  If the nickel-plated problem was so well-known, why was FrozenCPU still selling these blocks in January 2015?  The sketchiness of FrozenCPU aside, EKWB knew there was a problem with these blocks as early as 2010, and could have exchanged their retailer's stock."
watercooling,3awvdq,Boy1998,5,Wed Jun 24 08:23:22 2015 UTC,"They didn't just blame the issue on silver kill-coils and copper sulphate; they did testing and provided strong evidence that they caused issues with nickel plating. That's just science, in the same way that aluminum has been shown to cause issues with nickel and copper. As such, I'm lead to believe the issue is not with nickel-plating but people not using the recommended coolants with nickel-plated products.   When EKWB posts stuff like this telling users to ALWAYS use ""market proven pre-mix coolant such as Ekoolant"" with their products, it's hard to be surprised by people having issues with distilled water and whatever random additives they've been told to use over the years. That's like buying a car that runs on diesel, using gasoline, and blaming any resulting issues on the manufacturer."
watercooling,3awvdq,StellaTerra,-5,Wed Jun 24 14:44:05 2015 UTC,"You obviously have more energy when it comes to defending EKWB than I do when it comes to defending my experience.    Even though I was careful to point out my prior knowledge of watercooling, commenters have done nothing but endlessly suggest that I must have used mixed metals in my loop, or failed in the cleaning or preparation of my loop, or ""not done my research"".   And you're still responding to my posts as if I up and decided to urinate in my loop rather than use distilled water and a proven anti-corrosive agent."
watercooling,3awvdq,Boy1998,3,Wed Jun 24 16:30:31 2015 UTC,"I'm sure you didn't mix metals. It's pretty hard to find watercooling components made of anything but copper, brass, and nickel unless you're buying some really cheap stuff which you didn't. I am, however, saying that you're not telling us what you used in your coolant. You keep saying ""distilled water and an anti-corrosive"", but you don't mention an anti-microbial nor do you mention what anti-corrosive. And you say a proven anti-corrosive agent, but is it proven by people with just copper components or people with nickel-plated components? You act like nickel-plating should behave just like copper products, but it isn't going to because nickel and copper have different properties."

watercooling,3awvdq,Nyxi26,1 point,Wed Jun 24 17:07:15 2015 UTC,This sub seems very pro-EKWB but a lot of other forums on the internet avoid EK because of issues like this I have always assumed.  Is this an EK specific risk?  I thought this was well known?
watercooling,3awvdq,techno_babble_,5,Wed Jun 24 15:26:05 2015 UTC,"Every manufacturer has issues at times.  Alphacool has good rads but they need serious cleaning, their elbow joints often leak and their blocks are very meh.  XSPC has some sub-standard products like their older bay res designs and pump housings.  Aquacomputer has awful English support and also had some problems with their reservoirs a while back.  EK had the nickel plating fiasco etc.  There's simply a lot that can go wrong with watercooling, so most companies have made a blunder or two, some recurring in an area.  This tends to be why many communities group up under certain manufacturers.  Personally I've never had a problem with EK and I've been using nickel plated blocks for 4 years now.  That said, I like to spread myself across a number of brands, means you can pick the best bits from each."

We'll I'm about to tell you something you're not going to like:  It largely doesn't matter :D  Yup.  Just figure out how much space you have for your parts, then shop around for stuff that'll fit. Brands are important, just not as important as you'd think they'd be.  This is the best advice I can give because I ended up buying an XSPC Photon 170 res/pump combo only to find it didn't fit inside my case (NZXT Phantom 530)- ended up drilling some holes on the cable-side panel and sticking it on the outside...  Here's some general tips though:   you can buy an Alphacool radiator and sleep soundly.  Same goes for Bitspower fittings and EK blocks (does not necessarily mean best value though). all pumps are basically made by one company and rebranded, so there's no difference between an XSPC D5 and an EK D5. you can buy a single D5 and sleep soundly. Res before pump, keep in mind when planning your loop!   Hope that helps, feel free to ask any more questions!  EDIT: Here's my build, btw."

watercooling,3av6wl,jcgill,2,Tue Jun 23 19:38:53 2015 UTC,"I recently built a custom loop and I think it's only worth it if you look at it as a project. If you just wanna assemble the loop as fast as possible and be done with it so you can reap the benefits, it won't be worth the cost. However if you think you'd enjoy the building aspect along with the increased silence, overclocking, aesthetics, and lower temps, then go for it. To be honest, with the introduction of coolers like the evga hybrid and Fury X, the gap between custom loops and their less expensive closed loops is closing. A custom loop is still better, but if you want cost-effective performance increases, you'd be better off buying a second graphics card or really nice monitor (provided you don't already have them, in which case a custom loop would be the next step)."

I'd have to buy so many new parts and sell so many of my current ones that it'd just be a pain, not to mention it can only fit a 240mm rad.

watercooling,3av6wl,anotheraznguy,1 point,Wed Jun 24 03:59:25 2015 UTC,I am running a Define S as well with a full loop.  What type of temps are you currently seeing w/ the D15 and what cpu?  Also the different in temps between a EVGA hybrid and Custom cooler won't be that much. It really depends on your rad setup and fan capacity  For instance. My build has low speed fans. Sub 800 rpm at idle and low computer and at full speed maxes out at 1500  The noise level is quiet with the loudest piece being my PSU fan  i have a 5820k @ 1.32 V and 2 980 Ti's at 1.23V Gpu temps are 50 at load and CPU is 60

watercooling,3av6wl,anotheraznguy,1 point,Tue Jun 23 20:17:00 2015 UTC,"Only you can decide. Can you build a quieter system? Yes.   Do you want to do maintenance every 6-9 months?   Temperature wise, you will be able to OC your CPU slightly more than what you have w/ your D15 if you are comfortable pushing some voltage through it. Hybrid Vs EK would be about the same in terms of OC potential."

watercooling,3av6wl,Aparks89,1 point,Wed Jun 24 00:35:30 2015 UTC,For the most part its just drain-flush-fill. However if there is any issues then you would need to take the loop apart. Also if you are OCD and stare are your pc as much as you look at your monitor then you may be pulling it apart to change the loop order or redoing some lines. But at that point its all aesthetics.

watercooling,3attmz,kevzhu,1 point,Tue Jun 23 16:55:33 2015 UTC,"Depends on what you want to accomplish. Are you doing full system liquid or GPU only?  240mm rad is good for 1 GPU, OC or not, as long as it is not overvolted majorly. General rule of thumb is 120mm rad per liquid cooling component + an extra 120mm rad for headroom. So 1 GPU = 240mm rad 2 GPU = 360mm rad CPU + GPU = 480mm rad etc."

watercooling,3attmz,kevzhu,1 point,Tue Jun 23 18:20:03 2015 UTC,"If youre planning on 1 GPU + 1 CPU you'll need roughly 360mm equivalent of rad or more, this can be split up into multiple rads or all in 1 long rad. If you want to add a 2nd GPU you'll need 480mm equivalent rad space - I run 1 CPU + 2 GPUS with 480mm total (1 360mm and 1 120mm) and cooling is perfect, I'm overvolting things too.  At this rate I would probably go custom loop, unless you don't like tweaking / parts planning / compatibility research, then go for a kit."

watercooling,3arvo5,aspre777,2,Tue Jun 23 03:45:33 2015 UTC,"Not sure what you mean by ""combine"". You can run them off of the same power supply cable, if that cable has two female Molex connectors (most do). I guess you could combine them using a Y-cable then run them off of one Molex female connector, but there's no reason to do that if you have two available (most power supplies do)."
watercooling,3arvo5,SeaJayCJ,2,Tue Jun 23 03:35:09 2015 UTC,Simple answer- yes. You can even cut and splice the two yellows and the two blacks to one molex connector.  you can get a molex splitter if you are too lazy to cut cables.
watercooling,3arvo5,Fifthdread,1 point,Tue Jun 23 12:54:52 2015 UTC,I prefer this method over the seperate connector because of clearance.
watercooling,3arvo5,PromileSuccessor,1 point,Wed Jun 24 16:50:46 2015 UTC,I did it myself- but not with molex connectors. I spliced together 8 120mm fans to one 3 pin connector. to save space- and to allow my fan controller to control my 8 fans on my main radiator with one knob.
watercooling,3arvo5,Fifthdread,1 point,Wed Jun 24 16:52:52 2015 UTC,"Yes this is what I did too, however just with 3 fans and mine are powered by molex. Speed is regulated with only one fan header."
watercooling,3arvo5,PromileSuccessor,-6,Wed Jun 24 16:56:16 2015 UTC,The yellow line is to carry +12v. The molex connector those hook up to only has one +12V line. I would not recommend trying to drive them both off a single +12V line in a connector.
watercooling,3arvo5,herminzerah,5,Tue Jun 23 01:07:40 2015 UTC,"There is no reason he couldn't. It isn't like it magically changes the load. 15w x 2 is still 30w either way using 1 or 2 connectors. Now this is assuming that the wire can handle it which it should be able to no problem but if OP could state the AWG we would know for sure. Now if he means take the two pins from one and add it to the other connector then no, unless of course he wanted one running at 5v. Not a good idea if it is the same loop, if it is a separate one then sure go for it."
watercooling,3arvo5,DarkStarrFOFF,1 point,Tue Jun 23 02:48:52 2015 UTC,"My concern was shitty wire. Now if it's more than a low enough gauge there's no actual reason why it wouldn't work. As long as he is jumping the 12V for consolidating to one connector. Not sure which pumps these are and I haven't researched them much but I would assume based on your comment it wouldn't actually be a problem to run it at 5V except that it would probably push less water?  Edit: Though derping on context, I doubt his PSU has super high gauge wire so yah, he can reliably draw the power for two pumps off the one 12V line, just need to make his own connector I guess. Not sure if any already exist jumping the 12V line to another socket giving you the ability to power both through the same connector. I paid frigin $1.24 for a right angle through hole peripheral header for my fan controller I am making, non-headers are probably cheaper though. Though with watercooling cheaping out is usually the worst idea, right?"
watercooling,3arvo5,herminzerah,1 point,Tue Jun 23 03:27:15 2015 UTC,"The amps going through is what matters. The maximum pump current is 1.5A, so 3A for two, which is no problem for standard copper wire, even if it were something tiny as 22ga."
watercooling,3aryba,lady_bait,3,Tue Jun 23 00:56:23 2015 UTC,"I do believe most people will use a reamer for cleaning the edges of tubing. I suppose you could use a rotary tool or plain, old fashioned sand paper as well."
watercooling,3aryba,moto_bandit,1 point,Tue Jun 23 01:15:05 2015 UTC,I have the reamer but do i need to round the edges apart from that??
watercooling,3aryba,moto_bandit,2,Tue Jun 23 01:22:52 2015 UTC,a reamer should take most of the sharp edge off. If you're still concerned after you get it reamed just take some fine grit sand paper to it. Remember to rinse before you install them tubing to get any residue off!
watercooling,3aryba,nono0044,1 point,Tue Jun 23 01:26:43 2015 UTC,ok thanks! as for cutting do you have a recommended cutting tool? I was just going to get a hacksaw off of amazon.
watercooling,3aryba,larainzlo07,1 point,Tue Jun 23 01:27:36 2015 UTC,It's also a good idea to get a mitre block to keep everything in in place while you cut and to get cleaner cuts.

watercooling,3arfkg,Karavusk,4,Mon Jun 22 22:57:38 2015 UTC,"You did, the addition of the water block to the weight of the gpu often leads to sagging.

watercooling,3aqtoc,doprahwinfreyIII,3,Mon Jun 22 19:35:12 2015 UTC,"Yes, its recommended to use a thermal compound on the gpu processor. The pads are for things on the card that that are below the waterblock's contact level. They bridge the space."
watercooling,3aqtoc,Well_ventilated_Area,5,Mon Jun 22 19:47:24 2015 UTC,"Also I would add to really read the directions, or look them up for your blocks, they should specify what to do."
watercooling,3aqtoc,Well_ventilated_Area,3,Mon Jun 22 19:48:04 2015 UTC,"Depending on the block it may come with tim for the cpu and pads for the vrm's and what not. When I ordered mine from ek it did. I wouldn't suggest using the cpu tim on the gpu just because a lot of the time GPU's have components very close by and as such need a tim that doesn't conduct electricity. Also a lot of the time pads are used for vrms to overcome space that tim just can't, because of how some blocks are setup. I would suggest looking into a specific block for your card and generally they will suggest a certain thickness for your pads, or they will have a suggested tim."
watercooling,3aqtoc,dtaivp,1 point,Mon Jun 22 23:04:12 2015 UTC,"Sure, you definitely need to use TIM and not pads.  Don't use Arctic Silver 5, there are much better alternatives out there.  MX-4 is a good all-around inexpensive TIM.  Consider using what ever comes with your block as sometimes they use great products and you know they will perform well."

watercooling,3aqa5m,niceandcreamy,1 point,Mon Jun 22 17:22:32 2015 UTC,"Right now I'm just trying to get an idea of cost and and understanding of everything in general.  When I decide to go through with it, though, yes bending hardline or nothing.  Goals in mind: Not extremely concerned with performance, obviously expect better than stock air fans etc. but not trying to enter a competition for temps, ability to run the fans very quietly (I plan to put money into nice fans), and have as much exposed blocks (not sure what to call it?) where you can see the coolant as possible."
watercooling,3aqa5m,niceandcreamy,2,Mon Jun 22 17:24:38 2015 UTC,You will have plenty of radiator space to make a nice cool and quiet build.
watercooling,3aqa5m,niceandcreamy,1 point,Mon Jun 22 18:38:57 2015 UTC,"thanks for the responses, hope I'm not bothering you too much!  how well does it work? I know that they recommend like 120 for every part + an extra 120. So does overkill dual 480s actually allow you to go super light on the fan rpm while maintaining cool parts?"
watercooling,3aqa5m,niceandcreamy,2,Mon Jun 22 18:45:29 2015 UTC,No problem at all! And yes you can get really quiet and cool builds by just going way overkill on the radiator capacity. With that amount of headroom I'm sure you can have your fans completely off when you are browsing the internet or watching a movie. If you get some <20dB fans even when they are at full RPM you shouldn't hear a thing. Noiseblocker makes really nice fans that are whisper quiet.
watercooling,3aqa5m,Sorabella,1 point,Mon Jun 22 19:13:55 2015 UTC,oh wow! I was actually wondering if 0rpm idle was possible. I assume a d5 pump would be fine with dual 480 rads? Or is it just the length of tubing that matters?

If I'm going to spend that much money, I'd go with the guys who are renowned for building sturdy,  WC-friendly, customizable cases.   My biggest concern with this case are the front-side drive bays. It doesn't appear that they are fully removable to the point where you could re-use that space for a radiator, reservoir, pump, etc. So unless you actually have (what, 16? 20?) drives, it's a pretty big waste of case space. If I'm mistaken, however, than that front area would be a nice place for your res/pump or a big 360/420 rad."

The one that annoys me the most (as I seem to be in that area the most) is the strange lip they put on the rear that makes it nearly impossible to get your hand at the rear end of a GPU.  It's positioned in such a way so you cant use a screwdriver on the expansion slot screws... nor can you angle your hand in there to use thumbscrews effectively.  If you remove the crossbrace (as you do when you take out the HDD bays) then the case seems to sag in half and the lower doors don't close... so don't plan on taking it out so you can install a large tube res...

I had temp warnings enabled (and no speaker), but not shutdown, it randomly became very choppy during a game, and my attempts to figure out why were unsuccessful, so I rebooted, and got a warning from the bios that it had detected above normal temps on previous shutdown. The choppiness was the cpu throttling itself to keep from overheating."

watercooling,3alqqx,fooz20,2,Sun Jun 21 14:29:53 2015 UTC,"How does having 2 pumps benefit a loop, do they only benefit very large loops? What are some speeds that can be achieved with water cooling (for example 3.7gHz-4.7Ghz) I know it varies from CPU to CPU, but I just want a ballpark number. On very thick radiators like the monsta is there a large benefit of running push/pull setups with the fans."
watercooling,3alqqx,Boy1998,3,Sun Jun 21 14:37:27 2015 UTC,2 pumps provide a better flow if your loop is restrictive.  CPU temps are based upon silicon lottery and temps. If you have only 120mm your temps aren't going to be fantastic when overclocked. But I'm sure you can push a 4690k from 3.5 to 4.7 no prob with 240mm and have good temps.  Dazmode (Canadian watercooling store and YouTuber) made some tests about rads. I'll give some points he made.   Thickness doesn't matter too much. Only a 1-2 degree difference. Push vs pull vs push/pull doesn't matter. Push/pull only increases cooling by 1-2 degrees. Push/pull is mainly for looks. High FPI rads are a waste. They trap dust too easily and make it hard to clean. Get some mid range rads (12-17 FPI I guess).    The most important thing is to get as much rad space as possible and you'll be good.
watercooling,3alqqx,specikk,3,Sun Jun 21 16:04:08 2015 UTC,"There are three reasons why you'd run a dual pump setup:    Two separate loops within the same machine. Normally this is done for extreme overclocking of CPUs / GPUs to keep each overclocked component on it's own loop with separate reservoir, radiators etc.  As a redundancy just in case one pump in your loop fails, the other prevents any components from overheating. This is not a good reason to go with a dual pump setup though as any watercooled system should have appropriate temperature and flow rate monitoring via Aquaero etc. For more head pressure or higher flow rate. If you setup your pumps in parallel, you'll achieve more flow rate. In a series configuration, you'll achieve more head pressure. Would be for machines with very large loops or situations where flow rate is restricted because of the number of blocks, fittings, etc.    In most loops, a dual pump is not worth the added cost. It won't make any noticeable difference to your component temperatures. It's where the concept of diminishing returns comes into play. It's usually better to invest in a really good single pump like a D5 instead.  About radiator thickness:   The amount of cooling in a watercooled system directly relates to the amount of radiator space available to dissipate heat in your coolant as it travels through your loop. It is typically preferred to have a radiator with a medium FPI (fins per inch) ratio. This provides enough surface area for the coolant to run through and dissipate heat but also doesn't trap dust as easily as higher FPI. Ultra thick radiators like the Monsta obviously have a great deal more surface area so heat dissipation will be better. However, there is a gotcha here.   The thicker the radiator is, the more air pressure your radiator fans have to generate to push air through it. A Monsta radiator will definitely need a push/pull configuration to be efficient at cooling and you'll also want high quality fans otherwise fan noise becomes even more of a factor.   I personally don't like ultra thick radiators, they take up a lot of case space and tend to make a system noisy because of the increased fan speeds needed. They also don't make that much of a difference in cooling performance.  A general rule is to have at least 120mm of radiator space per watercooled component. If any of these are overclocked, you probably want to double that number.   About CPU overclocking:   This really is a tough thing to even ballpark as it really does vary between CPU types. It even varies based on the individual chip you end up getting in the box. Some call this the ""silicon lottery""-- some are more tolerant of overclocking than others.   But in general, if you're lucky, on a decent Intel chip (I don't know about AMD, don't use them) you may be able to get somewhere in the neighborhood of 1.5 GHz over the stock speed. More than that and you have to crank up the voltage going to the CPU past what it's rated for which will ultimately result in damage to the CPU over time. Some people achieve extreme CPU overclocks of 5.0GHz+ but these results aren't typical and you have to know exactly what you're doing to prevent frying your CPU.   Even with watercooling, CPUs can run really hot at high overclocks. So you'll need even more radiator space and fans if you're looking to go extreme. If you're in the market for a new CPU, I'd do a bunch of research into which processor series are the friendliest for overclocking. You'll want to find a balance of clock speed, temperatures, and fan speeds. Again, diminishing returns is a factor here. I personally am on Haswell-E and was able to get a nice stable 4.2GHz overclock on a 5820k 6-core chip.   Hope this helps!"
watercooling,3alqqx,StellaTerra,1 point,Sun Jun 21 16:10:26 2015 UTC,"Is it really necessary to have a reservoir/t-line? Can't you submerge the loop and fill it closed? Are there any guides for this? If I move a system with a t-line or reservoir and it tips sideways, will I have to re-bleed it? Is that not a problem with closed loops?"
watercooling,3alqqx,Alestor,1 point,Sun Jun 21 16:54:26 2015 UTC,"It sounds like an unbelievable pain in the ass to fill a loop submerged outside of the case and install it filled. You'll need a ton of excess coolant as well to submerge it, and trying to fill another way is likely to leave bubbles. Though it's not impossible, it'll save you a huge headache to just get a reservoir or t-line  A system with a t-line or reservoir shouldn't have enough air in it once bled to have it get back in the loop easily (assuming you fill it up almost all the way), I wouldn't worry about tipping the case reintroducing air into the tube unless you flip it on its head for some reason.  Closed loops always have a little air in them since mass production isn't flawless and they skip on the reservoir, so you can't bleed it in the first place"
watercooling,3alqqx,StellaTerra,1 point,Sun Jun 21 20:54:55 2015 UTC,"I mean... how much should I care about excess coolant...? It's not like it's a big waste of money. http://www.walmart.com/ip/Great-Value-Distilled-Water-1-Gal/10315382  I hadn't thought to submerge the whole thing, that seems like a good call.  Will that do damage to the pump if it's submerged and powered/turned on?  I had been assuming I would only need to submerge a portion of the loop, but it sounds like you're saying that's not practical.  My plan/hope was to use a cpu block/pump combo and no res/t-line for an ultra simple custom loop with 3 ""stops"".  I'm not sure why but I just really hate air traps, I'd rather just do it right initially and deal with the air ahead of time, if that's at all practical. Are there any guides on this bleeding style?"
watercooling,3alqqx,Alestor,1 point,Sun Jun 21 23:39:11 2015 UTC,"Any parts not submerged will have trouble bleeding air, though I suppose you could manage it as long as they were below the source of water, you could fill up a tube that isn't attached to prime the loop, but again, it'd be hard to make sure no air was still in the tubes when you closed the loop which is why AIO's always have air trapped in them.   The thing about the coolant for a submerge strategy, is you're going to need an appropriate level of biocide with the amount of distilled water, especially since you could be introducing contaminants into the water with the oils on your hand just handling it. Throwing out an arbitrary number, lets say you need 30 liters to fill a tub enough to submerge all your components to fill, thats 15 bottles of Dazmode Protector (what I use), coming to about 110$ USD in biocide. Thats way more than the cost of a T-line so just don't bother with this train of thought at all. For partial submersion you'd still need much more coolant than you'd otherwise need.  You also raise a good point about the pump, I'm not sure if standard pumps are submersible but I doubt they are. This was all just the way I thought this could be handled so I don't know if anyone actually does it since I've never seen a loop filled without a res or t-line  Also keep in mind that any custom loop is going to need to be cleaned at some point, even with biocide. Coolant only lasts so long before getting mucky, so you're going to need to fill it again eventually and go through it again.  My suggestion if you really don't want a res or t-line is a radiator with a drain port (example), and use it as a fill port, it'll accomplish the same thing as a t-line really, though there will probably still be a small amount of air in it when its plugged off unfortunately"
watercooling,3alqqx,StellaTerra,1 point,Mon Jun 22 00:43:31 2015 UTC,"Hmmm, I think the radiator with the drain port seems like a reasonable idea.

The other solution I came across was this, but there are literally no reviews of it anywhere! http://www.swiftech.com/MCR140-X.aspx  I certainly wouldn't use a biocide additive.

The way I see it a d5 will be able to include my CPU in the future, so it's a little overkill for 960s but opens the door to a full loop later with just a little more tubing, block and larger rad."
watercooling,3alqqx,Kautkto,1 point,Tue Jun 23 00:44:08 2015 UTC,"I have 960mm radiator space total, although admittedly 360mm cooled all 3 components (with a thicker radiator and louder fans) but couldn't cope with any sort of overclock.   As long as your gpus don't pass 80c while gaming it's all good.   You'd be better off with a better card anyway, the 960 was always lacklustre. (sell the cards, use money on a 980ti)  Just saw your edit, I suggest get the larger radiator now. Still reckon that putting 960s in a loop is silly, and you should go for something that'll support a full cover block at least."

watercooling,3aj23w,adog12341,6,Sat Jun 20 17:56:29 2015 UTC,"That right there is one of the reasons I went rigid tubing (e-peen/aesthetic being the others).  Copper is an easier alternative to acrylic, and is more forgiving of slight mistakes in your bends."

watercooling,3aj23w,TurboGLH,3,Sat Jun 20 22:04:07 2015 UTC,"The unforgiving nature is the major factor that steered me away from acrylic. Also, I like the industrial look of copper more, and you can get the tubing at any home improvement place if you need to make any changes to your loop."

The case is a 750D with the 5.25"" bays removed and blanking plates on most of the honeycomb. Now that it is a reality and I know what goes where I can tear the whole thing apart. I have to clean it, paint it, wire it, light it, and finish my custom front plate.   The weird valve at the bottom of the vertical radiator is to make draining very simple because I plan to use this loop for a few upgrades."

I have one of the correct lengths cut so I just have to duplicate it but there is little room in the fitting for mistakes. I didn't want to spend time on it just to tear it apart. And the loop order is pump>gpus>cpu>ram>rad>rad>res

watercooling,3afeni,Andrej_ID,3,Fri Jun 19 18:43:42 2015 UTC,Keep the kidney. Maybe you get one Vulture ;) just make sure you follow us!
watercooling,3afeni,Kinaestheticsz,3,Fri Jun 19 19:10:15 2015 UTC,Y'all really need to come up with a way to produce that case en-mass for the market. I've been definitely wanting this product ever since you guys took the wraps off of it.

watercooling,3afeni,Nyxi26,1 point,Fri Jun 19 21:18:28 2015 UTC,"Thanks! It was a team effort between myself and a couple other guys. The Vulture is a wonderful chassis! A bit over-sized for mini-ITX (though I'm sure you've seen the mATX mod that B-Negative did to his), but it screams high quality in its materials and construction.   It's up to EK what they want to do with these cases, I've seen a few more modders gifted their own Vulture chassis when the initial Mod-Off was wrapping up, so who knows?"
watercooling,3afeni,BuildYourComputer,1 point,Fri Jun 19 18:55:40 2015 UTC,Well you certainly did it justice - the theming and attention to detail on that build is just about perfect. Congrats to you and the team!
watercooling,3afeni,BuildYourComputer,3,Fri Jun 19 19:08:22 2015 UTC,I love what you did to the ram. I'd like to do something similar in red. How did you go about disassembling your ram?
watercooling,3afeni,BuildYourComputer,1 point,Sat Jun 20 04:36:46 2015 UTC,"Good question! For the RAM in this particular build (Avexir Core Series), the two sides of the heat spreader are held on by adhesive. A heatgun set to low and a guitar pick (or other plastic prying tool) made short work of that, just take your time with it. From there it's just pick a color and paint to your heart's content!"
watercooling,3afeni,s4in7,2,Sat Jun 20 14:34:31 2015 UTC,Awesome! How about reassembly? I have some slight experience with reassembling a heatsink on ram.
watercooling,3afeni,s4in7,2,Sat Jun 20 16:56:08 2015 UTC,"Depending on how thorough of a paint job you do (if you paint the outside and inside of the heat spreader), you can either reattach the thermal pads and re-use them if you didn't mess them up too bad when you removed them, or get new thermal pads and stick the heat spreaders back on the RAM. The Core Series modules also have a plastic light bar that's held in place solely by the heat spreaders' top clips, so you may have to align everything just right."
watercooling,3afeni,paradox4286,2,Sat Jun 20 17:18:03 2015 UTC,"Damn, the tips of mine are already different, I don't know of I can handle different height of the lights haha."
watercooling,3afeni,s4in7,1 point,Sat Jun 20 17:24:07 2015 UTC,"Well the light bar on the Core Series sits directly on top of the RAM itself, so it's just a matter of lining up the heat spreaders to make sure they're even when you re-install them. The lights shouldn't be at different heights."
watercooling,3afeni,rawwrX3,2,Sat Jun 20 17:48:18 2015 UTC,Awesome build! As a native San Antonio computer enthusiast I wish Altex would fix their terrible pricing though. I was in there yesterday and they're still selling a 290X for $600 :/ Their markups on processors is just as terrible. We don't have a Fry's so our local options for hardware are limited to Allgen and Altex. Oh well.
watercooling,3afeni,rawwrX3,2,Fri Jun 19 22:34:18 2015 UTC,"Thanks! It was a blast to work on! Also, I can't say much, but pricing is sometimes determined by vendor support. It's something that's being worked on, but it's an uphill battle. When a store buys X units at Y price from a vendor then the vendor decides to drop the price for other (bigger) competing stores (telling the original store SOL), it leaves a lot of stale stock at less than stellar pricing. It doesn't happen all the time, but it does happen."
watercooling,3afeni,Ejekt,1 point,Fri Jun 19 23:31:19 2015 UTC,Fair enough! I still support the store regularly though. Just bought an S340 not too long ago ☺
watercooling,3afeni,Nin10dork99,2,Sat Jun 20 00:51:34 2015 UTC,Allgen has more knowledgeable people. I was happier to buy my parts there. I am not a fan of Altex. I'm willing to wait for Amazon 2 day shipping to sometimes save 50%. They make their money off naïve. They're still around so there must be plenty of those locally.

watercooling,3ai7c3,Karavusk,3,Sat Jun 20 12:34:02 2015 UTC,You need to cool vrm to the core. That gets really hot.
watercooling,3ai7c3,TheImmortalLS,2,Sat Jun 20 14:01:17 2015 UTC,"Why not just, you know, buy the version which already comes with an AIO (Fury X)? Why bother putting your own on?   And no, you'll still need to cool VRM."
watercooling,3ai7c3,SeaJayCJ,3,Sat Jun 20 15:46:38 2015 UTC,I was just wondering. I will stay with my watercooled 970 but thanks good to know
watercooling,3ai7c3,willdenham,1 point,Sat Jun 20 15:52:22 2015 UTC,"The other thing AMD hasn't confirmed (adding to the laundry list that's a cluster f*** of a launch) is that the Fury really is equal to the Fury X. Is the Fury X just overclocked due to liquid cooling, or are they fundamentally different or at least binned differently?  $100 difference, and the fact that they are named differently, makes me highly skeptical."
watercooling,3ai7c3,filipino_amigo,2,Sat Jun 20 17:51:07 2015 UTC,"If their naming scheme for X cards holds true. Fury X will likely be fully enabled, while Fury will have some features cut down.

watercooling,3ai7c3,herminzerah,1 point,Sat Jun 20 18:36:25 2015 UTC,Somewhere I saw a report saying the Fury is slightly handicapped compared to the Fury X but can easily be as fast with some over clocking like the 290/290x and 980ti/titan x.  Naturally this could be wrong though.
watercooling,3ai7c3,Call_Me_ZeeKay,1 point,Sat Jun 20 23:28:12 2015 UTC,My question is whats going to be the easiest to get in an existing loop.  Probably would need to wait for the Fury (non-X) and then add an aftermarket block. No sense in buying the X and throwing the stock AIO away.
watercooling,3ahxkn,Swiggety666,4,Sat Jun 20 09:59:48 2015 UTC,I think I'll need more of them so my 760T doesn't look empty.
watercooling,3ahxkn,El-Grunto,3,Sat Jun 20 11:42:14 2015 UTC,"On a purely aesthetics thing I think it looks bad due to its short length.  I think we've all got used to seeing the cables come out at the far edge just where the motherboard ends and having it wrapped nicely into a cutout in the case and behind the motherboard. Now the cables will drape across and not look as good.  Now having said that, is this the end of the world? No. Would it stop me buying a Fury X or two? No. It won't look as good but that doesn't mean the card is ruined or anything like that.  Now on the other hand I'm sure many of us have wanted or have already completed some ITX builds. There are more ITX cases now than ever and some of them look amazing, this card would really feel at home in those kinds of builds and deliver what will be some jaw dropping performance while doing so.  I personally am not going to be buying any new graphics this year as I already upgraded recently but I think Fury X shows some good innovation with HBM and although I think the shortness is unappealing aesthetics wise that's only really true for certain builds, larger builds like my own."
watercooling,3ahxkn,i_mormon_stuff,2,Sat Jun 20 11:50:05 2015 UTC,"I love the idea of tiny cards. I have a super cramped case and having short cards means I'll be able to use a tube res/pump combo.   Would longer cards be better for aesthetics and e-peen? Yeah, probably."

watercooling,3ag435,jinxnotit,1 point,Sat Jun 20 04:51:55 2015 UTC,"You'll probably be able to remove the AIO if you're that concerned about binning, they'll likely have the same PCB. As for using the builtin block, maybe but it'll take some modding."
watercooling,3ag435,Techonup,1 point,Fri Jun 19 21:48:00 2015 UTC,I don't know what metal it will be made out of but a lot of AIO's use aluminum in the loops. A custom block will perform much better anyway if you're spending that much on a card.
watercooling,3ag435,niceandcreamy,1 point,Fri Jun 19 23:45:33 2015 UTC,I wonder if there would be any market for the AIO if I was to take it off and sell it. At least I could then put that towards a custom block.

watercooling,3aeg1w,herminzerah,3,Fri Jun 19 23:22:40 2015 UTC,"PWM is duty cycle. It's a percentage, 0-100 thats related to how long the 'ON' signal is sent to the fan. In theory 50% will spin a fan at 50% of it's rated max speed but no motor is perfect. So yes"

watercooling,3aeg1w,jinxnotit,2,Sat Jun 20 02:36:46 2015 UTC,How do you calculate your pump flow requirements for your loop?
watercooling,3aeg1w,niceandcreamy,2,Fri Jun 19 17:56:04 2015 UTC,Unless you have triple or quad GPUs and 4 radiators a D5 or DDC pump will be sufficient. The D5 is larger but quieter.
watercooling,3aeg1w,jinxnotit,1 point,Sat Jun 20 01:36:25 2015 UTC,I'm going to be using 2 Phobya Xtreme 200mm rads for a 295X2 and a 5930K.  Are those enough? And are they PWM controlled?
watercooling,3aeg1w,niceandcreamy,3,Sat Jun 20 02:18:40 2015 UTC,Yea they have plenty of power and will last you years. Don't get the PWM D5 as its really a gimmick and the vario(variable speed) is a much better value. With the D5 you can set it at whatever is quiet in your build and leave it there. The DDC pwm is a bit more useful as you can make it less noisy.

watercooling,3aeg1w,ktmfinx,1 point,Fri Jun 19 15:28:40 2015 UTC,"This actually solely depends on whether those components have corroded or not.

watercooling,3aeg1w,niceandcreamy,1 point,Fri Jun 19 18:44:59 2015 UTC,Unless you have universal GPU blocks you will need to get new ones of those but everything else in the loop can be cleaned and reused.
watercooling,3aeg1w,eatingcarbs,1 point,Sat Jun 20 01:31:25 2015 UTC,"How do you make a decision on whether or not it's worth it to full cover your current card?  I have a 290 now, not sure if i should sell and upgrade + cool that, or just do the current card and save a lot of money.  And I feel that I can probably live with that until next gen at a res of only 2560x1080 (21:9).  Do you find its hard to sell old waterblocks?"
watercooling,3aeg1w,niceandcreamy,2,Fri Jun 19 16:27:48 2015 UTC,Well if you're satisfied with your current card there is no reason to upgrade. Once its underwater you can overclock it a bit more as well so take that into account. As for selling waterblocks? Its really a hit or miss. Usually the easiest way is just to sell the block and card as a combo.
watercooling,3aeddu,saintartsflow,5,Fri Jun 19 13:06:00 2015 UTC,Not required but it sure makes it easy to drain your loop when it's time to clean or change the fluid
watercooling,3aeddu,TinyRumchata,3,Fri Jun 19 13:31:24 2015 UTC,"Others have already said how it's unnecessary but recommended to save the headache when draining, so I'll just share what I did.  My loop has a 3 way splitter coming out of the pump head at the lowest part of the loop. Connected is the line to the GPU, a temp sensor, and a male quick disconnect. I have the female QDC attached to a few feet of spare tubing which I just plug in when I need to drain. I upgraded to a 980ti recently and draining the loop this way took 2 minutes, just pop the reservoir fill plug off to let air in and it drains 98% of the water"
watercooling,3aeddu,Alestor,2,Sat Jun 20 08:21:32 2015 UTC,"Necessary?  No, but damn useful, though.  I screwed my radiator to the outside of my case, so when I want to drain, I just disconnect the fittings with no worry.  But if your whole loop is inside the case, you may have to tip the case 45° and get some towels up in there and deal with that hassle when you want to drain.  A draining port is really just for your convenience."
watercooling,3aeddu,Dubhe14,2,Fri Jun 19 14:46:48 2015 UTC,"Unless you are strong enough to pick up your whole computer and flip it around, add a drain."
watercooling,3aeddu,BanginBanana,2,Fri Jun 19 16:54:54 2015 UTC,"As the others have said, not strictly necessary but HIGHLY recommended.  As for which one, simple ball valves are what I normally use, like this $9 Phobya model.  Put it in the lowest possible point in your loop and you'll thank yourself the first time you have to drain it."
watercooling,3aeddu,Retrosmith,1 point,Sat Jun 20 07:34:00 2015 UTC,"Having some dedicated method for draining a loop is recommended. I used a T line in the past, recently bought a valve to reduce tubing in the case as I moved to a smaller one."
watercooling,3aeddu,herminzerah,1 point,Fri Jun 19 13:26:29 2015 UTC,"Either a valve or in my case I used some Koolance quick disconnects on my pump/res. Draining the loop is as easy as popping the pump output off and plugging a spare length of hose there instead (obviously you need a spare quick disconnect as well). More expensive than a valve to do it this way, though."

watercooling,3abi7p,outsidephone,1 point,Fri Jun 19 13:14:33 2015 UTC,Yes I did. Was pretty easy to do. I bought everything from mainframecustoms.
watercooling,3abi7p,outsidephone,6,Fri Jun 19 13:25:02 2015 UTC,Damn that looks great. Was it hard to get the acrylic bends in that tiny case? All the rigid builds I've seen are done in huge cases.
watercooling,3abi7p,iamgmolnar,5,Thu Jun 18 19:37:56 2015 UTC,"Hey thanks. Yea I had a tough time initially trying to figure out how to bend the tubing well. I'm actually using PETG. I started off with acrylic and switched to PETG which is easier to work with. It's cheaper as well.  Once I got the hang of it I did the last three pieces without messing up but it certainly would be a lot easier in a larger case. I really like the NCASE M1, it's very well thought out and getting both a full sized GPU and radiator into it is amazing."
watercooling,3abi7p,endoughy,2,Thu Jun 18 19:40:22 2015 UTC,Where did you buy it and how did you bend the tubing?
watercooling,3abi7p,endoughy,4,Thu Jun 18 20:16:54 2015 UTC,"Not quite sure what you're asking here.  I purchased the NCASE M1 directly from ncase.   The tubing was purchased from Amazon, just look up Primochill PETG tubing. They have quite a few colors and it comes in 3ft lengths. I think I got four 3ft pieces for ~16$.  Bending is fairly straight forward. There are a number of guides on youtube to do it. It just takes some practice and you're going to mess up some pieces while learning. Once you figure out the ideal temp to heat the tube to and get a feel for how it reacts to bending you will crank out your pieces pretty fast."
watercooling,3abi7p,iamgmolnar,1 point,Thu Jun 18 20:19:55 2015 UTC,"if you could guestimate, roughly how many feet of tubing did you for the entire build?  It's just astounding, and makes me happy as hell to know I can do something similar with mine!  Nicely done OP"
watercooling,3abi7p,willemdoom,2,Thu Jun 18 22:58:39 2015 UTC,If all you want is clear you can order is from McMasterCarr. I just got two 6' sticks of 1/2'' x 5/8'' for $18. So now I have 12 ft which should be enough for me to mess up multiple times or if I want to change my loop around in the future.
watercooling,3abi7p,willemdoom,2,Fri Jun 19 00:03:38 2015 UTC,Shipping at McMaster for long tubes kills I've found. Done some other projects and will spend 15$ on a product and 15$ for shipping when it's a bigger package.  The primochill stuff is also 12ft total for 16$ and free shipping if you have amazon prime.
watercooling,3abi7p,willemdoom,1 point,Fri Jun 19 00:06:40 2015 UTC,Ah ok.  I'm like 15 min from McMasterCarr. And anytime I've ordered stuff from them shipping has been free for me.

watercooling,3abi7p,Funchilly,2,Fri Jun 19 14:44:59 2015 UTC,What do you think of the weird angles on the apogee's in/outlet ports? That's my one big gripe about it.
watercooling,3abi7p,PrometheusHD,2,Thu Jun 18 20:50:24 2015 UTC,"Man that was the hardest part. Not only are the weird angles, they aren't even. The out protrudes ~1/4inch further then the in port does. I had to put it on the angled setting otherwise it would bump into the radiator fan with the bitspower 90 degree fitting.  They could certainly improve that, there is plenty of room to both make it lower setting and not be an odd angle."
watercooling,3adnmy,Nicholas_Spawn,3,Fri Jun 19 07:08:31 2015 UTC,The only reason I get nickel blocks is because EK thought it would be a great idea not to make copper blocks for my GPUs.   No reason at all to use nickel blocks.
watercooling,3adnmy,Sorabella,2,Fri Jun 19 08:18:57 2015 UTC,"You have to use the classy ones?  I wasn't a fan of those either.

Ended up ordering 2 superclocked plus 980ti from EVGA.  They use the same block as the titan x (refrence)"
watercooling,3adnmy,Makirole,2,Fri Jun 19 09:18:51 2015 UTC,Yeah it's basically an aesthetics point.  I choose nickel because I think copper looks hideous outside a select few scenarios
watercooling,3adnmy,DarkStarrFOFF,1 point,Fri Jun 19 08:21:37 2015 UTC,IMO I think copper looks nice just not EK copper. Reason being they don't put anything on it to prevent the exterior from going old penny color. No lacquer means they tarnish super easily. My heatkiller had all outer facing copper lacquered so it stayed nice and coppery.
watercooling,3adnmy,Makirole,2,Fri Jun 19 17:46:39 2015 UTC,"Unless I'm doing a copper themed build with lots of deep reds/Browns or some sort of steampunk thing, I will always choose nickel.  I know this is dodgy ground, but personally I think heatkiller blocks are hideous for the most part.  Whilst I think Aquacomputer's ones look great, again I would always go nickel over their copper one."

watercooling,3adoqp,Kautkto,1 point,Fri Jun 19 07:27:19 2015 UTC,It was just the other day it felt like the tube from the GPU to the first rad was not warm at all... The block was medium warm to upper warm... But I felt like flow might have been part of the issue? all the rads were room temp and I was going full tilt gaming overclocked stable good temps.... I still feel like the pipe from the GPUs to the first rad should have been warmer? It's likely because I am only running one GPU ATM (getting an RMA that comes in tomorrow... back to crossfire!!!!!) instead of 2?
watercooling,3adoqp,Kautkto,1 point,Fri Jun 19 07:32:49 2015 UTC,Get an inline temp sensor to be sure. Pipe temps won't tell you anything.
watercooling,3adoqp,Spider-One,1 point,Fri Jun 19 07:39:06 2015 UTC,"Low flow would have the opposite effect and would cause the temp rise across each block to increase. Increasing flow will further lower the temp change across each component as the water spends less time in the component due to increased velocity. Flow rates too high can have negative effects to heat absorption and dissipation as well, though likely not enough to notice in any normal case. If you really want to know what's going on buy a flow meter."
watercooling,3acewf,eQuiFY,6,Thu Jun 18 23:37:45 2015 UTC,"Pumps are fine 24/7, one pump should be safe.  But if you do want 2, they should be as identical in flow rate and pressure as possible, and in series.  having a duty basis on the pumps is not a good idea as the pump that is off will be adding resistance.  Also as for placement for dual pumps, anywhere is ok as long as one of the pumps is right after the res  so you can prime the loop, and the pumps should not be closer than 1 ft to each other or else cavitation could happen in between them."

Most people go for any variant of the variable speed D5 (either controlled via PWM or by a small dial on the back of the pump) so they can find a sweet spot between flow rate and noise, however in my own experience I have found a D5@100% to be whisper quiet, and I run two of them in series."

watercooling,3acfb9,nono0044,1 point,Fri Jun 19 01:52:01 2015 UTC,"Just a fyi, ts not swiftech or D5.  Swiftech is a brand, and D5 is a model. You should be considering a DDC or a D5 pump.  DDC are for tight space situations and generally run hotter and louder (due to vibrations).  D5 are chunkier but are quieter. PWM pumps vary their speed based on a PWM signal from a PWM header (so software handled).  The vario ones (I think only D5 come in vario anyway) have a dial on the bottom of them so you can manually adjust the speed.  Both should be able to handle your loop."

watercooling,3aaakr,herminzerah,1 point,Thu Jun 18 19:37:19 2015 UTC,"For sure, AMD sends the reference GPU design to waterblock makers before release so they have time to design and manufacture blocks.  I bet full cover blocks will pop up on sale a couple days before the Furys hit the market.  Nothing you can do but wait for now."
watercooling,3aaakr,Dubhe14,1 point,Thu Jun 18 14:59:56 2015 UTC,"No, they don't. This is the main reason why most companies take months to have blocks ready. Some have 3D scans of the PCBs before hand from AIBs or even AMD/Nvidia sometimes which is why some blocks end up being available at launch."
watercooling,3aaakr,VSG28,1 point,Sun Jun 21 02:31:50 2015 UTC,"Since it has one from the factory, it should be easy for aftermarket to build something similar.  The only ones that may be an issue are the universal blocks."

watercooling,3aaakr,VSG28,1 point,Fri Jun 19 14:15:37 2015 UTC,It won't be easy. The VRMs are very close to the core section and this is going to be a challenge for every company. Then there's the massive core/VRAM section too. I know EK worked something out already so hopefully others follow suit.

The psu is way way way overkill for your needs, 900w will do the job just as well.   May I recommend an aquaero fan controller? it supports flow sensors, inline temp sensors, 100% software control over everything hooked to it. Can even hook your pumps to it.    As for your pump, look at the 50x, as a 35x may not do the job well enough. (The rads and your cpu block are rather restrictive)  I'd recommend a seperate pump/res combo. If you want to go bay res get the aqua computer one, or get a tube res. (Bay res with pump generate noise as it vibrates against the case. They also tend to have poor water circulation)"

Also, you will only need the heat gun and silicone insert if you plan on bending your tubing.  You can use PETG and acrylic without bending it with the right fittings.  I like bent tubing myself, but I've seen some very good-looking systems made with nothing but straight runs and fittings."

watercooling,3a9mfn,Swiggety666,1 point,Thu Jun 18 09:35:57 2015 UTC,Well I was wondering if that was an option. I'm guessing it would only make a couple of degrees difference just wanted other people opinions.
watercooling,3a9mfn,PhxkinMassacre,1 point,Thu Jun 18 09:48:54 2015 UTC,"all things considered, it won't make much difference at all not having a rear exhaust fan. having 3 140's at the top exhausting would be taking 75% of the heat anyway, without the rear exhaust they take all 100% (if you don't take mesh openings into account etc). however, having both your cpu and gpu under water, the heat will be carried by the water and not much heat at all will be dumped into the case itself from the components. so most of the heat that does enter the case is from the front rad intake but since all the water in a loop is within something like 1c of any other part of the water the heat entering should be the same as the heat in the other rad give or take regardless of rear exhaust fan or not. a rear intake would be different as it would blow cool air right infront of the exhaust rad to help temps a bit but if your temps are fine (which they will be) it is not necessary.  tl'dr doesn't matter, you still have 3 exhaust fans blowing on what dissipates most of the heat anyway (5 total fans/3 exhaust= 60%) venting right out of the case.  note - i do not have a custom loop yet as its not sensible in my current situation but to my understanding this is how it should work"

No idea, but this might help you figure it out."
watercooling,3a8fyf,miices,1 point,Thu Jun 18 05:11:17 2015 UTC,"The problem with this is somewhere you have to be taking energy out of the system.  If you don't it will overheat and/or start boiling your coolant.  If we assume the dissipated power is around 300 watts.  Using the equation mention by /u/nDQ9UeOr, and some constants/assumptions:   1 [L] of coolant = 0.001 [m3] cp of water is ~4000 [J/kg*K] water density is 1000 [kg/m3] and we overheat at 80 [C], lets assume if we go higher components would melt due to lack of heat transfer ambient temp is 25 [C]   So, it will overheat in about 12 minutes.  For every liter of water you have, it will take 12 minutes to reach 80[C].  So no it would not be logical to just use a large amount of water to cool a computer.  We could add some basic heat transfer to see if enough energy would conduct out through the reservoir walls.  But I don't feel like pulling out a textbook right now."

Whilst simply having loads of water isn't a very viable route, incorporating the radiator and the reservoir into one unit sort of is.  Basically the old Reserators that Zalman used to make.  They're not very good though, they're big and you can't see the fluid on the inside.  On the plus side, if your wattage is low enough they are passive, same sort of deal as you're proposing."

watercooling,3a8fyf,Sauce_Beier7,1 point,Thu Jun 18 08:36:05 2015 UTC,A larger reservoir would only slow the rate that the water rises in temperature because there is more water to absorb heat. That energy needs to dissipate somewhere - so the answer is no. Unless you run your computer for 10 minutes at a time - the walls of the res and tubing would not dissipate heat as fast as the components create the heat. The reservoir would have to be in the gallons to run for any length of time. And even then the temps would get too high after a while
watercooling,3a8fyf,Karavusk,1 point,Thu Jun 18 11:45:49 2015 UTC,first of all its easy to get enough radiators in order to use 0 fans but if you want no rads and no fans the only thing left for you is mineral oil cooling. Its expensive but no fans and no radiator is needed

watercooling,3a55rn,Karavusk,1 point,Wed Jun 17 11:54:17 2015 UTC,"This is what I do, but with my air cooled GPU until I can make my loop. Lol  Damn the 4k rpm fan on my card being so small, and so loud."
watercooling,3a55rn,SeaJayCJ,3,Wed Jun 17 13:27:02 2015 UTC,"I think it's due to the very large die size, direct-die application, and high-speed fan that they're able to do that. I don't think it's going to outperform a good custom block/rad."
watercooling,3a55rn,bakageta,2,Wed Jun 17 10:16:30 2015 UTC,"I don't see mention of the water delta, so that can be pretty misleading. 500w at 20C over ambient is much more in line with a 120mm rad and high power fan, we'd just normally say it's 250w at 10C.   Woth a 10C delta loop, 40C gpu temps aren't unrrasonable. Adding 10C to the water temp is going to see a similar jump in gpu temps. 50-ish load temps are still loads better than air coolers, and it's why gpu brackets for AIO coolers are becoming more common."

watercooling,3a5xqu,Ile371,2,Wed Jun 17 14:11:22 2015 UTC,"All of the ""brand name"" AIO like lyou have listed + corsair h105/100 etc will give you generally the same performance. I personally wouldnt bother looking at expandability as the pumps supplied tend to be quite weak compared to ones for custom loops. The only reason I would say that expandability is good in your case is to get longer tubing to reach the front of the case."
watercooling,3a5xqu,crashbash2020,1 point,Wed Jun 17 20:08:51 2015 UTC,Thank you for your input. I just got a reply from fractal design saying that kelvin s24 tubes can reach the cpu from the front of my case.  And in that case swiftech and krakens can do it too.   You are probably correct about aio based loops being kind of the cheap man's way to custom looping. I think I'll just get the one with the best price and as silent as possible. I've read corsair coolers aren't known for their silence
watercooling,3a5xqu,sneakyexe,1 point,Wed Jun 17 20:33:19 2015 UTC,They are quiet it's just the faulty ones that aren't. I'm running my 3rd h100i gtx and it's whisper quiet. I keep getting faulty units which is frustrating. I wish I had gone the custom loop route now
watercooling,3a3uec,issact,2,Wed Jun 17 00:41:58 2015 UTC,Make sure everything is sealed and literally flip the computer upside down and then plug the pump in. If that wont dislodge it then I dont know what will.

Usually I just compare the probe to my CPU and as long as it is small difference all is good"
watercooling,3a4qpr,crashbash2020,1 point,Wed Jun 17 08:31:42 2015 UTC,"Same as the other guys, I did not have a temperature sensor for many years, but now I have one. I don't do much with it currently, other than display the temperature on a nice digital readout.  It is nice to see your idle temp at room temp +4°C, and to find that full-blown gaming will not make your temps rise above 50°C except in summer.  But in the long run, I want to incorporate a full-blown fan controller and run the pump and fans depending on temps. Right now it all needs to be adjusted manually. And obviously the parameter to adjust fan speeds and pump power has to be the current temperature."

watercooling,3a3dol,TapeDeck_,2,Wed Jun 17 06:53:50 2015 UTC,"Solid advice here. I wouldn't use just tap water, but it's fine to start with and super easy. I do a flush after with distilled and a bit of vinegar (never precisely measured) and then a final distilled run just for good measure."

watercooling,3a4qv3,Aidenried,3,Wed Jun 17 05:32:06 2015 UTC,"A water cooling system is just a more efficient heat exchanger than a standard air cooling heatsink. It will not cool the PC below ambient and will not reduce the temperature in your room.  If you wanted a very cheap watercooling setup for a CPU you're probably better off with an all-in-one or closed-loop cooler. That said, judging by the wording in your post I think what you're actually after is an air conditioner!"
watercooling,3a4qv3,Nyxi26,2,Wed Jun 17 10:52:23 2015 UTC,+1 he needs an air conditioner and not pc water cooling. Water cooling will make your room even hotter because more heat is exhausted into your room and it wont stay in your case.
watercooling,3a4qv3,Karavusk,3,Wed Jun 17 12:22:30 2015 UTC,"Water cooling just makes the part colder, heat exhausted is the same."
watercooling,3a4qv3,LOLCANADA,1 point,Wed Jun 17 05:59:07 2015 UTC,What is your budget? Do you have any experiences with watercooling?  If not and you are on a tight budget I suggest getting a kit for CPU and an extra GPU block.
watercooling,3a4qv3,Andrej_ID,1 point,Wed Jun 17 06:24:48 2015 UTC,if anything more heat will be exhausted from your computer. water has a higher heat capacity which means it carries more heat away from your components but that heat has to go somewhere. so out through your rads and into your room it goes
watercooling,3a4qv3,metallives,1 point,Wed Jun 17 13:13:18 2015 UTC,"Well here is my 2 cents on this case watercooling is not cheap for a system that works. With that being said there are definatly options if you are on a tight budget. When it comes to store bought systems such as the corsair Hydro are most of the time a waste of time and money due to the lack of heat that can be disipated due to the low residence time of liquid and small rad. However, these can work in situations where your case has less than ideal air flow for a standard cpu fan and heatsink to carry the load. Now that being said it sounds like the ambiant temp in your room is more less what is causing your excessive temps. No watercooling system will drop your temps below ambiant temp just as Nyxi26 stated earlier. so you will have to cool your room down before any system will work. I have a pretty extensive watercooling setup and average load temps are around 38C on CPU and 34C on both GPU but my room temp stays at 69F. As your ambiant temp goes up the amount of heat transfer from your heat sink or rad goes down and cpu or gpu temp goes up."

Maybe I could charge people down the line, but I need to have work to show, and a good amount of it. So it kind of becomes a win win for both parties. They get great photos which can help them enter sponsorships, and I get a portfolio boost.

watercooling,3a45y1,babyattacker,1 point,Wed Jun 17 02:17:50 2015 UTC,"OD = outer diameter. How big it is from outer end to the other end.  ID = inner diameter. How big the hole in the tube is from end to end.  Tubing isn't ""compatible"" with blocks and rads. It has to match the fittings. You need special fittings for hard tubing. I recommend you go for soft tubing and get some compression fittings, but it's your choice.  That tubing is 12mm thick. Find fittings that say they support 12mm thick (convert to fractions of an inch). They're in the sidebar of his site. Once you convert it, it's not hard. Just look at the description to check the fitting's sizes.  I like the Aquacomputer D5 pump. I can't remember if Daz sells them. You can hook it up to your mobo to monitor it and change the speed of it without opening the case. The D5 Vario is almost like the Aquacomputer one, but you have to manually set the speed with a dial on its bottom. You'll have to open the case to adjust, but I don't see why you have to adjust the speed once it's up and running. Just pick and choose any D5 pump. They're all the same in performance, just little features added here and there.  If you want, that EK res is also available in a pump/res combo. The res sits right on top of the pump, and you won't have to decide which pump you want.  You'll need a heat gun to bend the tubing, or you can use 90 degree fittings. This will quickly add up in cost, though."

watercooling,3a45y1,Boy1998,1 point,Wed Jun 17 19:42:39 2015 UTC,"If you want, you could always sell them soon and get a single Fury. It's supposedly better than the Titan X at half the price. Wait till benchmarks are out if you want to go this route.  Unless EK sells blocks soon, you're outta luck, unfortunately. Remember to ALWAYS get the reference (manufacturer's original) design. EVGA has the best warranty that supports watercooling, and many of their cards are reference design.  If you upgrade your GPUs in the future and have watercooling in mind, aim for the reference design. If you're %100 certain you don't want watercooling, get an non-reference, air-cooled card. Blocks sometimes aren't made for all cards. I know they make an ASUS Strix block (this is a non-reference design) but it's a very popular card. Others may not be as successful."

watercooling,39yqhz,eQuiFY,1 point,Tue Jun 16 14:00:00 2015 UTC,"I am also planning my loop and making parts list these days. They say that 250mL concentrate will make 1L of coolant. So I am yet to calculate the total volume of my loop so that I would get a rough idea of how much coolant I will be needing. Because right now I am confused if I need 1 bottle of concentrate or two, because I am planning yellow black theme so I dont want to loose the bright yellow color by extra diluting it.  So think about it or have you done it already if you concerned about not loosing color too much, like me."
watercooling,39yqhz,Jon76,1 point,Tue Jun 16 17:58:20 2015 UTC,"On thanks for the heads up, I never even considered that. How would I calculate the volume of my loop? Just the volume of the tubing + volume of reservoir? Or is there some way to account for the volume of liquid inside each component?"
watercooling,39yqhz,Jon76,1 point,Tue Jun 16 18:56:53 2015 UTC,"Volume of the tube + reservoir is simple, we can calculate that using    (pi)r2 h where h = length of tube/reservoir.    As for the components, we need to consider radiators as well. I guess manufacturers provide internal volume of the radiator, though I am not sure about that.   Anyways if you can roughly estimate the total length of the tubing you are going to use in your loop then you can probably apply a compensation factor after that, for the other equipment. I mean what if your total tubing volume comes out to be only 600mL, then I don't think so other equipment will take that much liquid, but still these are guessed numbers, I am yet to decide my loop so I haven't done my calculations.   But I think to be on safe side, I will order 2 concentrates, because I am planing to drain loop after 3-4 months and I can't get any water cooling parts locally so that would be a spare when I refill my loop then."

There's more video encoding, media centre stuff, encryption, minecraft servers, etc.  Maybe when the little one gets older I'll get back into gaming.

Even if it does, no damage will be done if the parts are off, you'll just have to let them dry. Jump start your psu with only the pump connected to it so you can run the loop with all your parts turned off."
watercooling,39v0cm,ICanHazTehCookie,2,Mon Jun 15 05:55:25 2015 UTC,"Hi! Do it like this:  Install everything in the case, but don't connect any wires. The only thing that can be connected to the PSU is the pump. Then you use our plug (http://shop.ekwb.com/ek-atx-bridging-plug-24-pin) and jump start the PSU. This way you test for leaks and there is no danger for your components. Use paper towels for more protection."
watercooling,39v0cm,Andrej_ID,1 point,Tue Jun 16 12:51:20 2015 UTC,"You could, but the main reason to leak test is to check the fittings and it would be very hard to fill the loop and then put into the case without draining or taking it apart at all.

watercooling,39v0cm,unhappyemo,1 point,Mon Jun 15 01:27:20 2015 UTC,You can leak test outside the case but once you dismember it and install it into your case you have to do a leak test against because you need to recheck all of the fittings again to make sure they won't leak. The fluid won't hurt your system immediately especially if it's non conductive and the system isn't powered on when you test it. If you do have a leak just make sure you have something to catch the water and tighten what's leaking.

watercooling,39vtu2,Kautkto,1 point,Mon Jun 15 05:49:01 2015 UTC,"Yep, don't have any tubes at the top angled down away from the gpu. You can also have a drain valve coming off the pump (use lowest port).   All tubes angle down, following the flow. (so water never has to travel up).

watercooling,39tvlc,NonameA2,3,Sun Jun 14 18:53:21 2015 UTC,"You can get very nice temps at very low fan speeds with all that rad space. You should be able to run everything at load with an aggressive overclock while still maintaining a delta t of less than 10C with fans running less than 900rpm.  You definitely should be aiming for low air resistance radiators. The XE have a medium fpi value but are also thick so they do have medium-high air resistance.  At very low fan speeds, the coolstream XEs aren't the best choice, but the difference between a full set of coolstream XE and more optimized radiators won't be that big.  If the price difference isn't significant I would get the HWL SR2 or XSPC RX V3 instead as those are arguably the best for your proposed set-up."

I would second the previous comment about using the combs but from your response you already have that done.    I've never had any luck with open combs like that myself.

I have been out of the loop (ha, no pun intended) for a bit with W/C, but last I remember the fans make a very negligible difference on temps. Maybe 2-3C maximum when the loop is heat saturated.  I have not used the EK compression fittings. Personally, I have used the Monsoon fittings and Bitspower fittings which both are excellent.   What CPU and GPU do you plan to use?"

The radiators you picked out are 19 FPI which is fairly dense. You'll want to get a high RPM fan and with the heat you are trying to dissipate you will be ok.  I use an aquastream pump and I love it.

watercooling,39qz39,repens,1 point,Sun Jun 14 13:30:39 2015 UTC,"The Corsair fans simply are good, that's why they are used, they also look pretty good due to having the color rings which can be a nice option to have for keeping everything in the same color scheme. I personally have been using SP120s but am not particularly concerned with sound levels and decided to get some higher performance fans that are PWM so at least I can spin them as slow as possible until the power is needed.

Do you think a 92mm and 140mm with noctua fans would work even if my goal was just a quiet and attractive system without much intent to overclock, at least for now?"
watercooling,39qz39,Aparks89,1 point,Mon Jun 15 00:09:07 2015 UTC,"Depends on your ambient temp mostly. If you have decently low ambient temps then your delta doesn't need to be crazy high to compensate.   Also, your loop will eventually reach a temp where it's heat saturated. It won't get any hotter because the dissipation coming from your radiators and the heat coming from the chips will entirely equal out. If you can live with those temps then sure, it won't hurt your equipment to run it semi hot. You just can't OC it from that point."

Mitrebox to hold petg straight while you cut it. Hacksaw. File or sand paper. Or both.   I freehand all my bends but many recommend a mandrel kit.

All in all, it was pretty easy and straightforward.  I cut longer lengths of tube,  and then trimmed them bit by bit to fit in my fittings.  Kautkto had some really good points too.

It does a fair (but not great) job of keeping the 130w TDP under control, but does it very quietly.    However.  I can't recommend the thing.  Fitting it was the most godforsakenly awful thing I've ever had to do, and removing it is genuinely one of the things I'm dreading when I fit my new loop.  Almost enough not to attempt at all.  This is partly due to the board - an Asrock X99M matx, so not exactly the roomiest board to start with, however I'm not sure whether having an ATX one would have helped much.    Basically the fitting is simple.  You screw posts into the mobo backplate, slide the cooler's holes down the posts, and screw some nuts down to secure it.  Easy.  But this doesn't take into account the size of the heatsink above the plates, which not only cover the posts and the nuts to be screwed down, but also the RAM on both sides and the northbridge heatsink.  So you have a tiny amount of access from the direction of the PCI slots to screw everything down.    While Noctua's big coolers are awfully ugly in comparison, I would pick one over BeQuiet every time until BQ do something about their mounting mechanism.    On topic I think a big air cooler might well perform better than your old watercooler, or at least really close.  The Noctua D15 scores very highly against the better current AIO water coolers, and out performs the worse ones."
watercooling,39r0gr,tomllm,2,Sat Jun 13 23:30:40 2015 UTC,"alright, thanks for the post. I have in several places that installing the Dark Rock Pro isnt all that easy. I still chose it over the others such as Phanteks PH-TC14-PE, Thermalright Silver Arrow, Noctua DH-14/5 because it is quiet and the difference in cooling was, at least in the tests that I looked up, fair negligible.  Do you think testing the two on a different CPU (AMD Phenom II X6 1090t) will tell me anything about how well I can expect them to perform on the i7 ?"
watercooling,39r0gr,tomllm,2,Sun Jun 14 09:22:02 2015 UTC,"Well, just have patience when installing it!  You'll be able to fit it, but it might take some time.  If you have the same accessibility problems I did, I got the two nuts on the upper two bolts by using a pair of kebab skewers.  I slid the nut down one skewer onto the top of the bolt and then used the other to prod it into position and turn it a few times.  Then the (terrible) spanner BeQuiet includes could be used to keep turning it.   Anyway, the Phenom has a higher TDP than the i7, so should sort of replicate overclocking the i7.  I say sort of as the two processors probably heat up differently and I've no idea what sort of effect that might have on the cooling.  At stock speeds though, the 88w i7 should run cooler than the 125w Phenom regardless of what you use to cool them.  If you get better results with the 510lc on the Phenom, it'll almost certainly do a better job than the Dark Rock on the 4790."

The EVO X99 only works with processors utilizing the LGA-2011-3 socket.  Because the standard version works on more sockets, it costs more than the EVO X99.  The EVO X99 is essentially a cost-cutting measure."

Hm.  the first block, it's universal.  EK-Supreme LTX - AMD blocks. More copy pasta. ""lower the production costs.""  Who writes this stuff? Still confused. So far I see one is AMD, one is universal, and the other reduced your cost to produce.     Guys I'm begging you, just spend like, 30 minutes writing some good copy so I know the difference between the blocks. I'm begging you.    Ok I can't do anymore.

From my experience (with Alphacool rads and a Bitspower pump top), parts with ports that won't all be used (eg rads and pump tops) come with plugs to fill said unused ports (for example, a rad will come with enough plugs to cover all but two ports). Same with GPU blocks (at least for full blocks, to block off unused ports for SLI). CPU blocks don't, since they only have two ports. It doesn't hurt to order a few anyway though, in case they're missing or aren't the color you want (eg Alphacool shipped me silver plugs for one rad, copper plugs for another).

watercooling,39iv3u,erickliban,2,Fri Jun 12 12:48:24 2015 UTC,i think 60 is pretty good.  i'm more interested in the VRM temps.  the stuttering could be because i don't think there's  a crossfire profile for witcher yet.  i had the same thing happen in GTA and had to disable crossfire.

watercooling,39fvpy,eddyJroth,2,Thu Jun 11 13:43:26 2015 UTC,"If you're going for a single card and want the single fastest 980 TI possible, you should wait for EVGA's Classified Kingpin edition (or consider Zotac's 980 TI Amp Extreme ... if you are daring). It is the only EVGA variant that features three power connectors (8+8+6) and at defaults is expected to be the fastest re-engineered 980 TI possible."
watercooling,39fvpy,Archeagus,2,Thu Jun 11 14:58:48 2015 UTC,I wonder if the Kingpin/Classified/HoF will be similar in terms of clock speeds.
watercooling,39fvpy,Archeagus,2,Thu Jun 11 15:32:06 2015 UTC,"I am very biased towards EVGA, obviously, but if the Zotac is any indications, we're looking at starting clocks in the high 1300 range. Even if they are not the highest this round, I'll go EVGA since I know their hardware and software so well by now. But it seems like its getting harder and harder for any one company to maintain that fastest possible version crown. (ASUS took the last round.)"
watercooling,39fvpy,godzirrasti,2,Thu Jun 11 15:48:01 2015 UTC,"I really like EVGA from the warranty standpoint, but I'm thinking it will be two to three months for the Classified/Kingpin cards. The HoF Galaxy card is rumored to be launching this month and I am really interested to see where it benchmarks because I would love to alter my build for black/white/chrome."
watercooling,39fvpy,Archeagus,1 point,Thu Jun 11 17:00:47 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply! I have been trying to read up more on what my friend told me about the Classified cards and voltage limiters but information seems to be coming up short. I am starting to think I either misunderstood him or that he is mistaken.  One thing I have noted is the 980 Ti SC has an 8 and 6 pin power connector which compared to the other third party cards available with 3 power connectors, may result in OC limitations?  EDIT Adding the Galax HoF that should be out later this month that I was referring to."
watercooling,39fvpy,Archeagus,2,Thu Jun 11 13:55:10 2015 UTC,"The classified card will most likely be binned higher, hand picked, and verified. You may have more voltage options with the classified card too."
watercooling,39fvpy,godzirrasti,1 point,Thu Jun 11 13:55:58 2015 UTC,Do you know if there are any issues with the binning process for Classifieds/Kingpins? This thread on EVGAs site had me wondering if there were issues from the amount of complaints I was seeing. I am unsure if they were user related or if there was a legitimate issue with the cards.
watercooling,39fvpy,Archeagus,2,Thu Jun 11 14:03:26 2015 UTC,My most recent Classifieds were the 780 TIs and mine were purchased about six months apart. I've never had an issue with build quality or PCB stability and thus EVGA Classified's have been my cards of choice for the last three builds.
watercooling,39fvpy,willemdoom,2,Thu Jun 11 15:14:19 2015 UTC,Thanks for the reply! I really like what I have heard about the 780 Ti's. It seems like some people had issues but responses seem overwhelmingly positive now that I have had some more time to research.
watercooling,39fvpy,Archeagus,2,Thu Jun 11 16:58:15 2015 UTC,"I've been very happy with my 780 TIs until very recently. I get the D3D Graphics error in GTA V and a TDR error on occasion when I have Chrome open using recent driver versions. But even though they remain unresolved, these are known issues and they are being worked, so its just one of those things.  The only reason I'm upgrading now (rather than skipping a generation like I normally do between GPU upgrades) is because I'm starting a new custom-built case project from the ground up and it just makes sense to use all new parts for such a project."
watercooling,39fvpy,internet-badboy,2,Thu Jun 11 17:18:12 2015 UTC,"Sorry for the late reply. I have had zero issues with my 780 ti classifieds. I have used both bios provided with the card, and a couple custom bios from overclock.net without issues. The stock voltage limitation was fixed early, and only prevented me from an extreme overclock. I do think the kingpins are a waste of money though. They just seem like a rebranded classy. I have no facts to back the last part up though. Just my opinion."
watercooling,39fvpy,Archeagus,2,Thu Jun 11 22:09:43 2015 UTC,"Before the 980, Kingpins were overpriced and were more branding then actual tangible benefit, yes. But that appears to have changed with the 980 version and I'm hoping the initial hype coming out about the 980 TI version proves legitimate and its performance numbers compelling. I can afford to wait and find out if the Kingpin is going to be fast enough to justify the premium over the Classified."
watercooling,39fvpy,internet-badboy,2,Fri Jun 12 14:56:34 2015 UTC,"Ofcourse number and mhz are all nice, but the real in game difference when running in sli will be marginale. Just buy what you can buy now and you wont have to wait another month to play amazing games such as witcher 3 and gta 5."
watercooling,39fvpy,Oversidee,1 point,Thu Jun 11 14:23:15 2015 UTC,"This depends on the person. If you're new or apathetic or this is your first build in a while and you are trying to balance budget with performance and other factors, then yes, the 980 TI SC makes perfect sense. But if your an enthusiast or a hobbyist or you're looking to put (another) stamp on the mod build boards, then you want the best of the best to be part of your signature (or, alternatively and just as fun, you want to take a runner up and tune it into the best of the best!)."

watercooling,39h2pd,eddyJroth,2,Thu Jun 11 17:49:49 2015 UTC,"It's not an easy choice at times, so here are some points worth considering:   The hydro copper blocks are now made by EKWB but they're not compatible with their bridges and terminals.  This is important in case one day you decide to get another card, it means you'll want to grab another hydrocopper so that everything lines up.  This can be hard though as they do sell out fast.  Not an issue though if you only stick with one card like you mention. Binning is worth thinking about.  As one of their top premium products, EVGA will most likely be picking better samples for use in their hydrocopper cards.  This is not a guarantee though, a normal card can do very well too. Selling a WC card later on is very difficult.  If you ever plan on selling you old card before upgrading, you'd be much better off with an air version.  If you add the waterblock yourself, you can just add the old air cooler back in order to sell it.  Most WC enthusiasts tend to buy the newest cards rather than a previous gen second hand one, as such the market is much, much smaller."
watercooling,39h2pd,Makirole,1 point,Thu Jun 11 18:54:48 2015 UTC,"I would be careful buying the board separate, companies like EVGA bin cards so I would imagine that their normal version of a card would have much less potential than a HC."

watercooling,39b6y6,Sgt_Bilbo,4,Thu Jun 11 19:44:09 2015 UTC,"Shoving the memory on the same die as the GPU will make generic GPU coolers more relevant (only leaves VRMs to cool), but concentrating heat will likely reduce cooling efficiency (more heat to be dissipated by a smaller area), especially since the Fury's supposed to draw 300W."
watercooling,39b6y6,conet,2,Wed Jun 10 16:49:22 2015 UTC,"I think it will have basically zero practical impact on full-cover block design. There are already ITX cards with appropriate blocks, and blocks already cool the memory. I don't think the closer proximity of the HBM dies to the core will negatively impact core or memory cooling enough to require a major rethink of flow patterns or channel design.   One thing about HBM that may wind up being a double edged sword for some users is that existing ""universal"" blocks may not work on them, but any universal style block that cools the core+HBM chips without cooling the VRM's should be compatible with all Fury cards. In that case a user with a non-reference PCB with no available full cover block will be able to cool core + memory instead of just the core, as is the case today."
watercooling,39b6y6,Owan,1 point,Wed Jun 10 20:09:31 2015 UTC,"Well the main heat source is ofc the gpu. While memory is important, I think it isn't as temperature critical as cooling the gpu.

watercooling,39c7vw,ICanHazTehCookie,1 point,Wed Jun 10 20:49:49 2015 UTC,What happens is that the warm water goes through the radiator and the fans blowing the air past the fins cool the water and blow the heat that was trapped in the water into the room.
watercooling,39c7vw,Nyxi26,1 point,Wed Jun 10 21:00:41 2015 UTC,"You'd be delaying your room heating maybe 20 minutes. I'll try the math with my system.  My ambient temperature (and starting coolant temperature) is 23 C. My gaming coolant temperature is 40C. I have 500mL of coolant in my system.  For the sake of simplicity I'll assume it's 100% water, (even though it's not).  The energy stored in that coolant compared to ambient is 17*4.184*500= 36400 J   My computer has a i7-4790k and a 290X, so that's about 300W while gaming (at my clocks)  It would take 36400/300=121 seconds worth of energy to heat the coolant to that temperature, so you're only really storing 2 minutes worth of heat."

watercooling,39b936,dasfohlen,2,Wed Jun 10 16:13:36 2015 UTC,Yes but your temps wont be any lower than air. You'll probably want another 120 in the loop somewhere to balance it out.
watercooling,39b936,niceandcreamy,2,Wed Jun 10 16:47:02 2015 UTC,"Not the same card, but isn't there a large difference between an air cooled 980 ti and the EVGA 980 ti hybrid? It only uses a single 120 rad."
watercooling,39b936,ALL_grey,2,Wed Jun 10 18:06:02 2015 UTC,I would recommend adding at least a 120mm.  I currently use a 280 rad with the i5-4670k and a 280x and the gaming temps are well in the 60c. If I had the money and space I would mos def add a 240 or 280 in the loop.

This allows me to have then run very very slowly on idle while still keeping temps under 23c and then spin up when the CPU is loaded.  additionally anything that ISNT PWM will run 100% when used on that splitter.  Fan Controls give you more control, independent channels, and the high end ones can automate stuff with their own independent temp probes for temp readings. But for a basic install its hard to beat 15$"

Without using PWM, you'll need a fan controller to adjust voltage to control fan speed.  This is typically a manual adjustment made with knobs or dials on the face of the controller (unless you use an Aquaero or something similar).  With PWM fans and an appropriate splitter, you can use the cpu fan motherboard header and bios/3rd party software to control fan speed according to preset temps."

watercooling,399mf7,crashbash2020,1 point,Wed Jun 10 06:59:40 2015 UTC,"Absolutely the best answer. Fan power and radiator capability mean more than a general rule of thumb. A thin radiator and weak fans will perform MUCH worse than a thick radiator and high power fans - it's up to you what you run.  I cool a Xeon x5650 @ 4.4ghz and 2x GTX 680's on a single 360 - a black ice gtx with 3x San Ace H101's. It's loud, but performance is better than most 480mm loops I've seen with quiet fans.  With slower fans, your CPU will probably see the higher temps. Your overclock may be limited because of it. The GPU won't be as cool as other custom loops, but it'll still be better than stock. If you want a quiet system and high clocks, I'd go for more rad space."
watercooling,399mf7,bakageta,3,Wed Jun 10 11:06:40 2015 UTC,"2x240mm rads will provide more cooling, and the ability to cool cpu and gpu on an individual rad, rather than shared. However, a 360mm should be adequate enough as a rule of thumb is 120mm rad per cpu/gpu item. However, this depends on cooling cap of rad."
watercooling,399mf7,Herrowgayboi,2,Wed Jun 10 07:40:55 2015 UTC,"There's no real point in doing separate loops, from a performance perspective. With split loops, if either loop isn't at full load, that's wasted cooling that could be used on the active component. Gaming rarely maxes both, so a single loop makes better use of available cooling. If you mean a single loop with a rad between components, that's only really useful for aesthetics, at the flow rate our loops run. With the exception of extreme systems (quad-sli), the water temp at any two points in your loop shouldn't vary by more than around 1C.  At 1gpm, it takes over 250w (I want to say 263w) of heat to raise the temp 1C. Quad SLI could raise temps 4+ C, but a single card or CPU is barely a blip. There's no reason to put a rad between components other than looks. A single 480 should perform just a hair better than two 240s from the same series, thanks to resistance."
watercooling,399mf7,bakageta,2,Wed Jun 10 11:17:28 2015 UTC,"Agreed with you sir. We're not talking a huge difference in temperatures, but you will see differences. But as I mentioned, this ultimately comes down to the cooling cap of the rad, and how good it is at dispersing heat. that said though, at idle, the temperature isn't noticable at all, but when at full load you'll see a small difference, but $50 difference? Not really. I do agree it's mainly for aesthetics."

Yep, that's why I mentioned  rads of the same series, though I suppose some manfs could have different performance across sizes even in the same series.   that said though, at idle, the temperature isn't noticable at all, but when at full load you'll see a small difference, but $50 difference? Not really. I do agree it's mainly for aesthetics.    I agree completely, idle temps should be incredibly low on virtually any custom loop, even one that is too weak at load. Multiple rads in a single loop (vs a single large of the same type/total size) comes down to aesthetics, and what fits your build best. Few cases offer 480 mounting, but dual 240 is getting quite a bit more common.  I probably wouldn't place one rad between the cpu and gpu just for cleaner tubing routing, but if you're doing it for looks, any performance difference would be within the margin of error, and who am I to tell you what layout you like.  Dual 240 mounting seems to be front and top most often, and for looks I'd do 240 front with ports at bottom, to bottom of gpu, to cpu, to top 240 with ports at front, straight-ish down to res / pump at the bottom, back to front res, depending on the case of course."
watercooling,399mf7,bakageta,1 point,Wed Jun 10 22:00:05 2015 UTC,Exactly what I would say. One 120(or 140mm) radiator per part.  Double rad looks way cooler as well. But it adds so much costs to an already expensive setup anyway.
watercooling,399mf7,kerel,1 point,Wed Jun 10 09:43:50 2015 UTC,"You should be okay. Generally you can cool 150W on each radiator, and the TDP of each is well below 200W."

watercooling,399mf7,Ludacon,2,Wed Jun 10 11:34:23 2015 UTC,"It could likely handle 1000w, but the components wouldnt be  nice and low.   For instance i run a predessor to that radiator. The Black Ice Extreme 360mm with F-12s pushing and 200mm case fans pulling, and it keps a 2500k @ 5.0ghz with 1.48vcore under 55C 100% load with a 48hour heat soak (ok 58C if we count the bastard core 4 that always runs hot)  Add in some GPUS and you are looking at another 5c rise on the CPU temp because your increasing the heat the radiator has to get rid off, thus reducing the post radiator water temperature, which reduces the amount of heat it can remove from the cpu waterblock in the time that it travels through it.   THAT BEING SAID. Im guessing you arent trying to push your gear to the ragged edge, and just want something nice and simple to help keep everything colder that stock and get some more stable moderate overclocks. Either setup would be sufficient, with the 240mm having slightly more capacity, but also complexity for the install. The case you are installing into will probably have a bigger impact on final choice."
watercooling,399mf7,Ludacon,1 point,Wed Jun 10 13:46:57 2015 UTC,"Well, currently, I only have around 400watts of power being used by the CPU+GPU, so I'd imagine that would cool it pretty well. When I end up getting a 2nd 970, I will definitely pick up another one of those rads.  Oddly enough, my 4th core is always 5 degrees cooler than the rest of my cores. Lol"
watercooling,399mf7,ICanHazTehCookie,1 point,Wed Jun 10 14:26:17 2015 UTC,"i have no doubt that it could cool dual 970s and the CPU, but you just have to accept the slightly higher temps and slightly lower overclocks.   If i ever put my 970s on water ill be doing a 240mm in addition to the 360mm to help keep the temps low.

watercooling,397hfe,Smushin,2,Tue Jun 9 20:27:06 2015 UTC,Have you compared it to d5 pumps in spec?  Edit looked up a d5 and it seems to be about the same just 12 watts less than the d5. Max pressure on the d5 says 50 but your pump mentions 4. And the l/min are the same. Price difference is something. All you'd need for yours would be a bushing reducer and a fitting. Shouldn't be hard to try out.
watercooling,397hfe,Phyco_Boy,1 point,Tue Jun 9 22:25:02 2015 UTC,Does the Psi make a difference in water cooling systems? I know if a cooling system is pressurized it lowers the boiling point. The price doesn't mean anything as I can get them cheaper then any PC water pump. As for bushing reducer and fitting are you referring to bringing the 3/4in O/D Fittings to say 1/4 or 1/2.. so forth?

watercooling,397hfe,Trueno07,1 point,Tue Jun 9 23:40:14 2015 UTC,"Pressure makes a difference because there is a pressure loss for each length of pipe each fitting each block and so on and so forth. Is it huge? No, not really. Of they're close enough that's fine.   As far as bushing yes you will probably have to adapt whatever the pump is t the G1/4 size.

watercooling,397hfe,Kingdud,1 point,Wed Jun 10 02:54:32 2015 UTC,"What is the head pressure on that unit? I can't find it. That and the discharge pressure (discharge pressure != head pressure) are the biggest differences I could see/imagine. The difference is that discharge pressure determines when pipes burst and seals break, head pressure determines how far a jet of water shoots vertically out the top of the pump.  The former is useful for not breaking your radiator/pipes/blocks. The latter is useful for ensuring that water keeps flowing even though you have fairly restrictive blocks/radiators.  The only other thing I can think of is triple check there are no aluminum surfaces in the water path, and if there are, get aluminum rads/blocks. Automotive applications always have galvanic corrosion inhibitors, most PC water cooling loops do not."
watercooling,397hfe,crashbash2020,1 point,Wed Jun 10 03:10:29 2015 UTC,"Pressure really only affects the point at which it boils, if your water is anywhere near 100C you have bigger problems so it wont make much of a difference. I think in comparison 4PSI isn't that much compared to standard watercooling pumps anyway, most parts are rated for 1 bar max of pressure (~13PSI). Chances are it will just be a louder version.  FYI usually the pressure stated is the ""stall pressure"" ie the pressure generated at 100% resistance, and the flow rate is the negligible resistance case, so max flow possible. Because of the blocks high restriction, chances are you wont see the benefits of a high flow pump in a WC PC as it will be strictly limited by the available pressure"
watercooling,397hfe,RumpleForeSkin72,2,Wed Jun 10 04:21:47 2015 UTC,"In the earlier days of watercooling (Celly 300a's anyone?) , automotive parts were pretty common actually, there just wasn't many other sources for smaller radiators so an alternative was to use a heater core or intercooler with 12v pumps like you listed here."
watercooling,397hfe,herminzerah,2,Wed Jun 10 00:36:29 2015 UTC,Assuming internal to the pump the fluid does not come in to contact with any metals that would cause corrosion of waterblocks it's a slightly lower flowing and slightly less head pressure pump than the D5. Sorry overall probably very comparable however there's 2 possible issues I see.  1) Corrosion due to mixing metals (I don't know shit about construction of automotive water pumps though).  2) It could possibly be loud as I doubt they cared a ton about the sound of a pump that is probably generally no where near a person when it's operating.
watercooling,397hfe,Whitelabl,1 point,Wed Jun 10 02:25:16 2015 UTC,"Damn,  1200 L/hr.   You can probably use it as an external pump, outside of your loop - granted you can control the voltage to vary the speed.  But as a direct connection - that'll blow the seals off and just leak out."
watercooling,397hfe,niceandcreamy,1 point,Tue Jun 9 22:26:38 2015 UTC,The 1200L/hr is only 20L/min which is pretty normal as far as I can see. To add to that the operating pressure is lower then PC pumps.

watercooling,397hfe,ICanHazTehCookie,1 point,Wed Jun 10 02:27:53 2015 UTC,"Head pressure can be calculated from the discharge pressure using the specific gravity of the coolant. Here are some calcs and a chart: http://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/pump-head-pressure-d_663.html  It's about 9ft of head for water, which is half the output of a Laing pump. Looking at the max flow and max head numbers, the pump you linked is similar to the Koolance PMP-300.  Assuming my flow monitor is properly calibrated, I'm getting 4.5 L/min with a Laing pump through a res, 120 rad, 240 rad, cpu, and 2 gpu blocks with no drop offs (end of loop feeds to below coolant surface). Looking at the pump performance curve for Laing (PMP-400), you can see that 4.5 L/min translates to about 3.3 m (10.8 ft) of headloss through my system.  As such, your pump would be completely unsuitable for my build or similar. I can only recommend the pump you linked for a CPU or GPU only loop."

At the same settings, there's no difference."
watercooling,3999u9,SeaJayCJ,3,Wed Jun 10 08:40:03 2015 UTC,"The heat exhausted by an air cooler is the same as the heat exhausted from a radiator. The same wattage has to be dissipated, whether it be through a heatsink and fan or radiator."

watercooling,3999u9,crashbash2020,2,Wed Jun 10 06:56:30 2015 UTC,"According to the laws of physics, heat that goes into your cooler (out of your CPU) must go out of the cooler (into your room) UNLESS it is being stored. If this happened long-term, your temperatures would rise indefinitely and cause damage or prevent operation at full power.  Power actually IS stored in an air cooler though-- in the short term. Some heat builds up in the heat sink and in the processor itself until they are hot enough to overcome the cooler's low thermal conductivity. Once it is hot enough, the heat out will equal the heat in, and the temperature will be steady (at some relatively high level).   This gives the interesting result that the heat released into your room will be delayed for longer when you begin using the computer, but will be released later, after you shut down the computer. So it's true the behavior of how it heats your room is different, but not anything you'd notice in real life-- and nothing that makes a difference in the ""big picture"""

You're right, in that if it was to be filled from the pump, air would travel upwards.   This is why certain reservoirs have pieces of plastic in them, for example the EK res; when having both the input and output at the bottom of the res/pump, a whirlpool effect can be created, which can result in air being drawn into the system; the plastic prevents this from happening."

watercooling,395s5d,ThePoliteButton,1 point,Tue Jun 9 17:43:50 2015 UTC,"Ooh, interesting. I suppose in that setup, any air would be trapped the the tubing, and wouldn't flow backwards towards the CPU block, so that wouldn't be a problem. The question is what would happen if the tubing wasn't bent like that...  I suppose if there isn't too much resistance in the loop it should be fine. With enough pressure, no air should go up to equalise. Imagine poking a hole in the bottom of a bottle of water, it kind of glugs as air is forced upwards to equalise the drop in pressure to do escaping water. Compare that to a hole in the bottom of a bucket; it won't ""glug"" as the atmosphere is maintaining a balance of pressure. In the loop, the pump is doing what the atmosphere does, and maintaining pressure.   Still, I'd be surprised if there wasn't any air in that tube, and personally I wouldn't use that setup, considering when the system is turned off, air will definitely go up into the tube. It would be interesting so see what that setup looks like with clear tubing, unfortunately can't find anything atm as I'm on mobile."

So right now I have the tube clamped to reduce flow rate through the external rad and balance resistance with the internal loop.  Is this a good solution? should I get a valve to regulate the flow even more precisely or should I completely redisgn the loop to balance out resistance?  Keeping a parallel design would be nice so I can just quick-disconnect the external rad without completely breaking flow."
watercooling,395s5d,niceandcreamy,1 point,Tue Jun 9 16:55:18 2015 UTC,Pictures would be nice but I'll tell you the easiest way to add an external-removable radiator. Add a ball valve between two 'T' fittings and put the loop into one end of the contraption and out the other. Then connect your quick disconnects to the open ports on the 'T' fittings and bam. If you want to use the external radiator plug in the rad to the quick disconnects and close the valve shut. Make sure you do it in that exact order so you dont block the flow for your pump.

watercooling,395s5d,ForsakenBob,1 point,Tue Jun 9 17:39:28 2015 UTC,"There are a lot of ways to control fans - ultimately it depends on what your goal is. In a really fancy setup, you can utilize a fan controller, where the fan speed can be manually adjusted, or automatically controlled via temperature probes inside the case.  In less fancy setups, you can wire your fans directly to your power supply. Most 12V fans run much quieter when powered using your 5V pins, and some manufacturers (like Noctua) even supply you with special limiters you can install if things aren't quiet enough. That being said, these limiters hinder cooling performance, and removing them requires opening your case to disconnect them.  Personally, I just opt for quiet fans with high static pressure (good for radiators), then wire them up directly to the PSU. This way I get consistent performance out of a very simple setup, and the fans are plenty quiet as far as I'm concerned."
watercooling,395s5d,niceandcreamy,1 point,Tue Jun 9 19:41:10 2015 UTC,You'll need all PWM fans or a fan controller to control fans based on temps. If you have all PWM fans just use a powered PWM splitter and plug all the fans into that. Then run the PWM wire into your motherboard header.   Something like this http://www.performance-pcs.com/new-evercool-5x-4pin-pwm-splitter-cable.html  If you don't want to go that route get yourself a fan controller.
watercooling,395s5d,alphanimal,1 point,Tue Jun 9 19:42:13 2015 UTC,If you take the easy route and use the mainboard fan controls it will likely be the CPU temp controlling the main fans. I'm not aware of a mainboard that can control fan speed based on external sensors like water temperature.  A good dedicated fan controller can give you a lot of freedom to set it up the way you want.

watercooling,393f7v,Archeagus,3,Wed Jun 10 08:49:50 2015 UTC,"I am considering the same myself. The benefit that I can no longer live without is how quiet full water cooling can be. Open headphone gaming is so much better without the loud humming of small GPU fans.  Also, all about the aesthetics."
watercooling,393f7v,AWoodenFishOnWheels,2,Tue Jun 9 02:44:32 2015 UTC,"Be careful what parts you get. I made a poor choice on the fan controller for my 360mm cooler for my CPU, and the fans spin at the same speed constantly. So even browsing reddit it sounds like its under full load. And it's not super loud, in fact its pretty quiet in comparison to air cooled PC's I've had in the past, but not nearly as quiet as I'd hoped it would be."
watercooling,393f7v,BanginBanana,3,Tue Jun 9 06:27:09 2015 UTC,"Hybrid is a compromise. You are not quite getting the GPU performance nor the lower decibel levels of liquid cooling and you are locked in to that configuration for the card's lifetime. Its only a good choice if you don't have the resources to fully embrace custom liquid cooling.  But therein lies the rub: A proper custom liquid cooling setup generally requires a bottoms-up fresh build the first time unless you happen to have a LC-friendly case to start with. And your PC parts need to be fresh enough that waterblocks are still readily available. (Generic blocks are available for most parts, but you generally want to avoid generic parts whenever possible.)  I would recommend you do some research on a potential build. Depending on what you want to cool (just CPU + GPU? CPU/Chipset/Mosfets + GPU?) how much rad space you have (single large rad for all, or multiple rads for dedicated loops?) and the kind of lines you want to run, the hybrid alternative might make more sense if you perceive any hurdles that are more hassle than they are worth."

watercooling,393f7v,Swiggety666,1 point,Tue Jun 9 20:39:17 2015 UTC,It's not that hard to be honest. I did a full loop first time bar ram dimms with rigid tubing and it went ok. You just need to be diligent with o ring fitting and ensuring your tube cuts are clean and compression fittings are tight.   Compared to the horror stories I've heard from five years ago water cooling is now a cake walk.
watercooling,393f7v,krage,5,Wed Jun 10 09:50:24 2015 UTC,"It is for aesthetics.  Sweet, sweet aesthetics."
watercooling,393f7v,lucifeil,3,Tue Jun 9 00:41:59 2015 UTC,This post is correct. Custom loops might give slightly better cooling. But that does not transform into much practical performance gains. It's basically all about the looks of a custom loop. You do it because you can/love the way it looks.   But theres also noise too I suppose. With a custom loop (depending on what loop you do) it can be made to run very quiet indeed
watercooling,393f7v,jcgill,0,Tue Jun 9 09:08:10 2015 UTC,But if silence is the only reason air cooling can be as silent for much cheaper
watercooling,393f7v,lucifeil,6,Tue Jun 9 14:42:22 2015 UTC,Silently cooling a 250W+ GPU on air will be a serious challenge no matter the budget
watercooling,393f7v,jcgill,2,Tue Jun 9 16:16:39 2015 UTC,"Piggy backing off the reply below me, water cooling's biggest pro when it comes to silence is how low you can run the fans. With enough rad space, quality rads and quality fans, you could run the fans at RPMs of 800. At load. I do not know any air coolers which could dissipate the combined heat output of a CPU and GPU running at those fan speeds.  Of course not all water loops can achieve that kind of performance, and price always comes into these questions."

When I started to work at EK I have got EK X240 kit for my case and this was also my first experience. The best thing about the kit is, everything you need is in the box. If you buy things separately, you might run into problems, maybe you forget to buy something, or some things don't fit etc.  750D is a great case for running a custom loop. If you don't have a limited budget I suggest EK X360 kit, as you get all of our flagship products, although L series is also a great product - it was updated recently to revision 2.0.  Later, when you will expand your loop with a GPU block, you will just add two fittings and some extra tube if necessary.  If you have any questions about our products, just ask or write me PM. :)"

watercooling,3936vu,nono0044,1 point,Mon Jun 8 23:21:42 2015 UTC,"the only issue i see with the corsair 750d is that it depends on the width of the rad.  ex. 60mm rad can only so a push or pull       30mm rad can do a push and pull  both being at the top.   do you/anybody know if its better to pick your own parts for a beginner, or is this a great starting point with the ability to expand in the future?"
watercooling,3936vu,nono0044,2,Mon Jun 8 23:41:14 2015 UTC,"Hmm well it's not really specified what thickness the rad is.  Maybe send an email to either EK or PPC to ask about it.

If not, this kit is a good place to start if you don't want the headache of putting a parts list together.  One though though, I'd recommend getting some angle adapters (45/90 degrees).

watercooling,390z15,YouGotAte,3,Mon Jun 8 22:12:57 2015 UTC,"I believe mixing copper and nickel is fine, also acetal is a plastic-esque material. Problems arise if aluminum is introduced. Also the Mayhem's fluid claims to have anti-corrosion properties so I think I should be safe."
watercooling,390z15,JSekai,2,Tue Jun 9 01:41:56 2015 UTC,"Someone correct me if i'm mistaken, but afaik mixing metals is bad only if you're introducing aluminum into a loop that has copper."

watercooling,3936dq,Ace_Entity,1 point,Mon Jun 8 22:42:05 2015 UTC,"You also need to remember that the reason the hybrid had higher fps in his tests was because he kept the reference 980 ti at 1400 mhz (not his max oc) and he had the hybrid one running at its max oc. Imo he should've run all cards at their respective max oc's, although I understand how that isn't a fair comparison since not everyone will get the same max oc. EDIT: If you slap a block on your 980 ti, you will definitely get the same or better performance depending on your setup (number of rads, pump, etc)"

watercooling,3936dq,conet,1 point,Tue Jun 9 00:16:45 2015 UTC,"Maybe not, I've heard the GPU itself is AIO cooled and the VRMs/VRAM are air cooled. You'd get better cooling with a full card block but in reality for overclocking a full block doesn't help a ton (maybe a few percent). That said, unless you want a the tubing/rad/fan/crappy AIO pump to contend with, and if you want to do a proper loop, a full card block/backplate is the way to go. It's far sexier at the very least, for about $50/card (based on the hybrid case and EK's block+backplate price)."
watercooling,3936dq,nono0044,1 point,Tue Jun 9 03:58:57 2015 UTC,Performance should be bit better since the waterblock is probably designed better.  The hybrid one probably has a simply block design due to the fact that it still has to play well with the aircooling bits.    Another thing is that theres no fans and no heat being blown around with a waterblock as opposed to a hybrid card with fans.
watercooling,391j60,StringingSalmon,4,Mon Jun 8 15:59:30 2015 UTC,980ti costs about the same as both of those cards (especially the kingpin) and stomps both in performance

The 2x8 pin connections on the Classified won't hold you back at all, don't worry. One 8 pin gives a max of 150W of power, with the 60W from the PCIe slot you can give you card 360W max. It's enough."

I have 2* 240mm Rads and a 140mm res in there. Be wary as in the front of the case my 240 doesn't fit fully (Not tightened by all screws but it won't go anywhere). You can get cleaner runs than I have (will sort it out when it comes to clean it) but with the current setup I get max temps of about  40C. It runs at about 35/37 most of the time but I am running boinc.
watercooling,391rjh,garveyjd3,1 point,Mon Jun 8 18:58:39 2015 UTC,"looks good, but i don't have enough money to watercool my GPU and my CPU and i think i'm going to put an 240 rad on te top. and watercool my CPU first and after some time my GPU."
watercooling,391rjh,garveyjd3,1 point,Tue Jun 9 14:15:50 2015 UTC,That is fair enough. There is more than enough space up top for a 240 and I did have a 120 AIO in the back and that gave me reasonable temps too. Personally I can't find many builds out there using it but the CM693 is fine for a loop.   Can I recommend a kit with a D5 pump. The DDC is smaller but a variable D5 is great- at setting 2 it is basically silent and it really is quiet. I just know some have said their DDC can be loud.  When choosing a kit there is often very little difference between them - review sites will often show a degree here or there. The main factor that will sway something will often be the looks.

watercooling,391lqr,TinyRumchata,1 point,Mon Jun 8 16:16:43 2015 UTC,The more radiators you have the better.  Generally you'll need 1x120mm radiator per component plus 1 or 2 120mm if you're overclocking.   Reservoir size really doesn't matter except for aesthetics.
watercooling,391lqr,TinyRumchata,1 point,Mon Jun 8 16:22:24 2015 UTC,So my hypothetical about 1 140mm and a 240mm radiator would be okay? I was thinking about putting the 240 in the front of my computer and the 140 on the top so the 140mm would cool the GPU after the CPU has been cooled. Then the liquid would come to the 240mm before being pumped around again. Does that sounds like a good build?
watercooling,391lqr,TinyRumchata,1 point,Mon Jun 8 16:39:07 2015 UTC,"If you can fit larger radiators, that would be the way to go.  But that sounds pretty good.   Actually cooling doesn't work quite like that. You could put the radiators next to each other in loop order and it doesn't matter where they're placed in the loop. They will still cool the components at almost the same rate. The water will be heated roughly to the same temperature throughout the loop. The temperature delta before and after the radiator isn't as extreme as you would think."
watercooling,391lqr,TinyRumchata,1 point,Mon Jun 8 16:53:32 2015 UTC,"Hmmmm, alright. That'll give me a bit more to think about on that subject. So, should I just scrap the 140 mm the top and just use a 280mm on the top?"
watercooling,391lqr,TinyRumchata,2,Mon Jun 8 16:56:44 2015 UTC,Whatever gives you a higher amount of surface area for cooling will generally be better.
watercooling,391lqr,unhappyemo,1 point,Mon Jun 8 17:03:07 2015 UTC,A quick question. Currently I have an Antec three hundred case with little to no room. How would I go about doing a system that is mostly outside of the case? Could I just drill holes into the chassis and attach the parts to the case. Would it just be better to buy a new case. I was thinking about just getting the define S.
watercooling,391lqr,unhappyemo,1 point,Mon Jun 8 18:12:53 2015 UTC,"You can cut holes in your case if you have the appropriate tools.  Personally, I would get a case that would support your needs.

The polycarb res is really weak and the fittings sit between the seams of the plastic. I had two eisbergs crack in the exact same place.

I used a heatgun, lightly heated it up around the area then bent and held to shape. Only do one bend at a time.   It doesn't need much heat to bend.   Another note, are yo getting all the plastic shavings out of the tube from the hacksaw before bending? That could give a bubble effect."
watercooling,38ywnh,Kautkto,1 point,Mon Jun 8 00:59:05 2015 UTC,"I'm sure it's PETG.  It wouldn't shatter, and has the telltale lines that PETG tubing has.  It's also written on the packaging from Primochill.  I tried heating it up at a lower temp / further away from the source, but it just wouldn't become maleable.  I think part of it has to do with the silicon insert being so rigid and not very flexible, but if I don't use the insert, the tubing just collapses.   And yes, I've made sure the shavings were out of the tube.  The one thing I'm thinking it could be is that I used the lubricant solution that came with the insert.  I think it's water based, so I'm wondering if it's steaming and creating the bubbles.  Do you think that's possible?  And do you have any ideas on what I could do to avoid that?  The insert is really difficult to get in without the lubricant.  Maybe if I use olive oil instead?"
watercooling,38ywnh,Kautkto,2,Mon Jun 8 01:22:03 2015 UTC,"I used olive oil. Your best bet would be to heat, bend and hold. It shouldn't bend of its own accord. Make sure you heat up the general area not just where you're bending."

Besides the wow factor, why go for such a big case when you don't have the need for it?  Go for the 900D over the Cosmos II.  While big and shiny, the Cosmos II was never really designed to be able to accommodate watercooling.  But like I said, if you want to get your hands dirty, you can always mod the case to make things fit.  The sub isn't really a place to ask for parts lists.  Watercooling is so specific to each build and to each persons taste its better if you had some idea of what you are doing.  No point in us telling you what to get when you a) might not like the look of the parts, and b) Don't understand how these parts work or why they are chosen.  Do some of your own research to have a solid understanding of watercooling, watercooling parts, and how everything works.  The side bar on the sub is a good place to start.

watercooling,38tyfs,Player-X,1 point,Sat Jun 6 21:28:56 2015 UTC,"the armor kit on the mobo has a little tiny fan to help with airflow in that area... and i have the 140mm AF 140 fan as well exhausting.  but temp wise prior to this with the noctuas i'd hit 52c streaming league and teh gpu would get around 55c, with the old corsair fans before i'd hit 48-49c on the cpu and 53 on the gpu.  so i'm gonna see how this goes, i assume they might be a little warmer but, i like the layout more, and wanted to mock it up for my next case.. looking into a Define S or Evolv ATX when it's released."

watercooling,38v4i0,portos101,2,Sun Jun 7 02:19:45 2015 UTC,my d5 vario at max level 5 is pretty quiet. are you still getting the little air sound or is it strictly motor at this point. In order for me to even hear the pump i need to turn everything off and put my ear next to it.
watercooling,38v4i0,anotheraznguy,2,Sun Jun 7 04:48:14 2015 UTC,"kinda pissed, I didn't know that alphacool had a white edition of that radiator.   Good job though!  I had issues with clearance on the top because of the thickness of my fans, so I can't use the cpu fan header and had to use system/4 pin connectors."
watercooling,38v4i0,Blowmewhileiplaycod,1 point,Sun Jun 7 06:09:06 2015 UTC,It was cheaper than the black version and there wasnt many option for 420mm 60mm thick radiator. After ordering I stressed that I ordered something too big but I have 2mm clearance between the motherboard and the radiator. The 8 CPU power was in place before the radiator because I dont think I could put it in place.
watercooling,38v4i0,Blowmewhileiplaycod,2,Sun Jun 7 13:23:01 2015 UTC,You fit a 60? I got the 45 and have issues. I had to dremel my CPU power to fit once the radiator was in place but it wasn't a big deal.  This may all be because my fans are rather thick though
watercooling,38v4i0,anotheraznguy,2,Sun Jun 7 13:40:42 2015 UTC,I have my fan in the top part in pull configuration. With a 45 I would have a lot more room. I also didn't have problem with the CPU power since the cable that came with the power supply are thin/flat cable instead of round/big cable
watercooling,38v4i0,anotheraznguy,1 point,Sun Jun 7 15:33:06 2015 UTC,"I don't have any more bubbles in the system I think. The sound I hear is a costant ""hum"" that I find loud.  I was mostly looking for silent build while not giving up too much on performance with this build."

watercooling,38v4i0,Cartman372,1 point,Sun Jun 7 16:44:35 2015 UTC,I would say it's on 12v. It's connected with a molex with 2 pin. And the pump is mounted on the included  pump mount from the case.
watercooling,38v4i0,Cartman372,1 point,Sun Jun 7 18:57:04 2015 UTC,Hard to tell but does the mount have any rubber or foam to isolate noise?   Something that would isolate the noise of the pump from the case.  like this   http://www.amazon.com/Phobya-Noise-Destructor-Universal-Pump/dp/B004CLCI0S  or   http://www.ekwb.com/shop/pumps-and-accessories/pumps-accessories/ek-ddc-anti-vibration-mounting.html  That should help isolate the noise a bit in case. a cheap low cost test would be to make a homemade sponge and just test it that way before buying anything.

watercooling,38vixi,keista,5,Sun Jun 7 04:39:39 2015 UTC,"You might want to start by heading over to the sidebar there should be a guide to get you all started.   Well it depends on the parts you want to cool.   CPU waterblock - Google EK waterblocks and check out their site you should find a block for the socket you're using.  GPU waterblock - same as above but for your GPU.   Radiator - you want to have enough radiator space to cool your components. Rule of thumb I'm pretty sure is 120mm of rad space per component + 120mm extra to be safe. Rad size doesn't matter much you want to get something with high fin density if possible if not don't sweat it. They also come in various sizes like 120mm, 240mm, 360mm, 480mm. They have more than that but that's a start. They also come in different thickness just get what fits in the case.   Fans - Honestly pick a fan you like and throw it on the radiator. Some people will use noctuas or sp120s/af120s and so on because they are good for moving air.   Water pump - you can use DDC pumps or go with a D5 pump.   Fittings - You can use barb fittings which you push the soft tubing over and put a clamp on for safety so it doesn't slip off. You can also use compression fittings which is like a barb fitting but it has a locking color that goes over the end of the tub and tightens down the tub. Finally you can have hardline fittings which work the same as normal compression fittings but it's meant for hard tubing.   Tubing - soft flexible tubing or rigid tubing that you can bend by heating it with a heat gun. If you go this route look for PETG not acrylic.   Fluid - Distilled water if you want to go a cheap route.   That's a start I guess. Ha me and my mess of a comment. I do apologize about the format I'm on mobile and is hard for me to format plus it's 3:30 in the morning."
watercooling,38vixi,unhappyemo,1 point,Sun Jun 7 07:35:06 2015 UTC,What other fluids are there? Is there a popular choice for instance what people use for the nice green/pink liquids
watercooling,38vixi,Zarknox,2,Sun Jun 7 21:52:42 2015 UTC,EK's Coolants  Mayhems  A type of Pink  A Green as well  You'll have to do some research on how other people like certain colors and fluids because some last longer than others as well as used for different purposes like show coolant.
watercooling,38vixi,unhappyemo,1 point,Sun Jun 7 22:40:06 2015 UTC,Can you give me an idea how many liters a setup might use?
watercooling,38vixi,Zarknox,2,Sun Jun 7 22:44:12 2015 UTC,Oh dear well that all depends on how big your loop is. My current loop uses quite a lot since I have dual loops going with multiple rads and blocks and tall reservoirs I've used almost  4L. I'd say you would need no more than 1L for a small loop and 2L-3L for a standard/Large loop. I would advise buying one extra container of fluid in case you don't buy enough. If the off chance that you have to much you can always return the unopened fluid get your money back or save it for when you want to replace the fluid/clean your loop.
watercooling,38vixi,unhappyemo,1 point,Sun Jun 7 22:53:31 2015 UTC,"Do a lot of research, look on youtube. Depending on what you need look at a basic xspc or EK kit and then add gpu block if needed  http://www.performance-pcs.com/complete-kits  something like those kits would be a decent starter guide but you can expect to replace some of those parts in the future as you get into watercooling further."

watercooling,38v3ft,unhappyemo,3,Sun Jun 7 03:48:36 2015 UTC,Walmart should have a hand drill for a few bucks if you're able to find one there or your local hardware store even. It wouldn't even take long to put a hole through the case either since it's thin.
watercooling,38v3ft,Silverrune1997,2,Sun Jun 7 07:10:57 2015 UTC,"I lot of people don't like this setup. because the res isn't the highest point in the loop. I for one have a somewhat similar loop, the only thing that I worry about is noise from water dropping into the res."
watercooling,38v3ft,TheWatchmaker74,1 point,Sun Jun 7 02:38:14 2015 UTC,"Yeah, a bit after i posted I was reading further into the manual, and it said the top was recommended only as a fill port, and not as an inlet."

If they need to be disconnected, I can simply use the quick disconnect tube on the outside to ""U"" the  loop back into the machine it came from if need be.

Basically, they prevent clots from occurring when a patient is immobile for long periods of time.   If that's a SCD, anyways. It could be something else."
watercooling,38nn2f,Zachariahmandosa,5,Fri Jun 5 17:49:14 2015 UTC,Looks more like a cold water or cryotherapy device.  A lot of times after orthopedic surgeries the patient will get a system like this to take home and it keeps ice cold water running over the area to keep edema down.   Compression devices aren't really used at home almost ever.   The ice cold water would be pretty cool to get temps below ambient though.

Specs:  Gigabyte mATX G1 Gaming 5 Mobo  Core I5-4690k CPU  Nvidia Titan X GPU  16GB Corsair Vengeance RAM  Bitefenix 750W PSU  Bitefenix Aegis case  EK waterblocks for CPU and GPU as well as EK 240mm and 360mm radiators, all in one pump and reservoir. EK Pastel White concentrated coolant solution. Thermaltake 3/8"" tubing and 90 degree fittings (All I could find in the Perth WA area).  I am after some advice to re-design the tubing and pump layout so that the pump doesn't find itself at the exhaust of the front 360mm rad and to optimize airflow in the case. Note that the bends on the bottom two pieces of tubing are due to me rearranging the fan/radiator layout whereby the pump and reservoir were mounted onto a fan (bad vibration) and to allow the mounting of a 3.5"" drive bracket at the bottom of the case (replaced by a 120mm fan).  Currently, I have 7 120mm fans in this system. 4 in (filtered in push config at front and bottom) and 3 out (pull config at the back and top) = positive pressure (highly dusty environment).  I have also tried a negative pressure config with air intake from bottom and rear (unfiltered :[) and exhaust through the top and front (hot air hitting the front panel and exiting through the sides and bottom of that panel). Mounting the rear fan in that config is not possible due to the noise caused by air rushing through the grills. Marginal 2C temp drop on CPU and GPU.  Please let me know what your thoughts are as I am getting great temps while idle (CPU at 25-30C, PCH at 39C and GPU at 25C) but considerably higher max temps under load (CPU at 64C, PCH at 49C and GPU at 54C).

watercooling,38g3iw,Odd_It,1 point,Mon Jun 8 17:11:51 2015 UTC,"Indeed you can, however you should make sure it's designed to sterilise rather than just a standard black light, only downside is that the bulbs typically last 6 months.

watercooling,38g3iw,dazzawul,1 point,Mon Jun 8 18:09:48 2015 UTC,"Right got onto the PC - Bit of a read for you should you want to know more, how UV actually kills  tl;dr - UV fucks up the DNA /RNA mechanisms stopping the organisms replicating.   Having a quick look at actual units, typically they are enclosed in a opaque unit, as they are hazardous - because they also damage cells in human tissue. (If you are wanting a display black light, maybe have one for show - but the real deal will be hidden away!)  You may want to consider something along these lines, also looking at the wattage this one is 55W, so power is going to be an issue, think I saw lower power ones are around 30W.   It might also be worth looking to combine inline a microbial filter, this would be directly after the reservior to ensure you are getting a sterile feed into the loop, however this will be prone to blockage and also flow rates will be pitifully slow unless the pressure was really high and the pump was decent, really in the PC watercooling environment not really practical.  One thing I learnt from my years of experience, Bacteria will always certainly find a way to survive and in a watercooling loop, I would say without huge redesign and weekly maintenance microbial growth is inevitable.  Having a love of water systems (I know to some - not the most exciting things), in curiosity I came across this article part 1 and this part2, these articles suggest automotive additives, my first thought was to use centeral heating corrosion additive in the UK this is a main one Sentinel X100 as the temps of the loop in the PC will be very similar to central heating <100ºC.   If you are not running pure water (this would cause various corrosion issues - not a million miles from OP's issue), if you are running various mixes of inhibitors then exposing the solution to UV would cause potential photo-chemical effects that  would reduce the stability and performance of the solution in the loop.   tl;dr Essentially, UV may cause more problems than it solves, just use a decent inhibitor and change it regularly.  I enjoyed writing this post, and most likely I've missed huge bits out, if you have more questions or want more info, I will  happily help out!"

Most PC watercool enthusiasts use some form of corrosion inhibitor + algae prevention. But, I read A LOT about the science of it. And I happen to be an Engineer. With your system out of the sunlight, and water changed somewhat frequently (more than once a year), it's really unlikely to grow algae. As far as corrosion, it's only with dissimilar metals that are far apart on the Anodic Index. If you google it, you'll see how close together copper and nickel are, where silver is a bit farther away.   Who knows, I could be wrong, but I've never had any algae or corrosion and my loop has been running for 4 years solid, with water changeouts every 8-10 weeks as i stated above."

watercooling,38f1pv,Sorabella,1 point,Wed Jun 3 20:20:55 2015 UTC,Yes.  Part one is.  Part 2 neutralizes part 1 and make sure its pH neutral when you add your pastel/coolant.  Pastel coolant is very sensitive to pH balance according to Mayhem.
watercooling,38f1pv,Whitelabl,1 point,Thu Jun 4 04:56:39 2015 UTC,So basically the same as doing a vinegar wash and then rinsing with distilled a few times?
watercooling,38f1pv,Sorabella,1 point,Thu Jun 4 05:09:49 2015 UTC,"Not quite.   You can get away with the vinegar rinse on some of the rads, but specifically Alphacool rads are an exception (ATM).

watercooling,38f1pv,Whitelabl,1 point,Thu Jun 4 07:04:18 2015 UTC,"Why is it not the same?  I can't imagine the acid they give you is much stronger than 30-37% acetic acid.

watercooling,38f1pv,Sorabella,1 point,Thu Jun 4 15:19:25 2015 UTC,"From what i understand and from personal experience - they encourage us to use the blitz kit for Alphacool rads because they're filled with gunk/flux/etc.    And for the 2 Alphacool rads i owned, they're filthy dirty even when you do flush the rad (hot water, vinegar, distilled,  etc).   I have done the above and every 4 months or so, i take sample of the water and run it through a coffee filter.  Guess what?  Still have some gunk left.   I don't see that in my other rads.

watercooling,38d6z8,freewibblebon,2,Wed Jun 3 22:45:39 2015 UTC,Pumps work by using rotational force to apply waterpressure on the output and thus get the water moving.  This means that with nearly all common pumps the middle one in the in and the outer one is out.  Good example are plexi covers.

watercooling,38aysp,DeMoB,2,Wed Jun 3 04:40:01 2015 UTC,Something like UN Designs Z2/Z3 Brackets or EK's UNI pump holder should do the trick?

watercooling,3897g9,sodope28,1 point,Tue Jun 2 18:46:11 2015 UTC,"Any case will support water cooling. Whether or not you need to drill holes and add support for a radiator is another story. Usually if going for a slimmer radiator you'll need 50-60mm clearance to allow for fans as well. For your system you need a Min of 360mm radiator space. (could be 3x120, 2x120 + 120 etc."
watercooling,3897g9,Kautkto,1 point,Tue Jun 2 20:57:16 2015 UTC,If you've got 400 to 600$ to spend you should be able to upgrade to decent watercooling case and have plenty of money for the build.   Getting a case designed for water cooling will make things so much easier for you. Especially if this is the first time you've watercooled. Take a look at some of the fractal or phanteks cases.
watercooling,3897g9,crbrown3,1 point,Tue Jun 2 21:03:37 2015 UTC,I would recommend switching to something like the fractal define s or the corsair air 540 so easy water cooling support
watercooling,3878n6,JordonBrooker,1 point,Tue Jun 2 10:21:39 2015 UTC,"to be honest, the XL R2 isn't that great of a water cooling beast. Sure it is big but it really only supports 2x120 or 2x140 radiators up the top.  So you're looking at the Kelvin S24 if you want a Fractal all-in-one system."

watercooling,388jtq,Skaiar,2,Tue Jun 2 16:41:25 2015 UTC,"If you're using PETG tubing, you'll probably get Primochill 12mm tubing which comes in 4x3ft packs or 36ft packs.  the 12ft is more than enough, but you should get 36ft to fuck around with in my opinion. You could want to try different loops or paths or whatever. This tubing also has an actual OD of 12.7mm so you will need to sand the outside to bring the OD down, unless you use primochill rigid revolver fittings.   I personally use rigid revolvers for that very reason and they work great. Loop's been running for 6 months with no problems.   Using a res with a built in pump or not built in makes no difference. Just your personal preference. I like the photon 270, but i had to use the EK 170 thing because of space concerns in my 760T.   a 480mm is more than enough rad space, but if you have the money you should probably throw a 360 up top or a 240/280 in the basement as well as the 480."

watercooling,387ems,ICBreaker,2,Tue Jun 2 11:36:50 2015 UTC,"You can also check when buying your waterblock to see if it is compatible with other cards for example, the XSPC Razor GTX or koolance VID-NXTTN2 are compatible with the 780 and the titan series so if you decide to upgrade later you can put those waterblock to use.  Also you probably already know it but some nice fan with good static pressure (depending on your radiator) and low noise are really nice."
watercooling,387ems,onsenrparle,2,Tue Jun 2 13:09:47 2015 UTC,"Ah nice! I didn't know some waterblocks could be swapped between cards! The XSPC looks really nice! I also don't know about fans with good static pressure. I'm assuming bigger fans means lower rpm and low noise, but I don't think I can fit a big fan in my case... the P280 is really nice for a medium tower, but I'm afraid I won't be able to fit too much stuff in here."
watercooling,387ems,onsenrparle,1 point,Tue Jun 2 13:30:17 2015 UTC,The size of the fans will depend on the size of the radiator you choose. As you said the bigger fan tends to have lower rpm and less noise but the FPI of your radiator will also influence the noise. A higher FPI means better performance but needs higher pressure fan and cause more noise.
watercooling,387ems,Kautkto,2,Tue Jun 2 13:43:54 2015 UTC,"P280 not so great for water cooling, minimal radiator mounts without modification. it's great for air cooling though. My last rig..."

watercooling,387ems,napoleon85,1 point,Tue Jun 2 21:54:23 2015 UTC,"That was actually my experiment with hard tubing. I've completely rebuilt in a case designed for it but waiting on a few parts before I do a photoshoot.   Used an aqualis reservoir (only res worth getting imho), primochill petg, bit power fittings for the soft tubing and primochill revolver for the hard, ek blocks on gpu and CPU (changed to a heat killer block on the CPU and added mobo cooling), d5 pump (the aqualis has an adapter if you want to directly connect a pump to the base) and an rx 360 radiator."
watercooling,387ems,napoleon85,1 point,Tue Jun 2 22:03:40 2015 UTC,"With my current PSU, can I upgrade to a watercooling GPU?   You should be OK unless you plan on using a modified BIOS to send more power through the 780. You will definitely want a bigger PSU when you add the second 780. I recommend the EVGA 1000P2 or 1200P2. They have very clean power output and a ten year warranty, as well as being fully modular.   I have simply no idea what's the difference between Acetal, Nickel, Acetal+Nickel   Acetal is the cover on the ""top"" of the assembly, it's cosmetic and does not affect performance, but some people prefer it to the clear plastic look. Nickel means the copper block is electroplated with nickel. No real increase in performance, but it is resistant to getting the patina look that copper is prone to. It really comes down to a matter of personal preference.   Do I need a backplate?   Not on a 780, it would make for a cleaner look and protect the back of the card, but it's cosmetic.   In fact, which other parts are mandatory for me to complete my watercooling? I'm guessing a reservoir, pump, fittings, tubbing and a radiator.   Nailed it, just need coolant that either contains a biocide, or some other form of biocide.  Also, just another thought. If you're planning on upgrading, why not buy a 980 or 980 Ti? I just recently put my 780s on water, but that is only because I already had two and the waterblocks had been purchased some time ago (prior to the 900 series launch)."
watercooling,387ems,niceandcreamy,2,Tue Jun 2 12:15:13 2015 UTC,"Thank you very much for your answer. I checked your build (very nice btw) before posting my questions and was kinda hoping you'd comment on it!  Now as for why don't I buy a 980 or a 980Ti is the fact that I already have a 780. A 980Ti is around 800€, and I'd rather spend money on a second hand 780 that I can get for 300€, add some watercooling parts to it for 400€ than a brand new GPU. This might be dumb actually I don't know. I'm just waiting on the next AMD cards to see what the fuss is all about.  But as far as I know, the difference between a 780 and a 980 is not that great, at least not enough to justify an upgrade."
watercooling,387ems,napoleon85,0,Tue Jun 2 12:36:16 2015 UTC,"True, but the difference between a single 780 and 980 Ti is very significant ... It all depends on your current budget and goals though."

watercooling,387ems,napoleon85,1 point,Tue Jun 2 16:42:22 2015 UTC,Never said my settings were maxed. Games don't really need that much post-processing because of the higher pixel density at 1440p.

watercooling,387xs5,voxelnoose,1 point,Tue Jun 2 15:00:42 2015 UTC,"EK's terminology is kind of confusing. They have 3 different systems. The original FC link, the CSQ Bridge, and the new FC Terminal. If your block looks like THIS then it is an FC Terminal. If it looks like THIS its a CSQ. If it looks like THIS Then it uses the old style FC link. I have ordered them in the likelihood that a new block would use them: Most new blocks are FC terminal, CSQ is still sold but fewer models, and the old FC Link is no longer sold at all. In the case of CSQ and the old FC link system, there were two parts involved: a part (""link"") that attached to the front of the waterblock that was basically a 90deg fitting, and then the ""bridge"" between all the cards. Luckily with the FC terminal system the only part that you need to worry about is the bridge (""terminal"" in their new parlance)."
watercooling,387xs5,Owan,1 point,Tue Jun 2 15:22:58 2015 UTC,Hmm okay thanks. I kinda wanted to be able to use the bridge since it's the flattest (smoothest) and I wanted to engrave something on it.

watercooling,387xs5,Kautkto,1 point,Tue Jun 2 16:57:55 2015 UTC,"If you're going to use those slots it might be slightly more complex because that would be 4 slot spacing and there are no dual gpu 4-slot bridges. I think you can use one of these with the appropriate blanking plate on the middle opening, but I'd double check spacing before buying anything. There is also a serial version of the same fitting with a serial blanking plate, if you'd rather go serial vs parallel."
watercooling,387xs5,ICanHazTehCookie,1 point,Tue Jun 2 17:11:59 2015 UTC,I'd prefer parallel. And I'll have to look into the spacing. I'm using the first and third slots on the board but I think it's spaced more widely.
watercooling,387xs5,Owan,1 point,Tue Jun 2 17:26:57 2015 UTC,FYI the third slot (grey) is only PCIe 2.0 x4 electrically and shares bandwidth with a bunch of other add-on chips. If you want to put 2 GPU's in there I wouldn't recommend putting it in that slot.

Don't be filling your reservoir as your pump is going as you may make a mistake trying to keep up with the pump.  Yes, fill it till it levels out.  Bleed your loop.  Yes leak testing with paper towel is a good idear.  If you can, since you don't have any tubing in yet, flush at least your radiators as they are usually the component with the most gunk in them.  If you were to run it without flushing, particles may get trapped in blocks regardless if you use regular water or coolant."

There's really only one that I want to work on and it's because I didn't run it right when I put the gpu block back on.

watercooling,3841hp,nono0044,2,Mon Jun 1 21:29:15 2015 UTC,"I'd get some 45 and 90 degree adapters, and change up the tubing like so:   Top rad to cpu is fine  Then go from cpu to gpu terminal top. Depending if you like those long runs to and from the bottom rad, you can turn it around and use adapters to get to the rad and pump Not sure if the space behind the case allows, but you can try to go from pump to the grommet thats closest to the pump, then up the back of the case and use some angle adapters to go through the top left grommet to get back to the top rad."

watercooling,383gbq,cvance10,2,Mon Jun 1 16:51:33 2015 UTC,"Can't attest to this personally (YET) but it seems like the D5 is the way to go, it can make some noise if you work it hard, but it's more than enough pump for all but the most complicated setups, so you can usually run it slower hence it ends up being fairly quiet (reportedly anyway)"
watercooling,383gbq,PAPO1990,2,Mon Jun 1 16:18:43 2015 UTC,"Have you looked into anti-vibration mounts for your current pump before spending big on a new unit? I've never heard of a DDC being so loud it needed ghetto mounting just to deal with the sound.  I run a D5 Vario at setting 3, on anti-vibe mounts, and it's inaudible at 1'."
watercooling,383gbq,Nyxi26,1 point,Mon Jun 1 16:42:24 2015 UTC,"Instead of buying a D5, you could get an adapter like this one and connect your pump to a 3 pin mainboard/external fan controller. DDC pumps can be undervolted to 40% / 5V, that's around 2000rpm. Basically inaudible and yet powerful enough for a watercooling loop."
watercooling,383gbq,domp_,1 point,Mon Jun 1 17:17:18 2015 UTC,"Good points here so far. You need a stiff structure to attach the pump to. Heavy helps as well. An example of a bad place would be the middle of a wobbly steel side panel, which will act as a loudspeaker for any vibrations the pump produces.   If you can get your hands on a steel or copper or lead plate, the pump won't be able to excite a 1 pound plate to vibrations (not enough energy). You can get scrap steel pieces at any machining shop for a buck or two. Lead is harder to get and copper is slightly more expensive per kilogram these days.  Isolating the pump with small rubber isolators is also a good idea. I am not a big fan of the shoggy sandwich, it started out as a ghetto solution itself and as an engineer whose job is antivibration related, complete isolation is only achievable if the connection is through rubber only. A sponge should stay a sponge. That is not to say it won't work, I just have professional prejudice against it.  Best of all would be make the pump heavy with an extra plate, and then mount that with isolators.  My Innovatek HPPS is mounted sideways on the inside of my 3.5 inch drive bays. I have it set on auto, when the PC starts up you can hear it spin to max and then settle down to nominal, where it is inaudible."

watercooling,384ees,h5b123,2,Fri Jul 17 08:34:14 2015 UTC,"Ugh, so I'm kind of taking a break at the moment with it, my plan was to have a 140mm rad on the front intake, a 92mm rad on the top rear fan mount of the case, and attached to the removable back panel another 92mm rad, and that should work, but I didn't realise how annoying it would be to access my IO ports in the back if I did that.  I am now considering doing a CPU only loop for my fiances build using this case and just not using that third radiator attached to the back panel.  I have been thinking about picking up the In-Win 909 when it drops this fall for my main build, or grabbing a caselabs mercury s5.  I'm rather disappointed I couldn't make it work.  The only thing I was thinking to salvage it was sandwiching those 2 92mm rads together on that 92mm rear slot but I have no idea how to mount them together like that, I just don't like the idea of not being able to remove that back panel with a radiator attached to it."
watercooling,384ees,h5b123,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:57:56 2015 UTC,"That sucks, yeah I have been planning this case for 3 months now, just ordered 1/2 of the components yesterday. My plan is a bit different, full cooling loop for CPU and GPU like yours, but 2 rads on the front intake, and 1 rad mounted on the rear panel.  AND, i plan to do Hard tubing, which is crazy and stupid haha. I just realized that if you have to connect something, you have to take to rear panel off. So my solution is getting 2 Female-to-female adapter for the tubes, so i can use regular tubing on the back, making it easier to take the panel off without draining the whole loop every single time. Albeit i will have to turn off the pc and psu before plugging anything in :D But that's what SSD is for  I wanted the 909 as well, but after hearing the price is around 450usd, in eu would be around 450euro as well, so that's a no for me.

watercooling,384ees,h5b123,2,Sun Jul 19 11:32:53 2015 UTC,"That's not a bad idea, do note though with this case, depending on the size of the rear radiator you do, you can mount it instead of on the back removable panel, you can mount it to the outside of the rear fan mount on the back of the case, the inside of that is a 92mm fan mount but the outside doesn't have as restrictive space.  You might be able to make that work without attaching it to the removable panel.  I'm doing rigid as well.  :D I'd appreciate it if you kept me updated on your build, since I'm taking a break with mine, if you can make yours work maybe I'll give it another try.  I'm doing rigid as well, 12mm OD, it was the only size I could get to fit along the back side without touching the glass panel."

watercooling,382v1h,Kautkto,1 point,Mon Jun 1 19:09:10 2015 UTC,Yes. Usually the pump adds around 15 watts of heat to a loop. But a decent 240mm radiator can handle around 375 watts of heat with fans going.

But you don't really need a controller.  Your mobo has 4 sys fan connectors and 2 cpu fan connectors.  4 splitters means 2 fans per sys fan connectors.

And as others have said there are also ""fan hubs"" like this. Phanteks makes a popular PWM one that is included with many of their cases. Theirs is powered by either main 4-pin motherboard ""CPU Fan"" pins with an included cable or by a SATA power cable from your PSU, as opposed to molex.

Tubing is also inexpensive so you can pick out whatever you like. Fittings can be expensive depending on how many you need, and what type you buy. Fans can range in price depending on what you are interested in buying, the general rule with this is to get something with high static pressure, there are some tests people have run with different fans that you can read.

So you could take it apart and if it's the o ring, no big deal, you fix it, but your block would no longer be covered by EK. Or you could risk the shipping cost and send it to EK."

watercooling,3805k4,Kautkto,1 point,Mon Jun 1 03:12:39 2015 UTC,Thanks for your response!  The Blocks in this loop will consist of:  -2x XSPC EX240 Copper Dual-Fan Radiator link  -EK Supremacy EVO CPU Block link  -EK-FC970 GTX WF3 - Nickel link  Are you suggesting that I use two pumps and create two separate loops?
watercooling,3805k4,Kautkto,2,Mon Jun 1 11:07:51 2015 UTC,"Why the two reservoirs? The rads and blocks are low restriction so shouldn't be an issue for a single d5. But regardless, no pump will maintain decent flow if you have the pressure drop from two reservoirs."
watercooling,3805k4,conet,1 point,Mon Jun 1 11:40:26 2015 UTC,"Let me give you some additional information:  -I have experience with typical loops in traditional case styles  -I am helping a friend build this loop and it is going to be a desk build. There is no budget on the build and efficiency is not the goal. The goal is purely aesthetics and I want to do whatever it takes to successfully give my friend the layout that he wants.   I have never dealt with a loop this long or configured in this way   Flow Pic  -There is a slight incline where the MOBO is. This is a preliminary sketch and the black dots represent roughly where the fittings will go.   Will HOW CAN I make this loop work? Should i dedicate one pump to each side of the configuration? Again I am not concerned with efficiency of the design, I would just like to know the best way to get a system running with this sort of layout."
watercooling,3805k4,Kautkto,2,Mon Jun 1 12:44:07 2015 UTC,"Pump at the high point and above the reservoirs? I mean it could work but you'll need to push the desk over so the pump is at the bottom to bleed it. And even then it can't have ANY air in the loop. Unless we're looking at the underside of a desk, in which case disregard everything but the bleeding part."

watercooling,37xjm3,Kautkto,1 point,Sun May 31 15:42:20 2015 UTC,".  I would suggest going for the 3' petg tubing over acrylic, much easier to work with and doesn't suffer from pressure cracks if the tubing isn't exactly right. Also no need for an extender then either. It's not as clear when held up to the light but it's only something like 3% difference."
watercooling,37xjm3,Kautkto,1 point,Mon Jun 1 08:29:00 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the advice.  Yeah, the reason I wanted acrylic was for the clarity.  Also, PETG is permeable, which would cause the tubing to swell over time.   But you're right, I might go with PETG.  I'll have to weigh the pros and cons again.  How necessary or useful do you think the Monsoon Mandrel Kit is?  I really don't want to spend the $40, but this will be my first time doing this, so if it'll make a difference, I'll go ahead and sell afterwards perhaps."
watercooling,37xjm3,Kautkto,1 point,Mon Jun 1 16:45:46 2015 UTC,"Petg shouldn't end up swelling. Mandrel kit could be useful but it doesn't allow bends to be as tight as they could. I bought it, and then ended up freehanding the lot."

watercooling,37qi2u,RaveDigger,3,Fri May 29 16:20:50 2015 UTC,"You can make a case with no fans, but it still needs vents so the hot air can rise, if it sealed off then it will gradually get hotter and hotter.  My computer has an i5-2500k and an r9-290 oc'd to 1200mhz and can be run without fans using a 360mm radiator and 140mm radiator.  However I cannot game without fans on, anything that uses the graphics cards means the fans have to be on to dissapate that 200+ watts of heat given off by the graphics card.  Or you can seal off your case and put the radiators outside of the case, but the inside still might get hot due to the heat coming off the motherboard and residual heat from the graphics card.  I would never seal off the case completely, you could vent it though and put radiators on the outside.  Fan filters work pretty well though.  Just invest in thick nice filters if you are worried about dust, they might be more restictive to airflow but would help a lot with dust.  Personally I like a nice thing fan filter to not impede air flow, but to still catch large dust particles."
watercooling,37qi2u,DarthBories,1 point,Fri May 29 16:57:17 2015 UTC,"I think it's possible, but you'd be talking low power stuff. You'd probably want to underclock, even. Then you could just run the whole thing passive without fans, and maybe rig the rads on the outside of the case. Or rig the whole thing so that the output panel is on top of the case, and have a big gigantic low RPM fan on the bottom, with the rad in the air path, and just let the gentle breeze lightly push the heat upwards, as hot air wants to move.   Something like this.  Note: I am just spitballin' here. Don't take any of this as expert advice. I just think that it's possible."
watercooling,37qi2u,El_Dubious_Mung,1 point,Fri May 29 16:30:44 2015 UTC,If you dust filter all of your intakes and keep positive air pressure in your case it will prevent most dust from entering.

watercooling,37pt1m,Chucky1985,2,Fri May 29 13:15:48 2015 UTC,Loop order means very little. Any gain from the cooler water is probably offset by splitting the flow in half.
watercooling,37pt1m,TreeFiddy1031,2,Fri May 29 13:53:00 2015 UTC,"You can do that, but you have to be careful about flow rates. GPU blocks are normally much less restrictive than CPU blocks, so you'll end up with the majority of the coolant going through the GPU branch instead of the CPU branch. Flow rate isn't usually a big deal, but if the disparity is large then you may end up in territory where your CPU temps start to suffer.  Secondly, although the net flow is increased due to the reduced impedance, the flow through each of the components is reduced. Certain water blocks rely on turbulence to function optimally, and reduced flow rates will reduce this effect."

My case is also a 900D so if I was going to do dual loops my SLI'd graphics would have one 480mm radiator and my CPU would have the other 480mm radiator.  That doesn't really make sense when the CPU has a TDP of 130 Watts (3930K) but my dual GTX 780's have a TDP of 250 Watts, each. The graphics need much more cooling than my CPU.  So it makes more sense to just combine the radiators in to one loop so the three components can share the total radiator capacity for better overall cooling.  That's how I did it and my CPU and Graphics run very cool, even with quite high (30%) overclocks.  Looking beyond performance, aesthetically dual loops can sometimes look nice, especially in those super large case labs cases where you need something to fill the extra space, but usually it just looks overly complicated and messy with tubes all over the place."

Then we get into the rads. In OPs build each loop has 480mm of cooling space. Since the fluid moves so quick (and he has decent blocks) you can get better temps with a combined 960mm of cooling area.  My advise would be to convert to single loop and get a dual pump head. It would run cooler and have some redundancy. It doesn't look like he had a controller for pumps/fans so I would get one of those too.  Nice rig though!"

watercooling,37myxy,83GTI,2,Thu May 28 20:35:30 2015 UTC,"Building inside an Air 540 is tight. I don't know about fitting a 60mm on top. I would stick with a 45. I like Alphacool rads. Again, space is very tight. You'll just have to measure your free space and see if you can fit a tube res in there."
watercooling,37myxy,PC_Builder12,1 point,Thu May 28 23:02:22 2015 UTC,"Thank you. I'm gonna just stick with a 45 up top. I've pretty much gone through and answered all my own questions, but have one left. I really want to just stick with all fans (that are visible in the case) being the Corsair ones with the white ring. And for that reason I am thinking about getting a 240mm rad for the top so that I can use 2/4 of the SP120s for the rad and 3 of the AF120s in the front to blow air over the GPUs. So the difference between the radiators would be negligible correct?"
watercooling,37myxy,PC_Builder12,2,Thu May 28 23:16:59 2015 UTC,"It would be. The general rule is 120mm per block, with an extra 120mm for OC. If all you're cooling is your CPU, 240mm is perfect. If you want to add your GPU into the loop, you'll need to put another 240 or 360 in the front."

watercooling,37myxy,PC_Builder12,2,Fri May 29 06:10:30 2015 UTC,So as I'm going through and adding stuff to my cart... I found one more question for you (sorry). What should I do for the pump to allow me to use my own custom fittings on it instead of the 1/2 inch barbs? I want to use my monsoon 3/8 compression fittings. I have found some addon things but I don't understand how they work. Will I have to buy a pump that doesn't have a top?
watercooling,37myxy,PC_Builder12,1 point,Fri May 29 06:51:35 2015 UTC,"No, if you buy a pump with a top, it should have standard 1/4 fitting threads. Then you simply screw in your monsoon 3/8 compression fittings and it will work like a charm."
watercooling,37myxy,Andrej_ID,1 point,Fri May 29 15:50:17 2015 UTC,"Oh! Okay. Sorry most of the ones I was seeing had the plastic 1/2 barb adapters. If it's not too much to ask could you maybe link me one of the ones that you're referring to? Preferably Amazon, but any site is fine."
watercooling,37l50g,kasuno,2,Thu May 28 12:43:15 2015 UTC,"a bleed port is somewhere in your loop that you can open up to vent air that escapes. Usually they are in the reservoir as the bubbles should wind up there eventually. A lot of reservoirs come with extra ports that are available above the coolant line. It should be as simple as popping one of them open, venting the air that has collected from bleeding your system of bubbles."
watercooling,37l50g,moto_bandit,6,Thu May 28 13:47:42 2015 UTC,"Further expanding on this, bubbles in your cooling loop are like bubbles in your blood vessels, and will ruin your life."
watercooling,37l50g,FoxHoundUnit89,2,Thu May 28 14:59:51 2015 UTC,Expanding on the expanding.  Air doesn't transfer heat. So bubbles (= air) straight off limit any cooling possiblity.   My Computer Store contact told me the story of an CPU that was reaching 100 degree temps because he had an airbubble in the CPU waterblock. Makes sense since the airbubble blocks all heat transfer.  Directly above you CPU it will be murderous.
watercooling,37l50g,kerel,1 point,Fri May 29 13:18:11 2015 UTC,"Yes the most common way to ""bleed"" the loop is wait for the air bubbles to all make it to the reservoir then ""fill it out"" with more water. Yeah, radiators are a common place for air to get caught too so shaking or tilting the case can help move them along (easier said than done for some people depending on case size and weight)."

watercooling,37irph,kerel,1 point,Fri May 29 14:02:18 2015 UTC,"Solid advice.  I would say though that heat guns don't seem to fall into this slot as much as other tools when used infrequently.  I have both a DeWalt one and a Black and Decker cheap and cheerful one.  Whilst the big boy DeWalt is clearly a better tool, if you're not doing a fair bit of paint stripping or something it doesn't really offer much over the basic B&D one.  It'll no doubt last longer, but if you only use a heat gun for bending and heat shrink, even a cheap one should last years.  Drills, jigsaws etc. on the other hand really benefit from that advice as you'll get much better results from the get go.  Good tools just make everything nicer."
watercooling,37irph,Makirole,4,Thu May 28 09:28:45 2015 UTC,Is this a serious question?? You're about to drop ridiculous amount of money (probably) on components for a custom loop and don't want to spend a couple bucks on a heat gun? Coming from experience your project will only come out looking nice if you use the proper tools. I got my heatgun for something like 20-30 bucks online.
watercooling,37irph,tospace2006,2,Thu May 28 00:10:51 2015 UTC,"A hairdryer would require you to hold it at the tubing for way way longer, and you could potentially burn out the hairdryer.    Don't use and open flame like a lighter, it blackens the tubing.  Just save yourself the grief and grab the cheapest heat gun at your hardware store."
watercooling,37irph,nono0044,1 point,Thu May 28 00:13:24 2015 UTC,"I had the same question initially and eventually went with a heat gun because pretty much everyone recommended one. I can say, while it didn't make it any 'easier', I can think of a few issues that a regular hair dryer or an open flame would bring about.  A regular plain hair dryer might simply not be able to get the air hot enough to allow the material you are trying to bend, be it Acrylic or PETG, to get soft enough to bend without artifacts.  An open flame may be worse still as it would be pretty tough to accurately adjust the temperature or even keep it steady. Also, there is the possibility that it could cause discoloration on the material.  Either way, even with a heat gun, you risk blemishing the material by making it too hot or by trying to bend while it is still cold. So I'd say get the right tool for the job, a heat gun, and some extra material so you can practice before making something you'll put into your final build.  This heat gun is in the right watt range for what you want to do and appears to have pretty good reviews, however, I own a different one so I'm not so sure how good it actually is.  http://www.amazon.com/Wagner-0503008-HT1000-200-watt-Heat/dp/B00004TUCV/ref=lp_13837381_1_1/182-9833459-1349403?s=hi&ie=UTF8&qid=1432768076&sr=1-1"
watercooling,37irph,NullShot,1 point,Wed May 27 23:19:42 2015 UTC,"but that introduces the need for a bender, which costs more than a heat gun."
watercooling,37irph,Sorabella,1 point,Thu May 28 01:17:28 2015 UTC,"eh, renting one costs as much as buying a heat gun.  There's no financial argument unless you're doing a lot of bending for some reason. But in that case you'd already have a bender.   Heat guns are also really cool."

watercooling,37irph,Monroeshindelar,1 point,Thu May 28 03:14:47 2015 UTC,It depends on the brand and exact mix of the tubing material. Some works far better with a heat gun. Others can bend of with a STRONG and focused hair dryer.  I find a heat gun lets you really focus the heat for tighter bends and better use on heat shrink too.  Cheap one will do. They aren't overly complex tools. Plenty on amazon prime for around $20.

watercooling,37i0s2,niceandcreamy,5,Fri May 29 13:51:52 2015 UTC,Mainly because it takes so much work as you have to build the desk completely custom.
watercooling,37i0s2,niceandcreamy,3,Wed May 27 20:03:16 2015 UTC,Custom or you buy a desk with a case under the glass for the cost of the components you are putting in it.
watercooling,37i0s2,niceandcreamy,1 point,Wed May 27 20:27:33 2015 UTC,Please elaborate
watercooling,37i0s2,niceandcreamy,3,Wed May 27 21:06:44 2015 UTC,Most desks that can fit watercooling gear in them have a glass top with the case right underneath it so you can see all of the goodies inside. They can go anywhere from $800 for a small one to thousands for a normal sized desk. For that money most people can build a lovely watercooled computer that isn't the size of a desk.

watercooling,37flmj,jamesisninja,1 point,Wed May 27 07:15:49 2015 UTC,"You do need rigid fittings. Standard compression fittings will not work. I'd recommend either the Primochill Rigid Revolver or Bitspower Multi-Link fittings.  I don't think hard tubing comes in multiple sizes. I've only ever seen 3/8x1/2.  Aso, using a cross flow radiator for your fromt radiator might make the tubing a bit easier."
watercooling,37flmj,xNPi,1 point,Wed May 27 08:00:07 2015 UTC,"Both EK and Bitspower make 12mm OD or 16mm OD, so alongside the primochill 1/2"" OD, there are different sizes.  If he can line it up right, with some 90 degree fittings means he could just have a run that goes straight down, instead of having to try to line up and tighten everything with the ports of the x-flow and pump so close."
watercooling,37flmj,nono0044,1 point,Wed May 27 15:03:23 2015 UTC,Just curious ... Why not try soft tubing for your first build? :)

watercooling,37flmj,Nyxi26,1 point,Wed May 27 21:20:16 2015 UTC,"Yes you will need different fittings for hardline and yes there are different sizes of tubing. For example, Bitspower/Barrow fittings generally support tubing that is 12/10mm whereas Primochill support tubing that is 13/10mm. I use the Primochill hardline compression fittings which do come in black.  You will also need either tools for bending, or angled fittings. Don't forget to include either of these in your budget!  I'm uncertain re the pump top question, but I also don't know whether having two outlet ports open at once (ie to drain) is a good idea because it could introduce air to the pump. I just used a T fitting for my drain port, works fine.   If you're buying a res top adapter for a D5 anyway why not just get a combo unit like EK's D5 X-RES? Might be cheaper."

I picked up a male-male rotary coupling and was going to attached the inlet of the pump directly to the outlet of the reservoir. Will this cause any weird issues in the water loop?
watercooling,37bqpx,eudisld15,1 point,Tue May 26 17:08:31 2015 UTC,"It is basically the same thing as a tubed connection. Just check for leaks and you should be set. You're going to Want to feed the outlet of the res. to the inlet of the pump though, make filling much easier and could potentially prevent damage to your pump when you're filling up since the pump will be the last one to receive water (if you turn on the pump during filling)"

watercooling,3784c8,Commander_Chiggs,3,Mon May 25 19:57:22 2015 UTC,"Generally speaking quieter fans move less air and depending on the fin density of your radiator the air pressure can make a big difference in cooling performance.  For example a radiator with a high fin density(21+ fins per inch) will need a higher air pressure to move air through it and as quiet fans typically move less air they don't work as well in these radiators.  However if the density is lower than 13 fins per inch pressure becomes less of a factor, so if your radiator has a lower density quiet fans should be fine. Hope this helps!"

watercooling,3784c8,Whitelabl,1 point,Mon May 25 20:30:17 2015 UTC,"Well 16 fpi is in the low-middle range of radiator density and considering that is a slim radiator, you probably won't see that much benefit from using a high pressure fan.  However if you are planning on doing intense overclocking, running 24/7 stress tests, hard-core gaming, and on cooling more than two components with that radiator you likely won't need the extra cooling that stronger fans will give you, but if you are then go with a radiator that has a higher fpi and is thicker (if space isn't an issue in your case) and use high performance fans."

watercooling,377yb4,specikk,2,Mon May 25 16:51:44 2015 UTC,"Don't quote me on this, but you could use a coupler and run some flexible tubing, give a decent amount of slack and add a quick disconnect in the middle, and another coupler to hardline again."
watercooling,377yb4,Chessel,1 point,Wed May 27 21:42:19 2015 UTC,"I really don't think you can put any QD in a hard tubing build.  In order to disconnect the QD you need to have flexibility in the tubing.  If you were to try that with acrylic, unless you were really really careful, it probably will crack the tubing.    As for a flow meter, it depends how you set it up.  You can use a male to male extension to go directly from a component to the flow meter, then use a hard fitting to go to tubing.    Here is what I did. Gpu block to 90 degree, to m2m, to flow, to fitting."
watercooling,377yb4,nono0044,1 point,Mon May 25 19:00:15 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the response.  Yeah, I'm planning on having the part of the build that isn't visible use soft tubing so that I can put the QD there along with things like the flow meter. I I use the QD for draining purposes, so maybe I'd be better off getting a different fitting for draining, perhaps a valve I can attach to a T-junction."
watercooling,377yb4,nono0044,1 point,Mon May 25 21:28:43 2015 UTC,Yeah thats the go-to option that you see in a lot of hard tubing builds.  A valve coming off a t-junction connected to a front rad or pump is usually the best bet.
watercooling,377yb4,Kautkto,1 point,Mon May 25 21:31:00 2015 UTC,"I used outdoor 20lb 3m adhesive tape to stick my flow meter on the front panel under the 240 radiator in the flex bay.

watercooling,376pbt,kasuno,3,Mon May 25 09:25:28 2015 UTC,"acetel just refers to the cover over the copper/nickel plated copper block that contacts the cpu, there is no real difference in temps between copper and nickel blocks, or blocks with copper/acetel/acrylic tops.

watercooling,376pbt,voxelnoose,2,Mon May 25 10:26:37 2015 UTC,"AFAIK, the EK Supremacy EVO performs best from the testing I've seen. I'm no EK fanboy, that just seems to be the case.   Acetal is the plastic part of the block, it doesn't impact temps. Acetal can't be clear like plexi/acrylic can (it's usually matte black in color), but it's more durable and doesn't crack as easily.   ""Nickel"" means ""copper electroplated with a very thin layer of nickel"". It doesn't impact temps (maybe copper is better by a fraction of a degree if anything), but the nickel version doesn't develop a patina like copper does (again, irrelevant for temps). It's also easier to remove Coollaboratory stuff from nickel than copper."

watercooling,376fij,xxSQUASHIExx,2,Mon May 25 07:05:17 2015 UTC,"Not sure exactly what you mean by ""on it's back"" so I'll clarify. You'll want to either have the pump on the side (like in the picture), or the pump on the bottom with the pump top above it. The reason is that gravity will keep the pump full of fluid.  If you have the pump on top, you have two problems:   Priming the pump to make sure there is no air inside Making sure no air gets into the pump during use   Centrifugal pumps cannot prime themselves nor can they pump vapor or gas, so if it catches enough bubbles you're SOL."
watercooling,376fij,Unknown_Caker,1 point,Mon May 25 07:38:27 2015 UTC,I meant the pump laying on the back side of the motor.  Basically the face of the pump would be facing the ceiling.

watercooling,376fij,Shermanpk,2,Mon May 25 08:36:25 2015 UTC,"While it isn't good practice, if you had a reservoir above it, it would work. But yeah, I wouldn't ever do that in real life if it was cooling components or if I wanted the pump to last. Don't put your pump with the inlet facing down; but it probably wouldn't break it."

watercooling,374xx6,eQuiFY,1 point,Mon May 25 09:21:43 2015 UTC,"Remember one thing, if you are going for hard tubing then you also need to buy pump top. Lowest pump top that you can get is by XSPC for $30.  So if you buy separate parts, it would be:   Pump ~$90 (if you are going D5 PWM) Pump top $30 and onwards Reservoir $50 and onwards   This combo is for D5 pumps, it is different for different version but that's what I prefer."
watercooling,374xx6,Andrej_ID,1 point,Mon May 25 13:53:53 2015 UTC,"Personally, I think combo is better. It's much easier since you don't have to think much about positioning res and pump separately in the case. And since you are building in Define S, I think combo is the best choice."
watercooling,374xx6,conet,1 point,Tue May 26 07:28:58 2015 UTC,I like the combo from the perspective of mounting. Saves a set of holes that need to be drilled. Plus I think they look better.

I'm leaning toward the Enthoos Primo case which can fit a triple 140 on top, a double 140 on the bottom, and a single 140 in the rear.  Will a 420 rad @ 600RPM meet my goals? Should I add a 280 rad as well?  Can the D5 pump support CPU, two GPUs, and two radiators?  Any suggestions for the best low-speed fan radiator?"

watercooling,36z08j,asura123,2,Sun May 24 13:52:41 2015 UTC,"A 360 up front will be a tight squeeze depending upon how the end with the ports extends. The cables for the front panel connections stick down on the top. This is the reason I went with a 240 in mine.  Plus having an inlet fan of fresh air never hurt, so you could so the 240mm up front with a third 120mm above it for fresh air."
watercooling,36z08j,asura123,2,Sat May 23 14:21:22 2015 UTC,"I was weighing this up too, ended up opting to go a 360 up top and a 120 at the back instead of anything in the front. However am now contemplating a 240 in the front as well just gotta see whether I can fit it into my current time plan."
watercooling,36z08j,asura123,1 point,Tue May 26 02:43:31 2015 UTC,"So the problem with the H440 is definitely going to be standard airflow regardless of how you place your radiators. In my build I put a 360 at top and 240 for intake so that I could keep 2 of my hard drive cages (although one had to be modified.) However, temps were much higher than usual watercooling. Ultimately I cut holes into the the top and side panels and placed a mesh on them dropping temps 20 degrees C. As a side note when testing I found the front cut led to 15 degree drop while top panel led to 5 degree drop. So if you don't plan on cutting the panels, intake on front is preferred."
watercooling,36z08j,Scubber,1 point,Sat May 23 16:30:27 2015 UTC,"thanks for your comment. ultimately, do you think having the 240 in front allowing the extra 120 mm fan to blow unobstructed would have a noticeable impact on cooling capacity?"
watercooling,36z08j,Scubber,1 point,Sat May 23 17:37:44 2015 UTC,It's probably better than no extra cooling but from playing around with the H440's airflow I found it pretty negligible (maybe 1 or 2 extra degrees).

So after researching the answer to your question, I've come to the conclusion that the 12mm Bitspower fittings were men't for 12mm OD acrylic tube. The only PETG I've seen on McMastercar is 1/2'' which is 12.7mm which wouldn't work. So unfortunately you either go acrylic or get different fittings.  Also here is the PETG tube sizes, and [here(http://www.mcmaster.com/#standard-silicone-rubber-cords/=xavuxt) is their silicon cord selection.  Edit- seems I missed something. So it just looks like McMaster  car doesn't sell 12mm OD PETG. You'd have to get it from a retailer that sells Bitspower 12mm PETG tube."

That being said,  PETG does have a higher impact strength ( I'm sure you seen all the hammers smashing tubing on youtube ) but I can't think of a single reason why anyone would smash their watercooling loop with a hammer.

watercooling,36yp4a,willdenham,2,Sun May 24 01:08:54 2015 UTC,"I'm just gonna use the Bitspower tubing, not worth all the hassle."
watercooling,36yp4a,bawse1,1 point,Sun May 24 01:21:30 2015 UTC,"If by not stronger you're referring to the tensile strength of PETG vs Acrylic, you are correct. But in your little analogy about not mistreating acrylic goes both ways: Why would you put PETG under that high of stress unless you simply didn't measure it properly?   Secondly, once put under that stress PETG simply bends some instead of breaking, this can be seen as a positive for users (not necessarily the OP) that have not worked with rigid tubing before.  We could bring up the fact that acrylic when put under higher localized stress (say a bend where you were off by a few mills and had to force it in the fittings) over time will develop crazing, but this can be prevented if you measure it right the first time.  PETG is not UV stable as you mentioned, but who really has a massive amount of UV hitting the inside of their case? Sitting right in front of a window? Running UV lights inside all the time? Those are certainly things to think about, but under normal circumstances it wouldn't lead to much if any trouble at all.  Lastly, because Acrylic can be brittle in the right circumstances, it doesn't cut as cleanly as PETG. Obviously cutting and bending are things you only do when setting it up, but that's really the interaction the user is going to remember."

watercooling,36y61r,Helium-Isotope,1 point,Mon Jun 1 19:31:33 2015 UTC,"Alright I see this is a week or so out but you didn't get too much information.  First off the guide found in the sidebar here is really a great place to start to just learn how things work. Link here for you It really is a great place to start.  Brands are subjective. I like EK blocks alot personally as its what I have used the most. (Besides one Bitspower block that was the wrong one, which is partially my fault, oups. Still a nice block though)  Compatibility is not really an issue, as long as you do not mix metals as much as possible. (IE don't have copper and aluminium blocks/rads in the same loop)  Most fittings (the thingies that hold the tubes, sorry if I go basic , I do not know how much you know or remember) fit a G1/4 hole, so as long as you do not get something super strange you are fine.  The other thing that may be confusing is choosing a tube size, this is sortof subjective, its alot up to personal preference. Whether you want it a little bit thicker or thinner. Though I recommend the Tygon tubing, its been a real treat to work with. And it comes in different colours, if you are into that. (You could also go with rigid/hard tubing but that may be ambitious and take more time, but it does look damn sexy)  Apart from that you can choose between barb fittings which hold the tubing on via a zip tie style clamp (or you can also get fancier ones) and Compression fittings. With these you unscrew part of it, put the tube on it and then screw down, which holds the tube in place instead of a clamp. Personally I like compression fittings, but they are generally more expensive (though I think I linked particularly expensive barb fittings)  I have a DDC pump, but alot of people swear by the D5 pumps as they push more water.  If you have any specific questions I can try to answer as best I can, just ask away and Ill be candid if I do not know. I am still fairly new into it but I have done a good amount of research before my first build."

watercooling,36vyai,specikk,2,Fri May 22 15:36:03 2015 UTC,"I've had to do this a number of times now in order to get neat fan cabling.  It's all fairly simple but not so straightforward to explain without pictures.  I'd provide some but I'm on mobile atm and I don't trust the copy/paste action on this thing.  First up, definitely solder the wires if you can.  The contact will be much stronger and thus less prone to failure.  Sleeving the cables themselves can sometimes be fairly forceful on any joints, so soldering is pretty much a necessity.  Yup that sounds about right.  I usually just clip the tacho wires near to the fan hubs, again it keeps things neat.  You can tape the ends if you want but for those wires in particular it won't matter at all.  To be honest, I don't even bother with a pin removal tool/set.  Used them all, hate them all.  For removing pins I use a sewing pin, you insert it into the top side of the fan connector to push down the little flap on the pin (much like with normal ATX pins on their sides).  It's a very quick process I've found.  Other than that though, some snips, a soldering iron/station, a pair of helping hands tweezers (not essential but very very useful for soldering the wires), heatshrink (great for insulating up soldered joints) and heat source, a craft knife/wire strippers are about it.  The actual name of the connector escapes me, although they're fairly easy to find under fan connector pins.  You can use a crimper to fit them onto the ends of the wires.  I always forget to order them, so I often end up recycling the old ones by soldering new wire between them and the fan hubs.  If you want to reuse them, that's likely the simplest way as you can't recrimp them.  Personally I'd grab some new ones and crimp them yourself, gives you more flexibility that way."
watercooling,36vyai,Makirole,1 point,Fri May 22 23:30:31 2015 UTC,Thanks very much for the detailed response. Super helpful. One question I forgot to ask... What gauge/type of wire do you normally use for fans?

Not having the fluid enter the res below the stored fluid adds air back into your loop. This will lower temps and increase noise.

Also, this case still uses rivets, so I cannot replace the divider.   The 290x lightning was bought on impulse after I found one for cheap. The original plan was to get another reference 290x for the 290x I had but I found a Lightning for a cheap price and went with that.  Thanks for the honest comments  :D"
watercooling,36rbba,KlockworkEU,1 point,Fri May 22 02:11:16 2015 UTC,"You can replace rivets pretty easily with a drill, rivet gun, and a steady hand. A manual rivet gun is pretty cheap too."

watercooling,36r0rb,freewibblebon,3,Thu May 21 19:09:47 2015 UTC,We had exactly this case a few weeks back. It's a typical phenomenon with Bitspower fittings when facing acidic solutions.  Did you rinse with vinegar? Toss the fittings and check the pH-level.  Link of the last post about this: http://www.reddit.com/r/watercooling/comments/32gvk2/red_deposits_inside_loop_any_ideas/
watercooling,36r0rb,freewibblebon,1 point,Thu May 21 19:54:38 2015 UTC,No. I only used distilled water to rinse the parts.  Do you happen to know what the pH should be?  Will I need to replace all of the affected fittings? Or would just cleaning them work ?
watercooling,36r0rb,niceandcreamy,1 point,Thu May 21 20:29:04 2015 UTC,"I would toss all affected parts. Take a look at this thread to see how the parts might look if the problem continues: http://www.overclock.net/t/1417512/bitspower-fittings-and-water-temp-sensor-corrode-corrosion-after-i-used-a-bit-of-vinegar-for-36hrs-in-the-loop-with-copper-sulphate-and-copper-silver I wouldn't want all that corrosion and gunk in my system. Also the user reports that he can't clean all the stuff of (take a look at the completely broken up temp sensor).  I guess the pH level should be somewhere near pH neutral. Any acidic will draw copper and zink from your blocks, radiators, fittings, ... Bitspower fittings are known to break down under such conditions. Probably due to the Metals used for plating.  Other companies had problems with their plating too. But Bitspower is the only company that tends to ignore the users and continue the current plating process. (I have nothing against the company but as you may find users with this type of problem also report that Bitspower never answered their request.)  Edit: Does your cooling fluid have a light blueish tone? If yes, your water is acidic and turned blue due absorbed copper."
watercooling,36r0rb,niceandcreamy,1 point,Fri May 22 09:22:19 2015 UTC,Yes the water had a very faint blueish color to it.  The parts in that link look way worse than what I had. I was able to wipe off the reddish color stuff with my finger.  I ended up taking everything apart and cleaning it all with distilled water.  We'll see what ends up happening.

watercooling,36p2bo,xSerebii,1 point,Thu May 21 05:48:07 2015 UTC,"Oh, I figured sucking in cooler air from outside over the radiator would be better?  And I keep reading about having positive pressure in the case to avoid getting too much dust.  But I dunno, I'm new. :)"
watercooling,36p2bo,MadHatter5045,1 point,Thu May 21 08:24:04 2015 UTC,"You actually did it right. We discussed it at length on OCN a long time ago. The gist of it was that warm air from the radiators still escapes quickly through open vents and the rear exhaust with no noticeable impact because all components that matter are already being actively cooled. If you flip some of the fans you probably won't notice any difference in performance, but whether or not you have positive air pressure in your case becomes more of a gray area."
watercooling,36p2bo,herodrink,1 point,Thu May 21 13:03:29 2015 UTC,You already have 3 fans blowing in the front. And this panel has dust filter and the top panel does not! So you will get some dust inside. I think the optimal solution would be; all front fans blowing in and top and rear fans blowing out. That would create great airflow and performance.
watercooling,36p2bo,herodrink,1 point,Thu May 21 09:33:09 2015 UTC,Nice build! Allways love 240/540's! But why are all rad fans intake with only 1 140 as exhaust?
watercooling,36p2bo,herodrink,2,Thu May 21 06:49:16 2015 UTC,I dunno.  The case is so holey maybe it doesn't have a problem pushing air out?  Temps never get that high while playing games so I figure i'll just leave it for now.  Work in progress I suppose.

I think bottom mounted rad would be better since I'd get to keep that intake fan, and my hdd bays.  I've managed to squeeze my res/pump combo in the back, once I managed to loosen the ring that let me rotate the res so the holes are facing inwards.  I'll need to replace the ring securing the pump with this one http://www.performance-pcs.com/pump-accessories/new-xspc-d5-aluminum-screw-ring-black.html in order for it to fit, but it should work.

I tore myself case completely down (http://i.imgur.com/6V6UeTF.jpg)  Removed the side panel and cages to see what I could do.  I have a 3D printer, which I could use to probably print some kind of bracket, but I haven't used it in a long time so I'd have to calibrate everything and set everything up from scratch, which would take a toll on my back (back is completely destroyed).

watercooling,36slgu,Kautkto,1 point,Thu May 21 23:28:04 2015 UTC,"No, I have the mount, the problem is that my video cards are too long, and the res too wide, so won't fit at the mount location.    I'd have to completely remove the rear fan, but it's narrow enough to JUST fit there, but can't go low enough to line up with the mounting plate.  Basically, the pump is in the way.  That mounting area is meant for reservoir's alone I think.  Also, there's no room for the tubing if mounted there.  I've gone with rigid tubing btw."

watercooling,36moq7,Wolff_Laarcen,2,Wed May 20 15:24:17 2015 UTC,"The entire point of a rad is to bring coolant temperature down by circulating air, so you definitely don't want to use the already warm air inside the case for that - it would be better to use cool(er) ambient air from outside the case.  The ambient air coming through an intake rad is still cooler than the hot air coming directly off the internal components.  As an added bonus, that same air from outside the case will continue to circulate inside the case and displace warmer air.  Also, positive pressure creates natural exhaust.  It's not even always necessary to use fans in exhaust as long as your case has open exhaust vents and plenty of intake."
watercooling,36moq7,DarthBories,1 point,Wed May 20 17:05:45 2015 UTC,"How does the air from outside the case displace the warmer air inside the case if it has passed through a radiator? Wouldn't this result in warmer air inside a case because it passed through the radiator?  Most of the heat is sent to the radiators, so it would just be blowing the heat from the components back into the case which seems silly to me."
watercooling,36moq7,Wolff_Laarcen,1 point,Wed May 20 17:30:39 2015 UTC,"How does the air from outside the case displace the warmer air inside the case if it has passed through a radiator?    In my system at least, there is a several degree difference between ambient and case temp (right now ambient is 19C and case is 25C.  Coolant is 21C).  Ambient air blown into the case - even through a radiator - will always be at least a few degrees cooler than the case temp;  It doesnt immediately become the same temperature.  Given a choice between circulating 19C air or 25C air through my rads, I'll always take the colder air.  With 3 rads as intake (2x 360 and 1x 240 p/p in my system), the open vents in the case work as exhaust without any fans."
watercooling,36moq7,DarthBories,1 point,Wed May 20 22:42:53 2015 UTC,To each their own I guess!
watercooling,36moq7,DarthBories,1 point,Wed May 20 23:01:02 2015 UTC,The problem with that much intake is that you will get high internal pressure and the fan will lose some efficiency. Except if your case has a ton of exhaust hole for the air to go out.
watercooling,36moq7,DarthBories,2,Thu May 21 13:39:24 2015 UTC,I have a build in the enthoo pro and I kept the 200mm intake fan in the front and have a 360mm rad exhausting on the top and a 140mm rad exhausting in the back.  This isn't ideal for air pressure but it assures that the motherboard and radiators are fed cold air and not air that has already passed through a radiator.  I find it kind of silly to have radiators as intakes as it just raises the ambient tempt inside the case.  And I even tried putting the 140mm rad in the front as an intake and it resulted in a 4c increase in my cpu and gpu temps.
watercooling,36moq7,TheWatchmaker74,1 point,Wed May 20 17:28:24 2015 UTC,The problem with that setting is that i have the res on the back as well as a 420 mm rad on top so I cant fit a single 140mm rad on the back. And if i get a 240 mm rad fort the front ill have no choice but to have at least one of them as intake.
watercooling,36moq7,TheWatchmaker74,1 point,Wed May 20 17:35:09 2015 UTC,"Yes that makes sense, you would wanthte front as intake because it has filters.  You can also mount the res to the back or to the hard drive cage, the pro comes with a res bracket that can be screwed in to the left side of the hard drive cages."
watercooling,36moq7,Pbart5195,2,Wed May 20 18:04:02 2015 UTC,"If you can avoid letting your rads intake into your case, do it. I have a 480 rad in taking into my 900d and the air gets quite hot in my case under load.   That rad cools my twin 780ti sli. I'm going to put a piece of acrylic over the top to prevent the hot air from rising, now I know why people do it, I thought it was just for looks.   That rad is on the bottom side.   Edit: if you aren't going crazy on the OC, you might be able to run everything through your top rad."
watercooling,36moq7,DarthBories,2,Wed May 20 14:54:54 2015 UTC,"Yeah I have a decent overclock, my 780ti is at around 1275 MHz. I checked yesterday and the exaust temp was around 38 degre on my 420 rad.   One of the thing I was considering was to use the bigger (420 rad on top) as an input and the smaller one (240mm in the front) as the output. I also put the 140 mm back fan as an out put, that way I would have positive air pressure. Would  that work well?"
watercooling,36moq7,Pbart5195,1 point,Wed May 20 15:16:00 2015 UTC,"This build is only my second, pushing my very limited knowledge!  I would keep the front as intake and top exhaust. That's a big rad on top to be dumping lots of hot air.   But, if everthing is water cooled, I guess internal case temp is not such a big problem, as long as your drives have cool air going over them.   Edit: don't forget you can try one setup, then flip the fans to try another direction. It's a bit of fiddling but worth a shot."
watercooling,36moq7,DarthBories,2,Wed May 20 15:45:46 2015 UTC,yeah you're right about that ill try different setup and see which one gives me the best temp and ill watch the internal temp of the case too.
watercooling,36moq7,auApex,1 point,Wed May 20 16:17:38 2015 UTC,"WC'd Enthoo Pro owner here. I use a 420mm rad on top as exhaust on a 4690k and an R9 290x. 120 rear intake, 2x140 front intake, and 140 bottom intake. GPU temps are under 50 at load and CPU is under 70 at load with very low fan speeds.  I have considered adding a 240mm rad to the front of the case. If I were to set it up I would definitely use it as intake.  Water temp equalizes over time in a loop. Given your rear intake will provide some fresh air to the 420, and the air crossing the 240 will never be higher than your water temp, you will still be able to use that air to cool the 420.  More rad space = more cooling potential. Which means higher overclocks or lower fan speeds. Whatever is more important to you."

watercooling,36i02c,SharkSpider,1 point,Wed May 20 10:29:37 2015 UTC,Because you're using the top port of the reservoir as an inlet?  Does the coolant not make noise when it goes back into the res?  It should be falling onto the coolant in the reservoir without a downpipe.
watercooling,36i02c,nono0044,1 point,Wed May 20 14:03:50 2015 UTC,"Not necessarily. If it's a continuous stream of water coming straight down out of a tube it won't make noise, since the overall ""shape"" of the water's surface stays the same. I noticed something similar when I was filling my loop (which has a down pipe) and it was silent even though the res level was well below where the tube ended."

Xspc kit is fine, but you'll need to get a block for your 290x (if there is a block for it).  The radiator may be a bit small for the amount of heat to dissipate.  You'll also be getting barb fittings, if you're okay with using those.  Also bay res/pumps have been said to cause noise due to the un-isolated vibrations that it creates.

watercooling,36krt0,turbo_customs,2,Thu May 21 02:01:00 2015 UTC,"Fair enough.  The great thing about custom cooling is you can upgrade whenever you feel like it. And if you have a part you like you can use it on your next build, or just keep upgrading the same case a piece at a time, that's how I ended up with mine, it was a pretty basic build with stock everything when I started. Unfortunately GPU blocks are usually only for a specific card."
watercooling,36krt0,nono0044,1 point,Thu May 21 02:46:59 2015 UTC,"+1 on the xspc res - all the feedback I have seen on this product suggests that you should steer clear as the failure rate is very high. If I was in your position I would consider going with a kit like this one from EK - https://www.ekwb.com/shop/kits-cases/kits/ek-kit-l360-r2-0.html however that only covers your CPU, you would still need to buy a block for your GPU. The unfortunate reality is that $300 will barely cover the above kit I suggested.  BUT, in terms of a starting point, with an upgrade path to adding a gpu waterblock down the line, you cannot really get any better in terms of value and quality.  The 360 rad will be enough for both cpu and gpu, so all you will need to do is buy a gpu waterblock, tubing and a couple of fittings in the future, to add graphics watercooling."
watercooling,36krt0,nono0044,1 point,Wed May 20 04:50:23 2015 UTC,"as much as I would love to get a 360 rad, my case will not support it unless I do some pretty serious modifications. I'll look more into going the ek route, but I may end up mixing and matching. Might try to go xspc cpu/gpu block, ek/thermaltake pump/res.

watercooling,36krt0,Kautkto,1 point,Wed May 20 05:09:21 2015 UTC,"I've seen the Pacific res used all over, but only the combo with the D5 pump which is obviously way more expensive.  I can't comment on the quality of the pump in the version you linked, but the res itself is relatively popular."

Back to the drawing board"
watercooling,36krt0,unhappyemo,1 point,Thu May 21 02:06:07 2015 UTC,"A) Not a lot of reliable data and information about it.  On thermaltake's site they claim similar performance to a DDC pump.  The thermaltake reservoir and pump is cheaper than just a standalone DDC, would you trust the performance specs based on that info alone?  In addition a post from 2009, doesn't really strike any more confidence.  Also the res isn't designed well.  On the off chance that it does move water well, the lack of an anti-cyclone device can cause problems.   Mediocre pump that runs too hot, and doesn't push too much fluid.  Much better options available today.  B) Thermaltake. Yuck.  This is a company that is still pushing aluminium rads onto the market like its hot shit.  I had some green premixed coolant from them that turned brown in 3 months.  As for the barbs.  If you set them up right, they run perfectly well.  You are correct about the looks thing, hence why I said go with them if you were okay with them.  You should put more effort into researching.  There's lots of information out there available that helps you determine if parts are good or not, and the rationale behind why they are good/bad."

watercooling,36l7a5,stup1d_nerd,1 point,Wed May 20 05:08:29 2015 UTC,"Yes, the standard is G1/4 threaded fittings. There will be a female threaded hole on your waterblock, pump top, res, etc for that type of fitting. Check to make sure if you're using some weird component.  If you want to put a connection in the middle of a piece of tubing, you need a female-female threaded connection, or a three-way or y-way splitter... But if you don't have a good reason for it, it's probably best to avoid it. Every additional connection is another potential point for a leak.  Be aware, the fitting you linked is for 'Hard' tubing, not standard soft tubing. It won't work with anything but hard acrylic (or steel, copper, etc) tubing."

Techflex is the biggest company out there, but there are some no-name alternatives floating around ebay and the rest of the internet.  Your original picture with the navy blue looks like techflex's weave. Their Flexo PET comes in about 40 different colors/designs.   The key to sleeving is remember that most sleeving can get bigger (Flexo PET can expand up to around 150% of its normal size) but it doesn't get smaller. That means you want to order the same OD as your tubing, or order a single size smaller to make it a little more snug.  The only other thing tricky is getting fittings on it. Pull the sleeving over the whole tube first, and on one end slightly pull it so it extends over the end of the tubing so you can slide your compression fitting over the sleeving first and then over the covered tubing.   EDIT: Oh! Almost forgot. Be sure to pick a color tubing that blends or is rather inconspicuous with the sleeving. If you want dark sleeving, buy black tubing. If you want lighter colors, you're probably going to go with white or clear. If your sleeving size is too small for the OD of the tubing, some tubing will show through the weave."
watercooling,36inlg,willdenham,1 point,Tue May 19 18:33:11 2015 UTC,"Wow this is the comment I needed, thanks!  I think I may sleeve my current build now, I'll probably get black tubing first though so the red sleeving looks better.  So you use commonly use this sleeving and haven't come across any problems besides maybe the compression fittings being a little harder to tighten, the sleeving doesn't bunch up on tight turns or anything?  I wish I could see more builds that did this, seems very easy but isn't common at all."
watercooling,36inlg,willdenham,2,Tue May 19 18:43:03 2015 UTC,"Decided to take a couple of quick photos as I had some laying around:  Here's what it comes like from WireCare.com (other sites sell it, I just use wirecare personally since they ship out quick and offer by the foot pricing)  This is 5/8"" sleeving stretched over 3/4"" OD tubing."
watercooling,36inlg,turbo_customs,1 point,Tue May 19 19:03:36 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the advice and photos, it really helps.  Good to know about use a lighter on the ends so they don't fray.  And for some reason I didn't think it would ship flat like that, makes sense though.  Black tubing with red sleeving would probably look good if your pic with white sleeving is any indication, I like being able to see the tubing underneath.   Thanks again for all the information, exactly what I needed!   I'll be sure to tag you when I finally get around to sleeving my tubing, might be a while though :)"

If it would be an issue caused by overheating the pc would shutdown, not restart. However 65C with watercooling on a stock CPU is a bit high. On that note, it could be insufficient flow (Which I don't think it is, the pump is a good one. Depends on the distance and complexity of your loop), a too small radiator etc etc.  I only have theoretical knowledge atm so correct me if I'm wrong reddit."

I definitely have enough radiators.  Here is a picture of my loop. As you can see, tube 2 feeds into the CPU block. I'm thinking that run might be a tad too long, plus the uphill push of it might be giving me the bad CPU temps. I'll probably do some fixing on that."

Depending on the specs of the 390X, you might only need one to do what you're asking for. 3440x1440 is about 60% of 4K, so if the 390X is anywhere close to the 295x2, one will be plenty.  Also, for $5k, you might as well go for X99 and its marginal advantages."

Cheaper motherboard, jesus. $550 is ridiculous, even for X99.  Motherboard blocks are kinda useless, but that's up to you."
watercooling,36ej1e,Spekl,2,Mon May 18 22:29:24 2015 UTC,"In regards to the 5960X, I have always seen it the opposite to you. The 5820K brings 6 core, X99, etc and the 5960X has that monstrous 8core 16 thread thing going on, but the only advantage of getting a 5930K over a 5820K is a couple of PCIe lanes, and maybe higher binning."
watercooling,36ej1e,Techonup,2,Tue May 19 00:09:04 2015 UTC,"The main advantage that I see in the 5930K is the extra PCIe lanes, lets you Crossfire/SLI at x16/x16 instead of x8/x8 (not that it especially matters). In a typical situation I'd probably recommend the 5820K too, but OP just has boatloads of money for whatever reason."
watercooling,36ej1e,godzirrasti,2,Tue May 19 00:13:15 2015 UTC,"Higher binning would be the only reason to go with 5960X at the moment. Unless you need 8 cores. OP if you want DDR4 you could wait for skylake as it is expected to ship 2H 15. Could be worth the wait to see if PCIE4 is included in the chipset, and a 5770k would most likely be in the same price range as the 4790k."

Regardless of the CPU/motherboard combo I use, I do intend on getting DDR4, and the rest of my components are pretty set in stone as well (except possibly the SSD).

In fact it won't even fit the single 360 rad you have listed, which is woefully inadequate for two high-end GPUs, a CPU, and motherboard blocks. You need at least double the rad space and I just don't see where you're going to put that unless you're doing external rads."

Any reputable radiator (Find one you like the look of, then type ""*radiator name* review"" into google.   A reservoir.  Cpu block you like the look of.

watercooling,36d850,willdenham,3,Mon May 18 15:38:49 2015 UTC,"For order: Reservoir to pump. That's all that matters. The rest can basically be any way you want it to be.   Radiator surface area should be based (roughly) around this: 120mm + 120mm per component. So with you having two GPUs, and a CPU, you need at least 360mm of radiator space to squeak by and it's recommended you have 480mm of space. This can be broken up over multiple radiators as you see fit (i.e. two 240s, a 360 and a 120, etc.).  Holes on the reservoir make it easier for tube routing. They also include another typically for filling the res. It's all just about options, really."

This not only is my first loop, but also my first time using an aftermarket cooler/overclocking. Have a better suggestion?   Triple rad is all? So I'm good with just the 360mm?   Are you suggesting I get, for example, red tubes and just use distiller water in the loop? What do I do to prevent corrosion?   I looked at kits on EK, but most were sold out, so I based this off of a lot of research and parts of those kits. I may have gone over board. But i plan to cool my GPUs, not just my CPU like all the kits have.   I picked the res/pump as being separated from reading people recommending the d5. And the Define S has a dedicated spot to hang the reservoir. I picked the 250mm res because I thought it would fill the case better. What's your opinion? Maybe go for a 150mm combo and just mount it on the pump mount at the bottom of the case?   Also, I plan to build this within the next week or two after graduation as I've been saving for a while. Should I invest in adapter fittings? And what's the best configuration to keep all my components cool while also keeping my PC insanely quiet(the one I built 3 years ago sounds like a jet plane about to take off and gets hotter than jet fuel trying to melt steel beams whenever I play any slightly resource intensive games. Subnautica starts to feel like a simulator.   Edit: Also, as far as overclocking, I really only plan on OCing the CPU to about 4.3GHz.

watercooling,36av9m,DarkStarrFOFF,1 point,Mon May 18 01:28:58 2015 UTC,"Nothing is wrong with AS5 it just isn't the top product anymore. Still very good but there are a few that are a bit better with no cure time like AS5.  As far as triple rad, if you're only overclocking the CPU a little then it should be fine. Now you mention you want it quiet, if so usually you want as much rad space as you can get. Basically the case should allow for a 360 up front and up to a 420 up top but I'm not sure it will fit both at the same time. If not then maybe 2 360mm rads. Point is, more radiators means you can have more fans at slower speeds for a quieter machine.  Basically if it were my machine, depending on how quiet I wanted it, I would go with a thick 360mm rad up front, then if I wanted super quiet at least a 240 up top. Probably a D5 since DDC's are louder IIRC. The blocks you picked are fine but if you don't care about colored coolant then get distilled water and some biocide (PT Nuke PHN) to keep it dead. Then get a solid color tubing. Up to you on that though.  Are you in the US or what? Buying direct from EK is usually pretty expensive thanks to crazy shipping."

I'm not sure if 3.3 to 4.3 is considered a little bit or not, but to me that sounds large.   I think I'll stick with a 360 and a 240 like I have selected in that case then.   I am in the U.S. Are there cheaper places I can get the necessary parts? This just seemed to be the most reputable/easy place to navigate."
watercooling,36av9m,DarkStarrFOFF,1 point,Mon May 18 02:00:20 2015 UTC,"Ok. Well, I did some comparisons and basically, if you use performance-pcs.com for the parts by only swapping the fittings, pump top and res for very similar models you can add a second radiator and 2 fans for only like $50 more than getting it all at EK.   Now I may have found something you missed, how were the GPU's going to be connected? I see you have 8 fittings, 2 for the pump, 2 for the res, 2 for the rad, and 2 for the CPU. You need at least 2 more for the GPU's since what you listed is a separate pump/res combo. Now then the GPU's also need either a D-Plug, a crystal link set, a pair of fittings (this would be pretty much impossible unless the cards are spaced apart) or an EK terminal to join them together."

The loop order doesn't really matter as long as it is flowing through the CPU block the right way (if it matters on the block you're getting). Loop order makes no real difference unless you are running multiple (think 3-4) GPU that have very high TDP's.

watercooling,36av9m,Kautkto,2,Mon May 18 01:03:28 2015 UTC,"And the pump in the h220 isn't one most people would buy. On the h240 you need to replace the outlet if OP wanted to use different fittings at all. Also you're suggesting he expand a pre-filled kit with either of the Swiftech options which is a waste. Beyond that the EK kits don't have the D5, or clear tubing, the cheaper one has a lower end water block. Also doesn't have the colored coolant OP wanted.  So yea kit parts aren't usually different but the swiftech ""kits"" obviously are not the way to go to do a full loop. The EK ones don't have quite a few of the things the OP listed in his build. He would also have to get separate GPU blocks still.  The X360 kit has an XTX rad which may be too thick, the L360 has the MX CPU block."

watercooling,36bk06,MiikePetez,6,Mon May 18 01:24:37 2015 UTC,"Water cooling won't help you at all with heat output into the room unless you run the radiators in a different room. Thermodynamics won't allow you to erase heat, it needs to move somewhere, so every watt of heat your computer outputs is still dumped into the room. Water cooling just makes it so your components don't have the majority of that heat allowing you to push them harder.  If your goal is solely heat output into the room, your only real solutions computer-wise are going liquid nitrogen (which is not recommended unless you're a professional), or to under-volt your hardware to get them to produce less heat which will likely require you to under-clock and take away performance. I'd recommend just looking into air conditioning or ghetto it with a fan on top of a bucket of ice.  If you instead want you're hardware to run cool, or get into overclocking (knowing that that will require over-volting and increased watts of heat output in most cases) then consider water cooling. If by volume you mean noise levels, one of the primary reasons people water cool is to have silent systems, if you have a fan controller and set it up to make the fans spin only when the components get hot enough, it will be literally silent as long as passive cooling is sufficient. If silence is the most important thing, thin radiators are best since they outperform thick ones at very low fan speeds"
watercooling,36bk06,Alestor,1 point,Mon May 18 02:58:12 2015 UTC,"I would say, anything what Alestor wrote is right. And i must say, that if you watercool, you transport even more heat into the air, because the transfer of the heat is better. Sometimes its not quieter if you use watercooling. For that you need lots of radiatorspace and for that you need a big tower. And Watercooling will eat a lot of Money. So it would maybe be better, if you would invest the Money into newer Hardware which generates less heat."
watercooling,36bk06,shiki87,1 point,Mon May 18 04:34:06 2015 UTC,"As others have said, watercooling just makes heat transfer from your heat-producing elements to a radiator more efficient and in general quieter since you can get bigger, better radiators rather than the ones you get with air coolers.  The way you get the heat in the room better is to move the hot air out of the room, or at least, move it elsewhere in the room. A little tower fan on your computer desk will do great to keep the air circulating (as we type, I have my office's ceiling fan going full tilt to keep this early Texas summer air moving, but I also run my AC pretty heavily during the summer because I hate my wallet and want it to suffer).   If your dorm allows it, you may want to see if you can install a window fan which can vent hot air from your room."

Check if the short is on the GPU by disconnecting the 970 from the motherboard and PSU and try run the spare GPU.

watercooling,368q2z,rtb001,2,Sun May 17 14:44:57 2015 UTC,"In my understanding of basic chemistry, adding stuff into your water coolant will do several things:   potential anti-corrosive and anti-microbial effects (possibly useful, although distilled water with a kill coil will do the same) lower the freezing temperature (why the coolant in our cars is called ""anti-freeze"") and raise the boiling temperature (useful for a hot car engine, useless for a warmish PC cooling loop) presumably decrease the specific heat of water, which would mean that theoretically the cooling performance would go DOWN   I am thinking that this coolant is got to be at least 95% water by weight, maybe even 99%?  If you're looking for absolute cooling performance, no liquid will out do pure water: list of specific heat of common liquids  The only one up there with more cooling capacity than water is ammonia, which is both corrosive AND volatile.  ...  So someone here go try to setup a sealed ammonia loop :-) Be sure to post pictures of your heavily corroded rig and chemically burned body afterwards!!!"

watercooling,368q2z,niceandcreamy,1 point,Sun May 17 08:46:03 2015 UTC,Gallium is safe to handle in your hands. Its just solid at room temperature so you would have to fill your loop in the sun and leave the PC on 24/7.

watercooling,368q2z,Kinaestheticsz,1 point,Sun May 17 11:56:34 2015 UTC,"Upsides are that it has biocides and corrosion inhibitors in it, so you aren't going to have nearly as many problems with your blocks deteriorating over time (which silver kill coils tend to do).  However, you do NOT get better temperatures over plain old distilled. Maybe near equal, but since it is based off a distilled water base, but with added stuffs in it, it will never perform better.  As for staining blocks, no. The only real color that will tend to stain blocks is red/pink. Most other colors will not stain your blocks.  Also, Ice Dragon is effectively the same thing as Mayhems line of coolants. You might be able to find Mayhems cheaper than Ice Dragon fluids."

watercooling,3686u3,Nicholas_Spawn,1 point,Sun May 17 15:06:07 2015 UTC,No real advantages. People see better temps with more radiator space while it's hard to measure the benefits of additional flow.
watercooling,3686u3,herminzerah,1 point,Sun May 17 03:15:23 2015 UTC,The benefit from 2 pumps in series is only valid if you are putting all your blocks in a  parallel configuration.  Otherwise 1 d5 would would work fine for blocks in series configuration

watercooling,365tj8,erickliban,1 point,Sat May 16 18:07:52 2015 UTC,"Mainly CPU, potentially GPU down the road. If I can add the GPU cooler later, that's a nice perk, but not a necessity.  The photon is 2.8 inches in diameter according to their site... It would definitely be a tight fit, if it does fit. That's one of the main reasons I'm considering the dual bay reservoirs instead. The tubes definitely look cooler, but functionality is more important to me, as well as minimal case modification.  I think 280mm rads can fit in the HAF XB, but I might need to do some trimming on the case to make sure air can flow through the entire area. That's going to be the largest rad that will fit without more serious modifications to the case."

watercooling,365tj8,unhappyemo,1 point,Sat May 16 20:14:57 2015 UTC,There are no waterblocks for the 660s unless they are custom or only covering the die on the gpu at least last time I checked. I only found 660ti waterblocks and I ended up getting two evga 660s 2GB before finding out about the lack of blocks.  I would say just throw two 240mm rads in there with a pump so you'll have one for the CPU and one for the GPU(s) down the road with one/two extra rad spaces just to be safe. If not you can do a 240mm and a 120mm if you don't plan on going dual GPU later.

watercooling,365x6y,IIIRogueIII,1 point,Sun May 17 17:29:36 2015 UTC,What if you used bitspower fittings instead of bending the acrylic? Or would flexible still be easier?
watercooling,365x6y,funk_monk,1 point,Sun May 17 17:54:02 2015 UTC,"That would remove 90% of the extra work required with acrylic, but you still have to carefully measure each length.

watercooling,365x6y,Alestor,1 point,Sun May 17 18:00:43 2015 UTC,Flexible is easier since its just snip and place. Hard lines require a lot of measurement and pre planning to get right even if you don't bend. Whereas with flexible you can just eyeball it  It'll be incredibly expencive to get all the fittings you would need to avoid bends that I would say just bend anyways. You're looking as hundreds of dollars on unecessary fittings when you could just get a bending kit
watercooling,365x6y,awyeahmuffins,1 point,Sun May 17 18:04:37 2015 UTC,How much positive pressure is too much?  Today I dove into watercooling by picking up a second hand build for a good price. Everything seems to be in order except I noticed that both 360mm rads (top and bottom) act as intake and there is also 2 front intake fans on the case.   The only exhaust fan is a a single 140mm fan. Would it benefit me to switch the top rad to exhaust?  Picture for reference: http://imgur.com/jaBGFbf
watercooling,365l1d,SeaJayCJ,5,Sat May 16 10:31:03 2015 UTC,"The point of the res-feeds-rad rule is to keep the pump fed with water, as the pump needs water to lubricate itself and dies quickly when run dry. It has nothing to do with temperatures - in fact, loop order is basically irrelevant when it comes to temperatures. Don't listen to anyone who says otherwise.   If you want to run res -> rad -> pump, when filling your loop you need to make sure that the water from the res has made its way through the rad and is supplying the pump with water before you switch your pump on. Depending on the way you're planning to mount things, this can range from annoying to basically impossible."
watercooling,365l1d,techno_babble_,1 point,Sat May 16 11:13:36 2015 UTC,It would also cause issues as bubbles are gradually released from the radiator into the pump. Not a good idea at all.
watercooling,365l1d,SeaJayCJ,2,Sat May 16 11:33:42 2015 UTC,I've decided to go against this idea all-together now because I'll put the ports of the radiator at the bottom and have a drain valve connected there for easier drainage. I'll now go res -> pump -> rad -> gpu -> rad -> cpu -> res and there won't be any crossed tubes. now looking at coloured fluid!

watercooling,363vtx,ACynicalLamp,1 point,Fri May 15 22:06:29 2015 UTC,"Radiators are fairly easy to size. You need at least 120mm of surface area per component you're cooling. If you're doing a CPU and two GPUs, you need at least 360mm of radiator space. It is advised you go 120mm beyond that, so for this set up at least 420mm of radiator space.   I'd at least get another 120mm in addition to the 360 just to keep temps down a little more."
watercooling,363vtx,willdenham,1 point,Sat May 16 00:08:38 2015 UTC,"What if I do a push-pull type of setup with six fans?  I just recall reading about it, but not delving too deeply, iirc it's better right?  Also aside from the radiator, everything else looking good?"
watercooling,363vtx,Karavusk,1 point,Sat May 16 00:42:12 2015 UTC,"always try to get the max rad space possible, its not that expensive.  I like a d5 vario pump more than a ddc pump and I would stick with mayhems dye. Everything else looks fine."
watercooling,363vtx,nono0044,1 point,Sat May 16 01:43:34 2015 UTC,"I just remember reading something like the DDCs were more common and practically an idiot proof design.  I'll check out the dye, any particular reason for the suggestion?  Also can it be used with a non-conductive clear fluid?"
watercooling,363vtx,tedlasman,1 point,Sat May 16 02:14:53 2015 UTC,"DDCs are smaller and more practical due to the face that they take up less size.  They deliver more head pressure to push through more restrictive loops (which shouldnt be a problem for a D5 either).   But they run hotter and can be louder due to vibrations.  Not really sure why he suggested mayhems, not like you were going for the pastel look.  If the primochill stuff works for you, then just stick with that."
watercooling,363vtx,nono0044,1 point,Sat May 16 03:38:30 2015 UTC,Mayhems also makes dyes that don't have the pastel look...
watercooling,363vtx,tedlasman,1 point,Sat May 16 04:38:27 2015 UTC,"But whats the point of buying a clear premixed (or distilled with killcoil+nuke) and buying dye, when a predyed solution costs the same or less?"
watercooling,363vtx,nono0044,1 point,Sat May 16 04:49:12 2015 UTC,"Just copper sulfate is enough, you don't need the coil. You get a LOT more fluid by mixing yourself. and you have control over the color, etc. The fluid he picked out looks nice though."
watercooling,363vtx,willdenham,2,Sat May 16 04:58:53 2015 UTC,"You could do all that. Or OP can simply stick to what hes chosen because its easier for him and its what he wants.

watercooling,3634ec,nono0044,1 point,Fri May 15 19:18:08 2015 UTC,"Everything looks okay so far.  Since you want rigid, you can go with EK, Bitspower, or Primochill.  If you go with primochill, you need to use primochill fittings.  If you don't want to bend tubing, BP has the best selection of angle adapters for hard tubing.  Depending how crazy you want to go with your tubing runs, I found that a pack of 4x24"" of primochill tubing to be enough with my system (2 rads, 2 cards), even after some practice bends.  As for a pump most people will suggest any of the DDC pumps if you have a space constraint, or any D5 pump if you have the space (and the money).  D5 pumps, while bigger, vibrates less and runs less hot that the DDC.  If I remember correctly, the DDCs have more head pressure, while the D5s have higher flow.  But for both, since you're going with hard tubing, you'll need an aftermarket pump top."

Aqua Computer do a really sexy one that can be mounted onto a faceplate, and then Koolance do a whole bunch of different inline filters.  I personally don't use one, but I am definitely considering the AQ filter for my next build."
watercooling,3639nj,turbo_customs,1 point,Sat May 16 17:53:07 2015 UTC,"If you had the AQ filter, would you have to do maintenance less frequently? I'm struggling to see the point of something like this."
watercooling,3639nj,BeringI,1 point,Sun May 17 16:38:05 2015 UTC,"Not necessarily.  It's simply a safeguard so that if any large particles do contaminate the loop, they should be caught in the filter.  You don't see many people using them, to be honest."
watercooling,3639nj,turbo_customs,1 point,Mon May 18 15:27:36 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure you just need to keep cleaning it out again and again until it is all clean.

watercooling,363out,willdenham,1 point,Sat May 16 20:56:22 2015 UTC,I was thinking the same.  I imagine it could be quite fiddly but what a unique look.  I spent quite some time on prismatic powders before giving KC the go ahead.  So many possibilities!

watercooling,363rac,cooperred,1 point,Tue May 26 08:05:16 2015 UTC,Oh. Didn't expect a response this long after I posted this. My biggest worry is pump and res placement. As of now I am looking at a time res about 240mm in length and one of the D5 variations on the marker. The best way I could see this working is to get the pump mounted on the back of the case by the tubing holes and the pump on top of the hard drive cage resting plate on the bottom of the case. Do you think this would work well?
watercooling,363rac,cooperred,1 point,Tue May 26 11:55:23 2015 UTC,Whoops sorry. What rads are you using and where?
watercooling,363rac,cooperred,1 point,Tue May 26 15:33:14 2015 UTC,I'm still planning. I gotta raise the money. I was thinking about using an Alphacool XT45 240 and 360 rad on the top and the front. And maybe one on the back? Not sure entirely yet on that back one.
watercooling,363rac,cooperred,1 point,Tue May 26 15:37:31 2015 UTC,"If you have a rad in the front, you're going to have to take off the bottom plate. I'm not too sure a 45mm rad can fit in the top either, but it could.   I wouldn't have one on the back, it makes tubing runs a lot messier.  If you take the plate off though, you could get a 120mm fan adapter and use that on the bottom fan mounts and mount the pump to that."

watercooling,3620ek,andyha1010,1 point,Fri May 15 12:54:23 2015 UTC,"I have the CM Glacer V2 and have had no problems in the month and a half I have had it.  The pump is incredibly powerful and I would recommend lowering the power that is delivered to it either through an application or your motherboard's settings if possible because it is too powerful to be used with just the radiator and no reservoir.  Performance wise, I have a Pentium G3258 oc'ed to 4.5 GHz w/ 1.38 volts and it runs idle at 33 degrees, gaming 55 degrees, and when stress tested goes up to a max of 64.  Also you can always add a res, rad, and other water blocks to the Glacer which is something no other AIO offers (in America anyway).  But if you really want to have fun putting stuff together buying parts is the way to go; with the Glacer you just screw the rad into your case and attach the water block/pump to the motherboard."

watercooling,3613hc,libertine88,1 point,Fri May 15 05:17:15 2015 UTC,very nice!  im in the process of planning out an almost all ek loop myself. could you do me a huge favour? could you measure the distance from the pump/res (from the front where the inlet/outlet ports are) back to the fan its mounted on (including the added length of the pump holder?  im planning on doing the same thing in a h440 and want to work out what size rad i can fit in the front with the pump/res + ek uni pump holder+ fan.
watercooling,3613hc,libertine88,1 point,Sat May 16 23:05:33 2015 UTC,Yeah np. Its 12cm from the case chassis the adapter is mounted on to the end of the inlet extension.   Assuming you want the best spacing and go with 90 degree fittings they're another 3cm with the ACF fitting on it. So I'd make sure you had at least 16cm clearance on top of the rad for it so that you could get in there to turn the compression fitting
watercooling,3615ep,awyeahmuffins,1 point,Fri May 15 05:39:59 2015 UTC,"The biggest question is the price. Also, what tubing was used, what fittings are used, what the coolant consists of and if it has a kill coil (In which case is there any nickel in the loop?) or if it has additives like biocides and anti corrosives.."

watercooling,3615ep,SharkSpider,1 point,Fri May 15 12:27:07 2015 UTC,"Yeah I figured that was a decent price for the build parts alone considering their quality, but the loop on top of that is what made it a very good deal.

watercooling,360zk9,willdenham,1 point,Fri May 15 09:59:21 2015 UTC,And if it doesn't doesn't display anything you can use a motherboard speaker to get a an error code which you can look up in your motherboard's manual.
watercooling,360zk9,Sartanen,1 point,Fri May 15 11:15:46 2015 UTC,"It's an EVGA with a temp monitor that also gives the boot status. As I can recall it would go through post and then display the temp until it restarted. I might be wrong on that though, I'll have to check again when I'm home from work.  And yeah, made sure that both the plugs were firmly plugged in. Is doing a CMOS reset just pressing the reset button on the mobo? Did that it that's that case...  Really hoping I didn't damage my processor or anything when I was installing my new tubing or something"
watercooling,360zk9,willdenham,2,Fri May 15 12:05:35 2015 UTC,"Clearing the CMOS normally involves swapping a jumper to the Reset position and power cycling the machine, or removing power from the PSU and removing the CMOS battery (the watch-like battery on the motherboard itself). This reverts the motherboard to its default settings.  That boot status is crucial though if it has that listed. Find out what code it lists as it is booting up, and if it looks like it boots into windows properly try swapping your GPU into a different PCI-E slot or try another GPU to test."

Try to boot with the one stick. If that stick doesn't work, swap it for another and give it a shot.  When all else fails, remember the first step to troubleshooting boot problems: Break the system down to bare essentials. Take out the GPU (if possible), disconnect any other PCI devices, unplug any SATA connectors from the motherboard, and as little RAM as you can. This will tell you if it boots. Once it boots, add your components back on one by one to find out what is causing the issue."

watercooling,360op4,nono0044,1 point,Fri May 15 02:44:22 2015 UTC,"Well the tool is an EK thing, so of course they don't list the compatibility of other brands.  If you aren't looking to get an EK block, the tool is to check if your card is reference or not or to get a rough idea of what kind of blocks will fit.  Is your card the double dissipation model?  Because Alphacool lists it as one of the compatible cards with that block-thing.  Unless you are 100% sure the PCB is the same, I wouldn't want to risk buying something that won't fit and needs to be returned.  Also, the Alphacool block is simply a gpu chip only block that also has a heatsink for the vrm and other parts of the card.  Just an FYI."
watercooling,360hge,Munimalist,1 point,Fri May 15 01:34:28 2015 UTC,"Well since you chose to go with primochill's hard tubing, you're kind of stuck using their fittings (which isn't a bad thing, they're quite good).

watercooling,360hge,nono0044,1 point,Fri May 15 02:09:54 2015 UTC,Its not that bad really.  Their fittings work well and they offer a pretty good variety of colours and an okay selection of styles.  Yup everything else is g1/4 standard so other adaptors and rotaries will work.

watercooling,35zb0m,Monroeshindelar,2,Thu May 14 19:45:55 2015 UTC,"The cause is probably one of the following two. You're still bleeding out air from your loop, usually from places like the top of your radiators where air gets trapped and it's hard to escape and it's just slowly moving from from your radiator to your reservoir. In that case, just wait and keep topping it up until it stops.   The second case is that you do have a leak somewhere, only it's so small that the water doesn't accrue enough to form a droplet before evaporating. Finding leaks like these can be really time-consuming if you don't have a way to pressure test your system such as with an air compressor. You can try to tighten everything as best you can, which won't guarantee fixing anything as I've found some of these small leak points are often on rotary fittings or on points with large diameter gaskets that you wouldn't normally suspect. The best thing to do in absense of doing a pressure test is performing a full tear down and smearing all your joints and threads with plumber's grease to make sure you have good seals."
watercooling,35zb0m,Wincrest,1 point,Thu May 14 20:02:14 2015 UTC,I feel like the res lowered enough from this morning to now that the leak would be prevalent.
watercooling,35zb0m,nono0044,1 point,Thu May 14 20:13:45 2015 UTC,"Did you bleed the loop properly?  Could be some trapped air escaping.  Is your reservoir closed properly? If not, it could be evaporating."
watercooling,35zb0m,nono0044,1 point,Thu May 14 19:55:38 2015 UTC,I'm fairly certain its closed properly. What is the correct procedure for bleeding?
watercooling,35zb0m,nono0044,1 point,Thu May 14 20:20:11 2015 UTC,"Well you sort of built yourself into a corner since based off your other comment you used the fill/bleed port for an inlet.   Usually you'd open the fill/bleed port and tilt the case around to get the air trapped in block, rads, and tubing to move back into the reservoir to escape from your loop.  Not sure how you're gonna do that now the way you've set things up."
watercooling,35zb0m,nono0044,1 point,Fri May 15 02:06:44 2015 UTC,Well don't I feel silly
watercooling,35zb0m,nono0044,1 point,Fri May 15 02:24:28 2015 UTC,How did you fill the loop?  Does the lid of your reservoir have more than one port?
watercooling,35zb0m,UF8FF,1 point,Fri May 15 02:30:37 2015 UTC,"No. I unscrewed the top fitting that held the pipe in place, unscrewed the top of the res, put the fitting back together so that it doesn't fall off while I'm filling it and get water everywhere, put a tube in it attached it to a funnel, filler her up and then unscrewed the fitting again, screwed the top back on the rest, and rescrewed the fitting  All while being extremely careful"
watercooling,35zb0m,UF8FF,1 point,Fri May 15 02:56:07 2015 UTC,Yeah you probably have lots of trapped air in your loop since it didn't really seem like you were able to bleed it while you filled it.  Best thing to do now is to let it run and fill it up when and if the bubbles ever make it back to your res.

(it isn't specified anywhere on the one i'm looking at). same thing for the gpu block. how do i install quick disconnect couplings? i want to be able to swap out my GPU whenever i please, so this would be perfect. but how do you put it in? there's a female and male type, so does that mean i need one of each to make it work? do i connect them together and then attach the whole assembly to my water block twice (one assembly for the inlet and the other for the outlet) or does the female go in one of the holes and the male go in the other? and also, how does the tubing fit in the coupling? it doesn't look like it has any form of fitting to hold it in and none of them specify an inner/outer diameter like fittings do. is one big (360mm) radiator enough? or should i accompany that with a smaller one as well? and should the radiator be at the beginning of my loop, or the end? how much fluid do i need? my radiator holds 690mL and the bottle i wanna buy has 1L. is this enough? is the 310mL enough fluid to fill all the tubing and water blocks?   sorry for all the questions, but hopefully you guys can help me out a lot. it seems that despite all the guides out there, i'm still super lost."
watercooling,35xzsa,RimStain,2,Thu May 14 22:15:25 2015 UTC,"I don't know of any bad brands, all the major brands are good its just a matter of price/style. Also Barrow are cheap and effective I hear   2.Clear tube and use something like Mayhems Pastel Blueberry   up to you, top is better as it is in sight and more space however not as easy to drain as a font mount with the ports at the bottom you still need to cool mobo VRM, northbridge ETC. so you still need fans. But it also depends if your fans on the radiator are intake or exhaust for the case. If then you will need lots of fans otehrwise you will suck lots of dust into your case. Yes they come with thermal paste You attach them to the hose - some are threaded, some have compression fittings and will specify the tube size and some even have barbs. put one set (male and female) either side of you graphics card(s) then you can pull them apart with no spill and remove the cards.   7.1x 120mm Radiator space for each component being cooled and add another for good luck. So if you are doing one CPU and one GPU a 360mm will be fine. If you have one CPU and two GPU you should be fine but it wouldn't hurt to get another radiator.   probably need more as you need to account for res and all your tubing. Also you want to flush your system before you fill it for the final time so get some extra for that as well."

Example 1  Example 2  Example 3     Assuming you'll position the fans to push air out the top (matching the natural flow of the hot air) you really shouldn't have any dust falling in.

Never used quick disconnect couplings, so won't comment on that. No simple answer, one 360 would be enough, even more so if you run PP (push/pull, ie. fans on both sides of the rad).

CPU blocks are pretty much ""pick your socket type and look for a block that fits it"" while many CPU blocks fit either most AMD sockets, most Intel sockets or most of both (like the EK Supremacy Evo).  The rest, res, pump, radiators, etc. are all just what you would like to achieve performance wise, what your case supports, and your budget."

watercooling,35x18f,Whitelabl,1 point,Thu May 14 06:45:17 2015 UTC,"I would look at the recessed fitting for a start. Possibly a pressure relief valve as well, always recommend those on larger loops."
watercooling,35x18f,Kautkto,1 point,Thu May 14 09:58:04 2015 UTC,What would this entail?
watercooling,35x18f,Kautkto,1 point,Thu May 14 14:54:07 2015 UTC,Simply changing the port at the top of your res with an aqua computer pressure relief membrane (may need an adapter if it's not g 1/4). And look at an extender for your res as the oring likely isn't forming a good seal where the fitting connects. Sometimes bitspower fittings aren't compatible with certain components.
watercooling,35x18f,Kautkto,1 point,Thu May 14 19:47:59 2015 UTC,"Great idea in theory. But it won't work if I put it on my Res. It could work if I put it on top of the top rad however. With this though, another thought comes to mind. Is it possible to fill the loop to much? when the pressure starts, and the coolant expands from the temperature it has to go somewhere doesn't it?"
watercooling,35x18f,Kautkto,1 point,Thu May 14 20:28:38 2015 UTC,Usually the air pocket in the res can accommodate all thermal expansion. And with the pressure valves they must sit on an air pocket or they will leak.   You can get an adapter that flicks the 3/8 port (if you have one) from the top of your res to 1/4
watercooling,35x18f,Herrowgayboi,1 point,Thu May 14 21:25:41 2015 UTC,"Except... Like I was saying, My res doesn't have an airpocket.. When trying to depressurize, like this would do it fills up comepletely. Like no air whatsoever. The air pocket, if I do have one, will be in my top rad.  To show what I mean, dug up this pic: http://i.imgur.com/0vynKvc.jpg  However the fittings on my res have been swapped."
watercooling,35x18f,Herrowgayboi,1 point,Thu May 14 21:33:10 2015 UTC,"Well empty the res out a bit, shake the system around so that the air bleeds out of the rad. Ah well your loop is small so may not need to depressurise the system. I'm running a dual pump, water-cooled fan controller, sli, cooled mobo 31 fittings system.   Due to the way a radiator works eventually all the air bubbles should make their way to your res."
watercooling,35x18f,give_that_ape_a_tug,1 point,Thu May 14 22:02:22 2015 UTC,"Where they are leaking it is impossible to get to the o-ring, because it swivels. Never unscrews. The fittings are also screwed in as far as is possible, they aren't restrained by the res, or so it seems."

Either fill the res up higher or use (if your res has it) both ports on the bottom."
watercooling,35uf9p,Alestor,1 point,Wed May 13 18:19:02 2015 UTC,"There's a little spout on the inside of the res that the coolant comes through. Though it's falling into the res coolant, it's only a drop of about an inch (maybe even less) from the spout mouth to the surface."
watercooling,35uf9p,VintageCake,5,Wed May 13 20:48:22 2015 UTC,"Thats probably the cause honestly, kind of like your setup is taking a constant pee.  That gap will let air into the loop as well whenever its shut off so you should fill the res until it reaches above the spout so theres no way for air to reenter once flow stops and so theres no waterfall making noise"

If it is...  Seems like your outlet in your pump is lower than the pump. If that's the case, the system is still trying to get rid of the air and it'll take awhile.   Especially, if you dont have an opening to let the air out.  Try to loosen (or take off) the fitting on top of your res (beside the 90*).  That should help the air escape."

Now it runs at about 50% most of the time (machine has only been running for a week, so still have some tuning to do).

Not enough pressure.

You could have a reservoir the size of bottle cap and it would work, though it would make filling the loop quite time consuming. :)  Generally the rule of thumb is the larger the res the fewer times you have to fill it before the loop is full. You might fill a big 240mm res twice to fill a loop, whereas you'll fill a 120mm one four times.   There's zero performance difference between a small and big reservoir, it's all about convenience during the filling process. If I were you, I'd go with the combo. It probably will not line up directly with the plate (my EKWB D5 PWM pump didn't line up with the plate in my Enthoo Primo), but you can mount it like you'd mount the normal reservoir anyway."

watercooling,35tl3e,techno_babble_,1 point,Wed May 13 18:35:47 2015 UTC,"What everyone is saying. Bleed it, then bleed it more, then bleed it again. For my build (tuning in progress), I had to shake it left, right, up, down, did the air bubble dance, a barrel roll. Maybe not that much. But, what I also did, as my radiator was the highest most point is loosen one of the plugs and bleed air out occasionally. There's a reason they put Air Relief Valves at high points in piping systems."

watercooling,35rf2b,Commander_Chiggs,11,Tue May 12 21:58:36 2015 UTC,"Tube reservoirs should be the go to in most cases, bay reservoirs can work, but you'd primarily value them for their aesthetic value over functional utility. Bay reservoirs have a number of small disadvantages over tube. Such as how Bay reservoirs are typically harder to fill as they often have to be physically removed from the case which means they require soft tubing with slack in them, which can ruin the look of interior tubing runs. They're also harder to bleed as the square corners will reintroduce air into the loop which makes them noisier. If you have a pump installed into the reservoir itself, then depending on your setup the vibrations of the pump will transfer into the reservoir which will transfer into the case causing the whole thing to resonate unless you get fancy with dampening materials. This is also an issue with pump-tube reservoir combos, but bay reservoirs tend to be more squat and often hold less water volume which means they don't damp quite as well. Cheaper bay reservoirs are also more likely to develop leaks than tube reservoirs due to their sides being glued together whereas tubes are usually a solid construction with screw on endcaps. With the screwcap tube reservoirs, they are also easier to clean out if you have dye or plasticizer issues whereas you need to spend a lot of time fishing out gunking from bay reservoirs if they don't come apart. I don't consider any of these issues a ""killer"" by itself, and bay reservoirs are certainly a good option depending on what you want. But I do think that a majority of the time people are better served by tube style rather than bay style reservoirs.  It's normally not necessary to get any reservoir with an AIO system, but even AIOs can experience water seepage. Given you have an expandable one, I don't see any problem besides cost in having an extra reservoir in your loop. As the extra reservoir will make it easier to top up the coolant and bleed out air which can lead to a quieter and cooler system."

watercooling,35rf2b,metallives,1 point,Wed May 13 00:24:28 2015 UTC,What about installation wise? Wouldn't a bay res be much easier to install?
watercooling,35rf2b,nono0044,1 point,Wed May 13 00:45:08 2015 UTC,No. Because you have to fir it into a 5.25 bay. The tube you just stick inside and hook the tubes up the bay you have to first clear out a bay then attach the tubes and run the tubes in reverse through the case in order to access them on the other side
watercooling,35rf2b,metallives,1 point,Wed May 13 02:33:34 2015 UTC,I... wha... what are you even trying to say?

watercooling,35rf2b,nono0044,1 point,Wed May 13 11:59:18 2015 UTC,i apologize for the confusion i was a bit drunk last night
watercooling,35rf2b,metallives,1 point,Wed May 13 12:06:53 2015 UTC,"I have no idea what /u/metallives is trying to say, but yes a bay drive is easier to install.    Simply slide it into a 5.25"" bay like any other 5.25"" device.    The problem with bay reservoirs come after putting it in.  Like /u/Wincrest said, you have to leave a bit of slack in the tubing that runs to the reservoir as most need to slide out to be filled.  In addition, getting your hands in the back of the drive bays to tighten fittings can be tricky for some.  Unless your case comes with some sort of mounting point or bracket for a tube reservoir.  You'll most likely need to drill holes for the reservoir mounting clamps, or get clever and mcgyver it.  Trying to to parrot what the others have said, but I want to clarify any confusion this guy seems to have given you."
watercooling,35rf2b,nono0044,1 point,Wed May 13 03:22:07 2015 UTC,bay res's are not easier. with a tube all you do is simple place it inside the case and run tubes
watercooling,35rf2b,metallives,1 point,Wed May 13 12:00:12 2015 UTC,"So does the tube reservoir just float on its own?  Do you just lay it on the floor of the case?  Does it phase through HDD bays and graphic cards?  It needs to be mounted somewhere in the case which may take more steps than simply sliding a bay res in.  I'm not arguing that once mounting a bay res is still easier for other things, but I'm saying that putting one in your case (as long as you have 5.25"" bays) is easier than putting a tube in your case (due to space restraints as well)."
watercooling,35rf2b,metallives,1 point,Wed May 13 14:24:09 2015 UTC,"funny you should mention that, because no mounting hardware came with my res so i just used a zip tie to hold it upright and it actually sits on the floor of the case. lol"
watercooling,35rf2b,ClydeFrog0,1 point,Wed May 13 14:57:50 2015 UTC,of course i have a 900 d so space isnt really an issue. especially since i just took all the HD bays and ssd bays out
watercooling,35rf2b,Alestor,1 point,Wed May 13 14:58:33 2015 UTC,"I have a dual bay res. Nothing vibrates, its easy to fill up, it looks great, and it helps keep my case more organized. Bleeding the loop, filling the loop, doing maintenance on the loop is no problem. I think if you're pump is rattling the shit out of your whole case in any position means you have a pump problem and its probably not mounted correctly.  People use them all the time so get what you think looks/works best for you. I don't think the big basic tube reservoirs look good anyways and you see them in almost every build. Have used both, prefer a bay if I can but sometimes with certain cases it just isn't an option. Get a bottle with a flexible tube and it takes seconds to fill/top off. Draining the loop isn't a problem either and as far as extra tubing you need to pull it out, usually the fill port is towards the front of the res so you only need to slide it out a little bit."
watercooling,35rf2b,Alestor,1 point,Wed May 13 01:28:54 2015 UTC,Hey I have that same case. I personally went with an EK tube res/pump combo that I mounted in the front behind the 200mm fan using an EK 120mm fan adapter mount. I had to use washers to push the 200mm fan forward a centimeter so it cleared the screws holding the res on but other than that it worked well.  I'll make my build complete post later if you want to see it
watercooling,35qrp6,HackThePlanet1337,3,Tue May 12 19:08:04 2015 UTC,"That kit is great. EK is one of the top Watercooling brands.  drains at the lowest point work the best. i think that EK Res/pump combo has an extra port..i would use that for draining if you keep that unit low in your case, also add a bit extra tubing to that res/pump so you can turn it on its side to drain."

watercooling,35qkr3,UF8FF,7,Tue May 12 18:17:57 2015 UTC,"Firstly, acrylic is more rigid, so its prone to cracking a bit more.  Maybe consider using PETG as its a bit softer.  Secondly, based of the third pic (gpu one) looks like your tubing isn't going into the fitting straight.  This could have caused some strain on the tubing and a small bump to your case may have caused it to crack."

watercooling,35qkr3,taztwister,1 point,Tue May 12 18:47:59 2015 UTC,Coolant evaporates faster from PETG than acrylic and all PETG has a slight blue tint. Also I believe UV light yellows PETG.

watercooling,35qkr3,willdenham,1 point,Tue May 12 23:37:52 2015 UTC,Exactly. The reason it's so strong in that sense is that it has polymers that are malleable

watercooling,35qkr3,techno_babble_,3,Wed May 13 02:45:14 2015 UTC,"Common problem with acrylic, when you first heated and bent it, you left a good deal of stress in the plastic. If the bend isn't perfect then fitting it into two hard connection points can introduce further stress. Then multiple heating and cooling cycles can weaken the plastic eventually leading to cracking and leaks. To prevent this, you can make sure your bends are as accurate as you can make them before you install them. On top of that, don't subject it to rapid heating or chilling, try to let the tubing cool naturally instead of chilling it in cold water. And when your tubes are bent, anneal them in an oven before installing them."
watercooling,35qkr3,Wincrest,1 point,Tue May 12 23:35:19 2015 UTC,What do you mean by annealing in an oven?
watercooling,35qkr3,Herrowgayboi,1 point,Wed May 13 00:52:45 2015 UTC,"Here's a quote from plexiglas about annealing.   Annealing consists of prolonged heating of the acrylic part at temperatures lower than those used for forming, followed by slow cooling. Internal stresses set up during fabrication of the article are reduced or eliminated by this treatment.   To do this at home, you can take your acrylic tubes, put them in your oven at a temperature high enough to soften the plastic, but not enough to melt or deform it. If you leave it in there long enough, the molecules in the plastic will settle into a more stable position, relieving stress, sealing small cracks, and making it more stable all around. I believe the sweetspot for acrylic is around 80C or 175F. Normally you'd use a specialized oven with regular air circulation to ensure even heating, but if it's something small and non-major then you can get away with any toaster oven. It's really important that when you let it cool down, you do it very gradually. If your oven doesn't have a function for this, then you might want to turn down the heat over time slowly or cycle it on and off to get it as slow as possible."

watercooling,35q4od,Alestor,2,Tue May 12 17:33:29 2015 UTC,"Well, even if the res is filled to the brim, air is still going to get trapped in the res when it gets there and rises. The air pocket in the res isn't a magnet :P"

watercooling,35m7ai,drunkenvalley,2,Mon May 11 18:20:39 2015 UTC,Oh I was out and only looked through the imgur album.  Maybe invest in a 90 degree fitting so that you don't need the tubing to bend so tightly right out of the card when yo get around to fixing that.

watercooling,35pj74,fijibean,1 point,Tue May 12 13:54:56 2015 UTC,"Radiators need airflow to function.  Using a 360 without a third fan nets you very little if anything over a 240.  According to the product page, this case will support a 280mm radiator (2 x 140).  If it doesn't interfere with the bay drive, I would recommend this route.

This of course is going to limit your big reservoir of course.  EDIT: And to answer your actual question, yes you can mount to the bottom of the case and you should be able to buy a rad mount to drop in there. They also make the pedestal if you need an insane amount of room in the bottom.  Honestly for hyper-specific questions I'd probably email KC from Caselabs, at the CS@caselabs.net email address.

The top rad doesnt allow the front to get lined up at all. only a couple screws holding it in at the front. The botton fan in the front is only held in by tension from the other fans being screwed in. very little room for a d5 pump too. you cant really see it in the pics but its behind the mess of cables under the shroud. for a res i had to use a swiftech mcres and just double sided tape it to the front rad. also taped my hdd and fan controller there too. if you want to save yourself some trouble don't do this. but it was a fun challenge trying to piece the parts together!

watercooling,35kpwv,zerotolerance3,2,Mon May 11 07:56:22 2015 UTC,"I too am confused by this.  Watercooling is definitely the best route for silence in a build with a number of GPUs, but since you said you don't want to do it, that's a bit of a moot point really.  If you just want a good CPU CLC then whack a Corsair H110i GT on and be done with it.  CLCs aren't usually the quietest, but you can control the fan speeds with software and have it so that it's basically silent at idle.  A large 280mm rad as found on the H110 will keep any CPU frosty, just be sure the case you choose has room (don't forget things like clearance rather than just fan mounts)."
watercooling,35kpwv,Makirole,1 point,Mon May 11 11:24:21 2015 UTC,I have changed my mind as it can be seen in the comments of that thread.I will buy any case that is considered best for silence/rad mounts you guys recommend.
watercooling,35kpwv,Makirole,2,Mon May 11 11:57:19 2015 UTC,"Well it's certainly not clear from the comments, had to dig through them to find any hints at watercooling interest.  In any case, if you want a good silent case then a good bet would be a Fractal R5, it's geared for silence and has good radiator options too.  The H440 would also be worth a look for the same reasons.  With watercooling, having more fans will usually result in lower noise as you can run them all at substantially lower RPMs.  As such, larger cases with lots of radiator support also good options.  Given your hardware a Corsair 750D or Phanteks Enthoo Pro/Luxe would also work.  We have a gallery which has every build posted to the sub contained in it.  It's sorted by case so should be easy enough to navigate.  Use that as a resource for gathering info on loop layouts, part choices etc.  We can't choose a loop for you though.  The field is too large and the needs too specific.  Your best bet is to go through our sidebar resources and try to familiarise yourself with the parts and costs.  Then construct a loop parts list and come back for critique."
watercooling,35kpwv,Makirole,1 point,Mon May 11 13:18:15 2015 UTC,"Ek l360 kit , 2 r9290 full cover acetal + nickel with 2 black backplates.And the define r5 case.Is that okay ?"
watercooling,35kpwv,ICanHazTehCookie,2,Mon May 11 14:54:08 2015 UTC,"You're actually quite fortunate as EK updated their kits only the other day, their newer version has a much better pump than the last (a PWM Laing DDC in the new one).  http://www.ekwb.com/shop/kits-cases/kits/ek-kit-l360-r2-0.html  So to that, you'd want your two R9 290 blocks (be sure to check EK's Cooling Configurator to make sure you get the right ones for your intended cards), the backplates (again in the cooling configurator).  You'll also need some extra parts.  You'll need an extra 4 fittings (two for each GPU block) or two fittings and a bridge/terminal to connect the GPU blocks to each other (depends on which block you choose, EK does label which bridges work with each block).  You may need some more tubing, but you'll probably have enough in the standard pack.  Personally, I would also add another radiator, a smaller 240mm.  Since you're not overclocking this isn't 100% necessary, but you can get better results with an extra rad because you have two fairly power hungry gpus.  If you were to get an extra rad you'd need two more fittings and extra fans.  You'll also want to think about fan control.  You can use a splitter cable and drive from the motherboard usually (fine for 3 fans), from there you'd want to control the fan speed curves.  Alternatively, you can use things like NZXT's fan hub.  I try to avoid drive bay fan controllers now as they're bulky and take up space on the front, often in conflict with rads or newer cases.  The pump in that kit is PWM (make sure to check that it is), you'll want to control the RPMs from the motherboard.  Pumps are often the loudest components in a WC loop, but with the right settings they can be for all intents and purposes silent.  My favourite for this is the Laing D5, it's powerful and very quiet, you can dial it down and you won't hear a thing.  The DDC is smaller, but a bit louder, newer versions though are much better than what they used to be.  With PWM control a DDC can be very quiet, again they're also powerful pumps and will easily cope with even the largest loop you could fit in that case.  You may want to think about tubing routing and whether you need any angled adapters.  Sometimes you can build without them, other times they're really necessary.  The way to figure this out is by looking at existing builds and/or drawing out your loop plan.  That should quickly show whether angled fittings would be beneficial.  There's quite a lot to think about there, be sure to be methodical and not rush anything else you'll spend ages waiting for small parts to arrive."

Are you asking for preferences of all in one liquid cooling solutions such as what Corsair offers with the Hydro series?  If you're asking about actual do-it-yourself watercooling loops, there's simply too much for us to tell you in one post. For that I'd recommend reading the side bar and at least the General FAQ there. Beyond learning the basics, we need a lot more information to be able to recommend anything and I know a lot of people will just tell you to get a list of parts together and we can say if it will work or not.

watercooling,35iyy9,ICanHazTehCookie,4,Sun May 10 20:57:52 2015 UTC,Wait ... your using prime in a 4790k ? Stop that immediately.  Prime 95 has issues with i7 chips ca using massive heat spikes. Use adia 64 or how ever it spelled. Also what paste are you using

watercooling,35iyy9,Heyzeus21,2,Sun May 10 21:10:08 2015 UTC,"In addition to the fact that prime95 is no longer a good benchmarking tool for recent i-series chips - haswell and prime95 v.28.5 REALLY don't get along - I think you'll also find that the stock voltages on the 4790k are far beyond what's necessary to maintain stock clocks.   For instance, I set my 4790k to manual vcore, and reduced it all the way to 1.2 while maintaining perfect stability at stock clocks. Whereas the stock voltage setting brought vcore all the way to 1.31 during load. So you might try reducing vcore to get a more realistic temperature."

watercooling,35iyy9,xphx,1 point,Mon May 11 01:21:21 2015 UTC,OCCT is also a nice software to test your CPU.  The temps you now have with Aida64 are more in the target of a stock 4790
watercooling,35iyy9,l00ki3,1 point,Mon May 11 11:04:22 2015 UTC,"Here is an easy explanation:  If it goes up to 70 degrees C almost immediately after starting the test, it has nothing to do with the cooling - the cooling only affects the temperature over longer periods of time. It takes time until the heat from the CPU is transferred to the cooling block, and only that is cooled, so until the heat from the CPU reaches the cooling block, no cooling happens.  Your CPU reaches 70 degrees C immediately, heats up the heatsink and then the cooling actually starts to work, keeping the temperature at 80 degrees C. So the cooling works!  Your CPU goes up to 4.4GHz and depending on the settings of your mainboard, maybe even higher. At that clock speed you just have high temperatures, when you are at maximum load. There isn't anything you can do about it, other than not using a benchmark software to bring it up to maximum load. Because unless you are actually using software such as Handbrake, that actually uses the CPU to 100%, you will never get the CPU to maximum load, and the temperature should stay much lower.  So for real life scenarios just do what you would normally do and then check the temperatures. Playing games? Play a few games and you will notice the temperature staying between 40 degrees C and maybe 65-75 degrees C."

My build has soft tubing so I can't speak for the difficulty of hard lines, but as long as you do all you're research, get everything you need and plan for failure by getting some spare tubes, you should be able to manage.

watercooling,35ijyi,conet,1 point,Mon May 11 04:55:31 2015 UTC,"I did acrylic for my first build. It's not terribly hard to work with, I was able to eyeball everything and bend without mandrels, but if you go that route I'd recommend keeping soft lines and a few fittings on hand for trouble shooting. And if you're in the US, don't go with Bitspower hard fittings, you'll be limited to metric tube sizes, and PPC is about the only place that sells it."
watercooling,35ijyi,SeaJayCJ,-1,Mon May 11 20:18:42 2015 UTC,"Hardline tubing is a total pain in the ass and I personally wouldn't touch it with a ten foot pole, but if you really like the look and you're eventually going to go hardline anyway, you may as well begin with hardline. No sense in building a soft tubing rig then longing for that hardline build that you actually wanted."
watercooling,35hmhg,RimStain,1 point,Sun May 10 13:32:12 2015 UTC,Just finished my first water cooled build. Everything is working fine except the GPU waterblock. I have: http://www.ekwb.com/shop/ek-fc780-gtx-ti-acetal-nickel.html  but the temps skyrocket like there is no cooling. I followed the instructions and everything was assembled correctly. Does it matter which ports I use for in out? I have the inlet and the outlet on opposite sides (inlet is on bottom side outlet on top) but both are on the ports closest to the power inlet end of the card (not offset) would this cause the water to go through without circulating around the cover?  Or is there something else I could be missing?
watercooling,35hmhg,Kautkto,3,Sun May 10 22:33:27 2015 UTC,"Can you take a picture and reply to my comment?   Shit. Just read it again, yes water will be passing straight through your gpu without cooling the components.   You need to offset it. Inlet should be closest to the io plate."
watercooling,35hmhg,RimStain,1 point,Mon May 11 05:03:27 2015 UTC,thanks dude. spot on. it was going straight through. drained it and changed it last night. temps are beautiful now.
watercooling,35hmhg,Herrowgayboi,1 point,Mon May 11 22:42:52 2015 UTC,"I currently apply thermal paste on my CPU using the credit card method, by spreading the thermal paste over the CPU before putting the cooler on. Would this method be okay to use on the gpu as well, or is there a better way to do it?"
watercooling,35hmhg,Kautkto,1 point,Sun May 10 23:37:04 2015 UTC,I think on the gpu it is best to follow the instructions of the gpu but last I heard you need to spread it. For cpu use a rice grain and half sized dot.
watercooling,35hmhg,Retrosmith,1 point,Mon May 11 05:04:25 2015 UTC,"In ten years messing with PCs, doing reviews for a while in the middle plus my own endless tinkering, I've never spread thermal paste.  Not once.  I put a blob in the center about the size of two grains of rice and attach the cooler.  It's worked for air coolers of every different size and shape you can think, both heatpipe direct touch and otherwise, as well as every water block I've used, both on CPU and GPU.    Keep it simple and make it easier on yourself."
watercooling,35hmhg,willdenham,0,Mon May 11 23:20:56 2015 UTC,"I don't know why anyone uses the spreading method at all, ever. There's been plenty of studies that show it either does nothing at all, or actually lowers the effectiveness of the compound.  Put a dot in the center a little bitter than a grain of rice and that's it. No spreading."

watercooling,35hdv0,Apedup,2,Sun May 10 11:26:33 2015 UTC,"no ssd? And I wouldnt use a bay pump/res(or is that only a res?). They are a bit louder.   120 rad for gpu, 120 for cpu and 120 for better temps. You will be finde with 280mm but I would try to use 360mm rad"
watercooling,35hdv0,Karavusk,1 point,Sun May 10 12:10:09 2015 UTC,I think it's only a res. I plan on getting this 512gb ssd in the future. I think that there will be room for 3x 120mm rads in my define r4 so I will probably do that   Thank you for your help :)  EDIT: Do you have any recommendations for a cheap-ish res?
watercooling,35hdv0,Karavusk,1 point,Sun May 10 12:44:18 2015 UTC,I would go with somerhing like this https://www.caseking.de/shop/catalog/EK-Water-Blocks-EK-D5-Vario-X-RES-140::24009.html  and this ssd http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/aw/d/B00P73B1E4/ref=mp_s_a_1_1?qid=1431264010&sr=8-1&pi=AC_SX200_QL40&keywords=samsung+500gb+ssd&dpPl=1&dpID=41fw65-8tpL&ref=plSrch  and always try go get as much rad space as possible!

watercooling,35hdv0,Karavusk,1 point,Sun May 10 13:47:23 2015 UTC,"Oh right :P This should make it a lot cheaper. I just realized that there isn't room for a 360mm rad, will a 280mm rad be okay?"
watercooling,35hdv0,Rub_my_turkey,1 point,Sun May 10 14:12:47 2015 UTC,"yeah its ok, temps are a bit worse but thats ok. Maybe you have room for a 280mm rad and a 120mm?  You can also think about hard tubing and your coolant (maybe colored?)  edit: And maybe some leds?"
watercooling,35hab0,Karavusk,4,Sun May 10 10:21:56 2015 UTC,95 Celsius shouldn't hurt that much?   This is generally the maximum temperature your GPU/CPU will reach before self-throttling to protect themselves from being damaged. They should both be OK :)

watercooling,35hab0,SeaJayCJ,1 point,Sun May 10 10:42:24 2015 UTC,my loop was running for around 3 months with EK-Ekoolant clear. Can I reuse the coolant in my system or should I get a new one?
watercooling,35hab0,SeaJayCJ,1 point,Sun May 10 10:47:03 2015 UTC,No reason not to re-use it if it's clean. I'm a distilled water guy so I don't bother.
watercooling,35hab0,Panduhsaur,1 point,Sun May 10 11:35:46 2015 UTC,If your using clear coolant. I would highly suggest you look into using distilled water. Personally I use distilled water and pure silver.   Distilled water is much cheaper then coolants (it's 1$ for a gallon). And only time I see it being worth it to use coolant is when you want to color coordinate.
watercooling,35hab0,schwiing,1 point,Sun May 10 13:27:40 2015 UTC,"I don't even use silver. Just distilled water, changed every 2-3 months max."
watercooling,35hab0,xNPi,1 point,Sun May 10 13:56:59 2015 UTC,"You should still use some kind of biocide, stuff can grow in your blocks or radiators before you notice anything in the coolant."
watercooling,35hab0,schwiing,1 point,Sun May 10 14:12:48 2015 UTC,"Doubtful that algae will grow in such a short time, and not in sunlight. Honestly, if you have mixed metals in your loop, silver can do more harm than good. I've been running 100% distilled for years and have never had a problem.  Honestly, the reason most use PTnuke or Silver for their loop is because...everyone else does it. Not for a scientific reason. I'm not going to grow algae in a loop thats out of direct sunlight, in 8 weeks. It just doesn't happen."
watercooling,35hab0,schwiing,1 point,Sun May 10 15:57:09 2015 UTC,LinusTechTips did that...  and something was growing in that loop... a lot of it! Just look for his whole room watercooling videos. But yes I dont want silver in my loop thats why I will stick with ek coolant. Can I add mayhems dye to it?
watercooling,35hab0,Alestor,1 point,Sun May 10 18:10:21 2015 UTC,I watched it. He had a steel reservoir and ran automotive coolant through...yeah...He had a very different set up than most. I take apart my water blocks every year and they're just fine.  No growth. No algae.  No silver.  Like I said you have to change out the water frequently but I'm not getting growth and I'm not going to.
watercooling,35hab0,niceandcreamy,1 point,Sun May 10 19:40:09 2015 UTC,"If you're worried about nickel blocks and want to add an anti-algae solution, look for ethylene glycol based biocide. It's confirmed to be safe by EK"
watercooling,35hab0,Panduhsaur,1 point,Sun May 10 19:51:43 2015 UTC,A lot of people rather shell out the extra cash to not have to worry about distilled water.
watercooling,35hab0,niceandcreamy,1 point,Sun May 10 14:13:24 2015 UTC,What's there to worry about? I change it out every six months to a year
watercooling,35hab0,niceandcreamy,1 point,Sun May 10 14:38:21 2015 UTC,I rather never change my coolant until I have to swap out a part or upgrade. And then I can just reuse what I had in there before. No silver(which isn't good for my nickle blocks) and no biocide worries. Just pour and I'm done.
watercooling,35hab0,jesus0nadinosaur,1 point,Sun May 10 14:40:59 2015 UTC,As long as the coolant is clean you can reuse it.

Now with this loop the temp has shot up by about 20, would a larger rad help bring that down? I do have a single fan one that isn't being used but I'm already kind of crunched for space, the 280 radiator is kind of hard for me to place elsewhere"

watercooling,35dc9h,willdenham,2,Sun May 10 00:32:12 2015 UTC,Ok I just noticed that you don't have your front (3) 120mm fans. I assume this is due to spacing with your resiviour. If so you take the filter off and mount the fans on the outside of the case. the front cover is just big enough to slide over the fans. Put those 3 fans in and you should be able to get the intake/exhaust options you will need.

watercooling,35crpt,heyheyhihey,2,Sat May 9 01:38:29 2015 UTC,"The swiftech H240X uses an MCP30 pump which is a detuned MCP50X (only goes to 3000rpm max). Going by comparisons from other we see that its max performance is about half that of the MCP50X and MCP35X which already tells me your pump is definitely not providing you a high enough flowrate given you have a CPU block and two high restriction GPU blocks. Getting a stronger pump would lower your component temperatures. So would spinning your fans faster and louder. But ""better"" fans could also give you lower temperatures for the same noise level. Noctuas are pretty good, but they are definitely inferior to Gentle Typhoon fans for the performance to noise levels.  tl;dr: yes"
watercooling,35crpt,Wincrest,1 point,Sat May 9 02:59:15 2015 UTC,"I think that a MCP50X at 3000 rpm is still quite a bit of head pressure, if he's running the GPUs in parallel."
watercooling,35crpt,xNPi,1 point,Sat May 9 17:52:33 2015 UTC,"Yes, but then you halve the flow rate in the GPU blocks and their temperature rises which is what OP is most concerned about."
watercooling,35crpt,Wincrest,0,Sat May 9 19:17:55 2015 UTC,"Gpu blocks don't need as much flow as CPU blocks. Those temperatures on his GPU aren't concerning at all.  Edit: except for GPU2, the temperature of which would actually be improved by a parallel setup."
watercooling,35crpt,xNPi,0,Sat May 9 20:02:55 2015 UTC,"Please read this. Basic knowledge goes a long way in watercooling.  Running the GPUs in parallel would decrease the overall restrictiveness in the loop, increasing flow rates in everything but the GPU blocks, meaning the CPU would be cooler and the GPU hotter. Running GPU blocks serial means increased overall restrictiveness in comparison which means slower overall flow rates but faster flow rates in the GPU blocks which would mean they run cooler. This is not a big issue when flow rates everywhere are high enough that water can stagnate. But if the overall system restriction is high enough, OP's pump might not even be able to provide adequate flow rates throughout the loop, cutting the flow rate in half in the GPU blocks would only make his GPU temps worse. While most might consider those temperatures fine, OP might prefer lower temps to reduce chip degradation as much as possible."
watercooling,35crpt,Wincrest,1 point,Sat May 9 20:17:57 2015 UTC,"That's the entire point of running it in parallel, you said it yourself. It reduces the restriction so that flow rate overall will be boosted."

Don't worry about damage to it.   However, your load temps seem a bit high.   What fans are you running on your radiator, and at what rpm under load?

watercooling,359i3z,Herrowgayboi,1 point,Fri May 8 15:39:58 2015 UTC,"As far as I know, it's best to put your Res at the highest point, or try to at least in order to bleed out air bubbles faster, because air goes to the highest point. But other than that, theres no real difference.    Always make sure to have your Res higher than your pump though. You want to feed the pump with water with ease. So we use the natural forces of gravity to feed the pump. That way, the first time you fill the pump, there's actually water already at the pump, rather than a pump trying to pull water into it, which would damage it."

watercooling,358225,garwil,2,Fri May 8 01:11:58 2015 UTC,"The pump that comes with that reservoir is a D5, which can be run in any orientation except upside down (in the case of this combo, the pump end would be at the top to achieve this unwanted orientation). So, vertical mounting would be acceptable.   Now, the only thing you have to worry about is your pump running dry. As long as your fluid level is above your feed point, you should be fine. It looks like this combo feeds from the center, so as long as you're above say 60% filled or so, you're good.  I do want to warn about one thing having personal experience with builds involving horizontal reservoirs: they're almost impossible to fill 100% without a fill port elsewhere in the loop. Is you're filling from the reservoir fill port, you will get a bubble. The longer the reservoir length, the less significant this bubble is realative to the total volume of the res. So, because yours is so short, the bubble significance is much higher, making you have to pay more attention to the fluid level.  This mounting configuration wouldn't be impossible to do, but it's going to require more supervision on your part than if you mounted it vertically or used a longer res.   Also, filling systems with a horizontal reservoir is a bitch. So much turning..."

On the other hand you couldorder premixed coolants that are propylene glycol based to avoid needing a killcoil and pt nuke.  These come pre dyed or get a clear version and add your own dye. Any reason you're going with a DCP (other than budget)?  Why not go for a DDC or D5 that have far more reservoir options.  If you are stuck getting the DCP, EK has a pump/res combo.

Unless you have the time (and money), rigid tubing takes a good amount of time and patience to get done correctly. If you mess up a tube run/bend, you'll have to start with a new tube. Also, PETG tubing is better than acryllic as it's much more rigid, and easier to work with.  As far as reservoir size, go for whatever you feel like. Generally, larger is better as it will make it easier to fill the loop."
watercooling,358gvx,Secre7AsianMan,1 point,Fri May 8 00:30:25 2015 UTC,"^ This  Generally speaking, a large res makes it easier to fill and bleed the loop. Aesthetics and available space may dictate a smaller size. There is no wrong answer.  Hard tubing is much more expensive and requires an assortment of tools ... and patience, a lot of patience! It's not difficult, though.  Do your homework on coolant. Some have a very brief life span, some will stain your tubing, some use nano particles for the coloring, which can drop out of suspension over time. Also, distilled water works surprisingly well."
watercooling,358gvx,zardvark,1 point,Fri May 8 01:39:49 2015 UTC,As someone who just completed their first loop with rigid tubing I'd say if you really like the aesthetic you should go for it. It took me about my entire spring break and almost all of my 36 feet of tubing and I wanted to just quit about a thousand times but it was absolutely worth it. Also I highly recommend using some kind of bending tool whether you buy it or make it yourself because it makes bending angles incredibly reliable.  If you can find a colored tubing that you like I say go with that because it's much easier but if you just can't find the right color then go with dye. Some people say it'll gunk up your loop but I'm pretty sure it was proven that was just caused by plasticizer in the tubing so you'll be fine.  Res size really doesn't really matter except it might make filling the loop a little faster since you only have to fill the res twice instead of four times if it's twice the size but other than that it's just aesthetics. As long as you can manage to shut the pump off before it runs dry.

watercooling,358gvx,taztwister,2,Fri May 8 16:13:04 2015 UTC,"Hardest part was absolutely getting the bends in the right place because when tubing had about 4 bends in it just one bend a little too far would basically trash the entire length of what was cut.   But yeah if you're just going with straight tubing and rotary fittings that'd be much easier, can't see anything being too much of a problem if you won't be bending.

watercooling,358gvx,taztwister,1 point,Fri May 8 17:25:41 2015 UTC,Ah. Makes sense I guess to make it as leak proof as possible. Although I did use these fittings which came with a little lock collar you put on the tube for the fitting to compress. Although I wouldn't recommend them because most of the lock collars I got were cracked and I had to order quite a few extras until I got enough that were in good condition.
watercooling,358gvx,time_for_butt_stuff,1 point,Fri May 8 17:42:44 2015 UTC,You could also just use all ek-hd tubes and a ton of fittings. They are already precut and straight so all you would have to do it sand down the end to the correct seating depth and put it into the fitting. The downside is you have to have a smaller case and since all the tubes are precut and smaller than regular tubes (ie you won't find 36 in of tubing but you could fine 10 4 in tubes) you have to do a bit of pre-planning
watercooling,358gvx,metallives,1 point,Fri May 8 07:12:26 2015 UTC,I was planning on doing hard tubing + fitting so that I didn't have to do the bending portion.

I like the look of straight lines though.
watercooling,358gvx,taztwister,1 point,Fri May 8 16:15:02 2015 UTC,"I'd say stick with regular flexible tubing, as Acrylic tubing does require more money, time and patience to get right. Get a res that will fit in your case (obviously), with enough room on top so you can have a fill port."

I have a manual fan controller in the 5.25"" bay.  If you do have yours hooked up to your motherboard there are usually profiles within it so you can have it set them to a silent or low rpm mode. As for the windforce, mine was never very loud but even so, before I watercooled mine, I had manually set the fans to a pretty low rpm and turned off auto through MSI afterburner. They still stayed perfectly cooled and made almost no noise."

I wanted a build that was if a small form factor, allowing easier transportation when gaming with friends without sacrificing cooling power when at home and overclocking. I also wanted to create as clean of a build visually as I could which is where the idea for this came from. I developed a quick disconnect system from S5 to pedestal allowing my to separate the two. The name ""White Metropolis"" started out because I was trying to brainstorm a name that wasn't too cliche with a white build and went with that with no intention of including the name into the theme. That all changed when I got inspired by city silhouettes. In this build you will find the silhouettes of major cities all across the world such as Hong Kong - China, Bangkok - Thailand and Jikarta - Indonesia because of how they looked. I've hopefully succeeded in tying all these things together in a visually appealing, high detail design. Having windows all around led for designing ideas the complement the computer no matter which side you look at it so no matter where you view it from you get a different and equally pleasing view."

watercooling,356vy2,DrRocuronium,2,Fri May 8 21:00:35 2015 UTC,I would say the vibration would be minimal. If you put the foam cushion under the pump and zip-tied the living shit out of it I think that you wouldn't deal with much vibration at all.

watercooling,354mxu,metallives,2,Thu May 7 14:22:45 2015 UTC,Thanks! It was a challenge! I meticulously planned the entire build and modeled every single component in autocad 3D.I used a micrometer to measure everything along with a larger metric ruler to measure the case dimensions inside and out. I poured over product spec sheets and planned everything I purchased around my measurements.   The reason I'm using a random koolance radiator is because they provide 3D models of most of their products for free on their website. I purchased their radiator for that reason. I used their models to help plan my build.   I'm using a Bit Fenix alchemy blue LED strip. I got it from performance-pc .
watercooling,354mxu,metallives,1 point,Fri May 8 18:16:32 2015 UTC,what does delidding do?
watercooling,354mxu,herodrink,3,Thu May 7 13:24:16 2015 UTC,"Intel Ivy Bridge and Haswell CPUs don't have soldered heat spreaders (the silver colored metal top of a CPU is the integrated heat spreader, IHS, the actual silicon CPU is underneath). In the past, the IHS was soldered to the silicon creating a really nice conduit to channel heat out of the CPU, through the IHS and onto your fan/waterblock.   Intel now uses a cheap paste in place of soldering which is far worse than the solder when it comes to heat transfer. Also, the gap between the IHS and the CPU silicon is greater due to a silicone adhesive which is used to glue the IHS to the CPU PCB.   De-lidding refers to the process of removing the IHS either by knocking it off or cutting it loose with razor blade. You then replace the shitty paste Intel used with something of a much higher quality. You also remove the silicone adhesive so when you replace the IHS it makes much better contact due to a reduction in the gap between the two.   I also polished the IHS to a mirror finish using increasingly higher grit sandpaper to flatten the surface even further.   Typically this produces vastly improved temps when overclocked and over-volted but it's a bit of a risky process."

watercooling,355ggo,Bitt3rSteel,2,Thu May 7 07:08:03 2015 UTC,"Copper, nickel and brass play well with each other and are fine to have in a loop. Acetal is a plastic so don't worry about it Barbs hold fine as long as you install them correctly, however I'd recommend you do it once and do it right if you want to do hard lines. As long as you do your fair share of research on how to hard line tubing I'd say you just do it and skip the wasted time and money on barbs and soft tubing Pump control depends on the one you get. A PWM pump will be controlled with a mobo header, a vario pump will be controlled by the dial on the bottom of the casing, or you could get a one speed pump Kill coils don't play well with nickle so avoid them. I forget whether PT Nuke is fine or not but I know ethylene glycol based coolant additives work fine"
watercooling,355ggo,Alestor,1 point,Thu May 7 08:03:05 2015 UTC,"So what do you use as a biocide if you have nickel in your loop? I was under the impression that EK blocks used a lot of nickel, are there alternative blocks for graphics cards?"

watercooling,355ggo,Alestor,0,Thu May 7 17:41:18 2015 UTC,"yes you can mix copper and nickle. acetal is a plastic.  kill coils are fine with copper but don't play well with nickle in my limited experience with barbed fittings they were terrible. i had one pop off the top of the res when i was filling it and water went everywhere. thankfully it didnt get on anything. i would say spend the extra money to get compression fittings.  kill coils are fine if you only use copper. dont use them with nickle though.  as an added side note hard tubing is worth it because it looks cleaner, but it is a bit harder to work with.  if you are uncomfortable with it you should go with soft tubing first"

Cheers :)"
watercooling,3528pv,Zohar127,2,Thu May 7 05:20:49 2015 UTC,"As someone who just finished their first build a few months back my advice to you would be:      Try to plan out everything in advance. Figure out your tubing runs and plan out all of the fittings you'll need to achieve that, then measure twice to make sure everything fits. Determine what tubing inside diameter and outside diameter you'll be using (ID/OD) and make sure you order the right fittings. Figure out what radiators you're using and check their dims to make sure it will fit in your case. Envision where they will sit and make sure you have room to route everything the way you want.  If you're handy and have access to software like AutoCAD or Sketchup use that to pre-plan your build.  Overall, do your research! Try to order everything at once if possible so you don't add up shipping charges on separate orders. Watch build videos on youtube by Ronsanut and Singularity Computers.  They are super informative and it's where I learned pretty much everything for my build."
watercooling,3528pv,Zohar127,1 point,Thu May 7 02:23:11 2015 UTC,"I'm going to watch some more videos, but just from reading your comment it really makes me think it's not for me. I am not handy in the least. I like tinkering that's for sure, but I don't like measuring. I just like to stick stuff where it goes and be on my way. If I have to be precise with the tubing it'll really turn me off."
watercooling,3528pv,creepypriest,2,Thu May 7 02:33:02 2015 UTC,"Planning is pretty much a necessity. The hardware costs add up so it's easy to blow your budget. You don't need to measure your tubing down to the nanometer but the basic premise is the more planning and effort you put into a project, the better it'll turn out. For a single 240mm radiator loop for your 780s you'll need:   2 780 water blocks radiator + fans pump/res/base combo. Like the EK XRES setup 8-10 fittings minimum an sli bridge  tubing tube cutters (don't need but so worth it)  a case that fits it all   It's a fairly expensive project and will be time consuming."
watercooling,3528pv,creepypriest,1 point,Thu May 7 13:13:07 2015 UTC,"Great thanks for this list it really helps. I'm going to continue planning and doing basically everything I can without spending money. If I get it all figured out and feel comfortable, I probably will go for it.

The vids are very professional and his commentary is very enlightening.  Pick one of his builds and then follow the vids (usually 4-5 per build) from start to finish and see what you think.

PCs can actually be considered as something you wont compromise in the dorm considering how important it is to getting your work done.  With that said, your issue may be more so that you have 3 23.5"" monitors. If you live close enough to home that you may end up bringing your rig back and forth, you might want to settle for just bringing 2 over. You should probably keep using your C70 then.  Personally I picked up a Corsair 400R cause there is sort of a plastic handle that I can pick the whole PC off with 1 hand. Good exercise too. Just watch your weight with that. With your C70, you can try looking up if people used a strap with that for transporting.  As always, general rule of thumb is 120mm radiator for every component. You should be fine."

watercooling,350hv8,Herrowgayboi,5,Wed May 6 02:11:50 2015 UTC,The only order that matters is that your res is feeding your pump.
watercooling,350hv8,altaylo4,1 point,Wed May 6 02:14:02 2015 UTC,Definitely true! lol
watercooling,350hv8,Alestor,1 point,Wed May 6 08:07:24 2015 UTC,"To explain more thoroughly, the water in a loop moves so fast that water doesn't remain in the blocks long enough for it to take on enough heat for it to matter. By the time you've even thought of it as cpu block water, it's already made its way through the rad a few times.  Not sure about res max temps but D5 pumps have a maximum rated temperature of 60 celcius. The reason for this is obvious, hot liquid can expand metal, break things and void warranties, you're rad placement isn't linked to it. You shouldn't worry too much about that though, I haven't had my loop long, but I haven't seen the coolant reach 40 degrees with a decent overclock and left folding all day. Worry more about CPU temps than coolant temps"
watercooling,350hv8,Alestor,1 point,Wed May 6 03:38:05 2015 UTC,"You've got a good point. Water is constantly moving so it won't heat up. The only reason why I asked this was because I saw this on XSPC's website, and I got really confused. http://www.xs-pc.com/reservoirs/d5-dual-bay-reservoir That's very true. What temps are you getting though with your CPU in comparison to coolant temps? Very true, I was only wondering since I wasn't sure what this mean't..."
watercooling,350hv8,_Vova,1 point,Wed May 6 08:10:03 2015 UTC,Leaving it folding overnight I was getting between 50-70 degrees with the coolant temps at 35 degrees when I woke up with ambient around 23.

watercooling,350hv8,Alestor,1 point,Wed May 6 09:01:54 2015 UTC,"Not necessarily, I've burned out a pump without my processor overheating."

watercooling,350hv8,_Vova,2,Wed May 6 17:41:50 2015 UTC,Yup. I use stacked rads in my 9ine04 build and started with 800rpm eLoops that didn't really push any air through the rads so when the CPU hit ~80° the coolant was over 60° - the rads and tubing were very warm to the touch. It was pretty much cooled passively and ended up burning the pump.
watercooling,350hv8,_Vova,1 point,Wed May 6 20:04:25 2015 UTC,"Very noob question, but is there a difference between fans (Static pressure and air flow)? I know SP fans are better for Rad's, but would normal fans work just as fine?"

If your rad has 30fpi, static pressure will make more of a difference than on a rad with 15fpi. I'd always recommend lower fpi rads so you can use quieter fans.   My unorthodox setup goes fan>rad>fan>rad>fan>rad>fan>rad all in one big stack with no space in between."

watercooling,34yop1,zardvark,1 point,Tue May 5 21:07:16 2015 UTC,"Also, the main reason for picking the red H440 was because it's all sheet metal with a shiny finish like the white version. These two are much more scratch resistant than the black versions with colored trim."

The general rule from what I remember is 120x30mm per 100 watts or so. So for example you could use the corsair h60 for a 4790k but for it to properly cool at load you would need to have the fans cranked. Also for rads to really work well you need air flowing over them.

watercooling,34w1m9,johnty123,1 point,Tue May 5 01:46:13 2015 UTC,"depends what else you're trying to stuff into the case, i'd say its not too bad... people can make it work in even smaller cases (see recent 350D crossfire build... granted the bay res does save you some space, and you're left with very little drive mount options....)"
watercooling,34w1m9,DrRocuronium,1 point,Tue May 5 03:19:47 2015 UTC,"You're right. It's honestly not that bad of a size, but issue is i'd like to remain functionality of another HDD. To do this i'd either have to have a bay res and keep the HDD cage which limits my rad mount options, or I get a stand alone pump/res and use the bayres for mounting HDD and possibly the optical drive."
watercooling,34w1m9,DrRocuronium,1 point,Tue May 5 03:21:46 2015 UTC,For my build I am having to ditch my 5.25 drive bays. Although the trade off for a sweet custom loop or an optical drive was an easy choice. Plus we can always grab externals.  That sounded dirty as fuck
watercooling,34w1m9,domp_,1 point,Tue May 5 06:21:29 2015 UTC,"lol you make a pretty valid point. Only problem is that I have my OS and main apps on my SSD, and games/other files on my HDD. I know USB 3.0 has a high transfer speed, but I'm not too sure it will be capable with running a game through it. As far as optical drives go, you're right it's easy to get an external. But so far I just can't find a usb 3.0 optical drive.. unless i'm looking somewhere else...?"
watercooling,34unm0,Herrowgayboi,1 point,Mon May 4 18:29:27 2015 UTC,"The idea of a rear exhaust fan is to keep the air moving from front to back in the case, this helps cool a lot of passive components that are (likely) not touched by your loop, such as RAM, the VRM on your motherboard, etc. That top exhaust fan helps pull away some heat.  Now that being said, as long as you've got nice airflow from the front and plenty pushing air out the top you shouldn't see a major issue at all. Maybe a couple of degrees difference at the most."
watercooling,34unm0,willdenham,1 point,Mon May 4 18:45:45 2015 UTC,So the removal of the rear exhaust fan wont be something to worry about in the temps department then..?
watercooling,34vbn3,Sirtaco11,3,Mon May 4 21:27:50 2015 UTC,"Depends what you are looking to do.  The h100i and all other closed loop coolers like it are a great middle ground between air cooling and full blown custom.  The upsides are little to no maintenance, or building.  It comes pre-made.  You don't have to put it together, but that means you can't take it apart or add to it.  A full custom loop is the step above.  This is using unique parts that you assemble.  A heat transfer device that moves the heat to the water, a radiator to let that heat into the air, a pump to move the water, a reservoir to hold excess water, and tubing to connect it all.  Custom loops will always be more expensive than a premade closed system, but with the benefits of being able to do more."
watercooling,34vbn3,sparky11080,3,Tue May 5 02:44:47 2015 UTC,Depends how much are you willing to spend and what are your goals. Tell us a little bit more. :) Do you want a silent computer or will you dive into overclocking? Do you want to cool your GPU in the future?

watercooling,34t8o9,willdenham,1 point,Mon May 4 12:37:10 2015 UTC,"The main factor in case selection is going to be radiator support. Everyone generally recommends at least 120mm of radiator surface per component, plus a little extra so you're looking at 480mm total space (can be two 240mm rads of course or a combination of others).   Do you know what rads you're going to buy?  Also as an owner of the H440, I'd pick the Noctis 450 over it simply for ventilation if you do not need the sound dampening material. They use the exact same chassis, just different front/top panels and a different side window. The rest is the same (except for the H440's sound dampening material in the panels)."

watercooling,34t47i,unhappyemo,1 point,Mon May 4 10:19:11 2015 UTC,Welcome. The fan question its preference to do push/pull/push-pull. It's all up to your fin density in the rad I'm pretty sure. Most fans will be able to push though the rads just fine.   If you're using Nvidia your parts will stay cooler compared to AMD. Then again your temps will be based around the ambient temperature of the room you're in using the computer.
watercooling,34t47i,unhappyemo,1 point,Mon May 4 10:32:06 2015 UTC,"Ok, I will try with just 4 fans per rad first and see what temps I get.  The AMD/ nVidia thing changes from generation to generation though,  right now with Maxwell we get these super efficient low power chips but that was not the case when, say, Fermi was around.  Right now AMD cards have a higher thermal output than the nVidia equivalent, that may change in the future though."
watercooling,34t47i,SeaJayCJ,2,Mon May 4 11:53:34 2015 UTC,Sounds like a plan. If your don't like the current temps it won't hurt to order more fans and wait a week to get them to run push pull. I just recently went push pull but my rads aren't even in my case yet. I have them ghetto rigged on my 900D box. I'm hoping the new AMD card is gonna be cooler so I can justify possibly getting two of them in the future for crossfire.
watercooling,34t47i,SeaJayCJ,2,Mon May 4 11:59:10 2015 UTC,"One D5 should be fine. Rads aren't very restrictive. Fat rads are even less restrictive than thin, as I understand it. You will get a little bit better low-rpm performance. I advise you see how you go with a single set before shelling out for push-pull."
watercooling,34t47i,metallives,1 point,Mon May 4 10:32:00 2015 UTC,"Ok, thank you!  I'm thinking of going with EK's D5 Vario Pump/Res- combo and changing the reservoir tube to a 200- or 300mm one.  Hope to have enough cooling with two thick 480's that I can run the SP120's at a low RPM, I'll try it out with just four fans per rad and see if I like the temps."
watercooling,34t47i,metallives,1 point,Mon May 4 11:57:59 2015 UTC,I'm thinking of going with EK's D5 Vario Pump/Res- combo and changing the reservoir tube to a 200- or 300mm one.   Just construct your own pump/res combo. Take a D5 with a custom top that allows intake from the top. Then connect a reservoir of your choice using a male-male G1/4 extender.

With the bottom cage gone its possible to do maybe a 120 in the front or a 240/280 at the bottom depending on how long the psu is.

watercooling,34r8sj,Curator911,2,Sun May 3 21:35:44 2015 UTC,"Case: the 900D is HUGE and will fit pretty much anything you want. An Enthoo Primo is also a great choice - it's quite a bit cheaper than the 900D but offers everything you need. Both are outstanding watercooling cases but I'd lean slightly towards the Enthoo Primo. Not really sure about the NZXT.  Radiators: The general rule is 120mm of radiator per component plus an extra 120mm. In your case I'd suggest a minimum 360mm + 240mm to provide headroom for overclocking. In a 900D/Enthoo Primo you could fit 2 480mm radiators so it's entirely up to you. Hardwarelabs, Alphacool and XSPC offer great rads.  Pump: I'd suggest a D5 - silent and plenty of pressure. A DDC 3.2 is also a possible choice here.  Reservoir: Have you considered a pump/res combo such as EK's D5 X-RES? comes in a variety of sizes. A resevoir is kind of personal choice, pick what will fit in your build and be easy to access for filling etc.   Edit: to answer your point about 120/140mm radiators here's some ghetto maths.  Quad 120 - 120x480=57600.  Triple 140 - 140x420=58800.  Basically, assuming identical fin density, thickness etc, a triple 140 will have very slightly more surface area."

watercooling,34r8sj,unhappyemo,1 point,Mon May 4 01:20:48 2015 UTC,To add on to his comment.  Try to get a D5 Variable speed pump if you find it for a good price. Adjustable speed makes bleeding slightly easier and can give you a little bit of extra power if you ever need to turn the pump up to the highest setting.
watercooling,34r8sj,unhappyemo,1 point,Mon May 4 14:47:32 2015 UTC,"I was thinking about getting a variable model but how does one connect the pump to a power supply? a series of adapters or would it work off a mobo header?

Jay's Two Cents Skunkworks V3 looks fantastic like that and he claims its runs better too, but is it worth the extra cash."

This just does not seem like a very thought out idea and your distrust of clc is silly:   Customers could potentially mess with the loop and cause leaks, which you have to deal with based on your warranty Do you really want the headache of trying to diagnose a loop if your customer will be unable to tell you whats going on  While it is a good idea to have loop maintenance every year, its going to be a lot of work for you.  And moving around a computer with a loop is also not the greatest idea. You don't need to check a closed cooler, they're generally well designed now and perform fairly well.  The only problem they have nowadays is pump failure.  If that happens, then you can just take it off and either RMA it or chuck it and get a new one for like 60 bucks a pop"
watercooling,34qd8d,nono0044,2,Sun May 3 17:28:59 2015 UTC,"How much knowledge do you have about watercooling and putting a loop together?   I am running a few of my own computers with custom loops for a few years now - even though I certainly lack experience, the concept of building loops is fairly simple.   Customers could potentially mess with   My customers certainly all have the knowledge of building a computer on their own, but simply don't have the time for it. They don't want to mess with it. Of course they could open it up and break something, but they can do that with an air-cooled computer as well.   trying to diagnose a loop   We offer on-site service and do not ask our customers to do troubleshooting.   While it is a good idea to have loop maintenance every year, its going to be a lot of work for you. And moving around a computer with a loop is also not the greatest idea.  You don't need to check a closed cooler, they're generally well designed now and perform fairly well.   Even if I were to accept that, what Asetek and others offer are generic GPU coolers that cool the chip instead of the whole card (like EK Water Blocks does which I plan to use) and furthermore they just offer a single fan. Those coolers are not supposed to be silent, instead they are offered to overclocking enthusiasts.  On my current gaming computer I have a 290x cooled with two 120mm fans on the radiator, and this is just silent enough to start hearing the PSU fan under load, and that is the silence level I am aiming for. The closed loops do not fit that requirement.   While it is a good idea to have loop maintenance every year, its going to be a lot of work for you. And moving around a computer with a loop is also not the greatest idea.   That's exactly what I am saying - it will be quite a bit of additional work versus a traditional air cooled computer. And that is alright, what I wonder about is how often I need to do maintenance. Perhaps I can drain and refill the loop without cleaning each component? I can do that on-site easily, but taking it apart for cleaning could not be a quick half-hour job."
watercooling,34qd8d,beautifulagony,2,Sun May 3 19:27:55 2015 UTC,"Cool.  It's just that theres far more that can go wrong with watercooling and the way your warranty is set up can really screw you over easy.  Stemming from the first point.  Yes, air-cooling set ups can be messed with and screwed up.  But when watercooling goes wrong, it can go very very wrong with something as small as a loose fitting.  So if you are going to give a warranty thats so no questions asked, you're asking for trouble.  That is a good point about AIO, but to paint a broad brush and ignore them for things such as maintenance is silly.  Yeah, 6 months or a year is good for maintenance.  But yeah, just draining the loop or topping it off doesn't really accomplish much.  Maybe the coolant will get a bit dirty, but if theres going to be problems its going to be in the actual blocks.   So I guess thats what you'll have to be ready for if you are going to offer the services."
watercooling,34qd8d,metallives,2,Sun May 3 19:49:39 2015 UTC,"when watercooling goes wrong, it can go very very wrong with something as small as a loose fitting   I do use hose clamps and set them up so that you might rip the graphics card out of its slot before the tube gets loose. A loose fitting happened to me once before and I noticed it within the first 24 hour test. After that, I never had a problem with it again. Hose clamps don't get loose over time either, so if it doesn't leak within the first 24 hours, that will be good enough for me.   if you are going to give a warranty thats so no questions asked, you're asking for trouble   So far this warranty has not been needed more than a handful of times, but it's something that sets us apart from the competition and it shows that we trust in our products. Changing the warranty terms for watercooled computers only would mean that we don't have as much faith in those computers. But I would certainly include a necessary drain+refill once per year in the warranty terms.   if theres going to be problems its going to be in the actual blocks   You mean degradation? I am not sure if I understand. In my computers I use the same blocks for years and perhaps the temperature is a little higher, but otherwise I notice no changes.  I just had an idea: If I do watercooling only for the graphics card (all the current 1150/2011-3 CPUs can be silently cooled with air cooling), I can set it up so that if a leak does occur, it would not come in contact with the components at all. There is only the bottom of the case below the graphics card, and I can seal off the one side with the mainboard and the other side with all the other loop components.  We have our own custom case anyway, so I can just create an additional version of it that allows me to seperate the loop from the components and perhaps install something that collects cooling liquid on the bottom if there's a leak. Attach a sensor that registers the fluid and warns the customer. That shouldn't be too hard."
watercooling,34qd8d,metallives,1 point,Sun May 3 20:15:34 2015 UTC,"No compression fittings?  Its not so much as there isn't faith in your products, but a matter of protecting yourself and your business when you offer products that have a higher cost to repair if something does go wrong.  I mean on the off change that theres gunking and stuff (which shouldn't be an issue if you do everything correctly), a simple coolant change will not solve the issue.  So if you are planning to make maintenance a thing and be worth it, then you should take things apart to clean.  Why not go for a g10 or something similar if you plan to add all that hassle just for a gpu loop.    All I'm saying is that right now, you're giving up a lot of things just to offer silence and cooling performance.  So yeah, I guess its your decision to make in the end."

Straight tube (long curve run) from 360 to 240. Use a 90 straight down from 240 and curve into pump.  It needed use a 90 into pump so tube comes in at correct angle.

As for the drain, a cross flow would work there, but you will probably find you may utilize the ground space down there.  I would reconsider that plan.  Definitely get the case and parts BEFORE you order all the watercooling stuff like tubes and fittings.  You will find your plan will probably change when the stuff is actually in there.

watercooling,34ppr0,Retrosmith,2,Mon May 4 02:21:11 2015 UTC,You can make 90-degree fittings easily enough by putting their fittings  into a double-female 90-degree threaded elbow.  It would be expensive but it would keep your lines straight.  Just a thought.
watercooling,34ppr0,turbo_customs,2,Mon May 4 02:49:34 2015 UTC,"Mandrels or a jig along with a good set or rulers are a must if you are a stickler for detail.  Trust me - once you are done all you will see are the flaws, no matter how good anyone else thinks it looks.  Look at all the complete hardline loops you see here and notice how you rarely get to see bends straight-on.  That's because the bender often knows it looks bad straight on :)  I am certainly guilty of this for some of my work.  Sometimes you have to take the best of ten attempts on complex bends and accept it.       If using acrylic, take your time when heating it.  Heat a 2-3"" portion of the tube on a moderate heat over the course of a few minutes, it should start to become glassy.  Once it bends easily under its own weight, it's ready.  Bending before that point will result in bulges at worst and kinks at best. I found that once I started dipping the silicone insert in soapy water, I got better results.  It seems to help with reducing friction when bending.  I didn't need it to get the insert out, but it definitely helped produce flawless bends.       You can also make tiny adjustments to your existing bends with low heat, while its in place and without a silicone insert.  However do that at your own risk - there's a fine line between just enough heat to make a tiny adjustment and enough to have the tube burst or collapse."

Was leaking where you insert the tube into the fitting (o-ring not getting a proper seal). It started off okay when I first built it, a minor leak. Then it cleared up. I set my computer to mine over springbreak, came back to find it had leaked a little bit. Just did a fan replacement in my PSU, and I had drained my loop so I could clean the mess that the leak had caused. Filled 'er back up and I had a terrible leak in the same place.

watercooling,34ma0q,metallives,1 point,Mon May 4 12:19:43 2015 UTC,No we don't have smaller fittings.  2 of our EK-HD Adapters should fit in this tight space but you will barely see the tubing in between them.  So you won't really see the coolant running through them.  So the bridge might be the best solution in your case.
watercooling,34mu0t,qusaifares10,1 point,Sat May 2 16:23:44 2015 UTC,"Use primochill advanced lrt tubing. For res, best glass one is the aqua computer. Use mayhems dye and biocide or go for a pastel (mayhems produce the ek one so either brand is fine). Pastel has anti corrosives and anti growth agents in it. Dye isn't what gums the loop, that was plasticiser leaching from the tubing. The dye then stains that, which made some assume it was the dye.   Another thing to note. When you get your radiators flush them 4-5 times with hot water and white vinegar. Leave sitting for ten minutes a time, rinse and repeat until there's no more flux or gunk in the sink (I actually use a bowl for this, can see the discarded product even better)   D5 vario or aquastream (not as powerful but more features and super quiet such as tachometer and temp sensors, fan controller) . Even a ddc will work for a small loop like yours. Something to consider, the d5/mcp655 don't have the best stock pump tops and they aren't generally threaded but that's a super easy fix.   As for fittings. Bitspower/barrow are the best but almost any will do fine. If you need to get angled fittings then only consider barrow or bitspower.   And for fans... Not usually at the top of the consideration list for most people but important regardless. Try get gentle typhoon ap15s or yate loons. Both are great for radiators and super quiet. Failing that, do your research and ask your questions. You want high static pressure above all else.   Best rads are the xspc rx, or black ice gts. You'll need 360mm of rad space minimum (can be split up into two or even 3 rads) to operate at a near silent level of cooling. Can always add another rad when you add the gpu.   Regarding leak testing.. Test outside of the case before you start installing.  It's a good way to check for faulty components, which although rare do happen.  Then, when you do start installing. Paper towels everywhere. They are your best friend."

No colour will gunk up your system.  Its been pretty much debunked that coloured coolant causes gunking.  Its plasticizer from bad tubing that good dyed that people thought was the gunk from coolants.  The issue with colours and dyes is that they will eventually stain (dye) your components.  Some colours will cause staining faster, with red/pink are the worst for that.  Hope that clears things up."

watercooling,34lynk,ambientcloud,3,Sat May 2 09:57:16 2015 UTC,"Define S is relatively new so not many examples to glean from.  Lovely case to build a WC setup into. You don't necessarily need to run separate loops for the CPU and GPU.  Depends on what your goal is.  If you want to OC the nuts off specific components, separate loops might be beneficial given the huge amount of heat a 295x2 puts out.  If you are more concerned with keeping noise to a minimum, a single loop would provide greater overall cooling capacity, so you can runs your fans at a lower rpm.    Not sure what you mean by separate exhausts and separate blocks.  Whether you have one loop or two loops, you should have all the rads bringing air into the case.  It may seem counter intuitive to drop the warm air from the rads into the case, but you will get the best performance if you feed your rads the coolest air available.  Combine that with a slow, large exhaust fan and you have a nice positive pressure setup meaning good airflow for passively cooled components.  You have lots of options with radiator placement with this case (see page 17 of the PDF).  If I was building your system I would build a single loop and the first rad setup I would consider is one 360 rad in the top and one in the front, and a large exhaust fan at the back.  The absolute minimum is generally 120mm of rad per component but given that both 4790 and 295x2 run hot I would drop two 360s in there so I could run the system nice and quiet. Hope that helps."

watercooling,34jvxz,DrRocuronium,2,Fri May 1 19:55:32 2015 UTC,"That seems like a very expensive place to put the flow indicator. Why not connect it directly to one of your rads and save two compression fittings?  Also using a 90 degree fitting on your CPU block might make it hard to run the tube it's connected to. Usually you'll want some ""vertical"" distance so that you can clear your GPU, not run in to RAM or motherboard heat sinks, etc."
watercooling,34jvxz,SharkSpider,1 point,Fri May 1 21:55:12 2015 UTC,"I would still need at least one compression fitting due to how to flow indicator was made. I can unscrew one side and connect it to G1/4, but the other REQUIRES a fitting assuming I want to put tubing on it.   I love the super high visibility of it right by the CPU and since I would have to use at least one fitting, so the extra $6.99 really wouldn't seem like too much more of a cost.   Also using a 90 degree fitting on your CPU block might make it hard to run the tube it's connected to.   That is great advice. I'll just use the straight fittings instead on the CPU as they'll save me a little money and to be honest I think they look better than the other fittings.    Thank you so much. You guys are awesome."
watercooling,34jvxz,SharkSpider,1 point,Sat May 2 03:43:12 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure the flow indicator could save two fittings. You use four total in the run that includes it, you could use two if it was attached to a radiator."

My thought was that if I went with a separate pump tube-connected to the bay res it should be workable, and your post seems to confirm that hypothesis."
watercooling,34j3oy,bonsainovice,1 point,Fri May 1 21:49:56 2015 UTC,"As I see it, the best way to have a reservoir is in the diskbays: It's the highest point on the case so it's great for bleeding out air in the system and it gives a perfect direct view of the water levels (specially with a windowless case).  The thing about having the pump connected this way is to make sure that it's always wet and that water flow is unrestricted to eliminate the risk of running it dry or with cavitation which in both cases would destroy the pump."
watercooling,34j3oy,bonsainovice,1 point,Sat May 2 06:05:38 2015 UTC,"As long as the reservoir is above the pump, and the pump is  the first item in the loop after the res, shouldn't that keep the pump wet and avoid cavitation as well?"
watercooling,34j3oy,335is,1 point,Mon May 4 13:56:59 2015 UTC,I currently have a top rad just before the res. Had the res been much lower bubbles would've had a harder time reaching the res.
watercooling,34kxbz,millkmiller,3,Sat May 2 01:34:45 2015 UTC,The best thing to do is draw your setup out on paper. Make circles on each component representing your connectors. Then list on the side of that drawing a total of each type of connector used in the drawing.  The sucky thing about not ordering enough connectors is you can't go into a retail store and buy more. That grinds your build to a halt.
watercooling,34kxbz,mscott121279,2,Sat May 2 07:01:41 2015 UTC,You'll need a minimum of 2 per component.  So you'll need at least 12. You may need more depending on your setup.

watercooling,34h4lp,mater36,3,Fri May 1 02:38:07 2015 UTC,That black tube looks really good.  Blends right in.  Only complaint is you could use a 45 or 90 degree fitting on that rear rad and really make everything look cleaner
watercooling,34h4lp,erickliban,1 point,Fri May 1 03:24:09 2015 UTC,As weird as this might seem I was tight on budget. I really wanted to have the highest end gpu available and so I did. I'll tear the build apart and add some angled fittings when ever I have money to upgrade cpu platform. And I forgot to mention in the specs that the tubing is ek zmt tubing. And it was a little bit too big to fit on the compressions. I should of sent it back but I had gone too far and wanted the build done. Ended up with some scratches on some of the fittings and it took forever to get each one screwed on.

watercooling,34h4lp,i_mormon_stuff,1 point,Fri May 1 04:55:21 2015 UTC,"I really do like it. But it is your own decision if it's worth 1k to you. I'll never use the 12gb fb anytime soon so if you wanted one maybe you could wait until the 980ti is announced and released. But there is no game I can't max out with AA cranked at 100 fps+ at my current 1680x1050 resolution. It's overkill for that but I want a ultra wide 1440 or 144hz 1440. One complaint though is that it actually does run very hot. Under air you won't make it past 1400mhz because of power, voltage, and thermal limits all being triggered at the same time. Watercool it and custom 350/450w bios  and it can be pushed so much further. But I now know I won't need a room heater for next winter. And I'm not saying that in a joke full way. I seriously won't need heating."

watercooling,34h4lp,Diverk111,1 point,Fri May 1 11:27:11 2015 UTC,Yea that triple setup would be where titans would be better than waiting for cheaper 980ti
watercooling,34h4lp,Diverk111,1 point,Fri May 1 12:33:50 2015 UTC,I was actually thinking about a really similar build so I'm worried when you mention the x running hot. Do you have the temps by chance? I'd really love to know just how hot it gets.
watercooling,34h4lp,Diverk111,1 point,Fri May 1 16:16:39 2015 UTC,Before watercooling it would easily go to 80c but after my max load has been 50 when I had fan speed at 20% on grid+ at 100% fan speed it won't break 45. The h440 has really bad airflow though and if I take the panels off it will be at about 40c. This is with more voltage and power too so I'm impressed with the temp afterwards.
watercooling,34h4lp,Bitt3rSteel,1 point,Fri May 1 18:32:25 2015 UTC,Nice! Sorry for all the questions but how loud does this rig get? I was hoping for something almost silent but I may not be able to do that with the h440

watercooling,34h4lp,flipacoinbot,1 point,Fri May 1 16:59:20 2015 UTC,The USB connection is not solid at all. Just putting on the side panels can get it to move and not be detected. Depends how you mount it but it can be better. You don't get individual control of fans. You can use splitters and it handles up to 30w and I'm not even close to that limit with 9fans.software used to be super buggy but it is mostly fixed now. Cam takes forever to launch even though it's installed on two ssds in raid 0. You can set speed to 0% now. Some old reviews said you couldn't but it's fixed. You also can't have a smooth temp curve. It's blocky and goes up by 10% increments only. And you can't control fan speed on both cpu and gpu. Like if only your gpu is getting slammed and it's set to follow cpu temp fans won't speed up. All of not most of my problems are with the software and if they fix it I would love it much more. But it's a nice small option when you don't have mobo spots or  cd bays

watercooling,34h1uk,bonsainovice,3,Fri May 1 02:13:27 2015 UTC,"Don't need to get PWM fans to use the hub.  The fan hub on the Luxe is PWM controlled, so 3 pin fans will work.  Depends on you.  The more rad space you have, the more potential for cooling and ability to run fans at lower speeds (for less noise)."
watercooling,34h1uk,nono0044,1 point,Fri May 1 02:56:56 2015 UTC,"so it doesn't matter if the fans coming off the hub are pwm or not? How does that work -- the pwm signal to the hub determines an on/off voltage modulation and all the attached fans follow it? That makes sense, I had just assumed that it required PWM fans.   Yeah, I'm leaning towards putting another rad in, but I wanted to see what folks thought. My total wattage I've got to dissipate should only be around 225, which is a bit more than the GTS will likely handle at 1gallon/sec flow and 1000 rpm, but if I don't drop that second rad in the bottom I'll end up with a lot more space to work with. Again, I'm sitting on the fence and hoping the responses give me a good push one way or another. :)"
watercooling,34h1uk,nono0044,2,Fri May 1 03:33:04 2015 UTC,"The Phanteks PWM Fan Hub is capable of powering up to *11x fans (3-pin) through PWM modulation, while occupying only 1x 4-pin header of your motherboard per Fan Hub. At the same time this Fan Hub also keeps your chassis interior clean and tidy by centralizing all your fan cables. The PWM hub comes with pre-drilled mounting holes for easy installation to your Enthoo cases and also Velcro strips for use with other chassis. Power LED illuminates the Phanteks Logo when the PWM hub is powered on.   This is the description taken off the phanteks pwm fan hub product page (which is essentially the one inside the pro and luxe).  In fact, all the headers on the hub are 3 pin anyway.  Well theres lots of space in the Luxe, so if you aren't gonna use the space for rads, it'd be a real shame ;)"
watercooling,34h1uk,nono0044,1 point,Fri May 1 03:45:22 2015 UTC,"Clearly, I need to work on my reading comprehension skills. ;)  Fine, FINE! I'll put in a second Rad. So the real question: front or bottom? I'll likely stick with the GTS series so I can stay push/pull and have all the fans off the single hub.   Edit: And what about airflow? I've read some setups where folks just go inflow for all fans and just let the case aspirate."
watercooling,34h1uk,usually_sane,1 point,Fri May 1 03:51:14 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it'll be a good idea to keep the 360 up top so the all the fans can get to the hub.  It's really up to you.  If you need the hard drive cages, do bottom or a 120 in the front.  If not, a 240 in the front push pull is possible.  Also, you could stick a 120/140 in the back if you don't want to put anything in the front.  Doesn't make too much of a difference.  I have a 240 rad in the front as intake, 360 rad up top as exhaust, a 140 fan intake at bottom, and a 120 fan exhaust at the back.  Temps are okay with the way I have it.  Just make sure theres enough air going through your rads"

watercooling,34ff14,sarge21rvb,4,Thu Apr 30 18:16:18 2015 UTC,"I'd tend towards no. I doubt the performance on water will be as good as with a full cover block, and once you have a water cooling set up you might not want the fan noise. Why not just get a regular Strix 980 (or any other brand) and then buy a block for it when you make your loop?"
watercooling,34ff14,SharkSpider,3,Thu Apr 30 19:07:11 2015 UTC,"Price, ease of use, and also warranty. If I pull apart the cooler and put a custom block on, I'll be voiding the warranty. It also ends up being cheaper to get the Poseidon vs the STRIX and a block. In the reviews I've read and a bunch of benchmarks, people seem to have the Poseidon under 50C at full load while overclocked. I'm not sure how that compares to a custom block and loop, as I haven't seen any benchmarks comparing the two.   The fan noise is a concern, but I imagine they'll be off or near silent when the card is water cooled. I haven't seen any info on that either."

watercooling,34ff14,Fationably_Late,2,Thu Apr 30 22:47:16 2015 UTC,"The warranty really isn't a concern. If it's valid for RMA they'll take it as long as you put the stock cooler back on. If it's a big deal buy EVGA, they don't void warranties if you pull off the reference cooler. Performance-wise the temps aren't going to be much different with a full block, but most of that is going to be the air cooler. The water just gets piped through in a loop and there's no fin setup over the die like you'd get with an aftermarket block. You'd also need to check what metal the pipes are made of, since in the pictures it looks like aluminum, which would require an aluminum radiator.  Price and ease of use, sure, but it really isn't going to give you the benefits of full water cooling, and the price difference will be next to nothing compared to how much it costs to build a custom loop."

watercooling,34ec9l,millkmiller,1 point,Thu Apr 30 17:34:55 2015 UTC,XSPC Razor GTX 980 is the one im looking at
watercooling,34ec9l,nono0044,1 point,Thu Apr 30 17:36:37 2015 UTC,XSPC is already one of the more affordable brands.  Not really sure you can find much cheaper than that.  Keep an eye out for retailer coupons or buy used.  Used blocks can be a good steal as long as the block is in good shape.
watercooling,34ec9l,Nup5u,1 point,Thu Apr 30 17:44:08 2015 UTC,"Absolutely agree about used parts. One of the big things to look at when getting something used block is the threads. If they're mangled, move along."

watercooling,34ec9l,Nup5u,2,Thu Apr 30 18:47:45 2015 UTC,Its not stupid at all.   Ita something to tide you over.  That setup is fine.   Just make sure your CPU block has all the CPU brackets for all sockets.
watercooling,34ec9l,Whitelabl,1 point,Thu Apr 30 20:01:14 2015 UTC,"thanks man, appreciate the help what if i add the gpu block in the future do i need another 240 rad to the mix?"
watercooling,34ec9l,Nup5u,1 point,Thu Apr 30 20:21:49 2015 UTC,"If your budget allows,  try to fit as much rads as possible in the case you planning to purchase.   I prefer to over rad so i could keep my fans relatively quiet and still achieve a pretty good delta T."
watercooling,34ec9l,Whitelabl,1 point,Thu Apr 30 21:38:06 2015 UTC,"my case is fractal design define r5, and yeah i may buy 1x240 now for the cpu only loop and then add 360 or 420 after i buy the gpu block! what fans do you recommend? I was reading that the Phanteks PH-F140SP could be pretty decent if going for 140mm, what is good for 120mm?"
watercooling,34ec9l,enkil7412,1 point,Thu Apr 30 22:31:04 2015 UTC,I believe Phantek also release a 120mm version for static pressure.   I personally use AP15's (when they were still decently priced).  I've seen people use the EK Vardar series fans for their build.   I just find their noise very whiny compared to the GT series fans.
watercooling,34ec9l,beardedsavant,1 point,Fri May 1 00:07:49 2015 UTC,Will 2x 280mm ST30 alphacool rads be enough to cool 2x R9 290's and a i5-4690K? or should I definitely get at least one of them as a 45mm thick rad?
watercooling,34e4pd,bobthetrucker,3,Thu Apr 30 12:21:59 2015 UTC,You could contract this person. They seem to know what they're doing.

watercooling,34fc6i,Jamjar502,2,Thu Apr 30 17:55:43 2015 UTC,"If you use a 240mm radiator then it takes up the space of both cages. It might fit a 120mm radiator and one cage but I haven't done the math. Barely to the point that your setup might be louder than air cooling. You generally want 120mm per component and 240mm per component if you're overclocking. Yes, 420mm radiators are bigger and therefore should cool better. Just make sure you get some decent 140mm fans. The Phanteks SP140 fans are pretty decent according to this Overclock.net thread. Sorry, not that I'm aware of :-)"
watercooling,34fc6i,Jahara,1 point,Thu Apr 30 18:40:01 2015 UTC,"OK, so now I'm thinking of just having a 420mm rad on top and no other rad.   What is the general consensus when it comes to fans on rads? I was looking at Noctua's NF-F14 Industrial PPC fans, as I've used Noctua fans before and been very impressed with their performance, but I don't know what they're like on rads."
watercooling,34fc6i,Jahara,2,Thu Apr 30 19:05:45 2015 UTC,"Most people swear by Noctuas and for a good reason. The primary reason I went with Phanteks is that Noctuas are pretty expensive and I hate the way they look.  Also, something to consider is that you could just buy some 3.5"" -> 5.25"" adapters and stick your two hard drives into the drive bay so that you can get a larger radiator in the front."

watercooling,34fc6i,Nyxi26,1 point,Thu Apr 30 19:09:36 2015 UTC,they are both reference design with the same ek water block so they line up perfect just be sure u are well educated on your pcb design and figure it out from there use the cooling configurator on ekwb.com

watercooling,34fc6i,ConsiderItIlliterate,2,Sun May 3 21:44:45 2015 UTC,"Enthoo Pro owner here.   240/280mm no, 120/140mm possibly. It was VERY close when I measured. As in, certain brands will fit and others won't. You can however have a 240mm rad in the bottom (not front) of the case and keep the top HDD cage. General rule: 120mm per component + 120mm. Bearing in mind you can only fit a slimline rad up top, I'd recommend more than just a 360 for a 2 GPU+CPU loop. Yes. Be careful of width. I have a Hardwarelabs Black Ice Nemesis GTS which performs like a champ but required removing about 30mm from the top of both 5.25"" bays to fit.  Alphacool, but as above be careful of clearance. Those ports = wider/longer rad.   A note re 140mm rads - assuming identical fin density & width, a 140mm rad will have roughly 27% more surface area than it's 120mm counterpart. A 420mm will easily handle your components but I'd personally throw an extra rad in front for breathing room."

watercooling,34aqoy,RumCannonball,2,Wed Apr 29 21:30:23 2015 UTC,It looks like there is a missing screw.

watercooling,34aqoy,KallenStadtfeld_SC,2,Wed Apr 29 22:54:00 2015 UTC,It doesn't hurt the card at all as long as you're not bending it enough to pop parts off or touching something to short it out.
watercooling,34aqoy,Makirole,1 point,Wed Apr 29 22:56:49 2015 UTC,"It happens on a number of blocks/heatsinks.  Check out a side on picture of a windforce card, those can be pretty warped at times.  Not ideal, but not a card breaker either."

watercooling,34d58d,Rub_my_turkey,3,Thu Apr 30 04:45:57 2015 UTC,"Which motherboard were you planning on using?  The X99 mATX boards I know of only have two slots with decent spacing, the third being close to the others if present, so as you mentioned you'll have to cut one of the cards down to single slot.  I mean it's doable though, you've got the advantage that crossfire no longer uses an extra connector and does everything motherboard side.  Not having that extra connector would make things much neater as funnily enough people don't make ones with that sort of spacing, meaning you'd need a flexible one (ugly...).  As for the quick disconnects, easy enough.  Just add some bulkhead fittings to the rear side of the case and screw the QDCs into those, would look neat still and only take a few minutes.  Since you're putting a 360 up top I assume you're either using the extended S2.0 or asking them to whip you up something custom?"
watercooling,34d58d,Makirole,1 point,Thu Apr 30 09:24:47 2015 UTC,"I am probably going to ask them do do some custom work on it. The board I'm looking at is the Gigabyte x99M-Gaming5, which can do 16x/16x/8x."
watercooling,34d58d,Makirole,2,Thu Apr 30 14:40:50 2015 UTC,"Couple of things worth knowing in that case:   Parvum Systems are really busy right now.  Definitely get in contact with them, but you'll want to do so soon as it may take a while to get things cut.  If you're not building for a while it's not much of an issue. I built with one of those exact mobos not too long ago.  Solid board but the BIOS was awful, very laggy for some reason.  Changing the various OC and fan control options was a bit of a chore as a result."
watercooling,34d58d,Makirole,1 point,Thu Apr 30 15:34:54 2015 UTC,"I know, I have heard that Justin said he did want to do any custom cases for a while after he finished the case for Munney's build. I can fully understand seeing as that midwall res looked like a real chore. I would be purchasing my case this summer, so I think that waiting a bit is fine. Hopefully on the board they will fix the BIOS, I don't see why they wouldn't, but fan control is not really a big deal, I plan on using an Aquero for all of my fan and pump control needs."
watercooling,34d58d,xNPi,1 point,Thu Apr 30 16:06:01 2015 UTC,"I don't see why they wouldn't   It wouldn't surprise me if they didn't, it's not exactly a make or break thing.  I mean even with the issues it's still usable, just a bit frustrating.  It's not so much fan control which is an issue, more the whole user experience, which is a factor for overclocking.  But if you're the sort who sets a good clock then leaves it (I fall into that category) then it's a one time issue.  I think the lengthy bit with the custom work is the planning tbh, cutting the parts is fairly straightforward.  The issue with a case like Munney's is that it's very custom throughout, pretty much all the sides are a different size to the norm, as was the layout.  That's a lot of variables to consider really."

watercooling,34d58d,EntitledToLeave,2,Thu Apr 30 22:51:29 2015 UTC,"I think it's definitely doable, but you are probably going to have quite bad temperatures when you're running without that 4x180mm rad, if the 390x uses about the same power that the 290x uses."
watercooling,34bkxv,Kthwaits,4,Wed Apr 29 21:08:24 2015 UTC,"As others have said, go for the Titan X instead of the Z. Normally I would suggest you save your money and buy a lower wattage PSU but with a higher wattage one, the fan won't kick in as early. I would suggest this EVGA one over the Corsair one and put the $200 into more ram if you are going to be doing videos. Also Linus put a Rampage  V in a 450 (same internals as H440) you just cant use the grommets. Lastly, you could put a 280 instead of the 240 or dual 360s like this guy did, he uses one ST30 and one XT45."

Super sleek and it's not a matte finish, which I really liked since the matte scratches much easier.   I had a difficult time fitting multiple rads into the h440. In order to fit the 360 I have in the front, I had to remove the HDD cage, by drilling out the rivets. It wasn't hard to do, but I wasn't expecting to have to do it. Depending on the Mobo, there may also be trouble fitting the 240 in the back top two spaces because of clearance. The front most spot on the top is actually smaller than the back two, so it will take some modifications to make it fit there. Most sites have very accurate sizes for their products, so if your set on the H440 (I have 2 builds using them) then you may want to buy it first and measure before you purchase the rest."
watercooling,34bkxv,Zachariahmandosa,1 point,Wed Apr 29 21:35:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah the red and black one is actually the one I was looking at!

watercooling,34bkxv,Chessel,1 point,Wed Apr 29 22:04:26 2015 UTC,"Well, if you're going to a red/black theme, you could go for the slightly more expensive ASUS RoG Rampage V Extreme, which also has the USB 3.1 adapter, and faster read speeds, higher O.C. for RAM, etc. It's nice. It also comes with an overclock panel, which could be nice.  Like others have said here, I'd go with the Titan X over the Z, it's much better, and cheaper. However, if you have a little bit of patience, supposedly the 980 Ti is coming out next month, with the same number of CUDA cores as the Titan X but with 6GB of VRAM. If you SLI'd them, you'd have much better performance than the Titan X, and the price would probably be cheaper than the Titan Z.  And you could probably get away with running the AX1200i instead of the AX1500i, and save yourself over $100 that you wouldn't implement anyways. I doubt that system will have a power draw that high; even with all your components listed, it only comes to a 630 watt power draw.  Just my two cents. Nice build you have set up."
watercooling,34bkxv,Zachariahmandosa,1 point,Wed Apr 29 22:43:35 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the tips! Good call on the power supply, I'll change that. I was originally looking at the Rampage V Extreme but it turns out it actually is EATX form factor, which pcpartpicker claims is incompatible with the h440 ):   In regards to the 980 Ti, I was hoping to leave room for the possibility of an upgrade with another Titan x down the road, so I was trying to pick out the single best card possible for now so I can always toss in another a few years from now when my rig starts to struggle."
watercooling,34bkxv,Nyxi26,2,Wed Apr 29 23:00:56 2015 UTC,"Oh, didn't realize the H440 couldn't take EATX, that's a shame.   And SLI Titan X's would definitely be superior, damn. I wish I had the money to splurge on my build, but I'm still probably a year away from being able to go all-out.  My case can support EATX, but I can hardly fit any radiators in it at all, so I'm going with an external radiator I'll stand next to my case. It's a bit excessive, but makes things simpler for me. Ugly as fuck, but that's my aesthetic anyways."
watercooling,34bkxv,Nyxi26,1 point,Wed Apr 29 23:23:24 2015 UTC,"If you like the looks of the H440, I would recommend looking at NZXT's new case (Black+Red, based off of the H440 and Phantom series."

It has an assload of neat features that make me still love just checkin' it out, easy maintenance and whatnot.  Even though I can't fit radiators inside, I'm totally alright with a separate radiator. I'll have better cooling and a simpler loop using a single external radiator than several small ones inside. Transporting it will be more cumbersome, but then again if I have no-spill quick-disconnect compression fittings then I'm set.  Thanks for keeping an eye out, though."

watercooling,34bkxv,roarimadragon,2,Thu Apr 30 12:40:25 2015 UTC,"I'm going to repeat what I said above separately and recommend a better case. You've gone balls to the wall with components but chosen a somewhat mid-range case. You could go with a 750D, Enthoo Luxe/Primo, or even 900D and have far better watercooling options than the H440 offers.  The AX1500i is somewhat unnecessary for this build, the 1200w would be a better future-proofing choice (although under full load I doubt you'd hit even 850w).    You can also buy fully sleeved cable sets from Cablemod for those PSUs rather than having to get extensions!   Also, as people already mentioned, Titan X over Titan Z any day. Good luck with the build - it's gonna be awesome!  Edit: Wording."
watercooling,34bkxv,willdenham,2,Thu Apr 30 12:53:49 2015 UTC,"Thanks for taking the time to help me out, I appreciate it! Someone above also mentioned the AX1500i being overkill and you guys are definitely right, seems like 1200w is the way to go.   I had never heard of Cablemod but I just checked out some of their stuff and wow, those look great and will make a much better alternative to extensions.  As far as the case goes, I had no idea the H440 wasnt held in high esteem. After seeing so many builds on this sub with that case I had just assumed it was of pretty high quality. The main things that attracted me to it are the sound-dampening features, the simplistic look, as well as the fact its a mid-tower. Do you know of any mid-towers that you would recommend over the H440?"
watercooling,34corw,bkral93,1 point,Thu Apr 30 02:18:43 2015 UTC,"If you want a bay res, I reccomend the Koolance RP-452x2 and a D5 pump, seeing as you don't have a form factor constraint, and the D5 pump is much better than the ddc if you can fit it. If you live in the states, Performance-PCs is the way to go for watercooling. This is a nice photo for reference. http://cdn.overclock.net/a/ad/500x1000px-LL-ad63f59b_IMG_0006.jpeg"

I would not mount the rad on the top rad, usually its a bad idea to mount the pump so high up in the loop. This would be a decent option if you put a rad on the bottom with the fans underneat it  Don't know if you could re-use hardware with other manufacturers, but EK and EXPC both make pump/top/res combo devices that would save a lot of space.

watercooling,34aa9p,Zachariahmandosa,3,Wed Apr 29 15:30:46 2015 UTC,"I ran a Phobya 1080mm (9x120mm) external radiator in a rad box for about two years as I used a case that was very narrow and had no radiator mounting options without destroying its aesthetics.  It was very similar to the Watercool MO-RA3 9x120 LT Radiator you linked to.  The performance out of the one I had was amazing to be honest. It kept temperatures very low. The only reason I moved away from using it (although I still have it somewhere) is I switched cases to a 900D which has ample room for radiators.  I think an external radiator is a great idea if you're in a situation where you want maximum rad surface area possible or using a case with not very desirable or non-existent mounting points for radiators.  I have two pieces of advice, make sure you put dust filters on it, makes maintenance a lot easier, just like when you use filters on your case fans. And buy some quick-disconnects. I used Koolance QDC's but there is also Bitspower and a few other brands. Makes moving the case/radiator around much easier."
watercooling,34aa9p,i_mormon_stuff,2,Wed Apr 29 16:21:59 2015 UTC,I'm running a Phobya Supernova (9x140mm). The cooling power is superior. Drawbacks:   If you want to mount it the side of your tower it will tip over much easier since all the weight is on one side. It is horrible to transport.
watercooling,34aa9p,freewibblebon,2,Wed Apr 29 16:41:09 2015 UTC,"Before I built my '2D' wall-mount computer, I had all my parts in an open air bench case with all the water cooling parts in another external case sitting on a shelf above it.  The main downsides I ran into:   I had two lines with disconnects on each 'case' with the goal of being able to work on each side independently and easily.  After putting about $300 into quick-disconnects (Koolance and others), I never really found one that would not freely leak (when disconnected) after about 6-12 months of use.  The springs would get soft and not make a great seal.  End result, I had to drain everything whenever I wanted to work on anything anyway. The shear length of tubing (and fitting count) cut my flow to a point where I was not happy.  If pump noise was not an issue, I don't think you would have problem, but my D5 @10v got me only about 0.15 g/m. The tubing runs required to do external stuff can make draining or bubble removal a pain."
watercooling,34aa9p,reikes,2,Wed Apr 29 17:15:19 2015 UTC,Sure do!  http://i.imgur.com/8UVLtU1.jpg  Let me know if you have any questions! I'm constantly changing that setup but I'm overall happy with it.
watercooling,34aa9p,schwiing,2,Wed Apr 29 17:35:36 2015 UTC,What temperatures do you get with this cooler?   Why do you have it on top of that PC? That seems so dangerous.  Does it heat your room up immensely? Is it very loud?  And what kind of fans are those?
watercooling,34aa9p,schwiing,2,Wed Apr 29 18:19:58 2015 UTC,"1) Temperatures:  CPU (i7 3770k) @ 4.5Ghz idle @ 30C, load @ 45C GPUs (680 x2 in SLI) @ 1200/1800 Mhz idle @ 25C, load @ 33C   2) Placement:  Since my radiator is in a push/pull config, I need it to have unobstructed airflow on both sides of the radiator, which means it can't sit next to the PC case. Dangerous? It's not very heavy and the Fractal R4 case thats beneath it doesn't flex (not even a little bit) with that kind of weight on top. It's been in that config for a couple of years now.  3) Heat/Noise:  Heat, unfortunately yes. It's around 24-25C in that room whereas the rest of the house is 21-22C. But, I have a separate window air conditioner for when it gets too hot in that room, so that helps.  Noise? Although there's 8x180mm fans running on the radiator, they are very low speed fans (700rpm), so they are inaudible.  4) Fans:  Phobya G-silent Fans: link"
watercooling,34aa9p,schwiing,2,Wed Apr 29 19:58:39 2015 UTC,"Awesome, I was checking out Silverstone 700 rpm static pressure fans, which should (hopefully) be quiet as well as effective.  Do you think that a push or pull fan configuration would be enough to keep a system cool? I'm actually planning on using this on a hefty build, to cool a i7-5960X, ASUS Rampage V Extreme motherboard, and SLI'd 980 Ti, all of which will be overclocked. If I have to run a push/pull I would, but I'd rather just have a push configuration, honestly.   Also, another user said that dust filters would be a good idea? How long have you had yours, and what's the dust accumulation in it? Air dusting is not an issue, I'm just curious.  Also, how many pumps do you have in this set-up? Should I have a  pump below my reservoir, and then also near/at the radiator? Or would a single D5 be suitable for this?  Thanks for all the halp so far"
watercooling,34aa9p,RiffyDivine2,2,Wed Apr 29 20:24:32 2015 UTC,"Push OR Pull will be plenty sufficient. The Radiator is overkill to begin with so it's not going to make a huge difference. I have some data with 4 fans and 8 fans and it's hardly 1C different.   I have no filters. The fans are easy enough to dust out with my anti-static duster so I prefer that to reduced airflow with filters. Just my way of doing things  I have two pumps in series, mostly for redundancy. Yes, it does provide some extra head pressure, but the D5 at max flow rate really can handle my build on its own. I just prefer the redundancy."
watercooling,34aa9p,schwiing,1 point,Thu Apr 30 00:09:29 2015 UTC,What all did you use to build it? I do not want to give up the case I have and love but it's got so little room left inside so I am thinking I need to use an external setup if I want to switch to liquid.

watercooling,34aa9p,Vajz,2,Thu Apr 30 15:08:27 2015 UTC,I have the MO-RA3 mounted in a rack and cooling my machine.  It's an awesome beast.  I can't recommend it enough.  I haven't figured out fans for it (have just been running passive when it was cold outside) so I'll have to sort that out with the ambient getting higher.
watercooling,34aa9p,Vajz,2,Wed Apr 29 19:07:34 2015 UTC,"Just finished my build a few weeks ago.  Here's the thread.  And here's the gallery.  A few things that might be good to know:   If you go with the Mo-Ra, i can recommend the XSPC Photon D5 Res/Pump combo. It has a solid aluminium backplate which can be connected to a sidewall of the Radiator via 3M Dual Lock (a solid velcro kind of material). It dampens the pump vibration and offers an easy way of taking it apart for maintenance (pic in my gallery if you want to see what that looks like). Get quickconnects! They might be expensive (~15-20$ a piece if i remember correctly), but they're almost mandatory. Put 2 between the rad and the computer, so you can simply separate them without taking the whole loop apart. If you get quickconnects. Get the Koolance QD3s. QD4 are too big for almost every kind of watercooling application. The V-series is outdated and you need a twisting motion to separate/connect them. The QD Series only need a pulling/pushing motion. And get the uncolored (chrome) kind. The black ones have (had?) the issue of interacting with some coolants, discoloring and forming gunks."
watercooling,34aa9p,official_business,1 point,Thu Apr 30 06:42:45 2015 UTC,"Is your radiator passively cooled, or do you have fans?  You only have one D5 pump powering your parallel configuration; from my knowledge, parallel cooling offers better temps for each part, but has the downside of causing lower pressure in each part, due to the water being diverted. Do you find the single D5 to be sufficient? Is it loud/audible? Would you think it could support that radiator, a CPU, 2 GPUs and the motherboard as well?  And do you have the QD3s? I was planning on buying them, but am curious about how much they spill when opened; do you think the advertised amount of water released (0.2ml) is accurate? Also, are the black QD3s alright if I plan on using distilled water without any dye?  Thanks for the info"
watercooling,34aa9p,RiffyDivine2,2,Thu Apr 30 17:43:15 2015 UTC,"The fans are mounted in a pull configuration on the other side. 9x140mm. Honestly, it's kind of overkill.  In hindsight I'd rather have gotten the 420 than the 9x140 Mo-Ra so i could use 4x180 fans instead of 9x140. They're pretty quiet (Noiseblocker PK2), but still audible at ~6ft distance.  I can't confidently answer the question about pressure. I can only tell you that in my configuration, the cpu block has a higher flow restriction than the gpu block. When i was in the process of filling the loop it wouldn't circulate the cpu block at setting 1-2. Currently it's at 4 and it has no problems whatsoever. It could be that it's more difficult to circulate the loop when filling it, but I can't say for sure.  Is it sufficient for an additional gpu and mainboard block? Maybe. Can't say for sure.  I don't have a flow indicator or pressure gauge in my loop, so i can't tell you anything about flowrate or pressure of a D5@4 with 1 cpu and 1 gpu, just that it is working quite well (because my cpu is at a cool 30°C and isn't melting).  At setting 4 I can't hear the pump over the 9 radiator fans and 4 case fans. When I was leak testing the loop, I remember it being very quiet when you get all the air bubbles out.  As long as you have air bubbles in your pump/loop it's noisy as hell even at 2. I'm talking about ""wtf is this noise? is it broken?"" loud.  The quick disconnects in my build are the QD3s, yes. They're fresh out of the box and don't leak at all. I disconnected them and there wasn't even a single drop. Can't tell how much tension they'll lose over the course of their lifetime, but as of now they're really nice.  Apparently the black QD3s have an issue with copper sulfate (common corrosion inhibitor) + water + heat. Here's the link to the overclock.net forum discussion."

watercooling,34913z,Seatownflyer,1 point,Wed Apr 29 06:51:41 2015 UTC,"Tubing and fittings go hand in hand, so you pick what size you want and that goes across all of them.  Tubing and fittings have two measurements: Inner diameter and outer diameter AKA ID and OD. Most people seem to prefer a fairly thick wall that is not prone to kinking (folding over on itself) in bends. Because of this, two very popular sizes are 3/8""IDx5/8""OD and 1/2""IDx3/4""OD.  3/8""x5/8"" is probably the most popular because 1/2""x3/4"" is too big for some smaller cases, but people like the aesthetic of bigger tubing sometimes.  Fittings will need to be purchased around your tubing, so if you buy 3/8""IDx5/8""OD tubing you need to buy fittings of the same exact size. Compression fittings are probably some of the most popular fittings these days, but simple 3/8"" barb fittings could work if you want to save a couple of pennies.   Manufacturers of tubing and fittings is pretty much a personal preference area, or at least an aesthetic one as long as you're going with a reputable manufacturer.

watercooling,3486yb,ClaytronJames,3,Wed Apr 29 01:50:39 2015 UTC,"Thats perfectly fine as long as you remember to get fittings for the different sizes.    Alternatively, you could get a pump top for your pump to avoid being stuck with the stock barbs.  This way you can use whatever fittings and have more peace of mind if you use compression fittings."
watercooling,3486yb,nono0044,1 point,Wed Apr 29 02:35:39 2015 UTC,"Okay awesome, and yeah I was going to use compression fittings. Found a pump top on Amazon that looks like it fits my model of pump. Basically, if I understand correctly, a pump top would allow me to use a tube size of my choosing instead of the ID 1/2"" tube mandated by the manufacturer?"
watercooling,3486yb,nono0044,2,Wed Apr 29 05:42:17 2015 UTC,We could take a look to double check the compatibility of your pump and the top.  A pump top basically gives your several G1/4 ports that you can screw any type of fitting or extension into to use as inlets or outlets.  This way you aren't restricted to the location and size of the stock top's inlet and outlet.
watercooling,3486yb,nono0044,1 point,Wed Apr 29 12:34:30 2015 UTC,"Oh man if you could take a look just to verify I've got the right thing, that would be rad. My model is the MCP655-B and the Amazon page said that the top will fit any Swiftech in the 655 series"
watercooling,3486yb,nono0044,1 point,Wed Apr 29 17:12:27 2015 UTC,Should be okay.  Any variation of the D5 pumps should be able to take a D5 pump top regardless of manufacturer.  A link would be nice just to be 100% sure.

watercooling,347eqx,Silverrune1997,1 point,Tue Apr 28 22:24:10 2015 UTC,So are you asking if you should get a h220-x and change it to acrylic tubing?  Or getting parts and making an acrylic cpu only loop?
watercooling,347eqx,nono0044,1 point,Tue Apr 28 23:24:57 2015 UTC,I'm asking what parts I would need if I were change it to PETG. Even a 240 rad loop is more expensive then this.
watercooling,347eqx,nono0044,1 point,Wed Apr 29 03:24:27 2015 UTC,"You'd just need 4 fittings and the respective tubing.  2 for the cpu block and 2 for the pump and radiator (not 100% sure here, since the radiator is connected to the res and pump directly).  Best to have to more on hand just in case the res and radiator need to be separated.  If you want to do bends, then you'll need the silicone insert and a heat gun.  If not, you'll need angle adaptors."

watercooling,3470wt,PM_ME_YOUR_CHESTHAMS,1 point,Tue Apr 28 21:03:29 2015 UTC,I'll third that advice.  Just grab a high-end AIO cooler like the NZXT Kraken X61 280.  An AIO with a 240 or 280 rad will give you similar cooling performance to a CPU-only custom loop.
watercooling,3470wt,auApex,1 point,Wed Apr 29 02:12:17 2015 UTC,"If you're genuinely not bothered about watercooling your GPU, you're probably better off with an AIO. I used to have a CM Nepton 280l in my Enthoo Pro and it performs really well."

watercooling,34358l,Andrej_ID,2,Tue Apr 28 18:21:45 2015 UTC,Seeing as the only color in your build are those corsair fans which can be painted I would say something like pastel white or maybe a transparent purple if you are into that.
watercooling,34358l,SpringerTheNerd,2,Tue Apr 28 18:58:25 2015 UTC,Damn nice build! Why did you go for two reservoirs though?
watercooling,34358l,mastermikeee,1 point,Mon Apr 27 23:38:19 2015 UTC,Probably dual loops. GPUs are for the lower cage radiators and CPU is the upper one. Just my guess.

watercooling,345gne,ChocolateBubbles17,2,Tue Apr 28 13:30:16 2015 UTC,"I want to watercool my Corsair 250D build, GPU and CPU. Because of space I plan on using the Eisberg Solo, Alphacool G2 Slim 240 rad and Nexxus GPX R9 290 M02 GPU block as I have an MSI Gaming R9 290. Should I go all custom, or get the Eisberg 240 kit along with more tubing and fittings. Its roughly the same price for both options."
watercooling,345gne,freewibblebon,2,Tue Apr 28 17:03:46 2015 UTC,"Using the Eisberg is an extremely bad idea. The thing already has low pressure and flowrates, even with the ""high speed edition"". Adding the GPU Block will not help with that. You might end up having too low flow.  Also you don't have enough rad space. Your graphics card is 300 watts so should have at least a 360 or if your CPU is powerfull as well a 480. Otherwise watercooling will have no benefit over aircooling as you will have to crank all fans up and still have hot temps."
watercooling,345gne,ChocolateBubbles17,2,Tue Apr 28 20:02:25 2015 UTC,"Thank you very much! I have a 4690K, but it's an ITX case, and there's no way I could fit a 360. Could I do a 240 and a seperate 140/200 rad in the front? What cheap pump would you recommend then?"
watercooling,345gne,freewibblebon,2,Wed Apr 29 06:52:59 2015 UTC,"It doesn't have to be one rad. Just make sure you get enough surface area to efficiently cool your hardware.  If you want a ""cheap"" pump I'd go with a laing ddc. But then again: Watercooling is an expensive hobby, if you want something cheap and reliable go with aircooling. Custom loops are pricy."
watercooling,345gne,ChocolateBubbles17,2,Wed Apr 29 15:35:24 2015 UTC,"Do you have any opinion on the XSPC x2O 420 single bay? I really am short on space so combo units are important.

watercooling,345gne,freewibblebon,2,Wed Apr 29 18:58:22 2015 UTC,"I don't know the pump. But according to the manufacturers data and this review it is absolutely fine, eventhough a little noisy.  Two other suggestions for you to consider: - Microres with a Laing DDC would be even smaller than the bayres-pump-combo and would allow further future customization. -There are all in one solutions for both CPU and GPU. You can also go with one independend cooling system for each.  Best luck and have fun with this project :)"

watercooling,3423sh,DickamusMaxamus,4,Mon Apr 27 18:29:28 2015 UTC,"Does this build look weird as hell?    Because it should.   This system has been a constant work since I was in highschool, as most are.  Now that I've graduated from college and have a full time job, I've got a little cash to throw at it.  I pulled the mobo/RAM/CPU combo out of my old build in a Silverstone FT03, hence the MicroATX mobo.    I'm running a little Aquaero hardware in the setup, with the Aquaero 6 XT controller, paired with the Aquaero Ultra pump.  The water temp sensor is in the mail, and will be used to help control the 12 Gentle Typhoon fans (6 on the 3 fan rads in the front and the back of the case, and 3 pulling exhaust at the top of either end) in the build.   The 970 was purchased at a time when I was thinking I may not be watercooling.  Because of that, I bought a non-reference 970, and unfortunately can't watercool this unit, because no block exists for it. I'll be replacing it with a reference 980 and a block in the near future.   The build is far from perfect, and there's quite a bit that I'm going to be changing up as money rolls in. This is a picture of it lit up.  The sticker has been on every build I've owned since highschool, so I HAD to throw it on the new one :)  http://i.imgur.com/rX9gGvc.jpg  Let me know what you think!"
watercooling,3423sh,Denseflea,2,Mon Apr 27 18:38:34 2015 UTC,"The build looks a bit weird but solid. I would just hope that the pump at the top doesn't leak, as it will run all the way down your mobo.  The potential looks like it's there though."
watercooling,3423sh,Denseflea,1 point,Mon Apr 27 18:54:44 2015 UTC,"Because I'm choosing to keep my radiators at the bottom of the build, this is kinda where the res (that's what I'm assuming your referring to by pump) has to sit, in order to keep it high enough above the pump."
watercooling,3423sh,eQuiFY,1 point,Mon Apr 27 19:04:34 2015 UTC,Oh yeah I thought that was your water loop pump. Cool looking reservoir. Any particular reason why you wouldn't keep the res at the bottom and the radiator at the top?
watercooling,3423sh,eQuiFY,2,Mon Apr 27 19:09:56 2015 UTC,"I want to have both radiators at the bottom so they weren't bringing in air that had already been cycled through the system.  It's the most natural way to have the system in this case setup, in regards to convection.   I think what you're seeing is the fill portion, which is the bit of tubing that goes up out of the res."

watercooling,3423sh,Kautkto,3,Mon Apr 27 18:51:14 2015 UTC,"It's freaking brilliant.  Totally quiet, and I can monitor EVERYTHING about it through the software in the Aquaero.  Currently I've got a custom fan curve setup to monitor the system, and have it react automatically based on certain criteria.  When the system's water is in the 30's, the top fans aren't running.  Once the system water hits 40c, the exhaust fans kick in to about 400RPM, and the radiator fans spin up to about 800RPM, and so on.  The whole build (sans the GPU) is almost totally silent.   If the pump were to die, I would know immediately, as the software running on my third monitor would let me know right away."

watercooling,3423sh,philter,2,Mon Apr 27 19:57:33 2015 UTC,"I should also mention that the Aquaero stuff isn't even that terribly expensive.  The pump was about $110ishly, which is a bit more than than an average pump, but it isn't crazy.  The Aquaero 6XT was about $220, which seems hard to justify until you have it in your hands, and you can play around with the software."
watercooling,3423sh,Makirole,1 point,Mon Apr 27 20:57:08 2015 UTC,"Not to mention there are cheaper aquaero controllers out there (5XT for $149, 5LT for $69 (Internal, no screen)).  To the OP. I'd get some bitspower angled rotary fittings in your loop, especially for that horrid curve on the pump-CPU tubing. At the least I'd twist the pump around by 90 degrees so the tube can point more efficiently at the cpu block."

How are your temps with a single rad? I haven't seen either of those external rad/fitting suggestions before, but tbh I'm intrigued. My plan includes a 140 and I was hoping for a 120 where yours is, but I wasn't sure how to squeeze it. (PSU conflict). My other option is using a 90mm, but I feel like thats almost a wasted effort.

watercooling,343dmm,JJAsond,1 point,Tue Apr 28 00:00:35 2015 UTC,"Tubing is all looks. If you're looking for easy plug and play get soft tubing. Size really doesn't matter too much so go for what you think will look good. Get matching fittings for your tubing and you will be set. The soft tubing we always recommend is primochill advanced LRT.   It's not impossible to start with hard tubing be we tend to push people towards soft tubing unless they are really determined.   As for color, thats up to you. If you get clear tubing with colored coolant it will stain over time but only the tubing. The dyes won't effect performance and wont permanently stain your blocks. You can easily clean them at any time."
watercooling,343dmm,niceandcreamy,1 point,Tue Apr 28 00:56:31 2015 UTC,"Just adding.  With hard tubing, you can get a bit more precise with the runs as you can bend tubing to go exactly where you need it.  Not that its really a huge issue these days, but hard tubing is also plasticizer free."

Another possible way, change the orientation of the radiator so the ports are on the bottom and go: GPU bridge -> CPU block -> through the top rubber grommets to the pump -> through the bottom rubber grommet to the radiator -> GPU bridge."

watercooling,343yng,nono0044,2,Tue Apr 28 03:20:57 2015 UTC,Flow direction doesn't matter and as far as I know rad placement shouldn't either. If it does it would only be like a degree or 2 difference. I have a 480mm after my cpu and a 480 mm after my gpus
watercooling,343yng,metallives,2,Tue Apr 28 03:21:41 2015 UTC,I should add that flow direction doesn't matter as long as your blocks don't have jet plates in them if they do just look at the directions and it will tell you which side is the inlet and outlet
watercooling,343yng,metallives,2,Tue Apr 28 03:22:30 2015 UTC,"Coolant temperature rarely differs by more than a degree or so in the loop, so agonising about where the radiator is placed is pretty pointless. Direction matters on some CPU. Usually the water goes in more or less centrally over the CPU block, and then out towards the side (assuming you have a block where direction matters)."

Remove plug, add barbed fitting with a short section of hose, clamp hose. Flip case over, unclamp hose, crack a plug up high for pressure release, and drain.

watercooling,33zxjx,Zachariahmandosa,9,Mon Apr 27 04:54:17 2015 UTC,You should never cool your water below room temp as condensation will occur and water dripping on your parts will kill your rig a whole lot faster than high temps.
watercooling,33zxjx,scarypandabear,6,Mon Apr 27 06:01:42 2015 UTC,Or you must account for condensation in some fashion.
watercooling,33zxjx,rreyv,-1,Mon Apr 27 06:12:38 2015 UTC,"Room temperature as in 72 degrees Fahrenheit, the condensation point of water? That shouldn't be too difficult, the chillers I've been looking at all have fine temperature control"
watercooling,33zxjx,i_mormon_stuff,6,Mon Apr 27 10:23:58 2015 UTC,You're forgetting that inside the computer case it will be essentially a very small room itself with a much higher temperature than the actual room the PC is in.  This can create condensation on the tubes inside the case.
watercooling,33zxjx,rreyv,3,Mon Apr 27 10:45:35 2015 UTC,There is no 'condensation' point of water. Droplets condense on cooler surfaces as compared to the surroundings. There is more condensation when either 1. Humidity is high or 2. The temperature difference is bigger.
watercooling,33zxjx,SeaJayCJ,1 point,Mon Apr 27 14:45:58 2015 UTC,"If I was going to do something like this I would set up a microcontroller (an Arduino would work) to measure the coldest water in the loop (coming out of the chiller) and adjust the power of the chiller to maintain a temperature at least 10 degrees above ambient. If the chiller didn't have any kind of fine control (just on and off), I'd have a stair step at 40-50C or something.   I'd also insulate the shit out of my motherboard and have my power supply fan pointing down, just in case (similar to what people do with phase change coolers, DICE and LN2)"
watercooling,33zxjx,official_business,1 point,Mon Apr 27 06:42:55 2015 UTC,"I've seen projects like this actually.  There's definitely buildlogs on the net about it.  I guess it depends what your goals are.  Is there a specific temperature you need to hit to make a certain overclock?  Here's where I become a Debbie Downer.  An aquarium chilled system would be more expensive, complicated and power hungry than a standard WC loop, for what is essentially no benefit.  Your average chiller will use as much if not more power than the PC itself. (not to mention condensation problems pointed out by /u/scarypandabear, you'd need to insulate your tubing)  Your CPU and GPU can happily chug along at 80c all day long.  Under a standard WC setup you'll never get that hot anyway (unless you don't have enough radiator) and your pump would fail long before as they are generally limited to pumping coolant no hotter than 60c. (for the D5, anyway).  Realistically you'll never generate enough heat to warrant it.  If you're running standard clock speeds (or a mild OC) there's no reason to do it."
watercooling,33zxjx,Skulder,-3,Mon Apr 27 09:17:23 2015 UTC,"No experience, just thoughts.  Chillers are about ten percent effective (yeah, I pulled that number from my ass, but it's not that wrong).  So let's say you have a 500W pc. You'd need to use 5kW of cooling. That's a damn lot.  Think carefully about this - do you need to cool your PC components to a lower degree than ambient temperature?  If ambient temperature is good enough for you, better air-cooling and higher water-flow will help you approach that - and that's much less costly."
watercooling,33zxjx,metallives,-2,Mon Apr 27 08:08:42 2015 UTC,you could overvolt your cpu and gpus and mobo so that way it would burn off the condensation before it became a problem.  but then you could probably expect the top of your case to become something like a sauna. but hey at least your components would be cool
watercooling,33zxjx,conet,2,Mon Apr 27 13:18:20 2015 UTC,"Seems like a reasonable solution, offset the condensation caused by the water cooling loop by heating the things being cooled by a couple thousand degrees.

I'm really looking to keep all fans <800-900RPM for ""silence"", so I was thinking more rad space the quieter it will be because I'll run the fans that much slower.   I'm cooling a 5820k that's overclocked to 4.7GHz and a Titan X that I will be overclocking heavily once its under water.

These numbers are sort of a minimum rather than a 'safety average'. I'd even go as far as to add 120mm rad or even 240 mm rad on any of the examples above for a good safety cooling margin (hot days or high continuous loads)."

Then the flow should go from the pump to the bottom radiator on the bottom then continue as you designed in the mock up.  Then you will go into that front radiator before returning to the res.

watercooling,33ztqs,qweasdzxc132,2,Mon Apr 27 04:12:52 2015 UTC,"alphacool rads are great and so are the black ice rads the general rule of thumb is 120mms of rad space per component that you want to cool, so for a cpu and 2 gpus 360mms of rad space should be enough but theres no such thing as too much rad space so 2 360mms should be enough   3.a male fitting has a protrusion sticking out a female fitting has a hole. the male fitting goes into the female fitting just like in real life. quick disconnects stop the water flow so you can remove tubing or access individual parts of the water loop without getting water all over.  basically the male fitting fits into the female fittings and then you turn them together to stop the water flow."
watercooling,33ztqs,metallives,1 point,Mon Apr 27 13:13:46 2015 UTC,"Most people regard the Hardware Labs Black Ice series as the best rads out there independent of size.  You want at least 120mm of radiator space per component plus an additional 120+ for overhead, in your situation at least a 360 and a 120 but a 360 and 240 or even two 360s would not be a bad idea to keep temps low and run fans quietly.  For quick disconnects you have to buy a male and a female for each connection you are making. They are 3-4 times the cost of regular compression fittings and barbs because of this."

watercooling,33zrq6,niceandcreamy,1 point,Mon Apr 27 04:19:39 2015 UTC,To be honest using a 180mm radiator with a high fin density with a really good fan will net you a better performance than a 200mm one. There aren't really any good 200mm static pressure fans so you'll get pretty poor performance.

To answer your question, generally the kind of screws you'd use would consist of a screwhead, about 25mm of smooth rod, then a few mm of thread. Kind of like this. You insert the screws into the top of the case, through the fan holes, then into the rad's mounting holes."

watercooling,33urg5,Herrowgayboi,2,Sat Apr 25 20:42:07 2015 UTC,It's a good value kit and save a few bucks over buying individually but the EX series radiators are not the great of performers.  Most of the major brands have kits that include a D5 and a 240mm rad.  Alphacool has a very nice kit that is available in a thin radiator if you need one (NexXxoS Cool Answer 120 D5/ST).  Link to Alphacool NexXxoS Cool Answer 120 D5/ST
watercooling,33urg5,cvance10,1 point,Sat Apr 25 21:14:39 2015 UTC,"What makes the EX series not great? How about the RX and AX series? As for the Alphacool, I was looking at that but what turned me off is that you can never get the res 100% full, and the fill port is small according to youtube videos."
watercooling,33urg5,RagnarKon,3,Sat Apr 25 22:16:12 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure if this is what /u/cvance10 was talking about... but the EX series is a thinner radiator.  Thinner radiators obviously have less surface area for heat dissipation, which is why the EX radiators don't perform as well as thicker radiators.    Anyway, I have the D5 / EX280 kit running in my current build.  All of my previous radiators were too big to fit inside my new (at the time) Fractal Design R4 case.  So I needed a thinner radiator and XSPC was the choice.  My general impression?  The kit itself is a great kit, and all of the components work well.  The instructions aren't quite as clear as other water cooling manufacturers, but water cooling really always has been a ""experienced users only.""  If you can't decipher less-than-flawless instructions, then maybe you shouldn't be water cooling to begin with.

For example, alphacool's 280mm 45mm thick rad wont fit up top without having issues with the mobo, as far as I can tell. It also barely fits in the front (I had to...cut away some metal in the 5.25 cage up top because of alphacool's multiple ports). I'm using a 30mm thick rad up top instead.  As for mounting my res/pump (which is a D5+140mm res combo from EK), I'm using this bracket to mount it to the front radiator.  Finally, if you look at the 450D's holes for cabling to the mobo, it has two vertical ones, which might not allow for pretty 24-pin atx cable placement.

We don't really give parts lists because:  A) Everyone has different needs, wants, and budgets, so its hard to know what you want for yourself.  B) Makes people lazy and clutters up the sub.  If we were to just give you a parts list, there wouldn't be a good learning process.  You wouldn't know as much as to why these parts were chosen and you wouldn't be familiar with them if you had to fiddle with your loop.  Also, it would be quite annoying if everyone just came here to ask for a partslist and just bounced too, less discussion and stuff made.  So that being said, there's lots of info on the sidebar to help you get a good idea of what you'll need and why.  As for brands, depends on your budget and each brand does certain things better.  Bitspower is probably the best for fittings in terms of quality and selection, but that comes at a high $$$.   EK has okay fittings, people have had issues with them before.  They do however have the best selection for waterblocks, both for CPUs and GPUs.  XSPC is slightly more budget friendly, offering options at different price ranges.  I don't really like their blocks as they look cheap, and they tend to try to slap their logo all over their fittings.  Primochill is more for tubing and watercooling extras.

As for watercooling. I'd go with EK CPU/GPU blocks, Bitspower fittings, DDC or D5 pump, and alphacool/Hardware Labs/XSPC radiators.  Avoid aluminum.

watercooling,33ncec,fikshunn,2,Fri Apr 24 01:19:23 2015 UTC,Is there any issue running a coil in my build with the nickel? Great idea with the drain. I'lol be posting lots of pics when it's done
watercooling,33ncec,Alestor,3,Fri Apr 24 04:11:06 2015 UTC,"Yes, don't run a kill coil with nickle it'll eat through it. Get some ethylene glycol based biocide and mix it with distilled to make cheap coolant. I'm starting to feel like I'm advertising the stuff, buf Dazmode Protector is what I'm going with"
watercooling,33ncec,Alestor,2,Fri Apr 24 07:24:51 2015 UTC,"This is exactly what I was looking for. Thanks for the heads up /u/Alestor . The only other question I have is about color. If I wanted to have a clear red fluid, would food coloring still be my best bet and is it safe to mix with the Dazmode Protector?"
watercooling,33ncec,Alestor,2,Fri Apr 24 17:12:29 2015 UTC,"Food coloring isn't a good idea since its sugar based and will feed algae, though it might be fine with enough biocide I wouldn't risk it. You'd be better off looking for coolant dye, I'm personally going with red tubing and clear distilled so I havn't researched too much about dyes, so do some googling to find what has a good reception and didn't gunk up anyone's system. If you ever want to change colors, dye can be a nightmare to clean off I've heard"
watercooling,33ncec,freewibblebon,2,Fri Apr 24 17:30:49 2015 UTC,"Oh wow, I  had no idea about the algae feeding. I'll check out the coolant dyes. Do you know if there are any that shouldn't be combined? I'm also not too worried about color swapping, since the build is red/black with white accents. On a semi related note, the GPU I picked up was used with 100% Koolance LIQ-705 Liquid Coolant. There shouldn't be any issues with coolant contamination as long as I flush everything out a couple of times, right?"
watercooling,33ncec,fikshunn,1 point,Fri Apr 24 22:12:32 2015 UTC,"Just gunna say again that I personally don't plan to use dyes in my loop so I haven't researched it too much, just know that I may be off the mark with some of this stuff. You probably shouldn't mix dyes (though you shouldn't need to if you just want red, just buy red dye) though I don't think they'll cause problems. Look up reviews for the best coolant dyes and make sure there are no reported problems with it, there are some that will gunk up easily and be a nightmare to clean. Personally I'm staying away from it for peace of mind and just going colored tubing  As long as you thouroughly clean the block it shouldn't cause problems, especially if it was a clear coolant you'll be fine just flushing it a couple times. If it was a dyed coolant you may want to open up the block and give it a thorough cleaning to make sure theres no remaining bits that may leech into the water"

watercooling,33mpj8,Jfsanta,2,Thu Apr 23 19:47:29 2015 UTC,also upgrading to watercooling will not reduce the heat coming out of your case as water carry's more heat away from your components
watercooling,33mpj8,metallives,2,Fri Apr 24 00:07:34 2015 UTC,So water cooling is more for the cool factor?
watercooling,33mpj8,metallives,1 point,Fri Apr 24 00:39:41 2015 UTC,It is cool but it also cools better. But I mean if you want less hot air coming out of your pc watercooling will not do that. It will dissipate the heat better but that heat has to go somewhere.
watercooling,33mpj8,TinyRumchata,1 point,Fri Apr 24 01:24:49 2015 UTC,"Watercooling is more efficient at transferring heat than air cooling.   Your system will still radiate the same amount of heat,  but you will see that your system temps.  This drop is due to water's efficiency at transferring the heat from your system generates into the water cooling system. Then the radiator will transfer that heat into the air.   A water cooling radiator works very similar to a typical air cooler. Air passes over the fins on the radiator and the heat is then transfered into the air."
watercooling,33mpj8,official_business,1 point,Fri Apr 24 15:03:47 2015 UTC,"Your question is pretty open ended.  I'd suggest reading some watercooling tutorials or watching some videos on youtube.  JayzTwoCents and Dazmode have good videos, but there's plenty of others around.  Also make sure to check out the links in the sidebar.  Do some googling on your chosen case + watercooling to see what others did.  It may be that you can't fit a radiator & pump inside the case.  Seeing other's builds helps to show what is and isn't possible.  Essentially, what you will need is:     CPU Block GPU Block Radiator Fittings (barbs or compression) Pump Fans Coolant Tubing   For coolant I use distilled water.  So long as your loop is only copper and nickel you won't get corrosion.  For fans I have 4 wire PWM fans that are speed controlled.  As the system gets hotter they spin faster.  This makes it quiet when it's idle and can spin faster when the system gets warmer."

watercooling,33kefe,Born_To_Roam,1 point,Fri Apr 24 08:15:35 2015 UTC,"If you're going to watercool this is probably the best case for it.  Offers tons of possibilities and a good price.  Downside of this is they had to cut corners to hit that price point.  The side panels don't line up perfectly and the top panel is curved.  The harddrive bays are the dumbest design and take up way to much space.  Tt only includes 2 fan/radiator mounts so if you want 2 rads up top and a third on the side you cant.  I still really like the case, but its not the same quality as corsair or phanteks"

watercooling,33ntqv,RichP23,5,Fri Apr 24 01:12:00 2015 UTC,"Before numbered questions, watercooling 101 is always have your pump fed by your res. The res is meant to make sure the pump never runs out of water/coolant which lubricates it, without it it'll quickly get damaged. Also, I don't know what voltage you're running that CPU on, but keep in mind that running crazy high voltages is going to reduce the life of the CPU even if you can keep it cool.   Put the drain valve at the lowest part of the loop, you'd need a T-Block and either a valve or a stop plug or a quick disconnect. Make it so when you turn the valve/unscrew the plug/attach the QDC all or majority of the water will naturally flow to it. If there are some tubing runs which won't naturally drain to the bottom you may need to tilt the case or consider a secondary drain. As long as you have fans rated with high static pressure you'll be fine. I have no experience with gentle typhoons but I hear they're the best there is for radiators. PWM means that the fan has 4 pins rather than 3 and can be controlled via software. A non-PWM fan will only run at rated speeds unless you use a voltage step down using a resistor or a fan controller, while a PWM fan can go at whatever speed you want assuming you have it connected to a 4 pin motherboard/controller header My case came with a built in fan controller and I feel like they're worth it, though only if you go non-PWM or want to hide away your wires without emerging to reach the motherboard. They let you manage fan speeds which will lower cooling performance and noise, so turn up the fans when things get hot, and turn them down when idling so they aren't making a racket. Though if you're motherboard has enough fan headers for every fan in your case and you don't mind cable managing them you don't need a controller since you can control them in software. No knowledge of universal blocks other than that they only cover the processor on the card, so keep that mosfet cooling in mind. You might be better off just leaving the stock coolers on there and sticking with a cpu only loop   Also make sure everything fits in you're case, those rads are monsters. And keep in mind that thickness of rads don't net you as much performance as you might expect but might require a push or push/pull setup to get air through efficiently. You likely have more rad space than you strictly need too since general rule of thumb is 1 rad fan space per component, though this is coming from someone about to put 4 fan spaces in a 1 cpu 1 gpu loop  A loop layout would help people here judge your runs as well, so take a picture of your case and drop it in paint to give us some ideas as to what you're planning"
watercooling,33ntqv,Alestor,1 point,Fri Apr 24 07:14:40 2015 UTC,"Thanks so much for taking the time to write that up.   For the flow, I'll work on the loop layout diagram tomorrow laying out the components and flow. I need to do that anyway to determine what angle fittings I may need to get.   What you wrote about fans and PWM is definitely helpful. I'll have to look at my board and case and think about which direction I want to go in.  I know those rads fit in the case since many others have used the same in the Enthoo Primo. I wanted to go with 2 rads for two reasons:    I had wanted to include the GPUs, which would mean 3 components plus I read you should have 1 extra, which would be 4 rad spaces. The above would yield 5 rad spaces It looks cool.    Also, I planned on going with the thicker rads since I knew I wanted to run push/pull on both of them."
watercooling,33ntqv,Alestor,1 point,Fri Apr 24 14:52:16 2015 UTC,"Just finished my first attempt at a loop layout. http://imgur.com/e3kiMpF  Now the order goes:  Res > Pump > Bot Rad > GPU > GPU > CPU > Top Rad  Also today I was looking at the EK-BAY Reservoir. I know there are drawbacks to going with a bay res, but it would keep a lot of the tubing to the right side of the case and fairly hidden. Plus it looks kinda cool and can fill easily by taking off the top mesh filter on the case."
watercooling,33ntqv,Nyxi26,1 point,Sun Apr 26 04:32:32 2015 UTC,"That layout seems fine to me, the res is above the pump so the water will spill into it naturally. I think the Monsta rad has a drain port on the end so I'd suggest attaching your drain there since its the lowest part of the loop, though it may be hard to place it if there isn't enough clearance with the back of the case.   The connection to the bottom rad from the pump is probably going to be a water trap so you may want to put a secondary drain on the pump, though that could be solved by flipping the case on its back to empty it into the rad if you don't want to waste money on that. Alternatively you could get a pump/res combo and avoid that run altogether so that it all naturally drains at once, though keep space in mind since attaching the pump obviously makes the res take more space.  I haven't done much research into bay reservoirs. I'm pretty sure I've seen people kind of apprehensive about them though I can't remember specifics. I'm sure it would be fine if that's the way you want to go though"
watercooling,33ntqv,Nyxi26,2,Sun Apr 26 05:28:13 2015 UTC,"Just going to weigh in on the fan controller point.    The Enthoo Primo has a PWM fan hub built in to the case. You can run up to 11 fans from one PWM header on your mobo dependant on wattage and using splitters. The mobo also has Asus' UEFI BIOS and FanXpert which will allow you to set up custom fan profiles and custom curves for each header in the BIOS (assuming it's up-to-date).   Tl;dr, you don't need to buy a fan controller as your case & mobo already have the tech to manage that for you better than most aftermarket fan controllers can."

Regardless the biggest issue you are going to face is places for a radiator in that case. Most of the time just a 120mm AIO solution like the Seidon 120 are about the only things that fit in there. It would be really a waste of money to make a custom loop just for the CPU for a single 120mm radiator when you can get really good AIOs for much much cheaper. Even aircooling might be better in that respect.  Unfortunately, watercooling is really limited by the case. You need radiator space in order to get better cooling.

Having two different types of fans on the top radiator will actually hinder you performance as they will be competing with each other.  just ditch the 'Gigant Fan'  Radiator 2 will not give any noticeable benefit to the cooling of the system. I would just ditch it and have a fan there instead.

Your cpu will run the same at 20 degrees at it will at 25 degrees and same with the gpus.  Also I never said watercooling was cheep I simply said that distilled water is cheaper than coolant. it is not safer as with pure distilled water all you have to do is use a silver coil or a anti algae agent with coolant you have to worry about everything.  Biocide and antifungal. Sure it looks ok but you can get the same look with colored tubing and a bit of research
watercooling,33kqmi,Kautkto,1 point,Fri Apr 24 01:37:28 2015 UTC,Kill coils don't stop algae. Unfortunately.   For 5 or 6 years you were asking a lot of newbish questions 11 months ago...
watercooling,33kqmi,metallives,1 point,Fri Apr 24 02:46:19 2015 UTC,I didn't say kill coils stopped algae.  That why I also added an anti fungal or a few drops of copper sulfate
watercooling,33kqmi,Kautkto,1 point,Fri Apr 24 07:29:28 2015 UTC,Yes you did. Unless I misinterpreted your use of 'or'.. And you ignored my other question..
watercooling,33kqmi,metallives,1 point,Fri Apr 24 08:11:41 2015 UTC,Yes a silver coil or an anti algae agent because algae doesn't just grow. if you do some research you will find that algae needs certain Conditions to grow. You wouldn't be able to just use an anti algae agent but you could use just a kill coil.  Also you didn't have another question
watercooling,33i1t4,fluxmaven,2,Wed Apr 22 18:11:29 2015 UTC,Nice you finnally got it up and running! And I like what you did to it taking the extra acrylic off of it. Congrats in finnally finishing it.
watercooling,33i1t4,jesus0nadinosaur,2,Wed Apr 22 18:23:24 2015 UTC,"Yea, it wouldn't have fit in the 5.25 bay due to me having to bend the support up to fit the radiator. Plus It looks cooler this way IMO. I had plenty of setbacks with other life issues, and parts for this. That rad uses G3/8 instead of the normal G1/4... But now it works and it runs cool and quiet. Thanks to the $1.23 purple LED strip my wife thinks it's cool so she's not upset that I spent lots of money lol.  Thanks for being my first HWS trade!"
watercooling,33i1t4,jesus0nadinosaur,2,Wed Apr 22 18:34:44 2015 UTC,No problem my friend I'm glad I finnally got to see it complete and working. I love it when I see stuff I sell bieng put to good use! And that's really strange about the rad and fittings I've litterally never ever seen that.

watercooling,33i1t4,Dalantech,1 point,Thu Apr 23 11:01:51 2015 UTC,Thank you! I wanted it to be different and I liked how simple the front of the case is so moving the fan controller and pump to the hard drive cage kept it clean and simple. Next I plan to clean up the wiring a bit and make a black shroud for the bluray drive because at certain angles the glare from the LEDs is annoying.

watercooling,33j6cf,metallives,1 point,Thu Apr 23 12:51:26 2015 UTC,Stock cooler will be sufficient in the meantime. It runs hit under benchmarks but not real world usage. If you notice an issue a few weeks down the track you can always get an aftermarket cooler then.

watercooling,33j6cf,metallives,1 point,Fri Apr 24 07:24:14 2015 UTC,GPS backplates help with cooling and also aesthetics. Ek aren't necessarily the best in the market.   Distilled water and a killcoil is a bad idea with nickel plating.
watercooling,33j6cf,metallives,1 point,Thu Apr 23 10:48:02 2015 UTC,it has been proven that gpu backplate do nothing except help with looks. If you look at the data for gpus with andwithout backplate there is no difference at load.  Ek absolutely are the best in the market. And anyone would agree. Go with distilled water and a biocide agent if you have nickle blocks. Or distilled water and a few drops of copper sulphate
watercooling,33j6cf,Kautkto,1 point,Thu Apr 23 11:31:12 2015 UTC,"To be fair, the main reason I'm looking at liquid cooling is because it looks cool. Air cooling would be fine on my build, but this sounds like way more fun!  EDIT: I forgot to add this, but EVERYTHING is from EK, I just didn't type out the full names. I've heard they're the best, and I think it looks awesome too."
watercooling,33j6cf,metallives,0,Thu Apr 23 12:58:34 2015 UTC,"i mean i have a full watercooled setup and i dont use backplates but its personal preference.  if you have the 60 extra dollars to blow on backplates go for it personally i would take the 60$ and put it toward something else.  ek makes the best blocks.  personally i only use bitspower compression fittings, but im sure the ek ones work just as well. i also only use alphacool rads but im sure the ek ones work great that pump res combo is amazing. all of their xres pump res combos are amazing keep in mind with nickle blocks that you will need a biocide agent as well as an anti algae agent dont go with a kill coil"

watercooling,33gw39,Lyianx,2,Wed Apr 22 18:01:37 2015 UTC,"You can definitely do this, but you would have to flip the CPU block so that the IN port is closest to the radiator, then the OUT to the res/pump. Still, you have a run across most of the motherboard."

watercooling,33dad3,erickliban,1 point,Tue Apr 21 19:08:11 2015 UTC,"The thing is, the price of a new card + another waterblock is going to be more than finding something that works.

I'm doing this for the fun of it as well as silencing the beast and so buying a new card is sortof against the point of seeing what i can do with the equipment i have. In reality i couldve spent the money on a more performant card that will be quieter for less $ haha.   I understand it may be more difficult to find a full cover block now and that is why i am also inquiring about a universal block and opinions on that.

What I don't get with the Define S, why don't they lift the top another 2-3cm? So you could fit a 5-6cm 420 with space to spare.

watercooling,33apln,RumCannonball,2,Tue Apr 21 00:09:27 2015 UTC,I would use the thicker RX series rad and do the push/pull setup to maximize the cooling for the case.
watercooling,33apln,NZXT-xD3aDPooLx,2,Tue Apr 21 01:31:07 2015 UTC,"Agreed, if you are adamant about sticking to a single 360, make it a fat one.   Personally I've got a 30mm 360 and a 40mm 280 cooling a 4690k and r9 290 in this case."
watercooling,33apln,Mr_Snippy,2,Tue Apr 21 01:52:07 2015 UTC,I've just build a H440 too. It will be a tight fit for push pull setup. Where will you put your pump res?
watercooling,33apln,Terrytay2013,2,Tue Apr 21 04:27:41 2015 UTC,Probably should have mentioned that I'm only using push. Heard that push/pull really isn't that much better.   I underestimated the size of my pump /res (xspc photon) and it wouldn't fit between the gpu  and front rad. Had to mount it externally using the rear fan grate.
watercooling,33apln,Mr_Snippy,1 point,Tue Apr 21 16:52:13 2015 UTC,"Yikes, yea I'm looking to avoid that. I've seen some images of people mounting their pumps to the middle fan slot on their 360's in the front. They also got some really good lines with their for their rigid tubing."
watercooling,33apln,Mr_Snippy,1 point,Tue Apr 21 17:17:56 2015 UTC,"Definetly, I'm fairly certain that buying a mount and putting it directly onto the radiator would have worked.

watercooling,33apln,adog12341,1 point,Tue Apr 21 18:37:54 2015 UTC,"I just laid everything out last night and it doesn't look like push pull will work. I was planning on putting it in the front of the case with the drive bay removed, but like you said there isn't any room for pump res. Unfortunately the 360 doesn't fit flush against the top either and if I was to ""Jerry Rig"" it, there may be problems with it blocking the top of my mobo. It's looking more and more like I'll be running at least a 240 in the top. I may have to drop it down to a 120 depending on the size. I've also been looking on google images to see what creative ways people have fit rads in their H440's."
watercooling,33apln,Terrytay2013,2,Tue Apr 21 17:11:22 2015 UTC,Here's my H440.  It can fit quite a bit if you get creative and don't mind sacrificing your looks a tad.  Only thing I would change for mine is changing the rear 140 to a 120 so it actually fit in the fan slot instead of needing a fan to allow fitment.    Front: AX360 with push fan set intake  Top: Magicool G2 240mm/27mm thick rad with push fan set exhausting  Back: Phobya 140mm with 140mm pushing from the rear (intake)
watercooling,33apln,Terrytay2013,1 point,Wed Apr 22 03:44:10 2015 UTC,It looks like I'm going to upgrade to the RX 360 and mount it to the front in pull. I'll then mount my pump res to the back of the top 120mm fan port. With the formula VII there is a wireless card that attaches to the top of the mobo so there isn't much room to have a second rad so I'll more than likely be only using the 360.

watercooling,338e1v,Nerdkid72,1 point,Mon Apr 20 16:12:53 2015 UTC,It may be all in me head but when i put in a heavy card I always tightened the top pci bracket screw real tight first and it always picked up a ton of sag and then i tightened down the bottom one to help hold it in place. maybe if you tighten the middle/bottom one first it holds the card still and doesn't let the top screw help pick up the card more? It may make no difference but you can always try doing the top first then the lower one...my 780 and ek full block don't have any noticeable sag
watercooling,338e1v,Nerdkid72,1 point,Mon Apr 20 18:34:22 2015 UTC,As said above its because the case was knocked - the bracket is bent. It's secure for now so I'll deal with it later down the line. That photo makes it look worse than it is!

You could save £100 by doing that yourself.   Part choices look ok, at your budget though it's kind of a choose what you want scenario. As mentioned already you should plan the loop out to work out best runs/necessary fittings (Bitspower fittings are about £15 each, so having the price as £17.30 will not even close to cover your build).  Noticed you've gone for a pump/red combo too, any particular reason why? In a 900D you could easily fit multiple pumps and separate reservoirs. I'd recommend a D5 Vario mounted in the bottom of the case and your choice of res in the top so it's visible but that's an aesthetic choice tbh."

watercooling,3375v6,Born_To_Roam,2,Mon Apr 20 04:08:20 2015 UTC,Unless you are planning to do 3/4 way SLI your PSU is big times overkill. Going with too much watts output will only reduce the efficience and add additional noise. Most PSUs have the highest efficiency at 50% load. If you want to go with 1 or 2 cards a 750 watts is more than enough. 500 would work out great with 1 but there won't be much headroom once you throw a second card in.

And if you are picking it, why not air cool?  Xeon processors are locked, you cannot over clock that at all, and it's literally a little more expensive than the 5960x which is also 8 core, but unlocked for over clocking."
watercooling,3375v6,willdenham,1 point,Mon Apr 20 05:27:57 2015 UTC,"I picked it because it marked better in rendering benchmarks. Also it's supposed to be more reliable than i7s and you can use ECC ram with it. Which was recommended when you go 32gb and over especially if you're doing higher end graphics and video editing work.  - Basically I chose it for when I upgrade later.  I did read that you can increase the base clock on Xeons for a modest gain.   I could be wrong though, that's why I'm posting for some feedback.  Any suggestions on water cooling?"
watercooling,3375v6,niceandcreamy,1 point,Mon Apr 20 06:26:26 2015 UTC,Check the sidebar for information and get started picking your parts. It will help you in the long run if you put a list together and then ask us if everything will play nice. With that case you'll be looking for a triple rad and a dual rad which should be plenty for that processor and 980s.

watercooling,336m39,niceandcreamy,1 point,Mon Apr 20 02:50:07 2015 UTC,do you control it by rpm or temps? most Ive seen is setting pumps to run low on idle and when the temps pick up so does the pump. I want to be able to set specific rpm's.
watercooling,336m39,tedlasman,2,Mon Apr 20 02:58:46 2015 UTC,You really don't need to adjust pump speeds at all unless you really have a crazy setup. Most pumps are really overkill for watercooling so just set it to where you can't hear it and leave it there. If you really want proof that speed doesn't matter much set the pump at full and run a stress test and then set it at silent and do it again.

watercooling,334ukq,Alestor,2,Sun Apr 19 18:18:22 2015 UTC,If it's made by hardware labs then it's quality. Deffinatly by far my favorite brand of radiators. I had originally built a system with a xspc ax360 and it was white so I switched it out with a black hwlabs sr2 and it took my temps down by 10c all around the board with the same fans and fan speed. Also that is incorrect xspc makes a crossfire rad. But I don't thing there are arena advantages or disadvantages it's just how it's set up with arena fitting port on each side.

watercooling,33346i,metallives,1 point,Sun Apr 19 03:46:21 2015 UTC,Push is going to give better performance in this case. As far as the dust just use a can of air or better yet an air compressor when it comes to the time you want to clean it. It's going to get dusty no matter what unless you can somehow filter our all the dust in your house. Seems weird that behind fans get so dusty and everything in your house doesn't I guess because they pull so much more air it accumulates quicker..
watercooling,333mup,RichieRichness,1 point,Sun Apr 19 05:10:48 2015 UTC,"Normal compression fittings are effectively the same as barbs.   With rotary fittings, you can twist the tubing in place, which gives you a little more flexibility. Notice how your current barbs don't rotate at the base. They tend to be a little bulkier, a little more expensive, and they're inherently more prone to leaks than non-rotary fittings. I've had a rotary fitting leak through the bearing before.   Angled fittings are the same as rotary, except with a bend in them (usually 30, 45, 60 or 90 degrees). This just helps you route your way through tight spaces or corners more easily, and can make runs shorter and straighter.   All three will work for you, it depends on what you want to do really. I think that normal compression fittings are fine if you haven't got any problems with your current barbs. A pic would help."

You might want to take a look at the black ice radiators, they have a higher fin density.  Take a look at this EVGA psu. Ek's cpu blocks looks better imo, and the case is (imo) ugly and won't show off your water as well as other cases can, while fitting more radspace. Take a look at the Corsair Obsidian Graphite cases, or a fractal design define r5. I would a 240, at least, for that cpu and another 240 for the 390x, considering it will most likely be under water from the factory. The difference between 120 and 140 shouldn't be that great. Since you will be waiting, check out Barrow fittings on AliExpress, they are muuuuch cheaper, and have same/similar quality as Bitspower. Although I would stay with the Koolance quick disconnects.

I'll definitely switch to the EK, but do you know where I could buy it in the US?  Although the case does have some radiator shortcomings, it's probably one of the only things I'm set on keeping, I really enjoy this case. That being said, I'll probably mod the door to either enlarge the window, or add a second where the fan is; I've seen a  youtube video of somebody with it modded, it shouldn't be too ridiculous.   Since the water-cooled edition of the 390x will have a 120mm, do you think that it would have high temps?

watercooling,3338em,metallives,1 point,Sun Apr 19 03:50:15 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the input, all advice it appreciated.   If I were to stay with the bay reservoir, do you think no-spill quick disconnect compression fittings would help make filling and draining the reservoir easier?"
watercooling,3338em,metallives,1 point,Sun Apr 19 13:54:42 2015 UTC,no because its a pain in the ass because you have to slide it out of the bay in order to fill it. you could easily make a drain port with a tblock or mini valve to make drainage easier it would probably be even more of a pain in the ass ig you went with quick disconnects because you would have to reach inside the computer into the back of the drive bay in order to switch them to the non flow side and actually disconnect them.  also this would only make it so that you could pull the res out and fill it.  when you turn the pump on the res will deplete quickly and you will have to put more distilled water or whatever into it.
watercooling,3338em,metallives,1 point,Sun Apr 19 14:13:23 2015 UTC,"Another question, what if I used an external flushing system? I want to get another D5 and attach it to some input tubing and a quick disconnect fitting, and then have another piece of drainage tubing with a quick disconnect fitting on it.   Then, I can disconnect the tubing that leads into the reservoir and attach it to the drainage tubing, and attach the input tubing to the  fitting that leads out of the reservoir, into the pump. That way, I can pump new distilled water through my entire loop, flushing the system without having to wait for it to drain, and I can clean my reservoir separately. As for filling the loop, I'd be able to re-attach the tubing leading into the reservoir, but fill the loop through the external pump, which would fill the reservoir fairly quickly.  It's a bit unorthodox, but it would increase the downtime of draining my loop. I've seen somebody post about using an external pump to flush their loop somewhere in the comments in this sub, and I thought it'd be great to copy their method."
watercooling,3338em,metallives,1 point,Sun Apr 19 19:05:28 2015 UTC,Uh I'm not sure I really understand what you are going for adding another pump into the loop will cause un- necessary pressure. one d5 should be enough for 2 gpus and a cpu
watercooling,3338em,metallives,1 point,Mon Apr 20 01:02:56 2015 UTC,"Ah, sorry, I didn't explain this.  The extra D5 pump will be external.

watercooling,3338em,limitz,1 point,Mon Apr 20 01:06:37 2015 UTC,Ah ok that makes sense yes as long as it's not in the loop i guess that would work fine.  It seems like a whole bunch of extra stuff for not really a giant improvement but maybe I just am not understanding why you would wire another system outside of the one already in the system I just use a y block to split the water and then a drain tube with a water plug in it It's below the res and lower rad so when ever I want to drain the system I just unplug the water stop And put the extra tube in a bucket drains the entire system in about 3 seconds

The Enthoo Primo is potentially one of the best cases on the market for watercooling and with a loop budget of £500 you're going for glory.   It's worth investigating whether you want hardline or flexible tubing as both are within your budget. If you go flexi you want Primochill advanced LRT to avoid buildup of plasticiser. If you go hardline then look for acrylic/PETG and you'll need bending tools. Fittings must be chosen carefully based on the internal and external diameter of the tubing. Bitspower and Primochill do great fittings (and in white) but they are expensive.  I think you should check the temps/performance of that GPU and potentially swap it for a different 980 with an custom block. It's within your budget so if you can get better performance you may as well go fully custom. As an FYI the MATRIX cards by Asus are insane - my 780ti with an EK block will rarely go above 30c under gaming load, whilst overclocked enough to beat a 980 at stock.  CPU block - going to recommend the EK Supremacy EVO. I own one and from general browsing it seems to be accepted as the best on the market. Generally you don't want to mix metals as it might cause corrosion so if you have a copper CPU block go copper everything else. Avoid aluminium at all costs.  Radiator - you ideally want slight positive pressure in the case so if you have a 480 make sure you have enough intake fans. You could go for a 360 up top, 240 in front and be sorted even if adding another GPU. Hardwarelabs and Alphacool make some excellent rads. Also going to shout out EK's Vardar fans over the corsairs - Vardars are specifically designed for rads and are silent, although corsairs would be fine.  Liquid - distiller water with biocide performs best. If you want something prettier or a dye then Mayhems or EK have a good line of offerings. Just avoid Mayhems Aurora - it's not designed for general use. Do not use a kill coil with nickel blocks.  Pump/res - why a combo? I also don't think you need two pumps. A D5 Vario will comfortably run your loop even if you added another GPU. The EK D5 Vario X-Res combo unit is an excellent performer and you can expand the size of the red if you want. Avoid bay reservoirs - generally they're lower quality and more of a pain to use than cylinders.  Hope that helps... Everything I've listed is available in the UK. I got most of my stuff from OCUK but I've also used WCUK and they were fine."

watercooling,330q4s,Jbsmk2,5,Sat Apr 18 11:09:56 2015 UTC,"The fin density is usually measured in FPI (Fins Per Inch). A higher number means higher density.  The higher FPI rads have a technical advantage in that cooling potential is largely a function of flow rate and surface area. By having more fins their surface area is higher so they can potentially offer better cooling. The catch is that the dense fins are very restrictive to air flow, so at low RPM the benefit of the larger surface area is cancelled by the reduction in flow rate.  As a general rule, low FPI radiators will respond fairly predictably to fan RPM. High FPI radiators perform poorly at low RPM but will excel when used with high speed fans. I'd advise getting a low FPI radiator if you're on the fence about it because they provide more flexibility.  How much rad space you actually need depends on how much noise you're willing to tolerate and what temperature you deem acceptable, not to mention the fact that I have no idea what wattage you're actually looking at. You have three variables: noise, rad space and temperature. Pick two and the third is dictated for you.  Personally I wouldn't go with less than 3x120mm worth, but that's based on what I would consider acceptable. I can explain the maths behind it if you'd prefer it to a general rule of thumb."

Are you relatively comfortable with SI units, the fact that we can combine units and the fact that units need to be treated like we would treat numbers in algebra?

watercooling,330q4s,funk_monk,1 point,Sat Apr 18 15:43:57 2015 UTC,I am comfortable with SI and also algebra :)
watercooling,330q4s,funk_monk,5,Sat Apr 18 16:00:34 2015 UTC,"Thermodynamics 101   Temperature Change   Every material has a volumetric heat capacity. This has units of J·cm-3·K-1. It is defined to be the amount of energy in joules required to raise the temperature of one cm3 of a substance by one kelvin (assuming there is no phase change). Water has a particularly high heat capacity and this is what makes it such an excellent coolant.  Flow rate can be measured in cm3·s-1  Heat output is measured in J·s-1 (more commonly called watts)  We combine the units like so...  (heat output) / ((volumetric heat capacity) * (flow rate))  The units cancel and we're left with a result in kelvin. If we plug in values for our coolant flow rate, power output and heat capacity we can use this to give us the coolant delta from the start of the loop to the finish. If you work it out this rarely comes to more than a degree or so. We can more or less treat the temperature of the coolant as being constant throughout the loop.   Heat Transfer   Heat flows from a hot place to a cold place. If the difference in temperature is small then not much heat will be transferred. If the temperature difference is large then things will happen much more quickly. The rate at which this happens is proportional to the temperature difference.  To complicate things, you have what is called thermal resistance. Something like polystyrene has a very high resistance whereas a metal like copper has extremely low resistance. Thermal resistance also influences the rate of heat transfer. Larger thermal resistances mean that less heat is transferred.  While the thermal resistance between the core in chips and the coolant is objectively very low, the amount of heat coming out of the core is extremely high for its size, so the resistance becomes an issue. This is why your components always run hotter than your coolant.  If you increase the temperature of the coolant then the temperature delta between the coolant and the core will decrease, making the heat transfer decrease. Because less heat is being removed from the chip it will also rise in temperature. The temperature will continue to rise until the system reaches equilibrium. This is why convection cooling will never go below ambient temperature.  The bright side of this is that coolant temperature has a linear relationship to the temperature that our parts run at. If the temperature of the coolant raises by ten degrees then our component temperatures will raise by the same amount.   Radiators   Radiators also have some nice maths behind them because they're essentially working like a larger version of our water blocks. Our coolant is air and the radiators are putting out heat at a rate equivalent to our system wattage.  For a given volume of air flowing through the radiator per second, we can derive a value which tells us what temperature the coolant will run at compared to the outside air temperature when it's being heated at a constant rate. This is a fairly linear relationship. If we half the wattage then the temperature delta between the coolant and the air will also half.  Radiator reviews will often publish a value in K·W-1 (they actually usually use Celsius but Kelvin can be used interchangeably here and Kelvin is infinitely better). They will state at what speed the fans were running as a rough approximation of air flow rate and they should also state the coolant flow rate (although the latter part doesn't really matter much). Multiply your system wattage by that value and that will give you the temperature delta between the coolant and the ambient air assuming the same amount of air is flowing through the radiator as was in the test. I'd prefer it if they gave figures which took flow rate into account, but I understand that measuring the flow rate of a fan is difficult so they need to compromise. Your best bet is to try and find a figure which will approximately match your requirements.  Another good thing about all this is that it's easy to combine. If the listed value in a review is for a 360mm version of a radiator you're considering, but you can only fit a 240mm rad, the figure can be multiplied by the size ratio (3/2). If you want to run two equivalent radiators then the same applies. Bear in mind this will only apply to radiators where all else is equal - which in practice means that you can only do this with same-family radiators.    I'm not the best teacher, so I might have missed a few things, but feel free to ask if you're confused about something. I've tried to include most of the relevant things. There are a few modelling assumptions, but largely speaking it's solid and you should be able to use it to calculate what's reasonable and what isn't given a set of requirements.  For example, if you set out with the intention of never running your fans beyond 1000RPM and never having a coolant delta above ten degrees, you should be able to use it to calculate roughly what radiator setup would be capable of achieving that goal.  I've not seen the figures for the radiators published on manufacturers websites, but you can find them on reviews. Sometimes they don't directly quote a numerical value, but they will do something equivalent like list the amount of heat the radiator can dissipate at a certain temperature delta. You said you're good with algebra so you should be able to interpret the graphs and values to get back to something useful."

watercooling,330q4s,xNPi,2,Mon Apr 20 06:14:11 2015 UTC,Generally the rule of thumb is 120mm of rad space per component you want to cool so if you wanted to cool a cpu and two gpus that would be a minimum of 360mm of rad space.  Higher fun density gives more area.for the heat to dissipate so you could use slower fans

Smaller tubing has more maleability, meaning you can go around sharp turns without kinking your tubes.

If the copper on the outside of the block is coated with lacquer it will stay like new. Last I know EK didn't do that on the exterior of their blocks and I don't believe they did even on the CPU blocks but I could be wrong.

Your radiators should be fine. Flushing them with a few passes of distilled water should clear out any flakes that could be sitting inside.  To be honest, I doubt the block has affected anything else in the system because the extent of the corrosion is pretty minimal, but I understand that you want to be sure - I'd be doing the same in your situation.  EK did some extensive testing on the subject.

watercooling,32xezm,cvance10,1 point,Fri Apr 17 18:19:49 2015 UTC,"There are only a few options for pumps out there.  The top being a D5 which is very powerful and quiet.  A D5 is probably more than you need, but if you ever expand then you are set.  A DDC is a little cheaper and smaller than the D5.  It has good power, but is known to run hotter and noisier.  You should be able to find those pumps for $50-$80 with the D5 being $10-$20 more expensive.  There are other cheaper pumps out there, but the cost and performance make them much harder to recommend.  XSPC has a couple of pump/rads that are popular.  Bother of them should also work for a CPU/GPU setup."
watercooling,32xezm,reikes,1 point,Fri Apr 17 17:34:36 2015 UTC,"I started with a DDC, but I greatly prefer the D5 I replaced it with.  Note that with most D5 models they have 1/2"" barbs instead of 1/4"" NTP, so if you are using smaller tubing, you might want to spring for a aftermarket D5 top ($~40?).    I also found that my DDC was much louder, which was a problem for me as I wanted as quiet as possible (even over perf).  Finally, my DDC died after about a year."
watercooling,32xezm,freewibblebon,1 point,Fri Apr 17 17:48:44 2015 UTC,An Aquastream XT would do a good job and have tons of headroom. Or the more popular choice of a D5. They both have tons of headroom and are really quiet (especially the XT).

However, that was before I got into watercooling. If you are liquid cooling the CPU, note that it doesn't need much more that a 120mm/140mm radiator with a decent fan, which can be placed on the fan mounts in the rear/bottom (you know, in the compartment where the PSU and HDD's go). You may have remove the SSD mount tray, but you'll have plenty of airflow for it. Anyway, because you can put the CPU cooler out of the way, you should be able to cool both GPU's respectably with a 120mmx2 radiator in the front, but measure your TDP and such and select an appropriate thickness (and you should be able to easily get an 60mm-80mm+ rad in there with fans), but again, proper fan selection is necessary.   If you aren't afraid of modifying the case a little bit, you can mount another radiator on the top of the case, while having the fans on the outside (or vice versa with a rad grill for protection)."

You don't need to take the whole thing out, and using QDCs just sounds frustrating since you'll need to reconnect them every time you fill the bay and let it drain into the tubing.  Pumps will still pass water even when not running. People run dual pumps primarily for redundancy so that if one pump fails the other can pick up the slack, if one pump failing obstructed the loop then that wouldn't be possible."

You can buy the exact same stuff cheaper without the batch certification under the st gobains brand. I use their plasticizer free chemical resistant stuff currently.

watercooling,32uw6a,boanerges57,3,Fri Apr 17 04:25:25 2015 UTC,"Tygon is lab grade batch certified tubing. The quality control is the product. The only issues anyone had with tygon was related to plasticizer and that was only a certain kind of tygon. Tygon brand rubbing from st gobains was available without plasticizer before primochill and any of the others. The reason water coolers ended up with the non plasticizer free stuff was because that is a cheaper product and many retailers didn't list the product number for the tygon they sold.  For the algae they even make a silver anti microbial lined tubing.  Tygon is a range of tubing (not all of which is plasticizer free) that undergoes testing of each batch to very specific lab quality ratings.  Since none of us requires a ce, Iso or other  rating for our water cooling loops it can be more affordable to get the non batch tested st gobains brand. Just make certain it is plasticizer free. This can be easily done with google or the st gobains website. This is still lab grade tubing made on the same line just not batch tested."

watercooling,32ukcy,digitalambassador,3,Thu Apr 16 20:52:47 2015 UTC,"Would I be correct in thinking you want a closed loop cooler (""CLC""), such as the H80i you mention, rather than just a 120mm radiator to add to an existing (or planned) custom loop?  If so, give this a read. It's somewhat dated but will give you an idea of what to expect in terms of price/performance/noise.  I do think you should investigate whether a CLC running a single 120mm rad will actually outperform a good air cooler enough to justify the extra expense."

watercooling,32ukcy,804R,1 point,Fri Apr 17 14:59:37 2015 UTC,CLC/AIO same thing and either way are not as good as you might think. My friend has one and its pretty loud. Doesn't cool it much better than a large air cooler if at all.
watercooling,32ukcy,DarkStarrFOFF,1 point,Fri Apr 17 17:30:21 2015 UTC,"That really depends on a lot of things. I used to have an AIO, but it was, as you said, loud and inefficient. However, if I had added another fan or placed it differently, it would've worked better."
watercooling,32ukcy,804R,1 point,Fri Apr 17 17:52:17 2015 UTC,"Yea for me the cost to performance benefit isn't there. Not worth what it costs over an air cooler. But then again I'm of the, if you're gonna do it, do it right mindset so I jumped right in and went full loop with compression fittings and all. No barbs (though I ended up with like 25 or something 1/2 barbs)."
watercooling,32ukcy,DarkStarrFOFF,1 point,Fri Apr 17 17:58:15 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm in the process myself, but getting watercooling parts in Norway is a pain in the butt."
watercooling,32ukcy,804R,1 point,Fri Apr 17 18:06:29 2015 UTC,"watercooling parts in Norway   I'm sure. Ive gotten pretty lucky with my hardware. Got 2 Black Ice GTX 360s + a Black Ice GTX 120, EK Full Copper CPU block + a couple other GPU blocks, a D5 + D5 bayres and a bunch of Bitspower Comp fittings and some koolance ones for $150. Guy just wanted it gone. I almost didn't reply thinking it was fake."
watercooling,32ukcy,DarkStarrFOFF,2,Fri Apr 17 18:19:35 2015 UTC,"I had a 120mm CLC on a 8320 about a year ago, those suckers can put out some heat though under load. Ended up getting a larger cooler due to high ambient temperatures in the summer time. I would definitely get something a little bigger."
watercooling,32ukcy,CastlePounder,1 point,Fri Apr 17 14:33:19 2015 UTC,"If you want to overclock, than i would suggest you to get more than just 120. The 8320 can produce some heat if you clock it up^"
watercooling,32ukcy,shiki87,1 point,Fri Apr 17 00:20:53 2015 UTC,The only problem i have with getting more than a 140 is that with my case the top mounting would be asymmetrical and that would bug the crap out of me.  Also didn't Linus say Push/Pull was equal to push/push or am I remembering wrong?
watercooling,32ukcy,xNPi,2,Fri Apr 17 00:55:31 2015 UTC,Extra fans aren't going to make up for double the radiator space.
watercooling,32ukcy,shiki87,2,Fri Apr 17 03:35:18 2015 UTC,"Push/pull is a bit better than only push or pull, but nothing is better than more radiatorspace than more radiatorspace, like xNPi said"
watercooling,32ukcy,804R,1 point,Fri Apr 17 10:40:49 2015 UTC,then It goes back to the asymmetrical thing.  I have the define r5 if you're wondering.
watercooling,32ukcy,804R,2,Fri Apr 17 13:49:37 2015 UTC,"You can easily put a 240mm in the top of that case. I'd recommend that as it will make much less noise for the same performance (or higher performance with the same noise), especially if you use 4 120mm fans."
watercooling,32ukcy,bobthetrucker,1 point,Fri Apr 17 14:50:44 2015 UTC,would it really make less noise because then I'd be taking the top pannels off which is what the case used for sound dampening.
