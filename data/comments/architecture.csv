architecture,3e2uxp,jgopp,3,Tue Jul 21 19:50:46 2015 UTC,"agreeing with jgopp, the kitchen is way bigger than it probably once was, all of the FLW designed furniture he included in all his homes is gone, and a lot of the walls are painted in richer colors than I'm sure he intended.    Obviously I'm making some assumptions here, and the house as it stands is most likely more functional and inviting than it was in 1917, but my original point  stands that the modest price, despite being a FLW, is reflective of these changes and the house's overall plainness compared to his more famous homes."
architecture,3e2uxp,magyar_wannabe,2,Tue Jul 21 23:11:35 2015 UTC,The all caps probably caused the price drop! I'm guessing the owners sunk all their money into the house and then someone lost a job or something. They need to get out from under it. Beverly is a nice neighborhood with nice homes.

architecture,3dvq5x,hexagonalshit,29,Mon Jul 20 02:19:03 2015 UTC,"It's supposed to mean Architects are jack-of-all-trades. They need to understand each consultant's profession enough to not be flummoxed when discussing them and enough to be able to anticipate problems that might require 2 or 3 consultants getting in a room with you to discuss them.   To use a freestanding restaurant as an example:   Your MEP consultant won't care to discuss the advantages of truss types (all-wood, wood & steel, all steel) beyond ensuring they have enough drop or opening to run ducts.   Your structural consultant won't care to discuss 1 15-ton units vs. 1 7-ton & 2 5-ton units beyond knowing where to provide bracing and wanting to know what the curb opening will be.   Your civil won't care about any of that, but wants to know about what curb type you're using and where he needs to route the water, sewer, power, phone, gas and data.  Also, it's your job to tell them where the ERC loop and menu board goes for the drive-through.   Your kitchen consultant doesn't care about any of that but wants the MEP to provide ducting for the grease hood. The MEP will calculate power and duct size but won't guarantee anything beyond ""we provided the duct from the hood to the fan. Any lack of exhaust is because of the equipment that the KC's supplier provided.""  You, the Architect, have to care about all of it and coordinate it properly. In addition to that you need to understand life safety, zoning, signage reqs, energy code (for the building envelope) and the client's standards for their brand.  All for less money than each of the listed consultants are paid."

It takes an architect (and good one) to be able to co-ordinate all trades in a meaningful way, because he will understand all aspects of the design and will lead others to get to an optimised, effcient, beautifully simple result. Having said that, there are engineers who have this ability to see larger picture, think outside of their trade and utilise lateral thinking for problem solving, which is always a fantastic advantage and allows to achieve far more when working together on a complex scheme."

I disagree completely with /u/Merusk when he describes the engineering consultants not being interested in each others work. Its more we appreciate that their field is as deep as our own and a superficial understanding is often misleading or simply not much use- one of the reasons engineers frequently get frustrated with architects!  Coordination of it all isn't the architect's job. It's the project managers.

The consultants largely don't care.   As for the coordination being the PM not the Architect, that's also different experiences. I haven't worked on hi-rises and sprawling multi-national campuses in my career. I've touched public buildings like city halls and university buildings down to retail strip outlets. In almost all of those projects the architect was the PM.  On only 2 projects in my career has there been a PM that wasn't the architect or me. Those projects were for clients who had invested in building-up a construction infrastructure because they were rolling-out multiple projects. (Restaurant chains for multiple franchises.)

architecture,3dvq5x,Anarchytects,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:32:06 2015 UTC,Well the reason they don't get paid like say a lawyer would is because architects don't necessarily make the client any money. If the lawyer wins a huge case they get a cut. The value that an Architect brings to a building is somewhat intangible so for someone who doesn't care how well there building is designed won't understand or want to pay for its value. Which is why a industry like architecture needs a union or something like that to make sure we are getting paid what we are worth.
architecture,3dvq5x,ohnokono,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:48:52 2015 UTC,"No union, no. You're a professional and you're on your own. The professional groups can't mandate salaries or fee structures.

architecture,3dvq5x,ohnokono,2,Mon Jul 20 17:39:58 2015 UTC,"It's a long game (and one the AIA is sort of pursuing), but we need the public to understand and value what we do - both in design and construction management. Architects add value by creating high quality environments and through the logistical management of the construction process. These things are often the first to get removed from a project when costs start to add up because people don't understand their value. For one thing, this value isn't necessarily immediate - a low quality building can look much the same as a high quality one but it won't weather well or adapt to future conditions.  Another solution may be to expand the scope of services offered by architects. I think this is beginning to happen in the world of planning, urban design, real estate, or facilities management. Architects can provide a type of broad critical thinking that can help solve complex problems. The challenge here is finding clients that are willing to pay for these types of services."

I went back to school to get my Master's Degree and that, paired with 8 years of experience, allowed me to just nail job interviews because I've done it all, from SD to CA.  The last job I interviewed for didn't even ask to see a portfolio, because I was able to tell them what I knew and the back and forth conversation let them know where I stood.  With that being said, there comes a point in your career where you literally do everything a licensed architect does and getting the actual license is a formality at best.  That's where I'm at now.  I got licensed in June of this year and really all it did for me was make it official (and allow me to sign drawings).  Your experience is going to be the most important part of getting a job."

So, it's going to be a while before you have to sign anything. I've always seen licensure as something that shows what you're capable of and that you have a solid knowledge of the job. It can show your commitment to the profession and it will never hurt your chances of getting hired.   That being said, because you aren't going to be signing anything any time soon, the main thing they will care about is what you are capable of. The main thing in interviews, at least in my experience, is to make it clear what you did on the projects you have in your portfolio. For instance, I always through in some technical details in my (like wall sections) to make it clear I do know that aspect of the job. They may not be sexy images, but it's good to have it.   I'm finally getting around to start taking the exams after about 7 years. I've waited this long partly because I work long hours (which makes it difficult to find time to study) and there really isn't that much of a financial incentive to do it. You'll get a small bump in pay, but it's not going to suddenly change your life in any significant way."

Make sure it's something you really want to do and work hard on finding the right school that might give you a scholarship to offset some of the cost.  Additionally make sure it's a school worth attending that is right for you. If your looking at architecture as a way of making money it's not for you. It's a very culturally rich and rewarding profession but we don't make so much money. It works for me because I don't want stuff I want to design stuff.

In regards to their statements such as ""lost craft of plaster"" and the ""demise of the plasterer as a tradesperson"" by the author, they have a personal resonance with me.   “No one does that kind of work anymore.” I hear this all the time. I've heard it while I was actually on a scaffold doing that kind of work. Someone will pass by to ask me what I'm doing, perhaps I'm placing some plaster ornament, and they'll say, “too bad, no one does that kind of work anymore!” I used to think such persons were either complete idiots or being malicious. That of course was usually not the case. This idea is so firmly entrenched that despite the fact that the person sees craft happening right in front of their eyes they still can't believe it. Academia has convinced them that crafts such as plastering are dead and gone so that's it. Unless apparently a robot is doing some semblance of it that looks like Colgate tartar control squeezed over lath...that's a future we can bank on."
architecture,3dt2vn,burritoace,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:59:44 2015 UTC,"Of course when people say ""no one does that work anymore"" they are generalizing, and in fact you are a perfect example of someone who does that kind of work. The same can be said of most traditional crafts, but in the industry as a whole it is true that these crafts are rarely used. It seems to me that you are not advocating for maintaining the status quo (in which people generally don't do traditional work but a few specialists do) but are actually interested in much broader application of these crafts.  You have expressed significant interest in the idea of generational improvement over time, and I don't see why a robot engaging in plaster work doesn't fit that category. Pinning ideological differences to the use of different tools also feels like a canard to me - I think beauty and creativity can be found in projects made through any means. I'm not particularly interested in ornament or plaster work, but this project made me think about it's role in architecture and the potential for interesting new constructions which unite traditional craft with contemporary production.  I guess this is a tangent, but I am consistently surprised by your insistence that the reason plaster, etc. are not often used in construction anymore is because of crusading Modernists leading an ideological charge against anybody who works with their hands, when it is obvious to me that the vast shifts in economic conditions and production (which coincided with and influenced, but were not created by, the Modern movement) are what really drove these changes. This project is an effort to integrate traditional techniques with contemporary production, and as such is a pretty interesting addition to the field and maybe our broader discussion."

Automation has been the way of things. We traded hand ploughs for oxen and horses, we traded those for tractors and now we have GPS driven combines. This has been the inevitable way of things. You seem to have an inherent misunderstanding and distrust of computers. I'll assure as someone who works in software that Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) is not as close as Kertzweil would have you believe. It is true though that we are reaching a point where greater and greater amounts of automation are possible. Firstly people had this kind of reaction to the introduction of the tractor. All farm jobs would dry up. That didn't happen it actually created new jobs. This time may not be the same as the robots fixing robots that fix robots will be real. As we approach what has been mockingly referred to as 'the 2050 problem' we have to start consider if people should be defined by their job or if rather possibly they should be defined by their works. You seem stuck on this idea and don't want to consider how to value a person for being a person and not what they bring to an economy.

There are fire-life safety issues with changing walls in a commercial space. And definitely ADA compliance review. And depending on where you are, plumbing, electrical, energy code & green building code will come up, as well as some seismic issues regarding wall and ceiling bracing. I'd at least consult with a few architects before you get involved with a contractor. And you should know that architects do a hell of a lot more than just create plans for permits and pick finishes. Yes, the architect will help you navigate all code requirements and pull the permits, but beyond that, you need to specify all materials, finishes, fixtures and equipment, and specify the standard of quality and workmanship for their installation. Permit drawings are bare minimum. You should really draw all significant interior wall elevations and all millwork and provide assembly details. The architect will be able to help you interview and choose a contractor. Then once construction begins the architect should provide periodic inspections throughout construction to ensure that the contractor is providing everything in your contract, including the drawings and specifications. Of course you could also go to a design-build firm to do all of this, but beware that is like having the fox guard the henhouse and you lose the ability to competitively bid the project.

architecture,3dt0j4,sarch,8,Tue Jul 21 02:44:16 2015 UTC,"According to the NAAB's records, Woodbury University's Master of Architecture (3 year) program was granted its initial accreditation in March of 2013. The program is in it's infancy, but if you graduated today, you would be eligible to sit for the ARE. However, NAAB will be scrutinizing the school for several years until it earns full accreditation, which means that accreditation could be revoked at any point.  With that being said, Woodbury has a 5 year B.Arch program that has been accredited since 1994, so they clearly have some idea about how to run an architecture school. The likelihood of your Masters program losing it's accreditation is pretty slim.  I checked out Woodbury's website and their student work seems to be pretty consistent with the work I've seen coming out of other universities. They are definitely emphasizing work involving computation design, which seems to be in high demand these days, at least at my firm.  Their staff page is gigantic, which makes me think they're listing pretty much everyone who has stepped foot on campus. I would inquire about their core staff (excluding administrative personnel), as they will probably have a large influence on your work and studies. Architecture schools often inflate their staff numbers for statistical reporting.  Finally, take a look at the facilities. Does every student get a desk? Make note of the pin-up spaces. Take a look at the student work lying around... Your work will probably end up looking similar. How is the craftsmanship? If it looks like something you can do now, it's probably shit. No offense. Woodbury does have a wood & metal shop with a CNC mill, laser cutters, and 3D printers. This is a very good thing. These are resources that will allow you to express your ideas physically. Nothing is more frustrating than a project that requires a tool that you don't have access to.  I have never heard of Woodbury, but since I'm on the east coast, that isn't terribly surprising.

Mostly this is because they hire new grads with zero teaching or work experience, and then run them through their courses essentially reteaching the best of what they themselves got just a couple of years before. Plus the price is a problem. I certainly would recommend the UCLA or UCB MArch program before this one. Lastly, the comment is correct that their staff page is completely unrepresentative of the faculty - always a red flag for any program. However, they are accredited, and if that's all you need, and you have the money, it's a fine program.

architecture,3dt0j4,Dragon_jones,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:34:28 2015 UTC,"No, but your degree will determine what kind of masters program you are eligible for.

A 4 year ""pre-professional"" degree in architecture may qualify you for a 2 year M.Arch (this is known as a 4+2 tack). Some schools offer 5yr B.Arch or BS.Arch programs which transition into a 1yr M.Arch program, though this is much less common.  The only majors that will grant you advanced standing in an M.Arch program are a B.Arch, a BS.Arch, or a BA.Arch. Everything else- whether it be engineering, industrial design, or basketweaving -is treated as a non-architectural degree, and will require at least 3 years of graduate study to earn a Masters."

Especially because when you go to your masters program you'll be a on a fast track of an architectural thesis and if you don't know what makes architectural moves smart, how the structure in a building works, and what to focus on in your design and paper, then you're kind of fucked.   But, you know, design comes easy to some people. I don't know your life. Maybe you are a natural born designer."

architecture,3dtclh,Merusk,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:08:28 2015 UTC,"For instance (and I'm not referring to phased construction in the sense of Phase 1, 2, etc.),   During the exposed phase, the foundation, the frame, and everything else are exposed to the elements but the natural ventilation of the site will normally dry out any materials that get wet. To minimize the potential for mold growth, it is important to develop a proactive plan to minimize the risk of water damage and wet surfaces due to external factors such as rain, snow, flooding, and high RH during the exposed and partially enclosed (contractor will normally begin to rough-in the interior and may install some of the finishes) phases. Appropriate construction sequencing avoids installing moisture-sensitive materials before the building is enclosed. The installation of protective barriers or temporary enclosures across building-envelope openings (walls, roof, and basement) and open areas to accommodate construction elevators/hoists and window installation is recommended. The use of water-resistant materials in areas susceptible to moisture also reduces the risk of mold growth. These decisions affect both the construction cost and schedule, and should be fully considered. Wet areas and materials should be dried within 24 hours of exposure.   (Avoidance of Mold, PCI Designer's Notebook)  And then things like what happens when a client requests a change that necessitates a re-order of the sequence of construction (to save money?) that then requires the construction of temporary facilities to store materials to be used later -- facilities that require money to build (lol).  I also think touching upon Fast Track construction would be valuable (probably no more than a 30 minute lecture).   As a lighting consultant, what I most especially hate is when lighting fixtures are installed BEFORE the adjacent surfaces get painted. There's nothing like watching stainless steel trims, mounting flanges, fancy lighting control touch panels, etc., get painted over by contractors that just don't care."

I have two suggestions for you:  I learned about construction mostly by working w/ Habitat for Humanity - I had a year long position with them the year before I started grad school. When I was in school, I tried to organize a day at Habitat as extra credit for students in the Building Construction class, but the local chapter did not have any active projects in the timeframe I was trying to do it. I would recommend trying to do something like that if possible - anything that gets them hands on experience on the construction site is going to miles further than any reading they could do.   I also developed an exercise that was really well received by students. I made three standard wall assemblies (2x6 stud, light guage, and CMU) that were made up of full scale materials, but were only about 18"" tall and 24"" wide. Each assembly had all the parts (top/bottom plates, insulation, int/ext finishes, WRB) that all connected to one another with velcro for easy assembly and dis-assembly. Once the students had assembled the walls, they had to draw a section of what they just put together using proper graphics. Each assembly was stored in a rubber-made style bin for easy organization and storage. And the answer keys were attached to the underside of the bin's lid.  This was the first exercise the students did before getting into a more in depth assignment that asked them to come up with better (higher R-value, less harmful materials, cheaper, etc...) wall assembly.   Hope that's helpful! Good luck!"

School itself taught nothing beyond base structural and MEP formulas. Detailing was concerned with how something looked, not about building science. (I recall one prof. who said my wall section was wrong because I had ""two structural systems"" when doing a stone panel/ masonry veneer.  He was so very, very wrong.)  In the 6 years of school to get my B. Arch (I went prior to their switch-over to 4+2) I had a single building science class.

Clients that want ""the famous name"" are going to seek them out and throw high-profile projects at them. That has and always will happen. There are always going to be private and public clients who say, ""this designer is tops, let's use them.""  Then the question is, who is that designer. Someone who conscientiously looks at the project and provides a stunning design grounded in extensive knowledge of building science, material availability and budget knowledge or just an artist who throws out a visually pleasing design with no concern for the rest.   Unfortunately for as long as I've been a part of the profession it's been the latter. ""Cost doesn't matter,"" ""Form is king,"" or ""the client doesn't know what they want, I DO."" has been the arrogant cry from so many designers I've encountered professionally and through study that it's just disappointing.  It's no wonder Architects in the US are being marginalized and we're seeing article after article about how the public doesn't perceive us as a value-add only an obstacle and a necessary evil to construction. We don't elevate those who push that form of architecture to the heights. We push people like Eisenmann, Pei, Hadid and Ghery, giving awards to project after project that are over-budget, under-thought and terrible to maintain because they look good.

After that there is an Architect of Record who is responsible for the actual Construction Documents.   The AOR is the one who actually check for code compliance, coordinates the consultants and stamps the drawings. Sometimes they work together but in my experience it's typically it's a hand-off with the designer wondering why you're ""bothering"" them after the fact. ""We already gave you the drawings, they're not getting paid for these questions, just figure it out."" (And I say this as someone who works for a Design firm, that's not resentment from someone who had to deal with them but professional embarrassment.)

architecture,3dqaqu,bayoubakery,16,Sat Jul 18 12:13:31 2015 UTC,"My firm designs commercial fit-outs like yours all the time, including a 14,000 SF space near DC right now, so from my standpoint I'd say (a) your architect's proposed fees seem unusually high and (b) you should definitely solicit proposals from at least one or two other experienced, qualified firms before moving ahead with this one. (This is assuming you do, in fact, just have a basic interior office space).  First of all, regarding fees: ""TI"" (tenant improvement) commercial interior renovations like the one you describe are typically valued by architects and engineers in rates of $/SF, not usually percentage of construction cost (which is more typical for residential). Your architect's 18% fee sounds like it would be more appropriate for high end residential design. In the Philadelphia and DC markets, architects typically charge at least $1.00/SF for just a basic set of TI construction drawings that will also get you a building permit. If you want additional services, like initial space planning, multiple revisions to your plans, help specifying materials, finishes, and furniture, special equipment or details, and/or construction administration, the fees can go up to $4.00/SF. In high end markets and applications, like NYC office spaces, the fees can be double that.   For the MEP design (HVAC, plumbing, electrical, etc.), you can figure another $1.00/SF. The engineer can be retained by the architect or on a ""design/build"" basis through the general contractor. For something as simple as this, I'd let MEP be handled by the GC, so long as they're reputable and qualified.  Second, regarding design services, be sure that whatever architect you talk to is clear about what services they're offering for their fee. Some will charge you the $1.00/SF and come back a week later with the most basic set of permitable drawings - with little to no information on finishes, light fixtures, millwork, furniture, etc. - leaving it up to the GC, for example, to pick the cheapest 2x4 T8 light fixtures, broadloom carpet, and residential grade door hardware s/he can find. Do these things matter to you? If so, ask for those design services to be included in the architect's proposal, and make sure they review these things with you for your approval during design.  Third, to make sure the GC builds and installs (a) the materials you paid for (b) in a manner that's consistent with the design you paid for, ask the architect to include ""CA"" (contract / construction administration) service in their proposal. This means you'll pay them to stick around during construction to review and approve submittals from the GC, observe construction to make sure the GC's building it according to plan, and answer any questions that come up or make any changes necessary. If the GC isn't holding up their end of the bargain, you're in a better position to know and stop work or payment to them.  Finally, I'd advise you to get your architect to prepare a complete set of construction documents that have enough information so you can send them out to two or three qualified, reputable GC's for a hard, competitive bid. A basic 2,400 SF office fit-out shouldn't be more than $50/SF in hard costs, assuming you don't have any crazy finishes or German light fixtures.  Look around your area to find both architects and GC's that specialize in TI work - there's a whole sub-industry that just focus on this kind of construction, so you should be able to find a few. It might make more sense to find an architect that you're happy with first (ask to see their projects and speak to their clients, too, btw), and then get them to refer you to a few GC's. They'll most likely have already worked with a few they know and trust. I hope this helps. Good luck."

To help on scope, we're looking for some finishes but we have already identified every appliance, counters, carpeting, and tile and provided a spreadsheet to the architect in order to maintain facility continuity. The guy needs to draw some rooms and walls on a CAD and add a few finishing touches for curb appeal and light transmission to the back of the space. It just doesn't seem challenging to me and as a novice CAD-monkey myself, I could even handle the basics of this for a lot less than the $18K he's quoting me that doesn't include any CA.  We really need someone who can give us designs that protect us from contractors plus some CA plus I fully intend to walk through every single day so I know the contractor workers aren't tossing their trash into the framing or other weird, passive aggressive things they like to do.  Lastly, it's nice to hear your anecdotes but do you have anything to add to help this brotha' out? I have got to get a decent build this time or it's going to break me.

I'm a one of a rare bunch of architects that actually loves client interaction. I mean that in running a business, I have to factor project length into the fees, regardless of whether the work is ""active development"" or just ""periodic updates"". Hence, why scenario #3 gets a higher quote than a simple Alt-2 that I can self-cert and get permits for in a matter of a week.  What I'd do if I was in your situation is ask for an hourly rate, though if I was that architect, I'd require a higher cap than 18k because I really prefer flat fees. If you're really sure it's a quick job, and you're not going to burn through 150 hours of the architect's time, just take the risk."

There may be too many elements on a page, but for what you're communicating it works for me. There's a hierarchy.

architecture,3dpeqt,RealFinishes,2,Sat Jul 18 04:20:51 2015 UTC,"This is a well written and clear thesis. This is a topic that bares real discussion and debate. I will go ahead and invite /u/mies_vandelay and /u/Vitruvious as well in hopes of furthering this debate. I would also encourage people to actively engage this question critically as at it's core, when we strip away the overt criticism of 'modernism' we see an interesting question. I will rephrase to make the core question more clear.   An inherent challenge in the practice of design, such as architectural design, is the time lag between concept and execution. For the architecture and the built environment this has negative consequences (i.e. urban decay, structural failure, redundancy etc). Modernism rejects vernacular approaches to addressing these difficulties: deliberate, empirical, generational improvement. Rather modernists have promote widespread implementation of experimental designs, technologies, systems and materials.   The core question seems to be about the temporal disparity of the feedback loops and how instead of analyzing the outcome of these loops architects instead push for the flashy and new instead of making improvements on previous designs. This is a fair topic of debate and discussion.    Firstly this problem of a lack of effective and meaningful analysis and continuous iteration is a problem across multiple sectors of the design world. Software, planning, architecture. You name it and they are all suffering from a problem related to not being able to promptly close these loops and assess the impacts of a concept. This concept has generally been called a feedback loop, perform an action and examine the output and improve. A loop can be thought of as closed when a project is finished and you may analyze the operation of a product.   As it stand right now in many fields project, in say software, beings, releases and then the feedback does not arrive till half way or more through the next project cycle too late to make major modifications even on the tightest of loops. This is a common problem in my professional work and right now I am actively working to develop solutions for myself and people in my company for addressing this problem of feedback loops so this topic interests me greatly. These feedback loops are natural and as I said they exist in all places there is a fascinating discussion of this by Marc Kushner  as this relates to architecture in his TED Talk.   To begin to address the thesis directly many of the issues you have identified are not so much issues of those feedback loops, but are rather natural outcomes of time and culture. Urban decay happens as newer developments draw people away from older ones or shifts in economics, infrastructure, culture, or demographic patterns shift and in turn areas become less appealing and thus are not as frequently tended. This process depresses the value of the area further reducing investment. Structural failure is also not an effect of open feedback loops but rather the outcome of shoddy and hasty engineering work with substandard materials. This is most common in the Arab world right now and is not insomuch the fault of the architect as it is the fault of bankers pushing contractors to cut corners. Such as mixing concrete with salt water. Redundancy happens when a form is proven to work that form will be replicated. Even in places that value vernacular architecture you see a large amount of repetition and redundancy. We see far less redundancy in the built environment now than we have at any time in the past as engineered solutions allow us to not have to repeat basic infrastructure needs as often.  To address urban decay and renewal in particular for a moment. We have seen systems of urban/structural decay and renewal forever. William Coldrake addresses this in his discussion of the temples of Ise and Izumo temples in his book 'Architecture and Authority In Japan'. He points out that the Japanese frequently went through periods of imperially prescribed renewal of structures following traditional Shinto practice. From houses to temples for religious symbolic purposes of purity. This continues in modern day Japan where the life span of a home is around 27-30 years even if no longer to purify the new structure. This tradition of prescribed renewal to combat decay, something that Shinto identifies as a natural state, continues in the Japanese consciousness to some degree. In cultures in the west, such as U.S., there has never been prescription for this renewal process rather it is left up to the metaphorical market to control this process of renewal indirectly. Because of this it means that an area must fall into decay and the price of property must hit some kind of minimum before it becomes reasonable to begin a renewal process. There are of course exceptions to this rule, such as New York City, but if we look at places like Detroit, Atlanta and Washington D.C. we'll see this pattern of decay, gentrification, renewal, decline and decay again.  The Japanese, for example, took the time in each renewal cycle to refine the process of temple building. This happens currently the problem is that in architecture the conceptual design may take 2 to 5 years for the structure to go from the concept to implemented project for the public to respond to. Your stance is that somehow the modern practice of architecture is myopic to this problem. As pointed out in my mention of Marc Kushner modernists are not in fact unaware rather they are seeing and addressing this issue. This is a discussion that is just beginning as it is in many fields though and people are actively developing solutions to it.   I think that Kushner's concept is correct. Given technology we now have the ability to create, simulate, iterate and repeat. This will create a virtual feedback loop that allows architects to assess the impact of a building prior to implementation. To judge to some degree response and impact before construction. We have tools, like social media, to facilitate this. So in one way you are correct. That the lack of consideration for the feedback loop has created issues, but many of the issues you reference may have been unavoidable. Now though we have the ability to create simulations or other representations of a design to clients or the public to let them comment and then for the designer to iterate on that design. Platforms like Facebook, Twitter are empowered by advances in software like online cloud based viewers."
architecture,3dpeqt,Rhaive,2,Sun Jul 19 21:24:02 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the thoughtful post. The topic of iteration is a critical one and I think you're correct to highlight it.   I will have to disagree with you about Kushner's concept. I'm not sure how a campaign for feedback during a particular design process will extend beyond that particular campaign and and affect completely different, future, projects (and tie them together through iteration). While it MIGHT be an iterative process within a single project, I see it more as a marketing campaign for public acceptance, propaganda.   These sorts of ""public input"" methods have already been in place for generations at the urban level. Master planning usually has involved public participation as they are often invited to directly engage in public charrettes. I've been involved in a good number of public charrettes, on both sides, and I understand that its put forward as a collaboration between the private builders and the public will, but in reality, it is really just a method to appease the public and minimize backlash and resistance. I think the same thing is happening with Kushner. His 'feedback' seems only to be a method for publicizing and setting the stage for acceptance.   But even setting aside my own feelings on Kushner, the willingness for the architectural culture to take up notions of feedback still requires that the majority of architects are willing to work together toward common goals, an iteration. This is the crux of the problem because the modernist mindset is largely about personal expression (client/architect) coupled with a misguided attitude toward innovation & invention. (creativity/innovation = unique/never been done)  I'd suggest more reading on this with the book ""The Challenge of Emulation in Art and Architecture: Between Imitation and Invention  In this book, it is illustrated that the iterative process is all about a method of emulation and that innovation and invention are tied into both emulating what has come before us, but at the same time rivaling it. This cannot be forced onto a project through public voice, rather, it must be ingrained into the mindset of the artist from the beginning, rivaling (feedback) not just within their own design process, but all those that came before."

architecture,3dpeqt,mies_vandelay,3,Mon Jul 20 13:29:37 2015 UTC,"Thanks again to /u/Rhaive for taking part and reiterating the thesis in more neutral terms - I agree that this is one of the /u/RealFinishes's better theses. I also agree with /u/Vitruvious in regards to Kushner's talk: His idea of iteration does little to enhance the practice of architecture over multiple generations.  I will certainly grant the point that the traditional approach is one of 'deliberate, empirical, generational improvement.' The Modernist approach, on the other hand, celebrates greater leaps in technique and style, but I think it's a stretch to claim that Modernists do not iterate or learn from that which has come before. While I don't deny that the rate of change has increased through the era of Modernism, I think the changes in construction practices have everything to do with the broader cultural notion of technological improvement - as with most of these theses, your argument is with modernity rather than Modernist Ideology.  I'll also counter with the idea that the traditional approach (which is slow and methodical over multiple generations) is not well-suited to the contemporary condition, where the way of life of one generation can vary greatly from one to the next. Buildings that are derived from the traditional approach may stand for generations, but if they don't respond to the needs of the culture in which they are built, then they will have limited utility (and no client would ever pay for such a building).  Finally, the idea of feedback loops is an important one, and is a major missing component of architectural practice. A few clients are beginning to be willing to pay for these services, but in general the budgets are simply not there for post-occupancy evaluation that could yield future improvement. I do think that many architects are paying attention to projects in their cities (both past and present) and learning from the mistakes that have been made to avoid them in the future. This is evident in the rebound from mid-century urban renewal towards much more equitable, human-scaled, and varied urbanism that is implemented today, and we are only two generations or so removed from urban renewal. However, it remains a problem to get paid for the work of learning from and improving our product (designs) as a field when the budgets for basic project delivery are so tight.  I wonder if you can expand on the empirical methods used for improvement in the traditional approach? I don't see any reason why we couldn't use the same methods for improving contemporary architecture, but I'm not sure what you mean by this.  Also, an aside: I wonder if you read the thread about our definitions of key terms? I think these discussions might proceed a little more smoothly if you were willing to alter some of your language while maintaining the core idea of each thesis. To me, it still seems as though your ire is misdirected at 'Modernist Ideology' in an unproductive way."

This quote did not cause any ""mass divergence"", you cannot pin the evolution of modernism to a single quote. And it isn't needed to ""justify"" any ""modernist shapes"". Architects (and artists, philosophers, etc) began questioning classical dogma long before this quote from Sullivan. Adolf Loos and Peter Behrens developed their own school of thought contemporaneously to Sullivan. You are trying to apply a classical mode of thinking to modernism, which does not hold up because modernism does not rely on philosophical justifications the way that classicism does (there is no single ""Vitruvius"" who laid the framework for all modernists). The entire point of modernism was to free itself from that dogma. Consider that ""Modernism"" and ""Modernity"" are not limited to architecture. For early modern architects, the modern movement was simply opening itself up to the greater transformations that were going on at the time."

It seems to me this is just more evidence that the Modernists did not, in fact, throw out all tradition that came before.  I should probably read more Vitruvius and that will likely give me some insight into this, but it seems to me that the idea of ""form follows function"" in terms of an eagle's wing or a horse is a far cry from applying the same thinking to the design of a building. The former is the result of a naturally occurring evolution which can be observed and post-rationalized by man, but the latter is a wholly artificial process upon which man exerts his rational thought process. Likewise, nothing in my reading of your analysis indicates that a work of Modern architecture cannot comply with Classical thought or Natural principle, even if it does not look like a Classical building."
architecture,3djle2,thymed,0,Thu Jul 16 21:25:58 2015 UTC,"does that not indicate that Modern architecture is inextricably related to Classical thought?    Not really because while modernists assumed that they were following the logic of form follows function as Sullivan understood it, they were actually mistaking his core ideas and doing something completely different. The 'form follows function' that the modernists pursued disassociated it from natural bodies, which is a core anchor for Sullivan.   Many things we artificially create are imitations of nature. Scientific constructs, mathematical models, evolutionary computation, are all invented frameworks of man that seek to align with nature. This should be the same for architecture, and classically, Art too was an exploration and discovery of Nature. Our bodies were born out of Nature and we operate best surrounded by it, even artificial environments that carry Natural principles.   Much of modernism does not comply with the 'finger, palm, forearm' understanding of parts to wholes. Scaling and nested elements are mostly ignored in modernism.   Also, I will say that it is completely possible for a new architecture to be brought about that aligns with all of the Natural principles needed while also looking nothing like Classical architecture. There is no barrier to this, but such a work is not only extremely hard to produce, but also lacks many connections to existing cultures. But this architecture could stand on its own as a work of genius and completion and could be adopted by a society and that could be just fine. But there is nothing even close to that being produced today.   But luckily there already exists a pretty complete methodology of generating physical bodies that are based on Nature. It's a robust system with diverse capabilities of expression. We just have to pick it up and use it and keep building on it."

I agree that Sullivan wasn't intentionally trying to drive Modernism, but he was trying to respond with inherent form to new conditions - a line of thought that paved the way for the next steps toward a new architecture (if I can be cheeky for a moment).  And then, politically speaking, Sullivan was very vehemently against classicisim in his own way, as well.  Just look at his interactions during the design of the Columbian Exposition and his feelings about hiring New York architects who were known for classical design.  Sullivan fought heavily against Burnham's insistence on using City Beautiful principles and only played along as far as he had to to keep the commission.  Sullivan certainly has more classical decorative elements in his work than later architects would, but that doesn't mean he rejected the principles of those later movements."

I could agree with this, but other than stacking more rooms on top of each other, what new conditions have risen? We still use buildings in the same ways we always have.   When you say 'new conditions' what do you mean? Sullivan was talking about new forms, and the skyscraper was a new form in that we are just staking rooms taller and taller. He wasn't talking about the machines we put inside because the method of production is something completely different from a new form or how people function in those forms.   Again, its like any other body. We have hands and fingers and they all have a form because they are all apart of a function. What new function in architecture necessitates a machine aesthetic? And at the same time you need to recognize that a machine aesthetic inherently goes away from the humanistic/natural aesthetic."

architecture,3dj32w,snowcrocus,4,Fri Jul 17 20:31:35 2015 UTC,"There are a number of books about colonial architecture in Florida and St. Augustine if you take a peek at Amazon.  One thing to keep in mind is that houses (and other buildings) constructed prior to mechanical HVAC systems had to rely on passive heating and cooling to remain comfortable and usable. Taking a modern house and shutting off the AC, for example, will leave you darn uncomfortable because they aren't designed the same way - they're designed with the idea in mind that you will be using AC. In hot climates, there are several features that are fairly common in many parts of the world (although you probably won't see every one of them on a specific example):   high ceilings - Heat rises, and since you need a roof to keep out the sun and rain, it's going to get trapped beneath the roof/ceiling. If the ceilings are high enough, the heat will be trapped above the space that people actually occupy, so the living area will remain cooler. open plan/aligned windows and doors - This allows cross-ventilation. raised floor - Not really common in the colonial era architecture of St. Augustine (I haven't seen any examples, although the truth is there are very, very few colonial buildings still remaining, most of the ""colonial area"" was actually built in the 1930s and 1940s), but common in other forms of architecture in hot places, including other parts of Florida, it also allows better ventilation of the building. masonry walls - Depending on the materials, older buildings with massive (compared to most modern construction) masonry walls can help keep a building cooler on the interior. I don't know for sure, but I suspect it's similar to adobe in that sense. deep porches/eaves - These provide shade on the walls and help keep solar heat out of the building. Not all colonial era architecture had this sort of feature, I suspect it was more common as a balcony that shaded the wall than, say, the porches of Cracker houses. orientation - In Florida, you want the short sides of your building to be on the east and west (or to be screened from the sun in some other way) because you're getting a high solar load on those two sides. The south does to a lesser degree but the sun is at a more oblique angle when it hits the southern wall, rather than the direct beating the eastern/western walls get early and, worse, later in the day (that afternoon sun in the summer is brutal, and just nails the western wall).   If you look at Cracker architecture, there are similarities in features, although in appearance and materials the two styles are vastly different. Both are good at keeping cool in a hot climate, for all that they may seem simple at first blush. For example, I used to work at a historic site with a Cracker house, and that house was very, very good at shedding heat and keeping cool - to the point where it was usually colder in the house than outside even in the winter."
architecture,3dj32w,snowcrocus,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:33:11 2015 UTC,"Great reply, thank you.  Do you think it would still be beneficial to plan to build a home using this style, even with AC?  And regarding the high ceilings collecting the warm air, would having a couple vents up there increase the efficiency by allowing the warm air to completely leave the structure?  Thanks again. I'm going to go look for a good ""Crash Course Architecture"" video series on Youtube."
architecture,3dj32w,Ntopper,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:18:42 2015 UTC,"I don't really know on the high ceilings and AC, honestly. I know in New Orleans, a lot of the late 19th century buildings were retrofitted to accommodate AC by dropping the ceilings to an 8' height and putting the ductwork in that space. This trapped the heat in the living space, and so people would tell us about how their AC would run constantly and still not really cool the space very well. I suspect a big part of this had to do with the lack of insulation in either walls or ceiling/roof. Plus, in this area, vents are usually located high, dropping cold air into the room - you're cooling all the air, basically.  Other features, though, could definitely be useful in a house with modern mechanical systems. For example, the deep porches to shade the walls is a great feature. If you look at Cracker houses, they were traditionally oriented so the long sides were east and west (a no/no here, if you will recall), but they had long, deep porches on these sides. In the summer, the angle of the sun is higher, so it would hit the porch roof rather than the wall and help keep the house cool. In the winter, for part of the day at least, you could get a bit of sunlight on the porch or even on the wall, when a bit of extra warmth is ok. Even providing exterior shade for windows can make a big difference (awnings, various types of sun screens, etc.), since keeping the heat out before it gets through to the interior of your house is far more effective than, say, blinds, which basically reduce light but do almost nothing to keep heat out of the room."

I agree with him that London needs to become more dense (for several reasons including the housing crisis but also to prevent sprawl in order to preserve our green spaces and arable land), but building tall towers is a way to achieve this. His suggestion of 6 - 8 storey buildings is fine for suburban areas where a tower would look out of place, but in central London most of the buildings are at least this height already. More 6 - 8 storey buildings wouldn't increase the density.  A tower does have a huge visual impact but that is not necessarily a bad thing. Places like Manhattan, Shanghai, and Hong Kong are filled with tall towers and they have striking and interesting skylines. Of course they look different to London but, as Botton notes, places change and that is not something to fear.  London will (hopefully) always keep the traditional buildings we know and love but it also needs to respond to the needs of the modern world with more housing to accommodate our growing population, built to the latest standards of energy efficiency and sustainability; new towers are the way to do this."

There is no 'black vernacular' architecture. There is only black culture, and said culture vibrantly lives in apartment buildings, pueblo ranch homes, Craftsmen homes, and old Bostonians depending on where they live. The architecture that black people engage with is the same that white people engage with.

architecture,3dd9uj,RealFinishes,2,Wed Jul 15 10:53:12 2015 UTC,"I think there is a significant lineage of theory surrounding the nature of 'craft' in the world of applied arts, and I don't think most who are even remotely well-versed in this area would claim the distinction you have made above. Likewise, I don't think those in the field of 'fine arts' would claim this distinction.  This seems to be another case of projection, whereby you have absorbed a generalization from somewhere and applied it (erroneously) to the profession as a whole. You are right that this distinction defies common sense, and that is why nobody will stand by this claim. As you can see by the lack of replies, this type of 'disputation' is not a good method of starting discussion."

It has become a pillar of Enlightment thought, precursor to Modernism. Both Ruskin and Morris railed against it in the late 19th century, indicating how industrialization combined with desecration of craft as simply labour distinct from art led to the meaningless pastiche of their day. Unlike zoster Modernists their solution was to restore the place of the decorative and applied arts not dump it in the rubbish bin."
architecture,3dawzo,dream-adventurer,2,Tue Jul 14 21:22:15 2015 UTC,"There are a ton of resources online to start learning the history and modern trends of design.  Even just wikipedia browsing can open up a great wealth of information.  Start with the architecture page and just click blue links and see where it takes you, make note of the things you like or don't like, but also think about why you like or don't like something.  That's much more important than just a gut reaction - disseminating the reason or character of what makes that gut feeling.  A lot of time early in school is going to be spent trying to get you to think that way, no matter what design field you choose.  Try learning about other design fields while you're at it also.  And follow some design websites like Archdaily.  They're not going to teach you much, but it's nice to see what's going on out there and form opinions on it.    If you want to be more active, download the free version of Google Sketchup and start learning how to use it.  Start with basic masses and materials, then push on toward maybe modeling the house/apartment you live in.  Then model some crazy idea for a new house you have.    Do you take art classes?  Keep doing that, and work hard in them.  Talk to your teachers to see if any of them can teach you about design.  I wouldn't count on it, but maybe you'll get lucky!    And most of all remember to be humble.  If you lose humility, you lose the ability to learn - and that's the most important tool you'll need.  If you know a lot about sketchup and architecture history when you start college - don't be a douche to the other kids that don't know those things yet.  Architecture is as much about being able to work with other people (other architects, engineers, clients, builders) as it is about drawing Falling Water for the first time."
architecture,3dawzo,PostPostModernism,2,Tue Jul 14 22:39:11 2015 UTC,"If I have any ""wisdom"" to pass onto you it's that being an effective architect is 10% knowing things and 90% knowing the right questions to ask (some may dispute that but they like Zaha so don't listen to them). I say this because for everything I know about architecture I have at least nine follow-up questions. The first thing I learned in school is that you have to be comfortable finding your own right answer most of the time; something I think people underestimate in terms of the challenge it presents designers because in architecture your solution must be technically sound but also a creative product that you came up with all by yourself. Which is mad daunting if you think about it.  So. As a carte blanche newbie the first question you have to ask is probably something along the lines of ""what does an architect do?!!"" or ""why architecture?!?"" To answer this I suggest you start with trying to understand how a building comes together. That means understanding the means of physically constructing a building and the means of intellectually constructing a building. Note: you will also need to become comfortable with abstruse diction, more on that later How do buildings stand up? What makes a building ""good?"" No link for that one... sorry These are complicated questions with complicated answers which take a good amount of time to formulate. Patience is key because architecture is not always a very immediate process.   Going back to that thing I said I would talk about later... Abstruse diction. When you're at architecture school, or when you are reading other people's ideas about what makes a building ""good,"" you will most likely encounter a bunch of bullshit strings of text that grasp at ideas larger than what they communicate when taken at face value. I am of course referring to the writing of the great designers that preceded you. I don't know why, but architects have a tendency to wax poetic when they attempt to communicate their ideas. This puts a lot of people off and those people become PMs and spec writers.  More on that if you ask  The reason I say you shouldn't write off the bullshit when you encounter it is because that's the ten percent that you're supposed to ""know."" That is to say, that which transcends the building is what separates you from the engineers and the consultants. In clearer terms,  when you are in a good space in a good building, it is something that you feel in your gut. It's not something that can be calculated or engineered. It's poetic. It's philosophical. It's design and it's really hard to put into words - especially since architects are also known (though to a lesser degree) for being shitty at spelling.   The nature of architecture, as evidenced by the two most common perceptions of architect in the rest of people being is artistic and is good at math, is highly contradictory. You have to have a knack for technical information but you can't possibly expect yourself to know everything about it because if you could other people (engineers and consultants) wouldn't make their careers learning all the minutiae. That's the 90% of your job that's about asking questions.   Which brings me to the other thing I know for sure about architecture. You gotta either a freaky genius or a team player. When you're talking about bridging the gap between sitting in a room getting stoned at drawing pictures and getting a contractor involved there are a lot of other designers that you have to involve to make a building sustainable. This includes but is not limited to mechanical engineers, lighting designers, structural engineers, plumbing engineers and a whole host of people who are passionate about specific aspects of buildings. You need to be conscious of those things when you are formulating your ideas of architecture because if you don't you're going to have a really, really bad time. The days of narcissistic iconoclasts is over. Buildings are a team endeavor."

architecture,3d9zjd,RealFinishes,4,Tue Jul 14 17:35:18 2015 UTC,"Some suggestions on your writing. The flowery pseudo academic language, such as ""...number in space (geometry)..."", is distracting and unnecessary. Ideas are better conveyed, even in the academic environment, using basic layman's terms when possible. Be concise and direct don't try to dress ideas up in fancy verbiage. Your ideas should stand on their own without needing to be hidden in obtuse language.   Contemporary architectural education relies too heavily on methods of computational assistance (e.g. CAD tools). This reliance leaves practitioners lacking a practical understanding of the concepts of geometric harmony such as the use of points, lines, planes and symmetries in space.   This kind of language tends to make people assume you are hiding your intellectual deficiencies or failures in your argument behind obtuse language. If you have to look it up in the dictionary it must be true! Right? . You see this a lot in scientific journals when someone wants to hide bad data. I have a co-worker that describes these types of articles as ""reeking of failed academic"". I'd look at your use of language try to be more accessible and clear with your ideas.   Additionally you do not describe what you interpret as 'harmony'' in this case. Thus your argument is inscrutable and poorly defined. Do you mean geometric harmony such as ratios and geometric relationships we find pleasing? Maybe you are referring to the sacred geometries of Plato and Pythagoras? Do you mean something else all together? Being intentionally enigmatic does not help in trying to have a discourse with others. In fact all this does is make your argument seem weak and causes it to be discounted out of hand.  To address your point to some extent now that I've, possibly unfairly, excoriated your use of language. Computers pervade all fields in which drafting and exact technical drawing were important now. It's unreasonable to expect educational programs not to have adapted to this paradigm shift. The issue is not so much that a practitioner has no concept of geometric principles. To the contrary in many ways it can enhance that understanding as a computer can accurately represent even the most complex geometric relationships. It is that they understand these concepts differently. While it may be that tools such as CAD systems are not being used to their full pedagogical potential, you must admit that the fact that a machine may represent any and all three dimensional geometric relationships with ease allows for a greater emphasis and demonstration of concepts of geometric harmony. Therefore computer assistance in this realm should be seen as at the worst a neutral change if not a net positive."

These were essential prerequisite studied for an architect for hundreds of years, only fully jettisoned when Modernists commandeered academia in the 40's.   You're quite right though, after 6 or 7 years of study and having received a Masters degree, most architects have no concept of what I'm even talking about or why it might even be important."

I am afforded distance from the topic and am interested in seeing the discussion and thus want to see your ideas expressed in a way that promotes not hinders that discourse.  In bringing up The Quadrivium you are asserting that the current curriculum is in some way not robust or rounded enough. Can you expand on a point. Given that your ""number in time"" is not harmony in a geometric sense but rather in the musical context, as it is, in modern educational thought, number in application. The Quadrivium is also to be one of the five pillars of a liberal arts education, not the practical arts (i.e. engineering, architecture, medicine etc). So how is The Quadrivium relevant to modern architectural practice? How would this enhance the pedagogy of architecture education, considering it is a practical art? How do you propose integration of ideas related to the traditional craft with the sea change that is the advent of computer assisted tools?  Ultimately you are not some misunderstood genius. Rather you are making a weak set of arguments dressed up in obtuse language. You are clearly passionate about this topic and I'd encourage you to strengthen your arguments and make them clear and easily understood to a vroad and diverse audience."
architecture,3d9zjd,mies_vandelay,2,Wed Jul 15 12:00:21 2015 UTC,Very well written and thorough. Might I ask what your interest in this discussion is?
architecture,3d9zjd,Rhaive,3,Wed Jul 15 20:15:23 2015 UTC,"To put it plainly first. I enjoy witnessing intellectual debate and the challenge of the established order. It is in my opinion evolution through argument and is a fascinating and enlightening process. I think that at the core of these disputations lie a few real seeds of conversation and debate and I would like to see people engage with those core ideas and engage them critically.  To give more detail. I like to see the open exchange of ideas. I currently have no vested interest in either side and am interested in what people have to think. I like seeing people push back against the accepted status quo. I like seeing people defend the status quo. I think it is very important that people be willing to challenge and be forced to defend accepted ideas even if the outcome of that challenge is simply a reaffirmation of the methods in practice. It is important to be the most critical of the things you think the take for granted every day.  /u/RealFinishes asserts that modernism is somehow bad and represents everything wrong with architecture today. Is his thesis correct? In all likelihood no, but his ideas, however misguided and poorly communicated, do in some form bare some consideration. Such as this thesis which had it read something similar to the following may have been better received.    Contemporary architectural education relies too heavily on methods of computational assistance (e.g. CAD tools) and in so doing has eschewed traditional methods of drafting and drawing. This lack of an education in the traditional craft of drafting and drawing has left the practitioner without a practical, real world understanding of concepts of geometry and their applications.   This is a topic worth discussing as more and more programs move more and more towards topics of parametric phenomena and the application of CAD methods. We should be asking questions such as are students of architecture losing something by not learning the craft of drafting and drawing? I cannot answer this question, but it is one that has merit for debate. Maybe with the advent of all these new computer systems we are reaching a point where we don't need much more than students with basic understanding of drawing and sketching and rather need to a broader range of technical skills. On the other side of the coin would being encouraged to also sketch and create detailed hand drawings allow a return to designs that the public at large can engage with.  People feel that /u/RealFinishes is annoying largely because, for so far as I can tell, (1) he posts these all the time without providing enough time for proper consideration or debate and (2) he tries to hide behind some very flowery language that prevents his ideas from being clearly understood. He is trying to be a Martin Luther of Architecture. Some of the core ideas (not usually the ones presented) merit discussion, such as this thesis which is really a challenge to one aspect of the current architectural pedagogy. While not all or even most of these theses merit debate or consideration (such as thesis XI) some do and it is that public discourse that interests me. To see both the current, past and next generations of practitioners discuss in a public forum the shape of things and what could be improved in their opinions. These disputations COULD HAVE served as good points for the start of Socratic debate where they to be asking real questions for debate as opposed to trying to nail some ill conceived truth to the door of the cathedral."
architecture,3d9zjd,mies_vandelay,2,Wed Jul 15 20:55:39 2015 UTC,"Are students of architecture losing something by not learning the craft of drafting and drawing?   The short answer is yes, absolutely. The more knowledge one can accumulate the better. Since to add anything to a curriculum, something must be removed (assuming we don’t want to prolong an already long training) the follow up question is :  Are students better off learning to work with computers rather than traditional drawing and drafting?  I’m not sure where to start with this… With the use of computers, there is the risk (temptation) of using shortcuts that hide a lack of understanding. In short, computers might make complex tasks too easy, hence preventing real understanding. That, however, is not a problem with computers but rather a problem with humans. It would be silly to prevent the use of powerful tools because we lack the discipline to use them correctly. Furthermore, slow and tedious tasks can be very helpful and allow a greater understanding of the subject matter (for example tracing the plans of a building vs using existing CAD drawings). This simply means that it is important to know what tool best fits the task at hand. Again we then need to be able to determine when the use of a computer is helpful and when it risks leading to errors... Computers are extremely new in our world, and they are still rapidly changing how we work. I fully agree that in some cases they hinder work instead of facilitating it. This is not a reason to abandon the technology. It is a reason to carefully think about what it is we want to accomplish and what tools we need to best accomplish it.  We must also question the objective of an architecture program. What is it the students should learn? I don't know the answer, but I can say that the objective isn't to teach a student everything they must know to be an architect. The practice of architecture can be many different things and can potentially require knowledge of any field... School is much more about learning to see,think and communicate than learning to do. When I completed school I had little or no useful knowledge of drafting (either by hand or using a computer). It is during my internships that I developed those skills. Architects are expected to continue their training throughout their careers. They are responsible for acquiring the knowledge they need."

architecture,3d9zjd,voellwhiten,3,Thu Jul 16 18:09:20 2015 UTC,"Oh, who doesn't love a little debate here and there...  So let me re-iterate the statement to make sure I got it right. The current architectural schooling system relies on computer aided calculation (AutoCAD, Revit, Sketchup etc.) therefore essentially skipping (as you infer) a crucial step in this education process.  The obvious counter-argument to that would be the computer does all of the grunt work calculations for you so that visualization and practical understanding of built environment can be your main focus. But, it also further begs the question, what should an architect focus their attention on? Your statement seems to say that an architect should, maybe not place all focus on but, have a basic understanding of what makes up that curve they just sketched on a napkin.  I'm going to say that I don't think it matters. I am more of a utilitarian thinker, as long as the construction serves its purpose who cares what tools you used to make it with. That purpose could be to create a home, or cause chaos, or provide a place to work, or provide shelter for those who don't have it, or even create wonder in this world. And those tools could be a pencil and ruler or generative design from an algorithm on a computer.  One thing that my teachers always asked me, every theory class in grad school was ""who cares"". Why does your thesis statement matter to anyone else? I don't mean to turn you completely around, but that question always helped me."

architecture,3d9zjd,Rhaive,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:27:33 2015 UTC,"""You can't understand a machine until you've understood the tools of your craft"" - Walter Gropius  I'll pull one personal example for illustration. When I was running a plaster moulding and ornament atelier I would hire architects to produce my shop drawings. There was a series of tests in the hiring process. A quiz on architectural vocabulary (which all inevitably failed. Illiteracy rates are high as well). More important were requests to perform basic geometric tasks with a rule and compass: divide any given line into arbitrary equal segments, in mean and extreme ratio, an equilateral arch etc. Aside from the task itself I studied how they held the tools. This eliminated most people. Finally, a few passed on to a series of tests that pushed their understanding of three dimensional space in CAD. You have to kiss a lot of frogs to find that prince, hundreds in fact. But I couldn't mess around. I actually produce work that is held to extremely high tolerances. By batting average has to stay near 100 to stay in business.  My point is not to say that young architects are inherently incapable or less intelligent. Their Modernist education has handicapped them. Architecture is the theoretical concepts of geometry realized in physical space. Modernist education does not provide a solid basis in theory. Compass, lead and rule are the tools of the craft of architecture. Modernist education does not teach how to use the tools, mostly because the professors cannot teach what they themselves don't know."

Unlike traditional buildings which used stone and arches for strength and stability, the design was prone to failure – listing would prevent the owner from making modifications to improve the design as technology and understanding of new materials progressed, a mistake Terry said would be “extremely expensive for the owner”.

In London, is there an objective (say, geological) context that is being violated here? Or, is it just that new buildings don't look like old buildings, and get off my lawn?   Now, you might reasonably argue that these new towers aren't coalescing into a new vernacular that will someday define a new context. You might even complain that the new context is emerging on a large, skyline-level scale and is failing to really work at the street-level scale. You might also complain that towers don't provide as much density as advertised.   But saying that the entire problem is that of ""respect for context"" is the worst kind of conservatism: a knee-jerk deference to precedent, and maybe a fear of the future."
architecture,3d47ke,fiatowner,2,Wed Jul 15 03:30:38 2015 UTC,"I think you might be confusing the definition. Context doesn't just mean ""old buildings"". If it did, I'd agree with you. Context is not static, but always evolving. It's the physical manifestation of history, culture, attitude, art, business, geography, politics, and everything else that goes into creating identity for a society. Good architecture should reflect these changes while also respecting its place.    I don't think I realized the importance of this until I lived in Dubai where they're basically manufacturing culture and importing foreign architecture. The city feels soulless, like a missed opportunity to represent a people and it's bizarre and kinda sad. Of course there's the other side of the spectrum in Rome, which is basically a museum of a city, but I think London has a unique opportunity because of its proud history and also forward-thinking ambition.   All this aside, the Walkie Talkie looks like a giant cartoon monster looming over the city. From the beginning it always reminded me of the Disney character Gaston, arrogant and egotistical. The building amenities are probably sweet and the offices will have amazing views, but if you think of it as an icon in London, as an addition to one big piece of public architecture, it's almost like getting a shitty tattoo on your face. I'm a bigger fan of the Leadenhall.     Also, Kenneth Frampton puts all this better than I ever could. Check out Critical Regionalism and the work of Jorn Utzon."

architecture,3d4ied,maktub123,4,Mon Jul 13 13:33:39 2015 UTC,"The term Interior Architecture is a pretty new term that some parts of the interior design field has adopted in order to separate itself from the public's perception of interior design. In other words, interior design and interior architecture are the same thing.   Designers can do a lot more than most people think. We learn construction systems and construction documents, ADA, fire and other codes - although our ability to sign documents depends on each state in the US and I can't speak for other countries. Designers cannot touch load bearing walls without an engineer or an architect.  The scope of work designers do varies greatly depending on what kind of firm you work for. Large firms work on large projects like hospitals, airports, corporate offices, schools, libraries, government buildings, hotels, etc. Smaller firms work on smaller projects - perhaps restaurants, smaller scale retail, and small businesses. Very few designers as a proportion of the field work in the residential sector.  If you're not sure about whether you want an architecture degree or an interior design degree, please consider asking this same question to /r/interiordesign. There are plenty of students and professionals over there that can give you more perspectives. Don't be put off by all the posts asking for decorating advice - it's a perception we have to battle every day. There are a lot of previous posts over there asking about education and careers as well, so you should get some results from the search bar. A good book you could look into is Becoming an Interior Designer: Second Edition by Christine M. Piotrowski. It will give you a good overview of the profession and details about different specialties. You might also do well to look at the websites of some of the big design/architecture firms like HOK and Gensler. They showcase past projects so you can see what kind of work is being commissioned.  You asked about specialties other than commercial, so here are some of the big ones:  residential  healthcare  senior living/aging in place  institutional (schools, government)  Historic preservation and adaptive reuse  facilities management  hospitality  entertainment and recreation (theaters, casinos etc)  You can also specialize in things like acoustics, sustainability, codes and lighting design.  When looking at schools, make sure that it is CIDA accredited. After graduation and two years of work experience under a licensed designer, this will allow you to sit for the NCIDQ exam to get your own license. Some states have title legislation. This means that to call yourself an interior designer or a registered interior designer, you must have a license from the state in which you wish to practice. Other states have practice legislation. This means you cannot do the work of a designer no matter what you call yourself unless you are licensed. Most states require that you take continuing education units every year to keep your license. Whether you are licensed and the state in which you work determines what kind of drawings you can sign and what kind of construction work you can supervise.  Finally, in terms of career progression, here is a pretty good chart about your options. Scroll about a third of the way down.  Good luck on your decision and feel free to ask me any farther questions you might have. I'm still working on my degree, so I can't offer any first hand knowledge about the job market, but if you want to know more about classes and course load, I'm in the thick of that end of it!"

architecture,3d4ied,DiamineRose,2,Mon Jul 13 22:15:35 2015 UTC,"I'm not very familiar with masters programs, unfortunately. I'm not intending to get a masters in interior design so I haven't done the research. Don't be afraid of state universities. I go to a state flagship with a good masters and bachelors program. You'll save a lot on tuition that way. Look at the course maps for all the programs, too. Make sure they have plenty of studios and techincal classes (though more technical and computer program stuff is crammed into studios than you'd think).   Some schools start on computer programs earlier than others, but you should be learning hand sketching and some hand rendering, too. Reading mission statements might help you get a feel for the philosophy or specialization of the program.   You'll definitely want to go on tours for your top few. Some things to ask would be if all the professors practice/have practiced in the field. Will you have 24 hour access to studio space, the computer lab, and a printer? What kind of electives do they offer? How involved in the school with IIDA and ASID? Are there any summer abroad or other summer activities? Is there a review process to officially get into the program after taking intro classes?  This last one is common. You'll be okay if you're getting good grades.   Also make note of the general condition of the building that houses the program. I know it seems like judging a book by its cover, but you're going to be spending almost all of your time there for the next few years. I promise it will be more a home than your apartment. Are you going to be miserable living there?  Some masters are only for those with a bachelors in interior design. Those are usually MFA degrees for people that want to teach. Our masters for people with an unrelated undergrad degree is called the ""first professional"" master of science (bachelors degree is also of science).  Edit: Oh! And placement rates. What percentage of graduates are working in the filed 6 months after graduation? Ours is 100% for the grad program. Nearly 100 for undergrad, but some didn't respond and everyone who applied for a grad program somewhere got in. Don't settle for low placement rates."

Just pointing out that in the US an Interior Designer (Not sure if Interior Architect is an official title?) is distinctly different from an Architect. The former deals with interior designs, fit-outs and finishes, and some layouts, but cannot design buildings from the ground up. They cannot stamp drawings for construction that define a building's compliance with code, and as such primarily deal with cosmetic issues. Architects, on the other hand, are licensed to design and build buildings of any shape or size and be involved in all facets of the work. As such, there is sort of a limited scope for an interior designer (mostly projects where people can afford their services - either high-end residential or mid- to high-end commercial).  This may be fine for what you want to do, but you should understand the difference between the fields. A Masters in Architecture would probably also take you 3 years to complete, and get you on the path toward licensure."

The building of your own grand design home on a plot is not a fundamentally blue collar experience, that's not to say they don't deserve good architecture but at a more price concious level it is probably better to suit the architecture to the site not the user. so a developer should (!) be creating good architecture and at volume the incremental cost of architectural desgin is pretty small, at least smaller than the value add.  the bespoke nature of a one-off house always makes it a luxury item, even if that plan is bought off the shelf.

Building a house for yourself, even if it's off the shelf, is a level of luxury that even many blue-collar individuals can't necessarily afford. Though I think in this case, the kind of site-specific design we're talking about, not structural or environmental tweeks in foundation sizing or roofing types but the kind that takes advantage of site features, would not necessarily be cheap to a developer to cater towards. I think that's why most architects see standard developments as bad architecture, because they are all the same four or five designs but altered to different plots. I think this is also why there would be an appeal to a homeowner to build their own house, so that they can dictate what design, from browsing a few thousand online, might fit their chosen site best instead of paying an architect a few thousand more in commission fees.   This is a far cry from site and user specific design (I recently heard from a firm who was making really unique designs based on particularly intimate details of a client's family life), but maybe it's a suitable step down from an entirely custom design."

architecture,3d37d3,RealFinishes,7,Mon Jul 13 04:01:13 2015 UTC,"Clean is code for a sparse, minimalist design   Sure, that is one thing that 'clean' means.   bereft of craft   Craft is not equivalent to Hand-crafted. The level of care and specificity that goes into buildings with minimal detailing is quite high, as there are tight tolerances between components and little to mask any mistakes. Do you think working with steel or concrete requires less care or precision? The notion of craft is not inherent to traditional materials or techniques, it is inherent to the act of making or constructing anything. Yes, there are plenty of examples of poorly crafted Modern buildings, just as there are (or were) plenty of examples of poorly crafted Traditional buildings. The craft of creating Modern buildings is different than that of creating Traditional buildings, one must simply know what to look for to find well-crafted environments.   cleansed of ornament   To me, this is a case of a different attitude towards ornament. Yes, the Modernists abandoned traditional ornament which often came in the form of finely detailed textures, patterns, and symbols embedded in various architectural features. However, society transitioned away form finding value in these designs, and eventually architects abandoned their use altogether. Instead of relying on symbols from the past, Modernists let the buildings themselves be vessels for finding beauty in nature or mankind. Providing sparse, minimalist environments is a method by which the materials of the building and the interactions that take place within can take precedence over the building itself.    devoid of the polluting evidence of the human touch.    Some architects certainly saw humans as pests that degraded their buildings (I would wager this was true in the world of Traditional architecture as well and is not inherent to Modernism). But many actively welcomed people to inhabit their spaces, and in fact relied on them to breathe life into their buildings (in truth, human interaction with a space is the only way to do so - no building can 'automate' this). Again, Modernist structures reflect the human touch in wholly different ways than Traditional buildings, but no less so.  A product of industry, possible only with the precision of the machine.  This gets at one of the central challenges of Modernism and represents (IMO) the apogee of Modernist design: balancing the needs and desires of man with the capitalist system of production in which we live. I don't think anyone has found the ideal solution yet (and probably never will), but the idea of striving to meet the needs of society in all forms is the ultimate goal of Modernism. This is where the most interesting thinking in Modernism has occurred (and continues to occur today). It also provides a fantastic open door for the mixing of other ideas with Modern ones, but you will have the greatest success by understanding the attitudes of Modernists and what their interest in Traditional methods might be (rather than attacking the work of multiple generations of architects and academia).  *Please note that I use capital-M Modernism (just as you do) to refer specifically to the Modernist movement and ideology. This does not necessarily reflect the views of contemporary architects, or all architects of the 20th or 21st centuries."
architecture,3d37d3,burritoace,-1,Mon Jul 13 15:12:05 2015 UTC,"First of all, let me say that I largely agree with your comments on the human touch as they relate to occupation. If unclear my reference was to the making, the building of the architecture.  There is a difference, largely unrecognized by architects, between an assembler of parts, a technician (or mechanic) and a craftsman. Let's take drywall for example. Does drywall take a measure of skill? Of course. However, you can learn everything to know about drywall in a month. It's minimally skilled labor, designed as such by industry; pay scales are reflective of that. The concept of a Master Drywaller is ludicrous. Certified installers of EIFS systems like Dryvit and STO provide another example. Banal, mindless work with little opportunity for advancement. Compare this to the true craft of plaster that Modernism and Industry have sought to replace. Several lifetimes would barely scratch the surface of the breadth and depth of the trade: knowledge of binders, aggregates, how to design and extrude profile on a bench or in situ, modeling of ornament, buon fresco, scagliola, thousands of possibilities that are not just a pleasure for the occupant but rewarding for the one engaged in the work. It carries the intellectual and artistic depth to be a true passion. This is what Industry and Modernism working together are taking away from humanity. Not to mention by throwing that and other crafts away modernism has reduced the possibilities of what it itself can offer."
architecture,3d37d3,burritoace,2,Mon Jul 13 18:16:08 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure that distinction is particularly useful, though. I think with almost any trade you could find some people who only rise to the level of minimally skilled labor while others become masters of the techniques associated with the profession. For example, carpentry/woodworking, concrete, and masonry all have pretty broad ranges of 'craft' from very rough and easily constructed to challenging applications that require significant expertise. I think the same could be said for plaster: there are plenty of buildings with plaster walls and ceilings that have no decorative elements and were clearly done by someone with little experience. I admit that drywall is a bit of an anomaly, but it feels a bit like an apples-to-oranges comparison in relation to the much more general fields we have mentioned - it is a singular material and not a 'craft'.  In any case, anybody engaged in construction at any level can express their 'craft' in a variety of ways, whether it is making sure that surfaces are perfectly level or plumb, they have smooth finishes, have concealed detailing that is almost invisible, or have incredibly ornate detailing or decorative elements. The difference in these cases is simply in what part of the process a level of care is executed.   For example, let's imagine a stair. In a traditional environment, this would likely be largely constructed on site from wood, and include decorative balusters, railings, and molding. Some of these elements would be shop fabricated, but there would be a fair amount of work to make the whole thing fit together, and I imagine this could fit well into your conception of 'craft.'   On the other (Modern) hand might be a steel stair with open risers and minimal structure. This would be almost entirely shop-fabricated and then installed on site by relatively unskilled labor (I think this bit would fall into your ""assembler of parts"" category). However, the exposed steel of the stair is an unforgiving material, which must be very finely detailed, constructed, and finished for it to look good in the final construction. As such, the fabricators in the shop would have to take great care to insure that they build the stair to the proper dimensions and specifications, and avoid making any mistakes which will be clearly exposed. I think it is undeniable that the work of these welders is at the level of 'craft' as you have defined it.  The care and precision associated with crafting the material just takes place in the shop instead of on site, and this line of thinking applies to almost all the cases I can imagine. I think you need to broaden your notion of 'craft' rather than disregarding nearly the entire process by which we build today."

Screw and glue finish carpentry replaces joinery. Veneer brick and stone has displaced traditional masonry. Now this list is excited about the robots replacing people because the task is so simplified. You are right to single out stairs as a last bastion for craft. Due to the complexities of helical geometries it is all but impossible to automate, yet. However, the moment it does the craftsmen will be eliminated without a thought to the impact on them or society. All hail progress!

There used to be no difficulty in knowing whether you were in London or Paris, or which continent you were on, but many cities now resemble a mash-up between Hong Kong and Las Vegas. The second problem is the one identified by Mr Safdie: that towers are individual sculptures rather than buildings that form part of a streetscape.

If you're serious about it, I would start taking the community college courses, not just for drafting, but also Architecture and Design, if they offer it. I went to school with many community college transfers who excelled.

For me personally, I just sort of realized that we're in an age where developers don't want to spend money on buildings that add to the urban fabric, last for a long time, and take sustainability and quality of life seriously. They're just profit machines where the architect is too marginalized. I care deeply for creating amazing urban environments, but I didn't feel like I'd be able to create a meaningful contribution. It'd be one thing if the pay or hours were ok, but they usually aren't.  It's a great time if you want to create expensive houses for rich people.

The efficiency gains do not pay architects more or create better buildings, it just lowers the entry fees for developers.   In America, undamaged by war and now home to Walter Gropius and Mies van der Rohe, the percentage of the Gross National Product accounted for by civilian construction in 1950 was 11%. By 1990 its share had dropped to 7.9%. The rate of building production over the same period increased from 600 million to 3,500 million square feet per annum. This means that a 600% increase in construction volume was achieved with a 25% decrease in percent-GNP expenditure. Efficiency? Enviable ""returns to scale""? This is the viewpoint of the economist and those who do not see that the product itself has changed. Clearly we are progressively directing relatively less of our total wealth and effort to infrastructural and architectural quality. This reflects our national values directly. Over the same period, the share of the GNP represented by the banking, real estate, entertainment, and communication sectors of our economy grew in precisely the opposite direction. The conclusion? Our environment has become ever more commodified, ever more the subject of short term investment, income generation, and resale, rather than of lifelong dwelling or long-term city making.   https://www.utexas.edu/architecture/center/benedikt/articles/less.html"

It doesn't pay enough and there's too much work for the financial reward.  But that doesn't mean you shouldn't do it!  You said yourself that you like architecture and city fabric, etc.  So does that mean your only concern is that you feel your personal mental talents/desires don't line up with a ""design"" job?  Then that's absolute nonsense, and I mean that in a good way!  The strength of any architect is what they can bring to the table that's different than everyone else.  Two equally experienced architects can both bring a project to completion with success.  But what that project ends up looking like is going to depend on who those architects are.  Every notable architect has a slightly different way of approaching design.  Being ""Artistic and Mathematic"" sound like an AMAZING way to approach a building.  Maybe you don't know how those translate to a building style/design yet, but you don't have to know that today.  I've been out of school for 3-4 years now and I'm still working every day on determining how I want to design things.  There are so many options, and every one is just as viable - it takes a lot of soul searching and practice to figure it out.  Sketch at home, design stuff just for fun.  Then redesign it a year later!  Then do stuff that's not even architecture like paint for awhile, and design some more after!  Your views of how to translate what you have inside of you into a building for a client will evolve until you die.    Have you heard of Iannis Xenakis?  Check him out.  He was a designer who worked under Corbusier that made a bit of a name for himself by designing heavily with incredibly complex math.  I don't understand and could never ever design what he does, even after looking it over for a few years - and that's okay because I'm not him!  I could list off architects who love painting and visual art and use it as a basis for their design work, but honestly there are too many to really narrow down.  How about Gerrit Reitveld?  One of the preeminent artists of the De Stijl movement, and took those same principles developed for their abstract paintings and turned them into historically important 3dimensional art that also happened to be houses, or chairs, etc.  Or how about Frank Gehry, who uses incredibly complex math to do very visually stunning & sculptural projects?  Or Frank Lloyd Wright who took traditional craftsmanship art to an extreme level in his buildings, and designed amazingly beautiful windows in stained glass that captured the essence of the world around him?  Or maybe Louis Sullivan is more your style, with his use of incredible carved panels in his facades (most of which he made the prototypes for himself).    So, figure out what you want in life, first off.  Maybe architecture isn't for you really, and that's okay.  You're young enough to change at least once or twice.  If it is architecture that you think you want to do, then figure out how you want to do architecture, and do that with everything you have.  If you want something ""easy"", then architecture probably isn't it - but keep in mind too that most professions probably look easy to an outsider.  If anything is actually easy, then no one will pay you to do it.   And lastly, stop comparing yourself to others, no matter what you do.  You'll only have their highlight reel to look at, while you see every flaw in yourself.  Give yourself some credit - you made it this far already."

architecture,3cpn6c,out_of_my_mind27,2,Thu Jul 9 19:41:38 2015 UTC,"Ideally, I think you will want to work for at least two years before going back to graduate school. Not only will you understand much more about the building process and how to think about buildings, but you'll gain a tremendous amount of experience with work flows, dedication, and time management. Going back to graduate school with this sort of experience will help you out tremendously.   If you are finding that getting a job is taking too long, or doesn't seem likely in your city, go back to school.   Here's what you do: Get your butt into gear and begin your job search now. Be aggressive with the amount of effort you dedicate to finding a good job. This is the most important thing you need to be doing. At the same time, begin applying to graduate schools in cities that have good economies for architects, and at schools that fit your interests. If you find a job and get accepted to a few schools, thats a great position to be in. I'd take the job over school for now, intending to finish graduate school in two years. Many schools will retain your acceptance for a year so you can easily re-apply."
architecture,3cpn6c,Vitruvious,2,Thu Jul 9 19:48:12 2015 UTC,"Thank you very much, this was exactly my train of thought. Two years to actually learn things before Masters.  I will start applying to jobs and universities.  Good advice, thanks."
architecture,3cpn6c,shawnaroo,2,Thu Jul 9 20:00:41 2015 UTC,"I've only done work for a few different firms, and all in just one city in the US, but as far as hiring entry-level employees, none of the firms that I have worked at would've particularly cared about a masters degree over an undergrad degree. They're likely hiring you as an intern architect to do production work like drafting and modeling and maybe building the occasional physical model. If you didn't learn how to do that competently with your 5 year architecture degree, then another 2 spent in grad school probably isn't going to help much.   Architecture schools can vary significantly in how they approach the profession, and it's been over a decade since I graduated, but in my experience, there's a whole lot of stuff about the actual practice of architecture that I had to learn when I got my first job, and even if I had spent thirty more years in school, I wouldn't have picked up that knowledge. There's just massive differences between education and practice, and they'll never be the same.   So basically, 9 times out of 10, you'll be more appealing to an employer if you'd spent those two years working for a firm rather than having spent those two extra years in school.   Also worth mentioning, you might spend a few years out in the ""real world"" of architectural practice and decide that you hate it and there's no way you're going to spend the rest of your life there. Might as well find that out before you spend two more years getting educated for a career that you're not going to end up pursuing."
architecture,3cpn6c,liebemachtfrei,2,Thu Jul 9 20:10:28 2015 UTC,"That's good to know. The internship I have done was actually very close to what I did in school, but mostly because they were in a sort of ""break"" doing just easy competitions, with not much hope to actually win them. Not a lot of thought went into them. But my job  as drafter or making models was actually much easier than school. Or at least it felt that way.  I'm happy to know that having or not having a Master's doesn't count that much. I was really worried about it, so thanks for giving me a piece of mind."

(Walking around these areas late at night is feels so deserted) But when you look at all of the other neighborhoods on Manhattan, Lower East, Greenwich Village, Upper West, Upper East, ect... they are thriving neighborhoods with great life on the street, and they also happen to mostly be composed of buildings that are 7-8 stories tall.

I imagine in holland the downpipe would have to take the water well away from the house to a soak-away or even a percolation tank with overflow control. However, I assume the gravel around the house is in place to cover a 'french drain' (to avoid those horrible catch basins tight to the wall) as well as allowing water to percolate straight through the path."

You could try to do the legwork yourself with these things before you need design services, but there are firms that specialize in this type of process.  Some places to start with that are the Secretary of interior's standards: there's different ones for preservation, rehabilitation, etc. http://www.nps.gov/tps/standards.htm  I hope that helps."

architecture,3ckz6w,72Carpileup,3,Wed Jul 8 19:43:49 2015 UTC,"I'll bite.  The bedrooms are the first thing that stands out to me. Why does the smaller first floor bedroom have the bigger bed while the bigger second floor bedroom, presumably the master, have a smaller bed? There is way too little room on the first floor bedroom and way too much room on the second floor bedroom. Or is that not a bed? I cannot read that text well so please excuse me if that is not a bed. Why doesn't the wall on the second floor line up with the stair opening?   The other first thing that stands out is the deck? Whats the deal with that? Is it actually cantilevered or did you not get to placing columns yet? Are you doing anything with the space underneath? It takes up 1/3 of your building which is a lot for just a deck?   Your fireplace is another first thing that stands out to me. Is there a particular reason you have it placed on center? It takes up quite a bit of space and doesn't add much more than if you had it against an exterior wall.   Your placement of the bathroom is also odd, and the first thing I noticed. Do you want to come up the stairs and be immediately greeted by a toilet? Why is the toilet and sink spaced out horizontally instead of concentrated as one room? You can easily move the toilet and sink over next to the laundry and you'll have much more useable space.   Obviously there are a lot of other small things that you can touch on but those are the big immediate things that you could think about. Also remember that interior walls have thicknesses too, so you're really looking at less space than you think.   Overall, good on you for posting and wanting feedback. You will probably have a lot of work to do, so good luck."
architecture,3ckz6w,72Carpileup,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:33:48 2015 UTC,"Please feel free to correct me if I'm wrong, but I'm going to try and respond point by point.   The bedrooms are the first thing that stands out to me. Why does the smaller first floor bedroom have the bigger bed while the bigger second floor bedroom, presumably the master, have a smaller bed?   I guess I messed up, they're both supposed to be queen sized beds.  I've fixed it now, thanks!  Do you really think 9'8"" X 8'11"" is way too small?  And the wall does line up, maybe the screen shots are just at a funny angle.    No the deck won't be cantilevered, there will definitely be support beams.  I just didn't sketch them in because I wanted to talk to my contractor and an engineer about placement.  It's an easy thing for me to add later before construction starts.     What's wrong with having a larger deck?  it's not actually taking up any of the stem wall, it's just an external addition for BBQing and hanging out.  I put the fireplace in the center because if it was on that back wall all of the heat would go straight up through the loft cooking the upstairs and leaving the first floor much cooler.  I figure this way I can take advantage of the heat on the first floor too.    I think you may be right about the bathroom, maybe I'll have the stairs open up to the sink rather than the toilet.  That sounds much more inviting.  I do like the idea of a separate room for the toilet though, for both privacy and sanitary reasons.  This way I can shower or brush my teeth while someone else is using the bathroom.  Also that mythbusters episode about fecal bacteria all over the bathroom always stuck with me in the grossest way possible.    I did take the interior walls into consideration on the 3D model though.    Thank you so much for the detailed feedback though!  I really appreciate the insights and will certainly take them into consideration."
architecture,3ckz6w,Fergi,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:03:36 2015 UTC,"Great. Like other people have said, you're likely not going to want to place the beds in a corner. Sure it saves space and all especially with the little room you're working with, but its a real pain in the ass if you ever have more than one person sleeping in the bed.   There's really nothing wrong with small rooms, but I'd recommend you try placing some furniture around to really be able to get a feel for its size. Sometimes its hard to visualize how big or small a space is without any context.   With the bathroom, I think you can move them away from the stairs and still have a separate door for the toilet if you really wanted to on the second floor. There are washer dryer units that sit on top of each other, so you could save some space with that if you need to. With the extra space on top of the stairs you could have a closet or some storage, which I noticed is absent from your design, and you're probably going to need.   I can't really give an objective answer in regards to the deck and the fireplace. My personal inclination is that if you're working with a small building footprint, you'd want to maximize useable space by avoiding placing things dead center. Secondly, I like having couches and chairs placed around towards fireplaces. Right now that is impossible because the fireplace points towards the kitchen cabinets and anything placed around the fireplace will block access through the rest of the house. Central fireplaces work awesome as a focal point of you have a lot of room to spare, but not quite that well when you don't. As far as heating goes, naturally your second floor will be hotter than your first especially with how you have placed your windows and the canopy provided from your deck, which will have a larger impact on your temperatures unless you plan on having the fireplace burning all the time. How is the climate in Northern California? Does it get excessively cold?    As far as the deck goes, I feel that the proportions do not match the rest of the building. Your deck is half the size of the rest of the house and elevated to the second floor nonetheless. It's hard to visualize now, but I think it would look odd once it gets built, especially if the space under the deck is underutilized. The unbroken flight of stairs might not help aesthetically either. Materiality will also play a big factor in how this looks aesthetically, but anything non-conventional will obviously cost more. It might be better to just bring the deck down and make it accessible as a porch rather than from the second floor. Again, these are not really objective concerns, so if you feel that you can justify your choices and feel they are important to you, then you don't necessarily need to take these opinions into account.   Also, don't rush into building this (do not start the foundation next week)-- there's still a lot of design changes that probably will be made, not to mention engineering and utilities, and you don't want to commit to doing any construction to find out later you will need to redo it. Also get your permits first. Construction is the easy part."

Putting aside all of the other information and work involved in properly documenting a home for 1) permitting, 2) bidding and 3) construction, here's my thoughts on the design. You've got a lot of windows in the plans. You should know that there are code requirements for size and location of door/window openings in regard to fire protection, shear walls, minimum light and air requirements, emergency access and egress. You can find the requirements in the California Residential Code."

Altering your house in any way was not allowed by the home-owners association as per instructions by the architect.

I used to put in a tiny bit of brown dye to the mixture and then print a black and white image of rammed earth and put that ink-side in within the molds for a scaled rammed earth look. I've seen others use fresh b/w prints on transparency sheets for better transfer but your timing needs to be perfect in between too wet so it smudges vs it's too dry and won't come off.

architecture,3cjr4n,mies_vandelay,6,Thu Jul 9 13:23:32 2015 UTC,"With regards to your “Disputation on the Power and Efficacy of Modernism” series in general, I have the following comments:  Organisation – Your theses are disorganized, sometimes redundant or even irrelevant. They should flow and lead the reader to an overall understanding of your message; instead they confuse and obscure the message.  Scope – Chose the scope of your message. Are you discussing the foundations of philosophical thought and humanity in general or architectural style and the specific use of construction techniques and materials? Both could be discussed, but not simultaneously.  Definitions – This sort of discussion requires clear definitions. Define modernism, modern, traditional, classical, minimalism, nature, culture, technology, avant-garde, architecture, etc. These are all complex words whose definitions change widely in time and place. Without well constructed clear definitions, everyone will have a different understanding of what you are saying.  Attitude – Interesting discussions are initiated by questions, not absolute statements. By starting the discussion with such statements (previously published by yourself) you put yourself in an awkward position: you cannot revise your position without looking foolish. Inevitably, you then entrench yourself in your original position and preach regardless of the points that are brought up. I then understand that you have no interest in discussing anything; instead you want to convince others that you are right.  I find it an odd choice to mimic “Disputation on the Power and Efficacy of Indulgences” but regardless, I think you should reread them: the scope is narrow and well defined and the theses flow from one to the other and lead to a logical conclusion. Furthermore, the theses were clearly written all at once, not in groups of 10: each thesis depends on the 94 others and cannot stand alone. Finally, the call for public discussion is to discuss the whole, not each individual thesis."

On the other hand it takes a bit more time to make animation with UE (theres no render time) but the quality is somewhat lower than anything rendered..and it absolutely makes no sense to use UE for single render or two.

Actually not necessarily amazing, but as an architect you forget that everyone doesn't understand the logic of plans, elevations and sections. Renderings are great but most projects in a small firm don't have a rendering budget.   In our practice we are like %80 residential. Our bim software has an app & application that lets the client do a walk thru. It is VERY popular with the residential clients. Even small interior renovations people just find it fascinating to be in the space virtually, and move around. I think particularly with residential clients, they are investing a large portion of their wealth, or future wealth into something and it provides a sense of security of the product. A sense of security which isn't there if they don't understand 2d drawings.  BUT...First of all most clients need a few back and forth emails to just get the app installed. Secondly the controls are very simple but for people over the age of 50 its like a foreign language. Running it on a computer uses typical FPS controls, which to them is completely foreign. The cellphone app is simple yet still for people who have never moved in a 3d world.... they end up stuck in a corner or something. We always have to export the file with a series of pre-established viewpoints that they can just click thru.   If my boss or I am able to run the app in front of them it is the most successful and they are still very impressed.

It's actually not much more complex than doing a single render because the software creates the 3d interaction for you.  They may have had to do some custom programming to get it online though, I wouldn't know. As for game engines, most modern game engines like Unreal and Unity have things like collision detection built in, as long as an object is set properly.

There is a reason why a project is broken down into pre-design, schematic, design development and CD's. It's simply not practical to deliver a fully developed design in a schematic phase, or worse, before you even get the job.

As an architect you design the building and then hand off the main model to them; they set up all the materials, textures, add couches, plants, windows and whatnot in a game engine and do the actual client side walkthrough stuff.   Controls might be clunky to show an older person now, but we're basically at the age where younger clients will have played at least one game with WASD controls or an xbox controller in their lives - it'll only get more and more commonplace to have VR for games anyway.

If I had to choose an overarching idea that encompasses all of modernism, I would say it is the fundamental shift from away from ""object"" driven architecture and towards ""space"" driven architecture.  To expand a little bit, classical and pre-modern architecture was defined by the buildings themselves; objects in a field, whereas modernism begin to define the architecture by the space it organized. This leads to the functionalist, ""machine-like"" aesthetic that some may call minimalist, because the role of the architecture is, at this point, to frame spatial interactions (whether it be interior to interior or interior to exterior).   I would venture to guess that when you refer to the ""just now"", you are actually referring to contemporary architecture, which is really anything that is current or new.

Regarding object vs spatial architecture I find traditional to be effective at both. The concepts to volume, mass, light and void can be appreciated in monumental architecture across the world still. Very few traditional buildings are like the Parthenon, a house on a hill. Most towns and cities were highly compact, very few truly independent structures. Venice is a good example, use of irregular façades to mitigate sound, twisting alleys to dissipate the winter mistrals. Highly complex dependent town planning. If anything g I find the opposite promoted in Modernism, from the suburban and American dream of the independent house in the country to the starchitect 'sculptures'."

Reality is actually quite the inversion of this statement. In fact, under a classical mindset, the city is a solid out of which space is carved (piazza, squares, roads, ect), and the buildings were the remainder, and not objects. Google earth ANY town developed prior to 1700. The idea that classical architecture are objects in a field is just plainly not true and shows you've never really studied classical architecture. Only extremely seldom are the most monumental of structures standing by themselves.   Further, one of the greatest, more recent works, took place in 1959 by Saverio Muratori in his Study of the Urban History of Venice where he came to three very important conclusions.    Architectural types find their embodiment within the urban fabric The urban fabric in turn has its embodiments in the whole urban form, as a totality. He called this the ""urban organism"". The total value of urban organism can only be understood in a historical continuity.   This study was then used to understand the problems of contemporary urban planning and found one of the biggest problems of modernist city planning was, in part, the consideration of buildings as objects.   He thus showed that traditional cities work, in part, because their urban fabric was cohesive, and contemporary planning was flawed because buildings were seen as objects."

Perpetual novelty, striving for a different, eutopic future.   A sense of place and continuity is impossible to establish under such a mindset. It may be exciting for the initiated avant garde but it is quite unsettling for humanity in general. Commonly held amongst our various architectural traditions, man had always been held as the subject of architectural design, the building was to be the objective reality, an outward expression reflecting his inner, spiritual nature. In stark contrast, Modern architecture enforces the complete extinguishment of any lingering artifacts of human culture, employing a complete reversal of the traditional thought process of design. The new doctrine dictates that ""Form"" was to follow only practical ""Functions"". The building and the attendant practical efficiencies of construction usurp the position of subject, placing people as just one amongst many objects such as chairs, toilets, stairs etc. populating the structure."

In all seriousness, I think this is a similarly weak line of attack to the previous one. This is a broadly generalized claim which has a basis in your personal experience of buildings. It's fine if you believe this, but it doesn't really encourage quality discussion - it just begets a shouting match between people of differing opinion. I think claiming that Modern buildings and environments are 'sterile, cold and unfeeling' without actually visiting them is overly simplified - they may look cold but actually draw a surprising amount of life (some of the newer cities of the Netherlands or Scandinavia might be a good example of this). And I certainly don't think you can seriously make the claim that all work (I assume you are referring to things beyond architecture) done in Modern buildings (the majority of production since the 1930s or 40s) is 'stillborn.'  Among other things, 'less is more' has to do with leaving space for life to occur free of the strict rules and order of past cultures (which are related to the decorative and hierarchical elements of classicism). Classical buildings are deterministic, defining the direction of society towards some ideal case based on history. These cultures weren't necessarily interested in protecting the rights or quality of life of all segments of society, and thus are a terrible thing to strive for.

There are a lot of valid critiques of capitalism and Modernism's appropriation by capitalists, but I fail to see how your ire is getting at any of the intricacies of this relationship. And of course there are a lot more Modern buildings being built - there are far more people on the planet than there were even half a century ago (and these people want to take part in the global system of capitalism, as is their right).  Your construction of the world as Modern vs. traditional is just super reductive and tiring. To me, architectural history is much more interesting when viewed as a series of interrelated 'eras,' each of which borrows things from that which came before. I don't think Modernism is unique in this regard - it is clearly founded on many ideas that came before it. Why do you insist on constructing this dichotomy?  It does seem to me that there are a lot of interesting relationships between Arts and Crafts and Modernism worth exploring. Got any insights to share in that regard?   Of course, you totally will be blamed for the the ecological mess and cultural wasteland you will leave behind when it implodes on itself.   Finally you'll have a use for that high horse - you can ride off into the nuclear sunset with a smile upon your face, knowing you were right all along. If only we had built more classical buildings, all of this could have been avoided...  Edit to add a couple questions:   In what way does traditionalism support 'culture' that Modernism does not? If our culture is a Modern, interconnected, globalized one, how does traditional building represent us or carry the torch into the future? In what way does traditionalism solve our environmental crisis that Modernism does not? Are traditionally constructed buildings built today more energy- or resource-efficient? Are they more easily recyclable for new uses?   I can't see how traditional buildings improve on anything in either of these regards except by virtue of their being old. I'm sure you have some other insights."
architecture,3cfdl2,Vitruvious,2,Tue Jul 7 18:41:19 2015 UTC,"To me, architectural history is much more interesting when viewed as a series of interrelated 'eras,' each of which borrows things from that which came before. I don't think Modernism is unique in this regard - it is clearly founded on many ideas that came before it.    This is a modernist philosophy of history that emerged during the Enlightenment that was a huge departure from our understanding and relationship to the past. However, this simple idea fundamentally changes our understanding of creativity.   During the enlightenment a new philosphy of history emerged as historians began searching for a model of events that explains them. They came up with a linear progression of events understanding that says ""one event leads to and is responded by the events that come after it. Each new step is a progression."" Under this view to repeat ideas is a regression, and that progress occurs when new events occur that are different and unrepeating.   This understanding drastically differs from our relationship to the history of architecture in that, prior to this, the progress of architecture was not at all related to time. Timlesness of beauty persists and the progress of architecture was an exploration of beauty, or a filling in of the gaps around a central principle of beauty. New forms cared not that they came after others, but expressed ideas in a way AROUND the central ideas of nature and beauty.   Traditionally the progress of architecture was RADIAL around central principles. Modernist understandings are LINEAR based on the possession of time.    So when modernists say that their architecture reacts to history in the same way it always has, its a falsehood. Traditional architecture was never, at its core, merely a reaction, it is anchored to natural principles."
architecture,3cfdl2,burritoace,2,Tue Jul 7 19:18:49 2015 UTC,"This seems like a much more minor issue to me than you make of it. Yes, a linear conception of progress is different from a radial one, but isn't the idea that one builds on the ideas that came before in search of some ideal 'beauty' exactly the same? Duplicating an idea exactly in either framing represents stagnation, but repeating some aspects while improving others is progress in either case.  The linear sense of time also doesn't necessitate ignoring the ideas that came before, it just favors abandoning ideas that no longer have appreciable value or application. To me, a radial sense of time doesn't make sense in a world in which technology changes as fast as ours. Any given generation is experiencing a significantly different world than that before, which was not so much the case before the Enlightenment.  Maybe it's my post-Enlightenment bias, but you will have a hard time convincing me to sway from a 'this happened, which led to this, to which X reacted this way' conception of history. This is a logical way to conceive of history, and certainly seems to explain much of architectural history. I just don't see how a radial conception of history has real value in finding our way in the future.   Traditional architecture was never, at its core, merely a reaction, it is anchored to natural principles.   Does this idea of 'natural principles' ever feel like post-rationalization to you? That is my initial reaction whenever you bring this idea up, and I would hazard a guess that others feel the same way."
architecture,3cfdl2,burritoace,2,Tue Jul 7 19:35:42 2015 UTC,"It's really not a minor issue because this shift of philosophy makes great changes to what we think about creativity. how many times have you thought, or heard other say that one needs to be unique in order to be creative? This idea ONLY permeates with a linear understanding of progress. Uniqueness is now, very often, the driving force behind creativity, as seen in many comments all over this sub and in our schools.    but isn't the idea that one builds on the ideas that came before in search of some ideal 'beauty' exactly the same?   Nope. Because in the modernist tradition, old ideas have been abandoned. Full stop. They have been literally erased from our history books in most cases, and recent traditionalists like Gustavo Giovannoni or Armando Brasini were ignored and never made it into the history books. In fact, architectural history books were written as if traditional architecture actually stopped and modernism took their place. It was a wonderful piece of propaganda. The early modernists made a deliberate effort to eradicate tradition, and they succeeded.  We now life in a post-rationalized world where modernist pretend they are connected to history/culture/continuity, when they don't and arnt.   Yes, duplication might be a form of stagnation, but nobody is arguing for stagnation. Again, you are saying that to utilize historic notions and cultural forms and traditions is stagnation, when it is not. Nobody advocates for duplication, nobody advocates for copying. Emulation is not copying, not in the least.   You also need to remember that the industrial revolution occurred for over a hundred years while maintaining natural principles. The industrial revolution and the advancement and progress of tradition moved together for generations before WWII. There is nothing about steel that necessitates the abandonment of natural principle and tradition, yet you are saying modern materials mean we need to abandon classical understandings of scale and articulation. Why?   You might, logically, think that the events of history are all linked together, but I submit to you that if A precedes B, A is not necessarily the cause of B. And at the same time, if A and B develop at the same time, they may have influence each other, they may be sympathetic to each other, but they may proceed indifferent directions. This means that you can say that the progressions of architecture are linked together and that where we are at are reactions to what has come before, but I'm saying that you don't actually know that, or that those reactions constitute actual progress. Change does not equal progress. Change is change, and there is no way that you can support the idea that all change is a positive progression.    Does this idea of 'natural principles' ever feel like post-rationalization to you?   Nope. The imitation of Nature has been at the heart of classical and most traditional cultures for thousands of years. ( Read: An Explanation Of The Term Classical )   ""It is important to note why such romantic catchwords as "" originality ,"" "" imagination ,"" and "" creative "" are absent in classical criticism.""   You've been brought up in a modernist discourse so all you know how to do is view everything through this lens. I was once trapped within this lens too. It was never explained to us, our history of architecture profs never told us this was the philosophical underpinnings of their arguments. We were just placed in this world. But you should understand what a modernist philosophy is, and see how you have been molded  by it.   The Philosophical Discourse of Modernity  [Modernist tendencies include a historical objectification of rational structures, a principle of subjectivity, individual autonomy as the essence of man, and the rejection of all authority (ie natural principle and tradition)...]"
architecture,3cfdl2,disposableassassin,3,Tue Jul 7 21:15:29 2015 UTC,"how many times have you thought, or heard other say that one needs to be unique in order to be creative?   Honestly, this conception of creativity seems reductive and never really crossed my mind. However, I do think it is easier for people to wrap their heads around unique or striking ideas, and much less so to see subtle differences or improvements. This may be where this idea comes from, but I don't think this is really a valid definition for creativity except in the most uninformed circles.   old ideas have been abandoned. Full stop.   I really think this is another case of your projection. While some architects certainly made a name for themselves by aggressively abandoning tradition, they still relied on other fundamental ideas about proportion, order, etc. All the early Modernists were pretty explicit about their Classical influences, as I recall. And today, there is growing interest in relearning some traditional building techniques (those that still have value, not all of them).   recent traditionalists like Gustavo Giovannoni or Armando Brasini were ignored and never made it into the history books.   Lots of architects don't make it into the history books. Those that did are the ones that either executed a certain idea particularly well or brought about a significant shift in thinking through their work. You must understand that while the contributions of these architects may have been significant in terms of traditional building, their own cities, or a particular group of architects/planners, there were far more important things happening in the 1920s, 30s, and 40s in the world of architecture. This is not to discount their work, just to point out that there is a reason that people who were building structures that look much the same as those 100+ years old were not necessarily included in the history books. You may be able to see the value in the works of these architects, but I don't think you can expect those who are not versed or interested in traditional building to put the same value in their work.   modernist pretend they are connected to history/culture/continuity, when they don't and arnt   Aren't they connected to history/culture/continuity simply by virtue of existing? Societies and their architects decided it was time for a change, and went after it. They may represent a significant deviation from that which came before, but I don't see how they are somehow not a part of our history. I don't understand how you are able to discount swathes of history this way.   Again, you are saying that to utilize historic notions and cultural forms and traditions is stagnation, when it is not. Nobody advocates for duplication, nobody advocates for copying. Emulation is not copying, not in the least.   I'm not necessarily attacking the use of historic notions, forms, or traditions, merely pointing out that they are read the same way in a linear or radial view of history. One is either taking the knowledge of the past forward and improving upon it, or they are duplicating what has been done before and adding nothing to it. It seems to me that both conceptions of history would see this in the same way.   You also need to remember that the industrial revolution occurred for over a hundred years while maintaining natural principles. The industrial revolution and the advancement and progress of tradition moved together for generations before WWII.   But things were changing significantly in society and the built environment, sowing the seeds of further change to come. Trains were changing the way people moved, economies were changing drastically, and construction techniques were improving with new technology. For me, something like the Iron Bridge represents the beginning of the Modern era, would you claim that it follows 'natural principles?' How do you draw the distinction between Traditional and Modern? At what point did the progress of tradition end and Modernism take over?   you are saying modern materials mean we need to abandon classical understandings of scale and articulation   I'm not saying this. I'm saying it's silly to do the same things with steel and glass that we would with wood and masonry (which is exactly what happened) in a world burgeoning with new technology and opportunity.   if A precedes B, A is not necessarily the cause of B.   Of course not, but if there is ample evidence that this is the case, wouldn't it be prudent to take that into consideration? I guess you could write an alternate history of architecture in which there is a great schism at the beginning of Modernism, but it seems obvious to me that the ideas presented by Modernism came from somewhere. They were a reaction against that which came before, but these ideas were still caused by the work that preceded them. Do you think Traditional architecture was adequately solving all of societies problems before Modernism? Do you really think staying that course would have prevented the challenging situation in which we find ourselves today? That seems incredibly presumptuous to me.  Thanks for the reading recommendations, I will check them out."
architecture,3cfdl2,Vitruvious,0,Tue Jul 7 22:02:35 2015 UTC,"Lots of architects don't make it into the history books.    I would accept this notion easily if it wasn't for the fact that Giovanni made some of the most important contributions to the field. His practice paved the way for our modern understandings of preservation, and he made some of the most significant contributions in Italy. The regeneration of Rome's slums, prevented a highway being built through piazza navona, among many others. And Brasini, who's work is so bold and progressive, that he was laying the foundations of future paths of a continuous tradition of classicism. These two are by no means not up to par, somehow overshadowed by a better movement. Their being swept under the rug was a deliberate slap in the face, a blatant denial of greatness, a sacrifice for the sake of modernism. You can say they were irrelevant, but you could only be right if you're agenda was to cover up the past in order to present a more suitable context for modernism. These two architects just didn't fit the narrative the modernist propaganda machine wanted to tell. Recognizing that the modernists take over was deliberate and malicious is something all future architects need to understand and recognize. It is a history that is only now beginning to be fully understood and there are historians working on putting this story to paper. The beginnings of modernism wasn't a natural emergence, it was forced in place, and violently so.     Aren't they connected to history/culture/continuity simply by virtue of existing?    Nope. Let's frame this in a new context. Say that I move to a city that has culinary traditions of hamburgers. For generations restaurants served hamburgers, some large, some small, some places make burgers with very wild and unique ingredients, some replace the buns with ramen noodles, and some replace the meet with tofu.... yet in all of these explorations around the central principles of burgerness, the identity of a burger remains. These were not limits on creativity, or on the 'progress' of burgers, but the idea of a burger remained at the center of all burger places. But then one day a group of people said that they no longer wished to adhere to the antiquated and pastiche notions of burgerness and presented in its place dishes that in no way resembled a burger. They had meat and vegetables and leavened dough's, but looked much more like spaghetti with garlic bread, but the chefs continued to call it a burger. They begin to say things like ""our burgers are the future of burgers and are an evolution of burgers. They really are burgers because our burgers are a reaction to antiquated burgers."" So in this way, these new chefs are trying to say that their burgers are in line with the always evolving tradition of burgers, and it's change in form is simply another change like burgers have always changed. But just because these new burgers exist, does not mean they are actually apart of the tradition of burgers. These new chefs have broken tradition, ignored it, and have tried to create something completely new while still calling it a burger. So some of these chefs will say that it's mere existence proves that their burgers are linked to all the burgers that came before it, but it simply isnt so. There is no continuous thread. You cant both say I'm casting aside all previous traditions and in so doing I'm continuing it. It is not a connection to history, it is a fissure in history.    Iron Bridge   Yes, exactly. The Iron Bridge, early train stations, the gallery, the crystal palace, ect... were all continuations of tradition, rendered in modern materials, and utilizing natural principles. We both agree, these were the beginnings of new traditions. But notice that the forms, typologies, tectonics, symbols, proportions, scales, and so on, are all traceable, not only to local cultures, but to natural structure. These were built in that time when tradition was adapting to new materials, but this was all lost a couple of centuries after this bridge was built. It was lost when the modernists decided that form no longer needed to be tied to natural understandings of structure, that the principles of natural structure needed to be inverted. And indeed Corb's 5 points are an inversion. The end of tradition might not have a single point, as the take over happened over some decades, but if your interested in this transition you can read more about it here:   http://architecturehereandthere.com/2014/02/15/more-semes-on-modernist-coup-detat/ Of course, the modernists used any weapon at their disposal to convince the profession and the public of the alleged decadence and plagiarism of the traditionalists, using a vitriol in their attacks that is astonishing (and, of course, continues today)... The triumph of modernism in the U.S. was a coup d’état at the top of the academic/professional establishment that took decades to consolidate, but, it finally was – with the aid of a Stalinist repression of the remaining traditionalist firms, academies, publications, competitions, etc   .   I'm saying it's silly to do the same things with steel and glass that we would with wood and masonry (which is exactly what happened)    I agree, and exactly that was happening with projects like the Iron Bridge. But you arn't correct in saying that projects like the Iron bridge are the beginnings of modernims. Traditional and Classical architecture have always utilized the latest materials and building techniques. Advances in the engineering of materials has always been around, and it has never stopped the legacies of culture and tradition, and it didn't stop any where near when the Iron Bridge was built, it is apart of a tradition, it is apart of a culture. But todays architecture is not connected to the Iron Bridge in the same way that it was connected to what came before it. Classical architecture goes beyond materiality, and the production of new materials has no bearing on the principles of nature and classicism. Materials arrive during the manifestation of Natural Principle, it cannot affect principles. There are ideas that exist before material considerations are made. The abilities of the physical world are secondary to the notions of an imitation of nature.    Do you think Traditional architecture was adequately solving all of societies problems before Modernism?   What problems occurred that only Modernism could solve?    Do you really think staying that course would have prevented the challenging situation in which we find ourselves today?   I'm not advocating a 'staying of the course' at all. Tradition is a living thing, not a static thing. What challenges are we presented with that only Modernism can overcome?    Thanks for the reading recommendations, I will check them out. Thanks for the discussion."
architecture,3cfdl2,disposableassassin,3,Wed Jul 8 04:17:06 2015 UTC,"We clearly have quite a different attitude about all of this and I don't expect to come to an agreement, so I won't beat the dead horse much longer (E: I ended up beating the horse anyway - sorry). However, I think your analogy is a bad one. In the language of your scenario, I never claimed that the spaghetti and garlic bread were burgers (nor, I think, did the Modernists), but I do believe that both the burgers and spaghetti are part of the same food culture of that city (you claim that they are entirely unrelated, existing outside of the culture). It's clear that Modernism represents a significant shift in architectural thinking, but there are lots of theoretical lines connecting it to what came before. I don't dispute that some Modernists were aggressive in pushing their vision, but I still think it is disingenuous to claim that Modernism is all about continually throwing away what came before.  This may all hinge on one's definition of culture - to me it is purely a result of society's interaction and production. It seems your understanding is a bit different - culture is something for which society acts as a steward, carrying tradition into the future. I think this may be why I have trouble with the deterministic attitudes about culture presented here.   The Iron Bridge, early train stations, the gallery, the crystal palace, ect... were all continuations of tradition, rendered in modern materials, and utilizing natural principles. We both agree, these were the beginnings of new traditions. But notice that the forms, typologies, tectonics, symbols, proportions, scales, and so on, are all traceable, not only to local cultures, but to natural structure.   If these are traceable to things that came before, and Modernist works are traceable to these works, how are Modernist works not integral to the historical milieu?   But you arn't correct in saying that projects like the Iron bridge are the beginnings of modernims. Traditional and Classical architecture have always utilized the latest materials and building techniques. Advances in the engineering of materials has always been around, and it has never stopped the legacies of culture and tradition, and it didn't stop any where near when the Iron Bridge was built, it is apart of a tradition, it is apart of a culture. But todays architecture is not connected to the Iron Bridge in the same way that it was connected to what came before it.   It seems as though you want to have your cake and eat it, too. To me, this reflects a double standard in your thinking about Modernism and history.   Classical architecture goes beyond materiality, and the production of new materials has no bearing on the principles of nature and classicism. Materials arrive during the manifestation of Natural Principle, it cannot affect principles. There are ideas that exist before material considerations are made. The abilities of the physical world are secondary to the notions of an imitation of nature.   This may be what you believe architecture to be about, but I do not. Both views are valid, but to me this is a personal perspective on the field. For me, the construction of buildings starts with the materials (I believe this idea is a core principal of Modernism). You may think that is the wrong approach, but I don't see how you can argue that it is an invalid way to approach building. This attitude also doesn't require ignorance of tradition, context, etc, it just takes materiality (and thus tectonics) instead of historical type or form as a starting point. It certainly appeals to the logical structure of the contemporary world, which I guess is one of your arguments against it?   What problems occurred that only Modernism could solve?   I'm not saying Modernism is the only solution, just that many people felt the challenges of the 21st century demanded new solutions (you obviously disagree with their approach, but I don't see how that invalidates the idea of new approaches entirely). War and subsequent widespread destruction created a demand for rapidly constructed and affordable housing and new public spaces, the expansion of rights created a demand for new government, educational, and public buildings, changes to economies required new places to manufacture or buy and sell goods, and technology ushered in whole new typologies of buildings around travel and communication. It's possible that these could have been handled through Traditional construction, but I think it is reasonable for people to search for whole new ways of building to reflect the huge changes in their lives."
architecture,3cfdl2,Vitruvious,0,Wed Jul 8 13:08:34 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the discussion, and it will become increasingly difficult to respond effectively with a widening discussion spanning multiple topics. I absolutely agree that differing perspectives on the nature and importance of culture, heritage, and a living tradition; the understanding of Natural principles, the philosophies of history, and our goals as artists, are not, and should not, be homogeneous. While I have firm views, traditional and classical thought has never been a monolith of ideas, and it's contrasting points of view aids in the developments of culture.   I also feel that in todays world there are modernists who recognize the failings of early modernism and have begun to approach architecture and urbanism in a way that more closely aligns with humanism and the patterns we naturally undergo. While modernists might continually try to claim these reasonable approaches as their own, I'd just like to point out that many of these ideas are actually rooted in tradition and natural principle. We will probably agree that keeping in scale with an urban fabric is good, or that mixed use neighborhoods are better for a society, but these are not modernist ideas, nor are they strictly classical. They are simply a natural way of building that had been discovered thousands of years ago and became apart of a tradition of building. The point is not to say that the old way of styling a building must be maintained, rather, our proffession has spent thousands of years and countless man hours discovering the nature of building and how human beings relate to our built environment. And the traditions that arise do so because it is a propogation of knowledge. The medical fields, mathematical fields, musical fields, all have their own traditions and methods of passing on knowledge, and all of these traditions have matured into a fined grained construct of understanding. Architecture has dumped this knowledge and kept only the highlights it needed too, but I just wish to point out what we have given up in the process. Culture is important not because its a mere style of an identity, its important because culture is the way in which we transmit information.  (Somehow this turned into another rant, sorry)"

Both Traditional and Modern buildings are products of (and thus contribute to) our culture. You may not like what our culture has become, but you can't define what our culture is. You are welcome to make value judgements about what aspects of culture you like, but you cannot claim that some buildings contribute to culture while others diminish it. They are all reflective of the same culture.  I feel as though I'm beginning to understand your angle on this, which is rather disingenuous. To you, Modernism is an ideology derived from some other culture (not yours), the product of which is a scourge upon the world. Traditionalism, on the other hand, is something else (Is it ideology? It's not a style, according to /u/Vitruvious, so I'm not sure what you might call it), which supports and maintains (y)our culture. To me, this is a fundamentally flawed argument. You presume to be able to determine the value of different contributions to our culture.   It undermines and diminishes culture wherever it spreads   This can only be true if you believe that a culture based in Tradition is the goal. It may be the goal for you, but it is not necessarily the goal for the rest of us.

The content itself though is quite strong - good visual impact, layout, strong individual style, consistent typography, process documentation and (this really is last for a reason) good actual design and rendering examples. Half the battle is just good formatting, which you have down! As in: they want to see you can design not just the stuff in your portfolio, but the portfolio itself.  If anything it's a bit text-heavy at the end, but I think that's fine since you lead with strong visuals. Personally, my favorite piece is the graphic design spread though I also think the progression you show through layout/photos/diagrams in Song of Thanks is really compelling."

Imagine if he took the rigor of Berlin City Edge and applied it to Dresden.

architecture,3c5mjk,lostandfound1,3,Sun Jul 5 04:44:12 2015 UTC,"Building a desktop will get you the most bang for your buck and you can upgrade components as you go through school and your computing requirements increase. The two most important investments, I believe, are your CPU and your monitor.    Most of what you'll be doing uses CPU power.  Building Revit/Rhino models, orbiting, etc mostly uses CPU, NOT a graphics card as many people think.  Also, most rendering engines use the CPU and NOT the GPU as most people think.  You may eventually end up using GPU-based rendering engines and they tend to work extremely well and extremely fast, but you probably won't make good use of them until later in your studies.  As you build bigger, more complicated models and start requiring more computational power for running simulations, optimizations, etc, you rely on the GPU more and more but if you're starting out, you'll hardly need a discrete GPU at all.   You'll be staring at your monitor all day so you'd better get one that works well for you.  You'll want good color reproduction for working on graphics, good resolution for accurate modeling, and a wide viewing angle helps with working on dual monitors, allowing your professor to see over your shoulder, and collaborating with partners.  You'll want an IPS(In Plane Switching) monitor with as good a resolution and as large a screen as you can afford.  Now, building a desktop may seem intimidating at first but it's incredibly simple and will save you a lot of money and allow you to get the computer that suits YOUR unique needs.  Once you have your components, you pretty much just plug them all together like sticking a USB drive into your laptop, except you plug everything in on the inside of the case.  There are lots of resources on line to help you pick your components and assemble them once they've arrived.  I use pcpartpicker.com to find components for my builds.  It searches multiple websites for the best deals, and makes sure all your components are compatible with each other.  In fact, I've put together a build I think would work well for you:  PCPartPicker part list / Price breakdown by merchant    Type Item Price    CPU Intel Core i7-4790 3.6GHz Quad-Core Processor $284.99 @ SuperBiiz   Motherboard Asus Z87-A ATX LGA1150 Motherboard $79.95 @ OutletPC   Storage Samsung 850 EVO-Series 120GB 2.5"" Solid State Drive $56.37 @ Amazon   Storage Western Digital Caviar Blue 250GB 3.5"" 7200RPM Internal Hard Drive $39.29 @ Other World Computing   Case Cooler Master HAF 912 ATX Mid Tower Case $49.99 @ Newegg   Power Supply Corsair CX 500W 80+ Bronze Certified Semi-Modular ATX Power Supply $34.99 @ Newegg   Monitor Acer H236HLbid 60Hz 23.0"" Monitor $130.99 @ Best Buy    Prices include shipping, taxes, rebates, and discounts     Total (before mail-in rebates) $726.57    Mail-in rebates -$50.00    Total $676.57    Generated by PCPartPicker 2015-07-05 12:07 EDT-0400     I invested in an i7-4790 CPU for you because it has 4 cores, it has a really fast clock speed, and it allows hyperthreading.  Hyperthreading basically allows some programs to use the CPU as if it has 8 cores instead of just 4.  It's really useful for a lot of the programs I use in my architecture work.  For storage, I invested in a smallish solid state drive (SSD) and a smallish hard-drive.  You can install your OS and your commonly used programs on the SSD so that anything installed there boots insanely quick.  This is nice when you work with multiple programs in your workflow and you need to open files in different programs all at once.  The hard drive is relatively inexpensive to upgrade if you need more space and you can always send extra files to the cloud for free if you need to free up space.  You'll notice I did not select a graphics card (gpu).  I went a semester and half in grad school working on fairly complicated projects using just the CPU's built-in graphics processor and it worked totally fine.  I think you should be fine with the graphics processor that comes with the i7 CPU for a while and once you scrape together another 200-300 dollars you can buy a decent gaming-oriented GPU with plenty of CUDA cores.  (I use an NVIDIA 660-GTX)  I only got you one monitor but it's pretty decent and once you have another $130 bucks laying around I would buy another so you can get a dual monitor set up.  Anyhow, I hope this has sparked your curiosity and now you'll go out and explore the world of building pcs.  /r/buildapc and /r/buildapcforme are really fantastic resources.  EDit:  Oops I forgot to pick out RAM for you.  You'll want around 8gb to start out with probably.  You'll probably need to abandon the SSD to keep this build in your price range.  I've spent way too much time on this post and I have no idea why so I'm gonna stop typing now and get back to my life."

I7, 8+gigs of ram and 500gb + of storage is a good start. Ex gf was an architect ( I'm an engineer) and she had a top of the line Sony z series. I personally opted for a gaming laptop made by Asus. The major difference my laptop came with an additional solid state drive, bigger/better graphics card and a bigger screen but it was also heavier.   laptops allow you run dual monitors which I find to be very useful. I would keep a monitor in your studio locker and another at home.   Also take advantage of free cloud services like Google and Dropbox along with a portable external drive.

Presenting those watercolours shows that you had absolutely nothing that is better than them after all those years of schooling.  It's not about whether I'm just interested in pretty pictures.

If his portfolio was all done through computers, I'd assume that's because that's all he can do. Using different mediums allow you to think differently, and make mistakes differently, and those mistakes can be a chance to break out of the cycle that keeps you locked in your own thoughts, unable to make new discoveries.

The National Design Services Act is a federal bill that will authorize the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to establish a student loan repayment program for architects and architecture interns working at Community Design Centers.  Community Design Centers (CDCs) are nonprofit organizations that provide design services in underserved communities.  Similar programs already exist for doctors, lawyers, teachers, and veterinarians.  How does it work? Participants in the loan repayment program must sign a contract with the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development.  This contract will ensure that participants work for at least one year at a non-profit CDC.  In exchange, HUD will repay a portion of the participant’s student loan principal and interest for any commercial or government loan taken out in order to pay for an accredited Master of Architecture degree program.  The exact amount to be repaid will depend on how much money ends up being allocated to the program.  Eligible work at a CDC includes:   The design of schools, health clinics, housing, libraries, and other public facilities (except for buildings used for the general conduct of government) The development of comprehensive long-range community development plans. The development of plans for neighborhoods that are appropriate for rehabilitation or conservation activities, including neighborhoods that are blighted, deteriorated, or deteriorating. The preservation or rehabilitation of historic sites. The design, including the preparation of construction documents, of building retrofits for energy and water efficiency and conservation improvements. Assessment of the safety of structures that are in disrepair or have been damaged as the result of natural or manmade disasters. The design of improvements that remove architectural barriers which restrict the mobility of elderly individuals and individuals with disabilities. Plans for the redevelopment of traditional main streets and business districts.   What next? The bill was introduced Friday, June 26, 2015 and was referred to the House Financial Services Committee.  Now, the Financial Services Committee needs to put it on their agenda for discussion and debate.  Once that happens, they will discuss it, probably make changes, and vote on whether they think it should become a law.  If it passes the committee vote, it goes to the floor of the House of Representatives, then on to the Senate, then to the President to be signed into law.  Our biggest challenge now is to get the members of the Financial Services Committee to put it on their agenda.  Another version of this bill was introduced last year but it never made it onto committee’s agenda.  Therefore, it is vital that you contact your representative to inform him or her about the bill and ask them to support it.  You can find your representative’s contact information at house.gov  You can also show your support by liking the NDSA Facebook page and by using the hashtag #NDSA  Click here for the full bill text  Edit:  It may also help to submit this as a news tip to your local newspapers, blogs, tv stations, whatever."

If the question is whether you can switch which state NCARB sends your ARE results to, I wouldn't see why not but it's a question for NCARB. NCARB doesn't send anything until you're done. The only rub I'd anticipate is if you wanted to switch to California which requires an additional test and (I believe) doles out their own testing #."
architecture,3bzph7,BrixtonGun,2,Fri Jul 3 13:54:36 2015 UTC,"I'm fairly certain most jurisdictions allow you to take their corresponding exam anywhere else. First, you have to request your eligibility to test from the local board (NY?) via your NCARB record online. At that point, you can indicate which state you want to be your initial registration. After that, you can take the exams anywhere. Per NCARB's site: ""Candidates may take the ARE divisions in any order, and at any time and Prometric location they choose (subject to availability).""  The only other issue could be a residency requirement, i.e. does the state require you to be a resident to get licensed there? Again, checking NCARB, it looks like NY doesn't, so you should be able to take the exams in NC."

For instance, Texas requires three years of good standing for a candidate who is currently licensed in a different state, meaning that you would have to wait three years after obtaining your initial license in another state before you can apply for reciprocity in Texas.  It appears that you must have an NCARB Certificate to apply for reciprocity in North Carolina. http://www.ncbarch.org/forms/reciprocity_by_NCARB_application.pdf  This is something you would obtain after getting through the exams and involves fees, etc. but has been said to make the transition process smoother from state to state.  Another option is to simply test in NYC and have your results sent to the North Carolina Jurisdiction, assuming you do feel that you will move there in the time it takes you to complete your exams."

architecture,3c0nui,RealFinishes,5,Fri Jul 3 18:13:09 2015 UTC,"saying it should be locational, not temporal, is a false dichotomy. It should be both and neither is mutually exclusive.  The main advantage of using local materials and customs is that it provides a mechanism by which coherence and continuity can be developed across an urban canvas (and hence refinement of taste and subtley impossible in inchoherent environment).  However  other mechanisms could be emplyed to acheive the same goal.  External influences are also not entirely undesirable, if they were then only greece would have doric columns. and there would be no gothic cathedrals.   We should not underestimate the influence of traveling artizans and the human ability to share learning, and techniques.  Just being local for it's own sake, is just a warm-fuzzy-feeling argument,  WHY should it be local, and what does being local give the architecture? What are the effects of locality.. these are important, not the vaguely hippy notion that you know, we all come from the earth man."
architecture,3c0nui,mralistair,-1,Fri Jul 3 20:43:22 2015 UTC,"Where to begin? Perhaps a clarification of your interpretation of my thesis. Primary does not denote exclusivity. To the contrary, it implies secondary, tertiary considerations.   As with many principles of traditional architecture, Modernism willfully inverts the hierarchy. i.e. Mies van der Rohe in his ID Merger speech speaks of ""Architecture depends on its time"" and ""Architecture as a true symbol of our time"" he is purposefully subjugating the genius locus principle of Classicism and the Beaux Arts specifically to a lesser consideration.   So Modernism marries itself to rapidly changing technology adopting an International Style which is in fact an extranational style, having no cultural associations with any culture, nation or people placing Western civilization in an architectural 'utopia', a built environment of 'no place' in particular. Schools look like offices, look like hospitals and the same from Dubai to Dublin."

architecture,3c0nui,DrBibby,-1,Mon Jul 6 08:10:41 2015 UTC,"Not an answer you liked...  Of course Modernism responds to context, especially traditional context. It even has a name for it: contrast and juxtaposition   'Juxta' from the Latin root meaning to 'approach, join together', in the sense of violent conflict, ""jousting"" or rape, ""jostle"". So the prevailing theory goes that by placing aggressive contrasts together of Modern and traditional architecture it helps the traditional to 'pop' visually so we can appreciate it more."

Yes, the architect wants his building to look good, but he has to remember that it is supposed to fit into the urban area, and if every building was as visually busy as this building, the urban area would look just like a clusterfuck."
