catsonglass,3dw1zx,guspolly,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:31:11 2015 UTC,"Imgur mirror: http://i.imgur.com/zccVsxM.jpg  More information: https://www.tinykittens.com  Original caption:  « Junebug and Cricket were born to a feral mama who was in foster care with us for 37 days. We learned so much observing Sloaney and her babies, and are documenting our adventures in fostering pregnant feral cats at http://tinykittens.com/ferals/fostering  We trapped mama Sloane right before she gave birth so she could have her babies in a safe environment, and so we could guarantee mom and babies would all be spayed and neutered.   A staggering 75% of kittens born outside don't survive longer than six months because of disease, predators and cruelty. We wanted to give Sloaney's babies the best possible chance at survival, and are thrilled to report that all four are thriving, super snugglers, and preparing to go to their forever homes this Friday.  Our new feral mama-to-be is Sisko, likely due in a week or two (it's pretty difficult to tell for sure). You can watch her LIVE 24/7 at https://livestream.com/tinykittens/sisko.   I'm sharing her experience hoping we can all gain a greater understanding of how to care more compassionately for pregnant feral cats.   If you decide to watch, please keep in mind that Sisko is feral -- essentially a wild animal -- and therefore the experience watching her will be much different than watching one of our tame mama cats. »"

catsonglass,2okqim,Cageweek,1 point,Mon Dec 8 07:16:39 2014 UTC,"It's just one I keep up with, the rest I'm not subscribed to or barely even go into. 16 subreddits total, 1 of them nsfw and 6 about cats. How many subreddits do you keep up with?"
catsonglass,2okqim,alittlewood,0,Mon Dec 8 10:21:13 2014 UTC,"You post more than you comment, which seems utterly ridiculous to me. Whenever I post something I'm overly aware of the rules and try to avoid stigmas like karma whoring, because I'm om here for the fun stuff. I try to commit myself to OC, too.  You're just the first person I've seen this which I've heard of. As of how many subs I follow? Maybe ~20+, at least."
catsonglass,2okqim,TheRocketDog,2,Mon Dec 8 13:10:54 2014 UTC,"I can't argue with the first, I just checked and my last 200 comments was in 26 days and the last 200 posts was in 7 days. Most of the posts are double or triple posted to relevant subreddits though, so the amount of different posts would be closer to 75 in 7 days. I've also started doing that fairly recently, up until some weeks ago there was barely any crossposting, and half a year ago I posted even less to the one NSFW subreddit I'm subscribed to.  I used to be active on a different forum where I had 44000 comments in something like 4 years, but I had barely posted any threads at all. I still liked reading and commenting on threads, but I also realized that if everyone made threads as rarely as me there would be nothing to comment on. So there needs to be someone to post content regularly.  Karma is just a way of keeping score (test your wit vs test your luck), and some people prefer commenting and others prefer posting links. I'd guess that you like it when one of your comments get upvotes, that means lots of people saw and approved of what you wrote. I'm the same way with links, and you comment about as often as I link so we have different areas where we direct our focus.  When it comes to karma whoring, I don't care that much about it. For some, if they see something was posted 3 years earlier in a tiny subreddit and karmadecay finds it, then you're a karmawhore for posting it in a different subreddit. For them it's things get posted once on reddit and that's it, no one that joined after that time or are subscribed to different subreddits are allowed to see it, which I find stupid. Some people go to great lengths to tell people not to enjoy something they've seen before, and I think they are poisonous (and also breaking reddiquette).   I prefer to stay somewhere in between. Most of the time I'll check Karmadecay to see if it has been posted before, and if it has been posted in that same subreddit in the last 6 months then I won't post it. I'll also try my best to make a fun/descriptive title myself instead of going for the same one that was used the last 3 times. However I have been lazy with using karmadecay after the right click plugin search stopped working in the browser I'm using.  Then there's levels of karmawhoring where I won't go. Like pretending that I am the original creator of something when I'm not, or going to the top posts in a subreddit and just reposting it with the same title. Even titles like ""this is my favourite"" or ""this made me join reddit"" I stay away from because I think they're lame and unimaginative.  You just do what you think is fair and act accordingly. And remember that reddiquette doesn't explicitly tell people not to repost (it encourages crossposting or reposting if you think you can do better/reach more), but it does explicitly tell people not to complain about reposts."
