Secondly, it isn't really his baby, is it? He's just donated a random combination of 23 chromosomes, he won't be raising it, or loving it or even have any awareness if his sperm is ever used.  Finally, it's his sperm and his body. You of course have every right to feel uneasy about it, but at the end of the day, it's his body and his decision. You can tell him how you feel about it but ultimately he can choose to carry on."

As his girlfriend, you're entitled to voice your opinion to him once or twice and let him know why you feel the way you do, but you also have to respect his decision at the end of the day.  If you two were married it would be another story, but being at the point in your lives and relationship that you've indicated (young, not extremely serious), he gets to make the final decision."

She came to you for advice or someone to listen while she vented, and you basically gave her ""well, you shouldn't have done this thing you've already done & can't undo now."" It's true.

askwomenadvice,3e3xhq,playa2,4,Wed Jul 22 03:14:03 2015 UTC,"Is there a reason she went to you for advice? Because you just seem more hurtful than helpful. There may be a mistake in her approach - like, just because she is clear about terms doesn't mean that she can trust her partners to be responsible or respectful. Especially because it is a casual relationship, she may be rushing into these relationships. It is a bad idea to mix with coworkers, but instead of empathizing with her and helping her see how she can play it safer in the future - your response is essentially 'Wtf did you expect to happen?' I get you are trying to be real with her, but you do it like a slap to the face. Difficult to not feel bad when someone does that, and potentially reinforces shame that others might be pushing on her. She is getting treated differently at work and after asking you about it, you do the equivalent of rubbing her nose in it.  It is naive to assume that it wouldn't mess with the dynamic. Especially when there is still a social and cultural disparity between how men and women are treated and what happens with their reputation. She had already made some commentary on being treated differently because she is a woman - but you kind of, maybe totally, dismiss that. Regardless, it is risky for anyone to mix company ink.... and you could have communicated that and approached the subject a lot better. But maybe you were the wrong person to ask and this is an example of how, despite being careful, she could be tentative about other things which she currently isn't. You can't deliver catharsis by making someone feel more like shit though. You don't shame her yourself, but the way you make her feel will echo how she feels when she is shamed."

askwomenadvice,3e54sq,petethepianist,12,Wed Jul 22 01:01:48 2015 UTC,"It depends on your fiance. The other comments are saying if she loves you, she'll be happy to wear them. I think that's bad advice. It's the difference between she loves you/loves the rings and she loves you/she'll wear it out of obligation even if she doesn't like it. Your mother's memory should have a place in your lives, but the marriage between you two should be your own. She has to wear her ring for the rest of her life, so it should be something she likes and something that has sentimental to her. It may not be her style (the rings are a bit dated btw) and you would not be making the gesture of picking out something specifically for her. You'd be asking her to honor your mother for one of the biggest events of HER life. She might love the idea. But if she doesn't, she can't say no to the ring without being rude or coming off as materialistic. I suggest proposing without a ring and then discussing the ring later. Show her the rings, give her a real choice, and pick out a new ring together if that's what she wants."
askwomenadvice,3e54sq,SalamandrAttackForce,3,Wed Jul 22 04:04:38 2015 UTC,"I second this. If she doesn't like the style of the rings or the yellow gold, you could always have the diamonds put into new settings of her choice, something that would make the rings quite special to both of you."
askwomenadvice,3e54sq,Amphibology29,4,Wed Jul 22 09:57:57 2015 UTC,"I understand the rings have a great sentimental value to you. I think a beautiful gesture would be to design a ring with your soon-to-be fianc√© using the diamonds from your mothers rings.  It's like keeping your mom with you guys always, just changing around the setting for what works for you.  Showing your new wife that her tastes are important, but also giving your mother a special place.  I hope your girlfriend appreciates how much it means for you to present her with this kind of gift! Best of luck! ...also someone commented about discussing marriage before proposing--definitely do this! You should be sure she will say yes before taking this leap :)"
askwomenadvice,3e54sq,JattiG,3,Wed Jul 22 06:48:34 2015 UTC,"No, its not bad taste at all. You should totally figure out a way to use a ring that means so much to you. I would pull one of her friends/sister aside and ask them for advice. Or I would just try to bring the conversation around to engagement rings and mention that you have your moms and its special and see how she handles that. If she loves you, and she should, she wouldn't judge you for wanting that. Especially if you decide to go with the main diamond or a different setting."
askwomenadvice,3e54sq,hoodlummer,5,Wed Jul 22 01:14:15 2015 UTC,"My fiance gave me his grandmother's ring and I love it. I can't get your ring to load, so I can't see it, but I'm sure it's lovely. Here's what I would do. Give her the engagement ring when you propose. Give her the wedding band at the actual wedding (That's what it's for). Give her the anniversary ring on your 1st wedding anniversary.  Proposing tips - you shouldn't be proposing yet if you guys have never discussed marriage. If you don't know if she'll say yes, you probably need to have a conversation.  Don't do anything in public or over the top (unless she has specifically said she wants that. Recently.) Pick a place that is special to the two of you. Don't put any rings in any kind of food. If you feel like doing the down on one knee, or you think she wants you to, go for it.

Because that is an immature, ridiculous reason. Without knowing anything else about you, it actually makes me question you as a partner a little bit.  Now if it was genuinely related to health, like you have a blanket policy of asking all partners to get tested regardless, that's not ridiculous. Plenty of people have that.

I think you should do some self-examination, because this is bound to leak into your relationships.   Again, if you are honestly concerned with your health, ask her to take to the test. If it's a dealbreaker for you, let her know it's a dealbreaker.

askwomenadvice,3e2rm0,VeronicaToxic,5,Tue Jul 21 14:47:42 2015 UTC,"i have a similar background to you.     i think your concerns are fair and there's really maybe only two ways to find out. the first is to talk it out back and forth with this guy as much as you can before engaging in the actual sex part. tell him how you feel, and how it worries you a little bit, ask him what he thinks. the more you guys can talk about it the more it's likely you'll be reassured. or hey, maybe you'll suddenly realize that this is NOT for you, which is totally ok. if this guy is a standup guy, he'll respect that choice. if he doesn't then you dodged a bullet. sex doesn't ruin friendships -- false expectations and lack of communication ruins friendships. if you both walking expecting two different outcomes is where you'll run into a problem. if you're both really JUST about the sex - then have at it!  i know for me the thing that made the difference is that even though my sex partners (including my first) were on the casual side, i was always careful to choose men who would treat me and the connection that we shared with a certain amount of respect. because ultimately sex is a very unique kind of intimate connection, and it doesn't stop being that just because it's casual. that said, casual opens up a certain amount of playfulness and adventure and discovery and...relaxation (the stakes are pretty low) that i have found actually allow for relationships (even if they're just great friendships) to blossom. casual sex is also great practice, because you'll learn more about pleasing yourself and pleasing others -- knowledge that can never hurt when going into a new relationship.    the second best way to find out is to just go for it. if you end up not feeling good about it, i think you'll recover. it's like skydiving right? some people go once and they really enjoy it and want to do it again, others go once and are terrified and pee their pants or whatever and realize that it really is NOT for them AT ALL, and there are still others who don't even have to go skydiving to realize it's not something they're going to enjoy. there's no shame in either one of those scenarios.    please lemme know if you have more questions. best of luck!"

I've kissed guys (and girls) when drunk to make someone else jealous. I've done it because I was desperately lonely and the alcohol made me not really care who I was with. And I've done it because I liked a guy and didn't have the courage to kiss him sober. There's no way to know what she was feeling."

Clitoral orgasms are more common, but if she's tried clitoral stimulation and not gravitated toward that, it may just not be her thing. She's orgasming and enjoying sex, so what exactly are you aiming for here?"
askwomenadvice,3e3oo4,wobblebase,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:36:53 2015 UTC,I think that enjoying sex is more than orgasming - though its great.  I think the fact that she can't describe what makes her feel good inhibits a completely pleasurable experience.
askwomenadvice,3e3oo4,wobblebase,4,Tue Jul 21 23:00:04 2015 UTC,"So is the sex good, or is she not actually finding things that feel good? I mean if the mechanics are fine and the issue is communication, then trying new mechanics won't fix that. Or if the issue is that you want to try new things then suggest them and ask her what new things she actually wants to try.   Overall, I'm still unclear on what you're aiming for here. My sense is that you have this idea of how sex is supposed to go, or that certain things (clitoral stimulation, vibrators) are supposed to be amazing for women. And that's just not the case - it's an individual thing."
askwomenadvice,3e3oo4,sextarts,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:07:43 2015 UTC,I think he just wants her to explore more. A lot of women don't really do enough personal exploring and are left not really knowing what they really want in the bedroom. Sure you can discover stuff as a couple but it's important for woman to know themselves so they can better guide their partner. That being said if she is happy and doesn't want to change things then maybe everything is good for her as is and nothing needs to be changed.

askwomenadvice,3e14lm,ronniejean1,2,Tue Jul 21 17:07:51 2015 UTC,"No. I'm telling you ending the friendship is a good idea for both of you, but mainly you if you can't accept her lack of interest. It hurts to be rejected, and it's hard to be around them. I wouldn't blame anyone if they didn't think they could handle being around their love interest, you have to look out for your own feelings.  Plus, I've been on the end of having a friend crushing hardcore on me and telling him multiple times I had no interest. He kept hanging around me, telling everyone he loved me, and in turn, everyone would tell me i should give him a chance. It got really annoying, to the point where I told him I couldn't hang around him if he kept it up because I didn't like the pressure from him or his friends. He was ok for awhile then it started up again so I had to distance myself from that friendship."
askwomenadvice,3e14lm,localgyro,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:23:52 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the advice, I am going to try and avoid talking to her for 2 to 4 weeks to try and get it out of my system. I feel like it might not be possible though because the reason why I am attracted to her is that she is a really great friend.    you have to look out for your own feelings.    This is probably some of the best advice I have received so far. I would feel like a piece of shit if I left her. She has issues with depression and abandonment and I feel like leaving her would only make it worse.

It's not anything specific, just a lack of the chemistry that makes you want to kiss a person rather than just hang out with them.  It's great that you felt you could open up and be safe with her -- but that's something that many of us do with friends, not just with romantic partners.  Just to make this clear.  If there's any friendzoning going on here, you're doing it to yourself.  She's been very clear about how she feels about you.  If you don't like that, then it's up to you to move on."

He was 24 iirc and constantly made excuses for not having his life together. He worked part-time on and off, mostly off. He was constantly broke and could never do anything. Wasn't going to school, just sat around and played videogames and smoked weed and complained that everything was so difficult.  Maybe he was depressed, maybe things really were that difficult for him, whatever. Ultimately, though, he wasn't making any effort to improve his life, and I was growing up and had stuff to do.  You're twenty and this guy is twenty-seven. He's had seven years longer than you've had to start a career or go to school or develop skills.

That's his battle that he'll have to fight - you cannot fight it for him. Having grown up in the middle class, you can't even understand it. It seems easy. Get a job, save money, buy car, go to college. You have a lot of advantages that you don't even notice. Whereas when he gets handed an advantage, he doesn't even recognize it for what it is, or take advantage of it because he doesn't know how.   He can get out of this rut.

Some people do need a push to get their act together, but if it's all you talk about, it gets tiresome and both of you will end up sour over it.  Last, I would be highly offended if someone asked for proof of acceptance of anything. If you don't trust him, I don't think you should be with him.

askwomenadvice,3dy8h6,Svataben,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:27:42 2015 UTC,"Have you tried...asking her?    Sex drives change over time, and as companionate love deepens it's normal for the sexual feelings or intimacy to become eclipsed. All you need to do is tell her you've noticed your relationship with her is lacking the physical intimacy, tell her that you miss it, and ask her if there's something you guys can work on to bring it back. Maybe she's changed up her medication or has been dealing with a lot of stress at work. If that's the case sometimes it's better to ride out the dry spell until things are easier or medications change than to try to force it. If she's just bored with your sex life together, then it's time for you guys to start spicing things up with romantic dates or by trying out whatever fantasies or kinks you've each always wanted to explore.    Finally, a word of warning: it's great that you're doing all these nice things for her, but these are nice things you should be doing for each other all the time. They're not coins you put into the sex machine every time she stops putting out. It's possible that she's been feeling very neglected by you, and now that she's cooled off her behavior towards you, she's afraid to warm up to you again because you'll start taking her for granted again. So you need to turn over a new leaf here and ALWAYS be this attentive, not just when you want to have sex or intimacy. She needs to know you value her, and that you'll always treat her well because you love her-- not because you want something in exchange for your efforts."

I noticed we are not attentive to each other so my goal was to take the first step in hopes that it would result in her feeling better in the relationship and being the same.  Obviously the things I do are having an affect but I don't want her to always fear ""reacting"" to them.  She doesn't want to ""overreact"" in fear of making me feel awkward.  Does that mean she doesn't want to overreact in a way that I stop?  I mean what does that mean?

This just makes me think that she has poor cooking and planning management. Most meals don't require constant attention - it can save a lot of time to wash one pan or one cutting board in between stirring whatever is on the stove.  Anyway. Regardless, try working out a system that doesn't require you to spend such a long time cleaning at night? That could be simpler meals, or even just scrubbing the food off all the dishes and leaving them stacked in the sink overnight so you can properly wash them at a later time."
askwomenadvice,3dwzig,thunderling,4,Mon Jul 20 08:17:32 2015 UTC,"you need to change the setup. Look, living together shouldn't be completely about what is equally ""fair"" but what works for both people. My original setup was that we would split cooking dinner (I cook one night, they get the other night). We would split dish washing duties, vacuuming duties, etc. It just didn't work- on my nights of cooking, it would be an hour long prep meal. Her nights? fucking cereal. So what ended up happening is this: I cook dinner every night. Not always elaborate. We split dishwashing duties. Basically, who ever feels like doing it first. She does all of the vacuuming. I do all of the dusting. How did we change the setup? Honestly, lots of fighting. Fairly. We both realized that if we wanted something done or we prioritized something (like a good dinner every night, or the floors vacuumed once a week), we had to be the ones to do it. The same is true here. If she is a foody and wants to cook a 20 pot meal, let her. But you shouldn't have to clean up for her. You should, however, find another way to contribute."

askwomenadvice,3dwzig,Mittenflap,1 point,Mon Jul 20 09:04:37 2015 UTC,"One - some people like a clean kitchen. I can't eat if the food has been cooked in a dirty kitchen. That doesn't make her 'ocd' (which btw is a mental illness not a personality descriptor), it's just a trait. You could helpfully send her recipes for one-pot meals and ask if she thinks she could make one for dinner. Just don't mention its for cutting down on the washing up.  Two - that's not her problem, tho if she's actually saying you're lazy in a mean way that's a bit much. It's literally just a life issue that would exist with or without her though - if you have bacon in the morning at some point you will have to wash those dishes. I guess she'd just prefer to do it sooner. It's like a 5 min job if you do it while nothing is dried on so not really a big deal.  Three - Why don't you offer to cook with her some days? She could teach you stuff (you said you FEEL belittled not that she makes belittling comments which suggests that point three is an issue with your self esteem, not her manner), and then you can do the washing up together too. I find boring stuff like that goes much faster if me and my SO do it together.   General tip - if you both work full time, you should be spending the same amount of time on your feet doing boring chores as she does. So if she's up making dinner for 30-40 minutes, doing the washing up and wiping the surfaces shouldn't be a big deal in the same amount of time. Watch your division of labour, because very often it becomes skewed in favour of the man. That's something we've worked really hard to avoid and now if either of us is doing chores and hears the other person sit down, we shout 'whatcha doing? Can you take the bins out/pick up the cat poop/sweep the floor?' etc. etc. Also don't say OCD when you mean 'clean and tidy'. It's kind of unfair to people who actually have OCD."

The fact that she suggests getting together with other people means nothing, other than she's not embarrassed to be seen with you in front of her friends, and she's probably not planning to have sex  with you that night."
askwomenadvice,3dvm7q,localgyro,3,Sun Jul 19 22:17:14 2015 UTC,"it's possible she's just not that into you or  was into you seeing you again but then changed her mind.     it's unclear to me whether she invited you to hang out with her best friend + your mutual friend, or whether her best friend is her mutual friend. if it's the former, then it's possible she wanted to see you but had made a commitment to hanging out with her best friend or something so that's why she wanted to do a group thing. or maybe she feels more comfortable in group settings. or maybe she really wants her best friend to meet you.     we can speculate about what's going on all day, but ultimately i think the best thing to do is to be upfront and ask her. Saying something like ""Hey, would you still like to go on that 2nd date sometime? It's ok if you've changed your mind"" will allow her to be clear about her intentions with you without worrying about you acting out if she says she's no longer interested. Women can are afraid about being direct when turning somebody down because very often the guy will react angrily or will engage in clingy behavior. By telling her it's ok if she's not interested, you're letting her know implicitly that you're not going to be that guy, so there'll be more room for a straightforward answer. Obviously, if she does say no, which she might not, your job is to not be that guy. Learning to accept a rejection gracefully is a very valuable skill for both men and women, so get into that practice now if you haven't already.    ultimately you deserve a girl who will clearly and enthusiastically say yes to going out with you. if she can't give you one even after you've given her the space to do so (or to say no), then my best advice is to move on and stop wasting your time.     whom she friend zoned before     this is not a real thing. please stop pretending it's a real thing."

And I mean, technically I approached. She came to me, asked me for a product, I couldn't find it. I found it after, I brought her to it, and I'm the one who furthered the conversation. So I guess I did. But anyway, thank you for the input! It was really interesting!"
askwomenadvice,3du3jj,tway104,8,Sun Jul 19 14:06:51 2015 UTC,"Talking about fantasies ahead of time is always a good tactic. Asking her about hers. It's also best to somewhat ease someone into your fantasies. A lot of people would be cool with discussing a blindfold in the bedroom, but jumping straight to wanting a full on latex suit, hood, and spanking bench would be a it jarring.  Point being, don't just have one conversation but many over time and adjust the depth of your fantasy reveals based on your partners response.   Another way to talk about them is to read about them and the discuss afterwards. Not 50 shades shit, but actual good quality erotica. Violet Blue has some collections for couples that are very good. You could both read them and then talk about which ones you found hot and which ones did nothing for you."

You could just come home and be like ""I saw this at Target and thought it might be fun to try"". But if it's a scat fetish... well good luck.  To talk about it though, I would think she would be more receptive after a romantic date with just a small bit of alcohol. Then just ask her if she's had any sexual fantasies she would like to try out. Then she will most likely as you about yours. But once again, if it is too crazy, it might not go well."

My husband only wants to fuck my tits or cum on them after watching porn, and I noticed the same pattern in past relationships. So there's that.   As for being woken with a blow job, my husband told me once that it was his teenage fantasy, and I obliged when the timing was right, but he sweats a lot when he sleeps and it was pretty gross down there at the moment. All warm and moist and musky, so I have not done it again, but I have woken him with sex instead. Depends on you, but that makes him just as happy."

In our case we ended up having a falling out that I won't get into here and that ended it for us, really, although we parted awkward ways rather than angry so the bridge wasn't totally burned.   In your case it sounds like the long goodbye could be helpful. Just start getting busy when they call you all of a sudden. Stretch once a week into once every two weeks, then once a month, and so on. They'll either get the hint or they'll confront you. If they confront you, you can either admit that you see your interests and lives going different ways, or you can say you wanted to cut down on your partying. Be warned though, if you use that excuse they may suggest hanging out sober which would put you back at square one.

If a date isn't opening up over the course of months (if not weeks) I personally wouldn't feel like the relationship is going anywhere.

But, and I know because I was one of them before getting married, unicorns exist and fuck me if they're not every bit as finicky as you would think a magical, horned horse of that kind of rarity would be. There are a lot of women out there who, my impression is, they get shy, or think it is going to be awkward, or even that the couple interested in meeting is going to be trying to make it happen that night. A happy, healthy, couple who wants to try adding a third is not going to just rush into it. Actual dating should be involved, hanging out, getting to know the woman better and vice versa for the couple. If one of the original members of the couple can't stand the new additional that's an obviously bad sign, or if the newbie is only interested in one. Especially as a married couple, who has love and respect for each other, we would probably be the ones moving slowly. I need to make sure I like you and that we are compatible as friends before I'm going to invite you to sleep with me and my husband, or just him, or just me.   I guess this question came up after I started browsing Tinder to see what that was all about and if it could make our search easier. So many woman in big, all caps, write something along the average lines of ""if you're just interested in a quick hookup go fuck yourself"", some profiles slightly more creative than the others but the other statements they make and the photos that they post to their profile literally scream DTF. And so many others just say ""absolutely no threesomes"" accompanied, usually, with some additional smart ass statements. Really, what is so unappealing about having two people, man and a woman, which hypothetical woman is hypothetically sexually attracted to both. You literally get to enjoy your favorite aspects of both worlds. I don't know, I'm really just rambling at this point with no clue where I was heading with that. It's late"

Some kids are more responsible than others; some will be ready at age 6, others at age 10.  For ear piercings it's basically just a little cleaning with a saline solution while gently spinning the earring.  One thing I definitely want to say though, is do not go to a piercing booth at the mall or anywhere that uses piercing guns. They are not as safe or sterile as a professional piercing. It might feel weird to take a little girl to a professional tattoo or piercing shop, but it is actually the more responsible thing to do. Here's a TIME magazine article on the topic."

My mom did limit me to only small earrings for the first couple years, like no big dangling ones or giant hoops. Usually just different stud ones that may have had different shapes."

If she's expressing the interest, maybe have a conversation with her about the responsibility, and about how it won't be in a chair at a mall booth but in a proper piercing studio. Prepare her for what will happen and how the procedure will go (the use of real needles, the environment maybe being something she isn't used to). I've been friends with a lot of piercers and a few owners of piercing/tattoo shops, and they are always fabulous with little ones getting their ears pierced.

But that's probably because the kinds of people round my area that have their kid's ears pierced that age are definitely the tacky type, so I'm clearly biased.  But I do think 10 is a bit young. I'd agree 12 was a good point as she's likely to understand the aftercare, being careful catching them on things, wearing hygiene and so on. I also believe that people develop allergies to metals much more easily when they're young, so unless she's planning on wearing silver, gold or platinum, it might be worth avoiding compound earrings (think with nickel in for example)."

askwomenadvice,3dmbg1,hsvhrt,3,Fri Jul 17 12:51:59 2015 UTC,"Any girl/guy who is the type who ""disappears"" once a new relationship starts has some sort of issue where they think their relationship is the MOST IMPORTANT THING IN THE WORLD! I have a friend who's mom kicked all 3 of her kids out of her house when she got a new boyfriend and moved to NJ, mind you the kids were about 19, 17 and 15 years old and forced to live on their own or move to NJ. From this, my friend followed the same pattern, dating abusive men who she drops EVERYTHING for and loses all her friends until they break up and she comes crawling back. I'm not saying your friend has to be in an abusive relationship but she def has some priority issues.  Also, it's possible she has feeling for you if she doesn't feel ALL her boyfriends would be  ""comfortable"" with you two hanging out. I'm a girl and I have three times as many guy friends as I do girl friends. My boyfriends were all forced to accept that and my current BF had trust issues at first but after meeting my friends he calmed down. I told him ""I've never even hooked up with any of these guys and I've known them for 9 years, during my 3 years of being single I WOULD have hooked up with one of them if I had feelings but obviously I don't and I won't..   I honestly wouldn't even waste my time on this girl friend of yours.. If she disappears and then comes crawling back after every break up that's not a friendship that's a place holder and a shoulder to cry on until she finds someone new.. Tell her you want to meet her BF and if she says no tell her you're out. I don't talk to the friend who dumps her friends every time a new BF is around because I'm looking for REAL LOYAL friends and if you can only be my friend on YOUR schedule that's not a friend at all...   Good luck OP"
askwomenadvice,3dmbg1,ALittleBirdyToldMe25,4,Fri Jul 17 13:14:56 2015 UTC,"Some girls are very dependant on the guy that they are dating - they see them as the be all and end all of their lives. They feel ""complete"" somehow, magically.   It's very tedious for the guys involved because it's the quickest way a girl can make herself the most boring person in their lives.   ""Familiarly breeds contempt"" and all that.  It sounds like your friend is the one inventing these standards for her conduct so she can feel like a princess.   I'm an older guy and have lots of female friends.  Girls like this never make good friends because they are racing to the end of their lives - they want fulfilment by proxy, once it's the boyfriend it will be the apartment, then kid, then house then yawn.   Try and make friends with someone who enjoys life as it is.   A decent friend will introduce you to their boyfriend or friends and want to make sure they get on.   There's that, or alternatively she just wants to spend time with her boyfriend?   Who knows.   Either case, she's a fairweather friend and you should look elsewhere for other friends.   Don't dump her or do anything dramatic, it just looks like you can't rely on her, so don't."

It might just be that she has been convinced in the past that going on frienddates alone with guys is The Wrong Thing, which I disagree with but whatever. So now she doesn't want to.   It sounds like she gets really wrapped up in relationships and values partners above friends, but don't hold that against her - let her live her life the way she wants and just drop her a text saying 'if you [and boyfriend?] wanna hang out sometime let me know plans'. If she replies, great, if she doesn't, it doesn't really seem like you'd want to be friends with her anyway.   PS in my experience a lot of men are like that, so I wouldn't be surprised if they just literally all have said its not ok and she isn't yet ready to say well fuck you they're my friends.

askwomenadvice,3dj5x6,ThePlottingPanda,4,Thu Jul 16 18:18:57 2015 UTC,"Is it damaged like split ends and super dry, candy floss (cotton candy maybe for you) or bubblegum? Dryness can usually be fixed with protein treatments, coconut oil and regular trimming, but if you try to lift one strand and all the other strands lift with it, you might want to consider cutting it short. If it stretches out like bubblegum when you pull on it, I hope you look good with a buzzcut :P   What kind of colour stripper did you use? If you tell me the brand I'll google it for ingredients. It would be really helpful to see some photos too to judge the damage and how many 'bands' of colour you have in your hair. Sometimes you can get away with just cutting away a couple of the bands (so the bits that have been exposed to the most chemical processes) and it helps enormously.   For colour, if you want to save money and don't mind going dark, I'd probably dye it a deep brown colour (hides a lot of damage) using an at-home no ammonia formula. If you went a couple of shades darker than the darkest bit of your hair now, you would get almost as good a result as going to a salon."

There are definitely instances when a man and a woman can't be friends, or a woman and a woman can't be friends, or a man and a man can't be friends.

askwomenadvice,3diw2x,curiiouscat,4,Thu Jul 16 20:47:53 2015 UTC,"Because he said he can't handle it, and she's not respecting that. It's not like they just casually fell out of touch.

Every one answering is saying there is no way a girl would want to be friends with a guy unless she was using him.  It's frankly disgusting.  They were friends for SIX YEARS.  Wow, maybe she enjoyed him as a person, like he pretended to for 5.  OP you got jealous and ended the friendship.  Being romantic/sexual was more important than who she was as a person.  This is your typical friend zone rant.  She is probably hoping you grew up a bit and you could be friends like you used to.  Tell her that you don't care about her other than banging her, which is what it sounds like."
askwomenadvice,3diw2x,Life-in-Death,2,Thu Jul 16 20:14:51 2015 UTC,"With respect, nobody is saying that. It seems like you're mad that people are generalizing a woman, and it seems like you are generalizing a man. Simply, you're being downvoted because you sound like a hypocrite. You're making a lot of assumptions and asserting that OP never cared about her at all, only wanted to fuck. He never mentioned a sexual relationship.  It sounds like she knows full well how he felt about her and that he couldn't continue a friendship with her. Instead of being a dick and pretending to be her friend while interested in her romantically, he chose to end their contact. It would be nice if we could all go back to being ""just friends"" with someone we had romantic feelings for, but that's not always possible. Emotions are not always logical.   He doesn't have to be friends with her if he doesn't want to/can't, regardless of why. Simultaneously, she may be authentic in her intentions. It doesn't have to be one or the other."
askwomenadvice,3djqhc,Bungalored,19,Thu Jul 16 20:48:01 2015 UTC,"Duuuuuude. She was cheating on her BF with you. This wasn't some hot romance, she was lonely and you were willing. Do not try to chase after her. Do not wait for her. Nothing is going to happen here. Move on."
askwomenadvice,3djqhc,Rowsdowerr,-5,Thu Jul 16 21:03:02 2015 UTC,No. I think she was pretty close to leaving her bf until he got a change of location to London.

askwomenadvice,3djqhc,Teaandabook,14,Fri Jul 17 08:40:32 2015 UTC,"Ok, you asked this question about an hour ago, and you have not received many answers. My guess is mainly because you refuse to listen. /u/Rowsdowerr is right. You might not like it and you might not want to hear it, but she is not worth it. She is a young girl who was horny and you were her escape.   She cheated on her boyfriend with you, meaning that she is more than willing to do that with anyone. Take a step back, breathe a little and look at the situation. She had sex with you while in a relationship with someone else. Even though she told you that he really matters to her.   She might have told you that she wanted to break up with her boyfriend to be with you, but that was done either because she knew it was something you wanted to hear or something she needed to say to calm her own guilt.   However, the situation you are in is not because of her. You need to focus on yourself now. Don't take this as the end of your love life, this is only the beginning. Yea it hurt, especially since you blocked her and she is not reaching out to you. And don't be afraid to cry. Men, we can cry all we want, its perfectly OK to feel sadness, or happiness or anger for that matter. But one thing is shedding tears and other is throwing a tantrum. Take control of your own actions and more importantly take control of your own future.   A girl or guy finds disinterest in a person when they seem to be dependent on someone other than themselves for their own happiness. Meaning if you start feeling like you need her to be happy and she sees this it will be a turn off. To her you will be a burden. This is what you need to change. You need to be happy on your own. But you need to change the way you see yourself to do this.   This is where the hard part comes. Because this is something that you need to do without having an immediate motivating factor. You should not do it to get back with her, or to get any other girl. You need to do it to be good with yourself. Once you are good with yourself people (girls) will see it. They will see you and will see that you are happy and secure with yourself. That is what's attractive.   If you tell her that you will wait for her, of course she wont say no to you. You're her get-out-of-jail-free card. If her boyfriend dumps her she has you to fall on, but you will take the hit. And she will know what you are willing to put up with. So even if she does come back to you, whats to stop her from cheating on YOU this time. And on the other hand, if she doesn't come back, you are fucked, way super fucked. You didn't work on yourself. you were stuck waiting empty handed for someone who really didn't even care. But the saddest part is that you didn't even care about your own self to do something, to change, to better yourself. And with that no one would want to date you either.   So get your head out of the gutter. Man up, and start working on yourself. Go to the gym or work out at home. Eat healthier. brush your teeth tree every single time you eat, make your bed when you get up. Iron your clothes. Get some nice dress shirts if you have the money. If not, make sure they are always clean. That YOU are always clean. Get a hair cut, trim your beard, trim your pubes, shave your pits if you want. Use body lotion, body powder, deodorant. Make sure you FEEL clean, that you FEEL healthy. It makes a difference. All the little things will add up to the point that it will make a difference in the way you see yourself and the way you are. Then you won't need to worry about finding a mate, they will find you."

And that he knows about our fling. I don't think she's lying. Once, after a night, I didn't care too much and just dropped her home without talking much. I was feeling sick. She was angry that I'm just into the sex. I think she actually wanted to get serious. But now I don't know. Her bf is moving to a better place with a great job, here I am leading a mediocre life... I want her to know I'm hurt.  I'm done with her. My problem is I feel like hurting/punishing myself to show her I'm hurt. I know it's stupid. But how do I get myself to not do that??  ANOTHER THING THAT MAKES ME CRY OUT LOUD. I LEFT MY PRIDE AT HER FEET AND TOLD HER SHE'S MY ANGEL, TRUE LOVE AND SHIT. I cant put my finger on that feeling, but I feel sad for saying those things. I now think she wasn't any of those things. I bloated her ego for no reason."
askwomenadvice,3djqhc,TheGoodWife77,3,Fri Jul 17 02:31:59 2015 UTC,"Don't hurt yourself. Resist the urge and toss it out. Life is already painful as it is. We must try to heal ourselves, instead of making things harder.  And just look back at the things you said and did with a blind eye, laugh at it and move forward. We all do stupid things for love (serotonin/dopamine or whatever you would like to call it.) Feeling loved by someone is awesome, you start to realize that you have some worth in you. But you have to understand that your worth has always been there. You need to learn to love yourself, which will make you feel infinitely times better, without the need of anyone else accepting you. Now I'm not saying to throw out the good feeling of being accepted, just that once you start working on yourself, you won't need it anymore.  Also, I'm not saying to be a hermit and live in the mountains haha. Just to learn to love yourself and accept who you are, and always consider room for improvement. Working out is much more than just physical appearance. It relieves stress and creates discipline. Eating healthy also keeps you from feeling gloomy and gives you more energy. Look at yourself and see where you want to be and work towards that goal. Once you reach it, set another one and so on and so on.   As far as your pride and her bloated ego, consider it ""sunk costs"" (econ 101, brother :)) and forget about it. You cant change the past so stop wallowing over it. Focus on what to do now to make yourself a better future."

You are not a character in a romance novel who just needs to love him out of being ""brooding"" or ""complicated"" or ""misunderstood."" He does not want as much affection as you do, and he obviously doesn't feel motivated to change that. And honestly, he doesn't have to change for you, just like you shouldn't change for him.  I know you care for him a lot, but it really doesn't sound like you're romantically compatible. Continuing to date this man is a waste of your time. Find someone who actually is compatible with you, including in the way he shows affection, because that person is out there.  If you want, you can sit down with him and lay it all out on the table. If he's too depressed to have frank conversations about the problems in your relationship, then he's too depressed to have a girlfriend right now. There's no expectation for you to martyr yourself over that.

Maybe something along the lines of ""We've been good friends for a while but I was wondering if you would like to see if we could be something more by going on a date on Saturday.  No pressure though.  If you're not interested, we'll still be friends.""  Whatever you do, do NOT do a ""feelings dump"" where you confess how long you've been attracted to her for and how you feel like you're in love with her as it will probably make her feel like you've only been her friend because you're attracted to her.  Just keep it casual and make sure that she understands that you'll still be friends even if she isn't interested in dating her."

If she declines, then of course you can always say, ""I value your friendship above all else so the only thing that changes is that you now know I find you gorgeous."" Or something like that in a light tone. What I have used in the past to maintain amazing friendships with guy friends were something like, ""I'm flattered but (whatever the reason), however, I appreciate our friendship and hope to continue it if that's alright with you.""

Join her for activist events? Like any interest your partner is passionate about, you'll have to participate in it if you want to prove it's important to you too.  You might also look at how you react when she brings it up in conversation - do you actively listen and try to relate, or do your eyes sort of glaze over and you wait for the conversation to be done?"
askwomenadvice,3dgg2k,carboncle,5,Thu Jul 16 02:08:55 2015 UTC,"Here is the real issue. By dismissing feminism, you are minimizing the discrimination your girlfriend has no doubt experienced. My fianc√© was like this several years back. I remember him being on a rant that date rape was not that common and women were totally paranoid when it came to dating. And I very quietly mentioned that I had been the victim of four different attempted rapists, on first dates. That was the day he became a feminist.  By dismissing feminism you have dismissed her experiences. This is very personal to a lot of us. We've seen it, we've experienced it. We shouldn't have to be afraid, but we are. We shouldn't be looked at as slightly less human for being female, but we are. And for you to dismiss that as crazy talk hurts. My fianc√© used to think a girl should say no to stop you. Now he thinks a guy should ask and get a yes before continuing. He used to think girls were paranoid. Now he's as fiercely protective of my drink in bars as I am. He used to think sexist jokes were something you should just ignore. Now he's adopted a response of ""Not funny, dude."" Whenever he hears one. He doesn't go to rallies or burn bras. He doesn't have to. It's just a quiet shift of attitude. It's an awareness. He's done what he can to make himself less threatening to women he meets, and become very protective of me to make me feel safer, without ever suggesting that I'm not strong and capable. It's not perfection, but it's getting close."
askwomenadvice,3dgg2k,MuppetManiac,4,Thu Jul 16 13:35:51 2015 UTC,"I think it's all about educating yourself. Maybe read a book, watch a documentary she suggests? Join her for the events she attends. Talk about news stories you read about inequality. We can't all be the biggest fans of whatever our partners love, but it's really easy and very meaningful when you take active strides to connect with them on something they love.  On another note, try not to let TumblrInAction, Reddit views, etc. influence your views on feminism. It's like saying Donald Trump is a super accurate representation of the Republican Party, when he's obviously not, just a weirdly public outlier.  EDIT: Bell Hooks' Feminism is For Everybody is a great, essential short read on the subject, if you want to start there! It's like one-hundred-ish pages and dirt cheap online."

Why put yourself at risk for STDs and pregnancy if you're getting nothing out of it?   Secondly, you're still very young. Many people your age have never been in a serious relationship before, so don't panic about that.  As for finding a proper boyfriend, consider online dating. On sites like OKcupid, you can specify that you're looking for something long-term, and there are many guys looking for the same thing. The advantage of online dating is that you can list all your interests and find someone compatible, which improves your chances of finding a proper relationship instead of just hook-ups."
askwomenadvice,3dcyc5,runnnnaway,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:16:46 2015 UTC,"Sleeping around doesn't bring trouble,  if that's what you really want. But that's not.   Also, you might think they just want sex, but they might just want to have fun and take more time to call it more than sex. And it's not a bad thing. Loving someone takes time.   And even as a woman, if a guy wouldn't have sex with me, I would totally stop seeing him."
askwomenadvice,3dcyc5,blueXcat,-1,Fri Jul 17 20:16:25 2015 UTC,"I thought I'd jump in here with some advice.  I'm a 30 y/o guy who's dated a lot of girls over the past 15 or so years.  I've found that this happens to a lot of girls.  Ones I know personally.  The truth, as horrible as it might sound,  is that the majority (maybe 75%??) of good-looking, charming guys under 28ish are not looking for a relationship.  And this is in spite of what they might tell you.  Or rather, even if they aren't opposed to being in a relationship, they might just not be into you like that but still what to be physical with you.  A lot of times this has less to do with you and your desirability than it does the society we live in nowadays, where a new possible mate is just a click away... all the time.  There's an instant reward culture now and good looking guys realized a long time ago that the wild monkey dance is extremely easy to come by as compared to even 10 years ago.  This might be hard to stomach but it's the tough truth.  Another sad truth is that you might not be able to tell if a guy is ACTUALLY into you until after being intimate with him a couple of times... and only then if he's still pursuing you and going out of his way to spend time with you.  So in summary, don't be discouraged.  You're really young.  And these days guys your age are rarely looking to settle down, or even date.  And those who are looking to date and who you're attracted to are likely being extremely picky.  One thing women have a hard time coming to terms with is that all men long for s e x, all day every day.  So those who can get it readily will continue to want to do so.  This is just my input from experience and talking with friends.  Take from it what you will."

If you're in your teens, there is noting wrong with being cute and adorable.  Trust me, some day you will wish you could look cute and adorable.  It's not only what you wear but who you are and how you carry yourself.  So if you absolutely must be 'hot' make sure you know how to walk in a pair of high heels properly - small steps, walk slowly, slow head movements, no sudden hand gestures and stand/walk straight.  Soft tones, no loud outbursts.  Eye contact is critical and of course, the ability to carry on an interesting conversation.  Hint:  People love to talk about themselves, asking appropriate (neutral) questions is a good way to converse.  The way you look and get judged as cute or hot is only for an instant.  If you're looking to be remembered as hot, it's body language and conversation."
askwomenadvice,3dcikn,Bronzent,4,Wed Jul 15 05:00:36 2015 UTC,"The best thing you can do is to be prepared! If possible, pick out your seats and print out your ticket and luggage tag beforehand. Some airlines allow this; some don't. Make sure your carryon bag has your phone and charger, a pillow and blanket (if you want them for the flight), reading material (or something else to keep you entertained), and snacks. Don't bring any drinks - you'll have to throw them away before going through security.  Most importantly, get to the airport with PLENTY of time. Trust me, it is a million times better to sit in the gate bored than to be rushing to get there. I try to arrive at the airport an hour and a half to two hours before my flight leaves - this ensures that I have time to get my ticket, check my bag, go through security, find a place to eat, and find my gate with plenty of time, even if there are long lines or I get lost.  Make sure you pay attention, too! Pay attention to the arrival/departure boards to make sure your plane isn't leaving early. Pay attention once you are on the plane to what baggage claim you should go to upon arrival.   I have been flying alone since I was 12 years old. You are going to be just fine! :)  TL;DR: Come to the airport prepared, arrive at the airport an hour and a half to two hours before your flight leaves, pay attention to important information."

Chew gum and it will alleviate the discomfort. Once I didn't and when I landed I had an earache that felt like an ice pick was shoved in my head.  If you have a laptop or tablet, grab some headphones and download a movie or a couple episodes of a tv show. It'll help pass the time.  Be prepared to be cramped and uncomfortable for a few hours. Go to the bathroom before you get on. Make sure you are at check in early. Don't bring anything on board that isn't allowed, it's a huge hassle and you'll lose it. Put a lock on your checked luggage, and try not to check anything super valuable if you can help it."

Weigh your luggage and check it against your airline allowance.   Other than that, it is the same stuff for all kinds if travel. Wear layers so if you get hot you can take them off, and something that's really comfortable. Sometimes the cabin can be really airconditioned. I hate those tiny blankets they give you ><  Load up some music or a movie etc on some form of device, in case the onboard entertainment sucks.  I also take some boiled sweets (in the US maybe it's called hard candy??) Because that recycled air is nasty on a long haul flight.  Oh one last thing - pack your hand luggage in such a way that stuff you'll have to take out for security (ie liquids, electronics) are easy to remove and repack.  Enjoy your flight! Save travels."

Do not send long gut wrenching emotional texts to someone you barely know.   DO NOT go confront this girl where she works. Just leave it be. Either she didn't like you or she's a shit communicator and things got messed up, whatever the case it's done. Move on.  Also as a general rule, asking out retail workers/waitstaff is a terrible idea. They're paid to be nice to you. They're paid to say 'yes' to you and not cause trouble.

askwomenadvice,3dc3cs,missmaudiez,2,Wed Jul 15 03:09:32 2015 UTC,"OK so for the next year or two, your motto should be that you are not ready to look for a romantic opportunity with a girl.  Any girl you meet should be purely thought of as a potential friend.  That being said, where do you go day to day? Coffee shop, school, job, doctors office?   You need to do this in steps:  *Smile at 1 girl per day that you might consider a potential friend.   *Smile at them on a second occasion of seeing them. Then, start a conversation. Make a statement about her like ""Ooh I see you're reading _____, that's a great book"" or ""Those are some cool socks"". Nothing about her body/face/hair. This conversation should be only a few minutes long and then you should move on, saying that you have somewhere to be. This takes the pressure off and allows you to see whether that person is kind/open to talking to new people.  *This third time you encounter one of these people, ask if you can hang out at the same table while doing some activity (I'm imagining a bookstore, coffeeshop or school situation). Ask them about themselves and see if you relate to any of their interests or hobbies.    *If you feel like you have commonalities,  ask if they'd like to hang out.  Go to the movies to see something you had talked about or do some activity you guys click on.  The point here is that you should be looking for friends that share interests with you.  They also love Superman or weed or handcrafting swords from scratch or whatever. If you don't share any similarities,  there's nothing to build a friendship on.  Good luck :)"

If you want to seriously be involved in someone's life, you're going to have to probably give up some of that time or find a very understanding partner. There's only going to be so many times you can cancel out on seeing someone before they're gonna give up trying to make something work with you."

askwomenadvice,3d9ui2,mangaholic,2,Tue Jul 14 19:57:50 2015 UTC,What is a good date depends on the people involved.  What makes an awesome date for me (spending the day out thrifting and then picking up Chinese food to eat while cuddling on the couch) would sound like a horrible date for someone else.  What are her interests?  Would she like a silly date where the two of you go to a bowling alley and make fools of yourselves?  Would she prefer a more traditional dinner date?  Is there a movie in theaters that she would like and then the two of you go for pizza afterwards?  A local festival or street fair that the two of you could explore together?  Would she prefer going out clubbing together?

I think the appropriate next steps are:   Tell her you'd like to take her on a real date.  Offer two date options that have two parts (dinner and movie, coffee and arcade, etc.) and let her choose. If the date is going well, it's an appropriate time to hold her hand while walking, put arm around her while watching a movie,  brush a hair out of her face  and tell her how beautiful she is when you two are alone.   A few dates later,  ask her how she feels about you two.  What does she want?  Relationship/continue hooking up/just be friends are all options that you are to take respectfully.  If you are ready to proceed with a relationship, take her to a park or lakeside or beach pier and ask her!"

For niche interests that's really the best place. Plus, most women aren't looking on sites like Craigslist or anonymous apps for hookups or relationships in general, fetishy or not. I strongly recommend to anyone with serious fetish interests, who wants to explore them, to join their local BDSM community and get out there and meet some other real live fetishists. Most people in this community rely strongy on the community aspect to keep themselves safe and accountable. Women who have fetishes have to be extra careful."

Be well groomed and dressed appropriately for where you are. Try some web dating. Remember that these women are human people. Talk to them like they're human people. Individual human people, who are not just clones of their age bracket and gender."

It doesn't matter what his intentions were behind it because in the end, he chose to put his personal wants (""scared to lose yet another partner"") in front of your sexual health. Just because it's only HPV doesn't make it justifiable. Sure, a lot of people cope with it and have no huge problems, but that doesn't mean everyone is okay with contracting it.   Personally, this is how I feel. I am not okay with any STDs without prior knowledge of 1) how was it contracted and 2) getting to know the person better. If I loved my partner and saw myself spending a long time/forever with them, then I would be willing to have unprotected sex and possibly get infected with HPV.   I understand that it's a hard thing to admit, but admitting it sooner than later seems to me a lot better (I personally don't tolerate liars). I feel like someone who can sit me down and explain it seriously and have a genuine concern to help me understand it will immediately gain my trust and liking.

Small enough that it fits in your hand, i.e. can't be seen if you don't want anyone to see it.   Your task is to hand him the piece of paper or place it on the counter in front of him. By this action alone he will know that you want to be more than a customer. Even if you're so anxious you can't speak, the necessary will have been done!  I would probably wait til I thought there was no one in the store then walk in, go straight up to him and ask ""Are you single?"". If he says ""no"" then I would add ""Well if you find yourself single, feel free to text me."" whilst handing over the note then walking out with a bounce in my step.  If he says ""yes"" I would hand over the note and say ""If you'd like to go out sometime give me a shout"", grin massively and take it from there (maybe immediately walk out the shop whilst throwing one more massive smile over my shoulder).

She never masturbates (very very sensitive clitoris, so she has abandoned the idea to touch this area). I wanted to buy her a cute and nice toy as a surprise present, but i'm afraid the toy is going to stay in the packaging forever :/ I'm sure this could help A LOT !

Not as a ""man"""
askwomenadvice,3d4m5t,fishielicious,8,Mon Jul 13 15:46:55 2015 UTC,"I don't consider that a lack of respect? Either that or I don't really understand where you're coming from. You said yourself that she said she was looking for more friends, I believe that to be a strong indicator that she's keeping you informed of her intentions.   Sometimes it is hard for women to be forward and honest because we have been socialized to be quiet and polite. When we are forward, many tend to believe we are being too aggressive (or quite plainly, ""a bitch"").   Just from a female perspective here as well, it feels like you have invested more into this than she has. It bothers you a lot that she hasn't texted back when in reality, there are a number of reasons why: 1) she may have not known what to respond to that 2) she may have even felt like she was just being nice and you started flirting (accentuating that she called it ""special"" mix) and didn't respond as to not encourage flirting 3) she's a busy person and got preoccupied 4) she's a bad texter, a lot of people are 5) she forgot to reply because she was in the middle of something 6) or she's doing the slow fade because she didn't actually want to give you her number and was just being nice.   Personally, I think if a guy asks a forward question they can expect a forward answer. Just be polite and text her (do not mention you were bothered she didn't reply, if anything, ignore the fact she hasn't): ""hey, I was just wondering if you'd like to go on a date sometime?"" If you're not bothered with the possibility she may only want to be friends, you can add ""It's totally fine if you're not interested, we could still be friends!"" This allows her to at least not feel pressured to do something she may not want to."

That's why I said there's such a huge possibility of what the reality actually is.  What you've described could go either way: either she's just being nice or maybe she's actually interested in you. There's just not enough information. The fact she didn't reply isn't an actual indicator that she's not interested. As I said before, I think you should just ask her out on a date. If she says no to that, you won't have to wonder if you missed out on something real."

If one person was reluctant, the other person should not push. There doesn't need to be the word 'no'. That's the whole point about the 'Yes means yes' campaign: There should be clear consent, not just an absence of outright refusal.   but under gentle pressure from M (things like ""you know you want to. It'll be fun. Come on.""), J succumbed.   Are you fucking kidding me? Where is the doubt?   Look, I'll go on pretending you're asking 'for a friend' or whatever, but I will not pretend that wasn't outright rape, and that the rapists should feel the utmost remorse and shame.  And I'll also just pretend like you aren't here, testing the feeeemales with this story, just to switch the assumed genders."

My only note of potential dishonesty is rooted in my faith that M is a genuinely good person.  I refused to consider the possibility that M was completely aware of J's intoxicated state and reluctance.  I'm not making things up to fit a theory, but if it really means that much to you to sleuth this out, no, I'm not trying to help a friend. I'm J in this story, but I don't feel comfortable being public with that.  I would rather consider all possibilities and try to better understand all of this, so that I can approach it with everyone's best interest in mind.  I've been really confused about this whole situation, and people's advice has been really helpful thus far.  I don't think it matters that I'm male in this situation. If this exact thing happened to a close female friend of mine, I would feel the same way about it and offer my support just like that."

I wil echo another user and say that you should consider getting help in dealing with what happened. If you're in the US contact RAINN. They have the right knowledge and resources.  Don't try to drown out what happened by making up stories in your head about good people and mishaps. You risk hurting yourself that way.   I don't think it matters that I'm male in this situation.

I think I'd be better off accepting that it happened and that it can't be changed, and that it was the product of a misunderstanding.  I don't feel any anger or blame toward M in this situation, but I have an angel and a devil on my shoulder here saying completely different things.    Sometimes it comes back to me and I just feel afraid, if that makes sense.  I'm worried about what this means in the future; if it's that easy for M to accidentally assault me, what if I do it to somebody completely unwillingly?  I mean, I won't, I'm pretty well informed as far as consent goes, but it could happen to a close friend or something.  Sometimes I feel like I should be angry at her or like I should have done something more.  I could have gotten out of that and I didn't, in the immediate hindsight.  If I'd been more straightforward with saying 'no,' it wouldn't have happened. I almost brought it on myself there, and maybe I don't deserve to be bitter or feel as though I was wronged, even slightly."
askwomenadvice,3d5c2v,Rowsdowerr,2,Mon Jul 13 18:26:32 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you're making complete sense. It opens up a lot of nasty questions:   If M is a good person, does that mean you need to accept that good people willingly do things that end up hurting others so much? If she's not, how come you couldn't tell beforehand? (And here comes the classic self-doubt and self-blame.) And what are you supposed to do with all these hurt, confused, and betrayed feelings now?   Should you tell anyone? Talk to her? Keep it to yourself?  What will happen after you make that choice?   Yeah, you're entitled to confusion and not knowing exactly what you want or should do.  I can't really tell you, but I'll tell you this: It was not at all your fault! End of. Consent goes both ways for both genders. What she did was not ok, no matter why she did it. If her thinking is that men can't be raped, that's her sexism, not your failing. You should not have to fight her off to be respected.  But do please contact RAINN or some similar organization. They'll know your options, and they'll know what ways you can start mentally processing.  And, as an ugly truth along the rest: You need to get yourself tested for STDs..."

If you're not sure, don't do it.  The fact that there was initial reluctance, AND J wasn't really into it, AND J asked M to leave partway through should be an obvious indicator that advances were unwelcome.  J should seek professional help, M should avoid contact.

I have no idea what she thinks about you, but try to look back and remember if she ever gave weak-sounding excuses or looked uncomfortable when you got near her etc.  If she seemed happy, you're probably fine.   Try giving her a PM at the same time you send the friend request, saying who you are and that you'd love to keep in touch, but understand if she feels uncomfortable doing that.

I love it because we can very quickly get info (we are both organisey people) about each other's dept's plans/procedures and can help each other out, we have a few but not many mutual work friends. The downsides are basically that because he was here first I often get referred to as '[SO]'s wifey' instead of like, my name or my title.

Tell her that you think she's gorgeous the way she is now and that she'll be gorgeous whether her boobs grow more or not. Girls really like it when their partners tell them they're gorgeous.  Possibly introduce her to 'Busty Girl Comics' and 'Flat Girl Comics' if she hasn't already heard of them - they're comics written by women about the assorted advantages and disadvantages of different boob sizes and really helps self-conscious girls to feel more comfortable in their own bodies."

Best thing to do is to drop the other girls and give the girl you are interested in some time/space and see if she comes around. If she doesn't then it is okay to start looking around.   Tell her that you understand that she needs time and that you are more than happy to give that to her. Let her know that she is important to you and that you will stand by her side and when she is ready you would love a chance to show her how she should be treated.   Just give her space, time or whatever she needs, and if you don't want to squander your chances then you will stop talking to these other girls, and just focus on her. I don't think she would take it very well if she found out that you are talking to others due to that she thinks you are interested in her, and just her and once again she would be hurt.   If she is worth it then you would just want to get to know her better."

I only assume it's because of a bad break up because when I asked her what the worst part of dating is she said when someone you love slowly loses interest and fades away and she said that happened to her recently.

askwomenadvice,3d1viv,WorldStopCarryOn,0,Mon Jul 13 04:44:46 2015 UTC,"One of the things that you're discounting is that you're not starting from square one. You are way more aware of who you are and what you want than most people in their first relationships.  I realize that you feel as if everyone has 5-7 years of relationship experience under their belts and your lack of experience will stick out like a sore thumb, but that's really not how it works. No one knew what the fuck they were doing at fifteen, but they thought they did. Growing up and getting experience just means that you realize that everyone is different. Kissing guy a and guy b are two totally different experiences, regardless of expertise or time practiced. The best kissers take advice, follow leads and do what they think will feel good (with consent). Everyone is nervous. So your lack of experience won't be taken as, ""oh, this guy doesn't know what he's doing."" rather as ""this guy is as different a kisser as guy a and guy b"" The person I least enjoyed kissing was the biggest player and probably kissed the most girls. Why did I not like it? I wasn't a fan of that much tongue or slobber, which is funny, because some girls were! (at least, from the rumor mill in high school).   Also, you're at an age where women should be able to express what they want. Pretend that you just want to hear her vocalize what she wants and what she likes. You might not last long... the first time, but laugh it off and keep up the foreplay until you can get it up again. Honestly, for women its more about foreplay than PIV thrusting anyway. Sex doesn't have to be over the first time you orgasm.  Additionally, the second you realize that you might like a girl, ask her for coffee. I know that seems like a huge step and what if you get rejected? Well, then you get rejected and you might get a friend out of it."
askwomenadvice,3d33uu,piratesarrrawesome,5,Mon Jul 13 03:29:46 2015 UTC,"I mean... She has a responsive desire, that's very common with women. This could very easily backfire on you, and make her feel pressured. Which will make her want sex less. So tread very carefully.  Casual touches - PG stuff - throughout the day could help you guys connect better. Try to appeal to the emotional aspects of sex as opposed to the physical ones. Show affection, not attraction."
askwomenadvice,3d33uu,MuppetManiac,5,Mon Jul 13 04:05:43 2015 UTC,Lighten her load. Regularly.  The #1 thing that kee women's libido down is stress and fatique. So the logical thing would be to relieve some of that on a regular basis.
askwomenadvice,3d33uu,Svataben,2,Mon Jul 13 06:27:27 2015 UTC,"Also ask her to tell you something intimate about herself, personal..maybe about sex - ask her to describe her perfect sexual experience? or just something she could share with you that she never has. I think sometimes we feel we are just here to provide sex. But you being truly interested in her as a person and sharing secrets might builds intimacy, which can make us want to make love. At least it does for me. Feeling special amd important."
askwomenadvice,3d33uu,Teaandabook,1 point,Mon Jul 13 04:41:40 2015 UTC,"Clearly you have no communication issue, so I don't need to berate you for not talking to her. Good on you for being a mature adult!  Casual, loving, yet intimate touch can be an incredible turn-on. Kisses to the back of the neck, ears, hands and fingers can be effective too. I'm sure you'll know which of these gets the biggest reaction from your wife.   Do you know if she likes dirty talk? Dirty talk can work in many different ways - some women like super crude talk, some like hearing about things like 'going to kiss every inch of you' etc.  Whispering things like that in her ear about what you plan to do later may work, but you'd need to consult her first to check if she's comfortable with that.  I don't know what kind of person your wife is - maybe she would enjoy you grabbing her ass, maybe that's a massive turn-off.  It's up to you guys to discuss these things and figure out what you each prefer. Good luck!"

Some cats are great about being separated--maybe a couple of days of looking around for the other one, and then they settle in to a routine. Just look for problems with lots of stress.  For example, make sure they are using the litter box, eating, doing normal cat stuff. If things are bad and not working out and you start having major problems, then maybe your ex can take them both. The thing with this is, would you be willing to talk to your ex if the cat needs to be reunited with his brother.  The other thing is, you are probably going to be sad and lonely, too.

Sometimes they bounce back but I see no reason to put this strain on them.   They should be together regardless of whether one likes one person more than the other. (Having a preference for one owner over the other doesn't mean the cat doesn't like the other owner. You should keep the cats best interest in mind and not keep the cat for selfish reasons).   Perhaps post to /r/cats"

askwomenadvice,3d1byy,IAmOtto,5,Sun Jul 12 18:32:21 2015 UTC,Have you told him how this lack of intimacy makes you feel? He might think you're OK with it. Sometimes guys just need it unambiguous and right in front of them to understand.

askwomenadvice,3d1byy,maotzu,2,Sun Jul 12 21:00:28 2015 UTC,"Try sending him some nudes while he is at work, or some racy messages. You can always initiate by showing up with lingerie or some other costume. There are tons of things you can try. Maybe handcuff him and do your own foreplay? You can always whisper things that you want him to do to you, too. Part of having a great sex life is wanting it, and wanting to make your partner want it too.    That being said, sometimes my partner and I won't have sex for a couple days, even though we usually have sex 1-2x a day. I think every once in a while it is normal to go for a few days without."

askwomenadvice,3d1f9s,headlessstark,3,Sun Jul 12 18:59:28 2015 UTC,"My rule for messages: Greeting + Something about me, something about you, some kind of specific compliment.   Example: Hi there. I saw in your profile that you liked pokemon blue. I thought I was the only one! I've spent hours playing that game. I always get stuck at the stupid radio tower- what's up with that?! We have a lot of similar interests and I am pretty jealous of your Game of Thrones shirt. I haven't seen that design before. House Stark is definitely amazing!  Lots of don'ts: Don't ask too many questions or for any personal info like name, area, school, etc. (she will mention it when she is ready) and try not to only talk about yourself or only talk about her. Address a few things that you two have in common at first. Don't ask her ten million questions- give her some statements that she is likely to respond to. Don't try to set up a date quickly or get her phone number. When the opportunity arises, after quite a few messages (10+, or over a few days at least), do it casually. (Such as: You like Chinese too? Have you ever been to the place on 5th? Their seafood soup is fantastic!) Overall you want to come off as casual, not desperate, and genuinely interested. This makes us feel more comfortable and like you are interested in more than casual sex, which makes us more likely to want to go out sometime.   Just because she responds to your messages doesn't mean she wants to go out sometime. Think of the messages like foreplay... You gotta warm her up first. There are tons of guys trying to get her to go out with them, so be down to earth and considerate."
askwomenadvice,3d1f9s,maotzu,2,Sun Jul 12 20:26:51 2015 UTC,"You should really Google this, because there's a ton of literature out there.

Please oh my GOD don't say shit like ""wow you're beautiful"" or ""hey sup sexy ;)"" or anything like that because I literally get that 20 times a day from a bunch of dudes who then go on to be inappropriately sexual or creepy.  EDIT: Forgot another pet peeve of mine: don't say ""I hope we can talk soon"" or ""would you like to talk""? It feels super stilted and weird."
askwomenadvice,3d1f9s,kanikkers,2,Sun Jul 12 19:21:58 2015 UTC,"Do's:   Talk about something relevant to her profile. If you both have similar interests, this keeps a conversation easy-going, especially if you can get her talking about something she's passionate about. This might not apply to everyone, but a funny opener works well for me. Keep it clever and cute, not degrading nor insensitive. Ask a genuinely interesting question. Personally, if someone asks me a question it means they want to know to get to know me better.  Compliment her on something other than her physical appearance.    Don'ts:   Open with, ""hey whats up"" ""how are you"" etc. This is too generic and isn't actually inquisitive. You're going to get little to no response.  Message her without reading her profile. You risk looking like a complete idiot by accidentally saying something that can be answered if you had, which can also come off insensitive and uncaring.  Compliment her physical appearance. We get a lot of these messages and it feels really fake, not to mention it's just monotonous. Immediately ask her on a date. Most women like to feel comfortable with who they go out with on a first date. We know that online dating can be boring and seemingly take forever, but we have to feel like 1) we're not about to meet some creepy stranger we barely know and 2) talking online may even help us decide we're not a fit match and neither of us will have to suffer through a bad first date.  Offer or ask for sexual favors. Unless their profile explicitly says they are interested in such a relationship, please don't ever bring it up."
askwomenadvice,3d1f9s,teap0ts,2,Mon Jul 13 02:23:49 2015 UTC,"Never compliment a woman on anything that has to do with her looks.  Never ask her out in the first email.  Never just say ""hi"" or ""hello"" or ""how are you"".  Don't tell her you have anything in common either (all men do this).  You will learn as you email women what works and doesn't.  You should comment something on her profile; ""I see you like to cook, are you creative in the kitchen or do you need a recipe like me?  What's your signature dish?  Mine is...""   Something like that.  You can comment on anything; pets, travel, books, movies, etc...  Don't ask anything too personal like her favorite bars and hangout joints (stalker).     Assume she's interested and end your email with something like ""Look forward to your response""  Also, get her number in 3-4 emails.  Women don't want email buddies and neither do you.  You aren't the only one she's emailing.  Other guys are too so your best chance is to get her on a date as soon as you email her.   Studies show the longer you wait for that first date after sending the first email, the lower your likelihood for success."

askwomenadvice,3cyi2h,poeticsnail,7,Sun Jul 12 00:14:31 2015 UTC,A gift card is nice. Not everyone is into VS though. Aerie and Nordstrom are great options as  well as they both have really cute undies.

As much as I love my boyfriend, we've been together for almost 2 years and he still can't get underwear right. It's a very personal thing, so having someone else pick something for you can be awkward. I'm pretty much like your girlfriend in that I prefer the plain stuff, and it was a shock when my boyfriend tried to be sweet by bringing me some lacy panties.

askwomenadvice,3cxeif,LucilleOne,3,Sat Jul 11 18:40:18 2015 UTC,"i like your plan, but i think you should take some time while you're in college to find yourself some good friends. specifically, some good female friends, because i don't think you're looking at this whole dating thing the way the rest of us do quite yet. in other words, it might be useful for you to get more exposed to how women think and feel (as it turns out, not at all that different to how men think and feel). and maybe also take some time to stop looking at this so much like an econ major (are you an econ major?). we're people. you're a person. i'll address some of your misconceptions below:     I am 5'6     this is is actually my preferred height, so.... i think the only people who fixate on height are people who are on the taller and shorter ends of the spectrum -- so as a short woman, i prefer my men on the shorter side. it stands to reason that tall women prefer taller men for similar reasons. as per usual, exceptions abound.       it doesn't help that I am from a minority ethnic group     while it is true that POC have harder time finding dates on traditional dating sites (according to OKC, anyway), the reasons why are fucked up. hopefully as our society evolves to be more accepting of POC you'll start having less issues on this front. also just because dating sites have those bias problems, doesn't mean those problems necessarily occur on a liberal college campus too.    that said, those two things - your height and your ethnicity, are not the only thing that makes you physically attractive, and physical attractiveness is not the only thing that makes you dateable, although it certainly helps at the beginning. in other words i know plenty of hot guys who can't find a relationship to save their lives, and plenty of conventionally less attractive guys who have absolutely no problem getting laid or keeping relationships.       whereas I prefer the opposite and I'm not willing to change that.     this is something you wanna be upfront about when you meet women to filter out those who don't have the same approach you do. i prefer to have sex first, but i've dated people who prefer to get to know me before initiating a sexual relationship too. Sometimes I'm game for it, as long as the guy is clear as to what his intentions are (ie. date me, not friend me). if the guy is unclear, however, most women won't wait for him to figure out what he wants and how to communicate it.       I should try to focus on myself and be the best person I can be   this is ALWAYS a good idea, whether you're good at getting dates or not     should also start reflecting on what my passions are and seek them out     not only because that makes you a more interesting person, but because it may make it more likely that you can meet women who have similar passions than you.    I should be competitive enough to outshine others by the time I'm 25     you date with your personality, not your resume. your resume may help or hinder you, but it isn't the end-all be-all. there's a reason we don't use linked-in for dating.     lawyer     not all women want to date doctors or lawyers. i personally can't stand the ""i'm smarter than you attitude"" or the long hours they keep, so i prefer to date people with jobs that do good for the community. each woman is different -- stop making so many assumptions about what we want. i bet this is what is getting in your way more than anything else.    best of luck."
askwomenadvice,3cxeif,buriedinthyeyes,2,Sat Jul 11 20:17:01 2015 UTC,"Ok first of all, 5'6"" is not the instant deal breaker you think it is. Secondly, I am 100% incapable of being attracted to anyone within 10 seconds.  I think you are selling yourself short - literally and figuratively. There will always be women out there who want to take things slow. And there will be women who find you attractive. You may just have to get to know them first.  Working in yourself is never a bad idea, but I think a good place to start is your attitude that all women think the same and like the same things. And are apparently too shallow to care about anything but height and skin color and make snap judgements."

Good friends that share your values and interests. Maybe they'll be someone you study or volunteer with. The more good friends you know, the more good people you're exposed to. Also, while most people (seriously, you think just women do this??) decide whether they're attracted to some random stranger in ten seconds, most of my relationships start with a friend of a friend who I get to know better.

Looking someone in the eyes for a few seconds and smiling is incredibly intimate. making up nicknames to call people is also a move of intimacy that isn't physical. small gestures like a flower or a note when you're thinking of them. You don't need to roll out all the trauma, but you can say something like, ""sorry, I just need to move slow.""   additionally, and I have no idea if you'd be okay with it, but handholding is really nice. often, my so will hold my hand and just kiss the back of it. its not that physical (an honestly, you're in complete control) but obviously, whatever you're comfortable with."

It can take up to 6 months for me to feel comfortable enough to make out with someone I'm interested in. It's hard to be open with your past, but I've found that people are really understanding when I'm up front about the things that have happened to me. You don't have to go into explicit detail. Maybe say something along the lines of ""I'd really prefer to take things slowly. Really slowly. I've had some bad experiences in my past that I'd rather not get into. If you can't handle that, let me know."" That's my go-to line.   I've also dated my fair share of women, and many of them expect me to make the first move, as well. It sucks. Honestly, online dating helps A LOT. My last girlfriend and I had an online relationship/friendship for a few months before we met in person, and I was able to talk openly about my past and my limitations beforehand. Maybe try keeping things friendly until you feel comfortable enough to take things to the next level. Also you can express interest in other ways! I can't be physical right away, but I can buy flowers, make dinner, shower someone in compliments. Show intimacy in other ways."

And depending on what site I'm reading ""sperm lifespan"" when in the cervix/fallopian tubes are between 1-7 days, which is an estimate that's all over the place.

First off pulling out is more effective than your gym teachers led you to believe, as long as you know, you pull out in time. Second off, Plan B is 95% effective at preventing pregnancies if taken 24 hours after the event. She should not take another dose. That's too much hormones. Third, most sperm die off in the first 12 hours. Vaginal fluid is extremely acidic. The whole ""up to 5 days in optimum conditions"" means exactly that, a few sperm (of your already low load, if you did get any in her) may survive in ""optimum conditions"".. so what are optimum conditions? immediately before she's ovulating, which she's not because of her cycle and she's definitely not because of the shit load of hormones she just took."

I don't want to sound like an asshole and contradict your kind words just because I'm panicked, but sites like this one seem to suggest that it's possible to get pregnant even if the last sexual contact was 5 days before ovulation, which isn't exactly directly before ovulation. And it also falls within the range of when we had sex ...  Sorry. I know this is the ""worst case scenario"". The article above also says that most of them die off within 1-2 days. Wikipedia says most of them die off within 2-3 days. Both of them say 5 days is only the maximum. (Although some sites claim 6-7 days ... but I'll rule that out as being super exceptional)  I just want to know for sure whether or not we're in the clear. Because not knowing is doing a real number on my mental state right now.

Right now its not worth it simply for the anxiety its causing you. The effectiveness of pulling out, along with the effectiveness of natural family planning (actually, you should look this up for info about her cycle), along with the effectiveness of plan B makes this chance so low.   If this is a serious relationship you should both start researching birth control. A local planned parenthood will give you the pill for pretty cheap. They also give a pap smear and a short counseling session. I mean, at least in PA, I don't know if you're from the south. IUDs are more expensive but last five years. Depo shots last a month, but you have to be on time. Nuva rings last a week. There are a ton of options."

But we might also be in the 5% chance of not being in the clear.  I know this panic isn't sustainable. I have a very important month coming up ahead and I can't stay in this mental state for the rest of it. She's noticed how I am too, and she's worried for my sake as well (when I really should be worried for hers, right?). I will try my best to calm down, even if I'm personally terrified at the moment.  I don't live in the United States. I live in an Asian country. I'm not entirely sure what our version of a planned parenthood center is here, but I'll look into it when this scare is over. Suffice to say, we're entirely too anxious right now to really think about if or when we'll experiment again in future."

I think you should be upfront with her before you bang, let her know that you like her and want to have sex if she's down but it's just a booty call to you and nothing more. You stand the risk of not getting any at all, but you also won't leave a girl wondering and expecting more than you can give because girls usually ( not always) want more from a guy and tend to develop feelings after they have sex.   It is very important that you make sure she wants to really bang before you bring it up.

Don't go into your manager's office and complain about how he won't let you call him ""dude,"" though. The pen thing is something I would categorize as irritating but not substantially impacting your work.   If you want to make a complaint, your best case will be if you can create a cause and effect between his actions and your ability to do your work. If you can quantify that, so much the better.  On a personal coping level, just stop chatting with him so much. Take breaks from being around him. Vent about him a lot to good friends. Carry a pen and notebook with you when you talk to him.

So I'll continue to be friendly with my female coworker (who thank god will be returning on Monday), but I'll tone it down with him.

I don't see any way to change her mind on that. You have to accept that this is genuinely how she feels - that she does not and probably will never want to be with you - and decide what to do about that.  The dynamic you currently have with her is pretty obviously unhealthy for you. I think you need to get some space from her. At the very least, you should say, ""I have feelings for you, and when we act flirty and hold hands and kiss each other, it really messes with my emotions. Please don't do those things with me anymore if you don't want to start a relationship."" And then follow up by not holding her hand, maintaining at least three inches of physical space between you at all times, etc.  Honestly, though, I don't think you have the willpower for that. I think you need to tell her that you need some space because this relationship is too confusing and upsetting for you, and then stop talking to her altogether for at least six months or so. Absolutely no communication until you can think about her and not want a relationship with her."

I know Reddit likes to respond to everything with ""dump them""... but the combo of extremely disrespectful words and violent behaviour really is a big warning.  People aren't perfect, so sometimes I can understand when someone chooses to overlook very rare raised voices, saying stupid things, etc. Possibly even a ""get out my way"" shove, though I'd be pretty disturbed if my partner did anything like that to me.

Yes, hypersensitive.   OP tried to make it out like he attacked her apropos of nothing. This is obviously not true, and many people don't react with violence unless the other person started it. If her BF pushed her (onto the bed, btw) after she slapped him, it'd be a lot different than if he randomly lost his shit at her. Somehow the ability to make this distinction is victim-blaming?

But if you want a relationship, pick a site that focuses more on that and be very clear in your profile.

I don't know, maybe it is in my own head, but meeting someone in real life to me just seems a lot more natural.  I posted on this thread looking for a new angle for things, but I may not even need one. Maybe this is just not for me!"
askwomenadvice,3cq7sl,MostlyALurkerBefore,1 point,Fri Jul 10 08:54:57 2015 UTC,"Do you have to use online dating? I don't know...I guess its sort of the standard for our generation now but I really don't think its for everyone. I also can't shake the expectation that all guys I meet online are going to be somewhat creepy and are just incapable of making it work in the real world. Its either that or I assume (especially on something like tinder) that its all guys on the rebound purely looking to order your vagina like its a dominos pizza. Most of the guys I know who are on tinder just got out of relationships and are in shitty desperate mindsets, and most of the guys I know who have an okc or pof are really sad and lonely and have unrealistic expectations of finding their magical soulmates. Those are biases to be either toughed out and learn through experience are false, or just accept and move on. I've seen two guys I met online, they were nice, and I met two friends who I love and it was completely platonic from the start. Its not all bad out there. But if I ever did it again in the future though I would probably still be uncomfortable. Maybe your mind is like mine? That's why I could never do online dating again...I'm too neurotic and its a world that is unfamiliar to me and I think its fine to realize that and look somewhere else.  Part of me feels like meeting someone at a bar or at a show (go to a show alone and stand there and I promise you will get approached by at least someone) is a better alternative. The only other way I could think of fixing it is to plainly state online that you want to look for friends (even if you don't, it just seems to weed out the weirdos and the desperate types). That's my twenty cents. Probably not helpful so i'm sorry, I just have lost most of my faith and interest in online dating and think its just not for some people, myself included. Especially if you have your own biases that will be hard to overcome with online stuff. It can be hard to shake those preconceived notions and if online things are something that make you uncomfortable (which is sounds like) then I think that is a gut feeling worth honoring. As I have learned...the world of online dating is just not for all of us."

Tinder is, from my understanding, specifically geared towards hooking up.  There are plenty of dating sites for people looking for relationships that are more serious. Off the top of my head, there's OkCupid, Match.com, PoF, eHarmony...  Also, your implied superiority over the people/women who use online dating sites probably doesn't help your case.  It's 2015. The internet is a part of our lives in a massive way. People meet people in all sorts of ways, and through the internet doesn't have to be weird or shameful, as you're implying it is.  You're not better than women who use dating sites."

If you want to keep the hair you've got, another option is hats. I personally am turned off by ball caps. I like ""hipster"" hats.  And a third option is IDGAF.

If you wait, you're not hurting anyone.   For some people the cons of parenthood outweigh the pros. Whereas others can overlook the cons because the pros are just so great.   For me, cons; emotional, financial, and physical strain. My health, not wanting to lose my identity, not wanting my relationship with my partner to change, not wanting childbirth... Having to raise a child 24/7, they're dependent on you, less ability to be spontaneous, child may have disabilities... I may not connect/like the child, the child may not connect/like me... I know I'd give up everything for my child, I'd put myself second, I just don't want that.   Pros; experience pregnancy and child birth, have a biological child, see your partner in a new positive way, connect with your child, watch them grow, share your life with them...  I was a fence sitter for a long time. I have no doubts I'd be a good parent, I've been a nanny for a decade, but that doesn't mean I want to be a mom. I'm indifferent. My husband not wanting children helped me decide though.   It was hard at first because society expects us to have kids, breaking norms is hard."

I think you can be ""tricksy"" about it. State in your profile that you're hoping for a partner that you can do whatever sport/physically demanding thing with. Make sure to sound all positive and get-go'y.  That way, if someone isn't into doing those things, they'll weed themselves out, and you don't sound at all rude.

askwomenadvice,3cmnpo,Svataben,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:34:02 2015 UTC,"Some very good points here, thank you for your thoughts.   I haven't seen things like ""I'm not into black guys"" But I have seen the opposite, white girls saying they are only into black men, or oddly lesbians who are listing themselves in the section for women seeking men who then say they are only interested in women (I think they got lost on the way)  ism I thik you are arguing the exception when you say weight isn't always under an individual's control. Regardless, I agree with most people that to point these preferences out seems unnecessarily blunt, and I suppose when I read things like that I do think less of the person saying it.  I like the stealth suggestions re: mentioning activities.   The whole thing seems to me to be a minefield and at [54M] I really don't have a lot of faith in the process."
askwomenadvice,3cmnpo,panyedelnik,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:43:53 2015 UTC,"I've never used a dating site, so feel free to ignore me, but this is how I'd interpret things.  Having preferences is fine but it's always better to frame it in positive, rather than negative terms.  It's a huge minefield because obviously everyone has their own preferences but when you put it as a list of ""criteria"", it comes across badly.  I think that most important thing is to make sure you're not making one-sided demands. For example, if an out-of-shape guy who watches TV all day is posting things like ""I only date slim, athletic women"" that's always going to come across as unreasonable and hypocritical.  But if a guy who is actually fit and athletic writes something like ""I'm really into sport and fitness and maintaining a healthy lifestyle and would like someone who can share those values with me"" then that's probably going to come across as a lot more acceptable.  But ignoring (or politely turning down) people that you're not interested in is also a perfectly valid thing to do, in my opinion.  Also, it's always worth keeping a slight open mind - love can sometimes sneak up and surprise you in ways you'd never have expected!"
askwomenadvice,3cmnpo,accentadroite_bitch,-1,Thu Jul 9 19:37:56 2015 UTC,"I don't think that it's rude. I think it's almost more rude to flat-out ignore a message that you receive without telling them why. If you have that warning on your profile already, the reason should be clear. You know?"
askwomenadvice,3cmnpo,_ism_,-2,Thu Jul 9 15:00:24 2015 UTC,"Weight isn't always under an individual's control. I think it's OK to put some criteria but not others. It kind of depends on your dating pool. The older you get the more you know what you do &  don't like and people expect each other to be able to say those preferences. However when it comes to physical appearance it's more of a minefield.  Don't dating sites have a ticky box for your body type anyway, so you don't have to come out and ask someone? And photos? Photos allow you to decide if this person is attractive to you without having to ask if she's fat. If you can't tell from her photos, ask her for more photos. But I would advise sayiing ""full body shot plz"""

Diet helps.  Limit caffeine, up your water intake.  Enjoy a glass of wine.  Join a support group.  Knowing that other people were just as miserable as me and it wasn't in my head or I wasn't being dramatic was a huge help.    It was a long road.  My intestines fused together.  I have a lot of surgery scars.  It's a shit card to be dealt, but don't stop living your life.  Make goals, know when your bad times of the month are and try not to schedule anything major then.  Cardio and core strength helps tremendously with relief.  Power through it.  Don't be afraid to take pain meds.  Don't wait to take them.    If one doctor isn't solving your problem, go to another.  Don't settle for more hormones, don't settle for ""its normal"".  Don't let them beat you down.  Women doctors can be the cruelest in this regard. Do not let them demean how you feel.    Pain specialist is a good resort.    Last, if you have a mate, or a damn good vibrator, utilize.  Orgasms not only release endorphins, but the contractions help.

Just give her space. You can't make her happy. The only person who can make Ann happy is Ann, and she messed up big time by waiting until you were dating someone else to tell you how she felt.   It would probably make sense to go no contact for a while, after one of you leaves the apartment. She's got to see that you are in love and committed to Cindy.

I mean, we had times before where we didn't see each other for a while. But this just feels different. I just feel that if I tell her to find another place, that I won't ever see her again, that she'll end up hating me.  .. You are right. It's all up to her now. As things are now, even seeing me just gets her down. I just wished it would blow over, things would return to how they were before.  As for my feelings for Ann. Writing down everything, reading everyone's comments made me realize that I loved the person who she used to be. That mysterious girl I know nothing about. That cheerful exciting girl in class that could bring a smile to anyone's face. Ann isn't that person anymore. Not for me. She is my friend now. Someone I feel save with, someone I can talk to, someone I like having around, someone I care for dearly, but not someone I'm still in love with.  Thank you for your advice and insight."

I would find that disrespectful to my relationship, and to me by extension.   Be her friend, that's fine. But don't flirt with her. Yeah, you might end up in the ""friend-zone,"" but she might also end up staying with this guy until she's old and gray.  There's a guy at my job whom I've made small talk with on several occasions, who expressed an interest in me. I told him I have a boyfriend, and he continued to make flirtatious comments (""too bad you have a boyfriend"" and ""I'll be thinking about you"") as if he thinks he can get me anyway. Now I avoid him like the plague. I'm sure you don't want your friend to do the same to you."

You might not be as good of friends after this, but at least you can stop worrying about it, and move on with your life. Staying friends with her while burying these feelings in the end will only bring pain. Sometimes you can't have it both ways and that sucks, but that's life and part of being a human being.  e: There's an important distinction between ""I have feelings for you I'm trying to deal with"" and ""I'm totally going to steal you from your bf,"" it's subtle, but worth noting."

She's someone I not only respect, but seeing the way she lights up when we see each other.   Hold onto that thought tight. She is IN A RELATIONSHIP, and you need to respect that and respect her. Do not tell her you're interested in her romantically. Do not try to get her out of her current relationship. Be platonic friends with her. 100% platonic.  You are literally in the friend zone because you are a friend of hers. The ""friend zone"" is dumb fucking horseshit anyways, complained about by guys who think being friends with someone is a consolation prize instead of a wonderful thing. Kind of sounds like you already realize that your friendship with this person is really important, so you need to either get over the fact that you might never be together, or drop her as a friend, because you're doing neither of you a favor by hanging around and hoping she's eventually single."

It never really bothered me as long as they respected the relationship and didn't take it past wanting to be friends. Personally I would wait until she is single but please respect her and don't do it as soon as they break up, it's really shitty when guys all come on to you as soon as you're single."

You are her friend, end of."
askwomenadvice,3ckobk,xcarex,1 point,Thu Jul 9 13:23:17 2015 UTC,"True. I suppose I was wondering more that... I've heard some women say that, being someone's friend and then asking then out later is also sort of viewed as ""disrespectful"". Which, I dunno, seems kind of strange to me, like ""you're not allowed to be friends with people you're attracted to, or hope that it ever evolves beyond friendship"", but I suppose I've just never had that many friends, so I'm still trying to learn the ""rules"", as it were.  As I said, I have no intentions of causing any sort of rift. If I start to feel like I need to be more than friends, then I'll limit my time around her. In a way, I'm still not quite sure what I'm really feeling anyways; I've never really been ""friends"" with a woman before, nor have I been friends with someone I really kind of admire. The fact that she is also attractive just confuses things. Maybe being friends is really the best thing, not just for her, but for me, too.  Either way, I'm not going to do anything than changes things between us. I'm just trying to focus those feelings into something more productive, improving things about myself. In typically more into self-loathing, but thinking about her makes me feel more optimistic, for some reason."

Respect her choices and decisions.  I really think you don't respect her very much.

The signs and symptoms occur on the same side as the lesion of the sympathetic trunk. It is characterized by miosis (a constricted pupil), ptosis (a weak, droopy eyelid), apparent anhidrosis (decreased sweating), with or without enophthalmus (inset eyeball).  The nerves of the sympathetic trunk arise from the spinal cord in the chest, and from there ascend to the neck and face. The nerves are part of the sympathetic nervous system, a part of the autonomic (or involuntary) nervous system. Once the syndrome has been recognized, medical imaging and response to particular eye drops may be required to identify the location of the problem and the underlying cause.

What one person likes, another thinks is ugly.  There is no magic code word or secret move anyone can teach you for girls to give you a chance.  Every girl in your city isn't fabulously hot, you just completely ignore the ones that aren't. They're invisible to you and you treat them like they're not even there, let alone that they're people. Often interesting, smart, funny, amazing people. Think about that for a moment. Why should any ""hot"" girl give you a chance of you treat unattractive girls so badly that you don't even notice that they exist?  The truth in dating is that everyone gets rejected, a lot. Doesn't matter what they look like. Especially if you're cold approaching a bunch of girls you don't know, even if you're God's gift to women you're going to get shot down 90% of the time. It's part of the game. What you are experiencing is absolutely normal.  If you want to be more successful, approach girls you know and have something in common with. I would never give my number to some stranger who decided I was hot at a bar. It would seriously gross me out that since the only thing he knew about me was what I looked like, he was obviously treating me like a sexual object. Gross."

You have some scars, my neighbour is limping, one of my former class mates had a bald head at the age of 14 etc.   It's important that you look at yourself and highlight the things you're proud about! You say that you like your physique and that you're a great dancer, so show it! Take dancing lessons, join some sports lessons at your gym.... as soon as you do something you love, you're body will show it and you will appear more self-confident to others!

The maturity differences between a 22 year old male and a 16 year old female are so vast, and even if she thinks she wants it now, as she enters her twenties, she will look at 16 year old boys as kids and think back to you with a ""wtf was wrong with him"" attitude.

That might shut it down really quickly for you. When she suggests a hangout, say ""yeah that sounds great! I'll text *brother and invite him too!""  I imagine if she is pursuing romance with you, it is not something she'd want her older sibling to know about, assuming they (like most) wouldn't approve. So when he/she finds out, they'll either do their sibling-ly duties and give her hell for it, or tag along merrily because this is one big platonic family fun outing. You're keeping your end of it innocent, and forcing them to do so too.   This may not be a great idea depending on your relationship with the family, but by including the other family members, you're indicating to her that a) you think this hangout is purely platonic and want to keep it that way and b) you're essentially telling on yourself (You're notifying the family that you two have been talking/planning a hangout first, so should they ever see a text exchange or find out you two have been seeing each other and she didn't tell them, they can't assume you were pursuing her/pressuring her/ etc)."

Of course, I dont know what type of person she is. Maybe the nervous laughing is because she likes you, maybe it isnt.  Honestly, I think you should just ask her. From my perspective (thinking it was an accident) I would say ""So Im pretty sure you texted me by accident, but its still been really nice to catch up; I havent seen you in ages""... Ok, I know you just told me that she was there when you were visiting etc etc, that was just a sample message. Then if she responds with ""no it wasnt an accident, why would you think that?"" you can say that it was a very welcome text but very out-of-the-blue.

Seeing it like you have to impress the entire gender collectively just makes it seem bigger than it is and doesn't help you figure out a woman's individual likes/dislikes.  What do you talk about on dates?  Do you contribute to the conversations?  Did she say why she didn't feel attracted?  Do you have things in common with the women you ask out?  What makes you ask them out?   As far as general tips: be interesting and interested (have hobbies, opinions, points of interest, don't just agree with everything she says or make the convo all about her), listen, don't be clingy, don't wait for ages before asking someone out, and don't be a total doormat.    You could also consider your sense of style, personal hygiene and hair.  You don't have to drastically change anything but if you're out to impress, you should put some effort into looking as good as you can.  Brushed teeth and hair, fitted clothes, a good haircut if you really need one, and a light cologne can go a long way."

Though usually we'll have similar tastes in other media like tv shows and books and what not.

If she has not complained, if she has not said she's dissatisfied, then right now you don't need to worry because she had not raised this as a concern.  You should also make sure you're good at the other things that can bring her pleasure so your size isn't the only focus.  There are many more things that turn a woman on in bed.  Oral sex, grinding or rolling your hips during sex, different positions, nipple play, teasing, sex toys etc.  There's lots of ways to make sex fun so you're not so focused on ""Am I big enough?"" since that's never been the most important or essential thing anyway."

I kept that up for more than half a year by the time I told her that I wanted to ask out a girl, but that I was too nervous to do it. I wanted her to think that I was subtly trying to tell her that I wanted to ask her out, and she ended up believing it.  I did that for more than a week, and she finally asked me out, thinking that's what I wanted. I told her that she wasn't the girl that I wanted to ask out, and then I said some other really mean things to her that I knew would hurt her. She ended up crying and leaving.

This is common sense that normal humans feel.  You've shown yourself to be dangerous multiple times. Shall we go through it all?  You ""did something similar"" to telling a suicidal person to kill themselves. You are unsafe if you've even come close to goading suicide.  You've stated that you feel the overwhelming urge to have fantasies of death in order to climax. You didn't start out that way - your fantasies have escalated. Escalation from fantasy to real life happens too.  You said this in the thread I linked above:    I mean that I feel an overwhelming urge to fulfill those violent fantasies.   You yourself admit that these fantasies interfere with real life to the point there they may ""prevent [you] from obtaining and maintaining a healthy relationship.""  Again in the above linked thread you once again state:   It's gotten to the point where a woman's death is almost always involved when I climax.   Despite people on handfuls of subs telling you these thoughts are dangerous and you should get therapy, you refused to and stated ""don't think these thoughts will ever completely go away.""  YOU'VE TORTURED ANIMALS. YOU ADMITTED TO IT YOURSELF, YOU HAVE PERFORMED PHYSICALLY VIOLENT ACTS. People who torture animals often lose enjoyment of the act and move onto people.    I tortured and killed animals, albeit rarely, starting at around five years old. The first animal I tortured was a cat that had eaten a family of wild doves I had grown attached to. I trapped the cat, and then tortured it for what felt like a very long time, until it finally died. It was around that time that I started realizing I cold derive sexual pleasure from hurting others.   You have admitted you want to act on your violent thoughts. You fucking admitted it.  You admit a second time that you are concerned you'll graduate from hurting animals to people.  You, an admittedly violent person who tortured animals and dreams of torturing people. You want a fucking gun.  I'm sorry but you are dangerous, you are self-admittedly dangerous and your therapist needs to know these things. How the hell can a person trust you'll ""never hurt a woman in real life"" when you hurt animals and admit you want to act on your fantasies? You're already guilty of harming living things and emotionally harming people. Questioning people's advice on the assload of posts you make about your insanity will not make your problematic mindset and behaviours go away. You repeatedly ask for advice on how to deal with it, and when people tell you how to deal with it, you reject the advice. Please just accept that your therapist needs to know about this shit and you are in a very wrong mindset that needs fixing before you go near women. You are a violent man with violent thoughts who is already emotionally abusing women. Please step back."

You repeatedly ask for advice on how to deal with it, and when people tell you how to deal with it, you reject the advice.   That's not true. The reason I'm in therapy right now is because I took the advice of people on reddit. I just don't like it when people disrespect me.   You are a violent man with violent thoughts who is already emotionally abusing women.   No, I'm not violent. The only time I can think of where I've hurt a girl is when a girl tickled me without my permission, and kept tickling me after I yelled at her to stop, so I threw her to the ground.  As for the rest of your post, I first I thought you were just being judgmental, but after checking your profile, I found out you were raped. So I understand why you would be worried about any possible threat I might pose to a woman. But here's the thing: I know that I will never hurt a woman, and my therapist has agreed with me that it's unlikely that I would ever act on my fantasies.  And for the record, I no longer torture animals. And I tortured the cats out of revenge for killing  a family of doves that I loved. I didn't do what I did in cold blood. I was also a little kid when I tortured animals. I no longer do that. That shows that I'm getting better.  I'd also like to mention that the vast majority of people that tortured animals when they were young don't grow up to be serial killers. Yes, most serial killers do start off torturing animals. And most people addicted to meth also tried alcohol before they started taking meth. That doesn't mean that everyone who tried alcohol will end up addicted to meth."

As long as you are using protection and feel safe in what you are doing, that's all that matters.   Speaking of preference, I actually think sex is a good thing. In addition to its obvious reproductive benefits (for those who want that) I think it's a major form of social bonding. Some people go out every weekend with their friends for years. They meet lots of new friends/acquaintances and enjoy it. Others prefer to have smaller groups of friends and don't enjoy going out very frequently. As long people are being safe (responsible drinking, etc.) it does not matter how many people they interact and bond with. There's no need to compare numbers or feel bad about your chosen way."

Don't cheese it up, or the rejection will be more awkward and could potentially damage the relationship you already have. Confidence is really key, if you just pipe up and ask her like you've done it 1000 times she'll notice and want to go out with you.

Still, if it only remains a friendship I'm content with that, and I think she feels the same.  The trouble though is when I'm pursuing friendship and really trying to do that honorably, and yet the other person catches feelings and things get awkward and I have no choice but to hurt the other person by telling them I don't feel that way. I have another friend, this one from school, who I have to see all the time because of classes for the next year or more.

It's a natural, organic process.    Success in attracting a long-term mate is as simple as making yourself into an interesting person that a special someone would want to be around.  Participate in activities. Make friends.  Laugh.  Enjoy yourself.  If you share an interest with a woman, you‚Äôll have an automatic conversation starter that might evolve into something else.

Her radar is set to avoid that.  Don't be on the prowl for her.  Women sense that.  Just enjoy your life and she will swirl into it when you least expect.  The odds that my husband and I would eventually get together were astronomically low.  We were from different countries and doing very exclusive jobs.  A third party messed up the paperwork that would have put us into the same room.  But a fourth party inexplicably decided to waive the requirements.  For some reason, we did meet, and the rest is history.  I was attracted to my husband 26 years ago because he was intelligent and interested in the world, he had a fascinating job, he liked adventure, he came from a similar background to me, and we had similar life goals.  He wasn't the best-looking guy around, but he had a confidence and sincerity that made me feel really comfortable around him. He was, and is, the only guy I ever met that I could have married.   His 'edge', if you will, was that he loved travelling and was a good companion, always finding the fun in the ordinary.  He made me long to see new things through his eyes.  Where I think you may be going wrong:   I'm genuinely looking to find future wife material.   This sounds so stark, almost like you're in the market for a new consumer product.  Are you looking for a plastic fantastic, or a likeable companion who would like to experience life's journey with you?   I ... have what it takes to really attract her and keep her.   If you are looking for a show piece, a beautiful woman who values material goods and the man who can give them to her, then you'll have to work hard to attract and keep her.  If you are looking for an authentic human being, then being kind and genuinely interested in her life is really all it takes.   ...do any of you put any stock in ANY books or materials out there for attracting ladies?    Any time I hear a man call a woman a lady, I get an icky feeling inside.  Many women don't mind this, but a lot of thoughtful women don't like it.  A lady is a woman with a certain value judgment placed on her by another person.  I am a human being first and foremost.  I don't want anyone to judge me by my 'lady' qualities because I'm uncomfortable being wedged into a pre-set feminine mold.  I guarantee that if you saw a photo of me, you would think I was a very kind, feminine woman.  I dress fashionably, wear jewelry, color my hair and smile a lot.  But I also value my own professionalism, strength and resilience.  My husband knows that I am capable of handling most things on my own, but he also knows that I prefer our team approach.  I‚Äôm proud of being a woman.  You have to decide if you are looking for a lady - someone who fits a predetermined set of ideals - or a woman - someone who is herself.  Maybe you really are looking for a lady instead of a woman.  That‚Äôs okay, it‚Äôs your choice.  But just know that you may have to work a lot harder to attract and keep her, and you‚Äôll never be sure if you‚Äôre good enough if things go wrong.  A woman will be interested in you for your own sake, not for what you can give her.  If you still want some self-help materials, then there is a video that I watched recently and would recommend.  Go to youtube and search on: How to Hold Conversation Like a Man - Nick Sparks.  His theory is that most men talk about themselves too much.  He thinks you should encourage a woman by actively listening.  He‚Äôs not 100% right, in my opinion, but the men I was attracted to gave me the idea that they were truly as interested in me as I was in them.  Good luck."

I really like what you shared, especially    Success in attracting a long-term mate is as simple as making yourself into an interesting person that a special someone would want to be around   and    Once you come out of the moment and start analyzing your behavior vis-a-vis a woman, you've stopped doing whatever it is that she wants more of and you‚Äôve become a manipulator.   I've been actually been thinking about everything I said from my original post for a while now, and as it's gone on I've occasionally wondered if I've just been overthinking everything, and whether I should only at all just focus on making my currently solo life to be everything I want it to be. As you described it, I genuinely do want a woman whom I appreciate, respect and love for all of who she is, and for her to feel and do the same for me.  Btw, I love the team approach you mentioned that you have with your husband. You don't necessarily need each other, but want to approach life together. Love it and I want that too. I also love how your husband's ""edge"" that you mentioned just consisted of organic qualities in him, rather than him having all the right words, etc. Seriously thanks for sharing!"

askwomenadvice,3ca5ob,MuppetManiac,9,Mon Jul 6 18:03:34 2015 UTC,"No, the PUA stuff is mostly misogynistic crap, and the few small scraps of good advice are things you can find in any self-help book: cultivate a social circle, get in shape and be good to your body, and make sure you meet basic standards of hygiene. A bit of self-reflection will get you a lot farther than anything you'll read in those books, subreddits, etc. For instance, you said all of your relationships have failed at some point. How come? What was your part in that failure? You don't have to answer those questions publicly, but you should think carefully about them.  Also, something else to think about: creating and maintaining a good  relationship is a skill (or rather, a set of skills), and just like other skills, there is a theoretical component and a practical component. So, staying single and reading about good communication techniques and how to argue fairly can help you in your next relationship, but you can also only get so far with reading alone in your room. At some point, you have date other people and try and practice what you have been reading in order to really improve.  But in the meantime if you're looking for something to read, go check out The Gottman Institute blog."

Looked around The Red Pill for a while and found a tiny bit of gold mixed in a load of hate-fueled junk, which led me here thinking there had to be better advice out there. Speaking of which, yours is great. You just made me revisit those times in the past when my relationships failed, and I realized that some of those negative qualities in me haven't been resolved yet.  Also, I totally agree that real practice is more important than reciting theory, I just don't want to lead anyone on at this point so it feels unfair to ""practice"".   I forgot about Gottman!

askwomenadvice,3ca3zh,Rowsdowerr,4,Mon Jul 6 08:05:01 2015 UTC,"Personally, I would never cheat.   Look for someone with the same values. Basically think about whether a partner seems to put a high value on fidelity and communication."
askwomenadvice,3ca3zh,wobblebase,4,Mon Jul 6 13:51:24 2015 UTC,The cause of cheating is selfishness and dishonestly on their part not lack of attention on yours. You can't keep a cheater from cheating and that's the end of it. It has nothing to do with you.
askwomenadvice,3ca3zh,Bucolic_Intent,0,Mon Jul 6 13:55:01 2015 UTC,"No, this is the type of... Idealistic(?) answer that oversimplifies things. It's often from people who were cheated for no good reason. There's a lot of reasons people cheat. It doesn't all boil down to that.   The biggest reason cheating seems to happen is when 1) needs aren't being met and 2) escaping the relationship is hard or impossible. Attention is one of those needs. Ignoring your s/o emotionally, physically, and/or intimately absolutely can create a frustrated partner who feels lonely and worthless. It's easy to just say, ""Well, then leave them!"" When one hasn't been in a situation where leaving will have severe consequences or is borderline impossible. It's a two way street. When you're constantly disrespect and/or abused, it's easy to become a trapped animal and cheat to have affection and a feeling of normalcy and value."

And when someone is being a dough bag and choosing to cheat rather than address the issues in a relationship. I don't think any happy relationship where all your emotional and physical needs are being met will provoke someone to look elsewhere. Doesn't mean if that isn't happening that someone should, or has a reason or excuse to cheat. Just saying I think it all boils down to how you make someone feel. Everyone needs and wants different things to feel emotionally fulfilled, appreciated, secure and loved. I like to find out what makes my partner feel appreciated and loved, and then go out of my way to do those things if it doesn't already come naturally to me to do those things."
askwomenadvice,3c9nzl,Ilovecaptainhook,2,Mon Jul 6 04:38:10 2015 UTC,"That was really hard to read. First of all, ""the populars"" are people. Don't dehumanize them by neglecting that fact. It helps you to not put them on a pedestal.   The advice you need, but probably won't follow is this. Be who you want to be, and do what you want to do. Do not score your life on how many of the right people like you. Think, for a moment, about how popular people become popular. Not by mimicking someone else, but by rocking what they have and not caring what other people think."
askwomenadvice,3c9nzl,MuppetManiac,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:39:17 2015 UTC,"First of all, embrace being a dork. The dorks are the interesting people and I guarantee you, they will end up with the friends that stick around and mean so much more than the ""popular"" girls.  Secondly, is there any reason you WANT to hang out with the popular girls? Other than ""fitting in""? Never, ever change who you are just to make it easier to fit in. Nothing you do to fit in will actually make you happy. It'll feel great for a while, I'm sire, but eventually, you'll get tired of it.   You're going to hate me for saying this but - you're still young. There are so many people to meet and once you leave school, those popular people will be back to be being no one. Having been prom king/queen doesn't matter outside of school. Having been popular won't get you a job, or a family, or a friend in life beyond high school.   The best thing you can do is focus on you. Work hard on your grades and what you love doing hobby-wise. Learn to love yourself for being a dork. People should learn to love their own company, because when you're alone you're all you've got!   Someone will come along or you'll find them and they will befriend you BECAUSE you aren't fawning around the popular people, because you did your own thing and you were happy to be different.  There is absolutely no shame in being different so embrace it and be happy."
askwomenadvice,3c72aj,MeMrPenetration,19,Sun Jul 5 13:58:16 2015 UTC,In all 3 pic you look like you are working so-damn-hard to be cool. You also don't look like you're having fun. How about something where you're smiling. (Keep the pic with the dog though.)  I don't use Tinder so I don't know how long your profile can be. But one sentence would be enough info for me.
askwomenadvice,3c72aj,wobblebase,18,Sun Jul 5 19:06:12 2015 UTC,"You're definitely not ugly but that profile sucks.

askwomenadvice,3c72aj,octo-ais,10,Sun Jul 5 14:56:55 2015 UTC,"Girls tend to be a lot pickier than guys on Tinder. At least in my experience. I have about 100 guy matches and maybe 3 girl matches.

Which is fine, but it can feel objectifying. I use tinder for easy hook ups all the time, and that would really turn me off and I wouldn't engage, even though I'm specifically looking just for casual fun.   You aren't bad looking, but your first two pictures just enable the persona I detailed above. The first pic is angry, the next pic makes you look like a guido dudebro. I actually really like the last pic, as I'm a sucker for dogs. It makes you look more approachable, too.   Go to /r/tinder and just steal someone's bio, honestly, that's witty, short, and fun. Then change up your pictures."

You're actually pretty conventionally attractive so don't feel bad about being ugly because you're not.   You don't look very genuine in any of your pictures nor are you smiling in any of them though. Even the ones at a concert and holding your dog (two things that people do to make themselves happy) you're just posing for the camera.   Tinder is all about hookups and fun times.

askwomenadvice,3c72aj,RunningUpThtHill,2,Mon Jul 6 06:32:25 2015 UTC,"You're... Actually really attractive to me. The problem is your bio. That's what would make me swipe left. Your current bio comes off as rushed and just looking for a meaningless fling. A well written bio is as important as being attractive. I don't know if we have anything in common. I'm not interested in risking conversing with someone, finding out we have nothing in common, rejecting them, and having them freak out. Not saying you'd do that, but it happens a lot and I don't know which men will and won't. Even if I am looking for a meaningless fling, I want to know a bit about the person. I'm less likely to come back for more if I find out they're awkward, edgy, uninteresting, or a bigot.  Don't go generic either. For example: Don't be like, ""I'm a fun guy in college who loves music, politics, the outdoors, and art."" Say, ""I'm an outgoing 19 year old guy attending UCLA for Engineering. I love rocking out at shows! Punk and hardcore is my jam and my favorite bands are NOFX, Code Orange Kids, and Sex pistols. I'm democratic socialist and would be elated to find a person to discuss politics with casually. When I need to wind down I enjoy a nice hike in the morning with my dog and sometimes go fishing with my granddad. Though, during bad whether or a lazy day, I like to do figure drawing."" That tells me a lot more about you and makes me more likely to swipe right."
askwomenadvice,3c72aj,VeganDog,1 point,Mon Jul 6 15:48:11 2015 UTC,"No, you're not ugly. But your profile is crappy! Follow the other advice about improving it.  As well as improving your profile, if you're swiping that many girls, my guess is you're just doing it for anyone you think is attractive. Be more selective. If you swipe for someone you have something in common with (a passion for jazz, or rock climbing etc),.that's an extra thing in your favour and a girl is more likely to want to connect with you."

I stop him, we back up, switch positions, and put me in control. Five minutes later, I've got sensation back, and I'm on the train to orgasm town. But 12 years of sexual activity and knowing my body intimately and what gets it off is why I'm able to do that.  I'm assuming you haven't been sexually active for a very long time, because I certainly wouldn't put up with sex like that forever. I think it's more likely to be inexperience or a lack of arousal or something than birth control.  Have you ever felt pleasure from your vulva? With masturbation? Toys? Do you want to have sex?

You risk setting a negative tone for your future with her.  Get to know her, let her see that you will treat her with care and respect. Treating her gently now will reap years of reward in your future together."

If you're being met with blocks then stop. If you continue then that's technically harassment at that point and things could get even uglier.

I was playing a flash game in Firefox because Chrome is being weird with flash lately. After I was done with the game, I opened up Facebook not realizing I was still in Firefox and was logged into her page. I saw she had a new message from Tom and thought the message was strange so I looked at the conversation history.   So yes, I did snoop a little bit but only after seeing the initial message by accident.   I usually contact her by Skype or Facebook which she has access to through her laptop that is at the hotel she is staying in.

askwomenadvice,3c3pt3,ITCrownJen,3,Sat Jul 4 21:50:46 2015 UTC,"Because you were brought up with money and she wasn't it's entirely possible that you know how to handle money and she doesn't. You can't expect her to know how to manage a resource she's never had access to. But if you keep covering for her, she'll never learn to manage her resources.   I would tell her that if she can't afford the rent, then she needs to move out. Maybe that's harsh, but she's expecting you to subsidize her lifestyle and that's not ok by me. Sounds like it's not ok by you either. And she needs to know that. She needs to lose the entitlement to your money. You're already helping her out tremendously by paying 70% of the rent.    You need to approach her with ""I"" statements. ""I feel taken advantage of when you don't pay your share of the rent."" ""I worry that this will become a regular thing."" ""I'm not comfortable with giving you money."" And you need to sit down and talk to her about why she's having trouble. There are lots of systems out there to help people cut back on spending. One of the most effective ones I know is not carrying cards. You get the cash for that week out of the bank, and then you only carry cash. You can't spend what you don't have. But every single one of them takes self discipline. And when she knows you'll cover for her, there's no need to have self discipline. You're enabling her.

Have it be an automatic bank transfer. Same for other important allocations, like retirement and savings accounts (though these are done on an individual bases). Then, whatever you each have left you are free to spend however you want.

askwomenadvice,3by84t,Throwaway122186,5,Fri Jul 3 03:31:53 2015 UTC,"so, to be clear, the TLDR is she has so far insisted on condoms but your ability to stay hard suffers from wearing them. Correct? how does that relate to how frequently you two have sex? I know it sounds like I'm asking rhetorically, but I'm asking sincerely. Is it that not being able to perform (stay hard? Climax?) wears down on you emotionally so you turn down sex more? Or does she not wanna have sex with you that frequently cuz you can't stay hard? Or some other option I'm (likely) missing?  I ask because those two issues aren't necessarily related in my head, so i wanna make sure that they ARE causally related in your case. More on that in a sec.    Regarding condoms: in terms of the debate, I firmly side with the camp that says that the ""no sensation"" excuse is bullshit. That said, I don't have a penis. Either way, you don't have to suck it up NOR bring it up formally with the fianc√©,  there's actually a 3rd alternative -- do something about it on your own by switching your approach to condoms. You should be jerking of with a condom on to get used to the sensation. You should also be putting the condom earlier during sex, not right before insertion, because you need to make some time for the latex to warm up to match the temperature of your skin. Those two things tend to markedly improve sensation for men. Try putting a little (condom-safe) lube on your shaft and especially the tip of your dick before rolling the condom on. also, make sure your condom isn't too tight or too loose: I used to have a fuck buddy who didn't like condoms either and it turned out that he was wearing a size that was too tight. Once he switched over to a larger size he was fine. Additionally, you could experiment with other kinds of condoms that aren't latex (eg: lambskin). Some woman recently wrote a large piece on condoms that was extremely informative, I'll try to dig it up for you as soon as I get home. And, if all else fails, you still have the option of pulling out, taking the condom off, and finishing yourself off and cuming in her mouth or her tits as part of your sex play if you're not doing it already.  At any rate, your girlfriend has a right to insist on condoms (they have the added bonus of protecting you both from STDs should either of you stray and/or should you ever decide to open up your relationship). That said, it's wonderful that you want to accommodate, but clearly martyrizing yourself over it isn't doing you or her any favors in the bedroom. So give that stuff a shot and if not then yeah, have a conversation about it. I would clue her in to the fact that this is going on and that you wanna experiment with it before you formally ask her to agree to going condomless.    That should solve your condom problem and your sex frequency problem if they are, in fact, related. If they're not, then something else is going on that I think is worth paying attention to. Your sexual satisfaction matters a LOT in this relationship, because if one of you is unsatisfied it throws a wrench into the whole thing. You may say that you're willing to go without now, but you're going to be changing your tune in 5, 10, 20 years. Because the reality is that the sex frequency is only going to get worse with marriage and kids and getting older. That's why you both need to lay your cards on the table and have a frank conversation about what you both want and need and continue revisiting that conversation for the rest of your lives together. Her laughing off your needs (even if the condom-sensation thingy is kinda silly) is not ok. You need to be heard, and the fact that you mention this is a totally open and trusting relationship but are still asking us for an OK before you go talk to her doesn't really bode well for the level of communication in your relationship. Maybe I'm wrong, but it's definitely something to think about and sort through before you go down the aisle.   Good luck!   EDIT: Found it!"

She herself is a kindergarten teacher though, and absolutely loves kids [Hates her job because of the administration, but not the kids]. Quite often we will sit on the couch at night laughing and planning on how some day she's going to make a great stay at home mom. Don't get me wrong, we want kids someday absolutely, but not anytime soon, since we kind of feel like we are still kids ourselves.

I suggest thinking a bit harder about whether condoms are the issue, or just a visible proxy for the issue. Would changing that make a lasting difference or just bump underlying problems a bit further down the road with a temporary boost in excitement? I suspect the latter, personally.

Over the years he developed a slight allergy as he got older to latex, and though we do use the natural ones, he did not like them and our sex live went down hill.    We discussed vasectomy as an option, and he had it done and we haven't had any issues, though we still use condoms most of the time, knowing he is shooting blanks helps ease my mind about accidental pregnancy.  Though I've read stories that some vasectomys may not be fully done, so I am religious about tracking my cycles and have a few OTC pregnancy tests in the house just in case."

Kids at school do a good enough job at pointing out flaws, so it's nice to have a safe space with a parent.  Also, one of the best things my dad did for me was to never treat me like a girl. He never let me get away with anything ""because I was a girl."" He challenged me, was extremely honest, and in general treated me like he expected the best from me in all things - school, sports, social life, chores, being a role model for my younger brother, etc. I know girls tend to get a pass from their dads, and my dad never did that, which made me a much stronger, confident person today.

askwomenadvice,3bwvgw,Rowsdowerr,5,Thu Jul 2 20:49:49 2015 UTC,"There was this amazing book when I was younger from American Girl that I think was called The Care and Keeping of You. It was fantastic. Not only did it talk about periods but also shaving legs, friends, relationships, boobs, bras, EVERYTHING. Basically any embarrassing question a young girl might have, it answered. I'd say read it, or something like it, and give it to your daughter.   I think the main thing I would have liked when I was young is for adults not to make a big deal out of things. Your daughter wants to shave her legs? Buy her a good razor and cream. She needs tampons? Ok add them to the grocery list. Just be supportive of the choices your daughter makes for her body."

For example, sometimes when you sleep you might leak blood onto your sheets. It's totally normal and happens to every girl. Just rinse your sheets with hot water then wash as normal. You also get blood on your underwear sometimes so make sure to change tampons or pads frequently. Also talk to her about odor, she way need to wash with unscented soap down there especially during periods. As a young girl, these things were scary to me since no one talked to me about periods and such. You're doing an awesome job just by posting on here :)"

Personally, I think it'd also be a good idea to start learning more about why feminism exists and some of the issues that she'll face as she grows up - if that's something you're not already doing. Dealing with sexist behaviour, unwanted/inappropriate touch, etc. Understanding consent and how important it is for her to respect her right to say ""no"" rather than go along with something to be polite/nice or out of fear.

askwomenadvice,3bwvgw,iiiinthecomputer,3,Fri Jul 3 10:33:05 2015 UTC,"Best advice I ever got from my mother was this: If someone is saying bad things about you behind your back, it says more about them than it does about you.  The best thing you can do is treat all the women in your life with respect and dignity. Take them at their word. Assume they mean what they say. Let your daughter see that this is how women should be treated. As adult human beings of equal standing. If she has a good solid model of what women should be treated like at home, she'll accept nothing less from friends and lovers. If you wouldn't want a teenage boy to treat your daughter that way, never treat any woman that way (not even your ex, not even if she deserves it.)  By 12, I had already had the mechanics of sex explained, already started getting my period, was already well on my way to being biologically an adult woman. The most powerful thing I wish my parents had taught me, but they didn't, was how to say no. Was how to say I don't want to do that. I'm uncomfortable with that. And not to back down, and to expect my no to mean something. I stayed in a relationship with a guy for more than a year after I knew I didn't really want to be with him, because I didn't have a good reason to break up with him. He was nice to me, so I was supposed to like him back. And I didn't say ""No, I'd rather you didn't kiss me."" Even though after we'd make out I'd cry in my bedroom because I hadn't wanted to. Make it perfectly acceptable for her to say no to things, just because she doesn't want to."

I have to be a role model for the kind of man my daughter will date, which means respecting her, and other women, which isn't always something I've been the best about.  One of the things about having your life messed up like mine has is it's allowed me to reevaluate my priorities, and although I was a good dad before, I'm bound and determined to become a better one.    Maybe you can help me with a follow up question:  One of my specific worries is that if I take my wife back that my daughter will learn that it's okay to be cheated on, and that if she does she'll look to my example and stay in a bad situation."
askwomenadvice,3bwvgw,WorldStopCarryOn,3,Thu Jul 2 20:56:20 2015 UTC,I think that seriously depends on the situation under which you take her back. Is she remorseful? Willing to be transparent? Willing to move away from her boyfriend? What about the baby? Would taking her back put you back in a relationship where your wife doesn't respect you?   This doesn't sound like a situation where you could take your wife back and show your daughter what self respect looks like. It's one thing when what you are modeling that people make mistakes and it's ok to forgive them. It's another when what you are modeling is that it's ok to let someone walk all over you in a relationship. Only you know which situation this is.

But you can't make them want to end a bad relationship. If THEY decide they want to end it, they will. They'll block the guy on social media, lose his number and go no contact. If they don't want to do that, nothing you say or do can make them, and calling them losers is only going to drive a wedge between you and your friends.   So, your choices are to back off and be supportive of their choices, even if you don't agree with them, so that you can be there when they are ready to leave, or tell them you can't be supportive anymore and stop talking to them about it."

It certainly confused the rest of us going by other people's responses. You obviously really like her as a person but if you aren't physically attracted to her that means she's your friend. What is most important is that you don't lead her on using her as an ego boost. She makes you feel really good about yourself and that seems to be where your confusion comes from. Part of you wants to be with her because of the way she makes you feel? Be brutally honest with yourself. Don't do that to someone. From your description of her actions she certainly seems romantically interested in you and it would be cruel to ""keep her on the hook"" if you don't feel the same way."

Physical affection is not necessarily a ""move"" and if it is, she likes you.  It's not an opportunity grab, she's a person showing affection.     After 2 days of remembering everything after drinking. I realized that I was in love.    No, this is infatuation.  She told you everything you want to hear, you don't actually know her at all yet.  You could get to know her and find out she really is as great as she seems, but for now, just know you can't determine love within two days and it's a bad idea to catch feelings for someone who spoke to you nicely while they were drunk.  People are notoriously more affectionate while drunk.   All I wanted to be was a friend and protector because I felt like she was a little sister that I needed to protect.   That's...a different kind of love to a crush.  Familial love is not the same as romantic love.     Her kindess really touched my heart, and saying I wasn't fat was all I needed to hear.    What about her though?  Away from what she said to you, about you, what do you know of HER?  What is she insecure about?  What bad habits does she have?  What makes her who she is?   I still don't know what to make of that. What does this MEAN?   Should be obvious.  You said you felt familial and protective of her and she could obviously tell which is why she called on you and shows affection.  It doesn't mean either of you have a crush on each other, you're just close and she seems like a nice person.     It just sucks because we're only like this when we're drunk. We only do small talks when sober.   So invite her to coffee with you.  Aim to contact her during the day while 100% sober.   I'm not looking for anything more than being a friend.

If he hasn't touched your breasts in SIX MONTHS, it means he hasn't taken your needs into consideration ever. From that long description of yours, one thing is pretty clear- You are way too worried about your physical appearance and that's eating you up. This paranoia can itself reflect in your body language and make you look actually unattractive.   One thing you need to know is, you don't have to change for anyone. You don't have to be everything he has dreamed for in a girl. Its not your responsibility to meet up to his dreams. If he has chosen to be with you, he must have been attracted to you. Also, he should be in love with you as a person and not with your body. Since you are not able to convince yourself of that fact, the easiest thing for you to do is WORKOUT. Atleast for 45 mins a day. Not because it can help you conform to the social standards of beauty but because it will help you be more comfortable and relaxed with your own body and it will give you a feeling that you are putting in some effort to tone your body.   That said, I want you to know that there is nothing wrong in being Fat. I am a ""fat""girl. I am totally confident about my body and least bothered about my waist size.

askwomenadvice,3bwa7i,Bitchibo,3,Thu Jul 2 18:16:50 2015 UTC,"When we started dating a year ago I was 160lbs (jobs with unlimited food made me gain about 20lbs). I am now almost 190lbs.  ...he loves my butt... I hate my body shape...  I have never, ever had breasts. At 190lbs, size 12 or 14 pants, I am a 38B. I regularly get mistaken for a boy unless I dress super femininely. My boyfriend is a boob guy.    Geez, I'm a 12/14 and while my spare tire irritates me I don't consider myself fat :/   I'm willing to bet money you're wearing the wrong bra size. Therefore some of your breast tissue has migrated. What is your underbust, bust standing, and bust hanging measurements? (Don't do it over clothes). I bet once you're in the right size and your tissue is put in the right place you'll like your breasts a bit better. (You could also check out /r/abrathatfits).   My weight goes to my stomach, and it is not in any way attractive. Over the last 6 months 4 separate close friends/family members have asked me if I was pregnant. I'm not. I have a double chin for the first time in my life.   I sometimes get asked. It's rude to ask. If you don't like your weight change your lifestyle.   I also have blond hair. I happen to like my hair color and think it's kinda pretty, but this is the fourth of four boyfriends who didn't like blonds and has told me they preferred brunettes and don't find my hair attractive. Not in a mean way, I know I'm making it sound really douchey.   So your boyfriend has told you; he likes your butt but thinks your fat, he wishes you had bigger boobs, and he doesn't like your hair?   Or do you just think, that even though he started dating you at 160lbs, that he doesn't like it. That even if he likes big boobs that he doesn't also like your boobs... That he likes brunettes but that doesn't mean he doesn't like blonds?    He doesn't find me attractive. He's told me I'm beautiful and he loves me... but he's also told me he knows since he's a bit overweight he isn't going to be dating a supermodel and he has to settle. The women he's dated in the past are all uniformly skinny and gorgeous. I mean LITERAL models. Fucking beautiful perfect-looking women. One's had breast implants, the rest are all natural.   Why are you dating him? You don't date someone to settle and you don't date someone you think you can change, you accept them for who they are.    I feel sick when I look at myself in the mirror and he doesn't even look down when I walk into the room naked. We never have sex anymore. He never touches me sexually or cutely unless it's to smack my butt. He hasn't touched my breasts in over 6 months.   Again, why are you dating him? He makes you feel like shit...    I need to figure out how to deal with knowing my partner isn't attracted to me.   Break up    TL;DR: How do I come to terms with being the exact opposite of what my partner likes physically?   If he has a preference, that's fine. It doesn't mean he still doesn't enjoy you. If he is settling, making you feel badly about yourself, break up."

Yeah, every well-adjusted adult knows you don't find a perfect partner, because no one is perfect.

He told you he knows he has to settle?! There is no excuse for that. A boyfriend who loves you and cares about you, even if you're not ""his type"" would take your insecurities and do what he can to alleviate them. Instead he's withholding physical intimacy and doesn't seem interested in doing anything to encourage a healthier lifestyle for the two of you to get into together. I suggest a serious discussion about your feelings and ways he could make you feel more supported - like physical intimacy and trying out healthier diets and activities together. If he can't get on board with that, I don't see the situation getting much better. You don't have to be his type in order for him to love you - but he does have to be willing and able to support you and show you that he loves you."

Sort of like being a born again christian. You really have to find your true self and have a hard time not taking it to the extreme. Switch roles for a moment. You are drinking and having a good time and she says to you, ""Hey, maybe try to get some sleep soon so you're not so hungover when I get there"". Is this ok? And if you started yelling at her saying ""don't tell me what to do!"" you know what you would be? An asshole. She's being an asshole. I don't think she means to be but if you shouldn't be talking to her that way then she should not be talking to you that way. That is actual gender equality. Respect on both ends. Now when you confront her about this I highly suggest using ""When you said __, I felt __"". If she cares about you she will care about how her words made you feel. Though expect her to be very defensive at first. It's hard to accept when you have been a jerk.  When I met my now husband, I was (and still am a feminist of course) not only a feminist but i was one that had very limited contact with men. And there were a lot of kinks to work out at first because I just was not used to being with the opposite gender and I genuinely had trouble seeing his side of things but eventually we worked that out.

I also encourage you to reach out to a local Planned Parenthood affiliate - we have financial assistance available for lower income patients. Independent providers in your area may be members of the National Abortion Federation, another source of funding for non-PP patients.   Now, the funding from NAF and from PP offices is intended for patients who are uninsured, or whose insurance does not cover abortion. They operate on, essentially, an honor system. So if you don't want to use your parents' insurance, you don't have to, but if it covers it - I recommend calling them to find out - then I would encourage you to use it (if your parents are in the loop and okay with it). That's what insurance is for - big ticket items like this.  Do you have any income? What about the guy in the equation? Have you talked to your family about this at all?

As long as you feel confident when you walk around then you will look good! Be kinder to yourself. Accept that change takes time. As long as you stick to your goal you will get there!  Clothing-wise: Have you tried wearing tights? They are a really great way to have freedom of movement whilst wearing a skirt, because no-one will ever be able to see your panties. Personally, I hold the front of my skirt as i sit, lifting it slightly up my leg so that theres excess, and then pulling that down (perhaps over my knees, depending on length) when i'm actually seated.   Leggings are also a fun way of feeling like you are wearing trousers, but then you can wear a tunic dress, so that you aren't showing your bum and you get the fun of feeling you are wearing a skirt.  Have you tried wearing longer skirts? As you are tall you can wear long skirts without having to wear heels. How about a mid-calf length denim skirt? It's a nice intermediary between more feminine skirts and jeans.   How do you feel about other things that are considered feminine, like heels, make-up etc? Maybe they could make you feel better?  At the end of the day, you choose the side of you that people see. I don't think that there's anything inherently wrong, or unfeminine, about being brash or loud - I know, I know, I read your disclaimer.

askwomenadvice,3bsqsj,Salad_Phallus,3,Wed Jul 1 21:06:58 2015 UTC,"Allow me to regale you with the tale of my personal experience that you may ponder. I had a friend from adolescence, let's call her Melanie. We never had much in common and the only reason I knew her was that my much older sister was friends with her mother and we would be thrown together every summer.   I had no intention of inviting Melanie to my wedding let alone the bachelorette party, but my sister invited her without asking me. I recall the moment that I considered explaining that I was keeping it small, that I hoped she understood but then decided it would be too awkward for everyone involved. So after a slightly strained dinner and nice bar we all ended up at a seedy all male strip club (per Melanie's insistence) which was ridiculous and not even a little sexy and Melanie started drinking like the ship was going down.   She hatched this genius plan to squirt me with whip cream and then pay one of the dancers to lick it off. I managed to wriggle out of ""Chocolate Body's"" grip before he could put his tongue on me and escaped to a dark part of the bar. A bartender asked what he could get me since I was entirely covered in whip cream, I asked for a damp towel and a can of whip cream to exact some revenge. I walked up behind her and put a softball sized squirt of whip cream into her church-of-god perm with claw bangs. While she stood and squealed about her ruined hair, a girl who she had gotten chummy with comes barreling across the bar, grabs the whip cream out of my hand start spraying in the general vicinity of Melanie who ducks. This results in the manager and a bouncer getting hit with whip cream and Melanie, Melanie comes up swinging. She punches me square in the face and her class ring splits the skin above my eye open by about an inch and a half. Blood starts gushing down my face. I am now covered in whip cream and blood and drunk enough that seeing all of the blood made me feel distinctly unwell.  My maid of honor found a sober person to quickly drive us home. Melanie refused to leave the bar. I called my soon to be husband to ask him to please leave his party because I needed stitches. My brother came over before he arrived and determined I could be fixed up easily enough with butterfly closures (he used to play hockey.) While I held an ice pack up to my face and we all discussed how to cover any bruising with makeup Melanie comes bursting through the front door about 4 in the morning. She looks at me and says, ""Who hit you?"" she then proceeds to vomit all over the foyer.   Don't invite people to your important events just because of awkward. Awkward will never make you bleed. Good luck!!"

And if they already recognize that you two have issues then it shouldn't be as much drama to just say ""no, sorry, we just don't get along too well"" and that'll be that."
askwomenadvice,3bsqsj,sdec,2,Thu Jul 2 13:41:12 2015 UTC,"Yikes, awkward.  How big is the bachelorette party going to be, i.e., is it going to be just your close friends?  Would you expect pushback from your friends if you didn't invite her?  How often do you interact with her? Is she likely to be at the wedding, either as an invitee or as a +1 of another guest?  I'm inclined to say, absolutely don't invite her if you don't want her at your party, but I also understand the desire to make sure no one is uncomfortable.  You sound like a thoughtful and decent person, so I would wager your friends value you similarly. I would hope they would place a higher value on your having the party/wedding you want, rather than on appeasing a difficult member of your extended circle.  If anyone gets upset at you for not inviting someone you don't care for, I'd wonder how good a friend that person really is.  Sometimes situations like this make me envious of men, as I think we really put a lot of expectations on women/ourselves to be social mediators and peacemakers, often at our own expense.  Okay, I'm edging closer to just saying, 'no way! Don't invite someone you don't like!'"
askwomenadvice,3bsqsj,ProffieThrowaway,3,Wed Jul 1 22:30:24 2015 UTC,"First, thank you. I appreciate your response, this is exactly what I was looking for.   The bachelorette party is going to be pretty small and intimate, and since I'm not much of a drinker/ partier, will most likely be very laid back with a lot of chatting and enjoying each other's company. If it were going to be a large party, it might not be as big of a deal but this is going to be kind of intimate.   I don't expect there to be any push-back from friends, as most of the women in my group of friends are aware of the nature my relationship with this woman. My maid of honor actually doesn't have a relationship with her either because she lived with G at one point in a multi-roommate situation where G and G's boyfriend owned the house and G was awful to my maid of honor and her guy, and basically forced them out of the house. My main concerns are 1) making her feel left-out (even though I don't want to be around her, I don't want her to be hurt), and 2) our guy friends knowing and thinking I'm being petty or something, although they would never say anything to me about it  I only see her at large group get-togethers like birthdays or holiday celebrations. She and her guy are invited to our wedding.  I think that you might be right. If a couple of the guys think ""god she's so petty"" then they can think that. What other people think of me is none of my business, and I should do what seems right to me."

For the one night stand situation, do they make any suggestion that it will continue? ""I'll call you"" or ""We should do this again"" etc? Are these women that you know or are they literally women you've met and had sex with all in one night? I would say send one message after the fact and then if they don't reply, move on.   Also stop looking for friends in the people you're hooking up with. Rarely do those to circles combine. Unless they're interested in a friends with benefits situation. Or an actual relationship."

Or to be even more productive, start working on your emotional (see a therapist) and physical (hit up the gym) issues so that you can become the type of person that someone will want to be in a romantic relationship with."
askwomenadvice,3bpqgf,MadtownMaven,2,Wed Jul 1 17:43:30 2015 UTC,Why not devote your energy to getting a girlfriend or going on a date or at fixing your physical and emotional issues? That would seem a better use of your time.   You can even work on getting a girlfriend or date before all of your physical and emotional issues are solved.

I guess for this instance, I want to express that I chose wrong.  And really, I stopped chatting with her in the first place in fear that I might accidentally lead her on.

I just want to know, why am I running into these bad women and not good women.   Sooooo, you applied absolutely no criteria and expected that to work?  My point is that you need to put in effort to find someone compatible, not expect them to suddenly appear like in the movies. There may be other things going on - maybe your people-selector is a bit off and you go for women who are actually giving warning signs. But at the heart of it, if you literally chase any woman, of course the vast majority of them are not going to work out.  You also need to differentiate between bad personality traits (lying) and just not being interested in you. Not being interested does not make a woman a bad person."

You're certainly not too picky, I'll give you that.  Has it occurred to you to look for people you actually like talking to and hanging around with? Because if what you want is a real relationship, that's what you spend most of your time doing in them. Maybe instead of casting the widest net possible and reeling in whoever sticks (and if you're talking to 30 women in 60 days that's what you're doing), you should focus on developing some hobbies and interests for a while, and try to meet women who are interested in the same things."

That's weird, dude.  And, her responding with anything but ""yes"", is a no.  She's just not that into you.  And by the sound of it, you come off as a budding ""Nice Guy"".  Go over to /r/NiceGuys and browse, take notes, and don't be like them.  Just because you talked about personal things (friends usually do this too), and she didn't tell you to stop calling her by a weird pet name you decided to use, doesn't mean that she now owes you anything."

With that said, check out things related to the PUA community. It takes a lot of practice and only works on women you probably wouldn't want to have sex with anyways."

And, if I were you, I'd split the talk about how/how much to parent away from the sex talk.  Common for both talks should be that you both are fully clothed and have not just had an argument, when you talk. :)  Anyway, a good way to get a woman to not want sex is for her to be tired and stressed. So, if you do your share of the household duties, and generally you two are a good match who make eachother's lives better, that hurdle will be removed at least.  I hope everything goes really well for the three of you."

I'm not a lawyer but it does sound like she has grounds for a lawsuit here and I would strongly recommend having her at least consult with one.

I know your brother got married this way, which is awesome and romantic, but his situation is definitely the exception rather than the norm.

askwomenadvice,3bjfy5,Turin082,3,Mon Jun 29 18:46:56 2015 UTC,"I mean, you can be straightforward without being unromantic. There's a big difference between ""I really like you and I think we have potential for a real relationship, what do you think?"" and ""I am looking for a girlfriend and consider you a good candidate."" You know? It should be about expressing your feelings and connecting with your partner, not checking a box.  Personally I like the ""dance"" to a certain extent, but at some point you have to say something and be vulnerable.  So like, I would hate it if someone asked to kiss me with absolutely no lead-up - there should be flirting, other kinds of touch, getting into shared physical space, etc. But if you get to that point and then want to ask, go ahead."
askwomenadvice,3bjfy5,carboncle,2,Mon Jun 29 19:51:00 2015 UTC,"Well, different women will react... differently. I think asking to kiss someone is really cute, and would prompt me to kiss them. For some women it would be a total turn off. I prefer people who are open and honest about what they want. I think you should do what's natural for you, because it will probably help you find someone who is similar to you or understands your mentality.

But if you're considering some strangely robotic speech ""I desire to kiss you now. Do you also desire to kiss me?"" It'd be a huge turn-off.  You have to pay attention in the moment.

If they crossed any boundary I would not remain friends with them out of respect for my fianc√©, who always comes first.   In my mind, this girl has crossed many boundaries.  Why is it okay for him to remain friends with someone who is in love with him? Out of respect for you, he needs to put a stop to this, especially because you've told him how it makes you feel (multiple times). You shouldn't have to do anything - he needs to take care of it. And telling you to just ignore it while blowing off your feelings on the matter is not cool."
askwomenadvice,3bfwb8,ruinyourself,7,Sun Jun 28 22:31:26 2015 UTC,"I dealt with something very similar in my most recent relationship.  I think he needs to respect the boundaries of the relationship, and respect YOU. It's about caring about your feelings, and that's that. I think it's less about how she acts or what she does, and more on how he reacts, and how he protects you and your relationship, because there's nothing either of you can really do about her, except for him telling her to get lost."

He needs to something, not you.   If he refuses, then maybe it is time to access the reasons why he is still keeping a woman, who is in love with him and clearly wants him back, around.

Its definitely odd for a late 30's woman to be so...obsessed. I think him keeping her around is enough for her to think there is a chance or at least hope. I don't think being friends is what's keeping this woman attached or longing for that relationship. What is happening that this woman is still mentally tied to him. This poor woman needs to move on but it shouldn't be your job to put an end to this nonsense. Its your bf's. For whatever reason he's stalling.

It's not like you're less worth, on the contrary, it's great to have a woman who is experienced. A woman who knows what she's into and who knows her way around. Sex always gets better with experience.

I suspect you've lost touch with what it's like to look after a toddler 24/7. And how demotivating and deadening it can be to spend all day with a 3 y.o. and not interact with adults. Watching a kid for a few hours does not compare.  If money is the issue, talk with her about what would be ideal for each of you. Basically get on the same page about what you each want. And look at what's practical. Child care is not cheap.  But I suspect the issue is not entirely money."
askwomenadvice,3bfo3j,wobblebase,0,Sun Jun 28 21:46:13 2015 UTC,I've never watched my son for 48 hours. I've worked since he was born and when she goes to visit her parents in another state she takes him while I stay home to work so they have travel money and we don't get behind. So I've never had a full 24 hours just he and I
askwomenadvice,3bfo3j,mykidisonhere,10,Mon Jun 29 03:16:23 2015 UTC,"Instead of just saying that you have never watched your son for  24 hours you made a point of mentioning that you financially support them.  What she is doing is valuable too, even if she doesn't get a paycheck.   It's hard work.  When my kids were little I remember them making messes as I cleaned.  It was miserable keeping up with them.  Everything I did was quickly ruined or a job that was never finished.  There is always more dishes, wash, cleaning and cooking to be done. In face, a lot of those are back to back jobs, only to be repeated day after day, ad infinitum."
askwomenadvice,3bfo3j,localgyro,10,Mon Jun 29 04:24:00 2015 UTC,It sounds like maybe you two need to be talking about money and about whether or not you're getting resentful about being the only one working.  That pile of clothes on the floor does NOT sound like the actual issue here.
askwomenadvice,3bfo3j,localgyro,-3,Sun Jun 28 20:32:55 2015 UTC,"I don't mind being the only one working but I feel the relationship is one-sided since I work and come home and clean. I don't cook cuz I don't know how and she handles most of the laundry but my work clothes haven't been washed in a week and I'm running out of clothes. I know I can do my own laundry, it's just not something I do. It's an unspoken thing in our house. She's never complained about it. I appreciate the criticism tho. That's why I posted here. I want advice on if I should be doing more or if I'm doing something wrong."
askwomenadvice,3bfo3j,localgyro,11,Sun Jun 28 21:27:46 2015 UTC,"So talk to her about it.  That's more productive than griping about a pile of clothes on the floor.  Talk to her about what she does all day, and what it's like having a toddler around the house.  Talk to her about how you can't go to work with dirty clothes.  Talk to her about your joint situation in general -- those things that are ""unspoken things"" are kind of landmines, because you don't actually know if you two agree about it or not.  And then there's a mismatch of what you think, and then everyone feels both betrayed and like an asshole.    Maybe the answer one of you doing the laundry.  Maybe it's getting more work clothes for you so that laundry can be done more rarely.  Maybe it's having a friend look after the baby for a few hours here and there so that she has a little more time available.  We don't know.  And you won't know until you talk it out and think it over."
askwomenadvice,3bfo3j,MostlyALurkerBefore,2,Sun Jun 28 21:32:47 2015 UTC,This is probably the best answer I've gotten all night. I will try talking to her again when I get home it's just that she gets so hostile even when I ask politely. All I did was ask if she could fold the laundry and she snapped. I calmly asked what the difference was between me asking her to do it before leaving for work and her asking me before she goes out and that's what started this whole thing. Now that I've been working for a few hours and I've calmed down some I'll try to mention it hopefully without an arguement and get everything out on the table. We tend to let the little things build up for months when it explodes into a fight and then we talk it out all night and we're good for months before it starts all over again
askwomenadvice,3bfo3j,MostlyALurkerBefore,7,Mon Jun 29 03:22:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah, context is important -- asking her to pick up the laundry when she's just had 8 hours of screaming toddler or something is going to get that sort of response.  It's going to feel like you feel she can't do anything right.  If you want to have this conversation, you need it to feel like a collaboration, rather than ""you're screwing up, and I need you to shape up."""
askwomenadvice,3bfo3j,MostlyALurkerBefore,8,Mon Jun 29 03:51:20 2015 UTC,"Even if things are ""unspoken,"" it doesn't mean they're set in stone.  For instance, it's ""unspoken"" that I do the dishes and my SO takes out the trash and sweeps/mops.  But, if he's had a particularly stressful day or week at work and the trash needs to be taken out, of course I'll take it out (or sweep and mop). Likewise, if I'm stressed out at school or it's finals week or something, he'll happily do the dishes.  Have you asked her how it's going for her? Taking care of a 3-year-old full time is stressful as hell, and it's tiring and exhausting. There's all the food preparation and kitchen cleanup, toys cleanup, making sure the child is safe and not getting into anything s/he shouldn't be, not to mention the basic house necessities that get taken care of as well.  It's an awful lot to do, especially when your supposed partner is spending all of his free time sleeping or playing video games.  Have you thought about a cooking class? There are a lot of websites with easy-to-understand recipes as well.  What do you do on the weekends? Is that more video games and sleep? Or do you try to help your wife by taking your kid to the park or something and giving her some alone time?"
askwomenadvice,3bfo3j,MuppetManiac,1 point,Sun Jun 28 23:00:08 2015 UTC,I ask her every night when I get home how her day was and if there's anything I can do to help out. On the weekends my parents take our son so she has the house to herself while I'm gone.
askwomenadvice,3bfo3j,Svataben,3,Mon Jun 29 00:49:22 2015 UTC,"""while I'm gone""   Do you spend any time with her?"
askwomenadvice,3bfo3j,cherobics,1 point,Mon Jun 29 00:57:21 2015 UTC,Not really. We tend to do our own thing. She hangs out in the bedroom while I'm home playing a game or watching YouTube videos. I mentioned that I feel like we never spend time together but nothing really changed. We try to spend time together but whenever we do she's on her phone looking at Facebook. Any advice what to do? She doesn't sit long enough to watch a movie she gets bored easily.
askwomenadvice,3bfo3j,Svataben,9,Mon Jun 29 03:28:11 2015 UTC,"Okay, this is going to sound harsh, but here's how I understand your situation:  You are the only one working, and she is a SAHM with your child.  When you're not working, you prefer to play video games.  When she doesn't keep the house spotless, you grow resentful because she doesn't have a ""job.""  Yet, you refuse to do any housework because you ""don't know how,"" or because it's unspoken that you shouldn't have to.  On the weekends, when you have a couple days to just spend time with her, you don't and prefer to go elsewhere or play more video games.  You don't understand why she doesn't want to spend time with you.  I agree with others that the laundry is not what is really the problem here. When you say that you have tried to spend time with her, what have you done? If she gets bored watching a movie, maybe you could go out to eat, or even just go for a walk.  Are you guys doing anything that is just the two of you enjoying each other's company?  I don't blame her for not wanting to sit around and watch you play video games; it's not enjoyable for the person not playing.  Sitting together in the same room is not spending time together."

You are seriously undervaluing what your wife does, just because she doesn't get a paycheck. Then you come home and offer her no affection, spend no time together, and are not maintaining your relationship in any way. You need to spend some time with your wife if you want her to still be your wife in five years."
askwomenadvice,3bfo3j,emshedoesit,8,Mon Jun 29 14:24:02 2015 UTC,"Yes, you're the asshole.  I'm sorry, but you asked. Watching a kid full-time is fucking hard, and just because you can handle a few hours, doesn't mean you know what her days are like.  And when exactly do you watch him?

askwomenadvice,3bfo3j,SushiIsLife,3,Mon Jun 29 00:50:15 2015 UTC,"Guess what? Your wife doesn't have that luxury. Ask her when the last time she had a choice was to spend more than an hour on anything that wasn't a chore or related to the kid.... I guarantee you have a lot more downtime during your work days than she does. (kid days are work days. Period.)   EDIT: after reading your other responses, I think you might be being a little willfully oblivious here. Did you actually WANT advice, or just some validation ? You are getting a ton of folks trying to show you a different perspective, and you are really resisiting seeing things from any viewpoint but your own.   Dude, seriously. Instead of sending the kid to your parents one weekend, give her a ""vacation."" send her somewhere, and you stay with the kid alone all weekend. This be like hitting the ""reset""  button for her (getting out the house sometimes makes you realize more keenly how messy it is.) This will also give you a better perspective on what her daily life is like, and you can decide for yourself if you still think your assessment is accurate."

You get to ask her out once. Once. If she says no, you're done. Because if you ask her out again, you're sexually harassing her and can lose your job.  Don't dump your feelings on her. Ask her on a date. Say the word date and suggest a time/activity. ""Do you want to be my date to the company picnic?""  If she says no, don't apologize. Just say something like ""Had to try.""

It can cause jealousies and if one of you becomes the other's boss it's hard to keep objectivity.

But what has helped me personally was focusing on the other people in my life who are still around and still make me feel good, the ones who stuck through good and bad, especially the ones who were his friends too.

We broke up because he got itchy feet, essentially, and we didn't know how to work through it. It was very painful for me, especially as he experienced mental health issues post-breakup and we didn't properly separate (kept sleeping together, arguing etcetera) for 6 months after.  It's three years since and I still think of him occasionally, but I had to make active choices to get rid of him from my life/mind.  1. Throw out your connections with him. You don't need those old letters. You might not be reading them but you still have them... Not necessary. Same with deleting phone numbers. Remove the access.  2. Do something for yourself - for me this involved running and joining a sporting club, essentially expanding my social circle and using running to feel more positive about my body. You need to be your own champion.  3. Go out with your friends! Talk to them, share how you feel, bitch as much as you like. Get it all out and use their outside perspectives to gain a new perspective.  4. If the chance comes up - flirt. You don't necessarily need to have a new relationship straight away, but it's important to come to terms with the concept of other blokes being into you.  5. Let time pass. Time helps enormously.

askwomenadvice,3bgxck,Jackehboy,8,Mon Jun 29 03:09:59 2015 UTC,Oh man there is no way I would ever date my landlord (or family of said landlord). Like I don't care if the dude was Chris Hemsworth levels of hot there is just too much potential for shit to go bad/be horribly fucking awkward. Especially if I just moved there. It means you're like contractually obligated to interact for at least a year(I'm guessing).   It's kind of like how you shouldn't hit on wait staff or retail workers because it's their job to be nice to you and they can't tell you to fuck off even if they wanted to. It's like that but 10x worse because she has to live there. She's not going to be a jerk to the landlords son and you shouldn't take advantage of that.
askwomenadvice,3bgxck,Rowsdowerr,8,Mon Jun 29 03:50:39 2015 UTC,"Or you could leave her alone.  Think about it. You're basically her landlord, and you know her boss. Don't try to date her. You've got power over her, and it's too risky for her. It's putting unfair pressure on her just to ask.  This is going to be her home. Don't make it an awkward place for her.  Adding to that:   Lucky me one of my good friends moms is the principal of the school she's at so I know she's a good girl   Eeeeew! Do you know how gross and old fashioned you sound?  You don't even know her. You don't know if you have anything in common."

You could be waiting your entire life for her to sort her shit out OR you could be with someone who actually gives a crap about you.   You can not keep waiting around for this girl to maybe dump her boyfriend and then maybe want to date you.
askwomenadvice,3bgmlo,Rowsdowerr,1 point,Mon Jun 29 03:57:53 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's that she doesn't give a crap about me, it's just that she gets really insecure and has low self esteem. She had a pretty rough and abusive relationship before the guy she's been seeing, and I bet this guy doesn't ""let"" her talk to other guys. But I am really conflicted about all this. I feel like I can't just try to date someone else because I would only compare them to her, or feel like I'm just filling up time until she comes back. I pretty much can't look at any other women with complete and genuine interest, even though my feelings for her aren't as strong as they were last year.  I mean, I'm kinda just waiting until they break up before I can get some sort of closure by actually talking things out with her. Maybe we wouldn't end up dating, but she basically just disappeared from my life so it's hard to simply put it behind me."

Even when she wasn't with this dude she hooked up with other guys and not you. Again I ask, why are you waiting around for this girl? It is not your job to save her from big bad boyfriend or be waiting for her with open arms IF she ever leaves him.   Move on. Stop wasting time on people who don't have time for you."

He hasn't done it to upset you. Frankly I feel the tattoo isn't the problem at all, it is the fact that you are feeling resentful that he's had the opportunity to travel around.   It's hard feeling like you're being left out, but unfortunately it's a harsh reality of life that life happens whether we're there for it or not.   It seems as though you wanting to have somehow been involved in the decision making process is a way of you feeling like you have some measure of control  over him (not in a creepy way btw), and that you're having the oppo to br involved in his life even though you're not together.

askwomenadvice,3bf4vz,jellie420,3,Sun Jun 28 19:41:18 2015 UTC,"I personally find it somewhat childish and annoying, but that's because I've had several partners constantly nagging and whining and complaining about their size and assuming I'd never be satisfied in our sex life because of it, and that's just not true.   It's annoying when you've told someone a million times how much you love them, everything about them. When you're having great sex and enjoying yourself but they think your faking it or lying because they don't have a pornstar cock. They allow this small part of who they are effect them and their relationships so much to the point of ruin and that's not fair to their partners or to themselves really.   An example; I have small breasts. Yes, I'm a little insecure about it, I wish they were bigger, sometimes it makes me a little jealous when my guy checks out a lady with nice big ones, but in the end, I know he's mine and he loves me for me and it's not something I can change so why get all worked up over nothing? Why ruin my relationship and make my partner feel guilty for something I can't change.   That is my rant, it is over. Now here's my advice, if you really feel the need to ask in a way that isn't accusatory or self pitying. If she says she loves your dick and it makes her cum like crazy, accept that and be happy. Don't let your assumptions about your size kill your sex life and relationships."

It's like this:   Guy is close, and as he notices me, he starts acting differently. If he is simply giving me space, I feel good about that. It's respectful and nice. I assume he's respectful and nice.  If he starts talking to me, he's basically forcing me into contact with him. I start wondering why. Why is this stranger trying to talk with me?   (- If he starts humming or overly jangling his keys or some other clear behaviour based on me being there, I'll wonder what his deal is.)  If you find yourself in a similar situation in future, just hang back, but don't say anything to her.   And, hey, don't feel bad.

askwomenadvice,3bbhzd,el_zilcha,3,Sat Jun 27 18:34:16 2015 UTC,"This is going to sound like strange advice, but if you disagree on music, the best thing you can do is try and find a middle ground. Listen to your music on your own time and then focus on the ""middle ground"" stuff when you spend time together.   The best way I can think of to do is to create a last.fm account (I'd link mine for example but no links, mine's the same username as this acct) and upload your plays and ""scrobble"" everything you listen to. This will make sort of a digital fingerprint of your tastes, give you similar artists to listen to and overall broaden your listening experience. If both of you create an account and use it quite a bit, over time you will see that there is something called a compatibility meter, and the more active you are on your accounts, the more accurate it will be. Basically it will show you the artists you havee in common with each other and how ""compatible"" you are based on those things.   The ""compatible"" artists and similar artists to those are your middle ground. That is what you should focus on expanding and listening to while you are together. BE openminded and honest and try listening to these new albums and bands together.  Let's face it: She's never going to like those particular songs most likely. Music taste is something that changes often but generally not drastically, and if she hates your music enough to find it shameful then she will most likely never grow into it. So instead of trying to force her to listen to it, and instead of her throwing a childish fit over hearing something she dislikes, focus on the POSITIVE middle ground and explore similar artists related to the ones you have in common. It'd be a fun activity to do together, you might find your ""songs"" doing so and maybe even some solid new bands. Good luck and Godspeed! :)   (As a side note, you seem to like a bit of soulful 80s music, perhaps you will like a new experimental genre called Vaporwave. It mixes electronic/pop music along with older songs and is a hit amongst the youth these days. Has the instrumentals of your songs but with minimal vocals. Very good car music, she might like it! Now instead of being embarrassing in her perspective, you are hipster. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ki-fATpXa00)"

Seriously though, if your musical tastes all tend towards a time before you were born you just will get some shit about it from your peers and partners.    My husband and I have an agreements of sorts about the music we play around on another.  He limits the NWA or Eazy-E and I only play the best of The Smiths or Dead Can Dance. If I were to start jamming to Sisters at a party full of his college friends he would most likely be slightly embarrassed but not embarrassed at home or in the car (where he would be more likely to enjoy himself by mocking my choices).

It's not my cup of tea, but I wouldn't be embarrassed. I think she cares a little too much what other people think. If it's only been a month I would really look at what kind of person she is.

If she knows this, and accepts this, and just wants sex, then this is perfectly ok.  Third - you are always lecturing her, telling her you don't like her choices in her personal life that is none of your fucking business and you're surprised when she pushes you away? Really?

I told my boyfriend I wasn't into anal and that was it, he left it and he said that if I ever was curious to talk to him when or if I wanted to. That's how this should go to, she might change her mind later or she might not. You're not gonna be the same person at 20 as you were when you were a teen. But it has to come natural and she has to want to do it and be curious herself. You can of course start with asking ""Would you like it if I licked you?"", and explain that for you, you find her beautiful and think it's completely ok to do. She might say no, but she might in the future be curious. She might be concious of her genitals too(i.e scared she smells/feels she is gross).  But besides just asking if she'd want to receive I'd leave it if she says no. I don't think asking is inappropriate, the only thing that's incorporated is pushing someone."

If you could just give it some more thought, someday it would be really awesome if you could do that for me. But only if you ever decide you're comfortable.""

If she does, then ignore that part.)  Now, does that excuse the behavior? No. What I'd do is maybe speak with her and say something like, ""Hey, I totally get things are new and exciting, I really dig this dude and your relationship is awesome.

I would leave it where it is unless that part of her past bothers you. If it does bother you then I see two options find a way past it or ask her about the shoots in a nice way. For instance ""so you had a photo shoot done how lucky am I to be talking to a model"" keep it light hearted. But like I said if it's not an issue for you I would let it ride."
askwomenadvice,3b5gc1,Svataben,2,Fri Jun 26 06:27:52 2015 UTC,"Mainly pictures and solo videos, now my question is, should I speak to her 1on1 and tell her that I found the pictures/videos and hope that she will get closer to me or just leave it?   Are you seriously asking if you should tell her you watched her porn, and that you really want to fuck her now?"
askwomenadvice,3b5gc1,Svataben,0,Fri Jun 26 13:04:38 2015 UTC,"No, I just want to tell her that I will not be treating her any differently."
askwomenadvice,3b5gc1,mmmmmbb,3,Fri Jun 26 14:15:00 2015 UTC,"should I speak to her 1on1 and tell her that I found the pictures/videos and hope that she will get closer to me    This sentence, what does it mean?"
askwomenadvice,3b5gc1,JennyJenJenJenJen,3,Fri Jun 26 14:37:55 2015 UTC,"Why do you need to tell her that? Just...do it instead. Treat her like a normal person because she is a normal person.   And you don't need to feel guilty for doing a quick Google search - many people do it and as long as you weren't actively trying to dig up dirt on her I don't think it's morally wrong.   But speaking as someone who works in the adult industry, DO NOT BRING IT UP. Let her bring it up if/when she's comfortable enough with you. Mentioning it will not make her feel ""closer to you."" It will probably make her think you're just one more ""fan"" trying to get in her pants or stalk her/blackmail her."
askwomenadvice,3b5gc1,jsage21,1 point,Fri Jun 26 16:27:38 2015 UTC,"Ended up speaking to her and the subject was brought up and I told her, she said its fine and that I shouldn't worry and the money was worth it."
askwomenadvice,3b5e2r,ghost261,6,Fri Jun 26 02:48:13 2015 UTC,"Maybe on purpose, maybe not; but regardless of her intent, she is.  The engagements leave you feeling confused and she doesn't change her situation therefore yes. At the most basic sense. Yes."
askwomenadvice,3b5e2r,wifichick,5,Fri Jun 26 02:52:01 2015 UTC,"I think this sounds like a trainwreck.  No idea if she's telling you the truth or not, but even if she is ... good god, the drama that would be involved.  I'd run away screaming, personally, but ... you've got to make your own choices."
askwomenadvice,3b5e2r,localgyro,3,Fri Jun 26 03:02:45 2015 UTC,"I don't know what you're after here, but do bear in mind that she's showing you how she acts in a long-term, serious relationship. And none of it is good."
askwomenadvice,3b5e2r,carboncle,1 point,Fri Jun 26 04:13:44 2015 UTC,But can you judge someone so quickly? Don't people change?
askwomenadvice,3b5e2r,carboncle,1 point,Fri Jun 26 04:48:18 2015 UTC,"People change, but they have to acknowledge they've done something wrong and take consistent, active steps in order to make it happen. There's nothing to indicate here that she's likely to change."
askwomenadvice,3b5e2r,carboncle,1 point,Fri Jun 26 04:56:43 2015 UTC,In totality....I agree. Tomorrow I'm not accepting anything unless she looks me in the eye. I feel like she is kinda htere but I don't want to be an experiment. I'm looking for love.
askwomenadvice,3b5e2r,carboncle,5,Fri Jun 26 05:14:30 2015 UTC,"If what you want is love, then dating someone who's engaged to someone else is a bad move. This should be pretty obvious if you think about it.   In any case, remember that it's not so much about what she says as what she does. She can want to break up with him and be with you, but that means nothing if she doesn't follow through.  And that's a minimum starting point. Her behavior toward her partner throughout this story is deplorable, and you should keep in mind that this is who she is - this is how she behaves. Toward someone she's agreed to marry."
askwomenadvice,3b5e2r,olov244,1 point,Fri Jun 26 05:19:39 2015 UTC,"Actions speak louder than words. Can't someone change though? I see what you are saying but I'm so oblivious to the red flags. However, I'm slowly seeing them.   I think she doesn't want to hurt my feelings but she doesn't know how to do it. Which makes me feel like she does like me. I don't know. I feel like I'm so fucked.  Why did I do this to myself?"
askwomenadvice,3b4nr1,newbie2016,7,Thu Jun 25 22:58:11 2015 UTC,"She doesn't know you, you're not Facebook friends with her, and you want to message her out of the blue. That reads as totally creepy. I'd ignore and block you."
askwomenadvice,3b4nr1,MuppetManiac,-1,Thu Jun 25 23:05:08 2015 UTC,I have 5 mutual friends with her...don't you think that would ward off some of the creepiness?
askwomenadvice,3b4nr1,MuppetManiac,9,Thu Jun 25 23:13:26 2015 UTC,I's still block you.
askwomenadvice,3b4nr1,MostlyALurkerBefore,8,Thu Jun 25 23:50:46 2015 UTC,"This is creepy. You saw her from afar, you have never spoken to her, and you found out her personal information.  Don't do it. Get to know her when your term starts and you have a natural interaction. But don't obsess.  Mutual friends doesn't really mean anything. Also, she probably wouldn't get the message anyway, since you're not her friend."
askwomenadvice,3b4nr1,MostlyALurkerBefore,0,Thu Jun 25 23:27:41 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't have the time, and emotional energy to begin something new with the term going on. I'm not doing anything now, and have the time and emotional investment to devote to something like this. Any other thoughts other than waiting until the term starts? I'm sure she recognizes my face (I mean we were in the same advanced class for a semester, and when I mention the remark of ""clutching your head"" - its a sentiment anybody who went through the class would laugh at and agree with, so that's not derogatory)."
askwomenadvice,3b4nr1,MostlyALurkerBefore,4,Thu Jun 25 23:45:26 2015 UTC,But it's creepy. She was taking an exam and you were watching her.
askwomenadvice,3b4nr1,MostlyALurkerBefore,-4,Fri Jun 26 00:58:27 2015 UTC,"Wow. The degree of cynicism here is out of the world!!!!!! First of all, I took that exam too and was also clutching my head, so it was meant as a joke she could laugh at. Next, wanting to fuck you?? Really?!! Maybe I could message her, get to know her, take her out on a date afterwards...have you ever thought of that??? I'm sorry you've had such a hard life and every man who has ever met you wanted to f**k you right away. I assure you that men exist who don't think about fucking all day, and want to build a relationship with somebody - trust me its a much better way to live. Wow. I am genuinely stunned."
askwomenadvice,3b4nr1,Money_is_the_Motive,4,Fri Jun 26 01:14:29 2015 UTC,"Okay, what do you like about her that doesn't have to do with physical attraction? What do you know (not assume or imagine) about her as a person that you like?"
askwomenadvice,3b4nr1,MostlyALurkerBefore,-1,Fri Jun 26 02:55:53 2015 UTC,"Maybe that she's intelligent? That she enjoys the same academic disciplines that I do? Has similar interests, career goals???"
askwomenadvice,3b4nr1,jennaiii,3,Fri Jun 26 05:00:43 2015 UTC,So would you send the same message to someone else in your program? A man? A woman you didn't find attractive?
askwomenadvice,3b4nr1,jennaiii,1 point,Fri Jun 26 06:20:32 2015 UTC,"C'mon man I'm a dude and this was weird to read but I don't get it fam, you asked for some advice from the women on this subreddit and when you get it you want to bitch about it? What makes this even worse is that you're only whining because the replies don't support your fantasies of being a creepy introvert and still getting ""lucky"" with women. I mean, you'd have to talk to that girl at one point bro man up, stop being a weirdo and ""just do it!"" Queue in Shia LaBeouf speech"
askwomenadvice,3b4nr1,Svataben,-1,Sat Jul 4 06:48:21 2015 UTC,One more thing - her name wasn't hard to find at all because we get a roster list with everybody in the major I'm in...it's not like I dug through piles of paper to find it.
askwomenadvice,3b4nr1,EarwormsRUs,7,Thu Jun 25 23:49:28 2015 UTC,"Okay, I'll try to explain how I would read your message if it were me:  ""Hi! You don't know me at all, but we were in class together once and I remember starting at you while you were trying to do work, and you were very stressed out. It was at that moment I realized I wanted to fuck you despite knowing literally nothing about you as a person! Unfortunately, I am unwilling to talk to you in person, so instead I searched for your personal Facebook page to try to get you to fuck me. Please tuck me? Signed, A Stranger Who Leered Once"""

Are you pissed because they didn't agree with how brilliant your plan is?  You don't randomly message strangers. She will think wtf is this random weirdo doing messaging me? Then she'll get paranoid about bow you found her name. It is not going to end well. Get a mutual friend to introduce you. Bring up the exam when you're chatting, ""I think I saw you clutching your head in xyz exam. Was that you? It was an absolute nightmare right?!""  Either be polite and accept people's advice, be polite and choose to disagree, or gtfo."
askwomenadvice,3b4nr1,MostlyALurkerBefore,-2,Fri Jun 26 06:48:28 2015 UTC,"Finally a sane person who didnt just say ""I'd block you,"" thanks!! You may have noticed the others were being a little rude."
askwomenadvice,3b4nr1,MostlyALurkerBefore,3,Fri Jun 26 07:18:36 2015 UTC,"Well I think she would block you. What you're planning to do is incredibly creepy.  I don't think they were being rude, I think they were being honest."

Don't worry, this is quite common especially amongst young men.  To improve matters I suggest socialising with a wide variety of people - both genders, all ages etc etc, and take up meditation."

askwomenadvice,3b13bw,stephiej17,5,Thu Jun 25 03:00:03 2015 UTC,"My SIL and I don't get along at all. I used to get a mix of anxiety and dread and panic at the thought of spending any time with DH's family.   She's obnoxious and overbearing and really, really rich. As in, 4 houses never had a mortgage, never had a job, travels all year long rich. She's been rich for so long she doesn't understand how normal people can't just do X. Even if X costs 10 grand.   She is also in charge of all of the family functions for DH's side of the family. Her grown children are the only children who matter. Ours don't matter, and DH's brothers kids definitely don't matter.   DH and I got married, she didn't come because she was heading to New York that week for a girls weekend. DH has an older brother who's SON DIED. SHE DIDN'T GO TO THE GOD DAMN FUNERAL because she was going to Florida that day. Mind you, they have a house in Florida so it's not like they don't already go half a dozen times a year. I could go on and on.   How I get through the times I have to be around her(and this is embarrassing to admit out loud; I'm a grown assed middle aged woman) is that I pretend I am a scientist and I am there to study her alien behaviour. Sometimes while studying 'the subject' I 'introduce different variables' to study her reaction. For example, I will say to her ""Hey, I have that same exact candleholder! Did you buy yours at the Dollar store as well!!??""   Then I sit back and note her reactions. :/   It's really immature but it stops me from internalizing her behaviour. Try it. It might work for you. :)"

It is difficult, but if you want to remain with your SO, you're going to have to learn to deal with it. Minimise any contact, but be civil when you have to. Your SO will respect you for rising above it too."
askwomenadvice,3b13bw,Miss_bone,1 point,Thu Jun 25 06:39:33 2015 UTC,Mostly I am happy she lives across the country. Sometimes my SO addresses her bad behavior. Otherwise I treat her like I would anyone else I had to be nice to.
askwomenadvice,3b13bw,MuppetManiac,1 point,Thu Jun 25 12:44:05 2015 UTC,"Ok so I‚Äôve written out like 3 draft replies to you and felt like I was rambling bc there‚Äôs so much back story and it‚Äôs boring. SO here is what I will say:  Almost 10 years of dealing with my SIL I have learned BE ASSERTIVE. She has a combative nature that has long been outside of my scope when dealing with family, especially my elders.   However, I‚Äôm 30 now and I no longer feel like I‚Äôm a brat kid sister. Now when I think something is bullshit I will calmly and rationally state my feelings about something. OR I will completely uninvolve myself and leave the situation. After so many years of feeling like I was ‚Äòsuffering‚Äô because of her, I remain ‚Äòunaffected‚Äô.   I rarely see them and I hate going over to their house because of her attitude and how she treats me and my family. The hardest is when my parents are in town because I borderline can't control myself when I see her act rudely towards them. I manage this by distracting myself with the kids or not going when they go. I also fixed this by telling my brother to call me to babysit. I can see the kids, they can stop acting like I never want to see them when it's really that I never want to see HER.   This has even helped me with the niece and nephew who are now in the ages where they need a little bit more reprimanding. I stopped being a doormat, basically.  I miss my brother but she has long since taken him away from us. I do what I can for them whenever they need it and my parents have adapted this same style. My brother knows I will always be there no matter what happens. Her behavior can only be tolerated for so long and slowly but surely everyone is kind of coming around to that realization. I have had issues with her for almost 10 years and FINALLY people are seeing these things come to light.   I have communicated things to my brother and I think he has discussed things with her but she's extremely thick headed and always right while everyone else is wrong. She doesn't really give a shit about us and concerns herself with her side of the family and the kids.   Assertiveness, patience and keeping a cool head have helped me get through this.   I literally have been tortured by this situation for a decade... I feel your pain.   edited typos"
askwomenadvice,3b1alj,buriedinthyeyes,12,Thu Jun 25 04:05:40 2015 UTC,"ok noob. i'm going to roast you because you're a noob and you sortof asked for it. but hopefully i will help too?     geek out with her about all kinds of movies in ways that I can't with other girls   i promise that more girls than just this one girl like movies too. really, i promise.     kept her and some other crew members waiting for me for a few minutes.     the horror!     was laughing way too loudly at the film     How. Fucking. DARE. You?!?!?! but seriously: did she (or anyone else) say you were disruptive or are you assuming? laughing loudly is not forbidden unless maybe you are a geisha and at any rate they should be able to laugh as loudly as they want to too, goddamn it!      We chatted until like 2 am last night     she likes you, obviously. nobody talks until 2 am with someone they don't like. whether she likes you as a friend or more...IDK. luckily for you there's this one really simple easy way of finding out:    ASK HER THE FUCK OUT!    it's that easy. if you want bonus points and want to ask her out in a way that minimizes awkwardness, then give her permission to let you down if she's not interested in that way. Women get worried that you're going to go all batshit or clingy on them if they reject you (especially if the you in question is someone they like at least platonically, which is your case) so let her know you're not going to do that (and then DON'T DO IT). it's as easy as saying ""i don't mean to put you on the spot, but i really like you and would like to go out with you sometime. if that's not something you're interested in, that's cool, but i hope you are."" and then if she says no let her know you value her friendship regardless and do your best to keep your shit together and remain her friend. because don't forget -- geeky film girls like to hang out with other geeky film girls, so if you stay friends with her you a) get the pleasure of her company, which you already enjoy and b) might get introduced to more geeky film girls in the future! also you wanna make sure you handle this like an adult because she is not only a classmate but a future coworker and you guys are going to need each other when you both start working regardless. so. yea.      in all seriousness, i know shyness is hard to overcome, but it really IS one of those things that you only get better at with practice. you kinda have to just suck it up and go for it if you wanna have a chance at this (or anything else), otherwise opportunities will just end up passing you by. at least by doing something about this if you fail you fail in a blaze of amazing akward glory.    then again it's just as likely that she might say yes in which case hooray for you, noob! best of luck :)  ask more questions if you need!"

If a girl is accepting dates and making out with you it's pretty much a given that she likes you. If you are leaving after a specified amount of time it's pretty much a given that she's going to guard herself against falling too hard.  Duh.
askwomenadvice,3b10v7,MuppetManiac,1 point,Thu Jun 25 03:32:30 2015 UTC,I was concerned because we haven't done anything aside from making out. Maybe this is just me looking into things but I noticed that she always crossed her arms and typically don't make eye contacts with me when we are out.

I really, genuinely hope you realize how damaging what you did is, because that is the shittiest possible thing I can think of right now.   I'm worried people are going to think I'm this awful jerk for bringing up sex   If they do, then they're going to be appropriately thinking that, because you are a jerk. And whether or not you ""intended to mislead her"", you know she has a history of sexual assault and is vulnerable about sex, you know she's tried to kill herself when you broke up with her, and you know that she's clearly not over the relationship, and you still say shit like that.  Anyways, just let it blow over, and go no contact with the idea of doing it permanently.

We talked briefly. I apologized for what I said re: sex last night and said it was stupid and selfish and it's been bothering me ever since. She said it didn't bother her, said she was flattered but reiterated she just can't do that right now since she personally is a mess at the moment (her words). I told her that my interest in her wasn't just sexual but I thought we shouldn't be in touch for awhile since there is a lot of lingering feelings on both our parts.  She said still she wanted to have a platonic relationship with me because she felt I was the only person who ever cared about her. I said I did but I didn't want her to constantly have hope we would get back together. She said she knew our relationship was over, she just wanted to have an ally on her side. I asked about her new therapist and she said she still feels uneasy about the therapist. I said okay, but maybe we should just text lightly and maybe a call once and awhile at first (no meeting in-person) because obviously we both still have feelings for each other. I said we should rule out sex between us ever again just so things never got confused between us and she agreed."

askwomenadvice,3axo8g,RadBenjamin,27,Wed Jun 24 09:40:31 2015 UTC,"You asked, and she didn't give an answer that would solely stroke your ego. Assuming she didn't bring this up as a complaint, why are you worried? If she's into it, she's into it. Her past partners are irrelevant.   Does she have the biggest boobs of anyone you've been with? The nicest ass? Maybe, but it's likely that someone else had a characteristic that was preferable at a certain time. But I doubt you sit around thinking about how someone from your past had slightly straighter teeth...  And from my experience, no one cares more about or is more obsessed with penis size than straight dudes."
askwomenadvice,3axo8g,MostlyALurkerBefore,3,Wed Jun 24 10:39:23 2015 UTC,"Yep. It sounds to me like penis size isn't as much as a big of a deal to her as to the anon-above. This is not uncommon.  My partner's dated guys who were really big. Like ""you want to put what where?"" big. She likes size. I'm above average but not particularly big. Y'know what? No big deal, we're still having more fun than with most of those folks. Maybe she's had better sex than with me, too. Also not something I'm going to panic about; we're consistently good together. One of her best lovers had a pretty small dick and despite her preference for size, he more than made up for it in sensuality, consideration, skill and enthusiasm. Nice guy too. Point is: Not necessarily a big deal.  I have good female friends who've actually ended potential relationships because of the ""you want to put what where"" problem. Sex is an important part of a relationship to them, and if penetrative sex is a daunting prospect involving litres of lube and an hour-long warm-up then that's not appealing. Similarly, I have a couple of male friends who've been on the receiving end of that - ""oh, hell no!"". One of whom is the aforementioned ex of my partner.  So yeah. Big penises aren't all they're made out to be, people like different things, and it's great that anon's partner is conversing honestly with him about this stuff not just making up ego-padding crap. That's something to value, treasure and build upon."

In this case yes unfortunately you might have been smaller than some of her past lovers but that's not something you have control of and neither does she. It's not like she can lie to you and say something that's simply not true. Fact is you can give her something that women want which is a orgasm. That's really what it comes down to and you passed the test with flying colors. Besides there's more to someone than their penis size."

askwomenadvice,3axo8g,Svataben,1 point,Wed Jun 24 17:19:46 2015 UTC,"I have a different take than the other replies here.  This is immaturity on both your parts.  You learn, when you get a little older and wiser that you do not have to share every single thought in your head.  Every partner has some feature that isn't your favorite.  Do you need to inform them?  No.  Does this mean you need to lie?  No.  In this case she could have handled it better by just focussing on that your junk does it for her, and whatever else she likes about it.  She could have turned the discussion away from inches to a hot sex party.  You need to not ask these questions.  Don't go looking for trouble.  When a SO tells me I'm beautiful I don't demand if I am hotter than Megan Fox.  Why bother?  This type of comment usually gets downvoted to shit, but whatever.  It is a much greater world when you SO tells you he finds you beautiful. Period. Not that X and Y ethnicities are hotter than yours, and that sex is better with hotter women.  For now?  Well, what has been said has been said.  It will probably always bother you a little bit from now on, and that isn't low self-esteem, that is just human nature."

Would it be accurate for me to then say that all men are cheaters?  I'm sorry that you went through what sounds like a very embarrassing experience. The only thing I can recommend is that you get to know lots of actual women, including plenty you have no romantic intentions towards. Family members, friends of friends, girlfriends of friends, just get to know more women so you can start to internalize the idea that they are individuals, and this means some will be nice about things and some will be jerks and lots will be in between depending on the situation."

You're likely hurt from rejection. Okay. You're now basing perception of what seems to be on one incident. Not okay.  How common is it to find gals like you described is a tossup. In my opinion she wasn't malicious. She told you no. She didn't publicly or non-publicly mock you, humiliate you, insult you, or ridicule you to you face before, after, or during asking her out.

askwomenadvice,3atzjr,MuppetManiac,8,Wed Jun 24 06:27:06 2015 UTC,"While you dating is not an impossibility, I will agree it will be harder. If you can get and maintain an erection, you'll be fine in the bedroom department. Girl on top is one of the positions I recommend to women who have trouble orgasming. And plenty of women don't want kids.  Two approaches to dating that might work. Most women are going to see the wheelchair and nope out. So you either need to find the women who don't care, or help someone see past the chair. The best way to do the first approach is with online dating. A brief Google search found 5 different dating services for disabled people. The second approach is a bit harder. You'd have to get to know someone as friends first, so they see your good qualities and overlook your challenges. Which could lead to a lot of heart ache if you get rejected. Unfortunately, you'll have to prepare yourself for a lot of rejection that isn't your fault. Try not to take it personally.  If it helps, my best friend married someone who has a similar circumstance."

So you should certainly be able to find dates at the very least.   I don't have a lot of advice on how to go about this since I, myself, am not disabled. But I just wanted to reassure you that there are probably many women out there who would be willing to give you a chance and many who would ask for a second date.

Don't stick around if it's not right; it ends up hurting you both. Dust yourself off, learn from the failure and open your heart right back up! You only get one life; you will be 35 before you know it. Then 45. Then 55. Once you know what you need from a partner it will be that much easier to spot the Right guy. Try to look at heartbreak as a positive thing as in, you loved and you learned. 3-4 months is NOT too quick to fall in love. You're typically spending all of your time  together in that honeymoon phase and divulging all of yourself, being vulnerable and discovering one another. It's SO easy to fall in love.

askwomenadvice,3aunjw,JohannesH,3,Wed Jun 24 01:25:06 2015 UTC,"Thanks! It's beautiful and awesomely amazing. :)  A little more than a year ago I was overweight, lonely and living far away from whatever few friends I had. I was depressed, suicidal even, and I hadn't dated for more than 15 years (heh, could've used your advice a few years ago :P ). I thought my life was gonna be like that forever, hence the suicidal thoughts. And then last spring, I finally had a total breakdown at work one day.  Then I turned around, said 'fuck that', and started fighting my way out of that shithole.  Now I'm losing weight and training for a half-marathon. I have moved closer to my friends (the best friends you could wish for), and have a calendar stuffed with activities with them. And then, like the sweetest birthday gift from the universe, I meet this intelligent, attractive and wonderful woman, who wants to spend her spare time with me and be intimate with me. Then last night while we were out celebrating my birthday, sitting on a bench by a lake, looking at the lights in the water, she says; ""This is one of the best moments of my life"". :') Baffled, blown away and with tears welling up in my eyes I hugged her, dug deep in my poetic repertoire and said; ""me too"". :P I probably should have kept quiet, but at least I meant it. :)  I intend on making this gift count, enjoy every minute of it, and make it last as long as possible.  Sorry for unloading my nauseating happiness on you."
askwomenadvice,3aunjw,Nicoleinco,3,Wed Jun 24 02:29:05 2015 UTC,"Happy late Birthday and good luck with the marathon! That perfect moment that you had last night, you'll always remember. Next time she pisses you off, try and remember those good moments to help aid in the forgiveness process. If there ever comes a point when the bad outweighs the good, plan a quick exit. But until then, love her with all your heart. One day, you won't be able to feel anything, good or bad. You'll be dead. So try to enjoy all of these lovely thugs called feelings while you still have them!"
askwomenadvice,3aunjw,JohannesH,2,Wed Jun 24 03:23:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'll always be able to look back on that tiny magical moment and say; ""Oh well Johannes, you did at least one thing right in your life"". And just hope for more moments like that to come.  As you said, staying in love is the hard part. And I know for a fact that things in her past will make our relationship very difficult at times... And I'm sure she'll be put through her share of tests dealing with my shit as well. No matter what, I'll work as hard as I can to keep our relationship loving and good, try and learn along the way, and hope for the best. Never tell me the odds. ;)"

But, here's my caution. If you're getting your heart broken because the guys aren't treating you well and you love them so much you're putting up with it, learn your worth. It's more than that. I've put myself through too much damage by loving men who don't treat me well."
askwomenadvice,3aunjw,Incognito167,1 point,Tue Jun 23 22:54:36 2015 UTC,"Not really sure what you mean by dating too fast (3-4 mth mark on average) means but to me this all comes down to taking time to get to know the person. I've been told by girls before that they ""want to take it slowly"" but i don't think we agree what that means. In my head that means see each other regularly but do stuff that's appropriate for the stage of your relationship. To some of the girls i've dated it's meant ""let's leave weeks between dates.""  Dating to me has always felt like it has stages. Meeting, acquaintance, getting to know each other, developing, etc i've just made them up now. Each couple will take a different amount of time at each stage. Basically take as long as you need in each stage to feel comfortable before you move on.  Also depends on why you're heart is getting broken. Did they actually treat you badly? In which case that's tricky to prevent unless there were warning signs. Or do you just fall in love at the drop of a hat, and when a genuinely nice guy just doesn't reciprocate do you feel hurt? I suffer a bit with the last one so i'm not judging by any means."

At 17 people are still working out how to deal with this kind of thing, read signals, understand how to approach rejection, deal with crushes, ect. I'm sure you won't end up jaded, so don't worry.   Being direct if you want to ask someone out is great, so don't be put off. But do (if you're not already) try to read a situation; for example if someone just wants to be friends, or may not be ready to date. I know that seems impossible, but as from what little you said I can't see how you're doing much wrong, it's all I can add really. Chin up, you've got your whole life ahead :-)"

askwomenadvice,3aw8a1,suicidewidow,2,Wed Jun 24 00:21:55 2015 UTC,"My god, I'm so, so sorry for what you've been through. I can't imagine how hard it's been. Hats off to your for holding down such a demanding (obviously rewarding) career. I've never been through anything remotely similar but a friend of mine lost his dad, really unexpectedly at a relatively young age (dad was 57 & they were together at the time, so he witnessed it) and it totally broke him. It took him a long time to get over it, but when he got back to work and kept active (which you're already doing) was when we saw a marked improvement in him. I think once things start replaying over in your mind, it almost becomes habit and the more you don't want it to happen, the more it does and seems to become more powerful.  I'm no therapist and what yours told you seems pretty feasable, but did she discuss any techniques with you of changing your line of thought whenever you get the memories? I know it may sound sort of non-conducive to healing, but everyone is different and if it's something you're not ready to deal with, that's ok.   Edit: spelling (bloody predictive text!)"
askwomenadvice,3aw8a1,ITCrownJen,1 point,Wed Jun 24 01:31:45 2015 UTC,"I'm very sorry for your loss.   These things can't really be pushed aside. You have been actively delaying that process, and intend to try to delay it forever. Think of it like a leak. You've got a leak in your roof. You put a pot down to catch the water. You have to constantly tend to that pot, always emptying it. But you tell yourself you just don't have time to fix the leak. Maybe it's not doing any damage. But you're constantly expending a low level of energy to maintain it. Whereas if you would take the time to fix the leak, you wouldn't have to deal with it again.   You haven't dealt with all your grief over your husband's death. The ""I don't have time for this"" mentality has been holding out for a while, but it won't last forever. It's going to take more and more energy to deal with that leak. What happens when you are in the middle of a huge case and you break down? You need to deal with this. Talk to your counselor. Perhaps go see a grief specialist."

It's awful to imagine the ones we love being treated badly, but that was before she met you and she/you can't change it now.  If anything, it'll make her more appreciative of what you have, so don't let it ruin or put a damper on a great relationship.  Everytime it pops into your head, just think of how she's happy now with you, and the stuff you've done where it's been great. We've all had shit boyfriends; ultimately, it just makes it easier to spot the good ones :-)"

You're very welcome & I'm sure you'd have received loads of good advice here anyway, it seems that way to me looking at previous posts and subsequent comments.   I don't really have anything else to add apart from just saying that you're obviously in a great relationship, both really happy and what's ahead in your future is what really matters. It's not affecting your relationship and nor should it, so don't let some shithead's past actions into your head to the point where it's winding you up. Like I said, just pick a nice memory of you guys together everytime, and push the negativity out of your mind. You don't need it.   She's with you now, you're both young, she's happy and you know you're not that guy. Sounds like you've got a lot to feel positive about, so just keep looking on the bright side and enjoy :-)"
askwomenadvice,3aucl1,harrychronicjr89,10,Tue Jun 23 16:05:28 2015 UTC,Try giving out your number instead of asking for hers. That may put her at ease. Otherwise you just have to understand that most women are afraid of telling men no upfront. I know enough women who have been hurt by men who were/felt rejected that I'm not going to straight up tell a guy no. It's not worth the risk.
askwomenadvice,3aucl1,WooglyOogly,2,Tue Jun 23 16:14:46 2015 UTC,"thanks for your reply! I've actually considered giving out my number since the girls who are interested would reach out but I know a lot of women don't really want to make the first move, or they find it to be more of a turn on if the guy takes the initiative. Guess that's my only hesitation. or prank calls haha"
askwomenadvice,3aucl1,WooglyOogly,5,Tue Jun 23 16:21:36 2015 UTC,"Personally I'm really apprehensive about giving out my number if I don't know the person well or through friends, but if somebody gives me their number I'm much more comfortable."
askwomenadvice,3aucl1,kanikkers,6,Tue Jun 23 16:24:03 2015 UTC,"Giving out your number is still technically the first move, or it should feel like it. You're indicating that you're interested in talking, but not making her uncomfortable. You're directly putting the ball in her court for the second move."
askwomenadvice,3aucl1,carboncle,5,Tue Jun 23 16:58:23 2015 UTC,"One thing to keep in mind, in addition to the other advice, is that your rejection rate is just going to be much higher with meeting randoms vs people who are already socially connected to you in some way. It's just the nature of the beast.   For example, when I was single I noticed that random guys who asked for my number only contacted me afterward, like, 20% of the time. It likely has little to do with you; it's just that most people are less likely to put in the effort over someone they've only met once and are unlikely to run into again. It's more work to foster a connection with that person. And sometimes the initial connection was really more about being on a social ""high"" from the situation, and after that fades so does your interest. Or the person in question just wanted to see if they could get a number, or was casting a wide net and found someone else they're more interested in, or any number of things.  That's not to say it's impossible or that you shouldn't do it, by any means. Successful relationships and friendships do come from randomly meeting each other. It's just that you have to have realistic expectations."
askwomenadvice,3aucl1,MadtownMaven,1 point,Tue Jun 23 17:56:32 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your advice! I do agree, it's a lot easier when you share a mutual connection (friend, coworker, etc.), especially because there is a comfort factor, even on my end because I'm pretty shy. I'm more inclined to approach girls I don't know when I'm out because most of my friends are in relationships and don't have single friends themselves; I also don't want to be the guy who's always asking ""hey do you know anyone?"""
askwomenadvice,3aucl1,MadtownMaven,5,Tue Jun 23 20:01:17 2015 UTC,"Along with what others have mentioned (ie being nervous to give a direct no), it could also depend on the quality of text that you send. The example you gave doesn't give an opening for a conversation. Try asking a question when sending that first text as it can help lead more into a conversation.

If I was your friend and you asked me advice about this, I'd highly recommend not getting involved with this individual (even in a non romantic context since feelings can still develop).  I think it'd just end in heartache, confusion, and maybe even resentment."

Sometimes it's just a personality thing, though it sounds like you're doing something in particular, not that you just have incompatible personalities.  Ask your friends, because they're probably hearing about it."
askwomenadvice,3atcz6,BunnyBeeQueen,1 point,Tue Jun 23 12:15:29 2015 UTC,"Possibly is just a personality thing, but it doesn't seem to put off my female friends so maybe it's joined with the situation and perspective?"
askwomenadvice,3atcz6,BunnyBeeQueen,2,Wed Jun 24 10:53:31 2015 UTC,"Humm I have been the girlfriend in this kind of situation. So none of the girlfriends of this group of friends liked this particular friend, we didn't like him because this behaviors:  a) He would encourage and pressure the guys to do stupid and often dangerous things.  b) He would often comment on the group past girlfriends or actual ones in a nasty way.  c) He used to date really young girls (18-21 when the group was 31-38)   d) He would mock the guys if any of them where planning to move with their girlfriend marry (again all the guys were over 34)   So in general he was often interfering and being nasty, of course none of the women in the group would be rude to him but yeah it came a couple of times to pick between girlfriend or friend with mixed results.  So I will check what attitudes do you have that are making it hard for the girlfriends to be trusting of you, and since not all the girlfriends come and go at the same time of course there's always one that has a bad word about you and they have ammunition.   Because any new girlfriend of your friends must hear the story of the time you where so intrusive in the relationship that X and Y broke-up because of you.  So maybe try to talk to the girlfriend that has more seniority and try to get her to help you out of whatever you are doing wrong?"
askwomenadvice,3atcz6,yaychristy,1 point,Tue Jun 23 23:01:38 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the advice. We don't tend to hang out together as a group and as far as I'm aware the other guys girlfriend's don't really know each other.  Out of the options you listed I could only imagine the encouragement being a problem. I never make any of them do anything they don't want to do, but I'm certainly thick as thieves with them so maybe they just see as pressuring them. We're all between 20-23 so the marrying part hasn't came into play yet haha, but I'll make sure to avoid mocking, not that I would anyway"

askwomenadvice,3aq5gh,throwmedownthestares,3,Mon Jun 22 16:34:02 2015 UTC,"Do you know much about her past dating history? Maybe talking about her past will help, especially if it uncovers that a guy has been unfaithful previously. My SO and I had conversations pretty early on and both realized we'd never cheated but have been cheated on, so I felt pretty comfortable trusting him after that. I'd recommend having a conversation about it, but in a light way, maybe over drinks at a bar one day, not in a ""Sit down, I'd like to talk about this"" way. Definitely asking her if she wants to talk about it will help you, and her, see things more clearly.  Also, I assume the answer is no, but have you cheated in past relationships that she might know about? Again, if she knows about it, that might trigger insecurities.  Either way, as a helpful recommendation on how to respond, if it were me I'd want to hear positive affirmations when I brought up any comments about infidelity. Something along the lines of ""You don't really think I'd do that, do you? I'd never want to."" Or ""You've mentioned this before, but trust me, it'd never happen."" Maybe you do say those things, and if so, awesome job, keep it up! It will probably take time for her to trust you, and maybe you're just too good to be true in her eyes :)"

One of the worst parts is that the girl that he was so concerned about me lying to about me and him sleeping together, forgave him instantly and they are now dating. I told her the morning after, as a warning to get away from him, etc. And the first words out of her mouth was that she was going to talk to him and that she appreciates me telling her but that this isnt going to change anything between her and him and that he respects her a lot more than he respects me.

I thought the university would be enough (for my own closure), but that was when I thought he ""might've"" sexually assaulted me, it floored me when everyone and their mothers on reddit said that no, this is considered rape and he is a rapist. It's very overwhelming. I don't know what I'm going to do."

askwomenadvice,3aq0yn,thirdaccountquestion,6,Mon Jun 22 16:00:32 2015 UTC,"So, and I'm not trying to be mean here, this is called ""dating."" It's perfectly normal. This is how relationships work. It doesn't mean that you are a bad person or that they are blind to your faults; it's just that over time the girls worked out that this wasn't a relationship that they wanted to continue long-term. The vast majority of relationships turn out this way; otherwise everyone would be getting married to their high school sweetheart. You have to date around to find the type of person you'd like to be with long-term. Dating in your early '20s is essentially a vetting process for who you want to spend your life with (if you're leaning toward marriage). If someone doesn't meet the needs you have for a long-term partner, it's okay to look for someone else. Doesn't mean either of you failed.  I wouldn't point out your flaws in a relationship. What you see as a flaw someone else might see as cute or endearing. It's also very much a turn-off (at least, for me) when a guy starts pointing out his flaws up front. We know that everyone has them; when someone points theirs out deliberately it usually comes off as insecure. You don't have to apologize for being you.  If one of your flaws causes a problem in a relationship, just own up to it. ""I know I can be abrasive and I'm sorry. It's something I'm working on because I don't want to hurt you by being curt."" Something like that."
askwomenadvice,3aq0yn,writergal1421,1 point,Mon Jun 22 19:24:35 2015 UTC,"Thank you for you comment. Okay, so you recommend not pointing out flaws early as it is a turn-off for you that makes the person come off as insecure. I am quite comfortable with who I am, and I do not see those aspects of myself as negative, just sums of a whole. Do you think if I present myself like that it would still come off as insecure?  Furthermore, should I even have to do that? Should I care? I want to be proactive if it is more useful, but I can also let it flow organically like I have in the past. I have no problem letting things flow and dealing with issues as they come up. I just have this sense of dating fatigue that arises if I am not being properly efficient with handling myself. Another flaw or whatever right there. I tend to try and make intrinsically imperfect events more organized. Which is why I ask. I want to know if figuring out a better system is me imposing that desire for organization on an essentially unorganized task or if I really can do better."
askwomenadvice,3aq0yn,writergal1421,3,Mon Jun 22 21:06:02 2015 UTC,"I think you're overthinking it. Dating can be chaotic. There's nothing wrong with trying to get some semblance of control over something that is chaotic, but very often people don't like to be fit into other's schedules or checkmarks.  My personal recommendation, which you can take or leave depending on what works best for you, is to let things be organic. It sounds like you've already had three relationships of at least a year. That's a pretty good track record as far as these things go. Your flaws will come up because such is the nature of personality, and that's just all part of getting to know a person. If you bring them up at the outset, you run the risk of prejudicing others or even giving them a false sense of who you are - like I mentioned, some things you think are flaws other people may find endearing.   If they do come up and cause problems, just let the other person know you're sorry, you know about it, and it's something you're working on so that particular issue doesn't happen again."
askwomenadvice,3aq0yn,WooglyOogly,3,Mon Jun 22 21:13:54 2015 UTC,Three ended relationships isn't bad. It takes time to really get to know someone and whether or not you'll work well together. You can't expect to just get it right.  I would work on the sadism thing though.
askwomenadvice,3aq0yn,wobblebase,2,Mon Jun 22 16:58:50 2015 UTC,This sounds pretty normal. Living with or experiencing someone's bad traits is entirely different from a verbal warning about them. Most relationships go from a sort of honeymoon period to more seriously getting to know each other.

So I went into my next relationship determined not to get serious at all. But when I met my now-husband, he's just such a good guy that it was impossible not to trust him and impossible not to fall in love with him. He pretty much just had to be patient enough to wait for me to realize that his intentions were actually honorable, and not just a way to set me up for a long painful fall.

We had some issues when we first started as a couple of trying to figure each other out but with great communication, we got through it and figured it out. I am very open with my SO and he is with me and that is what builds trust in my opinion. He says that the only thing that will ever tear us apart is if we stop communicating and trusting each other because that is not a relationship. And he's right.   Are you going through trust issues with your SO due to being burned in your past? If you are, I'm sorry."

She's admitted she's not the most assertive person and says that her naturally giving nature means she finds it hard to say no people (friends and family included). I don't think she's been seriously burned in the past but i think that aspect of her has been taken advantage of and she was in a bit of a one-sided relationship.  So she's said she wants to take things slowly so she doesn't rush in and can get to grips with how she feels about things. It's slightly frustrating for me in the meantime as i know i'll treat her well and it feels a little like i'm being kept at bay when really i want to spend more time getting to know her, but i'm giving her time and space so hopefully that shows her i'm respecting her wishes. I'm also quite a clear and direct communicator so i'm hoping that helps too. Can't really do more than that.  I do hate it when some men fuck it up for the rest of us!"

You are a good man and it is plain to see that with your concern for building trust and making your hopefully new SO feel comfortable. I too, was in a one-sided relationship recently (not the entire time but a good majority of it, more than I'd like to admit) and I tend to have trouble telling people no as well, so I somewhat know where she is coming from. I think you are doing a wonderful job at trying to show her you care.   Some men just don't get it, how to be kind, but you are not one of them. Kudos to you! Good luck!"

I say time and building a strong friendship as a foundation would be a good way to lead into a really trusting relationship.

They'd never done this; he just figured out it never worked when I thought it was just him being controlling). We ended up having a row about this over the phone & was meant to get the train up to see him that weekend. I decided to end it over the phone, which I know isn't very respectful, but I knew he'd be manipulative face-to-face and I didn't want some drawn out horrible situation for any of us (he wanted to drive down that night to see me).

You don't want to break up by phone/skype if you can help it. In person is best but yes driving 3hrs for each of you isn't ideal. Call him and say that you need to talk about what was said last time. Say that you feel it's best to discuss it in person. This is a decent warning shot so that it won't come out of the blue when you say you want to end it. He'll then either say ""just tell me now"" or you can agree to meet halfway, or if he offers to see you, take it.

Being friendzoned is bullshit and is a stupid term coined by those who are mad that they cannot demand sex from their friends.   Anyway, why I say you should be clear with you intentions is because in the past when I have had guys befriend me to later find out they were only interested in my friendship for sex it crushed me! I genuinely thought of them as friends and to find out I was just a body to them made me so sad. I'm not saying this is how you feel about this girl, but she might possibly take it that way if you aren't up front.   So my advice is to be casual. Take her out to eat or for drinks or whatever. Then say something that makes your intentions clear. If you are up front early on and then if it doesn't work out you two can likely just forget about the whole thing and remain friends.

If the cards are stacked way against you, there's a higher chance that you may not get what you want. Everyone has to deal with this fact to some degree or another. Almost everybody wants aspects of life to be different. Some people, rightly so, find their circumstances particularly unfair. Living the happiest possible life isn't possible if we can't accept that life may not change in the way we want. I am not saying you are being unrealistic or can't accept life or something, I am just giving voice to what I feel about life in general and where I think people, myself included, can cause excessive suffering for themselves.

OKC is a bit odd, and plenty of fish seems slightly less educated but still fun. I don't know if there are any REAL differences to the them though. I think if you put up a profile, and feel out the responses you can have fun and meet people. Straight up tell them your diet needs too.  The strangest thing I hear is how guys/men write really mean and rude messages to girls who reject or are not interested. WTF is that about?   Be strong in those situations."

If you think people are not going to be initially physically attracted to you, then meet people and forge emotional connections first. Some of those relationships may develop into romantic ones! Do this by joining organizations, volunteering, getting involved in new online communities. Of course, I am seriously and sincerely obliged to say: the people you should want to be around (romantically or platonically) aren't going to judge you by how attractive they find you."
askwomenadvice,3ak09e,SalamandrAttackForce,1 point,Sun Jun 21 02:18:03 2015 UTC,"Stay away from dating sites. All the superficial choice makes people picky and everyone wants their idealized version. If someone doesn't have the perfect specs, they can click the next one. You'd be asking a stranger to accept your disabilities right off the bat- and why should they if they don't know you? Your best bet is to meet people in real life. Someone who already likes your personality should be okay with your disabilities. As they get to know you, they'll understand your disabilities and how to plan around them to the point where it's not terribly inconvenient. Find some social hobbies you are able to do to meet people. Consider taking up hobbies you have little interest in just to try it, you never know what you'll actually have fun doing until you try."

She might have just found herself on a different page from you. It doesn't mean she doesn't care about you or that you even did anything wrong. It's just not the right relationship for her anymore.  You probably can't fix it, and any attempts to do so will likely just push her away even more.  My advice is to just let the relationship end, give her a little bit of space, and be as civil and respectful as possible. It's very likely that a little way down the line you can be friends again and have a perfectly normal friendship."

Go grocery shopping with your parents, have a friend pick you up and grab coffee. Depression is a motherfucker in that it warps your sense of how others see you.

See a therapist, talk about your trauma, ask them for their advice. It's okay to leave the house, and it's also okay to be slow about jumping back into life.    You can do this. I know you can. Take deep breaths and stay in touch with your family and your friends. Talk about how you feel with someone you trust, if you can.   Edited to add: you might check out /r/traumatoolbox .

askwomenadvice,3akwlx,wobblebase,2,Sun Jun 21 13:06:11 2015 UTC,"I'm going to second what you wrote right here - the stress of having to keep such a large part of your life hidden is immense. And it sucks from your point of view, but wise advice I was given (and would give to others) is that a relationship you have to keep hidden is not a relationship worth having.   All the love in the world cannot save you the emotional pain of basically having to lead a double life. After spending so long lying to those around you, you can't escape that nagging thought of ""I'm turning into a liar. By continuing to lead this double life, lying is becoming a part of who I am. Is this relationship (or any relationship) worth that?"" So she took the step she thought was best - giving up the relationship so her lie could become the truth, instead of outing it as a lie to her family.   I speak from unfortunate personal experience. I hope it can help you have some closure on your end to understand what was most likely going through her head."

You can cut your hair if you think it's causing an issue, you can go to the gym if you want to be more muscular. You can explore new hobbies. There are plenty of women interested in golf and heavy metal. History is more an interest than a hobby. Writing music is kind of a solo activity in my experience and I've no idea what urbex is, but I promise you there are no hobbies that are entirely gender specific.   My advice is to explore a hobby where groups of people meet to do said hobby. My favorites are swing dancing and bowling league. But there's got to be some kind of golf meetup somewhere."

Also you might have unrealistic expectations, because of course there are women in metal concerts and in golf courses right? but probably you are not their type, As Muppet said there's a lot to be made for owns appearance.  MOST women put effort in their looks and I will bet my right hand that you like the ones that do right? So put some effort and baggy clothes aren't attractive for most women.   Again put some effort"
askwomenadvice,3aix0l,BunnyBeeQueen,6,Sun Jun 21 04:31:11 2015 UTC,"First, most guys who describe themselves as not conventionally attractive can improve their appearance a ton by getting a good haircut and wearing nice clothes. A lot of men don't seem to realize importance of style and fit.  Second, good conversation isn't so much about talking about your hobbies, it's about chatting in general. You kind of just have to be flexible and go with it. Ask lots of questions, tell a funny and relevant anecdote or two, mention a cool article you read, etc. And be confident!"

I have opinions on outfits I see, but I'm not the best person to make recommendations. Although I can say that an ill-fitting polo shirt probably isn't doing you an favors.   /r/malefashionadvice might be worth checking out. They get teased about their 'uniform' but their beginners guides are probably a decent starting point. I think the most important thing is getting clothes that actually fit. So many guys wear stuff that's overly baggy and generally unflattering, which is totally fine if that's what makes them happy, but if you are specifically looking to dress in a way that makes yourself more attractive to women, it might be worth stepping up your game."
askwomenadvice,3aix0l,hoodlummer,3,Sun Jun 21 01:49:34 2015 UTC,"Well, you're young.   First off, having the same hobbies and interests are not the end-all and be-all of relationships. Its a great way to meet people, sure, but I would say having values, life goals and ambitions are the most important things, which is something you probably don't know yet, but should be figuring it out.  I know this is an internet forum, and you wrote your problem in six sentences, but it sounds like you're defining your entire self by your hobbies, which is something you should stop doing. That way, when girls are not interested in your hobbies, you don't take it so personally.  You should try to replace your definition with your ambitions, life goals, relationships with people that matter. Also, you make it kinda seem like you expect to prattle on and on about your hobbies to some girl who should be really interested. That's not really how relationships work. Are you giving her a chance to talk and explain her interests? You should be trying to explore new things together.   You shouldn't discount yourself because you don't feel attractive and you're into cool ""boy"" things. People grow into and out of hobbies all the time. I started gaming at 25. I was really into ska and alternative music when I was younger, and now I hardly listen to music. I was ""into"" science and then I majored it and now I do it, but I couldn't give a rats ass if my SO is into it. Keep your eyes out for new things that might interest you.   Also, I know multiple girls into golf, heavy metal and history.. I'm not sure where you're looking? But again, I'm 30, there might be a dearth of 18 y.o girls into that stuff."

Honestly, I don't think there's anything wrong with primarily hanging out with girls. If your interests are predominantly feminine, that's just what's naturally going to happen. Conversely, if you have a lot of stereotypically masculine interests, then you'll probably end up hanging out with guys more."

I have noticed that as I get older, my friend group tends to start being primarily female. For whatever reason, guys seem to disappear once they get into a relationship and especially when they start getting serious.

But when I recently got my first job last november, I ended up developing really fun friendships with my guy coworkers and it's strictly platonic (is that the right word?). Basically I see them as friend instead of a love interests, even though some of them are cute. This took me a while cause in middle school I had guy friends but then beginning of high school it stopped, then after high school it was easier to talk with boys.   When I hang with them, the conversations can be really diverse. Usually we talk about work then it wanders into school talk or even relationship or personal stuff. My best friends are 3 girls and 1 guy. I feel I can connect with girls better BUT I don't have similiar interests as my girlfriends, so that's what my guyfriends are for sometimes. We talk about games, movies anything really. I feel my convos with dudes are more relaxed and can sometimes be really open. This is probably because some of my girlfriends are pretty conservative, so guys are who I rely on to talk about personal stuff that I want a guy's POV, or in my guyfriends' cases, my POV.

Wait until we have heads-up displays in our own eyes. That should pave the way to making such dossiers possible.   You can't win if you don't play.   A heads-up display that gives dossiers about people will be to dating, as GPSes have been to driving. While a GPS prevents us from taking the wrong turn down the wrong road, the heads-up display I'm thinking of will prevent us from taking the wrong approach to the wrong person.

askwomenadvice,3ahs00,Svataben,5,Mon Jun 29 17:27:26 2015 UTC,"Ok, so I hope you understand how it can be kinda offensive that you see women as a monolith. We are different people, we want different things. Probably part of your lack of success stems from thinking we're all the same."
askwomenadvice,3ahs00,Svataben,5,Sat Jun 20 17:21:14 2015 UTC,NOTHING!  There is no such thing in the universe. Please also realize that I might reject someone based on something going on with me.
askwomenadvice,3ahs00,Svataben,-1,Sat Jun 20 12:41:40 2015 UTC,"There is no such thing in the universe.   I guess when I thought this over, a ""quintessentially unrejectable man"" would have to be able to please everybody, therefore he doesn't exist.   Please also realize that I might reject someone based on something going on with me.   So an example would be a bad life-event (the passing of an old but close relative) and that's one reason why a ""quintessentially unrejectable man"" would have to read minds (as you likely wouldn't volunteer this kind of information as a reason why you'd reject him.)  Then somehow know, after knowing how to read minds, how to smooth over anyone's emotions during a tough time, in an endearing-enough way."
askwomenadvice,3ahs00,Svataben,6,Sat Jun 20 15:08:24 2015 UTC,"No. Ffs..  There are things that some dude (or anyone) cannot smooth over.  Accept that there are cases where no man on earth would have a chance, and it has nothing to do with men."

Please link a good example or two. Thanks.   Accept that there are cases where no man on earth would have a chance, and it has nothing to do with men.   I'll try my best. It helps to learn how to be comfortable with this revelation, however."
askwomenadvice,3ahs00,MuppetManiac,4,Sat Jun 20 21:03:24 2015 UTC,"The abbreviation is TIL, and you are reaching new levels of ignorance.  Imagine a person with cancer. Now smooth it over.   Seriously, you do to need to worry about being perfect, just try not to be this obtuse."
askwomenadvice,3ahs00,MuppetManiac,-2,Sun Jun 21 00:31:42 2015 UTC,"Imagine a person with cancer. Now smooth it over.   If I found out someone had cancer, I'd mention how I read on the news that Hemp Oil is the new miracle cure for even some pretty hopeless cancer cases these days. I'd implore the patient to give this cannabidiol a try, also due to its side effects being nowhere near as tormenting as chemo.   (Depending on the patient's home state, may require moving to CO or other states that allow it.)   Seriously, you do to need to worry about being perfect,   I guess you meant:   Seriously, you do not need to worry about being perfect,      The abbreviation is TIL,    I know, but TILT sure sounded better."
askwomenadvice,3ahs00,MuppetManiac,7,Sun Jun 21 00:52:20 2015 UTC,"So basically you'd spew some shit you know nothing about, and then expect her to be ready to date you...  Yeah, you should never ever attempt to date. Don't even try."
askwomenadvice,3ahs00,elombardi,-3,Sun Jun 21 01:05:33 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you should never ever attempt to date. Don't even try.   If females are at least two years more mature than males, why do they still judge? Especially in this kind of acerbic manner?   And by the way, practice makes perfect. Sure, it takes longer to ace than others, but every round of practice = one round closer to, what's the term, ""hitting it off?"" (Whatever it is for succeeding well enough to get to some higher levels in the relationship.)   So basically you'd spew some shit you know nothing about, and then expect her to be ready to date you...   I'm sorry that your flair didn't say, ""I have a LOT of eggshells for you to tiptoe around"" but what do you know about hemp oil and its treatment of cancer? And do you have sources to back up any counterpoints about it?"
askwomenadvice,3agw7f,mumsteady24,2,Sat Jun 20 01:50:17 2015 UTC,I can't even figure out what your question is? Are you trying to ask out more girls? Are you asking how to get beyond the first couple dates?
askwomenadvice,3agw7f,MadtownMaven,1 point,Sat Jun 20 10:54:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah that's exactly what I'm asking. Sorry, a girl I was dating had just explained why we faded, so my thoughts were a little jumbled."
askwomenadvice,3agw7f,hoodlummer,1 point,Sat Jun 20 16:45:48 2015 UTC,relationships always end until one doesn't. Your problem is that you just haven't found the one to jibe with yet and its causing too much anxiety and pressure in your head and you're overthinking things.   She did you a favor by ending things early. Now you know and you can move on to keep looking.
askwomenadvice,3agw7f,EarwormsRUs,1 point,Sat Jun 20 22:46:18 2015 UTC,"If you're generally glowing like a 5 Watt bulb (due to tiredness and/or timidity) then I think few women will find you attractive enough to (continue) pursing you. Dating and sex are supposed to be fun, an adventure. Lighten up about them, and maybe life in general."

askwomenadvice,3agepy,punyhumanmaggot,5,Fri Jun 19 22:58:31 2015 UTC,"I would give her a heads up, but do it like it's no big deal. Like, ""Oh, and just so you know, I have a speech impediment [type of impediment]. Just wanted to give you a heads up so you're not surprised. See you there!""  I can't tell you if it will be a dealbreaker or not with any certainty, but I doubt it would be if you guys already have a good connection."
askwomenadvice,3agepy,carboncle,2,Fri Jun 19 23:52:36 2015 UTC,"If she really likes you, she'll easily look past it. My SO has a speech impediment, I hardly notice it. It never bothered me from the start. When it comes time to meet family/friends, etc, I won't be ""warning"" anybody ahead of time, fuck them if they can't be accepting of something that can't be controlled, this isn't a case of Herpes or anything else putting others at risk. You can ""warn"" her if you feel the need, but I don't think it's necessary. I find ""warnings"" incredibly disrespectful and just shitty to the affected person. She may have a few questions about it, but I don't think a warning is necessary.  Good luck man!"
askwomenadvice,3agepy,Evildruidtalena187,1 point,Fri Jun 19 23:59:38 2015 UTC,"Personally it would depend on the type of speech impediment. Lisp, slur, etc and I don't think it needs to be mentioned. If it's a stutter, I would mention it only so you could add how you'd like her to react/help with it. Something like ""hey just a heads up, I've got a slight stutter. I'm cool with it, but wanted to let you know so if it pops up, just give me a few moments and I eventually spit the word out."" Or something like that. Giving someone the script for how to react about something that is out of their wheelhouse can help eliviate awkwardness."
askwomenadvice,3agepy,MadtownMaven,1 point,Sat Jun 20 10:59:51 2015 UTC,"I would be totally unfazed if he mentioned it before we met up. I think that's a really understandable thing to do if you're nervous about it. I think I'd be a little surprised if he didn't tell me--not put off at all, but it'd catch me off guard. So telling her ahead of time, with the ""oh yeah just a thing, no big deal"" approach, serves to both quell your anxiety and avoid her surprise.  I think it's really unlikely she would lose interest if you get very well and she is interested enough to meet you."
askwomenadvice,3agepy,glorioid,0,Sun Jun 21 04:52:32 2015 UTC,"My man. I don't know the details, but if it's a lisp, or slurring, or whatever...don't feel embarrassed. I can tell you that you could look like a butthole with a mouth, and if you're well groomed, confident, and happy. Your worth is just that. YOU decide it. Here is a silly analogy. Would you drive a maserati if it had a small scratch on it?  Fuck yes. Now  picture a fucking dude making a big deal about the scratch and commenting on how ALL the girls would point it out...and basically let you know it's ""just awful""... Don't be that guy.  If it's an issue she'll TELL you. And if she's that kinnnnnnd of girl...you my man fucking win by avoiding her!   Btw, I have a fucking broken jaw. Seriously. One side of my face is different than the other. It's off by 7mm!  I'm at a hotel waiting on this girl top show up. Girls don't care. So why should you?   Be most AWESOME little dude."
askwomenadvice,3afvmp,drowningincheese,6,Fri Jun 19 20:21:26 2015 UTC,"If you want to be with the new person, you need to break up with your SO. If you want things to work out with your SO, you need to cut contact with the new person. They are mutually exclusive as far as your attention is concerned; there is no way to have both in your situation.  As for which of those options you should choose, it's up to you. I'll offer some caution: it's quite likely that this new person is so attractive to you because he highlights things that you dislike about your relationship/SO. That's instructive in terms of what's wrong with your relationship, but it means it's likely this new person isn't exactly ""the one."" Which could be OK. Maybe a catalyst is what you're looking for. Sometimes this kind of thing is a wakeup call that you should listen to.  On the other hand, remember that feelings aren't destiny and love takes effort. It should usually be happy effort, but it doesn't always have to be. If you're pouring more energy into the new person than the old one, that's probably a big part of why you feel so much more connected to him. Take a hard look at your relationship, and the actual actions you and your partner are taking or have taken. ""We are just growing apart"" makes it sound like a natural process in which you have no agency, and I sincerely doubt that is the case.   Either way, it's up to you. But you have to pick one. Going the way you're going absolutely will blow up in everybody's face."
askwomenadvice,3afvmp,carboncle,2,Fri Jun 19 20:44:19 2015 UTC,"I had literally the same thing happen to me. I had been with my ex for almost 6 years and things were not going well (high school sweethearts gone bad). I met someone I worked with that was everything I'd been missing. I ended up breaking up with my ex and exploring this new friendship I had with my work friend and a few months later we started to date. Now it's been 4 years and we hope to marry soon. Now, I know every situation is different, but I didn't realize how unhappy I really was until I met my current boyfriend.   If I were you I would think ""Do I want to marry (your current s/o)?"" ""Do I want to spend the rest of my life with him?"" My answer was clear, and although it took my a while to get the courage to finally end things, it was for the best.  Good luck!!! :)"
askwomenadvice,3afvmp,biggestb,1 point,Fri Jun 19 23:45:13 2015 UTC,"We text each other, and are extremely friendly and flirtatious with each other.   You've already crossed a line. You need to be a good person in this. I've been in this exact situation, and in the moment I felt out of control, but since making my own mistakes I've realized it was my own ignorance making me feel like everything ""just happened"".  If you continue down this road something bad WILL happen. Don't believe that you can continue your behavior with this guy and things will stay ""just"" flirtatious.  You need to be honest with your BF. You're emotionally cheating on him, getting your butterflies and romance from someone else.  You said your whole relationship has been rocky... Why have you stayed? Do you think this how relationships are supposed to be? I mean, the early relationship is where things are easy, it only gets harder with time..."
