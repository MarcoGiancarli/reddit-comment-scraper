I recommend a metal burger flipper.  Ingredients   Serves 2   Fast fry beef 200 - 400g Slices provolone cheese   10 Sliced mushrooms  1/2 cup Orange pepper, sliced 1/4 Slices texas/Italian cut bread    4 Butter    4 tbsps Montreal Steak Spice Horseradish sauce 2-4 tbsps   Steps   Season the beef evenly on both sides with montreal steak spice. Slice into small enough pieces to fit in the pan and on the bread if necessary. Melt 1 tbsp butter in a cast iron skillet on medium. Brown beef on both sides, then side aside on a plate and cover with foil Add another tbsp butter to the pan along with veggies. Season with salt and saute til mushrooms begin to brown- about 3 minutes. Butter one side of each slice of bread with remaining butter. Flip slices and lightly spread on horseradish sauce. Heat a grill pan on medium-high. Place one piece of bread on the grill pan butter side down. Lay down 2 slices of cheese, then half the steak, then 1 slice of cheese in the center, then 2 slices cheese, then another slice of bread butter side up. Cover pan and allow bread to toast for 30-90 seconds. Check the bottom slice for desired toastiness, then get a spatula under the sandwich, press down on the top piece and quickly flip the sandwich. 1. Cover and toast again for another 30-90 seconds."

Problem was 2 fold- it's fast fry so it's hard to hit the desired done-ness and also it was a little too thick so even though it looks medium in the pic it was still quite chewy which made the sandwhich harder to eat. In the future I might grab a striploin and slice it thinly instead of using fast fry."

We started by just getting a range of our favourite ingredients and adding it to a sandwich, which keeps it varied and interesting!   This ones a chicken breast schnitzel, with tasty cheddar cheese, red onion, tomato, cucumber, bacon, beetroot, red apple and lettuce. Though the star of the sandwich is the (Guacamole-like) avocado mix:  Take an avocado, half the juice of a lime, diced red onion and a fist full of chopped coriander and mash with a fork, season to taste with salt and pepper.  Now on to my favourite part of the Monster Chicken Sanga's! The condements:  Corn relish, mayonnaise, savoury tomato chutney, and american style mustard.   Notes:   Was very happy with the sweetness of the red apple in this one! I want to try eggplant in the next one. Anyone had any experiences with it? Oh its just toasted white bread by the way Corned beef instead of chicken is a good option If your a vegetarian, just don't put the chicken in and keep the rest (no cheese too if your that way inclined). The star of the sandwich is the avocado mix"

eatsandwiches,3cpsm7,Julianfrost,4,Thu Jul 9 23:42:42 2015 UTC,Grated (not shredded) parmesan. Not the prepackaged kind. Coat the outside of the sandwich with butter and grated parmesan before grilling to get a really nice crust.
eatsandwiches,3cpsm7,kindlebluemoon,3,Thu Jul 9 22:08:12 2015 UTC,"I butter the inside and outside of the bread. I like sharp cheddar and I use a lot of it. I put it in a pan on the (glass top electric) stove at medium low setting,  like about 3.5 or 4 on the dial. I only flip once so it's important to make sure your cheese is melted and the bread is golden brown or else it's going to fall apart on the flip. Usually on 3.5 on my stove dial that takes about 10 mins.for side one. Then flip in place, the second side will go much faster probably like 3 mins. Cut that SOB in half and pile some chips in the middle."
eatsandwiches,3cpsm7,CopyCenterPhil,3,Thu Jul 9 21:37:44 2015 UTC,"Start with good bread. Too many people forget this. If you're using shitty white bread you're going to end up with a shitty sandwich. Personally I prefer a good sourdough for a generic grilled cheese, but if you want to try getting a little exotic with your cheese's Rye bread will hold up very well to anything you can throw at it. Another interesting combination would be pumpernickel with Clive butter and creamy white cheeses maybe with thinly sliced apples in there.   My cheese profile for a standard grilled on sourdough is roughly 60-65% sharp cheddar, 20-30% Muenster, and the remaining is whatever caught my eye when I was buying cheese. Usually something pretty distinct like a smoked provolone or an aged gouda, something to give it a little extra kick. The point of the Muenster is to prevent the cheddar from having its oil separate and ending up with a gritty, leaky mess of a sandwich. Monterey Jack also works to this end. It's just key to not over dilute the sharpness of the cheddar.   Make sure your cheese is grated and your bread is buttered on the outside. Load up the cheese on one slice of bread and put it into your hot skillet. After it has a nice golden brown crust put in your tomatoes, bacon or what-have-you, top with the second slice of bread and flip it over. When that side is golden brown too put a little bit of extra cheese on the top and flip it over again. Repeat with the other side once the cheese is crispy. Let the cheese set before you cut into it, otherwise it's going to run over the place.   And then personally I like to dip in pickle juice."
eatsandwiches,3cpsm7,geistforce,3,Thu Jul 9 23:44:17 2015 UTC,That pickle juice idea is a fucking game changer.
eatsandwiches,3cpsm7,sloof70,3,Thu Jul 9 23:46:38 2015 UTC,"Mayo on the outside of the bread instead of butter. It makes the perfect golden brown outer crust every time. I thought it was crazy till I tried it, and now I'd never do anything else. The bread and cheese you can play with because variety is fun, but the mayo is a must."

eatsandwiches,3cpsm7,eye-jay-eh,2,Fri Jul 10 06:30:26 2015 UTC,"The trick I've been using a lot lately is to add something sweet to the grilled cheese. Two of my favorite recent combinations are brie, sliced pear, and black pepper and then goat cheese and balsamic glaze (did this with the honey goat cheese from Trader Joe's the first time but it was way too sweet).  Other tricks that help a lot are to mess around and find the right temperature setting for the pan you use (I use a real thin non-stick so I end up doing it on medium-high, could do a lower temp. on a heavier duty pan etc.) and use way more fat than you think you need. A good grilled cheese should leave your fingers greasy!"

Most commonly you pan fry it and put it on a sandwich. (Have to cut little notches though so it doesn't ""cup""!)

eatsandwiches,3bnexh,masimbasqueeze,9,Tue Jun 30 19:16:56 2015 UTC,"Yes.  http://www.eater.com/2015/4/10/8370993/federal-donuts-philadelphia-fried-chicken-michael-solomonov   The first fry happens immediately after the chicken is battered. Fein lowers the chicken pieces into a deep fryer filled with canola oil. Canola oil is versatile and flavor-neutral, says Fein, and it's a safe choice for customers since there's no allergens like soy or peanuts. Fein will let excess batter drip off the pieces, then lightly places the chicken into the oil before letting the piece go. As they fry, Fein will make sure they don't stick together. This first fry blanches the chicken, each piece taking a different amount of time. (The frying station at the commissary is surrounded by timers.) All curing and blanching happens under Fein and his crew's watch at the commissary.  The second fry is done a la minute. It also happens in canola oil, but this oil is even hotter than the first time around. Timers once again play a critical role. The finished pieces turn a ""deep golden brown"" and Fein notes that the oil still bubbles on the skin as it comes out of the fryer. The second fry cooks the chicken through and creates the super-crispy skin Federal Donuts' chicken is known for."

But if you wanted it with Dijon I would do it all day long!"

eatsandwiches,3bf4rq,thesmokedjoint,8,Sun Jun 28 18:21:56 2015 UTC,I did! I bought a brisket from my local butcher and used a local sauce that I fell in love with a few years ago. The aioli recipe is from Chowhound.
eatsandwiches,3bf4rq,thesmokedjoint,2,Sun Jun 28 18:28:27 2015 UTC,whats the ratio of chipotle to cinnamon?
eatsandwiches,3bf4rq,thesmokedjoint,2,Mon Jun 29 03:10:27 2015 UTC,"2:1, but the rub is mainly brown sugar- here's a loose estimation of the recipe I use.

Anything more, and you are making meatloaf on a bun."

eatsandwiches,3a61e7,ShepardtoyouSheep,6,Wed Jun 17 15:41:34 2015 UTC,"1 package boneless skinless chicken breasts  1 cup flour(I used coconut flour)  Bread of your choice(I used a ciabatta loaf I found at stop and shop)  2-3 cups(One of those small tins is fine) Panko Breadcrumbs  3-4 eggs(3 whites 1 yolk)  1/4 cup milk  Hot sauce of your choice(I used franks red hot).  Blue Cheese Dressing of your choice(creamy works better than chunky)  2-3 stalks of celery  2-3 large carrots  Salt  Pepper  Red Pepper Flakes  Oregano  Garlic Powder  Onion Powder    Preheat oven to 375, grease a baking sheet, and get 3 bowls/plates to bread your cutlets with.  1.) In the first bowl, flour.  2.) In the second bowl, mix  egg whites, yolk, and milk.  3.) In the final bowl, combine breadcrumbs and a handful of each seasoning, with the exception of the hot red pepper flakes, depending on how hot you want them.  4.) Place each cutlet in the flour, followed by the egg, and finally into the breadcrumb mixture, then place on the baking sheet.  5.) Bake for 15 minutes, flipping about halfway through. I drizzled a bit of olive oil over them as well to give them some extra fried crunch.  6.) In the mean time, finely chop the carrots and celery, and mix together with the blue cheese dressing.   8.) When your cutlets are finished, remove and slice into strips.  7.) Slice your bread as desired, place a generous layer of the blue cheese/carrot/celery mixture on the bottom half, followed by a few strips of chicken, hot sauce, and more blue cheese if desired.  8.) Brush top half of bread with olive oil, place everything onto baking sheet and bake for about 4 minutes.  9.) Remove  from oven and enjoy."

I'm a dedicated fan of buffalo chicken sandwiches, pizzas, calzones, etc., and too many places try to fuck with a masterpiece and add caramelized onion, red pepper, bacon, etc., which in my opinion distracts from the beautiful contrasts going on with the classic buffalo chicken flavors - hot and cool items, spicy and creamy items, crunch, etc. This looks pretty ideal."

eatsandwiches,39r3g7,nxqv,1 point,Sun Jun 14 17:23:45 2015 UTC,"I have no idea about what parsley is (would translate it later, I'm on my phone now).   Chimichurry is red and spicy, red pepper is a mandatory ingredient. Also, you don't consume it ""fresh"", you have to let it settle and that makes the oil (not olive)  get red.   I heard that the name comes from an englishman that was eating ""asado"" with some ""gauchos"". He asked for more of it without knowing the name and said ""give me the curry"". I don't know how someone would get chimichurri from it, your ear gets messed up when you don't know what the other person is saying. It's just a thing that I heard. Not sure if its real.   I happen to have some in the fridge. Will take a picture of it if you're interested."

U.S. Government regulations require American bologna to be finely ground   and without visible pieces of lard. Bologna can alternatively be made out of chicken, turkey, beef, pork, venison or soy protein. Unlike the mortadella, bologna sausage is not an Italian product and there are several differences among process and ingredients. Typical seasoning for bologna includes black pepper, nutmeg, allspice, celery seed, coriander, and like mortadella, myrtle berries give it its distinctive flavor.

Start with this one from Alton Brown. It's not so much a good honey mustard recipe as it is a good starting point.  I like to add a good amount of cayenne pepper to mine to give it a nice kick on the back end or sometimes cajun seasoning, you can also experiment with the vinegars you use but I keep it simple and just use white vinegar.  Play around with proportions until you get it tasting the way you like. The great thing about dipping sauce recipes is you can make pretty small batches then once you get it the way you like, you can scale it up for bigger batches down the line.

The author doesn't seem to have a problem with this sandwich so much as he has a problem with the concept of sandwiches in general.  Sandwiches are essentially working class food.

Then it became popular as a sort of picnic food.    Weighting it compresses the sandwich, and makes it more compact and easier to carry and slice.  Made with hot steaks, the weight presses the warm juice into the bread, then as the sandwich cools, the juice ""sets"".  So after you take the weight off, the bread stays compressed and won't refill with air."

It has been marketed in the United States since the early 1960s for use as a condiment with meat or game dishes. In May 2014, Kraft Foods announced it was dropping the ""steak"" from the A.1. name reverting to A.1 Sauce, to ""reflect modern dining habits"".  A.1. was originally developed, produced, and marketed in the United Kingdom as a brand in 1831, and was officially registered as a trademark in the U.S. in 1895, and imported and distributed in the United States by G.F. Heublein & Bros in 1906. Although the sauce is widely available in the U.S. and Canada, in the UK, it is currently only sold by Tesco and Ocado.

It is served atop slices of white bread with pickle chips. It is both the application of a spicy paste and the presentation that differentiates it from similar dishes, such as Buffalo wings.

eatsandwiches,38d566,haley744,1 point,Thu Jun 4 14:20:04 2015 UTC,"FWIW, I have had cheesesteaks in Nashville, made by Philly natives in a food truck, and they had Amoroso's shipped in every day.  They were awesome, and (I kinda liked this) they refused to offer the Whiz (until the last few months of their operation, when they kept a jar but didn't advertise it).  Their water ices were spot-on too.  Occasionally they had those cherry peppers that pushed it one notch higher.  They were successful enough to shut down the truck in prep for opening a brick-&-mortar place . . . I'm still waiting!"

eatsandwiches,38d566,turnpikenorth,1 point,Wed Jun 3 21:42:22 2015 UTC,"We actually don't eat as many cheesesteaks as you would think. They're mainly reserved for times where you're snot-slinging drunk and really need something to soak up all the booze. The major tourist places (Pat's King of Steaks, Geno's, Jim's) are really lackluster when you're sober but Pat's is my jam when I'm hammered.   My aunt lives in Baltimore and I get down there pretty frequently. I still have not had a better crab cake than her secret recipe for them. The best part about her secret recipe is that it's not a secret. It's on the can of Old Bay seasoning. They come out perfect every single time if you can get your hands on some really good jumbo lump crab meat.   Since you've moved to Jersey, have you introduced yourself to the glory that is Taylor Pork Roll? I work for a newspaper conglomerate and end up working at The Trentonian quite a few times a month and Trentonians take their Pork Roll extremely seriously. It's the second best breakfast meat next to scrapple. If you haven't had some. Get some tomorrow morning. You'll thank me later."

Old Bay.  Actually when we moved in the cable guy was telling us some places to go and he said make sure you get taylor ham, egg and cheese on a everything bagel for breakfast. I had never heard of it before, but yeah, its amazing and I keep a log around to make the occasional sandwich.   And yes, scrapple + maple syrup + fried eggs = heaven."

My brother and I will go to Ottawa for the Animation Festival, and eat at Shawarma King, like multiple times a day we're there. I'm not kidding when I say we ate there 11 times over 5 days we were there one year. It's just that fucking good. Even other shawarma shops in Toronto I've hit are better than all I've had in Michigan and around the country. And I've been in and around Dearborn Michigan, where you'd expect to find the best shawarma wraps."
eatsandwiches,37q9xu,Bilgerman,17,Fri May 29 15:25:08 2015 UTC,"Make bacon. Once crispy, leave on towels to cool. Strain bacon fat and add to clean pan (do not deglaze bacon pan).  Over medium heat, fry tomato slices. Brown 1-2 minutes each side. Remove tomatoes and add rings of red onion to pan. Cook until soft with brown edges.  Spread mayo or sour cream on both sides of toast (I used whole wheat but you could probably use just about anything; a thick tortilla or pita would be great). Slice 1/2 an avocado and layer on each piece of bread.  Layer tomatoes, bacon, and onion in the order your food engineering mind thinks best and drizzle on hot sauce to taste. Close sandwich. Place in face. Chew."

eatsandwiches,37q9xu,crazymoefaux,3,Sat May 30 02:44:41 2015 UTC,Holy shit this sounds amazing. Kicking myself for forgetting to buy bread this week...
eatsandwiches,37q9xu,crazymoefaux,2,Fri May 29 19:06:07 2015 UTC,"Serious question because I've never once fried a red onion. How does it taste in comparison to a regular white or yellow onion? I'm assuming here there was a lot of bacon flavor, but if I just fried one in butter or something, what difference would it make?"
eatsandwiches,37q9xu,The_peep,2,Fri May 29 23:02:02 2015 UTC,"They're sweeter than yellow onions, so they don't take as much time in a pan to get brown. Yellow and white onions tend to keep that sharp sulfuric flavor a little longer. So frying red onions gets you an onion that's just as sweet but a little crisper than yellow or white.  However, if you do fully caramelize them, they're very sweet. And because there's more sugar in them they tend to burn much more easily. They also lose that beautiful bright purple color. So I usually use yellow onions if I'm going to make caramelized onions and save the red onions for thin sliced raw and thick sliced quick fried applications like this."
eatsandwiches,37q9xu,Insane_Drako,6,Sat May 30 00:01:17 2015 UTC,"Personally, I like to completely caramelize my onions.  It takes a bit longer, but I think it's well worth it.  Use more onion, because they will cook down a lot more.  Cook them over low heat with whatever oil or fat you like, bacon drippings are totally fine.  Cook them for about 20 minutes, until they take on a rich, coffee-like color.  If you cook your bacon low and slow, it should take about the same amount of time anyway."
eatsandwiches,37q9xu,cakekween,7,Fri May 29 20:54:00 2015 UTC,"I wanted the onions a little crispy still. Caramelized onions are great, but that would have been a lot of soft food around a thin layer of bacon. This way, you get the meaty crisp, veggie crunch, and smooth tomato and avocado. Just wanted to add a little variety to the texture."
eatsandwiches,37q9xu,MaC1222,2,Fri May 29 20:58:31 2015 UTC,"Fair enough, texture is a legit reason to just lightly fry them."

Another is that because you're cooking it at a low temp, it's more challenging to cook to med rare, and easier to overcook the burger."

U.S. Government regulations require American bologna to be finely ground   and without visible pieces of lard. Bologna can alternatively be made out of chicken, turkey, beef, pork, venison or soy protein. Unlike the mortadella Bologna, bologna sausage is not an Italian product and there are several differences among process and ingredients. Typical seasoning for bologna includes black pepper, nutmeg, allspice, celery seed, coriander, and like mortadella, myrtle berries give it its distinctive flavor.

Schwartz has definitely gone downhill since it sold itself.  The one across the street is twice as good and has almost no line because it isn't overhyped like Schwartz which has seriously gotten lazy with their sandwiches.  Also a good suggestion, though pricy as hell, Reuben's on St-Catherine. Their Del Monico Sandwich is 20 bucks, overpriced, but my go-to for a sandwich when I want to indulge.  Also, shoutout to Pick's. Crazy good Korean burger place; it's a hole in the wall and it's amazing."

eatsandwiches,35ylvo,bob-leblaw,2,Thu May 14 16:46:48 2015 UTC,"my favourite sandwich is aged gouda, grilled sweet peppers and aioli   im sure you can make a wrap from that, add some arugula or spinach would work   you can always make a nicely filled tzatziki   just get 500 ml greek yoghurt (or more :D) add about half a large cucumber (first cut it in half lengthwise , then slices , lightly salt to get some moisture out)  Add black pepper and garlic to taste , for a extra bit of kick crumble in some feta or add cashews/almonds   it'll go well with most wraps, veggie or otherwise  i guess if you told us what kinds of veggie wraps you were making it'd be easier"
eatsandwiches,35ylvo,Nickvee,2,Thu May 14 17:51:02 2015 UTC,"-Mix cream cheese and avocado for a nice spread, that goes well with spinach cucumber tomato etc...Italian dressing for a nice zing   -hummus would go well with grilled portobello, grilled zucchini, roast bell, etc...toss veggies in balsamic vinegar   -lettuce wraps or lettuce cups with salads inside (for instance goat cheese, beets, pickled onions and pistachio salad with orange zest inside a butter leaf 'cup') the sky is the limit...  -also..spring rolls are not super difficult to make, if you can get a hold of circular rice paper all you do is soak the small rice sheets in water for 30 seconds and they become soft and easily pliable.  Make some uniformly cut veggie strips (carrots, celery, bell pep, tofu, bean sprouts, light Asian dressing) and roll the items inside the soaked pliable wraps almost like a burrito, very simple if you organize properly...

eatsandwiches,35um3l,DoubleTrump,1 point,Thu May 14 01:09:50 2015 UTC,"Sure thing! I make these in the bread machine, so my ingredients/method reflect that.  Ingredients:   1 cup water or milk 1 large egg 1 1/2 tsps sugar 1 tsp salt 2 tbs unsalted butter or oil (like using coconut oil) 3 cups all purpose flour 1 1/2 tsps yeast (optional, 2 tbs dried milk powder if not using milk)   Place all the wet ingredients in the bread mixer first. Put the dry stuff in in whatever order you like as long as the yeast goes in last (make a little divot in the flour to put the yeast in).  Run the dough cycle, checking to make sure it looks like it's the right consistency about ten minutes in. Add more water or flour as necessary. Once that's done, take the dough out and shape it into buns. This recipe makes about eight buns the size you see in the picture. Place on a pan (I like to put parchment paper on the pan to keep them from getting stuck) and let rise for about 30-45 minutes depending on how warm your house is.  Preheat the oven to 425ºF and brush the tops with butter or egg whites or something if you want (I never do). Bake for about 13-15 minutes, until they're golden brown and sound hollow when you tap the top with your fingernail. I like to do 8 minutes then spin the pan around because my oven sucks and then see how much longer they need at that point. Often they only need an additional 3-5 minutes.  Recipe originally from here but I've modified it somewhat and don't do the weird kaiser stamp thing."

They're certainly a commonly available item, but they're by no means default. If you walk into any restaurant in Philly and order a cheesesteak, you're just going to get steak and cheese on a roll. Onions are a popular addition, but you generally need to specify if you want it ""wit"" onions.  Not that anyone will frown on you for getting it with peppers, most places offer them and everyone has their own preference, I like mine with cheez whiz, mushrooms, and fried onions, my sister likes american cheese, and fried onions, my parents like them with provolone cheese, tomato sauce, pickles, and fried onions, pizza steaks are a common variant with tomato sauce, mozzarella, and sometimes pepperoni, it's a flexible food  What keeps this from being a cheesesteak to me is the fact that he started with roast beef instead of thinly sliced steak fried on a grill. If someone tried to serve me this as a cheesesteak I'd send it back because this is in fact a roast beef sandwich with cheese."

The term primarily refers to small hamburgers, but can also cover any small sandwich served on a slider roll.   The term, when used in reference to a small hamburger, refers to a small hamburger patty served on a small bun. The origin of the term is unknown. White Castle trademarked the spelling variant ""Slyder"" and used it between 1985 and 2009.   Sliders can be served as an hors d'oeuvre/appetizer, amuse-bouche, or entrée.

eatsandwiches,3578qv,strongdoge,2,Thu May 7 19:21:50 2015 UTC,"thanks! basically used this recipe only upped the hydration to 75% and did a two day cold ferment, didn't use pistachios either (I tend not to like nuts)   http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2015/02/easy-no-knead-olive-rosemary-pistachio-focaccia-kenji-recipe.html"
eatsandwiches,3578qv,TheFats216,1 point,Thu May 7 19:23:39 2015 UTC,did you use bread flour or plain?  Ive never gotten the full professional bubbly bread
eatsandwiches,3578qv,strongdoge,2,Thu May 7 20:09:05 2015 UTC,"I used bread flour, which I think does help the bread bubble a bit because of its high protein, but I think more important than the type of flour (especially for my bullshit rinky-dink oven) is first a high-ish hydration, and second to really let the flour soak up all the water, which is only accomplished with time (the cold ferment helps with the latter, and also helps with the flavor). Doughs that seem very stiff at first are almost able to be poured after a few days.     Are you handling your dough too much, maybe? Once I started doing my best to leave the dough alone my problem became more that I get too much bubbling sometimes. Are you using a scale for weight measurement rather than volumetric measurement?      edit: sorry I can't be of more help. thinking about it I'm not sure when I started getting happy with my bread - I was just reading a lot about bread and a year ago something clicked. have you read Tartine Bread? great resource. I steer towards the no-knead breads because that style is better for my schedule, but the best breads I've ever made came by slavishly following the instructions in that book."
