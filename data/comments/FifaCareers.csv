FifaCareers,3e3065,Illest_Son,26,Tue Jul 21 15:51:24 2015 UTC,If you signed him with a lower league team you'd use your entire transfer budget printing his name on his shirt
FifaCareers,3e3065,ScoutingGod,14,Tue Jul 21 16:33:18 2015 UTC,You could probably summon an ancient god if you chanted that name in a pentagram three times.

FifaCareers,3e45e7,mashedpotatoes42,2,Tue Jul 21 20:33:26 2015 UTC,Derby is good. Hughes and Ince are quality. Also Norwich
FifaCareers,3e4nth,Heroic_Lifesaver,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:45:41 2015 UTC,This is actually the closest coming to rage quitting a career... I'm getting a new injury almost every match. Ospina is only just back from 7 months out too. Had problems last season with Welbeck and Lacazette being injured on and off but this is ridiculous.   3 goalless draws in a row in the league too. Dicking about mid table... But still in the league cup and top of my Champions League group after 4 games. Legendary mode is a bollocks but it's made sooo much harder when I'm missing half my first team
FifaCareers,3e4nth,mech999man,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:48:50 2015 UTC,Are you simming a lot of matches.
FifaCareers,3e355l,Dovless,2,Tue Jul 21 16:26:44 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure that they get some of them through youth scouting. Because sometimes when i leave my scout report for another month and don't open it. Ill look at it and other teams will have taken some of the players.
FifaCareers,3e355l,testical_heritage,3,Tue Jul 21 17:02:38 2015 UTC,"Those players never turn up though on my careers, they're forever lost. I think the CPU gets randomly generated players every once in a while"
FifaCareers,3e3bc4,bellboy3,3,Tue Jul 21 17:08:56 2015 UTC,"to answer both questions, Yes and also no.  So players will want to join your club based on your current star rating, and you will get a budget based on this as well. The problem is that your star rating is only based on your players overall. So if you are good at the game you will likely end up in the BPL with a team with a very low rating, resulting in a low budget at players ranking your team as less desirable even if you are doing really well. A funny side effect of this is that bigger teams will play back up players against you even if you are a direct rival to their position in the table. I once played Chelsea in the last match of the season in a game where the winner would be champions where they put out a team with almost all back ups."
FifaCareers,3e3bc4,Varsted,2,Tue Jul 21 18:07:42 2015 UTC,"I'm at 2025 with Newport County, and my budget is 14M, it was 400K at the beginning i think, some players didn't want to come at some point saying that my team was not good for them but that is just more money; the problem i have now is that my scouts can't find any good players, 1st team quality is useless and world quality just bring me the YA players i sold, so i have to manually look for players that i need, that is annoying."
FifaCareers,3e3bc4,PierreSosa,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:05:23 2015 UTC,"I am having this same problem, scouts cant find anyone based on the traits im looking for. Any tips on finding good players? How do you search for quality players?"
FifaCareers,3e3bc4,JosephAlwaysStalin,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:36:26 2015 UTC,Only roadblock I can think of is that you have to wait untill your second season in the PL to expect any kind of decent transfer budget. I think I even got a worse budget in League 1 than 2 with my Southend team. Once in the PL though I rarely had any problems getting decent enough players.
FifaCareers,3e41pw,Smash_Brothers,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:07:29 2015 UTC,Gatt is a pretty good signing.

FifaCareers,3e01b5,SupaHotSackboy,15,Mon Jul 20 22:59:10 2015 UTC,He's suprisingly fast. I'd compare him to mertesacker sprinting.
FifaCareers,3e01b5,SupaHotSackboy,15,Mon Jul 20 23:20:43 2015 UTC,That's probably the blistering 35 agility kicking in.
FifaCareers,3e01b5,10015329,7,Mon Jul 20 23:24:37 2015 UTC,With a jumping of 4 does he just get on his toes?

FifaCareers,3e1o35,EriCOYS,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:42:42 2015 UTC,Yes. He's too slow as a winger for me. Plus Townsend is English and I'm hoping he'll eventually develop better than Lamela would have.
FifaCareers,3e1o35,AbideMan,3,Tue Jul 21 14:50:26 2015 UTC,"To each their own. I love Lamela, he's 28 and an 85 overall in my Spurs save. Townsend is a good player in game as well though. Good luck."

His growth has been incredible. I want to eventually play him in the midfield but my midfield is pretty clogged with talent as it is already.
FifaCareers,3dzday,Scuttle-B,2,Tue Jul 21 03:19:26 2015 UTC,"I'm in 2026 or 7 now, and he's still an 89. Peaked at 93. An absolute beast."
