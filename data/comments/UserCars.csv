UserCars,3e45sl,anossov,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:28:22 2015 UTC,The rails or the bike rack? The rails screw into factory locations on the roof of the car. Just have to flip up an opening to access the mount locations. The bike rack has like 2 rubber pieces that you tighten around the rails.

How long did it take you?  Stop anywhere interesting?  Issues with traffic?  Any neat stories you want to share with the community?"
UserCars,3dpnl7,fredrodgers,3,Sat Jul 18 14:47:05 2015 UTC,"I got about 28 ~ 29 MPG most of the way through WA, OR and NorCal. I dropped down to about 24 MPG through LA/Orange/SD counties. Temps were pretty comfortable so we got good mileage through some sections by just cracking the windows and inch and not using A/C. Also there were a lot of portions we had the top off entirely. Feeling the breeze is ultimately more important than MPG =p  We took about four days after visiting friends in the Seattle area. The Olympic Peninsula took an unexpectedly long time to drive, but we drove leisurely the entire trip and stopped wherever we felt like it. We stopped by to visit with friends in Tillamook, OR (cheese!) and spent a half day going through the Redwoods in NorCal. We also spent a day in SF (very surprised at how dry it had gotten... it looks almost like SoCal) and hung out with other NSX owners. We then of course made the most of the Monterey-to-LA drive and met up with friends in the LA/Orange County area before getting to SD to stay with family. We took a ton of pics which I still need to upload, so that'll be posted eventually as well.  Traffic was usually a non-issue. PCH through LA was a shitshow as one might expect, but everywhere else was fine. I do strongly recommend driving the route North-to-South because having the ocean on your side of the road makes for the best views. This drive is bucket list-worthy."

I've been trying to buy back what was my 3rd Probe from a good friend, I sold it to him like 12 years ago. Since the stock turbo is small it doesn't do high boost well, it can't deliver a lot of volume, just high pressure extra heated air. Besides the factory boost cut is at 13 PSI and I found that to be perfect for a mildly modded daily. If you want more boost than that you should do the Thunderbird Turbo Coupe hybrid setup, it's a pretty popular mod and will really wake the car up after 5K. (where the stock turbo fizzles out) I know these car pretty well so if you have any questions feel free to ask. Good luck with it!"

UserCars,3cm5tv,loganbeaupre,3,Thu Jul 9 00:01:30 2015 UTC,I can't decide if I like the grille stripes or not. I dig the color combo though! DCT or 6 speed?  Bonus: My neighbor back in the UK had an Aventador too :) Sweet cars.
UserCars,3cm5tv,svenskfox,3,Thu Jul 9 22:55:32 2015 UTC,"Yessss that's a sexy Aventador. An DCT, I've asked him before why he didn't get it in manual but he told me the the DCT is faster. He still always messes with the paddle shifters though."
UserCars,3cm5tv,svenskfox,3,Thu Jul 9 23:19:06 2015 UTC,"I miss that thing. Made a beautiful noise. I guess he's got a 458 spider now, but I don't live over there anymore.  You know, I personally think the DCT suits the character of the modern M5 better anyway. It's a big luxury cruiser that can still handle the twisties. That said, I'm not a great fan of the argument ""because it's faster."" While technically true, I think most people wouldn't feel the difference!"
UserCars,3cm5tv,e28m5_e36m3,3,Thu Jul 9 23:31:49 2015 UTC,"I don't like the arguement either but to be fair he's had his fair share of manual cars and maybe doesn't like them like he used to.

UserCars,3cm5tv,svenskfox,1 point,Fri Jul 10 00:22:02 2015 UTC,There is a lot more to being faster than 0-60.  The DCT is definitely faster from every point.  It is one of the best transmissions I have ever driven other than the 458 italia's
UserCars,3cm5tv,e28m5_e36m3,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:04:37 2015 UTC,"Oh believe me, I know it's a good gearbox and as I stated above I think it suits the M5 better.   I just hear too many people claiming they bought an auto because it's 2 seconds quicker around a track instead of admitting they (rightfully) don't want to sit in traffic with a manual. Contributes to manufacturers killing off manuals because they think people care more about track times than rowing their own. On something like the GT3 that's fair, but in an M3 or M5, which many people daily drive, I don't think track numbers should trump fun."
UserCars,3cm5tv,svenskfox,1 point,Sun Jul 12 22:19:01 2015 UTC,I just sold my e92 m3 that was a 6 speed.  My coworker has an 2014 m5 with dct.  I have to say that when I drive that m5 that I have the same amount of fun with the dct.  the downshifts are ridiculous.
UserCars,3cm5tv,jorsiem,1 point,Sun Jul 12 22:24:25 2015 UTC,"Agreed! I'll always prefer a good manual on certain cars. M3 I'm a bit torn, depends on where I live. The DCT is very good."

He's very good with his hands from what I've seen and has a pretty good artistic bend, so I'm hopeful it will be a good experience for him."
UserCars,3ckqjs,fericyde,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:23:41 2015 UTC,"Haha I'm the son, I can honestly say that learning to weld on this car got me a job, I was a welder fabricator and did mechanic work for a company for a while before I started college, plus it gives you a great understanding of just how stuff works and that's helped me tremendously, it even applies to the internship I'm doing right now at an engineering company, being my age and your grandsons age it will definitely pay off knowing how to work with your hands and not just on a computer or on paper"
UserCars,3ckqjs,mymassive,2,Thu Jul 9 17:27:32 2015 UTC,Awesome!  So how old were you when you first helped?  Any tips for me (as a mentor)?  My biggest fear is that he will lack patience on the long haul.
UserCars,3ckqjs,BoSknight,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:42:47 2015 UTC,"Well my dad bought a camaro when I was like 6 years old, and he started racing it the next year so it was always me and him going to the track and I'd help load and unload and hold the light and stuff like that then we built his racecar when I was 12 and I helped through that whole build, and it was tough just seeing it there for 4 years but every time we'd get a few hours to work on it and I saw progress it was exciting, I'd say just let him do as much as possible on it as he gets older because that's way more satisfying than watching and try to stay organized, I probably would have finished a year earlier if I wouldn't have spent so much time looking for lost parts and tools haha"
UserCars,3ckqjs,FiddlerOnThePotato,2,Thu Jul 9 18:07:54 2015 UTC,great advice!  I was thinking about organizing all of the parts on the wall of the garage so that as we took stuff off it would go a certain location and to organize the bolts in a similar fashion (I did this for my coyote swap project and it worked well).   I want him to grow up knowing that the world is something he can participate in -- not just be a spectator.  I think this is one way to teach him that.  Please pass along my admiration for your father and son project to your Dad.  You're a lucky man.

I have a buddy who has an identical model that's running 25lbs of boost out of a stock motor with just a set of injectors and a tune, and his screams. They're pretty reliable if you don't drive them like an idiot and leave strips wherever you go. Tunes are easily had with some free software and some spare time on a weekend.

UserCars,3a44g3,kowalski71,1 point,Wed Jun 17 13:59:24 2015 UTC,Are you in the US and just happen to have a Euro front plate? I seem to recall that the US is the only place it was marketed as a Merkur. Neat car though! I have a real soft spot for these.
UserCars,3a44g3,PhreakyByNature,1 point,Wed Jun 17 13:43:34 2015 UTC,"Yes, I'm in the US and have a European plate to show heritage of them being built in KÃ¶ln (Cologne), Germany. I'm the second or third owner of this car and I'm coming up on 58,000 original miles."
UserCars,39spvr,Nounoon,6,Sun Jun 14 11:47:46 2015 UTC,"Beautiful car, but aren't they known for having some serious issues."
UserCars,39spvr,UnraoSandhu,10,Sun Jun 14 14:35:23 2015 UTC,"As an 80's Ferrari it's surely not the most reliable car in the world, but there is a large community of owners who post on forums tutorials of how  to repair the main issues or do the main services, and I intend to do as much as possible myself.  As far as this one is concerned, it just went through a massive restoration and is basically brand new with original parts or updated parts when the original were not available anymore.  Driving it is an amazing experience. It is not a fast car, but the sensations, sound and feelings are hard to describe. It is great to be able to share that with 3 other people in the car, especially when we take turn driving it it makes a great experience that can be shared. But I also feel that a more personal part of the pleasure of owning such a car, is to learn from it.  When there is some issues, I spend a great amount of time trying to understand what went wrong, understand how the system works and how to fix it. The only annoying thing is just that parts are stupidly expensive."
UserCars,39spvr,UnraoSandhu,2,Sun Jun 14 19:18:21 2015 UTC,"that was really well put, i didn't put it into that perspective. i personally would love to have a 348, but just like any Ferrari, the parts are EXPENSIVE. However, you really put things into perspective. Thank you."
UserCars,39spvr,nolanator,1 point,Mon Jun 15 01:57:07 2015 UTC,Very much so
UserCars,39spvr,paulchua,2,Sun Jun 14 17:01:58 2015 UTC,"Beautiful car, congrats!!!"
UserCars,39qtyw,Nounoon,3,Sat Jun 13 21:27:45 2015 UTC,Very nice! I'm glad their design has held up so well over its lifetime. It looks like if you get her professionally polished that red paint would shine like new!
UserCars,39qtyw,Boot_Shrew,2,Sun Jun 14 00:06:19 2015 UTC,"Awesome! These cars check almost every box for me, but I'm terrified of the engine dying after reading internet horror stories! What are your thoughts/experiences on the matter?"
UserCars,39qtyw,Boot_Shrew,6,Sat Jun 13 23:41:38 2015 UTC,OP drives a Mondial- he's heard all the horror stories.
UserCars,39nsbz,thedriftknig,1 point,Sat Jun 13 02:03:48 2015 UTC,"I'm curious. How many miles do you have on it, and do you have any issues with it so far? I'm thinking about getting one. Are there any issues I need to look out for buying one over 50k miles?"

UserCars,39lcv6,SirDigbyChknCaesar,2,Fri Jun 12 16:01:27 2015 UTC,Evo x bolt ons and a tune is good for about 320hp on a reasonable dyno. MHI turbo upgrade and supporting mods gets you around 400.
UserCars,39lcv6,RhetoricalRhetoric,0,Fri Jun 12 18:03:08 2015 UTC,"You can get a lot more than that out of bolt ons. Got a buddy with a full turbo back, intake, UICP, FMIC upgrade and a tune pushing 370hp on a conservative tune."
UserCars,39lcv6,SirDigbyChknCaesar,1 point,Sat Jun 13 00:08:01 2015 UTC,"Maybe on e85 but if you're not then it's just dyno ""magic"". I just spent all day at our Evo dyno day. An X with MHI turbo and supporting mods made 378 on 93 pump fuel."

UserCars,39lcv6,DIGG-DUG,1 point,Sat Jun 13 19:37:08 2015 UTC,Didn't go.. to much heat. Few buddies went. 1 almost got towed but ended up getting box 2 vi and other buddy got box 3 vi lol
UserCars,39m1za,sikedsyko,7,Fri Jun 12 18:07:40 2015 UTC,"Sorry for the loss. As fun as the ST is, it looks like you traded up...I was so scared when I was on the beltway and saw cops blocking the exits. I had just gotten my car out of the shop that previous Monday getting body work from the hail storm at the end of April. Luckily only a portion of the street going to my complex was flooded so I was able to park up the road on the curb and stay dry.  Just out of curiosity, how much water actually got inside the car? The water line looks like it went halfway up the windshield but the car closest to the curb I walked to get in my gate had water up to the windows but inside it was only to the bottom of the seats."
UserCars,39m1za,frsh2fourty,2,Sat Jun 13 02:22:14 2015 UTC,"Love the white hatch man, they are my favorite Subaru"
UserCars,39m1za,Gramual,2,Sat Jun 13 05:12:11 2015 UTC,"The water was high enough that the headrests in the car were full of water. In my girlfriend's RAV4 it was high enough that one of the floor mats floated into the trunk area.  And yeah, a friend of mine ended up sitting on an overpass near 45/Crosstimbers, until some cops directed them off and told them to take Cavalcade over to 59. At some point on Cavalcade he ran into enough water to hydrolock his motor and spent the night sleeping in his flooded car."

UserCars,39m1za,omararod,1 point,Sat Jun 13 08:18:09 2015 UTC,Yeah I  won't miss it. I prefer oversteer.
UserCars,39m1za,Razorwyre,1 point,Sat Jun 13 21:47:46 2015 UTC,"I'm not about to claim that I can handle a RWD car at it's limit, but there is nothing more satisfying than oversteer. Even a laymen can enjoy it at low speed. Just don't turn off the traction control. Leave that to Clarkson and Harris. Or a parking lot. Or a blizzard. The most fun I've had in my car was in a snowstorm in Portland 5 years ago. Blizzak ice tires and RWD. I was the only car on the road. You'll never have more fun at 15mph."
