Thank God mine has a little tabby in him, but even so, he's 17 pounds and 4.5 feet (from tail tip to the tip of his paws stretched out) of pure muscle. He can open any drawer, cupboard or door and climb any shelf; no place is safe in our apartment. He jumps in the bath or shower or sink full of dishes and makes a huge mess. He has popped the screen out of our bedroom window several times to catch birds. And at 5 am, you better get up and feed him if you value your fingers and toes.

The way the aircraft is being flown, and the oh-my-god-don't-touch-anything body language of the passenger, suggests that this is is an experience flight.

That might apply to this aircraft or it might not. From the video, the way the pilot flies suggests he flies this machine an awful lot; I'd say it's reasonable to assume that he's an instructor giving an experience flight, and might have been flying all day.

HoldMyNip,3aoc9a,Mulsanne,17,Mon Jun 22 20:44:07 2015 UTC,"cats don't have a terminal falling velocity   All objects have a terminal velocity.-  I think what you were referring to is the fact that cats are extremely resilient to falling damage when that fall is greater than about 5 stories (~25-30 meters).  While this is true (basically because they slightly slow their descent by assuming a wind-resistant posture and critically because they absorb and diffuse the impact throughout their bodies), it is not relevant to the video. The cats who survive such falls do so because they are very good at righting themselves and landing with precisely equal pressure on all limbs. Falling from a small plane, this would be absolutely impossible, and the cat would land with substantial horizontal momentum which would not end well for the cat. It would basically become a wheel, forcing an uneven distribution of falling impact over the majority of their body, almost certainly killing it.  All of this ignores the fact that much of what was below the cat was water and forest, each presenting their own unique challenges to a soft, falling object.  What's more, it should be noted that cats are severely injured or killed by falls all the time. They simply tilt the odds in their favor through physiological and behavior adaptations when falling under ideal conditions."
HoldMyNip,3aoc9a,aaronsherman,1 point,Mon Jun 22 13:29:26 2015 UTC,"This guy is right. I remember the statistic (don't have a source, sorry) is that 75% of cats survive landing from a vertical fall where they reach terminal velocity. There are some keywords here though. They survive the landing, but there is no guarantee they don't have broken bones, etc. These injuries could later prove fatal. Also, as pointed out by /u/aaronsherman, if the fall isn't vertical or has other complications, the statistic no longer applies.  So, let's be happy this kitty didn't fall. :)"

HoldMyNip,3aoc9a,SarahC,10,Mon Jun 22 14:07:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the pilot looked relaxed when he saw the cat wasn't going anywhere...  Then the kitty just looks out into the wind during the end of the flight, blinking in the wind. In the wing, there mustn't have been any wind.  As soon as he was slow enough on the ground he hopped out, without waiting for it to fully stop... I got the feeling he cared a lot.

I just couldn't take this paragraph seriously:   The common behaviors cats display when they sense the bruised leaves or stems of catnip are: rubbing on the plant, rolling on the ground, pawing at it, licking it, and chewing it. Consuming much of the plant is followed by drooling, sleepiness, anxiety, leaping about and purring. Some growl, meow, scratch or bite at the hand holding it.[23][24] The main response period after exposure is generally between five and fifteen minutes, after which olfactory fatigue usually sets in.""   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nepeta_cataria"
