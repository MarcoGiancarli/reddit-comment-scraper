korea,3e2kv3,Selfselfselfhelp,9,Tue Jul 21 13:52:44 2015 UTC,"Unless you have a lot of money to invest in real estate or starting a business here, no. Korea does not have a general long term expat visa. Like some people retire and take their fortune overseas and go live in some cheap country, you can't do that here without first doing something else.   That said..   If you have enough to buy a modest house here (outside Seoul, I believe $200,000, I have to find the details) you could receive a resident visa. I seem to recall the government stating they would give F2 visas to people who invested in real estate.

Nowadays I hear you need to actually invest the cash because too many people took advantage of it.  Get a D10 visa ""looking for work,"" lasts 6 months, then make a visa run.  Teach part time and get an E2 visa sponsored - this could be as little as 6 hours a week teaching kindergarten in the morning.   Study part time and take a student visa. Then you'll actually get to enjoy Korea more as you learn Korean.   Research on the standard forums via google and you'll see this topic has been discussed time and time again. 70k US will go a long way in Korea and you'll save a lot more than America."
korea,3e2kv3,crossmr,5,Tue Jul 21 14:11:58 2015 UTC,"D8 is now 300 million. See page 80 details current D-8 requirements. It's not the easy visa it once was  A D10 can't just be had out of the blue. he already gets 3 months as an american. They're unlikely to give him a D10 unless he was coming from an existing visa. A D10 requires the following things:   ① Application Form (Form No. 34), Passport, Alien Registration Card, Fee ② Documents proving your job seeking visa qualifications* * certificate of a degree, a proof of employment or other documents proving education and career   6 hours a week is insufficient for an E2 as far as I know. E2 requires full time employment.   Getting a student visa is about the only thing possible there. However, if he's making his money back home he's still on the hook for American taxes. He may not save that much more."
korea,3e2kv3,I_PROMISE,3,Tue Jul 21 14:20:37 2015 UTC,"300 million is pretty insane, but understandable.  D10's are a lot easier than you think, I acquired 2 before (not in a row). It seems to depend more on the immigration center though. Getting one at Incheon's immigration was super easy and suggested by them, but getting one in Seoul was a little more difficult and had to be constantly justified.  I've met people who teach 6 hours a week and are on sponsorship for an E2, so it's not impossible. Sure, you might need to work a few more hours to begin with, but you can always scale back if you REALLY want to come to Korea and work self-employed.  Despite paying taxes in America (he needs to still pay them if he lives in America you'know), the cost of living in Korea is significantly lower, so of course he'll save more."
korea,3e2kv3,crossmr,3,Tue Jul 21 14:29:26 2015 UTC,"That depends on where he is from in the US and where he is living. If he's living in his parent's house, no it isn't. While some things are cheaper here, especially if you've been here long term and saved up some deposit to get a cheaper rent, a good number of things aren't that much cheaper.   As far as the E2 goes, you're suggesting he take a full time contract then violate his visa status by cutting his hours down, assuming his employer even goes for that. Beyond several avenues of unavailable visa fraud, do you have any real suggestions?"
korea,3e2kv3,I_PROMISE,4,Tue Jul 21 14:37:20 2015 UTC,"You're splitting hairs.  Whether hes living with his parents or not, in Korea he wont be living with his parents. With a similar comparison, aka he is not living with his parents in Korea, so hes not living with them in America, with a similar quality of living, he will save more in Korea. Rent is cheaper, food is cheaper, utilities are cheaper.   I never suggested he took a full time contract, so don't put words into my mouth. Kindergarten morning jobs normally are 10 hours a week, 2 hours a day, with E2 sponsorship available. Scaling back as in, 3 times a week, 2 hours a day, I've met people who successfully have E2 visas this way before. But don't expect much cash from this gig.   Also those who are so high and mighty and purposely pointing out that anything anyone does for cash outside of their teaching job are violating their visa are usually the people who are teaching privates on the side. If you think the government are going to come after you for doing something outside of teaching, you're delusional. The only way you're ever going to get into trouble is if you go around bragging about it. Let me guess, EYK didn't monetize their YouTube videos for the past 4-5 years they were teaching in Korea?   FYI, I don't think your suggestion of investing $500,000 into a property is any better than mine. Investing into property outside of Seoul actually seems like a pretty terrible investment idea, despite obtaining a visa."
korea,3e2kv3,crossmr,3,Tue Jul 21 14:48:25 2015 UTC,"I've never seen a 2 hour a day visa sponsorship for an E2. These days anything I've seen for an E-2 that involves kindergarten is like 9:30-6pm.   Plain kindergartens aren't even allowed to sponsor E2s, they're not even supposed to have outside classes before 1 pm. There are only around 200-250 ""English"" kindergartens in the whole country, which are actually just hagwons. They all require full time schedules for an E2.   working outside his sojourn status isn't an issue since he's being paid in America. Trying to work 6 hour a week on an E-2 is the visa violation. Last I read an E-2 requires a contract with over 20 or 25 hours a weke on it.   Lying to get a D10 is a visa violation. Lying to get a D8 is a visa violation.   At least my suggestion was legal. The student visa you suggested is a solid possibility, but that's it.   Rent may or may not be cheaper. Rent might be cheaper than New York. But if he's living in butt fuck nowhere Utah, it's probably not cheaper. Food is not cheaper. Some cheaper restaurants are cheaper. Certain individual food items are cheaper, a lot of food items (like staples, you know meat, vegetables and fruit) are more expensive."

Elementary Korean skills (i.e. TOPIK level 1) make living in Korea much easier.  You can communicate virtually anything that you'd ever really need to.  Advanced Korean skills (TOPIK 5 + 6) open some employment doors (some of which may not be that desirable).  But in between those levels, the only real benefit is dating.

Just avoid Chuseok (Korean Thanksgiving) if possible; it's a major holiday where everyone stays with their families, things close and the roads get jammed up.  On the plus side, you have free reign of the empty city on Chuseok.  But there are also lots of other things in Fall, you can find them on the Korea tourism site.  The food is good in Fall as you get lots of pumpkins and sweet potatoes and apples etc.  Pretty damn humid. Don't know much about Florida. But it's 83% right now, and that's typical.  The problem with rain in Korean summer is that it often doesn't bring much relief.  I'm usually sweating under that umbrella.   But, if you don't mind it, that's cool.

Maybe Emma Stone has always had an interest in Korea, and due to the long take nature of Birdman, it was her idea to add the Kimchi line into the movie.

As an example, last fall we went to Seoraksan National Park (Bus to Sokcho coincidentally). This was on peak foliage weekend, so a popular one too.  Me and a friend met at the bus station at 10pm (he works late) hopped on a bus within 40 mins, arrived in Sokcho at 12 and split a motel room that was literally across the road from the bus station.  Next morning just asked where to get a bus to the park, and we were on a public transport bus into the park within 15 mins of leaving the motel.

korea,3dv5t7,casper129q,10,Sun Jul 19 19:55:10 2015 UTC,"Long story short, you can't.   Korea doesn't allow dual citizenship when you're naturalizing as a Korean citizen, unless you (1) are married to a Korean citizen and got your citizenship that way, (2) are like a super genius or some otherwise really important person the government thinks they need, or (3) fall under some other obscure category outlined HERE.  Otherwise, once you become a Korean citizen, they give you a certain period of time to relinquish your US citizenship. This means you are considered a foreigner by the US government and every time you want to visit, you need to go through the visa (or visa waiver) process like every other Korean. If you don't prove that you gave up US citizenship, Korea will just say ""nope, you're not actually a citizen.""  You probably don't have to serve in the military because there's an exemption for naturalized Korean citizens.  EDIT: I made the assumption that OP doesn't fall under any of those exemption categories. He/she very well may in which case my ""you can't"" is inaccurate."

I believe Iran is one of those countries.   These English laws mention Koreans can get dual if they get their spouses citizenship and notify the embassy within 6 months of doing so. Previously someone had mentioned that that was only if the nationality was ""automatic"" and not if they did so willingly, this page doesn't mention that, so I'm not 100% on that one."

korea,3dv5t7,Joemaloneyjoe,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:07:41 2015 UTC,"I think the confusion is due to the fact that for South Korean citizens who take another country's citizenship, they are not allowed dual citizenship. As soon as they take another citizenship, their South Korean citizenship is cancelled.  That's what happened to short track skater Ahn Hyun Soo who thought he could take Russian citizenship (to skate for Russia), and thought he could keep his South Korean citizenship.  Instead, his South Korean citizenship was cancelled.  However, this is not the case when non Korean ethnic, non-Korean nationality applies for South Korean citizenship. In that case, all the points I mentioned, applies. They are able to keep their original nationality when they get South Korean nationality. And they do not need to serve in the Korean military either (which I think is a bit unfair).   This is in Korean.  http://www.imagazinekorea.com/daily/dailyView.asp?no=1300"

In terms of law, if you take the dual nationality, and as long as you live in Korea, you will be considered a Korean, not an American."

However, though I was registered as a citizen in both countries, I didn't have a Korean social number until a few years ago. I had to register for one during the process of entering the Korean Army.  If you're a Korean-American who was born to Korean (in the sense of citizenship) parents and are willing to go and get your ass handed to you for 2 years in the Army, then yeah it's easy to hold dual citizenship.  If you're white and have no discernible skills? Probably a zero percent chance."

korea,3dtxi4,MySeoulCalledLife,4,Sun Jul 19 13:01:27 2015 UTC,"Don't even threaten to just do it. Contact the labor board, get your money, and move on. I had to go through this same thing. Hagwon didn't pay me for 2 months, or any of my pension or the money they owed for completing a contract. It took 4 months or so but I finally got my money."
korea,3dtxi4,jeanpetit,33,Mon Jul 20 01:47:37 2015 UTC,"Don't forget that it isn't your problem she's having financial difficulties.  Personally,  you can care about that,  but professionally,  you should be utterly unsympathetic.   Speak to the labor board for advice (very easy,  they have good English speakers) but initially I would try to stay as civil as possible.  Use the classic ""please understand our situation""  back on them,  tell her that you are living on the other side of the world and you're about to run out of money, and won't be able to eat.   I would advise giving an ultimatum,  ie if you don't get payed in x days,  you won't come into work,  but be polite yet very firm  when you give it. That might seem extreme but you don't want to be in the situation where you keep working,  and the pay is further and further behind.   R.e what do do at the end of the contract,  when you don't have the ""I won't work if you don't pay me""  ultimatum,  again ask the labor board for what do if and when that happens . It will be easier if you stay in the country but I don't know if that is your plan.   Be civil but ruthless basically,  would be my advice. If someone owned me wages they could go into serious debt in order to pay me for all I'd care,  as an employee (I might feel bad on a personal level but I wouldn't let that stop me. That's a risk you take if you want to run /have a business)"

Countless times I've seen this happen where it gets later and later until the owner shuts down the school and you're shit out of luck. Also, how will you be owed 10m when you're getting paid 1.7 (which is absurdly low in most situations). I suggest you look for jobs immediately, threaten to stop working immediately, and do go to the labor board asap."

Amazingly, I got paid... and then quit on the spot (wasn't an E-2 at that point, so I had the flexibility to just walk away)."
korea,3dtxi4,doesnotlikecricket,3,Sun Jul 19 14:05:57 2015 UTC,"I think OP means the total of two severances at once. And I assume 1.7 is jugs the amount owed for part of a wage,  not a whole one."

Actually my boss told me that as of two years ago, he is required to put in cash monthly to a severance account in my name to prevent this kinda thing (or his ability to fire me on the 11th month). If your boss has been going about it legally, you should still have this and pension safe.

I've been in this situation before, and it's the only thing that seems to work.   Immigration won't deport you because your employer wouldn't pay you, so don't worry. Also, scout around the office for the contact info for the students families. Worse case, you can threaten to text message blast them with why you won't be at school (I didn't do this, but a friend did).   As with all work, it's your right to withhold it if you're not being paid. Do that, and she'll make paying you a priority.   Quick question: are you two the only foreign staff?"

Tell the boss as soon as you arrive that you will teach no classes until you are paid. Then sit down somewhere (not in a classroom, in teacher area if you have it). Dont teach any classes until the boss transfers all the remaining money into your account. Be firm. The students will know you are on campus but you are not teaching them.

He went to the labor board and was told that since he is still being paid something each month, then they can't do anything. His boss also wouldn't give him a letter of release for him to apply somewhere else. Quitting would mean he can't apply to other jobs in Korea. I hope this situation isn't the same for you but keep it in mind."
korea,3dtxi4,Paramdungi,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:34:59 2015 UTC,I'd suggest going to a labor advocate at that point.
korea,3dtxi4,cockalert,3,Sun Jul 19 15:55:29 2015 UTC,"To add to what /u/Meowhall said, if you threaten to not show up for work because of not getting paid, and then you don't show up, they can file your resignation (or at least they can threaten with that, which happened in my case). In that case you might be forced to leave the country in only a couple of weeks. Things will be that much more difficult for you.  It's typically not a good idea to put your boss in a corner. You can file a complaint with the labor board, and after they investigate I believe you can complain to immigration. You can also file a civil suit, but you have to get a decent lawyer and that can be expensive.  I was in almost exactly the same situation...the first 2 months of payment and the flight reimbursement were fine, but I was never compensated for my apartment. Payment was late every month after the first 2, and the same excuse, ""The school is having a hard time, we can't pay you now, we promise to pay you later..."" was used consistently, as well as the promise that it would never happen again. It was total bullshit.  I ended up quitting 3 months early and leaving the country (going for a Master's this fall, so at least something going on). I tried, for 6 months, to be accommodating and to understand my school's position. They wouldn't agree to release me, but they couldn't afford to pay me. I'm here in America still waiting on 3 months pay and 9 months of housing stipend, and I finished working at the end of May.  Maybe this was my mistake, which I don't know yet, but I cancelled the labor board case. My boss straight up told the labor officer he couldn't pay, the labor officer himself told me I'd have a better chance of getting paid if I dropped the criminal case and filed a civil suit, which is what I did. I lawyered up, but it takes a long time. My lawyer said cases like that can take a year or more.  In any case, I would strongly advise you to air your grievances only anonymously or through official channels (government/legal offices). If the school finds out you've been complaining to co-teachers or students about the situation, and it affects the school negatively, you could be in trouble for defamation. It sounds ridiculous, but Korea has a ""fact or fiction"" kind of law that says any remark you make that damages someone/organization's reputation is defamation. So if you say something like, ""I'm not sure about this school's future. They can't pay me,"" it could be used against you. Be careful!"
