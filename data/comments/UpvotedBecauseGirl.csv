UpvotedBecauseGirl,3d587e,robotortoise,2,Tue Jul 14 06:22:08 2015 UTC,"You do know she wore this in public and OP is standing right next to her while taking the picture.  Don't you think she realized he was with the intention that he was going to show people?  Isn't she literally auto-consenting being in public, where taking pictures is probably going to happen?  Don't you think she may have done this for attention?  Which may lead to a picture?  You literally don't have an argument here, you're saying it's rude someone took a picture and posted it online.  She wanted people to see this, otherwise she literally would not have worn it.  When a girl shows her boobs, she wants people to look.  Girls don't wear push up bras and low cut tops because they're comfortable.  Also, the side of a tit is not her privates, it's a side boob.  I've seen more boob than this in Whole Foods on a Monday after kids soccer practice.  Hell, half the women at my gym wear thong-like booty shorts for some reason with very visible camel toe.  They want the attention.  If they didn't, they would dress more conservatively.  If I whip my dick out in public, I'm doing it because I want people to see, I want attention.  If I don't wear a shirt and show off my abs, I want girls to look at me.  I want them to take my picture or think I'm attractive.  That's why I did it in the first place. There are entire sexual fetishists that get off on people seeing them half or completely naked."
UpvotedBecauseGirl,3d587e,that-freakin-guy,-2,Tue Jul 14 06:42:29 2015 UTC,"I mean....I guess.  It just seems like ""she wanted attention/people looking at her"" doesn't equal ""she's cool with me taking her photo and posting it online to a random site.""  But what do I know? I'm just some guy..."
UpvotedBecauseGirl,3d587e,robotortoise,3,Tue Jul 14 07:05:10 2015 UTC,"The guy is standing a foot away from her, she more than likely knew he was taking a picture.  Seriously, think about it.  And what is he going to do with it, cherish it forever?  Don't you think she was like, ""hey might show this to some people.""  Lastly, there isn't one identifying thing in this pictures besides maybe a tattoo, and even then this girl isn't revealing anything.  This isn't revenge porn.  We can also assume that she dressed like this on purpose, and she likely has similarly styled pictures on her Facebook.  So it's different if she posts them, but she cannot assume that someone else might post them?  Girls live in an age where people save entire summer bathing suit albums from Facebook onto their hard drives, assuming naively that your public person won't ever be used on the internet is asinine.  All I'm saying is she's probably thought about all this, and she probably did so before she even left her house that morning.  You could take this to court and probably make a case, but the judge will say that she went out in public like this, it can be assumed that her image can be used online so long as it isn't in a malicious way, and this certainly wasn't malicious.  I mean, I'd love for someone who's a 2L or 3L to chime in and let me know what they think, but making a case for this would be impossible, so I'd be willing to wager that there is nothing wrong with it."

The fact that people think this is appealing to me, or that one of my hobbies is associated with this, or that I'm just attracted to a cheap pair of tits and a bare midriff, well, is offensive.

UpvotedBecauseGirl,3ajvpj,Andythrax,6,Sat Jun 20 22:29:48 2015 UTC,I guess perhaps I thought this sub was something different. I thought it was used to call out shameless posts which invoke women's overt sexuality to sensationalize the post. Lately it seems like any time a woman is photographed it shows up on here.  What is the deal with this post? You all realize that women have faces and that sometimes those faces will periodically show up in a post? Was it more appropriate that she put on a burka so as not to offend your delicate sensibilities?  I'm out. This sub is getting ridiculous.

This is the highest voted post about the women's team on the whole of /r/Gunners. This is simply because she is an attractive woman, nothing else, there's no context to it.

UpvotedBecauseGirl,3abt32,Brobi_WanKenobi,6,Fri Jun 19 12:19:30 2015 UTC,But anytime a picture is posted with attractive women in it it can only mean that they are trying to get attention because  that is what all females do always.  /s

I don't do things to look cute, I've been a fan all of my life, I'm probably a bigger fan than a majority of the people on reddit. I went to Japan because Inlove anime and videogames. It just happened that my trip fell on my birthday and I took advantage of the moment to get my special birthday pokemon. I went twice during the 10 days I was there. I'm a true pokemon fan to the bottom of my heart. I've been made fun of all my life for it, bullied, even lost friendships because people thought I was immature. I would never go through all of that just so people on the Internet would think I'm cute. You are no psychologist, you don't know me, you just don't know how to take a joke."

Especially when it comes to females. It is as if being a female means that anything you do is automatically a vie for attention.   I would also like to express to you how thoroughly jealous I am of you and your special birthday pokemon.
