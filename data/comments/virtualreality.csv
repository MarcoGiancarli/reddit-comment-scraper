In fact Janus has had a recent influx of users after a Let's player recently highlighted JanusVR.  During peak times (day time in the US) you will currently see anywhere from 10 - 30 users online.  Outside of our virtual reality bubble.  I would say that JanusVR has had the most attention of any social VR platform to date.

But you have to understand that the VR community can not survive with unaccountable posting - especially after the attacks and trolling we have seen.  The Oculus Developers Forum has imploded as a number of troll attacks were not stamped on effectively by OVR and many of the regulars left. It was suggested that these attacks were linked to ""managing of the forum"" to address contesting voices. Others like to point out the FB obsession with ""Dark PR"".  Attempts to update the MTBS3D structure to a ""accountable"" structure with the ITA Forum have met with little publicity and some personal attack for trying to create a ""gated community"" - which seems unfair, and possibly orchestrated.  The question has to be asked - post Q2 2016 - will these forums still attract the level of interest seen, or could they also fall victim to the reality of VR post consumer release?"

virtualreality,3dv3q2,Ericshelpdesk,6,Mon Jul 20 11:09:25 2015 UTC,better if the processing hardware can run anything at that res other than movies.

Some relationships define cheating in different ways. But cheating itself, in my opinion, can simply be boiled down to betraying the others trust. It's just what constitutes as a betrayal happens to be universally agreed upon by most couples, but irregularities exist more often than one would expect. Simply put, if you're not willing to make certain sacrifices for a person, don't be in a relationship with that person."

Content creators will develop for whichever platform best supports their intended purpose or has the widest install base. For example take two original content/distribution platforms WEVR and Vrse - the former has produced high end conceptual experiences on the Vive while the former also produces cinematic experiences but in addition to documentary style content. Vrse doesn't even support the desktop HMD, their aim is wide distribution. Two superficially similar creators are delivering the opposite product. I think you're going to see a variety of VR applications with a range of scopes not seen in games or movies irrelevant of hardware."

virtualreality,3dsvpu,Koure,3,Sun Jul 19 08:32:02 2015 UTC,"Absolutely! Like others have already said, I'm most psyched about interactive, cohabitated virtual spaces. Say you and your friends have plans to go see a movie. But someone gets a cold, has no clean pants, or someone's self driving car has a virus that forces the destination to always be rerouted to the nearest sex shop. Everyone stays home instead, and puts on their gear, porting their avatars into a localized, digital space, similar to the Metaverse in Snow Crash to see the movie there.  Or, even better, being able to spend what seems and feels like physical face time with friends from other countries. Live in the US? Go with your Australian friend on a VR gondolier tour of Venice with an AI guide that responds to questions on the fly, rather than just being a pre-recorded history lesson.  Or even better still, consider the integration of VR and AR! Your friend is at the art gallery in another state, and wants to show you a piece there that he thinks you'll like. He sees on his HUD, be it integrated with contact lenses or simply glasses, that you're online, and currently in VR space. After accepting his request, you begin to see exactly what he's seeing, and he walks you through the gallery to look at the painting.  Or the integration of VR with drone technology! Live streaming from a drone feed, doing a flyover of the Rockies. Or smaller, personal drones that stream footage while flying at head level. Go for a walk with your overseas friend while they head down to the corner store, and chat with them through the drone.  Okay, so obviously I'm getting ahead of myself here, but I'm really excited about the extensive applications of VR for the consumer, far and away from video games. Of course, it'll be fun living in the greaves or self lacing boots of a medieval knight or futuristic space marine, but that's only the tip of the iceberg."

virtualreality,3dsvpu,OgcJvcKmd,2,Sun Jul 19 14:25:54 2015 UTC,"Yes, pretty much. Even with regular games the best moments for me are those where the game just gets out of the way and lets you do things on your own instead of chasing an objective marker. With virtual reality that gets even more amplified as ""looking around"" is no longer bound to the limits of a mouse or analog stick.  That said, I do expect virtual reality to turn out as a bit of a disappointment in that area, as while looking around works fine in VR, touching and interaction does not. It's not even a problem of the VR technology itself, but a constraint of the data you work with.  Take a VR book shelves, even a highly detailed 3D scan of a book shelve won't be able to capture the content of the books itself. So the action of grabbing a book and looking into it won't work in VR. Somebody can of course go in, take the book shelve and fill it with properly readable virtual books, but very few virtual locations that you'll be able to experience will be modeled with that level of detail, most will just be surface scans.  One potential solution to this would be something along the lines of Minecraft. The game is very simplified compared to the real world, but by doing so everything you see can be made interactive. There are no fake objects in the world that are 'look-only', all the blocks can be manipulated. So maybe I'll end up spending most of my time in VR in that kind of toy box experiences instead of 3D scans of real world places.  Will be interesting to see where the journey goes, virtual reality is still in it's infancy when it comes to actual content."
virtualreality,3dsvpu,grumbel,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:11:41 2015 UTC,"Absolutely!  I have no interest whatsoever in games.  It is cinematic and experiential VR that will coax the dollars out of my pocket.  I think we comprise the vast majority of the potential market.  My dad, and most folks over 50, will be way more interested in walking along the Great Wall of China than in whack-a-mole or shoot-a-beast.

Develope intuitive gameplay without facing the borders of the current hardware development. Ergo, skip 20 years of established game designs and start from scratch. ;-)"

virtualreality,3dt5y8,vrgamerdude,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:19:09 2015 UTC,"So, I came across Serious Sam 3 BFE and decided what the hell, let's try this one in VORPX. Much to my surprise It worked almost immediately. After poking around in the settings I found that the game offers a FOV slider that goes all the way to the magic 120!!! After a few tweaks to the game settings I loaded it up and proceeded to be blown away by just how good this one is. I would say that this game is as close to native VR support as it gets using VORPX. The head tracking is spot on, and the graphics look great. there is a small issue I haven't nailed down yet with a weird effect when my character gets hit by something, but it is minor. I highly recommend this game to anyone who has VORPX and a DK2!! This has been the most fun in an FPS game I've had in a long time []-)"

virtualreality,3duvcp,Lorandre,0,Mon Jul 20 21:01:30 2015 UTC,"Hey Hunter, author of the piece here. I don't think it is in any way outlandish to think that this technology will have an effect on the election.   Candidates for years have been using the latest available technology to their advantage in the political sphere. As I wrote, social and big data were hugely important to the elections before. VR gives a whole new medium for candidates to utilize in the political sphere. Advanced, new analytics that are enabled by VR will be used to help guide campaigns. It likely won't have as big an impact this year as big data did with the last election, but it is silly to think that politicians won't utilize the medium that is likely to be all over the mainstream consciousness that year? Candidates wishing to appear innovative and cutting edge will turn to VR in multiple different ways, and as we shift as a society into the new medium it's impact will only increase in election cycles to follow.   In this all is the potential for danger, with propaganda - not as much on the direct political front because I doubt the general American public would stand for that, but from dangerous hate/terrorist organizations like ISIS. It is a cause for real concern, because VR can be such a powerfully empathetic medium.  The bright side is also apparent for similar reasons. Calls to action on important issues that affect the world, like climate change, may become all the more powerful within the immersive medium.   VR isn't a buzzword for the future, it is quite likely the future. It is important to begin thinking about the ways it will impact society beyond how it is going to entertain us."

virtualreality,3dgwwu,22vortex22,8,Thu Jul 16 04:30:56 2015 UTC,"So I just tried this on myself. A few AA batteries, a couple of aligator clip wires, some aluminum foil, some pads made of paper towels soaked in salt water. Wire it up to the mastoid process, directly behind each ear.  It really, really, really feels like you're tipping over. Direction is dependent on current direction, as evidenced by just swapping the electrodes. Obviously, since these were batteries, this was a DC current. Sensation grew stronger over time until it saturated, sort of like a capacitor charging.  No ideas yet what a PWM signal would do, or what higher current at lower voltage would do. I tried both 9v and 6v. 9v was a little bit of a shock, but 6v felt fine. Wikipedia says skin is at least 300 ohms of impedance and about 5mA DC is the threshold for perception of current, so I'm guessing I wasn't able to make a very good contact, because 9v over 300 ohms should be 30mA, which should have been fairly painful.  The sensation was only left-right. I'm assuming that is because the current was flowing over the only one axis of the semicircular canals. Any ideas on how to get it to flow other directions?

virtualreality,3dgwwu,Orpheon7,2,Sat Jul 18 00:47:45 2015 UTC,"So I just tried something like this myself, without results. Can you share exactly what your electrodes looked like and how you placed them, as well as how large they were?  I had a bunch of TENS electrodes lying around, so I used those with an Arduino, which should be able to deliver a bit of current at 5V. It did tingle, particularly when done without resistor, but no special tipping or anything beyond what electricity feels like anywhere on the body.  As to your question, I'm not sure but you could probably engineer some wacky thing with TMS, since you can sort of pinpoint influence things with properly shaped coils. I'm afraid of DIY'ing with that, though; too high currents that can easily kill you. Would something maybe be possible with an electrode in the inside of the mouth, right at the jaw joint?  Also, random additional tidbit that may be useful: You can smooth PWM into more wave-like oscillations rather than the usual square by adding a capacitator, allowing you to do some more waveforms than just square with digital PWM."
virtualreality,3dgwwu,moron4hire,3,Fri Jul 17 19:53:18 2015 UTC,"Well, I actually blogged about it earlier today, so you can see all of my photos here: https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/i-just-hacked-my-brain-sean-mcbeth  I'm not terribly surprised the Arduino didn't work out, for a few reasons. First, the Arduino's digital IO pins actually only run at 3.3v, with a max current of 40mA. The things I've read have said that skin is ""at least 300 ohms impedance"", so the best you can probably hope for, if you're well-hydrated and have a good connection, is probably 10mA.  Second, it's difficult to get a good electrical contact. I'm using just salt water, but it should be a gel. If you're just testing out hand-held, you can just push the smooth edge of the back of the alligator clips into the mastoid process. Make sure you clean behind your ears first. It's an easy place for dead skin to collect.  Third, the mastoid process is small. You've really got to hunt it out. Probably larger electrodes would help here.  10mA should be enough, according to the one clinical trial I link to in my blog, but I doubt it's going to be easy to get that high from 3.3v and home-made connections.  I'm sure, if you hand-wind some coils, you can control the amount of current from the induction coils quite easily. The greater concern is probably heat. I've burnt a number of coils right off of their plastic substrate from some of the circuits I've built (long time ago).  I know about the capacitor ""trick"", done it lots of times.

virtualreality,3dgwwu,ThaMassAppeal,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:11:41 2015 UTC,"This is strange, then, because most of these issues were ones I thought I had dealt with.  I didn't use the 3.3V digital pins, instead using the 5V power pin also on the Arduino. In principle, it should be able to deliver well above 20mA, which is the limit I've ever seen used in tDCS (or does this require higher current?).  The electrodes were quite large (5cm x 5cm squares) with professional conductive adhesive gel coating, so I don't see the problem there either.  Cleaning may have been an issue, I'll look into it. Thanks. Does sweat hinder or help conductivity?  With the mastoid process, we're talking about the bone, here, right? (just to clear any possible misunderstanding)  Does current need to be sent right through it, or under it, or.. in theory?  I'm a bit worried that using too large electrodes ""dilutes"" the current over a large area and reduces effect. Is this possible or is it a misconception?  Thanks for the warning about heat, although I am still iffy about making circuits with potential kiloamperes involved.  The pictures on your blog were quite helpful, and your design of electrodes ingenious. I'll try again another day, hopefully with more success."
virtualreality,3dgwwu,moron4hire,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:59:05 2015 UTC,"OK, 5v should definitely be enough. But you won't get anywhere near the full output of that pin. Pretty sure it's whatever your power supply pushes, not just 20mA, which is at least 200mA if you're powering over USB (could be higher, a lot of computers break the spec to let you run more peripherals on a hub), as much as 1000mA if you're using common cellphone chargers. But they are constant voltage, and the resistance of your skin is two high to get that high. A really good connection will get you 15mA. Just simple Ohm's Law.  Sweat, as long as it is still wet, would help. Dry and it will be mostly lipids and salt, which will insulate.  Those electrodes do sound large. Mine were a centimeter square. I think you might be right about current density. This picture was a second test and it wasn't as easy as my first. My first were smaller still, probably half a centimeter to a side, buy I hadn't taken photos so I had to do it again.  I just ran a test. Both cathode and anode need to be connected to the mastoid directly. It can't just be one on and one off (which I was hoping it would, in which case I would have made both anodes and put the cathode at the nape of the neck, but that doesn't look like it will work now.) It needs to be at the ""knob"" end of it, where it peaks. Look at the Wikipedia page for help on locating it. I tried a number of spots around with a 9v and bare alligator clips, and it was only a small fingertip of an area that was sensitive.  It's a pretty small spot, the mastoid. Find the point where your jaw meets your skull. There is a V-shaped divot where the two meet. That part of your skull is the mastoid process. For me, it's directly behind my ear lobe, but I don't know if different people's read lives can be in different places. Pressing my ear lobe flat against my neck, I touch the mastoid through it."

He basically turned that whole anti-exclusivity discussion to his advantage like the spin doctor he is.  But the facts remain the same, this is a fight over platform ownership and Facebook is using the same console war tactics to win that have never been part of PC space before.  Facebook knows that they have no chance to compete with Steam and open HMD competition if they allow it to develop, so they are pulling Apple's on us, closing off, luring people in and controlling the whole process."
virtualreality,3d9hq7,santsi,2,Wed Jul 15 01:32:10 2015 UTC,I think you're right that Facebook is explicitly trying to close down the ecosystem for those reasons. They are doing this now because they know Vive is going to beat them to market by several months. They're trying to lock titles down so people don't buy Vive. It's disgusting. Where is the FTC when you need them?  Oculus has shot themselves in their own foot and are trying to stem the bleeding by shooting everyone else in the liver.

For AR, there are certain capabilities each device has so that SOME AR apps will only work on SOME AR headsets... but that'll be the exception, not the norm.   While our dev fund is, obviously, much smaller than Oculus's, the only requirement we place on devs that get the grants is that they ALSO build for us, not that they ONLY build for us."

Amazing epic ones, but still peripherals (at least this gen, Moore's Law will obviously have an impact here).  If you're in support of game dev, you should allow the dev to choose the business model/distribution model that best supports them. Ultimately what's good for VR is good for Oculus, but for some reason they're taking a Facebook/Apple approach and trying to create walled gardens instead of trying to promote the industry as a whole.  And by ""for some reason"", I mean because they are trying to stomp out the rest of the industry in every way imaginable (including their upcoming monster CES booths we just saw the floorplans for)."

virtualreality,3d9hq7,moron4hire,0,Tue Jul 14 19:54:33 2015 UTC,"The reason for app stores in AR/VR is pretty strong: otherwise you're going to your laptop/desktop to buy, then ""load"" the app onto the device. An app store should provide a seamless experience (free, paid, freemium) for a user to ""tap an app"", install it seamlessly, then open and run it.  It's also a bunch of free marketing for devs, so they don't need to pay to acquire every user, the store can do a lot of it for them - especially in the early days when there are only so many apps."
virtualreality,3d9hq7,netmobs,5,Tue Jul 14 19:57:39 2015 UTC,"The only reason there is no such seamless experience outside of app stores on mobile devices is because the stakeholders have explicitly resisted. There is nothing about the tech that would prevent it.  I think the arguments that app stores provide marketing and curate for quality are largely specious. The vast majority of app developers will make less than $500 in the entire life of the project. Apps usually only make it to the front page after they've already had a spike in popularity, leaving marketing actually in the hands of the developers.

Going around spreading money for developers to not release their games on SteamVR.    Why would they pay developers to make games for their competitors? If I'm paying someone to make a game, I'd want it to be for my product. If the paycheck the devs are getting is signed Luckey, and not Gaben, why would it go on Steam?

virtualreality,3d9hq7,netmobs,2,Wed Jul 15 03:34:14 2015 UTC,"I see this as more of a looser sort of 3rd party relationship companies had/have. Rare was a Nintendo company untiil MS bought and ruined them. Square made games for Nintendo until the N64.  Even just taking it as funded/partially funded exclusives, I don't see it as much of an issue.  Look at Bayonetta 2 for example, it would never have been made, but it recieved funding and was put on the WiiU exclusively because of that funding. Of course it had some controversy from Bayonetta fans who were salty because they either didn't have or didn't want a WiiU, but it wouldn't have been made without the support it got. If that support means it's exclusivity, it still means it's getting made.  People are getting money to make the games they want to make. Why would the person giving them the money NOT want it to be exclusive to their product. They are quite invested in their product's success.  If the devs thought they could do it on their own without the support they could, or if other platforms wanted to lend a hand they could have done so, and still can. If they make their agreements non-exclusive it could gain some good will, but I'm a fan of exclusives.  I understand consumers want ALL THE GAMES! But I feel having differences in software make for a more varied and interesting field. I fondly remember the Genesis and SNES, where there were far more exclusives, and it was mainly licenced games that were multiplat, and they were usually very different games. Not ""Same game for all systems. Not taking advantage of any of their unique features. Everything's been dumbed down to the lowest common denominator for all ports."" At best mutliplat games for the WiiU have a map or a menu on the gamepad.  I can understand the difference. Games aren't as realistically social. When we were in the 16 bit generation, if I wanted to play Sonic I'd walk up the hill to my friends house, and he'd come to my place to play Mario. I'm not exactly going to go to a friends house to play the Vive and have him come over to play the Rift. It just doesn't work that way, and VR is far more of a sinlge person experience, outside of online gaming. you immerse yourself. There's no room for splitscreen multiplayer really. You can take turns with the screen mirrored on the PC, or I assume on the PS4 when Morpheus comes out, but it's still different."

virtualreality,3d9hq7,netmobs,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:52:43 2015 UTC,"The market decides what strategy will succeed. Oculus could not risk lots of money developing titles for all platforms because this would reduce sales of the Rift which reduces their revenue and then reduces what they can reinvest in their business model.   In the long term Oculus should open up on the hardware side, if they don't then like android/iphone they won't be able to compete with cheaper headsets.  Whether they will keep funding exclusives depends on whether it brings enough extra revenue to offset the costs. Its about out competing everyone else."
virtualreality,3d9hq7,SpontaneousDisorder,0,Tue Jul 14 19:40:54 2015 UTC,I'll say what I said in the /r/Oculus thread. When Oculus showed up they were the first with a HMD and made a API to develop for it. Then companies get funded BY Oculus to start making games. They do so using the only API available. Then a year or two into development a competing HMD is announced with a new API that supports Oculus that isn't as good as the one already being used.   Now there are people saying Oculus and the companies they funded should drop everything they have been doing and invest money in using a API made by a competitor that they don't control to improve the launch of HTC's hardware. It's crazy. Eventually there should be and will be a open API for HMD's because the tech is ready but vilifying Oculus for not jumping on board with guaranteeing that games they payed for will make it to Vive is surreal.
virtualreality,3d9hq7,XenoLive,7,Wed Jul 15 07:26:08 2015 UTC,"No, people are saying that Oculus knew these competitors were coming even before they sold to Facebook (Palmer tried ours 3 days before the sale, and it was very much on par with their internal builds at the time).  The choice to fund these as exclusives vs in partnership, the choice to not release a platform-agnostic SDK, the choice to lock devs in vs simply require for them to also build for Oculus... These are all choices designed to increase Lockin.  The argument that they didn't know what we were building and the 2-3 others at the time isn't just specious, it's a falsehood (not on purpose on your part I'm sure, part of the Oculus mythos is that Oculus was sooooooo far ahead that it'd take years for anyone to catch up).  The quality of device that'll come out between Q4 of this year and Q1 of next year will all be on part with the Rift. And what's best for users and devs is absolutely greater choice, not greater lock-in. Nevermind whatever Oculus will charge for their app store (which everyone assumes will be 30%... so they funded a game only to make it back in transactions AND in headsets sold... yay for double dipping!)."
virtualreality,3d9hq7,netmobs,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:29:28 2015 UTC,"Engineer here. Unfortunately the effort required to support multiple platforms in the present climate is worse than you expected. It is not as simple as ""using a cross-platform API"", especially when viable APIs do not currently exist. In an ideal world it would be here, but it isn't.   the choice to not release a platform-agnostic SDK   Unfortunately the onus is on Valve in this case for releasing an incompatible SDK. It is entirely possible for Valve to have created an SDK which would have been API-compatible to the Oculus SDK but they chose not to do so. This is a reasonable engineering decision by Valve but you cannot possibly blame Oculus for this. I am unfamiliar with possible patents that would have prevented reimplementation of technology but that is a possible consideration. (My knowledge of modern VR is theoretical rather than practical, unfortunately I am not in a good position to dive into the field again this time myself.)   the choice to lock devs in vs simply require for them to also build for Oculus   VR currently nessitates optimization to a single platform. As technology advances, this will become less of a problem. This is because each HMD has different characteristics and quality testing is a huge deal in VR. For simpler demos optimizations are not necessary, but if you're pushing the limits of your hardware one stack is not replaceable with another.  This is simply the state of things. Yes, the execs are probably happy that things are this way but I for one do not wish for another 1997 VRML fiasco to happen."

Visitors hoping for a first person 3D videogame find they have no hands or 3D inputs and can look around and at best point with their gaze.  The core interactive value VPL offered with the Dataglove is missing.  Pantomime solves that using the devices everyone is already carrying.  This will be clearer when our VR integrated apps are available.  We're working with leading HMD makers."
virtualreality,3ct626,DavidALevitt,1 point,Sat Jul 11 21:33:19 2015 UTC,"Pantomime supports many different types of devices playing together in the same virtual world. It doesn't require expensive early adopter hardware like Oculus, CastAR, etc, but you can use it together with those devices to enhance the experience, and also include muggles with phones and pads in the same virtual reality experiences.   Pantomime makes your own pad or phone into a general purpose VR input device, enabling fast and smooth six degrees of freedom navigation by Walking, Waving, Skating and Spinning.   But of course you can't see your own pad or phone's beautiful retina screen while you're wearing an HMD... However: Pantomime also works wonderfully as a virtual window or mirror to enable OTHER people not wearing HMDs to see INTO your VR world!  Shared Pantomime virtual worlds enable VR early adopters to play together with muggles who already own inexpensive pads, smartphones, desktops or laptops, but who haven't yet made the investment and jumped into VR yet.   VR Early Adopters can show off and evangelize their amazing magical virtual worlds and devices to VR Muggles by using Pantomime both as an integrated Virtual Reality Input Controller and Real Life Output Window."

MS has done an AWESOME job making you think the FOV is larger by using 3rd person post-rendering.  It's insanely good tech (my team has tried it), but the FOV is very, very distracting/disconcerting as it either cuts off objects at roughly nose level/eyebrow level OR it doesnt' even render objects you can't fully see (up to dev, as far as I understand).  Either way, it'll be rough, but it is only first gen. The real challenge will be things like ""skype calls that follow you around"", when you have to look up/right to see the skype bubble (or it covers a significant amount of your FOV if it's fixed to the top-right of the viewable window).  MagicLeap will have it's issues. Utlimately, anything AR is about making choices/compromises these days, and every manufacturer (us included) has to make the choices we feel best suit our end users... Which is challenging when we're having to guess at our users' needs and use cases.  Ultimately devs will create the experiences which drive those use cases, and it'll take years to figure out the right balance."

You generally only mess with c++ in Unreal if:   You need to modify the engine source. You're scripting something so complex that blueprints are too slow or unwieldy to do it   Unity has c#, which is trivial to learn if you understand c++. Basically, in your case I wouldn't choose solely based on language.  Unity has more flexibility up-front, whereas Unreal is way more powerful out-of-the-box and has IMHO a much nicer UI. Either engine is fine, really; just comes down to personal preference."

I think in a few years there will be the job ""metaverse designer"" as the next evolution of the web designer. And most of them will probably be using engines like Unity/UE4 and export to wasm.  But I think this sentence is a bit misleading:   “Wasm” for short, is a new binary syntax for low-level safe code, which will run alongside asm.js for the time being. This will further improve the performance of JavaScript applications running within the browser.   As far as I understood, eventually you wont need JavaScript at all. You should be able to compile your application directly from C++/Rust/etc. to wasm."

It basically replaces asm.js and thus JavaScript.  And yes, if you want to (I do) you can also get rid of C/C++ in your code.

If that’s what a heterosexual woman sees when she has sex – a mess of veins and anger and dumbly moronic facial expressions, uselessly bobbing up and down three inches from your face – then it’s perfectly understandable for them to hate men. By the end of it, I pretty much hated men as well.   Because a man can act dominant for a porn scene, it's justified for women to hate men? I guarantee he wouldn't say the same for some male POV femdom.  Not to mention the total disregard for the possibility that he, as a presumably straight cis-male, has no place to be the judge of what women who have sex with men should find attractive?

I've been That Guy Ecotourist. I've seen first-hand what even the most well-meaning people can do to a fragile ecosystem. VR is going to keep clumsy, forgetful, lazy, annoying people out of the places that need the most care.  And it's going to bring more people to them--virtually. Right now, places like the Galapagos Islands or the Antarctic are fantasies for all but the richest 2-3% of the world. If you think that sounds like an absurdly small number, I don't think you realize how poor most of the world is [0].

virtualreality,3cehur,dhatereki,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:33:56 2015 UTC,No hardware requirements since tridef is software based solution. It simply provides 3d side by side images for you so you just need to stream through nvidia or native trinus streamer (with false3d disabled of course). I'm using a nexus 5 and the nvidia results are just amazing. Tricky to set up at times though.

The term is typically used when addressing education policy and curriculum choices in schools to improve competitiveness in science and technology development. It has implications for workforce development, national security concerns and immigration policy.  The acronym arose in common use shortly after an interagency meeting on science education held at the National Science Foundation chaired by the then NSF director Rita Colwell. A director from the Office of Science division of Workforce Development for Teachers and Scientists suggested the change from the older acronym SMET to STEM. Dr. Colwell, expressing some dislike for the older acronym, responded by suggesting NSF to institute the change.

Then, you'd need some environment to have the Lighthouse emitters, and all of a sudden, your phone would become super accurate in its translation and orientation sensing.  To answer your question another way, Google has already experimented in Project Tango with ways to do tracking without Lighthouse emitters...  There's a camera like a Kinect 2 on it, and also just normal cameras with motion-tracking.  The motion-tracking is dang good.  I don't know that it's good enough for VR, but it's definitely good enough for some impressive and fun AR."

But if you are going top of the line to cutting edge it's going to cost you anywhere from 2000-3000, totally inflated I'll admit, but that's PC hardware.   If you're going to get an Oculus Rift, the likely purpose will be for gaming, unless you have spare cash laying around and just want it to have it and/or movies and the virtual desktop or simple games.

virtualreality,3c2poj,nihilist-ego,2,Sat Jul 4 17:01:51 2015 UTC,"The mouse controls are similar!  I made this quick write-up on them:  Super TLDR: No Mouse Button Pressed = FPS Control,  Hold LMB = Arm Control,  Hold RMB = Defensive Arm Control  Hold LMB+RMB = Full extension Arm Control  Tap MMB = Move arm to customizable keyframe position  TL: For mouse and keyboard, you control it normally like any FPS, but if you hold LMB, you have complete control of the arm. I think stopping turning when striking is more realistic to simulate planting your foot, but you can toggle circling to ""Lock on"" to an opponent so turning is handled is automatically - this can make you predictable though and your opponent will know you are mindlessly turning whichever way he wants you to.  With Muscle Memory, you can control just the shoulder, and use pre-programmed/customizable movements for all the other joints. For example, you might enable ""Two handed Weapon"" muscle memory, then when you move the shoulder the arm knows how the forearm and wrist should be oriented based on the location of the arm (winding up, mid attack, follow through, overhead, etc.). You can switch muscle memory on the fly - If you hold RMB, you move your arm in a defensive way, or if you hold LMB+RMB it's a maximum extension swing. You can override any joint at any time though if you want to make some fine tuning - mouse wheel will rotate all the joints in the arm at once, or you can hold down different keys to focus on one joint (4th mouse button or 5th mouse button if you want).  Lastly, you can just pre-program shoulder ""coordinates"" into the system, and toggle through these by pressing MMB instead of using the free control. This would be just like toggling through keyframes in an procedural animation - though you can freely switch back to full control at any time. I used this to throw the axe in trailer video because it was hard to execute a throw while controlling my character from that angle."

The top HMD makers are going to treat VR like game consoles first because they're part of a well understood, profitable market. That means targeting home use. 2. The cost will come down. 3. We can't run out of physical space until we have powerful, fully un-tethered hardware. I don't see that happening for at least a few years.

I see the attraction, but I still can't see arcades coming back simply from the shift in society that home computing has brought us. Back in the day, you got out of the house and went to the mall because there was nothing to do. Now, if I stay home, I can still get entertainment from my Wii, Netflix, PS4, Steam, Reddit, Facebook, etc. You went to the theatre because you couldn't get that level of quality at home, now you've got TVs with higher resolutions than some theatre projectors. I can invite my friends over to enjoy the theatre without crowds, sticky floors, or bad seats. I can do the same with video games now, even more so, with VR and the internet, I may share a personal experience with someone from across the world while feeling like we're in the same room.  Plus, it seems that all of these companies are specifically targeting home-use, so I don't see the ability to provide anything better in an arcade.

Timing and kinematics of article  Saccade:       Saccades are one of the fastest movements produced by the human body (blinks may reach even higher peak velocities). The peak angular speed of the eye during a saccade reaches up to 900°/s in humans; in some monkeys, peak speed can reach 1000°/s. Saccades to an unexpected stimulus normally take about 200 milliseconds (ms) to initiate, and then last from about 20–200 ms, depending on their amplitude (20–30 ms is typical in language reading). Under certain laboratory circumstances, the latency of, or reaction time to, saccade production can be cut nearly in half (express saccades). These saccades are generated by a neuronal mechanism that bypasses time-consuming circuits and activates the eye muscles more directly.   Specific pre-target oscillatory (alpha rhythms) and transient activities occurring in posterior-lateral parietal cortex and occipital cortex also characterise express saccades.

This is the first (to the best of my knowledge) truly universal quality phone VR headset. You have the google cardboard which is cool but really more of a gimmick than a HMD. There's the Gear VR that's really awesome but only works with one phone and then there's the Zeiss VR One which supports multiple phones but not all phones (you have to have a sort of plastic mold made for your phone to keep it in the correct position).  This is cheaper than the Zeiss VR (~$70 as opposed to 129 euros ($144)), fits all phones up to the nexus 6, is really comfortable and although you can't see it, the front is semi-transparent to allow pass through from the phone's camera. It also comes with a nice case.  Yes it is limited by how good the sensors on the phones are but then again you can use it with pretty much any phone. If you're interested in just a personal cinema experience that's comfortable or a demo unit to show off VR to friends and family this is a really good tool.

I'll admit it's not particularly a looker and if you have a fashion sense (I don't) it might inhibit you from using it in public.   I will be using it at more of an enthusiast level than a regular consumer level so I don't really care how ugly it is, i'm more interested in how functional it is.  If you're really interested in consumer quality, defiantely hold out for the Gen 2 gear VR. Supposedly the Note 5 is going to have a 4K screen and it makes no sense to put such a high rez display in a phone unless you want to use it for VR as well. 770dpi? I don't think you'll be able to distinguish the pixels on such a display even with a regular magnifying glass.   I'm really excited for the Gen 2 Gear VR and will probably get it if the phone indeed has a 4K display."

I'll admit that the cushioning could be improved on the type I have, but it fits my nexus 6, and could adjust down to fit an iphone 4 as well i believe as well. There are a lot like this online, just curious if there's any real difference since you mentioned that the this was , to your knowledge, the first truly universal quality phone vr headset. was the emphasis there on ""quality"" rather than ""truly universal?"

There is quite the differance as I have one of those as well but you are correct I was putting an emphasis on quality over truly universal. While what you have is rather uncomfortable to ware, especially for more than 20 minutes at a time, functional wise there's nothing wrong with it. As you said it fits pretty much any phone and it allows for IPD and focus adjustment per eye.  I'm going to write a long review about what makes the XG VR better than a one of those (As objectively as I can) and will post it on reddit when it's done. I hope to get it done today :)"

I'm interested to hear the differences though aside from the obvious comfort factor . I've been trying to decide if buying a better one would be worth it or if I should just get the Rift when it comes out and stop playing VR stuff on my phone"

I really want 1st person games, racing, flying and space sims, but because they can make some people sick many devs regard these as ""no go's""  I've been on boats since before I was born, was an elite gymnast, have spent years sitting in a closed tin-box (aluminium but who cares) being ""driven"" through crazy hard terrain and I've been a gunner on a MBT (Leopard 2). Not once in my life have I experienced motion sickness, I think I've experienced the beginning of sim-sickness once with my DK2 but then I went to the bathroom to pee and either that was the break I needed or I really just had to pee badly and probably should have gone to bed hours earlier.  What I'm trying to say is; I'd hate to lose out on great experiences because it could induce sim-sickness in some/most people and for devs not trying to push the limits (that could even help some people to grow their VR-legs) would ruin some of my big hopes for VR.  I know profitability is required when making software and sim-sickness is a major problem to some, but sometimes I'm allowed to be selfish and (sort of) unreasonable and when it comes to VR, it's one of those times. ;-)"

virtualreality,3bkcmu,kukabuksilaks,1 point,Tue Jun 30 10:42:58 2015 UTC,ED simulates an environment you're not evolved to cope with. There is no horizon and little that would make you feel acceleration.  In other situations you can hit puketown hard and fast with little warning if you are engrossed. It's super easy to trigger. You can literally be fine right up till you're yanking the headset off.

virtualreality,3bfr7g,agamemnon42,10,Tue Jun 30 03:39:14 2015 UTC,"Not much is official yet, but HTC collaborates with Valve (makers of Steam), so it's reasonable to assume games are going to be a major target for them.  Here's a quote from their website:   Vive is powered by Valve’s SteamVR so plenty of games that take advantage of its capabilities will soon be available on the Steam service.   Oculus, on the other hand, is now a subsidiary of Facebook.  At the time of the acquisition, Facebook's statements of what they envisioned getting out of it seemed primarily focused on virtual meetings/chatrooms/hangouts, although there was plenty of vagueness.  IIRC there have been one or two announcements of game companies developing for the Rift, and I'm sure there will be some games on it.  So, it seems like HTC is aiming primarily at gaming, while Oculus will be aimed partially at social media and partially at gaming.  Many of the other applications will be aimed not at consumers, but at various professions, there are proposals for using VR for training in areas from military to medical, and there will definitely be things like remote surgeries being done with VR.  Getting back to consumer applications, pick anything you use the internet for and imagine it in VR.  News reports will place you in the middle of the subject, you'll never book a hotel without taking a quick virtual tour of it, and TV and movies will be gradually replaced by their VR equivalents."
virtualreality,3bfr7g,anlumo,13,Sun Jun 28 22:07:47 2015 UTC,"Palmer Luckey (founder of Oculus) has stated many times that he sees games as the first stepping stone for VR, with social experiences following later. CV1 will definitely be designed/marketed for games, just like the Vive."
virtualreality,3bfr7g,mptp,5,Sun Jun 28 23:54:56 2015 UTC,"This would be a good answer if you'd posted it 9 months ago, shortly after the acquisition. What Zuckerberg said back then was:   But this is just the start. After games, we're going to make Oculus a platform for many other experiences. Imagine enjoying a court side seat at a game, studying in a classroom of students and teachers all over the world or consulting with a doctor face-to-face -- just by putting on goggles in your home.  This is really a new communication platform. By feeling truly present, you can share unbounded spaces and experiences with the people in your life. Imagine sharing not just moments with your friends online, but entire experiences and adventures.   However, every single piece of marketing and information coming out of Oculus (except for a brief period where they were talking about 'cinematic experiences') has been that they are focused on gaming. This may well be in part due to the very game-focussed competition of HTC-Valve Perhaps long-term Oculus is going to transition to more social stuff. For now, however, they recognize that the majority of VR early-adopters are going to be people interested in video games, so that's where they are focusing for the first generation Rift. Their recent press conference was basically entirely devoted to VR launch titles - all games.  Ultimately, it's hard to say what each headset will be used for. These are literally the first consumer headsets ever to be released in scale. Who knows what they'll be used for? Sure, games for the near future, but in 2017 and beyond? Nobody knows for sure."
virtualreality,3bfr7g,brackstone,1 point,Sun Jun 28 23:56:55 2015 UTC,"Agreed  Everything is up in the air right now. We do know the that HTC Vive is being developed with Valve so it will have a games oriented focus to help drive sales of games on steam etc.  The Oculus I'm sure will try to support games, the question will be how much games will support the oculus back.  I'm look at VR Headsets basically as monitors. If they are created in the consumers interest they will just show you what you want to see. So hopefully the Oculus will work with whatever the Vive works with."
virtualreality,3bfr7g,KingNeal,1 point,Mon Jun 29 01:04:34 2015 UTC,You quote Mark's implication that they will be focusing on gaming first. Then you express skepticism of that quote because their marketing is focusing on gaming first. I'm not sure I see the incongruity you're seeing.
virtualreality,3bfr7g,mptp,1 point,Tue Jun 30 07:03:58 2015 UTC,I didn't quote Palmer...  I quoted Mark talking about social experiences back in 2013 to contrast it to Oculus' current game-focussed marketing strategy.
virtualreality,3bfr7g,KingNeal,1 point,Tue Jun 30 22:00:41 2015 UTC,"Sorry, fixed.  Regardless, Mark did say ""after games"", which indicated that their first focus would be games. So I'm not sure why you interpret Oculus's game-focused marketing strategy as a contrast to what Mark said.  It's nothing to be remotely concerned about; general experiences will be huge in virtual reality and will comprise an audience much larger than just gamers. But let's face it, all the Oculus Rift early adopters will be gamers, so that's the only audience worth pandering to right now."
virtualreality,3bfr7g,mptp,1 point,Tue Jun 30 22:20:02 2015 UTC,"You make a good point - he did say 'after games'. I always interpreted that as him making sure he didn't anger the 30,000-ish Oculus Rift owners at the time by not mentioning gaming at all. He definitely focused more on the other aspects.  But I'm not concerned - I'm in VR for the long haul. Whatever VR is in the next few years will be more or less irrelevant in 10 or 20 years. If marketing towards gamers ensures the fastest adoption, then that's what I'll get behind.  That being said, my work involves non-gaming applications of VR, so I might be a little biased. ;)"

virtualreality,3bfr7g,mptp,1 point,Wed Jul 1 00:24:17 2015 UTC,"Oh definitely - VR is going to be more than a gaming technology in the same way that realtime 3D graphics (which really got 'mainstream' due to games) are way more than a gaming technology.  I follow VR input pretty closely, and I don't see any good solution to infinite first-person VR locomotion coming any time soon.

The guns really move like someone is grabbing them, and the head movement is equally sharp.   I do not feel this crispness in movement in the videos of any other system. In the Morpheus videos, there is a definite lethargic feel to all movement. Same with Oculus.   I don't know if it is the way the videos are recorded, or if the actual VR experience is really that different. If it is, then definitely the Vive is way ahead of everything else."

Basically projecting images directly onto the retina.  Microvision is currently focused on PicoP display technology (laser based projectors integrated into phones) but they hold a ton of patents on VRD and I can't imagine Magic Leap being able to bypass those patents.  I watched the entire linked presentation and they basically said absolutely nothing.  I want this to succeed, but right now I'm imagining something more along the lines of a limited FoV Hololens type device.

HoloLens et al. (and Rift et al.) only have a single focal plane.  In that sense, the imagery generated by Magic Leap is indeed somewhat more natural than what the others can present.  Of course, only if you believe anything they're saying."

virtualreality,3b6mjw,theGizmoDen,0,Fri Jun 26 11:54:05 2015 UTC,cardboard is not really VR its more just a 3D viewfinder.
virtualreality,3b6mjw,gamermusclevideos,2,Fri Jun 26 11:57:07 2015 UTC,"I invite you to take a look at /r/GoogleCardboard to see that Cardboard is indeed VR. Google considers it ""bite-sized VR"", as the slow sampling rate of phone gyros and lacking optimizations in stock Android cause it to unsuitable for many users as full blown VR HMD, making shorter experiences the safer option. It is deliberately designed to be hand-held to prevent fast head rotation, which could cause nausea in users more sensitive to lag, but there are enough users of Cardboard software that use Cardboard with modifications or viewers with higher FoV as low end VR HMDs to place it clearly in the VR corner. Technical constraints of the current generation of smartphones will keep Cardboard in the low end section of VR, but is is most certainly not just a 3D viewfinder, with more to come from the AndroidVR OS project.  And while Google guessed that 1M Cardboards have been sold up to Google I/O 2015 in late May, the download counter for the Cardboard demo app had already passed the 1M mark at the beginning of February, so there are very likely a lot more Cardboards out there, making it the largest VR platform by far. The recent addition of stereoscopic 3D video in the Android YouTube app (instead of ""later this year"", as the article claims) caused a big rush of interest in Cardboard for easily consumable 360° videos on YouTube. So these numbers will only grow faster, partly driven by the increasing use of Cardboard for promotion, e.g. for Conan or Terminator Genesis."
virtualreality,3b6mjw,faduci,1 point,Fri Jun 26 17:12:54 2015 UTC,"Depends how you are going to define VR   If you are going to use the benchmark set by consumer rift and vive then it's not , if you are going to go by 1990s definition of VR or a 3D view with some head tracking then sure.   All the popular and best applications of cardboard are precisely 3D view finder apps , which is fine and I can see why they are very popular and will gorw in popularity. but there is a defined difference between that and made for VR HMS's or phone holders that are well designed and add additional performance or tracking like the GearVR."
virtualreality,3b6mjw,gamermusclevideos,2,Fri Jun 26 19:23:52 2015 UTC,"but there is a defined difference   I agree with you that the Rift and Gear VR are playing in another league. Where I don't agree is that there is a ""defined difference"". It is actually a pretty arbitrary difference. Before Oculus/Samsung came out with the Gear VR, pretty much everybody agreed that VR required a fast PC, a last gen graphics card and at least 75Hz, 90Hz would be better. Then Oculus said it would also work on a phone with a CPU/GPU capable of handling about 1/100th the draw calls of the current desktop GPUs and without positional tracking at 60Hz. The DK1 is considered a VR HMD, but pretty much any 1080p phone in Cardboard will look better (not necessarily feel better) due to the higher resolution. On 1440p phones most no longer recognize any screen door effect, party due to the lower FoV in Cardboard.  The only absolute condition for VR I'd accept is a sufficiently high FoV, because this is required for immersion. What number this means is up for debate, as there isn't even a clear definition how to measure FoV, but for me personally there is a very simple test: my stomach. I am afraid of heights, and of course this happens in VR too. It is not particularly desirable  trait, but very useful for testing immersion.   The first time I experienced this was in The Height. I started building DIY Cardboards immediately after Google I/O 2014, initially with some 3x magnifying glasses, until I finally got the lenses recommended by Google. The Height was developed for the Durovis Dive, a phone based VR viewer preceding Cardboard and features, well, heights. This did nothing to me with the lower FoV provided by the magnifying glasses, but the first time I looked down from a high platform with a sufficiently large FoV, my stomach immediately cramped.  This wasn't expected, as I had stood at the same place before, just using different lenses. Since then I have modified a number of 3D viewers that were clearly intended for watching movies, not VR. These are sold cheap on ebay and Amazon and usually feature a focal length of about 75mm, resulting in an FoV of about 55°, compared to 80° on a 5"" phone in Cardboard. The effect is always the same:   low FoV: ""Ah, a cliff, wonder what will happen if I jump down. Okay, I'm dead."" high FoV: ""OH SHIT OH SHIT OH SHIT, go back!""   This is a completely instinctive reaction. I've had to jump down a high ledge in 4Rooms (one of my standard test apps) dozens of times over the last year to catch a key, and I never get used to it with a decently high FoV, my heart always starts racing and I have to approach the ledge very slowly.  Otherwise I'm one of the lucky persons who can stomach pretty much everything in VR: miserable frame rates, low resolution, picture getting stuck, having camera control taken away, even glitches that make the image jump around. I do a lot of experimentation with high and low end phones, and the only factor that really counts for me is FoV. Fast phone, high resolution, low magnification: it doesn't feel real. Very old phone, 720p resolution, 15fps, high magnification: my brain switches to panic mode.  This is certainly not the average case. I've seen people feel sick for half an hour after trying a demo for five minutes, so every optimization that Oculus added to Android for Gear VR is important and at least for a part of the users even essential. Brendan Iribe, the CEO of Oculus VR, is one of the persons who are very sensitive and said that the Crescent Bay prototype of the Oculus Rift was the first one that he could actually use for more than a few minutes.  So if there could be any ""defined difference"" indicating a) what a VR device is and b) what a usable VR device is, I'd say a) everything that feels real (as in immersion, not as in presence) and b) everything that you can comfortably use for a longer stretch of time. These definitions obviously depend on the individual and the exact use case. For some a USD 1.56 Cardboard with USD 0.79 head straps and a used USD 45 Samsung Galaxy S II from ebay will be a usable VR device. For a few unlucky ones not even the Oculus Rift CV1 will be sufficient, so it makes little sense to define a DK1 as VR and a Note 4 in Cardboard 2.0 as a 3D view finder.   The biggest advantage of Gear VR is currently the 20ms motion-to-photon latency, compared to about 50ms in the DK1 and about 80ms on a Nexus 5 with Cardboard. This makes a huge difference to people sensitive to lag, and hardly any difference to someone who isn't. The other performance improvements are nice to keep a constant high frame rate with good graphics, but this again depends on sensitivity and most Cardboard apps are designed with much lower graphics performance in mind to achieve 60fps. Less pretty, but it works too. There is nothing absolutely necessary for everybody that could ultimately distinguish Gear VR as VR and Cardboard as not VR. And most of the GearVR improvements are expected to appear in the AndroidVR version too, blurring the difference even more. So even if you pick an arbitrary set of specs today which allows you to introduce a separation, this will be obsolete within a year."

Despite Minecraft not being the ideal game for VR (too much player motion), I figured this could help boost early adoption of VR, and back then Oculus Rift felt very much like a enthusiast project that I wanted to support (and did, by pledging the max amount on the kickstarter).  In the middle of talks, after having me invited over, they completely blindsided me with suddenly belonging to one of the companies out there that cares the least about its users.  In the months after that, I calmed down and realized it's all just business, and then eventually went on to sell my own company.

virtualreality,3b3gqw,xNotch,12,Thu Jun 25 23:12:15 2015 UTC,"Despite Minecraft not being the ideal game for VR   To me Minecraft seems a perfect fit for VR if you scale it down and turn it into a third-person perspective ""god game,"" and especially if you give the player the option to scale dynamically. That way you can move around wildly and build at toy scale, which doesn't cause motion problems, and then seamlessy zoom into first-person perspective to admire your creation at 1:1 scale without moving too much during that time. That navigation paradigm (""drag&scale"") has been working very well in our VR application."

It's unclear whether the positional tracking will work with that (probably not, although it should be possible I think).  If you're using it wired it's worse than Vive or Rift.  I'd imagine the only reason you'd want to buy this is if you want both the mobile and non-mobile VR experience without having to buy both the GearVR and a Vive/Rift. Otherwise just getting one of those would be a lot better."

I do think it will be worse than Vive/Rift due to the specs being worse.   It might have an edge on the mobile side since it will have a lot of horsepower, but GearVR will have the upper hand on content. Unless you can maybe get the GearVR content over to Gameface? I doubt Oculus would allow that, but it would be great. Can you comment on using Lighthouse while untethered?"
virtualreality,3aw96a,AwesomeFama,2,Mon Jun 29 06:25:14 2015 UTC,"We already have a bunch of content that is on GearVR however we have a wider fov and much high graphical fidelity than the note 4 or s6. Bomb squad in particular is a beautiful example of just how much more horse power we have when compared to other mobile VR. While GearVR allows for low and medium graphics levels we have enabled high and highest, while still keeping a smooth frame rate. I would strongly suggest trying it out as and when you're in London SF or LA."
virtualreality,3aw96a,gamefacelabs,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:06:27 2015 UTC,Sounds good :) Do the GearVR apps need to be built specifically for Gameface or is it a simple job to transfer them?

virtualreality,3aw96a,gamefacelabs,1 point,Wed Jul 1 20:16:28 2015 UTC,And out of interest. Which specs are worse than the Vive or Rift?
virtualreality,3aw96a,gamefacelabs,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:08:38 2015 UTC,"Refresh rate, weight and price. Granted, we don't know the final weights of any of the three headsets, but it's pretty safe to speculate that a headset + computer + battery will be heavier than just a headset. We don't know the prices either, but the same applies there.  The Rift also has a mic, headphones and mechanical IPD adjustment (although I guess you could manage that with lens adjustments and handling the ""screen adjustment"" in software if you're using one screen?).  Actually, now reading through the Gameface specs, 140 degrees FOV is really impressive. I missed that before. If the 15 Hz difference isn't quite as big of a difference as we've read from reports (a lot of other things have also changed from DK2 -> Crescent Bay) the specs are pretty comparable to the Vive. Especially accounting the camera, although the Vive might have that too?"
virtualreality,3aw96a,AwesomeFama,2,Wed Jul 1 19:48:23 2015 UTC,"Specs sound awesome and the prospect of an untethered room-scale experience is very tempting, but I doubt the experience is anywhere near as good as Oculus/Valve/Morpheus, regarding presence and image quality.

virtualreality,3aw96a,Reddit1990,1 point,Wed Jun 24 18:46:02 2015 UTC,"Yea I should've written that more clearly.  About DK2 - this is all about timing, right? Valve announced (with HTC) that they are working on a headset/input combo too, and the devkits followed soon after, but their schedule is tight, so there is no way they could output thousands of Vives for general public to use. I blame Lighthouse/input mainly here, as those are probably not mass produced, but rather put together manually. They will be ready to mass produce them, but not now (that would take energy they need for the consumer units). Soo, kinda understandable. Not Valve being more closed, but more focused on the release and having a tight schedule."

virtualreality,3au67k,lefnire,4,Tue Jun 23 15:16:03 2015 UTC,"As of now, people say the Vive controllers are like using tools, and the Touch controllers are like having hands. However, this might change.  A developer said that they saw the consumer version of the Vive, and that it looks amazing, beautiful, and way different than what we've already seen. (I can find a source if you really want, although it was part of a podcast and I forget which one, so it'll take some time.)  Now, that sounds like it's probably mainly going to be changes to make the headset more comfortable, and the headset and controllers more aesthetically pleasing (the prototype Vive controllers are ugly as sin). But now that Valve has seen the Oculus Touch, they could certainly take ideas from that and create something better, maybe in time for November, and certainly in time for the actual release of the Touch in Q2 next year.  As for other input, most of them look very promising if they're developed further, but I haven't seen anything that looks like it will be ready for the release of the Vive or the Rift, with the exception of things made for specific tasks, like the Striker rifle which is obviously designed only as a firearm.

I expect a variety of specialized controllers using their tech to come out for specific game types and should be good but limited to their genre of game(Joysticks, steering wheels, guns, etc).  The Locomotion stuff will remain niche for really specific applications and hardcore people with huge budgets.   Haptic stuff seems to be a generation or two away from being good although a accurate haptic glove will do well if invented. If perfected it's the holy grail input but I don't see that happening in the near future.    All the gesture mocap stuff even if really accurate really suffer from the lack of physical substance in my mind. When simulating grabbing something I'd much prefer having a solid controller in my hand like the Oculus Touch than having my hand clench air."

Right now it is still much more effective to play that game with a mouse and keyboard.  I think more advances will need to take place to change this fact when it comes to shooters -- or, a shooter would need to be specifically designed as a VR game, which could be very cool.  Trackmania would be really cool in VR if you could have a first person view and use your VR setup to look around and stuff.  That's actually a really cool thought, Trackmania in VR.  I always thought that if I had to pick a racing game to play in VR, I'd look at simulations and stuff.  But something wild like Trackmania might be amazing.  With VR I think we're going to see entirely new games rise as E-sports, which will be specifically designed to be played in VR, potentially with haptic gloves!

virtualreality,3aqxmx,vreezer,1 point,Tue Jun 23 16:28:26 2015 UTC,"There was apparently a demo that Valve made for their early VR prototypes of a table top style VR viewing mode for DOTA 2. I personally think this would be awesome and would definitely love to try it out.    I don't know how much it will be a driving factor but I think that for mobas and FPSs a top down view of the battlefield where you can ""pan"" and ""zoom"" naturally will be a really engaging experience much akin to the difference between watching a football match from the TV from the pitch side and from a player prospective. Although the TV view is the ""best"" view a lot can be said for the feeling of watching from a stadium.     For a game that will require VR? I think it will become necessary when games start getting truly 3d in their playscapes (think something like blitzball from final fantasy 10.) When you are spectating action in three planes you will need VR. Current games  that would benefit hugely are things like space combat sims. (Elite?)   P.S. Hearthstone is an interesting one. At first I though ""2d game, wouldn't benefit from VR"". But if it is competitive and you have cameras in the play space and suddenly have live action reactions and things with the board rendered in a 3d environment it would be pretty engaging. Necessary? No. Cool and a nice thing to have if you have VR already? Definitely."

virtualreality,3aqu24,alexsavin,1 point,Mon Jun 22 19:38:16 2015 UTC,"Hi - what's the approximate angle of view of the footage you've shot? VR player has a half dome projection setting that might be what you're looking for. It's  $5 on the google play and worth it imo. In that case your work is basically done and it's just a matter of popping your phone into a cardboard headset and testing your existing video clip.  Shot from one angle, your clip is only going to 'wrap' as far as the angle of view of the clip,  which is fairly limiting even with a wide angle GoPro or Yi lens. If you have a stereo timelapse with something closer to 180 degree horizontal fov, then you'll really be in business.  Edit: i watched your London timelaspe film, really nice work. If that's what most of your footage looks like, half dome projection probably isn't the right setting. There's a 'plane' setting that essentially puts your file on a big screen. The 3D effect will be nice,  I'm not sure how much the VR will add though it's worth experimenting. The fov isn't especially wide, so you'll be hitting the edges of your 'screen' with minimal head turning"

To run all the projectors needed the cost and size of the system, as well as the compute power needed must be huge.

virtualreality,3apwxn,ThatRoboticsGuy,2,Mon Jun 22 17:42:21 2015 UTC,"i'd venture multiusers. and image quality.  there would be no pixels and you could increase image quality exponentially without proportionate cost increase. you could add another projector to get something like (a max of) x2 ""pixel"" increase, wihtout upgrading the projectors. and you can upgrade the projectors with less spacial limits than if you have a monitor.  but more importantly for an institution, you can have other people in the room without having to scale much. the image to them will be slightly distorted from perspective but not much. so you can discuss what you observe much like in this talk. it is more social than having a screen plastered to one's face, and there isn't the low & hard limit of ""we only have 4 displays"", without taking up much more space."

It's possible to use these systems for longer, with fewer side effects, in order to get more things done.  Head-mounted VR is getting very close, though.  A second aspect is the ability to have multiple users in the same environment interacting with each other and the visualized data. That's much harder to pull off using HMDs right now."

They can also be much more comfortable to use and are much harder to induce motion sickness with.  The downsides are that they are harder to design applications for:  projectors tend to have contrast issues, walls tend to bleed colors on to each other, projector alignment is finicky.  And, they are pretty expensive in terms of size and materials.  I've also noticed that people tend to treat CAVES like big TVs, both in usage and in application design, and that temptation can be very destructive."
virtualreality,3apwxn,lizaverta,2,Tue Jun 23 19:59:56 2015 UTC,"CAVE is as good as dead.  To be fair, we're not quite at parity yet - CAVE systems are more comfortable for users and easier to get multi-user setups working well. But this time next year, HMD tech will definitely be good enough to make CAVE's irrelevant.  All reports are that the consumer Rift is comfortable enough (ergonomically and VR-wise) to be used for many hours. Facebook is pushing the social aspect of VR very hard, and it's clear that 6DOF input is going to become relatively standard for the next little while with Vive and Oculus both producing solutions for that kind of input.  I feel bad that Brown University will only end up getting 12-24 months of good use out of this system before the technology renders it practically useless."

I doubt they are interested in porting existing games.   As for 'stationary'  experiences,  they've said that the minimum space they are targeting is roughly 6'x4' ('two yoga mats').   From a technical perspective,  Lighthouse is perfectly adequate for tracking a stationary headset,  but Valve doesn't seem to think that's where the future lies.  Edit: cockpit games and theater type environments are an obvious exception."

virtualreality,3alhym,Otakucd,1 point,Sun Jun 21 11:21:21 2015 UTC,"Far as I'm aware (and I run marketing for an HMD company), only a handful of headsets have announced actual specs so far (we haven't). As a result, anything you see today will shift before a single real device is available.  However, a few notes:   Any phone-based headset will suck for gaming (latency), and for movie-watching (PPI/display quality) Every HMD manufacturer fundamentally has to choose between refresh-rate (ideal for gaming), and display (ideal for movies). There are a handful of recent threads where I mention upcoming displays from Tier 1/2/3 vendors, and none that I've seen (which, yes, includes Rift/Vive) is above 90Hz AND 15PPD AND 500 PPI. You end up making choices as a manufacturer, based on what you're trying to build for. We aren't on that list, which is odd given the number of CES awards we won ;)   (note: mostly kidding on #3, here's a more extensive report: http://sophiccapital.com/augmented-reality-glasses-getting-closer-to-reality/ )"
virtualreality,3alhym,netmobs,1 point,Mon Jun 22 02:31:30 2015 UTC,You'll have to wait to see which HMD ends up with the best resolution.

I can see that actually being a modestly reasonable concern. Like if I was to put out a movie-viewing VR program and say ""It's an IMAX experience!"" in the product description or something, that's actually one of the cases that trademark law is meant for.

Anyway, Kickstarter has better traffic and tools, but IG has better network effects and the internal team does work hard to promote key products.  Given, as @callezetter said, current fatigue in the space (127 current HMD's announced?), you can't be middle of the pack. You need to be VERY different, but if you are, raising a few hundred grand in a few weeks is entirely feasible (we watched 3 in May and 2 so far in June hit their targets.... but we say dozens in both month NOT hit their targets).  My only other advice is that PR breeds success. Every single flipping successful VR campaign on either platform this year has had coverage in Tier1 tech press. So, yes, they are raising ""free"" money, but they are also spending it (I'm a marketer, so I'd guess 20-50K ish).  Ultimately, driving crowdfunding requires actual marketing. Awareness, consideration, decision. Yep, great hardware will get you a high percentage of Deciders, but if you don't have enough top of funnel? That'll only mean a failure on your campaign.

virtualreality,3aardu,Kale_Anonymous,4,Fri Jun 19 02:15:32 2015 UTC,The touch won't release until mid 2016. I'm buying the vive because it comes out first and the tracking volume is superior.

virtualreality,3aardu,Tramagust,5,Fri Jun 19 06:38:56 2015 UTC,"Agree, these features took me out:   releasedate you have got to point the tracking camera up to play a standing game and point it down for a sitting game experience (sounds pretty limited, doesn't it?) you can play games, which are facing in one direction, only (with 2 input tracking cameras) you might need up to 4 input tracking cameras for 360° free roaming + a standard tracking camera for the hmd itself (that's not a simple setup)"
virtualreality,3aardu,Tetrisaurus,3,Fri Jun 19 09:08:08 2015 UTC,Just mount the camera high and point it down. You should be good whether you stand or sit then. No adjustment required.  You can definitely get 360 degree tracking with 2 cameras. Just put one in front and one in back. At E3 they had both in front because they wanted journalists yo realize multiple cameras were tracking them. Palmer himself said this in an interview.  Input tracking camera and hmd tracking camera are the same camera. You only need one to track everything. You need at least two to be able to get 360 degree tracking. You definitely don't need 5.
virtualreality,3aardu,Tetrisaurus,1 point,Fri Jun 19 12:09:10 2015 UTC,"Ok, thanks for clarification. What I got from the interviews: They are going to sell the rift with a free standing tracking camera (no wallmounted camera). The hmd supports 360° freedom with one tracking camera. Controllers need at least 2 cameras for 360° roaming and ship with 2 trackingcameras (wallmounted version). At this point you don't need the freestanding camera anymore."
virtualreality,3aardu,Tetrisaurus,1 point,Fri Jun 19 14:09:44 2015 UTC,"Palmer stated the camera will have the quarter-inch (? maybe a different measurement) tripod mount the current dk2 camera has. I haven't heard that the controllers will ship with 2 cameras. As far as I know they haven't given any details about what will ship with the controllers or even what specs/functionality it'll have other than the obvious hand-tracking/finger-tracking. Some people are suggesting it'll have some kind of haptic feedback other than vibration, but they haven't given details.

Why is there this discourse? Why did this fracture occur?  Unfortunately, ""a fracturing of a great community of developers and enthusiasts"" has only really started happening very recently, when Oculus announced several things such as dropping support for Linux and OSX and having exclusives.  The war is not between fans of Oculus and fans of Valve (or HTC). It's (mostly) a ""war"" between people who ideologically care for an open environment and people who don't."
virtualreality,3ab4zl,TheFlyingBastard,5,Thu Jun 18 18:11:46 2015 UTC,"I develop in Linux, with jMonkeyEngine (a BSD-licensed 3D engine) which I'm bringing OpenVR to (so I can support many head mounted displays). I very much agree I'm not happy with Oculus's decisions to drop OSX & Linux support, while announcing many exclusives. However, we can't let that divide us, the consumers. If we stay united & develop content for both headsets & input devices, it will reduce the impact of other exclusive effects.  We don't want to alienate Oculus users, though: they are virtual reality fans too. Instead of blaming them for picking a side, we can keep open for them to be more open with us."
virtualreality,3ab4zl,TheFlyingBastard,8,Thu Jun 18 18:23:10 2015 UTC,"Of course I'm not saying that this fracture can be fixed by blaming or excluding certain consumers from good software.

What we need to do as consumers is band together and make clear that we don't want to take this shit. And there's where the conflict starts. ""Who cares?"" some say. That almost indifferent attitude (and perhaps some related hype?) is what needs to be bridged now that the VR consumer community is still in its early stage. Hence, it's not Rift vs Vive per se. It's the clashing of attitudes."

virtualreality,3ab4zl,5tr2,3,Fri Jun 19 05:16:48 2015 UTC,"I still don't get the thought process behind Oculus buying Hardware-exclusives, the main reasons people seem to come up with is:  Oculus are the only one with gesture input. (So far that's true but that could change and the gesture inputs could be emulated or adopted by others and help create standards for VR)  Oculus would be giving the competition ""money"" by paying for software being developed and not having it as exclusives. (I see this as Oculus limiting their potential profit, instead of making the software as hardware-exclusives they could make it Oculus-home exclusive and make money on other HMD's. This would help usher in the ""VR revolution"", as they have stated was one of their goals, and could make Oculus a big (if not the biggest) player in VR software distribution (=$$$).)  By this I'm not saying that there should be no hardware-exclusives, of course not, I'm lobbying for keeping the amount of hardware-exclusives at a reasonable level so it doesn't hurt the birth of proper consumer VR."

If there's another company beeing able to compete with a product like the Vive, it's a nobrainer which system to choose. Even if it wouldn't be as good, or scores less AAA games from publishers i mostly don't like either.  It would feel so awkward if you're invested in the Oculus ecosystem and FB starts to exploit it in the future. I'd feel guilty of having supported it, knowing what i know at this point in time.

Not because i hate Sony or Facebook, but because i want it to be successful enough so that developers are going to create games for the Vive and i get games to play.  If both Sony and Oculus (and especially Oculus, because they are on PC - an open platform!) would stop pumping money into securing exclusive third party titles and stop creating an artificial rift (heh) in the VR userbase, i think we would alle be much more relaxed, because our purchasing decision wouldn't really matter.

There will be so many HMDs that it will seriously destroy the TV market.   This isn't pepsi Vs coke, this is benq vs lg vs soniq vs sony vs all the other monitor brands.

Oculus, Vive, OSVR and Morpheus also all have low persistence displays, much higher FoV, and positional tracking, which all add immensely to immersion. The biggest factor you're missing, though, is that you played games that weren't meant for VR. If the only way to look around also moves where you aim, it can really mess with immersion. Wait until you try something actually designed for VR on a real HMD before making the final judgement. There's a reason Cardboard is so cheap..."
virtualreality,3abnjf,entropicdrift,6,Thu Jun 18 20:20:54 2015 UTC,"It is just the Google Cardboard.   Oculus DK1 is OK (better than cardboard).   DK2 is enough better to be an interesting consumer experience.  The Note 4 GearVR is an experience worth trying, but still not a product I'd consider buying.  The S6 GearVR is slightly better than the Note 4 but the best thing it has going for it is essentially watching 3d movies. Which isn't a bad thing but not worth the cost of the thing.  The products coming at the end of this year and early next year are impressive (Valve/HTC Vive, Oculus Rift, Sony PS4 Morpheus). There will be games coming (right now there are mostly tech demos and betas available)."
virtualreality,3abnjf,tragicshark,2,Thu Jun 18 20:28:45 2015 UTC,"Apart from low persistence display and better optics, you're missing out on positional tracking. (ie, if you move your head forward or back, the rendered POV doesn't move with you - it's like the world is moving with your head.)    And as note, you really do need an application that's natively designed for VR.  Even with a real VR headset, playing a regular game with hacked-in support (like GTAV with VorpX) is not that great.   Once everything comes together so that your head movements are tracked perfectly, with no latency or drifting, with a display that updates with a very high refresh rate (=>75fps) and low persistence (frames are shown very briefly your brain doesn't register things moving with you a little bit as your head moves,) in a native app with real stereo rendering, then something clicks and it feels like you are just looking around at a real, substantial 3D world.  Cardboard can give you the barest hint of what's possible with VR, but it's not going to be a very compelling experience.  If you're trying to use it with Vireio and stream PC games to it, that's even a poor representation of what Carboard can do.  You say you have a Note 4 - have you had the opportunity to try GearVR?  That's already much better than Cardboard - although it it lacks positional tracking, it checks off a lot more of the boxes necessary for good VR, and will give you a much better idea of what you can do."
