Tim Curry did dark lips and dark eyes for Rocky and pulled it off by balancing it. Not too heavy on the blush - because that would be too clown-like. Just a simple contour, clean brows, and drama at the eyes and lips only.  (Side note: I love Rocky.)"

I think you'd be better off with a solid color dress over a floral print.   If you're at a loss for what makeup to wear, you can always just do a neutral/natural look to be safe. Again, choose colors/tones that complement your complexion, but nothing bright or bold like you're going out clubbing (unless, you know, you're going out clubbing).

Your eye shadow is a great color for you, and I really like the way you did your liner. It was suggested that you do more under liner, but I disagree. You've got a very natural look going here, and I think more liner would change the whole feel of the look. Granted, I am very strongly in favor of a natural look.   Good look, but a few tweaks needed to make it great."

I haven't really used blush before because I get quite red cheeks, which tends to show up after I've been out and about/doing things. Blush that I have tried ends up looking pretty clownish.

Consider trying a different shade.   The blush is a lovely color with your skin tones. I think the application should either be slightly lower if you're going for a contouring look or slightly higher and slightly in towards your nose if you're going for a ""flushed"" blush look.  I love your eye makeup colors, and think the application looks good. I'm not wild about this lipstick but it's just personal preference."

sugarfreemua,3dnmjt,One_of_a_Kind,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:48:42 2015 UTC,I'm by no means an expert! But you could try out a satin or flat finish eye shadow. Test out some of your current shadows (regardless of color) to see if you like how it texturizes and fills in brows - then there are so many colors to pick from: way more than brow products in my experience.
sugarfreemua,3dnmjt,Hopecat,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:01:02 2015 UTC,"The purple undertones is something I have not thought of before. I have red hair (naturally a reddish blonde, but it's currently an ""assisted red"") and the eyebrows can look a little green sometimes. I have previously dyed them using a brown eyelash dye.

I used to use the same MAC coverup a while ago and realized that it really didn't provide me the coverage that I wanted. It's so watery and hard to apply without smearing it around. If you're going to invest in high end, I would recommend trying something a little heavier for trouble spots like NARS creamy concealer (my HG, it's completely bulletproof once set with powder) or Laura Mercier camouflage. I also think that getting your brows thinned out a bit would really open up your face. You have such gorgeous eyes and great eyeshadow application, I think a more trimmed brow wouldn't draw so much attention away from that.   Edit to say that also, a concealer brush changed my life. Applying it with a dabbing motion instead of sweeping with my fingers really improves the coverage you can get without getting cakey."

sugarfreemua,3dfbj4,keeeunjung,0,Thu Jul 16 03:25:06 2015 UTC,"uncle fucker (hehe!) gave some great advice! Just wanted to add I've heard a lot of ppl like the Maybelline Fit Me concealer, it's packaged similarly to Nars (wand, black top). If you have a lot of spots to cover, you might want to try to get your hands on a sample of Estee Lauder Double Wear! A lot of ppl have had success w/ that in covering up their redness. Casey Holmes on YT uses it for her rosacea. But next time you're at a counter or in Sephora see if you can get color matched and try it out, or have them do it for you! I also want that lip color! lol"
sugarfreemua,3dfbj4,unclefuckerImustsay,-1,Fri Jul 17 19:50:44 2015 UTC,"I understand!  I get soooo lazy with getting my hair dyed in the summer because it's too hot to wear down anyway!  I think first and foremost your concealer problem is centered around the one you are using.  It's just not a great product in my opinion.  I looked up the ELF concealer brushes, are you using the one with orange bristles or the one with black bristles?  There are a few things that could be holding you back with these brushes.  First, the black bristled one looks more like an eyeshadow smudger brush.  You really want your concealer brush to be flat and synthetic, so that it won't absorb the product.  Second, the orange bristled one looks very small.  That may cause a problem because you want your concealer brush to be wide and flat to cover as much ground as possible with each swipe.  I usually use my NARS applicator (it's just a doe foot) and tap a few dots in the areas that I intend to cover-up (under eyes, around nose, problem areas) and use a patting motion with my wide, flat brush (I believe mine is Sephora brand) to spread out the concealer and seal with finishing powder (I love Too Faced Primed and Poreless pressed powder because it makes my skin so smooth, but there are a million cheaper options).  I really hope that was helpful!!  Good luck maybe checking out a few new tools and I would love to see an updated look in a new post! :)"

Your under eye area could benefit from a bit more brightening. I really like Hard Candy's Glamoflauge concealer - it's usually about $6-7 at Walmart or on Amazon. It is medium to full coverage, but super easy to blend. Also, the mascara may be fine, but I can't see your upper lashes. Try curling them - even ELF has a lash curler. Or perhaps try a curling mascara. Finally, I can't really see your eyeshadow... maybe you were light handed with those neutral shades? Great start!"

I like your lip colour, it is especially nice paired with your blue hair. I would love to see you wear like...an orange or red lip because I love opposites but you do you. Another cool shade would be something similar to MACs D for Dangerous because it's berry toned, but a bit pinker and fun for a darker summer lip.

I certainly understand why you feel they are a bit lost right now, but I think that's partly to you being not used to how you look right now. With the bright lips and hair, I really think all you need to give your eyes some oomph is tight lining and good mascara."

sugarfreemua,3ctcgf,neodeone,2,Fri Jul 10 18:16:19 2015 UTC,"My suggestions:   All shades should be the same(ish) tone, like all either ""warm"" or ""cool."" Your dark gray shade (which kinda looks even a little green) is more cool while your brown and dark outer shades you blend with are warm. So they create a bit of a clash. Too dark near the inner third of the eye - which makes it look like your lid is mostly all one color with open eyes. Ideally the darker shades should be avoided entirely in the inner third area, and used sparingly (if at all) on the middle third section. Incorporate much more of a lighter shade in the inner and middle third of the lid. Again, these areas look too dark to me, and makes the overall effect more like charcoal than smoke! Extend the lighter colors out further, don't blend the darker colors towards the middle as much. In many styles that I think look good, the lighter middle shades should actually make their own softened ""outer corner""... if that makes any sense. Related to that - Your gradient should be more than just upwards from the lash-line to the brow (which you did pretty good on) but from the inner eye to the outer eye, too. Think lighter near the inner corner and darker towards the outer corner.  To further lighten the inner corner you can use an even brighter, lighter color there - like a light silver or even a near-white shade. That said, because you have hooded lids, you'll want to extend the gradient upwards towards the brow more, because much of the ""crease"" area is entirely hidden when you open your eyes. (Which makes it look like your eyes go straight to dark gray to brown in your open pic) The very darkest shade should actually be used more on the outer crease of your lid than near the lash-line. You blend it out (away from) from the crease but neglect the crease itself and much of the area you should blend it above the outer crease. Only after the crease is darkened should the outer third of the lashline be darkened, and generally it looks bad for the lash-line to be darker or heavier than the outer crease - but it's a common mistake! But try looking at some pictures of well-done smokey eyes - You'll notice that even in the most subtle versions, the shadow near the outer lash-line is never darker or heavier than that of the outer crease! In many subtlier versions, the lash line only has liner on it while the darkest shadow is only on the crease, not the lid or lash-line much or at all. Also, pull your shadows down to your the bottom lash line and recreate a slight gradient there, too! Otherwise the extension on the outer corner looks a little odd."
sugarfreemua,3ctcgf,waitwuh,2,Fri Jul 10 18:53:07 2015 UTC,"A smokey eye, traditionally, starts with the darkest shades closest to the lash line and feature a darker colour across most if not all of the lid with maybe an inner corner highlight. The placement you have suggested is not a smokey eye."
sugarfreemua,3ch2rw,CanelaMorena,5,Tue Jul 7 21:20:52 2015 UTC,"I guess it really depends on where you are interviewing,  but I would echo the brows,  and maybe a less shimmery eye colour but even then it's not distracting. Your skin looks amazing,  but not so made up that I would be paying attention to it and not you. Looks fab !!"
sugarfreemua,3ch2rw,Rayna007,1 point,Tue Jul 7 23:58:22 2015 UTC,I was interviewing at a casino. My brows do look cray though -__-   The blush placement request is in general. I am just not sure where to put it on my face. The more I try to figure it out the more overwhelmed I feel. So yea...
sugarfreemua,3ch2rw,l0l0lol0l0l,3,Wed Jul 8 00:00:56 2015 UTC,"I would try out blush on the apples of your cheeks maybe (like the first example in the link someone else posted), I think that might really suit your face shape. I suggest just trying it out at home at night before you take off your make up, so you have time to play around."
sugarfreemua,3ch2rw,mkguyote,4,Wed Jul 8 00:35:39 2015 UTC,"Agree on that; one good guideline for blush is to apply it no closer to your nose than just below the pupils of your eyes when you're looking forward, no lower than the apples of your cheeks when you smile, and no higher than where your eye sockets start (your under-eye area you'd normally conceal). Other than that, just blend up and out! Have fun!"
sugarfreemua,3ch2rw,CattiePants,9,Wed Jul 8 04:12:42 2015 UTC,"Your skin looks great! You might want to use a bit more blush - I can't see it. But your cheeks would be even more lovely with a bit more color. Your brows are a bit uneven, they don't need to be perfectly symmetrical, but maybe work on evening them out a bit so they are similar widths and similar evenness. Your lips need moisture - keep slathering on the lip balms night and day. The color is pretty - is it your natural lip color? The gold shadow looks nice, but it's a bit one-note for my taste. Maybe work in the Garnet a bit more and add a deeper color too (chocolate brown?) for depth.   Good luck with the interview! :)"
sugarfreemua,3ch2rw,CattiePants,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:20:36 2015 UTC,Thank you. No its not my natural lip color. The Babylips had a reddish tint to it.  I completely agree with my brows. I didn't realize how goofy they looked until I was in the car and on my way -___-  As far as blush. I chickened out on going hard with it because I was so unsure of placement.  I will keep up the practice. I am so happy that you say I did well with my skin. This was my FA with concealer. When I first put it on i was so scared it was gonna be bad.
sugarfreemua,3ch2rw,ladyanneboleyn,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:27:26 2015 UTC,"Practice with more blush and brow product when you get home! You're safe there. :) This looks like a decent blush placement guide (except #4, that's not an everyday look!)."
sugarfreemua,3ch2rw,fireworks_hurricanes,2,Tue Jul 7 22:43:43 2015 UTC,I disagree with your assessment of #4. I think bringing blush up your temples can look quite pretty and natural (naturally a flush can appear as high as the temples).  I wouldn't only wear blush on my temples but I think it can look nice.   Edit: I suck at formatting
sugarfreemua,3ch2rw,Rosewolf,2,Tue Jul 7 23:48:58 2015 UTC,"I LOVE number 4, I'd never thought of doing that but I think it looks great."
sugarfreemua,3ch2rw,theyinhuman,3,Wed Jul 8 10:34:47 2015 UTC,"I'm going to go ahead and disagree with other commenters here. I didn't notice your eyebrows, which means they are okay. And I don't think you should use more blush. The outstanding feature of your face is your eyes, and I think you should exaggerate them with more eyeliner. A cat eye would look great on you. You also have nice teeth and lips, but I'd stick with colors in the range you've chosen and simply play up those gorgeous eyes."
sugarfreemua,3ch2rw,thelacie,3,Wed Jul 8 00:37:15 2015 UTC,I don't have any CC. I just want to say that your lip color is gorgeous.

sugarfreemua,3cbwkg,Liebeistfuralle,6,Mon Jul 6 18:36:24 2015 UTC,"This is very subjective, but I think you look awesome with winged eyeliner. But, I think you want to fill in the inner corners a bit, too, or else too much eyeliner on your outercorners might create the illusion that your eyes are too far apart and make your face look less ""lean"" (like, wider). You could also try shading/contouring below your checkbones to help bring out your bone structure (and prevent the ""wideness"").  A big thing I noticed is that you seem like you might have a problem I have... uneven/unsymetric brows/eyes just enough to be more noticeable (most people are not symmetric, but some people are more or less so than others). I think that's why you can't decide between almond or round - your left eyebrow sits just a little lower than your right and it sets off a cascade of confusion making the two sides of your face look slightly different from each-other. In certain angles (like slightly from the side) this is mitigated, but straight-on it's more noticible, and the ""hood"" over your left eye caused by the the brow sitting slightly lower might be part of the blame of why your eyes seem to have slightly different shapes. You might have some luck trying to groom your eyebrows to bring down the inner-edge of the higher one and up the inner-edge of the lower one - if that makes any sense.  But damn girl, you have model-quality lips!"
sugarfreemua,3cbwkg,waitwuh,2,Mon Jul 6 20:12:29 2015 UTC,"To add onto it, looks like you have really nice cheekbones too, the right placement of blush/contour would look amazing on you. I agree winged liner would look really good on you too."
sugarfreemua,3cbwkg,ShadowCat946,2,Mon Jul 6 20:43:19 2015 UTC,"Your eyes seem almond shaped. I agree with u/waitwuh about the winged liner and the symmetry challenge regarding your eye area. We all have a unique symmetry to our faces, and if we want to create a more perfect rendition of it, we can do so using shadows and light to create that effect! If you experiment with shading and highlighting, you can create the illusion of balance. Shade what you want to appear receded (very common for cheekbones to create the illusion of a more cut cheek, or to make a large forehead seem smaller) and highlight what you want to appear front and center (brightness around the eyes is common). Here's a nice face chart showing basic placements of light and shadow to define the face's natural contours.  People are probably gonna downvote this since ""contouring is dead and strobing is in"", but ""strobing"" is just another method of defining the face's symmetry by focusing solely on highlighting. The face naturally has contours within its framework: use light and shadow to your advantage to work what you've got, or create what isn't there. If you've ever taken a drawing class, the principle is the exact same: using light and shadow to create three dimensional roundness/shape to the subject.    Check out the Shade and Light palettes that Kat Von D makes- I have a lot of respect for her as a player in this industry because she is a professional tattooer, and is thusly a wizard at knowing and honing the concept of drawing and shading. Her face and eye palette with this name are based on the concept of defining the face and eye area. The eye palette is especially wonderful because it has warm, cool and neutral blocks of color within the palette itself, so it can cater to a wide variety of skin tones. As a side tangent, getting a nice matte palette for yourself is going to give you tons of versatility in what you do! You can use it for eyes, face, brows, multiple seasons, daytime or nighttime, etc...Make sure you always stick to mattes when you create shadow, since shadows naturally are not shimmery or shiny and you would thusly be drawing attention to the area!    Contrary to popular belief, a ""shading"" color does not HAVE to be cool-toned. If your skin is cool (i.e. more pink than yellow), then a cool-toned shade is ideal for that skin palette. Take a look at your skin, it will give you natural clues as to your own palette and your tonal family. I learned this at a workshop I attended at a professional makeup tradeshow a few months ago, and it has changed the way I approach contouring on myself and my clients. I have neutral-leaning-warm tones to my skin, and my contouring/shading changed dramatically when I broke free of the hype bubble I'd been in and started contouring with a product that had warmer tones to it. It made the shadows I created/enhanced on my face more natural than the cooler-toned products I'd used before. Just something I thought worth mentioning.  Your lips have a fantastic shape, so perhaps until you get your own shading/highlighting routine down, you can create a focal point on your face by wearing noticeable lip colors to draw immediate attention to that part of your face! If color is a bit much just starting out, try playing with lip stains or tinted glosses to work up your confidence. I can't tell your skin tone too well in the photo, but I'd bet that a nice bright pink, tangerine or even coral color would look lovely on you.    Your brows seem to have somewhat of a natural arch to them. Do you get them shaped or otherwise professionally maintained? Have you heard of the brow mapping technique? This might be a good starting point for you to experiment with your own brows. By creating this little bit of symmetry on our face, we immediately reframe our features. When I do my makeup, I always do my foundation and then brows to even out my face before doing any cheek or eye makeup.    Edited to be more robust with links and stuff."
sugarfreemua,3c1bi6,redlipstick18,12,Fri Jul 3 21:17:17 2015 UTC,"OP do you have any natural brow to work with? From the photo it looks like you do, and I think that you would benefit from VERY lightly outlining your brows with your product and then blending it in from there, and then maybe adding a tiny bit more product to the tails.  Also I'm sensing that you're a little nervous to use the colored shadow that you've chosen. Don't be afraid to pack on the pigment. Is the shadow you're using not very pigmented? If you're wanting to do more colored looks I suggest getting an elf pallete with ALL THE COLORS off of amazon. I have one and it is perfect for playing with color and getting comfortable with using colors.  When I first started experimenting with different shadows I would do my main color in my crease, and then blend a neutral into my lid. This is bare bones advice, but I think it is still worth trying."
sugarfreemua,3c1bi6,VestaDear,13,Sat Jul 4 00:54:21 2015 UTC,"I suggest using a better eye primer, like NYX eyeshadow bases. It doesn't seem like your eye color is showing up well at all.   I would also tone down the brows a lot."
sugarfreemua,3c1bi6,BabyyImaStar,6,Sat Jul 4 00:37:37 2015 UTC,"How bright did you want the eyeshadow to be? I don't think it looks bad, but it seriously looks like a neutral eye. Frankly, I think it could get a little too garish with such a bright lip. If you want your colors to pop more, try applying over a (well blended) layer of NYX Jumbo Pencil in Milk, or another creamy white color.  Your brows are very opaque, I think you could benefit from using a lot less product. Also, as a girl who also has very dark hair- using the exact same shade as your hair to fill in your brows often ends up causing a jarring contrast. Consider using a very cool taupe (suits everyone).   In the close-up photos of your eyes, I can't help but notice how smooth your skin looks. You probably don't have much acne, if you have any at all. If that's the case- I don't think you need to use a tinted moisturizer, and a MAC foundation, and powder, and concealer. Why not just use the tinted moisturizer, concealer, and powder? Your freckles are cute."

But I agree that this is definitely more of a neutral eye. Even though you've used pinkish/mauve shades, it's so sheer that I don't really identify it as a colourful eye. You could always tone down the lips a bit and pack on some more of the colour, enhancing the shadow pigments with a colour base. From what I can tell it is a good colour choice for your skin tone though, so you're on the right track!"
sugarfreemua,3c1bi6,BabyyImaStar,3,Sat Jul 4 13:23:46 2015 UTC,"It might be the quality of the photos, but it's not very noticeable. Like someone else said, it looks neutral-I don't really see any colour, other than your own skin."
sugarfreemua,3bwuja,TericeNatalie,31,Thu Jul 2 20:25:34 2015 UTC,I don't really like the lip color :/ anyway I can here to say that I think your brows need to be a bit thicker in the center instead of the dramatic decrease after the front part.
sugarfreemua,3bwuja,PrincessCate,12,Thu Jul 2 22:03:26 2015 UTC,"I agree with this, particularly the brow. You have such beautiful length, shape and color, it's just too sparse in the middle.

I think Sephora cream lip stain 08 isn't too bad, but it's a bit too light, and there are other pinks which suit you much better.   I personally like pitch, but with the right makeup.

sugarfreemua,3bscct,Nica-sauce-rex,6,Wed Jul 1 19:24:03 2015 UTC,"I think it's an improvement, as subtle as it is you look more sophisticated and your eyes are larger.   You say you're looking for a more dolled up look - what does that mean to you?  This is more of a fresh, naturally healthy look to me, sort of girl next doorish, if that makes any sense.   My version of a more dolled up look on your features would be to increase contrast between colours and features, and to make the skin look more perfect, but less natural.  That is, a heavier coverage foundation so that freckles and such are covered, deeper toned lipstick, and much more defined brows, with false eyelashes."
sugarfreemua,3bscct,P_Grammicus,2,Wed Jul 1 19:45:53 2015 UTC,"Thank you. Up until very recently, the only makeup I ever wore was some eyeliner/ mascara and a little BB cream maybe, so this really feels like a lot of work. I like this look for daytime but I just wasn't sure how to take it any further since, like I said, this is really trying. I'm thinking about getting some dipbrow and falsies to try out. Appreciate the suggestions!"
sugarfreemua,3bscct,Ivegonewrong,2,Wed Jul 1 20:04:46 2015 UTC,A lot of people suggested changing the angle of my eyeliner and/or only lining the top lid both of which really seem to open up my eyes. I also added some highlight to the inside corner.

sugarfreemua,3bscct,Ivegonewrong,2,Wed Jul 1 19:25:57 2015 UTC,"You could try a longer wing and a dark/bright gloss? Plus a paler/thicker foundation.  I would always feel like I was wearing too much makeup because I was used to none, but if I did it only to my comfort level it'd come out far too natural."
sugarfreemua,3bscct,Ivegonewrong,2,Thu Jul 2 07:32:10 2015 UTC,Thank you. Yeah I definitely want a thicker foundation but I'm not sure what to get. I really want to try Kat Von D or the Estée Lauder double wear but unfortunately I don't have access to those brands. Do you have any suggestions for a good full coverage that I could buy at Ulta?
sugarfreemua,3bscct,unfunnypun,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:31:18 2015 UTC,"Sorry, I'm not really sure... as I tend to get the cheaper drugstore brands, also the ones that run paler and cooler in shade and I'm not sure of your skin type.  If it helps I use Rimmel Match Perfection if I ever need proper makeup, and before that I think I had Max Factor Smooth Effect. (Revlon Colorstay is apparently a bit more coverage than that.) Sorry for recommending cheap stuff, just you know. Budget.  Edit: Oh and if you were game to try false lashes, I used to use Ardell 'Sweeties' for clubwear. They make a huge difference while not looking too costumey. You may have to trim one or two lashes from the outer corner of each so they're not overly long for your eyelids."
sugarfreemua,3bscct,nappykin,2,Thu Jul 2 16:37:03 2015 UTC,"Oh no, I'm sure my boyfriend would agree that I should be buying drugstore brands, as well!! Haha. But the general consensus seems that Colorstay is the most full coverage in that price range, which is what I'm currently wearing. I'll check out those lashes, though, thank you."
sugarfreemua,3btpia,something_anon,3,Thu Jul 2 01:51:27 2015 UTC,"I love a thick brow, but I think you could benefit from getting them cleaned up around the edges. I also don't think the amber color should have been carried up to the brows, and would have liked to see some blush to balance out the vibrancy of the lip against your light skin.  When you wear eyeliner, remember to tightline- the gap between the line and your skin messes with the effect.  Lastly, I can't really tell much about your overall coloring from two photos, but you look cool-toned. I think you could pull off the warm shadow better if it were paired with a warmer lip (maybe a coral?) and you had lightly bronzed. Right now, the warm shadow and the cool, pinky-red lip contrast a bit too much for me."
sugarfreemua,3btpia,unfunnypun,2,Sat Jul 4 02:37:03 2015 UTC,"I really dig the simplicity of this look, especially for summer, and the lipcolor is perfect. My only cc would be to blend out your highlight a little more, as from the first picture it looks a bit like a harsher line of product. Other than that, I think this would look really nice with some slightly smoked out liner, maybe using a warm toned brown shadow, just to further play around with the casual summery vibe you have going."
sugarfreemua,3btpia,mostlyqueer,1 point,Thu Jul 2 06:25:03 2015 UTC,"I don't know if I like the warm eyeshadow and the bright lip with this look without having some sort of blush, because my eye is focusing on the colours and then you're sort of getting washed out. I would do the lip with a simple eyeliner no-eyeshadow look or even with no eye makeup at all if you're going for a more minimal look. I agree with blending out the eyeliner a bit more."

I feel the eyes are too defined for the rest of the look and it is a bit mismatched. I'd take off the liner and experiment with the eye makeup more.

There are some very good eyebrow tutorial links on the sidebar in /r/makeupaddiction, very worth looking up. Currently your brows don't look like anything was done to them, but I think that's a matter of definition rather than the colour you've chosen.   Second the eyelash curler."
sugarfreemua,3bmz91,P_Grammicus,3,Tue Jun 30 18:22:01 2015 UTC,You may want to tone down the blush a bit or find another one that doesn't make your face look so red.

If the gap that I see in picture 1(but vanishes in the other pictures?!) is still visible I'd tight line to fill it. If you wanted to make the look more natural a dark brown liner instead of a black could be substituted, but that's personal preference.  Look at a few of the non-instagram style brow tutorials to help you define them a bit further, but your looks is very pretty, lightweight, and natural looking. :)"
sugarfreemua,3bmz91,funday_2day,2,Tue Jun 30 20:40:19 2015 UTC,"The lip color looks great on you. Others have mentioned your lashes, but I think your eyes would be better enhanced by extending your liner out and up."
sugarfreemua,3bj7u7,xsmadeup,4,Mon Jun 29 17:49:35 2015 UTC,"I think omitting your flick or following the shape of your lid and having a short, slight flick down would suit your eye shape better.

sugarfreemua,3bj7u7,P_Grammicus,2,Mon Jun 29 18:16:43 2015 UTC,"Do you mean a more ""puppydog"" style liner with a wing going more out?   Not the OP, but that's what I took from it, and it's what I'd suggest myself. You've done the wings well technically, but I get this impression that the wings are going one way and your facial structure is going the other way, which is distracting and makes the wings stick out of the look. I think if you played with the length and angles a bit you'd find something that's more cohesive with the overal look.   Otherwise, I think this is a nice look for you overall."
sugarfreemua,3bj7u7,missmisfit,1 point,Mon Jun 29 23:05:49 2015 UTC,"Thank you! I was doing my wings more straight out to begin with but changed because I was afraid it made my eyes look more...droopy? I'll go back and play with it again, maybe it's just my own perception. Thank you for the feedback!! Much appreciated."
sugarfreemua,3bj7u7,opheliae,3,Tue Jun 30 00:05:21 2015 UTC,"I would do eyeliner on your lower lashes either not at all or only a bit on the outer edge as it will make your eyes seems farther apart. I like the color of it, though, I might pick it up for myself."
sugarfreemua,3b7eix,dianceparty,18,Fri Jun 26 15:56:59 2015 UTC,"Really nice! I only have a couple of little tweaks to suggest that I think could take this to the next level.  I don't think the placement of the blush is working well for the shape of your face. Instead of the apples of your cheeks, apply it to just your cheekbones, stopping at the boundary of the ""apple"" and blend it out. Something like the placement in these: 1 2 3. Wayne Goss has a pretty good video talking about application.   Secondly, I like the color of the lipstick on you, but it's coming across very metallic in photos. I think maybe the same color in a satin type finish would be much more flattering. Maybe something like Mac Brave, L'Oreal Tender Berry, NYX Thalia, or the Revlon Balm Stain in Honey.   Also, I'm noticing a little feathering on your bottom lip. I just a little steadier of a hand with the lipliner would help a lot.   All in all, though, it looks good! I love your eyes and I really like how you did your brows! (I love that I still can't manage to not sugar up things XD)"
sugarfreemua,3b7eix,CrystalElyse,3,Fri Jun 26 17:30:50 2015 UTC,"Just to piggyback on this, I have a similar face shape and learning where blush looks best on me was a huge eye opener, so I definitely second this!"
sugarfreemua,3b7eix,deanywinchester,3,Fri Jun 26 19:01:38 2015 UTC,"Thank you! Blush placement is something I struggle with because my face is quite ruddy and I also like a lot of blush. I'm going to try to apply it higher on my cheek bones next time.   I don't know why my lips are coming off as metallic, though. There is absolutely no shimmer in the products I used."
sugarfreemua,3b7eix,sass_pea,3,Fri Jun 26 20:47:49 2015 UTC,It's not so much a shimmer as a frost finish. It gives a white-ish glow when the flash hits it.

sugarfreemua,3b7eix,lateralus420,1 point,Sat Jun 27 03:42:52 2015 UTC,"That's really my only cc on the look, the blush placement. Round faces should stay away from blushing the apples of the cheeks. Doing it right above the hollows of the cheek will slim the face."
sugarfreemua,3b7eix,Hamtaur,2,Sat Jun 27 03:44:59 2015 UTC,"My only suggestion (preference, really) would be the switch up the heavy metallic lipstick that may be a little too brown for you with something that's more brighter and cooler toned. I know metallics are highly preference based and I personally have no problem with it so long as the tone brightens your skin. I think the metallic + warm ages your face vs. [insert preferred finish here] + cool tone. Hope this helps!"

Thanks for the CC!"
sugarfreemua,3b4xwi,unfunnypun,1 point,Fri Jun 26 07:44:48 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I'm also having a hard time thinking of any CC. Your foundation is great - really eliminates redness without hiding your grey freckles or glowy skin. Your lip colour looks so natural but it seeing it compared to the before photo makes me realize just how much fuller it makes your lips. Your eyebrow shape is great for your face, don't change it! The shadow on your lower lid is smudged perfectly imo.   Rather than straight up CC, I look at at your eyes and I imagine eyeshadow is pretty tricky since you don't have a lot of visible eyelid when your eyes are open. I think the shadow looks great. Do you apply your eyeliner (particularly the wings) with your eyes open or closed? The wing on your left eye seems more horizontal than the one on your right, and I wonder how they'd look if the they were both less curved and angled a little higher up. If you're applying the wings with your eyelids down/closed, I'd recommend trying with your eyes open like they are in your first photo."
sugarfreemua,3b4xwi,BlueCatIsFat,1 point,Fri Jun 26 08:07:17 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much, this is awesomely helpful!   You are right that eyeshadow is quite tricky. People always say I don't have hooded lids because technically you can see a sliver of eyelid with my eyes open, but I am pretty sure ""partially hooded"" is a thing. It's been a learning process, going out of my comfort zone and blending my shadows WAY higher up than most tutorials suggest, because otherwise, you can't see it on my eyelids. Sigh.  I did apply my eyeliner with eyes open... I think... I kind of open and close my eyes throughout the process. I do think that one came out slightly uneven though. I will certainly try a more horizontal/geometric wing, rather than the swoop shape."

sugarfreemua,3b3u0s,Nica-sauce-rex,10,Thu Jun 25 19:13:10 2015 UTC,"I think the colors you've chosen look really lovely on you--especially the eyeshadow color in the second picture (is it purple? so hard to tell on my monitor) and both lip colors. The blush looks like an excellent one for you--flattering and natural. The looks in general seem like a good start to me, and please don't take the following to mean that I don't think you look good, because that's not the case at all.  It looks to me like you have slightly downturned eyes, which the heavy eyeliner in the outer corners of the lower lashline in picture 2 is exaggerating.  In the third picture, the eyeliner on the waterline looks a bit harsh. I recommend either blending it out, using a lighter color, or skipping liner on the lower lashline entirely and using eyeshadow for a softer look.   Regarding the winged liner, if you angle it slightly higher, it can help visually lift the eyes a bit. If you're interested in checking out Youtube, Sharon Farrell has similarly downturned eyes and her looks are usually pretty flattering and wearable.  Do you curl your eyelashes? I find that curling mine makes an enormous difference in how large and awake my eyes look.  It looks like you have lots of lid space between your crease and your eyebrow. I have a similar situation. I find that putting the crease/transition shade in and slightly above my natural crease really makes a big difference."
sugarfreemua,3b3u0s,ospiteohell,3,Thu Jun 25 21:04:09 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much! This is exactly the kind of specific help I want. I have actually been playing around with only lining the top of my eye. I agree and felt the liner on the lower part of the eye made them look too small. Can you explain what you mean by ""crease/transition"" shade? Thanks!"
sugarfreemua,3b3u0s,ospiteohell,3,Thu Jun 25 21:12:21 2015 UTC,"I'm delighted to help. A crease shade is just what it sounds like--a shade that goes in the crease (or in my case, slightly above). A transition shade is an eyeshadow, usually matte, that is a couple shades darker than your natural skin tone, and it's intended to help darker shadows blend more seamlessly into lighter ones. A crease shade can also be a transition shade if you're going for a lighter look. I often will use a matte bronzer as my crease/transition because it tends to give me the perfect amount of definition for a natural look. Some examples of transition and crease shades for light to medium skin tones could be MAC Wedge, Kid, Omega, or Soft Brown; Makeup Geek Barcelona Beach, Peach Smoothie, or Creme Brulee; Urban Decay Buck, Tease, or Naked."
sugarfreemua,3b3u0s,Uhmsolike,1 point,Thu Jun 25 21:23:20 2015 UTC,"Sorry this isn't going to be specific really, but I would say pass on blush or apply significantly less. I think a more natural or muted look like your second make up photo will look best on you as opposed to bold eye make up, bright cheeks and lips etc."
sugarfreemua,3b3u0s,unfunnypun,1 point,Fri Jun 26 07:03:34 2015 UTC,"I'm not into the lip in the second picture, it's too 90s for me. I think it ages you a bit. I like the pink-red in the third picture, though! I don't like the black eyeliner, I think it's making your eyes look downturned. Maybe just on the upper lashline?  Blue eyes will pop with shades containing orange. Think warm browns, caramels, coppers, and amber, or even gold.  You're also blonde, so red lipstick will look KILLER on you! If you're nervous, start small with a gloss or tinted balm. An orangey-red looks modern and trendy, and a deep pink (as an alternative to just red) looks good on everyone. Experiment!  I think you would look awesome in a matte red lip with a shimmering amber or gold eye look, paired with a softly winged eye. Maybe use a beige pencil in the waterline and use a darker shade to add subtle definition to the outer third of your lower lashline. Very femme-fatale; modern Bond girl."
sugarfreemua,3b3u0s,spaghetios,1 point,Sat Jul 4 03:30:35 2015 UTC,"I like the color of eyeshadow in the 2nd & 3rd, which looks like pale lavender.  I also have pale blue eyes and lavenders, or grey-taupes with a lavender lean really work to bring out the blue and go with the rest of my coloring, though I am a warmish pale blond.  I agree that you might look at Sharon Farrell's videos.  She did a recent one on her wedding makeup and used MAC Satin Taupe, which is a color like I just described.  I can't use as much makeup as she does but the colors she uses might work with you and give you ideas.  With the braid you have a great healthy but sultry scandinavian look which is gorgeous.

sugarfreemua,3avmzn,skinnyjunk,1 point,Wed Jun 24 03:53:11 2015 UTC,"Much better pictures. This looks lovely on you, and I'd agree with the other suggestions. Tight lining beforehand is easier to do, because you can get a bit messy with it and the liner will cover anyway.   I think your under concealer is a bit cakey in some of this pictures, take care to blend, that Prolongwear is hefty stuff.   I really like your lip colour, and that foundation looks great."

sugarfreemua,3aovio,something_anon,7,Mon Jun 22 08:14:23 2015 UTC,"The lighting and photo quality makes it pretty hard to evaluate these, and like /u/KittenImmaculate noted, I think the two different looks makes one eye look swollen and red, even though it might be a good look for you if taken on its own."
sugarfreemua,3aovio,P_Grammicus,2,Mon Jun 22 12:19:15 2015 UTC,thank you -- for sure. i need to find time when there's daylight to experiment sometime soon.
sugarfreemua,3aovio,KittenImmaculate,4,Mon Jun 22 19:51:56 2015 UTC,"The darker eye shadow looks very nice on the right. In comparison (maybe because you're trying out two at the  same time), your left eye looks swollen. The pinkish hue looks off. If both eyes were that shade it might look better but compared to the right eye your left eye looks like you had an allergic reaction. Maybe try taking a pic of each look separately?"
sugarfreemua,3aovio,KittenImmaculate,1 point,Mon Jun 22 08:22:42 2015 UTC,"i'm surprised to hear that because in person I felt the pink shadow looked better! in and of itself that's good feedback, because it means maybe my blending with the green wasn't as bad as i thought!"
sugarfreemua,3aovio,unfunnypun,1 point,Mon Jun 22 19:52:51 2015 UTC,"It might look awesome but because you had a more subtle look on the other eye, the pink one looked swollen/allergic to something. I don't think your blending was poor on either eye. But maybe try the pink look on both eyes and post it again so we can get a better impression!

Your skin looks great and I think your brows are a great shape and looks very natural.   I don't see your blush at all in your face on pictures, it's not adding much glow or dimension to your look. The side pictures look like the placement is too far back and low, though the colour looks good. I think adding more blush a little higher, more to the apples of your cheeks than far back near your hairline would add some colour and glow and really add to the look."

I'd also be interested in seeing a photo without glasses too.  Regardless, from what I can see, I love the eyeshadow and lip colour choices, big thumbs up for your eyebrows, and everything looks nicely blended and applied. The blush placement seems a little low on the apple of your cheek and I think you could smudge/soften the liner on your lower lid a little, particularly on your left eye."

Other than that, I'm into it.  You might want to consider very slightly over-drawing your lips, as well. Or adding a bit of gloss to the center.

sugarfreemua,3afoqw,Ezb2247,6,Fri Jun 19 19:27:25 2015 UTC,"Okay. So the first thing that jumps out at me are your eyes. I think you could really rock the puppy eye sort of look! (Google it if you haven't seen it. I don't think I can explain it very well.) But it would look great! Or I think you could really pull off some smokey brown liner and rose gold/bronze-y eyes with feathery lashes. Other than your eyes I would say get your brows cleaned up! They have a great shape already, but having them trimmed up a little bit works wonders! Add a little foundation or something with a bit more coverage and a peachy blush and it would be gorgeous! But that's just my opinion. :)"

I think you should trim your left eyebrow hairs on the top a little bit - the start looks a little bit long. I also think that your skin tone would be improved just from spot concealing, if you want to keep from using a higher coverage foundation."
sugarfreemua,3afoqw,unfunnypun,1 point,Sat Jun 20 15:01:59 2015 UTC,A little more blush :) and a bitta highlighter on the tops of your cheekbones to make them pop.

I think it'll make a world of difference, you already have really nice and full looking brows, so it'll probably save you time filling them in, too."
sugarfreemua,3aftkm,climatact,2,Fri Jun 19 20:05:05 2015 UTC,"This is the look I created for an interview for a tech support job today for a small ISP in my area.

sugarfreemua,3aftkm,LacquerCritic,2,Fri Jun 19 20:05:19 2015 UTC,"I think you could bring your eyebrows a little closer into the center - nothing crazy or a super defined edge, but I think they'd be more flattering to your face that way. For your left eye (right in the picture) it's hard to tell whether it's from the lighting or not, but based on the picture the darker shadow could be blended in a bit more towards the centre of your lid.  That all being said, I think it's a great look for an interview for a tech support job. Professional and feminine, and it looks great for the weather you described."
sugarfreemua,3aftkm,P_Grammicus,2,Fri Jun 19 22:10:13 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the critique!

sugarfreemua,3a7jkr,empatheticapathy,10,Wed Jun 17 21:06:32 2015 UTC,"Wow, that looks like a perfect MLLB colour on you, I thought you just had a little gloss on. All the makeup looks natural and easy and is quite well applied. I like all the colours, it's a nice, neutral sort of look for you. You could blend your eyeshadow a bit more in the crease. Any suggestions I have are purely in the spirit of changing things up a bit and playing around, I don't think there's anything here that particularly needs correction.   Because of the shape of your face, eyes, and particularly your cheekbones, I don't think that classic diagonal contour is particularly necessary for you. I'd like to see you play with your high, wide cheekbones by using a brighter blush in a more horizontal application, mostly on the apples of your cheeks. I think this would show off your bone structure well, especially if paired with a little cheekbone highlight.   Your brows are natural, and I like the shape.  I think you could glam your look up a lot just by a very minor tweeze and fill in, though I wouldn't change the look of them as much as just define them.   Your eyes are tilted a bit, which is lovely, and your wings accentuate that. If you haven't played with other liner styles, such as ""puppy eyes"", or thicknesses that open up the eye without elongating it, I think you could wear a lot of different looks and look great doing it."
sugarfreemua,3a7jkr,P_Grammicus,7,Thu Jun 18 00:10:40 2015 UTC,I think you could lengthen your eyebrows a bit
sugarfreemua,3a7jkr,floweronwall,2,Thu Jun 18 01:00:13 2015 UTC,"Very natural lip color, great MLBB look on you. I wish your eyeshadow didn't extend past your liner, and that your eyeliner had been slightly extended a bit more before you created the wing.  You naturally have almond eyes (pretty!), though, and I wonder what you would look like with more of a puppy-eyed look. Or even with curled lashes and mascara alone, perhaps with a little beige liner in the waterline. You have really unique features.  I think you could benefit from subtly lengthening your brows. I also want to see some highlight action on those killer cheekbones."
sugarfreemua,3a7jkr,unfunnypun,4,Tue Jun 23 19:09:21 2015 UTC,"I really like the lip colour and the eyeshadow! I would try tweezing your brows a bit underneath for a neater look and if you're willing to dabble with extending the tail of your brow, that would also help, IMO."

I've had pretty good results using Blinc to build some length then using a waterproof mascara (either Clinique or BareMinerals) but not bringing the brush all the way through my lash tips. It tends to look clumpy if I try to apply another mascara on top of the little tubes Blinc and other tubing mascaras create."
sugarfreemua,3a3d30,lechoro,1 point,Tue Jun 16 22:53:18 2015 UTC,So it looks clumpy layered but you got good results with waterproof? (A little confused still)
sugarfreemua,3a3d30,pixel_pepper,2,Wed Jun 17 00:47:26 2015 UTC,It looks clumpy if I use the waterproof lashes all the way to the tubed tips of my lashes. For some reason it doesn't clump if I stick to the lower half of my lashes.

sugarfreemua,3a3d30,eau_de_humanity,1 point,Wed Jun 17 03:22:12 2015 UTC,"Did you try curling your lashes before or after applying the mascara?  If after, maybe the mascara dried and stiffened beside you got them entirely curled? You might try curling them first and then applying the mascara."
sugarfreemua,3a1lgb,dutchessgummybunz,21,Tue Jun 16 14:52:51 2015 UTC,"It looks pretty muddy. Next time, spend an extra few seconds to clean up your inner corners which have black gunk in them, to blend out your eyeshadow more, and to make sure your eyeliner is straight. Also I think the black eyeliner on your lower lash line makes your eyes look smaller. Instead, opt for a nude eyeliner to make them pop and take some of your eyeshadow you used and extend it a little to your lower lash line if you want some color down there."
sugarfreemua,3a1lgb,im-a-boss-ass-bitch,30,Tue Jun 16 17:23:06 2015 UTC,"I think you need to take some clearer photos with multiple angles. Head on, from the side, eye closeup, etc...and preferably in natural light. I'd love to give you some CC, but it's very hard to see the makeup clearly."

sugarfreemua,3a1lgb,VaneFreja,3,Tue Jun 16 19:41:53 2015 UTC,exactly :)
sugarfreemua,3a1lgb,PrincessCate,9,Wed Jun 17 07:01:34 2015 UTC,It looks muddy and I think you need to practice on your liner. I think lining the bottom lash doesn't really look great and it's brought in way too close to the inner corner of your eye
sugarfreemua,3a1lgb,luciferthecat10,4,Tue Jun 16 18:57:37 2015 UTC,Thanks for the CC everyone! I will try a nude eyeliner in my waterline and maybe some neutral colors instead of brights. And also clean up my eyeliner and be more patient. That's my biggest issue with eyeliner is having no patience.
sugarfreemua,3a1lgb,a_typical_hipster,8,Tue Jun 16 19:06:06 2015 UTC,"It looks like you put the green lid color on your inner eye corner, which is not a good idea. You should be putting a lighter, shimmery color on the inner eye corner to open up your eyes. I also am not sure green is exactly the best color on you. Makeup is about doing what makes you happy, but I think you should try a more neutral look."
sugarfreemua,3a1lgb,unfunnypun,8,Tue Jun 16 16:13:39 2015 UTC,I'd say add gold or bronze not necessarily neutral and still pops.

sugarfreemua,39iw2d,shareberry,1 point,Fri Jun 12 01:01:44 2015 UTC,"Your eye makeup looks great for a 3rd attempt! It's a very nice polished look for day time or even work. I really like the shape of your eyeshadow; dragging the edges out slightly elongates the eye which I really like.   I definitely think you could go bolder! (probably more for a more daring day look, girls night out or something like that). Personally I think it's blended enough - especially for a day look. When you have monolids too much blending can make it look too smoky and heavy for a day time look. However, if you are looking to go bolder, you definitely could take the eyeshadow up higher considering you have quite a lot of space from your lash line to brow. I find it helps to put a medium matte shade to ""carve out a crease"" or mark where you want your eyeshadow to end up. Then pack colour on the whole lid area up to where the medium matte shade is. Then darken the ""crease"" area with darker matte shade.  Just judging from the eyeshadow placement and Korean products in your product list, you might like meejmuse from Youtube. She has great smoky and day time eye looks for monolids!"
sugarfreemua,39iw2d,szarkasm,1 point,Fri Jun 12 04:45:41 2015 UTC,Your blush placement looks a little off. One cheek looks considerably higher than the other.
sugarfreemua,39iw2d,luciferthecat10,1 point,Tue Jun 16 16:15:00 2015 UTC,"First of all, that is a great lip color on you.   Second of all, I think you should add a white shimmer color to the inner corner of your eyes, and your brown bone to open up your eyes a little.   Third of all, have you ever tried a white/nude eyeliner on your lower lash line? I think you should look into that because it also opens up your eyes more and also just looks lovely.   All over, you look great though"
sugarfreemua,39iw2d,im-a-boss-ass-bitch,1 point,Tue Jun 16 17:27:27 2015 UTC,I wish you would blend that brown out a bit. A gradient look looks much softer and adds more dimension to monolids.

sugarfreemua,39f93p,noys,3,Fri Jun 12 01:49:15 2015 UTC,"I think it looks good, I would use a touch of mascara on the lower lashes or softly smudged brown eyeshadow in the outer 1/3 of bottom lashes to balance the intensity on the top lid.  I also propose a minor brow shape change. I think softening and pushing the arch back a little bit and lifting the tails would really work for you."

sugarfreemua,397g4v,mostlyqueer,30,Tue Jun 9 20:18:58 2015 UTC,"I know this is sugarfree, but I gotta say I wish I could have done my makeup that well when I was in hs!  It's pretty near perfect.   You don't need a lash comb, you need a spoolie brush.  Using a lash comb with that much mascara can pull out some lashes.  Sephora has disposable spoolie brushes for applying sample mascara, so you can just grab a couple next time you're there. I think your blush goes too high up along your hairline, especially on the left. Because your blush is so pink, IMO it should be brought forward toward the apples of your cheeks a little.  A peachier blush can sit on your cheekbones like you did it and look natural/elegant, but a pinky blush placed there can look a bit sunburnt.   Congrats on graduating!"
sugarfreemua,397g4v,danyquinn,7,Tue Jun 9 20:38:45 2015 UTC,"Thank you! I tried the spoolie and it did indeed help a lot! I love doing blush and have been experimenting with placement since a lot of tutorials suggest higher placement for people with rounder faces, but I never considered taking color into account- I can definitely see what you mean about peach vs pink and looking more sunburnt. Do you have any tips for blending out blush that you've already applied to a less than ideal spot?"
sugarfreemua,397g4v,PurpleOrangesOkay,1 point,Tue Jun 9 20:54:09 2015 UTC,I second this advice! Excellent look overall. I don't think its too harsh at all; very appropriate for a grad ceremony.
sugarfreemua,397g4v,thefinish,5,Wed Jun 10 06:17:24 2015 UTC,"Just echoing the comments about the blush placement - its a bit too strong towards your hairline. Either peachier colour (as suggested), or just feather it out from the apples of your cheeks.  And you could use an eyelash curler on the upper lashes to give you a slightly more wide-eyed look if you want.   Another tip, I don't know if these photos were taken with a flash or not, but for something like a graduation, its good to see what the makeup would look like with a flash/without, and in different lighting. (Is the graduation indoors/outdoors etc. - and test to match). Hope this helped, but otherwise what you have is gorgeous!"

Also, I've really been loving warm peachy colors for summer, so if you have any recommendations for products that would be greatly appreciated!

sugarfreemua,38yem4,automatedcrumpet,7,Sun Jun 7 22:14:41 2015 UTC,"I have a ""daily brush cleaner"" spray from sephora that's pretty much just an alcohol spray. I imagine something like that would work. Just, give it a light misting and let it fully dry out and you'll be fine.  Though, unless they look or smell funny, they probably haven't had enough organic material in there to really feed any bacteria long term. It may not work as well as ""fresh"" eyeshadows (not as pigmented, drier, doesn't blend as well), but it should be fine to just use."
sugarfreemua,38yem4,CrystalElyse,1 point,Mon Jun 8 00:24:24 2015 UTC,I wonder if you could put them on aluminum foil and bake them in the oven? I think bacteria is killed at 140 degrees after a few minutes. Don't know what if would do to the makeup if it were more than just pigment and minerals.

sugarfreemua,38vz0e,curiouspeach,34,Sun Jun 7 08:00:28 2015 UTC,"I love your base, very flawless. Your foundation looks a bit too yellow/dark compared to your chest, but that might just be the lighting. I also think you could benefit from some highlighter! I love the brows, apart from what /u/edgt has already said.   I think the lip color isn't right though, I believe it makes you look older than you really are (or older than I think you are) and the application is a bit sloppy. It emphasizes your thinner upper lip instead of evening them out. Lip colors aren't really my forte so I'm having a hard time suggesting something else though...   Love the colors for the eyes, although I wouldn't bring the crease color that far up to your brow. Especially in pic 4 your eyeliner looks a bit wonky.   Are you going to do the makeup yourself on the big day or have it done by this girl? :)"
sugarfreemua,38vz0e,draupert,83,Sun Jun 7 10:39:44 2015 UTC,"Personally, it says more club to me than wedding. Everything is a bit harsh."
sugarfreemua,38vz0e,m3owbox,64,Sun Jun 7 10:27:02 2015 UTC,"I feel like this is a classic example of a MUA doing makeup strictly ""by the book,"" with zero intuitive, genuinely artistic or sensitive attention to the details. It's overall very harsh, and I feel like I'm looking at makeup, and not your beautiful face."
sugarfreemua,38vz0e,PrioriIncantatem,12,Sun Jun 7 14:04:20 2015 UTC,"It might just be lighting (if you'd turned into the sun, you'd have a much better idea of how it looks!), but the foundation looks a little yellow/dark to me.  It also looks a bit flat.  Like your skin looks flawless and the application itself is not cakey, but it still somehow looks too thick.  If your natural skin is good, I think a thinner application (lighter coverage, better color match, more concealer/less foundation) might be better.  I've noticed mac face makeup can look like that/is often applied like that.  Most of the women working there have the same look.  Mac Face and Body might be a good idea.  It looks like she was a bit sloppy with your eyeliner, if you're going to have her do it, and I'd be curious as to what you'd look like with brown/bronze/gold/warmer neutrals on your eyes rather than cooler ones.  I think it contrasts a bit much with how warm your skin (or foundation) is.    I do really like the bold, boho wedding look though."
sugarfreemua,38vz0e,cicadaselectric,12,Sun Jun 7 14:57:05 2015 UTC,"I don't think the makeup does justice to your natural beauty.  If applied more skilfully, the brightly colored makeup would look outstanding.  But this lacks the precision you deserve.  I also think the lighting in your photos is making them a bit blurry, but here are my thoughts:  1) In the outer corners of your eyes, it almost looks like you're wearing false eyelashes that are falling off or too long for your lids.  Not sure if you're even wearing false lashes--perhaps your eyeliner was applied at too sharp an angle?    2) If you like the bold lip color, there's no reason to tone it down.  But if you're going bright, I'd recommend having it applied a bit neater.  In specifics, the left side of your bottom lip is off shape. Also, It looks like they used liner--perhaps this is just the photo lighting--but the liner looks a shade off from the lipstick.  i'd recommend filling in the entire lip with liner before applying the lipstick so there is no outline effect.  3)  As noted in other comments, the brow color needs to be blended in.  4) The eyeshadow is applied heavily and is very shimmery.  It might look amazing with your silver dress.  But I also think it might be worth experimenting something a bit less harsh,"
sugarfreemua,38vz0e,yellowpeach,14,Sun Jun 7 20:27:35 2015 UTC,"Had a trial run of my wedding makeup done at Mac yesterday and I'd love some CC on it.

sugarfreemua,38vz0e,StarrySwoosh,5,Sun Jun 7 08:03:16 2015 UTC,"I'll have to agree with some of the others that the eyebrows seem a bit off. One is definitely a bit less filled in.   Also, it looks like there's a crease going from your nose to your chin."

However, I would probably prefer the brows to be softer and less harsh, as they seem a bit over-powering to me..."
sugarfreemua,38vz0e,lateralus420,6,Sun Jun 7 14:35:59 2015 UTC,"I think your eyebrows are too close together. They should begin where the edge of your nostrils are.  And I agree with the person who said that lip color makes you look older. A lighter color would also get rid of the ""club"" look someone else mentioned. Definitely use a lip liner too for a more precise application.  Other than that it looks great."
sugarfreemua,38vz0e,edgt,8,Sun Jun 7 18:43:35 2015 UTC,"I am by no means a makeup guru, but the thing that jumped out at me was one of your eyebrows doesn't look quite as filled in as the other. It's the one on your right (so left in the photo). It's a teeny thing, but there are going to be lots of photos on the day, so I'd double-check on the day that there isn't that little line, as there is here.

sugarfreemua,38vz0e,unfunnypun,6,Tue Jun 16 19:01:15 2015 UTC,"Pictures without skin blurring filters would be nice.... Based off what we can see, though:   Your falsies look kind of downturned, and they're dragging your pretty eyes down with them. Make sure they're all curled up for the big day! I also wish the bottom liner was more subtle/diffused. As a lipstick enthusiast, love that red. But I would like the edges more perfected, especially because it's bright. Don't be ashamed of very slightly over-drawing to make your lips more even-looking. It might be the application, but it looks like the left side of your upper lip is a bit fuller than the right. Also, if you're going for an ""offbeat"" look, maybe try an orange-red, or a fun, pink-red? This is a very ""classic"" color, and with your heavy brows and winged eyes, it's reading a bit retro. Which is cool, but I don't know if that's what you wanted. With a bright lip, and for weddings, I would like more blush and highlighter. I feel like your face is being a bit overpowered by all the other colorful elements you've got going on. I wish your brows were less filled in, they look like they're pretty full naturally. Also, it looks like the product was purposely dragged down in a curve to extend your brow? I feel like it looks too exaggerated."
sugarfreemua,38vz0e,Hi_im_Callista,2,Sun Jun 7 21:03:22 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I don't think it's too much for a wedding but I like bold looks and it really depends on your wedding's theme/atmosphere/dress. This look would be pretty neat for a 1920's themed wedding but if you're having a kind of traditional white gown type of wedding then you might want to use a lighter lip and go softer on the eyes and skip the eyeliner all together. The brows are pretty harsh for any setting, they just stick out of your face. They look a bit dark for your hair but that might be the lighting but they are very striking, try to go a little bit softer on it by drawing very very small hair like strokes. Your lip is kind of shakey so my suggestion would be using a lip liner to line the lip cleanly, a thin layer of lip stain and whatever color above that, gently patting off excess and cleaning up the edges with a little bit of your foundation. I would really take a lot of time trying to be precise with your lips and your brows for this as they really do frame the face and they really stick out for photographs."
sugarfreemua,38vz0e,dun_dun_dunn,2,Sun Jun 7 22:50:05 2015 UTC,"In addition to all the comments that have already been made, I'm wondering what your wedding colours would be? You would want your wedding makeup to be harmonious with it, rather than harsh and clashing. I would also make sure that what you're wearing isn't TOO far a departure from what you normally wear, so that you'll still live the way you look when you look at pictures in a couple years :)"

sugarfreemua,38vz0e,HeTaughtMeWell,2,Mon Jun 8 06:14:40 2015 UTC,You're a gorgeous girl and I think your makeup could be perfected with just a light blotting on your lips and across your brows for a little softening. It would still be dramatic but would be less severe and would enhance your natural beauty.
sugarfreemua,38vz0e,noys,2,Mon Jun 8 07:14:03 2015 UTC,"I agree, the lip colour is off. I'd go with something slightly more MLBB that'd let the eye makeup shine and a less high maintenance formula. Maybe a good lip stain?"
sugarfreemua,38vtmf,lookxitsxlauren,7,Sun Jun 7 06:43:18 2015 UTC,"Alright so the majority of the look is great, but the eyeshadow is the main thing that leaps out at me. The shape and amount that is applied could be improved; it doesn't need to go that far up your lid while being that concentrated. You should apply less product, closer to your lash line and the crease, then focus on blending upwards and outwards. This is a quick diagram I just found, from that shape of application you can then blend like crazy. I think when you have such a dramatic look like that with such minimal blending, it can look like you've got black eyes unfortunately. Colours you've used suit you awesomely, those autumn colours are fantastic. You could also branch into purples/dark reds/pinks possibly. I'd stay away from light blues/greens, but that's just my opinion.   Eyebrows you could fill a little further in if you want a 'fiercer' look, but that is just fashion at present moment, your brows suit your face as is.   Mascara looks really great, I love Covergirl's clump crusher series but you could run a spoolie (an old, clean mascara brush) through your mascaraed lashes just to 'fluff' them out a bit, but that's just me being nit-picky. They look great as is!  Blush and foundation look great too, well done :)"

sugarfreemua,38vtmf,ECoco,1 point,Sun Jun 7 20:57:55 2015 UTC,"I recommend getting a cheap palate (new of course) off eBay/amazon. It's not gonna great quality but with a good primer it stays on fine and it's really good for practising a wide range of what colours look good/not. For liner I love liquid for more formal stuff because I can never be bothered doing wings day to day, I just use gel everyday for waterline.

I think all the colours you have chosen suit you quite well, while there's a little difference in the lighting I think your foundation matches nicely and your application is excellent.   Personally, I think you can do with a little more blush and a little more glow - where one lands on the matte/dewey continuum is a matter of personal choice, but you have great skin and a little highlighter and/or less matte finish will play that up.   Your brows are a great shape and look very natural. If you want a more dramatic look you have everything you need to intensify them, it's a versatile and flattering shape for you.   Your lip could be crisper, especially for a more dramatic look, but I prefer the look one gets with finger application for natural looks, that may not be how you applied this but that's how it looks. If you don't have a sharply delineated lip line but want something crisper a lip liner is in order.   I think you're on the right track with your eye shadow, though your left eye has a darker and higher crease colour.   Overall, really flattering and nicely done!"

Here's a guide for eyebrow shaping if you feel inclined to DIY: http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Yd4OJQwltPU/T8TfgoIM0pI/AAAAAAAAAYE/RLO7hDgzr_Y/s1600/eyebrowshape.jpg That will really bring femininity and a delicateness to your face. I also find the brows to be too dark. Try to be lighter handed when filling your brows as to make them more natural looking.   For your eye shadow, it's really hard to see with your eyes open. It looks like you've got hooded eyes, which are notoriously hard to use shadow on effectively. Unfortunately, I can't give you techniques on hooded eyes. But I'm sure someone else in this sub will have advice! However, on the color it really needs to be blended more. As it stands it is a very harsh line, which is the totally enemy of looking natural. I might even go with something lighter/neutral.   I think your lip color is really pretty! It's a little pale for your skin, but maybe that's the light. You've got really full and well shaped lips, and you might think about making them the focal point of your look.   As a side note, please do not try to emulate the MAC employees makeup. Whenever I go in there (I love their blush) I just feel like they are so cake faced. And the techniques they use just don't look natural at all. Sometimes it even looks more masculine than feminine, which I think is the opposite of what you're going for.   I'd love to see your progress! Please, please keep us updated. :)"
sugarfreemua,38j5ha,secondtaint,11,Thu Jun 4 16:45:48 2015 UTC,"As the owner of some deeply hooded eyes I was coming in to mention that too.  Hooded eyes require their own techniques, there are some really good videos on YouTube if you google them.   In my case I had to master the cut crease, but you will most likely want to lift the darker color up a little more into the crease and above it & wear a lighter color on your eyelid, which counter intuitively will demphasise the hooding and also mean some of the color is visible when you open your eyes.  Blending is a big help with this as you can blend the darker crease color up so that it is visible when you open your eyes.  Mac have some really great brushes, I like the 217 for blending, the main trick with eyeshadow is blend and blend some more.   It's a little hard to see your foundation in the lighting of you photo, but if you don't have one use a damp beauty blender to do foundation, it makes it almost fool proof.  The trick is to soak the blender until it feels like jelly then squeeze out the excess water.   Also you might want to look into tightlining with the eyeliner, it can help with hooding too by not covering up the eye color and still give you that eyeliner look, I also find it easier than doing eyeliner.   The advice about eyebrows others have given is great, I still cannot fill in my eyebrows for love nor money, so I just get them shaped.   The main advice I can give is practice, practice, practice.  It really is the best way to work out what works for your particular face shape, skin, eye combo.  Look forward to seeing your progress."
sugarfreemua,38j5ha,wwaxwork,1 point,Thu Jun 4 17:27:51 2015 UTC,I bought the 217 when I went to the store.  I was using that for most of the shadows.  I guess I just have to get more comfortable with the blending. I'll figure that out.    I just got my beauty blender today.  I also am waiting for my full coverage foundation.  I do know about the damp beauty blender so I'll be incorporating that next time around.   I'll look into that with the tightline.    Yeah I'lll figure out the brows.  Thanks!
sugarfreemua,38j5ha,secondtaint,1 point,Fri Jun 5 06:19:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah the lighting in my room sucks.  I'll figure that out next time I post.    I definitely can't get them shaped.  It would honestly raise way too many questions.  I'll think about it though.  My eyebrows are pretty distinguishing to my face to begin with.  If I got them shaped for a feminine brow, it would immediately send a red flag to people.  I might use the tape trick that many CDs use.  I will deifnitely be lighter handed though.  I absolutely put too much on there.    I do have hooded eyes.  I found a few YouTube videos that help with hooded eyes so I'm going to try them next time.  Yeah the blending is what I'm trying to get the hang of.  The longer I looked at the picture the more I saw what I could've done to make it look better.  It looks almost placed on there with no shading or subtlety at all.    Thank you for the lip compliment!  I agree.  I always wanted my lips to be a focal point.  They're perfectly plump and a good shape as you mentioned.  I'll try a more bold look next time.    The store artist that helped me is exactly what you are talking about.  It didn't look natural at all on here.  Like it screamed ""I'M WEARING MAKEUP"".    Thanks honey!"
sugarfreemua,38j5ha,basilcilantro,2,Fri Jun 5 06:10:56 2015 UTC,"I totally understand not waxing your eyebrows, especially if you're trying to be on the down low. Hot eyebrows just might raise some eyebrows (haha, jokes right?).   Makeup is tricky. I've been doing mine for almost ten years and I'm just now really nailing down what works for me. I went through a really serious red lip phase, overpowering power brows, no brows, you name it. It just takes some time and practice to really figure out what works for your face. Keep playing with your styles and techniques whenever you can, and you'll get the hang of it!"
sugarfreemua,38j5ha,P_Grammicus,4,Fri Jun 5 06:34:36 2015 UTC,A suggestion about your eyebrows is that you can get then shaped and then pencil in your boy brows for your everyday look.
sugarfreemua,38j5ha,missmisfit,26,Fri Jun 5 09:56:21 2015 UTC,"I'm going to assume that you're presenting full time now or in the near future and are going for a classically natural, feminine sort of look. As an aside, it's really not rough in here at all, it's just useful information without a lot of ""you're so brave and perfect"" nonsense.   You've had very good advice, and I don't had much else to offer. However, as someone with mature skin, I want to caution you against going as full coverage foundation wise as you might be inclined to do. It can end up looking really heavy, and that can end up backfiring on you. As an older woman a few skin imperfections showing through makeup are going to make you look more natural and feminine rather than using heavy foundation.   I think a slightly darker, slightly less pink lip colour would suit your face better, it's a little immature looking, though it goes well with your colouring.   The next time you post, and I really hope you do, better lighting and full face photos are going to garner you much better advice. I know that can be hard to produce, but it's worth it."
sugarfreemua,38j5ha,Inkcat,2,Thu Jun 4 19:51:51 2015 UTC,I'm actually not even close to being full-time nor will I ever be honestly.  I just want to make sure I look my absolute best when I decide to dress.  Thank you though!   I'll try that suggestion with the lip color.    Yeah my lighting sucks. I'll figure that out.
sugarfreemua,38j5ha,Jorcky,19,Fri Jun 5 06:21:01 2015 UTC,"Your pictures and descriptions are great, and you look, in general, very nice but you can kinda tell that you don't do makeup a lot. I like to practice when I get home at night so I can go kinda crazy without the pressure of having someplace to go. Your lipstick application needs a little cleaning up, but you know how to color within the lines, you just need some more practice (I am not awesome at perfect lipstick application either). Bring thyself to an eyebrow threader or waxer. If you present as a man mostly, I still think that is perfectly fine, the amount of men I see with groomed brows is growing every day. I just think it will lift your whole face up and make you seem more bright and lady like.   Congrats on your fun new hobby! It's a money pit but it sure is enjoyable!"
sugarfreemua,38j5ha,theliquordoghouse,2,Thu Jun 4 16:51:28 2015 UTC,It sure is a money pit!  But it's the price we all pay to look beautiful haha.
sugarfreemua,38j5ha,cicadaselectric,6,Fri Jun 5 06:21:33 2015 UTC,"To piggyback on u/theliquordoghouse you have hooded eyes (not bad or uncommon at all!) and that makes eye makeup so much harder to do. Basically, most looks will be assuming that you have more space on your eyelid and less space above the crease than you actually do, so when you follow the directions, you end up looking unbalanced and drawing attention to your brow bone instead of your eyes.  This video was a game changer for me: https://youtu.be/XI9yzZxU2zs (you can skip the first 1:50). Try googling for tutorials specifically for hooded eyes--it makes a huge difference in your overall look.   All best luck! You've got a great start!"

sugarfreemua,38j5ha,HiDefcan,11,Fri Jun 5 17:17:37 2015 UTC,"I just wanted to second pretty much everything /u/secondtaint said.  The two biggest standouts for me was the unblended eyeshadow and the eyebrows, in terms of shape, color, and blending. I would add the running a brow brush through a few times will help to even it out and give it a light, more natural look. If, for whatever reason, you don't want to change your brows through shaping, I recommend watching videos that will help you to artificially shape your brows with concealer, etc.   I do have hooded eyes, and the biggest thing I can recommend is finding your 'perfect 3' - a base, highlight, and crease color that fit together. Finding the right place to put your crease color will do the most for you in creating the right depth for your eyes, as well as opening them up. I tend to have a 'natural' collection, 'going out' collection, and 'fun' collection' to balance out all my needs. (That's a lie, I have so much more...) Check out /r/Indiemakeupandmore for smaller companies you can order lots of samples from for cheap. I love Shiro Cosmetics and Hello Waffle Cosmetics. Also, blend, blend, blend. Finding 'your' wing technique for eyeliner will also help. Hooded eyes like to mess with the outside tails of eyeliner.   As for not mimicking the MAC consultant's look... I agree again. They tend to be overdone and emphasize a drag queen/king-like look. However, if you enjoy the 'I AM WEARING MAKE-UP' look, go for it! I recommend going to multiple places, and picking the make-up artists that (routinely) has a look you enjoy. They're going to be able to relate and reproduce for you the easiest, whatever that may be.  Last note - I know you said you wanted full coverage, but I really recommend looking at MAC's Face and Body. On more mature skin, a lighter and more dewy coverage tends to keep from looking cakey or heavy handed. I use a stippling brush and LURVS the results. See if you can grab a sample.  That being said, I'm super glad you had a positive experience, and can't wait to see your updates. You better have some updates by the way.   Damn, forgot two things. #1 - green colored primer. Helps to reduce ruddiness and can help cover acne so you can use a lighter foundation. Also, more concealer is better than a heavier foundation."
sugarfreemua,38j5ha,mega_trex,1 point,Thu Jun 4 17:07:20 2015 UTC,Thank you so much for the tips!!  I have been watching videos all night on how to help with the brows and the blending.    I agree with your MAC cousultant comments completely.  They're super nice at least.    I'll look at that foundation if I feel the one I have coming is too cakey
sugarfreemua,38k10i,Lizowa,7,Thu Jun 4 18:58:12 2015 UTC,"First of all, congrats on your wedding! I agree with you, the blush is too orange for wedding day (however I think it would be a gorgeous summer blush on other days)! I also think your blush placement is a tad too high. Bringing it down a bit and adding a highlighter above it would really make your face lighten up a bit. Are you planning to wear your glasses on the big day? Do you possibly have a pic straight on your face?  It would be a bit easier to give CC if we could see the symmetry of both sides.   Edit to say I really love the lip color. Perfect ""my lips but better"" for the big day."
sugarfreemua,38k10i,unclefuckerImustsay,2,Thu Jun 4 19:16:10 2015 UTC,"Thank you! I took these pictures yesterday so I don't know if I have one straight on, I will check. I was avoiding using the selfie camera so pics would be better quality but then I can't see what I'm taking a picture of lol. I am wearing my glasses on the wedding day, I've never wore contacts before so I don't think I can start now comfortably haha. I definitely agree with you about the blush placement, thank you!"
sugarfreemua,38k10i,unclefuckerImustsay,2,Thu Jun 4 19:36:45 2015 UTC,"I understand! If you take some CC and show us your retry, be sure to take some more forward facing pics!"
sugarfreemua,38k10i,P_Grammicus,3,Thu Jun 4 19:48:31 2015 UTC,"I agree with everything you've commented on and on /u/unclefuckerImustsay 's CC. In particular, a straight on pic is essential, and if your wedding has any outside activities, in natural lighting.   I think you're on the right track with colours for your eyes, skin, and lip, and you're already doing everything I'd suggest wrt the blush. I think you can up the highlighter a bit.  Your eyebrows look pretty ragged right now, are you growing them out?  The colour is good, as is the basic shape, but they need smoother application, etc.   Are you overdrawing your upper lip?  I love the colour and finish, but it looks like it's overdrawn and it's enough to be distracting.   If you're wearing your glasses, straight on pics with them on and off would be very helpful."

I don't overdraw my lips at all! I don't have to. Here's a picture of them right now with no makeup http://imgur.com/jwZB1o9 I just have big lips :("

sugarfreemua,389lmj,streasure,24,Tue Jun 2 20:01:31 2015 UTC,"With your eyebrows, I think they are too dramatic. You can make them softer by making them less square in the middle as well as longer on the ends to create a more natural look.   For your eye makeup, I don't think it's the best application for your eye shape. The under liner really closes your eyes, and the upper liner being so strong compounds the issue. I think it would look really great if you used more browns and warmer colors on your eyes. If you blended the shadow wing more towards the center of your brow bone that would really open your eyes up a lot!   On your lips, the color is beautiful! It really pops on your skin. But, if you get a lip liner I think the whole look would benefit from evening out your bottom lip line. Right now, it's rather skewed.   Final note: of you don't want your post deleted you have to put up your product list ASAP!   Keep us updated! :)"
sugarfreemua,389lmj,secondtaint,2,Tue Jun 2 22:01:44 2015 UTC,"I dont like the under eye eyeliner either, but I think I look weird without it.   I will be redoing my eyebrows to make them softer.  Thanks for the advise :)"
sugarfreemua,389lmj,tits_mcgee0123,3,Tue Jun 2 22:15:16 2015 UTC,Maybe try it with brown and sticking to only the outer 1/3 of your eye? That would soften it without eliminating it completely.
sugarfreemua,389lmj,Muffikins,3,Wed Jun 3 00:01:02 2015 UTC,"I find using a thin brush with some of the darkest shadow I'm using in my look that day, and using that along my lower lash line, helps keep my eyes defined but more open. I've shied away from eyeliner at all and you might not need it either. I also often do a ""soft cut crease"", where I make a dark crease but keep the lid light, line the lower lashes of course - all without using black liner to define the cut crease look. That's a good style for smaller eyes, mine are hidden behind glasses. It can be tough to learn to flatter them well!  Edit: this was yesterday just a super simple look, I'm not one for too much or too flawless, myself. But I don't have big eyes, and I think having a lighter lid and darker crease can help them pop... Just IMO though, someone may tell me I suck or you might not like it, and that's cool too :)"
sugarfreemua,389lmj,Muffikins,4,Wed Jun 3 04:23:21 2015 UTC,I have been thinking this too. When I go back to the store I may ask for the shade lighter because I really love this foundation. It stays on great.   I ask people what their opinion is but they insist that its the right color. I don't know though :/
sugarfreemua,389lmj,Rosewolf,1 point,Tue Jun 2 22:08:04 2015 UTC,"Using a primer under the foundation can help keep it from oxidizing, which can turn a matching shade too orange later on.

Have you tried more dramatic looks with this palette?  While they are all nice looks, the palette doesn't seem to be really versatile for you.

Photography is only one aspect of how you look on your wedding day, and you don't want to look odd in person.   I think your brow colour and more natural look is fine. While your eyebrows don't need to be perfectly symmetrical, and I think they look fine like this, I do understand your frustration.  I have a similar issue with my brows and it's because my brow hairs at the starting point grow at different angles - my left brow hairs grow up and my right brow hairs grow straight along the brow line. I find that one way to minimize this is to really practice the initial line - the lower line of each brow, so that each of those lines are as symmetrical as possible.  If I can get those lines right, the fill and any other shaping is a breeze and it is easier to make the tiny adjustments needed."

Sorry to post again so soon, but I'm trying to get everything as perfect as I can and I only have a week left!  First, ignore my eye makeup, I just put something on so my eyes wouldn't be totally naked. I figure I have my eye makeup look down, so no need to do it again.   I am trying to work on not blending my contour out too much. But in person I can see it a little bit, so I'm not sure I can go much heavier without looking like I have a gray-brown streak on my face.  I think my brows are better than before, but I can't get them to match at the start. Individually, they look good, and they match closely enough everywhere else, it's just that starting point where they look different and I can't figure out how to get them looking more similar. I don't care if they're perfectly crisp and clean, I'd rather them match and look a little more natural than be perfectly groomed and looked so different. For example, I think my brows look much more similar, if a little less perfect, here. I am terrible with eyebrow pencil and doubt I will get good enough in a week to feel confident doing it for my wedding, so dipbrow it must be.

If I didn't have dark circles and acne marks, I wouldn't wear concealer at all.   But it all depends on your skin tone. If you have normal, decent undereye skin, you're good, but if your undereye skin is red or patchy or dark circley, you may want to wear a little something to even out your skin tone there (that said, that doesn't mean you have to wear makeup all over your face). Something like eyeliner on eyes with reddish undereye skin and no concealer (like the Intervention look) is not really a good look."

But without that background info, it would put up some questions in my mind and I would probably assume that it didn't occur to you for some reason that you can cover the acne scars."
sugarfreemua,37nvrq,unfunnypun,1 point,Fri May 29 17:12:17 2015 UTC,"Do you mean that the makeup is causing more acne, or emphasizing the scarring/acne? If it's breaking you out, check out acnemantra.com's ingredient checker (copy/paste in the list, and it'll tell you which ingredients are comedogenic). If it's the foundation's look you don't like, I agree- check out those Lisa Eldridge tutorials on covering acne.  Remember, concealer is the real MVP when it comes to coverage- you could probably get away with covering those scars if you wanted, and not using foundation.  I love Glamoflauge. It's only at Walmart- not to promote the ""evil empire"", but, you know. It's very full coverage and surprisingly emollient, so it probably wouldn't emphasize any flaking/bad texture. Just set it, and you're....set. If Dermablend is too pricy for you.  I think the no base, just eyes/lips can look good, IF your other makeup is on point- that way it looks intentional, not like you aren't sure how to apply foundation (very, me in middle school)."

I also think lip color 1 is totally the winner! It's warmer and it coordinates beautifully with your blush. Great look!  My CC for you is to try adding a bit of bronzer to your chin and around the corners of your jaw line. That will really soften up the edges and give you a little more contour. :)"

sugarfreemua,37id3e,graft_vs_host,8,Wed May 27 22:02:57 2015 UTC,"I think everything is great. Blush, too. Remember that you're going to be photographed, so you'll want the camera to pick up the blush. The application doesn't seem too heavy. Honestly, my only CC is: perhaps darken your brows one shade to make them stand out ever so slightly more than they do now? Maybe a slight powder wash on top of the dipbrow? As far as lip goes, my vote is for the first pretty pink! Rikugien is one of my favorite colors, and I use it a lot for bridal makeup (am a MUA)."

Only suggestion there is a lighter hand with the highlighter--the bit on your chin is verging on looking oily and I think your temples are a little too shiny.  Love the blush/blush placement.  I'm a fan of the first lip color * and I think your eyeshadow looks lovely.  I'd add perhaps a little bit lighter matte shade to your browbone (and a highlighter if you're inclined, but after the matte shade), just to have continuity of shadow placement.  Or maybe blend it more?  It just looks a tiny bit abrupt.    *I forgot I had f.lux on and my screen was super orangey, so at first I was like, ""am I looking at a different lip color?

If they do grow in closer to the center and with less of an arch, I would suggest a less severely angled look.   If you are intentionally accentuating your downturned eyes, you're doing just fine. It gives you the more doe-eyed look. If you'd like to try a different eye shape sometime, maybe lose the outer undereye eyeliner.  Great job on your lips, does the color and shape stay well?

sugarfreemua,374q2g,softlikethesunset,4,Mon May 25 03:45:51 2015 UTC,"I like the strong brow, I do think you should try them a bit closer together. A good rule I've found is to line a pencil up vertically with your nose right where the nostril meets the nose, and draw them in until that point only.  I can't decide if your glasses are good for your eye shape or if it's the makeup (rad glasses though!) I'm pretty sure bringing the undereye shadow/liner in past the outer third of your eye is closing them in. Try only lining the bottom outer third, and blending to the halfway point with a lighter shadow.  Lips are perfect."

I think your brows are too far apart, and you should fill them in closer together - about half a centimeter more per side.   What I imagine will be an unpopular thought: I don't like the overall colour combination. I find the cold blush/lipstick with the warm eyeshadow makes your face feel unbalanced. I think you'd be better off either doing cold colours all over, or warm colours all over, since individually everything looks lovely (aside from the pizza lipstick, but whatevs, I get it, some things in life are more important than lipstick :p)."

sugarfreemua,36o0ps,mayamys,1 point,Wed May 27 00:09:24 2015 UTC,"I'm hesitant to recommend a specific resource because I don't think you should let a guide inhibit your creativity. I often find myself disagreeing with ""how to choose colours for your whatever""  makeup tutorials because they are just too restrictive. Instead it is best to just experiment with looks and see what looks good to you.  With all that being said, a colour wheel can help you understand what colours are warm and what colours are cool. I would argue that red and green are both neutral colours, and sometimes they can lean more towards being cool or being warm. When you choose colours for your look you can swipe them on the back of your hand first, to see how they look close together. With practice you'll develop a better eye for combining colours."
sugarfreemua,36o0ps,Nanya_business,5,Wed May 27 19:50:58 2015 UTC,"I think you've done a pretty nice job actually. I've been sitting here combing over everything trying to come up with some sort of critique and there are only a few nitpicky things I can come up with, which are this: I'd clean up just the couple stray hairs under your brows that aren't really lending to the shape, and it's kind of hard to tell but your blush placement might be just a tad low. I feel like you might be able to find a better mascara that emphasizes your lashes better too. But I really like the way you've done your eyeshadow, the color and placement is very flattering on your eyes, and I'm digging the no liner look. Your skin looks really good and I like that your freckles are showing through. How do you like that foundation, would you say it's worth the money? It looks nice."

For curling your lashes, have you tried sticking the curler in your bra while you're doing everything else? Warming it up a bit seems to help hold the curl a little better for me, and then I crimp the lashes in a few different spots up the lashes to really convince them. But lashes can be stubborn, some people's just don't like to stay curled! A different mascara might help that though. I find that waterproof ones must be more waxy or something and hold the curl better, because they seem to work better for me! And thanks for the reply about the foundation!

For the CC part, your lipstick, while a perfect color, looks a bit smudgy on your lower lip.  Maybe a lip liner?  Blush is a little low.

Your eyebrows, eyeliner, and blush are really good, and your base makeup looks natural from what I can see in the picture.   Depending on where you work, the other commenter could be right about the lipstick being a little too bright. I think the color suits you though! I like the shape as well. It reminds me of a very vintage 20's feeling lipstick, and I think it flatters your face.  The thing that caught my eye is the highlighter in the inner under corners. I think it's a little too bright. A slightly darker/more subtle highlighter would make this look a bit more mature/grown-up/office-appropriate.   Overall, I think it's really cute, and the choices you've made flatter your face shape and coloring. And if you work somewhere really casual, I actually really like the color and shade choices."

I'd think something with a little more plum or even brown would suit your skin better. Application wise, it doesn't seem to adhere to your natural peaks on the upper lip. It can be hard to match the angles properly, lol, so perhaps just some practice?"

My eyebrows look like scheiße conpared to yours. :) my only CC would be that personally,  I think your blush placement is a bit too low."

sugarfreemua,36icgf,FierceMamaCat,2,Tue May 19 20:21:56 2015 UTC,"The symmetry of your brows is fine! I'd just avoid shading the first little bit of them in the middle, to make them look more natural."
sugarfreemua,36icgf,atom_eyes,1 point,Fri May 22 21:52:50 2015 UTC,"The eyeshadow looks beautiful with your eye color, my only cc on that would be to take the lid color up a little higher so you can see more of it when your eyes are open."

sugarfreemua,36eye1,HDaveThoreauAway,4,Mon May 18 21:28:39 2015 UTC,"You have a really nice natural brow shape and thickness, as well as really nice skin, so I'd probably start off with a bit of a ""less is more"" attitude and try a bb cream/tinted moisturizer/light coverage foundation (I'd recommend one with a somewhat dewy finish) along with some concealer for redness. As for brows, I agree to just groom them a little to get rid of the strays and add crispness to the tail, and then maybe use a clear or tinted brow gel to hold them in place. I feel like they go a bit too far in towards your nose as well, so I'd recommend plucking just the tiniest, tiniest amount there. Again, I agree with the other comment on pairing a neutral shadow with some dark, voluminous curled lashes, and I'd also suggest tightlining just to give some subtle, workplace appropriate emphasis to your eyes. My next suggestion kinda departs from the whole super professional thing, but I think you would look really, really nice in a warm berry toned lipcolor or even a dramatic plummy blush, as you have a high contrast sort of color palette happening already with your haircolor/skintone, so you could pull off some pretty saturated colors (NARS Audrey comes to mind)"
sugarfreemua,36eye1,mostlyqueer,1 point,Tue May 19 07:00:26 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your response! I looked up NARS Audrey and it's not too crazy for my workplace, I'll have to check it out."
sugarfreemua,36eye1,quinniewynn,3,Tue May 19 15:17:51 2015 UTC,"If I were you...  First- light skin and dark hair doesn't have to look ""unmanaged"". The shape you had in your made up picture I found a little heavy towards the centre. You have a good natural shape and that's a great starting point. Brow make up can be used to fill in the patchy areas and even them out a bit. I'd clean them up a bit as far as strays go. Those hairs on top of you brow not really in the ""brow"" itself but hovering above I'd get rid of. I'd clean up the underneath as well just to get more of a point towards the end. Nothing drastic- more just maintenance, shaping, and filling in.   For my new face I would couture my nose a little, give the illusion of a thinner nose towards the bottom. Highlight centre with something like Milk and contour with a darker colour on the sides of the nose. Since the job setting is formal a MLBB colour would work well as a lip colour. Nothing to crazy, but something to accent the natural pink already possessed.   There seems to been some ruddiness (sp??) on and around your nose, so I would invest in a well matched foundation and if you want, concealer as well.   Play up eyes a little with some neutral eyeshadow and dark, curling mascara- it looks like your lashes could use a good curl and they might need some help with that.   Blush in a tone to compliment your lips.   That's what I would do.    Makeup inspo for new me"

Maybe you could design your own MAC or Inglot pallette? What kind of colors are you looking for? Smokey or completely natural? Matte or shimmer?  Also purples always look great on deeper tones! Kat Von D LUV is my favorite purple lipstick. You could also look into getting some lip tars so you can custom make your own lip colors, colors like Hootchie Lydia and Sebastian would be great!"

The Mac eye shadow pallets in Burgandy times Nine and Purple times nine might be a good place to start looking as it has flattering shades of both a few browns browns and purples. You can also buy the colors as separates which might actually be more cost effective, since a few of the colors will probably be a bit too light.

Nars seduction (a beautiful wine color) nars liberte (a terracotta) Lips: deep red like mac diva, a purple-wine like mac rebel, a nude like mac taupe.

sugarfreemua,36afdu,mississippijones,41,Sun May 17 19:23:20 2015 UTC,"I gotta say your whole look is very  messy. The colors are funky which I assume you were going for, but you should find funky colors that suit you better and apply them a little more thin. I'd go for a softer, less purple lipstick and the brows are thick/not shaped particularly in any form.   Edit: sorry on my phone and can't go back and forth to pics. The light blue and eyeliner go well but I'd change your upper lip color and blend more. What brands did you use? I don't know if anything is on your cheeks?"
sugarfreemua,36afdu,KittenImmaculate,22,Mon May 18 02:17:43 2015 UTC,"To me the colours aren't really working well. I like the. As separates but together they turn me off a little. I think it's the red eye and violet lips.   As for your eyebrows I think a big issue is clean up. I'd first start by making sure your brow starts where your eye starts. Then arches towards the otter corner of your eye, finally tapering to a point. When your done clean your lines a little- as yours look a little fuzzy. Sometimes I use a baby wipe pulled across my finger nail to remove any makeup I don't want, then finish with some concealer on a fine brush to make my edges sharper.   Good luck! Hope you had fun!"
sugarfreemua,36afdu,quinniewynn,2,Mon May 18 00:36:12 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Try to get colors that are based in the same color family. For example, in this look, your eyeshadow is more warm and red based while your lipstick is cool and blue based. Try and match them to keep the look congruent. :-)"

sugarfreemua,36afdu,quinniewynn,12,Tue May 19 05:33:15 2015 UTC,"I'm assuming this was the end of the night, given the lighting and he creasing?   Because of both of those, I'm only going to address your brows.   They look to be the correct colour (given the lighting issues) and I quite like the shape of them on you. However, they look quite one dimensional and painted on, I think a much lighter hand and slightly thinner tails will leave you with good, strong brows that complement your features and look more natural and less distracting."
sugarfreemua,36afdu,P_Grammicus,6,Sun May 17 21:21:51 2015 UTC,"For brows I'd say use a spoolie to brush through any excess product and set them with a clear brow gel to keep stray hairs in place.  Also I don't think that the eyeliner is the most flattering for your eye shape, I'd keep it slightly thinner across the lash line (especially focusing on tightlining) and wing it to a sharper point. Using an eyeshadow primer and then laying a skin colored shadow down before applying any liner or shadow may help prevent creasing throughout the night.   I like the overall look, I think the white liner gives it a kind of arty vibe. :)"
sugarfreemua,36afdu,EnvyAdams,8,Mon May 18 01:35:05 2015 UTC,"Be sure you're taking your brows as into the middle as you're supposed to. They feel a little spread apart right now.  The way you're doing your eye makeup is lovely, but isn't complementing your eyes as much as it could be. Your eyeliner is very thick, which is fine, but keeping it thick towards the inner corner leaves them looking a bit on the small side.  This part is more of a personal preference, but I'd maybe go a little less intense with the white underneath. Maybe a light brown or gray, or just keeping the white closer to the eye. If course, if you prefer the intensity then who am I to stop you?  Overall a lovely look :) I really love your blending and color choice. Your base is fantastic!"

sugarfreemua,36afdu,missmisfit,1 point,Mon May 18 19:00:16 2015 UTC,"I really like the lip color, but it is just a bit too much paired with the eyeshadow going all the way to the brow and the under eye. Typically, it's safer to do a bold lip + neutral eye or a bright eye with a neutral lip. If you want to do a bold eye with a bold lip, application almost has to be perfect or it might end up looking like badly executed drag.   Your eyelids have a lot of space, so I think this look would be a lot more cohesive if the eyeshadow stayed closer to your lids, and the orange could be paired with a mauve color in the crease. Also, definitely do some high-light on your brow bone, as it will help with making your eyebrows look more neat. I'd recommend also doing white on your water line instead of the silver eyeshadow underneath your eyes.   And for the brows, I think they'd be better if they were allowed to grow in the middle a bit more, and then more square in the front. Right now they look a little bit over plucked in that area, and it makes your nose bridge seem larger than it is."

sugarfreemua,363dkw,Rhesuspieces,3,Fri May 15 19:34:13 2015 UTC,"Your brows do look a little ashy, but it's not too noticeable. I started using my contour as a brow fill and it worked wonderfully (because the color is neutral but on the skin color spectrum, which makes it warm--I use NYX Taupe). So you could try that on your day off.  Your eyeshadow goes a little high out of the crease, jut blend it more and try to keep it more in the crease. I see you're looking for eyeshadow, a cheap option is Wet n Wild, they're soft and moderately pigmented, and cheap. And you should try to tightline your lashes, at least the top ones, especially when using black liner.  Your contour bronzer is very red-toned. Try a shade more in the neutral/brown variety (should be just a shade of two darker than your skin, not too much).   I love your lip color, and the blush is nice."
sugarfreemua,363dkw,softlikethesunset,4,Mon May 18 19:39:23 2015 UTC,"Here's my unprofessional cc.   Face looks good, blush looks good (could potentially go a touch more but I just really like the rouge), liner looks good, I would say maybe a smidgen lighter on the under eye concealer...I personally think you're going a bit high with the crease color so make sure to really keep the color in your eye crease. And your brows, (I'm on mobile so I can't tell by looking back), but I don't remember if you said you used any product. If you'd like to continue with no product, I highly suggest taking a q-tip and removing the foundation/powder that's on them. Makes them look very muted.   I personally don't use brow specific product. I use dark brown eyeshadow from a random dollar store pallet. Maybe see what dark shadows you have if you feel like playing. :)  Again, take my suggestions with a grain of salt as I'm not a professional."

I'm usually better at checking to make sure I don't have product on them, oops!). I've always been too scared to touch them in fear of looking like Groucho Marx, and because they're so dark and thick I wasn't sure if filling them in with a more auburn color would look crazy."

There doesn't seem to be any saturation of color. But it doesn't have that light ""no-make-up-make-up"" look either. It just looks like you're afraid of your makeup. Work on putting down a layer of skin colored powder, then blend into that, building from light to dark.   Some blush would give your face color, you look very washed out."

They feel very 'wet' like a smear of syrup to me. Perhaps a tinted balm might be more your thing to get used to a lip product?
sugarfreemua,3637y0,Seuripub,1 point,Sat May 16 05:06:52 2015 UTC,"Start with Lisa Eldridge and watch all of her beginner level how-to videos. Don't bother with anyone else until you've finished her first. She's the most comprehensive and easy to understand. She'll teach the basics that isn't too much at once and you can go at your pace.  I'd agree you don't really need mascara; your lashes are dark. I'd maybe focus on an eyeshadow palette and eyeliner, if that's something you might like. A good MLBB shade is a good start as well.  Eventually, a good red lip and maybe a base product, but make sure you have a good skincare routine first and foremost. If you don't have one already, start now. And moreover, don't let the sales associates at Sephora/Ulta/etc. tell you about what will be best for you on that front. They're great for makeup knowledge, but your skin is an organ and they're trained to sell, not treat. Go to /r/skincareaddicts and get a routine there, it's intended for beginners and very friendly."
sugarfreemua,3637y0,dutchesse,1 point,Fri May 15 20:50:39 2015 UTC,Hm. A foundation can be around $30-40ish by itself.   Though you could get an eyeliner (stila stay all day/kat von d tattoo eyeliners are both popular) and an eyeshadow palette for around that price. What kind of eyeshadow do you want? Matte or shimmery and what type of colors. You could do eyeliner + naked basics maybe + 1 lipgloss and be around $60.

sugarfreemua,35wuq9,manicmoon,32,Thu May 14 04:24:20 2015 UTC,"First of all: DO NOT TOUCH THOSE BROWS, MY DEAR! PICK UP A TWEEZERS AND YOU WILL NEVER HEAR THE END OF IT FROM ME! Your brows are a fantastic shape and thickness, they suit your face so perfectly. The straightish shape they have is soon-to-be extremely sought after, I'm fairly sure. Keep them as they are! Dipbrow is a great product once you get the hang of it, and just the slightest amount can really add some drama to already thick brows (I'm in the same boat as you, but mine are a bit more angular). What you've done here with it is really great.   I'm honestly shocked that foundation isn't on your list. You have great skin. I think adding a blush (I prefer cream blushes) would take your look to the next level. A burgundy like Maybelline's Dream Bouncy blush in Plum Wine would be great, especially after seeing that lipcolor on you. It looks like you are sort of warm-leaning as far as undertones go, rosey and pinky-coral blush would look good too.   Other than that, I think this is pretty great for beginner makeup. Keep up the good work! Hopefully this was helpful :)"
sugarfreemua,35wuq9,bunny-hill,7,Thu May 14 07:01:58 2015 UTC,"I've been wanting to make my eyebrows more arched/thin but reading what you just said has made me consider otherwise.

sugarfreemua,35wuq9,Mascara_of_Zorro,10,Thu May 14 11:28:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah don't thin them out. They suit you very well and really balance your face out with your lips. If that makes sense?   I mean you could shape sliiightly IMO,  but it's not needed really"
sugarfreemua,35wuq9,creamcheesefiasco,2,Thu May 14 11:31:19 2015 UTC,"My opinion on eyebrow arches: If they arch naturally, go ahead and arch them some more! If they don't arch naturally/are naturally more straight, keep them on the straight side because you might completely fuck up your brows or if you do get them arched, the upkeep of having highly arched brows will be time consuming to maintain.  I believe whatever eyebrow shape someone naturally has is the proper eyebrow shape for their face shape and eyes.   Right now, you have a very nice shape for your face and your brows are currently on-trend, so leave them alone (other than cleaning them up)!"
sugarfreemua,35wuq9,dicks4nickels,3,Thu May 14 13:38:46 2015 UTC,"I agree with the other posts on here, don't change the shape of your brows. My only recommendation would be to brush them up and out with a brow gel.  You have nice skin, you could get away with something that has light coverage like a bb cream.  I think you could curl your lashes before mascara. You could apply mascara on your bottom lashes as well."
sugarfreemua,35wuq9,coralto,5,Thu May 14 23:28:50 2015 UTC,"You don't need foundation! Your skin is lovely. If you really want something, maybe just a light dusting of powder?  You have gorgeous lips, have you tried using a lipliner though? It helps get that precise level of application that makes you look pro. Also, since they're such a great feature of yours, go ahead and play with colors!"
sugarfreemua,35wuq9,MrsLovettsMeatPie,3,Thu May 14 09:11:30 2015 UTC,"Ah thank you! I have the ELF HD Studio Powder but every time I put it on, it leaves a white cast over me... Same with concealer/foundation. Haven't really gotten used to using all-over products yet. What powder would you recommend? :)  I have a red lip liner that I use but I didn't draw it on this time round. Applying lipstick/liner is a bit of a trouble for me since my lip is very pigmented... What lipsticks/liners would you recommend? :) Thank you!!"
sugarfreemua,35wuq9,coralto,2,Thu May 14 11:31:37 2015 UTC,I'd keep searching until you found a good brand that suits your skin tone. Sounds like you're going a powder that's too light for your skin! And keep in mind that skin tones change throughout the year so you'll always have to be on your toes.
sugarfreemua,35wuq9,KittenImmaculate,2,Thu May 14 12:35:37 2015 UTC,"I'm just getting into lipstick myself, and learning about liner made my application look so much more professional. I haven't tested many formulas so I can't really recommend any, but I recently got a waterproof sephora liner because it was the best match for my lips and it's got good staying power.   As for powder: when I said powder, I meant a tinted one that matches your skin, so that it gently evens out your skintone while maintaining a more natural look than a foundation would. I use the Bare Minerals one, it's nice and light and has good ingredients but is still affordable. The ELF one is made with silica which is EXTREMELY drying, yuck.   The best advice, though, is to GET SAMPLES. Go and get matched in the store, but also get one darker and one lighter and test them on your face later. Wear each for a day and check how it looks in daylight and artificial lighting. Good luck!"
sugarfreemua,35wuq9,bixvix,2,Thu May 14 21:37:52 2015 UTC,Your eyes look great. I was going to say to change the lip color but I didn't realize your last pic had a dark shade... And it suits you very nicely. Good job!
sugarfreemua,35wuq9,mistlet03,2,Thu May 14 17:29:39 2015 UTC,"your skin is pretty much flawless, so you could not wear foundation for your everyday face. my take is: i'd get a concealer just to brighten up and not so much to conceal (i.e. under eyes) and apply another coat of mascara. wearing just a concealer or a corrector is super lightweight."
sugarfreemua,35wuq9,mistlet03,2,Thu May 14 22:48:06 2015 UTC,"It looks to me like you have warm peachy/slightly yellow undertones, and I agree that you could definitely pull off not wearing foundation. If you really want to wear something, maybe a tinted moisturiser or a sheer BB cream would be an option, they tend to be a bit more forgiving if you can't find exactly the right shade.   I agree that your brows look great as they are, you don't need to touch them. They suit your face very well. Your liner is a great thickness even if one of the wings is a little longer than the other (personally I think the shorter one looks better on you) and I can't see anything wrong with the blending on your eyeshadow. That lipstick is absolutely gorgeous.   If you hadn't mentioned you were a newbie I would have had no idea, you look great!"

I suggest checking the HG lists in the sidebar to get an idea of what other people like and then going into a store to swatch a little bit of the colour on your neck if they have testers- matching foundations/BB creams to your neck rather than your hand usually gives you a better match for your face.

I think they would frame your eyes a little better if they were a smidgen (a smidge!) farther apart.   Actually, I really like the way you've done your brows.

sugarfreemua,35v2k1,mostlyqueer,1 point,Thu May 14 01:13:39 2015 UTC,Thank you! I actually just got them threaded and they did all the shaping. I had to grow them out for ~1 month because my previous shaping attempts went really wrong. I also got the impression that they were a tinnnny bit too close so I'll work on that next time!
sugarfreemua,35ryk4,WintarMeadows,31,Wed May 13 00:36:33 2015 UTC,"The next time you post, it would be much much more helpful if you just included full face pictures, rather than these far away ones. It's next to impossible to offer any serious cc when the texture of your skin, etc can't be seen.   Firstly, I have a comment that's not makeup related, but you did mention it and I hope it will help you a bit. I did diagnostic imaging for years, which involves trying to get as perfect a midline as possible when it comes to imaging skulls.  I have looked at thousands of faces, close up, whilst trying to position them properly and I can assure you, you don't have a highly asymmetrical face. No one has a perfectly symmetrical one, and while I can see asymmetry once you pointed it out it was not something that jumped out at me, even now. I would never had noticed had you not mentioned it. I know that it's probably really glaring to you (I know mine is to me), but please trust a stranger on the Internet - it's not going to bother anyone else.   Anyway, I only have cc on your brows. I really like the shape and think it's a great one for you, however the way they are filled in makes them look out of focus compared to the rest of your features. I'm not suggested power brows, but I think a cleaner line, achieved both by shaping and filling them, would allow them to frame your eyes, which are lovely, more and bring out the angles in your face somewhat.   I also love that lip colour on you, and your face makeup seems to be the correct match."
sugarfreemua,35ryk4,P_Grammicus,3,Wed May 13 01:15:31 2015 UTC,"Okay, sorry! I guess it never occurred to me that it's hard to really see. I'll definitely include up-close phone selfies next time :) Oh woah, that sounds really interesting! But thank you, I've always been insecure about it, but I think it's mainly because I have scars on the left side of my face too, and no visible jawline on my left side unless i contour. Thank you! I'll try to work on them. What products do you suggest? My current brow pencils are so hard to work with! They's so light and only works by blurring."
sugarfreemua,35ryk4,P_Grammicus,4,Thu May 14 04:42:43 2015 UTC,"Okay, I know you've been getting a lot of this, and I am not completely comfortable getting into a discussion about other people's self image, but you're not going to be able to improve your skills without a somewhat realistic attitude about your face. People who don't have visible jawlines don't have visible jawline because they've had cancer or a terrible accident and have lost part of their jaw. I am positive that is not the case with you.  I think your greatest challenge here is that you're not looking at your features with a critical eye, but rather a distorted one. If all you are attempting to do is to fix problems you see, even if no one else does, you're not going to be happy with the result, because makeup isn't going to do that.   So the first thing I'd suggest is for you to look closely and identify at least three things you really like about your face, what you consider your best features, and think about ways to emphasize those.  I could give you my opinion what those are, but my opinion doesn't matter, it's what you care about, what makes you happy in your features that will make it easier for you to move forward. Because results are much more positive when positive things are emphasized rather than just trying to fix stuff that's disliked.   I started learning to do my brows using a matte powder and an angled brush. I saw elsewhere that you don't have any brushes, and so the first thing I'd suggest is a few good tools, they don't need to be pricey but they are essential - you can't build a house without a hammer! The angled brush and powder thing makes for a pretty natural result and is fairly easy to learn to work with, and also allows you to use cheapie shadows until you find a colour that works. However, it can get a little blurry by nature so you'd have to keep that in mind if you choose that.   The other option is a pencil, and I would recommend for you to consider a fine eyebrow pencil that is like a mechanical pencil rather than one you sharpen manually. The Anastasia Brow Wiz is probably the best known of this type, but there are lots of others at different price points available. These allow for a lot of precision, and the point stays consistent, which many prefer.   Regardless of what you choose, I'd suggest you look at some brow tutorials to see some different techniques. There are some listed in the sidebar of /r/makeupaddiction that are quite good, take a look and try some of the techniques out. Personally, I'm a bottom line drawer and then I pull up the colour to where I want it, but I'm going for a very natural look. Other people fill in hair by hair, others shape and fill their brows to look very bold, this is all going to depend on what you like best and what you prefer aesthetically. Play around and see what you like!"

I never realized that I was using makeup in all the wrong ways. It's way too easy to slip into self-hate! I'm working on getting brushes, so until I do, I'll just hold off on the things that I need them for, ahhah. That is really helpful though, thanks! I'll be sure to check out MUA's guides. Also, if you have experience with eyeliner, do you know of any good eyeliners that won't smear? So far, all the eyeliners I've tried (really just pencil and gel, but I've also tried REALLY cheap liquid eyeliner) ends up all over my eyebags and makes me look more tired than anything."

sugarfreemua,35ryk4,BakedBeauty,9,Thu May 14 04:43:36 2015 UTC,"I'm not so keen on the brows, but I can't really tell if it's the photo/lighting or not. They appear too thick at the top of the curve in comparison to the inner part of your brows. I'm not saying you should go full 2000's thin brow, but just slightly thinned at the top of the curve. I'd also suggest a less ""blurry"" brow. Compared to the rest of your features they look as if they are out of focus almost. This can be helped by reducing the amount you are blending while filling in the brows.   I'd also suggest maybe a blush. Blush application can actually help to slim the face (as you mentioned was something you wanted to accomplish), if done right. For you I'd suggest applying the blush along the cheekbones and sweep upwards rather than focusing on the apples of your cheeks."

If you look at your side view pictures, it's very obvious where you started applying your mascara on your lashes. As a fellow blonde, I understand the struggle. I just get realllllllllllyyyyy close to my lash roots and wiggle the mascara wand all the way up the lashes.   Other than that I love this look! Very beautiful yet understated, perfect for a bridesmaid. Hope this helps :)"
sugarfreemua,353cz0,panda_burrr,4,Wed May 6 22:49:39 2015 UTC,"Combination of both, probably. I NEVER wear black mascara, so this was very new to me. I think I didn't apply it how I normally would. Tightlining is usually so much better but my pencil is down to nothing and so hard to use at this point haha! I bought a new one today, so we'll see how that helps! Thank you for the critique!"
sugarfreemua,353cz0,panda_burrr,4,Thu May 7 04:11:27 2015 UTC,"I have light eyelashes too, and I have found the only reason not to get in deep to the root and wiggle it out is fear of clumps. Using a clean spoolie brush after applying the mascara separates the lashes and keeps them from looking spidery. So with my secret spoolie in hand, I'm never afraid to start at the base of the lash so they look defined and clean."
sugarfreemua,353cz0,curlyhairedsheep,1 point,Thu May 7 06:38:18 2015 UTC,"Eyes open is great! I think the wings could use a little bit of a sharper shape if that makes sense. Are you planning on falsies? Light lashes or maybe half falsies would look great! Also, highlight highlight highlight. If you already have, use a lil bit of a cooler color."
sugarfreemua,353cz0,roo129,1 point,Thu May 7 02:36:22 2015 UTC,"I didn't highlight or contour at all. I should do both. What's a good highlighter? Any come to mind for my coloring? And yes to lashes. I had them with me, too, I just completely forgot to put them on! I'll try again to make these changes and see how the lashes work with it!"
sugarfreemua,353cz0,coralto,1 point,Thu May 7 04:13:24 2015 UTC,"NARS Illuminator in Copacabana, The Balm Mary Lou-Manizer, or Becca Shimmering Skin Perfecter in Opal would look great on you. Plus, you can mix the liquid ones into your foundation for a bit of glow. They're not cheap, but highlight is one of those products that lasts forever."
sugarfreemua,352qc7,FTWgirl,25,Wed May 6 16:44:14 2015 UTC,Lip color is perfect. I really like the eyeshadow too. My only critique is your under eyes. Not sure if the under eye concealer is not a great choice or if you have eyeshadow fallout but that area is not blending with the rest of your skin. Congratulations!
sugarfreemua,352qc7,missmisfit,6,Wed May 6 16:55:42 2015 UTC,I'm mostly concerned with that too...do you think it's too light?
sugarfreemua,352qc7,missmisfit,10,Wed May 6 17:00:17 2015 UTC,Not too sure but I'm pale and very blue under my eyes too and for the best results I mix Physician's Formula yellow concealer with Laura Geller Real Deal Concealer in light. I put a little of each on the back of my hand and mix them together with a concealer brush (which I then use to apply it). If I use concealer only the blue shows through and if I use the yellow only it looks too yellow.
sugarfreemua,352qc7,tits_mcgee0123,9,Wed May 6 17:21:59 2015 UTC,"Congrats!  You might want to try a peachy color corrector under your concealer (and maybe a different concealer) for your under eyes. It's a super tough area to deal with, I have hereditary dark circles and they suck. I use the Bobbi Brown corrector and concealer, but there are other good options out there too. I think NYX has some corrector options, and lots of people seem to like the NARS and Benefit concealers. I like the BB stuff because the counter I go to has SAs that are amazing with color and they were able to match me easily to the right tones, and nothing else I've tried has worked better for my skin.  Otherwise, I think your lip color is perfect and I love your eyeshadow! For pictures you might want to try some falsies and/or a tad more blush, but those things are completely optional and look good as they are too."
sugarfreemua,352qc7,tits_mcgee0123,5,Wed May 6 19:01:21 2015 UTC,"Thank you! I have a yellow under eye concealer from NYX, I will try that and maybe a different concealer. I have a MAC pro longwear concealer that might work better. Thanks so much for the advice :)"
sugarfreemua,352qc7,HotSauceHigh,1 point,Wed May 6 19:17:42 2015 UTC,Yeah no problem!
sugarfreemua,352qc7,HotSauceHigh,10,Wed May 6 20:53:40 2015 UTC,"Beautiful! Try bringing your brows in towards your nose more, especially your right one. Try contouring your forehead and using a less clumpy mascara (try Clump Crusher) maybe use some lashes so they show up in the pro photos."
sugarfreemua,352qc7,HotSauceHigh,2,Wed May 6 17:34:51 2015 UTC,Thank you! I actually am having a really strange problem with my right eyebrow. It's receding back and it's been really hard trying to draw it in naturally. I have no idea why it's happening. Thank you for the CC though. I will try all of that.
sugarfreemua,352qc7,IAmSecretlyACat,3,Wed May 6 17:38:10 2015 UTC,Try using an angled brush and powder or a lighter twist up pencil with short strokes
sugarfreemua,352qc7,HotSauceHigh,2,Wed May 6 19:39:03 2015 UTC,Also you could try some growth stimulating serum. European Wax Center has one.
sugarfreemua,352qc7,peanut_jam,2,Wed May 6 19:39:58 2015 UTC,Thanks! I have been using a NYX brow pencil in taupe but the color is still a little too warm. I don't want to spend a ton on it but I may have to. Any color suggestions?
sugarfreemua,352qc7,mybffndmyothrrddt,1 point,Wed May 6 19:59:03 2015 UTC,Dipbrow just released a taupe shade in addition to their already kinda ashy blonde shade. You could try that if you're open to dipbrow.

sugarfreemua,34yao8,fading_fad,5,Tue May 5 16:43:46 2015 UTC,sorry!
sugarfreemua,34yao8,candywax,18,Wed May 6 03:35:25 2015 UTC,"I think you made a good start! I think heavy eyeliner without mascara looks really undone. So I would definitely start with some mascara and maybe curling your lashes. Then, I think a warm blush would look great. Then lips! Maybe a MLBB shade?"
sugarfreemua,34yao8,dicks4nickels,12,Tue May 5 17:14:10 2015 UTC,"some mascara will definitely pull your look together. doesn't really matter the kind, but i would go with black mascara to go with your bold eyeliner.  also i wanted to say good job on your eyebrow and eyeliner shape, they look great!"
sugarfreemua,34yao8,dicks4nickels,4,Tue May 5 21:05:36 2015 UTC,"I always have the same routine that takes about 8-10 minutes (with hair, but my hair is easy)  products:    Covergirl compact powder in Translucent Medium Revlon Colorstay liquid liner in Blackest Black Anastasia Brow pencil thingy in Dark Brown   aaand that's it. I tried foundation but it feels gross and I prefer to be able to sweat at work or outside and not feel like my face is falling apart."
sugarfreemua,34yao8,musicmuse1122,4,Tue May 5 15:55:36 2015 UTC,"Your brows look great! You could use blush, highlighter, and mascara to complete this look.  Congrats on getting the tail of your eyeliner so sharp, that can be hard to do when you're starting out. I would just say to bring the start down a little bit, it should be a continuation of your lower lashline."
sugarfreemua,34yao8,zonko_rose,2,Tue May 5 22:12:11 2015 UTC,"how does one apply highlighter/what does it do and where do I find it in the drug stores? That sounds silly as I typed it...   Also, blush always was intimidating because I remember my mom using it and it always aged her quite a bit. Like 10 years+... Maybe hers was too dark or something. I guess I could try a light color first? Colors and what matches my skin are totally beyond me :(   Also also, thanks everyone for the advice and CC :D! Definitely curling/mascara-ing my lashes tomorrow~"
sugarfreemua,34yao8,musicmuse1122,2,Wed May 6 03:37:06 2015 UTC,"Blush will definitely age you if you apply too much. Use a light hand with only a little product.  For makeup info I like to watch YouTube tutorials. Search for ""highlighter tips"" or ""how to highlight"" and there should be a bunch of videos to learn from! ELF has a nice baked highlighter as well as the Fergie line from Wet n Wild."
sugarfreemua,34yao8,zonko_rose,1 point,Wed May 6 04:32:45 2015 UTC,I should mention that I wear those glasses 24/7 because I can't see shit; I literally never take them off. That's probably why I never bothered with mascara- didn't think anyone would be able to tell behind the lenses if I did put some on :P
sugarfreemua,34yao8,musicmuse1122,2,Wed May 6 04:51:34 2015 UTC,"I wear glasses all the time too and I find I can actually put on more mascara if I'm wearing glasses than if I'm wearing contacts.  E.g., I wouldn't do my lower lashes if I were wearing contacts but it looks great under glasses."
sugarfreemua,34yao8,zonko_rose,2,Wed May 6 15:33:16 2015 UTC,Do you not have an issue with your eyelashes touching the lens of the glasses and getting them mascara-y? That was an issue I had before I wore contacts more often.
sugarfreemua,34yao8,musicmuse1122,1 point,Wed May 6 15:44:03 2015 UTC,I guess my eyelashes are not that long? Or they are naturally pretty curly?  I had that issue with the maybelline mascara that comes in the pink and green tube but once I switched to covergirl (the green and purple tubes with the bulging middle) I haven't had that issue.
sugarfreemua,34yao8,musicmuse1122,1 point,Wed May 6 15:51:31 2015 UTC,"fair enough, it may also be an issue with the brands I use because I'm pretty skint so I've had issues with lots of cheap/clumpy mascaras."
sugarfreemua,34yao8,musicmuse1122,2,Wed May 6 17:03:32 2015 UTC,"I only use drugstore mascaras!  buy a volume one, not a lengthening one, and consider using an eyelash curler.  I got one at walgreens from tweezerman brand, it's pretty decent, but I am kind of afraid of it..."
sugarfreemua,34yao8,cuddlewench,1 point,Wed May 6 17:45:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah eyelash curlers terrify me slightly. I have dyspraxia and I'm worried I'd maul my eyes out or something. I may make sure I use volume ones next time though, thanks."

sugarfreemua,34yao8,cuddlewench,1 point,Wed May 6 15:33:27 2015 UTC,I think your eyeliner wings are fabulous.  I also think your eyebrows could be a little thinner in the center of your face as they seem to be narrowing/lengthening your face a bit.  Also making them a little less blocky at the bridge of the nose will help with that.  That lipstick is a great color on you! (Edit: Are you wearing lipstick? the product list doesn't show it...)
