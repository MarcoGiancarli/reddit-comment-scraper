No messy ""but I thought he died"" needed. ""I assigned a team of trusted agents to rebuild SHIELD from the ground up, to be what SHIELD was meant to be."" Moviegoers think he's talking about Skye, TV watchers know he's talking about Coulson, comic book nerds are satisfied because it happened in the comics.   Then SHIELD is back in the universe, and they can cameo TV characters in the movies, move characters off the show into the movies, or even just use SHIELD without using the show characters (a la season 1)."

They could just do a scene near the end that show's Cap and Stark getting on again, at the Avengers facility, all made up after the civil war, and they have a meeting with Fury, and Coulson is just there.

Coulson: ""I got better.  Tahiti is a magical place.""  Boom, done.  /u/Hellstormer has another great scenario above.  Whedon just didn't want to deal with intertwining them that closely.

Watchers of the show will understand some events differently, but watchers of the movies alone will not. I don't think you will have the films referencing anything explicit from the show. If you only follow the movies, Fury just knew some guys, had a network. Within the narrative of the films, yes, SHIELD is dead, as is Coulson. It very clearly seems to be the case that AoS can work itself in and around the plots of the films, but the plots of the films are not going to go to any length to incorporate or make reference to AoS."
shield,3dzl90,NinjaPixies,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:46:24 2015 UTC,"I am not 100% certain of this, but didn't AoS come about in part due to Clark Greggs popularity in the films, even in small doses? I mean they un-killed him for the show. So to me it would be dumb to not bring him back into the films in some capacity.  So yes, I think they will work at least Coulson into the films at some point before, or during Infinity War. As for the rest of our crew, I am not holding my breath, but I've said it before, I would love to see them pop in as cameos, even if they are just background as a nod to those of us that are following SHIELD."

It would be awesome though if he did along with the team."
shield,3dzl90,The_Whole_World,-1,Mon Jul 20 23:02:54 2015 UTC,No way and heres my rant of why. Marvel is pretty much sweeping AoS under the rug and away from the rest of the MCU. In the season 2 finale Skye describes keeping the secret warriors team anonymous. I feel this is Marvel's way of making sure that AoS stays in it's little corner of the MCU and they can give the excuse to why AoS can't cross over with the films. Marvel can say that it's the team's job to be as secret as possible and not have any mention outside of it's own show. Think about it if  no one outside the show mentions them do they truly exist?
shield,3dzl90,anusacrobat,2,Tue Jul 21 03:15:40 2015 UTC,I get your point but AoS works with out being mentioned in the rest of the MCU because it is supposed to secret. That is SHIELD's MO which is to work from the shadows and be spies. They don't need the rest of the MCU it can stand on it's  own.

shield,3dw3ec,anusacrobat,3,Tue Jul 21 05:20:15 2015 UTC,"Funny, I seem to have the opposite opinion. I think Skye is a lot more interesting than Daisy in the comics. Daisy doesn't have a lot of interesting aspects other than her powers and the fact that she's the only shield agent other than Fury to have level 10 clearance. Whereas Skye has a tragic backstory with her parents and how she eventually joins shield because of how she respects and looks up to Coulson and the rest of the team.  Ultimately, I think the TV incarnation of Daisy is much more well-rounded and defined as a character because of the creative liberties they've added to make her more interesting."

Besides the level 10 clearance you mentioned, and being the person Nick Fury trusts the most, she:   is a daughter of a super villain.

shield,3dw3ec,anusacrobat,3,Tue Jul 21 14:14:46 2015 UTC,"I have actually and while Skye shares a lot of inspiration from Daisy in the comics, I feel like the show has done a much better job of making her interesting and well-rounded. Things like her relationship with her father were so damn good that they actually shoehorned Mr. Hyde to be more like his TV counterpart in the recent SHIELD comic.    I'm not saying I don't like the character in the comics, but I just think Skye is slightly more interesting and well-rounded than her comic book counterpart."

shield,3dtb6o,Hawkguy67,17,Sun Jul 19 06:32:49 2015 UTC,"I feel sorry for Ward in that he suffered abuse and trauma in his childhood that moulded him and that Garrett (who probably was well aware of this) then further manipulated him for his own purposes. His past is really quite tragic but it does bother me that Ward has never taken responsibility for his own actions and I think that is necessary for redemption. There are signs sometimes that he cared about the team but then there are times when the opposite is true. In S2 he shrugged dismissively when Whitehall told him the Bus was shot down with May and Tripp and others on board and it was heavily suggested he killed the innocent scientist who fixed Kara's face and he tried to kill Bobbi, May (when he accidentally shot Kara) and potentially Hunter in the finale. I don't hate him, his character is one of the best aspects of the show, but his actions are too deliberate to pass off as misunderstood"
shield,3dtb6o,Addy6,13,Sun Jul 19 07:52:03 2015 UTC,"One of my biggest pet-peeves of some of the fans of this show is that they blame all of wards ‘bad’ actions on his past and the fact that he was abused. Yes, it’s really shitty that he was, but that’s not a reason to go and kill people etc. Most people who have been abused don’t go on to kill numerous innocent people, so in some way it was his action, and his choice to do it. In order to ever be redeemed, ward needs to accept that he personally made those choices, and he wasn’t ‘forced’ to do most of what he was done. And considering what happened at the end of season 2, that seems very far off."
shield,3dtb6o,k1rra,10,Sun Jul 19 08:08:50 2015 UTC,"Yes, as May says, they have all had their traumas and it didn't make them into psychopaths. Arguably Skye who also had a very tragic childhood chose to be 'good'"
shield,3dtb6o,Addy6,10,Sun Jul 19 09:15:16 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I really disliked that line. I felt like it completely missed the point. Traumas aren't interchangeable. Ward and May's experiences are so different, it seems absurd to even compare them.  Even when two experiences are equally horrible, they don't have the same effect. May's line would be like someone with ALS going up to someone with cancer and saying, ""Hey, we both have awful diseases, but mine didn't make me bald.""  And even when two people go through identical experiences, they may react differently. Most soldiers don't get PTSD, most mothers don't get post-partum depression, but the ones that do aren't worse or weaker than the ones that don't."
shield,3dtb6o,Bookbringer,6,Sun Jul 19 15:48:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah, May and Skye didn't have John Garrett manipulating them. Whereas with Ward Garrett was probably the first person to show him anything resembling kindness. You can hardly blame the guy for being loyal to him.   On a side note what with everyone calling Ward a ""traitor"" as opposed to an infiltrator? Bobbie infiltrated Hydra posing as one of them and then turned on them, but with her its viewed as ""just a mission""."
shield,3dtb6o,hamsterwaffle,6,Sun Jul 19 19:05:16 2015 UTC,"Thank you! The Traitor vs. Infiltrator distinction is one that I keep pointing out. Ward's real crime wasn't betraying the team, it was refusing to betray Garrett. Morally, that doesn't make a big difference. Being loyal to a bad person and doing bad things for him is still wrong. But it makes a big difference as far as character analysis and motivation."
shield,3dtb6o,Bookbringer,3,Sun Jul 19 20:23:38 2015 UTC,"I agree traumas are not interchangeable but with that comment I was meaning more that what happens is one thing but how a person deals with their past trauma in the present, and whether they are willing to let that define them or whether they accept responsibility in order to move beyond that. I think Ward still allows his past to define him as much as he talks about closure and moving forward with Kara.  Edit:  And I don't mean to sound flippant in saying that I know its not a matter of just waking up one day and deciding to make a fresh start but there has to be some desire to be a better person. Speaking of responsibility, i would be curious to know whether Ward had a psychiatric evaluation and therapy once he was captured and in that cell. I am guessing not as a prisoner and i do think that was irresponsible of Shield at that point to not intervene, at least by trying to rehabilitate Ward knowing well about his childhood and manipulation by Garrett but now I think it's too late."
shield,3dtb6o,Addy6,3,Sun Jul 19 21:54:14 2015 UTC,"Everything about the show seems to imply that no, Ward did not receive any psychiatric evaluation or therapy, since Coulson always said that they were planning on killing Ward once he served his purpose."
shield,3dtb6o,newX7,4,Mon Jul 20 11:15:59 2015 UTC,While you are correct I think the telling thing is ward knows exactly what he's doing. He's under no delusions and could stop any time but instead he's gone after revenge. And he's just getting worse. I know he had a tragic past but I thinks its time we just accepted hes a full villain and knows it. I mean they even revealed he killed the dog
shield,3dtb6o,Try_Another_Please,5,Sun Jul 19 18:18:44 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure I'd agree that he's under no delusions, but even assuming that's true, how does that erase the damage that's been done?  My point was that May's argument -- that Ward shouldn't have let his trauma affect him the way it has -- is unfair. I never said he wasn't a villain.  Ward is massively fucked up from his experiences, maybe irrevocably. The fact that the orginal abuse has stopped doesn't change that. An analogy: someone is run over by a truck, leaving them in incredible pain and unable to walk. This is Ward after his family's abuse. A man comes up and says he knows how to fix him -- gives him a cortisone shot and tells him to do a bunch of exercises that seem to help. Except he didn't really fix the leg, just made it temporarily functional, and every time he uses it, he exacerbates the original damage. This is Garrett and Ward's time in HYDRA. Once the cortisone shots are gone, the man is left with incredible chronic pain and a jacked up leg. Because he has no access to a doctor, he tries experimenting with painkillers that seem to help, but leave his mind cloudy, and when they wear off the pain is worse than ever, plus sometimes, even with the painkillers, he finds he can't always make his leg work the way it should. This is Ward after Garrett's death. Plus, sometimes the numbness makes him oblivious to dangers like broken glass until it's too late and now he has an infected cut to boot. This is Kara's death.  Everything that caused and exacerbated the original injury is gone, but Ward's mental health isn't going to get better just because he's escaped abuse. He can't fix his mind anymore than the guy in the story can fix his leg. He needs a professional doctor to come in with an X-ray machine, run a bunch of tests, probably break and reset the bone, maybe do surgery, maybe amputate. Even then, it may be too late. Who knows if what little good/ sane left in Ward is salvageable or enough to form a whole person. But I pity him and I wish someone would try.  I agree Ward is probably just going to keep getting worse.  From a writing/ acting perspective, Ward is one of the best tragic-past villains I've ever seen. Because his past obviously has such a powerful grip on him. His experiences aren't just bad memories that make him sad once in a while when he thinks of them. They very clearly influence who he is and what he does. So I don't agree that Ward should just get over his trauma or start coping in a healthier way -- the whole point of Ward is that he can't."
shield,3dtb6o,Bookbringer,2,Sun Jul 19 20:18:20 2015 UTC,Ward is under a lot of delusions but they are not about if he is bad or violent. He understands that he is. His whole life is trying to justify that through various personal connections. He us a tragic character certainly but I don't believe it excuses what he does or is an out for him. Someone resorting to abuse because of suffering it themselves is a known phenomenon but often such things are done in anger or in sudden bouts of emotion. Ward is very different. He is a calculated planner and he has to understand all the ibs and outs of what he is doing to accomplish that. He has reached the point if full scale manipulation and with 33 nearly turned himself into Garrett.  Yes his past is what fucked him up enough to go down this path but I believe at a certain point he embraced it fully and once he did that he lost his chance for redemption. I wouldn't want an arc on that now and I certainly don't think he deserves anything other than another bullet somewhere.   I understand that he was shaped into what he is but I have massive issues with anyone who still believes he's a hero at this point in the show. He just isn't and not even Ward is lost to the point of thinking it.  So while I agree he is an excellent tragic villain I don't agree that he's allowed to use that as an out anymore. He needs to go down or he's gonna destroy them all. At one time he may have been good but that time is permanently gone now. Everything nice he did in season 2 was an even greater manipulation
shield,3dtb6o,Try_Another_Please,4,Sun Jul 19 20:51:16 2015 UTC,"He has reached the point if full scale manipulation and with 33 nearly turned himself into Garrett.   You can't really compare. Yeah, Ward was leading Kara, but different from Garrett, Ward really did have 33's best intentions at heart. Everything Ward did in S2B was for Kara, whereas Garrett did everything he did out of self-preservation, to the point where he would have even killed Ward, his most loyal servant, if he needed to.  And honestly, if Cal can comeback from killing an entire village, Raina from genetic experiments, and the Black Widow from burning down a hospital, I'm certainly not going to draw that line with Ward. No one is ever beyond redemption."
shield,3dtb6o,newX7,5,Mon Jul 20 01:12:26 2015 UTC,"There's no point debating redemption, because everyone's opinion is based on their own moral philosophy, beliefs about human nature, etc... Ward's nice actions were tied up with evil, but they were sincere. He always has someone he does everything for. And he didn't treat Kara like Garrett treated him. At all. He was a bad influence on her, sure, because he is himself very, very damaged. But he encouraged her to reconnect with her mother -- the opposite of Garrett isolating him. He made it their mission to get her ""closure"" which Garrett certainly never got him.  And frankly, I don't see how the nano-mask scientist and Buddy are remotely alike, as one is a complete stranger who knows their secrets and one is a beloved pet and only companion of 5 years. I would count the fact that Ward is calmly targeting enemies instead of lashing out impulsively in his favor, not against. I feel like you're projecting arguments onto me that I never made. I never call him a hero. I don't think tragedy or trauma lets people off the hook for their actions (not just anymore, but ever.) I absolutely agree he has to be stopped, because he is very, very dangerous. I am simply pointing out that he has never recovered from his trauma and isn't likely to without intervention. It's unfair and unrealistic to expect him to be a well-adjusted, functioning person just because some people, who had different bad experiences turned out better."

That's pretty traumatic in a completely different way."

shield,3dtb6o,newX7,4,Tue Jul 21 03:50:24 2015 UTC,"I don't think Skye had it as bad in life as Ward did. I mean, yeah, she was shown to be moved around a lot and not have the most loving or stable families, but Ward had to literally live in a home where his own parents and older brother beat him, physically, psychologically, and emotionally abused him, and on occasion even forced him to try to murder his little brother under the threat of murdering Ward himself if he failed.  And even then, Skye fell into the Rising Tide, a hackitivst organization that tried to take down SHIELD, at the time a law-enforcement and homeland-security agency, but was able to make it out because Coulson made an attempt and reached her in time. Ward had Garrett, who pretty much real-life brainwashed the kid. Skye had it bad in life and fell into bad company, Ward had it even worse in life and fell into worse company."
shield,3dtb6o,Bookbringer,5,Mon Jul 20 00:58:17 2015 UTC,"I agree some fans overemphasize his past when bringing up redemption. There are a lot of tragic villains out there. Being a ""good"" person is not the same as having a sad explanation for why he's not.  That said, I really dislike the ""most abuse victims don't"" argument. In real life, most abuse victims don't go on the become abusers -- about a third do. This is much higher than the general population, and the vast majority of abusers were themselves abused first. Research has found several factors that increases the odds of becoming an abuser or perpetrator-- abuse that started early, abuse that was prolonged, abuse that was done by someone close to the victim, a cold or hostile family environment (research has also shown that cold, uncaring mothers do more harm than violent, but emotionally responsive ones), the child's perception of the abuse as particularly harmful, the child's sense of being unloved, the lack of outside support (other research has shown that having even one caring, involved adult -- a teacher or friend seriously bolsters a victim's resilience). Basically, there's a fuckton of things that alter how a person turns out, but no research has ever suggested that the perpetrators turn out worse because they're just inherently worse people.  Look, I agree we shouldn't pretend Ward isn't fucked up just because he has a sad explanation for why he's fucked up. But it's not like there's an abused child convention where teenagers go to a future problems fair and choose between dissociative disorders, depressive disorders, anxiety, psychopathic tendencies and being a well-adjusted, healthy person. And it isn't like Ward escaped his family, went to college, turned down therapy, etc...  This character was pulled from the frying pain to the fire to the active volcano.   Garrett didn't ""recruit"" him -- he tricked him. Legally, he kidnapped him. We saw that he told Ward he was taking him to SHIELD Academy -- a legal, government institution. We saw that for 5 years, he let Ward think he was training for SHIELD. When Ward decided to join HYDRA, he didn't even know what it was. This isn't fans extrapolating-- it's in the episode.  Also, Garrett isolated him in the woods for five years -- which real world cult specialists refer to as severe brainwashing. It's powerful stuff and gives the brainwasher a hold over their victim that doesn't go away just because they're separated or dead. It certainly doesn't magically end just because someone nice says, ""you have a choice.""  It seems really unrealistic to me to expect that Ward could've just told someone about HYDRA (they kept secret for 70 years -- they had ways). Similarly, I feel like expecting him to choose people he's known for less than a year over Garrett is kind of weird -- like, most people in his shoes would choose the person who has been the center of their life for 15 years. And afterwards, Ward didn't get like therapy or anything I would consider normal, he got locked in ISO which is pretty severe even by criminal standards, and given back to the abuser who started all this.  So I don't feel like Ward is in the same boat as most other ""I had a sad past and now I'm bad"" villains. Because he didn't really get a break, so I don't feel like he actually had a chance."
shield,3dtb6o,Vlinux,5,Sun Jul 19 15:17:04 2015 UTC,"He was hard-wired by Garrett to believe that only the strong survive. To him, it could very well been 'kill or be killed'. It's entirely possible that he kills people he becomes entagled with, but when he cares about someone (the team), he uses those skills and emotions to protect them, like with Skye, Fitz, and even Simmons when she tried to kill him."
shield,3dtb6o,newX7,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:35:28 2015 UTC,"His brother mentioned that there was a ""darkness"" in Ward (which Coulson noticed too). That time when Coulson was talking to Ward in the cell before transferring him to the government showed it particularly well. One second Ward sounds like a normal guy, then his voice, eyes and body language change and he sounds like a psychopath. It was also never entirely clear which one of them (Ward or his brother Christian) were telling the truth about what happened at The Well. It could be that Ward has been messed up inside for a long time and the time with Garrett just shoved that to the background.   I think his ""dark side"" perhaps started to come back after his encounter with the Berserker Staff. That Asguardian guy told him about the negative effects it had on people."
shield,3dtb6o,Bookbringer,4,Sun Jul 19 21:49:43 2015 UTC,"His brother also told Coulson that there wasn't a well and subtly asked Coulson if he was ""torturing"" Ward.   It could be that Ward has been messed up inside for a long time and the time with Garrett just shoved that to the background.   This could be true, but the Berserker Staff seems to imply that it's the opposite, Ward's darkness is Christian, his brother, and the trauma he underwent as a child is a result of his older brother and their parents.  Honestly, Ward, whenever he's with Christian, mostly acts normal, and Christian himself treats Ward as a rather normal guy rather than the evil, full-blown psychopath he made Ward out to be in his story to Coulson."

It's worth noting that he bought them time by refusing to shoot them down even though those were Whitehall's orders. Garrett is the closest thing we have to an expert on Ward's psyche and he seems to believe Ward cares about the team, but not enough to rival Ward's devotion to him."
shield,3dtb6o,Bookbringer,3,Sun Jul 19 14:23:35 2015 UTC,"I agree that Ward's past do not excuse his actions. The thing is, Ward does take responsibility for his actions, which he tells Christian when he takes him to the well, Ward says ""I take responsibility for my actions, Christian"" and never tried to deflect blame. Hell, even when Skye asked him if he was brainwashed, Ward says ""No, my actions were my own. I did it out of my own free will."" And in a way, Ward even shows it: As /u/Bookbringer pointed, Ward never begrudged the team for trying to hurt him personally. He fought to survive on occasion, but he never went out of his way to make anyone in the team suffer for trying to get revenge on him.  May-fractured his larynx and punched him after he was raped, Ward never brought it up.  Fitz-suffocates Ward in his cell, months later Ward is casually talking to Fitz, asking how he's been and trying to reconnect with him.  Coulson-sold Ward off to Christian and his parents, the very people who abused Ward and made his life hell, to execute him and be glorified for it while their own crimes against Ward go unpunished, Ward only makes a passing comment about it on how both sides made mistakes.  Skye-shot Ward four times in the chest, Ward still went on a mission to rescue her, never brought it up, and even showed concern for her and acted amicably with Skye.  Simmons-tried to Splinter Bomb Ward in the back when he was helping her, Ward spares her life, saying only that he's disappointed in her changing.  Ward never held it against the team when they tried to have revenge on him. He does show that he could and would kill them if he needed to, but he never held it against people for trying to do the same to him. The only people he's ever shown to actively begrudge are people who have hurt his loved ones, such as Christian, his family (the only people he actually begrudges for hurting him), and Bobbi. Hell, even when pushed by Christian about their past, Ward only brings up how Christian made him hurt Thomas rather than Christian hurting him personally. Ward bringing up his parents into shaping him to become who he is isn't deflecting blame, it's just the honest truth-nurture played a huge role in him becoming who he is, as he never once said that he didn't do something out of his own free will.  My problem with the show isn't that Ward is a villain. Hell, I could even support it. My problem is that the protagonists seem to have a double-standard against Ward which the narrative actually agrees with.  For example, with Cal-both Cal and Ward were offered the TAHITI option (this wasn't done out of an honest desire to help them, but something in exchange for their help in a time of great need), yet still Coulson shows far more sympathy for Cal, a man who literally massacred an entire village of innocent people, than he ever did for Ward, a man who killed a few more than a dozen people, most which were trained agents, with Coulson saying to Cal that he's a victim of his wife's manipulations and that he's a good man who doesn't want to hurt anybody, despite Cal being a grown man in his 20s when this started, yet with Ward, a man who literally has been 15 years through child abuse, then another 15 years of abuse with real-life methods of brainwashing, which included being left alone in a forest for 5 years with Garrett as his only human contact and the first person to show him any form of kindness (in other words, has been for 30 years, which is pretty much his entire life, abused and manipulated by almost everyone around him), and even then on occasions showed great discomfort with Garrett and killing or hurting people, Coulson tells Ward to ""take responsibility for his actions.""  And finally, the fact that despite Coulson always saying ""You can save someone if you get to them early enough/Whether it's one man or all of mankind, SHIELD believes everyone is worth saving/SHIELD never leaves a man behind"" Coulson and the team, with the exception of Fitz because that guy's such a bro (seriously, one of best characters  in the show IMO), never made any attempts to help, save, or redeem Ward, nor were they planning to, and he and Bobbi (mostly Bobbi) pretty much screwed Kara over and ruined her life.  For example, Kara is kidnapped by HYDRA, SHIELD had several occasions to save Kara, at one point even having Kara literally knocked out on the floor right in front of them, yet left her behind ""for the mission"", yet Coulson, in the midst of a ""SHIELD Civil War"", went out of his way to rescue Skye, to the point of teaming up with Grant Ward, and in the midst of a war with the Inhumans, a faction of super-powered people, still had enough time to have someone go rescue Bobbi.  And finally, the entire team has, at one point or another, tried to take revenge on Ward for hurting them, and while I don't agree with what Ward and Kara did to Bobbi (I do not believe a cycle of vengeance and hatred will improve things), Kara did the same to Morse and, IMO, is pretty justified in being pissed at Bobbi and the rest of SHIELD, especially when Bobbi had the opportunity to tell Kara the truth about her involvement in Kara's brainwashing, yet chose to hide it and only checked up on her to see how much Kara remembered about the ordeal, yet the SHIELD and the show treat her as if though she's some monster for it and as if she's pathetic and unjustified for not being completely okay with the fact that Bobbi sold her out to be tortured and brainwashed by HYDRA and that Bobbi can't be held responsible, while at the very same who is being exonerated of having to take responsibility is talking down to Ward for his own responsibility.  P.S.-Sorry for the long post."
shield,3dtb6o,Addy6,2,Mon Jul 20 00:51:46 2015 UTC,"Wow.  I have no words.  If I could give a post a standing ovation, I would. Well said!"
shield,3dtb6o,Addy6,3,Mon Jul 20 06:45:09 2015 UTC,"I feel that Ward had taken responsibility for everything that happened in season 1 when he was locked up by Coulson. Otherwise the suicide attempts would have continued when he came out of sedation.  He was trying to make amends by promising Skye nothing but the truth and by helping her find out about her past. He knew about Cal's plan and promised her he'd take her to him. He may still have had feelings for Skye, but I don't believe he held out hope that they could still be together.  In regards to hearing the Bus was shot down, it's entirely possible he was just keeping his cool while undercover with Whitehall while working for Cal. Not to mention that he wasn't exactly close with May or Tripp to begin with. He did mention that his relations with May were to keep her distracted/gain her trust."
shield,3dtb6o,Bookbringer,5,Sun Jul 19 19:32:43 2015 UTC,"I don't feel that he has taken responsibility at all. He brings up his past almost everytime his crimes are mentioned, trying to divert the conversation to himself as the victim. The reasons for his suicide attempts are not necessarily him taking responsibility. He is locked up in solitary confinement for months on end ( which I actually have an issue with, hello Geneva Convention), his father figure is dead, the woman he loves hates him, he knows the team hates him, of course he is likely to be extremely depressive, just on account of the situation he is in. Does he regret what he did or does he just regret getting caught? As far as making amends go I think he could have tried a lot harder to make amends with the whole team for that to feel genuine. Of course he is going to try and get Skye back on his side because of how he feels about her. And he may have had no reason to like May or Tripp or others in the team, but he had no good reason for wanting them dead either. He did not hesitate to shoot May/Kara in that season finale. He has no reason to have a personal vendetta against May and yet he tried to kill her"
shield,3dtb6o,DBHT14,3,Sun Jul 19 21:41:54 2015 UTC,"What I meant by taking responsibility was him cooperating and providing information, basically being a good asset. I felt this was him trying to apologize. Maybe the suicide attempts were punishment. He couldn't cope with almost killing Fitz and Simmons and maybe felt he didn't deserve to live. He realized this was the easy way out when he could still help the team.  And as far as the Bus situation, just because Ward doesn't react because there's nothing he can do about it if it were true, that doesn't necessarily mean he wants them dead.  I'm just stating my opinion, and asking if Ward is not as bad as we believe. I'm fully aware he's bad. I'm just posing the idea that maybe some of the things we perceived as bad acts were actually misunderstood."
shield,3dtb6o,Addy6,6,Sun Jul 19 22:20:22 2015 UTC,"Sure, and I agree he isn't evil, as such, mostly because I don't know that anyone is truly evil or born bad. We are all shaped by our experiences, past and present, but I do think he plays every situation for his own purposes which means sometimes he will do bad things and other times he will do good things and whoever benefits or is harmed by his actions is almost incidental, it all depends on what his objective is at that particular time and place that he is looking to serve and that is what makes him endlessly fascinating! Will be interesting to see what they will do with him in S3"
shield,3dtb6o,newX7,4,Sun Jul 19 22:57:45 2015 UTC,"I think it could be argued that everything he did, he did for Kara. Maybe he wanted to give her all these things, her face back, closure on Bobbi who had betrayed her as a SHIELD agent, so that she could move past all of that and they could be together happily?"
shield,3dtb6o,DBHT14,5,Sun Jul 19 23:01:41 2015 UTC,"Good point.  IMO, Ward's ""ends"" are always about benefitting others, not himself. First, he was devoted to saving Garrett. Then he wanted to reconnect Skye to her father (which, IMO, would be a crappy plan if he's just trying to win her, but makes a lot more sense if he genuinely believes it's ""good for her."") Then everything for Kara. I agree he must've genuinely thought ""closure"" would heal her. If he'd been thinking about his own interests, keeping Kara as a spy in SHIELD would've been much more beneficial and brainwashing Bobbi would've let him have 2 spies easily."
shield,3dtb6o,Bookbringer,7,Mon Jul 20 06:55:42 2015 UTC,"God no I hope he isn't. A redemption arc if handled poorly would just ruin his character.   He is a man with no moral center through his childhood experiences. He knows it and is ok with it, even revels in it to a degree. While knowing that his own best skill is a talent for violence but he except with Bobbi doesn't really demonstrate and sadistic or tendency for cruelty.   So he fixates on people he can work for and use his skills in return for accepting who he is. First Garrett, then Skye, then even 33, until losing all of them he sees that the only person who will ever really accept him is himself leading to wear he is at the bar gathering what appears to be similar HYDRA leftovers.   When he tries to spell everything out in the Dirty half dozen his personality and prior actions shut down any chance the team would accept him."
shield,3dtb6o,DBHT14,4,Sun Jul 19 13:04:51 2015 UTC,"That sounds chronologically wrong though. Garrett was the one who made him into what he is (with no moral center, as you put it). He forced him to learn to survive for months, and basically made him believe that he was his salvation by breaking him out of prison and giving him a chance at life.  And in the Dirty Half Dozen, the team shut him down trying to open up, not his personality. Listen to their conversation and you'll see they just refuse to hear what he has to say."
shield,3dtb6o,Bookbringer,4,Sun Jul 19 19:27:41 2015 UTC,Yes but at the same time he gave his 'heartfelt' speech in Dirty half dozen he was plotting and setting up for what would happen in the finale. Makes it impossible to take anything he says at face value.
shield,3dtb6o,DBHT14,3,Sun Jul 19 22:21:07 2015 UTC,"It's possible that because he was faced by his original team, it was his chance to finally be open to them and apologize. The plotting was for Kara to capture Bobbi. Completely separate situations. But that's how I interpreted it."
shield,3dtb6o,Addy6,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:23:16 2015 UTC,"To be fair to Ward, I always interpreted that seen as being to Team Coulson; the new recruits, Bobbi included, don't mean anything to Ward. Ward's regrets betraying the team and that they can't be together again, but he knowing that nothing he does will ever fix that, but he probably didn't think Bobbi had anything to do with what he had to say to Team Coulson."
shield,3dtb6o,Bookbringer,3,Tue Jul 21 16:29:52 2015 UTC,"Garrett found him in the detention center remember. He was never in a good place, we might not have straight answers for his childhood, but if we take some of his and Christian's statements we can surmise it was not positive and he never developed a moral code."
shield,3dtb6o,Bookbringer,5,Sun Jul 19 19:29:30 2015 UTC,"Ward has on numerous occasions expressed a sense of gratitude/obligation, loyalty, and concern for those he identifies with. So I would argue that Ward's morals are limited to interpersonal relations, rather than non-existant. From a psycho-social perspective, he's morally immature/ stunted, rather than completely devoid of morals."
shield,3dtb6o,Bookbringer,4,Sun Jul 19 20:31:25 2015 UTC,He lowered the rope to help his brother in the well. Even after Christian told him he'd throw him in too if he helped him. I'm pretty sure he had morals and was just broken along the way.
shield,3dtb6o,Bookbringer,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:46:43 2015 UTC,And look where it landed him! He has on plenty of occasions acted to aid others but it is usually in the form of nurturing an alliance or for his own gain.  It is entirely possible Grant wanted his 3rd brothers help to stop Christian's antics and when that didnt happen is when the fire that landed him in lockup happened.
shield,3dtb6o,SkyscreamMxO,4,Sun Jul 19 20:02:09 2015 UTC,"When has Ward done anything for his own gain? He did everything for Garrett without asking anything in return, and we saw echoes of that with Kara. He didn't help them to get them to do what he wanted -- helping them was all he wanted."
shield,3dtb6o,TheLudwigen,3,Mon Jul 20 06:39:20 2015 UTC,"I should be watching the episode soon where Christian and Grant are dealing with the past so I'll see what I take from it, but Garrett took advantage of a weak Grant who was always bullied, and pushed him and pushed him until it was drilled into his mind that the only way to be in control is by being strong and making those kinds of decisions, albeit drastic and morally wrong."
shield,3dtb6o,emma_pops,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:07:25 2015 UTC,"I dont think you can really say Garrett did much actual pushing. All he did was remove Grant from any sort of environment with external morals and social pressures. By taking and leaving him out to the wilderness he essentially took him back to the ""state of nature"" as it were.  Surviving on his own was enough then to strip all concerns save self preservation from Ward, with Garrett simply positioning himself as the lifeline to the rest of the world and all it held."
shield,3dtb6o,Bookbringer,3,Sun Jul 19 20:11:56 2015 UTC,"I would encourage you to rewatch some of those episodes in Season 1. If leaving him in the woods for ""a month"" only to come back several months later isn't ""much pushing"", the emotional insults were.   On numerous occasions Garret was in Ward's face telling him that he needed to do this or that if he didn't want to be weak."
shield,3dtb6o,emma_pops,6,Sun Jul 19 20:19:48 2015 UTC,"Agent 33 tells Bobbi when she is captured in the finale that Garrett made Ward kill his dog, so it suggests Ward did in fact make the kill"
shield,3dtb6o,Bookbringer,1 point,Sun Jul 19 07:28:01 2015 UTC,"But the thing is we never saw Ward pull the trigger. It's entirely possible Garrett tracked the dog down as we saw with the rifle scope. Ward only had a pistol and a shotgun, neither of which have that kind of scope.  He could have told Kara that Garrett told him to kill his dog, but maybe he just didn't elaborate on the details because the dog ended up dead anyway. This show has always been good on fake-outs. May, Victoria Hand, Bobbi, Mack, Gonzales' SHIELD, they were all painted as shady, and turned out to be good in the end. Even Simmons looked to have turned to Hydra before we find out she was undercover."
shield,3dtb6o,newX7,4,Sun Jul 19 19:45:19 2015 UTC,"I doubt the writers would waste time bringing up the dog only to mislead us again. There's just no point..just like there's no reason for Ward to bring up the dog and lie to Kara. Besides, honestly, I don't get how killing the dog makes Ward more evil. We saw how much he cared about that dog, so obviously, if he obeyed, Garrett's power over him was seriously strong. If he hadn't killed the dog, I'd wonder why he couldn't resist Garrett's orders to spare/ save people."
shield,3dtb6o,Bookbringer,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:37:28 2015 UTC,"The significance of that scene was that killing someone he cared about on orders from Garrett was the line he couldn't bring himself to cross. And if Garrett did indeed kill the dog after he saw Ward let it go, it speaks volumes about how he treats those he cares about.  As I said earlier, if Ward knew Garrett would step in and take care of Fitz and Simmons if he couldn't kill them, jettisoning the pod with them in it was to fool Garret and keep them safe from him. He's a specialist. I'm sure he knew everything about the Bus's workings and that the pod should have floated. It just seemed like an accident made Ward's actions misunderstood. Especially when he tells Fitz that was his intention. It wouldn't make sense for him to lie to Fitz, especially while he was locked up with nowhere to go."
shield,3dtb6o,newX7,3,Sun Jul 19 20:46:29 2015 UTC,"You could get basically the same emotional scenario if Garrett, for example, shot the dog non-fatally, putting Ward in the position of putting Buddy out of his misery. You could also say that that Ward had changed in the 10 years between Buddy and Fitzsimmons. You could say anything, but I think hoping Ward didn't really kill the dog is a tremendous waste of time.  The writers put that scene in there to resolve the debate. There is no other reason to bring up such a minor issue, and there is no reason to outright lie.  Regardless of the emotional meaning, Ward killed his dog."
shield,3dtb6o,Bookbringer,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:22:36 2015 UTC,"Sorry if it's been confirmed in the show already, I just couldn't remember if it had been. But I was just wondering if it was worded so it would be left open to interpretation. I can't remember the exact line."

shield,3dtb6o,Bookbringer,9,Sun Jul 19 06:48:03 2015 UTC,"His one flaw was attachments and he was trying to keep everyone safe the entire time. Yes he was a sleeper agent, but it looks like he truly did still care about his team.   Also in regards to Skye, a small detail I noticed was him telling her ""Maybe I just take you, and wake something up inside of you"". Didn't realize it then, but now it's a clear nod to Inhumans."
shield,3dtb6o,Abino_Bama,6,Sun Jul 19 06:56:44 2015 UTC,"The quote is ""maybe I'll just take what I want, wake up something inside of you"". It's a thinly veiled rape threat. Ward did shoot the dog, but was too ""weak""  to do it too it's face. Same with Fitzsimmons. He couldn't look them in the face so he turned his back as he couldn't face his ""weakness"". Whatever his past Ward is completely unable to accept responsibility for his actions, instead blaming them on anything and anyone else he can. It's what makes him interesting."
shield,3dtb6o,Abino_Bama,5,Sun Jul 19 09:58:15 2015 UTC,"I never understood that rape interpretation of the line.  It could have been a rape-y line if there were any indication that sex was what he wanted from her and what he was talking about then. But Ward has never been a sex-driven character. All his actions before and after have made it clear that what he wants from her is ""understanding"" not sex. That's why when he kidnaps her in 2.10, he takes her to her father instead of running off to a safehouse and waiting for Stockholm syndrome to kick in.  What he wants is for to understand him for who (he thinks) he is.  What he'll  wake up in her is her feelings for him, once she sees him for who he really is (according to him)."
shield,3dtb6o,Conspicor,2,Sun Jul 19 17:38:45 2015 UTC,"Give any man a line that says ""I'll take what I want"" and there's always going to be a rape connotation. Fitz could say it and it would sound like a rape threat. He's implying by taking what he wants now, she may agree later. At the very least it implies her consent isn't in his mind. Even if it isn't sexual it still means she will have no consent in the matter, asserting his masculine dominance and making her submissive to his actions. Even if you argue it isn't sexual, it's still deeply disturbing that he doesn't see her consent in actions to be important as long as the outcome is in her favour. He's messed up!"
shield,3dtb6o,newX7,4,Sun Jul 19 22:18:16 2015 UTC,"Pshaw. Fitz couldn't even make, ""I'm going to rape you,"" sound like a rape threat. It would sound like a charming metaphor and then I'd ruffle his hair.  And I don't agree about most men. If I hear a guy talk about taking what he wants, my reflex is, ""Bitch better not touch my fries.""  With Ward, I honestly assumed he was talking more in the ""seize the day"" sense of taking -- time or opportunity or what have you, forcing her per se. That he meant he'd stop being all work and orders and mission guy all the time."

shield,3dtb6o,Bookbringer,3,Mon Jul 20 13:51:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah, this show struggles with unfortunate implications. And frankly all sci-fi/ fantasy shows are crap about sexist double standards when it comes to mind control rape.  And Schroedinger's cat is basically a paradox regarding the unknown status of a hypothetical cat. It's alive when it goes it, but dead eventually, so while it's in the box, you can think of it as both dead and alive until you know which it is for sure.  So, this writer was saying,  you could think of Ward's remarks as both a rape threat and not a rape threat until you know for sure."

shield,3dtb6o,newX7,4,Mon Jul 20 07:02:46 2015 UTC,"There are plenty of discussions about Ward being sympathetic on tumblr, twitter and most fanfic sites. They just tend not to make their way to Reddit.  At this point, redemption is entirely an issue of personal philosophy. If you believe he can be redeemed, you probably believe anyone can be redeemed no matter what they've done because of your belief in the goodness of human nature of something. Hardly anyone claims he's a pretty OK guy who's just misunderstood. He's tragic, but disturbed as fuck. Although character interpretation is still fun.   Regarding the dog -- Kara said he shot it, and he had no reason to lie to her. Personally, I think this just reinforces what power Garrett had over Ward. We saw that he cared about the dog. I know some people think shooting the dog makes him more evil, but if he had spared it, it would have been like, ""Wow. So you can defy orders to spare your dog, but not innocent humans? Come on.""  Arguments about the medpod always end in a standstill. Basically, some people think Ward is so good, he would've found a way to kill them if he'd really wanted to. Others think, Ward is so good, he could've found a way to save them if he'd really wanted to. We don't know enough about the build of the bus/ medpod or the number if HYDRA agents  on board to know what Ward could've done differently. Personally, I think he was genuinely unwilling to kill Fitzsimmons and genuinely unwilling to disobey Garrett so he took a middle ground and left it in the air like a coin toss. He didn't do his absolute best to save them, and he didn't do his absolute best to kill them. He just sort of worked his way out of it and hoped."
shield,3dtb6o,newX7,3,Sun Jul 19 16:12:00 2015 UTC,"Ward used the pistol to make the dog go running off, so that he could use the rifle. It wasn't Garret who used the rifle, remember Ward said something along the lines of  ""This dog runs off into the field anytime I fire the gun"""

With FS, he could shoot them either, but just pushing a couple of buttons he doesn't kill them directly, but indirectly. It's his actions that caused their death (as far as he knows)."

He thinks highly of Natasha now which means he believes people who've done horrible things can change for the better.  And he baldly stated that Cal was a good person (deep down) and not responsible for his nightmarish acts of violence because his wife made them do it. This is pretty odd considering Ward was a lot more vulnerable to Garrett than Cal was Jiaying. My guess is that Coulson is too close to it with Ward. He knew many of Ward's victims personally and counted them as friends. He can't be objective, but that doesn't mean that Ward should be held to a completely different standard than most other characters just because ""it's personal."" Coulson should outsource handling Ward to someone he trusts who doesn't have a personal involvement with him."

I might have been able to forgive him since he had a troubled childhood and all, but his current actions cannot be excused.  Ward is a villain.  As for Cal, much like Ward, all he did was for his family. And ultimately, just like Natasha, and unlike Ward, he actually expressed remorse.  Grant Ward knows no remorse.

This is one of the reasons why I have trouble  calling his arc a redemption -- because he didn't really change. He did everything for his wife and daughter, and when push came to shove, he picked his daughter over his wife. If he had stood up to Jiaying on behalf of innocent people, that would be different.

And even AFTER Black Widow joined SHIELD, it's pretty much implied that she continued doing the same kind of stuff she did before, only that now for SHIELD, as hinted at the end of Winter Soldier.  And yes, Cal did everything that he did for his family, but he still did much worse than Ward ever actually did.  His current be actions can't be excused, and he needs to be stopped, but the thing is that even before Cal showed remorse, Coulson and team pretty much showed far more sympathy for him than they ever did for Ward and dismissed what he did as ""his wife manipulating him"" while Ward was ""take responsibility for his actions.""  Ward didn't have a troubled childhood, he had a troubled life, 15 years of abuse with his family, plus another 15 years of abuse and brainwashing with Garrett, five of which were being isolated from humanity with Garrett has his only human link.  I'm not trying to bring Black Widow or Cal down, I admit they regretted their actions and are fully redeemed in my eyes, which is something I think Ward still needs to go through. I'm saying that they have done worse than Ward, yet Ward is kinda being held to a double-standard by Team Coulson and the narrative even prior to one of them showing regret, despite having done less than both of those characters and arguably having had it worse in life than one of those characters (Cal)."

shield,3dsl5c,kickpuncher1,5,Sun Jul 19 02:04:37 2015 UTC,"I know a little about the industry so I may be able to offer a little insight. The reality is you most likely wouldn't be able to get an agent that has those connections right away. Even if you did they most likely wouldn't be able to get it for you seeing as it seems you don't see to have a lot of previous work. Jumping to a show as big as AoS right away is something that most likely wont happen. You need to start small. Acting is a very tough demanding career path that requires many years of dedication. My advice is that if you only want to act to be in AoS then acting may not be something for you. You should do it because you love to act. If you do in fact wish to act then I suggest auditioning for local plays around where you live. The sad reality though is that unless your a big name actor, you don't really get to choose what you work on. An agent would give you auditions and you take whatever you get. Mostly beginning actors can only land small things like commercials and small student or independent films. The actors on AoS were acting for a long time before they got to AoS."

And in order to get into a show like AOS (or really any show), you’re going to need to get an agent - preferably one in LA. You’re also going to need to get a pretty large portfolio, so literally work in as much as you can (as long as it’s appropriate for your ‘brand’ - because as soon as you start acting, your name and your face is now a brand.) If you don’t have one yet, start an IMDB page when you’ve got some work up your sleeve - attact photos and if you have one an acting reel. Literally get your face out there. But the biggest thing is probably to get yourself an agent, because that’s how you get a job (It’s expensive I know, but if you’re really insistant on acting as a careerit’s necessacary)"
shield,3dsl5c,Samablam,3,Sun Jul 19 08:34:32 2015 UTC,"I have two high school friends (well, one friend and one ex) who are now fairly successful TV stars.

Yes, both of these people went to the same high school, yes they both acted together, yes I acted with both of them in school theatre stuff. I still hang out with the latter (my friend) when he's in town.   Put simply: Get a good agent.   Explaining these things and getting you on casting lists is their job. Many times, you start with a smaller agent and work your way up as larger and more connected agents see your work, and/or you see if they're taking new clients once you've grown your reel. It's extremely rare that your starting agent takes you to Hollywood.   If you don't have an agent, you're basically not going anywhere but local theatre."

Jarvis and Peggy were very entertaining and it was a lot of fun watching it. I typically don't watch things all the way through every episode/season though...but that's just me.   I would just select random episodes or read a synopsis and if it interests you I would just watch that episode and if your into it watch the next one. That's how I typically get into a series."

I've loved it from the start, but yes after CA2 they take the training wheels off. The kids on the show grow up fast, and its been a great ride ever since."
shield,3dm38g,Xetren,4,Fri Jul 17 12:54:08 2015 UTC,"You gave up two episodes early.  Starting in episode 10, the freak of the week thing becomes very rare.  And it starts to get really really good.  Edit: 12 and 15 kinda do one offs, but also get referenced in season 2."

shield,3dm38g,idkmybffljill,3,Fri Jul 17 15:25:28 2015 UTC,"If you've seen the first eight, then you're really close to where it gets good. 10 and 11 is a major two parter, so is 13 and 14. Then you can pick up with 16, which happens in parallel to The Winter Soldier, and it's all good after there. (12 isn't very important, and 15 is just bad.)  Trust me, if you didn't like the one episode stories, then the rest of the show is golden for you. After 16, it's pretty much one serial story."
shield,3dm38g,Regularjoe42,3,Fri Jul 17 16:54:38 2015 UTC,"12 isn't very important, and 15 is just bad.   I have to disagree with you on that, 12 is a VERY important episode for Skye. Although i agree with you that 15 is pretty bad."

shield,3dkg32,Jackal_6,7,Fri Jul 17 00:08:10 2015 UTC,Why do people find it so hard to believe Ward is just Ward? It made sense for Skye to be Daisy because even in the beginning we knew Skye was a mystery from episode 1. With Ward it was nothing like that they told us a majority of his history from the beginning.He was always going to be Ward.
shield,3dkg32,SwagBelow,2,Fri Jul 17 03:03:10 2015 UTC,"It would be interesting if that's our Ward, but since he doesn't look like the AoS Grant Ward at all, I personally am assuming it's a same-name coincidence until he shows up again and does something Ward-like."
shield,3dkg32,Bookbringer,3,Fri Jul 17 02:52:37 2015 UTC,"That's not our Ward, if anything that's an ALTERNATE UNIVERSE Ward who serves Hydra with faith. That book is a Secret Wars tie-in one, all of those showcases remnants of alternate universes that have been patched up by Dr. Doom into a big Battleword ""planet"" following the destruction of the Multiverse. There are MANY versions of the same character throughout Battleworld as a result, and characterizations vary wildly with them. Case in point: 616 Reed Richards is the hero Mister Fantastic, but while the 1610 one started like that as well he ended up evolving into a villain, The Maker."
shield,3dkg32,Demileto,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:37:05 2015 UTC,"To be fair, the agents in the official SHIELD comic rarely look like the show actors either!"
shield,3dkg32,kickshaw,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:36:06 2015 UTC,Working for Hydra is Ward like. Why do people find it so hard to believe that is Ward he is not a big character in the MCU so it makes sense to give him a small role in the comics.
shield,3dkg32,SwagBelow,3,Fri Jul 17 02:58:04 2015 UTC,"I don't find it hard to believe Ward's role will be as small as the rest of the teams' roles. I do find it a little hard to believe that he would be introduced in a different series from all the cast with no real introduction. But mostly I find it hard to believe that that guy is really supposed to be Grant Ward from AoS because, as I stated, he doesn't look like Brett at all. Everyone else is drawn to look like their TV counterparts.  So until we get confirmation that it's supposed to be him, I'm assuming it's just someone with the same name. These things happen in the MCU.  Also, serving HYDRA is really a thin connection. This dude appears to be an enthusiastic hail-HYDRA underling. Ward is a ""use HYDRA to achieve goals then leave it"" guy."
shield,3dkg32,Bookbringer,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:26:50 2015 UTC,"I don't know how much we can say about his personality considering he's only in two panels, but the guy was ""born & raised"" in a universe where Hydra founded NYC. I don't think there are too many non-fervent Hydra agents in that reality."

shield,3djmn1,French__Canadian,10,Thu Jul 16 22:48:49 2015 UTC,I agree. Just a whole  season of them going on adorable cute dates and adopting dogs and monkeys. And we get comedy gold when the monkey keeps fiddling with Fitz's designs. Kind of like Marcel in friends. Lol
shield,3djmn1,emma_pops,2,Thu Jul 16 23:36:09 2015 UTC,and the monkey has to almost die at the end of the season
shield,3djmn1,poppymelt,9,Sat Jul 18 03:38:32 2015 UTC,I think there's enough with Secret Warriors and the coming influx of powered people due to the OmegaKree fish oils to fill the entire season. I'd like to see a couple stand alone episodes though. They usually provide a bit more character growth and comedic relief.
shield,3djmn1,antonious13,3,Thu Jul 16 21:13:30 2015 UTC,"I can see them working out Secret Warriors in the first half of the season, and then using them for a Civil War-themed second half.  I think they could really go the route of first half of Season 1. The beginning can have character development. There can be many parallels such as   Coulson's team = Skye's Secret Warriors Case of the week = Recruiting new Inhumans Those neat little gadgets = Inhumans' powers   They could have the overarching enemy Possibly Lash since he was announced like Centipede was for the first season. Have the Secret Warriors go on missions to deal with Inhumans.  And of course the signs are all pointing to Civil War (Real SHIELD, Superhumans/Inhumans appearing), with possibly Skye's Secret Warriors at the center of a very public incident for the mid-season finale."
shield,3djmn1,Hawkguy67,2,Fri Jul 17 06:52:12 2015 UTC,"Well obviously I'd like Fitzsimmons to get together start working in the lab again - I kinda miss seeing them saving the day with science. Obviously not every episode but in some of them at least.   I'd also like to see some origin stories laid for later seasons as other than graviton, most of the origin stories have been resolved.  And maybe like a creepy bottle episode set just in the playground with some sort of invisible force stalking them. Kind of like repairs in S1 but better.  And I'd like it to get a bit more political, with shield having to deal with issues of missions happening in unfriendly nations and building up their worldwide legitimacy again.   And then some super powered people too. Pretty damn big wishlist I know."
shield,3djmn1,emma_pops,2,Thu Jul 16 23:41:33 2015 UTC,"I don't agree that the second half was an entirely new plot. It was a continuation of the plot from the first half imo.   But yes, I would like season three to continue with the same dynamic of building up to the mid season break with a finale style episode to top it off."
shield,3djmn1,SkyscreamMxO,3,Fri Jul 17 03:19:02 2015 UTC,"What I meant was - the majority of plotlines established in the beginning of season two - such as Whitehall and the alien writing mystery were resolved by the midseason finale and the second half of the season went on to introduce new plotlines (Inhumans, Skye's mother, Real SHIELD, etc)."

shield,3djmn1,OhEightFour,2,Fri Jul 17 03:43:06 2015 UTC,"Jed had mentioned in an interview that subsequent seasons would mirror season 2 - season 1 took a bit of idling to find it's stride because they had to wait for The Winter Soldier. Season two very much consists of two concise arcs that just so happened to line up with their winter break and Agent Carter's premiere nicely.  I think he described it as ""two seasons in one"" and mentioned that the format worked a lot better in keeping audience interest over a shorter arc."
shield,3djmn1,TLH3,2,Fri Jul 17 14:14:00 2015 UTC,"Ward needs to be the big bad guy.  Movies have these ""lone good guy vs an organization of badguys"" tropes.  Ward can be that one competent bad guy messing with Shield, commando style.  (Though he does miss having a team...)"

This was run by someone in SHIELD (Fury?) They attacked and did damage to Latveria.. and a Female leader (I don't know where VonDoom was) ordered a counterattack that Led to something before Civil War started.   It's a magical place

shield,3df983,rpmaluki,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:32:01 2015 UTC,"The artist is Roland Boschi.  Here's the preview from CBR.  Aside from the three panels I posted Ward only featured as a silhouette in another just above those in the Zola interogation scene.  He's been sent to hunt down the lone hero so presumably we'll see more of him in later issues.  The comic itself is about a part of Battleworld which Hydra is the government (1984 style).  Main character is Cap's son, Ian Rogers as Nomad.  He asks a local when Hydra conquered New York and gets the reply ""Hydra founded NY""...  Rick Remender is doing the writing."

shield,3df983,RRodd,2,Thu Jul 16 03:16:39 2015 UTC,"It's Battleworld - there's multiple copies of all the heroes spread around all the zones.  That'd include ordinary people (and Ward) too.  There might be other versions of him and the rest of the AOS cast in other zones.  A Ward in Greenland (Hulk-out central) might be fun...  Every thing's slipping away from Doom now, probably because of the arrival of the two inter-dimensional life rafts from the 616/1610 incursion event before.  All the characters are all having dreams and flashes of what things used to be like before God Doom created this mishmash world."

It's a bit hard to explain if you don't know anything about what's going on in Battleworld, every alternate universe and even the main universe was destroyed, and Doom re-created everything from what he remembers, with that making different domains and into each domain there are different versions of the same characters in each region as snarkamedes already said. Just to clarify, [almost] nobody is who they used to be, they are kinda brainwashed and is some cases with added super powers. Hope once this event finishes we can have great adaptations of the AoS characters Spoiler alert: Coulson will appear in the All-New All-Different Karnak comics"

They could fudge his origin story, so that he's a kind of real life diviner/Inhuman killer, and they unleash him when they get Simmons back maybe?   This thought has literally just occurred to me.

shield,3dfzpq,emma_pops,5,Thu Jul 16 01:06:44 2015 UTC,Its movements don't seem random. The other times it goes sloshy is just before Gordon teleports into a room. And the sheer fact it doesn't go for Fitz suggests Simmons was chosen for a reason. Can't believe there are still 11weeks to go :(
shield,3dfzpq,emma_pops,5,Wed Jul 15 23:58:45 2015 UTC,I'm glad I'm not crazy in thinking this lol. But I guess the leap here was the significance of the Chitauri blood in her.  I'm rewatching both seasons right now. It's so much more fun binging. Should hold me over til Season 3.

shield,3dgthv,DaBest13,6,Thu Jul 16 03:58:17 2015 UTC,AoS can finally stand on it's own. It does not really need to connect to the movies in any way. Civil War has already been confirmed to be an Avengers event and not effecting all the MCU. AoS has finally found its niche which is Inhumans and does not need the movies to impact it.
shield,3dgthv,SwagBelow,4,Thu Jul 16 04:19:53 2015 UTC,"Yes but given the sheer scale of Civil War, it's impossible that AoS will not address it at all. There's no way you could live in the MCU and not even talk/hear about Iron Man battling Captain America."
shield,3dgthv,ezrs158,2,Thu Jul 16 06:54:13 2015 UTC,It makes sense for the Civil War to be heard about. But this person is making to sound like Civil War should affect the show in a big way. It should not because that is a Avengers event and not affecting the MCU in a big way..

shield,3dfftc,Demileto,7,Thu Jul 16 00:29:58 2015 UTC,"I really liked T.R.A.C.K.S. on season 1. Multiple POV's leading the same climax was a nice touch, it would be nice to have it again.  Oh, and mind swap. Fits dealing with Daisy's powers it's pure gold."
shield,3dfftc,lhcardoso,6,Thu Jul 16 03:22:07 2015 UTC,"An alternate reality for Ward might be interesting. Except, I honestly think he'd screw it up himself before the end.  And in any case, I'm not sure things would actually be better. Garrett would recruit someone else and who knows what they'd be like? Better or worse?  The episode I want to see... A bottle episode. Everyone trapped in a cave in and pinned by rocks so they can't fight. And they have to talk about their feelings."
shield,3dfftc,Bookbringer,2,Thu Jul 16 03:07:18 2015 UTC,"Those are some good points I actually thought about that. It would be interesting. Especially if some higher being character showed up to basically shadow him throughout the whole experience.   Like he found out Simmons and Fitz were dead and asked why only to get this answer ""Because you weren't there to save Simmons when she went out the plane, you weren't there to do a lot of things. Like instead of outright killing Fitz you sent him down into the ocean where he was eventually rescued by Furry. However that didn't happen in this reality, here the guy Garrett sent outright killed him by putting a bullet in his head."" It would be interesting if Ward did something good and decided to change reality back especially if he ended up going against Garrett.  Not going to lie I do want to see a bottle episode to an idea I have is him and Skye being stranded on top of a snowy mountain and being forced to work together. That or him and Fitz being stuck in a cargo container that is sinking to the bottom of the ocean and Ward has to keep Fitz calm."
shield,3dfftc,Bookbringer,3,Thu Jul 16 03:51:45 2015 UTC,"Honestly, the idea with Ward having to endure some variant of the medpod incident, especially with one or both of Fitzsimmons could make for some awesome drama."
shield,3dfftc,sgeswein,1 point,Thu Jul 16 05:35:44 2015 UTC,"I want an episode where Simmons starts the season seemingly intact, except for a half-hour gap in her memory.  Which no one notices until Fitz shows up with a list of restaurants for a date Simmons doesn't remember she has.  And then we all have to figure out what really happened in Simmons' head, what happened in Fitz's head, and what really happened."
shield,3dfftc,newX7,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:57:34 2015 UTC,"An episode where Coulson's SHIELD and Ward's HYDRA have to work together against a greater force than any of them can handle alone, such as a faction of the US government working for/being manipulated by a still alive Christian, Papa, and Mama Ward.  Or an episode where the rest of the team have to talk to Ward but they can't fight him and vice-versa, so they just stand around there and talk. Or an episode in which we finally see and have the team learn of the true extent of Ward's abuse.  Or an episode where someone actually calls out SHIELD on mistakes they've made and SHIELD actually has to deal with the consequences of their actions."
shield,3dfftc,Bookbringer,3,Fri Jul 17 17:32:05 2015 UTC,"I would love SHIELD to get a ""What the hell, heroes"" speech from someone. However, since most of their mistakes seem to be more writing oversights than intentional character flaws, I'm not confident.  Personally, I actually hope Ward's trauma stays a little mysterious. I want him to get some validation that it happened and was bad (and not his fault), but taking the mystery completely out of these things usually is a bad call."
shield,3dfftc,newX7,3,Sun Jul 19 16:57:39 2015 UTC,"The thing is, writing oversights with demonizing certain characters like Ward and Cal and his team of super villains, and Jaiying just makes SHIELD come off as more hypocritical than anything and really makes me not want to root for them. And that's why fans exist, not only to adore the show, but to criticize and point out the flaws in it. And honestly, SHIELD has, with all due respect, cocked up enough times now that anyone could easily give them a ""What the Hell, Heroes"" speech.  I just want to find out what happened to Ward. I'm okay not getting all the details, as long as we are shown the most traumatic event and the rest of the abuse is clear enough for us to imagine what was going on behind the scenes."
shield,3dfftc,Bookbringer,2,Sun Jul 19 18:13:14 2015 UTC,"From Ward's perspective, The Well was his most traumatic event -- he describes as his worst memory. But I wouldn't mind getting some psych insight into the family dynamic for sure. Mom obviously has black or white thinking, so maybe Narcissism or BPD?  As for villains -- I agree with you. I'm just not optimistic. Gonzalez and real SHIELD were the writers' opportunity to call out Coulson and our SHIELD for their flaws. Instead of an epic armor-piercing smackdown we got a few trumped up, easily dismissed criticisms of Coulson, while most of his real mistakes were ignored."
shield,3dfftc,newX7,2,Sun Jul 19 19:34:50 2015 UTC,Okay don't freak out but I love you right now I actually have a theory that Dotty from AC could be Ward's mother.

shield,3d1qnn,SQUID_FUCKER,2,Mon Jul 13 05:33:54 2015 UTC,"Yeah.

shield,3d1qnn,Khaim,2,Mon Jul 13 20:51:42 2015 UTC,Joss said there's no plan for a director's cut. He said the Avengers 2 that came out is the one he wanted to release.
shield,3d1qnn,Febrifuge,7,Mon Jul 13 06:42:34 2015 UTC,"Then they need an Executive Producer's cut or whatever. There's probably almost 2 hours worth of material that ended up on the cutting room floor, and the movie ""he wanted to release"" quite obviously had gaping holes where good chucks of that need to be put back in. It was clearly a movie he had to release due to running time constraints, whether he wanted to or not."
shield,3d1qnn,rpmaluki,3,Mon Jul 13 11:40:17 2015 UTC,"Depending on how far along in the process it was cut, most of that stuff probably wasn't finished in terms of CGI and stuff so I wouldn't bet on seeing a special edition with those scenes. Maybe we'll see some of the stuff as deleted scenes on the bluray version."
shield,3d1qnn,cardassian_tailor,3,Mon Jul 13 15:20:11 2015 UTC,"Joss did say there would be deleted scenes on the DVD.  In other interviews he said his first cut was about 3 hours 15 minutes.  So, I know there is a lot he initially wanted in that didn't make it.  Basically, he said that narratively, the movie is pretty close to what he wanted, just some of the transitions aren't as smooth as he would have liked.  He said not wanting to do a director's cut was partly about laziness (though it was said pretty tongue in cheek) and mostly about how he had always promised himself he wouldn't do director's cuts, because he wants to put out the thing that he is proud of.  He doesn't want to keep going back and tweaking it once it is in the can.  I think there is something to be said for that.  When I told my husband (who was wanting a director's cut) that he said that, his response was, ""Good for him, maybe George Lucas can take notes from him""  When the bluray comes out, I am sure an intrepid fan will cut in some of the deleted scenes into the film to make a sort of director's cut."
shield,3d1qnn,Febrifuge,2,Mon Jul 13 18:18:02 2015 UTC,"If nothing else, there's definitely 2-3 scenes worth of plot missing from Thor's storyline."

She must have just landed on it badly, maybe her whole weight landed on her elbow?  She was lucky she didn't need a cast as that would have been tricky for her other scenes (would they hide it or include it?). Luckily broken elbows don't hurt that much and you just wear a sling for a few weeks then back to normal (at least in my experience)."
shield,3cx2so,Arion_Miles,3,Sat Jul 11 17:14:12 2015 UTC,"I feel that a show involving spies infiltrating enemy hideouts and carrying covert operations requires more hand-to-hand combat than gun totting. This show needs more action scenes like this and it'll be more enjoyable. Yeah sure, she shot like five to six agents as well, but if she made use of complete ninja skills, it'd have been better. Not that I'm complaining."
shield,3cx2so,I_SHIT_ON_CATS,9,Sat Jul 11 17:54:12 2015 UTC,"I would say a big chunk of the fight scenes avoid gun use - mostly because I think it's generally more exciting from a production standpoint to fight rough and use the environment around you (smashing chairs over heads and the likes), instead of just killing agents point blank left and right. Bobbi makes heavy use of her batons in most of her fight scenes. Skye has a good deal of martial arts in her choreography, as she is trained by May and it should reflect that. One of my favorite fight scenes (other than the one shot) is actually the one where Yam beats the crap out of her - they're actually fighting OVER a gun for a decent amount of it."
shield,3cx2so,Xetren,2,Sat Jul 11 18:34:32 2015 UTC,"I actually like the point-blank gunfighting that's coming up in recent media, like John Wick, Kingsmen, and now this.

Do you not have a decent delicatessen where you live? Shame. It's quite delicious. Both pesto and aioli are olive oil based sauces, they meld wonderfully together as a single sauce. It helps cream up the basil very well."
shield,3cumtg,goodbrock,-1,Sat Jul 11 14:37:09 2015 UTC,"ok, ok, I get it, you can add pesto and aioli and get pesto aioli. In the same vein, you can also add garlic to mayo and you get garlic mayo. Which is the same as aioli. (Look it up, the only difference between aioli and plain mayo is the addition of garlic.)"
shield,3cumtg,skalpelis,3,Sat Jul 11 18:13:50 2015 UTC,"Aioli is made with olive oil, whereas mayo is made with canola oil.  Also, the process of making them is a bit different.  There's a pretty significant distinction there, and you are putting your fingers in your ears and saying ""lalala I can't hear you!"" Whenever people try to point that out.  Yes, both foods have similar uses, and similar flavor profiles without the garlic, but there is still a distinction, and you can't just throw some garlic into mayo and call it aioli.  It's basically like saying that grits is just breakfast polenta, and totally ignoring the fact that polenta and grits are made from different grains."
shield,3cumtg,Neuro_nerdo,2,Sat Jul 11 19:22:05 2015 UTC,"Wrong again. Apart from the primary difference in ingredient usage mentioned by the other user (see garlic and olive oil vs. canola oil), there's yet another crucial distinction between the two. Mayonnaise's emulsion is both flavored and stabilized with an acid (often acetic or citric). This also contributes to the difference in consistency between the two. Not to mention aïoli and mayonnaise are utilized in very different types of dishes. They're about as different as meringue is to scrambled eggs. ""Both are whipped but one has yolk and the other doesn't,"" /s  Now that we're clear on that, the only reason why I bothered to begin this argument was due to your hypocrisy. You made a distinction between two very different sauces (pesto and aïoli) yet failed to recognize the difference between aïoli and mayonnaise. Also for your ignorance in understanding the simple concept of compound sauces like pesto aïoli. Which, I may remind you, is a thing."
shield,3cumtg,goodbrock,0,Sat Jul 11 19:49:55 2015 UTC,"A lot of mayo is made with olive oil. Hellmann's and Kraft aren't the only kind of mayo.

shield,3cuulb,offthebsides,1 point,Sat Jul 11 00:14:53 2015 UTC,"Damn, now I really hope he doesn't have an exclusivity clause preventing him from working with Marvel. If DC can get our Dum Dum Dugan, we should be able to get their Heatwave."
shield,3cuulb,eawhite,5,Sat Jul 11 02:37:11 2015 UTC,"For everyone who wants to read up on the character:  http://marvel.wikia.com/Lash_(Inhuman)_(Earth-616)  Looks like he's a bad-aligned Inhuman who hunts down new accidental Inhumans to determine if they deserve their transformation.  My guess, he'll have a similar storyline -- maybe a disgruntled Afterlife Inhuman who believed in the way Jiaying ran things as far as limiting Terrigenisis. I doubt he'll be a major player if they're telling us about him. Most likely, he'll be a one or two episode threat like Kreel."
shield,3cuulb,Bookbringer,2,Sat Jul 11 01:46:36 2015 UTC,He sounds like a pretty major threat. I bet he'll be the villain for at least the first half of the season.
shield,3cuulb,LambentEnigma,3,Sat Jul 11 02:09:10 2015 UTC,"In-Universe, maybe, but not if he's working alone. Meta, I doubt it."
shield,3cuulb,Bookbringer,2,Sat Jul 11 02:16:50 2015 UTC,What if he doesn't support Afterlife in general? It's probably not the only Inhuman community (aka Black Bolt's).
shield,3cuulb,superduperfastguy,2,Sun Jul 12 01:01:43 2015 UTC,"Lash in the comics is from a small community that strictly regulates Terrigenisis -- not unlike Afterlife. So unless they alter him/ his motivation, I can't see why he'd have a problem with Afterlife, per se.  Since their communities sound similar, I feel like it would make narrative sense to conserve detail by having him be from Afterlife.   But anything's possible."
shield,3cuulb,Bookbringer,1 point,Sun Jul 12 01:54:48 2015 UTC,"I think it'd be cool if they give it a different spin that has him working with the Secret Warriors at first to reach his own goal, but once they start disagreeing with him he goes solo and we run into him a few times later in the season here and there."
shield,3cuulb,dark3tar15,1 point,Sat Jul 11 10:02:44 2015 UTC,"Definitely would be an interesting twist, I just have a feeling his character will be a short-term villain, instead."
shield,3cuulb,Bookbringer,1 point,Sat Jul 11 15:22:21 2015 UTC,"They revealed Daniel Whitehall in last year's Comic-Con IIRC, why wouldn't Lash be a major player? For all we know the other party also  hunting down the new Inhumans is him and not Ward as was generally believed to be by the fandom."
shield,3cuulb,Demileto,2,Sat Jul 11 17:32:02 2015 UTC,"I can't defend it, it's just a feeling."
shield,3cuulb,Bookbringer,1 point,Sat Jul 11 21:05:42 2015 UTC,"Well, maybe he's doing that on behalf of someone else, but I don't think they'd announce him during SDCC without making him a major player, Lash's one of the new Inhumans added to the mythos by Charles Soule after the Terrigen Bomb was detonated in the comics, so it's on Marvel's best interests for these new characters to get a big promotion."
shield,3cuulb,Demileto,2,Sun Jul 12 09:47:41 2015 UTC,"I could see him working for someone else in the same way Kreel was working for Whitehall/ HYDRA. I still think he's likely to only do a few episodes, though. My main reasons for this hunch (and I fully acknowledge it's just a hunch) are:   I feel if he were a major player they'd be more likely to introduce the actor first, possibly as portraying a mysterious character (like they did with Gonzalez). Characters with heavy CGI/ prosthetic requirements just tend to have a shorter shelf-life. With the cast as big as it is, they're going to have a hard enough time fitting everyone in -- I expect most additions at this point will be minor characters."
shield,3cuulb,Bookbringer,1 point,Sun Jul 12 14:14:12 2015 UTC,"Being in a few episodes can be misleading, though: Daniel Whitehall was in 7 episodes total last season, by most accounts he had been ""in a few episodes"" only, yet condensing all of those in the first half season made his role to be relevant.   We shall see next season."
shield,3cuulb,Demileto,2,Sun Jul 12 14:25:13 2015 UTC,"By few, I mean I'd be surprised if he lasts longer than 3.  But anything is possible, of course.  I'm just expecting him to have a Kreel-like role -- being wicked cool and wicked threatening and providing the opportunity for awesome fight scenes, but that's it."
shield,3cuulb,Bookbringer,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:19:27 2015 UTC,"Well, one thing's for sure: Lash has a powerset to be a substantial threat to a SHIELD that only has Skye and Lincoln as a gifted assets so far. We shall see how long he lasts."
shield,3cuulb,Demileto,2,Sun Jul 12 20:26:27 2015 UTC,"Lash will almost certainly be a villain.  His powerset is that of energy conversion, besides the general Inhuman strength and durability.  In the comics he's done stuff like sticking a hand into lava and then pulling all that heat energy out and directing it at his enemies with the other.  His city of Orollan wasn't rich in terrigen crystals and thus had to dole them out sparingly and only in cases where they could be very, very, sure of a positive outcome/powerset. It's become a mystical thing for Orollan - including the 'cleansing' of failures; ""The work is done. The work begins anew"". Consequently he disapproves utterly of Maximus/Black Bolt's plan in the current comics of releasing a (safe for normies) world-wide terrigen cloud - though admittedly after Secret Wars is over that particular event is likely to be forgotten. Orollan also got severely depopulated in the Infinity War event when Thanos's son underwent terrigenesis and his exiting the cocoon killed everyone in sight.  Lash has been rebuilding his city since then.    Not quite sure how much of these stories will make it into AoS but it should be fun finding out.

Season four was boring and the first half of season five wasn't much of an improvement. I have the back half on my Sky+ box and am in no rush to watch it. Doctor Who's treatment of the Doctor as the guy who was also there needs urgent fixing.   I don't count Daredevil and House of Cards as those come and go in one weekend."

Arrow is not nearly as good as SHIELD and is really bogged down by relationship drama bullshit; Daredevil is probably a better show and I love it immensely, but I enjoy Agents of SHIELD more so far."

shield,3cyk3x,DNGTA,8,Sat Jul 11 23:11:18 2015 UTC,"You should watch the first Avengers movie.  The show picks up pretty soon after it and they do expect you to have seen it.  Fundamentally though the show is about the world reacting to the fact that comic book ideas like super heroes, villains and aliens are all real.    Asgard is the mythological home of the Norse gods, but in the Marvel universe they are just aliens who visited Earth thousands of years ago.   You should also watch the second Captain America movie between episodes 16 and 17.  No other movies affect the show very much."
shield,3cyk3x,KMBanana,3,Sun Jul 12 00:58:22 2015 UTC,Here is the viewing order for the Marvel Cinematic Universe:  http://shieldtv.net/marvel-cinematic-timeline-viewing-guide
shield,3cyk3x,Zuto9999,3,Sun Jul 12 07:37:53 2015 UTC,"The show assumes you have a base understanding of how the MCU world works. Ideally I recommend watching the (first) Avengers movie. It explains just about everything you might ever need without going in depth about it.   Thor in the MCU is for all intent and purposes an alien. Asgard is kind of like an alien planet. The norse religion was modeled after this alien race of Asgardians (not the other way around).   For the purposes of the show: Shield is kind of like the international special agency that deals with anything normal governments can't handle. Be it aliens, bomb threats, superheroes having a grudge match, etc.   If you are going to watch one movie in the MCU, watch the Avengers. It is really the major critical movie for the show. Second place would either be Captain America: Winter Soldier, or Captain America: First Avenger. Either one of them will give you the basis for the conflicts in the show going forward."
shield,3cyk3x,7percents,2,Sun Jul 12 14:39:40 2015 UTC,"You don't have to know what's going on -- everything will be explained in the show eventually. It's written so that it can be understood by anyone. That said, as a fan of comics, you will probably get a little kick out of recognizing minor characters/ artifacts/ plots (but most are adapted enough that it won't enable you to predict major stuff).  The movies, though not integral, are definitely useful. I strongly recommend watching Avengers 1 and 2 and Captain America. Events that happen in those movies totally affect the show in important ways. They do get explained in the show if you really can't watch the movies, but without seeing the events first hand, certain parts of the show might feel like an ass pull because all you get is a character vaguely explaining why everything's changed."
shield,3cyk3x,Bookbringer,3,Sun Jul 12 01:36:29 2015 UTC,I'd argue avengers one is close to mandatory. They do t explain the deal with coulson well for awhile. You're kind of just supposed to k ow the basics

shield,3crcck,AlphaAnt,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:15:44 2015 UTC,The belt color in most natural arts shows the person's rank in that martial art. It is typically earned through a combination of skill and a certain number of years experience.
shield,3crcck,grounded_astronaut,2,Fri Jul 10 20:50:27 2015 UTC,"So what color is his, and is it good?"
shield,3crcck,AlphaAnt,2,Fri Jul 10 21:20:20 2015 UTC,"In this picture, at least (I don't know if it's old), he's a brown belt. I know from twitter or interviews  or someplace that Clark practices Brazilian Jiu Jitsu. According to Wikipedia, ""brown belt is the highest ranking color belt in Brazilian jiu-jitsu. Brown belt typically requires at least five years of dedicated training to achieve."" (There's still black belts above him though.) So it looks like Clark Gregg has been doing this for quite a while, and has made it to a pretty high ranking, which I think is impressive considering he's a full-time actor. I remember a while back somebody interviewed him about it, and he said that it lets him do moves that they'd normally have a stunt double do and he was hopeful and excited that he'd maybe get to do something like a Flying Triangle on the show."

For the longest time, I thought this show would be gimmicky and derivative (just another superhero themed show). But the writers did a good job with the story, which actually moves forward without cheating and backpedaling on major events. Thus when people die, betrayal others, or have things happen to them, it feels more real and have more emotional weight.  Plus, the characters are great. FitzSimmons, Coulson, and amazing guest actors. Even characters I haven't liked previously, haven gotten much better over time. Skye kind of grows on you.  Have fun with season two! You're going to have the best time ever."

shield,3ci5dy,LordErebus,12,Wed Jul 8 02:25:18 2015 UTC,I'd really like to see Jessica Drew aka Spider-woman. It'd be cool to see her working as a Hydra agent only for Coulson to convince her that Hydra is evil and offer her a chance to redeem herself by joining SHIELD.
shield,3ci5dy,Gremzero,5,Wed Jul 8 02:42:29 2015 UTC,"Minor or lesser-known villains, mostly, especially as recruited by Ward.   The Tinkerer, Grim Reaper, the Wrecking Crew, Dr. Faustus (since they mentioned he devised the brainwashing method Whitehall favored). I'd like a bit of continuity that acknowledges Ward busted a hella ton of people out of the fridge with Garrett -- and the only one we know was recaptured was Marcus Daniels.  I'd also like to see Scarlotti/ Whiplash again, and Donnie/ Blizzard."
shield,3ci5dy,Bookbringer,4,Wed Jul 8 03:59:46 2015 UTC,"Actually, Dr. Faustus was already introduced to the MCU in Agent Carter."
shield,3ci5dy,Gremzero,1 point,Wed Jul 8 04:39:09 2015 UTC,Oh. Well... Hmn.   How about Karla Sofen/ Moonstone as his protege/ successor then?
shield,3ci5dy,Bookbringer,3,Wed Jul 8 05:28:02 2015 UTC,"The Druid. But the creators have been doing a great job making their own characters and taking too much from the source material can hurt the show. Quake, Lincoln, Deathlok, Druid, Yo-Yo, and Creel (if not Stonewall). That way there's a nice balance between established characters and new ones."
shield,3ci5dy,Hawkguy67,4,Wed Jul 8 02:47:10 2015 UTC,Personally none and before I get downvoted to hell listen to my reasoning. My reasoning is because of all the characters in AoS that means having to cut certain histories from  characters from the comics.  The writers pretty much destory comic book canon and do there own things with even minor characters like Absorbing Man who is fleshed out character in the comics who even has a wife that he loves and be quite respectful. In AoS he is just a minor Villain of the week. I like AoS but I feel like it should make up characters because it will not be able to give the proper attention to the many of the best marvel characters.
shield,3ci5dy,SwagBelow,8,Wed Jul 8 04:16:49 2015 UTC,"I understand your reasoning, but I disagree. The show has actually proven to us that it can take c-list/d-list characters and turn them into something more worthwhile and interesting(Mr. Hyde, Daisy Johnson, Whitehall, Garret, etc.) And all though its too early to say what the show runners have planned for the secret warriors, I have no doubt that they'll be an interesting aspect on the show.  Don't get me wrong, I love it when the show branches out and creates its own characters(Gordon, Ian Quinn, Raina), but I don't think the show shouldn't add characters from the comics simply because they can't do them justice. If anything, the show has an opportunity to introduce villains and heroes that the movies could never develop thoroughly because of limited screentime."
shield,3ci5dy,Gremzero,2,Wed Jul 8 04:53:42 2015 UTC,I get what you are saying with those shield characters but those are easy to do justice to because they have a history with the organization. But the kind of characters i meant were like the Spider Woman you mentioned. If AoS were to get that Character they would have to cut huge chunks from her origin and comicbook history away and destory the character and Marvel should not just use AoS to introduce super heroes since it is mostly a spy show. They have four other shows in the pipeline and with more coming.It makes sense to introduce superheroes in those shows than AoS.
shield,3ci5dy,SwagBelow,-1,Wed Jul 8 05:25:27 2015 UTC,Personally I think you're a fucking idiot. A show set in a universe not using characters in the universe. What a moronic move that would be.

shield,3cdzyf,dreamycreamy93,7,Tue Jul 7 16:18:47 2015 UTC,Yeah. This was a bloody fantastic episodes. One of the best of Season 1 imo.

shield,3ccxt7,Kichigai,26,Tue Jul 7 03:05:07 2015 UTC,"Nope, this sounds about right to me.  We did some work on season recaps for ABC Studios productions that aired the week before the season premiere (or some times in the time slot right before it).  If we did interviews we'd have to send people out on set to do them, and if we were using bits of the premiere as part of a tease we usually wouldn't get the final, color graded stuff with all the VFX until a couple days before we had to deliver (so we're talking like 10 days before the episode itself airs).  Shooting will be split up so scenes involving different characters and sets will be shot concurrently, with maybe two or three shoots going on simultaneously if possible.  Once the footage is shot it's off to a small army of assistant editors who immediately start logging it and assembling string-outs. Editors come in, and cull it down, and from there the producers and directors get involved in guiding the formation of the episodes. The VFX team does their stuff while the Pro Tools wizards are doing their thing.  At this point it's more mechanical than anything. They've got two years of this show under their belt, they know what the producers are looking for. The audio folk have their library of music and sounds, VFX has their set of models and templates (plus a lot of their old work can be easily recycled). Even the colorists already have their established library of looks to rely on for about 90% of the material (e.g. they've already graded a baseline of what Coulson's office looks like, so it's just a little finessing). So it's just cranking stuff out now.  Once they're done with that, kick it over to mastering, make a ProRes, toss it on ‘Monorail and watch Aspera Faspex soak up the bandwidth as it distributes the file to everyone who needs it. QC it, feed it through a cross converter (like an FS2 or Teranex) and shoot it out over satellite.  Boom, you're done. We almost did a half hour special in seven days, but our work was purely writing and editing, we didn't shoot anything."
shield,3ccxt7,redworm,11,Tue Jul 7 04:55:23 2015 UTC,Ok so...Season premier next week? Yay!
shield,3ccxt7,Kichigai,3,Tue Jul 7 05:19:12 2015 UTC,"Ha ha! For what it's worth, the writers probably already have an idea of what they're going to be doing this season, a very broad-strokes arc that they probably ran by the execs at Marvel and got the thumbs up on (to ensure cohesion in the MCU and the grander arcs for the upcoming Civil War, Infinity War, and Inhumans movies in Phase 3. This is writing the actual individual episode scripts, the nuts and bolts of lines, scenes, jokes, etc."

shield,3ccxt7,Kichigai,3,Tue Jul 7 06:58:19 2015 UTC,"I understand enough to both want to join and stay away from this industry.   In what way?   On the one hand, it's awesome, on the other hand, money.   IMHO, it's not money that's not good, it's more the side stuff you don't even think about. For example, I can't watch 95% of what's on TV. It's too obviously fabricated for me.  It's a very truthful thing to say we ""manufacture"" TV in this day and age. If it's not live TV then it's been edited to be exactly what the producers want it to be, and for shows that aren't obviously scripted (e.g. dramas, sitcoms, etc) that makes it very jarring and almost disingenuous to me.  If you're on a TV show we will make you say whatever we want you to say. If you don't see someone on screen speaking the entire time then they likely never said those words in that order. For the most part, in what we do, we don't go overly extreme, but we will condense entire paragraphs down to one or two lines to make someone seem so much more interesting and eloquent, even if that means rearranging their thoughts. We'll even go so far as to steal mispronounced words from other questions.  Now, we don't take this so far as to fabricate events or sentiments or anything like that, but many reality shows will. They'll manipulate the way someone phrased something in order to make them seem more ignorant or offensive. They'll steal reaction shots from different parts of a conversation to make someone seem more outraged.  So knowing what I know, when I watch a TV show I'm picking out where they're stealing a bunch of B-roll to cover up all this Frankensteining, or listening for poorly recorded pick-up lines (yes, sometimes shows will have talent go in and record stuff just to fill a hole). It makes reality shows impossibly grating to watch, and even shows like Shark Tank are difficult, because even Mark Cuban's enthusiastic ""Wow"" may not have even been for this pitch, or Mr. Wonderful's incredulous look may have even been in response to something said by one of the sharks. Awkward, poignant, or dramatic silences will clearly have added to hype up the drama. It just feels a bit too fake to me."

shield,3ccxt7,rleclair90,2,Tue Jul 7 07:07:21 2015 UTC,Not really. I'm not even in TV/film production and I'm fairly certain this is how most shows work. Episodes are still being filmed even as the season airs.

shield,3ccdz3,whizzer0,15,Mon Jul 6 21:24:00 2015 UTC,This is exactly why people pirate things and also exactly why many incredibly popular geeky/interesting/cult shows end up being cancelled early.   You only have to look at the success of every film/show/game with world wide release on the same day to see how fundamentally backward the current system is.   Any fan of the MCU (outside of the US) who hasn't pirated this must have more willpower than anyone I know. It's only possible to avoid spoilers if you also avoid the internet in general which just gives people more of a reason to find a way to watch things as soon as they're available somewhere in the world.
shield,3ccdz3,Mortis2000,5,Mon Jul 6 22:03:51 2015 UTC,I haven't pirated it because I'm strongly against piracy. I don't feel much loss and haven't been spoiled.  Is that a problem?
shield,3ccdz3,whizzer0,3,Tue Jul 7 09:56:02 2015 UTC,Not at all. Do you have access to the channel to watch it when it's on? It's brilliant and we'll worth a watch.

shield,3ccdz3,Mortis2000,2,Tue Jul 7 14:24:05 2015 UTC,"I haven't pirated it. But that's only because I wasn't really interested, but then I kept hearing good things about it and I thought I would wait for HD quality of it, unfortunately I didn't think it would take this long to get to the UK.   I've still waited though and I'm excited, I've kept away from spoilers (this is why I wanted AC to have a separate subreddit).  I feel bad for the people the who don't have access to this channel though (which are quite a few). AoS went to Channel 4, which is one of the big top 5 channels avaliable for free to everyone who has a TV, unfortunately Fox is on Sky (a monthly subscription fee that could cost up to hundreds every month), maybe BT or Virgin but I'm not too sure as I've never had these. I guess Sky and the other two are the equivalent to cable for the US."
shield,3ccdz3,dreamycreamy93,2,Tue Jul 7 15:58:21 2015 UTC,"This is the problem. When it's a show which is part of a franchise aimed at tech savvy people and then they wait this long, it's not pitching to the demographic."
shield,3ccdz3,dreamycreamy93,4,Tue Jul 7 16:31:30 2015 UTC,"I can't believe how long it's taken to air here... And for the first half of S1 of AoS we were getting the episodes 3 days after America (then it's always taken ages for the second half and the whole of S2 for some reason), so it's definitely possible to get it quicker than this.  Also, it's on Fox, which a lot of people don't have, so that sucks even more for them.  I can see why people pirate this stuff, or even just buy it online after it finished in America.  I wasn't interested in it enough to pirate when it came out, but I've heard good things and it's only a short series, so I'll definitely check it out! But they should have just aired AoS at roughly the same time as America and put this in the mid season break. I honestly don't know why they didn't, or that Channel 4 didn't buy it (who show AoS).  And I'm still waiting for AoS to hit Netflix UK (first and second season)."

Skye is bigger than the others and kind of above them. I assume that means she'll be more prominent? Not exactly surprising cuz Secret Warriors is her deal, but an interesting artistic choice. Coulson's hand. Wow... Creepy. Is that Lola fleeing the explosion? Ward still looks like he's been crying for a month, which I find intriguing and surprising.

shield,3caur3,your_mind_aches,8,Mon Jul 6 22:49:00 2015 UTC,I know... That's why I said that.
shield,3caur3,Bookbringer,5,Mon Jul 6 16:08:55 2015 UTC,"Well, he is a demented psychopath that has killed or nearly been killed by everything he ever cared about"
shield,3caur3,Dogpool,15,Mon Jul 6 16:09:27 2015 UTC,"Ward has definitely lost everyone he ever cared about through a combination of terrible circumstances beyond his control and horrible, horrible choices he made, but I wouldn't call him either demented or a psychopath. And I still think it's interesting that he appears to be grieving -- not just angry, but very clearly sad --  just compared to his reaction to Skye/the team's rejection (not that upset) and Garrett's death (initially suicidal, then pretty much over it)."
shield,3caur3,Bookbringer,9,Mon Jul 6 16:30:24 2015 UTC,"I'd say the whole Mockingbird incident was fairly demented. You make a good point. Skye rejecting him, betraying the team, and Garret being dead didn't really seem to bug him all that much. Killing his girlfriend, though, seems to have really shaken him. Makes me wonder if he'll blame May and Bobbi or accept it was his doing."
shield,3caur3,Dogpool,4,Mon Jul 6 16:34:32 2015 UTC,"Appearances can be deceiving, though. It could very well be that all of these things you mentioned did affect him, it just happened that he buried the pain that came from them deep down like he did with those from his family life for the fifteen years he lived as Garrett's apprentice."
shield,3caur3,Demileto,2,Mon Jul 6 19:15:08 2015 UTC,"OK, how are you using demented? Because literally, it has to do with being super confused, forgetful, unable to think straight. Ward is disturbed and twisted for sure, and has an element of troll logic to his reason, but is generally perfectly rational and capable of complex, intelligent thought."
shield,3caur3,Bookbringer,1 point,Tue Jul 7 00:28:39 2015 UTC,"Just vernacular, not necessarily the dictionary verbatim use of the term."
shield,3caur3,Dogpool,3,Tue Jul 7 02:08:47 2015 UTC,"IDK, the Mockingbird thing makes sense to me. (DISCLAIMER: I don't approve of torture). Ward's experience is that the damage from a trauma can linger long after the abuse has stopped, that this can prevent a person from healing, and that the best way to facilitate healing is to make the responsible party admit and pay for what they've done. And given how killing his family helped him and his brainwashing Bakshi helped Kara... Well, it's hard to argue with results."
shield,3caur3,Bookbringer,2,Tue Jul 7 03:25:03 2015 UTC,"Okay. Let's not go into semantics arguments. The point is Ward is fucked int the head and extremely devious and dangerous. His logic makes sense for him, but in my line of thinking he should be considered sympathetic. He is a bad person. If he wanted Mockingbird to own up to her shit, he did it the wrong way. He's bloody minded and can't find a solution that doesn't involve violence."
shield,3caur3,Dogpool,4,Tue Jul 7 03:39:58 2015 UTC,"Am I the only one that wants to see a Skye and Ward reunion where they just talk? It doesn't even have to be about him betraying them. It could be about puppies, ice cream, or even her powers. I actually miss Grant interacting with the team civilly. I didn't think the Dirt Half Dozen episode had enough interactions between him and everyone."

It would feel weird w/ Skye and Ward. Coulson might be able to pull that off -- he has a very different relationship with Ward and the ability to be chummy with enemies. Maybe if Ward is in a position to destroy the world..."
shield,3caur3,Bookbringer,2,Mon Jul 6 21:31:46 2015 UTC,"See that's what I hate. I feel like they have pushed Ward's character so far from redemption that he can't even get a chat in with the other characters cause they all hate him. It's understandable with the things he's done and stuff he continues to do....but it frustrates me because a tiny part of me wants Ward to be a grizzly and kickass with Skye. I actually hate Ward's character now and I want him to be killed off...I feel like they have destroyed his character. That's just me though, everyone feels differently."
shield,3caur3,NinjaPixies,1 point,Tue Jul 7 01:47:42 2015 UTC,"Personally, I love and support Ward's character now more than ever. I feel where you're coming from, but I don't agree they've destroyed his character. He isn't who he seemed to be at the end of S1 (a soldier guy who was similar to his get-it-done, follow-orders-without-question cover except that he was loyal to a bad person). But who he's been revealed to be is still, IMO, easily reconciled with who he was and what he did. I look forward to Ward forming his own team/ family. Hopefully, they will finally accept him for who is -- a bearded killing machine who will sacrifice anything and anyone (himself included) for the right person.  And then maybe he can have a light chat with them about ice cream or whatever."
shield,3caur3,Bookbringer,3,Tue Jul 7 02:25:28 2015 UTC,"I agree on psychopath, but demented? I think there's quite a bit of that in Ward, it's just that he's well versed in concealing it."
shield,3caur3,Demileto,5,Mon Jul 6 19:07:52 2015 UTC,"Technically, demented is related to having dementia -- ie extreme confusion, forgetfulness (not just for old people). But even if we're being less specific, I'd point out that while he is extremely twisted and disturbed, he is always quite rational, making complicated, intelligent plans and adjusting them to achieve his twisted, disturbing goals."
shield,3caur3,Bookbringer,1 point,Mon Jul 6 21:50:08 2015 UTC,"Then I replace ""demented"" for ""deranged"" or ""insane"". Point being, he may be rational and intelligent but he's far from being sane. :)"
shield,3caur3,Demileto,2,Mon Jul 6 21:53:59 2015 UTC,He burned his entire family. I think that qualifies as psychopath.
shield,3caur3,catdoctor,4,Mon Jul 6 18:53:32 2015 UTC,"Not his entire family, just those that abused him, Thomas and the so-called sister are notably absent from the death count. :)  But really, I'm on a wait and see on this particular plot point: Ward's older brother and parents are not random soldiers or doctors that matter very little to the storyline, they're to Ward's story what Jiaying was to Skye's, and after Jiaying was revealed to be very much alive in ""Afterlife"" after we saw Whitehall removing her organs and Cal holding her dead body in the flashbacks of the very same episode the Wards died I'm pretty skeptical about their deaths when we didn't see a single corpse on screen. News reports can be faked and Christian has enough political power to be able to do so, I can definitely see the show not being done with them yet."
shield,3caur3,Demileto,3,Mon Jul 6 19:44:41 2015 UTC,"Depends on how precise you're being. Ward's actions, particularly killing most of his family, show that he is a violent, twisted, disturbed, and morally stunted individual. However psychopath isn't just psycho-babble for any person who does evil, violent things. It's a specific statement diagnosis that, IMO, Ward doesn't meet the criteria for.  On the other hand, the show has definitely used official psychiatric designations before that are straight up wrong (for example Bobbi's assessment that Bakshi has Borderline Personality Disorder is pretty much ridiculous. Anyone who's ever met a BPD person or done a basic google search can see that.) So maybe the writers mean him to be a psychopath and are just using the word wrong."
shield,3caur3,Bookbringer,1 point,Tue Jul 7 00:26:28 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't call him either demented or a psychopath   He defs has many psychopathic traits - according to my expert opinion formed by skimming a couple of Wikipedia articles. The easy superficial charisma, manipulation, lying (mainly about his allegiance though, not compulsive lying), lack of remorse, lack of responsibility (blaming others for his actions), lack of empathy, juvenile delinquency and antisocial behaviour, promiscuous sex (with May).  Prior to him expressing grief over Agent 33, I would have said yeah, he's a total psychopath. Since then, because it seems to indicate some kind of love or empathy for her, I'm not sure."
shield,3caur3,01111000marksthespot,3,Tue Jul 7 04:12:32 2015 UTC,"How is having sex with May promiscuous? Is she promiscuous too then? Besides, he was undercover and trying to throw her off his scent. When left to his own devices, he clearly prefers serious monogamous relationships and has never been shown seeking shallow flings.    Lack of empathy is debatable. It's a possible explanation for the easy way he lies and kills, but IMO, not the best one. Given that he shows real empathy for people he relates to like Kara and Garrett, I'd argue he may just have an exaggeration of normal in-group bias, rather than an incapacity for empathy. Or, possibly, he uses the same psychological mechanism the other characters use to not lose sleep over killing bad people like HYDRA agents-- it's not that they can't feel empathy (obviously), but that they feel justified because they know they're saving civilians and fellow agents by doing so.  Ward may feel at peace with killing because he knows he's protecting Garrett or Kara by doing so (note: this doesn't change the morality of his actions, but it's relevant to his psyche).  Regarding remorse, he definitely feels remorse over the Well, in spite of believing he's not responsible. I still find it interesting that his worst ever memory is something bad he did rather than something that was done to him.  Regarding the charisma, manipulation, and lying -- he's a spy on a spy show, so it's kind of hard to judge. I'd call him on par with the other characters, lying when he's undercover and being more himself when he's not. In fact, he seems to be honest even in situations when lying would benefit him much more, which really doesn't make sense for a psychopath.  All his little remarks that became clues in hindsight, his confession to Skye that he wasn't a good man before his cover was blown, admitting that he's the one who hurt Thomas. And especially after Garrett's death, the fact that he spent his prison time openly admitting he didn't ""want forgiveness"" and ""accepted what [he'd] done and why"" when, IMO, a real psychopath would have portrayed the ""I'm so sorry, I was tricked and now I'm full of remorse"" card. Plus, given that psychopaths are fundamentally selfish and incapable of forming long-term relationships or putting others first, Ward dedicating 15 years, his entire adult life, to Garrett, sacrificing everything he wants with no promise of reward... is just pretty incompatible with an actual psychopath."
shield,3caur3,Bookbringer,6,Tue Jul 7 07:18:59 2015 UTC,"About (6). It's been my opinion since season 2 ended that the Ward we see when we next meet him would be more akin to the berserker-staff-affected one in ""The Well"", violently lashing at everything and everyone as a way to cope with the pain, than the cold and calculating assassin we've been seeing since the series began, reason being that his current state of mind, after having all that ever mattered to him taken brutally away, would be very much similar to the one that led to him burning down the family house all those years ago if we are to assume that it was triggered by Thomas's ""suicide"" as I do. As such, this depiction makes sense to me."
shield,3caur3,Demileto,3,Mon Jul 6 19:36:11 2015 UTC,"Re: Ward's Berserker-like rage -- I completely agree and think he might go one step further and actually use the staff again (after stealing it back from SHIELD/ recovering it).  Re: the backstory. One of the best arguments for the Lincoln = Thomas theory is that he admits to having started an accidental fire when he first got his powers, which would make him responsible for the fire that landed Ward in juvie."
shield,3caur3,Bookbringer,1 point,Mon Jul 6 21:43:56 2015 UTC,"Eh, I don't know about that. Why would Grant steal a car and drive more than 1000 miles to the family house for, then? To watch Thomas do the burning? Doesn't make much sense to me."
shield,3caur3,Demileto,2,Mon Jul 6 21:59:21 2015 UTC,"I'm assuming he had a non-rage reason to come home, ie to save or stop Thomas. Assuming Thomas is Lincoln and Lincoln did the fire, which are both biiiig ifs.  Or, maybe we're over thinking it and everything is basically as it seems. But it seems weird that his rage would've struck spontaneously while he was at school and couldn't be contained long enough to wait for the next holiday, yet a 1000 mile drive did nothing to cool it down."
shield,3caur3,Bookbringer,1 point,Tue Jul 7 00:33:46 2015 UTC,"Nah, we'll probably get closer to the truth by overthinking than taking everything as it seems to be. :)  Brett Dalton was wasted in season 2, he missed 8 out of 22 episodes and in a few of the remaining 14 he was present for a merely 1 scene, all of that while still being a regular. Either the showrunners' don't mind wasting money in an actor whose character is barely meriting regular status at this point or, as I'd like to think, Brett's in for a big storyline next season, and there's no story bigger for the character of Grant Ward than that of his family. As such, I expect the backstory to be far more complex and connected to the mythology of the show than we've been led to believe so far, hence why I keep thinking out-of-the-box theories like Christian being a) secretly alive, b) a HYDRA head and c) already an evolved Inhuman with the power of mind control. :)"

shield,3caur3,rpmaluki,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:14:10 2015 UTC,"I love it. I don't want to read too much into Bobbi being outside the circle but maybe it's because of what happened in S.O.S. and they want to lay a better foundation for the spinoff.   They better not hurt Lola!   And I'm really curious to know if Coulson's hand has any nifty cool other worldly tricks, I hope so. And can the man be any cooler than he already is? I don't think but he seems bent to prove me wrong."

Oops. #SpoilerAlert"" I don't know what to make of this. Is he just ""speculating"" like all the fans without actually spoiling Coulson's new hand or will Coulson actually grow a new limb because of the Kree juice in his system? It's too much to hope that he grows the new limb but if I had to choose between that and a bionic hand, I'd opt for the newly minted Kree arm, lol.  Sorry for the double post."
shield,3caur3,ZachsMind,2,Mon Jul 6 21:34:39 2015 UTC,"My inner child says he will tell everyone it's a bionic hand, but next time sweeps comes around it'll be revealed to be Kree. And everyone will be mad at him again cuz again he's not coming clean with everybody.   However, my more mature gut tells me they're gonna put the ""Tahiti Protocol"" largely behind him. It was supposed to explain how he didn't die in the movie. It wasn't supposed to define him."
shield,3caur3,Eleanor1984,1 point,Tue Jul 7 00:27:21 2015 UTC,Except the writers are pretty big on consequences. It doesn't have to define him but he can't escape the consequences or side effects of what was done to him. There is a price to pay.
shield,3caur3,ZachsMind,1 point,Tue Jul 7 08:06:13 2015 UTC,"Agreed, but its a well that for me has run dry. There's already been consequences. The whole etching Into walls thing. Do they want to make Coulson able to regenerate now? Doesn't that make putting him in jeopardy even less suspenseful than it already is? Frankly a gadget hand fits his personality more."
shield,3caur3,dpfw,1 point,Tue Jul 7 12:57:43 2015 UTC,"I only wanted to respond to the 2nd half of your comments. That is, the Tahiti stuff might pop up in the future, as and when it suits the storyline. A reminder to Coulson and the viewers of the ramifications of such a radical method to bring someone back to life. So it was more of a generalization and not specifically just about the Kree hand. Personally, I would think a robotic hand is way cooler as you can do so much more with gadgets."
shield,3caur3,Scorpion197,1 point,Wed Jul 8 22:40:31 2015 UTC,"it will boil down to story potential. if they have a ""long con"" plan with the tahiti stuff they'll keep that ball in the air but i'm hoping they have more interesting stuff to focus on. I agree a bionic hand is much more intriguing, opens up more possibilities than a Kree hand would. It also echoes back to beginning of this season when Agent Hartley touched the obelisk and was losing her hand and Hunter cut it off for her to save her life just before Absorbing Man wrecked their car. Mac cut off Coulson's hand after he touched the crystal, saving his life. Fortunately they weren't speeding away in an SUV at the time.   Gadget hand much cooler than alien hand, but you know they're gonna keep us guessing as long as they can. Maybe there's a third possibility we haven't even imagined yet."

shield,3cbbvj,Arknell,9,Mon Jul 6 17:23:50 2015 UTC,Maybe for Infinity War?
shield,3cbbvj,hardgeeklife,12,Mon Jul 6 17:28:23 2015 UTC,No i don't want to see that in Captain America Civil War. I want to the Avengers and Heroes like Black Panther and Spiderman.We see Shield for 22 hours and not like to see him when watching a film.The whole point of Secret Warriors is to be secret and not fight in a civil war between superheroes.Shield does not need to cross over with the films or shows it can do it's own thing.
shield,3cbbvj,SwagBelow,16,Mon Jul 6 17:09:24 2015 UTC,I wouldn't mind seeing this in Infinity War though
shield,3cbbvj,AStrangerWCandy,-10,Mon Jul 6 17:23:49 2015 UTC,Why? Infinity War should be the considered the last story for the Avengers and all the characters built up in the films.It does not need to be how many cameos can they fit in 2 hours.Coulson and the secret warriors whole MO is about being secret so it will ve Ok if they are not in Infinity War.
shield,3cbbvj,SwagBelow,11,Mon Jul 6 17:48:11 2015 UTC,Because that's the spirit of the Infinity Gauntlet series it's based off of. It's the MU vs Thanos with nothing held back because of the scale of the threat. A massive invasion of all of Earth not just NYC. Everyone is affected. I envision Infinity War as a grand crossover of the entire MCU with the core Avengers as the tip of the spear. Just the Avengers vs Thanos and his army isn't really believable.
shield,3cbbvj,AStrangerWCandy,-3,Mon Jul 6 19:36:34 2015 UTC,But its not just the Avengers said all the movies. That means the Guardians of the Galaxy and that universe plus all the supporting characters of all the other characters like Spiderman and Captain Marvel.The Infinity War should involve all of those characters. The Avengers don't even know Coulson is alive so why and try to and shoe him in.
shield,3cbbvj,SwagBelow,11,Mon Jul 6 19:59:25 2015 UTC,"Because it actually brings the story of the Avengers full circle. They became a team after Coulson got stabbed through the heart by Loki. After Ultron, CW, Ragnarok etc.... fractures them again Coulson returning with the cavalry in Infinity War part 1 to turn the tide on an invasion of Earth and bring them back together again would actually tie together the movies nicely."
shield,3cbbvj,AStrangerWCandy,10,Mon Jul 6 20:01:27 2015 UTC,"Or you could have the cool cliffhanger ending to part one, where the avengers + whoever else are just getting their butts kicked and starting to lose hope and all of the sudden Coulson shows up with his team. Credit Roll"
shield,3cbbvj,Star_Lord72,-4,Mon Jul 6 20:12:27 2015 UTC,Why make Coulsons team look more badass then the Avengers who are the world's greatest heroes. That makes no sense.
shield,3cbbvj,SwagBelow,13,Mon Jul 6 20:23:03 2015 UTC,"Because, maybe, just maybe, that's just what I want to happen. Coulson is my favorite character and nothing is going to change that."
shield,3cbbvj,Star_Lord72,0,Mon Jul 6 20:27:27 2015 UTC,Secret Warriors helping to turn the tide doesn't make them the greatest hero in the same way Gandalf is not the greatest hero over either Aragorn or Frodo when he returns in Two Towers
shield,3cbbvj,AStrangerWCandy,5,Tue Jul 7 21:15:45 2015 UTC,May hates that nickname.
shield,3cbbvj,3dDeters,-4,Tue Jul 7 00:24:46 2015 UTC,No it does not. Coulson should not be the one doing that. It should be Captain America turning the tie of a War or an Avenger.The team does not need one guy to unite them. The Avengers will be fine with out him.
shield,3cbbvj,SwagBelow,10,Mon Jul 6 20:09:47 2015 UTC,I disagree that it makes more sense story wise. The Secret Warriors/Coulson SHIELD is what Thanos would not be able to anticipate or calculate for. Moreover I maintain that Coulson reappearance makes much more sense from a story arc perspective of tying the films together.
shield,3cbbvj,AStrangerWCandy,-6,Mon Jul 6 21:06:29 2015 UTC,Shield does not even know about the Infinity Stones and would do nothing against Thanos.The secret warriors will at default be weaker then the Avengers so it does  not matter that if Coulson intervenes.
shield,3cbbvj,SwagBelow,4,Mon Jul 6 21:12:34 2015 UTC,"I'm going to go out on a limb and say you've never read Secret Invasion, Infinity Gauntlet or Secret Warriors and possibly haven't watched S2 of AoS"
shield,3cbbvj,AStrangerWCandy,4,Mon Jul 6 22:59:37 2015 UTC,"Well they were secret until Nick Fury showed up with them during Secret Invasion to kick ass. So if we have an entire season that shows Coulson building the team, it would be like the lead-up in Secret War and Mighty Avengers that led to Secret Warriors."
shield,3cbbvj,SwagBelow,-6,Mon Jul 6 17:11:47 2015 UTC,It's  way different though. Fury showed up because he was investigating the Skrulls. Coulson and the secret warriors have no need to show up since they have nothing to do with civil war.
shield,3cbbvj,meme-com-poop,4,Mon Jul 6 17:19:52 2015 UTC,How exactly does the team who has a running index of super-powered beings including some they've recruited themselves not fit into a story about registering super-powered beings and recruiting them?
shield,3cbbvj,SwagBelow,2,Mon Jul 6 18:25:34 2015 UTC,"a story about registering super-powered beings and recruiting them?   Because from all accounts, that's not what movie Civil War will be about?"

Also how outdated Reddit is for the mods, with mods trying to contact them with with improvements or suggestions with little success.  It's truly (obviously) up to you if you want to make this sub private (even though in the other thread, most people said yes to it) or even just read only like other subreddits have done, but it's not just about Victoria, it's bigger than that. I don't think it matters if it's a big subreddit or not, it still makes a difference (and the subreddit isn't too affected as the show isn't on at the moment). However, whatever you choose, I respect your decision.  For the people who aren't moderator's and want to protest, don't give gold and put adblock on.

I never said they needed an explanation for how they work or why they let Victoria go, that is their business, not ours.  I'm just stating that it was bad of them to not inform the AMA subreddit that Victoria wasn't working for Reddit anymore, and therefore they will need to sort out the AMAs themselves. The admins should have informed them instead of letting them find out by themselves, because as far as they were aware, nothing had happened/changed. It just left them in a very difficult and confusing position about how to handle this with no notice.  The whole Victoria thing is unfortunate but I'm not talking about that in my post.

Reddit wouldn't be what it is if it weren't for the users putting effort into creating great content - including this one. How many trolls are posting spoilers? I honestly don't know and that's because we have mods that filter them out. We have mods that create a nice theme to this sub. That create neat features like the upquotes and flairs. That makes this a great place to discuss a show we love.   They do this for free.   This is a pretty small sub and compared to (no disrespect mods) the work of a massive subreddit like Iama (which arguably brings in the most ""outside"" attention to reddit) put in it pales. Over the normal sub moderating they co-ordinate with tons of PR people and celebrities and all that to make AMAs go smoothly for both parties.   They too do this for free.   The admins and other people in charge of Reddit Co owe their jobs (and money) to the people who make up and contribute to reddit. So yes they owe the mods some explanation. Not all things but  let's start with an apology and a plan to move forward at the very least (which have only been promised as of now but previous experience say we shouldn't be surprised if it wasn't followed through).

Victoria being fired isn't why subs are closing. People keep mentioning her for the obvious reasons, but that's beside the point. Way is it an icredibly dumb idea to block this sub, when by joining in, we'd be doing our part, albiet a small part, in helping to improve the community?  Like I said, I'm not trying to be confrontational or anything. From what I've seen, the subs going private leads to better tools for you and other mods, and helps our subreddit in the long run.

shield,3c0edt,junglemonkey47,19,Fri Jul 3 20:18:15 2015 UTC,Can we all stop using project TAHITI to change characters into other characters.
shield,3c0edt,SwagBelow,3,Fri Jul 3 17:25:01 2015 UTC,I totally agree I understand the use of tahiti as a plot device but it should not be the reason that everything happens
shield,3c0edt,rachel_5199,4,Sun Jul 5 04:19:52 2015 UTC,Yeah. Since Project TAHITI came out people have want to use this thing to change people on AoS into people from the comics. I hope they don't use it like that. Just let the characters be themselves.
shield,3c0edt,SwagBelow,5,Sun Jul 5 04:40:27 2015 UTC,"Um... OK, I'm going to try to unravel what you said because it's not totally clear.  Are you suggesting that Dr. Tony Masters invented a technology that SHIELD modified into the TAHITI program? And that Garrett somehow subjected Dr. Masters to it, making him think he was Grant Ward, abused middle child of a prominent political family? So that Grant Ward isn't actually himself, but a brainwashed doctor?  And that the stress of these two personas caused him to develop a third persona, the Taskmaster?  Because that's what it sounds like and that makes no sense.  Grant Ward is Grant Ward.  He met his brother. His brother recognized him and shared many of the same memories.  He cannot secretly be Dr. Tony or anyone else.  If Ward is already brainwashed, it is not the kind of brainwashing where los your memories and think you're someone else.  Now, if he becomes Taskmaster, I think there will probably be an element of memory wipe to it. Either through TAHITI or through side effects of an attempt to enhance him.  Also, how has Coulson weaponized TAHITI? He used it to give dying people a new lease on life and a very troubled, drug-damaged man a do-over."
shield,3c0edt,Bookbringer,2,Fri Jul 3 19:42:02 2015 UTC,"No, no, no.  The brother is Taskmaster.  Ward is the Red Skull."
shield,3c0edt,Friendly_B,1 point,Sat Jul 4 05:04:11 2015 UTC,"Sorry I was on my cell phone and in a hurry.  Any way there is a possibility, Christian and the rest of Ward's family I assume haven't seen Grant Ward since the fire. When Ward was a kid I also doubt they kept tabs so I imagine a complete stranger could impersonate Ward and they'd never know. We also don't know if TAHITI is capable of copying/transferring memories(been watching Doll House on Netflix) to someone.  As for the why. Maybe Hydra needed an in to Ward's family so they made their own Grant Ward I mean they had senator's in their pocket maybe The Ward family seriously connected and they wanted in on the action but something happened to the real Grant Ward and they needed a replacement. Maybe Tony just had the misfortune of looking like Ward or something.  As for weaponizing I admit that's probably a exaggeration but you can't deny that what happened to Cal (assuming it was done without consent) was wrong. Also if Cal didn't agree to  it then his civil rights were violated. Also the fact that Coulson tries strong arming Ward into it hints at serious potential misuse.  If TAHITI is like the Atom Bomb and I suspect it might be, because really who designs a memory machine and why? I seriously think that might not have been it's true purpose. It could have been originally built for Alzheimer's patients, or even people with brain damage until the military/government stepped in and like the Atom Bomb(which I think started out as research for alternate energy sources) decided to use it for less than honorable reasons and if it's not being used for it's original purpose there might complications not even Coulson is aware of.  For example Cal is Mr. Hyde in the comics potential complications might cause him to develop multiple personalities like his real self and this fake persona."
shield,3c0edt,Bookbringer,1 point,Fri Jul 3 21:08:27 2015 UTC,"I imagine a complete stranger could impersonate Ward and they'd never know.    Nothing in their interactions suggests this -- Christian recognizes Ward right away and never doubts he's him for a second. Also, HYDRA never makes use of the connection so it seems kind of silly to impersonate someone well-known (or connected to the well-known), especially when brainwashing the real Grant Ward to serve HYDRA would have been easier.   We also don't know if TAHITI is capable of copying/transferring memories(been watching Doll House on Netflix) to someone.   That would be interesting, but still, straight up brainwashing the person with the desired memories seems more practical.  And TAHITI sans consent does pose an ethical dilemma, but Cal's conversation with Daisy shows he clearly knows what will happen, he doesn't seem to object.  Ward also speaks as if he has the choice between TAHITI and imprisonment. While that may seem like a crappy choice from his perspective, it's actually pretty generous of Coulson. Ward is a fugitive wanted for many counts of murder, international terrorism, and treason. He's lucky TAHITI or death aren't his options.   It could have been originally built for Alzheimer patients, or even people with brain damage until the military/government stepped in and... decided to use it for less than honorable reasons...   Reasonable speculation, but so far we've only seen it used to help consenting people with brain damage, so it's probably being used pretty close to its original purpose. Also, Coulson was obviously studying it extensively in the flashbacks and some of the people went through the procedure years ago, so you'd think they'd have noticed adverse effects.   For example Cal is Mr. Hyde in the comics potential complications might cause him to develop multiple personalities like his real self and this fake persona.   If he does, it's likely due to some side effect of his formula (and the lingering damage) that is unfixed by TAHITI or interacts with it."

shield,3c0edt,rachel_5199,1 point,Fri Jul 3 19:45:49 2015 UTC,yeah i think it would be pretty hard to mess with Tahiti more since the effects or at least the more adverse ones have been demonstrated and just creating and dog piling on more theories would be silly.

No Skye being the one to get through to Ward. No flirty banter. Nothing. If they want to use the nanomask or shapeshifty powers to have Brett and Chloe make out again, fine, but those two characters are done. 1. All about the heroes storylines.  Sure, things got awesome when CA:TWS took the battle to the heroes, making it essentially a fight to survive, but SHIELD was founded in the idea of protection. I want to see them actually protecting people again. Not just themselves, but civilians. 2. New characters at the expense of the old. New people are fine, but not if it means I have to go a couple episodes without any real story for Ward or Simmons again. 3. Character derailment of any kind, esp. to serve the plots of other characters. I feel like this happened to Simmons last season, and now I worry it will happen to Ward next."

shield,3bxwke,Spoonsandturtles,22,Fri Jul 3 02:59:18 2015 UTC,"I agree. It's not that I don't want Ward on the show, it's just that I want Ward as a full villain on the show. (And hopefully his fans will finally recognise and embrace the fact that Ward's a villain. An evil villain.)"
shield,3bxwke,Bookbringer,14,Fri Jul 3 03:10:38 2015 UTC,"Yes! Ward's a brilliant villain, just don't pretend he's murdering people out of love and tragedy or whatever bullshit they use to justify his actions."
shield,3bxwke,Timetmannetje,22,Fri Jul 3 03:22:48 2015 UTC,"Well, there's a difference between saying his motives are love/tragedy and his motives justify his crimes.  Love (or friendship/ loyalty/ gratitude) was definitely the reason for everything he did for Garrett and for Kara, but that doesn't make his actions right. It isn't morally OK to kill innocent people just to save your dying friend or help your girlfriend get her face back, even if you're only doing it because you really, really love them.  Similarly, Ward's tragic past most likely did make him the way he is. He probably never would've become a killer if Garrett hadn't trained and isolated him for 5 years, and he probably wouldn't have gone with Garrett if his family situation hadn't been such a mess. In better circumstances, he would have been a better man, but that doesn't mean we can pretend he is a better man or that he isn't also making bad choices. It's a tragedy, not a justification."
shield,3bxwke,Bookbringer,3,Fri Jul 3 04:31:41 2015 UTC,I think that's what makes Ward so great. He has done so much evil stuff and he is still fully convinced he hasn't lost it and is doing good things. Kind off like Cyclops has been recently in the comics.
shield,3bxwke,LindyKatelyn,11,Sat Jul 4 19:46:35 2015 UTC,"IMO, it depends on how it's done and how you define redemption.  I definitely don't Ward to get an, ""Oh, you still care about somebody? Here's a get out of jail free card!"" type redemption, or even a Darth Vader-esque, ""Oh, you've massacred whole planets, but hey, you won't kill your son. You die a good man!""  But seeing him acknowledge and even come to regret his crimes would, IMO, be a lot more satisfying than watching him devolve into a one-note hatemonger. Seeing him finally grow enough to make a good choice would, IMO, be much more satisfying than seeing him just get overpowered by the main team again.  I'm ok with him being a full-on villain, but not if it means he has to get flanderized or can never grow."
shield,3bxwke,Ibclyde,6,Fri Jul 3 05:20:44 2015 UTC,"Personally I think that depends on how well the writers could pull it off if they did. Some of the most satisfying stories see you rooting for someone you once hated. It takes a lot of time and great writing, but it can work. But for season 3, he should remain a villain for sure."

Spike worked because it took several seasons and there was a mystical element -- he wasn't really redeemed until he got his soul back.  Ward is a completely different character -- honestly, he has more in common with Faith. Both had a rough upbringing that left them vulnerable to the influence of an evil mentor. Both, when made desperate by a combination of bad luck and bad choices, chose to keep making worse choices rather than own up to the mistakes they'd already made. Personally, I think her type of redemption -- hitting a breaking point, getting good guidance, and choosing to take responsibility for her crimes -- might work for him.  But even if he's never redeemed, I don't want Ward's portrayal to be devoid of sympathy. I want him to retain the elements of tragedy and pain and devotion and loyalty that make him Ward and not just another mustache-twirler."
shield,3bxwke,Dregride,3,Fri Jul 3 16:58:51 2015 UTC,"I like realistic characters, and in reality the ""right"" person can change anyone.  That's just how humans function, with their plastic brains and innate desire to be loved and contribute cool things to the world (this is evolutionarily programmed, even in lizards).  So just writing Ward off as ""bad"" is overly unrealistic.  I mean most mainstream media is overly unrealistic, but I'd like at least a few shows to exist which I feel reasonably unoffended by. :-)  Though Skye is definitely not one to help Ward.

Don't make heroes look so stupid and unprofessional (Coulson losing his cool over Skye over and over again, May losing her cool over her superior keeping things from her...

shield,3bxwke,Reaility,10,Fri Jul 3 03:37:32 2015 UTC,Deathlock and Mockingbird's costumes just seem to fit in the world. I don't really care too much about comic accuracy. Bonus points if it is accurate but it doesn't need to be.
shield,3bxwke,Xetren,2,Fri Jul 3 04:20:17 2015 UTC,I do feel like they could put more effort into the costumes though. I mean if everyone in the MCU can make a pretty great costume I don't see why AoS can't.

Hell, I don't even think Daredevil managed to pull off a good red suit for Matt and it had a higher budget than AoS.   I personally think the outfits are good enough. Deathlok got a better suit for s2 and Bobbi has a semi-comic accurate look from the comics. Not everything has to be 100% to the comics you know."

The thing about Deathlok was even the concept art for his costume looked better then we got on screen. It was red and looked similar to the comicbook. I think we got the costume we got showed no effort.just some black pants a vest and a blue light. That was disappointing and they had no excuse after showing such good art.

Admittedly, my comics knowledge is spotty, but I don't recall a second Red Skull. And are you talking about Captain America's son w/ Black Widow? His wikia page doesn't mention any of this...   I think Ward might be a HYDRA experiment and not even know it. I think he is psychology program to rebuild HYDRA and just believes he's acting of his own free will it's been mentioned you could be made to comply and not even know it    This I could buy, although I don't think they'll go so far as to say his memories are straight up false (especially since everything we've seen has been consistent with them, re. The Well, etc...).  But Garrett's wilderness survival training seems less like random training and more like a specific program and he definitely used ""real world"" brainwashing techniques to manipulate Ward.

Ward definitely can't have the same backstory -- for one thing, MCU Steve Rogers didn't have a pre-War girlfriend to knock up and, for another, Ward's backstory definitely involved growing up in a family -- Christian remembered him and remembered the same events as him, plus Garrett obviously trained him to be more loyal to himself than to HYDRA (or else Ward would never have suggested leaving HYDRA or betrayed Whitehall to help Skye).  So what the hell do they have in common? Because as far as I can see, not a damn thing.   Ward has a nice face; Red Skull has none. Ward is a good soldier, almost holding his own with May/ Bobbi; Red Skull is a super soldier actually surpassing Captain America. Ward is a complicated, morally gray wildcard -- an anti-villain, known for his mixture of caring motives and ruthless actions.  Red Skull Ultimates is a straightforward, unambiguous monster -- a heinous demon-thing, best known for making Red Wasp kill her husband and then actually killing a fucking baby!

I think it took HYDRA a while but it finally perfected a super soldier Ward. I think Ward without his knowledge has been psychologically groomed to rebuild HYDRA.   In short I think Ward will become Red Skull from the Ultimate universe.

Presumably if Ant Man needs some tech support they could call in Fitz or Simmons to do the work, but odds are anytime Ant Man is around, Tony Stark will be there to fill that role.    Basically, if it's a movie-level bad guy, you're going to get a movie-level super.  Barring Civil War & Infinity wars where it's kind of an all-call anyway."

shield,3boxne,Sempere,19,Wed Jul 1 07:53:55 2015 UTC,"They're separate divisions and he didn't really have much control over what happens over at Marvel TV. That's why SHIELD was so messy for the first half of Season 1 - They got the order for series, then got Winter Soldier's twist dumped in their laps. There's been chatter about it for a while. He views them as the red headed step child piggy backing off their success. If Marvel had had the resources to launch Agents of Shield a little bit after Iron Man/Incredible Hulk... things might be very different in terms of television/film character crossovers."

shield,3boxne,warrenseth,5,Wed Jul 1 13:29:08 2015 UTC,It would actually be great to see Kingpin's interactions with Tony Stark and Cap during Civil War. But I guess that movie will be cluttered as it is so it's not really feasible to waste screen time on those scenes.
shield,3boxne,Matsuyama_Mamajama,3,Wed Jul 1 10:56:36 2015 UTC,I could see that happening more easily than the AoS characrers because Vincent D'Onofrio (Fisk/Kingpin in DD) has been in major films for decades.

Coulso  is totally devoted to being an underground team unknown to the majority of the world. He's not going to publicly reveal himself to the avwngers. Might as well plaster his name around. He's still helped a lot behind the scenes. The defenders just need to actually exist for awhile first. These character get more screen time in one season than some of the movie characters ever get. Why not leave rroom for both
shield,3boxne,francis_who,3,Wed Jul 1 16:57:08 2015 UTC,"While he doesn't need to reveal himself publicly, I think the Avengers should still be aware of his involvement. After all, he's on their side."

What Nick Fury didn't know was that she was the Madame Hydra of that period as Viper had left Hydra by that point.  EDIT: This also has interesting implications for how Agent Carter is going to tie into Agents of SHIELD.  Leviathan was revealed in Secret Warriors and hasn't really had any appearances since, except in Agent Carter."

I watched Iron Man today and the way Ten Rings guy was rubbing his ring reminded me so much of Fennhoff when he was hypnotising people. I think they both had one of the ""ten rings"". They obviously can't develop The Mandarin storyline on AoS or Daredevil or the Iron Man movies. So why not Agent Carter?   Well... the period setting. That's why. But maybe there's a time ring? :P"

They never developed into something that big plotwise."

Kreisberg has been killing it running The Flash, but his recent stay on Green Arrow was unbearable.

I would like to know who the woman is maybe Madme Hydra? I hope we get more members in the show when Zemo appears in Civil war.Ward is Ok but we need more.
shield,3bms17,Demileto,2,Tue Jun 30 15:24:57 2015 UTC,"I don't think we'll be seeing Ward in the comics universe before the show tells his story fully, in much the same vein as Daisy Johnson only  showing up in the SHIELD book after season 2 was over."
shield,3bms17,SwagBelow,1 point,Tue Jun 30 19:52:31 2015 UTC,That if Ward is someone from the comics.  I don't think Ward has a full on origin and hope that he is not Taskmaster he does not fit that character at all but season 3 will have to tell us. I hope it's in the first half of season 3 then the season half. I don't have any hints about his origin do you?
shield,3bms17,Demileto,1 point,Tue Jun 30 20:02:01 2015 UTC,"I don't think Ward fits Taskmaster either. Iin fact I don't see Kevin Feige letting Marvel Television play with Taskmaster at all when the villain could easily be used as a foe against either Captain America or Ant-Man.  No, the character I see Ward resemble the most is Hellfire - both dated Daisy Johnson and betrayed their teams for HYDRA - mixed with a bit of Druid - both were apprentices of John Garrett, though in Druid's case Garrett was a GOOD influence. Hellfire is currently dead in the comics, but given how much Marvel's making the comics resemble the MCU I wouldn't be surprised if they decide to bring the character back and rework JT James as Grant Ward if they show decides to go that way with Ward's character. Regardless, like I said this isn't a story that'll happen before season 3 is over, there are still a lot of questions regarding Ward's family backstory and his motivations and Jed and Maurissa have sort of hinted that those will finally be fully dealt with in a pre-season finale interview:   Let's switch gears to Ward. Will we find out by the end of this season what his ultimate goal is?  JW: I think very quickly it will present itself, what his motives are in this moment. But yes, it turns out that him leaving Kara there, he was not being the best boyfriend in the world -- or maybe he was.  MT: He may still think that he's being the best boyfriend in the world by leaving. So his motives will become more clear by the end of the season, and hopefully they'll become blatantly clear in Season 3."

As a rebellious teen, he accidentally started a fire which burned his house down. He joined the Maggia crime organization. He tried to use his crime connections to help his brother, Simon, save the family business, but got Simon arrested instead. This led to his Simon becoming Wonderman and being sent to fight the Avengers, where he had an attack of conscience and chose to sacrifice himself rather than kill them. Enraged with grief and guilt, Eric blamed the Avengers for his brother's death. Through his crime connections, he got a super scythe weapon and attacked them. When Simon, who was only in a coma, awoke and fought him to protect the Avengers, Eric refused to believe the real Simon would really raise a hand against him and concluded that Wonderman wasn't really his brother but a mutated mockery. From there on, he's dedicated to killing Wonderman so he can salvage what's left of the real Simon and program it onto a zombie that looks like him. Seriously, every synopsis I've read has him trying to kill his brother to save his brother. It's weird."

His major strikes against the team all relied on the element of surprise, on being able to walk among them, manipulate them and then when they least expect he strikes, it's what happened with Victoria Hand, Eric Koenig and Bobbi Morse. Not only he won't be playing the double agent role next season but it'd also be incredibly amateuristic of SHIELD not to be hunting him down as the season premieres after all he did against Bobbi, so by all means May should be with her guard up in case Ward shows up to strike against her and Andrew. And really, when has Ward ever outsmarted or outmatched May? It hasn't happened in two seasons and it'd be incredibly out of character for May to start happening now.  In any case, if any casualty in SHIELD happens I hope to heck that Ward isn't responsible for it, because really, why does it have to be always him? The show created so many great villains last season, yet none of them did anything remotely as memorable as killing Victoria Hand and Eric Koenig or torturing Bobbi Morse, if we're going to have new ones in season 3 I hope they get to be the ones to do the damage against the team, not Ward again."

Then he kidnaps a veterinarian and heads to Portland for the cellist."
shield,3bo9mk,Bookbringer,6,Tue Jun 30 21:04:20 2015 UTC,"Eye for an eye would, by Ward logic, be making May kill Andrew. Or at least think she did."

He doesn't know who the heck Andrew Garner is, let alone Audrey Nathan, Lian May, Fitz's mother or whoever else matters in Simmons', Hunter's or Bobbi's life. If he is to find about Andrew it'll be because he'll be tracking May to kill her, but as far as the others go unless he gets access to SHIELD's files he won't find a single record that'll lead him to any of them. As such, I'm still skeptical about Ward scoring any new kill. And honestly, like I said neither should he, he's scored enough bad things in his villain track record, spread the love a little to the others."
shield,3bo9mk,Demileto,2,Tue Jun 30 22:01:12 2015 UTC,"He kind of does know about the Celllist, Coulson tells him about her in Ep10 when they are in Lola together. Its Ward who tells Garrett about her, and that's why Garrett ensures he releases Daniels in the Fridge raid. He even says thank you to Ward for his tip about the Cellist. But you're right about the Andrew and Lian. Although with regards to Fitzsimmons folks, he'll have a vague knowledge of them from them talking about/to them when they were on the bus together."
shield,3bo9mk,Bookbringer,2,Tue Jun 30 22:33:15 2015 UTC,"Good point about the Cellist, I had forgotten about that. Of course, if I was Coulson I'd have ensured her protection already. As far as Fitzsimmons' folks, vague knowledge isn't enough, we the audience have never met them, it'd come incredibly forced if Ward offs someone and then we find out he/she is a relative of one of them."
shield,3bo9mk,Demileto,2,Tue Jun 30 22:58:29 2015 UTC,"He for sure knows about Audrey -- his information on that matter is the whole reason Garrett released Daniels to distract Coulson.  And I don't think it's unreasonable to assume Ward knows about Fitz's mom or May's ex, given that he spent months on a plane being their friend, and also would have had access to their files (May mentions reading Ward's after they slept together and they had the same rank). Simmons mentions her parents repeatedly in front of him. The fact is, he knows much more about them than they know about him, because he was playing a role the whole time, while they were walking around with their guard down."

He was pretty masterful at deceiving the team during S1, and only broke cover because of Garrett's orders and his crush on Skye. He effectively infiltrated HYDRA to reunite Skye and Cal, and he successfully  deceived Coulson and the team to plant Kara in SHIELD and abduct Bobbi, plus his plan to lure Hunter into a trap. It only backfired because May tricked Kara into wearing her face, just like Garrett would probably have survived if he'd left HYDRA when Ward suggested.  He's had mastermind potential since he showed up."

Most importantly, he can give Ward a psych eval while being held hostage.  I expect Ward will capture loved ones as bait and create Saw-like, Sophie's-choice type scenarios for the team so they can feel his pain (and he can expose them as hypocrites if they choose their loved ones over the greater good).  However, I think Ward's S3 body count will be mostly redshirts. Any important characters he seems to kill will probably turn out to have actually been captured and brainwashed instead.  And if he dies, it will be by his own hand. A deliberate suicide (Redemptive? Despairing? Defiant?) or maybe just getting caught in his own trap. (Someone might help, of course, lock him in or block his escape, but it will primarily be his own fault, IMO.)"
shield,3bo9mk,emma_pops,1 point,Tue Jun 30 22:50:21 2015 UTC,"I agree. I don't ward to be the only baddie at all but he's been the best so far I think. And the way the seasons end so wrapped up , who else can we expect to see?"
shield,3bo9mk,Xetren,1 point,Tue Jun 30 23:41:51 2015 UTC,"We can expect to see the unexpected. Seriously, I spent the midseason break thinking the main focus of 2b would be Cal's band of freaks and their vengeance quest against Coulson/ SHIELD. So wrong. My above guess is based on the obvious interpretation that Ward wants revenge on SHIELD for killing Kara and will spend at least half a season trying to get it.  But, alternatives are possible. Ward might want revenge on HYDRA for brainwashing her more. He might be seeking suicide by cop (or SHIELD agent) or trying to destroy the world. He might spend one episode trying to get revenge on SHIELD, fail miserably, and adopt a new goal of getting powered people by any means. Or he might fall in love with one of his new recruits and forget about revenge once he's moved on."
shield,3bo9mk,echoesintheattic,2,Wed Jul 1 00:43:48 2015 UTC,Yeah I don't expect 23 episodes as ward for our bad guy entree. Maybe 6-8 episodes of ward centric throughout the whole year. Any guesses on who else would be the new/main antagonist for s3?
shield,3bo9mk,Bookbringer,1 point,Wed Jul 1 02:08:21 2015 UTC,"Besides the monolith and the Afterlife Inhumans, who may not have 180ed to support SHIELD just b/c their leader died? Lots of new Inhumans = lots of ""monsters"" of the week, and any powered comics villains just became more plausible. Gorgon, a super-smart member of the Hand, seems to be an important opponent of the Secret Warriors. And I won't completely rule out Whitehall returning as the Kraken.  Anyone Ward recruits may sneak up to take his place (Madam HYDRA/ Viper?), and frankly, Dalton is good enough to pull off a bigger villain role if they can effectively level Ward up from smart, ruthless henchmen to leader of bad, bad men. He may find a way to throw ""monsters of the week"" at them (compete for a higher rank by hurting my enemies?) or morph into someone from the comics himself (Grim Reaper?)"

Peter Parker was married to Mary Jane Parker for twenty years in the comics, but unknown to fans (I think) until Andrew Goletz's Life of Reilly blogged the behind the scenes of the Clone Saga that was a story development imposed by then editor-in-chief Jim Shooter that Marvel's creative staff never quite digested. They tried time and again to revert it in the most aberrant ways, first by revealing the married Peter to be a clone, then by killing Mary Jane and finally by retconning the marriage altogether through a deal with Marvel's de facto devil, Mephisto. A huge chunk of the fanbase, however, is not pleased and scowl at post-One More Day Peter Parker stories to this day, myself included."

Skye's Secret Warriors are going to be a huge part of AoS S3 -- having them accidentally kill a bunch of civilians and themselves would derail AoS's narrative in a big way.  Plus, the catalyst for Civil War will have to be in the movie to make sense to moviegoers who don't watch the show. But if it involves Skye's Secret Warriors in any significant way, it will also have to be in the show to make sense for the viewers who aren't able to see the movie right away.  IMO, AoS will just mention too many new powered people to keep up with, or that some people rejected from the Secret Warriors for being reckless have formed their own hero group called the New Warriors."
shield,3bgwz9,Bookbringer,4,Mon Jun 29 04:32:32 2015 UTC,Very good theory but the show does not set up the films. The films set up the shows.Civil War should have little to no impact on the AoS.

shield,3bgwz9,disneywizard,1 point,Tue Jun 30 10:54:59 2015 UTC,"I think the Registration Act probably was started from (in the movies' universe) when Iron Man first came onto the scene. As we're getting more heroes popping up now, damaging massive cities in battles against alien incursions and now international attacks by an artificial intelligence created by the first modern superhero himself, the government leaders are going to be getting ticked of having to clean up the mess left by these rogue heroes who answer really only to themselves.   My personal theory is that, tying in to Civil War and setting up the Inhumans film in Phase 3, in Season 3 of AOS something is going to release a worldwide Terrigen mist which won't kill the human population but suddenly turn a large portion of the world into Inhumans who are like newly awakened Skye - dangerously uncontrollable.  That will be the tipping point."

I've only done a few issues here and there and it isn't because it isn't entertaining, because I've enjoyed it, it's just in the age of giant crossovers and large stories this gets left in the dust for trying to shoe in characters that don't belong in the 616.  I like these characters and I would love a Shield comic that does something right for them but trying to make a team out of the tv show is desperate and leave much to be desired.    This issue especially was difficult to follow.  I couldn't tell what was 616 and what was MCU anymore as they picked random elements from each.  Trying to label Quake/Daisy as Skye, as if she needed another nickname was horrible.    I do have something nice to say though.  Mr. Hyde's actor, Kyle Mcsomething, was amazing in his performance that I just couldn't help to read Mr. Hyde in this issue as him.

shield,3bdfna,saintratchet,3,Sun Jun 28 14:10:01 2015 UTC,I hate when Marvel makes the comics a reflection of the movies/tv shows. It really annoys me.
shield,3bdfna,UNITBlackArchive,1 point,Sun Jun 28 14:34:11 2015 UTC,"Sadly, this has always been the case.  WAY back in the day, when Lois & Clark was on TV, Perry White stopped saying ""Great Ceaser's Ghost!"" and changed to ""Great Shades of Elvis!"" to match the show.  They threw in Franklin Stern (James Earl Jones) as Perry's boss in the comic too.   Also, Lois calling Clark ""Smallville"" and Supergirl's white t-shirt look came from the animated series, then found their way into the comics.  John Stewart came back prominently in the comics after the JLA cartoon started.    I don't know why they think comic fans can handle multiple alternate universes, but freak out if the comics don't match the shows."
shield,3bdfna,saintratchet,2,Mon Jun 29 19:15:29 2015 UTC,"They don't make the changes for the comic fans. They change things to be more mainstream to attract new readers. If new readers see familiar elements, they can follow the story easier and are more inclined to continue reading.  I get that's why they do things and I understand completely why they do it, I just hate that they do it. It kind of ruins what the loyal fans know.  I got no problem with Marvel introducing Phil Coulson/Cheese/whatever into the comics the same as he is in the movies/tv because he's new. I do have a huge problem with changing Quake, an established character, into some character from the tv show and making her much less appealing to me in my opinion.  Same sort of thing happened to Nick Fury, with his son and that whole weird storyline. Shit just annoys me."
shield,3bdfna,mustachio89,3,Mon Jun 29 19:26:05 2015 UTC,"Calling Daisy ""Skye"" is heavy-handed and a little much. At the very least, they need to have Coulson and Daisy actually spend a bunch more time together and think of a better reason for Coulson to think of the nickname.  However, making Daisy an Inhuman works. The whole thing with Daisy is that the origin of her powers has always been ambiguous. It was believed she was a mutant but unless I'm mistaken it was never totally confirmed. It's the whole reason why making her an Inhuman on the show also worked.   I'm also fine with Hyde becoming more AoS-Cal like. Hyde in the books is a little more one-note while Hyde in the show is a fantastically developed and complex character. It's a step up in this case."

shield,3bdfna,poopeepoo,2,Sun Jun 28 18:14:04 2015 UTC,"IMO this was a really good idea. The show wrote Cal wonderfully, 10x better than the one dimensional comic version. It also made Daisy's power origins make some actual sense... Inhuman heritage (from her mother, who was never discussed in the comics) is a much better explanation than ""my dad ingested so many toxic chemicals that his DNA changed"".   It also gives the Inhumans a prominent member other than Blackbolt and Medusa (and Kamala) and Marvel seems to be pushing the Inhumans so having Daisy on board is a good direction.   The Skye thing is... a bit weird but I guess it's pretty much just a little nod to the show. The explanation was weird though."
shield,3bdfna,jerslan,2,Sun Jun 28 22:48:43 2015 UTC,"They should have done her Inhuman ret-con in her current on-going series. AFAIK, they haven't. They previously established that while she wasn't actually a mutant (in that she didn't possess the X Gene), her ""mutant"" powers were a result of her Dad's scrambled DNA. Her Birth Mother was established as being a Chinese Prostitute that gave her up for adoption before Hyde even knew she was born... and they had met before this issue....  Making Hyde look more like Kyle MacLachlan? Non-issue, they change art and appearances of older characters all the time.  This issue was super, super awkward for many many reasons...."

This retconning to fit whatever marketing campaign is being run for the movies and TV shows - or worse, the scorched-earth approach they're taking towards FF and X-Men just because they don't hold the movie rights, trying to poison the IP and attack its value - just makes me think that Disney is trying to turn Marvel away from comics entirely.  That, of course, would rob all the ingenuity and creativity from the universe, and all the IPs would just be parked in a slowly decaying orbit where they bled off value through movies and TV shows and spinoffs until everyone was just sick of them."

Conspiracy isn't bad, and frankly neither is Encounter at Farpoint.   You're correct that our expectations for genre TV and its standards have changed completely, and that AoS does several things which TNG didn't. But we hold AoS to the current standards, not those from 1987 :) I'd say that the dynamics of what we expect started shifting (genre-wise) with Babylon 5 and DS9, which really focused on arc presentation. AoS s1's arc was pretty weak, frankly - its monster-of-the-week episodes (from the pilot to the Hydra arc) fulfilled their focus of establishing the status quo to be broken and setting up the character relationships, but...we already knew what the status quo was, the character relationships barely change throughout those episodes, and they don't tell particularly interesting stories (again, up 'til the Hydra tie-ins)."
shield,3bcjts,Director_Coulson,3,Sun Jun 28 00:37:44 2015 UTC,"I've made this exact argument with people I know who tried watching AoS at the beginning but gave up on it after a few episodes. I tell them to remember the first season of TNG and parts of the second and think about the humble, sometimes unbearable and often laughable roots that one of the greatest series in the Star Trek franchise grew from. Agents of Shield's earliest episodes were not even close to that and its infancy stages were relatively short-lived. Where Star Trek The Next Generation took two seasons to find its footing, Agents of Shield hit the ground running as soon as the Hydra uprising arc began and if a Marvel fan didn't give the show a chance to that point they missed out on some incredible television viewing."

The situations are a tad different, but the potential is there.   It does sort of feel like the writers on TNG wrote that way in the early seasons because they were finding the show in their inexperience, while AoS was meant to reinvent itself as the MCU settings and circumstances changed around them.  And honestly, AoS has never been ""bad"" to me. There were a few throwaway episodes in the mix, but there always are, and sometimes you have to settle for advancing the greater narrative rather than having a ton of action/drama in every episode of a serial with an overarching tale threaded into the weekly episodes."
shield,3bcjts,Lurkndog,3,Sun Jun 28 00:42:08 2015 UTC,"I agree, S1 of AoS was always pretty good.  After Cap 2 it got much more interesting, but a lot of that was because the characters had been set up well in the previous episodes.  It mattered when characters were revealed to be double agents.  For that matter, I thought Season 2 got off to a slow start, but once again there was a big payoff later on."
shield,3bcjts,TheLantean,3,Sun Jun 28 02:29:20 2015 UTC,"It wasn't just the writers figuring things out, or inexperience, for season three there were significant staff changes such as:    the showrunner (Maurice Hurley) left after the first two seasons and got replaced by Michael Piller who eventually wrote ""The Best of Both Worlds"" Ronald D. Moore (of Deep Space Nine and Battlestar Galactica fame) joined the team plus a bunch of other writers Gene Roddenberry's involvement dropped significantly as the show went on   With this much churn behind the scenes you could almost call it a different show entirely."
shield,3bcjts,Bulby37,2,Sun Jun 28 03:58:48 2015 UTC,"That's a good chunk of info I've never been privy to. With fairness, though, the Borg came about in the second season, which was a great turnaround from having Ferengi as the big bads. Was it a consequence of the changes you mentioned that they altered that particular direction?  The Ferengi weren't totally effective villains at all. They made more sense as the commerce driven race later on, but the first attempts at them were horrible. They felt more like the young step-brother that constantly wants your attention while you're tryin to get bizzy, and his wrath at being ignored is to kick over your Lego town."

As much as I love TNG I can't bring myself to watch the first couple seasons and any episodes involving Q (don't remember when he first appeared). I myself loved the first season yeah it was a little slow at times but it was just getting started. Another one of my favorite shows of all time MASH I wasn't a big fan of the first season. All that said I think there may have been 2 problems. First maybe some people expected a little too much out of a network show. Second (this is my opinion on gamers a lot of the time now myself included) we've become a little too jaded and entitled with what we've come to expect out of the content we consume.

Lack of direction and Roddenberry being too wrapped up in his own Utopian Vision to realize that the writing was horrid and sometimes stupidly racist.  But yeah... Every time someone complains about AoS Season 1 and how the show is doomed because of it?

Also, TNG was able to stay on the air because there was almost no competition and Star Trek fans were so hungry for a new show that they would have watched no matter how bad it was.  Just because people had fewer choices in the past and had to accept bad entertainment doesn't excuse bad shows today.

Even though the universe is expanding, I don't see the New Warriors or anyone being big enough to carry a franchise.   Guardians working was sort of a fluke of great writing, a light hearted atmosphere and a surprisingly good cast. BUT, that was a gamble Marvel had to take, since that film is a huge set up piece for the upcoming Infinity War. They could easily shoehorn all the teams and characters I mentioned into each other on Agents, to start setting up something along the lines of the explosion that sets up the Civil War. The show is big enough now, that they would be foolish to not use it to start setting up the movies.  Build those characters up on AOS, then, start CA:CW with The New Warriors (or whoever, I've always thought that name was silly) hunting down someone with the whole reality show shtick. Movie fans wouldn't need to be invested in AOS, since it's an easy thing to set up, and the more hardcore fans get to see a story they've been watching hit the big screen. Casual fans over hear hardcore fans talking about the tv show, and maybe start watching as well. It can't go wrong.  THEN, when some of those characters are established and start to become popular, is when you give them a movie, or short series on ABC akin to Agent Carter.   I know and enjoy the back story, but if you tried to sell me on a tv show featuring Speedball and Vance Astro I'd laugh at you."
shield,3bawb0,Carlthecool,3,Sat Jun 27 22:55:13 2015 UTC,But a comic series based with Speedball and Vance already exist. It called new warriors and can easily be seen as a television show or film. I mean Phase 4 could potentially have loads of teams of other teams to explore.AoS already has the catapillers so no need shoe them in AoS. I mean AoS can stand on its own now so there is no need for tie in an event like civil war which will be different from the comic.
shield,3bawb0,dasrac,1 point,Sat Jun 27 23:15:43 2015 UTC,"But a comic series based with Speedball and Vance already exist   That has nothing to do with a tv show, that you have to market to the general public. New Warriors is also not a flagship title for Marvel.   I was also saying you could use AOS to build things up for the movies, not that it NEEDED to tie in to the movies. The movies will always take higher precedent than the tv shows, because they will generate higher revenue. TV shows are always going to be hamstrung by advertising being their revenue stream. No matter how successful a series is, it has a top end for revenue.   Thanks for actually reading what I wrote before you responded."
shield,3bawb0,MakesThingsBeautiful,2,Sun Jun 28 02:11:17 2015 UTC,"Given Marvel's history of selling the unsellable you'd still laugh?  I think Speedball and Vance would be awesome (There's real personality to work with, and zero reason for it to be ""gritty"", I'm so sick of gritty, aren't you?)"
shield,3bawb0,dasrac,2,Sat Jun 27 23:45:17 2015 UTC,"I'm definitely sick of gritty. It's why I love the Marvel cinematic and television universe. That being said, we are a niche, in an already niche market. Robbie and Vance and the gang are NOT the kinds of characters that will hold bring in new fans. The New Warriors are overwhelmingly, kind of silly. Even for comic books. That's just an unfortunate side effect of the time frame in which they were conceived.   As a side note, do you think any Disney execs are going to allow a character named Speedball be a primary character, on a show that is going to have at least a little bit of pre-adolescent appeal? AOS is at it's heart a spy show, in the Marvel universe, and has the 9 o'clock slot so it can get away with a teensy bit more, like characters being killed and everything. The New Warriors (or any of the aforementioned teams) if it ever happened would get bumped down to a more PG feel, because Disney would not want to lose out on the toy merchandise.   If it were up to me, Marvel would have 10 hours of weekly television, showcasing all of the great characters they have. Unfortunately, that just isn't feasible, and concessions have to be made. Compacting some of these characters, who are relatively new, and less well known to the public at large, is a thing we, as comic fans will have to learn to accept, and as such, we need to adjust our expectations accordingly.   It would be great to have a New Warriors show, but, there's literally NO reason to expect that to ever happen. Their most important story of the past 10 years, was their involvement in the beginning of The Civil War, and that story, could (and probably will) be told using other characters or events.  I'm just proposing what I see as a reasonable alternative."
shield,3bawb0,MakesThingsBeautiful,2,Sun Jun 28 02:10:45 2015 UTC,"Lolz, the image of a bunch of coked up Disney execs going ""Speedball? You mean one of these?"" as he holds up a baggie, and the poor writer squirming uncomfortably...  Yeah, I see what you mean.  Still, they can tweak (no pun intended) cos from a character perspective they worked real well; Speedball as the odd-ball juvenile, overly straight laced Vance, Firestar, Night-Thrasher, they worked well as an ensemble, and they bounced off each off perfectly.  What I mean is, I was never a big fan off them, but as a kid who discovered comic book shops at about the time they first debuted, I still feel like I know the characters for their personalities first and powers second - exactly the kind of nostalgia that's needed to turn it into a successful TV show (or movie)"
shield,3bawb0,dasrac,2,Sun Jun 28 04:52:27 2015 UTC,"I've been thinking on Hazmat some more. Is that character as interesting if you don't have the interaction with Mettle? They could certainly play up the ""Rogue"" angle and the psychological toll of her not being able to be near anyone, but who would that interplay be on the show?"
shield,3bawb0,admiraltoad,2,Sat Jun 27 15:55:51 2015 UTC,"I was thinking the power base would work well with exploring the fear of this new age of super humans. EVERYONE is scared of radiation. If Simmons comes back, even more paranoid, I think Hazmat would have some good (from a storyline point) interactions with her and Mack, since they are already showing signs of trepidation.  That's why I think Hazmat would be fun for the show. Her villainous potential is just added icing.  *edit - That's not to say they couldn't bring in Mettle as well. He'd be difficult to make look correct in their budget, but, it's becoming a very successful show. I'm sure they could do SOMETHING. Hell, if they give him the Red Skull look, get Chris Evans to do a guest spot and freak the fuck out."
shield,3bawb0,A_Manslayer,3,Sat Jun 27 16:28:45 2015 UTC,"Hellfire and Stonewall seem likely. We've already seen a version of the absorbing man so they can clearly do that power on TV. Hellfire is distinct enough to be interesting. I don't think we will be Phobos because he is just too powerful and it would be a weird thing to get into (we've never talked about Ares in the MCU). I would also don't think we will see Manifold because he has the same powers as Gordon (kind of). Druid would be a bit odd because he is kind of just magic, maybe though."
shield,3bawb0,Bookbringer,3,Sat Jun 27 14:44:20 2015 UTC,"My only thought with Druid is that they'll use him as a bridge to the Doctor Strange movie. Plus, his arc in the comics was great, so here's hoping."
shield,3bawb0,Bookbringer,2,Sat Jun 27 15:09:10 2015 UTC,"His ark was really good, yeah. Wasn't the guy he trained with in the Comics John Garret?  I think about it 50/50 maybe they want introduce magic with Dr. Strange or they want to introduce it beforehand and take that Chance now. Maybe a bit more towards introducing it now, since they hinted at some mystic things and the Hand in daredevil."

Switches to team good guy or whatever."

But, that means I get to go into this new season blind and won't be disappointed by differences between the comics and their television counterpart."
shield,3bawb0,iron_sites,2,Sat Jun 27 15:28:16 2015 UTC,"Continuity can be a burden, for sure. However, I will say that they have done a good job veering from the comics when it makes sense, yet also picking up some cool comics moments when it made sense (like the infiltration of Hydra, for example).   This has been true for me with Walking Dead as well. I've found that knowing the comics has enhanced both the comics and the television show for me. I get excited when I see familiar characters or storylines introduced, but it is also exciting to see how they venture from the source material in interesting ways."

shield,3bac4q,Lampmonster1,5,Sat Jun 27 17:51:48 2015 UTC,I'd love it to be true too but I don't think the time line lines up. Matt should be a lot older that Skye. At least 7-8 years taking law school and everything Matt has had to accomplish to get where he was by Daredevil Season 1.

It's true that AOSP is open-source, but AOSP is only updated once in a blue moon and it's anyway useless without all the things Google added.   I'm not an idiot, I consider myself pretty well-informed when it comes to phones. In the last few years, I've owned a lot of Android flagships - every high-end HTC from the Desire HD to the M7, I've rooted and flashed phones too. I've also used an iPhone before getting my 1520. So please, spare me the fucking superiority complex. I am informed, and the Lumia is probably the best phone I've ever owned.  I use an old Z1 because I don't have a choice. I'm not about to buy an Android flagship just to use for a few months until O get a new Lumia. There are no good ones on the market either. The M9 is an M8 rehash, and the Samsung and LG are made of he cheapest plastic they could find.  The only true choices are a Lumia, a Nexus or an iPhone. The iPhone is crazy expensive and not worth it, and I don't like Android. I think I made a good choice. It's also not like Android needs any free publicity given how popular it is."

Material Design really changed a lot of UI related issues, which seems to have been your main concern.  Why do you believe that a Nexus is the only true choice? If you know how to flash, any other flagship can run something AOSP-based. Of course, there's the argument that xposed plus the stock rom is more stable. Personally, I use a Nexus just because I like to be on the bleeding edge and run things that are fresh developed. Just in case you're going to explode again, I'm just curious and mean no harm."

Ever since then I've been all over Marvel comics and been trying to catch up with what's happening in Secret Wars this year.   Anyway, to answer your question, the Hydra plotline is actually a part of Secret Warriors so there aren't any other individual comics that I'm aware of that deal with it.

shield,3b7w44,Morrice94,15,Fri Jun 26 18:33:19 2015 UTC,TL;DR Secret Warriors for non comic readers?
shield,3b7w44,TheHandyman1,31,Fri Jun 26 18:40:55 2015 UTC,"Previously, Nick Fury conducts a coup on Latveria that is meant to be secret. It gets out and he goes into hiding leaving Maria Hill in charge. Fast forward through Civil War to Secret Invasion when the Skrulls attack, Nick Fury and his Caterpillar team (The superpowered individuals he has brought together) help fight them off. Norman Osborne helps to fight off the Skrulls and takes over SHIELD and he turns it into HAMMER. Nick Fury now can't work for SHIELD and so uses this Caterpillar team and two others known as the Secret Warriors to help take down Hydra after discovering they'd been in SHIELD/manipulating them all along.  As you might have guessed, the MCU has already taken cues from this with Cap 2 revealing HYDRA to be controlling SHIELD and so the show will probably have Skye leading a team of powered people on missions. The comic series was written by Jonathan Hickman and has seeds for his other series that follow, and things like the Great Wheel might be difficult to do as Whitehall and Strucker"
shield,3b7w44,Gremzero,6,Fri Jun 26 18:48:50 2015 UTC,Would be kinda of cool if they brought Norman Osborne in through the show instead of waiting until Civil War or Spiderman

shield,3b7xlt,-MS-94-,42,Fri Jun 26 18:14:23 2015 UTC,I hope we see some actual Secret Warriors and not just Quake and a bunch of analogues.
shield,3b7xlt,nurdboy42,20,Fri Jun 26 18:28:11 2015 UTC,They already started with the analogues. Lincoln is probably suppose to be a new version of Hellfire since they can't use really use magic.
shield,3b7xlt,SwagBelow,25,Fri Jun 26 18:38:19 2015 UTC,"It's not simply a case of ""can't use magic"", Hellfire's powers come from the Phantom Rider, a character that isn't established in the MCU, would they waste a lot of time to create a mythology for the sake of one character? Of course not, it's simpler to retcon him as an Inhuman. A similar reason can be applied to almost all the other Secret Warriors; Phobos, for example, can't be the son of Ares because, well, while Asgardians exist Olympians don't."
shield,3b7xlt,Demileto,10,Fri Jun 26 19:03:09 2015 UTC,I think Olympians exist they just have yet to introduce them perhaps til Thor Ragnarok  but I do see your point but I want logical explanations if they go the Inhuman route.
shield,3b7xlt,SwagBelow,13,Fri Jun 26 19:09:50 2015 UTC,"I could definitely see Olympians being another special kind of alien in the same vein as Asgardians, but like I said that'd require a big arc to develop them and I'm not sure the show'd do that when it'd be easier to retcon Phobos as an Inhuman."
shield,3b7xlt,Demileto,5,Fri Jun 26 19:21:55 2015 UTC,That is true it would just be easier to retcon him as an inhuman.
shield,3b7xlt,SwagBelow,7,Fri Jun 26 19:36:42 2015 UTC,"I really don't think that arc would necessarily have to be done before he is introduced if they do use him on the show. It could be something that they touch upon initially and then becomes something that they start building after, which could open a lot of story options too.  Basically they just need to do something initially when he is introduced like:  Coulson: This is Phobos. He's kind of the son of Ares.  Skye: Ares?  Coulson: Yeah, Ares. God of War. Son of Zeus.  Skye: Wait, you mean the Greek god Ares? The Greek Gods actually exist?  Coulson: Why wouldn't they? The Norse Gods exist. I'm friends with one them.  Skye: I guess that's a fair point.  It would a quick set up that would get viewers to easily understand his origin and also leave any additional building for future stories. We're already familiar with a similar thing with the Asgardians and the Greek Gods are already something people know, so it's not like he's the son of a character people are completely unfamiliar with with (even if they are so far unfamiliar with these versions of Greek gods)."
shield,3b7xlt,Fett02,12,Fri Jun 26 20:20:39 2015 UTC,"They already had this conversation in the first season.    Skye: You guys may think it's old news, but it's new... news to everybody else. So, Asgardians are aliens from another planet that visited us thousands years ago?  Phil Coulson: Or more.  Skye: And because we couldn't understand aliens, we thought they were gods?  Phil Coulson: That's where our Norse mythology comes from. Skye: That's too crazy. Do you think other deities are aliens, too? Vishnu for sure, right?   But it was a throwaway line. Asgardians is one thing, but Olympians is an entirely separate mythology. Just because one exists doesn't make another existing any more reasonable."
shield,3b7xlt,Mullet_Ben,5,Fri Jun 26 20:45:42 2015 UTC,Why would it be completely unreasonable within the context of the universe that's already been established for the Greek gods not to exist?
shield,3b7xlt,Fett02,3,Fri Jun 26 21:13:07 2015 UTC,"One existing does not necessarily mean that the other does too, it's something that they'd have to build up."
shield,3b7xlt,Demileto,2,Fri Jun 26 21:17:30 2015 UTC,"Oh, you meant within both my dumb dialogue and that from the show as why it would be not be logical for Greek gods to exist just because Norse gods do. Sorry."
shield,3b7xlt,Fett02,7,Fri Jun 26 21:24:25 2015 UTC,No that is sloppy bad writing. Olympians should be introduced in the films and not be a conversation piece to make jokes they are important.Hercules and Ares were Avengers and should be properly introduced in the Thor films.
shield,3b7xlt,SwagBelow,4,Fri Jun 26 20:48:46 2015 UTC,"I was going to say that I didn't think Olympians had enough density to merit a movie, but your idea of doing so in a Thor film is actually reasonable, I like it."
shield,3b7xlt,Demileto,4,Fri Jun 26 20:57:59 2015 UTC,Thanks I like the Olympians but I think they are to similar to Thor to merit there own films. I feel like that Olympus can be one of the 9 realms because we have yet to properly expolre them in the MCU. I hope Thor Ragnarok shows us the nine realms. Show that  Olympians and Asgardians are friends and rivals and Hercules and Ares are supporting Characters in the film.
shield,3b7xlt,SwagBelow,2,Fri Jun 26 21:08:28 2015 UTC,"I'm not a screenwriter and just thought of a possible exchange in the course of 10 seconds, but I didn't mean that would be something word for word, just something quick to get my point that it wouldn't be hard or impossible to introduce him as a Greek god.  Viewers are already familiar with the concept of Greek gods and the concept of ancient gods being an existing thing, so if they had some sort of episode where they built a Secret Wars team where we met Character X who is an Inhuman and Character Y who has some scientific thing done to them, it wouldn't be impossible or unreasonable to meet Phobos who is said to be the son of a Greek god.  I also didn't mean the Greek gods couldn't be important or have a big arc after his introduction or later used in movies, something they've already done with the Inhumans, if used within the show.   They could introduce Phobos, say he is a Greek god (which we could believe because he has powers and it's not impossible to be true for this universe), expand on it later in a bigger arc like they did with the Inhumans, and utilize it in a move like Thor where they save the bigger characters."
shield,3b7xlt,Fett02,2,Fri Jun 26 21:09:53 2015 UTC,It is a completely different concept though.The MCU has yet to even hint at the existence and would not make sense and open the door to other questions. Shield just does not recruit a Greek God to a team that makes no sense. The concept has to much mythology about it and is not the same as the inhumas. The film Inhumans is going to focus on the the royal family and other famous Inhumans. AoS is just using minor ones or making it up so it does not matter in the long run what AoS does with those Inhumans. Phobos is Ares's son a prominent character and they would have to answer questions like how did Coulson recruit a Greek God without any context.You see it  makes no sense.Olympians should be properly introduced in a film like Thor and have people understand where they come from. They should just make him a fish oil Inhuman.
shield,3b7xlt,SwagBelow,2,Fri Jun 26 21:31:22 2015 UTC,"The problem here is that Olympians can't be shoehorned like that, they have to be introduced and developed first before Phobos as the son of a Greek god can remotely work on screen.   The big problem Marvel had when making the first Thor was how to make ancient gods work in the modern world; it's the reason they were remade into aliens, and a good chunk of Thor's Earthly scenes are devoted to make a case of them being real while removing the obvious religious conotations that such a notion would bring. Given how much work Marvel had to do to have Thor feel like a real character in the minds of the audience I can't see them doing an offhand introduction to Olympians just to rush Phobos into the story."
shield,3b7xlt,Demileto,1 point,Fri Jun 26 21:33:20 2015 UTC,Also I don't know whether they can use Hellfire considering the Hydra stuff.
shield,3b7xlt,Sibbo94,2,Fri Jun 26 18:43:31 2015 UTC,They will probably change it to rising tide or Leviathan from Agent Carter.
shield,3b7xlt,SwagBelow,1 point,Fri Jun 26 18:46:27 2015 UTC,Probably not Rising Tide and perhaps Leviathan could still be a HYDRA splinter group even though it's linked to the Soviets in the MCU
shield,3b7xlt,Sibbo94,7,Fri Jun 26 18:51:39 2015 UTC,"I hope they keep  leviathan separate from hydra in the comics there was a three way war between Hydra, shield, and leviathan. I hope to see that play out on screen."
shield,3b7xlt,SwagBelow,2,Fri Jun 26 18:57:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah, hopefully."
shield,3b7xlt,Bookbringer,15,Fri Jun 26 18:29:24 2015 UTC,"So it's definite! We all suspected it, but now it's for sure -- a major arc will be the formation and leading of a Secret Warrior team.  I'm kinda psyched for this.  I wonder which characters will be the inspiration for new characters and how they'll be different.  Characters I want to see: someone who fills J.T James/ Hellfire's shoes --maybe Lincoln?  I wouldn't mind seeing the Johnny Horton's daughter, since Garrett mentioned him, although I hope she gets a better name than Yo-Yo. I really would like to see Alex Aaron/ Phobos, the little kid who can induce fear.  In fact, I'd like to see Alex start out as one of Ward's recruits andnget rescued or given up.  Seriously, this next season could be cool. Except, I'm worried how the hell they're going to do justice to all these new characters, plus main characters."
shield,3b7xlt,SwagBelow,10,Fri Jun 26 18:44:33 2015 UTC,I see the new recruits having individual episodes in season 3 but becoming put pretty much extras learning to use there powers. I don't  think Phobos will be introduced because they have yet to introduce Olympians in the MCU. So they might wait til Thor Ragnarok to do so.
shield,3b7xlt,Bookbringer,4,Fri Jun 26 19:04:12 2015 UTC,"Are there even plans to introduce the Olympians in Thor: Ragnarok? If not, it's not impossible they could wind up in AoS, or just being ignored.  They could retcon Phobos' origin into a fish oil Inhuman or leave it mysterious --say he's had powers for as long as he can remember and leave it at that, for now."
shield,3b7xlt,Demileto,3,Sat Jun 27 00:03:00 2015 UTC,"I'll probably bring a big polemic to this thread by saying this, but really, I'd be utterly shocked if Hellfire doesn't turn out to be Grant Ward himself. When you read the backstories of the original Secret Warriors from the comics you can pretty much spot that Ward borrows several elements not just from J. T. James, like being a former love interest for Daisy Johnson and turning traitor for HYDRA, but also, surprising enough, Sebastian Druid, and a big one at that: being an apprentice of John Garrett.   Hellfire's Profile  Druid's Profile  So yeah, I'm kind of expecting season 3 to be the turn of an anti-villain into an anti-hero.  As far as Phobos is concerned, the only thing I ask of the character is that they don't make him a 10 year old, that may work in the comics but it'd rub me the wrong way watching the show putting a child against the dangers SHIELD usually faces."
shield,3b7xlt,Bookbringer,2,Fri Jun 26 19:12:01 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure I understand your argument. JT/ Hellfire's arc is basically that he joins Secret Avengers/ SHIELD in sincerity, but comes to detest Fury and doubt their ability to make a difference. When HYDRA corners him, he agrees to turn traitor in exchange for his safety and Daisy's, whom he's dating. Fury finds out and kills him. While I acknowledge Ward's story has some tiny parallels -- he is romantically interested in Skye and he worked for HYDRA while in SHIELD -- I don't see what could possibly happen in S3 to make him fill that role now.   What are you expecting and how could any JT resemblance redeem Ward into anti-hero status?  Druid's connection to Garrett is interesting, but in the comics, Garrett never betrays SHIELD for HYDRA. And apart from Garrett training him, I don't see anything in common with Ward.  Regarding Phobos -- They'd probably up him to young teens if they do include him. Though, they may just replace him with a similarly powered character like Terrence Ward, or a composite."
shield,3b7xlt,Demileto,4,Sat Jun 27 00:32:30 2015 UTC,"If Marvel's Cinematic Universe mirrored the comics 1:1 neither Sitwell, Garrett or Pierce would've been HYDRA traitors. I see Grant being the show's version of Hellfire because I'm not expecting them to give Hellfire the exact same story; they didn't do that, after all, with Daisy. In fact, I'd even go so far as to say a JT James story true to the source is already prejudiced, because everyone would see it as a rehash of Grant Ward."
shield,3b7xlt,Bookbringer,2,Sat Jun 27 01:24:50 2015 UTC,"Right, I get that, but how could Ward fill JT/ Hellfire's role in S3? Can you give me an example of what you think could happen? How can Ward betray the Secret Warriors when no one in SHIELD will give him a snowball's chance in hell? And how would it redeem him/ bring him from anti-villain to anti-hero? What, exactly, are you suggesting might happen?  Cuz there's not much else to Hellfire's character or storyline.  For example, if Lincoln filled the role, what could happen is, he could join Skye's team but constantly clash with SHIELD protocols and Coulson and in general have a problem with the whole thing, but stick it out for her. Then he could get cornered by HYDRA (let's say Ward) who promises not to hurt Skye (or to give him something he needs to save Skye, etc...) if he does them a favor.  Or, in keeping with your Lincoln is Thomas theory, Lincoln could join, clash, etc... Then betray the SW for the brother he loves instead of the woman he loves.  Besides, Lincoln's powers are already known to cause fire, and we've seen him use a metal pipe to condcut his power -- which was pretty close to JT's MO in the comics."
shield,3b7xlt,Demileto,3,Sat Jun 27 01:40:02 2015 UTC,"I do think Lincoln's story in season 3A will mirror a lot Ward's in season 1, down to regarding Fitz like a brother and betraying the team in the long run, but I don't see it having nearly the same consequences as Ward's or JT's betrayals did (that is, no deaths will come out of it) nor that it'll be due to stupid protocols - he'll be doing it because while his relationship with Grant may be broken he's still his brother and he doesn't want SHIELD to kill him.  In truth, when I say that Grant's the one more likely to be Hellfire what I mean is that I see his arc this season leading him to undergo Terrigenesis in a desperate attempt to get the means to protect the people he loves, especially Thomas, because his Specialist skills will continuosly be proven to be insufficient against the threats they'll be facing in season 3B, and the power he'll get will especifically be the manipulation of fire, thus Hellfire. This is also why I constantly think Christian will be season 3B villain, no other enemy could rile Grant up as much as his older brother for him to obsess so much with the protection of his loved ones."
shield,3b7xlt,Mycareer,12,Sat Jun 27 02:23:15 2015 UTC,"Ooo, and if Ward restarts Hydra, he and Skye could be at each others throats all season. I'm ok with that!"

Edit: fixed up the spoiler thing ~~damn you being on a phone ~~"
shield,3bac4z,k1rra,7,Sat Jun 27 08:49:56 2015 UTC,It doesn't only react to inhumans though. The times we see it react are before Gordon is about to teleport into a room. My major theory is it reacts to either his quantum entanglement bridge (they made a big fuss about explaining what it was) or that it reacts when it senses danger. The reason I say this is because there is a scene where Gordon and Lincoln are stood in front of it talking about the rock for a good few minutes in the finale and it doesn't react despite their Inhuman presence.

shield,3b9mpf,SwagBelow,1 point,Sun Jun 28 19:19:05 2015 UTC,Magic wont affect the MCU in a big way either. They already introduced magic in Age of Ultron. so they have another person that can use magic? It's a secret team. It won't affect the MCU any more than the Inhumans did.In fact I'd say that terrigen fish oil will have a much bigger impact than one person with magic.
shield,3b9mpf,Xetren,3,Sun Jun 28 22:53:21 2015 UTC,If you are talking about Scarlet Witch they explained what she does is not magic but mental abilities. She will probably train to develop magic but it is not that. AoS would have to build up the mythology of magaic in the same way as inhumans and it makes no sense to do it til Doctor Strange and the Fish oil thing only affects AoS not the entire MCU so that is why it's  OK.
shield,3b9mpf,SwagBelow,1 point,Mon Jun 29 01:12:41 2015 UTC,"All magic in the MCU is protrayed more as ""science we don't yet understand"" more than true supernatural magic.

I never expected that."
shield,3b9mpf,Regard87,-1,Mon Jun 29 15:10:36 2015 UTC,But the Kree reference was a dead corpse and they did not confirmed it til Season 2 and had no effect in the MCU. Magic and the Greek Pantheon are more complicated are characters that have a lot of mythology to them. I rather AoS focus on the Fish oil thing and let the movies handle all that.

Can you link me to where they confirmed it wasn't magic? She got her abilities from an infinity stone correct? Infinity stones are magical right? I'm almost 100% certain magic already exists to some degree in the MCU.  Also, I think it's pretty safe to say that's not mental abilities. I'm sure her powers fall beyond that category."
shield,3b9mpf,Xetren,1 point,Mon Jun 29 01:19:15 2015 UTC,These are the AOS inhumans though. The movie is going to be about the royal family.So AoS introducing Inhumans is Ok and they can do what they want. I am also sure Magic exists already but AoS will not be the one to introduce it to the show. They are not going to spend a bunch of episodes building that Mythology of magic when they can use the fish oil bomb.They also did not use the words Magic to describe her powers. They made sure to keep it scientific.til they use the words magic her powers are science based.
shield,3b9mpf,SwagBelow,0,Mon Jun 29 01:36:06 2015 UTC,"So you have no where to base your ""science base""? You literally have zero point here. your just stating your opinion with nothing to back it up. I'm sure they could introduce some minor magic into AoS. Just as they introduced minor inhuman stuff in AoS.  I'll ask again. did they confirm that Scarlet's powers are science based? because no scientific shit does the stuff she does. You can't just ignore that her powers come from magic in the comics.   Kinda feels like your just in denial here. I don't see why they couldn't introduce minor magic into AoS if they can introduce Inhumans (which is a pretty huge thing actually). I don't think it's wise to say a for sure ""no"" you say they aren't going to do it like you are the writer or something, the more accurate thing to say would be ""I don't think they will"".  There's MINOR magic they can introduce. nothing major. They can do the same thing they did with Inhumans. MINOR things. the Inhuman Introduction was MINOR, nothing that will likely affect the movies (although it will be fun to see how they avoid EVER mentioning the Terrigen Fish Oil bomb in the movies, seems like a pretty big event.). I'm saying they can introduce minor magic that won't affect the movies.  The same could be said about your assumption that Scarlet's powers are science based. where did they say it was strictly science? Her powers came from the MIND GEM, which is MAGIC.  Any who, there's my great wall o' text. Feel free to correct me on anything I'm wrong about.  EDIT: I apologize if i have been a bit repetitive here."

shield,3b6cdg,plymouthpower,2,Sun Jun 28 04:36:11 2015 UTC,I know right. I remember watching it unfold and just feeling the way my four year old would feel if I told her Santa wasn't real.
shield,3b6cdg,Scorpion197,1 point,Sun Jun 28 07:05:25 2015 UTC,"I agree, almost wish that I didn't see that last minute or so. It's been tooling around in my mind for some time. I don't know if that 0-8-4 exists in the comics at all, but I'm overexcited to see a solution."

shield,3b8vwx,mrmazzz,7,Fri Jun 26 22:37:37 2015 UTC,Its hard to answer this. Every episode has critical plots mover forward that affect the latter half of the season.

shield,3b8vwx,sgeswein,4,Sat Jun 27 01:05:08 2015 UTC,It won't really work. There aren't any episodes without either critical story moves or fun material. Really you should just watch it over time
shield,3b8vwx,Try_Another_Please,1 point,Sat Jun 27 02:24:05 2015 UTC,"All progress the plot. Who you really are, One of Us, and Melinda are all pretty standalone, so their main plot elements can be be caught up on the previously-on-Agents-of-Shield commercials, but they're pretty enjoyable and have some good character work.  For sheer enjoyment, Frenemies and Dirty Half Dozen were so fun."
shield,3b8vwx,Bookbringer,1 point,Sat Jun 27 01:57:33 2015 UTC,Even the episodes that are not key to the plot still add a lot of backstory to the characters. I would not miss any of them.
shield,3b8agf,DeathFeind,6,Fri Jun 26 19:47:33 2015 UTC,They will retcon all the histories of the Secret Warriors to fit the show. So they will all be fish oil inhumans.
shield,3b8agf,SwagBelow,3,Fri Jun 26 20:02:19 2015 UTC,"I'm not so sure of that.    One of the Secret Warriors is the son of Carl Creel (The Absorbing Man, the powered villain in S201 and S202 who was after the Obelisk for Hydra).  He hasn't been confirmed an Inhuman (and Marvel has said not all super heroes are Inhuman), so it's not a stretch that they could introduce the son of Creel as a Secret Warrior."
shield,3b8agf,RoyAwesome,3,Sat Jun 27 02:39:35 2015 UTC,Maybe but I feel AoS did the fish oil thing so it could be an Inhuman origin. So I feel like the team will be simialr to licoln which is a bunch of made up charcters but we will see.
shield,3b8agf,SwagBelow,2,Sat Jun 27 03:28:17 2015 UTC,"right now the secret warriors team on Shield is looking like Skye, Lincoln and Deathlock"
shield,3b8agf,brazil201,3,Fri Jun 26 20:30:43 2015 UTC,Secret Warriors was about 3 different teams.  I can see Deathlok heading up another one of the teams.  Puts him in a recurring character role rather than a series regular.    I can see Lincoln taking Hellfire's spot though.
shield,3b8agf,RoyAwesome,1 point,Sat Jun 27 02:41:36 2015 UTC,"Deathlok probably won't be on the main team, since we haven't heard word of J.August coming back as a regular/ semi-regular.  Lincoln probably will, but he might initially focus on helping the Afterlife community get resettled. Being against Jiaying's war doesn't mean he's pro- SHIELD all of a sudden."
shield,3b8agf,Bookbringer,2,Fri Jun 26 23:42:41 2015 UTC,"Skye has some overlaps with Daisy Johnson's comic story, but also a ton of differences, the most important of which is that she is Inhuman and her powers derive from her mother's side. Most likely any new powered people she recruits will be latent Inhumans like herself who are activated by the fish oil, although some Dethlok-style enhanced people might show up too. The movie tie-ins will remain minimal. If AoS is doing Secret Warriors, Civil War will not. At most, they might alude to secret backup handling a small problem."
shield,3b8agf,Bookbringer,1 point,Fri Jun 26 22:35:43 2015 UTC,"Knowing that Skye aka Daisy Johnson soon to be Quake has almost the same story as the comic, especially involving her father, Cal.   Not even remotely the case. The recent SHEILD #7 did some really awkward retconning.... but other than that? Her origins, how she joined SHIELD, etc... Almost totally different."
shield,3b8agf,jerslan,-2,Fri Jun 26 21:16:04 2015 UTC,"Calvin Zabo is retconning?.... i said almost as in not exact. Daisy was an orphan, later become a shield agent under nick fury which in AoS was replaced by coulson. Daisy was born with her powers due to calvins mutation. Jiaying did not exist, she was a whore named kim johnson. That is what i meant by almost."
shield,3b8agf,jerslan,3,Fri Jun 26 21:25:38 2015 UTC,"No, he was always her father... But originally he didn't even know she had been born until later and her mother was a Chinese Prostitute who gave her up for adoption.  The name ""Daisy Johnson"" was from Daisy's Adoptive Family. Skye was never adopted and was given the name ""Mary Sue Poots"" by one of her orphanages.  Daisy was recruited into SHIELD in High School when her pseudo-mutant powers (from the scrambled genes she got from her Dad) kicked in. Her powers being Inhuman in origin is yet another retcon.   Skye was recruited as a hacker in her 20s, then got powers when she accidentally underwent Terrigenesis.  Daisy has known about her father for some time, and IIRC they had met at least once before.   Daisy just got the nickname ""Skye"" in SHIELD #7 when Coulson calls her that and her Dad asks about it (A nick-name since Daisy's been spending a lot of time in Space with the Winter Soldier). Honestly would have been better without that. It was like they were trying too hard to tie to the MCU (because having Coulson, May (who was absent this one), Fitz, and Simmons wasn't enough apparently).  Note: When I say Daisy, I'm referring to Earth-616 Quake and when I say Skye, I'm referring to MCU Quake.  They've been doing a LOT of retcons lately and I really wish they would stop. It's OK for there to be differences between the comics and the MCU. That makes both more interesting and unique, instead of the same old thing rehashed the same old way."
shield,3b8agf,DBHT14,2,Fri Jun 26 22:47:22 2015 UTC,"Hey I think adding in Skye works! In that it is super confucisng and weird now, and the new Winter Soldier run is too.  Seriously half the time Im not sure if its a comic or the deranged rambling of an attempted Grateful Dead movie."
shield,3b8agf,ralphuniverse,-1,Fri Jun 26 23:12:45 2015 UTC,This is the perfect opportunity to introduce the Olympians by way of Phobos. I doubt  a 10 year old Phobos would work on the show but an older teenager probably would. There would be no need to introduce the Olympian Royals unless they wanted too. But to have a fellow with unexplained powers who gradually learns he is the son of Ares would be good.

shield,3b3f24,eragonisdragon,12,Thu Jun 25 18:21:32 2015 UTC,"Given how tight lipped Marvel is id be stunned if he gave anything concrete.  It is however a good interview,Clark knows his comics and his theory is a good one,the set up screams Secret Warriors."
shield,3b3f24,Scorpion197,11,Thu Jun 25 22:03:32 2015 UTC,"Yeah I'd be shocked if it wasn't the secret warriors at this point.

shield,3b3f24,Gremzero,3,Thu Jun 25 22:17:20 2015 UTC,"The promo image of sky with the tagline ""can you keep a secret"" is a pretty good indication that they are going to be doing Secret Warriors, or Secret Wars."

shield,3b5ld3,Capt_SteveRogers,8,Fri Jun 26 03:56:24 2015 UTC,"Both have pluses and minuses. There's some good elements of S1 I really miss -- the humor, as you noted, and the interpersonal relationships seemed more organic. However, S2 managed to get rid of a lot of the little cheesiness that hampered S1, and it introduced a lot of awesome new characters, and seriously stepped up the fight scenes.  Regarding Ward -- I don't think it was a mess up to have him turn to HYDRA. He stated and proved repeatedly in S2 that he was never really loyal to them. He's going back to them now, not because he's become a true believer in the HYDRA cause, but because it's full of resources he can use to fuel his vengeance quest against SHIELD (presumably). Plus, loyal or not, HYDRA was his home for 10 years, and he may crave the comfort of familiarity right now."
shield,3b5ld3,Bookbringer,3,Fri Jun 26 06:54:55 2015 UTC,"I totally agree, I thought it was just me who felt this way.  I miss the humour too, and the relationships (they were so fractured and distant to each other in S2, Skimmons used to be so close, yet they barely had any screen time together in S2, or it was all full of angst in their scenes, same as Fitzsimmons). I just liked how fun the show used to be, instead of worrying every week heh."
shield,3b5ld3,dreamycreamy93,2,Fri Jun 26 09:19:39 2015 UTC,"I don't think it messed up his character. I think being unpredictable is part of his character.  I liked both seasons, but for different reasons. Season one was great for the humor and team bonding. Season two had great action and stuff, plus it had that great father daughter relationship between Skye and Coulson (loved the occasional hugs).   But I do miss the humor of season one."
shield,3b5ld3,Xetren,1 point,Fri Jun 26 16:40:21 2015 UTC,I'm rewatching it on Netflix now. Skye just got shot and Garrett just boarded the Bus(code name Shield 616 btw)   Season 1 is great. Very intense.
shield,3b5ld3,BiggChicken,1 point,Mon Jun 29 19:40:20 2015 UTC,Season 1 was way better in opinion.The Winter Solider tie in completely destroyed the foundation of the show and did something that would have never been done in a first season of any other show. I actually think AoS will not get better then it's first season because of what happened. They did something truly special with that tie in.Season 2 was Ok and passable but had problems like that  real shield nonsense and other pacing and character issues .  I  feel  season 1 will be the best AoS has ever been and will be. I hope season 3 proves me wrong.
shield,3b7b9q,Big-turd-blossom,21,Fri Jun 26 15:32:41 2015 UTC,And let the flame war commence!  But really what is the point of this post? To start a war? Jiaying 2.0?  I like all three of them.  EDIT: I stand corrected. No flames have emerged. (I think I'm just used to seeing DC vs. MCU flame wars on YouTube.)
shield,3b7b9q,Xetren,3,Fri Jun 26 16:31:20 2015 UTC,What's a flame war? It sounds fun but the context your using it means it obviously isn't?
shield,3b7b9q,emma_pops,2,Fri Jun 26 23:49:53 2015 UTC,Basically a big fanboy war. where people argue about there opinions and such.

shield,3b7b9q,zgung,3,Fri Jun 26 16:34:13 2015 UTC,That's exactly my point. They can do so much better but their casting and writing letting them down.
shield,3b7b9q,dublued,7,Fri Jun 26 18:56:33 2015 UTC,"I fear if an MCU show was on the CW, it would be very similar to Arrow and Flash.  The problem is the network. They consistently make shows like this because to cater to a key demographic.  Gotham, which is on Fox, is pretty excellent."

shield,3b7b9q,emma_pops,-1,Fri Jun 26 17:48:38 2015 UTC,"But it's bad in a funny/fun way. The sheer stupidity of some of the stuff is hilarious. My favorite scene is when Nygma just randomly becomes crazy and starts talking to himself for no reason. It's like the writers just went, ""oh crap, we didn't do much with the character this whole season, let's just make him act like a stereotypical crazy person to remind the audience that he's going to become the Riddler."" And casting Conan O'Brien Jr. to play little Joker (maybe) was pretty funny too."
shield,3b7b9q,Smooth_Meister,3,Fri Jun 26 21:20:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah I struggle with the dc stuff too for similar reasons. Flash is sometimes so cheesy it hurts my teeth and arrow just felt very meandering and without purpose, especially in S3. Also I was thinking about it the other day, with the superheroes on the DC shows everything is earthbound. Whereas AoS a large amount of the powers that encounter are alien. And as I'm a Sci Fi girl at heart I think that's why I prefer the Marvel stuff.   Edit: I also like the first part of Shield S1 though so what do I know? Lol"

I also don't know about the while Fitz/Simmons, Caitlin/Cisco comparison, because there was no pining between the 2 in the flash."
shield,3b7b9q,bkishaan,3,Fri Jun 26 16:56:51 2015 UTC,"I didn't mean the romance, I always see Fitz/Simmons as a single entity working together (excluding the love)."
shield,3b7b9q,Luminaire,1 point,Fri Jun 26 18:45:51 2015 UTC,"I don't think Cisco and Caitlyn were like fitz/simmons too much.  For one they were actually more seperate characters than fitz and simmons.  They had different motivations and different personalities, for example Cisco jokes a lot more and Caitlyn is more uptight whereas at first fitz and simmons could be used almost interchangably.  Also they are gong to become killer frost and vibe whereas fitz and simmons were original unpowered characters (although we don't know what will happen to simmons in season 3).  Really the main similarity is that they are both pairs of scientists"
shield,3b7b9q,StepNGo,1 point,Fri Jun 26 21:39:48 2015 UTC,"Even so, Caitlin and Cisco really only worked together, whereas fitz/Simmons practically spent most of their adult life together, from the academy forwards."

When they were together they were so vanilla bland.  Once they split them apart and gave them different personalities, I actually started to find them both compelling characters."
shield,3b7b9q,MrAlaz,4,Thu Jul 9 19:32:36 2015 UTC,"I disagree; I love Arrow and The Flash. Yes, even Season 3 of Arrow. But then, I actually do not mind the melodrama and romance angles. In fact, I think that for the most part, they handle them pretty well. The only time that it really annoyed me was in Arrow S3 when Oliver pretty much went total control freak; I'm here saying come on dude, Thea trying to get Merlyn killed really isn't that horrible. Dude was a monster. That, and he kept refusing to train Laurel even after she had proven that she was dedicated to the cause (not that she should need his protection; she is an adult and can take care of herself), and moreover, he continued to criticize her fighting ability. So... why don't you train her, then? But of course, we later found out that Oliver had ulterior motives, so I guess that kind of explains it.  But see, one thing to remember is that in the Arrowverse, we are not watching spies and government agents. We are watching fairly average people living fairly average lives, aside from the superheroing that is. A love triangle in AoS wouldn't really work, but it is more plausible in the Arrowverse's more ""pedestrian"" setting."

What I don't love is how painfully they're trying to shoehorn that into mainstream comics when it couldn't be any further from how things have previously been established.  Cal ain't Mr. Hyde as we know him, and I think he SHOULDN'T be. And Skye and Quake aren't even all that similar...please let's not throw Secret Warriors out the window okay?"
shield,3ay4t4,rpmaluki,12,Wed Jun 24 17:04:07 2015 UTC,Part of what made TV Cal so great is that I was expecting him to be the comics' jerkass Mr. Hyde and he was not.
shield,3ay4t4,DBHT14,6,Wed Jun 24 17:59:09 2015 UTC,"I love AoS dearly but I didn't appreciate this issue as much as the others because I feel like they were forcing AoS too much on to the comic. I honestly didn't like it (which is a first), it felt like I was watching the show instead reading the comic. I know it's based on the TV show characters, but I was hoping there'd be a better way of meshing Skye and Daisy together without a complete retcon of Daisy's original story. I don't mind Coulson, May, Fitz and Simmons being carbon copies of their characters on the show because they've never existed before the movie/show, so it makes sense to keep them the same. Skye/Daisy was always going to be odd. in the comics, I anticipated this, I just wish they did a better job of telling Daisy story while giving small hints of Daisy being Skye without hitting us over the head with a sledge hammer.  Here's hoping they don't ruin the Mockingjay issue. I don't want to be disappointed a second time."
shield,3ay4t4,DBHT14,3,Wed Jun 24 20:17:40 2015 UTC,"Secret Avengers is all I need for hilarious Coulson fucking up people's day and Quake being in over her head.   There is also a cover of the entire team dressed like Rambo, I think it is from the new volume with Hill as director, but anyway he is getting some great love with the covers as well:  http://marvel.com/comics/issue/52441/secret_avengers_2014_13  http://marvel.com/comics/issue/50302/secret_avengers_2014_10  http://marvel.com/comics/issue/50290/secret_avengers_2014_2"
shield,3ay4t4,rpmaluki,4,Thu Jun 25 13:38:45 2015 UTC,The Secret Avengers run by Ales Kot that recently ended is just mindblowingly good/hilarious. The MCU needs Borges-addled MODOK in love with Maria Hill ASAP.
shield,3ay4t4,DBHT14,2,Thu Jun 25 15:51:38 2015 UTC,"The previous volume was no slouch either.  With Quake failing miserably as Director and eventually going off the reservation.   Plus it did a good job framing the question of plausible denial and how grey is too grey for an intelligence agency that is supposed to be working for the good guys.   Plus it has some great funny moments. My top being a panel where Hill is about to send Hawkeye and Black Widow out and they ask where Fury is and she tells them he is gone and Coulson is their only support.   Meanwhile he is in the background ready to go and gives them the Foonzy ""Ehh"" pose. Gold Jerry, Gold.  As an aside while a strong character I detest Maria Hill in virtually every time she gets involved."
shield,3ay4t4,rpmaluki,2,Thu Jun 25 16:01:14 2015 UTC,"I had no idea Coulson was in another SA volume, I absolutely love the guy, I will read any and maybe everything he's in. I still haven't read Battle Scars yet and don't know if I should."
shield,3ay4t4,DBHT14,2,Fri Jun 26 08:29:37 2015 UTC,"Yea the current Vol 3. is more or less the same core team as before. Hill as Director, Fury Jr and Coulson as the SHIELD guys, Black Widow, Hawkeye(which they make sort of funnier but also never bring up his being on the last team when BW they do), Spider Woman gets brought in too. And of course M.O.D.O.K. who defected to SHIELD.  So good stuff and I do loathe Maria Hill(X-Men fan first and she has been a super dick to them the last several years) so she has a few shitty days which I enjoy. And some of the best Deadpool scenes in living memory. Just imagine Deadpool Hawkeye and 2 A.I.M. goons having 3 legged races and pie eating contests."
shield,3ay4t4,louhikaarme,3,Fri Jun 26 13:09:32 2015 UTC,"I LOVE the Coulson/Hawkeye cover, my absolute favourite."
shield,3ay4t4,DBHT14,2,Thu Jun 25 13:53:36 2015 UTC,It is probably top 25 for me for best modern cover. Though im more an X-Men and Guardians of the Galaxy fan then Avengers/SHIELD.
shield,3ay4t4,rpmaluki,3,Thu Jun 25 14:19:36 2015 UTC,"Secret Avengers Vol 3 was the best thing I have read in years.   It was so funny! I loved all the characterizations art, and the humour. Even bad guys were loveable. Nowadays I rarely read comics over and over again, but that makes me feel so damn good that I probably know each issue by heart. :)   Totally fave. I would be more than happy to see this kind of quirky approach and general feelgood attitude in television or on the silver screen."
shield,3ay4t4,DBHT14,3,Thu Jun 25 17:22:06 2015 UTC,If you do enjoy that tone the two other current runs I would recommend are Star-Lord. Fun with some over the top action as Quill takes a bigger solo role and deals with the fallout of his father being deposed. Also he trys a long distance relationship with Kitty Pryde.  The other is Loki: Agent of Asgard.  Gets sort of meta with the idea of what makes a lie and what makes a story and multiple variations of Loki. But also some funny moments and some spy shenanigans with a magical twist.
shield,3ay4t4,louhikaarme,3,Thu Jun 25 17:43:51 2015 UTC,"Secret Avengers was fantastic. I love Loki: AoA but haven't read Star Lord, maybe I should pick it up and catch up."
shield,3ay4t4,DBHT14,2,Fri Jun 26 08:24:43 2015 UTC,If you enjoy the galactic side of 616 it and the Guardians run are just fine. Deals a lot on the early issues over having Nova die to save his life and Thanos survive.
shield,3ay4t4,DBHT14,2,Fri Jun 26 13:10:23 2015 UTC,"Hey, thanks! I already was on that Loki one, but haven't read Star-Lord. :)"
shield,3ay4t4,CapWasRight,2,Thu Jun 25 20:02:40 2015 UTC,"Easier to read in conjunction with the current Guardians run too because lets be honest they are HILARIOUS in almost every context. Plus some neat new liaisons from earth join up like Iron man,  Venom, and Capt Marvel all do tours in space.  O and Star Lord gets engaged and elected the new president of Spartax after his dad is overthrown."
shield,3ay4t4,rpmaluki,3,Thu Jun 25 20:05:08 2015 UTC,It is also possibly the best Deadpool shitshow moments in years.   The only one better I think is one of the X-Men events where he turns out to be spending all of it playing with dolls of the X-Men and gets dragged into the fight.
shield,3ay4t4,ChocolateAmerican,3,Thu Jun 25 17:46:27 2015 UTC,"Now that I've read the issue: yuck, it's even more forced than I thought.  Cal talking about his happiness at her birth worked great in the show; in the comics, the story had previously been that she was born to a prostitute and I don't even think he knew about her!  And how egregiously they all call her ""Skye"" at every opportunity.  Just...it's not necessary to do all this, Marvel, yeesh.  The comic doesn't even resemble the show in terms of what they're doing that much! (At least not before this issue, anyway.)"
shield,3ay4t4,Invictus227,2,Fri Jun 26 05:58:36 2015 UTC,"Exactly! I liked and enjoyed all the other issues except this one. This was completely unnecessary. At first I thought I was overreacting but I'm not. I don't know much of Daisy/Hyde's original story but I don't appreciate AoS' version hamfisted to fit the MU original. It's very abrasive and I speak as someone that has no prior exposure to the characters before the show. I won't kill them to keep AoS separate from MU, both are great in their own way, this mash attempt between the two just feels way too off for my liking. It's okay for original characters like FitzSimmons, May and Coulson but not so much for the others if it means their history gets retconned, fudged so much to fit Marvel's new take on the characters.   That's enough ranting for now. i honestly get what Marvel's trying to do, I just wish they did a better job at it."
shield,3ay4t4,OSUTechie,2,Fri Jun 26 08:17:22 2015 UTC,"I kinda sympathize with why they'd like to retcon TV Cal into the comics, as forced as it feels. TV Cal is a much more complex and interesting character. Comics Mr. Hyde is a sorta generic mad scientist Hulk-knockoff."

shield,3ay4t4,DBHT14,14,Wed Jun 24 15:37:31 2015 UTC,"It's set in the main Marvel comic universe, Marvel 616. These are the 616 versions of MCU SHIELD characters like Coulson, FitzSimmons, etc.  (Your question is actually kinda complicated right now, because the current Secret Wars comics event has blown up or mashed together all the Marvel universes, so there's supposedly no Marvel 616 anymore. But the SHIELD comic series has been so far unaffected by Secret Wars, and no one knows how or if the Marvel universes will fall out in the end, so for now you can safely ignore it.)"

shield,3ay4t4,Demileto,3,Wed Jun 24 18:16:46 2015 UTC,"Maybe this is post SW, because in the last issue Maria Hill was director. This is clearly a huge leap between the issues and very confusing. How did Phil become director of Shield? Where's Maria?"
shield,3ay4t4,rpmaluki,3,Thu Jun 25 05:39:13 2015 UTC,"Honestly... I would have liked the comics and MCU to stay as separate as possible. Using characters from AoS like Fitz and Simmons is totally cool - just playing with them in different universe, exploring opportunities, that is fun.   As much I love Coulson, him being director in comics, too... and Quake being called Skye... nope.   I'm already so terrified of what is coming out of Secret Wars and this isn't helping at all. :/  Anyhow, Coulson getting all Hyde was very entertaining.  I like the idea of SHIELD comics a lot, and these first issues have been enjoyable. But instead of these apparently totally unconnected one-shots it would be better if it had some continuity. By all means it can keep on being this ""one issue, one case""-thing without any huge story arc (quite what I wished for AoS to be), but stronger connections between issues would be nice, especially since  there is always different artist drawing (which by itself is very nice)."
shield,3ay4t4,Demileto,3,Thu Jun 25 08:07:12 2015 UTC,"Yea I feel like they are REALLY underselling comic Coulson. The dude is great in Secret Avengers, and I really want his nickname of Cheese to come up on screen.   Interesting enough this is not the first time a character from TV/Movies came first and made it into comics later.  The first was X-23 the female clone of Wolverine, showed up in X-Men:Evolution before the comics. The two guys who created her I actually just found out are Writing and Producing Thor: Ragnarok together after a baller few years on the comics team."
shield,3ay4t4,DBHT14,2,Thu Jun 25 13:33:08 2015 UTC,"I wanted the same. There's nothing wrong with keeping the two mediums separate, it's creates a better opportunity to expand the characters beyond the show, instead of repeating everything we've already seen on AoS."
shield,3ay4t4,rpmaluki,2,Thu Jun 25 10:31:40 2015 UTC,Is he really the director in the comics really? Maybe he's just a team leader as he used to be.

Mainly for 2 reasons.  1.) They wrote his contract after Agents of SHIELD was a thing, and could write a clause for appearances seperate from the movies in there. 2.) He isnt a big name actor at all. It would be hard getting someone like RDJ, or ScarJo to appear on a TV show when they are such big stars that command such big paychecks. Tom Holland is essentially an unknown which is a good thing in this situation."

I don't think they pulled it off that well; it was a strange story that didn't really go anywhere. I don't think it added anything to the story to have him run around like a fugitive and have Gonzalez etc storm his base.  Were we supposed to question Coulson's leadership abilities after we learned about Theta protocol? It turned out to be completely benevolent and Coulson, surprise, was being secretive because he was acting under orders. Or when he was on the run, were we supposed to wonder about him then? Because in the end all he had to do was tell Gonzalez and friends that he was acting under Fury and Hill's orders; when they learned Fury was alive and Coulson was in contact with Hill they immediately backed down. In the end all those episodes did was kill off a few characters and an arm, introduce Agent Weaver as some sort of advisor, introduce a mysterious Simmons-eating alien artifact, and introduce terragenesis-granting fish oil pills. All of that could have been done in a different way, it didn't need the Gonzalez story. Especially the fish oil pills; that one's a hard pill to swallow and I wish they'd chosen a different way of introducing mass terragenesis."
shield,3arury,Xetren,6,Tue Jun 23 15:25:32 2015 UTC,"I don't think we as viewers were really supposed to question him. We've been with the character for so long and have come to trust him, so there's no real believable way for the viewer to lose faith. I think it was there to give the viewer an understanding of why the other guys felt the way they did. The story was never really written from their perspective since they were never really the vehicle for the viewer. Else it would've really changed the tone of the show. So of course we don't trust them. They're the minor antagonists. The twist comes at the end where you realize their intentions were pure, but misguided. Whether you enjoyed it or not is a separate issue, but I felt that it was written effectively and competently. As for the ending, while I have mixed feelings about it, I don't think the point of the season was to set up the end and I think it misses the point to think that way.  Stories aren't necessarily written for the ending, they're written for the journey. Not every story exists to be a set up as purely a formality to get from point A to point B. I think the journey the characters went through this season was decent.  While I would be happier if the lead into Point B was a little better set up, I kinda understand the problem of sequelitis, where they have to set up for a continuation in the story. So if at least the journey can be written in an entertaining way, I'm happy enough.  EDIT: Also, the Gonzalez plot gave us a reasonable way to set up Coulson as an underdog again. Coulson was always our hero, and the Gonzalez team was a way for Coulson to face adversity as his first year as the leader of SHIELD. It gives the audience a reason to continue rooting for their hero."

I think the journey the characters went through this season was decent.   The journey could have been part of a story that also had a lasting impact on the plot, and arguably it should be otherwise what's the point of having that story in the show? It's just filler.  The realSHIELD story didn't add anything unique to the plot. 1) It was too easily resolved; it didn't cost the main characters anything and we didn't learn anything about the main characters that we didn't already know. 2) virtually all the characters introduced by it were killed off in a few episodes. So why even have that in the show? Journey is good, but journey that meanders from the story and doesn't have an impact beyond those self-contained episodes is a journey that doesn't add to the plot is arguably a waste of time.    Yes, characters died and Coulson lost his arm, and Cal lost his memory, and terragenesis fish pills are now a thing. But none of those things required the realSHIELD storyline; if that storyline had been cut it wouldn't have had an impact on the other events except shuffling them around a little.

What would you rather have?  Because of Real SHIELD we had Skye almost switch sides, May doubt Coulson, And more depth to Bobbi and Macs characters. If it weren't for Real SHIELD Skye would have had no reason to stay in Afterlife. And what would they have done with Wards character? Coulson wouldn't of had any reason to turn to Ward, Bobbi wouldn't have had that development in 21 & 22. and Simmons wouldn't have been sucked into the Kree Rock.  I'm sure there's more that i missed. How would you have introduced all this without the Real SHIELD plot?"
shield,3arury,zmamma,1 point,Wed Jun 24 20:55:09 2015 UTC,"Since you asked. Re Skye going to Afterlife, maybe have the team react adversely to her sudden superpowers, have her feel uncomfortable with being Indexed, and have her turn to Gordon with questions. This could also have divided May and Coulson, with one of them more sympathetic to Skye than the other. Maybe Coulson feels torn between his duty as Director and his paternal feelings for Skye. Or have it go the other way with May not trusting Coulson's judgment because he's being too easy on Skye  Ward was off doing his own thing during most of realSHIELD anyway, and he could have intercepted Bobbi any number of different ways. He just needed an opportunity. He could have been brought in to help with a different mission, too, and Simmons could still have used the opportunity to try and kill him.  The Kree Rock could have been anywhere. Maybe instead of abandoning and destroying the Kree City, they left a team behind to study it. The team in the city finds references to a super weapon, the Kree Rock, and Coulson sends a group to follow up on it. Let's say Jaiying has someone keep track of Coulson's team because she doesn't trust SHIELD, and she knows they've been researching the Kree City cause Skye or Raina told her that. When Jaiying finds out SHIELD is after the Kree Rock, she flips out. Goes to war against them like she did with Gonzales. Decides to transform them all so they won't have a choice but to leave the Rock alone. It ends the same way, contained and being studied, and Simmons gets eaten by it at the end of the season.  As for Bobbi and Mac, well, Bobbi can still get captured and tortured like she was. Ward just needs an opportunity to grab her. So that plays out the same. Mac loses some development, yeah, and their secret doesn't go anywhere. I'm not sure what else their secret could be, maybe that they're keeping tabs on Coulson for Fury.  eta If it had played out this way, I'd have the team, not outsiders, question Coulson's leadership. He'd be more likely to doubt himself if they doubted him; and the biggest reason they didn't trust him wouldn't have been Theta Protocol, it woudl have been something to do with Inhumans or Kree technology (maybe how he handled Skye, maybe how he handled the Kree Rock, something like that). Orrr Theta Protocol wouldn't have been ""secret helicarrier"" it would have been something much more controversial and dangerous."

shield,3arsbi,Thedmatch,18,Tue Jun 23 15:23:38 2015 UTC,"Civilians. In particular, protecting them, or giving them aid after an attack. When Coulson sat with that firefighter in FZZT, he won my heart. S2 was conspicuously missing anything of the kind, and there were a few times in particular that bothered me. Whatever become of the nurse whose memory Vintak erased? The high schoolers Cal attacked? Just a 2 second shot of some agent providing aid would go a long way in making it feel like SHIELD is actually focused on protecting people, not just hunting their personal enemies who conveniently happen to be really bad guys. Relationship scenes, between the original characters and with new characters and with different characters. Lincoln and Fitz. Hunter and Skye. Skimmons, of course, since they only spent like a minute together. May and Mack (seriously, have they even met? J/K, but come on) Dr. Garner and Ward. Seriously, you can't have a character that fucked up and a psychiatrist and NOT put them in a room together."
shield,3arsbi,Bookbringer,5,Tue Jun 23 03:43:32 2015 UTC,Garner and Ward is a must it would be great if they were in a hostage situation and Garner got to Ward or at least got through to him on some level making Ward display an unusual act of mercy.
shield,3arsbi,Bookbringer,2,Tue Jun 23 21:16:12 2015 UTC,"I was thinking that! It would be cool if Ward were persuaded to spare someone he really hated like May or Bobbi by appealing to his (limited, but not missing) compassion. Example: if Dr. Garner or Hunter countered his ""she deserves to die"" with a ""but I don't deserve to lose her"" type appeal -- because he wouldn't want them to suffer like he did with Kara.  IMO, an act of mercy towards someone he hated would be a much better redemption (or redemption start) than sacrificing his life because it would be a lot harder for him.  At the very least it might be nice for us (and Ward himself) to be given some insight into his feelings/ thoughts/ behavior."

I'd really like to see something like Skye save May's life somehow, student becoming the teacher kind of thing. I'd like to see Simmons really affected and maybe traumatised by whatever happened to her because I think Elizabeth Henstridge is a great actress and I'd like to see her sink her teeth into a great storyline like that.  I think it would be interesting for Simmons to have been gone for a while and in season three she comes back (from whatever happened), but Fitz has moved on with someone else, and so the third season is kind of a parallel to the second where Fitz was the one dealing with stuff and now it's Simmons. As long as it ends with them FINALLY getting together.  More badass action, the first season was a little lame in their action stuff I thought, everything felt so staged and choreographed but by the end of the second season they got tremendously better.

Nazism was just a vehicle for control. That's why they slipped so easily into SHIELD, an organization full of people with likely zero affinity for Nazi idealism. SHIELD agents were susceptible to the same egocentric ideology as the Nazis, but they were convinced that control was for the good of mankind. I've always felt like Hydra had two types of people, those who want power for the sake of power, and those that actually believe the Hydra ideology, that people are a danger to themselves and need an overseer.

shield,3apa0k,quontemplation,2,Mon Jun 22 17:48:27 2015 UTC,"Skye explicitly says to Ward that SHIELD considers Hydra to be a Nazi organization. Red Skull definitely considered himself to be more important in the organizational hierarchy than Hitler, but there's really no evidence that their fundamental ideologies weren't aligned, and Hydra's contemporary strategy (systematically, rapidly wipe out anyone who poses a threat to total Hydra supremacy) is entirely too close to Nazi ideology for it to be reasonable to try to make any distinction between them without any further information.  I feel like efforts to suggest otherwise are due to people wanting to root for villains without having to address the fact that those villains are ideologically nearly indistinguishable from Nazis, which is... disconcerting, to say the least."

They will discuss it but it won't be a huge plot point just similar to the age of ultron tie in. The registration act affects those like Daredevil, Jessica Jones and the Avengers because they are in the public eye. The nature of Secret Warriors is staying secret from the public eye. They are suppose to stay  anonymous. If you really think about it the secret warriors are registered with shield already so how can they have any say in the civil war?."
shield,3amb9k,SwagBelow,5,Sun Jun 21 17:59:02 2015 UTC,It's enforcement. Perhaps they're divided between who wants to enforce the law on other enhanced and who doesn't?
shield,3amb9k,SwagBelow,4,Sun Jun 21 18:49:55 2015 UTC,Yeah I get that but Shield itself is against the law.Shield is still an organization that is not part of the government and has no power. All the people who followed Coulson know that.So it would not make sense for them to get involved with the  Registration Act because they are already breaking the law and the Registration Act does not affect them directly just the avengers and other superheroes like Spider-man and Black Panther and maybe the Netflix people.

The new status quo fractures the Avengers while they try to protect the world from a new and nefarious villain.

shield,3amb9k,Bookbringer,2,Sun Jun 21 17:29:56 2015 UTC,"While it's likely next season will feature the formation of an enhanced team, it's also possible that Coulson's comments were more of a nod to Skye's comic book storyline than foreshadowing a major point of S3. The Civil War tie-in will definitely involve the main cast being torn between the two sides, but it won't be big, and I doubt we'll be introduced to any major movie plot points. It'll be little teases that fit around the movie, on par with what we got for AoU."
shield,3amb9k,PhuturePhil,3,Sun Jun 21 19:07:01 2015 UTC,"Civil War movie most likely won't be very similar to the comic storyline, so the secret identities will not be prevalent.  I think going along those lines the whole secret warriors team being split by registration wont happen since registration wont be an issue in the movie.    It seems to be moving more along the line of who tells the New Avengers team what to do and holds them accountable, and since Shield is an underground organization in the MCU right now I dont believe they will have any kind of say or stakes in the argument.  Sure, they could join up with Cap and take a ""side"" but I just don't see it playing out like that unfortunately."

Shield aren't good guys. They're just good compared to Hydra. I don't expect any major tie-in in that regard. I can't imagine any member of shield being split on this. They're already doing it."

shield,3amb9k,OsteoBiflex,1 point,Tue Jun 23 03:05:37 2015 UTC,Well their not in the movie anyway so it doesn't much matter. But if the writers want to use CW as a source of conflict in the team they'll do that. They've been on opposite sides of arguments in the past and there's no reason this can't be the same.   The Civil War isn't about joining people you've met. It's about where your opinion falls in the discussion of Registration.
shield,3amb9k,Regard87,1 point,Tue Jun 23 11:21:25 2015 UTC,That is true but in my opinion Fitz and Skye should not have an opinion about civil war. I mean Skye and Fitz already work with an organization that is already like the SHRA. They use use the index all the time and people on it and those two have been ok with it and Skyes is even on it. Actually no shield agent on the show has ever spoke about how messed up it is. So civil should not suddenly change there opinion.

They would be required to register their powered individuals to continue operations on American soil. We could see fracturing of the team(s).

shield,3ak9qs,Xetren,22,Sun Jun 21 01:19:12 2015 UTC,"You need space to store mothballed equipment. We have lots of these types of ""graveyards"" in the real world. One of the most well known ones is the aircraft graveyard in the Mojave desert where retired airframes are stored in very low humidity conditions that slow down rusting.  We know that SHIELD retired at least one old Helicarrier when the newer Project Insight ones were built. Theta Protocol is the refurbishment, refitting and operational reactivation of one of those old Helicarriers. But of course that means this old Helicarrier must have been stored somewhere prior to Theta Protocol. That somewhere would be a SHIELD vehicle graveyard, which would be really cool to see in a movie or in the show."
shield,3ak9qs,aerosplat,12,Sun Jun 21 01:30:08 2015 UTC,"Right... except that aside from the Insight Helicarriers from Winter Soldier (which were all destroyed), it appeared that SHIELD had just the one we saw in Avengers.  So the Theta Protocol Base was probably where it was being kept in mothballs..."
shield,3ak9qs,jerslan,4,Sun Jun 21 04:56:49 2015 UTC,"Theta Protocol isn't a base. It's an operation. They obviously used some base somewhere to refit the Helicarrier, but it makes no sense to call it a Theta Protocol base. That base, like the Helicarrier, quite likely existed before Fury and Coulson thought of Theta Protocol. And more importantly, we don't know where the Helicarrier was kept prior to Theta Protocol's inception. We don't know which base Theta Protocol used to refit the Helicarrier for service. We don't know any of this with any certainty.  Now, that said, the standard operating procedure for any real world military organization is to have some chunk of land where they indefinitely store some of their retired, decommissioned vehicles. It's from this ""graveyard"" that these vehicles can either be recycled piecemeal or just sold into private ownership after disarmament.  In light of that, it's very reasonable to suggest that SHIELD likely had some kind of a ""graveyard"" (don't take this word literally please) base where they stored defunct equipment and vehicles. We're not just talking about Helicarriers here. Old trucks, old planes, old everything. Just large stuff that isn't easy to break down or strip. Stuff that you don't want to leave to rot. Stuff that is old, but not that old, so you want to preserve it rust-free in some form just in case you need it.  OP is simply expressing enthusiasm that it would be cool to see a place like that in the movies or in the show. A little glimpse of what kind of stuff SHIELD used over the years. A bit of history. And I agree, it would be cool.  I'm not sure, however, why there is any opposition to that idea. It's not based on unreasonable assumptions. In fact it makes a helluva lot more sense than some ""Theta Protocol base""."
shield,3ak9qs,aerosplat,3,Sun Jun 21 05:13:28 2015 UTC,"What I would love to see that comes from this ""graveyard"" is another one of those planes that was Coulsin and his team's base for all of season 1. Hell, that plane was cool."

You'd think I'd called someone's mom a $0.05/hour whore by the way you bit my head off there....   Theta Protocol isn't a base.   Never said it was, but clearly there was a base dedicated to the operation. That's all I was referring to. Since we don't have a name for the base, I simply referred to it as the Theta Protocol Base.   the standard operating procedure for any real world military organization   SHIELD doesn't even remotely resemble such an organization.   it's very reasonable to suggest that SHIELD likely had some kind of a ""graveyard""   Possibly. It's also possible that SHIELD wouldn't want the tech behind the Helicarrier to fall into ""enemy"" hands, so they hid it at a base where it could be safely decommissioned. That base could be the same one we saw used for Theta Protocol.   OP is simply expressing enthusiasm that it would be cool to see a place like that in the movies or in the show. A little glimpse of what kind of stuff SHIELD used over the years. A bit of history. And I agree, it would be cool.   Never disagreed with that.. Not sure why that's an issue here.  You also never manage to refute the problem with OP suggesting there are multiple helicarriers out there, when we don't know that SHIELD ever had more than the one we've seen (aside from Project Insight)."
shield,3ak9qs,jerslan,1 point,Sun Jun 21 15:25:02 2015 UTC,"I'd say, from what we know of Fury, there are sure to be old helicarriers and the like around somewhere.

shield,3ao3et,EmperorJoker,18,Mon Jun 22 02:41:56 2015 UTC,"this has to be the craziest theory i have ever read. of all time. Why can't a character have a normal backround? Not everyone has to have some super awesome or tragic past you know.  I honestly feel like this story would make zero sense, not to be rude or anything."
shield,3ao3et,Xetren,8,Mon Jun 22 04:10:26 2015 UTC,"So basically you want Simmons to become a rehash of Ward? Because ""tragic past turning the character into a monster"" is HIS story, not hers.   If Simmons was to take a similar path we'd have been given clues already, however subtle they may have been, but we haven't and we won't. We don't know anything about her life pre-SHIELD because it's not unique enough to be story-worthy, it's as simple as that, should we ever learn anything about her past we'd get it in the same way we got from Coulson's, May's and Fitz's: occasional bits and pieces when the story allows them to be interwoven in the narrative in a natural way."
shield,3ao3et,Demileto,7,Mon Jun 22 10:26:09 2015 UTC,"So basically you want Simmons to become a rehash of Ward? Because ""tragic past turning the character into a monster"" is HIS story, not hers.   And Cal's story. And Jiaying's. And Bakshi's (according to Bobbi's faux-psychiatric assessment). And kind of Kara's, though monster is pushing it.  Even Garrett's, if you believe he was a good agent before SHIELD left him to die. Dethlok, for a surprisingly non-evil version.  So basically, it's been done and done to death. We do NOT need to see this again."
shield,3ao3et,Bookbringer,2,Mon Jun 22 16:40:45 2015 UTC,"Good point, I singled out Ward because he's the one who's a regular and used to be part of the team, but yeah, that's not exclusive to him."
shield,3ao3et,Demileto,2,Mon Jun 22 17:00:22 2015 UTC,"Plus, it's such prominent, integral part of his he defines and identifies himself, whereas for some of the others, it's more of a throwaway explanation for why they are the way they are."
shield,3ao3et,Bookbringer,0,Mon Jun 22 17:08:12 2015 UTC,"I know I'm not talking about Simmons becoming a ""My parents were mean to me please feel sorry for me."" type of villain I'm talking about her becoming a villain who when asked why she's doing what she's doing says ""Um let's see my uncle bad touched me, my parents didn't love me or hug me enough, I was born with an inability to feel empathy, I mean really the list goes on. You know I think we are going to skip the true Hollywood sob story so you can start serving your purpose."" type villain."
shield,3ao3et,Demileto,3,Mon Jun 22 18:34:03 2015 UTC,"I vastly prefer villains like Whitehall where they don't even try to make us feel sorry for them myself, but Simmons really is the worst choice ever for this as Bookbringer explained in his big post in this thread."
shield,3ao3et,Bookbringer,2,Mon Jun 22 20:17:31 2015 UTC,"I enjoy both kinds as long as they're well done. Whitehall was great, because you didn't ever empathize or agree with him, but it was easy to believe in him.  At no point did his evil feel over the top of implausible or hammed up to give the heroes an excuse to fight him.  That said, I do enjoy it when works introduce a villain who's so sympathetic, you struggle with rooting against them."
shield,3ao3et,Demileto,2,Tue Jun 23 03:13:43 2015 UTC,"Having watched two shows prior to Agents of SHIELD whose producers seemed obsessed with making all their villains sympathic, Vampire Diaries and - especially - Once Upon a Time, I'm rather burned out with the idea. Villains don't generally need a backstory to explain why they do what they do, it can be as simple as 'power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely'."
shield,3ao3et,Bookbringer,3,Tue Jun 23 10:23:31 2015 UTC,"To an extent -- but as someone who loves a lot of fantasy like LOTR and Harry Potter, I'm a little burned out on the ""Well, he's just evil, he's always been evil, and he'll always be evil because there's no good in him"" type villains. I like it when people have, at the very least, realistic motives.  But I see where you're coming from.  I didn't get into Once Upon a Time, but I liked Vampire Diaries. There's a huge line between humanizing a villain and essentially using their tragic past to whitewash/ justify their crimes, and Vampire Diaries crossed that line regularly and flagrantly (how often do the ""good"" vampires murder innocent people and how often do other ""good"" characters cover it up for them? Seriously, and that's not even the villains who mostly all have body counts higher than... IDK a really tall building).  So IMO, it's a line. I like that AoS seems to give us both kinds of villains and that she seem pretty well done."
shield,3ao3et,Bookbringer,1 point,Tue Jun 23 13:47:15 2015 UTC,"O... Kaaaaaaay. So you're saying you basically want Elizabeth Henstridge to play a completely different character? A character who doesn't really have a traumatic last, but is just rattling off lies? Or what?  Because, I would say most of our traumatized-into-villainy characters are closer to the second example than the first. Jiaying and Cal's story is a trainwreck of tragedy -- what with Jiaying being cut on and opened up and fully conscious for a week, having and seeing her organs stuffed into jars, brought back through the murders of innocents, and thdn finding out that her baby was kidnapped by the same monsters that tortured her while her husband was out looking to rescue her. And Cal has that happening to his family, then being brain-cooked by his own science experiments.  And Ward's story is definitely not, ""my parents were mean to me, feel sorry."" His older brother tried to force him to commit murder, and yet he describes his parents as ""worse"" -- and Christian, who doesn't seem given to hyperbole, describes it as ""torture"" -- then, on top of all that, he was recruited by a Nazi Death Cult, isolated from human society by a dying narcissist, subjected to actual cult brainwashing practices... All before he was an adult? And, of course, there's totally the debate that maybe he was just born that way...  So yeah... I don't think your theory makes any sense or is grounded in anything we've seen in the show at all."
shield,3ao3et,JohnathanMc92,5,Mon Jun 22 21:43:30 2015 UTC,"WTF?? Man, I know where you were coming from, but isn't it a bit, I don't know, too much? I'd like Simmons to remain who she is: funny, quirky, sexy in a dorky way. She is one half of FitzSimmons, after all."
shield,3ao3et,Bookbringer,6,Mon Jun 22 03:00:20 2015 UTC,"she's always been so perky I find it odd.   Always? Bit of an exaggeration -- we've seen her upset, sad, furious, resolved, hesitant, scared, protective. And frankly, there's a much simpler explanation for her usual perkiness. Maybe, like many people, she sometimes masks her negative feelings to be liked or to please others. Or, you know, she's just genuinely a cheerful person.   I just keep thinking she's hiding something and it's big. Like she's a closet psycho who killed the real Jemma Simmons and assumed her identity just because she didn't pass a psych eval and was unable to get into the SHIELD academy under her real name. Which quite frankly would be a great story.   That would be a really cool story if it made sense and weren't totally incompatible with most of what we've seen. We've seen Jemma be selfless and caring (willing to sacrifice herself for the team in FZZT, trying to refuse the extra oxygen in the medpod, carrying Fitz from the bottom of the ocean).  And Fitz has known her since they were teenagers. Plus, she regularly talks to her parents.   Even after a trauma like what happened to Tripp you don't just become unempathetic towards your friend (like how she was with Skye)   Jemma was never unempathetic to Skye -- she didn't know how close to home her fearful comments on genetic mutation were striking. When she learned Skye was affected too, she changed her tune somewhat, and focused on trying to help /  fix her (and it should be noted being ""cured"" of her powers is what Skye herself wanted). Also, it wasn't just Tripp dying. It was nearly dying herself in FZZT from a Chitauri illness, being betrayed and nearly killed by Ward, watching Fitz struggle with brain damage, working with genocide-happy HYDRA mooks, learning of their plans to create weapons of mass destruction from the obelisk/ diviner, seeing Raina kill 2 agents under her supervision.   I mean she's able to kill without remorse. At the very least she's a narcissist whose charismatic and charming enough that people don't notice or she's a real text book psychopath.   Jemma displays no symptoms of either of those disorders. Her cold reaction to killing Bakshi is more likely due to the fact that she is more rational than emotional and can compartmentalize/ suppress her emotions well. However, if she truly lacks any remorse for him, it's not evidence of a psychopathy. Many of the protagonists -- Skye, May, Coulson, Hunter -- have shot HYDRA agents and criminals without evidence of regret or pity. This is likely because, as with real-world military and law enforcement agencies, SHIELD agents are conditioned to accept killing ""designated bad guys"" for the good of society. It's an exaggeration of natural in-group/ out-group morality, not a lack of empathy.   She's literally the only character whose past hasn't been explored or so much as touched on. I suspect that contrary to her demeanor she's probably from a very poor and abusive background but hides it real well.   We know less about Fitz's background than hers.  Also, any reason for suspecting that? She doesn't act like she's been poor or abused, and she has a good relationship with both parents.   I think this because we've learned that other character's have been through horrible ordeals but none of it has ever been like Silence of the Lambs/Misery/American Psycho horrible.   Really? I would argue that Ward's story could easily reach those depths. One of the few things he and Christian agreed on is that their parents were worse -- which given that at least one of them attempted murder as a child -- is pretty horrifying."

For starters, the analogy of superheroes to real-world persecuted groups isn't nearly as clever or accurate as writers think it is.  People basically expected Simmons to know everything that the fans know. She doesn't know what the Inhumans are, it could be a contagious plague for all she knew and she had no reason to think otherwise.  We know that Skye's powers can eventually be used and controlled because we read it in the comics. But for every hero origin story, there's one exactly like it that produces a villain, or at least an uncontrollable loose canon.  I find these fans just as annoying as obnoxious people who yell at horror movies because the character is stupid for walking down into the dark basement. No, they're not stupid, they don't know they're in a horror movie, they're not fucking Deadpool."

shield,3af2dn,PM_ME_YOUR_IRIS,-7,Sat Jun 20 01:17:02 2015 UTC,I doubt anybody would be fucking Deadpool if given the chance except that vampire he married.
shield,3af2dn,Bookbringer,7,Fri Jun 19 17:25:51 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I feel like as long as they do justice to both characters and don't flanderize/demonize either one, I'm OK with any relationship -- friends, lovers, enemies (temporarily) or some on again/ off again combination. But if they fight, I want them to end up making up eventually."
shield,3af2dn,enforcetheworld,7,Sat Jun 20 00:07:50 2015 UTC,"Mack was the most interesting character of season 2, and it was a shame they didn't do more with him and Fitz being buddies in the beginning of the season."
shield,3af2dn,Addy6,25,Sat Jun 20 06:00:55 2015 UTC,"Here's a real unpopular opinion: I don't like Skye's story and I don't like that she's a main character. I like the supporting cast, and I like her character when she isn't the focus of everything that happens in the show. But I don't like that everything's connected to her. In fact I'll probably stop watching if her Secret Warriors storyline is the main story next season, which it will be."
shield,3af2dn,Spidermini,17,Fri Jun 19 18:30:57 2015 UTC,I completely agree. I like her character this season and want her in the show and recognise she has come a long way since the early days of season one but I don't like the way she is at the centre of everything. The title suggests the show is about a team and I feel that means story and screentime should be weighted more evenly.
shield,3af2dn,NinetyFish,9,Fri Jun 19 19:09:15 2015 UTC,And her amazing fighting skills in one year.
shield,3af2dn,imjustbettr,4,Sat Jun 20 01:54:50 2015 UTC,And the slow motion shots during her fights
shield,3af2dn,securitywyrm,15,Sat Jun 20 02:46:41 2015 UTC,"Those are cool as shit, but I'd rather see May, Ward, Bobbi, or even maybe Hunter have those scenes. They're portrayed as the longtime professionals, Skye's a hotheaded rookie."
shield,3af2dn,detourne,8,Sat Jun 20 07:02:21 2015 UTC,Completely agree. I'll add that even though Choe Bennet is better in season 2 she's really not a great actor IMO. I seriously could not stand her in season 1 and I tolerated her character/actor in season 2. Every time she's on screen I'm just wondering what the other characters are doing.
shield,3af2dn,securitywyrm,8,Fri Jun 19 22:20:05 2015 UTC,Yeah. The strength of Shield has always been the setting rather than the characters.
shield,3af2dn,Rfwill13,8,Fri Jun 19 18:39:38 2015 UTC,"I think this is the real unpopular opinion here. I've never been a fan of the characters on the show, but I was totally gung ho about the world-building and fleshing out of the MCU. It would be fantastic if SHIELD became more of an anthology series where there are multiple teams conducting multiple missions around the world."
shield,3af2dn,catdoctor,4,Sat Jun 20 02:47:28 2015 UTC,Indeed. The characters have about as much depth as a Bleach character.
shield,3af2dn,NjallTheViking,3,Sat Jun 20 02:57:02 2015 UTC,I was really having a hard time watching as a lot last season because of Skye's story. I started watching because I loved the adventures of SHIELD and wanted more of that. I don't care about this powered stuff. I probably would if the Inhumans movie was around the corner.
shield,3af2dn,emma_pops,5,Fri Jun 19 21:43:37 2015 UTC,"I agree. I still find Skye to be the least interesting character, and Chloe to be the least interesting actor on the show."

shield,3af2dn,Addy6,6,Sat Jun 20 04:22:11 2015 UTC,It isn't unpopular. I also agree with you I like her but I'm sick of her getting 3 times as much screen time as any of the of the other characters. As a Fitzsimmons fan I felt most of s2 was just us being thrown scraps by the writers whilst they continued their ode to Skye.
shield,3af2dn,UberEpicZach,7,Fri Jun 19 20:15:16 2015 UTC,"That's where I am. Skye is great, and I really do love Chloe. Literally my only problem with her/ her storyline seems to be that sometimes other characters feel short-changed or even derailed to further her story."
shield,3af2dn,SmokeSignalSky,6,Sat Jun 20 00:47:45 2015 UTC,"Eh I honestly thought it was; the most popular comments I""ve seen here are usually about how awesome Skye is and how amazing her storyline was. That's probably confirmation bias or something.  And yeah, I'd like to see more Fitz & Simmons, less ode to Skye."
shield,3af2dn,ARflash,5,Fri Jun 19 20:17:06 2015 UTC,Yes! To all of that.

shield,3af2dn,Dregride,9,Fri Jun 19 21:30:28 2015 UTC,"Yes, I know. That wasn't how the show was advertised, though, so I feel a bit ripped off. I didn't want to watch a superhero's origin story."
shield,3af2dn,htallen,3,Fri Jun 19 21:35:07 2015 UTC,"Exactly. This show is billed as a story about how not all heroes have to have powers to be super. And now it's the story of somebody getting powers and becoming a superhero, basically. I'm still totally invested in the show because I love all the other characters and the team dynamic, but I wish that wasn't the direction it was headed."
shield,3af2dn,alienfrog,3,Mon Jun 22 20:53:54 2015 UTC,My complaint with Skye is gone after they revealed she is quake. Now I dont mind her having screen time. I can see your point though
shield,3af2dn,Arion_Miles,5,Sat Jun 20 01:39:49 2015 UTC,Agreed. With shows like The Flash or Arrow viewers know they are buying into a story with a main hero character from the very beginning. If Agents of shield is supposed to be this big origin story for Skye it feels like it came out of nowhere. They didnt call the show 'Quake'.
shield,3af2dn,htallen,3,Sat Jun 20 01:10:44 2015 UTC,"I'd say I disagree . If Skye's story wasn't so tied to the non shield mythology of the show than nobody would be complaining. After a season and a half of primarily focusing on shield and than later hydra the mythology her story is tied to got prominence but still had to share its time with shield. I've always been against the idea that Skye is the main character of the show and that it all revolves around her. That's for coulson, he's been the primary guy for most of the showand yet the focus has for the most part been an ensamble focus. What I can believe however is that she's the second main character. Which makes sense since her story has always come second to coulsons and only recently obtained temporary primary prominence. And even then in the end it all came back to coulson and shield. Just my two cents"
shield,3af2dn,Arion_Miles,5,Sat Jun 20 01:10:15 2015 UTC,"It's funny how we can see the same story so differently. To me even Coulson's story ends up tying back into Skye. His resurrection turned out to be the key to her transformation, for example."
shield,3af2dn,TheWistfulWanderer,13,Sat Jun 20 01:21:46 2015 UTC,"Simmons will become a Super-villain, she will somehow threaten all the Inhumans, and Skye will have to kill her."

Humans are complicated IRL. I'd like to see that reflected in this part of the show..."

shield,3af2dn,8eat-mesa,61,Fri Jun 19 21:46:17 2015 UTC,"I've said it before and I'll say it again - ""Yes Men"" is one of the worst episodes of television I've ever seen. This is made worse by the fact that it's so far beneath the quality level I'm used to with this show.  Having sat through it twice and seen events like Simmons declaring that ""all men are weak"" (this coming from a woman who leaves little puddles on the floor every time a black man visits), the casual disregard for Lorelei's victims and the fact that Ward was raped and then we focus on May's feelings about this, I can't help but wonder if the writer has a serious problem with the male gender.  And that's ignoring the fact that the stock Sci-Fi story where an evil woman mind controls all the men so the women have to save the day is completely outdated, especially on a show where women save the day every week.

May: smirk  Fitz: ""I don't know what she's talking about.""  I swear to fucking God, I expected a sitcom laugh track after that line.  I hate when shows jerk themselves off about being empowering to women while being sexist towards women. May is made out to be a strong woman while spending that entire episode jealous that her boy toy was forced to fuck another woman. Sif is made out to be a strong woman even though her literal only character trait is that she has a schoolgirl crush on Thor.  It's the exact same problem I had with Agent Carter and how everyone jerks that show off for being ""empowering"" to women."

The bikers Lorelei mind controls are hostages. So, naturally, S.H.I.E.L.D. sends in a heavily armed team that doesn't hesitate to use deadly force against them. They don't even bother with ICErs. Not to mention the giant Asgardian waving a sword around.  The episode is the embodiment of the Men are the Expendable Gender trope.  Also, let's forget that May and Ward were doing it. She's supposed to be his friend!  Don't get me started on Peggy Punch."

I'm rewatching season 1 and I feel like we didn't get enough time to see what SHIELD was like and how they operated. I understand this was due to Captain American 2 and the main MCU plan, but it ended up making SHIELD feel disorganized and weak.  I'm hoping that SHIELD is coming back together now that Coulson's group is friendly with ""real shield"". I want a new base working with the one in Avengers 2."

shield,3af2dn,IAmARedditorAMAA,4,Fri Jun 19 22:06:18 2015 UTC,"I liked the more formulaic, status-quo maintaining shows at the beginning of season one.  I get that more serialized shows are much more of a standard than they used to be, but I grew up shows like TNG, where overarching story was very uncommon.  Frankly, I think the serialized style is way too tense, blue-balling, and just gives you an extra reason to stop watching the show if you happen to miss an episode."

It was (seemed) lighter. I laughed more watching. Maybe I'm simple, but I would have liked less complicated and even silly stuff.  I wanted to see a show of SHIELD agents and their job behind the scenes. About boring, ordinary people doing what they need to do amongst the weird sci-fi stuff their job throws at them.

shield,3af2dn,securitywyrm,12,Sat Jun 20 05:58:42 2015 UTC,"I have seen fans wondering about that, but not many outright argue it. However, there's no in-universe reason why they can't be - amazing as she is, Romanov is ultimately just a mortal SHIELD agent too.  It's even implied in the episode, Melinda, that May (not Mei) was Coulson's first pick to assist him with the Avengers initiative, which probably means she would've filled the role Romanov occupied in the early films (checking out Tony Stark, etc...) had she not been traumatized by Bahrain.  There may be an in universe reason why May and Ward aren't in the Avengers, but the real reason is because they were created for the show and exist in a different franchise. And also Ward is evil."
shield,3af2dn,Marmadukian,5,Sat Jun 20 00:33:31 2015 UTC,"Plus, Black Widow and Hawkeye were always supposed to be the ""less useful"" (note, I'm not saying that they're worthless or not good, they're amazing characters) ones of the team, Hawkeye's wife even makes mention of that by saying that he's, excuse the paraphrasing, ""a man among gods... but they need you."" The spectacular agents in Agents of SHIELD should be able to stand among the Avengers to fulfill important functions, but I know that many (specifically on /r/marvelstudios) cast that idea aside, but I feel like doing that just serves as a way to bring down and dehumanize those characters.  The Avengers need the little guys just as much as the big guys. Their leader, Captain America, would probably understand that."

There was this huge build up to ""Who is Skye's mom?"" and then it was such a huge let down.   As an extension of that... I think a lot of the acting and writing is sub-par for a show that originally had such high expectations. A lot of the plot lines have so much potential and then are way under done. (Ex: they found an alien city half way through season 2. An alien city. Give it two episodes and you never hear about what happens to the damn thing)  I also don't like how most of the time Skye is written as a really tough agent who has been through a lot, but once somebody gets a scratch she breaks down and has the bravery of a four year old."

shield,3af2dn,dreamycreamy93,7,Sat Jun 20 00:09:16 2015 UTC,"Ward is easily the best written character on the show.  While I like the characters, they're all common archetypes. The tortured warrior, the hotheaded but good-hearted rookie, the all-loving leader, the awkward but kind supporting characters, the tough on the outside but teddy bear on the inside big guy, the wisecracking wildcard, etc. Like I said, cliches aren't bad, but they aren't as deep as originality can take you.  Ward is amazing. You honestly can't tell what he's up to, and he always thinks he's justified in whatever he's doing. That scene where he and his brother monologued at the same time about the evils of the other brother was breathtaking, and the best thing the show has ever done. You honestly could not tell what was true and what was a lie, and it really helped grow the true gray-ness of Ward.  edit: Actually, thinking about it more, Ward and Cal are the top tier of the show as genuinely well-written, creative, and compelling characters. Everyone else exists on a fun but generic tier."
shield,3af2dn,Dregride,1 point,Sat Jun 20 07:07:52 2015 UTC,I kept seeing people calling him plain/vanilla in the first season before the turn. I only liked him/Coulson and Fitz. May is a little too over the top IMO.

shield,3af2dn,kemj25,3,Sat Jun 20 02:26:11 2015 UTC,"I do not like Skye. I hoped she would get better after season 1, an she has, but throughout the show she's so incredulous and childish. Her powers have toughened her up though so we'll see.  Also, the idea that she could hold her own against May in hand to hand combat after brief training (relative to May's career/lifetime experience) is bullspit."
shield,3af2dn,adedward,4,Sat Jun 20 05:06:42 2015 UTC,"I have no idea if this is an unpopular opinion, but I really loathe the idea of Skye and Lincoln getting a thing going on, fuck that bullshit. Seems like they always want Skye to be with the ""badboy""/boy band looking fella, which by now she should have learned does not work out.  What I really want to see is Fitz being in love with Simmons, but as Lincoln spends more time in the Shield base, he gets to hang out with Simmons more. They share interests as he is studying to become a doctor and she is a doctor, so they kind of fall in love with each other. This will create a situation that obviously should not be the center of any episode.  It will however make Fitz pull back from Simmons again (they will remain friends), seeking the companionship of Skye and Mack. Maybe Fitz and Skye will become an item, since he was always there for her and maybe she will see that he is the good guy that deserves the attention.   TLDR: I want to see Simmons and Lincoln in a relationship rather than Simmons and Fitz."

shield,3af2dn,i-like-tea,3,Sat Jun 20 19:05:53 2015 UTC,"Ward, to me, is the most likable character in the show. He has demonstrated time and time again that he is the most capable guy around. He's extremely dangerous and intelligent and he's always the most sensible.  Him going after the people that hurt him and Kara makes him a bad guy, but it's a very understandable motivation. He sets his sights on what he wants to do and goes through all the obstacles in his way in order to do it. But most importantly, he's never been annoying. He's never complained about secrets being hidden from him (like almost everyone else) and he's never let his emotions cause him to make a bad decision."

When I get to see a plot thread or character that was introduced in Agents of SHIELD play a role in any of the movies I'll believe that; it doesn't even have to be all that relevant in the story, a mere mention or cameo would suffice. As it is now, though, it seems the show takes the movies' scraps and use them to look like it's relevant in the greater MCU, like revealing Coulson to be the one who provides the Helicarrier that Fury takes to help the Avengers."

They're clearly playing Ward's family life as a mystery, so whatever happened there that messed up Grant Ward so much to become the murderer he is today has to be something  that's story worthy in a spy action show and not out of a soap opera like that stupid ""mommy loved my little brother more than me so I'm going to make her suffer by trying to kill my little bro"" explanation that Christian provided in ""The Things We Bury""."
shield,3adlss,macnbloo,12,Fri Jun 19 12:34:03 2015 UTC,"What's interesting is that when I watched that episode with his brother, I couldn't tell who was lying. Was grant just a psycopath or was his brother"
shield,3adlss,Demileto,9,Fri Jun 19 14:54:07 2015 UTC,"Yeah, and in all honesty I don't think we've seen the last of Christian, his death feels off to me in a number of ways from a narrative point of view:   he died off-screen, we only see a news report acknowledging that. No body, no death. Garrett says in the flashback scenes of ""Ragtag"" that Christian wanted Grant to be tried as an adult for arsoning and attempted murder, likely his, and present-day Christian's well aware of Grant's murder streak,  but then not only asks SHIELD not to pursue his little brother further on the premise that they're politically toxic but also was protected by a mere TWO security agents in ""The Things We Bury"". Seriously? Thomas, the younger brother, hasn't even been officially introduced or written off as dead and they already killed the older brother? Does not compute.   And then there's the fact that Whitehall's connection to the events of ""A Fractured House"" is so fragile - it comes down to the splinter bombs being made out of his research on Diviner Technology, neither he nor Bakshi ever acknowledge their hand in subsequent episodes - that the mastermind of the attack on the UN and SHIELD's safehouse could've easily been Christian Ward himself. And quite frankly it makes a lot more sense for Christian to the Big Bad here because Whitehall has never displayed any interest in a direct confrontation with SHIELD outside of this episode: his gist was always the research of alien biology and technology to find ways to weaponize them for HYDRA while this plot feels more like it came from a political strategist's mind. As such, how can I not think that Christian  will not only turn out to be alive but also the next enemy of SHIELD?"
shield,3adlss,PM_ME_YOUR_IRIS,6,Fri Jun 19 17:51:57 2015 UTC,Have you heard the theory that Lincoln is Thomas?
shield,3adlss,Demileto,3,Sat Jun 20 04:30:13 2015 UTC,"Have I heard? LOL, I made a whole blog post about it! That's why I say that we've yet to meet him officially! :P Seriously, the text limit on Reddit replies isn't enough to condense all my thoughts on the Wards, I think and rethink what could've happened and speculate what will come out of it in season 3 every single day and I just wish I could be in September already so I could see if half the things I theorized would be realized! :)  One example: the reveal in ""The Things We Bury"" that Grant, not Christian, was the one to push Thomas down the well and he did so because Christian ""put thoughts in his head, making him think they were his own"" never made much sense to me while I still thought of Christian as a human, because Grant's not dim-witted and he seems to be old enough in that scene to be through believing in Santa Claus let alone do Christian's bidding thinking it's his own. When I started thinking of Christian as already an INHUMAN - he does look to be around 15-16 in the Well scene, and that's about the age Gordon had when he transformed - thanks to the 'Lincoln is Thomas' theory, however, it made far more sinister sense, because that potentially means he has the power to CONTROL MINDS.   It'd probably be a power Christian could only use while touching people and takes a few seconds to work, mind you, explaining why he had to endure Grant's abuses in that episode - Grant would've pushed him away the very second Christian's hand touched his arm, for example - but by the very end he gets a window of opportunity - Christian putting his arm over Grant's shoulder is the very last shot we see of him - so he could very well have twisted Grant's plan of killing him and his parents for his own means. Worse,  if he really has that power can we even be sure anymore that Grant was the only proxy he used for his abuses? Could he have used his parents as well? That makes Christian far more dangerous than we've been led to believe so far, would definitely be interesting to see him as a Big Bad! :)"
shield,3adlss,Bookbringer,5,Sat Jun 20 11:22:20 2015 UTC,"It definitely felt like that, but on the rewatch, I felt like there were a lot of holes in Christian's story. First, he lies to Coulson about the Well, denying the incident entirely.  Then he lies again when he tells Ward he's meeting his wife.  Most tellingly, though is how cavalier he is about Ward's escape.  Not only does he cover it up so that no one but SHIELD is even looking for him, but he sneaks off to an isolated location with limited security, and is completely unworried as he plans a romantic weekend with his mistress.  I don't know about you, but if some twisted sadist who's been torturing people since he was a child (according to the screwdriver story and Christian's version of the Well) and who has already tried to murder me once (according to Christian's account of the fire) has escaped from prison with an extra decade of military training and combat skills... I'm not sneaking off to a cabin in the middle of nowhere where no one even knows to look for me -- I'm staying in a fortress surrounded by armed guards and starting a national manhunt, regardless of the potential embarrassment."
shield,3adlss,Demileto,2,Sat Jun 20 03:09:58 2015 UTC,"Not even SHIELD was looking for Grant when his little brother came for him in ""The Things We Bury"", May says he dismissed their help earlier in the episode while talking to Coulson, claiming SHIELD's politically toxic."
shield,3adlss,Bookbringer,2,Sat Jun 20 13:32:18 2015 UTC,"You're right -- in ""Things We Bury,"" Christian has told them to stay away because he has his own men looking for Grant.  But in ""Writing on the Wall,"" Coulson's says Christian's ""covering [Ward's escape] up"" and ""we're the only ones looking."" I was referring to that. Either way, it's pretty suspicious behavior given the alleged context."
shield,3adlss,Demileto,2,Sat Jun 20 14:09:33 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I remember, and wouldn't surprise me if he let SHIELD hunt Grant down for a while before calling them off so that they wouldn't suspect his true intentions. Either way, he's certainly up to something, no one gets to be a senator being this dumb."
shield,3adlss,Bookbringer,2,Sat Jun 20 14:40:07 2015 UTC,"Definitely. He's a serious player. Also, I think your point about the attack on the UN is scary logical. It would be just the excuse he needed to push through his anti-SHIELD legislation, giving himself basically carte blanche to kill whomever he chose to accuse."
shield,3adlss,Demileto,2,Sat Jun 20 14:44:26 2015 UTC,"Yup, and makes you wonder what he fears in Grant being in SHIELD's custody so much that he'd throw his plan away to get his brother out.  In fact, I'd even go so far as to say that if Marcus Scarlotti is part of Grant's new HYDRA then Christian's totally bankrolling his younger brother's plot and we can probably expect his team to backstab him later."
shield,3adlss,Bookbringer,2,Sat Jun 20 14:46:50 2015 UTC,"So you think Christian and Grant are working together? I don't. I'm still not convinced Christian's secretly alive, though in Whedon/Marvel anything's possible (and I know it's not Joss, but these Whedons have salvaged plenty of apparently dead characters -- Jiaying, Mike Peterson, Coulson).  My take is that Christian is a planner, but also an opportunist, and maybe even a little impulsive.  Maybe he scrapped the plan just because getting Grant back was more desirable to him -- maybe he really takes that much pleasure in hurting him. Or, he could've been afraid of Grant's stories being heard. Or maybe it was a Xanatos gambit - getting his legislation passed is one desirable outcome, but getting his brother back is another."

shield,3adlss,Demileto,1 point,Sun Jun 21 17:40:56 2015 UTC,"Well, they brought Jiaying back against all odds - she had her organs removed from her body by Whitehall - just so they could play the mother/daughter relationship with Skye last season, revealing Christian to be alive is a piece of cake by comparison. And honestly, I can't see them bringing Thomas into the story and keeping Christian out; Christian's abuses is Thomas's story as well, he'd have been denied closure with a definite death of his older brother.  As far as Grant and Christian working together, I think it's a pretty safe bet that should this ever happen it'd be unknown to Grant, he'd be an anonymous benefactor providing his little brother the manpower he needs to go against SHIELD."
shield,3adlss,Xetren,5,Sat Jun 20 15:18:52 2015 UTC,"It was proven that Ward was telling the truth in ""The Well"" in season one."

shield,3adlss,Bookbringer,2,Sun Jun 21 01:15:48 2015 UTC,"I agree and I think writing off the flashback as a delusion would feel like a copout, but the reason some posters (myself included) will argue that Ward's account of the Well is true is because the idea of it as a delusion has been repeatedly proposed by multiple viewers and some people are still adamant that Christian must be more reliable because Ward is obviously a bit unhinged.

Cash grab= collectors will buy all variant covers on a theme (same artist, character, series, whatever). The comic contents don't matter because they're buying for the cover. This sells lots of comics. Hooray for Marvel!  Advertising= I'm not interested in Guardians of Knowhere, but I like Agent May and may like her poster enough to buy the comic (but not enough to pay $50 for the art print.) Once I buy it, I might as well read the comic I now own, and I discover the story is interesting after all. The Guardians of Knowhere series now has a new comic-buying fan. Hooray for Marvel!"

Though, fine, this one has plenty to do with this SHIELD (that comic now on #7 is about the show characters).   And they make ""variant"" covers in general because they know they sell more copies of the same issue so it is a pretty brilliant marketing move in that way too. And because of the SHIELD variant shown here i bought a copy of Weirdworld which I would not have otherwise and it may turn out I love the series and want to continue reading it.

People aren't supposed to cross the walls/borders without Doom's permission; they're supposed to stay in their own little separate universe-islands.  So Secret Wars: Civil War will focus on a universe-island in which the Marvel Civil War never ended and has expanded to the whole country, not just superheroes.

The show is doing great and the only true relationships are Bobbi/Hunter (exes) May/Andrew (exes) Coulson/cellist (crush) Fitz/Simmons (crush, for now possibly) and Ward/Kara (I have no idea lol).  As most have seen with season 3 of Arrow, shoehorned romances are just pointless and ruin the show's traction."
shield,3acsql,Hawkguy67,9,Fri Jun 19 03:05:53 2015 UTC,"I don't think Coulson and the cellist are a crush, Weren't they dating? maybe more than dating? Definitely more than a crush. I could be wrong, haven't seen the Cellist episode in a bit."

shield,3acsql,Scorpion197,4,Fri Jun 19 14:59:07 2015 UTC,"Yes, I don't want any forced relationships for the sake of a relationship.  One of things I like about this show, is that there are relationships, but the show doesn't revolve around them. They are more of a side plot rather than full on focus."

Ward had just been shot by who he had been crushing on (he was rejected) and Kara just lost her purpose in life(she was brainwashed to do what Whitehall wanted her to do and now he was gone). Although, I wish there was more character development between them."

shield,3a9t9g,SkyscreamMxO,8,Thu Jun 18 13:28:45 2015 UTC,We could use every Dwayne Johnson puns we can find and mail it to her to convince her.
shield,3a9t9g,Arion_Miles,3,Thu Jun 18 18:58:14 2015 UTC,I dunno. I kinda feel like that's a tad disrespectful of the other attendees. And probably mightily confusing and impossible/awkward to explain in a panel question environment if she has no idea what reddit is.
shield,3a9t9g,SpinningDespina,0,Sat Jun 20 13:06:19 2015 UTC,"Disrepectful? It's a general admission Q&A with Elizabeth Henstridge. It's a question. She'll probably have an answer of some sort.   ""Elizabeth, would you consider visiting your fans at Reddit.com and responding to a few fan questions like Clark Gregg, Chloe Bennet, and J. August Richards did?""   Nothing impossible about that. Or awkward. Or confusing. The OP can ask or not ask. I would ask.  No guts ... no glory!"
shield,3a9t9g,SkyscreamMxO,3,Sat Jun 20 14:28:44 2015 UTC,"I'm trying to say this in a totally non-offensive way(I obviously have no vested interest in this, although I do see many panels). I would kinda put it on par with someone asking for a hug or a selfie during a panel. It's not going to enrich the show for the audience and can come across as a bit selfish(there is a set amount of time for questions and 95% of the audience aren't going to know what they're talking about and 99% will probably never see the AMA). I've seen people ask for an interview for their blog/webzine/fan club and it always awkward and unproductive. Always. Unless she is an avid redditor and gets what you mean. I can tell you the answer you'll get is a 'maybe'. Because she wont be able to say yes definitely for obvious reasons, but she will want to stay the nice guy on stage so she won't say no. I think it's a much better idea to ask a unique and thoughtful question that will enrich the panel for the majority of the audience. Save the AMA requests for social media etc."
shield,3a9t9g,SpinningDespina,1 point,Sat Jun 20 14:43:26 2015 UTC,"Not offended in the least. lol. I'm just really blunt. OP asked for ideas and that is the first question that popped into my head. I'm a guy that tends to speak his mind, for good or ill, and I would ask that. I disagree about a question like this being like a hug or a selfie. (I don't ask for hugs or selfies with celebs btw, so I'm guessing that the autograph session would be more appropriate for that?)  In my opinion, if she and other fans aren't aware of this place then it's a good opportunity to inform them of it. Wouldn't attendees at the panel be enriched by being aware of the 32,000+ fanbase here? I think so. So would we.  Never entered my head that a definite answer would be forthcoming. That would be an unlikely event. But if you don't plant the seed the Groot will never grow."
shield,3a9t9g,SkyscreamMxO,5,Sat Jun 20 15:18:31 2015 UTC,Can she do a Yorkshire accent? As a fellow Yorkshire lass I noticed she doesn't have much of one so I'm curious if she has ever had one/been able to do one? X

shield,3a9t9g,emma_pops,2,Fri Jun 19 22:59:42 2015 UTC,What does OTP mean?
shield,3a9t9g,catdoctor,2,Sat Jun 20 00:47:42 2015 UTC,"I had no idea what it meant when I first saw it either. Had to Google it. It's a fan term that stands for one true pair. Way I understand it is, when watching a show one can support multiple ships, but an OTP is the pair you believe are destined to be together. Thats my understanding anyway. There was also an interview Liz did where she was playing Mario kart with the interviewer and she was saying she hates it when Fitzsimmons don't get on."
shield,3a9t9g,emma_pops,2,Sat Jun 20 01:14:05 2015 UTC,"I have to agree, then. FitzSimmons are OTP. Thanks for the 'splaining."

shield,3a9t9g,emma_pops,2,Sat Jun 20 01:28:45 2015 UTC,"TL;DR means: ""Too long; didn't read."" The writers will make FitzSimmons happen at exactly the right time for maximum delight, then rip it away almost immediately, for maximum heartbreak. Just like they did in the last episode of Season 2."

The Monolith isn't at the bottom of the ocean because of Bobbi.  She lied, by omission, to Kara when she could have been upfront by apologising about selling her out for the greater good.  Things I like about Bobbi:  She's really tall.  She kicks ass occasionally.  She seems to actually care about Hunter even though she keeps stringing him along imo.  She's not afraid to speak her mind.  She seems to be loyal to the people she considers friends. Defending Skye when Gonzo called her a 'thing' for example. And other stuff."

This distinction between hypothesis and theory is mostly restricted to the hard sciences (some branches more than others). Other fields of study use it differently -- for example, sociology and literature both use theory to mean, more or less, a perspective or lens through which something is interpreted. In most contexts though, theory is used the way we're using it -- as a proposed explanation that isn't proven or tested, but has some sound arguments backing it up. That's by far the most common usage of the term, and I don't think it's incorrect just because that isn't how science uses the term.  I don't really want to start calling TV plot speculations hypotheses.  IMO, it seems silly to pretend we're discussing a hard science when we're not.

Coulson was dead too long and had a much nastier wound, plus he wasn't Inhuman, and Jaiying literally had to be pug back together so her wounds/scars were much worse than Skye's.

The Playground is a major base, perhaps the largest such base remaining to S.H.I.E.L.D. as of the activation of the Odyssey protocol, and would have at least better lab facilities and resources than the Bus (judging by the number of lab assistants present in the Playground's lab, and the quick construction of the modified Overkill device in 2.02), allowing Simmons to pick up traces of GH325 in the artist's body tissue whereas she couldn't in the Bus.

Just because you're at a high enough Clearance Level to gain access to some bit of information, it doesn't mean you automatically get to whenever you want. You have to have a ""need-to-know"" in addition. That ""need-to-know"" is validated by whoever is in charge of that bit of information.  So Cap being Level 8 doesn't mean he will be told or able to access all the information that Widow is told or able to access. I believe she explicitly told Cap in Winter Soldier ""You didn't have a need-to-know"". That's also why he wouldn't be made aware of TAHITI or the fact they used it to revive Coulson. Maria Hill and Nick Fury decided the Avengers didn't have a ""need-to-know"" and therefore they don't have access to that intel despite having the appropriate Clearance Level for it...."

I see a lot of people talking about ratings, but it's good to remember that the tv landscape has changed, and besides, didn't it have the top ratings at that time slot in the key demo recently anyway? The show is objectively successful and no network today would scrap a show with these ratings and gamble with a new one that might bomb spectacularly. They were even considering a spinoff.  I've also read stuff about ""audience creation"" and how studios now have to basically build an audience for a movie from scratch - one way to do this is a tie-in show. Basically, the more impetus there is to go see a movie on the opening weekend (e.g. an episode ties in with the movie), the more money studios make. The show also airs around the world, and with the Netflix deal, Marvel's television division might even be more profitable/yield more value per dollar invested.   tl;dr: I think we're safe."
shield,39sk9u,echoesintheattic,3,Sun Jun 14 23:25:01 2015 UTC,And the spinoff only stalled because the network was concerned about taking two heavy hitters (Nick Blood and Adrianne Palicki) from the main cast of Agents of SHIELD.
shield,39sk9u,jerslan,3,Tue Jun 16 21:25:36 2015 UTC,It depends I don't think a 4th season is a lock. If the ratings fall enough it can get cancelled because AoS costs way more to produce then shows like Nashville which got horrible ratings but is very cheap and the show runners have said the AoS was set up to have a 3 season anyway so if it does not get a fourth season its ok.
shield,39sk9u,SwagBelow,2,Sun Jun 14 15:22:32 2015 UTC,What source said the show runners only set AoS up for 3 seasons? I'd like a read of that. Do they say anything else?

shield,39sk9u,GrowMender,1 point,Sun Jun 14 22:02:13 2015 UTC,Just because it was a year ago does not mean they don't have the same plan. The Netflix shows are obviously doing there own thing so there won't be any crossovers with shield and AoS does not affect the movies its the other way around. They most likely have the same plan to go to 3 seasons. There was always a 3 season plan and just because the MCU is doing different things does not mean AoS would suddenly change there 3 season plan.
shield,39sk9u,SwagBelow,1 point,Sun Jun 14 22:54:56 2015 UTC,"I think he meant that because the movies affect the show, you can't plan too far in the future. Doesn't make sense to plan out 3 or 4 seasons in advance then have a movie do something crazy like infiltrate shield with Hydra and bring down the whole organization. Kinda ruins your plans.  So they can really only have set in stone plans a season out."
shield,39sk9u,BiggChicken,2,Mon Jun 15 09:51:44 2015 UTC,"You're assuming future movies will impact the show as much as Winter Soldier did. Maybe you shouldn't.  It's pretty clear by the way season 2 ended that they aren't going to write a season's storyline around a Marvel movie, they're doing their own thing. They used the whole ""Furry borrowed the Helicarrier from some friends to help the Avengers"" as a way to give anyone not called Skye something to do while the real story of the half-season, the Inhumans, was being built up in parallel with Skye as the lead. Expect a similar take to happen in season 3B."
shield,39sk9u,Demileto,2,Mon Jun 15 19:15:06 2015 UTC,That is what I am trying to explain. Just because things happen in the MCU they don't always impact AoS directly. You can tell that AoS is doing its own thing and the other movies and television shows are doing there own thing also but this person thinks things like Spider-Man coming to the MCU affect AoS and causes changes to AoS storylines when that is not the case. Big things in the MCU and most times AoS is not affected.
shield,39sk9u,SwagBelow,1 point,Mon Jun 15 21:27:01 2015 UTC,"I'm not assuming anything. That's the point. You're assuming none of the movies will affect AoS the was TWS did.  They may, they may not.

They plan 1 season at a time with a rough idea for the following.

shield,39sk9u,BiggChicken,4,Mon Jun 15 13:58:51 2015 UTC,That doesn't mean anything. It just means that whatever arcs they're on were planned out to three seasons at the time. It's really easy to flesh out current arcs and to even add new ones as the characters grow and mature on their own.
shield,39sk9u,GoldfishAvenger,0,Sun Jun 14 23:07:29 2015 UTC,I think it means a lot. AoS was always a show that was on the bubble and still is. Most likely they would want it to have a strong ending instead of giving the fans a season finale when they know they were not going to get a fourth season. So most likely the third season coming up will feel very final because this is what they were planning.
shield,39sk9u,SwagBelow,1 point,Sun Jun 14 23:16:51 2015 UTC,"I think you're ignoring all the moving parts that go into the MCU. When this panel happened, Spider Man wasn't in the MCU. We still don't know what's going on with Ridleys TV show. They had a planned spin off then opted not to. All these things can and will affect the show in some way. So they can have a rough idea of where they want to be in season 7. But they KNOW that things will change so they have to be very flexible."
shield,39sk9u,BiggChicken,1 point,Mon Jun 15 09:55:31 2015 UTC,I don't understand how other things like Spider-Man coming back affects AoS. He will never be on the show because the deal was for the movie and the john Ridleys show is serperate from AoS so how does it affect it. Why would Other things happening in the MCU affect AoS.That makes no sense because so far everything has been separate projects.
shield,39sk9u,SwagBelow,1 point,Mon Jun 15 11:12:08 2015 UTC,"First off. He won't ever be on the show but not because of the movie rights. Marvel already owns the TV rights to all of their characters. They can have Wolverine on AoS if they want.  But having his rights back in the movies will change some of the story arcs in the MCU.   We don't know how Spidey or Ridley's show will affect AoS or the movies or anything else. That's the point. The show runners don't know either. So they can't plan too far in advanced.   Yes they know about TWS. That was less than a year away. But they had no idea that Spidey would be in the MCU. So what if something big happens in the Spider Man movie. The show runners would have no way to predict that 3-4 years in advance.  So your whole idea that it ends after 3 seasons because that's all they have planned out is ridiculous.   If you can't see the flaw in your reasoning I can't help you. Just remember when they announce each new season, I told you so."
shield,39sk9u,BiggChicken,1 point,Mon Jun 15 13:55:12 2015 UTC,I am just trying to say that does not make any sense. The MCU has a bunch of different projects. They don't affect each other in many except for easter eggs and references.The show runners had AoS to have a 3 season arc. No matter the movies or television shows that come out it won't affect that over all plan. Spider-Man being in the MCU will affect the films not AoS. Your making it sound as if marvel got all there characters it would affect the show when that is not the case at all.What ever big change that affects the MCU does not affect AoS.Spider-Man coming back means nothing to the show.

It's been top in it's timeslot quite a few times. People tend to exaggerate how ""bad"" it's ratings are. Add ABC openly supporting the ratings for both this show and Agent Carter and it doesn't really seem likely to be in much danger. A second spin off was even being considered by ABC (and was not dropped due to worries over success). Common sense dictates that ABC wouldn't consider a full spinoff show and renew the first spinoff which had worse ratings iirc unless they were content with how the show was doing.  It's be like trying to say Arrow was doing awful for the CW right after they announce a second spinoff show. Clearly the network is ok with the show"

shield,39sk9u,Computing_Dunce,2,Mon Jun 15 01:59:46 2015 UTC,"I'd say that AoS is pretty much safe for the next couple of seasons unless the plot lines get very bad for some reason.  But it's secured for a couple of reasons; they've just introduced the Inhumans so that gives a min of a season to explore, the MCU is on a role and AoS benefits from tie ins with the films.  But mostly, it's gotten to the point where it's a good show."
shield,39sk9u,UmbrusNightshade,-1,Sun Jun 14 23:07:16 2015 UTC,"Only for the next season. It's gonna be iffy every season because ABC doesn't want to keep a show around that isn't pulling in the viewership. And honestly AoS could end after season 3 or it could be keeping the ball rolling to season 7, 8, 9, or 10. It's been a really iffy show since it debuted (I believe it kept pretty steady numbers in season 2 but, I believe that it had lower viewership over all compared to season 1). I'd say we can't ever feel ""safe"" about this particular show.  It's probably up to Disney ultimately because ABC and Marvel are both owned by them. It just depends on how much Disney feels that AoS is benefiting either ABC or Marvel or both."

(S1E6) had great cinematography, it looked like a movie - it gave me high expectations for the rest of the series, showing how good it could look at its best. IIRC it was the first episode where characters really cut loose and displayed a range of emotions, and was the first episode with a heavy Simmons focus. The escalation from everyday investigation to total disaster was so gradual and steady. And I genuinely had no idea what would happen. ""Surely they wouldn't kill a main character. Surely not. Not this early,"" was grappling with, ""But omg it's a Whedon show, maybe they would."" It was incredibly tense."

It's probably the lowest rated episode, but Ward and Kara were two of my favorite characters, and that episode revealed so much about both of their psyches. I wanted them to just run off and be happy together. I was so, so sad when Kara and Ward went full evil. Like, I know that kidnapping and torturing Bobbi was horrible and wrong, but.... Bitch, you had Kara kidnapped and tortured and forced to do God knows what while she worked for Hydra. The least you could do is admit that that had to be freaking awful for her!"

I'd presume that in the 100+ years of SSR/SHIELD/Whomever possessing the GooRock, it probably didn't eat anyone or show any signs of being aggressive.  But, it still was Mac's fault for being so poorly secured."
shield,39mck2,thevoicerises,22,Fri Jun 12 19:25:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah but they literally just had to stop inhumans from stealing it, so you'd imagine they'd keep it incredibly secure just to hinder future attempts."

shield,39mck2,Ubergopher,8,Tue Jun 16 00:03:04 2015 UTC,"Still, for something so unknown and potentially dangerous (IT MOVES ON ITS OWN FOR GODS SAKE) you would think an intelligence agency the scale of SHIELD would invest in some better locks. Like electromagnets for starters. Then maybe a pretty big latch like you would have for a cargo container. Certainly not a lock that's less secure than a bathroom stall door."
shield,39mck2,climbinguy,3,Sat Jun 13 01:57:00 2015 UTC,"I don't know if they ever saw it actually turn into liquid or not. Does anyone know if they did?

shield,39mck2,senses3,3,Sat Jun 13 12:02:48 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure they show it move the first time it's revealed to characters, and even if it isn't, it would be monitored when people aren't in the room, presumably."

shield,39mck2,DrakeXD,40,Sat Jun 13 05:31:44 2015 UTC,"Or possibly him leaning on it had nothing to do with it opening and the rock grabbing Simmons and that was only written in to make Fitz feel guilty when he finds out what happened. Maybe Killer Rock could have done that the whole time, but was waiting for the right person/moment."
shield,39mck2,acemerrill,14,Fri Jun 12 21:24:45 2015 UTC,"Yeah, this sounds very likely, especially when you factor in that Simmons digs the nails of her right hand into the floor, leaving desperate scratches as she's dragged screaming into the solidifying rock, but they inexplicably fade as the liquid rock swallows her. This show is usually very careful to avoid ambiguity in their special FX (eg. Trip crumbling) and never do anything they don't mean to do - perhaps this is proof that the rock has more power than just liquefying and solidifying."

shield,39mck2,StepMu,5,Sat Jun 13 06:29:58 2015 UTC,I have a theory the rock took her because of her previous anti-inhumans thoughts. I could be miles off though. She could've just looked tasty.
shield,39mck2,mechesh,10,Sat Jun 13 07:03:30 2015 UTC,That fits with my theory that the rock is going to turn her into someone powerful enough to kill inhumans.
shield,39mck2,Steve0512,3,Sat Jun 13 11:37:31 2015 UTC,"IMHO, I think the rock took her in order to communicate with her. And will release her unharmed. This will be the beginning of  a story arc. Since we don't know much about the stone. She will be able to give it a voice and tell its story. That and we get our major character back."
shield,39mck2,wheat_thin_lyfe,-1,Sat Jun 13 15:19:09 2015 UTC,probably just saw dat delicious posterior and gobbled her up.
shield,39mck2,Afalstein,3,Sat Jun 13 07:58:05 2015 UTC,SHIELD is actually pretty terrible when it comes to securing their artifacts (ref. The Fridge).  Perhaps a result of Hydra making them easier to steal.
shield,39mck2,leon__furious,2,Fri Jun 12 23:39:41 2015 UTC,... Fitz wasn't anywhere near the lock/latch/handle...
shield,39mck2,ic3manpw,2,Sat Jun 13 03:00:47 2015 UTC,Maybe something or someone wanted it open. maybe something cosmic. Perhaps the rock had some sort of influence on what was happening and effected the latching system. Idk

The UK is 3 weeks behind the US for the TV run, and companies that buy the rights to show it on air demand a certain amount of time as the sole providers of it in order to make their ads worth something. Since netflix UK won't give ABC as much money as TV syndication will, it becomes region locked to maximize profit.  Blame whichever company bought the rights to show it for letting there be a 3 week delay.  If you're really desperate you could get a US VPN and watch netflix through that (probably only worth it if you can then drop cable)."

shield,39kf2i,8eat-mesa,11,Fri Jun 12 10:07:47 2015 UTC,"She told Fitz that she was going to visit her family but in reality she was undercover in HYDRA. I think it's very likely that she did really visit her folks, in order to cement her cover story that she was no longer with S.H.I.E.L.D., but obviously she wasn't at home for as long as Fitz thought she was at home. And although I think Simmons could have handled the HYDRA-and-Fitz situation a little better, she lied to him with good intentions, and for his protection as well as hers, just as Fitz lied to protect Skye."
shield,39kf2i,-screamin-,7,Fri Jun 12 10:21:13 2015 UTC,"I think if Coulson had just said to Fitz: ""Simmons is on a mission,i can't tell you where"" straight away a lot of their issues wouldn't have happened.  Though i suppose he would still have been pissed she accepted the assignment...."
shield,39kf2i,Scorpion197,3,Fri Jun 12 11:44:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah totally. It bums me out how Coulson seemed detached from Fitz during that time.   Ugh it breaks my heart to think about what Fitz went through before season 2 started-- like, Jemma told him she was going to visit her parents, presumably for a week or two, and left, and he's sitting there thinking she'll be back soon.   But then a week or two passes, and she's still gone. He can't get in touch with her, and he hasn't heard from her-- probably the longest they've ever gone without speaking in a decade. And NO ONE will tell him why she's not back yet. He probably asked-- or maybe he didn't. Maybe he had a sinking realization that she had just left, that she wasn't coming back, and didn't want confirmation of it. There's that one episode with Donnie where he snappishly says something like ""Maybe someone could ask Jemma if they knew how to reach her,"" so he knows it's being kept from him.   I love Jemma and think she did what she had to do, and that she was hurting just as much, but ugh, it's just painful to think about Fitz's slow dawning realization that she had lied to him and wasn't necessarily coming back."

Although most Final Fantasy games (with the exception of a few sequels / prequels / spinoffs) feature different characters in different situations in different time periods and different universes they all share certain things that connect them. The Spirits Within barely had anything related to the game series at all - A character called Cid (always a different person though) often related to airships / engineering has been in every game since the third entry (iirc) and they even fucked that up in the film by spelling the characters name 'Sid' in the film.  There are several animals that appear in almost every game that aren't in the film -Chocobos (big birds that are the horses of the games), Cactuars (monsters that look like cacti), Moogles (The pink fairy like creatures), Tonberry, Behemoth etc. etc.   Magic is always a part of the games, even the ones with futuristic settings but there is no magic in the film, or summoning.   Crystals are often the source of magic and power within the games and are a huge part of the overall plot - not always but it's a common theme.  Anyway I liked the film but it's not in any way a Final Fantasy film except in name."

Maybe the original shoot only had a specific actor for 30 minutes, and of the 200 photos shot, only 100 are usable for print because of blinking eyes, odd poses, etc. Of those 100, the talent will approve 50 and from there your boss will approve 10 of those shots. Of those 10, you figure 3 of them seem to match closest with the other talents' approved photos, but not especially well. There's no way a reshoot is happening 'cause the actor is halfway around the world doing press plus the shoot would cost another several thousand to set up. You can then retouch what you have for lighting and tone, and go through 2 rounds of intense touchups but the end result is still this.

shield,39bndp,kwh,1 point,Thu Jun 11 03:55:39 2015 UTC,"I agree it's significant, but Star Wars effectively grew out of a script by one man (Lucas), with the torch passed to many others. MCU is the final mining of 75+ years of pop culture, modern myths, by hundreds of artists and authors. It's very akin to Disney (in the 50s) originally mining the folk and fairy tales of the 15-1700s. So far Feige, etc. have been successful at doing it in a way that keeps some integrity and links together in a way that audiences find compelling enough to explore the whole universe. They could screw it up, time will tell."
shield,39bndp,TheHandyman1,1 point,Thu Jun 11 14:25:19 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure if you're agreeing or disagreeing with me fellow Hunter fan, but I pretty much meant cultural significance, not so much source material."
shield,39bndp,kwh,1 point,Thu Jun 11 14:28:07 2015 UTC,"It's something which has been on my mind before, and that's the difference I see between the two. Star Wars is an original universe which proceeds almost entirely out of Lucas' ""Journal of the Whills"" script and evolved over about 35 years, MCU is being assembled from themes and characters arising out of 75+ years of pulp. Not saying one is better or worse.  I can't really say if seeing the MCU realized on-screen has the same psych-effect on the generation coming of age, as SW had on those coming of age in the late 70s and early 80s.  SW was primarily significant because of ILM special effects - it was a novel story but would have fallen flat as much other sci-fi did if the FX were not groundbreaking and jawdropping for their time.  I would also say that different themes predominate - SW was about the Joseph Campbell ""hero cycle"", individual coming of age, coping with the word, integrating and fulfilling destiny. Most of the MCU works deal with teamwork and diverse individuals coming together, working on goals in spite of intense conflict, and flawed personalities finding the motivation to become heroic - make of that what you will."

Now I know the show will most likely be deeply invested in its own Season 3 story by that point, but at the same time I think the show has done a spectacular job of tying into the movies while still being its own thing. I know people complain about ""how come TV characters don't pop up in the movies"" but I'm not bothered by that at all, as I feel each MCU entity should be its own thing. It's the 'little connections' that bridge the MCU, such as Phase 1 Coulson, or Sitwell popping up on AoS right before Winter Soldier, or Doctor List showing up on AoS right before Age of Ultron. I thought the way those were handled were incredible, and people might tell you otherwise but the show really does affect the movies. Production-wise it doesn't, but the show does a tremendous job or working around that and it really does affect how you see the movies. Remember how hype S2E19 was?"

Sean Bean... So he can add to the Sean Bean death reel. Maybe have him as a SHIELD soldier or in the posse of a bad-guy-of-the-week/season, and then he gets killed randomly in a fairly gruesome way.  Amanda Tapping as Fitz's Mom.  Joe Flanigan as an old mercenary/army buddy of Hunter and Bobbi (maybe even Bobbi's old flame).  David Hewlett as Simmons Dad....

His films have grossed more than $3 billion from 42 releases worldwide.  He has received an Academy Award, a Golden Globe, two BAFTAs and three Screen Actors Guild Awards, as well as the Volpi Cup. His most notable and acclaimed role to date has been his 2010 portrayal of King George VI in The King's Speech, a performance that earned him the Oscar and multiple worldwide best actor awards.  Identified in the late 1980s with the ""Brit Pack"" of rising, young British actors, it was not until Firth's portrayal of Mr. Darcy in the 1995 television adaptation of Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice that he received more widespread attention. This led to roles in films such as The English Patient, Bridget Jones's Diary (for which he was nominated for a BAFTA), Shakespeare in Love and Love Actually. In 2009 he received widespread critical acclaim for his leading role in A Single Man, for which Firth gained his first Academy Award nomination, and won a BAFTA Award.  In 2011, Firth received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame and was also selected as one of the Time 100.  He was awarded an honorary degree from the University of Winchester in 2007, and was made a Freeman of the City of London in 2012.

In all honesty  i think AoS needs to stay away from the Netflix shows. They are way too different and crossovers would feel unnatural.
shield,39a6hk,Delvoire,4,Wed Jun 10 13:37:35 2015 UTC,"Given how Zola's algorithm managed to pick out a lot of people that were only ever identified as potential future threats it is possible that with such surveillance techniques that Hydra/Shield could work out that Matt is ""enhanced"" beyond some levels of human performance.

If the algorithm is pervasive enough it could have picked up any and all activity from his life post accident and highlighted the discrepancies. The data may still exist."
shield,39a6hk,SicTim,2,Wed Jun 10 14:21:45 2015 UTC,The data was destroyed in Winter Solider though and even if it was not it would not be Shields possession all they have is the index which has a handful of people and Daredevil is not one of them.

I think shield is at the point where they don't care about people like Daredevil and the other vigilantes if they are just helping people with there powers. Think about it every one that has been on the index  has been evil except for Skye.

Part of the point of the finale was that Mack needed Skye's help to hack something. Skye didn't save the day by shooting people, or blasting them with shockwaves - Skye saved the day by being the person she made herself to be. Not a SHIELD Agent, or an Inhuman, but a hacker - using skills she taught herself. Skye's arc was about trying to find out who she is - who her parents were, where they came from - and in the end realizing that it didn't matter - she is Skye."

shield,398mll,Demileto,4,Wed Jun 10 21:01:51 2015 UTC,It would be very fucking stupid if he turned out to be Punisher anyway.
shield,398mll,TheDalekCaan,5,Thu Jun 11 02:27:40 2015 UTC,It would be so stupid. I hate how everyone wants Ward to be characters like Punisher and Taskmaster. I mean Ward is interesting but no where near interesting as these established characters. Ward does not need to be anyone from the comic just himself.
shield,398mll,AStrangerWCandy,-1,Thu Jun 11 02:45:23 2015 UTC,"People say this, but I can name 5-6 places AoS has gone that are way darker than anything on Daredevil."
shield,398mll,AStrangerWCandy,9,Thu Jun 11 01:40:17 2015 UTC,That is not true and you know it. Daredevil is the darkest thing Marvel has done and if you think so name those times when AoS has been darker.
shield,398mll,TheDalekCaan,-4,Thu Jun 11 01:46:00 2015 UTC,"Uhhh in Season 2 it most definitely has had several moments darker than anything on Daredevil mostly dealing with Ward. Ward torturing his brother and then burning him and his parents. Whitehall vivisecting Jiayang and then dumping her corpse. The entire episode of Love in the Time of Hydra. May shooting a small child. Ward torturing Bobbi, then breaking her legs when she tries to escape. Jiayang trying to kill her own daughter."
shield,398mll,TheDalekCaan,6,Thu Jun 11 01:52:16 2015 UTC,"1.Ward ""torturing"" his brother was barely torture just forcing his brother to admit his faults and make him feel better and burning him and him parents were not even shown and they deserved it.   Whitehall  vivisecting Jiayang was no where near bloody as the stuff going on in Daredevil like a man loosing his Head.They barely showed it and all you saw was blood on rags . Love in the Time of Hydra was just brainwashing some hydra guy and Ward being creepy. It was not dark just creepy . May did shoot a child but for a good reason but they did not even show a corpse and Daredevil had innocent old woman die for no reason except for wanted to live at her house.   Ward torturing Bobbi was not dark because she is a Shield agent and could take it and not a civilian like Claire who was also tortured and had to live with that.   Jiayang trying to Kill Skye is not dark because in the end we knew it was coming since she killed Rania.   Daredevil's dark moments were shown and not implied like Shield's they only pushed it to network televisions standards."
shield,398mll,AStrangerWCandy,6,Thu Jun 11 02:25:35 2015 UTC,"Daredevil had a guy have his head get blown off by a car door. It had a guy suicide by headbutting a spike. Another guy having his head torn apart by a bowling ball.  Sorry, but AoS ain't got nothin' on Daredevil in terms of darkness."
shield,398mll,OhEightFour,3,Thu Jun 11 02:32:57 2015 UTC,Yeah I was trying to explain that but this person thinks AoS is darker then Daredevil. They are no where near close in levels of darkness. Daredevil is the darkest thing in the MCU and that is not even up for debate.
shield,398mll,AStrangerWCandy,3,Thu Jun 11 02:37:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah, dude has a really short memory. Hell, Daredevil tortured dudes himself all the time."
shield,398mll,OhEightFour,0,Thu Jun 11 02:39:58 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry but removing people's body parts piece by piece while they are still alive and then dumping is definitely worse than the stuff going on in Daredevil. Pretty much the worst thing there was Kingpin smashing a dude's skull in with a car door.  You seem to be conflating gory with dark. Dark is a tone. As an example Kick-Ass is gory, but not dark. Kyle Machlachlan describing his history and what Whitehall did to his family and then switching to a happy go lucky guy who intends to go murder every human in the building besides his daughter is dark. You don't have to actually see it."
shield,398mll,AStrangerWCandy,3,Thu Jun 11 03:02:52 2015 UTC,"Yeah but he did not do it.It was just empty threats.The Kingpin actually did dark stuff like  blowing a  building with innocent people inside to frame one man and was intense when he killed his father with a hammer at the age of 12.When Cal used to switch to   Happy go lucky it stopped being dark and more of a joke. People on this subreddit stopped taking him seriously after a while and say his catchphrases like ""Best Day Ever""   he probably started dark but became a joke."
shield,398mll,Tenacious_G,3,Thu Jun 11 03:13:20 2015 UTC,"Dark and gory are not the same thing, but they are also not mutually exclusive; Daredevil does happen to be much gorier than SHIELD, but also much, much darker, both in visual and thematic tone. Almost undeniably so, which makes it strange that you are denying it."
shield,398mll,snarkamedes,0,Thu Jun 11 16:08:27 2015 UTC,"Maybe because I'm actually evaluating what is actually happening, implied or on screen rather than relying on simple visual cues. I find many of the events on AoS to be more fucked up than Daredevil when I stop and think about it."
shield,398mll,meme-com-poop,1 point,Thu Jun 11 17:23:55 2015 UTC,"You yourself said that ""darkness"" is a tone; that means it has very little to do with what is said/shown/implied, but HOW it is said/shown/implied.   Borrowing your previous example, we both agree Kick-Ass was not a dark movie tonally. But a man is lit on fire in front of his daughter! On top of that, it is implied he raised her to be a murderer from a young age! These are dark things!  That's true, but it doesn't make the movie dark, no more than Jiaying's vivisection or Fisk's patricide makes their respective shows ""dark"" on their own. Tone is all in HOW it's presented, and while Daredevil almost unanimously falls in the loose category of ""dark and gritty"", I don't know many who would agree that Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. is tonally dark at all (even though the general consensus is that the second season is considerably more serious and fast-paced)."
shield,398mll,Bookbringer,0,Thu Jun 11 21:54:49 2015 UTC,"I didn't say the show itself was darker. I said it goes to darker places. Meaning that the darkest of the dark on AoS were darker IMO than the equivalent on Daredevil.

shield,398mll,UmbrusNightshade,12,Wed Jun 10 01:22:40 2015 UTC,It makes more sense for him to be in Daredevil then in AoS. Shield list can maybe pick from is the heroes that have to do with Shield like Quasar and the other secret warriors.

This show has always been about minor characters like daisy and Deathlok, and Mockingbird.AoS has always prided themselves by making characters up like Gordon or Rania. It is a good thing and allows AoS to do its own thing."

They lure you into a sense of comfortability and set strong ""shipper"" vibes, then kill of the person that everyone seems to love. I have a strong feeling that one of those will die this next season. The show is starting to get a bit crowded (since Hunter and Morse won't be getting their spin-off) and a good way to ""clear room"" is to kill off people."

She has humiliated Ward in two consecutive season finales and denied him the object of his affection in those instances as well.  Ward is not going to let her find happiness.

shield,398mll,Chaffro,1 point,Fri Jun 12 03:01:10 2015 UTC,"Could be. I think that Ward may actually die. Here's what I see go down:  Maybe Ward kills May's ex, maybe not. Either way, in the finale Ward and May fight. May is killed (just barely loses). Later in the finale, Jemma kills Ward (she did make that promise to him and I wouldn't be surprised to see the Whedons go through with it before and IF they decide to kill her off.  I do agree that Lincoln could die and something will definitely keep Fitz and Simmons apart."
shield,398mll,meme-com-poop,1 point,Fri Jun 12 05:32:55 2015 UTC,I'm thinking Ward may just torture May into believing she is agent 33 or something like that. That's what I thought after seeing the number 33 on the locker in the season finale. But who knows...

shield,398mll,OhEightFour,6,Wed Jun 10 04:29:21 2015 UTC,I would not really classify sif as a superhero because she is not really one she is more of an Asgardian citizen and I think the question is who can the show introduce like in the same way Daredevil is the first show to introduce Punisher at least til he gets his own show.
shield,398mll,OhEightFour,1 point,Wed Jun 10 04:43:36 2015 UTC,"Deathlok never related to SHIELD and he was used here; your point, thus, doesn't apply all that well. The better parameter would be: does this hero have potential to headline a movie or TV series, or, alternatively, is there any other movie and/or TV series where his or her introduction would fit better? If the answer to one of these questions is yes, then Agents of SHIELD likely can't use him or her, at least before the official introduction. After that it really comes down to a) how prestigious the character and/or the actor/actress are and b) the value he/she brings to the show's story."

If Ward is faux-redeemed via memory-loss, it will probably be caused by a lab accident that also gives him super powers.  Personally, I think he's likely to ""die"" at the end of either 3a or 3b, either by getting A. a taste of his own medicine (a traitor on his team treats him like he treated the the others), B. hoisted by his own petard (he gets caught in his own cruel trap), or C., he sacrifices himself for someone he cares about (Thomas? A new member of team bad guy?). Bonus points if fire is involved for poetic irony.  Afterwards, however, it will be revealed that he survived in a way that leaves him with superpowers. Maybe there was a crystal in the room and the terrigenesis cocoon protected him, or maybe he fused with some kind of mystic artifact like the berserker staff.  Regarding Kara33... I have a theory as to how she's still alive, but it's not very likely."

There was an article on it recently that pretty much sums it up.  AoS is a hell of a show and definitely fits the bill as the MCU's backbone as far as I'm concerned, although so far the film tie-ins have left a lot to be desired.  I really hope it gets more recognition as it develops further, and more actors from the films agree / are perusaded to appear at least once in order to give the show that extra little bit of validation.  It goes without saying how awesome Daredevil is, and I really hope that at some point we see a crossover between it and AoS.  I'd also like to see either one or both shows help set up Spider-Man in some way, just as AoS is doing now with Inhumans."

shield,393aig,dreamycreamy93,3,Tue Jun 9 12:20:28 2015 UTC,One of the few shows I didn't have to binge watch.   I binge watched the Walking Dead to see the 5th season finale.   I binge watched Arrow to watch season two.   I binge watched Turn. Now I'm falling behind on season two.

shield,393aig,8eat-mesa,1 point,Tue Jun 9 08:17:39 2015 UTC,"I binged watched pretty much the first season, just before the second one was about to air. And while I did go into it straight after Capt 2 (mostly to see if there would be any black widow cameos I was so hopefully naive ), It was amazing seeing the characters grow, and their relationships with each other change. Thankfully with Binge-watching, if you do it right, you can avoid all of the spoilers, which I did, so the twist was amazing.    Now I've binge watched the series a couple of times in full, and I have to say, it's amazing to look at the differences in the characters, and pick up on all the subtilises hinted throughout the seasons (not only with the whole ward thing, but with May, and Simmons and Fitz and the whole team really.) But you can definitely pick up on so much more of the characters that aren't always in the spotlight, and it's really great, so if you have time this summer, I definitely suggest binging it, even if you have seen it before."

With the addition of her superpower, this should be an epic fight scene.  Not sure if Ward would be able to survive so it might be his 'end game'.  In the meantime, it would be fun to see him take out some low-level S.H.I.E.L.D. agents."

I get that he sorta did that with bobbi but if he were to take out MAY it would truly make him worth watching and really it would make sense for may since she kind of seems to be the odd person out with all the new things shield will have going on. Do that and make Ward your big bad have him recruit bastard inhumans and you'll have an epic season 3.

shield,3943t0,Bookbringer,3,Wed Jun 10 13:45:20 2015 UTC,"Seriously. I want to see that Ward's years of training with SHIELD and HYDRA mean he is still the killer we are introduced too. We get shades of it in his fight vs Bobbi but I think he could be at his best channeling his inner Matt Damon/Jason Bourne like this:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLt7lXDCHQ0  Imagine something like that vs Hunter or maybe one of Skye's unsuspecting Caterpillars, thinking because they are powered they can take some neo-HYDRA at night, or after they get jacked up the helmet comes off and its Ward."
shield,3943t0,DBHT14,7,Fri Jun 12 02:01:15 2015 UTC,"Ward needs more fight scenes where he fights a woman, lands some punches (or whatever), but then gets his ass handed to him. I love seeing the women of AoS beat the crap out of him."

shield,3943t0,Bookbringer,-7,Tue Jun 9 13:19:35 2015 UTC,Nah. He's a bastard. He deserves to get his ass kicked. And the fact that women beat him just makes it better because it emasculates him. I can see him win some guy vs. guy fights though.
shield,3943t0,UmbrusNightshade,13,Tue Jun 9 22:14:28 2015 UTC,"Um, one of the things I love about AoS is the totally unsexist way they play their action girls -- by not playing the, ""you got beat by a girl"" angle. There's never the implication that being beaten by women is emasculating, which is good because that's actually pretty sexist. Plus, it's kind of ridiculous, given that the women of AoS are a force to be reckoned with -- May, Bobbi, and Skye are the team's toughest fighters right now.  Ward, to his credit, has never seemed to mind getting his ass handed to him by women more than men. He's pretty frank about May being his biggest threat and a better fighter, and never hints at feeling emasculated or threatened by her asskickings. Just because he's tough and evil, doesn't mean he has to be sexist too."
shield,3943t0,Bookbringer,2,Tue Jun 9 23:04:27 2015 UTC,The Marvel Universe Is filled with Bad-ass women and TV shows should be no different and I think no character in the MCU has really been portrayed as sexist so I don't think Ward deserves credit for that. I mean Black Widow was the best student in Shield Academy and an Avenger. So no man can really say anything bad about women in the MCU.
shield,3943t0,Bookbringer,3,Wed Jun 10 00:58:48 2015 UTC,"Some of the bad guys seem sexist - Garrett obviously had issues with Victoria Hand, that corrupt Italian cop was pretty sexist to May. And dear Fitz figured Skye had distracted Quinn with her boobs.  My point wasn't to imply Ward deserves ""credit"" for the basic decency of not being sexist, as much as acknowledgement that he doesn't have this particular flaw.  He has enough real flaws -- he doesn't need to get censured for a flaw he doesn't have."
shield,3943t0,ExcaliburZSH,3,Wed Jun 10 02:44:05 2015 UTC,"Well, Garrett was a jerk...and he shot Hand, so that could be more about Hand being a Jerk boss and loyal Shield Agent. I think Garrett would be a Jerk to Adama, I mean Gonzales as well. Authority problem of gender issue.   Yeah, the cop was bad. Easy way to make you like not like a character is make them an ass to one of the good characters.   Skye's breasts were a bit out there in season one.  The writers do deserve points for being consistent about the Ward character. From the beginning he was about the mission and what are advantages and drawbacks. They didn't add sexism to give him a flaw but reinforced his professionalism and intelligence. They let being crazy be his flaw. Also points for dropping the ""I Love Skye"" angle after she shot him."
shield,3943t0,UmbrusNightshade,-5,Wed Jun 10 04:16:22 2015 UTC,"Okay, that may be so but in Real Life, whether or not it's actually the way it should be, when a man is beaten by a woman society as a whole (especially other men) see that individual in a lesser view. I'm not saying that the show should go that route, but as a man I can tell you from first hand experience myself and by being around other males that having a female best a male is (at least in all the areas I've lived in) a ""negative thing""; social mores don't change just because people want them to ... at least not in the snap of a finger.   May is not a better fighter. They are equal. May has speed but he has strength. And I'd say it's about the same with Bobbi. The winner is decided more on circumstances and environment rather than one being ""better"" than the other. And without her powers Skye would lose to him.   And I'm not being sexist. There is a true difference between men and women and, generally from a biological perspective, men are stronger. Therefore, a man being beaten (literally) by a woman has negative social connotations. I fully respect women, but I do NOT feel that women and mean are ""identical"" in all things. There are things that women tend to be better than men at and things that men tend to better than women at. It's biology. There is no such thing as ""true"" equality as men and women are biologically different in so many aspects. There is ""synthetic"" equality, which means that one treats women and men with same amount of respect and dignity while accepting the inherent differences between the two. Anyone who thinks that men and women can be 100% ""equal"" in every way is wrong. If that were the case there would be no gender, no sex designation. We would all be homogenous and unisex."
shield,3943t0,Bookbringer,3,Tue Jun 9 23:20:05 2015 UTC,"Ok... 90% of that was you projecting gender role issues onto my post that I didn't bring up or imply, so I'm going to ignore that part.   In-universe, May and Bobbi and Skye are forces to be reckoned with, and therefore there is nothing embarrassing or emasculating about being defeated by them. At no point is this implied to be the case in the story or thought by any characters involved. Being beaten up by a civilian like Mrs. Talbot might dent some men's egos (whether it makes them doubt their manliness or just their skills as an agent is likely to vary from man to man).  Example: Bob can get beaten and think, ""Manly men are supposed to be better fighters than women. I lost to a woman. Therefore, I am not a very manly man."". Or he can think, "" I am supposed to be a better fighter than civilians. I lost to a civilian. Therefore, I am not a good agent. "". Or he can not feel embarrassed or emasculated at all by thinking, "" I am an amazing fighter. Mrs. Talbot beat me. Therefore, Mrs. Talbot is a tough old broad.""  Ward seems to think more along the lines of the last example.  He has never indicated feeling ashamed, embarrassed, or emasculated after losing a fight, regardless of whom he lost it too. Very likely, Ward is secure in his sexuality and doesn't view his fighting prowess as a measure of his self-worth or masculinity.  Based on his past reaction to losing, I don't think any loss would make him feel embarrassed or emasculated. Honestly, I think he could get his ass handed to him by a little girl in a pink dress and react by thinking, ""I am indisputably awesome. This little girl beat me. Therefore, she is an asset / threat I must find a way to exploit/ acquire/ neutralize. Man, I look fabulous with a beard.""   May is not a better fighter. They are equal. May has speed but he has strength. And I'd say it's about the same with Bobbi. The winner is decided more on circumstances and environment rather than one being ""better"" than the other. And without her powers Skye would lose to him.    Skye, I'll grant you. Sans powers, Skye would get her ass kicked by Ward.  Sans powers, Steve Rogers would also get his ass kicked by Ward, so I don't think it proves much. May beat Ward both times they fought, so the general consensus on this sub is that she's better.   Admittedly the cybertek battle is debatable, since both were recovering from injuries (his were probably worse) and she may have had some residual strength from handling the berserker staff. The ""Yes Men"" fight had both at their best, though -- unless he had secret injuries from being an Agardian's sex toy (probably not, but Lorelei does have super strength and an obvious contempt for the wellbeing of others.) So May is debatable, but barely. Bobbi is where I call bullshit. You say the circumstances matter. Agreed. Bobbi was beaten, drugged, and tortured and she was still cleaning the floor with Ward, who was at his best. She had him on the ropes the whole time. Every single move of his was a defensive one, and at no point does he even get to touch the upper hand. Only when Kara and he tagteamed her did they get to take her out."
shield,3943t0,Xetren,1 point,Wed Jun 10 02:28:53 2015 UTC,"May is a better fighter than Ward. This has been proven when he got his ass handed to him by may, and fractured his throat or something. As for Skye, I'd like to think they would be even in fighting skills, but i could be wrong. After all Ward has never pulled off the gun fu Skye did, not to mention she didn't use her powers during that. Again i could be wrong, we haven't had enough fight scenes between the characters to effectively determine whose better.  Edit: Ward didn't do the fancy gun fu, but he did take on multiple soldiers at once before."
shield,3943t0,UmbrusNightshade,2,Wed Jun 10 23:04:59 2015 UTC,"Still gonna say that Ward and May are equal. It all comes down to the circumstances of the fight, the environment, and other factors as to which would win. And there is no way Skye is equal with him without her powers. He's had years of training where she's had a year or less."
shield,3943t0,Bookbringer,1 point,Thu Jun 11 01:37:43 2015 UTC,"Most of the SHIELD/ HYDRA agents Skye has taken on have also had years of training, and she still kicks their asses, so that's not an ironclad argument. Why single out superpowers to be removed from the equation? I don't understand the relevance of arguing what powered characters might fight like without their powers. We could just as easily discuss what Ward would fight like without his training or without his strength -- not very well -- but I'd rather take the characters as they are. Skye has powers. Steve Rogers without his serum, Bruce Banner without the Hulk, and Iron Man without his suit would all be tiny little pieces of dead mincemeat after a round with Ward. So, Idk, what your argument about a depowered Skye is even supposed to prove. Skye may still have a psych-warfare advantage over Ward, and may win by exploiting his feelings for/ towards her."
shield,3943t0,UmbrusNightshade,1 point,Thu Jun 11 02:55:54 2015 UTC,"Can't recall her fighting S.H.I.E.L.D. agents (other than maybe Hydra double agents). Also before she got her powers she wasn't that good of a fighter at all.  Because her powers are an issue that came after her initial entry into S.H.I.E.L.D. Ward had his training when they first met. Without her powers she's not that great of a fighter (but getting better all the time).  I contend that Steve could be equal with her. He's the type of guy who would have worked hard to become what others told he couldn't ... even without the serum. And just because you're small doesn't mean you can't become an effective fighter. I'll give you this one (though after the end of Season 2 I'd say that Ward doesn't give a shit anymore and just wants revenge on S.H.I.E.L.D. [particularly May and ""Bobbi""])"
shield,3943t0,Xetren,2,Thu Jun 11 03:03:47 2015 UTC,"On #1, did you miss a few episodes or something? Skye VS 33 although Skye lost that fight she showed great fighting skills (she disarmed 33 and caught the gun afterwards). I'd say that takes some serious skittles."
shield,3943t0,Xetren,1 point,Fri Jun 12 11:11:01 2015 UTC,"Meh, we still have yet to see ward pull off some amazing feats. If we go by what we have seen thus far, Skye has shown more combat skills than ward. And yes, I know it's incredibly unrealistic for Skye to have this level of skill after just a year of training. But you may be right, as we don't know what Ward had pulled off off screen. So if we are being realistic here, then yes ward would beat without her powers.  Powers OP."
shield,3943t0,UmbrusNightshade,1 point,Thu Jun 11 04:00:36 2015 UTC,Thanks for accepting where I'm coming from with it. I see the point that she does have powers and that factors in. With them she does win. Without I just think it's a bit more fair and it'd either be him winning (which I think is the more likely scenario) or them being about equal.
shield,3943t0,Bookbringer,1 point,Thu Jun 11 20:43:42 2015 UTC,"Skye didn't visibly use her vibration powers, but, in the comics, Inhumans have a slight speed/ health/ strength/ etc... advantage, and she may have been using her powers to sense vibrations. Personally, I prefer this explanation for her skills -- better than saying a year of training makes her superior to most SHIELD/HYDRA agents, even though they're also highly trained."
shield,3943t0,Xetren,1 point,Thu Jun 11 02:38:55 2015 UTC,"Those solders she killed weren't highly trained. As of right now May, Ward, Bobbi, and Skye are the only specialist we know of. Those solders are trained how to shoot a gun, not trained to kick ass. Think of a military soldier for example, they aren't trained fight like the specialists are.  Feel free to point out any specialists I may have missed."
shield,3943t0,NanoGeek,5,Thu Jun 11 03:54:14 2015 UTC,I'm just sad that we didn't get another May v. Ward beatdown during season 2's finale. I guess Ward knew what was coming and went for sneaky sneaky instead.
shield,3943t0,UmbrusNightshade,3,Tue Jun 9 14:09:07 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but ""Bobbi"" did give him quite a fight. Probably would have beat his ass completely if it hadn't have been for Kara being there too."
shield,3943t0,ExcaliburZSH,1 point,Tue Jun 9 22:13:20 2015 UTC,May vs 33 was better.
shield,3943t0,louhikaarme,-1,Wed Jun 10 04:16:46 2015 UTC,"I agree. :) Especially I'd like to see Jemma wipe the floor with him. Not likely to happen, but that would give me satisfaction.   And maybe it could happen, if she gains some powers inside of the hungry hungry hunk of stone - whether by it changing her physiologically or monolith being a portal in space/time  - she would be away for two minutes in real time but five years of her personal time and has learned some serious martial arts where ever she was. :)"
shield,3943t0,Bookbringer,7,Tue Jun 9 10:23:15 2015 UTC,"Personally, I don't want to see Jemma become an action girl. They have 3 already (not including guests like Lady Sif) and they are the best fighters in the show. While I like to see the show being smart about self-defense, I don't want all the characters to become warriors. Jemma's weapon is her mind.  Edit: Lady Sif, not Sir (damn autocorrect)."
shield,3943t0,jlynne1985,3,Tue Jun 9 13:24:26 2015 UTC,I agree.  I want Jemma and Fitz to stay nerdy.  They can fight to defend themselves and their team every once in a while but not on a daily basis like the rest of the team.
shield,3943t0,Addy6,2,Tue Jun 9 14:21:04 2015 UTC,Jemma's weapon is her mind   Totally agree. I feel like its really important this is retained. Its also why I am not so keen on her developing powers from the rock. At least not permanent powers
shield,3943t0,Scorpion197,2,Wed Jun 10 04:22:59 2015 UTC,"Agreed,combat prowess isnt everything,and i think if everyone starts getting powers the show will lose something."
shield,3943t0,Bookbringer,3,Thu Jun 11 18:05:22 2015 UTC,I think they don't give him any is because you are not suppose to root for murdering psychopathic killer who tortured Bobbi and portray him as a badass and I don't see him as particularly strong didn't Coulson say he could kick his ass.
shield,3943t0,ExcaliburZSH,12,Tue Jun 9 06:00:45 2015 UTC,"Badass fight sequences are an awesome way to establish how threatening a villain is.  Example: When Daredevil's Fisk rips apart the Russian using only his bare hands and a car door. Fans can root for whoever the hell they want. Ward is an amazing fighter (according to in-universe comments and his fight sequences with non-mains.) If you think otherwise, you may be experiencing the Worf effect. When Ward gets his ass kicked, it's to showcase how awesome the other character is (May's the freaking Cavalry and Bobbi's the goddamn Mockingbird and he still held his own) -- not how awesome Ward isn't. Coulson took on possessed!Mack, so if he can take Ward, I would count that as proof that Coulson fucking rocks, not that Ward isn't very strong.   Warning: Tvtropes link."
shield,3943t0,Bookbringer,2,Tue Jun 9 13:15:24 2015 UTC,Worf effect.   Poor Worf. DS9 allowed him to shoot so many people to make up for Next Gen.
shield,3943t0,Bookbringer,3,Wed Jun 10 04:20:11 2015 UTC,In episode 1 Coulson or Maria Hill mention Ward was the highest ranked agent in the academy since Romanoff.
shield,3943t0,ExcaliburZSH,7,Tue Jun 9 09:47:54 2015 UTC,"Technically that was in espionage, not hand to hand combat."
shield,3943t0,ARflash,3,Tue Jun 9 12:41:42 2015 UTC,"I feel like the two go hand in hand but, ya you're right."
shield,3943t0,zackogenic,4,Tue Jun 9 13:17:36 2015 UTC,"Nah, the espionage part refers to the spy & undercover stuff -- lying, manipulation, keeping secrets, gathering intel -- all the stuff he did  for Garrett."
shield,3943t0,ExcaliburZSH,1 point,Tue Jun 9 13:38:16 2015 UTC,"How many season did Dexter run? Breaking Bad? The SHIELD (the cop show)?  That used to be the run in TV but now it ""lets root for the bad guy"" these days. Heck even Sherlock Holmes is crazier these days (BBC version)."
shield,3943t0,ExcaliburZSH,1 point,Wed Jun 10 04:17:21 2015 UTC,Those were the Main Characters of there shows. There have been episodes when Ward does not show up at all are they were good. Ward is not nearly as interesting as those characters so I don't think he should rooted for or shown how much he is a good fighter.
