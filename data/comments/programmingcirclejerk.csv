programmingcirclejerk,3dny4n,h3st,0,Mon Jul 20 18:25:19 2015 UTC,"For me it's mostly a matter of scoping. Haskell's typeclasses exist in some form of magical global namespace (except it's not actually global, because you still need to import the relevant module), same for instances. You can't define typeclasses locally in a let-binding (actually Haskell and, to a lesser extent, Scala, do pretty poorly in this respect, especially when compared to OCaml, which will happily let you define local types and modules in let-bindings), you can't define instances locally, and so on. There's also the fact that typeclasses are an entirely new construct: they're neither types, values nor kinds, and I find them to be annoying from a theoretical point of view since they're completely useless: they amount to nothing more and nothing less than syntactic sugar over explicit dictionary passing, which IMO doesn't warrant the introduction of a new category of ""kinda-kinds-but-not-actually-kinds"" to your system.  Implicit parameters, by contrast, allow you to modularize both the ""typeclass"" definition itself and the instance definitions, you can have local instances, explicitly override them in particular cases, and they don't introduce any extra elements to the base language definition. Furthermore, with a Sufficiently Expressive Type System{TM}, they can do out of the box all the stuff that typeclasses took so long to get as language extensions (I'm mainly thinking of type families and typeclass-polymorphic functions). In Scala you could even have something like higher-order typeclasses like the following pseudo-Haskal:  foo :: (SomeTypeClassClass t, t a) => a -> a   Not that these are any useful..."

The week before I was optmizing my non-C JPEG decoder, but the main thing that writes the pixels to a windows bitmap for testing simply writes each pixel (received in non-100% linear order) to disk. The pixels come in blocks of 8h*8v per image component so the order is weird and I just seek and write where it needs to be. Also to write to the next horizontal line it just seeks lol. I'm thinking this might be the cause... All the seeking and hammering could have corrupted the filesystem structures, leading to this, or it could have been that the first time I tried to compile the package, the computer lost power.  The Makefile generated by autoconf/automake says something like this for each file in the project:  gcc-blah-blah -c a.c -o a.o   Then I go look at a .o file in vim, and it's a random distro file or source code from random unrelated folder like gedit.!!!?  mfw seeing some shit like this:  $ cat blah.o /*   * The Python Imaging Library.  *  * standard decoder interfaces for the Imaging library  *  * history:  * 1996-03-28 fl   Moved from _imagingmodule.c  * 1996-04-15 fl   Support subregions in setimage  * 1996-04-19 fl   Allocate decoder buffer (where appropriate)  * 1996-05-02 fl   Added jpeg decoder  * 1996-05-12 fl   Compile cleanly as C++  * 1996-05-16 fl   Added hex decoder  * 1996-05-26 fl   Added jpeg configuration parameters  * 1996-12-14 fl   Added zip decoder  * 1996-12-30 fl   Plugged potential memory leak for tiled images  * 1997-01-03 fl   Added fli and msp decoders  * 1997-01-04 fl   Added sun_rle and tga_rle decoders  * 1997-05-31 fl   Added bitfield decoder  * 1998-09-11 fl   Added orientation and pixelsize fields to tga_rle decoder  * 1998-12-29 fl   Added mode/rawmode argument to decoders  * 1998-12-30 fl   Added mode argument to *all* decoders  * 2002-06-09 fl   Added stride argument to pcx decoder  *  * Copyright (c) 1997-2002 by Secret Labs AB.  * Copyright (c) 1995-2002 by Fredrik Lundh.  *  * See the README file for information on usage and redistribution.  */  /* FIXME: make these pluggable! */  #include ""Python.h""  #if PY_VERSION_HEX < 0x01060000 #define PyObject_New PyObject_NEW #define PyObject_Del PyMem_DEL #endif  #include ""Imaging.h""  #include ""Gif.h"" #include ""Lzw.h"" #include ""   (This is not the real output, but in the real one, the source code that's in the .o file is truncated randomly - I didn't record where)  Note also, I don't think I have gedit souce anywhere on that filesystem currently. Which makes me think it's a filesystem error ... pulling old deleted data into new files somehow... Maybe there's a list of fully zeroed blocks which the filesystem uses, and somehow the disk got corrupt and inserted non-zero blocks in to it? When you do lseek(2) far ahead, the previous data is zeroed, so maybe such a feature could be used in that case ignoring cache and assuming it doesn't do some run length encoding.  The .o files all seem to contain completely irrelevant data, I have no idea. I assume the printed gcc commands are actually what's being run... the .o files don't exist initially, and after make, they're there but contain the wrong data.  Where the run of make actually fails is when making an archive file... it does something like ar cru douchebag.a a.o b.o c.o d.o..., then complains like this:  ar: douchebag.a: File format not recognized   and I look at douchebag.a:  $ cat douchebag.a !<arch>   Which is an empty ar file.. Even if that was the .a file when ar accessed it, it should still work. IIRC there was no .a file to begin with before ar even gets run, so it should have just made a new one from scratch. Maybe it edits the .a file once per added file, and breaks in between?  I wrapped gcc to strace what gcc is doing when it tries to compile one of the files I know will give an invalid .o... But the first few runs it started complaining about limits.h missing and compilation repeatedly aborting, then the build somehow ""succeeded"" anyway. Eventually it just compiled fine and now it's running again. Also, I had parallel make on.. my mistake, I should know better than to trust linux with things like concurrency or hammering the disk."

There is no possible universe in which 'param' is an acceptable name for an argument.    map (\param -> param+1) stuff  Oh wait he's right for the wrong reason: param is too long.  It should be map (\x -> x+1) stuff, or if your syntax allows: map (+1) stuff. Even cofeetardscript and groovy IIRC each have something similar to map(it+1,stuff).  You could do this for any callback/higher order function/subclass. It's especially retarded to bitch about the name being non self describing in something like this:  @Override void handleHttpRequest(HttpRequest h) { }    To actually comprehend this function requires storing those 14 names in short-term memory, reading through the over 300 lines of remaining code, filling in bits of the meaning of those names as they become clear, and only then reading the code again with that mental map. That's the case where none of the 14 have slipped my mind by the time I get back around. That just seems like an awful lot of overhead to net something that could be as easy as reading names if they were better chosen.   Okay well maybe the function is complex, which is a different issue. If the issue is the variable names, you don't understand the function in the first place. You can't read code and conclude the meaning of a variable by name - that's exactly how 99% of vulns come into existence in the first place. More formal things like types can give some meaning, but the name of a variable within the scope of a function is usually meaningless (aside from giving you a hint of what the function does) if you're responsible for editing/auditing that function.

Go ahead, ask me how long the email chain at work was when someone said that Collectors.joining("","") was more convenient than looping over shit and deleting the last comma.  String processing by itself could be a fucking novel. Pre-1.8, Java Strings seem like they were purposefully written to require com.mycompany.addedvalue.StringsPlusPlus shit to do even basic tasks.

Speaking of lambdas, Java can't even do that .NET 2.0 shit right. A lambda stacktrace looks like my VM vomited all sorts of someTypeErased$DynamicShit onto my screen. Compared to an anonymous class implementing an interface exploding into a traceback, it's practically written in Perl (yeah, fuck those guys too).  In my more cynical moments I really suspect that Java 1.4 and prior were released with all sorts of flaws to encourage enterprising consultants and software douchebags to write their own ""Utils"" extensions to the horribly lacking stdlibs.  The fact that 15 years go ""Design Pattern"" literature was practicaly mandatory--and patterns pretty much still are for doing OOP in Java, since its object model is remarkably weak for it being the leading OO language--should go to show something: Java's shortcomings are so great that entire careers are founded on them alone.

One unexpected thing was heap exhaustion during compilation. We rely heavily on macros, and some of the largest ones expand into thousands of lines of low-level code.

Indeed, the abstractions we've created over the years do allow us to deal with new orders of complexity in software development that we didn't have to deal with ten or fifteen years ago, like GUI programming and network programming. And while these great tools, like modern OO forms-based languages, let us get a lot of work done incredibly quickly, suddenly one day we need to figure out a problem where the abstraction leaked, and it takes 2 weeks. And when you need to hire a programmer to do mostly VB programming, it's not good enough to hire a VB programmer, because they will get completely stuck in tar every time the VB abstraction leaks.  The Law of Leaky Abstractions is dragging us down.   But lol we'll write our own programming language that transpiles to VB, PHP or god knows whatever fuck Windows XML/script hybrid in some years anyway."

Doing proper systems engineering trade studies when choosing hardware and software platforms (when not chosen for us by politics <_<).  A proper change review/change management system that went well beyond making sure VCS messages made sense.  Real systems engineering in designing and coordinating APIs between sections of the code, and in coordination with the hardware design teams where we were custom-building the hardware."

I have yet to see any evidence that there's any benefit to compiling languages like Scala to JVM bytecode rather than to Java. Java programs could just be served as source and save the 400 page JVM spec which is basically just a mirror of the JLS with a bunch of new ways for stuff to break. And I don't think compiling source code to bytecode saves the end user any time.  Ignoring all this, it's already ridiculous to have 50 different languages that are almost exactly the same because your developers are too OCD to just stick to one language. MSIL and JVM bytecode are basically the exact same thing as C#/Java (and hence the decompilers almost never get anything wrong aside from bugs) except they just make things harder (for people trying to implement sandboxing, code transformation, cross-language-same-vm libs etc) because of all the subtle differences they have."

EDIT: can't jerk to this, top quality stuff.  http://mattbruenig.com/2015/06/06/the-amusing-case-of-tech-libertarians/   A 22-year-old techie that comes on to the scene today is standing on the tip of thousands of years of accumulated math knowledge, materials sciences, electricity breakthroughs, chip manufacturing breakthroughs, hardware innovations like integrated circuits, an entire library of software to both learn from and use, and of course hundreds of thousands of dollars of educational investments they had nothing to do with. Yet, the little bit they mix on top of all of that is enough to convince some they are truly Great Men of the John Galt variety.  As common as this story is more generally, the fact that a successful young tech libertarian largely relies upon what is essentially communistically developed free software makes it especially precious. These folks step on to the scene with tens of millions of lines of donated community code at their back, marshall it towards some slightly new end, and then declare that they owe nothing to anybody and are self-made geniuses that the rest of society, through their taxation or regulation, is unduly oppressing."

The reason I use them is simply because I'm forced to, not because they're good in any way. Does this guy even use software? Everything I use crashes in basic scenarios. Chat clients that don't automatically reconnect, bring new GUI enhancements and bugs in each release, crash or corrupt when receiving certain HTML, such as <img> (why the fuck do they even use HTML in the first place????). File managers that crash from basic race conditions such as trying to paste a file into a folder with tons of files before it loads the full list. Retarded window managers that break in basic use cases like trying to float one window over the others (XMonad, haven't used the others for years).   Not only did this communistic ecosystem of software beat out proprietary competitors, but it has also had the effect of dramatically reducing barriers to web and app innovation.   Because shitty video(flash or <video>)/audio/image websites with all kinds of restrictions and DRM-but-not-really-but-just-enough-to-satisfy-the-CEO which are 1000X worse than Kazaa 10 years ago is innovation. Because super web first chat programs that reorder and replay your messages every 5 times (lol hipchat) and full of spoofing vulns (lol hipchat) etc - is innovation. Because having a site to view song lyrics, blogs, news, recipes, health information, filled with 1000 ads, popups, custom CSS/JS, and all buggy in new novel ways despite all doing the same thing - showing a few paragraphs of text to the user - is innovation. Because games that use web as UI (LOL BF4) and are buggy as fuck and somehow worse than games that roll their own custom GUI every time with 0 reuse is innovation. Because writing 100000 Apps that break from latency, disruption, or low bandwidth scenarios in novel ways - is innovation. Does this guy even internet? Does he realize how obnoxious that fucking Disqus comment system he's using is?  This guy is proof that lots of the Open Source Community is just a competition to be slightly better than propriecunts.   Tens of thousands of competent hobbyist eyeballs were able to spot problems,   Yeah bro, we found all those style guide violations thanks to open source, and five actual problems a year. Look how successful we are! Imagine if instead of having 100000 apps that do the same thing but none of them worked, we had maybe only 100 that did the same thing, and some of them sort of worked. Then we'd have 1000x as many real problems being found!   If the software that comprised modern web stacks was proprietary, not only would they be less flexible to use and modify, but theyâd be super-expensive. Thereâd be extraordinary cost barriers to actually putting out a new website or app service.    That's not even a thing. It's trivial to roll your own Web Stack - that's why there are already 52342355235 of them, and 10000 more just got made in the last 5 minutes. Any asshole can make his own NGINX by figuring out that select and friends exist, proceeding to read the 10 pages of docs on how to use them, and proceed to tell everyone that their new super hacked server is super magical and uses super magical technology like not letting the user use preemption ever. Anything above the web server can be made in 5 minutes and will suck invariably, because web the sucks penis period. No you don't understand."

You might probably as well phrase that as ""It *is* possible to write PL/I code that does something half-way portably useful, but you have to really work at it."".  Sure, you can write bad programs in C, and C allows you to do that.  But C allows you to do that exactly because C allows you to do pretty much _anything_.  There are no barriers.  You can, as a programmer, say ""this is what I want to do"", and C will just do it.  It won't question your sanity, and it also won't say ""yeah, you can do it, but you need to jump through hoops to show you really want to first"".  C says ""you're the boss"", and just does it. Without any politics, without any hidden agenda by silly language designers.  You appear to want programming languages that enforce things, to avoid buffer overflows etc.  But think about _why_ C is a popular language for a second first.  I claim it is exactly because it doesn't get in your way - sure it allows you to shoot yourself in the head, but it does so because it allows _anything_.  And I'll take a language that allows me anything, over a language that thinks the programmer needs hand-holding and limiting. Is it a bit chaotic? Sure, but the power means that you can write libraries and complex infrastructure in the same language, without having strange barriers.  Try to do the same in just about any language, and you'll most likely fail. Look at how many languages have C bindings just because the languages themselves are not able to do some things reasonably.  When you try to restrict what people can easily do, you will FAIL.              Linus   source http://yarchive.net/comp/c.html"

I managed to do just enough in my interviews to squeak through, but in doing so realized that it wasn't for me.  Walking through the cafeteria made me feel like I was back in CMU CS again, in a bad way.    Seems like a company founded by PhD students will inevitably have a culture that values academic theory over practical value.  Which isn't to say that's a terrible thing, clearly they do some things that require that mindset.  But it definitely isn't for everybody.

Which isn't to say that's a terrible thing   Unless you are working in academia, it's absolutely a terrible thing. I'm a web developer. I don't do systems work, I'm not writing drivers.  I could spend 20 minutes in an interview talking about CSS or JS in different browsers, how best to structure an MVC application, or the tradeoffs with different database designs or C# design patterns.  If you ask me to invert a red-black tree you either pulled the interview questions off the internet, you have no idea what job I'm actually applying for, or you're a self-righteous twat who asks questions that serve no practical purpose so you can mentally masturbate over judging other people. None of those are people I want to work for or with.  I'll say ""I don't know,"" probably make some joke about not having had a need to do that on my last web development project, and absolutely not call you back if you end up calling me."

Can you explain why this algorithm isn't included in standard collection libraries?  Could you right now implement a red black tree correctly by hand?  And could you explain to me and swear in this stack of K&R books why you would never, ever, in a million years,  even if we held your beloved dog hostage, hand implement a sorted tree structure in a work environment instead of using an existing debugged one like a normal person?  Honestly Google needs about twenty people total who can answer that interview question and are good at writing libraries.  Nobody else should be experimenting on data structures that can fail so spectacularly and comically when they have bugs.  And you are a human, so there will be bugs.  And Google has pretty much already said this to be the case.  They have tons of libraries and are writing their own languages for chrissakes.  They don't need and don't have 100,000 Devs who can do this at they end of a long interview at a place some are so excited to get a chance to work at that they are nervous."

programmingcirclejerk,396ih7,modernserf_,7,Tue Jun 9 23:01:49 2015 UTC,"my favorite comment:   Too little too late. Apple could have got my attention if they had done this from the start, but at this point I find it hard to get excited about this. Half the reason I find myself drawn to a new language is the culture and community surrounding it. You might think this seems silly at first glance, they're programming languages, not fraternities. But hear me out.  Golang is a pragmatic crowd. Go into #go-nuts on freenode, you'll notice that discussion rarely deviates from solving problems. Many links to the go playground. Go, from the beginning, shaped their community in this way. Consciously? Who knows. But the community turned out the way it did and I believe that's a result of their start.  Haskell is a computer scientist crowd. People write in haskell because they enjoy the functional paradigm and haskell is a purely functional language. Discussion on freenode? Very dense. People are expected to grasp topics easily and the community initially gives everyone the benefit of the doubt that they are capable of understanding it until they ask for more help.  When I look at swift, the only thought I have is that it is the new iOS language. I don't believe they'll be able to deviate from that. I don't see myself making iOS apps, so I don't see myself every writing a single line of the language. When I first looked at swift, my impression was that it was a wierd and somewhat-functional language that had a few unique things. Maybe I would have taken an interest in it. But at this point, I don't want to have to wade through a bunch of iOS specific questions to get what I need. I don't want to have to deal with being a beta tester for their linux implementations. I don't want to use the language when I'm probably going to be using it in a vastly different way than the rest of the community is. My interests are going to be second class.  It's not necessarily set in stone, but I think it is. In a world where there's a new language every day, I just don't see why I'd go with swift."

I'd even go so far to say that I don't make my singletons end with the word Utils.   and see it as a good way to develop massive programs (1 million plus SLOC)   Yeah bro the fact that your shitideas geniusideas leak through into your struct members' names has nothing to do with people being able to user your code. OOP is the reason anyone can modify your 1 million line code base. You don't even use structs. What is this, C? You use OOP, which means people have to call getX and setX to get/set fields on your object, which means it's OOP and encapsulated when people call dog.setType(Animal.CAT) and dog.setSound(""/enterprisesoundsystem/hypervisor/synergeticsynergyadapatationlayer/woof.mp3""). A cat dog is perfectly valid because we used encapsulation to create it. The other layers should be defensive and not notice this, and also cat dogs are valid in some cases. For example it will still make the right sound. If there is any problem it's because you're doing it wrong."

programmingcirclejerk,38zx1s,glggglg,2,Mon Jun 8 13:01:35 2015 UTC,"ls is perfectly designed   ""But why does ls have 30 flags?"" Because it is used by human beings, and their interactions with computers cannot be reduced to a couple of easy-to-follow rules of thumb.   Exactly, they can be reduced to flags but not use of function application (because bash doesn't have that lol).   Because human beings don't want to have to use map and reprogram what the developers of ls had to do at every invocation.   Lol but unix has sort and is the common example of The Unix Way. The difference is obviously that since it's impossible to implement map for the shell, map is not unix way.  Clearly plebs don't know that ls -q is there for when you're using a shell that has metacharacter vulnerabilities (lol this is not every shell I swear use my new uxvrt-value-added-swag-artisanal-edition it's totally secure because it has lots of lines of code and I just learned C last night), and ls -Q is there for when you want to pass the output of ls to another program that so happens to take whatever syntax -Q generates.  $ ls  ur mom  wtf'  wtf""  wut $ ls -Q ""ur mom""  ""wtf'""  ""wtf\""""  ""wut""  $ gedit `ls -Q | xargs` xargs: unmatched double quote; by default quotes are special to xargs unless you use the -0 option   oh wait  I guess I'm not a true unix user. I tried. Maybe I can fix this by shitting out an awk or perl script for a special snowflake syntax I just learned about right now tho. I know!

The person in the article mentioned not using C++, Java, PHP or Go, and someone in the comments assumed that they were using Javascript.

GvR Basically, yes.  LW Why don't you ask your mother? She's dealt with you.  GvR Well my mom is not a language desig... wait, what are you trying to say?

Besides, my public appearances have Perl programmers as their target audience, not outright idiots like you.  GvR Outright idiot? You know I'm not. You're just outright aggressive.  LW Outright aggressive, what a wonderfully on point phrase. Outright aggressive. Is that supposed to be worse than being passive aggressive? Remember the joke you made in a keynote about how Perl programmers like to write unreadable one liners? That was fucking original. Or what about this? What about this fucking conversation?! Calling me asking about how I dealt with my language being less popular than yours ... You know what, screw this, my mustache is way too sexy for this shit.  Larry hangs up the phone.

Yukihiro Matsumoto Well, I've always thought he seems nice, but what do you think I should do?  LW I don't know. You made a horribly slow object oriented language in the 90s, so I guess you could write a horribly slow functional language in the 10s.

There's no library for this? lol..."
programmingcirclejerk,38i3j4,glggglg,7,Thu Jun 4 18:55:26 2015 UTC,"You've got the jist of it correct but you're totally ignoring the real-time aspect of video playback.  The full frames are usually spaced about 2-3 seconds apart (~90 frames for a 30 fps clip).  If you want to rewind to the nth frames in that interval, on an average case, you'd need to decode about 45 frames in 33 ms (assuming 30 fps clip) to meet real-time constraints.  That's as good as 1350  fps, which is beyond the capability of most hardware.  That's not to mention that you'd probably need to do the same thing for the n-1th frame, n-2th frame etc.  You could of course save the pictures from the first time you decoded them (for the nth frame), but you'll get killed on memory requirements (~141 MB in the case I described above, which is nontrivial on a phone).    tl;dr Video files aren't webscale"
programmingcirclejerk,38i3j4,SnowdensOfYesteryear,3,Thu Jun 4 19:23:40 2015 UTC,"Can't you just decode whatever the minimal amount is (which, assuming the computer can handle playing the video forward in the first place, will make the user have to initially wait at most as long as that amount is, so 3 seconds according to your number), then while playing back the buffered decoded frames in reverse, decode the next block of frames so it's there once the user reaches that point?  Also, without resorting to that, isn't it much faster to decode non-full frames? For example I think MPEG 2 has to run IDCT which would be hugely expensive on full frames, but even if it does it for non-full frames (motion compensated or delta or whatever it does), it wont be nearly as bad since there's much less stuff to run IDCT on. Though there may be other huge performance factors in MPEG 2 I don't know about. I have no idea about AVC or newer formats.  Can anyone who knows how video encoding X works easily implement rewind for X or is there actually some magic? Maybe they can decode a previous frame from the current frame (maybe using some tricks that humans wont visually notice)... I don't see how that's possible though. I assume most ""X is hard"" statements online are bogus or equivalent to ""people who don't work in this field don't immediately know how to do this"" so that's the only reason I question what you're saying.  141mb wouldn't be bad for the primary application a user is currrently using... the phone I got years ago has 2GB memory. just close the web browser bruh. so what in the worse case some users can't use rewind.

programmingcirclejerk,37hbxv,lord_braleigh,2,Wed May 27 21:13:26 2015 UTC,"By introducing generics you make the type system more complex, thus making the type checker more complex. More complex type checker means, all other things being equal, slower type checker and type checking is part of compilation."
programmingcirclejerk,37hbxv,afrobee,2,Wed May 27 21:34:25 2015 UTC,"Say T_A and T_B are T<A> and T<B> instantiated by hand. Can you name one specific example where compiling T_A and T_B is faster than compiling T<A> and T<B> (ideally without mentioning OOP)?  I think instantiating T will just make a new type for each variable. I.e, T<A> will just generate a new type T_A and T<B> will generate T_B, etc. Then any actual typechecks will just be the same as checking for non-generic types right?  At least in all the cases I can think of right now, there's no difference in checking instantiated generic types vs checking non-generic types:  void blahA(A x, A y) {...} void <T> blahG(T x, T y){...}  void f(A x, B y) {     blahA(x, y); // fail. simply sees that y is not an A     blah<A>(x, y); // fail. simply sees that y is not an A }  WutAB {     A x;     B y; }  WutGeneric<T1,T2> {     T1 x;     T2 y; }  void g(WutAB wa, WutGeneric<A,B> wg, A a, B b) {     wa.x = wa.y; // fail. simply sees that wa.y is not an A     wa.x = b; // fail. simply sees that b is not an A     wg.x = wg.y; // fail. simply sees that wg.y is not an A     wg.x = b; // fail. simply sees that b is not an A }  void <X,Y> g2(WutGeneric<X,Y> wg, X a, Y b) {     wg.x = wg.y; // fail. simply sees that wg.y is not an X     wg.x = b; // fail. simply sees that b is not an X }   All the compiler has to do is literally go through the tree and check each operation's consistency. Anyway I might be missing something since I've never implemented a language that has syntax/tolerates errors in the syntax/types. If an operation takes an A, it checks if the parameter being applied is an A. This check can even be super duper fast because all it has to do is compare two symbols! :O For an instantiated type, it can just generate a fresh one of these symbols (deterministically)."
programmingcirclejerk,37hbxv,possibly-necessary,1 point,Wed May 27 22:56:01 2015 UTC,"To be honest I am not really qualified to speak with much confidence about this, but I don't think it is quite as simple as:   I think instantiating T will just make a new type for each variable. I.e, T<A> will just generate a new type T_A and T<B> will generate T_B, etc. Then any actual typechecks will just be the same as checking for non-generic types right?   Take your last example:  void <X,Y> g2(WutGeneric<X,Y> wg, X a, Y b) {     wg.x = wg.y; // fail. simply sees that wg.y is not an X     wg.x = b; // fail. simply sees that b is not an X }   With your method, depending on how you instantiate this function it either be well typed or a type error. So if you don't extend your type system to handle this in some way, you essentially lose type checking when writing generic code, and only get type errors when you start instancing your generic code.  Also, your version of generics is very simplistic. It would be nice to be able to write a generic function, which requires generic variables to satisfy some interface. For example sort taking a collection of elements which satisfy the Comparable interface. This further complicates things."

The code you're referring to is not well-typed in any context. It can't even be instantiated.  We know this simply by seeing that X and Y are two different types, WutGeneric<X,Y> = { X x; Y y } (thus wg.x : X, and w.g.y : Y), and there is an attempt to assign wg.y to wg.x or ignoring that, there is an attempt to assign b (which is a Y) to wg.x.  I don't think interfaces are any different. What's the difference between type checking a generic interface and type checking any other generic type? Looks the same to me:  interface Comparable<T> {     int compare(T, T); }  T get<T>(List<T> l, int i){...}  void sort<T implements Comparable>(List<T> l) {     T e0 = get<T>(l,0);     T e1 = get<T>(l,1);     e0.compare(e1); // fine     A x = ...;     e0.compare(x); // fail. x is not a T     l.head = e1; // fine, e1 is a T     l.head = x; // fail. x is not a T }  void useSort(List<A> la, List<B> lb) {     sort<A>(la);     sort<B>(la); // fail. lb is not a List<A>     A a = get<A>(la,0);     sort<A>(a); // fail. a is not a List<A> }"

So you are not type checking by simply instantiating to concrete types and using the same old type checker (how else would you know that it is not well-typed). You need a type checker which supports some form of polymorphism. Maybe I am wrong, but to me it seems this implies that, all other things being equal, you need a more complicated type checker.

Since X and Y are different letters, they are considered different types. You could instantiate with both X and Y being A, but the generic code can't ever assume they are the same type. This is how Java works, and C# AFAIK, and ML, and haskell.   So you are not type checking by simply instantiating to concrete types and using the same old type checker (how else would you know that it is not well-typed).   Both concrete types and generic types can simply be denoted by simple symbols, like in all my examples. All the type checker has to do is check whether the two symbols are the same.   By looking at Java, and the discussion around Java generics it is clear to me that there are plenty of things to consider, and that it is not as simple as not having generics.   Java has all kinds of other issues. For example it has to combine generics with inheritance. Also for some reason half the discussion about generics is about type erasure, which ... only matters if you're doing reflection? Also, Java doesn't even compile generics, it puts a bunch of casts and crap in the outputted code. Java recently got new partially working ""type inference"" for generics (in 8 and maybe some in 7), for instance, instead of calling A a = FunctionHoldingClass.<A>get(list,2), you can now just do A a = get(list,2) (can't remember if this is the exact case it fixes, but it's something like this), and instead of T<B,C<List<Set<Y>>> t = new T<B,C<List<Set<Y>>>(), you can now just do T<B,C<List<Set<Y>>> t = new T<>(), and a bunch of other cases I forget, but nobody noticed, because almost no Java developers actually use generics, and the ones that do bypass most of the problems with Java generics by using ""patterns"". Also Eclipse, Netbeans, and IDEA all fail in parsing/type checking my simple 10K line codebase at different locations in the code. The small type inference changes did reduce my code by thousands of lines (or at least reduced the size of thousands of lines by 2) though.

I'm sure there are existing compilers that do this (at least for languages with generics and not templates). This sounds as horrible as the practice of generating toString/hashCode/equals/toJSON/compare etc in Java. Say you want to add a new field to the class with toString. Now you have to either modify toString by hand or regenerate it. You have to take into account whether your codebase's policy allows hand modified generated code or not - if they do, you can't ever regenerate any toString (unless you have a tool to automatically regenerate toString and compare it against the existing toString - to tell you whether the generated code was modified by hand). This is one of the biggest or most prevalent worse-is-better things in Java, aside from all the enterprise-turds. The proper way in Java would have been having some annotation or whatever saying toString is directly derived from the definition of the type, like deriving Show, deriving Ord, etc, in Haskal.."

Overall the problem with Python is, besides LOLGIL and being slower than dogshit, it's too forgiving of noobs, but worse than that, forgiving of people who don't know how to fucking program but know how to vomit legal programming syntax into an editor window (though with Python, it's just as likely they vomited it into a TTY on a server node because ""why would you develop on a different environment""). At least in Java, it won't fucking compile... Python will eagerly compile then stop working deep in some almost-never reached branch of your program--see above re: ""forgiving"" and ""noobs"" if you can't understand how there's fogotten branches of control flow in your code  I have the opposite problem, actually. If i leave my own code alone for a week, some Perl user comes in and writes a bunch of legal Python syntax that ""fixes"" bugs by deadlocking the entire __main__ thread  Man, this is like the third time this week I've said ""at least in Java..."""

programmingcirclejerk,36rqdp,possibly-necessary,3,Fri May 22 14:19:00 2015 UTC,"Resident OCaml fan here. I think this is a good explanation. Long story short, OCaml doesn't have a GIL, but its garbage collector wasn't designed to deal with multithreaded applications, in order to provide the best possible performance for single-thread applications. The core of the problem is that in an impure functional language you would need to stop all threads every time you do GC, because otherwise some thread may be rewriting the pointer structure as your GC thread walks the tree.  This goes back to when Xavier Leroy famously insisted that programs in the future would be based on zero-sharing, message passing architectures. In hindsight, it was a terrible idea, but it allowed OCaml to be ridiculously fast (for a high level functional language) back in the day."

I should've known when the gender drama found its way here, fucking SJWs.  Anyway, I wasn't saying ""open source is communism"" - my own game engine is open source. I'm saying that the virus-like GPL license and hardcore staunchly 'proprietary software is evil' camp are. Closed-off, walled-garden software isn't always a bad thing if it means the company peddling it can provide actual quality (e.g. Apple - I hate their stuff but I understand why others don't). Compare to most 'FOSStard' crap out there (this post written hypocritically using Firefox- but I did say 'most'). Money makes the world go around.  To put it another way, I feel there's a confusion between having program code open source, auditable, and editable (pretty useful + good in most cases), and forcing everyone to do that, even when it would harm the protection of their IP (fucking commies). Stallman et. al. are, in my opinion, mostly sat in the latter camp. It really shines through when you read something like https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/shouldbefree.html:   [Talking about opponents of FSF] The emotional argument goes like this: âI put my sweat, my heart, my soul into this program. It comes from me, it's mine!â   The proceeding refutation that no one is allowed to feel as though they own their own creation sounds pretty commie to me. Also contains pretty stupid arguments (""if you want a salary you have no right to own anything you create!!!1"").  And of course, typical left pseudo-morality bullshit like:   [Constructing a strawman]: âI want to get rich (usually described inaccurately as âmaking a livingâ), and if you don't allow me to get rich by programming, then I won't program.""   There was an interesting article in a (normally left-wing) newspaper after the UK general election here, one quote that stuck out to me: ""why should it be shameful to vote to keep more of the money youâve earned, but noble to vote to appropriate other peopleâs money and award it to yourself, or to the groups with which you personally sympathise?"" - Same applies here. If I want to make money selling something of value, that's how it should be. Why should you plebs get any of that?  Anyway, some may argue that I'm taking this way too seriously; I'm not a humourless fuck, I promise. But sue me IDGAF etc"
programmingcirclejerk,36c01n,mortadelegle,7,Mon May 18 14:18:52 2015 UTC,"I don't know much about licensing (I let the BS department handle that) or RMS, but non-source code distribution is cargo cult BS. The only excuse is because every web browser takes a day to compile (due to being full of cargo cult and value adds, and because web) so it's easier to provide a binary.  If you care about protecting IP (which is not a thing IMO), a binary alone is not good enough. You need to have fully self modifying code which only reveals parts at a time so that the analyst can't dump the image into IDA or whatever for easy static analysis. This is already strongly reducing your code quality and perhaps performance. We are already applying cargo cult methodologies like SSP/Canaries, ASLR, etc, which already (supposedly) have a performance hit, to remedy the existence of C(++). But the analyst can still use kernel/CPU tricks like breakpoints, TLB desychronization, etc to get dynamic analysis god mode. To prevent this, you have to move your shit into the kernel. Now you have to make sure A) your kernel space turds don't interfere with other kernel space turds and B) your kernel space turds don't introduce vulns and get the user's bank account stolen, or break some enterprise authentication system (which it will do both, because Windows is already fragile and broken in the first place, plus combining two kernel space turds can create new kinds of vulns).  Every time someone reverse engineers some compiled code that nobody's touched before, it's like turning over a new rock with the bottom covered in shit. It's usually some idiosyncratic crap made by some poor 9-5 cargo cult members within a small business out in the business park.  That being said *nix isn't much better than closed source crap."
programmingcirclejerk,36c01n,mrcactus28,3,Mon May 18 15:14:34 2015 UTC,"The thing that makes the IP less protected isn't the fact that the code is open, but that the FSF don't think you should be able to own it or its direction/reproduction/modification.

I probably conflated that, sorry. I know closed source doesn't mean unstealable.   The GPL does direct re-use by requiring further use of GPL, effectively ensuring that someone can't re-package. AGPL lets you sell rights to suspend mandatory GPL, effectively allowing someone to distribute a program without your source. If you want to distribute source but also sell code, this is the license to use, since its terms are clearly understood. There was some guy who tried to sue some linux distros for patching code he had released under a custom license, but why would you sue a poor person? That's just retarded.  MIT/Apache/BSD is the one that effectively un-owns your code since anyone can redistribute for any purpose. This makes it easier for other people to sell your stuff as theirs. If that's what you mean by ""own []its direction/reproduction"", well, that sounds like someone else claimed ownership of it.  FSF is still pretty fucking retarded, in typical tech-hippie-libertarian fashion--checkout that awesome link where they moan about JS as if somehow Flash or ActiveX were more ""open""--but they're in the IP argument-o-sphere, which is retarded to start with. ""IP"" is this insane, intentionally nebulous concept compared, e.g., to copyright, which is far easier to enforce."

programmingcirclejerk,36c01n,skulgnome,2,Mon May 18 16:34:29 2015 UTC,"Well the GPL is the most-hated of the OSS licenses because it's ""restrictive"", which means that, effectively, the person who issues the license still has some control over it (even if the only control they retain the preventing other people from claiming ownership of it). I assume this is because you can't delude yourself into thinking someone is using your shitty github library to make millions of dollars.

I'm reminded of something from Crime and Puzzlement:   Sometime in December 1988, a 21 year-old Atlanta-area Legion of Doomster named The Prophet cracked a Bell South computer and downloaded a three-page text file which outlined, in bureaucrat-ese of surpassing opacity, the administrative procedures and responsibilities for marketing, servicing, upgrading, and billing for Bell South's 911 system.  A dense thicket of acronyms, the document was filled with passages like:  ""In accordance with the basic SSC/MAC strategy for provisioning, the SSC/MAC will be Overall Control Office (OCO) for all Notes to PSAP circuits (official services) and any other services for this customer. Training must be scheduled for all SSC/MAC involved personnel during the pre-service stage of the project.""  And other such.  At some risk, I too have a copy of this document. To read the whole thing straight through without entering coma requires either a machine or a human who has too much practice thinking like one. Anyone who can understand it fully and fluidly has altered his consciousness beyond the ability to ever again read Blake, Whitman, or Tolstoy. It is, quite simply, the worst writing I have ever tried to read.   Now, imagine a group of people who would think that high praise; who read corporate bullshit and think it beautifully inoffensive. I'm not saying Rust people are that kind of people. I'm just saying I think they're that kind of people."

How could you develop C++ and not be pragmatic? If you're using C++ it's because you made a pragmatic decision to not go against the grain in your gamedev job, etc (implying you even know that other languages than C++ exist and can be used for gamedev if you really cared). Not any different than writing quick ollyscripts for unpacking. All though ollyscript might be a little more robust than C++...   I always suspect from a book of this kind that provides examples in multiple programming languages. Iâm sorry guys, but each language has its own rules, design decisions, optimal ways to perform a task.    Yeah bro, right tool for the right job. PHP is for small businesses to make shitty sites that can't go 4 lines of code without an RCE vuln, mojibake, or a syntax/database error on line 3. Ruby is for pre-hipsters to make shitty sites nobody gives a shit about or even knows exist and are probably also full of vulns too but nobody gives a shit. Node.js is for full hipsters to justify their existence by making useless websites that run in the cloud managed by a startup in california. Java EE and ASP.NET are for enterprise bros to do the former shit, but feel superior while doing it.  C# is also used for desktop windows programs, because Microsoft said so. Same story for Objective C or Swift on Apple crap. Same for Java on Android. Java cannot be used for desktop because lol Java. Python is used for some desktop programs, and they all have RCE vulns. C is for most linux desktop programs because if you're a linux guy the next natural step after shitting out bash trash is for you to learn C, and subsequently belittle anyone who claims it's possible to write code in another language. C++ is for writing games. No other language can be used for games except LUA, which is like C++ but scriptable.  Forth is for crazy greybeards hiding in their basement with a shotgun to write CAD tools. LISP can implement anything in 5 seconds but it's way too powerful and causes social issues. ML is for parsing (not to be confused with text manipulation, which is what Perl is for). OCaml is like ML but fast because it has hidden OO features that nobody uses, like C++, and is more pragmatic than ML literally because. Haskell is like ML but has monads and is thus super hard. It is still an open research question whether Haskell, OCaml, Nimrod, Rust, or Go can be used for web development.  Once you master some set of the above languages, you will decide to kill yourself be able to be a decent software engineer who uses the right tool for the right job.   Also the âOk guys you can optimize your regular polygon function by storing sin and cos results in a variable instead of computing that on each loop iterationâ example, ignoring optimizer capabilities that completely outperform us by doing sin and cos at the same time in one instruction only, plus loop hoisting. But I donât expect any good C/C++ advice from a place where people still think that manual assembly outperforms any compiler, and boast themselves by discarding OpenCV in favor of their own âfast square root routineâ for image processing.  Criticizing someone for making assumptions about the compiler by making further assumptions about the compiler   DAE C outperforms assembly???   The ages when a compiler was a mere code translator are gone. When doing optimizations by hand you are trying to beat the result of almost 30 years of compiler and optimization algorithms research boxed in a thing that runs on a chip that measures its computational power at MFLOPS.  Actually believing this despite all optimizers fail in trivial cases all the time  Not even acknowledging the elephant in the room that is the halting problem  Not even noticing optimizer fails all the time because performance usually doesn't even matter   DAE uniformly slow coedz???   Any advice for a complete noob to C++ coming from a very light python background? What are the first books and steps I should be taking?  wow I believe you C++ is super hard and mystical!
