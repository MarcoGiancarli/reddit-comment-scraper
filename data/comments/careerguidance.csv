You have a masters, MBA and experience, so perhaps title wise you may be moving back, but your compensation should be pretty good in consulting.   I will say that if your dream is to help businesses, you would need a more diverse background that comes from consulting. If you stay at your current employer, you gain specialization with whatever your current employer does. But your experience won't run the full gamut of industries the same way consulting would.   The thing that stood out the most from your post was the fact that they royally screwed you over and they are only fixing it because you are leaving. The only way I would feel comfortable staying is if all of this was in writing. I can totally see them promising these things, never delivering and then you're screwed again because you gave up a job for them."

It does seem very bizarre that you went from engineering to biology to finance.  You're probably being overlooked because your majors aren't really related and because you have a large amount of education. To most employers, that tells them that you don't know what your career trajectory is and that you're overqualified for most of their openings. They don't want to pay you more for your extra schooling when they can pay less for an equally competent, not over-/under-qualified candidate. Have you been including all of your degrees on your resume? Have you tried omitting one (e.g. biology since you didn't like it anyway) in order to find a better finance or engineering job? Even reading this post, I have no idea what it is you want to do for a career. If you don't have a specific direction already, maybe you should spend some time reflecting on where you would like to be in 5 years and start making short/long term goals to get there.  I'm really sorry that you had to go through all that pressure from your parents. I feel like in today's economy undergraduate education is a necessary evil. And graduate school is often used as a temporary solution for those that had less desirable undergrad majors. I feel your pain of feeling aimless when you shouldn't have to feel that way.

You can't logic yourself into being happy with your job, like ""oh well it has this perk and that perk and that perk so therefore I have to like it."" Job satisfaction can depend on so many factors other than the big two we tend to focus on (""field""/subject matter, and salary). I recently went on my first vacation from my first full-time job out of college, and when I was flying home at the end I wasn't depressed about going into the office and sitting at a desk all day (or at least not very depressed), I wasn't depressed about completing the actual tasks that are my job duties, I wasn't depressed about getting up early, and I wasn't even depressed about dealing with exasperating ""clients"" (technically not clients but that's the easiest way to describe our relationship). What I was depressed about was feeling like I don't belong, like my coworkers are not ""my people,"" even though we work well together and even sometimes voluntarily spend time together and enjoy it and I know that's way better than a lot of people can say. If having coworkers you can better identify with is an important part of what gives you job satisfaction, that's a legitimate desire and could even be worth a pay cut if you feel it's worth it -- unfortunately that's not really something anyone else can answer for you. I'd say don't take a pay cut so large you'll be struggling to pay the bills, though you probably knew that already. Take a look at what you spend your disposable income on and ask yourself, would I rather have a ""strong corporate culture"" (whatever that means to you) and coworkers I can relate to than more of this thing I spend my disposable income on?  In terms of how to explain it to potential employers, you could maybe say you're looking for more human interaction, because it's true, and because employers generally like ""people people"" rather than loners."

At some point you make a choice, and plenty of people choose the latter, for many different reasons. And there are plenty of people that choose the former and discover that they aren't really cut out to do the kind of hustling necessary to turn their passion into a full-time gig, and of those that are willing to hustle, even fewer are successful.

I should start to slowly build a stash.  At work, I manage 7 people - soon to be 8 - and disengaging means I'm being a shit manager to all those people. They're good people. I can't really do that without feeling shitty about it. My boss is already a shit manager which is part of the problem. I have no support, and often get asked to do things he really should be doing or goad him to do his part on projects. Plus, managing all those people sucks the life out of me. I'm introverted and called on to be extroverted waaaay too often lately. It was different when I did the work - less stressful by far.

Not sure where you are, but I've moved from NYC to SF and got a job offer before ever leaving NYC and the job was waiting for me once I moved. For you, I'd recommend putting together your resume and use your girlfriend's address to apply for jobs. If you start getting interviews, line them up so that you can drive to your GFs place and spend a few days there and then interview at all the places. If a prospective employer asks, tell them that you're making a big life change and you're looking for new opportunities. You'll work hard and you can start as soon as possible. Your eagerness and hustle (I hope) should help you close an offer.  What kind of jobs could someone with my experience (and age) be fully qualified, semi-qualified, or just qualified enough for?  To be honest, not a lot. But work on your resume, highlight your work ethic, and you might be able to get a job working entry level retail, life guard, dishwasher/cook, etc. Honestly, if you enjoy cooking, it might make sense to apply for restaurant jobs in the area your GF is. If you're in a major city like NYC, SF, LA, Chicago, etc., you could land an entry level job as a dishwasher or a line cook and make your way up. That would be solid career growth.  What can I expect? It's going to be rough. You're out of high school and you're moving for your girlfriend. So many things from your GFs responsibilities to school and new friends plus you looking for a job and probably picking up a lot of checks and bills while she's in school won't make it easy.

You only get one life, and every choice you make eliminates a vast array of other choices you could have made. Your options DO become narrower and narrower every day of your life. By passing through each door you refrain from passing through the others. Each of your steps forms a path. At the end, at your last hour, your last moment, you have no more choices; you have decided all the decisions you were to get, and now they're all behind you; right now you can die, exactly one choice.   So, the fear and uncertainty you're feeling might be related to that deep awareness. It happens to many people. Unfortunately, some of them respond by choosing to try to stand still. You can't actually stand still, of course. You can only refuse to go someplace new. That's generally not helpful.   You have to pick a path. You have to make the best decisions you can with the information available to you at the time.   That's the answer to your question in the title.   In your comments you asked about not getting tied in. Getting stuck in a specialized role is generally about the salary. It hurts to take a massive pay cut, to start over in a new field.

Rather than dive deep on ad sales businesses, I would actually look at the competitive landscape for this company. For example, if you're interviewing at People Magazine, what is US weekly doing or Conde Nast or even Buzzfeed? Ad sales is changing and print is dying so what insights can you share on how different publishers are using ads and engaging with advertisers? Pro Tip: Native advertising is a really fascinating thing right now and how might your magazine incorporate native advertising? Or, flip side, is native advertising really bad and is traditional advertising better? Why or why not? Think about these questions as you prepare.  Custom presentations for who? I can ask the interviewer, but I'd like to have something intelligent to say. Think about presentations for the potential ad prospects (e.g. Johnson and Johnson, Warner Bros, etc.) and for your bosses. Do you have any experience with Photoshop to make your own edits to pictures to put into a deck or will you always need a design resource to help you? The more you can do yourself the more you'll stand out. Also, what analytical skills do you have? Ever take an economics class or finance class so you understand how pricing models for ads might work? Are you familiar with Excel or will you need an analyst to help you out.  What kinds of challenges face the marketing departments of print and digital magazines? Usually resources and a constantly changing landscape. MAybe 20 years ago, you only had big players (e.g. New York Times, Entertainment Weekly, Vogue, etc.) now anyone can make something insanely popular and get a huge audience (e.g. Elite Daily, Upvote, Buzzfeed, The Skimm, etc.). What are your thoughts on this movement? What do you think this company is missing that other companies are doing well?   Overall, an internship like this will want to know that you know their content, you have good work ethic, and you're fun to work with. When I got an internship at a top tier entertainment company, I found out that it mostly came down to the fact that the editorial team felt they could hang out with me and that I flew out for the interview so they knew I really wanted the intership and I would do a lot to get it.

careerguidance,3e11se,giantcaterpillar,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:23:07 2015 UTC,why should it be bad. Most employers know where you are currently working/worked and can start digging.
careerguidance,3e11se,Nautisop,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:28:27 2015 UTC,"Is this a legitimate concern? Yes. There will be a chance they talk beforehand, and if you do get the job, then they will definitely talk. My former boss at one startup went to business school with my potential hiring manager at another startups. Once I got the job and accepted, the two exchanged emails back and forth. Thankfully, both were friends and professional so it wasn't awkward after, but during negotiations and my exit interview, I did have to explain and it was uncomfortable.  Would it be rude of them to tell my current company about my application? Yes. I would be surprised if, while you were interviewing, your new hiring manager brought it up. To prevent this, I would explicitly say that you know that your new hiring manager and your current boss might talk and that you'd prefer to keep your interest in this new company a secret for now. You can go into detail about how you care about your relationship with your current boss and don't want to burn bridges but at the same time you're looking for new opportunities that challenge you or something like that. Basically, you ask for privacy and give a valid reason why you appreciate they acknowledge your request.  Is it tacky for me to go behind my company's back and apply to a startup that they know pretty well?  No. Not tacky at all. You have to watch out for your own career path, and if you feel this new company (or some other company down the line) will give you more opportunity or responsibility, then you have to follow that. I've done four startups now over the years, and each time I've left, I've ended on good terms with my former employers because no one will fault you if you're moving on because there's a huge opportunity for you to grow at your next company."
careerguidance,3dz3ty,GigaPat,4,Mon Jul 20 18:27:26 2015 UTC,"Maybe, it depends.  Is your old role a dead end?  Does the new role offer more opportunity for growth?  Can you simply negotiate a better starting salary for the new position?"
careerguidance,3dz3ty,merreborn,3,Mon Jul 20 18:59:12 2015 UTC,"This.  I'd take a job for less pay if it meant I could be moving up in the next couple of years. At the same time, I wouldn't take a job that paid a lot more if it meant it was a deadend job."

Changing positions would actually put me on a career path while the current role is more of a job. I'm a supervisor in my current role but unless there was some movement at the top and a managerial position opened (unlikely as the managers above me have been at the company for 5+ years), I'm as high as I could go."
careerguidance,3dz3ty,pface,3,Mon Jul 20 21:53:13 2015 UTC,"If the difference in pay is truly what you described, to me it is a no brainer to move on to more growth. If we were talking 45k versus 65k, then I would have to give a pause, but with the salary being so close to each other, I'd move on.   I feel that growth is a very long term goal that is hard to focus on. The allure of a good wage can sometimes make you want to stay put longer than you should."
careerguidance,3dz3ty,jennerality,2,Mon Jul 20 22:53:23 2015 UTC,"Just want to mention two things:   There's more to this question than money vs. room for growth.  Also think about the work you do/will be doing, and the people/management you'll work with/under -- if you end up being given unsolvable problems by a micromanaging boss next to a coworker who continually eats pickled herrings at their desk, you'll come to detest it.   You have room to negotiate. You're a known quantity for the company, which puts you at an advantage, and you have organizational knowledge (i.e. you know who to call to ask questions/fix things).  If you're upfront that you're excited about the position and convincing that you're a good fit, but are considering not taking the position because of the pay cut, they may throw you a bone. If they won't budge on cash, you can try to get more vacation time or free training/tuition reimbursement."
careerguidance,3dz3ty,MSCantrell,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:33:56 2015 UTC,"With the information you gave us, I would say go for it.

careerguidance,3dz3gv,Dazednconfused--,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:24:45 2015 UTC,"I'm not an economist, but no one has answered so I can tell you what I know. My BF is a research economist focused on macroeconomics, economic policy and trade.  His primary work is writing research papers in economics. He travels a lot, most often in the US, occasionally (maybe 2x a year) to Europe. He has colleagues that work at global policy organizations, and they travel a LOT, not always to nice places. If you want to go all the way, it's a good job, professorships and policy jobs are well-paid relative to other fields and jobs can be found.    But, I know several other people who got B.S. in economics, who got entry-level corporate jobs and eventually went into finance-type positions. There is also the possibility of going into the public sector, as almost every agency you can think of has an economics section. Be aware that almost all serious jobs will require you to get a master's or MBA (as many white-collar jobs these days).   There are many different sub-fields in economics -- micro, macro, econometrics, banking, transportation, environmental.  You don't have to know what kind you want to go into during your bachelor's, that's often something that you figure out during your graduate work, but something to keep in mind.   Based on my conversations with the research economists and the finance guys, these are the skills that are most important:   Math -- you'll never make it without math Computer skills -- will depend greatly on what kind of economist you become, but I get the impression that many tasks require you to be able to use the computer to do your bidding, whether it's coding a model or mastering pivot tables.  Networking skills -- important in any field, but since I get the impression that economics tends to attract more than it's fair share of introverts and jerks, being able to get along with people is considered especially valuable. Presentation & writing skills -- whether you're presenting quarterly performance before the board or giving a seminar on your research, being able to create a concise, engaging presentation, and tailor it to your audience can seriously affect your upward mobility.

That is, we've all seen people in the work world at different points on the useless <-> indispensable scale. Some people are just keeping a chair warm, and some people are doing whatever it is that counts (bringing in money, solving the problem, moving the pile). Not right away, but eventually, the money goes to those people. They're valuable. People who have money and want something else (more money, a problem solved, a pile moved), they see the valuable guy and go, ""I bet I could get what I'm after if I paid him.""  And that's been a real helpful lens for me as I think about what skills to work on, how to describe myself, how to approach work that I don't like, and basically all kinds of work decisions. How can I become more valuable here?"
careerguidance,3dxoj6,MSCantrell,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:52:51 2015 UTC,"Ah.  Now that's a harder question.

""People don't give you their money because you want them to, they give you their money because they want to!"" - This is a really good way to look at it. However in the first reply ""Don't be good at something, create value"", surely I have to be good at something in order to create that value? When I said I was at the bottom of the pile was in reference to my retail job. I'm just a retail advisor/sales assistant/sales associate, which ever you wish. I have so many skills and own experience that I can't seem to impress with a potential employer with. All the feedback I get from interviews and applications is that ""I'm not suited for the role"", so why bother asking me for an interview if they fully well know from reading my CV/resume that I'm not suitable for the role?"

I have so many skills and own experience that I can't seem to impress with a potential employer with.   Perhaps this is the break in the flow? This is where it goes wrong? A smart guy once told me the best advice he ever got was, ""You may think you're in the chicken business, son, but you're not. You're in the people business.""   That might sound funny out of context, but he managed a division at Tyson Meats. He knew a helluva lot about chicken. But his mentor was telling him, it doesn't matter what you know, or have, or know how to do... if nobody's willing to pay you for it. And the reason people might not be willing to pay for what you're offering (in your case, OP, I'm talking about your skills and experience) might have less to do with the quality of the skills and experience, and more to do with the personal connection that has to happen for a money/skills exchange to take place.   I'm saying your skills and experience might be just fine, but the interpersonal work involved in making a deal to sell those skills and that experience, that's what's tripping you up.

This will also allow you to make connections to publicists who want you to cover their bands. You can reach out to them, but I promise once you start posting, they will reach out to you and ask you to cover shows. Go to anything and everything at first and then start being more discerning.

Go buy (or read online if you're not old school) a magazine, newspaper (denver post), etc with a bunch of articles in them about companies you'd want to work for.  Pick your top 5 companies you want to work for. Hopefully they have less than 100 people. Linkedin stalk them. Learn everything you can about the company. Figure out who manages marketing for them.  Research their social media and other marketing channels. Come up with 10 ideas on how to improve, start, or change their marketing efforts. Right a blog post on 4-5 of them. Make them the best posts on the internet about those 4-5 ideas. Make it so they don't even have to hire you to implement them, they are that detailed. Send the blog posts over to the head of marketing for each company. Tell them you'd like to work for them (subtly) because of x, y, z. Ask if they'd have time to give you some quick feedback on A. (When you want a job ask for advice, when you want advice, ask for a job). Then say, you think it could be improved in three ways. 1, 2, 3. You think 3 is the best because of G. Ask if this is a good idea. The point of this really is to get advice, not a job. Advice = experience you can talk about in a job interview. If they say no, repeat process, but then post to inbound.org. Wait a couple weeks, then post to inbound.org saying you'd like feedback on what you don't know and mention you're looking for jobs.

careerguidance,3dwm2l,1harmonics,2,Mon Jul 20 03:32:57 2015 UTC,"Here's my take on this and keep in mind this is only my experience and opinion. You can go for a CPSM (or whatever the APICS equivalent is), its not terribly difficult but also doesn't gain a whole lot (it does require 3 years of experience + college degree to get the title).  Its a good starting and will certainly put you ahead of many others.  More importantly, make sure you have a 4 year college degree - it probably doesn't matter what it is as long as you can say why it helps your career in SCM.  From what I've seen, big companies have you focus more on contract management.  Typically you aren't out landing big deals, that's usually done at a higher level. Also, whats important is knowing the ERP software that the company uses, for example SAP.  Most older managers are not as familiar with how to use the software fully and its easy to find a niche in being the guy who can report and interpret spend data quickly. Need to know excel well.

He said it worked pretty well for getting jobs in small and inexperienced startups but wouldn't recommend it if you're applying in a more corporate environment.  I finally decided that this town was not worth it and i ended up sending resume in a smaller town (still second biggest town in the area) that does not require bilingualism and i started getting interviews right away.

Long story short people like honest people that admit fault, learn from it, and move forward.

It sucks but find someone that hasn't had it happen in some way, shape or form.  I would include the job on a resume.  Use a co-worker that you liked as your reference and not the person that fired you.  Most new employers will ask which past workplaces you would like them to contact and also ask for references separately.

It might be easy for you now but you'd be setting yourself up for a hard time (physically) in the next 15 or 20 years. At 50 with bad knees you'd be hard-pressed to find a position you could do in a warehouse.  Your parents might be right. For the short term- you need a job in order to pay your rent. However, try to keep your long term goals in mind. Look at how a job now might set you up for a career in the future. Your customer service experience points to retail so you might start looking there. With a degree and ten years of customer service experience, you might be able to get into management if you can market yourself correctly. You could use that experience to work the supply side of retail and move up in that field.

You mentioned no rollover of vacation in the private column, as a GS both your vacation and sick time rolls over every year up to a certain amount. I believe it's 60 days now.  Lots of travel expenses can be covered, there are tax breaks and reimbursements associated with buying property when accepting a federal position outside of your current local area. The retirement system is actually pretty nice, maybe not the best but still rather good.  Of course you get all the federal holidays off, and you can combine vacation days with them to take extended weekends. Most locations have a Flex-schedule program, where you can work 4x10 and have 3 days off, or work 5x9,4x9 and have one extra day off each pay period.  You can also be authorized overtime if your base/agency has the money for it. GS pay is an oddity in that you have a salary, but you are actually hourly and receive overtime compensation commensurate with that.

careerguidance,3dn8ex,wallymolly,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:22:16 2015 UTC,I think adding a minor or double major is often a good idea. All of your options are interesting.  I would pick Marketing. It is the best fit for the marketing/PR work you have in mind and it fits nicely with the Media Production major. Should help with sales oriented opportunities as well as anything in the advertising industry.   Good luck.
careerguidance,3dn8ex,Shellcode,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:46:46 2015 UTC,"Media production person here. Definitely marketing. Companies are looking to hire people who can do every aspect of a production themselves and your major looks like it will do a decent job of covering that. But a lot of these job opportunities are going to be ""preditor"" deals and depending on the area, the job will probably be selling things to people.  Entertaining TV shows are nice, but commercials are the reason they exist.  Also, not to be Debbie Downer, but the internet is doing to TV what TV did to newspapers. Marketing spans medium and is a strong industry to fall back on when TV starts going belly-up before you can retire."

careerguidance,3dlqcb,eastcoastk,3,Fri Jul 17 08:03:21 2015 UTC,"To start, I know someone who did what you do and made a whole hell of a lot more, so the difference between $35 and $40 is negligible compared to what you could be making.  In my city, you can't get doggy daycare for even $50/day for two dogs, and dog walkers charge >$30 per walk.   It's very awkward to ask for a raise, so it's easy (especially for us women) to fall into that one-octave-higher ""Pretty please?"" tone when asking for more money.   But now it is a little more trouble for me to commit so much time to these two dogs and I think slightly raising the price to at least a little closer to the standard rate would make me feel better about the time I am going to put into this...do you think a raise from 20 dollars a day to 35 would work with you   It seems like you're begging this woman to pay you more. Use your backbone -- you're running a business, and your client is robbing you blind. You deserve more, you don't owe her an explanation of why you're charging more, and, frankly, she probably doesn't care.  She won't like paying more no matter how you cut it, so trying to dance around it with the words I bolded is pointless.  Just tell her what your new price is. You have her by the short hairs as much as she does you, since firing you and hiring someone else is going to cause her a whole lot of headache, especially when she realizes that no one will do it for even $40/day.  Tell her, ""Hi Mrs. Moneybags, beginning next Monday, my rates will be $40/day."" If she says anything, say ""I know you're a family friend and I love your dogs, but since I've started working with a professional dog walking company I've realized that my rates here are too far below market value. Don't worry, $40 is still lower than fair market value.""   What you neglected to think about is what she's going to say after you give your schpeal. I don't know her, but she may be fine with it, or she may complain and try to manipulate you into a lower price, or she may try to negotiate.    If she starts in on you, remember to stay calm. Breathe. Don't raise your voice.  Be empathetic, but don't budge:    ""I really like the arrangement that we have"" ""I know (shake head at what a pity it is that she's losing the arrangement she had)""  ""This is just really unexpected."" ""I realize that you weren't expecting this.""   ""Are you unhappy here?"" ""I'm very happy here and I love spending time with your dogs, but I think I deserve to be paid fairly for the work I do for them."" ""I'm not sure I can manage $40/day (which you know is BS)""  ""I see.""  (Call her bluff with caution) ""In that case, let me know by Friday if you've decided I shouldn't come on Monday.""       She may try to negotiate, so decide before you go in whether you're willing to accept and offer of $35 or $30.    Remember: it's not personal, it's just business."

Which is understandable, it's a harsh feeling to have a rate doubled on you. She said she won't go double, and told me to ""think about it"" and we'll continue the conversation/talk about it tomorrow.   Thing is, all things considered for the job I'm doing, $200 is extremely reasonable for the job I'm doing. In fact, it's still way below market price. My fatal flaw was asking for so little in the beginning, which I will definitely watch out for in the future. It's that jump that deters her so much I know, cause if you put it into perspective, I'm not sure where or how she could expect to pay less than 200 given any other situation.

Decision making: Adjusters get a very solid amount of autonomy, so that your files are YOUR files. Your responsibility, your decision.  Managing or coordinating: At the beginning, you've got to wrangle all the people I've already named. If you want to advance, advancing into management is the natural path.  Technical skills: You'll need need to learn lots of medical terminology, some law (both state law about accidents and treatment, and a like-the-back-of-my-hand familiarity with the insurance contract you're operating under), and a decent level of how cars work and the physics of what happens when they hit each other.  Creativity: All of the above is COMPLEX. Pulling it all together into an accurate, fair, readable file that will pass audit is like ballet.    Not many people are looking for high-stress jobs, so adjusters are always in moderate demand.

careerguidance,3diyw9,KzaPs,3,Thu Jul 16 17:28:52 2015 UTC,"Canadian trained general surgeon here. I can answer some of the medical questions. First, be VERY careful of going for an international medical degree if you plan to return to Canada for either residency or work. Even if you are a Canadian citizen, you return as an international medical graduate (IMG) and there are EXTREMELY strict quotas on the number of IMG residency positions in Canada, especially if you are wanting to become a specialist. They are also very competitive - in my residency we offered one IMG spot a year and regularly had over 300 applicants. You will also have a number of hoops to jump through including writing the MCCQE exams, applying through CARMs and will probably have a return of service agreement. You will likely have very little choice in where you do your residency and may be required to work in an under serviced (read: small town) area for several years after completion. Check out the CARMs FAQs for IMGs here:http://www.carms.ca/en/match-process/faqs/imgs/. Note that paying med school fees as an international student adds up quickly. You will spend lots of time paying those off unless you are independently wealthy. As for speciality choice, this is usually made during med school after seeing and shadowing different physicians. Personally, I never get bored with the problems I see as my specialty is very broad and I love the variety. You can certainly do research as any type of physician. Most docs research what they know best, but I guess there are not really any limits on what you choose to study. All fields have tremendous research opportunities. There are few paid positions between med school and residency as you are not licensed as a physician, but you may find research related positions or similar. If you are truly passionate about medicine, I suggest trying for a Canadian school. Several of my friends have lamented the fact that they went overseas as there is such a struggle to return. It is not impossible, just very difficult. Best of luck with your decision."

I have thought about that issue of returning to Canada a good amount, and it's important to remember the difficulties studying abroad will present. Part of the reason that I chose Australia over Ireland and the Caribbean is that I can stay and perform my residency there, and after a year internship I'm told you're selected on the same level as an Aussie. If I decide upon medicine over law, and end up wanting to go into a specialty with competitive residencies I have to realize I'd likely be staying in Australia for a time after the MD(which has its benefits and downsides). If I decide to specialize in something that is not competitive I could likely return to Canada in a town that I'd get to ride a snowmobile to work most of the year (i.e. small town). Medical school tuition for out of state or internationals is very high in other countries( especially the US with their dollar atm, $91,000 CAD for some schools). I realize those loans would be with me for a while. I'm trying to avoid thinking about cost of tuition and salary in my decision or else patent law would be obvious for both.

But in a sense ""fractal evolution"" is why I want to pursue fractals in the GUT, both consciousness and the universe I think can be better understood someday through fractals, by understanding more of the chaos in the big bang maybe we could predict what produced it. It's not like I have an obsession with them, they're the most efficient way to spread something, be it the effects of a lightning strike or the evolution of life, it's how we describe maximum space efficiently and it could work over multiple dimensions. Why I say evolution probably makes sense in the sense of universal evolution, the reason why the isotope of hydrogen with just one atom is so much more common, it was able to survive easier, maybe with different physical laws atoms would have formed completely differently, maybe antimatter would be the prevailing force in the universe. I'm sure some of this doesn't make sense, as I haven't even taken physics in highschool yet, but I've got the interest! If it doesn't sound like my fractal hypothesis makes sense, let me know. Thanks."

Enjoy your life.  Since you are an introvert, I don't see why you can't get deeper into financial/business analysis.  You can also look for an actuary path - where you can make alot of money and the career is really stable.  Otherwise, just get deeper into an analysis role, switch job when the economy is good to get a 10-20% bump in salary - if money is a concern for you.  Live within your means - don't buy a house or a car that you can't afford.    Get a girlfriend/wife for god's sake and stop worry about the little things!"

Regarding your list of things you love to do, it's important to make a distinction between things you love to do and things that you are willing to put up with for money.  The outdoors are lovely, many people feel at home there, but what actual work are you willing to do there? Many jobs can be backbreaking (lumberjack), monotonous (counting/capturing wildlife), ethically challenging (environmental remediation of strip mines) or just plain demeaning (picking up dog poop on trails).  And there's stiff competition for most jobs where you work for someone else -- I'm currently pursuing an environmental science master's and many of my classmates want exactly that, and have experience & education. You may luck out, so of course, apply for whatever you see that interests you, but I can't think of any easy ""path"" to incorporating what you want to do into a full-time steady gig with benefits.   Personally, I'm a big fan of side-hustles if you don't know for sure what you want to do because it's low-risk and is an easier way to find out if you really want to monetize your passions or just leave them as hobbies.    In my area, there are some MeetUp groups that host hikes & tours for a fee. Some have tried to make a full-time career out of it, but that requires a lot of saavy and some long hours and takes a few year of building a customer base.  Likewise, you could try to hire yourself out as a bagpipe player (in my area, it's very common to have a bagpipe player at funerals), or being a wedding videographer, if you love making videos.  You can combine both, and maybe do an outdoor-focused YouTube channel. You may see if you can come up with some other great ideas."

Smaller financial risk analysis consulting firms are more likely to be interested in giving you a chance, rather than large banks. Unfortunately, these smaller firms aren't necessarily going to lead to the financial benefits you're hoping for. Just something to keep in mind.  If you seriously want to make the transition anyway, I suggest getting your FRM certification at minimum, and potentially pursuing your CFA. These will let potential employers know they don't have to teach you the finance side of things, give you a sense of whether you actually enjoy the work, and can provide job opportunities.  If you're in the DC metro area, let me know and we'll chat. (My company is usually hiring, but I would want to know you before recommending you)  Good luck!"

I did manufacturing before Bschool, then was at a start up, then a think tank before ending up in my current position, which I got through a referral. They technical interviewed me, so it was useful that I was pretty into finance in grad school, had learned to program in undergrad (but hadn't programmed since), and was pretty adept at Excel. It also helped that I had a good understanding of how the government works (they are our largest client) and proof that I could write from my think tank days. Of my ~60 coworkers, only one other has an engineering degree, though, most came from financial services or professional services firms, almost all have the CFA or have failed one of the levels. Maybe ~6 of us have an MBA, more common is a degree in Econ and/or a CFA.  As for salary, I'm probably (definitely) underpaid for my background, base is ~100k, with a 20-60% bonus. Doing similar work for a big bank would pay substantially more, but involve worse hours and is hard to get in to outside of their traditional recruiting tracks.  Definitely take the FRM and strongly consider the CFA, we recruit through both professional organizations as do our peers."

You're not the one waiting after all... you're the one attending meetings and dealing with day to day stuff.  On the other side, when you're waiting for an answer (especially if you're desperate), then 5 days feels like 1 month.  People who hire don't always realize the stress it puts on the person waiting.  People who wait, don't realize that sometimes, other things come up.  So basically my opinion is:  Standard answer from HR (at least they responded which is at least something) and anything could have come up, like a delayed interview or someone taking a few days off and will decide when they come back.

There really isn't a lot available for biology majors in healthcare. Best case scenario is that you'll end up as a lowly lab assistant (I worked in a microbiology lab for a year) and maybe you won't have to work night shift (I unfortunately did).   Here's the truth. If you want to work in healthcare then you have to get certified through some healthcare certification program. For example, once you finish your current bachelors degree, you could do an accelerated nursing program which allows you to obtain your BSN within approximately 18 months. Or you could do a medical technology program in order to become a Medical Technologist working in a hospital laboratory (which is what I wanted to do but didn't and still regret it). Either way, you won't get very far without further schooling and certification. So either pay your dues or switch industries."

At the very least museums like you to have a bachelor's in a related field to the industry for curatorial roles but it's not always necessary.  I volunteered for my local museums a few years ago and have kept in touch with the staff since. I went into tourism/events because I started assisting with the museum's event schedule and wanted to make a career out of it.  Unfortunately museum jobs are very competitive and a lot of museums operate on a skeleton staff and rely heavily on volunteers.  Without knowing your location to give you specifics my best advice for you is start volunteering with your local museums, even if it's only one day a week it's a foot in the door for you.  Half the people I know working in our museums got there by networking.   My friend started volunteering as a receptionist/tour guide on weekends. Then she got taken on as an employee to run the reception and eventually she got promoted to volunteer manager despite having no museum qualifications.  On the other hand another friend got his masters in museum studies to get into the industry but cannot get a role other than museum/curatorial assistant because of how competitive the market here is.  Another colleague started her career as a primary school teacher but got burned out with stress over the pressure. Luckily she'd befriended one of the museum managers and they managed to take her on as a casual education assistant/outreach assistant because of her teaching background.  If you have skills that they can use, you're likely to be considered based on your skills and merits not just what level of degree you hold.  Where do you live?

Also, if you are being flown back on the weekends, you essentially have one day to yourself because you typically get back on Fridays and leave Sunday morning (unless you can manage red-eye to maximize time). Even worse is if it is cheaper to keep you at your travel location, so you don't see your fiance for a month+.   Personally, I wouldn't get to hung up about it but this is coming from someone who had to travel 40%+ of the year, so 80% sounds pretty gnarly."

You want us to say nah bro, you did the right thing, and I just don't feel we can in honesty do that.   That said, who says you have to stick with that Project forever? Think carefully. Did you promise your company a year? Is there a contractual time frame you've agreed to? You should definitely fulfill anything you've given your word on, shook hands on, or contractually obligated yourself to. After that, you are free to seek out a project with travel."

Do you think your condescending supervisor will give you a good reference? Pfft. He sounds like an asshole.   Quit. Leave the job.   Another part of the career learning experience is assessing when you are in an abusive and toxic workplace, and knowing when you can leave.  I would leave. I wouldn't even list it on your resume. Next summer, hopefully you'll get better luck. You just had bad luck with a place this summer. Go to the better job with better pay.   If you need a valid reason to quit, say you have another job and you can't do both, and then just leave. I wouldn't even give 2 weeks notice.  Many older generation people think they can exploit youth and blame them for being ""lazy."" Fuck that shit. My expectation is that I have a rewarding and meaningful experience with mentorship to learn and to train. I think that's a valid expectation and your supervisor/your workplace isn't living up to that. In fact, he sounds like an asshole.   Leave."

March right up to your supervisors desk, tell him you're done, you quit, and leave. Do not let them turn you around or try to convince you otherwise.  Internships are traps. It's basically legal slavery, 'job experience' and 'resume building' are not proper compensation. Do not waste another second of your time there. See a career counselor, do whatever you have to for a new job or internship at a reputable place, but your time is irreplaceable, do not give them another minute.  You don't need to give them two weeks notice, they don't pay you. You cost them nothing, you're a source of free labor. You are well within your rights to just not show up and not even email them.

If you're asked the dreaded question about why you left your last employer/position, you don't want to give the impression you left suddenly because you thought it was shit.  If you give them an end date of a couple of weeks time and see it out until then, there will be no difficulty in the future, you can just say if asked that you worked to your end date.   If asked why you didn't do your internship until the end of summer either just say your end date was before the end of summer or you worked your notice for some 'job interview reason' like ""while I appreciated the experience I gathered there, I made the positive decision to pursue other things that I felt were more relevant to blah blah blah interviewschminterview..."""

The calculation is up to you.   Also, I truly believe that your situation is awful and unreasonable, but.... It is only a few more weeks and it isn't exactly being a Syrian war refugee.

You'd be in the same situation you are in now where you can't advertise the job in either scenarios. Arguably, you'd be worse off if she never told you in advanced as the information she gave you is actionable (i.e. you can tap your professional network to see if there is a potential replacement and when the job opens up, they can apply formally).   The only difference between your scenario and her just telling you at the end of the month is that she showed a level of comfort and trust with you to share the details.  Personally, I would not feel disrespected because she could have easily just not said anything and put in her two weeks.

A couple of months in to my first job (I was 21 as well, so older than you) I overslept and so was late, maybe an hour, an hour and a half. It's not quite the same because to a degree, it didn't matter an awful lot, it just meant my colleagues might be a but grumpy, it wasn't a shift thing where there would be nobody to do the job, getting in and going home times are flexible, come in late, go home late, that sort of thing.  But I still woke up, almost pooped my pants, phoned my dad (??) and asked him what I should do because I would be late, and pretty much freaked out. As it turned out, nobody cared and if it happened again now I wouldn't be that bothered, I'd just apologise to my colleagues, as long as it's not a habit, it's not a problem.  I'm writing this just to tell you that for me, it was probably even LESS important than it was for you and I was 7 years older and I still had a fit about it. I know how you feel but as long as it's a one-off really really don't worry.

So I quit and went to a vendor. That was terrible, and I came back to my original field, but as a self-employed consultant.   That sounds like where you'll be going, right? You'll be a self-employed independent contractor? Getting paid on a 1099?   That's a good place to start. There has been much ink spent on how to work as a 1099 contractor effectively, striking a balance between burning yourself out and starving. ""1099 contractor"" is a good search term to start with.  I miss it, and I hope I'll be able to go back soon.   Cons:   When the work is slow, they don't even have to apologize for not paying you. Your hours, pay, and even your whole job are subject to cutting without notice. Your taxes are higher AT LEAST by the amount of the Social Security part and Self Employment Tax, probably other things.  You'll generally be an outsider to the company. You don't get invited to the picnic, you don't get to ask the secretary to fax something for you, you're not welcome in the supplies cabinet. You've got to take all that extra money and spend it on taxes, benefits, supplies, and equipment.   Pros:   Since they're not paying you in perks, they'll pay you in money. It equals out, roughly, but I like controlling how that benefits/equipment money is spent. Unlimited unpaid time off. Or, conversely, almost unlimited money.  Some control over your workload. If you've got too much to do, you can just say, ""No thanks"" to new assignments. (This depends on your circumstances and your relationships.) No barrier to moonlighting/working on the side."

When they ask your ""salary expectations"" shoot high.  Since you're on the low end at your current firm, shoot to where you think you should be, then add 10%.  Especially if their benefits suck, then it means that you can try and leverage that in to more money as well.  You have a job, you don't need to settle, and if they don't meet you where you want to be, then forget it!  2) NO.  Do not inform your employer about this at all.  If you do, they may believe you're looking to jump ship, in which case your position will be worse off, or they may even start looking for a replacement for you.  I'd only consider asking for a match once there is an offer on the table that you can accept from the prospective employer.

I find that if you demonstrate even a slightly higher than average ability with Microsoft Excel for handling data, graphs and making spreadsheets for calculations, people will really respond very well.   So my number 1 suggestion would be Excel. Even stuff that is relatively simple looks impressive to people who are no good at it and if you use it to make a task simpler or more efficient, it makes you look really good.  Edit: Sorry I only read your title but now I see you said about Excel. As Lebrobro_James said, the Office package in general is ubiquitous, getting better at all of it is only ever a good thing. It's amazing how impressed people can be if you make a decent powerpoint and they are no good at it.

For sheer interest I would have done a 'General Studies' degree if such a thing existed (we don't do the whole 'Liberal Arts' thing here). Right up until I sent my university application I was tossing up whether to do History, English literature or Biology. I chose Biology and now I'm a scientist.  I feel like I'd like to write a novel, I feel like maybe I should have pursued my military reserve experience and become a regular officer, sometimes I feel like my sense of morality really means I should try to be a policeman. Until a matter of months before I graduated I was set on being a primary (elementary) school teacher.  I'll probably wake up in 40 years, close to retirement and think ""oh... well looks like I'm not going to be an army officer OR a policeman... maybe some day I'll still write a novel.""  I'm not a guy who has ever had a dream, I like learning about everything superficially and a few things in depth and those things aren't very related. I just figured I can keep literature and history as an engrossing hobby more than with biology, and I still do. I had to have a reason to pick one of them so that was it.  Basically, and I know this is cheesy but, don't worry. In 4 years or whatever when you've finished your degree you'll wonder how you were sitting in school just yesterday and today you're graduating anyway.   Don't buy the hype and romantic ideas about a dream and a calling if it's just not you. It's not me that's for sure.  If you can wring any advice out of this it's that maybe choose the most vocational of your interests, assured in the knowledge that you can always study anything else at leisure.

You'll learn more in your first year of employment than you ever did at university. What they want to see is your passion and integrity - one great way of showing that is with good grades, but there are other great ways.  I honestly think the thing that carried the most weight when I got my first job was I scored perfectly on a mechanical aptitude test (as did everyone else in my department). My transcript was something that seemed to get looked at only insofar as it showed that my degree was legit - tick that box and move on, kind of thing. I had a full year of marks with an average of I think 52 (out of 100, where 49 is a fail). Granted I got my shit together for final year exams, but my transcript paints a very poor picture of me.  But the one thing it does say is huge: I graduated. I fucking finished it. That's no small feat, and it can't be taken away or undone. Don't be too quick to denounce yourself or your degree - it's a fucking DEGREE. They simply wouldn't give it to you if you hadn't earned it. Yes, you'd be going up against people with better marks, but you'd be absolutely in the same category as them: degree qualified.  It's one of those things where if you talk yourself down, people will believe you.

I graduated with an absolutely lousy 2.6gpa but had all kinds of leadership positions and accomplishments. I spent a little less than one year out of college working for a company who did outsourced accounting for hedge funds, working fairly long hours for very little pay. When I realized that that hedge fund accounting wasn't for me, I reached out to my network and was able to secure a role as a corporate strategy analyst making over 70k/year and loving everything I do.  As long as you have a decent network, you'll be fine. For me I think the 1 year buffer after college both made my GPA less of a consideration, and gave me some experience that may be valuable to other employers.   You'll figure something out, even if your first job isn't exactly what you want to be doing, it'll begin paving the way."

YMMV  I found that turnover is high in data centers and hosting companies and both are almost always hiring for network and Linux administrators. The ones I have worked for typically are on the lower end of pay (40-50k) but have decent benefits and perks (free lunch, game rooms, gyms, etc.). The real benefit is the exposure to lots of similar professionals and with the high turnover rate it will not be long before your professional network consists of people working at Google, Amazon, IBM and others."

careerguidance,3d304i,alogon3,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:15:55 2015 UTC,"Honestly, your best bet is going to be to pick one path and take it to the end. You are going to be able to get a much higher salary and better hours by being the guru of one area instead of a jack of all trades.   Since you already have a few Cisco certs, I would recommend finding a job at a data center or ISP and then working to get the highest Cisco cert you can (CCNP/CCIE).  One nice part about networking jobs is they are difficult to outsource, Windows and Linux administration jobs are typically done using RDP or SSH which makes them much easier to offshore.  The LPIC-1 Exam Objectives would be good if you intend to be a network guy but want to be able to prove some Linux knowledge. If you want to pursue Linux administration as a career then I would skip it and go for the RHCSE and RHCE certs.  The Windows certificates are the same situation, if you want to be able to prove you have some Windows knowledge then the lower level sever certs could work. Note that Windows careers less common in the data center and found more in corporations with smaller IT budgets and networking needs."
careerguidance,3d2ok4,spossinger13,2,Mon Jul 13 01:16:03 2015 UTC,"I went back to school for a degree in Engineering.  It was an incredible amount of work, absolutely incredible.  On top of that I worked full time.  I had no social life for 6 years as I transitioned from a car salesman to an engineer.  I am more respected now, not from my peers but from the public.  There is a certain prestige with being an engineer (although most people now days are to stupid to even know what an engineer is).  My job is pretty boring.  I produce instrumentation drawings for a refinery.  My actual job isnt that bad, its dealing with the quagmire of red tape in administration at the refinery that sucks.  I work for a consulting firm who's main goal is to pay me as little as possible.  Career wise I can pull down six figs, but I have to be ready to move almost anywhere in the world and work 60 hours (AVG) a week.  Was it worth it?  Right now I say no.  But I have a feeling in ten years when im 45 and even more tired then now I will have a different opinion, as if I wanted to kiss ass and whisper in rooms about the people I work with I could realistically not do much in a day except wait to go home.  Mechanical Engineer 3 credits left to graduate.  3 years in the oil business.  I miss selling cars, it just doesnt pay well in the new economy.

My spouse is deployed 9 months out of the year.  I am worried that when he goes to use his G.I. bill I won't be making enough to support us.

My job is so soul crushing so I have to make a change but I feel like my first passion, which is to be a doctor would take too much time at this point in my life. So I was thinking of biomedical engineering. The major move for this would be so I could have the financial ability to build a family and support my immediate since my fathers passing. So I don't know what I'm going to do but I have to get out of my current situation immediately. I make 70k a year but it will never be more and there's advancement means even less money.

A good company will put you in touch with a manager or some potential coworkers, who can explain what it takes to advance, and how they train for new responsibilities, or at least how they recognize and encourage you to take more on. This absolutely need to be part of your conversation during the interview process.   Sometimes, it's worth it to take a lower title/official role, provided you are confident you can quickly advance to a more challenging or fulfilling one.

careerguidance,3d11ws,apymir,3,Sun Jul 12 17:10:06 2015 UTC,"So I just finished my phd (political science) and am leaving academia for a while. I received an academic offer but for family reasons decided a stint in consulting was better. I think there are a few things that a number of my colleagues have done and encouraged me to do that were helpful. We all developed skills in data analysis, many wrote op eds or blogged on issues they had expertise in, had lots of practice teaching and presenting to diverse audiences, and participating in outside activities. I think the ability to communicate with non experts, a wide network of people who want to support us, and transferable skills all have helped us leave academia successfully."
careerguidance,3d11ws,calicliche,2,Sun Jul 12 18:49:55 2015 UTC,"How do you obtain the network of people? I am doing a PhD on a theoretical project and work only with my supervisor and, very rarely, with a young postdoc."
careerguidance,3d11ws,krappa,3,Sun Jul 12 19:10:36 2015 UTC,"Doing other things I enjoy is how I did it: I was active in my church, did rec sports one evening a week,  etc. I have friends who joined meet up groups or volunteered to expand their networks. When I was too busy I eased up on that stuff, but made sure to occasionally send a text or email or grab a drink with those people to maintain relationships. I think it's good too because you need to get out of your grad school bubble sometimes to be a well rounded person. I also joined our consulting club on campus when I decoded I wanted to open that option. That decision I made about the time I first applied to consulting firms, but I should have done it maybe 6 months before I applied. So it doesn't all have to occur for the whole duration of the phd.   I will say I didn't do this stuff much my first two years of grad school. They were too intense, but once my schedule became more my own, I made the commitment to myself to build out my network. It helped keep some perspective that there is a life outside the ivory tower that many of my colleagues in the department seemed to have lost. With a science degree you'll probably have even more marketable skills, but possibly less emphasis on work life balance than in my field, so this could be more difficult for you, I'm not sure."

I am an introvert as well, and scaling back on the social activities was eventually necessary to not lose my mind. The things that made the cut were ones that I actually cared about and enjoyed. I think the fact that the relationships I developed weren't just transactional, but several have been really instrumental in helping me find my way to my new job. I would also try to meet other people in your program. If your PhD doesn't involve coursework then that's probably harder, but cultivating that network of peers is really important if you do go academic because you can, to some extent, help each other along through future collaborations or just cross-citation."

careerguidance,3d216r,xxredvirusxx,2,Sun Jul 12 21:58:32 2015 UTC,"Science degrees (bio, chem, phys, etc.) are tough because in the field having an advanced degree is pretty much a requirement. To be frank, you won't get very far with a bachelor's unless you want to work as a lab tech or maybe an operator in industry (neither of which pay particularly well). In terms of career opportunities, computer related is probably your best bet. Doesn't have to be comp sci, every company needs IT workers.

careerguidance,3d216r,byoomba,1 point,Mon Jul 13 12:35:06 2015 UTC,"You're right, I should have worded my response differently. It is possible to become a scientist without grad school, but like you said you'll probably start in a tech position and have to work your way up, and it'll be uphill vs people with more advanced degrees. Congrats on getting your position though, sounds like something you enjoy! Honestly I'm not a lab person at all, I can't stand doing research so I'm not really an expert on scientist positions. But OP is 24 and still looking at ~2.5-3 years of school before getting his degree so I was looking more at immediate job possibilities."
careerguidance,3d216r,Saxon2060,2,Mon Jul 13 12:53:19 2015 UTC,"Thanks.  I thought I would like labs and I feel, as much as it bored me after a while, I benefited from being at the bench for a while. It's not interesting for very long, though.  Yeah, as you said I suppose it depends whether time is of the essence. If it's something OP really wants to do, I'd say the best way is to do a science degree with a year in industry as part of the course, which is widely offered by UK universities, I suppose I couldn't speak for other countries. If you manage to get a placement, it's very likely you will end up there after you graduate in a graduate position. Even far more likely than if you do a post grad degree.  Also, I don't know if I'll enjoy it yet! As I said my degree is biology and my first scientist role is looking after part of the process which isn't very biological at all. That's what I like about industry though, you're expected to move around and gather broad understanding of processes and people and science that you can apply all over, not dedicate your life to toads' kidneys or a rare Uzbekistani fungus.  Edit: Also, British people tend to be coy talking about money and salary so I don't know if I'm being crass but considering we're talking careers:  I don't know what you would consider ""good"" money, it's all subjective but as a lab tech my basic was about $33,000 gross plus overtime (I ended up with around $38,000 gross.) My very first scientist job is around $46,600 gross. Both of those figures for lab tech and scientist are very entry level because I am young with little experience. In the UK those salaries are decent but not huge. I'd say very satisfactory for someone in their 20s. ($38,000 is pretty much bang on national average salary.)"
careerguidance,3d216r,Saxon2060,1 point,Mon Jul 13 13:45:02 2015 UTC,"EDIT: I am from, studied and work in the UK but the company I work for is very much American so I think this is still relevant.  I have a bachelor's degree in Biology (in the UK). Gone are the days when I could start pretty much anywhere as a scientist straight after graduating. However, it is worth bearing in mind that, here at least, for a scientist role at somewhere like a pharma plant (think tech support/process development, true research would require a Phd.) the minimum qualification I always see advertised is a BSc.  I used to get very demoralised because I didn't want to go back to university to do a post grad, I'm interested in industrial science anyway, not academia. I sometimes felt especially demoralised because my first job after university was as a lab tech in a pharma plant. They tend to take lab techs with degrees. I had to remind myself ""at least it's a job in science"" and try to raise my profile. Work with scientists, get involved with projects, show willing.  I've recently applied for an internal position as a scientist and got it. I wouldn't (legally I think, 'qualified' people are a requirement in certain roles) have got it if I didn't have a degree. It was an absolute requirement.  So there's a little pre-amble and I'll try to sum up in a way that I hope is relevant to you.  Do you require a BSc. to be a scientist in industry? Yes  Do you require postgraduate qualifications to be a scientist in industry? NO.  Will it be harder with 'only' a BSc.? Maybe. Scientists I've spoken to about career concerns at my company have said post grad quals may differentiate you from the other guy but they are NOT a requirement and how well you are suited to working in industry and with people matter more.  The very very best shortcut by a million miles that I see is doing a degree with a year in industry. Places are competitive but my site takes on one student every year and almost invariably they come back to work here as a scientist straight away which grinds my gears but I wish I'd done the same to skip the lab tech bit. But lab tech in big pharma pays okay and is not stressful at all so I didn't hate it. It's easy for the money.  Is it possible to be a scientist with 'only' a BSc.? Yes But you might have to start in a role a little more humble than you hoped and try to stand out.  (Background: 25 years old, BSc. (Hons.) Biology, no real work experience at all except military reserve officer training, worked as a lab technician for ~3.5 years at one of the big global pharma companies while applying internally for scientist jobs before I scored one.)  Hope this is useful. If you're interested in industrial science, feel free to pm me.   EDIT: I should mention, this only applies to biology, of the degrees you listed as interesting. Obviously environmental and earth sciences don't apply here. My girlfriend works in that sort of industry but they are probably harder to compare between the US and UK.  EDIT (again): Since you're asking if something is 'worth it', I don't know if it's crass but I'll add earnings:  I don't know what you would consider ""good"" money, it's all subjective but as a lab tech my basic was about $33,000 gross plus overtime (I ended up with around $38,000 gross.) My very first scientist job is around $46,600 gross. Both of those figures for lab tech and scientist are very entry level because I am young with little experience.

It can be a difficult field to break into.  In this area of the country small pilots and crop dusters do pretty well.  That might be an option if you really want to fly.
careerguidance,3cwrm2,Kolfinna,3,Sat Jul 11 15:52:15 2015 UTC,"I'm open to small plane flying like that. Hell, I might prefer it. I hear from a lot of pilots that they enjoy charter and cargo flying more than airlines, because the airlines are ruled by seniority."

The faster you can do it, the cheaper it is in the long run, but the more money you need up front.  Flight hours are costly.    Then you have your multiple certifications: multi-engine, commercial, etc.  You will need massive student loans, like $200,000.    My friend just went commercial.  It took her 10 years of flying and flight instructing (the flight instructing is a good way to get access to cheap planes, only pay fuel costs) and some private pilot stuff.    She waitressed for most of it, to be able to pay the bills.   She finally got hired by an airline, for like $18,000.  Second year pay is like $34,000.    She needed many loans from family for first two years (they were both ""first year pay"" at different airlines) to support herself.  She, like many commercial pilots, was homeless, etc.  My brother was a Navy pilot.  20 years in, just retired, looking for Commercial jobs.  His friends are going 50/50 regional/major.    If this is a passion of yours, do it, 30 is still plenty of time, but you need to be realistic about the slow trajectory and do a shitload of research on pilot boards.    Do you have any family support?"

Out of high school my grades weren't good enough for the Air Force Academy, and you need college credits to be a pilot. Getting a Med-40 discharge from the Army has, for all intents and purposes, completely shut down the idea of ever joining again, because it's nigh impossible to be accepted by the military after that. It was honorable and all that, but now that the government sends me a check every month it's not going to welcome me back with open arms.  I have no financial support from family available, in any way, shape or form. I wish I did, I really do, but everyone in my family is either broke or not interested in fronting me a large sum of money. I'm on my own.  With that said, flying isn't the only career I'd accept. I have frequently considered going into IT, since they make a lot of money, are in high demand, and it's something I'm already somewhat familiar with, at least as far as the basics go.

It requires you to take on $300k in debt (on avg.) and work a ton of hours. Plus you don't even start working as a full doctor until you're almost 30. Don't be a doctor unless you actually want to be a doctor. Ask yourself, would you want to be a doctor if it only paid $60k a year? If not, then it's not for you.  Whatever you do, don't let your parents pressure you into doing something you aren't excited about. You're the one who will have to live with the consequences of your decisions. They may like being able to tell their friends that you're a doctor because, in their minds, it validates their parenting choices but, if they push you to do something that doesn't make you happy, it actually reflects failure on their part.   You're only 15, take some time to figure out what you actually want to do. It should be fairly easy to arrange to ""shadow"" a doctor at a nearby hospital for the day, giving you a view into the reality of that career. You can do something similar for the other career areas that interest you, as well."
careerguidance,3cwftr,clawedjird,1 point,Sat Jul 11 11:19:09 2015 UTC,"In that case, what are some other high-earning, stable careers? Anything relating to the fields I mentioned before?"
careerguidance,3cwftr,DrewNumberTwo,2,Sat Jul 11 12:01:49 2015 UTC,Engineering and CS can be very profitable and are in demand.
careerguidance,3cwftr,clawedjird,2,Sat Jul 11 12:29:47 2015 UTC,"Every field you mentioned has the potential to provide you with a high income. They offer varying levels of stability, however.   Law is absolutely not a stable field, with a significant minority of law grads not even working in law. Even at T14 schools, competition for law internships is extremely competitive. When you consider that getting a law degree usually requires incurring a high level of student loans, pursuing law doesn't seem like a very lucrative option.  Actuarial science is lucrative, but requires a considerable commitment to self-studying for a series of difficult exams (one of the two main tracks within the field, life and health, requires 8 total - I don't know how many the other, property and casualty, has). The exams aren't necessarily that difficult from a quantitative perspective, but require 150-350 hours of study of often tedious insurance information. Actuarial science is also becoming more and more competitive, as well. The benefit of this career is that it doesn't require you to major in anything specific. Anything relatively quantitative should suffice. As long as you pass two or three exams and get an internship, any relatively quantitative degree will suffice. My gf is an actuary and majored in finance, for example.  Computer science is possibly the most marketable degree around, right now. It's also potentially the most meritocratic of all the choices you're considering, in that your effort determines your outcome. You can graduate from a so-so state school and end up making $200,000/year at Google. Alternatively, you can go to a fancy, expensive school and graduate with no internships and a $45,000/year job if you slack off. Since computer science generally requires you to stay on top of emerging developments within the field, you shouldn't pursue it if you're only interested in it for the money.   Engineering is a vast term that encompasses a wide variety of fields. Luckily, most degrees are pretty similar for the first couple years, so you would have some time to figure out what subset interests you. Engineering is generally depicted as the stable career, but stability can vary depending on what field you choose. Salaries within engineering are more likely to stay within a consistent range than in the other careers you listed, starting off in the low-mid $50's and reaching $110's-$130's for engineering managers. Of course there are exceptions (petroleum engineering, for example), and some who study engineering also enter non-engineering fields (ex. finance). Engineering is probably the hardest degree to graduate with, of the options you listed, so it may not be worth pursuing it if you're not actually interested."

I graduated in a similar situation to you: MA in English, with most of my work experience at the university I attended.  The sad fact is that many places look at your MA and think that you're (1) overqualified and (2) prone to leave the job because--ostensibly--you'll bore of any low-level work that you get. It's not fair, but that's the attitude toward MAs right now. And it results in MA resumes with minimal work experience being trashed before they're really evaluated.  So first, I'd recommend you reconsider your position on sales. As a philosophy MA (dare I say, a philosopher?), you are a skilled communicator. You may be able to find ways to adapt your degree to sales. And a lot of large corporations will promote skilled salespeople to product management, where you will be able to direct salespeople and steer the course of marketing and sales. There's also a lot of money to be made by that career path. And it can actually be quite rewarding if you find a company that sells products that people (or businesses) want and that you believe in.  Another option--one that I disagree with but see the value of--is to leave your MA off your resume. This of course can leave gaps that you'll have to account for in the interview, but it can keep your resume from being thrown in the trash at first glance by some hiring managers.  Finally, just stick to it. It's overwhelming, and I went about six months unemployed after finishing my MA. I had little gigs here and there to help pay the bills, but it takes a toll on you being rejected or ignored for that long. And it's so disheartening being a part-time dishwasher with an MA.  I wish you all the best. Feel free to PM me; I'm happy to offer any other advice I can."

Just someone to vouch for you. For me it was a crappy $10/hr job that, over time, I leveraged into an honest-to-goodness career.  And I will second the advice on sales. Don't turn your nose up at a solid commission-based job. In my early days I was happy to work my gift of gab in service of a paycheck. To this day the single largest weekly paycheck I've ever received was from a sales gig (only once, during the Black Friday shopping madness. It was exhilaratingly lucrative). You're going to learn there's a fine line between ""lying"" and ""marketing"". It's all in how you choose to present yourself and the product. As a Philosophy major, you should be acquainted with Reality vs. Perception.   Your only real barrier to a sales gig is whether or not the business itself is reputable.

We're at a point where there are waaaaaaaaaaaay more job seekers than there are jobs. So what does a hiring manager do when they get 30k applications? They find some arbitrary and statistical way to filter the applicants down, which might actually cut out some really qualified folks. If you get past this stage, then congrats - you've made it to the interview.   However, if you want to skip all that nonsense, find someone at that company or a friend of someone at the company and get introduced. Meet them somehow someway. Go to professional meetups and offer to do things for people for free. You want to help people to the point where they want to help you back.

Now, I am willing to pretty much take any position that I can. Currently, I am trying to determine if it'd be wise to go back to school for an MBA. The music industry degree had a fair amount of law and business classes in it, so I feel it could be a natural transition to getting my MBA."

Unless you live in London, it's ridiculously hard. At the moment, I'm doing A&R work for MTA Records, unpaid, but it's something to go on the CV I suppose.

careerguidance,3crlfu,beautifulexistence,3,Fri Jul 10 05:19:42 2015 UTC,"I was a clinical psych major in undergrad.  Generally you'll hear that a psych degree is worthless unless you go for a masters or higher, and I pretty much agree with that assessment.  Particularly in a regulation-happy state like California, I wouldn't be surprised if the statutory bar for entry is pretty high to actually practice psychology.    Actually, I did a bit of research--to even be a ""psychology assistant"" requires a masters and to be a ""licensed psychologist"" (ie, anyone calling the shots) requires a doctorate.    If grad school is already in the cards, a psych major is definitely the more practical of the two degrees.  The thing about creative writing is that it can be learned, honed, and perfected completely devoid of formal education.  I'm not saying the degree won't make you a better writer, but I am saying that it's entirely possible to be a writer without a degree, which is not true for psychology."
careerguidance,3crlfu,chorjin,1 point,Fri Jul 10 14:40:44 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your reply. I hadn't really planned on grad school (though I see it as something I MIGHT do) and definitely don't really want to get a PhD or anything. I had considered being an organizational psychologist (that sort of aligns itself with my interest in the field), but it seems like a PhD is strongly recommended if not required to do that kind of work. Grants are going to cover my entire BA, and many people have told me that unless I specialize, simply HAVING a degree can be more relevant to getting a job than what the degree is in. I'm not a science/math person at all, so I'm not considering STEM whatsoever. Majoring in Creative Writing is my dream and the grants I'm eligible for will cover my entire BA, so I'd really like this to be it. Though I do believe I have a talent for it, the formal training definitely helps. Is it possible to do Psychology post-grad without pursuing it for undergrad? A friend of mine got her BA in literature, her MA in linguistics and wants to do a PhD in psychology, so that made me wonder. Sorry if I'm rambling!"
careerguidance,3crlfu,chorjin,2,Fri Jul 10 19:07:57 2015 UTC,"It certainly is possible to do a psych grad degree without much psych background, but it's certainly harder and it will limit your options a bit.  A lot of graduate programs will ask that you take the GRE with the psychology Subject Test add-on, and if you knock it out of the park, some of them will be happy to take you regardless of your undergrad background.  The test is pretty extensive in terms of foundational knowledge, so a high score is usually representative of someone who at least knows the basics of the field.    That being said, many grad programs require some proportion of research, lab work, clinical internship, etc, which you obviously won't have without being in the major.  Many of the most competitive/prestigious programs will massively favor a candidate with this experience, so even those programs that don't require it, you might find yourself out-competed by other applicants.  This site should give you a bit more of a framework around the field in general."

careerguidance,3ck7of,robuneh,3,Wed Jul 8 15:38:38 2015 UTC,"Keeping in mind that my advice is free and that's an appropriate price, I'll throw a few ideas out there:   Learn a trade, then go travel and explore it in another country. For example, I took glass blowing classes and then went to Italy and did glass blowing in Murano, Italy. If you like woodworking, try to get a job in a woodworking shop and then go to scandinavia. Or whatever. Be creative -- but learn an actual trade where you can build things yourself. you might search the web for trade schools that are somewhere abroad or you might email asking about apprenticeships. I wouldn't just ""go work for a company that sells home stuff"" unless it was very small business. Working for a place like World Market isn't going to get you into product design (which, usually, in order to design things you have to know some engineering, plus have art skills) You can easily open an etsy shop to sell little items you've collected in your travels. You could also try to find a shop like that and work there while you figure out what other kind of skills you can build/work on those.   Ultimately, you have to leave fear behind and just go with what you love. A friend of mine was obsessed with art (specifically, antique porcelain figurines) and knew French. She just thought handpainted small things were so wonderful and detailed, yada.... everyone told her she was crazy and that she'd never make any money. Now she works at one of the most elite Art Insurance companies in the world, and is an expert on pricing French porcelain. Another friend of mine makes surf boards and sells them. He's poor as hell, but he lives in the Caribbean several months of the year, California other months of the year, and he's thrilled with his life. He's not rich but he's not starving and homeless - being ""not wealthy"" doesn't mean you can't have an incredible house on the beach. So.... if you find something you have a profound passion for, and devote yourself to that, being an expert usually pays off. Definitely in terms of your personal happiness, but sometimes also financially as well. let go of the fear of being poor and throw yourself into doing what you love."

That sounds like an incredible experience - where did you take the classes? Did you need specific training or more like basic knowledge to do that job? How did you find the opportunity to go abroad? Did you work for a shop, or like a small company that did the glass blowing? How long did you live in Italy when you did that? Tell me everything!  How about starting a small business for housewares or custom made furniture? For example, I've checked out some ceramicists who make their own lines of custom made cheese boards and tableware. Obviously these come at designer prices but they are gorgeous items. Would there be any money in something like that? (For example, Elephant Ceramics)?  Thanks for the reassurance on the fear thing. I always think, worst-case scenario I'll take all my savings and go live in Thailand or something, but in reality I'm afraid of having to choose between having my dream job and having a kid, or something. I have met people who are in the arts sector and love it, though, and I'd love to be able to be like that.  Thanks again for the advice. It's definitely helpful and appreciated!"
careerguidance,3ck7of,techbelle,2,Sun Jul 12 04:41:31 2015 UTC,"I took the class here - http://www.abatezanetti.it/en/the-school-of-glass  While you don't need any training before hand, I had taken several glass blowing classes previously. You can usually find classes like these at your local community college or arts center. I think it's important to dabble, see if there's something that interests you, try it out. I'e always thought it would be neat to do woodworking or metal works, but haven't had time/put forth the effort.   I always wanted to go abroad and have lived several places abroad. I think it's way more impactful to go there and learn something rather than going to be a tourist. If you're smart about it, you can go and rent a small apartment for a month, take classes, and still end up spending less than 2k.  So its something you have to save up for, but not impossible.   Small goods are definitely easier than custom furniture. I think custom furniture is gorgeous and beautiful and worth the high costs - but it's usually weeks of work for one piece and the cost of quality wood + space + tools means it's not a 'cheap hobby' to get into.  About your fear.... I don't know... dreams and desires change over time.

careerguidance,3chnz9,highperdrive,1 point,Wed Jul 8 01:00:06 2015 UTC,"yeah... college advisor at a for-profit school is a sales job that will take anyone, but at a non-profit school, there is a ton of competition since anyone with a liberal arts or humanities degree who is good with people is qualified.  If that's what you really want, you need ""higher education"" experience. So you'd be a good position even if you got another clerical position, but at an actual university. Then you would be more qualified for the kind of stuff a college advisor would do."

I hold a Bachelor of Business Administration in Marketing and a Master of Business Administration, yet I'm having trouble finding a job due to a lack of experience. The best advice is continue as an Admin Assistant but to keep trying and applying. If you got two rounds in, obviously you did something right. I can't tell you how many jobs I've applied to and have either received 0 calls or they are looking for someone ASAP which I cannot commit to until August.  My Resume is in excellent shape and have had many compliments on the descriptions, organization, and key words that are used. I've also had several hiring managers and professionals look over my resume and have had little problems or mistakes that needed to be fixed.

EAs are very specialized to the executives they support, and it has to be a personality match as much as a fit for the job. Also, the executives themselves may have particular desires for their assistants -- they want one that only assists them with time and information management, or they want assistants who will take on additional responsibilities for their group doing more department specific tasks (more like an admin).  I know in my company, they tend to hire older EAs, but I think in the Bay Area, that's not the case.

With most research, you'd have to know a fair amount of statistics. Would it be possible to either double major, or to take a bunch of stats courses as electives to help set you up for grad school?  Also, speaking as someone who majored in pure math (as opposed to applied), I found that my skills weren't super marketable after college. Schools say that ""employers value applicants who know how to think in logical ways and solve challenging problems"" or whatever, but in this job economy, it's probably safest to have some sort of focus to your degree. My classmates who graduated with an applied math degree (like biostats, actuarial mathematics, etc) had a more direct college to career pipeline. So I guess what I'm saying is if you do decide to go with math, get in touch with your college's career services early and be intentional about what courses you take, internships you do, etc.  Anyway, best of luck with whatever you go with! :) Feel free to message me if you have any other questions, I'd be happy to talk more about it (plus I just woke up from a crazy nap and am still half asleep, so if any of this doesn't make sense let me know haha)"

UBC is a good enough school that you'll be surrounded by world class researchers and you can volunteer at their labs. You're better off going to a fancy school for post-grad. Unless you're European, Oxbridge undergrad is crazy expensive compared to UBC.  One thing Oxbridge does do better than a big school like UBC is the tutor system, where you have an academic assigned to you as a mentor. That's quite useful for career advice and recommendation letters. At UBC, you can probably find an academic whose willing to fulfil that role, but you'll have to take on the initiative to either be the type of person who comes to office hours or volunteer/work at a lab so the get to know you."

careerguidance,3ceq6i,Ben_Nevis,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:31:14 2015 UTC,"I went to a ""public Ivy"" and graduated Phi Beta Kappa. My boss went to a small regional state school I'd never heard of. My other boss went to a small regional state school I had heard of, but which I'd been raised to look down on, as it was notorious for being a party school. I was on a hiring committee recently and the candidate we liked best went to the same notorious state school. My coworker with the same rank as me also went to a ""lower-tier"" state school.   In my experience, academic pedigree matters far less for most jobs than everyone told me it would when I was trying to decide where to go to college. I do grant that I have been afforded opportunities I would not have had with a less prestigious degree, but so far nothing, like, life-changing. It also depends on what kind of job you'll be aiming for after graduation. If you're set on working on Wall Street and becoming a billionaire, then yeah, shoot for Ivy-tier schools. If you want to run for Congress someday, ditto. Most jobs, though, it's not nearly as significant.   If you're hoping for an academic job, it will absolutely matter where you get your PhD (though who your advisor is will matter as much or more). In top PhD programs, it's also true that the students disproportionately come from prestigious undergrad schools, though that generally has more to do with other factors that correlate with prestigious schools than with the mere fact of the school's name."
