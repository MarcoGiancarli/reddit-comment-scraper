ourleague,3dquvh,ReneOv,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:00:38 2015 UTC,"I would love to join but I haven't finished my placements this season. I don't play ranked, and not nearly as many normals as arams, but this would be cool.   Is the reason you don't allow unranked people to sign up is so you know where to gauge them to create balanced teams??"
ourleague,3dquvh,Ravara,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:49:07 2015 UTC,Yes this is why.
ourleague,3d5jvj,OurLeague,6,Mon Jul 13 18:18:09 2015 UTC,"That's fine,  but make a rule automatically disqualifying any player who dodges to keep things fair."
ourleague,3d5jvj,NeverEndingHope,1 point,Tue Jul 14 08:19:15 2015 UTC,100% agree. Dodging would have to disqualify you from future ARAM events.
ourleague,3d5jvj,Tover787,1 point,Tue Jul 14 12:06:59 2015 UTC,Of course!
ourleague,3d5jvj,frozen-creek,3,Tue Jul 14 13:34:43 2015 UTC,Definitely would! Sounds like a lot of fun.
ourleague,3d5jvj,mildlyabsurd,2,Mon Jul 13 19:51:49 2015 UTC,would def play
ourleague,3d5jvj,Ravara,2,Mon Jul 13 20:35:03 2015 UTC,I definitely would. 99% of my games are ARAMs lol
ourleague,3d5jvj,Lamnidae,3,Mon Jul 13 21:02:01 2015 UTC,Same here.  The player attitudes in ARAM are way more my style.  I couldn't take the personalities in normals.
ourleague,3d5jvj,Ravara,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:37:38 2015 UTC,"Same. 103 SR wins vs my 751 ARAM wins. Been playing ARAM since before it was a queue, I was so happy when they added that..."

ourleague,3d5jvj,AntHill12790,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:54:39 2015 UTC,I am in. I pride myself in my +30 win rate in aram. On multiple accounts.
ourleague,3d5jvj,FourO40,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:09:03 2015 UTC,+20 here. ARAM is just so easy if you get the right champions and if you can play them.
ourleague,3d5jvj,AntHill12790,3,Mon Jul 13 22:18:28 2015 UTC,not even that. I own all the champs and hardly reroll. its just too fun to lose at.

ourleague,3d5jvj,TacticalOyster,1 point,Tue Jul 14 07:49:51 2015 UTC,"I might, but I think it would be nice to have a rule that players must own a certain number of champs because I have zero interest in getting shitstomped by ARAM only accounts"
ourleague,3d5jvj,zoplik90,3,Tue Jul 14 17:37:49 2015 UTC,There would be no way to enforce this :/  I do know however that you would have equal chance at getting someone on your team with an aram account as getting on one on the opposite team
ourleague,3d5jvj,Tover787,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:16:08 2015 UTC,There could be a way: either in a custom or real game the person under question shuffles through all their champions. You could set a minimum amount of champs required to play or something along those lines.
ourleague,3d5jvj,zoplik90,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:48:37 2015 UTC,"The issue with that is if we have say 8 teams of 5 people, we would have to go through 40 people showing us all of their champs. It would be a huge hassle for everyone involved.  I can understand the desire for people without aram accounts, but logistically it wouldn't make sense unless we were going 100% serious with it."

ourleague,3d5jvj,NSA_Watcher,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:21:16 2015 UTC,"Would absolutely compete if you couldn't dodge. I think there should be a separate ARAM ranked ladder. Because the champs are random, but not the outcome."

ourleague,3calp9,AntHill12790,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:29:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah but I guess that would be hard since there are so many champs, so maybe just one tournament just 1v1. Bracket sort of thing"
ourleague,3calp9,AntHill12790,2,Mon Jul 6 16:31:28 2015 UTC,I actually like the idea of having a best champ NA tournament. We will look into it next week to see what champs everyone would like.
ourleague,3calp9,Ravara,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:44:18 2015 UTC,Just a heads up. Poll ends Tuesday at 9 am EST. At that point we will begin signups which will last a little over 24 hours.
ourleague,3calp9,Cowkillah25,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:20:38 2015 UTC,will there be any standard tournaments with already created ranked teams? or is it always going to be sign up and be placed on a team? I would really enjoy having my team be able to play some sort of tournament.

ourleague,3bg2yl,waittopostagainpaul,1 point,Sun Jun 28 23:25:24 2015 UTC,I assume Teemo is banned.
ourleague,3bg2yl,HamandPotatoes,2,Mon Jun 29 00:29:08 2015 UTC,"Teemo, Evelynn, RekSai I believe are perma banned. The mods could probably set up official OL rules though."
ourleague,3bg2yl,TheSupportRengar,1 point,Mon Jun 29 00:34:04 2015 UTC,"Just so that I understand, would the seeker be on one team and the hiders be on another and is there more than 1 seeker? Also what map would you want to play on? And can the hiders move around?  I know that as mods we generally set the rules, but I was just curious as to your vision of the game."
ourleague,3bg2yl,EvilJW,2,Mon Jun 29 19:12:44 2015 UTC,"Played on Dominion. 2 or 3 seekers. The hiders can move around but they cannot back to buy.   The only thing I'm worried about is if there is a RP reward or skin or something, it will encourage Hiders to camp and not really move around the map. Making the game pretty boring. Some champions rely on items to be successful, and I get that - but if all 5 hiders are just sitting in a bush for 30 minutes - seeker's get pissed and it's a boring game."
ourleague,3bg2yl,truedino,1 point,Mon Jun 29 19:16:33 2015 UTC,I think that if we did this the reward would end up being a flair and MAYBE OL points.  I like it. Honestly forgot about the Crystal Scar as a map. lol. oops.
