The Naudet brother's video shot in the lobby clearly shows a fine white airborne silt in the air and on all flat surfaces, hardly the stuff of a kerosene fire. 10' x 10' marble panels were blown off the walls, and blast resistant glass was blown outward from the lobby, far exceeding the force that any known hydrocarbon fire has ever exerted. Next, you have the problem that the towers were actually three 33 story towers stacked atop one another, separated by sky lobbies, thus the bands seen 1/3 and 2/3 around the towers on all public photos prior to collapse. And finally, you've got the fact that the elevator shafts were protected by fire bellows, designed to prevent exactly what is purported to have happened, fire traveling the length of the entire shaft. In summary, you've got the world's most patient and powerful ball of kerosene, in that it took not one but three distinct elevator rides to the lobby before exploding with a force heretofore unrecorded in the history of aviation fuel.

911truth,3dypze,Greg_Roberts_0985,5,Tue Jul 21 06:38:10 2015 UTC,"As I see it, it is not difficult to describe where the fuel goes in the collisions, assuming the planes were kind of normal.    As the plane crash the fuel spreads from the tanks in the wings and the extra tank in the bottom of the plane. During a crash the tanks tear open and the fuel spreads. This fuel is quickly ignited due to to the crash. This causes a fireball, as you can see in common airplane crashes. In many cases it even causes some kind of fuel air explosion (right at the start of the crash).    As the fuel is burning it usually burns at all places where the plane's tanks have been opened. That means that all fuel is already burning as it gets out of the plane. And that means it does not have time to drip down into elevator shafts and such.    In the case of the twin-towers, you can see the fire burns very well in the beginning. A lot of fuel must have been lost in this first fireball. In the beginning the burning is fierce, but later it gets more relaxed. There is not much place where any remaining fuel can go to without burning anyway.    So a lift-shaft is not a very good place for fuel to burn. Fuel also needs oxygen to reach high temperatures. Any burning that would occur, would be low temperature.  So: 1) the crashed plane can not deliver a great amount of fuel. And all the fuel in the plane is not much relative to the amount of material that needs to be heated up. A plane fuel-tank is very small compared to the giant building. You would need many more planes for a structure that large. 2) The fuel can not reach high temperatures under the available circumstances. And fuel is not even capable of reaching high temperatures to damage steel in the way we can see in most pictures. For high temperatures you always need a strong oxidizer.  Now we can look at the fires and collapse again: 1) Later the smoke becomes different, and the fire starts to diminish. It is a signal that almost all fuel has been burned. Some WTC video with experienced firemen describe exactly this.    And just after that the tower is suddenly collapses. This already makes it clear that not the fuel, but something else is behind the collapse.  2) The collapse is by itself very symmetric. Which is impossible to obtain with uncontrolled demolitions. Even in controlled demolitions it is very hard to make a building fall in its own footprint. So this job has been done by very well trained professionals.    3) The collapse is also near to free-fall. That means that not the structure on the top is causing damage that cause the collapses of the underlying structures. Instead it means that the structure underneath is collapsing by itself. That can only be achieved by timed damaging of the underlying structures.     Then you may have the question: who did it? why did they do it? It does not seem to make any sense.  If you follow the trail of the huge amounts of money, you have possible suspects. Many of them are related to mafia, intelligence agencies (infiltrated by mafia), trade of weapons (the legal kind of mafia), and some are related to politics (they deny any relationship with mafia).    This documentary is interesting:  Names, Connections, & Details Exposed  And also: Following the Money Trail Deeper Down the Rabbit Hole    And that is simply it: people die, because people wanted to get money. Lots and lots of it."
911truth,3dypze,Greg_Roberts_0985,2,Mon Jul 20 18:42:21 2015 UTC,"jet fuel to fall down   1) Impossible because we see a massive fireball.  At 500~ knots, the fuel would have been vaporized if not turned to mist and any fuel would have combusted at impact.  2) Hold a lighter and spray a combustible spray in front of it, try and find unburned fuel on the floor.  If you do, it's extremely minimal.  3) Even if the point of ignition was after the plane & fuel exited the structure, the flame would have engulfed everywhere the mist travelled, including the shafts."

911truth,3dmhl3,cube_radio,3,Fri Jul 17 19:54:51 2015 UTC,"tl;dr  Running this program for A = 13 a remaining mass of 69.06 corresponds to a time to collapse of 28.97 seconds and an average size dust of 90.68 ¬πm. Corresponding to a remaining solid mass of 67.43 the time to collapse is 30.30 and the average size of the dust is 97.34. The largest dust size was 170 ¬πm: As before, it is difficult to get the total mass much less than this because of insufficient energy to crush the specified amount of concrete to the required size. The conclusion that the time to fall was longer than it should have been is not essentially different than the earlier one in which a size of dust was specified...     2.6Summary There are two observations about the collapse of WTC1 which are difficult to harmonize in the context of the official explanation. One is the time with which the collapse took place and the other is the production of large clouds of dust which are seen forming during the entire collapse in the videos of the falling building. The majority of the paper has explored this di¬±culty by totally ignoring the columns and any resistance they produced. The considerations were based on the need for energy to crush the concrete and momentum conservation. However, if one ignores energy needed to crush the concrete, a reasonable estimate using resistance of the columns also produces surprisingly long times to collapse."

The information is public; build your own, as many journals have done for themselves. It wasn't the job of the report to mention WTC7, so why would it? So what? News agencies get incorrect reports during live events all the time. BBC also found the footage; it was simply under the previous year. This one isn't even really a fat. A&E911 is a joke of an organization, led by a high school teacher who thinks cardboard boxes are analogous to a skyscraper. Last I checked, there wasn't a single PHD among them, and the majority of them aren't even in relevant fields.  As far as I know, there is virtually no evidence for molten steel, and the sources for it are dubious at best, and usually second hand. Nano thermite was not found, reactive chips were that resemble many other things. The paper was published in a bunk journal with a reputation for lying, and the samples were never allowed to be examined by anyone else. No, just loud booms, described as explosions, which is extremely common and expected in such a large event. There were no squibs down the side of the towers; that's simple rubbish. Not really much of a fact. NORAD was somewhere else, and there is no evidence that Cheney was in charge of it. Intercept times are nowhere near as fast as people like to claim. Inconvenient, but unless there was proof it was foul play, it's not really any kind of evidence for or against anything. It hardly matters when multiple recognizable pieces of debris from a 757 were located, along with a huge number of eyewitnesses.  I guess I can concede this one, but I must make a point: if these were all parts of some big government op, they would have been incredibly easy to cover up or fake.  No evidence that the Israelis had foreknowledge. The rest is, therefore, entirely irrelevant.  Here's the actual quote: ""...the Navy might face a future Pearl Harbor-..."" He's not talking about a revolutionary event, he's talking about the unpreparedness of the Navy due to inferior technology. A far cry from the truther claim.  The money was never missing. It was difficult to account for due to archaic systems. The put options were not at all unusual given the economic situation at the time.  Stratesec was not in charge of security, and left the WTCs in '98. Bush left the company in '00. There is no evidence of relation between Walker and Bush. So really there's no claim or fact here at all.  The media often makes mistakes when they get different reports. Nothing unusual at all. There are many quotes along the lines of ""there was no plane"" and people have gone on record saying it was a figure of speech to emphasize how little of the plane remained above ground. There was significant debris, which is easy to see if you merely google the crash site.  Yes, a slow moving 707. Real big difference between the two. ""Could probably withstand?""

The scientific method requires an experiment be reproducible, for that, all relevant data must be open and reviewable. You can't present a black box with a spinning wheel on the outside and declare it a perpetuum mobile and not allow other researchers to open the box and look inside and tell them to build their own black box.  Dismissal as coincidence is no debunking.  No better model has been presented by you or any other supporter of the official story to prove a tower can crush itself under its own weight totally and vertically if the top 1/4 is dropped on the lower 3/4.  FEMA presents eutectic steel. Various researchers found an abundance of tiny iron spheres in the dust. A multitude of eyewitness accounts is the opposite of ""virtually no evidence"". Those ""reactive chips"" resemble what exactly? You can get your own 100% certified dust and see if it's still sparkly, just follow the instructions: separate with magnet, heat with acetylene torch. Thanks for agreeing that explosions would be expected.  Dismissal as coincidence is no debunking.  Suddenly eyewitnesses matter. Interesting.  Okay.

Everyone would be most interested if 2.25 sec of free fall was recorded in any of these journals as well as an explanation for said free fall.    It wasn't the job of the report to mention WTC7, so why would it?      Sure it was. Leaving out B7 was not providing a complete account of the terrorist events of 9/11.      So what? News agencies get incorrect reports during live events all the time. BBC also found the footage; it was simply under the previous year.     If this happens ""all the time"" it should be easy to find a comparable ""incorrect report"".     A&E911 is a joke of an organization,     That supports a new investigation. How does offering your opinion in broad brush debunk the organization? Wouldn't you need some kind of proof for others to believe your claim?      As far as I know, there is virtually no evidence for molten steel,      Does this mean it didn't happen?     and the sources for it are dubious at best,    Dubious sources?

After all these years maybe something has been identified?     The paper was published in a bunk journal with a reputation for lying,    Source proof?     and the samples were never allowed to be examined by anyone else.     Dust at GZ was collected by many.  What's the problem?       No, just loud booms, described as explosions, which is extremely common and expected in such a large event.      What do you figure was booming?     There were no squibs down the side of the towers; that's simple rubbish.     What video shows no squibs?      ...Intercept times are nowhere near as fast as people like to claim.     Source?      It hardly matters when multiple recognizable pieces of debris from a 757 were located, along with a huge number of eyewitnesses.   Was that evidence entered into some kind of report you have access to? Seems they ""cleaned"" the ""crime scene"" the same day of the attack. Considering we cannot ascertain what plane hit the Pentagon it certainly does matter a great deal.     No evidence that the Israelis had foreknowledge. The rest is, therefore, entirely irrelevant.

Does anyone else find it strange that the eutectic steel reached the theoretical maximum temperature of an office fire? Or that the theoretical maximum temperature of an office fire refers to gas temperatures, and that solid steel beams wouldn't be expected to reach the same temperature as the gas surrounding it?"

A crashing jet doesn't punch a cartoon-like outline of itself into a reinforced concrete building, says ASCE team member Mete Sozen, a professor of structural engineering at Purdue University. In this case, one wing hit the ground; the other was sheared off by the force of the impact with the Pentagon's load-bearing columns, explains Sozen, who specializes in the behavior of concrete buildings. What was left of the plane flowed into the structure in a state closer to a liquid than a solid mass. ""If you expected the entire wing to cut into the building,"" Sozen tells PM, ""it didn't happen."" The tidy hole in Ring C was 12 ft. wide‚Äînot 16 ft. ASCE concludes it was made by the jet's landing gear, not by the fuselage"
911truth,3d0js1,dubsy54321,2,Sun Jul 12 20:20:42 2015 UTC,"I find it rather puzzling that the landing gear could have made it that far and managed to punch out that hole. A circular hole is not in any way indicative of an irregularly shaped object impacting it from the opposite side. Where is the landing gear?  It takes a incredible amount of speed and mass to go through 6 walls and all the columns, walls, etc.  But doing so would inevitably smash the landing gear in the process, thus reducing its overall mass and speed.  It is virtually (albeit not technically) impossible for any object of any decent size to have cleared the obstacle course of vertical columns, bounced off the ground and still punch a near perfect circular hole out but then just vanish.  It would have had to have been intact and solid to have punched the hole out, but it would have been EXTREMELY unlikely for it to have been intact after striking columns and bursting through walls and everything else, since the Pentagone's building performance reports shows that in fact several vertical columns had been damaged but completely severed. The quasi-liquid slurry is lame attempt at explanation to me because there is NO mechanism that would cause random objects, chaotically flying object to organize themselves together and concentrate into one particular area instead of just dispersing down the various and independent paths of least resistance. To illustrate, imagine taking a snowball and throwing through the branches of a tree.  The branches will be hit, but the snowball will be slowing down and be broken up into many pieces.  It loses mass and speed and what comes out the other side is pieces of snowball.  But now if you took a snowball frozen hard, and you threw it hard enough, it would likely have enough mass and speed to break a few branches. This same principle applies.  In fact this is part of the reason NIST had to retreat away from the ""pancake"" theory.  It takes a SOLID, intact floor to preserve the proper amount of mass to even be able to damage the next floor.  What you would have at the end is a stack of floors, not dust and rubble.  If ANYTHING would have made it that far into the building, it would have been the engines. But supposedly they just evaporated.  But yet the landing gear didn't? Furthermore, how does the plane manage to descend at and angle and get so low so as to clip light poles (metal hitting metal at over 500mph) and not shear a piece of wing off and fling it across the lawn? Once in the building how does the plane maintain a horizontal ""flight"" smashing through 6 walls and numerous vertical steel columns without digging itself into the ground? Additionally, why would the terrorist even attempt such a difficult, time consuming and risky maneuver and attempt to hit such a small target area dangerously close to the ground instead of just dive bombing it? Would they somehow know that they indeed had enough time in highly protected airspace to pull off such a move?    I would like to hear your opinion on these questions and many others."

It doesn't? Really? Then what's this?   http://i.imgur.com/zQCliJ6.jpg  Now, I get that the towers and the Pentagon weren't made of identical materials. But both had steel frames with reinforced concrete facades, and one of the chief engineers working on the design of the towers has since said he personally considered the scenario of the impact of a Boeing 707 or another jet airliner when designing the buildings. So the North Tower wasn't the Pentagon - but it wasn't exactly a shed in someone's backyard either. My point is this: When a plane hits your building, you should expect to see damage in exactly in the areas where your own video shows it should. But this damage was not present in the damage pictures. You claim that pictures that show far more damage like that shown in the computer simulation are available somewhere, but haven't yet produced them for us. They aren't in the FBI photo archive I linked to earlier either.

The fact that everyone was kind of moved to the options and stock trades in terms of a carrot makes me even more suspicious.  If I were investigating I would have started here.  Options and stock trades are too obvious and traceable, easily.  It's easy to confuse the public and makes perfect sense considering how much money floats around these markets.    The names are in the summary document.  I think an FOIA request might be the first avenue but I'm sure for national security reasons it would be rejected.  But, I would love to see their investigation.  They would have had to of started investigating just like the SEC and in an informal and formal matter with reporting, assigned people, etc.  I mean why wouldn't they?  Unless of course they knew, etc., etc., etc..."

911truth,3cw8n5,You_are_Retards,4,Sat Jul 11 11:37:48 2015 UTC,"It debunks itself.    Once the first floor started to accelerate downwards, the was nothing that could stop the floor below it from failing immediately after the dynamic load hit it. Now you've got two floors falling, then three, and so on.   That's what happens in a domino chain reaction, not when the top 1/4 of a tower falls on the lower 3/4. This ""there was nothing that could stop it"" is bullshit; there is thousands of tons of structural steel below to stop it! And although not each floor was designed to withstand all static load gone dynamic, the whole structure participates at the speed of sound in steel in keeping the tower up: the ""dynamic load"" is distributed over all the height of the tower. The phenomenon is called ""damping"" and ""debunkers"" need to look up on it, this shit is getting boring.    The impact, if you want to use the ""block"" analogy [...]  impacts on only one floor in this simple model.    This is clearly bullshit. The impact impacts on the whole structure - up the top and down the bottom.   Essentially, all these ""then the mass crushed the next floor, which added to the mass and so had enough mass to crush the next floor"" is Zeno's paradox with Achilles and the tortoise all over again. It is stupid beyond measure.   They say global/total progressive collapse is inevitable - experiment or GTFO. Let them build a tower, pick up the top 1/4, drop it on the lower 3/4. Case closed.     //edit for the other goodness:   Try this simple math - let the upper 13 floors weigh one pound each, so the weight pressing down on the ""lower block"" is 13 pounds on 9/10/2001. The detached upper block accelerates on 9/11/2991 for 12 (distance between floors) feet at 18 feet per second (Chandler's video) so the terminal velocity of the block is roughly10 feet per second. F=1/2 MV2, so the thirteen blocks exert an impact of (131010)/2=650 lbs on the top floor of the block. If this is greater than the design load of the floor - or its weakest links, then it will come apart at those points. Note the huge difference between 13 and 650 in terms of load. The next floor impact is even worse as the constant acceleration means that the velocity is greater (from Chandler) and so the force is even greate by the SQUARE of the velocity (and the mass might be up by a bit too).   More bullshit. The mass of the tower stays the same! And those 650 lbs are meaningless without the displacement, because E=Fd. The energy is the same whether you have 500 Newtons and a 1 meter displacement or 1 Newton and a 500 meter displacement. Pretending the top got heavier from impacting the base and these 650 lbs crush the whole tower is stupid because the same 650 lbs are counteracted by the structure underneath because actio=reactio and conservation of momentum and all the other shit they teach sixth-graders in physics classes."

911truth,3cw8n5,Greg_Roberts_0985,5,Sat Jul 11 12:02:57 2015 UTC,"The blueprints were actually leaked, which further proved the official reports incorrect  North Tower Blueprints   the sixteen core columns that bounded the long faces of the buildings' cores had dimensions of 54 by 22 inches. The detailed drawings show that these columns maintained these dimensions through about the 66th floor.   You can then see that they taper off, as is the case in ALL skyscrapers, this is engineering 101, core columns will ALWAYS transition to columns with smaller cross-sections beyond a certain height   The load a skyscraper experiences is largely from the force of the building material itself. In most building designs, the weight of the structure is much larger than the weight of the material that it will support beyond its own weight. In technical terms, the dead load, the load of the structure, is larger than the live load, the weight of things in the structure (people, furniture, vehicles, etc.). As such, the amount of structural material required within the lower levels of a skyscraper will be much larger than the material required within higher levels   This guy seems to be using momentum to explain away the obvious controlled demolition of three skyscrapers, but fails.  We can calculate momentum using this equation:  p = m √ó v   p is the momentum in kilograms metres per second, kg m/s m is the mass in kilograms, kg v is the velocity in m/s   So, sticking with the north tower (as we have the blueprints for this building) which Flight 11 struck the northeast perimeter wall from floors 93 through 98, out of a total of 110.  Now we know for a fact this tower starts getting lighter from the 66th floor and according to FEMA's damage estimates, the north tower impact destroyed from 31 to 36 of its perimeter columns, out of a total of 240 perimeter columns.  So how does momentum from the 5 floors that had impact damage and taking into account that there was only 12 to 17 floors above in totality from said damage and the fact that vast amounts of the structure was ejected away from the building (and so cannot be used as load factor) and the said small part of structure was MUCH lighter, had much less mass and the fact the building had a redundancy factor of at least two, floor by floor?   Answer: Controlled demolition is the only logical explanation, the official government theory is nothing more than untested, unproven and illogical science, that does not make any sense."
911truth,3cw8n5,Metacancer_Hunter,3,Sat Jul 11 12:16:09 2015 UTC,"We can calculate momentum using this equation:  p = m √ó v   Which, by itself, is not very meaningful, but we can calculate the force by looking how much momentum changes over time:   F = p / t  Because, as we all know, F = m √ó a, and acceleration is the rate of change of velocity:   a = v / t   And we can derive the energy by multiplying the force with the displacement:   E = F √ó d  or, in other words,   E = m √ó g √ó h  or   E = .5 √ó m √ó v¬≤  So to get some meaningful comparison, we can calculate the kinetic energy of the plane and arrive at ~ 2-5 GJ, depending on which velocity and mass is assumed: E_kin_plane = .5 √ó 124,000kg √ó (225 m/s)¬≤ ‚âà 3.14 GJ.  We can also calculate the kinetic energy a hypothetical ""Block A"" weighing 58000 tons would impart upon impact with the rest of the building after free-falling 3.7 meters:  v = sqrt(2 √ó g √ó s) = sqrt(2 √ó 9,81m/s¬≤ √ó 3.7m) = 8.5202 m/s  E_kin_BlockA = .5 √ó m √ó v¬≤ = 1/2 √ó 58,000,000kg * (8.52 m/s)¬≤ ‚âà 2.1 Gigajoules.  We can compare this with the gravitational potential energy of a tower with the mass 500,000 tons, its center of mass 160 meters from the ground (to account for the ""tapering""):  E_gpot_wholeTower = m √ó g √ó h = 500,000,000 kg √ó 9.81m/s¬≤ √ó 160m = 784.8 GJ   If the tower fell with roughly .6g (a = 2 √ó h / t¬≤), 470.88 GJ of that gravitational potential energy were converted to kinetic energy, the rest into heat/friction/deformation.   Summa summarum, the official story wants us to believe that an activation energy with the order of magnitude 1-5 GJ sufficed to convert potential energy in the order of magnitude of 500-800 GJ in an extremely powerful reaction (P = E / t) - which makes it an extremely unstable contraption bearing more semblance with nitroglycerine than with anything meant to be a somewhat stable tower.   (If you are a debunker and have any issues with this approach: potential energy according to debunkers; the 2.1 GJ figure comes from Bazant/Zhou/Verdure and the 3.14GJ number for the plane impact was from a debunker somewhere as well)  And that is exactly why in ""Mechanics of Progressive Collapse"" (2007), Equation 6 says that W[g] > W[p]: because the gravitational potential energy of the tower (E_gpot_wholeTower or W[g]) does not stay up for free, but needs a form of ""containing"" energy - the internal (tensile) potential energy of the structure itself (W[p] = energy required to crush all floors). This energy is doing ""virtual work"" (yes, that is what it is called) and must be much smaller than the gravitational potential energy if a global progressive collapse is to ensue - but, paradoxically, much larger if the tower is supposed to stay up. This ""staying up"" means for an architectural engineer designing a tower: it must be able to withstand lateral loads (wind, most of all, in the case of the Twins) so it does not topple (because that is what weak towers do: they fall over, in a distinct sideways motion). By doing that, the potential energy doing the virtual work for the upwards vector automatically becomes much greater than the gravitational potential energy resulting from the weight and height of the tower. You would have to build an extremely well-balanced domino setup if you wanted a tower that is strong against lateral loads and hardly budges when hit by a 767-200 at Vmax (W[lateralstrength] > W[planeimpact]), but vertically falls to dust when its own top falls on it (W[gravitationalpotential] > W[potentialvirtualwork]).   tldr: 124 tons @ 225m/s > 58000 tons @ 8.52 m/s in terms of energy. The former causes a small hole, a little sway, and lots of smoke. The latter causes the whole thing to turn to dust. Error. Does not compute."

Welten 80C steel has a melting point of 1450-1510 celsius. A36 steel has a melting point of 1370-1400 celsius. '30% of their melting point' would be 453 celsius and 420 celcius, respectively.

911truth,3cbslx,WTCMolybdenum4753,-1,Thu Jul 9 10:12:35 2015 UTC,Fair point.  It is indeed not important compared to the body of other evidence.  Ive been thinking about this more and i think this what happened:  The huge steel column matrix/structures consisted of several columns interconnected. Cutting one column would not allow it to fall as it would still be attached by the rest of the structure.    These structures may be damaged and under stress. So Once cut it would not be possible to predict if it would suddenly move in a dangerous direction and rip my arm off.  Therefore i suspect angled cuts were made so that the beams could not suddenly move against the angle of the cut. The engineer would stand behind the angle and be relatively safe there.    A horizontal cut would allow the cut beam to move in any direction affording no safe standing position. The Angled cut gives a safe standing position behind the the angle.  That must be the reason. Interesting.

With the Twins' top-crush-down , I'm not so sure it would make much sense (except if the building was ripped down by the core); but as it seems that several offices and strategic places within the building were targeted with explosives to render the infrastructure unusable (SCC for roof exit lockdown, FDNY communications down etc), these basement explosions might have had a different purpose."

The charges that cut the perimeter apart would be shielded by the columns themselves (if anyone is willing to go with the theory that they were simply placed on the bolts through the access hole at the end of each perimeter column); only the white puffs of smoke coming out between the slits betray what is going on. That leaves us with those cutting apart the core, the greater part of which would also be shielded, leaving us only with the outer columns of the core to really worry about.

Pursuant to this standard, a party may raise a Daubert motion, which is a special case of motion in limine raised before or during trial to exclude the presentation of unqualified evidence to the jury. The Daubert trilogy refers to the three United States Supreme Court cases that articulated the Daubert standard     Under Daubert and FRE 702, when carrying out evidentiary gate-keeping duties under the Federal Rules of Evidence, judges must at a minimum inquire into:   1 Whether the opinion or theory is susceptible to testing and has been subjected to such testing   NIST fail - their theory is unproven and untested, there own testing, in particular, the material and fire tests conducted by NIST, did not support its initial findings They did not look for evidence of explosives, contrary to NFPA guidelines.  More importantly, any actual relevant sections of the official report are classified for public safety, they will not even release them to a licensed NYC architect in regards a FOIA request   2 Whether the opinion/theory has been subjected to peer-review and publication   The NIST report is not peer reviewed, it was and still is, self published and thus has zero credibility. In academia, peer review is used to determine an academic paper's suitability for publication.   3 Whether there is a known or potential rate of error associated with the methodology used and whether there are standards controlling the techniques‚Äô operation   The rate of error is 100%. That is, the previous rate of success in collapsing two 110-story steel skyscrapers such as WTC 1 and 2, by a fire ignited by jet fuel (even taking into account aircraft impact damage) and one 47 story steel skyscraper such as WTC 7 (which had no aircraft impact damage) is 0%. The official explanation of the destruction of these three buildings on September 11, 2001 assumes unprecedented processes and events in all three cases.   4 Whether the opinion/theory has been scrutinized and generally accepted by the scientific community.   There is no general acceptance of the United States Government conspiracy theory in the scientific community. The official theory has been rejected by many qualified experts who have reviewed and scrutinized the NIST reports and the data that NIST has made available.  *There are additional factors considered by courts, but all four main Daubert factors are applicable to all cases generally (where the Federal Rules of Evidence apply or where the state courts have adopted the Daubert or similar test)    NIST's specific objectives were:   Determine why and how WTC 1 and WTC 2 collapsed following the initial impacts of the aircraft and why and how WTC 7 collapsed; Determine why the injuries and fatalities were so high or low depending on location, including all technical aspects of fire protection, occupant behavior, evacuation, and emergency response; Determine what procedures and practices were used in the design, construction,  Identify, as specifically as possible, areas in current building and fire codes, standards, and practices that warrant revision."

The evidence of molten steel or iron cannot be called ‚Äúirrelevant,‚Äù given the fact that the building fires, as NIST pointed out, cannot explain it.    Physical Evidence     Early in 2002, Barnett and two WPI colleagues published an analysis of a section of steel from one of the Twin Towers, along with sections from WTC 7, as an appendix to FEMA‚Äôs 2002 World Trade Center Building Performance Study Their discoveries were also reported in a WPI article entitled ‚ÄúThe ‚ÄòDeep Mystery‚Äô of Melted Steel,‚Äù which said:    Steel ‚Äì which has a melting point of 2,800 degrees Fahrenheit ‚Äì may weaken and bend, but does not melt during an ordinary office fire. Yet metallurgical studies on WTC steel brought back to WPI reveal that a novel phenomenon ‚Äì called a eutectic reaction ‚Äì occurred at the surface, causing intergranular melting capable of turning a solid steel girder into Swiss cheese.    Stating that the New York Times called these findings ‚Äúperhaps the deepest mystery uncovered in the investigation,‚Äù the article added:    A one-inch column has been reduced to half-inch thickness. Its edges ‚Äì which are curled like a paper scroll ‚Äì have been thinned to almost razor sharpness. Gaping holes ‚Äì some larger than a silver dollar ‚Äì let light shine through a formerly solid steel flange. This Swiss cheese appearance shocked all of the fire-wise professors, who expected to see distortion and bending ‚Äì but not holes.    In May 2004, the RJ Lee Group issued a report, entitled ‚ÄúWTC Dust Signature,‚Äù at the request of the Deutsche Bank, in order to prove (to its insurance company) that the building was ‚Äúpervasively contaminated with WTC Dust The report listed five elements in this signature, one of which was: ‚ÄúSpherical iron and spherical or vesicular silicate particles that result from exposure to high temperature In 2005, the United States Geological Survey (USGS) published a report entitled ‚ÄúParticle Atlas of World Trade Center Dust,‚Äù which was intended to aid the ‚Äúidentification of WTC dust components.‚Äù Among the components, it reported, were ‚Äúmetal or metal oxides‚Äù (which could not be distinguished by the USGS‚Äôs methods). ‚ÄúThe primary metal and metal-oxide phases in WTC dust,‚Äù the report said, ‚Äúare Fe-rich [iron-rich] and Zn-rich [zinc-rich] particles Extremely high temperatures during the World Trade Center destruction  Journal of the American Society of Safety Engineers   The debris pile at Ground Zero was always tremendously hot. Thermal measurements taken by helicopter each day showed underground temperatures ranging from 400¬∫F to more than 2,800¬∫F  Sources related to exceptionally high temperatures, and/or to persistent heat at Ground Zero  FEMA documents in their Appendix C of its May 2002 WTC Building Performance Assessment Team study, for sample 1, ‚Äúevidence of a severe high temperature corrosion attack on the steel, including oxidation and sulfidation with subsequent intergranular melting.‚Äù A ‚Äúsulfur-rich liquid‚Äù containing ‚Äúprimarily iron, oxygen, and sulfur‚Äù ‚Äúpenetrated‚Äù into the steel.     Testimonial Evidence    Testimony from Firefighters:   New York Fire Department Captain Philip Ruvolo said: ‚ÄúYou‚Äôd get down below and you‚Äôd see molten steel, molten steel, running down the channel rails, like you‚Äôre in a foundry, like lava. Joe O‚ÄôToole, a Bronx firefighter who worked on the rescue and cleanup efforts, reported that one beam lifted from deep below the surface months later, in February 2002, ‚Äúwas dripping from the molten steel.‚Äù New York firefighters recalled in the documentary film Collateral Damages, ‚Äúheat so intense they encountered rivers of molten steel.‚Äù     Testimony from Other Professionals:     Leslie Robertson, a member of the engineering firm that designed the World Trade Center, said 21 days after the attack: ‚ÄúWhen we were down at the B1 level, one of the firefighters said, ‚ÄòI think you‚Äôd be interested in this,‚Äô and they pulled up a big block of concrete and there was a, like a little river of steel, flowing.‚Äù Ron Burger, a public health advisor at the National Center for Environmental Health who arrived at Ground Zero September 12, 2001, said: ‚ÄúFeeling the heat, seeing the molten steel, the layers upon layers of ash, like lava, it reminded me of Mt. St. Helen‚Äôs and the thousands who fled that disaster.‚Äù In late fall 2001, Dr. Alison Geyh of the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health reported: ‚ÄúFires are still actively burning and the smoke is very intense. In some pockets now being uncovered, they are finding molten steel.‚Äù Joe Allbaugh, the Director of FEMA, said in an October 2001 interview on CBS: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just too hot for rescuers to get into [some] areas. So we do not know yet what‚Äôs in those areas, other than very hot, molten material.‚Äù Dr. Keith Eaton reported in Structural Engineer: ‚ÄúThey showed us many fascinating slides . . . ranging from molten metal which was still red hot weeks after the event, to 4-inch thick steel plates sheared and bent in the disaster.‚Äù Don Carson, a hazardous materials expert from the National Operating Engineers Union, said six weeks after 9/11: ‚ÄúThere are pieces of steel being pulled out from as far as six stories underground that are still cherry red.‚Äù OSHA respond to the underground fires and potential steam explosions    Underground fires burned at temperatures up to 2,000 degrees. As the huge cranes pulled steel beams from the pile, safety experts worried about the effects of the extreme heat on the crane rigging and the hazards of contact with the hot steel. And they were concerned that applying water to cool the steel could cause a steam explosion that would propel nearby objects with deadly force. Special expertise was needed. OSHA called in Mohammad Ayub and Scott Jin, structural engineers from its national office, to assess the situation. They recommended a special handling procedure, including the use of specialized rigging and instruments.     Testimony from Other Credible Witnesses:     Greg Fuchek, vice president of a company that supplied computer equipment used to identify human remains, reported that ‚Äúsometimes when a worker would pull a steel beam from the wreckage, the end of the beam would be dripping molten steel.‚Äù Sarah Atlas, of New Jersey‚Äôs Task Force One Urban Search and Rescue, arrived at Ground Zero on September 11 and reported that ‚Äúfires burned and molten steel flowed in the pile of ruins still settling beneath her feet.‚Äù Tom Arterburn, writing in Waste Age, reported that the New York Department of Sanitation removed ‚Äúeverything from molten steel beams to human remains     Videos    WTC2 South Tower, Molten Metal pouring out the North-East Corner   Pouring molten aluminum into a pool  Molten aluminum into cold water   Evidence of fused molten metal and concrete of extreme heat.  Thermite cutting steel - Validated experimentally    The fact that the rubble contained steel or iron that had been melted shows that the buildings were destroyed by something other than fire and airplane impact.  When all of this physical evidence is combined with the testimony about explosions from many types of professionals, the claim that the Twin Towers were brought down by nothing other than the airplane impacts and resulting fires is simply not credible"

Quite a feat, one might say, considering that Flight 77 hit the Pentagon. This obvious example of the simple errors made throughout this project is an embarrassment, without a doubt. But errors do not become grave mistakes unless they go uncorrected. In this case, however, it appears that we are witnessing gross negligence at a minimum, as later in the same paper the authors make things worse by stating that the animation actually reflects the ""impact of Flight AA71"". If the authors can't even get these basic details right, in several attempts, why should people expect that the animation produced has any relevance to reality?

Given the official story, it is remarkable how little insurance premiums, or even design parameters and building construction codes,vi have been modified (if at all) to address the possibility of catastrophic fire-induced progressive collapse.

His account places an 8 hour timeframe on the eutectic action that caused the severe steel wastage. Severe corrosion, deep mystery, novel phenomenon, very unusual event, etc.     One piece Dr. Astaneh-Asl saw was a charred horizontal I-beam from 7 World Trade Center, a 47-story skyscraper that collapsed from fire eight hours after the attacks. The beam, so named because its cross-section looks like a capital I, had clearly endured searing temperatures. Parts of the flat top of the I, once five-eighths of an inch thick, had vaporized.    Less clear was whether the beam had been charred after the collapse, as it lay in the pile of burning rubble, or whether it had been engulfed in the fire that led to the building's collapse, which would provide a more telling clue.    The answer lay in the beam's twisted shape. As weight pushed down, the center portion had buckled outward.    ''This tells me it buckled while it was attached to the column,'' not as it fell, Dr. Astaneh-Asl said, adding, ''It had burned first, then buckled.''

The 6,000-gallon tank was positioned about 15 feet above the ground floor and near several lobby elevators and was meant to fuel generators that would supply electricity to the 23rd-floor bunker in the event of a power failure. Although the city made some design changes to address the concerns - moving a fuel pipe that would have run from the tank up an elevator shaft, for example - it left the tank in place. But the Fire Department repeatedly warned that a tank in that position could spread fumes throughout the building if it leaked, or, if it caught fire, could produce what one Fire Department memorandum called ""disaster.""   And Yet,   ""A cleanup is underway to remove tens of thousands of gallons of oil that spilled from 7 World Trade Center when the 47-story office tower collapsed on Sept. 11, according to a published report.

Additional oil leaked from two 6,000-gallon storage tanks owned by Salomon Smith Barney, and conduits beneath the building may have contained asbestos and feeder lines wrapped in a material containing toxins, the report said.  Two 11,690-gallon diesel fuel tanks operated by Silverstein Properties were also inside the building, but were removed in March and April and showed no evidence of spillage, Newsday said.

We're trying to spread the information so that more people are at least doubtful of the major narratives the government pushes out. Maybe if there's another such major false flag event in the future, people will be more skeptical of what we're being sold. Now, I don't think we're there yet; I think we're losing pretty badly, actually. But you have to try, cause it's the right thing to do, and maybe we will make a difference. And 9/11 is one thing that will never go away; it's etched in the national consciousness (and to some degree global) like the JFK assassination."

911truth,3b26ct,NAM007,3,Thu Jun 25 13:55:07 2015 UTC,What is 9/11 truth?
911truth,3b26ct,TheOilofPersia,5,Thu Jun 25 12:57:20 2015 UTC,"That the official story is a blatant lie on all fronts, and therefore cannot sustain it's power to mold and shape policy.   9/11 truth is a thorn in the side of the ""establishment"" and ""relevant political ruling class"".   It reveals the beast, and the extent of the level of corruption of the ""system"" wherein the evil lies.  Edit to add: 9/11 truth is not unlike getting the last laugh at the devil's expense, both as the little man and in kinship with the victims as the little man discarded, thrown away; sacrificed on the alter of what amounts in hindsight only to a power-grab for the sake of nothing but more power over the little man, which is the very business OF the devil who wishes to rule from the top down, when all good things and even life as we know it, is a democratic, bottom up, non-localized, holographic phenomenon where it could be said that because it's non-localized, local matters. And to top it all off it is based and founded on nothing more or less than the truth and the reality as it is - which i suppose is what makes it so funny on the one hand, even if it's to the groans and tears and ""weeping and wailing and gnashing of teeth"" of Princes and Presidents and Prime Misters, maybe even the Queen of England herself; brought to their knees in a heap of repentance, or rendered stoic amid the complete loss of their own sense of humor, forever. It's both very funny and very sad, and then very funny again.   I know this is a strange way to describe a horrific mass slaughter of innocents, unnecessarily, but relative to what ""they"" the so-called relevant political ruling class (who've all but completely lost all relevance) have doled out to us over the years, i don't think there's any other way to describe it but as both the height of absurdity and hypocrisy, amid the movement of the keystone and the fulcrum of history, in favor of the little man and out of the hands of the the self-proclaimed ""keepers of the flame"".   So it is funny and ironic, in the final analysis, and who cares if the devil within and among us or above us is chained and thrown into the abyss for a 1000 years. Is that our fault?   Cheers fellow truthers, and may God Bless you in every way, for climbing up on the wall of the watchtower on behalf of us all, and refusing to climb down until the right lesson can be learned that serves the cause of what is right and true and just, and aware.   We are their terror, and i am ""the smoking gun"" (lights up a smoke)   And by that i'm not advocating violence by any means, just the courage to laugh with triumph in the face of utter barbarity cloaked in the garb of civilization. It's all a lie, it's inauthentic, highly inauthentic (secretive), untrue, irrelevant and without power - add 9/11 truth, and then there's also a very big chain (of evidence) held in the hand of the little man, and it ain't no ""theory"", just commitment and dedication to the truth nothing more (giggles and laughs while swinging the chain).  That's 9/11 truth. It's historically re-vivifying.   The only thing it constrains, is the devil within the system. That's very powerful, imho.     It was the stone that was rejected by the builders, that became the keystone. Ha HA!"

911truth,3b3dn1,sacchetta,2,Thu Jun 25 17:17:15 2015 UTC,"There's a few problems I have with this analysis.  First of all, other people have analysed the sound of the collapse and have shown distinct spikes. There are videos to support this.  Second, we have many people testifying that there were loud (and many) explosions during and right before the collapse.  Also, I don't think it's entirely fair to compare a regular controlled demolition with the WTC and conclude the latter isn't one because the most prominent feature is absent on recordings. Especially with what we know about the thermitic material that was found.   Ask yourself, if you wanted to bring a building down in the middle of a big city while all the camera's are running, and with the requirement that it has to look like a regular collapse, would not the most important point be hiding the sound of explosions?  Why do the two collapsing towers sound the way they do? Have we answered that one yet? Why is it a metallic roar? I've spent some time looking at controlled demolitions on youtube, it's not that hard to find an example that sounds very similar to the WTC towers, with only distinct booms before the collapse and a metallic roar during the collapse.  Here's a collection of them: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eem7d58gjno  I can definitely see how you could hide the louder booms with the more metallic cracks. It's also obvious that at least some of the loud explosions were set off during the fires or even when the planes impacted. One of the reasons for this could've been to hide them.  Lastly, one just has to look at the collapse to notice that material is being shot out the towers at high speeds tens of stories below the collapse zone. I'll believe my eyes before I believe an unreliable microphone on a camera and assume that those kinds of 'events' do not happen without accompanying noise. From which I then have to conclude that the recordings we have of the WTC towers collapsing are not very good indicators of what actually happened."
911truth,3b3dn1,spays_marine,1 point,Thu Jun 25 19:52:39 2015 UTC,"A 3D sound comparison of the destruction of WTC 1(September 11 2001) and a controlled demolition (Sir John Carling, Ottawa July 13 2014). Do these look like the same thing to you? The video I grabbed the WTC1 sound from was removed from Youtube (must have just happened), but there should be the video in the drive folder I provided below and the part I used starts at about 18:06. Each audio clip was reduced to 16 seconds so you can easily compare the two. Here is a drive folder with larger photos and the audio clips to go along with it. In the controlled demolition example you can clearly see the blasts. Also included is a 2D snapshot of the waveforms.  WTC 1 on top, Sir John Carling (controlled demolition) on the bottom. X=Time Y=Frequency Z=Amplitude  In the 2D waveform snapshot, note the cut off peaks on the bottom picture, that is because the blast has overloaded the microphone causing it to ""clip"".  Also I should add that the relative size doesn't matter. Mic gain can be turned up or down so the actual audio can appear to be bigger or fatter in the waveform. What you want to look at is the different between peaks within the waveform. In the case of WTC 1 it is pretty even, meaning that whatever the sound was it was constant. In a controlled demolition the sound of the blast GREATLY exceeds that of background noise or environmental noise. So just because the WTC 1 example is bigger and fatter than the controlled demolition example, doesn't mean that it was actually louder. The sensitivity on the mic on the camera at GZ was turned up to a normal setting for the range of about 3-10 feet (where they would be filming their subject). At the controlled demolition I turned my gain way down in order to compensate for the incoming blasts so that my signal would not be completely overloaded. So if you were to talk in front of the mic I had set up, it would have recorded at a very low volume. Hope this makes sense!"

911truth,3b3dn1,You_are_Retards,0,Thu Jun 25 17:34:20 2015 UTC,"To my knowledge thermite has never been used in a controlled demolition sequence (the 10-20 second part with all the booms), it is very unpractical and not very well controlled. Nanothermite seems to be more of a myth, but apparently it's super crazy and will do anything/everything to anything/everything. It doesn't look like a controlled demolition because it wasn't one, other than in the sense that the structures were demolished in a controlled manner.  All I can say is keep digging because you are getting close. Think, could thermite/controlled demolition be the destructive mechanism that was responsible for the destruction seen at the WTC complex immediately after the event? Download all the pictures you can find and start comparing them, same with videos. Really be careful of the people who have spoon-fed information to you. Wipe your 9/11 slate clean and build it from the ground up based on what you can verify for yourself with primary sources.

911truth,3awnx9,northamerimassgrave,2,Wed Jun 24 05:32:49 2015 UTC,"Have you seen the movie RED with Bruce Willies?   To sum it up, the main character, former CIA and a few other characters were given chase by the CIA on the initiative of a high ranking official within the agency.   The official did act solely in his own interest, I believe in an attempt to cover up his own past.   The agents whom executed his orders gave chase and even liquidated targets without question, accepting that they are only informed on a ""need to know"" basis and usually never about the whys, ordered to do things that would be apprehensible in the wrong context, but they believed that they ultimately served the interest of the nation they serve.   This official had everyone below him basically acting illegally and it was really easy for him because the culture within the CIA (the culture portrayed in that movie) allowed him to do so, a culture where orders are blindly executed and being kept in the dark is part of the job, with the promise that ultimately all their actions, even murder and torture, in the end serve their country and the ideals it represents.   It was similiar with 911. Not too many people needed to be ""in"" on it. If you believe bombs were involved, the people whom placed them certainly knew what the deal was.  But other than that, if the brass of the airforce was told to redeploy virtually all armed fighter aircraft away from the east coast for a large scale training exercise I am sure they did not add ""because we need a credible excuse on why no jets were scrambled for intercept for 90 minutes"".   Most people were informed on a ""need to know"" basis in order to have them execute their part in the events, through action or inaction, without filling them in that they were part in a false flag operation.  Of course not everybody played ball. John. P. O'Neal for instance, whom tragically died on his new job in the twin towers, is said to have quit the FBI after, despite having been assigned to track down Al Quaeda and Bin Laden, was told to lay off Alquaeda and the Bin Laden family and affiliates. He resisted this, caused friction because he wanted an explanation and in the end quit the agency.   http://www.rense.com/general18/neil.htm  So to answer your question, it complicated, because the people whom acted unbewnoned to themselves in executing the operation certainly did not know what they were part of. Others on the other hand could have no doubt what they were part of and even if they were not filled in, it certainly must have been very strange to them that part of restructuring WTC 7 involved wiring it up for demo."

Cremation of a body takes 2 1/2 hours at 1600-1800 degrees Fahrenheit (870-980 C), and then you still have bone fragments that require further processing.  They found the remains of firefighters on the roof of a 600-foot building, showing conclusively that the conditions inside the ten or fifteen second ""collapse"" were more intense than inside a crematorium oven.  If they'd been crushed they would have held on to most of their mass and gone down with the building.  And given that about 2000 out of 2700 were either identified by DNA alone, or more likely, never identified, this shows that such conditions were widespread during the destruction event."

Temperatures are better demonstrated with the eye witnesses of molten steel. It does not help to focus on the remains.   Lots of debris was coming off the collapses. Pulverised concrete is oftem mentioned here. Also some was so destroyed it formed a particulate dust cloud. I do not see how human remains would have evaded the same forces. Actually given how robust concrete is vs. People i think the people are even more likely to have been crushed.   Discussing the remains won't help. Its the larger debris that will make the points.

While WTC 7 appeared to be a controlled demolition the destruction of 1 and 2 wasnt even that.   The buildings were pulverized all over New York with mostly just the steel beams left scattered all over the WTC complex. Controlled demolition would have been a difficult and time consuming task, where you have to gain access to all the right beams, but if you place enough explosives on every other floor near the supporting beams with some overkill, that will do the job."

Controlled demolition uses just the right amount of explosives to sewer columns, strapped to the columns. That would have caused problems in the aftermath, for left over equipment charges could have been found.  Instead large explosives were used that would take out any evidence, except for explosive residual of course. But that is no problem if you control the investigation.

911truth,3as2wh,dontkillgamefish,2,Wed Jun 24 17:48:46 2015 UTC,"The real problem is not that there are people who believe everything the government tells them - most people don't. The problem is, that whenever you bring up this subject, of why do you agree with the official version, even if you have plain evidence of contradiction before your very own eyes - it's that because most people immediately assume ""CONSPIRACY THEORY"" - as something very negative, crazy, impossible. From this point on, whatever you try to talk about, you are automatically dismissed as a crazy person. Even if previously they would agree with you on some issues, now you are a stupid conspiracy nut, and they will defend the official version, just to prove that you are wrong, no matter what you are talking about. And you can't get back to the previous conversation. You are now forever labeled as ""crazy"" and no one will listen to you, ever. Americans tend to have very strong, negative connotations to the words such as: racist, communism, socialism, conspiracy etc. The word itself is much stronger than the argument. For example, if I speak about how black people make up the majority of prisoners, and that whenever I'm in the black heavy community I would be inclined to be more mindful of people around me, not to stick out, not to provoke anybody by looking in theri eyes - I would be immediately labeled as RACIST and therfore, I would be shunned from other people, as someone who is to be avoided. No matter if my argument has merit. I am a racist, and keep your children away from me, unless I infect them with racism. The same goes for anyone who wants to talk about government. Everybody agrees that their government is lying to them, plainly in the open field. This is common knowledge. But try to raise an issue like this: Have you seen how Rumsfeld spoke on national TV and clearly said that he knew where the WOMD are located outside of Baghdad, etc...? It's a clip on youtube. Available for anyone to see. There is another clip on youtube, when a reporter points this out to him, what he said, and Rumsfeld immediately responds with ""I never said that"". This is a plain lie, on national TV, and we have proof, that a person in such a high office, would actually lie, instead of even admiting being wrong on this issue. He could've said, ""out inteligence reports at that time, were clear about this, but they were wrong. We were wrong"", but no. He never said that he knew were those weapons of mass destruction were located. He lied. and anybody will respond with ""sure, that mofo lied to us. He is a liar"". And now, ask, so how come, when he tells you that nobody knew about imminent attack, about any threat, despite so many proof that they knew in advance, how come you still believe him? And from this moment it's like OK, you crazy CONSPIRACY THEORIST! Sure, jet fuel can't melt steel beams. Are you stupid? Nobody could plant the bombs without people knowing. You are crazy. I don't want to talk to you. Any more arguments will result in mocking you, calling you names, telling people not to talk to you. You are done with this group of people, you have been labeled as crazy. End of story. This is the real problem, and we have propaganda to thank for it."
911truth,3as2wh,Makonar,1 point,Wed Jun 24 10:36:57 2015 UTC,"It's the farthest thing from ""self evident"", the officially sanctioned and MSM-supported narrative about ""what happened"" on September 11th, 2001, I'll tell you that much for certain. That their story is a lie and a misinterpretation of events and phenomenon is absolutely and utterly self evident however. It is obvious to any sane and rational, scientifically minded person looking back at the events in hindsight (and it's still to this day one of THE most searched subjects on Google), that what actually happened on 9/11 is not the least bit congruent with what we were led to believe.  Which makes the official ""history"" about it an absurdity, but sadly there are still many people who take is as gospel truth that the government's story is fundamentally true.   And if for some among you that gives you a sense of glee that evil escaped justice, then i'd say you might want to reevaluate your position especially if you've been a staunch adherent and supporter of the official story even to the degree of waging war on the so-called 9/11 truthers and the 9/11 truth movement, for the sake of a deception and a denial, at bottom, since no one can look at these events objectively and not conclude that it was a high precision military ""false flag"" operation, patsies included.    There are some people that knowingly, or unwittingly are led to DEFEND what amounts, by any degree of rational and scientific analysis, to a heinous and barbaric and murderous LIE on the back not only of the victims of 9/11 itself, but the deaths of a million or more people total when we factor in the 9/11 wars, and all manner of skulduggery and draconian measures including mass surveillance of the American people, suspension of habeus corpus in Guantanamo, etc. etc. as if fulfilling a script written three years in advance of the events by Philip D. Zelikow the very same man they charged with the responsibility of ""investigating"" the crime itself.   Do not be fooled by the deception and apparent ""slight of hand"". Take a look at the aeronautical data for flight 175 and then combine that with self evident proof of explosive controlled demolition of both the twin towers and building 7.  The official story is not only the height of absurdity but also the height of hypocrisy when viewed in light and under the scrutiny of the plain as day ""in plain sight"" truth at the heart of the matter, since steel buildings cannot ""collapse"" at near free fall speed without any loss of momentum, all the way to the ground, absent the use of explosives.   ""The Foot of God Hypothesis"" that's what i called the official explanation about what happened to the twin towers.  Grade 10 level physics will be the judge and jury of the truth about what really happened on September 11th, 2001.  Me i would rather be dedicated to the truth and reality than be made a fool by what amounts to the devil in action, caught even, red handed no less.  Who would be his advocate? There are some. Many are simply uninformed or could care less, even about a mass murder that happened only 14 years ago.   Surely Zelikow's public myth will not prevail.. (and maybe has already fallen, in the hearts and minds of the people), time will tell and soon, like within the next generation, at most. We're almost there... we're almost there... [""Luke - use the force!""] then at some certain threshold down it goes like a womp rat in Beggers canyon, but with much greater socio-political explosive power for historical awareness, understanding and the ensuing inevitable transformation. One generation. That's all we need, and we've pretty much already got it.   Ya done good 9/11 truth movement. We done good (pats and drinks all around), and indeed we were the little red engine that could that's what i called it back in spring summer and fall of 2002 when we were a very small voice crying out in the wilderness.

911truth,3apodr,Akareyon,2,Mon Jun 22 14:17:31 2015 UTC,"Notably absent from the list of scientific papers supportive of the official conspiracy theory currently in circulation on reddit is this wonderful paper by Zhou and Yu:   By introducing a design parameter called collapse stability index that controls design against progressive collapse, it is found that conventional design of a tall building usually leads to an inherently unstable structure in the event of a progressive collapse. In a subsequent feasibility study in this paper, a heavy-duty metal-based honeycomb energy absorbing structure is proposed. Using a finite element analysis, it is demonstrated that the structure is capable of absorbing potential energy released in a tall building collapse. The added energy absorbing devices will only occupy a small percentage of the total floor space. By properly designing and installing such devices, a progressive collapse, should it happen in a tall building, may be arrested within a few floors, and hence, the building is inherently stable to the progressive collapse.    So, how many high-rise buildings have been retrofitted with this ""honeycomb energy absorbing structure"" since 2004, when were building codes world-wide updated to standardize the installation of such devices?  //edit: forgot a word"

911truth,3amwhz,You_are_Retards,2,Mon Jun 22 14:33:26 2015 UTC,"Think of it like this, you have fire fighters inside the building, surrounded by floors and columns. They are essentially contained inside a box. When the floors collapsed, the things inside of those floors would have been trapped between them.  Bodies are covered in skin, which is covered in clothing. Fire fighters would be wearing thick protective clothing aswell. How likely is it that the body could be pulverised and then ejected from the clothing, out of the floor and then across the street onto a building?  A person is tiny in relation to even a single column, let alone an entire floor. There would have to be some kind of force which is simultaneously shattering and then firing the bones outwards. I doubt this was due to crushing. When buildings collapse people tend to get caught between the floors, not ejected across the street in thousands of pieces."
911truth,3amwhz,Lookingfortruths,1 point,Mon Jun 22 15:07:43 2015 UTC,"Ok thank you. that is more encouraging to get such a response.  I am afraid I am still not really completely comfortable to use the 'Bones arguments' with people because of two reasons-       much debris was ejected and pulverised and destroyed. concrete glass steel and yes people. Some of that ended up on the Deutsche roof. So there seems to be nothing specifically special about the bones of the people. Everything was subjected to a strange mechanism including them. I see no good reason to single the bones out. (and even similar no reason to single out small fragments of just the steel or just fragments of concrete It will just be making the same point that there should not be any debris on the deutsche roof).     the fact people are small, relatively, does not seem helpful. OPs link also says ""[the bone fragments] were too small...[to have been on the Deutsche roof].""  But main thought when reading this is 'smaller fragments will of course go further than larger fragments'. So, this point is not useful to me, and I fear would be a hook for faithers to pick up on (and then likely they would just stop listening).     So I think that for me it is better that I stick to the strangeness of the collapse itself, and the irrefutable fact the everything was pulverized and somehow ejected quite some distance from the tower.  This will be more likely to catch ears, so to speak.  I will leave the bones argument for those who feel it helps somehow.  Edit. Downvoted for this? Hmmm."

A more detailed analysis of the descent of the north face found three stages: (1) a slow descent with acceleration less than that of gravity that corresponded to the buckling of the exterior columns at the lower floors, (2) a freefall descent over approximately eight stories at gravitational acceleration for approximately 2.25 s, and (3) a decreasing acceleration as the north face encountered resistance from the structure below."
911truth,3agnif,PhrygianMode,3,Sat Jun 20 17:37:08 2015 UTC,"NIST originally said FFA wouldn't be possible. That is, until they were shown by a high school teacher that it did actually take place. Only then did they admit to it.   ‚Äú[A] free fall time would be [the fall time of] an object that has no structural components below it. . . . [T]he . . . time that it took . . . for those 17 floors to disappear [was roughly 40 percent longer than free fall]. And that is not at all unusual, because there was structural resistance that was provided in this particular case. And you had a sequence of structural failures that had to take place. Everything was not instantaneous.‚Äù53  In saying this, Sunder was presupposing NIST‚Äôs theory that the building was brought down by fire, which, if it could have produced a collapse of any type, could have produced only a progressive collapse.  In response, high-school physics teacher David Chandler, who was allowed to submit a question at this briefing, challenged Sunder‚Äôs denial of free fall, stating that Sunder‚Äôs ‚Äú40 percent longer‚Äù claim contradicted ‚Äúa publicly visible, easily measurable quantity.‚Äù54 Chandler then placed a video on the Internet showing that, by measuring this publicly visible quantity, anyone understanding elementary physics could see that ‚Äúfor about two and a half seconds. . . , the acceleration of the building is indistinguishable from freefall.‚Äù55 (This is, of course, free fall through the air, not through a vacuum.)  In its final report on WTC 7, which came out in November 2008, NIST ‚Äì rather amazingly ‚Äì admitted free fall. Dividing the building‚Äôs descent into three stages, NIST described the second phase as ‚Äúa freefall descent over approximately eight stories at gravitational acceleration for approximately 2.25 s[econds].‚Äù56 NIST thereby accepted Chandler‚Äôs case ‚Äì except for maintaining that the building was in absolute free fall for only 2.25, not 2.5, seconds (a trivial difference). NIST thereby affirmed a miracle, meaning a violation of one or more laws of physics."

Concrete strain limits of 0.15% in tension or 0.4% in compression are applied at the slab mid-depth, after which the slab element is completely removed from the grid (p.487). For slab elements near beams, this removes the lateral support to the beam. When the beam subsequently buckles, it is also removed from the analysis. Failure then progresses. This is quite unrealistic."""

In May 2004, the RJ Lee Group issued a report, entitled ‚ÄúWTC Dust Signature,‚Äù at the request of the Deutsche Bank, in order to prove (to its insurance company) that the building was ‚Äúpervasively contaminated with WTC Dust The report listed five elements in this signature, one of which was: ‚ÄúSpherical iron and spherical or vesicular silicate particles that result from exposure to high temperature In 2005, the United States Geological Survey (USGS) published a report entitled ‚ÄúParticle Atlas of World Trade Center Dust,‚Äù which was intended to aid the ‚Äúidentification of WTC dust components.‚Äù Among the components, it reported, were ‚Äúmetal or metal oxides‚Äù (which could not be distinguished by the USGS‚Äôs methods). ‚ÄúThe primary metal and metal-oxide phases in WTC dust,‚Äù the report said, ‚Äúare Fe-rich [iron-rich] and Zn-rich [zinc-rich] particles Extremely high temperatures during the World Trade Center destruction  Journal of the American Society of Safety Engineers   The debris pile at Ground Zero was always tremendously hot. Thermal measurements taken by helicopter each day showed underground temperatures ranging from 400¬∫F to more than 2,800¬∫F  Sources related to exceptionally high temperatures, and/or to persistent heat at Ground Zero  FEMA documents in their Appendix C of its May 2002 WTC Building Performance Assessment Team study, for sample 1, ‚Äúevidence of a severe high temperature corrosion attack on the steel, including oxidation and sulfidation with subsequent intergranular melting.‚Äù A ‚Äúsulfur-rich liquid‚Äù containing ‚Äúprimarily iron, oxygen, and sulfur‚Äù ‚Äúpenetrated‚Äù into the steel.     Testimonial Evidence    Testimony from Firefighters:   New York Fire Department Captain Philip Ruvolo said: ‚ÄúYou‚Äôd get down below and you‚Äôd see molten steel, molten steel, running down the channel rails, like you‚Äôre in a foundry, like lava. Joe O‚ÄôToole, a Bronx firefighter who worked on the rescue and cleanup efforts, reported that one beam lifted from deep below the surface months later, in February 2002, ‚Äúwas dripping from the molten steel.‚Äù New York firefighters recalled in the documentary film Collateral Damages, ‚Äúheat so intense they encountered rivers of molten steel.‚Äù     Testimony from Other Professionals:     Leslie Robertson, a member of the engineering firm that designed the World Trade Center, said 21 days after the attack: ‚ÄúWhen we were down at the B1 level, one of the firefighters said, ‚ÄòI think you‚Äôd be interested in this,‚Äô and they pulled up a big block of concrete and there was a, like a little river of steel, flowing.‚Äù Ron Burger, a public health advisor at the National Center for Environmental Health who arrived at Ground Zero September 12, 2001, said: ‚ÄúFeeling the heat, seeing the molten steel, the layers upon layers of ash, like lava, it reminded me of Mt. St. Helen‚Äôs and the thousands who fled that disaster.‚Äù In late fall 2001, Dr. Alison Geyh of the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health reported: ‚ÄúFires are still actively burning and the smoke is very intense. In some pockets now being uncovered, they are finding molten steel.‚Äù Joe Allbaugh, the Director of FEMA, said in an October 2001 interview on CBS: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just too hot for rescuers to get into [some] areas. So we do not know yet what‚Äôs in those areas, other than very hot, molten material.‚Äù Dr. Keith Eaton reported in Structural Engineer: ‚ÄúThey showed us many fascinating slides . . . ranging from molten metal which was still red hot weeks after the event, to 4-inch thick steel plates sheared and bent in the disaster.‚Äù Don Carson, a hazardous materials expert from the National Operating Engineers Union, said six weeks after 9/11: ‚ÄúThere are pieces of steel being pulled out from as far as six stories underground that are still cherry red.‚Äù OSHA respond to the underground fires and potential steam explosions    Underground fires burned at temperatures up to 2,000 degrees. As the huge cranes pulled steel beams from the pile, safety experts worried about the effects of the extreme heat on the crane rigging and the hazards of contact with the hot steel. And they were concerned that applying water to cool the steel could cause a steam explosion that would propel nearby objects with deadly force. Special expertise was needed. OSHA called in Mohammad Ayub and Scott Jin, structural engineers from its national office, to assess the situation. They recommended a special handling procedure, including the use of specialized rigging and instruments.     Testimony from Other Credible Witnesses:     Greg Fuchek, vice president of a company that supplied computer equipment used to identify human remains, reported that ‚Äúsometimes when a worker would pull a steel beam from the wreckage, the end of the beam would be dripping molten steel.‚Äù Sarah Atlas, of New Jersey‚Äôs Task Force One Urban Search and Rescue, arrived at Ground Zero on September 11 and reported that ‚Äúfires burned and molten steel flowed in the pile of ruins still settling beneath her feet.‚Äù Tom Arterburn, writing in Waste Age, reported that the New York Department of Sanitation removed ‚Äúeverything from molten steel beams to human remains     Videos    WTC2 South Tower, Molten Metal pouring out the North-East Corner   Pouring molten aluminum into a pool  Molten aluminum into cold water   Evidence of fused molten metal and concrete of extreme heat.    The fact that the rubble contained steel or iron that had been melted shows that the buildings were destroyed by something other than fire and airplane impact.  When all of this physical evidence is combined with the testimony about explosions from many types of professionals, the claim that the Twin Towers were brought down by nothing other than the airplane impacts and resulting fires is simply not credible"

[T]he Navy had fighter jets that may have been able to provide air defense over New York and Washington, DC. ... [I]f the Navy was indeed capable of providing fighters to protect these cities, this gives rise to the possibility that, had it been alerted to the hijackings quickly enough, its aircraft might have stopped at least one or two of the attacks that day.   [T]he Navy had numerous assets it could use to protect the U.S. ... ""Within three hours,"" Sea Power reported, ""an undisclosed number of Aegis guided-missile cruisers and destroyers also were underway, their magazines loaded with Standard 2 surface-to-air missiles."" These warships, which were positioned off New York and Norfolk, and along the Gulf Coast, ""provided robust early-warning and air defense capabilities to help ensure against follow-on terrorist attacks.""     The accounts described in the article also indicate that the Navy could have been involved in a training exercise on 9/11, which caused confusion over among its personnel over what was real and what was simulated. This is important information, since the 9/11 training exercises may have been one of the main methods used to paralyze the military on September 11, thereby enabling the attacks to succeed."

I don't want to know your opinion on the WTC7 computer model except to ask why you present pseudoscience as credible research.   As you are surely aware the WTC7 computer model is not verifiable or reproducible because NIST has not released all of the data associated with its supposed discovery of ""a new phenomenon that can cause the collapse of buildings"".   Unfalsifiable science is pseudoscience, as any scientist who has even a passing familiarity with Popper must know -- but you accepted it uncritically and presented it as if it has been independently verified, which is not the case. But perhaps you have never heard of Karl Popper.  Secondary criticisms of the model would include the fact that it is an extremely poor representation of the event, and as such cannot be said to be an accurate ""model"" at all.   Its progression is also stopped long before it could possibly represent the period of freefall acceleration that is so critical to a genuine understanding of the event.  All this has to be placed in the context of the fact that the computer model is the sole piece of ""evidence"" NIST has to offer to justify its claim to have properly researched what happened to the building and understood it.   NIST failed to examine even a single piece of structural steel from the structure -- a forensic investigation that actually avoided locating and examining the physical evidence that was available.  It is for these reasons that I suggest you despise real science and what it can achieve: although you present yourself as a scientist, you have shown no scientific ethics here."

911truth,39r8sz,woozlew,2,Mon Jun 15 06:02:18 2015 UTC,"I'd also be interested in seeing how the collision with the outer wall would occur.   I'm not convinced there were planes at any of the crash sites.  Showing the plane do only minor damage and then fall to the ground in pieces would open a lot of eyes.  As for the collapse, I found this explanation for it  in this thread earlier today:   Because they fell ""in"".  For the twin towers, afaik, the walls of the towers were load bearing, which means they'd offer more resistance to weight crashing down from above than the floors themselves.  What happens then is that when the top portion lets go, leaning or not, it will have lateral momentum because it doesn't collapse evenly, one side always gives up first.  So now its coming down, but it wants to go a bit sideways too.  The lower portion of the tower is still quite solid and resists.  Its not that strong though and it will collapse.  As it does, the big pieces that composed the tower smash themselves smaller and smaller.  Floors break up, beams twist, walls come apart, etc.  Each of these pieces takes the path of least resistance on the way down.  Through the next floor in their way, and not through the outer skin which is stronger and resists more as a result.  As each floor resists, the lateral momentum is absorbed and reduced, and most of that by the remaining support columns and outer structure, but gravity's a bitch and continues to pull,  so within a few floors, its vertical.  For buildings that lack a loadbearing outer skin, like perhaps this one, a lopsided collapse might just stay lopsided the whole way down and make far more of a mess.   It's basically a longer version of NIST's ""global collapse ensued"" and makes about as much  sense."

I want to know what a 40000L Jet A deflagration looks like if squeezed out between the floor slabs and how much really stays in the building: 75%, 50% or 10%; and if it manages to blow out three sides of a floor although there is already a vent in the form of an impact hole.   The cost saved for elevators, plumbing, carpets, marble, HVAC etc could be invested into the remote control of the plane (and retrofit to make ~500 KCAS at ground level possible) to take Bazants proposal to heart:   It is proposed to monitor the precise time history of displacements in building demolitions [sic!] ‚Äî for example, by radio telemetry from sacrificial accelerometers, or high-speed optical camera ‚Äî and to engineer different modes of collapse [sic!] to be monitored.

Maybe finish and furnish the impact floors to simulate the ""office fires"" that weakened the structure.    Yes, at least use some gypsum wallboard to see if there are any ""eutectic reactions"" in the debris after the total progressive collapse that will absolutely inevitably occur...   In the Cardington Fire Test, they just stacked a few wooden pallets to simulate the fire load and a few bags of sand for the live load. I'd still sponsor an old computer or two, though.    I don't think there would be enough interest to fund it with pay per view but that might defray some of the costs.   Good idea! I'm too little of a capitalist to come up with such schemes. Relics could also be sold.    I doubt any corporate sponsors would touch it. That means we would need a billionaire with a $100 million or so to    invest in truth and science. And don't forget the bookies!"

Amazing he said this months before 911. I listen to him once in a while mostly because it makes me laugh a lot but also because when he's not selling his phoney products he actually gets to the heart of some deep important humanity saving ideas.

Not everything is a limited-hangout, red-herring, CIA psy-op.     And what's the worse that could happen if it is uncovered that the administration covered up Saudi involvement for all these years?
