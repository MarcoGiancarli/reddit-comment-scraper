Miata,3e3y58,SrSkippy,2,Tue Jul 21 19:55:28 2015 UTC,pre-order LE. We have a club and a sport scheduled to be at port on 7/30 but no idea when it'll be here. this car was at port on the 11th and it just got to our dealer today
Miata,3e46yj,Stcvcn,5,Tue Jul 21 20:44:23 2015 UTC,"Actually, looks pretty good for taking an F150 up the Tailpipe."
Miata,3e46yj,Rainer3012,3,Tue Jul 21 20:47:57 2015 UTC,"How would insurance with on something like that?  The car had ~1 mile on it, and will never be the same if it isn't totaled... But all le are sold, and the entire point of le is that no more will be made.  I hope Mazda makes an exception, if only to configure a regular Miata like the le for them, and gives them a nice discount for having to wait a few more months.  At least it would be good goodwill PR."
Miata,3e46yj,maximmagnum,2,Tue Jul 21 21:22:15 2015 UTC,"It depends on your insurance coverage. If you want to buy a new car and you want it replaced instead of repaired you need a policy with gap coverage, which generally costs more.   As soon as you drive a new car off the lot it is a used car and the insurance company has legal standing to prove the car is not worth what you probably owe on it, unless you put a lot down.   Shitty situation, no doubt. From what I've read there are still LE cars around though due to dealer bullshit. Hope insurance comes through for him in time to get a replacement."

Miata,3e3b0o,tylerwatt12,4,Tue Jul 21 18:41:14 2015 UTC,I DD an NB in Quebec.  I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who doesn't really enjoy driving because it's far from ideal - skids a lot even on nice Winter tyres - but I'm happy with it and it's definitely doable.  Ohio is much milder though and the ND probably has your now-commonplace electronic assists. I wouldn't hesitate for a second honestly.
Miata,3e3b0o,SDION,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:04:00 2015 UTC,People do it. Whats your climate like? Having a set of winters on steelies is a great idea if you get a lot of snow. Hit a big parking lot and intentionally lose control and regain it... Etc etc.
Miata,3e3b0o,wizang,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:47:54 2015 UTC,"Ohio, hot summers, and lots of snow in the winter., moderately hilly. Last winter it was sub zero for at least an entire week. I'm just wondering if the soft top would be a good idea, if the back window could crack and if the TC ESC are good enough for that kind of drive."
Miata,3e3b0o,tylerwatt12,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:05:31 2015 UTC,I drive my na through the winter in wv and my soft window does fine. It handles good too when you know how it handles

Sticky tires outperform any other single upgrade you can do."
Miata,3e0e8z,Tomahawk92,10,Tue Jul 21 01:46:13 2015 UTC,Discounts on NCs as the ND rolls in?
Miata,3e0e8z,Slyons89,-1,Tue Jul 21 05:04:27 2015 UTC,Yep only logical thought considering he bought the club edition NC3. Not the basic bitch model but the club edition.

Miata,3e0e8z,Slyons89,-8,Tue Jul 21 06:09:14 2015 UTC,Here's clarification for you... All models were discounted so he said fuck it and got the premium model aka the club edition rather than base model..... So since you  misunderstood me you said in a question discounts on NC's as the ND roles in. So I said only logical thought considering he bought the most expensive model not the basic bitch aka base model. The logical thought here was discounts on the NC... You misreading asswipe.

Miata,3e0e8z,HighDecepticon,4,Tue Jul 21 22:17:24 2015 UTC,Hard top for the NC is available now and the prices on the NC's should be going down pretty heavily for leftover '14 and '15s still sitting on lots.  I'm considering an NC for those two reasons.
Miata,3e0e8z,BProfessional1,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:08:52 2015 UTC,Same reason why people buy NAs or NBs... they like the styling and the price is right. The ND is ugly in my opinion.
Miata,3e0e8z,ronin84,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:13:25 2015 UTC,Because of the price drop.
Miata,3e0e8z,et1n,3,Tue Jul 21 18:31:25 2015 UTC,Are there any upgrades I should look into or anything I can do to the car to make it last longer/perform better?
Miata,3e0e8z,SrSkippy,5,Tue Jul 21 00:10:38 2015 UTC,"Suspension is usually the best place to start on the NC, but I'd leave it stock unless you're dying to do something. (and if you are, I've got some springs I never got around to putting on mine before I sold it).  Change the oil, get the occasional wash from a nice touchless wash place to clean up the underside, don't forget to wear sunscreen."
Miata,3e0e8z,Young_Maker,5,Tue Jul 21 00:57:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah, forgetting to wear sunscreen my first full day didn't end well. That's a mistake I won't repeat."

Miata,3e0e8z,dajohnnyboy,3,Tue Jul 21 14:03:51 2015 UTC,Just enjoy it! Try some Klasse All in One to keep the paint protected and shiny too.
Miata,3e0e8z,DashingSpecialAgent,2,Tue Jul 21 02:19:41 2015 UTC,"Really depends on if you like it how it is or if you want to change stuff.  Not sure about the club suspension, but the other suspensions are a bit soft. If you want less body roll, you can just replace the anti-roll bars, Goodwin Racing has a great selection. If you want to do more you can do shocks and springs or coilovers.  Another upgrade is tires then wider wheels and tires. Highly recommended summer tires for daily driving are Pilot Super Sports, Sport Comp-2s, Continential DW, S-Drives. You can also get 200 TW tires which will be very grippy but less life.  The stock exhaust is pretty quiet, and that was my first upgrade. I went with the Roadstersport II exhaust and really like it. Quiet while cruising but sounds much better when accelerating. There's quite a few options on Goodwin Racing.  Since you have the PRHT, I'd recommend getting the Smart Top. It allows you to operate the roof with a single button push of up or down and operate it at speeds of up to 35 mph.  If you don't like the red decal on the side, you can remove it with some heat and peel it off. It is just vinyl."
Miata,3e0e8z,et1n,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:41:06 2015 UTC,"Get a SmartTop module.  It seems like a lot of money for a very small amount of inconvenience but a year in it is by far the best money I've spent on the car so far.  I have mine set so I can operate the top at anything up to 25MPH, and I can put the top down just by undoing the latch.  It's wonderful."
Miata,3e0e8z,Slev23,2,Tue Jul 21 07:43:41 2015 UTC,Can confirm. Best addon.
Miata,3e0e8z,DashingSpecialAgent,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:53:11 2015 UTC,I've really been debating this.

I suggest getting some aftermarket suspension and sway bars, it really turns the car into a slot car and handles so much better than what I would describe as a soft suspension picked out by Mazda put on there from factory."
Miata,3e0e8z,arontx,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:19:07 2015 UTC,Honestly some people may not know about the ND. Hard to imagine if you're in this sub. But Mazda barely has any info on its U.S. Site.
Miata,3e0e8z,DashingSpecialAgent,-2,Tue Jul 21 12:41:10 2015 UTC,"I don't understand this... Why get an NC if the ND is about to be available?  EDIT: Thanks for the downvotes everyone, really positive community here. Sorry for trying to learn things."
Miata,3e0e8z,arontx,4,Tue Jul 21 13:08:30 2015 UTC,"Because it's still a nice car, you can get a PRHT if you want, and instead of having to wait who knows how long for companies to start releasing mods for it you have 9 years of knowledge and equipment already in existence, and the prices should be lower because the ND is about to be available and they want last years model off the lot?"
Miata,3e0e8z,DashingSpecialAgent,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:12:49 2015 UTC,"Didn't realize OP purchased a PRHT, I could definitely see that as being the reason to go with the NC. It's surely more forgiving as a DD than my cloth top is!  Are there that many people modding the NC? Seems like most posts are about NA/NB modding."
Miata,3e0e8z,ronin84,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:37:49 2015 UTC,"There's quite a bit of support.  I think it's rarer because it's cheaper to get into a NA/NB and mod and most who do are probably hitting the track, but if you want a new car and you want aftermarket support the NC is awesome.  I've only just gotten my list of what I want to do worked out and begun to start planning purchases but I'm planning to put a bit over $10K in mods into my NC.  Super charger, full exhaust, suspension, chassis stiffening, tires/wheels, brakes if I feel I need them, possibly change the final drive ratio.  I have no plans to track the car, I just want to do the work (I intend to do everything myself and with friends) and to have an insanely fun road machine.  I could have done all that with an NA/NB (and believe me I wish I had those NA headlights), but I absolutely wanted the PRHT both as a DD situation and because you can't cut a PRHT with a pocket knife.  So that meant NC was my only choice."
Miata,3e0e8z,arontx,3,Tue Jul 21 19:15:32 2015 UTC,Because it's a great car? And maybe he doesn't like the way the ND looks?

But when you see that angry look juxtaposed next to the roundness of the NA. it makes me a bit sad even Mazada went the way of generic angressive sporty car.  Im biased I think NBs are the best looking. Or at least the back end of the NB,(its not a big difference between NA and NB back end but i can tell) i like the subtle extra curves.

Miata,3dyuqg,tsuehpsyde,3,Mon Jul 20 22:45:52 2015 UTC,I personally think the ND looks great!
Miata,3dyuqg,FiddlerOnThePotato,3,Mon Jul 20 20:53:44 2015 UTC,I appreciate how similar in size the ND is to the NA. It has to pass much more strict safety regulations but only weighs 200 or so pounds moire than the NA. That's nice to see in an era of cars getting bigger and bulkier.
Miata,3dyuqg,22quack,5,Tue Jul 21 03:05:13 2015 UTC,"While the ND looks angrier, it definitely looks more like a Miata than the NC in my opinion...  Very British sportscar like."

Miata,3e2lwq,Ulys,2,Tue Jul 21 14:01:30 2015 UTC,"I don't know the European lineup/options, but the DSC was an option in the US before the law started to require it. It's possible it was an option on the 1.8L car in the EU - I don't really know.  If the ad has a photo of the appropriate part of the dash, you can see if the DSC button is there. The button is used to turn it off & put DSC into error mode. The button on the LHD cars (like both France and the US would have) is on the dash, to the left of the steering wheel, lower than you might think. It's partially visible behind the steering wheel in this photo (it's under the air vent on that left side). When the car doesn't have DSC, there will be blank panel instead of the DSC OFF button.  I don't know if the car still has ""DSC OFF"" if it's a French language car, but it should say something other otherwise be a button. Note that next to it is a panel that is not a button, but looks a lot like the button. If the car does not have DSC, it may still have two panels there, but they'll be identical and will not move. I have memories of reaching for the DSC OFF button in friends cars and touching an unmoving panel instead!"
Miata,3e2lwq,equiraptor,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:20:15 2015 UTC,"Thanks. I was looking for that button on most cars. One of the guy told me he had it, but there was no button to turn it off, that only the 2.0 could do that.  I really prefer the 2.0 engine anyway, so it may not be an issue at all after all :D"
Miata,3e2igo,Thepappas,2,Tue Jul 21 13:31:44 2015 UTC,"As a car ages, it's sensors and other parts start to deviate a little from stock calibration.  This isn't an issue normally since the ECU just adjusts to these minor variances.  However, when you disconnect the battery the ECU ""forgets"" what it's learned and has to ""relearn"" how to idle your particular engine smoothly again.  For the next few days as your car experiences new situations (idling while hot, idling while cold, idling with A/C on, etc...) your idle and initial throttle tip-in may be a little off.  Nothing to worry about unless the behavior continues."

Miata,3e2igo,Cobra289,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:23:46 2015 UTC,"Why did you disconnect the battery?

Are you sure the terminals went back on tightly and cleanly?"
Miata,3e1l2y,pseupseudio,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:40:33 2015 UTC,"The Miata is just shy of being the smallest thing on the road, so you should be good there (it's beaten by Smart Cars and not much else).   As for the reliability, they're pretty easy.  I understand the whole maintenance thing, even though a lot of people are usually like ""it's the easiest thing to work on just learn how.""  Miata's are pretty solid, so I wouldn't be too worried there.  My '00 NB had 116k or so and no real issues (one of the spark plug wires wore out, and then one little electrical module broke). My '90 NA has slight cooling issues, in that it'll be fine for everyday usage, but if I do an extended highway run it'll start to heat up. I wouldn't go much over 150k if I were you though, I'm not worried about my 170k because the smaller things that will be going wrong I'm comfortable with my ability to fix them.   Just see if you can get one with maintenance records, have it looked at by a competent mechanic, and when you get it, replace the fluids and check all the rubber.   I don't know about shopping from a dealership, I've only ever used Craigslist, which is great.  If you're not a mechanically/car inclined person, bring a mechanic friend, or just meet at a mechanic shop to have it looked over.   There's a few little issues with certain years (SNC or some such, 65mph shimmy), other's here can help you with the particulars on those, I can never remember them.   As for fitment, I'm about 230# and 5'10"" and my seat isn't all the way back in an NA, I wouldn't be too concerned about fitment.  You'll probably be a bit closer to the pedals than you're used to, steering wheel as well, but that's just kinda part of being in a Miata.  Also can help a bit with handling, as long as your thighs aren't performing as friction brakes on the steering wheel. If you still have a bit of trouble fitting, just do a Foamectomy.  Free and easy.   Good luck!"

This event I placed 5th out of 6th... All right behind the same old school guys. 1 mr2 who is 2nd place pax in an MR-S two NBs and a 1.6. I feel as if my biggest problem is reading courses and learning than quickly.. In our region we only have 6 runs that are all under a minute long. With some small advice I was able to take my time down a full second. Any advice is appreciated. Satire isn't.   Thank you!
Miata,3e10su,Cobra289,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:19:15 2015 UTC,"I can totally relate. I'm in the middle of my first season, and its such a struggle to learn the always different course with such a little amount of time to practice. Make sure you walk the course like, 27 times. I always think I've got it, and then end up being totally overwhelmed once I get out there.   I like to take my first pass as a feeler pass. Just learning the course, going fairly slowly, and then on my next one, going balls to the walls. It helped me a lot to take a slow one and then immediately go as hard as I know how, because it allowed my final laps to find a happy middle ground between slow/smooth and fast/stupid."

Miata,3dwzhp,shutterlindsey,4,Mon Jul 20 12:14:31 2015 UTC,"which IG profile? Id be interested in seeing.   I just feel so bad for the guy. You order your new car, wait however long for it to be delivered, then excitedly drive to the dealer to pick it up, then less than a mile down the road it is taken from you. Now they have to worry about so much. How insurance is going to handle it, will that driver be held responsible, etc. Not to mention if he wants another ND he will be waiting a while for it."
Miata,3dwzhp,Griffin-dork,4,Mon Jul 20 15:02:49 2015 UTC,I believe its under jamie_mx5. He posts a lot about NDs. I originally thought it was his photo but through context clues I can only assume this is what he was talking about.   I can't imagine being in their shoes.
Miata,3dwzhp,shutterlindsey,2,Mon Jul 20 15:22:39 2015 UTC,"I just looked it up. That really sucks. I cant tell whether or not its totaled. There is a lot of damage though.

Miata,3dwzhp,Griffin-dork,2,Mon Jul 20 15:37:04 2015 UTC,"Considering the size of the vehicle and the speed it was traveling at, I'd certainly hope they wouldn't let them drive it that way. What a bummer."

The only hangup is ground clearance, but that's only really an issue on side streets where plows leave those large snow banks."
Miata,3dykdi,Geteos,2,Tue Jul 21 15:54:12 2015 UTC,"I drove my stock NA miata through 2 winters in Calgary.  Was completely fine, even with chinese brand name winter tires.  First big snowfall everyone was driving 10km/h everywhere and I was completely fine doing 50-60km/h.  It's all about being aware of your surroundings and knowing your limits. EDIT: I should add.  I did most of my driving on main roads so they were plowed fairly frequently.  The only problem with the miata is you will definitely get stuck with a lot of unshoveled snow (just like any other small car).  My C63 on the other hand..that is a mess in the winter."
Miata,3dykdi,Starky_D,2,Mon Jul 20 19:12:17 2015 UTC,I personally cannot wait for winter in colorado. Gonna get some snow tires and it'll be fun until we get a bunch of snow

Miata,3dv7ue,digital0129,6,Sun Jul 19 22:11:28 2015 UTC,"I drove a 89 Miata for 25 years.  When it finally died I got in a new model.  My first thought was ""this is so much bigger.""  It felt ""bloated.""  I'm glad they have gone back to a cozier feel.  But that screen on the dash is inexcusable.

Miata,3dv7ue,SDION,2,Mon Jul 20 13:01:10 2015 UTC,I was told that they incorporated the screen due to the US law that requires all cars sold after 2015 to have back up cameras.

Ultimately you'll have to take off the soft top then have to have an upholstery shop stitch in a new replacement window. It's just easier to replace the whole top while you're at it try and get the glass window homie. Unless you want to go ghetto and rivet some clear vinyl in place of the current window at least that what I'd do until I can afford a glass window soft top.

Not the best, not by a long shot.

Miata,3dwpcu,dia1ectik,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:04:36 2015 UTC,"I've recommended this one before to the Miata crowd, but since you have a PRHT it's not quite as applicable to you. The Koonlung K1S is a great dashcam since you can hide away the recording module, so it won't be accessible to anybody breaking into your car. It's got front and rear cameras, 1080p, good FOV, and you can output what the cameras see to another monitor, so you can use it as a backup camera or such. The biggest downside is the price.  Since you won't be as concerned with somebody breaking in (kinda hard to cut through a hard top!), my other recommendation is a G1W, since it's cheap and pretty good quality. You can route the power cable around the windshield quite easily; I've done a hidden cable install on my Grand Am with the K1S, and on a VW Eos with the G1W. When I eventually get my NC Miata, I'm going to do a video install of the whole thing, but perhaps you won't want to wait that long lol.

Miata,3dvumw,LM_Graphic,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:26:30 2015 UTC,Check for codes on the diagnostic port. Did you replace the wires when you replaced plugs?
Miata,3dvumw,emptyminded42,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:43:52 2015 UTC,"I changed the wires out with a friends, but it didn't make a difference so I put mine back on.   Also It's OBD1, so advanced auto can't check the codes. Before I replaced the O2 sensor the check engine light wasn't even on so I don't even know if it would put out any codes. would it still be worth it to pay 60+ bucks for a shop to try and check for them?"
Miata,3dvumw,emptyminded42,2,Mon Jul 20 00:48:57 2015 UTC,"Hey, check out this article on how to check codes.  Sorry, was on phone earlier and didn't have miata.net handy.

Miata,3dvumw,miatainkansas,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:01:33 2015 UTC,You don't need to take it to the shop. Search on Miata.net or read your owners manual for what codes mean. You can check by jumping two sockets with a paper clip or wire.
Miata,3dvumw,Willowfiaco,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:53:08 2015 UTC,Do miatas have lockup torque converters? Sounds like it might not be unlocking. Does it die if you keep it under 30 mph or so?  Does it shift right?
Miata,3dvumw,LivingstonArt,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:46:59 2015 UTC,Its a 91 right. Look into the short nose crank. My brother had a short nose crank and it stuttered and would not go when it got bad. Look it up on miata.net there should be an easy way to tell if it in or not.
Miata,3du9q9,Gen_Jack_Ripper,7,Sun Jul 19 15:14:24 2015 UTC,Proper way to tell if you have an LSD: Pull a half-shaft and look inside for the LSD mechanism.  The Fun Way: Do a burnout and count the stripes.  :)
Miata,3du9q9,NewbieTwo,-5,Sun Jul 19 17:07:15 2015 UTC,Or just jack it up and turn one of the wheels.
Miata,3du9q9,noeatnosleep,5,Sun Jul 19 17:10:47 2015 UTC,Torsens can act like an open diff when no load is applied.  So putting it up in the air and spinning a tire is not an accurate way to tell.
Miata,3du9q9,NewbieTwo,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:29:20 2015 UTC,So do VLSD's though that isn't generally applicable to a miata.
Miata,3du9q9,Troybylt,-3,Mon Jul 20 00:29:23 2015 UTC,"It's worked for me in the past. I just did this on a 74 comet. Owner said it was LSD. Did the wheel spin check, then took it for a ride. It passed the spin test and the burnout test."
Miata,3du9q9,noeatnosleep,3,Sun Jul 19 20:32:33 2015 UTC,"Clutch LSD vs Torsen, vs VLSD everything is a little different."

Miata,3du9q9,joshuad80,2,Sun Jul 19 16:58:17 2015 UTC,There's a fun way to find out if you don't mind stressing your drive train a bit.
Miata,3du9q9,mineobile,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:26:25 2015 UTC,"I did a quick google search and came up with this.  How to tell if you have a LSD  Also saw on an autox forum that you can jack up the rear and turn one wheel, if the other spins the SAME direction then it is an LSD.  Or you can put the car in gear and if you can stop one wheel easily then it is an open diff.   Not sure how reliable or accurate this is just what I found.  Hope it helps.  ****Not liable for any injuries or damage done to vehicle."
Miata,3du9q9,22quack,4,Sun Jul 19 18:17:50 2015 UTC,I think this only applies for clutch pack LSDs. Torsens (the 1.8 LSD) behave like open diffs if at least wheel is off the ground
Miata,3du9q9,stahlgrau,2,Sun Jul 19 20:16:43 2015 UTC,Right wheel in gravel or dirt.  Left wheel on pavement.  Drop clutch.  Rubber on road = LSD.

Miata,3du9q9,GearHeadedPencil,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:50:57 2015 UTC,"Congrats! Looks super clean. If/when you have questions/problems, Google google google. A good way to get familiar is to start with fluid changes. Also buy the enthusiast's manual. Much more detailed than the Haynes. First good way to get acquainted is to get her up on stands and do an oil change, trans fluid change and diff fluid change. Use the good stuff and then don't look back. Red Line/Mobile 1 etc. It's cheap insurance and it will get you underneath the car looking around. Great that you've got a fresh motor. Might want to keep an eye on rubber parts. They don't always get replaced in a rebuild and can be a real headache, if, say, a $10 heater hose lets go on you on the highway far from civilization. Have fun!"
Miata,3du9q9,raybrant,-3,Sun Jul 19 21:33:35 2015 UTC,Just lift the rear end and spin the wheels by hand. That'll tell you if you have an LSD

Miata,3dt9m0,tmeowbs,12,Sun Jul 19 06:09:36 2015 UTC,You are suppose to not lock the doors and just let them enter and take whatever they want. This way you won't have slashed tops or broken windows. I would just patch it and replace it when you have more cash.
Miata,3dt9m0,RG400SmartTowel,5,Sun Jul 19 10:03:25 2015 UTC,"I tend to just leave the top down. There's truly nothing in there worth stealing. People give me weird looks, but once I explain it to them they get it."

Miata,3dt9m0,Somewhat_stanced620,6,Mon Jul 20 08:55:06 2015 UTC,"You know what man, it sucks but dont let it get you down. I would replace it personally, to avoid future issues. Maybe sell it extra cheap to someone whos willing to patch it?  If a new one isnt in your budget then patching it will be a temp fix.  Hope your week gets better!"
Miata,3dt9m0,FoFoJoe,7,Sun Jul 19 08:05:25 2015 UTC,"First, take a deep breath and prioritize.  First you need a top, get yourself a top off Amazon or directly from a manufacturer.  They can go for as little as $150, but I recommend getting one with glass and getting a rain rail at the same time (yours is likely cracked at it's age).  Even a novice can install a new top in a weekend, so it's not that huge a deal doing it yourself if you're mechanically inclined.  Next you'll need to keep this from happening again.  First, put a stock radio back in.  They go for as little as $50, but modded ones with an aux in jack can be had for around $100 and are worth the extra price to be able to easily use MP3 players.  Next, remove the sun visors. It just makes it so much easier to see for us tall guys.  Lastly, get in the habit of never leaving ANYTHING visible in the car.  Crackheads will slash your top for $0.35 in change in the cup holder.  No sunglasses, hats, phone chargers, nothing left out.  Put it all away before getting out.  Edit: If you do get a hard top in the future, be aware they can be sold easily for $1000 and are easy to steal, so they are very popular with thieves.  Make sure you get a good aftermarket hard top lock system if you get a hard top."
Miata,3dt9m0,NewbieTwo,4,Sun Jul 19 14:52:28 2015 UTC,"This is all very good advice, thanks.   Like everyone says, I'll replace the soft top soon. I really like the ones sold by Moss with the panoramic rear windows (anything to minimize the terrible blind spots while driving with the top up. Maybe it's my driving position for right now but it's one of my least favorite parts about the car) but honestly I should maybe just buy the cheapest one in case this happens again.  You're absolutely right about the visibility - I've already done a visor and armrest removal, and as soon as I can snag NB seats for a reasonable price I'll do a pretty aggressive foamectomy.  I don't know if I can live without iPod controls so I think what I might do is buy a stock radio and rig up a fake OEM faceplate? I'll see. There are a few parts cars in my area.  I'm gonna buy a hardtop - I think I can get one that's a little dinged up on Craigslist for about $700, and I'll get a nice locking system for it before I think about parking in New Brunswick again."
Miata,3dt9m0,NewbieTwo,2,Sun Jul 19 15:21:29 2015 UTC,"Well, the visibility with the soft tops is always crap due to the need for a small window that folds.  The visibility with the hard top is 200% better due to it's large glass window that curves around the whole back.  An easier solution if you find you can't live with the OEM head unit is to put an aftermarket head unit in the glove box.  With bluetooth connectivity and a remote, there is very little need to actually access the head unit itself anymore.  Just leave the OEM head unit in place to fool thieves."
Miata,3dt9m0,Romdog,3,Sun Jul 19 15:55:44 2015 UTC,"We've all been there. My Miata was the first car I ever bought myself too, and it got totaled two weeks after I bought it. Having to get a new soft top is really unfortunate but it's only a setback! Hope for the best for you man."

Miata,3dt9m0,flyingliz45,3,Mon Jul 20 21:11:02 2015 UTC,"That sucks.   As for next steps, I would suggest replacing the soft top and buying a hard top. There are aftermarket kits available that make it pretty damn hard to steal a hard top, and definitely go for one of those. They use different brackets to attach the top at the sides, with special bolts that are kind of like wheel lock lug nuts. A committed pro will still get your top, but it will deter 99% of the bad guys who think about it.   You can replace the soft top yourself. I replaced the top on my 95 last year, and helped a buddy replace the top on his 02 yesterday. It takes time and patience, but doesn't require any particular skill or special tools. Robbins makes high quality replacement tops for around $250. A dealer or upholstery shop will likely charge you $500+ just for the labor to install it, so there are real savings from doing it yourself.   And don't lock your doors when the hard top isn't on."
Miata,3dt9m0,chaozhammer,2,Sun Jul 19 12:34:02 2015 UTC,"You can get a soft top for as cheap as $160 (and they are decent, previous owner put one on my car). Changing it yourself is supposedly a pain, but not hard.  This is why my car is always unlocked. I would rather them snag whatever I happen to leave in there (which isn't much) than have the soft top slashed."

Miata,3dry77,MultiMegaGus,2,Sun Jul 19 02:05:42 2015 UTC,"Winged it, although I had to take the aerial off first as that's the highest point of the car!"
Miata,3dthp3,nguyenkenneth,3,Sun Jul 19 08:21:23 2015 UTC,"Improving handling is probably your best bet. Some performance summer tires should be your first buy, with some lightweight wheels. Front and rear sway bars and/or a decent set of coilovers will also help."
Miata,3dthp3,cyberrdrake,3,Sun Jul 19 09:09:41 2015 UTC,"You can't buy a car for less than $40,000 that is more fun and ""race car like"" to drive right out of the box. What makes Miatas so special is the way they handle and communicate with the driver.  While everyone who has never owned one says they need more power, that should be way down your list. Instead, start with the following:   Roll bar. They are required at every track I was been to. You need a ""real"" bar, too, not just a ""style bar."" Boss Frog and Hard Dog are the most popular. Blackbird Fabworx bars are awesome but a little more expensive. If you aren't going to do track days, you can and probably should skip the roll bar. They aren't required for autox, and a pretty good case can be made that they are more dangerous to the driver on the street.  Tires. Good tires are a must. Look at ultra high performance summer tires.  Wheels. Miatas are VERY sensitive to unsprung weight. The OEM alloys are pretty good, but if you want to upgrade stick with 15"" wheels on a NA. Do NOT put 16s or 17s on--they are too heavy and will kill the handling. And get the lightest wheels you can. 15x7 or 15x8 are the best all around wheel sizes and let you run 205/50-15 tires. There are lots of great performance tire options in that size. Good 15x7 or 15x8 wheels should weigh no more than 12-14 pounds each, and are available new for around $500-600 for a set of four. The Enkei RPF1 and 949 Racing 6UL are excellent and popular, but there are lots of other good options in that price and weight range.   Suspension. Miatas are a little undersprung from the factory. Stiffer springs with well matched shocks, stiffer roll bars and a one inch or so drop in ride height really makes them come alive on the track and autox. A good budget setup is one of the Flyin Miata kits (ranging from ""Stage 1"" to ""Stage 2.5""). You can go all the way up to $6,000 on a top quality set of coilovers, but the best bang for your buck is in the $1,000 to $1,500 range."
Miata,3dthp3,Sunburst34,1 point,Sun Jul 19 12:24:13 2015 UTC,"Forgot to mention a roll bar, and thanks for elaborating. :)"
Miata,3dthp3,cyberrdrake,2,Sun Jul 19 16:39:37 2015 UTC,"As the other people here are saying, Miata's aren't about power, they're about handling, so work to improve that.  Now, I'm still new here as well, so hopefully someone can come correct what I get wrong here, but this is what I've found out so far from this reddit and my own research.  Suspension and rubber is a good starting point, even if you don't change the wheels yet, just get the grippiest things you can stick on those 14's.  Otherwise, kick it up to 15's. 16's aren't horrible, but they're unnecessarily large and heavy, and have much worse tire options than 15's.  Someone correct me if I'm wrong, but my understanding is that 15x7's will do 195's and 205's, while 15x8's will do 205's, 215's, and 225's.  Suspension is a must, there's tons of options out there depending on how much you want to spend.  People will scream and yell and nay-say on running anything under $1,000 it seems (exception being the FM Vmaxx, and even some people get mad at the thought of those), but both the Miata's I've owned/own have had cheapo coilovers put on by the previous owner, and while I can't speak to their longevity, the Emusa coilovers on my NB dropped it low (if that's your thing) were really stiff, and handled pretty damn well, while the Racelands (ricelands) on my current NA are taller, softer, and nicer for DD usage.  Though I do plan on replacing them with FM V-Maxx's when I get the chance.   I can't speak for swaybars - I don't understand them yet.  But I hear they're good. As to front/rear and sizes....I really don't know, I'm still working on figuring that out.   One thing that I notice between my NA and the NB I used to have, is that the NA feels not as stiff. So I would definitely recommend bracing as much as possible.  A roll bar will help with this, possibly door bars or getting a 3/4th cage depending on how much you want to spend, as well as chassis bracing (look at FM for this, their butterfly brace is highly recommended everywhere I've found).  I've seen a number of people saying that having a roll bar is more dangerous than not having a roll bar, and I'd say it's kinda a toss up.  If you're never driving hard, or on twisty roads, then yeah, it probably is.  But if your short, or if you put in bucket seats and harnesses, or if you drive a lot on twisty roads, then I'd much rather chance the rear end collision than the roll over. Just remember that safety gear is a system - no bar/stock seats/airbag/3 point seatbelt all works together.  roll bar/fixed bucket seats/no airbag/5-6 point harness all works together.  Be careful if you're mixing and matching.   There is, however, one giant improvement that people always fail to mention: the driver.  You could have a full blown race car and still lose to a dude in a rusty civic. The best way to make a Miata sportier is to learn how to drive sportier (I am what you call a ""noob"" in this department).  So get in, get driving, and get practicing!   Good luck, and welcome to the family."

The 6spd even in perfect condition is not a smooth shifting transmission.  Also first year is stupid low.  3rd gear Just to break 60mph.

I can't wait to slip my 4.1 onto the 6 speed though, snappy short ratios are fun for drift cars.  The true catch is as already mentioned, the 6 speed is sloppy, and reverse is basically in the same place as 6th. I really need to think of a simple way to either block reverse off or increase the spring pressure ten fold because with my numb calloused meat paws I can't feel the difference in the 6th slot and reverse, not until it grinds at me at least. But hey! That's grams saved when I flush them pesky teeth out with the next gearbox oil change."

You're a safe driver, you left some space. But what if he instantly became stationary? Could you stop in the 30 or 40 feet separating you? No car on the road could.  I mention, not because that is feasible, but because that is what essentially happens when the car in front of you runs over something that is already stationary. It just appears in front of you, already stopped with you travelling 60-80mph towards it. In my case, it was the entire front bumper of a car, or at least the plastic outer shell of the bumper. The car in front of me runs it over and flips it up into the air like a goddamn boomerang. I slam on my brakes but only shave off 20 or 30 mph of speed before it crashes into my hood and windshield and tumbles up and over my roof. I continue on down the road and go to work.

Just bought mine so pm if you have any questions. If youre paying 5gs for a miata you better not be seeing any rust and you should plan to hold onto it for a while.

I had a good look around and the paint seems to be quite good, maybe a couple of small nicks but barely any rock chips at all. No rust just about anywhere. Only place I saw some was on the exhaust hanger near the middle of the car. There looked to be oil or at least some grime on the bottom of the oil pan, not sure if thats normal or whats up. This is in Indiana so to see one with almost nonexistent rust is quite wild. He's asking $5500. What do you guys think?  http://i.imgur.com/B1l4gUr.jpg  http://i.imgur.com/3bna1pc.jpg"
Miata,3dpznv,MooseDog00,2,Sat Jul 18 23:02:35 2015 UTC,"5.5 is too much. Yellow is rare and all, but he doesn't even seem to be aware of that.  If you give it a shot, I would definitely haggle the heck out of that. Even being yellow, a '92 w/ 95k miles should never be over 4k"
Miata,3dpznv,jimbodeeny,1 point,Sun Jul 19 06:16:07 2015 UTC,That's what I was thinking but didn't know how it would compare to the usual 2-3k NAs you see much more often. I think if I decide to buy it I'll tell him 4 or something then just let it sit till he calls back. I've looked and he doesn't seem to have put it online anywhere so he's relying just on traffic in front of his house.

The car runs strong and idles well, but there is minor corrosion all around on the surface of some parts. The only mechanical issue that there seems to be is at WOT in low gear, the turbo loses boost at 4k RPM- owner says that he thinks it is a wastegate issue. Help?

The E46 is also a nice car, but a porker by comparison, and its steering, while light years ahead of the electric shit we have today is numb by comparison.  The problem is government.  They are passing all sorts of stupid and annoying laws with respect to vehicle certification in an attempt to regulate safety and common sense.  You can't do that and expect a reasonable outcome.  First thing I'm doing as president / dictator: removing the ability of the government to regulate automobile production beyond ""require turn signals and headlights that don't blind oncoming traffic"".  If you really want to get tweaked, realize that Lotus no longer brings the Elise to the US because Lotus refused to meet all the requirements for 4000 airbags and the like.

Examine all 4 corners where the head meets the block, do you see lots of fresh oil in any corner?  I somehow blew the gasket in my car, it would only ever use coolant if I drove for a long time on the highway. It also leaked oil like a stuck pig from an oil return port, but only occasionally. My coolant temperatures were super unstable, high load would make it spike instantly but the heuristics of the stock gauge hides it entirely. If you don't see coolant dripping or steaming out somewhere, it's being burned.   A compression test would tell you a lot, mainly if the block is worth wasting time on."

Miata,3dovlk,Arkapella,2,Sat Jul 18 01:17:29 2015 UTC,"Since you haven't gotten a serious and helpful reply, I'll try to give it a shot.  I've heard about people relocation their air filters and about people removing charcoal canisters but not about people removing charcoal canisters in order to place the airfilter there. That doesn't really matter though. Under bonnet temperatures are very high throughout the whole engine room, so having an open filter under your hood gives you no or very small benefits (like the racing beat set up) and in the worst case you lose power from the heat. BUT there is a solution and it's called a randall cowl intake, dyno proven to get you 2-3hp extra across the power band.  You can fabricate a DIY version with some hose that's made out of something that's heat resistant enough. It works with your stock airbox and you'll get a sweet growl out of your engine while accelerating.  Since you have a pre-94 model, another recommendation is getting an RX7 AFM and tinkering a bit with that, since the miata AFM is one of it's main restrictions. Some guy has made tests with slightly modified and completely stock miatas and his end result was, that you can easily get 5hp power increase at the top. You can read all about it on here. Lots of tips for cheap and not so cheap power mods for your miata."
Miata,3dovlk,nignog2307,2,Sat Jul 18 13:47:07 2015 UTC,"Thanks man, I'll have to look into it, I have a pod and a cowl that connects to the space just behind the engine (it's 4 in the morning I can't be bothered thinking of the name), and a new stainless induction pipe, still have the stock afm which I'm aware is restrictive, but yeah I'll look into the rx7 one. Does it matter which model? A mate of mine is wrecking an fd."
Miata,3dovlk,nignog2307,2,Sat Jul 18 18:21:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah, only FC afms work since the later models had a mass airflow sensor similar to the one in the 1.8 models, which are not compatible.  As a note: It's probably been discussed countless times and the info is all over the net when it comes to cold air intakes, short ram or custom intake setups for the miata so I can image most posters are not really interested in discussing this again. The best advice is really to invest some time and do your own research on what you're going to do. Post results at the end."
Miata,3dovlk,miatainkansas,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:08:45 2015 UTC,"Yeah I'll have to check it all out, I'm fine with the whole intake side of things, as I said I've already got a pod, cowl and a few other things in the car, all that needs to happen now is to replace the stock afm and figure out a way to get the 'cold air' intake away from the exhaust, even a couple of degrees lower will be fine by me.

I can think of two reasons it might not be compatible.  Does your radio have an in-dash CD changer? The Mazda Modular radios could have an in-dash CD changer module installed in place of the single CD player as an accessory. Usually these aftermarket aux/USB cables emulate an external CD changer protocol and the head unit can't support two CD changers.  The other possibility is that the listing is wrong and the adapter won't work on 2001-2003. 2004 and later radios have a ""SAT"" button that attempts to communicate to a satellite radio receiver on that accessory port. This adapter may be emulating a satellite receiver instead of a CD changer."
Miata,3dn724,AKADriver,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:36:34 2015 UTC,"Yes, I think it's the same model. I don't have a cd changer installed, so it would have to be option two, right? That, or the cable is faulty but I have no way to check that. I will contact the seller and see if they can clear this up. Thanks for your input!"

Miata,3doae3,IAmInACubicle,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:10:18 2015 UTC,Replace the speedo cable. The noise and the bounce say it's time. The only thing left is waiting for it to snap.
Miata,3doae3,Sir_not_sir,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:20:58 2015 UTC,"I agree it needs replacement. The thing is, I neither need nor use my speedo, as I use my phone (quicker and more info), and I don't feel comfortable tearing into the dash with my current amount of DIY knowledge. Nor do I actually have the $80 right now to get a speedo cable.  I definitely plan on replacing it when I am able, but right now I'm not very able, and therefore am wondering if just disconnecting it will prevent damage to the gear, or if I should be worried about gear damage at all."
Miata,3doae3,DaRuski,2,Fri Jul 17 22:28:11 2015 UTC,It only takes 5 minutes and a screwdriver to disconnect the cable.  Check out the first couple of steps here:  http://revlimiter.net/mods/gauge_install.php
Miata,3doae3,Sir_not_sir,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:19:11 2015 UTC,The speedo gear is constant mesh with the output shaft anyway. Disconnecting the speedo cable won't affect it at all.

Miata,3dn45n,TheSNStang,5,Fri Jul 17 16:50:41 2015 UTC,"Hard Dog and Boss Frog both make bars that have harness attachment points and also fit under the soft top. Not all of them fit hardtops, though, so it pays to do a little research. SCCA & NASA require the diagonal cross members, and a bar that fills the SOLO 1 SCCA requirement will sit very close to your head and might actually be dangerous without a helmet on, so think this through at length.   If you want a bar that seems to do it all, the Boss Frog ""Clearview"" fits hard and soft tops and will provide ample protection if you attempt creative landscaping. I think it does require a separate harness attachment bar."

Had my heart sink when I got. it back together and it didn't work but found the problem connectors behind the glove box. Only hard part is owning an air compressor to spray it but seems like you can just paint it. I had to ad like 12 ounces of water to dilute it enough to spray.

Everything I've searched on Miata.net/clubroaster/r/miata doesn't seem to give anything for this problem, rather the more common problem of the headlights not sitting flush with the hood in the down position. In my case the entire housing doesn't come all the way up. Is there anyway/anyone can give tips on how to reset the fully up position?"
Miata,3dlrh5,SHO_SC,5,Fri Jul 17 08:21:37 2015 UTC,"Not 100% sure if it'll work or not but easy enough to try. What I'd do is put the lights in the up position, unplug the motor for that light and use the manual crank and see if that lifts it up all the way. If it does plug the motor back in and they should move all the way through the travel again."
Miata,3dlrh5,bombala,3,Fri Jul 17 08:27:40 2015 UTC,Shouldn't need to unplug the motor or mess with any electrics. Just use the red knob that sticks up behind the headlight (remove the cover) to adjust the height and get the lights lined up. Headlight motors.

Miata,3dlrh5,Ericjergs,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:57:07 2015 UTC,You have to remove the bar that connects the motor to the headlight and then reconnect it to match the correct side.
Miata,3dlrh5,iGhast,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:55:11 2015 UTC,"I have jass performance headlights and after hours of adjusting I figured out the best way to level your headlights.  First make sure your headlights are up, then disconnect the ""retractor"" fuse from your fusebox OR simple unplug the headlight motor on that side. Then pull off the black cap from your motor adjuster and twirl the little red knob until your headlight sits at the same height as the other one. (Take your time, this will be its final position) now listen closely. Unbolt the 14mm bolt that connects the headlight rod to your motor and HOLD its position. While you are holding the rod that determines the position plug the headlight motor back in. The red cap will twirl and go back to the ""up"" position. Reconnect the rod and BAM. Fixed headlight position."

Miata,3dmb5y,NewbieTwo,2,Fri Jul 17 17:11:51 2015 UTC,"First, when you turn your car on, but don't start the engine, does the check engine light illuminate?  It's odd for an engine to stumble that bad and not trip a CEL.  If it doesn't turn on, a previous owner may have disconnected the CEL to cover up a problem.  If the CEL light works, but it's not tripping a code, I'd start by pulling spark plugs and see if one or two cylinders isn't firing properly (look for soot or otherwise fouled plugs)  If the plugs look good or all are fouled, I'd start looking at timing, fuel pressure, intake/vacuum leaks, and testing cam, crank, and O2 sensors.  A shop may have to help you with those."

Miata,3dna7x,lackofagoodname,6,Fri Jul 17 17:35:06 2015 UTC,"IMO, at least look into flyin miata, begi or even the mkturbo kits. Used kits from any of these vendors would even be a better value. Mkturbo is new, so there may not be used kits out there yet.   Tons of info in miataturbo site, but be warned, they dont spoon-feed people there. Most of the answers have already been posted, so do tons of searching and reading first. Check their classifieds.   Once you have decent kit or parts, you should also prepare for clutch, intercooler, ECU and wideband gauge. Some have been successful using Flyin Miata voodoo box. Exhaust on a turbo car always helps. 3"" is highly recommended."
Miata,3dna7x,bogly,9,Fri Jul 17 19:53:58 2015 UTC,"Seriously? Sigh....  Im going to try my best to not be mean about this.   Okay, to start off, you know absolutely nothing. Fuck all nothing. You idiot.   Okay, now that is out of the way. Ill explain and list information.  1) That kit is garbage, dont waste the money.   2) There is a TON that goes into turboing an NA engine/car and that ""turbo kit"" is a very small portion of that.  Okay, to turbo a car you are going to need many things. But for the most part there are 3 core parts.   There is the actual turbo and hardware. So a turbo manifold, the turbo itself, the turbo downpipe/exhaust, oil lines, and intercooler piping and intercooler. Some cars may also need a MAF upgrade so that will be included in here. Okay, Thats the hardware.   The second big part is fuel. You need to beef up the fuel system to meet the higher fuel demands. Some cars just need injections, some will need more like new fuel rails, adjustable fuel pressure regulators, and new fuel pumps. Needs vary based on car and how far you are taking things power wise.   thirdly, you need a way to tune it. For a miata this means a full standalone ECU (very pricey and complicated). This will allow you to have full control over the engine management and adjust fuel, timing, etc.   Thats it. That is the BASICS of a turbo setup.  Personally, you should not be turboing a car. Not a chance in hell you will ever actually complete it. Stay away from cheap kits like the one you linked. They are junk. That turbo is chinese shit that wont last long. They list it as a T28 because its roughly the same size as a Garret T28, it IS NOT a Garrett turbo. If you were to buy a complete turbo kit that JUST contains the hardware, expect to spend considerably more. Or like lots of people you can piece a kit together yourself for way cheaper, but you have to really know what you are doing.   Miatas typically use Megasquirts for standalone ECUs. They can be very pricey (Used they go for about $500).  Well, I hope I had a good mix of being an asshole while supplying useful information. Looks like it was a win win for both of us."
Miata,3dna7x,Griffin-dork,2,Fri Jul 17 19:48:01 2015 UTC,"FWIW, Flyin' Miata Voodoo kits work fairly well for low amounts of power with their proprietary piggyback controller instead of a standalone. They're limited by the flow rate of the OEM injectors, though.  Also, a Megasquirt is the CHEAPEST standalone, because it's basically just an open book and you have to have a fundamental knowledge of how EFI works to use it. Ones that offer more advanced tuning functions like AEM cost into the thousands.  Also, on a 1.6L car there are a lot of supporting modifications necessary or the car will not work well even with the engine properly built and tuned. The 1.6 clutch is no good, you need at least a Mazdaspeed clutch and preferably something like an FM Happy Meal. The 1.6 diff WILL break with turbo power. The stock radiator is too small for a turbo car.   Super solid post."
Miata,3dna7x,AKADriver,0,Fri Jul 17 20:52:29 2015 UTC,"I knew almost everything you said (I didnt know about the voodoo piggy back) but I was just giving OP a basic overview in general about what makes up a ""complete"" setup. Every car has different needs, but yes, the miata needs a lot for an NA to T setup. Especially with a 1.6 car.   Kind of makes me jealous of my 240sx with a KA. SO easy to turbo. beyond stupid easy haha."
Miata,3dna7x,Griffin-dork,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:56:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I was just giving him more reasons to go back and do more research. Everyone thinks a turbo kit or an engine swap is easy when they look at the initial buy-in but no one thinks of the support work.  Definitely a lot of things easier in the 240SX world."
Miata,3dna7x,AKADriver,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:01:15 2015 UTC,"Yeah. Even my 1.8 swap in my NA. About as simple as it gets when it comes to a motor swap. Still a ton to do. Get the motor, check that its good, replace gaskets, waterpump, and timing belt. Swap/modify everything to go in such as welding a bung for the O2, drilling and tapping holes for the 1.6 Throttle body, swapping some other sensors. Then you can finally bolt the tranny on with a new clutch and put it in the car. That required a million things. Turboing a miata requires approximately two million things, maybe more lol."
Miata,3dna7x,Griffin-dork,0,Fri Jul 17 23:35:55 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the info, and I never really claimed to know anything. I said ""from what I know"", which obviously is next to nothing. The kit I linked was an example, and like I said I'm not doing this for at least 5 months so it wasn't at all set in stone.   As for whether or not I'd be able to do this, you wouldn't know. I have the physical capability to do it, just (obviously) not the knowledge yet, hence asking this ~5 months in advance.   This is a lot easier than searching through threads in forums from years ago, as I can ask questions and get relatively quick answers. I was looking to be pointed in the right directions, not to be immediately shot down for not reading into everything first.   And considering I put nothing in my post along the lines of ""I know what I'm doing so don't try to tell me I'm wrong"", I'd say most of your post was just you being an asshole. Thanks for the useful information though, and when the car is converted next year without ruining shit I'll be sure to post here."

There are NUMEROUS threads about how to turbo a miata specifically. So you really are an idiot for not looking first. People don't want to help those that can't help themselves.  You were totally correct about the asshole part though. I really wanted to be an asshole. Because you deserved it for not at least trying to help yourself first.

Miata,3dna7x,Griffin-dork,-3,Sat Jul 18 03:25:45 2015 UTC,"No. Just no.   If you read something and have a question. You then google that. Then if you have more questions, you google those.

Any single fucking thing you could possibly want to know you can learn. Learning how to do something to a car, thats been out for 20+ years, with a cult following, and endless build threads and information, is insanely easy actually when you consider the resources.   If you take any single thing from anything I've said, and this doesn't have to do with cars, take away that if you want to do anything, the first step is having the drive to do it for yourself. Not have it handed to you like some spoiled 16 year old girl who relies on others to give her everything."
Miata,3dna7x,StayRiceForLifeBro94,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:34:55 2015 UTC,"How is asking people for info any different than asking Google the same thing? Either way I'm learning and not having it handed to me. If that was the case, I would end up paying close to 2x the amount to get someone else to do it, but instead I'm doing it myself (probably not by myself though, I'll get another set of eyes). And the first few threads from Google were just people saying ""this gets asked all the time"" and not providing links to the ones that are actually informative. I did find things not pertaining to the Miata, but I'll look more in a little. After all, I have plenty of time."
Miata,3dna7x,miatainkansas,-4,Sat Jul 18 04:47:48 2015 UTC,You are incredibly dense
Miata,3dna7x,Griffin-dork,0,Sat Jul 18 05:04:28 2015 UTC,"I understand what you're saying, it was my word choice that was poor. I just prefer getting recent answers then from reading a thread from 2006 (which is what I found), as a lot can change in 9 years. In other threads I've looked in for options with seats, exhaust, etc, some had broken links or include brands that don't exist anymore. Of course not many new products will be coming out for a 24 year old car but 9 years can still make a difference"
Miata,3dna7x,miatainkansas,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:53:04 2015 UTC,1  Learn   2  bigger radiator like a mishimoto  3 upgrade fuel pump to higher liters per minute   4 mazda rx8 injectors fit and can support turbo fuel needs completely drag and drop  5 intercooler   6 intercooler piping   7 ecu like mega squirt that have load settings for a turbo already installed so that's the last of tuning you will need to do just plug in the mega squirt and call it a day for tuning... Yes you can tune further but it's not necessary  8 1.8l differential because the 1.6 will explode   9 new drive shaft is not a bad idea because the new torque can break it   10 new clutch to a performance like excedy stage 2 which is stiff as fuck but necessary   11 mazda rx8 MAF will fit complete drag and drop   12 drill and tap an oil line for the turbo in your oil pan   13 do a complete tune up of your car example new plugs wires air filter fuel filter oil filter belts etc   14 manifold go stainless they are lighter and louder on exhaust notes but you might want to get heat shielding   15 choose a turbo   16 install the turbo   17 connect everything   18 double check everything is installed and correct placement if you want take it to a shop to double check   19 everything looks good?   20 drive the bitch like you mean it... No I kid I kid you should drive with caution till everything gets settled then after about 100 miles or so then you can drive it like you stole it   Bonus 21 you don't need a boost gauge but you can if you want to show off to people it's completely fucking worthless imho the ecu does everything for you   22 you can raise and lower boost with a boost controller which is also useless because for fun 10lbs of boost with no controller is fun enough now if you want to push 35lbs you are driving the wrong car to do so.   23 blow off valve if you want to be rice not all people want to be rice I recommend it but it's not necessary   24 I'm forgetting something but I'm too high to remember sorry man   Someone feel free to add to my list if you want.

Miata,3dion2,virtualracer,3,Thu Jul 16 17:32:00 2015 UTC,"Thanks you! The Primera will be update very soon as well with better 3D interior and updated physics ;) For the Miata we would like to do the same, maybe the future will allow to do so."

Miata,3djxmr,scarr3g,3,Thu Jul 16 21:41:00 2015 UTC,I would personally install the 1.6 for now while you look for parts to make the 1.8 a limited slip. Worst case scenario you blow up the 1.6 diff.
Miata,3djxmr,gumert,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:01:06 2015 UTC,That was my thought.
Miata,3djxmr,ToughenedTitties,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:59:18 2015 UTC,The vlsd swap will take less time than the 1.8 conversion. Just wait till you get a torsen to do the 1.8 swap.
Miata,3djxmr,ksuzzo,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:32:45 2015 UTC,Thanks. So far you are all agreeing with the thoughts I had.
Miata,3djxmr,jjjenningsiii,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:59:44 2015 UTC,So far the consensus is wait to do the swap until I get lsd guts for the 1.8 seems logical.
Miata,3djxmr,miatainkansas,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:00:41 2015 UTC,the VLSD is great for autocross if you want to run in STS class. Otherwise...

Miata,3dl2qn,ten24,1 point,Fri Jul 17 04:06:16 2015 UTC,I know it's the clutch it's a brand new one. I just want to know why a new clutch is making this noise? Is it common for new clutches or is this clutch just cheapo? The clutch grabs near the top so it is indeed new I know this much is true.

When the top developed a rip, I removed the entire mechanism and bolted a hardtop on. Still love it just as much. To each their own."

I just bought this JVC unit, which I picked because it has rear USB & aux ports that I am going to extend into the arm rest (I don't like cables flopping around by my shifter), it does bluetooth, has a pause button (the main wheel - you'd be amazed how many units these days can't pause!), variable color lighting, removable faceplate, and it looks relatively clean: http://www.crutchfield.com/p_105KDA95BT/JVC-Arsenal-KD-A95BT.html?tp=5684  You can get a Scosche adaptor for about $15 that will adapt the stereo harness to your factory harness, but it'll require a little modification if you have a Bose system; life will be easier if you don't have the Bose amp: http://forum.miata.net/vb/showthread.php?t=272802  I'm going to do my install this weekend and will try to post some pics up.  Edit: If you don't care about a rear USB/aux port, you can get a great JVC/Kenwood/Pioneer receiver for around a hundred bucks - just put in your car model and sort by price.

Miata,3dj0zf,dr2fish,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:42:45 2015 UTC,"Virtually any single DIN head unit on the market will work and mount perfectly in the car, unless you have the Bose amplifiers.  Do NOT use the Metra Mazda install kit pn 99-7505 for the radio that Crutchfield and other stereo shops supply. It mounts the radio 1/2"" down from the top of the slot for some stupid reason and doesn't leave room for gauges. The radio itself should come with a DIN sleeve, use that.  If you do have the Bose amplifiers you have two choices:   Remove them, bypass them, and install new speakers because the Bose speakers are proprietary... search ""Bosectomy"" Use an adapter that converts the head unit output to the weird balanced line level that OEM Bose amps use (it's not the same as aftermarket amp line level).    is there anywhere I can find the factory Small Tupperware side skirts? Like this   Used parts dealers like Planet Miata. I think they've been discontinued by Mazda (and when they were still available new they were expensive)."

Real hard to explain, but they're like little rubber pieces that come out about 2 inches from the radiator and sit in a bracket to keep them still, similar to the way an anti-roll bar sits in it's bracket. The radiator sits in those two brackets, bolts up near the top on both sides, and usually has some stupid brackets holding the rad in place at the very bottom, usually off the A/C lines. If you have your radiator completely out, look down on the sides where the rad bolts in, you will see these little C shaped brackets. Buying new ones is gonna be a pain to find I bet, call the dealer IMO"

Miata,3df9et,uramug1234,2,Wed Jul 15 21:13:16 2015 UTC,Heated glass window is great. Especially if you live somewhere like the northeast. Snow clears off real well and it even works in the rainy fog stuff too. There are simple methods for adding the wiring too if your car didn't come with it.
Miata,3df9et,Sunburst34,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:55:40 2015 UTC,"I put a zippered glass window top with defroster on my 95 and I love it. I can see out the back now! When I had a plastic window, morning dew would cloud it up, snow and ice would cover it, etc.  And plastic is brittle in the cold and likely to crack when you try to get snow and ice off of it.    I don't see the point of glass without a defroster, tho. If you aren't getting the defroster, then stick with the lighter weight and lower cost of plastic.   Your 92 already is wired for a defroster. You will need to get the switch that goes in the dash, the relay (goes in the trunk on passenger side near antenna), and the pigtail that connects the glass to the defroster plug on the rear deck (behind the driver's seat of a LHD car)."

Miata,3debbk,tyllsny,1 point,Thu Jul 16 07:33:45 2015 UTC,"I'm sure a lot of you have removed your stereos, and from everything I've read it's a simple process - stick in the u-shaped removal tool, and out it pops, just like the dozens of other car stereos I've removed.  This one has me stumped though - the driver side feels like it might be free, but I can't get any sort of latch to pop free on the passenger side.    Took this picture from the passenger wheel well after taking off the glovebox, and I still can't see anything that can be sprung free - I don't need to remove those two philips screws, do I?  Tried watching from behind as I inserted the tool* and I still can't see what's supposed to pop to free the deck up.  Input welcome and appreciated!  *yeah yeah"
Miata,3debbk,AKADriver,2,Wed Jul 15 16:34:49 2015 UTC,"So, the tool is supposed to be inserted only about half a centimeter in. Then you barely pull the tools away from each other and then pull towards you. I was mistaken the first couple times I tried and thought that the tools are supposed to immediately allow the radio to slide out, but that's not how it works.   Hope this helps."
Miata,3debbk,tyllsny,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:53:27 2015 UTC,"Thanks - I've tried inserting them to different lengths, but generally deeper than that.  Do you remember if they should be straight in or at any sort of angle?  Just feels like there's nothing behind there that the tool is engaging."
Miata,3debbk,AKADriver,2,Wed Jul 15 17:37:21 2015 UTC,Straight in. Sounds like it's getting stuck between the clip and the frame of the radio.
Miata,3debbk,dpidcoe,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:53:00 2015 UTC,"Ok - it more feels like it's not contacting anything at all, though when I watch it go in from the side it seems to be sliding between the big black clip and the silver metal of the stereo."
Miata,3debbk,dpidcoe,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:06:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you just want it to slide in. The black clip IS the part that holds radio in. You slide it straight into the little holes and then you angle the tools away from each other and pull straight out. Angling the tools pulls the black clips towards the radio, freeing the head unit."
Miata,3debbk,svetki,2,Thu Jul 16 03:42:03 2015 UTC,"The big black clip is what you're springing free. The two points at the top and bottom where the clip is folded in have folded lips that are hidden from this angle. The ends of the removal tool are supposed to sit against these lips, then you push outward on both removal tools at the same time to disengage the whole clips from the dash (the tan plastic) and pull straight out.  This guy did it with tiny screwdrivers but it gives you a better idea of where the removal tool is supposed to sit in the clip.  You have to release both sides at once or the side that's not free will get wedged tight. It sounds like that's what happened. It's also possible to insert the removal tools at an angle and miss the lips, then the clips won't compress.  You could remove those screws and it'd come free, but you don't need to. If you can get your hand in there you could push the clip inward."
Miata,3debbk,uramug1234,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:51:44 2015 UTC,"Awesome answer, thanks.  I did try reaching in and shoving on the clip but it didn't budget.  I'll try again when I have a little more time this evening.  Thanks!"
Miata,3debbk,uramug1234,2,Wed Jul 15 18:04:22 2015 UTC,"Reach in there with your fingers and push the clip towards the radio (you may have to use a screwdriver to push on it if you can't get the reach or the leverage). If it's like when I pulled mine out (also an NB bose system), the clip got bent slightly outwards and the removal tool is wedging in between the clip and the unit instead of into the little slot on the clip.  Basically to get mine out I ended up removing the drivers seat for extra room (it's like 4 bolts, super easy), then crawling under the dash and pushing on the clip with a short, stubby screwdriver. It popped right out after that, and I could clearly see where the clip had bent slightly and rendered the removal tool ineffective."

I haven't been meticulous about cleaning the car and rust is forming on the wheelwells and underbody - it won't look great in a few years. I've accepted it as a part of DD'ing it year round but if you want to keep the car in good shape, you have to be vigilant about cleaning it (or keep it garaged)."

The two things that make winter driving in a Miata bearable for me are snow tires,rear  and a hard top.  While you're still in Cali, look for a cheap hardtop to take with you. They help the interior stay warm, reduce any fear of the soft top collapsing under a mountain of snow. And most importantly, give you good rear visibility.   As for the snow tires, look for some cheap Daisies now, and then pick up whatever set of tires go on sale before winter. It's much more convenient to swap a set of wheels, than it is to remount tires twice a year. It also gives you a good reason to put a set of sticky summer only tires on the other set of of wheels ;)"
Miata,3delsg,emptyminded42,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:41:44 2015 UTC,"No, I would say you didn't over pay for that condition. As to the power steering, does it take two hands to turn the wheel when the car isn't moving, and is it a workout at low speeds (like parking)?  If ""yes"" then you don't have power steering. As for the winter, I'm in Texas, so I don't have personal experience, and my advice here is (extremely) limited.  But from everything I've read and heard, just slap some Blizzaks on it and it should handle fine. Rust...that I'm not sure about.  I'd say look into undercoating, including the wheel wells, and possibly even get some mud flaps so you aren't throwing bits of ice/pebbles/salt and scratching the paint and starting rust there. I know literally nothing (prices, complexity, etc) about undercoating other than it's supposed to help rust though, sorry.  Good luck with the trip, with Uni, and have fun with the car!"

Miata,3decsi,IAmInACubicle,3,Wed Jul 15 16:43:06 2015 UTC,"If your goal is fun driving on a budget, and you don't particularly care to learn more about suspension for a few years, get the FM Vmaxx and call it a day.  I would probably recommend this.  It'll do what you want, and when (if, for most people) you can articulate something you don't like about it, then move on to a Koni/GC setup.  I have driven this setup on autocross courses only, but it has many, many spectacular reviews on the street and is no slouch on course.  If you get K/GC, for spring rates you are looking at around 550lbs as the maximum the Sport dampers can control adequately.  So if you were to go for a super-serious autocross build you'd need revalved fronts or -Race fronts, which adds about $200 to the total package.  For a casual autocrosser [still very good] plus more compliant back road ride, lighter spring rates and Sport shocks are fine.  500/350 is a common pairing, as is 375/250.  I have driven this setup (Race/Sport 700/440springs) thousands of miles on the street and 200+ autocross runs, but previously raced/drove Miatas on other suspension setups for 3 years prior and learned/researched what I wanted."

Since you say 'eventually autocrossed', implying you have not yet, you won't miss it there either.  If you're planning to seriously autocross the car, yes of course you want the adjustability.

While I had fun messing around with rebound damping and educating myself, I eventually went back to the FM recommended settings and they have stayed there since then. I would skip the adjustable coilovers, unless you REALLY want the option to change spring rates in the future. I like them quite a bit now that the rest of the car is dialed in, and they handled the Sebring full course last month very well. Sebring is super bumpy, so it's a good test for them. The only issue I've had is that the adjusters can be hard to turn...another reason to stick with the fixed dampers.   There is one guy in here (same moron from one of my recent posts) saying that V-Maxx is a rebranded Raceland shock...this is totally false. I know this bc I actually pulled the trigger on a set of Racelands back when I was a noob and they took a crap after about 3-4 months of autocrossing. They merely look similar. VMaxx have held strong and consistent for about a year so far."

Miata,3decsi,miatainkansas,2,Thu Jul 16 00:54:51 2015 UTC,"I haven't dealt with both. I haven't even dealt with Koni/GC, but I have dealt with Konis on stock springs.  I would like to point out that Koni Yellow shocks have a choice or three different ride heights with the stock springs.  One setting is stock. One setting it stock (Bilstien). And the third is a little more than 1"" lower that stock (it's like 1"" at the shock, the but the shock:wheel ratio is not 1:1, It's more like 1:1.25 or 1:1.5.  So 1"" lower at the shock is greater than 1"" at the wheel.  Out of the box, the Konis are good (maybe a tad overdamped) for stock springs, and they can be adjusted to accomodate stiffer spring rates. IDK the range of compatible spring rates on the Miata off the top of my head, but you can call or email Koni's tech support and they can tell you. On my other car ('92 Civic) the Konis are good for stock ~150lb/in springs, all the way up to 500lb/in springs. Miatas are probably similar. 500lb/in springs on a light weight car are too stiff for the road IMO...  So any time you want to in the future, you can buy and install a GC kit and get stiffer springs and adjust the Konis to suit the stiffer springs.  And in the future if you want to go crazy stiff - like maybe 2 or 3 times stiffer than the stock springs - you can send the Yellows to Koni in Ohio and they can revalve them for just about any rate you ask for.  I love Koni Yellows on stock springs. I have that setup on two different cars - both of which I do spirited driving and autocross in. They are very easy to dial in at an autocross. They're very high quality. They're lifetime warranty - even if you do motorsports. And they're not too stiff for my girlfriend to drive the 1990 Miata 100 miles every day to work.  If budget is a concern, and you're not trying to go super low or super stiff, I'd do Koni Yellows now, try them for a while to see how you like them, and then upgrade with GC down the line if you find you actually need stiffer springs."
Miata,3decsi,jjjenningsiii,2,Wed Jul 15 17:03:45 2015 UTC,"I definitely plan on going stiffer than stock springs, that's not even a question really, if I don't go with coil-overs at all it'll be a Koni + H&R Race combo, but for the price it's looking like either K/GC or Vmaxx is the better option than a shock/spring combo."
Miata,3decsi,ham-wallet,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:21:00 2015 UTC,"I run the FM Vmaxx Xtreme track set (the adjustable ones with 504/334 lbs springs front and rear) and they are great for autocross and dailying. I've had mine for a little over 2 years with consistent monthly autocrosses and they haven't shown any signs of wearing out. They're probably the cheapest set of coilovers I would recommend and the only reasons I went with them when I was researching suspension for my car was price and they are supposed to be ""tuned"" for Miatas. From my understanding FM takes the shocks from Vmaxx and they revalve them so they are better suited for Miatas and the spring choices they use. However if you talk to a lot of serious autocrossers you'll find that the koni/GC combo is very popular. I can't speak for it, but I figure I'd give my insights on the Vmaxx."

There's people that probably have close to 6k track miles on HPS's.   I ditched the HPS's I had on the front of my car because I hated them with a passion. They were kind of sketchy on the street (don't won't all that well stone cold), dust like crazy and have terrible pedal feel.   I switched to StopTech Street Performance pads and like them much better. They work stone cold on the street, and have much better pedal feel for autocross (far fewer lockups). I'm on my 3rd season with them - 60 events - and they still have another year or two of life left in them. The rears are still HPS and look almost brand new with even more events on them."

Miata,3dexgh,Jdruu,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:07:00 2015 UTC,"I had a $10k budget and color preference for anything but red. You can see how that worked out for me, lol.  I used cargurus.com mainly. I like the market analysis feature they have. Gives you an idea what the car is actually worth. Don't be afraid to look in a wide area too. I ended up flying to PA from GA to get mine and drive it back because it was such a good deal it turned out to be worth it. For your price point that might not be the case, but expanding to a driveable few hundred miles might help.  I like my NC1, I'd recommend getting one if you can find a decent one in that pricepoint, otherwise you'll be looking at later model NB's and you might even find a mazdaspeed in that price range, but I don't know."

Miata,3dczbb,UnseenK,14,Wed Jul 15 08:24:08 2015 UTC,"I have an NA, one of my best friends has an NC. We both swap cars often because we love MX5s and experiencing what the other has to offer.   The NC I could live with daily. It just doesn't require that much effort at all to drive compared to my NA (no p/s, no abs, no torque). The NC is stupidly quick compared to the NA. I mean, on a twisty road I have to absolutely belt my NA and even then it won't catch an NC that is just chillin' (his is modified lightly). The driving position is also 10x better than my NA. I mean you can like leave this thing in third gear and use the torque to pull it, don't even think about doing that in my 1.6. So many things I like about the NC but still there's something that always gets me back to my NA saying 'yep, this is the best car in the world, I made the right choice' hahaha.  My NC mate's impression of my NA: Everything feels so mechanical in here. The accelerator pedal has resistance, gearbox is notchy and requires effort to shift (I have a short shift), and if you don't get it in the powerband or right gear it feels like balls. But something feels special about this car especially the way it sounds when you rev it. It takes a lot of effort to drive compared to the NC, but feels more rewarding.  If you have to drive one everyday I would pick the NC. Best way to know is drive one yourself and decide. Either way it's an MX-5/Miata so you can't go wrong, unless you choose a NA/NB auto haha."

Miata,3dczbb,Sean5294,3,Wed Jul 15 13:08:09 2015 UTC,"One of the guys I know at work has an NC (I may or may not have had a hand in this), and I ofc have my NA. If I'm honest I do get a little jealous of the NC, it's leather, very comfortable, nippy, reasonable on petrol, looks sexy, everything is electronic and easy to use, it is unfortunately a flappy paddle six speed auto, so there's that, but it's still enjoyable to drive non the less. In simple terms, the NC in my experience, is very comfy, reasonably powerful, pretty much everyone loves it, it's reliable (never been to the shop aside from servicing from what I've been told), and you can take it anywhere, no one will bat an eye lid, but mine on the other hand, you can't take it anywhere, if people aren't taking pictures, they're giving me looks like I'm about to bite someone and talk about tin foil hats, or writing me a ticket, but I wouldn't trade my little precious for anything, there's just something about the simple mechanicalness of it that gives it this alive feeling, I don't know if it's because I know all about it and spent so much time driving and working on it, but I've formed a sort of attachment to it, all other cars I've driven, worked on and semi owned were tools for fun, but there's something about these cars which makes you love them, although my one gives me the shits sometimes, it's a bit cramped in there at the moment because I have the stock seats in, it's a nightmare in city traffic and I have panic attacks leaving it places because it doesn't have the high tec alarms like the nc.  I probably would bite someone if they messed with it.  Tldr, if you want comfy, care free fun, get an nc, if you want the full balls out enthusiast's experience and don't mind putting up with the little things involving owning an older car, get an na.  and if you want an s2000 but don't want a filthy Honda get an nb :D"
Miata,3dczbb,Arkapella,3,Wed Jul 15 12:22:59 2015 UTC,"I love my NC. Sometimes I toy with the idea of getting some mods on it, maybe some suspension stuff, but honestly, having the fastest best handling car on the road isn't my priority. Really, i'm awful happy with it stock. It seems plenty fast to me. It rips around the turns on hwy 1. the soft top on the NC is the best operating top i've ever seen.   I'm probably never going to upgrade anything on it as i'm not racing, but there are some serious mods you can do to the thing. goodwin racing sells a drop in 2.5l engine that's supposed to turn it into a rocket for what it would cost you to turbo up an NA or NB."
Miata,3dczbb,Shadowratenator,2,Wed Jul 15 17:51:38 2015 UTC,I previously owned a 2012 NC and it was totalled by some lady running a red light and T-Boning me...  I had it for 3 years and loved it to death.  It was extremely fun to drive and comfortable to be in for extended time periods.  But I just replaced it with my new to me 93 NA and would say that it is just as fun to drive.  It is definitely more cramped in the NA and less comfortable for extended times in the car but I wouldn't trade it for anything besides another Miata.  I love my NA because I can modify the cap out of it myself.  Recently installed a whole new sound system and love it.(see my recent post about it on r/miata)  The NC I had was bone stock and drove amazingly.  I miss it everyday.  But for nearly a quarter the price I got my NA and the amount of fun it provides is unbeatable for the price.  But essentially what I am saying is if you want an NC get an NC they are beautiful cars that handle great and are just plain fun to drive.  But you also can't go wrong getting a NA.  I love me some pop up headlights.  It all comes down to personal preference and my preference is Miata of any form.  Hope that helped.  Any questions about either my NA or my lovingly missed NC let me know.
Miata,3dczbb,BenTheFox150,2,Wed Jul 15 14:34:10 2015 UTC,Did you have a soft top NC? What's the road noise like compared to the NA?
Miata,3dczbb,Squilliam_Fancysonn,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:39:55 2015 UTC,I did have a soft top.   I'd say it was better in a NC but my NA has a rip in the soft top and stiff suspension so I can't say compared to a stock NA
Miata,3dczbb,BenTheFox150,1 point,Thu Jul 16 12:54:03 2015 UTC,"I sold my 1.6L NA about 5 years ago and just purchased an NC 2 weeks ago.  My opinion is that everything feels familiar but more modern, and in many ways better.  As others have said, the NA feels more mechanical and you feel more connected, but that's pretty much the only advantage it has.  The NC is a bit softer, a bit heavier, a bit bigger in general, but those are positives to me.  Daily driving, the NA feels like murder.  Going over bumps it feels like the car is going to collapse in on itself, you have to belt it from every stoplight just to keep up with normal traffic.  The NA doesn't have clearcoat, so the paint is easily damaged by rocks and the sun, and it's trickier to buff out because you have so little paint to work with.  The NC still feels like a Miata.  The driving position is similar but more comfortable for average and larger-sized drivers.  It still corners like it's on rails, there's no body roll.  The NC's engine sounds great and has a great powerband.  The pedals are super responsive and accurate and the transmission shifts like a dream.  So you get most of the awesome things about driving a Miata with the benefit of having a modern, reliable, comfortable car.  If you were looking to make a autox exclusive car, I'd probably say go with an NA, but if you're planning to commute with it, get an NC."
Miata,3dczbb,vehementsquirrel,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:35:33 2015 UTC,"I driven a couple close to stock NBs, my NC, and ridden in modified NAs, NBs, and NCs. Honestly they are all pretty nice, but the NC stock suspension is pretty soft and in my opinion needs to be upgraded. There is a lot of body roll. I've ridden in NCs setup for C-Street with Koni Yellow Shocks, Stock Springs, and a big front sway bar, and they handle much better, flatter, and more capable. I've also ridden in a NA with Koni Yellows with Coilover sleeves and stiffer springs and that ride was a bit stiffer, but was still nice. The biggest thing the NC has over the NA or NB is the power.  Also, are you only DDing it or will you be doing autocross or track driving? I'd suggest the NA/NB in that case since the aftermarket parts are cheaper, more used parts available. The NC rollbars are much more expensive or not usable with a hardtop.  Have you driven any stock or modified miatas? That might help to point in a better direction?"

I have the panorama window which is a lot bigger than the stock one you get, and it's all one solid piece. It's ~$550 from what I remember. Buy it with rain rails, I heard installing them yourself is a nightmare.   Installing the top myself took two days, but I started really late in the afternoon and it was also 40°F, so the top wasn't wanting to stretch at all. It really shouldn't take more than a day at the most in warmer weather. I didn't research much either, I just started to unbolt stuff.  Link to a few soft tops on Moss Miata"
Miata,3dbl4l,SillWmith,2,Wed Jul 15 06:31:49 2015 UTC,Yeah I've been looking at the Robbins soft tops and liked them the best so far from what I've seen online.  Is the panorama version worth it over getting a glass window with defroster?  It's a plastic window in the panorama version correct?
Miata,3dbl4l,AKADriver,2,Wed Jul 15 13:58:44 2015 UTC,"If you go zipperless get glass. A zipperless plastic window top (especially one with a bigger-than-OEM window) depends on the plastic flexing, and it'll wear out before the rest of the top does.  For the seat sliding back into the sub: on NA 1.8s and early NBs (maybe '94-'02?) they put a little angle bracket on the seat rail to stop the passenger seat from sliding all the way back, because the NA 1.8 mounted the ECU to the bulkhead behind the passenger seat.  I love those flat subs for cars with small interiors. Great choice, IMO."
Miata,3dbl4l,SillWmith,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:48:27 2015 UTC,Gotcha.  I was planning on getting glass anyways because I miss the defroster my NC had.

Miata,3d94f9,32BitWhore,40,Tue Jul 14 17:21:52 2015 UTC,"I was 18 when the NA Miata came out. I drove a Triumph Spitfire 1500. I was obsessed with Triumphs and Healeys and MGs and old Lotuses.  The Miata came out and instantly my Spitfire seemed obviously second rate.  I knew instantly that the Miata was every bit as fun as my Spit and way faster and got better fuel economy and would be more relible.  I wanted one SOOOO bad.  After that I had some Datsun Roadster - the original ""immitation Japanese sports car"". Those things were too close to the original formula. They didn't leak oil like a Brit, but they had the same damnable SU carbs.  For 25 years I looked at NAs and I knew that whatever car I had, whatever I was trying to do with it, any NA Miata could do it better.  I met my girlfriend 10 years ago. She has an MGB. I told her from the get-go - Yeah, the MGB is cool, but it's not as cool as an NA Miata.  B-b-but the MGB is a classic! B-b-but chrome bumpers! B-b-but ""real thing"" not cheap asian knockoff!  Yes. But driving the MGB means moving all the daily driver cars out of the driveway, getting the battery jumper out, putting a charge on the battery, priming the carbs, airing up the tires, wiping the dust off, then getting the MGB out, putting all the daily drivers back in the driveway, driving the MGB for 2-6 hours, and then moving all the cars out of the driveway to put the MGB back in the garage, and moving all the cars back into the driveway.  That's a shit ton of work for a few hours of enjoyment.  The Miata is the daily driver. It's all the fun shit of the MGB - the top down, the visceral driving experience, zooming around corners - with the economy and reliability of a Mazda Protege.  It's not a cheap knockoff of the original formula.   It is exactly the original, properly executed. The Brits tried to do it for 50 years and never got it right. They gave up.  Mazda came along and was like ""is this what you were trying to do?""  And British car fanatics found a way to hate on it basically by saying it was too reliable.  Like somehow it's not a real sports car unless it breaks down and leaves you stranded on the side of the road twice a year."

Sways and tires make a huge difference on the car, I run Eibach sways ( I'm actually on AS3 tires atm ) and have no regrets. Do you have the OEM strut bar at all?

Yeah - it's apparently an american mentality to try to run one set of tires year round, vs elsewhere in the world you run winter tires for the cold weather. I learned the hard way about summer tires in cold weather. Trashed two 17x9 RPF1s and had to replace a wheel bearing as a result -_-   It's less about the snow itself as the cold weather turns them rock solid ( I had ice that would squeeze out of the rubber as I was driving ) and second to that, how cold the road itself is.   Hit up miata.net and see what pops up in the classifieds! see if you can nab a used set :)   Are you going to Miata's at the Gap at the end of the month?"
Miata,3d94f9,Stormhammer,3,Wed Jul 15 20:46:39 2015 UTC,NC ftmfw  Upgrade the sways and put on some Ohlin DFV's over some PSS tires and you will have a blast tearing up a track.  The NC is deceptively quick.

Miata,3d94f9,Stormhammer,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:51:19 2015 UTC,How's it compare to an NA or NB though? I've heard from reviewers and such that it isn't as nippy as its predecessors in stock form.
Miata,3d94f9,dumkopf604,2,Wed Jul 15 00:22:50 2015 UTC,"To be fair, I've never driven a stock one ( I bought it from the previous, and original owner, who had isntalled the mods at 6k on the odo. I have 115k now ).  I've seen pictures of the body roll an NC has stock. So, stock for stock, I'd imagine an NB or NA is more nimble, just due to weight and double wishbone all around vs the multi-link rear. Modified though, the NC seems to pull ahead. Plus, an NA has to move 18lbs per horsepower, the NC 15lbs per pony.   Main reason why I purchased an NC was I was looking at a sunburst yellow '02 SE and they were asking $12k as a dealership. Wouldn't finance it ( had 48k on the odo ). Bought my 08 for $14k with 53k on the odo a week later, it was a local Miata member, original owner and he was a meticulous engineer. Plus, PRHT + apartment was a big win for me. Haven't regretted it.   http://rallyways.com/specialty/mazda-mx5-na-miata-vs-nc-miata/ Has a decent breakdown as well."

Miata,3d94f9,dumkopf604,2,Wed Jul 15 00:20:56 2015 UTC,"The only thing I miss about the NB is it's flatter in the corners and less likely to be sneered at by Miata purists. Both the NB and NC I owned were factory loaded (sport suspension, lsd, 6sp) and the NB had far superior suspension (though far less comfortable). Otherwise, for my needs the NC is an all around better car. More get up and go when I need it, far more comfortable, doesn't bog nearly as bad with the AC on, and in my opinion has a more luxurious interior."
Miata,3d94f9,32BitWhore,1 point,Wed Jul 15 05:52:00 2015 UTC,How's the NC's road noise and handling compared to the NB?
Miata,3d94f9,Squilliam_Fancysonn,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:52:24 2015 UTC,"Road noise depends heavily on the tires I've noticed, but it's slightly better in the NC since I fixed my roof rattle. She still creaks and rattles like a 10 year old car should, but it's manageable (I have a soft top, for reference). Handling is... different. It's not bad, it's just not what I was used to with the NB. Stock, it's really designed to sit on the bump stops in a turn instead of staying flat like the NB was. There's a lot more body roll of course, but it still does very well for spirited driving in the canyons out here. It can be more fun to have a bit more oomph coming out of the apex as opposed to trying to carry more speed through the corner. It's a trade off."

Really don't know why given RWD is not popular outside of BMW's.  They have now moved on to Audi's alongside the ""alpha male"" brigade. It is so rare to see one been driven with an attitude other then ""Fuck you, got mine"" and it is usually an Audi 3 inches off your bumper with hi beams on when you are doing the speed limit at night."

Miata,3d94f9,cowhisperer,8,Wed Jul 15 06:53:10 2015 UTC,I've always thought so yes. I think the other unspoken rule beyond the 2 seat vs 4 seat is that if a car comes in a coupe form you buy the fixed roof model. There are exceptions of course but generally speaking you can't ever fault someone for buying the hardtop. Even old e types and c2 vettes and porsche 356 despite looking fantastic in convertible form look just as good if not better with a roof.
Miata,3d94f9,jjhats,15,Wed Jul 15 01:35:05 2015 UTC,Thinking about what's manly seems like one of the most self conscious activities. People should pursue what makes them happy and stop worrying about what the world thinks about them.

Whether or not its true I have no idea.   Corvette is usually for those older guys who can finally afford the car that they wanted when they were younger.

Call it clever marketing or call it the manly pursuit of MOAR POWAH, but that signaled a shift. Once the GIs other connoisseurs of the roadster began to age and move to more practical cars, this image took over. Then, the Germans began making reliable roadsters. As the article mentions, it ended the days where having a (British or Italian) roadster meant you had mechanical chops. The Mrs. could drive her husband's toy and she found that she liked it. Finally, the NA Miata came along. It's got a soft, pleasant appearance. It was affordable and within reach of anyone, removing any sense of prestige."

Miata,3dcdo2,djchexxx,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:14:39 2015 UTC,Sounds like an intermittent misfire. Check your coil and check for vacuum leaks
Miata,3dcdo2,Stitmn76,2,Wed Jul 15 22:11:59 2015 UTC,I think I figured it out. Since it's only happening at an incline a bad fuel filter maybe causing the misfire? I'll replace it to check it out
Miata,3dcdo2,Stitmn76,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:00:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah could be. Does it do it when you take a corner pretty hard? If so, check the fuel line pressure. Could be the fuel pump also."

What I enjoy about his videos is that he seems to appreciate cars from all ends of the spectrum.  You watch his One Takes and he really seems to like going from a heavily modified Miata, to an American muscle car, to an Italian supercar.  The variety and ""never know what's coming next"" is fun to watch for me.    While I disagree with your opinion, you're certainly entitled to it.  Personally I really dislike Chris Harris and don't at all understand Reddit's fascination with the guy.

A guy that is going to call a 4-year-old RS4 ""dirty"" and a ""beater"" because it needs a detailing is clearly out of touch when it comes to ""fun per dollar.""  His review of the Miata only confirmed that.  Farah is also very well off financially, however, he seems FAR more in touch with the common car enthusiast, and I think that comes through in his videos.  Some may like to see Harris hooning around in the newest Ferrari or Porsche, and while I can respect that, I much prefer watching a guy I can relate to."

His claim to fame is being a spoiled rich kid who used to have more money than sense and basically had daddy buy his way into the car world. He also reviewed a datsun 240 converted into a ferrari 250. He reviewed it and implied it was a ferrari 250 when it wasn't. He lied and said he saw the v12 but he never was able to see under hood. He did a lot of back pedaling for that and removed that video from the web. I think he's a real cool dude and appreciate his videos

Miata,3datr0,tomalapala,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:07:30 2015 UTC,Definitely make sure you have both! I didn't have comprehensive and couldn't get my windshield replaced through insurance. For collision it's better to have it and not need it than need it and not have it.  I had the car for a year before I realized I didn't have either comprehensive or collision but I'm definitely glad I added it in May; it helps lessen the heart break.

There is also race telemetry for this but the spin and subsequent stop (even though i only came to a full stop for a second) confused my software so the data is pretty unusable.
Miata,3da7rn,joelunchbucket,5,Tue Jul 14 18:30:50 2015 UTC,"Start with a '99 for top end or VVT for all around best results.  ECU - I prefer MSLabs MS3. It's the business and is no fuss. Install, VEAL tune and you're done.  Header - RB is your best $/hp option here.  Intake Manifold - EUDM squaretop for top end, '99 VICS for midrange.  Intake - make something custom that isn't hot-side.  Camshaft - BP5A intake from the MSM  That's 140-150whp. Outside of this you have to go into the engine."
Miata,3da7rn,TheMajorGITS,3,Tue Jul 14 20:14:17 2015 UTC,"This is what I'm after! Thank you. So just the intake cam from an MSM, huh? Since brand new headers are so pricey, I picked up the NB2 header last year and took a grinder to the internal welds (no idea if this makes any difference). It felt like it beefed up my mid-range, but did nothing to the top end. I should probably complete the rest of the exhaust. This might be a stupid question, but can the MSM cam be put in successfully without an ECU? Is this what people are referring to when they say ""exhintake mod""?"
Miata,3da7rn,TheMajorGITS,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:35:23 2015 UTC,"'01+ manifold is a poor mans RB. You'll gain some across the range, but not as much as the RB.  Exintake mod is taking the exhaust cam from your year car, cut the notched part for the CAS off and either drill the sprocket or getting adjustable ones. It gets relatively the same gain if you put some work in and time the cam correctly on a dyno.  If you do all of this without an ECU I expect 125-130whp. BP5A can be run without but you definitely will not realize the gains without an ECU."
Miata,3da7rn,nignog2307,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:48:42 2015 UTC,Just imitate this all-motor build.  172 whp on a stock bottom BPZ3 and BP4W head without any porting. If you do everything youself it should be pretty managable when it comes to costs.
Miata,3da7rn,ToughenedTitties,1 point,Wed Jul 15 06:58:22 2015 UTC,"Blueprint your bottom end, use NB2 pistons and a VVT head, either gut the variable intake plenum or find a jdm square top, full exhaust, and use an aftermarket ECU and that will net you at least 140hp at the wheels. 949 racing has a post about what NA mods you would need to do to get certain power ranges."

You could get some ITBs for mad street cred but compared to FI, your power gains are marginal especially considering the cost  Edit: You could always supercharge for linear power delivery if that's what you're going for"
Miata,3da7rn,boooosacknoodle,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:45:29 2015 UTC,"I get the money argument, but to me, a Miata without its original engine is no longer a Miata at heart.

I just want to make the car a little more playful, while still keeping the ""spirit"" of the car...whatever that means. And I think most important of all, I don't want any heat management issues.

You're looking at $3000+ for an FM kit with no electronics, so cost wise if you have the ability to fabricate a manifold and downpipe, it will be more effective to stick to the K04. As far as tuning, I couldn't recommend anything better than Megasquirt PnP. I actually just started a tuning series on Megasquirt for turbo Miatas on my YouTube channel if you want to check it out, released the first video literally 2 hours ago, someone posted it here on r/miata already too. Good luck, you will not regret building a turbo Miata."

I'd be completely okay with dialing that thing back some how and running just 6~7lb of boost on it, but I have absolutely no clue how.  If you have an idea as to where you could point me on that side of it, that'd be awesome.  As well as how and where I should route oil from the the 1.8.  As for the custom-fab exhaust set up, I'll probably end up cannibalizing a cheaper turbo manifold and the stock CX-7 manifold.  It won't be pretty but I can weld okay.  Hopefully I can get my welds to hold for longer than a couple hours.  EDIT Posted the same question today on miata.net and got pretty much the exact opposite of your response"
Miata,3d9lrv,TheCarPassionChannel,3,Tue Jul 14 17:30:22 2015 UTC,"Really? What were the people on miata.net saying? Hahaha, I hear stories about those guys. I'm a miataturbo.net guy myself. Does the K04 have an internal wastegate? Unfortunately if the boost is going higher than you want, you'd have to install a different wastegate actuator. Can you post a picture of the turbo? Maybe a couple angles?"
Miata,3d9lrv,TheCarPassionChannel,4,Tue Jul 14 17:42:52 2015 UTC,"""Not worth it. Ultimately designing a setup around a random cheap turbo you get is a bad idea, unless you can weld and are planning on fabbing up everything yourself.""  ""...You'd be better off either starting with a decent turbo kit or piecing one together from known good parts.""  Take it Miataturbo.net guys generally have a better attitude about homebrew turbo setups?   Also it is an internal wastegate setup.  My phone isn't wanting to cooperate to upload the pictures.  Everyone says these things put out waaaaaaayyy more boost than I need or want.  I may end up buying a T28, or completely disabling the IWG and finding a way to run an external waste."
Miata,3d9lrv,TheCarPassionChannel,4,Tue Jul 14 18:15:03 2015 UTC,"Better attitude? There's an entire sub forum dedicated specifically to home-brew turbo kits. There are many more outside-the-box thinkers on that forum when it comes to turbo applications. There are a ton of people that use K04's in the VW/Audi scene so I wouldn't say it's a ""random cheap turbo."" And worst case, you don't like it, you can hack off your flanges and weld up T25/5-bolt DP flanges. If the wastegate is fairly straightforward you can probably do minimal modification and run an 8psi gate off a Garrett or something, that will be less expensive and easier than trying to figure out an EWG setup."
Miata,3d9lrv,miatainkansas,5,Tue Jul 14 18:39:11 2015 UTC,"Excellent!  It also should be said I'm not looking for fuckmassive power.  150-160whp is all I'm really gunning for.

I asked a question to test the waters about this turbo to see if its even worth it.  Also, /u/TheCarPassionChannel did have time to type it out.  Thanks for being a chode."
Miata,3d9lrv,TheCarPassionChannel,6,Tue Jul 14 20:13:13 2015 UTC,"I do not know much about that turbo, but I've heard people making well over 200whp with it so it can't be too small. If I were you I'd take the housings off and measure the compressor wheel inducer & exducer, and turbine wheel diameter. Compare your numbers to some Garrett turbos (all specs listed on their site) and see which one it's closest too. That is, if you really are concerned about it being too small. One thing about trying to run low boost (6-8psi) on a small turbo like that is you may run into boost creep, so a ported wastegate may be necessary to keep boost under control. If you're only shooting for 160whp, what's the point in running a turbo that can make 300? I'd go as small as possible. I just picked up a smaller turbo for my car yesterday, can't wait for maximum spoolage."

Miata,3d6mpv,IAmYourDad_,6,Tue Jul 14 04:30:06 2015 UTC,"As a guy who has owned Subaru's for a long time, and knows a few Subaru salespeople: The BRZ/FRS crowd never needed to be sold on the car. They came in to to the dealership asking for the car, and barely even test drove them. The sales staff didn't have to learn about the cars at all. Take one into a dealer, and they barely know what they're looking at. The dealers didn't have to learn about them at all. Support for the cars is primarily aftermarket because no one is happy with the stock performance. Because of this: Resale for the  often modified cars is not great, and now that they're a few years into the car people are really just kind of waiting for the next generation.   Specifically with the BRZ vs. other Subarus? If you're willing to go a few years back used vs. new you can get a used STI for the price of a new BRZ. Bonus: No one will call your STI a ""Toyobaru"", and mock your lack of AWD."

Miata,3d6mpv,flictonic,2,Tue Jul 14 01:32:37 2015 UTC,It looks small (I mean it's a Miata) but the reason for my initial double take is that I'm used to my NC fill up parking spots width wise. I had to check the specs and see that the wheel base is very comparable and that the spot is just wider than I'm used to seeing. The car only looks comically small in the first pic IMO.

Miata,3dauou,karmavorous,3,Tue Jul 14 23:29:24 2015 UTC,"A few months ago my girlfriend and I recharged out 1990.  We used R134 - the refrigerant that later models are supposed to use.  In order to charge it with the R134, you'll need to (at the very least) get an R134 charging port adapter. We got ours at Autzone for about $10.  You'll also need somewhere around 24oz of R134. That was about $40.  It's pretty hard to get the conversion charging adapted onto the '90's original charging port. I had to take my jack handle and rock the engine towards the driver side while my girlfriend plugged the charging hose onto the adapter.  You are supposed to evacuate the system (draw it down with a special pump so there is a vacuum inside) before you charge it.  We didn't.  You are also supposed to replace the oil in the compressor with oil that is compatible with the R134 refrigerant.  We didn't.  The AC is pretty cold now. Probably not what it was like when the car was new, but cool enough to cool off a 95 degree day with 85% humidity to barable levels.  Our compressor might die an early death - seeing as how we're using the wrong oil. But out compressor was already making bad noises like it's due to go out, and it has lasted a few months and the noise isn't getting louder.  And when the compressor finally does die, we can replace it and do the conversion correctly.  So yeah, it basically cost us $50 and our AC went from having totally non-functioning AC to having AC that is probably 90% what it should be - cool enough for all but the hottest days..."
Miata,3dauou,tomalapala,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:03:00 2015 UTC,"You can do what was said above while keeping in mind all the caveats that were mentioned. (Althouh I'd highly recommend evacuating the system properly as the freon is awful for the environment..)  I'm in the same boat as you. My Miata is my DD, and I had my R12 converted to R134 from a local mechanic last month. He told me I'd be hard pressed to find anyone doing R12 recharges, and even if I could, it'd be hella expensive. Instead, he charged me $160 for the conversion and refrigerant recharge. Next summer, I plan to buy R134 refrigerant at an auto parts store and do it myself if I need a recharge. To me, the costs were worth it.   Some think AC and Miatas aren't supposed to go together, but when it's 80s/90s and 100% humidity, they're definitely compatible. Chicago for reference."
Miata,3dauou,CaptnBoots,2,Wed Jul 15 03:28:50 2015 UTC,"Does your car still have the original r-12 system? If so, there's not really much you can do to determine if it needs a recharge and if it does good luck finding someone who will do it for you (read: almost no one). You're other option is to convert to r-34 but then you'll have to make sure all the old refrigerant is out etc etc.   Orrrrrr, you can just ride without AC. Ask me how I know ;)   It's not impossible to do, but from what I've read it's better to save yourself the headache (and money in the long run) and convert."
Miata,3dauou,CaptnBoots,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:29:41 2015 UTC,"How much is it to convert? I thought it would be expensive and not worth it so that's why I didn't consider.

Miata,3d7952,grumpyolddude,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:39:48 2015 UTC,"As I remember, on early Miatas there are only three things that will cut off the A/C clutch, the switch in the dash (not pushed in or fan off),  the pressure sensor under the hood (must have pressure in the system) and the temperature sensor under the dash (will cut off when the evaporator is below 40 degrees to keep it from freezing up)   If you run a hot wire to the clutch and it works, then one of the other things is probably not working right.   It's very unlikely it cycles correctly because the temperature sensor is what causes it to cycle.  (one of the cooling fans under the hood may turn on and off - but not because of the A/C)    Running it with low pressure isn't a good idea either.

Miata,3d6qon,ShadowBannedXexy,2,Tue Jul 14 16:46:39 2015 UTC,"Along with what /u/goodbyekitty83 said, not only was the spool long, it didnt honestly make THAT much power. I can live with the turbo kicking in at 4k on my 1.6 if it means I'm getting 230whp to the ground and can rev till 7.5k, but if I'm making less(a lot less) than 200whp, and the rev limiter is at 6800, AND its a 1.8, thats kinda a shitty build. Anyone doing their own setup that came up with the same results would be plagued by the users on MiataTurbo.net for not setting it up right. lol"
Miata,3d6qon,MightyPenguin,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:04:32 2015 UTC,Yeah that's true. I've always wondered why it produces so little power.

With a tune the car transforms. Plenty of msm guys running 230+ whp on those stock little turbos (I'm just under 200whp with only exhaust/intake, throw a good tune and injectors and I'll be a happy guy)   Though I agree it's not the best example of a factory turbo and they could have done many things better,and I definitely don't think the Rev limiter needed lowered either. That will be nice to raise as well"
Miata,3d6qon,ShadowBannedXexy,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:53:52 2015 UTC,"I agree. Honestly I like the MSMs a lot, a beautiful car and much ""nicer"" than my old 1990 NA, but when I just wanted something fast and fun and cheap...this was the way to go. I put in a megasquirt 3x, clutch and flywheel, differential, DIY turbo kit, injectors, and more and because I bought a lot of parts used, I have a really nice setup that cost me less than 2.5k. I mean, thats not cheap, but for what I got out of it compared to new kits on Flyin' Miata and BEGi it was a great deal."
Miata,3d6qon,MightyPenguin,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:01:24 2015 UTC,That is a killer price for a good turbo setup (my wallet hurts everyone I dream about a Garrett + ms upgrade)   I like the msm for styling but also gave me a decent platform to start on and upgrade as I go.

Miata,3d6qon,ShadowBannedXexy,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:35:42 2015 UTC,"Yea well the only thing is if you have to pass emissions testing in your area where they plug into your OBDII port, you will automatically fail with a  megasquirt installed... I'm in CA but don't have to deal with that specific rule because they won't plug in.   I have thought about 1.8, and at one point had plans to do that first, then a turbo later. I ended up deciding to abandon the idea as I already have lots of parts for the 1.6, they can make just about the same power anyways with a turbo, and it would be nicer for me to just buy another 1.6 and always have a backup motor, that also will get built while the current one is in the car. Then I can share parts, parts are cheaper than for 1.8's too. If I'm really going to swap it eventually I may go v8, but we'll see."
Miata,3d6qon,MightyPenguin,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:36:26 2015 UTC,"Makes sense as far as your engine choice goes. I've though about buying a 1.8 to build as well for more boost later. But I'm only at 66k so far so it will be awhile before I have to worry about engine swap/rebuild (if I'm lucky)   And yeah I'm aware of the obd2 requirements here. I do have to go for testing once every 2 years, but swapping the ecu and at the worst injectors once every 2 years is worth it,   considering there really isn't any other option for making this car run properly"

Miata,3d6e62,tjr97,3,Mon Jul 13 22:04:56 2015 UTC,It looks like it's just getting to a point where it is more than just surface rust. The thing that really kills it is the price
Miata,3d6e62,tjr97,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:07:46 2015 UTC,How much should rust like this knock off the asking price?
Miata,3d6e62,EntroperZero,2,Mon Jul 13 22:18:39 2015 UTC,"Considering the frame still looks good and I guess after looking at it again it is not completely gone, it's tough to say what to price it at though because I am not familiar with your market   Edit: the things is though, if the rust is the only issue you have with the car then you can replace the parts that are on their way out"
Miata,3d6e62,EntroperZero,3,Mon Jul 13 22:44:51 2015 UTC,"Well, the frame looks good -- the rust protectant there seems to have held up.  But yeah, there's major corrosion to the lower control arms and rear subframe there.  The cross member on the rear subframe, in particular, looks like it's either ready to shear off on the right side, or already has once and been repaired.  And those alignment bolts will disintegrate if you try to turn them."
Miata,3d6e62,22quack,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:14:53 2015 UTC,You seem like you know what you're talking about. Approx. how much would this cost to fix (ballpark)?
Miata,3d6e62,AKADriver,2,Mon Jul 13 22:17:04 2015 UTC,"Costwise I'm not sure, I'm an engineer so I understand what everything does, but not a mechanic.  But I would want to get a new rear subframe and control arms.  And we haven't seen under the front of the car, so I dunno if it looks the same."
Miata,3d6e62,AKADriver,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:09:57 2015 UTC,"I would not bother... My 1991 NA has less rust than that and was a BITCH to do suspension work on (tossed out a control arm because it was that bad).  There will be a lot of replaced parts in this car's future, and I would pass on this immediately. Definitely consider another car."
Miata,3d6e62,69th,2,Tue Jul 14 02:26:27 2015 UTC,"at high RPMs, the ABS and seatbelt dash lights turn on and off.   This will be more complex, annoying, and (if you're not well-versed in electronics) more expensive to fix than the rust. This is a very unusual electrical problem. Might be a bad cluster, might be a corroded ground connection, might be a bad wiring harness... it's going to take a lot of time poking around with a multimeter.  Swapping out the rear control arms or even the subframe is just nuts and bolts. It's unibody rust that you need to worry about.  There is no way this is a $5000 car."
Miata,3d6e62,Sir_not_sir,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:04:34 2015 UTC,"Thanks for confirming my suspicions. I was prepared to walk away from this car besides the rust, but being in Canada, it would be helpful to improve my knowledge of what to look for when inspecting for rust.  Also, if you rev it to 3.5k RPM in neutral and let off the gas, I could hear a faint sound from the engine. It's hard to describe but it sounded a bit like sitting on an old mattress, kind of a springy scratchy sound."
Miata,3d6e62,tomalapala,2,Tue Jul 14 14:43:48 2015 UTC,"The biggest rust issues in Miatas are the rocker panels and rear fender lips just in front of the rear wheels, which rust when water gets in through the weld at the fender lip; and the trunk floor and the ""shelf"" behind the rear seats which rust when the top or rain rail leaks."
Miata,3d6e62,Creativeusername833,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:04:34 2015 UTC,"No way I'd pay $5000 for something with this much rust. It's definitely a fixer-upper. Cost to fix; it's hard to say, really. A lot of decisions to be made there. If you're really trying to remove every ounce of rust on the rear end alone, it's gonna take a lot of time, and if you don't do it yourself, a lot of money. Honestly, I'd walk away from the car just due to the time you'll have to put into it."
Miata,3d1z61,Future_Lawyer,4,Sun Jul 12 21:41:51 2015 UTC,Filling up before autox... In a Miata? You're crazy. Why load down your car with all that extra fuel weight and ruin the only advantage you have?

Miata,3d1z61,goodbyekitty83,-3,Mon Jul 13 13:51:24 2015 UTC,"Still too much.   Gasoline is ~6.3 lb/gal, NB fuel tank is 14 gal. Assuming the tank is split into exact quarters, the fuel weight would be 22.05 lbs. My NA can run with less than a gallon before the motor will fuel starve. Therefore, running the car with the gauge on E is roughly a 15 lb reduction.   I do rough fuel calculations when attending autox. My Miata will burn 2 gal/hr during flat highway travel. Most autox's for me are 1hr and 3hrs distance for me, and are within 1 mile of a fuel station. Therefore, I'll put in 2-6 gal of fuel which is more than enough to drive to and compete in an event with fuel to spare. I keep my car at home on E (it's only for competition use) that way I can always easily calculate what amount of fuel I'll arrive at my destination with."

Miata,3d1z61,taidana,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:03:57 2015 UTC,"In my opinion? Still too much. If they can do things like what they did with the nd, they could have kept it the same size. The NC is like the odd child out."

You should lube the o-ring on the oil filter before installing it.   There's oil feeds all over the block on both sides, varying by year.   Lots of things it could be."

Miata,3d5jrv,ksuzzo,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:14:06 2015 UTC,My favorite shocks are Tokico Illuminas. You can pair them with any springs or coilovers under 450 lb/in spring strength. Do some reading on what spring rates are best. Miata.net forums are your friend.
Miata,3d5jrv,miatainkansas,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:40:09 2015 UTC,"I have managed a decent setup for that budget. Used Koni Yellows for $350, FCM bumpstops for $120 (nice, but you can get honda ones that work ok for cheaper), Summit racing springs for $26.50 each (price depends on the rate you go for) and a cheap set of coil over sleeves off ebay for $54.   You will have to do some reasearch to figure out what rates and things you would want for something like that.  I am swapping over from used FM springs that I got for $100 though, so you could do something like that instead as well."
Miata,3d5jrv,stahlgrau,0,Mon Jul 13 20:49:34 2015 UTC,"I would buy new OEM billies for ~$400 and then load them up, probably with stock springs till I could afford proper sleeves and springrate. $200 is plenty for tophats and bumpstops, maybe even lowering springs.   billies can be revalved when you kill them, they can always be converted to adjustable coilovers. Don't waste a single dollar on junk, just plan better."

Miata,3d40kh,tpwalsh,10,Mon Jul 13 11:57:31 2015 UTC,"You cracked a tooth under acceleration, then when coasting it worked it way out like a loose molar.  Once it got caught between the ring and pinion all hell broke loose."
Miata,3d40kh,MaidenATL,6,Mon Jul 13 12:22:25 2015 UTC,"Could this be the scenario? While pushing it a tooth sheared off, and then it floated around until it finally go to low enough, and wedged in the area where drain plug was, thus blowing the diff apart?   That is as plausible a theory as any then. It really doesn't matter. It's broke now."

Pretty amazing that the case blew apart, I've never seen that. I would assume that a tooth had broken off and got jammed into a place which caused some sort of 'wind-up' inside the diff, resulting in it popping."
Miata,3d40kh,Griffin-dork,3,Mon Jul 13 17:21:57 2015 UTC,"The 1.6 VLSD diffs are known to be weak. If you drive them hard even with stock engines they are known to pop sometimes. Forced induction is just asking for them to blow. I have one in my car and will need to swap it out for a torsen or welded eventually. Mine is just a fun street car. 1.8 swapped. So its not a huge need right now but id like to get a torsen in it. its a shame the torsens are so expensive.   Another thought is that most of them whine a good bit before they blow, you just may not have noticed due to the whine from the supercharger."

And I can't really give a good reply... It was only 45 mins until the diff asploded. But those 45 mins were amazing. Head snapping, and glorious.   Also, do realize I am comparing them to the driver's side being 2 peices, and the pass side being 80% ripped.   I do have to say though, they easy to change... Just make sure you have a 14mm ratchet wrench, so you don't have to remove the header. (I did, Yay!) all I had to remove was the air filter, cruise, and air flow sensor, and I had full access.   Also, my shifter was WAYYYY smoother, and didn't shake all the time (of course)."

Miata,3d40kh,tpwalsh,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:44:23 2015 UTC,Is the problem isolated to the rear diff? Or does the explosion impact other parts? (I have a 1.6 and am wondering what to prepare for.)

Number 1 lesson learned? Take pictures of every bolt and where they go, then bag and label them. Also, does anyone have any idea why my car won' start unless the charcoal canister is plugged in? The funny bit is it's not even connected to the engine and this point, but if it's completely out the car won't start."
Miata,3d13jr,mschiebold,1 point,Sun Jul 12 17:25:17 2015 UTC,"Funny, I did a charcoal canister delete and mine runs just fine. All you need to do is to plug the vacuum line at the TB."

Miata,3d13jr,cluggy,1 point,Sun Jul 12 22:03:42 2015 UTC,There's a couple of hoses that need to be hooked up after you remove it but I would've thought it would just run rough even if they weren't connected.   Did you put a blank on the opening on top of the throttle body? It's not connected to the TB anymore but you still need to blank it.

Power windows switches are just forward of the armrest storage lid or if you have crank windows you obviously don't have power windows. AC button is in the center of fan speed knob.   What year? You can also call Mazda with your VIN and get a list of original equipment delivered when new off the lot. Tape deck is better than CD because you can use an aux in to play music off your phone.

Miata,3d27ug,cybrwire,1 point,Sun Jul 12 22:50:46 2015 UTC,"You can try pulling off the hub with a slide hammer, but it probably won't work to well"
Miata,3d27ug,tjr97,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:59:11 2015 UTC,"It should be removed from the hub before it's removed from the differential. If it's frozen in the hub you will need to beat the ever living shit out of it and it still probably won't come out, drivers side axles like to freeze in the hub. I also had to cut the lower control arm bolt into three pieces on my car, it was completely rusted solid between bushings.   Try the other side, maybe you can pull the differential out and just leave the drivers side stuck in the hub."
Miata,3d27ug,miatainkansas,1 point,Mon Jul 13 00:26:31 2015 UTC,Do not hit it with a hammer. You will risk mushrooming the end of your axle effectively ruining your hub and axle.
Miata,3d27ug,ToughenedTitties,2,Mon Jul 13 01:09:04 2015 UTC,"This. I had my driver's side axle stuck pretty good. I wailed on it with a deadblow (which will not mushroom it). Got frustrated that it wasn't moving, so I gave it a couple whacks with a sledge and it started to mushroom. I don't know if I didn't hit it hard enough or what, but it wasn't bad enough to cause issues. It was a poor idea   If you're ok replacing the bearing, you could just take a torch to the hub, the heat would help it expand a bit. If you did, I bet you'd cook the bearing though"
Miata,3d27ug,zeoalex,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:08:07 2015 UTC,"Alternatively, since you've already disconnected the hub from the a-arms, you can pull the axle out of the diff and put the hub in a press to press out the axle."
Miata,3d27ug,ToughenedTitties,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:56:45 2015 UTC,"Really depends on how badly you want it out. You could mushroom the axle that way too depending on how stuck it is. I believe a mixture of a press and some well applied hear did it for mine (I had a shop do it, they were pressing in/out my rear bearings, but since I couldn't separate the hub from the axle, I brought him that too)"
Miata,3d27ug,zeoalex,2,Mon Jul 13 03:59:27 2015 UTC,It would have to be basically welded in for that to happen. The difference between pressing it out and using a hammer is that the hammer is applying a shock load while the press is applying a controlled load gradually.
Miata,3d27ug,ToughenedTitties,1 point,Mon Jul 13 04:02:29 2015 UTC,How much did the shop charge for that?
Miata,3d27ug,zeoalex,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:39:01 2015 UTC,"It ended up being $100 after all was said and done (he initially asked $120 but we settled on $100...he was a nice local guy at the end of the street), which was him seperating the axle and hub, as well as pressing in/out both bearings."
Miata,3d27ug,zeoalex,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:04:50 2015 UTC,"That's not too bad. I think I'm just going to need a new hub. I had a friend come over today who is more mechanically inclined than I and he put the axle nut on and started swinging away. The axle is fine, but the nut isn't. Then we tried to get the bottom bolt off the control arm.. It mushroomed. The whole thing is just too rusty. I think any used one would be better."

Miata,3cyz9l,ultra-meta,10,Sun Jul 12 02:31:19 2015 UTC,I've had my 1990 Miata for about 6 years.  A couple of years ago I replaced the 1.6l with a 1.8 and an intercooled GT2560.  It did transform the car.  But I kind of regret it.  It was fun being able to drive it with the pedal down all the time and wind out the 1.6 at every light.  You can't do that to the same extent with a 200+ HP Miata on the street and in a way that's too bad.    I've belatedly come to appreciate the saying that it's more fun to drive a slow car fast than a fast car slow.  My other car is a 450 HP biturbo V8 and that feels the same way sometimes.
Miata,3cyz9l,fixed,8,Sun Jul 12 04:47:39 2015 UTC,"yep, went from a 400hp awd to my na6.  no desire whatsoever to turbocharge.  the miata is so great because of what it ends up being despite what it isn't from a technical perspective."
Miata,3cyz9l,Monsterpiece42,4,Sun Jul 12 06:01:38 2015 UTC,"Similar story for me. My ""3 babies"" are my ~490hp Evo 8 MR, my ~140hp AE86 coupe, and my bone stock NA6. The Miata and 86 are comparable, and a general blast to drive. The Evo naturally would eat them alive in every way but it's far too ""business"" and is much less fun. I'm actually going to be selling the Evo in the next year or so. You can bury me in my Corolla and the Miata can have the plot to my right."
Miata,3cyz9l,fixed,1 point,Sun Jul 12 12:44:03 2015 UTC,"also came from an Evo (9).  exactly right, Evo beats the NA6 technically in almost every way (excepting weight) but the NA6 is just a much more fun daily driver. my MX5 buddies think I am insane when I tell them this.  they're all wanting to turbo theirs; pretty sure me saying this is something they'll eventually regret is falling on deaf ears!

Miata,3cyz9l,Jorfredo,3,Sun Jul 12 07:48:43 2015 UTC,"I've owned a turbo'd Miata before, and while the power was nice and certainly transformed the car, it also made the car kind of fickle and unbalanced.  Part of this was that I turbo'd the car on the cheap so I didn't use a full standalone ECU, intercooler, etc.  If you turbo, you have to do it right, don't skimp out.  Also, do everything else first.  I've gradually upgraded my current Miata's suspension, brakes, and tires.  Especially with the ultra-sticky summer tires on, I've started to notice the lack of power.  Once the car's straight-line performance seems absurdly mismatched with the car's turning/braking performance, then and only then go turbo."
Miata,3cyz9l,bgiu,2,Sun Jul 12 15:58:34 2015 UTC,"Speaking of transformations, the next level is v8 swap. I got to ride in my friends turn key FM monster Miata.... It ruined my experience with my car for at least 2 days. The Torque is just too intoxicating."

Take off the wheels and soak all your nuts and bolts with it a few days prior if possible, maybe even a couple  of times to make it easier. Depends how bad yours are.  Some of the bolts on the back of the caliper were so rusted in the whole car lifted when I tried pry them out, so turn the steering wheel to get better access to the hub, then use a breaker bar.  Discs were also rusted on tight, no amount of fluid was helping there. Club hammer and a couple of good smacks and they came off.   There's a really good video on youtube with a guy who installs the braided lines on the NA miata, I used that for reference and it was really simple actually and I consider myself a novice.   I also didn't bother trying to save brake fluid from leaking I'm just going to replace the whole lot.   Copper grease for all your bolts going back in and some regular grease for the little caliper pistons.   Good luck with it, can't wait to feel my new brakes :)"
Miata,3cxzla,MijnWraak,2,Sun Jul 12 05:19:33 2015 UTC,You want silicone paste for the caliper slides not just regular grease which will eat away the rubber boots
Miata,3cxzla,Gingervitis526,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:14:57 2015 UTC,"oops! yes that's right. silicone grease comes with the pads, thanks for pointing that out."
Miata,3cxzla,rnepmc,2,Sun Jul 12 21:55:14 2015 UTC,My rear rotors were stuck on bad. Hammer would not loosen them for shit. Notice in most rotors there should be a small hole with threads. Go buy a bolt M8x1.25 and just start screwing it in until the rotor pops off. Worked like a charm and beats having to use a hammer.
Miata,3cxzla,rnepmc,1 point,Mon Jul 13 04:07:45 2015 UTC,I sprayed them with penetrating fluid every day for about a week lol   If they didn't move with the club hammer I was going to go and get some bolts and nuts and do it that way.  Your way is probably better if you've got the bits handy but as I was throwing the discs away there's no harm in giving them a tap. I heard this can damage your wheel bearings but then I also heard from many people who've had to take a sledgehammer to theirs (plus a few other mechanically minded guys) that giving them a couple of good whacks should be fine.

Miata,3cwphm,tjr97,-15,Sat Jul 11 16:28:08 2015 UTC,"Changing your wheels at the track is a waste of time.  Drive there, empty your car and go.  You aren't ""saving"" the tires.  If you are any good they are going to be toast before the tread wears out anyway."
Miata,3cwphm,stahlgrau,24,Sat Jul 11 16:23:18 2015 UTC,I think the issue is that some serious track tires aren't road-legal.
Miata,3cwphm,bombala,2,Sat Jul 11 16:27:27 2015 UTC,"Furthermore, generally track suspension setup has a lot more camber and toe, so driving 25 mile will destroy slicks."
Miata,3cwphm,Mustard_Icecream,-15,Sun Jul 12 10:41:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah, slicks aren't road legal.  If you run those tires your car should be purpose built and trailered anyway.  Mostly talking about the casual weekend racers.  People I see at the track switching tires are slow as fuck to begin with.  The sticky tires just make them a worse driver. They can't get the car to break its limit because the grip is so good."
Miata,3cwphm,stahlgrau,6,Sat Jul 11 18:14:53 2015 UTC,"I used to track with the same tires. They are Dunlop DZ101 and now I plan on having a dedicated set.  Reasons: 1. The DZ101 were not great track tires and they were shit daily driver tires. Too much road noise, terrible in the rain, but great at drifting in the rain.    I want a nice set of daily tires, with good tread wear, good grip in the rain and low road noise.  I want a nice set of track tires with great dry grip.   I can't go using Toyo Proxes as my daily tires. I'd wear them out too quickly. I only go to track days max 2 times a month, but I daily drive 15,000kms a year. A nice set of track tires should last a few years at low use. A nice set of daily tires should last a few years with current use.  But track tires wont last as daily tires, and daily tires wont last as track tires."

Its honestly no bigger than a small block and has the advantage of a lower profile intake and no distributor to interfere with the firewall like a SBC. Aluminium blocks also make it not all that much heavier than the iron block 1.6 and 1.8 engines

Shy of 150K miles and coming in at $4k. All maintenance has been done and the exterior is 100% rust free.  I personally don't intend to race it but would certainly enjoy spirited driving. Is $4k fair to go in on a raced Miata that I don't plan to race or will the modifications just end up costing me in the long run? For reference I'm in the northeast and just about everything I've seen right now is $4k maintained but with some rust or a pending timing belt/water pump maintenance, but with around 25K less miles.

Miata,3ctixw,garyhpc,24,Fri Jul 10 17:31:34 2015 UTC,"I'd like a honest unbiased opinion   We're human. You're not going to get that. The best you can hope for is an opinion with the person's biases exposed, so you can see how they color what they say.  One of the important things to know is many judge all automatic Miatas by the NA and NB automatics. Those were economy car automatics thrown into the Miata. They're not a good match for the car. Automatic Miatas of those generations still have the essential Miata-ness, but they aren't as good as their manual counterparts.  But the automatic in the NC is significantly different. It's sporty. It's a 6-speed, instead of a 4-speed, it's programmed to behave more aggressively, and the paddle shifters give you both the ability to select the gear you want and give you significant ""lock up"" (where the torque converter is locked and the drivetrain doesn't slip, like automatics can). This means you can get a lot more out of the car than with a basic economy car automatic. You still can't do clutch dumps or the like, and you still don't get the feel of the shifter, but the automatic NC is at least 9/10ths of the manual NC.   why the manual would be better for a 30 minute commute 4 days a week in Austin traffic.   Well, it's better for the rest of the time you're driving the car. You're in Austin. The Hill Country is right there. Some of the roads in Austin are wonderfully curvy and fun. Blipping the throttle and rev-matching the downshift just right as you go through that turn on Spicewood Springs is a lot of fun (even if you can't do it fast because it has a 35 mph speed limit and is now in the middle of the city). And as you get used to the manual, managing it on the commute doesn't become ""micro-managing"". It will be at first, but as you learn the manual, it becomes something you just... do. You don't have to think about it. You don't have to micro-manage it. It's just... always in the right gear, all the time, because you've put it there without really having to think about it.  If you have your heart set on an automatic, you'll be happy with an automatic NC. But if you're willing to try a manual, you'll be rewarded both with a new skill set and with a car that gives you just a little bit more."
Miata,3ctixw,equiraptor,6,Fri Jul 10 18:50:54 2015 UTC,"Agreed with everything said here.  I test drove both but went with the manual transmission in spite of having barely any experience and a 30-ish minute commute in Kansas City traffic (which is very dense, but can usually keep moving most of the time).  The automatic is very good and the NC would still be fun overall with it, but barring a physical handicap or having your driving restricted to little but the nastiest of gridlock, I can't recommend it.  The car was built around driver involvement, so pairing it with what is frequently hearlded as one of the best manual transmissions out there really helps to complete the picture.  Any enjoyment lost in traffic will be more than made up everywhere else.  I'm 6+ years in and still looking forward to driving it every single day."
Miata,3ctixw,t0ast217,13,Fri Jul 10 19:49:39 2015 UTC,"If you don't care about actually driving the car as it is meant to be driven and just want it to commute and look good, then by all means get an auto. If you are not actually into driving as a hoby or sport then it probably doesn't matter. It is still going to be a great car that should be fun to drive. The manual transmission to me is one of the great features of the car and it seems like it would be missing so much character and fun if it were automatic. It would be like owning an automatic transmission motorcycle."

This goes against what most on this sub will recommend, but the auto is a decent compromise for something that is comfortable in heavy traffic but still can be paddle shifted for fun drives on the weekend. I'd say the club is best with a manual for the most pure ""Miata"" experience, and the grand touring with automatic makes for a great cruiser / commuter that's still sporty and fun.  http://jalopnik.com/can-you-still-have-an-awesome-time-in-an-automatic-mazd-1601350276"

That's complete and total bunk. I take spirited back roads every chance I get and the transmission has never once let me down. This is the Miata subreddit so of course automatics are shit, but you know what, it's still fun, it's still spirited, and it's still a drivers car.  Get what you enjoy and ignore the frankly tiring argument that automatics are lesser cars."
Miata,3ctixw,Slev23,3,Fri Jul 10 23:27:15 2015 UTC,"The automatic in the NC isn't terrible, the manual version of the car greatly adds to the experience though. A lot of people, including myself, prefer the feeling of rowing through the gears themselves. If you're in 30 mins of constant stop-and-go, I can see that an auto would be more comfortable.   If you have a friend or family member that has a manual; have them teach you how to drive it, and make the decision for yourself. There are plenty of people with the auto that are happy with it. It's an entirely subjective experience."
Miata,3ctixw,insomniaticnotw,9,Fri Jul 10 20:22:10 2015 UTC,"If you're going to get the auto, don't even bother with this car. The manual is a huge part of the car and the most fun part. But you do you bro."
Miata,3ctixw,avixing,2,Fri Jul 10 18:01:27 2015 UTC,"Automatics really AREN'T that bad.  I bought a Miata for the sole purpose of being able to find one with a manual transmission EASILY, and obviously because I wanted to drive with one.  You're not disgracing the Miata community or anything by driving with one. The only legitimate downside I am going to point out is that an automatic will decrease the resale value on the car. It's should be obvious by the comments that many wouldn't even consider Miatas with automatic transmissions existing. There are very few people who'd want to buy a used Miata with an automatic unless it was particularly cheap.  Overall, I'm going to say that the gearbox is not the highlight of this car, but the suspension is. An automatic will probably let you pay more attention to it anyways. I hope you enjoy the car no matter what transmission you pick!"

Miata,3ctixw,MistaPitts,2,Fri Jul 10 17:55:13 2015 UTC,"I really want to get the manual, it just seems too much micro managing.   After about a week of driving the car, it will stop being micro managing. Get the manual. You won't notice it on the commute, and you'll thank yourself when you take it out on a windy road."

Miata,3ctixw,IAmInACubicle,1 point,Sat Jul 11 01:46:21 2015 UTC,"Alright, I see this question a lot, so let me throw out my personal issues that might sway me towards one or the other: I learned to drive on an auto.  All my friends learned to drive on an auto.  I am the only one in my family that can drive stick.  My Miata was my first stick shift, I learned to drive stick over the weekend, drove it to work every day the next week.  (Plano area, Texas represent!) I really enjoy driving, and driving hard.    I can understand why people would think the manual is ""too hard to learn"" or ""too much to bother with in traffic,"" though personally, I never had an issue.  I will never, by choice, go back to driving an automatic.  I am one of three people I know that can drive a stick, which caused some problems.  No one in my family could drive my car, only one of my friends that I ever saw regularly could drive it, so if I was hanging out late with people, I'd have to leave early more than once so that I could be awake for the drive home - no one else could drive me home if I got too tired.  And yet, still, I will always take a stick shift over an automatic until I am physically incapable of driving a stick shift.  It's just so much more versatile.  If you want to drive it for economy, go for it, shift at or below 2500.  Want to have fun on a spirited weekend/evening drive, go for it, shift at 6000.  Miata don't care.  When you get an automatic, you're restricted to shifting when it wants to.  Honestly, I found the manual to be better for my 15min/5day job.  Because I have a horrifically mind numbing cubicle job (18, part time, love the people, can't complain about having the job, but it's...dull), but it didn't matter how bad the day was, I could always enjoy the drive to and from work, and in the evening if I wanted too.     And as for learning, it's not that hard.  Just see if you can't find someone around you that can give you a few helper tips.  Otherwise I say just take the clutch reeeeaaaaalllly slow the first few times, while revving kinda high.  Buy it Saturday morning, find a parking lot, find a hill on Sunday, you'll be good to go on Monday.  Edit:  I should probably just throw a TL;DR in here: Automatics are nice - nice and docile.  If you want to drive the car like it's a Miata, I'd recommend the manual.  If you want to drive the car like it's any other car, then get the automatic, and never find out what the true potential of this beautiful chassis is."
Miata,3ctixw,Konraden,1 point,Sat Jul 11 04:39:32 2015 UTC,"I learned to drive a stick for all of about an hour--ten years ago. I used that limited knowledge to drive my current NA (which I bought a few weeks ago) with a 5-speed manual. My other car is a Mazda 3 with an automatic.   I love driving my Mazda 3. It's fun. I get all the joy of a stick shift with zero clutch. I love driving my Miata, it's fun. It's fun because I'm learning so much about driving with a stick.   My opinion? If this is going to be a regular, daily driving in traffic, and you don't particularly care about having a manual--get the automatic. It'll be easier to drive, anyone can drive it, and it's a lot less frustration, especially early on.  If you want to learn how to drive a stick (and eventually) be good at it, you can go with the stick. But honestly, these cars are not all that practical. They're toys, and you should view it that way. I think anyone seeing them as a serious functional vehicle has been huffing too much of the gas fumes.  In my experience the past few weeks, I'm significantly more distracted from the road driving my stick as it hasn't really become second nature to me yet. Over the past 19 days, I've driven my Miata 500 miles over 17 days through my typical routes. I find myself watching the tach a lot while I'm getting going between 1st, 2nd, and 3rd to make sure I'm getting it down right. I'm also not great at rev-matching and down-shifting while braking, so I find myself slowing down well in advance of lights, and being about 3x more cautious than normal. I'm distracted at lights because I have to remember to put the car in gear before stepping on the gas, which also means having to step on the clutch. I'm a little too timid on hills--so I ended up stalling or squawking tires. Etc, etc.   I don't think I'd want my Miata if I was forced to drive it every day, especially on a bad day when it's pouring rain, or when I'm exhausted, or if I had to fit more than one (short) person in my car, or any other reason that isn't because I want to drive the car that day. I'd resent having it if I had to drive it against my will. I'm lucky I have two cars so I can pick the right one for the day.  Pick the right one for you."
Miata,3ctixw,ultraberry,1 point,Sat Jul 11 06:16:39 2015 UTC,"The NC semi-auto is sweet, I prefer it over my NA manual anyday. I get all the nutty driving antics without ever taking my hands off the wheel to shift with the awesome paddle shifters."

Miata,3ctixw,brandocommando29,0,Fri Jul 10 19:45:31 2015 UTC,"You are asking for an answer to an objective question but the Miata will always lose that battle on paper. For the same money you could get a nice midsize sedan with lots of features, much more space, an auto tranny and similar (or better) mpg. All the things you'd want for a daily driver, especially if you encounter lots of traffic. But Miata is a sports car. These type of cars never ""make sense."" We drive them because they provide an emotional experience that speaks to your soul, and an automatic transmission only subtracts from that experience. I have driven all widely available transmissions (manual, auto, cvt, dual clutch) and still prefer a manual, no matter the traffic situation."
Miata,3ctqln,MistaPitts,3,Fri Jul 10 18:27:02 2015 UTC,If your engine is stock the biggest difference will bring Just the sound. It may free up a few horsepower. If you are running Forced Induction then definitely go for it for performance reasons.
Miata,3ctqln,bootymanager,3,Fri Jul 10 19:04:06 2015 UTC,"Full exhaust? Nope. Muffler, yep. I had a full header-back exhaust on my track car, sure. RB tri-y header, custom Enthuza header-back. On this car though, just an Enthuza Borla rear piece for the noise because stock sucks. $400 vs. $1k."
Miata,3ctqln,PrintError,2,Fri Jul 10 19:50:20 2015 UTC,I'd say no. Intake and muffler should give a much nicer sound than stock without being too obnoxious for the street. Plus you can put that leftover money towards suspension.
Miata,3ctqln,brandocommando29,1 point,Sat Jul 11 01:21:26 2015 UTC,"Full exhaust plus tune will give you big gains on a 2009+ NC manual, which you have.  But it will be a waste of money if you're not going to be racing it at all.  Unless you like having theoretical bragging rights."

OP, go to the Miata.net NC power mods section and poke around. You can uncork quite a bit of power if you are willing to commit to running super unleaded, getting a full tune from one of the forum sponsors, and adding headers and full exhaust. You can get over 20 horsepower and quite a bit more torque. It makes a big difference.   With that said, it really only improves the acceleration a bit but still doesn't make the car a rocketship. For that you need forced induction, or better yet an engine replacement (2.5 and FI 2.5 conversions are becoming quite popular)."

Miata,3crh7l,AceofZulu,1 point,Fri Jul 10 20:51:16 2015 UTC,Ive been putting some thought into doing this. Just a couple of questions though. How much for all the wrapping? Can it come off easily without damaging the original paint? And how hard (or easy) was it to install?
Miata,3crh7l,1RMDave,1 point,Sat Jul 11 03:19:04 2015 UTC,I'll talk in approximates - around $2000 for the wrap including the door jambs.  It will need to be removed by a professional for a few hundred dollars and won't damage original paint as long as the paint isn't too thin.  It's taking about a week to install. The fine folks at One Soul Graphics in Metro Detroit do a meticulous job taking the right amount of time to get it right.

Miata,3cr681,zeoalex,3,Fri Jul 10 14:58:10 2015 UTC,"Well there is a crowd that idolizes JDM cars and a warped sense of Japanese car styling. You'll notice I don't have any gaudy stickers or stuffed animals hanging off my bumpers...  For some people like myself, it's an unbeatable combination of value, condition of the cars and the fact that a lot of the cars simply don't exist in the USDM market. My Subaru for example is a 270 hp car that cost me less than buying a local RS trim Impreza which made 165hp. The starting price for a claped out old Subaru where I live is around $5k. I didn't pay much more than that for the STI. A LOT of people complain about drving RHD in a LHD country but 99% of the time they haven't tried driving one. Give it 2 weeks and you forget about it. There are special concerns with some manuevers like single lane passing but other things are safer."
Miata,3cr681,svetki,3,Fri Jul 10 15:07:35 2015 UTC,"re: subaru prices. for some reason, they hold their value absurdly well...a lot of it is ask vs. get, but there's a local guy asking 7k for a 2004 wrx with 181k miles.  People ask 5k for a rusty RS pretty consistently...it's just mind blowing.  I'd LOVE to have a JDM STi"
Miata,3cr681,zeoalex,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:21:06 2015 UTC,"Wow, http://jdmconnection.ca/?page_id=10&id=1580"
Miata,3cr681,svetki,2,Fri Jul 10 16:23:43 2015 UTC,"yup. exactly. I wonder if you can use the substantially similar clause to get it imported.  They had that body style in the US (just not with that engine), and brought essentially the same engine over a few years later.  it'd be REAL cool if you could pass it like that"
Miata,3cr681,Konraden,2,Fri Jul 10 16:29:10 2015 UTC,"Yep! that's probably the most common import. They are a great deal and very easy to find. Bugeye bodystyle is fair game next year I believe.  EDIT: Their local stock is lacking in the summer cause everyone buys fun cars this time of year. They regularly have twin turbo Subaru Legacy GT-Bs for >$5000 CAD. Friend bought a turbo manual Forrester for $4400 last year. The best way to do it is get access to the Japanese auction house. They move up to 100,000 cars a week and you get pics and a description for each one. I always wait and watch the auctions after dropping my deposit."

Miata,3cr681,spokkeh,1 point,Fri Jul 10 20:14:33 2015 UTC,I watched the Jalopnik thing about the R32 and he said the worst part was making a left turn from the center lane. You just kind of have to--go for it.
Miata,3cr681,Tothpick,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:11:13 2015 UTC,If traffic is light to moderate you can look around the other car turning left and wait for a pause in traffic. If it's heavy you have to wait for a late yellow to enter. But that's no diferent than if there were a large truck turning left in the opposing lane. You couldn't see properly in a LHD.
Miata,3cr681,Tothpick,2,Fri Jul 10 18:28:51 2015 UTC,"Pretty interesting car. She looks beautiful, the engine bay is clean. But I'd check that. radiator out... she's olive green. Usually no bueno."

I have driven most models of miatas and the NA is unfuckingbeatable. I have driven NA6, NA8, NB1, NC1, and NC3. I doubt the ND is anything special of course it has more horsepower than the NA6 it's trying to be and 1 pound heavier but those angry headlights and sharp corners are unattractive to me."

Going up the elevation change into the upper portion of the course was fantastic, I was sliding my '94 all over the place, pretending to be drift pro. Good fun =)"

Miata,3cok4g,UberGhast,1 point,Sat Jul 11 21:07:21 2015 UTC,"Aftermarket wheels, suspension, and exhaust. Just keep your drifting off public roads and remember that drifting is the SLOW way to get around a track, If want to win a race you shouldn't be drifting!   If you want to get a little slidey I recommend going for a 94 or newer with the torsen limited slip differential. But truth be told, mine only really drifts when its raining or snowing =]"
Miata,3cok4g,Slyons89,2,Sat Jul 11 21:26:26 2015 UTC,Yea definitely going for the LSD and also will probably do a performance exhaust mod for a bit more power and also coil overs are a must for me.   I fully understand drifting vs grip for racing.   Do u not drift your miata often because of lack of power or because you don't want to harm tires?
Miata,3cok4g,UberGhast,1 point,Sat Jul 11 21:43:48 2015 UTC,Lack of power and also because crashing is expensive and I love my car. Learning to drift can be a very... Trial and error type process. But this autocross course at lime rock park is wonderful because there's really nothing to crash into.
Miata,3cpxct,Trueno07,5,Thu Jul 9 20:50:05 2015 UTC,Tires first. They make the most noticeable difference. Then do other things like coils and sway bars.
Miata,3cpxct,effse7en,3,Thu Jul 9 23:02:01 2015 UTC,Agreed. $400 buys you a very nice set of summer tires for this car. Remainder to be used for install.

Miata,3cpxct,tjr97,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:47:58 2015 UTC,Shock* anyways i would think you should do the shocks and springs all at once since putting different springs on the OEM shocks is usually a no no   Edit: also I believe you really only need a front sway bar
Miata,3cpxct,tjr97,3,Fri Jul 10 15:56:34 2015 UTC,Ehh it's 200 for both ill stick to that. But yea I don't wanna put good springs on a shot shock but I've gotta get the roll under control until I can save up enough for something that's not race land.
Miata,3cpxct,Slyons89,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:03:46 2015 UTC,"The sway bars should do a great deal to help the body roll go bye bye, maybe buy those, see how you like it, and if it is tolerable, save up for a nice suspension set up and you'll be golden"
Miata,3cpxct,Slyons89,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:13:03 2015 UTC,Save yourself some money and just get a front sway bar. The rear one is unnecessary and gives too much oversteer IMO.

Miata,3co8ax,ItsGnar,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:56:15 2015 UTC,It may be a crime but good luck getting the police to deal with it beyond giving you a crime number.  Most places won't hand over CCTV to anyone but police. Police will not bother with a petty crime.

To avoid that issue, my best advice is to move. I've been a couple times, and purely based on the driving there, I would never move there. Not unless I had enough money to build my own, personal subway stations all throughout the city, and an underground (literally underground) race track. That'd actually be rad."

One summer a few years back, he was driving a silver 99 NB - that was the summer I'd hang around his work. I had a total blast riding in it - having the top down while listening to the radio was quite fun for me. Fast forward a few years, and since I just graduated high school my parents figured it was time for me to get my own car. So we went to auto auctions to save money - they were planning on buying something somewhat cheap and reliable. Last Thursday, there was this 2000 Miata there, with only 60,000 miles on it. Seeing the smile on my face, we bid and won the auction - after paying for it to be inspected took it home. The previous owner was kind enough to include a nice new stereo that connects to my iPod - thanks for that. Granted, it's an automatic, but I personally can't say I mind too much."

I also see by looking in your submission history that you've done up your interior in carbon fiber; was that just vinyl wrap?

They are stupid bright and I actually think they made a difference in being seen. http://i.imgur.com/pxe9s2P.jpg  The wrap has to be 3M's 1080 Scotchprint and the vents have to be primered with 3M's Primer 94.

Apparently you can do some real damage to brake pads and rotors if you run them around the track for 20 minutes, get them really, really hot, then clamp them down to cool."
Miata,3ck35d,MitchiJZA80,5,Wed Jul 8 21:08:56 2015 UTC,"The reason you don't set the e-brake after a track session is that the pads can ""weld"" to the hot rotors. I've had it happen, and I've seen evidence of it having happened when doing brake jobs on buddies' cars. The pads will usually break lose pretty quick when you start to drive, but you will feel them do so, and it damages the pads and leaves permanent marks on the rotors."

Miata,3ck35d,massDiction,3,Wed Jul 8 19:56:27 2015 UTC,"No e-brake that is functional and adjusted properly would do what you describe. In fact, exactly the opposite happens. If the e-brake is applied when the brakes are hot, the pads weld to the rotors. When you release the e-brake handle, the cable goes slack but the piston doesn't retract because the pads are stuck to the rotors.   What is far more likely is that the e-brake on this car wasn't functional to begin with, or wasn't set, and the car was not left in gear. Another possibility, given that it's a convertible with the top down, is that some dickhead came along, put the car in neutral and released the e-brake, all of which can be done without a key."
Miata,3ck35d,StayRiceForLifeBro94,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:36:47 2015 UTC,"The pad-rotor welding only happens if they're really hot, which spirited road driving won't do.  That being said, it's probably just as likely that they forgot to set it or it isn't properly set up."

Miata,3ck35d,Tissue285,-6,Wed Jul 8 17:11:38 2015 UTC,"Your engine doesn't fire and spin in reverse when you switch to that gear, it just adds another gear in between the engine and drive shaft that reverses the output direction.  Otherwise you'd obliterate your engine."
Miata,3ck35d,EntroperZero,5,Wed Jul 8 17:08:43 2015 UTC,"I didn't say it fired.  I'm talking about if your car rolls forward while in reverse, or rolls backward while in first."
Miata,3ck35d,fryfrog,-2,Wed Jul 8 17:19:25 2015 UTC,If you park facing a downhill and leave it in reverse it won't roll down... Same is true for the opposite scenario.
Miata,3ck35d,ColouringPencil,5,Wed Jul 8 17:23:54 2015 UTC,"It shouldn't roll if you park it in gear, whether you're in first or reverse, but sometimes it does anyway if it's steep enough."
Miata,3ck35d,G3ML1NGZ,3,Wed Jul 8 17:30:47 2015 UTC,"Or if someone hits you.  Honestly, I actually leave it in the gear it is safest for me to accidentally lurch in."
Miata,3ck35d,asas71,-9,Wed Jul 8 17:56:21 2015 UTC,"Whereas I advise to never leave the car in gear when parked, I always put the clutch in when I start a car, but a lot of people do not, so could try start the car in gear and it may lurch forward and hit something."
Miata,3ck35d,ColouringPencil,11,Wed Jul 8 15:56:08 2015 UTC,And those people should not drive. This is tought in all driving schools here as standard practice
Miata,3ck35d,SuperstarTinsanity,-2,Wed Jul 8 16:18:24 2015 UTC,Who are we kidding they don't teach how to drive a standard anymore and I don't think they have for more than a few years now
Miata,3ck35d,fprintf,4,Wed Jul 8 16:40:33 2015 UTC,"I'm from the UK where learning to drive a manual is the norm, and automatic transmissions are slowly becoming more common :P"
Miata,3ck35d,HyperspaceCatnip,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:36:37 2015 UTC,"What I hear from people (ie anecdotal), in the US taking the driving test in manual is basically auto (no pun intended) fail, without explanation or reasonable cause (such as stalling, gear grinding etc)."
Miata,3ck35d,G3ML1NGZ,6,Wed Jul 8 17:50:16 2015 UTC,Not true. Both of my kids have recently passed their driving tests here in the U.S. driving a manual Mini Cooper S.   Your friends don't know what they are talking about.
Miata,3ck35d,ColouringPencil,2,Wed Jul 8 18:00:57 2015 UTC,"I did my US driving test in a manual 2001 Mustang in 2011. I actually said to the examiner ""So, do you want me to do the UK style of driving manual?"" and she just said ""Sure, do whatever you like"". 5 minutes later I passed (seriously, I was surprised at how little I had to do for the test compared to the UK one, which involved parallel parking, reversing round corners and that ""emergency stop"" thing)"
Miata,3ck35d,G3ML1NGZ,2,Wed Jul 8 18:39:56 2015 UTC,Yeah. My view might be skewed. I live in Iceland where all drivers education is on manuals and manual transmissions are vastly more common in cars

Miata,3ck35d,miatainkansas,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:47:54 2015 UTC,You are being the lazy one if you leave it out of gear just so you don't forget to take it out of gear when you turn the car on...
Miata,3ck35d,G3ML1NGZ,-2,Wed Jul 8 17:24:54 2015 UTC,I fail to see how this makes me lazy. What if you let someone else drive your car that doesn't instinctively put the clutch in when they go to start it up? What if you forget to put the clutch in when you start the car as you're doing something else like talking to your passenger? Just because I don't do what you do does not make me lazy genius.
Miata,3ck35d,miatainkansas,-3,Wed Jul 8 17:40:10 2015 UTC,"No, but it does make you incredibly dumb.   That parking brake will fail one day, and your car will go roll into someone or something."

Miata,3ck35d,ColouringPencil,-1,Wed Jul 8 17:55:07 2015 UTC,"I've never heard of any of the above happening, I just assume you only know of stupid cunts that can't maintain their car properly. Initially I was just making a point as it's something other people do, but you went on to be a gaping grade A cunt about it because of things that have happened to you and your evidently incompetent associates!"
Miata,3ck35d,miatainkansas,-1,Wed Jul 8 18:04:52 2015 UTC,You must live some place with a lot of hills. You also must be in a place that irritates you because you seem very unnecessarily angry about this topic.
Miata,3ck35d,sian92,-1,Wed Jul 8 18:36:24 2015 UTC,"I don't know of anyone who's handbrake has ever failed. I do this thing called basic maintenance, and in the UK we have this thing called an MOT, which tests all safety aspects of your car, including the condition of, and strength of, your handbrake. If it does not meet the standard your car is failed and is deemed unsafe and illegal to use on the public road. Where I live there are no hills and it is completely flat, so even if for some reason the handbrake cable decided to snap, the car would not go anywhere."
Miata,3ck35d,ColouringPencil,-2,Wed Jul 8 18:00:46 2015 UTC,"So basically you admit you are counting on flat ground and the parking brake to remain functional all the way from inspection to inspection, assuming the guy who tests it even does the test properly, to keep your car from becoming a legal liability?  You could just leave it in gear, then it wouldn't roll unless the clutch failed AND the parking brake failed, but I guess just trusting one tiny ass 25+ year old rusty e-brake cable is the right thing to do, because you and your associates are really fucking stupid.   I thought Europeans were supposed to be smart and good driving manual cars, guess you aren't one of them."
Miata,3ck35d,agloeRegrets,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:21:54 2015 UTC,"Clutches fail engaged. A clutch failure in gear would prevent you from shifting, but not allow the car to roll. You would need to have all four [sets of] piston rings fail for that to happen."
Miata,3ck35d,HyperspaceCatnip,0,Thu Jul 9 18:45:03 2015 UTC,"Yes I trust the guy testing it, as the test is not just done by any random person, you have to be registered and license to test a car. As I said, the cable is tested for condition and effectiveness, and if it is not good enough then the car is failed and it is REPLACED. This means that the old part is taken out, and a new one put in its place, or is this concept too difficult to grasp for you?"
Miata,3ck35d,dr2fish,4,Wed Jul 8 18:26:50 2015 UTC,"While I would normally not agree, the Miata uses an ignition interrupt switch on the pedal instead of on the slave. This means that a clutch hydraulics failure while the car is in 1st gear will allow the crank to drive the transmission and thus the rear wheels during startup and possible injury. Leave the car parked in first, Start in neutral.   Source: Own experience in a garage. Apparently the miata is capable of becoming an electric car with the motor."

Someone was coming up behind the Honda SUV, and instead of stopping, they swerved around them and hit me while turning. It was deemed partially at fault because technically they had the right of way, but the speed limit there is 25 and they spun my car around, police said he was probably doing 45-55. Also right out of frame is a stoplight that was red at the time (Which the other guy was heading for) so I have no idea why he was going so fast, unless he was going to run it.  I walked away without a scratch, airbags didn't go off, he went to the hospital because his airbag smacked him in the face. No collision, so I basically paid to rent the car for a week. Thing was in shit condition before though, and would've been a pain to sort it all out. But I was impatient and wanted a Miata ASAP so I got the first one I found"

Miata,3cls89,keat0n,2,Wed Jul 8 22:14:33 2015 UTC,"How much smoke are we talking? Like plumes or what? I wouldn't think the oil could get that far back by just spilling onto the heatshield and being wiped up.  But i suppose anything is possible and a small amount of smoke wouldnt be too crazy from it, but it should burn off pretty quickly, i would think within 30minutes of driving it would mostly be gone on the exhaust.  Did it smoke before? There shouldn't be a burning smell ever really even if its a bit low on oil...so that's a bit odd.  You're sure its oil leaking out of the cat? You could get under the car to see where the oil is coming from.  What color is the smoke?   As far as head gasket... Does the car overheat or anything?  Does the oil on the dipstick look OK?  How about the coolant, still clean looking? (Check when cold obvs).   Could be transmission slinging fluid...I would try to get it up on jacks or ramps and crawl under to check out where its really coming from.  Also if its always been burning oil and you never noticed it could need valve stem seals.  Hopefully someone else chimes in with better ideas, I just sold my Miata last week so I don't know what I'm talking about anymore!"

Miata,3clzl5,gnoettgen,1 point,Wed Jul 8 23:11:56 2015 UTC,"Burning oil could be as easy as the CAS O-Ring. Check by running your finger around the CAS sensor and checking for oil.  Mine peed oil everywhere until I replaced it. Took ten minutes.   While you're doing the timing (cam?) belt, do the camshaft seals, crankshaft seal and valve cover seal.   While doing the clutch, might as well do the rear main.   So while doing all your other stuff, you will have the opportunity to solve your oil issues.  A shift turret rebuild is super easy, relatively cheap, and restores shifter feel.  New tops are doable with a partner and that saves money on installation.   Really, its perfectly salvageable for not a ton of cash. Its dead simple to work on, so the car knowledge your Dad has will come in handy.  The killer will be if there is rust and how good you want the body work to be. Body work murders man hours."

Miata,3clhfz,azza10,1 point,Fri Jul 10 14:28:10 2015 UTC,Makes an awful buzzing noise while engine braking in any gear.  Also has ghost gears. We think it has a bad clutch slave because it shifts perfectly while dailying but you will miss gears or grind when shifting quickly. Also it will go halfway into a gear. Look completely engaged but then you let the clutch out and nothing happens. Gotta take it out of gear and put it back in lol.
Miata,3clhfz,Slyons89,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:36:47 2015 UTC,Sounds like bad syncros and worn shifter bushing imo
Miata,3clhfz,SilverManGold,1 point,Sat Jul 11 09:15:09 2015 UTC,"The right rear corner of mine squeaks over little bumps and ruts at low speeds. Loudly. It sounds like a sick bird or something. I'm not sure if it's a bushing or the old-ass KYB agx shocks, but it couldn't be good.  The radio on AM plays feedback loudly at the RPM of the engine, so you can rev the buzzing sound up and down. It's fun for a few minutes.  Only one door lock works, and the only key I have, given to me when I bought the thing for $2k, is the valet key. That does not lock or unlock the glovebox, console, and trunk.  The tachometer sticks, often, but only momentarily. For example, staying in one gear from 30 mph to 60, it will go up to 4000 rpm on the way there, stick, then a few seconds later jump to 5500+ when I hit 60"

Miata,3coq9v,Shinny1337,8,Mon Jul 13 01:04:45 2015 UTC,Times have changed.  Drifting is the universal term for over steer all over the world. It almost every if not all Motorsports. It time to get with the times.
Miata,3coq9v,juddvong,4,Fri Jul 10 00:11:21 2015 UTC,Technically if you want to be anal about it drifting is causally/slowly going off course.  But words evolve.
Miata,3coq9v,lazyguyoncouch,3,Fri Jul 10 04:57:00 2015 UTC,"Well I come from the new school and I have grown up to know your definition of drifting as power sliding. Example here for your enjoyment just watch the first thirteen seconds https://youtu.be/4h1h1cO4BV8 ...... Side note all together I agree oversteer and drifting are different. Oversteer is an asshole that's fixable with new stronger swaybars and driving experience. Now if your rant is aimed at FWD cars that is still drifting. Drifting is having the back end of a car swung out and you direct the car using the front tires and you maintain this ""drifting"" by adding and subtracting acceleration... Another example here is the definition of drifting.   drifting: How to aim one's car at a wall and miss it completely; drifting is the opposite of grip driving, which involves taking a corner without sliding. This can be done without any regard to horsepower, weight, or any other factors. Essentially this means any car can drift, however,[some cars are more apt to powerslide than drift].  {this part is most applicable to your defintion of drifting} Drifting originated in Japan, thus most cars used to drift are Japanese. Most of the cars used to drift are also usually RWD cars with FR layouts, as they are easier to drift than AWD cars, FWD cars, or RWD cars with MR layouts.  That's that old timer class is dismissed."
Miata,3coq9v,StayRiceForLifeBro94,1 point,Fri Jul 10 00:11:11 2015 UTC,Since when did the term for drifting become co-opted to mean sliding the rear end?   Since day 1. IIRC didn't Keiichi Tsuchiya say he started doing deliberate oversteer and things when he was out of the running on various touge type things and the crowd went nuts even though he was last?   m pretty old school and when I was learning to drive the pinnacle of car control was the four-wheel drift   Maybe in Rallying but in most motorsports you want to do the opposite so as not to mangle your tires.

Miata,3ck9g4,Ryzu,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:32:27 2015 UTC,"I came here to say just this.  Depending on where OP lives, rust may be the factor that limits the life of the car.  I sold a NB with 140,000 miles on it (still ran great, didn't burn oil) because the rockers were rusting through."

They're somewhat shallow, so the seatbelt works just fine. They won't fit much larger than a 35"" waist, so unfortunately fat bottomed girls must get on their bikes and ride.

Miata,3cfrlr,PartIy_CIoudy,2,Tue Jul 7 19:44:38 2015 UTC,"Here is a tip, drill the holes in your lip extra large (i think mine are about 1 cm in diameter) and use big washers when mounting the lip. This way, if you drill the holes in your bumper slightly off, it gives you some wiggle room so you can still get the lip flush and exactly where you want it by sliding the lip around in the holes. Idk if this makes sense, I'd post a picture of it if my car was with me."

Miata,3ck8b5,bootymanager,2,Wed Jul 8 15:43:15 2015 UTC,"Sounds like your alternator is going out. If it goes off at higher rpms, it means your engine is turning fast enough to generate the charge necessary. When you're idling, its turning slower and is probably worn out, thus not making enough electricity."

The way I knew, was my charging light was like yours and would work intermittently AND I kept getting this burnt rubber smelling smoke from under the hood. So I took my alternator off and got it checked(at a couple different places because I swear no one ever calibrates those machines) and everyone said it was fine, and I started looking at it and my alternator pulley had burnt black rubber from the belt all over(it never squealed). Cleaned it off, got a new belt, and it works great now. Although it could also just be the belt need's to be tightened or worst case the alternator is just going out."

Miata,3cgll7,flegory,2,Tue Jul 7 19:50:05 2015 UTC,"My wife and I took a camping trip to Yosemite last week. I like to have a big luxurious 6 person mountain hardware tent. She likes to have big comfortable camp chairs. I can attach that stuff to a rack from good-win racing, The trunk can hold some backpacking cots, clothes, other backpacking style equipment and a small cooler with  beer, meat, cheese, and a melon. Behind the seats, I pack our sleeping bags, pillows, and dry food.  This was the most loaded down she ever was. I was worried, but she climbed the hills with ease. Some of the scenic overlooks had gravel drive offs that required some careful navigation, and our campsite was too rutted to back into effectively. Otherwise the roads in and around Yosemite are in great condition. Driving around the park and through the valley with the top down was amazing.   Honestly, if you drive through Yosemite valley in a car with a roof, you are really missing out.  edit: I wanted to add that we live in Oakland, CA. this wasn't a huge cross country road trip, just a 3 hour drive. a great 3 hour drive."

But the top folds down in a way that removes that space. I know the first two models still had some usable shelf back there even with the top down. Looks like you got one of the good classic carriers racks. that's what i wanted, but the company seems to have gone under :/  That shelter on the top of the mountain looks familiar. Is that on the AT in shenandoah? i went there a bunch when i lived in DC (didn't have a miata then, camping was easy in my xterra)"
Miata,3cgll7,Electric_Rectum,2,Fri Jul 10 03:03:58 2015 UTC,A lot of those shelters tend to look the same on the AT. It's actually up in Stokes State forest in NJ. That one I believe is just south of Sunrise Mountain. My luggage rack is the same style as the Classic Carrier one but it's a different company and was under $200 shipped.  Raceland USA is where I got that from. Works perfect for a full sized suitcase and then I can just load that up however I want. I've wrapped it in my tent's rainfly for protection from the rain.

Miata,3chfdn,Creativeusername833,2,Wed Jul 8 20:02:24 2015 UTC,Insurance companies will typically dish out an indemnity on your car that is a fair bit above fair market value. They do this so that you will take the money and not protest the quote - consuming more of their time. They want you to take the check and go away.   What will typically happen is that they will make you an offer much better than you would have gotten if you were to sell the car privately. I got $2560 from my '93 NA that was probably worth no more than $1500.

Miata,3chzj1,KnuckleBuster626,2,Wed Jul 8 02:01:15 2015 UTC,According to my VIN its a short nose crank. Because of this what would you recommend I do. I would really like this to last but I bought it to beat it up.  ALSO Pictures have been added! What do you think?
Miata,3chzj1,KnuckleBuster626,1 point,Wed Jul 8 02:11:32 2015 UTC,"I would personally just beat it up. Even with 160k on the clock, if the compression is still good the motor itself will last (unless you go F.I. with poor tune.) The limiting factor is going to be how long the timing belt will last or the front crank seal. Its when either of those need to be replaced is when you have to have the front crank pulley removed and that is when the problem can possibly occur. But at this time, just drive the snot out of it. I had a 1.8L with nearly as many miles and I tracked the crap out of it and it took it like a champ."
Miata,3chzj1,StayRiceForLifeBro94,-1,Wed Jul 8 13:51:19 2015 UTC,My advice don't worry about it for now. Just save up for a swap because some short noses had issues that caused failure of the engine. So for now enjoy and just keep putting money away and swap in a new motor when your finances allow you to do so comfortably.
Miata,3chzj1,stahlgrau,1 point,Wed Jul 8 02:32:00 2015 UTC,How much does a new motor run about? 2k with install?

Hey question by the way do you happen to go to the krispy kreme donut meet on Fridays in punte hills? I ask this because I'm certain you read my comment about myself joining the club soon. My knowledge on miatas is fresh all other cars I'm more experianced with I just try to help out where ever I can. I just met the event leader at seven eleven today in brea he said his name was John he owned a mazdaspeed looked like a 2003 in bugandy with a black hardtop. It'd be awesome to meet a fellow redditor and miata owner.   Edit: if you are John in some weird ass coincidence well hello again sir I was the idiot in the green car who made a joke about enjoying your hair dryers.
Miata,3chzj1,dr2fish,0,Wed Jul 8 05:41:10 2015 UTC,"It depends on where you go. You can go to used engine sites that will sell you a FULLY rebuilt AND tested engine for your car that runs about $1300 and an install at a local a shop about $1500-$2000 or at a junkyard if you pull the engine yourself off a 1992-1993 (that's when they fixed the crankshaft problem) about $300-$650 depending on the mileage the install stays the same price... Now here's the thing they fail yes but, they might not. So there's an idea don't worry about it and save up for a swap JUST in case it happens which it might not... I know your pain man I'm lining up to buy a short nose as well http://www.lahabraautosales.net/sites/mobile/mo_iLD.php?used_car=1991-Mazda-MX-5_Miata-&iid=1392935517&siteID=ho73e54c0spugwr ... So I know what you are thinking. You are like oh shit I bought a car that came from the factory with an engine problem oh fuck what do I do? You do nothing and enjoy and save up man for the possibility.   Edit: funny thing is that they fixed the crank shaft problem in 1991 and a half. Only 200 more cars made after mine had the problem. So that means that the 201st car didn't have this problem anymore how lucky am I? Haha yet I'm okay with it. When I can afford to I'll swap a 1.8 off a mazdaspeed and put a turbo on it then my car will be my dream. Headlights go up and down and blow off makes noise and tire smoke for days."
Miata,3chzj1,stahlgrau,3,Wed Jul 8 03:40:26 2015 UTC,"Man, I dunno where you all live that $2900 is high for a clean 1.6 - I searched for months for one less than $4k and finally gave up looking.  I agree that the mods are...distasteful...but they should be easily reversed and you might break even by selling them.  As long as it's not rusty I think you got an excellent deal.

Miata,3cj3rz,codec303,2,Wed Jul 8 08:43:00 2015 UTC,"Brake/clutch hydraulic fluids are hygroscopic, which means it absorbs water from the atmosphere. This water can mix with the fluids in the lines allowing rust to form.  On the other hand, braking applications produce heat so the fluid used must have both a high boiling point to remain effective and a low freezing point so as not to freeze or thicken in cold conditions.  For this very reason, it's important to replace these fluids as per mfr's schedule.  The small black bits you mentioned are the 2nd sign that the cylinder cups have worn down and you should consider that leaks will soon develop; the 1st sign is discoloration of the fluids, which you have mentioned too.  You did the right thing by flushing it out; it gives you the opportunity to check for fluid loss, leaks and the bleeding of the lines.  Next consider the costs of replacement parts and labor costs vs. doing it yourself, if you are capable. It would be easy to have those parts on hand, but as I had already stated, the fluid is hygroscopic and rust will eventually develop in parts that just lay around.  Flush again at the next oil change and see what comes out..."

Brake fluid is cheap and easy to change, while replacement brake parts are not cheap and far less easy to change. :) I'll keep an eye out for a spare master cylinder, as I think I'm capable of a simple swap in case anything bad does happen, whereas MC disassembley and seal swapping is beyond my skillset."

Miata,3cfjvn,IAmInACubicle,9,Tue Jul 7 14:57:59 2015 UTC,"Miatas are cheaper to maintain and upgrade, have a superior suspension layout (double a arm all around), and are modern enough that you don't have to worry about most typical old car problems."
Miata,3cfjvn,ToughenedTitties,7,Tue Jul 7 16:54:26 2015 UTC,Just go with the one your heart is set on. They both are great cars and both have positives and negatives. I don't think you will be dissatisfied with either. Both are easy to work on and both are raced predominantly more then other cars for a reason. I do not believe one is better then the other. You just need to make up your own mind.
Miata,3cfjvn,Zenie,5,Tue Jul 7 15:08:55 2015 UTC,"The thing is I'm not really set on any of them.  I used to have a Miata, so I have a lean towards that, but I like the look of the E30 as well as the idea of just something different.  Here in the DFW area (Texas), Miata's are a lot easier to find than E30's, so it's kinda the easy option.  I'm honestly mostly interested in figuring out which one performs better for my usage (corners), and basing it off that mainly, and then coming down to looks."
Miata,3cfjvn,Zenie,6,Tue Jul 7 15:31:01 2015 UTC,I'm biased... But I think the community is better behind miatas and I think the part availability is better. Consumables are cheaper too and I also think miatas are a little more simple then the BMW so it's more reliable and easier to work on when your learning.
Miata,3cfjvn,Sir_not_sir,3,Tue Jul 7 15:36:56 2015 UTC,"I haven't noticed a whole lot of difference between the communities imho, both have tuners/ricers/crazy engine swaps/""keep it stock or you are hellspawn"" parties.

Miata,3cfjvn,eman88,3,Tue Jul 7 15:58:24 2015 UTC,I'll be moving to Dallas in a few weeks. Any other good driving road suggestions?
Miata,3cfjvn,asas71,5,Tue Jul 7 17:59:07 2015 UTC,"Honestly, there's nothing really fun in Dallas except the Reunion Tower.  It's just all business stuff and hobos (I wish I was joking about this). Fort Worth is where all the fun stuff is as far as cities go.   For fun roads, as far as I am aware, you gotta drive north.  Take Dallas North Tollway north until it ends at 380, but don't go on 380, just keep going, and it dissolves into backroads and farmroads, this is where I normally drive due to it being close to me. FM455 (accessible by 35 or 380) and that area up past Denton towards Forestburg and all those are great, a lot of the corners there are sharper than they look with a notable lack of guard rails, so do be careful (one up there is known as Dead Man's Curve, people go off it often enough). Pretty much just get away from the city and into the farm and backroads, stuff stops being straight lines.  As for roads to avoid...pretty much anything is bad during rush hour.  Texans are great people.  If you're not from Texas, they'll make you a Texan.  But you put them in a car and they all turn into New Yorkers (the fact that my Miata had a very loud exhaust and a 7,200rpm rev limiter was the only thing keeping me from being hit more than once). 35, 75, and Dallas North Tollway are pretty rough, and you better be a praying/religious person (if you aren't you will be) if you want to take a lowered car on 35 or 75 due to construction.  121 usually isn't too bad on traffic and it's a pretty smooth road, but same as anything it gets blocked up during rush hour.  Most the roads are fine on traffic during the day.  Those are the only roads I've really been on, there's a Metroplex Miata facebook group, I'm sure you can find more suggestions there.  Good luck, and welcome to Texas!  Have fun with the A/C bill."

Though I gotta say - I had an NB Miata ('00, so it didn't even have the good lights), and I loved that thing to death (I can honestly getting rid of it was the second worst decision I've made in close to 5 years, which is nearly a third of my life).  From what I've been reading, I don't think you'll go wrong with either.  Read the comments, ask the people, and good luck!  Maybe I'll see you around soon. :D"
Miata,3cfjvn,dr2fish,2,Tue Jul 7 19:56:41 2015 UTC,"Parts are going to be a lot cheaper for the Miata, and for $4,000 you're more likely to find a clean NA than you are a clean E30. I went through this same thing about a year ago.  If you want a wild card (I mean a REAL wild card) you can find some solid running Porsche 944's in that price range as well. Parts are going to be expensive (like the E30) but if you're talking looks... well...  A Miata is cute, lightweight and fun. An E30 is understated and handsome. But a 944 looks like a fucking racecar, and if you're anything like me, sitting in one should make you giddy.  Edit: Here you go!"
Miata,3cfjvn,dr2fish,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:17:08 2015 UTC,"Eh...there's just something about the Porsche that I don't care for in the looks...can't put my finger on it though.  Decided to go e30. Leaving post up for others questioning,  but thanks for the insight!"

Miata,3cfjvn,dr2fish,4,Thu Jul 9 23:51:05 2015 UTC,"Well, Miatas were designed to corner so I'm betting you won't be disappointed with one. I have an NA6 and it's a blast, engine is happy to rev, fast enough for me, and handling is great and direct. Very inexpensive, easy to work on, parts are plentiful and cheap, and the forums are helpful and responsive. I prefer the NAs. I don't think it matter much between the 1.6 and 1.8L motors, but if you have a 90-mid 91 you may have SNC issues but I think they are overblown. Buy the best specimen you can find. They can come loaded with AC, PS, cruise, power windows so you can have all the comforts you want. If you aren't a convertible fan, hard tops are common. 92+ has wiring for a rear defroster. For $4k I suspect you can find one around 100k miles, decent maintenance and with good paint/body/soft top. May have to buy tires or do other maintenance like coolant and hoses, rad, gear and diff oil change, or TB/WP at that price level. But $4k should buy you a solid daily. Find an unmodified one. Miatas are fun to throw around, reliable, and cheap. What's not to love?"
Miata,3cfjvn,Noster420,2,Tue Jul 7 15:39:37 2015 UTC,"I've heard all these about the miata (and experienced them all with mine), but I've heard them about the E30 as well, which is where I get thrown for a loop as to which is actually better.  What are the SNC issues?  Well, what's the SNC for that matter?  May be looking at a '90 tonight.  Comforts aren't that big of a deal, except for AC (because Texas). I am a convertible fan, and if I get a Miata I'll be keeping the softie, but I doubt I'd miss much with the E30's roof either. I can actually find solid miatas for under $4k, surprisingly.  They're pretty common here.  Modded/unmodded not too important, since I plan on doing some mods anyways.    There's nothing to not love about the Miatas that I've ever found - but I don't know of anything not to love in the E30's as well, so I'm trying to find something in one to love more than the other."
Miata,3cfjvn,Noster420,3,Tue Jul 7 16:08:56 2015 UTC,"SNC is small nose crank. It affects 90-early 91 engines. Long story short, the factory did not adequately torque the crank pulley and it can cause damage to the crank when it loosens and wears. Check out the Miata.net garage article. It's repairable if you catch it early. You can visibly check for wear by looking for the crank pulley wobbling at idle. Not all SNC engines have this issue. Other than that, they seem very reliable and fixes are well documented on Miata.net forums.   I think if you're a fan of either car, buy the best condition one of either you can find. Miatas are more common and more frequently single owner/unmodified from what I can see. You might also want to check out a Toyota MR2. Mid engined, rear wheel drive, 2 seater. Also reliable but the boosted ones are more temperamental. First gen is from 1985-1989 and have an NA 4AGE and 88-89 offered a supercharged 4AGZE motor. Both are 1.6L I4. The second gen from 1991-1995 have a 2.2L I4 (Camry motor, super common and reliable) and a 2.0L I4 turbo 3SGTE. The second gems seem to be bought up by boy racers and trashed. First gens are rusty and tired usually.i had an 88 SC before my Miata and I loved it, would love to go back to one but they are hard to find. They are rev happy like Miatas but offer hardtop, sunroof, or t tops. They are mid engines so they handle like a go kart but have more body roll than the Miata, stock for stock. There's also the 3rd gen with the 1zz 1.8L I4 that can out handle a Miata stock for stock but is much less practical. It's a convertible though.   Wow, that got long. Sorry, I was/am a big MR2 fan."
Miata,3cfjvn,OJSamson,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:56:01 2015 UTC,"I've looked into the MR2's before, and I do like them, but the aftermarket/community just doesn't seem to be there the on near the same level as the Miata/E30.  And personally, I'm not a huge fan of the looks...  Thanks for the issue on the SNC, I'll look into that.  The Miata I used to have was an NB, so I know about those more than the NA's."
Miata,3cfjvn,trippinpotato,2,Tue Jul 7 17:04:37 2015 UTC,"Agree on both point but not the looks :P something about the first gen is totally 80s. The second gens are sleek and sexy.   As for the early NAs, nothing really you need to look for other than SNC wobble, oil leak out the top back of the block (CAS o ring), rust, and leaky tops. The rest is just normal car stuff."

I've loved my 92 B&T for the last month and a half I've had it. Driven it every day it hasn't threatened to rain and it is a joy. Never been in an E30, though, but I know they are also a platform with a following."
Miata,3cfjvn,Mx5lower,4,Tue Jul 7 17:33:22 2015 UTC,"I've had two e30s (an '87 325is and a '90 325iX) and two Miatas, a '97 and my current '01, and I have extensive seat time in my dad's '90 Miata (as well as having owned a bunch of other 80's and 90's BMWs).  So, I guess I should chime in, although I'm a little late to the party.    Personally, I think the BMWs tend to have better steering and braking feel than the Miatas.  All the Miatas I've driven, including my NB, have vague midcorner steering feel, and I haven't been impressed with the brakes on the NAs I've driven (though the bigger sport brakes on my NB are lovely).  I do love the droptop, and I love the feel of the Miata, but if someone came up to me and offered me an even swap for a well-kept 'is (325 or 318) I would be extremely tempted.  They're just fantastic cars.  That said, e30s are getting harder and harder to find in nice shape; remember that the newest e30 is only one year newer than the oldest Miata.  Their prices are climbing as they get scarcer, particularly ones with the sport package, and rust can definitely be an issue.  Maintenance will be more expensive and arguably more difficult, though I'd say that's pretty much a wash.  Don't get suckered into an early 318i (non DOHC) or a 325e, or you'll hate your life (unless you are keen on a doing a Super Eta build).    I would probably suggest a 318is as the ultimate affordable e30 if you're not into straight-line power; it loses a little weight up front compared to the I6 engine (which, incidentally, was one of the few BMW engines to have a timing belt, and I believe it is interference) and IIRC tips the scales around 2600 lbs.  Your market's a lot friendlier than mine if you can find one of those in the $4k range, though.  Good luck and don't hesitate to ask if I can lend more perspective."
Miata,3cfjvn,murica_ftw,2,Tue Jul 7 17:27:03 2015 UTC,"What's the differences between the I, IS, and IX? What's wrong with the E or ES (what's the difference?)."
Miata,3cfjvn,MightyPenguin,1 point,Tue Jul 7 17:38:16 2015 UTC,"The ""i"" engines are the hotter performers (it originally stood for ""injected,"" but that kind of lost its meaning once carbs got phased out).  The '25i (m20) engines have somewhere in the realm of 167 hp and like to rev toward redline at ~6500, and the '18i engine (m42) is a sweet little chain-driven DOHC 4 with something like 138 hp.  The ""e"" engines were designed for fuel economy and lower-end torque, and max out around 5500 rpm with lower hp numbers.    The ""s"" models are the sport packages that included suspension, Recaro-like seats, and sweet aero mods.  You mention the ""es"" - it has all the suspension bits but the lump engine.  The iX was awd - it's a really cool car with a neat viscous clutch system, but the parts are unique and hard to come by, and the center diff on most of these is likely blown by now."
Miata,3cfjvn,murica_ftw,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:19:31 2015 UTC,"If you can find a good condition IX at a reasonable price (what is a reasonable price?) is the AWD worth it?  If I plan on changing the suspension and such anyways, do I need to worry about the 'is', or is an 'i' just going to be the same when I finish changing parts?  How do you tell the difference between M20 and M42, is it visible, or dependent on the years?"
Miata,3cfjvn,MightyPenguin,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:26:34 2015 UTC,"I think I saw elsewhere that you're in TX, so I wouldn't bother with an iX unless you like weird cars.  I enjoyed mine for what it was, and it was a beast in the snow, but it's slower than the RWD, loses some of the handling, and is harder to maintain.  If you get serious about one be sure to look into how to test the viscous coupling in the center diff - it's probably shot, which means that the limited slip-type power distribution won't work properly, though I never noticed it being an issue in the real world.  You don't really need to worry about the 's' bits unless you like the aero, though if I were you I would be cautious about chucking BMW's suspension.  I've ridden in my fair share of cars that have had their character ruined by crappy coilovers.  Of course, by now the struts on any of these will be due for replacement.  I think the springs are stiffer on the 'is, but I've been out of that game so long I'm not entirely sure anymore.    One note of clarification - I'm pretty sure all of the newer ('90-'91) 318 coupes are iS's, but you could get a 318i sedan with the same engine.  I didn't mean to be confusing with the engine codes - all 325i/is's have the m20 6-cylinder, and all the post-'89 318s have the m42 4-cylinder."
Miata,3cfjvn,tony_rama,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:37:59 2015 UTC,"Alright, cool.  I know that some people enjoy AWD for their grip and putting power down on all 4 wheels, didn't know if it was worth it.  I won't bother looking for one, though if one pops up I may consider it.  I am very far from ""hipster"" though the idea of something a bit different and quirky is interesting to me. I don't plan on coilovers (don't have the money for good ones, don't want to waste money on cheap ones).  Plan was to put on Bilstien shocks and struts and H&R/Eibach springs for improved stiffness/handling.  I'm not too worried about the aero.   On another note, a '96 328IS popped up for $2500 - because it's got 276k on the odometer.  Got me thinking, how many miles is too many miles?  I know that both BMW's (E30's and the above) and Miatas are generally considered extremely durable and long lasting when they're kept up with, but is there a limit (and is the above car worth consideration)?"
Miata,3cfjvn,IAmSchwasted,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:46:39 2015 UTC,"Very cool, sounds like you have a good head on your shoulders when it comes to suspension, especially if you get a non sport-package (you might find the sport springs just fine).  Good question about mileage, and you're right, it all depends on maintenance.  My stepmother has a '98 M3 with 200k, and I wouldn't hesitate to drive it anywhere.  That said, there are lots and lots of parts that get a lot of wear when a car's been driven that long (even more parts when you're looking at an e36), so it really depends if the owner was fanatical about maintenance.  Unless he's been absolutely on top of everything, that car is going to have a lot of needs really soon.    We could have a separate discussion about e36s (at last count we've had 5 of them in the family...), but you should know that they're probably at the bottom of their depreciation curve, so you're likely to find more than a few in the sub-$5k range. To most folks they're not the classics that e30s are, and they're not as modern as the e46s that followed (which I never personally warmed to), so they're kind of the red-headed stepchildren of the 3-series family.  Heck, you might even find a decent e36 M3 in the $6k range that would leave any Miata or e30 in the dust."

How do the E36's compare to the E30/Miata? What should I look for? Cheapest M3 I could find here is in the $7k range, most are in the $10k plus. :(   Yeah, the Miata I had was sitting on Emusa coilovers (budget) and while they were good, I've heard way too many things about cheap coilovers, and figure I can get much better bang for my buck out of a shock/spring combo."
Miata,3cfjvn,EkkuZakku,1 point,Tue Jul 7 19:09:24 2015 UTC,"Did he own it, or is he just selling it for someone?  If he personally owned and maintained it, and has records, it could be interesting.  At the very least you could go take it for a drive and see what a (high-mileage) e36 feels like.  e36s are undoubtedly better cars than e30s, but they lose some of the purity and character and are yet one step further removed from the purity/simplicity of a Miata.  I do think e36s have the best steering feel of any cars I've driven, but there's just something in the character of the e30 that is really timeless and joyful (in a Miata-type way, actually).  I'd probably opt for an e30 325is/318is over any e36 save an M3."

Miata,3ci5nz,projectd88,2,Wed Jul 8 02:27:32 2015 UTC,I wouldn't trust them in anything but a trailered show car. Don't skimp on safety if you plan to drive the car on track or street.
Miata,3ci5nz,Gingervitis526,1 point,Wed Jul 8 03:06:33 2015 UTC,"Why are they not as good though, I mean they have to be safer then the stock seats. I'm either sticking with stock or getting a cheap alternative."
Miata,3ci5nz,Gingervitis526,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:11:07 2015 UTC,They're so cheap because they probably have been crash tested and had little R&D. A real seat will have been crash tested until a design is found that won't break in half in a crash. OEM seats are tested extensively to make sure they are safe. I'd either only go OEM or find one that is FIA certified.
Miata,3cgnnx,twoflags,3,Tue Jul 7 19:35:52 2015 UTC,"I bought a new Miata and found to my dismay that they warranty is near worthless. Any issues are simply pushed back by the dealership (and Mazda) as not a warranty issue. Surface starts wearing out on the drivers seat at less than 3k miles - refused with, yeah the seat is defective but we will just have to replace it again if the issue reoccurs so we aren't going to do it. Smaller issues such as doors rattling when you go over a bump or the PRHT making clunking noises are handled by rolling it into the bay, waiting 15 minutes while working on other vehicles then rolling it back out with no issues found. Two years of ""free"" maintenance turned into two oil changes. I would personally never buy another new Mazda, especially with the goal of maintaining some level of factory warranty.  You would probably be far better off taking the car to a trusted mechanic and having a thorough inspection performed prior to purchase then banking the money you would have otherwise spent toward future unexpected repairs. If you have AAA, they used to offer this service as part of their membership, I haven't needed it in a number of years so I cannot speak as to its availability today."
Miata,3cgnnx,mdmcgee,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:55:52 2015 UTC,Thanks for your input. Sorry to hear that your experience with the Mazda warranty has been so poor.  Something for me to definitely think about.

Miata,3chmxd,superduck500,2,Tue Jul 7 23:52:44 2015 UTC,"This depends on state. In California, for example, it is against state law to put an older motor in a newer car (i.e. it's legal for me to put a 97 motor in my 1990 car, but I could not put my 1990 motor into a 97 car)."
Miata,3chmxd,schnurble,1 point,Wed Jul 8 01:24:21 2015 UTC,"It should work, but depending on the state you might not get a shop to do it due to emissions. If you can do it yourself (or find a shop that doesn't care) you shouldn't have any issues passing inspection.  $900 + shipping isn't bad for a need it now engine, but if you're able to wait they tend to turn up for a bit less.

On the other hand, if you're going for POWA then you might just stick with the simpler NA motor and slap a turbo on there."

Miata,3chmxd,aidandj,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:35:03 2015 UTC,"You never said what was wrong with your current motor. Rebuilding can quickly snowball price wise (do you want to bore the block? That's new pistons + rings, how about rods, a valve job, etc?), but parts are readily available.  My ultimate goal is to either buy a low miles 1.8 motor or buy a cheap 1.8 motor to rebuild while I drive around with my existing 1.8."
Miata,3cfxiq,lastcall93,6,Tue Jul 7 16:35:54 2015 UTC,"It might have a lot of stuff on it, but $8000 is HUGE money for an NA. In Maine where I live, I wouldn't pay more than half that for a Miata, and I wouldn't pay a third of that for a car with rust on it. $8000 here will get you a car round about 10 to 12 years old, in really nice shape. I'd be worried about buying something that's been toyed with so much too. If that's the sort of thing you're looking for, make really sure that it's all done right. I'd have that car on the lift at my mechanic's and go over every inch of it. Know exactly where that oil is coming from at least."
Miata,3cfxiq,tony_rama,6,Tue Jul 7 17:16:46 2015 UTC,"Agreed. That is a stupid price for a car with rust and ~100k miles on the ODO. That should be offered for 6 and no one should pay more than $4k.  An $8k NA would be perfect inside and out, less than 40k miles, and not modified. Mods do not add to a cars value. You have no idea how well that kit was installed. This thing was likely driven hard and could be in rough shape.   Hard pass on this. Find a clean, unmodified NA with around 75k miles on it. You can pay $4-5k USD for one that is in perfect shape mechanically and body and interior.  Maybe I'm being harsh on price but rust on the rockers is a non starter. I am not very familiar with the Canadian prices but in the Seattle, WA area, clean first gens go for around 5k."

Miata,3cfxiq,wmweldon,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:56:09 2015 UTC,I guess but how much does it cost to rebuild a motor? About as much as a new kit probably.

Miata,3cfxiq,emptyminded42,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:58:16 2015 UTC,Even stock motors with 130k can be garbage. I learned that the hard way. It'd always tough to tell with a used car espically one that'd 25 years old.

Just unbolt the header, take off your timing belt, and disconnect fuel lines, sensors, and hoses.

Don't forget to drain the fluid and disconnect the battery before you start. Also a cam gear lock tool is nice for when you have to put the timing belt back on which is around $60.

Miata,3cdvmp,Konraden,1 point,Tue Jul 7 04:02:17 2015 UTC,I ended up passing on it because it would barely start and sounded horrible (loud like a dying lawnmower). It definitely wouldn't make it 45 minutes back to where I live. The car itself was clean and in awesome shape.  He bought it at an auction not too long ago and restores miatas himself but didn't have time for this.   I'm probably gonna be mad at myself later for not getting it though.

Miata,3cbiyn,Maggioman,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:52:38 2015 UTC,I didn't know that the Miata got its tach signal from spark. I thought that it got it from the Crank sensor or the Cam sensor.
Miata,3cbiyn,wireyladd,1 point,Mon Jul 6 21:09:52 2015 UTC,Depends on the year. 90-93 it came straight from the igniter.
Miata,3cbiyn,kokopelli73,1 point,Mon Jul 6 21:54:35 2015 UTC,"Almost all tachs work off a signal coming from the ignition (either the distributor, coil, or ecu). Technically it does get the ignition signal from the cam/crank to know when to fire off the coil(s), and in doing so creates a signal a tach can read."

You will also probably need extended top hats, the MSM shocks are longer than regular NB Billies and will raise your ride height otherwise. Check out the better bilstein eBay coilover thread on MT.net, the forums are a far better place for technical discussion. And don't just try to discuss, use the search ;)  All in my setup cost less than $550, and I didn't use any eBay parts. All-star sleeves, QA1 springs, and standard NB bumpstops. 20k on this setup, including many a time where ""Flyin' Miata"" literally described my car, not just the parts on it."
Miata,3cdhcq,OptionXIII,0,Tue Jul 7 03:42:32 2015 UTC,"Top hats and shock body length increase and decrease bump travel, not ride height."
Miata,3cdhcq,miatainkansas,1 point,Tue Jul 7 03:57:48 2015 UTC,"Right, its been a while. Must have been thinking about your minimum ride height. Can't go lower if the shock is already bottomed out and you're riding on the stops.  Or maybe it's to do with the circlip height. I don't recall, that's what the thread suggestion is for."
Miata,3ceetr,AlexHYS,2,Tue Jul 7 07:04:09 2015 UTC,"Yes to the first 3. If you do the work yourself, not much. Service parts for the Miata are not expressive. Yes to #5. What you need to fit in the car will depend on your leg/torso proportions. Most ""roll"" bars are a safety hazard. Just drive like everyone else on the road is trying to kill you. No idea on the seat. My car is stock and I've never scraped on anything."

It had to come off anyway, because the braces were rusty, so when that was fixed I put it on like this. The bar is supposed to keep your suitcase out of the cabin during a crash I think."

Check/replace the air filter, do the oils (gearbox + diff if you have the time) and check the radiator for brown plastic or dirty water for peace of mind and a baseline - all this stuff is super cheap if you can DIY as well.   Then, yeah timing if you want to. I increased mine from what I found to be lower than stock (8 deg) to 14 (run on 95/98 RON only) and it was really noticeable.   Going any further than that for HP performance though isn't worth chasing outside of the forced induction / expensive engine work world. Just learn to drive it with momentum and do what you can with the tyres and suspension set up :-)  Protip if doing gearbox/diff oil - always crack the fill bolt before you undo the drain bolt!"

Miata,3ccvtj,Andydav,1 point,Mon Jul 6 23:39:43 2015 UTC,"Scribly has covered all the main points here. The one thing i would suggest is a slightly heftier viscosity mineral oil when you service it. I use Shell Helix HX5 15/40 (i think..) and it's lovely and thick. It also minimised Hydraulic Lift Actuator tap that the MX5's are prone to.   As for your Leads, go with Magnecor Comp leads. I think i got mine for about £65 but that was about 4 years ago now.   Moss Europe do a lovely exhaust system that can be used to extract a little more throttle response (barely noticeable, but the sound alone is worth it). The system is called Cobalt.

Some random thoughts in no particular order of significance:   Wave to other NA, NB, NC drivers! (Soon to add ND to that list!) Sunscreen. Apply generously. Remove your sun visors. All you need is a screwdriver. They're pointless in a convertible and reduce the already limited windshield real estate. Operate under the assumption that nobody EVER sees you in their blindspots or next to you. EVER. You might experience this: I have this ever growing paranoia of someone breaking into my car -- or worse, tear up my soft top -- when I park it overnight in Chicago. I don't lock my doors to deter tearing nor do I keep anything expensive in the glove compartment or center console (still lock those). Nothing has happened.. Yet.. Get used to filling up gas more regularly. I fill up every 3-4 days. 11 gallon tank is TINY. I carry two keys with me at all times. One for the engine. Another because I always start the car and realize I forgot to unlock the glove compartment, center console, or the trunk (no trunk release option for me). It's a hassle to shut off the engine, unlock something, and then re-start the engine. If you have a trunk release, you may want to consider disabling it for safety reasons? Register your I-Pass/EZ-pass. I've had MULTIPLE difficulties getting the tollways to read my transponder due to the small size of the car.

Miata,3c98v1,Arkapella,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:40:39 2015 UTC,Yea I originally had my splitter spliced off of the cigarette lighter and it turned on with the key. The wiring gauge is really small though so I would suggest just using one of these. The dashcam indeed starts up recording.
Miata,3c98v1,MijnWraak,2,Mon Jul 6 20:07:09 2015 UTC,"Digging the faux-KG cluster. A set of revlimiter gauges and a KG cluster are on my long list for interior mods.   How much did it run you to make that cluster? Any reason not do the four center lights?   Any plans for the single-din space under the radio?  Also, do you have a running build log on miata.net? Would love to see what you ended up ordering (with links!)."
Miata,3c98v1,c6k,0,Mon Jul 6 02:58:31 2015 UTC,"How much did it run you to make that cluster? Any reason not do the four center lights?   Plexiglass  $17.00 Polystyrene $15.00 Chrome Rings    $50.00 Gauge Cluster   $30.00 Pilot Lights    $30.00  Total: ~$140 with extra material. The chrome rings were overpriced IMO but they are hard to find and probably necessary. The amount of time I put into making them almost makes the price of the authentic KG Works cluster reasonable. I originally was going to replace the 4 center lights but I cracked the plexiglass so I just improvised. That said, I actually like them better this way as it's more unique and easy to tell what each light is indicating. I was going to label the lights but that proved to be a nightmare so I am just leaving them as-is.    Any plans for the single-din space under the radio?   Hmm.. Maybe. I was saving the space for extra gauges/toggle switched if I ended up needing them but a little slot would be handy.    Also, do you have a running build log on miata.net? Would love to see what you ended up ordering (with links!).    I do not but most of that can be found in my submission/post history."
Miata,3c98v1,Shaggyv108,2,Mon Jul 6 03:12:02 2015 UTC,"That cluster should be illegal it's so gorgeous, I'd spend more time looking at that than the road."
Miata,3c98v1,Young_Maker,1 point,Mon Jul 6 05:37:16 2015 UTC,"So I thought I was finished but a few things were still bugging me. The worst of which being the dash. I tried to simply spray over the gooey dash (which actually stopped it from being sticky) however it was peeling away after only a couple weeks. I ended up tearing the dash out again and while scraping away the paint and goo a discovered that underneath it was a nice ""untouched"" textured plastic surface the same tan color as the rest of the interior. I decided to just leave it like that and did my best to get all of the paint and goo off (actually turned out really good). Now I won't have to worry about the paint peeling or scuffs! While I had the dash off, I took the chance to clean up my previous accessory wiring. I had originally spliced a 4-way 12v splitter off of the cigarette lighter so I rewired it to the room fuse and added the toggle switch panel under the steering wheel. I also added LED lighting under the dash and seats. I broke down and ordered some Revlimiter gauges which look beautiful despite me clumsily scuffing them a bit during the install. I routed the GPS and dashcam wiring through the pillar/windshield panels and tucked the dashcam out of sight behind the rear-view mirror after /u/lumaco pointed out how much they blocked my view of the road. The center black dash panel wasn't fitting very well and left a slight gap at the top so I ended up screwing it in place (before it was just held on by little plastic clips). The speaker cover was starting to peal and the metal cover kept falling off so I super glued it in place and sprayed it with Krylon Fusion which seems to be holding up a LOT better. I also sprayed the center columns with the same and replaced the gear shift pattern sticker with an oem replacement I had previously ordered. I also added a fire extinguisher to the passenger foot-well but I'm not sure if you can see it in these pics. I fixed the glove-box gap with some washers. I forgot to mention that I replaced the HVAC panel in my last update."

Miata,3c8e4c,BlitzWing1985,2,Mon Jul 6 06:09:01 2015 UTC,I was close to getting a berk a few years back but knowing the problems late model NAs have with getting exhaust parts put me off. If you did not know in 97-98 the UK model's they have a longer 475mm cat so unless you also want to fit a new downpipe and cat your exhaust choice is limited. I found this out the hard way with my old 97
Miata,3c8e4c,BlitzWing1985,1 point,Mon Jul 6 12:24:51 2015 UTC,I didn't know that actually. Cheers for the info. I'm looking to keep it as close to the original as possibly. So unless the exhaust completely falls apart I won't be changing it.
Miata,3c8e4c,TuffGnarl,1 point,Mon Jul 6 15:31:29 2015 UTC,It's not as bad as I've made it out to be. Swapping over to the more common 440mm is easy if you have a spanner set. But good luck keeping it stock I found the modding bug too hard to resist.

Miata,3cbjif,69th,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:34:25 2015 UTC,"Buy another beater. Sounds like you're not the best candidate for an Exocet, given your driving record, and it also sounds like you probably can't afford to build a race car. Just my two cents."
Miata,3cbjif,69th,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:32:35 2015 UTC,Yeah I'm definitely not going for an Exocet. Just wondering what would be a better option economically to part out/sell vs buying a rolling shell and using parts from the crashed car. :/
Miata,3cbjif,emptyminded42,1 point,Mon Jul 6 19:25:17 2015 UTC,"Don't buy a shell and swap parts in. Better off buying the same exact car, one that's running well, and save the crashed one for spares. That's what I'd do in your case, anyways. Maybe sell the interior parts."
Miata,3c91oo,alostsoldier,6,Mon Jul 6 01:03:50 2015 UTC,I am more concerned with the massive amount of silicone on the tires.
Miata,3c91oo,SternLecture,-1,Mon Jul 6 03:06:02 2015 UTC,I'm going to advise you not to use tire shine (since it looks like you have). It dries your tires out and makes them look worse as well as being slightly worse structurally over time
Miata,3c91oo,ArguablyTasty,5,Mon Jul 6 01:53:48 2015 UTC,Ha. Tireshine. I'll have to tell him that. He spray-painted the steelies and was too lazy to give a fuck.

Miata,3c91oo,ArguablyTasty,-1,Mon Jul 6 14:09:13 2015 UTC,"You don't tire shine the tread, you shine the side wall   No shit..  However, it does not prevent cracking, it causes cracking. Hence the advise. Yes, sunlight contributes to it more than tire shine, but why make it worse?"
Miata,3c91oo,Troybylt,1 point,Mon Jul 6 14:11:28 2015 UTC,...My years of auto detailing disagree with you.   Were you useing brake fluid to shine or something? Thst would crack them. The whole point of tire shine is to prolong the life and appearance of the tire.
Miata,3c91oo,ArguablyTasty,1 point,Mon Jul 6 14:14:28 2015 UTC,"My years in a tire shop disagree with you. Tire shine is absolutely not used to prolong life of a tire, it's used to enhance the appearance at the cost of the life. The reason being that it prevents the antiozonant from reacting with the air and protecting the tire from UV rays. It works its way to the surface as tires roll. However, petroleum-based tire shines prevent it from doing so. As a result, more UV damage  From Michelin"
Miata,3c91oo,Troybylt,1 point,Mon Jul 6 14:28:43 2015 UTC,"""Petroleum or alcohol based products"" others are unknown.  I know petroleum or alcohol would hurt the rubber, so as long as I keep using what I'm useing I'll be fine. It's water based.   I've also spent years as a Toyota Technician and I've seen my fair share of tires come through. We're going to have to agree to disagree here. But I appreciate you supporting your stance on more than just opinion."

Miata,3c9m9b,soap_monger,5,Mon Jul 6 04:20:05 2015 UTC,my miata was like this when i first bought it. it means whoever installed the top did a shit job and didn't glue down the vinyl on the front.  be prepared to buy a new top because that one is going to fail early from the PO's shit install.
Miata,3c9m9b,c6k,3,Mon Jul 6 13:38:11 2015 UTC,"I'd say ask the owner about it. If they're smart, they'll be honest about it."
Miata,3c9m9b,69th,4,Mon Jul 6 18:34:32 2015 UTC,"Its a tell tale sign that either the PO was negligible when installing a new top and bent the frame, or the car was in an accident. My miata had the same issue and it was caused by an accident the PO had. A new top frame and top fixed my issues, but unless you're ready to handle the potential issues of a wrecked car I'd suggest moving on."
Miata,3c9m9b,opticbyte,4,Mon Jul 6 05:07:20 2015 UTC,bent frame would be a tell tale on the front part of the soft top.... not the sides... that's just really poor installation and/or poor quality/cheap soft top.

Miata,3c73gl,blazefalcon,3,Sun Jul 5 14:12:19 2015 UTC,"I'm sure you've come across this already, but look at the Tokico Illumina and Flyin' Miata Spring combo for a solid setup. I'd personally prefer a stiffer suspension, but since you're not going to a track, it will probably be stiff enough (race springs usually run at 550 lbs/in, but FM Springs run at 300 or so). This is what Flyin' Miata offers in their Stage 1 Suspension Package.  I'm sure there are alternatives, but I'm fairly happy with the setup. Can feel more of the road, but it doesn't come close to killing me or anything (drove 3 1/2 hours recently and had a lot of fun honestly).  Let me know what you decide on, because I'm definitely interested in hearing other spring/shock combos for the car :)"
Miata,3c73gl,22quack,3,Sun Jul 5 14:41:51 2015 UTC,My car came fm 2.5. the shock spring combo is very tame. Full stiff is great when I know I want to have fun but still not too stiff. Just cruising you can really soften it up and float around. Very solid stuff.
Miata,3c73gl,rnepmc,2,Sun Jul 5 14:48:05 2015 UTC,"See, I'm just nervous about the flyin miata setup because with the Teins I feel that if I absolutely hate them I can sell them quick and have minimal loss. With the FM that's like twice the cost and much more of a niche market I'd say, so I'd be at much more of a risk.   A big problem I'm having is that all suspension reviews I've read are useless. On any given setup, it's one person saying it's so stiff it'll shake your teeth out and the next person saying you could run over a small child and feel nothing. Most reviews and criticisms are from track racers, so I'm even starting to consider Racelands at this point."
Miata,3c73gl,Cat4lyst,1 point,Sun Jul 5 15:38:02 2015 UTC,"You can hardly say the fm setup is niche. One of the most popular viable option out there. Also don't expect any slightly used shock is going fetch decent money on the used market. You're gonna loose money and lots of it selling used, it's better to just get it right the first time.  That said, I like the koni yellow with fm springs. illumina is good too. If you can't afford a similar setup, i recommend to just forget it and stay stock. if you not concerned with ride height maybe just get some good adjustable shocks and keep the springs? This is bare minimum imo. Raceland is a waste of money with longevity factored in, ride quality will be poor"
Miata,3c73gl,gearhead2,1 point,Sun Jul 5 16:34:09 2015 UTC,"I can afford the purchase price no problem, I just can't afford to purchase and repurchase again and again if it's really that bad. I can do a shock/spring setup, but even that with Konis or Bilstein HDs is going to be just as expensive as most pre-made coilovers with more difficult adjustment.   Do you think the Teins would really be bad for a street-only cruiser? The only complaint that I've heard has been that it's too soft for performance use, which doesn't really affect me."
Miata,3c73gl,Cat4lyst,2,Sun Jul 5 16:48:56 2015 UTC,"You haven't even mentioned height adjustability, that alone is enough to make me go teins"

I don't think the damping will be as good compared to if you went with the koni or bilstein with a spring for  around the same price. then again it's something you might not notice. the teins are a decent coilover for street use, and I agree these would probably sell faster in the used market."

Miata,3c73gl,gearhead2,1 point,Sun Jul 5 14:56:28 2015 UTC,I bought the Tien Street Advance with adjustable shocks and ride height.   I fucking love them.  Combined with the FM sway bars and my car can handle way better than I can drive.   I understand everyone loves FM.  But their shit is expensive.  I beat the shit out of my car all the time.  No problems after 40k miles.   I really like the adjustable shocks.  You can really fine tune your ride. My car is set to over steer in corner entry of in going to fast.  But it only steps out a little then settles.    When i am in the grove its insane. I usually come into corners a little slower than i could because death amd all. But once i get in it i hold the throttlr open as i go around the turn and the rear end plants. I know i have pulled over a G once in a while.  The only downsude is when yoh make the shocks soft the car kind of bounces too much. So i always keep them set ti stiff. I think im 4 in the front and 3 in the rear with 0 being stiffest.  For some reason i have never tried 0.  I love the set up. You will to.  Ps they are stiffer then stock. But they wont kill you. My wife loves the feel if the car and she is not a car person.  At work i get to drive race cars on the road from time to time. Those things suck. This setup will make you happy on backroads with irregularities.

Your boyfriend is a dumbass.  Yes it's the tires. The LSD will only grab when it's easier for the tires to slip than the clutches in the LSD. Tires with less traction means this happens sooner in a corner especially under acceleration. Plus the inside tire is always more likely to spin.   Nearly every aspect of a car is affected by changeing tires. The tire is responsible for transfering all input from the driver and engine to the road, and all feel of the road and traction back to the driver. All cornering response, acceleration, breaking, road noise, road feel etc. tires are HUGE deal change them up and you're bound to see a big difference in performance especially going from a great tire to a shit tire.

Miata,3c592n,Hypopyon,2,Sun Jul 5 01:29:25 2015 UTC,"Fluid should have no noticeable impact on a torsen, old fluid may actually increase responce time in a torsen due to being less lubricating, meaning a torsen is less likely to bias and more likely to turn as a unit due to increase friction of the worm gears.

Miata,3c592n,BlueBeetle73,1 point,Sun Jul 5 04:47:55 2015 UTC,"Fluid should have no noticeable impact on a torsen, old fluid may actually increase responce time in a torsen due to being less lubricating, meaning a torsen is less likely to bias and more likely to turn as a unit due to increase friction of the worm gears."
Miata,3c592n,Troybylt,1 point,Sun Jul 5 05:11:05 2015 UTC,Fluid swap can also produce different LSD characteristics but 100 to 1 it's the tires. I run the Z2SS as well and chinese no-name tires aren't going to have anywhere near the traction the Z2SS has.

Miata,3c592n,Popsiclestix1234,3,Sun Jul 5 02:45:46 2015 UTC,The Miata's Torsen diff does not need a friction modifier added to it.
Miata,3c592n,dajohnnyboy,1 point,Sun Jul 5 04:48:48 2015 UTC,"No torsens use worm gears, you only need a friction modifier if you have a clutch type LSD no other LSD requires it, also a friction modifier is to make up for lower quality fluid, you shouldn't need a modifier when useing Redline, amsoil, or something in the top tier range."
Miata,3c592n,Troybylt,0,Sun Jul 5 05:08:04 2015 UTC,It could be locking better so its actually spinning the outside wheel causing the squeak.

Miata,3c5qv8,justanotherjohn999,8,Sun Jul 5 01:56:15 2015 UTC,Your A/C drain line is clogged.  Its a simple fix it just needs to be blown out with some compressed air.
Miata,3c5qv8,salusrab,1 point,Sun Jul 5 02:05:39 2015 UTC,Thanks. I'll try it.
Miata,3c5qv8,Sir_not_sir,5,Sun Jul 5 03:15:24 2015 UTC,Your HVAC drain is clogged. It's on the engine side of the firewall below and behind the intake manifold.
Miata,3c5qv8,Sunburst34,5,Sun Jul 5 02:00:04 2015 UTC,"I agree that the AC drain is plugged. If you have an NA, though, the drain hose is not where /u/Sir_not_sir describes. There is a large box under the dash on the passenger side, behind the glove box. The evaporator for the AC is inside it. The drain hose runs from the bottom rear of that box through a hole in the passenger side of the transmission tunnel. If you look under the dash in the passenger footwell, near the firewall, you will it. It's a short black molded rubber hose, I'd say approximately six inches long.   You can pull the upper end of the hose off the evaporator box, and the entire hose can then be removed (the other end just passes through a grommet in the trans tunnel -- it isn't attached. Check and see if it's blocked. If so, blow it out or carefully clear it with a flexible wire. Reinstall and you should be ok.   In some cases, the drain hose isn't clogged, though. If yours isn't clogged, then the problem is in the evaporator box and not the drain hose. There is no cabin air filter on these cars, so debris can build up in the evaporator box and plug the outlet at the bottom (that the hose connects to). If that's the case, you may be able to temporarily clear it with a burst of compressed air, but it will quickly clog back up again. The only fix at that point is to open up the evap box and clean it out. I had to do that for my 95 last summer and found a lot of pine needles and other dirt had built up over the years. To get at the box, you need to remove the glove box, disconnect the clamps holding the air tubes to the intake and exhaust sides of it, and remove a half dozen or so little metal clips that attach the upper and lower halves. You will not be able to completely pull it out, though, as there AC high and low pressure lines run through the firewall (removing it completely requires disconnecting those lines, which then means a complete purge and recharge of freon when you put it all back together). You can get enough space to clean it out, though."
Miata,3c5qv8,Sunburst34,1 point,Sun Jul 5 06:13:31 2015 UTC,Good call. It is an ns. Looks like it was the hose but now I can't get I attached to the evap box. Any tricks? I just yanked it out.

Miata,3c4hwq,PsychonautMIA,1 point,Sat Jul 4 19:31:06 2015 UTC,"So it seems I may have over paid a little, I got the car for 7k.    I look at it like this: it has two owners, and 120k for a 94 isn't that bad, also has clean title and good service records. I have receipts for the build and paint has a three year warranty from a shop that had great reviews. Megasquirt was tuned by a shop in Charlotte NC with Dyno sheets showing 210whp. If I were to build this car I could get a miata for, let's say, 2000, paint and body was 2300, FM ii was 3500, megasquirt was 400 (?), wheels are worth minimum 1000, and tires 400, coilovers could be bought for 750. Misc things like clutch, fuel pump, exhaust could be done for 500.    So, for 8-10k I could build the car depending on if I got new or used parts. I also am hoping since it is an M edition it may not depreciate as fast, but if it does, whatever, it's still the most fun I've had driving a car and that's what really matters to me!"

Miles mean a lot and 120k with a turbo kit would turn a lot of buyers off, plus mods. Don't get me wrong, this is a well done build but I agree, somewhere around $5k if the prospective buyer likes all the mods. Mods really don't do much value wise, even well done ones.

Miata,3c4hwq,alnelon,3,Sat Jul 4 21:46:28 2015 UTC,"Mods depreciate, they don't add a lot of value to a car. If all the modifications were removed the stock car would bring in 3500 and the rest of the mods (sold alone) would bring in a lot more. As it is, it's a niche vehicle that's receiving more wear everyday, it's not going to sell that high when someone can get an original car with 1/3 the mileage for the same price (and then do their own modifications)."
Miata,3c4hwq,RockinHawkin,2,Sat Jul 4 23:49:03 2015 UTC,"In Texas, no mx5 with AC delete will EVER go that high unless it's a spec car. Not to mention the fact that mods detract resale value more than add it even if you have receipts. Boosting Miatas is absurdly cheap and easy anyway.

It's not an M-edition but they won't really know the difference. I would go there and ask them, most dealerships will bite at any price close to it because they know they will make more selling it in house than selling it at an auction.

A tiny bend somewhere can make a huge difference in the overall geometry, so not really much you can do yourself by eyeball.

Miata,3c36lp,StayRiceForLifeBro94,2,Sat Jul 4 20:07:12 2015 UTC,It looks clean I'd say check it out. Let the engine warm up ticking will go away if any and if it doesn't knock $200 off the price. Lay on the ground look for rust if any knock $200 off the price. MOST IMPORTANT do not let the amazing test drive you will have trick you into buying it if the are problems with the engine and/tranny. Push in the clutch shift through every gear even reverse and wiggle the shifter. If there is alot of play like that mother fucker moves around in gear similar to neutral knock another $200 off the price new syncos are in order. Also look for any wobbles of the harmonic balancer. If there is any now listen if there is any significant wobble to the harmonic balancer fuck that car and look at a different one you'll have to pull the engine to fix that...... I'm in the process of buying a miata myself and I got the dealer from $4500 to $3200 because of these very problems minus the harmonic balancer obviously otherwise I would have said fuck that car.
Miata,3c36lp,Krystal_Thorn,1 point,Sun Jul 5 04:13:27 2015 UTC,"Sorry if it's a vague question, but what will the harmonic balancer sound like if it's bad? The car is in the great state of Alabama, so rust is unlikely, though. Thanks for the tip about the shifter, too!"
Miata,3c36lp,StayRiceForLifeBro94,1 point,Sun Jul 5 04:32:49 2015 UTC,Welp my current car needs it replaced it doesn't make any noise just a shit ton of vibration felt throughout the car ie the car vibrates so bad the mirrors shake at idle and yes all my motor mounts are brand new and installed proplerly. I took it to a shop that is ASE certified that's how you know they do great work. It's doesn't seem bad yet the whole point of the harmonic balancers existence is to absorb the vibration from the crank shaft. If the balancer is bad the crankshaft will vibrate the engine to death ie... Crankshaft will break and fun fact your piston rods are connected to it. A $30 part requires the engine to be pulled on like 90% of cars which is expensive at $100hr labor and it will take no less than three hours to do depending on the car it could take half a day... So since some people are shady they will sell you the car with this problem and when you have it towed back they will fix it and add it to your loan. It happened to my dad awhile back. He bought 1999 dodge Dakota for work and it had so much vibration and poof engine gone. Got it swapped and $7000 more dollars paid over the course of two years added to his loan (for a $9500 truck is ridiculous). As I tell everyone take the car for a prepurchase inspection it could save you from buying a money pit. A $40-$100 inspection or a (insert price of vehicle bought from dealership here) problem.

This only took us about a minute to do, so really its incredibly easy to break into a miata. Obviously a hard top would be a good prevention, but I'm not sure if anyone is willing to shell out $800 just for antitheft.  But just keep in mind how easy it is to get into an NA with a soft top."
Miata,3c109f,donegallite,1 point,Sat Jul 4 13:56:08 2015 UTC,Relocate the radio to the trunk and put a cover where it would have been. You can buy controls to put on your wheel or in the plastic cover where the radio was. People have done it before here for the same reason.
Miata,3c109f,Nopethefuckout94,1 point,Fri Jul 3 19:55:48 2015 UTC,"I was hoping for something more like bolts that only a special wrench will fit. Best of all would be a spy camera that would never be noticed, but it could get stolen if anybody happened onto its hiding place. Still, you'd think that nobody could disassemble a dashboard in broad daylight in a suburban parking lot. Signs of the times I guess."
Miata,3c109f,EkkuZakku,1 point,Mon Jul 6 05:53:25 2015 UTC,"I got a dashcam that has the camera separate from the recording/control box, called the Koonlung K1S. It's pretty expensive for a dashcam, but like hell I'm going to have somebody break into my car and get away with it. Thought I'd let you know."
Miata,3c109f,tjr97,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:11:36 2015 UTC,"Koonlung K1S I had a break-in recently in an unoccupied house that I am getting ready to sell. They actually ripped a game camera off the wall, where it was very securely blind-bolted down. They must have been strong guys with long wrecking bars. I'm thinking of taking the camera works, which they didn't quite manage to destroy, and separating the memory from the rest of the device, then putting the memory somewhere where they couldn't find it.    Thanks for the tip."

Miata,3c109f,StayRiceForLifeBro94,1 point,Mon Jul 6 05:49:06 2015 UTC,Just take the faceplate of your head unit inside or fuck just lock it in your glovebox. The radio is useless with out it man. Most people who steal shit don't have a plan they peak in the window and see the radio is missing and voila they don't attempt the break in. They go to the next car.
Miata,3c1tlu,thedailystrain,5,Fri Jul 3 23:49:25 2015 UTC,"The Miata is a two seat convertible. The other cars in your list are four seat, convertible or not. It's also the newest of the four.  You'll need to drive one in order to truly appreciate the light weight and handling."

Miata,3bxwt3,airshow_announcer,5,Fri Jul 3 01:55:00 2015 UTC,I really like that rear finish panel! It looks like an Australian one. Or is it a replica?
Miata,3bxwt3,taterr_salad,5,Fri Jul 3 03:55:48 2015 UTC,you can find them super cheap in the EU as kids want to go with the import/US style.

Miata,3bz2oh,Puzz1es,10,Fri Jul 3 08:53:32 2015 UTC,"The NA is very reliable. Just replace the master and slave clutch cylinders when they fail, service it regularly and enjoy the ride! The safety is that of a 20+ years old car with no roof though. If you live in a rainy area you want to be careful when it rains since the lack of ABS could be a problem for a novice driver. The lack of A\C might be another problem as well. My NA is my daily driver and I live in a fairly hot place... driving it during the summer sucks :)"
Miata,3bz2oh,bse50,5,Fri Jul 3 11:50:06 2015 UTC,"I have a 98 MK2 with 168,000km. I'm in Ireland.  A few little things have come up in the last year. Nothing big and nothing expensive.  IL Motorsport in Germany are your friend, forget about trying to buy anything online from the UK while the Euro is the way it is...  In my experience, You'll probably need to do the spark plug leads, they're a short service life item, and bad leads will not help the MX5's (not very good) coil packs. Maybe also recondition the alternator, I need to do that now.  But the great thing about the MX5 is how easy it is to work on. Everyone works on their MX5, and there is a tutorial online for absolutely anything that you would ever need to do!  You will have to fix some things on a 20 year old car on an ongoing basis. Not strand you on the side of the road things, more lazy Sunday when you get the time type things.  Also, the MX5 has a magical thing. A non interference timing belt. On most cars, if your timing belt fails, your engine will eat it's self. On an MX5, your engine just stops working until you fix it."
Miata,3bz2oh,IfailedAFF1,5,Fri Jul 3 11:53:28 2015 UTC,Sounds great. Are there some things I need to look out for specifically when buying one?
Miata,3bz2oh,IfailedAFF1,6,Fri Jul 3 12:01:56 2015 UTC,"Are there some things I need to look out for specifically when buying one?   Oh yeah, RUST!!  Here's a PDF of a full checklist I found on MX5Ireland  If you follow that, you'll miss nothing!"
Miata,3bz2oh,BountyHNZ,3,Fri Jul 3 12:09:35 2015 UTC,"Yes! the NA mx5 is essentially my first car (I had motorcycles first).  Reliability is great, daily use is spot on. In winter the cabin warms up quickly, and in summer it cools down quickly (especially if you drop the top!). If your soft top leaks it can be a bit crap. Mine did and I lived with it for about a year. Cheap to run.  Because the mx5 handles so nicely it's a wonderful first car. As a learner you'll find the under powered engine means you have to work fairly hard to find yourself in a sticky situation. Chances are, as a novice, if you do find yourself in a sticky situation the handling will go a long way to getting you unstuck."
Miata,3bz2oh,69th,3,Fri Jul 3 12:52:34 2015 UTC,"Yes, it's reliable, if you keep in mind how old the car is. It will have rust. Check the frame (Google it, plenty of walkthroughs on what to check) for rust. If there's rust on the front fenders, you can replace them for cheap. Rear fenders, it's probably not too bad, and you can probably bondo it after cleaning it up.   Regardless of what the soon-to-be previous owner says, it's in your best interest to change the timing belt/water pump, unless they can prove that they recently changed them both within 70k miles (or around 100,000km, I think).   Try to get one with a hard top if you're concerned about safety. That said, a roll bar will provide better protection than that. Not one of the chrome hump-behind-the-seats style bars, those are not the same thing at all. Hard dog is a decent, affordable brand"
Miata,3bz2oh,dpidcoe,3,Fri Jul 3 13:25:58 2015 UTC,Are hardtops/softtops different models or can you put a hardttop on any one of them?
Miata,3bz2oh,gumert,4,Fri Jul 3 13:43:33 2015 UTC,"You can put a hardtop on any one of them. The softtop remains folded back if a hardtop is installed, so it's not particularly hard to switch between the two."
Miata,3bz2oh,69th,3,Fri Jul 3 15:00:29 2015 UTC,You can put a hard top on any soft top car. The hard top was the same for the first two generations. If your car did not have a factory hard top you will need to buy and install two mounting points that are near the seat belt shoulder mounts.
Miata,3bz2oh,halsey1006,0,Fri Jul 3 16:27:10 2015 UTC,"Gotta have the model-specific one. Not 100% sure, but I think it goes like, 90-93, 94-97. I forget exactly."

Miata,3byszj,Ddreder,2,Fri Jul 3 16:06:34 2015 UTC,"It is worth every penny.  It obviously does not have the strong community and multiplayer aspect like iracing, but the simulation is spot on.  I would argue that Assetto Corsa is the most accurate sim available right now."
Miata,3byszj,Ddreder,2,Fri Jul 3 16:30:30 2015 UTC,Yea.. I just want good multiplayer. I raced in a very nice GT6 league for almost a year and it was amazing fun. From what I can tell AC doesn't have the multiplayer structure to support something like that. Regardless I will buy it because I like well made sims.
Miata,3byszj,GeckoDeLimon,2,Fri Jul 3 16:35:22 2015 UTC,"It doesn't, but there are plenty of online leagues, PC and console. Heck, I know of at least one virtual Spec Miata racing series!"
Miata,3byszj,Ddreder,2,Sat Jul 4 05:41:41 2015 UTC,Haha yea I think I saw a spec miata league on like iracing or something. I really wanted to try it out. Whoever makes the fewest mistakes.. Wins! Lol

Miata,3byszj,GeckoDeLimon,2,Fri Jul 3 20:09:14 2015 UTC,"True, and I do appreciate the uncanny way the controller somehow manages to communicate what the wheels are doing (I dont get that feeling with Turismo). But... they're not wheels. Forza has such shitty wheel support. There's the Fanatec, and that's it. I've given up on wheels on consoles. Both of my wheels have been better PC wheels than console wheels, even if I can't get Need For Speed: Hot Pursuit 2 to properly recognize the wheel."

The stuff is a little pricey but you can buy pretty much the same stuff from a shoe shop for use on suede shoes way cheaper, I just prefer to buy a big bottle of the stuff, the bottle from the shoe shop only does like 2 coats, and in all honesty I think that's all you'd need to rejuvenate it and a go with the brushes, but I clean and armour all the interior every month so why not do the suede too.

Those are kinda unrelated when taking things apart, but if they're leaking at all I would do them both. Make sure to torque the valve cover on right and in the right order too. Make sure also to use RTV on some corners, it'll be obvious, and to scrape away any old gasket left on there."

Two lane road, an SUV crossed the double yellow into my brother's lane, he avoided the head-on, but dropped the right hand wheels off into wet pine straw, and well, that's all she wrote.  One brother tried to kill her and another finished her off.  There's something poetic about it.  Every corner's suspension is toast, wheels and tires are hulk smashed, subframes are likely bent, there's bodywork damage all around, but the airbags didn't go off.  I'm pretty sure she's totaled.

Miata,3bvqyb,shunsushi,2,Thu Jul 2 20:25:46 2015 UTC,"Easy, your driver's seat is an NA6 seat. Belt bracket mounts to the chassis instead."
Miata,3bvqyb,PrintError,2,Thu Jul 2 20:56:58 2015 UTC,"You have mixed seats. Your passenger seat is from a 95-97 model (maybe 94 had that design, too). There is a rail on the side of the seat that the belt receiver bolts to. The earlier cars (90-93 or perhaps 94) don't have those rails. Instead, the seatbelt receivers bolt directly to the transmission tunnel. In my 95, I actually swapped out the original seatbelts and receivers for the earlier type. The mounting locations were still there but had a rubber plug in them."
Miata,3bvqyb,Sunburst34,1 point,Thu Jul 2 21:11:29 2015 UTC,"Thanks to everyone for the replies. The PO had two 1.6 miatas in the family, so it makes sense that my 1.8 acquired a 1.6 seat at some point in its life.  The 1.8 seatbelt receiver bolts to both the seat and the tunnel, but it sounds like the 1.6 only bolted to the tunnel.  It looks like I need to get a 1.8 seat, a 1.6 receiver, or go to aftermarket seats and harnesses.  I've sent inquires about this to two used miata parts vendors and neither suggested this. It does make perfect sense though."
Miata,3bvqyb,shunsushi,2,Thu Jul 2 21:29:00 2015 UTC,I suggest you to find the reciever. I got a pair of those in a parts lot for 50$ with other goodies.. Might find them cheap.
Miata,3bvqyb,ksuzzo,2,Thu Jul 2 22:04:52 2015 UTC,I believe the 1.6 seats will bolt to a set of 1.8 sliders with the receiver on it.
Miata,3bvqyb,ksuzzo,1 point,Thu Jul 2 23:46:12 2015 UTC,"Ah, so the seatbelt mounting point might be part of the seat rail and not the actual seat. That would make life easier. Miatas are somewhat scarce around here, so I am going to have to get my part(s) shipped in."

Also, don't be afraid to go to your local Advanced Auto Parts and ask for advice. They are willing to give you advice and help you get what you need for any job. My local one will even come out and take a look at your car and see if the problem you think exists, actually exists, or if it is something else.

Miata,3bsp6p,Griffin-dork,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:32:01 2015 UTC,"Haha that might have been me actually. Yeah if you don't know it's not a bad idea. The process is simple, my problem was lining it up after, tensioning the belt etc. which was just a chore as it always is. And in the end I didn't notice any difference in noise or anything so I'm not sure I can say it was worth the effort and risk of snapping a bolt or something. Basically you're just pulling it off, taking out the 8-10 bolts that hold the snout on, and carefully splitting it (all the oil will come out). Check for any obviously damaged or worn parts, if it's all good clean it up a bit and put it back together carefully. Tighten the bolts well as it's a metal on metal seal, in an order like 1-5-3-8-2 etc. Then hold it upside down to access the fill hole and fill it until it's about to overflow. put the fill screw back in, and toss that guy back on the engine. I'm about to head out but let me know if you want more details etc, I can take a look at mine and give you better descriptions if you want."
Miata,3bsp6p,EntroperZero,2,Thu Jul 2 21:25:55 2015 UTC,"Ive been in the car ""scene"" for about 8 years. Ive owned my miata for 6 of those. I still havent turbo'd it. Could I? yeah. I have a Garrett T25 sitting at home that would work well on it. But the rest of the car needs to be setup first. I just did a 1.8 swap in my 90 NA last winter, so this is my first full summer really driving it. Its 100% solid. Only a couple things I really need to take care of and its turbo ready. I will have to put a clutch in it, but oh well. The rest is ready to go.   Learn how to do just about everything on your car. Wrench on it and do ALL the maintenance. Get familiar to working on it and where things are. Basically go through everything and replace anything that is old/worn. Make sure the engine is healthy and has fresh gaskets throughout. Then you are ready for a turbo and will most likely have the know how then."
Miata,3bsp6p,LusciousPear,1 point,Thu Jul 2 16:22:15 2015 UTC,"Beginner-level stuff is easy: oil changes, gear/diff oil, coolant, oxygen sensors, etc.  Once you can do that stuff, I think a great intermediate-level project is changing your timing belt.  It'll take you a whole day, requires reading and planning, but isn't physically difficult on a Miata."

Miata,3bsp6p,Griffin-dork,1 point,Thu Jul 2 08:18:34 2015 UTC,"I'm afraid I don't know. If you're that concerned with doing it yourself, it would be a good idea to get in touch with any local Miata clubs or specialists who already have experience with doing it successfully."
Miata,3bsp6p,FlamingBrad,1 point,Thu Jul 2 08:24:50 2015 UTC,"What CRCasper said. If you're really uncomfortable doing it, it's best to have someone else come do it that has done it before. People HAVE failed and hit the sump before... that's why I tried to include my tips in this video. Trust me I was nervous doing it, and it was the 2nd car I've done it on. Unfortunately you have to drain your turbo this way so there's not really a way around it."
Miata,3bsp6p,Griffin-dork,1 point,Thu Jul 2 13:28:41 2015 UTC,"Superchargers do not require oil feeds. I know some people who kind of do it the ""easy"" way and run an adapter from the oil filter, in between the filter and the block. This gives you a feed and return line. Im not sure if this is really the correct way to go about doing it or if its correct. If a car came non turbo, then its not going to have an oil return line on the oil pan."
Miata,3bsp6p,MightyPenguin,1 point,Thu Jul 2 16:25:27 2015 UTC,There's no real difference as far as I know. If you don't want to drill an adapter is definitely the way to go.
Miata,3bsp6p,Griffin-dork,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:41:26 2015 UTC,"Huh, interesting. I may go that route then. Way easier. If I do end up drilling the pan, then I will most likely just pull the motor again to make sure everything is all good. I hate working on engines in cars haha. So much easier on an engine stand."
Miata,3bsp6p,Geteos,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:06:52 2015 UTC,"Dude, don't worry and just do it how he said. Drilling and tapping the pan took me 15 mins and was scary at first, but after doing it I'm not sure what I was scared of. It went well, was super easy, and I wouldn't hesitate doing it again. On the 1.6's its great because you already have an oil supply hole on the exhaust side of the motor anyways, so you can keep all your lines tidy and short on the same side. Going from the oil filter adapter makes you have to route all the way around from the other side of the motor."
Miata,3bsp6p,joe_con,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:51:53 2015 UTC,"Ive drilled and tapped plenty of holes. I had to do so for my 1.8 swap in my 90 to fit the 1.6 TB and Flyin miata adapter.   The reason Id rather just run it from the oil filter is I dont have to drill or tap anything. If I dont I would have to drill and tap the iron block as well to get an oil feed. Its just easier to run them from the filter. Its true that its annoyingly on the other side of the block but oh well, I can just the lines in a tidy way either in front going just over the coolant neck, or by going behind. Probably in front if I end up doing the coolant reroute."
Miata,3bsp6p,carnvalOFoz,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:16:44 2015 UTC,"Really good video, I like how you laid it out in stages since it's your DD. Makes me feel more comfortable about buying the parts in stages. Would love to see the megasquirt video. I've been eyeing the DIYPNP since I have experience soldering amp kits. Is it worth going with the sequential upgrade on an NA6?  The only thing that freaks me out is tapping for the oil return. Greasing up the bits to keep the shavings to a minimum is a good tip."

Miata,3btwa3,BillBillerson,1 point,Sat Jul 4 15:31:24 2015 UTC,Why stretch such narrow tires on wheels that wide? I never understood the look of stretched tires.
Miata,3btwa3,cendrillon1978,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:05:01 2015 UTC,The rears are on 205s. Not stretched at all... The fronts are on the tires I bought the wheels with. I'm going to be running 205s all around in a few weeks when I put the fender flares on.
Miata,3btwa3,BillBillerson,1 point,Sat Jul 4 18:08:54 2015 UTC,"8"" wheels: 225's look right. 205's fit best on 7"" wheels. I know a lot of people run a little narrow for the look, but for me if I have the wheel for wider profile tires, I run them. I'm not all that fond of sidewalls that aren't perpendicular to the tread. It's an old racer wives tale that having sidewalls like \___/  handles better."
Miata,3btwa3,SoggyFrostedFlakes,1 point,Sat Jul 4 20:22:46 2015 UTC,Not true. Most racers are running 225 on 15x9 these days. The stretch creates preload in the tires. Emilio runs this setup which is enough to convince me.
Miata,3btwa3,FoFoJoe,1 point,Sun Jul 5 06:46:56 2015 UTC,"Stretched tires on a street car would typically mean a harsher ride and a higher likelihood to scuff your wheels/pull tire off rim. About the only body of people that race with stretched tires are drifters. What people gain in sidewall stiffness, they lose in overall grip so the end result is pretty much the same give or take. Running too wide a tire on a wheel also has negative effects.  I don't know who Emilio is, but when looking at entire classes of road race cars that generally run tires that are more or less have the same tread width as the rim width... I'm not going to question it too much (prime example being Spec Miata running 205/50-15's). I will say I know street tires have softer sidewalls than r-comp tires, but the supposed advantages of stretching tires wouldn't really matter aside from on the track anyway. There's no doubt in my mind 99% of people that do this, do it for the look alone."

And after switching back to a torsen it's really unpredictable and hard to enjoy the drive as much. I prefer a welded diff as my daily is also drifted.  TLDR; weld the diff, because it's fun, the wear and tear doesn't outweigh the positives. Just check bolts often."

If he is OK with severely reduced turn-in, difficulty turning at low speeds, and considering the entire driveline as a consumable part, go for it.  It's not worth the safety risk to me.

Miata,3bu1pg,69th,5,Thu Jul 2 03:47:28 2015 UTC,For this idea I would say try starting with a Toyota mr2. Mid engine RWD with an empty front clip for the electric motor bits.
Miata,3bu1pg,compaq727,1 point,Thu Jul 2 08:06:50 2015 UTC,/u/nopethefuckout94 got me thinking about this; would the FWD electric and the RWD gas need to have the same (or at least similar) torque/horsepower figures to make it any sort of worth doing?
Miata,3bu1pg,Nopethefuckout94,2,Thu Jul 2 15:12:25 2015 UTC,Well if you're talking about electric and gasoline motors working in unison not sequential like every other hybridized car. then you would be doing something that hasn't been done yet. In order to do so it seems quite simple but it's actually quite tedious you would have to create an ECU that not only controls all the gasoline motor functions but the electric motors functions as well. The whole bunch of regulations you need you have to dyno like eight times a day just to get power bands for both motors just to write out a map for the ECU it seems very very tedious and time consuming and costly for no apparent reason.  Now if you're wanting to just create a rear wheel drive Miata that's all electric that would be much more much much much more accomplishable. it would be something as simple as strip the car down to nothing but the frame and the body weld in a floor in the engine compartment so you can have all your batteries up in the front. You have to remake your trunk to accommodate for the large electric motors. And you can even run all the wires for the batteries to get to the motors through the transmission well and the drive shaft area. but alas you would still need to custom create an ECU to control it all. this is the thing that will cost you the most money and the most time and the most anger and frustration. I know people in my life who have turned old muscle cars into full electric full propane everything but gasoline. You need a nice ECU to control it all it's not as simple as you just plug it in and go. put your foot on the pedal and you're good to go. I mean yes you could get the brains from a fork lift and haggard the sum bitch in there to work but it won't be safe batteries can run too hot and explode motors won't work in unison but you can drive it.
Miata,3bu1pg,compaq727,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:46:40 2015 UTC,If you had a way to measure the torque and horsepower output of the gas engine you could limit the power the electric motor put out so it wouldn't go full torque on ya and you can use the gas engine to pretty much regulate the electric motor.
Miata,3bu1pg,Nopethefuckout94,2,Thu Jul 2 18:31:34 2015 UTC,Electric RWD is easier because FWD gasoline engines are self contained in the front. You can cut a front wheel drive car in half and put roller wheels from a dolly to allow the rear of it to swivel. Then electric is contained within the fuel cells running the length of the chassis and motors in the rear wheel area where a diff would be... It would be too redundant and difficult to make a front wheel drive electric and gasoline rear wheel. Doesn't mean that it hasn't already been done. it has quite recently in fact. I can't remember the name of the car but somebody recently invented a rear wheel drive gasoline engine that's a rear engine car that has electric motors in the front to make it electric front wheel drive. but it has no transmission to make it smaller so the electric motors is what you use to get the car up to speed then the gasoline motor takes over for everything else. So your idea is already been done just minus a transmission. Not being a dick just saying brother.   Edit: as an electric all wheel drive it exists as well. You just have a motor per axle or a motor per tire both of which exist already. The only thing that makes any sense at all as a gasoline replacement is hydrogen fuel cell.  Clean burning only emission is water.
Miata,3bu1pg,Astronom3r,1 point,Thu Jul 2 05:48:52 2015 UTC,"The Porsche 918 Spyder has a direct-drive electric motor in the front, and a 4.6L V8 paired with a 7 speed PDK dual clutch transmission, in addition to another electric motor driving the rear axles in parallel with the gas engine. It sounds crazy as hell and convoluted, but apparently it's good enough to be a hypercar that costs around $900,000. So. Probably not a feasible model to DIY. Sounds cool, though!  But yeah, I get what you're saying about redundancy with the whole FWD electric and gas RWD. Too difficult to get the two motors running at the same HP and torque, if not impossible. I think I should go to an automotive school... hmm."
Miata,3bu1pg,Astronom3r,2,Thu Jul 2 14:57:34 2015 UTC,"An electric RWD Miata would be stupidly fast.  Full torque from 0 rpm with no limited power band.  I'd imagine it would also be kind of boring without the engine noise, but maybe not."
Miata,3bu1pg,Astronom3r,1 point,Thu Jul 2 14:38:31 2015 UTC,"I can see how no engine noise would bother some people who like it, but honestly, in my book, I'd rather be all bite and no bark. It's more impressive to wreck the loudest car in the lot with the quietest one. Again, that's just, like, my opinion, man."

Miata,3bqafd,token5gtd,3,Wed Jul 1 10:42:34 2015 UTC,Flyin Miata is the only intake worth getting for this car.  Avoid INJEN like HIV.
Miata,3bqafd,thenewwazoo,1 point,Wed Jul 1 14:31:35 2015 UTC,I've been looking at all the FM stuff. Going to buy the intake in the next week or so
Miata,3bqafd,token5gtd,1 point,Thu Jul 2 12:09:14 2015 UTC,"I'm curious - why? I read some forum posts about the Injen part, and every one I read sounded like ""user error"" - upside-down AFMs, missing hoses, vacuum leaks, etc. Is there something I'm missing? I care quite a bit because the Injen is the only option CARB approved for an '05."
Miata,3bqafd,thenewwazoo,2,Fri Jul 3 20:13:00 2015 UTC,The inlet for the return hose from the blow off valve is placed close enough to the MAF that when the valve blows off it blows through the MAF causing a rich condition that will stall the car before it settles to idle.
Miata,3bqafd,token5gtd,2,Sat Jul 4 02:09:44 2015 UTC,*facepalm*  What a stupid design error. Thanks for the info!
Miata,3bqafd,Temenua,1 point,Sat Jul 4 05:21:32 2015 UTC,"Yea, i know. I bought my old MSM with an Injen intake already on it. If you press the clutch in after the engine has been in boost and just let the revs fall, it wouldn't even attempt to catch idle.  I would have to ""catch"" the revs with the gas pedal around 1200rpm and ease off to let it idle.. Even just revving the engine at idle would cause it to have a really hard time settling back on idle, would jump up and down, almost cutting off.  I tried everything I could to fix it, I ended up having to cut off and move the inlet farther up the pipe.  No problems after that, ran like it was supposed to."
Miata,3bqafd,ShadowBannedXexy,1 point,Sat Jul 4 16:02:59 2015 UTC,Too quiet or too restrictive? Did your car come with aftermarket already or is it stock intake still? Mine is still stock so I have nothing to compare it with and curious what you don't like about it specifically.

Miata,3bqafd,brancid92,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:24:10 2015 UTC,Rear end ratio?
Miata,3bqafd,quitit,1 point,Thu Jul 2 13:09:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the MSM comes stock with a 4.1:1 rear-end ratio, and the 6-speed transmission. Which isn't normally all that horrible, except when you consider that the MSM has a 6500 RPM redline, versus the N/A's 7000 RPM, and you get a car with a basically-useless 1st gear. Even moreso when you consider that such tight gearing kills the way the car builds boost - you spend so little time with your foot actually down that you don't build any boost until 3rd gear. It sucks.  The Australian cars shipped with a 3.63:1 rear-end ratio, which my car has. It's... amazing. First gear is useful, every gear is perfectly spread to drop you from HP peak to torque peak... it transforms the car. I would recommend that people do the rear end before any other mod. It's that good."

Oh and as a 6' guy I loved the adjustable steering wheel in the NC and the leg room I had.  In my NA my knees bump the bottom of the steering wheel at points but its not the end of the world.  I also enjoy only having to buy regular gasoline compared to premium in my NC.  And I am excited to be able to learn all the inner workings of my NA.

Stay far back from the car in front of you in heavy traffic so that if you are struck from behind and the car is pushed forward, you aren't smooshed between the car ahead of you and the one behind.   Also learn what snap oversteer is and don't go into a corner too fast. That can be scary in traffic, especially on a mountain road."
Miata,3brk4s,needaquickienow,1 point,Thu Jul 2 03:48:03 2015 UTC,Thanks for the advice.  Is snap oversteer a major problem with the third generation miatas? I would assume the brake tech in the car would help reduce the chances when driving on the road
Miata,3brk4s,Isami,3,Thu Jul 2 05:08:17 2015 UTC,"Deaths per million miles  The overall average is 79 deaths per million miles, and the 2001-2004 Miata is only 65. So, better than average, and much, much better than some of the worst cars. The newer cars have improved safety features, so should do even better.  I can only find crash test ratings for NBFL  The 2002 NBFL scored 4/5 on the EuroNCAP  The 2001 NBFL was awarded by the NHTSA: 4 stars on frontal driver, 5 stars on frontal passenger, 3 stars on side driver. Rollover wasn't tested."
Miata,3brk4s,Only498cc,2,Wed Jul 1 17:08:08 2015 UTC,"Could you explain the deaths per million miles figures you presented?  At 65 dpmm as you say the 01-04 miata has, I see 10 cars with 100,000 miles on the odometer having killed 65 people, and that doesn't make sense.  When googled, I found figures around 1.xx deaths per 100 million miles driven referenced by state.  I'm confused where you got your figures or what they mean.  Edit: deaths per 100 million miles driven"
Miata,3brk4s,Isami,1 point,Wed Jul 1 23:57:49 2015 UTC,"Those were actually stats from IIHS published in 2007 I found referenced, the source document is no longer available and a second reference to it quotes it as ""driver death rate per million registered vehicle years"". Seeing that the new document from 2012 uses that metric, I guess the first reference was wrong.  Mazda Miata NB: 66 overall, 29 multi-vehicle, 37 single-vehicle, 10 single-vehicle rollover.  Mazda Miata/MX-5 NC: 83 overall, 62 multi-vehicle, 21 single-vehicle, 21 single-vehicle rollover.  A possible reason for the increase is that more people are using it as a daily driver, and the demographic group is changing. It used to be a mid-40 onward toy car, now there are younger drivers.  Another set of data (FARS) indicates 9 deaths in 1990 Miatas in 2012, out of which 6 drivers were below 25."
Miata,3brk4s,cday119,1 point,Thu Jul 2 08:53:19 2015 UTC,I know that accident records are published by some government agency.  I remember looking at the NC deaths and being surprised that they were higher than the NB's.
Miata,3brk4s,nueroatypical,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:12:24 2015 UTC,"I drive my NA very defensively as it has no airbags and no door bars. I wouldn't say that I'm worried about getting into an accident, but I do my best to reduce the possibilities of it happening"
Miata,3brk4s,nick470,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:42:34 2015 UTC,"Treat it like a small, hard to see vehicle and you'll be fine. Trucks will want to merge into you, people wont see you passing them, etc. Just pay attention. Great thing about Miatas is that you're not likely to end up in a tree at 120mph like you might with a quicker car. The trade off is increased risk due to lack of visibility and smaller crumple zones. I don't feel unsafe in my car, but I am more conscious of whats going on around me than when I drive my Suburban."
Miata,3brk4s,Doctor_Sportello,3,Wed Jul 1 16:53:14 2015 UTC,"i can't cite the source, but there was a study that found that people drive more safely when they are in a car that makes them feel less safe, and people drive less safely when they are in a car that makes them feel more safe."
Miata,3brk4s,nick470,2,Wed Jul 1 19:11:18 2015 UTC,"I definitely believe it. At least with my Miata, there's the sense of being really connected to everything. You're low to the ground, you see how big all the other cars are, you feel how close the jersey barrier is. The limits are more tangible but at the same time there's a better sense of involvement in your own safety. My Suburban just feels numb and passive, like if something goes wrong, I'll step out of the car and survey the damage and that will be that. In the Miata, I feel like I play a more active role. It's more like how I ride a mountain bike or ski."
Miata,3brk4s,ShadowBannedXexy,2,Wed Jul 1 19:34:35 2015 UTC,"I drive mine like I ride a motorcycle, and have avoided quite a few accidents because of it. People definitely don't see you as well."
Miata,3brk4s,NotHyplon,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:27:26 2015 UTC,"They only tested it once for EuroNCAP and it got either 4\5 or 5\5 for driver\passenger safety. It was a 2005 model IIRC.  It only got a 1\5 for pedestrian safety, mainly because it would kneecap anyone that got in the way."

I might go 225's next time though since i'm probably not going to lower it and who doesn't love meaty fitment"

Complete respray.  Watanabe wheels (unless I can find some SRR Star Sharks)  Belt Line remove.  Turn signal intakes  Circlular side lights on the lower part of the front bumper.  The list definitely goes on, do NOT get me started on my perfect Roadster.  Edit for misreading the question: I assume you mean 1000.00 Euros and not 1000,00 euros.

Don't know about Euros, but I could rebuild every single part from scratch on my '93 NA, and probably gold plate most of them for $100,000 USD.  Or, I could buy a brand new ND, and upgrade everything to Ferrari performance levels.  Realistically though, last I knew there was a company in Florida that would take your Miata and around $10,000 and send you back a street legal race car. That included a stage 4 Turbo kit and everything that made it work, new clutch and diff, full suspension package, might even have been tires and wheels too."

She's been loosening up of late, and though I don't driver her much these days, she's got 150k ish. She could use new suspension bushings, and I'd probably do new sway bars and some aftermarket braces that I don't have, for the strut towers and maybe even the power plant frame. Last time I priced it out all that was about $400. Throw in another $500 or so for a roll bar, and she'd handle like she used to, maybe even better."

Miata,3bqdfw,schnurble,0,Fri Jul 3 04:03:24 2015 UTC,"First off, I would throw that style bar in the garbage and buy/install a quality roll bar. It's not so much that the style bar doesn't add safety, but that it is actually more dangerous. In a rollover or sufficiently high rear impact, it will very quickly and easily bend over and either entrap you or decapitate you.   Following that: suspension (sway bars, sport or track level coil overs), quality wheels and tires (I'm a fan of the BF Goodrich gForce COMP2 for my street tires, and I swear by Toyo Proxes RA1 for track time), performance brakes (Hawk HPS street, DTC-30 or -60 for track) and a fluid flush - maybe replace the master cylinder while you're there. Intake upgrades if applicable, seats if you want racing seats (and add 5/6 or harnesses then too). If you're in an NA6, maybe a 1.8L motor upgrade. Hardtop for those winter drives. Assuming it's a manual (and why wouldn't it be) clutch replacement, a Torsen diff if that's your thing."
Miata,3bqdfw,schnurble,1 point,Wed Jul 1 08:52:22 2015 UTC,"Those are some nice upgrades, but mostly for track right? Tho I'd like some better brakes since the stock brakes aren't that amazing in my opinion.. I'm really planning on going on track any time soon so most option aren't interesting for me.

Miata,3bqdfw,schnurble,1 point,Wed Jul 1 09:24:28 2015 UTC,"Most of that I have already done to my NA, which is my daily driver. I also take it to the track - I swap my COMP2's and HPS pads for RA1's and DTC-30's before I head to the track. Everything else I still recommend for a street car."

I lock the brakes, and I probably impacted at around 30mph.

My (non-miata) daily has over $1200 in extras on the car that wouldn't be covered normally as part of the value if the car was totaled so I have a policy that includes that.

Miata,3boyqv,SilverManGold,2,Tue Jun 30 23:38:46 2015 UTC,I bought the lights off of amazon and they are actually pretty sweet.

There's a wire you can run to an appropriate 12v power wire to make the lights come on automatically when your doors open etc but right now I have it wired to a toggle switch which is probably more handy.

While changing the clutch it is a good idea to change the bearings, inspect the slave cylinder, inspect the rear main seal, and if you can swing it, install a lightened flywheel with a slightly stronger clutch.  The Flyin Miata Happy Meal package is highly recommended."
Miata,3bqwer,NewbieTwo,1 point,Wed Jul 1 13:03:29 2015 UTC,"That might be a bit of reach for me, are there any other less costly alternatives, other than OEM? I don't mind it if it's absolutely paramount but I DD it, so I don't want to put in something that's more track-focused."
Miata,3bqwer,Ericjergs,2,Wed Jul 1 13:23:42 2015 UTC,"For the NA, a complete kit (minus the flywheel) is about 100 bucks from Arlington Mazda.  Its the exedy oem bundle.  Check out their website for the NB.  You'll have to navigate a few pages to find their online parts store."
Miata,3bqwer,the-crusher,2,Wed Jul 1 15:57:47 2015 UTC,I just bought this kit last week from Amazon with free shipping. It's an NB OEM replacement made by Exedy. Comes with the pilot and throwout bearing too.
Miata,3bqwer,the-crusher,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:08:32 2015 UTC,Did you install it yourself?
Miata,3bqwer,the-crusher,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:15:02 2015 UTC,Not yet. Doing it next week with the help of a friend.
Miata,3bqwer,bassali2e,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:22:18 2015 UTC,Is excedy a reputable brand? Is it ok to buy an OEM clutch? Also is a new flywheel necessary as well?
Miata,3bqwer,Arkapella,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:24:48 2015 UTC,"Exedy is a very well known brand and I've had good luck with them in the past. If this is just a daily driver then OEM is just fine. If you want to track it, then you might want to step up. As far as the flywheel, it isn't necessary to replace it usually. You can go with a lighter one if you want, but I personally don't like light flywheels on a daily driver. That's completely up to preference. If you keep the stock flywheel, it's generally recommended to have it resurfaced when changing the clutch, but not always absolutely necessary."
Miata,3bqwer,schnurble,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:20:06 2015 UTC,I have a flyin miata happy meal with the 10.3lb fly wheel on a turbo car. Still daily drivable.
Miata,3bqwer,Arkapella,3,Wed Jul 1 23:20:37 2015 UTC,"Other guy mentioned replacing the throw out bearing and slave cylinder when you do the clutch, seriously do those, especially the slave, it's a nightmare to do with the box/engine still in the car."

If I don't clean my wheels every few days the dust starts pitting the wheel finish.  TL;DR - Do the Hawk HP+ pads dust a lot?

Miata,3bpljy,cdude,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:42:30 2015 UTC,Know of any place to look at used fenders besides craigslist? I see some on eBay but they are about $300 more than just primed ones.
Miata,3bpljy,Cedge1,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:49:40 2015 UTC,What you see on ebay are probably pre-painted. Look for used. Craigslist and miata forums are the best. Just wait for people to part out. Be patient. With my luck every time i buy new parts I find it for sale on CL a few weeks later.

Miata,3bma95,CaptnBoots,2,Tue Jun 30 10:54:11 2015 UTC,"Straight up OEM Mazda hardtop, period.  If it's any other brand or model of hardtop (smoothline, light weight, carbonmiata) DO NOT BUY IT.  OEM hardtops do not lose their value, aftermarket hardtops aren't worth half as much no matter what condition they're in.  I bought my last hardtop for $100 over ten years ago and then sold it two years after I sold my '94 for $850.  Now they go for $900-$1200 depending on what part of the country you're in.    It's gotta be SMC (Sheet Molding Compound), not fiberglass aftermarket.  IIRC there is a place on the inside of the hardtop that has these three letters on it.  There are no other identifying marks on a Mazda OEM hardtop.  Extras would be the headliner and defroster with pigtail versions of the OEM hardtop.  If the side latch kit comes with it, that's an additional $40-$50 you'll save by not having to buy it.    I haven't read this in ages, but it's a great hardtop buying guide."
Miata,3bma95,murica_ftw,2,Tue Jun 30 15:15:17 2015 UTC,"+1 to this. The only definite way to tell it's an OEM top that I know of is to look on the passenger side rear glass for the ""Nippon"" stamp."
Miata,3bma95,jkpoteet,2,Tue Jun 30 20:11:34 2015 UTC,"My '91 ""B"" Package came with the optional OEM top; the window sticker, which I still have in mint condition, stated it was a $1200 option (1991 prices).  Fast forward 24 years, the top still looks in extremely well condition and have received offers for it that match the original price.  BE a cheapskate and get the OEM; when you're ready to sell it, guaranteed you'll get full purchase price back in your pocket."
Miata,3bma95,funnythebunny,1 point,Tue Jun 30 20:25:37 2015 UTC,"Echoing the others, the OEM's, if they aren't cracked and have good glass, are good to go. Don't settle for anything else. Seals aren't cheap, but easy to replace, latches may need to be changed depending on the years, but you should be able to find some and sell yours for the same price."

Miata,3biyha,somedrop,2,Mon Jun 29 18:18:25 2015 UTC,"If I remember right, the 6 speed actually has less of an overdrive than the 5 speed. You'd be better off finding a later rear end with a 4.10 or 3.90 gear in it. Good excuse to swap in a Torsen. You'd lose some acceleration though."

Earlier this week I found, and was wondering if you guys could tell me what you think and if it'd be worth my time?  I went to go take a look at it and everything runs, the owner still has all the dashboards and interior side panels etc, and would be willing to take off the roll cage for me. So assuming that I can put everything back together, i mean for 900 bucks is it worth it? (Also although not shown in the photos, the owner painted the rusted parts of the rocker at the moment, just to stop any further rust, but I'd be more inclined to have a go at fixing them myself)  I also took a look at the soft cover roof, its still in good shape with no rips or tears"
Miata,3bi77z,karmavorous,3,Mon Jun 29 12:52:18 2015 UTC,"With that much rust, I wouldn't take the roll bar out. That might be the only thing keeping the car from folding in half...  Seriously, I'm usually the person here who replies Meh, they all have rust, rust isn't the end of the world. But holy shit! That's a lot of rust!  And it is everywhere. It looks like he already ""fixed"" the front front of driver's side rocker.   See that thing on the stand in the foreground of this picture.   That thing is a tubing bender. And a pretty damn nice one. Probably cost him at least $800, depending on what size/radius dies he bought.  http://www.medfordtools.com/m32_bender.html  In order to do anything with that (like build a roll cage), you'll need that plus a tubing notcher which is another $250-$500 and a decent welder which is another $500-thousands of dollars.  So the seller seems to have a lot of nice fabrication tools and presumably some skills to match... and that person has given up on this car... This project might be above that person's skill level/dedication level...  I think I'd keep looking."

But that car has problems. Also, that rollcage looks like crap and isn't worth keeping most likely. The roof hoop/bar droops way too low and it looks like he has a tubing bender so I'd be wary of it being safe.  Honestly if you want something in that price range it'd be easier to get a NA with a blown engine and start from there as an engine swap would be 10x easier than fixing the body and paint on that thing."
Miata,3bi77z,Geteos,1 point,Mon Jun 29 18:08:44 2015 UTC,That's actually not super rusty compared to one I looked at in South Toronto back in May. The lady stored drove it year round and parked it outside with no cover. Every single panel was rusted and there was a beehive in one of the rusted rockers. She was asking $2700!!! I ran away from that one.  I think the rust is the least of your problems with that car though. But what's your budget and plans for the car? I've seen a couple decent NAs for around 4-6k. We're also in high season now so you're going to be paying a summer premium. Might have to wait til the NDs come out further into fall before you start to see better pricing as people start to unload their NA/NBs.
Miata,3bi77z,Geteos,1 point,Mon Jun 29 20:54:49 2015 UTC,"Realistically i'd be just driving around during the summer, as i'm going to be away for school for the next two years.  Budget wise, i'm (ideally) hoping for something around the $2000s range, but realistically I know I wouldn't be roping in much quality at that point  Seems like it might end up being the waiting game/saving up for me"
Miata,3bi77z,Geteos,1 point,Tue Jun 30 16:40:02 2015 UTC,$2000 is very slim pickings here in Ontario. If you want a relatively rust free car that will pass safety you will probably need to save up a few more k. It's a tougher market here. You either have daily drivers that are rusty now or summer only  cars that the owners are asking 6k+. Occasionally you'll find a middle ground but it's a waiting game.

I would suggest a 03-05 NB, not as expensive as an NC but still modern enough to feel like a newer car."

Miata,3bhq0d,murica_ftw,5,Mon Jun 29 09:02:05 2015 UTC,"I finally got around to installing some minor additions that I've purchased in the past month or so.  Here's the breakdown of what I installed yesterday and today:   Finally filled in the space under my single DIN Pioneer deck.  I used this generic pocket kit from Amazon.  Not too bad of a fit, but I had to shove some spacers underneath the pocket to get it to sit correctly.  It doesn't move around at all when driving, its got two tab snap ins on each end when you install it.   I also dropped in headrest speakers since my B package '90 didn't come with any.  These fit in nicely and I didn't have to cut anything.  I know they're a little pricey, but I like Polk speakers.  You can get half off if you go with the same size from another speaker brand on Amazon.   I also dropped in replacement horns as I've almost been sideswiped twice in the past two months by people that don't see me.  The sound/tone is a little ""air hornish,"" but they're not too loud (at least I don't think so)."
Miata,3bhq0d,jpesh1,1 point,Mon Jun 29 19:43:31 2015 UTC,Any tips or a guide that you used to install the headrest speakers?? I'm looking to do the same thing soon.
Miata,3bhq0d,murica_ftw,2,Wed Jul 1 04:40:49 2015 UTC,"If you go with 3.5'' speakers they should drop right in one side of the headrest mounts with a little finesse.  If you go with a larger speaker, say 5.25'' you'll definitely have to cut out a large portion of the middle foam section to drop it in.   There are two recessed areas in each headrest that would have held the plastic boxes for the OEM headrest speakers if they came with the car.  I didn't even have to mount them with screws, they stay in fine with just the foam holding them.  Run the wires down the back of the seat inside the vinyl, you can literally put your whole arm down the back of the seat in between the vinyl and the seat with the headrest cover unzipped all the way.  I then ran the wires underneath the tranny tunnel carpeting under the center console to the deck."
Miata,3bhq0d,GrahamTheftAuto,1 point,Wed Jul 1 15:53:30 2015 UTC,"How did you install those Supertones? Is there a write up somewhere? I bought them about a year ago and couldn't get them both to work (I have no clue how to wire up the relay that came with them), so I'm just running the low one for now."
Miata,3bhq0d,murica_ftw,1 point,Fri Jul 3 14:32:43 2015 UTC,"One went in the stock horn location, the other went in a similar location to the right of the stock horn mounting point inside the front radiator support area.  I bent one of the brackets on the other horn back and used a 1/4'' bolt and nut to mount it through one of the open holes.  I mounted the relay by the main fuse box in the engine, and ran a 12 gauge wire with a spade plug to the main tap on the fuse box.  I had to unscrew the fuse box to do this as it's impossible to get at the main tap lug without taking the whole thing out.  I'll send you a wiring instruction for the relay when I get back home in a couple of days so you can hook the second horn up.  This second supertone horn barely fit in that location, and this mounting setup definitely is not as loud compared to mounting the pair facing straight forward inside the lower radiator air opening."

I also want to get tranny, diff oil and brake fluid changed, will be bringing it to the shop, because I don't have the time, and I don't know how to do it, and have to bring it in for the brake fluid anyway.  I also think about lowering my car, but I don't know how I should do it, Eibach Springs are the cheapest, 160€ and I'm done for, but I always see no maybe don't do that. Are Coilovers reasonably comfortable? I mainly wanna do it for the car being (a bit) lower, more sporty drive would be cool, but not the main goal. I find my NB is reasonably comfortable on stock suspension, it shouldn't be much worse or I'll probably hate it. Any ideas?"
Miata,3bhq0d,SilverManGold,3,Tue Jun 30 07:37:23 2015 UTC,De-gooed my dash after my respray started peeling. Rewired my cigarette lighter splitter to be hardwired to the room fuse and added a 4 toggle switch panel to the dash for turning it and 3 accessories on and off. Routed wiring for my dashcam and GPS through the pillar panels. Installed led lighting for the floorboards behind dash and under seats. Installed a fire extinguisher in the passenger footwell. New revlimiter gauges and some 3 ohm resistors came in to turn off my airbag warning indicator so those are the next items to install.

The S2000 is a much better car than an NB. They were ~$15k more new, they are faster, they are much more comfortable and they are built to a much higher quality.  Miatas are more fun. NAs and NBs can be thrown around like nothing else I've ever driven.  If it were me, I'd see if the market corrects itself and CDM cars come down in price.

Do you have any idea about frame damage?"
Miata,3bgg0e,dpidcoe,1 point,Mon Jun 29 02:10:37 2015 UTC,"For frame damage I'd say just check the alignment of everything. All of the seams where the doors/hood/trunk close can be good indicators. Also if whoever you're buying it from has any record of getting the tires aligned, make sure none of the adjustments are maxed out.  I bought an NB with repaired frame damage and the owner was able to give me printouts of the last several alignments showing that the front wheels were fine. The only visible bit is where the hood is about 1/16th off center and it's just barely noticeable that gap is a tad wider on the passenger side compared to the drivers side. I don't care about the cosmetic stuff so it worked out well for me, shaved like 3k off the price of the car because the frame damage made it a salvage title."
Miata,3bgg0e,69th,1 point,Mon Jun 29 04:02:24 2015 UTC,"The drivers side gap between the hood and the fender was probably about twice the width of the same gap on the other side. i'm not sure if it was just badly repaired or if there is frame damage. I didn't notice any other gaps that looked abnormal. I'm not sure if they even took it anywhere to get the front end fixed, kind of looks like they just put a new hood and headlight on and called it good.   Maybe i'll check with the local tire place and see if they can check the alignment for me.  Thank you for the response!"

Miata,3bdhqt,BlitzWing1985,3,Sun Jun 28 05:19:02 2015 UTC,I'm running a Mishimoto rad with the stock fans and the JR kit. The only warning I can give is that if the rad is thinker then stock it will push the fans back just far enough that you will have to run the IAC hose a different way and more then likely put a bit of a kink in it. Nothing really troublesome but if you want to keep it looking neat you might have to put a 90 degree bend in that hose right after the dummy TB and/or get some slim fans.

Miata,3bdm3b,Zenopher,2,Sun Jun 28 10:46:12 2015 UTC,"I had an issue like this, it was the Crankshaft Angle Sensor for me. This is the sensor, next to the crankshaft with a slight offset to the driver side of the vehicle. The distance between the CAS and the little nubs on the crankshaft pulley is some measured amount...and for my car it was very sensitive, even though I was within the range, I had to be towards the larger gap end of the range.   Here is more information about this: http://forum.miata.net/vb/showpost.php?p=3180090&postcount=24  I had this issue a few months ago on my 1999. I did a water pump / timing belt on it. It would crank, but it wouldn't ""catch"". After I fiddled with this, it sounded like it would almost ""catch"". I then tried different distances with the gap, then found out the further away the sensor was from the pulley, it would catch. Tightened the bolt and 5k HARD miles later no problems."

Miata,3bc5bb,Zenie,1 point,Sun Jun 28 00:50:43 2015 UTC,While I'd sort of agree. Seats are a safety item and really you need to address if they're up to standards or not. I wouldn't rock a replica seat for track days that don't meet FIA standards.
Miata,3bc5bb,idownvotethenread,1 point,Tue Jun 30 05:53:55 2015 UTC,"Yes, but you would be surprised how many replicas do meet those same standards. They are generally made with the same process. There are a ton of seats from big names like Cobra, Corbeau, Sparco, Bride, and others that are not FIA approved. I don't know the specifics but I would imagine there are some logistics that are involved in getting that approval. This is why they do not. This is also represented by the fact that FIA seats from the same companies will cost you so much more"

NB seat bolstering is poor.  Bride reps are very nice quality, actually, they didn't last long in the mx5 because they lost too much seat travel with the roll/door bars.  Ditto the corbeaus.    Overall I'm happiest with the foam modded na6 seats with aftermarket leather reskin.  They aren't as light as racing buckets is the main drawback.

Miata,3begwi,tp99,3,Sun Jun 28 17:34:15 2015 UTC,"It can be done assuming you are a competent driver. I recommend snow tires, they'll help out a lot for traction. Some days you may turn into a snowplow and it'll be tough to drive. Also if you get the convertible make sure it seals well or you may get frost inside the windshield which is no fun. Sometimes a bag of sand in the trunk is helpful for more weight over the driven wheels and if you get stuck you can throw some under the tires for extra traction.   Overall, yes you can do it but I personally wouldn't. Get a hard top, snow tires and make sure the heat works if you do."

As a student id imagine it be a bit easier if  you're living on campus (see: walking to class instead of driving). If you do, I would say snow tires are an absolute must, and just be cautious/respect the conditions. The plus side to the miata is that it is pretty low power, so its easier to not get into as much trouble in the snow. For the most part you shouldn't have issues, every once in a while itlll be  tough if the snow is up past the bumper (there was one storm last year where I think this would have been the case)"

Miata,3begwi,EkkuZakku,1 point,Sun Jun 28 23:36:41 2015 UTC,"Take some driving courses to learn the handling of your car in bad conditions, and when the snow does come around, find a safe place to practice before you go driving around. Learn how to control slides. As long as you're careful enough, you shouldn't end up in a situation where you need that kind of car control, but better safe than sorry."

Also the tan top with white paint is growing on me. It's not as popular as black top with red and I like to go against the grain. I think I may try to get one in white with a tan top. Either that or a emerald green nb1. I really like dark green aswell.

The miata has 85k, and I like the white/tan combo the best of all the colors with the exception of the 93se black/red interior with bbs wheels. Took about 6 months to find a car with that color combo in the condition I wanted. Always liked dark green too, my first car was a 96 infiniti i30 with midnight emerald paint, the best color imo. Ill buy another one day"

I just hope I fit in the NA6, NA8 or NB1 I test drove my friends cousin NC3 and it was a good fit not smaller than my current car interior space wise. I just love the NA6 and NA8 that's where the soul of miata is at and the NB1 just looks really good. FYI 6'2 230lbs if you'd happen to have any insight that I will fit given my current car.   Edit: Cadillacs are not my speed and infinity I only like the g35 g37 I like small cars and mini trucks and crotch rockets those are my speed   Edit 2: yeah the red and black interior is super rare and amazing."

All cars are said to be in working condition and road legal. I am not expecting unrealistically perfect cars, but am wondering if this is a viable option or if i should really save up more for a better one. Thanks in advance for the help.  Edit: I also should mention I have good access to tools,and am in no hurry to get the car on the road, and can keep in in a garage to work on it without issues."
Miata,3bafkj,deltazap,1 point,Sat Jun 27 15:46:55 2015 UTC,"Disclaimer: This is all relative to these 4 cars based on the mileage, price, and what can be discerned from the photos.   As much as I love the green color, the price, the big fender dent and the mileage seems to be out of line from the others. Oh and the missing radio. Out for me.   The red 93 for €1650 seems high as well without having mileage information on it. (Side note: those wheels are real ugly!). If the mileage is significantly less than the others, it might be worth looking at. Otherwise I might pass.   Between the last two, it depends on how much mileage on the car matters. The one with 209k km for €1400 has something odd on the door, possibly missing paint? And the stripes don't match the other side, so has the fender been replaced or were the stripes just removed from one side?  The one for €1150 and 265k km has high miles, which may be of some concern, but that's €250 worth of parts from the next priced car. If it's in good running order, this might be a good option. The rust on the back panel would need to be taken care of ASAP. Since I'm in the market for a project car that I can spend time on, my perspective is that I might actually seriously consider this one for the price, but I also have a daily driver that won't leave me stranded."
Miata,3bafkj,Vrestos,1 point,Mon Jun 29 02:37:28 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the response. I too liked the green one, but the dent+mileage was very out of line (but gave some nice perspective). I personally would have gone with the 1150 (less time saving up more time working on it) but I will probably be buying in the near future once I see one that has great value (I'm not in too big of a rush), but are you saying that the miatas in the price range of 1200ish are still very capable cars that will last a while and run decent (not expecting anything unrealistic)?

Miata,3bafkj,zumora,1 point,Mon Jun 29 02:00:47 2015 UTC,"Would you guys buy a Miata with a Salvage/Rebuilt title? After searching around I managed to find pictures of it after the accident.  After the accident  How she sits now  Dosen't look the accident was that bad, only things i'm really worried about are the airbags and the frame.   After seeing the car in person the front end wasn't fixed very well, looks like they just threw a new hood and headlight on and called it a day and so most of the panel gaps are off. But hopefully with a little tinkering I could get them straight.   How do I know that the Airbags were fixed correctly?   Do you guys think the frame could have been bent from that accident?  If I were to buy it I would probably take it to a family friends body shop first to have him look at it.   The good things.   • 100% Stock. Well besides wheels I guess, even has the stock radio!  • 91k miles  •..... I cant really explain this one, I just like it for some reason.  It's at a very small used car place and is listed for $4k but there is now way i'm paying that. I thought about offering 2k and seeing what he says. What do you guys think?"
Miata,3bafkj,deltazap,1 point,Sat Jun 27 22:55:43 2015 UTC,I'm not really well versed in how much a salvage or rebuilt title affects the car. The airbags are just a module that they connect to the steering wheel harness and behind the dash. Not much to go wrong there. It doesn't look like there was any damage past the light. Frame should be easy to look at if your friend has a lift at their shop.   I doubt that they'll let it go for less than $2500-$3k unless it's been sitting there for a long time. Certainly have your friend look at it first and use that to your advantage. Worst thing that can happen is that you'll get laughed out of there and have some hurt pride.
Miata,3bafkj,zumora,1 point,Mon Jun 29 01:53:19 2015 UTC,"They've had it about a month I believe, So i'm half hopeful.   Do you have any idea if that sort of damage would have affected the frame? I have no idea about that sort of thing.  Thanks for your response!"
Miata,3bafkj,deltazap,1 point,Mon Jun 29 02:20:05 2015 UTC,"From a first glance, I don't think. That bra is holding everything together real nice and tight, so it's really hard to tell what actually happened. The engine bay shot makes it look like the collision was somewhat minor, but the airbags give the opposite opinion. The hit looks like it was high, probably missing the bumper and sparing the frame.   You're welcome. I saw there was a lot of questions and little responses in this thread."

Miata,3bafkj,deltazap,2,Mon Jun 29 02:32:41 2015 UTC,It is certainly a clean turn-key 96 Miata with an LSD. There's a reason he hasn't sold it in almost a month and a reason he won't be selling it in the next month. KBB is saying $4200 for excellent and I'll give it an extra $1000 for the LSD and the primo pampering he has done to it. No more than $5500-$6000. It seems like there's a lot of sentimental value he's added to this car.

Miata,3b6s3p,horny_zombie,3,Fri Jun 26 13:49:39 2015 UTC,What's wrong with it
Miata,3b6s3p,horny_zombie,8,Fri Jun 26 14:04:39 2015 UTC,"spent all last fall rebuilding the top end, all the signs and tests said head gasket or something up top was leaking oil into the cylinders. Had the head remachined and new parts, put it back together in december only find out oil was still pouring into the cylinders. So its the piston rings that are bad. So now i have to replace/machine/rebuild the bottom half of the engine. The bonus is once i do that though, I will have a completely new engine pretty much. But i needed a car so i bought a new one  It pissed me off because everything got out of wack because it over heated last summer. After replacing thermo, relay, fans it turns out it was one little wire connector that was preventing one of the fans from turning on and that caused the engine to over heat and warped parts of the internals. over $1K in damage was caused by $2.50 wire connector"
Miata,3b6s3p,Griffin-dork,2,Fri Jun 26 14:15:54 2015 UTC,That really sucks. Hopefully you'll get it working right. If not you can always do a ls1 swap
Miata,3b6s3p,Griffin-dork,4,Fri Jun 26 14:23:04 2015 UTC,"HA, it is so tempting right? i just double checked on the flying miata website to remind my self how much it cost. I was adding up the parts and stopped after it went over 10k. and that wasnt even including the engine"
Miata,3b6s3p,NEKKID_GRAHMAW,2,Fri Jun 26 14:31:48 2015 UTC,Could just do an engine swap. Way easier and cheaper than rebuilding it. Just find a healthy 100k mile engine and throw it im with some new gaskets and such.
Miata,3b6s3p,rfield91,2,Fri Jun 26 18:24:05 2015 UTC,yes but 99 (i think maybe 00s too) engines are extra expensive because they are coveted by racers (by what im told and can see in the prices) the the last engine before they had variable valve timing. So i was looking at the prices and new engine would be easily 1k+. Labor is not a big deal to me cuz i learn shit everytime. The other main reason if i keep the engine is i was planing on boaring out the cylinders i.e. MOAARRR POWER!!! which would be awesome
Miata,3b6s3p,SpacelyMoto,3,Fri Jun 26 19:52:33 2015 UTC,"True, 99 + 00 engines are the most coveted. You could always just swap to a VVT engine. Cars are expensive plain and simple. 1K for an engine really isnt that expensive either. So going with a 99 motor would be your easiest bet. Or put the time in to rebuild yours if you dont care about the extra time/work.   Oh and if you do bore it out, its going to need tuned. So say hello to $500+ on an ECU and tune to run that engine. No to mention you really wont gain much power at all just by boring it out a bit. To save yourself that hassle just have the cylinders honed/machined as little as possible to get a good cross hatch back on the cylinders and adjust for it with the rings.   I dont want to sound preachy but you dont seem to be super knowledgeable and hope some of what I said was helpful. I went through the same thing when I had to 1.8 swap my '90. The cost was the same for a 1.8 swap instead of just throwing a stock 1.6 in it. I wanted to go with a VVT motor hands down but then I would of had to go standalone ECU and I didnt want to get that deep. So I just got a 1.8 out of a 96 and ran with that since it was bolt in and easy and gave me a good bump in power (like 15% more power and 25% more torque over the stock 1.6)"
Miata,3b6s3p,AR-47,1 point,Fri Jun 26 20:50:54 2015 UTC,"yea im aware of some these things, i know that im not gonna get a ton of power. Pretty much all the stuff im doing are under the watchful eye of another gearhead, he knows an excellent machine shop too. He races them and is more so the enthusiast. I would be sounding totally different if i was doing this all on my own, probably would have gave up long ago, but im learning stuff. The hard part is top end is nearly perfect right now, its just the bottom half. We havent talked about it since last december before I gave in and just bought a new car. Im sure once we sit down and get started on it our plan might change. But thank you for the advice. Fixing the engine is a gift from him so it really just comes down to what he wants to do."

Miata,3b7o3z,AKADriver,3,Fri Jun 26 17:33:22 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Miatas are great daily drivers. Have you considered buying used? With such low mileage every day, I'd think an older model would be just as fun as a new one and a ton cheaper to drive and insure. Granted, you will need to do maintenance but parts are cheap and plentiful for even the earliest Miatas. I have a blast driving my 1992 on nice days, my commute is about 10 miles each way. I get tons of smiles and waves, too!  Spending $25k+ on a brand new car for such a short commute seems wasteful, that money can be better used being put toward retirement, student loans (if you have any), or house down payment. I'm being a little preachy but your excitement for a new car will wear off long before you're done paying for the car.   My poor weather car is a paid off 2010 Corolla and my wife's daily is a paid off 2006 Mazda6. Having no car payment is huge for us and we still have a blast driving my NA 😎"

And honestly, Miatas are RIDICULOUSLY easy to work on. If you have any interest in tinkering with a car, even with no experience, Miatas are a perfect car to go with. You can spend less than $4,000 on one and never have to worry about it, and even if you do, they're super simple cars. Personally, I'd try to find a 99/00 Miata just because they are a bit faster than the older ones and they can still have all the fancy pants luxury accouterments that the newer ones have.  DO IT.

We had great luck with her Mazda6 she bought 2-3 years used and she knows nothing about cars. My 1992 Miata is going great and I bought it when it was 23 years old. Her parents bought a 2-3 year old Mini Cooper and a BMW 328xi that have been great too. Saved tons of money that way, the first two years are crazy expensive from a depreciation point of view.   The new 2016s are incredible and it would be a blast to drive every day. Plenty of creature comforts but a blast to drive and likely bulletproof reliable."

Also, it should be getting pretty good gas mileage, even better than the older ones. I daily drive my NC 50 miles top down in Cleveland.

If the ND improves on the daily driving experience like then NC did, that 2016 will be a fantastic daily driver for your wife.  I daily drove an NA for a while, and moved to an NC in 2007. The extra cubby holes, different storage compartments, and Z-fold top were nice improvements.  And if you don't know, the NA/NB/NC/ND refer to the generations - first, second, third, and fourth respectively. The years for those are basically 1990-1997, 1999-2005 (no 1998 model years in the US), 2006-2015, and the ND starts with 2016."

Miata,3b7o3z,bmwnut,1 point,Sat Jun 27 14:39:30 2015 UTC,I dailied mine 150miles/day. It was fine. Not sure why any modern car wouldn't be fine for daily less than 10 miles. Good gas mileage and reliable.  For 10miles a day you could get away with a much less practical car. At that point gas mileage barely matters.  I personally would recommend a second car for actually hauling things and people.  Example - my gf has a FoFo for a daily and it can fit our two dogs for road trips or two/three more people plus coolers for tubing/beach trips or when our family is in town. We also have no kids to worry about hauling.

Miata,3b72mn,TheTownJoel,2,Fri Jun 26 15:39:16 2015 UTC,To get the 2.0 you'd have to move up to a 2006+ Miata.  So you'd be getting a newer car at a bare minimum.  I can't comment on how the two compare but I don't think anyone has ever complained about their Miata not being fun ;)

But he's quite expensive. http://mazda-speed.com/faq/audio/ wiring varies from each miata so here's a diagram. Also have a volt meter handy that can measure continuity just in case
Miata,3b7l0w,djchexxx,1 point,Fri Jun 26 21:41:19 2015 UTC,"Pull out old headunit. Connect wires via method of your choice to leads from new headunit. Soldering is not necessary, but will last longer. Never had a problem using butt connectors myself. Insert new head unit. Done.  The toughest part is determining which wire goes to which. Find the stock wiring diagram and pay close attention to the manual of your new headunit to make sure you get the right wires touching. I recommend testing it before you stuff everything back into the dash."

Miata's have a lot of little interior rattles and honestly the wind noise is pretty terrible going down the highway.

Granted it's 24 year old black plastic in Texas, so its probably time to replace that.  On a serious note though, these cars are amazing.

I forget the size/pitch of that bolt tbh.  Edit-search says 8-1.25 bolt.  Prolly like 3-4 inches. Hardware store like Lowes or whatever will be cheapest. Sometimes autozone has bolts but pricey and often force you to buy packs or aren't exactly what you want.

I'm guessing all NA/NB have the same/similar block/tensioner setup.  You will need a 12mm socket...too lazy to go open my hood.  Also...mine fell off once and the block actually was chilling on the subframe when I made it home. I was only about a mile from home so somehow I lucked out and didn't lose it. The bolt hit the bottom of the car just like you described so I thought I was hosed.   Still got the original tensioner block and bolt but had to buy a new pinch bolt for that block.

Miata,3b1cft,uncleawesome,-8,Thu Jun 25 10:34:51 2015 UTC,It's a love hate relationship between me and the person doing a review here in the video that you linked. I like how he's standing up for the NA but I mean I don't know. NA is a beautiful car. Feminine I don't see how people say that it's a feminine car.. What kinda women would own a two door convertable that she can't have her group of friends in. A fucking chevy jimmy would make more sense. I think its just a beautiful roadster that's two doors convertible or hard top depending on your preference. it's just an all around well built car. That horse power does not mean everything here when it comes to Miatas. Miata is one of those cars to where you don't need eight million horsepower to have a good time. I'm 21 years old I'm 6 foot 2 230 pounds and I love everything Miata. I don't see how anyone could ever hate on it. It's a subcompact car that does not have a whole lot of wheel horsepower and it is an absolute blast to drive granted I have only driven an automatic version because I have never driven stick so I'm scared to. I know how to drive stick I just never have because there's no reason for me drive standard transmission here in Southern California with the kind of traffic that I have. But I really want to get a standard transmission Miata and just drive the fucking thing and enjoy every single last horsepower that it possibly gives to the rear wheel. It's just one of those cars that will go down in history as the greatest car to ever exist and the car that everyone loves to hate. I just think that a riced out Miata is just the sexiest car to ever exist and I have driven just about everything under the Sun that is not stick shift. The only question that I have in this fucking life is when will people just accept that Miatas are absolutely amazing cars?
Miata,3b1cft,Nopethefuckout94,6,Thu Jun 25 09:09:57 2015 UTC,"The design is considered feminine because over time were told that aggressive design is masculine (angry headlights, muscle cars, sharp edges). So the smooth rounds and big eyed smile of the miata is feminine by default basically. At least thats my theory."
Miata,3b1cft,fcwolfey,-1,Thu Jun 25 10:31:21 2015 UTC,Honestly I think jeeps are more feminine because i always groups of girls in jeeps. Almost entire men in miatas.
Miata,3b1cft,Slammed_Droid,1 point,Thu Jun 25 13:16:09 2015 UTC,Can confirm that jeeps are more feminine than miatas. My mom drove a 1988 xj wrangler five speed until I was born in 94. which she sold to help cover the costs of my birth. To be honest nowadays agressive sharp edges and what not seem to attract women more then men. Here where I live I see women in supercharged challenges that are pink and then men are in Saturn Sky's and  BMW z3 and Pontiac Solstice you know very round smooth shapely cars that would be called as feminine but guys are owning the feminine cars. To me I think the long slender sleek lines of the body of a car reminds me very much to the shapely curves of a woman. So if a Miata is a woman and the Mustang is a man wouldn't you more much rather be in a woman as a man then in a man as a man this is a non homophobic statement here I'm just saying if you are confident in your sexuality then you should have no problem driving a feminine car and having absolutely no problem with it. but being harassed about driving a feminine car that's fucking irritating. I personally do not like the ND with aftermarket parts I think I could probably make the car look decent. but it would take changing out the headlights and doing a body kit and that's kind of defeats the whole point of fucking buying that car I might as well buy an NA save myself 20 grand and LS3 swap it.
Miata,3b1cft,Nopethefuckout94,3,Thu Jun 25 20:20:17 2015 UTC,"Most people/friends are telling me that I did this ""because the car is too feminine"". Even if that is partially true, I disagree. I wanted to add some character to my NA, and this certainly did that. Whenever I pass by people, 90 percent of the time they either give a huge smile or a thumbs up, and that makes my day.  By the way, for anyone that's interested, this took $9 and about 3 hours of work. Totally worth it."

Miata,3b3o4e,drdrewphoto,2,Thu Jun 25 18:29:20 2015 UTC,I also want to know how these are. I don't expect greatness but I wonder if they last more than a year or two.
Miata,3b3o4e,Slyons89,2,Thu Jun 25 21:45:15 2015 UTC,"I have the old Tein Basic setup (with a 5k rear spring instead of 6k, and rear sway bar removed) and Fat Cat Motorsport bumpstops and tophats. I got them used and I love them. Not much stiffer feeling than stock and they handle much better. Granted I don't know how they are with the 6k rear spring and the lack of FCM goodies, but I like them in my configuration. I've heard they oversteer like crazy with the 6k rear spring and the rear sway bar still attached. I went for one drive with my 7k/5k setup with my rear sway attached and it was still a bit too much oversteer for me to be comfortable so I took the rear sway off. It's great now."
Miata,3b3o4e,red_door,2,Thu Jun 25 22:21:11 2015 UTC,"I have these coilovers. They obviously aren't top of the line, but that's a pretty great price for what they are. Mine have held up. I bought them in 2012, crashed the car they were on, they sat on that car for a year, and I put them on my current car shortly after buying it last August. Ride was an improvement from the blown stock struts I had, but I wish the front spring rate was stiffer for autocross. I would also recommend getting an upgraded front sway bar; that made a huge difference."
Miata,3b3o4e,Viktor_Bielski,2,Thu Jun 25 22:57:22 2015 UTC,They'd be better then racelands but Basis really aren't that amazing. For the money spent you could build yourself something much nicer with koni yellows and some springs. I haven't owned them but I've ridden in cars with them and they felt stockish with height adjustment really. But if you're looking for some height adjustment and stockish feel then I can't imagine them a bad buy.

Miata,3b3o4e,Zenie,2,Thu Jun 25 23:19:18 2015 UTC,I would save it and get some $1000-$1200 suspension. If you're not in a rush to replace something broken that is. There's plenty of forum threads on budget suspension on miata.net and miataturbo.net. If you want the most bang for you're buck you're gonna need to do some research. No one is going to be able to recommend an end-all-be-all suspension package for a specific budget that suits all your needs. That or wait around and see if you can snatch something higher quality used for sale on forums.

Miata,3b38tg,red_door,1 point,Thu Jun 25 18:58:26 2015 UTC,Make sure you're car is cool if you're going to open that cap. Safety first. But make sure you have enough coolant.  You can burp air out of the lines by putting your car up on jack stands so the rad is the high point. Let the car run with the cap off and give the lines a bit of a squeeze. The idea is to force all the air out.
Miata,3b38tg,red_door,1 point,Thu Jun 25 18:24:19 2015 UTC,Thanks for the help and the warning. I carry 50/50 coolant in the trunk at all times! :)
Miata,3b38tg,red_door,1 point,Thu Jun 25 18:59:29 2015 UTC,"I'll be there Saturday! Look for the red '90 (number 535) with a goofy red helmet to match. I'll be honest, I would figure out that cooling issue first. Autox is a lot of short bursts of speed followed by either idling or killing the engine. Engines get very hot on warm days, so I'm sure your car (and your wallet) won't like that. One fan comes on when the car reaches a certain heat, then the other only comes on if the AC is on. Check that and replace the thermostat (It's a 20 minute job, do that regardless). If you're still wary of running it, feel free to ask me or any other participant for a ride along, most people are happy to oblige. They would much prefer it if your car didn't spill coolant all over the course and ruin everyone's day ;)  Edited to add: Be very careful about overheating. Overheating is one of the few things that kills a Miata engine. With an iron block and aluminum head, the metal warps at different rates when it overheats, causing the head and block to not be able to mate properly anymore, requiring replacement of head, block, or both.

So I'm trying to see If I can just figure it out myself. I don't think its the HLA. I think its whatever is supposed to send oil to the lifter/HLA/whatever the proper term is. Because when the car is nose down it goes away for a little while, or until I rev it high, or until I go up a hill. I think oil is sloshing from the back of the head to the front of the head, and then the HLA noise goes away. but when its level/ nose up I get HLA noise."

Oh and that top down feeling... mmmm...  You should drive an ST, though.... it has it's own brand of hooks that get under your skin like the Miata. I'd been cross shopping an NC, a BRZ/FRS, GTI, and the ST. All great cars with a variety of pros and cons. The ST was the only one that put a shit-eating grin on my face though when I got on it. It just /begs/ to be driven irresponsibly and it frankly is the best FWD I've ever had the pleasure of driving.

I have autocrossed the ST a couple times last summer, and took it to a track day at Blackhawk Farms earlier this year."
Miata,3az7z1,Griffin-dork,3,Thu Jun 25 00:50:26 2015 UTC,In looking forward to that RS coming out. Might just have to get one
Miata,3az7z1,we_are_temporary,2,Wed Jun 24 20:16:44 2015 UTC,"Focus is already my next car, but I'm going for the RS ;)"
Miata,3az7z1,ANAL_ANARCHY,1 point,Thu Jun 25 02:09:44 2015 UTC,What? My miata was the best car I ever drove through the winter. Just 4 snow tires and a little bit of skill and you have nothing to worry about. I never once got stuck or spun out or anything. Id rather have a miata in the snow than damn near anything else thats 2WD.
Miata,3az7z1,joshuad80,1 point,Wed Jun 24 20:13:50 2015 UTC,Miatas are a bit light for the snow. I had a g35 before my na and an e36 m3 before that. Both were far superior in the snow even without snow tires than my Miata with snow tires.
Miata,3az7z1,Dripp_e,1 point,Thu Jun 25 01:01:10 2015 UTC,"A bit light? They're one of the lightest car on the road. Really, you have to go out of your way to get a lighter car."
Miata,3az7z1,joshuad80,-2,Thu Jun 25 06:38:38 2015 UTC,"Forget the ford, get a 6, or at least a 3."
Miata,3az7z1,gumert,2,Thu Jun 25 01:28:41 2015 UTC,"Before I bought my Miata I was looking at speed3s. I prefer the ford, though."
Miata,3az7z1,GeckoDeLimon,1 point,Thu Jun 25 02:39:18 2015 UTC,"Well, the ST and Speed3 share very similar DNA. And actually, the Ecoboost 2.0 in my Ford is in the same family as the MZR 2.0 in the NC Miata to bring the relationship a bit closer to home. Seems lots of people forget how closely Ford and Mazda have worked over the decades. Ever looked at the airbag system in an NA? Straight Ford parts bin. Even has Ford part number stickers on the sensors. Engine in an Escort GT? Same B series 4 cyl as a Miata. Same goes for the Mercury Capri among others.   Besides, I'd much rather have the ST's interior over the Speed3."
Miata,3az7z1,GeckoDeLimon,2,Thu Jun 25 03:18:38 2015 UTC,"I can't argue with that.   I grew up in a Chevy family, so my old biases come out every now and then. I didn't realize ford and mazda has a close relationship."
Miata,3az7z1,GeckoDeLimon,1 point,Thu Jun 25 04:14:50 2015 UTC,Had*. Ford owned around 30% of Mazda at one point. Now they're slowly unwinding.
Miata,3az7z1,pro5,2,Thu Jun 25 20:07:13 2015 UTC,I'm strongly considering a Fiesta ST to park next to my NA. I never realized they were so inexpensive.   http://i.imgur.com/FL6IGsN.jpg
Miata,3az7z1,legacy642,2,Thu Jun 25 15:42:34 2015 UTC,"Well, the ""Why not both?"" is exactly what I'll be going for eventually. Have to recover from buying a house and having our second daughter sometime next week. My wife stays home with the girls, so even my relatively good single income doesn't go very far when trying to support a family and buy toys :)"
Miata,3az7z1,_cruster,2,Thu Jun 25 16:19:47 2015 UTC,"Been there, man. The toy budget will swing back in your direction eventually."
Miata,3az7z1,PJKenobi,2,Thu Jun 25 16:41:00 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah. And I really can't complain in the least. The blessing of even being able to afford to buy a house and new cars on a single income is not lost on me.   You should do more than consider that Fiesta :) I've only driven one once since I bought my Focus, but the Fiesta is dangerously close to being as good as the Miata, while keeping the majority of the practicality of the Focus. Based on other comments in this thread, it seems the FiST and the Miata is a popular combination anyway ;)"
Miata,3az7z1,legacy642,2,Thu Jun 25 16:54:17 2015 UTC,"A very good friend of mine has a FiST and we autocross together. He annoyed a whole lot of people last month when his H-stock car was putting up faster times than all but one of the STS Miatas.  0_o  I've driven his car, and really liked it. I want to get one more winter out of my current beater, so I'm thinking next spring. I can't do the Recaros, though. My shoulders simply don't fit. I'm not even a big guy."

Not a good start there, ford.  (before you say to buy one off the lot - I don't need one ASAP and I wanted a yellow one + moonroof + ST3 package which is apparently a unicorn in this area)"

Miata,3ayd5x,tomalapala,1 point,Wed Jun 24 17:28:59 2015 UTC,how does 17's change your driving experience? I'm still on 14s and considering getting larger tires next summer. just looking for your other's input! :)
Miata,3ayd5x,JDMdrvr,2,Wed Jun 24 19:39:57 2015 UTC,"I haven't driven on 17s, but I have to imagine they would add a ton of unsprung weight.  I had good luck with Enkei RPF1's, which at 15"" are only about 10 lbs - lighter than stock wheels.  Personally I think anything bigger than 15 looks kind of goofy on an NA, but I'm an old fuddy duddy."
Miata,3ayd5x,tomalapala,1 point,Wed Jun 24 20:02:46 2015 UTC,"^ The added weight was my concern. RPF1 15's seem to be the go-to choice for track days, and it's hard to find anything lighter. Thanks for your input!"
Miata,3ayd5x,MightyPenguin,1 point,Thu Jun 25 05:35:07 2015 UTC,"I bought this a week ago. I believe they're 17x7 or 17x8s, unsure of the offest but that's how I bought the car. the wheels had 12 year old 215/40/17s and they rode like rocks. I have 205/40/17 Falken 595 Evos now and while significantly smoother, it's still pretty harsh. I've only driven 2 miatas, this NA and an 05 mazdaspeed, so I really coudln't tell you how they ride without 17s.   after I get the paint done and the little 2""x3"" rust patch repaired, I'll proably trade down to 15x8 6ULs if only to make the car look a little less like a hot wheels haha"
Miata,3ayd5x,tomalapala,1 point,Wed Jun 24 20:05:36 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your input. 15's seem to be the way to go. And good god, I regret not waiting for a no rust Miata purchase.. :/"
Miata,3ayd5x,MightyPenguin,1 point,Thu Jun 25 05:36:50 2015 UTC,"If you want to go bigger get 15x8's, there is MUCH more tires to choose from and going too big just makes the car handle worse anyways. I lost a few pounds in unsprung weight just from the rubber going from 14x6's with 225/45/14s to 15x8(same weight as the stock 14x6's) with 205/50/15."

Miata,3ayd5x,jjhats,7,Wed Jun 24 14:34:13 2015 UTC,"No kidding - I'm a BMW guy and a Miata guy and I can't fathom who would think this is a good idea.    As a side note, when I had my '97 Miata a buddy of mine had a 4-cyl Z3 of the same vintage, and it was eye-opening just how different they were in character.  In fact, my dad later sold his M-Roadster for a mint '90 Miata.  Something magical about these little cars."
Miata,3ayd5x,Astronom3r,2,Wed Jun 24 14:43:17 2015 UTC,"Same for me, when I was looking for a car, it was between a Z3 and the Miata, but something about the Miata spoke to me(honestly I think it was the angry eyes though lol)"

Miata,3ayd5x,jjhats,-27,Wed Jun 24 16:21:55 2015 UTC,Honest question? Are you mentally challenged? Like can you please think for two seconds why this car would exist. Please put some thought into it. Still don't know? Well here goes maybe in some alternate universe people modified cars back in the late 90's maybe also in this alternate universe used miatas were 5-10k and new z3 were all the rage and cost 20-30k new. Maybe in this universe people modded miatas to look like 30k z3's. Im really sorry to sound condescending but I don't know how you immediately don't come to the same conclusion I did as it is very retarded  to imagine someone would do this today when yes both cars are worth the same on the used market. It just irks me to no end when people are extremely stupid like you have been. What's worse is the replies under you are just as dumb. Over on jalopnik they posted a porsche 944 with a chevy lt1 engine swap. The top comment was about how stupid it was when an LS engine is the same cost and a better engine to use. No shit Sherlock but maybe people swapped engines back in the early 90's when LS engines weren't introduced yet? I know crazy thought right.
Miata,3ayd5x,jjhats,11,Wed Jun 24 18:25:47 2015 UTC,The only thing that blows my mind is how much of an asshole you're being.

Miata,3ayd5x,jjhats,-10,Wed Jun 24 19:42:18 2015 UTC,I think it's funny how you all have such a negative disgust towards this car but if I call one of you out for being a Moron y'all get butthurt. It's a fucking $1200 miata what did you expect. Looking at the owner and tearing your hair out because a z3 cost 5k these days is so laughably dumb and shortsighted it's quote obvious this swap was done 15 years ago as the z3 isn't even relevant anymore. In short fuck y'all haters bmwz3miata4life ride or die mafuckaz

Miata,3b156j,johnshop,1 point,Thu Jun 25 03:15:51 2015 UTC,"Oh! It's something   Was your A/C on when you filmed this video? Do you notice how cyclical that noise is? It's starting and stopping with each re-engagement of your A/C compressor. Was it also a hot day outside when you filmed this?  Mine made that exact same noise with the A/C on and the engine running at idle in neutral. If your A/C was on while you filmed this, relax. What you're hearing is noise that's coming from inside the transmission and there's actually nothing wrong with it at all. I was searching online to find answers about this when I first noticed it and it turns out that it's just what they do. For other reasons, at one point I replaced my transmission with one that had 40,000 miles on it. It also made the noise.   Again, provided that it only makes this noise with the A/C on in idle while in neutral, all of your clutch and bearing work is just fine. These cars are kings of making strange sounds. Fortunately this one is completely benign. =)"

Miata,3awsfw,toadthenewsense,5,Wed Jun 24 03:53:48 2015 UTC,"It's gorgeous, how's body roll in the corners? A video I saw showed it leaning pretty hard..."
Miata,3awsfw,Virus64,13,Wed Jun 24 04:18:06 2015 UTC,The body roll was completely manageable and surprisingly minimal. The fact that they could get so little body roll with such a plush suspension setup baffles me. I hit a pothole that I commonly hit in my na Miata that is lowered with sport suspension and barely felt anything. had I been in my na my head would have hit the soft top
Miata,3awsfw,red_door,1 point,Wed Jun 24 04:33:06 2015 UTC,"Got my hands on the colour list (for Canada at least). Jet Black, Soul Red, Meteor Grey (OPs colour), Crystal White Pearl, Blue Reflex (a terrible colour for this car), and Ceramic Metallic."
Miata,3awsfw,MrMiketheEngineer,16,Wed Jun 24 19:30:27 2015 UTC,1. How is the steering? 2. How is the power? 3. How does it handle? 4. Are the seats comfortable? 5. Does it feel like a Miata?
Miata,3awsfw,fredrodgers,50,Wed Jun 24 03:20:52 2015 UTC,"Electric power steering- I know a lot of people favor the traditional hydraulic power steering but I was a huge fan of this steering rack. It was heavier than you would expect from a modern car, especially at a stoplight. It was inspiring though, you could feel the road through the steering wheel. It felt planted, yet you could feel how light the car was while cornering. It's kind of hard to explain Power was excellent. (I'm coming from a sloppy misfiring 1.8 NA) the power delivery was unbelievably smooth and still exciting. a lot of times when I drive modern cars the acceleration is very boring and quiet.  I was surprised at the amount of torque that it had at lower rpms. The top end is powerful as well and it doesn't have that surging peaky feeling that you would get with the earlier Miatas. When doing a full throttle run 1st through 4th gear I was able to get the tires to squeal when shifting into 2nd. I did notice though that with this car it did not make me want to drive like a juvenile but rather enjoy spirited driving. During the drive I never felt that it needed more power or tourist in any gear or an attendee rpm The handling of the car was absolutely sublime. The car did not inspire reckless driving but rather spirited driving. there ways never a time when driving at where I felt like I would need more power or more grip which is surprising for a stock car . This car was able to bring back the sensations and emotions that I felt the first time I ever drove an NA Miata.  At the end of the drive through the canyon it did cross my mind with the car would be like if it had a set of wider stickier tires and stiffer lower suspension. Hopefully as the car is released we will come find that it is an excellent platform for modification and tuning The seats are one of the first things that I noticed when I first looked into the cockpit of the car. upon sitting down I was welcomed by a familiar secure feeling in the seats. I felt like even driving the car at the limits you would be secure in the stock seats.  I really feel like they hit the nail on the head with the seat and the driving position it was the perfect combination of comfort for longer drives and security at high G forces . seriously. I'm 6 foot 2 and I weigh 225 pounds so I am NOT a small person. I was able to fit in the car comfortably with the top up or down and the wind blocker that comes stock on the car was still effective even at my height. I was told by the people at Mazda that they lowered the seats 1 or 2 inches to give you a lower center of gravity and I think it is working Yes it absolutely does feel like a Miata. the first thing I did when getting into the car was simulate rolling through the gears and I was invited to do so by one of the most snappy and precise manual transmissions that I have ever driven. the way that the seats hug you and you kind of fall into place when getting into the car makes it feel exactly like a Miata. Just like the NA Miata the cockpit is small but you do not feel cramped. You feel snug and secure. there is less room although they do have some nice handy features like  detachable cup holders and a few compartments. it does not feel soft nor heavy, it feels precise and focused. you can really tell that they were greatly inspired by the magic of the NA Miata and I don't think they could have done a better job emulating the NA Miata, especially with the amount of safety equipment that is required for the car to be sold in the United States"

Miata,3awsfw,SiMonster78,1 point,Wed Jun 24 08:02:49 2015 UTC,"didn't stop some people from hating on the NC when it came out, and they grew to love it. And some people loved it from the start. People have lots of opinions about Miatas and they have never been perfect right at the start... they almost always need a suspension upgrade, and there is always something to improve by version 2/2.5. It happened with the NA, NB and NC and I'm sure it will with the ND also!"

Miata,3awsfw,tyllsny,0,Wed Jun 24 17:37:36 2015 UTC,Yea that's a good point. OP is basically comparing a 20+ year old car to one that's on the bleeding edge miata development.
Miata,3awsfw,Zadnak,12,Wed Jun 24 17:40:27 2015 UTC,"One more thing that I forgot to mention is that the car looks much better in person than it does in the photos. for some reason they were unable to capture certain angles on the back of the car with a camera. Also when the car is being driven nearby and you see it it is very eye catching and looks badass. Some purists may be offended because the Miata kinda always looked girly but I am a huge fan of the looks. This Miata is going to be big, I can tell."
Miata,3awsfw,cream-of-cow,3,Wed Jun 24 03:59:02 2015 UTC,Wow I hope I can see one in this colour soon then!! As the pic looks amazing in that grey...  I've only seen a white one though nice and neat.
Miata,3awsfw,Griffin-dork,2,Wed Jun 24 04:50:40 2015 UTC,"yea, the miata was never aggressive looking or anything like that. thats what i think brought it its charm, non-threatening, but a beast if you didn't know what it is capable of."
Miata,3awsfw,NC_310,6,Wed Jun 24 04:20:57 2015 UTC,Does the top go up and down as easy as the NC?
Miata,3awsfw,Griffin-dork,15,Wed Jun 24 03:24:44 2015 UTC,The Engineering that they did on the soft top was actually one of the things I was most impressed by in this car. essentially what you do is pull on a small lever that is easy to reach right behind your right shoulder when you are in the driving position. When you pull on this lever it pops the preloaded pop up far enough to where you can reach it without twisting your spine or your arm. when the top is pulled down to the front of the windshield frame it locks into place and you pull the lever down with ease . I would rather have this system than any other top system. it is faster I imagine then most electronic tops which are heavy and prone to failure. if I get the chance I will post the photos I took of the top latching mechanism
Miata,3awsfw,Griffin-dork,3,Wed Jun 24 03:53:17 2015 UTC,The preloading makes it takes about half the amount of force as the NC top.
Miata,3awsfw,dajohnnyboy,5,Wed Jun 24 11:45:50 2015 UTC,"Absolutely.  Once again, the Miata's strongest competition is other Miatas.  :)"

Miata,3awsfw,dick-faggotson,2,Wed Jun 24 11:48:53 2015 UTC,"Looks like it's got the same corner-tuck configuration as the NC, I hope it doesn't cause similar stress-tearing issues. I was lucky enough that Mazda replaced mine under warranty when it began to tear, but I know a lot of NC owners had ongoing problems with it."
Miata,3awsfw,froggy1000,6,Wed Jun 24 12:15:21 2015 UTC,When these start rolling into dealerships I am going to have to go drive one. I dont own anything newer than a '91 so it may be time for me to get a new car to drive to work everyday. New miata may be a good idea. Wait until one pops up used at a carsense or something for 5k under new. with under 10k miles on it. I just need to have a hardtop.
Miata,3awsfw,letsgofightdragons,1 point,Wed Jun 24 13:51:42 2015 UTC,"Who knows, maybe they'll release a coupe/fastback model?"
Miata,3awsfw,Zenie,1 point,Wed Jun 24 14:39:31 2015 UTC,"That won't ever happen. The core idea of the miata is that it's a roadster. There ""compromise"" is offering a hardtop. Thats it. The had hardtop coupe concepts for NAs and NBs. Only one of each ever made and they both look AMAZING. Real shame they never made them I love everything about the miata except that it's a convertible. I hate that part. And honestly with the new one. I'd most likely buy and FRS over a miata. I just dont want to deal with a boxer engine. So do I deal with a convertible or a boxer engine? Hmmmm. Both suck massively."
Miata,3awsfw,Boxereight6,2,Wed Jun 24 13:54:11 2015 UTC,They actually did release a coupe of the NB in Japan...  NB Roadster Coupe
Miata,3awsfw,dajohnnyboy,2,Wed Jun 24 23:12:18 2015 UTC,I am well aware. But that was a special edition with very very few made. Im talking about a mass produced one. Where you can just go to the dealer and pick one up just like any other miata.
Miata,3awsfw,kmartisnice,4,Thu Jun 25 02:45:50 2015 UTC,On turn in under hard braking can you feel in the steering the front wheel traction?  How was the throttle mapping?
Miata,3awsfw,Virus64,6,Fri Jun 26 18:36:33 2015 UTC,"To be honest I did not even turn off the traction control nor did I give it a good wringing in the corners.  I was too afraid of becoming the first person to crash and nd Miata. I can comment on the throttle response though, which was incredibly quick. I was worried about the electronic throttle at first but not after driving it, the throttle response feels very natural.  The power comes on very smoothly with adequate torque in the low end and it does not have a peqky power curve"
Miata,3awsfw,clipsound,1 point,Fri Jun 26 20:54:43 2015 UTC,"Awesome that's great to hear on the throttle.  I can't wait to give one a spin, I will drive to the dealer in an NA, I will let you know my thoughts if I get a chance to push things further."
Miata,3awsfw,clipsound,4,Wed Jun 24 08:38:39 2015 UTC,Have you driven an FR-S/BRZ?  I was impressed with the steering in the BRZ I drove and would be curious how this compares.

I think it is definitely worth it. I had a fantastic driving experience in it and I was only able to drive it for about an hour."
Miata,3awsfw,sunlit_lightbulb,4,Wed Jun 24 23:11:45 2015 UTC,Which trim was it? Was it impressive enough that you seriously consider buying one?

Miata,3azfx1,Jonathan924,1 point,Wed Jun 24 19:55:25 2015 UTC,^ mine started ticking after I changed the oil with 3 quarts (low). Filled her up with another half-quart and tick disappeared. (76k mileage)
Miata,3azfx1,tomalapala,3,Thu Jun 25 16:55:04 2015 UTC,"Your oil is low and/or it needs an oil change.   I use rotella t-6 synthetic 5w-40 in mine. Ticks only happen if it's sitting hot, or hasn't been run for a few days. It seems to perform in this regard better than mobile 1. Way cheaper too.   Rotella t6 is a diesel oil but it works. Used it in all my sport bikes and cars, both old and modern. Search it up and you'll see a lot of people run it.   Make sure you get the blue container though. And make sure it's synthetic."

Like, WAY more. 10w-30 synthetic is fine, 0W-40 shouldn't be necessary. Cleaning the hydraulic lash adjusters is pretty simple, you will be amazed at the digusting, thick, black oil that will come out of them. I disassembled mine and soaked them in carb cleaner for about a minute each, then re-assembled. MAKE SURE THEY GO BACK INTO THE HOLES THEY CAME OUT OF. Use an empty box from a dozen of eggs to keep track.   Finally, don't be disappointed if you cannot completely get rid of the tick, there will always be some at cold starts or if you are low on oil."

Miata,3azfx1,munchbard,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:44:33 2015 UTC,"Early NAs had Hydraulic Lash Adjusters (HLA), basically adjustable valve lifter, that fill with oil and adjust the gap beween the cam and lifter.  The problem lies with dirty oil entering and getting trapped in the HLA.   A simple oil change wont help. The Miata.net community has had good results from what they call the ""2Twisty Flush"" Basically, you drain your oil, replace it with tranny fluid a a cheap filter, let it idle for an hour and then drain, flush with a gallon of kerosene; oce the engine has had a chance to evaporate, fill the engine with Rotella T6 and a good quality oil filter. I've done this to my '91 and IT WORKS.  # oil changes later and still not ticking.  *2TWISTY Overdrive Member # 11301  This ""knocking"" sounds more like the classic Miata HLA tick.  Your car has hydraulic lifters and sometimes you can't get oil into them fast enough for them to stay totally inflated, so they tick.  When you check the oil, make sure the car has sat for a few minutes NOT RUNNING. For an accurate measure, I like to wait about 5-10 minutes.  There are a number of ""solutions"" to the HLA clatter, and every one of them involves changing your oil.  My favorite is to do 2 oil changes.  On the first, put a cheap filter in the car and put 1 qt of really thick oil and 3 quarts of auto tranny fluid (yes, ATF) in the engine and run it for about an hour.  Drain that out. While the drain plug is off, run about a gallon of kerosene through the engine to flush it out good.  Then, put your good Mazda OEM, Mobil1, or Purolator (NOT FRAM!) oil filter on the car and fill with your favorite oil (dino or synth)  Others will just tell you to adjust the viscocity of the oil.  I have found the adjusting the viscocity only moves the problem to one end or the other. If you go thicker to address the hot tick, you're more likely to cold tick. If you go thinner to address cold tick, you're more likely to hit tick.  I believe that the lifters tick because the hole in them that allows the oil in is too small, and over time this hole closes up a little due to varnishing of the oil and other deposits.  The strong detergents in the ATF help to dissolve these varnishes, restoring these holes to closer to their original size.  I have no proof of this, but in my experience, my method works for longer than the others I've seen. I usually get 3-4 oil changes at 3-5000 miles before ticking comes back.  The ticking won't really hurt anything, we're talking about thousandths of an inch here, but it sure is annoying to have your nice pretty car clacking at the stoplights...*"
Miata,3ayth4,EML0210,5,Wed Jun 24 16:23:04 2015 UTC,I think it will cause a mild price drop in used NCs.  I don't think they'll have a lot of backlog of new ones.
Miata,3ayth4,EntroperZero,2,Wed Jun 24 16:58:19 2015 UTC,We might see a small increase in used PRHT NCs until the ND fills that gap.
Miata,3ayth4,PsychonautMIA,3,Thu Jun 25 06:44:25 2015 UTC,"I believe that it will on the used market, but by the time the ND gets here most of the NCs will be gone to not really create any smoking deals on leftover new vehicles.   Some folks will say that savvy shoppers would wait to buy an NC until they get to drive an ND, but I feel that many buyers of convertibles are buying on emotion and may not actually be all that savvy to begin with. After all, look how many Chrysler Sebrings and Pontiac Solstice's have been sold. Not that an NC is anything like them, but it just proves that there probably buyers out there for new NCs.   As for used NCs, as one version comes out to replace the prior version it initially causes a price drop, but then ultimately it ends up stabilizing the depreciation of the older car. My reasoning for this is that the new car is quite expensive and the older NCs are going to be the only inexpensive way to get into a newer reliable Miata. Opinions of the NC itself are also changing quite rapidly as the older cars (2006 - 2008) are getting to an affordable price range. I'll add that the recent price increases in clean early Miatas are making both NBs and NCs somewhat more attractive also."

Miata,3ayth4,fprintf,1 point,Wed Jun 24 21:01:21 2015 UTC,To be fair the only car that had a top that was as easy to operate as ours was my fiat spider.  Lol I was simply saying  that the gm roadsters atleast had some great attributes.  The Sebring is a giant hunk of midlife crisis /old fart shit.  That car has no qualities to speak of.

Miata,3ayth4,Nopethefuckout94,1 point,Thu Jun 25 00:15:53 2015 UTC,I think the increased excitement in miatas will overshadow any price drop caused by people offloading their cars for new ones. Lots of people will fall in love with the new miata and then realize they cant afford it and go used.  That's what happened to me.
Miata,3ayth4,itsorange,1 point,Thu Jun 25 05:12:12 2015 UTC,There just weren't that many new NCs on dealer lots to begin with. There won't be any excess inventory to sell. You might find an autotragic that they couldn't get rid of.

Miata,3axdri,letsgofightdragons,4,Wed Jun 24 09:17:45 2015 UTC,I've always wondered - why can style bars be traps? (I'm new to the Miata scene and wanna get into it)
Miata,3axdri,MitchiJZA80,7,Wed Jun 24 14:38:02 2015 UTC,"Summarized from /u/Griffin-dork below:   in the event of an actual rollover, style bars like this, that only bolt onto the top of the seat belt ""towers"" (just 1 bolt on each side usually) will bent or snap forward acting like a mouse/rat trap where the occupants are the mice/rats. Most likely snapping your neck, or at best beating the hell out of you. You are way better off not having ANY bar back there instead of a ""style bar"" like this one. Thats all they are. They offer the LOOK of a rollbar without any of the protection and are much, much cheaper."

Miata,3axdri,letsgofightdragons,1 point,Wed Jun 24 15:08:09 2015 UTC,A roll bar is still beneficial just for street use. Just make sure you PROPERLY pad it so your noggin doesnt crack open in the event of getting rear ended.
Miata,3axdri,Griffin-dork,1 point,Wed Jun 24 15:46:59 2015 UTC,"I hope by padding you mean a helmet, because I doubt those foam noodle pads provide much further protection than from bumping your head while human-tetrising your body into a cage."
Miata,3axdri,letsgofightdragons,1 point,Wed Jun 24 16:06:11 2015 UTC,"No, I actually meant the padding. The padding is designed to protect a helmet-less skull from being broken by the bar. Your head will hurt, and you might have a small concussion if hit really hard. But there are many instances of people, in miatas specifically, having that padding protect them from bad injuries when being rear ended.   Remember its a lot more than just a pool noodle. Its actually very firm rubber padding that is meant to absorb and disperse as much of the impact as possible."

Miata,3axdri,Griffin-dork,2,Wed Jun 24 14:28:03 2015 UTC,"The guy below explained it a little. Basically in the event of an actual rollover, style bars like this, that only bolt onto the top of the seat belt ""towers"" (just 1 bolt on each side usually) will bent or snap forward acting like a mouse/rat trap where the occupants are the mice/rats. Most likely snapping your neck, or at best beating the hell out of you. You are way better off not having ANY bar back there instead of a ""style bar"" like this one. Thats all they are. They offer the LOOK of a rollbar without any of the protection and are much, much cheaper.   The first thing many people do to a miata upon purchase is install a hard dog roll bar. Understandably so. It wasnt the first thing I did but I am glad I did it. It improves rigidity noticeably, adds a lot of safety/protections, and imo looks really good."
Miata,3axdri,thefirebuilds,2,Wed Jun 24 14:37:19 2015 UTC,sit on your trunk and kick at that seat belt roll bar.  I guarantee you can get it to fold over.  Let alone in a rollover.
Miata,3axdri,Griffin-dork,1 point,Wed Jun 24 15:15:34 2015 UTC,"Yeah, probably."
Miata,3axdri,thefirebuilds,1 point,Wed Jun 24 15:42:14 2015 UTC,"I looked at it closer and yes, I probably could! I do rather like how it looks though... Hmmm maybe a replacement with a more proper bar is in order in the future!"

Miata,3axdri,TheHast,1 point,Wed Jun 24 21:16:21 2015 UTC,"Just as another POV, I installed a HD bar in my last Miata, and I won't be doing so in my next one.  I know there are a ton of threads about it out there and no one right answer, but:  - I'm not convinced that the padding will help in a serious rear-end collision (imagine your head hitting a lightly padded steel bar at 45 mph), and even as a short dude (5'8"") my head could easily touch the bar. - The odds of a rollover crash are really low - a quick check of FARS data shows 5 fatal crashes in the entire US in Miatas (all years) in 2013, compared with 19 non-rollover fatal crashes.  I don't have the time to do a GES search at the moment to find estimates of non-fatal crashes, but it's easily done, and I'd guess that discrepancy is greater still due to the severity of rollover vs. nonrollover crashes. - Made putting the top up a serious pain from the driver's seat. - Impeded rear view - On the plus side, it noticeably improved stiffness, but I had no other stiffness mods like FM frame rails.  Edit: Apparently I can't format line breaks; apologies."

Miata,3auoou,Sean5294,1 point,Tue Jun 23 19:40:30 2015 UTC,"Nice to know, but why do you advise new shocks ? Mine seemed ok last time I checked."
Miata,3auoou,karmavorous,4,Tue Jun 23 20:31:47 2015 UTC,"Stiffer spring require more damping - that's what the shock does - it doesn't really absorb shock, it dampens oscillation. It stops the car from bouncing after going over a bump.  Shocks dampen oscillation by turning the energy of the bump into heat inside the shock.   Stiffer than stock lowering springs on stock type shocks will generate more heat inside the shock - more heat than they are designed to deal with. This will make them go out faster.  They also just won't really do the job because they're not tuned for the spring rate - so the car will bounce (feels like floating in a boat on a rough river - bobbing up and down) after bumps. And after a little while (maybe a few thousands miles) the heat will start to break down components inside the shock and they'll just get softer and softer (meaning the ride gets bouncier and bouncier) until they're just not doing anything any more.  Many many many people complain about some brands of aftermarket springs complaining that they ride horrible, but often that's just because they put them on stock shocks.  Adjustable shocks are adjustable so that you can dial them if for your given setup - certain springs, certain weight of the car, certain tires/wheels/unsprung weight.  And many times a high performance adjustable shock set to the right setting will be far more comfortable than lowering springs on stock shocks - even though you might think that soft shocks are gonna be soft and compliant and smooth, too soft of shocks makes the suspension ride worse."
Miata,3auoou,Mr_Noobert,2,Tue Jun 23 21:02:51 2015 UTC,"So, I just came back from the garage and I will be putting new everything. They wanted to charge me 380€ for the installation of the springs, but they had an offer for four new shocks with installation for 400€.  No need to say that the spring install is now free :)  Thanks for the advise !"
Miata,3auoou,cdude,1 point,Thu Jun 25 16:51:53 2015 UTC,"If you have the tools and time you should tackle the job yourself.

Saving money, learning, improving my baby? Cant beat that."
Miata,3auoou,Sean5294,3,Wed Jun 24 04:57:10 2015 UTC,You plan on using stock shocks? The recommendation with newer lower springs is that you need better shocks to control them.

Is there anything in the rules to stop someone from doing those accusations -- like requiring the accuser to pay for the engine rebuild on any vehicle found to be within the rules?   I don't feel sorry for anyone whose engine failed tech, even for a small infraction. At this point the rules are only for the top competitors anyway because no one is using stock engines any longer, at least not anywhere near the front. So the whole Spec Miata class has really become a place for the haves and have-nots, which is the way racing has always been or become. Never has there been a race series where money wasn't a factor, where the guys with the most investment ended up doing the best... no race series in my knowledge has ever been a ""run what you bought off craigslist"", even LeMons."

But if a motor is tore down by SCCA tech there is no cost to other competitors, this is considered part of the cost to racing.  It's just that if 90 cars come out and only 10 keep getting their motors popped it's frustrating.  In one case a friend didn't have his head returned by the SCCA until after his next race.   I don't feel sorry for anyone whose engine failed tech, even for a small infraction.   nor me, I do feel sorry for people that get their motor popped and are forced to reassemble it over a judgment call by non competitors.   At this point the rules are only for the top competitors anyway    it's well understood the worst offenders are midpack, they assume they'll never get caught.   no one is using stock engines any longer,   all motors are stock.   the whole Spec Miata class has really become a place for the haves and have-nots,   my team had the top finishing na6 at the sprints and the 2nd highest placing na8.  We're definitely squarely in the ""have nots"".  Spec Miata is the cheapest place to wheel to wheel race.  My typical weekend is cheaper than my dad's LeMons weekends.

Miata,3au1m5,n4ggs,5,Tue Jun 23 17:19:40 2015 UTC,Rules is rules. People pushed a little too far and got caught.   No advantage is too small to be significant.
Miata,3au1m5,n4ggs,-3,Tue Jun 23 15:10:40 2015 UTC,Not entirely.  The plunge cut discussion starts from the fact that you don't leave sharp edges inside a motor's combustion chamber.  Else they get red hot and predetonate.
Miata,3au1m5,n4ggs,3,Tue Jun 23 15:19:15 2015 UTC,"First, that is an advantage. Secondly, most didn't break the rules in their quest to get a properly running race motor.  Fuck em. Read the rules more carefully next time."
Miata,3au1m5,Mr_Noobert,-6,Tue Jun 23 19:25:14 2015 UTC,"No rule was violated.   The throat area of the port consists of the 90 degree angle at the very bottom of the cast steel valve seat as it transitions to the aluminum casting below. It is permitted to plunge cut the throats in order to correct for core shift that is commonly found in many cylinder heads. This cut cannot extend further than the specified number below from the bottom of the ferrous valve seat. There can be no tooling or machine marks in the head below this point. The area under the seat where the plunge cut ends and the casting resumes cannot be blended by hand, machined, or chemically processed to create a smooth transition. The 90 degree bend at the bottom of the valve seat and the aluminum directly below it will be measured with a gauge and must conform to the maximum diameters and depths listed below.   ""In rule “3” builders are specifically allowed to plunge cut the heads to allow for the correction of core shift. There is no definition of “plunge” or 'plunge cut” in the GCR. There is no procedure spelled out in rule “3” or for the plunge cut. The plunge cut is solely defined as a cut that does not extend more than 12 mm below the valve seat and no wider than 1.178”, with no tool marks evident below 12 mm. It is VERY important to state that NONE of the competitors protested violated this rule in any way. The rule does not say “how” to do this plunge procedure or what tools may be used. The rule does not specify the “plunge” procedure to be in one step or many, one tool or many. Builders are free to do whatever they wish within the specified dimensions. It does not say you must use cutter “x: with a specified “x” degree radius or no radius at all. Reading “3” and the complete SM ruleset, a competitor will be 100% compliant if they chose to do the entire plunge cut by hand with a porting tool, Dremel or even a pocket knife as long as they stayed within these dimensions. Literally any manner of removing the material would be compliant. The profile of the cut is also unrestricted by the rule, so a multiple step procedure with multiple tools, a radius cut, a straight cut, an elliptical cut and anything else you could think of would be compliant as long as it was within the specified diameter and not to exceed 12 mm in depth. Again, none of the heads violated this rule.  Even using the strictest interpretation of “3”, If a machinist were to use a straight cutter and machine a cut straight down on the same plane(which is also not specified by the rule) as the factory Mazda plunge cut, material is being removed the short turn radius. By definition, this directly contradicts and violates “4” as “4” CLEARLY states and what we are being found in violation.  “ No material may be removed or added from the short turn radius in the port”  Any larger bored hole definitely removes material from the short side radius, as it is impossible not to do so. This is extremely important to state as this point alone makes EVERY cylinder head ever built for competition SM non-compliant.""  Further:  ""It should be noted that the top three finishers all passed an extremely thorough and invasive post-race engine teardown to the crankshaft, along with a transmission and differential teardown. Even with heads on an inspection stand, and valves removed, it took 7 inspectors over 5 hours to make the subjective determination that the cuts and deburring operation did not conform to Rule “4” based solely on visual inspection. Conflicting Rule “3” was not taken into account as it was not specifically cited in the protest."""
Miata,3au1m5,red_door,3,Tue Jun 23 19:28:27 2015 UTC,Nobody's gonna read all that. It's amature racing that some people treat like life and death competition.   It doesn't matter.

Its worth it to hold out for something, even if you have to stash away some cash for a while. You don't want a 20 year old car that will crap out on you, unless of course its not your daily driver and you can afford to have it off the road for a while.

I'm looking for a commuter that I can also autox (not looking to be competitive, just to learn). How necessary is a compression check before pulling the trigger?"
Miata,3as7fx,shutterlindsey,3,Tue Jun 23 02:18:13 2015 UTC,"Don't really worry about compression, if you don't have a gauge handy, you'll get a good idea of how the engine is doing without it. I'd worry most about any rubber components around the car.  Control arm bushings are hard to feel for if you've never driven on fresh ones, but ball joint boots (tierod ends, front upper control arms, and front lower control arms), steering rack boots, hoses (heater and fuel filter), engine mounts, and tires are all things you should observe when trying to buy any car because of their wear rates. Shock boots aren't very valuable imo, but you might be able to lower the price a bit if they're bad.  Listen for grinding when accelerating and engine braking, particularly in 3rd and 4th gear (usually signifies a drivetrain misalignment i.e. bad engine mounts and diff mounts). Also feel for any notchy shifts or crunches when changing gears.  Finally, check fluids and drive it out on the highway to feel the alignment.  FINALLY don't be afraid to ask the owner to lift his car so you can see underneath. It's difficult to get a clean look under a stock Miata much less a lowered one."
Miata,3as7fx,shutterlindsey,2,Tue Jun 23 03:42:22 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply! Dude's GF's brother is a mechanic who works from home. Hoping he'll do a compression check for free tomorrow when I meet them (guy said he'll try). Hoping the brother can jack it up too so I can peek at all those things. Maintenance record seems like no timing belt/waterpump has been done (maybe ever), so hoping to talk down for those."
Miata,3as7fx,Astronom3r,2,Tue Jun 23 04:45:09 2015 UTC,"Also look at the coolant to see if it's brown-ish. Rust in the coolant generally denotes an old water pump that needs to be replaced (it will still work, but it does give you a rough estimate of age as far as ""old"" and ""new enough""  Don't forget to do this before test driving the car and bringing it to temperature :)"

Miata,3as7fx,laranzu,2,Tue Jun 23 17:30:20 2015 UTC,Records on these cars can be spotty since so many people work on them themselves. Timing belts are easy to do on Miata's and it very well could have been replaced by a PO. Not too big a deal though since these aren't interference engines and usually things don't break if the belt goes.

Miata,3aqm7n,miatainkansas,1 point,Mon Jun 22 18:42:37 2015 UTC,"$550 is the price of the local importer. They are run and are warranties for 90 days. Also, the wobble got so bad that it actually destroyed the keyway on the crank. Only option for that engine is a new crankshaft."

I pulled mine apart and did Tue loctite fix with all new parts and idk if it is even working.. When I first started running it afterwards it was pretty smooth. But after auto crossing it has a wobble again. The wobble has gotten any worse in the last month so idk if its actually holding. I want to buy a new 1.6 but I want a 92-93 one with the big nose crank. They are just very difficult to find.. I too am interested in JDM engines.

When test driving it if it makes any bumping noises from the roof near the front don't worry as this is normal and easily fixed with a little electrician's tape.

There aren't ball joints back there so that's out  Something else that comes to mind...check the wheel and tire...check for bulges in the tire itself, and see if you threw a weight, could well be that the wheel is out of round/out of balance"
Miata,3aoyh3,TAFte,1 point,Wed Jun 24 13:37:35 2015 UTC,"Its not so much side to side movement. Its more as though the left and right suspension are oscillating up and down out of phase with each other. The vibration doesn't affect the steering or front wheels, just the rear. It happens primarily at highway speed, but can happen on surface streets when I hit rougher pavement.  The alignment and wheel balance are a good place to start for sure."

I personally don't think I'd go the Skippy route but the program looks like it's very good and it's definitely a bonus in that they provide the cars, so you get some Miata track car seat time. My wife and I both went the Driving Concepts route to get our race license and we both enjoyed it. Of course, you're providing your own car with Driving Concepts. And they assume you've done track events before, which it appears Skip Barber does not.   Either way, if it gets people out on track I'm all for it. :-)"

Miata,3amh31,MrStarlight,5,Sun Jun 21 22:49:36 2015 UTC,"Like cheating never happens in any other class? Please... SM is the most affordable way to go wheel to wheel racing beyond karts. Spending $7-10k on a built engine seems steep, but that's still cheap compared to many other classes. Hell, shifter kart engines get up there for a little single cylinder. Any other class you think doesn't have cheating is either some expensive class with sealed engines or classes that are much less raced. There's a fraction of the participation in Spec E30 or 944 and there's no way there's not some grey area stuff going on there either. When a class gets as big as SM yeah there are more people pushing what's legal, because there are just more people. If someone wants to race regionally and get in the top quarter, they don't need a $25k car."

Honestly when I hear someone jump on some ""that class cheats"" bandwagon, I just assume they've used that excuse to explain why they haven't gotten into racing, or why they can't succeed in the class. Cheating happens, but the majority of people are trying to do what they can to be as fast as legally possible."

Miata,3amh31,thefirebuilds,1 point,Tue Jun 23 15:45:23 2015 UTC,"There will always be some that try to cheat in everything in life. In racing those people fit into like 3 buckets: people who don't know they're cheating via ignorance, people who live in the grey area of the rules (many times because they think everyone else is too), and people who flat out disregard the rules if they can get away with it. The first 2 groups can be reduced by having as clear of rules as possible. The last comes down to having an organization that actively seeks to check people and cars. Unfortunately the top of the class gets scrutinized the most (even more so at a national level) and the bottom guys generally don't. There's more cheating in the mid-field where people look at the top finishers, think they cheated to get there because ""hey I'm a good driver, what separates me from them"" and then start doing what they think they can get away with. Again, not all do this, but a few do.   I'm still optimistic about SM since I think it's a great class and NASA and SCCA are doing a decent job of keeping people in line with the rules. I think it's a goal to get people 100% honest, but you have to be realistic."

Since you already have an ECU, don't worry about that.  You also need exhaust headers and a cat from the 1.8.  Everything after that cat should be the same between engines.  Check out the guides on FM's website."

Message me if you feel like taking a  shot with a mystery head. That said, the previous owner didn't seem to know much, so I'll need to check the head to see if it's actually from a 1.6.

I replaced and re-aligned almost everything. Even swapped in a different PPF. Sorry I don't have an answer, I was never able to resolve it, but it never hurt anything either. The car was wrecked with 212k miles. It had been grinding for at least 70k before it's death.  My current 1.8 doesn't have that grinding noise, but I think it still has the original clutch and everything. PPF was probably never moved."

Miata,3al36k,Nopethefuckout94,0,Tue Jun 23 04:56:55 2015 UTC,There should also be speakers on the deck near the convertable top. Idk if this is so on the NB or not I can't remember. Also its super simple just be careful when taking your door panels off there are plastic clips that hold them on that are like $80 a piece and you need all of them. Buy a tool to help you. The speakers should be held on with four screws. Then pull the speaker out gently and disconnect the plugs. Plug the new ones in and put the screws in and reassemble everything else. Oh also be careful about the door locks near the handles you will want to disconnect that as well. If you don't feel confident just go to a speaker shop. Look it up on Google. There is always one near you. Also you can search on you tube how to install speakers in door panels. It is really simple the hardest part is not breaking those clips.

I think it depends a bit on the year.  When I pulled my hose it just fell apart into ~10 pieces.  I was in a pinch, and went and grabbed a standard length of hose.  I've had no issues.  I think early models had a built in check valve and later models did not."

I took it to my local auto parts store and got a hose, but it seems that there is some kind of filter of some sort in the original. Will it be OK to use the regular pvc like hose without the built in filter?"
Miata,3ak0a4,azza10,3,Sat Jun 20 23:18:57 2015 UTC,It's a check valve built in and no you shouldn't use a pipe without it. It's part of the PCV system.

The NA did not change much from the na6 to the na8 so I would think that there is a good chance of being able to swap all of the r134 out of an na8 car into a 1.6. May have to fab some tabs here and there. The problem would be finding a donor car that you know is not leaky.  Just my thoughts as I have a working r12 system but the compressor is making a bad bearing type noise lately....so I have been considering the same job.

Turns out the bolt that goes through the power steering pump and the supercharger support bracket decided to quit his job. Just need to grab a new nut and it'll be good to go.

There's a bump I go over to get in my spot (wooden beam is there for some reason) so I'm not ruling out the engine bay area. It's got to be mine because I have my own spot I park every day away from the road. Thinking maybe brake caliper or even diff mount? I've had a strange rattle at speed for a few weeks, thinking it's related to this being loose/falling out.   If anybody recognizes it you'd probably save me some time so thanks in advance.  Edit - I'm not dead. It was just a bolt for the power steering pump/supercharger support bracket. No problems caused luckily, just need to get a new nut."

If it's not that, it might be a suspension bolt,  check both a arms  front and rear and wherever it's out of,  make sure to check tightness on all the other bolts around it too.

The best places I've found to mount it would be the panel below and to the left of the glove compartment (doesn't interfere with it at all) and the cover for the gauge cluster.

Miata,3ahugf,69th,1 point,Sun Jun 21 13:09:43 2015 UTC,"Seems worth it. I'd check it out, for sure. I'd probably even pay that price. Roll bar should be, well, not gold and shiny, but that's just my opinion. Other than that, I'd say just inspect it, or have it inspected by a mechanic, and if it all checks out, hop on.   Oh, and ask about timing belt/water pump changes. It probably needs them now if they haven't been done."

So this is basically paying $600 for a set of gen 2 6UL.  http://sfbay.craigslist.org/sfc/pts/5052479445.html  This feels kinda expensive to me since the gen 4 is $159 per wheel. What do you think?

Miata,3ahugf,dr2fish,1 point,Wed Jun 24 08:21:35 2015 UTC,"I'd balk at the salvage title, but only because I've had a bad experience with a bad reconstruction in the past.  Then again, 10 years on any bad repairs ought to be showing up (in my case, rust below bondo).  The price looks awesome otherwise if it checks out, but the market out there might be different from podunkville VA where I live.

Regarding soft tops, transfer the whole thing, frame and all. There's a shitload of bolts running along a strip of thick plastic / vinyl along the bottom edge (aka the ""rain rail""). They can all be accessed by pulling back the carpet of the rear deck. The actual frame itself attaches at the hinge via three bolts on each side. Pull off the plastic panels just behind each door sill, and you'll see the bolts. With an extra pair of hands, I bet you could swap them in about an hour.

Miata,3aenwp,Jonathan924,1 point,Fri Jun 19 23:19:23 2015 UTC,Maybe a rear mounted turbo? I really liked the one I saw on 1320videos in the sleeper miata
Miata,3aenwp,Nopethefuckout94,1 point,Tue Jun 23 16:03:05 2015 UTC,"Well for the roads he drives on a super charger would be the best. Super chargers are effective throughout the entire power band but, mostly in the low end ie... 1st 2nd and partially 3rd. Where as a turbo is effective only once it's spools up ie... late 3rd 4th 5th (6th doesn't mean anything for power cars 6th is for better fuel economy due to the higher ratio of the gears) but, more power can be made from a turbo......   Conclusion: mountains roads = super charger... Race track = turbo charger......   Now with this said he still might throw a turbo at it. He just won't ever use it 9/10 unless he starts doing autocross where a turbo is mandatory to place anything besides last or drift events. I just think a blower sticking out of the hood would be awesome on a miata."

Miata,3ahauk,dominatorkawabunga,2,Sat Jun 20 04:23:50 2015 UTC,I'm literally about to go buy a 91 miata as my first car this weekend. As long as you can borrow a parents car if you need the extra space I say go for the miata.
Miata,3ahauk,dreamflowing,1 point,Sat Jun 20 05:03:01 2015 UTC,There should be no problem with that then. I'll follow suit. Looking at a 93 in red. Just need to figure the little things out before pulling the trigger. Have fun with the top down!
Miata,3ahauk,dreamflowing,2,Sat Jun 20 05:06:55 2015 UTC,"You too! I'm looking at a 91 special edition. And just so you know insurance is surprisingly cheap for these. At least with my company. I have no clue how your height will work. I'm an extremely short guy at 5' 3"""

Miata,3agd5r,Nopethefuckout94,1 point,Fri Jun 19 23:55:47 2015 UTC,A little tlc I'd say so. I'm guessing 3500 is a good price point but the low miles will bring it up to 4000 easy. Try and get it for as close to 4000 as possible.
Miata,3agd5r,Nopethefuckout94,1 point,Fri Jun 19 23:38:20 2015 UTC,Base price they want is $6500 on the website. Doubt it's that much
Miata,3agd5r,69th,1 point,Fri Jun 19 23:55:34 2015 UTC,"Ehhh I would try and talk them down. Say it has low miles but, the engine is leaking fluids and the paint is nice but the overall car is in rough shape. Ask them what's the lowest they will take and offer 200 to 400 lower if they say 5500. If they say 6500 I'd pass. It will need repairs so stress that to them. They will sell it reluctantly but, they will. Try and get it for as close to 4000 as possible.   Edit: worth the time is up to you. How much do you value your time?"

Miata,3agd5r,djchexxx,1 point,Sat Jun 20 01:52:29 2015 UTC,Oh well shit just save up man. Walk into a dealership and pick any miata once you have two grand to put down. You don't have to get an NA unless you want it. Which in that case just keep saving and grab a good one off craigslist. Also remember to always take any car to a mechanic and ask for a prepurchase inspection. It'll save you from buying a lemon... Like I did. Its not a miata though. I too am saving for one. Got four hundee and climbing steadily. In six months I'll be joining the club. I learned my lesson about car buying is all. So anytime I get the chance I remind people to do the prepurchase inspection.   Edit: I have had my pos Saturn for a year. I recently fell in love with all things miata.

Miata,3ag36l,Iappreciatecats,3,Fri Jun 19 21:21:58 2015 UTC,Try craigslist in Georgia and cali. I live in cali and there is a good number of them here just not at dealers.
Miata,3ag36l,Nopethefuckout94,3,Fri Jun 19 23:36:43 2015 UTC,"wow, I cannot believe I didn't even think about that! That is extremely embarrassing.  I feel like such a ditz now, so much so I will probably delete this post.  Thank you!!!!!"
Miata,3ag36l,Nopethefuckout94,3,Sat Jun 20 00:28:50 2015 UTC,Now don't beat yourself up over it. If you get one from cali as long as it's not from the coast you won't have any rust to deal with but they will be dirty if you get it from like Westminster or Palmdale. You know the more deserte areas of cali. I'm certain it snows in Georgia so you will have rust from salt. Just browse the Almighty Craig's list well. If you don't see a picture from an angle you want contact the seller and request it. The people who are shady will not give that picture up. The people who are nice should have all the photos you want/need available. Also remember to take the car to a mechanic and ask for a pre purchase inspection. It could save you from buying a lemon. A $40 to $100 inspection or over paying for a car with a leaky head gasket or worse with disabled idiot lights.

It could be something as simple as a low refrigerant charge, or it could be something electrical or mechanical.   The A/C in my 2000 NB worked flawlessly for 12 years before enough of the refrigerant charge finally bled off to effect function. I recharged it and it worked fine again until this summer. I just recharged it again...added one pound of refrigerant.  Now, remember:recharging the A/C system did not repair the A/C system...the refrigerant is still going somewhere...and that has to be located and corrected.   I hope this helps!"

Not really there for engine swaps, turbo/supercharging, track day (bro), or how to get hellaflush. Maybe some autocross info for stock/street class but that's about it. All the aftermarket mod stuff info can be found on your local Facebook group page, but for DIY maintenance articles and stuff like that, m.net has what I need."

The VT is a brand new model, so every day there were a lot of interesting new threads, information, mods, etc.  Miata.net seems old and tired in comparison, which totally makes sense when you keep in mind that there's not a whole lot of new information on a 25+ year old model car.  There's all the new ND discussion, but it's nothing really groundbreaking.    I agree that there is still a lot of useful information that can essentially be archived on miata.net (i.e. The Garage sections on miata.net).  I do miss being able to check the new posts every day and expecting some exciting discussions like I did on my last forum though."

Miata,3aehox,Electric_Rectum,1 point,Fri Jun 19 19:20:47 2015 UTC,"I liked it.  It was fun, unique, and fairly quick with its 1.6L direct injection turbo charged engine.  The handling was pretty awful though.  Even with new tires, a strut bar, and a rear torsion bar, the handling still wasn't great.  The back end dances around on even the smallest bumps.    Plus, there have been several reports of VT owners' engines popping (google LSPI) and Hyundai being a bit flaky when it came to warrantied repairs and replacements.  That's when I took the opportunity to trade in my VT for the Miata.    What the Miata lacks in raw power, it more than makes up for in fun and handling.  Plus, since the Miata is naturally aspirated, there's no turbo lag.  So at low RPMs, the Miata feels like it has more torque and power than the Veloster Turbo."
Miata,3aehox,k3m4c3,1 point,Sat Jun 20 04:37:39 2015 UTC,"Interesting. Good styling though. My inlaws continually buy Hyundai SUVs and I cringe when I have to drive them. Something about Hyundai is they just can't get the steering feel right. It's over boosted and they wander all over the road. The latest Santa Fe they bought is the worst of all of them.   You can't deny their styling and included options though, I think both are top notch given the price. Love the way they look."

Miata,3aeakr,awyissmfbreadcrumb,1 point,Sun Jun 21 03:00:25 2015 UTC,"Almost anything aftermarket is going to knock down the value of your car. It's much easier to sell a stock car for someone else to modify to their tastes rather than hoping that the person you are trying to sell your miata to has the exact same taste in aftermarket parts as you do. If you have to permanently modify the trunk lid to attach the spoiler, they will have to replace it to go back to stock, or have bondo and paint work done. Even a stick-on lip spoiler can ruin the paint when you go to remove it.  I have an OEM style wing spoiler on my NA. It was installed by the previous owner. I don't hate it, it isn't offensive. I would have preferred a  lip spoiler though, and the existing one is drilled through the trunklid."

Miata,3aeakr,flyercomet,2,Fri Jun 19 17:02:00 2015 UTC,Lip spoilers are the most tasteful kind for the trunk for sure. The front spoiler (I call it a splitter) is also great but I think they only came on the R package Miatas. Lots of people install cheap replicas like the Garage Vary one. I never bothered because I would constantly be afraid of ripping it off. I drive my car hard and don't have time for slowing way down to go over uneven/raised streets or driveways.

Miata,3afozq,BrokenNumbers,2,Fri Jun 19 19:29:09 2015 UTC,"Miatas do not use torque to yield head bolts.You can reuse the head bolts, though it isn't too expensive to just buy yourself a new set. You can get some great ARP head studs for pretty cheap considering the peace of mind it will give you.  Getting a torque wrench is a must. You CANNOT just go for ""hand tight"" or ""that'll do"" with the depth that you're diving into with this. Head bolts and everything that has to do with the head needs to be torqued to spec. You can find that information pretty readily on the internet."
Miata,3afozq,MadSceve,1 point,Fri Jun 19 20:58:43 2015 UTC,"this, and I have ARP studs in mine which are fantastic and I HIGHLY recommend if you're gonna be in there again"
Miata,3afozq,sw201444,1 point,Sun Jun 21 23:04:24 2015 UTC,"Well, you are going to need a new head gasket and new head bolts since the old head bolts are torque to yeild (they stretch at torque spec) and are not reusable.   This is also not a weekend job. You need to send the head to a machine shop and have it checked for flatness. If its not, they will machine it to be flat. The main reason this needs to be done is because most head gaskets go because the engine has been overheated. On an engine with an iron block and aluminum head like the miata, that means very bad things for the aluminum head.   As for actually changing it. Put the motor in top dead center before you do ANYTHING. Then Unbolt the exhaust manifold and intake manifolds from the head. Take off your valve cover and front timing covers. Take off your timing belt by undoing the tensioners and slipping the belt off. Then you are going to want to take the cams out (only if removing the cams is necessary, I dont remember if it is) There will also be random misc. stuff you need to take off/unplug. Along with the coil packs on the back of the engine and the CAS.   Once all that is done you can get at your head bolts and take them out and then lift the head off the block. Coolant will most likely go everywhere.   After that you get your head checked and its all good to go, you basically do the exact reverse with new gaskets and stuff.   It wouldnt be a bad idea at all at this moment to do all maintenance in there as well. Including a waterpump, valve cover gasket, Intake Gasket, and Exhaust gasket. And honestly, it would be a really good idea to have the valve stem seals in the head replaced. The machine shop will do this for you and I suggest paying them to do it, otherwise its a massive pain in your ass that isnt worth the headache. So if you dont have the cash to pay them to do it (Maybe $30?) then dont bother replacing them at all.   Put it all back together and hopefully you have a happy car again.   Oh, and I cannot stress this enough. USE THE CORRECT FUCKING TORQUE SPECS WITH A RELIABLE TORQUE WRENCH. I have no idea what level of experience you have but Ive seen way too many idiots put a motor together and wonder why everything falls apart when they didnt use torque specs. Just ""tight"". Ugh.   Good luck.  Edit: Also, change your oil afterwards BEFORE you start it. Coolant will get in the cylinders and leak passed the rings into your oil. That is a very bad thing. So just once you are done, do an oil change to make sure everything is fresh. Also, this is just a rough run down of what you need to do and is not comprehensive. If you really want a step by step, get a Hayne's manual. They are pretty helpful when you havent done a job on a certain car before. It alleviates most of the ""WHY WONT THIS FUCKING THING BUDGE"" occasions."
Miata,3afozq,Griffin-dork,1 point,Fri Jun 19 20:52:17 2015 UTC,"To clarify, my head gasket isn't blown, but I'm feeling down on power and it looks like it's leaking. The car has never overheated since I got it ~5k+ miles ago. I did the valve cover gasket right when I got it since it was leaking, and the bolts are fine to re-use. Is it possible to replace the head gasket without having to do the valve cover again? Is it necessary to take the cams out and the CAS? Just did the CAS o-ring as well and that's a pain in the ass to put in and out."
Miata,3afozq,Nopethefuckout94,2,Fri Jun 19 21:26:19 2015 UTC,"Yes just use a dab of rtv to help keep the valve cover in the cover. But clean every surface very well and put a microfiber cloth over the block to avoid anything undesirable getting in. This replacement should take you only seven hours but, depending on what time of day you start you might have to finish another day or something will come up that you want/need to replace. Also have someone help you the head is not light and you don't want to damage it. That is my two cents."

Miata,3acz3y,Pyr0monk3y,3,Fri Jun 19 02:38:52 2015 UTC,Why use hand signals instead of indicators ? On track days here in EU we indicate to the right or left because having your arm out kinda sucks when you try to haul ass.
Miata,3acz3y,trancematzl15,2,Fri Jun 19 08:39:53 2015 UTC,"So in many track day sessions, the run group require a point-by for passing - i.e. if you're going to pass me, I have to stick my arm out the window and explicitly point you by. Which is good, it keeps things safer.  The problem we inevitably face is that, in our tiny little Miatas, we catch -everybody- in the corners, and then get stuck dogging their bumpers through every turn, because they point us by in the straightaways... then stomp on the gas. I was stuck behind a 911 for 7 laps at Laguna Seca like this a few weeks ago, because he would point me by when we exited a corner, then stomp on the gas and fly away. But a turn or two later, I was right behind him, waiting."

It is fixable but not exactly easy. It makes it hard to clean the dash because it either leaves a mark or lint sticks to it.   Check to see of timing belt and water pump have been done. It is about time for those in that car. Its about $200 in parts for a diy, or ??? If you pay someone.  Looks very nice though. I just bought my current 92 black and tan. Paid 3300 for 91k miles, a few dings and scratches, a pretty noticeable paint chip on the bumper, and cracked leather seats (not destroyed like most buy worn and cracked). Also had a snugtop brand hard top, and all 4 mint BBS wheels with caps..

I approach it and notice my wife basking in the sun her skins glows with the same tone as that of an angel. In this moment I notice a glint, a glare even and point my eyes into the distance and notice my one true love aswell basking in the sun. My heart races steadily as my mind drifts into a daydream. A daydream of yesterday's past where I'd drift my one true love through the dirty mountains roads that are thin and long. Winding and waving much like the path of life. My wife takes notice to my presence and offers a gesture of love. A kiss that I happily accept. She closes her I eyes and I leave mine open staring at my love in the distance. I whisper I love you. My wife whispers I love you too. I think to myself miata I will never leave you saying aloud only the words I will never leave you. My wife smiles and goes back to sun bathing.

Miata,3a762h,cnuttin,9,Wed Jun 17 21:50:50 2015 UTC,"I own a white NA and a white NB, and side by side I see the difference.  The NA is honest. It's a super-reliable Lotus Elan tribute car. It's cute, but it's low and unassuming, and it narrows its eyes until you flick the lights and it's all ""HEY THERE!"" The cute is hidden, then the lights pop up and everybody laughs.  The NB isn't as ""business"" as the NA. The sides are bulgier and flared. It has a big gaping mouth and wide sparkly eyes. It looks like it's puffing out its chest and trying to pass as a bigger, more muscular car than it really is.  The NC has even bigger flared wheel wells, and the whole body has an overstuffed look. To an even greater extent, it appears to be puffing out its chest, and flaring its little fenders. The ""cute"" is gone, replaced with a kind of fluffy sort of quasi-macho stance, and macho it ain't. The NB and NC look like a Miata, and they're great cars, but when you line them up you can't help but feel that maybe the later models seem to be trying just a bit too hard."

Miata,3a5nd9,Dr_Avocado,11,Wed Jun 17 13:06:01 2015 UTC,"ITBs,  individual throttle bodies."
Miata,3a5nd9,karmavorous,2,Wed Jun 17 13:09:23 2015 UTC,Why would you want this?
Miata,3a5nd9,crispychicken49,24,Wed Jun 17 13:43:34 2015 UTC,"From the factory, Miatas (and most other cars too) have one single throttlebody to feed and throttle all four cylinders.  Behind this single throttlebody there is a thing called a plenum which distributes the air from the one throttle body into the individual cylinder ports. And those individual cylinder ports are long and bend 90 degrees or more. This is done for packaging and efficiency (fuel efficiency and manufacturing efficiency) reasons. Straight runners and/or putting the plenum closer to the intake ports would make the engine harder to integrate into the car.  But those long curving ports decrease the velocity and volume of the air going into the engine which reduces max power at high RPMs.  The huge volume of air between the throttle plates and the intake valves induces some lag into the throttle - as when you give it the boot, it takes a few fractions of a second for the increased airflow to find its way into the engine.  ITBs give you a short, fat, straight shot into the cylinders - increasing the amount of air getting into the cylinders at high RPM.  The throttlebody is closer to the valves, so throttle response is more immediate and more sharp.  Those bell shaped things on the end of each throttle body is called a velocity stack and they're designed to maximize airflow into the throttlebody - which is also something that doesn't happen as well on cars with a single throttlebody and plenum setup.  The major downside to ITBs is syncing them all up so that they idle correctly. Between the 1 and 2 throttlebody and between the 3 and 4 throttlebody you can something that looks like a nut or bolt sticking up. That's the adjustment to sync each throttlebody. And they have to be dead nuts to get a smooth idle. At idle each cylinder draws so little air that even a tiny variance in the sync can cause the engine to idle very roughly.  That's why cars don't come with this kind of setup very often. Because they must be tuned regularly by someone who knows what they're doing.  There's also probably some emissions reasons they don't do them.  Also you'll notice no air filter. You can put pod filters on them, but many people don't, adding filters might reduce ITB effectiveness to a minor degree. So that might be another reason manufacturers don't bother with them.  EDIT:   Oh, yeah, and they sound fucking awesome.   If you've only ever driven a car with a plenum type fuel injection, you might be surprised how much noise the intake side of an engine produces. You've heard the exhaust side (which can be good or bad music), but there's also a song going on on the intake side. It sounds pretty nice when you can hear it. Especially on 4 valve engines (dating myself by making that distinction). Plenums and long intake tracts totally drown out that sound on most stock cars.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4cCNUY0FC4"

Miata,3a5nd9,itshonestwork,1 point,Wed Jun 17 22:47:30 2015 UTC,"The north American S52 didn't have them but it's not a true ""s"" engine."
Miata,3a5nd9,karmavorous,7,Wed Jun 17 23:45:57 2015 UTC,"They won't bother with them because they have to make cars that can last in lots of environments, with lots of emissions regulations.  An intake system that has no filtration, or means to route crankcase cases or other fumes, that requires careful setup and maintenance, that can and does reduce power lower down, and only nets single figure BHP gains at the top of the power band is a stupid thing to put on a road car.  It's an excellent thing to put on a race car where engines are rebuilt, and you may be limited to a certain engine capacity without supercharging. Where you spend 90% of your time right at the top of the rev range. In a relatively low powered and close racing series, an extra 8-12bhp is enormous.  The factory MX-5 is a solid and well mannered every day Roadster. The intake system on it, on some models, is even pulse-tuned with resonance chambers along the pipework.  The standard system isn't a cost saving one, it's a well thought out one for making an every day road going sports car. It is a system designed for a large range of usage, to make it a good road car, and a good back road car.  ITB's were designed with a single thought process, and that is maximum airflow at high RPM. Nothing else matters in the context they are used.  If they were fitted by the manufacturer, and even self calibrating and easy to make, they'd still drop them in favour of a variable length intake runner system. Not to mention filtration on an engine that you want to last for more than a season or two.  If you want throttle response, lighten the flywheel. I used to have a shitty VW Polo I bought off an automotive engineering student that had lightened the flywheel, and lightened and balanced the crank, including knife edging. It was like a fucking motorbike, even with a supercharger dragging and having to pressurise first."
Miata,3a5nd9,itshonestwork,5,Wed Jun 17 15:44:23 2015 UTC,"I totally agree about them not being appropriate on a car that is mostly a street car. I didn't mean to imply that everybody should get some.   They totally suck at idle and mid range/partial throttle.   The grown up in my understand that the factory system is superior in just about every way.  But the kid in me loves 'em for the look and sound and jaw dropping street cred that you get when some 18 year old kid sees them on your car.  I had a Datsun 510 with dual Weber DCOEs when I was younger. They looked awesome. They sounded awesome. They made kids who were younger than the can gawk at it at autocrosses.  But every single year when autocross season was over and I still had to drive the car to work in the cold, I'd spend a day yanking them off and cleaning them up and storing them away. And I'd put on a simple Weber DGV that made 95% as much power and was 20% more fuel efficient. And then in the Spring I'd procrastinate on putting them back on because other than the sound and the slight power gain at WFO, they were awful to live with.  ITBs aren't impossible to live with - if you do them right. They're not unsafe or anything. You can still work out a system for positive crankcase ventilation. They're not on/off switches like Indy Cars use. Most people would not choose them for a street car, but there is a reason that some people do... maybe not good reasons, but there is a method to their madness anyway..."

Miata,3a5nd9,Nopethefuckout94,1 point,Wed Jun 17 19:35:16 2015 UTC,"Part of it is probably heat related as these sensors aren't typically rated for under bonnet temps (You can get them, they're just more expensive), but primarily it's because it simply doesn't matter.   Forgive me as this will get a little technical...  You don't use a MAP sensor in the same way that you do something like an IAT sensor. That is, you can't just measure its value at any old time and assume that you've got a good reading. The signal from the MAP sensor is actually a waveform due to the way the pressure increases and decreases as the inlet valves open and close. In every crank revolution, you have a number of peaks and troughs equal to half the number of cylinders (Assuming a 4 stroke engine). For Speed -Density fueling, the only values you care about are the ones at the bottom of the troughs as these represent the maximum vacuum that the engine is pulling. In the case of a 4 cylinder, you'll have 2 of those troughs every crank revolution, so once you have gotten that minimum value, it's use for about another 180 crank degrees until you get another minimum. This means that any small time delay you might get due to having 6ft of vac line between the sensor and the ECU is totally irrelevant, as long as you're able to get one of those minimum values within the same 720 cycle.   ITBs are a whole different story though...."

I thought about doing this, and using the on board megasquirt sensor for live barometric correction but was advised against it and I couldn't see why.   Another problem with running that length of vacuum line is that every twist turn and pinch is adding to the pressure difference between the manifold and the ecu. Case in point - I reinstalled my passenger seat, and suddenly my idle reading was 3kpa higher. Maybe it's inconsequential, but it just seems like one on-engine would be the ideal case."

Getting a dent in your door is practically totaling the car (maybe not in your case, but on a 200k 1991 Miata...).  This is a very similar reason as to why motorcycles are cheap to insure. Cause very little damage, and don't cost nearly as much as a comparable sports car.  I'm 20 years old with no tickets and no accidents on my father's policy, and pay $700 per year for my car.

That's what I thought would happen when I bought mine, but my experience has been the complete opposite. Pretty much everyone that says something to me about it has said what a great little car it is. This week while stuck in traffic, I actually had a guy in a Ford Raptor shout out the window, ""The answer is always Miata!"" Made my day."

Miata,3a7qdd,IfailedAFF1,2,Wed Jun 17 21:55:15 2015 UTC,You could look and see if it is your ignition control unit. I really hope that not your problem because they are like $200 usd. Also I do not know how you'd test it other than take it to a shop and have them do it. Since it doesn't start and stay started you could call a shop in advance and tow it there or say fuck it and buy an ICU and two new coil packs and see if that works. Uhm also check your wires coming from the ICU to your fuse box and see if there is anything out of the ordinary. Ooo ooo go to a wrecker and buy the ICU from the same model year for cheap and its coil packs to see if it works.

It doesn't seem to correlate with any mechanical changes. The 2002 manual shows 5W-30 for all conditions or 10W-30 allowed for temps over 0F just like all the previous models.

Miata,3a4nb5,emeraldarcana,16,Wed Jun 17 10:32:56 2015 UTC,"I was in the neighborhood where my parents live recently. Driving my red NA.  Coming up the road in the other direction was another red NA.  Before I could even see them, I made a judgement about the other driver.  In this neighborhood, it's probably a kid driving. And that kids parents probably gave them the car. And that kid would probably rather have a Mustang or a Jeep. Probably not an enthusiast. No flip for you!  As our cars were about 10' away from passing, the other Miata owner flipped his headlights, AND waved, AND his passenger waved both her hands over the top of the windshield. I think one of them might have even yelled something.  It all happened so fast I couldn't respond. My finger was no where near the headlight flipper switch. My top was up so I couldn't wave or yell in any appreciable way.  I was the asshole.  I was the snubber, not the snubbee.  I was the bad Miata driver. Not only because I didn't wave or flip or even honk.  But also because I had made an assumption about my brethren based on the road they were driving on.  Driving on this road? This guy couldn't possibly be a Miata enthusiast...  But I was also driving on that road.  And that guy didn't make the assumption about me. He was ready to feel like an idiot by flipping his headlight at someone even if that person totally turned out to be asshole and not return the flip.  Which is exactly what happened. He flipped and waved and did everything he could to greet me, and I looked back at him like he was an idiot... with my top up because it was too hot...  So now I've learned my lesson. I'll flip my headlights at every Miata I see.   Miatas driving down the road.  Parked Miatas.  Miatas on tow trucks.   When I go to the junkyard, I'll count all the Miatas there and when I leave I'll flip my lights once for every fallen hero inside.  If I see a Miata commercial on TV, I'll go outside and flip my lights just to be safe.  I don't want to be the non-flipping asshole again."

Sure, it has a quieter, smoother ride, but you just don't feel as connected to the road. I bought an NA because I wanted a cheap sports car that I could go all out with and not be worried about breaking all the time. The NCs are just too expensive of a car to thrash for me."

Miata,3a374s,PrintError,8,Tue Jun 16 22:46:07 2015 UTC,"Miatas are cheap for basically three reasons.  First, they make them out of the least expensive material required to do the job, and they tend to use preexisting, commonly-manufactured engines.  Second, they can get away with the first reason because Miatas, even the new one, are extremely simple cars.  There's just not that much that has to go into them.  Finally, they make a LOT of Miatas.  Literally a million of them.  That keeps costs down overall, and Mazda gains the security in knowing the car will never flop."

The entire transmission/drivetrain needs to support that kind of power, the brakes need to be heavily upgraded, the suspension needs to handle the new top speeds, the car needs to cool that massive engine,  the whole thing needs to be made with more expensive parts to offset the added weight, tires, wheels, generally to cope with it (And to keep their customers alive) advanced traction control systems are added and launch modes are implemented. Then you likely have to invest even more in safety for that more powerful car.   The relatively low output ~165 horsepower engine is a massive savings everywhere else.   Sure you have the trim upgrades, some nicer speakers and electronic gee-wiz, but the real cost is the platform."

I've detailed White, Silver, and Beige paints before and all have shown a visible improvement.   Even a quick detail as simple as washing, running a clay-bar over the surface, and waxing with a nice quality wax will smooth out the paint, and put a lovely shine on it.  Head over to /r/AutoDetailing for more info if you haven't detailed before."
Miata,3a1ikn,AnsonLuke,8,Tue Jun 16 14:29:15 2015 UTC,"Waste of money. Really no point in doing mods to the intake/exhaust unless you plan on running a tunable ecu to really take advantage of those mods, and even then you're really only netting yourself 10-20hp. Only other reason I could think of is sound, if you want that then be my guest. It is my opinion just leave it all stock till you have enough money for a supercharger or turbo setup."
Miata,3a1ikn,Zenie,6,Tue Jun 16 15:26:45 2015 UTC,Waste. Heat soaks easy and you lose low end torque. Get a new stock one if your old one is broken.
Miata,3a1ikn,bubblegutsyndrome,2,Tue Jun 16 16:21:19 2015 UTC,"From what I've heard you lose performance if you eliminate the stock crossover tube... You may want to consider one that replaces only the stock airbox? I think a cone filter and shield type setup like the DDM works one may be better. That said, I still have my stock airbox."
Miata,3a1ikn,nick470,1 point,Tue Jun 16 14:43:24 2015 UTC,They don't necessarily lose performance. Usually with a tube like this it can gain some HP in the top end but losses Tourqe down low. To make overall power there has to be an air chamber like the ARC.
Miata,3a1ikn,ateamm,1 point,Tue Jun 16 15:11:09 2015 UTC,"Any insight into what that ARC actually does for the flow? I'm curious, if a more knowledgeable individual could explain it."
Miata,3a1ikn,nick470,1 point,Tue Jun 16 19:35:39 2015 UTC,"All it does is has a big belly instead of a strait tube. Basically it's supposed to be an improvement in torque and HP over the stock intake where as a standard aftermarket intake will make a bit of hp on the top end but lose some torque off the bottom.   So instead of compromising torque for HP over the stock intake, it works like the stock intake but better.  I have seen images and explanations about why a chamber like that does what it does for torque but I can't seem to find any right now.  Also they are not produced anymore, are super expensive, and hard to find."
Miata,3a1ikn,ateamm,-1,Tue Jun 16 21:39:48 2015 UTC,"I have no idea what it does, I imagine it looks cool, weighs a lot, and that's about it.   Helmholtz resonance, search it on google.

Miata,3a1ikn,pakron,3,Tue Jun 16 18:27:36 2015 UTC,"Unless your current one has a hole in it, it's age doesn't make a lick of difference. Also that one does not have a resonator in the pipe like the stock one. You may gain 1 HP above 5500 RPM, but you will lose a little bit of torque around 2800 RPM. You need that low end torque way more often."

It's true you will lose the helmholtz in the std x-over pipe so there will be a noticeable dip in low end torque. It's also true if you use a pod filter at the end of it you will be getting tons of heat soak. (You can see in my pic I used a 45 deg alu bend in between the afm & pod).   but goddamn my intake sound is so glorious.

Miata,3a2twc,GeckoDeLimon,2,Wed Jun 17 13:11:26 2015 UTC,"You may have better luck listing it at 3500, and then selling the hard top separate. Or list it as ""1992 Mazda Miata WITH HARDTOP""."
Miata,3a2twc,69th,6,Wed Jun 17 13:55:34 2015 UTC,I'd pay no more than 3k for the car and the top. I got mine with a hard top for 2.7k and 160k on the dash. Paint the hardtop to match. Telling people you're going to charge them to put the stock parts on? Seriously poor form. Not a good way to let people know you're a good guy to negotiate with.  Just because you put a ton of money into the car doesn't mean you're getting one cent of it back.
Miata,3a2twc,poptartsnbeer,2,Tue Jun 16 23:10:45 2015 UTC,"Yeah the price is pretty steep for a '92 with 150k on it, but why do you consider it bad form to want something in return for doing a bunch of work on the car?  The car is in working order with the modified parts and OP is already including the stock parts in the sale. Swapping everything over takes their time and effort, which has value, and that can be included in the bargaining process.  Not trying to be a dick, just interested in why you find it off-putting for OP to make that offer. In their position I would have considered doing the same thing, but wouldn't want to if it's going to be driving away potential buyers."

A stock Miata is worth way more than any modded Miata (except maybe a turboed out Miata).  If you mod the hell out of your car, then ask potential buyers to cover the majority of the costs associated with doing that, you're gonna have a bad time."
Miata,3a2twc,iRunPreMix,0,Wed Jun 17 15:26:38 2015 UTC,"You obviously don't sell cars very much. If the mods are functional and aren't rice, people respect it and pay up for it.

Miata,3a2twc,murica_ftw,1 point,Sun Jun 21 03:50:51 2015 UTC,"You obviously don't sell cars very much.   I've owned and sold 8 vehicles in my driving lifetime.  I've also helped my friends and family sell about a dozen+ more private party.  When you make an assumption about someone you don't know and write a statement like that, you make an ass out of yourself.    If the mods are functional and aren't rice, people respect it and pay up for it.    Anyone that mods a car, no matter what those mods are, will never fully recover the cost associated to put those mods on a car.  Stupid people may pay full retail + full mods parts value for a used modded out car, but those idiots are very rare.    You seem to be the only one in this thread that thinks this NA is worth anything over $3.5k.     $5k is a realistic asking price, you'll get around $4500 with the top, $3500 without   Best of luck to OP with that.  If OP can get $5k for this NA, more power to him."
Miata,3a2twc,iRunPreMix,0,Sun Jun 21 15:24:13 2015 UTC,"$5k is the asking price.... It's what you're asking for. Meaning it's the base for negotiations. It's not outlandish for what it is, either. There are some good parts on there, and the cosmetic damage is a minor detail considering you can get a whole fender in awesome shape for less than $100.   As far as recovering value from mods, it all depends on how much you pay for them and how well the work is done. If you got a roll bar for free and installed it, you can most certainly add the cost of the bar in your price. Same with a seat install. If you get seats for way cheap, tack that price onto your asking price. The only value you will hardly ever see returned is your time/labor.  Good for you. I've sold over 14 vehicles this year, ranging from cars and trucks to jetskis. Most of them I acquired in less than great shape, restored them myself and turned a profit on almost everything. I've never lost money, but I've certainly broke even on a few. Maybe you just need more practice.   edit: - 4 stand up jet skis, 1 waverunner, 5 motorcycles, 2 cars, 1 truck, 3 trailers, 3 gopeds (lol, more profitable than some cars believe it or not) a dirtbike and a gokart.... So realistically 13 titled vehicles and then just other miscellaneous motorized things. Get the shit cheap, do your own work, make money.  Let me upload some pics real quick and I'll show you what kind of stuff I start with and how it ends up"

Miata,3a2twc,69th,3,Sun Jun 21 19:11:08 2015 UTC,"In my opinion, if you modify a car at all, and you decide there's even the slightest iota that you may sell it, you should keep in mind that all the modifications may be a deterrent to future buyers. So, if you're willing to sell it with the stock parts, the least you can do is reinstall them before listing it. More potential buyers when you say ""comes stock, but willing to include custom parts as well, here are some photos"".   That said, I'm only talking about the cosmetics here. If there were, say, a turbo, I wouldn't be suggesting you remove it and all that. The cosmetics here are simple to remove and the stock parts are simple to install."

Miata,3a2twc,iRunPreMix,2,Wed Jun 17 05:33:52 2015 UTC,"Price seems very high for a 1.6NA with that mileage, especially with body damage. A minimal search of craigslist says $4900  would get at least an '05 with 133k on it, maybe better. I'd say $2.5-$3k without knowing anything about the mods you've made.  If you think the mods add significant value then I'd suggest listing them in full in the ad. Without that would be hard to tell what they would be worth to me as a buyer, so I would assume not much until proven otherwise."

Miata,3a0bxn,HalfAGoonAndHalfAGod,1 point,Tue Jun 16 05:58:27 2015 UTC,"Have you done an ""italian tune up"" in a while?  Carbon deposits are a common cause of detonation (pinging) and can build up if an engine isn't run hard once in a while.  Take it out, warm it up and run it up to redline a few times with some hard acceleration.  If that doesn't work, you're gonna have to start to do things like pull the spark plugs to see if one of the cylinders isn't burning properly."

Miata,3a0bxn,PrintError,1 point,Tue Jun 16 13:45:54 2015 UTC,"I have a 2003 and my car has pinged since I've owned the car (two years) during the Las Vegas summers. Its a problem that I can not seem to fix using 91 octane. Here are my recommendations for now:   Pump a gallon or two of 100 octane, or use 93 octane if available. This should solve your problem if it is indeed pinging. Use an octane booster if you can not find higher octane fuel. Read on octane boosters first before purchasing. Make sure your coolant temperatures are normal and ideally below 210. If not replace radiator and/or coolant. Route cold air to the stock intake by using HVAC piping through the small hole below the passenger headlight. (This may or may not work, it hasn't for me) Run a a few bottle of Techron fuel system cleaner or BG 44K fuel system cleaner. (Also might not work) Use sea-foam into the manifold.   This is a problem I am still trying to solve to this day> I have tried colder spark plugs with no luck. Currently I am trying to reduce intake temperatures which is why I routed cold air to the OEM intake. Routing cold air to the OEM intake dropped my intake temperatures 25 to 35 degrees Fahrenheit. My next step is to purchase a Track-Dog racing header heat shield and using it with the OEM heat shield."

Miata,39yg50,firedude212,6,Tue Jun 16 06:23:58 2015 UTC,Your parents will buy you what they want.  When I was your age I wanted a sports car. I ended up in the old Sebring convertible. When that died my dad bought me a new g6 sedan.   I had dreams of a used Wrx or bmw or something but when it wasn't my money; I was happy to get anything.   If your parents don't like the miata; doubt they'll get you one. If they're like my family.   Good luck. Buy one later in life. I'm 25 and just got my first
Miata,39yg50,MaxxTheSpeculator,6,Tue Jun 16 10:13:46 2015 UTC,"It's tough to convince them to get you a small, often unseen, convertible. If you can get through that part and convince them that your first car should be a sportscar, you shouldn't have any issue finding an NA miata within your budget. Some things you should consider/your parents will probably say to you when you try and argue FOR the Miata:   You're 16 and want a sports car for your first car.  It is impractical. It will not handle well in the winter (fun but not well). Trucks/SUVs have a hard time seeing you. If you flip, you are dead. Unless you have a rollbar.. maybe.  It's rear wheel drive and your inexperience as a driver may cause you to spin out more easy than you might think.   Personally, I am 25 and bought my first NA miata last summer. I also have a WRX and I could not imagine having a Miata as a daily. I love the shit out of mine and in the summer I DO daily it but in the winter, you're really better off driving something else. It will handle it OK... JUST OK. Ground clearance becomes an issue quickly and if you're in the northeast or somewhere else that gets a lot of snow... GL maintaining the car and not rusting it to shit.   I'm all for Miatas but I can't recommend this car as a daily and I'm sure your parents will not either. That said, get a GC8. It's AWD, in that price range, ""cool"" and it will be more ""new driver friendly"" IMO."
Miata,39yg50,SvartHrafn,2,Mon Jun 15 21:19:18 2015 UTC,"As someone with both a GC8 and a NA6, I can finally help! GC8 is a great car that handles and accelerates totally different than a Miata. A lot more useable power unless you have a timing bump. Here are some ways I convinced my parents to let me have a Miata though -Cheap to own/insure/maintain -Great gas mileage for what it is (I just got 37 on my last tank.)  -Parts are easy to find if you do make a mistake driving, and the scene is full of generally helpful people -Your mom will like it because it'll remind her of her hairdresser"

Miata,39yg50,bubblegutsyndrome,2,Tue Jun 16 17:03:16 2015 UTC,"The best advice I could offer is that the car is fairly cheap, very reliable, easy to work on, and with a 1.6-1.8L engine its hard to get in to too much trouble. Safety is probably what is holding your parents back; and for good reason. From what I've seen the car does fairly well front and rear, but side impact is pretty nasty. There also is the possibility of rolling the car, which generally you have to be doing something really stupid to do. The car also isn't the most practical, with only one passenger seat and a small trunk.   Bottom line: Cheap to buy, insure, and maintain. Solid MPG (I get around 30) and  very reliable with basic maintenance, though be prepared to dump around $400 or so into the car after purchase. Just pitch it to your folks the best you can and try and leave out the obvious impracticalities. I'm 19 and bought one 2 months ago after saving up from part time jobs; haven't had a single regret. Just be prepared for the hairdresser and gay jokes lol.   Good Luck and I hope it works out for you"
Miata,39yg50,Slyons89,1 point,Wed Jun 17 01:43:40 2015 UTC,I suggest you get one...nb and older should all be under 5500 just make sure the one you get isn't a pile of crap. If you live somewhere with snow get something else that you can drive safely in the winter.
Miata,39yg50,itsorange,1 point,Mon Jun 15 21:50:57 2015 UTC,"In my personal experience you need a safer car for a first car. I wrecked my first car pretty badly and I'm glad it wasn't a Miata. Others will disagree. A miata is a good first car for learning how to drive a car, but it isn't a good car to have your first accident in, and that's probably what your parents will think as well.  Get some other manual transmission car. Then buy your own miata once you have a job and can save a few thousand. You'll feel like you've earned your roadster and you'll love it even more."
Miata,39yg50,halsey1006,1 point,Mon Jun 15 22:07:07 2015 UTC,"Are you asking for help convincing them? If so, tough sell as it's rationality a bad choice so let's highlight the positives and build a plan against the negatives.  Positives: cheap to operate, ie maintenance, insurance, purchase price. Reliable. Good resale value. Cool and you will love and take care of it.  The obvious negatives are unsafe... To combat this tell your parents you will take a defensive driving course. Good defensive driving coupled with a nimble car is arguably safer then a large car with a bad driver.  No passenger room: argue that you will not be distracted as you will not be transporting a gang of idiot friends like you would driving a mini van.  Small size/no truck space: Emphasize how easy it is to park and how parallel parking will be a piece of cake. Often college parking sucks. Small cars have the upper hand here.  Well.. I hope that helps. Also, Im serious about the driving course. Car crashes are no joke, car crashes in small topless cars especially."

Miata,39w4eb,miatainkansas,5,Mon Jun 15 07:35:16 2015 UTC,"Do they actually work, like better light at night? Everything I've read about fixed headlights says they kinda suck on light output, is there enough room there for all the light pattern to escape, basically?  My buckets are trashed and my headlights roll all over the place, driving at night is a by memory experience. Driving at night in the rain's nuts, can't see squat. I'm planning on fitting some hid projectors in some PVC tube with some clear lenses made out of caps or something, all mounted to low-rise doors so you won't ever see how ugly they look."
Miata,39w4eb,Mvance30,14,Mon Jun 15 08:17:53 2015 UTC,They don't suck because they're popups. They suck because of the bulb design. You can easily swap out better headlights into the pop up housing without needing to take it all out.   Personally popups are my favorite part about the NA over an NB.
Miata,39w4eb,trancematzl15,7,Mon Jun 15 12:18:56 2015 UTC,"I'm going to be honest and say they really don't work well at night. This is because i bought a large sealed beam headlight. Its the same headlight that people use in a RX7. Because it is a sealed beam i had to make brackets. The brackets i made had poor clearance with the ""Lens"" so i had to mount em slightly lower. To use the headlight i used you need to cut the front bumper slightly. If you are going to make some fixed lights, do not buy a sealed beam. You can get non sealed on Amazon and just drill holes on the bottom of the light or something. Also get a smaller beam. Essentially you want it to sit as high as it can sit. BTW if you need material for a lens, i got a shit ton of lexan that i found in trash. That's how i made mine. I can give you some or make the lenses for you."

Miata,39w4eb,retrofitme,1 point,Mon Jun 15 16:38:19 2015 UTC,I personally don't like how they look.

Miata,39w4eb,m50,1 point,Mon Jun 15 20:28:51 2015 UTC,Poor construction. They look gross and throw off the look of the whole car.  You don't buy an NA to get rid of the popups.
Miata,39z796,jazzman317,2,Mon Jun 15 23:52:35 2015 UTC,So when are you buying another miata!
Miata,39z796,Creativeusername833,3,Tue Jun 16 01:10:32 2015 UTC,As soon as my newborn son is big enough to ride in the front. :)
Miata,39z796,Nopethefuckout94,2,Tue Jun 16 02:07:11 2015 UTC,By that time the ND will be about 18k so you get a safer miata to have your son in aswell. This is if you consider big enough to be 6 or 7.
Miata,39z796,ArguablyTasty,1 point,Tue Jun 16 04:40:40 2015 UTC,Nice! I'll be waiting. Maybe I can catch an NC with a cool engine swap or something. I've always thought a mildly-boosted V6 would be better suited to the Miata than an LSx.

There have been 2 or 3 in the 3500-5000 dollar range in the past week that have popped up. SF Bay Area. Make sure the surrounding areas checkbox is marked in the search filter.  But I'm looking specifically for a 94 or 95 twin turbo so there's that.  Sadly, I can't buy for another year. Need to pay off my Honda Fit I just got as a daily driver."
Miata,39z796,jjjenningsiii,1 point,Tue Jun 16 04:25:27 2015 UTC,Twin turbo? Wat
Miata,39z796,pinkwaffles,1 point,Tue Jun 16 10:26:05 2015 UTC,"Deals are tough to find in the Bay Area.  I was scouring craigslist for a month, checked out multiple cars that were either complete shit, or just modded using questionable parts.  Ended up finding a 92 under 100k w/ LSD, new top + timing belt done less than 1k ago for $2800. Car was a little beat up on the exterior, but it runs like a champ...especially after my suspension overhaul."
Miata,39z796,tyllsny,1 point,Wed Jun 17 00:54:27 2015 UTC,Yeah. It isn't going to be fun trying to locate a 94/95 in decent condition in about a year when I'm ready to buy. But half the reason I'm getting it is to learn to wrench so I don't mind buying a project car.
Miata,39x4mw,nick470,4,Mon Jun 15 14:53:44 2015 UTC,Pretty much everything you'd want to know  http://949racing.com/miata-race-alignment-info.aspx
Miata,39x4mw,Oricle10110,2,Mon Jun 15 15:47:41 2015 UTC,"I had my best results on a mild drop with:  Front: -2.5º camber, 0 toe, 5.5º caster  Rear: -2.0º camber, 0 toe.  Car was heavily tracked and autocrossed. Tire wear was basically irrelevant."
Miata,39x4mw,PrintError,1 point,Mon Jun 15 15:11:31 2015 UTC,So you think more front camber? I guess I'm really just trying to understand what the rationale is for having either more front or rear... Lots of the popular alignments call for more rear.
Miata,39x4mw,PrintError,1 point,Mon Jun 15 15:18:18 2015 UTC,"I ran more rear for a few years before experimenting with more front. Gave me more front bite and didn't really sacrifice any rear drive off the corners, so oversteer was well in check.  Try it and see for yourself. All else fails, bust out the wrenches and swap it to -2ºF and -2.5º rear, leave the toe, and try that instead.  More front worked really well for me though."
Miata,39x4mw,PrintError,1 point,Mon Jun 15 15:45:55 2015 UTC,What kind of sway bar setup did you run?
Miata,39x4mw,TrentonH1,1 point,Mon Jun 15 17:45:00 2015 UTC,"Racing Beat front, OEM rear. Car handled VERY neutral."
Miata,39x4mw,TheCiotti,1 point,Mon Jun 15 21:36:09 2015 UTC,"So I guess what I'm reading is that the FM alignment takes a stiffer rear sway bar into consideration.... Most people run a softer rear bar or none at all, and therefore a front-heavy camber bias to bring out a little oversteer. The FM alignment assumes a stiffer rear bar already bringing out a little oversteer, so more rear camber to keep that in check. I'm thinking, based on that info, of going with around -1.7 to -2 front and -2 to -2.3 rear, 0 toe, and caster set at whatever can get me those specs"
Miata,39x4mw,Miataguy94,1 point,Mon Jun 15 16:47:04 2015 UTC,I have fm vmaxx xxtreme coilovers with 15x8 +25 wheels and 225/45 hankook rs3's. I have -2 degrees of camber and 0 toe all the way around. I was trying to mimic the Dual duty alignment from 949 racing. Just got back from an autox it was very well balanced. It's definitely a good starting point.
Miata,39x4mw,thefirebuilds,1 point,Mon Jun 15 17:59:45 2015 UTC,"When I bring mine in I just ask for as much as possible up front and as little as possible in the rear :)  Even with a tiny bit of rake they've never been able to get me more in the front than the rear but at the current settings of 2.0 F - 2.1 R is dam near perfect, I can adjust the balance during transitions with the rake, steady state with the anti-sway bars, and entry/exit with the damping."
Miata,39x4mw,TimmyDeanSausage,0,Mon Jun 15 20:46:00 2015 UTC,"My set up for summer and autocross  Front Camber -- -1.8 Front Caster -- As far positive as she'll go Front Toe -- 0  Rear Cmaber -- -1.5 Rear Toe -- 1/8"" Total Toe Out  YMMV but this is a set up that keeps my '91 neutral in autocross with a stock motor, tein street basic springs and 205-50R15 Z2s"
Miata,39x4mw,thefirebuilds,1 point,Mon Jun 15 17:37:16 2015 UTC,"1/8"" Total Toe Out   That's a great way to end up in a wall."
Miata,39x4mw,Miataguy94,1 point,Tue Jun 16 16:19:17 2015 UTC,"Why? I'm running - 1.4 F camber with 1/8 toe out and -1.8 R camber 1/8 toe out on old, soft suspension and its working great for me. I had generally the same camber settings before with toe out in the front and in on the rear and it was very easy to oversteer but with the toe out in the rear it feels super planted going around high speed bends. Drifts are even much more controllable, or at least it's easier to control transitions from full traction to drifting and back. Again that's on 21 year old suspension so it's probably different with an actually decent setup. What is your reason for not liking toe out in the rear?"
Miata,39x4mw,thefirebuilds,0,Tue Jun 16 16:42:30 2015 UTC,What is your reason for not liking toe out in the rear?   I don't like my car in the wall.
Miata,39x4mw,Miataguy94,1 point,Tue Jun 16 17:05:46 2015 UTC,How so? Seems to work great for me in autocross
Miata,39x4mw,thefirebuilds,1 point,Tue Jun 16 19:56:23 2015 UTC,I imagine it would.  In a high speed corner you're going to load a tire that's steering the back end in the opposite direction of travel.  It's great for low speed turn in but terrifying at straight line speed or high speed cornering.
Miata,39x4mw,Miataguy94,2,Tue Jun 16 20:03:59 2015 UTC,"Well, as I mentioned in my original post, for daily driving on highways and in autocross, my set up works fine for me.  If the guy was building a track-only car, I wouldn't know what to tell him because I don't take my miata on the track.  I also made sure to mention that his results may vary, but that setup works on my miata for my daily and autocross driving. I know a lot of miata owners that both daily and autocross with 1/8 out and I have yet to see one of their cars in a wall."
Miata,39x4mw,thefirebuilds,0,Tue Jun 16 20:07:24 2015 UTC,I wouldn't drive toe-out at highway speeds.
Miata,39x4mw,Miataguy94,1 point,Tue Jun 16 20:11:29 2015 UTC,"Can you explain why? Because, unless my alignment guy lied to me and just didn't align my car correctly, I have been driving on 1/8 out in the rear for months and never felt anywhere close to ""putting it into a wall"" or even breaking traction. And that also goes for driving in the rain on worn Z2s.  All I'm saying is if my set up would be dangerous, I think I would have noticed it and so far, I have not noticed it."

Then I saw the rust had made it's way around the actual bolt holes in the frame. So I pulled up the carpet, wire brushed around the holes, primed and painted, looks good as new.  With the seats out already I figured, why not do the foamectomy? Took apart the seat (those side bolts are tight!) and got the cover off. Gave the seat pan, which was super rusty, to my dad to sand blast. Not sure if it's worth powder coating or if paint will suffice to prevent future rust?  I cut off the bottom bulge like most tutorials state, I got pretty close to cutting out the back seat bottom wire. Hopefully it'll be pretty easy to reattach the material.  Ordered a couple seat warmers off of amazon this morning to stuff in while I have the seats apart. Will come in handy for cool evening drives. I know my wife will appreciate one for her seat.

Miata,39wa15,bubblegutsyndrome,1 point,Sat Jun 20 11:36:41 2015 UTC,Mine was a viper alarm and it basically boiled down to wire cut from the main ignition harness that was then run through this big mess of useless wires. I removed everything (HOLY FUCK I HATE VAMPIRE CLIPS) and spliced the main wire back together and it woks like a champ again. Granted it was wired into my fog lights in addition to some other stuff so I had to rewire all that back together. Hence next weeks project. Other than that tho.

Miata,39wpvs,halsey1006,2,Mon Jun 15 12:40:48 2015 UTC,"yep. I find mine won't go down when it's cold, and it's  usually because there's some fabric bunched up behind the bar that won't let it go back. Gently pushing on the glass while exerting some upwards pressure on the bar will usually make it slide through. Otherwise I have to manually work each corner of material underneath and through.  I also found that the larger window in the streamline hits my rollbar if I'm not careful about holding it while raising/lowering the top."
Miata,39wpvs,dpidcoe,2,Mon Jun 15 12:58:40 2015 UTC,"You might be missing the rear bar straps or weren't installed when the top was replaced.  When they are there, it's impossible to push the rear bar towards the back of the car.  I have the straps, so to lower the top I lift up on the front and while pushing it back, i place my palm over the vinyl above the rear window while gently pushing the rear bar forward; this causes the rear bar to slide away from the rear window and against the forward bar, clearing a path for the rear glass to go down."
Miata,39wpvs,funnythebunny,1 point,Mon Jun 15 14:06:37 2015 UTC,"Not just in regards to this ""issue"", but just in general...  What is different about the streamlined top vs. a normal replacement top?  I've seen pictures. They look really nice. Something is different than the normal top, but I can't tell what it is.

Take all the belts off and start the engine; if it's the timing belt pulleys and tensioner, the noise will continue.  DO NOT RUN engine for more than a minute without the belts; the water pump is disconnected and will likely boil over if not put back together.  This is just for testing purposes."

Things as simple as getting a 2nd key was quoted at $300+ (Immobilizer and key fob) at multiple dealers. While the Miata is far from an aging turbo BMW in maintenance, nothing is ever going to be as practical per mile driven as a ford econobox, hell, premium fuel would be in your future too, sporty tires that get half the tire wear life, better brakes, mods and upgrades, and more cleaning chemicals and waxes than you can shake a stick at. :D  One person wrecks your top and you could be dropping 1k USD on repairs. (Less if you DIY), one hidden issue the seller knows about but you don't could be that much, nobody sells a car with truly brand new brakes and new tires.   I wouldn't worry about the age and mileage as much as building up your savings buffer. Keep a 2007 with moderate miles in your sights, get some money in the bank, and maybe at 20 you can drive an incredibly fun awesome car. You are only young once and I very much doubt you will look back, fat, balding with kids and a minivan and regret the years you spent an extra 1-2k having a fun cool mildly impractical car."

I'm slowly inching on driving my Miata more in rotation to my regular sedan - but for now I can't trust driving it everyday yet (in case I have to pour money into it).

Tie rods, ball joints, steering rack bushings (probably this one right here)... Do your due diligence to see if it's really worth it for you. I'd suggest taking it to a mechanic and have them take a peek and give you a better explanation/quote if you aren't doing the work yourself. It's not difficult to do it just takes a bit of time to get to it"
Miata,39tsyt,iRunPreMix,1 point,Sun Jun 14 19:10:23 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your input.  I didn't mind the different ratio of the manual rack, but it made the car feel Very Serious, which isn't what I was going for - although it did fix the steering feel, which kind of nixes a bushing/steering assembly issue, right? I'd also be surprised if it's a mechanical problem on the car I drove today - it only had 82k miles and felt identical to my old one.  I had my old car checked out and aligned and they didn't find anything wrong (and alignment didn't help).  The 1.6s I've driven had more miles (one close to 150k) and both had better steering feel."
Miata,39tsyt,iRunPreMix,1 point,Sun Jun 14 19:41:36 2015 UTC,"I'm not entirely following you here. The NB has a lot of reinforcement in the engine bay and has power steering, so that's a no brainer why it handles better.  The 1.6 is lighter and more than likely didn't have power steering, and may have had bushings replaced in the interim. My 1.8 has some slop in it but it tracks like a mother..really sticks to the road. I haven't been in a 1.6 so I couldn't compare it but I can say for certain the NB handles the best out of the 1.8/1.6 chassis"
Miata,39tsyt,iRunPreMix,1 point,Sun Jun 14 19:46:01 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry if I wasn't clear, and I do appreciate your help - I didn't mean to imply that there was slop in the steering mechanism in any of the cars, but that the feedback through the wheel is lacking in both the 1.8s I've driven.  It's hard to explain, but in a corner - especially a sweeping curve like an entrance ramp - there is very little information coming back through the wheel about what the car is doing.  Maybe numbness is a better term than vagueness.  Both 1.6s I've driven have had power steering (I do know what a manual rack feels like! :-) ) and both have had better mid-corner feedback/feeling than both 1.8s I've driven with ps.    My wife describes the 1.8 steering as ""floaty"" compared to the 1.6, but I'm not sure if that's a great descriptor either.  It's precise and accurate but numb.  Anyway, I appreciate the help.  I may just be extra sensitive to steering feel. Edit: I see that you have a '95, and I wonder if it's something that came on later in the run, since the 96s and 97s sit a touch higher.  Both 1.8s I've driven have been '97s, though I've driven both '90 and '93 1.6s, which felt very similar to each other."

Honestly, an LS is still a better idea, more modern, more power stock, lighter, good fuel injection makes shit easier to tune than the carbs or speed density the FI 5.0 had. Yeah, LS swaps are common and kinda boring, but they're common for a reason. :)  All that said... The 5.0 is still a damn fine motor as long as you keep it under 450hp. Sounds great, too!"
Miata,39rpze,Troggie42,6,Sun Jun 14 05:25:27 2015 UTC,"That swap might have been done 20 years ago, too. People didn't just start putting v8's in Miata's when the LS came out."
Miata,39rpze,naughtykittyvoice,5,Sun Jun 14 10:12:11 2015 UTC,"Absolutely. I'd bet someone shoved a 5.0 in there within the first six months they were available. I'd bet someone shoves an LS in an ND within six months, too. It's the way of the world. Small car? SHOVE A V8 IN THAT MOFO!"
Miata,39rpze,Troggie42,2,Sun Jun 14 10:15:47 2015 UTC,It's not surprising considering many claim the 302 to be the poor man's v8 swap.  For the cost I'd rather go with an sr20 or any other motor with a good cheap after market.

Miata,39rpze,todayisanewbeginning,1 point,Sun Jun 14 04:21:26 2015 UTC,It's a lot of money to cram it in there and really not worth it. Same with any MX/VTEC swaps. My buddy and I looked into it and decided against it just because of the cost.  The easiest swap is probably a 13B. You have plenty of room to work with and it fits in there easily
Miata,39rpze,iRunPreMix,1 point,Sun Jun 14 19:23:40 2015 UTC,"I personally wouldn't do it because of cost, I would do it just to be different. In my opinion LS swaps are getting way out of hand. They were cool when they were new, now anybody with a checkbook can buy a kit and motor mounts. Don't get me wrong it's still a lot of effort. It's just very overdone."
Miata,39rpze,boomify,3,Sun Jun 14 03:43:39 2015 UTC,"Well 302 swaps aren't unheard of and are actually pretty common as well. If you're going to do something for being unique then I'd argue that a RB25/6 and SR20 are much more unique. The 302 is indeed a cool swap and no one will argue about the sweet sound it makes but again, for the cost an SR out of a pulsar/silvia will cost less and make the same power while having better fuel efficiency and who doesn't love the whistle of a blow off valve?  To be honest, a good turbo setup with the stock motor would be much, much cheaper and produce more power."

Miata,39u1lg,DreamingWocket,1 point,Sun Jun 14 20:41:02 2015 UTC,"Isn't the stock antenna a power antenna? Or are you talking about something different haha. I use my radio/phone for music atleast 90% of the time I'm in the car, and when I phone is plugged in it needs the antenna to be up. As opposed to down in its cave slumbering."
Miata,39u1lg,GeckoDeLimon,1 point,Sun Jun 14 21:13:01 2015 UTC,"Install a defeat switch. One of the wires on the radio wiring harness provides a 12v ""trickle"" of power when the radio is on. I think its the blue wire, but don't quote me on that. Anyway, the power antenna goes up when it senses that 12v signal. All you need to do is wire in a basic single-pole, single-throw switch that effectively ""overrides"" what the radio wants to do. Radio says ""antenna, go up!"" and you can be all, ""LOL no.""  I'll be performing this very mod with a radio upgrade in the next week or two. I'm extending the length of the wires involved so the switch can discreetly go in my center armrest. I'll take a couple photos along the way if anyone likes. I'll also be doing the same thing with my girlfriend's Integra at some point."

Miata,39sfip,AlexHYS,4,Sun Jun 14 08:42:25 2015 UTC,"I know you're set on getting the Miata, but I do see what your parents are saying. I'm not familiar with your country's market / culture for cars but it looks like you can get a brand new car for the same price as the NA. If that's really the case then I would find it difficult to choose the Miata. But I don't like spending money so that is just my opinion. I'd rather put my money towards something brand new than 20 years old if I was going to spend it in this case.  For the clutch it depends on how long you're in traffic. It's not bad if you're not in traffic for more than a half hour or hour. Longer than that and you'll probably get tired.  The Miata is pretty easy to work on but there is a lot more to it. Do you have the tools to work on the car? A nice socket set and a good hydraulic jack and jack stands are required at minimum. Do you have a place to do the work? Do you have the time / willingness to set aside half your day to do work and live without a car if something goes wrong? Can you get the parts and will they be affordable? If no, then you may be better off spending your money on the new car and getting a Miata later.   The engine will be fine with those numbers if it was maintained. The question is whether you are able and willing to do the maintenance required for some of the larger items if they need to be replaced. Clutch, convertible top, timing belt, etc. That is why I think a new car is a good choice here - you do not have to worry about that stuff if you have a limited budget."
Miata,39sfip,Spitfire24,2,Sun Jun 14 09:45:09 2015 UTC,"I have a lot of family in Malaysia and I am originally from Singapore.   The miata is a great car for city use becuase you can squeeze into pretty much any spot in traffic and for parking. The clutch is quite light so it's not too bad for traffic. The only concern would be that the A/C is not the best becuase it's r12 and I know how hot and humid it can get, but if you are used to it, it's ok. R134 conversions are very easy and most people find it works really well.  The reliably is incredible even on in a 20 year old engine. 100k km is nothing on these cars which can easily go to 300k. One thing that might be a concern is the bushings on the suspension. These engine always seem to leak though so be prepared for that.  I think you will have to more fun in a miata than a proton. And the miata will probably more reliable too."

Miata,39qi65,cdude,1 point,Sat Jun 13 20:17:59 2015 UTC,"Eunos (automobile):       In the late 1980s, Mazda diversified in the Japan market with the launch of three new marques. The company created Autozam, Eunos, and Ẽfini, in addition to the Mazda and Ford brands already marketed there. This experiment was ended in the mid-1990s. Some of the vehicles sold under the Eunos brand were intended to be sold in North America under the Amati brand, but due to economic conditions, largely attributed to the collapse of the Japanese asset price bubble in 1991, Amati was not launched.  From 1991 until 1998, when the Eunos dealership was integrated into Mazda locations, Citroën products were sold to Japanese buyers, as well as Mazda's Ẽfini locations.  The Eunos marque, which was the fun to drive, upscale brand compared to entry level Autozam, traditional Mazda products, and exclusive luxury brand Ẽfini. The name was derived for the ancient Greek ""eu"" meaning ""good"" and ""nos"", an abbreviation of ""numbers"" in English, meant to signify a number, or assortment, of good things. The Marque was launched in Japan with the Eunos 500 in January, 1992 and many of the vehicles created were exported to other markets.  Eunos sold the following vehicles:   1989 Eunos 100 (Mazda Familia BG platform) 1994 Mazda Lantis (Mazda CB platform) 1989 Eunos 300 (Mazda Persona MA platform) 1992–1993 Eunos 500 (Mazda Xedos 6 CA platform) 1993–1996 Eunos 800 (Mazda Xedos 9/Mazda Millenia Mazda TA platform) 1990 Eunos Cargo (SS platform) 1990–1995 Eunos Cosmo (Mazda Cosmo JC platform) 1991–1993 Eunos Presso/30X (Mazda MX-3 EC platform) 1989–1996 Eunos Roadster (Mazda MX-5 NA platform) Citroen AX Citroen BX Citroen ZX Citroen Saxo     Image i     Relevant: Mazda Xedos 6 | Mazda Persona | Amati Cars   Parent commenter can toggle NSFW or delete.

Good coilovers are going to be $900+. At the very lowest, the FM VMaxx Classic set is around $700. They are questionable shocks, but at least Flyin Miata will stand behind their products."
Miata,39tgmo,Slyons89,0,Sun Jun 14 17:41:42 2015 UTC,"V-max is nothing more than Ricelands with spring rates better suited to how much peen they suck. You pay more for the privileged of ""support"" of them standing behind garbage re-branded overpriced Chinese bullshit, and that's about it."
Miata,39tgmo,miatainkansas,1 point,Mon Jun 15 19:23:25 2015 UTC,"I don't know their warranty terms for the Vmaxx but I would bet if the shocks blew out they would get you replacements at least, and reasonably quickly if they were in stock. Probably the best $700 kit that you can buy all in one go, and they come with the NB top-hats pre-installed. That 1/2"" of extra travel is nice.  The other option would be to get re-valved Bilsteins and pick-your-rates springs from ebay or wherever. But it takes a lot of research to get the right stuff."
Miata,39tgmo,Slyons89,0,Mon Jun 15 20:46:01 2015 UTC,"V-max are not rebuildable.They are cheap cartridge inserts in cheaper threaded tubes. The low speed damping is fucking terrible, as in borderline undriveable terrible.   It really doesn't take much research to DIY, it's NB sports, allstar sleeves if you want them tight, and a springrate of choice, add NVH eliminators to taste and budget. If you want low, you need to think about something other than NB hats.   For all that you are around 500-1k+ depending on where you get stuff, new or used. You can replace a blown shock easy as pie, too. Really the only reasonable option sub 1K IMO."
Miata,39tgmo,miatainkansas,1 point,Mon Jun 15 21:19:36 2015 UTC,"Well I never said anything about V-max being rebuildable. I'm just saying that I would trust the product from FM more than from ebay because if the shock blows, they will probably replace the entire shock for you and they would actually honor the warranty, vs an ebay buy of the same product where they may never honor a warranty or may take months to get you a replacement. It's obvious that you have a very low opinion of the V-Max setup, and I've never used them in order to praise or shit on them. But realize that people have different standards. I'm still running red KYB AGX adjustables with green tein springs on my Miata. By your standards, they are probably complete shit. But I think they ride fine for street use, a little rough at low speed, but they work. OP's budget is low, and I think the $700 V-Max kit is probably a decent 'starter kit' suspension for the money. Especially when compared with blown stock shocks and stock springs. There are plenty of reviews out there of people who are happy with the V-Maxx kit.  You make it sound real simple to put together a custom suspension on the cheap, but I think you may be underestimating how much you already know about miata suspensions vs. someone (no offense OP) who is new to the game and doesn't really know squat. For example, ""add NVH eliminators to taste and budget"". Sure, easy for you, but consider the beginner, right? What exactly is an NVH eliminator that you could add on? Do you mean better bump stops? Helper springs? Bushings?"
Miata,39tgmo,Slyons89,-1,Mon Jun 15 21:45:38 2015 UTC,"You're right, a good several days of reading, mostly looking at pictures, before making a well informed thousand dollar plus purchase is just too much to ask. It's much better to spend double on cheap Chinese parts because the vendor might possibly be able to replace them if they feel like it at some point in the future.  Nothing of the fact you could buy two sets of ricelands for the price of the v-max, either.   Thanks for assuming I'm some kind of suspension guru, too!"
Miata,39tgmo,miatainkansas,3,Mon Jun 15 22:22:02 2015 UTC,Well now you're just being a jackass. Remember OP's $600 budget? I was just trying to make a good suggestion for a pre-built kit close to his price range.

Miata,39tgmo,iRunPreMix,1 point,Sun Jun 14 21:20:14 2015 UTC,"Well their max lowering height is 2 inch for the NA, and I think 2.5 for the nb. So it'll do that and definitely out perform stock.  If you ever want to take it autocrossing or mountain roads, they'll be great.  The reason they are much cheaper is because they started make them out of steel instead if aluminum.  Bit heavier, but a great performing coilover for the price imo.  Especially if you arent trying to be extremely competitive."

Miata,39tgmo,jesusrambo,3,Sun Jun 14 19:28:51 2015 UTC,"My one rule for going cheap is to omit two key things: Suspension and brakes. Load your car up with as much fleabay shit as you please, but brakes and ride quality are the two things that you should really, really take seriously.  eBay rotors are fine, but get quality pads. If you aren't going too low, SOME eBay springs are fine paired with the stock shocks."

Miata,39q6bp,cluggy,3,Sat Jun 13 17:58:50 2015 UTC,That plug doesn't look that bad. How do you know it's the rings?
Miata,39q6bp,higgimonster,-8,Sat Jun 13 18:57:05 2015 UTC,Because all that slimey black shit is oil. Only time oil gets in the cylinders is with worn rings.
Miata,39q6bp,raybrant,7,Sat Jun 13 19:16:07 2015 UTC,Thats very incorrect. There are many other ways for oil to get into the combustion chamber and onto the plugs. Leak down/compression test is how you will know if the rings are gone.
Miata,39q6bp,Griffin-dork,3,Sat Jun 13 20:20:49 2015 UTC,Yeah I did a leak down and it looks like it's the rings unfortunately
Miata,39q6bp,GalenCox,3,Sat Jun 13 20:23:39 2015 UTC,Or valve guides.
Miata,39q6bp,higgimonster,3,Sat Jun 13 19:28:22 2015 UTC,Leak down test confirms it's bottem end.
Miata,39q6bp,higgimonster,2,Sat Jun 13 19:41:00 2015 UTC,What if you had a bad pcv? That would suck oil in. Or valve seals?   With worn rings wouldn't you get excess blow -by?    I'm just guessing here.
Miata,39q6bp,dumkopf604,2,Sat Jun 13 19:51:52 2015 UTC,I'm open to all advice! Pcv valve seems to be working fine and it's only on one cylinder which makes me think a bad pcv valve would be affecting all 4.
Miata,39q6bp,dumkopf604,1 point,Sat Jun 13 19:56:49 2015 UTC,And yes there's blow-by. I'm going put cylinder 1 at top dead centre and let some tranny fluid soak in the spark plug hole overnight. If the rings are just gummed up and stuck this might free them up (fingers crossed anyway!)

Miata,39q6bp,the_paco,1 point,Sun Jun 14 00:29:38 2015 UTC,"yeah so I thought that too, and I've heard that can happen on cylinder 1. took the old gasket off, nothing out of the ordinary from what I could see and I couldn't see any signs of oil dripping down the spark plug hole. new plugs, leads gasket etc. same problem. that plus the leak down test has me thinking 99% gummed up piston rings. no smoking at all so from what I've read it's not the oil control rings.   out of curiosity, would a new valve cover gasket simply solve that if that was the problem? and thanks for your suggestion, I wish it was just that :("
Miata,39q6bp,UhOhPoopedIt,1 point,Sun Jun 14 00:40:18 2015 UTC,"Yes it would solve it if it was just that.  You could just redo this piston rings, they really aren't that hard to do.

Miata,39rt1m,juniorskt,1 point,Sun Jun 14 03:19:39 2015 UTC,"The 6MT will fit, but you'll need the matching driveshaft too. The transmission is longer than the 5MT."
Miata,39rt1m,Sir_not_sir,1 point,Sun Jun 14 03:27:05 2015 UTC,"I believe you are mistaken, the driveshaft is interchangeable.   Only a starter bolt doesn't line up, the six uses two where the 5 uses three. The wiring for neutral and reverse lights needs to be custom spliced.   Six speed in place of a 1.6 5 speed will suck, if you don't need the extra strength of the 6 you are better off staying with a cheaper 5 speed. They generally shift better, and it will rev less on the highway for a given speed."
Miata,39rt1m,miatainkansas,1 point,Sun Jun 14 04:00:46 2015 UTC,So if not going to add power to it stick to 5speed? But will it be more reliable or doesn't matter
Miata,39rt1m,iRunPreMix,2,Sun Jun 14 04:12:50 2015 UTC,Don't listen to Kansas. Just stick to a 5 speed because people want too much money for the 6. The 6 involves a lot more shifting and is generally just 'more fun' to drive IMHO... the 5 is much more suitable for city driving... In terms of highway they're about the same. 4k RPM in the 6speed is I think 80mph and it's preeeeeeetty much the same in the 5.  I have both.

Miata,39qq8l,CalebMars,3,Sat Jun 13 20:54:39 2015 UTC,See if you can grab a set of OEM Hollowspokes and a set of Dunlop Direzza ZII's in 185/60-R14. It should be much cheaper and it will still be at stock offset. The RPF1's are nice but is the 1lb of unsprung weight worth the extra $700?
Miata,39qq8l,STICH666,1 point,Sat Jun 13 22:33:57 2015 UTC,"RPF1s are pretty damn expensive, but most of their allure is visual.  I'm really drawn to this look.  Lowered an inch or so on 15s, with a little bit of a chunkier tire.  Why do you suggest sticking with the OEM wheel and tire size, other than price?"
Miata,39qq8l,STICH666,2,Sat Jun 13 23:31:32 2015 UTC,I personally like the look. Nobody expects a car that looks stock to embarrass higher end sports cars on an exit ramp.
Miata,39qq8l,jjjenningsiii,2,Sat Jun 13 23:57:52 2015 UTC,"If you have the coin to spend, RPF1's are great..but I would skip the S. Drives.  Like the guy above me said, the direzza z2's are, in my opinion, the best street tire available in a 205/50 size.  Super sticky, but still has decent lifespan compared to the other 200tw tires.  6UL's are my personal favorite on a Miata, and they are quite a bit cheaper than the enkeis"
Miata,39qq8l,jjjenningsiii,1 point,Sun Jun 14 00:17:40 2015 UTC,What's the deal with the S. Drives? Their only real draw compared to the competition is their price.  I've heard great things about the Z2s; why do you recommend them?
Miata,39qq8l,Louros,1 point,Sun Jun 14 01:03:01 2015 UTC,"I find the Z2's to be the perfect balance of sticky + daily drivable.  I've bought 3 sets for 3 different cars and have yet to find anything else that I prefer.  They will wear out more quickly than higher TW tires, but the grip between star specs and s. drives is huge.  I wouldn't even consider s. drive's to be competition to the z2's"

Miata,39otiv,MrFotografer,1 point,Fri Jun 19 15:44:56 2015 UTC,"Banks won't usually do car loans for under $5000 because there is little financial incentive for them to do so. Also, getting caught up in a loan on such an old, inexpensive car generally isn't the best thing to do as a consumer. If you're stretching your dollars to pay for the car, this implies you will have a hard time doing the repairs and maintenance that comes with buying a car of this age.

I have to park outside in the elements, is the soft top a problem with this? It would have to be my only car, don’t have driveway space for an extra car I’m learning stick I always take backroads to work (typically faster and shorter path over highway) I have preferably less than $25k to spend, I would have to sell my car (~$13,000) I don’t know much about how to diagnose advanced engine+transmission troubles in cars, and neither do my family. I can do regular maintenance, how easy is it to, for example change sparkplugs, change oil, brakes/rotors, etc on a Miata? I know in some cars, you have to remove parts of the engine/related components for access to sparks."
Miata,39otiv,MrFotografer,2,Mon Jun 15 17:04:22 2015 UTC,"1) With proper precaution (snow tires are pretty much a must) the Miata will do fine in the winter. Is it ideal? No. Will it handle it? It can.  2) It can be. Having a pile of snow on a soft top can be kind of a pain.  3) Miatas are one of the greatest cars to learn stick on because they are one of the greatest cars to drive stick on.  4) Old Miatas are cheap, so they fit your budget.  5) If you buy one that has been reasonably maintained, the chances of having catastrophic failures is relatively low. Miatas are extremely well-built cars. This is why many NAs on this page look like five year old cars when they are easily four times that old, and have hundreds of thousands of miles on them.  6) Regular maintenance is about as simple as it gets on a modern car (coming from the perspective of owning an NA. Minus changing the oil filter. That's usually kind of a bitch."

Miata,39mu92,chemistre,7,Fri Jun 12 21:54:58 2015 UTC,"So my NC is pretty much a garage queen, like many of them are. 3 years old and 22,000 miles, all summer and pretty much all dry also. The car was spotless, I took pretty darn good care of it. No one had ever put a finger on the paint.   My son is home from college and we needed him to have a car to get back and forth to work. He's really good with it. In this accident he was stopped in his lane for a left-turning vehicle. The woman in a Nissan Versa was texting and he said he watched her in the rear view mirror, eyes completely down and she just managed to glance up at the last moment before plowing into him. The force of the impact pushed him into the car in front of him, damaging the front bumper also.   Her airbags went off and she was taken to the hospital. Fortunately she has owned up to being fully responsible for the accident and All-State was surprisingly quick. We're told that they are not usually this responsive or willing to repair the car back to new. Usually they'll give crap about depreciation, not putting on OEM parts, not paying for a rental car etc. However they did all of that so far.  Total estimate is $6,500 right now but we'll see. The top seems to still work OK, and the car still drives totally straight but I have to check it out fully before I'll sign off on the repairs. The biggest bitch, apparently, is matching the pearl paint.  Oh and the fact that now I have a CarFax accident on the car is going to mean it is harder to sell if we ever choose to do that.   http://imgur.com/a/OrSJi#0  First three pics are of the damage.

Miata,39nc7j,Nopethefuckout94,1 point,Sat Jun 13 14:01:28 2015 UTC,It is the seats from what I've seen are a mesh support type deal like beach chairs. The center console is narrower. The door panel is narrower and the space under the steering wheel is higher. So in theory a six foot two guy like myself that is tall in the legs and a wide body should fit.

So in conclusion more head/leg room and power equals cheap interior and ridiculous insurance rates. I text my agent at state farm to quote me.

If it was me, I would just redo the entire transmission fluid change especially if there is some gunk that might have gone into the transmission.  I just did my transmission fluid change about a week or two ago.  I do recall the pump, if you bought something similar to this, being kinda difficult to get the hose into the fill port and when I was pumping the pump the height of the bottle plus the pump made it awkward to actually press down on the pump due to the car's chassis was kind of in the way.  I also did a mistake of not putting in a washer for the drain plug and had to decide to either keep the fluid in which was full by then or remove the drain plug and place the washer and lose all the newly added transmission fluid.  I decided it was better to have a ""correct"" install of the drain bolt with the washer and just bought new transmission fluid."

Miata,39kvri,sunlit_lightbulb,2,Fri Jun 12 18:43:46 2015 UTC,I just did my brake line as well.  https://www.flyinmiata.com/fm-jack-adapter.html  I got the tool above and use the pinch right under the side mirrors as jacking point. I was able to use it and jack one side of the car at a time with no problem. Pretty sure you can use it on other cars as well.  As for the placement of the jack stand. Look for the 4 reinforced jacking point right behind the two front wheel and before the rear wheel. Put your hand behind the jacking point you should feel some ripple. That's where you put your jack stand.   But be careful not to slam your ass in the seat if you have to sit in your car again after it is placed on jack stands. You can bent the jacking point if you sit on it too hard.

It's a U shaped thing that fits over the arm and a screw pushes on the joint shaft.  Pickle forks were fine when suspension parts were made of steel and cast iron.

The regular car guy put it better in his second miata review: https://youtu.be/mZEVLQQ7uEc   I think the daisy's suit it.  And I don't think we should shy away from the femininity of the miata. I think that's one of the reasons it stands out even next to newer cars,  it has a different style and look and catches your eye and transfixes you because it goes against the standard of manly man muscle and hard edges and testosterone.

Miata,39krdi,Slyons89,1 point,Fri Jun 12 16:52:15 2015 UTC,"Going back to stock on my 1.6 from a pod filter flattened out the torque curve and made the car easier to drive. When you put on a pod filter, you lose the hemholtz resonator, which helps even out a dip around 2800 RPM in my experience. The stock intake also provides more than enough airflow for a naturally aspirated car, and it already draws air from a cooler location than the pod filter kits.  I did like the growl of the pod filter, but it won't gain you any horsepower and hurts the drive-ability. You can drill holes in your stock airbox to get a louder growl, but that will draw in more hot air like the pod filter will."

The timing belt/water pump change has been well documented several times, a quick google search will bring you to them. Also search for ""miata king timing belt"" on youtube. He has a lot of good diy videos. As far as tools go, flyin miata sells a timing belt tool kit with a special wrench, crank/cam seal installers, and a ""gear ninja"" to help make the install easier, but it's not necessary."
Miata,39lbde,brandocommando29,1 point,Fri Jun 12 19:45:34 2015 UTC,"Timing belt job should be easy enough with 2 people, and without the special tools. I did it myself without the tools; just a set of sockets, breaker bar, and a bit of oomph; alone. Not very fun, at all, without someone helping. Just be very careful, and don't be too quick to remove the seals. If you get any sort of frustrated at all with them while you're trying to remove them, walk away from it. Have a beer. Clean the interior. Go back to it.   Radiator cap, thermostat, timing belt kit (belt, crank seal, cam seals, some O rings), water pump, antifreeze, distilled water (not required, but I used it because science), two big adjustable wrenches and a vice grip (to hold the cams in alignment), the correct sockets (deep and shallow of both, and a bendy-adapter, whatever it's called), and LABELS FOR EVERYTHING. This was part of my initial frustration. I forgot where a bunch of stuff went when I walked away.   This could take five hours, it could take two days of work. Just depends mostly on how much you know before you tackle the job. Look up the timing belt instructions on miata.net, they're thorough and excellent. Find videos. Show all this stuff to your friend; watch them together. Watch them separately. Put all the tools you'll need in one toolbox/bag. Keep them there. Keep them in order. This was another issue; not knowing exactly where the tools were at the time I needed them.   Pads are cheap. Rotors aren't too bad. Tires are a difficult choice, but there are very cheap options, and there are very high performance options. Don't have the money? Cheap out. Nobody's gonna make fun of you for it. Calipers, though? I dunno. Find a used set. I don't have much advice for those, haven't looked into 'em, really.   What else... hm. If you have the 14"" wheels, try and find some 15""s. Better tire selection. At those sizes, they're both gonna be cheap, but you'll have better luck finding some higher performance ones in the 15"" market.   Oh! And get a second mechanic/shop to look at the car. Preferably an independent shop. Chain shops love to tear people apart for this type of repair. Sometimes they just tack on every little thing to a timing belt job, and they'll claim it's required maintenance just because Mazda suggested it. I say nuts to that. The time intervals are often great; for inspecting the parts. Changing them? Sometimes yes, sometimes no way.   Good luck."
Miata,39lbde,69th,2,Sat Jun 13 02:43:55 2015 UTC,"Well you definitely don't want to lose coolant and overheat. That can destroy your engine. If you can figure out where it's leaking from and just fix that until you can fix the rest, that would be best. When I bought mine it would steam after a long drive. I found it leaking from the radiator (the rad was brown and cracking on top). The radiator is really simple to change yourself. Definitely don't pay a shop to do something like change the radiator cap..."

You can also find them on ebay from the same company, double check there for price differences.   you'rs is Vinyl / PVC.

Miata,39fzuo,red_door,5,Thu Jun 11 19:43:48 2015 UTC,"Lets see, this is just stage 1.  Started with a 93 chassis. Removed all the wiring, interior, windshield, brake dust shields, power steering, a/c, emissions system, bumper cores, pass. door reinforcement. door, gutted the hood and trunk lids I then custom wired the stock 1.6 with an Megasquirt 1 ecu and added ARP wheel studs, revalved koni's and 700/400lb/in springs, a tubular front sway bar, 13x7's shod with hoosiers, hood pins front and rear and a hard dog roll bar(the wrong roll bar, but that's another story). This worked for a pair of events, but not well. On the second event I blew up the 1.6 diff.   Afterwards I did a coolant reroute, added a torsen diff, sold the 13x7's, bought some 13x10's(but I dont' have any rubber for them yet) and did some rewiring to make it more water proof(since I had to go into the wiring anyway to deal with the reroute). This is just the first event as a shakedown, hence the super crappy tires on the daisy wheels. Sunday the car ran much  better than the first two events."

Miata,39g9vs,SilFourty,5,Thu Jun 11 18:48:34 2015 UTC,Shouldn't that go on the front?
Miata,39g9vs,coto94,3,Thu Jun 11 16:02:29 2015 UTC,"Diff issues aside, it depends.  Do you want unequal braking in the front, or unequal traction when accelerating?"
Miata,39g9vs,EntroperZero,2,Thu Jun 11 18:58:39 2015 UTC,"For what it's worth, (not a great deal cos, like, who am I anyway?) I agree. I would be even more concerned about using a space-saver spare on the front of a FWD car - since those two wheels are doing all of the work - but on a Miata, I would put the space-saver on the rear for exactly the reasons that you and GeckoDeLimon said. I'd rather be able to stop in a hurry than take off in one."

Miata,39g9vs,coto94,3,Thu Jun 11 16:17:06 2015 UTC,"I deleted my reply. This is one of those ""can o worms"" issues. But I found this on an old Miata.net forum post (emphasis added on the key info):   Of all of the traction aiding differentials, the Torsen is least disturbed as the wheel to wheel loads are partially carried by the helical gears and partly by the axial thrust of the side and element gears against the differential unit housing. Sometimes a clutch (washer) is included here. This clutch action is more durable (no clutch disk wear items like a Kaaz) and these axial loads do not directly carry the axle loads, only control the rotation of helical gear components which in turn provide the wheel torque. And, the unit is more concerned with torque than speed, so easy driving does not stress the unit to the point of a clutch LSD.  The best policy is to avoid putting the smaller spare on the drive axle, if you are concerned about such things. Personally, I would put the spare on the rear wheel (and this is the Torsen I paid for and I will have to replace) and drive it home. Even several hundred miles at (modest) highway speeds. I would not expect any problems. However, I would stop just 1 inch short of recommending this as a regular practice."
Miata,39g9vs,GeckoDeLimon,0,Thu Jun 11 16:21:31 2015 UTC,"If it's the same diameter no harm done, but if it's smaller overall it puts a lot more stress on the diff"

It's a well made device, and seems more reliable than the purpose-built dash cams, from everything I've read.  Just make sure to get the wide angle lens (wider than the ""regular"" one, which is already kind of wide)."

I just bought a Koonlung/Spy Tec K1S though since I wanted to upgrade to a dual-camera setup, and considering I'm planning on buying a Miata soon, I wanted a dashcam that can be hidden away somewhere just in case somebody slashes the top and breaks in.

It's less than 10 bucks and it mounts it cleanly to the mirror so you can run the wire under the windshield trim

Miata,39hy73,iRunPreMix,2,Sun Jun 14 20:01:42 2015 UTC,"That's something that you can leverage... It's about to be due for a whole mess of scheduled maintenance. Don't listen to him if he says it's done unless he's got the paperwork to prove it.   It's gonna need timing, complete fluid changes, if that's the original soft top it probably won't last much longer. It's a great looking car and seems like it's in awesome shape, but the time to keep it that way is almost upon it.   edit: and this is something universal.

The cup holders are too small for anything larger than a 12 ounce can, meaning most bottles and travel mugs won't fit. Even if you find a travel mug with a small enough base to fit, it gets in the way to shifting.

My pick would be a Nardi (check forums and FB buy/sell groups) for a nice second hand one maybe.  Failing that I've been really liking Momo Prototipo's lately (thanks to all these sexy Porsche 911 builds popping up lately) which are a lot cheaper brand new than Nardi and cheaper again second hand.

Miata,39amlb,PrintError,1 point,Wed Jun 10 14:03:53 2015 UTC,"It's a BendPak ""Ranger"" Quick Jack, the 3500lb model - http://www.bendpak.com/Shop-Equipment/QuickJack/"
Miata,39amlb,PrintError,2,Wed Jun 10 14:08:22 2015 UTC,"BTW you can get them from Summit Racing.  Usually they are in stock there, i believe it was around $900 delivered.  It's awesome for doing maintenance, oil changes, tire changes, upgrades, etc.  Stores away nicely into the corner of the garage too.  I wanted Max Jack system, but I doubt the concrete pour in my garage is good enough to safely support the lifting posts."
Miata,39amlb,DashingSpecialAgent,1 point,Wed Jun 10 14:15:03 2015 UTC,I just saw this comment as well. For $900 Im really wanting to just get it now. will make working on my cars so much easier. All 3 cars I own are really low and getting them onto jack stands is a massive pain in the ass. Takes me at least half an hour just to get the car in the air. My garage is also really small so this would help immensely and make me work on my car a lot more rather than constantly putting it off lol.   I have a gravel driveway as well and sometimes have to work on it. I could just lay some plywood down and put this lift on the plywood and just work in my driveway just fine.

Miata,39amlb,Nopethefuckout94,1 point,Wed Jun 10 14:53:29 2015 UTC,They are surprisingly light. You can easily move them with one arm. The newer versions like I have here have rollers at the ends so you can roll them around.

Miata,39drr8,DogBiscuit7,2,Thu Jun 11 02:04:36 2015 UTC,"You either loose hydraulic fluid or have occasional trouble getting into/out of gear, generally as soon as you start the car and try to get out of gear the first time or two. If it hits either point it's downhill fast, usually.   Both are less than $50 new, and if you eat ~$12 in core charges you can usually rebuild the old ones yourself for less than $20 as spares, if the bores are jacked up send them back."

I recently rebuilt my shifter because I was having issues shifting into first when rolling down a hill (less than 10mph). It worked great but it's starting to feel like before. Sometimes it feels as if something is blocking my shift pattern.   It's somewhat disappointing since shifting is a big part of a manual car.   Could this definitely be the slave/master?  Edit: Also, how come 949 racing has a slave cylinder for $14? Is it not the complete part or what. I was looking into buying their clutch hydraulic overhaul kit ($79)"

Miata,39drr8,SilFourty,1 point,Thu Jun 11 03:00:14 2015 UTC,With my experience when my car would not go into gear it was the slave. But i replaced both.
Miata,39drr8,funnythebunny,1 point,Thu Jun 11 02:59:39 2015 UTC,"bad slaves are easy to spot; pull back on the rubber and see if it's wet in there.  The master is a little harder, as most leaks occur internally, with no exterior signs of failure.  It's economical to do both yourself instead of paying a mechanic for something so simple.  Just follow the pre-bleeding instructions for both master and slave before you install them in the car."

Miata,39b227,Miata_Man,8,Wed Jun 10 15:47:24 2015 UTC,"Normally, you would try to catch this early, before it spreads too much.  Lightly sand the edges of the peeling areas, just to get rid of the loose clear coat.  Then spray on touch-up clear coat.  Honestly though, with this much damage, just plastidip it.  You should still sand the edges of the peeling areas, or your dip will start peeling in those areas.  Put down at least 4 good coats, preferably 5 so that it's easy to remove when you're ready for new paint."
Miata,39b227,EntroperZero,4,Wed Jun 10 15:51:15 2015 UTC,"sand it down primer it then plastidip it. If you treat the prep like your going to paint it, it will come out looking good."

Miata,39b227,69th,2,Wed Jun 10 19:59:51 2015 UTC,Maybe sand it down as best you can with some 1000 grit and then spray it with some cheap clear coat? Might look okay for a while.

Miata,39b227,cdude,2,Thu Jun 11 00:09:35 2015 UTC,"Sand the clear coat off, you'll definitely accidentally sand off the base coat while doing it, but as long as you don't go past the primer down to bare metal, you'll be ok. Then the cheapest would be to find a duplicolor base coat and clear coat at your local store. The color will be poorly matched and the clear coat will be bad. But it'll last you one or two years. One step up would be to get the paint mixed and put in aerosol cans from any auto paint store, use their recommended clear coat. Use 2k CC if you have the money. You can get better result if you have a high CFM compressor and a decent harbor freight spray gun. That's the closest you'll get to a professional respray, for cheap.  Or you can just do a $300 macco respray and live with a mediocre job."

Miata,39b227,Troybylt,2,Wed Jun 10 18:05:57 2015 UTC,"Single stage paint will still see cracking,  except you'll see bare metal or primer instead of the base coat. All paints can get shitty,  and we know Mazda didn't really do good qc on the miatas paint job.  The earlier ones were single stage and that sucked,  and you see peeling clear coat on miatas all the time.  A good paint job will last no matter what. A bad one will fail."

Miata,39d48e,miatainkansas,1 point,Wed Jun 10 23:52:45 2015 UTC,"Try adjusting the clutch at the top of the pedal, that's how you move the grab point. You need to read about it though, if you do it wrong the clutch won't fully disengage locking it in gear or it will slightly slip if it's not allowed to release all the way on the opposite end of the adjustment.   Chatter can be the transmission being misaligned with the driveshaft and PPF. There's a spec for distance the transmission should be off the frame rails, if it's too low or high it will give bad driveline angles. It also might be the clutch bedding itself in still, if they surfaced the wheel it will need a sec to match to the new disc.  What does a stage one clutch look like? Impossible question to answer, but I'm still curious. Compare the pressure plate fingers to pictures of stock clutches, are they wider? That's where all the weight on the pedal comes from."
Miata,39d48e,miatainkansas,1 point,Thu Jun 11 01:32:40 2015 UTC,"I'm aware about adjusting the pedal, tried it a few hours ago. No dice while it's raining.  I called them back to ask about the difficulties and the owner who races his NA who apparently also has the 1.8 to 1.6 swap confirmed what I had experienced.  I just don't get how the pedal feel changed from when I bought the car to when it seemed like the clutch was going.  Was nice and heavy then it got lighter and lighter the more miles I'd drove.  I'm taking it back tomorrow so they can adjust the pedal with me there. IIRC a stage one clutch looks the same but can handle more torque.  Stage two and beyond start to look interesting with pucks rather than a disc."

They've been good to me in the past, but I still am wary of chain shops in general. The passenger rear was toed in a bit when I brought it in, and not sure what it looks like now. For all I know about it, it could have been bent around a tree before I got it and cosmetically fixed.

Two birds one bowl of rice.
Miata,39e4g7,Mr_Noobert,2,Thu Jun 11 04:41:30 2015 UTC,"Seems like you don't really want a miata then. That missing 700 would have gone a long way towards purchasing or modifying the car the way you want. Like others here, I suggest saving. Spend that time learning and planning. By the time you make the plunge you will have a much better plan and probably have found a better deal than what the dealers might offer."
Miata,39e4g7,skidude2000,1 point,Thu Jun 11 19:39:01 2015 UTC,Fair enough I'll give it a go and try saving. I found where the seven hundred went at least. My bank was mad at me so I cashed two checks at Walmart and spent the money to get my current pos running again. How the fuck I forgot something like that I don't know? I guess I repressed it because I'm pissed that it broke down again and just wanted to forget about it.
Miata,39e4g7,skidude2000,2,Thu Jun 11 19:48:36 2015 UTC,"I'll answer point #2 first. Which generation depends on only two things:  How much money you want to spend on it, and which you like better. If you want the cheapest, chances are you'll be looking at NAs, second cheapest NBs, etc. After that, it all comes down to taste. I personally really like the look of the NA, what with the popup headlights and smaller size. Sure, I could say they weigh less than an NB or NC, but honestly that's a negligible point as all the generations are fun (from what I've read, I've only ever driven an NA).  So I'd say decide that first. For point #1: If you like the NCs and go for one, you'll have an easier time fitting than an NA, because the cars just got a bit bigger with each generation (the NDs notwithstanding). But if you really like the NAs, there are tall people mods you can do. Just realize going in that the earlier the car, the more mods you will have to do to fit. Also, the dude I bought my NA from was about your size and said he never could really get comfortable in it so that's why he sold it. If you like NAs, try to find meets or something where there are other tall folks that drive them and start up a chat. Chances are they'll let you try fitting in their car. If that's not an option, just sit in an NA or test drive one to get an idea of how much you'll have to mod.  Super vs. Turbo is something I can't speak to much since I haven't done either. What I have heard is that if you want linear power delivery, get a supercharger. If you want potential for more power in general, albeit delivered later in the rev range and more at once, go for a snail. Someone else that knows more about the subject would be better off telling you about it, though. I have no idea, lol. Never did that on mine."
Miata,39e4g7,aywwts4,-4,Thu Jun 11 04:11:57 2015 UTC,Alrighty then thanks for your help I mean it. I really like NA 1.8 so 94-97. I'll just have to test drive if I can fit. Speaking of which what would the tall people mods entail? Bucket seats bolted directly to frame with no adjustment rail? That's what I'm thinking. If I can fold myself like a lawn chair in the seat I sit alot lower. I have long legs so it screwed me out of buying a geo metro off a buddy not too long ago. Now I have a pos 96 Saturn sl2 4speed auto. Such hate many dislike. I just love ricer miatas so dope imho. FYI I'm not about that stance life. Fuck that. I'm going to stick around this sub check out what others are doing and what not to get more info.
Miata,39e4g7,69th,1 point,Thu Jun 11 04:39:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah, lower seats directly bolted in is one option.  There's also the foamectomy option for stock seats, visor delete, door handles replaced with straps (to avoid knees hitting), etc. There are a few others I've seen, search around this sub and the miata.net forums. I'm short so I never personally had to do these.  Also, forgot you mentioned dealership and saw the other guy's comment. You really are better off getting some money in the bank before doing this, especially if you plan on any kind of motorsport involvement. Things can go very wrong when you put that kind of stress on a vehicle, especially one that's 20 years old. And plan on spending money on parts, guaranteed. If you don't have money for parts and the bank owns the car, you're setting yourself up for trouble.  EDIT: Also, if you go for it, don't try to cut corners for a turbo or super. Having a blower is an expensive endeavor. Save yourself the headache of poorly made, cheap parts that will just ruin your car."

When I test drove my car the owner let me drive the balls out of it. full throttle the whole test drive. If your budget can handle it get the least mileage you can. If you're on a strict budget like I was, get a good car that fits into it"
Miata,3946eb,djchexxx,1 point,Tue Jun 9 03:26:22 2015 UTC,"I'm usually a mileage whore when buying a used car, I always look for the lowest mileage when buying used.  However the Miata is the only used car that I've bought twice with really high mileage, my first was a '94 with a supposed 131k on the clock, but I'm pretty sure that it had its odometer rolled back and that there was about 200k on it. My current '90 had 158k on the clock when I bought it, and I was able to verify that from the previous owners service records.      I always link to this page when talking about high mileage on this sub.  It's a great example of how far a well engineered, front engine-rear wheel drive car can travel over its life when maintained properly (hell, sometimes even not maintained properly)."
Miata,3946eb,murica_ftw,1 point,Tue Jun 9 15:26:00 2015 UTC,"You just gotta make sure it runs well and has at least some documentation of oil changes.  In my experience the only issue with high miles is the piston rings get stuck or gummed up which causes pretty bad oil consumption.  But even then, if you can live with buying a gallon of oil every month you'll be fine.  My motor hits redline nearly everyday and I just buy T6 which is like 21 bucks a gallon.  Old motor did the same thing, swapped it because the consumption was bothering me and the ""new"" to me motor is worse.  So I just don't care anymore.  Original had ~250k on it if you're curious."

Miata,39214q,shutterlindsey,2,Fri Jun 12 04:13:54 2015 UTC,"As someone strongly looking into those wheels, could you give us the specs on your wheels/tires please? How do they hold up during autox, and do you drive the car on the street as well?"
Miata,39214q,jjjenningsiii,2,Mon Jun 8 20:48:56 2015 UTC,"Well firstly, do you know what wheels they are? All i knew is they are 7x15 and a guy who used to autox his miata sold them to me for $100.there is no brand stamp that I see anywhere on the wheels...  as for specs I have the Dunlop Direzza ZII Star Spec, 205/50 R15. Ideally I wanted 225 width but i couldn't get them. I don't remember if they where sold out or just don't make that size, but I had to get 205. I figured 205 with a known good tire is better than 225 in a less good tire.   as for how things hold up, they are great, both the wheel and the tires. I love them at autocross the tires have awesome grip and I'm really happy with them. Some people are going RE-71R's and I have them on my other autocross car (subaru STI) but the cars handle so different I couldn't tell you which is better. I do daily the miata but only during the summer and only if it isn't going to rain. However, i live in the desert so winter last 2 months and it rains a total of 30 to maybe 40 days all year. which means lots of miata time!  for durability I have had the wheels over a year and they where used before that by someone else for an unknown amount of time. i see no cracking, damage, etc. so they are great. The tires have about 10 auto-x sessions, at around 8 runs a session, and a time attack under them along with DD'ing for about 5 months and they still have lots of life left. I expect to get about a year out of them considering there's another 10 auto-x races and 4 time attacks to go this year.  in conclusion, these wheels and tires are great and would recommend both. but like i said, no idea who made the wheels haha."

Miata,392jtk,tpwalsh,2,Mon Jun 8 20:57:08 2015 UTC,I bought mine 2nd hand so yup... it runs into boost at about 3000 rpm pulls about 4.5 lbs of boost. I have to look into base timing. And when the car comes up to running temp and it is above 80 degrees outside. I'll drive around to get a more accurate temp

What's the emissions laws in your county/state? What's your budget for fixing this? What's the Air/Fuel ratio when under load and boost?(Wideband) What's the timing like under the same conditions?   1 gives you a list of tools that you currently have to use to compensate for this issue. #2 and #3 lets you know what tools you CAN use. #4 and #5 lets you know how bad this engine management issue really is.   Answer those, and you'll be well on your way to boosted freedom instead of detonation purgatory."
Miata,392jtk,Sir_not_sir,2,Mon Jun 8 22:25:37 2015 UTC,I took it to a tuning shop. They think that my front O2 sensor is bad. I'm going to replace it and take it back to them afterwards and if that doesn't fix it they are going to build a fuel and timing card for it because it is running lean in boost. Thank you for your help.  Edit: lean under boost until 3 lbs then it runs rich.

Also, if you're saving up for a steering wheel, you may want to buy a crappy eBay one that's a similar size just to see how you'll like it first. That's what I did, and honestly, I'm loving the crappy wheel. The fake carbon fiber isn't too tacky looking, and isn't peeling yet. It's not flimsy like many people claim they are. It's got a horn button in the middle (though I do miss the silly Miata buttons!) and it's easy to put on.

Miata,390r5l,mooinakan,5,Mon Jun 8 12:13:11 2015 UTC,"a) There is a chance you won't fit, depending on how you are built. The seats in the ND are lower but do not have any adjustment for any additional lowering. If you are torso-tall there may be ways to modify the seats, called a foamectomy in prior editions, but you won't know that until after others have done that kind of surgery. If you are legs-tall, you may find the reach to the pedals slightly cramped. I'm 6;0"" and find this my main limitation - long trips can be a little uncomfortable after a few hours.  b) Don't go into this thinking about payments. If you do, you will get screwed by the dealership as they start thinking of ways to get you into a car with flexible financing... e.g. 72 months of payments, variable rate loans etc. You want to go in there with a firm idea of what you are paying and use a financial calculator to use the cost of money to figure out the payments, down payment required to get to those payments, and the length of the loan.   We need people like you (and me in 2012) to keep buying new Mazda cars so that those who can't afford new cars can buy the used ones a few years later, after all the initial depreciation is paid."

Any trim and option had a high residual value that resulted in a very low payment (Close to 300 a month for 36 months, 0 down, and in my state, a good ~50 a month in property tax savings).... but no modding fun."

Oil change, coolant flush, belts, seals, gaskets, woodruff key and new gear, diff fluid, spark plugs and wires, basically every liquid was checked, filled or flushed. It was a great way to get to know their car and gave me confidence in the car to take it to the track and autox. I bought 3 books on working on miatas to make sure i did it right and it was worth it. Each had pictures or steps or info that another didn't. I got the repair manual, a miata restoration manual and a miata performance projects manual. If you like to do it your self, buy those books and do what maintenance they recommend.   For performance and fun, buy grippy tires. The ZII star specs and RE-71Rs are both great. Tires made the largest difference for improving handeling of the car. Then do sway bar, stock body roll is baaaad, and then suspension. Shocks and coil overs. Once it handles great you can move to finding horses with full header back exaust change and then a good intake."

They are written with the average joe in mind. The repair manual assumes you know what your doing and skips a lot of steps. They will make it clear about what you need to do and how to do it.  I'm not sure what year car you have but if its a 90 or 91 go read about the NA miata short nose crank and how it fails. Basically theres a woodruff key, essentially a little metal block, that holds the sprocket ,that turns all your belts, to the crankshaft. Well it really holds it in a specific orientation, a bolt holds the sprocket in place. Anyway, that key and the slot it sits in can fail, when that happens that sprocket stops spinning and the engine dies. And if it fails fixing it is very pricy. If you have a 92 or later, forget all this about keys and sprockets and enjoy your better designed engine.   Edit, reread your post, you have a 96. So goodnews you dont have to worry about it!"
