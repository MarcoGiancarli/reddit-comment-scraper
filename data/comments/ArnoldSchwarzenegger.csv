ArnoldSchwarzenegger,3by05v,1percentwins,4,Fri Jul 3 02:21:09 2015 UTC,"I think a lot of people are coming in with opinions already made up. Its the same problem with Jurassic World.  Folks are so against the idea of reboots and sequels that they can't comprehend a reboot or sequel being decent. Granted, I completely understand why. Hollywood has burned us time and again with those. And people have shown their ability to get past that with something phenomenal like Mad Max: Fury Road.  But it's just one of those things where people have pretty much written their reviews before watching the film."
ArnoldSchwarzenegger,3by05v,Commander_Ninja,4,Fri Jul 3 05:44:29 2015 UTC,"The problem with Jurassic World wasn't that opinions were already made up. The problem was that the dialogue was terrible and painfully awkward, the plot often times made no sense, and the characters were obvious cliches. I mean it was pretty entertaining but it's shortcomings were too obvious to ignore for me, an average filmgoer (not a film-buff).  ""Me and my 10 friends loved it"" doesn't make T:G a well-made film from a critical standpoint and isn't prima facie evidence that critics' reviews are biased. I absolutely love about 90% of Arnold's filmography, but I'm not going to stand here and say that more than half of them are examples of really good film-making."
ArnoldSchwarzenegger,3by05v,DrSandbags,5,Fri Jul 3 06:22:44 2015 UTC,Fuck you Jurassic World was awesome. I'd write a thesis on it but it's late and I'm on my phone. Half in the Bag explains it well enough.
ArnoldSchwarzenegger,3by05v,Commander_Ninja,2,Fri Jul 3 08:30:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah Half in the Bag does explain it well. Jay thought it sucked, largely for some of the same reasons I did, and the other guy's response boiled down to ""Well it's not as bad as a Michael Bay movie."" And even he admits that the characters were dimensionless and the Vincent D'Orfonio subplot could have been cut."
ArnoldSchwarzenegger,3by05v,DrSandbags,3,Fri Jul 3 13:25:56 2015 UTC,"""Movie Critics"" are usually just pretentious cunts that want to be heard and the best way to be heard is be controversial or negative so you get more attention. I loved the fucking movie, critics can eat shit."

It is not often that a film comes along which not only subverts genre expectations, but in fact uses that subversion of expectations to create a disconnect between how we traditionally perceive the themes and moral imperatives inherent in the genre and what we are experiencing in the film itself. As our expectation of fulfillment of tropes takes root during viewing of a film, teasing us into aligning ourselves with certain traditional attitudes in order to grant our approval for a certain outcome, our embrace of those assumptions makes us vulnerable should anyone decide to yank the rug out from under us.   Unnecessarily wordy and academic. The author needs to learn how to get the point across concisely. It's not about dumbing it down."

They just need to pare the cast down to a manageable number (stop trying to squeeze every single action star from the 80's into), so that everyone can get some decent characterization. And, of course, a better, coherent plot. With a really compelling bad guy, someone with action chops. I'm thinking someone like Denzel Washington, or Russell Crowe (or both), maybe Jack Nicholson (if he's still acting)."

ArnoldSchwarzenegger,30b5je,Mxblinkday,1 point,Thu Mar 26 21:37:11 2015 UTC,He played a science experiment who opens a consulting business in Twins He plays a father trying to find a rare and coveted toy for his child during a madcap holiday season in Jingle All the Way He plays the worlds leading cryogenics expert in Batman & Robin He plays a normal man dealing with the ethical ramifications of cloning in The 6th Day He plays a firefighter coming to terms with the loss of his wife and child in a terrorist attack in Collateral Damage He plays a middle eastern prince in Around the World in 80 Days Pumping Iron He plays a convict attempting to escape prison in The Escape Plan   Plenty of humanizing roles :P
ArnoldSchwarzenegger,30b5je,sharkattackmiami,1 point,Sat Mar 28 19:56:01 2015 UTC,He also played a man that becomes pregnant  I'm not sure if that's a human role or not
ArnoldSchwarzenegger,30b5je,iTrollYhu,1 point,Sun Mar 29 20:27:35 2015 UTC,Ehhhhh. The closest one I would say would be Twins. The other ones he's either a killing machine/bad ass or just being funny.
ArnoldSchwarzenegger,309dlo,MattMauler,15,Wed Mar 25 15:21:51 2015 UTC,"The entire feeling of this trailer is just amazing. We have had Arnold as our total ass kicker for decades, and now we see him, struggling with the world on the edge, to one last time save his family. I for one got chills seeing Arnold looking so worn down, but still clearly capable of massive damage. Cannot wait for the release. Arnold is the MAN."
ArnoldSchwarzenegger,309dlo,Tortoise24,8,Wed Mar 25 18:44:18 2015 UTC,He does have a vulnerability to him that we've never quite seen before. I'm really happy to see him embrace his age and do something different.
ArnoldSchwarzenegger,309dlo,roger_,3,Wed Mar 25 19:56:40 2015 UTC,This is exactly why I liked the trailer too. It subverts both the tired old zombie gerne as well as Arnold the Action Hero. I hope it delivers.

Arnold's pinnacle achievement. 10/10 Author: justabloke616 from United States 24 November 2006  ""This is probably the best movie that Arnold Schwarzenegger has made (even surpassing T2), not because it has any plot development, realistic action sequences, or anything else that you would expect, but because it is HILARIOUS. The amount of laugh-out-loud moments in Commando is on par with Monty Python and the Holy Grail, Borat, and other such films. YES, it is THAT funny.  What other action movie opens with the hero and his daughter feeding a deer and licking ice cream? What other movie has lines like ""I eat green berets for breakfast. And right now I'm very hungry""? And Arnold, as John Matrix, was dodging bullets (and killing the population of a small country) long before that pussy Neo was even born.  Commando also has one of the best baddies of all time in Bennett. This man is so hard that he wears chain mail, and feeds off electric shocks. And he doesn't shoot people between the eyes, he shoots them between the balls! See this movie, you won't be disappointed."""

ArnoldSchwarzenegger,2k3309,bewmar,2,Fri Oct 24 01:23:33 2014 UTC,"That reviewer is a true hero. I especially appreciate someone else loving that ""I'm air sick"" line. Arnie complete stonefaces the acting, like, there's no emotion AT ALL as he says it to the air hostess, barging past. Something about how flimsy an excuse (to enter the back of the plane during takeoff) it is has stayed with me for years and years."

I found a clip from 2008 when he was in Columbus, Ohio for a John McCain rally.  He said he had been coming to Ohio for 40 years and even filmed movies here."

ArnoldSchwarzenegger,2hwiuc,TheJoshie,3,Wed Oct 1 00:38:07 2014 UTC,"100%. As a bodybuilder myself, I can assure you that every single professional bodybuilder is on steroids. And not just a small doses here and there, they take thousands of dollars worth each month and have to inject daily.  Edit: I don't say that to take away anything from Flex though, while he might be on juice, he absolutely trained his ass off to get to where he is."
ArnoldSchwarzenegger,2hwiuc,OneRandomCatFact,-1,Wed Oct 1 00:39:06 2014 UTC,"Really makes me sad that bodybuilders do this. It would really impress me much more to see what a human could do, naturally. This may be a dumb question, but is the movie Pain & Gain pretty realistic towards how these athletes look at life? Obviously they are not that immoral though XD"
ArnoldSchwarzenegger,2hwiuc,AquaticYetiSummit,5,Wed Oct 1 00:47:24 2014 UTC,How does it make you sad that bodybuilders take steroids? Humans can still look good naturally without steroids. There are plenty of bodybuilders who look good and don't take steroids.
ArnoldSchwarzenegger,2hwiuc,TheJoshie,2,Wed Oct 1 01:06:18 2014 UTC,"Steroids aren't the dangerous, life-ruining substances that the media portrays them to be. Used properly they have many benefits and can be quite healthy!   It's almost impossible to say what the natty limit is, there are way too many fake nattys and the drugs leave your system so fast that it's really easy to beat a drug test. Personally though, I'm very close to my natural limit. This is me after my recent cut. Hopefully that gives you an idea of the natty limit, although there definitely could be genetic freaks out there.  I have not seen that movie so I can't say, however, The Rock is definitely not natty. Also, he wouldn't make a very good bodybuilder, bodybuilders go for freaky looks, not movie star looks.   This guy(Ronnie Coleman) is generally considered to be the biggest, and best bodybuilder ever to grace the stage. That video is the essence of bodybuilding. That is what bodybuilding is all about!!  Another video for ya, this guy is probably the most aesthetic bodybuilder I've ever seen. Flex Wheeler."

ArnoldSchwarzenegger,2645r1,nkilian,7,Thu May 22 17:53:52 2014 UTC,"T2 is also my top choice for favorite Arnie movie. I grew up with this movie and it was the most incredible thing I had ever seen next to Jurassic Park.   Honorable mentions would be Predator and Commando. Predator sparked my love for the Alien and Predator movies and everything about this film was perfect: the acting, the setting, the action, all of it was amazing. Commando was the perfect 80's action film. He throws a phone booth with someone in it over his head! And the throws the same guy off of a cliff! I can easily quote the entirety of all three of these films."

It's so over the top and it doesn't take itself very seriously but it's also got the balls to not constantly remind you that you shouldn't take it seriously either (I feel like there aren't a lot of movies that do this these days)."

ArnoldSchwarzenegger,2645r1,yojumbo,3,Wed May 21 15:05:25 2014 UTC,"I would say Predator. It was the pinnacle of the 80's action movie. It was very well produced, filmed and ""acted"". The story was great and the suspense building up the reveal of the Predator was perfect. Back then the Predators thermal vision was exotic and ""alien"" to most people. All of the actors in it were manly men. Guns, muscles, military hardware, survival, and bravado. All of the makings of a classic action movie."

For me, it didn't work when it was set in the future. It kind of lost its magic as I'm used to the film being set in the past and Terminators going after John Connor. I think after Terminator 2, that's where it should have ended as Sarah's speech, right at the end, was very fitting and a good way to wrap up the series. No film in the franchise will beat Terminator 2, but we'll see what the new movie brings us, I guess."

Then she speaks into some tape recorder thingy and how she owes the luxury of her survival to the Terminator and how Judgment Day never happened and she got drunk that day. Maybe they should have used something for the theatrical ending to say that Judgment Day never happened and end the Terminator series on a high. Don't get me wrong, on its own merit, Terminator 3 was not a bad film, just never a patch on the iconic Terminator 2. Terminator and Terminator 3 need to be judged on their own. Terminator:Salvation was a poor film, imo. I'm hoping 'Genesis' improves on that dire effort."

Redoing it without him negates the movie's credibility.  Actually now that I think about it, I just wish they'd stop rebooting successful movies period.

He's around 13 years younger than Arnold and Stallone (who's only 3 years younger than De Niro!) and around the same age as Wesley Snipes, but he definitely looks like a grandad a lot more than any of them. It's not just the wool hat he's wearing (which I think gives him a bit of Burgess Meredith from Rocky vibe).  Also, I always thought Wesley Snipes was a lot shorter for some reason."

ArnoldSchwarzenegger,22g5py,McFlyMeToTheMoon,12,Mon Apr 7 19:05:24 2014 UTC,"I disagree with this article.  Arnold's strengths aren't in character development or emotional heart wrenching scenes.  His strengths are one liners and being a one man army, and he can still do that; the action scenes in The Last Stand are fantastic.  Clint Eastwood had his fair share of ""bad"" movies before Unforgiven, but Unforgiven went back to what Clint does best: badass cowboy.  He showed an aging badass cowboy, but he was still a badass cowboy.  I honestly believe that Arnold could (AND SHOULD!) do a movie like Commando again.    He'd be the retired aging elite soldier who's called back into action because his grand daughter has been abducted.  The culprit is a US Senator who wants to use this abduction as a chance to display an advanced person tracking and finding technology package to Congress so that the defense company he's affiliated with will get picked up.  Unbeknownst to the senator, the kidnappers have a legitimate grudge against Arnold because of how he utterly destroyed them in the past, so they sabotage the senator's tech as they try to use Arnold's grand daughter as ransom for the release of their leader, who was captured years ago when Arnold was active in the military.  Of course, all hell breaks loose as Arnold goes low tech with his weapons cache that he's saved up over the years and goes on a rampage following clues to find and rescue his grand daughter.  Night vision and radar tracking missiles?  Hell no, Arnold doesn't need that new high tech BS.  All he needs is a cutoff shirt, his trusty knife, a belt fed M60, grenades, and unguided rockets.  Hipster kid bad guy: ""Want to know where your grand daughter is?  We'll call you and tell you what to do."" (Throws an iPhone at Arnold). Arnold (Shoots hipster kid's hands off): ""Send me a text message.""  Arnold corners another baddie henchman: Baddie Henchman: ""Give me the gun! I'll tell you where your grand daughter is!"" Arnold (sighs and lowers his gun slightly): ""I'll give you my bullets."" (proceeds to shoot the guy).  Arnold proceeds to run all over the place, killing people every now and then, until he makes it to the bad guys' hideout where he goes off with his M60 fired from the hip.  After mowing down an entire army, Arnold confronts the last guy and they shoot at each other until they're out of bullets.  The head bad guy talks about how Arnold was set up and how the the US Senator was involved to win the government contract.  They both pull out knives and come out from cover.  Head bad guy: ""Isn't this great!? Just you and me, no guns or technology BS to end this too quickly, Grandpa!"" Arnold: ""It's past my bedtime!"" (Throws knife into Head bad guy's face)  Special forces and the US Senator arrive, classically late.  US Senator: ""Boy are we glad you're both ok!"" Arnold's granddaughter: (Punches him in the groin while someone else conveniently says ""Arrest that man! He's behind all of this!""  Arnold and grand daughter walk off into the sunset.  And that's basically it.  That's what makes a great Arnold movie that we'd all love to see."

ArnoldSchwarzenegger,22g5py,Macgyveric,3,Mon Apr 7 22:29:29 2014 UTC,"If it bombs, it would only be because peoples' tastes really have changed...the movie is essentially Commando 2 (budget $10 million, worldwide gross $57.5 million in 1986).  However, I think in time it would become one of those classics that everyone loves, just like Commando :)  It would only seal Arnold's fate as the greatest one man army cinema has ever seen.  I prefer my Arnold taking people out of this world and not bringing them into it (Junior =P)"
ArnoldSchwarzenegger,22g5py,Macgyveric,1 point,Mon Apr 7 22:53:10 2014 UTC,"Sure - Commando was a success in 1986, but the article argues that the same movie wouldn't be in today's economy in front of today's audience.  Those who love Arnold beyond any rational reason might still like it - but those same people aren't turning out for his latest action flicks, which are essentially newer, half-assed versions of his old song and dance. If Arnold wants to keep making action flicks, he's got to find something that resonates with today's audiences, and the numbers prove that what he's doing isn't working."
ArnoldSchwarzenegger,22g5py,Macgyveric,1 point,Mon Apr 7 23:03:08 2014 UTC,"I just don't think his newer movies catered to his strengths.  Every single one of his movie successes featured him as a nearly invincible one man army (Conan, Terminator, Commando, Predator, Total Recall, T2, True Lies), while his movies that didn't do well were ones that weren't as ""fun"" because he wasn't mowing people down.  His latest movies were trying to be too much like today's other action flicks; there was too much screen time for everyone but Arnold in The Last Stand, and there wasn't enough gun time for Arnold in Escape Plan (haven't seen Sabotage yet).  I think there's still a market for ultra violent cheesy slaughter fests (300: Rise of an Empire), but Arnold just needs to make that movie."
ArnoldSchwarzenegger,22g5py,Albatrosity,1 point,Mon Apr 7 23:23:33 2014 UTC,"You're right that his newer movies aren't catering to his strengths - but I think his strengths have changed - and everybody including him is just refusing to acknowledge it.  Problem with the modern ultra violent cheesefests, IMO, is that they rely heavily on CGI. Too much wire-fu and motorcycles jumping over buildings and planets exploding.  Arnold has had some success with that type of movie (Terminator franchise, for example), but I don't think the Arnold Archetype Action Hero translates well into today's CGI Action flicks - especially when there are younger, more popular, more bankable stars lining up to take the place of a 67-year-old guy.  Why would they kick off a potentially viable franchise with a guy that old? They won't, they'll go to Vin Diesel or Gerard Butler or whomever else.   I love those movies where he mows everyone down as a one-man-army also, but current Arnold isn't that guy anymore.  He's older, more vulnerable, more relatable, more human.  And nostalgia aside, audiences aren't that way anymore either. They demand either more depth or more CGI.  I prefer depth. :)"
ArnoldSchwarzenegger,22g5py,malmsteen_magic,2,Mon Apr 7 23:35:58 2014 UTC,"I don't know that it's the CGI that draws people in.  A lot of people really hated the CGI action in Star Wars.  I see it more of a tool to convey the plot for the actors.  There are younger action stars like Vin Diesel, but Vin really can't mow people down and deliver the lines the same way Arnold can; he's cheesy in his own way.  I agree though, he isn't as marketable since he's older, so maybe that's the problem.  I still think he looked good running the machine guns in The Last Stand and Escape Plan though.  Heh, I still think he's that guy.  The best part of Escape Plan was when he decided the machine gun mount was for girly men and picked it up, gave the slow motion 1000 yard stare and started mowing people down."
ArnoldSchwarzenegger,22g5py,Axius,4,Mon Apr 7 23:49:02 2014 UTC,"Does Arnold even want to make a Hollywood comeback? Between his fairly regular appearances on r/fitness, the Epic Meal Time episode, and his work with designing workout routines for fitocracy, he seems like a guy who's just taking it easy for a while and focusing on his hobbies.  I think what will happen is he'll end up like Samuel L Jackson, a fan favorite who decides to fo movies HE thinks will be fun.  It's basically retirement (maybe temporary) after a long and illustrious career."
ArnoldSchwarzenegger,22g5py,TheManWithNoNam3,1 point,Tue Apr 8 00:36:37 2014 UTC,"With the quantity of movies that Arnold has been pumping out and/or planning, he's definitely trying to stay relevant in Hollywood.  I don't think Arnold is the type of guy to sit around enjoying the fruits of his labor.  He wants to be doing stuff.  With the lack of success from his past 3 movies, he's not doing a great job at cherry-picking roles if that's what he's really going for.  I think he'll take any movie someone wants to pitch at him (a la Triplets)."
ArnoldSchwarzenegger,22g5py,TheManWithNoNam3,3,Tue Apr 8 14:33:50 2014 UTC,I'm pretty disappointed myself with the lack of commercial success Arnold's recent movies have had. I didn't go see The Last Stand because it didn't look that great but I couldn't pass up Escape Plan because of his teaming up with Stallone. Sabotage looked super interesting not from the trailers but from what I heard about it. It wasn't supposed to be just a typical actioner. I haven't been able to see it though because it doesn't seem to be playing in Canada at all.  I don't want Arnold to be in nothing but sequels. I appreciate Terminator and Conan a lot but if he could be in something like what Gran Torino did for Clint Eastwood that would be magical.
ArnoldSchwarzenegger,22g5py,Chaosdada,3,Mon Apr 7 20:17:54 2014 UTC,What he needs is a film that stops using CGI and does it the old way in a role that suits his nature. It needs big explosions and lots of guns. One liners also must exist but they need to stop writing about his age as that undermines his character as far as I have seen.  I have to say as well that I feel paired with Bruce Willis they could make an interesting action film. They would have to avoid a cop duo film though due to Willis being McClane which makes other cop roles a bit weird to see. I do think they have potential there that has been massively overlooked and should be considered.

He's got nothing to prove to anyone. This man can stand tall on his accomplishments, as far as I see it.  I've never taken any kind of performance enhancing drugs (was an athlete in college and stay fit now), but I admit that when I hit 60, I'll probably start a doctor-guided regimen of GH and whatever else has been developed by then.

If Ayer can successfully transplant Arnold's awesome charisma into a movie that resembles End of Watch even just a little bit, I think it'll be a winner.   I hope it does well at the box office as well compared to Arnold's recent movies. As much as I'm looking forward to Terminator and Conan movies, I want him to be in new properties too."

ArnoldSchwarzenegger,20nzqu,YaKoStar,2,Tue Mar 18 14:53:36 2014 UTC,"I loved the first two, and I'm a huge science fiction nut, and I have to say, I did enjoy part 3. I particularly liked the guy playing John, and the whole ""skynet was software on the internet"" twist. It's not on the same level as 2, but I found it enjoyable all the same.  Plus, come on - Arnold was in it."
ArnoldSchwarzenegger,20nzqu,funnels,1 point,Tue Mar 18 19:44:39 2014 UTC,Agreed. T3 was an fun movie to watch. Arnie holding a casket and firing a machine gun one handed? Hell yes. It had some campy parts but was overall enjoyable. The real travesty is Terminator: Salvation. That was terrible.
ArnoldSchwarzenegger,20nzqu,darkhelmet218,2,Tue Mar 18 22:16:47 2014 UTC,"That's a BIG claim,  Terminator 2 is one of my favorites films and i hope it turns better than some of the recent films."

ArnoldSchwarzenegger,1ze10s,austinisme247,1 point,Mon Mar 3 18:30:30 2014 UTC,"There have been some recent (as well as older) rumors regarding scenes from Sarah Connor's childhood being a part of the film, but not the entire film.  The reaction to that idea has been negative but I think it will probably just be a small part (I hope).  If there was a Terminator sent back to her early childhood to watch over her or something and has basically been around in the background for 30+ years then an argument could be made that the T-800's flesh would age over time.    Why didn't that T-800 intervene in T1 and T2, who knows.  But my theory is the only logical argument as far as how or why a T-800 looks so fucking old."
ArnoldSchwarzenegger,1ze10s,Wake_up_screaming,1 point,Wed Mar 19 19:05:24 2014 UTC,"I mean he doesn't look that old. It's not like Clint Eastwood trying to take the roll of terminator or something.  Don't get me wrong, he's more wrinkley and is losing his hair a little bit but he is still ripped so I think with lots of make up and lighting, they might be able to pull it off. His recent muscle mag photo shoot is evidence of the power of lighting and make up, plus it shows he still has the physique."

There are sports happening all day every dy there that you can watch and even some strongman demonstrations that are really cool.  Also, at the center of everything is the expo which is just a bunch of rows of booths setup by different companies. Some will give out samples to try there, some will give you packets of their stuff to take home and try, some will have famous people you can get a picture with, etc. All in all it's a great time if you don't mind a crowd, which there certainly will be."

Because I don't use that but my boyfriend might be interested... what about like t-shirts or something? and what kinds of famous people might be there?! Thanks!
ArnoldSchwarzenegger,1yj0w6,gcburn2,1 point,Fri Feb 21 22:22:54 2014 UTC,"most of it is supplement stuff, but they also give out granola bars and stuff. sometimes i they do shirts, but not too often.  the famous people are almost always old bodybuilders. in the past when I've seen/shook hands with Jay Cutler, Ronnie Coleman, Frank Zane(who is one of my favorite bodybuilders of all time so I was supremely stoked), and more. there will be plenty others, but most are going to be famous specifically to the body building community so unless you're in the know you might not recognize them.  if you get bored of the expo, which can take several hours to get through, I really do recommend checking out the martial arts competitions. they have kids from the age of ~5 up to full grown men. the kids are just plain cute while the older guys are just plain impressive.  if you enjoy sport and fitness you will not run out of things to see."
ArnoldSchwarzenegger,1yj0w6,thegillinator,1 point,Sat Feb 22 16:44:16 2014 UTC,"This year Jason Statham will be there, as well as Joe Magianello, so there's some celebs from outside bodybuilding. Oh, and Lou Ferrigno is usually there, though you have to pay up at least $20 for a photo to even shake his hand or talk to him.  The expo is super-crowded all day Saturday, so try to hit it on the other days and do other events on Saturday.  I'm driving out tonight, I cover it for TheArnoldFans.com. You CAN see Arnold as he walks the expo hall usually mid-morning or mid-afternoon. Watch for his security detail and others clearing a path and get ahead and near the edge of the crowd- when he goes by you may get a quick handshake or autograph if you make eye contact and stick your hand out.   He also starts off the Pump & Run Sunday morning, but the best place to get your Arnold fill is Sunday at 11am the ""Champions & Legends Sunday Showcase."" Tickets are $50, but you can get a seat within 10-20 feet of Arnold if you're early, hear him talk for a while, then possibly ask him a question. It's fantastic, I totally recommend it!"

ArnoldSchwarzenegger,1vxfss,ClownsAteMyBaby,4,Thu Jan 23 12:40:20 2014 UTC,Should be an easy answer for everyone; T800 from T2 is easily the best protector of any of the choices. It would actually have been a more interesting discussion if we have removed his non human roles from the equation. Dutch is my choice if we are going human characters.  EDIT: Terminator model
ArnoldSchwarzenegger,1vxfss,Tall_Rassman,0,Thu Jan 23 16:17:01 2014 UTC,Mr.Freeze is much stronger than T-800. Unless he doesn't get his suit and weapons.
ArnoldSchwarzenegger,1vxfss,JoshuaKevinPerry,3,Fri Jan 24 01:18:37 2014 UTC,Batman took out Freeze. T-800 can take out Batman easily. Sound logic.

ArnoldSchwarzenegger,1vxfss,BigSnackintosh,3,Thu Jan 23 18:55:13 2014 UTC,"Mr. Freeze is my bodyguard, with the T800 coming in a close second.  I'm thinking Mr. Freeze is going to have an ice cannon of sorts that might be able to render all other Arnolds immobile, giving me time to escape.    In a 1 vs 1, with T800 as bodyguard, Freeze might be able to get the jump and freeze my T800 bodyguard long enough to take me out. I can't take that chance, I am not skilled vs. futuristic weaponry and wouldn't last long against a freeze cannon.  However, with Mr. Freeze by my side, he could chill-out opposing Arnolds long enough for me to take most of them down utilizing a firearm of sorts."

ArnoldSchwarzenegger,1vtfuq,dre10g,3,Wed Jan 22 10:32:08 2014 UTC,"Here's a bit from linked Wikipedia article about Saurer 4K 4FA :      The Saurer 4K 4FA is an Austrian armoured personnel carrier with caterpillar tracks. It was later replaced by the Steyr 4K 7FA G 127. It went into production in 1961. In 1956, Osterreichische Saurer-Werke of Vienna (which was taken over by Steyr-Daimler-Puch AG in 1970) started development of an armoured personnel carrier. The first prototype, the 3K 3H, was completed in 1958 and the second, the 4K 3H, the following year. They are both powered by a Saurer 3H 200 hp diesel engine.  The next model, the 4K 2P, had a different hull layout, a new torsion bar suspension and was powered by a 250 hp Saurer 2P diesel engine. In appearance it was similar to the first production vehicles which were completed in 1961 and designated 4K 4F. Later production vehicles were the 4K 3FA (230 hp) and the 4K 4FA (250 hp), which differed only in minor details such as their Sauer engines.  A total of 445 production vehicles was delivered to the Austrian Army in the following versions: 30 4K 4F, 211  ...

It's basically as if you befriended 100000 random people on facebook and then watched your feed. Rules are necessary to keep a decent level of civility and whatever you consider quality. And if you don't enforce them you might as well not have them.  Sure the rules aren't perfect. And this post wouldn't have ruined the sub. It probably would have been an entertaining thread. But I can definitely see why it was removed as it was clearly against their 2. rule.

I can't wait to see Arnie in a proper movie where the writers aren't bottom-bin and there's more to the premise than merely getting him back on screen. I haven't seen Escape Plan yet though.

I think the bad guy in the sports car plot was boring, and the Forest Whittaker scenes were entirely unnecessary. If you were to edit the movie down to the Arnold-only scenes I think it would stand out as being much more watchable. What was I hoping for? A bit of the old ultraviolence, some one liners, and at least once scene where someone thought bringing it to fisticuffs with Arnie would be a good idea. I got that. Will I watch this movie again? Highly unlikely. Did it quench my thirst while I wait for a more substantial Arnold offering? Absolutely."

ArnoldSchwarzenegger,1tsdwk,DFerrie,1 point,Fri Dec 27 05:13:04 2013 UTC,I really wish he would sign on for another Predator movie. One that's a continuation of the original. I like the idea that Dutch climbed the ranks of the military brass and he is called on to lead a team to take on Predator threats. I thought the AvP movies had too little story and character development and Adrian Brody was a real funny joke as the leading alpha male in Predators. Pathetic.   Arnold if you are reading this please either reboot Predator or even better tell another story of Dutch commanding a team of badasses that go after multiple predators at some flashpoint on earth. I don't know.... maybe killing some Predators who are trying to stage a Xenomorph outbreak to cull the human population? Only one man fought a Predator and lived. Only one actor can play him.

ArnoldSchwarzenegger,1tle11,scdayo,2,Tue Dec 24 14:21:07 2013 UTC,I get the feeling that Arnold wouldn't be too comfortable sitting in a voice acting studio for hours on end unless he got to do something physical as well like mo-cap action sequences.

ArnoldSchwarzenegger,1tle11,preventDefault,2,Tue Dec 24 18:30:46 2013 UTC,I'd think the game would have to be something where Arnold feels passionate about. Take Riddick: Escape from Butcher's Bay; Vin Diesel devastated the voice acting because he was very passionate to the voice-over role.

You are out relaxing along a lake and Dutch pops onto your shoulders and says you need to cover yourself with mud to hide. While horseriding, Harry Tasker shows up and tells you how much fun it would be to jump from skyscraper to skyscraper. You visit a travel agent about a vacation and Douglas Quaid shows up with pamphlets for Recall. You take a Harley in for service and you wander the show room.

ArnoldSchwarzenegger,1t7hmh,NotMyRealNameAgain,10,Wed Jan 22 06:55:37 2014 UTC,"Arnold Schwarzenegger as “Tank Goodman”  Tank is gathering his fishing gear and is talking on his cell phone about how it is great to finally have a peaceful day of rest and relaxation out in nature.  His cartoon pet dog and cat are looking like they want his attention, but aren’t getting any.  Tank continues saying into his cell phone, “ Oh yeah, I would have to be crazy to not go out and enjoy a peaceful day fishing and relaxing, everything is great, thank you, I hate to be repeating myself, ok, you too, goodbye”.   His cat goes to rub on his leg, “no no no, watch out for the kitty”. The dog is standing there with a ball in his mouth,  but Tank doesn’t even notice as he hurries to get his things together.  The cartoon pet dog and cat then wink at each other and sneak away with mischievous smiles on their faces.   All at once, Tank picks up all of the gear he has gathered, including a decent sized fishing boat, to carry it out to his SUV.   A RED ALERT IS SOUNDED  Tanks eyes become wide with surprise, as he quickly glances with surprise at the red flashing lights in his shed, and then drops everything at once to cover his ears from the very loud alarm sound that immediately follows the flashing lights in his shed.    Arnold flips a secret panel on the shed wall that exposes a numbered keypad.  He quickly types in his code, and it is denied. He types it in again, and it is denied again. “OH CMON, What Is IT”? He says out loud and trying to remember.  The blare of the alarm and the flash of the red light becomes merely background noise as Tank stares with rock solid concentration at the numbered keypad. In an intense instant he says under his breath, “Oh yeah….”.  He pushes the buttons in a fashion so that the individual sounds of the individual buttons he pushes, play the notes of the vocals in the chorus of , ”Merry Christmas (War is over)”  by the Plastic Ono Band. Tank is smiling a little and is dreamingly moving his head side to side to the tune of the ‘makeshift song’ he is playing , amidst the alarm and emergency lights in the seemingly distant background. The code is quickly accepted as he finishes the final note, and the whole wall opens up to reveal his tank stashed away behind the wall.  He quickly climbs onto the tank and mans the cockpit while still in his fishing gear, waders, fishing vest, and all. Tank removes his fishing hat, that is covered with I love fishing pins, and lures hanging from it, and he hangs it up on a hook in the cockpit labeled ‘fishing hat’, and then plucks his army helmet from the hook right next to , simply labeled ‘helmet’.   Tanks tank barrels through the secret two- track that is gnarled deep within the unknown wooded terrain.  The roar of the gunned engine wails loudly. Tank glances to the dashboard in the cockpit and flips a switch, the sound of the engine turns to the sound of a dirt bike engine being revved up. He shakes his head and says, ”nah”, and hits another button and the sound of the motorcycle engine being revved up turns to the sound of helicopter blades whipping through the air. Then a smile slowly creeps across tanks face, as he pulls a lever between his legs. This time, instead of the tank mimicking the sound of an engine from an entirely different vehicle, the thunderous gallop and wail of a charging elephant echoes through the wilderness.   Tank veers the hunk of metal off into a small clearing and tightly parks the tank between two trees.  He quickly climbs out of the cockpit, and camouflages himself in the just overhead leafy branches of the trees. While positioning himself on top of the tank, he begins to carefully scan the area with an oversized pair of binoculars. Tank is searching through his binoculars, but seems to not find what he is looking for. Simultaneously, he is rifling through the breast pocket of his fishing vest for something. The pocket is empty, so he climbs back into the tanks cockpit to search for what he thought was in his pocket.  Then from above, and without Tanks notice as he is going through the glove box,  his cartoon pet dog and cats paws are seen reaching down to Tank through the open cockpit hatch. They tickle Tank until he laughs really hard and he is begging them to stop. Then they jump into his lap and they hug him as he pets them.   Tank – I thought I had better things to do, but if it is something we cannot do together, than it is something not worth doing!  The End"
ArnoldSchwarzenegger,1t7hmh,ItzJ,33,Thu Dec 19 15:18:31 2013 UTC,I have an idea!  hold a filmakers contest on reddit for people to recreate famous scenes from your movies.  you are the judge of the clips and the best one wins a trip on the tank! !   you will get hundreds if not thousands of submissions from enthusiastic redditors and the whole thing will be spread across the net and raise awareness --   I know there are a lot of amateur and even pro film makers out there that would love to do this.  good luck!

How about you shoot a video where all of your 'famous' characters are in a battle againsts each other to see who is the 'ultimate' character. To prove this, they need to raise as much money as the can for their fundraiser. So for example... The Terminator goes door to door selling chocolate bars, Dutch from Predator sells lemonade on the side of the road! It could be an interesting idea!

Then you say ""not every child gets to control their future"", followed by info about the fundraiser. Simple and pretty funny in my mind.

ArnoldSchwarzenegger,1t7hmh,ELFAHBEHT_SOOP,2,Thu Dec 19 00:09:35 2013 UTC,"I have an idea but it is quite out-there but seeing as you mentioned it could be that i'll go ahead.  My idea could be called a short film or a maybe a 2 minute long skit where you are all geared up ready for battle, including the tank, and you a giving an epic pep talk to your troops before battle. I think it would be awesome if the troops were some of the kids from After-School All-Stars but if you can't do that I still think young adults (15+) would be great as it really makes us feel as though ""that could be us!"" I know it'd work for me.  Not only could the pep talk be SIMPLY a pep talk but you should use it to talk about the campaign and 'what you're fighting for'. Give information on what you're doing.  I'm also picturing that during the bad-ass speech, the battle that you are preparing for could be shown in small snippets. Eg. You're giving the speech, getting everyone riled up and it could cut to a split-second shot of the tank firing or an epic scene of you, your tank and your troops in battle with dirt flying and bullets hailing (Dunno if bullets present a good image for this but hey-ho). And the snippets could get longer and more intense and extreme as your speech does the same.   The battle coincides with the fury of your speech.  I think it should end with you breaking the fourth-wall, slowly move from talking to your troops and face the camera and direct us, something like ""what are you gonna do about it"" but obviously more impressive.   Oh and you have to do your True-Lies DVD front cover face with more of a squinty eye when you do the last part, it'll work, trust me."

Arnold doesn't want to do it, but Joe inches closer to him, and bullies him into compliance. Arnold hands over his shirt and boots and says ""take it, it's outside"". Arnold sits down dejected in a chair, clearly upset.  Joe walks outside to see the tank sitting there. Just as he's about to get in the tank an older man busts out the door of the bar. He fires a warning shot into the air. ""I can't let you take the mans wheels son. He needs those wheels for After-School All-Stars.

If you've ever seen the movie Tropic Thunder, the actors make all these ridiculous movie previews towards the beginning (Robert Downey Jr. plays a gay priest, Ben Stiller plays an 80s action star, etc etc). You could do some obviously fake movie trailers, similar to when you were dressed up as Hamlet in Last Action Hero.  Or you could do what Bill Murray has been doing lately and just walk around town, randomly surprising people. You could film yourself doing anything, from showing up at Frat party to doing karaoke at a dive bar. The idea would be that you could be anywhere and everywhere at once. Film people's reactions to your impromptu visits.  Lastly, maybe you could do some flash mob stuff.

Schwarzenegger has always been one of my favorite movie stars ever and I told myself that someday I'd go visit his hometown. Last July, I went on a backpacking trip across Western Europe and once I entered Austria, I was a man on a mission. I traveled down to Graz by train and took a bus trip west.  After the ride up into the serene hills of Austria, I arrived at the small town of Thal. Here, I entered the building that gave birth to an international icon, /u/govschwarzenegger. The childhood home of the best bodybuilder that ever lived, among the greatest movie stars in cinema history, and former governor of America's most desirable state. Here was where an ambitious young boy from an insignificant town in the middle of nowhere decided to become immortal."

I stayed at the little inn next to Thalersee and had a beer as you did and some great Austrian food! The guy who runs the place is one of Arnold's old friends, he let me have some pins and showed me a case of the Arnold mementos they had at the time.

I didn't see Ray and Emil, I saw Stallone and Schwarzengger just having a good time. Two old bad-ass dudes, still kicking ass. That's pretty cool in my opinion.

For example, when Arnold waved at the end of the movie, I knew he was waving at me. I also felt partly responsible that the movie wasn't a big success, like if we let him down.  And judging by his recent interaction with everyone here on reddit, I'm convinced that Arnold is one of the few celebrities who truly understands and appreciates us."
ArnoldSchwarzenegger,1q4x61,barrybulsara,3,Fri Nov 8 17:01:08 2013 UTC,I actually avoided this movie for years because of the bad reviews.

I work harder in school, work and definitely the gym because of what I have learned from his books, speeches, etc. I went to the gym at 7am today cause I had no other time and as I was going I seconded guessed myself then I thought about Arnolds 7 rules about life and didn't think about it twice. He has helped me so many times in life. definitely the most inspirational person I know"
ArnoldSchwarzenegger,1o33g0,Rugger11,2,Wed Oct 9 21:41:01 2013 UTC,"Awesome response. I feel the same way about his 7 rules about life. My girlfriend is despairing right now because of the job market and the fact that she thinks she wants to go back to school, but that its going to take more time to get to where she wants.

ArnoldSchwarzenegger,1o33g0,General96,2,Wed Oct 9 23:59:14 2013 UTC,One of my favorite lines by him by far! She would definitely make it a lot farther if she did what she loved to do. I love how he taught me to not just do something but to become the greatest at what I do
ArnoldSchwarzenegger,1o33g0,LordThor21,2,Thu Oct 10 12:33:43 2013 UTC,"Love the reference to Salute Your Shorts!   Arnold really does inspire me to better my life. He's been my fav actor since I was a kid, but lately I've been reading more about him and checking out his work out routines. I have starting lifting more and working out more in general. I've also taken up smoking cigars. Not because of Arny, but he does make it look cool as fuck."
