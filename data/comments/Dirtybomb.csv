Dirtybomb,3e3tvh,GrassWaterDirtHorse,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:32:24 2015 UTC,"Is the effect from ""Focus"" that noticeable? I personally find ""Get Up"" to be invaluable as a medic. One short charge and you revive weak classes at 100% health, it's great."
Dirtybomb,3e3tvh,SgtTittyfist,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:29:17 2015 UTC,"The thing about focus is that the description is wrong, it also works when firing from the hip.  I notice when running focus augment I win a lot more duels, especially with how strong aimpunch is right now (although this patch will hopefully change that).  Since they changed it to where you can still gib for the first second after a revive, killing the enemy before reviving someone is pretty important and focus+drilled helps out a lot with that."
Dirtybomb,3e3tvh,Logios,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:35:16 2015 UTC,"I am aware that Focus reduces all aimpunch, but I still doubt if it's worth giving up the strongest medic perk for? I feel as though the K-121 and M4A1 suffer greatly from aimpunch, while weapons like the Kek-10 and Crotzni have a high enough ROF to allow for you to regain track of the enemy."
Dirtybomb,3e3tvh,SgtTittyfist,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:50:57 2015 UTC,"It's the best perk in the game, as of right now.   However, the above mentioned patch ""should"" fix focus in the sense that it will only apply for iron-sights. Or at least that's what a lot of people are hoping for.   Either way, depending on how much aimpunch will be reduced, it will probably not make much of a difference."
Dirtybomb,3e3tvh,Oksiiii,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:27:56 2015 UTC,It's the best perk in the game   I really kinda doubt that. Unshakable is also absolutely godlike. A Fragger gets over 200 effective health against explosives with it. A Rhino gets almost 300.
Dirtybomb,3e3tvh,SgtTittyfist,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:36:25 2015 UTC,"Only applies to Rhino and Fragger. Any other merc it's a ""wasted"" perk on. Even so, some of the top Fraggers still opted out to run focus instead.   Focus is the best perk in higher level play. Having a 50% reduction to aimpunch is a ridiculous amount when playing against people that actually shoot back."
Dirtybomb,3e3tvh,Oksiiii,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:44:24 2015 UTC,"To be fair, like 99% of players are just pub-scrubs. Focus is simply a waste when your enemies can't retaliate properly. Of course a perk that makes gunfights easier to win is going to be almost mandatory in high-tier play.  Anyways, I hope that aimpunch will be gone, poof'd and out the window in a few weeks for everybody but Vasili."
Dirtybomb,3e3tvh,SgtTittyfist,2,Tue Jul 21 21:47:58 2015 UTC,MissMurder just said on a community stream today that they ill be giving the katana to more mercs in the loadouts. yesterday on the dev stream they said they will change how loadouts work soon.
Dirtybomb,3e3tvh,canzpl,5,Tue Jul 21 19:55:58 2015 UTC,"Oh god, no."
Dirtybomb,3e3tvh,crispytoast9,7,Tue Jul 21 20:50:02 2015 UTC,"That sounds like a terrible solution. That won't fix Phantom.  I really hope this isn't the case. They don't need to give other mercs an OP melee weapon, and it removes one of Phantom's unique traits. This is a bad sign. If they need to ruin the Katana, ruin the Katana.. but don't just give it to other mercs as-is.  And they shouldn't change the loadout system too much. People have paid for loadouts. Maybe the game wasn't as ready for a commercial launch as they thought?"
Dirtybomb,3e3tvh,MrBogard,6,Tue Jul 21 20:14:11 2015 UTC,"And they shouldn't change the loadout system too much. People have paid for loadouts.   So by that logic they should leave Phantom alone as well, since people paid for him. That logic doesn't work in multiplayer games where balance is king."
Dirtybomb,3e3tvh,ControlPhreakk,2,Tue Jul 21 20:24:49 2015 UTC,"Key words: ""too much""  Turning the loadout system completely on its head will not be a simple balance change. Neither is giving other mercs the friggin Katana. Those both sound like terrible decisions. This is why the game has a 60-something score on metacritic. It was not ready for prime time.  I love DirtyBomb but I'm disappointed in its development."
Dirtybomb,3e3tvh,MrBogard,2,Tue Jul 21 20:25:57 2015 UTC,Again you just speculate. The katana is not OP on other characters than Phantom. Good luck running up to someone as Sparks or Aura with the katana without getting destroyed. You need the cloak on Phantom to get close enough to use the katana as a main weapon.    Turning the loadout system completely on its head   That was never stated. They said that they will make changes to the loadout system. That could mean a ton of different things:   Trading of loadout cards Selling of loadout cards on the Steam marketplace Changing some of the pointless perks Making more of them viable by changing weapon stats    This is why this game has a 60-something score on metacritic. This game was not ready for prime time.   Have you seen the reviews for the game? A ton of unknown reviewing sites have reviewed the game. Who cares about PC Invasion? Gamespot is the only major outlet that made a review and gave the game a mediocre score with no points at all about development time or patches.
Dirtybomb,3e3tvh,ControlPhreakk,2,Tue Jul 21 20:38:58 2015 UTC,Good luck running up to someone as Sparks or Aura with the katana without getting destroyed   I do this all the time. It's really hard to hit a springy light merc. And running straight up to someone in a Phantom is an easy way to get detected early.
Dirtybomb,3e3tvh,GrassWaterDirtHorse,-1,Tue Jul 21 20:45:59 2015 UTC,"The difference there is that you are still visible while running. I've played with teams where a Proxy runs past everyone in Underground and plants a bomb at the last objective, but if just one person is awake, you will get shot and lose your 80 hp really fast. Especially when trying to kill people with more than 100 hp."
Dirtybomb,3e3tvh,ControlPhreakk,2,Tue Jul 21 20:49:53 2015 UTC,"I would like to disagree with you on this point.   The katana is not OP on other characters than Phantom.   The utter leniency of the katana, its range, and power makes it an overpowered weapon. A melee weapon that does a significant amount of damage, such as the katana, needs some of kind of trade-off. It has recovery frames, but the fact is you get multiple hits on the same stab (not even a swing) like some kind of chainsaw makes it broken. Once they make the katana match it's length and the swing speed, recovery frame length, it'll be fine to give to other mercs, but until then, I'd rather just Phantom be broken.  Another thing is, realistically and logically, the katana should do more damage and swing faster/recover faster than the cricket bat. What does that do to balance? Does the katana get more damage, swing faster, have a faster recovery, and a have a better reach? What's the point of the bat then?"
Dirtybomb,3e3tvh,littlestminish,3,Tue Jul 21 21:27:21 2015 UTC,It's been pretty much confirmed since the first few days Phantom was out that they planned on giving the katana to other characters at well.
Dirtybomb,3e3tvh,Oblivion_Lost667,5,Tue Jul 21 20:20:14 2015 UTC,Meh. Terrible. They should change the monetization model too then. And also make the katana a re-skin of the cricket bat. That is very disappointing to hear.
Dirtybomb,3e3tvh,MrBogard,2,Tue Jul 21 20:22:01 2015 UTC,what is this commercial launch you are talking about? the game is in open beta. it didnt launch yet ;q
Dirtybomb,3e3tvh,canzpl,2,Tue Jul 21 20:39:27 2015 UTC,"The game launched commercially. They even told Gamespot that the open beta launch was “effectively the full launch of the game.” That is a direct quote. It's not a real beta. It's just an unfinished, but released game."
Dirtybomb,3e3tvh,MrBogard,0,Tue Jul 21 20:42:10 2015 UTC,"His refractive armor will be unique, he doesn't need the katana to be his only. If they fix the katana itself (make it not possible to beyblade and get 5 kills with 1 blow), it should be fine, specially since only a few merchs will have access to it."
Dirtybomb,3e3tvh,Whitepubes,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:20:51 2015 UTC,"They already nerfed the max turn speed w/ melee weapons. They need to nerf the dmg all the way down to the other melee weapons if they're going to give it to other mercs. Oh well! I can't wait to grind out new loadouts for another 100 hours, or pay real money for the new load outs."
Dirtybomb,3e3tvh,MrBogard,3,Tue Jul 21 20:23:42 2015 UTC,"The katana does only 5 damage more than the Stiletto, which does 85. The problem is that Phantom can easily aquire Chopper in his best loadout, which will make him do 108 damage on a heavy attack, while the range of the katana is quite a bit longer."
Dirtybomb,3e3tvh,SgtTittyfist,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:46:43 2015 UTC,"I don't like playing slots to getting a level playing field, but giving the katana to multiple people?

Dirtybomb,3e3tvh,xxnekuxx,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:39:46 2015 UTC,"Why they released phantom before red-eye I have no fucking clue. Red-eye wouldn't pub stomp as hard, and would already be in place to counter phantom. I doubt there would have been such a huge outcry if he (red-eye) was released before phantom.  I wouldn't mind removing phantom until there are more mercs available to counter him, (red-eye and scorcher for example). As of right now, the only real counter is vas and he has cool downs on his spotting grenade while phantom can activate his stealth/invuln shield so long as he has the energy for it."
Dirtybomb,3e3tvh,Whitepubes,-3,Tue Jul 21 21:23:32 2015 UTC,"Aimpunch should be removed though. If that's what overreacting will do to it then I'm completely fine with it. Same thing goes for Phantom, I hope they make him as useless as possible, even though I have him."

Dirtybomb,3e3tvh,JGStonedRaider,2,Tue Jul 21 19:42:19 2015 UTC,"^ this. First started playing this game a few weeks back and loved it, then aimpunch was increased and I was seriously considering quitting as aimpunch is just a noob crutch and frustrating as hell.  Hell even worse is two skilled players shooting at each other and both failing hard due to their aim flailing around."
Dirtybomb,3e3tvh,adetonian,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:11:20 2015 UTC,"Meh I think aimpunch can have a place as long as it doesn't impact the game as much as it currently does in DB. Example in ET there was waaaaaaaay more knockback/aimpunch while getting hit but it was only the camera, your bullets would still go where you were originally aiming so it became an 'extra little skill' to be able to ignore the camera flailing but still landing the shots and tracking well. Or atleast DB needs to have a slightly less drastic aimpunch but I disagree with people saying that aimpunch has to completely be removed."
Dirtybomb,3e3tvh,JGStonedRaider,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:20:24 2015 UTC,"Well having come from competitive BF4 (even if it was a joke) we had to deal with visual recoil and suppression which have both been removed or nerfed since. But they both left a very sour taste in the mouth.   Pre patch aimpunch was fine and even viewkick I wouldn't have an issue with as long as you still shoot straight, you just have to know where the centre of your screen is. But in it's current state is make me actually feel nauseous when being shot due to aimpunch being even more pronounced at lower FOV's (74 V / 90 H FOV)"

Make it more class specific so your lighter classes like Proxy, Vassili, etc. have the higher punch which would be normal.  Then they'd also have to calculate in the perk that helps defer the aimpunch.  It'd be more work but I think it'd make more sense and help even out the jumping Proxies."

Then he switched to the default card, without mechanic, and the EV was repaired just as fast. Here's where the bug kicks in.

The EV will not take damage if it isn't completely repaired. So repair it most of the way, so that anyone can really just touch it and finish the repair.

Either way, unless the entire team is dead and respawning soon, you shouldn't be actively seeking more kills. Make sure objective is handled before you go on your rampage.

If there is something in any game that requires someone to hold a button, i wont do it. because someone can hold that button just as good as i can, but they cannot replace me nearly as well as the defender. ofcourse in competitive this would be different because i will be matched with equally skilled players probably.

Another change that would hold a bigger player base, but they probably won't do, is to decrease the grind.  As TB pointed out in his video, 50k for mercs is a little steep.  Its not the worst I've seen from a F2P shop, but its far from the best.  Other than bug fixing and anti-cheat the game just needs a steady stream of new content.  Unless Stoker, Red Eye, Thunder, and Phoenix come out vastly changed that's content that has been in the pipeline for a while.

Companies create shitty shop models because they're banking on the games whales to fund most of the game for them. When you create a system with a terribly slow grind for free players combined with a shop with absolutely atrocious prices, bundles, and randomization then eventually you will drive those f2p players away and your game will die. If you want to keep the whales spending money on your shitty cash shop then you can't fuck over your f2p players with an abysmal grind. The grind right now isn't slowly stringing along f2p players, it's dragging them along an arid desert in search of a sip of muddy water from the next oasis.  I'd love to spend money on the cash shop to support this game. It's fun, barring some of their shitty character design and balance decisions. I have the money to spend but it will be a cold day in hell when I support a game with a company that makes a cash shop as shitty as this one.

Tribes had you spending 10-50 bucks or more just to unlock everything for a single class.  The prices aren't even that outrageous, 10 bucks? That's basically one hour of pay at any decent job, surely you can afford that. Maybe not all at once, but you also can't expect the grind to be too easy otherwise they won't make enough to fund the game development.  Instead of bitching about it understand that a game isn't developed for free, the money to get it rolling has to come from somewhere.

So I paid 22 bucks for the game. Every time a new merc gets released, I'd have enough credits to buy them.   I just made sure I got my daily play/win bonus, and did a few missions every day. Sometimes, I'll just join a quick game to get the play bonus if I'm super busy that day.  I have about 220 hours in the game. I own every single merc along with over 100,000 credits for the next two mercs.   Now, here's the important part of the story: I don't use every merc. In fact, I only use about 4-5 mercs.  Many of the mercs I will never touch again.  So why does everyone need to have access to EVERYTHING? If people want access to everything, then expect to pay some money for it.

Dirtybomb,3e26g1,TeaL3af,3,Tue Jul 21 14:22:55 2015 UTC,yeah. i dont play 12 hours a day. i play around 4. you do 3-4 quest rotations per day. one rotation takes from 20 to 40 mins. you basicly log in when the rotations reset (every 3 hrs) and do the missions. its really easy to earn credits in this game. and they want to tweak the missions in tomorrows patch too.

Dirtybomb,3e26g1,d0caL,6,Tue Jul 21 16:18:25 2015 UTC,"A test server. To insure that no merc is (re)released in the state Phantom is in, allowing players to play the prototype maps all the time not on specific weekends.  Anticheat is always appreciated, expecially for competative - I don't play it because I hate Stopwatch but I have played with a hacker or two in Objective which wasn't very fun.  I think the ability to open cases for specific mercs, similar to the trade-up system will really help newer players not feel inclined to dump abunch of credits into loadout cases and get loadouts for mercs they don't own. Say you only wanted a lead Aura loadout.   Something else to do with loadouts. Right now all you can do is trade-up all those lead and iron loadouts. Selling them for credits or the marketplace is a pretty good option.  The ability to reroll the missions given every 2 hours. Right now, I dismiss any missions related to Stopwatch or wins in a gamemode. Since I can't garentee I can complete them. I think the ability to reroll each mission only once would drastically help players feel less inclined to be forced to play Aura for 6-7 games to get the support Xp. Or vice versa with a medic player having to try to get top frag (Which is possible, don't think I'm saying medics can't)  This and a better tutorial, party lobbies, more side objectives, older mercs to be (re)released - Where's my pheonix."

It's already very fun to play, I've been playing it for a month or so and already put in 250 hours. I'd love so see some more maps, but the existing maps are excellent. ET:QW had 12 maps (I think) plus all the community made ones. I hope to see at least 10 or so maps in DB too. Class system in DB is even more fun, at least for me.      The only thing that can put me off of DB is if they make it more casual than it already is. That may even kill the game, SD will have no chance of competing against Blizzard (and Valve). They should make it even more competitive IMHO."
Dirtybomb,3e26g1,Terr_,4,Tue Jul 21 18:44:50 2015 UTC,"Maybe fix the load screen issue. I've tried the tricks I've ran across. But it still sticks on the load screen.

Dirtybomb,3e26g1,DOGpls,4,Tue Jul 21 19:13:07 2015 UTC,"First, removing causes of rage-quitting. In order of importance:   Anti-cheat software, or at least a sane reporting system. Team-balancing in public servers (related suggestions) Any matchmaking fixes needed after the first two.   I'm placing matchmaking last because I believe DB loses far more potential players (and payers) early in the process."
Dirtybomb,3e26g1,Clearskky,4,Tue Jul 21 16:30:12 2015 UTC,"As others have said, anti cheat is a must. Community maps would be the next step assuming dedicated severs are coming. Finally to keep people, community skins switching to a dota2 style f2p. Perhaps put a spending cap where all mercs are unlocked and then another cap, say 100 bucks to unlock all cosmetics. Yes, that would abandon the retarded card system but this isn't a kids trading card game and we can't trade cards anyway."
Dirtybomb,3e26g1,Tyrosoldier,3,Tue Jul 21 16:52:58 2015 UTC,"A new map every two months, with an alternate mode for it the month after.  A new merc every 3 months (going to get hard keeping it fresh after a while though).  I'd like a redraw every month.  Say 3 attempts and you can have a chosen loadout card randomly swapped to another of the same tier and merc.  It will stop people ending up with a gold card of the load out they don't want and getting frustrated to the end of time with it.  Another idea is weekend bonuses.  Get an additional case on a Saturday and Sunday on your third win."
Dirtybomb,3e26g1,Clearskky,3,Tue Jul 21 17:20:01 2015 UTC,"Honestly, aside from Matchmaking improvements and maybe some more game modes and maps, there's not much that they can do.  Often I see people bitch and moan about the game, but they don't wanna sit down and learn how to freaking play it right. So if anything, I'd say the game is just under the same curse as other competitive games, it's not as easy to pick up as something more casual like TF2.   So, unless they wanna poison the game by lowering the expectations of their players, I'd say they are going to have to deal with it as is."
Dirtybomb,3e26g1,Terr_,3,Tue Jul 21 15:11:54 2015 UTC,"Better anti-cheat.  An in-game report system to get rid of cheaters the system can't detect (as we've learned from CSGO, anti-cheat systems aren't 100% fullproof).  Get rid of ""Win X stopwatch mode matches"" as it encourages stacking and leaving during mid-game if you're on the losing team.  Lower the amount of EXP required for Waterboy (support) missions.  Faster merc rotations to keep things fresh (maybe every week instead of 2 weeks).  A way to trade-down or transform loadout cards."
Dirtybomb,3e26g1,Shylocv,7,Tue Jul 21 15:26:06 2015 UTC,"I feel like part of the problem is the community.  For some reason, this community is very negative and is quick to jump on the ""omg, this is the worst thing in the world"" train for whatever they're bitching about that week.  Do you think people coming here and trying to get into the game wants to hear that?  No, they don't.  They don't really give a shit about the game and they damn sure won't when they see everyone bitching.  Faster progression would help.  I feel like it takes too damn long to earn mercs.  That being said, I understand that the devs don't want you to get all the mercs too fast and then be out of progression to achieve.  Perhaps once more mercs are in the game, we can either get more ways to earn credits or just earn more credits per mission we complete.  I really don't have any other major complaints.  Dirty Bomb is a solid game with solid gameplay.  I would love to see more maps, of course, but those will come with time.  But I do have a request for the devs... can I PLEASE get less Waterboy missions in my queue?  I really don't enjoy playing medic that much but I feel like I'm being forced to and that's really not very fun.  Can we get some missions for the other classes?  Maybe get X melee kills or do X amount of explosive damage or something?"

However, threads like this that basically say the game will die if it doesn't change weren't upvoted and the comments became very rare after people made posts saying shut up ur not helping. These threads quickly lead to dead game comments and posts all the time and carry a negative views of the game, community and the future of the game with them. I have never seen anything positive come out of threads like this they just turn into a place for the whole community to share the parts of the game they don't like and without much or any open discussion."
Dirtybomb,3e26g1,BearPawsOG,6,Tue Jul 21 16:29:03 2015 UTC,I think the biggest problem at the moment is the heavy grind factor. 50k for a merc is quite ridiculous.
Dirtybomb,3e26g1,BearPawsOG,2,Tue Jul 21 18:32:17 2015 UTC,Exactly how many hours of F2P activity per 50k merc would you consider not-ridiculous?  Is 30 hours for a 50k merc ridiculous?
Dirtybomb,3e26g1,ziLaK,3,Tue Jul 21 13:25:44 2015 UTC,"Eh I think it's fine. Only 14 mercs at the moment. 3 are free if you count Fragger, and 3 get put on free rotation every two weeks. With the exception of this rotation that has Fragger in it, there's only 8 Mercs you need to buy at any given time and not all of them cost 50k. There's enough variety there to keep me entertained while I save for new mercs.   50k is nowhere near the word rediculous. If you do missions daily, you'll get a new merc every two weeks with little in-game time actually spent.   SplashDamage rewards us for playing casual bits daily. It's the people that fight the system and play 10 hours a day that call it a grind.  Of course, this is all my opinion."

Why? Because Blizzard. There isn't anything SD can do to keep ALL players here.     What can be done, though, is keep some of the players. How? By making Dirty Bomb distinctively recognizable against two major competitors: TF2 and Overwatch. And what is THE one thing that's different? Both TF2 and Overwatch are and will be VERY casual oriented. We need to help keep DB maintain the status of the only serious and competitive game. So, MM has to be perfect, competitive community has to be the best of all three games, cups, tournaments, all that jazz.      I sort of feel that SD has been steering the game with that in mind for some time already, maybe since open beta. The game is anything but casual, you have to be ready to put in at least 100 hours just to get started and probably 400-1000 hours to be really good. It's SD way of making games anyway, and smart concept and positioning will help the game survive the Overwatch apocalypse event."

If they are going the MOBA business model, the balance issue seems to be constant, in the MOBA games some heroes are constantly banned (sometimes by players, sometimes by tournament admins).

Dirtybomb,3e26g1,granpappynurgle,2,Tue Jul 21 17:57:15 2015 UTC,What's gamebreaking that they've waited two weeks on?
Dirtybomb,3e26g1,Smiffsten,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:40:33 2015 UTC,"I think he is talking about Phantom. IMO he isn't game breaking but I feel like he does need to be balanced. I don't know what other people said but I feel like he should have never been given a primary weapon. Maybe only a sidearm. Thinking over to TF2 with the spy he has a knife and pistol, giving someone like phantom an SMG is just stupid. He basically turns to a regular solider that can go invisible, blast past people, and then decloak behind them and kill them with his SMG."

Dirtybomb,3e26g1,klutch2013,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:51:51 2015 UTC,"Player base is dropping on a daily basis. The phantom update is partially to blame. I wasted 50k on fragger because I didn't know there were codes and know I am finding myself struggling to gather other 50k. Now I don't want to spend them before they release other mercs or before I've checked every giveaway there is. The reason is the grind required is too much for a semi casual player and the cost for mercs is too high. Even heroes on hots drop price after a while. They are focusing on the money and not the game, I don't see them changing anytime soon. I like fragger so I am ok with not buying more mercs for now, but I don't see a future for DB the way it is going :/"
Dirtybomb,3e26g1,Smiffsten,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:45:01 2015 UTC,"I think 30k should be the price for all of the mercs you can get in the starter pack, and 50k should be the price for new ones. As time goes on, drop the older mercs to 30k. As it stands now, the only mercs I think should be 50k are Rhino, Kira, Phantom and Sparks (if my timeline is correct, anyway). The game being in beta is no excuse here - it's open, people can pay money and the game is as good as released. ""Beta"" implies that there will be bugs and to expect random downtime and a wackier content schedule as they work out the kinks, but it's not a good reason to keep mercs that have been fully accessible by the playerbase at large at full price.  As a new player, you shouldn't have a hard time building up a solid roster to keep you hooked. Now that I know what I'm doing, it takes me about a week or two to farm up 50k just by doing missions as they come and getting lucky with when I sit down to play (if I can mash all of my missions just as the timer ends and it refreshes into new ones, I can make 10k+ in a night easily just for playing in pubs for a few hours). A lot of new players (I was one of them back in closed beta) will fall into the trap of wasting all of their credits on trading up shitty loadout cards, eventually come to discover that they suck and inevitably feel ripped off when they could have been accessing entirely new content.   The biggest thing turning me off as a player (which isn't stopping me from playing by any means) is the sub-par anticheat and competitive matchmaking. Pubs are what they are and you're a fool if you expect a truly coherent team every time you play, but in competitive it's another story.  I'm Gold 1 and win 80+% of my matches. Sure, I'm decent at the game, but I get paired against level 5-7's  who are silver, unranked or gold 5 at best way more than I should in a perfect world. I can't speak to the competitive population or it's rank distribution (nor do I know how their matchmaking system works at all), but about 90% of my games are complete 1-sided stomps. Another 5% is us waiting for the game to end because they have a blatant aimbotter laughing at us, and the last 5% is a solid match where the other team has some gold 1's/cobalts, know what they're doing and I actually get the opportunity to level up my skills as a player and learn something new.  The biggest draw for me to Dirty Bomb was its skill-based progression. I didn't have to spend time grinding up to level 37 to get the best gun in the game like Call of Duty, the balance is solid enough that even with a sub-par kit I can do very well if I play very well. I felt I improved at a steady and linear rate for a very long time without feeling cheated by higher level players with superior kits.   At 200+ hours now, that's definitely tapered off but I'm still hooked. There's still plenty more for me to learn. I've climbed the initial learning curve and now I'm focused on the more nuanced aspects of the game, like avoiding getting long-spawned, hitting perfectly-timed grenades and ever-improving my tracking aim. They got the easy-to-learn, hard-to-master down pat.  I think the best thing they can do is keep players chugging along that initial learning curve. Put mercs on sale or something, do more double XP weekends, keep pumping out things to do that don't require a relatively large time investment (like farming 50k credits - significantly harder to do if you only play a few hours a week unlike me), add more learning content to the game client, etc. Pick some community videos and have them be accessible right from the main menu. ""This is how to play Fletcher and not suck"" right on the home page would be pretty sweet.  I could go on and on, but at the end of the day assisting new players with the initial learning curve and keeping them motivated to play with accessible content is the way to go I think."
Dirtybomb,3e26g1,OperativeLawson,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:16:46 2015 UTC,"Anti-Cheat and reasonable boosters.  I bought a money booster for 8 bucks and the bonus is very very low, unless you are Superman and bring home a 10-15k score each round.  Also the new way of making boosters is shit, now it's not 30days  it's measured in matchtime, so if you play alot you have to buy more boosters AND be good at the game.  The Grind without boosters, you would have to play a few hours a day to even unlock 1 single Merc in 1-2 weeks.  Dirty Bomb shows exactly how a good game can be butchered by a decadent F2P business modell. The game is developed around it and not the game around the F2P Model, how it should be. A real pity, because Dirty Bomb is a great game, but the greed is real here. Almost everything in the Shop is overpriced to the max.  And let's not start with the stupid loadout system, which is ONLY here so the players have to grind more and more and more. You could've let people customize their cards, but then you couldn't make bank with nice sparkly presets with ideal perks.  BLECH!  More interesting maps, the selection we have now is ok, but more like cut bread from the supermarket. I remember Brink had more impact than this one and also more interesting maps. Right now we have many variations of an S-Form maps with 3-4 alternative routes on each. They look different butn in the end it all has that samish feeling to it. Dirty Bomb is all about mastery through repetition, but you could hang yourself out of the window a bit more with the maps. Be brave and bring a map which is truly amazing, with awesome dynamic objectives, or multiple objectives. More bigger better! NAO!"

Use your sentry as a decoy but only in a sightline where a rhino will see it and then hide somewhere or find a route to flank him while hes distracted by the sentry.  A good example would be the last point in underground where the barriers side objective is. Since theres a pillar to divide the line of sight, i usually put the sentry on the left or right side of the pillar while hiding behind of the pillar.  Then when a rhino comes and gets distracted by the sentry, i usually pop them in the head repeatedly with the smg-9. The damage from the sentry and the smg should be enough to take him down."

Dirtybomb,3e388y,TwoThreeSkidoo,17,Tue Jul 21 20:44:21 2015 UTC,"Aimpunch is a mechanic that they implemented to make it very noticeable you're being shot at. It jerks your crosshair and aim around when you receive damage, the higher the damage source the more jerkiness occurs. It rewards first shot advantage and positional advantage more then solid aim does. Its frustrating to higher skill players because it means you have an insanely hard time winning 1v2+ if you're being shot at by them and can sometimes lead to bad players getting kills by them going for bodyshots while your aim jerks around and misses their head.  To add to this, this is exactly why we need a PTR with some solid players on board who can test these things for SD, the response from the dev stream was that ""We really didn't notice the issue"" is kind of disappointing."
Dirtybomb,3e388y,vampwood,3,Tue Jul 21 17:19:13 2015 UTC,"It's also called Flinch. Basically, if you get hit, your crosshair jumps up. What this means is that the guy that hits first or uses the higher RPM weapon has a massive advantage in a firefight."
Dirtybomb,3e388y,Gas0line,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:52:39 2015 UTC,"Well, technically, they changed it to be more even across the board, it's essentially based on the DPS of the weapon rather than RPM. Whether it's working as intended I don't know."

Dirtybomb,3dzo8l,littlestminish,3,Tue Jul 21 02:53:42 2015 UTC,"And after the patch there was was a veritable upheaval, with a large departure of players with the update, this is especially the time when we need quick frequent fixes of little things to make sure we know we are heard as the player base."
Dirtybomb,3dzo8l,TwoThreeSkidoo,5,Mon Jul 20 22:45:32 2015 UTC,There was no large departure. Numbers are still increasing according to the Steam charts. Not sure why people keep saying there has been a huge exodus.
Dirtybomb,3dzo8l,littlestminish,8,Mon Jul 20 23:19:25 2015 UTC,"TB covered it around the 29th of June, spiking up to 13k, and now there's a ebb and flow but it seems like a slight downward trickle. We're below 10k right now. I'm not saying the loss is super significant (although my original post certainly implied that) but each weekend peak is smaller than the last in the last 3 weeks."
Dirtybomb,3dzo8l,TwoThreeSkidoo,4,Mon Jul 20 23:28:36 2015 UTC,"Just checked again. It seems this past Friday was lower than the last few, but before it was actually increasing (but not much). The charts are showing an average increase, but I doubt it's meaningful. Anyway, my only point was that there hasn't been a mass abandonment of the game...yet. I came from Nosgoth, so I can see some similarities between the two, although the underlying issues are mostly different (cheaters and bugs vs. long MM wait times and incredibly shit optimization)."
Dirtybomb,3dzo8l,littlestminish,3,Mon Jul 20 23:38:29 2015 UTC,"If we assume that all of the sub's subscribers are all former or current players, I think we're in a large ""wait and see what the next patch holds"" period.

TB brought the most players, hence the peak, but that's the only reason. It's expected for the numbers to fall down a little once the media hype is gone. Those peaks will happen again in the future depending on Nexon's efforts in promoting the game (it looks like they are doing that part). But those numbers do not tell the whole story. Take a look at this: https://steamdb.info/app/333930/graphs/. It seems that for the last month approximately there have been 15k new players every day, making an amazing 1.55M players as of today. Yes some people didn't like the game and that's really fine, it's a free game, everyone can install and test it. It's expected for a free game to have a large number of installs and a large number of players to try and quit.

He's fun, though, you should give him a chance.     I've been hit by a bug that shoots me back to main menu randomly every third or fourth match, suddenly, sometimes in the middle of the match, sometimes at the very end. I get credits, but all the XP disappears - and I've been 250 hours in, so at least 50 hours of XP ended nowhere. Also, I can't play MM because of it, it makes me leave the match and when I try to go back I just get 'Login error' and subsequent penalty. So far 7+ days of penalties so I quit MM until that gets resolved. But that will not make me hate the game. Seriously, why would it? I expect to play this for at least 4 or 5 years, it's not like I'm here to have several days of fun and then wait for Overwatch or whatever the next thing is. SD games are long term investment, DB is still in beta stage, SD team is not that big team so we have to give them a chance and support to make things right. If you are not ready for that, I am sorry, but this game is not for you."
Dirtybomb,3dzo8l,littlestminish,2,Tue Jul 21 16:05:20 2015 UTC,"I haven't stopped playing, to be sure. I wish TTK on the ninja wasn't so goofy (especially given client side hit detection) and the katana's animation was fixed. The problem with shit like that is that it will drive people away. The fletcher bug is more game-breaking for me because I play him a lot, but its not the kind of thing to make people sit back and analyze whether the game is still worth playing or not.  I'm cautiously optimistic that SD will begin to address my and other's problems with the game's current state."

Dirtybomb,3dzo8l,whatseiko1,67,Tue Jul 21 07:12:23 2015 UTC,I honestly think the public release is about maximising profits to cotinue development. That's why the main changes have been the loadout system and the shop. Also staggering the release of mercs may be some tactic to get people to buy more.
Dirtybomb,3dzo8l,KingMoonfish,18,Mon Jul 20 21:50:33 2015 UTC,Makes some sense - they have to make money to make the game. That's life - if the game isn't profitable then there won't be a game at all.

First Sparks was released, then they released Phantom who can one-shot her while she's concentrating on reviving things far away. And it's likely that they'll release Red-Eye next, whose IR vision will act as a hard counter to Phantom's stealth, making people want to buy him en-masse.  Mostly just conspiracy theories though."

It's a shitty practice, and is exploiting the customer, but it's a valid one that many companies use to make a quick short term buck.

Dirtybomb,3dzo8l,littlestminish,4,Tue Jul 21 08:50:52 2015 UTC,"It is honestly just good business. I don't blame them for it, because that's how most F2P games run their economy, see DOTA style games. I don't know if they will release counter after counter (I honestly don't know if that will be possible past Redeye) but if the character's are OP on release consistently, its harder to believe its a singular bout of incompetence versus shrewd business acumen.  They should er on the side of caution, purposefully under-tool the merc so that they aren't game-breaking, and buff them up to usability. That way people will be disappointed in the new mercs, but not outraged, and the same ""Beta"" can happen for each merc, them getting feedback from the community as to how to improve the merc. This however would cut into the ""impulse buy the new sexy over-powered merc"" economic windfall, you know?"

Just don't release Red Eye as the next merc. As much as I'd like to play him, if you do that it will look very much like you are releasing mercs that counter the previous ones in order to forcefully increase sales by making players feel like it is necessary to purchase the latest hard counter merc."
Dirtybomb,3dzo8l,TwoThreeSkidoo,26,Tue Jul 21 16:05:19 2015 UTC,"Also staggering the release of mercs may be some tactic to get people to buy more.   It definitely is. It's marketing 101. Product, Place, Promotion, Price, and Profit. The staggering of mercs is a form of promotion, if they released every merc at once people would pick and choose which mercs they wanted. By staggering the release they can promote individual mercs more easily (does anyone think merc roll call vids are just supposed to be informative?), thus increasing players' desire to purchase new mercs. It also allows them to release the starter pack, but still have a reasonable explanation as to why not all the mercs are included in it (imagine if they had all the mercs released, and the starter pack gave you less than half of them)."
Dirtybomb,3dzo8l,Leivve,14,Mon Jul 20 22:00:32 2015 UTC,"and Profit.   ""What do you mean companies make profit? This is unacceptable! I am a consumer! They are here to serve me, not make money.

Dirtybomb,3dzo8l,TwoThreeSkidoo,9,Tue Jul 21 00:59:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the gradual release of mercs doesn't bother me. Releasing them in such a way that each subsequent merc is basically a solution to the previously released merc seems kinda shitty to me though.  Honestly, if I were SD, and I really wanted to balance the game, rather than just focus on profit, I'd keep the release schedule as is, but I would also have multiple free merc rotations at one time that would pull from a pool of every merc possible.  So people could buy what is currently released, but there would also be a chance that you'd get Turtle, or Red Eye in your free merc rotation, i.e. set A: Bush, Nader, Red Eye, set B: Kira, Rhino, Stoker, set C: Vasilly, Fletcher, Proxy. This would allow all mercs to be tested at the same time, but still create hype for individual mercs as some people would have them in their free rotation, while others wouldn't. Then when you feel that one of the unpurchasable mercs is ready to be released for real you could put it into the shop for purchase."
Dirtybomb,3dzo8l,Leivve,3,Tue Jul 21 02:02:36 2015 UTC,"They took them off for bug fixing and extensive balancing. Not profit (initially).  Thunder was a weaker version of fragger, and they've been doing extensive testing with his grenades, and making frequent changes to it.  Stoker and Redeye could crash people's games, or just completely crush their frame rate, so they were taken off for optimization.  Phoenix and Phantom they wanted to do simple balance changes. (Though I guess they were having such a hard time with Phantom they finally just said ""fuck it, we need more brains on this."")  I don't know about turtle and the others, so I can't comment."
Dirtybomb,3dzo8l,DropZeHamma,2,Tue Jul 21 04:25:12 2015 UTC,Thunder was a weaker version of fragger   They don't seem to be bothered by Arty being a weaker version of Skyhammer. Other points are reasonable though.
Dirtybomb,3dzo8l,CORUSC4TE,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:54:51 2015 UTC,"To be fair he kind of is a stronger version, his rifle does shit tons of damage if used right. His ability is more about doing damage or denying area. its just a bit to weak to be used."
Dirtybomb,3dzo8l,littlestminish,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:34:55 2015 UTC,"Its not even about it being weak, its about the targeting system being literally the worst in the game. Kira has her clipping issues, but at least you can put it where you want it. Arty's lock on areas where he can drop his salvo is realistically on only 3 maps, and even then you have to put where SD has pre-determined."

Dirtybomb,3dzo8l,El_Ejcovero,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:11:02 2015 UTC,"I have to point out the straw-man here, the competitors are more likely to have a mentality as you describe. The ""idiots"" on the internet, basically the consumers, through all the verbosity just want a good working product and to pay the minimum amount. A good company needs to find the spot where their good and working product is at a satisfactory price to the consumer while still making profit. So as a matter of fact, the merchant providing a service or a product are actually supposed to produce and serve the consumer, then they get compensation."

They are just removing and reintroducing the same content they've had for years (and even flat out entirely removing characters like Thunder for the time being).  I bought Bushwacker before, then he got removed, now I have to grind another 50k credits to rebuy him. That is garbage. Hardly anything about him has changed, it isn't as if they're making me repurchase upgraded content. It feels like they're just recharging me for the same character under the guise of 'we removed him to tweak him'.  I understand they have to make money; but they shouldn't be charging (and at a pretty absurd rate of $10) for recycled content. If they were released brand new characters, or actually tweaked current characters, and charged for them, then ok. Then I could understand a staggered content drip."

Dirtybomb,3dzo8l,bonobosyo,4,Tue Jul 21 01:47:47 2015 UTC,"When you play a closed beta there is no guarantee that you will get to keep any content you unlock. That is part of the reason it's a ""closed"" beta. You got the chance to play before most people and you had a chance to get an exclusive obsidian loadout card that will never be obtainable again. The game might not seem like it's progressing very fast but keep in mind that Splash Damage is not a big team like they have for Battlefield or CoD and the quality of the game so far has been pretty comparable to those AAA in some ways. I played a bit during closed beta and I really miss playing Phoenix but I feel like they are trying to figure out balance as they re-release mercs instead of shoving them all out there and trying to tweak them all at the same time. Phantom is great example and I'm interested in seeing how he gets changed in the near future. The business model seems a bit pricey but the $30 starter pack isn't to bad (6 mercs plus 2 elite crates)."

Plenty of companies do it because it works."
Dirtybomb,3dzo8l,bathrobehero,34,Tue Jul 21 07:19:08 2015 UTC,"Agree 100% with OP. I find it laughable that they are trying to plug this game as a true 'competitive fps' when they don't even have the most basic functionality required to make it happen.   How they expect the comp scene to take off when teams can't even create their own private server is laughable.   Not to mention that the pass-worded servers they have so graciously 'rented out' require a minimum of 10 players, which makes them useless if your team wants to actually dry run or try out anything in an empty server.    Then there's lack of proper anti-cheat, or even any kind of proper demo recording functionality. And yet they expect sponsors and even players to put money into competitions?   The lack of maps is also quickly killing my interest in the game. I mean, Dome should have already been textured and put in the game by now. I really don't see how a single map should take THAT long. I mean, the thing has been around since the original early closed beta.   Then there's execution mode. Why the hell are we testing out an entire different game mode when the core game is still so lacking? Makes zero sense.  Also as others have said, the communication could be a lot better. Like, could we at least get some kind of a roadmap? Other than spruiking new mercs and execution, I haven't seen anything that concrete on if and when new stuff will be added.   And this may all come across as harsh and impatient, but I'm being harsh and impatient for a good reason: Overwatch is coming.   If the devs want any hope for this game to retain a solid player-base and grow a competitive scene, you cannot afford to be taking this long when an 800 pound gorilla is about to unleash.

Dirtybomb,3dzo8l,TwoThreeSkidoo,14,Tue Jul 21 17:41:44 2015 UTC,"The only other major change I can see is the UI change and the addition of the polished and functional ingame store.   I think there might be a bit of underestimating how much work this entails.  Though it's had some work, the bulk of development work in the past year hasn't really gone into core gameplay, but rather the support structures for the game: progression, currency and purchases, matchmaking (ironic I know, but believe me this one is hard) and other online services (Steam integration, friends functionality, parties, etc.).  These are all things that are needed for a sustainable game, and I think that most here would probably agree that those elements aren't quite purring along as well as we'd hope just yet.  I'm not trying to make excuses, but rather trying to explain the choices we're faced with in development.  Another way of looking at it is that we had a solid core game that worked well for the 250-300 concurrent users that we'd have during the Closed Alpha/Beta periods, but had a lot more to do to support 5-10k+."
Dirtybomb,3dzo8l,thrmoptc,2,Tue Jul 21 08:08:11 2015 UTC,"matchmaking (ironic I know, but believe me this one is hard)   Can you explain why it's hard? I'm genuinely curious. Seems to me it would be a data collection and analysis issue. Something that might be easy for Google to figure out, but not so much for other companies.  I imagine in DB it'd be quite difficult since players' skill level would change depending on the merc and loadout they were using, so you'd have to consider what three mercs they've selected before matching them...for every single match."
Dirtybomb,3dzo8l,TwoThreeSkidoo,4,Tue Jul 21 10:23:54 2015 UTC,"Skill ratings aren't difficult on their own but you also have to take into account things like how many other people are looking for a match at that given moment, how long you think it's acceptable for people to wait for a match to start, what's an acceptable difference in rank, etc.  Typically the rank banding gets more and more forgiving as queue time goes up in order to Just Get Players Into Matches.  It's another bit of balance that needs constant attention!"

Considering the first Closed Beta was in 2012, how many of you think that OB will last atleast a year and we wont see custom lobbies for several months? How is a scene supposed to survive that slow progress when you got several titles lined up both this year and next year that tries to do what DB does. I hope to god im wrong and that SD can finally turbo charge some progress so there is atleast a tiny hope this game gets a competitive scene.

Basic answer is because sometimes game development often takes place in the areas you cannot see.  In addition to the game itself there is also marketing material to be taken care of, creating and improving the server infrastructure, hunt down annoying bugs such as the matchmaking issues, level collision problems, balancing existing content, dealing with localization, working on pricing and store management, working on security problems and anti cheat, working with partners to hunt down bugs in external systems, optimizing the game, providing tools for customer support etc.   Nexon   I'm afraid you will have to send your comments to us (Splash Damage) and not Nexon.

The only Valve shooter that is a free to play game is TF2 and they had to spend a lot of time and brainpower to bring it to that point, and they had to make certain sacrifices (no ranked matchmaking, no real matchmaking to begin with, no rewards other than time based ones, two tier account system etc.).

Dirtybomb,3dzo8l,CORUSC4TE,4,Mon Jul 20 21:51:25 2015 UTC,"They are working on polishing individual mercs, one at a time, it appears (although who knows, given how damned awful Phantom is right now). It may just be a drip-feed economic style so every new merc is sexy and exciting when it releases, so they will get more people to impulse buy them with real money. All four of those are due to be added back, although there is a fifth one ""Aimee"" who IIRC had remote deployable sensors that were static on the map, although I don't know how ready she's going to be. Turtle is a deployable shield Merc that is going to be the 4th objective specialist. Super cool shit. I'm excited for all of the to be released mercs. I'll trade Phantom for any of them :P"
Dirtybomb,3dzo8l,littlestminish,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:58:35 2015 UTC,"I get this. But as someone who played all those mercs literally years ago, and have just come back, I can not notice any significant differences. Even the player models are the same if I'm not mistaken. Plays exactly the same. That is the problem, they're removing mercs for 'balance' but it doesn't feel like they're actually improving anything."
Dirtybomb,3dzo8l,Silverhand7,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:44:46 2015 UTC,"They aren't improving much fast enough. I'm noticing more bugs the more mercs I play, which is to say a lot of the merc have their own bugs. Problems aren't getting fixed, while they put out broken trash like Phantom."
Dirtybomb,3dzo8l,Leivve,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:56:00 2015 UTC,You obviously didnt saw phantom back before he got removed. I heard stories you dont wanna know that was a slaughter! He is just a pub stumper by now because no one pays enough attention to him.
Dirtybomb,3dzo8l,Koneke,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:22:29 2015 UTC,"I don't deny that the majority of his problems are lack of awareness, but the fact that his kit comes together so cohesively with little to no drawbacks, he's unbalanced. His TTK is too long for all of his pros, and he eats grenades for breakfast. SD should have known better."
Dirtybomb,3dzo8l,Leivve,7,Tue Jul 21 15:39:56 2015 UTC,"They are, they only removed them so they could make more money off of them than if they released them all at once."
Dirtybomb,3dzo8l,littlestminish,4,Mon Jul 20 22:00:02 2015 UTC,"They had removed Phantom because they couldn't get his balanced right, and they wanted to work on him without ruining the game. But we have seen how that worked out.  The others had either bugs or other problems they wanted to resolve in a close field."
Dirtybomb,3dzo8l,Leivve,2,Mon Jul 20 23:24:31 2015 UTC,"I don't see why they were removed, besides pheonix sounding annoying.   For rebalancing, pretty much. As far as I know, we're getting all of them back (and more)."
Dirtybomb,3dzo8l,littlestminish,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:59:37 2015 UTC,"Phoenix was like what Sawebones is now. And they were probably removed for 'balancing'. Skyhammer, Arty, Aura, Fragger, Rhino, Vass, all others except phantom and sparks etc, were all playable at the time too. Even Bushwacker was, and he just got rereleased and is literally no different at all. Seems like the remove them so you have to rebuy them in the future."
Dirtybomb,3dzo8l,BeardyDuck,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:43:42 2015 UTC,"Thunder: Throws (1) stun grenade. Does some wobble on your screen, makes you move and aim slower (they may be reworking because a sensitivity switch could render him largely noneffective).   That's why they're making it a flash bang too, so you can't see even after he gets you. Not sure if they are planning to have it reduce your speed too or not. It's one of those things they are toying with, but aren't sure how they want to do quite yet."
Dirtybomb,3dzo8l,elintepic,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:26:34 2015 UTC,"I am super excited for him, lets hope we will see some debilitating affects. I don't know how comp will like a character that actively removes your ability to move and aim, but CS:GO has dealt with it, and at least you can't cook the flash-bang as it stands."
Dirtybomb,3dzo8l,littlestminish,2,Mon Jul 20 23:38:46 2015 UTC,"Well it only last like a second and a half or so.  The difference between him and Fragger is; Fragger can kill you from afar or at least weaken you before you engage him. Thunder just prevents you from retaliating for a few seconds.  That's why they are still toying with reducing your movement speed or not still. On the one hand Fragger's grenades are technically better, and he has two; on the other no one likes dying because they were blinded and unable to defend themselves in any way.  It's a difficult balance, which is why they took him out so they can trying different things without ruining the game balance to much while they work."
Dirtybomb,3dzo8l,elintepic,2,Mon Jul 20 23:49:00 2015 UTC,Yeah. He's going to be an Aimpunch type of problem. Does his fun gameplay features outweigh the control he takes from the opponent?
Dirtybomb,3dzo8l,littlestminish,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:51:44 2015 UTC,"There were plenty of mercs that were removed and are slowly being put back into the game.  From the last CBT session and the 2 stress test weekends the following mercs were removed: Bushwhacker, Nader, Fletcher, Rhino, Kira, Sparks, Phantom, Red Eye, Aimee, Thunder, Stoker."
Dirtybomb,3dzo8l,MarcosPwnsNubs,4,Tue Jul 21 02:36:16 2015 UTC,Well since it appears the Dev team isnt working on new mercs what are they doing? They already have mercs lined up for release so they must be working on something else. But there arent many maps or any new weapons coming. The only new thing is Execution but that doesnt even have textures. Im really curious as to what they could be working on. Maybe its something big!
Dirtybomb,3dzo8l,littlestminish,6,Mon Jul 20 22:24:27 2015 UTC,"I would much rather have bug fixes than any new features. Then fix competitive, then put out another merc."
Dirtybomb,3dzo8l,imakeelyu,2,Mon Jul 20 22:43:34 2015 UTC,Yea but to me it doesnt even seem like bugs are getting fixed. I mean they must be aware of the bugs that exist right? The community is aware of many bugs so they should be too.
Dirtybomb,3dzo8l,madsenkd,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:43:34 2015 UTC,"I don't know what excuse or reason to make for it not being done on a faster schedule. Maybe there are more game-breaking but less prevalent bugs that they are dealing with, maybe they are getting new infrastructure set into place, maybe working on balance, maybe getting a real anti-cheat. Probably all of those things. I don't know, but I agree with you. I want to play fletcher but he has about as many bugs as I've seen on a merc atm."
Dirtybomb,3dzo8l,madsenkd,3,Tue Jul 21 16:04:58 2015 UTC,"Just started playing this recently(~10 hours played) and competitive feels like the more I play it the bigger hack fest it will be. Ranked at one of the higher silver placements and played 10 games of comp, 3 of them had blatant aimbotters(Skyhammers constantly wiping team when every bullet is a headshot). I can imagine it probably gets worse at higher ranks.  Aside from that the game seems pretty fun to me (as someone who plays a lot of FPS games). Pretty easy to dominate and outaim people since it has a nice skill gap to it and seems pretty balanced for the most part(not sure about Cobalt loadouts since I haven't run into any of them but i'd guess that some of those are probably considered ""OP""?).  Also, it'd be nice if there was some sort of notification about buying loadouts in the store for a Merc you don't have or not like you buy them until you have that Merc. I didn't realize I had to buy the Vasili Merc seperately from loadouts so I spent 17k points on a loadout to find out I can't even use it because I don't have him unlocked. Now I have to grind for 30k points and it takes a decent amount of time to do so. Not really a major issue, just annoying that I had to find out like that and waste so many points on a loadout that I won't be able to use for a while."

Everything is equal at the Bronze level and above. Its just cosmetic. Rest assured.  BTW, I don't like that you constantly get loadouts for mercs you don't own, but if you bought a merc and didn't have any random loadouts, you'd walk into games with the base loadout with no augments (most of which are just useless/don't work anyway). Its a mixed bag, but it'll work out for you more than it won't. Just be happy that 17,000 is all they are. They used to be 30,000."

Dirtybomb,3dzo8l,wazuas,4,Tue Jul 21 00:18:13 2015 UTC,"As I'm sure many people have said, if they stagger the merc releases it will (theoretically) keep a stable population for longer."
Dirtybomb,3dzo8l,littlestminish,0,Tue Jul 21 00:48:31 2015 UTC,"They didn't stagger merc releases. They released pretty much all of them, then removed them, then rereleased them as identical as before they were removed."
Dirtybomb,3dzo8l,pixiepopper,3,Tue Jul 21 01:34:31 2015 UTC,"By ""stagger"" I mean they are reintroducing them with delays in between. If they just put them all back in, yeah, it would be a nice spike in player base, but it might not be sustained, and it would mean they would have to start working on new mercs. If they just trickle the old ones back in, it will keep interest in the game just warm enough for slow, steady growth, while minimizing the work they have to put in to merc releases."

Dirtybomb,3dzo8l,littlestminish,2,Tue Jul 21 03:00:23 2015 UTC,"That's why I said theoretically.  To me, the Phantom release was a cash grab, meant to vacuum up cash in exchange for a flavor-of-the-month pubstomper. Since it's a ""free to play"" game where content is behind a paywall (either paying with cash or time) more like League than, say, Dota, it will happen again, it's just a matter of time."

Dirtybomb,3dzo8l,littlestminish,9,Tue Jul 21 04:16:15 2015 UTC,I'm just really disappointed by the lack of communication between gamer and dev. I look at games like Path of Exile as a prime example of how developers should be around the customer base. The lead developer Chris Wilson is on Reddit basically every single day answering questions. I would love to know what direction the game is going for the future especially since I like the game. I don't want this to go in the direction Tribes did.
Dirtybomb,3dzo8l,WyMANderly,16,Mon Jul 20 22:40:04 2015 UTC,"DB devs are here all the time, 3 or 4 of them pop into random threads and answer questions."
Dirtybomb,3dzo8l,MikeSeth,15,Mon Jul 20 23:07:20 2015 UTC,"I have to say most of the time all we get is a ""Something is coming eventually, but no specifics or time frame."" Their Dev stream (from the notes I've read) is about the same, such as ""Phantom is being tweaked, and we're looking at Aimpunch,"" but no one has specifics from what I've seen. I want to know how they are tweaking things, not just that something is forthcoming. Of course something is coming, they'd be crazy not to address the problems. If they haven't decided on how they are going to implement the fixes, they need to tell us that, but this air of constant ""are they really going to do something"" just makes posts like these pop up.   The subreddit negatively rallying together in criticizing the devs isn't good for the game imho."
Dirtybomb,3dzo8l,BeardyDuck,13,Mon Jul 20 23:21:07 2015 UTC,We learned the hard way not to post timeframes. There is only suffering and pain in that. Not sure what you mean with lack of specifics. There are plenty of threads where very specific things are being discussed.
Dirtybomb,3dzo8l,bathrobehero,7,Tue Jul 21 06:58:03 2015 UTC,"The job of a developer is hell, everyone wants timeframes but you can't give a proper estimate.

Dirtybomb,3dzo8l,GGDomination,2,Tue Jul 21 07:51:27 2015 UTC,"I understand your plight. Its really shitty for you guys. I don't necessarily need ""We'll have this by the 30th,"" but I read almost every forum post here, and people are asking specific things, and most of the responses from your team is ""we're working on it."" While that's admirable, I want to know what the direction of a tweak is going to be (you did give us more information about how you were going to deal with aimpunch) but people want specifics. That's all. If you aren't prepared to give them due to lack of readiness, just give us that answer and it'll be good enough for me.  TLDR: Just tell us what exactly you plan to do with phantom, not just that something is happening.   Thanks for taking the time to respond. This a good trait you guys have as a team."

Dirtybomb,3dzo8l,GGDomination,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:10:10 2015 UTC,"I think that the devs should treat this Beta more like one. They should put out the new (unreleased) MERCs for two weeks, one at a time and in the free rotation (without possibility to buy them), so that we test them out and give feedback on how they play.  Kind of what they did with execution.  Yes, they may be OP or UP(?) or bugged when they first put it out, but it will speed up the process and give us a more balanced final product even faster.  Just my thoughts. Maybe doing this will bringthem less money, I really can't think of another reason why they aren't doing it already."

Dirtybomb,3e1agp,boneknocker,10,Tue Jul 21 05:48:00 2015 UTC,"Phantom I can deal with, increased aimpunch however is bullshit"
Dirtybomb,3e1agp,JGStonedRaider,2,Tue Jul 21 07:01:10 2015 UTC,"Agreed. I was told by a level 33 yesterday that ""aimpunch only exposes who isn't aiming.""  I'm still not sure how to feel about that statement.  Are we aiming with the driess after each aimpunch disruption from an empire-9 wound?   Is there an expectation of control over the aimpunch effect that players don't focus on?"
Dirtybomb,3e1agp,peq15,2,Tue Jul 21 11:40:54 2015 UTC,basically aimpunch lets a player with much less aim kill another with better aim who is going for headshots (like veryone should do). He could be spamming your feet while you are trying to hit his head and he would kill you

Dirtybomb,3e1agp,SchwaD,5,Tue Jul 21 10:26:28 2015 UTC,"What blows my mind is that one Phantom, in it's current state, can completely imbalance a match.  You can have the most incredible EV defense and then one Phantom sneaks in, one hits your entire team, and then repairs the EV.  We had like a 5 minute defense last night on bridge and this happened... entire team was shooting this idiot and he was just hopping around like a fucking kangaroo one shotting us.  There's just no fucking counter to it right now.  I've never seen something like it in a game before.  It'd be like Valve patching in the ability for the Spy in TF2 to backstab while cloaked and take like 10% damage and regen full cloak in 6 seconds and so it all over again.  And then give him a fucking 1000 rpm machine gun to boot."
Dirtybomb,3e1agp,theduderman,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:37:38 2015 UTC,"The counter to Phantom is to ""git gud"" unfortunately. You have to be superior in skill to the Phantom and not get caught totally off guard (easier said than done if his sound is bugged and the invisible blur doesn't render on your client). There is absolutely no reason to have a merc that has such a low requirement of skill to be effective against the average player. Its not about people not being able to adapt to him, its about people who don't have skill beating people who are better than them, because they have ""the easy merc."""
Dirtybomb,3e1agp,littlestminish,3,Tue Jul 21 16:57:10 2015 UTC,"I've mag dumped into a cloaked Phantom, entire thing as a Fragger, he one hit kills me.  You can't ""git gud"" against a mechanic that neutralizes every 1v1 fight in the game aside from Phantom vs. Phantom.  I get what you're saying though, but this whole thing feels like Nexon wanting people to buy the merc as a method of balancing it.  And that's completely unacceptable for a game that purports itself as ""competitive."""
Dirtybomb,3e1agp,theduderman,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:31:37 2015 UTC,"Then you weren't hitting him in the head. He doesn't in any fashion one hit fragger. It doesn't neutralize every 1v1, it simply means you have to be better than the Phantom is on a fundamental level, and hope he doesn't get the drop on you. That's a flawed way of creating a merc in my mind, but that's the state of it. You can outplay a Phantom almost every instance of him, especially since most Phantoms are bad at the game. The problem herein lies that why should the average player need to be above average to kill a bad player? That stinks of poor game design."
Dirtybomb,3e1agp,littlestminish,12,Tue Jul 21 18:07:32 2015 UTC,"900 hours clocked in still playing dirty. Phantom is trash imp, does nothing but sit at the bottom of our game boards and piss off a few unsuspecting players"
Dirtybomb,3e1agp,bonobosyo,7,Tue Jul 21 06:05:24 2015 UTC,"Roughly 10 hours here.  I agree. Either he's sitting at the bottom wasting a player slot, or he's wrecking the entire enemy team with a score of over 13k points. Solely achieved by kills. In an objective based shooter."

And, while Phantom is a bottom feeder, his only job is to kill, seems to me they are doing it right. Bigger problem for me is bad engineer in my team or no medics and that happens far more often than annoying Phantom on enemy team."
Dirtybomb,3e1agp,BearPawsOG,5,Tue Jul 21 12:20:04 2015 UTC,"Well, the main reason for the high kill score is because of all the badges he gets for using melee. Fragger could get the same number of kills, but have a lower score because he'd be doing with the K121 and nades rather than melee."

Dirtybomb,3e1agp,IAMBEOWULFF,-2,Tue Jul 21 11:27:50 2015 UTC,"you see, you don't need a certain class to counter phantom, rhino is very good at it. If Phantom's chasing you, just hold S and M1, if he starts shooting you then try to parkour around him while aiming at the head, pretty much how you would fight other classes. Flecther is also another amazing counter, he runs faster than phantom and can use his stickies to do 90-100 damage, removing his cloak instantly.  While he's moving, he's not completely invisible, you can see him well enough that his head is noticeable."
Dirtybomb,3e1agp,7supersonicfan,5,Tue Jul 21 12:00:30 2015 UTC,You've been playing bad phantoms on public servers. A good phantom will never charge your face. Also you keep saying that he's easy to counter. What about medics in competitive? No chance. Sawbonez? Still weak to a good phantom.
Dirtybomb,3e1agp,IAMBEOWULFF,4,Tue Jul 21 13:10:06 2015 UTC,"See, you're assuming all Phantoms are katana-only bads. Good Phantoms use the KEK-10 almost all of the time and only use the katana for a close-up finisher. Thankfully most Phantoms are bad so I don't have much of a problem with him. Still needs a nerf  quick e:   he runs faster   Yes, in theory. But keep in mind that Fletcher is walking backwards and Phantom is sprinting forwards, that Phantom has his 'knife' out so he isn't slowed down, and that you can't long jump backwards."
Dirtybomb,3e1agp,LLAMATARIANISM,3,Tue Jul 21 14:09:59 2015 UTC,Anyone that says that really any merc is faster backing up than a phantom sprinting with a sword out is incorrect. There's a breakdown in logic.
Dirtybomb,3e1agp,littlestminish,2,Tue Jul 21 16:37:18 2015 UTC,Especially when you consider that you can't sprint backwards and therefore can't long jump backwards.

The whole ""Fletcher runs faster"" comes from the fact that I run with my sticky bombs out 99% of the time (its a thing every Fletcher should do). So facing a phantom is just about sticking him, run away ( yes, im talking about full on turning your back on him and sprinting) until youre safe from the blast radius, detonating and shooting him with the empire-9."

But they're also way less common.  As for them having the highest score, most games I still out pace them playing Sawbonez. I don't even revive a ton admittedly, but I toss tons of med packs and can often get long strings of kills before going.  You just have to adjust how you play..."

I didn't really like any of the mercs besides Bush and Saw, now Phantom is permanently in my squad. I like fighting other Phantoms, there are good ones and bad ones and I take it upon myself to neutralize them for my team. The people putting up the good K/D's with him are the ones who know how to use him. He isn't a medic, he isn't an engineer, he causes chaos in the other teams ranks. He is a disrupter of the other teams flow. Use him this way and you will enjoy the class. I'm sure I'll get flamed and down voted for this but I play just fine with and against Phantom."

Dirtybomb,3e1agp,TheNation55,0,Tue Jul 21 12:17:11 2015 UTC,You know that's not fair. He does take less skill but there is a huge difference between good and bad phantoms.
Dirtybomb,3e1agp,wak90,0,Tue Jul 21 06:39:30 2015 UTC,"The difference between a good and bad Phantom is far smaller than a good and bad anything else because Phantom requires minimal aiming, can correct missed melee swings, doesn't need to track heads as often and can brute force kills by running straight at people.   But all these Phantom players want you to believe it's harder than it looks when it really isn't. Like I said, if they wanted something to actually separate them from the bad players they could become proficient with the Dreiss. Or even the BR-16."
Dirtybomb,3e1agp,Exayex,-3,Tue Jul 21 06:48:16 2015 UTC,"Eh. He requires a different skill set. You need to know the maps well enough to be able to flank well. If they see you coming, any competent team will kill you.   I agree he had a low skill floor but as soon as people know what to look for he becomes really useless unless you get sneaky with him.   I have really good phantom games and really bad ones. Yeah you'll probably go even in kdr even if you've never played him but your team will lose. If the enemy vasilis know how to counter your routes and the team mostly sticks together you can be in for a bad time.   I think he's not good for the game as a whole because he makes it less fun. But I do think he requires skill to win with. And if you don't know how to super jump good luck.   I'm saying that yeah having good aim is a skill but also good map and objective awareness is also a skill."
Dirtybomb,3e1agp,wak90,6,Tue Jul 21 07:00:32 2015 UTC,Knowing the maps and knowing how to super jump are basic skills that can hardly be counted towards the skill needed to play Phantom. Those are skills everybody needs. Phantom just needs less skills that are required for other mercs.   Let's see how easy he is to play post-nerf.
Dirtybomb,3e1agp,Exayex,-1,Tue Jul 21 07:07:36 2015 UTC,Running straight at people and then missing a melee attack is asking to get headshotted.
Dirtybomb,3e1agp,SquirmyBurrito,2,Tue Jul 21 12:31:46 2015 UTC,"You don't ""miss melee attacks,"" you miss initially then turn into the person that should've evaded your attack. I will agree it is super gratifying to sparks or Vas to get a noscope headshot immediately after he missed the first swing (note: before turning to kill you with the tail end of the animation). The problem with that you have to trust the noscope randomization (not a whole lot, mind you) or just have to happen to have the REVIVR fully charged for a headshot. It takes a lot more skill to kill a Phantom in that situation than an Phantom needs to kill you."
Dirtybomb,3e1agp,littlestminish,0,Tue Jul 21 16:42:44 2015 UTC,"I've had several people miss me, and by 'several' I mean well over a dozen. Getting a headshot on Phantom with my REVIVR wasn't what I was talking about. I was talking about backpedaling and shooting him with my SMG, or quickly scoping in and shooting Phantom point blank with a headshot (or with the SMG/heavy pistol I have as a sidearm, or just oneshot headshotting him with a shotgun for Aura/Proxy (I haven't gotten a SMG proxy in a while). I don't really see turning and pressing LMB in the general direction of his head as requiring more skill than W+Melee'ing and occasionally longjumping."
Dirtybomb,3e1agp,SquirmyBurrito,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:31:00 2015 UTC,"If you can't see the difference in finesse required to maintain headshots in cqb with someone who's running erratically at you to one shot you, versus running at someone and pressing lmb or rmb, then I don't know if we can have an honest conversation about it. I will say you seem to more reasoned than a lot of the Phantom protractors though.   As an aside, I believe a sprinting phantom with a knife out is faster than any character backpedaling. Depending on the initial engagement range, chances of long-term evasion are slim."
Dirtybomb,3e1agp,littlestminish,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:03:29 2015 UTC,"You only need one headshot with a shotgun at close-range. A missed M2 on the katana slows phantom down enough that that should be an easy task.  I don't have any raw numbers on backpedal speeds, but I wasn't talking about outrunning the phantom by backpedaling. The backpedaling was to prolong the amount of time you had before he reached you which should give you enough time to pump out 2-3 shotgun shots (depending upon the range and whether or not you land the headshot). It is what I do and it works whenever I'm paying attention and my aim doesn't turn into shit. I do not have the best aim and my desk set up is terribly messy leaving me with roughly 7 inches of space for my mouse to move around in.  Edit: While I don't have numbers on backpedal speeds I do have numbers on sprint speed while carry a shotgun or machine pistol. On Aura, Proxy, and Sparks, you will be faster (even far faster) than a Phantom who is carrying a katana. This is because even 95% of 470 is faster than 100% at 410."
Dirtybomb,3e1agp,SquirmyBurrito,-3,Tue Jul 21 18:18:37 2015 UTC,"I love Phantom because after he came out, all the whining children are claiming to quit the game. Fantastic keep it up."
Dirtybomb,3e1agp,TyrantPotato,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:05:01 2015 UTC,...do you want the game to fail? because that attitude is how games fail.
Dirtybomb,3e1agp,Reddit_beard,-2,Tue Jul 21 19:44:45 2015 UTC,"I'm at lvl 7 right now, there aren't too many phantoms, so i just leave the game whenever i see one."
Dirtybomb,3e1agp,Tobbbb,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:39:25 2015 UTC,Sounds like a great way to never learn to counter him.
Dirtybomb,3e1agp,SquirmyBurrito,4,Tue Jul 21 12:36:20 2015 UTC,"i'd rather wait until he's nerfed. There isn't much counter to a one hit from invis, other than pathing or grouping, if so enlighten me."
Dirtybomb,3e1agp,Tobbbb,2,Tue Jul 21 14:37:22 2015 UTC,"Sure, I actually made a thread that would have helped you out but you know how non-hate phantom related threads go around here...  First things first, Phantom only oneshots 36% of the mercs in this game (with chopper!). That is 5 mercs. Sparks, Aura, Proxy, Kira, and Vassili. With chopper, every other merc is a 2-shot kill. When he attacks, he drops his invisibility.  Of the five mercs that can be oneshotted (with chopper), three are capable of oneshot headshotting Phantom once his cloak is down (two shotting him if his cloak isn't down, although in this case the first shot doesn't need to be a headshot unless you're a PDP-70 Vassili) through the use of their shotguns/sniper rifles. The two remaining can oneshot headshot him with a fully charged REVIVR shot or three-shot headshot him with the Dreiss (150 total damage on three dreiss headshots). So if he is capable of oneshotting you, all you need to do to counter him is pay attention and then shoot him 1-5 times depending upon which of the options I laid out applies to you.  With any other merc, things become easier. Just stand back and shoot for his head.   Special mentions are Fragger with his M4 and his nades, Skyhammer with his M4 and airstrike nade, Nader with her Crotzni and nades, Rhino with his shotgun and/or minigun (both are great phantom counters), Vassili with his HBsensor and/or sniper rifles (two of his three sniper rifles will oneshot his cloak with a body shot), Fletcher with his sticky bombs, and anyone with a shotgun.  My final and most important piece of advice is to make sure you're paying attention to your surroundings. Phantom's cloak is full of tells, and he punishes those who don't pay attention."
Dirtybomb,3e1agp,SquirmyBurrito,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:52:12 2015 UTC,thx for the insight. I play Proxy most of the time. I don't mind the invis actually. Its just the the times he randomly comes around the corner and facestabs you and the only chance you have is to oneshot him witch isn't possible because of his absurd tankiness.
Dirtybomb,3e1agp,Tobbbb,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:07:16 2015 UTC,"I can certainly see why someone would be irritated by encountering a cloaked Phantom when they turn a corner. As a Proxy you'd have to react hella fast and shotgun him twice before he has a chance to melee you once. To avoid this situation I usually wall jump around corners (when possible). It certainly isn't the best solution, but it is what I do."
Dirtybomb,3e1agp,SquirmyBurrito,0,Tue Jul 21 21:17:17 2015 UTC,Not to mention all the mercs he one shots are faster than him except Vasili (I think) who has the heartbeat sensor.   Want a tip against Phantom as a squishy? Never stop moving unpredictably.

Dirtybomb,3e1agp,Rafreakee,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:18:02 2015 UTC,You must be new here if you think Phantom is a money grab. If he was a money grab he'd have been the first merc to get re-released.

Dirtybomb,3e1agp,LLAMATARIANISM,2,Tue Jul 21 14:16:48 2015 UTC,They'd still have been better off releasing Phantom first if their aim was to get more money than they would normally.

Dirtybomb,3e2wk5,blablaadotcom,13,Tue Jul 21 15:25:20 2015 UTC,"We have eight movement states when it comes to weapon behaviours, here they are in order of accuracy (best to to worst):   Ironsighted Crouched Stationary Standing Stationary Crouched Moving Walking (generally un-used but bindable) Running  Sprinting Air aka Jumping   If you have the full cross-hair turned on, it gives you a very accurate representation of current spread."
Dirtybomb,3e2wk5,SmoothUK,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:12:36 2015 UTC,"Does ironsighting override other movement states, or is it a blend between ironsight and whichever movement state you happen to be in? So for example is ironsight + crouched stationary more accurate than ironsight + walking, or does the game just use the ironsight value for your accuracy in both cases?  It's just interesting because all but ironsight are based on the players actual movement and thus the player can only have one movement state at a time. Whereas ironsighting can be happening while crouched, walking, standing still, etc."
Dirtybomb,3e2wk5,Khaosity,2,Tue Jul 21 18:24:04 2015 UTC,"If I remember correctly ironsight is always perfectly accurate, but there's more recoil. I don't think the recoil or spread changes based on other movements states."
Dirtybomb,3e2wk5,Skyval,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:33:00 2015 UTC,"This is incorrect. Try jumping, aiming down sight and then firing. Your shots will have the maximum spread possible in the entire game. This might be a bug though, as hipfiring while jumping is more acccurate."

Dirtybomb,3e2wk5,trotsky187,2,Tue Jul 21 16:21:55 2015 UTC,"you know you can check each weapon in practical terms by turning decals on and strafing parallel to a wall while firing. Check the vertical spread as obviously horizonal spread cannot be read with this method. Basically its very accurate.  All weapons when fired from hip have a base spread and this increases when you  1) Aren't crouching 2) Are moving 3) Are mid jump or just landed from a jump. 4) Are firing your weapon  All weapons also have a max base spread. For example if you are crouching and holding down fire for the entire clip, your spread will probably still be less than if you fire a single burst off mid-air.  It's basically the exact same as RTCW or ET but with much higher RoFs on weapons."
Dirtybomb,3e2wk5,vampwood,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:50:56 2015 UTC,You are less accurate while jumping and moving. You are more accurate while ADSing and crouching.

Dirtybomb,3e2wk5,Logios,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:57:46 2015 UTC,Take this with a grain of salt because I'm speculating based on past experience but it feels like the accuracy penalty goes away the instant you hit the zoom button.

Dirtybomb,3e0cih,Duranous,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:29:07 2015 UTC,I'd like to see a system like Blacklight had: rentals. It sounds weird but it actually made the game fun for casual players and people wanting to try out different guns or gun attachments without investing the TOTAL cost of the items.  Basically in blacklight you could play ~2-3 matches win or lose and have enough credits to play whatever gun or gun part you wanted to try for the day. Put it in here for mercs and/or loadouts and make it so it's not too easy or too hard. Base the cost on the idea that most players will do their daily win bonuses and a mission.   Even just an hour of in game time with a merc would be fine as long as the price is right vs the 50k to own it permanently. A full day with any loadout at 2-4k imo would be fine etc. I get the feeling that they need more credit dumps any way rentals might be one way to go.
Dirtybomb,3e0cih,chrisorange,4,Tue Jul 21 08:38:01 2015 UTC,blacklight became a p2w shitfest though as soon as they introduced the heroes
Dirtybomb,3e0cih,themilanguy1,3,Tue Jul 21 10:57:42 2015 UTC,"Heroes weren't the problem. A lot of them were unique builds but none of them were inherently OP (except for Ghost and him being the only way to permanently unlock the HRV Cloak). In fact most of them are pretty terrible statistically, and all of them are losing their stats in tomorrow's update - now they'll just be skins.  Blacklight jumped the P2W shark when they started adding stuff like the Explosive Tomahawk and basically doubled the amount of defensive equipment available, then added armor and helmets that were basically straight upgrades on the stock gear. Speed builds are completely pointless unless you're absurdly good, just because there's so many mines and remote bombs and instakill gear that heavier classes can spam with impunity."

Dirtybomb,3e0cih,themilanguy1,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:32:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah, i wish there was a more reliable way to try a merc before buying him. Right now you have to wait for a free rotation and even then you need a loadout card to test a particular setup, which you are not likely to have since you upgrade cards of mercs you don't own."
Dirtybomb,3e0cih,croshd,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:14:14 2015 UTC,right but they would have to balance it so it's still a decision that adds up over time. Like some people trying mercs or loadouts over and over again would have been better off just buying it permanently.
Dirtybomb,3e0cih,chrisorange,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:17:41 2015 UTC,"While I understand the irritation that this can cause, making repeats impossible would mean that eventually you would no longer be allowed to make more cobalt loadouts. I would like to see a system that prevented you from getting repeats (of the same loadout with the same camo) until after you had already gotten the rest."
Dirtybomb,3e0cih,SquirmyBurrito,2,Tue Jul 21 12:21:13 2015 UTC,"I believe that's what OP meant by saying to make it DOTA style.  In DOTA, you can open ""crates"" to get certain cosmetic items. There will be (for example) 7ish regular items and 2 super rare items. If you buy 7 of them, you're guaranteed all 7 regular items, with no repeats. If you buy any past that 7, the cycle starts again, so you'll get 2 of all of them before seeing a repeat. Then 3, and so on and so forth.  I think it's a brilliant system, and it has improved Valve's sales of chests/crates drastically, because people are more willing to buy them with the assured knowledge that they WILL get the item they want (unless it's a rare item)."
Dirtybomb,3e0cih,ryno9100,3,Tue Jul 21 14:00:29 2015 UTC,"In that case, I fully support the idea."
Dirtybomb,3e0cih,SquirmyBurrito,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:54:42 2015 UTC,"There are how many mercs so far, 11?  And we're still waiting on 4 others.  Each merc has 9 loadouts.  In Cobalt terms this is x2 since there are 2 different camos.  So essentially, each merc has ""18"" loadouts.    This means that you'd have to get nearly 11 x 18 cobalt loadouts, either through trade-ups or elite cases, which is near impossible already, due to the amount of credits or funds needed.  So if you can tell me how it's possible to get ""the rest of the Cobalt loadouts"", considering it's extremely rare to get, or trade-up to it as a normal player, maybe your suggestion would have a little more weight to it."
Dirtybomb,3e0cih,SquirmyBurrito,0,Tue Jul 21 15:07:24 2015 UTC,"14 right now, each merc has 9 loadouts, with two different skins at cobalt. That's 18 different cobalts per merc, adding up to a total of 252. Hard? Sure. Nearly impossible? Nope. Trading up to cobalt isn't 'near impossible', I've done it several times and they haven't even been around all that long. Getting a cobalt from a normal case isn't impossible but is unlikely enough that I guess it is negligible (have a friend who got a cobalt phantom from a randomly dropped case, unfortunately it isn't one of his better loadouts and that friend doesn't have phantom). As for getting cobalts from elite cases, also not impossible. I've gotten at least one that way too (wanted a silver so I could complete a trade up, was happy and annoyed to get a cobalt). I am a normal player and cobalts are not hard to get. They aren't extremely rare if that is what you're shooting for. I keep several 'must-have' bronze loadouts around, but repeatedly trade up any other non-cobalt loadout to the trade-up gods on a regular basis. At this time I'm shooting for either another cobalt phantom or a cobalt vassili. I already have a cobalt sparks and ~2 cobalt Proxies. Not sure why people seem to think they're rare. The hardest part about getting them is farming the credits, and that isn't even all that difficult."
Dirtybomb,3e0cih,SquirmyBurrito,0,Tue Jul 21 17:39:24 2015 UTC,"Let me know when you manage to hit 252 cobalts okay?  The hardest part about cobalt is GETTING the loadout cards to trade up to them.   And don't forget the future 4 mercs that will be released along with their respective loadouts, making 72 additional cobalts needed, so 324 cobalt loadouts BEFORE you can unlock the ability to not get repeats.   I mean, this is ""not"" impossible right? All you have to be is a rich oil baron to buy all those elite cases, otherwise, you'll need 1.9k GOLD loadouts to trade up to Cobalts.  Oh, need I forget you need 3.24 million credits to get all those loadouts.  And getting credits is easy peasy like you mentioned so of course grinding out for 3.24 million credits shouldn't be an issue at all.  But of course, for a ""normal"" user, trading up to a cobalt isn't ""near impossible"".   I would like to see a system that prevented you from getting repeats (of the same loadout with the same camo) until after you had already gotten the rest.   Gotta collect 324 COBALT loadouts before I can stop getting repeats. WOOOOO"
Dirtybomb,3e0cih,Logios,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:49:42 2015 UTC,"Sure, if I end up with such bad luck that I always get the loadout I want after having gotten 2 of the previous 8 loadouts I'll be sure to post a picture for this sub. Getting loadout cards is easy thanks to random case drops. If you ever find yourself just shy of that bronze you need, just by a few cases. They're only 1k credits each. I'm not sure why you have a problem with my suggestion. Do you not realize that some of us may prefer one cobalt skin over the other? I'd be pissed if once I got a loadout, I was stuck with it at least until I got the other 161. I prefer the fragment skin to the anodized blue, only one of my cobalts is the fragment skin.  I'm seriously not seeing how you can have an issue with my suggestion."

Dirtybomb,3e21ra,ZenzotuskeN,4,Tue Jul 21 10:25:15 2015 UTC,"IMO the biggest problem with the trade-up process right now is that I have to use entirely different screens to figure out what I can ""safely"" get rid of and what mercs I want to try to get new stuff for.  I'd love to be able to mark individual cards as ""junk"" so that whenever I feel like trading up I don't need to re-inspect everything."
Dirtybomb,3e21ra,Terr_,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:05:07 2015 UTC,"What would be great as well, is if they allowed you to ""queue"" up multiple loadout cards for one merc, allowing them to be seen when you're switching your loadout as well as keeping the junk cards out of view, and have these never appear while trading up so long as they are still ""queued"" to a merc."

It is also already complimented in the Barracks 'Load-outs' screen so it shouldn't be to hard to move over to 'Trade Up' Screen :P  I'd also like the 'Mark Favorite' which becomes the default selection when assigning a merc to a party, as-well as mark as junk for easy ""trade up"" (those cards marked as junk move into slots for 'trade up' quicker or must be marked before then unmarked cards, but favoruites never moved into trade up slots)"

Dirtybomb,3e0x75,d1spatch,6,Tue Jul 21 03:03:35 2015 UTC,"I think execution, or de_ / SnD game mode in CoD and CS, is pretty trashy in this game.

Dirtybomb,3e0x75,chrisorange,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:59:47 2015 UTC,Kind of reminds me of TF2 Arena mode which I played exclusively since the mode came out. (1850 total hours in TF2)  Sadly that game isn't balanced around Arena so certain loadouts that would normally not be a big deal are a huge deal in a 1 life game mode. I will say THIS though...if you want to get good at TF2 like really good mix in some arena play every once in a while.  In TF2 at least: Good medics are important. Classes/loadouts that can just survive longer naturally are more important. A good sniper or two in Arena (the kind that always hit heads) are worth their weight in gold. On the flip side everyone thinks they are a good sniper...those guys are free kills.  IMO it will become something like TF2's arena mode which isn't even a bad thing. It's just a different thing. You might just need a few different loadout cards for your fave mercs.   I think there's room for them to get creative on execution. CS go has an economy that can build up or go down and affects what you can do in a round. You don't need a money system in Dirty bomb but maybe you can do something similar with what mercs you can choose changing if you are losing vs winning rounds...getting kills vs dying...planting vs defusing etc. Not even saying that's what it has to be but they have a chance to think outside of the box on this one so go for something that can be unique to Dirty Bomb.

Dirtybomb,3e1st2,JihadiWetDream,2,Tue Jul 21 09:04:19 2015 UTC,"I truly believe that if Splash Damage and Nexon want to win over the community and have Dirty Bomb stay in the long term and become a competitive staple, they need to roll back many of their current cash shop decisions.  As a replacement Spash focus on high quality skins for their mercenaries, not unlike Riot Games and their LoL champions.  With how Splash has made each Mercenary distinct in their identity the system fits perfectly.  They could also revisit the idea of ELITE cases, because people do indeed like a bit of gambling (LoL Mystery Chests/CSGO Cases), but the cases remain as ways to get rare weapon skins to attach to loadouts already acquired with in-game currency.  I know these ideas are rough and not entirely perfect, but I do think they are much better alternative suggestions to the current route Splash Damage and Nexon are taking.  A cash shop more a long these lines would probably grow a much happier and healthier player base, and one that may be more eager to actually support a developer/publisher duo that comes across as more than greedy.  With that all said this would be in a perfect world, looking at Nexons publishing track record they are far more comfortable bleeding a games community dry over a short shelf life, instead of trying to keep good relations with and sustain a community.  If we don't see change soon from Splash and Nexon in the form of more healthy content and balancing, I don't see Dirty Bomb surviving through the fall.  Much less actually continue to grow a healthy player base.  It still baffles me how Splash Damage can claim to love competitive shooters and their players, and then run to the arms of the Nexon meat grinder.  Good ideas go in, and unidentifiable crap comes out the other end."

Also to follow up a strong attack with its wide sweeping quick attack is brutal.  I feel I win more close encounters with the bat, may just be a psychological thing.  The bat is a quasi katana with chopper, its just a synergy.  With chopper stilleto does 102 with strong so that does one shot an additional Nadder or Vassili bringing the total to 6 mercs as opposed to 4.

With chopper stilleto does 42|102 damage and bat does 66|96, preforming the one two combo when you lead with a strong then a quick follow up the bat does 166 damage but the stilleto does 144 damage which is not enough as he has 150 hp  This is fairly specific but it illustates that if you do ""one-two"" combos the bat better, but if you only ever do strong attacks then the stilleto is your preferred melee.  Bonus points for stilleto being cool.  Edit: one more thing, the bat does 132 damage with 2 quick attack so it can also take out a skyhammer/Arty/uncloaked Phantom."

Dirtybomb,3e13dl,acousticdank,0,Tue Jul 21 11:37:12 2015 UTC,"That is true.  I think they should remove the instagib headshot.  This unbalances the play a lot.  By simply removing it, the Vassili would need to focus on the medics instead, which would change a lot imo."
Dirtybomb,3e13dl,Lathirex,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:51:59 2015 UTC,"Yes, but you need to be on point with your headlevel aiming. Use an assault rifle, the aimpunch will usually knock his aim away and if you can jump/serpentine towards him he will usually miss the headshots. Great tactic for medics.

But, most people I run into in pubs that play vasilli are pretty big jerks about it.   1 hit kill classes are always really awful to play against, too easy to be good at, and certainly have no place in dirty bomb.   I feel like the sniper should have been made like a cooldown ability or need to charge for more damage like it does in TF2. This way you can't noscope headshot and quickscope bullshit. Oh, and the fact that on top of that he can get some great micropistols is terrible too, because they're amazing in close quarters so he get's the best of both worlds."

Dirtybomb,3e0s4y,fireoftheabyss,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:45:07 2015 UTC,I'd say just give all loadouts 3 perks and make all higher ranks cosmetic only.   I think this would work pretty well. Considering how many credits you need for mercs it isn't like F2P players don't have an incentive to keep playing.

Dirtybomb,3e0s4y,TeaL3af,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:17:43 2015 UTC,"Ideally, you'd be awarded a loadout with a random skin, random weapons according to character and 3 random perks according to character.

Dirtybomb,3dx7ww,omniblue,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:53:17 2015 UTC,"That's not what he was suggesting, it's not that easy to recognise whether or not someone is AFK/hacker, especially if you don't die a lot, and because the in-game scoreboard doesnt show K/D"
Dirtybomb,3dx7ww,TemiOO,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:36:00 2015 UTC,"Only one I've seen was against me :( And I didn't even do anything wrong, I just kept going to the platform adjacent to the balcony accessible by the attackers spawn, but failing and dying.

Dirtybomb,3dzlqo,phalmatticus,3,Tue Jul 21 07:54:21 2015 UTC,Yeah: Playing Sawbonez well is an exercise in predicting where your teammates will zig-zag and accurately throwing your pack into them.  Not only is it a matter of dumb teammates--like you said--but the packs* are extra-effective on direct hits.  *Ammo packs are extra-effective on direct hits too.

There's no good/strong indicators where things like ammo boxes are, dead people waiting for revives, people with low ammo, kira's station, etc.  Stronger/Better screen-edge indicators would go a long way to helping situational awareness: This is one of the things BF4 did pretty well."

Dirtybomb,3dzlqo,mr_banhammer,-2,Mon Jul 20 20:42:53 2015 UTC,Crotzni isn't a great weapon. Slow fire rate and if you aren't super accurate it has a lower effective DPS than other SMGs.
Dirtybomb,3dzlqo,littlestminish,4,Tue Jul 21 00:12:33 2015 UTC,What are you talking about? It's probably the second best SMG in the entire game. It functions extremely similarly to the KEK-10.

Dirtybomb,3dzlqo,LLAMATARIANISM,2,Mon Jul 20 20:37:57 2015 UTC,"I own Fragger, but I'm horrible with him, not sure why. Probably the slow firerate. If you guys say he's good though, I'll practice with him a bit more.  I was looking at Rhino before, but because noone recommended him, I'll ask. Is he worthy?"
Dirtybomb,3dzlqo,LLAMATARIANISM,3,Mon Jul 20 20:44:00 2015 UTC,"Use the M4A1 on Fragger. All of his M4 loadouts are good because they all have Explodydendron, but the M93 is my favourite because it has Focus and the S&W revolver. The K-121 is hard to use, especially with the recent changes to aimpunch. You need to have some pretty good handling skills. Also, don't tap Q to throw grenades. Press 4 to take out your grenade, then hold LMB to cook your grenade. Cooking it lowers the fuse time so you can prevent enemies from reacting.  Rhino is very situational. He's the god of hallways and CQC, especially with a medic behind him, but is utter shit outside the range his minigun and shotgun are effective. He isn't as mobile or efficient at killing as Fragger. Similar to Nader, Rhino can rack up amazing killstreaks and be tons of fun to play, but Fragger remains at the top of the food chain. Also, good or even decent players will hear your minigun when it's spun up and find some way to flank and utterly destroy you."
Dirtybomb,3dzlqo,Blaxcraft,3,Mon Jul 20 21:01:13 2015 UTC,"I don't think the K-121 is that hard to use... I've been very successful in using it, and I don't even play Fragger that much.  Also, you can cook Fragger's nades by holding Q, you don't need to pull em out :D"

Dirtybomb,3dzlqo,RobertSummers,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:41:46 2015 UTC,I am also terrible with fragger (got him with pc gamer key). I got Rhino with my 50k. And i was disapointed because i realised that there is a certain loadout that you must have in order to be viable. This will cost you another 17k. But this loadout makes you almost as mobile as any other class but with minigun. Hehe  Rhino is situational and not easy to play. And you will be hated almost as much as phantom. So just fair warning.

Dirtybomb,3dzlqo,TwoThreeSkidoo,2,Mon Jul 20 22:01:15 2015 UTC,"Have you tried sampling them in solo mode?  To get a feel for their movement and weapons?  Another option is wait one more week for the next rotation of free mercs.  That will give you a chance to try 3 new mercs and maybe you will have 100k (or 80k) by then and buy 2!  That said, I have bush and sawbonez and like both a lot.  They both have good SMGs (bush's kek is better than sawbonez crotzni).  The nice thing about sawbonez is if you get the loadout with the 20% objective bonus, you can play the objective as well.  Sawbones has decent survivability because of his health packs (which only work out of combat, but out of combat is like half a second in this game).    Rhino is too situational imo.  In general, he's not as useful for the attacking team.  Not to say you can't use him, but I'd prefer plenty of other characters.  He's more for denying areas which is great on defense.  Plus his slow speed sucks when trying to get to the objective."
Dirtybomb,3dzlqo,Blaxcraft,2,Tue Jul 21 04:38:55 2015 UTC,Kira or Fletcher. They're the most fun to play for me.

Dirtybomb,3dzlqo,pecunia_opus,2,Tue Jul 21 07:05:32 2015 UTC,"You brought up a good point.

Dirtybomb,3dzlqo,Reddit_beard,2,Mon Jul 20 21:23:57 2015 UTC,"Have you tried Arty at all in the free rotation? IMO Kira plays a lot like Arty.  She gets the ammo station instead of boxes and her orbital laser is stronger than Artys but buggy on uneven terrain.  Bushwacker has the strongest SMG in game, and learning how to properly place and use the turret is very fun and rewarding.    I would say Bush > Kira for me anyway.  I own both and rarely play Kira.  I own Bush and it's a toss up between him and Proxy for me, usually.  But that may be due to my playstyle."

Dirtybomb,3dzlqo,Expiration05-16-2019,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:34:01 2015 UTC,"There are no ""bad mercs"" really. Some are currently bugged like Fletcher or currently weaker like Arty, but you should buy what fits your playstyle and what you think you'll enjoy. If you want mercs that are currently powerful in the competitive scene, those would be Bushwhacker, Sawbonez, and Fragger/sometimes Nader. But not everyone likes those characters, myself included. Bushwhacker should be on the next free rotation, so if you wait a week you can try him out. My advice is to buy the merc you think you'll like rather than the one that's considered the ""best"" competitively."

What's the point of a program that loads a number but never tells you that number ? This is pretty useless isn't it ? A user interface that never tells you anything about what you are doing is basically a very bad interface. :/ What size would you like the program to be : the size should be as low as possible, while keeping good performances. Period. In my opinion, it's not up to the user to choose the size of your app, because anyway you have to make the app as efficient as you can. This includes both loading times and memory size. But before planning optimisation, just do your program. I'd even go farther and tell you that, these days, memory is not a problem anymore, so you want to do Programs that just works as fast as possible. Most of the time, you don't optimize your program for size anymore, but for speed.   This said, I'd welcome a case opening simulator. It's a nice idea as a small project. What language do you plan to use ?  Also, I'll be glad to help you if you have any question or issues with you code. :)     I may have more trouble to help you if you decide to use something that is not C, C++ or Java though."

But we don't have it now.   And I never called for banning in comp. When you have admins banning hackers in regular servers they can't progress up the ladder with the ease and impunity that they can right now. Thus it becomes harder for them to actually make it into comp and get enjoyment out of the game.  So, no :)"
Dirtybomb,3dzgm3,CORUSC4TE,0,Mon Jul 20 22:16:08 2015 UTC,"But banning in pub is so much harder done by a community/admin directly in the game than in ladders/cups.   INGAME report feature in work.

Dirtybomb,3dzgm3,typodaemon,2,Mon Jul 20 21:17:13 2015 UTC,"I really think DB should steal an idea from Elite: Dangerous. They don't ban people outright, instead they only connect them with bots to separate them from the regular players.   I think DB should only connect cheaters to games full of other cheaters. Even if they use the server browser, they should be redirected to a cheater only server. They don't know they're banned right away, so they don't just make a new account. And they still get to cheat, so maybe they'll be perfectly happy competing for the best cheats."

Dirtybomb,3dz0zo,Qurest,14,Mon Jul 20 18:07:31 2015 UTC,"I personally think it's not that great, since the whole multistage objective idea is what makes Dirty Bomb so good to me, and Execution gets rid of that. It also, at least to me, doesn't really make sense with such a large player count and map compared to games like CSGO which pretty much refined this kind of gamemode to a tee, and it works better with CS:GO's much slower pace.  The attackers in a game I was playing managed to put the bomb on top of the bomb relay thingies at each of the sites, so that was kinda shit."
Dirtybomb,3dz0zo,Doidlewok,11,Mon Jul 20 19:28:07 2015 UTC,I think it makes some mercs more useless and some way better.  Like a Vaseline spotting everyone is great. Arty or skyhammer with their ammo are more useless given the breifness of the rounds. Also phantom with his cloak is very good for this. Sparks is more useless given most people will finish their kills and she can't keep them from being incapped.   They're other examples to but you get my point. I don't like how it more or less rules out other mercs because they aren't designed for the mode.  ........ the extra 500 credits a day is nice though
Dirtybomb,3dz0zo,The_Twan,2,Mon Jul 20 18:35:07 2015 UTC,Right on the spot. I think the mode brings out the lesser used Mercs into play. I myself play Vas or Nader. They are both master at taking out people at medium to long range. I totally agree with you.

Dirtybomb,3dz0zo,uncertinaffinity,9,Mon Jul 20 20:20:36 2015 UTC,I've played execution mode since it was ever released for play testing. I don't think execution mode is something dirty bomb needs.   Character classes that are balanced for stopwatch mode become useless. Why would anyone not play as vasili or phantom? 3.support classes become practically useless as well Characters have different movement speeds Stacked teams vs ransoms is a nightmare.
Dirtybomb,3dz0zo,ScrubbyOldManHands,8,Mon Jul 20 20:02:48 2015 UTC,"Personally I don't like it at all. It just doesn't fit dirty bomb's faster pace. Other games have done that mode (SnD cod, CS) significantly better. My opinion is that it is a waste of development resources to pursue it. Dirty bomb shines in objective and stopwatch with the multistage objectives and fast paced game play. That is what they should be focusing on, is adding content to the strong points of the game, rather than trying to make a mode that plays like an after thought competitive with some of the most established products in the genre."
Dirtybomb,3dz0zo,DucklingJuggler,2,Mon Jul 20 20:28:29 2015 UTC,"I'd prefer they fix a ton of other things this game needs than continue working on this game mode, but that's just me."

Dirtybomb,3dz0zo,Patriot_Brother,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:55:36 2015 UTC,"The only thing I don't like about the game mode is that it's best of 12.

Dirtybomb,3dz0zo,devinds128,2,Mon Jul 20 19:12:00 2015 UTC,I think that's because the mode itself is unreleased

Dirtybomb,3e00sb,twelve40,2,Tue Jul 21 04:18:43 2015 UTC,"I don't think he is that bad, I'd blame the awful melee hit boxes in DB  more then Phantom.  However I'm going against the Phantom is OP circlejerk."
Dirtybomb,3e00sb,JustiniZHere,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:40:29 2015 UTC,Look at the stats.   Above average base HP Extra amour from invis which gives him more HP than assault classes Above average move speed 1 Hit kill most mercs and a quick slash for faster 2nd hit for the rest Access to arguably 2 of the strongest SMGs Has a 180 degree's radius to correct missed melee stabs and still given the kill Can go invis which is arguably the greatest tactical advantage in this game   it's not a circle jerk when it's a broken hero
Dirtybomb,3e00sb,twelve40,2,Tue Jul 21 04:44:44 2015 UTC,"I don't disagree he could lose some HP It's 75 HP and Phantom can't attack while in cloak or it breaks so it's at most one extra headshot worth of health from most weapons, the 2nd will break it and do HP damage. Can't be sneaky at the speed of a Rhino This is fine, he should be able to kill 80 HP mercs, he is a fucking assassin with a giant katana. Blame the kek10 being op, it's not Phantoms fault. Phantom at one point had no primary, he should have stayed that way imo. This is the fault of broken melee hitboxes it's NOT a Phantom exclusive issue. This would be great....if the invis was any good. You can see him a mile away.   He is strong, I agree they could cut his HP and remove his primary SMG. However gutting him like everyone seems to want isn't the way to go about it."
Dirtybomb,3e00sb,JustiniZHere,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:51:32 2015 UTC,"With shield on he can take the 2nd most amount of damage in the game. (As a stealth hero why does he need that?) Can't be sneaky at the speed of a Rhino? He is tied in 7th place with bushwaker and sawbones at 410 move speed and just under fletcher and vassilli who are at 420blazeit, Rhino is 350.. you may need to check your stats Agreed he should (if everything else wasn't soo amazing about him) but with that ability thrown into the rest of his above average stats.. no, it shouldn't.  Even if the hitboxes were fixed it would just weed out the bad phantoms and the ""decent"" ones will still be broken. The invis is good, it's shit when he's running at you but don't tell me you have noticed phantoms 100% of the time when in a heavily contested point."
Dirtybomb,3e00sb,twelve40,2,Tue Jul 21 04:59:37 2015 UTC,"I don't know why his stealth blocks damage either, I don't feel it's significant enough to be much of an issue considering he literally cannot kill you if he does not break the damage shield. I'm sorry I don't spreadsheet all the speed stats in the game. So if he can't kill the lowest HP mercs in the game....What the fuck is his point even? Why play Phantom to tickle the sparks when I could just fragger, grenade them, instantly kill them AND gib them from a safe distance. No, it would fix the issue with Phantom being able to flat out miss his RMB stab and still getting the kills by flailing his mouse wildly. I generally watch my surroundings considering I play Sawbonez I do my best to not be killed so I can keep people moving, spotting Phantoms has became super easy and nearly second nature."
Dirtybomb,3e00sb,JustiniZHere,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:08:07 2015 UTC,"Ok so from this back and forth we have established a few things.  1) He base HP is too high  2) His extra armor makes him the 2nd tankiest hero in the game (breaking the shield is instant so your point about it not being an issue is redundant on the fact it doesn't matter to him)  3) You weren't aware he has higher move speed than you originally thought (you don't need to make a spreedsheet on speed stats but before forming an opinion it's good to know all the facts instead of guessing and making yourself look like an uneducated bloke voicing his opinion on something he clearly doesn't know much about)  4) The hitboxes for melee are broken thus making it even better for him considering he is the main melee hero in the game  So in closing we have both agreed on 4 things too strong about him, i would considering that a fairly broken hero in any respect and if you can't see that then there really isn't any point going further."
Dirtybomb,3e00sb,twelve40,-1,Tue Jul 21 05:15:27 2015 UTC,"Phantom  Pros:   Everytime someone buys a Phantom, somewhere, a kid with mild autism rages.  Wooooooeeeeeoooooeeeoooo Knife to meet you   Cons:   Reading wall of text from raging kids   Sparks  Pros:   I heal, I kill, Its ironic paradox, yadda yadda Waifu material Max speed Extreme range   Cons   low heal low hp Usually a high value target, so you have to position yourself a lot.

Whats the challenge with phantom? Everyone who is not braindead easily hits the top and a positive K/D rate even without doing teamwork what should be a main part of this game.  Hopefully they will nerf it now soon. Instead of playing the game I am already complaining about it in the www.  Next step will be that I am moving to the next game which looks interesting.. But hopefully not, loved old SD game so much."
Dirtybomb,3e00sb,SchwaD,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:06:13 2015 UTC,"Challenges I've encountered so far, aside from a wall of text explaining why he's OP, is that it is hard to 1v1 against an equal skilled player.   I usually end up using my Kek-10 to kill rather than tornado360deathwhirlwindthypoon. Only scrubs complain he is OP. I have played against Phantom with Rhino and never been killed by him so far.   A challenge for you, perhaps, when you purchased Phantom is to stay katana, never using your main weapon(I highly doubt that he mains a gun, more like he mains a melee weapon) for a whole game and get to the top(which is easy given all the bonus you get from melee kill streaks).   He has a decent speed, use the terrain in your advantage, and stabbidy stab newbs that block your path.   Beware of Nader tho, she's a suicidal bitch. You will often find yourself dying because you just want to finish off that helpless plump woman Nader."
Dirtybomb,3dxs87,SerJMormont,8,Mon Jul 20 12:21:21 2015 UTC,Yes and yes. Dirty cups has been running day cups for 2 months now and their first league is starting this or next week. Splash damage has said they plan to help the community as much as possible to make this a competitive game. They've already started by giving us private servers for scrims and matches.
Dirtybomb,3dxs87,Drunk_Conquistador,9,Mon Jul 20 12:43:24 2015 UTC,"It's a very small scene atm, and many who I've talked to or listened to are pretty unhappy with many recent changes made by the devs and the direction they seem to be going. Many don't have much hope for the games future.  We'll see how it all works out, but it's going to depend a lot on what the devs do. Not just in fostering the scene, but in providing a game people actually want to take seriously on a competitive level.  I can say some big things like aim punch, general balancing, and lack of anti-cheat are making a lot of competitive players unhappy with the game."
Dirtybomb,3dxs87,Keldrath,2,Mon Jul 20 17:09:31 2015 UTC,"What are people unhappy about regarding Splash's decisions and direction?  Is Splash not seriously attempting to grow a competitive scene around the game?  That's disappointing to hear because  it really seems to be built at its core to be a competitive shooter.  It'd be a shame to see another developer not answer the call of their plays to build a competitive scene.  I also recall seeing talk about plans to change aim-punch, and to introduce anti-cheat in the immediate future.  Is this not truly the case, or does the community just not believe they can deliver on these promises?  Beyond Phantom and the aim-punch I find the game to be quite balanced.  Not perfect yet, but it seems they're moving in the right direction, at least to me.  Here's hoping they aren't all talk in regards to addressing the communities concerns."
Dirtybomb,3dxs87,Keldrath,2,Mon Jul 20 18:29:00 2015 UTC,"They've been promising a lot of things for a long time that haven't happened yet. I think it has a lot to do with people seeing a lot of anti competitive mechanics added to the game and the speed at which they are addressing issues and people don't have a lot of hope that anything will actually change and if it does, will they do it right? If not, how long will it take before they do get it right?  They do want to grow a competitive scene and make a competitive game. The real question is ""Will they do it?"", not ""Do they want to do it?""  The most recent patch was the last straw for a lot of competitive players and many are taking a break to see what the future holds."
Dirtybomb,3dxs87,Mefistofeles1,3,Mon Jul 20 18:35:14 2015 UTC,"I don't often say this but, in this case, I think it holds true: we are still in beta.  We have an entire game mode that is just a prototype and many mercs that are yet to be (re)introduced. I think its a bit early to conclude that this game has no future."
Dirtybomb,3dxs87,Tiesieman,2,Mon Jul 20 19:50:41 2015 UTC,"CSGO took a very long time to really take off too, for example. SD should really look into what Hidden Path did to turn that game around."
Dirtybomb,3dxs87,Keldrath,2,Mon Jul 20 20:17:21 2015 UTC,"It is a beta, but that doesn't mean much, especially when it's already monetized with a cash shop.

Dirtybomb,3dxs87,salty21db,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:38:06 2015 UTC,"US/EU have DCups which is a solid org and is constantly being backed by Splash Damage.  Aus/Asia doesn't really have a massive scene yet, in Australia there's Cybergamer which once again is being backed by Splash Damage which is great to see, there are players coming from NS2, CS and TF2 so it's a great combination of players and playstyles.   Once a solid anti cheat is implemented I'm sure the comp scene will rise higher, it wont ever be on par with CS but I think it can still have a decent competitive scene that's worth investing time into."
Dirtybomb,3dxs87,kirenasura,2,Tue Jul 21 01:51:57 2015 UTC,I wouldn't play competitive atm if you paid me lol.  The fact that there is no anti-cheat pretty much just means it's based on who can use the hack/dipbot the best lol.  So in fact it does remind me of CSGO atm lol.

Dirtybomb,3e1dpw,GretSeat,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:17:55 2015 UTC,"Depends on the build of the game when the video was recorded. Phantom originally had the FEL-IX and was a worse version of Vassili because his gimmick of cloaking wasn't really all that great for a sniper.   Then when they replaced his primary with the katana he was super under-utilized because there was no shield with his cloak and he didn't have a gun other than a pistol.  Then during the couple of last CBT, even before they removed half the mercs, they removed him entirely."
Dirtybomb,3e1dpw,BeardyDuck,4,Tue Jul 21 07:36:04 2015 UTC,Sooo... who was thinking it would be a good idea to replace a sniper with a smg and add a shield to the cloak?
Dirtybomb,3e1dpw,Jessy0701x,4,Tue Jul 21 07:46:42 2015 UTC,"Whoever thought of adding the shield to the cloak, didn't think it through.  It even nullifies overspill. Hit him with a headshot for 9000 damage, and all that happens is that it disables his cloak and he'll still be at full HP."
Dirtybomb,3e1dpw,DerpsterJ,2,Tue Jul 21 09:32:12 2015 UTC,His effective HP goes as high as 344. He can absorb 74 damage from bullets and such while cloaked. Then he can absorb another 150 instantly from a frag nade. Then there's his actual 120 HP.

Personally I think the most timing-oriented weapon is Nader's grenade launcher. Most weapons in the game fire hitscan bullets, but the nade launcher fires projectiles with heavy drop and travel time. Nades from the nade launcher deal 75 damage in splash but an additional 15 from a direct hit, so if you score a direct hit you can 1-shot 4 mercs in the game, and 2 direct hits is enough to take down any merc except Rhino."
Dirtybomb,3e06vm,LLAMATARIANISM,2,Mon Jul 20 23:26:38 2015 UTC,Sparks has a revive gun that damages enemies- it charges up. Headshots can one hit mercs. Kira has burst and semi-auto rifles.

It's very easy to just buy the merc straight away upon getting the game and beat more skilled/experienced players with very little effort.  That's pretty much a TL;DR or what I've seen on here anyway"
Dirtybomb,3dzyz0,WinterEspionage,4,Mon Jul 20 22:15:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah, thats basically it. Vassili headshots me? Hey man, nice shot. Fragger frags me? Yupp, he cooked that, planned it all out. Phantom jumps in circles spamming M2? ..."
Dirtybomb,3dzyz0,Reddit_beard,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:56:20 2015 UTC,"It actually takes more practice to be good with him than it looks.  I first got the phantom and was like... well, that was a waste of credits.  I only kept with it because I did spend those credits on him.  After a while it clicks, you learn when to cloak and when not to, how to actually jump and bounce off walls effectively and not just in circles, and how to move in quickly and get out just as fast.  But he's not just a face roll, not if you want to be consistently good with him instead of getting a few lucky shots in.  And it still doesn't work against a halfway competent team.  If people are paying attention and sticking together at all then they can shut down a phantom pretty easily.  If you get out of range on that first shot (not all classes can be one shot) and stay at range it's also pretty easy to take a phantom down unless he is one of the rare ones who will go for a gun rather than try to chase you down."
Dirtybomb,3dzyz0,eeyore134,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:24:35 2015 UTC,"The entry barrier to Phantom is considerably lower than every other merc and that's a problem.

And why is it a problem to let people play in a different play style that they might enjoy more?  Again, he's pretty easy to counter and it's not as easy as most make it look.  I could easily say it's too easy to rack up kills with air strikes or martyrdom."
Dirtybomb,3dzyz0,eeyore134,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:51:59 2015 UTC,Still doesn't explain why he has a cloak that acts as a shield...
Dirtybomb,3dzyz0,GretSeat,3,Tue Jul 21 18:10:51 2015 UTC,"Easy fix for most of the Phantom problems would be replace the kek10 with the blishlok and replace chopper on the card that has it with something else equally as useful. Part of the complaints I see about Phantom is the fact he can one shot lower health classes but taking that away would just render Phantom a useless class with no real value.  On the rare blue moon I play him I make it my goal to hunt enemy medics, kill and finish them and probably die afterwards, but it works well enough. If the Phantom sneaks up to the medic he SHOULD kill them, it's his design same with all the lower health classes. Much like in a MOBA, an assassin does a lot of damage because they are made to kill single targets very quickly and that is exactly what Phantom is. I will say however they could probably do with fixing the RMB stab hitboxes, it last for waaaaaay too long and can have some funny beyblade moments."
Dirtybomb,3dzyz0,JustiniZHere,2,Mon Jul 20 22:49:42 2015 UTC,"Honestly removing the shield outright and just giving cloak a flat duration would be fine, as well as not being able to get the KEK and chopper in one loadout. Midrange skirmishes Phantom and assassin Phantom should both be viable, just not on the same person."
Dirtybomb,3dzyz0,nishahusky,3,Mon Jul 20 22:58:08 2015 UTC,"to sum up TB's explaination average health, invisibility that also makes him invincible for its duration, can 1 hit some characters and finish the rest with a 2nd quick slash and access to the  Best SMG in the game as opposed to a similar character the spy (TF2) who has invisibility but dies to a stiff breeze and can only reliably do damage with backstabs.  he is not such a big deal now that everybody knows how to deal with him but he still has an unfair advantage that makes the game less enjoyable for other players"

Dirtybomb,3dyjh0,acousticdank,11,Mon Jul 20 16:05:51 2015 UTC,"In my experience it never works, even when you just walk back. This is mainly due to the fact that a phantom is too close already and you cant outrun his second hit."

There are good ways to deal with a phantom, this is not one of them though. I'm surprised so few people playing mercs that don't get oneshot by his melee have picked up shooting him a few times and then stabbing him right in the kisser. You only need to land 3-4 rounds to the body and then a heavy melee will finish him off while he's recovering from his own attack. Works pretty well for me most of the time.  Now, this obviously isn't a viable strategy for sub-110 hp mercs. Those just have to rely on dodging around. Preferably by sprinting away from him or building distance some other way."
Dirtybomb,3dyjh0,Rexatyr,2,Mon Jul 20 21:52:44 2015 UTC,"He's not that hard to counter, but still annoying. It just feels cheap when he kills you :p  We'll see how effective he is after the nerve. I hope they just remove the shield and maybe maybe change his acces to smgs. But I would be fine with just the removal of the armour :p"
Dirtybomb,3dyjh0,infamousNL,-2,Mon Jul 20 22:30:56 2015 UTC,"From what I've noticed, it depends a lot on the skill of the Phantom.  You just have to hope to hit him in the face 2-3 times before he reaches you.  A crouch jump lunge from the Phantom will catch up to Proxy and Sparks pretty easily if they are running straight backwards.  But definitely backwards jumping is worse than backwards walking/running."
Dirtybomb,3dyjh0,SgtTittyfist,6,Mon Jul 20 16:33:41 2015 UTC,"hit him in the face 2-3 times before he reaches you   That's the big problem though. Even if you do that, you have only scraped off his armor, not his health."
Dirtybomb,3dyjh0,Xist3nce,2,Mon Jul 20 17:08:38 2015 UTC,"Yep, can confirm, full remburg blast takes off 90% of his armor. But when you're close enough to put a full blast into him, well... you're dead."

Dirtybomb,3dyjh0,SgtTittyfist,3,Mon Jul 20 18:49:00 2015 UTC,That is not good game design. There shouldn't be an enemy that forces you to concentrate half your team's firepower on a single guy. Even Rhino isn't that scary when he approaches.

Dirtybomb,3dyjh0,CORUSC4TE,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:04:08 2015 UTC,"After watching this video, do u really dont think they should have taken him down like 40 times? He is running around like a mad man, the first hit with his katana is legit without getting shot but the aware skyhammer, sparks and the UNAWARE skyhammer sitting at garage should EASILY take him down he is not a lighntin strike.. 120 hp 3o1 out of this distance? Mow that mofo down like its nothing. The sparks struggled with getting 4 hits in him as he run towards the other skyhammer. This video is a perfect example why phantom is such a pub stomper, no movement what so ever and aiming that could come from console gamers."
Dirtybomb,3dyjh0,SgtTittyfist,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:51:36 2015 UTC,"Getting in close makes it harder to aim weapons, since you need to turn your mouse more. Press M2 and spinning around however is still easy."

Dirtybomb,3dzp8g,Donut_Monkey,5,Mon Jul 20 20:58:52 2015 UTC,I wrote a guide on loadouts here.  The two most voted loadouts for Sawbonez were   CR73 Companion Operative and CR42 Original Operative   I've never used anything else than CR73 but the SM41 looks decent enough. SMG-9 is a neat weapon but many prefer crotzni over it (but there's some debate about that) Cool is basically useless but Get Up helps your teammates and Tough helps you not die after a firefight.
Dirtybomb,3dzp8g,mr_banhammer,4,Mon Jul 20 21:01:37 2015 UTC,"The 1st one is very good - possibly on the level with CR73. CR73 has Get Up as well as Potent Packs, making it better for being a medic, but CR42 has Focus, which is great for combat with the recent changes to aimpunch. Drilled is great for combat too.  The 2nd one isn't very good. The SMG-9 is basically a slower-firing, slightly more controllable Crotzni and is generally a bad weapon. The perks aren't particularly good either. Get Up is awesome, Tough is pretty good and Cool is meh at best.  tl;dr: Play with the CR42, trade up the SM41 for a silver."

I really think it's more or less down to him being hard to balance in general, having two gimmicks not really present in any other class (invisibility, and melee), which have to mesh with both the existing game and eachother.  Being as different from the rest of the merc pool as he is he becomes inherently a bit wonky to balance. That doesn't mean I don't think they goofed his balance, I definitely think they did (and I'd really like for them to be a bit more open about the whole thing), but I don't think they goofed it on purpose.  Either way, I'm not sure what their internal testing looks like, but they might want to work at it a bit to make sure new mercs work well before releasing them."
Dirtybomb,3dxwm8,Koneke,21,Mon Jul 20 15:27:41 2015 UTC,"This is a problem with the current business model of the game.

Now obviously, no company in their right mind would actually confirm this publicly, but it happens. A lot.  Normally the character will then nerfed when the sales have died down and another character is set for release.  It's a big downside of these free-to-play titles.

There was a huge resistance when Sparks was released, but now she seems in place because it's really cool to have a medic that's far away and safe so you can be rezzed right after Phantom kills you and disappears again. Heck, even Aura's health station was a huge controversy at the time. Just a little bit of patience and common sense. We have a studio that made such a great game, why would they make it worse for short term profit, instead of making it great for years to come?"
Dirtybomb,3dxwm8,BearPawsOG,3,Mon Jul 20 17:40:08 2015 UTC,"Dude, EVERY merc in DB is overpowered. It's just that type of game.   Yes, I am aware. And Phantom is significantly more OP than others, in the same way that Arty is significantly less OP than others.   we are used to them, we know how to play them   Neither stealth, nor a damage negating shield, are new mechanics. Phantom is nothing new or revolutionary. Planetside 2 has both and I have 100s of hours in that game. He's still OP. I will concede that I die to melee-only Phantoms (read: bad players) significantly less because I have good gamesense and I can hear them and predict where they'll go.   There was a huge shitstorm about Rhino when he was released but now we understand that all that is just a part of a bigger picture...There was a huge resistance when Sparks was released   The shitstorm around Phantom is much more intense than Rhino's was; unlike Rhino's shitstorm, good players think Phantom is OP, and it has lasted much longer. Also, nobody thought Sparks as a character was OP. She simply highlighted the problems with revive invulnerability.   why would they make it worse for short term profit   If they are indeed doing this for the profit - which, I'll say again, I don't think they are - they wouldn't do this once. They'd release a counter to Phantom, like Stoker, and then make him OP and get everyone to buy him. And then they release an OP counter to Red-Eye, and then an OP counter to that, and then an OP counter to that.  Phantom is OP. It was obvious from day one. (I thought it was hilarious having shit flung at me on the forums for saying that a character with 120 HP, the KEK-10, armour, cloak and a 1-2 hit katana would be OP. ""It's only the merc role-call!"" ""Wait to see how he plays!"") And the devs have confirmed ""changes"" (read: nerfs) to him. You don't ""change"" (read: nerf) a balanced character."
Dirtybomb,3dxwm8,LLAMATARIANISM,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:12:50 2015 UTC,"Ok... Neither is Phantom significantly more OP nor is Arty significantly less OP. Gentle tweaking will be more than enough for both of them to make them feel fine.       The shitstorm around Phantom is much more intense than Rhino's was   It's not. At the time Rhino got released there were 3k subscribers here and now there's more than 8k. The game is pretty massive now, there are over 2.2 million owners of which over 1.5 million that are actually playing.      It was obvious from day one.   That's exactly the day we shouldn't make our judgment about it. Learning how to play with such massive change in metagame will take a significant amount of time."

They'd release a counter to Phantom, like Stoker, and then make him OP and get everyone to buy him.    This is exactly what they're doing.  I'll eat my shoe (I only have one) if Red Eye isn't the next released merc.  Sparks --countered by--> Phantom --countered by--> Red Eye --countered by--> Stoker  Phantom counters Sparks by one shotting her from stealth. Red Eye counters Phantom with his IR to spot, and smoke so that Phantypants can't actually see anyone to stab. Stoker counters Red Eye if fire burns away smoke, and if not by forcing Red Eye to run away once the smoke is on top of ground that is on fire.  (I won't actually eat my shoe)"
Dirtybomb,3dxwm8,TwoThreeSkidoo,2,Mon Jul 20 22:51:30 2015 UTC,"Eh. I don't think any of the confirmed mercs are going to be hard counters to Red-Eye the way that Red-Eye is a hard counter to Phantom. It's the main reason I doubt that this is their strategy. I doubt that fire will get rid of smoke, and your 2nd argument assumes that Red-Eye players will throw smoke on themselves, which seems like a bad strategy.  Of course they could just come up with a whole new, non-confirmed merc that affects his IR vision. Or they could release another merc and then a hard counter to him instead."
Dirtybomb,3dxwm8,LLAMATARIANISM,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:56:58 2015 UTC,"your 2nd argument assumes that Red-Eye players will throw smoke on themselves, which seems like a bad strategy.   I agree, but if you watch any CB vids, this is what people were doing as Red Eye. Throwing down a smoke, and then using the IR to go into the smoke and shoot people while they couldn't see to shoot back.  It if were me, I'd throw the smoke, and use the IR to shoot from outside it, but who knows what most people will do.  But really my point was that Phantom is definitely a hard counter to Sparks. She was designed to sit back a bit on her own and revive people, which is perfect for Phantom. He doesn't need to worry about the rest of the team focus firing on him while he takes out Sparks, and his katana just happens to do enough damage without chopper to one shot her? Seems too obvious to be coincidence, or inept development."
Dirtybomb,3dxwm8,TwoThreeSkidoo,2,Mon Jul 20 23:11:11 2015 UTC,"That does seem odd to me. When the enemy is in the smoke their vision is obscured, making it difficult for them to hit you, but if you throw the smoke on you they know you're in there somewhere, so they'll just spray all over the place while bunnyhopping so you can't snipe them. At least that's what I'd do.  I do agree with you about Phantom and Sparks. I don't think they should nerf the damage but it definitely needs to be hard to use, like they said it would be in the merc role-call. I did some testing earlier today on those secondary objective boxes and I could right-click, and then a full second later move my crosshair onto the box and have it hit the box (you could hear the metallic noise of it hitting it)."
Dirtybomb,3dxwm8,LLAMATARIANISM,2,Mon Jul 20 23:16:48 2015 UTC,"IMO they need to disable RMB attacks from cloak (LMB would be fine), get rid of the chopper augment, fix the time period for hit registration, and disallow multi-hit RMB attacks (because realistically how many people can a katana stab through? maybe 2?).   This way you can still use the cloak to flank, but have to disable it if you want to do a flying long jump stabbity stab attack. This would also make it so that the long jump + RMB doesn't also have the advantage of extra armor. It's bad enough that it's almost impossible for the fastest classes to backpedal away from it. This would make it so that at least if you see the Phantom coming you have an opportunity to actually take him out if your aim is good. As for LMB attacks, you can still slash from cloak, and if you want to try you can slash multiple enemies at once (which kinda sorta seems logical)."

With Nexon as the publisher there's a potential for anti-consumer practices, and it should be avoided.  I don't think we can make this conclusion though, Sparks was, and still is, considered a bit weak. Same goes with Fletcher. Phantom is obviously hard to balance so I don't think it was a cash grab."

Dirtybomb,3dxwm8,dieezus,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:55:12 2015 UTC,"I don't see them intentionally making overpowered champs. I think during internal testing they thought he was balanced and fun to play/play against. The problem is that even huge developers don't have the proper play test resources to even come close to the player base of a popular game, let alone a small dev. So the hours of internal playtesting are eclipsed within the first hour of a new mercs release. The public finds flaws, bugs, OP mercs, UP mercs, way faster than the devs could. They also can never reproduce the massive difference in play styles that games like this have among its players.   TLDR: Hard to test every facet of a merc before release with such a small dev team."
Dirtybomb,3dxwm8,TesserTheLost,0,Mon Jul 20 19:00:38 2015 UTC,"It is a bad business model, I agree.   However, what makes it worse is this practice of selling mercs for cash in a BETA game that obviously needs some balancing work. I mean, Sparks is banned from current comps for fucks sake. When the game is in open beta, content should be free so that the majority of the community can playtest them (since by SD's own admission even though they played him for days/weeks things still slip through within minutes of them being released to the masses). This just screams cash grab. There's also been little change to anything between closed/open beta even with all the info that was given during closed beta.  When the game gets released, and most balancing passes have been made on guns/mercs/perks etc., from data gathered by ALL people playing closed then open BETA....then charge for money. Then people don't feel like they got ripped off when you nerf something into the ground after ppl have spent money on it. You get one chance to make your first impression, and this hasn't really done SD any good. It looks like a desperate move for quick cash.  Said it before and I'll say it again, it makes me eagerly await Overwatch even more."
Dirtybomb,3dxwm8,-sYmbiont-,2,Mon Jul 20 19:26:33 2015 UTC,She's banned in the Dirty Cups because there's a bug with her revive gun and the damage it does to EVs. It has nothing to do with her ability to range revive.
Dirtybomb,3dxwm8,nokill_,0,Mon Jul 20 20:12:30 2015 UTC,I know why she's banned. Did I say anything about range reviving? I mean that's the whole point of her revive gun correct?
Dirtybomb,3dxwm8,-sYmbiont-,2,Mon Jul 20 20:36:17 2015 UTC,"You implied, she's banned for the Dirty Cups, because of her abilities, not because there's a bug. It's a big difference that."
Dirtybomb,3dxwm8,nokill_,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:23:49 2015 UTC,I doubt the next mercs are gonna be as overpowered as Phantom.
Dirtybomb,3dxwm8,Mefistofeles1,4,Mon Jul 20 19:58:54 2015 UTC,"It does seem like that.    If I had to balance Phantom I'd say if they wanted to keep him stealthy he should be proxy level health and no damage resistance ( but maybe additional delay to traps and turrets while cloaked ).   Or, change his name to Bulwark, lose the cloaking, keep the shield, and make him a tanky melee fighter."
Dirtybomb,3dxwm8,narcolepticnine,2,Mon Jul 20 18:41:55 2015 UTC,"Hopefully something can be a bit more balanced. Nothing worse than playing with your team in MM and playing vs 3 phantom which happened to us. Trying to get the EV on Bridge was a pain because you had 2 phantoms always pushing while one camped hiding waiting to knife one of us building.  I don't care for them on public gameplay as such as most of the time the merc is pretty useless (player side), just can be a little 'unfair'/P2W lolol then, but maybe limiting it 1 team somehow in MM? sure. I've seen phantom banned in small cups already too"
Dirtybomb,3dxwm8,PaNdaRat0r666,5,Mon Jul 20 14:52:02 2015 UTC,"I really enjoy playing Phantom, but only in certain scenarios.   When we are Defending and I'm on a competent team, where I don't have to be Bush or Saw for the entire round, I'll take Phantom behind enemy lines and cause as much havoc as possible. Nothing kills an attacking teams morale more than getting sliced up before you even make it to the nearest objective combat area.   Right now, I think they are trying to figure out some kind of balance with him by introducing him to the wild and using those results to figure out how to launch their next line of new mercs."
Dirtybomb,3dxwm8,TheNation55,10,Mon Jul 20 13:34:12 2015 UTC,"The thing is, each merc should be fun to play as but also should be fun to play against. Or at least tolerable to play against. Otherwise mercs takes fun out of the game instead of adding it. That should be the number one priority when designing mercs."
Dirtybomb,3dxwm8,bathrobehero,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:20:52 2015 UTC,"True, but you also have to remember that apparently all the mercs that can counter Phantom aren't even in the game yet, except Vassili and his heartbeat sensor."
Dirtybomb,3dxwm8,TheNation55,3,Mon Jul 20 15:37:52 2015 UTC,"I have't played that much of the game but to be honest I think Vasilli is the only other merc that has a negative-sum fun factor. Sure, it's enjoyable to play as him but it sure as hell not enjoyable to play against him. Partly because the vast majority of the time Vasilli will kill you without you having a chance to fight back. He's just not fun and I don't think his style fits into the game but that's just me."
Dirtybomb,3dxwm8,bathrobehero,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:48:53 2015 UTC,"Eh, it wouldn't be a FPS without some kind of sniper class.   His heartbeat sensor is pretty clutch in defending certain objectives with multiple entry ways.   I never use him though, when the opposing team has a person camping in the back with him, I just use Phantom and go stab him in the face over and over, usually they are scoped in and never pay attention to their surroundings. I'll do that until I see no more Vasili's on the other team :)"
Dirtybomb,3dxwm8,TheNation55,2,Mon Jul 20 16:08:55 2015 UTC,"Eh, it wouldn't be a FPS without some kind of sniper class.   Why? Because no game has had the balls to challenge that old notion? Every tradition is set in stone until someone decides that they don't have to follow it just because.  I also find it hilarious that you suggest using Phantom to kill him, even tough Vassili should be a counter to him. But who are we kidding, nothing truly counters Phantom."
Dirtybomb,3dxwm8,Mefistofeles1,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:06:11 2015 UTC,"Most think they are safe at the edge of combat, so they never use the heart beat sensor to cover themselves.

Dirtybomb,3dxwm8,TwoThreeSkidoo,6,Mon Jul 20 22:55:49 2015 UTC,"It has been suggested that Phantom was tested internally while the testers were communicating with voip. On pub games where no one communicates Phantom really is a pain in the ass.  I hope he will be tweaked but not nerfed. I don't want him to be less powerful, I want him powerful but in a good way. He should be tweaked so people can't tank with him but can still sneak, ambush and take out key targets. Which is how he's intended to be played.  SD also said the damage shield was designed to let people protect their teammates from nades, sniper shots etc... But it doesn't work. I tried it. They may want to look into this."
Dirtybomb,3dxwm8,CaptainShaky,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:49:12 2015 UTC,Causing even 2 enemies to have to hunt you down is well worth it. Especially if you manage to kill any on their way to the objective.
Dirtybomb,3dxwm8,lispychicken,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:22:36 2015 UTC,"Yep, I rarely fight with Phantom on or near the objective unless its to defuse or stop a carrier (meet them at the planting point while cloaked).

Dirtybomb,3dxwm8,TheGamblerBR,5,Mon Jul 20 14:15:28 2015 UTC,"Hard counters are fine in free selection, but we have both purchased characters and limited selection after, so you are correct that counter play is more valuable."

Dirtybomb,3dxwm8,Alphadef,2,Mon Jul 20 14:54:38 2015 UTC,"My gripe with counter mercs/heroes/champions/whatever on free selection is that the one being countered usually feels helpless against the enemy, making it unfun for him."

Dirtybomb,3dxwm8,Alphadef,3,Mon Jul 20 17:31:19 2015 UTC,"In this video I survive at 8 hp for a bit longer than I should have (enough to rekill the first guy)  http://www.gfycat.com/UntriedHandmadeJuliabutterfly  I wouldn't say he's completely overpowered, but it is easier to own people than probably any other class.  People like to mention Fragger, but he still takes decent aim, timing, and situational awareness.  Phantom is Q spec ability 1 + M2 stab stab stab.  I believe damage shield should be gone, and make his invisibility last longer and cool down slower.  Most of the other things are fine."
Dirtybomb,3dxwm8,acousticdank,4,Mon Jul 20 15:37:05 2015 UTC,"That's a good video, because you were playing terribly and were still able to take out 2 people.

Dirtybomb,3dxwm8,acousticdank,2,Mon Jul 20 18:15:49 2015 UTC,"I meant shooting a gun, you can't actually headshot with melee. I was just trying to say you didn't need Phantom to pull that off, even though you could have done it better even with Phantom. The Skyhammers were standing still, so if you pulled out your KEK you could have downed them in a second or less. Alternatively, using  the katana's quick attack would have been more effective."
Dirtybomb,3dxwm8,Fire42uck,2,Mon Jul 20 19:28:33 2015 UTC,"Ah yeah, that makes sense.    edit: just wanted to stab"
Dirtybomb,3dxwm8,acousticdank,7,Mon Jul 20 19:57:40 2015 UTC,"Thing is he really isn't op, he's just good at killing players who aren't used to dealing with him. More skilled players whomp on him like he's nothing.  This is my issue personally, he should be flexible enough to be used in both environments, but be hard to use or hard to master. Infiltrator was honestly the best stealth class I've seen, TF2 Spy is woefully underpowered if only because the time it takes for him to actually make a move, compared to the effort it takes to ruin all that, it's pretty unbalanced.  Try playing Spy now in either Highlander or pubs, it's spammy as hell, and literally everything you do can be done better by a Sniper or Scout."
Dirtybomb,3dxwm8,Watsyurdeal,4,Mon Jul 20 14:06:52 2015 UTC,"Infiltrator was honestly the best stealth class I've seen,   You mean Planetside 2 infiltrator? Because the infil in Planetside is really bad at being a stealth class. If you've got a decent amount of skill, the recon allows you to wreck shit, but the stealth is just useless. Hunter cloak is only useful for travelling across open spaces to get to indoor areas where you can actually be effective. It's noisy as fuck and you can still be seen really easily.  Cloak in Planetside is only useful for Stalker cloakers and snipers, neither of which contribute to the team."
Dirtybomb,3dxwm8,LLAMATARIANISM,2,Mon Jul 20 14:45:10 2015 UTC,"No I mean Tribes Infiltrator, sorry  He was still useful even in competitive play as harasser, flag clearer, picks, he could do a lot for the team without being easily shut down.

The fact that I've never seen a single Phantom using anything other than the Katana indicates issues to me.   Also, in regards to the TF2 Spy... It fills a far more specialised role than any sniper or scout could fill. Yes, plenty of unskilled players spam him but they don't achieve any results whatsoever, it's the complete opposite for Phantom. Snipers require line of sight and scouts can be seen, intercepted, and hit a roadblock if they run into a turret... The Spy can operate anywhere on the battlefield and has a completely different set of counters."
Dirtybomb,3dxwm8,SowakaWaka,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:19:19 2015 UTC,"But the Spy also a lot of specific counter like Razorback and Homewrecker, and all of them add up to the Spy pretty much being a waste. If the Spy didn't have to put up with all this crap he probably could stand a chance.  But the reality is if the enemy team wants to deal with the Spy, they have unlocks specifically for him, which is stupid to me. That and Splash have said they don't want any x merc counters y merc relationships, soft is fine, but a hard counter that shuts another down seems to be out of the question.  So hopefully we'll see, I'm hoping they'll take notes from Tribes, honestly the most effective stealth class I've seen. Limited yes but still potent enough to be useful in any level of play."

I bought phantom day one because i loved tf2 spy but going on a killstreak on spy require skills going on a killstreak on phantom just feels cheap because all i have to do is take one of the numerous side path to go behind the enemy team and feast on the poor aura/sparks/vasilli and if i get caught np, ill just cloack and run away and if they chase me my team is probably going to take the objective while i wait around the corner for the one that chase me and kill him in 1 hit.

Dirtybomb,3dxwm8,Grappa91,3,Mon Jul 20 13:59:38 2015 UTC,"You do make a good point. A team (or even two players) that is even a little bit organized, pose a fair threat for Phantom. Don't get me wrong, I like the concept and character, but I don't see the whole Refractive Armor also adding to the bullet-spongyness of him. If they only removed this factor, I think it would restore Balance. Maybe even add 10 points to his speed or something. In my opinion, cloaking technology isn't a shield as well."

Dirtybomb,3dxwm8,Kagekire,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:01:15 2015 UTC,"If you take away his shield, he needs complete invisibility, or at least the removal of the loud buzzing of his stealth. That would be far more unfun and unbalanced. This state of phantom has a lot more counterplay."
Dirtybomb,3dxwm8,Terr_,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:47:42 2015 UTC,"I'm left wondering if-or-how they will remedy this class?!   I think if he gets hit while cloaked, it should harm his ability to attack. This way he can still assassinate enemies and run away, but he loses his advantage if he's too ""LOL I JUEMP AT U FACE"" obvious about it.   My problem is that the Refractive Armor shouldn't absorb damage as well, that's just plain bullshit.   I agree it's bullshit 99% of the way people are using it right now,  but I think it could have valid uses:   As a panic button to escape when discovered deep behind enemy lines To make it so that mines in his path are an impediment but not a complete shut-out   The problem is ensuring the refractive-armor is only used in the ""right"" way."
Dirtybomb,3dxwm8,bathrobehero,0,Mon Jul 20 17:27:14 2015 UTC,At this point I think the sole reason behind Phantom is SD's unprofessionality.
Dirtybomb,3dxwm8,Gas0line,-3,Mon Jul 20 15:15:18 2015 UTC,"It's either malice or stupidity.  And generally, don't attribute to malice what can be explained by stupidity.  However, Phantom has been in the game for close to 2 weeks now, and although change has been hinted at, it doesn't seem to be forthcoming.  As time goes on the likelihood of malice increases."

Dirtybomb,3dxwm8,Akblabla,0,Mon Jul 20 13:30:39 2015 UTC,"Phantom is really, really underpowered for actual competitive gameplay. In most cases he is just a slightly more direct-combat focused bushwacker with no utility for the team. His sword is in most cases almost useless, as it is really easy to backpedal and just headshot him, because he needs to run straight at you to catch up in a reasonable time. I think the reason why he is so strong in pub matches is because of his nature (stealth + melee) which is good against players who don't communicate. He might be overtuned for pubs, but remember that the internal testers are propably a lot better than the average pub player, so he was propably underperforming during testing.  From a design perspective, I would make him weaker, because he doesn't offer anything too interresting to the competitive side anyway, but he is definitely frustrating to face for newer players. That or give him a strong team oriented mechanic to compensate for a overall melee/cloak nerf."

Dirtybomb,3dxl3i,8FlatBeat8,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:41:43 2015 UTC,"That ones broken too :p At the moment I run the one with quick slash,drilled,spares,and the KEK-10.Once the lock on feature gets fixed that will be the obvious go to but in the meantime the extra magazine and reload time is pretty powerful on the kek."
Dirtybomb,3dxl3i,Logios,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:09:48 2015 UTC,I believe the one with lock-on is still the best because it has focus (VERY important right now) and spares.  But really any card with Kek should be fine for Bushwacker right now.
Dirtybomb,3dxl3i,8FlatBeat8,2,Mon Jul 20 12:41:57 2015 UTC,"I hear ya,I very rarely aim down sights so I don't bother with that card but maybe I should give it go,the aim punch is pretty noticeable atm."

Sparks small med packs are really ""tiny"" you have to walk right thru the middle of them to pick them up.  2: Just reverse the colors. Med packs have some blue accents (red for enemy team?) and the rest is like beige or grey. Reverse that so the medpacks REALLY stand out as bright red with only details of the pack being the beige or whatever.   I don't know how to describe it but RIGHT NOW the small portion of the medpack ""lining"" is a color and the rest of it just blends in with the worlds."

Dirtybomb,3dvu94,Killerx09,25,Mon Jul 20 06:07:38 2015 UTC,"as an avid medic player, I've really felt the rise in difficulty of playing one. allow me to share my personal opinions on why there are less medics.  1) phantoms - tank as hell, one shots you with beyblade katana and usually finishes off his target before you can even rez (unless you precharge as sparks). smart phantoms will just whip out the kek 10 to kill you even faster.  2) change to how revives work means that as a medic, you have to overextend further to get your team mate back up. but this is not even guaranteed as he might die/get gibbed during the entire process. Hence, revives seem to function better when you're not under enemy fire."
Dirtybomb,3dvu94,K-oh-K,3,Mon Jul 20 02:06:49 2015 UTC,"And this is why I bought Sparks.   When I see a phantom, I basically go ""Fuck that shit, I'll let someone else deal with that."""

Dirtybomb,3dvu94,Rexatyr,19,Sun Jul 19 23:42:07 2015 UTC,Even with Sawbonez...if you are at the top of the team leader board your team can be losing hard. You have to switch to Fragger and do something about it. Then the calls start for medic from chumps who didn't even bring a medic card.
Dirtybomb,3dvu94,SgtTittyfist,5,Mon Jul 20 00:09:36 2015 UTC,"Hell, if you're topping the scoreboard as medic your team probably is losing hard.  The reason I pretty much stopped playing medic is because there is always that one entrance nobody covers. So I get to deal with it solo. And if I have to solo hold an entrance against what often are 3+ enemies I'd rather have an M4 than a crotzni, thank you very much. That and if people were as good at dodging bullets as medpacks they wouldn't need a medic in the first place.  (I still have a medic in my squad 100% of the time though. Every once in a while, teams actually understand that a single medic can only do so many things at once and help you out)"
Dirtybomb,3dvu94,Aaronerous,2,Mon Jul 20 08:32:48 2015 UTC,"I play Sawbonez almost exclusively and constantly end up in the top three slots in the entire game. Not only do I get a ton of points for revives and heals, but I also constantly have the ability to trade kills if my healing target (let's say a Fragger) goes down and I need to clean up before reviving. I have gotten multiple triple or even quad spraydowns with the Crotzni, just because a Fragger sacrificed himself to toss a frag into the entire enemy team.  I find that medics very commonly get absolutely ridicolous EXP and score in games, which makes them MVP quite frequently. In the end that's a good thing though, sick and tired of games where medics are essentially punching bags for all enemies."

My team sometimes just aren't worth revining/healing, they don't PTFO and don't kill enough people to make it easier for their team mates that are PTFO. It's often more valuable to your team to take a Fire Support or Assault character and break the enemies defence, or take an Engy and try to do the objective instead of reviving players that are just going to die repeatedly without accomplishing anything."

Even though Vassilli was already a questionable addition, working against the spirit of the game, it was at least bearable.

Dirtybomb,3dvu94,FaerinDahol,7,Mon Jul 20 03:07:45 2015 UTC,"Aura is free, but she is a difficult medic for new players to understand how to play well. Most people are used to games like Battlefield where health was easily and quickly distributed. With Aura, you have a station that is has a long cooldown unless you pick it back up. It can also be easily destroyed. Optimal positions for the healing station require at least some basic map knowledge, as well as learning to pick up the station whenever on the move.  Its not easy for people to realize in such a fast paced shooter that staying behind the lines and rezing people is actually a better use of their time than running and gunning."

Dirtybomb,3dvu94,douillee,2,Mon Jul 20 03:24:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but these are the same people that are now joining games without any medics in their squad. Sadly, this is a significant portion of the playerbase."
Dirtybomb,3dvu94,Sessions7,11,Mon Jul 20 04:08:51 2015 UTC,"The last update killed the medics.  3rd person view + animation lock when revived means that the guy you res'd is gonna die before being able to look in the direction of the opponent If he dies he can't help you so you die too as a medic  And now with the possibility to gib during the revive animation it's even worse... you go for revives that wont happen, and die.  Last medics being played only do it to heal themselves. Nowadays i play more fragger / nader / vasili because they impact the game more (and also are good phantom counters)  Nerfing revive like they did makes the game look even more like COD. Well actually with all the mercs planned it will be a (bad) mix between chivalry, cod, LoL, csgo and TF2."
Dirtybomb,3dvu94,QuixoticMcGee,5,Mon Jul 20 01:44:04 2015 UTC,"Actually it needed a nerf, the invulnerability time after a rez was way too high."
Dirtybomb,3dvu94,douillee,4,Mon Jul 20 03:24:24 2015 UTC,"I agree. I mainly play Medic and even I was annoyed that you were basically wasting bullets during the revive animation. The change encourages the Medic to clear the room a bit before reviving which is good practice and is less frustrating to play against.   I never felt particularly clever running into a big firefight, just ignoring the bullets, and running straight for the revives."
Dirtybomb,3dvu94,Bowmayne,3,Mon Jul 20 07:45:24 2015 UTC,"I have no problem with the lower invulnerability time. But why lock the view in 3rd person ?  To me it should be:  either you're in 3rd person and unable to move + long invulnerability or you're in 1st person and can move but vulnerable  But that's AFTER the revive. Now you can be gibbed DURING the revive before the invulnerability. That's even worse because you can just bait the medic, gib during revive, then kill the medic.  And on the contrary, what they did to make gibbing faster (ie allowing to begin gibbing before the end of the death animation) IS a good change. That AND the current lower invulnerability time would have been the perfect balance: harder to make revive trains, revives still possible and useful."
Dirtybomb,3dvu94,Terr_,12,Mon Jul 20 10:49:39 2015 UTC,"Phantom has scared them all off, hell even I find it annoying at best to play her now. Used to play aura exclusively but now it just sucks if there's 1 phantom in the server."
Dirtybomb,3dvu94,CaptainShaky,19,Mon Jul 20 02:52:15 2015 UTC,"Is it the Phantom blues? Feeling too squishy with the current options?    That, and your teammates are often either unscathed or un-revivably dead, so there's less to do on the battlefield. Sort of like dealing with Vassili-heavy rotations, except the enemy doesn't need to aim as well to finish people off.  P.S.: Don't get me wrong, I feel that--property used--Phantom should be able to take a target from 100% to un-revivable, it's just that it's a little too easy for them to do it through kamikaze face-rushing right now."
Dirtybomb,3dvu94,Terr_,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:15:28 2015 UTC,"They don't insta-gib, they just instantly gib once they killed because they're already on top of their victim with their melee weapon in their hands."
Dirtybomb,3dvu94,Starwind87,0,Mon Jul 20 05:13:10 2015 UTC,"I generally think only headshots should be able to potentially gib a player   Like Vassili? But that's just the thing: Phantom has the same job! Both are ""covert-ops"" mercs and both have abilities for focused elimination of high-value targets, but they specialize in different tactical situations. (You can't snipe around corners.)  If someone is actually spending the time and skill to sneak past enemies and stab an unwary target in the back-row, it just makes sense for that target to stay down rather than get instantly revived by a Sparks-sniper or a medic already jogging in from the spawn.  If Phantom is not going to be able to finish-off his backstabbed targets, then we might as well give up, remove the cloak entirely, and just declare him a front-line melee soldier-type instead. Myself, I would rather decrease his front-line abilities, in favor of sneaking, stabbing, and finishing."
Dirtybomb,3dvu94,Xionix1,9,Mon Jul 20 12:17:19 2015 UTC,"There for a while I was playing Sawbonez almost exclusively, because he was my favorite medic and no one else ever played/plays medic.  As such I found myself being the only medic on the team in every pub game... Where it seems like everyone attempts to actively dodge medpacks - so you can't reliably direct hit them, and they just completely ignore the ones sitting on the ground at their feet.  They also have a habit of playing on one of two extremes: playing like chickenshits so I have to be the one to go in first as a medic - or way over extending so it's extremely risky to try and revive them.  On top of that you have Phantom showing up and the revive changes.   So I just switched to Nader. Same quality weapons, health and movespeed as sawbonez... But a more fun ability to use in pub games, and Martyrdom to give the middle finger to Phantom players."
Dirtybomb,3dvu94,MrBogard,3,Mon Jul 20 15:44:55 2015 UTC,This perfectly describes my experience playing Sawbonez as well. I go Fragger instead of Nader though.
Dirtybomb,3dvu94,Hufnagel,7,Mon Jul 20 03:04:06 2015 UTC,"Kinda drives me a little crazy. Sometimes I want to roll assault or engi, but I feel compelled to run with Bonez in 99% of my games because no one else wants to medic. Thankfully, I love Bonez too and he's a regular badass."
Dirtybomb,3dvu94,herminzerah,5,Mon Jul 20 03:51:31 2015 UTC,"Aura isn't fun by default, despite being a fast character, her health station slows her down. Add the fact that phantom 1 shots her, and anybody killed by phantom is instantly downed and not safe to try and revive... you get the idea.  If they take away phantom's ability to 1 shot lightweight characters, or allow her shotgun to do damage through his invisibility then she will see play again.  With her going down in a single hit to fragger, fletcher's direct hits, and phantom's sword. It's no wonder nobody wants to play as her, add in that nobody is playing medics to pick her up if she does  go down and it's a self feeding cycle of nobody wanting to be medic."
Dirtybomb,3dvu94,wagebot70707,4,Mon Jul 20 00:51:17 2015 UTC,"My favorite merc is Sawbonez, he is basically all I play and my only good load out for him isn't even a good one. Not sure why people don't like playing medics. Sure I am not a super defensive medic so I may not revive as much as a really passive medic but it allows me to be extremely potent on the offensive front because he can deal good damage and keep himself going for awhile. It can often be a big distraction allowing your team elsewhere to work on the objective."
Dirtybomb,3dvu94,RayKNari,5,Mon Jul 20 04:16:31 2015 UTC,"Sawbonez rules. He's about all I play too. Personally, I just don't see teammates in a revivable state very often these days. I spit medkits like fire lyrics though."

Maybe if they had the killing power of other mercs or the ability to not get crushed by phantom people would paly them more.

Dirtybomb,3dvu94,HereticKitsune,6,Sun Jul 19 23:27:02 2015 UTC,"Main reason I don't play Medics too often is because I'm utterly useless in a combat situation as Aura, the only one I have.  Sure, I can throw health kits put up stations (whoops) and defibs, but if ANY enemy comes near me I'm dead. I have very little health, it's hard enough to hit people when I have a stuttering 20-30 FPS with an automatic let alone a shotgun, and every time I play Medic I'm treated like garbage for not using defibs on the guy they clearly didn't finish off to bait me out.  I'd rather just play Fragger. Easier to use the LMG and grenades at my framerate, I can take plenty of hits, and I make squishy classes cry themselves to sleep every time I hit the grenade key.  Once I'm able to upgrade and play properly, I'll likely play more medic classes. I'll be able to dodge and shoot the way you need to in order to be a proper medic in this game. Until then, I'm vomiting frags."

I have trouble aiming at fast classes because if they strafe back and forth, it's like trying to shoot Goku with how they teleport between frames and stutters."
Dirtybomb,3dvu94,NekoiNemo,5,Mon Jul 20 07:51:34 2015 UTC,"Playing rez-monkey isn't fun. This is the same problem as Hawken; team with best tech wins, but nobody wants to do that job because it's a first person shooter."
Dirtybomb,3dvu94,Hyginos,5,Mon Jul 20 14:57:50 2015 UTC,I will happily play the rez game. When I use Sawbonez I never feel like being a medic is a burden. I can shoot AND I can heal/rez people. It's a bonus.

Techs have fallen out of favor rather dramatically now that people have better learned how throw emps and focus the tech.

Dirtybomb,3dvu94,RobertSummers,3,Mon Jul 20 17:50:56 2015 UTC,Most of the day today I've been the only medic on the team (Sparks) and whenever there is one they usually don't play medic.  I'm not too fussed since it just means more support XP for me. But it really would help if we could have at least 2 decent medics to a team.
Dirtybomb,3dvu94,Sekular,2,Mon Jul 20 19:22:38 2015 UTC,I feel this. Last few games I've been forced to play Aura because there's been noone who ever has it in their 3 man squad. That being said I've had to keep using the shotty with her because I find it's the only way you can even vaguely deal with the FUCKING PHANTOMS. Shotgun headshot is the only thing that might save you.
Dirtybomb,3dvu94,Grimmherz,2,Sun Jul 19 23:43:15 2015 UTC,Welcome to almost every team game with medics.  This is why I almost exclusively play with friends.
Dirtybomb,3dvu94,littlestminish,2,Mon Jul 20 00:15:12 2015 UTC,I just bought Sawbonez because of this.
Dirtybomb,3dvu94,littlestminish,2,Mon Jul 20 00:53:32 2015 UTC,"To me it seems like an overwhelming majority of people playing Sparks are trying to be 1337 MLG QuickScopers with her Revive Gun. I rarely see a Sparks being an actual medic.  Also most people are just going to play whichever mercenaries are currently in rotation, which is why you'll see teams of almost nothing but Fletcher recently."
Dirtybomb,3dvu94,InXisten,7,Mon Jul 20 01:28:41 2015 UTC,"Most people focus on revives with Sparks, her med packs are better used for her sustainment, not her team's.

The reason it got annoying is that even when I can spot Phantom (which admittedly 90% of the time, as people seem to suck at trying to sneak up on people), I will normally gib him with my REVIVR to pop his cloak - which is fair enough, but by that time he can either out-run me and stab me before my incredibly weak SMG can deal 120 damage, or he'll just pull out his FAR superior SMG and gun me down...  Not to mention, almost everyone seems to ignore the uncloaked Phantom running towards the only medic on the team. Not like they are important or anything! /s >.>  But anyways... I still play Sparks a lot, as Phantom isn't a huge deal XD He's just irritating at times and makes me switch to my good ol' Fletcher to blow his face off with a sticky bomb. (now THAT is fun...)"

I asked Plif from VGS what he thought about him and we think he's going to be a more offensive medic than a pocket medic like Aura/Sawbonez. I was hoping his AOE heal would be similar to the medic from planetside."
Dirtybomb,3dutgi,iTARIS,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:51:19 2015 UTC,"That is interesting, a PS2 medic that does not sound too useful. The AOE heal only lasts a few seconds."

Dirtybomb,3dutgi,Lewpewpew,0,Sun Jul 19 19:50:24 2015 UTC,But at 10/sec as the video suggests it wont really heal people too much.  if its stronger I could definitely see him being useful though.
Dirtybomb,3dutgi,SgtTittyfist,5,Sun Jul 19 19:57:17 2015 UTC,Well he also says he doesn't know the healing rate for teammates. If it is similar to Sawbonez's effect on teammates it could absolutely turn around group fights.
Dirtybomb,3dutgi,Lewpewpew,3,Sun Jul 19 20:00:07 2015 UTC,"That's a good point, it would be like a mobile Aura station but (hopefully) weaker.  could also lead to people grouping up more on attack which just makes my fragger extremely horny."

Dirtybomb,3dutgi,Lewpewpew,4,Sun Jul 19 19:05:59 2015 UTC,"I have a sneaking suspicion that he will outshine Sawbonez in the team healing role. Sawbonez has (relatively) spammable medpacks that make him great for pocketing Fraggers and Rhinos, but trying to keep three or four people going isn't his strong suit.   Phoenix looks like He could sustain a push without having to keep other medics nearby, freeing Sawbonez up to handle the pocket role. I think he'll be a lot of folk's go to medic for pubs and making coordinated pushes.  At this point I'm certainly expecting to see him played in the comp scene as a replacement for the overly fragile Aura. What will be interesting to see is how he will stack up with Sparks when she is allowed into Dirty Cups. I have seen some fantastic Sparks players revive train entire pushes, no actual healing needed.  That's my take, anyways. I, personally, am super excited for another medic!   Thanks for the awesome Video and commentary, kAndyREW, I really enjoy your content!"

That being said, im pretty sure there is a perk that gives your turret more health.  BW's turret is best used as a distraction/decoy/alarm first and as an actual way to get kills 2nd. The best case scenario is to put your turret in a sneaky spot that you can cover from a different angle. enemies will have to chose to kill you or the turret, but either way they are going to die in the process. in certain spots you can hold your own against groups of 2-3 if the turret placement is good enough. 3 is more luck than anything, but 2 is often doable."

Dirtybomb,3dx0xk,CORUSC4TE,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:27:29 2015 UTC,"I disagree. Her mines triggering on their own (and being stronger than fletcher's) allow for proxy users to focus on other things (like ptfo-ing or combat), effectively making her able to do two things at once.   Bushwacker has this to a certain extent with his turret, but it's too flimsy for that.   Fletcher, however, requires to be mindful of the objective at all times if he's defending. His nades can be used more offensively to make up for it, though. :)"
Dirtybomb,3dx0xk,TheGamblerBR,2,Mon Jul 20 14:42:39 2015 UTC,"Bushwacker has a way stronger SMG and more HP.. he is the way to go when you are playing competitively except when you can use proxys speed to your advantage. Fletchers thingies are not as noticeable and big as the mines and are triggerable whenever you want, given the awareness which is standard in competitive play you can use it way better than mines that are beeping, emiting light and beeing fat.  Fletchers ability is way more offense than defense if u use it to defend an obj you clearly missuse it."
Dirtybomb,3dvv13,adetonian,7,Sun Jul 19 23:30:11 2015 UTC,"What I want to know is, where is my baserace!?"
Dirtybomb,3dvv13,soursaurus,5,Mon Jul 20 00:41:14 2015 UTC,"Dirty Bomb with somewhat larger and more open-ended maps would be great.  Like, the availability of community maps and community servers to host those maps on is one of the bigger questions I have about this game's longevity.  Playing the same maps over and over again gets really stale especially on pubs, and having servers larger than just 8v8 would be great too. Obviously going over 8v8 would never work on any of the current maps because of how small they are, which is why community maps would be great."
Dirtybomb,3dvv13,dejecaal,3,Mon Jul 20 00:45:33 2015 UTC,the strength of snipers would make very open maps really hard to play though. You'd be dead half the time with the instagib :(  edit: nvm you said open ended :D thought you said open area. :D
Dirtybomb,3dvv13,dejecaal,2,Mon Jul 20 00:56:20 2015 UTC,"By open ended I mean, with the current maps my pet peeve is that all the action is generally focused on a quite small area. For most maps the relevant areas are small enough that you can run through them in like less than ten seconds. This works well for competitive, but for public play it's less fun.  I'm sure the devs and many other people are sick of the Enemy Territory comparisons by now, but one aspect of that game that people often forget is the fact that it scaled extremely well. It stayed fun at any size, from 5v5 scrims to 16v16 or even larger publics.  Obviously this depended a lot on the map, which is why community maps are so important. Supply worked extremely well for 5v5, but not too well for 8v8 and above. Larger maps like Fueldump were great fun on publics, not to mention all the crazy community maps like baserace. There were also maps somewhere in between like Goldrush, which worked quite well for both small and larger games.  I believe Dirty Bomb has that same potential, but with the current mapset it's not being realized. I understand it's in development and all that, but for a shooter like this there's a very high potential for pub gameplay and having larger maps and larger servers is very important for that.  Publics are also what keep games like this alive, making a 5v5 competitive mode the main focus of a game like this is wasted potential if you ask me. And I say this as a competitive player.  TLDR: Current maps are almost disappointingly linear, they feel almost like Counter-Strike maps as far as scale and complexity goes, while this game is very unlike Counter-Strike as far as gameplay goes. Like I said, this works extremely well for competitive play, but it makes publics a bit stale.  The current maps represent the Supply and sp_delivery_te type of maps very well, but don't represent the fun public maps like Fueldump, Venice, Baserace and whatnot."
Dirtybomb,3dvv13,soursaurus,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:38:46 2015 UTC,"It has to be said that maps like Fueldump, Venice etc(Warbell, anyone?!) would still not be as good with 8v8. Those massive(in ET terms) maps strived with 12v12 or more(which I doubt is ever going to happen with the performance problems at 8v8 already), though I agree that the current maps feel more aimed at 5v5/6v6 like Supply, as a player who mostly plays competitive I don't mind that but I can understand more casual players wanting something different. Dome is a lot more open though and I feel that map would be a more public play aimed map with 8v8, think that's a good public DB size. The 'openness', amount of objectives and routes on Dome just feel way too much for competitive play. Would be nice to see a 'public' map rotation and a 'competitive' map rotation. The community is going to be split whichever way you bend it (look at CS's 'Active Duty Maps' vs the rest of all the modes and maps) so I think it's fine to have maps aimed at 5v5 and maps aimed at 8v8, which is another reason why community mapping has to be a thing so :P Don't care if it's 'SD selects good submissions', workshop or whatever system, it just has to come at some point and rather sooner than later :D"
Dirtybomb,3dvv13,xFrozenNinja,2,Mon Jul 20 02:28:42 2015 UTC,"I agree. As a longtime fan of ET, the player-made maps are what made that game fun for years after release."

Dirtybomb,3dtvzt,CaptainShaky,21,Sun Jul 19 12:31:05 2015 UTC,"I believe SD should focus on developing proper anti-cheat system, to prevent most obvious hacks from working, while also improving vote kick as a kind of safety net.   Fixing bugs and global vote kick is a must. The biggest problem with vote kick is that humans are just... humans. Not every one is fair, some people may get mad fast after being gibbed several times in a row by really good player. Other problem is that, I believe, big chunk of people are voting blindly, without thinking for themselves. If first 3-4 votes will be for kicking someone, there's high chance every next vote will be for it, too. I think that percentage of votes to make vote pass should be reasonably high, maybe 60-75% to prevent abuse to some degree. (Like one team deciding to kick enemy's best player.)"
Dirtybomb,3dtvzt,Luni_,2,Sun Jul 19 13:49:23 2015 UTC,This is exactly my point. Currently we have nothing but the vote kick and it doesn't work properly. It should be their absolute priority.  It would obviously take way way less development time than what the anti cheat system requires. And the problem is growing while the anti cheat will probably take months to be ready.
Dirtybomb,3dtvzt,Luni_,3,Sun Jul 19 14:09:34 2015 UTC,"Yes, and there's danger that many people will leave the game by that time.  Next step should be developing of some sort report system that works inside the game, not by some kind of website. This way they could even get more information about the game, rather than based on pictures or videos. It would also encourage more people to do it, because I think all that hassle with reporting right now may be really discouraging. They could even try to develop some kind of system that detects if someone is being kicked from game due to cheating and prevents them from joining any matchmaking game until they resolve situation with moderators. There is still a lot place for abuse, but if someone is getting kicked from 8 games in a row, there must be something going on."

Not only that, their anticheat is nonexistant and besides pretty words they've done absolutely NOTHING to solve cheaters problem. Biggest joke is that recently i reported a guy who was ragebotting on pub with a name 'lustgaming.net 4.99$ private hack' he was spamming his website in allchat like every second while aimbotting and had over 100frags every game, they first 'solved' that request and then reopened cuz apparently not enough proof (video + steam profile link along with time of a game and all the required info is apparently not enough). I took 10 minutes of my time to make that report and ban an obvious hacker, and it went nowhere. Will i continue reporting after all the trouble knowing they wont care? fuck no.

You can counter Rhino with Nader, Fletcher, Kira or Skyhammer or Fragger very well, for example. Throw some Nades, eventually pre-cook them or roast that Rhino with an orbital laser :D  Phantom however...  Phantom is cancer on 2 legs. Phantom is low risk, low skill, high reward.

Dirtybomb,3dtvzt,zwjerka,2,Sun Jul 19 19:18:44 2015 UTC,"awesome that SD is putting some effort?  but srsly that should be their main priority, fairness and making a playable game. They dont even have simple antihack protection. Yes fixing vote system would work for kicking and shuffling teams, but they need literally complete overhaul and abuse detection. I have over 250 hours and never ever seen teams accept vote to shuffle teams and it was clearly 1sided spawn rape at some point.   Global votekick is a good idea but in game like this "" omg that guy headshotted me 3 times and he's effing amazing "" lets votekick him . see problem there?.  They just need to invest some money in decent antihack system and it'll be much much better.  My bigger concern is AFK teammates for first few minutes  ( not deploy ). They need to balance and fix that because in first few minutes people can really get objectives done while some kid is alt tabbed and faps to lisa ann. Yesterday I was in game with a kid that was 3 games in a row AFK for first 3-4 minutes from a 15 minute long game and we werent able to kick him because again votekick is broken. I think it should be solved by game itself with autodetect system"
Dirtybomb,3dtvzt,chickachoy,1 point,Sun Jul 19 12:51:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah but you have to be realistic here. An anti cheat is very complicated and time consuming to create, and will never work 100% of the time. If obvious hackers are consistently kicked from matches, they will just uninstall the game.  I aknowledged there was a potential for abuse but I still think leggit players being kicked would be very rare, as you need most of the players to vote yes. And anyway, if you get kicked for being too good it basically means you're stomping noobs."
Dirtybomb,3dtvzt,JuaannyD,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:18:43 2015 UTC,"but you also have to consider that even now people vote against kicking hackers on their team because it gives them most likely easy win.  it should be solved by game itself not players, sometimes hackers have programs/scripts good enough that you don't even notice they're hacking. not only killing someone is an illegal action if you understand me.  Like if you had ability to see all enemies on map ( like snipers heart sensor ). You'd just call person skilled for them knowing routes they'll come  from.. this is just an example  Yes I agree with you that it would kinda solve the issue for a while, but some other sort of exploit/abuse would appear very soon or maybe it's already out there."

Dirtybomb,3dvu9g,spib9,12,Mon Jul 20 18:45:45 2015 UTC,"Honestly. Phantom is stupidly easy to balance. Remove the armor effect(or cut it down to 1/4 effectiveness) and weaken the katana but increase its regular slash speed and slow down the heavy attack while giving it an insta-kill from behind. That whole damage timing with the heavy attack is whack as well.  Reward players for skill, not blindly rushing.   Look at the Spy in TF2. It is weak as shit as a fighter but in the right hands can destroy an enemy defense or offense. It is the most powerful class in the game in the right hands. However it is also the hardest class to master."
Dirtybomb,3dvu9g,tigrn914,7,Mon Jul 20 01:56:28 2015 UTC,"Hell, they don't even need to weaken the katana, just don't give Phantom any katana loadouts with chopper. It's kinda mind boggling how easy that particular issue would be to fix."
Dirtybomb,3dvu9g,TwoThreeSkidoo,3,Mon Jul 20 02:57:12 2015 UTC,that extra shield while cloaking should be remove. it also not belong to this game. except......they will give every merc in this game to have shield too.

Dirtybomb,3dvu9g,TwoThreeSkidoo,5,Mon Jul 20 03:43:21 2015 UTC,judge from increasing of phantoms (at first i found 2 per team is the worst but now ran into 4 per team many times). i don't think they will nerf it soon cause right now the money really flow for them. except you take some random comment that say phantom is not OP for sell because it can unlocked by in-game money...even that mean 24 hrs of game play to do it.
Dirtybomb,3dvu9g,boneknocker,2,Mon Jul 20 03:36:58 2015 UTC,balance change are coming.....sign...honestly i feel like they just fishing us with another bait that called hope. cause in the end we don't know when it come. in another word we don't know when they satisfy with the profit from OP sell before betray those who bought it by nerf that OP down to toilet and........i think you can guess. they will release another OP for sell again and the circle of greed will continue. *however right now beside from OP merc i think we already have too many cheaters that not mess competitive but they even leak into casual as well.
Dirtybomb,3dvu9g,boneknocker,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:55:23 2015 UTC,"hmmm...i mean they only nerf phantom when 1. the sale no longer increase 2. when they badly want to push another merc for sell to the market. and in order to push the new OP merc to have a good sell, they have to make the new one OP over the previous one (phantom). make OP over OP is hard right ?  then another choice is nerf the previous OP down to make the new one stand out (another killing machine who can kill phantom like a chicken) and draw people to buy it. but just like you said if the sale still growing they will not nerf him."
Dirtybomb,3dvu9g,boneknocker,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:57:06 2015 UTC,"I think he needs a bit of a speed nerf. He moves way too fast to reliably hit him, particularly because his katana counts as a knife and doesn't slow him down."

Dirtybomb,3dvu9g,broadcasthenet,4,Mon Jul 20 03:25:19 2015 UTC,How to fix phantom:    Make him visible when he is shot.  Drop HP to 100 Remove shield from cloak or at the very least remove overflow damage nullification.  Add swing up time to right click. Remove kek-10.    And there you go you got a ninja merc that can still one shot your squishy targets without having 190 hp and the best SMG in the game.
Dirtybomb,3dvu9g,TwoThreeSkidoo,3,Mon Jul 20 02:28:49 2015 UTC,"Heh, I actually made almost the same suggestions in a thread a few days ago. I think if they dropped his HP to 100, increased the shield to 90, and made him become visible when shot (but still shielded), it would make him much less OP. The thing is, when people actually see a Phantom, he goes down in milliseconds because the whole team will drop whatever the fuck they're doing an focus fire on that douchebag.  Also, they need to remove the long jump + strong attack combo, even the fastest mercs can't back pedal away from that, and if you turn around to run the Phantom can just shoot you in the back."
Dirtybomb,3dvu9g,boneknocker,2,Mon Jul 20 02:55:34 2015 UTC,"that long jump come from his light class speed that make him can do a long leap and when it merge with extra shield and over size hit box of katana that not just bigger than it model, if you watch carefully its hit box can stay there not disappear after the animation end. it more like getting a bulldozer jump on your face. no way to counter."

Dirtybomb,3dvu9g,boneknocker,6,Tue Jul 21 07:14:55 2015 UTC,"Accurately lists all of the major issues with the Merc:   Stealth + Shield + Low Cooldown Katana being far too easy and rewarding to use (+ chopper) Is one of the better gunmen in the game   Ends video with: ""but overall I don't think he's so bad""  Phantom main detected...     Anyone of any skill can recognize that Phantom is grossly overpowered. Sure players are learning to adapt, but that doesn't mean he's balanced at all. Phantom upsets the entire meta and causes players who use him to focus on an entirely different playstyle as compared to every other merc.   The problem here is that far too many players have fallen for the cash grab I believe SD has tried to pull here with Phantom (release OP merc with promises of balance but wait weeks to implement the changes; roll in the cash as players give up and pay cash to unlock the OP merc). With so many players having spent money on him now, it seems like the attitude is shifting a little as the growing number of players who unlocked him work to protect their investment in the game, where before they would have been in favor of some heavy handed nerfs (as Phantom deserves)."
Dirtybomb,3dvu9g,TwoThreeSkidoo,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:36:08 2015 UTC,"I bought him with RL money. He's boring as fuck to play, and needs to be changed because he ruins the gameplay. The most entertainment I get from DB now is playing Vaseline with the PDP. I drop HBD sensors non-stop to ruin the fun for the Phantom players, and then enjoy seeing if I can successfully use the PDP like a shotgun at close range when the Phantoms inevitably focus on me because I'm ruining their party."

I wasn't referring to the issues I had mentioned in the video, but I think we can all agree that some immediate changes need to be made to Phantom. Completely agree with everything you've said there however. That's a very interesting way at looking at how his addition has affected the meta game."
Dirtybomb,3dvu9g,wrench_nz,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:32:56 2015 UTC,"3:40 you say: ""In my personal opinion, it's not that Phantom isn't overpowered at all, it's the fact that the kamikaze strategy is far too rewarding for players to want to learn a better way to contribute to their team while still playing as this merc.""  So, he's not OP at all, you just think the Katana play should be weakened. That's pretty much what you're suggesting here after you list his absurdly broken advantages. My guess is that you want Phantom pretty much exactly as he is except for the rewarding Katana play. This is not a good suggestion, because while the Katana play is stupidly OP and annoying as hell, I'd be especially scared for balance if people actually started using his Kek... In his current state, he'd be even worse to deal with."
Dirtybomb,3dvu9g,GrassWaterDirtHorse,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:09:47 2015 UTC,"No, what I meant when I said that, was that players are having too much fun abusing the effectiveness of the katana coupled with their refractive armour to want to change up there play style and contribute to their team whilst still playing as Phantom (which I gave examples of in the video) I personally enjoy playing Phantom as an objective based merc but most players just spawn in, run into battle and attempt to massacre as many players as possible, then they get killed and proceed to rinse and repeat the same strategy.  he's certainly over equipped for his role, as when it comes to gun play he has an even chance of winning the gun fight because he can't use his shield whilst cloaking, but being able to activate his cloak and charge straight at his foe is much more rewarding because of the melee and finish bonuses. The same goes if you were to charge at someone with a shot gun and bounce around like a mad man until you get close enough to blast one of the lower HP mercs. The same strategy works, its just the fact that wielding a katana is much more enjoyable but it takes away from the core team centric gameplay that Dirty Bomb claims to be focused on. My apologies if that's the way it came across but you make a good point. If players felt more obliged to use their kek I feel like phantom would be worse off! What scares me is that they plan on adding the katana to other mercs not just Phantom. We'll see what changes are made in the next update though."

Dirtybomb,3dtv4x,wwilly,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:42:56 2015 UTC,"The answer is what the game itself considers the ""win condition"" for stopwatch. In a scrim you would have indeed already lost according to the rules...  The game itself, however, could very well still be won due to how it tallies objectives.   For example - a stopwatch game I played on Underground yesterday. My team went on offense first, and we took a loooong time to get the first objective, but we rolled on pretty quickly to the second bomb site with not much time left.  At the end of our round we ran out of time, but we had C4 active on the objective when the timer ticked down. When the other team took their turn at offense they got the first objective down much more quickly than we did - and since we didn't complete the second objective they should have won, right?  Nope. We managed to hold them off entirely on the second objective, and defused their C4 at the very last seconds of the round... So technically speaking, and how the game saw it, we won... Because when time ran out for us, we had C4 actively ticking down on the objective - while when time ran out for them they didn't.  So even though they beat us on time for the first objective, and we both ran out of time on the second objective, the game considered it that my team had gotten further by ""partially"" completing the last objective."

It's only good when you can set up a cross fire, or put it in some unexpected location, but even then it dies fast if left unsupervised. If you like camping playstyle, this merc might be up your valley. But I think that most people play Bush because of Kek SMG, and a sentry is just a bonus. Correct me if I'm wrong.  On the other hand if you like action, speed, freedom of movement, flanking, setting up traps, filling enemy faces with lead - go with Proxy."

Set it up so when people enter the defended area, both you and your turret will hit the target from each side. It deals decent HP and distracts the enemy. Use it as a sentry. Place it somewhere you need guarded and pay attention to either ""Lock-On"" or when it's firing. You'll know people are where the turret is. Distraction.

If your aim isnt the best I would probably recommend bushwacker though,IMO he's easier to use well and his turrets can be pretty powerful when placed properly.Try him out next rotation and see for yourself,it's the only way to tell really.  I wouldn't recommend going for phantom,it depends on what your intention is with DB but playing engineer is far more rewarding to me.All the back stabs in the world don't mean shit if the objective isn't being completed."

Dirtybomb,3dx02o,bathrobehero,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:20:04 2015 UTC,Likely because you have vsync or a framerate cap or that your CPU is bottlenecking the card.
Dirtybomb,3dx02o,bathrobehero,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:40:30 2015 UTC,"Vsync isn't on and CPU shouldnt bottleneck.  The FPS drops are very random, sometimes I get a stable 140-150 FPS and other times it goes from 140 to 50 which is horrible on a 144hz monitor"
Dirtybomb,3dx02o,Ballmeat,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:30:03 2015 UTC,"I have a similar setup and I'd recommend disabling texture streaming. What it does it shoves everything into the memory which you have plenty of instead of constantly reading/deleting stuff to and from memory in order to use less memory.  I don't have any framerate spikes that way. As far your original issue, I'm fairly certain my 3570k is bottlenecking my 780 Ti - without vsync at least - and I haven't checked my gpu utilization so can't help you there."

Dirtybomb,3dx02o,theCamou,0,Mon Jul 20 23:16:02 2015 UTC,"Because that's at the most what the game can utilize, based on your settings which I'm betting on is high(max). As great as the game looks, its no Crysis 3, Battlefield 4, or StarCitizen. GPU utilization(both load and VRAM) is directly proportional to the graphical fidelity(textures, high-poly counts, raytracing, etc) of a game in general."
Dirtybomb,3dx02o,typodaemon,-1,Mon Jul 20 07:22:12 2015 UTC,"I'm a little confused as to why you'd want Dirty Bomb to use more of your GPU. Better graphics or a better framerate are normal goals... just using more power is a strange goal.  But you can do it. I'm going to assume you've cranked up all of the settings in Dirty Bomb and you're running at the max resolution your monitor supports. So, pop open the NVidia control panel and under 3D Settings go to Manage 3D Settings. You should find an option for DSR (Dynamic Super Resolution). That's probably the quickest way to increase the GPU usage. Enable all of the DSR modes and then in Dirty Bomb set your resolution to the highest DSR mode available.   Nvidia's guide to turning on DSR  Also, if you disable v-sync or any kind of frame limiter you should be able to use more of your GPU (because you'll be rendering a bunch of unused frames)."

There are instances when you kill someone and that someone also kills you with bullets which also suggest there's a considerably pretty big delay between actions registering on the server because in this game bullets are hitting instantly.

Dirtybomb,3dvl9g,bortzbot,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:29:55 2015 UTC,So I did the math and each case is $0.20  Phantom= 50000 coins= $9.99  *50000/999= 50 (999= $9.99 worth of pennies)  *50=1 (50 coins= $0.01)  *1000/50 = 20 (1000 coins/50 coins = $0.20)  *$0.20 ($0.20 per case)  So if they did they would be fairly cheap and would crate some great fun but also some problems. With that they should also create a marketplace where you can sell the loadouts you get. I agree I think that it could work but there would need to be some regulation

Dirtybomb,3dsri9,Wilcolt,2,Sun Jul 19 04:55:27 2015 UTC,I'm kinda new to DB since I just started with the open beta so who is pheonix and what did he do?
Dirtybomb,3dsri9,Fire42uck,3,Sun Jul 19 05:37:42 2015 UTC,He's a medic that can self revive when he dies.
Dirtybomb,3dsri9,001_Bulbasaur,2,Sun Jul 19 06:13:44 2015 UTC,Sounds OP I assume that's why he's not currently in game. Hopefully they tweak it and bring it back
Dirtybomb,3dsri9,TitanApoapsis,5,Sun Jul 19 06:16:54 2015 UTC,"Quite the contrary, when people played him, almost everyone said it was underpowered because  it took so long to revive, almost 5 seconds. And whenever someone saw a Phoenix, they just finished him off when he was down because everyone knew about his ability. His self revive was also on a very long cooldown so you couldn't use it every time you died."
Dirtybomb,3durxz,CannotFire,8,Sun Jul 19 17:58:35 2015 UTC,Do not worry they won't drop soon and in the event of a sale I presume only the really money prices will decrease.
Dirtybomb,3durxz,Duranous,8,Sun Jul 19 19:20:46 2015 UTC,I doubt prices would drop. People who have already bought the mercs full price would complain unless they got their credits back.
Dirtybomb,3durxz,thesurvivor2299,7,Sun Jul 19 18:17:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the 30k mercs are only cheaper because they were all released at the start - all the mercs added since have been 50k"
Dirtybomb,3durxz,Hutchythesmall,4,Sun Jul 19 18:18:15 2015 UTC,"Nope, Fragger was a merc released from the start and was priced at 50k, I guess that explains why they're basically releasing him for free left right and center."
Dirtybomb,3durxz,Mellowsnake,6,Sun Jul 19 19:00:15 2015 UTC,"If the price lowered then you payed to have it sooner at the higher price. Not much to spend credits on anyway, unless you want to dump into the endless upgrade to cobalt thing. I think of the upgrade system as more of a credit dump to burn credits on.  If they are pumping out more mercs then I would think they might lower the price of some mercs eventually to make collecting them easier for newcomers."
Dirtybomb,3durxz,Tytaine,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:04:05 2015 UTC,"Just traded up for my first cobalt today (I've gotten two randomly,  for mercs I almost never/will never play)...totally not worth it.

Dirtybomb,3durxz,TwoThreeSkidoo,3,Mon Jul 20 03:41:22 2015 UTC,"Nah, they do this in league too. Most people just look at it from the side of ""It's been out for a long time, you got your credits worth by now"".  I think SD could do quite well with this system, every new 50k merc that comes out, the oldest 50k merc is dropped to 30k. Keeps newcomers from seeing everything at 50k and going away while giving longtime players cheaper mercs."

Dirtybomb,3durxz,Dark-Neuron,3,Sun Jul 19 21:58:50 2015 UTC,you can earn 50k in a week easy by just playing the game and doing 3 mission rotations per day
Dirtybomb,3durxz,canzpl,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:57:52 2015 UTC,"3 mission rotations per day? As in... playing over a span of ~9 hours per day? That's a full time job at that point, not sure what your idea of ""easy"" is..."
Dirtybomb,3durxz,SkttLes,2,Mon Jul 20 05:04:13 2015 UTC,you dont play 9 hours per day. you play around 3 hours. you play your first 3 missions. that should take you 30min-1hour. then you come back 3 hours later for next 3 missions. same deal. 30min-1h. 3 hours later you come back for the third rotation. min maxing
Dirtybomb,3durxz,canzpl,1 point,Mon Jul 20 10:50:41 2015 UTC,"The time between mission's refilling is real time, not in-game time. So when it says you have 1.5 hours until another mission you don't need to be playing that whole time."

Dirtybomb,3durxz,jinoxide,1 point,Mon Jul 20 10:38:22 2015 UTC,"They're used to other rotation games where characters go down in price over time as new ones are released. I don't think Dirty bomb is going to feature a cast of dozens of mercs any time soon, so I don't think they're going to need to do severe price drops, but I do believe that after a few more mercs they should consider dropping prices by 10k here and there on older mercs to allow new players a way to catch up."
Dirtybomb,3dwb95,KinglyCallan,2,Mon Jul 20 01:54:42 2015 UTC,"Apparently they're going to completely overhaul the ranked system by the end of Open Beta.

Dirtybomb,3dwb95,herbart,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:07:03 2015 UTC,"I think if they add cosmetics and skins independent of the loadout system - which they probably will, because the current system means you have to choose between a good loadout or bling - they should have special skins for having a certain competitive rank."

In that game, there's a sound for cloaking and decloaking, but you can't stab out of cloak, you have to decloak before hand."
Dirtybomb,3dumgj,Kazzei,-4,Sun Jul 19 17:57:47 2015 UTC,Having to decloak before being able to do anything wouldn't work at all here.
Dirtybomb,3dumgj,Schoolgirls_,7,Sun Jul 19 18:27:20 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't be so sure of that, it might solidify Phantom more as a stealth class."
Dirtybomb,3dumgj,Kazzei,-3,Sun Jul 19 18:28:03 2015 UTC,It just adds an unnecessary wait while the decloak happens before you can kill someone. That just makes him an easier kill as he's locked in for a second or so before any action can be taken. They could leave him as is and add damage bleed through to fix peoples biggest complaint.
Dirtybomb,3dumgj,Schoolgirls_,3,Sun Jul 19 19:13:00 2015 UTC,"So the initial complaint is that he gets easy kills, and then your counter is ""no, this will make him easier to kill"".   You're not so hot on the debate trail, I gather."
Dirtybomb,3dumgj,Prinsn,-3,Sun Jul 19 19:20:07 2015 UTC,Wasn't addressing him getting easy kills. I was addressing the idea of making his cloak function like that of the Spy in TF2.
Dirtybomb,3dumgj,Schoolgirls_,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:26:01 2015 UTC,"Was scrimming with my team the other day, and the other team was running one Phantom (since he's not banned in the League). The other teams rotations were on point, everywhere we went, they rotated accordingly. Normally, when teams have extremely good rotations, they have someone on their team push up to get information. But we didn't see anyone spotting us.  They used Phantom's invisibility to get the information without us knowing. He would then position himself behind us, and when the rest of his team engaged us from the front, he would pinch from the back."
Dirtybomb,3dumgj,LoNeZiLLa,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:19:41 2015 UTC,"This is just a flaw of being in beta. Phantom was only released a little while ago and the Devs have probably heard the complaints and are trying to fix them. The game most certainly has balancing issues an I understand the frustration, however it has only been a few weeks. With a bit more time Phantom will be fixed."
Dirtybomb,3dumgj,MadCombaticus,-5,Sun Jul 19 18:00:30 2015 UTC,"My only real addition to this would be if he did have his health reduced and his shield taken away, I believe he should get one or more of the following buffs to go along with it: A) A movement speed buff (he is slower than half the other mercs). B) A buff to his invisibility (make him harder to see). C) Give him a damage bonus to backstabs (don't really care about this one, but seems nice enough to mention).         I am mostly in support of B being added since even at ~90% visibility (while standing still) that is still too visible for a class that is expected to sneak around with medic level HP. I'm not necessarily advocating for 100% invisibility, but I can currently spot Phantom's from across the map. Without a damage shield, they'd be easy pickings for anyone with a similarly easy time spotting them."
Dirtybomb,3dumgj,SquirmyBurrito,3,Sun Jul 19 18:42:59 2015 UTC,he is already way too easy at the moment - they need to increase his difficulty not make it easier
Dirtybomb,3dumgj,Blu_Duck,-1,Mon Jul 20 02:10:38 2015 UTC,I wasn't advocating for him becoming easier to play. I also don't really see why he needs to be more difficult to play. How do you add difficulty to a merc whose soul purpose is to kill other mercs without making him worse than non-kill mercs?
Dirtybomb,3dumgj,SquirmyBurrito,2,Mon Jul 20 02:12:18 2015 UTC,"needs to be a trade off risk/reward, we can't say he is supposed to be good at killing and just make him OP   taking away his HP boost would definitely make people think about how they play him a bit more"
Dirtybomb,3dumgj,Blu_Duck,-1,Mon Jul 20 03:45:38 2015 UTC,"He isn't OP. A bit overtuned? Sure, but not overpowered. Taking away his damage shield would just make phantom players even more reliant on their Kek/Crotzni than they already are."
Dirtybomb,3dumgj,SquirmyBurrito,2,Mon Jul 20 06:17:05 2015 UTC,"Look I don't what the solution is, but as it is now any avg player can pick up phantom and top the leader board (including me) this is a problem.

Dirtybomb,3dukc8,JGStonedRaider,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:45:08 2015 UTC,"Haha cookies are awesome though :D Things like HLTV would be very much possible, but there would need to be an API of sorts to receive things like player/match statistics. The news writing isn't that big a deal to set up I suppose if you have willing people but tracking stats etc needs an automated system since manually adding k/d's and scores to calculate averages and player history would just be a massive headache."

Dirtybomb,3dukc8,Ballsackologist,-1,Sun Jul 19 19:01:23 2015 UTC,Same thing. The only clean stuff would be lan matches officially hosted (all machines provided by the host). As far as I know there is nothing of that kind. Competitive teams are invested by hackers just like the normal games. Most are just better at hiding it allthough not all of them.
Dirtybomb,3dw0oh,Houghbert,11,Mon Jul 20 00:18:56 2015 UTC,Charge the paddles and it'll revive your teammates with full health.
Dirtybomb,3dw0oh,Ballsackologist,4,Mon Jul 20 00:43:54 2015 UTC,This should be higher. It seems like a LOT of players don't know it.
Dirtybomb,3dw0oh,Xitium,4,Mon Jul 20 01:08:48 2015 UTC,"One of the worst issues for me at least is the matchmaking, currently you are unable to que with your friends and go to a public server so if you want to play on the same team as your friends with VOIP to have a more fun experience in what is meant to be a ""team-based shooter"" you have to go matchmaking.. The issue is this works 20% of the time, 40% of the time the lobby fucks up and you're kicked out and the other 40% of the time you get a spinbotter... the 20% of the time it does work it's a utter complete domination as the other team isn't a stack or the pairing system throws in rank 30's Gold 1's with unranked players.."
Dirtybomb,3dw0oh,twelve40,2,Mon Jul 20 00:48:28 2015 UTC,"Ignoring the Phantom bit, as it's been talked to death and I think everyone's opinion on him is already out there in the wild, I disagree with your balancing assessment.  Sparks is terrible at combat roles unless you're just amazing with her revive gun, but it's a gun that has a lot higher skill requirement than pretty much any other gun in the game. That's how she's balanced, she's great at revives, but her medkits suck (A lot), and even though she gets the Empire-9 (Which can be pretty good), she doesn't have the health to back it up in any 1v1 situation (both mercs at full health.). Even against the other low HP mercs. Aura should be somewhat near her heal station, or with other people, so  either way the odds are really against Sparks there. Looking at Proxy, she has 10 more HP, and the Hochfir does more DPS, so she should do better there as well. Also, as someone else here said, the paddles can revive to full health as well, the only trick the revive gun has going for it is those long range revives.  Now, for Nader, I find Nader rather well balanced, maybe edging towards the lacking side. She has slightly less HP than all the other mercs that are designed for toe-to-toe combat, putting her at a slight disadvantage there, and her grenade launcher is really easy to avoid, she's area denial, so it's by design. Personally, I think Fragger's the better choice for all but the most entrenched of groups, with multiple heal stations and such. You can dodge Nader's grenades, you cannot dodge a good Fragger's grenades, on top of the fact that Fragger gets arguably the best gun in the game (M4), and 150 health."

Dirtybomb,3dsn2m,oiSamu,14,Sun Jul 19 08:33:07 2015 UTC,"I think it was just okay.  Nothing amazing or disappointing.  Needs a lot more work in map design(not just uploading the textures) to make it enjoyable.  There is no decent cover in bomb sites ala CS, and no arrows directing new players ala TF2.  I think a more narrow map than the current one available would probably be a lot more fun.  Something with tight corridors like the rest of the maps.  The current one just screams TF2 and does not fit."
Dirtybomb,3dsn2m,chillforce,12,Sun Jul 19 03:58:41 2015 UTC,"Personally I don't like playing without respawns, but that's just my personal preference. I'm a really aggressive player which means I'll typically die early on even if I pull my weight and take a decent chunk of their team or plant the bomb before hand. Sure, in competitive play the lack of respawns encourages more caution and more methodical play but in pubs it also encourages virtual cowardice. After our team gets stomped I don't like having to watch the lvl2 Skyhammer who was too much of a wimp to go near the enemy team run around for 60 seconds.  If we ignore my bias for a moment, I think its going to be impossible to balance Stopwatch/Obj and Execution with the same characters the no-respawn thing just changes everything too much."

The absolute superiority that DB offers in objective-based gameplay is why I play it, and why I planned to give them money.

Dirtybomb,3dsn2m,fredthebaddie,3,Sun Jul 19 10:36:26 2015 UTC,"Given the myriad of issues and bugs affecting the game at the moment, I have to the question the devs wisdom of bothering to put even a minute of time into another game mode. Especially when we STILL don't have a finished Dome or any other new maps on the horizon.  Furthermore, if SD were set on making an alternate game mode for DB, why the hell would you not go with CTF? Would suit this game much better than some generic CS/CoD SnD knock off."
Dirtybomb,3dsn2m,ron1n_,3,Sun Jul 19 02:02:24 2015 UTC,"Considering how this is the biggest gamemode in CS (the biggest competitive FPS out there), it's understandable why they did it. They are trying to expand the competitive side of the game. CTF does suit this game, and I would love to see it added in the future.  And I agree with you that they should focus more on other issues before trying to make a new gamemode, but i think they are trying to not repeat the same mistakes they did with Brink (where they killed the competitive scene, and with it, the game)."
Dirtybomb,3dsn2m,Patriot_Brother,2,Sun Jul 19 03:44:08 2015 UTC,"I think execution lacks most things, that make CS SnD a fun game mode. CS would be pretty boring, if every player had access to all weapons all the time. Every good multiplayer experience tells a good story. Mobas are basicly mini rpgs. You have a ups and downs, you overcome previous errors and you progress. DB has this in form of moving objects and a ""moving"" level. CSGO has this in form of money managment, pistol rounds, and weapon momentum.  I feel executions lacks all of it. It is just 12/14 (?) rounds of deathmatch, where nothing really matters. The game mode would probably be much better, if you had a unique character setting, but once again an interessting gameplay idea is blocked by medicore monetization."
Dirtybomb,3dsn2m,PapstJL4U,1 point,Sun Jul 19 12:53:39 2015 UTC,"Well, they need to make money, and the current system is good because it makes it easier to balance loadouts, and it also makes it feel less p2w. However, in my opinion there is nothing better than creating your own loadout.  And you are right, going for this game mode wasn't the best idea. I think that they did it to create a more competitive scene (it is a Classic competitive game mode after all). Something like CTF (or a game mode with one objective in the middle that you have to push towards the enemy's base) would have been better.  Edit: Also, to be completely honest, I think that stopwatch would be great for competitive games and tournaments."
Dirtybomb,3dsn2m,Patriot_Brother,2,Sun Jul 19 14:38:20 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, good old CTF sounds a little bit more interessting."
Dirtybomb,3dsn2m,PapstJL4U,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:03:35 2015 UTC,Really bad mode that does not fit this type of game. Will never be popular. Focus your efforts on the modes which were ment for this game instead.

Dirtybomb,3dsn2m,Duranous,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:12:44 2015 UTC,"Reminds me of survival in Urban Terror, (edit: and even moreso Objective in True Combat: Elite). Doesn't work quite as well because some of the merc abilities are too cheesey for a 0 respawn game mode, although the ability to revive people makes it a little more interesting (do you finish that downed enemy? do you help up your teammate? or risk getting shot?)."
Dirtybomb,3dsn2m,TwoThreeSkidoo,1 point,Sun Jul 19 09:34:19 2015 UTC,"I think it's way more fun than the regular mode, right now I'm only playing execution. It's like a faster paced, more casual counter strike with moba like classes and new mechanics, it's really fun and i barely even like counter strike at all"
Dirtybomb,3dsn2m,ApelsinReddit,2,Sun Jul 19 12:39:29 2015 UTC,"Also, I really like the greyboxed prototype map. It's easy on the eyes and everything reads very well I think"
Dirtybomb,3dsn2m,ApelsinReddit,1 point,Sun Jul 19 12:40:27 2015 UTC,"It's a pretty unbalanced game mode. The mercs that shine are those that concentrate on killing the enemy as quick or as lethal as possible. In this case, it would be Vassili, Fragger and Nader. Strategy is near nil because we haven't had a chance to believe that this mode is viable for competitive, therefore the incentive to play the mode in a competitive environment is non-existent.  It is a good mode though, there is no doubt. It's just that Objective and Stopwatch completely outshine the current Execution maps, and that the idea of not being able to respawn is an alien idea for most players."
Dirtybomb,3dsn2m,kirenasura,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:07:16 2015 UTC,"I'm terrible at this game. At least in the other modes, I can play the objectives or play a healer. In Execution, I just die early and end up spending the whole match watching. I'm sure some people will love it. As a scrub, I'll stick to Objective."
Dirtybomb,3dsn2m,mackejn,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:08:45 2015 UTC,its not amazing but i do seem to run into a load of new players for some reason. always ending up with 20-30/1-5 KD's. imo very boring as noone seems to know how to correctly plant and defend a bomb instead of just running out and dying instantly
Dirtybomb,3dsn2m,themilanguy1,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:23:13 2015 UTC,I'm personally not a big fan of round-based gametypes in general. My experience is usually that something like Execution turns into round-based TDM where the objective is an afterthought.
Dirtybomb,3dsn2m,pnellesen,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:27:54 2015 UTC,"It depends on how well designed the game type is. In Counter-Strike, the objective is far from an afterthought. Even if you've managed to narrow it down to a 3v1, the three-player team will say, ""Last one to the left, let's take a right here"" and focus on the objective while avoiding the last player entirely even though they could probably overpower them."
Dirtybomb,3dsn2m,kqr,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:33:48 2015 UTC,i dont mind it but I think certain mercs are like REALLY strong in it. I know phantom is strong all around right now but he's extremely deadly in execution..

Dirtybomb,3dsn2m,elintepic,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:02:42 2015 UTC,"I cant help but think that this isnt a mode for dirtybomb. Its fast-paced and the normal stopwatch matches have enough competetive elements in them. Also,the map is way too big for 5v5 matches imo."

Dirtybomb,3dsn2m,TemplarBean,6,Sun Jul 19 10:35:30 2015 UTC,No way. DB's objective based gameplay is the only reason to play DB. If I wanted to play execution seriously I would play CS:GO which is infinitely better for it.

I REALLY like execution. I don't like how it is NOW, since it is 7v7 and pretty much noone actually knows the map. I think I like it so much because I like CS:GO and have 900-ish hours in it. I really want to see the devs work on it. However I do feel like the devs should be working on more demanding things such as phantom being OP as fuck and reviving being weird."

The bundles however give you 3 mercs + 2 elite cases that are half off what they should be so there's the biggest bang for your buck as of right now.
Dirtybomb,3dttpk,craqqqqqqqqqq,1 point,Sun Jul 19 12:12:13 2015 UTC,about that do you pay less if you already own one of the mercs in the bundle? because i already have the starter pack and all bundles have one starter pack merc on them
Dirtybomb,3dttpk,Duranous,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:02:49 2015 UTC,"Just want to put in perspective that champions in league don't get price reductions until about one and a half years after their release, that game has also been out for nearly 6 years.

Dirtybomb,3drmui,DatHutchTouch,5,Sun Jul 19 02:41:40 2015 UTC,"Yea, it's really strange. The entire argument from most people for not having lobbies for joining pubs with friends is that ""it'll make teams unbalanced"" but I don't see how that's any different than it is now, now its a pain in the ass to play with friends, and pubs have no autobalance on teams anyway so you can sit in spectate and then join the team with higher level players or w.e. it may be and get away with it."
Dirtybomb,3drmui,rollerfiesta,-1,Sun Jul 19 06:09:47 2015 UTC,"I'm not going to call anyone a 'pub stomp wannabe dickhead' - but we should consider the implications of mechanics like this.  Dumping 5-6 Mumble/Vent-enabled friends onto a public server full of randoms playing with each other for the first time does make for a different pub experience than there is now. People do this already - but it's somewhat rare.   Adding in an organized method to join a group vs. pubs obviously will dramatically increase the scale of 'team stacking'.  So, how would people recommend group joins, without destroying the experience for single-joined players?  Also as was pointed out by SD, there are issues with group-joins due to join-in-progress and the slot reservation system.  (ie. one person cant request slots for other people) otherwise attacks (think dos) are possible, etc."
Dirtybomb,3drmui,packtloss,2,Sun Jul 19 17:10:43 2015 UTC,"Agreed. I don't care if I'm not on the same side as my friends, I'd just just like to be in the same game without too much dicking about."

Dirtybomb,3drmui,KStu82,2,Sun Jul 19 16:56:12 2015 UTC,"15 minutes is definitely an exaggeration, or if it's not, then you're not doing it right. I can consistently join the same game with 3 of my friends (4 people counting me) in a couple minutes, and be on the same team within 5.  Regardless, it is annoying, and I made a comment on a post recently describing this topic, but I'll copy/paste it here with a bit of context-specific editing:  In competitive, the game matches people that are all queued at the same time, and you always start a game from the beginning, so it's a lot easier to get groups of 2+ players in the same server on the same team.  In pubs, it's a lot more finicky, even for 2 people. In order for 2 people to join a pub on the same team, they need to join a team with at least 1 less person than their opponents, but at least 2 away from the team maximum.  It gets significantly more rare to find adequate servers as the party size increases. For instance, with a 4 player party, even joining an 8v8 server, one team would need to have at least 3 less players than their opponents, and it would have to be at most 4v7, 5v8 wouldn't allow the 4th player in.  That being said, I think it would work for a party system to send the group into a game on different teams, wherever they fit, but once they get back to a lobby and auto-balance the teams, the party could stay together from that point on...until one of them gets a case and leaves the lobby to open it (which should also be changed, but that's a whole different topic)."

(Granted in retrospect I could have thrown in Fable or something to that effect just to show it can be a non-MMO RPG)  The questionnaires are heavily researched and can't be altered unless I choose to damage the reliability and validity of the test.

Dirtybomb,3drzey,boneknocker,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:51:25 2015 UTC,I think a the hacking stays in comp because it has the added bonus of increasing a rank and people usually hack because they eat ass so they want to think that they are cool with their shiny ranks that they don't deserve.

Play objective in casual.  The turn-around is quick and most decent players stay in the server for rematches.  It's definitely the best way to approach this game.
Dirtybomb,3drzey,d1spatch,3,Sun Jul 19 06:06:57 2015 UTC,"1 in every 3 comp games I've found to be the average in going up against cheaters.

That would force other players to use things like Fragger / Nader / Arty / Kira. Or only three medics per game, maybe one Phantom per team?  Like I said, it would be a hard balancing act, but it could be done, and might produce great results."
Dirtybomb,3dscxw,Fire42uck,5,Sun Jul 19 01:33:55 2015 UTC,"Again, forcing other players to use different mercs would require those players having other mercs to use. Any sort of per-team limitation on mercs is unworkable with the current 3-person squad."
Dirtybomb,3dscxw,fireoftheabyss,5,Sun Jul 19 02:35:19 2015 UTC,The main reason we see so much same-class-spam is because of the global free rotation. Changing the rotation system to be local would fix the problem.
Dirtybomb,3dscxw,littlestminish,2,Sun Jul 19 03:08:10 2015 UTC,"""Local"" or account based rotation is actually a fairly good idea, cool suggestion."
Dirtybomb,3dscxw,Alphadef,1 point,Sun Jul 19 07:05:39 2015 UTC,"I like the reasoning behind why it should be implemented (save for having agency taken away from individual players, that seems decidedly noncompetitive and un-fun) but it can't work with the 3-merc squad. There's a reason league requires you to have 14 or champs to even play comp, because they don't want people having mirror matches, and the bans. League gives you access to literally every single Champ you own, while DB only gives 3, regardless of what you own. That's why it can't work."
Dirtybomb,3dscxw,dejecaal,0,Sun Jul 19 04:24:20 2015 UTC,"Like I said, in a game where you don't have full and total acess to all options at once it's hard to limit them. Say your new to the game and have sky hammer, aura, and a rotation merc you have to fill the slots. You have 2 skyhammers, a sparks, and 2 sawbonez. You are now forced to play that rotation merc that you barely know how to play and may not even enjoy."
Dirtybomb,3dscxw,LLAMATARIANISM,12,Sun Jul 19 02:38:42 2015 UTC,I just wish you could have more than 3 mercs in your squad. Try 5.
Dirtybomb,3dscxw,dejecaal,8,Sun Jul 19 00:48:55 2015 UTC,"You only really need 4 - ammo, medic, objective, assault. Although 5 would be nice so you could bring 2 different assaults, e.g. Fragger and Vassili."
Dirtybomb,3dscxw,littlestminish,8,Sun Jul 19 01:04:34 2015 UTC,"I was thinking Soldier, Medic, Engineer, Field Ops, Covert Ops"
Dirtybomb,3dscxw,croshd,4,Sun Jul 19 01:20:33 2015 UTC,"I like that there is 3. 5 would make it too close to the TF2 style of ""switch to whatever"" game play. You bring a medic, an objective, and a assault/support/recon merc. Now, do you want to sacrifice your objective or medic so you can bring both fragger and Vassili? I like this. It makes people actually think about it. Its not about convenience, its about strategy."
Dirtybomb,3dscxw,dejecaal,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:28:25 2015 UTC,It's unfun. I can understand forcing almost no customization because of the business model but this is just unnecessary inconvenience.  How many times have i picked a medic/objective/assault only to spend the majority of the game running around with a pistol/knife because no one drops ammo.
Dirtybomb,3dscxw,littlestminish,1 point,Sun Jul 19 12:43:23 2015 UTC,"""Switch to whatever"" is exactly what I want. Being restricted to 3 choices is just pointless. It doesn't suit FPS games and adds nothing to the game. It feels like a really forced attempt to add some depth to the game."

Dirtybomb,3dscxw,littlestminish,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:32:08 2015 UTC,"Your 'thinking' ends when it turns out that your team doesn't have the merc that is needed. Let's assume you take med/eng/support but you can't break enemies' defense. You would need an assault merc but none of your teammates has him either. Or you see that the opposite team takes phantoms. Your teammate picks up Vassili to counter their cloaks. However, your teammate gets dc or leaves and your team is left without natural counter to Phantom etc. Allowing us to have 4 or 5 mercs gives the opportunity to fill out that hole in our squad with the necessary merc."
Dirtybomb,3dscxw,KStu82,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:57:37 2015 UTC,"We shouldn't need 1 merc to counter 1 other merc. That is the problem with having a Phantom beats Medic, Vassili beats Phantom, Vassili beats Vassili rock paper scissors system. That is the problem with the way in which we unlock mercs in this game. We shouldn't have to all have 1 merc just to deal with another merc, that's not a very FPS thing to do, IMO. That's why I think the introduction of a merc that needs a hard-counter is a mistake to begin with. Phantom needs a niche of course, but that niche needs to be smaller than ""I kill what I want and you only kill me if I'm stupid or you're lucky."" As it stands, that merc needs to be either caught out of position or you need to be MUCH better in skill than the one playing him.  I was speaking in terms of ""a perfect world"" kind of example. 4 or 5 (5 really, there are 5 roles. Medic, Support, Assault, Recon, Objective) slots would be a good compromise, given SD has put this game changing merc in the game. I just don't like that we need it. We shouldn't need a Vas on every team because someone wanted to W+M1. Its stupid, and SD should be lambasted for it until they fix it."

Dirtybomb,3dscxw,lurkingbunny,5,Sun Jul 19 01:48:55 2015 UTC,"Disclaimer: I am not defending SD and the fact they have some pretty shitty bugs that make the game less fun, and they released phantom.   I think a few people are worried about SD not working on priorities in the right order. That's a valid concern, but I think its likely that the person (s) that designs and textures maps, the person(s) that does QA bugfixing, and the person(s) that theory-crafts for the game are totally different in scope of duties, so many things may be worked on concurrently, which is fine by me. It seems to me that that's how game development goes.  Here's my subjective opinion on the things I want done in specific order:   1: Fix Phantom. Give him the niche he's obviously destined for, but balance him this time please. 2: Fix invisible walls and glitches on maps. The white room next to the first objective in Terminal absorbs explosive projectiles, and the sniper position next to the large car on the bridge on the last part of Railway. 3: Matchmaking and Early-Game fixes. I shouldn't have to go and rearrange my mercs to make sure I get a specific one when I join a game in progress. That's silly. Plus we need lobbies. That's a big task I know, much bigger than the former request. 4: General optimization. Go under the hood and make this puppy run better."

Dirtybomb,3dscxw,Epic_Wink,3,Sun Jul 19 00:48:13 2015 UTC,"I thoroughly enjoy DB, but only as a casual pubby game. There are plenty of things that need to be fixed and/or reworked, such as the augments on loadouts and the incessant amount of bugs. It really is inexcusable when augments just straight up don't work (potent packs, flying pig, etc). It's a pretty big part of the game and I think that SD should be focusing on ironing out those kinks above all else. Not to mention that the loadout card system just plain doesn't make sense at times - I'm talking about that flinching reduction when scoped on a slow shotgun loadout. It doesn't reward different playstyles for each character, it just punishes people for not being able to roll a card with synergistic augments. DB shows a lot of potential at this point. I'm hoping SD can make this game shine."
Dirtybomb,3dscxw,W1ntus,2,Sun Jul 19 02:00:00 2015 UTC,"I think merc-caps cause more frustration that they solve. If an oversupply of a given merc is too effective, then that's probably a balance issue."

You can spend the credits to get a 6th character of your choice. It's great value and if you end up really liking the game it gives a good head start on collecting all the characters.

Honestly it doesn't take very long to rack up enough to get a merc if you do missions, and on top of that you also have the 2 standard free mercs, as well as a free rotation of 3 characters every 2 weeks.  TL;DR: It's very free."

I got every merc and nearly every top notch loadout card for them and i am at 600 hours. Since you wont be playing every merc but just a certain variety it should take you upto 2 - 3 weeks of casually playing every day to get all you need.   U can hop in every mode once to get a bonus of 500 creditz (50k per merc) that means you can get 2k per day by just playing 3 rounds and winning one of them. You will get an average of 200 credits per game aswel and doing the missions you get every 3 hours should give u another sweet 2k

Dirtybomb,3dreui,Nalrus,7,Sat Jul 18 18:58:47 2015 UTC,"I'd be pretty happy with a Fletcher buff, especially considering how he's pretty good to begin with, despite his lackluster assortment of weapons and, to a degree, perks. It's true that he is probably outshone by Bushwhacker (mostly because of his weapons i.e. the kek; the sentry is also arguably better than his stickies but not by the same magnitude) but I'd say he is as strong as Proxy. He does take a while to get used to.  To be fair, my opinion is based off of pub gameplay only; in a competitive format he could need buffing."
Dirtybomb,3dreui,Zeno_of_Elea,4,Sat Jul 18 20:39:51 2015 UTC,"He is by far the weakest of the bottom tier mercs, as his grenades don't kill anyone when stuck, his trigger time is ridiculous in which fragger has an instant kill grenade with a massive AOE that he can pop during any point in they're lifetime. While it takes 2 of fletcher's grenades, with a massive downtime, oh and his weapon assortment is nothing. I mean, give him the kek and bandaid the issue, since if his ability has to be borderline useless, his primary shouldn't be. Also fletcher has literally nothing on proxy. Pure speed and the Remberg to the face means incredibly hard to take down for even skilled players, that and the mines have a much lower profile and take no player interaction to use. Don't forget Fletcher is bugged to hell with his stickies. It's a 50/50 chance that they won't disappear on hit (and not explode) and it's 100% chance that they will disappear from an entity (not the world, a player) on his death. I'd sent these bug reports in a number of times, and now I'm starting to believe it's not a bug."
Dirtybomb,3dreui,Xist3nce,7,Sat Jul 18 20:57:08 2015 UTC,"I guess that I must not be facing very good players. His stickies most definitely kill aura, sparks, kira, and proxy, and while I agree with you that the det time should probably be shortened (or instant), he can react with his explosives faster than fragger can. The four mercs that he can kill with one sticky are fast, but once you learn the arc of the stickies and get used to pressing 4 to switch to them, I find that it isn't hard to consistently stick or get air-dets on them. And as a last resort he can always stick a player close to him (which is easier because of the distance or lack thereof) and take them down with him (happens all the time to me with phantoms).  I do agree wholly with the annoyances of his stickies disappearing, but I believe it is intended for them to disappear from players when he dies so he can't respawn and get an easy kill.   EDIT: Forgot Kira"
Dirtybomb,3dreui,Zeno_of_Elea,0,Sat Jul 18 21:25:00 2015 UTC,"Playing only 10+ servers when I'm not high as hell, and sometimes when I am, I tend to play mostly Low tier mercs, as getting better at them makes you way better at the mercs that dominate for no reason, most stickies aren't lethal in toss, and after one if you go to toss one more you're already dead. That and the stickies disappearing after being stuck to entities is a bit unfair. Kill a nader while touching her? You're dead no matter what, a Fletcher uses a really well placed grenade from 20 feet, after laying into you with his shotgun, but you end him because his trigger animation is longer than reading Mary Poppin's dictionary. At least give them a tad more AOE, their range is about arms length if it isn't mostly touching them, it does 2 damage. Or even better, have them be shaped charges, stick it to the ceiling? Blast goes further down than to the sides, same with horizontals. That'd at least give him a chance at pulling what any other of the AOE mercs do with every shot/throw."
Dirtybomb,3dreui,Xist3nce,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:37:55 2015 UTC,but I'd say he is as strong as Proxy.   He's definitely stronger than Proxy right now.  I'm not sure why people rank him the lowest considering he sees a lot of play in Dirty Cups while I NEVER see a Proxy.  Proxy's health is just too low to duel and her mines are easily avoided.  Fletcher with a blishlock can definitely hold his own in duels and his bombs are WAY more useful than mines.

Bushwhacker is straight up the best one and nerfing him to be in line with the others would be much better. The KEK-10 is way too good.   This seems a little contradictory. If the Kek-10 is too strong nerf the Kek-10 (or buff the other SMGs), not the characters who have access to it. I think the only reason Bushwacker is the best overall engineer is the Kek-10. The turret is great, don't get me wrong, but if he didn't have the Kek I'd say he was balanced with Proxy."

I think Fletcher is fine right now. He has good offensive and defensive capability with his sticky bombs while the other two mercs are very defensive orientated.

The KEK-10 also has more damage per mag, but only by 15 so they are identical on that front almost.

He has both close range and long range guns to suit his up close playstyle, but when things heat up he can easily backtrack and cover himself with stickies.  Which is why he's my favorite objective merc so far.  The amount of options he has is insane. Unlike Bush, who is a great merc with a good defensive ability but little to no mobility, Fletcher really allows a player to expand their offensive and defensive options."
Dirtybomb,3dqrne,wrightosaur,6,Sat Jul 18 16:38:04 2015 UTC,Indeed. :) Fletcher is definitely my next merc purchase when I get enough credits!

As a public service to you guys seeing this and wanting to try Fletcher:   Pressing '4' will allow you to move around with your bombs equipped. Pressing '5' will allow you to do the same with your detonator equipped.   These two little things will speed up the animation time as you don't need to switch weapons before triggering.

Much much smoother for any ability and let's you do things like walk around and aim properly when quick firing nades or sparks' zapper or whatnot.
Dirtybomb,3dr87t,Duranous,3,Sat Jul 18 18:46:07 2015 UTC,"This has nothing to do with his suggestion.  This deals with the delay you get in throwing an detonating.  The problem is you have to switch to the bomb then the detonator so there is a sort of ""lag"" as weapon switching takes place.  Even if you are using the quick ability key the weapon switching action still takes place."

It practically forces you to play an engineer and if you have another engineer in your team of equal skill level you won't be getting much exp each round.

Dirtybomb,3dpo68,Jawnnn,16,Sat Jul 18 08:00:30 2015 UTC,"The issue with missions like those is that it requires a specific scenario that you could theoretically never run into. Make it a mission to spot 20 players total, and sure."

I'd like to point out that it's probably worth your while to save then until twenty or so minutes before the reset if you can so you can make a call then. If you have a thousand credit waterboy fifty percent done, you might as well keep it because you can't roll a mission any higher afterwards. The only somewhat-completed mission I'd consider getting rid of would be a five hundred credit one."
Dirtybomb,3dpo68,Rexatyr,2,Sat Jul 18 21:04:52 2015 UTC,"IMO a better solution would be to have something like ""play x matches, in each of which you earn at least y (support/combat/game mode) experience"". Would be more in line with the time investment of the other types of missions but still preserve the task of focusing on a specific playstyle.  If they did this, however, numbers would have to be tweaked quite a bit, especially for game mode exp (in all honestly, I'd like them to just get rid of those). In some scenarios you're just not going to get many game mode exp unless you're objective whoring and then it's just a contest of trying to beat the other guys on your team trying to do the same to the objectives... Not that fun in my opinion."
Dirtybomb,3dpo68,p4v07,2,Sat Jul 18 08:39:39 2015 UTC,Amen to that. The most annoying is Support XP. It requires so much grind... when it is active I always hunt people down and throw ammo on cooldown. So instead of focusing my attention to the game and objectives I focus to complete my daily mission. It shouldn't be like that.

Here comes Proxy to beat you by a split second.   The other day I carried an EMP from the EV to the objective with a Sawbonez following me, not only did he refuse to help kill the enemy along the way or drop any healthpacks, he also gladly let an enemy kill me as I was planting before killing said enemy and plant the EMP himself so he could get the xp.  I'd like to see them change the xp for delivering to like 500 and give people that guard you along the way something like 25-50 per tick and another 200-250 while guarding someone that's planting?

If a large reason of why you're playing is to get credits so you can play for more credits (as seems to be the case with OP) then perhaps you should reevaluate whether you really enjoy the game or are just falling for the business model trap they set up.  Sounds much more reasonble to me to have fun with the game, and if that means occasionally getting a credit bonus, then so be it. If it's not fun, then just don't play. It's not going to become more fun once you've reached a certain amount of credits, because by then you'll have figured out a new amount of even more credits you'll want before you start having fun."

Dirtybomb,3dq5qu,CORUSC4TE,31,Sat Jul 18 18:25:43 2015 UTC,Give Arty a tracer dart/arrow rather than a laser pointer.
Dirtybomb,3dq5qu,EvanTheNewbie,14,Sat Jul 18 14:48:28 2015 UTC,"This would be amazing. The biggest problem with arty is that his targeting is so finicky. A physical tracer would solve that and allow for some indoor utility.   Plus, it would be rad as hell to impale people with a tracer arrow."

Dirtybomb,3dq5qu,kydaper1,11,Sat Jul 18 23:54:05 2015 UTC,"Maybe just let them use their abilities indoors, but they don't work as well?  Arty: Artillery hits the roof of the building and drops rubble from the ceiling. It does less damage that actual shells, but rubble falls for a bit longer. (Arty needs a buff in general btw).  Kira: The laser is much weaker because it just cut through a building before reaching you. Visually it looks a lot less impressive and it does a lot less damage. You can probably sprint through it without dying but you don't want to just sit inside it while defusing the C4 for example."
Dirtybomb,3dq5qu,TeaL3af,4,Sat Jul 18 14:10:44 2015 UTC,good idea. the supports main function is to get people out from camping. the bad thing about this would be that the only way to counter arty and other supports is to run for cover. they need something else. would make them too well rounded.
Dirtybomb,3dq5qu,clamo,-1,Sat Jul 18 21:28:57 2015 UTC,"Or maybe the laser can just have a 2 second ""burn through"" time which means that it has to stay in one position for 2 before the laser burns through the building. After that it's size is slightly diminished and you can't move it without having to burn through the building again."
Dirtybomb,3dq5qu,fireoftheabyss,6,Sat Jul 18 17:39:14 2015 UTC,"As someone who pretty much mains Arty, here are my thoughts on him.   His artillery strike is actually quite strong. When you learn to aim it at the right spots (behind the EV when it's being repaired, etc) it's a lot more versatile than Skyhammer's because of its' short cooldown.   However, it has a lot of things that tick me off. -If shot, it resets the counter to launch it. Arty is very hit and run with his strikes (they are, after all, very small and quick to reset), and it's a massive pain to paint the ground when enemies are aware of you. This REALLY needs a change. If anything, Skyhammer should have to paint the ground for longer (especially since his ability is so much more impactful). It literally makes no sense.   -His targetting is very finicky. The aiming is a massive gimmick, and it needs to either be a dart gun type of thing or a LOT better. Thrown would make it very difficult to aim (especially since the area is so small).   -It doesn't work under windows. Both Skyhammer's and Kira's fire support breaks the windows (think the last stage of Terminal, the skyroof above the two containers?). Arty's does not. You literally have to ask a Skyhammer to break the windows before you can call it in.  Lot of bugs with Arty, most of them with the way the targetting works. If it was a simple dart gun (hell, even repurpose Sparks' REVIVR to shoot tracking darts that stick to enemies). Then watch them run into their allies and blow them all up from the sky :)"

It would diversify him from Skyhammer and give him a purpose as a long range merc with a focus on accuracy and area denial.  As it stands everything in Artys kit is great outside of his Artillery which is complete garbage, he is just a worse skyhammer (who mind you is free)."

Problem here is that he then starts to blur roles with Stoker, an unreleased merc who specializes in area denial with his firebombs. I think Arty would be a hell of a lot better if they just made the targeter more reliable, it's just a pain in the ass to try and use in its current form."
Dirtybomb,3dq5qu,The4thSniper,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:46:25 2015 UTC,"I dunno more area denial isn't a bad thing, they could give his artillery say 60%~ of Skyhammers airstrike cooldown. Also to note it would not do nearly as much damage as stokers fire but enough to make staying in it dangerous or trying to run through it deadly.  As it stands the only real form of true area denial we have is skyhammers airstrike and the cooldown on that is massive. It might be best to save the Arty rework until we have stoker to see if more area denial would be a bad thing, but I don't think it would be. Outside of all that simply buffing the current iteration of his artillery and making the designator not complete garbage would go a long way.   Hell even simply doubling the range of the current explosion and making the designator better would be fine as a bandaid fix until later."

Dirtybomb,3dq5qu,Kazzei,2,Sat Jul 18 11:34:38 2015 UTC,"Happens with Arty too, you can aim at the wall next to the broken opening, and the artillery will do splash damage to people inside."
Dirtybomb,3dq5qu,TwoThreeSkidoo,0,Sat Jul 18 17:00:36 2015 UTC,How about gove arty a sort of drone rocket like that killstreak in cod. You control it so you can hit very precisly just like the artiliry strike up the damage and cooldown a bit. Or would that just make it a small skyhammer special but only with high accurcy if you aim correct  and smaller damage radius.

Ghost footsteps and other sound issues Hitboxes, ladders, jumping, planting Awful hitreg Penetration/ Wallbanging Movement   Please tell me the amazing things the Valve Devs did that improved the game to 500k.  The reason why CS:GO has so many players is because of how big CS 1.6 was, the pro scene, and skins.  This is coming from someone the loves playing the game, but realizes how broken it is."
Dirtybomb,3dq09s,skinkbaa,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:25:58 2015 UTC,"You didn't list any specific bugs, just things you don't like. CSGO is much bigger than 1.6, the pro scene is big because of the size of the game not the other way around, and many games have skins."
Dirtybomb,3dq09s,pisshead_,0,Sun Jul 19 06:49:45 2015 UTC,"""CS:GO is broken"". I don't even...  Ghost Footsteps is a rare bug that does not affect many people. I have never had the bug myself, for example.  Hitboxes on the whole are quite consistent, there are well documented (and also very rare) incidences where planting hitboxes have been desync'd, and jumping hitboxes are known to be a little iffy. Thankfully, neither of these little issues are seen frequently, and it rarely makes any difference to gameplay. I have never experienced the plant-hitbox bug for example.   Hitreg is pretty great in CS:GO tbh, even with the official 64 tick servers: and even better in the 128 pug service servers, like ESEA. Recently there has been some rumours of hitreg issues since a recent change, but that is a very recent thing - and will probably be fixed soon. I have not had an issue with hitreg recently personally, however.  What bugs exist for wallbanging?  What bugs exist for movement?  You have failed to list anything which is even close to being as damaging for CS:GO, as having no anti-cheat measures has on DB. GO has its bugs like any game, but they are all minor annoyances at best: the complete lack of anti-cheat for DB is very real."

Planting Reg and Ladder Reg are 2 massive bugs in CSGO and many pro csgo players have made comments to valve to fix which have fallen on deaf ears. The devs for CSGO also didn't really do anything to grow that number you can thank the marketing team for CSGO numbers mildly but mostly other companies making increasingly shittier FPS's i.e: Every cod since 2008 (Not saying CSGO isn't the peak of FPS just saying you can't pin their rapid growth to the devs making a BUG FREE game, or ignore the fact that there isn't any other GOOD fps on the market right now) Again you have mentioned this a few times ""no anti-cheat measures"", they do have anti-cheat it's just crap and as previously stated a new improved and hopefully much better anti-cheat system will come out on release."

But i don't think flaming DB because of lack of a real anti-cheat in beta is a real winner here either, VAC was a joke until about 2 years ago and how long have they had to get it right?

Dirtybomb,3dt4k3,PlZZA_LoL,10,Sun Jul 19 05:02:11 2015 UTC,"The first two are basically the same as the Game Mode XP missions, except instead of everyone on the team getting some progress sprinkled in throughout the game, about 2 or 3 people in each game make any progress on their mission at all.  It would also force you to be on the attackers or the defenders, something no other mission does at the moment. That could be very frustrating, since some games the side you need would be full, and you would literally be wasting that whole game just to have another chance next game after the teams scramble."
Dirtybomb,3dt4k3,KStu82,6,Sun Jul 19 05:30:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the current system is a lot less frustrating than having hyper-specific missions would be.

I'd rather not, partly because if somethings comes up, it doesn't solve the problem, because said person ""rq-ing"" will probably go AFK the entire match or just throw the game. Allow abandoning, but do it like CSGO did. Start with half-hour bans from Comp. Then 2 hour ban. Then 24 hour ban, ect. until we get to full week bans, and if they are that bad, ban them for a month. (Yes, people have been banned for a month in CSGO for abandoning the game to much.)

There is no greater feeling than winning against the odds 4 vs 5.  But as for people leaving mid match the servers seem very temperamental, I have had 4 mm matches cut short since of a ""connection issue"" and if you click the rejoin button it never works and send you back to the start screen..... which is infuriating mid match!

Dirtybomb,3dqej4,Alma2929,1 point,Sat Jul 18 14:56:05 2015 UTC,"All four provided solutions are, to be quite honest, really bad. 1. The rule for most game devs is: not harming the ""innocent"" player outvalues rewarding them. People with a leaver in their team should not have a bad experience just because someone left, that's all there is to it and I doubt it's going to change. 2. It's too subjective to what you would call a bad KDR. Medics can have horrible stats but tons of revives and push the team forward, on the other hand, fraggers can have tons of kills and have little to no impact on the game. Stupid idea and hard to implement to even try pretending it would be fair. 3. That would create a system where the vast majority slowly pushes towards Cobalt/Elite since there's much less ELO (or w/e you call it) decrease for losers than increase for winners. That would only harm matchmaking algorythm (let's pretend there is one :p) by providing bullshit data. Not a good idea in either short or long way. 4. Same things, stats are not relevant to the impact of players on the game. Maybe you could scale it to the total ELO on the other side but that's also a half-solution.  Harsher punishment for leavers and a larger playerbase is what might help, the system on its own is not bad. Oh, and just so people don't forget, Dirty Bomb is in the beta stage, I'm fine critisizing them since the moment they've started earning money from it but believing we're more than their free (or even profitable) beta testers is silly."

Explain how that is ""balanced"""
Dirtybomb,3drgua,infernomage,-10,Sat Jul 18 22:26:05 2015 UTC,My serious answer was: - lower his hp - overwork the stealth for teamplay issues - rework the katana / remove it because the oneshots right now turns everyone on pubs into ninjas right now (is there somewhere written that he NEEDS a katana? Stealth is strong enough) Thats all... the stuff with rhino movementspeed and shit was a joke. Got it?

Dirtybomb,3drgua,SquirmyBurrito,-3,Sat Jul 18 23:48:31 2015 UTC,The stealth mechanics is his image while every q ability (rhino and nader) are their image. Dont write bullshit. Also the stiletto doesnt have a hitrange from germany to africa. Phantom will keep his image with his stealth ability and is still superior to any other class with more hp and the best smgs. Also the game is ment to be balanced for comp play and oneshotting katanas doesnt fit in a comp scene dont you think so?
Dirtybomb,3drgua,shkyy,2,Sun Jul 19 00:27:32 2015 UTC,"The stealth and his katana are both huge parts of his image. He is the entire reason the katana was added into this game. The stiletto may not have the range, but it is faster. He isn't superior to every other class. His HP is only 7 points above the average, and he is far from the only merc with access to the kek and the crotzni. His katana only oneshots the squishy characters, the ones who were oneshotted by the stiletto pre-nerf.

Either they go full 313373 ninja style with m1 spamming their sword or they position themself terrible... if you just listen to the stealth/unstealth sounds and have at least 2 eyes that are watching your screen and youre focused to the game instead of watching 5 other streams with a 10 monitor setup and listening to 999% volume music while playing its not that hard to outplay a low lvl phantom. But when a good player is playing him and actually uses the kek10 instead of going full meleetard its really hard to gun him down. The only thing I hate about him is the katana damage while having the ability to oneshot half of the classes encourages the bad pub players to continue go full melee backstab/frontstab ninja mode. I would be fine if he had like 100hp and a cricket. Also what I would really like to see is an ability to use an AOE cloaking field for yourself and surrounding teammates lasting 5-7 seconds to get some grouped engages on for example EV's stuck at horrible places where you would never get a decent engage otherwise. High Cooldown to balance the skill. I think that would make phantom a good ""teamplayer"" and maybe comp viable. But what have I to say with my 420h gametime, pretty sure most lvl5 players know it better than me like they always do."
Dirtybomb,3drgua,shkyy,0,Sat Jul 18 21:54:25 2015 UTC,"The katana and assassin playstyle are his selling point though, but they are a bit over emphasized.

Dirtybomb,3drgua,Alphadef,0,Sat Jul 18 23:42:37 2015 UTC,Obj hacking? Means hes an engineer then and you can throw any other eng away after that I guess because hes in every fact superior to them.

Yea its safe to say phantom is OP to the point were its almost game breaking.(and he has def removed any of the fun i was having with this game) As this is a free game and he is locked behind a paywall. i have no choice but to say this a total  pay to win move to generate revenue for nexen.   Things that need to be fixed with phantom  1. Remove primary weapons leaving him with a pistol and a Katina.  2. Remove armor component of stealth, phantom should take full damage cloaked or uncloaked  3. Reduce health to 80 or less to fit his role as a stealth merc"
Dirtybomb,3drgua,Soundguy21,3,Sat Jul 18 23:24:09 2015 UTC,"I will preface this by saying that I agree that Phantom is OP.   Yea its safe to say phantom is OP to the point were its almost game breaking.   Not even close to gamebreaking. Fragger is just as good of a killer in most situations, although he should really be much better than Phantom head-on. He can't revive or do objectives quickly, nor can he give ammo. You still need other mercs.    he is locked behind a paywall.   You mean grindwall, not paywall. You don't have to spend money. And I dunno how much you play daily but I'm gonna assume because you're on the subreddit that you aren't the kind of casual who only plays 30 mins a day to mess around. And it does not take that long to grind out 50k for a new merc. You could do it in 15 hours of gameplay if you're lucky with the missions you get.  Your suggested nerfs are a massive overnerf that would leave him useless. Any 2 of those 3 would be fine, but all 3 together create a merc that's only useful for hiding like a pussy and not helping the team. Especially when you consider Red-Eye and Stoker are gonna be great counters to Phantom."
Dirtybomb,3drgua,LLAMATARIANISM,3,Sun Jul 19 01:19:18 2015 UTC,"To be honest, I don't even think he is OP at all (except for execution where he just wrecks because invisibility). He is overturned, but going against a good Phantom player is like going against any other good player. A good Fragger will kill just as much, a good Rinho will hold a corridor all by himself, a good Sparks will revive all it's teammates and even kill people with his laser gun.  Phantom is more annoying because he is easier for ""bad"" players to do well with. And that's why he should receive a nerf. Taking away his shield and either lowering his wepon tier (no Kek-10) or reducing his health (giving him more speed because that's how the game works.)"

Dirtybomb,3dsslc,TheRabidPigeon,3,Sun Jul 19 02:48:48 2015 UTC,"I think you should be invincible during the animation of getting up, and the invincibility should end as soon as it finishes, when you are able to move and shoot and everything. There is nothing more frustrating than getting revived, or reviving someone and getting the XP for it, and then you/they die during the animation of getting up."
Dirtybomb,3dsslc,KStu82,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:55:43 2015 UTC,"I don't think that would work all too well for gameplay though. I'll throw a hypothetical situation at you where this what you suggested could really end up fucking you over:  You are shooting at the bigass angry enemy fragger. you gun him down. You are low on health and just emptied an entire mag into his face. you load a new magazine into your gun and you see a crazy ass Aura fly through the door. You try to shoot her but shes moving crazy fast. She revives the Fragger with about 75 health. You cannot kill the Aura by the time she flies out of the room. She got away. Now you, are stuck in a staring contest with a big burly fragger as he is slowly standing up. you cannot shoot him yet or nothing will happen. He already has his crosshair on your head. He finishes the animation and you unload your puny SMG into his face as he throws higher caliber bullets into your face. You die. GG no re. He walks over to your body and teabags your face. His balls smell bad.   This is really the only reason I don't think that the whole invulnerability thing works too well. Also if you see someone get revived you are GOING to start shooting. And when you shoot someone who you just killed because he just got revived and you aren't doing damage, you have all the right to be pissed off and salty af. I just think that it would be better if the second he is revived you could pump some bullets in his head as he is defenseless in the animation. That way, he stays dead and you can kill the crazy Aura who is reviving teammates in the middle of a fucking firefight. This is the way it should be because if said burly fragger is revived RIGHT in front of an enemy he SHOULD be killed. That's 101% the Aura's fault."
Dirtybomb,3dsslc,KStu82,3,Sun Jul 19 03:29:23 2015 UTC,"In that kind of situation, the current form of invulnerability seems OK. While standing up, you can finish them, but if they successfully revive, they get rewarded for it with 1 second if invincibility.  I don't really care how they do the invulnerability. No invulnerability at all, 1-2 seconds, or how it is now. In any case it's just a game mechanic I can get used to and not get salty about (that may be just me though)."
Dirtybomb,3dsslc,Xionix1,-2,Sun Jul 19 03:37:59 2015 UTC,It's great that you don't get salty about that kind of stuff. All of friends and I all get pretty mad and are pissed off at the current reviving system. That's what drove me (A dyslexic teen) to take the time to make a neatly edited rather long rant on reddit.
Dirtybomb,3dsslc,herbart,3,Sun Jul 19 03:41:28 2015 UTC,"I often play Fragger with the M4 and frequently run in to the situation where I am in a 1v1 battle with someone, manage to kill them and continue holding the trigger to finish them only for them to get revived and become invincible while I am still shooting them as they magically get up and become invincible while my headshots do nothing to them. Then my magazine becomes empty and they simply kill me as I am forced to reload or switch weapons. That is ridiculous and not fun at all.   There should not be any invincibility on revives at all. If you want to revive somebody you should have to remove the threat first. Really pisses me off now that I think about it."
Dirtybomb,3dsslc,Hutchythesmall,4,Sun Jul 19 04:31:13 2015 UTC,Since the update I haven't had this problem at all. You can still shoot their body for about half a second after they get picked up.
Dirtybomb,3dsslc,ComJak,0,Sun Jul 19 04:45:40 2015 UTC,I could not agree with you more. I don't like how invincibility makes reviving a teammate in the middle of a firefight a viable option. Being able to revive a teammate instantly is pretty fucking powerful. It is incredibly stupid when reviving them not only instantly brings them back to life but also makes them an invincible bullet shield. Essentially it rewards people for dying near a medic.
Dirtybomb,3dsslc,azdrubarthegreat,2,Sun Jul 19 04:38:21 2015 UTC,"That was the problem before the update, not after. Now you actually have a decent amount of time to finish people off, even if they get instantly revived."
Dirtybomb,3dsslc,ComJak,3,Sun Jul 19 16:00:55 2015 UTC,"It's fine. Like you said, medics aren't supposed to revive in the middle of fights but the way it was, that's exactly what was happening. They would charge in, revive, and there's nothing you can do about it. Now you at least have a chance to rebut the revive by killing them as they are getting revived."
Dirtybomb,3dsslc,azdrubarthegreat,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:51:54 2015 UTC,Why do you say that medics are not supposed to revive in the middle of the fights ?
Dirtybomb,3dsslc,ComJak,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:58:25 2015 UTC,"Because a good medic will be able to pretty much infinitely revive someone if the ""patient"" were invincible right off the bat. It was the most frustrating thing to see before the patch. I would win a fight but a sparks from outside my fov would just rev him and there was nothing I could do. Now at least I can keep shooting and get the gib before they are standing."
Dirtybomb,3dsslc,azdrubarthegreat,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:03:04 2015 UTC,"Don't act like the medic (aura/sawbones) is not taking huge risks/damage to get the revive done. Sparks is another matter entirely, which the devs tried and failed to adress with this patch changes of the revive mechanics.  I think revives are in this game precisely to get revives done under fire, and the situation you describe is not an accident : it is an intended gameplay mechanics. With a little bit more experience with teambased obj games, and revive orientated gameplays you would know the rev+invincibility is the only way to get through a good crossfire, and that it works perfectly."
Dirtybomb,3dsslc,Cr4zy,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:06:07 2015 UTC,"Not really. Anything around a corner is an easy revive. Just send the meatshield around the corner, shoot, get a kill maybe, die, aura/bones just sits behind the corner and revives. If your teammates aren't complete dunces and out in the open, then revives aren't difficult.  I haven't had any issue pushing with the new mechanics either. It just prevents complete bullshit revives when you've clearly won the fight already.  I do agree with OP that once the revivee shoots or uses an ability, the invincibility should be canceled."
Dirtybomb,3dsslc,mr_banhammer,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:23:16 2015 UTC,"It is so on purpose. It is not more frustrating than other classes abilities, because it is not even a direct one : you need two people and coordination. This should be rewarded.  The shield effect of the revive is the only thing protecting the medic, and the other pushing teammates. It is important to look at this matter not in the sole publicplay way."
Dirtybomb,3dsslc,mark20600,3,Mon Jul 20 14:54:55 2015 UTC,"I really dislike the new change. feels like it was a oh shit sparks revive spam needs a fix,  so they changed the way revive invincibility works so you could stop the 50 sparks revives on a defusing proxy. With no second thought about how it would change gameplay overall with the way other medics play.  it creates really frustrating encounters when you are trying to gib a player who just got revives only for them to become invincible, eat your bullets, force you to reload, and then shoot you back."
Dirtybomb,3dsslc,mark20600,2,Sun Jul 19 07:30:19 2015 UTC,"It's already tweaked enough. You shouldn't be revived in a middle of a fire fight anyways.   Yeah, it could be better but whatever the developers do, everybody just complains."
Dirtybomb,3dsslc,mark20600,2,Sun Jul 19 03:00:29 2015 UTC,"Your poll is not that great, not everyone is one or the other. I think the revive function is fine right now, it gives you a chance to react to the medic reviving but also rewards the medic with a powerful teammate after they survive."
Dirtybomb,3dsslc,mark20600,-2,Sun Jul 19 03:57:08 2015 UTC,Medics are not supposed to revive teammates in the middle of a firefight. That would be insanely OP.
Dirtybomb,3dsslc,mark20600,3,Sun Jul 19 04:35:17 2015 UTC,"Medics always revive in firefights, its not insanely op."
Dirtybomb,3dsslc,Hutchythesmall,0,Sun Jul 19 05:19:00 2015 UTC,"If you die, and then are instantly revived and you become invincible which is incredibly OP. You should not be able to be revived in the middle of a firefight because you just died! this means that you failed. You exposed yourself too much, you were out aimed, you didn't check your flank, whatever! You should be punished for being careless.

He's also my favorite merc, so I might be a little biased, but I wouldn't play him if I thought he was UP or OP.

Proxy - Being able to run into the tunnels and setup mines / sneak kill is always fun and effective.  Sparks - Sightlines.  Underground  Vasili - The sightlines on last are insane.  Fletcher - Stickybombs are amazing given the small hallways.  Aura / Sawbones - The small hallways and areas bode well for the healing station / medipacks. might switch out for Fragger if i have medic friends on the team.  Chapel  Vasili - The sightlines on this whole level are insane.  Sparks - Once again, sightlines break this character on this map. Plus the EV bug exists.  On Defence: Skyhammer - The dude is just really Solid, plus deals well with EV's.  On Offence: Bushwacker - The sentry gun is great for holding off flanks as you get your repairs done.  Terminal  Nader - The spam into the small holding areas is amazing.  Sawbones - Just all round really solid on every point. Maybe Aura is better on Defence.  Bushwacker - Those sentry guns really go to work on this map, so many nooks and crannies to put them in.  Bridge  Kira - This map has so much open skybox for the first 3/4 of the map that using that glorious death laser is really effective + EV damage and ammo helps, since the ammo crates on this map favor attackers.  Sawbones - Some people might like Aura more, but I think that Sawbones' DM is stronger and he has a better health pool to actually take some flak when needed, since this map is so open you are bound to take the stray bullet or two.

I had seen this on twitch.tv/OLBAA stream previously and had shadowplayed some clips of myself using it, but when watching his stream he did a perfect example of making use of it with this.

Dirtybomb,3dpnur,wrench_nz,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:24:37 2015 UTC,I really think that if you're going down a corridor like that with just a gun you'd be engaging the enemy ineffectively anyways. Usually when enemies get clumped up like that you'd lob a grenade and deal with all three. The other thing is something that has been already stated. It's easy to throw grenades over people you see in front of you that you are prepared for.
Dirtybomb,3dpnur,gaulitz,2,Sat Jul 18 21:43:50 2015 UTC,The solution to this is don't throw grenades into team mates.

Dirtybomb,3dpnur,Epic_Wink,1 point,Sat Jul 18 08:42:21 2015 UTC,It's harder than it sounds. When I throw a grenade I always take into account the team mates that are in front of me. But often times team mates will be inside of you just enough to where you can't see them but your grenade will get caught in them when you throw it. Thats basically where the frustration comes from.

Something you could do? You can do a ""Random squad"" thing, everytime you die, you roll a dice and play as the merc it rolled to. Or Competitive MM Vids, although I've heard that doesnt work well (Im a filthy casual and just do pubs) Full-round live comms are really nice, same with tips videos, long streaks where you pubstomp or playing agaisnt competent people and showing the new-ish people to paly the objective. EDIT: You can do another little challenge I  just thought of: Nade Jumping as Fragger! You basicly jump with nades to dumb spots and get ask many kills as you can."

Dirtybomb,3doyvb,Jawnnn,3,Sat Jul 18 01:48:15 2015 UTC,It's mindly terrifying to realize the cost of a cobalt. I never realized that you needed 6 golds to make a cobalt.
Dirtybomb,3doyvb,OperativeLawson,9,Sat Jul 18 04:11:38 2015 UTC,"Right?! $182 is crazy! And there's a large chance you might end up with a weapon you don't even like. I feel like they really need to either allow a downgrade system, a chance to re-roll, or just letting us trade cards.   /r/DirtyBombTrading has a nice ring to it."
Dirtybomb,3doyvb,OperativeLawson,2,Sat Jul 18 07:54:53 2015 UTC,"Only problem with allowing players to trade loadout cards is that it will very easily establish a real money market for cards. It would undermine the value of both normal and elite cases. I believe it would be fine where you could downgrade a Cobalt into two or three gold cards, however."

Dirtybomb,3dmlfk,SquirmyBurrito,2,Fri Jul 17 15:35:22 2015 UTC,He only killed them in one melee hit because they were injured. It usually takes 2 swings - if he had to swing 4 times he probably would have died here.
Dirtybomb,3dmlfk,Xist3nce,4,Fri Jul 17 16:09:40 2015 UTC,"Actually to most of the fun mercs, (The squishy female ones minus nader) he does 1 shot."
Dirtybomb,3dmlfk,SquirmyBurrito,4,Fri Jul 17 16:21:48 2015 UTC,"He can oneshot Proxy, Aura, Sparks, and Kira without chopper (with chopper he can also oneshot vassili)."
Dirtybomb,3dmlfk,Xist3nce,3,Fri Jul 17 16:41:40 2015 UTC,"It's more of an issue with Kira and Proxy who frontline. He can take 2 remburgs to the face and still cut you down, since his shield gives him near Rhino HP. He takes no penalty for being seen, sometimes a bonus if you don't have much in a clip left. He's not OP like everyone says, but really sucks to fight when no one but you the 80 HP medic can see him."
Dirtybomb,3dmlfk,SquirmyBurrito,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:50:16 2015 UTC,"He can take one remburg to the face and still cut you down if he was cloaked. A second remburg headshot will kill him. If he is uncloaked he will die if headshotted by the remburg. This applies to all three shotguns. If I remember correctly, his cloak's health is somewhere around 75 (plus a damage gate). If this number is correct, every shotgun is capable of oneshotting his cloak without needing to land a headshot."
Dirtybomb,3dmlfk,Xist3nce,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:05:07 2015 UTC,"If he's close enough for a shotgun one shot to his cloak, he's close enough to poke you. The Remburg does cloak wrecking damage at about 3 meters max, which is about the range at which he is almost close enough to poke you. By the time the trigger is pulled again, his sword is already through you. Fire early and don't do enough damage, he lives. Fire late and you die anyway."
Dirtybomb,3dmlfk,SquirmyBurrito,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:21:00 2015 UTC,"Or you can fire and backpedal, thus allowing you to take out his cloak and headshot him once it is down. Alternatively, you could fire early and just shoot his cloak twice, then follow that up with a oneshot headshot at close range. You get five shots in your 'magazine'. Standing still while fighting a phantom is a terrible idea. He is mobile, and so should you."
Dirtybomb,3dmlfk,canzpl,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:14:00 2015 UTC,"Holding any gun reduces your movement speed to slower than his with the sword. Hence the issue of returning fire. If he's bad, this works, because then they don't know they can just keep walking through the gunfire. Then they pull out the kek, but since most don't know how to aim they die if the shield is down and a real gunfight is occurring. Same with fraggers."
Dirtybomb,3dmlfk,broadcasthenet,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:44:02 2015 UTC,"I think you misunderstand, when he attacks he is slowed down by a fair bit. So backpedaling to avoid his melee is a viable strategy. If he switches is smart he will switch to his kek and attempt to outgun you rather than continue to pursue you. If you (the one being attacked by phantom) know how to aim, you will win. If you don't, you will likely die."
Dirtybomb,3dmlfk,Xist3nce,0,Sat Jul 18 20:30:02 2015 UTC,"he 1 shots only 4 mercs in the game. proxy, aura, kira and sparks. rest is 2 or even 3 hits (rhino)"
Dirtybomb,3dmlfk,Kellervo,2,Fri Jul 17 16:41:57 2015 UTC,rhino is 2 hits with chopper. This is also assuming all other mercs have 100% health because they only need to lose 2hp before he can one shot the 110hp mercs and only 12hp before he can one shot the 120hp mercs.
Dirtybomb,3dmlfk,Xist3nce,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:45:17 2015 UTC,"Out of which Proxy the most mobile bubbly merc, being the most fun to pop around the battlefield with, sparks which is insanely fun to run around doing trickshots onto peoples' heads with the medgun. Kira isn't insanely fun, aura is moderately fun whenever trying to face a rush with the healwall of justice."
Dirtybomb,3dmlfk,canzpl,2,Fri Jul 17 16:47:00 2015 UTC,"By the same extension, some people find Phantom fun - and at the same time, all of those classes you define as fun can easily outrun him even by backpedaling."
Dirtybomb,3dmlfk,Xist3nce,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:52:09 2015 UTC,"He is fun for the stealth aspect, but he doesn't suffer from any punishment when seen, he again, gets a bonus for taking that damage, and you not having enough to end him left in the clip. In pubs, no one sees the big shadow running, being the on person that does you either have a shotgun (useless since if you can damage him with it it won't destroy his shield in time) as he's too close. Now if you run, you receive a kek spray to the back, which is immediate death."
Dirtybomb,3dmlfk,canzpl,-1,Fri Jul 17 17:01:41 2015 UTC,fun fact: all of the 4 i mentioned can simply run away from him and kite him because they are significantly faster
Dirtybomb,3dmlfk,AMasonJar,5,Fri Jul 17 16:55:09 2015 UTC,Even more fun fact: Running from an enemy that has a kek means you die with a .7 ttk :D
Dirtybomb,3dmlfk,Xist3nce,-2,Fri Jul 17 16:58:59 2015 UTC,not all of them have a kek
Dirtybomb,3dmlfk,canzpl,3,Fri Jul 17 17:33:11 2015 UTC,Any Phantom that knows how to be an asshole does.
Dirtybomb,3dmlfk,BigDrakow,0,Fri Jul 17 18:25:37 2015 UTC,"Anyone that knows how to play this game does. Which since 10 minimum servers are all people that know fragger is the best merc, and the kek is the best SMG. So yes, any phantom there has a kek."
Dirtybomb,3dmlfk,KingMoonfish,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:10:29 2015 UTC,not all of them. i met quite a bit with loadouts different than the kek one
Dirtybomb,3dmlfk,BigDrakow,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:57:36 2015 UTC,the main problem here is that he glitched through the floor so he wasn't visible till the last second.
Dirtybomb,3dmlfk,PonyNuke,3,Fri Jul 17 15:40:47 2015 UTC,"Figured I'd add this too: I don't think he glitched through the floor. Watch the clip again, you can see him crouching on the left hand side of the door as they enter. It seems the elevator moving caused him to jump a bit, but he was in there at the start."
Dirtybomb,3dmlfk,SquirmyBurrito,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:16:03 2015 UTC,"Yes he was there crouched from the start, but when the elevator starts moving you can see him disappearing into the floor for half a second. Don't know if it is the invisibility, the pavement in that point or a mix of both."
Dirtybomb,3dmlfk,PonyNuke,0,Fri Jul 17 17:18:06 2015 UTC,"Im not only talking about this. Im talking about phantoms in general. They are supposed to be sneaky, and flank you or come behind you. But all they need to do is put on the invisibility and run at you and melee you. Meanwhile other try to shoot you (harder since he is stronger when invis) + if you try to melee him before he can melee you, you almost never win because he can 1 shot you with his melee."
Dirtybomb,3dmlfk,SquirmyBurrito,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:43:28 2015 UTC,"Isn't what this phantom did exactly what you're claiming he is supposed to do? He was sneaky and came from behind them (well, attempted to anyway). He can only oneshot 4-5 of the 14 mercs in this game."
Dirtybomb,3dmlfk,BigDrakow,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:53:47 2015 UTC,"Yes, but this is just 1 example. So many times have I seen and have been against phantoms who just run at you and melee kill you. I feel there is little, maybe no counter against it. I feel you should atleast be able to try and melee kill him before he melee kills you. But because he usually 1 shot people its not that easy."
Dirtybomb,3dpctb,Bhastly,3,Sat Jul 18 04:01:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah he had his chance. If he right clicked instead of left clicked, you'd have died. He got what he deserves."
Dirtybomb,3dpctb,Keldrath,3,Sat Jul 18 04:10:44 2015 UTC,"Katana heavy does 90 damage on hit, and if you look at the hp bar, you can see that Phantom did indeed use a heavy attack. Most phantoms use a loadout card with the ""Chopper"" perk, which puts the heavy attack damage at 108, but only a few cards have that particular perk."
Dirtybomb,3dpctb,GrassWaterDirtHorse,1 point,Sat Jul 18 07:42:45 2015 UTC,He could have had one of the katana cards that doesn't have chopper I guess. I just assume they all do.
Dirtybomb,3dpctb,Keldrath,0,Sat Jul 18 07:50:22 2015 UTC,"He really did, Phantom's pretty damn good with chopper, without it, he's nearly useless."

If you have an explosive merc use one explosive while he's far away, and one when he's almost right on top of you (but keep backing up). The first explosive will chip his health so you can kill him with guns, the second will kill him if he kills you at melee range.

Dirtybomb,3dn5wj,SquirmyBurrito,-4,Fri Jul 17 18:36:55 2015 UTC,"120 health with an additional XX HP that decreases over time at a steady rate, this rate is affected by how fast you're moving and damage taken. It immediately disappears if you perform any action (barring bugs). It is gated so extra damage does not bleed over into Phantom's standard health pool. 410 speed is below average. Phantom is slower than 50% of the mercs in this game. Phantom is not completely invisible, but he is mostly invisible (wiki says 90%). His M2 attack is among the slowest of the melee weapons. Prior to its nerf alongside the release of Phantom and his katana, the Stiletto did the exact same amount of damage (90, 108 with chopper). These are all facts."
Dirtybomb,3dn5wj,Deathcommand,-5,Sat Jul 18 01:16:48 2015 UTC,I get all the hate with him because his shield is seriously BS.   But honestly. 90% invisible is visible.

Dirtybomb,3dohnq,Duranous,3,Sat Jul 18 00:12:04 2015 UTC,"Fletcher's issues are bug/usability/mediocre options if they give him these quality of life changes it.will be a direct buff.  Bushwhacker's turret is good but if they were to change the kek I don't think he would be out of line.  Proxy isn't bad but she also has issues that make here less desirable on a competitive level, mostly that her mines become worse the better players are."
Dirtybomb,3dohnq,wigg1es,4,Sat Jul 18 01:10:27 2015 UTC,Bushwacker is only good because he has the kek. His turret isn't great. It's not a tf2 turret. It's easily killed and doesn't kill a lot. Proxy is actually fine I think. Mines are very powerful on defense and she has a decent array of weapons to access. Fletcher takes the most skill but can be the most lethal. Sticky grenades need either sequential detonation or a buff to explosion radius.
Dirtybomb,3dohnq,GrassWaterDirtHorse,3,Sat Jul 18 00:54:19 2015 UTC,The turret has very good DPM if it's allowed to survive. It's more like a Mini-sentry than an actual big sentry.

Dirtybomb,3dohnq,wigg1es,2,Sat Jul 18 01:32:45 2015 UTC,"If you like getting +5 lock on XP then yes, it's absolutely amazing. But if you want your turret to actually kill people, it sucks. It's hardly a deterrent. You can beat it 1 v 1 more often than not if you aren't terrible."
Dirtybomb,3dohnq,Maxillaws,4,Sat Jul 18 01:41:54 2015 UTC,Now what happens when the Bushwacker plays off of his turret?  It effectively turns it into a 2v1  You either kill the bushwacker and the turret finishes you off or you kill the turret and the bushwacker kills you
Dirtybomb,3dohnq,Ghosthree3,4,Sat Jul 18 04:45:47 2015 UTC,"Lol, this guy actually thinks the turret is supposed to 1v1 people."

Caps Lock is by far the best key for crouching. It's easier to hit at the same time as Space, meaning that it's good for long jumps, and it's even easier to hit during combat for me because my pinky finger naturally rests there. Also, when I have my finger on Control I have to rotate my hand slightly meaning that it's harder to hit Q if I need to use my ability while crouching."

And I'm not gonna restart my computer to change the registry to test it out, then restart it again to change the registry back.  Regardless, I like having it rebound because it means I don't accidentally end up typing an entire paragraph in all caps without realising and then having to delete the whole thing and type it again."

Dirtybomb,3dm46s,Kazzei,3,Fri Jul 17 15:54:49 2015 UTC,"In addition to what Bear said - engage at range. Rhino's minigun drops off pretty quickly at range, and while the Ahnuld is the best shotgun for longer ranges, just about every SMG and AR can outpace it in terms of damage output. In wide open areas (both objectives in Underground, pretty much any EV escort) there are plenty of places where you can whittle away at him from a safe distance.  If the Rhino is stuck in close quarters, your best bet is to get some grenades in there, especially if he has an Aura with him. Skyhammer's grenade works in a pinch but your team should really have at least one of the grenadier classes."
Dirtybomb,3dm46s,Kazzei,-7,Fri Jul 17 16:55:34 2015 UTC,I don't hope so. every time I play this game i wonder: how did such dumb shit developers make such a great game?. honestly if i did not like this game so much i wouldve been GONE with my money.

Dirtybomb,3dm46s,Drakengard,0,Fri Jul 17 19:03:46 2015 UTC,"This is where you are wrong. I am a pathetic loser. All i do in my free time is play video games. I played a lot of games and I quit playing a lot of games. When i first played this game, it already impressed me. Almost all the system setting and configurations were according to the standards a pc game fanatic. Vsync off. highest resolution. uncapped FPS etc etc. there are many many options that you can turn off and the system menu gives you plenty of options. The menu looks amazing. so do the in game graphics. theyre basic, but they look perfectly fine. My in game FPS in the menu was about 200 and my GPU (770gtx) is rather outdated. my FPS is game was just as good. And that was not the only thing that was good. The engine of this game gives me wet dreams. it's like source engine, but smoother and it doesnt feel outdated. The game alt tabs INSTANTLY where csgo takes 3 seconds because it is coded by a bunch of dumb idiots. this game feels sooooooo smooth. I have never experienced a game that feels as smooth as this. honestly.  then on to enjoyability, I enjoyed playing this game. A lot. The fact that it was very skill based, fast paced, objective orientated, and as mentioned earlier smooth gameplay, gave me a gaming experience like i have never before.   There we're some things that i did not like. for instance the retardation called loadout card. but i did not care as much about that since the game made up for it. same thing for the waiting times.  In the 20 hours that i played i am very certain that this game is really good. this is EXACTLY the reason why i care so much about the whole phantom oredeal. If this game wasn't so good. I would have just dropped it and carried on."
Dirtybomb,3dqsbp,jonbaa,0,Sat Jul 18 15:38:02 2015 UTC,"The KEK-10. It's clearly dominant over the other SMGs   Everyone says this, but when I finally got Bushwhacker last week and tried out all of his guns, KEK-10 felt like the worst one. It feels like you're shooting an airsoft gun, and does comparable damage to one too.  Settled for the SMG-9 for now, although I'm saving some extra credits to buy the good Blishlok loadout because I kinda have a hunch that Blishlok is the best SMG if you git gud."
Dirtybomb,3dqsbp,dejecaal,5,Sat Jul 18 16:05:54 2015 UTC,Everything you posted is backwards.
Dirtybomb,3dqsbp,Ballsackologist,0,Sat Jul 18 16:14:47 2015 UTC,"That's exactly why I posted it. People keep praising the KEK, but I just can't see what all the fuss is about."
Dirtybomb,3dqsbp,dejecaal,3,Sat Jul 18 17:03:34 2015 UTC,"Best DPS with a high rate of fire, 45 round magazine, and little to no recoil or spread."
Dirtybomb,3dqsbp,BeardyDuck,2,Sat Jul 18 21:56:17 2015 UTC,"I have the KEK-10 and Blishlok, I'm a fan of the Kek-10 though.  Yeah, it is a little weak, but the gigantic clip size, the accuracy, and the lack of recoil make it really strong when you get those head shots. It also shoots fairly fast, which means you can string together head shots pretty quickly for quick kills.  The Blishlok, and I haven't looked up the numbers, most likely has more damage per shot but shoots slower.  This means it's stronger if you're missing, but you won't be killing people as fast as if you're getting headshots with the KEK-10 due to its higher firing speed."
Dirtybomb,3dqsbp,dejecaal,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:21:38 2015 UTC,"On paper the difference between SMG-9 and KEK-10 isn't that large, with the KEK-10 doing a tiny bit less damage but having a higher rate of fire. On paper the KEK-10 would appear better since it has a higher DPS on both bodyshots and headshots.  However, in practice I just found it much easier to perform better with SMG-9. I was getting more headshots, they were doing more damage, and stuff was generally just dying faster. Maybe it's just because I'm used to playing with Crotzni on Sawbonez, and SMG-9 handles quite similarly to it.  Anyway, on the topic of Blishlok...  Contrary to what you said, KEK-10's massive fire rate means that it doesn't need as much tracking ability as slower firerate guns. If you can't accurately track your enemies, with a faster firerate you get in more hits during the time your crosshair actually is on the enemy than you would with a slower firerate.  Blishlok, on the other hand, requires you to make the shots count. If you're just swiveling your aim around the enemy, where a KEK user would get two or three headshots you will get one. However, it does a lot more damage per shot than KEK-10 (11 versus 18, or 22 versus 36 on headshots), which means that you'll be killing the weaker classes in 2 headshots and one bodyshot, and the stronger classes in 3-5 headshots.  The thing is, on paper KEK-10 still does more DPS than Blishlok; the only SMG that outDPSes the KEK is Crotzni. It's just that sometimes there's more to performance than just numbers.  It could be just a mental thing, since shooting 5-6 headshots on one guy with the KEK-10 and not killing them just made the gun feel silly and completely powerless, but after trying them all for some time I just ended up preferring the other ones over KEK.  Also, going by the amount of attention it gets KEK is a strong contender for adjustments (read: nerfs) in a future patch."
Dirtybomb,3dqsbp,Blittzzo,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:01:20 2015 UTC,The only reason I don't like the bishlock is because the sight looks bad and the gun sounds like a pistol
Dirtybomb,3dqsbp,dejecaal,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:16:12 2015 UTC,"As an interesting fact, the Blishlok is very similar to Enemy Territory's Thompson/MP40.  It has the same rate of fire, does more comparable damage than the other weapons, and the spread and accuracy feel quite similar too although I need to test it more in that department.  It's another matter if such a weapon works in Dirty Bomb's environment, though."
Dirtybomb,3dqsbp,Closet_Indie,2,Sun Jul 19 00:31:04 2015 UTC,I don't want to be mean but once you get some more aim practice in you'll realize that the blishlock and the smg-9 are inferior smgs when compared to the kek-10 and croztni. There's a reason that comp players don't use the smg-9.
Dirtybomb,3dqsbp,dejecaal,0,Sat Jul 18 17:49:09 2015 UTC,"I'm a competitive player myself. If there's one thing I've learnt from following and being part of competitive scenes for a good while, it's that a lot of competitive players using a certain weapon or strategy doesn't guarantee that it's actually the best one there is, or even good.  The majority of players, and this includes competitive players, don't actually research things on their own. They look at what others (especially players better than them) do and blindly copy them. Even people at the very top end of the skill curve tend to look to other good people for ideas more often than experimenting with brand new stuff.  There's a small subset of players that actually research new stuff, and actually useful things will slowly propagate from them to the greater playerbase.  I'm not saying that SMG-9 and Blishlok are better than the KEK-10. All I'm saying is that rather than just going with the KEK-10 because everyone says it's the best, I'm trying them all out to see for myself. Right now I'm preferring the other options over KEK-10 on Bushwhacker, but it's very much possible that I'm wrong."
Dirtybomb,3dn5r5,thrnee,12,Fri Jul 17 17:02:31 2015 UTC,I would rather splash damage spend their time improving the core game mode instead of adding modes that don't fit this style of game well. Execution mode doesn't feel right in a game with such fast gameplay and will never be balanced in dirty bomb.
Dirtybomb,3dn5r5,Closet_Indie,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:44:41 2015 UTC,"I agree, it's boring as hell too, slows down a fast paced game with too many breaks.  Most of the levels they've shown for this suck like most their normal ones too, lots of pointless areas that players are barely going to use."
Dirtybomb,3dn5r5,Cr4zy,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:16:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah, respawn game modes and no-respawn game modes are so fundamentally different from each other that you can't balance the game around both."

Dirtybomb,3dn5r5,El_Ejcovero,-1,Fri Jul 17 17:54:01 2015 UTC,Honestly I loved it last time. I don't understand the hate it gets. Rolling 2 medics keeps the match alive longer than 5-6 kills and it becomes fairly tactical and tense. I just want XP to scale differently. A kill should reward some Game Mode XP because killing is a valid way to win the match.
Dirtybomb,3dn5r5,I_EAT_APPLE_CORES,2,Fri Jul 17 23:20:25 2015 UTC,"Considering the changes to revive mechanics, I can't see medics being that effective (note: I'm not saying they will be ineffective). It's so easy to gib people these days since you can do it even after they've been revived."
Dirtybomb,3dn5r5,dejecaal,2,Sat Jul 18 00:22:48 2015 UTC,"I think most of the people that have a problem with it think that having more features is an issue. Having multifaceted gameplay is always nice, and has almost no downsides. Like how ARAM and league goes, it's not the most popular game type, but it's something you do every once in a while and it's a fun diversion. I think people need to relax more and just have fun."

Dirtybomb,3dn5r5,dejecaal,5,Sat Jul 18 00:23:59 2015 UTC,"Yes but still then you had classes and same hp. For me (100% personally opinion) it doesnt fit to stuff like turrets, medstations, kira lasers and airstrikes that destroys a full team in 2 seconds and stuff. If you want to create a s&d mode remove all abilities add smoke grenades and boom youve a bad f2p game... I dont see why they developed that mode instead of some fast paced oriented gamemode."
Dirtybomb,3dn5r5,shkyy,-2,Sat Jul 18 00:29:00 2015 UTC,"Like they say in the video, it's supposed to make the transition from other games easier. I kinda doubt the different game mode will be the primary issue CS players would face when trying Dirty Bomb for the first time, though."
Dirtybomb,3dn5r5,dejecaal,3,Sat Jul 18 00:31:35 2015 UTC,"As a CS player in DMG, no. Starting this game was a cakewalk in all senses. No one has any game sense, no one plays objective, and no one can aim. Fact is, there was no challenge until the 10 minimum servers. I do believe however that this gamemode is fun, but poorly implemented for the way the classes are balanced. One sneaky rhino destroys a team. If anyone plays fragger, they win the whole map.

We did quite well at defending, and they didn't manage to plant C4 on the Pump Controls, but they blew up the Extractor Fan Controls very quickly and they easily made it down the escalators to the lower levels. Our defense didn't really kick in until the last objective.  When we were attacking things didn't go as well. We had a much harder time than they did destroying the Extractor Fan Controls, and their defense at the Pump Controls was even more solid than ours had been. 30 seconds on the clock and we looked set to lose.  Until I saw something on my minimap. Over to the left side of the map, an Aura was making her way through the hallway where the Barrier secondary objective is. All the fighting was taking place much further forward and the medic had gotten behind them. The Aura plants the C4 with so little time on the clock that they couldn't possibly defuse it.

Definitely agree that beta is the time to do it, it's not a full release yet.  I guess for me it feels so polished anyway (compared to say, BF4 launch if anyone remembers that), that it feels like a fully released game (albeit F2P, not that that excuses bugs) and thus I feel like treating it as such in my criticism, but realise that it wouldn't be fair to do so.

Dirtybomb,3dlvyc,DarkangelUK,2,Fri Jul 17 11:38:30 2015 UTC,"That last section of Bridge is my favourite of all the maps.  It's got lots of interconnecting pathways, lots of choke points, and can all happen quickly if you're not paying attention.  It's the opposite of Chapel part 2."
Dirtybomb,3dlvyc,pnellesen,2,Fri Jul 17 13:15:28 2015 UTC,"I had a game more or less exactly like this on Trainyard, felt like the hardest attacking round ever and completed the map with about 30 secs to go, go on defense and as a team we just worked. There wasn't even a need for chat, medics revived and healed, soldiers supplied ammo, team covered while defusing, it was an awesome experience and more than made up for the shitty games."
Dirtybomb,3dlvyc,pockypimp,2,Fri Jul 17 13:24:52 2015 UTC,Great story. This is why I love objective games - you'd never get a story like this from TDM :p
Dirtybomb,3dlvyc,canzpl,2,Fri Jul 17 16:27:53 2015 UTC,I had something similar happen on Chapel.  Playing objective on offense we barely fixed the EV and barely got it to the construction site before time ran out.  My team is expecting the same level of fight for that last point.  Surprise we roll the last point thanks to 3 of us being Skyhammer and dropping airstrikes.  Without any coordination we somehow got our airstrikes timed one after the other with a few seconds in between.  Basically pinning the defenders behind their spawn wall while a Proxy ran the first EMP charge in and a respawned Proxy grabbed the second and ran it in immediately.
Dirtybomb,3dlvyc,FreelancerJosiah,4,Fri Jul 17 19:42:45 2015 UTC,the bug with the phantom cloak is real ;q i had that twice yesterday
Dirtybomb,3dlvyc,zwjerka,1 point,Fri Jul 17 10:35:46 2015 UTC,"Reading this makes me sad. As far as I can tell, NA really gets screwed on actual decent players willing to PTO. I tried to play it for a bunch of games, but now I just play either Fragger or Vassili and shoot things because nobody's gonna cover me when I PTO, nobody's gonna give me backup, and I'm probably already dead because of Phantom."
Dirtybomb,3dmtv5,vampwood,4,Fri Jul 17 15:31:28 2015 UTC,"A bit off topic... But why does everyone seem to play this game at the lowest possible settings?  Genuinely curious. Is this common for FPSes? This is really my first experience with a PC FPS, as I ascended back in January."
Dirtybomb,3dmtv5,ColsonIRL,7,Fri Jul 17 17:47:56 2015 UTC,"Stable FPS is really important to have consistent aim and so is being able to see your opponents clearly without dust and smoke obstructing it. I have a 144hz monitor so I play at minimal settings to achieve at least 144fps as possible. In my and many others opinion 60 fps is the minimum you need to have consistent and solid aim. There are also input delay implications of having lower fps, but that requires math to explain that I'm not going to here."
Dirtybomb,3dmtv5,HereticKitsune,3,Fri Jul 17 17:55:09 2015 UTC,Definitely true. I'm stuck at a framerate of like 20-30 FPS with a pretty solid FPS config. I still do pretty okay but I could do so much better otherwise.
Dirtybomb,3dmtv5,ColsonIRL,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:14:46 2015 UTC,"Gotcha. I'm able to run it at 120+ cps at max, so I guess it isn't really an issue for me. Thanks for the explanation!"
Dirtybomb,3dmtv5,tigrn914,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:06:49 2015 UTC,Same here.
Dirtybomb,3dmtv5,herminzerah,4,Sat Jul 18 07:57:14 2015 UTC,"For games like Witcher 3 where graphical fidelity is more important that lowest input lag/highest refresh, graphics are cranked up. In a competitive FPS games all that matters if ease of sight and speed, that's it. This goes hand in hand with low graphics settings."
Dirtybomb,3dmtv5,Xist3nce,3,Fri Jul 17 21:18:28 2015 UTC,"If the fletcher was dead, that'll disappear, because fletcher needs that much of a kick in the dick."
Dirtybomb,3dmtv5,AMasonJar,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:40:00 2015 UTC,"I don't think they disappear on death, though. As soon as he respawned, I could bet he would be mashing that E key.   Or a teammate would look at you and A) be very confused, or B) panic and unload on the bomb, instantly killing both him and this guy."
Dirtybomb,3dmtv5,Xist3nce,2,Fri Jul 17 22:15:31 2015 UTC,"Yep, there is a bug currently that hasn't been addressed. Bombs attached to enemies when you die, are gone when you come back. Attached to land however is fine, unless it's an objective, in which it also disappears. As I've double stuck someone, got gunned down with an instant spawn, hit E and nada. Happens every time. I can watch the skill icon even lose the 2 placed markers."
Dirtybomb,3drwd5,r_acrimonger,6,Sat Jul 18 21:32:37 2015 UTC,Who and why should I care.
Dirtybomb,3drwd5,BeardyDuck,3,Sat Jul 18 21:52:44 2015 UTC,Literally who?
Dirtybomb,3drwd5,Stuhlgewitter,4,Sat Jul 18 22:41:21 2015 UTC,"Some girl claimed she was raped and decided to carry around a mattress until she got justice. Turned out she was lying and just wanted publicity, she was using the mattress stunt as one of her uni projects (?). Was still in touch with her 'rapist' and was sending him messages saying she loved him etc.  Read about it a while ago so might be a little rough. Might be better to Google it if you want the full story."

If you're fragging on pubs you're bad and you should feel bad!"" -mentality has always been a common cop-out among people who don't have the aim to get frags. Instead of facing the fact that they really just aren't too stellar at video game, they're rationalizing to themselves that players who are better than them are actually worse than them.  Even if you completely ignore the objective and do nothing but frag the enemy team, wiping out a significant portion of their team will still help your allies complete the objective if they so desire. Obviously if you just get odd single frags doing this you're not really pulling your weight, but you get the idea.   Don't be stingy with ammo or health packs. You get 10xp just for throwing one and they cooldown fast. Consider placing a few behind common cover spots.   Do be a bit stingy with them, especially health packs. Sometimes you'll need them in a critical situation and if you've tossed them all out it might cost you your life."
Dirtybomb,3dm59j,TroubleEntendre,2,Fri Jul 17 13:58:42 2015 UTC,"He's not talking just about frags, but of KDR specifically. Too many pubs I see are too afraid to PTO because they don't want to die. They peek around corners and take potshots at enemies, slowly filching kills in the hopes that eventually the area will be safe enough to move up. Of course, this doesn't happen because the respawn timer is 24 seconds at the most—not nearly long enough for kills to matter very much."
Dirtybomb,3dm59j,Exayex,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:37:36 2015 UTC,"I really think all of this is a context argument.  OP is thinking of one type of player and situation, while the counter-arguments are thinking of a different one.  I agree with both sides; yes PTFO is very important, and yes getting frags is important. Players shouldn't be polar to one of those sides though. The middle ground of getting frags and knowing what your true objective is, is very important.  A sniper might get a K:D of 7.2 but have a lower objective based score. Why, because he is covering and counter-sniping the objective. Those frags mean something and the ratio is high enough to even if he wasn't playing the objective he took down enough people without dying that it made an impact on enemy reinforcements.  While someone charging into an objective to body block for the defuser is also a great player to have, but having good aim and the ability to take enemies down is also key."
Dirtybomb,3dm59j,acousticdank,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:56:56 2015 UTC,"This kind of ""Frags are useless, obj only. If you're fragging on pubs you're bad and you should feel bad!"" -mentality has always been a common cop-out among people who don't have the aim to get frags.   And this is the kind of dickwaving bullshit that kills a community. It's not a cop out to admit that to being bad at some tasks in game, and better at others. It's not a cop out to look at the fucking scoreboard and see that the Aura with 5 kills, 10 deaths, and 8000 points is fucking carrying your team. Pretending that there's only one kind of player that matters, and if you can't be that player you're not contributing to the team and should be somehow ashamed (""cop out?"" for real?) is dumb as fuck.   Nobody--literally nobody--is saying that if you're fragging that you're bad and you should feel bad, so quit whining. What OP is doing is pointing out that racking up kills is often--not always! but often enough to consider--secondary to playing the objective. We've all played a match where we were dominating the other team in nearly every firefight, and still we managed to lose. The difference is the other team played the objective.  I don't know about you, but I like winning."
Dirtybomb,3dm59j,SgtTittyfist,-1,Fri Jul 17 20:33:19 2015 UTC,"I main Bushwhacker and while my speed at objectives is great in pubs, if we have a second engineer I can guarantee you I'm going for frags first.  If you're good at fragging, you do far more good for your team.  Setting up spawn traps and holding multiple people in their spawn is fantastic in pubs.  But to do this, you have to be good enough to win 2 vs 1 and string together kill streaks.  KDR isn't meaningless though.  Last night I dropped a 58/13.  Second place on my team was 5/13.  I can tell you I am 95% the reason we won that match defending on Chapel.  People just need to play to their strengths.  Suck at fragging?  That's cool, be a pocket medic or an engineer.  Able to dominate a game yourself?  Play somebody who can frag hard and destroy multiple people in their spawn.  And if you're top fragging, change classes to help the situation.  I use Bushwhacker for spawn traps, Kira for Chapel and Bridge EV and Fragger for when they stack medics."
Dirtybomb,3dm59j,SgtTittyfist,3,Fri Jul 17 18:48:15 2015 UTC,"A lot of it depends on your class.  If you are a Proxy, getting a high KDR is not nearly as important as completing objectives.  You can do both of course, but you should be leaning towards objectives over KDR.  Certain other classes like Fragger are more of a KDR type of class.    I do agree that popping out is annoying as fuck though.  For example, skyhammers in particular love to camp that left wall in the defender spawn in stage 3 of Chapel.  Meanwhile they have almost no line of sight on the objective.  I've seen them continuing to pop out while the objective is being planted.    It all comes down to situational awareness."
Dirtybomb,3dm59j,pisshead_,3,Fri Jul 17 14:02:53 2015 UTC,"There are classes for assaulting for a reason. Fraggers, Naders and Phantom aren't designed around helping the team, but instead their goal is to harm the enemy team as much as possible. Considering that you get the same amount of points for a revive or a heal as for a proper kill, it's not uncommon for supports such as Sawbonez to be way on top of the leaderboard, despite the team's Fragger doing his job perfectly well at a 3:1 K/D.  Basically: Points don't matter, same as KDR. Just play the class you have the way it's intended to be used and you'll be doing your job."
Dirtybomb,3dm59j,SgtTittyfist,2,Fri Jul 17 15:06:49 2015 UTC,"Those assault classes score the most when they're clearing the objective and moving with their team.  If they're off killing players nowhere near the objective, which a lot of them are, they're not helping.  Using that frag is great to get a kill, but it's even better if you use it to scatter the enemy away from a choke or objective.  I see almost no one outside of Rhino even using suppressing fire, they're only firing when someone's head peaks out. Half the point of that high ROF weapon is to lay lead down range so they don't even stick their head up to begin with."
Dirtybomb,3dm59j,Maxillaws,3,Fri Jul 17 15:17:15 2015 UTC,"Roamers can be a very useful asset for a team. Picking off stragglers or annoying the team just enough from the back to make them lose focus can be huge, just ask competitive TF2 players.  Regardless, my point simply was that neither KDR nor points matter in any way, shape or form. Classes simply have to do their job, wether that be locking down an objective, reviving the team's strongest units or simply supplying ammo.

There are far too many people playing right now who are basically playing TDM and they're losing games for their team.  I was in a game today with three snipers hiding in the ceiling of Underground. All of them had fabulous 2/1 or higher KDRs, but they lost the game for us.  And even if you're killing, a 20 who's 20/20 is better for the team than a guy who's 10/0."

Dirtybomb,3dm59j,iamtehronin,0,Fri Jul 17 15:30:54 2015 UTC,You'll notice only the very first paragraph discusses KDR.  The rest are general objective based tips.
Dirtybomb,3dm59j,BuckPlankMcIronStag,0,Fri Jul 17 16:22:42 2015 UTC,That's why I like playing Phantom on certain maps. I enjoy going behind the enemy team and picking players off when they are respawning or busy fighting someone else.  Sure I'm not actively playing the objective but I am helping my team with that by limiting the amount of players who come in
Dirtybomb,3dm59j,abienz,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:56:20 2015 UTC,"I have to disagree again here. The players that are ""nowhere near the objective"" are one of the biggest threats to you. It's these guys that can pop up behind you with full health and mop you up while you're looking at the other players spawns. There are multiple lanes in DB for a reason. The other lanes need to be guarded. That Fragger killing people off on another lane is very useful."
Dirtybomb,3dm59j,lolpierandom,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:48:47 2015 UTC,"I see almost no one outside of Rhino even using suppressing fire, they're only firing when someone's head peaks out.    Why would you waste ammo and give away your position for nothing? Surely better to wait till they come out and kill them than fire at dirt."

Dirtybomb,3dm59j,abienz,6,Sat Jul 18 00:20:49 2015 UTC,Lol I barely play the objective at all and I top the scoreboard most games. I would rather have a team that can kill players than a team of proxy's that throw themselves at the objective and get slaughtered. Most likely the c4 will be instantly defused or the EV instantly destroyed because the team got wiped because no one can kill anything
Dirtybomb,3dm59j,Patriot_Brother,0,Fri Jul 17 12:24:25 2015 UTC,"That's because you're not helping with covering the objective with your killing ability.  Engineers and medics rarely, if ever, top the tables by kills alone."

Dirtybomb,3dm59j,Fire42uck,0,Fri Jul 17 19:36:12 2015 UTC,"A Medic/Engi can top a scoreboard if they play their roles right. More than once I topped the scoreboard as this classes. It usually comes down to a mix between kills and objective playing/healing and reviving.  However, it's true that it is a lot harder for this classes to top the scoreboard. And the longer the round goes, the harder it is.  Short rounds usually have a Engi that completed all the objectives, or a Medic that was crucial to holding the front line by reviving and such."
Dirtybomb,3dm59j,JaskaJii,5,Sat Jul 18 04:26:02 2015 UTC,"I hate people that just run in and try to deliver the objective. You first have to kill the enemies and NOT die (so KD matters of course, but not only) and THEN deliver the objective. Same with planting bombs. If you get a ""ninja"" plant, then congratulations, you got some XP but that's it in most of the cases... And i won't revive people in combat, only if i am a medic of course or if i can revive a medic, that is important and would have to wait ~20 seconds to respawn. And i disagree to a lot of your tips, you seem kind of new to shooters  and more of a theoretical type."
Dirtybomb,3dm59j,-sYmbiont-,0,Fri Jul 17 12:59:09 2015 UTC,"If your team runs with you and body blocks, you can cap an objective even under heavy enemy fire.  Me and my buddy do it with Proxy and Rhino all the time."

Dirtybomb,3dm59j,Malc0lmx,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:59:16 2015 UTC,"Yes, very true.   One effective strategy is: ""You guys defend us while we cap."" Now you can do your body block strategy while also having people kill people.  Body blocking only really works when you've got no flanks. Otherwise any good player will headshot the fuck out of you, making the TTK on you super low, and therefore allowing them to take no damage while they then subsequently kill your teammate. Even if your teammate stops and tries to kill the opponent, he's now faced with a losing battle because the other guy has the jump on him."

Dirtybomb,3dm59j,SelfDefeatingChris,0,Fri Jul 17 13:52:03 2015 UTC,"I hate people that just run in and try to deliver the objective.   In a pub game full of camping attackers, this, to me, is the only viable course of action (on Chapel, specifically). The problem isn't actually killing the enemies—it's making a coordinated push with your team. Moving the objective forward hopefully puts a marker on the map saying ""here's the box! Look at the box"" and focuses everyone on a central point. Moreover, there's a prime opportunity to charge in there with bullets and explosives when the pubbies on the other team are scrambling to return the thing."
Dirtybomb,3dm59j,DerpsterJ,2,Fri Jul 17 17:42:25 2015 UTC,"Why is this being downvoted? This is good advice. But I guess it's largely meaningless since if you don't already play the objective but for the KDR, you won't give a flying fuck about this.  It's so annoying to be in matches where I'm the only one going for the objective while everyone else is corner camping somewhere or chasing people on the other side of the map.  Can you even see any kind of KDR stat anywhere in your profile? I haven't seen any. So fuck it."

There are often times when killing a player will get them back to defend faster than allowing them to run back.  If you're getting kills and playing the objective you will outscore someone playing the objective and getting less kills. I'm not saying kills aren't important, I'm saying that KDR isn't important compared to playing the objective."
Dirtybomb,3dm59j,Polystigma,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:51:28 2015 UTC,"I've got a slight problem with this.   I'm not a super high KDR God, but then again I don't go 0/420 (Swag). It's really all about how you play the game. This is the same argument with Phantom actually having a slight purpose in his current state. If you play to kill and not die you can get 2-3 kills and take out almost half the enemy team ( assuming this is an 8v8).   That opens up doors for your team. Assuming the rest of your teammates are capable of going one for one, you've guaranteed a wave win for your team. Now you're sitting pretty, either capturing objectives as attackers, or repositioning on the defense.   Sure you've got a shitty score, and all kills, but who cares? Whipes aren't factored into score. Lane defenses aren't factored into score. It's why good Vasilli's can ruin games. They can get one or two picks and really turn the tide of the match.   Now with all that being said. If you're the sad kid in the back of the map trying to pick off one guy and not getting him, yet you don't reposition because it puts you at risk of dying.... then you've got a problem. Now you're not helping your team, and even if you do manage to get one kill you've done shit else for your team. Now you're deadweight and even though your K/D might be nice, you're not an asset what so ever to your team.  I think the above paragraph is more so what OP was getting at, but for those who like to argue "" K/D doesn't mean shit"", you might want to rephrase that to ""K/D isn't everything""  TL;DR: K/D might not be the biggest part to a good player, but a good one doesn't necessarily mean that a person isn't helping."""
Dirtybomb,3dm59j,Polystigma,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:42:18 2015 UTC,"In my opinion, the onlynote thing that matters is score because it's the only way to reflect how much you helped your team. A guy with 6000 points mostly from kills, was more useful for the team than the guy with 2500 points that was always right besides the objective.   Note: what really matters is what each individual member of a team does to help their team accomplish objectives. For example, a level 6 with not much experience/bad aim decides to zerg the objective, while a level 25 with a Phantom kills everyone who comes near his teammate. There is no real way to say which of them was more important (because without the other, they would have both failed), that's why I said what I said about score."
Dirtybomb,3dm59j,plagues138,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:21:06 2015 UTC,"When I pub as Sawbonez you'll almost never see me with my team, especially when I'm defending. At first you might think that sounds dumb and I'm not helping, but that's where you'd be wrong.  I have pretty decent aim and the Crotzni + medpack combo makes Sawbonez a very deadly/sustained flanker, If I were to sit with my team I'd be suiciding trying to pick up out of position Artys that can't aim with the dreiss (being topical.)  Flanking and picking medics/engis/secondary DPS is much more effective than throwing medpacks while the entire enemy team collapses on Main.  Not saying that the KDR itself is important, but basically this."
Dirtybomb,3dm59j,Barfhelmet,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:24:28 2015 UTC,"TL;DR: DB is an objective based team game, act like it."
Dirtybomb,3dm59j,AMasonJar,1 point,Fri Jul 17 11:42:27 2015 UTC,Well.  This is a team based game.  If everyone ran straight at the objective it would be easy for the enemy team to clean up constantly.   There need to be DPS people with high KDR for engineers to perform otherwise shit would never get done.  I also chase a lot of people around and it typically ends up  with me getting an extra kill or two but of course I also die some times. Pay attention to your respawn timer before you start chasing.   Don't drop off too much health / ammo unless you are sure your team can control the area. You can end up giving the enemy team ammo / health making them win the next firefight with your resources.   Push forward as far as you want just leave a guy behind at the objective. If no one stays behind then you do it.  Most maps are more controllable when you have pushed enemies closer to their spawn.   Auras health station should always be around Aura as she needs to be somewhat mid action so this will always be moved by default or at least should be.   The same goes for Kira but opposite. She should stay back and control the bigger picture and should pick it up when she moves and redeploy it wherever she wants to stand. Give the team this info so they know where to find ammo.   The rest looks like nice things to do.
Dirtybomb,3dm59j,MonkeyXing,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:00:04 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say the heal station should always near Aura, the whole point of it being given to her is so she can drop it and screw off to go somewhere else to play a lower HP Proxy sans the engineer thing."
Dirtybomb,3dm59j,Rusemaster1,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:22:14 2015 UTC,"You might be right.  The way i play Aura is that i stick on the main groups behind at more or less all times. I place the station a little bit behind them on the spot that feels the safest. I use the station to mainly keep myself alive so i can revive if neeeded and close enough that players that take dmg can pull back and heal themselves. This not only helps me watch the flank but in most cases i can hold it by myself on top of being able to res people. Please note that i blay with the smg and not the shotgun as it makes it a bit easier.  For Proxy and other fast moving low HP characters i like to play Sawbonez. He can heal wherever without waiting for health station, with potent packs that fully heals the lower HP classes. He has more health which makes him more viable in the close quarter action you will meet with these faster ""flanking"" classes. His weapon is tons better than the Aura smg. The only downside is the speed, but as you want to stay a little in the back it is survivable."
Dirtybomb,3dm59j,Joshin11,1 point,Sat Jul 18 09:58:44 2015 UTC,"I see the three medic mercs as having a range specialty: Aura is fastest (out of any other in the merc in the game, actually) and is suited for close quarters fighting and dodging (giving her a window to regen through the heal station if she's by it), Sawbonez is best at mid range where he can land shots with his AR and throw packs to people taking cover, and Sparks is best at long range where people aren't taking quite as much damage or she could never hope to reach the others further up with a medpack throw, plus if someone dies further away from the fight (and wasn't insta-gibbed by a Vassili or something), they're less likely to get finished off if the enemy team has other problems. And she can snipe with the Revivr too to offer her team some help in the form of DPS if she can't heal them as well. She's not as slow as Sawbonez but nowhere too close to top speed, and she really only needs the speed she has for positioning herself."

Dirtybomb,3dpne5,PmonX,4,Sat Jul 18 05:58:34 2015 UTC,"You know what rewards fast reflexes? Leaving before the mine fucking arms. There's plenty of time to escape safely and if you can't make it out, then you can just deal with being dead.   What you're suggesting would nerf mines making them shit, and they're already so easy to counter.   This is not an issue in DB. There is absolutely nothign wrong with mines dealing full damage when shot because arming them doesn't suddenly make them go from not-explosive to explosive.  Buck up and deal with it."
Dirtybomb,3dpne5,Nalrus,2,Sat Jul 18 06:37:48 2015 UTC,"Why do people get so hostile at simple suggestions. I just saw your flair in another thread and you seemed pretty chill there.   To your point I'll say: a proxy running in and dropping a mine forces you to deal with her or the mine. Either you retreat and try to kill her while doing so, giving up the site you were holding in the process, or you kill her fast enough and retreat. Both scenarios kinda reward reckless proxy play.   I'd suggest decreasing the arm time but making them safe to shoot before they are fully armed."
Dirtybomb,3dpne5,TaskEvasion,3,Sat Jul 18 07:06:39 2015 UTC,"Why do people assume everyone is hostile?  Swearing =/= hostility.   This is a total non-issue and I see a lot of threads on it.

Dirtybomb,3dpne5,Nalrus,2,Sat Jul 18 09:18:24 2015 UTC,Proxy is a scout class her whole build is about being reckless.
Dirtybomb,3dpne5,lolmagic1,2,Sat Jul 18 07:50:54 2015 UTC,"I disagree. Its about being mobile and  having the awareness to be where you can be most effective. That's not reckless in my opinion, that's strategic and clever. Running in and dropping mine on an objective, dying and getting two kills, is not. IMO."
Dirtybomb,3dpne5,TaskEvasion,1 point,Sat Jul 18 08:09:36 2015 UTC,So i can't do that and be reckless just playing the class is reckless everything can one shot you.
Dirtybomb,3dpne5,lolmagic1,1 point,Sat Jul 18 08:16:07 2015 UTC,So this makes it ok to allow proxy to be a suicide bomber...its bad enough that nader can do this  All my suggestion does is give someone who is paying attention and fast to react a chance to not auto die when a proxy drops a mine that more often than not gets hidden by her falling corpse
Dirtybomb,3dpne5,lolmagic1,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:33:33 2015 UTC,Maybe shoot the dead body cause most proxy's like hiding in body's.
Dirtybomb,3dpne5,JustiniZHere,2,Sun Jul 19 04:11:29 2015 UTC,"Yup, I found a Proxy main who does not want their cheese removed. Face it the fact you can run through a group of people and throw down mines is almost a guaranteed 2-3 kills maybe more. You CAN'T deal with them in a way that does not kill everyone quick thinking or no.   Everything has to have counterplay and as it stands the only real counterplay for proxy mines used in that way is A run away and let your team die and gib or B shoot it and kill your teammates. Being able to shoot mines before they arm should destroy them with no explosion, it's the proxys fault for putting down mines in peoples faces and it's not a nerf to mines as how often are people going to shoot mines before they arm?"

Dirtybomb,3dpne5,TeaL3af,2,Sat Jul 18 07:25:23 2015 UTC,"For this to work we'd have to be able to remove mines without them going off somehow, using the defuse tool to disarm them seems fair."

The entry fee for the teams also concerns me. The game is still in a very early stage, especially competition-wise, and I don't think its entirely ready for any sort of 'PRO LEAGUE'. This is even more concerning when the total prize pool ($600) is less than the amount attained from the teams ($800) unless I'm not factoring in some additional prizing.  Regardless, the growth within the Dirty Bomb competitive scene has been absolutely incredible. It's exciting to see the Australian scene be a part of this immense growth."

Dirtybomb,3dn7pp,NxA_MissMurder,2,Fri Jul 17 17:53:45 2015 UTC,"Another benefit of ""wait it out"" is that you get closer to when he'll be in free-rotation, so that you can try-before-you-buy."

Dirtybomb,3dn7pp,slider2k,-4,Fri Jul 17 20:41:04 2015 UTC,"will buyers be able to trade the merc for another one if you nerf him to oblivion?  Because that doesn't sound very fair: - buy a good merc for a lot of money, wait 2 weeks and he is useless. I would also strongly recommend to look further into it, because since the last week he doesn't seem to be OP at all. Sure, at first he mowed through groups of enemies, but people get more aware now that he is going around with his knife."
Dirtybomb,3dn7pp,mephisto1990,3,Fri Jul 17 20:33:30 2015 UTC,It was never a smart idea to purchase a merc based off their state of balance anyways. Buy mercs you enjoy not the ones that seem strong at the time.
Dirtybomb,3dn7pp,Alphadef,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:31:43 2015 UTC,"But if they go heavy with the nurfbat, that could really cut into enjoyment. I bought him because he seemed like he'd be fun, but if they hit him so hard he is completely useless, or has a completely different playstyle, I think it's a fair question to ask. They don't have to do cash refunds, I think refunding for the 50k credits would be pretty fair for everyone. Honestly I'll probably keep him no matter what, but it seems like something that would be worth considering."
Dirtybomb,3dn7pp,morgrath,2,Sat Jul 18 04:28:08 2015 UTC,But they could easily say you should have waited for free rotation.
Dirtybomb,3dn7pp,Artersa,1 point,Sat Jul 18 06:36:55 2015 UTC,"True true, I bought him for the playstyle as well. Only time will tell."
Dirtybomb,3dn7pp,Alphadef,7,Sat Jul 18 13:45:04 2015 UTC,rhino vs. phantom really just comes down to which play style interests you more:   you like being the sneaky assassin type? get phantom like being the big ass anchor in a group more or less leading the charge or defensive push? get rhino   though when it comes to phantom in particular there's 2 things that should be mentioned:   it's extremely likely he's getting some changes in the near future (very likely people will go for blood on SD if he doesn't based off overall opinions of him) seems currently phantom is heavily banking on people not really knowing how to deal with him to really be effective leaving him kinda hit or miss when used in game (i've had games where i dominated in min lvl 10 servers with him but then turn around and bottom scored and pretty much never getting a kill)   TL;DR:  up to your preference of play style between the 2  but between the 2 rhino is the overall safer pick since phantom could see huge sweeping changes in the future heavily changing his playstyle and overall rhino is far more team/objective friendly (which is kinda important since objectives usually win games not kills)
Dirtybomb,3dn7pp,sic2k10,2,Fri Jul 17 17:56:57 2015 UTC,"Rhino is far more beneficial to the team. Rhino can tank bullets, distract the entire team and do lots of damage. Phantom can only tank a few bullets, distract a few players and do damage to only one at a time. Phantom is technically a recon class, but not really yet. Give it time before you buy phantom unless you really want easy kills"
Dirtybomb,3dn7pp,Epic_Wink,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:10:13 2015 UTC,"Here's hoping they emphasis the recon part of him.  I am perfectly fine with him filling an ""assassin"" role, he just needs something like a spotting ping around him while cloaked, this would obviously need to be in addition to a reduction in frontal assault.  I am a fan of keeping his sword leathal but less bs swing around crazy as well as some tuning to his shield and possibly changing the primaries he has assess to (like having to choose pistols + katana or smg + normal knife)."
Dirtybomb,3dn7pp,Duranous,2,Fri Jul 17 19:56:04 2015 UTC,"You just made me think of a solution. Phantom would be neat if stealthy facing a target, tanky and shadowy running away on the backside? Lol"
Dirtybomb,3dn7pp,Sardonislamir,2,Fri Jul 17 20:04:59 2015 UTC,"No info on the next merc yet, popular opinion is that it'll be either RedEye or Stoker(though it could be neither). Furthermore, the dev stream commentary indicated it will be ""some time"" before the next merc is released still.  To answer your initial question, I would say yes, he is still worth buying, with the understanding that his playstyle will change some time in the near future. It may be altered several times, even - the same with all mercs, as this is open beta.  I would recommend Rhino over Phantom, however. I purchased Rhino last night, and put both him and Phantom in my loadout. Played a few matches on Chapel, and as attacker, Rhino was able to push into the final objective better than Phantom. I racked up more points with Phantom due to the melee kill boosts, but Rhino was overall more effective at progressing the match. Plus, it was more fun just eating bullets and overpowering enemy mercs rather than sneaking around trying to get stealth kills."
Dirtybomb,3dn7pp,FailingItUp,3,Fri Jul 17 17:26:35 2015 UTC,"I'd also like to point out that if you're decent at sneaking a Rhino can absolutely dominate the enemy team. There have been multiple times where I'd sneak to the back line as Rhino, kill all the long range characters and then move forward to slaughter the front line characters from behind, allowing my allies to push forward in a giant wave and take the objective. He's also a great counter to an enemy team with very good Phantoms.   I'd personally recommend Rhino for his ability to move a match forward, he's difficult to position but he can be the spearhead in a lot of amazing plays."
Dirtybomb,3dn7pp,SowakaWaka,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:14:32 2015 UTC,"If we assume the E3 video cast represents developer plans, then Phoenix or ""Turtle"" are probably on the horizon.  That said, I'm personally hoping for Redeye because he adds an interesting Vassili/Phantom counter, and because we're currently short on covert-ops mercs."
Dirtybomb,3dn7pp,Terr_,2,Fri Jul 17 19:28:43 2015 UTC,"Turtle would make sense; he will be an engineer from my understanding, and his shield ability could need tweaking since he'll likely change the overall game dynamic.  Although Phoenix got his nameplate shown, so more likely to be him."
Dirtybomb,3dn7pp,FailingItUp,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:54:31 2015 UTC,"If I were to go off the trailer I would have though Phantom would have a pisol :(  as for Kira, maybe she switched to brs after getting her laser (which kind of conflicts with her bio, but who cares maybe she had inside info on its transportation route and it wasn't simply this is cool I think I'll take it)."

Between rhino and phantom its much easier to get a great k/d with phantom. you may not get number one in the leaderboards but its really hard not to get best k/d with him. That said, i enjoy rhino a lot more. Get the spin up perk for him if you do get him."

After that the game uses up to 2.8 GB memory which is perfectly fine and even after a dozen games it won't slow down at all. So your issue is not universal which means it probably not that high on their list of things to fix. I have a 3570k/780Ti/SSD.

And others reported that it fixed framerate drops when swapping weapon for the first time and such.  Basically texture streaming tries to use less memory while constantly reloading stuff in the background from HDD/SSD and disabling it loads everything into the memory which is faster.

Dirtybomb,3djras,AMasonJar,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:19:05 2015 UTC,I don't think that is a viable option because you say to everyone if you die die on an objective so we can do both and because you can't choose were to die (precisely otherwise you are just suiciding) you give a bonus to a somewhat rng moment (which is not something you want in your game).
Dirtybomb,3djras,XohleT,7,Thu Jul 16 23:15:32 2015 UTC,"you give a bonus   Already answered in link:   Sure, it may seem like an undeserved bonus (especially for defenders on the C4) but the important thing is that it removes the frustration without requiring specialized binds for rare situations."
Dirtybomb,3djras,Terr_,-2,Thu Jul 16 23:21:23 2015 UTC,I don't think giving a bonus because players can't press another button is the right way to go. Because in the competitive scene any undeserved bonus is making the game less viable for esports.

Dirtybomb,3djras,Terr_,22,Fri Jul 17 22:40:37 2015 UTC,It isn't as straight forward as you think.   If you aren't an engineer and the bomb isn't going to explode in a while reviving the person on the bomb (if he is an engineer) is the best option. I  f the person on the bomb is an engineer but the bomb is almost defused defusing is more important.   I think splash damage should incorporate a way to change the available options (Like pressing v changes the option from defusing to reviving and so on and so forth).
Dirtybomb,3djras,XohleT,11,Thu Jul 16 21:20:23 2015 UTC,or personal preference in the options. Its so annoying
Dirtybomb,3djras,Jessy0701x,3,Thu Jul 16 21:28:37 2015 UTC,I think there isn't something as personal preference because depending in the precise situation the best option is different.
Dirtybomb,3djras,XohleT,15,Thu Jul 16 21:44:21 2015 UTC,Imo adding 'G' as a secondary context action would be ideal. Even more ideal would be setting up priority of keys prompts.
Dirtybomb,3djras,MrChuckles20,17,Thu Jul 16 22:16:57 2015 UTC,The keyboard has enoug space for dedicated key.   F:  context key G: defuse key H: help up key   everything should be rebindable ofcourse.

Dirtybomb,3djras,Terr_,7,Fri Jul 17 23:40:08 2015 UTC,"I think giving priority to the C4 is the easiest way to allow for all situations.  A body is much bigger than the C4. If the C4 is right under their chest, revive their legs, since the C4 hitbox is pretty small."
Dirtybomb,3djras,KStu82,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:42:58 2015 UTC,I think the secondary context action idea /u/MrChuckles20 mentioned is a better option as it covers every problem you can have with multiple interactions on one point.
Dirtybomb,3djras,XohleT,5,Thu Jul 16 23:18:23 2015 UTC,We make quick math. Bomb defuse for a non engineer class = 8 seconds. Revive = 5 seconds defuse for an engineer 4 seconds.. so 9 seconds for a revived engineer to defuse while a non engineer class would do it in 8
Dirtybomb,3djras,CORUSC4TE,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:38:42 2015 UTC,So you say that no matter what class you are just straight up defusing is faster. Didn't know that but have you thought about wanting to revive a medic near a defused bomb so that you have better protection. Plus I still think that reviving a engineer near a bomb is still the better option because then you have 2 people near the objective and have better foothold to defuse 1s extra doesn't really outweighs that imo.
Dirtybomb,3djras,XohleT,2,Fri Jul 17 01:04:14 2015 UTC,im assuming 5v5s at all time since its the only mode im really playing.   When the engineer dies he mostly have medic on his side. You wont have 5 seconds in a fire fight to help up an engineer or a medic. If both medics go down AND the engineer goes down you are screwd and u should go for the kills to clear the side for the next spawn and get some time on the bomb as long as u can. There is no chance of u getting an engineer up while the bomb is beeing defended by the enemy and if u killed them all the spawn time will be likely to hit 0 in some seconds and it doesnt really matter so get time on the bomb and prepare it for the engineer.
Dirtybomb,3djras,CORUSC4TE,1 point,Fri Jul 17 10:09:23 2015 UTC,There is never always one way to go in a game and I don't think you should force a players choice but instead let the player decide what he wants.

Dirtybomb,3djras,acousticdank,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:32:41 2015 UTC,"So you say that no matter what class you are just straight up defusing is faster.    In almost all situations, yes. Just because there are obscure exceptions doesn't mean bodies should prevent you from defusing the bomb."

Dirtybomb,3djras,XohleT,2,Fri Jul 17 09:07:07 2015 UTC,"Not really, reviving the engineer and letting him defuse it takes just as long (if not longer) than defusing it as any other class."
Dirtybomb,3djras,infamousNL,2,Fri Jul 17 06:58:49 2015 UTC,"They could just make it so if the C4 is close to your crosshair in screen space it takes precedence. So if a dude is dead on the C4, looking directly at the C4 through his corpse will start defusing but looking at a part of the body not blocking the C4 will start helping up."
Dirtybomb,3djras,TeaL3af,2,Fri Jul 17 07:06:59 2015 UTC,"If you aren't an engineer and the bomb isn't going to explode in a while reviving the person on the bomb (if he is an engineer) is the best option. I   In theory this might be correct, but because disarms are cumulative I think it's better for even a slow class to attempt a disarm.  Even if you manage to only disarm 10%, it's better than managing a 99% revive and dying."
Dirtybomb,3djras,acousticdank,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:31:24 2015 UTC,That's why I think an option is the way to go on this. We both think differently about the best way to go and we need both of us to be able to take our best option.

Dirtybomb,3dptmm,Kapoweazel,2,Sat Jul 18 07:23:00 2015 UTC,That sounds like a completely awful balance idea. Considering the katana is his melee weapon that would not work.
Dirtybomb,3dptmm,JustiniZHere,1 point,Sat Jul 18 07:36:04 2015 UTC,"Actually I think it would be a good idea if he still had his normal melee (knife, bat ect.) but he had his katana as another ability as a 1 use only 1 hit kill that recharge every minute or so."
Dirtybomb,3dptmm,DrrProff,1 point,Sat Jul 18 07:45:45 2015 UTC,"Problem with that is Phantom would be useless for the duration his Katana is down, once they (if they) ever nerf the kek10 and his Katana has a 30-40~ second cooldown he would not even be worth playing.  I've used a Phantom loadout without the Katana before and let me tell you it's fucking awful. Completely useless waste of space."
Dirtybomb,3dptmm,JustiniZHere,0,Sat Jul 18 07:52:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah, have the katana be a seperate weapon and maybe have a duration of 5-7 seconds that he can use it for."
Dirtybomb,3dptmm,akdrag,1 point,Sat Jul 18 08:34:49 2015 UTC,Or katana can be made a activatable melee weapons like those faction specific blades in Planetside 2 which have a timer on it.(normal mellee with no active)

Dirtybomb,3dmpdo,pnellesen,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:33:24 2015 UTC,"Because the average pubbie is god-awful at the game. Especially on sub level 10 servers.

Dirtybomb,3dmpdo,gaulitz,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:03:12 2015 UTC,Because theoretically the other team can also go 5 phantoms and a proxy. Just because of one bad match up doesn't mean they have to change the game around it.

At least we are able to test execution game modes and new unbalanced mercs with bad aimpunch and no auto team function while private servers are still in the process of being made. RIP DB soonTM.

Dirtybomb,3dky16,shkyy,1 point,Fri Jul 17 04:04:10 2015 UTC,"They mark the ticket as ""solved"" because after the report comes in they investigate and take action if there is solid enough evidence. ""Solved"" in this case means that they've done all they can do- they can't report back to the person who reported the cheater saying ""Ok we banned this person/we didn't ban this person"" because then it becomes a privacy issue."

Dirtybomb,3dky16,gronmin,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:11:27 2015 UTC,"While you are here I'll ask a question I have been wondering,  are you guys planning on upgrading the report system?  Cause right now either someone can make their profile private, or you can't get evidence either because you don't have recording software or you aren't able to spectate them like in competitive mode for example. I played a game where a skyhammer killed 2 people on our team in about a second with the 3 shot burst gun almost immediately and then did the same with the rest of our team. This lead to them spawn camping us with in the first minute of the match and since we couldn't spectate him or see his steam profile we weren't able to report him. So we had to sit there and wait for the game to finish,  wait for someone to leave or suffer a leaver penalty. Me and my friends immediately stopped playing after that game and I'm not sure we are going to end up playing competitive again as a result."
Dirtybomb,3dky16,Exayex,2,Fri Jul 17 17:03:35 2015 UTC,"From what I've seen, they are working on both a report system and a new antihack.  I can tell you from experience with Nosgoth, antihack takes time to implement.  There's usually a long data gathering phase before anything can even happen."
Dirtybomb,3dky16,TwoThreeSkidoo,7,Fri Jul 17 18:37:32 2015 UTC,"Often times in tech support the reps will mark the ticket as solved, rather than pending, because their bosses will give them shit for having too many pending cases open. It's not as shitty as it sounds, because as soon as you (or anyone else internally) respond in someway the ticket is reopened under their name. Also, they could have passed it onto another team and done the same. Then if there are any updates it would be reopened.  Basically it's a way of circumventing the slave labor like KPIs passed down by management that were probably recommended by MBAs at BCG."

Dirtybomb,3dky16,Tarqon,16,Fri Jul 17 17:37:22 2015 UTC,"Addendum: part of this problem could be more easily circumvented if the ""view players"" and/or ""view recent players"" options from Steam actually worked in this game: one of these cheaters had a generic anime name, and so I couldn't directly find their profile because a search turned up -literally- thousands of matches. And believe me, I looked in the first  few pages and found NOTHING. So, basically, one can't even find the profile of the obvious cheater if they are aware of this.  Nexon/SD really needs to put almost everything else aside to help players deal with this, report effectively, and in turn, help Nexon/SD itself. A ""report"" feature would instantly provide them the name, steam profile, server name, time of the day, etc etc etc basically EVERYTHING they ask for in their ""report abuse"" form in a split second, automatically, without no need for manual player input. (I took the time to fill every single bit of info they asked in a clear and concise manner, with screenshots and steam profile links. I'd assume that I'm the exception here and that most people don't bother with most of these.  SD, if you want us to spend money on your game -and I want to- you have to do something about this. If people with a brand new account, who haven't even spent the minimum 5 USD in it -what is required by Valve to access many of Steam's basic functionalities- can play this game, then we're in for wave after wave of hackers who will simply be able to come back. That is, if they're banned in the first place.  And there's nothing left for us to do if we can't host our own servers. I'd GLADLY pay for one out of my own pocket if it gave me control over who could play in it.  EDIT: Edited for grammar, consistency and formatting"
Dirtybomb,3dky16,mitsuhiko,4,Fri Jul 17 03:28:48 2015 UTC,"Oddly enough right click > view steam profile works for friends on the main menu, so they have the functionality, just not implemented on the scoreboard."

In casual matches, of which I have thousands of matches... I have run into maybe 2.

Dirtybomb,3dky16,SolarBear,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:55:31 2015 UTC,"Hey,  Looking at the logs it seems like they was temporarily banned for a few days, this is usually the case when XIGNCODE detects potentially 'dodgy' third-party programs but not explicit DB/UE3 cheats.   Were you able to provide any video evidence against the player? The accuracy stats aren't anything special so without additional evidence he likely wont be receiving a permaban right now.  We're currently working hard toward introducing better anti-cheat solutions in the future. We don't want to rush them out without proper testing due to the possibility of impacting legitimate players. Other plans include better Player Reporting systems and automated flagging of accounts when players peak over certain statistical thresholds.  I know it's not ideal right now but the best way to get a ban to stick is with video evidence"

Dirtybomb,3dmb9p,Terr_,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:30:51 2015 UTC,"It would not only look cool, it would require skill to catch it again. Also the time until it's down again would only be seconds.

Dirtybomb,3dmb9p,AMasonJar,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:25:07 2015 UTC,"it would require skill    Not necessarily, no. You could have a simple bind/macro to do things like:   Throw forward so that you'll automatically re-catch it as long as you didn't deviate too far from running in a straight line.  As above, but also auto-spam medical/ammo-packs into your own path. Throw it straight upwards, allowing you to stop and defib a teammate, deploy a mine/turret, or even take a quick sniper shot.   All of those scenarios would be ""just push a button"" ways of exploiting the mechanic to reduce the intended ""cost"" to your team of moving the objective."

The fire rate is a lot less, so if you are used to the kek-10 for example or the hochfire you might miss some bullets I guess. The blishlock is good when your track improves, otherwise stick to shotguns and SMG's etc. All I'm saying is that the gun will get better over time ;) And I prefer to have a decent weapon for distance anyway."
Dirtybomb,3dlvp2,infamousNL,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:46:53 2015 UTC,"I actually prefer Crotzni and SMG-9 over the KEK-10 when it comes to SMGs.  I think my tracking is alright, although obviously there's always room to improve. With the Blishlok my primary issue was hitting fast-moving targets up close, because obviously they're the hardest to track. In fact I ended up swapping it for the SMG-9 primarily because the faster fire rate of the SMG-9 felt like it was better for killing Phantoms, which are plentiful on pubs.  Blishlok feels like a nod to Enemy Territory's Thompson and MP-40, actually. I believe the fire rate is identical to them, and the damage is also more comparable. It may be a much better gun than people are giving it credit for, I've seen people call it the worst SMG. It feels reasonably accurate from the hip and has very high damage."

Check out the comparison of high versus low graphics in terms of how visible Phantom is.    It really does not look that bad to me.   Make sure you compare both pictures at their real native zoom-level (they're 1920x1080) because resizing them down blurs the revealing details of Phantom, leaving you with only the brightness-boundary to look at. The key difference seems to be the brightness of the wall which happens to be behind him, not the Phantom himself, who seems very similar in both shots. Phantom is just easier to see on lighter backgrounds. If you can find a place where low-graphics makes the background darker, and I think that'll be a place where Phantom becomes harder to see."

I actually see very little difference when I view them both at full-size. When you shrink the pictures, all of Phantom's pixel-details get blurred, leaving the light/dark contrast as the main thing to notice. So for these particular pictures, the real difference isn't how Phantom looks, but the specific color of that wall, which is lighter since shadows are not being cast on it, making it easier to see a smoky cloak.   I'm willing to bet that if you find a place where low-graphics makes a wall darker, then that's a place where low-graphics would make it harder to see him."

K, doesn't matter, I can spray him from 20 yards away and his cloak absorbs all the damage and he two shots me.  "" Aim for the head git gud scrub"" Again, his FUCKING CLOAK ABSORBS DAMAGE."
Dirtybomb,3dq6a8,PowerfulTaxMachine,4,Sat Jul 18 14:26:50 2015 UTC,"If a phantom starts following you, hold down the S key and hold/ tap M1 while aiming for the head.   Good luck if you're a slow character. Consider this scenario; You play as Skyhammer, enemy Phantom has used his cloak to sneak up on you (this is extremely easy as phantom) he hits you with a heavy attack in the back. You have now less that 1 second to turn around and shoot 120 damage on phantom before he hits you again with a light attack. That's literally impossible. It can be done as fragger but that's hard as well.    Correction: If ANY merc gets the drop on you you you're dead   This is so wrong. I very often turn around and kill my attacker when i'm ambushed. Maybe if the merc has a shotgun and he is 1 meter behind you. Shotgun mercs don't have cloak so they deserve that kill."
Dirtybomb,3dq6a8,Rusemaster1,-3,Sat Jul 18 12:44:26 2015 UTC,"Well, if he sneaked on you he deserves that kill...  The problem is people who tank mindlessly and get away with it."
Dirtybomb,3dq6a8,CaptainShaky,3,Sat Jul 18 13:59:01 2015 UTC,"No, he doesn't since he has a cloaking device. Sneaking is not even a challenge."
Dirtybomb,3dq6a8,Rusemaster1,0,Sat Jul 18 14:23:32 2015 UTC,... Are you kidding ?  What's the point of a cloaking device if not sneaking ?
Dirtybomb,3dq6a8,CaptainShaky,3,Sat Jul 18 14:27:22 2015 UTC,I'm saying that he doesn't even belong in this game.
Dirtybomb,3dq6a8,Rusemaster1,-1,Sat Jul 18 14:32:43 2015 UTC,"That's your opinion. The point of a cloak is still to sneak.  PS: To those downvoting me, please read the rediquette and stop being douchebags."
Dirtybomb,3dq6a8,CaptainShaky,3,Sat Jul 18 14:57:26 2015 UTC,Why would you need to sneak when you are invisible?
Dirtybomb,3dq6a8,Rusemaster1,8,Sat Jul 18 15:43:40 2015 UTC,"If you want to understand why he's truly broken, think about the variety of things your character can do. Phantom is fast, surprisingly so. He goes invisible so logic dictates that he's going to have to sneak around right? Not so if he can pop his ""stealth"", and shear through all your bullets to get right up close and give his signature katana kiss.  ""Shoot him and backpedal"" Unless you're literally cheating to rail every single shot into his head at usually extremely close range, he's just not going down, the ""stealth"" shield takes most of your shots and then you die, the only way to prevent this is shoot the shield more to deplete his energy. The only success I've had back-pedaling is with shotgun headshots, and even that is rare (as in the phantom was already injured).  You may have some amazing talent for seeing the slight blur that is Phantom in the middle of the firefight, but I don't, most people don't. Before you see the distortion he's literally less than 10 feet from you, so you better headshot and fast or he's got you. (this is not true of any other mercs)  Finally there's a macro people can use that allows them to spin incredibly quickly, which would normally just be silly and useless, but thanks the ability to drag your hits with the katana, you can swing it through an infinite number of targets in a single swing.  In every sense, as the game is right now, Phantom is horrifically broken. He doesn't have any of the drawbacks a stealth character has, he's a scrappy brawler with powerful offences at both close and medium/long range, which in itself is a character, and for his special he gets a stealth ability. Right there, that's broken. Now throw on top that his stealth ability absorbs damage. That's insanely broken. Now throw on top of that his one shotting multiple people with a single melee attack, are we even serious anymore? The competitive players may be able to form entire strats and team compositions to counter him, but as far as everyone else goes, he's a pubstomping cancerous growth.  Before I'm even going to consider him not being horrifically broken, I'm going to need someone to point out a downside to using him. ""He doesn't have a sniper rifle"" doesn't count."

Dirtybomb,3dnb2q,ret3p,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:48:51 2015 UTC,So it's only available for competitive?
Dirtybomb,3dnb2q,KStu82,2,Fri Jul 17 18:05:12 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, although it does make sense.  In competitive, the game matches people that are all queued at the same time, and you always start a game from the beginning, so it's a lot easier to get groups of 2+ players in the same server on the same team.  In pubs, it's a lot more finicky, even for 2 people. In order for 2 people to join a pub on the same team, they need to join a team with at least 1 less person than their opponents, but at least 2 away from the team maximum.  It gets significantly more rare to find adequate servers as the party size increases. For instance, with a 4 player party, even joining an 8v8 server, one team would need to have at least 3 less players than their opponents, and it would have to be at most 4v7, 5v8 wouldn't allow the 4th player in.  That being said, I think it would work for a party system to send the group into a game on different teams, wherever they fit, but once they get back to a lobby and autobalance the teams, the party could stay together from that point on...until one of them gets a case and leaves the lobby to open it (which should also be changed, but that's a whole different topic)."

Dirtybomb,3dlo5h,BeardyDuck,0,Fri Jul 17 10:46:24 2015 UTC,"Depends. There are 3 missions every 3 hours that nets you anywhere from 750-3000 credits. A single game from start to finish nets you around ~250 credits. So in theory, 50k credits can be acquired in as short a time as ~15 hours (Because missions refresh every 3 hours, it's more realistically ~6-7 hours of playtime.)"

Dirtybomb,3dnwe3,SmokeDayEveryWeed,3,Fri Jul 17 20:27:57 2015 UTC,"Shes fine at the moment, possibly a slight buff to direct hitting with the medpacks cause its quite hard to hit with. Shes a high risk, high skill cap character. Learning how to use the Revivr effectively at all ranges is the key and knowing when to switch to your machine pistol as well."
Dirtybomb,3dnwe3,vampwood,-2,Fri Jul 17 20:40:21 2015 UTC,"Ranged revive sounds a lot better than it is. If someone dies far up on the front line, reviving them is more than likely just going to get them killed again. As it stands currently she cant heal a rhino to full if she uses all her medipacks. I think they medpacks should get a hot component like sawbones."
Dirtybomb,3dnwe3,vampwood,5,Fri Jul 17 21:41:45 2015 UTC,She heals via her revivr without having to risk her self as much to do so. The medkits are mostly for herself now. She really shines in being able to delete someone with headshots and at mid range with cover poke someone down quickly with multi headshots from quick charges. You have to have very solid aiming to make her worthwhile at all. Not many players have that and sawbonez is still the better pick most of the time. Shes fine as a more niche pick.
Dirtybomb,3dnwe3,slider2k,3,Fri Jul 17 21:56:25 2015 UTC,"I personally feel a reasonable buff would be to give her a main weapon smg and give the medic packs a hot effect like sawbones.   If you want a combat oriented medic, why don't you play Sawbonez then? I'd rather not give her offensive buffs, but make her Revive Gun also heal allies on hit."
Dirtybomb,3dnwe3,AMasonJar,-1,Fri Jul 17 20:46:35 2015 UTC,"This is an fps not an mmo, every medic is a hybrid. Maybe she works better in competitive play where people know im going to revive them, and adjust their play accordingly."

Dirtybomb,3dnwe3,Schoolgirls_,2,Sat Jul 18 00:09:20 2015 UTC,"The one thing that I would like to see is a two-click system for her Revive gun. One click to start charging, a second click to fire.

Dirtybomb,3dnwe3,AMasonJar,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:55:44 2015 UTC,I like having the Tolin as a main with a pistol for back up and as for her health packs we'll have to wait and see how they made potent packs work for her since they said they've fixed the broken perks.

Dirtybomb,3dnwe3,SC2_Bench,5,Fri Jul 17 21:09:07 2015 UTC,"More play than aura, not Sawbonez. Sawbonez is still the reliable, powerful medic whereas aura and sparks are different, niche mercs"

Dirtybomb,3dnwe3,Schoolgirls_,0,Fri Jul 17 22:01:35 2015 UTC,"The obj damage is going to be patched, isn't it? Then Sparks is underwhelming a bit. Not bad, but not as good as Sawbonez. She needs a slight buff to her medpacks."

Dirtybomb,3dklcl,OWLpus42,7,Fri Jul 17 00:54:58 2015 UTC,"Worst part is that since they aren't even required to spend cash on steam in any shape way or form to play DB, they'll be perfectly able to just get a smurf account after they are banned and do this all over again."

Credit Card on record could be one way to be ""verified"".  I've suggested this in several F2P games I've played where griefers run rampant because they can just remake account."

If you registered your credit card on an account that got banned, you can't register a new account with same credit card.  The verification process can only be used once, so whatever you use to verify with, can only be used to make one account.  Get banned, and you can't make a new verified account."

Dirtybomb,3do3b7,Hutchythesmall,4,Fri Jul 17 21:20:21 2015 UTC,"I like Stopwatch, because it feels like people know what to do most of the time and it feels like everyone is working harder to win. Like in objective there can be one sided matches or you have a team full of K/D worshippers (no offense, but a few really don't get what an objective shooter is about...). It's the race against the clock that makes it more challenging and rewarding if you beat the enemy by a few seconds"
Dirtybomb,3do3b7,Thormon,3,Fri Jul 17 21:37:08 2015 UTC,"I love stopwatch mode. Objective mode is too chaotic and non-objective driven. People generally ignore the objective and just do whatever they want. In stopwatch people tend to work together much more.  Sure, I've seen matches that are completely one sided (a team runs through the objectives as fast as they can and the only thing slowing them down is travel time between goals), but I've played many more matches where the game is very close."
Dirtybomb,3do3b7,typodaemon,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:28:04 2015 UTC,"Very rarely have I played a close stopwatch game in pubs.

Dirtybomb,3do3b7,fireoftheabyss,3,Fri Jul 17 22:22:05 2015 UTC,"I like Stopwatch because what side you're on matters less. Underground has a slight attacker advantage and all other maps have a defender advantage. Because both teams play both sides, those map advantages don't matter as much."

I've never been a fan of the competitive format of, say, CS for example. I far prefer the way Dirty Bomb, Brink, ET, QW, etc. work.   The only thing that feels better than full-holding a team on defense that you know is good is beating a time that they set by a margin of seconds while on offense. There's nothing like the adrenaline rush you get when you know you're on the last spawn of the round and you have to secure the objective now or it's game over."
Dirtybomb,3do3b7,atm0,2,Fri Jul 17 22:16:47 2015 UTC,There's nothing like the adrenaline rush you get when you know you're on the last spawn of the round and you have to secure the objective now or it's game over.   You can get that in objective too...
Dirtybomb,3do3b7,Nalrus,2,Sat Jul 18 05:20:58 2015 UTC,Once I hit level 10 and can play lvl10+ servers then I'll probably play more stopwatch. I've had some really great matches in stopwatch but I've also had my worst matches in stopwatch. People play like it's team death match half the time and ignore objectives which can be okay in objective mode as long as you eventually complete the objective but in stopwatch it will kill your time and lose you the game.
Dirtybomb,3do3b7,inuizzy,2,Fri Jul 17 22:34:44 2015 UTC,Too many times I've played obj. and my team has put up a really great defense but the other team just barely completes the objective in time.

This may account for the times when you obviously don't land the sticky on somebodies feet, but it disappears anyways.   This may be due to the way projectiles are handled by the server, and may be an effect of lag-compensation. Hitscan weapons sometimes have a noticeably nonsensical effect on whoever gets hit, but projectiles like stickies, nades and frag grenades I feel have more problems when they're launched, striking walls that they should have cleared, etc.  Obviously the things disappearing is a bug specific to stickies, but them not sticking in the first place may be due to lag compensation."

TL;DR: The trailer is absolutely no indication of actual in-game features and mechanics, it's just a CG trailer for marketing purposes.   As for the damage, yes of course it was intentional that he does the amount of damage that he does with the Katana. And that's perfectly fine.

Dirtybomb,3djfxj,dustymarshmallow,4,Thu Jul 16 20:28:52 2015 UTC,95 - 98% since only 2 - 5% of all players drop a dime on F2P games.
Dirtybomb,3djfxj,PapstJL4U,0,Thu Jul 16 21:41:48 2015 UTC,There really is no other way other than private tournaments. There is no anti-cheat that can stop people from hacking when a game is F2P. Literally create another acount and hack away. The level-requirement that exists is not enough. Either change it to an absurd level like 15-20 or else it will take just minutes to get inside again. At least a buy-in would make most cheaters give another thought.

Dirtybomb,3dlewr,BeardyDuck,2,Fri Jul 17 06:31:29 2015 UTC,"Depends on the version of UE3. UE3 before ~2011 was strictly dx9.  It's why Red Orchestra 2 runs on dx9, because Tripwire used the 2006 UE3 SDK."

There were short alpha tests before then but those aren't betas those are alphas.  Edit: Here is a blog post from december 2012 where they are talking about how the build is currently even pre-alpha. So with this information in hand this leads me to believe that the game was definitely in development after 2011.   They also mention 'around a year ago just before we started work on dirty bomb' which leads me to believe they started development in 2012."

Dirtybomb,3dltsp,xZneak,3,Fri Jul 17 09:18:00 2015 UTC,"It really depends on where the team is at and whether you trust them or not. If i'm playing solo, I will suicide quite regularly to make sure there are no sneaky fuckers going straight for the objective (Happens all the time when no-one communicates). On the attacking side, it's always better to push as 5, so even if you aren't in a vulnerable position, resetting into a 5-man split push can be extremely advantageous!"
Dirtybomb,3dltsp,kqr,1 point,Fri Jul 17 09:46:32 2015 UTC,But why not just hang back in a safe place and wait for your team instead of kill yourself?
Dirtybomb,3dltsp,kqr,1 point,Fri Jul 17 10:25:38 2015 UTC,"Even though it's pub, in which I rarely play, as you can see after I pushed and killed those 2 under escalators, we actually regained full control so they didn't receive the forward spawn. If I hadn't have done that, it could have gone either way -    I sit back on site and give them full control of escalators, giving them them the all important forward spawn I die after timer and i'm down for 20 seconds while I watch my teammates lose the objective (80% of the time) ahah.   When you want to repair the EV for example and there is 10 seconds left on the spwan timer, you want your team-mates to push the opponents as far away off the EV as possible so that you control the area (and they cant use abilities to destroy it), once the spawn timer has around 1 - 3 seconds remaining, pressing K simply means they can't regain control by having 2 or 3 team mates down for 15+ seconds.   Appreciate the reply and I hope I made myself a little more clear :)"
Dirtybomb,3dltsp,kqr,2,Fri Jul 17 11:13:23 2015 UTC,"I'm still not sure I follow. Are you concerned the enemy will reach your teammates as they spawn before they have time to meet up with you?  You say if you hang back and wait for your teammates to push, the enemy will get full control of the escalators. Why would they not get that if you kill yourself and then run up to that point again?  Edit: I guess my confusion is: how is killing yourself different from hanging back in safety and regrouping with your team once they have spawned? It seems to me like both of those would have practically the same result. (Of course, hanging back in safety means there's a small risk you'll get killed – but there's also a small chance you'll be able to kill someone trying to flank your team, so it seems to me like they even each other out.)  Second edit: Either way, do more videos!! I learned a bunch of things from the ""5 things you might not know"" video and a bit from this one too!"
Dirtybomb,3dltsp,kqr,2,Fri Jul 17 11:16:19 2015 UTC,"I'm just going to copy and paste what I said to someone who had the same concerns on a forum :)  The more you play and learn from your mistakes, you will learn when the right time to suicide is.   Some could say I abandoned my teammates @ 2.04 but I would say I may have stopped a plant single handedly!   Look what happened after I suicided, both of my team mates who were next to me died to a FULL spawn timer, so instead of dying with them on a full timer and generously gifting them a plant on main site, I pushed them all the way back so they couldn't even get the forward spawn. Then I re-suicided so I would spawn with the whole team to re-engage as a unit to steal their forward spawn     Edit: Thanks for watching my videos and I will release a more in depth replay commentary in a couple of weeks with some 5man involvement in ranked/scrims"
Dirtybomb,3dltsp,gabbylee690,2,Fri Jul 17 11:36:20 2015 UTC,"Sure, the suicide at 2:04 makes a lot of sense to me because it's pretty much a quick way to teleport out of combat back to a better position to hold. The suicide at 2:28 I also understand: you were low on health and nowhere near cover, so there was a huge risk you'd die soon after the timer ticked over.  I don't understand why you should have suicided at 2:58! You were next to cover, enemies were at least a few seconds away from you, and you were just getting reinforcement from your team. Thanks to you staying alive, the guy trying to flank you got sniped. Had you respawned there, your team might have gotten flanked and you had lost control over that point.  Again at 3:24, instead of suiciding you stayed back within cover and managed to provide support for your team. To me, that seems much more valuable than teleporting back to spawn and doing very little to help the guys fighting on the front."
Dirtybomb,3dltsp,Spazit,2,Fri Jul 17 11:49:34 2015 UTC,"Look at our teams positioning, we are in their spawn! On both occasions it was the right move to not suicide, however decent players would have taken complete advantage of the fact that we are up in their grills, pushed us as 5, killed us all and taken control of the whole map! When i'm playing pub, I don't rely on my teammates to do everything, generally they don't know what they are doing (Being a new game), so if they were to wipe us and I was the only one alive, I would have played extremely smart, waited for the plant and killed him, without giving away my position prior to the plant."
Dirtybomb,3dltsp,Spazit,1 point,Fri Jul 17 11:55:55 2015 UTC,"Ahhh, thanks. I'm still new enough to the game where I'm not very good at the maps yet! I agree there's no reason at all to be in their spawn. Cheers!  Do I understand it correctly that you sort of view each 25 seconds (or whatever it is) as a short mini-round of Counter-Strike?"
Dirtybomb,3dltsp,gabbylee690,1 point,Fri Jul 17 12:40:08 2015 UTC,"hey just wanna ask a question. Is the spawn timer the same for both teams? For instance, if i see that its 4 seconds more to my next spawn, does this apply to them too?"

Dirtybomb,3dltsp,butchjiii,1 point,Fri Jul 17 12:48:22 2015 UTC,"I think what's more likely is I was ready for them to spawn but they spawned later because they didn't all press to spawn as soon as the counter hit 0.

Dirtybomb,3dm6ws,akdrag,9,Fri Jul 17 12:00:29 2015 UTC,"MOA is the best sniper, and you can have the ""Focus""-Perk wich reduces aimpunch and makes it easier when an enemy is shooting at you. The FEL-IX did 80 damage, so it was able to bodyshot some mercs, but they nerfed it down to 79. Its useless now in comparison to the MOA. Hardscope all the way, unless you are getting rushed. Then Quickscope. Weapons are laser hitscan, shots register instantly. See Nr.3, no lead. Play it like a CS:GO Scout where you can even hit accurately when moving left-right, also Jumpscout.   /edit: additional tips:   Throw your Motionballs aka ""Heart-Beat Sensors"" towards a chokepoint. They give spotted enemys Doritos over their head (like Battlefield), even through walls. Also makes phantom players a little more reluctant to push as it decloaks them. Headshots to get an entry, Bodyshots in a teamfight. Your teammates will greatly appreciate the additional damage over a possible miss. Positioning: Take a risk and move up. Dont be the first to push, but if you see your mates pushing, try to get some damage in. A lot of players view Vasilli-Players as useless for the team as most of them stay behind and snipe away. Dont be that Vasilli. Objectives. Most can be covered from a good defensive angle by Vasilli. Stay out of the direct action, but have a good view on for example the planted bomb. Headshot OBJ-based classes (engineers) once they kneel down to defuse for most profit."

It's quite possible DB caches the server list itself and re-queries the servers when refreshing though.  I suppose that cache could get stucks.

Dirtybomb,3dnn2o,KingMoonfish,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:10:40 2015 UTC,So how do you counter a merc that's completely invisible?  inb4 motion sensor
Dirtybomb,3dnn2o,Stuhlgewitter,0,Fri Jul 17 19:12:25 2015 UTC,"The heartbeat sensor/motion sensor, yeah. Mines, too.   Without the shield he'd only be able to gank lone wolves but I think that is one of his selling points."
Dirtybomb,3dnn2o,Stuhlgewitter,4,Fri Jul 17 19:15:02 2015 UTC,So a character that can only ever be counterplayed if a specific merc uses a specific ability at the right time in the right place is what you consider balanced?
Dirtybomb,3dnn2o,Terr_,-1,Fri Jul 17 19:17:11 2015 UTC,"It's not a ""specific merc"" doing a ""specific ability"", these are things that are done in every level, on every map. It certainly would be better than what we have now. If needed, you could make the duration of the cloak shorter so it has to be used intelligently."
Dirtybomb,3dnn2o,CORUSC4TE,0,Fri Jul 17 20:16:38 2015 UTC,"That's even worse:   Currently:   You see a Phantom-shape coming.  You shoot at it while backpedaling. Maybe you don't do enough damage. You get killed by a sword through the spine.  After your change:    You see nothing at all. You get killed by a sword through the spine.    If you want to fix Phantom's ability to use the cloak as a un-sneaky rusher, then he should lose attack-power if shot while cloaked."
Dirtybomb,3dnn2o,CORUSC4TE,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:43:29 2015 UTC,That's kind of what he does though. Right now he doesn't even need invisibility. He could be fully visible and still be overpowered.
Dirtybomb,3dnn2o,AMasonJar,0,Fri Jul 17 20:18:15 2015 UTC,I think its kind of ridiculous that the change u try to give phantom is making him like the spy out of team fortress and yet Valve decided to buff his invisibility with a shield! Isnt that kind of ironic?
Dirtybomb,3dnn2o,CORUSC4TE,3,Fri Jul 17 19:43:22 2015 UTC,Did the shield give him as much HP as the heavy? With a great close and mid-range weapon?
Dirtybomb,3dnn2o,AMasonJar,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:26:11 2015 UTC,The spy now survives while cloaked alot more than normal. He INSTASTABS EVERYTHING and he has a great headshot weapon. and he can disguise AS the enemy.
Dirtybomb,3dnn2o,CORUSC4TE,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:48:55 2015 UTC,"Disguises are almost useless. They're there to create doubt, not fool teams completely. Sure, he insta stabs everyone, but he has the lowest HP in the game and his headshots still only do 105 damage, after which you must wait to get another headshot or spray down anyone with low HP. Phantom has 120 HP and the best SMG in the game. Why?"
Dirtybomb,3dnn2o,D3athR3bel,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:22:59 2015 UTC,"Phantom is never invisible cant stay ""cloaked"" for long.   ""ONLY DOES 105 DAMAGE""? When im remembering correctly that 2 hits most classes!   Yeah disguising is useless but so is phantoms invisiblity. as soon as u are looking at him u spot him. Im not defending him he needs an overwork. but he is not as bad as people think he is. The Spy in TF2 has the abillity to stay invisible as long as he finds ammo or has the right equipment."
Dirtybomb,3dnn2o,AMasonJar,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:49:01 2015 UTC,"Phantom's invis isn't a problem, though, it's the fact that it absorbs damage that is. And sure, 105 damage two hits most classes, but once you get one shot in, they're probably aware of your presence and will try to dodge and retaliate."
Dirtybomb,3dnn2o,CORUSC4TE,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:00:38 2015 UTC,You just say how you get a phantom. some awareness and he is nothing big. He will get addressed and then he shouldnt be hard
Dirtybomb,3dnn2o,AMasonJar,1 point,Sat Jul 18 10:33:32 2015 UTC,"The ""shield"" doesnt fully negate damage like phantom does. It still affects his health and you can kill him while cloaked."

Dirtybomb,3dljwx,Best_Zebra,1 point,Fri Jul 17 06:36:54 2015 UTC,"Being in the same tier doesn't mean necessarily equally useful in the same situation.  Imo shotguns should be balanced like the Scattergun in Team Fortress 2. Very powerful meatshots within kissing distance,  a bit more spread, more damage falloff.  As for perks, they should really remove the not so useful perks or at least rework them. And yes, exchange cool on classes that are unlikely to use them(non-flankers basically) for something else.  They are trying their hardest to keep loadouts varied but with the current plethora of terrible perks, they would be better off sticking the same perk everywhere. We just have to wait and see how they iron out the inconsistencies in perk power level."
Dirtybomb,3dljwx,DastardlyCoxcomb,1 point,Fri Jul 17 06:54:50 2015 UTC,"That's what shotguns literally already do, albeit with a little bit of leniency. If anything they need tighter spread while jumping n shit because the spread gets insane.  Unless you prefer the blunderbluss 1 hit kill on a fragger type of balance. 1 hit kills worked for Phantom right, everybody loves his design haha!"

Dirtybomb,3dhwd3,Llebac,2,Thu Jul 16 20:16:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah I know right? Some weapons just feel better, like I love the caulden way more then any revolver or pistol. I never use the timik even though it feels better just because of how bad it is.

Dirtybomb,3dhwd3,rodaphilia,2,Fri Jul 17 03:45:52 2015 UTC,"AK has marginally more RoF while the M4 has somewhat less spread when firing full auto.

Dirtybomb,3dhwd3,zwjerka,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:22:51 2015 UTC,Through the fire and flames we defuse on
Dirtybomb,3dhwd3,DerpsterJ,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:42:24 2015 UTC,"Here's how it works, or at least how it did in closed beta when Stoker was playable:  Enemy proximity mines, frag grenades, Nader's nades and sticky bombs all extinguish Stoker's molotov when they explode in the area of effect. Not just part/chunks of the incendiary effect, but the -whole- thing. Example: Nader nade explodes inside or just outside the perimeter of the area that's on fire, the nade range still hits part of the molotov's radius, extinguishes all fire.  Other things that neutralize molotov:   SH's Airstrike (but not airstrike marker grenade explosion) Arty's Artillery Martyrdom, if a Nader dies and activates it within range Even Red Eye's smoke grenade will act like a fire extinguisher   Things that don't affect Molotov:   Anything that isn't listed above, afaik Orbital Laser Thunder's Concussion grenade   Some quirks surrounding Molotov:   If you deploy/throw a proximity mine inside the effect, the mine will detonate automatically from damage and extinguish the flames. If you throw a molotov on an existing/armed proxy mine, the mine will explode and the molotov will continue to burn/expand. Sticky bombs however will -not- explode inside the fire, so have to be manually detonated If you explode a molotov in an elevated position and the flames rain down on to the ground, the molotov will not be extinguishable if one of the above methods are employed inside the burning area. You instead have to target the initial impact location where the molotov first triggered. Example: Throw at high spot on a wall, fire falls to ground and spreads; sticky bomb point on wall to neutralize. If you throw a Molotov straight up in the air or in a high arc, there is a timer (like a frag nade that can't be cooked). If the molotov reaches this point and explodes in the air rather than on a surface, the flames will not settle on anything, ie have no effect.   A lot of the same things that neutralize Molotov also neutralize Red Eye's smoke, iirc.  All if this is of course subject to change and probably already has in the dev build.  Also, I'm only stating how things have worked in the past; I'll be leaving out my opinion on these various mechanics/quirks associated with the molotov."

Dirtybomb,3djhqx,FesteringGoblin,8,Thu Jul 16 19:44:50 2015 UTC,"For me is fix the obvious RMB thing on the sword, then give all his loadouts a sword.  Replace SMGs with machine pistols.  His armor/cloak is completely fine to me, if they're moving, the cloak drains and they're easy to spot, if not they're standing still.  Fixing the stab issue will make it a risky/reward to try to stab someone with it rather than shooting them.  His health is fine as its pretty much in the middle, if he was lowered to say Vasilli's health he could easily reach up to running 90 or less hp characters."
Dirtybomb,3djhqx,Mellowsnake,4,Thu Jul 16 20:08:33 2015 UTC,"120 HP is tied with Skyhammer for the 3rd most in the game, plus 75 HP from a fully charged cloak, and is absolutely more than a stealthy flanking-focused character should need."
Dirtybomb,3djhqx,LLAMATARIANISM,2,Fri Jul 17 01:20:26 2015 UTC,"120 is pretty much what in other games would be 100, Sadly we're lacking the main anti-Phantom Mercs.  Thunder Who has 160 health and an lmg that can destroy the cloak at K-121 range or closer due to its high rate of fire and ammo capacity and Redeye who has the same health as Phantom at the moment, has a powerful rifle that does 45 damage per shot, can drop smoke grenades to cover both himself and his teammates and to top it all off can see Phantom easily with his monocle, which also counts as detection which means it uncloaks Phantom, so long as Redeye is seeing him.  Finally there are little moments where Phantom will have his cloak fully charged or even close to that unless standing still and in the case of them moving, not only does it deplete faster, but they're pretty easy to spot."
Dirtybomb,3djhqx,Mellowsnake,6,Fri Jul 17 02:31:24 2015 UTC,"Fix melee issues, add some bleed to the cloak."
Dirtybomb,3djhqx,Alphadef,2,Thu Jul 16 19:49:42 2015 UTC,"Define ""Add some bleed"""
Dirtybomb,3djhqx,Mellowsnake,7,Thu Jul 16 20:04:53 2015 UTC,"As it is it absorbs all damage and any damage that removes is fully absorbed. I'd like it if either the shot that removed the cloak bled through and also damaged him with it, or alternatively rather than fully blocking all incoming damage it blocked, say, half of it and the other half bleeds through and damages his real health. Basically keep the stealth shield but weaken it."
Dirtybomb,3djhqx,Alphadef,3,Thu Jul 16 20:10:58 2015 UTC,"I like that idea, but there's also the fact that for the most part a Phantom wont have their shield/cloak full when they reach player unless they activated immediately, knowing the person was near, which tends to be to attack people defending the objectives.   I want to see how well the changes will be once they patch the sword's stab before going into the cloak itself, I can see why people really hate it but there's ways to counter it. The sword, nit so much."
Dirtybomb,3djhqx,Mellowsnake,3,Thu Jul 16 20:26:01 2015 UTC,"To help understand it more, I'd rather use a scenario.  Phantom has 10 hp left on his cloak. He gets hit by a Fragger nade that damages him for 150. Phantom loses his stealth and it is placed on a 6 second cooldown. Phantom lost no hp because his shield tanked the damage into negative value. His real health is still untouched."
Dirtybomb,3djhqx,kirenasura,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:57:16 2015 UTC,"Sad fact, but that would mean that Phantom has 6 seconds where he cant cloak. which basically makes him a Bushwhacker with 10 more health and a katana in most cases and no turret that moves slower. after that point it'd be pretty easy to kill him."
Dirtybomb,3djhqx,Mellowsnake,2,Fri Jul 17 02:32:46 2015 UTC,"But the phantom did his job, because he killed the teams fragger which is a vital merc for tanking, all because phantom managed to take a nade to the face and slice open fragger before fragger could switch back to his primary weapon."
Dirtybomb,3djhqx,D3athR3bel,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:24:47 2015 UTC,"He'll still have killed Fragger, and will probably have run off. 6 seconds really isn't that long. The fact that he has 10 more HP than Bushwhacker is annoying, too. 120 is just too much. It's like giving the Spy 175 HP."
Dirtybomb,3djhqx,AMasonJar,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:08:36 2015 UTC,"Or like how shields work in Titanfall. Shields don't block all damage, but they divide damage between shields and health based on the percentage of shield remaining (less shield = more % of damage goes to health), which rewards Phantom for being fast and engaging with more energy available. This also allows him to keep a decent amount of health compared to the other mercs, which gives him a fighting chance versus mercs like Rhino when he's spotted."
Dirtybomb,3djhqx,NameIzSecret,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:00:52 2015 UTC,I think he means that some amount of damage should get through to a cloaked phantom's health.
Dirtybomb,3djhqx,Aaronerous,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:08:54 2015 UTC,"If that was the case I have mixed feelings about it since the cloaking drains quickly if you're moving and even more if you take damage, a single shotgun blast or even Nader explosion that wasn't a direct hit can remove it entirely."
Dirtybomb,3djhqx,Mellowsnake,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:12:17 2015 UTC,"But a shotgun to the head or a direct hit from nader will not kill him at all , instead only takes down his shield and leave his normal health untoutched."
Dirtybomb,3djhqx,D3athR3bel,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:28:00 2015 UTC,"I also wouldn't mind somehow making the cloak a little more visible; not to just to the eye either. Maybe make a more distinct noise other than buzzing, or making the cloaking activation relatively loud in a small radius."
Dirtybomb,3djhqx,kirenasura,4,Fri Jul 17 00:55:22 2015 UTC,"At the very least, he needs to not be able to activate cloak while taking damage for a free emergency shield.  I can't really think of a good way to make the cloak into a skillful mechanic. Maybe significantly increase the cloak and decloak times? Perhaps the cloak should last indefinitely, but provide no shield and be deactivated instantly on any damage taken, and/or a voluntary deactivation should cause a shorter cooldown while a deactivation caused by damage should cause a longer cooldown."
Dirtybomb,3djhqx,Hyginos,5,Thu Jul 16 20:08:07 2015 UTC,"I can't really think of a good way to make the cloak into a skillful mechanic.   Make it so that taking damage while cloaked harms your ability to attack people. That way you can sneak around, backstab, and even tank damage while running away... but if your target sees you coming you lose your advantage.  It becomes a ""skillful"" mechanic because you have to use it intelligently and avoid getting seen/shot, rather than throwing yourself down the corridor into groups of enemies."
Dirtybomb,3djhqx,Terr_,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:35:38 2015 UTC,"I've tried to cloak while taking damage, during the process where your weapons are still semi visible you still take damage to your health, agree on the decloak maybe being telegraphed and loud forcing you to uncloak to attack, similar go a TF2 spy or the cloak in BF2142"
Dirtybomb,3djhqx,Mellowsnake,14,Thu Jul 16 20:14:51 2015 UTC,Replace KEK10 and Crotzni with Hochfir and SMG9 respectively  Reduce health to 100  Cooldown is always set to max regardless of cloak left  Increase cooldown to 10 or 15 seconds  Katana does half damage on facestab
Dirtybomb,3djhqx,kydaper1,6,Thu Jul 16 20:23:33 2015 UTC,"I'd love this so much. I actually wouldn't mind the damage being raised on backstabs, as a Rhino player I find it odd that I'm left with so much health when they actually sneak around me and hit my back.   Also, the cloak shouldn't act as a ""damage gate."" If he takes enough damage from one source to destroy his shield then he should take the remainder of the damage to his health pool."

Dirtybomb,3djhqx,AMasonJar,-1,Sat Jul 18 03:10:24 2015 UTC,Nerfing all of his abilities seems a bit much to me. One of those would be enough imo. The cloak cooldown would not be fun mechanic.
Dirtybomb,3djhqx,Swahhillie,3,Thu Jul 16 23:59:28 2015 UTC,"IMHO make him full Samurai, no Ninja. His ability keeps its armour but loses stealth. If you play him like a lone wolf, you will still be able to get close through flanking (a la Proxy) and wreak havoc. Play him with your team and you'll be able to block incoming fire for your team since this appearantly was the armours intention from the start. This adds depth to the character.  As for general stats, slightly lower HP but more durable armor. Movespeed is fine.  This because I sincerely believe stealth as a mechanic is toxic to the game and only brings frustration and paranoia to an otherwise fastpaced shooter."
Dirtybomb,3djhqx,ludosaurus,2,Fri Jul 17 00:27:20 2015 UTC,"I'd like to see the following changes:  Health reduced by a small amount, maybe 10 or so. Armor of cloak shield reduced slightly. Recharge of cloak increased by 1 second. Remove the KEK 10, replace with another, slightly weaker gun. Remove ability to multikill with the katana lunge."

This means we need a complex nerf that addresses those problem-areas, while preserving his unique abilities to infiltrate, escape, and assassinate unwary single-targets.     Shooting a cloaked Phantom should make it harder for him to approach you for melee. Shooting a cloaked Phantom should temporarily reduce his ranged accuracy. The Katana's heavy-strike should be ""charged and released"", which decloaks him early and decreases his sustained DPS. All melee heavy-strikes will be limited to affecting single targets. (If still needed) Reduce his uncloaked speed   These changes should have minimal impact on Phantoms who are truly being sneaky and eliminating high-value targets."
Dirtybomb,3djhqx,Terr_,3,Thu Jul 16 22:33:47 2015 UTC,"Option 1: less beefy   Fix Katana hit detection on Mouse2 stop natural health regeneration while cloaked make shield absorb 50% of the damage instead of all of it, while still substracting 100% of the damage from shield energy increase cooldown on cloak to 10 seconds (empty to full), with at least flat 4 seconds before recloaking finally balance the KEK   Option 2: Peashooter   Fix Katana hit detection on Mouse2 stop natural health regeneration while cloaked replace SMGs with machine pistols finally balance the KEK anyway"

Dirtybomb,3djhqx,jonbaa,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:18:17 2015 UTC,"Basically what /u/kydaper1 said with one modification :  Lowered base MS rather than HP.  Then, the cloak loses its shield and instead gives bonus speed that rapidly decays with damage.  I feel that fits more in line with a ""phantom"" because you quickly get in and get out.  As of right now, he's like a tanky ass gun toatin ass knight whereas I feel like he should be more ninja-like."
Dirtybomb,3djhqx,Opira,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:54:04 2015 UTC,So if removal is not available then here is the things i should get hit with.   80hp instant uncloak when taking damage. change the smgs to lesser ones.  unstealth before attack and making some form of sound when doing it.  Reduced movement speed when stealthed.  Significantly reduced damage with melee attack from the front.  No leap attack with right mouse button.  No health regen when cloaked. (or healing at all)
Dirtybomb,3djhqx,getREALppl,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:18:38 2015 UTC,"make armor and cloak two separate abilities that share the same energy pool (think crysis' nano suit). This way, a phantom can stand and fight with an smg, or go all stealth. increase the cool down of his abilities to 10 secs, and make it such that there is an initial cost for activation of either the cloak or the armor (like 10% or sth). attacking while cloaked should have high energy cost after which there is a small delay before energy can start regenerating. decloaking then attacking should have no cost no more than 100 hp (I personally prefer 90). This way, if he will cloak you have a very good chance of killing him only if you spot him. if he wants to go into gun fights, then he can use the armor (in effect hp is similar to fragger). (optional) make the katana heavier than other melees (i.e. make his melee running speed a bit slower than others) ... just a tiny bit (optional) nerf all melee weapons a bit for frontal assault for all mercs, and allow 'executions' for attacks from behind. make some animation for the execution that lasts for ~1sec"
Dirtybomb,3djhqx,Swahhillie,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:41:13 2015 UTC,give his sword attack a big red warning effect. Like fragger/nader explosives. That should make it pretty clear that it is a good idea to run away. Reduce sword stab damage just enough that a low health merc survives by 5 hp. That would increase time to kill significantly.
Dirtybomb,3djhqx,Maffis,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:03:52 2015 UTC,"Give him full invisibility. No more translucent shit that just fool people with poor eye sight.  Remove his armor. If you get hit while fully invisibly, well tough luck.  Give him an animaton when decloaking. Meaning: you must wait half a second before you can attack. This is what I think makes Phantom so OP. You can literally walk into to people and swing your sword from cloak which give basically no time to react. Especially when the Phantom is decent and actually long jumps. This would make Phantom easier to counter if you actually hear/spot him."
Dirtybomb,3djhqx,mark20600,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:29:04 2015 UTC,"Keep most of his kit and make him a lightweight with 30% of his current overshield. He is meant to get behind his enemy and go fast, so let him at the expensive of vulnerability.    Fix melee instead of fixing Phantom. Melee isn't something that feels good when you do it, you just turn into a beyblade. That's not skill, its spam."
Dirtybomb,3djhqx,Vortex902,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:44:52 2015 UTC,"I personally would give him 10 less health, fix the animation on the katana right click swing to not be nearly as long, and increase the cooldown of his stealth to 15 seconds. Also, let damage bypass the shield when it runs out of energy."

Dirtybomb,3dne7h,westinicy,9,Fri Jul 17 18:04:53 2015 UTC,"I think part of the 3 merc limit is that not everyone has all the mercs and someone who could switch between all the mercs would have an advantage over someone with Aura, Skyhammer, and the 3 free ones. It also adds strategy to the game, especially in competitive mode. It would be fun but I personally think it would take away from Dirty Bombs style.   Also, I think the reason cases have their own screen is because it loads the game model for that loadout which you couldn't easily do if you had a match loaded in the background (or loading in the background). Although I also feel like the the 15 second deploy is annoying."
Dirtybomb,3dne7h,inuizzy,6,Fri Jul 17 18:53:37 2015 UTC,"No, the 3-merc thing is a deliberate limitation put in by the the developers.  They're trying to make it so that each teams' merc-picks are part of the strategic meta-game. That's why neither team can see the opposite-team's picks until everybody is locked in, and why joining an in-progress game doesn't let you see the enemy composition until you pick your own.   to continue games after games having to exit each server to change class out of the 3   ... You're doing it wrong.   Pick 3 you want, play the map, and you can repick when it puts you back into the lobby for the next map."
Dirtybomb,3dne7h,Terr_,4,Fri Jul 17 19:57:45 2015 UTC,You don't have to leave the server to change classes in between matches. It's part of a strategy for you to pick and choose what you want to bring to the fight.    But I agree about the cases.
Dirtybomb,3dne7h,acousticdank,4,Fri Jul 17 18:52:20 2015 UTC,This game got called a TF2 clone way before it actually started to get these suggestions. People are trying to make this the new TF2 but it isnt meant to be that way! Changing the WHOLE meta of you knowing what your enemy is CAPABLE of playing is just retarded it takes away alot of the depth. With the current 3 mercs you can at any point see what the enemy MIGHT be doing but with 9 and the change between spawn waves through this whole cycle is just to much to comprehend to actually give a flying about it.

Dirtybomb,3dkf9f,inuizzy,1 point,Fri Jul 17 10:01:59 2015 UTC,"I want a map set on a harbor that has a boat with supplies you have to steal and run to an EV, maybe you repair EV before/after delivery or maybe the EV can be damaged while you are trying to make the deliveries and you cant deliver when it's not repaired.  Then you have to escort the EV around or through a warehouse  to your boat/helicopter. I think the boat could have some really cool close quarters layouts and trick jump potential while the warehouse could be a more open area with some sort of construct-able environment like the train yard walls.   Edit: Just had an idea. Place a Helicopter on top of the warehouse that you have to make a separate delivery to. You would have two separate delivery phases and an EV escort phase in this mode which would be pretty different from the current maps but it might be too long or complicated to actually make."

Dirtybomb,3dme28,kohalikpagan,0,Fri Jul 17 13:34:22 2015 UTC,the problem is they cant just reduce the effectiveness of it vs objectives because what about drug samples? they cant give the person holding the boxes god mode.  and I'd rather see them bitch and use self nerfed classes so my team can stomp them then get blown up by 6 chained airstrikes (that happened last night)

Dirtybomb,3dme28,crymyname,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:59:37 2015 UTC,"I addressed phantom directly in the OP, he gets 50% less duration.  locking mercs is what I want to avoid, I dont wanna have to swap from my SMG proxy just cause there are 4 other assholes running her , I hardly even use my mines.  what this is for is to prevent ability spamming, no one likes chain airstrikes or 3 kira's raining hell from a space laser on the EV.  locking is the WORST way to reduce merc spam.  and it wouldnt take long to set this kind of thing up, weapon stats are simple to adjust, it would take longer to make it detect that there is 3 arty mercs and they need to apply the 50% reduction to his blast radius.  edit: and it would be pretty easy to tell new players whats happening, just add it to the tutorial, or make a pop up when you have too many of the mercs in one round."
Dirtybomb,3dme28,Closet_Indie,2,Fri Jul 17 14:05:01 2015 UTC,"I can guarantee at the level of play where merc stacking is an issue people would still stack even if you put in these weird countermeasures.  If you're not even using your mines, there's plenty of other dudes (and a girl) with SMGs in this game. Man up I guess  The only real situation where this is particulary an issue is airstrike stacking against an ev. Linearly tying dmg to the EV with amount of people in the server could definitely be looked into. All the rest is just plain unnecessary, as the team that spreads their roles should have the edge anyway (in ideal balance settings, of course)  Also, you're vastly underrating the time it takes to put in a system like this which feels right. It's honestly just a bad idea"

Dirtybomb,3dl788,Keshie,0,Fri Jul 17 05:47:01 2015 UTC,"Calling me down syndrome is a bit over doing it, don't you think? I made this thread to try to get the community to understand that it's not good to simply complain about characters or insult others who are having difficulty. I outlined how to deal with phantom and how to exploit his weaknesses.  I made a long, thorough explanation of my beliefs, but instead of explaining to me how I am wrong or mistaken, you simply replied ""you're retarded"".  I'm really disappointed because I wanted to help the community but I wanted phantom to remain strong. After almost 3000 hours of dota2, people always complain when a new hero is added from the original. People always say that the new hero is OP, but no one said that in the old game. That's because the older players were used to dealing with heroes such as earth spirit, but newer players didn't know how to counter him. But, Instead of trying to learn, they complained, and got their way.  How ever, SD is waiting before they do anything, so hopefully you'll read some of my other comments where I outline how to counter phantom."

You clearly lack brain cells if you think he has ""Weakness"". You being bad doesn't mean Phantom has weakness.  The only thing he can't do is EVs but who needs to do that when you can spawn the shit out of the other team so they don't even get close to the EV.  Why are you talking about a MOBA? They are two different beasts. It's a ""Team based FPS"". No other team based FPS were retarded enough to release a stealth character like this I wonder why Sherlock?

Dirtybomb,3dl788,Epix_,2,Fri Jul 17 09:42:55 2015 UTC,"Ok I'm going to repost the real reason why Phantom is OP, its not the sword, though it is very easy for beginners to get kills with it so most people do that. It has nothing to do with the katana.  They aren't being played right in pubs 90% of the time, using the sword most of the time is retarded, you use it as an opportunity weapon.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDwE0m-sBes   This isn't me but its a player who understand what hes doing more then a sword flailing player does, he even gets several aces in this single game.  He is OVERTUNED, he has too much of everything hp speed weaponry flankability for the weapons he has access too.  If you removed his access to the good smgs and lessened the hitbox duration of the katana, he would instantly be balanced because he wouldn't be able to just pop up and frag people quickly from any angle using the KEK10 or Crotz."
Dirtybomb,3dl788,SgtTittyfist,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:18:01 2015 UTC,"So here's what I do.  I got good at playing Phantom. It took a whole 5 minutes.  If the enemy team has a Phantom, then I play Phantom.  When people get fed up with being one shorted by an armored cloaker and start moaning in chat I offer to switch to another class as long as the enemy Phantom does too.  Sometimes this works, sometimes it doesn't.  The best is when I don't even have to bring out Phantom because the enemy team hasn't either.  Fletcher is much more fun anyway.  And that is how I deal with enemy Phantoms."

Dirtybomb,3dl788,UneasierMars,-1,Fri Jul 17 18:50:54 2015 UTC,"I've also seen people say that they don't have a lot of time to spend on dirty bomb and get better at it, and they just want to have a fun time.  Not to sound mean, but maybe dirty bomb isn't for you. A lot of this game revolves around advanced decision making, team work, and raw aiming prowess.  Let's say you want to play skyhammer and the next map is underground. Your airstrike just won't be as effective, and skyhammer won't be the best pick for your loadout. The game just isn't built for players to say, ""I feel like rolling some skyhammer, arty, and bushwacker"" what happens if you have no medics? Or your teammates won't switch? You're going to get your ass kicked, its just how the game works.  So in regards to the notion that skilled players know how to deal with phantom, I kind of have to agree. Phantom shouldn't be neutered so that unaware players who haven't put time in the game can deal with him easily."
Dirtybomb,3dl788,UneasierMars,4,Fri Jul 17 04:47:33 2015 UTC,"Brah, imma just spend some time here with you. The problems people have with phantom: crazy absorbing shield on his cloak, access to really good smgs, access to best melee and 120 health. ON A CHARACTER THAT IS SUPPOSE TO BE THE STEALTHY PICK PEOPLE OUT OF POSITION CHARACTER. Imagine if spy from tf2 had uber on his cloak, health equal to a soldier and a good smg. Tell me that's gonna make the game fun for people. Tell me its balanced please."
Dirtybomb,3dl788,herbart,-1,Fri Jul 17 04:58:26 2015 UTC,"If a team has a phantom on it, that's one less team player they have. Phantom tends to run into a group of enemies,  and kill the farthest back character. You can take advantage of him making a risky attack separated from his team.  To do this, when you are attacked by phantom, double jump as much as possible and find some teammates. Stick close to teammates to make this an easy task. The teammates will usually shoot and kill him, then revive you IF he manages to kill you.  On the flip side, watch your teammates' backs. He chases after the separated, alone players rather than the big group of players. I often find myself in a 3v1 against phantom by watching my teammates' backs, as well as running like hell and asking for back up.  Especially in 5v5 and 6v6, with this sort of team play, phantom starts to become a liability for his team. He isn't giving ammo, health, airstikres, or defusing/setting c4's. He won't be getting kills and contribute little to his team.   Understand that most phantoms don't carefully choose their situations, they take the lowest hanging fruit as soon as possible. If you know this and keep up your awareness, phantom becomes a manageable (and fun) merc to play against.  also upvote/downvote based on relevancy, not because I don't think phantom is OP"
Dirtybomb,3dl788,Schoolgirls_,2,Fri Jul 17 05:09:14 2015 UTC,"I never vote anyway so don't worry about that also I am not petty XD. But here lies the problem. The presence of phantom atm just makes teams afraid. Not afraid that he's gonna kill one of them, but afraid how they will kill him. I pumped 3 remburg shots into him at close range and he just ate them,his mother should really feed him or something. He then proceeded to back up and kill me using kek-10 and some revolver (idk revolvers well). The problem is basically he has advantages, but no disadvantages. He is as good at close range as he is at medium range. I have seen phantoms just making laps of the objective killing anyone who tries to complete it. Or even standing on top of the c4 invisible (those ones are easy to deal with). The problem for me is that he has too many advantages and no or too little advantages. Phantom can either pick people off or engage at medium range with his amazing selection of smgs. So the whole just push objective really doesn't work."
Dirtybomb,3dl788,herbart,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:39:52 2015 UTC,"Ya, it does seem a bit absurd that doing damage to him just drains his cloak. Maybe he should be slower while uncloaked and damage drains more cloak than it already does?"
Dirtybomb,3dl788,Schoolgirls_,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:14:25 2015 UTC,"Personally, I think they should just take away the shield, keep the cloak, exchange the smgs for machine pistols and lower health by 10 or keep it the same. Thus will force him to use his cloak to flank rather than use it to tank and also will force him to be close quarters. Kinda like sparks his primary should be his melee (hers is the medigun) not a smg."
Dirtybomb,3dl788,herbart,2,Fri Jul 17 18:40:52 2015 UTC,what do i do when he starts shooting me from stealth with his overpowered kek 10 like any good player would?

Dirtybomb,3dl788,VorteX135,2,Fri Jul 17 06:39:46 2015 UTC,with the fact that he gets the drop on you even if you start shooting first because of the shield?
Dirtybomb,3dl788,mark20600,1 point,Fri Jul 17 06:45:17 2015 UTC,Yeah. I did it earlier with Sparks and went 11/3 for a relatively quick round with those deaths being one Phantom and two Fragger. I just moved around a bit and mowed through his shield and some of his HP with the Tolin and finished with the pistol. It's not always like that but not everyone has the best aim.
Dirtybomb,3dgnun,DOGpls,25,Thu Jul 16 03:07:15 2015 UTC,"Some comments on this list from me :)   There will be updates to the Spectator HuD in the next update. It will be much better according to shoe. The competitive community “will love it”.   The very next release will have some initial changes but there's plenty more we're planning  Features like private matchmaking have been pushed back due to working on Phantom balancing.   This isn't strictly true, as private matchmaking is worked on by entirely different people  shoe confirms that the team has been removing some console commands lately. They’ve found players doing shady things like removing explosive effects and things like trees which would give them an unfair advantage. They understand some of these console commands have helped people get better performance out of the game, but they are currently working on an “Ultra Low” setting that will help out a lot of people with low-end PCs and laptops.   The config clamping will be coming in before we get the new menu options, which may annoy a few people but we wanted to make sure there was a level playing field. We'll be introducing a 'Minimal' graphics option (with more things turned off/lowered) and improving the Auto-detect performance settings for people  ADS Sensitivity can be changed in console. They want to add a slider but its low priority with their limited dev resources.   This is being worked on for the release AFTER next, it will give the option for SetFOVSensitivityScale between 0 and 1  Fixing bugs will always take priority over adding features.   Yep, we've increased our time allocated for bug-fixing for each future release"
Dirtybomb,3dgnun,SmoothUK,2,Thu Jul 16 10:35:28 2015 UTC,"""The config clamping will be coming in before we get the new menu options""  it's not April Fools lol I don't get it"
Dirtybomb,3dgnun,Busdriverx,8,Thu Jul 16 11:14:22 2015 UTC,"Anything we've found that we feel is going too far/exploiting (such as disabling effects, or downscaling textures to the point that it provides an advantage) will now not be possible via editing configs.  Players can still edit configs, just more values now have a fixed Min/Max in code that the game will allow."
Dirtybomb,3dgnun,SmoothUK,5,Thu Jul 16 11:31:24 2015 UTC,I still really want to see how 32/64 textures provide an advantage over 128/256 or 256/512 (can't remember which one you want to clamp it to)
Dirtybomb,3dgnun,Kroad,7,Thu Jul 16 12:08:19 2015 UTC,"We looked at it for each individual TextureGROUP. Generally world textures are limited to a minimum of 256, some are 512, some 128 some 64.  The performance gained by setting textures lower than this is absolutely minimal and removes more detail from the environments than we are happy with, which gives those players who config tweak a minor advantage (when it comes to spotting enemies/movement) over those who don't.  We want there to be as level a playing field as possible where we can. Yes there are many things out of our control but that shouldn't stop us from doing what little we can.  One of the best ways to help performance is to try setting PoolSize (in ShooterEngine.ini -> TextureStreaming) to 33%-50% of your available Video RAM. This means that there's much less time spent steaming textures in and out and you have an overall smoother experience. It's something we'll likely expose in the menus, but caveat it as an 'at your own risk' option since if you run out of VRAM it's going to break things.  Other config clamping includes player no longer able to disable effects, draw boxes around all players, or re-colour all textures and player models etc. etc:   http://i.imgur.com/HsxG5Uz.jpg http://i.imgur.com/v2BtSff.jpg"
Dirtybomb,3dgnun,SmoothUK,4,Thu Jul 16 13:31:41 2015 UTC,"obviously those two screenshots should not be possible (not sure why anyone would actually play with 2nd one tho) and I understand clamping them, I would just like to see comparative screenshots of a place/situation in which 32/64 textures gives an advantage"
Dirtybomb,3dgnun,Kroad,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:49:55 2015 UTC,"Problem here is that you are talking about visual reasons, Smooth is talking about perfomance.   That said, personally I play with every texturegroup clamped to 256 atm and it has zero effect on both performance and visual advantages or disadvantages(compared to both 32, 64 and 512 clamps). It's literally only about personal visual preference imo. There are differences obviously, but I don't think the difference between 32 and 256 is of impact to the level playing field. However if SD clamps things there's probably a reason for it and you'll just have to deal with it regardless :P"
Dirtybomb,3dgnun,adetonian,2,Thu Jul 16 15:25:20 2015 UTC,"which is why I want SD to say the reason, instead of posting two irrelevant screenshots of things that aren't even possible anymore. There being no performance impact is because game is bottlenecked by cpu for most (doesn't mean that no one will benefit from lower textures) and no performance impact doesn't mean it should be removed either.  just seems to me like SD (and a lot of devs today) spend too much time worrying about equal playing field when it's just personal preference, leads to stuff like fov being locked in OW etc"
Dirtybomb,3dgnun,Kroad,2,Thu Jul 16 15:34:36 2015 UTC,What are the screenshots going to mean though? If SD gives you two screenshots and they say its enough of a difference to clamp it and you disagree its probably still going to get clamped :P You know enough about configs to test things for yourself so you've probably already seen the differences.
Dirtybomb,3dgnun,adetonian,0,Thu Jul 16 15:50:53 2015 UTC,"I have seen the differences, just don't see it the advantage   like i said the two screenshots aren't even possible anymore so I don't see their relevance and even if they were possible, they have nothing to do with textures.   and isn't the whole point of reddit to whine knowing that nothing will get changed anyway :D?"
Dirtybomb,3dgnun,Kroad,5,Thu Jul 16 15:58:20 2015 UTC,"All of my config edits are to make the game run smooth, is that considered an advantage too? Back in early beta I got 250-300fps on every map on my old GPU, now I'm running the lowest settings I can force with current config options and it's 150-200ish at most points. When the next round of clamping comes it might be lower than 150 fairly often."
Dirtybomb,3dgnun,Busdriverx,10,Thu Jul 16 12:58:16 2015 UTC,"I hope you're going to be rather generous with those min/max values. While I agree that some config changes do grant quite significant advantages, I would argue that so do some other factors that have nothing to do with config files. Some people will always be at an advantage over others for one reason or another:   Players who have a 144Hz monitor and a PC capable of running the game at 144FPS will have a huge advantage over those playing on 60Hz monitors and having a difficult time maintaining a stable 60+ FPS.  People who have a good mouse, mouse pad and sensitivity settings will have an advantage over those who don't. Those who play with quality headphones will have an edge over those playing with low quality speakers. Players who have lower pings and more stable connections will have an advantage over those who suffer from the opposite.   There are primarily two types of players who make heavy config changes when they start playing a new FPS game:   Those who want to play competitively and desire a more pure FPS experience, without all the flashy graphical effects and distracting environmental clutter. Those who are unable to run the game at their desired FPS.   When it comes to the first group, in all likelihood they're going to be playing against people who've made similar config changes. And if they do play against non competitive players, the latter won't be losing because they lack certain config settings, but rather because they're not as skilled at the game.  As for the second group, those yearning for better performance, the only thing you will do by limiting config settings is put those players at a disadvantage, thus doing the opposite of levelling the playing field."
Dirtybomb,3dgnun,DarcseeD,4,Thu Jul 16 12:13:02 2015 UTC,"Welcome to the wonderful world of PC gaming where each users setup is different and paying more gets you more.

Dirtybomb,3dgnun,DarkangelUK,7,Thu Jul 16 13:52:18 2015 UTC,"Welcome to the wonderful world of PC gaming where each users setup is different and paying more gets you more. This has always been the case in PC gaming since forever, spouting it now like it's suddenly a new thing is just ignorance.   Please point to the part of my post where I said that hardware giving players advantages is a new thing, before you call me ignorant for statements I've never made.   The reasons stated for limiting the config changes are pretty sound, the fact that SD are even working on a bare-minimum config is more than most devs do these days.   Again, did I indicate that it's a bad thing? I merely pointed out that if they go overboard with the config limitations, they're not evening the playing field, but doing the opposite.   If you have a slow PC then the devs can only do so much to assist with graphical tweaking without harming the integrity of the game, to come on here and bare faced blame them for the game not running well on an old, out of date system is just a complete dick move.   What are you talking about? Did you accidentally reply to my post instead of someone else's? Where did I ""blame them""?   I'm on an old system running low settings with 0 config tweaks and I know I'm well overdue for an upgrade, however I can still push about 60fps with an old 1st gen i7 and a 570GTX which is below minimum recommended specs for any game these days...   If you're fine with ""about 60 FPS"" (which to me sounds like not stable 60 FPS), then great. I'm sure there are people who are fine playing this game at 30 FPS as well.  Fact is, you can't argue that someone with better hardware, playing the game at 144FPS on a 144Hz monitor, will have a huge advantage over you. Of course, it's your prerogative to not make config tweaks in an attempt to reduce that advantage. But were I in your shoes, I most certainly would.   if you're running lower than that then it's not the devs job to make the game run better for you at that point.   The job of the devs is to make the game run as well as possible on the widest range of hardware setups possible. Currently the game is just not very well optimized, since as I'm sure you're well aware, there are plenty of graphically more impressive games which run much better.  I think you didn't even understand what I wrote in my original post and just typed out a knee-jerk reaction for some reason. I'm not opposed to limiting the changes that can be made to the config files, so that certain tweaks are made impossible, I'm merely saying that they should be careful about not making the game unplayable for people on lower hardware setups.  Furthermore, considering the poor state of anti-cheat in this game, they run the risk of driving players who currently rely on low spec configs to look for 3rd party programs to make the game run better. And those often come with features that are much more invasive than config tweaks.   Let the downvote bomb commence   Yay! Let's be passive-aggressive!"

I don't like aimpunch as much as the next guy, but if they're going to have it in, then I'd like them to reduce it. And it sounds like they're going to do just that, but if I had it my way, I'd remove aimpunch for everything except when a sniper is scoped. Snipers in pubs are easy to deal with, but when you go up against someone who's got great aim and a little brain, it's a little much for them not to have much of a weakness."

Dirtybomb,3dgnun,CompoundMiterSaw,-1,Thu Jul 16 17:38:58 2015 UTC,Whats your argument for not keeping it? Simply because you think its a terrible mechanic now that you actually know it exists? Literally no one complained about it before the patch because it wasn't noticeable on anything but the hardest hitting guns.
Dirtybomb,3dgnun,TheShaMAN465,1 point,Thu Jul 16 11:14:04 2015 UTC,"I, as well as most competitive players, were complaining about it since we started playing the game. Most pub players didn't notice it because it was more subtle before but just because you don't notice something doesn't mean it's not a bad thing. For example, if half the community was using a subtle aimbot that went entirely unnoticed it would still be a bad thing. In battlefield most people didn't notice that there was visual recoil because they just assumed they were missing because of bad hitreg and their weapons having high spread but that didn't mean visual recoil was a good thing and so it was completely removed."
Dirtybomb,3dgnun,ChinaRep,3,Sat Jul 18 20:20:20 2015 UTC,"I don't see how that's an argument for keeping it. It was never a good idea - this patch just made it so glaringly obvious that even those people who thought their aim was just kinda shit couldn't help but feel it.  Frankly, I didn't realize it was in. I'm not a big FPS guy, and the whole concept of aimpunch just didn't even occur to me. I just figured I needed more practice aiming - and I do - but part of the problem is aimpunch. All the practice in the world isn't going to help me with that.  Now that I'm consciously aware of it, it just feels so terrible. I hope just turning it down will be enough."

Honestly before the patch the only thing I actually noticed aim punch was witch snipers and the revolver"
Dirtybomb,3dgnun,TheShaMAN465,1 point,Thu Jul 16 11:12:19 2015 UTC,"I don't. With me and I guess you, it shows not everybody will notice aimpunch. I didn't realize it was a thing and just figured I was shit at aiming (and I am, but not quite that bad I guess). For other people, it just wasn't bad enough for them to make a big deal out of it.  Neither of those things shows that aimpunch is good, or even okay. It just means people were stupid (me), or weren't riled up enough before. Just because now they think they have a chance to influence the devs for the better doesn't mean they liked it before."
Dirtybomb,3dgnun,sgdfgdfgcvbn,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:04:47 2015 UTC,"You can't justify a mechanic being in the game by essentially saying ""it's not THAT bad, guys."" If you want to actually justify why it should stay, then provide some examples of what it adds to the game and how it enhances the gameplay. The reason why it should be removed is because it prevents players with good aim from consistently getting headshots. Since, as far as I'm concerned, it doesn't add any positive aspects to the game, I see no objective reason to keep it in the game at all."

Dirtybomb,3dgnun,SquirmyBurrito,2,Thu Jul 16 12:07:12 2015 UTC,"Lol so you admit, there are some definite broken abilities concerning phantom. That's our problem. If he has all the good parts, that broken beyblade bullshit is what's gamebreaking. The way melee works in this game and the Katana's range and animation length is what makes this crap stupidly broken. If they aren't going to fix his hitbox for that, and make the sword actually take some skill, versus literally W+M1+wiggle (which I don't know how they'd do it without fundamentally changing that on all melee weapons for all characters), they need to remove some of his other positives, like the refractive armor straight up eating a proxy mine. No merc should be able to eat any explosive and stay full health, especially when he gets a katana and can stay completely invisible to some people."
Dirtybomb,3dgnun,littlestminish,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:31:49 2015 UTC,"Sure, I never denied that the beyblade thing was broken, but that isn't a phantom specific issue. It applies to all melee weapons to a varying degree. I don't exactly agree with the katana's range being an issue, but I will agree that it has far too much linger on it. And he isn't completely invisible, he's spottable. If he just ate an explosive, he also no longer has a cloak active."
Dirtybomb,3dgnun,SquirmyBurrito,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:00:21 2015 UTC,"That's the thing. The merc with a 1-click on all mercs (if you take into the fact he can beyblade even without the macro), can eat ANY explosive and be at 120 HP. No other merc can do that. If fragger hits me with a well timed grenade, his only ability, I deserve to die, unless I'm Rhino, and even then I deserve to be close to death. In Phantom's case, he's at full health with the best SMG in the game.  The Katana's length just accentuates how much of the problem the melee linger is in the game. It may need a rework if this shit is to stay in as it is, because beyblade on reach like that just makes this game look like a budget title with zero QA.  Also, you can tell me he isn't completely invisible, but me and at least a few others will tell you that we can't see him in most circumstances. Also, his sound is intermittent, I can be listening for it and for whatever reason the virtual directional surround sound that determines whether I hear it ""behind me"" or not will make the sound completely silent.  Squirmy, I know you like him. I've played with you, you're no means a bad player, but you need to give a concession here and admit he has only good qualities and no downsides for his speed, HP pool, and damage output, and that his ""tells"" are very intermittent for some, making his OP-ness downright unfair, cheesy, and unfun for many people."

Sure, it would be more in line if they reduced a few numbers slightly like his HP and maybe speed... but the real change I think needs to happen is make it so his armor doesn't give him HP, but rather make it so when he uses it he takes reduced damage."

Dirtybomb,3dgnun,kirenasura,4,Thu Jul 16 12:14:39 2015 UTC,"I dunno, after playing a fair bit of Phantom and since switching back to other classes only playing him from time to time, I don't honestly think he is that big of a deal people are making him out to be. Once you actually play Phantom you very quickly realize ""wait if I backpeddle and shoot him...He can't kill me with the katana?"". Sure he can pull out the kek10 but that is a gun issue more then Phantom. You learn all the Phantom routes to get behind teams, you learn to look for that (very fucking obvious) black haze moving across the screen. Phantom as a concept is a high risk high reward class, removing the high reward just leaves a high risk class with no real incentive to play him. Contrary to popular belief you can easily kill Phantom in half a magazine from most guns even with full shield, if he gets behind the medic line of sparks yes he is going to kill you all, he should.  I would say if SD wants Phantom to be an assassin like he is supposed to be, remove the shield on his invis, change the name of his refractive armor to refractive cloak, and make him far harder to detect in invis (right now his invis is a joke, you can see it halfway across the map if you are not blind), lower his health to maybe 100, make his cloak not drain energy or make it drain super slow if not moving. Small things to tweak Phantom in line to be an actual stealth assassin and not a katana maniac with an invis shield and higher then average HP. I don't think SD needs to do balance changes on the demand on pubs to be completely honest but that is just me, if pubs are anything to go by Proxy's mines are OP because they kill you if you run over them, Naders martyrdom is broken because you tried to knife her after she died.  TL;DR: Phantom is fine imo, he is just a new merc with a new playstyle and people will adapt and calm down. If you have to change him just rework him into an ACTUAL stealth assassin."

A single and competent fragger with map awareness can kill 4 guys camping an aura station easily with a frag and clean up with M4 brain drains.  Fragger is the premier murder class for two very good reasons - the M4 is amazing, and two timed frags are two guaranteed kills at the least. Phantom does not get played often in comp, as most people have mics and headphones and aren't totally oblivious."

Dirtybomb,3dgnun,Booty_Lord,-2,Thu Jul 16 04:35:36 2015 UTC,Vass is a hard counter to phantom and redeye would be as well; there's no reason to assume infrared wouldn't work on his cloak. Redeye having an ability that counters phantom would be enough of a nerf without watering down what phantom does. Many pub vassili's put their HB sensor right at their feet or in awful places which essentially makes it worthless against a competent phantom. As soon as redeye starts shooting at a cloaked phantom any friendly who isn't oblivious would most likely jump in.
Dirtybomb,3dgnun,caitsith01,3,Thu Jul 16 05:01:38 2015 UTC,Vass is a hard counter to phantom   How so?  Because he can throw one scanner?
Dirtybomb,3dgnun,Booty_Lord,-2,Thu Jul 16 05:55:31 2015 UTC,"The scanner completely removes phantom's cloaking ability. It doesn't even flare up, which means no cloak and no shield. I will say that I was surprised after a couple days and I realized vass can only put out one scanner at a time. If they reduced the radius and gave him two that would be pretty decent. It would also alleviate the problem most pub vassilis have, which is just dropping the sensor at their feet, which usually helps no one."

Bearing in mind he is invisible and this is with a long range semi-automatic rifle while trying to back up and evade.  With Proxy, you need to get close to a full clip into his head.

Dirtybomb,3dgnun,Booty_Lord,-5,Thu Jul 16 18:22:06 2015 UTC,"Never understood the hate for phantom. First day playing was 2nd or 3rd day of phantom's release.  The first thing I noticed was that you can see the guy during cloak. Then I noticed most phantoms run in a straight line at you with their katana out. Then I noticed it took less than a full mag of SMG fire to kill one even during cloak. After that, I realized I could hear his footsteps while cloaked. Some time later, I also found out that he makes a constant noise while cloaked. That's in addition to whatever stupid VO line his RNG decides to put out there. IMHO ""wee ooo"" is the best/worst one as it's fairly loud and long lasting. He does however have 3 or 4 lines that are very fast or relatively quiet.  This was all in my first day playing. I never had a problem with him. Melee phantoms are playing high risk high reward - if they get caught out of position they're most likely dead. Once you figure all of this junk out, it's mostly just understanding the general tactics a phantom will employ. Your biggest gripe should be beyblading phantoms, as that is clearly not intended. There's at least 30 active frames on M2 and if you told me it was over 60 I'd believe it. The kek is overrated I think but it is still an excellent gun, and most phantoms who are competent will be getting most of their kills from their SMG.  I bought phantom my 2nd or 3rd day once I got 50k cuz I thought he was cool as hell and I loved how mad kids got. Even something as silly as a 2:1 KDR phantom will send people into a frothing rage.   But playing as phantom let me understand how the playstyle works for both kek-ing and katana-ing.   It is purely the enemy team's failure when I do even sort of good as a phantom. Enemies make awful choices all the time when facing a phantom. Many of the things people do against a phantom make 0 sense to me as someone who has played phantom.  Vassili's will hog the HB and stand on it, effectively wasting it. That's bad against 0 phantoms and I'd consider it griefing if the enemy team has a phantom or 2. People will chase you around a corner, where you can wait with your M2 ready. They'll ignore footsteps behind them or to the sides. If you disengage and they don't pursue you, pubbers will forget about you in less than 5 seconds. Every time. Squishies will wander off on their own, or worse, they'll clump up and all face the same direction. They will do all of these mistakes, all in combination with having no idea what phantom is or is not capable of, and then they'll throw DSP-styled tantrums.  I've been on the receiving end of this when not playing as phantom: A competent phantom consistently flanked and attacked from the rear, without fail, just about every spawn wave. He'd kill two or three squishies depending on reaction time and how close together they were standing.   But, when someone bothers to get on a mic and mention ""phantom behind us"" he would melt every time. Along with that, if anyone spotted him during cloak and fired on him, everyone in the vicinity would follow suit. It takes very little coordination to shut down a phantom, but it does take coordination. 1v1 phantom has the advantage cuz he can initiate when he wants, where he wants. He has 0 utility so his murder capabilities are very good, but against a team that's slightly aware, I'd say a fragger is better at pubstomping. Timed grenades can accomplish the same thing beyblade does, from a safer distance and without requiring commitment. The m4 is also amazing.  Fraggers can go like, 6:1 and no one says anything. But a phantom gets a little hot, maybe 4:1, or even 3:1, and people start shitting blood and vomiting acid. I don't get it."
Dirtybomb,3dgnun,Seaman182,17,Thu Jul 16 04:36:26 2015 UTC,"I can't speak to statistics, but anecdotally speaking phantom is the only merc I have seen break 50 kills in a match. Bad phantoms are bad, yeah, but even moderately good ones are a huge threat; stealth, survivability, melee, and ranged is quite the combo.  Add that to the fact that they're better at completing and objectives than the other kill-dedicated mercs (stealth and survivability again) and you have the makings of a balance issue.

I've broken 50 with fragger. It's easier with him IMO as timed frags are safe and almost guaranteed kills. I've played with rhinos that went 60/10 or better, and that's without a pocket medic. When I break 50 kills with phantom, there's usually a lot of deaths involved. I can get high KDRs with phantom, like 10/1 or 7/1, but I'm getting less than 30 kills in matches like that and much closer to 20. Overall I do much better with fragger, and if I'm not being overly aggressive, fletcher or sparks. That's counting kdr and objective control.  The game should NOT be balanced around the average player and pubs, because the average player is totally oblivious and incompetent, and most people don't give a shit what happens in a pub as long as they get to play their favorite class.  ""Add that to the fact that they're better at completing and objectives than the other kill-dedicated mercs""  This is only a factor if you leave objectives completely undefended. If that is the case, you deserve to get a ninja plant/defuse/whatever. You ABSOLUTELY deserve it.

These people are aware of their surroundings, actually use their eyes, and know how to backpedal, making my M2 useless. (protip - walking backwards is the biggest weakness for W+M2 Phantoms). I could kill certain players easily, because they were predictable, and walked straight into me without seeing me. Competent players would shut me down the moment they saw me, and I'd have to attack elsewhere.The classes I found the most trouble with were Fraggers, and Bushwackers who were competent with their SMGs and placed their turrets in places that surprised me and killed me the moment I uncloaked to attack. Although I would frequently topscore, I found myself second as far as kills go by a Fragger, so although I think Phantom is a fun killing machine, a good Fragger will do much more to shut down any enemies.  I bought him the same day of release, and stomped with him, and said ""man, this guy is OP as fuck!"" Then when I got bored of him, I switched classes, and used what I learned to fight against the other Phantoms, and what I found was strange - very few Phantoms were consistently killing me, because I used what I learned while playing him to easily spot him, take down his cloak, and let my team hammer him once they could clearly see him.  I have yet to decide if he's really OP, or if people just need to ""get gud"", to quote a Phantom player in a lobby from the other day."
Dirtybomb,3dgnun,Theevun,-2,Thu Jul 16 05:12:10 2015 UTC,"So my biggest problem with phantom is something you highlighted yourself. ""phantom behind us"". I've never had to hear someone say that for say, Proxy. Or Vasilli in the window. or Whacker turret around the corner. Those mercs don't require the effort of the whole team to take down they can be outplayed 1v1.   I am worried they'll over-'balance' him. He needs to just drop 1 thing. Whether it be some health, which primary weapon he gets, how wide his katana arc is, just about any small change to any of those things will really open up a more straightforward way to out play a phantom 1v1 which is where I think most of the frustration comes from.  While were talking about balance...fragger has too much health and it's really frustrating to open up short-range on a vasilli with an auto weapon and have him just turn and 1 shot you while taking hits. People hate aimpunch but that to me is really frustrating."
Dirtybomb,3dgnun,Booty_Lord,-5,Thu Jul 16 05:55:56 2015 UTC,"Phantom does not take the effort of a whole team and phantom can be outplayed 1v1. It's really insulting that you just assume everyone else has the same problems you do.  "" I've never had to hear someone say that for say, Proxy. Or Vasilli in the window. or Whacker turret around the corner. ""  And this is why the game shouldn't be balanced around pub play. Your team's lack of communication is not a justification for not telling each other important info.  The last part of your post is complaining about what those mercs are supposed to do, which is excel at murder. If a vass does a 180 and quickscopes you in the dome, he deserves the kill. Fragger is designed for murder. That's why he's good at it and has a lot of health. It's stupid to complain about it."
Dirtybomb,3dgnun,Theevun,2,Thu Jul 16 06:09:00 2015 UTC,"So i offer constructive reasons why its frustrating to play against a phantom relative to other mercs. I offer constructive ways to help balance out the frustrations of the distinct advantages phantom has in 1v1 duels. And all you can offer up is: I'm offended, Learn 2 play, and your terrible opinion that quickscoping is something that belongs in FPS games.   Got it."
Dirtybomb,3dgnun,Booty_Lord,-2,Thu Jul 16 06:28:44 2015 UTC,"Because it wasn't constructive. Your entire experience is based around pugs, and you are expecting the game to be balanced around pugs, which are extremely low levels of play, not just for this game, but all games. You're complaining that it takes a small amount of communication (3 words) to prevent something bad from happening in a team based game. That makes no sense to me. Phantom is supposed to have the advantage in 1v1 duels. That means don't engage him 1 on 1 unless you think you can win. If you aren't sure you can win you probably can't. Rhino is the same way, man. If you try to go 1v1 against a rhino he's probably going to eat you alive.  I don't understand your gripe about quickscoping at all. This isn't CoD - quickscoping does not carry some sort of heavy handed auto aim that almost guarantees a hit if your reticle is anywhere near the enemy. If a vass quick scopes you that was all on him: he had a severely reduced FoV and had to hit you right in the head, all in the span of a second or so. Now, unless vass gets some kind of aim assist while doing this, there's nothing wrong with it. Railgun in quake performed the exact same function, only it did not require scoping at all. I didn't want to tell you ""git gud"" but that really is the solution to your woes if your woes are ""why can't I keep this guy from sneaking up on me"" or ""why can't I stop him from killing me 1v1"""
Dirtybomb,3dgnun,SquirmyBurrito,-9,Thu Jul 16 06:48:33 2015 UTC,Fingers crossed that they don't neuter Phantom to appease the circlejerk and that whatever changes they do make improve his competitive desirability.
Dirtybomb,3dgnun,OrbitalStrikeBadger,2,Thu Jul 16 03:42:32 2015 UTC,"When a character is making the game less fun for 80+% of your playerbase, whether they're balanced or not is kind of irrelevant.  The fact is that he's reducing the enjoyment of the majority, the majority are the ones they want paying money to buy characters.  Hence it is in their best interest to make Phantom less unfun to fight against.  A game must be both balanced and fun for the majority.  I don't personally find him particularly unbalanced, but he is a total buzzkill in that I'm trying to play a shooter and he's playing Chivalry."
Dirtybomb,3dgnun,SquirmyBurrito,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:49:32 2015 UTC,"This issue is that, the only way to make him 'fun' to fight against (from what I'm seeing suggested) is to neuter his melee and to remove his 'invisibility'.

Dirtybomb,3divgl,ThrtLvlJuke,9,Thu Jul 16 17:03:46 2015 UTC,"I'm LE in CS:GO as well and I've been playing dirty bomb for about a month. Most of the advice given here is from people that do not have a good understanding of what being LE in CS:GO means. Playing the objective and aiming for the head is something an LE will do far better than the average DB player.   Play this game like you would pistol round. The main difference there isn't a severe penalty for jumping like in CS:GO so you can do that too. There aren't any spray patterns. From what I've gathered, the longer you shoot, the more it will spread from the center of your cross hair. There aren't any recoil patterns to learn like in CS:GO. You can reduce this slightly by crouching, but I usually prefer to keep moving around. Your aiming habits from CS will give you a huge advantage (crosshair placement, holding corners, peeking). The ttk in this game is much longer, meaning your superior aim will let you win fights even if the enemy starts out by shooting you in the back.  ADS as little as possible. All ADS does in this game is reduce your FOV, you are just as accurate shooting from the hip. This is a huge advantage for CS players because it is what we are used to, and it allows you to stay mobile against players that ADS every time they shoot. You do not suffer aimpunch (or just a little) when you shoot from the hip. When you ADS, you move slower and you are affected by aimpunch). Your HUD can be customized to be similar to what you're used to. A big thing is moving the mini-map to the top-right corner, because you're probably used to constantly checking there. This can be done through an online HUD generator and editing some files. I really suggest playing a support character that can provide ammo (Skyhammer, Arty, or Kira). They also have rifles that reward good aim more than smgs or shotguns. As an LE in CSGO you will easily outfrag almost every other player. If you play another class, you are semi-dependent upon other players to provide you ammo. It not uncommon when I play a class that isn't a support and I run out of ammo in my primary and my secondary.  Don't bother with competitive right now. There are as many, if not more cheaters, than there are in CS:GO, due to the game being free to play. The difference is that most of the cheaters just rage hack right from the beginning and don't even try to hide it as there is no Overwatch system. Consequently, you will probably be accused of cheating all the time because the average Dirty Bomb players can't aim.  This is going to be an unpopular opinion, but you are a far greater asset to the team as someone who can actually aim, to just concentrate on getting kills. Anyone can go to an objective and hold ""F"", or run up to a fallen teammate and revive them. Far fewer people will have the raw aim that you possess. Fight towards the objective, but don't waste your time actually doing anything else rather than killing. Keeping the majority of the enemy team dead is going to directly help your team win."
Dirtybomb,3divgl,dumbniggerrisks,0,Thu Jul 16 19:53:37 2015 UTC,"ADS is actually very helpful at medium / long range, to the point where it makes shotgun's spread tighter. That being said, it is still really only worth using sometimes."

So you can keep the same muscle memory.  I don't play CS:GO but if you want to use rifles and you want to be rewarded for accuracy, you should play Skyhammer, Kira, Arty or Fragger. The first 3 of those all give out ammo. Skyhammer has 2 full-auto ARs and 1 burst-fire AR. Arty and Kira has 2 burst-fire ARs and 1 semi-auto AR. Fragger has 1 full-auto AR, 1 LMG and 1 burst-fire AR. I wouldn't recommend Arty right now, he's UP for a variety of reasons. Although he is currently free."

Skyhammer is a solid merc for learning the game, but don't be afraid to try the free rotation mercs to see if you like them better. Aura has the fastest runspeed in the game, if you play her a few games in a row all the other mercs should seem a more normal movespeed to you."

You don't get to LE by bashing your head against the keyboard, which is what the majority of the DB playerbase seems to do. You need to have at least basic map awareness and learn the simplest smokes.  As for what the CS:GO sub thinks about LEs, doesn't it basically go like this?"

Dirtybomb,3divgl,DastardlyCoxcomb,2,Fri Jul 17 07:27:35 2015 UTC,"This game is all about tracking aim. Being able to hold your crosshair on their head for the entire firefight while they strafe and jump about. So, coming from CS is rather difficult because CS is all about twitch aim. I found that Vassili is more conducive to playing like I'm used to in CS:GO because of his low TTK. The problem however, is that you will have to learn to play the other classes if you want to get better at this game. You can't just choose one merc and only play that. Vassili is obviuously only good in long range engagements. If you decide to pick up Vassili, also find 2 others that you are very comfortable playing as. For me, this is Sawbones and Fletcher.  As a side note, never forget about your abilities. When I first started playing, I just used the guns like I would in CS:GO, but this game is in no way the same. If you end up playing Vassili, the heart beat sensor can often be as useful as his sniper.  Edit: I just found out that Kira and Arty's Dreiss AR is absolutely amazing and does about 1/2 health on headshot. I think this is the closest you will get to a twitch aim gun on a most team based merc."
Dirtybomb,3divgl,mtyacorn,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:22:29 2015 UTC,"You have no idea what you're talking about if you think that CS:GO players don't know how to track and that CS:GO is all about twitch aiming. Someone playing at his level not only has to be able to track, but do so while executing a specific spray pattern dependent upon the gun he is using while he's doing so. His aim alone will put him at the top of the scoreboard no matter what class he plays in the average pub."
Dirtybomb,3divgl,stevenmcqueen,2,Thu Jul 16 20:03:42 2015 UTC,"So, just to clarify, are you're telling me the most important things about aiming in CS:GO isn't crosshair placement and having twitch reflexes to adjust it when someone comes into view? Also, are you telling me that the TTK at high levels of CS:GO play are so high that you need to spray for more than 1 second?  Damn, if that's true, then all of the pro teams seem to be looking at things wrong. They should all listen to you.  Oh, and I encourage anyone who thinks /u/stevenmcqueen has a point to look at his account. It is filled with comments that are just plain degrading, and I don't think much stock should be put into his words."
Dirtybomb,3divgl,mtyacorn,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:45:24 2015 UTC,"Fragger and the support crew (Kira, Arty, Skyhammer) typically follow the CS formula of going for headshots and peeking corners effectively. I run my sens a tad higher in DB than I do in CS just because there's more close quarters combat in DB, usually between 6-7 sens at 800 dpi and 6/11 windows setting is good for both knife fights and nailing headshots."
Dirtybomb,3divgl,Llebac,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:06:34 2015 UTC,"AD strafing works pretty well in pubs, but unlike csgo you don't lose that much accuracy while moving.  Longjumping is key if you want early picks at the start of a round. This is achieved by holding shift, crouching and then jumping. This jump can also be used to bounce off walls, and some trick jumps require this.  Don't use ads. In fact, unbind m2- unless you plan to play Vassili.  There is a slight spray pattern for each gun, but I don't think it's very noticeable. Use this fact to your advantage however you want.  Don't be harsh if you don't hit shots at first. At csgo, the game is all momentum. The same is applied here as well, but momentum comes rushing at you like a thrown brick. Develop muscle memory and practice to get good, there are no shortcuts (unless you download then dirty cheats)."
Dirtybomb,3divgl,kirenasura,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:09:01 2015 UTC,"Well, if you are a LE in CS:GO you are most likely already better than 99.5% of Dirty Bomb players aim-wise. DB has almost no recoil and you don't need to worry about CoF movement control unlike in CS, just the miniscule CoF expansion(which translates into bursting every 15 or so shots), so stay mobile. Only thing that messes up CoF real bad is jumping and even then it's nothing compared to the cone of fire expansion you get in CS.  Skyhammer is extremely good. Best fire support merc, basically. Airstrike is invaluable for area denial/taking out EVs and even works as a grenade indoors. The default M4 is considered by many to be the best gun, Timik47 has better RoF in exchange for some accuracy and BR-16 absolutely destroys if you can stay accurate, but has limited ammo capacity.  You can still(I believe?) get a free fragger merc(search this sub). He is slightly slower than Skyhammer, but has more health and very strong frag grenades. He starts with a LMG but you can get the M4 and BR16 if you want to stay somewhat mobile. He is currently in the free rotation, although if that free offer is still available, just go and do it.  For Medic, Sawbonez is the most classic shootmans guy. For Engineer it's Bushwhacker."

Dirtybomb,3di9a9,Wraithial,8,Thu Jul 16 14:21:38 2015 UTC,"He's definitely a situational class. In CQC, Rhino with his minigun should be able to kill any other merc in a head-on engagement. Sit in a hallway or other choke point (such as inside the Blocker Carriage) where you can't be attacked at range, preferably with a medic behind you to heal you and watch your flanks. Keep your minigun spun up by holding right-click and wait for the enemies to come to you.  Your greatest threats are mercs with indirect damage, and mercs that can engage at range. Rhino's only ranged weapon is his pistol. As such, you should make sure that you can't be attacked at range. Unfortunately the only way to do this is to avoid certain parts of the maps. And make sure you watch out for Fraggers and Naders. If they hear your minigun, you'll have nades coming your way before you even know what's happening and you won't be able to shoot their source because it'll be around a corner."

Dirtybomb,3di9a9,Mattiassch,4,Thu Jul 16 16:28:15 2015 UTC,"The best tip I can give that seems really counter-intuitive is to pretend that you're a much lighter/faster merc. I play an extremely mobile Rhino and I can't tell you how many people I catch off guard by doing a long jump into wall jump around a corner while revving my minigun as I start to land. I have my knife out probably 3/4 of the time that I'm playing, and I honestly never feel like he's 'slow' until I play someone with much faster MS.   Rhinos that sit in one spot are extremely predictable. You have a fucking mobile MG that puts the mounted ones to shame in terms of DPS at close range. The key part is to actually be mobile and do your best to always be on the move, keeping the opponents constantly guessing whether or not you're sitting around the corner that they're about to round. I've had some ridiculous rounds with Rhino playing this way (80+ kills / ~20 deaths in a 6v6 Stopwatch), and it's much more difficult to counter your 'weakness' (extremely slow mobility while revving the MG) when you're only revving the gun ~10-15% of the time that you're actually playing.   Everyone thinks Rhino plays best as a giant tank that sits next to an Aura station. What that actually does is scream out to the opposing team ""SWITCH TO FRAGGER AND GET A FREE DOUBLE/TRIPLE KILL!!"" Rhino is far, far more terrifying when he's constantly on the move, lurking at every corner and ready to mow down the entire push you have lined up at a choke point."

Dirtybomb,3di9a9,Duranous,2,Thu Jul 16 14:25:25 2015 UTC,Positioning is everything! You are useless in anything further than close to medium distance. Keep a chokepoint on lockdown when on defense and be the first guy to take the fire on offense.  Also ask an Aura on your team for support. You can easily tank 300+ damage without going down that way.

It will lock the opponent down in the corner, forcing them to sit there and wait for their doom. If they attempt to run through your burst then they'll take damage and be easier to kill while running away, this will also prevent them from strafing back and fourth and taking pot shots at you while you round the corner.   Also, be aware that you can shoot through glass."
Dirtybomb,3di9a9,SowakaWaka,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:52:08 2015 UTC,If you have the chances always defend on bridge. A team with a rhino should never let the team past the first stage.

Dirtybomb,3di9a9,feench,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:17:37 2015 UTC,"Get the Nitros perk. It's his best loadout because it helps you stay mobile and makes you able to rev up while jumping around corners and surprising people. It works wonders.   The key to win is to stay mobile and not give up your location. If people hear you rev up they will just corner-edge you. But if you surprise them with jumping and reving up in the air, they can't escape before dying. So long-jump and rev up and don't forget that you run fast with the melee weapon and that you can walljump. Positioning is key! If you take damage from long range, just back out. You can't do shit at long range unless you have godlike aim with the revolver. So fight your battles at flanks and close range."

I fond people miatly try to use him to W MB1 towards enemies like a Heavy in TF2, but Rhino is comparitively squishier than the Heavy. Flank, jump-spin around corners, and look to play Defense with Rhino. He can still be REALLY good on offense, but requires much more map knowlege and flanking to be helpful. Last but not least, if your bottoming the scoreboard, swap classes. Its okay, Rhino is easily counterable if the enemy pays attention.

This should be simple to set up and teaches them about how to use the gun and let them know it works offensively too."

I've read all the abilitys, they've never talked about charging to revive. The secondary objectives are very unclear when you're just starting out. Nothing ever tells you that you can shoot at generators to kill them.  On top of that it's never explains what each secondary objective does and how it helps or hurts. And the indicators for health/ ammo pickups, and objectives are so piss poor that half the time after a couple hundred hours in game, even I don't always see them."

In my case though I was a Nader trying to revive the Proxy so she could disarm much faster than I could. I'd hover over the Proxy and it'd start disarming the C4, I move back just a bit and then I could stat the revive.  Another problem is when you're defusing or arming stuff and your ""team"" decides it'd be helpful to try and do the same thing right on top of you.  Protip, if you're going to be a meat shield don't do it directly on top of your teammate.  You just make it easier for explosives to kill you both."

Dirtybomb,3dfvi3,eeyore134,4,Thu Jul 16 03:26:03 2015 UTC,I revive everyone I can no matter what as Sparks.  Even if you die again it's a distraction for the other team and you might get lucky and find cover or get some shots off.  Not to mention as Sparks it's such a quick thing that it becomes second nature and if I start thinking about everyone I zap then I'll stop being as efficient.  If you don't want me to raise you in a hail of bullets you need to release.
Dirtybomb,3dfvi3,Galphor,1 point,Thu Jul 16 05:07:20 2015 UTC,"maybe I want to be revived after the fire fight is over cause the spawn is 15 seconds away, maybe I'm playing nader and am waiting for a chance to use my martydom. but i guess none of that matters I'm just suppose to instantly release and wait in boredom until the spawn"
Dirtybomb,3dfvi3,eeyore134,1 point,Thu Jul 16 05:27:06 2015 UTC,"If you're in a hail of bullets, though, I have about a second to get you up before they knock you out completely.  Not saying you have to release, but if someone rezzes you then you can't complain.  That's what we're there for."
Dirtybomb,3dfvi3,Galphor,1 point,Thu Jul 16 07:01:58 2015 UTC,"honestly I would rather they shoot me to death than have the medic come out and risk death, and then we are a double target which means some explosions coming our way as well."
Dirtybomb,3dfvi3,eeyore134,2,Fri Jul 17 04:14:10 2015 UTC,"That's the beauty of Sparks, you can raise folks from relative safety most of the time.  As Aura or someone like that I wouldn't run out into fire like that."
Dirtybomb,3dfvi3,Galphor,1 point,Fri Jul 17 05:57:14 2015 UTC,"but most sparks seem fine with reviving me in that situation, when they wouldn't be caught dead in that situation, thats why they piss me off. cause to them its just exp, to me its another death, sometimes if its right on the spawn timer, I have to wait for the full spawn timer cycle"
Dirtybomb,3dfvi3,pnellesen,1 point,Fri Jul 17 06:07:24 2015 UTC,"Nah, to me it's trying to get someone back up and in the fight without them having to run from spawn.  It can really turn a battle and, again, at least distract the enemies.  Not only do they have to kill you again, but they realize there's a healer they need to focus on taking out.  Tapping out really does seem like the best option for avoiding unwanted revives.  There's not really time to ask if someone wants to be back up or not."

Dirtybomb,3dinrn,DOGpls,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:19:24 2015 UTC,"Generally, you should have an assault or fire support class, a medic and an objective specialist in your squad. The best assault and fire support mercs (Fragger and Skyhammer) are free and Sawbonez and Bushwhacker are the best medic and objective specialist. AND buying the package leaves you with $4 change to spend on something else.  Buy the deployables package."
Dirtybomb,3dinrn,LLAMATARIANISM,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:25:18 2015 UTC,How does saw Sawbonez compare to Aura?
Dirtybomb,3dinrn,savanu,2,Thu Jul 16 21:36:48 2015 UTC,"Aura is mediocre at best. She's good in pubs if you pair her with a Rhino, but she has to avoid head-on contact because she's so squishy and other than her pistols and the awful Blishlok, she has no ability to engage at range. Sawbonez has more HP and the Crotzni, and medpacks are much better offensively while still being effective defensively. In a Dirty Cups tournament, you're going to see far more Sawbonez than Auras."
Dirtybomb,3dinrn,LLAMATARIANISM,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:41:14 2015 UTC,"How many medpacks can sawbones hold, and how quickly do they recharge? Also, I was going to buy sparks soon, would you recommend sawbones over sparks?"
Dirtybomb,3dinrn,celsius032,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:05:01 2015 UTC,"I believe he can hold 4 with either a 3s or 5s cooldown for each one? Don't quote me on that, just off the top of my head.  I think Sawbonez and Sparks both have their merits. Do you play to win? Do you like competitive matches? Get Sawbonez, because he's far more effective all around. Do you play to have fun? Do you like pubs? Maybe get Sparks. She's not as solid as Sawbonez, not even close, but she's quite a unique experience compared to most mercs and she can be a lot of fun if you don't mind losing a bit more. It's the same case as Fragger vs Nader."
Dirtybomb,3dinrn,LLAMATARIANISM,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:43:41 2015 UTC,"Honestly I would grab Nader (As she's amazing for control on objectives for both sides) and maybe looking into Bushwhacker or Rhino. Alternatively, if you're looking for competitive play, I would look at the Bronze loadout cards that you can buy (they're around 3.20ish each) and their perks are amazing if you don't much care for cosmetic differences."

Dirtybomb,3dky5h,SquirmyBurrito,8,Fri Jul 17 02:47:54 2015 UTC,"It's good that you are trying to clear misconceptions, but you aren't including additional details and context that make Phantom OP.  1.Phantom is almost running with his katana out, which allows him to move much more quickly. Other than running back to battle after spawning, most players almost always have their guns out. This causes a large discrepancy in movement speed. Players could always switch to their melee and run, but that takes time and even if you avoid his melee he'll gun you down in the back with the best smg in the game. Additionally, having to switch to melee, turn around, and run away, is not a good counter strategy in terms of gameplay. He can also close distances much more easily due to his cloak.  2.He has above average health as a base. He also gains a MASSIVE amount of survivability and effective health from his refractive armor. His cloak is on a very short cooldown, which allows him to have this additional tankiness almost constantly. Not to mention this is BETTER than simply higher health, because it can negate heavy damage like sniper headshots and explosives. He can also cloak pretty much instantly.  3.He can 1 shot many mercs, which is bullshit anyways and because he can do it directly out of stealth. Just because he can't 1 shot a majority, doesn't mean it's any less bullshit. Instantly dieing from an invisible player is frustrating and requires little skill. Additionally, if a Phantom closes the distances and DOES land a lunge, he can quickly follow up with another quick slice. Not a 1 shot, but still an incredibly fast kill that little can be done against. The katana also has a large hitbox capable of skewering multiple targets, and can be turned mid attack. As I said, he is far more effective at melee because he can close distances much more easily due to his cloak."
Dirtybomb,3dky5h,negbot1,3,Fri Jul 17 03:03:27 2015 UTC,"For your third arguement, phantom cannot one shot most classes. A good amount of the classes however CAN one shot MORE classes many of them gibbing. Most from range."
Dirtybomb,3dky5h,Alphadef,2,Fri Jul 17 14:09:57 2015 UTC,Regarding #3 if he couldn't insta kill squishy mercs out of cloak he would be pointless. Isn't that the whole original intention of the merc?
Dirtybomb,3dky5h,BillNyeTheScience,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:54:53 2015 UTC,He should at least have to uncloak before attacking. Similar to how he can't fire from cloak.
Dirtybomb,3dky5h,negbot1,0,Fri Jul 17 23:27:24 2015 UTC,"That's because I wasn't trying to make this thread about whether or not he is OP. This was supposed to be purely informative. 1. Every character can run with their melee out. Running with your melee weapon out doesn't give you extra speed, it just gives you access to 100% of your sprint speed. 2. He gains what, 75 health from his cloak? That then steadily decreases overtime, faster when sprinting, immediately disappears when he performs an action, and (of course) is decreased by taking damage. Also comes with a damage gate. He cannot cloak instantly, the cloak animation is moderately lengthy. 3. He only oneshots 4-5 mercs, the mercs that are squishy and are already oneshotted by shotgun headshots (and/or were oneshotted by the pre-nerf stiletto). Did you consider squishy targets being oneshottable with by melee bullshit prior to Phantom's release? I'm not going to get into the incredibly subjective skill argument. That is a discussion for another thread. Other melee weapons can also skewer multiple targets and can be turned mid-attack. Many of your complaints aren't katana specific."
Dirtybomb,3dky5h,Closet_Indie,2,Fri Jul 17 03:28:38 2015 UTC,The cloak health allows him to get in melee range without taking any damage thus giving a shit ton of effective health when the enemy spend half their clip pouring shots into while he was running at their face. He can now either stab them with a katana (Which has a huuuuuge hitbox compared to other weapons so saying other melee weapons can also skewer multiple targets isn't really a fair comparison) or if he's even smarter can simply pull out his kek-10 and proceed to dominate them because he has a full clip and they have almost nothing left after trying to break his shield.
Dirtybomb,3dky5h,Closet_Indie,0,Sat Jul 18 01:14:12 2015 UTC,"That depends entirely upon which weapon you're using and how many of your shots you land. The weakest weapon (in terms of damage per bullet) will drop his cloak in 9 shots, fewer if you land headshots. This assumes his cloak is at full duration. If he attacks, you're now engaged in a firefight with him, in which case its your job to outgun him."
Dirtybomb,3dky5h,Closet_Indie,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:25:49 2015 UTC,"Even if you land every bullet (which you won't) that still leaves you with no counterplay other than to try and outgun a merc who has 120 hp, is in optimal range to use the best smg in the game and has a full clip. I'm not saying it can't be done, I'm saying it's imbalanced because he always has the odds stacked in his favor even by simply running straight at your face cloaked. He should have to try and flank to gain such a massive advantage but right now he can just leeroy jenkins himself at your face and still have the upper hand."

Enough for people to realize that they died because they were standing in the wrong place at the wrong time. With that knowledge they can improve their game.

If you can't tough it out for two weeks this probably isn't the game for you anyway... as a matter of fact any game the releases new characters (new characters are usually over/under powered for the first couple weeks) or in beta isn't for you. In fact most games have characters stronger then others and cheaters... so many there's no game for you. Go play chess, its always a fair match."

Dirtybomb,3dhnod,Th3_5n0wman,4,Thu Jul 16 10:20:38 2015 UTC,"Your sticky bombs are your primary weapon. Press '4' to swap to them and run around with them in your hand. This allows you to throw them down faster and also boosts your move speed as if you were carrying a melee weapon.  While the bombs can be used to set traps, they are far more versatile than that. Aim to throw them and detonate them just as they reach their target. Don't give people time to react. You can also shoot them in mid-air and detonate them that way. In addition, they stick to enemies, and can instantly kill some mercs, such as Aura or Proxy. For added fun, stick a couple to an unwary enemy and detonate them when they are close to their teammates.  You want to keep moving around. Jump off walls, dodge in and out of cover, all the while throwing and detonating bombs at enemies. Do remember however that they can be shot as they leave your hand, which can seriously injure you.  If you ARE going to use them for a trap, such as defending an objective, try to hide them as best you can. Also remember that they don't vanish when you die, meaning you can still defend an objective even if you've just spawned, provided you've already set the trap.  As for your other weapons, the Ahnuhld-12 has quite a long range and reasonable damage. Use it to finish off enemies. A one-two combo of a well placed sticky and then a shotgun blast to the face can very quickly dispatch many mercs. The Empire-9 is quite potent too, and often better than your shotgun. Alternatively, you may want to get a loadout with a Blishlok if you don't mind it.  Fletcher is also very good at wrecking other Engineer's deployables. Throwing a sticky on a seemingly safe bomb site can destroy mines or other stickies, or a couple can be used to remove a health station or sentry turret.  As with every Engineer, Fletcher repairs, plants and defuses far quicker than non-Engineer classes. Know what objectives and side objectives there are."
Dirtybomb,3dhnod,Wilcolt,1 point,Thu Jul 16 10:35:23 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I'll try to take your advice next time. I do sometimes get killed while running with my sticky bombs out, should I be trying to keep more distance from the fray?"
Dirtybomb,3dhnod,Wilcolt,1 point,Thu Jul 16 10:38:34 2015 UTC,"You need to be close enough to accurately hit targets with them, but try to stay out of line of sight. Fletcher has very high burst damage capabilities."
Dirtybomb,3dhnod,Wilcolt,2,Thu Jul 16 10:40:32 2015 UTC,So try to sneak up behind them?
Dirtybomb,3dhnod,HollowExistence,2,Thu Jul 16 11:09:16 2015 UTC,Flanking targets is pretty much always a good idea. You just want to pop in and out of cover and throw your stickies over and around objects. You can kill people without being able to see them.
Dirtybomb,3dhnod,Wilcolt,1 point,Thu Jul 16 11:14:56 2015 UTC,Alright. While I don't feel like I'm having much success I'll keep at it
Dirtybomb,3dhnod,TwoThreeSkidoo,3,Thu Jul 16 11:30:51 2015 UTC,"Play him like a bushwacker / nader mix  Focus objectives and use the stickies like slower nades and clear aura stations.   Mainly use the empire, treat the shotgun as your secondary. Or blishlock away. Blish is a good gun.   Of you get a bit better you can quickly peek n throw and detonate later. Works quite well. Afterwards the enemies are softened up and just empire em.  Don't make the mistake to use stickies as traps. The trigger time is too slow. It only works well when you trap key points or you have a good knowledge when and where someone will be. Anything else and you'll die."
Dirtybomb,3dhnod,TwoThreeSkidoo,1 point,Thu Jul 16 11:40:30 2015 UTC,Alright. Maybe I'll try the blishlok. I was really just using the Ahnuhld coz it looked cool and thought Fletcher would be better up close.

Anything that is not 100% without a doubt cosmetic addition for the game should not cost real money in my opinion. Not to mention it gives the developer incentive to release broken content that is only available to those who have saved up enough in game currency to buy it right off or those who spend money on it right off and then patch it 2 or 3 weeks later.

Dirtybomb,3de0zf,caitsith01,2,Wed Jul 15 20:09:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah spawn killing in general isn't that great. I think BF3/4 had a reasonable concept of the 'no go zone' that would auto kill you after a few seconds if you didn't turn back.  Also the Australian FPSG servers for BF4 have an 'auto nuke' function that if the server (somehow) detects base raping, it will kill the entire other team. Might not work that well for a fast paced competitive game like DB, but an interesting concept nonetheless.  Personally I just like the idea of physically inaccessible areas that teams spawn in (so the enemy can't reach them) with multiple exits (so you can at least try and flank or out maneuver a spawn camping team). Ideally this would stop people from just jumping on Nader and lob nades into the area. So it's basically a map design issue IMHO.  Lastly I think proper team balancing would be great to stop all of this happening in the first place. First (and only) competitive match I played pitted a bunch of level 3 - 7s (my team) against level 15 - 25s who had a few more mercs unlocked than we had, and it was just a horrible match (on terminal, didn't even set the first c4 once). I realise we're a bunch of noobs, but some balance would appreciated.   Don't want to just bitch though, Dirty Bomb is awesome, definitely best F2P FPS I've ever played, really enjoying it too."

Aside from that I don't think there's anything wrong with spawnkilling. It's part of the game, and if you're getting completely annihilated in your spawn then chances are additional spawnkill prevention would make no difference to the outcome as the enemy team is obviously significantly better than yours."
Dirtybomb,3de0zf,ElementB,5,Wed Jul 15 15:26:36 2015 UTC,"Ehhhh, even if it didn't change the overall outcome it'd stop people from leaving the game and reduce the number of enemies bum rushing straight into the enemy spawn zone, it'd make for a more enjoyable game experience and make being spawncamped significantly less miserable.   The other day I joined a game with two Rhinos and a turret spawn camping... It killed the server, everyone on the side I joined left and eventually the enemy team started leaving. There's plenty of ways to help prevent this, even if it's just in the form of invulnerability until they leave a certain radius of where they stood when spawned. Would it change the outcome? No. But it would have kept the server alive and wouldn't have frustrated 7 players on one side and bored the other players on the other side enough to leave. That can't be healthy for the game."

Dirtybomb,3deqzl,Dworgi,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:24:11 2015 UTC,"I mean, kind of?   RtcW did popularize the game mode pretty heavily, and W:ET more or less perfected it.

Dirtybomb,3dh8n1,Hufnagel,2,Thu Jul 16 21:14:23 2015 UTC,I find her pretty balanced. It's very easy to notice (visually / sound) and it doesn't last very long. You can even outrun it by just leaping around or kill her asap if it's going for someone else.  Cooldown seems fine
Dirtybomb,3dh8n1,INI_Fourzero,2,Thu Jul 16 07:23:18 2015 UTC,"Playing her for 20+ hours and trying a lot of different loadout kits with her, she's balanced.

Dirtybomb,3ddpgq,7supersonicfan,11,Wed Jul 15 17:01:20 2015 UTC,"competitive edge vs cinematic experience   Perhaps in this case, but sometimes it's also about realistic vs. cinematic.  Many video options -- such as lens-flares, [crosshair-controlled] depth-of-field, or what some games call ""HDR"" -- are attempts to mimic design flaws in video cameras. Almost none of them are things the player would actually experience if they were teleported into the fantasy. It just sells more copies to the generation(s) who were unconsciously raised to expect those unnatural quirks and to associate them with other successful products, like movies and TV shows."
Dirtybomb,3ddpgq,PowerfulTaxMachine,4,Wed Jul 15 17:04:54 2015 UTC,"Depth of field is something your eyes do. You would absolutely experience it if you were teleported into the fantasy. Try closing one eye, holding a finger in front of you, and focusing on the finger. Everything in the background will be blurry.   Not saying DoF would be a good thing in games or DB specifically - I kinda hate it, myself. But it isn't something purely mimicking a camera (like lens flare), it's a phenomenon your eyes display as well."
Dirtybomb,3ddpgq,Blittzzo,4,Wed Jul 15 19:04:14 2015 UTC,"Depth of field is something your eyes do.    But not in video games, where it is something your gun/crosshair does! The visuals may be similar, but the interactivity is entirely different. What would you do if your eyes suddenly stopped focusing, except on things that you pointed to with your finger? Totally unnatural and frustrating. I'd probably snap within a week.  So if you're seeking realism, you should always disable Depth of Field. DoF in games is going to continue to suck until someone comes up with a common set of hardware for games to instantly know what part of the monitor your real-world-eyeballs are aimed at.   You would absolutely experience it if you were teleported into the fantasy.   Real DoF is always happening, but you seldom experience it in the real world, because you instinctively look at things you want to pay attention to, which brings them into focus, and it's all very natural, fast, and unconscious. Actually noticing it usually requires something extremely close to your face, or conscious effort.  __  P.S.: A lot of this also applies to ""High Dynamic Range"". Many of the games that use the term are actually working to recreate the flaws of a video-camera whose dynamic range is too low for the game-world. Even the games that try to do it right are crippled by the lack of gaze-tracking."

There were a number of interesting fixed suggested, including:   removing the shield from his cloak splitting shield and cloak into two different abilities that use the same energy pool giving the shield damage reduction instead of flat absorbtion swapping SMGs for Machine Pistols, Sparks style lowering his base HP finally nerfing the KEK-10 or making the other SMGs equally strong"
Dirtybomb,3djvsy,Stuhlgewitter,2,Thu Jul 16 21:32:52 2015 UTC,Problem is that the KEK-10 is difficult to nerf without making it completely obsolete. Nerf its DPS and you've got the Hochfir. Increase its recoil and spread and you've got the Crotzni.

Visual aids definitely something I'll be implementing in the next video in the series.   I probably won't get super into detail with statistics like range and gun comparisons tbh, just because its a bit too specific.   I'll try speak more clearly as well, that sounds like a pretty realistic goal. Thanks!"

You can just W+M1 directly into a crowd of enemies and mash the button like a laboratory chimp with electrodes in it's brain. That's only fun if you're a total wanker. If you play the objective he's next to unstoppable. Luckily however, most people who still play Phantom are, as mentioned before, wankers. They wouldn't know an objective if it took a shit in their mouths.  I swapped him out for Sawbones. Nobody hates Sawbones. It's nice.  edit: Downvoted huh?

Dirtybomb,3dhg3h,mackejn,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:15:43 2015 UTC,Blishlok is an amazing gun if you're able to consistently land shots.  Sticky bombs have super fast recharge rate compared to other explosives and with Quick Draw you can constantly dump out stickies into positions the enemy is holding with a healing station or turret (2 stickies take out any deployable).  110 HP combined with a faster than average move speed makes for an extremely viable merc that's underutilized.
Dirtybomb,3dhg3h,BeardyDuck,3,Thu Jul 16 23:06:56 2015 UTC,shotguns are kinda meh and stickies are clunky  if shotguns are made more consistent* and stickies slightly faster (lock on perk will help with that) he goes from mediocre to solid merc

Dirtybomb,3dix12,megaroop,5,Thu Jul 16 17:15:21 2015 UTC,"I bought Phantom yesterday and, I've gotta say, he's not completely overpowered, he's terrible at doing objectives and while he can kill multiple people with just his melee, he's incredibly weak to actually getting shot at by a number of people."
Dirtybomb,3dix12,Kazzei,-3,Thu Jul 16 17:29:01 2015 UTC,"Sure, Phantom can't directly do objectives. But with the extra 75+ HP (technically it can be more than 75 HP because overkilling the cloak won't damage his HP, only his cloak) from the cloak that regenerates in just 5 seconds, he makes a great human shield.  And with anywhere between 120 and 195 HP, he's a lot less weak to being shot by a number of people than most mercs. Especially since aimpunch doesn't really matter on melee weapons.  I also don't think he's completely OP, because you wouldn't use Phantom every time. He's bad in competitive and can't complete objectives faster than other mercs, or revive, or give ammo, so you still need engis, medics and fire supports. He wouldn't classify as completely OP unless he made all the other classes unviable, the way that the Plasma Rifle in T:A made all other weapons unviable. But he's definitely OP."
Dirtybomb,3dix12,LLAMATARIANISM,2,Thu Jul 16 17:48:22 2015 UTC,"Oh for sure, I wouldn't even class him as a Recon. He's the best assault in the game except for Fragger, in my opinion. He's definitely OP."

At first no one knows how to deal with him/her and they rule the map and then people get used and know what to expect and it settles down. Sure, phantom could do with a little Nerf, but only the best players of him can really rule a match.   (at least he won't do well when I'm gunning him down :)))))"

Dirtybomb,3dekrm,themilanguy1,4,Fri Jul 17 08:33:48 2015 UTC,"Make sure you're not dodging AND trying to reposition your crosshairs when you're in a duel, keep your crosshair in the general vicinity and let your movement do the repositioning. Also don't spam your shots as soon as the cooldown in between shots is over, time your shots and shoot only when you have your crosshair over their body."
Dirtybomb,3dekrm,BeardyDuck,10,Wed Jul 15 17:57:08 2015 UTC,let your movement do the repositioning   I have been specifically and repeatedly told not to do this by a number of people whose skill at shooters I respect greatly. The logic is that this is a bad habit and a crutch that will get you killed against someone who has learned to aim independent of their movement and can therefor hit you any time you are within range/LOS without relying on position.  The rest of your post I agree with completely.
Dirtybomb,3dekrm,Hyginos,2,Wed Jul 15 19:31:31 2015 UTC,"It's a sensitivity thing. With low sens you use your arm to look in the direction you want to be looking, and then your wrist to narrow down (aim) where you want your xhair to be while shooting.    With shotguns it can help to do the first step, look where you want to be looking with your arm, then use your movement/positioning instead of your wrist for the aiming like Beardy said above. It's not tracking like you'd do with an smg, you have to practice quickly analyzing strafe/movement patterns and have a good idea of where someone is going to move during your fight (the next few seconds after engaging), and ideally engage them in a way where few options will be available to them.    Think of twitch aiming as a back-up for if this isn't going to work in some situations.    What is your sens? I think something like at least 6-8""/360 is basically the minimum required"
Dirtybomb,3dekrm,xCanucck,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:44:21 2015 UTC,"Of course. I'm just saying, unless you're consistently dropping 40+ kills each and every match and you're playing at a top level, it's much better to have 1 doing the work without moving much of the other, otherwise your aim will be all over the place and you won't land shots."
Dirtybomb,3dekrm,BeardyDuck,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:52:36 2015 UTC,"They're right but it's fairly top-tier advice, it's definitely a crutch but most people just aren't capable of moving their mouse and character so competently. Most people should just do what works best for them and I think most people would see some positive results if they used their movement to assist with aiming."
Dirtybomb,3dekrm,SowakaWaka,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:45:29 2015 UTC,"Letting your strafe aid your aim is definitely a tool you can use though.  Here's a tutorial from one of the best scouts in competitive TF2 talking about landing shots in scout duels: https://youtu.be/svCmXhYxMGc?t=1m32s  He basically says that lining up your movement with your opponent will make it easier for your mouse-aim to zero in on the target.  Granted, strafing and jumping aren't nearly as good in this game as they are for the Scout, but I think the same benefits come from using your movement to help you aim."

Dirtybomb,3dekrm,Aaronerous,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:14:44 2015 UTC,"Don't rush. Take your time. Land your shots. It is better to take the extra fraction of a sec to aim properly, as you can one-shot many mercs with a shotgun blast to the neck/head area. And especially with aimpunch, you can disorient or scare the tits out of your opponent with your first major blast, in the event that it doesn't kill them. As always, try to make sure you are running around the map with your gun at head level, and don't round corners with your knife out.  You may already know this, so it may be advice better suited for beginners. But when I first started playing, I tried to lay down the law by spamming with a shotgun similar to how I would with an auto (or even with pistols). Did not work. The damage-to-attack-speed ratio is so high that aim > spray."

Also if you feel like you got the time aim down sights to tighten the spread, (Only really applies if you are shooting someone about ~12m away). This also applies to revolvers in Dirty Bomb."
Dirtybomb,3dekrm,Renpsy,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:56:42 2015 UTC,"Compared to other FPS games, the shotgun in DB seems to have a much smaller spread, and is effective at a longer range.  As a result you have to be much more accurate with your aiming than you do in other games."

Having access to the Dreiss AR is a big deal,     Huh? Fraggers, medics, and phantoms all don't have the dreiss, so I'm not sure what this is meant to mean."

Dirtybomb,3ddeaj,SgtTittyfist,2,Wed Jul 15 17:50:47 2015 UTC,"The BR-16 is pretty good at long range. A BR armed fragger will be able to deal with any merc at distance easily. Unfortunately, the BR-16 doesn't complement the close ranged nature of his grenades, making the M4 and LMG loadouts with good perks preferred."
Dirtybomb,3ddeaj,BearPawsOG,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:03:45 2015 UTC,"Honestly, the BR-16 just has way too much spread increase per shot and it has the smallest mag. It's probably my least favorite AR in the entire game.  Also the M4A1 does the same damage IIRC, so why bother limiting your output of bullets?"
Dirtybomb,3ddeaj,BigDrakow,7,Wed Jul 15 20:56:11 2015 UTC,"Well, not sure how to put this... You are mostly right and I love how cautious you are looking at this problem. Also I love how you didn't offer any solutions which is perfectly alright, SD should decide about concept and balance changes to the game. That said, we shouldn't urge them to change Phantom for a lot of reasons, the most important one is we don't know what will be 'the final picture', how the game is going to look like after all 20 of the mercs have been released.     Phantom does hurt the game in certain segments of the player population, no doubt about it, but that's happening now, in the current game state, which is still very fluid. Phantom will most certainly be changed and the whole game even more so. Also, historically, backstabbing was present in all SD games so far. Most of your points about Phantom could be applied to Vassili too, in fact all of them except competitive (and even that remains to be seen): challenging, competent, co-ordination, fast-paced (slows the game), fun (not so much for the other side), hard-core, lone wolf, skillful.     My point is we should wait for the free rotation that include Phantom to be over, and for the patch right after that. By that time most of the problems with this merc will be part of the DB history."
Dirtybomb,3ddeaj,BearPawsOG,4,Wed Jul 15 13:59:43 2015 UTC,"Hey, thanks for the thought-out response.   I think Vasili is somewhat different in that he requires a team to be properly coordinated to use him effectively, and he has obvious weaknesses, and natural counter-strategies (Rush-down, needs to hit headshots, sniper vs sniper). I do think he does require skill for him to be effective, it's one thing to hit one out of every four, to five, shots, (lets say 20-25%) but those players can be easily revived by a medic, so he has to hit head shots, which isn't that easy. Vasili might not be fun, but I think he does add an interesting element to a team, which, I think, is most effectively used playing with his team, via a support fire, scouting, and of-course fragging. Is Vasili hardcore? That's a good question.  I think you're right with respect to the ""wait, and see"" approach, however, I think it's interesting that by almost every publically stated standard of Splash Damage, Phantom fails to meet any of them."
Dirtybomb,3ddeaj,BigDrakow,5,Wed Jul 15 14:33:38 2015 UTC,"If they don't fix Phantom before putting him in rotation, this game is toast. The idea that we don't have the whole picture doesn't work in this kind of game where the community is everything. If you lose a big chunk of player base now you won't get it back later, they will move to another game. They don't seem to peek over 11k concurrent players already, they are risking a lot. I am finding myself being more frustrated with each game. I see this damn merc, unload almost a full magazing with fragger on him and die with 2 swings anyway because once you hear him, he is already too close to be dealt with in time. Vassili is not the same because he requires aim and not everyone has it. He stays way behind his teammates and you can always move to become a worse target. More than everything he can be spotted and flanked quite quickly. SD doesn't have the luxury of time in this matter, in my opinion they made another one of those mistakes that will lead another game to the tomb. You can't ""unrelease"" phantom anymore so the flow is fucked for good, this game won't be as fast paced as it used to be. I hope I am wrong and they can balance him, but I am not that confident."

They are selling stuff for real money so I can't give them the benefit of the time, maybe the doubt. They call it open beta but they released a merc they knew would make them money before the counterpart. They altered the flow of the game with no regards for how it would hurt the game. Phantom is not a good fit for a fast paced shooter, everybody can see that. Ownership doesn't mean much with a FTP game. What I can see is that they didn't peek over 11k since the phantom update. We will see."

Eg, the sentence in question. What are you really trying to say?   I would like to begin this article by attempting to frame the questions which would be important to what could be a potentially interesting, and hopefully healthy, discussion about “balance” in video-games, and primarily how we come to make qualifications about a particular mechanic working with, or against, the flow of a game.    Ok. So:  To discus balance, we first must address how particular mechanics contribute towards gameplay.  Great, but then you trick the reader. Because the majority of your article is about the definition of balance and the history of Splash Damage. Where are the questions about particular mechanics? Already there's a disconnect.  We have to get right to the end to find out that what you really want to talk about is how movement is used in the game, and whether Phantom is in alignment with Splash Damage gameplay objectives: challenging, competent, competitive, co-ordination (you really mean teamwork), fast-paced, fun, hardcore, lone-wolf (um ok), skilful (or skillful if US).  It might have been more accurate if you had just said:  This article compares Phantom against Splash Damage gameplay objectives and aims to answer the question: Is Phantom balanced?  This would be more accurate because if you read your conclusion, it's all about Phantom and balance. You can downvote this all you like but the mature thing to do would reflect on your article."

Dirtybomb,3ddeaj,SquirmyBurrito,4,Wed Jul 15 13:29:18 2015 UTC,"I don't have time to read it all at work, but there are several obvious errors in that article:   Q3F was actually the most popular Quake 3 total conversion (I don't count minor admin or tweak mods) before the release of Urban Terror, and maintained a dedicated fanbase and competitive scene for quite a long time after. Wolf ET's full title is 'Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory', not 'Return to Castle Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory'. It was never called RtCW:ET. Brink used idtech4, not Unreal.   Something I also didn't see mentioned (but may have missed) is that the personnel at SD changed quite a lot between W:ET, ET:QW and Brink. The majority of the staff who worked on W:ET had actually left before Brink was even announced. A lot of your historical comparison is therefore a bit moot, in my opinion."
Dirtybomb,3ddeaj,SquirmyBurrito,1 point,Wed Jul 15 12:18:45 2015 UTC,"Edit: I fixed the stuff re W:ET, and Brink. Thanks for that.  SD's staff did change, however, their approach, and philosophy to games didn't change as drastically.  With respect to Q3F, it was never as popular as Q3:UrT, which was certainly less popular than CTF/TDM, and it was never really able to reach either one of those mods. Now I would grant there may have been periods where Q3F have been more popular, lets say saying using the metric of clans that played in a league, but it never quite had the same longevity. Q3 TDM/CTF (Now, QuakeLive) are featured in this year's QuakeCon, and Q3UrT still has active leagues in EU afaik."
Dirtybomb,3ddeaj,SquirmyBurrito,3,Wed Jul 15 12:21:45 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it was definitely less popular than CTF/TDM (which were default game modes for Quake 3, to be fair). It was always going to be, though - it was a niche homage to the Team Fortress mod for Quake (at a time when Valve had already released Team Fortress Classic for Half-Life).   Urban Terror was also always going to be more popular because it was an Action Quake/Counter-Strike style of game, which were more popular in general (CS had far more players than Quake 3 at the time).  My intention was just to counter the claim that it never took off as a competitive game, which suggests that it wasn't fit for that purpose. It did, and was, even if it didn't have thousands of clans playing it (it had somewhere between 80-100 at its peak, on par with other niche-appeal FPS' such as Tribes 2, which was released around the same time).  The reason I mention the SD personnel changes is because the tone of the piece seemed to be casting aspersions on their collective ability as part of its criticism, and I thought it was fair to point out that the people who were responsible for the success of W:ET were not responsible for the failure of Brink."

Dirtybomb,3dcvkt,SgtTittyfist,-2,Wed Jul 15 17:42:47 2015 UTC,"Exactly this, Nexon will never let their in-game transactions to happen outside of their store.

That doesn't mean Nexon can't build in a trading system, but it would likely be pretty costly for the player...

Even if you prefer the M4, Fragger still have the highest HP on any merc, except Rhino. 30 HP more than Skyhammer.  He got 2 grenades, which have higher splash radius than any other grenades.

They're able to stop an attacking charge more effectively than an air-strike or artillery as they give very little warning when well placed.  Learn the timing and arc of the grenades, so you can get them to land at enemies' feet and immediately explode. This part is simply practice.  Experience will tell you where the enemy will be. Play as Fragger more often and you'll learn where to throw your grenades.  As the other comments say, the K-121 has a high damage per round, but you shouldn't hold down fire to use it unless you're suppressing (it has a large magazine for this). Also, he can be used as a light damage tank."

His weapon setup is also amazing, and you are severely underrating the k-121. Skyhammer has airstrikes on a 70 second cooldown while Fragger has grenades on a 2-charge low cooldown.   Fragger is one of the best assault mercs.  Yes, you need to compensate for recoil. If you're far enough from your enemy where recoil or accuracy is a big issue, you're not doing it right. Fragger is at his best when he's at close or mid range; he belongs on the front lines with Rhino."

Dirtybomb,3dcymu,Reaven1911,6,Wed Jul 15 08:33:33 2015 UTC,"A tad more than ridiculous, more like how does someone skew the ability of a front line soldier from just front lines to everything besides medic. Takes and holds objectives like a god. While you tickle him with a normal gun, he can stand there, zip his pants up, put down his whiskey, tuck his kids to bed, and fuck his wife, before he decides to turn around and put 2 grenades in your ass."
Dirtybomb,3dcymu,Xist3nce,2,Wed Jul 15 14:48:04 2015 UTC,"First of all, the damage output on K121 is very much worth it. M4 is self explanatory. And if you are good, you can use the BR16 which is simply awesome. But that's for guns.  As for why use fragger instead of Skyhammer? Well, Skyhammer's airstrike is once per minute and the marker only does scratch damage indoors. Fragger's nades, on the other hand, have 2 charges and one shot everyone except for Rhino I believe, not to mention they have huge splash radius. If you cook your nades they basically give free kills. Fragger is also decently mobile for his tankiness, unlike Rhino, who is very slow indeed."
Dirtybomb,3dcymu,DastardlyCoxcomb,0,Wed Jul 15 11:01:09 2015 UTC,"This is how I look at the Skyhammer vs. Fragger choice, the map.  If I'm going to be doing a lot of fighting where there's limited airstrike capability I'll pick Fragger.  Skyhammer's airstrike is great for hurting a defending team or the EV.  Fragger is good if you need to take out people in narrow areas.    Plus Fragger has that extra HP."
Dirtybomb,3dcymu,pockypimp,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:04:37 2015 UTC,"I honestly don't think I've ever been caught by an airstrike that I saw in this game. They take so long to fly in. I don't know the actual numbers but it feels like a full second or more longer than the old ET airstrike. Unless I don't see the canister for some reason, airstrikes are super easy to get away from.   Nobody dodges my nades when I play Fragger. There's not very much room to dodge when they explode 2 feet away from where you are, the instant they reach you."

Dirtybomb,3dcymu,AMasonJar,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:59:49 2015 UTC,"It's really useful for the last point in Cathedral.  When everyone is grouped up either at the building or by the wall of their spawn.  Toss the airstrike while they're distracted and it makes easy work.  It's also pretty good if you can toss them out in front of an area where the enemy is going to come around.  Defending Bridge if you know the enemy and the EV is coming around that corner you can toss the airstrike marker towards the corner of the building.  You sorta have to depend on the AOE.  Fragger is deadly in Underground though, especially in that little hallway where the gate controls are."
Dirtybomb,3dcymu,pockypimp,2,Wed Jul 15 19:04:43 2015 UTC,"If you wanna get good with grenades, cook them. You want your grenades to never hit the ground and stay for more than a second.   For medium range, wait until he puts up his pointer finger (2 seconds) and throw. For long ranges, cook it for one second. It takes practice learning the grenade, but when you do, it'll be great."
Dirtybomb,3dcymu,Shisnos,2,Wed Jul 15 11:31:54 2015 UTC,"You don't really even need to burst fire, at least not in the traditional sense as games like Counterstrike would have you believe. Your SPREAD sets almost-instantly after letting go of the trigger, and your recoil can be entirely controlled by constantly repositioning your crosshair.  The K-121 has 50 bullets in the box, meaning you can hose down entire teams of people before you run out of ammo. This is something that the KEK-10 and the M4A1 struggle with: Put down one or two full-health enemies and you probably need to reload, just as their medics roll in and undo all your hard work. The K-121 hits harder than the other rifles and while it might not actually have the best TTK, it's one of the most ammo-efficient weapons in the game on paper. A lot of people have taken a liking to the M4A1 on Fragger (and for good reason: it's a laser gun), but the K-121 has its merits.  There's one thing in Dirty Bomb that stands above all else: The ability to instagib players without giving them any chance to react. Vasilli (and Sparks) can decapitate people with headshots consistently. The only other class in the game that can boast that is Fragger. A cooked grenade can be thrown such that it detonates right in your enemy's face with no time to react whatsoever. If a Fragger throws one at you and has cooked and placed it correctly, you're dead. There's nothing you can do.  That's HUGE in a game where most fights take a second or two and you have the chance to trade hits and decide whether to commit to the fight or fall back behind cover. When this situation happens to Fragger, if he's getting chased he can start cooking a grenade and simply pitch it in his enemy's face as soon as he busts around the corner (and with 150hp this happens frequently because he's not easy to put down). Fleeing enemies, or teams of players trying to switchout on you (one enemy peeks, takes hits and trades damage, hides and switches out with a fresh teammate to finish you off) die to frag grenades. You clear cramped objectives, aura stations, hallways, and camping spots with frag grenades. You take frag grenades home and cuddle them to sleep because you come to love them so much.  His slower movespeed doesn't make a huge difference when you can murder anyone you see (and those you can't). In stopwatch, the wave timers are synchronized such that you know exactly when the enemy spawns. Cook your grenade around that time, pitch it at the first corner they're about to turn a few seconds after they spawn and voila. Frags-a-million~"

Dirtybomb,3dcymu,AMasonJar,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:02:55 2015 UTC,"I used to think Fragger was terribly overrated, but after I learned the basics of how/when to use his grenades I changed my mind.

Dirtybomb,3dcymu,DropZeHamma,1 point,Wed Jul 15 12:32:32 2015 UTC,"He's very good on defense.  High HP and does solid damage.  Once you learn to use his grenades, you can start to wreak havoc on the other team because they'll one shot a lot of mercs and have a got AoE.  You can even boost the AoE with some card abilities so it can get even more ridiculous by 10% or so."
Dirtybomb,3dcymu,Drakengard,1 point,Wed Jul 15 12:44:55 2015 UTC,"If you're going to use the K-121 , try to get a card with focus. Frag nades are pretty much key if you're going to try to play fragger, so get good at timing the explosion and if you're not getting at least one kill with a nade then you're using them wrong. You also get 150hp vs 120hp with Skyhammer if I'm not mistaken. I prefer the M4 fragger, but with the new aim punch amount, the K-121 could be arguably a better route to go."
Dirtybomb,3dcymu,noisuf,1 point,Wed Jul 15 12:50:11 2015 UTC,"I use Fragger over Skyhammer because of how awesome fragger is as an assault class. Sure, Skydonger has ammo packs and an airstrike; but the airstrike is on the longest cooldown known to man. A well placed fragger grenade can do as much to enemies as a single Skyhammer strike. Fragger also has an ass-ton of health, and very heavy hitting default weapon if you decide to learn how to use it. You'll find that with a combination of well-cooked grenades and burst fire headshots, you can easily wipe an enemy team in one go."
Dirtybomb,3dcymu,Llebac,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:17:14 2015 UTC,I main skyhammer and tried out fragger. I am always out of ammo. Not sure what I'm doing wrong. I feel like he doesn't have enough ammo to get 4+ kills.
Dirtybomb,3dcymu,MK43,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:51:23 2015 UTC,"If you're using the K-121, he doesn't start with very much ammo at all, and even at max capacity he only has two magazines in reserve - it runs out really fast. When I'm playing Fragger I always make sure to either pick up ammo from a Skyhammer or sit on an ammo crate until I'm full up."

Dirtybomb,3dcymu,MK43,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:26:23 2015 UTC,"He is all around the best merc, there is no other merc that can turn a corner, and eliminate whatever is around it with 2% chance of it surviving (See: rhino). There is also no other merc that can eat headshots (still besides rhino) while 2 of his can generally end most of the female cast. Most fraggers don't really bank on the accuracy of the guns. Since the grenades have no counter as of now, he can instagib you anywhere, anytime he knows where you are. Fraggers are usually known for their lackluster gunplay, even though all of his guns minus the BR, put people on their asses instantly. All in all, he can deal more damage than 90% of other mercs, instantly wherever he wants, in an AOE. Has almost as much health as an Abrahms tank, and just about as much firepower in his primaries. You don't have to use him well to win, but a good fragger ends the game no matter what."

Dirtybomb,3dcymu,7supersonicfan,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:25:23 2015 UTC,"Generally speaking the M4 is considered better than the k-121.  The reason why fragger is one of the strongest mercs in the game, is his HP and his grenades. He has 150 HP, which is significantly more than any other merc besides rhino. His grenades are arguably the strongest ability in the game. You might not be good with them, but its easy to see why they're strong. They can completely take a player or multiple players out of a fight. When used properly they're difficult to see coming and dodge. Even if they don't kill a player outright, they can put players at low HP just before your team pushes, making it very easy to push a team off an objective.  Ultimately there is no better merc for straight up pushing players back, and being able to do that is critical in this game. Fragger can take map control better than any other merc and hes the clear-cut best merc for the purpose of killing players."

Dirtybomb,3dcymu,themilanguy1,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:26:02 2015 UTC,"When my team is losing, I always take Fragger to turn the tables on the opposite team. His grenades are the best to devaste enemies in their hidings. These grenades can be cooked and explode the moment they land on enemies' feet. They have better range and are much stronger than Nader's. They also insta-gib if I'm not mistaken."

Dirtybomb,3dcymu,DerpsterJ,1 point,Wed Jul 15 08:50:46 2015 UTC,Don't use the k121 if you don't like it then. M4 is quite powerful in Fragger's hands.

I would stick with m4 and learn to get headshots with it. Nade is your best weapon. Cook it and use number key to equip it to move better with it instead of just pressing q.

Dirtybomb,3dbmgy,Drakengard,3,Wed Jul 15 14:20:02 2015 UTC,It doesn't help that Bridge is a very confusing map to navigate at first.  It takes several matches before you know where things are and all the paths you can take.

Dirtybomb,3dbmgy,Wilcolt,7,Wed Jul 15 01:09:55 2015 UTC,Dunno. On bridge it's almost worth it. i'd held 5 min + stalls in that room by defusing C4

Dirtybomb,3dbmgy,Bowmayne,3,Wed Jul 15 04:54:03 2015 UTC,Yeah this is a little known fact about the generators and this works on every map but it wouldn't be as efficient as planting c4.
Dirtybomb,3dbmgy,canzpl,4,Wed Jul 15 01:10:29 2015 UTC,"Indeed. I think C4 is basically just a weapon that does an incredibly high amount of damage, which is why it's hard to escape if you're in the blast zone."

Dirtybomb,3de8mb,Wilcolt,2,Wed Jul 15 16:13:52 2015 UTC,"Well, Stoker, Redeye and possibly Thunder would be popular after the release of Phantom. They were all fully functioning before, too, although some adjustments were probably needed, especially with Thunder seeming to just be a slightly heavier version of Fragger with non-lethal grenades.  Alternatively, Pheonix and Turtle were both shown in the 'Scrubs' trailer, as was Phantom, so perhaps they'll be released. Pheonix was also functional, but Turtle to my knowledge has never really been shown, although his shield is in the files, so he appears developed to some degree.  It seems highly unlikely that Aimee was released any time soon, however, or the supposed 'Javelin' character."

Theory 1 is that since Phantom was in the E3 trailer, and the mercs from the E3 trailer are used a lot in promotional artwork, the next merc will be either Turtle or Phoenix.  Theory 2 is that since we have three of every class except Recon, the next merc will be Aimee or Redeye.  Personally I'm leaning towards theory 1, but I'm silently hoping they will surprise us and release Stoker."

Its not viable, and they won't do it. Theorycrafting in this matter is also largely pointless. SD will balance the merc or they won't. Talking about how they could make a new and improved phantom with new abilities is not going to get anywhere."
Dirtybomb,3dfa40,littlestminish,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:47:59 2015 UTC,"I get that it doesn't achieve anything much. I just enjoy this sort of thing, and I know lots of other people do. And it does have some potential to achieve things.   Out of curiosity, why do you say its bad? Specifically."
Dirtybomb,3dfa40,littlestminish,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:35:29 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying the idea is bad. If this game wasn't already ""done"" and it wouldn't take ridiculous manhours to make this new character that  you'd like to call phantom. You want Spy from TF2. That's what you want. And that sounds like in this game would be woefully underpowered. But that's besides the point, because the ""overhaul"" isn't going to happen. They are likely going to dump his cloak shield or he's going to have like 20 bonus HP, they are going to fix the bugged katana range, and he may become more or less visible, depending on how viable they think that makes him.  Either way, he's going to become less of a pubstomper and something of a balanced merk, and maybe he'll see a niche in comp, but I doubt it. He's a bad fit for this game, as the article from Plus Forward shows: https://www.reddit.com/r/Dirtybomb/comments/3ddeaj/phantom_strike_and_the_art_of_balance/?sort=new  So it really won't matter what they do. In comp he'll be useless, and they may make him less annoying and gimmicky and pubstompy in casual play. He's just a bad merc. I apologize for redundantly pointing out that this was a pointless venture as you already mentioned that in the OP, so it was unnecessary."
Dirtybomb,3dfa40,Alphadef,2,Thu Jul 16 00:10:17 2015 UTC,yeah fair enough  I wouldn't say its exactly spy but I guess it is in that direction for sure. I honestly think that's the best direction for splash damage to go with him since the current direction is just call of duty level solo play.

The thing is, I do not say that your suggestion is good nor bad, because that's beside the point, I'm saying that your suggestion is not balancing, it's a completely new merc. A completely new one. You want to push development to pre closed beta stage. Do you even think how many things is closely connected to Phantoms' features? How many other mercs would have to be reworked from the start? Do you even think about the complexity of this game  and how everything is connected? Phantom can be tweaked, very carefully, nothing more than that.

And most importantly, no amount of arguing or evidence would persuade him otherwise.

Dirtybomb,3de2a8,chrisorange,0,Wed Jul 15 20:50:20 2015 UTC,I believe rotation every month or so but I could be wrong. Looks like the devs are just trying out differrent things with the beta.

Dirtybomb,3dbao8,Ekk0mp,17,Thu Jul 16 03:03:46 2015 UTC,Imo if you trade up to a cobalt you should get to just choose which of the 9 loadouts you want. That should be your reward.
Dirtybomb,3dbao8,SC2_Bench,5,Wed Jul 15 04:12:03 2015 UTC,"Reward for the hard working people. And reward for the people who spend probably $35-100 to your game, to make these cobalt cards."
Dirtybomb,3dbao8,Shayru,6,Wed Jul 15 05:00:34 2015 UTC,They are currently looking into that matter. I said that back in the days before Cobalt and it will be a problem soon.
Dirtybomb,3dbao8,CORUSC4TE,3,Tue Jul 14 23:41:12 2015 UTC,i'd love to see at least one of these re-roll options put in (preferably both):   offer 2 cards of the same rarity with a small credit fee (not certain what'd be fair) = random loadout card of same rarity (you pick the merc it ends up being) offer up 1 card you wish to be re-rolled with 1 card of the tier below it (IE: 1 cobalt and 1 gold for a cobalt) and half the credits it costs to trade up to it = re-roll the higher rarity card into another card of the same rarity for the same merc
Dirtybomb,3dbao8,sic2k10,2,Wed Jul 15 07:03:23 2015 UTC,"The only reason I have an unwanted cobalt is due to the weapons I receive so I'd rather use another weapon, so yeah turning it into two random golds or something like that would make it much better, but I think a re roll on loadouts would be great."
Dirtybomb,3dbao8,AbyssOnDirtyBomb,2,Wed Jul 15 00:40:43 2015 UTC,"The problem with cobalt loadouts is the random part. One bad cobalt loadout is just as bad as one bad gold loadout; I'm not gonna play with it. So yeah, I do have maybe 4 or 5 cobalt cards I'm never gonna play with, and I traded all my loadouts up from lead to actual cobalt, all of this for nothing, all of these credits lost. RNG shouldn't be such a problem when you've spent so much time grinding cases and credits to finally get the ultimate cobalt, and end up disappointed."
Dirtybomb,3dbao8,ChasseurDePorcinet,4,Wed Jul 15 08:04:42 2015 UTC,Trade down ro re-roll cobalt for like 50k or something high like that.
Dirtybomb,3dbao8,ReReminiscence,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:47:18 2015 UTC,Another good option would be to either put two cobalts together to reroll or just pay x to reroll the skin.
Dirtybomb,3dbao8,scwala,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:19:57 2015 UTC,"Who would trade up 2 bad cobalt loadouts for 1 random cobalt when there is, at best, 2 or 3 decent loadouts for each merc, and most of the time one is clearly superior. That means from 11 to 33% to get a ""good"" loadout. Not worth it imo.  But I'd trade 3 cobalts to be able to choose the cobalt loadout I want."
Dirtybomb,3dbao8,ChasseurDePorcinet,1 point,Wed Jul 15 12:24:08 2015 UTC,Lets just pay 1$ and choose the cobalt we want.

If you dont completely out class your opponent the laning phase ends up being a fight for scraps that most of the time mean shit because of a team fight. Youre basically fighting for a chance to survive or kill an opponent by slivers of health. Team fights area all about positioning making most of the laning phase pointless.

Youre basically fighting for a chance to survive or kill an opponent by slivers of health. Team fights area all about positioning making most of the laning phase pointless.    Depth of game mechanics and variety equates fun.  DoTA laning is extremely important and if you think it's not you either never played the game or you have mental degeneration. It sets the pace for the rest of the game. Teamfights are not won based on better positioning, both prior decisions and minute to minute gameplay influence the outcome. HoTS has boring abilities, boring gamemodes and lack of a laning phase only compounds the shittiness of the game. Teamfighting 24/7 is not fun. Besides, the way HoTS is balanced the games snowball for one side like in LoL. Comebacks are not likely at all. In DoTA, comebacks are frequent, even in low-comeback patches.  The best HoTS offers is being a coffee-break MoBA.   Are you telling me TF2 isnt casual?   TF2 has non-interchangeable classes, a variety of loadouts and amazingly fun classic shooter combat, focusing on mobility, twitch aim and burst damage. It's an easy enough game to pick up, but it's insanely fun and deep. The fact that a game originally released in 2007 is still one of the most played games on Steam speaks  volumes on how good it is. The only thing it lacks currently is ranked matchmaking and with the recent CS:GO-ification changes this is bound to come in a future update.  Overwatch is just Dirty Bomb for 12 year olds. Or a coffee break DB if you will."

Dirtybomb,3dathb,prodiG,3,Wed Jul 15 02:47:11 2015 UTC,147 / 147 achievements with 19hrs played.  Nothing fishy about that at all.
Dirtybomb,3dathb,stinkyeel,2,Wed Jul 15 15:54:03 2015 UTC,To give him the benefit of the doubt he could have used SAM (Steam Achievement Manager) I highly doubt it though.
Dirtybomb,3dathb,footsie,5,Wed Jul 15 22:07:14 2015 UTC,"Wow, just ran into this guy. Please report him on Nexon, such obvious hacking and a pretty big asshole."
Dirtybomb,3dathb,Tanker0921,4,Thu Jul 16 00:14:20 2015 UTC,"Not to doubt or anything, but if you want to add to the report in a better manner, imho, you should go spectator and spectate the hacker and record that to submit it to Nexon. Seeing in first person the guy's crosshair instantly glued to target's head everytime is a more compelling proof."

Dirtybomb,3dathb,Tanker0921,5,Wed Jul 15 00:06:31 2015 UTC,I've got the same pre-canned response for my reports as well. This is more of an acknowledgement that they received the message than anything.   I can only hope that gets followed with a swift ban.

Dirtybomb,3dathb,Siggymiggy,-7,Wed Jul 15 05:57:11 2015 UTC,"No punkbuster, VAC is fine, cause i think its retarded how punkbuster works banning you from all the game platform"

Dirtybomb,3dathb,XohleT,-9,Wed Jul 15 05:48:33 2015 UTC,"lets put it this way,  I brought bf3, then i was punkbuster banned, should i also get banned on bf4?   The retard here is you"
Dirtybomb,3dathb,DayDreamerJon,7,Wed Jul 15 06:42:33 2015 UTC,Maybe you shouldn't cheat?
Dirtybomb,3dathb,XohleT,-10,Wed Jul 15 12:35:11 2015 UTC,"Maybe i learned my lesson and want to try out a new game on the same account?  Maybe i was quitting BF3 for BF4, and decided to dick around in BF3 as my farewell?  Maybe its fair to just ban them for the game they cheated on?  Maybe you guys are capitalist retards that loves money?"
Dirtybomb,3dathb,Ballsackologist,7,Wed Jul 15 13:48:47 2015 UTC,Maybe you are a full autismo who cheats in games?  I dont feel sorry for you getting banned in both games AT ALL.  Eat shit and die in a fire.
Dirtybomb,3dathb,ChinaRep,-10,Wed Jul 15 14:46:48 2015 UTC,"Something , Something , Fuck you..   Those wanting punkbusters. cant they see that punkbuster ban system is unfair. unlike VAC, which bans only on the games you cheated on.  Feel free to downvote, I insist. it will be my personal counter to who of you faggots wants punkbuster. When punkbuster gets implemented, imma un-install this shit"

Dirtybomb,3dg17w,axny,3,Thu Jul 16 00:00:26 2015 UTC,"What? No! If the progress would be stored client side that would happen. It would also make it really easy to mod your account for max. cash, level and all mercs with that.  Like most sensible online games, this game stores your account's data server-side."

Dirtybomb,3dg17w,axny,3,Thu Jul 16 01:42:03 2015 UTC,That wasn't funny though. You just answered a question incorrectly.
Dirtybomb,3db9mk,kAndyREW,10,Tue Jul 14 22:54:25 2015 UTC,"Hey guys, thanks for your feedback with my last one re: Thunder. I made some improvements since then 1) added more gameplay of the actual merc 2) Made the video a little shorter 3) Added a bit more ""production"" to it. Thanks for the help! :)"
Dirtybomb,3db9mk,Deathaster,2,Tue Jul 14 22:55:30 2015 UTC,"Question, did you make a video about Phoenix too? This is a really informative video, and I'd love to hear more about Phoenix!"
Dirtybomb,3db9mk,SgtTittyfist,6,Wed Jul 15 13:59:10 2015 UTC,"Kinda sad that the gameplay never really showed how dense the smoke was without the infrared vision active. From the few seconds I did see, it seems like the smoke really doesn't cover too much."
Dirtybomb,3db9mk,dejecaal,6,Wed Jul 15 12:08:18 2015 UTC,This actually looks like a really fun merc. Definitely looks like he's going to be my favourite out of the recon/covertops mercs.
Dirtybomb,3db9mk,Sushigut,4,Wed Jul 15 02:29:37 2015 UTC,"Also he's got that veteran look to him, like if Bill and Snake were mixed together, Red Eye would be that"
Dirtybomb,3db9mk,SgtTittyfist,2,Wed Jul 15 07:07:33 2015 UTC,Bill with Snake and the Terminator.
Dirtybomb,3db9mk,Snearky,4,Wed Jul 15 12:05:57 2015 UTC,It seems like he spots players just by looking at them down scope.
Dirtybomb,3db9mk,DirtyBoom,8,Wed Jul 15 00:22:00 2015 UTC,From what I remember it's the IR google secondary function.
Dirtybomb,3db9mk,Acekiller346,4,Wed Jul 15 02:37:28 2015 UTC,Correct
Dirtybomb,3db9mk,Dingus_Milo,3,Wed Jul 15 04:53:44 2015 UTC,Is it just me or did they score notifications look way better back then versus now?  Also the objective icons on the hud that told you the percentage it was at.
Dirtybomb,3db9mk,feench,6,Wed Jul 15 00:33:55 2015 UTC,"if you look at like the old trailer footage for Dirty Bomb, it's got all this nice dynamic lighting and vibrant colors... not sure why it's so washed out and simplified now. But i get the purpose, it makes things a bit more clear.  I DO like the old HUD though."
Dirtybomb,3db9mk,Terr_,2,Wed Jul 15 01:32:31 2015 UTC,Can he see cloaked phantoms while using his goggles?
Dirtybomb,3db9mk,thrnee,2,Wed Jul 15 05:30:15 2015 UTC,"IIRC yes, which is why I'm a little annoyed they didn't release him before Phantom."
Dirtybomb,3db9mk,LLAMATARIANISM,2,Wed Jul 15 17:19:19 2015 UTC,I want his gun sooo badddd
Dirtybomb,3db9mk,clustahz,1 point,Wed Jul 15 12:58:56 2015 UTC,Those are some godawful iron sights. Hopefully by the time they've added Red-Eye they'll have redone the loadout system and added attachments.
Dirtybomb,3db9mk,LLAMATARIANISM,5,Tue Jul 14 23:02:32 2015 UTC,"they're good sights from what I can tell. garand\m14 style sights are always my preference. attachments would be excellent, though."
Dirtybomb,3db9mk,Wilcolt,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:22:57 2015 UTC,"do you think they will add attachments?? holy crap that would be amazing.  honestly i think if Red Eye had better sights, it would make that BR too strong. Could you imagine a x1 or x2 scope on there? good god."
Dirtybomb,3db9mk,Hutchythesmall,3,Tue Jul 14 23:05:56 2015 UTC,"I'm almost certain. Whenever you equip a weapon in offline mode it has iron sights, even sniper rifles and the Stark. And there's a folder inside the CookedPC folder (along with the files for weapons and mercs) called WeaponAttachments or WeaponMods or something like that. The Selbstadt even comes silenced.  Personally, I want a sniper scope on my K-121."
Dirtybomb,3db9mk,Wilcolt,2,Tue Jul 14 23:11:00 2015 UTC,"The Selbstadt even comes silenced.   The icon for it on loadout cards always had it silenced, so this explains that."
Dirtybomb,3db9mk,LLAMATARIANISM,3,Wed Jul 15 04:45:41 2015 UTC,"It was silenced in earlier versions, they just forgot to change the icon"
Dirtybomb,3db9mk,Winsane,1 point,Wed Jul 15 10:05:17 2015 UTC,"Ah, alright then."
Dirtybomb,3db9mk,dejecaal,1 point,Wed Jul 15 11:23:25 2015 UTC,"oh wow that would be fascinating... good find!  Come to think of it, if you've seen that thread regarding the original concept art of the weapons, a lot of them seem to come with attachments and things like that. https://www.artstation.com/artwork/dirty-bomb-shotguns-misc  haha sniper scope on the k121, dirty dirty dirty."
Dirtybomb,3db9mk,Winsane,5,Tue Jul 14 23:13:39 2015 UTC,"The loadout system is gimmicky and full of RNG. There's no shame in doing something generic if that generic thing is far more solid. Planetside, for example, takes a lot of its core gameplay elements from Battlefield and those 2 games don't feel remotely similar. Changing one shitty, non-gameplay-affecting aspect of this game is not ""making this game Battlefield 4."""
Dirtybomb,3db9mk,DirtyBoom,2,Tue Jul 14 23:28:00 2015 UTC,"eh honestly i can appreciate both sides. I DO like the customization of the attachments system, but more often than not i usually revert to a x1 or x2 scope on my automatic weapons... having a loadout card system ""forces"" me to experiment with different types of gameplay, and is an interesting concept."
Dirtybomb,3db9mk,Winsane,-11,Tue Jul 14 23:48:35 2015 UTC,So the next class to be released will be able to put up a wall anywhere that only he can see through?  So he will essentially have wallhack?  I'm glad I have already lost almost all of my interest for this game.
Dirtybomb,3db9mk,Hutchythesmall,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:57:31 2015 UTC,"You can shoot through the ""wall"" as well as sometimes see things beyond it. With hitsounds just spraying into the smoke sounds like it would be a reasonably effective strategy.  Much like smoke grenades in ET except it seems to be a lot more useful, which is good."
Dirtybomb,3db9mk,josh_rose,-4,Wed Jul 15 02:14:26 2015 UTC,Sounds completely broken to me and I don't see any way of balancing it without making the whole ability useless.
Dirtybomb,3db9mk,TwoThreeSkidoo,3,Wed Jul 15 02:15:47 2015 UTC,"Dude.. It's literraly smoke. You can shoot through it, RedEye will be seen too, his eye will glow red and will be a ""shoot me"" sign.  I really don't understand your concern."
Dirtybomb,3db9mk,Winsane,2,Wed Jul 15 02:24:06 2015 UTC,"his eye will glow red and will be a ""shoot me"" sign.   That changes everything. Sorry if he said it in the video, I didn't watch all of it."
Dirtybomb,3db9mk,TwoThreeSkidoo,2,Wed Jul 15 02:27:18 2015 UTC,"I didn't. Some people said it was taken out, others are unsure if it'll be in the final release. I did put it in the description just for good measure though."
Dirtybomb,3db9mk,Winsane,2,Wed Jul 15 03:02:24 2015 UTC,"He didn't, but you can see his red light pretty clearly from the other side of the smoke."
Dirtybomb,3db9mk,TwoThreeSkidoo,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:13:19 2015 UTC,"More broken than a revive gun, or artillery strike? Most mercs have ""broken"" skills. I don't see this smoke grenade being any more useful than a turret, for example."

Dirtybomb,3dbver,Argarck,1 point,Wed Jul 15 11:23:28 2015 UTC,So I assume it has been tested as a feature during development and is left in the code. You managed to bug the game to use the 3rd person camera setup.
Dirtybomb,3dg812,blamethemouse,7,Thu Jul 16 00:53:01 2015 UTC,He'd still be OP because you can't fix people not paying attention.

Dirtybomb,3dg812,shadowpikachu,3,Thu Jul 16 01:03:43 2015 UTC,After a while your brain will make the connection automatically and you will see through his cloak EVERY time.
Dirtybomb,3dg812,Schoolgirls_,2,Thu Jul 16 04:35:04 2015 UTC,But I can see him though. Or no you're right you're me and know what I can and can't see or that I'm used to dealing with invis backstabbers after all the TF2 time.
Dirtybomb,3dg812,Alphadef,4,Thu Jul 16 04:42:28 2015 UTC,I see him all the time... And I shoot him
Dirtybomb,3dg812,TheQakZz,-7,Thu Jul 16 01:56:03 2015 UTC,"Cool, we do too....When he's point blank, you can't do anything about him. So don't even try to defend it. Ignorant cockwad."
Dirtybomb,3dg812,Alphadef,2,Thu Jul 16 01:59:05 2015 UTC,Hypocrisy at its finest. I see him at a reasonable distance and kill him easily unless I have a burst of horrible aim. You know why? I'm not blind.
Dirtybomb,3dg812,TheQakZz,-7,Thu Jul 16 02:00:38 2015 UTC,"I'm not blind either.....I can see him just fine. The melee damage is insane and by the time you shoot him in the head 8 fucking times, he's hit you and you're dead. Don't try to sound smart you ignorant cock."
Dirtybomb,3dg812,Alphadef,5,Thu Jul 16 02:02:45 2015 UTC,"If I can successfully kill a man with 10 fps and mediocre aim, where is your excuse?"
Dirtybomb,3dg812,TheQakZz,-3,Thu Jul 16 02:10:49 2015 UTC,"The character is op and you're lying your ass off. I can kill him for the most part, but don't try to act like you can reck a phantom in close range kid. At range, no problem...but in close range, you're fucked. Idk if you've played against the worst player in the fucking world...but your statements are full of bullshit."
Dirtybomb,3dg812,Alphadef,4,Thu Jul 16 02:14:13 2015 UTC,I speak from experiance. I'm sorry I just have an easier time dealing with melee than you do. However you seem uninterested in intelligent debate so have fun with that.
Dirtybomb,3dg812,TheQakZz,-4,Thu Jul 16 02:16:33 2015 UTC,I'm interested in an intelligent debate with somebody who actually has some incite on what the fuck they're talking about. Not some random who gets a lucky few kills on a bad player and thinks that he's good at a game.
Dirtybomb,3dg812,Lim3s,2,Thu Jul 16 02:24:35 2015 UTC,I can get behind this

Dirtybomb,3descu,Nikem45,13,Wed Jul 15 18:31:06 2015 UTC,"The problem is people have been telling the developers for over a month now about some of the issues that're still persisting.   On one hand development takes time, on the other hand people expect more changes within a month of an open beta.   Regardless of how many changes have or haven't been made - it feels like nothing has changed since the first time I opened the game, for the most part.   The sparks update is the only notable update outside of Phantom/Aim Punch. If anything else has changed, even as somebody who makes content and is active on this subreddit, you could've fooled me.   Though I would caution people to stop hiding behind the thought that ""this isn't a 100% game"" - exedore said himself this game is in shipping mode more or less after they balanced phantom. It has most of the core components as it is - it's mostly polish and fine tuning at this point.   People come to the sub-reddit and forums to ""flame"" and ""bitch"" because they love this game and want to see it improved. Not to mention a lot of the ""phantom qq"" threads often have some substance posts within by people looking to combat the issue.   Another thread TELLING people what they should or shouldn't do isn't helping, honestly. The sub-reddit will filter out what it does/doesn't want and for the most part does a pretty decent job of doing that. Some people don't have solutions but it doesn't mean they shouldn't be frustrated - and often they make the posts to have people help them understand why X or Y is happening or when Y or Z might help the issue."
Dirtybomb,3descu,denotsmi,2,Wed Jul 15 19:05:56 2015 UTC,"Well, the stilleto got nerfed. There's that. Haha. ha. ha.."
Dirtybomb,3descu,Tiesieman,-4,Wed Jul 15 19:14:58 2015 UTC,"I'm not ""hiding"" behind the fact that it's in beta, I'm simply saying that it is STILL in beta and STILL needs some balancing, but it wont make it better by posting ""I QUIT BCZ PHANTOM!"".   Also, I never said that one is not allowed to post something they're mad about (I never said anyone is not allowed to do anything), but I'm saying that if you're mad about something it is a lot better actually providing data about the issue rather than saying ""I'm angry."""
Dirtybomb,3descu,denotsmi,5,Wed Jul 15 19:11:04 2015 UTC,"I would urge you to use the search function and even just type the word ""phantom"".   Every post I can see on the first page of results is, to some extent, explaining why they like/dislike phantom and why they think he's too strong.   I'd expect a thread like this on the forums, but the reddit has actually kept pretty civil about the whole ordeal.   I'd understand this post if it were the case, but it's not."
Dirtybomb,3descu,denotsmi,-7,Wed Jul 15 19:15:28 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying that it's just about Phantom. That's the thing. About everything in general. The Phantom posts are surprisingly good posts the majority of them. I'm just commenting on the atmosphere in general, not about Phantom."
Dirtybomb,3descu,denotsmi,5,Wed Jul 15 19:17:06 2015 UTC,"The atmosphere in general is people who have spent dozens to hundreds of hours and those who have spent real cash having a problem with the speed at which the game is making corrective changes. Or the lack of changes in their entirety.   Just because you don't like the atmosphere doesn't mean it's incorrect for being there, people are pissed and the sub-reddit reflects that. They love the game, as they almost universally state, but there's a few things stopping from them loving it even more."
Dirtybomb,3descu,wrightosaur,-3,Wed Jul 15 19:22:46 2015 UTC,"The one that has spent houndreds of hours wont come here and go ""I'm quitting, phantom needs nerf"".

Dirtybomb,3descu,wrightosaur,-5,Wed Jul 15 19:26:07 2015 UTC,"Just as I said in the other comment (Makes me really confused) that it seems that the communication here is faulty. I do hear what you're saying, and I do understand what you're trying to say. All I can say is that my opinion differ. There's no reason to go balls to the walls and have a fistfight over it. What you're saying is completely valid and I can to some degree agree with you."
Dirtybomb,3descu,zangerinus,2,Wed Jul 15 19:28:54 2015 UTC,"So that paragraph of text could've been shortened to just say ""I don't agree with you."".   But you know, you have to pretend you have the biggest dictionary in town, don't you?"

If you see the upvoted threads all of them have critical insights into what is wrong with Phantom and what could be done to fix it.  There's a difference between criticism and flaming that you just don't get.

Dirtybomb,3dcizx,INI_Fourzero,10,Wed Jul 15 05:08:31 2015 UTC,Phantom is evidence that they can not balance mercs that are not in the roster. Splash Damage said it themselves: they get more data in 30 minutes of release that they do in all of their internal testing. I mostly think they were withdrawn because of the business model.
Dirtybomb,3dcizx,MrBogard,8,Wed Jul 15 06:50:22 2015 UTC,Yeah except no amount of testing is required to know that Phantom's kit on paper is bullshit.
Dirtybomb,3dcizx,denotsmi,0,Wed Jul 15 08:03:43 2015 UTC,Stealth + Speed + more durability than just as speedy with no stealth mercs + absolutely amazing primary weapon + 1 shotting most mercs and 2 shotting the last two or three + invincibility until cloak runs out = WHAT THE FUCK WERE THEY THINKING?
Dirtybomb,3dcizx,broadcasthenet,6,Wed Jul 15 09:49:31 2015 UTC,"If you actually pay attention, you can see the shimmer of Phantom's invisibility, it's almost blinding how obvious it is.  Paying attention and using shotguns means 1 dead Phantom."
Dirtybomb,3dcizx,Keino_,3,Wed Jul 15 10:38:41 2015 UTC,Yeah I've been WRECKED by Aura and Proxy IN cloak..after I find out they're player is good I tend to be more cautious. Though im not always running corners with my sword out unless im inside a building with small rooms.
Dirtybomb,3dcizx,TheKrowefawkes,-4,Wed Jul 15 11:36:01 2015 UTC,Have you played as Aura or any of the low health classes that all use shotguns? The shotgun is 2 shots with perfect headshots meaning all pellets hit the head(which requires literally pointblank) when they are in stealth. While the phantom kills you in one hit.   Shotguns are extremely week in this game require pretty much the same distance as melee to be effective and even then are less effective than the katana.   Phantom is broken in every possible way. Also his shimmer is less noticeable than the spy in TF2 and the spy in TF2 is infinitely weaker than this phantom.
Dirtybomb,3dcizx,broadcasthenet,9,Wed Jul 15 11:01:09 2015 UTC,Also his shimmer is less noticeable than the spy in TF2   The Spy has no shimmer unless somebody bumps into him. He is absolutely 100% invisible.
Dirtybomb,3dcizx,SgtTittyfist,5,Wed Jul 15 11:45:24 2015 UTC,"I've played tf2 for over 250 hours, I've never spotted a cloaked spy.  In only 13 hours of Dirty Bomb, I can easily spot a cloaked phantom.  Next, shotguns have a huge range in comparison to most games and in contrast, the katana has a tiny one.  Also, I play mostly as Aura and Proxy, using shotguns. I do pretty well."
Dirtybomb,3dcizx,Keino_,-12,Wed Jul 15 11:24:23 2015 UTC,I am starting to believe you are one of those people running phantom right now.   Shotgun has about a 20 meter range at best and at that range would take all 6 shots to get a kill if they even die. It's about a 5 - 7 meter range for insta kills to the head(which doesn't work on Phantom or Rhino).   If you actually play the classes with shotguns like Aura you will find yourself using your pistol very often cause the shotguns do like 12 damage at more than 20 meters.   As for Phantom he has invis and can do 2 heavy attacks in the time it takes you to fire 2 of your pump action shotgun blasts(which is the minimum required at pointblank with perfect headshots).   It's not balanced at all and the only way you would ever win that encounter assuming it was 1v1 and you saw him coming(cause you will die 100% of the time if you don't see him coming) is if he runs in a straight line and starts out about 20 meters away.   I am finding myself playing solely mercs with 120 hp or more right now because of how fucking broken Phantom is. He is the second most tanky merc + stealth + insta kill 40% of all content + amazing primary gun + extremely short cooldown on stealth + invincibility.   It's fucking insane in fact I have only played 4 hours in the last 3 days because of how fucking bad it is.
Dirtybomb,3dcizx,broadcasthenet,5,Wed Jul 15 11:34:50 2015 UTC,"I have never played Phantom, and the first 10 hours of DB, I nearly exclusively played Aura, as most people weren't going medic."

He can't catch up to any of the classes he can one-shot provided they make even the slightest attempt to stay out of his range, and shotguns have a far longer effective range than his katana."

Phantom was taken out of the alpha because he was either hardly op or hardly up. They had issues back then and thought they fixed it in the time which they did on a competitive level but for the public matches he is to strong due to the lack of awareness and rulesets like 1 merc rule.

Dirtybomb,3d9kzx,TheMightyBarbarian,6,Tue Jul 14 20:19:41 2015 UTC,"I strongly disagree with the statement   It's in beta   Because the game isn't. It's in beta simply to shift any blame of their horrendously inefficient anti-cheat system. This game accepts microtransactions ranging from $1.00 to $30.00 bundles.   The developers and publishers have decided their game is complete enough to be available for download to the market by anyone, that they should be receiving revenue from microtransactions and that the game is stable enough to support a competitive scene. The fact that they choose to still claim being in Beta is nothing more than a shady marketing scheme to avoid any problems. As a Beta product has vastly less restrictions on what it can and cannot do, over a full release one of which, the biggest I might add is the benefit of a complete overhaul with no legal responsibility to refund customers. While a full launch title has different standards it must adhere to.  To put it into common language. This game is a grocery store, they allow anyone into the store, you gather your groceries and proceed to check out, when you do the cashier reminds you, ""We don't open to the public for a few months"". You know that's bullshit.  The issue is an Open Beta game for all intents and purposes is a Full Release title. And the idea that them removing the message at the bottom of the main menu saying they are beta, will in anyway make up for the incredibly lackluster gameplay and the catastrophic failure of them to even just curb the rampant hacker/botter issue in the ""ranked"" scene is laughable.  This game is already treading on thin ice and the longer they wait to implement a reliable anti-cheat system the closer they are to shutting down the game, because E-Sports are big now, if they want to have any chance of entering that market the only way they can do that is to stop the cheating and to actively find a way to eliminate those unfair game play practices, e.g. Spawn Killing."

If you take a look at CS:GO you'll notice the pretty painful hacking issue occurring. Still funny that VAC isn't programmed to put tougher ban parameters on people that are global within 2 days of acquiring the game. But really, as a free game, most devs won't pay or work to integrate any stronger cheat detection, the reason we have Xigncode now is because it's the free alternative.

Dirtybomb,3de75t,HKProxyOne,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:06:33 2015 UTC,"just spikes, and it felt smoother when locked at ~200... i felt like i was playing better.

Dirtybomb,3de75t,HKProxyOne,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:08:10 2015 UTC,"Well the FPS stutters are probably engine related bugs, because almost everyone seems to have them. That said, higher FPS really only matters if your monitor can support it. If it's a regular monitor it will definitely be capped at 60hz, meaning anything over 60fps won't be displayed.   In all honesty you don't need to upgrade, as you'll gain nothing in this scenario from just more FPS."
Dirtybomb,3de75t,promyy,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:14:25 2015 UTC,sounds good thanks.
Dirtybomb,3de75t,HKProxyOne,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:19:41 2015 UTC,"It's been explained thousands of times - even having a 60Hz monitor, players benefit from FPS higher than 60 due to reduced stuttering, decreased input lag and more stable framerate. Try to go into any GoldSrc game and cap your FPS at 60, then at 121 and you'll understand the difference."
Dirtybomb,3de75t,Terr_,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:24:24 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying any FPS above 60 is unnecessary, however going from 140 to 240 should be irrelevant (unless he has a 144hz monitor, then it would be a different case of course)."

Dirtybomb,3d8s0h,enilyxx,10,Tue Jul 14 11:46:47 2015 UTC,"Well... that player could've done that with Vassili as well, no? Just without having to charge up first. Great aim is great aim no matter what gun you're using, and although Revivr makes a decent sorta-sniper-rifle, actual sniper rifles are still better."
Dirtybomb,3d8s0h,WyMANderly,4,Tue Jul 14 14:49:03 2015 UTC,"Ya but rail gun though, also revives."
Dirtybomb,3d8s0h,vampwood,9,Tue Jul 14 15:53:07 2015 UTC,"Yeah, well like any other FPS, there are no shortage of Vassili's around. Usually camping back, being useless. Nothing like seeing two or three of them not playing the objective, quite frustrating."
Dirtybomb,3d8s0h,undead77,3,Tue Jul 14 20:34:54 2015 UTC,Indeed. That's exactly why I'd instantly refund Vassili if I could. With Sparks I can actually help out the team with the addition of having the Revivr as a long-range gun.
Dirtybomb,3d8s0h,undead77,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:43:08 2015 UTC,"I agree. Two, sometimes three medics can work wonders."
Dirtybomb,3d8s0h,chrisorange,5,Tue Jul 14 21:14:04 2015 UTC,Yes...this is one reason I play her a lot. It really really feels like a quake rail gun. Don't even confirm hits imo just charge revive gun shoot and instant switch to SMG to finish almost anyone off. If you get caught out you go behind a corner and drop mini med kits to peek again and take a proper duel. Usually winning due to how tanky you can be. This thing also melts heads of people on turrets.  The faster res gun charge actually seems like a downgrade because you don't just charge faster you also over heat faster which has been a significant problem every time I'VE tried it your mileage may vary. I've done just fine with only the perk to give more health to revived targets.  The other reason is the suicide run to get into line of sight of someone to res that wins you the game. This is a really cool class imo and if you are constantly reviving it forces the enemy team to respect that fact and spend time actually finishing people off.
Dirtybomb,3d8s0h,Gulrotsaft,11,Tue Jul 14 14:48:45 2015 UTC,Vasili can detect Phantoms with the sensor which is very important at the moment so don't be.  Also a clutch play like that can also be performed by a good vasili.

Judging by the clear statistical disparity between the weapons, I don't think they're going for the ""every weapon is a sidegrade"" approach. Classes who exclusively use SMGs get access to the Crotzni and/or the KEK-10 - the two best SMGs. But the shotty classes like Proxy, Fletcher or Aura get the Hochfir, with low DPS (although it's still a good gun), and the awful Blishlok. I think it's a design choice that the KEK-10 and Crotzni are so good. Although the KEK is a bit too good."

It has happen on more than one occasion where i get the damn phantom semi low on hp and the he cloaks and gain effectively upwards of 75 more that has to be removed before he can die ... (Thats close to Rhino level hp)  So yeah i am effectively in the state where no phantoms means it is playable.   How i see it no damage immunity ever on him.  Uncloak as soon as he take damage.  Lower the damage from the katana especially.   Preferably a huge strobe above there head when they are stealthed.  No ranged weapons.   What i consider a win is the removal of the class or they look at the spy in TF2 in regards to where the power level should be.

I'm very new to the game, but it feels like there are a lot of things that make it feel kinda crappy, compared to grenades, airstrikes, etc.   The long activation delay makes them hard to use up close - makes sense, you're supposed to set a trap.  They flash bright colours, super easy to shoot and destroy - ok, that's what corners and boxes are for.  The trigger delay feels pretty bad. If I get killed in a firefight and watch someone set off my mine and dodge it by accident because it takes so long to detonate when triggered, it feels pretty stupid.   And if I toss one down, draw someone in while shooting to actually pull off trapping them, I have to worry about friendly fire from my own device.   Of course all the other explosives hurt their users as well if you're out of position and hit yourself, but together with everything else it makes it feel really unsatisfying as a cooldown, compared with other mercs equivalents."

This was my first week of DB, so I started with Aura for my medic, but was frustrated with micromanaging the Healing Station on Attacking maps, although it is very strong on defense, but I found that Sparks's hit-it-and-quit-it approach to healing was very liberating.  The Revive-gun means that I can stay in cover to resurrect allies, and once I realized its damage potential, I bought her immediately.  Nader's a lot of fun, but I found myself annoyed by the lack of real support that I could bring to a team.  I found myself wishing I had brought Fragger most times that I played her, mostly because I could cook the grenades for better effect.  Marty was great to deal with all the Phantoms I fought, as a way to keep them on their toes.  Proxxy, ugh.  I suppose it's just my playstyle, but her mines rarely helped me, and her low HP meant that I would be vulnerable any time I tried to get the objecetive."

You also want to put the mines somewhere with a lot of noise and enemy traffic to catch them. But really, you can't think of the mine as her only ability. She's among the fastest mercs in the game too, AND she's an Engineer. No Engineer will get stuff done if they're getting shot at, anyways, but you want to find windows to run in, do your work, plant C4 or whatever, and run off somewhere else or wait and ambush someone trying to disarm.

Dirtybomb,3d9ro0,nahtani,4,Tue Jul 14 17:17:20 2015 UTC,Which bug is that?
Dirtybomb,3d9ro0,WyMANderly,6,Tue Jul 14 19:22:27 2015 UTC,A low charge can be spammed to quickly nuke an EV.
Dirtybomb,3d9ro0,Catechin,7,Tue Jul 14 19:37:05 2015 UTC,"What's the intended functionality? Is Revivr not supposed to do significant damage to the EV at all, or is the low charge damage just higher than it should be?"
Dirtybomb,3d9ro0,WyMANderly,6,Tue Jul 14 19:38:54 2015 UTC,At the very least the latter.
Dirtybomb,3d9ro0,Catechin,3,Tue Jul 14 19:39:58 2015 UTC,Is that a bug? I thought it was an exploitable feature.

Dirtybomb,3d9ro0,LordHole,4,Tue Jul 14 19:45:19 2015 UTC,"Sparks is super fun. I love being able to revive from a distance while having decent long-range capability as well. One of my favorite things to do is stand in LoS of allies but out of LoS of enemies and try to anticipate people going down. There's nothing more satisfying to me than popping someone back up with 100% HP right as they die. It irritates the enemy team to no end, too (though I'm not certain many of them realize how much time you have to devote to anticipating and charging in order to do that that could've been spent fighting). She's most certainly going to be my first merc purchase. Proxy is fun, though I want to try out Bushwhacker before I decide which engineer to purchase. I think he'd be a bit more my style. Nader was my favorite merc before I learned to play Sparks, and she'll probably always be one of my favorite area denial mercs. Just a solid all-around fighter. Martyrdom is fun as well, though it's really more of a pub-stomping tool since people who know what they're doing rarely fall for it."
Dirtybomb,3d9ro0,WyMANderly,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:23:20 2015 UTC,I like your flair. It's funny when I hear Sparks say that. She might be a tad stoic.
Dirtybomb,3d9ro0,AMasonJar,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:18:03 2015 UTC,She's probably my favorite merc so far in terms of personality. Very odd.
Dirtybomb,3d9ro0,WyMANderly,4,Wed Jul 15 00:54:57 2015 UTC,I love my proxy. I love racing in the start of the match to almost instantly plant c4 or repair vehicle. After playing the first few days with the 3 I bought the starter pack for proxy and bought Nader with the 50k credits included. I LOVE using my Nader to clear out campers and minefields. My squad typically includes Nader and proxy with the 3rd rotating depending on missions. If no missions I run it phantom in case our team gets spawn camped so I can sneak thru and get us back on objective. Sparks didn't impress me too much. Not for 50k. I see a lot of sparks getting killed constantly while trying to charge up.
Dirtybomb,3d9ro0,sheriffnick,4,Tue Jul 14 16:54:39 2015 UTC,"I really want to love Sparks, but I just do not do well with her main gun. Something about managing the charge throws my aim off."
Dirtybomb,3d9ro0,TroubleEntendre,3,Tue Jul 14 20:33:34 2015 UTC,"I gave Sparks and Nader a go, and I liked them both, but I got hooked on Nader more. I felt I could do more for my team playing Nader. The area denial is so dead useful especially when there's a Medic + Rhino combo hunkered down. I'd certainly like to give Proxy a chance, though as well. All in all, they all offer fun and different ways to play."
Dirtybomb,3d9ro0,playersbro,5,Tue Jul 14 23:39:22 2015 UTC,"I have to say I love all three. Probably Proxy>Sparks>Nader here.   I've used proxy to save games a few times, between her fast speed and objective specialization, I can just proxy stack with a friend or two and we'll eventually get C4 defused or EV fixed.  Sparks is a medic way more my style, compared to aura. I love the long range ability she has, and the revive gun does decent damage on it's own so I don't worry about getting caught with it out. (Let's not forget her EV damage is pretty broken right now though)  I haven't played Nader enough to say anything really. Understanding angles in maps, and using her grenades as a way to inflict damage without line of sight is a damn sustainable way to play her. Stay out of sight, and make them go boom."
Dirtybomb,3d9ro0,Jawnnn,2,Tue Jul 14 17:01:19 2015 UTC,"Proxy is amazing! Basically TF2 scout + mines. Nader is great for nests clearing, crowd control, not to mention insta gib against ≤90 hp classes. Bought both of them. Sparks is great necromancer + a Huntsman. All of them are a must buy."
Dirtybomb,3d9ro0,slider2k,2,Tue Jul 14 17:45:23 2015 UTC,"I enjoyed Proxy + sparks, i only really used nader for the messions that involved here. Can't wait for the new rotation though."
Dirtybomb,3d9ro0,7supersonicfan,2,Tue Jul 14 17:58:44 2015 UTC,"Sparks benefits way to much from the current gibbing situation.  Nader, is annoying, I'll say that much."

Dirtybomb,3d9ro0,dutchwonder,2,Tue Jul 14 22:53:46 2015 UTC,I like Nader a lot and will probably pick her up next. Getting used to her grenades and trying my best not to prematurely detonate when I don't need to...  (I play a lot of Sparks so I know how frustrating this can be!)

Sparks is probably the best medic merc out there right now if played correctly,and nader... nader is just nader. A nice merc,but ofcourse she gets annoying if everybody starts playing her. Im happy that the nadespam is finally over."
Dirtybomb,3d9ro0,Jessy0701x,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:42:14 2015 UTC,"Sparks is far away from best medic. In fact she is worst.  Her health pack are weaker than Sawbones and on longer recharge. Her weapon and speed is same as Aura but she dont have heal station.  Only thing that make her stand out is res gun. Which is very situational. Putting her mid ground between defence-Aura, or attack-sawbones"
Dirtybomb,3d9ro0,Lobotomist,2,Wed Jul 15 07:23:10 2015 UTC,"Proxy - Seems well rounded. Great speed, and the proximity mines' warning sound is distinct enough to let attentive players counter them by paying attention while still providing area denial in the need to locate their low profiles. Nader - Came to hate her a bit while playing as Aura, since a Grenade Launcher direct hit OHKs me, but I'm also a speedy target going up against a projectile weapon, so I think it evens out. As a new player, Martyrdom annoys me to no end, but that's really just a matter of learning to not going for the knife finish against Nader. I think I like Fragger more thanks to the M4 and durability. Sparks - Played with/against the least of the three, but seems very strong in the hands of a skilled player. Revive Gun can be used offensively as a railgun-esque weapon, right? I hope they fix her damage against EVs, since that bug is awful to play against."
Dirtybomb,3d9ro0,phalmatticus,2,Tue Jul 14 21:47:53 2015 UTC,"Railgun medic, no regrets spending the credits on her."
Dirtybomb,3d9ro0,El_Ejcovero,2,Tue Jul 14 22:34:51 2015 UTC,"Proxy is probably my favorite tech. Even if the mines don't kill the raw information they provide is so strong with the right team. And double jumping in buildings allow you to win gun fights you shouldn't.  Nader is not as fun as I first thought she'd be. She's great on maps where the other team has the mounted mg but without being able to cook the nades smart players can work around them. Sparks is great. In the right hands, and those hands are not mine. She can be so powerful in the right hands but the only medic I enjoy is sawbones cause the other medics make me feel like I'm relying on my team and I can't do anything myself. The snipes and ranged revives make up for the weaponry we all want phantom to have, but it's not my playstyle.  Next week I heard was arty, fragger, and fletcher. Sucks for me the only new merc available for me is fletcher. Happy fragging boys!"
Dirtybomb,3d9ro0,ChrisGoesMad,2,Wed Jul 15 02:21:11 2015 UTC,"I really like Sparks, she's on the to-buy list, though a ways down behind fletcher and bushwhacker.   Nader needs something done to her grenade launcher. Its fine when theres just one, but horrible when there is more than one. I think she gets too many grenades when compared with Fragger. I really don't like playing her, and I doubt I'll ever use her again.  Proxy is cool. Really like her. I just can't use shotguns."
Dirtybomb,3d9ro0,Ayrr,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:34:44 2015 UTC,"I definitely prefer the SMG loadout for Proxy it is good for both short and long distances, which I feel help my team much more.

Dirtybomb,3d9ro0,xwcg,2,Wed Jul 15 08:12:23 2015 UTC,"Sparks' mine is good for countering phantoms. I love to throw one down when a phantom is chasing me and then shoot it, causing massive damage."

Dirtybomb,3d9ro0,chillforce,2,Wed Jul 15 03:58:04 2015 UTC,"I loved proxy and sparks quite a lot. I unintentionally ran a waifu brigade setup with all three of the free mercs a few times before I unlocked fragger and good cards for skyhammer and aura. Nader was kinda meh for me, mainly because I didn't like her primary. Proxy made me feel like a fast little objective taking badass, and Sparks was the same way except in a more medic-flavored sort of way.

Nader is 1/2 demo from Tf2 (no sticky bombs) , very effective and annoying. Surely important character and nobody will miss its spam when the free rotation goes.  Sparks is bit of one trick pony. Only good for rez. Her med packs are on longer recharge and less potent than Sawbones ones. I think both Aura and Sawbones are better."

Nader idiots going 6 naders while defending maps with no ev. No medics (or just me) No ammo classes.  Easily telling when Nader idiots respawned because they unload all 6 grenades at once.  Nader idiots killing themselves even when you're running towards them with the defib charging and with no enemy in sight.  I fucking hate Nader players. Sorry.

Dirtybomb,3dc6le,TinFoilGreg,2,Wed Jul 15 06:17:13 2015 UTC,Personally I can see interest in the DB comp scene getting even bigger once Execution is a permanently available mode.
Dirtybomb,3dc6le,DarkangelUK,1 point,Wed Jul 15 11:28:54 2015 UTC,The whole point of this league is to gauge interest in this type of thing!   It's so cool to see so much interest. I know certain games that have $100k tournaments with less participation. This bodes well for future competitions :D
Dirtybomb,3de8lo,Xanza,13,Wed Jul 15 16:13:17 2015 UTC,I heard Nexon also supports ISIS because they publish games about bombing things.
Dirtybomb,3de8lo,Ballsackologist,3,Wed Jul 15 16:22:03 2015 UTC,If you could kick people on the other team then you could just constantly kick the enemy teams best players. Every game I know (on steam) supports special character names.
Dirtybomb,3de8lo,Precipere,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:16:20 2015 UTC,"That vote kick schtick is bullshit, not once have I ever come across that in any game let alone it being successful.  Worst I've seen is abuse of kick votes in quake 3, e.g. First person to load in can vote whatever he wants & it'll pass(like kick all/map change etc) which can be amusing but also rarely happened.  It's a f2p game, you need the freedom of calling votes to kick players on the other team, also even when there is a hacker and they're being vote kicked most people can't seem to figure out how to even vote. Woo."
Dirtybomb,3de8lo,zlinky,-1,Wed Jul 15 17:03:16 2015 UTC,It's not about a single player kicking another player. It's about a consensus kick. All players in the game need to vote. Adding &nbsp; special characters is totally different from blank spacing in the name. It makes __username__ (_ = space) and &nbsp;&nbsp;username&nbsp;&nbsp; totally and completely different names and easier for someone to fly under the radar.
Dirtybomb,3de8lo,Manaburn7,2,Wed Jul 15 16:57:04 2015 UTC,"Bigger complaint is votes don't actually work right now. Does not matter if your entire team votes to kick a guy or scramble, won't work."
Dirtybomb,3de8lo,Hutchythesmall,5,Wed Jul 15 18:52:36 2015 UTC,Do any games let you vote kick enemy players? You could just vote kick their best players. If they add an option to view someone's steam profile through the scoreboard then that won't be an issue
Dirtybomb,3de8lo,Arg0ms,2,Wed Jul 15 16:20:20 2015 UTC,You cannot vote to kick someone that is not on your team.     what the fuck kinda complaint is this
Dirtybomb,3de8lo,AyresTargayren,2,Wed Jul 15 16:31:16 2015 UTC,Nobody is getting VAC banned in Dirty Bomb.
Dirtybomb,3de8lo,DOGpls,2,Wed Jul 15 16:15:32 2015 UTC,So you play 7-14 games a week and literally every one of them had a hacker in it? I find that hard to believe. Probably because it's not true.
Dirtybomb,3de8lo,CORUSC4TE,0,Wed Jul 15 16:33:53 2015 UTC,"I just played 3 more games just to test it. 2 of the 3 games had an aimbotter in it. One playing Proxy, the other playing Kira."
Dirtybomb,3de8lo,CORUSC4TE,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:58:19 2015 UTC,Point one. So u say u want to be allowed to vote kick anyone in the lobby so as soon as someone is better than u u have the chance to kick him and if ur whole team accepts just one out of the enemy team has to accept it? good lord that sounds dumb to me.   Point 2 VAC isnt in DB yet so if u get DB banned you dont have any vac records left behind.   Point 3 the last patch banned all the unaccepted ascii codes if u saw one with those letters please let the devs know!
Dirtybomb,3de8lo,Gulrotsaft,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:38:13 2015 UTC,"So u say u want to be allowed to vote kick anyone in the lobby so as soon as someone is better than u u have the chance to kick him and if ur whole team accepts just one out of the enemy team has to accept it   No. This is an ad hominem attack. Nothing more. Votes are majority rule. If that were to happen, your team would just vote to keep you in the game. Simple as that. Anything else would be error tolerance.    the last patch banned all the unaccepted ascii codes   Apparently not."
Dirtybomb,3de8lo,thrnee,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:00:59 2015 UTC,I think it should be more than just a majority vote.    I know that friends of mine who used a smiley that wasnt in the game gets blocked from playing if he has it in his tag. If u are sure u saw them in the last days please give the devs the information you have. They will most certainly fix it.

Dirtybomb,3d7qzi,nuclear_turkey,2,Tue Jul 14 13:43:12 2015 UTC,"It's because he was released so blatantly broken.  A common scam among F2P games is to release characters in an overpowered state, let everyone buy it, and then nerf it before the next overpowered character is released."
Dirtybomb,3d7qzi,SteadyFrunkin,-4,Tue Jul 14 20:37:36 2015 UTC,"I'm not going to bother touching the first sentence adn the claim it makes. The 'common' scam you refer to is pretty much only linked to LoL or Dota (never bothered paying attention to which people were bitching about). Prior to Phantom's release people were fine with the way SD did things, but suddenly Phantom comes out and he isn't quite where the community wants him to be (read: in the bin along with Arty) and suddenly the community is acting like SD is evil and being Nexon's shill despite their otherwise good track record with this game. I mean, I could understand if this game was being developed by the same people who created LoL/Dota, but it isn't. Two weeks ago people were praising SD, now suddenly the cool thing is to hate on them and accuse them of money grabbing. This community is starting to approach CoD-Community levels of inconsistency."

Dirtybomb,3d7qzi,flyingepeto,-10,Tue Jul 14 13:00:02 2015 UTC,"I disagree. Phantom is already bad enough when put against advanced players, nerfing his EHP is just going to make him even worse.  Disclaimer: I understand that he does great against low to moderate skilled players, and I understand that most players fit into one of these two brackets, but I do not think his high-level viability should be completely squashed (more than it already is) just so that less practiced players can do better against him."
Dirtybomb,3d7qzi,SquirmyBurrito,7,Tue Jul 14 13:25:13 2015 UTC,"Show me some footage of ""advanced"" players as you call them going against a team with 3-4 Phantoms. I'd love to see it.  Also, what's the scale you're determining ""low, moderate and advanced"" players on...love to see that as well.  It's not any one thing. If you cannot see that the combination of everything that he has makes him unbalanced and OP - especially when there's multiples on a team, then you are either completely blind - or just love playing crutch mercs."

Chances are this doesn't exist, because skilled players generally play against skilled players, and people don't play Phantom much at all in those games because he's pretty bad.  If you've played LoL or Dota2, it's kinda like how Shaco and Riki are OP according to awful as fuck players, but somehow are still virtually never seen in tournaments."

Dirtybomb,3d7qzi,dejecaal,-3,Tue Jul 14 19:31:37 2015 UTC,"No. I'm not going out of my way to find players more skilled than me (I am not an advanced player) so that I can provide you with a video. You want to see how skilled players perform against Phantom? Wait until that new Dirty Cups thing starts and go see how many teams primarily composed of Phantoms you see slaughtering. I give zero fucks if you think I'm saying this as a means of avoiding having to provide proof. I am not going to go out of my way to provide a video for you.

Dirtybomb,3d6wyl,TwoThreeSkidoo,-3,Tue Jul 14 09:14:38 2015 UTC,Teams that lose don't move up the rankings though right? So the teams that lose before Sparks is allowed in might have been at a disadvantage (depends how game changing you think Sparks is.)
Dirtybomb,3d6wyl,DatHutchTouch,3,Tue Jul 14 09:24:50 2015 UTC,"but the enemy teams also didn't have her. its like this: i buy myself a new pc. a month later the vendor starts a promo for that exact build and sells it for half the price. i now could argue that i have that same pc and i want my price reduction. however at the time i bought it, i was fine with the price. for me it seemed like a reasonable request to pay for that much. if i didn't, i wouldn't have it sitting in my home. im not entitled to the new set because i got it with the old.    in the same way we are not entitled to the new set of rules, if the old is still current. just because i lost without sparks doesn't entitle me to more points when she's allowed."
Dirtybomb,3d6wyl,Kroad,6,Tue Jul 14 10:24:31 2015 UTC,Why? Each team would get access to her at the same time
Dirtybomb,3d6wyl,boneknocker,-3,Tue Jul 14 07:31:06 2015 UTC,Because previous teams may have competed and lost without being able to use her? Whereas maybe they would have done better with access to her 100% distance revive.
Dirtybomb,3d6wyl,shermanikk,2,Tue Jul 14 09:22:56 2015 UTC,Teams play one best of three match per week for six weeks. If they decided to allow Sparks then it would be in between one of the weeks. Each team would get equal access to her
Dirtybomb,3d6wyl,LCTR_,-1,Tue Jul 14 09:56:55 2015 UTC,"Ah, gotcha, thanks for clarifying. I thought if you lost too many you were out."
Dirtybomb,3d6wyl,shermanikk,5,Tue Jul 14 10:00:26 2015 UTC,"Except Phantom IS bugged, his sword has 1.5x the visible attack range and theres almost a two second window to wiggle your mouse and deal full damage even after you miss the initial thrust. On top of 1 hitting half of the classes in the game and dealing absolutely ludicrous damage to others."
Dirtybomb,3d6wyl,Kush-proGoD,8,Tue Jul 14 00:49:13 2015 UTC,it's a feature

Dirtybomb,3d6wyl,SquirmyBurrito,0,Tue Jul 14 08:39:01 2015 UTC,I would have to say that his katana hitbox is bugged.
Dirtybomb,3d6wyl,S_Alchemy,3,Tue Jul 14 03:50:30 2015 UTC,"People need to realize that phantom isnt that strong anymore once he faces an organized team. The reason everybody is able to pubstomp with him is simply that there is 0 communication between the teammates,which is(ofcourse) different in a league match. I doubt he will be played a lot"
Dirtybomb,3d6wyl,SquirmyBurrito,14,Tue Jul 14 00:31:10 2015 UTC,i really don't think you have played any one who is good play phantom. kek10 + 195 hp is too good.
Dirtybomb,3d6wyl,S_Alchemy,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:45:26 2015 UTC,"195 health until you fire a bullet or swing your melee weapon. As soon as you do that, you're back to 120. Best case scenario you get a free bullet or two on one target while everyone else (including your target) pumps you full of lead."
Dirtybomb,3d6wyl,SquirmyBurrito,3,Tue Jul 14 19:00:21 2015 UTC,"thats why most pub players do it wrong. You run in like a normal merc with an smg(best smgkek10) and 120 hp, you trade dmg with whom ever, once you get half hp or lower you turn on your shield and reload while running at them. From there they have 3 choices.    keep firing and hope they have enough ammo in the clip to kill you reload and try to get past the extra 75 hp before he gets to you (you can just reload or melee them ) run away and hope he los before you kill him (prob just going to kek10 him in the back)   But as I was saying, most of you have no idea wtf you guys are trying to talk about. IE you haven't played any one good."
Dirtybomb,3d6wyl,MK43,-1,Tue Jul 14 21:47:29 2015 UTC,"It takes less than a second to drop a person who is down to 60 health. If you some how fail to do so and they manage to cloak, you have several more options:            Swap to your secondary and use that to drop his cloak before switching back to your main weapon to finish him off. Drop his cloak with your primary and finish him off with your secondary. Drop his cloak with whatever and then finish him off with a melee attack. Drop his cloak with a nade, a shot from your sniper rifle, Minigun, shotgun, and then kill him with the rest of the bullets in your primary/Minigun. Reload while backpedaling and wait for his cloak to run out. Run closer to your teammates (if you don't have any teammates near you, you're engaging Phantom in his element, he deserves to have an advantage here).   There are even more options if you have augments like double time.  If you're wondering 'why did he assume I'll have a nade, sniper rifle, minigun, shotgun?' the answer is because if you're trying to engage Phantom in a 1v1, you better be playing as a fellow kill-merc or be prepared to fight Phantom where he has the advantage. 1v1's are his specialty.  I play and play against Phantom regularly. Unlike most others, I do not exclusively use his chopper+katana loadout, I also focus on gunplay. More often than not, if you attempt to activate your cloak in the middle of a gunfight you will fail unless your opponent has shit aim. Maybe the issue isn't that we haven't played anyone good, maybe the issue is just that you're terrible."
Dirtybomb,3d6wyl,boneknocker,4,Tue Jul 14 22:00:26 2015 UTC,"rofl, you have no fucking clue what you are talking about, but hey we can set up a scrim and you can see what it's really like at the high level."
Dirtybomb,3d6wyl,Ballsackologist,0,Tue Jul 14 22:03:37 2015 UTC,What option that I offered was wrong?
Dirtybomb,3d6wyl,Rionstainer,4,Tue Jul 14 22:06:07 2015 UTC,"that every fight is 5v5  that your sidearm can kill about 60hp+75 shield before he reloads and kek10s u  trying to take down 75 hp shield with ""w.e"" and trying to melee a phantom is a good idea  4 doesn't even count that's what you were doing in the first place.  5 he is reloading aswell while running at you he will A. melee you or just reduel with a head start  he doesn't have to follow you, he can just kek10 you with your back turned  how many matches/scrims even pugs have you done? I going to take a guess and say mb 1-2 pugs max."
Dirtybomb,3d6wyl,RazielWarmonic,-4,Tue Jul 14 22:15:49 2015 UTC,"I never said every fight was 5v5. Learn to read, I said you drop his shield with your sidearm and then swap back to your primary. I have melee killed many a reckless Phantom that got too close. Four is still a valid option. Only one of his loadouts comes with double time, and it isn't very good. So how is he going to run at me while reloading? That only works if I run away in a direct line rather than long jumping behind cover before running away. I have just over 200 hours in this game, sure its not much, but it is more than 1-2 pugs like you stupidly claimed."
Dirtybomb,3d6wyl,LCTR_,0,Tue Jul 14 22:26:15 2015 UTC,"Seriously. I was playing a comp match with randoms and had three phantoms on my team. The other team who was queued together smashed us, and they didn't have one phantom."
Dirtybomb,3d6wyl,Ceresss,-4,Tue Jul 14 00:35:01 2015 UTC,focus fire only work on a lone phantom but it another story if they attack your team as 2-3 man cell team.
Dirtybomb,3d6wyl,j4yt3x,4,Tue Jul 14 02:41:28 2015 UTC,Well then I guess we're lucky that the league only allows 1 Phantom per team!
Dirtybomb,3d6wyl,Kroad,3,Tue Jul 14 14:42:02 2015 UTC,"In case a new Merc is introduce during the course of the cup, will you allow them to use him? or are you going for the safe route and ban him? (like in dota 2 were new or reworked heroes are not allow in ranked until they are sure they are not broken)"
Dirtybomb,3d6wyl,wash0ut,2,Tue Jul 14 06:31:30 2015 UTC,"Generally we at least give a 1 week ban for mercs, if anything arises in that time we ban them longer."

Dirtybomb,3d6wyl,Ballsackologist,3,Wed Jul 15 00:01:22 2015 UTC,You should clean up the list of teams a little bit. Quite a lot of empty teams from people who made new ones. Might discourage others from signing up once the limit is reached.

Dirtybomb,3d6wyl,Ballsackologist,2,Tue Jul 14 12:59:47 2015 UTC,All subs need to be on your roster. I'm not sure at what point during the league we're implementing a roster locks at the moment.
Dirtybomb,3d6wyl,FishStix1,2,Tue Jul 14 13:50:13 2015 UTC,"Once the initial sign-ups have finalized, why not just give each team a vote to decide on the ruleset?"
Dirtybomb,3d6wyl,Ballsackologist,3,Tue Jul 14 15:55:34 2015 UTC,"Our ruleset was widely based on feedback during cups, and even before those cups we had test cups to test out things.  This is what we decided on."
Dirtybomb,3d6wyl,FishStix1,2,Tue Jul 14 17:22:27 2015 UTC,It's better if the organizers just come out and say THESE ARE THE RULES. Voting would lead to endless bitching and moaning about trivial shit.
Dirtybomb,3d6wyl,S_Alchemy,2,Tue Jul 14 16:24:34 2015 UTC,Random questions   What are you plans to combat hackers and deal with accusations without a reliable spectator/demo system? How will players deal with the glitchy-ness of the map selection screen (choosing something random instead of the voted map) / the off chance that the map that has been assigned for play does not appear on the vote list?

Dirtybomb,3d6wyl,noisuf,3,Tue Jul 14 01:18:19 2015 UTC,Every league I've played in has a default day and time if teams cannot agree on one.

Dirtybomb,3d6wyl,kogelvrij,2,Tue Jul 14 03:44:32 2015 UTC,Not really sure why you guys keep throwing money into tournaments when there is no working and reliable anti-cheat system in place.
Dirtybomb,3d6wyl,aSheepamongWolves,2,Tue Jul 14 03:54:25 2015 UTC,Feel free to refer to my earlier comment regarding this.
Dirtybomb,3d6wyl,Ceresss,3,Tue Jul 14 04:28:35 2015 UTC,"Sounds neat, though can't say I'll be putting a team together for this. Short notice and matches start right after reg lock, seems like poor planning. Also no mention on how the server process will work. Not sure if you're assuming people know , but if you're intention is to scale you should probably make it more clear in the information."
Dirtybomb,3d6wyl,aSheepamongWolves,4,Tue Jul 14 00:26:24 2015 UTC,I agree - one week might be too short notice for some teams to form and get some practice in. Is it possible to delay it one week to give more people a chance to get organized?
Dirtybomb,3d6wyl,Ceresss,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:01:34 2015 UTC,"Practice wasn't really my main concern. It's the lack of information they have provided and the short period of time before it starts. Seems like they kind of just had this idea, and didn't really care to iron everything out before throwing up the premade league system. One of my many concerns was how the server process works. After looking into more it looks like they (in the past) just assign a server to people and tell people the IP/password. Listening to the stream he posted, which came off more as self-promotion than an actual helping device, it seems like they are trying to gauge the number of teams and work with grabbing a certain number of servers that way. It still sounded like he didn't know.  I hope they do well because I'd like to see a real competitive scene for this game, but there's just too many gray area's for me to want to invest much time into these leagues/events that seem like they would be more frustrating and confusing than fun. Perhaps when the ability for players/teams to have their own private servers, things won't be only left to ""mom and pop"" tournaments/leagues and have something a lot more stable/concrete.   I hope you guys that work with Dirtycups don't view the comments I'm leaving as flaming, but more a little constructive criticism because what you do is not easy, I know. I do appreciate it.  ** edit ** definitely enjoying the downvotes without anyone actually replying to the comment, makes sense"
Dirtybomb,3d6wyl,Oottzz,3,Tue Jul 14 06:34:38 2015 UTC,"We've been planning this for weeks. We were set to announce last week, however we hit a snag and had to come up with our own League site as opposed to one we were going to use.  We had a deadline for when we wanted this to end; unfortunately that means yes you only have a week to enter and sign up, but it's a relatively short season to test out and get a feel for how the community reacts to a league system vs. a pure cup system.  So do not worry, there will be more leagues in the feature with more features / implementations, more rules, and fun stuff! :)"

I'm sorry Oen came off feeling that way, as I was preoccupied with other things (such as making dinner) to actually watch his stream. :("

Dirtybomb,3d6wyl,jerichopchd,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:36:30 2015 UTC,"Since it is competitive wouldn't it be better if everyone just get's the same loadout, like the starter loadout? Make it even for everyone or the perk system isn't seen as a advantage? Thank in advance"

Dirtybomb,3d6wyl,Kroad,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:38:23 2015 UTC,Everyone who is competing in those events should have bought the loadouts for his/her classes with ingame currency or real money already. A loadout costs 17.5k credits so it shouldn't be a problem at all.

Also, since when have faster attacker times been a bad thing? her revive gun makes attacking a whole lot easier; which is a good thing imo.  Just unban here already..."

Dirtybomb,3d6wyl,DixonYamouf,6,Wed Jul 15 01:53:33 2015 UTC,"No matter what kind of Anti-Cheat is implemented, cheaters will still exist. Even ESEA, who probably has one of the best AC systems in the business, has cheaters playing in pugs, scrims & matches. The unfortunate truth is that unless it's a LAN tournament with paid referees, there's always a chance of cheats being involved (even then, there's a possibility). We try to deal with cheaters as best as we can but even once the new AC is implemented by Splash Damage, we'll still have to work just as hard to investigate."

Dirtybomb,3d6wyl,DatHutchTouch,1 point,Tue Jul 14 04:27:00 2015 UTC,"LOL sorry to say ,but you are verrrrrry wrong my friend . First of all Hots is not in open beta no more for awhile. When Hots was in open beta it was only getting thousands not no fucking 10k lol . Go re do ur research , in plus look who made hots .   :/ stick to fps my friend before talking about mobas"
Dirtybomb,3d6wyl,Siegfried_Eba,0,Tue Jul 14 21:12:05 2015 UTC,"Soz pal, never knew you were an esports guru... Who said I did any research anyway? Eh!? The fact you're making an assumption regarding single tournaments and not the net total then you're slightly deluded. In plus? WTF is in plus....??  Yes Blizzard made HotS, but why does that change anything? It's still a new game with shit loads of money being pumped into it, the developer/publisher shouldn't change the fact that games should require prize money to bolster the esport potential.  I think you're missing the point here ""friend"" but you should stick to your own business and think about supporting your lovely mobas and leave us to our FPS games, which IMO are x10 better than any MOBA created, but hey... now we're splitting hairs."
Dirtybomb,3d6wyl,Ultradroogie,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:02:22 2015 UTC,"lol MOBAS make wayyyy more money in esports right now , and yes i do know about hots i played it comp , and made it high  level . if you want i can send you some vods., but i also love playing fps . im just saying dont state nothing until you have all your facts right . wasnt no 10k in open lmao ."
Dirtybomb,3d6wyl,DatHutchTouch,0,Wed Jul 15 09:10:44 2015 UTC,"Nah you're alright, I played the game myself.  ""wasn't no 10k in open lmao ."" - You're still talking about a single figured tournament where as I am talking about the entirety of the games life where money has been pumped into it from various sources. It amounts to more than a 4 figure number, I have not once mentioned an amount in one tournament/event as they have varied."

Dirtybomb,3d6wyl,DatHutchTouch,-15,Thu Jul 16 16:19:48 2015 UTC,"""Sparks is still banned"" But not Phantom, does dirty cups admins even play the fucking game?  Downvote all you want you sheeple, doesn't change facts.  ""Except Phantom IS bugged, his sword has 1.5x the visible attack range and theres almost a two second window to wiggle your mouse and deal full damage even after you miss the initial thrust. On top of 1 hitting half of the classes in the game and dealing absolutely ludicrous damage to others."""
Dirtybomb,3d6wyl,SwitchEternal,2,Tue Jul 14 04:14:06 2015 UTC,I wonder if you play competitively. Phantom is virtually worthless in competitive play with two competent teams. No need to ban a useless merc.
Dirtybomb,3d6wyl,nordik1,-2,Tue Jul 14 00:43:23 2015 UTC,"Except he's not, I play pugs very frequently and competitive MM every other day, it's very easy for a phantom to wreak havoc and confusion. ""He's worthless against a coordinated team"" Can be said for every, single merc in the game."

Dirtybomb,3d6wyl,nordik1,4,Tue Jul 14 00:59:50 2015 UTC,Sparks is actually bugged atm (destroys objectives way too fast). Once that bug is fixed she will be unbanned.
Dirtybomb,3d6wyl,DatHutchTouch,-6,Tue Jul 14 05:21:12 2015 UTC,"As is Phantom, read my comments above."
Dirtybomb,3d6wyl,nordik1,3,Tue Jul 14 01:21:34 2015 UTC,Though Phantom is useless in competitive in organized teams (just how many others said this)
Dirtybomb,3d6wyl,SwitchEternal,3,Tue Jul 14 01:44:20 2015 UTC,"Matchmaking is almost always a disorganized shitshow if you're not partied up with friends or are placed on a team with partied up people. The competitive features don't even work yet, silver and even unranked people are matched up against gold and cobalt players all the time. Besides, your argument became invalid once you referred to those who disagreed as ""sheeple."""
Dirtybomb,3d6wyl,nordik1,-2,Tue Jul 14 12:23:17 2015 UTC,"So what would you class as ""competitive"" I haven't played in whatever few cups or cash tournaments due to times, are those conveniently the only games you would call competitive? I do play with friends every time, because fuck solo Q in that shitshow of a MM."
Dirtybomb,3d6wyl,SwitchEternal,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:31:40 2015 UTC,"Competitive as in actually competing in something (tournaments, leagues etc.) - which generally involves strategizing, practicing, and analyzing your practice to prepare for the matches. Not just playing matchmaking with your friends. A phantom will get destroyed by any competent team."
Dirtybomb,3d6wyl,Decem8,-1,Tue Jul 14 06:53:23 2015 UTC,"As will any merc. So is playing machmaking of CSGO not competitive because there isn't a prize at the end? Don't be silly. Also I love how you COMPLETELY skimmed over the facts I pointed out towards him being broken, not just overpowered, but broken."
Dirtybomb,3d6wyl,SquirmyBurrito,1 point,Tue Jul 14 07:00:27 2015 UTC,"Yes, matchmaking in CSGO is a casual mode. It is not competitive. Same with Dirty Bomb. Same with SC2. And any other game that has a ranked matchmaking that doesn't affect any tournament seedings or anything.  Phantom is not broken. He might be a little overtuned at the moment (especially in pubs), but he offers NOTHING to a team. Phantom doesn't provide ammo, health, fast revives, or faster objectives. There are better alternatives to combat only mercs. I'll take a Fragger 100% of the time over a Phantom on my team."
Dirtybomb,3d6wyl,DatHutchTouch,-1,Tue Jul 14 13:52:17 2015 UTC,"Been GE twice, to say its not competitive is laughable. And again skimming over the fact that he's broken, not just overtuned as you say. Sparks is banned for bring broken, why isn't phantom? What about this don't you understand? Am I speaking another language?"
Dirtybomb,3d6wyl,SquirmyBurrito,-1,Tue Jul 14 14:37:37 2015 UTC,"lol. keep living in your dream world where a damage reduction is ""virtually worthless""."

Dirtybomb,3d6wyl,SquirmyBurrito,2,Tue Jul 14 08:49:35 2015 UTC,"Look, if you can't figure out how having a damage reduction is helpful in a shooter, I can't help you. Invisibility guarantees a good player first shot in almost every engagement, even if someone gets the drop on you the shield tanks that damage. That you've only witnessed garbage players playing Phantom like garbage does not change that he's got a ridiculously large health pool, great short to mid range weapons and stupidly broken CQC abilities.  This may surprise you but even in a ""team setting"" the most important thing you have to do is kill the enemy team."

Are we going to see dedicated server files available or will it be available ONLY through server companies like gameservers.com? Are we going to be able to administer un-ranked servers with complete customizable server configs for league rules and regs? What is the relationship with Xigncode and the SD devs? Is this an outsourced type of AC setup or is Xigncdoe an in-house deal? Do you plan to stick with Xigncode for the duration instead of using punkbuster and/or VAC? What are the planned processes for reporting hackers and/or keeping them out? Does Xigncode support any kind of report streaming for sharing caught hacker GUID's across multiple servers? Are there currently any plans for any expansion packs? Is the game going to support community made mods and/or maps? How many maps are currently in development that we have not yet seen?

I had 10 fairly even matches, 1 where it felt like pub stomping. 0 hackers, and in all the games, it felt like both teams were actively trying to complete the objective and win. When I finally placed I was put at Gold 4 (no idea if that's good or bad, but I did fairly well in my placement matches so it can't be too terrible).

I'm lucky if I can get 3 matches in before crashing with no error. 10 minutes ago I had 2 minutes left in the match and we were winning and lost all that sweet XP. This started happening as soon as the big Phantom update came out. If I crash as soon as I join a game, I'll just try again but it's getting to the point where I take a several hour break after crashing at the worst time possible. It's frustrating as hell.  Crashes happen for me: 2-4 minutes left before match ends, cutscene after I win/lose a match, and crash during the initial objective cutscene."

During double credits weekend, I lost so many matches due to crashing that I stopped playing and waited for the event to be over with. The only thing that reduced my crashing was if I ran the game in Fullscreen>Borderless.

I'm with you though amigo, I thought execution mode would be weird in this game which was not designed to be like CS at all, but in my experience it worked really well and I had loads of fun.

Dirtybomb,3db9yq,dejecaal,-2,Tue Jul 14 23:52:46 2015 UTC,"There is no effective way to play the class.  If you're insinuating that the ""real"" Phantom playstyle is to use the KEK and just frag everyone because lel shield OP, you're sorely mistaken.  Yes, it's more effective against players who know how to play against Phantom than rushing at them with the sword and dying over and over again, but that doesn't make it a good strategy. You're still a 120hp chump with no special in-combat abilities and only an SMG, who should be playing Fragger or Skyhammer or Nader or something instead."

Dirtybomb,3db9yq,INI_Fourzero,8,Wed Jul 15 04:12:55 2015 UTC,"Now add Red Eye to the club and realize how bad Phantom really is when you're playing against a good team that also happens to have eyes / ears + a good Vassili using his sensors.  I kill all kind of Phantoms, hell, some level 45 guy was getting smashed hard as well. He's just a pubstormer because people don't listen for his sound or even look for him at all.  To those who think nerfing his shield / katana will make it any better for you - you're only fooling yourself. Every good Phantom uses the cloak + KEK-10, not the dumb katana that only works against potatoes.  The main issue is that they released him too early without adding some other counters for him so most people struggle to fight him."

Dirtybomb,3db9yq,yousirnaimelol,2,Wed Jul 15 00:45:13 2015 UTC,"I think that having to decloak would make him completely terrible. I think that they should take away the tanky part of his cloak, make him full stealth, and reduce his health to 80, like Aura."
Dirtybomb,3db9yq,ElementB,2,Wed Jul 15 02:06:37 2015 UTC,I would also find that acceptable if the cooldown was increased a little more.

I don't have a problem spotting or hitting a phantom. The problem I have once I spot him and he is rushing me is how he can just eat all of my bullets and then I have to reload or switch to my pistol while he still has full health and if he is smart actually will use his SMG (Kek 10) instead of going for melee only
Dirtybomb,3db9yq,Terr_,3,Wed Jul 15 01:26:40 2015 UTC,"The problem is that buffing him for his ""intended purpose"" would make his ""unintended purpose"" even more OP in most games.

Once i get the BiS loadout via trade up at higher tier, then I'll use the BiS Bronze to continue trading up for other toons.  but no seriously, it's a long grind. like really long. Don't do it to get your base loadouts...ever."
Dirtybomb,3d7hse,KStu82,11,Tue Jul 14 03:00:30 2015 UTC,"I'm not against it, per se, but with the minimal payoff I don't think it sounds worth doing on its own, and should probably bundled as a minor improvement into some larger revamp of the loadout/inventory system.  Right now ""picking the same merc again"" actually serves a different purpose, it's the most convenient way to swap the ordering of your 3 picks when in the lobby."
Dirtybomb,3d7hse,Terr_,1 point,Tue Jul 14 07:45:20 2015 UTC,"You could still swap them by picking the same loadout card as you already have, that merc would only be added to the second slot with a different loadout. Most of the time when you swap them, at least 1 of them is going to have the same loadout as before anyway (usually both)."
Dirtybomb,3d7hse,rollerfiesta,4,Tue Jul 14 12:36:41 2015 UTC,"Wouldn't it just be more intuitive to revaml the entire loadout system? So we could have muliple loadouts or something for the mercs we have selected? Because minimalizing the mercs we can play as during a game to 3 is clunky to begin with, allowing people the ability to completely dismiss characters is only worse."

Dirtybomb,3d7hse,Ghosthree3,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:10:20 2015 UTC,"I get both sides of this argument; however, allowing 2 loadouts for the same merc would allow for deeper strategizing, without affecting the balance of the game (imo), regardless of whether that second loadout took up another slot in your squad or not.  And players that already use 3 different mercs in their squad still could. It wouldn't reduce their strategic possibilities at all."

Since some cards are stronger on offense, taking them on stopwatch can also NOT work once in defense, making it fairer for everyone on the team :P  But I do agree you should be able, before spawning, choose your loadouts. My pc is so slow that just the time the lobby loads and the game starts, I can't switch loadouts : that sucks balls"
Dirtybomb,3d7hse,Stuhlgewitter,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:15:31 2015 UTC,"I speak as someone who has only a passing interest in comp DB and has not participated, but my understanding is that they generally have a one-of-each-merc-per-squad rule. Given that, I would imagine that in the comp setting this would be helpful, as players may wish to adjust their play style without switching off a merc they have been assigned for that match."
Dirtybomb,3d7hse,Stuhlgewitter,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:41:39 2015 UTC,"I can definitely see it going both ways for competitive, since you don't want to be too flexible, but you also want to see a good variety of mercs being played.  But for pubs, it's already fairly common (from what I've seen) for people to only use 1 or maybe 2 of their mercs, either because they don't have any others that they like, or because they like those 1 or 2 so much. Adding this feature would give a use for their 3rd loadout slot.  People that already use 3 mercs could still do that, it wouldn't reduce their flexibility at all. It would simply add flexibility to those who use less than 3 mercs on a regular basis, thus making them more beneficial to the team without them having to play mercs they don't enjoy quite as much."
Dirtybomb,3d7hse,pieceoftost,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:21:46 2015 UTC,"i don't know if picking the same merc with different loadouts is necessarily in the spirit of the game. the entire point is to have all mercs be situational in general and then with more specialized roles based on the loadout. I could see a system like this killing the variety of the game where players would just use mulitiples of one merc they really really like rather than have a handful they enjoy based on the current objective. if you need to switch your focus to defense, then bust out your rhino. if you need to get a quick plant, get your proxy out. i'd hate to see a guy on my team with 3 slightly different skyhammers.  i think the game is currently set-up to encourage you to get really good with a handful of mercs rather than just totally grind it out with one merc."
Dirtybomb,3d7hse,slider2k,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:10:22 2015 UTC,"I agree that 3 of the same merc could be too much, but many mercs have a couple loadouts that change their playstyle a fair amount  (especially those with 2 primary types, like SMG/Shotgun). Restricting it to 2 loadouts per merc, thus forcing at least 2 different mercs into a squad, could work well. You could still have the potential for offensive/defensive mercs, and have 1 of them specialized for your specific situation.  As far as using multiples of one merc they really really like, that's better than using 1 loadout of a merc they really really like and having 2 dead loadout slots (something that I'm sure many people do already)."
Dirtybomb,3d7hse,croshd,0,Tue Jul 14 20:12:41 2015 UTC,"Could you give an example of a character that has several viable loadouts that are good in different scenarios? I honestly can't think of one.  Also, the downside to that suggestion would be teammates with two Vassili loadouts and even less potential medics and engineers on the team. In public play, you're usually a liability to your team if you can't at least fit 3 out of 4 roles."
Dirtybomb,3d7hse,Inkorp,2,Tue Jul 14 03:42:14 2015 UTC,"There was a post on this subreddit yesterday talking about the best loadout(s) for each class. It includes alternatives for different situations.  One good example is SawBonez. If he is someone's favorite character, they could very likely play nobody except him. However, having the two loadouts listed on that page in their squad allows them to choose between a heavy support-based loadout, or if their team already has a lot of medics, they can swap out for a more combat oriented SawBonez."
Dirtybomb,3d7hse,croshd,5,Tue Jul 14 04:05:43 2015 UTC,"I was involved in the creation of that chart. Alternate loadouts on that thing are almost always sidegrades that do not actually offer a different playstyle or an advantage in specific situations. They're mostly a matter of personal preference (shotgun vs SMG, drilled vs lock-on, etc).   Besides, if you really want to ""main"" a specific class, it would probably be detrimental to switch weapons and perks regularly. I wish the loadout system would provide the sort of variety that you're looking for, but unfortunately it really doesn't in most cases, so I'm happy it at least forces some class variety right now."
Dirtybomb,3d7hse,Inkorp,4,Tue Jul 14 04:23:21 2015 UTC,"I honestly don't think this is a huge problem but I do have an example. (at least for me) proxy with an smg or a shotgun give vastly different playstyles, I at one point really wanted to have them at the same time simply because I love proxy. It would also be a nice feature in casual lobbies just for comparing how well you preform with different weapons."

Dirtybomb,3d92uk,DOGpls,5,Tue Jul 14 13:41:19 2015 UTC,"There are still issues with identifying the player and the server. Since the player's name is taken from Steam, you end up with hackers having those weird squares and no way to trace back their steam profile. I just met a Vassili who went 37/0 with 37 bullets fired, all in the head. I got screenshots but they are worthless because I also didn't remember the server's name (a EU - Objective 7v7)  We couldn't votekick him because people in our team don't care, they want the win. And votekick wasn't fixing anything, we really need ingame reporting and SD/Nexon to actually do something about that."

No studio/publisher that truly cared about the players, would release a F2P FPS without a proper anti-cheat system!  Only now, they are ""prioritizing"" it, but the game has been in development for at least 4 years....  Maybe because the servers are infested with cheaters and players have started thinking better before spending money in an appalling experience."
Dirtybomb,3d92uk,y999hoo,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:28:20 2015 UTC,The way it works is you give the name - or describe the name - of the player and give the time and server you were playing in and they can find what steam ID it was.
Dirtybomb,3d92uk,Ghosthree3,2,Tue Jul 14 20:11:16 2015 UTC,"Realistically the only way to end this hacking issue is for people to enmasse stop playing the game, if they see a huge drop in player base, they will do absolutely everything to fix the hacking issue because those player numbers get reported to Nexon who publishes and they shitcan games all the time.

Dirtybomb,3dcx5q,infamousNL,3,Wed Jul 15 07:59:01 2015 UTC,"No, I don't think it is - or, at least, it's gaining players at the same rate that it's losing them. We don't know what the player numbers would have been without the Phantom update, so it's hard to speculate either way.  However, the anecdotal evidence shows an awful lot of unhappy players, and people may just be waiting it out to see what SD do about the class.   My friends are relatively happy playing the game now, for example, because it's possible to find servers with no Phantom players. I don't think any of them will stick around if something isn't done soon, though - the game's good, but it's not quite good enough to retain them if they have to change servers every 2-3 games to avoid the one class they hate playing against."
Dirtybomb,3dcx5q,thefoam,1 point,Wed Jul 15 08:14:34 2015 UTC,"I'm not happy about phantom either, I leave a server if I have to play against him. Purely because if he kills me, it just feels cheap. It's not skill, but he was able to flank us because he can't be seen. It's just a cheap thing.  edit: I will stick around, but they have to do something about him. Maybe make him invisible at a longer range (so you are able to flank with him) but on a shorter range they should make him more visible than he currently is."
Dirtybomb,3dcx5q,infamousNL,1 point,Wed Jul 15 08:26:10 2015 UTC,"Besides better balancing his abilities, they need to do something to raise the skill cap for playing him. A good player can destroy an opposing pub team, while an average player... can still destroy an opposing pub team. With any other class they'd blend into the background."

The faster a Phantom is moving the more visible he is while cloaked. There's a visual distortion that pretty much every player over level 10 I've played have no trouble spotting. He's only completely invisible when standing still. He also generates an audio whir when moving while cloaked which should tip you off even if he's approaching from behind. Nerfing his invisibility would, frankly, make him useless at doing what he was intended to do (flank) and leave him only with the unintended yolo w + m2 shielded charges."

Dirtybomb,3dcx5q,CORUSC4TE,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:25:37 2015 UTC,"There was no other alternative. You can't include data from before the patch went live since that will not show the effect of the patch. Also effects of big releases with marketing are usually visible within a short time frame. You can't draw long-term conclusions, but you can judge immediate responses to the release. In this case you can view it as an apathetic response overall or a combination of new player influx and existing players leaving."
Dirtybomb,3dcx5q,tripleomega,2,Thu Jul 16 17:19:22 2015 UTC,"As a counter, I started playing yesterday so I obviously have no previous frame of reference.  I think this game kicks ass, I don't own phantom and honestly don't have much of a problem dealing with them.

Dirtybomb,3d5a03,alizaman,15,Mon Jul 13 17:10:01 2015 UTC,"As long as there are also always ""no party"" servers available, I wouldn't mind seeing this as well.  (Even more tedious than trying to pubstomp with your friends is joining a random match and getting raped by said pubstompers...)"
Dirtybomb,3d5a03,pnellesen,3,Mon Jul 13 17:59:14 2015 UTC,"furthermore, if there's focus on matchmaking being done, I think that skill-based queues should be a priority feature over a party system."
Dirtybomb,3d5a03,qrokodial,9,Mon Jul 13 21:59:57 2015 UTC,"We are thinking about it, but there are some inherent problems with making this work on non ranked servers in a secure way that does not allow attackers to harm servers.  So no ETA on it, but we're thinking about some solutions."
Dirtybomb,3d5a03,mitsuhiko,2,Mon Jul 13 20:39:50 2015 UTC,I like playing with my friends as much as everyone else - but please only match groups with other groups.   I really don't want to see you guys implement a system that has you dropping in a 5-man mumble-enabled team vs. a bunch of randoms.
Dirtybomb,3d5a03,packtloss,1 point,Tue Jul 14 12:32:29 2015 UTC,thats interesting. any insight on why this was doable for competitive play but more difficult for public play?
Dirtybomb,3d5a03,mitsuhiko,7,Mon Jul 13 20:45:04 2015 UTC,Because competitive play is not join in progress.
Dirtybomb,3d5a03,mitsuhiko,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:50:32 2015 UTC,Is there no way to restrict the would-be party feature to not join sessions in progress but rather those that are in the pre-game lobby/vote screen?
Dirtybomb,3d5a03,SirUndead,29,Mon Jul 13 20:55:37 2015 UTC,"That fundamentally would not change anything.  The ranked servers have a very elaborate state machine that manages a server lifecycle.  Clients join, go through various states that either result in an entire game session or the server recycling back to the pool if certain conditions are not met.  For regular quick join games you just join a single server.  The way this works is that you as the client create a short living reservation.  If you get one you have the slot guaranteed for a timespan which allows you to load into the map and server and then not being bumped out from the server by someone loading faster than you.  For group joins we would have to allow you to make reservations for other players which is a security issue as each player can only have one reservation.  If we allow multiple reservations per player then we allow evil people to block out entire servers.  If we require the okay from another player for creating a reservation then we need to use peer communication to negotiate this which is a fairly elaborate process.  So in short: the problem is a bit more complex than it might appear and it does not happen in ranked matchmaking because of how the system works there."
Dirtybomb,3d5a03,redeyeddragon,7,Mon Jul 13 21:01:15 2015 UTC,Wow! Official words transparently explaining the situation in terms normal folks can understand! Think I'm gonna marry Splash Damage. Thanks a bunch for taking the time.
Dirtybomb,3d5a03,FUNExtreme,-1,Mon Jul 13 21:48:08 2015 UTC,They seem like the kind of studio I am trying to build. I would almost shut my studio down for a chance to work with them
Dirtybomb,3d5a03,mitsuhiko,2,Tue Jul 14 09:26:50 2015 UTC,"A party would require some sort of lobby. So wouldn't it be possible for that party/lobby leader to initiate a join request not as a player but as the party, making the party a separate entity. This way the server would get one join request (with the information of that party, the amount of players in it. So it can find an appropriate server) at which point the selected server can INVITE the players from that party instead if the players requesting access. That way the server is authorative and no trust relationship has to exist between the party leader and the server. There would also be no need for a specific player to be able to create a reservation for multiple players. This should be a way around the security issues"
Dirtybomb,3d5a03,FUNExtreme,3,Tue Jul 14 02:57:28 2015 UTC,"And this is why it's not very useful to go into too much detail on reddit, because it will just prompt well intended suggestions which unfortunately do not really help :)  Generally you are not wrong about what you suggest, but you are missing a few key parts about why that was not done which really would go too much into details now :D"
Dirtybomb,3d5a03,mackejn,1 point,Tue Jul 14 06:55:13 2015 UTC,I had a feeling that would be the case. Not knowing code and backend you're working with pretty much sets you up for incomplete or bad suggestions.

Dirtybomb,3d5a03,TrevinoDr,3,Tue Jul 14 13:38:23 2015 UTC,I hate trying to play with my friends who just got the game. They either get into a game with me with lvl 20 phantoms or play alone with noobs.

Dirtybomb,3d5a03,BlackGauntlets,2,Tue Jul 14 01:43:51 2015 UTC,"Joining the server is the easy bit, the issue is staying on the same team. Which should be an easy change - don't alter the teams after a map ends.   Part of the other issue is the amount of time it takes to go from the end of a map to the start of the next.  And then finally, server loyalty. In every game I've played there has been a few servers where you get to build a community over time, there is none of that in the current setup. When will 3rd party servers be available if ever?"
Dirtybomb,3d5a03,jojoMisty,2,Tue Jul 14 12:36:54 2015 UTC,"Yes, the devs have said that they do want to add this feature to the game, but i do not know when they plan on adding it."

Dirtybomb,3d8kht,LLAMATARIANISM,8,Tue Jul 14 10:55:03 2015 UTC,Stoker would also be pretty good against Phantom. Fire bomb an area and he can't easily walk through to one shot your teammates. I'm hoping we get both at the same time! I've wondered if the devs found him less OP because they had these other characters at their disposal while testing him.

Dirtybomb,3d8kht,SowakaWaka,3,Tue Jul 14 17:05:55 2015 UTC,I don't fail to notice him once he's close enough to kill me. It'd be nice to have some way to see him coming before that.
Dirtybomb,3d8kht,LLAMATARIANISM,5,Tue Jul 14 17:12:38 2015 UTC,"Phantom was kind of a special case because his release was delayed by a few days.

Proxy mines are pretty weak when you nerf them even harder absolutely no one will use her. The mine like grenade thing is just an especial trick giving her some what of a chance in a cqc against many people. ET was way slower in the actual movement and pace I believe most things were slower back then and changing DB up upon mechanics out of ET wouldnt make much of a sense.
Dirtybomb,3dcu4f,CORUSC4TE,3,Wed Jul 15 09:19:14 2015 UTC,Good riddance!
Dirtybomb,3dcu4f,Kagekire,2,Wed Jul 15 07:57:32 2015 UTC,Proxy is supposed to be the fastest character in the game. Making her mines slower to use/activate goes against her entire character design.

As of now, i think Arty does need a buff of some kind because, the reasons to pick him over skyhammer aren't very compelling. i think giving him a couple of full auto options would be helpful, but at that point skyhammer and Arty just become clones of each other."

For one, you're never caught tossing ammo packs out, her stations is amazing. Also, her special is amazing comparatively,  the ability to redirect it results in enemies fleeing in and out of cover like fleas and is reliable at killing the initial enemy you land it on.

Dirtybomb,3d5al2,samppaaz,2,Mon Jul 13 19:27:20 2015 UTC,"i liked the BR loadout the most, but maybe i didnt give the semi-auto enough of a chance. Arty can really put a hurt on people if you're aim is on and you're in the groove that game. if you can take more of a support role and keep your engagements medium range or further, then arty is perfectly fine to use. unfortunately, you can play skyhammer in a similar way and be almost as good.  the airstrike is great for killing the EV. you just need LOS and you can nail it safely, as opposed to getting up close to it with SH's beacon."
Dirtybomb,3d5al2,alizaman,4,Tue Jul 14 07:05:03 2015 UTC,"Are you nuts? With targeting as wonky as it is his airstirkes are worse than SH's beacon, which can FULLY DOWN THE EV IN ONE SHOT"
Dirtybomb,3d5al2,wrightosaur,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:34:22 2015 UTC,"If your gameplay is tactical enough and you choose your battles, you can shit on people with the Driess AR.   You just need to be smart enough to not try to finish kills you'll lose when people rush you, and have tactical retreats."
Dirtybomb,3d5al2,Nalrus,4,Mon Jul 13 19:00:32 2015 UTC,"It's definitely a little weak, but gets a lot more effective if you think of it as (essentially) a wide-radius grenade rather than an airstrike.  Don't even try to get mega-kills with it, just spam, spam, spam away on spots you don't want the enemy getting to."

I've played on so many teams without a single medic this past week. Mostly because getting one-shot by Phantom isn't exactly fun when playing a class that doesn't even get kills usually."
Dirtybomb,3d5al2,ControlPhreakk,3,Mon Jul 13 17:43:55 2015 UTC,"I agree, although, every team this week with two Auras has pretty much ensured an instant win, Ghostbro or not. That could be because only the good Auras are left standing, though."

Dirtybomb,3d5al2,zeaud,3,Mon Jul 13 19:40:07 2015 UTC,"the Empire-9 is basicly his makeshift primary. very underutilized, but so strong. Also, You just have to try shotguns, they are very good, and aren't that bad at range (esp. the Ahnuhld) just aim for the head, just as important as any other weapon.   Any loadout with the Empire if you dont appreciate his primaries. His perks are mostly mediocre, so I just use A31 Guardian close assault for the weapons, and perks arent terrible.  I do think he needs some sort of buff, maybe give him a better primary, but honestly, just make his bombs better, and I'd be content"

Dirtybomb,3d5al2,7supersonicfan,8,Mon Jul 13 18:01:52 2015 UTC,Glad there's no phantom. Hopefully it'll stay that way till they fix him.  Free rotation is good too. A real power house mixed in with the lesser knowns of their given classes. Should lead to some fun experimentation.  Also alot of bad Arty's.
Dirtybomb,3d5al2,AlbinoBunny,3,Mon Jul 13 18:21:44 2015 UTC,OMG NICE! I have a cobalt fletcher that i've been wanting to try. I wonder why Arty is back in? wasn't he one of the first mercs to be rotated in?
Dirtybomb,3d5al2,kAndyREW,3,Mon Jul 13 20:13:28 2015 UTC,"They've already rotated everyone else. Next after this one will probably be Kira/Sawbonez, Phantom, Bushwhacker."

Dirtybomb,3d5al2,treycook,8,Mon Jul 13 18:59:19 2015 UTC,Disappointing considering everybody already has fragger with the free pcgamer giveaway and arty is just inferior to skyhammer who everybody also has.
Dirtybomb,3d5al2,Xionix1,48,Mon Jul 13 19:02:09 2015 UTC,I'll take an underwhelming rotation over a frustrating one all day.
Dirtybomb,3d5al2,Nalrus,2,Tue Jul 14 02:49:52 2015 UTC,"But to be fair, we have had two ( arguably ) 'frustrating' rotations back to back. Why not spread worse characters out into the OP rotations to make all the rotations more fair?"
Dirtybomb,3d5al2,Nalrus,4,Mon Jul 13 17:25:09 2015 UTC,That would probably result in people only playing the most cancerous characters within a rotation.
Dirtybomb,3d5al2,Roy_McDunno,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:27:26 2015 UTC,But it still stops them from playing 3 cancerous characters at once.

Dirtybomb,3d5al2,promyy,0,Tue Jul 14 00:31:44 2015 UTC,"Already had Vassili/Rhino in one rotation, that was ""fun"". So was the Nader rotation this one.  I don't think a Phantom rotation would be that bad."
Dirtybomb,3d5al2,SirUndead,2,Tue Jul 14 02:00:17 2015 UTC,"Decent rotation, at least much better than the last two, lol. Hopefully it will help discuss the potential buff for Arty."
Dirtybomb,3d5al2,mr_banhammer,2,Mon Jul 13 17:43:07 2015 UTC,"Well most of us own Fragger thanks to that free Fragger giveaway, and most folks don't really want to play as Arty since most agree he's underpowered until a fix comes in for him, so basically...  The next rotation is Fletcher. Fletcher wouldn't have it any other way, heh.  (I'll probably try Arty out for fun, though.)"
Dirtybomb,3d5al2,ControlPhreakk,2,Mon Jul 13 23:25:01 2015 UTC,Phantom isn't in the free rotation because he hasn't been out for at least 2 weeks yet. In the past new Mercs have been in the following free rotation because that's the schedule we were trying to stick with- since there have been delays on updates the rotation has been affected. Even if there isn't an update we think it's important to keep the rotations bi-weekly. -MissMurder   So Phantom is in the next rotation...?
Dirtybomb,3d5al2,treycook,3,Mon Jul 13 17:50:33 2015 UTC,"Yes, most likely. To be fair though, the changes for Phantom are most likely going to be in a patch that comes out late-July anyway. This way he'll be available for everyone so SD can get some numbers on him after the changes. That's my theory at least."

That is just the basic thing, I mean getting a team that is easy to work with and it just makes the game all around better to play.  Bushwacker and Phantom Combo Now, this is a different one, now this requires the Phantom to be pretty good at playing phantom and the Bushwacker to be really good. See if bushwacker can place a turret at an objective and the phantom runs around taking people out while they are being mowed by a turret its just great. You all know this but, Rhino and ANY HEALER EVER. See Rhino is just amazing, he really is, if you get an Aura healing you while you just camp an entrance to the objective he is almost unstoppable. Really. Try it.  Communication. This is a no shit kind of thing or you would think. See some people can't afford good mics or mics at all, or just all around have a squeaky voice and don't want to be harassed (That is me btw at 15 I have a pretty squeaky voice) I feel like people just REFUSE to chat through the mic, but who cares about a mic.

Maybe a medic with more pushing power, Sawbonez is slower than Aura but he is better at moving around the map to aid his team, he also cost 30k.

Dirtybomb,3d870z,DerpsterJ,3,Tue Jul 14 07:26:14 2015 UTC,This was one of the answers I expected the most. I'm trying to find where the line between people who think there's nothing wrong with him outside of a few tuning issues and people who dislike his presence to the point of not playing is.   I have several friends who all play competitive FPS either now or in the past and I'm one of 10 that're still willing to play since his release.
Dirtybomb,3d870z,DerpsterJ,0,Tue Jul 14 07:28:53 2015 UTC,"I don't mind his presence at all. But I'd mind his presence when half the server is Phantoms, like with Nader now.  He IS going to be tweaked, in his current state he is unbalanced.  As a hole, I do not mind his invis. Not that hard to spot, and you can actually hear him. But I mind his massive HP when using shield and the fact he can one shot 3 people at once with his katana.  Get rid of the shield on the armour and possibly lower the arc on the katana."
Dirtybomb,3d870z,tripleomega,1 point,Tue Jul 14 07:34:18 2015 UTC,"Since Phantom's release I've tried to play DB in two play sessions. In both cases every single game was ruined by his presence. Both in terms of enjoyment and in team score. Even the worst players who made obvious errors constantly were topping the charts. I've since stopped playing entirely, as has a friend of mine. The game is just no longer enjoyable to me. It went from an 8/10 in terms of gameplay to a 3/10 overnight. I'll be back when SD make some balance changes to Phantom."
Dirtybomb,3d870z,croshd,5,Tue Jul 14 09:07:45 2015 UTC,"There is a reason i play Dirty bomb and not Chivalry, so no."
Dirtybomb,3d870z,Terr_,3,Tue Jul 14 07:28:31 2015 UTC,"I'm OK with it as long as it means that they are working on changes, the results of which can then be tested by everyone when he does go into free-rotation."
Dirtybomb,3d870z,TeaL3af,2,Tue Jul 14 08:07:02 2015 UTC,"Well he's quite popular anyway, I usually see at least one each game. Also when he's free any data would be slightly skewed because of how many people would be playing him."
Dirtybomb,3d870z,TeaL3af,1 point,Tue Jul 14 07:18:51 2015 UTC,"One on hand I agree that having an excess of phantom players would likely skew the results.  On the other hand I would argue that the feedback can come in another form - and that's after people have played phantom, how do they feel about him? I wager there's a lot of people who refuse to buy him or can't - but would be willing to weigh in given the chance to try."
Dirtybomb,3d870z,Rexatyr,3,Tue Jul 14 07:22:13 2015 UTC,"Well balanced or not, most people seem to agree that he is just very frustrating to play against. I don't think we need to have a Phantom blitzkrieg to clarify that, and being able to play as phantom doesn't really make him less annoying when you're playing someone else."
Dirtybomb,3d870z,reob33,0,Tue Jul 14 08:59:51 2015 UTC,"I absolutely agree... it doesn't matter whether a merc is balanced or not, facing too many of the same one at once just becomes super annoying, simply because you'll spend most of your time countering them. Free Nader? Have fun spending all game dodging grenades. Free proxy? Better check every single corner of the map because there are going to be mines every five steps.  Free Phantom is going to be even worse because of the ""Phantom OP"" circlejerk, so a lot more people are going to be playing him. Idiots especially. You know, those that spend the entire match running at people in a straight line with their katana drawn and getting kills every once in a while because the enemy's magazine is half empty after a firefight."
Dirtybomb,3d870z,LatrodectusVS,2,Tue Jul 14 10:51:43 2015 UTC,Pretty damn thrilled by it!  I wasn't looking forward to phantom vs phantom: The Phantoming.
Dirtybomb,3d870z,dead_hero,1 point,Wed Jul 15 06:54:13 2015 UTC,"Both.  If they put him in the free rotation, the community outcry would magnify and they would be forced to acknowledge how broken he is.  Now, however, they can sit back and claim that further testing is needed from the community because apparently it takes a month to tell if something is blatantly imbalanced."
Dirtybomb,3d870z,General__Wiggles,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:33:59 2015 UTC,"I agree with OP. I think SD's logic about needing time and data to tweak Phantom rings a little hollow when they could easily place him in the free rotation and get everything they need quickly. As it stands, it looks like there's still quite a bit of money to be made from Phantom, and SD isn't passing that up in favor of game balance."

I'll still have to deal with the p2w phantoms, rather than a horde of f2p phantoms, but it would have been nice to see his effect on the game when everyone has him. the game would be virtually unplayable for 2 weeks and it would have prompted the devs to get their asses in gear in regards to balancing him.  Now I feel like a balance pass for him will take even longer."

Dirtybomb,3d870z,Alphadef,0,Tue Jul 14 12:21:56 2015 UTC,"I think it's fine for him to not be on the free rotation until he's re-balanced a bit and he's also not a good merc to have 5 of on your team.  With that said, I don't think he's that crazy OP or impossible to deal with as people make him out to be. Personally, the thing that makes me not want to play the game is not Phantom but all the people that cry about it the whole match and even go afk because of it. Literally joined a server the other day where somebody was saying ""There's a Phantom in the server, let's all disconnect"". Those people are the cancer of the community and the reason why the game became less enjoyable since the Phantom patch."
Dirtybomb,3d870z,DerpsterJ,-5,Tue Jul 14 09:10:56 2015 UTC,"Personally I think he's fine, and thought so long before I played him, but I wish they would just do something about him already so I can play my favorite character design and playstyle without getting bitched at, because honest I've given up on the idea that enough people are actually going to ""git gud"" enough for them to stop bitching about it."
Dirtybomb,3d870z,Alphadef,4,Tue Jul 14 07:16:19 2015 UTC,"You do realise you are setting yourself up for a lot of flak now, right?  If you don't see the problem with Phantom and people just need to ""git gud"", you're in denial."
Dirtybomb,3d870z,chrisorange,-6,Tue Jul 14 07:40:24 2015 UTC,"I most certainly am setting myself up for a lot of hate thanks to the phantom op hivemind. But honestly if a player with pretty average aim and 10fps can easily deal with phantom, I want to know what everyone else's excuse is."
Dirtybomb,3d870z,chrisorange,2,Tue Jul 14 07:46:17 2015 UTC,"I had a situation yesterday where there was no amount of tactics or aim that helped me win vs him. I think I took him to 13% health with several SMG headshots before he finally caught up to me and 1 shot me. That's the only time I've been mad about it.  I played that one as perfectly as I could both aim wise and tactics wise. The only other way that fight turns out is that I hit less headshots and he kills me and keeps more of his health. There was really no way to just win that fight...and you do have to fight because if you run he has one of the best SMG's in the game also he catches up to ANYONE backpedaling.  The only time I can reliably kill a good phantom player is when he uncloaks to swing at team mates and I'm at least 7 ""in game yards"" away from him or if I have walls around to jump and use raw skill to down him before he gets that lucky 1 shot off."
Dirtybomb,3d870z,DerpsterJ,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:13:50 2015 UTC,"Its the embodiment of everything I hate to see in an online video game where something they ARE or have selected in a UI screen just wins and trumps anything you've practiced or are good at.  For example in TF2 I know a sniper that says ""oh ya hitting scout heads is super EASY..."" and he just dumpsters them all the time. It doesn't matter the skill level of the scout or even if the scout is using jump crouch scripts because my friend hits that shot so often and has experience against top players.  So something he is GOOD at trumps the class pick of scout. Most snipers can't hit those same shots. So the comparison to phantom goes like this: nothing you can be ""good"" at will counter a good phantom player besides just hitting heads and even then it's often times not good enough to win that situation because you are often times forced to reload to finish him off which is just enough time for him to get in and 1 shot you."
Dirtybomb,3d870z,Alphadef,3,Tue Jul 14 15:29:19 2015 UTC,"You are ignoring the issues.  Read the sticky on top, the issues have already been explained.  I can handle him just fine, that's not the issue. He is out of balance compared to the other mercs."
Dirtybomb,3d870z,DerpsterJ,-4,Tue Jul 14 07:49:08 2015 UTC,"I'm having trouble with figuring out how exactly. The only arguements I agree with are the melee issues (like bey blade) and gun balance, but gun balance is gun balance not merc balance."
Dirtybomb,3d870z,Alphadef,4,Tue Jul 14 07:51:21 2015 UTC,"Invis Merc with effectively more HP than the tank, equipped with the best SMG in the game, fast, AND can one shot half the mercs while being invis.  Normally when you create an invis merc/character, you balance it with him being weak. That's not the case here. He is incredibly strong.  Lower his HP and remove the shield on the armour, that should do it.  MAYBE lower the arc on the katana, he can one shot 3 people at once."
Dirtybomb,3d870z,DerpsterJ,-3,Tue Jul 14 07:53:46 2015 UTC,"The cloak could use some bleed, and the melee mechanics are stupid. I'll give you that much. But the smg issue is not a phantom issue. That is a gun balance issue. Take the nerf to the gun not the merc. As for his bulk, either pick fairly bulky, or complete inivisibility in a game with exactly 1 (planned 2/3) detection methods. Because a melee character needs one or the other."
Dirtybomb,3d870z,TeaL3af,5,Tue Jul 14 07:58:11 2015 UTC,"There is no gun balance issue, that's not what I am saying.  You need to take all the strengths in context, can't just single out one thing."
Dirtybomb,3d870z,NamelessLiberty,2,Tue Jul 14 08:02:09 2015 UTC,"I mean... W+M1 phantoms (IE most phantoms) aren't hard to deal with. The problem is the actual decent players playing phantom.   Lets say a phantom comes around a corner with his cloak up and he's about 7-8m away. If you backpedal and shoot, he has enough effective hp to get close and stab you to death, even if you are playing a fast character like Proxy he can still long jump into melee range and 1-shot you. To prevent him from closing the distance the only thing you can do is equip a melee weapon and long jump and/or run away to gain distance.  If you do try to gain some distance first, he can use the opportunity to switch to his Kek-10 and start shooting you. It's now a gun fight but he's probably already stripped 30-50% of your hp before you can start firing back.  Basically it takes an average player to beat a bad phantom, a good player to beat and average phantom and an excellent player to beat a good phantom. He isn't impossible to deal with, he just requires a huge amount of effort to beat compared to the effort required to play him."

Dirtybomb,3das67,PrivateHazzard,4,Tue Jul 14 20:49:11 2015 UTC,I use his turret as more of a tool to deny the enemy progress. Put it in a good choke point and you'll not only slow them down but also see when people are trying to flank you.
Dirtybomb,3das67,Shabongbong130,3,Tue Jul 14 21:05:27 2015 UTC,It's also good for lowering the TTK on enemies while you shoot them too.
Dirtybomb,3das67,LLAMATARIANISM,5,Tue Jul 14 21:19:52 2015 UTC,"I actually want bug-fixes and quality-of-life changes first.   Let us rotate it before placing, so I can push it snugly into corners. (Just like in TF2.) Ensure that the ""Lock On"" and ""Sturdy"" bonuses actually have a positive effect. Show a clear indicator of it's range and arc for detecting enemies before I place it. Show me an HP bar for my own turret through walls. I can already tell when it's being attacked, but I can't tell how bad it is. I think it sometimes gets stuck facing the ""wrong"" direction after tracking an enemy. It should eventually turn back to the direction I wanted it to guard.   After that, we can revisit whether it needs a buff or nerf."
Dirtybomb,3das67,Terr_,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:22:59 2015 UTC,What do you mean by sturdy and lock on not really having positive effect?
Dirtybomb,3das67,DutchCone,1 point,Sat Jul 18 06:19:49 2015 UTC,"I haven't tested it myself, but several people have claimed one or both are bugged and don't do anything. It's worth checking, since there are other bonuses that much-more-clearly don't work, like Flying Pig."
Dirtybomb,3das67,Terr_,3,Sat Jul 18 06:28:09 2015 UTC,"I think it's pretty good as it is. You have to think of his sentry as you would the mini-sentry in TF2. It's not powerful enough to shut down an area on its own, and therefore you can't just put it up as a wall to multiple opponents. It's meant to supplement Bushwacker's moderate combat strength in order to achieve area denial.  A Bushwacker player who knows the maps well, and can place sentries in surprise flanking positions is extremely effective."
Dirtybomb,3das67,ArmsAkimbo,3,Tue Jul 14 21:44:08 2015 UTC,"His 'shtick' is being an engineer with decent hp and great weapons.  The turret is perfect the way it is imo. Place it in a sneaky location and it will destroy people, especially in high pressure situations, but it's not so strong that it's a huge frustration to deal with."
Dirtybomb,3das67,Tarqon,2,Tue Jul 14 20:56:42 2015 UTC,They can buff it by making Lock-On and Sturdy actually do something.  Currently they're completely useless.
Dirtybomb,3das67,4812622,2,Tue Jul 14 21:34:25 2015 UTC,"I think he's fine as he is. I play as Bushwhacker quite a bit and you have to take the class as a whole. Some of his loadouts have the Kek-10, which I feel is a strong SMG and he's an engineer so he's good for pushing objectives.   His turret isn't great for area denial, but more as a speed bump. Place it around the corner in a choke point and you'll probably get a Proxy or medic that runs in. Anyone with more health can probably take it out, but you'll get a lock notice and you can see that your turret is dead, so you know they're approaching from that side.  I haven't played a loadout with the lock-on buff yet (is it working?), but I imagine that helps his turret quite a bit. If he was to get a buff, it should be very small -- maybe 15% improvement to base turret lock on time or having the turret ""detect"" targets when they're in line of sight (even if they aren't locked on) and within a short range (similar to Vassili's heart beat sensor)."
Dirtybomb,3das67,typodaemon,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:39:42 2015 UTC,"Turret placement is key, it comes with experience and map knowledge. It can be a bit frustrating that it's so easily taken out from long range (snipers especially) but that's mostly due to poor placement.  As for the lock on, i guess they meant to balance that with the perk. But loadout discussion is another beast entirely."
Dirtybomb,3das67,croshd,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:28:42 2015 UTC,"Bushwacker's turret is really good, it's essentially a 2nd merc although its stationary nature makes it easy to hit/kill. placement is absolutely Key to its effectiveness and setting it up in ambush spots is how Bushwacker is supposed to be played. However the ability to lock on and fire at cloaked phantoms and through Redeye Smoke would be pretty cool as i imagine the target acquisition is Thermal/Infrared based like Redeye's eyepatch although maybe at a slower lock on speed (as the turret takes a moment to confirm the enemy through the interference) to encourage more strategic placement and wouldnt make phantom's/ Redeye's abilities entirely useless against Bushwacker"
Dirtybomb,3das67,nishahusky,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:51:18 2015 UTC,not at all.... and Ive played Bushwhacker more than anyone.  theres just a lot of bad bushwhackers out there who put the turret in silly places.  location is key.

I also am not too big of a fan of the empire because it feels like I'm shooting marshmallows at people.  That being said, I player Fletcher with a ""peekaboo"" style, popping in and out of corners sneaking shotgun shots in and throwing stickies.  I mostly use the empire to cover c4 from defusers at a distance, but I try to avoid long range combat altogether because that's Fletcher's weak point."

Dirtybomb,3dah9l,Roy_McDunno,2,Tue Jul 14 20:55:43 2015 UTC,"Hm. For free I know the ""Video Pad Video Editor"". It is not very big, but it might be a bit hard to get the hang of it, but once you understood it, making/cutting videos should be relatively easy, as far as I experienced it. It has some pretty good effects and tools for a free software, too.  However, on longer videos the VPVE tends to freeze and potentially just ""hang up"", as we say in german. Making this for example took me some days for cutting all the small pieces + 1 musictrack. So that might not be the right one for cutting scenes, laying a music-track behind everything + comment + effects.  Oh, and while running, you can take your knife out. This way, you run much faster. And use maybe use walljumps and longjumps (press Crouch-button and press ""jump"" immediately after that. This way, you jump very far, but loose the speed when you land again)"

All dirty cups player will mostly aggree on it if a good sparks is in a pug you dont have to have an engineer for secondary objs she destroys them in roughly 20 seconds. No one is faster at that you might even switch out a skyhammer because she can deal incredible damage to the ev aswell and doesnt have a cooldown on it. She is massively broken and to be honest if she would be allowed i think i would play arty instead of skyhammer for reals. shorter cooldown so taking down the ev with sparks and him is a cake and stronger weapons in his hands. She is a killing and reviving MACHINE no doubt about it. But her damage to objectives is out of hand. You can use her for any xp grinding in public.

Taking our secondary objs can also be done quite fast with kira or nader btw, you don't need an engie there either.  I think games will be very stale with one merc rule but no sparks which is why I disagree with this rule, although ofc the real problem is that SD can't fix this bug which it seems would be really easy to do."
Dirtybomb,3d8o66,Kroad,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:06:33 2015 UTC,Infinite range. Take a arty instead of the skyhammer and he half hits it in 5 seconds while sparks shoots it and need further 10ish seconds to destroy it.   Kira/Arty just can destroy secondary objs that are open air while nader and sparks can destroy them in doors and SPARKS is a medic and nader might be offclass (Utility slot or support slot) so u can have Sparks AND a nader/kira.   I think one merc rule is a great idea as long as u have enough variety and not u have to play Sawbonez AND Aura.

It's more the 'spam forever without overloading' that  bothers me, not so much the EV/Generator thing.  1 Merc rule is silly as all it does is 'force' creativity that's already happening with 1 Assault ruleset.

Dirtybomb,3d8o66,TeaL3af,1 point,Tue Jul 14 12:13:56 2015 UTC,Isn't sparks banned because she can occasionally glitch a player out when reving them?
Dirtybomb,3d8o66,Hutchythesmall,1 point,Tue Jul 14 11:15:08 2015 UTC,I think they fixed that but I'm not sure
Dirtybomb,3d8o66,DerpsterJ,0,Tue Jul 14 11:16:41 2015 UTC,"Sparks is banned because the objective damage she deals, which ain't even that insane unless you do nothing else but shoot the objective.  She can sometimes TK when trying to revive but that's no reason to ban her either, that gives you no advantage rather a disadvantage"
Dirtybomb,3d8o66,DerpsterJ,4,Tue Jul 14 11:17:35 2015 UTC,"I managed to take down an EV, while simultaneously reviving my team around the EV. Repeatedly.  If you have her Loadout card (there's really only one), you revive almost full life with no charge and you recharge 25% faster for shots.

Dirtybomb,3d8o66,Dworgi,1 point,Tue Jul 14 11:55:52 2015 UTC,"This kind of ruleset just shows you the game technically isn't ready for competitive. Not to mention there are next to no bells and whistles for competitive players, the game has super unbalanced functionalities. So much so, the really only competitive tournament feels the need to employ rulesets outside the boundaries of ""fun competition."" I understand Sparks does too much damage to the EV. That's why we should just hold off of these leagues.   Dirtycups is trying to dictate the meta with these rules (Sparks aside, she's broken in that one singular aspect). Deciding only one merc can be on a team seems arbitrary at best, and at worst is DirtyCups trying to set the meta here so to have all vanilla team comps. I don't like it at all.  The map thing would matter more to me if there were more than 5 maps. The problem is people practice maps, and that if you don't give them the benefit of the coin toss to chose to ""pick the map"" or ""attack first"" or whatever DirtyCups would do, it makes it less strategic. Players have their ""best map,"" why remove that strategy from the process?"
Dirtybomb,3d8o66,packtloss,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:01:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah, i've gotta say, i agree with you.  Class limitations are silly. The game is the game. If the game doesn't limit things a competitive match shouldn't either - Especially in cases where splash damage has not expressed any issue with behavior (Sparks EV).  Map selection doesn't bother me so much though. Has there been a trend of one map being played more heavily than others?"
Dirtybomb,3d8o66,Dworgi,2,Tue Jul 14 11:32:20 2015 UTC,"Just because developers lag behind doesn't change the fact that certain mercs nullify certain parts of the game when abused.   In public environments, this doesn't really matter, but why even take mercs that are good at taking down objectives when you can just use a medic (who is already very strong) to do it?"
Dirtybomb,3d8o66,packtloss,0,Tue Jul 14 14:15:45 2015 UTC,"You say ""abused"", i say ""different tactics based on valid game mechanics"".  If a team wants to go all sawbones and try to revive their way through, why not?  Why is that not a valid strategy?"
Dirtybomb,3d8o66,Kroad,2,Tue Jul 14 14:38:17 2015 UTC,"I meant Sparks, personally.   That said, ""valid game mechanics"" have often lead to the complete death of competitive games, because it turns out people don't like being forced to use cheese strats.  That's the real problem with things being overpowered - to be competitive you have to use them, no matter how unfun they may be. Not limiting overpowered stuff doesn't lead to more options, it leads to less."
Dirtybomb,3d8o66,Watsyurdeal,0,Tue Jul 14 14:41:17 2015 UTC,"Oh, sorry.   Regarding sparks, the revive gib is annoying - but if that were the only problem - I would leave it up to teams to weigh that risk:reward. I think the object damage thing is an SD design decision - and therefore a valid mechanic that needs to be defended against.   That said, ""valid game mechanics"" have often lead to the complete death of competitive games, because it turns out people don't like being forced to use cheese strats.   I get it. But on the other hand - It's beta, and stuff like this should be a great opportunity for SD to see if cheese strats develop (or not) and how they react to them. If they let cheese gameplay live on, the writing would be on the wall for this game (as a competitive venue), anyways.  That said - It's their league, and they can run it how they like. It certainly would be interesting to see how the same league ran without class limits."

Dirtybomb,3d8lyb,bucier,1 point,Tue Jul 14 10:39:29 2015 UTC,"In general it's better to just buy the bronze loadout you want, with the weapons you want, and the perks you want. If you spend the same money on cases, you're a lot less likely to get the bronze at all, and especially not for the class you want, and even if you do, it's not guaranteed to be the weapon/perk setup you want.  Cases are more fun though ¯\_(ツ)_/¯"
Dirtybomb,3d8lyb,Koneke,1 point,Tue Jul 14 10:34:14 2015 UTC,"If you have spare cards, then trade up, instead of buying cases. For 9 lead cards and 2,5k credits you can get a bronze card for the merc of your choice.  To get a bronze or better from a case, is a 5% chance. That means (on average) you'd have to buy 20 cases to get a card with 3 perks and even then it would be for any merc.  If you know exactly which loadout you want, then I'd suggest buying it for the 17,5k."
Dirtybomb,3d8lyb,kohalikpagan,1 point,Tue Jul 14 11:09:23 2015 UTC,"Right, or you could buy 9 cases, get (worst case scenario) 9 leads, then spend 2.5k for a random bronze loadout for any character.  So you spent 11.5k for a bronze, if you don't care about the specifics, you'd be doing pretty well.  Obv, if you want a specific loadout, just pay the 17.5k, but otherwise (like if you want to craft silver+ loadouts) it's cheaper to do cases."
Dirtybomb,3d8lyb,Driesens,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:56:57 2015 UTC,Cases are really only worth it once you got everything you need and you want to quickly aquire silver or higher cards. Never buy them to get specific loadouts.

Dirtybomb,3d5csx,SC2_Bench,1 point,Tue Jul 14 06:03:18 2015 UTC,"True, I have noticed footsteps while sniping from up there before. I don't have the perk, though, so they are probably plenty loud already."

Guns really are obnoxiously loud though. Makes listening to footsteps a lot harder. I wish it was possible to tune down gunfire volume while keeping footstep volume the same."

Dirtybomb,3d5csx,Stuhlgewitter,1 point,Tue Jul 14 11:02:19 2015 UTC,Footsteps are sometimes useful. I recall playing Nader and standing in the hallway next to the barrier generator in Underground and listening for footsteps (it was surprisingly quiet) so I could get direct hits.

Dirtybomb,3d5csx,Tiesieman,2,Mon Jul 13 19:20:26 2015 UTC,"Why not? It's good to have class-specific augments. It increases diversity of possible loadout combinations and allows users to weigh their options more carefully; do I want better revives, or longer reach on my healing station?

If X=0 kills, that merc's HP is bumped up a notch, by +10% of the base HP to a max of +30%. If X=1 kill, no change. If X>1 kills, that merc's HP is dropped down a notch for each kill beyond the first, ending at your base HP.  Time you spend as a different merc has no effect, it only counts lives as that merc, and the HP bonus only applies when spawning as that merc. It gets reset if you switch teams or when you hit half-time in stopwatch games.   The exact numbers will obviously need some experimentation to balance."

Dirtybomb,3da9fx,prophetNP,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:09:52 2015 UTC,Remburgh 7 is the strongest shotgun in the game at close range at 96 damage. Combined with Aura's speed she can do great with it if she abuses corners with her healing station. It's also pretty good at repelling Phantoms assuming you can spot em before they get the drop on you.

None of the perks are helpful (lock on doesn't help, springy is not very useful, and you shouldn't be blowing ýourself up so failsafe is pointless too), and the only good weapon is the empire 9.  BL33 is obviously much better than both suggested loadouts.  As for A31, I like it, but objectively it isn't all that great. But at least you get the empire 9 and double time.  Finally, if you're really worried about splash damage A23 would be better. You still get an MP secondary, but you also get unshakable and tough."

The Dreiss loadouts are really only better if you personally prefer the Dreiss over the BR, but the BR is objectively a good weapon (higher dps, and one shots 90 hp and less mercs on hs), and the loadouts for the BR cards are better.  Edit 2: I like the Dreiss too, not shitting on it at all. Brings back memories of DoD and the M1 Garand."

Dirtybomb,3d9wjx,dejecaal,2,Wed Jul 15 02:34:00 2015 UTC,"You can't appeal to everyone with music, but I feel that going with big label pop music (the kind of stuff people hear on the radio all the time) is generally a bad idea. Personally I always find it a bit jarring, although I can't quite put to words why.  Going with less known music or music somehow related to the content at hand (in this case, video games) is what I would suggest. I have a hard-on for chiptune-y stuff with gameplay videos, since there really isn't a genre more related to games than chiptunes. But that's just me.  EDIT: Also, your video doesn't seem to actually have much anything to do with Dirty Bomb aside from the gameplay on the background, which is probably why it didn't have the best reception.  EDIT2: Since you seem to just be starting out with your channel, I'm not sure if making a vlog type series is the best idea. I would imagine people only want to watch the vlogs of people they care about, and if you have a fledgling channel there probably aren't a lot of people who really care to watch your vlogs unfortunately.  EDIT3: Also, all of your videos seem to be kinda long. I understand ""let's play"" type things tend to be longer and they're also very popular on Youtube so maybe that's what you're going for, but my suggestion would be to start off with easily digestable content to draw in a decent viewerbase.  Short videos are easy to watch, and more likely to draw in random clickers-by than 15 minute videos. Things like quick clips of cool moments, short tips & tricks guides, and such would be examples of easy to digest content. If you have the knack for writing, concisely argued 5 or so minute rants can also be an effective way of drawing in random viewers, especially if you title them a bit provokingly. Many of them will only watch the first couple of minutes before angrily going down to the comment box, but it can work. I did a couple of these a year or two back when I was bored and they've gotten a surprising amount of views despite being just a side thing to a channel I don't put much effort to."

I sincerely apologize for the lack on Dirty Bomb besides the gameplay, if you watched the video, the series itself is a personal post-commentary series where I tell life stores, funny moments & all that jazz.

Dirtybomb,3d4kp6,LatrodectusVS,3,Tue Jul 14 05:13:00 2015 UTC,"Bushie is pretty fun if you get the hang of him.  The trick is to derive pleasure from cunning, and you can do some dastardly cunning things with the turret. You want the turret to catch the enemy in the back, preferably while you are getting their attention from the front. They will always focus you, and if you pull it of nicely you can get out a 1v4 situations alive and with a lot of points"
Dirtybomb,3d4kp6,-Halosheep-,2,Mon Jul 13 18:32:33 2015 UTC,That does make it sound more fun. I should give the turret a second chance.
Dirtybomb,3d4kp6,AMasonJar,6,Mon Jul 13 19:50:13 2015 UTC,"Exactly. Most people treat the turret like some guarding sentry.  This is the wrong approach. It doesn´t need that much punishment to die, and can only attack enemies in the designated area, and is easiliy flanked. Bushwacker´s greatest potential comes from combining his own damage with that of the turret simultaniously, so you need to create crossfires with it.   Now, you have 2 options: You either use your turret as the focal point, and yourself as the one firing people in the back, but this has 2 issues:    People get a lot more suspicious of this. You have lock-on times only limited by your reflexes, but your turret has a set delay. This means that some stronger weapons can ruin your crossfire before your turret fires a single shot because it is an easier target than you.   The other option, using yourself as the vocal point, has of course the more obvious drawback of having a higher chance of your lethality, but you, even though having the same health as your turret, are much harder to hit and can return fire instantly. If the enemy enters the crossfire, they are done for.  Once you understand this principle, you can truly understand the mind games. First of all, once people kill an isolated Bushwacker, they assume his turret is already done for, because thats how most people use it. So if you are at the objective, this is almost guaranteed to punish anyone rushing the objective after you.  Second of all, prioritization issues. Once they pick you as their main target, some juking can really screw up somebodies prioritization. They often let the turret take them because they are too focussed killing you.   So using this tactic is more likely to help you wrap up objectives, more likely to fool enemies and all by all you derive pleasure from screwing with your enemies. Its just all about not putting the turret next to you or as a single entity. You and the turret are a team and are supposed to work in tandem at every step, even if you die for it, because you might get objectives you usually don't get with this tactic."
Dirtybomb,3d4kp6,LatrodectusVS,2,Mon Jul 13 20:03:15 2015 UTC,"Interesting, the only problem I see is that I've learned (the hard way) not to chase after Bushwhackers, because I know they are trying to bait me into a trap. I feel like once people get super accustomed to turrets, they won't pose too big a threat, unless people get lazy (like forgetting to check for mines).  I guess the next thing is to set the turret up so that your team members are the bait, while you cover them from yet another direction.  Or start doing multibushwhacker turret backup crossfires, haha."
Dirtybomb,3d4kp6,PowerReef,3,Mon Jul 13 20:56:21 2015 UTC,"Another tip I'd like to throw out there concerning Fletcher:  If you're using sticky bombs as a trap around a corner, pressing the detonate key might not be quick enough to catch faster mercs like Proxy or Aura.  To make them detonate instantly, simply shoot them with your gun, and no merc will be capable of outrunning the blast."
Dirtybomb,3d4kp6,Maffis,2,Mon Jul 13 16:21:24 2015 UTC,"I had tried this, but found it difficult to consistently hit them...but that was with secondaries.

Dirtybomb,3d4kp6,p4v07,6,Mon Jul 13 17:47:04 2015 UTC,"It's the same with proxy. Drop a mine in a group, use your shotgun to guarantee it blows and boom, you get a quad kill that no one expects out of a proxy.  It's beautiful."

Dirtybomb,3d4kp6,Fire42uck,3,Mon Jul 13 15:58:53 2015 UTC,"I've read about people binding M2 to Quick Ability 2 instead so you can detonate with right-click. So now I have my thumb-mouse button for QB1 which means I can aim around while priming a sticky then instantly click M2 to detonate without ever letting go of the mouse or my strafe keys. I find that this way helped me alot and I constantly top-score as him now.  Only problem is that you can't bind M2 to your ADS/Alternate fire, so no Vassiling or Rhinoing around if you want this way to play.  I hope that in the future they make it so that we can make CFG's for every merc's keybindings.  EDIT: I just tried to have QB2 on Mouse3 instead and it actually works pretty well for me. Now I can use ADS/Alternate fire on my M2 again."
Dirtybomb,3d4kp6,bucier,3,Mon Jul 13 15:15:48 2015 UTC,"Simple question:  H22 - Hollund, Tolen MP (Enigma, Focus, Drilled)?  or  A31 - Ahnuhld, Empire 9 (Lock On, Tough, Double Time)?"
Dirtybomb,3d4kp6,wwilly,2,Mon Jul 13 20:08:47 2015 UTC,"A31, easily. Double Time alone makes that loadout superior. Running around and flanking with shotgun and stickies is deadly. Also, the Empire-9 is more accurate and has a bigger magazine than the Tolen. Hollunds is more forgiving than Ahnuld, but Ahnuld has better range and accuracy but less spread. If you manage to hit a headshot with the Ahnuld, the kill potential is far better than the Hollunds, especially at greater distances.  There is a loadout with Hollunds and a revolver that has Double Time and Unshakable. It's a good loadout for people with good aim, since the Revolver can deal alot of damage quickly at range, especially handy when finishing people of after taking a stickybomb. Unshakable is also a very good perk that both protects you from splash and your own stickies."
Dirtybomb,3d4kp6,INI_Fourzero,3,Mon Jul 13 20:45:17 2015 UTC,"Not arguing with you, but I still don't understand the benefit of double time. I pretty much never feel the need to reload while running, so I don't understand why the majority of players like it so much.  Again, not saying everyone else is wrong, and I'm right, just that I don't understand."
Dirtybomb,3d4kp6,omniblue,3,Mon Jul 13 21:00:10 2015 UTC,"It's because of the Ahnuld. Shotguns are slow to reload. It offers you a way to keep running around flanks while popping in to shoot and retreat while reloading. It's definitely not mandatory, like most perks. But it fits my run and gun-type of play very nice."
Dirtybomb,3d4kp6,drskyed,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:23:10 2015 UTC,"Gotcha. I use the iron version of this loadout, haven't managed to get a bronze one. Might just save up and buy it."
Dirtybomb,3d4kp6,INI_Fourzero,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:06:51 2015 UTC,"Simple answer, I like A31 the most because of the Empire 9 for usefulness, and Ahnuhld for style...  But it's not the best loadout, because it doesn't have quick draw, which is important for switching weapons. The problem with Fletcher is that all his good loadouts have something pretty shitty about them. I'm not sure how useful Drilled in H22 is on Fletcher since your main priority is worrying about the sticky bomb cooldown.  Anyway, the loadouts with quick draw are probably better, A62 and BL33. The problem is, they are both kinda shitty weapon wise.   A62 you get quick draw, but that's about it. You could argue that sneaky and the stiletto would be good in CQB (especially with stickies), but the problem is you will only be able to switch to the Ahnuhld, or the Simeon. Both of which are terrible at anything outside medium range.  BL33 gives you quick draw and tough which are good, but flying pig is broken, and it sticks you with the Blishlok. However, you do get the empire-9. BL33 is probably the better choice, since it is more well rounded.  TL;DR: Any loadout with the Empire 9, and/or quick draw, which ever is more important to you."

There is a few years of very custom code in there and porting that to UE4 would be not worth the effort.

They want to find the sweet spot between being able to get the average user to buy a few mercs but also able to spend ingame currency to unlock every thing else.   I like DB, but I don't like the recent trend in gaming for releasing games like they did. Beta should be limited. When a game is open to the public, it should be at full release. This prevents bad images of the game and overall is better for the game in the long term.

I was simply saying that the current meta is that one or two of the 9 load outs is generally considered ""the best"" in terms of weapons and perks and the rest are pointless in comparison. Things like how one of Vassili's Fel-ix is considered strictly worse than his MOA (or is it the other way around?) or perks like chopper which until recently allowed any merc with the stillnotto to one shot melee as well as Phantom's katana do make a difference when utilized correctly."

The only expensive thing are the mercs, really, but given the free rotation and the fact that all players start with Skyhammer (and Aura, but Skyhammer is very powerful), and quickly get enough cash cash to buy a third merc, I don't think the high cost is an issue at all."
Dirtybomb,3d8x55,fluency,2,Tue Jul 14 22:19:03 2015 UTC,Highly recommed giving this video a watch. It's made by a guy named LCTR and he explains everything you can and can't do with money in this game. He even gives you the best method on gaining the in-game credits.
Dirtybomb,3d8x55,DOGpls,2,Tue Jul 14 16:15:09 2015 UTC,"No, it is not p2w, but it is also not f2p. Its more like grind to play and pay for convenience."
Dirtybomb,3d8x55,Wimperator,2,Tue Jul 14 13:45:54 2015 UTC,Same thing for most games with microtransactions.
Dirtybomb,3d8x55,enilyxx,1 point,Tue Jul 14 12:57:08 2015 UTC,And both are only the second best options. :( Pay to not be annoyed is not a great way to make your players spend money.
Dirtybomb,3d8x55,PapstJL4U,0,Tue Jul 14 13:03:14 2015 UTC,"The grind isn't even that bad. You can get enough credits for a MERC in less than a week or so. And even the basic loadout cards are good.  Loadout cards gives you minor stat bonuses that most of the times go unnoticed (with the exception of a few, like Chopper), a skilled FPS player with the basic card will beat a new player using Cobalt cards."
Dirtybomb,3d8x55,Patriot_Brother,2,Tue Jul 14 13:43:05 2015 UTC,No.  For a total of 67.500 in game credits you can buy your desired merc and the best load out card for it.  In their beginning you get someone free cash if I remember correctly and 67.500 is easy to reach.  After this with some efficient play around your missions you can afford the next merc with the best load out card for it in about 10 days (may be more or less depending on how much you play).  The mentioned load out cards are in bronze which is the highest it can be perk wise. Everything else is cosmetics.   I would like to see some documentation (preferably links) regarding your statement that progress in this game is RNG.
Dirtybomb,3d8x55,Gulrotsaft,0,Tue Jul 14 14:18:47 2015 UTC,"So bronze is the highest effective level, and anything higher is just cosmetics?  If so then I can completely change my opinion."
Dirtybomb,3d8x55,TwoThreeSkidoo,5,Tue Jul 14 12:54:45 2015 UTC,"This is gonna sound shitty, but why did you make this post if you don't understand the loadout system? It even says in game that silver and up cards just add cosmetic changes."
Dirtybomb,3d8x55,TwoThreeSkidoo,-1,Tue Jul 14 12:56:39 2015 UTC,"It is a question a new player would have.  I somehow evaded the light small text that describes how loadouts work.  As well as my friends who have double the hours of me and this thread actually informed them.  However, the rng progression is still something that will offset a huge amount of people, especially critics like myself or Angry Joe who even has a whole video on it."
Dirtybomb,3d8x55,Hutchythesmall,3,Tue Jul 14 13:52:43 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but it's information that could have easily been found by reading forums, reviews, or just looking at the store in game. And what RNG progression, you can just buy the loadout you want for credits?  Also, agry joe doesn't seem like the brightest crayon in the box.  And yeah, the text is small, but it's still there. Does it need html blink tags and flashing arrows?"
Dirtybomb,3d8x55,Hutchythesmall,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:00:14 2015 UTC,Yeah. Every level above bronze is the exact same except with different skins.
Dirtybomb,3d8x55,Gulrotsaft,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:12:42 2015 UTC,"Gotcha.  Well that solves that.  I'm actually trying to do a comprehensive review on the game, and it being free to play I need to always go into detail about the monetization.  It kind of confused me but now it is clear.  Thanks."
Dirtybomb,3d8x55,Hutchythesmall,2,Tue Jul 14 13:00:40 2015 UTC,No bother. It's also worth noting that bronze+ loadouts sometimes have a pretty useless third perk (ex. Cool) so in some situations they're basically equal to iron ones
Dirtybomb,3d8x55,BansheeBomb,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:08:24 2015 UTC,Yes indeed.  On top of this the offered perks doesn't give you too much advantage.
Dirtybomb,3d8x55,BangFoyoBuck,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:30:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I play with iron cards sometimes because the bronze ones usually have a useless perk (I'm looking at you, Cool) and I'm saving my credits for mercs rather than loadouts"
Dirtybomb,3d8x55,BansheeBomb,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:09:58 2015 UTC,Somewhat. You can buy mercs which gives you more options than f2p players and then you can buy the best bronze loadouts for those mercs which gives you more perks than the f2p players who might have something below bronze or a loadout that they don't want.  It's not a very significant advantage but it does exist which makes the game pay 2 win.
Dirtybomb,3d8x55,BangFoyoBuck,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:33:56 2015 UTC,"What? The f2p players can buy them too. They just have to grind for a bit. The only advantage people who pay for the game have, is being able to unlock mercs earlier. Thats not pay 2 win, thats just pay 2 skip. And people who play the game will get enough credits eventually anyway. The point of the game is to play, not to earn credits. You can have fun without having the best loadout card."
Dirtybomb,3d8x55,BansheeBomb,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:25:05 2015 UTC,Well there's a delay before the f2p player can get the things he wants and during that delay he has to use sub-par loadouts and he doesn't have the choice of mercs that the p2p has. During this delay the p2p player is at an advantage hence he paid to win.
Dirtybomb,3d8x55,BangFoyoBuck,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:47:55 2015 UTC,"That ""advantage"" is 3 perks that hardly changes the way you play or perform, and weapons (Anyone with some experience in fps games can wreck house with the starter weapons).   I don't really think the differences between loadouts are big enough to claim that the game is p2w (Not even somewhat, tbh)."
Dirtybomb,3d8x55,BansheeBomb,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:38:06 2015 UTC,"I never said that it was a huge advantage, but it does mean that someone who pays can gain an advantage over someone who doesn't, which is pay 2 win."
Dirtybomb,3d8x55,BangFoyoBuck,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:16:37 2015 UTC,"Isn't the definition of pay 2 win, being able to pay real money for an in-game advantage, that somehow makes the game unbalanced in the favor of the one who pays? I've yet to see a loadout that is so powerful, that it makes the game easier against noobs."
Dirtybomb,3d8x55,BansheeBomb,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:24:48 2015 UTC,"Right, and the delay I was talking about gives an advantage to the one who pays, hence it is pay 2 win."
Dirtybomb,3d8x55,BangFoyoBuck,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:33:48 2015 UTC,"But not a big enough advantage to make the game unbalanced; hence, it is not pay 2 win."

Dirtybomb,3d8x55,Hutchythesmall,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:57:33 2015 UTC,it's f2p game with a pretty solid bussiness model where you can get shiny/cosmetics items and credit/xp boosts for some real money.  But as a person that wont spend any money you wont be in any disadvantage over any other person
Dirtybomb,3d8x55,lispychicken,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:13:26 2015 UTC,"I still consider League of Legends P2W because of their champion buying system and how long it takes a f2p to unlock them.  I used to consider this game P2W for the same reason, but my opinion on that is changing because it doesn't take as long to unlock mercs the f2p way as I thought it did. Seems pretty fair to me."

The worst part for me is how none of the trailers focus on the skill-based, fast-paced nature of this game. It's always slow and obviously staged kills against dummies. I think this game could really use something that showcases the actual nature of this game, maybe even with player comms, like the This is EVE Trailer for EVE Online or the PS4 Trailer for Planetside 2. They're obviously also a bit misleading, but they might do a better job of communicating what this game is about and how it plays."

Dirtybomb,3d3wbo,dejecaal,16,Mon Jul 13 18:37:43 2015 UTC,"Dude you made me read so much and most of it is just about the issues that has been discussed here and elsewhere so much and for most of them we know that solutions are being worked on (hackers - new anti cheat is pending, broken MM - will be fixed, private servers - they said we will be able to create our own map instances). You should follow dev streams on twitch (Mondays and Wednesdays) if you don't already.       Let me talk about actual constructive suggestions you offered.     First of all Dirty Bomb is FPS game. Very old school. It's not an RPG. You don't advance (earn XP) to make your character stronger or have more perks. FPS games are not about who is able to pick better combination of weapons and perks, it's about physical skills, and only about that.      Loadout system is in concept very fair and very balanced for an FPS game. It offers you to pick what works for your play style the best - a combination of better perks OR better weapons. Its actual implementation is not the best, but devs have announced that the next thing they will be working on is Loadout cards v2, so I expect better balance in the future. RNG on loadout cards is something that you can and should ignore and just go for the cards that work for you and buy them from the store. Everyone is whining about how in the beginning they don't have the same augmentations as other players, but somehow forget that within the first 3 hours of play you earn more than 30k of credits that, if you are smart enough, you can use to purchase 2 bronze cards of your choice and max out 2 of your mercs before you reach lvl5. That's your first day in game! In what other game you can do that? You suggest that we should be able to pick weapons and augments that we want, but that would make this game into something completely other than it already is. That would actually push it too far to MOBA side, the balance of it would be insane, because in MOBAs (that are RPG games basically) the winner is the player who is able to manage the characters, weapons and abilities AND of course the one with better skills and reaction times. FPS games, historically, are about physical skill and twitch gameplay. Character management should be secondary and rudimentary. I don't say you suggestion is bad, MOBAs are interesting, it's a good concept, but you can't expect from the game that is so heavily entranched within FPS, historically and otherwise (take a look at Splash Damage history) to go and break that concept in favor of MOBA games. Also it's far too late to make such a big change, it would push development way back, a year, maybe more. SD is very small studio, it's not Valve, or BIizzard. And what's most important it would be impossible to balance and keep even playfield.  As for the skins and silly things you suggest, please NO. Let's not make this game another TF2. Let's have one game that will stay decent and old school (enough) for the people that are actually serious about their gaming. I mean, skins are fine, but let's not go over the top please?     The last thing I don't understand is why the hell would you pay for XP boost? You don't get anything with XP, as I said, this is not RPG game. At least now you know it's an actual measurement how good the player really is (if you compare it with hours spent in game)."
Dirtybomb,3d3wbo,BearPawsOG,5,Mon Jul 13 11:39:24 2015 UTC,"History has thought us that every game that tries to go ""old school"" (i'd call it niche) ends up with a very small hardcore community. This can be fine if a game is flat out free or in some cases can work for a b2p game. But f2p games have to attract a very large variety of gamers because a VERY small percentage of f2p players actually invest money in the game. And hardcore players are not one of those, especially if they can grind it out."

So the entirety of the TF2 gamer community are casuals and not serious about their game?  And skins don't harm anyone in any way whatsoever. The game already applies a reddish/bluish tint in addition to friendly doritos so there won't be any issues of recognition. It's a smart way to generate extra revenue without having to resolve to inflating merc stats to cash in on early birds and then nerfing them."

See, TF2 and Overwatch will be like that, isn't it better for DB to make a difference and somehow stay on the market? Splash Damage is a far smaller than Valve or Blizzard it will take a miracle to survive in that kind of competition, do you really want DB to be so similar to competitive products? This way we actually have something that has it's firm place on the market: game that's looks serious, competitive by design, supported by pros and competitive community.

No objections here.  But I don't see how skins in any way remove ""seriousness"". Besides, there's no reason implementing paid skins = santa claus rhinos and legolas phantoms. Skins don't need to be inherently silly. It's a design choice and judging by SD's design language I'd be surprised if they'd implement shitty silliness. It'd just look fucking stupid.  It's different enough as it is so I'm not worried about losing the player base to either TF2 nor to Overwatch. Besides, skins help the game stay fresh.

Dirtybomb,3d3wbo,pisshead_,-1,Mon Jul 13 18:17:34 2015 UTC,"I'll ignore that Ad Hominem attack and get to the important part: CS, like any other FPS is about twitch play and physical skill. Player that's more skilful than you will kill you even with a weapon that's not as good as yours. Economy and loadouts management do not have any more impact than DB loadouts have (even though it's not the same thing at all). In RPGs though, the way you built your character is of crucial importance: it's level, skills, items determine who will be the winner. I just don't think that FPS game should have those elements and still be called FPS."

I'm in the same boat as you with the Alienware cases, I got crappy loadouts that I'm never gonna use... What exactly is the point then ? At the very least skins should be separated from perks. And ideally building your own card (Skin + weapon choice + perks) would be the best.  Custom servers too would solve a lot of problems. People don't like Phantom and aim punch ? Boom, they can rent a server, forbid Phantom on it and reduce aim punch ! If we can ever have rented servers, they should be as customizable as possible. It will let people who don't enjoy a part of the game still enjoy it !  I've personally built up a lot of frustration these days and won't be playing the game for at least a week.   I've been unlucky and everytime I joined a match my team was outnumbered because of ghosted servers. The Alienware cases I can't use because the loadouts are crappy. The change to the aim punch. I have 250 hours in the game and was starting to get good at aiming. Frankly I don't know if the change they made is good or not but I'm struggling to have a KDR > 1 after 250 hours of gameplay.

Dirtybomb,3d3wbo,PapstJL4U,0,Mon Jul 13 09:39:57 2015 UTC,"@servers, hackers, service problems, lags etc: not much to add. The solution is pretty easy. Don't have them.  A harder question would probably be monetization and gameplay. To go against the percieved and sometimes felt pay4power aspect, i would give every player every bronze loadout in lead form. Every player has every loadout variation. This allows SD to go crazy with balance, because they don't fuck over paying customers. Stopping people from netdecking with rng and money is not a good idea in my mind.  They should seperate all weapon skins from each other and  the loadouts. This allows for more customization. Something like this  Mercs   Kira...  Arty...  Aura   Remburg skin  Hollund skin  Blishlok sKin  ...  Stiletto skin  Cricket Bat skin   Proxy   Hollund skin  ...  EV graffiti skin   ...   This allows for maximum customization and good profit, because players will probably buy 4 different skins per weapon for the merc."

Dirtybomb,3d5r98,AlbinoBunny,4,Mon Jul 13 21:01:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah, my feelings on FPS stealth mechanics are pretty well documented at this point (they're dumb, frustrating to play against and need to be handled really well to work, which SD hasn't done) but even disregarding that this sounds like a bad idea because ultimately if you're safe to plant you don't need the grenade and if you're not safe to plant you'll die right after and the defuse will happen anyway.  It'd pretty much be a more extreme version of proxy back caps but without even the ability to defend your suicide plant to slow down and pull enemies out of position."
Dirtybomb,3d5r98,damiksoni,2,Mon Jul 13 20:11:18 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty well documented at this point too, and I do agree with you. I think that overall, stealth mechanics need to be flexible systems. The 'press LMB to kill, press e to become invisible' is too linear for a game about capping objectives in large open spaces, and tight corners. Tribes, for instance worked around it with the Jammers and jammer packs.  I definitively think there's something to do about that special mechanic they added, which wouldn't doesn't scream for counter-merc. There's a way to work around it and to build it correctly.   I've gotten plenty of ideas, but this one seemed like a good one. Something as stupid as 'can't use weapons when stealth'/during uncloaking, or 'not invisible, but un-detectable' could be quite good  I could see a merc that has two silenced pistols, a hammer as melee weapon, and bypass detection completly. That would be another kind of 'invisible'"

So to keep the same sens I had while upping the in-game sens I lowered my dpi from 800 to 400 and increased hipfire sens from 4.4 to 9 since it was apparently better to have a round number sens than decimal values.

Dirtybomb,3d23i7,Nantei,-42,Mon Jul 13 04:57:22 2015 UTC,"So I see math isn't your strong suit. Let's do some quick and dirty math.  20% of 90 is 18, added together is 108 damage. Barely enough to one-shot a vassi, but not enough to make a difference in killing anyone else. Smart perk choice? If you are really dedicated to one-shotting one more merc and are adverse to using your far superior smg. Chopper is super overvalued on a merc that shouldn't even be using his melee weapon for anything but one-shotting anyways. This gif perfectly illustrates the idiocy involved in rushing towards people to stab them in the face, and you people still complain about morons that are basically gift wrapping kills for you."

It's a choice between a better SMG and being able to one-shot one more merc. Not a particularly hard choice if you ask me."
Dirtybomb,3d23i7,Alphadef,12,Sun Jul 12 23:19:29 2015 UTC,"From what I understand the kek is the go to smg, which has a load out with increased cloak time. The katana, and CHOPPER. There's little reason not to have it."

Dirtybomb,3d23i7,Hutchythesmall,7,Sun Jul 12 23:36:21 2015 UTC,"I said that the player using the most melee orientated character in the game would be smart to use a perk which increases melee damage  What's the 66% chance to be wrong coming from and why get so hostile? I simply said that it'd be the smart way to go. Especially the C94 which gives you the kek (Considered better usually because of the forgiving fire rate and really low recoil even though Crotzni is lower TTK on paper), it boosts your invisibility, increases melee damage and then reduces MG cool down(OK, that one's useless)"
Dirtybomb,3d23i7,Nantei,-6,Sun Jul 12 23:47:36 2015 UTC,"You said nothing of the sort. You implied it would be smart in general to use it, when the perk makes very little difference since it lets you one-shot a merc that you probably shouldn't be threatened by anyways. And the recoil differences are pretty minor, the Crotzni doesn't have much kick at all unlike the Timik, which is why most tourney players go for it. (I can totally understand that argument with a Timik vs M4 argument, though.) If I was worried about recoil and fire rate, I would probably just get the blishlok, which IIRC is slightly better than the Kek as well, but I obviously can't confirm that right now. The Crotzni loadout has the 20% increase as well, which is sort of the one that matters, as well as two other perks that are... okay, at least more useful than cool. The 66% measure comes from the fact that there's only one loadout with the katana that has chopper, out of the three katana loadouts. Most weapon choices apart from Kira/Arty's selection are preferential to a point, but there are certain weapons that are just outright better."
Dirtybomb,3d23i7,RobReynalds,2,Sun Jul 12 23:56:04 2015 UTC,Lmao.. Crotzni over kek? Theoretical ttk is not relevent. Kek is the clear winner in actual play.
Dirtybomb,3d23i7,Nantei,-7,Mon Jul 13 04:03:10 2015 UTC,"If you can't handle the recoil on the Crot then CSGO and PS2 must be unplayable to you. The hipfire recoil on guns in this game it's pathetically low. The accuracy of the two is practically identical. Oh, and speaking of 'actual play', most pros prefer the crotz and timik respectively."
Dirtybomb,3d23i7,Alphadef,-1,Mon Jul 13 04:20:28 2015 UTC,Fair enough. You may be correct I'm just going by what I've heard.
Dirtybomb,3d23i7,Hutchythesmall,4,Sun Jul 12 23:40:16 2015 UTC,"The Crotzni has better damage but the kek is often preferred due to the fire rate, accuracy and very (very) very low recoil. It's mostly personal preference though as to which one to pick - I like the kek on my Bushwhacker but when I go Nader I find the Crotzni decent as well"
Dirtybomb,3d23i7,Nantei,-3,Mon Jul 13 00:13:39 2015 UTC,"I'm not actually sure where that sentiment initially spawned from. But you can compare it on Pixel's sheet once he gets it working again. I am guessing someone goofed with the formulas. It's like the M4 versus the Timik. The M4 is overall worse than the Timik, but not by a massive margin. https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/t1KG1mkIajGcBuDFQ6MTKlw/htmlview#"
Dirtybomb,3d23i7,qdatk,7,Sun Jul 12 23:41:45 2015 UTC,"You mean the move that wouldn't have killed Vassili? Yeah, thank god he forgot.   ""He can't get a one-hit kill but has to click twice. Therefore not OP!""  Imagine that, having to remember to click twice. I barely remember what I had for breakfast."
Dirtybomb,3d23i7,Nantei,-5,Mon Jul 13 00:32:56 2015 UTC,Which has a significantly higher ttk than just shooting them. Math is hard.
Dirtybomb,3d23i7,qdatk,8,Mon Jul 13 01:57:11 2015 UTC,Are you being deliberately thick? The game is not decided by comparing ttk numbers. Shooting requires aim. Slashing around with a katana when your cloak got you within two feet does not.
Dirtybomb,3d23i7,Nantei,-14,Mon Jul 13 02:18:35 2015 UTC,Right. This is the difference between us. I see some idiot rush me down with a sword and I blow his head off. You pull for your knife because you apparently struggle to hit targets at two feet. Maybe you should try a console shooter.
Dirtybomb,3d23i7,qdatk,5,Mon Jul 13 04:23:21 2015 UTC,"Good god, you can't even keep your own arguments straight. You were talking about the Phantom's weapons, whether the katana or the SMG is better. Now you are talking about shooting a Phantom. FYI, the Phantom's shield will tank him through anything a sniper can throw at him until he gets into range for two swipes.  Try thinking more and insulting less."
Dirtybomb,3d23i7,Nantei,-11,Mon Jul 13 04:37:10 2015 UTC,"Speaking of getting our arguments straight, have you tried reading comprehension? I've already talked about how pathetically easy it is to hit your target at that point, the ttk is objectively lower unless your accuracy is literally below 50%, and anyone who is even remotely good can gun you down during that. Maybe you should run some numbers, get good, and stop bitching about mercs that are obscenely easy to counter. All you've done this entire thread is move your goal posts as your list of excuses grows. This entire thread you've been moving goal posts and just surmounting excuses while you ignore obvious evidence that puts Phantom below the curve."
Dirtybomb,3d23i7,qdatk,7,Mon Jul 13 04:48:21 2015 UTC,"Yes, I'm the unreasonable one. I'm the one who is using the example of someone getting lucky against an out-manoeuvred Phantom as evidence that he's ""obscenely easy to counter."" I'm the one who has decided that raw TTK numbers are at all relevant in a tactical situation where one side is invisible.  You want to talk about TTK? Let's talk about the TTK starting from after the Phantom has already taken one swipe at you. Because, guess what, that's when the engagement starts as far as the non-Phantom is concerned.  BTW, I'm not ""bitching."" I just think you're so invested in defending Phantom that you're trying to justify indefensible positions. And you have no manners."
Dirtybomb,3d23i7,Sardonislamir,5,Mon Jul 13 05:14:04 2015 UTC,"Yup, people forget he is basically any other fast melee with a one melee hit lead on a player. The only chance you have vs phantom is seeing him past fifty feet. Not even my rhino with a perfect tracking and pre-spun up minigun will win if phantom is only spotted just cloaking under that 30ft-40ft as it is always a double KO. Phantoms that utilize long jump clear that distance very fast."
Dirtybomb,3d23i7,Nantei,-3,Mon Jul 13 06:13:26 2015 UTC,"So he starts at an advantage because he snuck up on you? The guy who is easy to see and has an incredibly distinct high c noise following him around? Hate to break it to you, but that's your fault. Also you might want to Google the definition of invisible. Your understanding of the word is shakey at best."
Dirtybomb,3d23i7,Sardonislamir,3,Mon Jul 13 07:18:47 2015 UTC,"You have never played Dust 514 on PS3 have you? Super balanced stealth vs tank design. Both played well stomps the other. Tanks hold ground and stealth capture. Stealth takes 3-4 bullets or 1 shotgun or knife, and tank eats 25-50 bullets, 4-6 shotgun(direct all pellet hits), or 2-3 knives(1.5 second charge ups each).  Now with that said, tracking a jumping target practically clipping through you is really really hard, because their is no landing animation that includes mass, they can skip to jumping like a cricket instantly. At point blank vs lightsaber melee, your not having a good time as your weapon ttk is 3-4 seconds vs a ttk of 2."

It also feels good when you see them charging your aura cloaked and you just 180 sprint walljump away and unload the Blishok before they have time to react or fully change to the SMG.  Beautiful.

Gunned him down in that same area later on after catching him in the corner of my screen and he stopped doing that.  Defending in a corner, gunning down phantoms trying to rush me? Check.  Popping out of that corner and gunning down phantoms trying to rush my ghost? Check.  Sitting outside of that corner and winning shootouts with those phantoms? Check.  Honestly, just get good. The classes that are squishy for him can outrun him (protip: when they leap they're calling their shot, don't move in one direction away from them), the class that is borderline is a direct counter to him in more ways than one, and everyone else can just kill him outright in a fight. Oh yeah, and every class can leap, if you see one coming for you and you can't kill him for whatever reason (need to reload), leap towards your teammates. His biggest advantage is the lack of distance between you and him, so keep the distance."

Dirtybomb,3d61or,LLAMATARIANISM,2,Mon Jul 13 21:47:03 2015 UTC,So you could be playing bad or good and still be getting the same amount of credits? Or do you get less if you're doing really bad or afk? Also is xp a factor or not?
Dirtybomb,3d61or,diamondwing,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:56:05 2015 UTC,"after a game, you receive base fee and additional credits based on how well you did (i.e. xp from medals). that way, even if you're terrible, you still get some credits."

Dirtybomb,3d51f8,drunkpunk138,2,Mon Jul 13 17:02:00 2015 UTC,Buying cases is a really bad idea anyway. You earn lots from just playing and then you can trade up low tier ones for a decent iron one for a specific merc.

Dirtybomb,3d76ud,Stuhlgewitter,2,Tue Jul 14 01:36:40 2015 UTC,I've ran into a few lately....Dat armor is all I have to say...  Phantom must be the head dev or CEO's favorite character cause no way in hell he should of been released as he is now.
Dirtybomb,3d76ud,NamelessLiberty,4,Tue Jul 14 02:09:35 2015 UTC,"If you followed the devs you would know why he got released in its current state, and why now.  To be honest, the more I play the less I think he is OP. Unbalanced? Sure. But he is nowhere near as broken as prople say it is."
Dirtybomb,3d76ud,Patriot_Brother,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:14:02 2015 UTC,"I agree. When he was first released I had the same knee jerk reaction as everyone else. But he seemed way more OP than he actually is at that time, because he plays completely counterintuitive to the way players had been fighting other Mercs. Now that people have adapted to him and learned how to fight him, I'd say he's a bit overtuned but far from OP. I just picked him, and have to say he's alot of fun, though his shield is kind of nuts. I personally would like to see his stealth shield reduced or removed, and his speed increased instead."
Dirtybomb,3d76ud,Wraithial,1 point,Tue Jul 14 05:29:43 2015 UTC,Shhh you're ruining the circlejerk.  Phantom reminds me a lot of Rhino. He decimates pubs but has very situational uses against higher skilled opponents. Phantom's stealth aspects aren't great against a team that's communicating and knows the auditory and visual cues. Add a well placed heartbeat sensor or two and I'd say he's not worth running over Fragger.
Dirtybomb,3d76ud,BillNyeTheScience,2,Tue Jul 14 07:39:22 2015 UTC,"He's the narrator and ""star"" of one of the fanciest trailers, and his characterization is an insufferably smug Mary Sue. So, yes. You are almost certainly correct."
Dirtybomb,3d76ud,TroubleEntendre,2,Tue Jul 14 02:23:38 2015 UTC,"I've been thinking, maybe one of the biggest issues with phantom is his health to speed. Most mercs that are fast usually sit around with 90 health where as phantom has 120, so a way to balance would be to decrease his base health down to 90 or 100 and increase the cooldown on his stealth."
Dirtybomb,3d76ud,scwala,1 point,Tue Jul 14 08:21:08 2015 UTC,"playing today i learned if you listen carefully, phantoms cloak makes a high pitched whistling sound while it is active. its about as loud as footsteps are."

Dirtybomb,3d76ud,7supersonicfan,-4,Tue Jul 14 08:13:53 2015 UTC,"I have two words of advice for you, my friend.  get  good  Phantom is a fucking garbage dumpster tier merc. Playing melee only Phantom takes no skill, yeah, but it also only works against players with no skill.  Using your gun is more effective, yes, but it also takes skill, and if you have the skill to shoot the gun you could be playing literally any other gun merc in the game and be more effective.  Phantom's invisibility is an useless gimmick that only works properly in two situations: against shit players, and when you're standing completely still. Thing is, against shit players you could be playing a pistol only Proxy and kick ass, and while standing completely still you're not, you know, moving anywhere and thus you're generally useless.  Fucking Sawbonez is a billion times better gun merc than Phantom. You get a pretty much equally good gun, ~INFINITE HEALTH~, and on top of that you can be credit to your shitter team by reviving their retarded dead arses every now and then.  And don't even get me started on the actual fragging gun mercs like Fragger or Vassili that Phantom is competing in the same class with.  So yeah. Git gud. Here's a hint: the first step to getting good is to quit whining about every little fucking thing and learning how to deal with it.  And in case you're wondering, here's how you deal with Phantom: You shoot him in the face until he dies. He's just a retard bringing a knife to a gunfight, thinking he's invisible while he's not. Shoot him while he's running towards you like a moron and put him to the ground. Or if he whips out his gun, then just deal with him like you would with any other merc by shooting them in the face more than they shoot you in the face. Super simple stuff."
Dirtybomb,3d76ud,dejecaal,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:08:46 2015 UTC,"This can all be summarized with your last point: Shoot him.   Problem is, he tanks as much as a Rhino with his cloak and can take a close range shotgun shot without dying. And by the time you try to shoot him again, guess what? He just ran up to your face and oneshot you. I see so many people arguing about how easy it is to just ""shoot him"". If it were that easy, I don't think he'd consistently top scoreboards."
Dirtybomb,3d76ud,AMasonJar,2,Tue Jul 14 05:26:29 2015 UTC,He can take two shotgun shots from the most powerful shotgun at point blank range. He dies on the third.
Dirtybomb,3d76ud,Hornfreak,1 point,Tue Jul 14 07:09:49 2015 UTC,"At point blank range, you'd be dead to his katana."
Dirtybomb,3d76ud,AMasonJar,1 point,Tue Jul 14 07:14:40 2015 UTC,Exactly. I usually play proxy but lately I've mostly played Rhino because he is really the best merc to deal with him.
Dirtybomb,3d76ud,Hornfreak,1 point,Tue Jul 14 07:15:51 2015 UTC,"His cloak can eat like 75 damage or something if he's just popped it and it's at full duration. Chances are by the time you're shooting at him it's already at half duration or less left, which means that it's going to deplete completely in a couple of hits. After that he's just a 120hp chump who wasn't prepared to being engaged yet, so you'll actually have the upper hand.   by the time you try to shoot him again, guess what? He just ran up to your face and oneshot you.   If this actually consistently happens to you with Phantoms you need to improve your aim or get better at spotting them, or both. Shotgun mercs like Proxy can literally just backpedal and Phantom won't be able to catch up to them.   If it were that easy, I don't think he'd consistently top scoreboards.    Phantom is easy as fuck to play, and is effective against awful players. That's why you see so many of them topping the scoreboards. On top of that, melee kills award more score (through medals) than gun kills, which means that Phantoms need to do comparatively less to get more score.  A decent player can top the scoreboard and frags on shitty publics as any merc. Does this mean that every merc is OP?"
Dirtybomb,3d76ud,dejecaal,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:43:33 2015 UTC,"One issue with his cloak is there's no spillover damage. If you shoot him in the head point blank with a shotgun, and he has 1 point of cloak left, he decloaks and still has 120 health. And with how wonky melee is, backpedaling isn't usually an option because fast mercs will be dead anyways before they react. His cloak isn't very noticeable if you aren't actively looking, and often times you won't be because you're aiming somewhere else."
Dirtybomb,3d76ud,AMasonJar,0,Tue Jul 14 15:58:36 2015 UTC,"If they did what you just said to do, he'd be absolutely useless. A brain dead monkey would be able to kill him without using the mouse."

Dirtybomb,3d76ud,Hutchythesmall,1 point,Tue Jul 14 07:28:45 2015 UTC,Except he has incomplete invisibility. At that point why don't I just pick proxy and sneak behind them with a shotgun? Same results but I get to be useful with objectives to.

Dirtybomb,3d76ud,Alphadef,1 point,Tue Jul 14 07:54:12 2015 UTC,"Invisibility for sneaking behind and getting in a position to backstab.  I think he'd be fine if they just let the shield clock explosives, but break when shot."

Dirtybomb,3d5ehs,elintepic,5,Mon Jul 13 17:40:34 2015 UTC,"how to use it: hold q and aim at suitable location you want it to drop at and wait for the circle and fill, usually there's an audio cue when it successfully triggered (either you hear the mortar rounds coming down or one of arty's lines)  why it's not so great:   low overall damage in comparison to kira or skyhammer (rarely gibs players you manage to drop it on) rather small AoE (i've found kira's laser to have better AoE than it) and short lived just like kira's laser it can be extremely picky about where you can call it down on but least with kira you can channel it a bit away from where you wanted it and guide it home thanks to the above issue and the wonders of aimpunch getting shot at all will usually reset your channeling making it impossible to actually try to use it (kira IIRC suffers from this as well but usually she doesn't live long enough to realize it when it happens)   what i'd like to see done to arty's q:   make it behave like nader's grenade launcher or rhino's minigun (in the sense he has to switch to it to use it) remove the channeling time entirely (make it point and launch) and fix the issues with it not recognizing proper striking areas (why must i aim at the ground the EV is on to actually target it instead of just aiming at the EV to begin with?) up the blast radius to at least be obviously bigger than kira's laser and perhaps give arty a cap of 3 rounds to use instead of 2"

Dirtybomb,3d14t0,pockoman,46,Sun Jul 12 17:33:45 2015 UTC,Most of these seem pretty alright.  The fact that there's so little disagreement about what's the 'best' loadout kinda speaks volumes about how badly made the system is.  The fact that the best perks and best guns consistently come up on the same loadouts is really terrible.
Dirtybomb,3d14t0,AlbinoBunny,19,Sun Jul 12 18:14:26 2015 UTC,"Yep.  Moreover, while the game couldn't be considered ""pay to win"" right now, this is how pay to win starts: when ""alternative choices"" become ""necessary and objectively best choices.""   Most f2p games that offer in-game purchases either make said purchases purely cosmetic or stylistic alternatives that aren't inherently better than the default loadout. When the default, free loadout for each character becomes objectively worse than those which you could buy, well, things start to become a problem."
Dirtybomb,3d14t0,LOMAN-,12,Sun Jul 12 19:58:01 2015 UTC,"Nah, even if one of the nine loadouts is always best I don't think it's pay to win because you can still just go drop 17.5K if you wanna get super competitive with a character.  It's just kinda a shame that the system's clearly designed not to provide a range of options but instead to create frustration and the urge to buy more crates/craft far more."
Dirtybomb,3d14t0,AlbinoBunny,9,Sun Jul 12 20:26:44 2015 UTC,"TotalBiscuit referred to it as ""Pay 2 Skip"" and I don't really have much of a problem with that. The content (and power boosts) are not directly gated, but time gated. Time that would simply be spent playing the game.  I personally don't understand why you would do that -- pay money to not play the game -- but if you're really strapped for playtime, more power to ya. I suppose if you want to be competitive and have all the best stuff right off the bat, it makes sense. As for me personally, right around the time that I fully understood the maps, mercs, weapons and objectives, I had enough credits to purchase most of what I need/wanted.  I've been deliberately playing this game fully F2P to see whether it holds up to that standard, and so far, so good. I will certainly throw SD some coin for cosmetic loadouts at some point."
Dirtybomb,3d14t0,treycook,3,Sun Jul 12 22:58:04 2015 UTC,"That's true. But it means you HAVE to grind OR spend money. Meaning you can spend money and immediately have an OBJECTIVE ADVANTAGE over others. What this means is that new players who have not grinded out currency or spent money are at an objective statistical disadvantage to others who have played longer or paid money, which can be frustrating and dissuade them from continuing to play.   Of course, these games do want to make money (or reward grinding) and so that is usually remedied by a free rotation: new players get access to a small handful of characters that are equal to all others, and must pay or grind to unlock their favorites. This is not the case here."
Dirtybomb,3d14t0,LOMAN-,2,Sun Jul 12 20:34:18 2015 UTC,"Again with the grind. If you play super competitive (as /u/AlbinoBunny said) you are going to play A LOT, and credits will be there as a side effect. 17.5k of credits is 2 days of playing, if you are lazy. It's not like you played for 2 days just to get that amount so you can buy a card. You are playing anyway. Why is everyone keep forgetting that? ""This game makes you grind"" is such a stupid argument."
Dirtybomb,3d14t0,BearPawsOG,1 point,Mon Jul 13 01:32:49 2015 UTC,"You are missing my point. Grinding for alternative and additional content (like mercs) is completely fine. But the problem is when you have to grind for days for ""better"" content. To be put at a distinct disadvantage for days before you are finally on an even playing field is not good, because it means many new players will feel cheated and quit the game before giving it a fair shot."
Dirtybomb,3d14t0,LOMAN-,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:32:56 2015 UTC,"Differences between cards are definitely not a ""distinct"" disadvantage. Even if they were, every player that just started playing this game, after 3 hours of play has enough credits to buy ANY two bronze cards from the store. Isn't that good enough?"
Dirtybomb,3d14t0,BearPawsOG,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:51:10 2015 UTC,"The original point of this specific conversation is that it is becoming such that a single loadout is being perceived as objectively the best, and the conversation then transitioned into a hypothetical one about the potential future for the game if this precedent continues."
Dirtybomb,3d14t0,LOMAN-,2,Mon Jul 13 03:05:26 2015 UTC,"Yes, and a single loadout is 2-3 days away from anyone for free, I don't see how it's making it a P2W problem"
Dirtybomb,3d14t0,kalbuth,1 point,Mon Jul 13 08:20:21 2015 UTC,"Because perception matters.  All content in FFXIV is lovingly crafted and great fun to go through.  It doesn't mean getting Santasha 30 times in a row on duty finder doesn't make me hate that dungeon.   Same thing for situations where people log on and feel compelled to complete their missions even if they're tired/want to play another game. It's absolutely grinding.  Aint nothing wrong with grinding innately though, so lets not do that thing where people yell to the tree tops 'if you're not having fun just stop!' as if meta games in multiplayer video games haven't being designed specifically to increase player engagement without automatically increasing player enjoyment."
Dirtybomb,3d14t0,AlbinoBunny,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:59:23 2015 UTC,"I mean, I agree it's a shitty way to incentivise spending credits on things that the player otherwise wouldn't be interested in but it's just like League's rune system; there to make small content pools stretch further.   Also yes, before someone points it out I'm aware League no longer has a small content pool. I was talking from a launch perspective."
Dirtybomb,3d14t0,AlbinoBunny,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:43:16 2015 UTC,"Well that's true just from the tiered system, it has nothing whatsoever to do with how well the loadouts are designed. The default loadouts get no perks, and Bronze gets 3. That's objectively better in every case. And it's not a problem because A) the advantages are smallish and B) it's quite easy to get a Bronze loadout."

I can understand how A31 is attractive, but I am sorry, BL33 is a far better loadout than BL32. Fletcher relies a lot on weapon switching, so Quick Draw help you A LOT in every combat situation, and also gives you the Empire 9 as well. You won't need Fail Safe if you know what you are doing with your stickies, and Springy is not even that good. At least you can use Fail Safe for ""sticky jumping"", but don't hope it'll do miracles."
Dirtybomb,3d14t0,EarlTheOwl,1 point,Sun Jul 12 18:37:03 2015 UTC,"BL33 is better but unless they fix the blish it's pointless if you're going to be using the Empire most of the time anyway. I couldn't even notice the weapon-switch speed affecting stickies deployment+trigger to my great disappointment.  After spending 15k trading up and still not getting A31 I bought it with steam bux and was even more disappointed lock-on does nothing to the stickies.  My preferred loadout finally made Fletcher work for me.  Nobody seems to rate it, just has the best two guns with Hollunds 880 and Empire 9.  Perks are just perks, weapons are most important, and the extra firepower at short range is perfect for Phantoms face."
Dirtybomb,3d14t0,semi_modular_mind,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:09:02 2015 UTC,"The A31 is better than I expected, just got an iron version. I've found that using the emp9 as your primary, and switching to the ahnuld for finishers works very well (basically close distance and circle with the emp9, then finish with the ahnuld).  I really like the other loadout with the ahnuld, some other random mp, and unshakable and ...the arm icon. Makes him tanky. But the emp9 is so much nicer to use."

Dirtybomb,3d14t0,SC2_Bench,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:45:54 2015 UTC,you like R51 over R22? I love having looter and double time. Even Flying pig is useful on some maps. That loadout has served me well
Dirtybomb,3d14t0,SC2_Bench,7,Sun Jul 12 22:05:42 2015 UTC,"Flying Pig is actually bugged at the moment. It does nothing. This was recorded with R22, it's a known bug: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QN-NbQ_T11U  R22 is mostly a luxury loadout. Like none of the perks really increase your fighting potential. Double time is only used after the encounter really.  First you shoot 5 times with the shotty and if the enemy is not dead, you bring out the secondary weapon and if the enemy is not dead even after that, then there is a good chance you are dead. Reloading mid-fight is not really a good idea, so I definitely prefer Quick Draw over it.  Quick Slash would normally be pretty meh ability for proxy, but combined with Quick Draw and low ammo pool of Remburg and DE. 50, it's actually an okay backup plan.  Overall, it depends on your playstyle. R22 is more of a hit n run flanker style, while I personally play Proxy more like ""area lockdown"".  Mines work as wards, they have eyes where you don't. With Remburg + DE .50 Proxy has considerable amount of burst (single DE .50 bullet hits body for 20 damage, making it an excellent finisher) and you can easily control a side of a map against small to average threats. For example the right side of Underground where you can close the flood gates or left side of Trainyard's first objective."
Dirtybomb,3d14t0,MoustacheMauve,2,Sun Jul 12 22:38:18 2015 UTC,"Makes sense. I play proxy mostly by flanking. I take an unoccupied route, get a few people from behind or head on if I have to, usually aiming to eliminate medics, and then get out and find a different place to attack from. I really love having looter to stay healthy and double time lets me reset situations. Like I will kill someone and start escaping while reloading, turn on someone chasing me, etc.  I guess I mostly just right click with the stiletto so I dont tend to find quick slash as useful. I do use the machine pistol as a finisher sometimes when I know I am about to need another couple shotgun shells already chambered.  My goal with mines is to scoop as many kills as I can. I am basically trying to diminish the enemies map presence as much as I can to create opening to work on the objective.  Your loadout does sound fine though. I actually used to play with it until I opened an R22 Silver from a regular case."
Dirtybomb,3d14t0,MoustacheMauve,0,Sun Jul 12 22:48:29 2015 UTC,"Tbh with proxy I feel like KE53 has the best perks (for the SMG), but having a second smg is a lot more useful than drilled, you'll pull it out faster than you'll reload.  That said, I still use KE53 because I crafted it, and an iron R23 when I feel like using the remburg, I love both for pubs."
Dirtybomb,3d14t0,AMasonJar,5,Sun Jul 12 22:07:21 2015 UTC,"DE .50 is an excellent pistol, if you have the aim for it and by no means worse than MP 400 (I would actually say it's better as a single shot can deal massive damage).  Only ""advantage"" KE12 has is the second SMG, which personally is not worth two dead perks (pineapple juggler, try hard)."
Dirtybomb,3d14t0,BrainiEpic,1 point,Sun Jul 12 22:45:56 2015 UTC,"TBH, it feels like the first shot hits, but every other bullets goes everywhere with the deagle... shit, it's almost like the cs:go deagle.

Dirtybomb,3d14t0,dieezus,2,Sun Jul 12 23:45:45 2015 UTC,"Tryhard isn't worth it. If you are getting a lot of use out of it, you're bad at Proxy or your team just has no hope of winning.

Unshakable is very interesting, giving her ability to receive less damage from explosions, giving her a chance to reach chokepoints and eventually use Martyrdom to clear them.

Dirtybomb,3d14t0,Lhox,1 point,Mon Jul 13 01:08:35 2015 UTC,it is a negligible difference in terms of DPS stats so I find the higher accuracy better to abuse aimpunch. Your DPS number is fairly irrelevant when you are missing shots.

Dirtybomb,3d14t0,Sushigut,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:31:31 2015 UTC,"Why would it be better? It has a lower rate of fire and same damage which leads to lower dps; same clip size, slower reload time."
Dirtybomb,3d14t0,Muugle,2,Sun Jul 12 23:40:05 2015 UTC,"Way way much better recoil and spread, can allow you to land way much more shots especially with the aimpunch now where you need to land shots more often."

If not, would that mean you'd have a greater chance of getting the best card each time you trade up for the same merc, as you're eliminating a lesser loadout from the draw pool?"
Dirtybomb,3d14t0,haccapeliitta,1 point,Mon Jul 13 04:24:28 2015 UTC,You can have the same load out multiple times.   I got 3 of the same fragger bronzes and used them towards a silver.    Annoying system in you ask me. But developers gotta eat and pay bill too!

Dirtybomb,3d14t0,Wafflepwn_syrup,1 point,Mon Jul 13 12:08:25 2015 UTC,"Nader has an alternative ""best"" load out with the CR83 card. Quick draw does a lot to help from switching from the Nade launcher back to your primary.  And Spare magazine keeps you in the fight longer in case people aren't dropping ammo as one can expect :^(  Seriously? Fletcher's best Blishlok loadout is the BL33, Once again it's Quickdraw that makes it easier and faster to switch from the Sticky bombs to your weapon or even detonation tool. The ""Lock-On"" augment does jack for him. It also comes with Tough allowing for faster passive regen and Flying pig, which will be useful when they fix that augment.  And Skyhammer not even mentioning the Timmik? Really? T63 Comes with Timmik, Simeon and Bat. Explodydendron, Failsafe and Quickslash. There is more reason to use the Timmik than the BR-16 on Skyhammer, and this loadout gives good CQC, especially with fast flashes on a wide range bat."

Dirtybomb,3d14t0,shermanikk,-2,Sun Jul 12 23:02:29 2015 UTC,"Some of them are outdated because of the patch.  Like for Nader the best cards are the Crotzni with Focus and Double Time, and the Hochfir with Focus and Double Time.   Also, for every merc that can get Focus, it's the best perk now for them. Patch changed the meta. Focus or die now."
Dirtybomb,3d14t0,4812622,8,Sun Jul 12 17:40:44 2015 UTC,literally no. I can top frag without focus in min level 10 servers. It's not AS important as people are making it out to be but having focus is still a benefit.
Dirtybomb,3d14t0,Keldrath,0,Sun Jul 12 20:48:18 2015 UTC,Honestly I think it's just important on Vassili/sparks since you have to make the shots count.

Dirtybomb,3d14t0,Lhox,-1,Mon Jul 13 01:20:31 2015 UTC,The M4A1 loadout with Focus is better on Fragger than the one without it.

Dirtybomb,3d14t0,Stuhlgewitter,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:44:10 2015 UTC,"Yes. It is happening. Sawbones has another viable loadout with crotzni focus extra supplies and something else.

Dirtybomb,3d14t0,BearPawsOG,-2,Mon Jul 13 12:23:49 2015 UTC,"It's not even because of the aimpunch change. Focus has always been a ridicilously good perk.  The way I see it, you can avoid explosives better than you can avoid aimpunch, ergo Focus is better than Unshakeable."

Dirtybomb,3d4sif,-Zoner,2,Mon Jul 13 16:04:20 2015 UTC,"Fingers cross, would not protest.  Fletcher mostly on the bugs/usability front."
Dirtybomb,3d4sif,DOGpls,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:10:09 2015 UTC,"I recommend him highly. I have alll the mercs so far, bar vasilly, and kira. Fletcher is by far the most fun to play of all those. He is really dynamic, fast play high movement works with the stickys. Those stickys are your primary, have them ready to throw at the target first.   With stickies as primary, the Anhuld is like the perfect companion, imho. It has a slightly longer range, tighter spread than the other shotties and that sweet spot range matches it feels perfectly with the stickies range of throw. One sticky, on hit of the shotty and you can melt nearly all classes. The burst damage potential is really high, thats always good. He is quite able to go full CQC offense, and is a solid defender of choke points, he can own them even vs rhino, no worries. Stickies recharge quick, space them.  I dont like shotties really, started playing him with SMG, but fletcher at Blishocks range is useless really, as you need to pick fights in your stickies range.  EMP9 is better than blishock in close range as its ROF is the highest in game I think, it melts people if you hit some heads and keep highly mobile. EMP works ok jumping, lots of bullets very quickly. It is a pocket SMG, not a big pistol..  You get a shotty which is accurate out to quite a way, awesome up close. The highest RPM pocket LMG, with Double Time, Tough, Lock On. Quick health gen is awesome in any FPS and you are often taking some damage to nail stickies. Double time is a must have on fletch for me as I play it real mobile jumpy so you can reload without slowing. lock on is BS, so you can get this at IRON and have it good as it gets. I have other loadouts but, this has become the only one I use now, despite hating shotties before.  Have fun, you wont regret buying him if you did, you sure might the others or quickly bore of them.  I use A31 guardian close assault."

As in even if you think specific cards are p2w, the skins give players cosmetic incentives to use less optimal cards, e.g. if someone gets a Cobalt Phantom card that isn't the KEK + Chopper + Longer Invis loadout, they may actually use it just because the skin looks better."
Dirtybomb,3d3sdn,SALARYMAN_MAN,2,Mon Jul 13 14:45:19 2015 UTC,"With the RNG card crafting I think it's interesting how it can make people play less with ""meta cards"".   What I mean with this is that when people get their hands on gold and cobalt cards, they might be more likely to play using less common perk combinations. This leads to more variance both to them and their opponents, possibly causing them to not get bored of the game as fast.  Obviously this is just my own spitballing, and I don't have any data to support it."
Dirtybomb,3d3sdn,tfezz,0,Mon Jul 13 15:59:02 2015 UTC,"This also results in people using less than ideal cards though,  so it can cause non optimal play.  We really need a way to reroll a rarity we have."

If 1000 people each had a budget of 1000k to spend, and they tried to turn all lead/irons into bronzes, then on average they would end up with: 154 bronzes, 23 silvers, and 7 golds.

Middle mouse is set to alt fire/iron sights for when I'm using melee/Vassili.  One pretty mandatory bind IMO is to switch out 'quick melee' to something else pronto. Doing a quick melee is actually slower than just pulling out your knife and doing a light attack. You want to get into that habit pretty early on for when you're gibbing downed mercs. I have scroll down set to equip melee, and scroll up set to equip primary, so switching between the two rapidly isn't clunky.  Focus is easily one of the most valuable perks for loadout cards atm, given the recent changes to the aimpunch system. Contrary to the perk's text, it effects hip-firing as well, which is pretty much all you should be doing. Some of the best loadouts already have Focus, such as with Bushwacker and Fragger, but for others you'll have to make sacrifices- Sawbonez can get Focus, but he sacrifices Get Up to do so, which is seen as a mandatory medic perk. So it's do  There's an in game command for setting long jumps to one button using the console: https://www.reddit.com/r/Dirtybomb/comments/3cf97k/how_to_bind_the_long_jump_to_a_single_button/  Have fun!"
Dirtybomb,3d42bg,Hat_Stealer,-1,Mon Jul 13 18:45:16 2015 UTC,For sawbones the crotzni is the best smg and the blishlok is pretty underpowered.   Wether it is wise to get bushwacker instead of a card for sawbonez is depends which augments the bushwacker has and if you actually like/ do good at playing bushwacker. In the end you will probably get bushwacker anyway (because it's the most versatile engineer). So the impact the your choice has isn't great.

Dirtybomb,3d42bg,XohleT,1 point,Mon Jul 13 12:23:40 2015 UTC,This post is on the frontpage right now and for most of the mercs are true. For bushwacker I favor the C41 (alternative there) over the other because you use your turret most of the time and camp with it near objectives.  For sawbones the primary is more healing based (competitive) and the alternative is more offensive focused which is quite nice in pubs when you mostly rely on your own anyway.
Dirtybomb,3d42bg,SirHnB,-1,Mon Jul 13 12:44:25 2015 UTC,A bind I would suggest is to bind crouch and jump on the same key. If you're using a logitech you can assign a keystroke sequence via the set point software. Other than that remember to do your missions every 3hours since this is what will earn you with the most credits in the long run.

When I asked Matt Higby (former lead designer of Planetside 2) how he dealt with it, his response was simple. In a few words, it was ""It's because they care enough about the game to be passionate about it.""  I've heard it said that the greatest compliment to a chef is finishing your meal, then asking for more. Games are vaguely similar. When a dev receives a complaint, it's an indicator that the player cares enough to voice it. It's a very small subset of players that even bothers to go talk about the game, let alone care about the game's future. And, of course, the more colorful their complaint is, the more obviously they care.  That was what I got out of my time on Planetside 2. And it was no doubt that reasoning, plus copious amounts of alcohol, which enabled Matt to get through his day."

Just in the last few weeks we've had so many negative posts. First the whole XGINCODE3 collecting your information to Phantom ruining the game to aimpunch ruining the game. People have no patience these days and scream and shout about every single thing, even if it isn't as bad as it seems. Sure, the game has some balancing flaws at the moment, but the game didn't magically get ruined by Phantom.   Maps favor certain sides a bit too much, some mercs are blatantly better than others, the game has performance issues for some people, the servers sometimes randomly restart or just kick everyone, despite their ping being fine, the UI is slow and sometimes unresponsive and there are a lot of timers from the main menu til you actually reach gameplay.

So they can run around invisible and still absorb 100 damage even if they have 10% duration left."
Dirtybomb,3d0fsa,treycook,8,Sun Jul 12 16:35:25 2015 UTC,"Seems that damage subtracts from the shield until it reaches zero, with no spill over.  As an example, say your shield/health is at 100/120 and you take 150 pts damage from one explosive. Your shield/health ends up at 0/120.  If your shield/health is at 1/120, and you take 150 pts damage from one explosive, your shield/health still ends up at 0/120. It's subtracting solely from the former counter. Once that counter is finally at zero, hits begin to apply to your HP counter.  So, as a Phantom you can walk your happy ass over one Proxy mine and take zero damage -- but not a pair of them. This has been my experience testing with Proxy mines, anyway. I can't say with absolute certainty that it's the same against every weapon/explosive."

Dirtybomb,3d0fsa,Catechin,2,Sun Jul 12 18:09:22 2015 UTC,"B) SD had said that phantom was not getting fixed   They said they weren't going to kneejerk nerf, there's a difference.  They're looking at phantom extremely carefully right now.  For what it's worth, I don't think phantom is far off the mark.  And, yes, I agree that paying is optional.  Still, because it is an option, SD has opened themselves up to a higher level of criticism."
Dirtybomb,3d0fsa,Pandours,1 point,Sun Jul 12 18:17:40 2015 UTC,"We have paid for the game so it is normal to require a balanced game and by the way since you start a cash shop it is no longer really a beta.  Phantom is way too OP. Don't get me wrong here I have invested money because I really like the game and enjoy playing it. Although I would like to play it now,  and not wait 3 months to have a proper game experience."
Dirtybomb,3d0fsa,Keldrath,5,Sun Jul 12 18:17:19 2015 UTC,"in a beta    That's right, it's a beta. That means this is precisely the time to complain about shit."
Dirtybomb,3d0fsa,mintfoot,3,Sun Jul 12 20:59:02 2015 UTC,There's a difference between giving feedback and complaining. Feedback was given and they're going to work on phantom. what more do people expect?

Dirtybomb,3d0fsa,vonmonologue,-2,Sun Jul 12 14:05:24 2015 UTC,"I haven't been having fun this last week.  The nader + sparks rotation was making for a rough game recently anyway, with every objective area just being under constant barrage of grenades and enemies being rezzed faster than you can finish them.   And then they threw in Mr. Super Human God Damn Turn Invisible And Kill You In 2 Hits Phantom  Who most people aren't even good enough to play, and I can usually see him coming and get off several bursts into him before he gets to me, and I still die.   It's not fun dying to a phantom. It feels like it has nothing to do with the skill of either player. It doesn't feel like a challenge that can be won via skill, it feels like a janky gimmick that you need pure luck and a shitty phantom player to overcome.   It's just been a garbage rotation and I can't wait til it ends."
Dirtybomb,3d0fsa,Catechin,5,Sun Jul 12 14:24:07 2015 UTC,"I'm usually top of the board when I'm playing not phantom.  Put me on phantom and I'm mid tier.  I'm so bad at Phantom it's not even funny, lol.  I don't find Phantom to be an issue.  Once you've died to cloaked banshees or Garen In A Bush a hundred times, you learn to deal with stealth in general.  360 degree situational awareness is a skill.  One that Phantom punishes when one lacks."
Dirtybomb,3d0fsa,DastardlyCoxcomb,4,Sun Jul 12 14:57:30 2015 UTC,"You are assuming that people don't like Phantom for his stealth. People don't like that he has everything in one package. He has stealth, which forces way more awareness than usual and disrupts aiming. He has a shield, which allows him to tank regardless of shield gating or not(it just makes it worse). He has a melee weapon with a long range which oneshots squishies and almost oneshots mediums(they die if they have scratch damage on them). And on top of all that he has a KEK10, which is almost unanimously considered the best Operative weapon in the game. Obviously, he doesn't have explosives, rezzes or engineer abilities, but his combo platter of abilities gives him too much utility and killing potential at least in pubs.  To clarify, I don't think that he is ultra grossly OP. He is just too easy to play and is slightly overtweaked."

Fourth, you have to hope for a balanced or at least a decently competitive enemy team.

Most of the times had 2-3 of us getting a timeout in 'joining server', we had the occasional teammember getting a force close/crash of the game, we had some instances where we ended up with 6v4 and 7v3 groups so the match wouldn't start etc.  The first few times you are... ""ahh well 3rd time is the charm!"", but when even the 10th time is not the charm and it takes a while between each found match and the next, you can conclude (competitive) matchmaking can still use some work. :("

Why should you need an incentive to play ranked, other than being able to get a rank? That would just make people play ranked for reasons other than rank.

I have almost 4.000h in dota2 and dirty bomb is the first game since yeara that actually drags me away from dota in a good way. I enjoy every single moment without any real anger. The biggest problem is the community, that forces the developers to change the game and make the game adapt to the player and not the other way around. Suggestions are fine, but all this rant, whining and circlejerking gets out of hand already. Its time for a decent community site for the silent majority.  We should give the developers credit for their work and be thankful fpr the chance to be part of such a great experience. Dont be ungreatful and mean.

That wasn't the point of my comment. I was just arguing that the devs shouldn't be free from criticism just because they are making a f2p game. They should listen to player feedback, but ultimately leave it to the professionals to decide on making changes."

Dirtybomb,3d1sc2,Wimperator,2,Sun Jul 12 22:45:04 2015 UTC,"It seems that people believe kicking a huge fuss over every issue, including smaller ones, is the only way for them to enact change.   I'm not a huge fan of Phantom, but I wish people would temper their outrage a bit and stop using apocalyptic terminology so liberally. Just because a change is net negative doesn't mean it's going to kill the game completely. This community and reddit in general needs to learn that by flying off the handle every time you're upset by something it becomes difficult for a dev, community manager, or potential consumer to sort the legitimate criticisms from the noise.   If anyone at Splash Damage reads this: I'm having a great time with your game, it's one that my friend and I can envision playing for a while, and a wish you all the best in implementing everything."

Mostly would have just split the already smallish community.  I miss the movement...not really the crouch sliding but everything else felt really fun to master. Learning to move fast in that game was rewarding and not AS difficult as Quake3. I was about 4 days from releasing a trick jump video AND a trick jump map...then they changed the movement slightly that made some of my jumps stop working and I quit after years of playing.

He's wasn't really THAT easy to play, but the fact that the minigun isn't really a victim of aimpunch has made him amazing. And it makes it almost impossible for other people to hit you when you're shaking their screen all over with the minigun.  I've never had much of an issue with fighting him, but the reality is I usually play with some buddies in pubs. It's rare to find a competent rhino and even when there is if he doesn't have an Aura he's usually pretty easy to steamroll."

In the first 10 games the system calculates your score based on your wins/loses (I dont think performance inside the game matters) and after that every win increases score and every loss decreases your score.

Dirtybomb,3d3vn2,Precipere,-4,Mon Jul 13 14:02:43 2015 UTC,Focus only affects aim punch while you are iron sighted.   Generally you will only use iron sights to aim at people farther away when you just need to for the extra zoom so its not going to affect any real firefights you have.

Dirtybomb,3d3vn2,infamousNL,0,Mon Jul 13 11:25:44 2015 UTC,The biggest factor that influences your aim is the tweaking of sens. So that is probably it. Try to stay on a fairly low sens and keep it for a while. This should improve you aim. Just don't switch it up that much.
Dirtybomb,3d3vn2,Xionix1,1 point,Mon Jul 13 08:59:25 2015 UTC,im currently using 1000dpi with in game sensitivity of 7 (to allow a 180 degree turn with a single swipe) as I don't have large hands/arms to accommodate massive swipes..
Dirtybomb,3d3vn2,vampwood,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:31:40 2015 UTC,0.o that's pretty high. Are you still able to track enemies? I'm using 400 dpi with a sens of 6.5ish. If you find it difficult to swipe 180s change your positioning to where you almost never run into this situation. So keep your back against walls etc.
Dirtybomb,3d3vn2,infamousNL,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:46:50 2015 UTC,o.0 that's considered high? I use 1800dpi with 15 sens lol.
Dirtybomb,3d3vn2,infamousNL,2,Mon Jul 13 15:14:12 2015 UTC,"Yes thats insanely high, 20cm-40cm/360 is generally standard for most pros. The lower the sensitivity you use the better you can track with, and as long as you can follow people fast enough to not lose them, having a super high sens doesn't make sense. If you want fast spin times and low sens for tracking, use acceleration, but only from povohats mouse driver.  I use 400 dpi and 12 sensitivity in game, with an acceleration that puts it up to around 16 at my highest turn rate, and at its lowest 10.  At most you want to be using 800 dpi with a lower sensitivity to compensate, while higher DPI can lead to slightly more accuracy with the sensor, it becomes harder to adjust sensitivity downward enough to make it slow enough to actually aim with.  If you're interested in using acceleration, heres the mouse driver that I use. http://accel.drok-radnik.com/ Its a somewhat tricky install but well worth it.  When you adjust sens, give it a day to play with before rage switching back, if you've played long on a super high sensitivity, your muscle memory is off and will take a bit to relearn it."

Dirtybomb,3d6k4h,Pzychotix,5,Mon Jul 13 22:38:58 2015 UTC,Guess I could of mentioned that...but Phantom and aimpunch flat out destroyed this game for me.  I know the developers are aware of it but I doubt they will fix it the way it should be.  I have heard horror stories about their previous game Brink that I shrugged off when people told me about them until this recent patch.  Now I see what they mean.

I can't even play proxy anymore cause of Phantom...Long jump + right click too strong. Doesn't even matter if I HS him or back peddle cause his shield blocks so much damage and 1 shots me....  I'm gonna quit too if aimpunch doesn't get reverted back to normal. If I wanted to play a ""realistic"" game or w/e I would be playing BF4 or CS: GO?"

Dirtybomb,3d6k4h,Kittzin,5,Mon Jul 13 23:45:25 2015 UTC,"I can agree...  Every day playing this game has made me more frustrated than the last.  So many deaths caused by aimpunch of which I have no way to counteract.  So many rampaging phantoms going 30+kills.  So many instances where I see, shoot, and headshot the phantom but because he was cloaked with a shield, he then stabs and kills me as a light class.  My favorite classes to play in this game is Kira, Proxy, and Aura... I can't play these classes with phantoms running around with their mega 195hp shields one shotting me or the aimpunch in fights that completely disrupt my aiming skill because they shot me first.  Save us from this hell, before we decide to leave it on our own accord."
Dirtybomb,3d6k4h,jred26,2,Mon Jul 13 23:52:36 2015 UTC,"What did the patch change? You don't say in your post, nor can I find patch notes."
Dirtybomb,3d6k4h,LLAMATARIANISM,3,Mon Jul 13 22:40:59 2015 UTC,"It tweaked aimpunch, making it much more jarring and annoying, and introduced Phantom, who is blatantly OP. But the devs have been reading reddit and the forums. They are perfectly aware that we want aimpunch reduced, and they are perfectly aware that Phantom is OP (they didn't put him in the new rotation)."
Dirtybomb,3d6k4h,ControlPhreakk,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:50:12 2015 UTC,"Let's stick to the facts, Phantom is getting some tweaks. They never straight up said that he is OP. Besides, he wouldn't have gone on rotation anyway. Newly released mercs don't go on rotation the week after they are released."
Dirtybomb,3d6k4h,LLAMATARIANISM,3,Tue Jul 14 00:18:33 2015 UTC,"You say ""tweaks,"" by which you mean nerfs (if they do buff one aspect of him they'll absolutely be nerfing another), and you don't nerf things that are balanced.  Also I swear Sparks went out the rotation after she was released? I have a shit memory though."
Dirtybomb,3d6k4h,ControlPhreakk,2,Tue Jul 14 00:21:47 2015 UTC,"It will most likely be nerfs, but that doesn't mean that they stated that he was OP.   You're actually right. Sparks came out on the 18th of June and was in the rotation that started on the 1st of July. I must have been thinking of other F2P games where characters don't go on rotation that early. MissMurder stated this:   Phantom isn't in the free rotation because he hasn't been out for at least 2 weeks yet. In the past new Mercs have been in the following free rotation because that's the schedule we were trying to stick with- since there have been delays on updates the rotation has been affected. Even if there isn't an update we think it's important to keep the rotations bi-weekly. -MissMurder"
Dirtybomb,3d6k4h,LLAMATARIANISM,2,Tue Jul 14 00:29:47 2015 UTC,"Well yeah, they never stated it. But it's sorta implied   MissMurder stated this:   She posted that on my thread :P  I actually joined right as the free rotation with Kira in it ended so I don't have that much experience with the rotations and new characters. I was really confused when the characters I could play suddenly changed."
Dirtybomb,3d6k4h,ControlPhreakk,2,Tue Jul 14 09:23:30 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I guess you're right. I just hope that people don't expect some huge nerfs when the next patch hits."
Dirtybomb,3d6k4h,LLAMATARIANISM,2,Tue Jul 14 13:32:32 2015 UTC,"The devs stated that they aren't going to make any major gameplay changes to him, so you're right, they shouldn't expect major nerfs. Frankly, he doesn't need major nerfs. Although it's a bit annoying to me that they probably won't remove his damage negation."
Dirtybomb,3d6k4h,ControlPhreakk,2,Tue Jul 14 13:42:51 2015 UTC,"I would personally like for them to change the way his katana-lunge works. Either they need to fix the fact that he can hit multiple people with one lunge, or remove the ability to redirect the blow if the Phantom misses. I've been killed so many times by Phantoms who miss and then redirect their blow."

Block off the stupidly overpowered ones which allow you to look through walls, ect. Small gimmicks, like nade jumping, increases the skill cap for advanced movement. Look at bunny hopping on some of the older Source games, for example.  I was practising and trying to find new trick jumps and found a lot of places blocked by an invisible wall or some random object. If these walls/objects are removed (in reasonable area's only) then I could see the skill cap for trick jumping go through the roof. A lot of the time, I'm thinking ""Why can't I jump up there and what harm would it do if I could?"" because it's blocked by a silly invisible barrier."

I've had a hell of a time finding the damn things before if you don't catch sight of the initial arming pulse, and there are plenty situations where you can put it behind a wall that makes it impossible to get a shot on without being detected at least once.  Creative HBS throws are really difficult to neutralize before they've done their job or at least wasted your time."

Dirtybomb,3d4u1e,-equalist,2,Mon Jul 13 18:04:25 2015 UTC,"Yes I have not outlined any specific data why a mouse is more precise, it can be moved quickly and more accurately.  One reason is the movement space, the amount of area a mouse can sweep across is much larger giving more accuracy it can also be moved at a speed that would not be contolable on joystick.  The way a joystick can compensate is by increasing sensitivity, this faster response is unfortunately coupled to a decrease in precision.  Sorry I am bad at explaining this :(  Edit: don't get me wrong you can precisely aim anddamageswith a controller if you are good, but it is the combination of having to rapidly move you screen around, acquire you target, as well as movement aspects like wall jumping and air straifing, and rapid weapon switching.  It is just not feasible.  Edit 2:  I am not try to talk down to you because you prefer a controller there are just something that a mouse/keyboard is better for just like there are things a controller is superior for.  Either way I do not think that controller support is in splash damage's scope, this would come if they disided to do a console port which they have stated is not within there sights as far as development goes."

Splash damage and every other player that play this game seriously thinks that phantom is strong but no where near op because they are AWARE of him. The problem is that Splashdamage worked on him internally which makes it extremely hard for them to know how it would work on people that are not on the same level as they are. This game is in BETA if u have the feeling they just release him for the money you clearly dont know the developers and you clearly should consider doing something else with your time. Phantom will get adjusted soon so stop this crying over him every 5th post on this subreddit is basically a cry thread. He WILL be different next patch SD already told EVERYONE.

If you do your missions twice a day you should end up with between 3,000 and 6,000 credits every day. You only get credits for levelling up for the first few levels - after that, you don't get any.  Kira is overall an okay class. She's not as solid as Skyhammer, but she's not as UP as Arty. She's quite difficult to use with the current state of aimpunch. Don't use the Stark AR by the way, the BR-16 is just better.  The laser is pretty cool."

Not had any real issues with the aim punch, so lack of Focus hasn't bothered me (yet, atleast). A well placed laser can salvage a lot of games. She's a bit squishy though, so you have to make sure to use your speed to your advantage.  And yes, you only get money for ranking up in the beginning, but you don't really rely on money from rounds, as much as you do the money from the missions you get every three hours, which can give you between 500 and 1000 credits each."

Dirtybomb,3d0vbf,Jawnnn,3,Sun Jul 12 19:16:46 2015 UTC,"The laser is a blast (heh) to use. There's so much you can do with it when you get the hang of it.

That way you don't worry about getting canceled by aimpunch and the enemies dont see it coming either."

Dirtybomb,3d0vbf,landlubber12,5,Sun Jul 12 19:43:42 2015 UTC,"Kira is one of my favorites, I'm torn between her and Fletcher. The only issue she has right now is that Phantom can easily one shot her with the katana.  She is really useful on certain maps, not so much on others. This is because her laser doesn't work inside. Some places it doesn't work at all, others you have to shoot out the glass ceilings first. She is best on Chapel and then Trainyard. Mediocre on Bridge and Terminal. Not that great on Underground. This is because on the last three levels listed her laser only works on parts of the map (on underground pretty much just the bomb planting points).  Given all of this, her laser is very useful, you can wipe out an entire team if they are lined up or grouped up correctly. You can also prevent C4 disarms by dropping the laser on top of the C4, or block paths by dropping the laser in front of doorways/alleys. She is also useful for taking out EVs, although not as useful as Skyhammer.   If you like the Dreiss and can manage without the fast reload card, you can even go for the card with repair speed increase, which will make her very well rounded (faster repairs and defuses). However the faster reload card is probably the best choice for the Dreiss.  I didn't like her ammo station at first, but it is very useful too. You can drop it at your spawn so everybody starts with full ammo (and you get shit tons of XP), or you can drop it near your team at the front, so they don't run out of ammo while in combat. I usually do a mix of the two. Leave it at spawn until I run out of ammo, then drop it next to players at the frontline, then when I die, drop it back at the spawn.  If you do try her force yourself to try both the BR-16 and the Dreiss even if you suck with one of them. Both are good weapons."
Dirtybomb,3d0vbf,TwoThreeSkidoo,2,Sun Jul 12 20:17:09 2015 UTC,Cash from rounds is pretty shit. Missions and daily bonuses are where 80% of your cash will come from.
Dirtybomb,3d0vbf,SgtTittyfist,2,Sun Jul 12 17:00:27 2015 UTC,"Kira's fun. Her laser is really powerful at area denial and EV disabling. Her ammo station is really underrated, but is pretty good. As for her weapons, I think she's in a pretty good spot. She's mostly a mid-long range fighter, so keep that in mind. I haven't played her much recently, but I own the character and she's fun. For the most part, I think of her as an improved Arty, although I still play more Arty. She's definitely very strong at long/mid range firepower."
Dirtybomb,3d0vbf,Usually_that_guy,2,Sun Jul 12 18:23:34 2015 UTC,"Kira has 3 very solid weapons. Most people prefer the dreiss atm but a  good eye with the stark goes a very long way. Hitting a headshot in a burst will net you 90 damage and at the very least 60ish damage if you miss a bullet.  Most people use the br-16 with 3 extra rounds. I prefer the stark personally, as I prefer picking my fights at mid-long range and with the more functional scope in the game atm you become accurate enough to be worth the lowered movement speed. Using your speed to pick your fights is key for kira"
Dirtybomb,3d0vbf,Yoddd,2,Sun Jul 12 23:14:10 2015 UTC,"I love Kira and here's something I don't see other Kira players utilize as much: Using the Ammo Dispenser as cover, wall, or early-warning system.   I like putting it down stairs or doors when I go for a flank and get to an MG - enemy mercs have to destroy it to get past and phantoms have to uncloak to destroy the thing - wasting their time and providing me early warning that I am being flanked.  Can also put it down on the blocker carriage's doors on Trainyard or the last 2 C4 boxes on terminal to stop or delay Proxies from rushing in.  The thing is also surprisingly tanky and has saved me a lot of times just by plopping it down in front of me when I am in a bad spot and using it as cover."
Dirtybomb,3d0vbf,LosingSteak,3,Mon Jul 13 05:38:27 2015 UTC,"Incredible area denial for objectives, and if you can land the first shot of whatever primary weapon she's using you're golden in a duel. She's in a good spot, unlike Arty."

Dirtybomb,3d0vbf,PoisonedAl,2,Mon Jul 13 04:45:09 2015 UTC,"First of all, go here and get a code for Fragger for free.  Now you have a damage dealer, let's look at your lack of engie. It's really good to have a objective specialist on hand to fast plant/defuse C4 and fix the EV. I would buy ether Proxy or Bushwacker. I like Bushwacker more for the cover the turret gives, but Proxy gets more kills with her hateful mines.  Edit. typo. Oh, and while I'm here, Kira is nice but you have Skyhammer. You really need one of each class of merc before getting different flavors of the same type."

Dirtybomb,3d0vbf,caitsith01,1 point,Sun Jul 12 18:20:50 2015 UTC,"Kira is probably my favourite merc to use.  If you get the hang of her guns (especially the semi-auto) she can be brutal over range.  So long as you nail the first shot and generally aren't too bad at headshots, you will take down many opponents.  Excellent if you enjoy a genuine 'support' role that actually involves providing suppressing/supporting fire from medium range, and equally good in one-on-one duels over range.  The orbital strike is IMHO also the best anti-EV weapon due to its tight focus.  Her biggest weakness is close quarters stuff, where the semi-auto gun is tough to use well.  You have to constantly try to keep distance from your opponent.  However, warning, since Phantom has existed playing as Kira has sucked a lot more.  Due to the playstyle she invites (hanging back a bit and engaging from range) she is vulnerable to Phantom-griefers creeping around behind enemy lines, and it is also quite hard to actually see Phantom from range with her as her best gun has no scope.  Also, because she has low-ish health, Phantom can one-hit-kill her.  So I would wait if I were you, to see if/when they nerf Phantom or somehow give Kira and a few others a better response to Phantom."
Dirtybomb,3d0vbf,SC2_Bench,1 point,Mon Jul 13 05:06:52 2015 UTC,"While I LOVE Kira I generally can't recommend her to people. Her laser is very restricted on half the maps. She is very fragile so she can be tough to play. I honestly feel like skyhammer is better than her in most situations. She might be the best class on Chapel, though."
Dirtybomb,3d0vbf,Keldrath,-1,Mon Jul 13 07:00:40 2015 UTC,"Love her, and the BR-16 is amazing.  Unfortunately she doesn't get a loadout with Focus so she doesn't fit in the current meta. She's frustrating to play atm because of the aim punch. but so is anyone without Focus."

Proxy gives the most points. Defusing shit and blowing shit up really gives a lot of xp.   Sawbonez is the runner up. He gets some points from kills, a LOT reviving, and a metric shit ton from throwing healthpacks at a teammates face.   And then there is Vasilli. He gets a LOT of kills.

Dirtybomb,3d3a10,prodiG,3,Mon Jul 13 04:58:32 2015 UTC,"Most of that is from badges. In any game that lasts longer than 10 minutes I'm getting enough of these to fill the screen in the post-game lobby.   Killstreaks, aces, objective and support milestones, generally just playing the game well means you get a high score.  http://dirtybomb.gamepedia.com/Badge"
Dirtybomb,3d3a10,VSPinkie,2,Mon Jul 13 06:35:00 2015 UTC,"Badge bonuses go a loooong way toward top score if they're just fragging.  Kill streaks (painfully easy because you continue your streak if revived, trivial godlike medals everywhere if you're trying at all with a decent medic), multikills (massive window for chaining together, most pubstomps will yield at least 2 or 3 Aces, which are worth crazy xp because it includes triples and quads along the way), and making sure to finish your kills every time.  If it's another melee Phantom running around farming pubs, he gets ludicrous amounts of bonus points from melee badges alone throughout the match; Finish Him basically doubles his point yield per kill plus milestone bonuses up to 20 each round."
Dirtybomb,3d3a10,VSPinkie,1 point,Mon Jul 13 05:34:40 2015 UTC,"So basically, if the other team doesnt have a phantom going ham, use my own phantom (which I own) to get points? Do you just melee people the whole time for best xp or what?"
Dirtybomb,3d3a10,haccapeliitta,6,Mon Jul 13 06:05:30 2015 UTC,"If you're gonna farm pubs with Phantom there's really no bad way to do it, it's ridiculously easy and will basically cause the game to come to a grinding halt as everyone stops playing to complain in chat.  (this is an excellent time to stab them again)  Get the katana + chopper build, prioritize melee kills when safe because they yield a ton of points, but emphasize survival and remember that the KEK is your actual primary weapon.  99% of the players you encounter will make no effort to avoid your katana, but when you encounter that rare genius who actually starts backing away and shooting you, don't try to force the issue.  Just use your cloak to survive and engage with your KEK once you've safely recharged.  A downed melee Phantom will get finished every time and you want to be able to get rezed to continue your streak for best point yield, so know when to back off.  Basically, play like a total cancerous douche and get rewarded outrageously for it.  Or play any other merc, just do your job and don't sweat his broken point yield.  Really though, in all seriousness for once, prioritize helping your team win.  Don't actually do this shit and expect anyone to be impressed, because you can be the top scorer and still not be much of a help if you're just farming.  Even in a pub, your first duty is to the team."

Dirtybomb,3d0q83,DropZeHamma,12,Sun Jul 12 15:33:02 2015 UTC,"~80 hours played. Many of the missions seem to motivate me to approach the game counter to typical play, from my experience.   Play n games  Ill just hop on Proxy or Bush and corpse-flop my way through the objective to get the game over with as quickly as possible. I may go 3-25 KDR, but I need it over and done with. Earn XX,XXX combat experience  I load up with Vassili and/or Phantom and pub stomp my way to easy exp. Much to the shagrin of everyone involved, my team included. Earn XX,XXX support experience  Grab Arty, shove ammo down people's throats for a few games. I am more concerned with sufficiently laying out my ammo in everyone's run path at the spawn, than getting to the objective and defusing the C4. Earn XX,XXX game mode experience  Again, just hop on an engineer and corpse-flop around the tank. Make sure to rush to any constructables/plant sites so that I can get the exp before my teammates do.   The only missions that don't seem to influence my gameplay in this manner are ""win n games"" (which has its own problems, as OP pointed out) or ""play n games with mercenary X in your squad."" Of the two, I find the latter to be the most conducive to varying the composition of matches, while not interrupting the team/objective focus of the match itself.  I'm not happy about it, and I don't have any solutions that come to mind, but I wanted to express that it does alter my approach to the game. But once I've powered through my 3 missions in an hour or so, I'm back to playing the game how I normally would -- helping people up, focusing on the objectives, covering the flank, etc."
Dirtybomb,3d0q83,treycook,5,Sun Jul 12 17:34:52 2015 UTC,"The problem with the ""Earn X experience of type Y"" is because the numbers are way too high.  So high that you simply can't play normally and still get them done.  I mean, 22k combat experience?  How many games is that?  If I'm earning 4k a game, and that's pure fragging 30 kills a match, I'm still completing this mission in 6 games.  There's one that's about 10k support experience.  If I'm playing medic normally I'm lucky to break 2k through normal play.  I can do 3k if I do absolutely nothing but spam ammo packs to the detriment of my team.    My only problem with game mode experience is not all game mode actions are rewarded.  Killing the data core holder?  Nothing.  Defending the data core capture point?  Nothing.  I spent a solid 10 minutes with bushwacker defending the last capture on train, never returned the core once and my game mode experience at the end was a whopping 34.  Apparently I wasn't playing the objective despite never leaving the objective once.    Edit:  Just got a 15750 support experience mission.  Man, that's a lot of ammo."
Dirtybomb,3d0q83,SteadyFrunkin,2,Sun Jul 12 20:51:20 2015 UTC,"I think it might be better if the missions just had a longer time window and the credit reward was increased to compensate. That way you could play the game normally and still get rewarded for participating in certain ways.  That, or they could drastically reduce the requirements, as you've said."
Dirtybomb,3d0q83,treycook,2,Sun Jul 12 21:21:23 2015 UTC,"For me most of the missions come naturally. Combat is easy just from fragging, support only stops me from playing a small portion of the mercs, and game mode can be done by anyone if you understand how the objective experience is delivered. Best of all, all of these can be completed on the playlist you enjoy the most. They're not perfect, but I've never found myself aggravated by any of them, unlike the ones in my original post."
Dirtybomb,3d0q83,Xionix1,6,Mon Jul 13 03:10:34 2015 UTC,This is a problem with almost all the missions to an extent.  Support XP mission forces you to play a character that can spam ammo packs or a medic and hope that you are able to get a bunch of healing done. Gamemode XP forces you to play an objective specialist as any other class takes way too long to do any objective and this is really annoying when your team already has several of that role.  In my opinion these missions also take way too long to complete. The 3 star version requires something ridiculous like 22000 XP which seems to take me like 8 games to do.  I also find that I never actually play this game once my missions are done as the credits received for actually playing the game is so low that it seems like a bad time investment to play while the missions are on cooldown when I could just do something else and play later when the missions are back instead.
Dirtybomb,3d0q83,whatseiko1,2,Sun Jul 12 17:29:08 2015 UTC,"I'm sure the design purpose of those missions is to spread out the playerbase so they try new things. Otherwise you might get too many empty stopwatch servers or too many people playing a single merc.   As for the win x games, I don't think you should take it too seriously. If it feels like such a chore that you have to complete and may get toxic if you don't, then think about the actual value of the reward. It might get you 500 credits towards a 50,000 credit merc valued at $10. That's   10 cents of real world value..."
Dirtybomb,3d0q83,fireoftheabyss,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:13:00 2015 UTC,"It's a game, no one's going to view it based on its ""actual value"". I see a mission as a challenge to complete and understandably get frustrated when I play exceptionally and still lose, or the most effective way to complete my mission is to throw. The difference in how I feel after playing really well and losing is entirely dependent on whether I was only there to complete a mission or not. I understand the design purpose, but I don't like the outcome (for reasons stated)."
Dirtybomb,3d0q83,JustiniZHere,2,Mon Jul 13 03:04:39 2015 UTC,"How's about they just remove the mission system, and buff credit gained during the match by a big amount. That, in addition to some other potential bonuses like filling niche roles will not only make pub games less of a shithole, but make sure new players aren't turned off by getting only 96 credits per game."
Dirtybomb,3d0q83,slider2k,2,Mon Jul 13 01:54:39 2015 UTC,"I just drop all win stopwatch missions, stopwatch is awful and is not enjoyable to me. That aside it would be nice if we could reroll one mission per reset cycle, would give some leeway to those awful xp quest/win x games."
Dirtybomb,3d0q83,slider2k,1 point,Mon Jul 13 04:14:49 2015 UTC,Re-rolling missions sounds great.
Dirtybomb,3d0q83,kirenasura,2,Mon Jul 13 23:26:33 2015 UTC,"If you really want to min-max ""Play x missions"" just join games in progress hopefully those with short timer left. All that counts for the mission is seeing the ending score screen. There, saved you from ""throwing games intentionally""."
Dirtybomb,3d0q83,BrainiEpic,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:38:29 2015 UTC,"So, your plan is to join a game where someone has left (most likely because their team is losing), putting yourself in a situation where you could be the key ingredient to push your team to victory, but don't want to so that it ends faster. Not seeing how this isn't an incentive to throw. Note that I, of course, join games in progress when I'm nailing out completion missions (obviously)."
Dirtybomb,3d0q83,DarylSG,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:00:22 2015 UTC,You're pushing this too far. If timer isn't short or it is going to be extended just join another game.
Dirtybomb,3d0q83,TwoThreeSkidoo,1 point,Mon Jul 13 05:23:42 2015 UTC,"Which wastes more time than just throwing. Again, min/max."
Dirtybomb,3d3fg0,Coreball_,3,Mon Jul 13 05:20:23 2015 UTC,"No other assault rifle can really keep up with the M4. The Dreiss does a truckload of damage, but it's even more of a nightmare to control than the BR. The headshot damage is absolutely devastating, but the slow rate of fire and the high spread makes hitting moving targets incredibly difficult.  I'd say it's equally viable as the burst weapons, so feel free to use it on Kira and Arty."
Dirtybomb,3d3fg0,Stuhlgewitter,1 point,Mon Jul 13 05:32:50 2015 UTC,Is the Dreiss similar to the PDP sniper? They do different damages but is it a cross between conventional assault rifles and the sniper?
Dirtybomb,3d3fg0,Stuhlgewitter,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:42:47 2015 UTC,"They're very different rifles, even if they're bot high damage semi-autos. Dreiss rewards accurate shots, but it's by no means a marksman- or sniper-weapon."
Dirtybomb,3d3fg0,Gulrotsaft,3,Mon Jul 13 17:46:05 2015 UTC,I used to love the Dreiss.  After this view kick (or what it's called) adjustments it is only so so.  In short I had come to a point where I could handle both long ranges and close quarters quite good with the Dreiss. Now on the other hand I lose gunfights to level <10 people on medium / close range encounters due to them spamming smg in me left foot :/
Dirtybomb,3d3fg0,mr_banhammer,2,Mon Jul 13 10:59:19 2015 UTC,Dreiss AR is really good. At least in my opinion. I've used it with Arty and seemed to top score with him all the time. The M4 is also really good but in my opinion the model is kind of big.
Dirtybomb,3d3fg0,Tytaine,1 point,Mon Jul 13 05:29:24 2015 UTC,"My understanding is that the M4 is great if you want a simple and easy to use weapon. The BR and Dreiss are there if you can manage their quirks. They can beat out the M4 at times, but you have to be much more consistent with your aim/headshots."
Dirtybomb,3d3fg0,vampwood,1 point,Mon Jul 13 05:42:11 2015 UTC,"The problem is honestly, aimpunch, the br-16 is a monster if your not being shot at, it demolishes light classes, but as soon as you are getting shot it, its mag size is an issue as your shots will miss due to the punch. The m4 handles the punch a little bit better with the more consistent firing and larger mag size"
Dirtybomb,3d3fg0,TeaL3af,1 point,Mon Jul 13 07:05:48 2015 UTC,Am I the only one that finds the Dreiss's firing animation really distracting? Every other gun in the game has quite an understated animation but the Dreiss flies up like 45 degrees.
Dirtybomb,3d3fg0,haunebu_wolf,1 point,Mon Jul 13 06:56:23 2015 UTC,"Arty + Dreiss + Chapel on defence = ownage. Arty may seem weak, but he shines on Chapel (most the EV part). You should ADS with Dreiss because hip fire is not that accurate comparing to other guns. Never jump while shooting Dreiss, it will max your spread for a couple of seconds before it settles down."
Dirtybomb,3d3fg0,fartcar97,1 point,Mon Jul 13 09:40:13 2015 UTC,"One of the best weapons in the game. On par with the M4/Kek and K-12whatever LMG. Requires a different play-style and punishes missed shots. Not really good for your average player, but amazing in the hands of a good player."
Dirtybomb,3d3fg0,slider2k,1 point,Mon Jul 13 05:36:48 2015 UTC,BR: 165 DPS DREISS: 150 DPS M4: 125 DPS
Dirtybomb,3d3fg0,SC2_Bench,2,Mon Jul 13 05:44:05 2015 UTC,The DPS stat for the Dreiss is useless because there is almost no way to maintain maximum firerate AND accuracy on it.
Dirtybomb,3d3fg0,slider2k,5,Mon Jul 13 06:54:00 2015 UTC,Hipfire yes. But ADS stays accurate.
Dirtybomb,3d3fg0,SC2_Bench,0,Mon Jul 13 07:37:02 2015 UTC,the ADS recoils pretty hard and climbs. Unless they are very close you will still have a hard time applying the guns full DPS.
Dirtybomb,3d3fg0,slider2k,1 point,Mon Jul 13 07:58:32 2015 UTC,"Applying full DPS in practice is a pipe dream for any gun. So, what's the point of arguing."
Dirtybomb,3d3fg0,SC2_Bench,1 point,Mon Jul 13 08:11:40 2015 UTC,"sorry, I should clarify, I think it has a much harder time than the other 2 guns applying its full potential. The M4 and BR and much easier to come close to max DPS on than the Dreiss. The Dreiss' main selling point is its greater potential to apply headshot damage. Ruling out headshots, you will more consistently be able to achieve a faster TTK with the other 2 rifles."
Dirtybomb,3d3fg0,slider2k,1 point,Mon Jul 13 08:17:09 2015 UTC,"Well, I agree. As in general rule: more recoil/spread = harder to apply full DPS."
Dirtybomb,3d3fg0,BCR12,0,Mon Jul 13 08:22:26 2015 UTC,"The Dreiss has terrible spread. It has the best fall off damage, but cant hit shit at range when firing at max fire rate."
Dirtybomb,3d3fg0,TemplarBean,1 point,Mon Jul 13 07:24:50 2015 UTC,"Thats because you arent supposed to fire at max fire rate, however when you ADS, the spread is alot better."
Dirtybomb,3d3fg0,BCR12,1 point,Mon Jul 13 09:41:03 2015 UTC,"Well the problem is that the BR-16 can be fired at its max rate and still hit in a tight group at range. Which begs the question, why would I want a gun I have to wait for the bloom to disappear in between shots when there is a faster range killing alternative?  If you want to just stake pot shots with the dreiss, fine. But I aim to be killing people at range."
Dirtybomb,3d3fg0,TemplarBean,1 point,Mon Jul 13 10:12:02 2015 UTC,"Two headshots kills anyone with the Dreiss. The gun is the fastest slayer in the game. Its the only gun you can pop up, fire 3-4 shots in the space of about a second and instakill someone."
Dirtybomb,3d3fao,O_orangeInk,1 point,Mon Jul 13 05:18:48 2015 UTC,There is no long jumping involved in the jumps I'm interested in. Also I've bound crouch to MOUSE2 so I'm quite comfortable long jumping.  Thanks for your post though.

Because I'm pretty sure no one else is using long jumps for these kind of jumps.

Dirtybomb,3d3fao,Fatness,1 point,Mon Jul 13 07:51:40 2015 UTC,"To me it helps to use the mouse to sort of float away, and then back towards the wall while strafing with A and D.   The best place to practice this is on a map with a long wall, that has a floor going downward, giving you leniency with the jump height.   Off the top of my head theres a good section in Trainyard that allows you to do this. After the attackers have completed the second objective, they need to deliver the drug samples to the helicopter. Directly in front of the spot where you pick up these samples is a nice little hallway that you can practice these jumps on.   Hopefully this helps, I'm not the best at trickjumping, but I'm enjoying learning and figuring it out."

Dirtybomb,3d16o0,Rusemaster1,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:48:07 2015 UTC,You don't long jump twice. The first long jump gives you momentum which is carried through the wall jump.

Dirtybomb,3d23uw,Huwmanoid,9,Sun Jul 12 22:19:30 2015 UTC,Never heard that one before
Dirtybomb,3d23uw,Stuhlgewitter,2,Sun Jul 12 22:49:28 2015 UTC,I recently watched a dev stream of this game and they said that they are definitely considering steam trading and the ability to sell stuff on the steam marketplace.
Dirtybomb,3d23uw,Outscold,2,Mon Jul 13 00:29:32 2015 UTC,"The more cards you trade the less cards you buy the less money sd makes. Probably won't happen, would be really nice of them though."
Dirtybomb,3d23uw,Hornfreak,1 point,Mon Jul 13 00:51:06 2015 UTC,"There should be a way of getting rid of cards that just are flat out terrible, cards that nobody would even buy. Like who in their right mind would buy a cobalt Arty with sneaky, focus and chopper?"
Dirtybomb,3d23uw,Lexi8745,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:23:39 2015 UTC,"I like the concept that you're proposing, however in the current game there is one, maybe two good load out cards per character. Going off what /u/Lexi8745 said, if you have a great card but terrible perks. Is it really worthwhile playing it? (I've been guilty of playing a gold card I liked but with terrible perks)  Personally I would like to see a possible transfiguration, i.e. you can apply a Gold or Cobalt onto a load out you like.. However I also see that reducing the money SD will make as it'll stop people buying cases. It's definitely a tough one."
Dirtybomb,3d23uw,Sessions7,2,Mon Jul 13 04:46:45 2015 UTC,"What if you could re-roll the perks? It'd cost depending on the tier of the perk, and you could only do it once per card. You're guaranteed to NOT get the one you already had, but you cannot choose the one you want."
Dirtybomb,3d23uw,Lexi8745,1 point,Mon Jul 13 04:55:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah I can see that being viable, you would pay some in game Cash or real money to re-roll the perks and hope for the best. It maintains the concept of luck just like when you open cases, but you have a chance to get better perks on your nice cards. Great idea!"
Dirtybomb,3d23uw,Sessions7,1 point,Mon Jul 13 04:59:56 2015 UTC,"It's better for the game to let you farm enough credits to buy the cards you want rather than trading them.  There aren't enough loadouts combinations to justify the need of trading, just farm and get the one you want."
Dirtybomb,3cz3n5,Nalrus,51,Sun Jul 12 02:22:50 2015 UTC,"You know, we have so many pointy-gun apparatus thingies for airstrike characters, why not just keep Arty's current mortar strike (maybe buff the damage just an eentsy bit) but give him the ability to whip out a tablet with the game map and let him airstrike any spot on there?   It makes it different than both skyhammer and kira, and it gives his mortar strike a wealth of new purposes"
Dirtybomb,3cz3n5,JD_274,9,Sun Jul 12 07:05:08 2015 UTC,but give him the ability to whip out a tablet with the game map and let him airstrike any spot on there?   because with 3 of them.. i could pin down a spawn point/choke point and ruin the game. One arty after another.. keeping a team in one spot while an objective is being taken.
Dirtybomb,3cz3n5,lispychicken,4,Sun Jul 12 13:58:17 2015 UTC,"obvs spawns would be off limits, chokes can be bypassed, and the tactic has the obvious weakness of if anyone goes around via another route, the team is loaded down with 3 Artys with their noses buried in their airstrike tablets."
Dirtybomb,3cz3n5,Sianmink,3,Sun Jul 12 17:21:56 2015 UTC,Ok but 8 artys dropping bombs on an EV or bombsite continuously might be a problem. I'm not saying they couldn't balance it but I'd be worried.
Dirtybomb,3cz3n5,Hornfreak,6,Sun Jul 12 18:57:16 2015 UTC,It's it really any different than a pub full of skyhammers bombing an EV?
Dirtybomb,3cz3n5,FuzzyChops,2,Sun Jul 12 23:31:57 2015 UTC,"how about it would only be a certain area around you, and not exactly the entire map? Just so some people wouldn't be able to sit in spawn and bomb the enemies spawn."
Dirtybomb,3cz3n5,thrnee,4,Mon Jul 13 00:34:19 2015 UTC,"This idea is really cool. Could be hard to balance, though, since you could bomb spawn exits with perfect timing. Could be fixed with a sound playing or something. Either way, it's a cool alternative idea to ""just make it like in ET""."
Dirtybomb,3cz3n5,chasfrank,6,Sun Jul 12 13:05:23 2015 UTC,"Maybe do this, but give him a fixed radius relative to where he is on the map for bringing down Arty.  He can only call down an artillery strike, if its within 25m(just a number I'm throwing out there) of him."
Dirtybomb,3cz3n5,Not_Vanilla_Ice,2,Sun Jul 12 13:12:04 2015 UTC,"I'd be happy if they buffed dmg and fixed the designator so it's always telling you wether or not your place spot is valid, not just when I try to place it."
Dirtybomb,3cz3n5,pnellesen,1 point,Sun Jul 12 14:21:01 2015 UTC,"I think the cooldown would really need to be looked at for that, but yeah, I like it. Could also consider only one strike allowed in a certain time interval per team if spam is thought to be an issue."
Dirtybomb,3cz3n5,treycook,11,Sun Jul 12 22:01:29 2015 UTC,"Honestly, what gets me more than the load and deploy timers (assuming they have their reasons) is the fact that I have to wait to load and refresh my account when heading back to the lobby to open cases because you can't do them between games.  I can just imagine someone joining a game using Quickmatch (which takes a bit just to find a server, if it finds one), connecting, loading, deploying, joining into a game that has just ended, everyone drops from the server because they all want to open cases, player drops as well to find a new server... etc.  The interface really provides an overwhelming amount of ""hurry up and wait."""
Dirtybomb,3cz3n5,Callipygio,36,Sun Jul 12 05:53:16 2015 UTC,To be honest I really like your idea of removing phantom for the time being. People will bitch about it but I feel like getting him in a CTE will allow SD to work out his kinks more effectively than keeping him in game where he's actively ruining people's enjoyment. They'll have more time to work on him and they can keep him away from fucking up the game until he's balanced such that he doesn't do so.
Dirtybomb,3cz3n5,Juice-Root,28,Sun Jul 12 02:43:13 2015 UTC,"Except Nexon will NEVER let that happen. They're making profit from people buying him if they did so with real money. Profit trumps all, ESPECIALLY in F2P games. The best we can hope for is a tweak, which hopefully won't make him useless. Honestly they should just take a note out of BLR's book when it comes to melee characters."
Dirtybomb,3cz3n5,mitsuhiko,11,Sun Jul 12 04:11:50 2015 UTC,"Profit does not trump all, low churn does. If people don't like the game they will leave and the revenue drops. So the highest priority for us is to keep players happy and engaged."
Dirtybomb,3cz3n5,dejecaal,2,Sun Jul 12 11:28:09 2015 UTC,"This is an adorably honest answer.  Most F2P developers would just say ""Our priority is to make sure players enjoy the game"" and leave out the ""because players who enjoy the game will pay more for it"" bit."
Dirtybomb,3cz3n5,fashric,1 point,Sun Jul 12 16:34:24 2015 UTC,If you want the majority of your players to be happy remove Phantom until he's fixed then. Its really as simple as that.
Dirtybomb,3cz3n5,mitsuhiko,8,Sun Jul 12 12:15:47 2015 UTC,Nothing ever is as simple :)
Dirtybomb,3cz3n5,fashric,-1,Sun Jul 12 13:21:08 2015 UTC,So what's difficult about removing this particular merc? You have done it before or is it the fact you decided to actually charge money for it without actually testing it? You made this problem yourselves don't be crying about how hard it is to change it because to me it just sounds like a cop out.
Dirtybomb,3cz3n5,mitsuhiko,11,Sun Jul 12 13:36:57 2015 UTC,"It's not my call to remove anything. I can just tell you that at least currently removing something is not as easy because there are no processes in place to do that (compensation for players that bought, in game messaging, informing customer support, coming up with a long term solution, etc.)  All of that requires careful consideration. Also while you might get a certainnidea on reddit which turns into a echochamber quickly, there is a whole community out there which also plays which never shows up here.  There are people more capable than me making such decisions, but above is a small excerpt of why things are never that easy."
Dirtybomb,3cz3n5,fashric,1 point,Sun Jul 12 13:55:08 2015 UTC,"But its not only on reddit is it? It on your own forums and on the steam forums, in game chat and here then there's the guys I've played with on ts that agree that Phantom is ruining the fun of the game. We are all playing a lot less as a result. So it has nothing to do with reddit being an echo chamber its actually what people have experienced first hand and its visible anywhere there are discussions about Dirty Bomb. You have also really put yourselves in a ridiculous situation by charging money for this merc like you say refunds and such are a pia but now if you do nerf it people are going to be up in arms that its not the merc they paid for. Just the whole situation SD have created is laughable in its short sightedness."
Dirtybomb,3cz3n5,mitsuhiko,7,Sun Jul 12 14:02:44 2015 UTC,"You have also really put yourselves in a ridiculous situation by charging money for this merc like you say refunds and such are a pia but now if you do nerf it people are going to be up in arms that its not the merc they paid for.   As you mentioned, there will be unhappy players if you take something away, if you change anything but also if you introduce new characters, weapons etc.  It's tricky to make everybody happy.  Thankfully I am not in the situation where I have to make a decision about what to do with Phantom.  I just attempted to give you an insight why the problem is more complex than just doing what some people on reddit suggest.  Not that this is necessarily wrong, but it's not guaranteed to be correct.  The worst thing is to make a mistake and then to make an quick decision that turns out to be another (and maybe worse) mistake."
Dirtybomb,3cz3n5,fashric,-1,Sun Jul 12 16:42:07 2015 UTC,Well hopefully the people that do make the decisions will learn not to monetise untested and very obviously broken mercs going forward and something is done quickly about the current situation.
Dirtybomb,3cz3n5,AlbinoBunny,3,Sun Jul 12 17:18:41 2015 UTC,"I agree, most likely situation if they wanna full re-work the guy is they evelyn him.  Which was a League character whose stealth mechanics were binary and frustrating to play against (seeing a trend) so they nerfed her into being garbage until such a time they found a way to make her stealth semi-workable in the context of  a MOBA.  What I'm saying is nuke Phantom into the ground till he can be an entertaining part of the game for both the people playing him and the people playing against him."
Dirtybomb,3cz3n5,dejecaal,2,Sun Jul 12 08:36:51 2015 UTC,"Phantom's stealth mechanics aren't ""binary"". Evelynn was called binary because she was either completely impossible to see, or just as easy to see as any other character. Phantom's stealth mechanics can be spotted if you have a keen eye or ear."
Dirtybomb,3cz3n5,AlbinoBunny,1 point,Sun Jul 12 16:31:41 2015 UTC,"So you either see him and he's pointless (well, not right now because lol 75 damage shield with a shield gate) or you don't see him and he likely one or two shots you.  That's plenty binary.  Eve was the same way, if you had detection she was garbage, if you didn't she could run over your team."
Dirtybomb,3cz3n5,dejecaal,4,Sun Jul 12 16:40:01 2015 UTC,"By that logic everything is binary. You either get killed by the airstrike or you don't. You either 1v1 kill the Rhino in melee range or you don't. Medics either revive you or they don't.  Phantom's ""invisibility"" is like a skill check. It can always be spotted if you're observant, but if you're not paying attention he can slip by you. To make the Evelynn analogy valid, Phantom would have to be truly invisible and only spottable through Vasili heartbeat sensors or the upcoming merc's infrared sight thing.  Even if you don't see him coming a mile away, more often than not I can spot Phantoms when they close in for the melee kill. Assuming I'm playing a merc with over 110HP (like I generally do, and always have) I have a plenty of time to put him to the ground.  The best strategy seems to be a longjump away from him followed by headshots as he moves towards you to close the gap. This often works even if he already hit you once because you don't get oneshotted by his rightclick and he's stuck in a quite lengthy animation after it."
Dirtybomb,3cz3n5,AlbinoBunny,2,Sun Jul 12 16:57:07 2015 UTC,"No, it's always binary because it's either giving it's full effect or it's completely useless.  The airstrike can hit you at the edges for non-fatal damage or can zone you.  The phantom is either seen or unseen. With massive advantages for when he's unseen that frustrate players and being pretty bad when he's not cloaked.  There's a reason in TF2 (probably the best example of a stealth class in FPS's) can't attack out of cloak instantly and actually mostly relies on something which isn't a check for 20/20 vision to get by people in the form of his disguise.  Also all your comments seem to be from the point of view that he's not just KEK ambushing you. At which point his health pool and the power of that gun will work just fine against a Fragger or other beefy merc. Long jump or no."
Dirtybomb,3cz3n5,JustiniZHere,-4,Sun Jul 12 18:10:32 2015 UTC,"till he can be an entertaining part of the game for both the people playing him and the people playing against him.   The issue here is people will never like Phantom, the game went too long without him so people got use to being able to wonder off on their own with no repercussions, Phantom is now that repercussion and people hate it.  I can balance Phantom right now, don't go off on your own, all 5 of you don't huddle in a corner together, Phantom is now useless.   What I'm saying is nuke Phantom into the ground   That also is a sure fire way to make people who spent money on Phantom quit the game, Riot who you used as an example use to be the kings of this, release a completely unbalanced champion so people buy it day 1 only to nerf it into the ground later after the sales had fallen off.  Now if they removed Phantom and gave everyone their credits / money they spent on him back, sure whatever. They can rebalance him until the end of time then."
Dirtybomb,3cz3n5,t0k3n98,3,Sun Jul 12 09:03:19 2015 UTC,"The problem isn't that all 5 of you huddle in the corner the problem is this is a game with fronts. You are heading through a linear level with clear lines drawn of your side and their side at any given time.   The problem is all on phantom and how this game is designed it's designed to be frantic and faced paced and if you're focusing on pushing your objective and firing back at the enemy in front of you, you shouldn't have to worry about the guy who is designed to sneak behind you it's literally at odds with what the game wants to be."
Dirtybomb,3cz3n5,JustiniZHere,2,Sun Jul 12 12:19:32 2015 UTC,it's literally at odds with what the game wants to be.   Clearly if SD released Phantom that is not how the game wants to be.
Dirtybomb,3cz3n5,t0k3n98,4,Sun Jul 12 12:32:27 2015 UTC,I mean RIOT released plenty of champs that got full reworks because they were at odds with the flow of the game.   Valve sent out an update that made the AUG in CS a laser rifle and quickly fixed it because it was at odds with gameplay.   Turns out companies make mistake all the time so I wouldn't say it's clear that's how they want the game to be.
Dirtybomb,3cz3n5,AlbinoBunny,2,Sun Jul 12 12:46:18 2015 UTC,"I feel like simultaneously threatening reduced popularity in a game while also saying 'Riot did this a bunch' is probably contradictory.  Also nah, there are plenty of characters that are good 1v1 duelists but also have counter play involved so that they're entertaining to fight and aren't basically 'oh you just got shank'd/KEK'd from a random place'. The game's added other characters before without this level of up-roar and it's because the previously added characters were still fun regardless of your opinion of their balance."
Dirtybomb,3cz3n5,SquirmyBurrito,4,Sun Jul 12 12:01:24 2015 UTC,"The reason why this level of up-roar wasn't present is that phantom punishes certain actions that players had gotten used to not having to worry about. He is the character that punishes lone wolf players and groups that don't watch their flank. Just as Rhino punished those who were stupid enough to continuously funnel down a hallway he was filling with lead. Just as Fragger/Nader punishes those who group together and hide in corners. Kill-orientated mercs are going to piss people off.   My issue with Phantom is that he is both too easy and too hard to counter. Good players can counter him by simply keeping an eye/ear out for his cloak tells. Bad players can't counter him because they aren't used to having to do any of that/because they get distracted by all the other enemies trying to kill them/because they get tunnel vision.  I do not agree with the removal of this character as it goes against the entire reason SD released him in the first place. This is game is in beta, it is our job to test the game. Playing/playing against Phantom is an important part of that job. Removing him when the stab wounds are still fresh and the playerbase is forming a huge circlejerk isn't going to fix anything. Remember, SD thought Phantom was fine when they released him.  Honestly, I do not believe there is a reasonable way to fix him that doesn't either retain his pubstomper status or completely remove any chance at him being viable in competitive."

No the reason people are in an uproar about this guy is because he slows down the flow of the game in a way you can't really help because of the pace of the game. If a sky hammer or proxy flank you, it's on you and your team because they are clearly visible. But phantom is a blur and between explosions gun fights and pushing objectives it's unreasonable to expect someone to also keep an eye out for a blur.    My issue with Phantom is that he is both too easy and too hard to counter. Good players can counter him by simply keeping an eye/ear out for his cloak tells. Bad players can't counter him because they aren't used to having to do any of that/because they get distracted by all the other enemies trying to kill them/because they get tunnel vision    This is ridiculous there is only so much the average human brain can focus on, and if you can focus on slaying planting/protecting the objective and have all the time to look for a blur good on you. But just know if he isn't changed you will be paying with you and 3 others because not even pro cs players can be that aware and that game is way slower.

Yes and no, they will be releasing champions outside of beta so testing him at this moment when there are way more pressing issues with memory leaks, fps troubles, a horrid ui, and the awful aimpunch he isn't all that important especially when just on paper alone he was just broken."
Dirtybomb,3cz3n5,SquirmyBurrito,3,Sun Jul 12 15:15:34 2015 UTC,"He slows down the flow of the game no more than Proxy's mines, Nader's nades, Skyhammer's airstrike, Kira's lazer, Vas' instagibs, or Rhino's presence. I'd actually go so far as to say he speeds things up most of the time since he lends himself to an incredibly aggressive playstyle. He is incredibly easy to spot if you know what to look for. I haven't had to slow down to compensate for his addition at all.  Sure, but his presence isn't suddenly putting us over the limit on what we can focus on. Planting only requires you to hold one key down, during that time you can use your eyes to watch out for him or other enemies. Defending should include looking out for him. Stop trying to separate watching for him and standard defending, they are the same thing. It takes no extra time to use your eyes. If you are keeping an eye out for him, you will see standard enemies just fine, no extra time needed. Nice exaggeration, unfortunately for you more advanced players typically have no trouble spotting and killing him. That is why he isn't nearly as potent in min 10 servers and that is why he isn't going to suddenly stomp in comp. He punishes the lazy. Pro CS players are even MORE aware than what is needed to watch for a Phantom.  He is a merc that was removed because he was hard to balance. He was rereleased and SD has said they are trying to gather data from the live playtesting so they can use that to further balance him. Fixing the UI, aimpunch, memory leaks, and fps troubles are all things us players have little to do with. Testing phantom is something we play a huge role in. There is absolutely no reason why it can't be done at the same time as other issues. Phantom was going to be released at some point. It makes more sense to release him now, and get player feedback (taken with a fucking ton of salt considering the circlejerk and misinformation) than to wait and release him later in the same ""broken"" state.   On paper, he is fine. He's a merc with average speed and health, with a cloak that makes him harder to see (but not invisible), a better than average melee weapon on one third of his loadouts, a better than average primary on one third of his loadouts, and a damage shield that's HP is directly tied to his cloak's duration. He oneshots practically the same people the stiletto was oneshotting pre-phantom update. He isn't nearly as broken as people are making him out to be. He's a kill-orientated merc that does really well against players that lack situational awareness and does really bad against players who have it."

Dirtybomb,3cz3n5,Wimperator,-3,Sun Jul 12 09:34:09 2015 UTC,"I would quit the game forever if they just remove Phantom, because people are whining. Also remove Skyhammer, Vassili, Sparks and Fragger please. I dont like getting killed by them."
Dirtybomb,3cz3n5,-Zoner,7,Sun Jul 12 07:45:44 2015 UTC,"Now for Phantom. My suggestion is simple. Take him out of the game for the time being. Issue refunds, give people the option to cash their cards in or not, whatever. If you need more time to balance him, don’t make us sit with him. It’s not ok to release a merc that kills the spirit and intent of the game and then say “Hey, he’s broken, we know, hang in there.”    Funny, other day I played a game where the enemy was screaming about phantom killing 1 player in spawn (chapel) they killed the guy. When they came out to fight for the EV space, 4 of them got wiped by a single Skyhammer strike, 2 by a fragger nade I got the rest on the stairs with a sticky trap.   No one said anything."
Dirtybomb,3cz3n5,ProbablyInfinite,2,Sun Jul 12 13:16:05 2015 UTC,"Well you have to consider how much potential counterplay there was in getting the kill.  Skyhammer's airstrike has an indicator and can only be used in open air; Fragger's nades are pretty strong, but can be avoided and he can only carry 2 at a time; Proxy's mines can be destroyed/relocated and have an audio indicator when its about to blow. Getting kills from those and avoiding kills from those give a sense of satisfaction, either as ""I caught them all bunched up behind the EV"" or ""I just got out in time before the mine blew"". Phantom on the other hand is frustrating to play against. Sure his cloak has a sound and can be seen, and smart players can spot the Phantom when he flanks, but on top of the cloak making him tankier, he also has a great gun and strong melee, making outdueling him very hard even if you spot him. Additionally, pubs are often disorganised with poor communication, letting Phantoms get away with feeding off weaker players."
Dirtybomb,3cz3n5,-Zoner,1 point,Sun Jul 12 13:35:27 2015 UTC,"Fragger's nades are pretty strong, but can be avoided and he can only carry 2 at a time   Cooked and well aimed  Frags are not avoidable really. Anything less, is. They have a big range, and big blast area. I have gotten multiple 4 kills with one before, not even in a position under threat, sure you have too. That is hugely powerful and two perfect frags can potentially wipe a whole team re spawning, no chance of phantom doing that..   Skyhammer's airstrike has an indicator and can only be used in open air;   They do of course, but often under crossfire you have limited options to move. Also when it comes to fixing a EV, there is usually not a lot of movement options. The only cover you often have, as a engy is that EV.   Phantom on the other hand is frustrating to play against. Sure his cloak has a sound and can be seen, and smart players can spot the Phantom when he flanks,   Frustrating for some, yeah. I personally do not find him that frustrating to play against. I have played TF2 and PS2 last years, and you always have the threat of what cannot be seen easily, if you are used to that threat potential Phantom is just the same mechanic. For those not used to that mechanic, I can appreciate he must be really frustrating but that will not last.  I have phantom, first few days he was hilarious as it appears everyone had forgot, or is not used to that cloaking mechanic. Now it is not the same, people are looking, aware and know how he plays. He is not the threat he once was, already that has changed a given a little time people on the whole will not the same opinion as know I think.  Also you should be looking at that alternative route, or flank as really he can only flank. If he does not, he is not really a huge threat to a area, like fragger, nader, hammer, etc. These can take, and hold what they take.   he also has a great gun and strong melee   Kek is OK, very good. However I would not place it able the other powerhouse weapons usually around, M4 in particular, Crotz, etc. It is not really better than these, nothing special. We all have strong melee, OK we don't have the range of the katana, but it is there in the game. Does not chopper give other classes a similar strength in this area to other classes.   making outdueling him very hard even if you spot him.   Sure he has not psyched you and many out...I don't have that issue as fletcher just sticky and shotgun blast. Sticky limiting his movement usually. I would rather take that duel than with a fragger, or nader which can limit my movement options. Phantom can only run at you to melee you, or ADAD shoot you just like any class. Of course, he can slice you up from behind, but any class can if you had not seen them there.    letting Phantoms get away with feeding off weaker players.   All classes can, and will do this it is not a phantom specific trait."
Dirtybomb,3cz3n5,JustiniZHere,4,Sun Jul 12 15:28:22 2015 UTC,"This is what I don't get about the whole Phantom argument, people are saying he isn't fun to fight when that is completely subjective, I quite enjoy fighting a Phantom, it keeps you watching your back and sticking together.  Every Merc in DB is not fun to fight in some way or another, attacking on chapel is awful because skyhammer spam, attacking on bridge is awful because potential Nader spam locking off a whole entrance route. I can't stand being insta gibbed by a good Vaseline but I'd never demand he be removed from the game, that is ludicrous.  Also again I like how you are getting downvoted for completely valid points, I swear this sub is inhabited by 13 year olds now."
Dirtybomb,3cz3n5,iForkyou,6,Sun Jul 12 09:06:55 2015 UTC,"OP is being upvoted here because he feeds into the hivemind mentality right now, nothing he talks about here is new. Arty is untertuned, check. People dont want to wait long for the next game? check. Open loadouts in the lobby? check. Phantom is broken and needs to be removed? check. He just gathered up everything that has been upvoted in this sub, tagged on that he has played this game a lot and feeds it to the hivemind again. Fishing for upvotes by embracing the circlejerk. /u/wimperator just disagrees with the hivemind, thats why he is being downvoted, even if he is completly right. How can they demand  that a merc people bought and enjoy playing to be completly removed just because it slightly lowers their enjoyment of the game. It is insanely selfish and exceptionally shortsighted.   It is mostly people hovering around lvl 5-9 that are bitching about phantom right now. He is overtuned against inexperienced players, a typical pubstomp merc. It becomes way better on lvl 10+ servers, since people realise that phantom offers very little in terms of actually breaking a defensive position in comparison to other pure combat mercs like nader or fragger or vasili.  He excels against uncoordinated defenses, but has a very hard time doing his job against a better and more aware team, even if played well. The outrage against phantom and the developer is pretty disgusting if you ask me, I am a dota 1 veteran since the very first versions and people here are just mirroring the criticisms Icefrog had to endure when he took over the game and the balancing. He always had a very patient approach to balancing, leaving champions that where considered overpowered by many people in the the community unchanged for weeks because people oftentimes figured out a solution to deal with him and it often turned out that they where way less overpowered than players thought at the beginning. It did lead to a more healthy game design, because he considered his playerbase to be intelligent and being able to figure new champions out, instead of listening to the very vocal crybabies."
Dirtybomb,3cz3n5,RobReynalds,2,Sun Jul 12 11:46:53 2015 UTC,"So wait.. the merc 'excells against uncoordinated defenses' but is outclassed when playing against experienced players is a good design?  The merc is the definition of anti-fun. You don't want to deal with him and you dont want him on your team. He doesn't fit in 5v5(competitive) and he brings nothing but meh to more populated matches. This is by the way, before 2 of his supposed class counters are even in the game. Bad idea. The only thing allowing this to continue is ego and/or money."
Dirtybomb,3cz3n5,dejecaal,3,Sun Jul 12 14:11:52 2015 UTC,"He didn't say it was good design, he just said that he's not overpowered. Because he isn't.  The game is still in beta, so it's conceivable that they added Phantom in purely to get feedback on how to balance him. While adding him in after the two ""counter"" mercs to him might seem like a good idea, it's possible that they specifically wanted to see how he would play out with these mercs out of the picture."

My favorite example is Rhino, hes a slow moving bullet sponge with a Minigun in an otherwise usually fast paced game where you have a chance to win a duel against anyone with the right aim. But as soon as a Rhino is on the other team there is no way you can just 1v1 duel you have to play around it. That's how I feel about Phantom."

I have to agree with you on the spam though but that is a problem with their business model and how they will deal with the amount of same mercs per game."
Dirtybomb,3cz3n5,Kyzriel,0,Sun Jul 12 12:25:16 2015 UTC,"The game is in Open Beta.  By playing the game in this stage, we basically say ""Hey, we want to be guinea pigs!""... We are their testing environment.  And honestly, the tweak to Phantom without breaking him would be... a little complex to code.  At least my idea for it is.  My idea is to tweak his Refractive Armor as follows: * Can only absorb one or two bodyshots, with bleed-through. * Bleed-through changes depending on energy left. * Headshots have a base 50% damage bleed-through. * 50% Energy left or less means headshots will do full damage. * The armor can only absorb a max of 30% of an explosion. * If a hit is received (has to be a player, not fall damage), the cloak will go into a 20-30 second cooldown.    Also, even in Phantom's current state, Vassili is technically a direct counter to Phantom due to his heartbeat sensor, and a good Vassili player will also ruin a Phantom's day.  The reason I wouldn't completely remove the shielding mechanic from the cloak is due to the fact that it's refractive armor, not some special cloaking device that uses radiation or something.  Getting hit by a bullet or two should drain the remainder of his armor's power source, and it should be useless until it's fully recharged, similar to how Sparks' REVIVR Gun works if you overload it.  Phantom does need tweaking, as with most new releases in every game ever, but he's not this god Merc everyone makes him out to be."
Dirtybomb,3cz3n5,pisshead_,2,Sun Jul 12 21:55:03 2015 UTC,I don't think you can use the 'it's a beta' excuse when you're charging money for OP characters.
Dirtybomb,3cz3n5,SquirmyBurrito,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:53:44 2015 UTC,"The game is in beta regardless of whether or not they monetize something. In fact, for a f2p game it makes more sense to get your monetization system out early so you can see what prices players are okay with, and what items players are okay with being able to buy. That and it helps keep you afloat since keeping all those servers up and running can't be cheap."
Dirtybomb,3cz3n5,Callipygio,0,Mon Jul 13 14:20:08 2015 UTC,"I agree.   If you're gonna use your beta as a testing ground a la Killing Floor 2, that's fine and it'll be an effective way to test your game's system and character implementation.   However, when you're charging money for characters and features, this becomes inherently more difficult, as any changes that may be necessary for the purpose of balancing an eventually finished game could serve to piss people off who've paid money. So now the devs are not only having to worry about balancing their beta-stage game, they're also trying to keep customers happy so they'll continue spending money. I'm not saying the system is wrong - they need to do it this way since it's a free to play game and they want revenue - but I'm trying to prove a point as to why saying ""it's a beta"" isn't a fair thing to say in this game's case."

But I think a lot of people bought him with real money and getting refunded with credits might not be the right way.

Jesus Christ, who thought a tanky stealth would be a good idea?  He needs to be a glass cannon.  That's how ninjas work.  Their stealth is their armor.  Also, limit the amount of time stealth can be active at once.  If Phantom had to pick and choose his moment to go stealth, he'd be much easier to pick off before he became a problem.  I think stealth should be good for picking off snipers and clearing enclosed rooms.  There is NO reason someone should just be able to stealth around the whole map so he can get behind the entire enemy team in an open area and take them all out.  That's bad design.

As it stands it is just too easy for good players to spot you for him to be made into a glass cannon. Getting a couple seconds to kill them only helps if you can actually get to them. All they have to do is jump away/backpedal and blast you in the face with their remburg. He doesn't just have similar health to bushwhacker, he is also as slow as him too."
Dirtybomb,3cz3n5,carnivoris,3,Sun Jul 12 14:07:20 2015 UTC,"I could see adding some speed or maybe an extra sprint ability to him being beneficial... but only if his health were lowered.  Assassins/ninjas are ALWAYS low health characters.  They're strategic characters that can decimate if played properly, but require high-skill to use properly... usually.  Dirty Bomb's implementation is too easy to play and that makes playing against him frustrating and, really, imbalanced.  Lower health, give him a sprint or some sort of escape mechanism, increase stealth cooldown, limit stealth duration... I say that's how you at least begin to balance Phantom.  I think he's invisible enough, tbh.  Sure, he's easily seen out in the open when stealthed but I think that's part of the issue.  No ninja will stealth out in the open.  In close quarters, his stealth will give him enough of a buffer to get melee kills.  That's all it should be."
Dirtybomb,3cz3n5,SquirmyBurrito,0,Sun Jul 12 14:31:44 2015 UTC,"Someone is going to have to explain to me why other games/movies/books/etc doing things one way means everyone has to do it that way. Assassins in many games are low health characters, cool, that doesn't mean Dirty Bomb can't shake things up by having an average speed, average health assassin instead.   He is too easy to play when playing against lower skill players. In min 10 servers that ceases to be the case. I'm not saying anyone who complains about him is a scrub, I'm just saying that those who complain are likely not paying as much attention to their surroundings as they should. Even when standing still he is visible.  Lower his health so he is more reliant on his stealth, make him faster so he can keep up with other squishies (thus making him even stronger against those characters), and then proceed to nerf the stealth you just got done making him more reliant on? What? Your method of balance seems to be 'Nerf what I don't like into the ground, and then go from there', and that is by far one of the most frustrating (for players) way to approach balancing. Invisible enough? He's easy to see if you know what to look for. That isn't invisible enough when you make him a glass cannon. If he is easily seen in any situation (barring hard counters like red eye) there is something wrong. Why shouldn't he be able to stealth out in the open? All the maps feature wide open spaces that the main battles take place in. In close quarters his stealth is even less useful since he is easier to spot there."
Dirtybomb,3cz3n5,carnivoris,4,Sun Jul 12 14:59:17 2015 UTC,You know why other games make assassins like that?  Because it's balanced.  It just sounds like you're a DB fanboy and you don't know what the fuck you're talking about.  There's clearly an issue with Phantom balance and I do believe what I've suggested would go a long way towards fixing it.  How would YOU suggest it be fixed?
Dirtybomb,3cz3n5,SquirmyBurrito,0,Sun Jul 12 15:13:14 2015 UTC,"I'm a fanboy of no game. It is one way to balance it, it isn't the only way. The issue with phantom is minor IMO. My suggestion for fixing him would be one of two things.  A)  -Low health (maybe 90 or so, enough that he isn't oneshotted by the remburg to the body). -Movement speed buffed. -Chopper removed, but katana gets a 20% melee damage buff when attacking an enemy from behind. -Damage shield and damage gate kept, but damage shield's 'HP' reduced somewhat. -Duration stays the same. -Kek removed from arsenal loadouts. -cloak made 'more invisible'.  or  B) -Same health, same speed. -Chopper removed, katana damage left as is. -All other melee weapons in his loadouts are replaced with the katana. -Damage shield hp reduced by X, damage gate completely removed  (so damage bleeds over). -Kek is kept."
Dirtybomb,3cz3n5,carnivoris,2,Sun Jul 12 15:39:13 2015 UTC,"So if you're admitting my way is one possible valid way, then why are you arguing with me?"
Dirtybomb,3cz3n5,SquirmyBurrito,1 point,Sun Jul 12 16:37:04 2015 UTC,"No, I didn't. If you were to compare my suggestions side-by-side with yours you'd realize there were some major differences. One of the major ones being that I opted to keep his ability strong while balancing his damage output and health instead. If he get's to keep his average health, he keeps his shield to, but damage bleeds over. If he loses his health, he keeps the gate to prevent him getting absolutely wrecked before he can even get into his range. I also chose to balance his loadouts (since I have only seen one Phantom using a loadout that that wasn't his chopper+katana+kek loadout) and fix an issue I had with him (why is the katana merc not guaranteed to have his katana?). I chose to reward stealth, but not punish players for opting to not use it (or stumbling into a heartbeat sensor). Your suggestion would see him made more reliant on his stealth, while also nerfing his stealth. I chose to (on option A) make him more reliant on it, but without nerfing it. In fact, I opted to buff it.   You sought to nerf Phantom, I sought to balance him. That is the difference between us, that is why I argued with you, and that is why I do not consider your suggestion a valid option."
Dirtybomb,3cz3n5,Gas0line,3,Mon Jul 13 01:45:31 2015 UTC,"How is Phantom a glass cannon? Those 80/90 health mercs with shotguns are glass cannons. Phantom combines their CQC prowess with a much lower skill requirement, very good ranged options and twice the survivability."
Dirtybomb,3cz3n5,SquirmyBurrito,0,Sun Jul 12 16:07:45 2015 UTC,"Pay attention to context. I was referring to that person's suggestion that he be turned into a glass  cannon. How does running up to someone at high speed and shotgunning them in the face require more skill than sneaking up on them/running up to them at average speed and meleeing them once or twice before they kill you? He doesn't have twice their survivability unless he is cloaked  (in which case, he can't attack without losing that survivability ). I'm on mobile so forgive me if any of this is hard to understand.  Edit: Added a bit more clarity."
Dirtybomb,3cz3n5,Gas0line,2,Sun Jul 12 16:29:13 2015 UTC,"Sorry, must have misread then.  As for skill, shotguns require aim, whereas the Katana has a huge margin for error. The approach to your target is more or less the same, except Phantom can tank a bunch of headshots. And compared to most other mercs, his healthpool is large, even without the bullshit shield."
Dirtybomb,3cz3n5,SquirmyBurrito,0,Sun Jul 12 16:33:29 2015 UTC,"Shotguns require only slightly more aim than a katana, and they reward getting close enough that you no longer have to bother with aim. The katana requires that you connect the dots (your katana's blade with their body). Not a whole lot of difference in the margin of skillful aiming needed. Up close, your opponent also appears to be moving 'faster' relative to your aim than they would at longer distances where much smaller movements are needed to correct your aim. The katana also requires that you move your body along with your aim, whereas the shotgun doesn't technically require you to move (beyond the typical dodging of bullets) your body once you have reached your in range. It is also harder for your opponent to get out of range of your shotgun before you shoot them than it is for a player to simply long-jump out of your katana's range. Phantom can tank very few headshots without his shield. Compared to most other mercs? What? Have you even bothered to look at his stats? He only has 120 health. That is just ten more than bushwhacker. 10! Four of the fourteen mercs in this game have 120+ health not counting Phantom. Of the ten left, four have just ten less health than Phantom, 110. Of the six left one has 100 health, just twenty less than Phantom. The five remaining mercs are: Kira and Proxy at 90, Aura and Sparks at 80, and then Phantom at 120. So here's how I see it: A) You seem to think four-five mercs counts as 'most other mercs' (5 out of fourteen mercs). B) You think that 120 health is 'large' when compared to 110 health (9 out of fourteen). C) You didn't even bother to look at all the different mercs' stats and just pulled that assumption out of thin air.  Assuming I didn't flub simple math, the average health of a merc in this game is 113.blahblahblah (I'm just going to round down). Phantom has 120 health. While larger than average, 120 is not so much more that I would consider it large in-comparison. At most that means a difference of one extra bullet, in practice, it probably will not lead to a noticeable increase in TTK when uncloaked and compared to other mercs.  TL;DR- His health pool is only marginally larger than the average, and he won't be tanking ""a bunch of headshots"". As far as headshots go, the lowest damage weapon (per bullet) that I saw on the wiki was the Tolen MP. A merc at 120 health would take 7 (rounded up from 6.6-bunch-of-sixes-7) headshots to kill, while a merc at 110 health would also take 7 (rounded up from 6.-bunch-of-ones) headshots to kill at the very least."
Dirtybomb,3cz3n5,pisshead_,2,Mon Jul 13 02:16:40 2015 UTC,"How is a glass cannon going to work when his big thing, his katana, requires him to get to melee range where other squishy characters are wielding fucking shotguns?   Use stealth to flank opponents (not hard on most areas considering the huge amount of empty space on the maps), then kill him. A stealth character in any game should be in deep shit when exposed, but with Phantom they just kill you anyway because they have no weaknesses."
Dirtybomb,3cz3n5,SquirmyBurrito,0,Mon Jul 13 00:18:44 2015 UTC,"That only works when your opponents aren't paying attention. As soon as they start paying attention, that tactic's success rate sharply decreases. Phantom is a kill-orientated merc that isn't capable of killing while invisible. Because of this he shouldn't have to rely on his cloak to get all of his kills. IMO, he should be capable of killing while not cloaked, but at a decreased effectiveness. This is already the case as a phantom that isn't cloaked, is just a SMG/Heavy Pistol/Melee toting guy with average health and speed. After he get's his first kill (assuming his first attack is a guaranteed kill) he loses the advantage he had and the playing field levels out. To claim phantom has no weakness is to turn a blind eye to the fact that his cloak and shield cease to protect him once he attacks. Is a kek wielding, pre-patch stiletto toting Bushwhacker without weakness (his C82 Adept Operative loadout has the kek and the stiletto, pre-patch the stilleto did around 90 damage, only slightly less than the katana IIRC)? No? Then why is an uncloaked Phantom considered (by you) to be without weakness? Is it because you're ignoring this single, incredibly important piece of information? Or am I to be lead to believe that that ten extra health Phantom is sporting is making all the difference and completely eliminating his weaknesses?"
Dirtybomb,3cz3n5,kirenasura,5,Mon Jul 13 01:38:49 2015 UTC,"Going to talk more about Arty and Phantom here:  Arty needs a rework on his ability. Your suggestion is very interesting- motion-sensing. Do you mind fleshing that out more? It somehow seems very hard to be useful, since most mercs could just longjump past a spot where ""motion sensing"" is in place, and can completely dodge an airstrike.  I personally think Arty just needs to be more effective than Skyhammer at destroying the EV. He has a decent arsenal of weapons, but overall he doesn't outshine anyone. I think that if we kept the same concept of him having low CDs yet effective airstrikes, he could become a monster if the numbers on the abilities are correct. The damage is obviously the worst part of his ability, but that could be changed by adding more mortar shells dropping at a faster rate. Maybe the designator is what really needs a change? I personally find that a laser is very ineffective because you need to show yourself to use the ability.  Now Phantom: He's not nearly as broken as people claim. The only gripe that I have with him is that he's too versatile against new players, and somewhat frustrating for the vets. I have experienced worse before- IE Aura's healing station could heal a whole team so fast, that it was a camp fest around every corner, but I think I can address what the problem with his kit is.  Phantom's Katana (which might move to other mercs soon) really needs a hitbox change. The swinging momentum lasts for a second or two, making it extremely forgiving if you miss your enemy. Therefore, in order to make Phantom a little more skillful to use, the animation needs to be fixed so that the user has to actually be careful of leaving his cloak & shield. The katana should be kept in the game as well, because without it Phantom CANNOT kill medics and objective specialists quickly. Isn't he supposed to be an Assassin?  His cloaking needs a longer cooldown in-between downtimes. As of right now, I see many Phantoms staying invisible for the longest time; crouching in corners and waiting for the enemy Aura to come so he can use his heavy attack to slay her. This is a problem for newer and somewhat seasoned players, because they haven't developed gamesense yet. They won't know that the exact spot they were in was the most opportune time for a Phantom to strike, and that's probably what is frustrating about Phantom. You have to pay attention to everything, which is a chore even for me.  And lastly, Phantom's cloak also has an effect that people don't know about. Scenario: Phantom just activated his cloak and an enemy Fragger notices, so he uses his cooked grenade to kill him. Presuming the grenade does maybe 80(?) damage, and Phantom's cloak has 75 effective absorption whatever, the explosion will take out the cloak, but it WILL NOT ""bleed over"" into Phantom's health. This also applies when Phantom's cloak only has 1 effective absorption whatever- he will still tank the grenade. This means that the cloak can pretty much tank every big damage, even if it goes into negative values, and Phantom's real health will remain untouched. Therefore, I believe that a ""bleeding over"" mechanic should fix the tanking issue right now. And I also think that Phantom shouldn't have any health regen while in cloak, as well as be able to pick up any medpacks, because that's bullshit.  That's my two cents with the current state of the game. Hopefully some people got some new information out of this rant- thanks for reading."
Dirtybomb,3cz3n5,Mustarde,2,Sun Jul 12 11:05:53 2015 UTC,Now for Phantom. My suggestion is simple. Take him out of the game for the time being.    That's where you earned my upvote
Dirtybomb,3cz3n5,audle,4,Sun Jul 12 17:23:17 2015 UTC,Allow bullets to go through Phantoms shield and take the Kek away from him and he is fine imo.  Taking him out of the game won't balance him. He needs to be played and played by a lot of people. The entire point of beta is fixing bugs and fine tuning the game.
Dirtybomb,3cz3n5,pisshead_,2,Sun Jul 12 07:39:40 2015 UTC,Also reduce his shield and make his melee less powerful.

Dirtybomb,3cz3n5,kirenasura,15,Sun Jul 12 03:00:49 2015 UTC,"When you're in a rush, expect mines. Mines always kill you when you're in a rush. usually if you get around them it can make the difference in a game.   That being said, buy proxy. She's fun and she has mines, which get loads of kills and make a difference in a game.  Never buy cases, save your money for crafting loadouts and buying new mercs. When buying mercs research them before purchase. The last thing you want to do is buy a merc that you hate.   Never battle a merc in their perfect element ( Don't try to take on Rhino in a small hallway with Proxy ) it just won't help your team.  using a mic helps everybody and more often than not if you bitch at people to do a certain objective a certain way it will get done better and faster.   if you have health or ammo to drop, fucking drop it like it's burning you. Nobody likes the guy who sits with all of his  healthpacks regened. Always have at least one supply pack on cooldown. ( If you're Nader, keep a grenade regening. You never know what forcing yourself to spend a grenade on will get you. )  Read the reddit daily. You'll get a lot of tips and more importantly notice of free shit being given away.   On underground always try to attack first. On bridge, always try to defend first. On railroad taking the back route for the last objective ( around the left and in front of their spawn ) will often get you a free uncontested cap if you do it soon enough.   Always have an engineer in your squad for a quick defuse and never leave home without a coutner for Rhino. ( Personally nader is my fav. )   When you're not a medic, reviving other people gets you killed more often than not. When in doubt, leave them on the floor.   The two most importants things I can tell you is this. #1 aim for the head. Most people aim for the body, and that's why you'll lose fire fights. #2 Don't be frustrated, have fun. It's a game so if you're not having fun take a break and have fun. Type in lobbies, shit talk other peope ( in a fun way, think up new creative and absurd insults like 'If your dad was any hotter he'd be on fire, and then at least you'd know why he abandoned you. )   Make friends and get those friends in your lobby.

His artillery can very quickly dispatch people or disrupt positions. For instance, if there's an enemy Aura with a station set up, a quick salvo is an excellent way to destroy it. If there's a sniper on a balcony, you can aim above the balcony while still in cover and you'll be able to strike them. Unlike Skyhammer or Kira, it doesn't have a lengthy cooldown, so it's perfect for striking smaller targets.  I will admit however that the actual designator itself is quite clunky. I also think that it's a really bad idea when some maps make an ability almost entirely useless. I think this will become more apparent when Stoker is released, because his Molotov Grenades work anywhere."

For some time now (in many communities, not necessarily related to gaming) there's a trend of making tutorial/info sharing videos that are way too long considering how little info they provide.  In this example, you can really fit all the info about Thunder in a few lines of text that you read in less then a minute. You made a 4 minute video about it. It's just unoptimal, so to speak. Not that long ago all similiar content would get slapped onto some forum post to be shared with others, and it would take far less time to consume such information.

I stay far away from YT tutorials/guides and such for the reasons I stated above, but I understand that a demographic for such way of delivering information has formed.  And how I'd like it to be? Cut the gameplay and only show Thunder footage from the CBT (tho not sure if that's not breaking the old NDA), make it a two minute vid instead of four."

Try repeating that vs higher level players who actually are not blind and braindead, and can actually see phantom (he is not invisible when he walks, and if ur not blind he is easy to spot). Laughed my ass off at one point of the video where you were behind rhino slashing him he didnt even turn around (new player obviously), you shouted 'look at this i solod rhino' lol no shit sherlock you might aswell jump on his head to his death and this dude wouldnt notice, good luck soloing shitty rhino from behind."

Dirtybomb,3cxsvo,AwSunnyDeeFYeah,41,Sat Jul 11 19:08:28 2015 UTC,"Totally agree with this post.    For reference, I used to play Quake I/III pretty intensely back in the day, and I've always disliked more recent games where there are weapons/classes which just make it impossible for anyone other than utterly hardcore players to compete.  Dirty Bomb was, until a couple of days ago, the first time I've truly enjoyed an online multiplayer game in ages.  Along similar lines to your post, I just posted this over on the DB forums in response to someone urging people not to quit playing because of Phantom:   I think you are underestimating how much of an impact this has on certain classes of player.  E.g. I like to play a mix of support (Kira) and fast/light (Proxy) merc. Both of these in their different ways are completely ruined by Phantom. Kira, and Archie, and also Skyhammer if you have a semi-auto gun, thrive on engaging at medium to long range using precision fire to go for headshots. However, the guns in question do not by and large have scopes on them. So being able to actually see opponents, even just the faintest glimpse of them, is critical to actually being able to play.  Now with Phantom, this type of engagement is virtually impossible. He is, contrary to what people here claim, functionally invisible at range in any kind of active battlefield.  Once he gets close up, it's too late. E.g. with Kira, your absolute best case is nailing 2-3 body shots on him in close quarters with the semi-auto. This will not take him down. It is pretty well impossible to realise he is there, turn, locate him, nail 3+ headshots (which is required to overcome the magic armour) and still keep him out of magical katana range.  So while he is there, Kira is unplayable.  Then take Proxy. I play her with the SMG, which is a handy little weapon capable of doing moderate damage at moderate range, and capable of accurately producing headshots. But it has a relatively small magazine. And to take down a 100 health player requires enough space between you and the target to unload close to a clip into them. Again, once Phantom is in close quarters, there is minimal opportunity to do this, because you have to focus on getting the @$!# away from him. As soon as you have to reload once, you are dead.  I just think it's a crying shame. This game was all about territory, combined use of complementary classes, trade offs in gun power and accuracy, etc. Now there's this one class that completely wrecks all of that, because half of the trade offs (semi auto support guns... useless; light SMGs... useless) are not useful at all.  And so, you might think, well, just avoid close quarters. But you can't. Most maps require you to go into confined spaces to get from A to B, especially because not doing that gets your head blown off by snipers. And how the @$!# is Kira or Fragger (for instance) supposed to create space in a tight corridor to get away from a camping invisible ninja who can one-hit you with a katana?  SD needs to URGENTLY modify Phantom. I would imagine I am in their target market for 'non-hardcore' players. With no phantoms, I am a competent but not amazing player, typically ranking somewhere between the middle and top of games. I have already spent actual cash money on the starter pack in this game. Yet now I have no intention of playing while Phantom is in his current state. The game has gone from extremely fun to utterly deplorable. For the first time in many hours, I just quit out of two games in succession because of the Phantom situation.  It's up to you, Splash Damage. Fix this ASAP or lose my interest, and the interest of many others like me. You'll end up with a small player base of people with the high level of skill and many hours of free time to learn how to play this much less pleasant version of your game, while the 'enthusiast' and casual players disappear off somewhere else.  The really sad part is that until Phantom came along, this was the first online multiplayer game I've truly enjoyed since Quake III. Now that's gone."
Dirtybomb,3cxsvo,caitsith01,39,Sun Jul 12 03:05:15 2015 UTC,He ruins it for new players as well. I tried getting my friend who normally enjoy these types of games to play Dirty Bomb. He quit after an hour after repeatedly getting killed by Phantom. Imagine players who know pretty much nothing about the game joining a game with a level 20 phantom. He is going to quit the game after 10 minutes never giving it another chance.
Dirtybomb,3cxsvo,Rusemaster1,10,Sat Jul 11 23:34:28 2015 UTC,"Imagine new players joining a game with a level 20 anything, tbh."
Dirtybomb,3cxsvo,steehsda,9,Sun Jul 12 00:55:22 2015 UTC,"Nah, playing against really good players using other mercs is ok - you get used to it quickly and learn to have a healthy fear of them.  The difference is, with a good sniper or whatever, you know where they are because you can see them, and other than snipers you also have a chance to retreat.  But SD have decided that what we need is a super overpowered merc to be abused by good players who is also functionally invisible and gives you no opportunity to retreat."

That happened to be normal before the matchmaking bullshit got introduced to games... I remember having fun on tf1 or cs servers with all kinds of skilled ppl. Nowadays it seems to be: ""oh you invested alot of time in the game and dont play comp (while playing comp without a team is just random mixed shit IMO) thats wrong and I hate you for that!

You're right that he's just not fun to play against. If you encounter him running at you and you backpeddle while shooting there's a very small window to beat him. If you notice him charging you and decide to turn away and run from him, he'll just pull out his kek-10. It hasn't ruined the game for me yet, but it's just stupid gameplay."
Dirtybomb,3cxsvo,atonement179,6,Sat Jul 11 19:41:20 2015 UTC,"rofl you want to backpedal? say goodbye to your accuracy, and if you're playing as a vassilli, theres barely any time to even switch to your hugely inaccurate revolver.  heartbeat sensor is garbage for detection if you're using it right and helping scout forward areas for your team."

Dirtybomb,3cxsvo,NamelessLiberty,12,Sat Jul 11 20:50:58 2015 UTC,"Well with proxy, you just have to be good. She's a high skill ceiling kind of merc. With Aura, you should be attached to a fragger, nader, or skyhammer. With Sparks, just stay vigilant, because he's faster than you sprinting if you're running backwards. So you're fucked in most scenarios you don't catch him from medium range coming at you.   That's the problem with this merc. You ""hope"" is below average or decides not to go after you, because there isn't much defense."

Dirtybomb,3cxsvo,Ketchupkitty,13,Sat Jul 11 22:32:53 2015 UTC,"Agree. By the time you see him coming it's too late. I know SD said they didn't notice he had problems in their testing but I noticed after one match and every match since has confirmed it. So now either they nerf him and piss off all of the peeps who paid money for him or they leave him as is and piss off everyone else (more). Very poor decision making. I know they can say ""it's beta"" but that doesn't get you out of it when you're taking money for mercs and loadouts.

Dirtybomb,3cxsvo,domericano,27,Sun Jul 12 02:54:17 2015 UTC,"Long-jump forward right-click kills most squishy, and another left click deals with most non-heavy tankers. Shield to punish shooting at him, and KEK10 dominates the range you would encounter Phantom in.  Did I mention most of the time you can't hear the so called ""tell"" of the cloak machine? Either through a glitch or the fact that between a billion other things, you simply can't hear it?  Oh, and good Phantom can use it like cloaking watch from TF2? Walk past everyone, uncloak and kill everyone, gunning down or otherwise from behind?  Totally balanced."

Dirtybomb,3cxsvo,SystemPeanut,-2,Sun Jul 12 02:15:11 2015 UTC,"They identify high assists and kills as the same thing. That was the first thing I noticed that really turned me off. And they hide detailed stats on the scoreboard, sorta like DB, but even in the end game for your teammates and enemies.  The game just seems to provide every player with a LOT of positive feedback. More than they deserve. And the scoring seems designed to level the field in a way. A lot of those features appear designed as anti-toxicity measures, but I see them as anti-competition.  I really want to play Overwatch. I've been interested in it since it was revealed. I'm not really belittling its mechanics either. I think it could be a real contender, and I'm fairly confident that it will be more popular than DirtyBomb."
Dirtybomb,3cxsvo,MrBogard,6,Sun Jul 12 02:21:48 2015 UTC,"I don't personally find anything too bad about that, although I don't really like the ""Everyone is a winner!"" bullcrap."
Dirtybomb,3cxsvo,Akselmo,5,Sun Jul 12 03:07:24 2015 UTC,"I don't know, I don't see the issue with hiding detailed stats in general. Even when playing a medic of some kind and knowing that I'm doing a bunch of revives and healing, it's still very discouraging to see something like 5/11 on the final scoreboard. Sure, it's nice to see lulzy high scores, but half the time that's just because the game was horrendously balanced. Either show all of the stats or just hide them instead of choosing arbitrary 'important' stats to display.  I just don't see that as an ""Everyone's a winner"" sort of thing. It's a design choice."
Dirtybomb,3cxsvo,Zoralink,1 point,Sun Jul 12 10:54:10 2015 UTC,"5/11 is discuraging because it lacks third number - assists. I'm on the same boat with my Sparks. Besides some lucky snipes/finishes, i am just running around and getting killed."

Dirtybomb,3cxsvo,DohBot,2,Sun Jul 12 17:47:12 2015 UTC,"What's wrong with the way DirtyBomb handles it? You can score more for an assist than a kill because scoring is based on damage. That's fair and honest feedback, and you're still rewarding both players. In my opinion, a single enemy death should never register as two kills.  The first game I ever saw it implemented in was Battlefield 4, and I hate it. In that game, it simply feeds terribad snipers who do nothing for your team. They can't land headshots, but nearly every assist is high damage and thus a ""kill."" It's bullshit.   Now in Overwatch I kinda think it's worse, because it gives both players nearly identical feedback on the field. I just want the game to clearly communicate who did what. I think it's designed to make players feel good more than anything.  Performance should be its own reward in a competitive setting."
Dirtybomb,3cxsvo,MrBogard,1 point,Sun Jul 12 17:53:33 2015 UTC,Nothing I like both I would prefer kinda a scale with how much of an assist with the points as I assume the Dirty Bomb does. I wish more games would do that. My only thing that I don't like about it is that you can't find your KDR when you press Raby.
Dirtybomb,3cxsvo,DohBot,1 point,Sun Jul 12 17:57:37 2015 UTC,"I think Splash Damage got it right, or at least has come the closest to getting it right. I think DirtyBomb's combat scoring is pretty fair, but it doesn't prop up average performance.  I do not like that KDR is hidden from the scoreboard. I don't like that your teammates and enemies are either. I get that they're trying to prevent toxicity, but I don't think it's really working anyway. At the very least, tracking your own performance on the field is important."
Dirtybomb,3cxsvo,MrBogard,2,Sun Jul 12 18:04:17 2015 UTC,"As someone who has not played a blizzard game, I am curious what you mean."
Dirtybomb,3cxsvo,iTARIS,0,Sun Jul 12 02:19:35 2015 UTC,"I'm mostly leaning on all of the Overwatch videos I've watched. There are aspects of the scoring that really bother me. The game just seems to give every player the impression that they are doing awesome.  The first example of this I've noticed: high assists and kills are essentially the same thing (caveat: although they do keep a ""final blow"" statistic hidden in the end game scoring). And you can be rewarded a big ""KILL STREAK"" notification for an assist streak. It's all a little over the top.  And maybe that seems superficial.. but I think that detracts from the competitive aspect of the game."
Dirtybomb,3cxsvo,MrBogard,7,Sun Jul 12 02:26:12 2015 UTC,While I do agree that blizzard tries to appeal to the most casual gamer I do not believe that getting a kill streak for assists matters at all.  I am more concerned that they will not have features like voice chat since it may allows players to be more specific in their insults towards teammates.  If people are going to be an ass they will do it any way they are allowed restricting voice chat just stops a medium that allows players to communicate as quickly as possible and the mute button already exists if you don't want people to listen to raging players announce how to use the bloody mute button
Dirtybomb,3cxsvo,MagicMoogle,-1,Sun Jul 12 04:28:58 2015 UTC,"While I do agree that blizzard tries to appeal to the most casual gamer I do not believe that getting a kill streak for assists matters at all.   Well, I disagree. If you reward average performance you're creating an average population at best. When everyone wins, we all lose. Splash Damage has a much nicer approach here. You can still score more for an assist than a kill, but the information is still clearly conveyed to the player. I've written more detailed rants about it in the Overwatch reddit :D  That's just my two cents. One of the things I appreciate about DB is that it is courting the tryhards."
Dirtybomb,3cxsvo,MrBogard,2,Sun Jul 12 04:44:23 2015 UTC,Well what would you do to encourage good performance and how does separating kills from assist increase players skill? Overwatch is not deathmatch getting kills does not win you the game automatically it helps but you still have have to capture points and the people that are more skilled will win more they may have a higher kdr but they dont have to.  While not completely comparable professional dota games have been won by supports and they usually have a negative kdr and you don't actually have to help in dota as long as you are in a certain radius of that enemies death you get counted as an assist and I don't think people think pro dota support players are any worse than the same team's carry players (in their own roles)

Today was the first time I ever broke 10,000 in points. All you have to do is rush past enemy lines (not hard with cloak) and go for weak targets. Proxy, Aura, Kira, and some of the other squisher mercs die from a single secondary thrust. Slashes take care of the rest.  Even in my failed attempts when I couldn't nab a single kill, the cloak damage mitigation and my high health kept the enemy team busy enough to buy my own team time to get into position or repair/disarm/arm objectives.  The fact that he was released overpowered rather than underpowered feels suspiciously like a cash grab."
Dirtybomb,3cxsvo,metsuken,2,Sun Jul 12 00:11:05 2015 UTC,"Phantom gets ridiculous amounts of points because of all the melee kills he gets.  What classes do you usually play, and do you play Stopwatch? If I play a long game of Stopwatch as Arty, especially on a map with an EV, I can get over 10,000 from the sheer amount of ammunition and damage done to the EV. However, I notice I don't get quite as many points when I'm playing as Sawbonez."

Dirtybomb,3cxsvo,Wilcolt,21,Sun Jul 12 16:00:31 2015 UTC,"I feel the same way at this point. Played for a bit today, and I'm just not enjoying myself anymore.   Way to kill the game in one update, Splash Damage. It went from tons of fun, to tons of frustration. I already have enough frustration in real life. Don't need to experience it in games too.  So I will be playing other games that I can enjoy.   My condolences to those of you who spent money on this lump of shit."
Dirtybomb,3cxsvo,Polystigma,38,Sat Jul 11 23:42:02 2015 UTC,he's not a melee merc  the sad part is that people think this merc is OP when they're meeting people in pubs who are just having fun using the katana as a primary weapon (totally ignoring their KEK10)  imagine if those people were actually trying hard
Dirtybomb,3cxsvo,Busdriverx,17,Sat Jul 11 20:50:20 2015 UTC,"I've played against one of those, it was painful. Fortunately Phantom seems to attract bad players."

Dirtybomb,3cxsvo,Shade_Raven,6,Sun Jul 12 14:51:55 2015 UTC,"I just play medic now and stay behind.  I find my team is losing a lot, lots of Phantom and lots of SMG aimkick kills.  I wish I could help play the objective, but the game has changed enough for me that I'm only helpful behind the front line reviving and dropping med stations.  Sad, but it is what it is.  I hope they rebalance and patch soon, I miss the excitement of this game up front."
Dirtybomb,3cxsvo,theduderman,5,Sun Jul 12 00:17:56 2015 UTC,"Well I always have a beef with the melee in Dirty Bomb. The melee can down a player faster and easier then the guns. All they need to do is run up to a player and slash a few times in their general direction. On the other hands, guns require head shots to down some one fast.   But before the introduction of Phantom, charters that usually do this are light merc which are fast with low HP. Even if you fail to take them out with guns, you still can use your own melee to dual with them. Phantom on the other hand have insane damage melee attacks. With chopper augment, it have a 78 damage for primary melee attack and 108 for secondary attack. It will 1 shot up to vasaill and for other characters beside Fragger and Rhino, they can still be 1 shot by katana if they took any chip damage prior to that.  I'm not sure if Phantom is OP or not. Just feel that in a game where guns have high TTK, a melee which kill in 1~2 hits is out of place and also not fun to play against."

Dirtybomb,3cxsvo,PatrickSprayze,7,Sun Jul 12 04:55:03 2015 UTC,"This post nails it fairly well, a melee merc is fine if it requires skill to play, but with Phantom in his current form, he doesn't. When you're playing a comp match and you get killed by Phantom, you don't feel out-aimed or out-played, you just feel like you got killed because of a cheap class.   He's not as OP as people claim, he's just way too ez mode in a game about tactics, teamplay, and skill. The problem with him really is he's too easy to play, his shield needs a nerf, and he most definitely should not have the KEK-10.  EDIT: That being said, I don't mind him at all in pub matches, it's in comp where I find him aggravating, because if I lose a comp match, I want to know I lost because the other team either had A. Better teamwork, B. Better skill level, or C. Better knowledge of the game, not because the other team used a character that effectively functions as a crutch for players that aren't as good."

Take away the ""shield"" portion of his cloak, and he should be fine. Make him squishy. ffs, why is he so god damn tanky?   He is a recon, assassin thing, he should be super duper squishy. If you see hiim running and TAP him with a bullet he should die. Why the fuck should I be able to shoot him POINTBLANK with a shotgun, and he just slash me to death, and all he loses?

It's fast, invisible, 1-shot melee with a low skillshot sword that is also relatively tanky.  You don't need to stab people, you just need to have the sword at the apex of the stab then swing around and kill stuff. It's a completely anti-fun merc."

We had a lot of fun with the built-in 5v5 mode for a couple of weeks.  Then the Phantom patch came out and we haven't touched it since. Back to GO we go.

However,  I can agree with you that the phantom is not making the game any better. In these noobie matches I'm currently playing there usually isn't any phantoms but when there is, it's GG.  It isn't that hard to kill a phantom but it is extremely frustrating to get spawn camped by an invisible guy with a really powerful weapon."

Dirtybomb,3cxsvo,FalloutJason,4,Sun Jul 12 01:18:01 2015 UTC,"And cloaking makes you super vulnerable. You die almost instantly if you get shot. It's the polar opposite of armor in the game.

Dirtybomb,3cxsvo,PUSClFER,5,Sat Jul 11 23:24:20 2015 UTC,"You know why TF2 deals with it so well? Because spies are so fun to hunt. They don't have powerful weapons. They don't have a lot of health. And they don't have much speed. Once you detect them, it's immense fun to dispatch them especially if you're a Pyro."
Dirtybomb,3cxsvo,Wilcolt,3,Sun Jul 12 08:35:09 2015 UTC,"On top of that, it's also fun as the spy going against aware players. It forces you to be smart about your picks and actually have to try to outthink and outplay the enemy team.  It's more enjoyable for both sides.

Dirtybomb,3cxsvo,technica-,2,Sun Jul 12 13:39:27 2015 UTC,"Phantom is a complete pub stomp champ, nothing more. Last few non competitive games I have played a phantom has been top of the board with a crazy KDR(I think after the first round in one match the enemies phantom was on something stupid like 12k points, 35/7 kdr).   I have not played him as I don't own him, but he just breaks the games balance nothing seems to effectively counter him not even a point blank shotgun will kill him on full shield it is complete BS at the moment.   It really does feel like SD are taking a page from Riot games, release a new merc/champion that is OP and broken. Wait 2 weeks then nerf to bring them inline with the rest of the mercs/champions. By this point they have majority of income from the new release and can start hype for the next. But I can't see how they will release anything as broken as phantom, unless we got another character like skyhammer, but with nukes .... and sharks with friggin laser beams attached to their heads."

Ironic that most Phantoms go solo isn't it, if he's meant to discourage lone wolves? It's funny too, because the game always jokes about not seeing Phantom. I don't see him because he's always on the other side of the map, not because he's invisible."

Dirtybomb,3cxsvo,placatetr,5,Sat Jul 11 23:16:56 2015 UTC,"I think Phantom needs an adjustment for sure. Either no primary weapon or half the armour on the cloak. At the moment he has way too many outs, too many options available to him to deal with fucking up and getting caught.  But I don't think he's broken completely. Getting back stabbed by a Phantom just means you weren't covering your angles well enough, in my opinion. I can't think of a single choke point where, knowing what to look for, a Phantom should get the drop on you.  Of course as people have said, atm if you see him and he's any good you might be fucked anyway, but that just proves how bad he needs a nerf"

Dirtybomb,3cxsvo,BrainiEpic,2,Sun Jul 12 11:36:33 2015 UTC,"What really hurts most about the Phantom update: it's distracting the community from the aim punch update, which for some borders on game breaking.  Phantom is hell in pubs. Phantom's free rotation will highlight the problem w/ the current model. But you can bet your ass that he will be tweaked in light of the current backlash. Splash Damage just wants us to cool our tits first, so they can see how serious it is.  But broken gun mechanics? That ruins the whole friggin game."

Dirtybomb,3cxsvo,kein3lust,3,Sun Jul 12 00:03:35 2015 UTC,"I see this happen all the time with League. A new champ comes out and everyone wants to play them, and the champ is either OP or unplayable in the eyes of the community. Then, a week later, tiny number changes come to the champ and suddenly they're perfectly balanced, when in reality they just had enough time to learn how to play against them. Best example is Vlad. He was considered OP as shit, then they removed his move speed buff on his pooling ability and everything thought he was balanced, he win rate went down, etc. Riot never even removed the move speed buff, just put it in the patch notes and forgot to implement it, so Vlad became a ""balanced"" champ without any real changes. Mind set, attitude, and enough play time are all important when it comes to a new champion or, in this case, merc. Hell, even the threats in this are reminiscent of League ""Rito, pls fix, game unplayable"". It's childish.  How about instead of dribbling your threats and demands onto your keyboard, you make an actual constructive criticism, and give actual feedback about the merc and what you want to see changed in him instead of just outright removing him. I feel that if the shield was removed from his cloak, he may be a more balanced merc given his health pool of 120."
Dirtybomb,3cxsvo,harglefla,4,Sun Jul 12 04:18:34 2015 UTC,"While I agree a little bit, he needs to have some risk involved with diving the backline (proxy, aura, sparks). He has more health and instagibs them if he gets the jump (which he will at some point). The shield is too strong.   I kind of feel like once he's not invisible he should be very vulnerable instead of bushwhacker + 10 health.   He makes playing proxy not enjoyable. Its stupid that the mines don't kill him and he one shots her. If you're playing sparks, he instantly nukes your team and instantly finishes them then comes for you wall jumping while you desperately try to hit him in the head with your peashooter. Aura can stand in her healing station and be 1-shot.   As a huge fan of league, there isn't any counter play for most mercs and there just isn't anything dissuading phantom from just straight up sprinting at your lighter classes. Make him slower, make him have less health and take away what is widely agreed as one of the better weapons in the game. Or some combination. Or raise the cooldown on his invisibility--here's what I do, go invis when rounding corners then un-invis with a sword swipe until the shield is off CD. That's stupid....its basically 100% uptime."

Dirtybomb,3cxsvo,WickedMakoto,1 point,Sun Jul 12 04:29:17 2015 UTC,"Oh yes, I see that. It seems that the recoil has been increased considerably when being shot, which needs to be addressed. I think it's very important to realize that this is a beta environment. The game isn't polished or finished, and upon release half the damn game could be different. When League was in beta, Twisted Fate had his global teleport at level 1. Blitz could pull his allies. The game was broken as shit! But people kept playing, kept giving feedback, kept laughing and just having fun with friends doing stupid things.   EDIT: Probably should have had this in the first place. And look at League now. The vast majority of champs are considered balanced in the eyes of the community and it's the biggest online game going at the moment."
Dirtybomb,3cxsvo,harglefla,2,Sun Jul 12 04:39:52 2015 UTC,"Yes, I understand and agree, I was in the League beta too. It doesn't mean that the community behind the game can't speak loudly about it and hope for a response from the devs. If we, as a community, get more of a response than Riot gave back in their beta days, I'll be happy about it.  Although, if no response is given...nobody can say that we didn't say anything, nobody can say that we didn't give options or ideas. This is a waiting game now, to see if they respond before the community really begins to hemorrhage players, even if it's temporary."

Dirtybomb,3cxsvo,aSheepamongWolves,4,Sun Jul 12 00:45:01 2015 UTC,"He wouldn't be played. Either because of balance issues making him bannable, or because he's obviously just a pubstomp merc."
Dirtybomb,3cxsvo,littlestminish,1 point,Sun Jul 12 01:33:22 2015 UTC,"He's a good defense merc, not as much offense. (Because his contribution to pushing an objective in minimal, but his ability to flank and ruin a push is really good.)"
Dirtybomb,3cxsvo,Oblivion_Lost667,1 point,Sun Jul 12 02:16:13 2015 UTC,I feel a good way to balance Phantom would be to remove his gun entirely. I don't feel phantom is that annoying. I also haven't seen a Phantom carry a game since he first launched  Phantom is also only good with 1-2 on a team. Any more and you completely fail at objectives
Dirtybomb,3cxsvo,pokeplun,1 point,Sun Jul 12 00:55:40 2015 UTC,"Honestly, they should take away their armor bonus and SMG/sidearm and have them only be armed with a katana. Easy fix. They retain their stealth usefulness, dont have the full range of capabilities of a normal ranged class.   Boom, no more overpowered Phantom, still useful and adds variety to the lineup."

Dirtybomb,3cxsvo,BlackHazrd,3,Sun Jul 12 12:42:35 2015 UTC,"I feel like people are way over reacting about phantom. People just have to change the way they play a little bit to compensate for this change. Phantom just sounds a lot stronger on paper than in practice. When phantom is invisible it is not that difficult to spot him. You have to realize that his shield only blocks damage when he is invisible.  And for new players, this game just has a huge learning curve to begin with but that;s what makes you want to keep playing. This is a game where you have to clock in a decent amount of hours. Give it some time, instead of complaining about how powerful phantom is, figure out how to play against it effectively. Most new mercs will seem op because people will have no idea what to do. That's just what i think."
Dirtybomb,3cxsvo,riotrusher,4,Sun Jul 12 01:26:20 2015 UTC,"But you also have to remember that there's some important classes with around 90 hp. When phantom is cloaked, he has the damage-absorbing shield AND he can attack from it. Any semi-decent phantom could just run around all day insta-killing anyone who is unlucky enough to be playing an objective-oriented class.  When I switch to fragger or even sawbones, I have very little problem with phantom. When I'm playing proxy or aura, I better just get used to dying without a fight."

I'm not saying I disagree with this, but I think the real underlying problem is the matchmaking system. If matches were found not only based on ping but also skill (let's say we implement this into ranked play), then, and only then, I feel like we can make actual comparisons between mercs to determine if some are better than others."

Katana isn't a guaranteed item on the loadout cards, and they gave him a silly stealth shield and the best midrange guns in the game, with the katana's broken-ness being effectively an afterthought.  It was really the devs' attempt to make him this sort of sneaky generalist character, instead of making him a vulnerable flanker-assassin with little ranged power, that truly borked the game meta."

But on the real, play with a higher FOV and look around more. I rarely get killed by Phantoms who want to just sword things and I mostly play classes that are one shot by him (Proxy and Kira). Its the ones who recognize that I am aloof and SMG duel me. Given that he has more HP than me, I will lose if I don't significantly out duel him."

If you're actually encountering a cheater in EVERY GAME, then you either have the worst luck in the world, or you're not telling the truth.  There's the hackers that go 100-0 and then there's good players that get accused of hacking every time they play well. It's a terrible shame that good players are getting kicked from games regularly because cheat accusation are the go-to counter play.  Splash Damage is working on it. There are a shit ton of issues with this game, but they have maintained that fixing anti-cheat is their #1 priority. Maybe you should take a break until it's fixed.

Dirtybomb,3d2hhc,iTARIS,3,Mon Jul 13 06:03:43 2015 UTC,"I find the opposite. Most of the cheaters are blatant, aimbotting down half my team or prefiring me consistently and then going nuts when I call them out .

Dirtybomb,3d2hhc,iTARIS,0,Mon Jul 13 07:56:03 2015 UTC,"If you (and others) are expecting it to be blatant all the time, then that is why it may seem there is less cheaters. A lot of players try to hide that they are cheating.  A few examples:  Intermittently turning on the aimbot to hit harder, moving targets. One moment it seems to be a legit player, then he momentarily turns it on, and you see the crosshairs snapping instantly to the head of target, he shoots and then turn it off for a few moments..  *Speedhack: a team member, you and him the same character (with the melee weapon out), and he sprints 1.5x or more faster than you..  *Wallhack: players waiting in corners, pre-firing. Some even momentarily forget they are cheating and start firing at the walls...

Banning based on demo evidence takes long and if a player isn't stupid he will not get caught. Also clean players have lots of ""suspicious"" scenes every other game; it's not that easy to tell what is cheat and what is communication or luck. I'm not familiar with Planetside 2 but I can't see stats bust anyone other than really obvious cheaters!?  And screengrabbing has been bypassed time and time again and is also often buggy.  I feel like free2play game will always have a cheater problem anyways, especially while there are no private public servers. Cups and leagues have a way to track participating players because they can eye new players, but anyone playing public and matchmaking can just keep creating new accounts and there will always be working bots."

Dirty Bomb is pretty pickup and play with a high skill ceiling thanks to all the intricacies there are in movement.  There are some newbie pitfalls to watch out for, though:  Don't aim down sights. I know a lot of people like to do this at extreme ranges, but at that range you're usually too far out of your effective range for shooting at them to be effective. (There are minimum damage ranges on weapons in this game, some better than others)  Always run with your melee weapon out.  Remember to play dirty. (And to drop ammo)"

I'm not sure why, but I tend to strafe less from side to side while using this gun, and instead I try to stop at random parts of my strafe to prevent getting headshotted (because viewpunch sucks while using this gun, so I actively try to dodge). Stopping in place and slowing down my fire rate seems to help out a lot while handling that recoil.  And use crouch too. Believe me, it's not as bad as people think."

Dirtybomb,3czrs2,SowakaWaka,11,Sun Jul 12 21:14:48 2015 UTC,"I actually bought him, despite not seeing any Rhinos do well in-game. He's fantastic if you play him right but he's incredibly vulnerable in a LOT of ways, nobody seems to take advantage. For one, if he's not spun up he's almost a free kill but when spun up you'll always know where he is. Two, he's only decent in short to medium-short range, don't run into his range in a firefight, running backwards is incredibly beneficial.  Typically the people that complain are the type that run towards you spraying their primaries, not realizing that he takes a different approach, they're used to that tactic working against 90% of enemies and don't realize that Rhino will soak the damage and start dealing more damage the closer they are. He's damn difficult to play and I often find myself switching off the character for a longer range character due to battlefield conditions, but he's great at what he does.  Anyhow, if you're struggling with Rhino... keep your distance and make yourself a small target. Don't attempt to fight him in close quarters with a low-HP class unless you're taking him surprise or know for certain he has already taken damage. Also, listen for his minigun spin. When playing I always found it obvious when a Rhino was hiding nearby around a corner but the number of players that just run by me, seemingly unaware of my existence, is astonishing. Also, if you hear his mini stop spinning then he might have whipped out his shotgun and be running straight towards the corner you're hiding behind. My personal favorite trick is to spray an area to lock someone into a position, then switch to my shotgun and surprise them with a blast to the face."

Dirtybomb,3czrs2,iForkyou,6,Sun Jul 12 16:53:27 2015 UTC,"However playing Sawbones means you die a lot, often getting killed while trying to revive fallen team members. Your K/D ratio is always skewed towards D if you try to help the team.   Look, not really. I am not a KD whore or anything, but a good Sawbonez has the potential for even better KDs than Fraggers, Naders ETC, due to the fact that you basically have infinite sustain and can regen very quick. Your primary goal as a Medic is to stay alive and you should only ever suicide rez when you really need to(rez that proxy to disarm the C4 PRONTO). The only classes in the game who can really tank your KD are Engineers, since a lot of the time you may be going for suicide constructions/repairs/C4 disarms.  As for Rhino, let me preface by saying that I don't think he is OP, just ultra easy to use. Even without your minigun, the only way people are dealing with a mediocre aim Rhino at close range is headshots, since he has 200 HP. DB is a game about very long bodyshot time to kill and headshots, but Rhino's minigun has ridiculous enough DPS that he doesn't have to headshot at all, whereas the enemies have to.  The common argument is that his range limitations and slow speed make him more difficult to play. Not at all actually. They make him limited in his potential and restrict him to camping objectives/corners/CQC situation, but in no way is he more difficult to play.  And his synergy with the healing stations is utterly fucking ridiculous. The already OP health station coupled with Rhino's ridiculous HP mean that unless you hit 100% headshots you basically have to destroy the health station first. Just play on underground and have an Aura place a health station on the first C4 point. Unless the enemy team goes 3 Naders/Fraggers you are basically invincible.  The worst thing is that his ability can solo win an engagement and trump skill completely. No matter how good of an SMG proxy you are you are not killing a deployed Rhino CQC unless he is braindead. The only other class ability that can basically guarantee an engagement win in CQC is a good Nader shot or a cooked Fragger grenade(although this one is not really applicable to CQC) and those require much more skill to use AND you can starve them of resources. I can force Naders to miss a few nades then close in for the kill. I can't force deployed Rhinos to do shit, if they are even remotely competent and I'm not Nader/Fragger I can't take them head on AT ALL."
Dirtybomb,3czrs2,Voxel_Sigma,3,Sun Jul 12 10:27:15 2015 UTC,"See, you are still playing on <lvl10 servers. People are constantly crying and bitching there.

As soon as you start getting into lvl 10+ games, it becomes way more relaxed. People are actually trying to win by outplaying the enemy instead of giving up as soon as they get wrecked by a merc they consider overpowered. Just relax, level up and enjoy a game with less bitching later on."
Dirtybomb,3czrs2,username4125,2,Sun Jul 12 11:24:31 2015 UTC,I thought he was op until i realized the key to owning him is staying out of his mgs range and shooting his fat head.

Aimpunch does... exactly this. You start getting shot and suddenly your old reliable friendly cursor isn't doing what you expect it to.

Dirtybomb,3czsn8,asdfrofl1,9,Sun Jul 12 15:14:30 2015 UTC,"Courtesy of Ardez on the forums, I'll probably give a little history lesson on what viewpunch (aimpunch) is:  Aimpunch was always in the game. It's a visual cue that you're being shot, and is meant to distort the player that is being shot. During Alpha (which I wasn't in, sadly), aimpunch was implemented and people complained about how broken it was of a mechanic. Mind you, these players didn't have as many hours as some of us to now (300+ hours on me), yet the devs understood that the mechanic was a frustration to the players. Therefore in beta, they lowered it to  such low amounts that every gun was a laser rifle. During this beta phase, the Blishlok and Dreiss were actually some of the better guns. Damage per bullet was great on both, and Dreiss' spread wasn't as ridiculous as it is now (stop nerfing that shit yo). Vets (who had more hours now) also notified the devs that these weapons were strong- too strong. Now moving onto after beta phase, the devs decided to revert the values of aimpunch. The viewkick that you get is now smaller by small hits (SMGs on your torso, pistol on your legs, sniper shot on your arms, etc) and larger by larger hits (basically anything that hits your face, Nader's nades, etc). Now the vets are angry because we can get shat on people who have less than 25 hours in the game, simply because they happened to land a lucky shot on the head. The values should be decreased, that's all.  Custom servers are never going to be a thing, but private matches will. Players will be able to create their own lobbies with their friends/ players will be able to scrim without using DirtyCups servers. The reason why they won't ever have ""private servers"" (which are basically admin-run servers) is because the devs are afraid that this would only cause more mischief in the community, IE; hacking or scripting. However, devs do want players to be able to explore maps on their own and such, which is why we're given private official servers instead.  You're probably more accustomed to the M4A1. I dubbed it the ""most forgiving gun in the game"" because it has the lowest recoil ever (even lower than some SMGs I believe). However, yes, Arty needs a rework in his abilities. He's too decent compared to Skyhammer and Kira, who both have very strong and continuous area denial. His ammo packs aren't really that special compared to Skyhammer's either, which just makes him average across the board.  TLDR: Dirty bomb history lesson.  Aimpunch has been in this game for a long time. Its values has been changed, and people (especially the vets) are angry that this mechanic is in the game. Values just need to be lowered, that's all.  Private servers aren't going to be a thing (which are basically admin-run servers), but private matches will.  M4A1 is the easiest gun in the game. Arty is average across the board, and needs a rework if he wants to become anything like Skyhammer."

Dirtybomb,3czsn8,ipisano,1 point,Sun Jul 12 13:49:43 2015 UTC,"no arty is pretty underpowered at the moment, i think the general consensus is that he's outclassed by skyhammer and kira.  regarding aimpunch, i come from games that have it as well, and while i do notice it more when i'm in a duel with someone, I'm not sure if i'm avidly opposed to it... yet."
Dirtybomb,3czsn8,kAndyREW,-1,Sun Jul 12 15:36:12 2015 UTC,"The majority of the players here just circle-jerk-cry for the sake of it. Aimpunch isn't much of a problem. Good players who got good scores before....still do. And Phantom is not overpowered and fairly easy to deal with if you invest five minutes to think. Sniper cancels out Phantom, you can see him if he is running....so he is slow and you can HEAR him loud and clear if he is around. People have always been salty towards stealth, snipers, and so forth in any game  so I've experienced, so I am not surprised by the outlash."
Dirtybomb,3czsn8,stinkyeel,2,Sun Jul 12 08:54:13 2015 UTC,"Frankly I have a very decent aiming in this game (250 hours played) and ever since the patch my K/D have obviously gone down. It definitely feels like I'm losing fights against bad aimers, and even though noob stomping isn't fun, not being rewarded for your skill by highers KDRs feels very VERY frustrating.  I honestly feel like it's also why you see lvl 10+ players playing Phantom. He doesn't require any aiming skill, so he's perfect in a game that doesn't reward aiming skills anymore.  PS: I agree Phantom isn't very OP and just requires some tweaks."
Dirtybomb,3czsn8,CaptainShaky,-1,Sun Jul 12 09:53:47 2015 UTC,"d even though noob stomping isn't fun, not being rewarded for your skill by highers KDRs feels very VERY frustratin   Your statement makes no sense. If you lost to someone that sucks at aiming it's on you because if you are clearly better at aiming aimpunch should only affect the bad aimer because you are hitting him more.  The logic of people in this game really kills me, the fact is bad players aren't going to get good and good people aren't going to get bad. The only thing that aimpunch affect are people in the same skill bracket going 1 v 1, but then again if you get flanked and shot first the player is probably more skilled because he knew you don't watch your flank like 90% of DB players."
Dirtybomb,3czsn8,BlackHazrd,1 point,Sun Jul 12 15:25:14 2015 UTC,"1v1 scenario - bad aimer shoots good aimer first. Bad aimer then kills good aimer because even though his aim is superior the RNG that is aim punch means despite the good aimer tracking the bad aimers head, his bullets are flying off at a 45 degree angle. Previously the good aimer (despite firing 2nd will out aim the bad player but that is not the case since RNG aimpunch was tweaked.  As someone who came from top lvl BF4 comp it (suppression it's called) is also viewed as a cancer but noobs love it."
Dirtybomb,3czsn8,JGStonedRaider,1 point,Mon Jul 13 01:19:51 2015 UTC,The bad aimer should only get like 2 or 3 hits. This game has movement. A bad aim can't track someone wall jumping. Don't say you came from a Comp from a different game.
Dirtybomb,3czsn8,BlackHazrd,-3,Mon Jul 13 01:40:56 2015 UTC,"Arty is basically the unanimous weakest merc in the game. I personally like him a bit but he does feel a tier below everyone else. His semi auto is godly, and I like the spammability of his arty.  This aimpunch shit is being taken way out of proportion. They are acting like it ruins the game. It doesn't. Just adapt since it isn't really that hard to overcome"

Dirtybomb,3czsn8,Citronxzme,1 point,Sun Jul 12 07:33:29 2015 UTC,"I didn't play Kira and Skyhammer that much, but I think Arty's advantage is also the fact that you can aim walls from very far away and it aims for the ground below (Skyhammer's grenade can't be thrown too far and Kira's laser will aim for the wall if aimed on a wall if I'm not wrong?). Arty's ability should also be more ""silent"" that Skyhammer's (that's for sure) and is set up more quickly than Kira. But the damage it does compared to both is ridiculously low, indeed."
Dirtybomb,3czsn8,SowakaWaka,1 point,Sun Jul 12 08:08:46 2015 UTC,"I've actually been questioning the damage of it... one airstrike rarely seems to kill anyone and I swear I've had people survive two volleys from it before, though it may have just looked like the second hit. Also, the indicator sound that lets you know when a strike has been successfully been called down is ridiculously quiet, sometimes I end up accidentally placing both strikes unintentionally because I couldn't hear the first one go off : ("

But the artillery shots are random, like Crystal Maiden's ultimate in Dota: it can be devastating or your target can luckily slalom between the shots. But if someone stays under it for the full duration (well, that's to say 1 second), he's dead, even a Phantom with a full cloak."

As a side note on the machine pistols:   This is hinted at by their names, the MP400, Tolen MP, and even the Empire-9.  DB weapon-names are made up to avoid legal issues, but my guesses (from loadout-card silhouettes and google-image searches) are:    H&K SP89 DC9 Brügger & Thomet MP9."

If you are used to playing sniper you'll probably do great with sparks.

Vasilli is only an asset to his team if his aim is superb, that is all he does.  Every other class can be an asset even with poor aim.  The sniper rifles which can insta gib have the worst dps in the game by a huge margin and need consistent headshots to be useful.  The fast shooting sniper rifle, the pdp 70, has amazing dps but always having to scope to hit things makes your character slow And easy to hit in gun duels, so you still need good aim or they will take you out.  All the other classes have more forgiving weapons and other non aim related things they can do - grenade, healing, ammo, doing objectives, etc.    That being said, vasilli is a combat class.  You would want an engineer and a healer or ammo giver for your other 2 slots."

However I run proxy with the remmburg and I usually find myself at the top of the scoreboard in public games. Most classes take 1-2 shots to die and the shotguns all have a high rate of fire, this means I can kill people before they have time to react, even if the first shot isnt a kill."

Dirtybomb,3d1yla,LLAMATARIANISM,2,Sun Jul 12 22:02:11 2015 UTC,"If SD want this game to succeed they should balance the game around pubs and allow that to evolve into meta for pugs.

Dirtybomb,3d1yla,DOGpls,1 point,Sun Jul 12 22:48:19 2015 UTC,Shotgun is really good if you're good at shotguns. They require a different skillset. I find myself doing much better with a shotgun versus an SMG
Dirtybomb,3d1yla,LLAMATARIANISM,0,Tue Jul 14 01:22:19 2015 UTC,Highly disagree. I don't think they need fixing at all. The Remburg is one of the most powerful weapons in the game to the point where just a few weeks ago people wanted it to be nerf'd.  I think the hidden logic to your reasoning is that SMG loadouts are better because they are easier to use. Shotguns require some aiming where as SMGs can be sprayed around which make them seem better. I would say that a good shotgunner could beat a sub-average SMG user a majority of the time.
Dirtybomb,3d1yla,Nantei,0,Sun Jul 12 22:29:12 2015 UTC,"Shotguns require some aiming    Wat? One of the main advantages to shotties is that you don't have to be precise - because of the spread, you're almost guaranteed to do some damage. SMGs require far more accuracy because you have to be able to track your target over an extended period of time. This is especially true for the Blishlok, which is the only SMG available to Aura and Fletcher."
Dirtybomb,3d1yla,LLAMATARIANISM,3,Sun Jul 12 22:40:15 2015 UTC,"That's totally untrue unless you're using that god-awful Reimburg, which is only better than the pump if your aim is bad. Overall the shotguns are just worse than automatic weapons because their effective range is far too short, and they have a high level of risk with very little reward comparatively speaking. There's only a small handful of tourney players that use a shotgun, and they always use the pump."
Dirtybomb,3d1yla,Nantei,0,Sun Jul 12 23:14:03 2015 UTC,"It's totally untrue that shotties have spread? And that you need to track targets with auto weapons? Sorry, I missed the patch where they implemented slugs and the auto-pistol from Titanfall.  And at no point did I say that shotties were good. I hate them. My main frustration with the game early on was that I wanted to play medic, but if I did then I couldn't shoot things far away because my cards only had shotties."
Dirtybomb,3d1yla,LLAMATARIANISM,2,Sun Jul 12 23:17:46 2015 UTC,Have you even used the pump shotgun? The spread is nearly non-existent. It shoots in a perfect star every time and should not meaningfully deviate unless you are outside your effective range. And thanks for strawmanning me. I wasn't arguing that shotguns didn't have spread.

Yes I have experience with shotties, and no, they do not require any more accuracy than autos. They require you to put your crosshair vaguely near your target and click 3 times. The whole point of a shotty is to have a low skill floor and a low skill ceiling.  And you said that my post was untrue. I was inquiring as to what part of my post was untrue. All I said was that shotties have spread and autos require tracking. Are those not true?"

Dirtybomb,3cyxxb,piercehead,15,Sun Jul 12 03:10:42 2015 UTC,It's a stupid idea. All it accomplishes is pre-made teams getting an even greater advantage by being able to talk to their teammates while dead while the other team can't.
Dirtybomb,3cyxxb,zencornhopper,-5,Sun Jul 12 04:50:27 2015 UTC,why wouldn't the other be able to? any gamer these days that doesn't have a mic/headset shouldn't be playing a team oriented game in which communication is key.
Dirtybomb,3cyxxb,johanniss,2,Sun Jul 12 05:00:20 2015 UTC,During the game hell yeah. Communicating w/ the team is so important. I'm talking about what the thread is complaining about. The fact that you aren't allowed to talk when you are dead.
Dirtybomb,3cyxxb,zencornhopper,-2,Sun Jul 12 05:03:33 2015 UTC,"so what? you're still part of the team, what you're basically saying makes no sense at all, pre-made teams can already communicate using Skype, TS3, Ventrillo. By not letting players talk when they're dead they are already putting people at disadvantage."

I get that this might be an attempt to artificially lengthen the lifetime of the game, but it's just such an annoying feature.

Prior to the Double Credits Weekend, I would typically get 100 to 300 credits per game. A loss would typically give 150 credits or so. A win would gives 250+ I've gained roughly 50k credits between completing missions and the double credits. For just 3 days of play, unlocking a merc is excellent. If you were playing a game like league of legends, you'd have to play for 7 to 10 days, 3 to 4 hours a day to unlock the highest tier of character"
Dirtybomb,3d16zq,OperativeLawson,2,Sun Jul 12 19:30:10 2015 UTC,"It's double credits for the base credits earned, not for the missions or daily win/play types.

Dirtybomb,3d16zq,Ballsackologist,1 point,Sun Jul 12 17:55:39 2015 UTC,"I'm having fun. But you know what would be more fun? Playing with more people than the free rotation.  I'm trying to do what is included in the game. The ability to buy mercs for free.   Yes, it's a fun game, but there comes a time you say ""Damn, I really am sick of playing as these three classes""  Or you see another class being played and think ""Damn, I want to play as them, see how they are""  But apparently I can't do that without paying real money (Fuck that) or grinding heavily until I have enough credits.  In comes double credit weekend! Finally a chance to get a 50k merc!   WRONG. I SHOULD have 50k already, but because of the flawed system, I only have earned 2k more after 5 games.  Awesome Double Credit Weekend...   At least with other games that introduce ""Double xp, Double Money"" weekends, they do it on everygame you play..."
Dirtybomb,3d16zq,rvrs,8,Sun Jul 12 18:13:30 2015 UTC,"You can't play an F2P game, swear to not pay any money and then expect to unlock paid content within a day of casual play. I agree that it's no fun to grind content, but if you just play normally you can easily get a new merc every two weeks or so. How is that bad?"
Dirtybomb,3d16zq,rvrs,-6,Sun Jul 12 18:57:04 2015 UTC,"Because that's TWO WEEKS.  Also, since it's free to play shouldn't there be an incentive to play?  Also the quests suck ass. ""Play 5 times with Nader"" what if I don't like playing as nader? What about quests that actually help the team? Defuse 100 C4... something so people stop kill whoring and actually play to WIN."
Dirtybomb,3d16zq,Spannzer,7,Sun Jul 12 19:06:49 2015 UTC,"At two weeks per merc you'll need what? 4 months to unlock every single merc? Not even paying a single cent, and not all mercs are appealing to everyone. The incentive to play is... to play. It's a game, you should have fun just running around shooting people. If the only reason you actually play is to increase your credit count, then yeah, you might have a problem not even the devs can fix."
Dirtybomb,3d16zq,Ballsackologist,-10,Sun Jul 12 19:33:28 2015 UTC,"jesus christ, you don't seem to understand anything do you.  I want to play with ALL the mercs... I don't like having only 4 of them at a time. I also don't have the MONEY to buy characters on a video game. Instead, I'd like a way to oh, I don't know within a week get 1 new merc. So I can play the game for the 4 months, and actually have fun, instead of spending 4 months grinding."
Dirtybomb,3d16zq,Ballsackologist,2,Sun Jul 12 19:40:42 2015 UTC,"Seriously, even if you drop £10-£20 that's still cheap for the quality of the game. Usually with f2p games that I enjoy I treat them like regular games, I throw down £10-£30 depending on what I'd be happy to pay for for the product. If you're coming to a f2p game and you're upset that the game isn't legitimately free you are acting quite entitled."
Dirtybomb,3d16zq,Drtrider,7,Mon Jul 13 13:20:14 2015 UTC,Why should you have 50k after playing 5 games? That's like 1-2 hours of gameplay at most. Many people have calculated the average it will take to get 50k credits and it is a lot longer than 4 hours (which is what you seem to expect). If everyone could grind out 50k in 4 hours then Splash Damage wouldn't make any money because there would be no point in spending money to buying mercs as it would be too easy.
Dirtybomb,3d16zq,Ballsackologist,-4,Sun Jul 12 18:17:05 2015 UTC,Not saying 50k after 5 games but god damn 500 a game? At least give the double so you can get 1k a game... The missions suck too. 500 a mission? Okay why not just play one game instead? There is no reason to even go for missions...
Dirtybomb,3d16zq,negbot1,6,Sun Jul 12 18:23:20 2015 UTC,"The missions are the best way to earn credits. Also play one objective and one stop watch game a day (500 credits per, everyday) plus you get 500 for your first win of the day.  You're earning double with the ~500 a game already. So what you're looking for is quad credit weekend? Even at an average of 1000 credits per game that would still take you 50 games to earn 50k, 10 times the amount that you feel should give you a free merc."
Dirtybomb,3d16zq,rvrs,-3,Sun Jul 12 18:27:40 2015 UTC,"So my 500 credits ARE doubled? That is fucking awful considering I normally get 500 a game.

But then again I don't really pay attention to my credits because I play the game to have fun, not to grind a currency.   OP also doesn't seem to understand how to credit system works. It's mostly based on time spent in game and doesn't have to do with your score, kills, or rank in the game. If you're smashing the opponent in 4 minutes every game you aren't going to get much."
Dirtybomb,3d16zq,Lhox,-2,Sun Jul 12 18:12:33 2015 UTC,"credit system works. It's mostly based on time spent in game and doesn't have to do with your score, kills, or rank in the game. If you're smashing the opponent in 4 minutes every game you aren't going to get much.   So there is literally no reason to win the game. Why should I rush in and plant the c4 immediately? When I could plant it near the end? There is literally NO REASON to do good in the game. WHY should I come in first when I get the same amount of credits as the person who came in last?   Why should I revive people if the only thing is does good for is my XP? Seriously, that's dumb. I see my xp going THROUGH THE ROOF after a win simply because I'm doing the best on the team, revives, ammo, c4, defuse... whatever... but god damn my credits? Ha, you get none 8-)"
Dirtybomb,3d16zq,Lhox,3,Sun Jul 12 19:09:44 2015 UTC,"I'm more disappointed with the way base credits work. There is no merit or rewarding, base credits are entirely reliant on time spent from what I can see. This directly gates all progress and purchases behind a minimum hour amount of play. It is very unsatisfying when I play extremely well one match and only receive 200 credits.   They should implement a multiplier system based on score board position, as in 1st place gets base credit x 3, 2nd and 3rd get base credits x 2, etc. That or give credits for medals. When I get an Ace or a massive killstreak or 25+ kills/revives it'd be nice to be rewarded for it. It's cool that they acknowledge good play, but stupid they don't really seem to care beyond giving you a worthless little medal."
Dirtybomb,3d16zq,Lhox,4,Sun Jul 12 18:30:41 2015 UTC,"That would just be a massive incentive to cheat. Tiny little rank images seem enough to get people to cheat in matchmaking, now think what credits would do."
Dirtybomb,3d16zq,Lhox,0,Sun Jul 12 18:52:59 2015 UTC,"How about they develop a working anti-cheat? Ever think of that? People complain all the itme about the hackers in Competitive. Instead of ""Let's NOT make the game so people WANT to hack"" how about ""Let's make the game about winning, and if people hack, THEY CAN'T LOL. And if they do... they GET BANNED LOL, fuck hackers""  you're defending hacking. and cheating.  The funny part is... people don't hack to win, they hack because they are assholes.  What happens when they unlock everything? You know what they will do... turn on an autobot and just kill everyone because they are 12 and have no friends, or just want to see people rage."
Dirtybomb,3d16zq,Lolololage,3,Sun Jul 12 19:11:24 2015 UTC,"I don't know a single game out there that has a perfectly working anti-cheat. I'm not defending cheating but that's the reality. The system you propose is just asking for abuse and exploitation, whether it's cheats or glitches or just simple statpadding on empty servers. And then there's also the aspect of fairness. Monetary rewards for in-game performance is a bad idea whichever way you look at it."
Dirtybomb,3d16zq,Lolololage,0,Sun Jul 12 19:29:00 2015 UTC,"There is ways to combat statpadding. Just make it the only way you can gain credits and xp is in games with more than X number of people. Easy.  monetary rewards for in game performance is NOT a bad idea at all. It makes you WANT to win, instead of just do subpar.  So next game I play, I won't try to actually plant the c4. I'll just sit back and spawn camp. Because why do the objective when I'll get the same amount of credits as the 1st place person. YOUR system encourages laziness, and lonewolf, not teamwork."

I wish I could remember some quotes, I remember seeing quite a few good ones in the threads discussing game balance and Phantom. Many of them were basically along the lines of no pub player could possibly understand the complexities of the game because they haven't played competitive MM or done any pugs/dirty cups. Because of this all pub players' opinions are completely invalid. The word choice seriously reminds me of white colonialist authors talking about dirty savages from the dark continent."
Dirtybomb,3cyfjr,TwoThreeSkidoo,3,Sun Jul 12 17:07:17 2015 UTC,The player energy that goes around in this game is very comparable to how the chivalry: mideval warfare community has been since forever.  -The game is frustrating as shit but fun enough to keep you playing.  -Nobody can figure out what is actually balanced or what is actually OP because everything is just opinions and we don't have the statistics to say otherwise right now.  -There is a very loud little percentage of players who are unhappy with the business model of the devs.  -The game's mechanics aren't hard to figure out but the skill divide between casual players and veterans is so high that if they encounter each other in game it creates a frustrating and unsatisfying environment for both parties.

Dirtybomb,3cyfjr,Mellowsnake,-4,Sat Jul 11 22:49:52 2015 UTC,The only people that complain about it dont understand the mechanic of how it works and how easy it is to fight against?
Dirtybomb,3cyfjr,Nantei,-8,Sun Jul 12 00:01:29 2015 UTC,So he's objectively the worst merc in the game? Good to know.  It's very telling that people who complain about the smart pistol complain about Phantom. The smart pistol has the highest TTK of every weapon in the game. It's objectively worse than a good player with a good gun.
Dirtybomb,3cyfjr,pnellesen,2,Sat Jul 11 23:54:28 2015 UTC,"Well, I was referring more to peoples' reactions/opinions rather than overall effectiveness ;)  The chat in DB when a Phantom is around is quite similar to the chat in Titanfall when an SP user showed up..  (I happen to agree with you, btw.)"
Dirtybomb,3cyfjr,dismal626,0,Sun Jul 12 00:01:14 2015 UTC,objectively   You keep using that word; I do not think it means what you think it means.
Dirtybomb,3cyfjr,Nantei,-5,Sun Jul 12 00:03:36 2015 UTC,"not influenced by personal feelings, interpretations, or prejudice; based on facts; unbiased: an objective opinion. intent upon or dealing with things external to the mind rather than with thoughts or feelings, as a person or a book.  I think you're the one who's fuzzy on the definitions here. It is factually superior to other weapons. Anyone with half a brain could tell you that. Just as Phantom offers less to a team in this group-up mindset than other mercs in tournament play. Nothing in his kit permits him to deal with groups or gib people quickly, making him a niche pick at best.  Also sorry Pnellesen, I assumed you were on the bandwagon. Most people complain about the SP just as they complain about Phantom."

Dirtybomb,3cytia,IAmPixelTwitch,9,Sun Jul 12 00:41:41 2015 UTC,"I agree that simply saying ""OP"" is an oversimplification:   Phantom isn't just OP, he's OP in the wrong ways: He's too good at frontal-attacks and wading into large crowds. This means we need a complex nerf that addresses those problem-areas, while preserving his unique abilities to infiltrate, escape, and assassinate unwary single-targets.     Shooting a cloaked Phantom should make it harder for him to approach you for melee. Shooting a cloaked Phantom should temporarily reduce his ranged accuracy. The Katana's heavy-strike should be ""charged and released"", which decloaks him early and decreases his sustained DPS. All melee heavy-strikes will be limited to affecting single targets. (If still needed) Reduce his uncloaked speed   These changes should have minimal impact on Phantoms who are truly being sneaky and eliminating high-value targets.   Source suggestion thread"
Dirtybomb,3cytia,Terr_,2,Sun Jul 12 03:58:56 2015 UTC,"I agree with this. Though if I remember correctly, the suggestion for #1 was Phantom getting pushed back when shot at. It'd really be a stupid mechanic imo. #2 is already in the game, and no one likes it, it's called aim punch. On #5, Phantom is already pretty damn slow."
Dirtybomb,3cytia,CaptainShaky,1 point,Sun Jul 12 09:35:33 2015 UTC,"Uhm, no, I don't want either of those. Please check the details in the link.  Knockback is not good because it is too jarring and generally pisses people off in online FPS games. Instead, reduce the maximum speed Phantom can achieve in a given direction, should he choose to ""push"" that way. (Code-wise, you could quantize his speed-envelope as 8 vectors.) Much less frustrating, same result in terms of preventing him from closing to melee range.  Aim punch is not good because you can't really make it a status-effect that lingers very long... Unless you want to simulate Parkinson's disease from phantom (hah) bullets. Just bump up the cone of fire on his weapons and have it gradually recover."
Dirtybomb,3cytia,Terr_,3,Sun Jul 12 19:49:22 2015 UTC,"melee isn't very effective in comp which is why he wouldn't be used/you see him not doing well. the partial invisibility is throw away as communication makes people hyper aware and a partial invisibility might as well not even exist. his only usefulness in comp is the EHP from his base 120HP+move speed+shield with a kek/crotzni which is easily outclassed by other merc's builds.  problem with phantom is the invisibility+shield and the katana right click are a synergy of low skill high reward mechanics that stomp in the confusing shit show that are 6v6->8v8 pubs or low-comm MM. you get a 108hp reward for simply being near an enemy which downs light mercs and allows you to finish off everything else (sans rhino) with a follow up left click. The frame time on the katana swings need to be reduced by a fuck-ton to give decent players an opportunity to dodge the swings, as atm the only counter is 'don't be in range of it'.  to make him viable in comp as as secondary fragger/something the engi switches to would require a rework."
Dirtybomb,3cytia,ihavelice,8,Sun Jul 12 15:09:11 2015 UTC,"Finally I want to quickly talk about his overall balance... Please try and remember that Phantom does not really do anything really well... He is not a Engineer, does not give out ammo, cannot instagib and has no medic abilities.   inb4 ""killing the entire enemy team isn't useful?""  I'm yet to see a Phantom that actually pulls their weight. It feels like a pubstomp merc through and through, and I'm still not convinced that Fragger isn't better at pubstomping than him.  He has no spam, and his real HP isn't particularly high so he does poorly against multiple targets. If he gets the element of surprise he's good against single targets, and alright against multiple targets that are distracted or bad at the game.  It's easy to get a bunch of kills and a ton of score (because of silly melee medals) as Phantom, but that doesn't actually make him useful.  His shield's damage mitigation isn't that good either. It's usually popped in a couple of headshots, and he can't shoot while he's invisible so all it means is that you need to shoot him a bit more. Fucking Rhino is more annoying to deal with than Phantom.  Yes, he's a dumb character, and annoying to both have on your team and to play against, and yes, I'd love to see him removed from the game permanently. But I just can't agree with him being actually overpowered, just inherently poorly designed and in the wrong game."
Dirtybomb,3cytia,dejecaal,8,Sun Jul 12 01:41:49 2015 UTC,"IMO the real power of Phantom is being able to get behind the front line and pick key targets. As an exemple, Phantom is a very obvious counter to Sparks: A Sparks staying in cover and reviving her teammates is a pain in the ass to deal with. But if you have a Phantom it's another story :D  He definitely has a tactical value but he's useless in a team that is unable to hold a front line."
Dirtybomb,3cytia,CaptainShaky,2,Sun Jul 12 01:55:28 2015 UTC,A phantom absorbed a MOA headshot and was left with 90% hp. I'm incredibly upset.
Dirtybomb,3cytia,Wafflepwn_syrup,5,Sun Jul 12 18:28:21 2015 UTC,"The best argument I've seen for why he has no place was someone saying that he deters new player from the game. Already the matchmaking can be very frustrating for newer players since it doesn't really do a great job of balancing the teams. With the addition of a character that can go invisible and one shot players. In high level play he is of course moderate to weak, but for those new players he can be a monster that ruins the game for them."

Dirtybomb,3cytia,CaptainShaky,2,Sun Jul 12 09:36:36 2015 UTC,A good fix to the shield would be to not have it effect his head. This will give the lower health mercs a better fighting chance while still protecting phantom from explosions or stray shots.
Dirtybomb,3cytia,sinteck,4,Sun Jul 12 08:01:18 2015 UTC,an objective look at phantom:  He can do them while invisible
Dirtybomb,3cytia,Kogath,6,Sun Jul 12 04:44:44 2015 UTC,"I just can't see how anyone can think he's balanced tbh. I know tf2 is a completely different game, but if you look at spy, who is phantom's counterpart, spy is one of the lowest hp characters, has a mediocre primary thats more of a secondary, has very, very hard counters like pyro, he can't kill out of stealth. the plus side for spy is he can disguise as enemy team members, but that's not nearly as useful as it sounds, and he's also good at taking down sentries and buildings. His movespeed is also middle of the pack.  Then you have phantom: 2nd highest effective health, can attack out of invis, one of the fastest classes in the game, no hard counters (i guess stoker/redeye will somewhat counter but I don't think it will be nearly as hard), has the strongest primary in the game  also his stealth recharge is stupid low. I don't think he should be able to melee straight out of invisiblity"
Dirtybomb,3cytia,Kogath,4,Sun Jul 12 04:49:18 2015 UTC,He also regenerates health while in stealth. I have never seen any stealth character from other games regen while stealth is active.

Dirtybomb,3cytia,Alphadef,1 point,Sun Jul 12 06:37:31 2015 UTC,Yeah just land a few headshots on that fast-moving invisible guy who can one-shot you without any aim.
Dirtybomb,3cytia,pisshead_,0,Mon Jul 13 00:49:05 2015 UTC,"If by fast you mean average speed, then yes. Also that one shot requires him to be very close to you."
Dirtybomb,3cytia,Alphadef,2,Mon Jul 13 01:28:34 2015 UTC,"Heck, look how Blacklight does it.  Its a physical item that must be equiped but has unlimited duration.  In order to attack you have to switch to another weapon and you decloak the instant you put away the item.  It makes a high risk strategy because if they spot you early, it puts you at a serious disadvantage and you have to attack from a direction they can't spot you at.  Phantom's is insanely low risk, no brainer ability as you can have a gun ready to go in cloak, gets a shield that protects you from alpha damage or anyone who spots you cloaked, and zero delays to attacking out of cloak.  People are wrecking by just yolo-bumrushing, imagine when people actually start using strategy with him."
Dirtybomb,3cytia,dutchwonder,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:22:07 2015 UTC,yeah precisely. there's very little risk for how well he works
Dirtybomb,3cytia,Kogath,1 point,Mon Jul 13 09:22:52 2015 UTC,"I see the point you're making, but a Spy's Ambassador can two shot a lot of classes. In good hands, it's pretty devastating."
Dirtybomb,3cytia,revildab,1 point,Sun Jul 12 06:08:20 2015 UTC,"sure, but a spy can't headshot someone out of cloak, only disguise. and its not a full-auto death machine like the kek-10 is."
Dirtybomb,3cytia,Kogath,-1,Mon Jul 13 09:30:16 2015 UTC,"TF2's spy and Phantom are radically different game styles. So it doesn't make any sense to compare them.  I'll still correct you on some points:   He doesn't have the 2nd highest ""effective"" health of the game. This has been debunked countless times. You do have 195 HP at the moment you cloak but it quickly goes down, even more so when you're sprinting and getting shot at. He's not one of the fastest classes in the game. He's actually pretty damn slow. (Just look at his stats in game) Fragger and Skyhammer will easily win the fight against him once he's spotted. The strongest primary in the game is the M4."
Dirtybomb,3cytia,CaptainShaky,1 point,Sun Jul 12 09:32:20 2015 UTC,"Even at half charge, he has more HP than Fragger. Hell, even 120 HP is tied for 3rd most in the game."

You do have 195 HP at the moment you cloak but it quickly goes down, even more so when you're sprinting and getting shot at.   You're right, he doesn't have the second highest effective health in the game.  He has THE highest.  150 damage headshot takes him to 120, giving him 270 health in some cases whether the cloak is drained or not."
Dirtybomb,3cytia,SteadyFrunkin,0,Sun Jul 12 10:57:57 2015 UTC,"Ok, so at worst he's probably got the 3rd highest effective health, behind fragger. His cloak is up so frequently, though, that its essentially better than health. So I'd still say he's at least the 2nd tankiest class in the game.  He's middle of the pack for speed. He's behind the super fast and the relatively fast, but ahead of the slow.   If fragger or skyhammer get caught even a little bit they're still fucked, though. He can come out of invis and ""surprise"" literally anyone with the kek-10, with instant headshots.   And the kek-10 is still one of the best, probably top 2 or 3.   And TF2 and DB aren't different enough that the comparison is unwarranted. They're more similar than you think imo, just visually very different. The main difference is DB has less difference between classes, whereas TF2 has very large differences between classes. Phantom is, IMO, the least DB-esque character in DB. He's radically different from every other merc, just like how spy is radically different from any other merc (but not how sawbonez/aura are similar to other mercs - proxy/aura very similar playstyles, one more support and the other more objective focused, then you have medic in tf2 which is completely incomparable with any other tf2 class)."
Dirtybomb,3cytia,Kogath,4,Mon Jul 13 09:28:34 2015 UTC,"My major issue with Phantom is that there is really no way to counter him or know that he's coming until it's too late. It's too easy for him to get close and kill you before you have any time to react and have a chance at killing him. In the heat of battle I can't hear footsteps that easily if at all, so I don't know when he's about to attack.  The only ways I can manage to kill him is if the person playing him is just very bad, or I see him attack someone else and can get enough shots in before he's gone."

Dirtybomb,3cytia,teteliotai,1 point,Sun Jul 12 12:07:55 2015 UTC,"Well, no one really plays competitive because of the hackers. And for the most part I don't either because it's more fun to go 8v8 than it is 5v5.  Anyways.  Phantom has an ARMOR CLOAK. Why.  Why is this a thing. Please give me a good reason why he is made to be tanky.  He is Recon. Recon are squishy... so why is he different. He should have like 100 hp, and his cloak DOESN'T defend him from bullets and explosives. Right now if I see him come around the corner at me with his cloak on, I shoot him POINT BLANK in the face with a shotgun, and it does nothing but get rid of his cloak. How is that fair? Point blank to anyone else will kill them.  Melee vs Guns. The reason THIS is unfair is right now stabbing someone kills them immediately, while guns take FOREVER to kill someone. So why should I turn the corner, see a group of people, and choose a SMG over my big knife? I mean come on, I have an armor cloak, i can take them all before they see me.  He also still has a side arm... AND a pistol.   So you give him an armor cloak, lots of health, speed, a 1 hit katana, AND an SMG AND pistol. He can kill you from a distance, and from up close. Plus he can take damage and still get away with his cloak.  Yeah, he's broken."
Dirtybomb,3cytia,GretSeat,0,Sun Jul 12 19:26:35 2015 UTC,"TLDR: Phantom is frustrating to play against for a multitude of reason but that does not make him over powered...   Being overpowered is what makes him overpowered.  Being frustrating is an entirely different argument.  Nader is frustrating to play against but you can't take the worst player in the server, give him nader and watch him top frag with zero skill or aim involved.  He's overpowered because he's head and shoulders above any other class.  He's as damaging as the most damaging classes, as fast as the fastest classes, as tanky as the tankiest classes and on top of that he's invisible and has a one shot melee weapon that requires no skill from the user.    The amount of effort to do well with a phantom is wildly disproportionate to what is required to beat him.  Also, whether or not phantom is effective at higher levels of play is irrelevant.  The skill floor on the character is FAR too high.  He allows complete garbage players to dominate games.  In CSGO, weapons like the auto shotgun and p90 have been difficult to balance despite never being viable in competitive.  That's because the skill required to use them compared to their output easily becomes out of balance.  ""He's not viable in competitive"" is not a valid argument even if the statement itself wasn't uninformed and purely speculation.    Edit:  Oh, and nothing about your post was objective.  It was all opinion and guessing.  Objective would be to compare his stats and abilities to the other classes.  If you did that, you'd see he is ""objectively"" overpowered.  That's what people mean when they say he's broken even on paper.  He both ""objectively"" broken and also broken in practice."
Dirtybomb,3cytia,SteadyFrunkin,2,Sun Jul 12 04:29:19 2015 UTC,"He's not as fast as the fastest classes (410 movespeed vs 450 and 470), and anyone with the stiletto and chopper can one shot the same classes he can.  I think he's slightly OP, but you're making some shit up."
Dirtybomb,3cytia,TwoThreeSkidoo,0,Sun Jul 12 05:07:23 2015 UTC,"I don't know if you've noticed this, but melee weapons make you run faster.  You might also notice that many phantoms tend to run around like this while also using it as their primary weapon.  This would make them faster in most combat situations."
Dirtybomb,3cytia,SteadyFrunkin,2,Sun Jul 12 06:06:04 2015 UTC,"Aura and Sparks are still faster with their primaries equipped. Proxy is faster if she has a shotgun equipped. All classes with 90 or less HP are faster with secondaries equipped. Same for melee.   Also melee doesn't give you a speed boost over your maximum speed, just lets you move at 100% of it. So basically you can just switch to your secondary and run away while shooting them, then if they decide to switch to their primary from the katana you can do the same.  Still this isn't the best solution, my original point was just that he isn't faster than every other merc like you said, and that while the katana is a bit too easy to use, it's damage is only slightly better than the stiletto (and supposedly other mercs will get the katana eventually)."
Dirtybomb,3cytia,TwoThreeSkidoo,1 point,Sun Jul 12 09:05:52 2015 UTC,"my original point was just that he isn't faster than every other merc like you said   Never said he was.  I said he was as fast as the fastest classes.  Proxy runs at 418 with a shotgun, phantom runs 410 with the sword, the difference is negligible.  You're nit-picking.  Outside of aura, sparks, and proxy, he's faster than every other class if they have their primary out.  If he's using his katana as a primary he's essentially in the fast ""tier"" of classes.  The only one who seems to be ""making some shit up"" is you."
Dirtybomb,3cytia,SteadyFrunkin,1 point,Sun Jul 12 10:52:00 2015 UTC,"Ok, scratch that. I meant he wasn't as fast as the fastest mercs like I originally said. I'm not making shit up, I'm using actual numbers. My only reason for pointing it out is because there are too many people using hyperbole when describing his OPness. Yes he is OP, but he isn't godlike like many of the circle jerkers in this sub would have people believe.  And seriously pull out your secondary and shoot him while running, he'll get scared and run away or pull out his primary and lose his shield when he fires. The only time he is really OP is when he gets the jump on you. Plenty of other classes are fast enough to get the jump and one shot the same classes as him, it just takes more skill."
Dirtybomb,3cytia,TwoThreeSkidoo,-3,Sun Jul 12 11:35:16 2015 UTC,"You can't be fucking serious about csgo?! P90 and auto shotgun never have been and never will be close to the primary weapons in csgo, from my perspective you're simply really bad at FPS, especially csgo, only people actually using p90 as a primary weapon all game is silver-gold -- from a SMFC csgo player (P90 is not as good as you state, but i guess people in lower ranks never bother learning the spray pattern for better weapons like ak, m4)  And yeah in the right hands Phantom might be good, but if you actually once in your lifetime would be able to hit the head instead of their feet, well the game would be so much easier, never had problems with Phantom, never will"
Dirtybomb,3cytia,Aphreem,-1,Sun Jul 12 05:39:39 2015 UTC,Are you completely incapable of reading?  My whole point is that the p90 and auto shotgun are not viable in competitive.  They still managed to be balance issues because their skill floor was too high.  Go re-read and try again.

Maybe useful in some really bizarre competitive play. I think that the effect from Aimee's camera blowing up is probably unintentional. It seems like what you'd expect from Thunder's concussion grenades. Red-Eye has got to be next because he counters Phantom. Red-Eye is described as having a battle rifle, so you're probably right that that new sniper is Red-Eye's marksman rifle. That LMG is Thunder's. Absolutely Thunder's. Although IMO Fragger should get it as well because the BR-16 does not fit him at all."
Dirtybomb,3cwzhz,LLAMATARIANISM,5,Sat Jul 11 15:29:54 2015 UTC,IIRC Fragger used to have that LMG and Thunder had the K121
Dirtybomb,3cwzhz,Crusadercruz,4,Sat Jul 11 16:57:41 2015 UTC,"Yes, and they switched weapons because the community was complaining about Fragger being too good at killing."
Dirtybomb,3cwzhz,kirenasura,3,Sat Jul 11 23:48:00 2015 UTC,"I don't know about the concussive part, but Aimee is supposed to be able to trigger her camera to explode for damage."
Dirtybomb,3cwzhz,SelfDefeatingChris,1 point,Sat Jul 11 17:28:39 2015 UTC,"Huh, didn't know that. There isn't much information around about Aimee; certainly not as much as there is about other mercs.  It does seem to have a concussive effect though, doesn't it? You'd think it would just go boom like any other explosive."
Dirtybomb,3cwzhz,LLAMATARIANISM,2,Sat Jul 11 17:29:46 2015 UTC,Maybe it perpertually spots people in the reigon it highlights.   If it can see you it shows your outline through walls?  i dunno.
Dirtybomb,3cwzhz,Nalrus,2,Sat Jul 11 16:48:40 2015 UTC,"The way I see it is you use it to watch a flank, just flip to it and back every once and a while, it is very hard to see when placed well.  It seems bad for solo  play but it could be useful with communication and good placement.  It probably also spots when you are in camera or maybe it spots when you aim it.  Also I really hope Red eye to be next, even without Phantoms release I have been looking forward to it.  I wonder if his M4-10 BR exicutes since its considered a Sniper rifle."
Dirtybomb,3cwzhz,Duranous,1 point,Sat Jul 11 15:52:54 2015 UTC,"Red Eye will probably replace Skyhammer for my ""general purpose damage dealer"" role. That or Thunder when he comes out. Maybe."
Dirtybomb,3cwzhz,SelfDefeatingChris,2,Sat Jul 11 17:29:44 2015 UTC,"Yah Thunder seems pretty crazy, I think concussion grenades also have a lower cool down than frags, which seems weird as they are incredibly useful.  In fact I am pretty excited about most of the new guys Stoker and Phoenix as well."
Dirtybomb,3cwzhz,Duranous,1 point,Sat Jul 11 18:09:25 2015 UTC,Why does the BR-16 not fit fragger? I wreck nerds all day with my BR-16 loadout
Dirtybomb,3cwzhz,BuckPlankMcIronStag,4,Sat Jul 11 19:04:41 2015 UTC,"I'm not knocking the gun - it has amazing DPS and is quite accurate, although the mag size is low - but it doesn't seem fitting for the frontest of front men. It's focused more towards range."
Dirtybomb,3cwzhz,LLAMATARIANISM,4,Sat Jul 11 21:22:56 2015 UTC,funny I found with the sniperrifle_03 was that depending on which class you pick changed the magazine and sights.  When you switch to proxy you load a single shotgun shet into the gun and the sights are messed.up compared to Sawbonez.  When. You are fragger it loads an ammo box instead and the sights are even worse.  Maybe the sights on the lmg are not messed up when playing as fragger?  Edit: something funny the thumbnail includes a picture of the rifle with proxies red shotgun shell clipping through the gun.
Dirtybomb,3cwzhz,Duranous,3,Sat Jul 11 15:59:27 2015 UTC,Nice to see some possibly upcoming stuff. Really excited for this game to expand it's roster :)

Dirtybomb,3cwzhz,fluency,4,Sat Jul 11 22:08:09 2015 UTC,"Nah I mean at least Red Eye has to aim and gets a huge ass smokescreen that gives his prescense away. Phatom is the opposite, doesn't have to aim shit and is invisible."

Dirtybomb,3cwzhz,fluency,2,Sun Jul 12 02:00:22 2015 UTC,He's going to be just as hated as Phantom is now with the smoke/infravision combo.    Perhaps not: IIRC the combo reveals him for retaliation as red glint through the smoke.
Dirtybomb,3cwzhz,Terr_,0,Sun Jul 12 01:18:47 2015 UTC,"Hard for me to imagine how anyone competent will spend money on, Red-Eye.  With the state of the game as it is now, his slow firing weapon is highly uncompetitive. People with fast firing SMGs will destroy you. Going to be very difficult to return fire."

Dirtybomb,3cwzhz,rollerfiesta,1 point,Sun Jul 12 00:33:59 2015 UTC,"The point of Redeye is to come behind your enemies and smoke so they cant see you, then infrared so you can see them and pop them down with a powerful battle rifle. When your smoke isnt up, you hold long range points and objectives from a distance and when it is up, you go on the aggressive in enemy territory and pop a few fools down."
Dirtybomb,3cwzhz,TemplarBean,1 point,Sun Jul 12 09:37:11 2015 UTC,"That play style does not seem fitting on linear maps, that host predominantly close quarters fighting.   This indicates they will likely dumb the game down further in future."

Dirtybomb,3cwzhz,clangclang,0,Sat Jul 11 17:10:38 2015 UTC,"IIRC long ago Aimee's cameras also ""spotted"" enemies like Vassili's heartbeat sensor, except not through walls.  That rifle definitely looks like Redeye's. The MG is probably for Thunder, yeah. As others have noted, the placeholder is probably an objective-related carryable, something more thematically-specific than the current canisters."

Dirtybomb,3d0kpp,Hutchythesmall,2,Sun Jul 12 14:27:56 2015 UTC,They should have released him before Phantom.
Dirtybomb,3d0kpp,Rusemaster1,0,Sun Jul 12 14:41:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah, either him or Stoker. I'm assuming molotovs would set him on fire when cloaked, making him visible"
Dirtybomb,3d0kpp,JustiniZHere,2,Sun Jul 12 14:45:12 2015 UTC,Do people just not know heartbeat sensors instantly uncloak Phantom? Phantom without his cloak is quite frail actually.
Dirtybomb,3d0kpp,JustiniZHere,0,Sun Jul 12 17:45:13 2015 UTC,Apparently not. Had a game today with two snipers on my team and they never threw a single sensor.  I'd still prefer Redeye though as he's got a better gun for taking him down and I don't like snipers much
Dirtybomb,3d0kpp,Nantei,2,Sun Jul 12 17:49:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah I never see Vaselines throw out sensors which is a shame, they are so damn useful and now that they decloak Phantom even more so. I only switch to him when I see 2+ Phantoms on the enemy team, I can deal with sniping enough."

Dirtybomb,3cwsg8,Amerikako,4,Sat Jul 11 15:51:12 2015 UTC,The mechanic that moves your aim up if you get hit.
Dirtybomb,3cwsg8,XohleT,7,Sat Jul 11 16:13:34 2015 UTC,So basically its flinching?
Dirtybomb,3cwsg8,Amerikako,3,Sat Jul 11 16:37:39 2015 UTC,yes
Dirtybomb,3cwsg8,XohleT,1 point,Sat Jul 11 16:49:09 2015 UTC,so basically it's realistic. No reason to take it out of the game.
Dirtybomb,3cwsg8,GretSeat,0,Sun Jul 12 19:47:49 2015 UTC,I wouldn't really give much for realism in a game. But I see no reason to take it out of the game after not even 1 week of play. Beta is a time to thoroughly test mechanics even if it might anger a portion of the community.
Dirtybomb,3cwsg8,XohleT,5,Sun Jul 12 19:53:31 2015 UTC,"It should be removed, it's not a feature that belongs in a competitive shooter with a movement system and high TTK like this one.  But it would be nice if it was at least reverted back to a less obnoxious level."
Dirtybomb,3cwsg8,Keldrath,-5,Sat Jul 11 15:12:17 2015 UTC,"It doesn't affect your movement, it just make you suffer if you don't watch your flank or don't hit most of your shots. People with great aim shouldn't be affected because they will still be able to hit more shots on the enemy causing them to feel the punch more. It's simple skilled players will adapt to check flanks more often (They should already be doing that) and bad players will learn to aim better so that even if they get hit first they will be able to hit the enemy more times to make them feel the punch worst/hardee. You are acting like the punch is so much that you do a 360 from it and it's not. If you aim at the  upper shoulder and get hit the crosshair will land on their face, if you aim at there face it will land slightly above their head, but you can correct it by pulling it down. This is how you sound (this is a different example, but the same situation) if the added recoil (the game barely has any) it would punish skilled player because they can't aim with recoil and that would reward bad player, which doesn't make sense.   The aim punch in this game is better than most game out right now. Look at CS:Go. This is just a new aspect that skill players can handle and bad player would need to learn and get better."
Dirtybomb,3cwsg8,BlackHazrd,6,Sat Jul 11 15:54:15 2015 UTC,"No, this is a mechanic that lowers the skill ceiling and raises the skill floor. It puts more emphasis and more advantage on the player landing the first shot. Bad players will still miss most of their shots, but good player vs good player it puts the advantage even more on the one that lands the first shot as he will be able to continuously keep the other players aim off balance, and if they are a good player and go for the head while being aim punched, they will miss because it will launch the shot over, and now the entire flinch animation happens in half the time it used to, so you don't even have time to compensate for it and readjust, it just jumps all over and you die because the game removed your ability to aim.  It makes the game more about who shoots first than who shoots best. That's a BAD mechanic in any FPS game. Quake is a better game than CS:GO ever was in terms of competition and skill ceiling, and it never had Flinch, and like this game it had a fast movement system and a high TTK, two things CS:GO also does not have.  Aim punch doesn't belong."
Dirtybomb,3cwsg8,Keldrath,-3,Sat Jul 11 16:07:27 2015 UTC,I still bet it won't be removed and I bet you won't get 2k people to sign this.
Dirtybomb,3cwsg8,BlackHazrd,5,Sat Jul 11 16:34:20 2015 UTC,They've already said removing it is on the table and at the very least they are going to rework it so it's not as jarring as it is now.
Dirtybomb,3cwsg8,Keldrath,0,Sat Jul 11 17:29:57 2015 UTC,"It doesn't have to be removed at all. It has to just be under the tipping point of essentially what it is right now, a PR nightmare. If you looked at the dev notes you would see that it was changed in a way that made it more difficult to manage, but it was always there; reduced frequency (higher flinch rate).  I play with shotguns the most so I do not notice it as much, but I can sympathize. Especially when I see people complaining it in game, that is unsettling in how often. If it negatively effects the player base, which it undoubtedly does, change it/remove it."
Dirtybomb,3cwsg8,omniblue,0,Sat Jul 11 20:12:17 2015 UTC,"That's what I am saying because I like aimpunch, but they should turn it down. Aim punch is a good idea and should stay in the game."
Dirtybomb,3cwsg8,BlackHazrd,2,Sun Jul 12 04:57:00 2015 UTC,"CS:GO is a game with far slower movement and a MUCH lower TTK, to the point where it's basically a preaim shooter rather than one based on straight gunfights. Dirty Bomb is really only similar in the sense that they're both FPS games. When you need as many bullets as you do in DB to get a kill, aimpunch is that much more significant."
Dirtybomb,3cwsg8,lolpierandom,0,Sat Jul 11 22:00:59 2015 UTC,But aimpunch been in the game. Asking for it to be removed is stupid when most people didn't even know it was already in the game.
Dirtybomb,3cwsg8,BlackHazrd,1 point,Sun Jul 12 05:06:57 2015 UTC,Csgo always gets brought up in aim punch arguments but it's moot. Everyone who plays csgo competitively hates it.

Dirtybomb,3cwsg8,XohleT,6,Sat Jul 11 15:05:23 2015 UTC,It's good to let them know how many people want it changed but I really thing the developers should see for them selfs if it should be changed.   We as players can't see what the developers have in store for this game and maybe a change that is looked down on now is necessary for the future.
Dirtybomb,3cwsg8,MrBogard,3,Sat Jul 11 13:54:16 2015 UTC,Nah. The gun mechanics feel worse. Should fix.
Dirtybomb,3cwsg8,XohleT,1 point,Sat Jul 11 20:59:29 2015 UTC,I think the gun mechanics in csgo is fcking awful. But some people can control recoil and spread really good so I dont see how that rng mechanic is anything less bad than aimpunch.   If you can enlighten me on that difference please do.
Dirtybomb,3cwsg8,LLAMATARIANISM,1 point,Sat Jul 11 21:52:01 2015 UTC,Recoil can be controlled very easily by pulling the mouse. Spread can be controlled very easily by bursting or tapfiring. You can not control when another person will hit you and when they will not.  Everyone just buys Kevlar anyway.
Dirtybomb,3cwsg8,MrBogard,1 point,Sun Jul 12 00:55:27 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure your comparison sheds any light on why aim punch isn't bad. If it's your opinion that random deviation is worse, that's fine, but that doesn't really speak for the quality of ""aim punch"" one way or the other.  The Phantom patch feels bad to me compared to the closed beta and the open beta launch. That has nothing to do with Counter Strike. I think it screws up a variety of encounters. And I barely notice the change when I'm Fragger. I feel it's unfairly swinging 1v1s in my favor."
Dirtybomb,3cwsg8,XohleT,1 point,Sun Jul 12 01:06:26 2015 UTC,My point is that RNG isn't necessarily bad.   I think aimpunch brings in that people need adjust aim fast and then it becomes a game of who can adjust their aim the best. It brings a new factor to the shooting game of aim tracking and trying to lose the enemies aim.
Dirtybomb,3cwsg8,MrBogard,1 point,Sun Jul 12 01:17:01 2015 UTC,"You already need to counter recoil and track movement. Aim is more highly rewarded without aim punch. Plus.. it gives first sight/hit a huge advantage, and does not effect every merc/weapon equally.  I'm legitimately surprised that anyone likes it."
Dirtybomb,3cwsg8,LLAMATARIANISM,0,Sun Jul 12 01:24:32 2015 UTC,"If the future of this game requires Phantom and aimpunch then you can bet I won't be playing Dirty Bomb in the future. I'm not gonna pretend I'm the kind of guy who's into the competitive scene and Dirtycups and all that jazz, but things like stealth, the katana and aimpunch make this game look like it's trying to be really casual, not ""the next big e-sport,"" which is the way they're advertising it. They're trying to level the playing field between good players and casual players."
Dirtybomb,3cwsg8,XohleT,-2,Sat Jul 11 15:13:43 2015 UTC,How do you know they are trying to level the playing field between good players and casual player. Did they say it them selfs or are you just assuming it.
Dirtybomb,3cwsg8,LLAMATARIANISM,7,Sat Jul 11 15:43:17 2015 UTC,"That's the entire purpose of aimpunch. It throws your aim and skill out the window because even if you can track targets well and compensate for recoil, you still have to deal constant, unpredictable jolts upwards.  And Phantom is incredibly easy to do well with because his katana can one-shot a third of all classes (""but they can backpedal away!"" you can't long-jump backwards) and hit multiple targets at once for the full 90 damage."
Dirtybomb,3cwsg8,XohleT,-2,Sat Jul 11 15:47:00 2015 UTC,SD said in a thread about phantom is that they don't wanna change panthom a lot early on because he is a new merc for the majority of the playerbase. So most of the players don't know how to play against it. Which is not a variable you want to have if you wanna balance things. Same with aimpunch (which was already there a long time just changed a bit) just let it sit a bit and see how the players adapt to it.   The game is in beta so now is a perfect time to see how people react to changes and if they need to do something or if the playerbase can adapt to it.
Dirtybomb,3cwsg8,LLAMATARIANISM,7,Sat Jul 11 15:52:05 2015 UTC,"So most of the players don't know how to play against it.   Neither stealth, nor a damage-negating shield, are new mechanics. Planetside 2, where a decent number of DB's players come from, has both. Except not in one class.  Nothing about Phantom is new to a FPS game and the ""You need to learn to counter him"" argument is a load of horsehockey.   just let it sit a bit and see how the players adapt to it.   It is completely obvious to SD that the overwhelming majority of players dislike Phantom's current state, and dislike aimpunch. There have been several polls and surveys on both. Letting it sit for even longer isn't going to do anything."
Dirtybomb,3cwsg8,Rebone1,3,Sat Jul 11 15:58:38 2015 UTC,"Neither stealth, nor a damage-negating shield, are new mechanics. Planetside 2, where a decent number of DB's players come from, has both.

Dirtybomb,3cwsg8,littlestminish,2,Sat Jul 11 16:28:03 2015 UTC,"And they nerfed it post release, if what I'm told is true."
Dirtybomb,3cwsg8,LLAMATARIANISM,2,Sat Jul 11 19:29:15 2015 UTC,"Nano-Armour Cloak lasts a very short amount of time compared to Hunter, RESISTS damage rather than absorbing it, and in Planetside has a delay when you uncloak. It isn't even comparable to Refractive Armour. Everyone uses Hunter instead because it lasts way longer.  In fact it's so bad that I forgot it existed when I wrote that :P"
Dirtybomb,3cwsg8,XohleT,-1,Sat Jul 11 21:48:24 2015 UTC,"Planetside 2, where a decent number of DB's players come from   Decent is not most and even if it isn't a new mechanic it is a new environment. Which counts for half the experience there is to a mechanic.    Letting it sit for even longer isn't going to do anything.   How do you know it isn't going to do anything. Can you look into the future do you have past experience with such situations.   Whenever in league there was a champion released people either called it OP or weak. But with a few champions they didn't do anything and after a while it suddenly became strong or not as strong. Because people could adapt to it by changing their playstyle or changing which champions they would pick against it. This could take sometimes days,weeks maybe a month but it happened so why would they have to nerf the merc right away after not even a week of play if they don't totally know if the merc is even OP."
Dirtybomb,3cwsg8,LLAMATARIANISM,2,Sat Jul 11 16:11:30 2015 UTC,Planetside was just one example. There are plenty of other games with shields or cloaks that are actually balanced.  Did letting the plasma rifle stay in the game for 3 months help T:A?
Dirtybomb,3cwsg8,BlackHazrd,-10,Sat Jul 11 16:16:18 2015 UTC,He is mad that now you have to develop positioning skills and control your aim better.
Dirtybomb,3cwsg8,LLAMATARIANISM,6,Sat Jul 11 15:46:45 2015 UTC,I'm mad that you're using downvotes to kill discussion. Other than that I'm perfectly calm.  Aimpunch does not translate to controlling your aim because it is completely unpredictable. You can't predict when the enemy will and won't hit you and therefore it can't be compensated for. Saying that aimpunch increases the need for good aim is the same as saying that horizontal shake does.

Now I didn't down vote and I would like you to spot lying to make your case.  Now think about it this way a player that sucks at aiming get the drop on a skilled player. The bad player shoots 5 shots and only hit one, the skilled players turns around and hits 4 shots and they continue the fight who is going to win. The bad player did get the drop on the skill player and the skill player got the punch first, but who will end up winning that gun fight."

Dirtybomb,3cwsg8,BlackHazrd,-4,Sat Jul 11 15:51:44 2015 UTC,"It doesn't affect your movement, it just make you suffer if you don't watch your flank or don't hit most of your shots. People with great aim shouldn't be affected because they will still be able to hit more shots on the enemy causing them to feel the punch more. It's simple skilled players will adapt to check flanks more often (They should already be doing that) and bad players will learn to aim better so that even if they get hit first they will be able to hit the enemy more times to make them feel the punch worst/hardee. You are acting like the punch is so much that you do a 360 from it and it's not. If you aim at the upper shoulder and get hit the crosshair will land on their face, if you aim at there face it will land slightly above their head, but you can correct it by pulling it down. This is how you sound (this is a different example, but the same situation) if the added recoil (the game barely has any) it would punish skilled player because they can't aim with recoil and that would reward bad player, which doesn't make sense. The aim punch in this game is better than most game out right now. Look at CS:Go. This is just a new aspect that skill players can handle and bad player would need to learn and get better."
Dirtybomb,3cwsg8,stennnn,1 point,Sat Jul 11 15:59:04 2015 UTC,"You are completly wrong. The aimpunch in fps games is normal, obviously. I think nobody disagrees with the aimpunch itself but the thing we wanna change is the way it's right now, it's hard to play, especially with mercs with rifles. Atm, SMGs have bigger aimpunch than the rifles, which shouldn't happen. A situation that I saw several times is: Imagine a fragger shooting at a bushwhacker and he almost gets no aimpunch. Suddently, he hits you one shot, and your crosshair goes up in the sky, and makes it almost impossible to control your recoil.  This has been changed in the past update, and we want to reverse this process."

Do some reading, considering you seem to post a lot about this it would be good to understand it."

What I am saying is getting rid of it is stupid and they won't do it. Turn down the settings maybe, but they have said it themself they won't remove it. Yes you can bring down the punch when it happens and that's why I compared it to recoil. You can play with recoil and the fact the some recoil patterns may be crazy doesn't mean you should remove recoil from the game. In CS:GO if you don't play comp and only deathmatch where you can't buy the vest and helmet it is no longer an economy function and that's why I bring the point up."

I know, it's shitty to just rant, but I took the time to share because I want to have a meaningful dialogue with this community, and this was the best way I could. So before you dismiss it outright, read it through, just once?"
Dirtybomb,3czo58,Hoshiyuu,2,Sun Jul 12 06:14:05 2015 UTC,"I am sitting on my hands here, so I'll entertain you.    Alright. I'm going to preface this with the fact that, of course, all of the following is my own opinion, and I make no claim to speak for anyone but myself. I've also got every reason to believe that I might be downvoted to hell over this,   Lengthy pointless preface that points out the oblivious that a thread started by you is in fact, your comment. Also, saying ""I might get downvoted for this"" is basically the easiest way to get downvoted.   so, here's hoping I can at least make it clear that I'm not pushing an agenda. I'll be absolutely clear. I do not own, nor do I play, Phantom. I have no stake in him as a merc.   Your stake in him is you play characters that are threatened by him, playing a game that contains Phantom.   My mains, at the moment, are Aura and Proxy, with a side of something like Nader. So now that we're clear, I feel the need to say this: I don't mind playing against Phantom. In fact, I'll go one step further. I enjoy playing against Phantom. I've been playing Dirty Bomb for about a month now, having arrived some time just prior to the Kira/Rhino update. At first? I thought Rhino was a menace. I hated facing one. And I couldn't possibly stand it when another team went two, three Rhinos at a time. But guess what? I had to play against him, and I did. And then, I started winning. I found strategies. I, as a player, adapted to a new challenge. And now, I couldn't care less about a Rhino. He's one more merc that takes some careful handling, but by playing fast classes, I know my personal tactic is to stay behind him, kite, and shoot for the head. It works, I enjoy it, and taking down an enemy Rhino feel satisfying. It feels like it takes skill, but if I handle the situation correctly, I'm rewarded.   Rhino has obvious strength and weakness. Tanky, insane close quarter DPS, very potent defender when a medic is on top of him, the ""Heavy"" of Dirty Bomb. He is susceptible to fast characters, and snipers. head shot is incredibly easily to land when Rhino is in his strongest form.  Phantom only ""weakness"" is that he could not directly support his teammate through kits and objectives. This is subjective, as one could argue that butchering the entire enemy team is as good as any support to a team. As a stealth archetype, he has no right to own both stealth, speed, and raw HP. Having the strongest weapon in his weapon group and melee able to one shot most common classes that hits everyone in a long window is unheard of in any other competitive games. Most melee weapon only have a small window of active hitbox.   What's that got to do with Phantom? Pretty obvious. I'm excited, and thrilled, to have a new challenge in the community. I've played a lot of games that featured cloaking (Blacklight, Team Fortress 2, and Killing Floor, just to name a few),   Blacklight enables cloak for movement, disable weapons and offensive capabilities. Does not grant extended survival capabilities. Very limited in usage except niche movement cases.  Spy in TF2 disable offensive capabilities, requires lengthy and loud fade in and fade out, cost extremely good map knowledge to maintain a healthy amount of cloak energy, bumping into things reveals you slightly, requires backstab to score kills in a high paced game, mediocre movement speed, and piss poor ranged options - because he is not designed to win a 1v1 face-to-face duel.   Killing Floor, last I checked, the only thing that could go invisible is the boss healing method, which can be countered by locking down path and forcing the invisible boss to go exactly where you want him to go. This is a moot point and does not contribute to the invisible discussion.   so maybe I'm adjusted to it? But a Phantom who's moving is absolutely visible, if you know what to look for. And even better? Every time I shoot a cloaked Phantom creeping towards our rear? I inevitably draw attention to him, and get team support.   Most public players wouldn't even notice a dead Medic lying down behind them, expecting people to take notice because you shot at something from their back is like a far-fetched thought.   Hell, particularly with a shotgun loadout Aura, I'd say Phantom is far and away one of the more straightforward kills to land. I'd certainly take him over a Fragger 1v1 any day.   Aura's speed and shotgun makes her a reasonable fight against Fragger. Phantom one shots you when you are reviving someone or just not paying attention.   But more than arguing about whether or not he's a killable merc,   Again, stealth and tank in one single ability.   I'd like to address my feelings about the community reaction to him. Ever since I picked up the game, I've been lurking this subreddit, and loving the support, diversity, and discussion that's been here. Sure, there was the occassional complaint, and often some warranted critique. But they always felt like they came in the spirit of suggestion, and as a means of making the game better. Right now? I can't fucking stand it here. I'm sorry.    If you don't like the Internet, you can walk away from it. You are free to walk away from dialogue you don't enjoy, but don't try to expect self-censorship from others just because your opinion differs.   I think the community has reacted outrageously to a game that is still very clearly in development. Between complaints and demands to the devs, it feels like an number of threads are just here to bitch, rehashing the same arguments, and frankly? Whining about a merc before they've ever taken the time try and find a counter strategy. Let me be clear. I think Dirty Bomb needs some tweaking. I think aimpunch was a well ment but poorly implemented inclusion. I, again, don't mind adjusting my play style to it, but I'd say that much more clearly deserves attention from the devs, particularly in a competitive scene. But I think the Phantom hate and a lot of the parroting makes this community go from supportive and suggestive to toxic and combative, and that's really, really something I'd hope we can avoid. Dirty Bomb is fun, dammit, and the developers have, even in the middle of this shitstorm, taken the time to be both polite and interactive despite a lot of backlash. Yes, the should be aware of balance issues and complaints. But I think given the reactions they've faced? They have handled things, barring a few decent hiccups, rather gracefully. Long story short? I care. I care about this community, the game, and its future. And as a lurker, it feels weird to be moved to much by the reactions here that I take the time to finally write this, but it's been on my mind for a few days now. And yes, I'm happy to see that things seem to be, at least for the most part, returning to normal. Some part of this, of course, is playing devil's advocate, but I honestly think the best way to develop an honest and open rapport is through discussion. So please, instead of arguing, or flipping out, or losing it over a freshly implemented merc that's barely been playtested yet, can we just take it all back a notch and just talk? Because I know, deep down, every person that rants, that gets upset, and that posts here? Only does so because they care about the game, and want it to be the best it can be. Well, so do I. So let's make it happen.   Like a broken record, you manage to communicate a simple idea of ""Be fair, be nice, don't over react, try to accept that idea of Phantom perhaps is not as broken as you might think, lets try to work towards a great game together"" in the worst possible way.  I've read your lengthy piece, and I am open for further discussion."

Dirtybomb,3czo58,negbot1,1 point,Sun Jul 12 14:32:18 2015 UTC,"If you don't like the reddit, then don't read it? You're bitching about other people bitching about Phantom, which is even more useless than bitching about Phantom.   Your single, anecdotal experience is not as absolutely indicative of the state of Phantom as you'd seem to like to believe I think. Did you consider that, perhaps, the reason everyone is complaining is because there is genuinely a major issue that is being experienced almost universally, and that this reddit isn't simply a mindless hivemind that likes to complain?  Phantom is stupid. Here are some reasons why.  -Access to the best smg  -Exceptionally tanky  -Has a shield on stealth, which can even tank explosives and sniper shots  -Albeit visible, he is extremely hard to track, especially when watching other players/projectiles/HUD/objectives/etc.  -Can 1 shot kill, out of stealth, in an AoE  -Can stealth and unstealth nearly instantly  -Has decent move speed  I'm sure there is more too. Certainly there is no issue with this character, when I can headshot him with a sniper and he takes no damage, or when he waits in a corner and immediately kills me as a large portion of the characters. As he stands the character has far too much power, they basically just gave him everything and then added stealth. That is stupid unbalanced. Checking my back every few seconds in hopes of catching him before he obliterates me is not fun, the only thing less fun is catching him, unloading a full clip into his chest and head, and then immediately dieing to a single lunge attack before he stealths away (or, as he often does, kills my teamates and then stealths away)."
Dirtybomb,3czo58,haunebu_wolf,0,Sun Jul 12 09:09:20 2015 UTC,"Oh, I completely agree that there's a balance issue with Phantom, and you're absolutely right, I can just stop reading. But, like I said, I really genuinely care about the community.   Honestly, yes, as he stands, he needs to be reworked. My post isn't really there to argue for or against changes to Phantom as a character mechanically. Hell, I think you made some perfectly solid points.  I was moreso hoping to address what I've seen as a real spike in hostility in the community, and a massive angry blowback that, frankly? Damages inter-player relationships, and hurts both this sub and its relationship with the Splash Damage devs. I appreciate you commenting, even if you completely disagree with me. I will say that your anecdotal experience has no more or less weight than my own, but I'm still happy to see it shared and realize that it's valuable feedback in its own way."
Dirtybomb,3czo58,wrench_nz,1 point,Sun Jul 12 09:21:17 2015 UTC,"My experience is similar to the experience of hundreds of others, who have made their experiences and opinions known on this reddit.  If you acknowledge the balance issue, then it should be quite apparent why the community here is 'angry'. The devs released an OP character that clearly wasn't tested to any meaningful extent which makes the game feel frustrating, unfair, and far less enjoyable, AND they aren't going to hot fix it so we just get to tough it out for all they care (as they have acknowledged the issues and uproar), AND they have a full ingame shop where you can purchase this OP hero.  I think it's just frustration for the game being transmitted into frustrated posts about the game. Personally I think it's pretty stupid that they have implements a nice, polished, ingame store and case system, and are perfectly happy to accept cash when they can't even release a new character properly.   I was around in closed beta forever ago and just started playing again, honestly the biggest difference they've made that I can see is in the UI and shop/loadout/case system. Hell, they even had redeye, thunder, phoenix, and stoker all completely playable and balanced, and the game feels almost exactly the same as then. I come back like a year or two later and the game has LESS characters, MORE imbalance, yet they managed to slip in the cash shop. Their priorities are part of the frustration, for me at least."
Dirtybomb,3czo58,Alphadef,0,Sun Jul 12 09:33:51 2015 UTC,"Okay, the discussion of priorities really makes sense to me. The problem with Phantom isn't just that they introduced a broken merc, but that they did so and refuse to fix it, all the while profiting from it and setting the progress of the entire game's development back to do it. Completely and utterly understandable, and worthy of outrage. Consider me swayed."
Dirtybomb,3czo58,SC2_Bench,1 point,Sun Jul 12 14:25:20 2015 UTC,"Even releasing such a broken merc is somewhat unacceptable at this time. Maybe I'm just a little entitled, but the game has been in development and some form of beta for a very long time now and they've been 'balancing' characters all this time with very little change from what I can see. There is no god explanation for phantom. Either the devs are incompetent and didn't bother testing him/don't even play their own game, or they knew he was OP and released him anyways so that people would buy him. He is either a result of laziness or blatant profit."
Dirtybomb,3czo58,Wafflepwn_syrup,1 point,Sun Jul 12 17:39:52 2015 UTC,"Instead of Phantom, DB should make merc which can steal enemy uniforms, just like good old covert ops from ET. No invisibility, no shield, maybe some exclusive melee for backstabbing."

Dirtybomb,3d1zmh,Decem8,-2,Sun Jul 12 21:51:25 2015 UTC,The cloak absorbs damage because he still remains visible. Removing the shield and making him squishier would mean he either needs full invibility or complete unviability.

Dirtybomb,3d0oq4,TheSacredGamer1,2,Sun Jul 12 15:09:17 2015 UTC,"Was going to give you constructive criticism but I realized you don't really deserve it do you? This clearly isn't really a review. You just lazily streamed yourself playing a match and uploaded it. For a review, you offer literally no insight or information about Sparks at all. It's just you playing piss poorly with your friends. Yeah you got a handful of kills, but you were a terrible medic. It's not until three and a half minutes in that you throw a teammate a med pack. Seriously? Even worse, you don't revive anybody UNTIL 6 MINUTES AND 45 SECONDS INTO THE GAME. Are you kidding me?   On top of all that, you don't even know how Sparks works. Several times throughout the video you complain that you ran out of ammo, completely oblivious to the fact that your best weapon has unlimited ammo.Her Med-Gun is her most powerful weapon. It can kill people faster and easier than her machine gun.  You don't use it once. Yep, I'm not kidding.   If you had titled this video as your first impressions on Sparks I would give you a pass. I would just downvote and move on. But you had the audacity to call this a review.  My advice to you is to avoid the medic classes altogether. You really seem to like to kill people so pick a class that is suited to your strengths.  If you actually insist on making more ""reviews"" on the other medic classes, make videos where you're actually healing and reviving people rather than running in on the front lines trying to be a combat class."

There's another one with KEK-10 and Drilled which used to be good and it was pretty much a toss up between the two, but since the last patch the meta changed to Focus or trash.  Helps that it's also got faster lock on for turrets and spares, but Focus+KEK-10 is what makes it the best.  Focus is a requirement for any loadout, it's Battle Hardened all over again, except not everyone can get it."

Dirtybomb,3d1m5m,Timatora,7,Sun Jul 12 19:55:14 2015 UTC,I feel it would be best to make him a medium-light class. After his initial pick he'll be really vulnerable. He'd be more of a pick class that'll have to choose his targets intelligently.
Dirtybomb,3d1m5m,Spannzer,2,Sun Jul 12 20:06:57 2015 UTC,"That's... sort of exactly how he plays now. In what world do you live where he's not vulnerable after opening up on a group of people? It's the major reason he won't be picked in tournament play. He has poor gibbing power, offers nothing against a group of people that other mercs don't, and his only real boon is that he can one-shot mercs that nobody picks in tournament play because they are already sub-par. As a tourney player, why would you ever pick a Phantom over a Nader, Vassili, or extra Bushwhacker?"
Dirtybomb,3d1m5m,Nantei,3,Sun Jul 12 23:17:13 2015 UTC,"Depends on the map and what merc composition the opponent is using.    I dont struggle to kill him   Tell me, let's say you play as a fragger and Phantom has snuck up behind you. He hits you one time and now you have a second to react before he hits you again, how do you deal with him? You can't outrun him, you can't outgun him since you're down to less that 50% of your health. There is literally no way to survive if he is behind you."
Dirtybomb,3d1m5m,Rusemaster1,0,Sun Jul 12 20:29:30 2015 UTC,No different that any merc with a Ramberg shotty coming up behind you really.  I dont really play as fragger but as a Bushwhacker im able to get a few hits in to down his cloak. keep jumping and getting away and aim for the head. I'd say I win 4/5 times. Its the same as someone running around with a bat.   As for people coming up behind me. I usually hear them and dont let it happen. All in the positioning
Dirtybomb,3d1m5m,Rusemaster1,3,Sun Jul 12 20:44:17 2015 UTC,"No different that any merc with a Ramberg shotty coming up behind you really.   No other merc has a cloaking device. If another merc manages to flank you, he deserves the kill. Phantom gets free flanking. Good luck hearing Phantom when there are 5 airstrikes, 40 nades, 2 lasers going off at the same time."

I don't wanna waste half my Crotni mag to take it out and run short of bullets to kill him, that really sucks. With perfect aim you can kill him with one mag, but please, hes an invisible dude runing and jumpin to you, it's kinda hard to headshot him 100% of the time. I like the aspect on him tanking airstrikes or a nade, surviving a proxy mine or a Vass headshot, but tanking that mani shots imo makes no sense.

Dirtybomb,3cxaxb,Keldrath,1 point,Sat Jul 11 19:52:19 2015 UTC,"I can't agree with your reasoning for including it in the game. You don't need it to notice you are getting hit, most low aim players don't even notice it's there at all until it's pointed out to them. The thing that really confuses me is why you want it there to give the person who gets the first shot a bigger advantage. Why would you want to give them even more of an advantage? You know they already have a large advantage to begin with, without adding in aim punch to it. Adding it only detracts from the impact of having good aim in the first place.  Why wouldn't you want good aim to be rewarded? Why would you want it to have less impact? That doesn't make a lot of sense for an FPS, especially one that wants to be competitive.  That said, I'm glad you guys are at least willing to tweak it so it's not so jarring and doesn't impact us in as negative a way as it is currently. I only hope these tweaks come sooner rather than later."
Dirtybomb,3cxaxb,Exayex,1 point,Sat Jul 11 20:03:17 2015 UTC,"I would think you'd just go back to the way it was before the Phantom patch, in regards to aim punch. That really was as much aim punch as the game should have, and even then, less would be better.   If you're so convinced aim punched is necessary, even after the recent polls and petition suggesting otherwise, maybe you guys are developing the wrong game.  Maybe you guys could get the next Call of Duty?   But hey, keep shooting yourself in the foot.  You guys and Psyonix (Nosgoth) and Adhesive (Hawken) can get together and discuss how to build a fantastic game then kill then it off within three years by having some shitty ""vision"" for the game."

Dirtybomb,3cxaxb,omniblue,3,Sat Jul 11 17:49:47 2015 UTC,"Its way worse then it was before. The Dev numbers makes the case against aim punch that much more severe, the tipping point.

His turret is not overpowered but makes a great defensive talent. You can hide behind it to soak bullets while you both shoot back, you can set it up on blind corners, use it to watch your back, use it to make a crossfire trap so they don't know who to shoot at... Etc. Great tool.  The buskwacker kek is also a great gun  Only a handful of my kills per match come from the turret itself, but the distress and confusion it can cause when used properly is what makes bushwacker a very hearty class."
Dirtybomb,3cy2da,Doom721,4,Sun Jul 12 01:19:31 2015 UTC,"Nader is very solid if you are looking to just outright kill, because grenades, martyrdom and a decent SMG go a long way in terms of combat capability.  Bushwhacker is definitely a top dog too, unlike fletcher's nades and proxys mines..... the turret placed in the right place can cover an area temporarily - and his weapon being the heavy style KEK on some loadouts leads to him being a fierce combat class to deal with.  Oddly enough, I don't have a decent fragger loadout with the LMG so I don't like him even though I got a BR16 loadout, the burst rifle feels lacking with the class.  Sawbones, with the same types of guns as Bushwhacker is a GREAT medic because he has high damage, bit of health, and is the best direct-heal medic in the game. He can heal someone with a duffle bag then LEAVE to engage enemies. Hes versatile, and much like his description he heals with one hand, and kills with the other.  I don't have Kira yet, I've been playing a lot of Phantom but I'm sure you've heard everything. Fletcher is lackluster to me personally, some people are good with him but I feel like unless you are REALLY good with the shotguns and timing the sticky nades, that proxy or bushwhacker is the better objective class due to mine utility and bushwhackers utility turret/KEK10."

Alternatively, my rankings: Assault/Killing: Vasili (Provided you're insanely good at him, most people aren't), Fragger, Phantom, Nader, Rhino  Medics: Sawbonez, Sparks, Aura  Engineers: Bushwhacker, Proxy, Fletcher  Fire Supports: Skyhammer, Kira, Arty  Ultimately, considering you can get fragger for free, I'd say Bushwhacker would be your best bet."

Your team needs help with suppressive fire? Just join them and fire away,. Your team is getting wrecked? Easy peasy...just  drop med packs and you're contributing to the team to not get ur squad killed. You can also revive k/o'd players too which is very nice.    GET Proxy. Medic with I think 100hp, stupid fast, Can Wield Shotguns and SMGS IN ONE LOADOUT (very very useful for mid range and close combat).You has mines that can be placed near choke points (like hallways,alleyways near the objective) which is effective for creating a sense of security in your objectives.

Dirtybomb,3cy2da,prodiG,1 point,Sun Jul 12 03:08:06 2015 UTC,Ill surely give a go to Bushwaker! Everyone is suggesting him :)
Dirtybomb,3cy2da,Qdin,1 point,Sun Jul 12 03:09:00 2015 UTC,"I'd say Sawbonez or Bushwhacker, best medic and eng in their class IMO(although Proxy isnt too bad at all for 30k). Rhino and Fletcher are good for if you love combat or can't be bothered helping people all the time."
Dirtybomb,3cy2da,Busdriverx,1 point,Sun Jul 12 05:48:26 2015 UTC,"I strongly believe Sawbonez, Fragger and Bushwhacker are the best mercs in the game right now. Any of them are good picks."
Dirtybomb,3cy2da,omniblue,1 point,Sun Jul 12 06:33:56 2015 UTC,"when thinking that Fletcher was solid enough to keep him in my squad all the time?   I have all the mercs unlocked. Played some Phantom other day, came to the conclusion that he is far less fun than Fletcher. Same applies to all the mercs, I play them, they can be fun but Fletcher is always fun, always useful and the only merc I always keep in the squad. If I had to pick one, be him without a second thought. So much fun to play."

Dirtybomb,3cyos3,Nantei,3,Sun Jul 12 12:50:09 2015 UTC,"Yes, it should be narrowed down to 30 degrees. I wholly support this change, mostly because it's not a change because it already is at 30 degrees. The issue is just hitboxes because even if it allows full control, hitbox for melee is supposed to be limited to the initial attack angle. This works with every melee weapon, Phantom just has a longer animation/reach that illustrates the problem far more clearly. In the meantime, though, RIP IT UP!"
Dirtybomb,3cyos3,novel__,1 point,Sat Jul 11 23:57:54 2015 UTC,agreed! His freedom of motion gives him too much of a chance to strike his opponent after committing to a heavy attack without penalty.
Dirtybomb,3cyos3,prodiG,2,Sun Jul 12 00:07:41 2015 UTC,"I personally don't understand why the heavy attack, the stab, has so much duration anyway.  It should be a quick thrust, not holding the katana out like a retard and somehow killing five people with almost no force."

Dirtybomb,3cxa9l,Darkhoon,11,Sat Jul 11 16:26:38 2015 UTC,"Since nobody else mentioned it: you can buy specific loadout cards in the store for 17,500 credits. Unless you're lucky, this is cheaper than opening cases and trading up and takes the RNG out of getting loadouts. I recommend buying these once you've got the mercs you want."
Dirtybomb,3cxa9l,Fire42uck,14,Sat Jul 11 18:43:19 2015 UTC,"Save up for heroes - you get cases by playing, but heroes are pretty expensive. Once you've been through a few free rotations, you'll know which heroes you want to buy and also have enough credits to buy them. You'll get enough cases just playing to get a decent number of loadout cards. You can also buy the loadout card you want directly (again, once you have the heroes you want)."
Dirtybomb,3cxa9l,WyMANderly,4,Sat Jul 11 16:30:11 2015 UTC,And what are those loadout cards? Sorry I'm really new :D
Dirtybomb,3cxa9l,WyMANderly,11,Sat Jul 11 16:31:31 2015 UTC,"Loadout cards are what determine your weapons and perks ingame. They go from Lead to Iron to Bronze in power - you get 1, 2, or 3 perks (which are minor boosts in power, like 20% more melee damage or something). There are card rarities above Bronze, but they're all exactly as powerful as Bronze, just cooler looking outfits/guns. You'll eventually want Bronze cards for everyone you play, but the advantages are small enough that you can still be competitive before you have them."

Dirtybomb,3cxa9l,Fire42uck,3,Sat Jul 11 16:38:45 2015 UTC,"Loadout cards are the things you can get out of cases. They change what weapons your merc uses and also give perks.   Lead gives 1 perk, iron 2, and bronze gives 3. Anything above bronze is essentially the same as a bronze loadout but have different skins on the hero and weapon.  You can trade up lead -> iron, iron -> bronze and so on and so forth.  Its best to just stack a lot or bronze loadouts to begin with unless you are really interested in skins and then you can trade up higher if you want."
Dirtybomb,3cxa9l,terrankazuma,2,Sat Jul 11 16:38:03 2015 UTC,"Oh, that's cool. So is there anything I can't get without real money btw? And my last question is how often does the free rotation change? Thanks again :)"
Dirtybomb,3cxa9l,rdmarshman,3,Sat Jul 11 16:48:11 2015 UTC,"Free rotation changes every two weeks on a Wednesday. The current rotation will end next Wednesday.   The things that are only for cash are boosters and elite cases. Elite cases are like regular cases, but they only drop silver, gold, and cobalt loadout cards."
Dirtybomb,3cxa9l,rdmarshman,2,Sat Jul 11 18:41:41 2015 UTC,"Technically, the only things AFAIK that you NEED real money for are credit boosters and elite cases. Credit boosters double the base credits for the game and only tick down when you're playing, and Elite Cases are cases that drop only silver or better cards. Technically, you can also get these cards by trading up, but it skips the grind up to that point"
Dirtybomb,3cxa9l,TeaL3af,2,Sat Jul 11 17:46:50 2015 UTC,"Even then, the elite cases are useless - there's only as many loadouts as there are on the store page. I found this out the hard way, chasing the 'perfect' card. It didn't exist."
Dirtybomb,3cxa9l,A_GodDamnGoose,3,Sun Jul 12 04:53:44 2015 UTC,You can get everything in the game so far without real money.    It's just grindy.
Dirtybomb,3cxa9l,Rionstainer,3,Sat Jul 11 16:56:44 2015 UTC,"This is good advice. In addition, if you think you eventually might spend cash on the game I'd recommend checking out which mercs come as part of a bundle in the cash shop before spending credits on one. I bought proxy with Credits but later really wanted to buy Bushwacker and Sawbones. There's a bundle with Proxy, Bushwacker and Sawbones so it was a bit of a waste."
Dirtybomb,3cxa9l,SelfDefeatingChris,2,Sat Jul 11 19:28:42 2015 UTC,"Imo that's the best bundle, my favorite medic class, and my two favorite engi classes. It's also cheaper than the other two, only 15$."

Dirtybomb,3cxa9l,Rusemaster1,2,Sat Jul 11 18:54:37 2015 UTC,"OP as far as mercs are concerned (because I agree that you should save up for them) If you want a medic go with Sawbonez, Bushwacker and Proxy are both great Engineers, and for taking the fight to the enemy Skyhammer (which you already have unlocked) and Fragger are excellent."
Dirtybomb,3cxa9l,GT_Frost,2,Sat Jul 11 20:09:22 2015 UTC,"Save all credits for mercs, you can trade up the thousand and one led loadout cards you will accumulate over time for new loadout cards and cases drop quite generously after games.

Dirtybomb,3cxa9l,GT_Frost,2,Sat Jul 11 23:44:46 2015 UTC,you'll get to a point in the game where cases are the only thing can buy. I usually have 50k on standby for new mercs and spend the rest on cases.

It would also just allow the hacker to bring a friend to avoid having votes go through. Or like the people from the TF2 hack, I forget the name, bringing 5 deep of hackers into comp.  And it's fairly easy to tell that the guy getting nutsy shots is just a great player but the guy who lands consecutive headshots on multiple players in one spray, consistently, is a hacker.   Subtle hackers are annoying, since maybe you lost to a guy who using no recoil, no spread, light aim assist, or a trigger configured to not work perfectly every time  giving him an advantage that you can't really see and is generally hard to spot as cheating rather than just player skill. These guys are the ones that require solid video evidence and investigation and probably wouldn't get vote kicked.  But then there is the guy who goes all out, uses everything the cheat kit he gets has. Aimbots your whole team, making it quite clear that he's cheating. Never misses any shots no matter the range, prefires perfectly every time, countersnipes with an SMG-9 while jumping in the middle of a fire lane, etc. These guys are easy to spot, and I shouldn't be punished for not wanting to play with them."

Dirtybomb,3cxqfv,trotsky187,20,Sat Jul 11 18:47:42 2015 UTC,"Aim kick was something RTCW players and W:ET players had to deal with and it was NEVER complained about. There was NEVER a situation where worse players were being constantly rewarded for getting the first shot in (an argument presented as tho this is some kind of ""bad play"", which is obviously simply not true)   If I remember it correctly, the aimkick in ET is very different from the one used in DB. In ET, it moved your camera, but your bullets still go to the old position potentially allowing you to deal 3 HS under fire, if you are tracking horizontally correct. If you knew where you were aiming at before getting hit, you had a good chance to deal equal or more amounts of damage. The skill required was to be able to aim half blind. If you accidentally move your aim, you will still deal damage as you are shooting at the body.  In DB, your bullets will always go where your crosshair is pointing at, thus it potentially requires you to constantly fix the vertical position of the crosshair, something you did not have to do in ET.  I assume the 'bad' situation is when you stop hitting the enemy instead of giving him headshots because your aim moved upwards. I assume that the skill required here is to aim at the lower end of the head or on the chest when the enemy returns fire to hopefully do headshots when not hit and hopefully keep hitting headshots when getting hit."

Dirtybomb,3cxqfv,Microchaton,5,Sat Jul 11 22:15:10 2015 UTC,"""do like in ET"" is in general a bad suggestion because a game designer does not necessarily learn from that. You need to show up the differences in the design and the implications of each implementation. Then, the other designer has enough insights to decide what might be better regarding the overall design philosophy of the particular game.  SD's staff should be able to act professionally enough to not blindly copy ET, but to be able to make reasonable decisions for their desired gameplay (which should always come first, screw realism)."

Dirtybomb,3cxqfv,CaptainShaky,-4,Sat Jul 11 20:19:17 2015 UTC,"Sorry mate but in any FPS ever that has been competitive, it has almost NEVER been top aim that has won the day, and this fact is stressed 10 fold in objective based team games like the ones splash damage puts out. There is very little difference in aim between top players in any FPS and the thing that seperates them is better teamwork, communication and positional and situational awareness. The best Quake player of the past decade (Rapha) was not an aiming god but a guy who had the most amazing map control and situational awareness. There were 3 or 4 guys who were CLEARLY better aimers than him but he still rekt everybody. And that was a game with 200hp and 100 armour when stacked. I could give several examples in ET and RTCW where this was true in terms of clans as well.   What I am saying is that at the top level there is a level of aim that always ""gets the job done"" and where making improvements only makes a minor difference in relative damage output between the two players.  Mathematically this is easily provable. A player hitting 20% accuracy does roughly half the damage of a player at 40% accuracy. At the top level let's say the least talented ""top player"" hits 40% and the most talented ""top player"" hits 45%. This is only a relative difference of 12.5%.  At that point team and individual success is more about situational awareness and positioning. This is the factor that seperates the best players. Even the best aimers are never ""aimbots"" they cannot turn 4 times in 2 seconds and kill 5 different people. It's just impossible for a human to do that."
Dirtybomb,3cxqfv,Arg0ms,-7,Sat Jul 11 22:30:06 2015 UTC,I don't know how it's difficult to understand. If you played a top level in any clan in any FPS you would understand what I am talking about. You don't so I can't really get into discussion with you. Sorry mate.

Dirtybomb,3cxqfv,dejecaal,2,Sat Jul 11 23:02:40 2015 UTC,"How do you define 'very well'? The very best aimers in the world aren't all in top 5 teams because aim isn't the only important thing, but none of them will ever be in a position where they can't get a salaried team unless they deliberately put themselves in one. The absolute worst pro is better than the average guy can even comprehend."
Dirtybomb,3cxqfv,CaptainShaky,1 point,Sat Jul 11 23:37:43 2015 UTC,It was a rhetoric question. All top players aim very well. Good aim IS important in FPS games. Remember what the S stands for in FPS ?
Dirtybomb,3cxqfv,dejecaal,2,Sun Jul 12 00:08:01 2015 UTC,"Way to not understand the argument here. Good aim is part of being a good player, but ultimately the games aren't won with aim, but strategy. Aim plays a part in executing that strategy, but it's far from being the most important element. This goes or both Counter-Strike and Dirty Bomb and most every other FPS I've played.  Ergo, the games aren't primarily about aim."
Dirtybomb,3cxqfv,CaptainShaky,1 point,Sun Jul 12 00:54:46 2015 UTC,"In DB's strategy, you should be able to assume a Fragger can kill a Nader in 1v1. That's logic: Fragger is a killing machine and nader is an aera denier. Well with aimpunch I've actually lost 1v1s against Naders because their higher RoF with the SMGs give them an advantage thanks to aimpunch.  Get how aim, and therefore aimpunch too, are fucking with DB's strategy ?"
Dirtybomb,3cxqfv,dejecaal,1 point,Sun Jul 12 01:38:46 2015 UTC,"Or maybe, get this, the Nader just either  1) outaimed you plain and simple  2) got a streak of lucky headshots  I've lost duels to fucking Sparks as Fragger. It happens. They surprise you, or you just aim particularly bad, or just can't hit them for some reason despite feeling like you're aiming fine. You can't expect to win every duel 100% of the time just because you're playing a class with 30 more HP and a weapon that's slightly more accurate to medium and long ranges.  But since it's much easier and more comfortable to blame aimpunch instead of ourselves, let's just do that. Fucking aimpunch!"
Dirtybomb,3cxqfv,SelfDefeatingChris,2,Sun Jul 12 01:53:40 2015 UTC,2) got a streak of lucky headshots   That's the problem right there. Luck shouldn't decide the outcome of a combat.
Dirtybomb,3cxqfv,SelfDefeatingChris,1 point,Sun Jul 12 02:06:06 2015 UTC,"Lucky as in ""this player isn't consistently capable of shooting this good, but this time he happened to do it"".  This happens in every single FPS game ever made. Hell, it happens in some form in every single game or sport where players play against each other. Human beings don't perform perfectly consistently. Sometimes they do especially bad, and sometimes they do especially well."
Dirtybomb,3cxqfv,dejecaal,8,Sun Jul 12 14:28:49 2015 UTC,"I was deep into Enemy Territory   I c wut u did thar, OP.  I'm not going to pretend to speak for everyone when I say this:  Aim Punch is painful. Right now SMGs are king, and I've noticed a lot less Fraggers/Skyhammers since the update. Coincidence? Quite possibly since I'm sure some of these guys are busy enjoying Phantom (let's not start the Phantom Circle Jerk in this thread please.) But truth be told, I'm only seeing three Phantoms tops in most of my games. I've also noticed an uptick in Proxy/Bushwacker play.  I almost exclusively play Sawbonez and I've noticed where before when I would engage a Fragger/Skyhammer/BR-16 Kira it was about a 50/50 depending on how well they could aim. Now? I can bum rush most of them with slight strafes thrown in and maybe a jump If I'm feeling froggy.   Aim Punch has wreaked havoc on weapon balance, and if you want to shred people grab Sparks with the EMP-9 and go to town.  Not to mention the other aspects, which you did a good job covering.   Yes positioning, Map awareness, and communication are very important parts of any competitive game, but those are ""meta"" skills. As you learn the maps, and play consistently with folks with headsets these things come together on their own. Aim Punch has nothing to do with them.    I am seeing a fallacy occur by the claimaints that kick punch favours the guy ""who aims bad but shoots first"".   People feel robbed, especially when they get killed by the level two who got lost in the map and ended up behind you, but I agree that's not the most likely scenario. Especially in pubs, people tend to hover around the same skill level and instead of getting a really fun/challenging 1v1 it's now tedious and kind of uncomfortable.   I used to crouch a lot more than I do now, but it seems like a lot of people are mostly aiming for meatshots now to more reliably stutter people.   Anyways, OP, those are my thoughts. Thank you for the write up, I enjoyed your view point.  [edit:] accidentally a word."
Dirtybomb,3cxqfv,dejecaal,2,Sat Jul 11 19:44:20 2015 UTC,"yeah thanks for the reasoned reply, I am far more willing to engage with people like you who post constructively and you bring some good points to the table. The SMG situation is extremely relevant, you will still tend to beat these players with a couple headshots. I am making these points because right now when I play both competitively and on random pubs, I feel like I am in a position of being, simply, far superior to a vast majority of players. I would expect this anyway with my FPS experience but really a HUGE amount of this comes from the fact that when I see my teammates through spec mode not only do I aim and track far better, but that they simply do not understand the game's weapon mechanics. For example, almost all Automatics are best shot in strafe mode by tapping the mouse button as fast as you can, rather than holding and bursting. I would say a good 80% of players still hold down fire for the entire duration of a clip, whether they are crouching or strafing. Honestly it's a bit annoying.  I find the super fast ROF SMGs are INCREDIBLY powerful at close range. The spread is so minimal that scoring 3-4 instant headshots successively is extremely common, resulting in a near instakill. Really these guns just need a higher base spread and a lower max spread to even out the equation.   I believe your point is extremely relevant because it highlights the weapon imbalances, however you must remember that weapons are supposed to imbalanced in a game like this with specific strengths and weaknesses.  People also need to remember that this is a team game. Aim Kick has a very strong effect when your team has a strong positional advantage and crossfires set up. No matter how good you are, if two guys are shooting you from different angles, the devs want you to die =)"
Dirtybomb,3cxqfv,Arg0ms,2,Sat Jul 11 22:20:19 2015 UTC,"almost all Automatics are best shot in strafe mode by tapping the mouse button as fast as you can   I totally learned something new from you! I'm not sure why I never thought of that before. Thanks, Man!   No matter how good you are, if two guys are shooting you from different angles, the devs want you to die =)   The only part of your reply I dislike, and that's not your fault. Sometimes I need to worm my way through the firefight until I can reach a downed team mate (I don't rez out of position bodies, I ain't that dumb) and If I'm already stuck in a 1v2 at least let me have the same chance at surviving as I did previously. Peeking and picking is something I'm fairly decent at, but with the changes It's pretty hard to accomplish. I feel like one of the better aspects of my personal gameplay has been negated by ""features"" and that's what bothers me the most."

Dirtybomb,3cxqfv,Imago90,1 point,Sun Jul 12 00:51:38 2015 UTC,"After a bit of getting used to the aimpunch, Fragger and Skyhammer feel completely playable again so long as you have Focus.  I feel the primary issue is that since heavier shots now kick you up faster, it's harder to compensate for the aimpunch by moving your crosshair back down. Then again I'm not sure if I ever properly did that with the old aimpunch either, if I did it was completely subconscious."
Dirtybomb,3cxqfv,dejecaal,8,Sun Jul 12 00:49:26 2015 UTC,"Do you all see the problem with your main criticism of aim-kick?     I still don't.        It works both ways.     Exactly. TTK is so long in this game that at any level where people can actually aim, you'll never kill someone just by getting the jump on them with a standard weapon (ie, not something meant to kill in one shot like sniper rifles). They always have the chance to turn around and shoot at you. So both people now have their aim randomly jerked around and since there's literally no way to compensate for it, precision is no longer rewarded."
Dirtybomb,3cxqfv,Arg0ms,5,Sat Jul 11 19:34:06 2015 UTC,"Exactly. It's not so much that who shoots first wins first. Sure, first shot has an advantage as it always will. The problem is that the game now feels random as the optimal strategy for both players is to body shot the shit out of eachother and hope that the combination of aim punch and spread favors you over your opponent because literally nobody can compensate for both aim punch and spread well enough to consistently headshot anymore."

Dirtybomb,3cxqfv,Busdriverx,1 point,Sat Jul 11 23:14:38 2015 UTC,"TTK is so long in this game   Define ""so long"". The majority of kills by competent people take a second, or sometimes two. Straight up duels between two people may take a bit longer, but not that much.  What makes the game feel slower are things like revives, heals, indirect fire and such. But that doesn't really have much to do with the time it takes to kill someone, does it?"
Dirtybomb,3cxqfv,Imago90,1 point,Sun Jul 12 01:07:47 2015 UTC,you'll never kill someone just by getting the jump on them with a standard weapon    aka you physically cannot kill someone before they can react in some way
Dirtybomb,3cxqfv,CaptainShaky,0,Sun Jul 12 13:06:15 2015 UTC,"you definitely can, most automatics in this game fire at very high ROFs and if you crouch and pinpoint your crosshair on their head from close-ish distance they will die in about a quarter of a second, i.e. they can't react anyway.  Do you really think that you can't kill people this quickly in this game?"
Dirtybomb,3cxqfv,CaptainShaky,-4,Sun Jul 12 17:43:39 2015 UTC,"TTK is not so long. TTK is incredibly quick. It's slow compared to 1 shot games like CoD. It's still incredibly quick if you aim well. Every single person who says ""very long ttk"" is just showing that they don't aim very well or understand the spray mechanics. sorry but if u say long ttk u may as well just say ""im bad""."

I'm guessing not because you don't seem to realise that Dirty bomb is literally the same game just ""modern"". The spray system is almost the same model just with higher rates of fire.

I care about how fun this game is, and to me, gunplay and 1v1 duels are made a lot less fun by a mechanic that randomly moves your crosshair when you take damage. I think the mechanic is outdated and the majority of players seem to agree, it subtracts from the games skillcap by making a game with an already low TTK even more based on who shoots first  and yes, positioning/strategy is a skill in itself but if you're shooting somebody from the side or from behind and still can't win the gun duel after shaking their screen with rng aimpunch then i think you need to practice your aim some more"
Dirtybomb,3cxqfv,MonkeyXing,-4,Sat Jul 11 22:30:26 2015 UTC,"that's the point, if they can't do it with all that stuff then receive a bunch of in return but a with more effect and lose the ""duel""; their opponent is superior and it is working as designed.  I feel like you sort of get what I am saying but just can't quite see the angle I am coming from."
Dirtybomb,3cxqfv,rukez,3,Sat Jul 11 22:33:46 2015 UTC,"I think that the positional advantage should reward the element of surprise and the first shot, not that it should dictate the fight entirely due to the random aimpunch element. If you shoot first against equally skilled players you'll most likely win in most games with low TTKs, but this game in particular makes it pretty much impossible to win in those situations because of the aimpunch. It lowers the skill ceiling and when you're attempting to design a fast paced potentially competitive FPS you should make a very clear decision: do we want to build this game around strategy or around gunplay, and at the moment it's a poor mix because of these design decisions"
Dirtybomb,3cxqfv,d1spatch,3,Sat Jul 11 22:52:25 2015 UTC,"How can you say that headshot damage should be upped when aim punch is as severe as it is now? Do you even play at least semi-competitively to have any experience versus decent players to backup any of your points? Even fights between high skill players have devolved into crouch spam fests where both players basically just try to body shot eachother because it becomes impossible to consistently headshot anyone when youre being aim punched by body shots + your opponent is mashing crouch + spread...   As to your point about positioning... If people wanted to play a game thats all about positioning and tactics, they would be playing CSGO. This game is not going to win over players who prefer tactical shooters... period... Virtually all players who would even consider playing this game long term and investing money into it prefer games like Wolfenstein ET or arena shooters. That is why people are upset. You can't just say ""Oh now the game takes tactical skill instead of aim skill, get over it."" A lot of people only play this game because it DOESNT put a lot of emphasis on positioning and tactical play, and by changing that fact, Splash Damage is essentially changing the market for the game a month into open beta."
Dirtybomb,3cxqfv,some_sherlock,1 point,Sat Jul 11 19:57:05 2015 UTC,"A lot of people only play this game because it DOESNT put a lot of emphasis on positioning and tactical play   I don't think that's true. An objective oriented game with different classes will always imply strategy and tactics. The game is supposed to balance individual skill AND good teamplay. Currently individual skill isn't rewarded at all. Which is very VERY frustrating, mostly when playing pubs."
Dirtybomb,3cxqfv,darkdagon605,3,Sat Jul 11 22:47:59 2015 UTC,"Even the player with the best situational awareness in the world can't look everywhere at once. If you can get attacked and immediately know where the attack is coming from, therefore reacting very quickly, you should be rewarded for that. Currently you're pretty sure to lose the fight if the attacker is a decent aimer. Some mercs are designed to push and be the spearhead of attacks. This implies potentially getting shot at by several people at once. It's not bad positioning, it's doing what you're expected to do with your merc. And you're getting punished for that by aimpunch, as you won't be able to aim correctly. The meta is now shooting the upper body and hoping for lucky headshots caused by aimpunch. Aiming for the head will just make you spray above your enemy. Even if aiming skills were not the center of the game, isn't it pushing it way too far ?"

In fact, no FPS game is   The skill required to win a fight is situational but sure, it isn't the ONLY skill needed. Still way to important to turn into RNG which is how the current system is.   if you get the jump on somebody, you will kill them almost instantly unless you are somebody who just goes for body shots (seriously guys start aiming at the heads)   With aimpunch present, bodyshots are safer. You can only go for headshots if they aren't paying attention to you. If they are, aiming for the head is way more risky as the slightest crosshair jump will result in a miss. The chest is a much larger target and it guarantees constant damage and aimpunch for the target.    Secondly, aimkick has excellent consequences for players in letting them punish poor players   Or show them that a large portion of aim is random thus reducing their chances of wanting to get better."

This. This so freaking much. Oh, the agony. I think I've rarely been killed by headshots in public servers. I always go for headshots because DB isn't the only FPS I play (CS:GO) and the golden rule of headshots = kills is hard-wired onto me. I feel delighted when I hear the headshot hit beep, but then, the enemy, who is, most of the time, a more powerful class like Fragger (I have Fragger but don't play him as much as others) just turns around and mows me down with bodyshots.  Headshots should be more rewarding.  About aimpunch, uh... Well... I don't think it's that big of an issue."

People talk about ""skill"" like they've all got aimbot installed, like if it weren't for that dastardly aimpunch, they'd all be getting 100% headshots with every bullet they fire.

Everyone is screaming that the sky is falling, but in reality we are in almost the exact same situation aim punch-wise that we have been since closed beta.

I'm sure you know what they are.  Here are phantom's pro/cons: Pros:   Katana M2 does shitload of damage and will 1 hit at least 4 of the classes at full health. Kek-10 as primary. That's the strongest gun in the game pretty much. Invsibility. Sure it's not 100% invisible like spy but it's good enough for ambushing. EXTRA FUCKING HEALTH FROM SHIELD. Shield regens in 6 seconds   Cons: - ???  Spy is balanced because he is weak as shit and useless if caught. Dead ringer works but forces the spy to relocate and hide for a bit. Spy is pretty much the perfect example of the glass-cannon niche and works beautifully in tf2. Obviously full comms and shit will negate spy quite a bit.  Phantom is a tank-cannon-spy. He has more health than almost all the characters with his shield up and a virtually instakill katana with a MASSIVE hit length which means you just beyblade your way around. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hhLy2LSc3qA  If that wasn't enough, Phantom has the best primary weapon.

Dirtybomb,3czj3b,Shabongbong130,2,Sun Jul 12 06:02:17 2015 UTC,"Personally, I feel like he needs more punishment if he gets caught. If I'm playing Proxy or Kira and see Phantom charging me, I have a very small window to react. I can either gun him down or run. Gunning is almost guaranteed to get me kebab-ed and if I turn to run he'll pull out his KEK-10 and mow me down. Even with stronger mercs, its harder to track phantom and he can still kill you quickly with a M1 swipe.  Im no expert, but this is how id balance him if I could, making him more of an assassin for primary targets rather than a walking blender.   Have his shield ""glitch"" out while he takes fire. This adds incentive not to charge people and plan your cloak more carefully while making him easier to track if he gets caught. Change it so he can only attack while uncloaked. Again, makes you have to actually sneak behind people, plan your attacks, and makes it harder to rush people head on. Change his primary to a machine pistol. He honestly doesn't need what is arguably the best gun in the game, and a melee with a long range and higher damage than other melees.    I think everything else is fine, but this game doesn't need a merc that can rush and kill most players instantly."
Dirtybomb,3czj3b,mr_banhammer,1 point,Sun Jul 12 06:03:07 2015 UTC,"Speed. Can attack in cloak unlike Spy which he has to uncloak first. Longer melee than spy's melees (I'm assuming). Top tier primaries. Heavy attack on anywhere unlike Spy has to backstab for max damage.   Personally, I love Phantom. I love camping on one spot then stabbing anyone that walks by.  Also, dead ringer is activated by getting damage while Phantom's cloak can be activated anytime and with the recent TF2 update, you get 20% damage resistance thingy but before you didn't."

Dirtybomb,3d093o,ninefingers79,3,Sun Jul 12 11:54:35 2015 UTC,"Games with Phantoms in them are not fun for either team, and I doubt they're even that much fun for the Phantom players themselves.     I find it unfun to play against Phantoms as well and most death to him feels super cheap but I doubt that the main Phantom players don't have fun with him because there are players who like to bully around and Phantom serve those players very well.     If Splash Damage can't find a way to balance Phantom then remove him.     Won't happen. He is here to stay but they need to tweak him a bit for sure. Maybe some minor tweaks like he has to uncloak before shooting/knifing, make him shiny for a second when he gets hit while cloaked and reduce the potential to kill multiple enemies with one 360° spin katana attack would help to make him less annoying and not nerf him to the ground.    From YBuS with love - Miller TR ftw! :D"
Dirtybomb,3d093o,Oottzz,1 point,Sun Jul 12 12:29:30 2015 UTC,"They honestly need to fix his heavy attack with the katana. It should really just be a stab that can only hit one person at a time. Other than that, they should just lower the armor amount on the cloak, but keep the duration. Maybe 50 or 45 armor at most.   Anyway, from what I've heard, Phantom got nerfed extremely hard back in the closed beta, which made him absolutely useless. The only thing worse than an OP Phantom is a useless merc that no one cares to play. We already have mercs in the game that are just straight up better than others in the same role. I believe that's the reason why SD are being cautious this time around when it comes to balancing Phantom."
Dirtybomb,3d093o,ControlPhreakk,1 point,Sun Jul 12 14:00:26 2015 UTC,"I bought phantom because it was lolop, but after one game i shit you not, i couldn't stand playing it. all you have to do as phantom is run up to someone (cloaked or not, it literally doesnt matter) and stab them.  I actually had to take a break for a couple hours today because there were 4 phantoms in the opposite team. i dunno like, its not fun to play, its not fun to play against. you need no skill at all."
Dirtybomb,3d093o,zorua,2,Sun Jul 12 19:03:53 2015 UTC,"While I am doing the same, and I appreciate your sentiment, long story short. You will get nothing but self-satisfaction out of this.  Your money doesn't matter. Those who saw Phantom is OP, immediately dropped $10 for it does. Those are DB's target consumer - you and me are just filler content to those who are willing to spend the money.  ""When the product is free, you are the product."""
Dirtybomb,3d093o,Hoshiyuu,2,Sun Jul 12 12:13:48 2015 UTC,Phantoms on the other team just made my entire team quit and I was the only one left. :(  This is just kind of ruining it for me.
Dirtybomb,3d093o,squidpei,2,Sun Jul 12 12:26:33 2015 UTC,Every phantom lobby is like that. The game is in Limbo
Dirtybomb,3d093o,Shade_Raven,0,Sun Jul 12 14:54:28 2015 UTC,I write on behalf of a gaming community of 100+ members   Most of whom haven't been seen online in 1-2 years.

Dirtybomb,3d093o,XohleT,-1,Sun Jul 12 12:58:54 2015 UTC,I like people demand something like the whole community is behind it when in fact only 165 players signed this petition .
Dirtybomb,3d093o,LLAMATARIANISM,3,Sun Jul 12 11:57:28 2015 UTC,"According to this survey, 1026 people disagree with the recent changes to aimpunch and 1043 people think Phantom is OP in his current state."
Dirtybomb,3d093o,XohleT,0,Sun Jul 12 12:44:12 2015 UTC,Still not the majority of the playerbase.   According to this there are about 10.000 players every day so there are approximately 9.000 players who don't agree with you or think the complete opposite.
Dirtybomb,3d093o,LLAMATARIANISM,2,Sun Jul 12 13:12:06 2015 UTC,"Or, much more likely, they didn't take the survey. Did you even click the link? About 1000 people is about 75% of people who took the survey."
Dirtybomb,3d093o,XohleT,0,Sun Jul 12 13:23:39 2015 UTC,Ye and 1300 out of 10000 people who don't take the survey doesn't met you can just extrapolate the result. For all we know the rest might as well not take the survey because it was long and they didn't want to waste the time taking it. So they don't really care and like the game as is. Because they haven't stopped playing and didn't think the problems are big enough to let their opinion know.
Dirtybomb,3d093o,LLAMATARIANISM,2,Sun Jul 12 13:26:47 2015 UTC,"Actually it's 1500 out of the 7600 people who are subscribed to this subreddit. Keep in mind that the subreddit was slightly smaller when this survey was on the front page, and that not all 7600 of those people were on reddit when it was on the front page.  Also, keep in mind that it is perfectly acceptable to extrapolate results and coming up with ""for all we know"" and ""what if"" scenarios doesn't change that."
Dirtybomb,3d093o,XohleT,0,Sun Jul 12 13:30:02 2015 UTC,You can only extrapolate results of a survey if the background of the players are known. And you don't need to be subscribed to this subreddit to visit this and take part in the survey.
Dirtybomb,3d093o,LLAMATARIANISM,2,Sun Jul 12 13:34:16 2015 UTC,The only place that the survey was posted was on reddit.
Dirtybomb,3d093o,XohleT,0,Sun Jul 12 14:02:04 2015 UTC,So if you want this problem addressed where would you go to let your opinion known. Reddit or DB Forums.

Dirtybomb,3czr6z,SelfDefeatingChris,5,Sun Jul 12 06:51:23 2015 UTC,Cone of fire bloom does not seem to recede quickly enough for tap firing to be a thing.
Dirtybomb,3czr6z,Nantei,1 point,Sun Jul 12 07:09:03 2015 UTC,"For those not in the know Tap firing can mean a lot of different things. Sometimes it's ""spam M1 as fast as possible"" sometimes it's a generic ""controlled, measure bursts"" and sometimes It's ""fire two shots stop .3 seconds, fire two shots.""   What?"
Dirtybomb,3czr6z,BeardyDuck,1 point,Sun Jul 12 10:49:48 2015 UTC,"tap firing should only be a thing with fragger, otherwise you can control your recoil by dragging."

Dirtybomb,3d0et2,Erfeo,3,Sun Jul 12 13:40:28 2015 UTC,Just play pub games for now and avoid competitive mode. You'll be fine.
Dirtybomb,3d0et2,CORUSC4TE,-4,Sun Jul 12 13:49:50 2015 UTC,apparently they got bored of competitive and now spoiling pub games too.
