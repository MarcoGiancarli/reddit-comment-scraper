When instead the full quote is inferring he doesn't want recruits who think ""Drugs are OK"".   Fact of the matter is, Possession is still illegal.  I wont sympathize with anyone who breaks the law; regardless of how frivolous that law is to them."
fresno,3dz7z1,Greyfeld,3,Mon Jul 20 19:47:42 2015 UTC,"Fact of the matter is, Possession is still illegal. I wont sympathize with anyone who breaks the law; regardless of how frivolous that law is to them.   Don't you think that view is a little black and white?  Just because something is illegal doesn't also make it immoral."
fresno,3dz7z1,Reilly149,-1,Mon Jul 20 20:36:01 2015 UTC,"Just because something is illegal doesn't also make it immoral.   Can you name something?   Everything I can think of that is typically illegal is pretty immoral in my personal opinion.  Ive lived my life thus far completely on one side of the law.  Ive got siblings & relatives who challenge the law constantly based on ""Grey area"" ideals.... and to be frank I don't consider them or their decisions as positive contributions to society.     edit;  I got to thinking...  Id like to add the caveat of;   I firmly believe that you can do whatever the hell you want under your own roof as long as it doesn't directly impact someone else who doesn't consent.  If you wanna shoot up Heroine while having a Donald Trump for President fund raising furry Orgy with a confederate flag Theme; more power to you.   But as my neighbor please don't bring that outside of your garage for my kid to see.   That to me is the only grey area.... do what you want with your life just don't let it impact mine and if it does, don't be surprised when there's enforced legal ramifications.  I dont wave my flag in your face,  dont wave yours in mine."
fresno,3dz7z1,Greyfeld,5,Mon Jul 20 21:53:32 2015 UTC,"Well, let's take this specific example.  Marijuana is legal in California.  It is not, however, legal federally.  So, does one law banning it make it immoral, or does the other law allowing it make it perfectly OK?  Let's say, for the sake of argument, that because federal law trumps state law, Marijuana is immoral.  If you were to go on a trip to Amsterdam, where it's completely and utterly legal to partake, would it suddenly become moral to do so?  Or does it remain immoral, because the country you hail from still cracks down on the drug?  At this point, we have shifting morals from states to countries to continents, and it appears that there is no strict moral code that adheres to one and all.  Which makes the idea of legality going hand-in-hand with morality utterly bonkers.  This doesn't even touch on things like Prohibition, voting rights, gay marriage, assisted suicide, abortion, and the hundreds of other ""gray area"" causes that have been illegal (or at least not legally recognized) at one point or another in our country's history."
fresno,3dz7z1,Reilly149,2,Mon Jul 20 22:46:38 2015 UTC,"My morals remain the same regardless.   A non-shifting example is cigarettes in general.  Personally I'm very against the use of Cigarettes in a public area.  Don't get me wrong I'm not that D-Bag that bitches at people for lighting up,  I'm just the quiet one that will get up and leave if you start smoking near me.  And because of that personal stance regardless of state, city, or federal law or ordinance,  I'll personally avoid any establishment that is encouraging Smokers.  In conjunction with that same train of thought, I personally pair up Tobacco & Marijuana, so a place like Amsterdam to me is not somewhere I see myself ever going to if its constantly touted as a Smokers dreamland.  Regardless of the immorality of all that, my point was if you are aware that a particular act is illegal in an area and you blatantly break that law regardless of how dumb the law is... I have trouble sympathizing.    A good example of that is I'm a fan of League of Legends,  League held their previous world championship all up and down Asia last year.  Foreign Visitors were instructed of regional laws & restrictions by a pamphlet included in your attendance ticket from Riot Games (the company that put the event on) multiple times; especially in areas as renowned for their rules as Singapore.  Had I attended, you could bet my sweet ass I would have obeyed the laws and not chewed any gum while jaywalking.  While I don't know of anyone that went, let alone got busted there... if I had a figurative friend who attended and knew of these rules but basically said ""F-U Singapore imma chew some bubbalicious"" then consequently got caned... I have no sympathy for them because they were aware of the consequences and deliberately chose to break the rules."
fresno,3dz7z1,Greyfeld,4,Mon Jul 20 23:05:29 2015 UTC,"Ah, okay, I get your stance now.  Yeah, if you do something you know is illegal, you only have yourself to blame when you get punished for breaking the law.  You can believe the law is stupid all you want (and I may even agree with you on the stupidity of said law), but when you're blatantly breaking that law, you're taking the risk of being punished for doing so."
fresno,3dz7z1,Reilly149,3,Mon Jul 20 23:36:38 2015 UTC,Yup 100%.  Now we're on the same page.

Or B as a political homophobic witch hunt which is probably likely since it was rightfully overturned (if that was the case)  I'm not well versed in how sodomy was enforced, and I'm pretty sure there were never any door to door sodomy checks.  Soooo I dunno really how to feel on this one."

fresno,3dz7z1,Reilly149,2,Mon Jul 20 23:39:28 2015 UTC,"My poli-sci classes way back when always slotted me in that totalitarian-esque grouping.  Maybe it was my upbringing as a kid, strict household and all that jazz.  My parents pounded through my head that every action has an equal and opposite reaction, that rules are not meant to be broken without relevant punishment.    I can see how that mental conditioning carries over.  I'm no fan of a Nanny state by any means but it's hard for me to not immediately respect authority and rules before even considering questioning them.    I'll check out that book though!  Thanks for the suggestion"
fresno,3dz7z1,Reilly149,0,Tue Jul 21 00:34:18 2015 UTC,"I disagree about context. The first part is Dyer's commentary on societal views; the second part (which I quoted) is about the state of the law. And I think the two are consistent. But while it wouldn't bother me so much if Dyer were looking for people with a particular outlook that goes against the grain of what he perceives as the majority view, it does bother me that he wants people who disagree with what the law is. That's why I just quoted the part about the law, and then only referred to law in the title.  Edit: Maybe we're just disagreeing on what ""decriminalize"" means. In this context, it seems clear to me that Dyer is talking about reducing things from felonies to misdemeanors, or from misdemeanors to infractions, and not about eliminating criminal liability all together."
fresno,3dz7z1,TheWeredude,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:26:44 2015 UTC,"to me the quote is more like saying;  ""I don't want recruits who will let people slide""  Thats the way it reads to me.  Which makes sense to me because I'd imagine if I had a foreman on a project and that foreman was constantly giving out freebies.... eventually thats going to come back and bite me in the ass.   Obviously i know Construction =/= Law enforcement,  but thats the closest relation I can think of in my world.  The ideal employee is one who takes his job serious and doesnt try to define it himself.    Which I believe is the point Dyer was making;  if Society says ""Weed isnt that bad""... and a Recruits job entails, unfortunately reprimanding people who are in Public Possession of Weed,  he doesnt want someone to write their own rules by saying ""Ya know I agree, weed isnt bad.. carry on buddy"".  Instead of just do their job as the law is written.  Thats the way I see it... lol Dyer wants hardasses.  edit* fixed some grammar"
fresno,3dz7z1,Kalimaro,2,Mon Jul 20 21:55:46 2015 UTC,"Zero tolerance and ""hardassery"" is the reason why the police force in the US has such a disgusting reputation now.  Especially with the changing views of how people view drugs in this country."
fresno,3dz7z1,herdown,0,Mon Jul 20 23:33:16 2015 UTC,"I can see that reading. To me the problem is that Proposition 47 essentially manifests the judgment of the people of California that marijuana isn't that important. And I think Dyer is pretty clearly saying that he disagrees, and wants officers in his department that also disagree.  You're right, of course, that possession of marijuana is still illegal. But for most people, particularly users, the State of California now considers it what you might call barely illegal. I know that's frustrating from the perspective of somebody who follows the rules, even the small ones, and expects others to do the same, or have consequences. I'm out there not jaywalking, using my turn signals appropriately, watering only on approved days, not possessing marijuana, and so on, so I definitely get that. But the fact is that law enforcement, and our entire justice system, has limited resources, so decisions have to be made where to focus their efforts. And it seems pretty clear to me that the people of California have said, ""Stop obsessing on weed!""  Matters are complicated significantly by differences between federal, state, and local laws, undoubtedly. But Dyer here specifically called out Proposition 47, which is a state law, and one that his department is charged with enforcing. And I think it's troubling to have a police chief that's out drumming up recruits and specifically looking for ones that disagree with that law.  And that especially bothers me in conjunction with the narrative in this particular article, about the fellow that failed the psych exam in 2007 for lack of maturity, decided that the best thing to do if he wasn't mature enough for law enforcement was join the Navy, and now finds himself back getting a job—with no word about his performance on a new psych exam. Maybe he's more mature now. I hope so. But somebody so persistent to get himself out there in a position of privileged violence, despite that particular setback, gives me pause.  Anyway, I understand your point, and I think it's reasonable. But I'm still bothered by Dyer's outlook."
fresno,3dz7z1,jeffrys_dad,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:46:19 2015 UTC,"Dyers outlook is open to interpretation, however, he states prop 47 as a whole. If you follow the process of someone who gets arrested and how their court case continues through the system, prop 47 has missed its intended target.   Whereas it may have reduced many crimes from felonies to misdemeanors, the offenders are indeed getting less in custody time and more treatment days.   However the issue is that there is no teeth to force them into treatment, a failure simply means that they face more time on probation.   Petty thefts and anything under grand theft including residential burglaries where homes are violated are seeing arrestees released only to serve no time in custody aside from their initial booking.   Tldr: prop 47 lessened the penalties for ""small time theft and drug use to a slap on the hand, doesn't force people to rehabilitate, or punish"""

You get two when you order the meal and you have to finish them before they will bring more and they then bring ONE rib out each time and won't even order the next one until you finish that one.

fresno,3dcihe,Reilly149,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:53:35 2015 UTC,"I love Robertitos,  still one of my favorites.  At least on my side of Fresno its really comparable in cost.  Arsenios and the like are right at the same burrito price point.     Sure its easy to say ""They're nearly double the old cost!""  but when you only charged $4.50 a burrito 10 years ago.... $1.50 but for the 10 year inflation isnt really asking that much.  Even the taco trucks up and down Jensen charge $5 a burrito,  they're twice the size of robertitos but they're 90% rice and beans.  Also size is relative; 10 years ago when I was scalping Kerman Robertito Burritos for $7 each at Central West (because sell 3 and I got mine free, perks of having the Drivers License) I could easily put down 2 full burrito's myself.  10 years later that same Chile Verde burrito Im stuffed before I finish it."

fresno,3dcihe,limitedwaranty,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:07:41 2015 UTC,"But having gone to Robertitos for the last 10 years+ myself.... I honestly dont feel a difference in size either.   I frequent the Kerman, Jensen & 99, and Blackstone & Gettysburg locations.  Our differences are probably in the Asada vs Chile Verde though.  Personally I cant stand their Asada,  its too salty to begin with.  The verde on the other hand has remained consistent in both size and taste since the first time I had Robertitos back in like '97"

Just a couple years ago the burritos were $5.50, a few years before that they were $4.50. I honestly think they expanded too fast and are trying to make up the cost, but instead they are getting less business."

fresno,3d7dha,worBD,2,Tue Jul 14 07:27:30 2015 UTC,"hey whats up, love the 805 area, alot of people here are from the 805, love the beer also,  but Fresno state student here and in a fraternity, i wasn't in a fraternity until my third year and let me tell you that you really don't need to be in a frat to party at fresno state, fresno is always poppin but it matters on who you know, the more people you meet the more parties you will know of, i thankfully lived with a football player and he always knew of the parties, and palazzo is always hoppin but palazzo parties get old after a while. the frats ussually wont let non greeks in, its a bummer but fresno is way to sketchy of a place to let randoms in all the time. if you want to meet people join a fraternity, there is no other eisier way or  better way, except you can join alot of clubs or if you live in the dorms, they have alot of great stuff going on in there to make friends, but i never lived there but thats just what i have heard.  but getting back to parties, i have been to some wild parties at the fraternities, i have been to parties in Sacramento and UC Davis and people say ""yo your from fresno state? i heard they rage their faces off there"" and its kinda true because thats the only thing to do in Fresno. but also if you want to get really detailed, north clovis and north fresno are the rich side and if there is ever a party over there it will be a rich kid party and they are insane. you have to go to one sometime. i hope this helped"

fresno,3d7dha,bigj7489,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:30:28 2015 UTC,"ya that will happen, basically because fresno state accepts people from around the area only, and like my whole home town goes to fresno state and the town next that goes to fresno state. every knows everyone in those towns so now it just moves to Fresno"
fresno,3d232v,farrflorence,9,Sun Jul 12 22:13:48 2015 UTC,"The only 'boutique hotel' I know of is the San Joaquin Hotel on Shaw Ave.  It looks like it has a cute garden/pool area, but I'm not sure how friendly it is to visitors.  There's plenty of great Armenian food scattered around town.  I'm partial to Hye Deli on Bullard and Marks since I work in the area.  I'd suggest calling ahead for take-out as it's not exactly gourmet.  Cafe Corazon makes the best cup of coffee in town.  Dusty Buns Bistro makes a delicious (and locally-sourced!) sandwich, if you're in the mood.   Give Doghouse Grill a go, but be aware that it fills up quickly for meal time and parking is abysmal, at best.  Woodward Park is a large and relaxing place to spend an afternoon/evening.  Check out the Japanese garden.  If you're willing to drive ~1 hr, the Cat Haven  is worth checking out.  Just a little further up the road and you're in Kings Canyon for plenty of views, hiking and/or picnicking.  If you're in town for the last week of December, look into Hmong New Year.  It's an interesting bit of culture you wont find anywhere else.  The other suggestions (zoo, underground gardens) are good, too."

fresno,3d232v,Reilly149,2,Mon Jul 13 09:03:00 2015 UTC,"Alot is almost an understatement.   It practically doubles the active size!  Was a really fun project to work on even though my company didnt get in.  Lets just say in all my time in construction, the African Exhibit was the first time I'd ever learned about ""Predatory"" and ""Large Animal"" Tolerances in concrete walls; everything from Scratch Proof, to Weight, to even Jump Heights.  I've got friends from Kansas that come over once a year and he loves our Zoo.  Says that its just as good as the St. Louis Zoo in his opinion.  While I've never been there,  I'll take his word... his family is really bonkers about zoos."

fresno,3d232v,bytesunfish,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:13:44 2015 UTC,"It wont be exactly ""Double"" but the space utilized will feel like way more than double.   Look at this Google Map I colored on  The Red area I circled is where the African Exhibit was drawn in to take place, at least when I saw the project back in late 2013.  The Blue area is what is currently there and Open to the public.  One really important thing to note though is that alot of this exhibit is wide open.  They're basically trying to create an Open savannah scenario for the Hoof Stock.  Which is awesome because it gives those animals waaaaaaaay more room and who knows what that'll open the Zoo up to use the old enclosures for.  That does translate to less side by side exhibits,  but I think we can all agree that they really made the smarter choice by giving the space to the animals rather than the people.  The website itself says that its an 18 acre expansion.   For visual sake... 1 football field is 1.3 acres;  you could fit almost 14 football fields checkerboarded in."

Chef Paul is apparently well-rooted in the downtown area, yet flies under most people's radar. The address might give some people pause, but the staff and the location itself are great, and the English language does not have adequate positive words to describe the food.   If there is one thing to avoid, though, I'd say it's the chicken and waffles. Any other meal you purchase will be incredibly filling at a very reasonable price ($10 for four pieces of fried chicken and two sides), but the chicken and waffles lacks sides, and comes with half the chicken. It almost seems like a grudging addition to their menu, and perhaps it is priced that way to encourage patrons to try other items.  TL;DR - As someone who has made many weekend trips to the bay for dining, I consider Chef Paul's Cafe to be a more rewarding/valuable experience than many S.F. stand-outs."

fresno,3ciyld,HEYBILLYMAYSHERE,1 point,Wed Jul 8 15:04:45 2015 UTC,"It returned this morning and I shot a video of it. This was a screen capture of it that was clearest: http://imgur.com/jeLmqjX  Definitely a Kit Fox! Do you know what the number of animal control is?  I submitted a form from the California Department of Fish and Wildlife on this page but IDK what the appropriate channel/phone# would be to contact about reporting an endangered species. I don't think it's safe for this fox to live around here since there's a lot of traffic and people around (we're also next to an elementary school), and raccoons/possums/rats live around here, which increases chances of people leaving out traps/poison."
fresno,3ciyld,SickBurnBro,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:00:00 2015 UTC,"I've read/heard anecdotally that one of the reason Kit foxes are endangered is they have little fear of humans. When I lived down in Taft they were very common and we'd see them in parking lots, backyards etc. Where I worked we even had a family of them in our yard and they never really bothered us. I think the big worry is what they carry. Ticks/fleas, possible diseases. One of my ex co-workers had a regular visitor to his house that his dogs got along with. It would eat dog food too."

fresno,3ce26y,MrHarryReems,2,Tue Jul 7 15:25:15 2015 UTC,"Townsmen Barber on Shaw and Fruit.  Killer cut, and he uses a straight razor on the sideburns.  Make an appointment."
fresno,3ce26y,3seven1,2,Tue Jul 7 19:49:28 2015 UTC,Shaw and Maroa. That's my barber too. Call Bill and make an appointment!

fresno,3ccuut,worBD,6,Mon Jul 6 22:38:08 2015 UTC,Neighborhood Thrift in tower district is great.   I got a huge desk there for my office a couple of years ago for like 15 bucks and another 10 bucks for delivery.   Their stock is constantly changing and they are pretty reasonable. You should swing by and check them out.
fresno,3ccuut,lookitsdan,2,Tue Jul 7 01:46:55 2015 UTC,"Agree. For a thrift store, it's got surprisingly nice stuff. And all the antique/vintage furniture stores about a block away down Olive (west of Palm) are very reasonably priced too."
fresno,3ccuut,fresbro,5,Tue Jul 7 03:13:33 2015 UTC,Check out the cherry auction swapmeet. It's open Tuesday and Saturday 630am to 330pm
fresno,3ccuut,bacon_taste,2,Tue Jul 7 00:27:30 2015 UTC,"Your best bet as far as I know are the actual Salvation Army's.  They usually have furniture but it's not the cheapest.  Other than that, I would try yard sailing.  Check craigslist for sales friday nights/saturday mornings and plan a route.  There used to be a furniture gold-mine called ""The As-Is Warehouse"" but I think it folded years ago."
fresno,3ccuut,BurtBacarat,2,Tue Jul 7 01:16:59 2015 UTC,Operation cleanup is happening around maple and teague. People are actually throwing out sone pretty impressive furniture out on the street. You ahould really check it out. Might find a gem there. Saw maybe four sets of furniture while driving by on my way to my house.

Yeah, scavengers took it, but that’s what we wanted.  It was in good condition, why waste it?"
fresno,3ccuut,Callmedory,-19,Wed Jul 8 20:03:13 2015 UTC,"Yes, there are a couple thrift/goodwill stores that carry furniture. there is this awesome website called google try it out!"
fresno,3ccuut,stlnthngs,11,Mon Jul 6 23:29:50 2015 UTC,"Asking for a recommendation on where to buy furniture is not unreasonable, dick. How are they supposed to know if the places in Google are any good?"
fresno,3ccuut,IsThatSickInFinnish,-8,Tue Jul 7 00:13:07 2015 UTC,"He's looking for cheap patio furniture. Not a fucking car. You make a phone call, read some reviews if your that picky."
fresno,3ccuut,stlnthngs,2,Tue Jul 7 05:01:09 2015 UTC,The furniture industry is just as shady as the auto industry.
