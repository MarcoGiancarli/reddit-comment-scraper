Slipknot,3e40rc,slipknotblog,10,Tue Jul 21 20:00:59 2015 UTC,"I'm a mad Sid Wilson fan, here are some of my sugestions. I hope I can help you a bit or at least give you a bit of insperation.   Being the guy that put the icing on the cake, how hard is it for you to deliver/come up with something  in time to add to all the songs? any change you and Rob Gee will collaberate again in the future (for maybe a full album)? How weird can it be from time to time for you being on the road with all metalheads (for most of the time) and you comming from an hole other scene? Vestax or Technics? How did you come up with the idea to hook up a whammy pedal to your TT? TATTOO: why did you change you're 'MUST KILL' tat to 'MOST ILL', what was the inspiration behind it, and are you able (if it's not to personal) to tell a bit about the person/mate who s started writing 'must kill' on to you're fingers, (that guy comitted suicide, so maybe a bit to personal to ask) LIVE: How does it feel when you are passing by the crowd at a live show and you see a person dressed like you (gasmask on ect)?   Fun ones:   what did you do with Sid the first and Sid the second? did any of the other Slipknot members ever had a go with your turntables and  if they did where they any good?"
Slipknot,3e40rc,JRT_999,8,Tue Jul 21 20:15:13 2015 UTC,I really like the last one about if anyone else has tried the turn tables
Slipknot,3e40rc,bigbear2129,5,Tue Jul 21 21:13:40 2015 UTC,I also like that question
Slipknot,3e40rc,BGRTS,3,Tue Jul 21 21:35:33 2015 UTC,i like that question as well
Slipknot,3e40rc,RichardSaunders,3,Wed Jul 22 00:28:21 2015 UTC,Now I'm picturing Mick on the turntables
Slipknot,3e40rc,HeliHijack20,3,Wed Jul 22 03:32:15 2015 UTC,I like the scene question
Slipknot,3e40rc,BillyTalentfan,3,Tue Jul 21 23:38:15 2015 UTC,I like those questions. They are not the standard questions that are asked to Corey (or can be asked to any band member).
Slipknot,3e40rc,BGRTS,6,Tue Jul 21 21:54:40 2015 UTC,"Here's a few that I'd throw at him, having a chance:   How satisfied is he with the album and tour cycle so far? Is there anything he would like to add, change or point out that he thinks is great about it? How did he like working with Jay and Alex, did he have a lot of interaction with them?  How much different was the writing process with this album, you clearly had a much more vocal experience with .5 The Grey Chapter, would you like to replicate the experience or change it in any way? Where does he stand with the double concept album ideas floating about, is there anything he would like to experiment with or do with the new album(s) specifically, that he didn't get to do before? (Or maybe something as the sort of scratching solos we saw earlier on around the Iowa era?) What are other side projects he's working on now and when are they coming out? He had surgery a little while back, which definitely affected his on-stage performance with Slipknot, we've seen him getting crazy again... How's the health? He's definitely taking better care of himself with the road and years passing by, anything of his routine he wants to just vent or rant off about?"
Slipknot,3e40rc,NoXander007,3,Tue Jul 21 20:14:37 2015 UTC,"Awesome questions, thank you!"
Slipknot,3e40rc,NoXander007,2,Tue Jul 21 20:21:04 2015 UTC,My pleasure.
Slipknot,3e40rc,NegativeDevil,3,Tue Jul 21 20:24:04 2015 UTC,"Ask him if he'll ever write a full song (or like a basis for a full song, you know), or ever contribute vocals in Slipknot. Based on his solo stuff, he can really sing and write songs and it would be cool to hear in a softer Slipknot song."
Slipknot,3e40rc,JRT_999,2,Tue Jul 21 22:42:54 2015 UTC,"vocals in 515 is him when he found out his grandfather died, he also did backing vocals to people=shit (same day his gandfather died)."
Slipknot,3e40rc,NegativeDevil,3,Tue Jul 21 23:28:56 2015 UTC,"I knew about (515), didn't know about People = Shit though. Cool fact. I meant more like greater contributions on full songs."

Slipknot,3e40rc,thewickerman5123,6,Wed Jul 22 00:27:25 2015 UTC,For 515? Sid locked himself in the studio with the lights off and the mic on. Then he screamed everything out of his system
Slipknot,3e40rc,Skullkan6,3,Wed Jul 22 01:19:00 2015 UTC,Ask him how much work he does with Craig on album's or how their relationship is in studio. EDIT: Reposted with what I originally had in mind.

Slipknot,3e0h6g,ruinawish,12,Tue Jul 21 00:32:36 2015 UTC,"Donnie Steele was one of Slipknot's first guitarists, from 1995 to 1996. He recorded on Slipknot's first album, Mate. Feed. Kill. Repeat, and only played one show with the band, before reportedly leaving due to conflicting spiritual interests. Donnie himself said in a 2010 interview:    ""I had a lot on my mind spiritually and other areas of my life that needed attention.""   He was replaced by Craig Jones (yes, that Craig Jones, who when later replaced by Mick on guitar duties, subsequently moved to his sampling position). There doesn't appear to be any footage or photographs of Donnie while he was in the band during this era.  Prior to Slipknot, Donnie Steele was involved in a death metal band called Body Pit, also featuring Paul Gray and original Slipknot vocalist Anders Colsefni. You can see some rare footage of Body Pit rehearsing here. Bonus trivia: original Slipknot guitarist Josh Brainard can be seen at the start of the rehearsal checking out the band.  Donnie re-emerged following the death of Paul Gray in 2010, when he was asked by the band to play live bass for their 2011 tour. Donnie himself even went to Paul's mother to ask for her blessing! In a controversial move, Donnie played the bass backstage, out of sight of the crowd. Clown explained:    ""What gives him the right to be onstage with us right now? When we’re going through an experience like this with our fans, they need to concentrate on the eight members that are grieving, not on someone new. This isn’t a diss on Donnie. I love Donnie, but we chose to tour for just one reason — to share the tragedy, pain and grief of what happened to Paul with our fans instead of going through it alone.”   At Sonisphere UK 2011, the band actually got Donnie out from backstage to partake in their Paul Gray tribute, while ""Til We Die"" ran over the PA. You can see footage of this here.  Following this, Donnie was involved in the band's studio work for .5: The Gray Chapter, but did not last long, with Jim stating: ""We brought him in to help us out in the studio for a while. But it wasn’t really jivin’. He wanted to go home and get married and do all that stuff. It’s just better off for us to kinda move on from Donnie.”  And thus ended Donnie's second association with Slipknot. Besides Slipknot, the only other band of note that Donnie worked in was Killpact, a death/thrash metal Des Moines band, assembled in 2001--now presumably defunct.  Another piece of trivia: in an interview with ultimate-guitar, Jim hinted that Donnie had been working with Paul prior to his death, on a ""death metal or speed metal or maybe even a thrash record""."

My uncle still keeps in touch with him every once in awhile.  Apparently when he started touring after Paul's death, they gave him a list of basses he needed to get. When he showed up with them, they asked him where all the backups were. They wanted him to have double the amount of basses. So they had them all flown in. Pretty crazy."

Slipknot,3dsxei,cocoram,15,Sun Jul 19 05:35:24 2015 UTC,"This is the reason I can't stand that Joey was fired and wasn't able to contribute to an album that was dedicated to Paul. But no one knows the details leading up to Joey's departure, it just makes me sad that he wasn't able to be involved. Hopefully Joey get his life straightened out, but that's just me making assumptions on why he was fired."
Slipknot,3dsxei,Boobies_Are_OK,12,Sun Jul 19 06:01:38 2015 UTC,I honestly never thought of that. That's really sad.
Slipknot,3dsxei,HeliHijack20,5,Sun Jul 19 06:02:41 2015 UTC,same thing occurred to me when i watched an old video of him giving a tour of his house and just about every room was full of either awards or memorabilia from slipknot. the band was his life.
Slipknot,3dsxei,RichardSaunders,4,Sun Jul 19 11:12:31 2015 UTC,"If they wouldn't have fired Joey, there wouldn't have been a .5 TGC.... that's what people need to realize. Not to mention, Joey's inability to control his demons. Whatever the case and whatever was going on, it was bad enough for the other members to move on without him. Sad to see Joey go but they made the right decision and the fans get to reap the benefits of having such a great cd to listen to."
Slipknot,3dsxei,mnmetaldude,-10,Sun Jul 19 20:01:12 2015 UTC,Because Slipknot stopped being about family.  It's just another business.

Slipknot,3dn487,RichardSaunders,4,Fri Jul 17 16:51:14 2015 UTC,Corey said that they wrote Circle during Iowa.
Slipknot,3dn487,trevors685,2,Fri Jul 17 18:18:14 2015 UTC,I could see circle being a more hardcore sont
Slipknot,3dn487,BillyTalentfan,3,Sun Jul 19 00:41:25 2015 UTC,"It's nice to put things into perspective. Consider the band that you see in the Disasterpieces DVD. If that's what you're used to regarding slipknot, it's a real clash to see what they were doing in Vol.3, so attributing that sound to a proximity to stone sour wouldn't be too far fetched.   I guess the main thing here is that what we consider to be slipknot was not fully formed until Vol. 3. That album was a choice moment, it's almost their ""real"" sophomore album considering that s/t and Iowa were released so close to each other and both include the largest amount of MFKR-era material compared to other albums. Though the albums are different, they do share sort of the same angst-ridden manic approach to music, and you couldn't really see them going to a more elaborate direction like they did later on.  So I get what you say, and by this logic I think it makes little sense to say that, say, Devil in I sounds like Stone Sour. It's already embedded with that more ""complex"" slipknot feel that we know is their's and not stone sour's, since ever since their second album stone sour has ALSO changed into something else in itself, like you said.  Thanks for this post!"
Slipknot,3dn487,porcacultor,0,Sat Jul 18 10:29:52 2015 UTC,"for a while the disasterpieces dvd was slipknot for me. when vol 3 and all hope is gone came out i liked the albums, but only kinda. i thought they were a bit awkward sounding, vol 3 especially. now that gray chapter came out i almost like it better than iowa, and i know they couldnt have done it without having experimented like that on vol 3. so in the end im definitely glad they went through that phase."
Slipknot,3dn487,NegativeDevil,2,Sat Jul 18 12:34:45 2015 UTC,"Even Vol. 3 didn't sound like Stone Sour. Maybe the musically uninitiated would make the comparison, but anyone who listens to more than the vocalist would never compare the bands to each other at any point. From what I understand, you're not comparing though, just trying to explain the reasoning of people who do. But those people are still just plain wrong, and don't really know what they're talking about."
Slipknot,3dn487,NegativeDevil,0,Fri Jul 17 17:01:25 2015 UTC,"but that is what im saying. in 2004, vol 3 sounded like stone sour. maybe not in every way, but there were a lot of things about that album that sounded more like stone sour than slipknot at the time. the only counterarguments ive ever heard have been ""you dont know music well enough"" or ""corey says they sound different"" which doesnt cut it for me."
Slipknot,3dn487,NegativeDevil,0,Fri Jul 17 18:01:20 2015 UTC,"So you're saying Vol. 3 sounds like Stone Sour because:  1) It has guitar solos  2) It has soft songs  By that logic, Aerosmith sounds just like Dream Theater. It just doesn't work that way. There's so much more to the music. Slipknot solos don't even sound like Stone Sour ones (Jim Root may have been in both bands but you can tell there's a difference in how he plays, plus Mick and Josh are worlds apart), Slipknot soft songs don't sound like Stone Sour soft songs, Slipknot clean vocal melodies don't sound like Stone Sour clean vocal melodies, and so on.  The counterargument ""you don't know music well enough"" actually makes quite a bit of sense in response to the people who compare the two bands, and is a sufficient response in itself."
Slipknot,3dn487,NegativeDevil,0,Fri Jul 17 18:59:20 2015 UTC,yeah. maybe im crazy but i think theres a bit more similarity there than between dream theater and aerosmith.
Slipknot,3dn487,NegativeDevil,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:28:52 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Corey and Jim. They're the only real similarity. Even then, Corey's singing style and Jim's playing style are very different between the two bands."

Slipknot,3dkdfh,EnterTheTragedy,3,Fri Jul 17 16:57:13 2015 UTC,"Especially since mr.""shitbag"" joined Slipknot"
Slipknot,3dkdfh,Inzektor-Magileine,2,Fri Jul 17 17:06:48 2015 UTC,Good read.
Slipknot,3dkdfh,ruinawish,2,Fri Jul 17 04:21:02 2015 UTC,Jay and V-man...getting shit done. Very cool story. Glad to hear Corey compliment and discuss how they came into the fold.
Slipknot,3dkdfh,WLLMWM-phil,1 point,Fri Jul 17 06:47:51 2015 UTC,Corey mentioned three songs they've never played live before but the setlists arent ipdated. Anyone know what songs?
Slipknot,3dkdfh,squidgeymon,2,Fri Jul 17 06:22:07 2015 UTC,I believe one of them was Killpop
Slipknot,3dkdfh,redman1401,2,Fri Jul 17 06:31:57 2015 UTC,"If it was the night they played Killpop, they also played Gently for the first time with this lineup, but there wasn't any other debut listed."
Slipknot,3dkdfh,redman1401,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:47:15 2015 UTC,well considering it was from about a week or so ago it's not the ones he mentioned during the AMA.
Slipknot,3dkdfh,redman1401,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:18:15 2015 UTC,"That being said, he also didn't say Slipknot never played it live, he may of meant them with the new guys which could be many shows, one I see they played people = shit live which is the first time with the new guys I believe, along with killpop being a recent addition."
Slipknot,3dkdfh,redman1401,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:24:02 2015 UTC,"People = Shit was the first song they played with the new lineup, the first day of Knotfest. So not that one. Either he made a mistake in saying that they played three new songs in one night, or setlist.fm is wrong, because I've been keeping up with Slipknot's new setlists on the site and not once this tour have they played three new songs in one night as far as I've seen."
Slipknot,3dkdfh,redman1401,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:42:06 2015 UTC,"setlist.fm i doubt is right 100% of the time, but it all depends on when the interview was done as well. it was put up a week ago, but it may have been awhile back, he did say it had been around 7 weeks since they had played which is nearly 2 months."
Slipknot,3dkdfh,redman1401,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:04:57 2015 UTC,"Looking at the setlists, the one time that it would of been 7 weeks would of been in april, which they premiered AOV, played Get this, so there may be something else missing there."
Slipknot,3dkdfh,redman1401,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:10:11 2015 UTC,"Just checked, it's killpop, Gently and AOV, with AOV having premiered a few nights before."
Slipknot,3dkdfh,redman1401,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:14:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah but then AOV doesn't count anyway, because he said three songs they hadn't played live until that point."
Slipknot,3dkdfh,HeliHijack20,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:17:48 2015 UTC,"No he said 3 songs we only recently started playing live. It's those 3, looking at the time frame he gave of them not having played in 7 weeks, that falls there since that's the only time that there's that much time off on the tours since the new guys joined."
Slipknot,3dkmf1,NegativeDevil,5,Fri Jul 17 01:03:37 2015 UTC,Ha! That fucker jumped when he realized the song wasn't finished!

She's improvising quite a bit too rather than playing it the way it was written..which is no big deal she still has talent and it sounds all right!

Slipknot,3dc2ij,Moonjami,2,Wed Jul 15 04:43:12 2015 UTC,Go with Corey...  His recent video message to Kanye exemplifies #3... All be it in a rather vulgar fashion.  Mourning is also easy as .5 is all about mourning.  Any member of Slipknot is persecuted for the sake of righteousness... Though probably not in the way intended by the Beatitudes ;) actually you could make a case that throwing Joey out of the band and being persecute for it qualifies. Because if what many believe is true and Joey was battling the same type of addiction issues that led to Paul's death... The sort of tough love is the righteous thing. And lord knows they were persecuted for it.  Corey has absolutely admit he is poor in spirit... His book 7 deadly sins is all about it... As are many of his song lyrics.  --I'll add to this as I read more--

On the second repetition of the last chorus, either Jim or Mick (or both, can't really tell) started playing the riff that's supposed to come after the chorus.

Slipknot,3d640u,Man_Of_Metal,5,Mon Jul 13 23:01:08 2015 UTC,"I DON'T want Ross Robinson, its been over a decade since then and going back is kind of going back to a ""Been there done that"" kind of thing, Korn tried to do the same thing with Korn III and it doesn't inspire confidence. Trying to recapture an old sound rarely ever works in anyone's favor so I'd prefer they just move ahead and try new things with a different producer. I don't even think Ross would fit with Slipknot's new direction."

Slipknot,3d640u,GrumpingIt,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:36:54 2015 UTC,"I think Ross isn't ""there"" anymore for the band. As SyfeMusic said, Korn tried something similar and it just didn't work. When it was rumored that he was working with the band on .5, he himself dismissed it on twitter (can't find source but it's true) saying something to the effect that he loved the guys but wouldn't work with them anymore because both parties moved on. The future is unwritten, but I don't think he's in the cards, even though I feel he's the last producer ever to understand slipknot fully (but as a counterpart to that, the band isn't remotely the same it was in the early 00s)."

Slipknot,3d6646,alchemistjuice_,2,Tue Jul 14 02:54:56 2015 UTC,"Corey mostly sings in his mid range in Slipknot. It's in Stone Sour where he really gets up there, especially in the early demos as another user pointed out. Listen to Monolith, Zzyxx Road, Say You'll Haunt Me. If you pluck his notes out on a keyboard, you'll find that he regularly hits Gs and As in the big parts of those songs. In slipknot he tends to stay in the C-E/F range, with the exception of Sulfur where he goes up to a G.  Also the last note in Bother is an Ab. And the poster above me is right. He sings in the G/A range in several parts of Dying."

Slipknot,3d1a2e,Todrick,1 point,Sun Jul 12 18:28:31 2015 UTC,"Well I mean, MFKR is an album whether you consider it to be one or not. It was recorded professionally (i.e., not demos) and was meant to be their debut. Saying it's not an actual Slipknot album to you would be different entirely, as it's not considered a part of Slipknot's professional discography. It's just the Slipknot of a different time period of course, and they didn't want to consider it their debut anymore. It's still an important part of their history and an album in itself."
Slipknot,3d1a2e,Todrick,0,Mon Jul 13 02:43:38 2015 UTC,THEY don't consider it part of their discography... And reused parts of it for their actual debut.  It's not an album.
Slipknot,3d1a2e,Todrick,0,Mon Jul 13 02:54:14 2015 UTC,"...But it is. Whether it's a Slipknot album, and thus a part of their discography, is, of course, up to them to say. It's still an album in itself. That really can't be debated. It's not a demo, because it was professionally recorded, produced, and released as an album."
Slipknot,3d1a2e,Todrick,0,Mon Jul 13 03:18:31 2015 UTC,"1,000 is not an album.  Self distribution is also not indicative of an actual album.  It may be an album because of length, and because it technically had a record label.  But, it was such a small run with no distribution that it was, by comparison, a demo."
Slipknot,3d1a2e,Made_of_Scarsss,3,Mon Jul 13 03:35:54 2015 UTC,"The amount of distribution doesn't define whether it's an album or not.  That's like saying a book isn't a book because it hasn't been published and sold. If it's completed, it's a book, whether it was distributed or not."
Slipknot,3d1a2e,Todrick,0,Mon Jul 13 03:53:29 2015 UTC,"So you'd consider Scars on Broadway's 2nd album part of their discography?  It's been done since 2013... It's just never been released.  That doesn't want count to me.  I get what you're saying MKFR is ""technically"" an album... But I'll never consider it part of Slipknot's discography or include it in a list of their albums."

Slipknot,3d1a2e,Todrick,0,Mon Jul 13 17:54:28 2015 UTC,"I wish I knew... their website has had a sample of one song, ""Guns are loaded"" on it since mid 2012... they've played 3 or 4 songs live in their entirety.  But Daron was clear that the album was done in Jan 2013. even saying that it ""was probably one of the easiest and most fun experiences I’ve ever had making a record"" and that it ""was done in under two weeks.”  Then System of a Down got back together and Scars just got sidelined I guess.  Kills me, cause while, it's great that SOAD is touring... if they're not going to release a new album... at least Daron could release the Scars album."
Slipknot,3d1a2e,SirEbabalot,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:07:00 2015 UTC,that's what i was figuring. Man it'd be great for new SOAD material. Thanks for all the information brother.
Slipknot,3d1a2e,Freddiegristwood,0,Mon Jul 13 19:57:12 2015 UTC,"I didn't know about Scars on Broadway's 2nd album because I haven't explored their material yet, but based on what you've said about it, yes, that absolutely can be applied to the definition of an album. On a side note, I have to say, that's peculiar that it hasn't been released in the two years it's been done.  And yeah that's exactly what I'm saying. It doesn't have to be considered a part of their official discography, but it's an album, and they made it."

Slipknot,3d1a2e,Tbhjr,1 point,Mon Jul 13 05:24:51 2015 UTC,"I think that's actually a very good way of describing it. It's not at all representative of the band in their professional years, 1999 to present, but it definitely has the ideas leading up to the band we know and love. I think it's an important part of the band's history though. I do consider it a Slipknot album, just not the Slipknot that we know as Slipknot, if that makes sense."

Slipknot,3d1y8n,NegativeDevil,4,Mon Jul 13 08:31:39 2015 UTC,".5. It feels to me like their most cohesive, focused effort to date, and I feel like their songwriting ability and musicianship are at their peak, or at least, they're more consistently good in those aspects. Iowa and Slipknot follow very closely though, in that order. Vol. 3 has the best experimental music of their career but the heavier songs fall short imo. All Hope Is Gone has almost entirely really great (mostly underrated) songs, but as a whole it feels unfocused and lacking."
