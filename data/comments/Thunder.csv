I don't care what you think of Barnes, this is an incredibly stupid thing. I'm glad it won't happen.   But really, Barnes was a shithead on the court because he knew it would get under people's skin and give him an advantage. He was never a star but he was a 100 effort guy who played his role perfectly."

Kind of stuck up.  I think he wants to be on a team centered around him.  Just like how Reggie wanted to be a starter.  He wanted it more than a championship.  I personally think he wanted to be in Portland, he wanted OKC to not pay out.  He wanted to be the main attraction more than being a champion.  Just remember this comment and we'll see if my hunch was right."

Thunder,3dwdb2,soonerzen14,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:57:35 2015 UTC,If anything is a good sign if you had them last year. Last year was a nightmare
Thunder,3dx3au,DaBear405,4,Mon Jul 20 06:41:24 2015 UTC,"As far as I'm concerned, last year was a gap year. That being said, our last ""full"" year we made the WCF and took the eventual champion Spurs to 6 games without Ibaka for the first two. Our bench that year consisted of D-Fish, Reggie Jackson, Caron Butler, Nick Collison and Steven Adams. Our bench now is Augustin/Payne, Morrow/Roberson/Waiters (whichever two don't start), Singler/Huestis, McGary/Collison, and Steven Adams (assuming Kanter starts), not to mention replacing the often-criticized Kendrick Perkins with an offensive prowess in Enes Kanter (again, see last assumption). Needless to say, I think we've improved beyond what any of us might have dreamed. We have the pieces to do it, now all we need is the luck."
Thunder,3dx3au,OKCbmoreandMD,7,Mon Jul 20 16:58:36 2015 UTC,We have the guys to win it. We have had a random injury each of the last 3 season that's knocked us out of the race.   Ideal senario would be to give the big 3 around 30 minutes per game and to rest KD on back to backs. High seeding dosent mean shit if your guys are run ragged.
Thunder,3dx3au,Greas3dLightning,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:46:49 2015 UTC,"We should do what the Warriors did. During blowouts, we'll sit our stars and let our B squad do the heavy lifting in the 4th quarter."
Thunder,3dx3au,TheCoxer,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:59:05 2015 UTC,I think that had something to do with getting KD the MVP and scoring title in the past. Now it's time for a championship.
Thunder,3dx3au,KurteL10,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:24:17 2015 UTC,I think the title for the post is really misleading. It seems to indicate that the problems of last year stemmed from poor play.   The only real thing we need to do to improve is get/stay healthy. That's it. We had a Finals caliber team two years ago.

Thunder,3dx3au,cbnb,-8,Tue Jul 21 18:45:39 2015 UTC,"'but assuming everyone stays healthy, OKC has the talent and depth to compete with any team in the league.' - I wouldn't be so eager to assume that. Every year one of the main players get injured in the most crucial moment. As far as I know Durant is not even sure to be ready for the season opening..."
Thunder,3dx3au,Marko_Milicic,8,Mon Jul 20 10:45:15 2015 UTC,All the depth should help reducing the minutes on KD RW and Serge. Doesnt mean they wont get hurt but it helps.
Thunder,3dx3au,AFCgunner95,0,Mon Jul 20 13:32:25 2015 UTC,"True, but that's even more complicated. Durant's latest injury had nothing to do with fatigue whereas Russ went crazy when he averaged 45 minutes per game and played every single night :)"

Thunder,3dx3au,AIMpb,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:24:25 2015 UTC,KD should be filly clear by training camp maybe sooner. He even played in a celebrity softball game today.
Thunder,3dw9s4,gamesshades,5,Mon Jul 20 01:41:00 2015 UTC,"I still think they are behind GS, SA, and us, but I think this improves them and damn man, this just further solidifies that 4 of the top 5 teams will be in the West this year. You could honestly argue 6 of the top 7. I very much respect Lebron and the Cavs, but oh, to have their road to the finals.."
Thunder,3dw9s4,tjc815,0,Mon Jul 20 05:39:20 2015 UTC,"I think the Clippers with Pierce/Lance/Josh Smith signings are better than Houston as well. They still have that CP3/Blake/DJ trio too. As a blatant homer, I go:   OKC SA GSW LAC HOU/MEM"
Thunder,3dw9s4,SoonerAristotle,2,Mon Jul 20 14:45:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah I honestly feel like LAC is better than Houston, too, which is why I was so confused when they lost to them in the conference semis. Maybe their offseason acquisitions will actually push them ahead, I was just giving Houston the benefit of the doubt after last year."
Thunder,3dw9s4,tjc815,3,Mon Jul 20 20:18:41 2015 UTC,"In all likelihood the West just got a little more competitive. Lawson is an upgrade over Prigioni. With DMo back and Beverly healthy Houston looks even better than the team that made it to the WCF. The did lose Josh Smith (who was pretty big at times for them), but their front court still has a decent amount of depth.   That said, Rondo was supposed to vault the Mavs into contention last year. Not every signing works as well in reality as it does in theory."
Thunder,3dw9s4,Yougrok,10,Mon Jul 20 06:20:36 2015 UTC,uhh they were in the WCF last year.  I think adding Ty Lawson is huge. His 3 point shot is nasty and they won't miss much of a beat if they stagger Ty / Harden's minutes.
Thunder,3dw9s4,firescottbrooks,7,Mon Jul 20 01:44:03 2015 UTC,"Dont know about nasty, he shot between 34-36% the last couple of seasons. Decent but not great. Beverly shot about the same as him."
Thunder,3dw9s4,Greas3dLightning,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:58:46 2015 UTC,It just feels like another guard that Russell will attack as soon as he can. I also think DJ can play well on him. Maybe trouble for another team but not much for us.
Thunder,3dw9s4,DeadNny,-6,Mon Jul 20 04:02:59 2015 UTC,"Dwight will abuse Kanter. Harden will abuse Waiters and Morrow. What's your point?   Not every position is going to have a lock down defender.   Also, stop with the ""I think this will happen"" or give a valid argument as to why."
Thunder,3dw9s4,Greas3dLightning,12,Mon Jul 20 04:15:43 2015 UTC,Roberson and Adams die or something?
Thunder,3dw9s4,Gettingbuckets,-4,Mon Jul 20 05:50:13 2015 UTC,No. Just making the same argument op was making for different players to show how nonsensical it is.   They could just stick Beverly or Ariza on Russ. We can put Adams on Dwight and Russ on Lawson when DJ is getting worked.   pointing out that positional defense is not a must. Lawson dosent have to guard Westbrook.   Edit: down vote all you want folks. Just shows how idiotic some thunder fans are. You can deal all the criticism you want but can't take it when it's sent your way.   Have the balls to reply and say why you disagree with a comment.

Thunder,3dw9s4,SeaworldOE,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:11:35 2015 UTC,"You said regardless of player, not Players on Rockets. Thats besides the point.   Durant did most of his work on Barnes.

Thunder,3dw9s4,SeaworldOE,2,Tue Jul 21 05:27:39 2015 UTC,With 2 DUIs in the past 6 months the guy should be putting a little bit more effort into taking care of himself rather than running a new offense.

Thunder,3dw9s4,JimLahey3,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:21:48 2015 UTC,The Rockets are a top tier team that got better this off-season. Keep in mind- Donatas Motiejūnas and Dwight haven't both been healthy yet.  Adding a good point guard makes the team even more formidable.
Thunder,3dw9s4,Root176400,3,Tue Jul 21 04:59:45 2015 UTC,The Houston Rockets will never be title contenders /NaCl
Thunder,3dw9s4,Desishuns,3,Mon Jul 20 03:15:17 2015 UTC,"Lawson handles the ball a lot and is poor on defense. Not exactly the perfect pairing to Harden but probably an upgrade. He is a wildcard because he has two DUIs which people are glossing over for some reason.   Basically their core ""big 3"" now is : Harden, Dwight, and Lawson.   Ehhhh I would put them as fifth in the west."
Thunder,3dw9s4,DaBear405,2,Mon Jul 20 02:01:34 2015 UTC,He's probably gonna come off the bench. Beverly is most likely going to start.
Thunder,3dw9s4,I_Smell_Panties,3,Mon Jul 20 03:33:07 2015 UTC,"Lawson, Jones, Brewer, Capela, Terry is a pretty good 2nd unit."
Thunder,3dw9s4,DoctorXX,1 point,Mon Jul 20 08:31:02 2015 UTC,"I still don't think they're title contenders. I think they got better but I'm unsure of how Lawson & Harden is going to work. Lawson is not that good of an off-ball player and Harden will definitely be their primary ball handler.   Don't get me wrong, they still added a really good player and are still a good team. Just not up there with us, Cleveland, Golden State, and San Antonio."
Thunder,3dw9s4,DevastationandReform,4,Mon Jul 20 02:20:07 2015 UTC,"Everybody said the same thing about the Cavs. Dont get me wrong, Lawson isnt Kyrie, but i think this move make them much much better.   Rockets filled their biggest hole, at the point. That automatically makes them better.   As for your point about not being up there with us, are we really up there with the other teams you listed? Our current roster hasnt even played 1 full healthy game and KD's health is a big question mark.   To me, Rockets are up there with us as championship contenders. Both teams have question marks but you cant say Rockets didnt get better."
Thunder,3dw9s4,Greas3dLightning,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:57:55 2015 UTC,He's obviously referring to us under the assumption that we're all healthy. It's a question about rosters not rosters with our guesses on the injuries they will suffer.
Thunder,3dw9s4,ayoshano,2,Mon Jul 20 12:38:36 2015 UTC,But why do the Rockets not improve after adding a guy that was top 3 in assists per game last couple of seasons and is a decent shooter?   Op seems to have 99% tint Homer glasses on. Rockets got much better.
Thunder,3dw9s4,Greas3dLightning,2,Mon Jul 20 13:24:31 2015 UTC,"As for your point about not being up there with us, are we really up there with the other teams you listed?   i was referring to this though, i didnt disagree about the rockets getting better.   Personally, I think they got better but I don't think it's enough to make them better than SAS, GSW, LAC and hopefully us. Our bench depth is a big worry for me."
Thunder,3dw9s4,ayoshano,0,Mon Jul 20 13:31:36 2015 UTC,"I can't dog Lawson as a player, but he better keep his nose clean if he wants to be a legitimate contributor in Houston. Guy decides to drunk drive again and gets in trouble again and he'll be lucky to have a job."

Thunder,3dw9s4,Greas3dLightning,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:56:54 2015 UTC,"I don't think so. They only made it to the WCF because the clippers crumbled under fatigue. Clips nearly destroyed them but the team fell apart. Haven't seen them mentioned in this thread but people seem to have forgotten they resigned DJ, plus they picked up Paul Pierce, Lance Stephenson and Josh Smith. That's a big step to solving their depth problems. With that solved, I think they are a better team than Houston.   Warriors are still Warriors, Spurs have Aldridge and become betting favourites again. Another offensive player/bad defender in Lawson doesn't suddenly make them better than these teams. We still trail in terms of depth too, but in terms of starter talent, there aren't any better than us."
Thunder,3dw9s4,ayoshano,0,Mon Jul 20 12:45:21 2015 UTC,"I would have gladly given up PJ, DJ, Dion, and Novak for Ty Lawson. Better than the shit haul they got from Houston. Gives us a solid scorer off the bench with a second team of Payne, Lawson, Singler, COllison, Adams, and McGary. We would be fine."

And who can forget their amazing front court depth of Cole Aldrich.

Thunder,3dsye3,JudgeJBS,4,Sun Jul 19 11:53:53 2015 UTC,"I see Spurs, Thunder, Warriors 1-3 in no particular order, depends on how the season goes. As for depth, I think it is the same 3 teams but I think it's Warriors, Thunder, then Spurs."
Thunder,3dsye3,dogfan20,2,Sun Jul 19 05:17:04 2015 UTC,"Its close between us and GS, but I think when healthy we are the deepest team in the league. Our front court depth is ridiculous especially if KD starts playing more at the 4, and we have multiple ball handlers with an added bonus if Payne plays well. We have a solid backup at every position and 2 at both center and point guard. GS has 9-10 average or better players but I honestly think we have 11-12."
Thunder,3dsye3,turnsaboots,3,Sun Jul 19 09:43:20 2015 UTC,"Who is your 8+?   I got Brodie, Morrow, Dre (for his D), Durant, Ibaka, Adams, Kanter.   I don't see how anyone else on our roster would really start or give 30+ min for any other team. Maybe DJ, MAYBE MAYBE MAYBE McGary in desperation situation.., at this point in his career (not that I don't have high hopes, I've had his jersey for a year now for the Thunder)"
Thunder,3dsye3,JudgeJBS,2,Sun Jul 19 12:01:15 2015 UTC,"I didn't mean that we have 11-12 guys who would play 30 mins a game somewhere, I just mean that all the way down to the end of the bench we have serviceable players. You mentioned 8 guys, Augustine, Collison, and Waiters make it 11. So our 12th guy is either Singler or Payne.  I feel like Collison/Waiters/Singler/Payne gives us the best end of the bench in the league when our starters are healthy. That's what I consider when thinking about how good a team's bench is."
Thunder,3dsye3,turnsaboots,2,Mon Jul 20 05:25:55 2015 UTC,"DJ could definitely play 30 minutes on a playoff team.  Waiters could play 30 minutes a game too but that would be a fringe playoff team or worse.  Roberson is the one that wouldn't see the light of day on most teams, he is a poor man's TA with better rebounding - aka a role player.  Regardless, there are at least 12 guys on our squad worthy of minutes on a contender (adding Collison and McGary), with 10 of them worthy of serious playtime.  That's as deep as you can get.  Most teams don't use more than 8 players in the playoffs unless they're making serious adjustments against a particular squad."

Huestis is a better shooter (or at least was in the D-League) and Huestis was drafted to be a 3-and-D guy. I think in the beginning Huestis will not dress for a lot of games and then we'll steadily put him in the lineups. If Roberson keeps shooting ~25% on threes, I don't see why we wouldn't give Huestis a shot when we don't need a proven wing defender (Like when we play the Grizzlies or Clippers)."
Thunder,3dh9og,bearfish102,3,Sun Jul 19 01:03:57 2015 UTC,I think Huestis will be signed on the roster but will spend  alot of time in the D league like Mcgary last year and then see how he does during games.

Thunder,3dh9og,srbb3,2,Thu Jul 16 07:27:30 2015 UTC,Pretty much this. Novak is the designated DNP if he is still here but he saves us like $10MM in salary and tax just by trading him away for nothing.
Thunder,3dh9og,Riptide_,2,Thu Jul 16 13:28:28 2015 UTC,Yeah there's absolutely no way Huestis will take Singlers spot barring injury. Singler will dress every game.

Thunder,3ddj5t,AIMpb,4,Wed Jul 15 16:58:13 2015 UTC,"Cooks' stats for 10-11 are actually pretty good. 43% FG, 42% 3-Pt, 80% FT. Yeah, only 5 PPG in 14 mins a game, but still not too bad, pretty efficient clip from beyond the arc"
Thunder,3ddj5t,lottabullets,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:04:32 2015 UTC,"Yeah, he was the best. Such a great bench piece."
Thunder,3ddj5t,AIMpb,3,Wed Jul 15 17:10:31 2015 UTC,I think I'll actually miss PJ3. Have to trade him on 2K MyGM now to sustain OKC's roster to make it as close to real as possible.
Thunder,3ddj5t,Slendyla_IV,2,Wed Jul 15 17:42:39 2015 UTC,"Sadly Marcus Smart doesn't have the intelligence to be a superstar, let alone a legend."

Thunder,3ddj5t,TheHandyman1,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:37:39 2015 UTC,"I'm a guy that attended OSU with him. He has no work ethic and no ambition. Maybe he's changed idk, I wish him all the best tho. But a legend is far from where he will end up"
Thunder,3ddj5t,MichealR24,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:00:07 2015 UTC,I'm a guy that went to OSU with him. Never saw him off court much except for at the Union eating. But all I saw was the same hustle and drive on court that I saw with Markel when I played with him.
Thunder,3ddj5t,TheHandyman1,7,Thu Jul 16 15:21:58 2015 UTC,"Hopefully Brad Stevens will play him more. We always talk about confidence being his issue, and significant minutes with a developing young team could do a lot for him."
Thunder,3ddj5t,Istanbuldayim,4,Wed Jul 15 13:23:21 2015 UTC,RIP bench cheering mob.
Thunder,3ddj5t,dbthelinguaphile,4,Wed Jul 15 14:34:34 2015 UTC,I always think of this https://instagram.com/p/kc1HNXB-Y_/  Still hope he gets a chance to do the dunk contest one year.

Thunder,3ddj5t,hustl3tree5,3,Thu Jul 16 03:52:21 2015 UTC,"people talk about him having one good game vs the clippers and defending Lebron that one time which is very disrespectful.  He started last season like a beast through the first 5 games (EDIT stats below) before he got injured. In my opinion we had a perfect foil for Durant already on the roster, but i am just happy to see him get some pt somewhere else. There were rookies drafted this year that are older than him.  32.9-mins, 45.8-fg%, 33.3-3pt%, 73.7-ft%, 3.8-rbs, 1.2-ast, 0.4-stl, 0.2-blk, 2.2-to, 15.0-ppg  This was my biggest fear about paying Kanter that any combination of PJ3, Lamb and Augustine could be shipped off for purely tax reasons."
Thunder,3ddj5t,Gettingbuckets,2,Thu Jul 16 00:29:41 2015 UTC,"I for one am stoked he's going to Boston. I've been quoted on here as preaching how much the ""family"" aspect of this organization rings, what with jeremy and reggie both going places where they'll get a chance. The same thing just happened to Perry, he literally fell in to what I would consider one of the three best spots he could have been. I'm not sure the eastern conference is ready for the wrath of Perry, jeremy, and reggie next year. Excited to see them play."
Thunder,3ddj5t,Andrewbooboo,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:18:23 2015 UTC,"Sorry I'm late, PJ3.  I couldn't bring myself to cope with the fact that we lost you so young. I remember when we drafted you right after our finals appearance. You were a steal that late in the draft!  Maybe it was the pressure of coming into a situation with so much focus and drive to win a title. You were fresh out of school; we can't blame you. You had your chance a couple of times to grow with the team, but you just never really did. More often than I want to admit, I watched the remainder of games that went into garbage time just to see if you and our other young guys were improving.   Hopefully you do pretty good for yourself in Boston."
Thunder,3ddj5t,DoctorXX,1 point,Thu Jul 16 08:39:33 2015 UTC,Loved the Show him and lamb put on when they were on the bench i had some great laughs....Tons of talent and potiential i Hope the best for him in Boston.
Thunder,3ddj5t,MichealR24,0,Thu Jul 16 13:29:23 2015 UTC,Well Pdawg i always expected more out of you but you never really delivered. As a person I hope you find happiness but as a basketball player I hope you flop because you are now competing directly against the Thunder.
Thunder,3dfhaj,TheHandyman1,12,Wed Jul 15 21:23:12 2015 UTC,"I'd call him a luxury in a sense.  If this year wasn't a huge championship window and KD's contract was secure, I think we would have let him walk without question.  Signing him was a move that said we are going to pay what we need to pay to give us the best shot at winning a title this year, even if it's going to cost us a lot more than we want to pay."
Thunder,3dfhaj,Roy30,4,Wed Jul 15 21:55:38 2015 UTC,"I agree with the reason you said we signed him (championship window, keeping KD, etc) but for those same reasons, I would consider him a necessity. In a few years, when he opts out early, he will be a luxury and we probably won't resign him."
Thunder,3dfhaj,HeatB719,7,Wed Jul 15 23:33:21 2015 UTC,This assumes that we sub 5-people with 5-people.   It never goes that way.   I think it's more likely that KD subs out first (to reduce minutes) + Kanter (+1) come in. Then we try to exploit the Kanter/Russ PnR for the rest of the 1st quarter.
Thunder,3dfhaj,okctHunder11,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:29:58 2015 UTC,"Right, I didn't even mean to assume that. I kind of like your idea if Kanter comes off the bench, which is something I just don't think will happen. Actually now that you point it out, it's kind of hard to think about haha, we have no idea how Donovan will sub. You could pretty much get within 5 seconds of when Brooks would sub."
Thunder,3dfhaj,PudgeCat,4,Wed Jul 15 23:53:18 2015 UTC,"If you watched any of the games where Adams started he was ALWAYS the first one to the bench. Either foul trouble or matchups not working or fatigue or whatever the case he was always the first one. So I imagine the starting five being something like Russ Waiters/Morrow/Roberson KD Serge Adams  Adams goes to the bench first, Kanter comes in and scores a million points runnin pick n rolls with Russ til the end of the first, then you gotta get creative with the full second unit....we'll see."
Thunder,3dfhaj,DaBear405,3,Thu Jul 16 03:50:47 2015 UTC,Yes Royce is right
Thunder,3dfhaj,srbb3,3,Wed Jul 15 22:31:07 2015 UTC,"I thin we are looking at a platoon system. The way kanter dominated the first half last year, I think he should play most of the first quarter, which will allow durant to kind of ease into the game. It's all about managing their minutes and I see them being pretty close to splitting time at center."
Thunder,3dfhaj,HeatB719,4,Thu Jul 16 02:05:30 2015 UTC,"I have seen Royce say he thinks Kanter will be our 6th man but I don't buy it. First, you don't pay someone 17 million a year to be a bench player. Secondly, Kanter would not like that move and it would probably create a riff between him and the team. Additionally, and it goes back to a point you made, hiding Kanter's defense is way easier with the first unit than the second. Russ/Roberson/KD/Serge/Kanter could be a decent defense. DJ/Waiters/Morrow/Collison/Kanter sounds like a disaster. Granted they wouldn't do a 5 in, 5 out deal but still.   As to Kanter being a luxury, I don't see it that way. He is a legit threat to score from the low post if not doubled regardless of who is guarding him. He adds a necessary dimension to our team. If we had low post scoring without him, I would say he is a luxury. But the skill set that he has on the offensive end will make us very dangerous and a more complete team."
Thunder,3dfhaj,JudgeJBS,5,Wed Jul 15 21:49:05 2015 UTC,"No, but you do pay ~$12 mil a year to be a bench player, which is essentially what we will be paying him taking into account the new TV deal."
Thunder,3dfhaj,HeatB719,3,Wed Jul 15 22:54:35 2015 UTC,"It's 13.4 million or something like that if you want to take the cap adjusted amount after the jump but I'm not going to split hairs on that point.   Personally I've never seen him as a good fit with the second unit, so I would be shocked if he came off the bench. I guess what really matters though is the rotation, so we will see what happens. Scotty was terrible at managing a rotation, so hopefully Billy can bring some value there and put everyone in a position to be successful"
Thunder,3dfhaj,MichealR24,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:31:03 2015 UTC,He's definately a luxury player...coming off the bench he won't have to guard skilled players all the time like Demarcus cousins that would embarrass him on the defensive end. He'll come off the bench give the 2nd unit a much needed offensive spark. I assume we'll see alot of Augustin and Kanter pick and roll offense on the 2nd unit. This is the most stacked team we've ever had and putting Kanter on the floor with Ibaka or Adams leaves alot of room for error on the defensive end. Unless his defense dramatically changes I see the thunder parting ways with him like they did Perkins as soon as they can.  Billy D had a gift of winning at Florida and having players buy into his system I have no doubt he will do it again here.
Thunder,3dfhaj,The405Kid,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:20:49 2015 UTC,I for one am hoping billy d won't be so hard headed with his line ups as Brooks was. Stagger the line ups or play the match up with adams & kanter. Some coaching flexibility would go along way considering Brooks you could set your watch to his rotations.
