She gets seriously, disgustingly sick for days from even the slightest cross-contamination.    People regularly make fun of her with shit like this, and then claim that she can't possibly have a real dietary allergy, because dietary allergies simply aren't real, and don't exist.  She has had people deliberately cross contaminate her food, to ""prove"" she was faking or making it up.  They basically come right out and accuse her of being a pretentious person who is trying to be difficult, or something.    The idea that she is pretentious is totally unreal, just by taking a look at how how casual and down to earth she is, or by spending even a few moments talking to her.  But people like to have reasons to mock, judge, and insult people they don't know.  The complications from this, before it was diagnosed, caused one of her other health problems to snowball, and led to her having a serous blood clotting problem that almost killed her twice.  She almost lost a leg from a blood clot, and had a stroke.    I'm not a doctor so I don't know exactly how the gluten goods tied into the medical problem that made the blood clotting worse, but I know she now has to be really paranoid about both issues, and when anything causes one of the health problems to flair up, the other one immediately follows.  So, the conclusion?  Don't be a dick, and do this to people.  There really are people out there who have to incredibly careful about gluten, so that can stay healthy, or so that they stay alive.  And, unfortunately, the number of those people seems to be growing."

Point to a verse.  Read that verse aloud and then add the phrase, ""On ya titties.""    I have not yet found a Bible verse which is not rendered hilarious in this way.  Here's an example taken from bibledice.com (the random scripture generator).

Gary hopes to advance in Hell, but he may be too stupid, lazy and kind-hearted to realize his dreams of promotion.

funnysigns,3361hx,Just_Some_Man,4,Mon Apr 20 00:07:52 2015 UTC,That's definitely not the issue. It's correctly spelled macaron. A macaroon looks like this.   $2 * 6 macarons = $12.00. Sign says $12.50.
funnysigns,3361hx,sailorsun777,6,Mon Apr 20 01:03:34 2015 UTC,Sign says $12.50.   For a giftbox.  There are singles for $2 or a giftbox with 6 for $12.50.

funnysigns,3361hx,sdec,1 point,Mon Apr 20 00:42:54 2015 UTC,It's $12.50 for a giftbox of 6.  You can get 6 singles for $12 or a giftbox of 6 for $0.50 more.
funnysigns,3361hx,spikeyfreak,2,Mon Apr 20 01:15:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I don't see anything wrong with it. It's possible they are just trying to nickle and dime people so that they don't eat the cost of the gift box. But if they sell 15, they make enough of a profit they don't need to charge more for the box."
funnysigns,3361hx,HoustonBrooke,1 point,Mon Apr 20 02:33:48 2015 UTC,"perhaps, but then why isn't the 15-pc $30.50?  And those are definitely macarons, so it's not the spelling. Maybe just a bad value..."
funnysigns,3361hx,sdec,1 point,Mon Apr 20 01:49:02 2015 UTC,why isn't the 15-pc $30.50?   The more you buy the cheaper they are.  The gift box probably costs more than $0.50.

Ok, so i checked something here and came to the conclusion that they DID use google translate. If you write ""Дзвони руками не чіпати"" without the exclamation mark - then it translates to ""Do not touch Bells"", BUT, if you add ""!"" at the end it will translate into this - ""Bells Do not touch!"".

There are several types of squat toilets, but they all consist essentially of an opening in the floor. The only exception is a ""pedestal"" squat toilet, which is of the same height as a sitting toilet. It is also possible to squat over sitting toilets, but this requires extra care as they are not specifically designed for squatting.  Squat toilets are commonly found in Asia, Middle East, South America, North Africa, some parts of sub-Saharan Africa, and to some extent in Southern Europe, although they are getting less common there. Squat toilets are not common in Central and Northern Europe, North America, Japan, Australia.  It may be a Flush toilet with water that should receive Wastewater treatment, a Urine-diverting dry toilet, a Composting toilet, an Arborloo for later planting trees, a Pit latrine, but hopefully not perched over an open body of water.

funnysigns,2x3zrc,Garybomb,4,Wed Feb 25 15:20:26 2015 UTC,"PET bottle recycling:       Bottles made of polyethylene terephthalate (PET, sometimes PETE) can be ""recycled"" to reuse the material out of which they are made and to reduce the amount of waste going into landfills. PET is semiporous and absorbs molecules of the food or beverage contained, and the residue is difficult to remove. Heating the plastic enough for sterilization would destroy it. Most recycled bottles are therefore used to make lower grade products, such as carpets. To make a food grade plastic, the bottles need to be hydrolysed down to monomers, which are purified and then re-polymerised to make new PET. Beverage company Naked Juice switched their line to recycled PET (rPET) packaging in 2009.  In many countries, PET plastics are coded with the resin identification code number ""1"" inside the universal recycling symbol, usually located on the bottom of the container.

I had an older man come in a while back, asking for a book ""by a female writer who lives in Canada"". That's it. That's all he knew. No title, no idea what the book was about, nothing. ""Can't you just put in ""female"" or ""Canada?"" He asks when we explain to him that we don't have a reliable search method without more information. No, sir, that is not how it works. Our books are in no way filed by the author's sex or geographical location. Our computers are not mystics and can not see through time and space, to go back and figure out what book it was that you managed to forget every relevant detail about."

funnysigns,2jfqii,EorEquis,5,Thu Oct 16 19:35:06 2014 UTC,"Here's the thing. You said a ""jackdaw is a crow."" Is it in the same family? Yes. No one's arguing that. As someone who is a scientist who studies crows, I am telling you,   specifically, in science, no one calls jackdaws crows. If you want to be ""specific"" like you said, then you   shouldn't either. They're not the same thing. If you're saying ""crow family"" you're referring to the taxonomic grouping of Corvidae, which   includes things from nutcrackers to blue jays to ravens. So your reasoning for calling a jackdaw a crow is because random people ""call the black ones   crows?"" Let's get grackles and blackbirds in there, then, too. Also, calling someone a human or an ape? It's not one or the other, that's not how taxonomy works.   They're both. A jackdaw is a jackdaw and a member of the crow family. But that's not what you said.   You said a jackdaw is a crow, which is not true unless you're okay with   calling all members of the crow family crows, which means you'd call blue jays, ravens, and other   birds crows, too. Which you said you don't. It's okay to just admit you're wrong, you know?"

The purpose of the stratum corneum is to form a barrier to protect underlying tissue from infection, dehydration, chemicals and mechanical stress. Desquamation, the process of cell shedding from the surface of the stratum corneum, balances proliferating keratinocytes that form in the stratum basale. These cells migrate through the epidermis towards the surface in a journey that takes approximately fourteen days.

The term ‘wang-wang’ is a street lingo for blaring sirens.  Presidential Decree No. 96 was issued on January 13, 1973 by former President Ferdinand Marcos, regulating the use of sirens, bells, whistles, horns and other similar devices only to motor vehicles designated for the use of the President, Vice President, Senate President, House Speaker, Chief Justice, Philippine National Police, Armed Forces of the Philippines, National Bureau of Investigation, Land Transportation Office, Bureau of Fire Protection and ambulances.   However, despite having the privilege of using ‘wang-wang’, Aquino maintained he would set the example for his no ‘wang-wang’ policy, not to use ‘wang-wang’, even if it means being stuck in traffic and being late every now and then.   Aquino also traded the official black presidential Mercedes Benz S-Guard limousine for a white Toyota Land Cruiser 200.  After the inaugural address, the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority began to enforce Aquino's no ‘wang-wang’ policy, confiscating ‘wang-wang’ from public officials and private motorists who illegally used them.
