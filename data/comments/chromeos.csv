Intel topping pretty much everything else barring i3's and better in Chromebooks. Clock speed shouldn't be an issue. All that being said, all of these Chromebooks should be more than suitable for your needs.  I think it comes down to personal preference, really. Design and I/O are probably the most important things to consider. Other than that, unless you can get yourself a Dell 11 with an i3, any of them should be a pretty great choice."
chromeos,3e3kv5,DavidA122,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:55:25 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your input! I've been leaning towards the Asus, because of the bigger screen, but then I saw how little price difference there was been the Asus and Acer, so I started wondering if the specs on the Acer were better.  The thing that's most important to me is that the one I do get won't stutter. My current laptop is driving me insane with how slow it is to start up the browser, and in general load pages. So I want to make as sure as I can that the Chromebook I choose can keep up. Which has been a bit hard to determine with different reports on this sub. So thanks for your comment!"

It is a little hard to imagine going down to an 11.6 inch, but then again, I'd rather have a smaller screen, on a laptop with better performing hardware inside, which I can then connect to an external screen. Rather that than a bigger screen, but lesser hardware."

chromeos,3e3ley,figureitout2002,2,Tue Jul 21 18:16:49 2015 UTC,"The i5 model is more suited for those people who plan to run heavy-duty programs via Linux, as there are very few things you could do on a Chromebook that an i5 could handle that an i3 couldn't. Extra performance is always a great thing, as it's better to have performance to spare just in case you need it in the future, but for most people the i3 would be perfectly suitable and will save people a little bit of money.  If the difference in price isn't that big a deal, you might as well go for the i5 anyway, then you have the best of the best for the C910 in case you do ever need to use some sort of CPU intensive program in the future."
chromeos,3e3ley,DavidA122,2,Tue Jul 21 18:49:04 2015 UTC,There is very little difference between the i3 and i5 in the c910/cb15.  The i5 is clocked 0.2GHz higher and can technically boost clock. And its GPU clock is 900mHz instead of 850mHz. Not sure if the slight bumps are worth like an extra 100$
chromeos,3e3ley,mrevankyle,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:30:33 2015 UTC,"Where would you say the practical cutoff is in terms of noticeably faster performance on Chrome OS? Everyone seems to say that their chromebooks are much faster than other PCs that they've used, but I've tried CBs with the Exynos 5800, N2830, and a while back, the N2955. I can't really remember how quick the N2955 was, but even in basic web browsing nothing seems to come close to my i7-equipped laptop. If I want to see performance comparable to that laptop, should I be looking at i3s?"
chromeos,3e3ley,genericbeing,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:46:55 2015 UTC,Thank you.  Yeah the i5 is $50 more than the i3 for the C910.
chromeos,3e41vv,DrunkFishBreatheAir,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:08:40 2015 UTC,"First, all of the mentioned Chromebooks are excellent performers, and you probably won't notice any difference in everyday performance between them.  The C720 i3 will score just a bit higher on Google's Octane test over the C740, but we're talking about scores that aren't noticeable.  Obviously, the big difference with the C910 is the screen size.  I think Acer said an i3 C740 would eventually be available, but I don't think it's been released."
chromeos,3e41vv,baseballandfreedom,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:51:19 2015 UTC,"I guess I should have specified that I used to own a C720 and am deciding whether to get another or to upgrade to an i3, a C740, or a C910 (I don't care about the bigger screen, performance would be my only consideration).  I run linux and wouldn't mind running mathematica inside of it, so the C720 was fairly low powered for what I want but was enough if the others aren't a worthwhile upgrade."

I didn't find the c910 enough faster to matter much in causal use with just a few tabs open. The c910 was much better with lots of tabs open and has a much nicer display than the c720.
chromeos,3e2fbz,Profile3D,4,Tue Jul 21 13:02:25 2015 UTC,"The low cost option is the Asus M004U Celeron for less than $160 USD.  You can upgrade (DIY) both the RAM and SSD  for a reasonable cost. 4 USB.  No USB3 though, HDMI and DVI ports, SD slot and Ethernet port.  Wifi and Bluetooth.  If you need speed, go for the 3i models."
chromeos,3e2fbz,claude_j_greengrass,3,Tue Jul 21 14:13:54 2015 UTC,"Just as an aside, the M004U Celeron does have 4 USB 3.0 ports (two front, two rear).  I've had a great experience with mine.  Certainly, an i3 couldn't hurt; but the Celeron 2995U hasn't given me any reason to complain; particularly at the price point.    The only caution I'd extend is that if you do upgrade the RAM you will need ""PC3L"" 1.35V low voltage chips.  Regular 1.5V DDR3 SO-DIMMs won't work.  Not an expensive upgrade at ~$26 to add 4GB (Newegg's current price on the Crucial CT51264BF160BJ); for a total of 6GB."

It's not an extreme price jump from the i3, but it will for sure be future-proof, and have absolutely no problems running 25+ tabs. If mobility is something that you are not concerned with, I would recommend the the Asus M075U Chromebox. It comes with 4Gb of ram, 16Gb SSD, core i3, plus a wireless keyboard and mouse included, all for $248.99. Also most components are upgradeable as well."

chromeos,3e0hzj,VictoryGoth,5,Tue Jul 21 00:39:18 2015 UTC,How's the quality of the panel vs the Toshiba CB2? Nice purchase! Which colour did you get it in? :)
chromeos,3e0hzj,Charged_Buffalo,3,Tue Jul 21 02:44:56 2015 UTC,"I got the black version. I would have preferred the white one, but the black one I bought was the cheapest refurbished one I could find. The black still looks nice, though.  The display resolution makes everything crystal-clear. Chrome OS at Full HD is great at this screen size; no weird scaling issues like you get on 13"" FHD Chromebooks. (This is why I keep my Toshiba Chromebook 2 at 1536x864).  HOWEVER, colors and contrast are unimpressive right out of the box. I would suggest anyone with this Chromebase to calibrte the display the moment you first start it up. After some playing around I was able to get the contrast, black level and color temperature pretty close to my Toshiba CB2. Otherwise, LG's screen compares favorably to the Toshiba."

chromeos,3e0hzj,ilikestripes,3,Tue Jul 21 01:13:08 2015 UTC,"First Impressions:   The display is fantastic! Everything is crystal-clear, and Chrome OS looks great at this screen size and resolution (21.5"" at 1920x1080). Chrome OS definitely looks too small on my Toshiba Chromebook 2, which is why I changed the resolution to 1536x864 on my Chromebook. HOWEVER, colors and constrast aren't that good right out of the box. I would suggest anyone with this Chromebase to change the Constrast to 80, the Black Level to Low, and change to Gamma 2. I also raised the Red to 55 on the Color Temp option, and in the Six Color option, I raised Magenta to 55. This is because I'm used to the Toshiba CB2's warmer display, and if I hadn't made these specific Color Temperature changes, my Chromebase would look too blue in comparison. Build Quality: The whole thing feels extremely cheap. The display is very wobbly. Typing really hard on the keyboard will make the display shake a little, and even smacking my hand on the desk lightly causes it to shake. It's kind of disappointing. :( Keyboard and Mouse: I like the keyboard. It feels solid and I like the way typing feels. The keys have a good amount of depth and they also have a softer click to them. The mouse feels very cheap and extremely hollow, but it's surprisingly comfortable in my hand.  Speakers: MEH. Even if the display itself is cranked to 100% volume and I also have the OS at 100% volume, it's rather quiet. And everything sounds super muffled. Also, if I'm not using the speakers, I have to just put the Chromebase on mute, because the speakers make a low static sound when audio isn't playing.  Headphone use: I thought I should note that when you plug headphones in, you're going to hear static coming through. But once you start playing audio it goes away. Overall impression: Despite the negatives I've listed here, I definitely like the Chromebase a lot. It's so awesome to have Chrome OS on a big, 1080p display, and I definitely prefer the all-in-one setup to having to fuss with a Chromebox and separate monitor. I have a Windows desktop strictly for Photoshop, so I'll be using my Chromebase as a monitor for that, too. Once I feel like working on one of my Photoshop projects I'll update on how the Chromebase works as a second display. Anyway, overall, it's basically just what you'd expect from a Chrome OS device. You can tell where the corners were cut, but thankfully LG didn't cut any corners when it came to the most important aspect of the Chromebase: its display. I would say its flaws are easily forgivable.    Edit: Typos and stuff."
chromeos,3e0hzj,C2OO,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:51:48 2015 UTC,I've read using the included mouse results in some kind of audio noise. Maybe that's the static you're hearing. Try using a different mouse.

chromeos,3e07p5,iSOregon,5,Tue Jul 21 03:03:06 2015 UTC,"The HDMI port is an output-only port, to the dismay of a few people I've seen in this sub. Basically, you can use this port to:   Extend your screen using additional monitors next to your Chromebook, i.e. As a desktop setup. Mirror your screen to a projector, e.g. for a class/office presentation. To cast your screen to another display, for say using a TV as your screen instead of the laptop and using wireless keyboards and mice.   The port works like any HDMI port on a PC would. What you can use it for is limited by the tech you own and the uses you can think of, really."
chromeos,3e07p5,DavidA122,4,Tue Jul 21 01:08:18 2015 UTC,"This is something that has been on virtually every notebook/laptop computer since time began. I can't see how this is much of a surprise just because it is a Chromebook.  My first notebook computers only had the good Ole' VGA port.  I actually had one that had an even older style SVideo port. Next came the DVI port and now, finally the HDMI port.  Pretty much all newer monitors and TV's have HDMI inputs on them making the Chromebook very relevant.  Of course there are many 3rd party adapters that will take the HDMI port and 'down convert' so to speak, to a DVI or a VGA port.  This is mainly only necessary to connect to older presentation projectors.  Schools, corporations and offices style settings seem to keep old technology until they break!"

If you really want to replace it, BE CAREFUL WHEN BUYING A SCREEN. You have to buy a replacement screen for the exact model of the laptop, because the placement of the pins or whatever may be different on other 13.3"" FHD screens. As it happens, replacement screens for this Chromebook are about $100. So, you could sacrifice an extra $230 to just buy a brand new one, or you can save $230 on a repair that may be a tad risky. Good luck."
chromeos,3e0jzv,VictoryGoth,2,Tue Jul 21 03:20:03 2015 UTC,"The video linked above looks like it could be used to replace the screen on the CB2.  I've changed plenty of laptop screens and the fact the hinge layout and bezel look the same leads me to have some confidence that it should be very similar.  There are no screews in the hinge assembly so the plug should be screen side and not in the base, as some laptops are.  I, personally, would 100% go for the screen replacement BUT it's totally dependent on your skill and confidence level.  All in all though this definitely looks one of the easier ones to replace.  /u/VictoryGoth thanks for that video."

chromeos,3e0ec6,Zep1991,3,Tue Jul 21 00:09:36 2015 UTC,"Performance wise, the Acer 13 and the TCB2 are just about on par with each other now, after a lot of optimisation for the Tegra K1 chip. So, with that in mind, the decision really comes down to the great screen of the TCB2 vs. the battery life and keyboard of the Acer 13.  You won't find anything as good as the TCB2's screen on any laptop at the same price and still have the same sort of performance. It's a great screen and will make any other Chromebook look like it's 10 years old. So, if visuals are really important to you, then it's a no brainer for the Toshiba.  However, if a 13+ hour battery life and arguably one of the best keyboards in ChromeOS are more your style, then the Acer 13 should be your choice. The Acer is also, in my opinion, one of the better designed Chromebooks and is more aesthetically pleasing than the TCB2. I'd maybe recommend a skin or something though, because the white will show dirt a lot more than the Toshiba will.  If you check out eBay there are a few good deals on the Acer, including refurbished units at a pretty good knockdown price, and a number of redditors here have found these deals to be great."

chromeos,3dyjv7,astrowayne,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:38:22 2015 UTC,Depends on the processor- I've got a model with i3 and I haven't noticed a difference when 15 are open. ( I don't use more than that).  Battery is incredible. I can work on 50% light for 8 hours straight. I don't take my charge cable when I leave the house with it.
chromeos,3dyjv7,omgasnake,4,Mon Jul 20 17:51:57 2015 UTC,"I was pretty much in the same position, got a CB for Christmas and now am I in love with it (Toshiba CB2). I have a 2011 MBP and it's definitely showing its age, so I have been using my CB2 with about a 40-60 split, and foresee it moving more and more to the CB until I replace the MBP. Make no mistake, I will always be using my CB it's not some stopgap until I replace my MBP. I pretty much do what you want to do. I use my MBP for essays, web surfing, and other Mac-exclusive programs while I use the Toshiba CB2 for a lot of web-surfing and portability for when I travel. CB's are all super lightweight and are the BEST option for travelling around. Super portable. I like my CB2 because it's so portable and can leave it in a room pop it open to google a few things (FAQs, IMDB for a movie, reddit, etc.) whereas my MBP stays hooked up to a monitor in my room. The CB2 is super fast, looks great, and has phenomenal battery life.   I don't really game at all as I have a console for that, but I would not get any CB expecting gaming other than browser games. Relegate gaming to whatever other computer you get.  I would say the biggest headache is file management on CB's because it's a little different than traditional file management on other computers because there is so little internal storage and it's all in the cloud. To answer your question, you can arrange on the USB. It's gets a little hairy when going from laptop to CB, but it's not really confusing just foreign.  I can only recommend whole-heartedly the Toshiba CB2 with the 1080p screen."
chromeos,3dyjv7,omgasnake,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:51:08 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply. Yeah I have a PS4 for games, and a couple handhelds if I ever want thought I was getting a great deal on that laptop until I realised much of it is wasted (and 550 seems a bit much just to play RTC or Rome 2). My current one seems to be chugging along fairly well for its age.  One question about your CB2 - is the battery removable? Not really a deal breaker as I'm guessing that CBs are cheap enough to just replace in however many years it takes to wear it out, but it's good to know anyway."
chromeos,3dyjv7,RedStag86,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:29:20 2015 UTC,AFAIK not removable.
chromeos,3dyjv7,NXSection31,3,Mon Jul 20 19:07:59 2015 UTC,"Instead of looking for a 32GB Chromebook, I would suggest utilizing the SD card slot to expand your storage. I believe most Chromebooks will take up to a 128GB SD card (check your model). If you're worried about the SD card sticking out, there are ways around that. Some Chromebooks have a deep SD slot to keep the card flush with the Chromebook. You also have the option of getting a half-sized microSD adapter that will be flush and go that route."
chromeos,3dyjv7,oxeneers,2,Mon Jul 20 19:02:30 2015 UTC,"Long essays, short essays doesn't matter... A chromebook is capable of everything BUT gaming and high level coding/video editing.  You can create folders on the hard disk, an external disk, your google drive account, etc.  Personally, I just use the 100 gigs on my drive account so I have access to anything and everything. The only issue you may run into is printing. Some older printers are really finicky when it comes to Chrome, but I use my CB for Grad School in an intensive, writing focused program and I'd never go back to Windows. Once you have a computer that never really slows down or gets viruses, you won't want to go back."
chromeos,3dyjv7,denniskempin,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:35:54 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you hit the nail on the head here.  Although, I would probably mention that for writing APA-style papers, Google Docs/Drive is not the best. They only just recently added the basic ability to use a unique header for the first page.   If you rely heavily on PDF-sorting software like Mendeley or ReadCube like I do, Google Docs is difficult to use for writing papers since it does not offer any plugin support to those programs - at the moment. But past that, it does its job well.  Now, if I could just find a Chromebook with an incredible keyboard..."
chromeos,3dyjv7,giraffe_taxi,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:30:09 2015 UTC,Thanks. I wasn't aware that you could create folders! I thought they just got lumped into the download folder. It would have helped if the local computer shop actually had any I could have used.
chromeos,3dyjv7,vozi45,2,Mon Jul 20 17:39:31 2015 UTC,"If you are wondering whether a Chromebook will have enough functionality for you to work, try using just Chrome on your current laptop.

If all you want to do can be done comfortably in Chrome, you'll be very happy with a Chromebook."
chromeos,3dyjv7,giraffe_taxi,2,Mon Jul 20 17:46:15 2015 UTC,"Maxing out the SSD on a Chromebook is kind of missing the point, tbh. They can easily meet the needs you describe, but you'll get the most out of it if you be a bit flexible about changing your workflow.   You can test this out on your current hardware, btw. Just start using Google Drive for online storage. For $2/mo you get 100 GB on top of whatever the default/free drive storage space is. My current Drive space is over 200 GB. Keep in mind that you can now get new Chromebooks for $150, so even kicking in $10/mo for the 1 TB of online storage for 3 years will still be cheaper than your Lenovo laptop, which is subject to local hardware failure.   Organizing files in folders is of course doable on Drive.   So test this use case out. Start minimizing your use of local storage for anything but backup. Start using google docs for your writing & document creation needs. Test the conversion among file types -- it supports .docx and other MS Office file structures.  If you find that this workflow meets your needs, than you're going to have an easy transition to a Chromebook."

chromeos,3duyl6,VictoryGoth,20,Sun Jul 19 18:54:42 2015 UTC,They're already building (horrible) Android laptops to that price point so it's just a matter of time until someone loads one with ChromeOS.
chromeos,3duyl6,Gargenville,10,Sun Jul 19 20:00:09 2015 UTC,"Well, regardless, Chrome OS is so much better suited for a laptop form factor than Android is. Android laptops have always been horrible, no matter how good the specs, because Android is not a desktop OS, it's best in smartphones and tablets. This is probably why Google invented Chrome OS in the first place. I think even a super cheap $99 Chromebook would be better than any Android laptop. It wouldn't be the best Chrome OS experience or anything, but I don't think it would be horrible."

Smaller screen and resolution 8.9 inch (1024x600). Atom processor. Similar SSD 4Gb + 16Gb.  Only 1Gb RAM. Cramped keyboard.  Less battery capacity, maybe 5 hr.  WIFI and Blootooth. No Cloud storage so no Sync.  DIY updates.   With 20-20 hindsight, I would say that a $99 Chromebook is possible, but the keyboard, case, and battery will suffer. Low end compute h/w should be possible given the three year evolution of CB's from the Samsung ARM XE303C12 vs the not quite 1 years old Toshiba CB 2.  Price stays constant and the hardware spec improves, or you can pay less and get less.  I'll skip the race to the bottom."

chromeos,3dvs2t,solonicity,2,Mon Jul 20 00:05:08 2015 UTC,"No, they are not mostly vga only. Only older low-end monitors are. Even slightly better older ones have dvi.  You do NOT want to use vga if possible - it is analogue and the chromebook puts out only a digital signal.   You want in order:   1) 1 type of digital direct cable, no conversion. So hdmi (or displayport as on chromebox and others) direct to the same type port. Only 2 options: hdmi-hdmi always there on chromeOS device so just by that the easiest, or displayport-displayport as some chromeOS devices have.  Well, then the pixel only does C out but few if any C monitors yet. Eventually maybe they'll usually be C-C.  2) any possible digital to digital conversion you can manage, including dvi to displayport or hdmi. Many older monitors have dvi and vga. Use the dvi, it's digital. (Then you learn there are various types of dvi! It MUST have the long dash-like pin on one side which means digital (dvi-d), or with 4 extra pins around it that's capable of even higher rez (dvi-i = dvi-d+dvi-a). There's also the matter of number of pins in the clusters but that never came up as mine had I think 9+9. Only issues are at higher rez. Again the Pixel is special with only C out but you order a C-HDMI or C-displayport with it.  3) vga to digital using an ACTIVE converter. On amazon search for ""vga adapter"" and chromebook  or chromebox or samsung, and you can search the comments at the bottom. Get one that people mention works perfectly on chromeOS.  A basic cable with adapters will NOT work. It needs a chip to convert the signal. Even then many people report issues at various rez. I found a few types people always said worked perfectly.   4) to be clear: a basic cable with a vga adapter on one end will NOT work. Do not buy it. So option 4 is a black monitor :)  Yes, I just spent tons of time figuring out all this for an office."

chromeos,3dv2vj,Turntaker,0,Sun Jul 19 21:53:45 2015 UTC,The thing with chromebooks is you need to make sacrifices. (otherwise you need to spend $1000 on an ultrabook)  Some chromebooks have good performance but not amazing battery life and/or screen.  Acer c720 is the best performing in its price category but certainly does not have the best battery/screen. If battery is an issue then you need to sacrifice performance. Id say if you are only web browsing and doing light things just stick to Toshiba chromebook 2. I am going to code and game on mine so performance was important. You will get 7-8 hours in chrome os.

chromeos,3dvbup,THE-REDKNIGHT-1,6,Sun Jul 19 20:47:02 2015 UTC,"Hey there, thanks for posting.  The bad news here is that you're likely completely out of luck. Chromebooks used in schools are typically enrolled in the Chrome management console, which allows them to do things like remotely lock them, disable developer mode, and restrict login to only @school.edu email accounts.  There really isn't a way around these limitations from a technical standpoint (it's cloud based and tied to device serial numbers). They were designed to prevent thieves from being able to access confidential company data, and to turn stolen devices into bricks to deter theft in the first place. If you do manage to find a way to circumvent the restrictions, you may even be eligible for a reward from the security bug bounty program.  Your best bet, as always, is to work through the official channels inside your organization. Many schools are new to these devices and don't know all of the ins and outs yet. Some (friendly!) discussion can go a long way to having them adjust settings on their end.  Best of luck!"
chromeos,3dvbup,CraigTumblison,2,Sun Jul 19 22:12:09 2015 UTC,"If the Chromebook is school property, then you need to talk to them about what to do. Anything else will get you in trouble and possibly suspended.  It's possible you can get a policy exception by saying that you want to explore programming, buy I wouldn't hold your breath. They are protecting their network, and you'd better have a ton of trust all you and down the chain of command to move that needle."

chromeos,3dtm68,SchwuleSau,6,Sun Jul 19 09:43:10 2015 UTC,"Sorry, this was brought up as an issue and closed in 2014.  Issue 268046:Provide additional brightness control settings (a feature request)   Basically:   a) After you adjust the brightness, the power manager will leave it alone until you reboot.   b) A default level is used at boot rather than restoring the previous level. There's some discussion of (b) at issue 221089 . Restoring the previously-set level at boot was problematic, since there's no reason to believe that the system was previously used in an environment similar to the current one -- if I set the brightness to 100% because I'm using my device in a bright room, I don't want to be blinded the next time I boot it in a darkened room. We decided to always start with a middle-of-the-road default brightness level instead, which isn't perfect but is at least predictable.   I don't think that a setting to control the initial brightness level would have widespread use, and I don't think controlling this would be useful to enough extensions to justify exposing it via the chrome.power API either.

chromeos,3dtm68,WhatsUpBras,0,Sun Jul 19 21:09:47 2015 UTC,"Alot of Chromebook OS small details have been ignored   Google is a software company. They should easily be able to include a suite of offline programs like a photo editor, making docs offline permanently with the option to upload automatically to the cloud when you connect to WiFi. Little issues like not saving the brightness or setting time out for screens is a huge hassle for the user and such little work to expose the settints for the developer.   So because that douche thinks it's justified to start the brightness at a default setting is beyond moronic. Businesses will laugh and be legit frustrated if every time they open up their chromebook they have to adjust the brightness   Idk i just think that chromebook has tons of potential that Google isn't even willing to scratch the surface of.   Another huge issue is the build quality of these laptops. Google should say anything above 11.6 must be full HD and provide the proper scaling features found in all OS  Most new Chromebook are $200 and up. Tack another $50-75 and put in a nice screen. Make Chromebook by default have a better screen resolution than a cheap Windows laptop. But if your chromebook is 13-15 inches and sells for $250-300 there won't be that much immediate differentiators when purchasing. But if I go to the store and find out I can get a cheap windows laptop with a shit screen or a chromebook which is faster with a better screen then that gives me a solid reason to choose it.   Budget chromebooks are fine for schools but most consumer models should at minimum have 4gb of ram and an i3. If Amazon can sell the 2gb i3 for $200 then most of these manufacturers can and should up the  specs to provide a lag free experience which is the main reason someone would choose a chromebook over a cheap windows laptop in the first place, the ability to browse the Web without lag and slowdown."

In the case of my son, it turned out that even though there was one course that seemed to pre-req a specific Windows program, it turned out that it was only used for one project.  So, he has found that while he has both a Windows and ChromeOS system available to him, he uses his C720 Chromebook for virtually everything.    Even for that one Windows program, he generally kept the Win system in his dorm and used Remote Desktop to use the program.  What's happening on campuses is that teachers are finding that they cannot count on students to necessarily come in with Windows systems, especially as Apple has gained the lion's share of the personal computer market.   So, from my observation, it seems that it is much less common for Windows systems to be required as much as they used to.   At the very least, they'll give you the choice and in some places, even Chromebooks are among the choices, especially where the campuses have already bought into Google apps.

The trackpads on chromebooks are generally quite good (when you get one that works, but that is another story), and I actually quite like the size of them. I have had bad experiences with apple trackpads becoming sticky. I will say though that the force trackpad is a nice thing.   To address other points, many of the ultra portables are much more preferable in my book to Macbooks due to their useability, functionality with windows, and ease to repair and cost."

Any Windows laptops with the same specs as the MBA and similar thinness and weight would be nearly $1000 or more.  I know because i spent nearly $1k on two top of the line windows laptops that both had terrible trackpads.  Want an ultrabook with similar size/weight as the Air? Get ready to pay $800-1000 and deal with no magnetic charging port and a horrendous trackpad.

Let me explain to you how glorious Apple design is. The most recent macbook air 11"" throttles to half speed (and half benchmark ratings) unless you watercool the bloody thing. Check out the linus tech tips video. Secondly, on many of the Imac's, they also throttle, both cpu and gpu, along with having stupidly complex motherboards linked through ribbon cables. Finally, the nail in the coffin is the glossy screens on all the laptops, that while looking nice at first, quickly become heaps of fingerprints.

chromeos,3dqy2l,SonofaBitchVanOwen,5,Mon Jul 20 15:33:35 2015 UTC,"Particular requirements: if your intro course requires MSFT Office, then Windows PCs and Macs are necessary and Chromebooks won't work. If this course requires use of specific add-ins, Macs may be problematic. You may not have an instructor, but the department surely has a secretary, and s/he should be able to tell you what the minimum requirements are. Department secretaries know more than most students assume they do.  If this course would allow you to use LibreOffice, then you should be able to use rollApp from a Chromebook to work with LibreOffice.  If it's very basic 'productivity software' stuff in this course, online spreadsheet, wordprocessor and presentation apps might suffice, but they're all so much less than traditional varieties that it's unlikely they'd be OK.  In General: Depends on major. Any STEM department will require you to use higher-end calculation and mathematical software. Some schools provide network access to application servers running MatLab, CAD, Mathematica, SPICE, and other math, stats, emgineering software. If you're attending one of those, a Chromebook should suffice, but make sure there's a ChromeOS client for their particular infrastructure. So maybe for STEM.  For everything else, online wordprocessors and presentation software may be adequate. You'd be the best judge whether they handle footnotes and page layout adequately."

So my concerns might not be problematic for most students.  If you have to do some kind of constructing or create electrical networks those programs are usually only available for Windows and maybe Linux or OS X (most of them run with Wine though). So you'd have to install Linux on your Chromebook to make them work.  Economics could be problematic as well. I even had some problems with Excel spreadsheets when using LibreOffice. Not because Excel is better or has more features but because some options just aren't in the same place. And when your teacher shows you how to create some kind of graph and you have to research how to do it with your machine later it's quite annoying. I have also tried the Office web apps. They are really inferior to the Office package. This is also not limited to economics. Statistics is required in a lot of subjects (social sciences, psychology etc.).

If you feel restricted by ChromeOS, just Crouton the rest. Particularly if you are going with an i5, you should be able to get most work done on projects with Crouton.  I use a combination of a Zotac Zbox EN760 and a Toshiba Chromebook 2, though I was using an Acer C720 as my portable to get work done whilst I was at the university.  My single complaint is that the Chromebooks have paltry amounts of local storage, even as flash prices continue to drop (this can really be seen with 32GB SD cards). Using this in conjunction with ChromeOS would mean faster transfer rates and faster Crouton integration.   Also, if going with an SD card, the 32GB 60MB/s ones are the best for performance in Crouton and price. You'll also have a load of space knocking around as a result, with mine currently at roughly 27GB remaining.

I am guessing they are different operating systems).
chromeos,3dqy2l,Diggy-Dog,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:02:42 2015 UTC,"I'll give you a little info on what the basics are.    Linux is a bit of software called the ""kernel"". It runs between the hardware and the software of the device to keep it ticking over. Software, such as Google Chrome, has to be designed to work with Linux. It is also what makes Chrome OS secure, as the operating system has security features first-and-foremost. ChromeOS and Ubuntu run this kernel. Ubuntu is basically a bundle of software, which includes a modified version of the Linux kernel to take advantage of the Ubuntu Package system. Packages are basically programs or bits of software that can be installed or removed, similar to Chrome Apps or .exe files on Windows. Crouton is a script (like that of a soap opera or a play, but with code) that talks to the kernel, then installs Crouton, Ubuntu and some packages needed to run as well. This means that Ubuntu (which can install a wide variety of Linux applications that some people may want to run such as GIMP, Firefox or Inkscape) and ChromeOS (which does not support running these applications) side-by-side. There are benefits and detriments to doing this, namely being able to run a wide variety of software for the former and performance and enabling Developer Mode being the latter.   Hopefully, this gives you a brief overview. Here is a talk what Linux is, if you prefer that.   If you need any help, feel free to message me. :D"

Here's my advice.  You MAY have significant issues with your Chromebook, and here's why.     IF your school uses Respondus,  a ""lock down"" browser for secure testing, your Chromebook will not work, period. IF you take a computer class, requiring MS Office,  you MAY have issues with the teacher. Sure, you can use Office online or as another poster said, an older version of office, but a computer class is going to be teaching the newest version of Office. IF you end up doing research, you may find yourself hampered by Chrome OS. There are some great reference managers that integrate very nicely with MS Word.  And while, there are some reference managers that work in Chrome, (e.g. Mendeley), I do not think they integrate with Word.   I do not know of any solution for the lock down browser issue. However, you may be able to bypass the Office issues using remote desktop."

chromeos,3dqy2l,Graveyardigan,2,Tue Jul 21 18:08:06 2015 UTC,"So, from 2012-2014 I used only a Chromebook as my personal device for my undergrad. I did a semester of computational physics on it, multiple classical/quantum mechanics assignments in Sheets, and even for my research at CERN (via SSH) -- it was the best $200 I've ever spent. I did upgrade the RAM to 4GB, and had Chrubuntu, crouton, and Chrome OS all running at one point or another (Chrubuntu ended up being the best for memory addressing).   I used that little guy until it essentially burned out every component. Back in 2012 (if I remember correctly), Sheets wasn't as fully featured as Excel, so to get certain things to work I had to go into the lab and use Windows to get some random things to work. Now, it seems like Sheets has caught up and has virtually the same features as Excel.   After I retired the C710, I ended up getting another Acer (some white one with a weird model number) at Best Buy recently, and it's just as good.   TL;DR: if you want to spend less right now, go for the Chromebook. These things last and you get a lot done with them while spending a lot less."

If you just need to do software agnostic word processing, spreadsheeting, or use presentation software - Chromebook is a much better choice.  If you get the i5 Acer 15, your laptop will fly. for ~$500 you will have an amazing experience. Chromebooks are also officially supported for a minimum of 5 years, so your device will fly.   Some tips - ChromeOS is designed around the Google ecosystem - so embrace it! Use Google Drive (not Dropbox) and you will have better experiences.

chromeos,3ds5di,Totuum,3,Sat Jul 18 22:56:00 2015 UTC,"Hey there, excellent questions.  The exact limitations are completely up to your school. Here's a list of every policy that an organization has the ability to enforce:   http://www.chromium.org/administrators/policy-list-3   Generally speaking, most organizations (especially schools as opposed to businesses) don't enforce all of those policies. They could in theory, however.  Your school will be able to decide whether or not to allow personal accounts to log into the devices. Personally, I would highly suggest creating (or keeping) your personal Google account if you can, because after you graduate the school will have the ability to delete your school account. I've seen this happen in the past, and for students that make app purchases on their school account, it's a real pain to see all of that vanish during the summer after graduation.  Chromebooks don't have ""administrator access"" in the typical sense. All accounts on the device are the same, and the policies are controlled remotely via an online management console. This means that the IT department has the ability to change permissions and settings remotely, and your device will get those changes instantly. Some schools allow students in IT classes to work hands on with this tool and provide tech support to other students - if you're tech savvy, you may want to see if that's something your school is doing.  I'll let others tackle the general tips, but feel free to check out the sites in the sidebar for more information in the meantime :)"
chromeos,3ds5di,CraigTumblison,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:11:01 2015 UTC,"Wow, I really appreciate the detailed reply. Thank you. Are they able to enforce these policies even if I am on my own internet connection at home?"
chromeos,3ds5di,CraigTumblison,2,Sun Jul 19 01:22:28 2015 UTC,"You're welcome!  Yes, the policies apply regardless of which connection you're using.  Policies are actually applied in two different ways when properly managed. The first is a per-account set, and the second is a per-device set.  The per-account policies will follow your @school.edu account around, no matter which device you use. If you log into a personal computer with that account, you will be limited on that device too (only when using that account, however). This is another reason to keep a personal account for personal use.  The per-device policies follow just that device around. The big ones here are the ability to remotely lock a stolen device, for example, or limiting log in to only @school.edu accounts.  That's the perfect system, anyway. It's really hard to say how extensive your school will want to manage these devices. I've heard of schools that are very hands off, essentially allowing students to do whatever as long as the devices aren't damaged. Other schools take it even further and force-install apps that track other metrics, or provide URL filtering (for blocking websites - even while you're at home or at Starbucks).  I'm an advocate for more standardization in this area, and I would love it if schools were more transparent about which policies they use, and what they mean precisely to students. Unfortunately we haven't seen much progress in this area yet, but hopefully as more schools switch to using Chromebooks for 1:1 programs we will see a change."

It doesn't happen all the time tho - seems to happen more moving around delicately in forms but likely just anecdotal - so it seems more like the CPU/software is struggling and has to catch up, say with a bushel of events fired off, than the trackpad per se. But that too seems a bit odd what with Pixel specs, and there is no cpu/chugging noise as you might hear sometimes, and there will be lots of memory left according to memory monitor, so I'm slightly baffled but think software.  2) I can also get clicks firing off and things sticking and dragging, for example in gmail a label on the left menu will stick and drag along with the cursor when I didn't even try to do that. And happens repeatedly.  3) relatedly, and for the life of me, I can't figure out ""tap dragging"", so I'm not sure if not working right or I'm not working right :) First of all there is oddly no explanation of it at all in the help docs that I could find. I found, I think, only 1 post by a google employee who said to tap twice quickly, pause slightly, then drag. But never works for me on an object though I have managed it on a tab and when not wanting it in gmail as per above.  Is there any problem with ""tap dragging"" as there was around v39-40? Otherwise, can anyone tell me if ""tap dragging"" works on this example and, if so, how [i]exactly[/i] you are doing it? I can't. http://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_draganddrop.asp  Or how you would do tap dragging to drag a word of text on this page up to the url bar? That I cannot do except double tap to select, click and drag with 2nd finger.    If it helps, this is what crOS help told me:  Please follow the instructions below, testing to see if the issue is resolved after the applicable steps: 1 Make sure that the touchpad has no dirt or dust - both might affect touchpad performance. 2 Tap the touchpad (""drum roll"") with your index fingers over and over for 10 seconds. 3 Press Ctrl + Alt + right arrow. Then, press Ctrl + Alt + left arrow. 4 Check the touchpad speed and settings: ----Click the status area on the bottom right corner of the screen and select Settings. ----Scroll down to the Device section and adjust the touchpad speed. ----Click the Touchpad and mouse settings button and toggle tap-to-click and scroll methods off/on. 5 Perform a hard reset. If your issue still persists, please respond to this email to let me know.    (Arghhh...

chromeos,3dm49n,TheHopelessGamer,34,Fri Jul 17 11:26:23 2015 UTC,"This is an excellent question, as I've heard it quite a few times.  I think the endpoint answer of Windows vs. ChromeOS stems directly from the user's needs.    Your use case matches perfectly with ChromeOS up until the mention of Hearthstone.  Hearthstone could certainly be played on a Chromebook, given a Crouton/Chrubuntu installation with wine; but why go to that trouble if a Win laptop better suits your needs and will work for your intended purposes straight out of the box?  I'd say go with the Win device.  More lengthy discussion follows...  To me, the advantages of a Chromebook stem from it being a device that starts instantly, requires (nearly) zero maintenance, is very portable, has lower risk associated with loss/theft, can be handed off to someone else for use without risk of them ""fiddling"" with your setup/stuff, and is a direct line to Google's ecosystem.  Even with those of us who are geeky tinkerers need a go-to device that ""just works"", and Chromebooks fill that gap.    Windows can be a bit resource heavy, requires (in theory) additional security applications, installed programs and drivers have to be manually/separately updated/maintained, etc. Yet, it is a far more comprehensive and capable OS which can be used for  easy adb access to Android devices, LAN media serving, security cam monitoring/storage, photo editing, printing, etc.  Plus, the XboxOne's game streaming to Win10 is ridiculously awesome.   For me, I couldn't live without a Windows device; but it does gather dust more and more these days."

chromeos,3dm49n,wiredfire,5,Sat Jul 18 18:58:47 2015 UTC,"This is a good answer for this sub.    I will mention a couple things:     Windows 8/8.1 includes integrated antivirus software that is very effective. Every single one of my Windows machines uses Windows Defender (previously called Microsoft Security Essentials as a free download, still supported in Vista and 7), and I've never gotten a virus. Don't download random junk of the Internet and you'll be fine. Microsoft has gotten significantly better about providing driver updates through Windows Update. It's not always perfect, but it works pretty well. If you don't build your own machine, every OEM I know of now provides an updater utility that grabs the latest drivers from their own servers and installs them for you. That keeps things fairly simple in terms of staying updated on drivers.   To the OP: if you're looking to play games, stick with Windows. The Switch 10 is a pretty rad machine (I have one of the previous gen ones with a faster Atom than what's in the current gen), but the keyboard is around 90% full size. I have very small hands for an adult female and the keyboard is a little cramped even for me. If you have a chance to look at one at a store, try it out before you buy it, just to be sure - or use a separate Bluetooth keyboard if you need a bigger keyboard for gaming. Other than that, for the price, it's a great device and has a much better display than other 2-in-1s and tablets in the $100-$300 price range."

If you need it to play a game, I wouldn't necessarily recommend it, but I can guarantee that a $200 chromebook will definitely run faster than a $200 windows machine, simply because the OS for Chrome is just much lighter.

chromeos,3dm49n,creiij,6,Fri Jul 17 12:50:03 2015 UTC,"While Hearthstone might not be viable on a Chromebook, the advantages are low maintenance, increased security out of the box, not having to wait while your computer is stuck at update 24 out of 156, and one other thing.  Chrome OS is designed from the ground up to work well on minimal specs. You will get great performance, because Chrome OS is the equivalent of a precision device that does one thing well, which is web. Windows is kind a of a swiss army knife that does many things somewhat well. Unfortunately though, because of this Windows tends to need higher specs to accommodate for overhead. If you try to run Chrome on a Windows computer and on a Chromebook of similar specs, that Chromebook is going to run it much better 9 times out of 10 simply due to reduced overhead. Remember the days of Windows netbooks. Remember why they died off."

chromeos,3dm49n,Capo85,3,Sat Jul 18 10:49:21 2015 UTC,"The main problem I have with the current crop of low-end Windows devices is that 32 GB of space is simply not enough for these devices. This is most acutely an issue for any of the Atom-powered devices running 32-bit Windows 8.1 with Bing, as these have an 8-9 GB back-up partition that cannot be removed by the user, meaning you have barely any space open to work with on the device. At least on the HP Stream 11 you're using 64-bit Windows, meaning you can actually remove the partition or even change it easily to Ubuntu down the line.  On those Atom systems, even if you move the majority of your applications and data to an SD card, just Windows updates and the room the OS requires to run successfully will mean that for all intents and purposes you will hit a point where you have no room to work with on internal storage. If you're able to get one with 64 GB of storage, that will be a much better experience for you.  The other issue I have is with the 2 GB of RAM and the system impact of Win 8.1 compared to Chrome OS. Understanding I've become accustomed to Chrome OS, it is pretty crazy to see how slow an Atom 3735 or Celeron N2840 run Chrome on a Windows 8.1 laptop with 2 GB of RAM compared to a Rockchip RK3288 SoC running Chrome in Chrome OS. For me, trading the 99% of the time I'm on the web for a better experience was worth giving up 1% gaming time. For Hearthstone, which you can now play on tablets and smartphones, this should be something you definitely consider.  Hopefully in 2016 the default RAM on these lower end devices will jump to 4 GB, as I think this would really help them do the things Windows computers are supposed to have as advantages, such as multitasking and successfully running MS Office without lag."

chromeos,3dorjd,WhatsUpBras,3,Sat Jul 18 00:40:08 2015 UTC,"It depends on the load at the time. For example, my Acer Chromebook 13 would run 10-11 hours under normal use, but if I was really pushing it, the estimate might drop to 6 hours.  It would eventually go back up once the heavy load subsided.  Here's a demonstration: My wife's Acer CB3-111 with a few tabs open http://i.imgur.com/pTfYjeX.png My wife's Acer CB3-111 after a few minutes at 100% cpu load http://i.imgur.com/Ne8GLW7.png And the same machine after a few minutes with just a few tabs open again http://i.imgur.com/WQWzDyn.png"
chromeos,3dorjd,studbeefpile,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:53:19 2015 UTC,Wow thanks for taking the time to point this out. I'm really enjoying the Chromebook and that's coming from someone who has used a Macbook Air for the past 5.5 yrs. Hopefully my dad will enjoy it as much as I am. I know he is gonna hate the screen coming from a 15.6 windows laptop that's 4 inches lost.   I really was struggling back and forth bw the c720 and the chromebook 2 ultimately the $100 price difference and claims about screens failing and lagginess for the CB2 scared me away
chromeos,3dorjd,yusoffb01,2,Sat Jul 18 06:07:50 2015 UTC,"I bought CB2 because the screen is amazing. thought of getting acer cb15 but the keyboard didnt make sense.  Installed ubuntu unity on 64GB sd card on it and also steam, MS office, Dropbox and Evernote.  The ""slow"" cpu comments did concern me, but as long as you have a few tabs open, there is no noticeable slow down. This is as far as multi tasking go for me"

chromeos,3do2n6,yiazmaty,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:00:48 2015 UTC,"Solved! Needed to access the developer console by pressing Ctrl + Alt + ""F2"" (the F2 is actually a backspace on my chromebooks keyboad). Login using ""root"" as login and ""test0000"" as the password if you left the root password blank when enabling developer mode on the chromebook. You can also change the root password by using set-devpasswd. Then go back to the terminal (Ctrl + Alt + t) and run the crouton download.   Just wanted to post this in case others have the same problem. The answer was kind of kicking me in the face but the developer console part was confusing since there are no traditional function keys on my chromebook."

Using that I run chromeos and Ubuntu at the same time and can switch back and forth instantly with a keypress. There is a similar option for Arch but last time I checked it was fairly new.

You can test your bitrate using the below videos posted by /u/wanderjahr a year or so ago:  https://www.reddit.com/r/NetflixBestOf/comments/23m338/example_short_23976_2010_11m_test_your_netflix/cgyj6bx  By viewing one of these, you can be certain about the resolution you're seeing.  I've not used the TCB2, but if you confirm that Netflix is running at the full 3000kbps, it really shouldn't look grainy on a 1080p screen (it doesn't on my Pixel at least); so that info will let you know the problem is elsewhere.

chromeos,3dkdy9,leagueofkata,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:06:09 2015 UTC,Is the RAM upgradable ? Edit: on either the toshiba or hp mentioned.
chromeos,3dkdy9,dubbrooklyn,1 point,Fri Jul 17 06:00:05 2015 UTC,I believe they are both soldered but I am not 100% sure
chromeos,3dkdy9,leagueofkata,1 point,Fri Jul 17 06:10:16 2015 UTC,Thanks for the answer! It looks like the acer cb is the only expandable cb I've seen.
chromeos,3dk8zd,fazza0123,2,Thu Jul 16 23:08:30 2015 UTC,"This seems to be quite popular. Anker have a great reputation for quality products. In terms of compatibility, I'm not 100% sure. I'm hoping for your sake that it's like a Logitech mouse, where once it's set up on a Windows computer/laptop it works fine on a Chromebook. If not, Amazon's return policy should sort you out just fine.  If it doesn't work, I'd recommend anything Logitech. I know that they can be made to work with Chromebooks, as long as you have a Windows/Mac computer to initially pair it to the USB receiver."
chromeos,3dk8zd,DavidA122,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:21:55 2015 UTC,Thanks! I'm going to give it a try with the trackpad and see how I get on! Added it to my Amazon watch list though now so thank you!
chromeos,3dk8zd,DavidA122,2,Thu Jul 16 23:36:35 2015 UTC,"I love the touchpad gestures. If you start using them, you might never want to even think about a mouse. They're so useful and they've saved me a lot of time, while being quite intuitive as well!"
chromeos,3dk8zd,Reygle,2,Thu Jul 16 23:39:46 2015 UTC,"I think you'll be so surprised by the track pad and its wonderful gestures that you won't really want a mouse in a week or so, but if you really do want one, maybe one of Logitech's Bluetooth mice will work for you."
chromeos,3dk8zd,shanman3us,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:26:52 2015 UTC,I agree. but I have just purchase the Logitech M570 wireless trackball. What a great piece of equipment.  I really like it compared to a standard mouse. It may be a bit bigger to pack and store but it really is great for your wrist and versatility.
chromeos,3dkvbe,Xxrichixx,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:22:43 2015 UTC,"The HP Chromebook has one of the best Celeron processors for a Chromebook. Con would probably be the lower resolution (1366x768) and its weight.  The Acer has a newer Celeron processor, even faster than the HP Chromebook, but it's 15 inch, which will make it less portable than the other two. Screen is 1366x768 as well, according to BB.  The Toshiba CB has the best resolution, at 1080p, but also has the slowest processor out of the 3, running on a Bay Trail Celeron. It's light and portable though, but may stutter when performing intensive tasks such as having a YouTube video play in the background while you scroll Facebook (which is quite a heavy page). I have one and it performs well for the most part with lag here and there, though it doesn't bother me too much.  Overall, if you want a light Chromebook, then the Toshiba is your solution, as long as you understand that it may stutter under intensive tasks. Great screen though. If you want to save money, and can live with a 1366x768 screen, then the HP should perform very well. Quite a powerful processor too, which should give you a fairly buttery smooth experience."
chromeos,3dkvbe,SCVGoodT0GoSir,1 point,Fri Jul 17 08:40:11 2015 UTC,I'm leaning towards the Toshiba but I am concerned about the processor. The reason I wanted a Chromebook in the first place was to enjoy a largely lag free browsing experience which maybe it doesn't quite offer. Decisions.  Anyways thanks for info it will help me a lot!

chromeos,3dkhb3,shanman3us,1 point,Fri Jul 17 08:57:30 2015 UTC,"There are some ways to get certain models of printer/scanner to work with Chrome OS directly, but you should strongly consider simply getting one that is cloud compatible instead.  That way you can scan to and print from your Google Drive directly.    I did this for my non-technical baby-boomer parents recently when they needed to replace a virus-ridden Windows 7 desktop and old printer/scanner.  Now they have a ChromeBase and Canon PIXMA MX8xx wi-fi enabled cloud printer/scanner, and do everything on Google Drive.  I just logged in with their Google account directly through the printer once, and now they just navigate the printer menus to scan or print.    I mention all that to make the point that this is a user-friendly route to go, especially after initial setup (which itself was easy).  The alternatives are to port an Android app or use SANE, which for this use case at least is in its infancy."

I believe they use essentially the same Bay Trail processor, but the Toshiba definitely has the better display at 1080p IPS. That's the big difference for me and why the Toshiba has been so popular on this sub.  If the internals and size are basically a draw, why not get the one with the better screen?

As mentioned by /u/mexistential_gyro, I'd also advise the 4GB model.

chromeos,3dg8wf,fuzzypits,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:17:03 2015 UTC,"I very hesitantly bought a refurb'ed 1stGen HP Chromebook 14 directly from WalMart well over a year ago, since they were the only retailer selling the now-discontinued model with 4GB of RAM and the free-200MB-of-cellular-data-per-month from TMobile. I purchased for ~$250, which at the time was about $75-$100 cheaper than buying that model brand-new from WalMart.  My expectations were exceeded and then some -- while the HP CB 14 came in a plain HP box, everything inside (computer & power adapter) was ""wrapped up"" in standard packaging and protective stickers as if it were brand new. I did receive the 100GB Google Drive offer even with the refurb machine. Not the best of screens, obviously, but I do enjoy the extra screen real estate over the 11"" models.  The HP CB 14 has worked flawlessly and has been one of the most dependable computers we've ever owned. My only (very minor) nitpick about it is the ""snow white"" color, which does pick up dirt, but the exterior has that soft touch, grippy coating so no complaints about that. Since my son just upgraded to a MacBook Air for college, I have now inherited his old C270 CB, while my wife will use the HP CB 14 full-time...but the HP soldiers on very well. My personal experience is that the HP Chromebooks are somewhat ""sturdier"" than most other plastic CBs."

chromeos,3de1uu,WhatsAQazza,2,Wed Jul 15 15:22:49 2015 UTC,"For media consumption all three of those will pretty much run the same. For linux, the recommendation is an intel processor. Besides models with IPS displays, I am not sure how the screens compare to each other. I mostly see people either say they are fine with it, or that it sucks.  My original HP11 has an IPS display and exynos processor, one of the worst. It does not really hiccup as you suggest with netflix, youtube, etc. It may be a bit slow to launch things (basically not instantly), but once a movie or video starts loading, it just goes.  The two processors that apparently make things run amazingly snappy are the celeron xxxxU type and the i3 (or higher). So if screens are not a big deal for you, and you want to do coding with linux look for one of those. This page is good for comparison and is in the side bar."

As for the Intel chips I'm wondering just how much more power you get. Baytrail is really tempting to me as most of the time you get far superior battery life, at least with the Asus c300 which is one that I'm looking at.   Really what it comes down to now that I think about it a little more are these options: Asus c300 4gb, Acer 740 4gb, and Toshiba CB2 4gb.   Asus: Best battery life(11hr) by far compared to the others. My biggest problem is apparently the screen and sound quality are abysmal. The processor is also not as strong which could be possibly troublesome on linux.  Acer: The most powerful of the bunch with a decent battery life(9hr) to boot. Screen seems to be acceptable to most people, not sure of the sound quality though. My biggest turn offs for this device are the smaller screen at only 11.6' and the fact that it's not fan-less although I've heard the fan isn't noticeable. Both very small turn offs in the grand scheme of things.  Toshiba: The best screen and sound quality of all the lower priced chromebooks. The processor is also a Bay trail which leaves me questionable on linux. Biggest gripe is the sub par battery life(I've heard between 6-8hr) compared to the others.   So, with that being said does anyone have experience with these chromebooks and care to chime in?"
chromeos,3de1uu,nighserenity,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:41:46 2015 UTC,"Obviously your analysis is good discussion of tradeoffs, something we all deal with. And if you want all the good stuff, you have to pay more (i.e. get a Pixel 2).  I think you can toss out the Asus. 9 hours battery is still pretty great. To be honest, I haven't ever been spoiled with these awesome battery lives in laptops yet, the HP11 is the best I've ever had and that gets 3-4 if im lucky heh. So even 6 hours sounds great to me."

The link I posted was to an announced release date, and coincided with a lot of  ""Cloudbook"" branding which, in the run-up to the launch of Windows 10 this month, was relevant I thought.   I've played around with the previews of Windows 10 and feel that the have a platform which could scale very well to a Chrome-style ecosystem (as well as a Tablet OS), perhaps making the comparison a little closer to a Chrome device than were the netbooks and cheap under-performing laptops of Windows 7/8."

Once a decent 13 inch, i5 with touch, HD IPS and USB C comes out, this computer will go to my parents (they already love it).

chromeos,3ddpv7,Niaden,3,Wed Jul 15 13:47:43 2015 UTC,"Screen size.  Do you want a 11"" screen that makes for an extremely light and portable device or do you want some more screen real estate for a better browsing experience.  Personally I think 13"" is the sweet spot but this is definitely about personal preference. Screen quality.  This can really vary.  I have an old Samsung chromebook and while the screen is ""fine"" that angles on it are really finicky.  Looking at it just 10 degrees off center (both left/right and up/down) makes a huge difference in how the screen looks.  That being said, when I'm sitting down and using it I just get it at the right angle and never think about it again.  If you want to be showing your screen to other people regularly then this would be a much bigger deal. RAM.  If you're the kind of person who routinely has 20-30 tabs open in chrome then do not get the 2GB models.  Instead go for the 4GB. Speed.  Not a critical spec to consider IMO.  Even the slowest modern chromebook will browse web sites every bit as fast as a $1,000 macbook.  If you're planning to install Linux on your chromebook then you might care more. Local storage.  Almost completely irrelevant as far as I'm concerned.  These are cloud devices used for accessing information from the cloud.  I use a chromebook daily and I've never even thought about looking at my local storage. Build quality.  Read the reviews and see what people think.  Honestly, I've played with a bunch of different chromebooks in the $200 - $300 price range and they all seemed great.  I've never touched a chromebook that was just flat out ""bad"" (ie, crappy touchpad or bad keyboard). Battery life.  All chromebooks have good battery life but some are really exceptional.  7 hours is nice, but 13 hours is amazing.  You'll have to decide how important that is to you.   At the end of the day even the cheapest possible chromebook is still pretty damn good.  Just get a screen size you're comfortable with and go for it."
chromeos,3ddpv7,Thaaron,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:41:27 2015 UTC,Number 4 simply isn't true. You'll definitely notice some difference on websites that require more of the processor.

The Dell 11 and the Acer Chromebooks with the Tegra K1 processor also have great battery life and are quite popular in general.  Just a word on the remote desktop app, found here. To get it working, you need to set it up on both your Chromebook and your PC, and then you can access your PC whenever it is turned on. Performance is respectable, but it's not amazing, as it's quite reliant on your internet connection and the rendering power of your CB.

chromeos,3dc94u,jsober,2,Wed Jul 15 19:56:08 2015 UTC,"I was not aware of having the ability to control that. Thank you for mentioning it!  For anyone interested, you can designate a portion of your disk for swap by opening a shell (ctrl-alt-t) and entering the command, swap enable 2000 (for 2000 MB of swap space).  It is persistent between boots. You can later remove it with swap disable."

Just my opinion :)"

I can be working on it, watching videos and listening to audio consistently all night and then think ""shit I better check how much battery I have left"" and to have it say that I still have 75% is just incredible.  This is like after... 4/5 hours use. Seriously amazing.  ( I have my screen dimmed to about 40% as that's enough for me )  The only issue I have is the viewing angles. At times I feel like it needs to be on the most perfect angle in order to give me the correct image ( even when it is sitting directly in front of me ) however for the most part I don't notice it too much as I use it for really basic things. If writing papers, checking out the odd YouTube video and social media etc is what you are wanting to use it for. Then go with the ASUS.  If you need to have a screen which shows you ever inch of detail perfectly... go with the Toshiba.  If the ASUS had a better screen... it would be the best chromebook out there."

I was always stuck towards the end if the day. I know I can just bring my charger into college but there isn't a very good selection of desks in my college with plug sockets.

Chances are you won't need the extra power, but it can never hurt if the extra price isn't an issue for you. It's more likely that you would bottleneck from the RAM usage before the CPU starts holding back performance, so just have a think about how much you plan to do in Crouton and if it's an extensive amount with resource-intensive programs, the LS is the way to go. Otherwise, you can spend the money you save on other things like a portable external hard drive or a laptop bag, etc."

Those aside I love it. I can do all my normal needs: blogging, portfolio, social media, spotify, viber, whatsapp, torrenting etc. on this laptop. The laptop is also a hell of a lot lighter that the macbook & the battery is amazing - 15 hours yesterday!  I also similarly have a love for FM. It is available on linux so thats no problem. You just have to ensure you get a chromebook with an intel processor, not ARM. The one I have is ARM which means steam can't be installed on it. To run steam you'll have to create a linux environment with Crouton, and there are plenty of guides for that."

I've done two in the last year (sister & brother in law) and it gives a whole new life to an older machine.

After installing 8GB RAM and an SSD, it (IMHO) performs just as well as a lot of modern laptops (with the exception of 4K video decoding and the like).  You could perform a similar upgrade to your laptop for less than $250, and it would likely surpass your MacBook Pro's original performance; you'd also probably get a longer battery life (mine increased by a little over an hour after installing the SSD).    Keeping the MacBook Pro would also give you a larger storage capacity.  I certainly haven't done a thorough search, but most Chromebooks only seem to have 16GB or 32GB of disk space, which would get eaten up quickly after you install Ubuntu (recommended min. of 5GB) and FM (3GB, as per your screenshot).

I'm pretty sure it's an issue because I've got the i7 (which tend to run hotter), and I'm guessing the thermal paste wasn't applied very well when first assembled. If I could easily reapply the thermal paste I would, but I still keep it around for doing things (mostly iOS development).

But aliases at least take some typing work off your shoulders.  Add them to ~/.bashrc, for instance...  alias x='sudo startxfce4' alias xtab='sudo startxfce4 -X xiwi-tab' alias atom='sudo enter-chroot xiwi atom -f' alias vlc='sudo enter-chroot xiwi vlc -f' etc."

You can also declare functions that you can use to execute a list of commands on the command line using the function name, for example:   function my_function(){     command     command     command     etc... }   You would use the command my_function to execute the list of commands.  Tip: Before you can use the aliases or functions that you save to ~/.bashrc you need to run the source command once: source ~/.bashrc or open a new shell.  If you want more complicated scripts google a guide on bash scripting.   Hope this helps."

chromeos,3d57mu,zim1985,3,Tue Jul 14 17:06:40 2015 UTC,Multiple cores = better performance because that means there's essentially more power for the computer to utilize (more cores to offload things to to run more things in parallel).

So when I have 10, 20 running the background, they are sucking CPU and the music I'm playing (www.iheartradio.com, 20M song catalog and still free!) is likely going to stutter.

You are still running Linux underneath, and will definitely benefit from multiple cores. The trade off is battery life, generally, except in the case of low energy consumers like the tegra."
chromeos,3d57mu,jsober,1 point,Tue Jul 14 12:03:40 2015 UTC,"I really doubt there will ever be full-power quad-core Chromebooks, so comparing them based on their number of cores is nearly a moot point.   The only processor that can really be compared by its number of cores that I've seen was the N2930 Bay Trail used in some Lenovos. It's the quad-core sibling to the much more common N2830. It's negligibly faster than the dual-core N2830, but when comparing Chromebook performance, it's probably best to look at the series of the processor than the number of cores.   At this point in time, the hierarchy appears to be roughly Rockchip/Exynos<Bay Trail<Tegra<Celeron<i3<i5<i7. Note that all of those from the Celeron on up, are Dual Core.  TL;DR: While in theory, having more cores to divvy up tasks among them is nice, the number of cores is a poor indicator of overall performance given the breadth of different processor types with differences among them that go deeper than number than number of cores."
chromeos,3d57mu,genericbeing,2,Tue Jul 14 18:07:43 2015 UTC,"While it is absolutely true that a processor can't be rated by the number of cores alone, it is definitely a factor in performance. I went with a tegra system because, while the processor is slower for certain tasks, having the distribution of work across more cores is extremely helpful for browsing with multiple tabs.  I previously used a Toshiba CB2 (dual core Celeron, Bay Trail iirc) and replaced it with this for exactly that reason - it could not deal with the number of concurrent processes I needed just to keep my email and a few other important sites open for work (nothing highly graphical; things like trello, slack, gmail and/or inbox).  And there is definitely something to say for being able to get to idle faster, where power usage is much lower.  That said, yeah, it will be a long time (hopefully) before a Chromebook needs a desktop-quality quad core or better. But I think it's interesting that when I am using the system, I generally see 50%+ CPU usage on 3-4 cores. The main culprit that I have identified is the google drive agent running in the background which seems to keep an entire core to itself at all times.  One nice feature of the Tegra is the performance for things like HTML5/JS powered video and graphics. It uses quite a bit less CPU time than the TCB2 did for similar tasks."
chromeos,3d57mu,jsober,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:33:49 2015 UTC,"That's interesting. I had a C720 for a while before my current Samsung. I'm not really sure how the N2955 would compare while mutlitasking to the Exynos since the C720 was hobbled by 2 GB of ram. That said, I've mostly switched back to using my i7-3632QM Windows laptop for getting work done just because loading pages on the Samsung is frustratingly slow after working on a different computer."

chromeos,3d4m0k,baseballandfreedom,0,Mon Jul 13 15:16:50 2015 UTC,"Yes, that is true. There isn't an image ghosting on lcd because there is nothing to burn out (except for the backlights, but that would affect every color), but this isn't your average ghosting. This affected the entire screen, the corners are now brighter/show white, all colors are now more blue, and then there is the image ghosting. As I described in a previous post, the glitch was similar to someone playing with the ribbon connector on the motherboard, which I check and was still plugged in/snug, but that still doesn't explain the image ghosting. And believe me, it is noticeable in videos, so if it had been there previously. it would have been seen.  What I am trying to figure out is how these screens, especially a higher quality ips panel can get this kind of ghosting. None of my tv's and monitors have ghosting after years of displaying windows bars, and they are both cheap. Hell. even my tablet that I use a clock 24/7 doesn't have image ghosting from anything on the clock or the system menu for android, and that is a 40 dollar tablet."

With some look you'll now be looking at his Google login details amongst other things if you have his Google login details you should be able to sign into his chromebook. If not maybe you got the password of his spare email address see if there is a spare email address in his Google recovery thingy? That could be it.
