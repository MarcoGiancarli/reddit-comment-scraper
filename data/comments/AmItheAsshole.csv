My dog and myself have been attacked several times during walks in the last year forcing me to carry a big walking stick.  The last attack was by a older Chow who ended up with a broken muzzle.  The owner said in the 10 years she had the dog it never attacked anyone.  I could have killed that dog in my own defense.  But im not that mean...i love all dogs.  And dogs will be dogs.Police sided with me and she got a ticket.  I didn't pursue legal actions even though i could have.  Keep your dog on a fucking leash.  If you don't you can lose your dog and get your ass taken to court for being negligent.  Yes you are the asshole in this case.  Take care of your dog so it doesn't die and you don't lose money.

The other dog will just keep chasing, and any unleashed dog that's trying to attack another is a hell of a lot faster than a human dragging another dog on a leash.  The best you can hope for (for your dog's sake) is that you can pivot yourself in between him and the attacker (which is stupid, because that's how people get bit).  Or maybe you're really lucky and skillful and can grab the other dog by the collar, which is also no good, because you can still get bit, and you're dog is likely to come back for round 2 and ALSO need to be kept away by you, who only has so much armspan."

All the above disagreement has to do with the idea that a leash will be effective in protecting your dog if another off leash dog wants to attack him.  Pulling your dog away may work if you're lucky and/or if your dog is one of the aggressive ones, but something needs to stop the aggressor from pursuing to effectively end the danger.  A leash in the hands of the passive dog's owner is not enough."

You're fine as long as you can control your dog by command, (which means you can stop him by voice even when something really interesting is motivating him to go...this is rare).  She's completely wrong for saying your dog should be on a leash when hers did the attacking.  Hers was the problem.  If she were controlling her dog, then she'd be right to say yours should be on a leash only if you failed to get your dog out of her space once it was clear hers was aggressive.  Every time you walk your dog in public without a leash, unless you can control your dog by command, you are deciding that everyone who has a dog that needs to be leashed cannot take him out in public.  I think that's an asshole move.    I can't tell you how many times I've had to pull my dog-reactive shepherd back from biting a friendly dog who wouldn't stay the fuck out of our space only to have a stupid leashless owner stroll up from 20+ feet back saying ""Don't worry, he's friendly.""

Whatever Dee has told you, there are certain things she will not and has not ever shared. Female relationships, particularly between best friends, can run deep and can survive any measure of bad blood. I speak from experience.  The fact that her best friend is your ex means less than nothing. They were friends before you came along, and sorry to say it, most friends come and go, most guys come and go, and some people you will retain. Over the course of your life, friends will become couples, marry, and divorce, and you cannot and should not take sides or expect other people to take sides.   I have no idea why Dee blew you off to see her best friend, but for all you know, something had happened, and they sure as hell aren't going to share any bad experiences your ex may be having with you. Perhaps she was supporting her best friend, as she should. Maybe she made a bad judgement call.  If you wanted to end the friendship as a result of this incident, that's your prerogative. But to do it by behaving in such a cruel, childish manner was unnecessary, and only reflects poorly on you."
AmItheAsshole,3e06iq,missshrimptoast,-5,Mon Jul 20 23:23:47 2015 UTC,I'm fully certain they were just having a normal hangout there wasn't some tragic event that Dee needed to support my ex through. I agree I shouldn't of been as harsh but it stings having a person who used to be one of your best friends fuck you over on what was one of or the last time you'd ever see each other and we both agreed it was important. Also I feel liked based on your original response you will claim she wasn't fucking me over but we agreed to hangout she ignored me and ditched me that is fucking someone over.
AmItheAsshole,3e06iq,missshrimptoast,4,Mon Jul 20 23:41:29 2015 UTC,"I already stated that it's possible she was just being a jerk. My point was that a person treating you poorly doesn't justify acting the way you did.   It's a common (and extremely childish) reaction that many people have to being hurt or angered to become terrible people themselves. Nothing justifies a person being terrible because someone else is terrible to them. You feel better for a brief moment, at best, and make the situation so much worse. Moreover, it all but nullifies your point or opinion in the eyes of others. IE, my wife cheated on me, she's terrible, so I punched her in the face. Yeah, you were right, she was terrible, but you still can't punch her in the face.  I'm reminded of a quote Sophocle's Ajax, ""Vindictiveness should not so govern you as to make you trample on the right."""

However, when you guys have the break-up conversation, you should probably make it clear that you think you guys just don't get along that well as a couple, and you feel like you're growing apart. Also let her know you still want to be around for her as a friend if that's okay with her because you know she's dealing with some tough stuff, it just doesn't make sense for you to be her boyfriend anymore. And then follow up on being a good friend.  BTW, check out r/relationships -- they are made for these questions."

I've often been in lines where a guy is waiting and his wife &/or kids comes up to join him (or vice-versa). No one gets pissed off, even if it's a long line -- in fact, everyone is happy to let the people by so the family can be together.  Apart from that warm fuzzy feeling, I think the reason no one minds this is that the guy and his family are going to be ordering and paying together, and it's not going to take that much longer for them to order, even as a family.  What would take a lot longer is if they were ordering and paying individually like a group of friends usually does. And because friends pay separately, there's really no reason they have to be together in line. You cutting was really just about you getting to order ahead of other people, no other reason.  Like some other people said, since you're just one person, I wouldn't say it was a huge deal, but if there were only a couple of people ahead of you, it shouldn't have been a huge deal for you to not cut in line, either."
AmItheAsshole,3dvj1j,csonnich,4,Mon Jul 20 06:35:07 2015 UTC,"This guy is on to it. Cheers for actually explaining why he the asshole.   If it were a movie theater and it was as simple as saying ""Three tickets please"" instead of ""two tickets please"" I think it would be ok, as ordering three tickets take equal time as ordering two tickets. But with food, the people behind you have to wait longer. And thus the assholery.   They they were your friends you joined really plays no part. If I have to wait longer in line so someone else can wait for a shorter time, the relationship between the people in front of me is irrelevant.   If you wanna wait in line with people, you have to default to the last person's position. The friends fall back to join you."
AmItheAsshole,3dvj1j,pooroldedgar,15,Mon Jul 20 06:52:45 2015 UTC,"Oh man, relevant as this just happened to me today.  I was in line at Wendy's. It's already a long line...maybe 15 or so people. There's a couple of guys near the front wearing bright orange construction vests. Just as they get to the counter... maybe a dozen more guys in construction vests come in, look at the line (eyes go wide with the realization that yes, there's a fucking long line) before the guys in front wave them over and say ""Just order with me.""  Boom. 15 people ahead of me just turned into damn near thirty because they were ""with their friends.""  Your situation is understandably different if it was just you, probably not a big deal. But still, you cut the line, you're an asshole. At least if it was without asking the folks behind you if it was okay."
AmItheAsshole,3dvj1j,ImNoHero,3,Sun Jul 19 22:18:08 2015 UTC,"No, you're not an asshole. It's not the most considerate, but it's one person at a bagel place talking to his friends, not the 15 construction workers someone mentions below.  I'm sure this will make this comment super popular, but it seems like the other commenters in this thread as the assholes. Dude, it's one guy who wants to talk to his friends, not the last loaf of bread in a bread line. You need to calm the fuck down."

AmItheAsshole,3dwayt,zjbird,2,Mon Jul 20 02:58:28 2015 UTC,"Not an asshole, but I think it's fair for him to only pay you what he currently owes you and then pay you for the job after it's done.

AmItheAsshole,3dwayt,Diarygirl,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:31:14 2015 UTC,"It's hard to say without knowing if you're an employee, independent contractor, or are working under the table.

Not the asshole here.  But you might want to tell your boss that you were busy and couldn't respond to his requests at the time and tell him that you can't cover for him every week.

If he really has a frequent history of just flaking on his own job, and dumping that on you, and he's never rewarded you for all the extra effort you put in, you have every right to be fed up.    However, I should note that you will become the asshole if you don't have a talk with your boss. You've go to explain to him that you're not just waiting at home hoping for more hours. Tell him that you had to cancel things and have people give you ride--or whatever--rearrange their schedules to make work happen when he couldn't come in.  You should tell him that making yourself available for all these late notice ""cover me"" sessions, means you deserve some kind of recognition more than just paid hours as agreed. You go above and beyond, and if that doesn't earn you a standard raise, then it's not worth it to you."

I think most people have been on one side or another of this scenario, often both. It's not restricted to improv.  If you've got the right personality, those games are hilarious and will spawn a bunch of new in-jokes and stories, bringing the group closer together. You come away feeling like you've discovered the secret formula to having a good time and you want to share it with all your other friends and can't tell why it isn't working this time.  If you're not that type, you can't understand why a friend would ask you to publicly humiliate yourself in the name of having a good time.  See also: team sports and karaoke."
AmItheAsshole,3dtg1x,ceelo_purple,3,Sun Jul 19 10:00:54 2015 UTC,"You're completely right. Just to add though: there are almost no ""generic"" activities that big groups can do that are likely to please everyone. Even something as generic as eating at a restaurant or going to a pub/bar can be unpleasant to some people, particularly if it's a kind of food they don't like or if they don't drink.   Bowling maybe? No, I know several people who hate bowling. Cinema? Depends on the film, and depends on how many people are in the group: too many people and it's not going to work.   No one's the asshole in these situations... Just differences in interests and temperament."

AmItheAsshole,3dtg1x,KarlaQat,3,Tue Jul 21 02:52:17 2015 UTC,"When you've hung out with them before, did you try to act enthusiastic about the improv, or did they already know it wasn't your thing? I'm just curious whether Mike had any idea that other people might not think improv was crazy fun.  It's really not that important, though. Either way, maybe you were doing some extra complaining at the party you left out? Because it's hard to see how from what you wrote here that you could be construed as the asshole. Improv's not your thing, but like a good guy, you played along anyway. It's hard to fake having a good time when you're really not and no one else is either. I don't think anyone can blame you for that, as long as you weren't doing a lot of bitching, and you at least tried to put on your game face.  And it's not really even Mike's fault that no one but he and Frank like improv, it just kind of sucks that he chose something for his birthday that no one else could really get into. Maybe if you don't really like it, you could have let him in on that earlier, and he might not have chosen so disastrously for his birthday. But I still don't think it makes you an asshole. Hopefully Mike's learned a life lesson from that.  I have to call no assholes here. Unless, like I said, you left something out."

AmItheAsshole,3dqvio,Crazy_Potatos,16,Sat Jul 18 16:09:20 2015 UTC,"Yes and no. It's part of your job and you should do it if it is required of you whether you like it or not. On the other hand, this new guy does not seemed to have been properly trained, which is on your boss. I could see him not being allowed to close it alone. Just because he didn't get it perfect the first time doesn't mean he should never learn.  That said, you shouldn't expect the new guy to do all the grunt work. He should do his fair share like everyone one, but he isn't your personal assistant. You should be doing the work you have always done."
AmItheAsshole,3dqvio,Viperbunny,9,Sat Jul 18 16:29:15 2015 UTC,"Your boss probably saw this as you not wanting to do the job, and preferring it to be done wrong than do it yourself.  So in that light you'd be an asshole.   Your side of it is just that the new guy needs to be trained more so he can pull his own weight. Which is reasonable and in that like you are not an asshole.   I think your edit is taking the right approach.  Stepping up and taking responsibility for the situation will likely be viewed positively, and nobody will be the asshole.  Maybe say that you'll walk him through cleaning up the back for a few weeks and then have him do it himself one night, at which point the boss can review his performance?"

AmItheAsshole,3dqvio,nagatake,0,Sun Jul 19 03:45:28 2015 UTC,"I think your boss might've reacted the way he did when you started out ""Well, that's not fair!"" because it makes it sound like you're going to whine if you don't get treated exactly like everyone else instead of just stepping up and doing whatever is needed at the time.  Regarding the plan in your edit, I think it's a good idea, but you're going to have to handle it carefully to not make yourself out to be the whiny, lazy guy again. If it were me, I'd probably say something like, ""If it's okay with you, I'd like to have NewGuy go through closing the meat case with me tonight, step-by-step, so he can see how it's done. After that, if you're on board with it, I'd like him to do it with me for a while so he can really get a grasp on all the details. Then, I'd like to supervise him doing it for a while. That way, in the end, everyone will be proficient at it in case one of us can't do it sometime...because it really doesn't make sense to have him working here but not knowing how to do this.""  edit: To be really clear, I think it's important you don't just go up to your boss and say ""I'm going to do this"" -- present your plan as an ""If it's okay, I'd like to....because..."""
AmItheAsshole,3dnfy9,S4int_Adri4n,23,Fri Jul 17 18:17:46 2015 UTC,"If you think that there is absolutely no way that the OP could have any doubt and either wants to brag or wants to troll people with something obviously horrible he did, hit the report button and write ""Shit Post"" in the ""other"" field.  The mods will review it, and if we agree, we'll mark it as such.     But, to answer your question, no, being suspicious doesn't make you an asshole.  However, you have to leave a little room for the idea that even someone who's easily in the right can wonder if they were totally right when what they did seems to have pissed someone else off.  ""Just making sure"" is a valid reason to ask, as long as the doubt is conceivably reasonable.  (Example, there was an earlier post today about an argument between two people with different opinions on homeless people, and I was fully intending to mark it a shitpost until I got 2/3 of the way through it and an actual argument broke out.  Until then, it seemed obvious that OP would turn out to be the sensitive one, just posting to humble brag about trying to make his/her friend more tolerant.  But, at the end, both are pissed at each other, and both could conceivably think the other one did something wrong, so either of them could legitimately have posted that story.)"

AmItheAsshole,3dmaj4,Cosmologicon,7,Fri Jul 17 12:42:10 2015 UTC,It's a good way to get punched depending on who you are videoing.
AmItheAsshole,3dmaj4,RevRaven,13,Fri Jul 17 16:18:52 2015 UTC,"I don't know, man, I think it's kind of a lousy way to address the problem.  You say you're against public shaming and wouldn't post a video, but the person you're pointing the phone at would think the exact opposite.  And there's a safety concern, I mean, if someone's a d-bag enough to do those things, then they're probably not above starting some shit with someone they believe is recording them.  And yeah, it is passive aggressive.  It's a one sided gesture that doesn't leave any room for discussion.  But, on the other hand, all the things you listed are asshole things to do, and they do them on a regular basis because they think nobody cares, or because they can get away with it.  Maybe passive aggressive isn't the worst choice.  I'm just not sure your action is going to change anyone's behavior.  Are you an asshole? Nah, I don't think so.  But if you try to be a social vigilante, it's going to be a hell of a hard road."
AmItheAsshole,3dmaj4,Funkingthefake,11,Fri Jul 17 14:04:34 2015 UTC,"Here's why I think this isn't so bad.  When I was a kid and first got my license, I drove like an idiot.  No signals at lane changes, trying to get my shitbox up to 100 on empty highways at night, running red lights if I thought it was safe, etc.  One day, I'm driving downtown and I cut off an old man walking across a crosswalk so I could blow by.  He was coming from the far side, and I was sure I could blow through without even requiring him to slow down...but it was close, and definitely illegal.  As I go by, he yells ""He-e-e-ey!"" and shakes his fist at me.  In my rear view mirror, I saw him take what looked like a notepad out of his pocket.  (Thinking he was going to write down my license number and call the police, I pulled over.)  It turns out he wasn't going to write anything down, but I told him I realized I was wrong and apologized.  I never heard from the police.  That incident was the first real experience that reminded me to think about people outside my car when driving (beyond considering them only as obstacles to be avoided), and I never cut anyone off like that again.     Sometimes, it can make a huge difference to remind a rude idiot that he's not the only person in the world and there could be consequences for failing to consider others.  This way seems to be an effective way to do that without crossing any legal lines, and not openly instigating a fight.  There's no guaranty that OP won't eventually catch a beating, but he could also do some good."
AmItheAsshole,3dmaj4,flignir,5,Fri Jul 17 15:04:59 2015 UTC,"I see your point, and once again it's a good reminder all around that there's a difference between doing asshole things and being an asshole.  And, yeah, maybe OP catches people at a bad moment sometimes, and they slipped up, and need a reminder that they're not the only person in the world. I would bet that's a minority, but it's important.  I suppose the thing that I have the problem with is the abject judgement of it.  When OP points their camera at someone who's not operating within their definition of societal standards, what they are saying is, "" I disapprove.  I am pointing my phone of judgement at you, and I am showering five megapixels of justice over you."" There's kind of an absolutism to it, as apposed to talking to someone, which is much harder more scary.  The fake recording sends a message of, ""You are wrong and the world must know,"" and I'm not inclined to think that's the best way to handle things."

AmItheAsshole,3dmaj4,beccafool,6,Fri Jul 17 21:59:58 2015 UTC,"I'm someone who is addicted to cigarettes and who has been tending to a loved one who is stuck in a hospital. Anyone who has had to visit someone having surgery knows that you're often stuck in a cold room for hours and hours while plagued with stress, which kind of encourages a smoker to smoke.  If there is a sign that says ""no smoking,"" I definitely wouldn't smoke there, but I'd probably walk around the building to find another unrestricted spot where the building offers shade, and if that happens to be in front of the hospital, the irony wouldn't stop me.   If I caught some dude filming me, I would think it was because he was a creep zooming into my boobs or something. The thought would never cross my mind that I was being shamed.   In my course of looking at nursing homes for the loved one I just mentioned, each and every one has a smoking section for the residents. Sometimes it's in front of the nursing homes. Now I don't smoke at the nursing homes, but I'm just mentioning that it's not against protocol."
AmItheAsshole,3dmaj4,megagram,2,Fri Jul 17 16:46:59 2015 UTC,"Sure I'll keep that in mind, thanks.

AmItheAsshole,3dmaj4,megagram,9,Fri Jul 17 22:01:56 2015 UTC,"take out my phone and point it at them, and pretend like I'm trying to get their identity on video  I think that public shaming is wrong   Think about this... You are essentially doing what you think is wrong.  I heard once that the best way to do this is to go talk to the person politely and bring it up not as an accusation of doing something wrong but as a courtesy explaining that they may not be aware of the rules and the potential fines they might receive.  So for instance, if you see someone smoking in front of the hospital you could go up to them and just say ""Excuse me, were you aware that smoking is not allowed here? I just wanted to let you know as you might get a fine. If you smoke just a few feet down the road there, you'll be good"""
AmItheAsshole,3dmaj4,megagram,-3,Fri Jul 17 15:57:50 2015 UTC,"Think about this... You are essentially doing what you think is wrong.   Hmm, I'm thinking about it, and I don't really see it that way.  Like, I don't think that pretending you're going to kill someone is ""essentially"" killing them. Of course it's also wrong for other reasons, but it's not the same thing."
AmItheAsshole,3dmaj4,NatanGold,6,Fri Jul 17 16:07:41 2015 UTC,"Well yes, exactly, killing someone is wrong. Going after someone with a gun pointed to their head is also wrong because they do not know if you're actually going to pull the trigger.  From your perspective, you know you're not pulling the trigger, or actually recording.  From their perspective they don't know if you're going to pull the trigger, or if you're actually recording."
AmItheAsshole,3dmaj4,i_sigh_less,-3,Fri Jul 17 16:16:34 2015 UTC,"Sure, and if I was doing it for no reason whatsoever, that would obviously just be a jerk move. But what if I saw someone, I don't know, torturing an animal? Killing him in that case would still be wrong, but it might be justified for me to run after him with an unloaded gun to get him to stop.  Certainly if I told you I did that, you could well say ""I don't know, I still think it was wrong to make him think he was in danger."" I think that's a perfectly valid opinion.  But I don't think you can say ""Think about it. You essentially killed him."" I just don't feel that's true."
AmItheAsshole,3dmaj4,patriotminerva,4,Fri Jul 17 16:22:58 2015 UTC,Well the killing analogy kind of fails at that point as when you're done threatening their life with a gun they can be sure you aren't going to kill them and the threat is over. Although they'll still think you're a gun-wielding psycho.  When you put the phone back in your pocket they have no idea if you recorded them and if you did what you're going to do with it.

AmItheAsshole,3dkj98,polesloth,20,Fri Jul 17 00:35:50 2015 UTC,"Full disclosure: I work in a homeless shelter and volunteer at homeless prevention, and i did that stuff 18 hours today, so if you want to completely disregard my comments as biased, that's a-ok, and I completely understand.    Part of my job is to accept people who make comments like Sam did without judgement, and give them an opportunity to present another perspective.  Another part is taking people like Taylor and restraining them from alienating those who could possibly offer support. It's nuanced.  It would be easy to judge Sam's comments because he says some insensitive and factually incorrect things, and presents a worldview which absolves society of responsibility for the homeless, but his personal knowledge base is laced with fear and disgust, and more often than not, those are things that come from fear.  Taylor has every right to be upset by insensitive comments.  He tried to present his view about something he felt passionate about, and I don't think Sam is aware even now how important an issue that is.  I think Taylor missed one turning point.  When Sam said he wasn't opposed to volunteering at a shelter, then it was a good time to shift the conversation from which perspective was right, because Sam was amenable to broadening his perspective.  Who's the asshole?  In social services we don't use net-negative words like that.  We say bullshit like this: both of you missed an opportunity for growth and dialogue.   Now if you'll excuse me, I'm going to drink scotch out of a bowl until I pass out.

She even acknowledged that her emotions were at least partially her responsibility and something she would ""probably get over"" once she had time to cool off.  Rather than being concerned he offended Taylor or respecting her desire for time to work through her personal feelings and back off as she politely requested, Sam jumps on the defensive, keeps hounding her, and actually tries to TURN IT AROUND on her.  Which of course, only further confirms Sam's lack of empathy...  Also how on earth was saying you're disgusted by homeless people a joke?  Yikes.

He's follow-up is much more measured and he was interested in going to a shelter which could have provided valuable life experience.   Taylor was too caught up in his own shit to take advantage of this opening and wasted an opportunity to grow and help someone else grow. That moment is gone now.

Taylor was the asshole for how the conversation was handled and especially the escalation of the second part. If you are Taylor, then you either wanted to have it out with Sam or to avoid the subject and cool off. Actually telling Sam that you're angry and need to cool off before you discuss this is a 100% guaranteed way to immediately re-ignite the argument, while still trying to claim the moral high ground.

Don't feel guilty for not finding someone attractive, its the way of the world, you did an honourable thing in giving her time.  So you aren't the asshole, unless you told her you weren't interested in front of other people, even worse if it was her friends, that would have been really embarrasing for her, even if she was bitchy/wasn't a nice person, if thats what you did then I'm sorry but you are for sure an asshole"

You said no and they're still pushing you, that's sexual harassment and you are under no obligation to be polite, tell them to get stuffed.

AmItheAsshole,3didbo,ritsikas,3,Thu Jul 16 19:03:57 2015 UTC,"That's what I thought.  A free lyft ride is worth $20 a pop and they don't expire instantly.  You can choose when to use it, so even though it's ""free"" it's definitely worth some non-zero amount of money to you.  Since that's true, it can also be true that accepting compensation for it, even though you didn't spend any cash RIGHT THEN, is totally fair."

AmItheAsshole,3didbo,Abelithea,24,Fri Jul 17 10:23:51 2015 UTC,Well it is low as hell to accept it but in the end you gave her something that amounts to a gift and you can't really take those things back. Sorry dude.

AmItheAsshole,3didbo,Abelithea,2,Fri Jul 17 10:21:31 2015 UTC,"I'm not so sure.  A free lyft ride usually has a precise dollar amount attached to it, i.e. $20 or less.  If she hadn't used the free ride with them, she'd have used it some other time.  In either case she saves herself (up to) $20.  If you assume she would have taken a lyft whether it was free or not, and you assume she was going to use all of her free rides, (both very reasonable assumptions) then the lyft ride did effectively cost her money, even though it was ""Free"".   Say you go to a bar and 1st drink is free.  Everyone there intends to have several drinks.  You buy a round of 5 drinks but only pay for 4. The guy getting the free one says he shouldn't have to pay you anything, while everyone else does pay you.  This is clearly not right.  Common sense dictates everyone pays the same, i.e. 4/5 of the cost of one drink.   So just because something is ""free"" doesn't mean it's wrong to accept compensation for it."

Now, if you were obnoxiously complaining about it to the friend who took the money and demanded to get it back, that might be a different story.  As for the friend who accepted the money, it sounds like a pretty crappy thing to do, to me. I don't like to accept people's money when it makes sense for me to take it, I can't imagine accepting it in a situation like this."
AmItheAsshole,3didbo,RickyBuck,6,Thu Jul 16 17:30:03 2015 UTC,"Does she know the money youre givimg her was for Lyft? If so, She's the asshole.

If she knew she was taking money for something that was free, that is just pure dishonesty.   OP is trying to be nice, but simply forgot about the situation at hand. Now it's awkward to ask for the money back because she is in a tough spot and he feels bad asking for it.   I guess it's not right to judge because she is desperate, but if she is desperate enough to throw away her morals, she is the asshole, not OP."
AmItheAsshole,3didbo,Funkingthefake,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:57:03 2015 UTC,"IMO it's ""free"" but it's not really free.  You can use that lyft ride at any time, they are worth UP TO $20.  But say they only used $10 for one ride.  That means she gave up $10 worth of potential lyft usage in the future to get her friends somewhere.  Another way of saying that is that the ride cost her $10.  This isn't just semantics, lyft rides are worth actual money.  If you assume she was going to use them either way, but chose to use them with her friends, then it's fair to say the ride did cost her money, just not right then.  So it's also fair to accept some fraction of the cost in cash."

AmItheAsshole,3didbo,Funkingthefake,3,Mon Jul 20 04:02:40 2015 UTC,"Do you know what stealing is? Because when someone hands you money,  that's not stealing.    Look at it from her point of view. She lost her job and is probably scrounging for cash.  I'm sure she doesn't feel awesome about being a mooch.  When you handed her money, she probably thought you were smart enough to remember the words that she said, and the cash was a sly way of helping out someone in need without her losing pride.    Saying someone is a thief because you gave them something is stupid, and while she might be inconsiderate, you're the asshole."
AmItheAsshole,3didbo,TheEdgeOfTheInternet,3,Thu Jul 16 15:11:12 2015 UTC,"Do you know what stealing is? Because stealing exists in many forms including situations where you hand someone money. Ever heard of a con man? I'm not saying the friend conned OP out of money intentionally, but OP indeed gave her compensation for something she maybe shouldn't have been compensated for. Does this automatically make that friend an asshole? No. Maybe she didn't necessarily know what the money was for and thought it was a gift, but in the event she knowingly took the money and kept it under the guise of reimbursment for a Lyft ride that she didn't pay for then yea, she's absolutely an asshole.  I can't think of any scenario where one of my friends would hand me money out of the blue and I wouldn't ask them ""What's this for?"" unless I knew they owed me money.  By all indications, OP is a stand-up guy who made a mistake and not an asshole."

If she knowingly took money that she didn't deserve under false pretenses then yes she stole it. As I said she may have not realized what she was doing and you can't fault her for that, but I find it hard to believe she didn't know what she was doing.  Fraud is a form of theft.

I'm not saying it's a degree of fraud that anyone in their right mind would take legal action against, but it would still be fraud."
AmItheAsshole,3didbo,the-incredible-ape,2,Thu Jul 16 17:36:43 2015 UTC,"But it was after the fact and she clearly stated she had the free passes.  Let me ask you something.  Do you know why people catch cabs in Seattle, and why people forget simple important details, and why people are happy to take money for no reason, and why people give money and get pissed about it later?  Booze.  These people went out for drinks, and now we're sorting out their stupid tipsy escapades.  I would bet money OP had tied one on when he gave this person the cash, and she wasn't sober when she took it.  No more internet for me today."

AmItheAsshole,3didbo,nicocappa,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:00:31 2015 UTC,"I see what you're trying to say...but let me explain.   Neither of us were drunk either time. She doesn't drink and I was going to work the first time. The second time was in the middle of the day...too early for me. But I absolutely understand why you would think that.   She was complaining about having to walk 4 blocks east to catch a bus. So she offered the Lyft ride.  I just completely forgot that she had the free rides, and out of habit (if thats the right word? A customary action after you share a cab/lyft with someone) I handed her money both times.   Even my GF forgot. After the second ride I handed her money and my GF said something to her like ""I'm gonna call it even since I bought pizza last night."""
AmItheAsshole,3didbo,Funkingthefake,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:57:42 2015 UTC,"It's not false pretenses at all.  She spent something (a coupon) to get the group somewhere.  The coupon, while ""free"" is worth $20 and can be used at any time.  So it's not right to say it has no cash value.  Using it then and not saving it for later, she saved her friends time and cost herself actual cash in the future.  So while they shouldn't bear the full cost of the ride or anywhere near it, it's not right to say she accepted money for something she knew was of no value.  Free ride coupons have a very definite cash value and she spent one on them.    If your work gives you tickets to an MLB game, does that mean you're a THIEF if you turn around and sell them to your friends?  Because that's basically what you're asserting here."
AmItheAsshole,3didbo,nicocappa,0,Fri Jul 17 16:24:30 2015 UTC,"So it's not right to say it has no cash value.   I stand corrected from when said   Maybe she didn't necessarily know what the money was for and thought it was a gift, but in the event she knowingly took the money and kept it under the guise of reimbursment for a Lyft ride that she didn't pay for then yea, she's absolutely an asshole.   I agree that the coupon has cash value. I still hold my position that if the friend was aware of the situation as it's been described by OP then she's an asshole.   Using it then and not saving it for later, she saved her friends time and cost herself actual cash in the future.   Consider this: I show up to a friends house with a pizza and my friend wasn't expecting pizza. Is it fair for me to expect money for this pizza if my friend doesn't want any?  Yea, she saved her friends time at the cost of her not having this coupon available to her at a later date, but it was saved time her friends didn't ask for and it came at the cost of actual cash to them right now.   If your work gives you tickets to an MLB game, does that mean you're a THIEF if you turn around and sell them to your friends? Because that's basically what you're asserting here.   I don't see how this is remotely the same or how I asserted that you would be a thief in this scenario. Selling tickets to a friend would imply we had a mutually agreed upon price that friend would give me for a ticket. If I made it all the way to the stadium with my friend thinking their ticket was of no cost to them and then suddenly expected money for it, I'm an asshole. https://youtu.be/0PKtGnyGuKM?t=128  Had the friend said something like ""Hey I have this Lyft coupon worth $20. Wanna buy it for $10?"" that would be totally cool. Instead, OP made a mistake and the friend was able to capitalize on it. My whole arguement hinges on whether or not the friend took the money thinking nothing of it or if the friend received the money and secretly thought they got away with something. Let me also say any opinions I've expressed thus far have been with complete disregard to the fact that OP and GF were providing a place to stay as well as covering some expenses for the friend as I feel they aren't relative to the point I've tried to make. However, taking that fact into account, I wouldn't judge her a thief based on that, but I would say it's a dick move to not offer to  contribute your Lyft coupon as a common courtesy as a way of saying thank you.  This came out way longer than I planned. Sorry if it sounds preachy. Just my opinion which isn't really worth shit anyway."

Makes sense.  My view of it is a 3rd option, in which (maybe) the friend assumed that the money was given in recognizance of the fact that while 'free', the lyft coupon was worth money, and that fact was understood.  If that's so, then she was not an asshole for accepting the money."
AmItheAsshole,3didbo,nicocappa,2,Fri Jul 17 19:54:43 2015 UTC,"I can accept that as a valid theory and say that it's probably more likely than my idea that the friend just casually accepted money without thinking anything of it.

Perhaps just next time your smoking or vaping or however it works you could just say 'hey man, I'd appreciate it if you'd ask before borrowing the vape, it's a bit expensive'"

I totally understand that people don't like when other people use their things without permission, especially expensive stuff... but he probably thought it was ok because you offered to share it with him the previous day...     I would just put it somewhere where it's not out in the open. after that, if they use it again, I'd be pissed."

It's how to act that define if you are or not, and so far you have done nothing. If you started sulking with him and behaving a little differently - yes. If you cussed him out and had a go at him - yes. If you bitch about him behind his back to your other roommates and friends - yes. If you politely let him know you'd appreciate him asking for permission first - no. If you decide it isn't worth it and let it go - no. If you hide it somewhere he can't find it, thus solving all problems without confrontation - no."

Explain the situation and that it was incredibly unprofessional and racist. I would also talk to your boss. Tell him that this is bothering you and that things are going too far. Tell him what he did bothered you and you would appreciate it if he would cut it out, or at least tone it back. If he gives you a hard time then you will have to decide what your next step is.

AmItheAsshole,3dfibx,Funkingthefake,9,Thu Jul 16 02:47:39 2015 UTC,"Your boss is the asshole.  A running joke you share is one thing.  When you have a good working relationship or friendship, off-color banter is part of the game.  If both of you are cool with it, there's no problem.  But when a third party enters, the rules change.  It's not a funny joke, and it's a green light for others to air their dumb racist comments.  The electrician might have been a total dumbfuck racist bigot shitbag (which your boss probably knew), but he doesn't say shit about every Asian he comes across.  He said it because your boss started it, cause he's an asshole."
AmItheAsshole,3dfibx,Invalidword,2,Thu Jul 16 03:26:08 2015 UTC,"I Suspect the electrician just felt he was left out of the banter, being you're bosses friend and all. He walks in sees you and you're boss joking around and feels jealous so he joins in; it does make him any less of an asshole."
AmItheAsshole,3dfibx,Lamenardo,2,Thu Jul 16 03:06:47 2015 UTC,"No, he should realize banter like that only works between friends. It doesn't matter even if he is mates with your boss, he doesn't know you. Other than mentioning it to your boss, perhaps you could just go 'oh man, that went a little far, not cool' next time he drops one of those. I mean, there's racial jokes and there's racial jokes, and his sound a little more offensive, although I don't know how you and your boss joke around together. Also, he isn't referring to you directly, he's addressing your boss as if he owned you, which I am pretty certain is not how your boss jokes. He isn't joking with you, he is using you as a joke target. That ain't cool no matter the subject of the jesting."

Most jokes are pretty lame too.  That said though, just have a word with your boss about it and get him to pass the word down to the electrician and if need be, the electrician's company. Racist jokes and issues is usually a small matter that could be resolved easily but are instead, commonly left to propagate and escalate."

I know how group projects work; if you don't carry the freeloader and complain to faculty, then often times you become the problem.    If your friend hasn't the ability or motivation to do work in his desired field, you wouldn't be doing him any favors by giving him a positive review if he didn't earn it.  Better to hear it now, rather than right before he graduates, or when he loses a profitable job because he doesn't know/can't fulfill job requirements.    When he asked you, you shouldn't have lied.

OP then chose to complete those tasks instead, either of his own volition or after a conversation with what's-his-face.

Then everyone could see he was at least trying to put in some effort - this only happened as the deadline approached and he became worried about the grade when the major tasks had been taken care of.  I do agree that the better move as a friend would've been to tell him I couldn't bullshit on the peer assessment if he didn't get his act together, but I suppose I didn't think about that aspect of the project until it came to filling it in after we finished."

You don't just need to retake the failed course? That seems absurd if I'm reading it correctly.  Also, I'd say not the asshole. There is one person responsible for what happened to your friend and that person is him. If anything you may have done him a favor. If he couldn't handle the work he was getting this year without you doing it for him he probably would have an even tougher time in the more advanced courses down the line.

And then you lied to him about it, so he wouldn't be mad at you, while still leaving him in the dark to what you knew was really going on.  Those are the things that make you an asshole.  Giving him a bad score because he did bad work?  That's totally legitimate.  Not helping your friend when he's a lazy bum and about to waste thousands of dollars?

I mean, I'd be inclined to agree with you a little bit except when confronted about it instead of just saying ""Hey we needed the money, I'll pay it back to you when I can"" or any other number of things that an adult would say to another adult he proceeded to justify his behavior and blame his kid for being ungrateful totally skipping over the fact that he stole.

AmItheAsshole,3dbw1w,Funkingthefake,13,Wed Jul 15 02:05:16 2015 UTC,"To be honest, the hours are pretty reasonable."

AmItheAsshole,3dbw1w,the-incredible-ape,3,Wed Jul 15 02:07:30 2015 UTC,I think maybe you just got woken up from a nap.
AmItheAsshole,3dbw1w,the-incredible-ape,3,Wed Jul 15 02:38:03 2015 UTC,"You aren't an asshole, because you haven't actually done or said anything yet. Quietly fuming at him from your bed isn't being an asshole.  Now, action that wouldn't be asshole-ish would just be to have a chat with him and let him know you have funny hours. If it's possible for him to finish a little earlier, or whatever depending on when you finish work, he'll probably be happy enough, and if he can't, you might just have to get some ear plugs and play some white noise."
AmItheAsshole,3dbw1w,the-incredible-ape,2,Wed Jul 15 10:55:44 2015 UTC,"For me this hinges on whether you've politely asked him to not hammer/work while you are taking your nap.  Needing a nap is reasonable but getting pissed at someone for something they haven't even been asked not to do is not.   Obviously he's got to do the roof sometime and it simply requires that he make a lot of noise.  No way around it.   But, you guys could agree that he take a (say) 1h break so you could nap.   So, you're the asshole for being pissed if you haven't actually talked to him about it.   If he refuses to make even a small accommodation for your nap then maybe he's the asshole, unless he has a good reason.   So based on testimony given I say inconclusive."

AmItheAsshole,3dfcvq,Funkingthefake,-3,Wed Jul 15 20:58:41 2015 UTC,He was mad at losing at a game or something. I just knew he was really pissed.
AmItheAsshole,3dfcvq,Funkingthefake,10,Wed Jul 15 20:59:46 2015 UTC,"Okay, since you can't answer a simple question, you're an asshole or something."

Because you pointed out how useless this question is, and because OP wouldn't respond, we have invented a new flair for posts like this: Shit Post.     This has been added to the sidebar:    If your post is clearly a humble brag, or fails to give enough info to consider, or is obviously the work of someone who knows he's wrong and is just looking for attention, it will be marked Shit Post and ignored.

AmItheAsshole,3dfcvq,drjacksahib,3,Thu Jul 16 20:46:14 2015 UTC,"The fact that you can't give a reason for him flipping you off without using the phrase ""or something"" tells everyone reading that you are not giving a full or accurate description of the situation.  The fact you give no information of any value gives us nothing to form an opinion on.  We don't know if he was justified in telling you to fuck off...(What kind of game was it?  Did you cheat?  Is he just a sore loser? Were you even involved in the game?).  We don't know what kind of friends you are...(maybe you often tell each other to fuck off in good fun).   We don't even know if it was a game...(since you insist on saying ""or something"" I'm thinking it's more like you had sex with his girlfriend, or stole money from him when he was drunk, ""or something"".)  The reason he did what he did matters as much as the reason you responded.    Care to try again with a post that makes sense?"
AmItheAsshole,3dfcvq,Extramrdo,2,Thu Jul 16 13:36:49 2015 UTC,"Yep, you're an asshole. Now, a lot of people are going to say that the other guy was the asshole, but you sunk right on down there to his level."

AmItheAsshole,3darns,jirt282,3,Tue Jul 14 20:45:38 2015 UTC,"If I was prone to speculation, I'd say his girlfriend is the asshole, based on what you say.  A flirty female friend can be very intimidating, and his reasoning and timing are a giveaway.  Guys don't lose friends because they're flirty, and generally, if someone comes to the realization that you're manipulative without warning, there's probably someone whispering in his ear.    But, it's his choice, not his girlfriend's, and it's always been a policy of mine not to waste time on people who want to cast me aside.  As far as the manipulation thing? Who knows.  Maybe.  I mean, you did come here posting a scenario when you clearly weren't the asshole, and I always wonder what headgames people are playing when they do that.  Maybe you're insecure.  I don't know."
AmItheAsshole,3darns,Funkingthefake,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:17:40 2015 UTC,Thanks :) I guess I ought to explain myself-- I worry a lot that I'm egocentric and that I don't realize when I really AM being the dick. Which I guess is vain of me after all! But hopefully I'm not playing head games with this. It just makes my life a little less stressful to get multiple opinions.
AmItheAsshole,3darns,patchgrrl,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:31:46 2015 UTC,"I would wager he felt that you ""friend-zoned"" him and now his gf is insecure about him having female friends and has badmouthed you and he is picking up what she is laying down.    You are not the asshole."
AmItheAsshole,3darns,the-incredible-ape,0,Wed Jul 15 00:46:28 2015 UTC,"So, there is nothing so wrong about being nice just to win points with people.  It's manipulative, which is worse than you just doing it for fully genuine reasons, but it doesn't hurt anyone directly.  If your friends are being honest this seems like it's actually the case.  Everyone wants to be liked, that's not an asshole trait, it's normal.   wild-ass guess here - this guy's girlfriend is the jealous type and more or less forced him to say all this stuff.  He values sex (or the nearest approximation he's getting) more than your friendship.  In that case, she's the asshole, and he's the asshole for not putting a stop to the crazy-jealous train.  I had an ex that flat-out demanded I not only go no-contact with previous GFs, but also get rid of anything they'd given me.  Other GFs have been really nuts about girls who I was friends with because they saw them as threats.  Like coming home weeping about how awful this person was, who I had not even spoken with in months and months.  The crazy is strong with some people.   The GF probably sees you as a threat and gave him an ultimatum.  I would bet decent money that's she's basically putting ideas in his head. I wouldn't take it TOO personally.   I say: Not the asshole based on testimony provided."
AmItheAsshole,3darns,the-incredible-ape,2,Tue Jul 14 21:03:37 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your help! And wow, I'm sorry about your crazy exes! That sucks!"

AmItheAsshole,3da24y,flignir,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:10:35 2015 UTC,That slipped my mind! Will edit that in!
AmItheAsshole,3da24y,flignir,5,Tue Jul 14 18:11:43 2015 UTC,"So, let me see if I got this right.  Luke and Ben are both in a group of friends you're part of.  Luke is kind of a pain in the ass, because he's fussy about people being late when meeting and not including the whole group in things, even though he is frequently significantly late himself.  For some reason, this doesn't bother you as much as it seems to bother others.  Eventually, Ben and others get sick of Luke and stop including him altogether.   Now that Ben has a new group, you're still hanging out with both, and Ben's people are making fun of you for still hanging out with the guy they can't stand.    If all that is right, don't worry about it.  You're not the asshole.   As long as Ben & company still include you, you're on good terms with them.  Nobody's the asshole for making jokes about someone no one in the room likes.   If either group issues an ultimatum, and refuses to be friends with you just because you associate with the other one, take them up on their offer: never see them again and feel confident that they are the assholes."
AmItheAsshole,3da24y,Funkingthefake,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:22:56 2015 UTC,"Thanks, it still sucks to be in a position where you either satisfy one side or stay neutral but keep being fed remarks about doing so."
AmItheAsshole,3da24y,the-incredible-ape,3,Wed Jul 15 01:37:40 2015 UTC,Stop hanging around douchebags who are so petty and insecure they can't bear the thought of you socializing with other people.
AmItheAsshole,3da24y,the-incredible-ape,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:07:12 2015 UTC,"Well, I feel that most people I like that to a certain degree. But I agree that they are in the extreme here. I since then has moved on to mixing around with a much more 'secure' group."
AmItheAsshole,3da24y,csonnich,2,Wed Jul 15 01:31:37 2015 UTC,"I told them that what Luke did wasn't an issue to me as he personally did not upset me in anyway and I do not want to break a friendship just because I had to choose a side. They seem to accept my stance on the matter but would keep on making remarks about me being friends with Luke.   This is reasonable   if I was the asshole in choosing not to be sympathetic and not selecting a side to be with.   Well the implication here is that you'd have to be sympathetic to the idea of cutting someone off for (what you reasonably noted) were reasons that didn't really affect you.  By your own account, everyone seemed to accept that, too.  So what, you should have shown more loyalty through pettiness?  Eh... no.  This was bad behavior/etiquette on the part of both groups.  You are not under obligation to show loyalty through this type of petty shit any more than you are under obligation to show loyalty through breaking windows for fun.   Just because someone feels wronged doesn't mean you did something wrong.   I say not the asshole."
AmItheAsshole,3da24y,immrtlsaij,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:32:10 2015 UTC,"Thanks, it feels as if this is not the first time I have been in this situation before though. Guys in my country seem to take longer to age and they get really petty sometimes over small issues like this."
AmItheAsshole,3d7cdt,Theminerjames,30,Tue Jul 14 02:17:13 2015 UTC,"So your friend started a whole bunch of shit because you wouldn't lend him (a small amount of) money, and you decide that he's not a friend worth keeping around as a result.   That seems reasonable.  You are not an asshole for refusing to talk to him.  It would be big of you to forgive him and give him another chance, but not doing that (IMO) doesn't make you an asshole.  Sounds like a ""made your bed, sleep in it"" situation for the former friend."
AmItheAsshole,3d7cdt,the-incredible-ape,17,Tue Jul 14 02:30:48 2015 UTC,This is so clear cut... Is there something you're not telling in this version of events?
AmItheAsshole,3d7cdt,Jackthastripper,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:59:57 2015 UTC,Probably a fake story and just wants some attention.
AmItheAsshole,3d7cdt,Courier-6,14,Tue Jul 14 09:53:24 2015 UTC,"Why would you even ask this question? You set this up in a way to paint him in a terrible light and you in a good one, regardless of how it actually went. The only response here can be that you're not the asshole. You just want recognition?"
AmItheAsshole,3d7cdt,zjbird,8,Tue Jul 14 04:36:36 2015 UTC,"It's been over two years, maybe OP thinks he's an asshole for not giving him a second chance?"
AmItheAsshole,3d7cdt,Lamenardo,3,Tue Jul 14 14:10:02 2015 UTC,"Exactly.  His question is whether he's being an asshole by responding too harshly, not if there's some chance that someone thinks he's at fault for letting himself get Facebook-smeared."
AmItheAsshole,3d7cdt,flignir,3,Tue Jul 14 19:50:36 2015 UTC,"No, and your 'friend' is not a friend at all.  He's a vindictive frenemy at best.  You can forgive him, but NEVER FORGET that he can't be trusted.    At this point the best strategy for a reduced-drama existance is to cut people like this out of your life.  You don't need narcissistic vindictive drama-mongers pinching you for money and starting shit when they don't get what they want.  You are not the asshole, but if you are stupid enough to take him back and trust him again, you ARE a fool."
AmItheAsshole,3d7cdt,supershinythings,3,Tue Jul 14 07:26:57 2015 UTC,"Nah. He probably thinks since it's been over two years you might have forgiven him, but once bitten twice shy I guess. On the other hand, everyone deserves a second chance; it sounds like you're both pretty young, so perhaps he did something stupid, has changed, and grown up a bit. I assume you still have mutual contacts, and if you're both still at school you'll see him around a lot, so you'll probably know something of what he's like now. Bit more of an adult, or still someone who'd fuck you around?  I'd like to know a little more about the original fight. Five dollars isn't much, but it can be for some kids. What was the situation, why wouldn't you lend it and why was he so mad you didn't?"
AmItheAsshole,3d7cdt,Lamenardo,3,Tue Jul 14 14:09:06 2015 UTC,"Uhm... So, if we only look at the context of what you've given us there should be no question as to in that frame you are not an asshole.. basically the only thing you've done according to above is be the victim and you are now contemplating forgiveness. However, looking at the fact that you've chosen to state ""a couple of them beat him up but that is besides the point"" when it is highly relevant to being an asshole or not since it is a direct consequence of your actions towards your friends, As others have asked... what is your point of asking if you are not going to give the full story?"
AmItheAsshole,3d7cdt,_Gwink_,4,Tue Jul 14 16:09:28 2015 UTC,"You are not an asshole for that. Also, report it. Make sure he can't do that again."
AmItheAsshole,3d7cdt,Viperbunny,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:43:41 2015 UTC,"Your communication could have been better. But she is being unreasonable. She knows you do this every year. If she doesn't want to go, fine, but she can live without you for three days. Unless you really always choose your friends (which I doubt you are) she needs to learn that it is healthy for you to do things apart sometimes.    I would sit her down and be frank with her. Tell her she is more than welcome to come, but it is okay of she doesn't want to. It is tradition and you are going. It is only three days and it is something you really treasure and you hope that she can understand. If she tries to cry and manipulate you I would call her out on it. It won't end well, but she needs to grow up."

I've never had an issue with their customer service, in fact, it has been the best I've received in my experience. I have had a couple of issues pop up with the merchandise before.  Honestly, I think you are kind of being an asshole. I definitely rolled my eyes a few times. Maybe try finding a number to the investigation department, rather than the online help chat? Good luck."
AmItheAsshole,3d6n5l,Tport17,16,Mon Jul 13 23:26:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you were being a major dick. Customer service doesn't even have the power to give you a refund, so no use hating them."
AmItheAsshole,3d6n5l,sweetjingle,2,Tue Jul 14 02:11:29 2015 UTC,I got a full refund and they instantly reshipped my order when I rang up. Oh and also got 3months extra Prime.  Only to find that the package had originally arrived but the dog had hid it.
AmItheAsshole,3d6n5l,supermanspider,14,Tue Jul 21 16:57:37 2015 UTC,"Unless they personally insulted, condescended to, or dissed you (as opposed to doing a honest, albeit bad job) there's no cause to be a dick to customer service, ever."
AmItheAsshole,3d6n5l,the-incredible-ape,9,Tue Jul 14 02:28:50 2015 UTC,"You were upset and you had every right to be upset.  The delivery problem is unacceptable customer service. But, you didn't call Old Man Amazon, you called customer support.  You talked to a couple of people who would honestly love nothing more to give you your merchandise.  It's not like they're playing with it while they're talking to you.  Yes, it's shitty that they're giving you a runaround, but their job isn't getting pissed on, it's trying to resolve customer complaints.  And not giving your phone number? Pretty petty, since they already have your address and your credit card info.    Long and short, you're the asshole because your actions didn't do anything to help your situation, and just made someone miserable for no reason.  Edit 1: grammaering.  Edit2: don't get me wrong; this is the kind of asshole we can all turn into, and I've had similar exchanges.  I mean, fuck, ask my therapist.  Sometimes it's so hard not to be the asshole."
AmItheAsshole,3d6n5l,Funkingthefake,11,Tue Jul 14 03:27:14 2015 UTC,"I would say kind of because, while you have every right to be frustrated, you're taking your frustration out on the wrong dude."
AmItheAsshole,3d6n5l,dragongrl,26,Tue Jul 14 02:06:29 2015 UTC,"They really sent you the log after you said that? Point in their favor.  But yeah, customer service reps really have little power and often get people like you being dicks when they're just doing the most they can. Which isn't much, but that's not their fault. I'm sorry you had a horrible experience with your package (I have too, I fking hate Amazon) but you're taking it out on the wrong people.   I feel your pain so I don't want to call you an asshole so we'll just use your words and name you a dick."
AmItheAsshole,3d6n5l,Abelithea,5,Mon Jul 13 23:04:32 2015 UTC,I would also like to say that the 2 packages lost/stolen added up to be worth $442.66 which is a lot of money for me.
AmItheAsshole,3d6n5l,Abelithea,23,Mon Jul 13 23:16:18 2015 UTC,It's a lot of money to me too and you have every right to be furious. Just don't take it out on the people who don't deserve it.
AmItheAsshole,3d6n5l,Pepperyfish,9,Tue Jul 14 00:12:59 2015 UTC,this is the key point. If say the packages had been stolen because the delivery guy left them on the porch without bothering to ring the doorbell you would be completely justified in yelling at the delivery guy. All you do when you yell at customer service like this is make their day worse and make them not want to help you so even if it is their fault you are better off not yelling at them.
AmItheAsshole,3d6n5l,beccafool,9,Tue Jul 14 02:25:38 2015 UTC,"If the package is marked as ""delivered,"" you should have contacted USPS or UPS or whoever dropped the package. They will have to reimburse the seller for their shitty shipment.   I just dealt with this a few days ago - my package was marked as delivered and ""signed by a coworker"", but our office was closed on that day so it was impossible for her to have signed for it. We found the box destroyed by rain, blown into nearby bushes, and empty - the product likely stolen by a passerby. I called UPS and they fixed everything in about 10 minutes."
AmItheAsshole,3d6n5l,TrxpThxm,4,Tue Jul 14 02:42:23 2015 UTC,You're an asshole.   Sounds to me you didn't have a responsible relationship with your ups/fed ex guy and a special place to stash your packages and you are wanting something for free while being a dick to a CSR and their manager who obviously have no signing power.  They deal with people like you all day and you don't get shit for being a jerk.
AmItheAsshole,3d6n5l,vanguard_anon,8,Tue Jul 14 06:34:26 2015 UTC,"This is a tough one for me.  You were super rough on guys that weren't actually the problem.  Also, the tracking info says that it was delivered so I can see Amazon's point there.  However, they should be hitting the dates they set and I can see why you would push back when they just set a few new dates.  I'm going to say you were a little assholish but not a full bore asshole."
AmItheAsshole,3d6n5l,Viperbunny,3,Tue Jul 14 02:54:25 2015 UTC,"Look, I understand being upset. You have the right to be, but you were being a massive asshole. This customer service person didn't do anything to you to deserve this. He was doing what he was instructed to do and you were aggressive from the start. You weren't motivating him to help you by acting thus way.  What you should have done is get the name of the person you dealt with before. Then you should ask for a supervisor to resolve this issue as it has not been resolved.  You can also stop payment on it if you report the issue to your bank."
AmItheAsshole,3d6n5l,Diarygirl,2,Tue Jul 14 03:38:03 2015 UTC,"It's so important to get the person's name you're dealing with.

They can't refund without a proper investigation (Some customers just claim to not have received their order despite so.), and they are not in a position to give you some 'freebie' or whatsoever too. They needed time and you went straight to being a dick.  You are upset about the delivery service and I have been in that situation before, with a larger, more costly order even. However, you were barking up the wrong tree and did not make the problem any easier to be resolved."
AmItheAsshole,3d6n5l,zjbird,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:43:50 2015 UTC,"I'm too late to be seriously considered for voting, but the only asshole in this equation is the invisible and unreachable person who set up the dispute service procedure in a way that means that only people who can do nothing about the problem and who have no information about the problem are reachable to the customer looking for a solution.  Especially, considering that Amazon gives out a time period to wait for the investigation to end, it is absurd that you do not get a more detailed response than that ""the investigation is not finished"" when that time limit is not honored.  Yes, you are rude and aggressive to the customer service reps, but you have reason to be because they are continuing to deliver you the same lie that has burnt you twice already, and you have no means by which to reach the party that really deserves an earful, so I would be VERY impressed with you if you manged to be polite and friendly through the entire process.   Failure to impress me with your patience is not enough of an outrage to make you the asshole.  It just makes you normal."

You could have said something like, ""if you can't help me, could you put me through to someone who can?""

Though for harmony with you mom, I'll echo /u/mattempirelic and add to it a suggestion of grabbing a batch of tithing envelopes (presuming the church has them), and put a dollar in one each time you go. That way your Mom can't see how much you are giving if she will have a problem with only a dollar, but you can put something in so she can see that you are.  Edit to add: If you just put an empty envelope in there, then you probably are crossing the line to asshole."

There are lots of churches I don't believe in so I don't give to any of them.  As a parent though, it would break my heart if my children couldn't talk to me about their beliefs and pretended (lied) that they shared mine when they didn't.  Maybe your mom is a crazy bitch that would yell and scream and make your life hell if you were honest with her.  I'm not judging you, I don't know.

If she was speaking professionally, she is an idiot, who probably drew more attention to what she deemed a negative post than it would have gotten if she kept her mouth shut.

Hell many employers will check a potential employee's Facebook to get an idea of personality. However, all you did was express your sincere personal beliefs about a close-to-home subject in your life. Your honesty was not meant to harm in any way shape or form and seems to have just been aimed towards self-questioning of the productivity of your last job!  Therefore, you're not an asshole at all.

You are not in high school anymore. Grow up. No matter how much you were traumatized by your boss, as an adult, you should face it, not run from it. Realize that your friend should be more important for you than a boss, but up to now all your actions indicate otherwise. You are choosing to appeal to your ex-boss over your friend. You are making his evening more enjoyable by not being there, and in turn ruining yours and your friend's. And all of that why? Because you are afraid to have an encounter with your boss. You are afraid to make choices. You are afraid of being in the driver seat of your life. You are letting others control your life. You are being a beta, a slave to your environment and to other's choices. Go to the wedding, and - if forced to - even smile at your ex-boss to let him know that he ain't got shit on you. Enjoy the wedding, make your friend happy, and don't let your boss think that he's still got control over you, cause no matter how much you deny it, YOU ARE BEING CONTROLLED BY HIM RIGHT FUCKING NOW.   You might think that if your friend respected you, he wouldn't have invited the boss, and you are partially right, but you can't really expect people to take sides in situations like this. They are under a lot of stress and simply don't have the nerves to deal with childish shit like this. They will do what's best for them, and in this case it's inviting the boss, cause if he finds out there was a wedding and he wasn't invited, it might not be good for your friend career wise.   So again, go to the wedding, no matter what. Be an alpha. Control your own life and be happy. Cause I'm damn sure if you don't go you'll end up regretting it."

My husband took it upon himself to transport his mother (paid for her, too), so I would have spent an entire long weekend, in close quarters with her. Nope ...  The other was a 5 hour flight away. We paid thousands, to have four members of my family attend. That was enough. The weddings were for a bride/groom I've seen about 8 times each, in my life, so no closeness/no regrets. The bride, in the 1st situation, didn't bother to attend either of my kids' weddings, after my family flew to attend hers.

This ended up in a few more days with discussions with lawyers and in the end my lawyer just advised to let it go, since in this country, litigation would not be worth it, especially when I had a nice job lined up somewhere else.

This is the most important day in your friends life, and they have asked to share it with you because they care about you!  With that in mind, the tension with your ex-co-worker would have to be very substantial for you to not be the asshole. You might be justified, but I can only imagine a few ways where you would be ok.  My advice is to call up your friend, make sure that you aren't sitting together at the reception, and just have a good day celebrating with your friends!  But as I said, it depends on how close you are to the bride/groom, and how bad the tension really is between you and the ex-co-worker. So you might be the asshole. And you might not be."

AmItheAsshole,3cz7sc,Cookiesallnight,3,Sun Jul 12 08:43:53 2015 UTC,"No, your mother is the asshole, but I kind of feel sorry for her.   It sounds like she is probably jealous of your stepbrother on your behalf, and she just wants to make sure you don't get a raw deal, but the way she's going about things is a bit assholish.   It's not her car and it's a bit ghoulish to talk about your father dying, and if she doesn't want to be embarrassed in front of people, she probably shouldn't be talking about this stuff around them.  So here's how you can help her - next time you sense she's talking nonsense that will embarrass her in front of people, say you'll talk about it later and change the subject."

If its in pretty good condition I would hop on it . Plus they have a pretty decent resale value, if I'm not mistaken, so selling it to someone who's into classic muscle cars or collector cars would probably pay some coin for it if nothing else. Of course depending on the condition of the car.  Also, I think that you are NOT the asshole. Not everybody are into those kind of cars. I would take it and then give it to your brother who would love the hell out of it. You'll come across that fits you soon enough, plus if iyou do I'm pretty sure that karma will serve you something more you style."

Maybe he felt excluded in spite of the language barrier. Maybe he thought you were rude, even though you couldn't understand him.

AmItheAsshole,3cyy2q,I-BMO-I,5,Sun Jul 12 11:44:07 2015 UTC,"Give a truthful and accurate example of how you and 'Bob' would complain about the game. In any case, insulting and yelling at your friends ain't a good way to communicate and makes you an unpleasant person to play with.   Also, maybe your friends were fine with 'Bob' as the way he voiced his complains were clearly made in jest, wasn't insulting to them or was funny / lighthearted."
AmItheAsshole,3cyy2q,kwertyuiop,2,Sun Jul 12 03:51:37 2015 UTC,"You probably have a large bias towards how you and your friend complain (seeing as you are one of the people complaining). You see it as you and your friend making the same observation and you getting criticised for it and your friend being praised, however from the rest of your play group's perspective you are probably dealing with the situation (e.g. lee sin being fed) in different ways. Your tone of voice and intent for example can make a big difference, you may say ""Fuck this game, our stupid mid fed lee sin, why bother playing any more against this op champ"" and ""bob"" may say ""hey -mid- you should have probably played less aggressive in the early game, then lee sin wouldn't have been as much of a problem"". This is obviously an extreme example but you can see that whilst you are both saying the same thing the intent is very different. However, regardless of your play group treating you and bob differently, the bigger issue is the fact that you are taking the game far too seriously and are clearly getting angry and stressed out at people who are meant to be your friends. People who only concentrate on winning instead of having fun aren't enjoyable to play with and what you need to concentrate on is relaxing while playing and concentrate on having fun rather than being mega tryhard. Whilst its fine to offer constructive criticism it sounds like thats not whats happening, if you're playing ranked try playing unranked instead for a while to take some of the pressure off or play with your friends on your smurf accounts so you don't get so stressed. So yes you are being an asshole, that doesn't mean bob or your other friends aren't being assholes but you most certainly are."

AmItheAsshole,3cwdo9,matt2nyy,15,Sat Jul 11 09:45:11 2015 UTC,"You acted like a teenager and are continuing to do so. If visiting your dad makes you truly miserable, then don't go. Avoiding your aunt and siblings without an explanation when they have done nothing wrong is pretty unfair. You don't want to deal with them because it could cause you some drama, but if you want to be an adult then you need to start acting like one. Text your aunt. Apologize for avoiding her, tell her you love her, but your father said something incredibly hurtful to you and you don't want him in your life right now. Tell her you are more than happy to talk with her as long as she can respect your wishes. If she can't, then cut off contact with her.   Your siblings are younger, so they are most likely being used by your dad. If you need to stop talking to them because it is really your dad, I understand. You may consider sending them a letter so they can know why you aren't around.  As an adult, you don't have to associate with anyone you don't wan't to associate with. That said, you need to understand a bit about adult relationships because you don't have a good handle on that from what you have said. First off, 17 isn't an adult. It is almost an adult. Even then, 18 is the legal age for you to be an adult, but there is no magical transformation. You are mad at them for not treating you like an adult, but you aren't acting like one. While I do believe they are not very mature, you didn't handle any of this well. Talking things out, trying to mend things, that is the adult thing to do. It's normal to be hurt, but it sounds like you were looking for an excuse to get away. You have the right to do it either way, but you used this one blow up to let yourself off the hook.  Another thing that is hard for you to realize at that age is thst parents have a hard time relating to adult childern. You are still his child. It can be hard to see you as responsible for your own life, and your attitude isn't helping. I am 29, married, and have 2 kids, and I still have to remind my family that I am an adult capable of handling things. Sometimes they forget and see me as their child, especially when I am ill. You have to learn to talk to them without blowing up. You can hold your own and make yourself clear without fighting.  I don't think you are an asshole, but I do think you are a bit naive as to how adults behave."

Also, its not like I can just drive to her house and apologize. They live two hours away and it would be a hassle to travel 4 hours round trip to see my aunt and apologize, especially when all she wants is for me to repair my relationship with my father, something i have no interest in doing."

AmItheAsshole,3cty60,entropydecreaser,20,Fri Jul 10 19:22:00 2015 UTC,"You have every right to be angry. She lied about her age which could have gotten you in serious legal trouble. I don't know the laws in Canada, but in the US you wouldn't be out of hot water yet. The age of consent can protect people within a certain age range, but it could still be illegal for a much older adult to have sex with a minor. Double check for Romeo and Juliet laws and make sure that you can't get in legal trouble. Don't try to make up with her. Cut off contact. You don't want to give any indication that you are okay with the fact that you had sex with a 16 year old (remember your words can be manipulated and used against you). Even if she can't get you in legal trouble, she could still socially shame you if she's that kind of person."

I think you shouldn't do what someone else said, which is ignore her. She may be really screwed up, like you explained, so you should explain your reasoning, just so she isn't messed up.

Also she did lie, just not to your face. She lied when she said her age was 19 on Tinder. Since the minimum age on Tinder is 18, you technically cannot be blamed for assuming she was at least 18, anyway. If everything else on her profile was correct, why should you have to assume that the age might be a lie? She was a bit silly, made a mistake, and is probably taking time to process it all, and your apology as well.   I have no idea if this would be considered creepy, but it occurred to me if you feel really bad about it, perhaps you could send a box of chocolates or flowers or something to her...but on the other hand her parents might be the kind who would object to such things, so maybe not."

Even if she didn't speak the lie, she set up the profile and had a responsibility to set you straight.    As for you, I think you were perfectly justified in feeling the anger, but that's not an unlimited license to express it in any context.  You just had sex with a virgin, couldn't you show a little self-control or emotional consideration and not turn into a rage beast?  Yes, you had a valid grievance, but I think it makes you the asshole to fly off the handle and scream at her & probably scare her when you found out that she's a stupid kid that did something dumb at your expense.  I don't think you screwed her up emotionally for life, but now she's got one sexual experience in life, and instead of it being fun and supportive and accepting, it's a scary, painful, unpredictable ordeal that ends with her being berated.  It sucks that she lied, but in terms of the law you aren't 100% free of the obligation to KNOW that your partner is of a certain age.  So, since you're the only adult in the situation, you bear some blame, whatever the law in Canada is.  I think you could have just told her that was unacceptable, but you lost control."

So I guess you're both assholes in so far as you're both human, but all I can say is I hope you both forgive yourselves, learn from your mistakes and each treat your next tinder matches better than you treated each other."
AmItheAsshole,3cty60,the-incredible-ape,1 point,Sun Jul 12 14:00:24 2015 UTC,"I'll throw in my two cents.   I agree with some of the others here and say that neither of your are assholes, and unfortunate mistakes were made. I don't want to say that yelling at her was an appropriate or correct thing to do, but I can completely understand your reaction. I don't know the law exactly, but I'm pretty sure that having sex with an underage person could end up with you being labeled as a sex offender, which could severely ruin your life. And freaking out about that because of one girl's mistake/lie is a understandable reaction.   Now from her point of view, she thought that the age difference was not a big deal. She probably got really scared when you yelled at her. And that will, unfortunately, have a strong impact on her opinion of sex.   I would say that the best thing for you to do for now is to make sure you tell her that you feel bad about the way you reacted, and explain very clearly that a guy having sex with an underage girl can be very, very bad for him. And you were afraid about what might have happened to you. More importantly, however, is make sure she's ok. She might have been in a bad spot before, and if so this didn't help. Also, explain to her that you're no longer mad with her, but you're not comfortable with having relations with a girl of her age, and advise her to only seek out relationships with people closer to her age.   I hope both of you will be ok after this."
AmItheAsshole,3cty60,the-incredible-ape,-1,Sat Jul 11 02:47:29 2015 UTC,"Sure, I get why you were upset. I understand that this was your natural reaction in the heat of the moment. But yes, you could most definitely have handled it better.  She did never lie to you. She may not have thought it was a big deal (maybe she knew about the age of consent so she knew there'd be no legal trouble) and seriously did not even think to tell you. As far as I understand you need to be over 18 to join Tinder so there was a good reason for her to lie on her profile.  It is hard to stop your initial reaction when you are upset. However, you should have stopped and remembered that you were with an insecure and inexperienced teenager in an extremely sensitive situation and calmed down enough to repair the damage you'd done, before leaving. If you were unable to calm down enough to think about it rationally before you stormed out, you need to work on your anger management. However, I don't think you were unable to think rationally, I just think your rationale was a little self-centered so that you failed to see the whole picture. You were a bit of an asshole, yes."
AmItheAsshole,3cty60,toms_face,-4,Fri Jul 10 22:28:23 2015 UTC,"This story sounds a little bit made up but I'll assume it's all real.   I think your reaction was understandable.  At the time, you were under the impression that you were just tricked into committing a serious crime that had the potential to ruin your life permanently.  Furthermore, you'd been tricked into sex.  Now, I think we both agree that this was not the MOST nefarious lie/sex anyone's ever engaged in... but depending on circumstances, lying to someone in order to get them to sleep with you can be considered rape.  I'm not saying that this should be treated as a rape, of course... but just to give color to the fact that what she did was wrong.   I think an emotional outburst in that situation doesn't make you an asshole.  It created a very unfortunate situation for this girl, and I can also understand why she'd be upset.  But to sum it up, she made some terrible choices and you bore some of the consequences of those bad choices, and your anger was reasonable IMO.   Now, turning reasonable anger on a vulnerable 16-year-old girl still kinda sucks... but it doesn't make you an outright asshole, IMO.    I had every right to be upset - I probably should have just handled it better.   This sums it up I think.  A sincere apology is about all you can do here."

You evaluated all possible options and picked the one that caused the bird the least suffering. If you didn't believe you could save it you did the right thing. Most people would not even consider trying to nurse a bird so for you to even think to try speaks extremely highly of your character.
AmItheAsshole,3cv4vb,broken-instincts12,7,Sat Jul 11 01:25:06 2015 UTC,"You considered all your options and decided to do what's best for this little bird. He wouldn't have survived on his own, without the ability to fly he would have been eaten by a predator, starved or died from infection on his wing. All of which aren't nice ways to die.  It's very unlikely that you could have nursed him back to health, especially if you're not a vet, don't have any access to antibiotics and even if you had taken him to a vet, the vast majority of them have absolutely no experience with treating little birds.  You made a sensible decision, disregarding your own feelings. That's the most noble thing you could do. It's tough for you, but it's best for the bird.  The only thing you could have done is maybe end his life even quicker, for example by placing him on the pavement and stomping on him or his head."

No, this is one of those times when you're the sane one and everyone else is wrong, I think.   Why do they even have a ceremony for this?? What the hell?  My personal rant: I think this is exactly the kind of crap that creates entitled kids who can't handle real life.  If the mere fact of stacking up blocks and spelling a word or two earns you this big event, I can only imagine the giant participation trophies and gold stars for nothing in these childrens' future.

But, in the case of parents, irrational sentimentality seems to be a hell of a lot more popular and common around children's milestones than stoic realism.  Also, there is every reason to believe that a similarly unimpressed parent will feign excitement and pride over such milestones in the hopes that it will get their children started on the path to recognizing the value of hard work and achievement.  (In theory, celebration at completing this easy thing will motivate a very young child to put effort into the next somewhat harder thing, etc. etc.)  Given that, I don't know what is driving you to want to repeatedly insist that your wife hear your lack of enthusiasm.  You're not wrong to think it, but your description of the situation makes it sounds like you deliberately found multiple opportunities to make your wife acknowledge how pointless you think this all is.  That is an asshole move.  If she's trying to do something good for your child, and you're willing to play along, why do you have to find a way to put the focus on you and how you aren't really getting into the spirit of it?"

Your wife apparently thinks it is. You gain nothing by being contrary about it (even if you're right!), but do stand to benefit from just sucking it up and being supportive. You don't even have to be excited about the graduation; just be excited that your wife is excited.  Even if she knows you aren't particularly excited about it, just supporting her in her excitement will go a surprisingly long way.

AmItheAsshole,3csq8g,Kawaii_Kun,18,Fri Jul 10 13:48:20 2015 UTC,Not the asshole. You're in a really difficult situation right now and it's no wonder your temper is short.  But realise something. Your father isn't the only problem here. The fact that your mother puts up with and apologises/makes excuses for his behaviour is also a problem.  This is not the kind of relationship you want to have when you are an adult. Remember this.  Sometimes our parents teach us how to be. Sometimes they teach us now not to be. Both lessons are important.
AmItheAsshole,3csq8g,sandra_nz,7,Fri Jul 10 14:32:42 2015 UTC,"You are not the asshole here. You have every right to be angry, but don't let it consume you. People like your father thrive on the misery of others. They relish making others feel like they don't matter. Don't give him the satisfaction.  Also, don't expect your mom to ever take your side. She is an enabler and will always defend him. She is in the wrong here too.  Do your best to ignore their bad behavior until you can get out of this situation. Then you can leave and never deal with them again unless you want to."
AmItheAsshole,3csq8g,Viperbunny,4,Fri Jul 10 17:58:26 2015 UTC,"but this time the excuse is that there is a ghost or something possessed father and that why he's like that and some monks are coming to fix him.          The ghost is called alcohol and the monks should be AA. Seriously, your father is an ass. I get why your family wants to help him, but they are going about it in completely the wrong way.   You said that your family is on vacation in Vietnam. Are you visiting family there? The culture context of your family makes a big difference in terms of whether or not you're the asshole here. I know in some Asian cultures it's taboo to make family problems public, so if that's the case in Vietnamese culture, I can understand why your family would be upset about a public out burst. You certainly are in the right to be angry at your father, but your actions may have been rude and embarrassing for the family with in certain cultures.       Just to clarify, your father is definitely an ass. Your family members are assholes to for how they are handling it at your expense. However, you could also be an asshole for making a public display of your families problems depending on cultural norms."
AmItheAsshole,3csq8g,ArtGoftheHunt,5,Fri Jul 10 17:59:16 2015 UTC,It kind of sounds like your mom should check out AlAnon.  It's a support group for the spouses and close relatives of alcoholics.  It's just the whole thing about your mom trying to make things slide with how you felt about your dad seems somewhat co-dependant-ish.  I'm not a psychologist and I don't want to be throwing out brash diagnoses but that sort of what it sounds like.  AlAnon just kind of helps people get over those tendencies.  Your dad was trying to make it seem like his asshole behavior is completely excuse able because he was drunk and that's not okay.  I think it's very important for people to know how it really is.

Your dad and mom have a lot of shit to work out but they choose to ignore them because they are more scared of being apart/alone than they are of staying together regardless of the collateral damage. I hope both for you and for them that they either deal with their problems or seek help doing so before it has permanent effect on you and your sister.

It's not about 'embarrassing the family', it's about causing a disruption in public. Can't blame you for being angry, but you gotta learn to contain it. It's not fair, no. But you need to learn how to bide your time. Time and a place for everything, and a public mall is not that place.  I understand it's tough for your mother, but...she's partly to blame. It can be tough to accept your husband's an asshole, and to live with that type of abuse, and accept that it is abuse. She doesn't want to blame him. She doesn't want to blame him. I get that it's hard. But she's putting him over her children. Over the well-being of her children. She was more upset about the embarrassment, than the fact that your father hurt you, deliberately. She's not abusing you, she's enabling it. He's an asshole...and why? She's letting him be so.  Check out /r/raisedbynarcissists. Not saying he is one, but you might find some helpful advice over there for how to live with a ""sick"" father with a ghost."

She was diagnosed with stage four esophageal cancer.  We tried to make peace, but she was super bitchy too, and was judging and criticizing and just being a total pain in the ass, which, hey, she's been dealt the worst hand, I can understand that.  But I kept thinking, 'why am I putting up with this from someone who was abusive, wasn't there, and then shut me out of her life?' So I blocked it out.  I wasn't there. I didn't return her call when it was the last time she could talk, I wasn't there her last moments, and I didn't go to her funeral.  My mom was a stone cold bitch.  She did things I could never forgive, and now, I never will.  What I didn't understand, and what  I'd like to tell you, is that you don't make peace for her, you do it for you.

If you don't really think you will regret it in 10 or 20 years, you can end it now if you want, and go read some posts on /r/raisedbynarcissists to feel better. Based on the way she's treated you, this is a reasonable action to take.   You could have some contact with her, but I wouldn't stand by her side and let her throw shit at you until she dies."
AmItheAsshole,3crz7g,Muffinizer1,3,Fri Jul 10 12:39:36 2015 UTC,"I think your mother sounds like a bit of a bitch. She's now been given (at least in her eyes) the greatest justification/excuse to be even more bitchy.   If someone (you, the hero) calls her out on her bitchiness she can just say, ""Shut up I have cancer I'm dying, you're being so cruel, leave me alone.""  That in itself is one of the cruelest things anybody could possibly do to a person. Using their own misfortune to make others feel like shit. If you defend what you believe is right, most likely you'll feel like shit yourself because you're criticising the actions of a seriously ill person, and others will go against you because they feel it's easier and more 'moral' to support a dying older woman than it is a healthy young woman (you).  You have other shit going on in your life as well, your bf's cousin's death etc. I think you are without a doubt not the asshole. You're mum is a bitch, your brother is a normal person, you're someone who wants to make everybody's life a little easier."
AmItheAsshole,3crz7g,megaman1410,5,Fri Jul 10 11:51:01 2015 UTC,"Being estranged from age 13 from mom wasn't your choice, I'm guessing, because kids that age usually don't have the choice. Since she hasn't been a mom to you for that long, and you're an adult, she really has no right to give input on your life choices now. Sounds like you're trying to deal with her being shitty to you and your brother, and doing the best you can. You're not the asshole."
AmItheAsshole,3crz7g,_DOA_,3,Fri Jul 10 15:21:09 2015 UTC,Your mom has cancer. That doesn't stop her from being an asshole. Clearly she only cares for herself. Don't let her use this time to make you and your brother miserable. Go and pick him up. Don't stay with her. Let any family you think would want to be there know that she has made it clear thst she doesn't want you there (regardless of what she tells others). Don't do anything you feel uncomfortable with. A person with a potentially terminal illness doesn't sudden become a better person because she is suffering. If she is alone in the hospital it is for a reason. Do what you need to do to make your peace with her for your own sake. The rest is on her.

I don't think you're an asshole... yet. However, you made a commitment to your family to be there and support your brother. I do think you should go through with that commitment.  But as for the future, that's up to you to decide.   Yes, that's the only mother you'll ever have, but if she's not been a good mother to you and your brothers (and if you've been estranged for 8 years then I'm guessing not) then there is a question about how much time and support you can reasonably be expected to give. And that's really your decision to make.  My mum went through a similar thing when my dad's mother was dying. She never liked my mum (because my mum came from a poor background), yet my mum decided to be nothing but kind and caring for her during her last days. I know it's something she's proud of doing, for my dad's sake. But that was a different circumstance to yours, so please don't think I'm saying you should do the same!  Whatever you decide, try and consider how you will feel about the decision in the future. Maybe there is a middle ground you can find where you maintain limited contact with her. That will help you feel like you 'did your bit' whilst maintaining your own sanity!"
AmItheAsshole,3crz7g,sandra_nz,2,Fri Jul 10 09:56:54 2015 UTC,"Your mother is treating you badly, maybe because she subconsciously wants to push you away before she dies so it's less painful for both of you.    I think this isn't so much an ""asshole"" situation either way... but you should take the high road and put up with your mom's shit for as long as it takes.  She needs you guys (even if she claims otherwise) and the right thing to do is be there even when she tries to send you away (either explicitly or by being a bitch to you.)

AmItheAsshole,3coc8g,CIDC,1 point,Thu Jul 9 23:53:59 2015 UTC,Ah you have a point. Good spot.
AmItheAsshole,3coc8g,the-incredible-ape,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:22:20 2015 UTC,"It really depends on exactly what you're saying to her, without that I can't say if you're an asshole.  Did you explain your stance to her ambiguously ""nah don't really think so right now"" or did you spell it out, ""look, we're not getting back together, not now, not ever, and the nudes are not going to convince me, as great as they are""?  There is a big difference between leaving the door open a crack (so nudes can fly in) or closing it firmly so that she knows it's really over.  If you do the former, you're an asshole, if the latter, you're not."
AmItheAsshole,3coc8g,90ne1,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:44:29 2015 UTC,"As some people already said, as long as you're being clear to her that you don't want a relationship, you're not an asshole. If you're not communicating clearly your intentions and letting her believe there's a chance so she'll keep sending them, though, that's pretty low."
AmItheAsshole,3coc8g,UnorthodoxViking,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:17:30 2015 UTC,Depends on how you let her know that you are not interested in a relationship. If you were direct and clear with your message to her then no you are not the asshole.

AmItheAsshole,3coc8g,MikeYFItalian,-5,Mon Jul 13 08:51:05 2015 UTC,We'll have to see these pictures to determine that.
AmItheAsshole,3coexs,Doctorjames25,11,Thu Jul 9 14:09:56 2015 UTC,You're not the asshole. He needs to learn from his mistakes and start taking the blame for things that are his fault and the fact that you aren't babying him is a good thing rather than being an asshole.
AmItheAsshole,3coexs,Pattyfactor,7,Thu Jul 9 17:00:25 2015 UTC,"You are not the asshole. Particularly in reference to rent. If you took the house in exchange for money and he took the money and wants to live with you rent free, he is double dipping. Getting the money and the house. Paying rent is covering expenses. You shouldn't have to pay for his water, electric, etc. He needs to man up from the sound of things.   Regarding the car, abandoned cars are unsightly and detract from your home and it's value. If it's stored in an otherwise unused garage, it's a bit different."
AmItheAsshole,3coexs,patchgrrl,2,Thu Jul 9 18:58:24 2015 UTC,No it wouldn't be.  It would be stored at the end of my driveway in the yard.
AmItheAsshole,3coexs,patchgrrl,2,Thu Jul 9 19:11:31 2015 UTC,"Oh hell no.  Your brother is an asshole, dude. Not you."
AmItheAsshole,3coexs,headless_bourgeoisie,5,Fri Jul 10 14:53:28 2015 UTC,"Your brother is obviously in a bad place and I think he needs some tough love. If you let him keep his car at your place you will be further enabling his bad behavior. So, no, I don't think you are the asshole.  Congratulations on kicking heroin, by the way."
AmItheAsshole,3coexs,ConorYEAH,3,Thu Jul 9 19:55:13 2015 UTC,"Are you made worse-off by him leaving his car at your place?  It doesn't seem to me that you are.  Is he made better off by it?  Certainly, if the alternative is that his car gets towed.    I get that you've run out patience with your brother's life choices, but it sounds to me like you're trying to punish him - albeit gently - for his general irresponsibility.  You're right to point it out to him, but if you can do your brother a favour at no real cost to yourself, you should.  Otherwise, yeah, sorry but I think you're just being an asshole."
AmItheAsshole,3coexs,ConorYEAH,4,Thu Jul 9 19:00:00 2015 UTC,"Yes I am made worse off by having his car at my place.  My drive way fits two cars.  My gf and I have 3 cars and already have to park one of the cars we have in part of the yard which then we have to play musical cars with whenever we have to mow or do yard work.  Given that may brother isn't responsible already who says he's going to register his car in three months and get insurance like he's supposed too.  He blames the insurance company for his current situation so if anything happens to his car during the 3 months regardless of any kind of agreement I make with him, he'll still blame me and it'll still be more shit I have to deal with down the road.  Personal agreements notoriously fail in court, written or not and I'm not too keen in having to file something under my homeowners insurance if his car gets damaged while it's here or if he let's his insurance lapse again.   Additionally he has plenty of money to pay to store his car appropriately for 3 months which won't kill him to do.  Why should he keep it my yard as opposed to a place meant for storing unused stuff?"
AmItheAsshole,3coexs,Phatsteppin,3,Thu Jul 9 19:08:06 2015 UTC,"Well then, if you don't have room for it, that's completely different.  No, not asshole.  You have too many cars though."
AmItheAsshole,3coexs,13798246,2,Thu Jul 9 19:29:31 2015 UTC,Lol we me and my gf both have a car and then we have an SUV for winter use and hauling stuff to big to fit in our cars.  It doesn't get good gas mileage so I try not to drive it if I don't have too
AmItheAsshole,3coexs,Not_a_Zaku,3,Thu Jul 9 20:14:08 2015 UTC,"If you have the space, I'd say you are being a slight asshole. Doesn't sound like it's worth the fight if it doesn't cause you much inconvenience."
AmItheAsshole,3coexs,sandra_nz,3,Thu Jul 9 14:46:30 2015 UTC,Except that if I keep his car on my property I'm now responsible if anything were to happen to it.
AmItheAsshole,3coexs,UndergroundLurker,6,Thu Jul 9 15:07:47 2015 UTC,"Make him sign a contract specifically absolving you of any responsibility in case of a tow, or physical damage."
AmItheAsshole,3coexs,UndergroundLurker,4,Thu Jul 9 15:15:12 2015 UTC,"Think about if he wasn't your brother. Would you be putting up with his crap? Probably not. But, as his brother you still have a duty to do what you can to help him. That doesn't mean letting him sleep for free in your home, but take him to AA meetings if the drinking is a serious problem, help him find a home he can afford and at the very least talk to him, he sounds lonely."
AmItheAsshole,3cotzb,Pattyfactor,8,Thu Jul 9 16:04:00 2015 UTC,Yeah your dad was the asshole. Even though you were given the gift it seems like he should have taken responsibility of telling your aunt anyway being the he is your father and having the gift come from his sister.
AmItheAsshole,3cotzb,Funkingthefake,3,Thu Jul 9 17:05:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's an easy one.  He was the asshole."
AmItheAsshole,3cotzb,Diarygirl,2,Thu Jul 9 16:30:20 2015 UTC,"Yes, your dad's the asshole.  Parents teach you to always tell the truth, and then when you get older they tell you to lie for them.  He should have definitely not put you in that position of lying to your aunt.  To be fair, though, he may have panicked when your aunt (by the way, is it your mom or dad's sister?) texted you.  That's the thing about text.  It's a lot easier to lie because not only don't see you, they don't hear tones of voice that might give away lying.  And I don't think you're 96% responsible for remembering the game.  It's more like 50/50."

AmItheAsshole,3ck8gf,albertofranfruple,15,Wed Jul 8 15:44:18 2015 UTC,"Are you guys all missing the part ""I offered to pay her back when we broke up and she said not to worry about it."" where she deletes the debt by saying not to worry about it. From there on you don't have to worry about it. She cannot just change her mind afterwards (especially 3 years after). She is being an asshole by telling you that you don't have to pay back and then 3 years later suddenly talking to you as if you had been avoiding to pay her back."
AmItheAsshole,3ck8gf,ritsikas,2,Wed Jul 8 22:36:26 2015 UTC,"It wasn't in the original post. So yeah, everyone that initially responded did miss that part."
AmItheAsshole,3ck8gf,no_modest_bear,9,Thu Jul 9 13:00:25 2015 UTC,"What the fuck? No you aren't an asshole. She told you not to worry about it. You believed her. She went back on her word which makes her the asshole, not you."
AmItheAsshole,3ck8gf,Courier-6,17,Wed Jul 8 23:03:36 2015 UTC,"I don't know.  Not paying someone back is an asshole thing to do, but I can't imagine  most people getting dumped for their best friend saying, ""That bitch! I'd better repay that loan!""  Pay her back.  Don't do it for her, do it for you.  If it wasn't bothering you, you wouldn't be posting here.  Edit:  it's weird that opinion is going the other way on this one.  I mean,  on the one hand,  it's cool to disagree and we aren't  all sheep,  but I have a really hard time believing anyone here after being dumped,  cheated on and lied to would give a wet fuck about ninety clams.   Maybe *I'm * the asshole."
AmItheAsshole,3ck8gf,Funkingthefake,5,Wed Jul 8 16:18:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah but she said not to worry about the debt earlier, therefore she isn't remotely justified in demanding the money, and he isn't responsible at all for paying it back, regardless of their relationship status."
AmItheAsshole,3ck8gf,MeInDevelopment,2,Thu Jul 9 02:59:00 2015 UTC,Post was made before he disclosed that.
AmItheAsshole,3ck8gf,Funkingthefake,3,Thu Jul 9 03:11:03 2015 UTC,"Thanks mate. I was completely depressed and broken after we separated so I thought ""screw her, Cheap payment for what she put me through, don't owe her anything"" Years have passed and totally forgot about it, until she brought it up. I don't have $90 to pay back and I gain nothing out of paying her back now"
AmItheAsshole,3ck8gf,SynapticSight,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:31:01 2015 UTC,I don't have $90 to pay back and I gain nothing out of paying her back now    She told you not to worry about it before. Sounds like she changed her mind to try to get some free money. I'd vote don't pay her back.
AmItheAsshole,3ck8gf,no_modest_bear,0,Thu Jul 9 12:01:36 2015 UTC,"Have you missed what everyone has been telling you? Pay her back, don't justify it as payment for her cheating on you. A loan is a loan and you didn't even have to pay interest!"
AmItheAsshole,3ck8gf,lessdothisshit,-3,Wed Jul 8 16:42:55 2015 UTC,"I gain nothing from paying her back now.    As a debtee, it's got nothing to do with what you gain. It's either, pay her back, or recognize that yes, you ATA."
AmItheAsshole,3ck8gf,Lamenardo,5,Wed Jul 8 20:30:21 2015 UTC,"No. She forgave the debt. It's come up a few times on judge rinder - people break up, and then decide to try get money out of their ex. It's not a significant amount of money, and she forgave it. She is the asshole here."
AmItheAsshole,3ck8gf,Fudgms,5,Wed Jul 8 23:54:25 2015 UTC,"If she said don't worry about it, don't worry about it.  She made her decision then and there. Taking it back years later is a shitty thing to do."
AmItheAsshole,3ck8gf,MrDub72off,12,Thu Jul 9 05:24:29 2015 UTC,"I would gladly be the asshole fuck that chick. You can't call a debt forgotten, then demand it back 3 years later. She's the asshole, you were an asshole dating a 21 year old thinking it would work out."
AmItheAsshole,3ck8gf,MeInDevelopment,4,Wed Jul 8 23:15:07 2015 UTC,"Well that's a bit mean. If you love someone at the time, I don't think you're an asshole as long as you're both adults and it's consentual."
AmItheAsshole,3ck8gf,MeInDevelopment,4,Thu Jul 9 02:57:37 2015 UTC,"That's a pretty big assumption. I actually seriously doubt half 19 to 24 year olds go clubbing as much as one would think. There are too many different types of people to say that a majority would become a party animal at ages 19-23.  I have a brother mid twenties who used to go clubbing every night, but I also have a 20 year old brother who hates clubbing and prefers playing video games with his GF.  Pretty much, people are different yo."
AmItheAsshole,3ck8gf,callievic,2,Thu Jul 9 03:04:12 2015 UTC,"It can work. I met my SO at a bar when I was 21 and he was 28. (It was 5 pm on a Tuesday.) I told him on our second date that he was almost too old for me, and he said that he was going against his better judgement by dating a 21-year-old. That was almost two years ago, but we're both old people at heart. It's rare, but it can work.  That said, OP isn't the asshole in the situation. Adults don't forgive a $90 debt, only to bring it up three years later. (Though his ex's behavior shows that she wasn't particularly mature.)"
AmItheAsshole,3ck8gf,MuffinMan12347,5,Thu Jul 9 03:12:39 2015 UTC,"No, at the time she said you don't have to pay her back, you offered so you're obviously not an asshole.  She's an asshole for bringing it back up 3 FUCKING YEARS LATER!!!"
AmItheAsshole,3ck8gf,CodeErebus,9,Thu Jul 9 03:17:31 2015 UTC,"hold on people, how is he the asshole? He borrowed a small amount of money and before he got the chance she cheated on him. HE IS NOT the asshole here, she is. IF she had asked when everything fell apart and he didnt pay her back then, he would be the asshole."
AmItheAsshole,3ck8gf,Funkingthefake,3,Thu Jul 9 06:58:33 2015 UTC,Thankyou. We tried to be friends as we saw each other at university everyday. I offered to pay and clear the air but she said not to worry as we were uni students and had no money. Later found out she was dating my mate and thought screw it I'm not going to bother.
AmItheAsshole,3ck8gf,CodeErebus,9,Wed Jul 8 16:25:05 2015 UTC,That would have been important info to put in the original post.
AmItheAsshole,3ck8gf,Funkingthefake,4,Wed Jul 8 16:41:09 2015 UTC,"if she told you not to worry about it back then and that was 3 years ago then dont sweat it, its a small amount of money. Either pay her back or dont."
AmItheAsshole,3ck8gf,mustanggt90210,2,Wed Jul 8 17:00:50 2015 UTC,"Seriously, if she really refused payment when you broke up, then you need to edit your post."
AmItheAsshole,3ck8gf,mewfahsah,3,Wed Jul 8 16:51:05 2015 UTC,"Just by hearing that, you are not the asshole. She can't keep you on the hook, so to speak, for 3 years until she needs her money. She passed up the opportunity to be paid back, said don't worry, means you're good bro"
AmItheAsshole,3ck8gf,Popcom,3,Wed Jul 8 18:18:01 2015 UTC,"She told you to not worry about it, then THREE years later wants it? You can't change your mind like that so far down the road. Its $90 dollars, I'm sure she's made plenty more than that in the three years you've been apart."
AmItheAsshole,3ck8gf,MeInDevelopment,3,Wed Jul 8 17:56:26 2015 UTC,"No. You offered, she declined. End of story. If she wanted to she should have said so."
AmItheAsshole,3ck8gf,rcgy,3,Thu Jul 9 01:04:11 2015 UTC,"NO NO NO! Everyone is saying yes but for the love of god no!  Not based on her cheating on you at all.  Completely based on that she told you not to worry about it, therefore you are exempt from needing to pay her back.  Unless I read it wrong, regardless of how shitty of a human being she is, she told you not to worry about it, end of story."
AmItheAsshole,3ck8gf,_Gwink_,3,Thu Jul 9 02:09:35 2015 UTC,"Holy fuck guys am I taking crazy pills? If she said the debt was forgiven, it is forgiven. No, you aren't the asshole."
AmItheAsshole,3ck8gf,Howardval,7,Thu Jul 9 03:01:14 2015 UTC,"So, the way she looks at honesty and character is to cheat and lie, yet she asks you to uphold standards that she could not live up to, You are for sure not the asshole. But depending on how the relationship was and who in it held the heavier financial responsibility i would say your Karma is off the hook if you where the one in general picking up the bill. If not and if you care about showing who is the bigger person, i would pay her back."
AmItheAsshole,3ck8gf,Funkingthefake,10,Thu Jul 9 03:47:07 2015 UTC,"Yes you are the asshole.  Paying back a debt should not be conditional on unrelated matters such as ""only if you don't cheat on me""."
AmItheAsshole,3ck8gf,Fudgms,2,Wed Jul 8 16:59:49 2015 UTC,"Really?   He's the asshole?   I can see saying he's an ass for not paying a loan,  but he is arguably the least amount of asshole in the story."
AmItheAsshole,3ck8gf,Funkingthefake,3,Wed Jul 8 15:52:42 2015 UTC,Wasn't a loan. She said keep it. It was a gift.
AmItheAsshole,3ck8gf,90ne1,2,Wed Jul 8 19:28:03 2015 UTC,Exactly.
AmItheAsshole,3ck8gf,x0rms,1 point,Thu Jul 9 07:05:20 2015 UTC,"Well, he's an asshole. One of the two in this story."

AmItheAsshole,3ck8gf,SynapticSight,2,Thu Jul 9 03:31:55 2015 UTC,"But the debt was forgiven, he technically had no debt since she told him herself it wasn't a problem. So only one asshole."
AmItheAsshole,3ck8gf,Targren,1 point,Thu Jul 9 03:36:14 2015 UTC,"Paying back a debt   It's not a debt if she said ""don't pay me back"" years ago."
AmItheAsshole,3ck8gf,Subduction,8,Thu Jul 9 03:02:51 2015 UTC,"Yes. Paying back what you owe isn't about what kind of person the lender is, it's about what kind of person you are."
AmItheAsshole,3ck8gf,Courier-6,15,Thu Jul 9 12:02:55 2015 UTC,Yes.  Paying your debts is not contingent on the character of the person you owe.  If that were true no one would ever have to pay their bank.  Pay your debt.
AmItheAsshole,3ck8gf,Subduction,23,Wed Jul 8 15:54:20 2015 UTC,"Except she told him not to worry about it and waited THREE YEARS to bring it back up again. In what world is he an asshole? You can't tell someone something is okay to not do, and when they believe you call them an asshole when they don't do it. That would make the girlfriend an asshole."
AmItheAsshole,3ck8gf,Funkingthefake,-5,Wed Jul 8 15:50:42 2015 UTC,"Call me old fashioned, but you borrow money you pay it back. End of story.  If the money is, however, in an envelope and its your birthday or under a Christmas tree then you're off the hook, but otherwise you pay it back no matter what the other person says."
AmItheAsshole,3ck8gf,Subduction,11,Wed Jul 8 23:01:46 2015 UTC,"That's ridiculous.  If someone says a debt is forgiven, it's forgiven."
AmItheAsshole,3ck8gf,Funkingthefake,-2,Wed Jul 8 23:12:25 2015 UTC,"Like I say, I don't agree.  People can be guilted, harassed, or made to feel cheap for asking that debts be repaid, especially small debts like this one.  If somebody went out on a limb for you at a time of need then you don't even ask whether they want it repaid or even consider it being forgiven.  You repay it.  That's what somebody who borrows money does.  They repay the money.  If the lender then wants to take that repayment and put it in an envelope and give it back on their birthday or put it under a Christmas tree terrific, but you repay the money."
AmItheAsshole,3ck8gf,Subduction,6,Wed Jul 8 23:35:56 2015 UTC,"You're putting yourself out on a ledge.    Say I loaned you needed to sign something and I loaned you a pen.  You offered it back after you signed, and I said, ""Hey, you keep it."" Then I see you there months later and say, ""Hey, you still owe me that pen."" You're honestly saying I wouldn't be the asshole?"
AmItheAsshole,3ck8gf,Funkingthefake,-8,Wed Jul 8 23:41:55 2015 UTC,"Sorry, but a pen is not $90, handing something to someone and telling them to keep it is not a loan, this analogy isn't really analogous at all."
AmItheAsshole,3ck8gf,Subduction,7,Wed Jul 8 23:46:04 2015 UTC,"It's completely analogous, it just makes your argument look obtuse."
AmItheAsshole,3ck8gf,Funkingthefake,-4,Wed Jul 8 23:51:25 2015 UTC,"You haven't described a loan at all.  Handing someone a pen worth fifty cents, or absolutely nothing if they got it at the bank, and telling them to keep it isn't remotely like loaning someone $90 cash for repayment at a future date.  They are nothing alike."
AmItheAsshole,3ck8gf,FatGuyANALLIttlecoat,4,Wed Jul 8 23:52:57 2015 UTC,I disagree. A loan is a loan.
AmItheAsshole,3ck8gf,Subduction,7,Wed Jul 8 23:58:08 2015 UTC,"""Hey, I got that ninety bucks you loaned me. Here.""  ""Don't worry about it.""  ""No man, that's too much. Here.""  ""Don't worry about it.""  ""Really? That's a lot.""  ""Just buy me a few beers and we're even.""  If someone forgives your loan, it's forgiven. Sincere attempts must be made, but if someone says you're square, you're square."
AmItheAsshole,3ck8gf,Mulsanne,-2,Thu Jul 9 00:00:40 2015 UTC,"Terrific, but that's not my values, especially for $90 bucks.  I'm repaying the loan. In cash, in beers, in dinner, whatever, but $90 in value is going back to them."
AmItheAsshole,3ck8gf,snuffyboots,16,Thu Jul 9 02:12:04 2015 UTC,"The only caveat is just that she said it was cool back in the day but now it's not cool?  If you give someone a pass on oweing you,  you can't back up on it."
AmItheAsshole,3ck8gf,TheGuyInTheVest,2,Thu Jul 9 02:44:05 2015 UTC,"Honestly, if she didn't need it, she wouldn't be asking.  Do I think you should pay it back?  No.  But if you have it, and you can spare it, give her back her $90.  I don't think you're an asshole, though, either way.  Having been ""the girl"" in this situation before, she's probably just fishing.  For an amount less than $100, she can eat it.  Cost of doing business."
AmItheAsshole,3ck8gf,mattempirelic,2,Wed Jul 8 22:34:17 2015 UTC,"Honestly who cares deeply about 90$, I'd give it to her as you're going to be seeing each other a fair amount at these parties no doubt.  Small price to pay to never hear the topic again. But yeah if she said not to when you offered you're not the asshole."
AmItheAsshole,3ck8gf,Not_a_Zaku,4,Wed Jul 8 17:11:15 2015 UTC,"If she's been cheating on him for months then she's been stealing from him every time he has taken her out, bought her dinner, gifts anything like that.  So I don't think repayment is necessary in this case."
AmItheAsshole,3ck8gf,whalemango,2,Thu Jul 9 10:53:33 2015 UTC,"No, you aren't.  I'm sure money changed hands plenty of times in that relationship, if she wants to get hung up on this one occurrence that's on her.  You don't loan money to family, friends, and loved ones; its a gift."
AmItheAsshole,3ck8gf,MeInDevelopment,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:09:42 2015 UTC,Not if it's given with the expressed expectation of payback.

It might not be that she's not into you but keeping her shield up for a number of reasons.  5 months is longer than casual but not really long enough to be permanent.  You may need to slow down to her speed.  But yea ask her how she feels about what you said but she's not obligated to do or say anything in any given amount of time.

AmItheAsshole,3cgmii,NoBetterNameIdea,20,Tue Jul 7 19:27:26 2015 UTC,"You are not the asshole. You want to enjoy a sports game with your dad. No one can fault you for not inviting anyone else with you, since it's a moment you want to have with your father.  That said, I feel that the comments about how much money you spend on your brothers and how much they spend on you are irrelevant to you being an asshole in this situation. But you might want to consider spending less on them if the disparity in amounts spent is bothering you."
AmItheAsshole,3cgmii,fifthpilgrim,11,Tue Jul 7 19:35:47 2015 UTC,"Not an asshole, but a couple things to keep in mind:   I do go out of my way to get them, and their families, as much as I can for the holidays and their birthdays, but I never see anywhere near the same amount from them.   You said it yourself. They have wives and children, and they will always be the priority over you, by necessity. They cannot, and will not, reciprocate in the same degree. Consider, for instance, you give a brother a $300 sport's ticket. Should he choose to reciprocate, his gift will have to be of similar value. Now consider his wife and children. Any gifts to them would have to be of that same value, or higher, if we are giving gifts in the traditional sense; those whom we love get more. Now your brother's spreading the wealth too thin, and things like bills suffer. It's just not practical. So, instead, he gives you what he can, which will likely be less.   Second is that they'll say yes, but not be able to afford it at which point I'll feel bad and end up paying for tickets for all of us (myself, my dad, and my brothers)   While I commend your desire to give gifts to your family members, you shouldn't feel guilty for having more money than them. You chose a different lifestyle over them, one which results in having more free cash. This doesn't obligate you to them in any way whatsoever. Feel free to invite them, and if they cannot go, then so be it. However, it would be rude to invite them to an event which they have no chance of affording. Say, a $500 per person cruise on two week's notice.   It can be very awkward having family members of different incomes, but only if you make it so."
AmItheAsshole,3cgmii,missshrimptoast,2,Tue Jul 7 22:26:51 2015 UTC,"I second this. All the adults exchange gifts in my family and I am the only one with kids (only grandkids on both sides and only great grandkids on my side). People love to spoil my kids and can go overboard (even when I beg them not to). If I spent what they all did I would be bankrupt. I do for people throughout the year and show my appreciation, but I can't do all things all the time."
AmItheAsshole,3cgmii,Viperbunny,3,Wed Jul 8 04:24:16 2015 UTC,"Thank you for adding to this. It can be rather uncomfortable, being the ""poor"" person being showered with gifts by the ""rich"". It's difficult to say anything without sounding ungrateful."
AmItheAsshole,3cgmii,missshrimptoast,2,Wed Jul 8 23:17:56 2015 UTC,"Not the asshole about the game, but a little bit assholish about the gifts.  You are choosing to give them very (ridiculously) generous gifts, and then judging them by your standards on the return gifts.   It might be making them uncomfortable, honestly.  Back off on the holiday gifts if they can't reciprocate in kind, even if you WANT TO and CAN give more."

Aside from one brother who hasn't responded, I contacted them and have things organized. No compromises made and I am not paying for everyone. As suggested, I have been limiting my habit of paying for everyone for a few months now (I realized I had begun to resent the situation a while ago) and it hasn't seemed to matter one way or the other, so this wasn't too big an issue.

Obviously there are some families that don't talk about it at all, but I think you may be assuming that they may not know where you're coming from.  As for the rest of it, if they do try to tag along, make sure they understand that you want to do this as a nice gesture, and they can come along if they'd like, but seats are up to them, and you're gonna be sitting down in front with your dad."

If they want to but tickets and come along you welcome the company, but that you will not be changing your seats because you are sitting where you are for the experience. If they push you explain that you just can't afford to pay for everyone at this time. The plans have already been made and beyond them deciding to purchase their own tickets, you are sticking to it. You don't have to be rude, but stick to your guns. Best of luck and enjoy the game."

Could I suggest you stop paying for things for your brothers? That really only works when the payment is done freely with no expectation of reciprocation. The fact that you are mentally tallying up the amount of money you spend on them versus the money they spend on you tells me that you have an expectation of reciprocation. All that's going to happen is that you are going to feel resentful and angry at them - but completely due to your own actions, not theirs!"

As a side note unrelated to assholery, if there were still toothpaste stains, it wasn't cleaned properly."
AmItheAsshole,3cj80f,dgwingert,12,Wed Jul 8 11:43:51 2015 UTC,"While I'm definitely not a fan of the whole tactic of just shouting louder and louder that a lot of parents use, the bit that caught my eye was you talking about your words meaning something/being respected. You responded to her shouting by shouting back. Why would she respect your words if this is how you act? I'm assuming that you don't respect her actions, so she has no reason to respect yours.  Respect isn't earned through age. 19 is nothing. It's not like once you turn 18 you suddenly get all the respect in the world. You're still a young adult living with their mother. There's nothing wrong with that, but it doesn't really command much respect. It's just the norm for someone your age. You have to earn respect. Your mother respects you as a person by letting you live in her house, but nobody is entitled to any respect beyond that basic level.   She shouldn't have shouted like that. I hate it when anyone does that (and trust me, this behaviour doesn't end when you move out). But the way to respond to it is not to try to outmatch it. You shoulda just cleaned the damn sink. The reason you shouted was because you felt disrespected. The reason that she shouted is because you weren't showing her respect. It's a 2 way street.   the stains left by toothpaste for whatever reason must not have come off with water   Then you didn't clean it. If someone tells you to clean a sink you don't just run water over it, and if that's what you did do then it's just making me wonder further why you're trying to demand extra respect. If the toothpaste stains were there then you didn't clean the sink.  For me to call someone an asshole, they have to do something genuinely malicious. And I don't think that you did that. So I won't call you an asshole. I'll call you entitled and spoiled, though."

You either didn't do it at all, or you did a shitty job and didn't do everything. You should've just cleaned it right the first time. And yelling at her to tell her she was disrespectful? Please tell me you understand how stupid that is. How can you demand respect while being completely disrespectful yourself? You are an asshole, and a pretty immature one at that. You live in your mothers home. You don't yell at her, especially to lecture her. She shouldn't have yelled at you either, but still. You can move out if you have such a problem with her.    Also, you being 19 means literally nothing. It just makes you sound like you think you're entitled to respect, which isn't how it works."

They aren't duty bound to you in this regard.   At the same time, I can completely see why you're upset. I'd feel really angry in this situation. It seems like social rejection and ostracism on Ash's part. Is there a story we're not getting here? I mean, you two were obviously good friends at one point, but something must have happened to be in this current situation.   I've been in this exact position before, by the way. I felt angry and did petty things like this in retaliation. The problem is that it's obviously not a healthy adult way of dealing with these issues.

You can tell him if you feel it is the right thing to do. He may get angry with you and accuse you of having feeling for her. It can hurt not to have feeling reciprocated and sometimes people lash out.  What confuses me is why you think it is so strange for him to ask this girl out and to be his girlfriend when they have just met. That's pretty common. It's not like he is asking her to marry him. He is asking her out to get to know her and wants to start a relationship with her because she seems like the kind of girl he is interested in. That is completely normal and healthy. While friendship is a good basis to start a relationship, but you can date and still have the closeness of friends.   I have a policy of staying other people's relationships unless it is information that poses a risk to the other person and cheating (although that can be a sticky situation too).

AmItheAsshole,3c9lm8,TheRealFakeSteve,20,Mon Jul 6 04:13:18 2015 UTC,Not the asshole. People park where it's legal to park. Maybe a tad inconsiderate but you did nothing wrong. Mr. Note could have been just as inconvienced by a sequence of other cars parking there. If anything it's stupid to leave your car parked on some strange street for 4 days but it doesn't make you an asshole any more than parking anywhere else does. The occupant of that house is entitled and everyone in this thread seems to have chip on their shoulder about parking/have never lived in a city.
AmItheAsshole,3c9lm8,DrProbably,2,Mon Jul 6 11:51:41 2015 UTC,Yeah I was a little dumb leaving it in a strange street...
AmItheAsshole,3c9lm8,Eggshellblue,41,Mon Jul 6 13:04:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah you're the asshole. I think you would have been fine if it was for like, an hour. But you were parked there for three days. Which is an extremely long time to be taking up space in front of someone else's house.  edit: added a word.  Plus I just noticed, he doesn't have a driveway. So that's basically the place where his car goes. I don't know much about areas like that and the legality of parking, but that basically seems like he could have been in the right to have you towed.  edit two: I would also like to point out that we aren't arguing the legality of what he did. Maybe it wasn't illegal, but just because you can do something doesn't mean you should. I'm all for parking there for a little bit, but leaving your car there for three days is a little much. This wasn't even just a day. It was the entire weekend."

It was a dick move I guess (though really no different than parking in any other public use parking area, home owner doesn't own the street) but the home owner couldn't have gotten it towed.  It's one of those things where you're completely within your legal rights to do it, but by doing it you're going to make people so angry they may be willing to break laws (damage you or your shit).... Like taking pictures of strangers in public without permission, completely legal, yet likely to end up with smashed teeth and camera"

AmItheAsshole,3c9lm8,Funkingthefake,19,Mon Jul 6 09:06:11 2015 UTC,"I was surprised reading through these comments too, I guess it's a matter of what the local laws say, but where I'm from, if there aren't any parking restrictions, you don't have any more right to the spot in front of your house than anyone else.   If you've got loads of bricks coming, or whatever, you can apply for a permit to have that space reserved for a period of time and if you're super-keen to always have a the same spot, you buy a place with parking."

I realize in hindsight I should have said nothing at all, but I was honestly just talking about the stupid beauty standards these films usually adhere to, not her personally.

So why is she still insulted?  About being autistic, honestly I don't know. Sometimes it is like I'm talking in an entirely different language then everyone else. I've had a situation before where one second I'm in a completely normal conversation among friends and the next one girl is so insulted she demands me to leave because she misunderstood something I said.  So usually I just don't bother talking at all, because by the time I can figure out how something I say will be taken, I'm usually under the shower already.  My family are really the only people who I thought I was close enough with that I can just say whatever pops into my fucking retarded excuse for a brain without having to worry.

Well, on one hand, she didn't catch your meaning, you didn't MEAN to insult anyone.   On the other hand, rule of thumb is that the communicator is responsible for making sure they're understood by the recipient of said communication.    If you're constantly being misunderstood, it's not (necessarily) because people are dumb or overly sensitive, it's because you don't know how to communicate right.   You are far from the only person with this problem, but flip it around sometimes, you'll see that the failure COULD be considered on the part of the listener, it can also (and for practical purposes, should) be considered a failure on your part to predict how your words will be understood.   I'm actually very good at not offending people, but I often have trouble getting my message across in other arenas.  Being understood is a subtle and tricky art sometimes.

I wish I knew the answer.  I would say get the police involved, but that could be even more traumatic for the child.  I never hit my children, but the grocery store was always stressful.  I remember one time when my oldest was about 3, he kept asking for cookies.  I kept trying to explain that we had other snacks and I was not buying cookies.  Well, after about the 20th time, I ended up screaming ""I told you we're not getting cookies.""  Well, the looks I got made me feel an inch tall, but those other people missed my patient explaining.  Maybe this kid kept acting up and the dad just freaked.  Or maybe it wasn't the dad at all but a stepdad or mom's boyfriend."

That is one I consider a big no-no, and if it had been addressed several times without spanking and the message was still not getting through, then a spanking is going to happen.   The alternative punishment is time out, which is an age based time limit during which the child is not addressed or looked at (watching them for safety but surreptitiously) and my kid screams the whole time. People would talk shit (self-absorbed bitch, deal with your kid) and bitch at me (say ""you wanna deal with that"", ""somebody's upset, mommy"" and dirty looks because nobody wants to hear that shit) if I did this in public because a) he is crying unconsoled, b) he is crying and bothering everybody else.

That said, it is not clear on the severity of the spanking, both on what you received as a child and the one you had just witness.  So assuming that it wasn't really serious since people were simply walking by (I believe (or hope) that there would be some reaction if an act of child abuse was done in public.), the spanking was within reason and fitting to the context that you did not seen prior to the father coming out from the corner.    You ain't an asshole, just overly concerned. Most parents dislike being lectured or questioned when disciplining their child."
AmItheAsshole,3c7ohu,YvonnePewPew,1 point,Sun Jul 5 18:13:41 2015 UTC,"Physical punishment does not necessarily means violence. For me, the physical punishment I got when I was little was slapping my hand and when I was really misbehaving, light caning. I was too young to understand what was wrong with my actions in words and that kind of punishment was enough of a deterrent to do it again. Parents do have to distinguish what is violence and what is acceptable use of force of course. It shouldn't be used once the child is old enough to have cognitive understanding of the misdeed.  Again, people are jumping into the perception that physical punishment is violence. Parenting is not plain and simple."
AmItheAsshole,3c7ohu,YvonnePewPew,0,Mon Jul 6 03:02:40 2015 UTC,"A single child is not a model or representation of every child out there. Granted, some children do not require physical punishment to be discipline and you do have a lovely child. That said,it does not void the notion that physical punishment is a valid tool of discipline. Region culture and environment do play a part here and we should not condemn physical punishment as violence. What matters at hand is the nature of said punishment and the context. A light slap at the hand of a child when he/she commit a undesirable act is not heinous."
AmItheAsshole,3c7ohu,YvonnePewPew,0,Mon Jul 6 04:29:04 2015 UTC,"Being ""ok to control other people with physical aggression"" is not the lesson that is taught when physical punishment is used sparingly. Again, you are over exaggerating this form of discipline. Kids are indeed smarter than what most adults would give them credit for which is why some parents still use physical punishment despite the child being old enough to have a cognitive process relating to the wrong of their misdeeds which I do not support."
AmItheAsshole,3c7ohu,YvonnePewPew,0,Mon Jul 6 11:32:52 2015 UTC,"There is no evidence to suggests that and a magnitude of individuals in this functioning society who has grown up experiencing a stern hand in their childhood development can attest to it. I see here that you are still adamant that physical punishment should not be used at all and since both of our stance on the matter isn't likely to change without devolving into a senseless argument as seen in your use of personal snide remarks, there is no longer a point to continue this discussion further."
AmItheAsshole,3c7ohu,YvonnePewPew,0,Mon Jul 6 17:10:29 2015 UTC,"Also, violence is the intention to hurt/damage someone with physical force but when a parent is using physical punishment as a tool of disciplining the child, the intention is to educate and deter the child from committing the act again, thus not violence. We should not aggravate nor exaggerate the act into something entirely different due to difference in the way we handle certain situations."
AmItheAsshole,3c7ohu,YvonnePewPew,12,Mon Jul 6 17:29:57 2015 UTC,"Well, I personally am a believer of physical punishment as discipline tools,   A ""believer""? Like a religion or something? or do you have evidence [not just anecdotes] that it is helpful at all? In the last few years data has been gathered that shows:   While conducting the meta-analysis, which included 62 years of collected data, Gershoff looked for associations between parental use of corporal punishment and 11 child behaviors and experiences, including several in childhood (immediate compliance, moral internalization, quality of relationship with parent, and physical abuse from that parent), three in both childhood and adulthood (mental health, aggression, and criminal or antisocial behavior) and one in adulthood alone (abuse of own children or spouse). Gershoff found ""strong associations"" between corporal punishment and all eleven child behaviors and experiences. Ten of the associations were negative such as with increased child aggression and antisocial behavior. The single desirable association was between corporal punishment and increased immediate compliance on the part of the child... The meta-analysis also demonstrates that the frequency and severity of the corporal punishment matters. The more often or more harshly a child was hit, the more likely they are to be aggressive or to have mental health problems. http://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/2002/06/spanking.aspx  ""Until researchers, clinicians, and parents can definitively demonstrate the presence of positive effects of corporal punishment, including effectiveness in halting future misbehavior, not just the absence of negative effects, we as psychologists can not responsibly recommend its use,"" Gershoff writes.  ibid.   Therefore the OP was 100% right in commenting on this poor child's life and the abuse that the parents were dishing out. Whether it was wise to say anything depends on the context. If the OP was in physical danger [from the violence-prone parents] then it is better just to surreptitiously video it or to walk away.   To add to that, even animal behaviorists do not recommend physical punishment http://avsabonline.org/uploads/position_statements/Punishment_Position_Statement-download_-_10-6-14.pdf If it is not OK for animals, how can it be ok for children?"
AmItheAsshole,3c7ohu,dogGirl666,5,Mon Jul 6 18:38:35 2015 UTC,"Therefore the OP was 100% right   We have way too little information available to say that. That study was just a meta-analysis of 88 different (unnamed) studies. Each will have measured different things with different end goals, and different levels of care taken to get a representative sample. For such a complex issue, one meta-study is not enough to say anything with the certainty that you are saying it.  There are so many different types of corporal punishment, and I do not believe that they would all yield the same result.  Also, you don't only punish children because it helps their development. Sometimes parents get mad and it is the only way to shut the kid up."
AmItheAsshole,3c7ohu,modernbenoni,2,Mon Jul 6 18:53:00 2015 UTC,"Yup! I find that there's a difference between spanking and physical abuse. Although the study may be accurate, I think so many people use it as proof without thinking about the different levels of corporal punishment.

When I first stated that I believe in physical punishment, it does not mean that I find violence and child abuse acceptable but merely stating that I find it as a valid form of disciplining an unruly child (When necessary).   It's also why I also said that I am assuming the punishment was done within reason and the context of disciplining the child and not senseless beating.

AmItheAsshole,3c7ohu,modernbenoni,2,Sun Jul 5 22:38:37 2015 UTC,"Animals and children ain't the same.  There is not enough information in original post on the severity of the spanking to justify your deductions.   Studies on the topic are not clear evidence of what they claim, often using words like ""Likely"" and ""could link to"" which means assumptions. There is a broad spectrum of what is the acceptable level of physical punishments in the world, so your idea of physical punishment that you think I am condoning could actually count as child abuse to me.   Yes I used the word believer as I felt that it was most appropriate to use said word to convey what I think about the subject matter. You being irate at the mere use of that word with this topic seem to suggest that you are very sensitive about this issue.   And finally no, I am not going to purposefully find sources and data since this is merely a subreddit that I use on my leisure time."
AmItheAsshole,3c7ohu,YvonnePewPew,2,Mon Jul 6 04:36:27 2015 UTC,"I'm not irate at the word ""believer"" I was just asking what you meant, literally.  Yes animals and children are not the same, but I tend to assume children should be treated with more discernment and care than animals. Humans and animals are not so far apart that an effect on a species somewhat closely related to humans [a mammal, dogs] would not be similar to what would happen in people. Unless of course you are a creationist and assume that people are a separate creation so far apart that you would never see a relation between behavior in one and the other. I have seen that some of the worst child abusers are creationists so, it could be logical to assume that you do justify ""spanking"" because of what you have read in the Bible. BTW, if you are into the Bible, in the verse about not sparing the ""rod"" is not about hitting a child with a ""rod"" http://www.hcna.us/columns/childabuse.html ; the rod is what a shepherd uses to guide sheep, not hit them. You might be familiar with the verse that says:  ""Thy rod and thy staff comfort me..."" Psalm  A thing that is used to hit me would not comfort me at all, just saying.  http://www.scripturezealot.com/2008/03/15/psalm-23-your-rod-and-your-staff-they-comfort-me/     The OP already said that he does not mind some physical punishment, he was pointing out that this was beyond what he was used to as far as harshness. I was not really singling you out to attack you,  I post these links every time I see someone supporting spanking because I assume that people need to be aware of this new information. I guess you would prefer me to make this info a top level comment rather than a reply to you personally.   I want trust between children and their parents to be increased because the more a child feels insecure and/or has mental illness, the more crime and antisocial behavior crops up in society. Crime and antisocial behavior also costs the taxpayer money."
AmItheAsshole,3c7ohu,dogGirl666,1 point,Sun Jul 5 22:40:37 2015 UTC,"I thought it was always best to report the parents because a stranger saying something can anger the parents even more in cases with extreme physical abuse?  Also, within the first sentence of the link you provided, it states that punishment should not be used as first-line or early use treatment - not that it cannot be used at all. The article states that physical punishment should be used sparingly, not necessarily not at all."
AmItheAsshole,3c7ohu,Syc4more,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:15:25 2015 UTC,"I was hoping that the link could be a starting point rather than a definitive statement on spanking. For example, a quick related Google search finds this:   In a randomized controlled trial of an intervention designed to reduce difficult child behaviours... physical punishment has a direct causal effect on externalizing behaviour, whether through a reflexive response to pain, modeling or coercive family processes.   http://www.cmaj.ca/content/184/12/1373.short  Randomized controlled studies are pretty much the gold standard for scientific research.  That link has many links to further information on spanking."

I don't have an issue with spanking, per se  (I was spanked as a child - even got ""the belt"" when my parents deemed it worthy).  I dunno.  I just sort of felt that, in this particular circumstance, that Dad went a little too far.  Also, I guess I felt somewhat ""responsible"" for his discipline since it came after his gag with me.  In retrospect, maybe I stepped over the line a bit by saying something but, again, I feel the need to stress that this was one helluva whoopin'!!  A quick couple of taps to the butt and I wouldn't have batted an eye.  I mean, this guy really let him have it.  Maybe the kid has discipline issues.

It sounds like her opinion is that people should marry because they love each other, not because of anything else. That doesn't sound terribly ground-breaking, political, or anything to start an argument over. Isn't that what's been trending all over the US lately, #lovewins? I'm kinda confused what exactly was the shit you called her out on."

She also sits there and talks about it being wrong that people don't recognize gay marriage saying they should be able to get married if they want and people should accept that. Which I agree with, but if your going to argue for equality it needs to be equal, not just towards your own prejudices. On the tumblr page they were mostly before she was with him, but some posts were after that, but it was things like naked pictures, her asking for naked pictures, a couple with her mid sex with someone that most definitely wasn't him, although I believe those ones were before they were together but I'm not completely sure. Also yes I do care about that friend which is why rather than argue with her, and inevitably him, I blocked them because I wasn't going to put up with her threats anymore, and I already saw it was heading to me having to fuck him up if I didn't.

I don't think you were the asshole over the argument necessarily, but I think blocking your friend as well was a step too far. It's certainly doable to be friends with someone, but not their partner. I'm more concerned about why you have kept naked pictures of someone who is supposed to be your friend, and is also engaged to another of your friends.

And Voat is the only real alternative available right now...  But I thought Voat was even more against censorship that Reddit?  How is it a safe space??  It just makes zero sense.  Anyway, my verdict is that the other poster started out being the asshole.

I'm completely honest when I tell you I don't think you should ever be in a position of judgement since you think it's just fine for someone to crosspost conversation from someone, and not OK for the person to come and defend themselves.   This means I don't think you should be supervising people, be a cop, sit on a jury, etc.   This existence of this subsite is another example of gross hypocrisy on Reddit. At least with other Reddit sites, years of bad things happening has mods making rules about blacking out identifying information, my username isn't blacked out in my trolls imaging of our conversation/debate.  I suppose you think Reddit subsites should stop blacking out Facebook or Twitter names when people are posting conversations from there here on Reddit, since you think this post is just fine?"

Two different types of assholery, although Brutsch would also pull race cards if it suited him. I saw him do that when arguing with Jews around the time Cast Lead was going on.   As usually went with him, that argument instigated him starting another subreddit as a troll, many of his subs started in that fashion.

This is the part where you realize the internet is no joke, it's a primary source of QUALITY information as well as disinformation.   It's not all bad, but it's certainly not all good. It was supposed to reign in the age of information, but it turned out to bring in the age of disinformation.    That's one of the reasons people advocate for a place where discussion and debate is free from moderation, so bullshit can be challenged. A place where dissent isn't moderated out. You can get that shit on Facebook groups, the model that Reddit strives for.   For example just about every charlatan has a Facebook site, and they're heavily moderated, they have to be. They're basically shill sites. That's the model that Reddit is shooting for, a site where the primary focus is on the subsites, the creators of them, and the moderators. The commentors will have to be sheep, otherwise they'll get moderated out.   https://www.facebook.com/thefoodbabe"

Imagine this, you get called a pederass racist misogynist cis white scum by an SRSer, but instead of them being able to tag you with insulting flair, troll you for a few min, ban you, then troll you through mod mail, you're actually able to have a debate with the SRSer.   And that'd be about the end of SRS. That's how shit gets worked out, not moderating mods is how shit becomes a shitstorm. A lot of Redditors yearn for a site where mods are forced to follow strict rules with regards to ethics and morality in moderation of online debate and discussion.   They don't get to use mod features to fuck with the userbase, or they're banned. Hopefully Voat's going to set those standards and enforce them, because Reddit never has."

Allowing users to create their own venue of discussion within the site about any topic and how they see fit so long as it does not break reddit's general rules?"

The real question is why someone feels the need to police gifts and get personally invested in other people's affairs instead of worrying about their own lives - which makes me think it's a form of avoidance. Nervous and anxious personalities project their insecurities onto others because they believe that's just how everybody sees the world.

The whole thing with Victoria is weird and shitty, but nobody knows what's going on, and I'm sure there's confidentiality issues at play here.  As far as blacking out subs, I kind of understand why r/iama did it, because without Victoria, the sub can't logistically operate without Victoria, but as a protest, it's flawed because by closing the subs, it removes powerful voices.  The mods of r/iama can reach nine million people with a couple of keystrokes; how many can they get to without their own community?

AmItheAsshole,3c58ah,SpastixFantastix,3,Sun Jul 5 00:09:56 2015 UTC,It's like that story about students in some university protesting against the university police because someone got tased. Protest happened one day after the incident. The school then as a response organized an event where they can talk about taking policies of the police but only 15 people showed up. The event was four weeks after the incident which apparently was good amount of time for the protesters to learn that the student who got tased pretty much wanted to get tased so he could get his 15 minutes of fame and write a good angry article. He was a journalist student.   Of course I'm not saying that this is easily comparable situation but it does teach us to learn more about situations before standing our side. I'm sad that Victoria got fired because she seemed like an important part of r/iama but other than that I don't yet have much opinion since I really don't know much more.

The problem must be clearly stated and backed up with evidence. And the demands made by the protest must be clear and it must be possible to verify that they are met. Time to communicate with those who will be affected would be nice too, especially when that is one of their grievances toward the admins.  If the protest meets these criteria I would be happy to join.   So, no, I don't think you are the asshole.

This whole thing is bizarre - as an active redditor of 2 years, none of the actions of the admins have upset me. The mods' actions just do not reflect the experience of the average redditor. I think part of this must be continuing after-effects of the backlash against banning /r/fatpeoplehate - ie: just puerile nonsense - there's nothing wrong with reddit and there's nothing wrong with a private company making its own management decisions such as dismissing employees and banning certain hate speech on their site. The mods and the ""activist"" users of reddit are overestimating their own importance and influence - they're not shareholders or managers or directors at reddit - they're just customers.

Are you the asshole from not stopping him from ruining his life?  No.  You don't have that power.  The rub with mental illness is that the only person that can help him is him.  You can't force pills into his mouth, you can't send him to therapy.  Those are things he needs to do.  You can tell him he needs help, you can tell him if he doesn't change his self destructive behavior you can't be a part of his life anymore, but past that, you can't.  On the other hand, you don't sound like a particularly awesome friend, either.  Friends don't call friends ""borderline retarded."""

Mental illness, or a severe sense of disillusionment with the world, or unresolved abuse issues, something like that. A well-adjusted, secure, contented human being does not drop all his friends and family like so much trash and run off to find themselves.  I agree with you that this will almost certainly fail. He'll be more lost than before, hurt, and alone. I don't believe there's much you can do to prevent this. However, I think what you can do is maintain contact with him to the best of your ability so that, when this lifestyle does crumble down around him, he has a support system to (hopefully) lift him back up again.   Sad truth is, many people need to hit rock bottom to realize they need help, and doing so can be dangerous. Some people don't come back up. I hope your friend isn't one of these.   Best of luck.

I dont generally make comments on nosleep however.  I understood her resentment and anger towards her husband, but why did she kill her kids? I guess that could be viewed as tactless because there was no discernable reasoning behind her actions though she seemed completely self-aware. I cringed a bit because it felt like it was thrown in just to add to the shock factor.  But no you are not an asshole. Even if something is gratuitous violence, it's a work of art and you are free to express yourself as you see fit.

In the end, she thinks it's better to kill them because they've suffered so much.  The youngest is already dying from neglect.  In this way, in her twisted mind, they will be happy.  I worried a lot over the execution of this story.  It was quite short and somewhat choppy, a little experiment with some new style that I've been doing.

Kind of a ""from the monster's perspective"".  (Not to dictate to you what your stories mean, either-- I hate that whole idea-- but perhaps there's an angle there to work off of in the future.)

For a long time after I was raped it took me right back to that place to read about rape in stories and I needed to stay away from that in order to move on from it. But I still loved horror and was very thankful to people who put trigger warnings for rape on stories.   Tags are there to help people who are grieving. Obviously you don't have to tag every single obscenity but the big ones like abuse, self harm, rape, ect. are ones that are worth while to put a tag on. If it plays a big part in the story and you don't want to spoil it, put it on one of those spoiler tags so people who have no concerns don't get spoiled."

I'm honestly glad nothing truly horrifying has ever happened to you, but people who were scarred are not pussies just because some sick monster thought it'd be fun to hurt them. The horror genre is amazing and I love feeling terrified by what I am watching or reading, but traumatizing experiences can give you a form of PTSD. That's why trigger warnings are there. They are not for you because you don't need them and I'm very glad you don't need them, but some people need to stay away from certain topics and that is perfectly fine. If you were a child abuse victim or ended up in a hospital because a significant other wanted to hurt you, then I wouldn't expect you to give up horror completely if you wanted to stay away from those two minuscule topics in horror."

Tags are handy though, for example, if I see something tagged 'Animal Abuse' I usually don't click. I just can't handle it. So yeah, you aren't an asshole for writing the stories, but if you write another story with child abuse in it, and make a conscious decision not to tag it as such, that would make you an asshole.   And that person who told you you are a terrible writer was breaking the subreddit rules anyway, because in /nosleep, you're just recounting real stories. I've seen a few people complain they just want ghost stories, basically, not human monster stories. Perhaps because it's so much easier to believe the human monster stories, whereas those who don't believe in ghosts and demons often enjoy the pretence, like a fairy tale."

AmItheAsshole,3c35mb,Abelithea,5,Sat Jul 4 17:57:20 2015 UTC,"She's obviously going through a lot. This is difficult to deal with for anybody. It's especially difficult with trials and tribulations of being a teenager. She's searching for ways to help her feel more normal (whatever that means to her). It's a difficult and lonely place to be, and she probably sees you as a source of stability. It's a terrible struggle. Most people probably cannot relate to how difficult this is to deal with (myself included).  You, being the wonderful person that you are, are troubled by this. One the one hand, you want to do what you can to help her and be there for her. On the other hand, you have to look out for yourself and your own wellbeing as well.  You are not the asshole here. Neither is she. You have to remember to take care of yourself first. You don't owe her anything."
AmItheAsshole,3c35mb,OhMyTruth,0,Sat Jul 4 15:20:29 2015 UTC,"Okay, so I'm not a psychologist, but your friend may have borderline personality disorder.  Regardless, since you know she's a nympho, who's to say that if you can't satisfy her needs that she won't cheat on you to take care of it?  I realize I'm being cruel, but honestly I think you should let this one go.  Or at least hold off dating until you guys have grown up some and she's had some time to be stable.  I think you should really think about whether she meant that she wants to date you because she needs the stability of you, or if she really wants you the way you want her.  I think it's very likely that she's worried that if she doesn't dangle sex in front of you (which is the only way she truly knows will get her male attention) you might go away when she needs you most.  If she really wanted you as anything other than a security blanket, I think she would have come to you first and you would already BE dating.  Anyway, I hope you don't take this personally.  I'm assuming a lot here.  But if you read this and, in context, any of it seems like it might make sense, use your best judgement and try VERY GENTLY to talk to her about it.  Please don't accuse her of stringing you along, she probably has extremely low self esteem and she will take even the most minor rejection personally, especially if you are her lifeline.  Also, if she won't get help herself (assuming you do want to try to be there for her), I think that you should consider seeing a therapist yourself, to help make sure you walk the line very carefully.  Or you could sleep with her and have everything be awkward for a while and you could look back and regret that night you both got drunk and she convinced you to play strip games.  Those are the two most likely scenarios for me.  EDIT: oh, and no, you're not an asshole.  Neither of you are assholes.  I just don't think that it's going to work out between the two of you, LTR-wise."
AmItheAsshole,3c35mb,snuffyboots,-1,Sat Jul 4 14:59:05 2015 UTC,"You made out the assumption that you were in some form of exclusive relationship based on no other information besides that fact she was intensely in love with you.  I mean that doesn't make you an asshole, that's most of your teenage relationship problems. Given the context, you didn't really have any other choice, I'd have done the same.  I'm not entirely sure if she's the asshole, either, oddly enough. She's obviously been depressed enough to be checked into a mental health institute, and sex gives a rush of endorphins.  I would act as emotionally reserved as I could if I were you, and talk to her about your feelings, her feelings, and set up relationship limits. Sex isn't an inherent part of a relationship, it's supposed to be a celebration of the other.  Love is a case of the right person at the right time, as harsh as it seems"

As an observer, I'm tempted to isolate the particular reactions you have made and call them overreactions, particularly if Bethany doesn't have a history of violence and/or wasn't just released from prison.  But regardless of if it's a ""credible threat"" or not, no one has any business threatening violence against anyone in or out of the workplace as a result of awkward social interactions.  She's the asshole, and you can be forgiven for a lot of overreaction, given that she's already crossed the crazy line."
AmItheAsshole,3bzjxq,charliebeanz,3,Fri Jul 3 13:19:35 2015 UTC,"You aren't overreacting. She is breaking the rules and she doesn't want to get found out. She is mad because you know what she is doing. The threats are so you won't say anything and get her in trouble. She is immature and escalating it. You do need to make your management know about it because it can come back to bite you. She can claim you are the one harassing her and such. Getting it on the record that she is threatening you is important. It is harassment and it needs to stop. I would talk to your union again and make it very clear that this is a serious issue, that you is creating a hostel work environment and you shouldn't need to be looking over your shoulder at work. If they give you shit I would also remind them that treating this as if it is nothing because it is a woman harassing you is a problem and that if they are not going to take it seriously you will be filing a complaint. I would follow through with that. I know it is expensive, but you can sit down with a lawyer and talk about your options. I think for a few hundred dollars you can have a lawyer write a letter that if the harassment doesn't stop you will be taking legal action. This is usually enough to stop things and if it isn't then you know you have a more serious problem on hand.  Also, keep a paper trail. Talk to your boss, talk to the union rep, make you communicate in emails or if you don't you have a log of who you talked to, when, and what the conversation is about. You will need it to protect yourself.  You are not the asshole. If they allow her to keep doing this they are wrong. She should be fired. This is a clear case of someone who is immature and potentially violent."
AmItheAsshole,3bzjxq,Viperbunny,2,Fri Jul 3 15:01:19 2015 UTC,"Thanks /u/viperbunny.  I have an email in to my shop steward, but they are all out today (july 4th celebrated holiday on July 3rd this year) so I will speak more with them about it, I'm sure, on Monday.  I'll be honest, it makes me a little nervous to think that she could be fired about this, but she definitely makes me uncomfortable and I am not the only one that she has threatened or had altercations with at work.  I didn't go into more of the personal history between the two of us, but she's really not a nice person... she still doesn't deserve to lose her job.  Eh, I'm torn.  I'll be glad when it becomes a union issue and out of my hands, so to speak.  Edit: my union rules prohibit me bringing this to my supervisor or manager's attention, because until the union decides it's necessary to involve them, it's tattling.  What I DON'T want to have happen is that I get in trouble for all of this.  I just don't want her coming over to my cubicle and messing with my stuff.  I'm not sure if she's the sort of person who would do that, but it gives me the creeps, thinking about it.  Guess it's time to start locking up my stuff..."

I actually think you're both assholes. When you shouted ""(I don't) want to have anything to do with that"" you put your girlfriend in an uncomfortable position. You basically made her choose sides then and there. You dragged her into your personal drama. That's definitely an asshole move."
AmItheAsshole,3bzjxq,dogGirl666,2,Fri Jul 3 20:16:40 2015 UTC,"Yes, I am also a woman.  And that's why my GF let me know that I sometimes make her uncomfortable for what I say.  I apologized to her (my girlfriend, I mean).  It frustrates me sometimes because we all work together here, and sometimes I wish that my GF would have my back when it's someone that she knows I have cause to dislike or avoid.  Like, she shouldn't need to choose sides.  My GF isn't friends with Bethany, she just knows her in passing.  Bethany, however, knows that my GF and I are dating and probably purposefully held her back to talk while I walked ahead.  I regret that my girlfriend was involved in this situation at all, and the truth is that if she hadn't been there, Bethany wouldn't have come up to me directly to say anything to me, and it wouldn't have happened.  I can't even describe the derision I have for Bethany, but I really feel like my GF should have been on my side for this.  Am I wrong?"

A woman and her daughter came in the store, and I while I was doing my thing, I saw the daughter stuff handfuls of gum in her pockets, then made eye contact with her.  Mom and daughter come up to the register, mom pays for her shit, and as they start to walk off (technically it's not shoplifting until they pass the point of sale), I ask the daughter if she's going to pay for all that gum.  Mom turns to the daughter and says ""You'd better not have anything in your pockets!!!"". Sure as shit, daughter has like $10-$15 in gum stuffed in her coat. I called the cops while mom beat her daughter's ass.  Was I the asshole? Naw. The person breaking the law was the asshole."

AmItheAsshole,3byv69,whosthisguythinkheis,1 point,Sun Jul 5 03:40:33 2015 UTC,"Because cheating is something that only pathetic scumfucks do, and by enabling the pathetic scumfuck you are complicit.

AmItheAsshole,3byv69,Tyriofax,1 point,Sun Jul 5 07:34:59 2015 UTC,"see the way i see it is that when someone actually attempts to cheat in a relationship they have already done the damage.   what happens later doesn't matter it doesn't compound the pain any more. would anyone really care if their partner were attempting to cheat but they couldn't, the same thing happened to the relationship irrelevant of whether the cheater actually did cheat.   so if the enabler is not responsible for any additional pain why are they being an asshole when their actions are essentially irrelevant, the damage was already done when the option to fuck/kiss/cheat came up surely?"

Otherwise your just perpetuating the situation. And I actually do think that the longer it goes on without the other person knowing they are being cheated on, the worse it gets. Because every minute you aren't just telling them that your out of the relationship, is time they are wasting in the relationship. So, as I said, being complicit in the act whilst at the same time taking no action to inform the person is scummy.  Honestly the mechanics of how all this works are a bit new to me, seeing as how I wouldn't tolerate this situation to begin with. It's amusing to contemplate though."

It's hard with huge outbursts like this, because it makes assholes like Chris dig their heels in. They start to feel like you're the one who's unreasonable, and when confronted with the shit they've done to you, they double down.

Chris sounds like he was being a douche, and I could almost be on your side, except you're not mad about the cigarette, you're mad he isn't a good friend.  You didn't confront him about all of these other things that he's done that obviously hurt your feelings;  you have an overreaction about something which deep down you probably don't give a shit about. So while to you, it feels like another jab of the knife, to him it feels like you've gone mad.    Is Chris an asshole? Probably.  He doesn't seem like a great friend, and maybe a user of people.

Communicating why you were removing yourself from the situation to everyone would have left everyone recognizing that Chris was the asshole.

On the very emotionally charged topic of feminism, people can grow angry quickly, and their ability to discuss the topic rationally may devolve. This does not, however, invalidate the claim.   I should point out that, when citing sources in favour of feminism, there are often few studies that can be created to properly judge society's effect on a woman's overall experience. For instance, how would one create a study which accurately gauges how often a women is drowned out in a conversation with men? Or,from what age and from how many men is a woman viewed as a sexual object in day-to-day life? In my experience, this happens frequently, but attempting to map these phenomena ethically, accurately, and consistently, would be nigh impossible. However, these are still realities of being a woman.  I don't think you're an asshole.

When people start hitting you with comparisons to some ignorant cabal that is already convicted in their minds (in this case MRAs and Daily Mail), you can take this as a guarantee that they are not even trying to hear or understand any point you are making.  As soon as the sibling got the idea that you dared to say anything that wasn't blind and complete support for whatever social cause was on the table, she wrote you off as being as much of a bigot as the direct enemies and most ignorant commenters of that cause.  It is shameful, but this is the reason so much discussion is divisive these days.  Hardliners cannot stand to discuss any factual nuance of the issue, or hear anything other than blind, unflinching support for their issue, without assuming on the other party all of the worst assumed sins of their greatest enemies.  So you can't even suggest an accurate understanding of the facts without being called Hitler.   All that being said, unless you're under 16, you should know better than to expect any kind of high level or even productive political discussion on Facebook.  I'll have to agree with Funk that you share some of the asshole burden just starting the discussion there.

As long as you live with her rent-free this is going to continue.  You love your mother but would like to have a real future with perhaps a career or gainful employment of some kind, maybe even do something you love.  She has a bleak future to look forward to.  Money would soften and smooth that a bit, but her trajectory is not going to change.  Your grandfather took a look at the situation and placed a bet on the future - YOU.  You are an asshole, but not for the reasons you think.  You are behaving like a child.  You need to grow up and realize that adults routinely have to make difficult decisions filled with conflict.  You're 19.  It's time to become an adult.  As an adult, you have several options:   Move out.  All your expenses are your own but you won't be bothered with this behavior. Make a deal with your Mom to pay rent, share utilities, whatever.  She's clearly financially disadvantaged, plus she resents that you received money when she feels she is more in need.  This was the grandfather's choice, and it's not a bad one, but you are the one who has to deal with the consequences, not him. Give up the inheritance to your mother and continue the way things were before you inherited, but expect your family to piss the whole chunk away in no time.  The behavior will stop - for a little while.  It will of course return when the money runs out, but hopefully by then you will be earning enough money to get to #1 or #2.  The inheritance is off the table.   Option #1 gets you fully clear, but at reduced inheritance due to the expenses.  However, if you can do this at a lower cost then #2, there's no reason to stick around.  #2 gets you partially clear but you must goal-tend your inheritance because they're never going to stop trying to nibble away pieces of it - after all, she feels entitled and is uninterested in YOUR future, but hers looms uncertain and painful.  #3 is essentially full surrender.  Don't do it unless there's a gun to your head."

Besides, the way you describe your mother's mannerisms makes it sound like she's refusing to acknowledge that your side of the argument has merit, which it does, and any parent worth their salt should realize that this is an opportunity to help teach their freshly minted adult teenager how to construct a budget for an adult life."

If they feel that you should be contributing to the finances while you are living there they need to have that discussion with you and let you know their expectations.  They should not be bringing that up every time they ask you to run an errand for them.  Otherwise it is going to get real muddy as to what exactly you are contributing.

There are actual minors dropping out of school and picking up shitty jobs to help take care of their families, and to me, you just seem so ungrateful. You have a duty to contribute to the household. Don't be a mooch. Mooches are assholes. Just pick up the milk and eggs, and let it go.   That said, I don't believe she should feel entitles to your college education funds either, and I truly feel sorry if she seems to think its okay for you to get into life-long student loan debt, because she thinks she was gypped out of an inheritance.  No one wins here."
AmItheAsshole,3borhw,DudeWheresMyRhino,0,Wed Jul 1 17:40:06 2015 UTC,"So none of the top comments are going to acknowledge how wildly inappropriate your moms behavior over an inheritance is? Technically, your grandpa gave her a gift. Your college is paid for. If not in full, he saved her money. I can't believe she's angry that her parent left her child something great, that she benefits from as well. I don't think you're the asshole, but I see what the general consensus is here. Realistically, your mom should be reimbursing you for hers, but making you buy yours. I don't know what all this rent/utilities talk is about, because it's completely normal to live with your parents while in college at 19, without them expecting money from you. You should be supporting yourself. Fun/clothing/gas/insurance/phone bill. But at 25 hours a week, I doubt you even make 1000 a month. You wouldn't be able to afford to live alone unless you had roommates, and I think your mom is being incredibly petty. She's the asshole. It would be wise to look for full time work, and get out. You'll have to pay for everything, but you sure won't feel obligated to lend money you won't get back."
AmItheAsshole,3borhw,xtrasneakygastro,-4,Wed Jul 1 12:57:21 2015 UTC,"Nah you aren't an asshole, and you aren't wrong, but this isn't going to be easy. Your best bet may be telling a few white lies. Unfortunately, I doubt your mom is going to see your side, even though you are right. But you are stuck with this situation since you live there. I think the best solution is to tell a white lie, and although you are happy to run the errand, you don't have any money at the moment, so you will need to be given the money to pay beforehand. I don't know about your financial situation, but if that is a realistic white lie, then just do that and avoid the heartache of arguing with someone that has a fundamental difference in their understanding of what is appropriate."

He is allowed to hang out with whoever he wants to, since it is his life, but if his girlfriend has directly expressed that she is uncomfortable with him hanging out with his exes, and he still continues to do it without having a discussion with her about the situation, he is an asshole.  Edit - your friend really should sit down and have a conversation with his girlfriend about this"
AmItheAsshole,3bp3i2,fifthpilgrim,6,Wed Jul 1 02:19:17 2015 UTC,"Sounds like hes honest about it to his girlfriend. However he is a bit of an asshole for not being more considerate of his girlfriends feelings. If I was in that situation and my gf was hanging out with exes I would hate it too. I know all to well what hanging out with an ex can lead to, you can be the nicest guy in the world but as soon as certain feelings come to play anything can happen."
AmItheAsshole,3bp3i2,LugNuggets,4,Wed Jul 1 02:22:23 2015 UTC,"I can't really say because I don't know all the information based off this post, but I wouldn't be OK with it. My ex and I dated 4 years ago, and remained great friends -zero hookups since the break up- and his new girlfriend asked him to cut me off. He did, for two weeks, then started messaging me again. I love him, but I respect him enough to not cause any tension in his new relationship so I have not responded to him once since the initial conversation about it. Having a close friend who is an ex doesn't seem unreasonable, but being in contact with all of his ex's seems a bit odd to me.  That emotional connection ex's have with each other would be unsettling for anyone I think. He should respect that, unless she controls other parts of his life or friendships, then they have real trust issues."

So she is an asshole for not wanting him to see his exes (unless she is cool with in general, but is upset about them meeting somewhere private). And you are an asshole for implying that he should meet his exes, but not tell his girlfriend about it.    ...hes kind of an asshole for...telling his current girl about seeing or talking to his exes."

If I'm going to be honest, it seems like a red flag to me that she needs space.  To put it in perspective, I went to visit my mother, whom I see once a year or less, and I still called my husband every day or every second day during that time period. It wasn't rude at all; when you visit someone, there are times when you all kind do your own thing, read a big, go to the mall, whatever, and that's when you can contact your SO.  Not the asshole, but I might bring this up with her. Good luck.  EDIT: Should add that when my husband and I talked, it was for like five minutes to say, ""Hey, how're the cats, work, you, good, love you, bye"". A long drawn-out conversation would probably be considered rude."
AmItheAsshole,3bp6jp,missshrimptoast,6,Wed Jul 1 02:11:24 2015 UTC,"The thing is that she is spending 16 or so hours each day with only her family, and is sleeping or on the bus the other time.

Good table manners dictate that when another person asks for you to pass something (salt and pepper, a napkin, the potatoes, etc) you pass it to them.

I can see why he'd be annoyed by you being a pain in the ass rather than just handing him a napkin, but once you pointed out the nearby option, he decided to make himself the bigger pain in the ass just so he can feel like he won the conflict.  Even if he has it in his head that he's teaching his son some lesson, the only lesson he imparted is that his son's dad has an attitude problem."
AmItheAsshole,3bo487,flignir,2,Tue Jun 30 20:13:20 2015 UTC,Most likely your dad is the asshole but it also depends on your tone. That wouldn't be an excuse for his behaviour but you would also have a part in this.

However, the fact that this is about business cards makes this into a unique situation. If this was about any standard product, you could just cancel the order without being an asshole, but since this is a highly personalized product, you cannot cancel the order without being an asshole and forcing the company to throw out the business cards you ordered.  So basically, either you drive out to that store and pay for the business cards and not be an asshole, or you refuse to pay for the cards you ordered and be an asshole. Whether or not you're an asshole is up to you in this situation."
AmItheAsshole,3bp1ie,fifthpilgrim,2,Wed Jul 1 02:24:18 2015 UTC,"So, I just checked out the Staples.com website and I don't quite see what you're seeing. There are options for delivery only which accept credit-card payment and take 3-7 business days, and options for same-day service which requires pick-up and payment at the store.  Are you saying you confused the two, or is there another option I'm not seeing here?"
AmItheAsshole,3bp1ie,missshrimptoast,1 point,Wed Jul 1 02:18:55 2015 UTC,"Here's my assumption, because I'm almost certain I clicked on delivery, but I must have hit same-day? It never asked for my credit card info, so I assumed I had to pay when it arrived. Needed a signature and all.  I was also on my lunch break and tried to rush this out asap, so I was hungry, too. That's not an excuse, just more details.  The only real reason I assume I'm an asshole is because I called four hours later after I got done with work, and they were all printed out ready to go."
AmItheAsshole,3bp1ie,missshrimptoast,5,Wed Jul 1 02:40:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah in that case it's totally your fault. Pay upon arrival is more or less dead for anything other than take-out food for a variety of reasons, namely that most corporations use third-party shipping companies for their deliveries, and asking them to take payments creates a whole dimension of security and LP issues.  You should have checked and made sure you had your info right. It can be very frustrating to rush out an order for a customer, only to have to throw it out, wasting time and money, because the customer couldn't be bothered to check their info. The excuse ""I was really busy"" also doesn't fly, because we're all really busy.  I know you didn't intend to, but you're the asshole."

Depression is a really tricky thing to try to work through, and some relationships don't survive it.  The most you can do is just make your position known.  My own personal advice would be to A) find a new best friend for the time being, assume that your current one can't handle your problems on top of her own and B) to try to be there for her if and when she tries to come back into the fold.  What you should NOT do is push her too hard.  Let her know that you're here for her if she needs it, but otherwise you're not an asshole.  You just need to know that she may never be the same, and you may never be as close as you once were."

You're not really an asshole in this situation, since you were honestly trying to help your friend and do whatever you can to make them happy, but pushing someone to talk about something that they don't necessarily want to talk about isn't all that great.

What's assholish about all this is you being unnecessarily confrontational about her beliefs. It sounds like she's just a hippy-dippy type of person and you had a big problem with that. Why not just call it a night and leave amicably? It feels like you were being confrontational for no reason, like, you had to be right, you know?

In the month or so I've been hanging out here, he's posted about leaving his girlfriend of three years because she lied to him about who she hooked up with before they met, then a week later, he had been in a relationship with this radical feminist who demanded an open relationship, and threw a fit when he hooked up with someone else, then a few days later posted that he only dated virgins because they were so easy to control and manipulate (can't find that, he deleted it because of the massive downvotes) and now this, which reads like a pretty contrived scenario.

So I'm putting the actual negligence aside and only thinking about the choice to cover his ass.   There are two real questions here...  Question A - Were you the asshole back then?: OP, when you were fourteen, I'm sure you didn't know whether or not the vet had some magic cure for being left in a hot car too long (they don't).  BUT, you couldn't know that, so you get major asshole points for not saying what you did as soon as possible, because them knowing exactly what was wrong immediately might have made enough difference to give him a chance.  The only reason to make up a story was to save yourself, even if it made things worse for the dog.  So...asshole.  Question B - Are you still an asshole for not coming clean years later?:  This depends on who suffers what consequences.  Coming clean now would probably be more traumatic for your cousin than you, but if there are ongoing consequences, you really owe it to them to speak up.  For example, if your cousin is now afraid to make a move without protecting his dogs from whatever freak unknown imaginary threat he thinks killed this dog, you've got to set him straight.  If he hasn't gotten another dog since because they're too hard to care for, you owe him the truth.  If he's moved on and has a new dog and is happy, I think you're ok to let him be. I was still really broken up about my first dog dying of cancer even two years after the fact, and I didn't need anyone reopening that wound with any revelations.  But you owe him one giant, life-altering favor someday, like getting his first born a great job, or giving him a kidney if needed.  On this question, maybe not the asshole."

Sometimes it really isn't the best thing to come clean. It may be good for you, to forgive yourself and to relieve yourself of a burden. To the injured party, however, you may be forcing them to relive events they're simply not able to handle, plus the added pain of knowing your caused their agony."

He happens to be wrong about what cruelty means, but I think it's believable that this was negligence, not malice.  Look what he says...it seems like he knows it's a big deal.   To be fair it wasn't animal cruelty.  Cruelty implies intention which I had none of. I realize it's not an excuse and I still feel horrible but to imply that it was intentional is off target. On a side note I was about fourteen at the time and the dog was small and quiet and in the back seat so it was a pretty easy mistake...

Were they all trapped somewhere or was it like 110 degrees where you were?  Anyway, you should have told them, but what's done is done.  Telling them now would serve no purpose.

AmItheAsshole,3blb7n,omararod,10,Tue Jun 30 19:09:14 2015 UTC,Cruelty is defined as callous indifference or pleasure in causing harm.  That you're still brushing it off like it ain't no thang makes you look pretty damned indifferent.
AmItheAsshole,3blb7n,Funkingthefake,4,Tue Jun 30 19:51:12 2015 UTC,"It's kind of an esoteric point to argue, but ""cruelty"" when used with respect to animals is often a catch-all term for any offense that harms them that is expressly prohibited or punishable by local law.  Depending on where you live, that may have been a criminally punishable form of animal cruelty.   Example:   While not all states have laws that address animals in parked vehicles, numerous local ordinances prohibit this, and more may be enacted... Even with out a state or local law, this action could still constitute cruelty under some circumstances.  In fact, in the Texas case of Lopez v. State , the defendant left his dog in his car on a hot day to go and watch a movie in a theater.  He was ultimately convicted under the state's anti-cruelty law.  Notably, Texas does not have a statute that specifically addresses dogs left in parked vehicles.  Below is a table that describes these laws by outlining the major concerns within the laws.   from https://www.animallaw.info/topic/table-state-laws-protect-animals-left-parked-vehicles  No one suspected Texas movie guy of intending to hurt his dog.  But he was convicted of cruelty."

I worked a job as a hospital sitter (untrained staff that sits with certain patients and makes sure they don't hurt themselves or run away) and it was basically the only way they scheduled, but it was because sitters are only brought in when they're needed. It was clearly explained in the job description and the training, though, I knew to expect it. That was the only way to work, though, they call you whenever and ask if you can come in like an hour. Made making plans a bitch.  So there are definitely exceptions. OP's job isn't one of them, though."

AmItheAsshole,3bju2r,Ontheneedles,2,Tue Jun 30 01:56:02 2015 UTC,"How did you get that job?   I was actually looking for a job as a CNA (certified nurse aide, it's actually a licensed position that mainly boiled down to changing adult diapers, awfully underpaid and underappreciated job that I'm glad I don't do any more) but most of the workers were just college kids (and other kids fresh out of high school) looking for a job. IIRC it was a home healthcare agency running it, and they just put an ad on craigslist (no idea what section the unlicensed sitter job was under, maybe healthcare where the CNA/HHA ad was). I ended up doing it because that's where they had openings. It paid like $9 an hour for an 8 hour shift.   What were the requirements?   Requirements seemed pretty minimal, probably just a high school diploma, although I was an easy candidate because I had CNA certification (takes like 2 months to get) even though I didn't end up doing any actual CNA work. There was a few-day-long orientation with some easy tests, a physical and drug test, and some vague medical background helps (even like taking care of an elderly relative) but plenty of people seemed like they had no background doing that stuff.   Are you absolutely required to go in when they call?   Nope, they were totally fine with it, they'd just call another sitter they had (and there were a bunch, I didn't ever meet most of them).   That was actually the big reason I ended up looking for another job was because I had too much trouble dealing with not having a regular schedule, I never wanted to go in when they called me and they were fine until I stopped being consistent about the monthly busywork inservice packets they had us do.  Honestly, it wasn't a great job. It sounded great, but it was really fucking boring after you got over the initial thrill of getting paid to sit on your ass. If you had a good patient, they slept most of the night and you just read or went on your phone or even a laptop if the nurses were cool, some weren't and you technically weren't allowed to do anything but sit and watch them. Still, passing the time was fucking brutal and the shifts were the longest-feeling 8-hour workdays I've ever had.  TL:DR - Any high-school grad can get it, saw it on craigslist. And no, they would just call someone else if you didn't want to work."

Suppose, instead of homosexuality, the issue was drunkenness.  Suppose according to my religion, drunkenness is a sin. I don't drink.  I have friends and relatives that do.  I don't hate them, I don't think they're all assholes.  I just think they're doing something bad.  They know not to invite me to parties with alcohol, and I know not to judge them for what they do (because they don't share my religious beliefs, so why would I expect them to care about my judgment anyway?!).  Some people, however, despite the fact I never tell anyone else not to drink, don't want to be my friend because they FEEL judged.  They care about drinking so much, that just knowing I don't respect it as a moral choice makes them incapable of tolerating my presence.  Even if I've never said a word to them, never looked at them askance.  Which is fine, everyone can choose their own friends.  But I don't think such people are necessarily operating out of any moral high ground.  Basically, she has a belief that an ACTION is immoral (homosexual sex) but that doesn't preclude her from being friends with people that practice it.  You have a belief that a BELIEF is immoral (non-acceptance of homosexuality) and that DOES preclude you being friends with people that believe that.  I'm not seeing that she's the asshole and you're lily white, here.   I couldn't see how I could be friends with someone that prejudiced.    She's not being prejudiced.  She's judging people on their actions.  Not pre-judging them.  Just like saying drunkenness is a sin, or lying, or adultery, or any number of things.  You don't AGREE with her judgment, and since everyone agrees ""prejudice"" is bad, you would like her belief to be classified as ""prejudice.""  But where's the ""pre"" part of prejudice here?  In fact, she's capable of being friends with people that she thinks behave immorally.  That doesn't seem that prejudiced to me.  If you can't handle that you have incompatible belief systems, then go ahead and end the friendship.  That's your right, and you're not an asshole for not wanting to be friends with someone whose beliefs make you angry.  But that doesn't mean she is the asshole.  And it doesn't mean you get to treat her like she is (""You're an asshole because your moral framework is different that mine!"")"

It's one thing to tolerate beliefs you don't agree with when they don't have any effect on you (like a casual friend not believing in evolution, which I imagine doesn't have a huge effect on your life).

Especially since (and I'm not saying this is the case with you but it's something to consider) most of the guys really didn't fall for me. Not me as a person. They fell for how comfortable they felt around me, how I made them feel, and my appearance. Inevitably, I would become more comfortable and behave more like my real self, and I would get comments like, ""You're not the person I thought you were.""  No. Clearly not. Because you were in love with an illusion, not a human being. And it's really frustrating. And it happens to most girls many times in their lives.

AmItheAsshole,3bke0f,Abelithea,2,Wed Jul 1 03:00:59 2015 UTC,"Sorry to but in -tips tophat-  Coming from a guy that got divorced from a 10 year relationship, what helped me the most was good friends, gaming, and just going and doing things to make me have fun and realize that I could live without her.  /u/missshrimptoast gave excellent advice as well :)  PS:Myself and my ex-wife are still good friends, my girlfriend and her hangout a lot as well. After the hurt goes away see if you want her as a friend. Some women make 10x better friends than lovers. just saying haha"
AmItheAsshole,3bivbx,LoneStarCub15,11,Mon Jun 29 16:18:38 2015 UTC,"Maybe like, 1/10th asshole?  Point blank lying is a little crappy, to tell the truth.  But, time off is as important as work, and most people don't appreciate that,so I can see why you did. Next time, keep it vague. ""I have prior commitments"" or ""I've made important plans."" Those give you the same voice without lying.    Edit: Clarity."

I had to do a couple large projects, study, and work (where I couldn't do any schoolwork) so I was constantly stressed out because I had so much shit to do with little time to do it and didn't have any time off for like two weeks.  I was literally shitting blood from the stress. Time off is important."
AmItheAsshole,3bivbx,Fudgms,4,Mon Jun 29 19:40:03 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry, maybe I wasn't clear.  Needing time off is necessary, and I wasn't implying otherwise. The lying is what's a little crappy."

AmItheAsshole,3bi5dv,BoboTheTalkingClown,19,Mon Jun 29 18:09:15 2015 UTC,"Best case scenario, I think you slightly over reacted, even though the guy is totally in the wrong. Worst case scenario, yeah you were kind of a jerk. If the guy genuinely did think it was hilariois, yeah that's a totally dickish thing and you wouldn't be out of line for saying something. But immediately going off on him like you did seems kind of uncalled for. You didn't have to start off as confrontational as you did. Besides, I don't know this person, but sometimes people have awkard spur of the moment reactions to unexpected things. In the video the guy going full rag doll was fairly unexpected. It wasn't funny at all considering the context and the fact that the guy could be seriously hurt. But sometimes the part of your brain that reacts to physical slapstick style stuff reacts and produces laugh faster than you can consciously realize ""oh yeah that's police brutality and that guy could be really hurt."" But this is giving the benefit of the doubt to this guy, and I don't know the context of the situation or this person at all."
AmItheAsshole,3bi5dv,thecoletrane,3,Mon Jun 29 13:34:14 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the whole awkward, spur of the moment thing seemed pretty possible, but it was the clapping. I'd have an easier time giving him the benefit of the doubt if it was just a snort, but the clapping seemed like genuine applause."
AmItheAsshole,3bi5dv,kidamy,9,Mon Jun 29 13:42:24 2015 UTC,"I'm a little confused.  The pic linked on ""seriously hurt"" doesn't appear to be the same guy.  Is that just an example?  To be honest, I think the guy in the video would have been hurt even worse than the guy in the pic (possible serious head trauma, for example).  I don't think you're the asshole at all.  If people aren't called out for being insensitive dicks, they won't learn.  He can say ""I didn't mean it like that"" all he wants, but seeing another human being thrown around like a rag doll is never funny.  In a movie, maybe, but not on the news."
AmItheAsshole,3bi5dv,JalorGotShadowbanned,3,Mon Jun 29 13:02:24 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the pic linked on ""seriously hurt"" is an example of what I feared had happened to the Turk. It's not a picture of the Turk, just a guy who got a face-full of water-cannon."

You could have gotten your point across with a simple ""you think that's funny?"" And given him a chance to explain himself. This could have led to a discussipn where his perception on gays and police brutality could have matured. But instead you became cultural commissar, equated a kneejerk chuckle to supporting seggregation, and damaged your own reputation. That guy did not deserve that.   (Not disagreeing with your opinion, just your handling of the situation)"
AmItheAsshole,3bi5dv,ChurchBrimmer,2,Mon Jun 29 19:39:06 2015 UTC,"I wish I could have just asked, ""do you think that's funny?"" (which is why I approached him later). I did let my temper get the best of me, which is rare, but I guess if I only get mad at people for literally applauding police brutality it could be worse.  Thanks for being one of the few people willing to offer up the opinion that I am the asshole.  Edit: I honestly don't think I alienated him, if the looks I got were any hint. If anything I alienated myself by outing myself as a sensitive, gay-loving, Damn Yankee in front of a boat half full of bayou boys. If that makes any difference."

However given the circumstances in the video I can see why you'd be upset and I probably wouldn't laugh at the video and clapping (what it seemed upset you the most) is a bit inappropriate. Also considering you did go back and explain yourself calmly afterwords you're not an asshole and neither is this person (probably) but you might have overreacted a smidge, but I can understand both points."

I don't know if that type of stuff happens in  your industry, but that could be what he was trying to do. With that being said i think the guys intentions were not to laugh at gay civilians getting hosed down. But more to maybe try and fit in a little more or lighten the mood.

Obviously you wanted to protect your girlfriend, but did you go to far?  I say you did go to far, but I think it's because you probably don't have a lot of experience with this kind of thing.  You went from waving your hair at her to throwin' bows.  That's a pretty aggressive move.  Hindsight is 20/20, but there are more defensive moves to take, at least before an aggressive move. Are you an asshole? Honestly, I can't say.  Those things move fast, and i wasn't there.  What I can say you are is lucky.  If things had gone a little differently, and say, she leaned into it and broke her nose, and security came and saw you looking a ok and her covered in blood, you wouldn't be looking like the good guy.

AmItheAsshole,3bh9ep,Trentonjohnso10,7,Mon Jun 29 05:15:40 2015 UTC,"While I'm sympathetic, I say yes you were the asshole. I would, however, like clarification: Did you give her a reason you didn't want to kiss her (that you are having personal questions of your sexuality)? Or did you just say simply that you didn't want to? There is a huge difference in these actions. If your girlfriend/boyfriend of seven months suddenly says they don't want to kiss you without any sort of explanation, how would you feel? If you did tell her that you are going through some things, she still has the right to feel upset over it, but at least she'd know the reasoning.  Overall, you led her on. You say you may have ruined your friendship, but you told her that what you had between the two of you was more than friendship. If you didn't want to date her, then don't. But it's not fair to use her as an excuse. If you don't feel comfortable with coming out, then that's fine... you don't have to. And I understand dating at first to see if ""maybe you really do like girls... or maybe you do like girls and boys"", but from what you said directly:    ""I went along with it because I was uncomfortable with coming out"".    That implies you knew, but still led her on anyway to avoid suspicion. So, you knowingly used her. If you know now that you aren't attracted to her, then you should end it."
AmItheAsshole,3bh9ep,TheGreenBasket,2,Mon Jun 29 10:37:41 2015 UTC,"No i don't think you not kissing her was being an asshole. But i do think you using her as a cover up of your sexuality is kind of assholeish.   Because if you go in the girls shoes she is thinking that this guy really liked her, and the day that you do come out (because you eventually will) she will probably know that you were just using her to save yourself.  Now i am not gay, but if i was and i was trying to hide it i probably would have used a cover up girlfriend to. And that's what a lot of people who are questioning their sexuality do. So in my opinion you are kind of an asshole in this one"
AmItheAsshole,3bg4j7,jagerl,13,Sun Jun 28 22:43:35 2015 UTC,"So your solution to this problem is to create an ultimatum, which she does not know about, which involves something as intimate and personal as sex, and then break up with her if your needs aren't fulfilled?  Yeah. Asshole. Try communicating with her using your words like an adult. Sex for women can be inutterably complex and tainted with past experiences from predatory men, and for you to assume she should have sex with you in your time frame without even asking her or speaking about it shows you're entitled as hell.   Talk. To. Her. First."
AmItheAsshole,3bg4j7,missshrimptoast,3,Sun Jun 28 23:36:32 2015 UTC,Exactly. You don't even know that she's only with you for status reasons - that's just insecurity talking. Only by having a heart-to-heart with her could you know something like that.

AmItheAsshole,3beovs,ronniejean1,6,Sun Jun 28 15:50:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's very shady. Dating a friend's ex is risky, you defintely need to wait a respectful amount of time to let everyone involved get over it, and if it's a friendship you care about, you should talk to your friend about it. You're not the asshole, your friend is."

This subreddit is about finding out if you're the bad guy in your own story.   Yes, his post is in the right place, but down in the comments we started diving into speculation about his best friend and I think he should go hash it out with the people involved because middling over things with me is not going to take him far."
AmItheAsshole,3beovs,Ravka90,2,Sun Jun 28 20:14:38 2015 UTC,"Im going to be honest, i haven't talked to this guy since it happened (about a year ago) so i was never going to go try to fix anything with him because at this point he is already well and truly removed from my life, this post was more for my conscience, i thought i had done the right thing but was beginning to doubt myself"

AmItheAsshole,3bgmv0,Abelithea,10,Mon Jun 29 01:44:28 2015 UTC,"Alright so basically you're being childish, neither of you are ready for sex yet, and you're not ready for a relationship if you think it's meaningless without sex.  In the end though, your reasons to break up are your reasons. Not an asshole."
AmItheAsshole,3bgmv0,ClintHammer,0,Mon Jun 29 01:44:20 2015 UTC,I think it's a little preachy of you to tell OP whether or not he's ready for sex
AmItheAsshole,3bgmv0,Abelithea,6,Mon Jun 29 02:40:45 2015 UTC,"Alright, let's drag in the law instead. 15 is below the age everywhere but Japan I believe so in the end he's not ready because it's also illegal."
AmItheAsshole,3bgmv0,ClintHammer,0,Mon Jun 29 02:52:39 2015 UTC,"That's the age of consent for sex with an adult.    Also he's almost 16 meaning in about half of the states he could legally have sex with a practiced adult, so that isn't really helping your case that he's too young for experimenting with someone his own age"
AmItheAsshole,3bgmv0,Abelithea,5,Mon Jun 29 02:58:23 2015 UTC,"You're the type to downvote people you argue with aren't you?  I pulled in age purely for the legal example. Also, it varies across states. In my state of California for example, it's illegal for any person under 18 to have sex period.   Secondly, he doesn't seem very mature so I worry that he doesn't understand the ramifications of sex. I wonder how much he's thought about protection and the like."
AmItheAsshole,3bgmv0,ClintHammer,-2,Mon Jun 29 03:15:59 2015 UTC,I'm downvoting you because you're seriously not adding to the conversation by questioning someone's own body sovereignty.   It's his body and his choice of he thinks he's ready to get a hand job.   He's old enough to operate a motor vehicle.    Also I can promise you that they don't lock 17 year olds up for having consentual sex.   You need to check that law and stop putting out false information
AmItheAsshole,3bgmv0,Abelithea,2,Mon Jun 29 03:43:34 2015 UTC,"http://www.juvenilelawcenter.com/sex-between-minors/  There you go.   Body sovereignty or not, can I question his willingness to break the law?"
AmItheAsshole,3bgmv0,ClintHammer,-4,Mon Jun 29 03:51:30 2015 UTC,"If a law is unjust, you're under no moral obligation to follow it.   Also you're making a big assumption that it's against the law where OP is."
AmItheAsshole,3bgmv0,Abelithea,-3,Mon Jun 29 03:56:02 2015 UTC,"didn't need to be sex just wanted a little more affection, if that's the right word.   Thank you for your input"
AmItheAsshole,3bgmv0,Magstem,6,Mon Jun 29 01:51:32 2015 UTC,"Sex isn't only PIV (penis in vagina). Handjobs and the like are sexual activities. They fall under the canopy that is sex. You can have a sexual relationship with a friend that's not boyfriend and girlfriend as well. (Friends with benefits.)   Seriously, you have too little knowledge to be getting into such things. Don't even consider it until you know more and you understand what a romantic relationship is and can differentiate it from a sexual one."
AmItheAsshole,3bgmv0,Abelithea,1 point,Mon Jun 29 02:03:42 2015 UTC,"Followup question, what were you're plans to avoid pregnancy if it went the rout of sex?"
AmItheAsshole,3bgmv0,ClintHammer,0,Mon Jun 29 22:58:41 2015 UTC,Me using a condom and pulling out and her using birth control. Try to minimize chance of pregnancy as much as possible (i'm not ready to be a dad)
AmItheAsshole,3bgmv0,mrnatrocks,6,Tue Jun 30 02:21:17 2015 UTC,"Birth control isn't just a one time thing you take at the beginning of the day and bam you can't get pregnant that day, it needs to be taken regularly to work and it's a huge commitment on her part.   Just throwing some extra info at you for the future."
AmItheAsshole,3bgmv0,nadeshdara,2,Tue Jun 30 17:09:33 2015 UTC,"No.   You have expectations from a relationship that are different than your girlfriend.   It's perfectly normal for a boy your age to be interested in sexual experimenting.    You'll find a you get older, that you're under no obligation to stay in a relationship with someone with incompatible relationship goals."
AmItheAsshole,3bgmv0,roseffin,1 point,Mon Jun 29 02:45:21 2015 UTC,"Same thing happened to me and at the same age, you want what you want. That won't change. So you're not an asshole and leaving her would be the best for the both of you."
AmItheAsshole,3bgmv0,subtle_nirvana92,0,Wed Jul 1 13:43:23 2015 UTC,"I don't think breaking up with her makes you an asshole. I do think you need to be upfront with your next girl- or boyfriend that not having sex is a deal breaker for you, save everyone involved some time and grief.  Also, you might want to get some sex ed if you think that oral and outercourse don't constitute sex. :) Knowledge is power, and it can help you have a better time with partnered sex when you get around to it. Sexplanations on youtube and Scarleteen are good places to start that have both practical advice and lots of background information."
AmItheAsshole,3bgmv0,90ne1,1 point,Mon Jun 29 08:02:14 2015 UTC,I don't think that wanting to start experimenting after a year necessitates telling your next girlfriend that sex is a dealbreaker.  Sex is pretty much always a dealbreaker at some point.
AmItheAsshole,3bd534,NerdGasem,12,Sun Jun 28 02:23:42 2015 UTC,"You're not the asshole.  You know something isn't right here. Your girlfriend hangs out with a guy that touches her inappropriately despite the fact that she ""doesn't like it"" and tells him to stop. Why would she put up with that..."
AmItheAsshole,3bd534,ThePlottingPanda,10,Sun Jun 28 02:34:21 2015 UTC,"Well, she never said she didn't like it. The fact that it keeps going on and she keeps hanging out with him makes me think that she does. Maybe it's the attention."
AmItheAsshole,3bd534,Abelithea,5,Sun Jun 28 03:23:58 2015 UTC,"Yes. Talk to her about your concerns. She should respect that it makes you uncomfortable, or at least shed light on it."
AmItheAsshole,3bd534,ThePlottingPanda,28,Sun Jun 28 03:30:57 2015 UTC,"Why would you girlfriend want to hang around a guy that consistently grabs her ass, especially after telling him not to?  You're not an asshole -- but the fact your girlfriend keeps wanting to hang out with this guy gives me a bad vibe."
AmItheAsshole,3bd534,Capn21,13,Sun Jun 28 02:33:19 2015 UTC,Gives me a very bad vibe also. Thanks for giving me your thoughts.
AmItheAsshole,3bd534,notapantsday,4,Sun Jun 28 03:02:44 2015 UTC,"Why would you girlfriend want to hang around a guy that consistently grabs her ass, especially after telling him not to?   Because she likes the attention."
AmItheAsshole,3bd534,KeyTBoi,15,Sun Jun 28 13:11:37 2015 UTC,"Of course not.  Your girlfriend is. Her ""friend"" is. You arent.  If the guy is that close with your gf and that makes you uncomfortable and she doesnt respect that, you shouldnt be with her ."
AmItheAsshole,3bd534,ArabRedditor,11,Sun Jun 28 02:33:56 2015 UTC,dump your gf   Or how about they talk about it like adults
AmItheAsshole,3bd534,MakeLulzNotWar,2,Sun Jun 28 08:16:56 2015 UTC,"Reddit's typical relationship advice, regardless of the situation, seems to be ""get rid of her."""
AmItheAsshole,3bd534,notapantsday,3,Sun Jun 28 11:32:38 2015 UTC,"They have talked. He said that he's uncomfortable with this situation. She didn't respect his concerns and said he was an asshole.  When talking fails, it's time to dump that bitch."
AmItheAsshole,3bd534,lantech,1 point,Sun Jun 28 21:26:46 2015 UTC,"But, what if they're not adults?"
AmItheAsshole,3bd534,Rangerbear,5,Sun Jun 28 13:23:38 2015 UTC,"I told her that I don't want her to hangout with this guy   What did you say, exactly? Depending on how you worded it, this could be anything from expressing concern over the guy's behaviour, to an order forbidding her from seeing him again. ""she got mad at me and said I'm an asshole for not allowing her to hangout with her friend"" -  is this an overreaction on her part, or did you actually tell her they couldn't hang out?"
AmItheAsshole,3bd534,MY-HARD-BOILED-EGGS,9,Sun Jun 28 12:33:12 2015 UTC,"It was a ""I don't feel comfortable with you hanging out with a guy like this""  Wasn't a demand."
AmItheAsshole,3bd534,MrDub72off,3,Sun Jun 28 05:59:00 2015 UTC,"I was in a staggeringly similar situation a few years ago. I mean, right down to the ass-grabbing ""friend."" She ended up leaving me for him, and they're still together today.  Obviously this doesn't mean the same is going to happen to you. How long have you and your girlfriend been together? And how well do you trust her? Keep in mind, some people do have the capacity to overlook shit like ass-grabbing as ""harmless flirting"" (even though it isn't) and opt simply to remain friends with said person."
AmItheAsshole,3bd534,iRuester,7,Sun Jun 28 06:01:12 2015 UTC,"Dude your girlfriend is going or wants to hook up with that guy case closed. Come on man they are literally playing ""grab-ass"". Use your head you know you're not an asshole. You're young she's young. Move on, or hang out with another girl and see how she likes it."
AmItheAsshole,3bd534,whalemango,3,Sun Jun 28 04:44:01 2015 UTC,"You are not the asshole, but she probably hangs out with him because she is cheating. Go with your gut"
AmItheAsshole,3bd534,notapantsday,2,Sun Jun 28 08:05:35 2015 UTC,"You need to confront him, not her. And do it in front of her and some other people. Make him at least address what's really going on, one way or the other. You don't need to be super confrontational, just ask why he thinks it's ok to grab her ass when she's your girlfriend. Don't be confrontational, but don't back down or laugh it off either. He'll probably try to make it a joke. Don't let him. And watch your girlfriend's reaction. If she's kind of impressed, then she's still yours. If she takes his side... Well, sorry, but maybe not.  A sneaky guy like this only gets away with stealing girls (and that sounds like that's what he's doing) because he isn't called out on it. Once it's brought into the open, in front of a group of people, he'll know he can't keep doing it. He'll either have to back down or go after your girl openly (making him look like a prick in front of everyone else, which he won't want).  Depending on the personalities involved, you might want to be prepared for a fight though."
AmItheAsshole,3bd534,wickedplayer494,2,Sun Jun 28 05:42:50 2015 UTC,"I was in exactly the same situation as you are right now.  I told her I was uncomfortable with her meeting him and asked her to break off contact with him. She found excuses why she still needed to see him (""He's going through a rough time and doesn't have any other friends"") and while I was still very, very uncomfortable with this, I was stupid enough to convince myself that it was all good.  A few weeks later she confessed to me that she was cheating with him.  You're definitely not the asshole here, she is. There's a reason why you feel bad about the whole thing, trust your feelings."
AmItheAsshole,3bd534,kreactor,1 point,Sun Jun 28 12:09:30 2015 UTC,No
AmItheAsshole,3bd534,benito823,1 point,Sun Jun 28 13:10:53 2015 UTC,"Yes, in a way you might be the asshole. From your girlfriends perspective you are trying to forbid her from seeing one of here friends, which is very possessive of you, also aside from being very controlling it also shows that you do not trust her, which might be the underling problem here."
AmItheAsshole,3bd534,kreactor,2,Sun Jun 28 08:43:51 2015 UTC,Maybe the underlying issue is that she is unworthy of trust. That seems to be the case from this side of the story. Not wanting something to happen isn't the same as demanding that it doesn't happen.
AmItheAsshole,3bd534,blackoutHalitosis,1 point,Sun Jun 28 15:19:26 2015 UTC,"Yes, that would be a reason for him not trusting her."
AmItheAsshole,3bd534,blackoutHalitosis,1 point,Sun Jun 28 17:05:39 2015 UTC,Been there. Eventually they will fuck. She is being pretty selfish- she needs to decide what she wants and commit to one or the other. Edit: next time he grabs her ass punch him really hard in the face.

AmItheAsshole,3bd9za,Abelithea,6,Sun Jun 28 03:47:20 2015 UTC,I would agree with this. If you don't want to deal with the qausi-long distance relationship then break it off before looking for someone else.
AmItheAsshole,3bd9za,-Unproductive-,26,Sun Jun 28 04:36:56 2015 UTC,"yes, you are an asshole. how would you feel if you found out she was looking for YOUR replacement?"
AmItheAsshole,3bd9za,gambino_girl,1 point,Sun Jun 28 04:55:59 2015 UTC,"I'm afaid that would require the extra step in empathy that OP does not appear to have right now. Since he is already casting, he would at least partially be relieved to find that she is also looking for someone. Do fully empathise, he'd need to be not looking for someone and find that she was."
AmItheAsshole,3bd9za,OsakaWilson,18,Wed Jul 1 23:57:19 2015 UTC,"Just tell her what you're doing.  Wait, you're hiding your actions because you already know she will be hurt, angry, offended, or break up with you?  Duh. Of course you're a bad guy here.  That part of you trying to say you're not? That part of you is a liar. Don't believe his lies."
AmItheAsshole,3bd9za,dcb720,12,Sun Jun 28 05:05:21 2015 UTC,"You're an asshole for not breaking up with her. If you know the distance is going to end your relationship, then just end it."
AmItheAsshole,3bd9za,Carlh45,34,Sun Jun 28 05:57:37 2015 UTC,"Asshole.  Are human beings so disposable to you that you're looking for someone to fill a place that isn't even vacant yet? How disrespectful are you? While I don't think your choice to break up with her makes you a bad person, your oddly cavalier attitude about it does."
AmItheAsshole,3bd9za,missshrimptoast,11,Sun Jun 28 03:59:14 2015 UTC,"If you feel as though it's over, and you're behaving as though it's over, please do this person the courtesy of actually ending it. Stringing someone along as your own personal (in)security blanket is not OK."

If nothing's changed, she'll do it again.   You're not the asshole here.  If you could, since she's your sister, and her kids don't deserve to suffer because their mom is an asshole, I'd offer to drive them, or if that's not possible, work with her to come up with alternative arrangements, like a bus or a fellow church goer.  She doesn't need the car for days to take the kids to church.  And if she and her husband are committing criminal offenses in your car, then it could come back to haunt you.  Edit: Fired my typist."

AmItheAsshole,3bdp50,LandVonWhale,-3,Sun Jun 28 08:21:16 2015 UTC,my friends don't know or like him and it doesn't matter why I don't want him to come if your not invited to something you don't just show up.
AmItheAsshole,3bdp50,LandVonWhale,5,Sun Jun 28 09:12:50 2015 UTC,Did you ever explicitly tell him he was not invited? maybe he was just confused?
AmItheAsshole,3bdp50,BootyMessiah,-1,Sun Jun 28 09:46:33 2015 UTC,I told him multiple times that only the three of us are going (me and my 2 friends)
AmItheAsshole,3bdp50,BangYourHead,4,Sun Jun 28 09:49:46 2015 UTC,But did you ever tell him that he wasn't invited? It's easy to assume your invited unless told otherwise especially if they are already hanging out with you.
AmItheAsshole,3bdp50,KeyTBoi,-4,Sun Jun 28 10:09:54 2015 UTC,If I say you are not coming to the movie with us doesn't that imply he isn't invited
AmItheAsshole,3bdp50,KeyTBoi,5,Sun Jun 28 10:11:41 2015 UTC,You know who straight up tells people they arent invited? Assholes.
AmItheAsshole,3bdp50,KeyTBoi,2,Sun Jun 28 19:34:45 2015 UTC,"""Did you straight up tell him he wasn't invited? Because if you didn't it's your fault.  ""Yes I did tell him""  ""Then you're an asshole""  OP can't catch a break"
AmItheAsshole,3bdp50,delqhic,4,Mon Jun 29 04:54:12 2015 UTC,I don't agree with that at all . You don't just show up to peoples houses and hitch a ride with them because you feel like it .
AmItheAsshole,3bdp50,delqhic,4,Mon Jun 29 01:54:24 2015 UTC,"Depending on the reasons you dont want your cousin there, you are the asshole.  If your cousin clearly understood that he wasn't invited and had an idea of the reasons why he wasnt invited then you'd both suck."
AmItheAsshole,3bdp50,delqhic,-2,Sun Jun 28 11:59:51 2015 UTC,Explain why I would suck?
AmItheAsshole,3bdp50,BootyMessiah,6,Sun Jun 28 13:54:41 2015 UTC,"Because he is your cousin. Not an acquaintance you dont like.  Was your cousin an asshole while you were at the movies and afterwards? You left a lot out.  Was he an asshole to your friends?  As far as I see it your cousin wanted to hang out with you and your friends and you didnt want him to because you feel it would be an inconvienience. As far as I know your cousin isnt a grade A asshole and is probably just lonely   On the asshole scale of 1-10 you are a 1,2 or 3 depending on the situation. Not a big deal but you not letting your harmless cousin come with you makes you look like an asshole. Even to your friends."
AmItheAsshole,3bdp50,MrDub72off,2,Sun Jun 28 14:03:57 2015 UTC,"He is an acquaintance I don't like... I don't want to go too much into his personal life but he is a bit of a racist and one of my friends was Mexican, Every time my cousin would see him he would talk about how my cousin owned my Mexican friend."
AmItheAsshole,3bdp50,missshrimptoast,2,Mon Jun 29 01:57:41 2015 UTC,"This is the kind of stuff you need to post from the get go. Your mexican friend doesnt like him. Your cousin is a bit of a racist ass.  From what you gave us I could only assume your cousin was just a persistent ignoramus who you found annoying and who your friends thought was ""weird""."
AmItheAsshole,3bdp50,missshrimptoast,1 point,Mon Jun 29 02:08:16 2015 UTC,"Yeah I would say, that if he was ""normal"" and calm it would be fine but he acts weird and if the room is ever silent he will say a joke and it usually just comes off as offensive ."
AmItheAsshole,3bdp50,justicecupcakes,3,Mon Jun 29 02:12:12 2015 UTC,"If he was going to pay for his own ticket then yes, you're the asshole. You don't even need to interact with him at the cinema, you just sit down and watch the movie then after it just drop him off home. Imagine how he felt after being told he's being left out."
AmItheAsshole,3bdmbr,ChannelSERFER,4,Sun Jun 28 05:37:18 2015 UTC,"If I was on Facebook and I saw this go down then I would think you're both aholes. Of course, he would be the bigger one."
AmItheAsshole,3bdmbr,KeyTBoi,2,Sun Jun 28 12:27:28 2015 UTC,In my experience you'll never sway a religious persons beliefs with facts or logic. You can't reason someone out of something that they weren't reasoned into.  I wouldn't say you were an asshole though.
AmItheAsshole,3bdmbr,tbaked,2,Sun Jun 28 16:24:04 2015 UTC,Yes.
AmItheAsshole,3bdmbr,Funkingthefake,1 point,Sun Jun 28 08:30:01 2015 UTC,"I'm of the opinion that any idea posted in a public forum (facebook, reddit etc) is up for discussion by anyone. So, no, I don't think you're an asshole."
AmItheAsshole,3bc7aa,bluecompton,15,Sat Jun 27 20:53:01 2015 UTC,"She's being an asshole.  She's doing something you've told her you don't like, and she keeps doing it. It's inconsiderate.  It might be some sort of coded way to tell you shed like it if you dressed this way, or acted like that, but still, it's  a total manipulation.    It looks like she's trying to push your buttons, and succeeding."
AmItheAsshole,3bc7aa,Funkingthefake,3,Sat Jun 27 21:06:47 2015 UTC,"No she's always complimented me on my style, she talks about physical features though. She is succeeding, and i'm at the point of just saying fuck it and ending it, because I don't want to always look at my friends and wonder why they're better than me."
AmItheAsshole,3bc7aa,konohasaiyajin,7,Sat Jun 27 21:11:11 2015 UTC,She used to get super upset if I called anyone else pretty   So she's a hypocrite in addition to an ass.  I would suggest giving another try at telling her this behaviour upsets you (more sternly this time) before thinking about kicking her to the curb though.
AmItheAsshole,3bc7aa,Carbon_is_mE,3,Sat Jun 27 22:14:08 2015 UTC,"Thats a good idea, everyone should get a second chance,and if she starts again it just shows a lack of fucks for how i feel."
AmItheAsshole,3bc7aa,missshrimptoast,6,Sat Jun 27 22:22:15 2015 UTC,"Is  this even a question? If you have asked her to stop, and she didn't, then she is the assshole. Maybe once, joking around but not when you have told her that you don't like it."
AmItheAsshole,3bc7aa,MrDub72off,4,Sat Jun 27 21:05:52 2015 UTC,"Well I am super paranoid about being too controlling or sensitive, I just need validation that i'm not being either of those."
AmItheAsshole,3bc7aa,KeyTBoi,2,Sat Jun 27 21:09:22 2015 UTC,"That's some manipulative bullshit right there. Attacking your partner when they've angered you is the exact opposite reaction you should have. I'm assuming by your post that you and your girlfriend are young, and this is why this sort of immaturity hasn't been fully addressed yet.  This well-he-didn't-bring-me-flowers-on-our-two-week-anniversary-so-I'm-going-to-tell-him-that-Juan-makes-me-wet nonsense only ever serves to harm a relationship. Address it. Now. She's likely insecure and lashing out. Understandable, but unacceptable. This has less to do with you being controlling and more to do with poor communication.  Also, no, not the asshole. Seriously, address this or I guarantee you're in for months of garbage before you two finally break it off."
AmItheAsshole,3bcygj,Ceaya,11,Sun Jun 28 01:14:05 2015 UTC,"I'm done playing nice with this shit.  You either have a traumatic brain injury or you're a troll.  Either way this sub is the wrong place for you.  If you can't see how that was an overreaction, then you know what? Fine. You're not an asshole.  Good luck with life, you dumb fuck.  Edit: Okay, maybe that's some harsh wording, but this post isn't honest, and I'll tell you why:   First of, unless the chair is on fire, yeah, pushing a younger kid out of a chair makes you an asshole. No teacher on earth would be okay with that, the way OP describes it.  A student assaulted another student in my class. Haha!  If OP is honest, and there were no repercussions, and everyone was seemingly on his side, and he is so confident that he was not an asshole, then why, for all that is good and holy, would he come here after years and ask this question?  It's bullshit."
AmItheAsshole,3bcygj,Funkingthefake,6,Sun Jun 28 01:29:00 2015 UTC,"Seriously though, I don't know where these people are coming from. Aforementioned podcast? Some other ad? They always seem to come in waves and never understand what this sub is for."

The kid is a fuckin jerk, and is known to piss people off and think he can get away with whatever. Ya, no repercussions. Hes friends were pissed, but 90% of everyone else didnt give a shit because like i said, the kid is known to be a fuckin jerk. Im sorry man, but i didnt make it up. I already said i was just curious to see what other people think. I didnt come here to see everyone else say how i was in the right and blah blah blah, i just wanted to see what other peoples opinion on it were.

AmItheAsshole,3b9icg,SeanInReddit,15,Sat Jun 27 02:08:34 2015 UTC,"It is hard to have people with clinical depressio close to you because we want our close friends and loved ones to be happy and depression takes all the blood out of life. Your caring can go down the drain, and I dont think anyone is at fault.  If you decide to give up on them, you might be an asshole, depending on how sensitively you go about it. Your best bet is to just let them know youre theyre for them.  This is complex shit man. Wrong sub for this really. Not about being an asshole here. Its about whether or not you give up on someone who may or may not be a lost cause. If they kill themselves, theyre definitely the asshole, and if you know you did all you could to stop it then you are not. But we cant be expected to save every persons life.  If you really care about this friend just do your best and DONT BURN ANY BRIDGES. But dont feel bad if he pushes you away too much to continue."
AmItheAsshole,3b9icg,DoubleFatSmack,6,Sat Jun 27 05:05:02 2015 UTC,"Solid advice... I'll stick it out, if only not to waste a very very old friendship. Thanks for the reply."
AmItheAsshole,3b9icg,Funkingthefake,8,Sat Jun 27 05:42:15 2015 UTC,"Look, I can't tell you what to do about your friend, and like others have said, AITA probably isn't the question to ask.    I have danced the dance with severe depression, and I have had friends who have too.  You've been trying to help, probably giving him words of encouragement, trying to cheer him up, inviting him out, and everything you do he doesn't respond to or shrugs off, and it feels almost insulting.  But that's the thing about clinical depression: what works for normal people doesn't work.  Clinical depression is a dirty liar, and it is delusional.  All those times he backed out on you? I guarantee he sweated bullets agonizing, I would put down money he felt like you all would have a better time without him.  And that's probably not true, that's the depression talking.  Those sad, almost silly comments he makes that sound like a Morrissey record on repeat?  That's probably as close as he can get to opening up.  But you can't fix this.  You aren't his therapist, or his personal Jesus Christ.  Right now you can't stand each other because you don't know how to help him, and he doesn't know how to get help.  Am I wrong?  So what do you do?  You do what you can to get him into a doctor's office.  ""I cant be your friend because you have a mental illness"" is an asshole route.  ""I need to you to get treatment because I can't sit by and watch you destroy yourself and our friendship"" is much more helpful.  Give them the opportunity to work on this.  That's the best thing you can do to help."
AmItheAsshole,3b9icg,Viperbunny,5,Sat Jun 27 05:53:09 2015 UTC,"I don't think you are the asshole here. It's hard because you care, but it can be very stressful to deal with. You want to help your friend, but you can't force him to get help. You can't ignore all your other relationships and be his babysitter. You want to be there for him, listen and help him work out his problems, but it can be a one way street so much of the time. It also sounds like misery wants company and he doesn't want you to be happy because he isn't happy. He doesn't sound like a good friend. I get that being clinically depressed means he is going to have issues and need more understanding and compassion, but that doesn't give him and excuse to constantly be an emotional vampire who feeds off making other people as miserable as he is.  I am clinically depressed. I am under a doctor's care and am doing pretty well. It doesn't mean I don't have my moments where I need someone to be there for me. I can be a bit morose at points, but it isn't an all the time deal. I talk through my problems and look through solutions. I understand that other people have things to do and that they don't owe me 100% of their time and attention.  It sounds like your friend needs more help than you can give him. If he won't seek it on his own, you may want to talk to h=is parents or a guidance counselor at your school and explain your concerns. Best of luck."
AmItheAsshole,3b9icg,Abelithea,2,Sat Jun 27 05:58:07 2015 UTC,All I feel qualified to say in this situation is that you're not an asshole.
AmItheAsshole,3b9icg,EHendrix,2,Sat Jun 27 02:12:17 2015 UTC,"If he has a genuine clinical depression you MAY be the asshole, he may be pushing everyone away because of feelings of self loathing and worthlessness. If he is depressed then he needs someone to go out of their way to show him that they care. If he is just an angsty teen then you are not the asshole."
AmItheAsshole,3b9icg,Abelithea,-1,Sat Jun 27 02:43:06 2015 UTC,"To me, the strength of a friendship lies in how well they stick together during hard times. This is an example of a weak friendship and OP doesn't seem inclined to help out further at this point. You know what, thinking on this, he does seem like a bit of an asshole, because regardless of his own helplessness, he doesn't seem to be pushing his friend toward any professional help either."
AmItheAsshole,3b9icg,Abelithea,0,Sat Jun 27 02:52:14 2015 UTC,"Didn't mention that I once tried to get him to go to a school councilor if only to keep him from going directly to a shrink. He takes it as a joke and my attempts to help go awry.  EDIT: I knew if I said ""let's go see a therapist"" or ""You need help"" he'd straight up say no. I can't exactly force someone to get help."
AmItheAsshole,3b9icg,monodons,-1,Sat Jun 27 05:43:27 2015 UTC,"No, but you can convince them they need it.   As someone who's been through depression and who's lost a friend to suicide, you're being pretty bare bones here."
AmItheAsshole,3b9icg,jebuss_cripes,0,Sat Jun 27 05:55:56 2015 UTC,"If he is genuinely depressed, than maybe. But things like ""My life is full of despair"" and casually calling any random day ""the worst day of his life""along with sending me random depressing anime quotes makes me think he just wants to have constant drama around him.   Maybe he says things like that AND is depressed, and at that point I'd be okay with being the asshole."
AmItheAsshole,3b9icg,missshrimptoast,2,Sat Jun 27 05:41:09 2015 UTC,"Hey, you are not the arsehole, people like this can be super annoying and expect you to put up with them because they can't put up with themselves, depression makes me people very selfish. He may spiral downwards, in which case I think you just need to go there with him without letting it destroy your life too much, and also try and offer support for his family (if he has one) it will be 10 times worse for them! He may also learn to cope, in which case he'll probably come back to you. So many people go through these depressed phases, most people come out of it or learn to cope, occasionally people lose control, I hope your friend isn't that guy, stats are in your favour"
AmItheAsshole,3b85d3,bendtilubreak,11,Fri Jun 26 19:10:20 2015 UTC,"Nah, don't hang out with people that you don't like to hang out with. It's not worth the time. The only credit you should give her is about the black boyfriend. I once took a black girl home to Thanksgiving, thinking it would be no big deal since the family has many black friends and acquaintances, and received an unexpected backlash. One uncle in particular still hasn't spoken a word to me and leaves the room every time I visit. (dick).  But nah, depending on how old ya'll are, the drunk party girl thing and the giving you grief for focusing on a job has to stop sometime. I've realized that most of my early to mid-twenties were realizing how much I no longer liked my teenage friends. People change, find some new ones."
AmItheAsshole,3b85d3,Curses_at_bots,2,Fri Jun 26 20:11:25 2015 UTC,"Oh man, I'm so sorry your family acted that way.  I can't even imagine the pressure.  I tried to be understanding, but I think it was hard at the time give the circumstances.  I know her family would probably be not accepting of her dating a black guy, but in a way I assumed she'd know I'm not like that.  I think in a way I thought she'd think higher of me, but maybe that's an inappropriate assumption.  I guess I thought she'd know me better than that.    We're both early 30s, and I agree that understanding about how life gets in way is a normal thing. The thing that gets me is that she used work as an excuse to not come visit me when I was sick, and I fully accepted that.  But because it was not a real excuse, she can't understand that being real for me.  I've definitely found some great friends, but I was just worried I was being an asshole for not being interested in trying to make it work.  Thanks for the input!"
AmItheAsshole,3b85d3,Abelithea,9,Sat Jun 27 05:13:47 2015 UTC,I kinda feel like she wants to work things out so she could still use your apartment as a place to stay whenever she wants to go into the city.
AmItheAsshole,3b85d3,snuffyboots,3,Fri Jun 26 20:31:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think you're not too far off.  A mutual friend told me she was here twice within the last month for various events, and asked if she stayed with me (they don't know about the fallout b/c I didn't want to bad mouth her).  So I think her having to pay for a hotel might have made her ""think of me"" more than she would have otherwise!"
AmItheAsshole,3b85d3,snuffyboots,5,Sat Jun 27 05:17:13 2015 UTC,"Also, here's my opinion: You're not an asshole, but people change.  You didn't give any year marks to indicate how long it's been since the last incident with the guys in your hotel room.  Time mends old wounds, and she very well may have matured since that time.  You, too.  So no, I don't technically think you're an asshole for not wanting to have anything to do with her, but you might be plesantly surprised."
AmItheAsshole,3b85d3,flignir,1 point,Fri Jun 26 20:14:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think I'm a little torn about the whole thing.  I probably should have given date ranges.  I was sick fall of 2012, she told me about the boyfriend in March of 2013, our beach trip was July 2013, and the Thanksgiving issue was November 2013.  So we haven't spoken in a year and half, but she's contacted me through email lately wanting to rekindle.  We haven't defriended each other on facebook and based on some of her post I don't think she's grown very much, but that might be an assumption."
AmItheAsshole,3b85d3,flignir,2,Sat Jun 27 05:21:26 2015 UTC,"Look, as someone who has cut people out of my life because I didn't want to watch them make stupid mistakes... This one is really up to you.  My only advice is that if you do decide to ""decline"" her request, you need to completely cut her off.  And tell her, so that she understands and yeah, she may dislike you, but then she'll know exactly where the two of you stand.  You obviously have history.  Girls get crap like this, and if she really has changed you'll see her at a reunion someday and you'll catch up.  Good luck!"
AmItheAsshole,3b85d3,flignir,2,Sat Jun 27 19:43:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's a great point.  I should really be clear about my intentions.  Thanks for suggesting that, you are totally right.  I think my gut is telling me that I don't want to be her friend anymore, but others telling me I'm being to harsh and should give her a chance made me second guess myself.  I'll be direct and clear, and then move on.  And you're right, maybe we'll cross paths in the future and things will be friendly.  Thanks!"
AmItheAsshole,3b85d3,snuffyboots,3,Mon Jun 29 01:36:52 2015 UTC,Can we get a TL;DR?
AmItheAsshole,3b85d3,missshrimptoast,2,Fri Jun 26 19:27:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I didn't realize how long that was!  I put one now, but even that feels long... Thanks for pointing out that it needs one!"
AmItheAsshole,3b7f61,gigdy,33,Fri Jun 26 16:01:44 2015 UTC,You. Why would you do that? You don't know him either. Let him make his own decisions.
AmItheAsshole,3b7f61,SiberianHuskies,-13,Fri Jun 26 16:07:24 2015 UTC,By not shutting off his car and leaving it unattended he endangers everyone at the gas station.
AmItheAsshole,3b7f61,starryeyedq,25,Fri Jun 26 16:14:09 2015 UTC,"He didn't leave it unattended, he was sitting in his car. Clearly, you're not intimidated by being confrontational so you could have knocked on the window and politely said, ""Hey, you might want to shut off your car. It's pretty dangerous for everyone here to leave it running like that.""  But you didn't do that. You wanted to be dramatic and a dick."
AmItheAsshole,3b7f61,Ultra-ChronicMonstah,6,Fri Jun 26 16:21:29 2015 UTC,"I worked at a petrol station for quite a while when I was younger. Admittedly in the UK but I can't imagine it's much different.  1.) The guy in the car was endangering people, even if it may be in a minuscule way (I mean I guess that he could roll away or some shit). He's also possibly putting the station at risk of legal action, but I don't know what the law is there.   2.) People also seem to get offended and even aggressive when this is pointed out to them. If he was arrogant enough to be sat in a running car on his phone next to an active petrol pump, ignoring basic knowledge of what's legal, there's a good chance that he's too stupid to listen to reason.  But with that said, I agree that OP should have at least tried to talk to him before hanging up the gas pump, even though it probably wouldn't have worked."
AmItheAsshole,3b7f61,starryeyedq,3,Fri Jun 26 17:27:56 2015 UTC,"Totally. That's my point. What's the worst that could have happened? The guy is a jerk about it so OP is then welcome to do what he originally did.  I agree with you that people can get offended when they're embarrassed, but approaching someone in a way that gives the impression that you're assuming they would WANT to be helpful and you're just helping them out (almost like pointing out that their fly is down), you'd be surprised how agreeable people are inclined to be."
AmItheAsshole,3b7f61,starryeyedq,-12,Fri Jun 26 18:01:46 2015 UTC,"""Hey, you might want to shut off your car. It's pretty dangerous for everyone here to leave it running like that.""   You must be new.  Have you met people?"
AmItheAsshole,3b7f61,azon01,10,Fri Jun 26 17:06:15 2015 UTC,"Yes...? You'd be extremely surprised how people react when approached pleasantly but firmly.

AmItheAsshole,3b7f61,bilscuits,1 point,Fri Jun 26 17:58:22 2015 UTC,Yeah you are a dick here. Most people are not bad if you are polite about it. If he would've been a dick oh well sooner or later his luck will run out if he keeps doing dumb stuff.
AmItheAsshole,3b7f61,Ultra-ChronicMonstah,22,Mon Jun 29 06:49:42 2015 UTC,"You are the only asshole in the situation, and you should mind your own business.  Leaving a car running while pumping gas has about a 0% chance of causing an explosion. It's an archaic rule that's only really there because that's how it's always been. Do you walk up to people on their cell phones at gas stations and take their phones from them too? That also doesn't cause explosions, btw.   He wasn't endangering anybody, and you were being an asshole."
AmItheAsshole,3b7f61,Situis,3,Fri Jun 26 16:21:29 2015 UTC,"He could have been putting the station at risk of legal action, but I don't know what the law is for OP.

If this is the 3rd thing this month that you were unlucky enough to be the only one present for the breaking of, you can understand her assumption.   Shower heads are meant to adjust for the exactly the problem you have, and if it was decently constructed, you should be easily able to do that 3,000 times before it becomes a maintenance issue.  I wouldn't even say you need to be particularly careful about it.  Check it out for rust or decayed metal at the breaking point and show her you're blameless, if you find anything like that."

Is she making you pay for the replacement, or grounding you, or otherwise punishing you for this?  People like to assume that people break things, and that things don't just break on their own because their old.  That being said, if you really didn't break it intentionally, you're not the asshole."

AmItheAsshole,3ata7j,bagboyrebel,3,Tue Jun 23 22:57:52 2015 UTC,"Okay, here's a point that you probably haven't considered... I don't know what your particular home situation is, but if you 4 men are constantly leaning on your mom for things (housekeeping stuff, I mean) then I can see how your dad might be worried that he doesn't have the time to handle this stuff while your mom's away.  He probably brainstormed ""Dad ideas"" of how to turn this to his benefit and use this as a real life audition.  There's no nice way to start preparing you for living on your own, he probably thinks he's doing you a favor.  I don't think you're an asshole in this situation, for objecting to additional work at the last minute, and I don't think he's an asshole for suggesting it."
AmItheAsshole,3ata7j,snuffyboots,5,Tue Jun 23 13:44:15 2015 UTC,Put them in the fridge the night before.  Problem solved.
AmItheAsshole,3ata7j,Mustaka,3,Tue Jun 23 14:08:18 2015 UTC,"There are two (actually four) separate issues going on here:  1) The simple request you asked of him with the food in the freezer  2) The simple request you asked of him with the sausages  The freezer request is something that happens in general human interactions like ""Do you have a pen I could use for a second?"" or ""Could you check the mail while you are taking out the trash?"" which are simple things done on goodwill which are asshole-ish to turn down. However if your dad was too busy, running late, or had forgotten about taking the food out of the freezer you take that in stride, just like you would if someone was using their only pen to take notes and so refused to give it to you or if it started pouring down with rain so you didn't stop to check the letterbox.  You responded to your dad's refusal to do the simple goodwill request by refusing a similar gesture. The thing is that you were being antagonistic about it, and this brought things to a head. I think that's a bit dickish, honestly.  I alsp think your dad's response was over the top. He could have easily said ""With the time and energy it's taken you to ask me to do that, you could have had it done already"" or ""We can make a running tally of how much each of us contributes to this house, but if I were you I wouldn't play that card"" and it would have adjusted the power relationship you have into something more in line with what he's expecting of you without the need to fly off the handle.  But behind that are two other issues. Three actually, but let me deal with the next two like I said I would:  The issue for your dad is that he's trying to ""teach"" you to be independent by pulling the rug out from under you. You aren't going to learn any special skills or gain extra responsibility by getting up a 5 to defrost your food. His uncompromising approach doesn't solve anything and all it does is erode the goodwill between you. He could use that favor as an opener/leverage to ask you to do something that needs to be done (e.g. ""Alright, just make sure that you pick up the dog poop in the yard tomorrow afternoon"" or ""Sure, but remember that tomorrow is your night for the dishes""). He could have also told you that if you put the frozen food into the fridge at least 24 hours before you intend to eat it, it will be defrosted but it will also keep for a few days because you are keeping it within a safe temperature range, thus teaching you a lesson in planning ahead, in food safety, and also reaffirming your autonomy and responsibility for yourself.  Then there is your response to his refusal. You escalated the situation. That's not a good idea, especially when you're living at home and relying on your parents one way or another. You can play tit-for-tat with him and you will lose.  Last of all, based purely on what you've said, including your dad's behavior, it seems to me that your mom going away without your dad and your dad's sudden reaction that you ""need to stop relying on him""/""you need to learn how to take care of yourself"" sort of attitude speaks to something deeper again — your parents are probably going through a rough patch. I suspect that they might be having a breakdown in communication, and maybe that divorce is being considered. That would explain your dad's sudden shift in attitude and both of his overreactions that you mentioned. Or it could be something else like his job being threatened. Whatever the case, I think that your dad is grappling with something that threatens the fundamental stability of your family and I can assure you that now is not the right time to go picking fights with a family member who is going through a difficult patch.  TL;DR: I think that your dad started the dickishness, and I think that he handled your push back in a pretty dickish way, but you aren't totally in the clear yourself and I think that there's something else going on behind all of this."

For example, having them bring their own dishes to the kitchen when done eating, even though I am also going that way and could just take them.  It's not about me saving work, it's about me getting them to work.  You know what I hear sometimes when I ask them to do stuff?  ""But can't you do it?""  Sure, I can.  But they need to learn how.  Not just KNOW how.  Learn to be OKAY with putting in extra effort.  Learning to do stuff that's hard.  Learning to do stuff that's inconvenient.  Being self-reliant.  Not balking at some extra work, because work is normal for them.  You're asking your dad for FAVORS and he is declining.  He doesn't sound like an asshole at all.  You don't either.  What you sound like is a young person that still has growing to do.  Treat your parents with respect even when you don't agree.  You know, it's easy to obey them when you agree with them.

AmItheAsshole,3aq18j,Barely_Intrepid,1 point,Tue Jun 23 10:10:24 2015 UTC,"AITA being mad at her? Kinda yes.    There was no commitment between you.  It even seems like she was telling you she might not be interested.    AITA being mad at my friend? .. if he knew you were 'in negotiations' with her, no. He should have respected you enough to talk first, or at least not do that in front of you.   At 17-18, you are all practically adults.    You each make decisions for yourself.   In some cases, I'd respect the both of them for just reaching out and taking what they wanted.     OTOH, at this age, a lot of this romance/dating/relationship stuff is just drama.   Everybody is insecure, even if it doesn't look that way.   Say and do what you mean.  No hidden agenda, no signals, no extra meanings.    No games.    If you don't discuss it, you really can't expect the other person to know what you want or feel.   If you wanted to date her - you need to speak up.   Just because she kissed another guy, it doesn't mean they are married.   You can still ask her out. If you want your friends to give you a couple of days while you get up the nerve.. you need to tell them;  and you need to get the nerve up faster.  If you like a girl, even while you are just betting to know her - you need to let her know that you are single, and you -might- be interested in dating.    This avoids that whole 'friendzone' misunderstanding crap.    If you don't put it out there - the other person doesn't know.      Finally,  rejection hurts.  It always does.    Rejection is part of life, or you aren't really living.      You won't get every job you want, you won't get picked for every team,  and you won't always date the girl you ask.      Eventually, you realize that this part can be fun..   the expectation,  the wondering 'what if?',  the nervous anticipation..    all are like an emotional roller coaster.   You know the ride has to end.  You'll get the date - or not.    You'll get the job.. or a different one.     Just feel the nerves.. then feel happy or rejected when you get the answer."

AmItheAsshole,3arzbc,Bambi53,2,Tue Jun 23 08:51:18 2015 UTC,She probably thinks it's cute. You should talk to her about how you don't appreciate it and how you see it when she does that instead of just being annoyed with her.

A big part of a relationship is being able to talk to your SO. This friend group that your boyfriend is now a member of seems to be changing him. I would encourage you to try and convince him to leave, and if he still stands on his opinion of choosing drugs over you, it may be time to move on."
AmItheAsshole,3aq8fc,Dipping,10,Mon Jun 22 17:11:36 2015 UTC,"You're zero percent asshole here.  Your boyfriend is a judgemental idiot hypocrite.

AmItheAsshole,3aq8fc,Funkingthefake,3,Mon Jun 22 17:33:28 2015 UTC,"I'd say you did everything right here. You tried to talk to him, he shut down your attempt at communication, and (presumably) went ahead and did cocaine despite the fact that you had made it clear that you were uncomfortable with this.   Unfortunately there is nothing more you can do. If your boyfriend wants to do cocaine, he is going to. It is a great shame, but you can't help people that don't want your help.    Even if the issue wasn't hard drugs, his outrageous hypocrisy and unwillingness to even open up a dialogue with you seem like bad signs.    Even though you are in no way an asshole here, he is going to make you feel like one for as long as you try to keep him from hurting himself."

It's a long way from highschool to college and beyond, and people eventually change and out grow each other.  It probably doesn't feel this way, but you're better off without him.  Anyone who is trying to control your life (saying that you CAN'T do something) is ridiculous.  Especially at your age.  Find a new, older, more reasonable boyfriend and start again."
AmItheAsshole,3aq8fc,snuffyboots,2,Mon Jun 22 19:57:26 2015 UTC,"Your boyfriend is a hypocritical asshole.  He is doing the same thing he said he'd break up with you for.  Cocaine is really bad for you, and even though I'm don't like tripping, a little acid once in a while is not a bad thing.  It's your body, after all.  Sounds like a bit of a control freak.  I've been there, sweetie, and if you give him an inch...well, the next thing he's telling you what you shouldn't eat, wear, etc.  Ordinarily, I wouldn't say break up with him automatically, that you should tell him how you feel, but ""talking never works""?  That makes no sense at all.  It sounds like you're doing great and growing up and making good decisions and he is regressing."

Your boyfriend on the other hand, definitely an asshole. And a hypocrite.   Besides the fact that he's telling you what you can and can't do, he's also going to go and do those things. I would remind him of his, ""I'll break up with you if you do cocaine"" line, see what he says and if he continues than dump him to the curb."

I don't know how severe your depression is, but it's clear that it's starting to impact your life, so get some professional help, if you haven't already.  You might want to hop on over to #depression, because they deal with this stuff a lot.  Also, see if there's a local support group like DBSA, because it feels like nobody understands you when you're like this, and they will.  Bring the gf, too, so she can have a better perspective on what's up with you.  Oh yeah, not the asshole."

Ultimately you gotta wanna get out of the state you're in. If you don't, then socialization is going to feel horrible. If even a tiny sliver of you does, then this isn't a bad approach to take. She's trying to help you out, her friends don't give a fuck. You don't know them, but she does. Get her to tell you more about them. Start small, maybe one on one interaction with one of her friends who shares similar interests with you. You can't really throw someone into a new group and expect them to swim in your own. You're a newbie, it's her job to integrate you."

It's more that she is angry at me with how I'm not being sociable that makes me emotional about this all. She has had mental issues and mental health services before, but she's not helping enough to integrate me because all she does is say ""be more sociable, talk more, try"". One on one interaction is harder than a large group for me, but I'm gonna try with all my strength to get better, including being around her friends."

You had sex with this girl, who was clearly super into you, and then you stopped talking to her immediately after having sex. Even casual relationships (barring one night stands) don't cease completely right after the deed is done. You should have at least had this conversation with her face to face, and not over text. But she's a bit of an asshole for telling her parents about it all (especially since she is 16 and you are 19, and that becomes an iffy age gap in certain areas).  Edit - grammar and spelling"

First off, don't ever assume anyone is okay with a friends with benefits situation without asking point blank.  Get a fucking notary.  In fact, if you're going to hook up with someone you've known for a while, it's a pretty good idea to do get on the same page before you get down. That doesn't always happen, but it prevents stuff like this from happening.  Hindsight is 20/20, but you can see now that ""maybe we can get together over the summer"" might have sent the wrong message, and she took it probably different than you meant it.  Again, miscommunication.  And what other people are saying about you? Well, that's all kind of true.  You kind of did hit it and quit it.  You want to fuck without a relationship, fuckboi sounds appropriate, maybe.  Up to this point, this can all be explained by immaturity.    But in your words, this girl was obsessed.  She didn't text you all semester and talk about you non stop because she wanted to bang every once in a while, and I think deep down, you knew that.  Sure, she acted immaturely, but, you know, she's 16, and it kind of looks like you took advantage of an easy situation to get your rocks off.  That's why you're the asshole.  Edit: Spells"

Then you type this:  I don't know about you all, but if I plan on starting a relationship with someone, I probably wouldn't have sex with them on the first ""date"" or whatever you might call our little hangout mesh.  That's bullshit.  You never thought, ""Hmm.  She wants to fuck me, so that probably means she doesn't want to be my girlfriend."" That makes zero sense, and it's a rationalization.  You didn't just meet her, she's known you for months.

In situations like this someone always ends up getting hurt, which is why I avoid ""casual"" FWB relationships. So, how can you make amends here? Call her. Ask her if there's anthing you can do to make the situation right. Be respectful, but clear with your boundaries. And then, don't do anything like this again.

AmItheAsshole,3an6tn,Abelithea,3,Sun Jun 21 21:53:10 2015 UTC,Things break.  But she should offer to replace it.  I know I would.  Have you asked her yet to replace it?  And if so what's her response?  You're not the asshole for wanting her to replace it.  But you also have to consider how much the friendship is worth if she doesn't want to.
AmItheAsshole,3an6tn,Lamzn6,2,Sun Jun 21 22:43:57 2015 UTC,"Well, it won't turn on. Was that the extent of the explanation? If so, she might just not really know how to use it or something happened. Maybe take a look at it, either by having her come over or you come over yourself, and see what the problem is. Find out if and why it broke and if it was clearly her fault, ask her politely if she can replace it. I flooded my dorm room's bathroom once, damaging lots of pads and tampons my roommates owned. They didn't get mad at me in the slightest, but it was clear that I was responsible for replacing them. They gave me a list of what they were going to get, found the best deals on it, ran the price by me, and I paid them back."
AmItheAsshole,3an6tn,deadbeard,5,Sun Jun 21 21:52:37 2015 UTC,Possibly ask her to pay for half of a new one. If you've already gotten a lot of use out of it then this is the least she can do. Realistically and should replace the whole thing but this might be the most you can get out of her.
AmItheAsshole,3an6tn,n00basaurusHAXX,4,Mon Jun 22 00:57:02 2015 UTC,"If someone borrows something they are responsible for it. Regardless of why it broke, it broke while they were in custody of it, so they need to replace it."
AmItheAsshole,3an6tn,MaskedSociopath,3,Mon Jun 22 01:47:35 2015 UTC,I wouldn't say you're the asshole but my policy for lending someone something is always don't lend something of necessity. Odds are anything you lend won't be returned at all or in the condition you gave it.

AmItheAsshole,3an6tn,dinosaur_train,2,Mon Jun 22 06:18:33 2015 UTC,I'd get it back to see if she was doing anything wrong. If there's anything obviously broken that was her doing or she admits she broke it I would ask her to pay for it. But if it seems like it just pooped out I wouldn't ask for any money. It happens.
AmItheAsshole,3al400,newheart_restart,11,Sun Jun 21 06:53:44 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I'm pretty sure I'd do about the same thing.  You're not an asshole because you don't want to hang out with self-proclaimed racists.  If you think about it, you've probably drifted apart from friends for so much less.  The only reason it's weird is because it's such a non-issue for her, that it makes you doubt yourself for not being cool with her."
AmItheAsshole,3al400,Funkingthefake,3,Sun Jun 21 06:57:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah my biggest worry is that I didn't tell her why, and I go back and forth between ""I never gave her a chance to change"" and ""it's not my job to show her what she's doing wrong, she should know"""
AmItheAsshole,3al400,Funkingthefake,7,Sun Jun 21 07:00:20 2015 UTC,"Not your monkey, not your circus.  What are you going to do, force her to watch Crash until she takes it back?"

AmItheAsshole,3al400,DhakaGuy,8,Sun Jun 21 07:13:23 2015 UTC,"Ages ago, I was raised in the 'bible belt' and had some wacky ideas after that socialization. I'm really embarrassed about it now, like super mortified, but I was against things like gay marriage.   Fast forward, I met someone who abhorred racism, bigotry, and intolerance. I'm talking, they had nearly their whole family wiped out by Hitler. Anyway, thankfully, my friend stuck around, slowly worked on me, and eventually undid my socialization.   I'm really glad my friend didn't just label me 'racist' and walk. I wasn't hate filled, I was just a kid and I was ignorant as all hell. Now that I think about it, prejudging me and labeling me as forever an untouchable thing - not a human - a racist - would have been racist like in itself. Since then, 15+ years, I haven't dropped a racist cold turkey when advised. And, along the way, I've changed hearts and minds.   From what I can gather, when people who have racist ideals are rejected then they are left with only people who think like them and the problem grows to their kids and so on. But, if you treat a person with these ideas like a human and try to educate them sometimes you really get somewhere, especially if they care for you.  You aren't an asshole for cutting her off, though. Because ultimately, you have to decide how much toxic stuff you have the energy to filter in your life. If someone is a bad influence you don't need a reason to cut them out of your life. But, I would encourage you to make an attempt to change her heart and mind, slowly, through love and friendship, and see what happens. I'm glad someone stuck around with me and slowly removed those funny hairs. I needed straightening and because of this I believe people can change. The only way they do, though, is education. You have to decide if you want to play that hand."
AmItheAsshole,3al400,Gay_Mechanic,2,Sun Jun 21 15:27:43 2015 UTC,"The only problem I have with this is that if you have differing beliefs with a friend and you decide that your belief structure is superior and try to 'educate' them on it, then that kind of makes you an asshole."
AmItheAsshole,3al400,Funkingthefake,1 point,Sun Jun 21 19:54:13 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your comment, and for the perspective. I agree it would have been ""better"" (as in, it would have made me a good person) to genuinely try and change her mind, or her heart, but I dunno. I get real wound up about stuff like this, so I guess I just didn't want to deal. I'm just making excuses, anyway, it's really just a difficult conversation to have. But again, thanks for your input, I'm going to try and message her in earnest. (And by try I mean try and overcome my own selfish fear, not like it's super hard to do  in like a normal way)"
AmItheAsshole,3al400,Gay_Mechanic,0,Sun Jun 21 19:56:50 2015 UTC,"What a beautiful way to write. If you can then elaborate a little more and then  turn this experience into a magazine article. If it gets published,  readers might act  on it."
AmItheAsshole,3al400,Funkingthefake,6,Mon Jun 22 02:49:24 2015 UTC,"You kind of are an asshole. How about you let her know that you're not cool with that and maybe you guys can carry on and she will know not to say that kind of shit. You are being a coward by avoiding her and not being honest. All over an underhanded slightly racist joke. Everybody these days is becoming over sensitive about offending absolutely anyone. I had a friend that would say ""fucking nigger"" if a black person cut us off in traffic or something. I started saying ""come on that has nothing to do with it"" and he has slowly stopped doing that. This is over the course of 7 years and we have all matured since then. A comment like what your friend made shouldnt be cause for you to suddenly end a friendship because it hurt your feelings."

That's not chill.  I do disagree with the rest of what you said, however. I think I should be allowed to kick someone out of my life if their presence is negative for me, I don't think it's my job to police them. However, I do think the way I did it was uncool. So thank you for your perspective, I do appreciate it."
AmItheAsshole,3al400,sandra_nz,3,Sun Jun 21 19:58:35 2015 UTC,"There's a lot of people saying you should go back and confront this person, and I kind of disagree.  I'm a pretty confrontational person, really, don't get me wrong.  There's a pretty good argument that you should have been less avoidant at the time, and maybe that's true. But you weren't, and you can't always right a mistake.  Going back after weeks of no contact, what exactly would that accomplish?  You might very well be seen as looking for a fight. Imagine if you made a social error with a friend and she stopped talking to you for a couple of months, then called back to tell you exactly why you were wrong.  It would be difficult for anyone to take that well."

Frankly, your racist comments made me uncomfortable and I wanted to cut you off for that reason, but I know it was uncool to not clue you in so I'm sorry for that. If you want to talk about it more I'm open to it, but if not I understand.""  Typing it out now, though, it does seem pretty pointless."

It's 2015, and you're claiming to be a young adult, and you're asking about telling someone off on Facebook.  You don't seem to have anything to say about this person, you clearly think you're above him, and every time you mention him, he's doing something you don't approve of.  Neither of you seem to do what friends do, and I suspect that you only keep him around to make yourself seem smarter.  Frankly, your post and everyone in it stinks of immaturity.  Are you an asshole?

I started dating this girl named Ashleigh, and everything's good, except her friends hate my jokes and call me a loser.  I sent a couple of jokes to Ashleigh, and some of them were about her friend, Cassy.  She shows them to her friend southieee, who decides it's his duty for some reason to inform Cassy that Someone Made a Joke About Her.  So, Cassy and Ashleigh are having this big fight, and southieee is honest to god surprised that they're upset.  I'm not familiar with your regional vernacular, but I'm guessing 'top mate' doesn't mean 'shit disturber.'    Other people might be an asshole in this story, but you're the asshole."

Your callous approach shows that you don't actually care to stand up for your friend, you just wanted to create drama and be the ""good guy"".

Also, from your post I would assume that you and Cassie have said some pretty mean things about Holbert.  You're calling him a loser here.  So, it's a bit hypocritical of you two to talk shit on him, but then get your panties in a wad when he talks shit about you.  Also, Ashleigh is an asshole too.  That was a private conversation that was supposed to be between her and Holbert.  In short, you're all a bunch of assholes."

It is also not even close to being as dangerous as alcohol can be in the hands of certain people with no self control.   Moving on, I will say I don't condone their behavior.

The short list of things she has done, just to give you an idea:  When a friend died (he was from the Middle East and we were his surrogate family) she told my husband that it would be inappropriate for me to fly with him for the services. Yes, we were married at the time. She was going to bring her boyfriend, but it was inappropriate for me to go. I almost punched her right there in the hospital, but I didn't because my husband and our friend's widow didn't need that drama.  She gets mad at me for missing my oldest daughter who died of a genetic disorder six days after birth because she would have been severely disabled if she had survived (it was terminal no matter what, and we didn't know she had it until a few hours before she died).   She ignores me when I try to talk to her.  She got mad when I wouldn't get certain friends out of my husband's life because she thought they would keep him from finishing college. She was wrong and I told her I trusted her son's judgment (he finished college with honors).  She constantly says horrible things to me and about me. She has never once showed me any warmth or kindness.  I understand how one-sided this all seems. But to put it in perspective, my husband's friends call her Hitler."
AmItheAsshole,3aiukr,Diarygirl,7,Sat Jun 20 18:30:36 2015 UTC,"You've been putting up with her abuse for 13 years?  Did you know your husband was a mama's boy before you married him?    I've been in your situation, and I thought it would change.  My first and second husbands' mothers (this is my third husband; this one's for keeps) hated me for no reason at all until I gave them each their first grandchild.  Then they loved me.  For a couple months.  Then they criticized my parenting.  Your husband should tell his mother to back off, but if he hasn't yet I don't think he will.  Telling you to be a big girl and suck it up is not what a man should be saying to his wife.  He should be loyal to you, his wife and the mother of his children."
AmItheAsshole,3aiukr,knuckles523,6,Sat Jun 20 23:08:10 2015 UTC,"He did tell her off. That's just it. He told her that I am his wife and a great mother to his kids and that she needs to be respectful to me. She claims I am disrespectful to her, but neither of us can figure that one out because I have always been respectful.   He wants to make sure things are civil so the kids don't suffer and I get that. He does tell her off. I think a part of him wishes she could show some kind of approval, but she is incapable. He doesn't want the kids to miss out on a relationship with her (she is much softer with them than us). I understand and agree with that. I just didn't want to deal with her right now when I am so mad that it is hard. She acted better towards me today, but I think she knows it's because I am getting to the end of my rope and won't put up with it."

AmItheAsshole,3aiukr,Funkingthefake,3,Sun Jun 21 08:18:17 2015 UTC,"My husband tells me everything. It really upset him. He knows I do so much for our family, but because I stay at home with the kids my mother in law considers me useless. We save so much more money with me staying home and it's what we always planned to do when we had kids. In her mind I am sponging off her son. I work 12-16 hour days with the kids, do the laundry and dishes and cooking and anything else that has to get done. Her granddaughters are healthy and the doctor says they are way ahead of the curve cognitively. That is all because I do nothing, of course. It has nothing to do with the fact I constantly teach them things.   That and she doesn't hide her contempt. It is clear to everyone that she hates me. I do have my faults. My biggest is that I don't drive. I have to get over that and am working on that. Part of that is my parents not letting me drive and part of it has been medications for a chronic pain issue I had that made me uncomfortable driving with. Since the later has gotten better since my hysterectomy, I can start driving. I just wouldn't drive with my kids if I were on medications.  She mostly hates me because her son never had a backbone until I supported him in being his own person. She doesn't have her hooks in him nearly the way she used to and it drives her crazy.  I ended up playing nice, but that was just to get it over with. I just wanted her to go away."
AmItheAsshole,3aiukr,flignir,3,Sat Jun 20 17:19:21 2015 UTC,"It sounds like your husband really owes it to you to make sure his mother gets the message that this is unacceptable.  He's an adult now.  He should not feel like he needs to hide behind his mom's skirt anymore, and if she wants to constantly belittle and mistreat his wife, she shouldn't be welcome in his home.   Some parents need a wake up call, and after he gets married, a son should have the courage and support he needs to deliver it."
AmItheAsshole,3aiukr,Funkingthefake,2,Sat Jun 20 18:23:27 2015 UTC,"He tells her it isn't okay, but then allows her in our home because he doesn't want to keep the kids from her. I don't either. She may hate me, but she loves them and they deserve a relationship with her. I just don't want to have to pretend to be okay with it when she say so many hurtful things.  The whole thing got worse when my husband let her know we were considering moving closer to my parents because our kids love the community."
AmItheAsshole,3aiukr,snuffyboots,1 point,Sat Jun 20 18:37:40 2015 UTC,"Thanks. My husband isn't unreasonable to want things to work out. The biggest issue is his mom isn't reasonable and I am. He can't ask her to be nice, but he knows I will. She is good to the grandkids, so that is why she is in our lives. We have gone months without talking to her in the past because she gets too annoyed with us living our lives. Once she wouldn't talk to us because we wouldn't buy and overpriced house in her neighborhood that didn't fit our needs. That was a quiet six months. We recently looked into building a house and she hated the whole thing and was mad that she didn't get to choose (we decided against that eventually because we didn't like some of the answers we got further in the process, but we did our due diligence to see if it was what we wanted/needed). Her latest issue is that we are thinking about moving two hours away, closer to my parents because our kids love it by the beach. Plus, my parents help out a lot more with the kids. They want to see them and make time with them. My mother in law lives 15 minutes away and only sees them occasionally because she is too busy with her new husband. That's fine, but if we ever have plans (a rare thing) she gets annoyed that we won't cancel for her. She constantly says she is going to take the kids and then cancels at the last minute. Or she only wants our older daughter. Sorry, that shit is getting old too. I get two are difficult, but it isn't right or fair to the kids.   It is messed up, but if she doesn't play nice, I won't let her in my home again. I made sure my husband knows that."

The 24 hour news cycle, the cyclical event,  the eventual debate, I can see how it can be desensitizing.  Maybe saying it doesn't effect you makes you seem selfish, but not necessarily asshole material.  I guess the piece that's more important is how you proceed with this.  Do you have frequent conversations where you boast about not caring about mass murder victims? Do you try to convince others they shouldn't care?  When someone expresses their emotions about it, are you dismissive or belittling?  That's the kind of stuff that would make you an asshole, but honestly I have no idea if you do or not.  Edit: To make this clear, because apparently people are having a hard time with it, the tl;dr is that no, from the info here, the OP is not an asshole."

AmItheAsshole,3ah9wd,horrible-person,7,Sun Jun 21 16:56:39 2015 UTC,"I would say you're not the asshole, and the 5,300+ upvotes for this post would indicate there are others here who might agree, though I recognize that video isn't saying quite the same thing.    According to the CDC, 112 people are going to die today from suicide. 357 will die from unintentional injuries. Over 1600 will die from heart disease, a lot of which will be driven by obesity, smoking, and other preventable issues. Death of all kinds is terrible, but arguably much more could be gained from media attention to these issues than a weeklong cycle devoted to some guy who had a breakdown.    Let's say hypothetically this media onslaught causes us to finally change our ways, provide solid psychological treatment, reasonable gun controls, and society finally heeds the warning signs.  How many lives are we saving? A few dozen a year? I'd rather get serious about saving the 741 people who died in 2013 riding their bikes, as I'm much more likely to personally be this statistic than gunned down by some terrorist.   It's ok not to care about this, because in my mind this isn't the sort of thing that's preventable.  No amount of security at the doors of our schools, airports, or churches is going to really prevent a determined shooter from just shooting the guards and moving into the building.   For about a year I had a very conservative roommate (rando off of craigslist) who got all his news from drudge report and fox. I more or less read the paper and listened to NPR on the way into work.  He would always ask me stuff like ""Did you hear about that girl in Missouri who got kidnapped..."" or other sensational stories that had similarly tragic outcomes.  My response was normally ""no"", because I don't seek that stuff out and generally avoid it even if it's in the paper.  To me it's only news to the people who are directly affected.  Me knowing or caring about that girl isn't doing anything to help her out.  To be clear, I don't think this is a conservative/liberal issue, and MSNBC can be just as bad with these things.    I do agree you can't really make an issue about it though.  This is a good forum for this conversation, but small talk at work, with friends, etc. definitely isn't. There's a very human reaction to these events that none of us can control, and if we're honest, the media plays it up because we watch it.  I don't think it's fair to call people who do care stupid or even wrong, it's just that I don't feel that way.    Edit: clarifying text"

Apathetic would be the better term."
AmItheAsshole,3ah9wd,wobinidan,2,Sat Jun 20 16:56:11 2015 UTC,Yes and no.   You're not an asshole because you're becoming desensitized to the shootings (thought every two weeks is a rather extreme hyperbole). That's just what the media causes. They only focus on the bad and that's all that gets reported so bad becomes the perceived norm and now it's not really that bad in comparison.   You are an asshole because instead of actually trying to remedy the situation you feed into the cycle by coming on here and bitching about it and asking if you're an asshole for not caring.

Cause your friends don't dance and if they don't dance, well, they're no friends of mine.

You've also (perhaps unintentionally) given them an ultimatum, which probably didn't make you very popular.  Try to arrange an outing yourself, and invite who you want, perhaps.

You should handle the thing with your friends differently and just not associate with Fred. Don't try to defend yourself, you two just aren't compatible.

From your writing style, it seems you're pretty dramatic yourself. Your triggering joke was really horrible and you don't seem to want to understand Fred's point of view at all which is something we really try to do on this sub. It's bolded on the sidebar.   A few questions, are all of your other friends vegetarians or has he only told you that you automatically hate animals? Why do they seem to like him but you despise him?  Also triggering has to do with disorders, not disabilities. You say he's ""triggered by everything"" and then say he barks at you for using it which shows me you don't really know how to use that word.   If you still want to see your friends without Fred, just set up meetups without inviting him. Not being near him is your right, but it's your job to avoid him in the end. I had a falling out with a friend and never wanted to talk to him ever again, told my friends such, and found ways to hang out with them without the ex friend.

He seems hypersensitive (defending a made-up relationship as if you told a 9-11 joke or something) and racist (as SJWs tend to be) so I don't think it should be that difficult to talk to your friends and point these things out to them. If they still insist on bringing him around against your wishes, you have your answer.  Maybe a little bit of an asshole for your phrasing but ultimately not the asshole."

One thing we all know about SJWs is that their beliefs are fueled by a sincere longing for social equality and the well being of all people. They are absolutely NOT narcissistic attention seekers who piggyback onto seemingly noble causes to socially signal high moral status. Obviously Fred's quickness to anger and hypersensitivity are caused by his passion, not insecurities and a delicate self image.   So connect with him on that level. He clearly believes strongly in the issue of white privilege. Invite him and your friends to volunteer with you to tutor underprivaleged at-risk young minorities. People with his kind of moral fortitude will have no problem in situations that would make the vast majority of middle class privaleged whites extremely uncomphortable. I'm sure he would find volunteering at youth corrections facilities, homeless shelters, or even rehab centers to be extremely rewarding. You two can bond and your friends will see the kind of person Fred really is."

AmItheAsshole,3abmma,amaresnape,2,Fri Jun 19 10:01:12 2015 UTC,"It doesn't make you an asshole, no. But that doesn't mean I disagree. Goodbyes and closure are important for moving on. I think if you don't say goodbye, you'll regret it. You probably don't think you will, and there's a chance you won't.   But everyone I've known with a story like this has confessed that they wished they'd said goodbye.   I've been cheated on. It's not that terrible over time if you just write it off. I think you should do it for you, and if you're trying to punish her by withholding goodbyes then THAT makes you the asshole."

Even though she cheated on you and it sucks, if you were together that long I think she at least deserves a goodbye. Even if it's just a short one.  Better to do it and say ""well that sucked, but she is gone now"" then have a few months go bye and say ""Man I should have at least said bye""  Just my two cents hope it works out!"

AmItheAsshole,3a8fsi,DrProbably,3,Thu Jun 18 06:45:37 2015 UTC,"Well another way she fucked up is by cancelling our canadian wedding ceremony like a week before it was supposed to happen. My parents and I had put up the money for deposits and rentals etc. we lost 80% of the money. So that sucked.  I had to contact and tell all my relatives what had happened. She, on the other hand, told only her close girl friends. She didn't tell her relatives and even her mom refuses to tell the family. They want to maintain this happy little image of their little girl.. makes me sick."

The thing about the deposit sucks and she should have offered to help soak some of the cost of that. That I'll give you.  Her not wanting to tell her family her own damn business. You ""had to"" tell your family? What does that mean?  Listen man, you're still dodging the question of why she wants out. Do you honestly think she was just bullshitting the whole time to get into Canada or did you guys actually have a falling out? If she's just having doubts about things but doesn't want to leave canada, you'd be kind of an asshole to try to kick her out. If you HONESTLY think she just tricked you to sneak into your homeland, then I'd say go nuts... leagally. Like with lawyers. Lawyer nuts.  Edit: okay welp, just read your edit. Yeah no, go go legal lawyer nuts."
AmItheAsshole,3a8fsi,Diarygirl,1 point,Thu Jun 18 15:56:50 2015 UTC,"I don't know how the immigration process is in Canada, but here in the states, it wouldn't be possible for her to not know she would get deported if she separated from you. She would have had to sign a trillion documents, had a billion meetings about it.  Unless you married a really incredibly stupid person, I'm thinking she knows she's going to get deported.  I still think there's stuff you're holding back, but whatever.  She made her own bed, and when she walked out the door it stopped being your problem.  Not an asshole."

Other that wanting a separation, how is she trying to ruin your life?  I'm not judging either of you yet, just curious.  And I literally know nothing about Canadian immigration law, but if she leaves you, I wouldn't think you're breaking a law, but if the authorities ask you about it, you have to tell them the truth.  And I don't understand the whole three years financial responsibility.  Does that mean you have to pay any debts she might incur?"

AmItheAsshole,3a8fsi,Mustaka,3,Thu Jun 18 14:59:41 2015 UTC,"Regardless of who did what to who and what has happened, there is nothing wrong with divorcing her and having her deported since the only reason Canada wants her to be there is because of you.  There are two exceptions which would make you an asshole:   1) She comes from a country where her life would be in danger if she is deported back there or  2) instead of just separating and informing authorities, you use it to blackmail her in some way."

AmItheAsshole,3a8fsi,kidamy,5,Thu Jun 18 14:59:12 2015 UTC,Kick her to the curb. Tell immigration you are separated and filing for divorce. If you hide it you yourself could get into trouble.  As a Canadian I don't want her in my fine country.

I'm betting that you're not going to find her at the library reading to blind people.  She may already have a little something else going on the side.

AmItheAsshole,3a5c8w,Theboxingmoose,29,Wed Jun 17 10:19:49 2015 UTC,"You're not an asshole for not wanting to cover her shift.  That's what schedules are for, it's their responsibility, not yours.  However, you are an asshole for how you handled it.  If you can cover a shift, say yes.  If you have plans and you can't, say no.  Saying you'd really rather not and to ask everyone else isn't saying no.  It sounds like she did what you asked her to do, then came back because you didn't actually say no.  Then you lashed out at her for assuming you'd do it, which there is no clear indication that she did.  You made a passive aggressive mess out of what should have been a simple ""No.""."
AmItheAsshole,3a5c8w,Funkingthefake,2,Wed Jun 17 15:04:18 2015 UTC,I'd also add that the coworker being free the following day has no bearing on anything. I suppose OP was assuming that they could have scheduled the interview for the day off but that's a giant assumption and chances are they had no say in the matter.
AmItheAsshole,3a5c8w,DrProbably,2,Wed Jun 17 16:52:38 2015 UTC,"Couldn't have said it better than this. As many others are saying, your only mistake was leaving it unclear. I have a similar type of job / scheduling where people are constantly trying to get things covered or swap things around. The important thing to remember is the less you say, the better. Don't explain yourself or even entertain the idea that you OWE anyone an explanation, it only leads to people trying to take advantage more and you can inadvertently look like more of a dick. Either say no or say yes, plain and simple. You don't owe them an apology, but if you'd like to seem more sympathetic you can give the ""Sorry, I'm busy that day, can't do it."" Still a solid no, but a bit softer. That part is up to you. Remember, their schedule is their responsibility. It's on them to ask for days needed ahead of time, and if they wait until the last minute it's only their fault. Obviously things come up, and if you can help them great, but it's not your problem if you can't."

AmItheAsshole,3a5c8w,Funkingthefake,6,Mon Jun 22 08:20:01 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't go so far as to call you an asshole for this, but you didn't communicate effectively.  Your problem is you made it sound like you would do it if you were her last option. ""I'd prefer not to"" makes it sound like you could do it, and could be talked into doing it. (I have made the same mistake before and ended up getting talked into going in anyway.)  A solid ""Sorry, that's not going to work for me"" or ""No, I won't be able to do that"" gets the point across that you can't be talked into it."
AmItheAsshole,3a5c8w,carpe-tenebris,6,Mon Jun 22 08:23:44 2015 UTC,"Protip.  Now that you're an adult, you have the right to say no to things, with out giving reasons why.  Next time something like this happens, just say ""sorry I can't""  and that's it.  Don't go into the whole ""I have plans and blah blah"" .  It gives them something to argue or more fuel to try to plead.  My favorite is personal line is ""I'm not available ony(date).  Period.  Resist the temptation to explain yourself."

I used to be a pushover and take peoples shifts for them all the time and missed out on a lot of fun stuff. Looking back on it I wish I would have just told them to fuck off and deal with it. I know I'm an asshole for saying that, but fuck it, time is valuable."
AmItheAsshole,3a5c8w,Colorado222,3,Wed Jun 17 23:20:54 2015 UTC,"I would say your not the asshole. Covering shifts is a favor in my opinion. If you are scheduled to work then you work.  The only thing I would say is you shouldn't have texted her back at all or you should have been firm in your first response: Coworker: ""Can you cover my shift blah blah..."" You:  ""Sorry but that's my only day off and I need to get some things done.""  This ends the conversation there. You aren't being rude or anything just saying you have a life outside of work. keep in mind that if you cover shifts its more likely to get shifts covered in the future!"
AmItheAsshole,3a5c8w,dnarmasci,1 point,Wed Jun 17 22:30:41 2015 UTC,"So ideally she should have tried to swap her shift to get it instead of asking you?  I mean you have no obligation to help her, her asking you because she needs it is really putting the ball in your court and a lot of pressure, so the fact she's forcing you to feel bad about it actually makes her a bit of an ahole, considering how she reacted. Having said that, you did something good, to help her out, so I find this good Karma, I help people when I can, if I can not, I don't, if they are stuck I try to help them, this is important. I mean you did nothing wrong, so don't worry."
AmItheAsshole,3a5c8w,athanathios,0,Wed Jun 17 21:41:36 2015 UTC,I don't see why she couldn't have just told them that she was free on Friday. That way she wouldn't need anyone to cover her shift and there would be no consequence to anyone else.  I probably was a little harsher than I should have been on her but this isn't the first time I've been put in this situation. I can't really say no when it happens because I could see a potential employer being turned off by someone who organised something with them only to change the plan later that day. So I'd pretty much be costing them the job by saying no.

Her reactions likely were in this vein, however you're right.  You are totally the bigger person and I am the same, my job has a limited number of people that can cover for you, if you can't do it yourself, so we are reliant on each other to cover, so I know how this situation feels. I think it's good Karma to do this, regardless of the other person."

In the hypothetical scenario, of course you're not the asshole. You'd (have had) no sign that he wasn't bullshitting, and you'd obviously be well within your rights, if not your obligations, to follow up on it.  About the only scenario where I could see you being the asshole would be if you cut him off or surreptitiously had the police on the other line before he had the chance to drop the prank, and even that's more a fuzzy line depending on how and how far the joke was drawn out."

It's a hell of a hard place to live, and if you're from a small town in the south it's going to feel really overwhelming.  Just getting by is a struggle, and unless you're loaded, just feeding and housing yourself is going to be your focus for the first year you're there.

It sounds like you must have a good relationship, because among your reasons you want to leave, your mom is not one of them.  You really should not move to NYC from a small southern town.

I now live near Houston and like it much better - all the cultural and digital pluses of a huge city but without the expense and weirdness if NYC.  Honestly, there are better urban centers to move to than NYC - more affordable, less harsh. I strongly suggest a road-trip fact-funding mission before you pick up and move anywhere.  Check out Philly, Pittsburgh, Boston, check out the bigger southern cities (Houston! But also Atlanta, Charleston?) or go west and look at Denver or Portland.

It's not the same thing as black nigger or mexican spic, because nigger and spic already refer to blacks and mexicans by themselves. Trash doesn't refer to white people by itself. If you want a term like that for white people, you have honky, cracker, and gringo, though none of them have the history or hate behind them that nigger or spic do.

I'm not accusing those that use the term of harboring racist sentiment against nonwhites, just that they don't realize what the term really means. It's used as an insult against a white person but in actuality is insulting to every other race by implying that the white person in question is acting apart from the majority of whites."

AmItheAsshole,39uv45,KingPotatoHead,40,Mon Jun 15 00:00:29 2015 UTC,That's an open container violation. Best case scenario is the cop believes you and he lets you go with a warning. Worst is a DUI depending on the state law. This is assuming you're 21 or older. Under 21 is double fucked. You're dad's an dickhead asshole.
AmItheAsshole,39uv45,NorwegianSteam,15,Mon Jun 15 00:11:47 2015 UTC,"Even if it's empty? I was considering that, but I didn't know if it was one with nothing in it.  Also, I'm 20."
AmItheAsshole,39uv45,Have_Mercy,17,Mon Jun 15 00:27:16 2015 UTC,"You can still get an open container violation, but you could beat the dui."
AmItheAsshole,39uv45,l-rs2,8,Mon Jun 15 02:18:17 2015 UTC,"Would beat the dui, right? A breathalyzer test would come up negative."
AmItheAsshole,39uv45,omniamorous,2,Mon Jun 15 07:27:48 2015 UTC,That doesn't matter if there's an open container within reach of the driver
AmItheAsshole,39uv45,l-rs2,3,Mon Jun 15 23:48:13 2015 UTC,O_o But that could be anyone's? So you can pass a breathalyzer (have zero alcohol in your system) and still get a dui on your record because of an empty can on the floor? How does that hold up in court?
AmItheAsshole,39uv45,omniamorous,3,Tue Jun 16 06:06:55 2015 UTC,"It's just how the laws are.  As I said, I can only speak to my state, but Washington is rather strict.    As I understand it, in some states you can have an open cocktail in your cup-holder, as long as it doesn't have a straw; but that may be an old fact or even completely inaccurate, it's just something I've heard."
AmItheAsshole,39uv45,l-rs2,5,Tue Jun 16 17:39:02 2015 UTC,"Interesting and unsettling. I'm coming at this from my Dutch perspective. All that matters here is whether or not a driver is intoxicated, not what might be rolling around on the floor."
AmItheAsshole,39uv45,omniamorous,5,Tue Jun 16 17:51:16 2015 UTC,"Yeah, we really like taking everything to completely unnecessary extremes here in 'Murica (although it's crazy how much the culture and laws vary from state to state).    If you compared Washington to most other states, we're obsessively strict about many things other areas don't care at all about, but are so laid back about things that other states will lose their shit over, like weed use or your sexuality.  It's a crazy country I live in."
AmItheAsshole,39uv45,DrProbably,4,Tue Jun 16 18:19:42 2015 UTC,Consider what that means. People would just chug/dump it if it being empty mattered.
AmItheAsshole,39uv45,TrxpThxm,-2,Mon Jun 15 14:45:27 2015 UTC,"And you're not ""double-fucked"" if you are caught with a beer can under 21.  You'll blow legal and just get hit with an MIP, whoopty-fuckin'-do.  Honestly, I think you're overreacting a bit.  Throw the can away and don't drive drunk anymore from anywhere, prick.  I'd say you're more the asshole than anyone else.  I know everyone makes mistakes, but you make that mistake one too many times you'll end up dead or kill someone else."
AmItheAsshole,39uv45,The_R4ke,5,Mon Jun 15 14:48:34 2015 UTC,"It sounds like it only happened one time and they haven't even drank since then, I think they know they messed up."

AmItheAsshole,39uv45,TrxpThxm,3,Mon Jun 15 16:52:02 2015 UTC,"Just to clarify on that story, it was not my first time drinking, but it was the first time doing so while I could get to my vehicle. I asked my buddies at the party to hold onto my keys, but they just said for me to keep them and they'd beat the shit out of me if I tried to drive off.  Also, I didn't drive until the morning after, and I was the first one to wake up, since I was the first one to blackout, so no one else even saw me try to leave. I didn't know at the time, being stupid as hell, that you could still be drunk the morning after.  It was a major fuckup and I still regret it to this day. As I remember it no one else was even on the roads when I came through (It was a Sunday, so they were all at church), so I just got really lucky."
AmItheAsshole,39uv45,DrProbably,3,Mon Jun 15 22:06:41 2015 UTC,"Yes you did get lucky, coulda ruined your life with that, bud..  I am sure you're a good person and mean well.  I am not trying to lecture you or really scold you... opposite of what my previous comment is trying to convey.

AmItheAsshole,39uv45,TrxpThxm,1 point,Mon Jun 15 18:10:39 2015 UTC,"It depends on the laws in your area, but generally if there's any moisture left, and it's in the main-operating-cab of the vehicle, the cop could give you a DUI for it.  Granted, most wouldn't if it's in a bag, or empty, but at least in Washington they have the authority to use that as evidence.  If it's in the trunk, and therefore out of reach from the driver, you're in the clear.  Otherwise you could just empty the container before they get to your window and claim you were recycling it."
AmItheAsshole,39uv45,NorwegianSteam,0,Mon Jun 15 23:41:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's not the case if it's a crushed can down in the floorboard, sorry, man."
AmItheAsshole,39uv45,TrxpThxm,2,Mon Jun 15 14:46:58 2015 UTC,"It's not an actual DUI, I could have phrased that better. But it can be a giant pain in the ass. I know more than one person that it happened to when they were in high school. One was 18 and he still lost his license for somewhere between 6 and 12 months and had to do some alcohol class. Also on his record."
AmItheAsshole,39uv45,NorwegianSteam,0,Mon Jun 15 16:08:21 2015 UTC,"Sounds like there's more to that story than is being revealed.

I think the rarity of the situation merits that you let it go on good grace. I think the history of such violations of your unspoken rules of what condition to keep your vehicle in should also be taken into consideration, so there are situations I can imagine it appropriate for you to get upset about. Either way however, no damage done, it's over and you can probably just give it up and forgive. Not worth getting really riled up about a near miss, just take the lesson and move on a better person."

When I wrote the sidebar, I was referring to POST voting, not comment voting.  However, /u/zjbird/ is right about site-wide reddiquette as it relates to comments.    I see a lot more OP comments universally downvoted in threads than I think are appropriate, but I don't think this sub should have the ""no-negative-votes"" training wheels put on it, because there are times when downvotes makes sense.  It is possible for an OP to whine like a belligerent jerk if he doesn't like being called the asshole, and if that's the case, let him be downvoted."
AmItheAsshole,39pv5d,DrProbably,1 point,Sat Jun 13 17:49:01 2015 UTC,"Exactly. I'm not saying never to downvote. I'm saying to only downvote things that aren't applicable to the discussion, such as name-calling (unless that name called is ""asshole"")."
AmItheAsshole,39pv5d,flignir,1 point,Sat Jun 13 17:51:25 2015 UTC,"No, you misunderstand. It's standard reddiquette.    Vote. If you think something contributes to conversation, upvote it. If you think it does not contribute to the subreddit it is posted in or is off-topic in a particular community, downvote it.   Which is why I won't downvote you for being wrong because you're still contributing to the topic. You don't need to upvote something you disagree with, but you're not supposed to downvote it simply for the sake of disagreeing."
AmItheAsshole,39pv5d,Funkingthefake,2,Sat Jun 13 17:38:16 2015 UTC,"I would argue that standard reddiquette doesn't apply here*. Asshole status is ultimately determined by the top comment so downvoting is essential to that process.   I won't advocate mass downvoting, downvoting responses just to help your own or even downvoting mostly correct answers, but when some asshole starts telling the OP that he's not an asshole for all that baby-stomping he was doing, then you better believe I'm downvoting that asshole.  *this aspect of it anyhow."
AmItheAsshole,39pv5d,flignir,3,Sat Jun 13 17:49:53 2015 UTC,"This is why it's tricky!  I think general reddiquette can apply, if everyone can be assumed to be fair.  Basically, if we all agreed to only upvote what we agreed with, and only downvote what does not contribute, (which is the standard rule) the top comment would work as a consensus.  I didn't bother to state this in the sidebar because, of course, everyone cannot be assumed to be fair.    I knew there would be a bunch of people who decided to double their vote's strength by inappropriately downvoting everything they disagree with as well as upvoting, so I'm not about to tell the honorable to shoot themselves in foot."

AmItheAsshole,39pv5d,Funkingthefake,-4,Sat Jun 13 18:32:03 2015 UTC,"Nah, you're completely wrong, but I won't downvote you because you're contributing to the conversation. Get over yourself. I get that you don't like me but it doesn't pertain to the point I'm bringing up which is completely valid.  Do you want to complain more? Go ahead. Doesn't pertain to my point, and you clearly are a little butthurt about other comments I've made here, but if it will help you blow off some steam you're more than welcome to."
AmItheAsshole,39oskj,ZadocPaet,29,Sat Jun 13 08:48:21 2015 UTC,"Used to manage a theater and my answer is a maybe. We had special screening times for disabled groups, which I'm not sure is the norm, but sometimes we would have carers bring them into other sessions. The rules for them applied the same as anyone else though which is if you talk in a theater and it interrupts other peoples experience, then you will be asked to leave (after a few warnings of course). While I wouldn't say you're a total asshole in this case since I would technically agree with your points, the fact you didn't go grab an employee to sort it out makes it a bit passive aggressive. The correct response would be to step out for 30 seconds to talk to an employee and within about 3 min that theater would be silent.   That is unless its a mid day screening then you're shit out of luck because there is only 3 people working the entire building until 5."
AmItheAsshole,39oskj,needs28hoursaday,4,Sat Jun 13 11:00:45 2015 UTC,"There's a really good point in there.  If someone you perceived as able bodied was yelling at the movies, you'd go say something to the manager.  But in this case, OP didn't.  The movie theater wasn't showing the guy in the wheelchair preferential treatment, OP was, and then gets salty about it."

They're the kind of people who won't even send food back at a restaurant if it's cold or completely the wrong order because they feel it wouldn't be polite.

Listen, from one asshole to another, being an asshole doesn't always put you in the wrong.   The world needs assholes to keep itself from falling apart. Should the caretaker have brought this loud handicapped person to the movies? Probably not. Are you an asshole for comparing this handicapped individual to an infant and putting it at a lower standard than obnoxious teenage girls? YES! You are! But you're right. It's okay to be right and an asshole. It is my way of life."
AmItheAsshole,39oskj,P13666,6,Sat Jun 13 16:11:58 2015 UTC,"Are you an asshole for comparing this handicapped individual to an infant and putting it at a lower standard than obnoxious teenage girls?   I am not saying the latter is true, but I think in the only difference is that the girls are responsible for their own actions whereas in this case there's another adult responsible. I hadn't considered which is ""worse,"" but in thinking about it I am not sure. On one hand you have  kids who probably should've been accompanied by an adult. In the other you have an adult responsible for the care of an individual.   In the former I honestly don't see a difference. In both of those examples a responsible adult is in charge, and to be honest, the poor fellow's mental faculties aren't probably much more developed than a very young child. Yea, I see it as pretty much the same level of a poor decision by both the caretaker and the parent of a very young child.    It's okay to be right and an asshole. It is my way of life.   Haha, yeah. I can live with that. :)"
AmItheAsshole,39oskj,Ontheneedles,2,Sat Jun 13 18:43:20 2015 UTC,That was beautiful thank you.
AmItheAsshole,39oskj,Dert_,1 point,Sat Jun 13 16:43:10 2015 UTC,"I take special exception to comparing the disabled individual with in infant for two reasons.   For one, the infant will comprehend nothing of the movie. The person you are describing could have cerebral palsy or any number of conditions that affect the body without affecting the mind. Second, infants will eventually grow up and get to see movies in theaters.   A big part about working with disabled individuals is providing as normal an environment as possible. The carer should have picked a place near the back where they wouldn't be as distracting, but obviously the wheelchair would have hindered this."
AmItheAsshole,39oskj,binrobinro,15,Sat Jun 13 20:04:05 2015 UTC,"TL;DR, you're not the asshole but you may want to be careful with your reasoning and not so quick to judge.  I feel like this is one of the few times where I feel I can actually contribute.   My sister has a similar deficiency wherein she can't actually take care of herself on her own - she always needs the care of one of our parents and it will always be that way. We always consider where we are going if and when we go out, not out of embarrassment but because there are certain environments where she is better behaved than others and some may affect other people.   Movie theaters are a perfect example. Whenever she wants to see a movie, my father will make sure the movie is appropriate for her and will try to go on a day and a time when the theater is slower, once again to not provide moviegoers with a similar experience to the one you had.   So yes, I believe it is up to the care of guardian to determine what is and is not appropriate for the person being cared for - that's what makes them their guardian. It slightly sounds like a scenario where the caretaker simply wanted to see the movie and brought the other person with them. However, we don't know the situation and by no means have a right to judge. Maybe going into it, the other person felt enthusiastic about seeing the movie but was overwhelmed in the the theater itself. This could be solved by walking out of the venue and letting them calm down, but once again, we are not to judge the party we know nothing about.   However, one final point I want to make is your reasoning may be a bit unjust. ""Perhaps he enjoys films, but can do so at home."" is a phrase that somewhat irked me. It almost sounds like you're saying people with deficiencies can't go out in public. I understand this is clearly not the point you're trying to make but other people may take more offense to this should it be used in the future.   So no, I don't believe you are the asshole in this situation but we don't quite know the other party's defense to claim that they are the asshole."
AmItheAsshole,39oskj,TheBlackHive,2,Sat Jun 13 14:29:50 2015 UTC,"Perhaps he enjoys films, but can do so at home."" is a phrase that somewhat irked me. It almost sounds like you're saying people with deficiencies can't go out in public.    Not at all. Just that it's disruptive to bring someone with this kind of disability to a place where quiet is expected and where people are paying for an experience. For one adult and one child I paid near $30. My comp tickets don't even cover the format that I was seeing the movie in. There's a level of appropriateness that comes with the responsibility of taking care of a person. If this were a ball game or a park or something I wouldn't have given it a passing thought.   As a parent, there are lots of places I never took my son to when he was younger that I can easily take him to now, and there are lots of places that I still don't take him to now because it's not age appropriate. Do I understand what it feels like when a new movie comes out, you have tickets, and then your sitter cancels? It's very tempting to go anyways, but it's an asshole move to the rest of the audience.   I can sympathize and still decide that the action is wrong. I am also not comparing caring for someone with a disability like this to parenting. It's a much larger level of commitment. Children grow up and develop. They become self-reliant to varying degrees until one day they move out. When caring for someone like this it's a life long thing.   My biggest pet peeve is when parents bring their babies out to the bar at night. Especially when it's right on the smoking patio."

I tell her just let me know and congratulations.   It seems like at the point she told you about it, you had an inkling that you might not be able to go. Since your cousin is in this position of telling you that she's having the wedding and can't invite a lot of people, that is your prime opportunity to say something like ""Cuz, I love ya, but I work 6 days a week and my gf is rarely home, so don't feel pressured to give me an invite""  Again, you're not the asshole, but there is always room for improvement in hindsight."

We can agree to disagree on who the asshole is, I'm just giving my 2 cents in saying that it's of my opinion that OP is more in the wrong by never giving this friend a chance to apologize or talk this through."

Let her be a bitch on her birthday, be upset about it, but don't burn the bridge over it without giving her a chance to explain or apologize. Not only do we not know the whole story, but because she didn't give her a chance to explain, now OP doesn't even know the whole story."
AmItheAsshole,39m7dz,sexadelicfunkbuster,1 point,Sat Jun 13 16:13:33 2015 UTC,I would say you are not the asshole here. Since she was always or almost always making excuses to avoid hanging out with you it seems she didn't really care for you that much.
AmItheAsshole,39k22l,LikeADemonsWhisper,8,Fri Jun 12 07:26:16 2015 UTC,He means well though and it doesn't feel right to raise my voice at someone for trying to be helpful.
AmItheAsshole,39k22l,charliebeanz,3,Fri Jun 12 08:19:36 2015 UTC,"That is a really interesting angle. Thank you, I will give it some thought."
AmItheAsshole,39k22l,synaesthetic,6,Fri Jun 12 08:56:34 2015 UTC,"Naw, I don't think so, especially since he's well aware of why you eat like that and has been explained to him many times.   I've noticed that eating huge, unhealthy meals seems to be a thing a lot of guys are like... proud of? Like, it's a weird sign of masculinity I guess. Hardly ever see men eating salads or small, healthy meals. Maybe that's why he's doing it? He's just teasing you?"
AmItheAsshole,39k22l,pharmasweaves,3,Fri Jun 12 09:29:22 2015 UTC,"It is partially teasing which I am often a good sport about, but there is always a sincerity to it and in this instance I just wasn't in the mood to explain my habits yet again. It is forgetfulness on his part but I can't help but feel disrespected needing to remind him each time after the 7 years we have known each other that he can't remember my biggest insecurity."
AmItheAsshole,39k22l,Funkingthefake,4,Fri Jun 12 10:16:20 2015 UTC,I know how annoying it is when people tell you about food. I have food intolerances and allergies and people try to give me advice. I snap sometimes too.
AmItheAsshole,39k22l,_Gwink_,3,Fri Jun 12 08:41:36 2015 UTC,"Absolutely not the asshole here.  He has been berating you for what sounds like a long time over the same thing even though you have told him why you do it, and you finally had enough and told him off. It sounds more like he was snapping at you because he has bad eating habits."
AmItheAsshole,39k22l,Diarygirl,2,Fri Jun 12 08:52:26 2015 UTC,"Nah. You're not an asshole.  Although, maybe next time say something before it gets to the point that you blow your top?"
AmItheAsshole,39k22l,Diarygirl,2,Fri Jun 12 11:23:44 2015 UTC,"Not the asshole at all. I would guess his obsession with what you eat stems more from his own insecurity over his diet and control. that can often project itself trying to get you up/on his level so that he does not have to feel as bad. I've been on both sides of the fence as the one having a bag of candy not being very understanding of people that can't just devour sweets like that not being very respectful of their decision to on the other hand staying away from it all and seeing how others really look at you strangely when you and your food habits stand out. My final thought - keep at your healthy eating, if he can't hack it, he should look more to himself."

Eating with other people can be such a chore sometimes.  I get a lot of grief, mostly from my family.  They're always like ""Oh, you have to eat more than that"" or ""Do you even weight 100 pounds?""  Yes, 115.  Some people think I have an eating disorder, and sometimes that's better than telling the truth.  I agree with the other poster that said he's got issues, and you probably hit him where it hurts, but that's understandable when someone keeps harping on you like that.  What's happened since then?  Are you talking?  Also, maple bacon on pancakes with ice cream is not what a healthy person eats for breakfast."

Aside from that, you haven't provided much context to go by so all I have at this point are questions.  Did you promise anything to these people?  Did you convince others to join you in the beginning?  What do you mean by the start up problems? Do you think the project is doomed with or without you or do you just not like how certain people are doing things?  I need more info."
AmItheAsshole,39juw5,DrProbably,2,Fri Jun 12 06:24:23 2015 UTC,"You're right, not my first language. But I'd always believed I'm good at english. Thanks for pointing it out though, I'll look things up. For the promise, it was understood I'll be dealing with the technology since the time we began, so it was sort of taken for granted I'll be leading the design part. I didn't convince, I was just available (and lost) when they were 'starting up'. By startup problems, I mean those typical ones you find on the web. See, we're not in the silicon valley, so good programmers are hard to find. Harder to find are managers and those with good software engineering skills. So we have no managers. I'm of a belief that if we're to create something of a value, it must come up with solutions unique to the problem, so I sit down and do design and build things which fit well on my part. And I'm unable to get the team to do it on their work, so I have to sit down again and try and do it for them and make them understand the deal. I understand I can't always be right with design, but the gap of communication and understanding is just apparent, something I never felt at my previous employment. And this leaves me with no time to study my own stuff. So I'm just worried of letting another year go by."
AmItheAsshole,39juw5,DrProbably,2,Fri Jun 12 06:48:32 2015 UTC,"Your english isn't bad per se, you just have a lot of run-ons and fragments. It seems like you're trying to summarize too much, too fast. The use of vague pronouns isn't helping either, but I digress.  It just sounds like too much of the work is falling to you and others aren't pulling their weight. If you jump ship with no notice, yeah that would make you an asshole.   This isn't exactly an advice sub but I would recommend that you bring up your issues with HR (or whatever equivalent you have) instead of just leaving. Tell them that you have doubts about the project overall and that too much is being asked of you. If you're as essential as you say, then you should be given some help. If they can't provide any support and things keep degenerating then I would say that you can jump ship without guilt."

I did make some minor changes though. Thanks for pointing out.  As for going to the HR, who apparently is our investor, he wants a complete product before he can invest more to hire. By complete product means 90% and ready to launch. The current team is less that the no. of fingers on a hand. And I didn't mention we were being paid unlike typical startups, did I! Although it's a paltry sum considering our market worth, we are being paid. We are also promised shares, but you can guess the bite."

You got pulled into a project, put yourself into it, and at this point have decided that it's not in your best interest to continue. It also sounds like you haven't been given proper tools to even finish the project in the first place, sub-par colleagues, rude management, and so on. So long as you aren't leaving suddenly and without telling your team members, you are in the clear.

If you just say, ""hey you guys, I'm leaving next week so deal with it,"" you'll be an asshole.  This isn't a regular job, it's something you helped create, that your friends are kind of depending on, that you have assumed a huge role in.

Management is to blame and if your coworker friends can't see that you deserve to focus on what's  best for you, then they are the assholes.  Your leaving is management's  problem, not your friend's.  If you want to be nice, state your concerns as high up (boss' boss) as you can and give them a few week's notice... but once you decide to quit, do not entertain counter offers that don't address the root problems.  Startups are notorious for exploiting hard workers, getting sold, and the new company fires the old employees.  At least in the USA, the owner knows his real product is to sell the entire company and he doesn't care about you or the effectiveness of the actual product.  If everyone stayed at an abusive company just because they had friends there, everyone would be burnt out by now."

Both of you wanted something from the other that you weren't willing to accept.  Yeah, it looks like you're both hypocrites here.  It seems like she was fine with the arrangement until it didn't work in her favor, and it seems like you hated the arrangement until it worked out for you.  Yep. Both assholes."
AmItheAsshole,39hpdg,Funkingthefake,6,Thu Jun 11 20:21:31 2015 UTC,"I disagree. I think girl 1 had completely unrealistic expectations which caused him to jump ship and she is a fool for being upset with him for doing what any reasonable person would do in the situation.  The only thing I would do differently is not get involved in arguments with her during the relationship - just creates trouble for no good reason.  I think she is completely selfish - not holding herself to a monogamous standard, then getting upset at op for not being monogamous - and telling him that he is a hypocrite. That's a but much. I'm willing to contemplate that op's conduct has been less than perfect possibly - we only have his perspective and that always makes it hard to judge - but if she is the type to get angry at op when he shows her romantic gestures like getting her flowers - in my mind that's not ""two people having incompatible needs"", rather it's ""one person having reasonable expectations and the other being a horrible cunt""."

AmItheAsshole,39hpdg,Funkingthefake,4,Fri Jun 12 02:02:09 2015 UTC,"Well, it's one thing to dislike flowers, but it's a whole other thing to start an argument over them when given as a gift. /u/internetalerego is just calling it as they (and most people) see it."
AmItheAsshole,39hpdg,Hunterogz,0,Fri Jun 12 02:21:06 2015 UTC,"We have no idea as to the exact context and execution of said gift of flowers and to assume fault either way just shows your bias.   I mean you're probably right but assuming that OP is totally blameless and accurately representing ""starting an argument"" is a bit trusting. She may have just told him she didn't appreciate that kind of thing and he got super offended. Maybe he sent them to her work and embarrassed her. World of possibilities."
AmItheAsshole,39hpdg,DrProbably,5,Fri Jun 12 06:41:02 2015 UTC,"Im not blameless by any means but the flowers were her overreacting, honestly. I picked her up for the date, presented flowers, boom- argument about how romance is sexist and Im conforming to gender roles and bla bla bla."

AmItheAsshole,39hpdg,ArtGoftheHunt,7,Thu Jun 11 23:30:47 2015 UTC,"So, while she wanted an open relationship, she ultimately agreed to let you know if there's another guy, so you can choose to end the relationship. You reconnect with an old friend/acquaintance and want to date her, so you tell your gf, but don't break up with her. Did I read that right? If so, then yes you're the asshole because that's completely hypocritical. Your gf may have avoided relationships because she wanted to be with you and then you turn around and propose an open  relationship when you benefit. She may be a crazy bitch, but you're the asshole here."

AmItheAsshole,39hpdg,ArtGoftheHunt,1 point,Thu Jun 11 21:01:39 2015 UTC,"No I understood that you didn't cheat. You're a hypocrite because you said that you weren't ok with an open relationship, but then you turned around and proposed an open relationship when the opportunity suited you. She may have passed on other relationships because you supposedly would have left under those circumstances. She chose you over other guys (when apparently she didn't have to) because you were supposedly against an open relationship.        Edit: clarification"

AmItheAsshole,39hpdg,ArtGoftheHunt,9,Thu Jun 11 21:39:24 2015 UTC,It's not an open relationship if you plan on leaving the second she gets with another guy.

This was a relationship that stayed where it belonged, without investing to much energy. This girl definitely has her own baggage and ideas that prevent her from actually getting close to someone. Second you were right to persue someone else in the meantime since this wasn't really a girl you were 'Dating'. As a person you deserve to find someone you want to actually have a relationship with. Judging by her idea she would have slept with others without telling you until you talked to her about it.  Needless to say neither of you are assholes, you both stated what you wanted out of whatever it was you had. My preference she was hurt because you proved to her that you weren't going to put her ahead of anyone else."

Now, correct me if I'm interpreting this incorrectly, but I want to try to define what I think went on here.   It sounds like you were in this really ambiguously defined relationship where no one pledged any commitment. She wants to have an open relationship, which you say no to. Once that option is gone, she talks about how it's her body and she'll do what she wants with it to leave her an out if she ever wants to bang someone else/stop dating you, which is fine because there's no commitment. When you tell her that you're seeing someone else, she has a reaction that makes it sound like she wanted to hold you to a committed relationship despite it being clearly stated on her part that she didn't want that. She then tries to turn it around on you and call you a hypocrite because you initially stated that you wanted a commitment, despite the fact that no commitment was ever made. If no commitment is made, then she can't call you a hypocrite for not living up to that nonexistent commitment. She's purposefully muddying the waters so that she can remain blameless, and all the blame can go to you in her mind.   It's some crazy, egotistical, manipulative bullshit, and that makes me think that she's the asshole here. It sounds like you made every effort to define the boundaries of the relationship, and she refused to define anything, and then used that ambiguity against you to defend her own ego when she didn't get what she wanted.   My vote: You're not the asshole."

Even if you feel like you are ignored by your mother's boyfriend and other kids, it was a family dinner, so your sister would have still been there to talk to.

AmItheAsshole,39gekp,ImNoHero,16,Thu Jun 11 15:27:56 2015 UTC,"You're not an asshole. You pay rent, and with that rent comes a reasonable expectation of privacy.  Having someone come through your space anytime they want is kind of shitty, and in a lot of places not legal.  Your neighbor probably isn't happy about this either, her privacy is compromised as well."
AmItheAsshole,39gekp,Funkingthefake,11,Thu Jun 11 17:23:56 2015 UTC,"I don't think you're being too much of an asshole, but you should work harder to make a compromise. Maybe have cheaper rent for the month, or make the landlord make and give them copies of the keys they would need as well as set up a hallway with curtains to allow them through. Some sort of compromise would make you less of an asshole, not that you're being a major one."
AmItheAsshole,39gekp,zjbird,9,Thu Jun 11 16:14:39 2015 UTC,"Cheaper rent for the month would seal the deal with me but my landlord has said a firm ""No."" Trying to compromise here.

AmItheAsshole,39gekp,zjbird,21,Thu Jun 11 16:53:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah it sounds kind of like he's the asshole, despite what most people here are saying. To have a signed lease and suddenly tell someone they need to let other people into their private home for 3 weeks without any sort of anything in it for you is a bit douchey."

If you're upstairs and she's downstairs, does that mean she will have to go up steps to get to her downstairs apartment?  Maybe someone could draw a map.  The other thing that jumps out at me is, what kind of patio takes three weeks to build?  Assuming they work only weekdays, that's still 15 days of work."

It's possible to walk through my place, then down to her place, which is what the landlord is proposing.  I agree about the time frame but I also don't know enough about constructing a patio to dispute it... I've said that I'd be fine up to a week or so but three weeks of neighbors (and whomever they have with them) having keys, coming and going, any time of day seems a bit much. I can't imagine ever having to go to a neighbor and tell them that I have to walk through their house every day for a month because of some construction. My opinion on the situation is clear in the initial post but I just think it's a ridiculous request."

The labor alone has to be pretty expensive.  Wondering if he's thinking of selling the place in the future, but it seems like he'll definitely raise your rent when you renew your lease."
AmItheAsshole,39gekp,AlcoholicSpaceNinja,9,Thu Jun 11 17:46:27 2015 UTC,"Totally a maneuver to sell.  Landlords don't typically wake up in the morning and think, ""how can I make my tenants' barbeques more pleasant?"

What she thinks and does in the future is of no concern to you. Making your stance on the issue known doesn't make you an asshole necessarily but now that the conversation is over, it's over. Unless she brings it up again you'd be the asshole to not let it go. Crazy gonna craze. Oh, and don't go telling others that she isn't a virgin. That's needlessly petty and also makes you an asshole.

Even if both parties consent at the time or both parties are under age.  The idea is that young kids are too young to make such important decisions for themselves.  My guess is the law was written to protect kids who are pressured into sex with much older folks.  Whether you agree with it or not, it's the law and going on the sex offender registry destroys lives."

Virginity is when a person has never participated in sexual intercourse. That's the purely physical definition. The term also refers to other forms of sexual acts based on emotional value. Example: a heterosexual couple may consider vaginal sex to have the most emotion attached to it, so that would be concidered losing virginity, while a gay couple may have an equal emotionaly attachment to anal or oral sex, so that would be considered losing virginity to them.          Edit: hymens can tear, but they don't break or pop. They're still there and intact after the first, second, tenth time you have sex. Tearing has nothing to do with virginity. http://www.medicaldaily.com/pop-your-cherry-myth-false-hymens-stretched-open-not-broken-271196"

AmItheAsshole,398q96,zjbird,5,Wed Jun 10 01:53:49 2015 UTC,"It was a unique situation, in all my years I've not been in a similar one. They didn't say that he had told them to give them the change, or to tip me a certain amount. I would have probably just handed it over if they did, I was uncomfortable with it as it was. I do promise that I've told the whole truth, the guy who handed over the money didn't say anything to me apart from what I've written.

AmItheAsshole,398q96,MaddPony,2,Wed Jun 10 02:25:18 2015 UTC,"My mom used to be a cab driver (In the US) and people gave her a $20 for small calls all the time, it may be charity but it's fairly common, like at least twice a month it happened to her.  Around christmas time sometimes people would give her $50 or $100 for small calls."
AmItheAsshole,398q96,bilscuits,8,Mon Jun 22 21:53:17 2015 UTC,"No way, he was a business man and didnt give a shit about the change. They were just assholes for wanting the money when they should have just let it go. God knows what ""take care of them"" means. Maybe just being polite, like he meant it non-literally(like when people say ""hi, how are you"" ""I'm fine thanks"" it's non-literal. It's just a social protocol)"
AmItheAsshole,398q96,_Gwink_,7,Wed Jun 10 06:37:26 2015 UTC,"I don't think you're the asshole here at all. If he wanted them to get change back, he would have given one of them £20 and had them pay you. He didn't, though, he paid you £20 to provide a service and walked away. The people you were driving didn't pay you anything, so there was no change to give them."
AmItheAsshole,398q96,ArtGoftheHunt,7,Wed Jun 10 13:22:15 2015 UTC,"First off, you are not the asshole. But there is something to consider; The key information here is the relationship between the person paying for the fair and the people getting in the cab. If a friend of yours would pay the cab and ask you to get in, you would never assume the money that your friend payed belonged to you unless specifically instructed to do so and even less so in a party of people, and if you as the driver never received any such instructions then that is their bad. If it would be your parent paying the cab on the other hand, you would first off have a different relationship to the money and more reason to ""believe"" that it in essence was yours to claim, but still - without stating it to the person you hand the money to that term is not a part of the agreement you just made. Could you have been a very nice guy, yes, should you? I wouldn't. you performed the task you where payed for, and i bet you got them there with excellent service."
AmItheAsshole,398q96,sandra_nz,3,Wed Jun 10 16:13:31 2015 UTC,"Great comment, thanks. The relationship issue to the money is one my SO brought up when I discussed it with her. For instance if my mother had paid for the taxi would I feel like I was entitled to the change. It's a good point but I don't believe that I would have asked for the change if I was in the same situation as the people in my car. I usually would be 'a very nice guy' and go against whatever I believed to be right to bring the situation to a friendly close, but I decided this time that I wasn't for doing that. I kinda surprised myself while I was doing it."
AmItheAsshole,398q96,dcb720,1 point,Wed Jun 10 17:15:21 2015 UTC,"I've only ever taken a cab once, but to my memory usually people pay at the destination because that's when the price is finalized. Even though you gave the price up front, wouldn't the man paying for the cab ride have to give you extra money in case something comes up and the ride ends up costing more? I think getting a 600% tip is a little off to say the least. I don't think that was intended as a tip. I mean why would three employees fight, so hard for £16.50 unless they felt slighted or their boss was expecting change?           While the buisness man should have given clear instructions, I'm going to go against the grain here and say yes. I think you're an asshole because you decided that your initial conclusion (the extra money is the tip) was correct despite evidence to the contrary."
AmItheAsshole,398q96,sandra_nz,0,Wed Jun 10 23:50:09 2015 UTC,"Here's my thoughts, but bear in mind this is coming from the perspective of someone who doesn't live in the same tipping culture as you.  I actually think you were the asshole here.   There was a misunderstanding and this was made clear to you when they asked for the change and continued to insist on the change. As you say, it was a very short journey, but you then lengthened it by 10 minutes by standing your ground and arguing with them about the tip.  As you said, this was most likely an employer paying for his employees. They were most likely panicking at what was going to happen to them in the workplace when they had to tell their employer that there was no change provided, wondering if this situation might get them fired or they might be asked to provide the money out of their own pockets. All because you made an assumption rather than were given an explicit 'Here, I'll give you $20 to get them back safe and sound.'  I think it was fine of you to assume that the $20 was intended to be yours.

AmItheAsshole,398ydf,zjbird,13,Wed Jun 10 15:23:43 2015 UTC,"Totally not an asshole but I don't agree with all of your post.  Where there is a disabled toilet stall in a bathroom, disabled people have priority to use that toilet. So if there is a queue of five people waiting and a disabled person enters, they get to use the disabled toilet as soon as it is free, ahead of the five people waiting. It's not ""for the exclusive use of disabled people"", which so many people seem to think it is!  Here's where I disagree with you though - the reason why the disabled person should not be expected to wait for the five people first is that their disability may mean that it takes them a lot longer to get 'set up' to use the facilities, so you don't make them wait in the queue as that adds even more time."
AmItheAsshole,398ydf,sandra_nz,6,Wed Jun 10 05:50:10 2015 UTC,For my part I do not hesitate to use disabled restrooms as long as no one is waiting for them.
AmItheAsshole,398ydf,whaleyboy1000,4,Wed Jun 10 03:30:07 2015 UTC,"I think people are confusing handicapped parking with handicapped stalls by assuming both are there to expedite the process for the disabled. This is not the case.  Handicapped parking is closer to the door because ambulation isn't super easy for everyone so it makes sense to have the door closer for them so they have to walk less, so those spaces are reserved.  Handicapped stalls are larger because some people need the extra space/hand holds to be able to get the job done without any undue constrictions, so those stalls are built. They aren't reserved and they're not there simply for the use of the handicapped. Their existence is all that's nessesary, if and when a handicapped person needs them.  The time it takes for a handicapped person to go/making them wait longer have nothing to do with it. Sure it would be the polite thing to allow a handicapped person to use the facilities before you but you can hardly be expected to not use the stall on the off chance a handicapped person comes by.  No OP, you're not an asshole."

So long as you use the regular bathrooms when available, I think using the handicap bathroom is fine. I also think, though, that if you notice anyone who may need to use it in visual range before you go in, you should continue the search.  I just hope no one compares this to parking and says ""well then I can park in a handicap space if everything else is taken."""

AmItheAsshole,398ydf,bluecompton,0,Sat Jun 27 23:02:07 2015 UTC,"Kind of. For a start, how do you know that a person doesn't have a disability that would require urgent bathroom access? Also, it probably takes a person with a disability longer to find a restroom they can use, and longer to use it once they've found it. If the queue for the disabled toilet is long, it's not like they can just use the regular restroom. And if everyone did it, it would become much more of a problem. Sure, a lot of the time, it won't be a big problem, but there's a good chance that eventually this practice will cause a problem for someone whose life is tough enough as it is. That day, you're going to feel like a bit of am asshole."

I've noticed, even in a city where every other car has a placard, the number of people who actually need an accessible bathroom stall is pretty small. Unless it's a disability-related event. That said, people less buggered-up than my husband, who actually need to semi-undress and transfer to the seat, they may need all the lead time they can get. So if you're in the big stall, do your thing and get out. Don't sit there redditing on your phone."

Not saying that this guy is for sure, but no reason to get all pissy at them for saying it.  But back to the original question, the higher density area you live in the less common pleasantries are.

AmItheAsshole,3960uu,ctlx,7,Wed Jun 10 09:39:58 2015 UTC,"Sorry it took so long for me to reply, you'll probably be the only person to read this now haha. Oh well!  Welp, at the beginning of my sophomore year of college, I joined a sports club on campus. Now this club would go to other schools for tournaments and such so I thought to meet people in the club I would go to some and throw my introverted self out there. At a tournament in September, this girl, we'll call her Susan, was on my team and we talked to each other all day, seemed like a cool person. After the tournament I went to add her on Facebook and message her maybe to get to know her a little more. I see she has a boyfriend so I think ""damn, oh well I'll just be friends with her then"". So that's just what we became, we always practiced with each other and every now and again would text each other just as friends would. Then it started getting to winter time (early November I'd say) and after one of the practices, the team wanted to go to Denny's for hot food and cocoa (we practiced at nights). For some reason everyone dropped out last second and I was still there practicing with Susan. Now damnit, I really wanted some hot chocolate and the team not going wasn't going to stop me. So I ask Susan to go get some cocoa with me (not a date or anything, just hanging out). So we go to this local coffee shop and we stay for like 4 hours chatting away. We end up repeating this same venture another 6 or 7 times, going to the coffee shop after practice and staying until closing time at 2AM. It was during that time I started liking her but I knew she was dating someone so I didn't ever push anything. The last time we went, right before Thanksgiving break, she said she wanted to go on a drive. So we ended up driving to this lake outside the town and sitting on the lakeside, stupid me kept thinking there was nothing romantic going on but I wanted the night to keep going because I was having a lot of fun with her. Then she turns to me and said she wanted to watch a movie. It was about 3AM at this time, so I told her there was nowhere open to watch a movie to which she replied, ""Do you have any roommates?"" Now you can probably guess where this is going, and again naive me refused to look into the situation and think it was about to get really bad really fast. I had my own room on campus so I told her my place was available and we went there. Started playing Princess Bride (classic movie, will forever be ruined for me now) and about halfway through she starts making out with me and I go with it because I liked her and just said screw it. Did stuff for most of the night and she sleeps over. In the morning I come to my senses and make her fess up about what's going on. Turns out her boyfriend, we'll call him Todd, is in basic training for the marines at a camp out of state. They've been dating for 4 years but she claims that she's hasn't been able to talk to him a lot during his training and that she's been waiting to see him in person to break up with him. Hearing this, I feel what we did wasn't that bad anymore and we continue seeing each other and such. A week later he comes back home and she goes to break up with him. To ""make the breakup easier"" she told him about me and stuff we did (at this point I'm like ""holy shit I'm a dead man""). Dude gets pissed but refuses to break up with her, she ends up not being able to. When she tells me that, I tell her I definitely don't feel comfortable with the situation anymore and unless she breaks up with him, I'm out. So, that's just what she does. Cuts it clean off with Todd, Todd actually ends up punching a hole in the wall (guy is a bit unstable). So it seems like the controversial stuff is out of the way and Susan and I are dating then. Told my friends the whole situation, to which they rightfully bitched me out about helping a girl cheat but they would support me as friends still while giving warning about the chances that she'll also cheat on me.  Winter break comes along (Todd and her are from same hometown, I live in a different city), Susan starts not responding to my texts and calls until she messages me ""we need to talk"". I know what that means, she calls me, promptly says ""Ragelikecage, I'm not ready to date you right now, I'm going to give Todd another chance."" I pretty much say ""k"" and spend the rest of break brooding over it and really resenting her for what she did. But hey! Here comes part 2 to the story!!!  Spring semester begins, I get an internship in another city so I take the semester off of college while Susan is still there (nothing to do with Susan, I got the internship while we were ""dating""). Susan texts me one weekend asking for her stuff back that I had. So I go down to the college (only like 2 hours away so not a big deal) and I make up this speech in my head to just bitch her out for what she did and how I felt about her and how she was not only hurting me but Todd since she obviously couldn't be faithful and didn't respect that relationship. Now, it's really hard for me to be mean to people especially in person, so when I see her I pretty much keep my mouth shut. We sit on a bench and she ends up saying she still has feelings for me. I respond, ""I still have feelings for you too."" I really despised her over winter break but that didn't stop me from still liking her inside I guess. She then tells me the reason she got back with Todd was because he was threatening to do stuff to himself if she didn't, why she couldn't tell me that at the time I have no idea. Anyways, she wants to get back with me but can't break up with him at the moment because she didn't feel he was stable enough to go through that yet. With this, I tell her that while I liked her still, I couldn't wait on her forever, and that was about it.  2 days later, literally 48 hours after she says she didn't think Todd was stable enough to go single, she calls me and tells me she broke up with him. As ridiculous as this has been, I go see her the next week and we get back together. From about mid-January to mid-March we dated and we were having a blast and everything was going great. No drama! But for me, that never lasts for long. Sure enough, during spring break we get in this small argument I can't remember what about, one of those arguments that is common for couples and shouldn't be a big deal. She ends up calling me a few days later and says ""Ragelikecage, I don't see a future between us, I think we should break up."" At that point I'm in wtf mode and that whole speech I prepared when I was going to see her after winter break came back to my mind and boy I let her have it. After that, she deleted me and all my friends she met off of Facebook, Snapchat, Instagram, any social media really so I didn't know anything she was up to after that. A couple weeks later, early April, I go down to the college for an event for the sports club I joined where I originally met Susan. One of my friends there was catching up with me and said, ""Hey! Did you hear about Susan?"" Since she deleted me off of social media, I said no. To which my friend said, ""Oh, well she and Todd got back together!"" I kinda expected this to happen so I wasn't that shocked but the fact it still happened still kinda pissed me off. Especially when I learn that they were still best buds when she broke up with him in January and that they still hung out. And even more especially when I'm told that there was more than likely more stuff going on than ""hanging out"".  So yeah, hope you enjoyed a slice of drama in life. Thanks for reading, I'm fully aware of the faults I had. Really, all I can do now is use this as an experience to warn others not to do it and to tell myself never to get into stupid stuff like that again.  Tl;dr: Like girl, girl has bf, become friends, girl makes move on me and we date, she breaks up with bf, breaks up with me, gets back with bf, breaks up with bf, gets back with me, breaks up with me, gets back with bf, find out she was more thank likely cheating on me during time she dated me"

What a disgusting point of view to hold. We're all humans and if we don't care about each other then the world is gonna fall to shit. What kind of person says something like that?    It's not his promise to keep.   This is also a horrible thing to say. I haven't made a promise to my local bank that I won't rob it, but I am certainly aware that it's a bad thing to do and therefore I won't do it. Since when does someone have to promise that they won't do a shitty thing to another person? And since when does the nonexistence of such a promise give you free reign to do whatever the hell you want, no matter who it hurts in the process?  Life is not a free-for-all.

He's a human being with feelings too, and what you should be doing is letting them work out whatever problem exists first, then you can swoop in after they're broken up or whatever. All you're doing is adding one more problem and forcing them apart whether they want to or not. Can you honestly say you would stop if they work it out and stay together?"

(a) If he stepped back, that wouldn't eliminate the billions of other guys she might go after, and (b) if the girlfriend involved were interested in working things out, she wouldn't be seeking him out for sex, and he wouldn't have any say.  If two people want to be in a relationship, it's their job to overcome the challenge of fidelity.  In essense, I have an agreement with my girlfriend not to sleep with other people.  I don't have an agreement with every man on the planet not to try to sleep with her."

Like guys looking for sex, water is going to do what it's going to do.  You can't say the water is wrong for not magically evaporating, and you can't say all guys need to immediately refuse her advances because her boyfriend wants them to.  It's up to her to be faithful.  Likewise, if your sink is clogged, you remove the clog; you don't sulk around the house and curse the water."

AmItheAsshole,3960uu,flignir,-6,Tue Jun 9 18:27:28 2015 UTC,"Mostly because it's fun to discuss this topic. There are many opinions, many views, maybe someone comments something that makes me change my mind. That's a hard thing to do, because I'm quite stubborn and I always have the answer: ""well, they don't know the exact situation"" but maybe someone achieves it nevertheless."
AmItheAsshole,3960uu,Zulban,6,Tue Jun 9 18:42:05 2015 UTC,"You should care because for all you know you could be ruining this other guy's life. To say their relationship is just broken or heavily damaged is only one possibility, he could be a great guy and she's just a fuckwad. If you have any sense of decency you know it's an assholeish thing to contribute to her shitty behavior and possibly ruin some guy's life behind his back. You don't have nearly enough information to try to twist this in your favor, and under no circumstances is what she's doing okay. If she's not satisfied with her relationship she needs to end it. If for some reason she CAN'T, she has bigger problems to worry about than another guy to fuck on the side."

I mean, I don't know him, I don't know any details about their relationship and I'm not the one who is forcing this. Is the pure knowledge of a relationship enough to be the asshole? Why should I care? Who says I have to look after somebody else's relationship?"
AmItheAsshole,3960uu,izziev,26,Tue Jun 9 15:05:58 2015 UTC,The fact that you know she is in a relationship should be enough for you to back off. How would you feel if you were in her boyfriend's shoes?  Not knowing him personally is a weak excuse for selfish behavior. You're trying to separate yourself from blame with those thoughts.
AmItheAsshole,3960uu,G_Rex,1 point,Tue Jun 9 15:25:38 2015 UTC,"To be fair, if you were ﻿the boyfriend and heard about ﻿the first incident, would it really change how you felt about ﻿the situation if he did/not stop when finding out?  The fundamental trust of ﻿the relationship is broken either way, trying to soften ﻿the blow, at least at the first incident won't change much in that sense.   Not to say OP isn't guilty, just a point of perspective."

AmItheAsshole,3960uu,headless_bourgeoisie,12,Tue Jun 9 15:31:28 2015 UTC,"You should care because you're ruining the relationship of two humans. Sure, you might not be the only cause, and yeah, there could be existing problems with their relationship, but that doesn't change the fact that you and your actions with this girl are actively hurting this boyfriend, whether he knows it or not. Even though you don't know him, he's a human being and you should empathize with him. The fact that you don't care at all and you feel like you don't need to just makes you a bigger asshole."

Even before we hooked up, it wasn't important anymore. Their relationship should have ended the instant she went for the kiss, or before, I don't know. It would be the best thing if she told him about it, that's true. I can't do that, I can only not meet her again and I could try to make her feel guilty so that she says something to him but bloody hell, I'm having fun, she is an adult with her own mind. Their relationship is over either way, I think it's not okay that she says nothing but this time, I won't judge."

AmItheAsshole,3960uu,ignayshus,4,Wed Jun 10 05:41:30 2015 UTC,"You don't have to care. But you should know that with the knowledge you have you are a complete asshole and utterly disrespectful to another person. Yes she flirted with you, but as soon as you found out that she had a boyfriend and you flirted back you became the asshole too. Would you flirt with some other girl (who didn't start flirting with you first) if you knew she had a boyfriend? I don't think so, because you know that this is very disrespectful and very assholeish move. Seems like you don't know anything about the relationship, besides that she must not be happy with the guy. But because you know that she has a boyfriend you are an accomplice in making some guys life miserable by helping the girlfriend lie to him and deceive him in the relationship. So yes you are an asshole. :)"
AmItheAsshole,3960uu,notapantsday,7,Tue Jun 9 18:43:25 2015 UTC,"But why, why should I care?   This is why you're an asshole. You are willingly participating in an action that causes harm to another person for a few moments of pleasure. You are thinking only of yourself and not about those that may get hurt by your actions (you know, like an asshole would)."
AmItheAsshole,3960uu,shawncoons,3,Tue Jun 9 16:02:37 2015 UTC,"You should care because it's called being a decent human being. Everyone is saying ""What if you were in his shoes?"" But I disagree with that viewpoint... It's not just about being in his shoes because you obviously don't care.  At this point, you are contributing to the general assholeness of society. What if, 2-5 years in the future you meet your dream girl etc etc, everything is going great, and she finds out about how this once happened, decides she doesn't like your moral fiber, and leaves?  If this something you feel like you should be proud of? It's not the same as guiltily eating another piece of cake or spending too much money on a game. You are in a chain reaction of multiple peoples lives, and your guilty pleasure could easily result in a broken heart. Yes, she is an asshole here(a LOT more so than you). But you dirty yourself by continuing to participate in this relationship with her.  That being said, you are an asshole. She is more of an asshole, but that doesn't make you clean.   Lastly, to answer your question: Why should I care for something which is obviously broken or at least heavily damaged?   If you REALLY want to know more about this, research it. ""Why do women cheat?"" You know, at this point that something is making her want to cheat. It may not be the boyfriend at all, and it's very possible that if it wasn't with you, it would be with someone else. If I would you, I would sit and think long and hard about if this is the kind of person you want to be."
AmItheAsshole,3960uu,Kiltmanenator,7,Tue Jun 9 15:50:02 2015 UTC,"Basic human decency?  You're blaming them for having a ""broken"" relationship (even after stating that you know nothing about their relationship) instead of admitting that your actions are clearly perpetuating the problems that they may have. Both you and the girl are assholes and you are just trying to deny any fault you have in the matter."
AmItheAsshole,3960uu,sandra_nz,-1,Tue Jun 9 15:50:38 2015 UTC,"True, I don't know anything about their relationship, but no one can deny that there is something not working between them. If either person in a relationship is willing to cheat, that's the end of that particular relationship. They have problems but they are not of my concern. Would it be better to make her feel guilty so she says something to her boyfriend? Probably, but she is an adult, she can make her own decisions."
AmItheAsshole,3960uu,_Gwink_,0,Tue Jun 9 18:24:42 2015 UTC,"your actions are clearly perpetuating the problems that they may have.   No matter what problems they have in their relationship, there is one huge problem that can't be overcome. She's a cheater.  In my opinion, it's one thing if you do something stupid in a weak moment and feel shame and regret about it. It's possible to forgive someone for what they did.  It's something completely different if you put all that effort into betraying your spouse and use every opportunity that you can. In my opinion, that's a huge personality flaw. You can't forgive someone for what they are.  OP is not causing any problems, he's just uncovering them. That doesn't make him the hero of this story, but claiming that he's (even partly) responsible for ruining a good relationship is wrong, in my opinion."
AmItheAsshole,3960uu,thisismeingradenine,2,Tue Jun 9 21:32:49 2015 UTC,There has to be something wrong in their relationship.   Then she should leave him. She just wants some side dick (assuming she's even sleeping with him at all anymore)

AmItheAsshole,3960uu,UberDave_141,3,Tue Jun 9 22:36:32 2015 UTC,"If we are talking about why you should care then I think you should care for a few reasons.   Reason number 1: The Current Relationship  She could have a bad relationship, and her fucking around with you COULD be an indication of that. However what is unknown is who this boyfriend is. Maybe this has happened before, and this boyfriend is the type to extort you, try to hurt you, in the name of keeping his girl. You say your playing a game, it's fair to assume in one scenario that the boyfriend, or his girlfriend are also BOTH of them are playing some kind of fucked up game too.  If you really think about it what you really want is to hook up with her, but at what cost? Do you really want to find out all the details? Do you really want to be involved with the shitstorm that could ensue once her boyfriend finds out? What if he beats he up and she comes running to you? Stay away from this dramatic bullshit for your own health and well being!  Reason two: This will shape who you are. Everything a person does adds to the sum of their existence. Once this is over will you be able to look at a girl you really love and have the confidence that you or her wont cheat? You like this game, what of the love of your life ends up playing with you? Can you really say you want that? You should care about this because no man can turn back th hands of time, and everything you are doing IS NOT UNDOABLE. Your life recording is one take, no cuts! Quit while your ahead and break this girl off and go find someone that you won't regret."
AmItheAsshole,3960uu,MindYerOwnBusiness,0,Tue Jun 9 16:34:34 2015 UTC,"My ignorance is a blessing, that's totally true. If I knew anything, it probably would have never gotten so far. It might end in a drama but a even higher probability is, that at some point, she is going to leave him and that's it. Is there a risk for me, yea, but so is driving my car every day.  I agree with you there partially. Everything a person does leads to that person's future self. That's a good saying but I'm not the one who is cheating here. If I love a girl wholeheartedly, I will never ever going to hurt her. Not the slightest of a chance. I will never cheat. I like the hiding game that's going on, but cheating on someone I love is never going to happen."

She's the one who's cheating, not you. You're not committed to anyone, including her boyfriend.  Still, she's doing something absolutely horrible to him and you're allowing her to use you for this. Personally, I wouldn't want to be a part of that mess but that's your decision.  If you want to do the right thing, try to somehow get a hold of him and tell him. This is incredibly important. Right now, he's on the wrong train, passing station after station without any clue. He will be pissed off when you tell him, but he has to know so he can get off and start looking for the right train. Please don't let him ride that train any longer. Please."

Almost anybody, if they found out their girlfriend is cheating on them, would be hurt and upset.  Chances are he will find out and you are part of causing another person to be hurt. It sounds like you are into the cheating as much as you are into her. That's pretty asshole-ish.   If you are into her, then tell her you'll hook up if she dumps him.

Secondly, you are both adults and she is the one making the initial choice, and something that i agree with you is not on your head but her's making it in the end her choice. however one scenario that keeps coming back to me is - and this is painting a picture and probably not at all true but something i would consider/think about if i was in the situation - What if the guy is not the problem? what if she is? what if he is trying his best keeping the relationship together and she in the one leeching of him for as long as she can? that is something you should care about, because you accept her behavior IE then you are enabling it thus being the ""real"" asshole"

She won't break up with him because you've created a new security for her. She has nasty habits that won't stop if you keep hooking up with her.

If anyone is the asshole, it is her, because she's the one being unfaithful.  You have made no promises to her boyfriend, and they aren't married, so It's fair game if she's interested.   Now, of course, in most unmarried romantic relationships, it would be hurtful and dishonest for either partner to have sex outside of the relationship (unless there is some kind of understanding that this is fair game).  But, one of the purposes for getting married is to make the promise of fidelity permanent, mutual, and binding (even in a legal sense).  It is at this point that everyone around the relationship should take responsibility for not trying to sexually interfere with it.    I think if you're crushing hard/in love with/pining for any woman with a boyfriend, you are within your rights to try get her attention and start a relationship until she refuses you.  If she's married, you lose that right."

If someone hit on your girlfriend prior to knowing she was in a relationship, there's nothing wrong with that. Now if he knew prior or continues to after, that IMO makes them a huge asshole.

Your father should not be seeing you as someone to make money from, I can't imagine taking payment from a child of mine in the same scenario. If anything I would be giving them money to help set up the new place. The whole 'dead to me' scenario is very childish, over dramatic as well. Even if he was hurt by not being asked he should have shrugged it off and taken the higher ground. A child-parent relationship is different to regular friends, nothing so slight as this should endanger it. It sounds like it was only a matter if time before something like this happened.

Your reasons make sense, but from his perspective you chose to trust a friend over him for no reason at all (because it wasn't explained to him). He probably feels humiliated as well considering he was telling people that he was going to be your agent.  That said he's a huge asshole for completely over reacting. I mean sure he should be mad, but cutting off you out of his life over money? I can't even wrap my mind around that."

AmItheAsshole,397c6w,DrProbably,1 point,Tue Jun 9 20:21:50 2015 UTC,"The only reason you might have been the asshole is if you invited most of the team to the party. In that case it would appear to outsiders that your criterion for getting an invite was ""everybody on the team gets to come, except this person I hate."" It also very directly excludes that person from the group, and it's not really your right to decide that she doesn't get to do activities attended by the group, even if you are the one hosting it. If you invite ""the team,"" you have to invite all of them.  By restricting invites to less than half of your teammates, however, you did not invite ""the team."" You just invited some of your closer friends, and they happened to be on the team. If your criterion for an invite is ""everybody who is at least this close of a friend gets an invite"" and she doesn't make it in that circle, that doesn't make you an asshole. She doesn't get to demand access to a party restricted to close friends just because she likes you, and since she didn't invite you to her thing, you don't have any obligation to repay any party-invite-related favors. I mean, you said it yourself: there were other people you declined to invite that you wanted there, because you wanted to keep it small. My verdict is: Not the asshole.

But none the less we are somewhat friends.    So, wait what? Does seeing people flirt weird you out or are you jealous? Are you interested in her or not? This part is a little confusing and your overall motives with this girl kinda sorta matter. If you actually like her and just didn't want her there, no you're not an asshole but you should probably do some damage control. If you don't care about her, then who bloody cares?"

AmItheAsshole,398qse,chmod_me,6,Wed Jun 10 01:53:38 2015 UTC,"100%, you were a total asshole. The issue comes in the fact that you didn't properly notify your team they weren't meeting expectations, and then suddenly (and very passive-aggressively) dropped it on them that you think they are all terrible employees. Remember, from their point of view, they have been doing their job correctly all this time. They turn in their work it gets accepted without a hitch: that's a successful day of work. When you accept a 20% error rate without ever letting them know that it is unacceptable, you implicitly set the minimum expectation for their job to be a 20% error rate. ""If I misspell one in five words, boss is happy; that's what it means to have basic competency. If I happen to only misspell one in 10 words, well hey, I overperformed today."" Actually, that's not quite correct, since they probably didn't even know that they were making so many mistakes, since you never told them. The one time you did told them, they said ""Really? I didn't notice mistakes"" and you said ""You know what, you are right, everything you are doing is great. Keep up the good work.""  When you suddenly tell them all the mistakes they are making, that doesn't send a message of ""hey team, I think we need to do a little better."" That sends a message of ""don't worry guys, it's okay that you are all so terrible at your job, because I've been fixing your fuck-ups for years. But, actually, if you could stop being such dumbasses, that would be great, thanks,"" in a super passive-aggressive tone like the boss from Office Space. I mean, you were the boss from Office Space here. You did exactly this, but like, way worse. You didn't bitch them out about forgetting the new cover sheet, you bitched them out about their entire worth as an employee. And, just to look at it from their point of view some more, why would their boss not try to help them learn to fix mistakes in their job for so long? The only possible reason is that the boss thinks they are so utterly incompetent that they are completely incapable of ever learning to do their job right. That's the only way those employees could interpret that email from you.  The correct way to handle this would have been to slowly increment your expectations for them back up to an acceptable standard. Only notify them of the biggest mistakes, and continue fixing the rest of it yourself. They already are working at 20% error rate, maybe for the next two weeks we can get it down to 18%. Then 16% over the next three. If it takes 6 months, well, you dug that hole, so you have to lie in it. If any of them couldn't keep up with the slowly-raising level of expectation, then they get a serious talking to about their need to improve. You re-train your employees to meet the proper standard of quality, and then you don't let them slip back to what they'd been doing. Honestly though, at this point, now that you've taught them that that shitty level of work is what is expected of them, the only way they can probably get better at their jobs is to get a new manager who will reset the minimum expectation.  In short, are you an asshole for wanting your team to be their best? No. Are you an asshole for passive-aggressively sending out a notice informing them that they are dumbasses and the only reason they haven't lost their job is because super-genius/saint you did it all for them? Absolutely."
AmItheAsshole,398qse,Cuddles_theBear,1 point,Wed Jun 10 04:14:03 2015 UTC,"I don't entirely disagree with you and maybe what you're saying is exactly right.  Their boss is an asshole who should have addressed the problem and continued to monitor it, not tell me that she didn't know what else to do about it.  I'm not their boss though, I'm just a minion that's been around for several years and has seen them do better work.  And seen them complain about past teammates who did to them what they are doing to me now.  I really feel like the problem on their end is as simple as choosing to glance over the account before they move on to the next one and see that all the boxes are checked, everything that's supposed to match does match, the name (as far as we've been told by the sales company that sent us the order) is not misspelled.  Why would you have to work back up to doing that incrementally, that is as simple as making the choice to do the job correctly instead of rushing through it."
AmItheAsshole,398qse,Cuddles_theBear,1 point,Wed Jun 10 21:19:01 2015 UTC,"Well, I don't know what your exact position is, but I don't think it matters. The way you handled it, it comes across like you think they are so stupid that there is no hope of them ever doing their job correctly. It doesn't matter if you are their boss or their coworker or hell, even their subordinate. It is their job to do that work, not yours, so if they are making a mistake you should point it out and have them fix it. Since you never did that, it comes across like you don't have faith in them to fix mistakes even after they have been directly pointed out. When you sent the message detailing all the mistakes over the last week, it might have read ""hey, can you guys fix these things in the future?"" but what it meant was ""I'm sick of doing your jobs for you, you fuck-ups."" Even if that's not how you meant it, that's the intent they will get from it.  As for why you work back up to doing the job correctly instead of telling them to fix it all at once, it's because telling them to fix it all at once results in exactly this type of drama. It's glaringly obvious that they would take it like a truly horrible passive-aggressive insult if you think about it from their point of view. Causing a huge drama shitfest is not going to help you get things working better, it's just going to piss everybody off and cause them to do worse work. If you tell somebody ""hey, your work is pretty good, but I think you made a little mistake here, can you fix it?"" it comes across as encouraging and they will gladly do it. Do that once a week for a few months, and eventually everything is sunshine and rainbows in the office. Just dumping a huge list of faults on somebody isn't encouraging, it makes you an asshole. Even ignoring how you come across, there's just no hope of fixing things if you say every problem all at once like that. People who think they are good will work to be a little bit better; people who think they are bad will give up."
AmItheAsshole,398qse,zjbird,3,Thu Jun 11 01:45:04 2015 UTC,"You're not an asshole, but it's absolutely completely ridiculous that you didn't just tell the supervisor. Instead you ended up joining in on the weird social drama. Still not an asshole, but in the future of your career, you need to understand that that is most of the point of having someone in a higher position. It's their job to sort out these sorts of issues. It's not your job to both try and communicate what other people are doing wrong and then join in on their pettiness when they don't listen.  Having said that, it's also a little bit of a catch 22 because it might be the main reason you got the new position so easily. Because you do your job without causing problems for the manager."
AmItheAsshole,398qse,zjbird,3,Wed Jun 10 01:59:25 2015 UTC,"I think you are probably right.  I'm not confident she would have done anything helpful, but at least I would have known sooner that I was no longer a good fit for this team."
AmItheAsshole,398qse,pharmasweaves,2,Wed Jun 10 02:04:27 2015 UTC,"You ended up getting drama with them anyway, but you might as well have let the drama come with them having a sit-down with the supervisor. If anything, they could tell the supervisor that their work load is simply too much for the two of them and they need to hire more people to help out, or maybe those people belong in another position, or maybe it would spiral into them quitting or being fired and replaced by more competent people.  By not saying anything other than making the same attempts to get them to do better, you're trying to do both your job, their job, and your supervisor's job, and although it worked out this time, that could lead to some serious power-struggle drama."

You went straight to accusing them for not showing up out of spite of you not going to their daughters' graduations. Even if their reason for not going to your daughter's graduation was simple ""eh, not my daughter's school"" then you should accept that they simply didn't want to go. Graduation ceremonies are boring as fuck. For you to not go to any other ceremonies (even if the game your daughter was in was the reason) you are an asshole for shaming everyone who didn't go to your daughter's.  Edit: What makes you even more of an asshole is not even giving them a chance to apologize or explain, and just assuming the worst. This is top-level mom-drama."
AmItheAsshole,396tg6,zjbird,3,Tue Jun 9 20:25:40 2015 UTC,"We have been planning on our girls graduation for years. We have always said we would be there for each one. This isn't s casual friendship. Our kids are friends, as well as our husbands. We've even taken numerous vacations together. We live in a small town. My daughters class was 45 students, and theirs is probably 80 at the most. This isn't like a friend didn't come, its more like a sister didn't come. And if the two high schools weren't such rivals, the spite angle wouldn't have even occurred to me."
AmItheAsshole,396tg6,zjbird,3,Tue Jun 9 20:58:15 2015 UTC,"Still, sounds like they tried reaching out to you about it and you ignored it, which is childish. If you have something to say to them, say it, but don't send a big angry text message and then ignore them."

So boring. You didn't go to their daughters' boring graduations, albeit with reason, so they surely felt less obligated to go to your daughter's boring graduation.   I feel like this is one of those personal dramas where if you ask other people for their opinions you're simply going to be told one thing from like-minded people and something else from people who don't have as much drama in their lives.   If you want this drama, continue doing what you're doing if it makes you feel better. If you want less drama, be the bigger person and let them know you're mad but get over it. I guess time heals all wounds, but I feel like people like this lose friends over petty bridge burning incidents that they can't just be the bigger person about.  P.S.

AmItheAsshole,396tg6,pharmasweaves,2,Tue Jun 9 20:39:36 2015 UTC,"This one might be ""everyone sucks"" but I'm leaning more towards you being the asshole. Lemme try to explain why.  Biggest issue first. Your friend has an abusive and controlling husband, and you're mad at her for it? What the hell OP. I can understand being frustrated with someone for not working to remove themselves from that environment but that shouldn't extend to being mad at her for being unable to follow up on her promise because her husband is a shitheel. This fact alone makes you an asshole but let's move on to see if you're the asshole.  You say that you and your friends always talked about going to the graduations of your kids but to me that doesn't mean ""I can't wait to be sitting in that stuffy auditorium on that exact date while a bunch of teenagers shuffle across a stage"". To me that more says ""Gee won't it be nice when all our kids are grown and going out into the world, aren't we the proud parents."" Like when someone says they'll dance on someones grave it just means they'll be happy when they're dead, not that they literally have plans to do a little softshoe on the plot. You being so focused on this seems like you misinterpreting a sentiment. I could be totally wrong on this point and maybe you and your friends have discussed your collective, genuine  graduation lust in great and exacting detail, but I doubt it.  Lastly I'm gonna address your assumptions. Why do you think that they did this to slight you? Is that the kind of friends you guys are? It seems like a big leap to assume not only that they knew how important it was to you but that they didn't attend as some specific protest to intentionally get under your skin. That thinking seems a bit paranoid and self centered.  All in all, you seem to have a pretty crappy concept of friendship if you think attending boring life events is a mandatory policy to being friends. They probably just didn't think their attendance was all that important to you. Obviously your friends should know you better than I do but from here it just seems like you're overreacting to a minor brush-off. If you truly let them know how upset you are and they didn't apologize then they're assholes too but you ignoring texts like a child holding their breath isn't gonna get anyone, anywhere."

AmItheAsshole,396tg6,pharmasweaves,1 point,Wed Jun 10 16:19:22 2015 UTC,"I'm not ready to forgive.   Sorry to say, you're the asshole, but not for feeling hurt, just for ignoring them and being unforgiving. Forgiving someone does not mean you forget what happened, and doesn't mean you don't have to feel bad about it. You can forgive someone and still feel hurt.  You jumped right into ""they must have done it out of spite"" rather than ""let's hear what the reasons are"". You had a legitimate excuse for missing graduations for the state championships, and maybe their excuses were legitimate too. The one who overslept probably felt terrible when they woke up and realized it, and the one who said their husband wouldn't let them come... well I don't know about that one though.  So you are fully within your rights to feel hurt, as I'm sure they felt hurt that you couldn't go to their ceremonies, but the fact that you jumped to conclusions, combined with further ignoring them and refusing to forgive them makes you the asshole.  TL;DR -  Feeling bad? Asshole = no  Ignoring them and being unforgiving? Asshole = yes  EDIT - Side note: I would be concerned about your friend if she is consistently using the excuse of her husband not allowing her to do things. If it is a constant lie, then maybe you should consider the level of friendship. If it is legitimate, maybe you should worry about a controlling husband."

Him for getting upset about a minor matter (although you already understood it probably wasn't that one thing but more an accumulation of stressful circumstances he's been under lately which mean he over-reacted).   You for escalating it by telling him to 'shut the fuck up'. You're old enough to know that's not how you de-escalate an angry situation.  He apologised, you didn't. Therefore, you are the asshole."

AmItheAsshole,394zzc,cytogirl,11,Tue Jun 9 16:39:43 2015 UTC,Yeah you are an asshole for not apologizing. It sounds like you can understand his behavior and although it's not an excuse it is a reason. He is still your father and you should still respect him. It would be one thing to have stopped his bad behavior and move on but you continued to pick a childish fight with him by calling names? It does sound like you should apologize as well. Especially as he owned up to his bad behavior and said sorry first. Time to grow up.
AmItheAsshole,394zzc,robobreasts,3,Tue Jun 9 13:22:23 2015 UTC,"I should note at this point my dad has been under a lot of stress with his business failing, and usually he is extremely well mannered and helps out a lot in the house, this case is the only time in my life I've seen him this crazy, and I attribute it to the stress.   So that doesn't excuse his behavior, but it does mitigate it somewhat.  It means he's not an asshole by nature, but engaged in an asshole behavior that is not even in character for him.  What's your excuse?  Because telling your father to ""shut the fuck up"" is absolutely asshole behavior.  Why do you think it is okay to talk to your father that way?  You sound like you're still living at home.  Do you understand that taking care of YOU is one of the things that contributes to his stress?  Worrying about taking care of his family if his business fails?  You sound like an extremely self-centered and ungrateful child.  He's upset at 'the way he gets treated'.  I'm obviously just guessing, but if your go-to move is to tell your dad to shut the fuck up, then weeks later not apologize, I'm guess he gets treated disrespectfully fairly often.  He apologized, and you didn't.  That makes you an asshole twice over.  As others have said, grow the fuck up.  See, I can say that to you because you're not my father and haven't worked hard to take care of me my whole life and I don't owe you anything.  You owe your dad respect and gratitude.  Hell, I had SHITTY parents and I didn't speak to them that way.  You acknowledge your dad is a hardworking good guy, but you treat him like that?  It's astounding that you think that is acceptable.  You're the child.  He's the parent.  It's his house.  You don't give him orders, it doesn't matter how tall you are.  Now I am not always on the parents side.  I read /r/raisedbynarcissists, and I have experience with shit parents.  In fact usually I am on the side of the children who get treated like shit by their parents.  So this isn't some knee-jerk reaction that all children must always be subservient or some shit like that.  You need to learn respect.  Your parents, your landlord, your boss at work, the judge you end up in front of... get some humility or you are going to have a shit life."

AmItheAsshole,394zzc,shawncoons,2,Tue Jun 9 12:30:13 2015 UTC,"I know it took a lot for him to come to you and ask to resolve differences.  That shows he cares about you and the relationship he has with you.  You responded to his initial out of proportion anger and rude language with your own anger and rude language, and for that you should also apologize.  But if nothing else, apologize because you are family and hopefully you care about the relationship as well.  Here's some advice from a total stranger that can serve you well: Offer apologies like they grow on trees.  It doesn't make you less of a man. It doesn't make you weak. It doesn't make you a pushover.  It shows that you are thinking and care about how other people feel.  Saying sorry is more often about taking care of feelings and relationships vs. admitting who is wrong and who is right."

AmItheAsshole,3938fg,fightms,39,Tue Jun 9 02:00:09 2015 UTC,"No, it was one of your conditions that she agreed to and not an unreasonable one. If she's fine with her dog having fleas and doing nothing about it that's bad enough, but she shouldn't be allowed to put your dog at risk when you're already doing her a huge favor by letting her crash. And if you did this out of pocket then you're all the more in the right"
AmItheAsshole,3938fg,almoore417,5,Mon Jun 8 23:02:48 2015 UTC,"it was one of your conditions that she agreed to   OP clearly said the 'condition' was that she give the dog a bath, not cut his hair. As far as we know, OP never even mentioned cutting it's hair to the sister, so I can understand why the sister would be mad to come home to find out her sister/brother decided that her dog was now their dog and they could do whatever they wanted with it. I'd be mad too.  OP should have told her that if she didn't do something about the fleas in -however much time- that she could find somewhere else to stay, but it was definitely not their place to take it upon their self to cut the dog's hair."
AmItheAsshole,3938fg,charliebeanz,12,Mon Jun 8 23:15:54 2015 UTC,"You are right about the cutting. I'm not sure about if it was necessary to get rid of the fleas but if it was, then since the main reason was to protect his own dog, the cutting was as important as the bath. And you're also right. Maybe OP should have set a deadline of some sort for the wash"
AmItheAsshole,3938fg,almoore417,2,Mon Jun 8 23:47:07 2015 UTC,"If I were the owner the deadline would be any time before the dog entered my home.   Fleas are frigging relentless, multiply rapidly, and do attack people.  You only need 1 flea to drop off her dog and lay eggs for an infestation to begin."
AmItheAsshole,3938fg,flignir,2,Tue Jun 9 14:22:43 2015 UTC,"My second condition was that she get rid of the dog's fleas. I'm not sure if you've seen how long a shih-tzu's hair can grow, but it's nearly impossible to comb fleas out at full-length.  Check out dog rescue videos where people take dogs off the streets and nurse them to health. Long-haired dogs are almost always shaved in order to care for their skin and rid the fleas more easily."
AmItheAsshole,3938fg,charliebeanz,-5,Tue Jun 9 15:53:31 2015 UTC,"Except you're not running a dog rescue.   My grandma tells me that the best treatment for head lice is kerosene (which I hear burns like a bitch) and shaving the head completely. If I was in a situation where I was staying with her and my 6-year-old daughter got head lice, and my grandma decided to take matters into her own hands, I would be livid. Extreme example, but you get what I'm saying.  It doesn't matter what dog rescues do for sick dogs that have no owners and are voluntarily brought to them for that specific treatment. This dog has an owner and you can't just do whatever you want with another person's dog without their permission, regardless of your 'conditions' or their current living situation. Just like landlords aren't allowed to shave their tenant's pets, neither are you.  How would you feel if you came home and your dog looked like this?"
AmItheAsshole,3938fg,charliebeanz,5,Tue Jun 9 22:22:03 2015 UTC,"He was infested with fleas. His skin was absolutely covered in sores, some of which were bleeding. He was scratching constantly and whining in pain. I couldn't treat his skin without cutting the fur. This isn't about a haircut, it was about a neglected dog and a owner who didn't care to do anything about it. Perhaps I'm an asshole for what I did, but I frankly don't care, because the dog's health and physical comfort improved significantly because of it."
AmItheAsshole,3938fg,charliebeanz,-7,Tue Jun 9 22:30:56 2015 UTC,"Again, just because you think that's the best way to handle things, does not give you the right to mess with other people's property. Dogs are considered property. The very least you could have done was talk to her about it and tell her that you think she should cut the dogs hair, and the most you should have done was tell her that if she didn't get the fleas under control, she would have to find somewhere else to stay. There is absolutely no reason why you should have felt you have the right to shave the hair off of somebody else's pet. That's not your decision to make. And I know the lines become a little blurred when you're family and I know she's your sister, but that still doesn't mean that what's hers is yours.   Perhaps I'm an asshole for what I did, but I frankly don't care   Then why would you make a post in a sub titled /r/AmITheAsshole asking if you were in the wrong? And then get defensive when someone tells you that you were in the wrong? Seems pointless to me."

Her for not doing what you asked and for letting her poor dog suffer with a bad flea problem for so long.  You, not for washing the dog, but for cutting it's hair.    If I had to choose the lesser of two assholes, it is you.  Plus, the fur will grow back."
AmItheAsshole,3938fg,zombies8mybrain,8,Mon Jun 8 23:23:50 2015 UTC,"Best thought out answer on here. She is obviously a total asshole for both neglecting the animal and breaking her promises. But 2 assholes don't make a right, and I strong disagree with the cutting of the fur without her knowing. Something like washing is fine, but cutting can take time to grow back. Think of it like a kid, would you get your sisters kid a hair cut because he was a sloppy mess? I would hope not because for some people thats a pretty serious offense.  The thing you could have done better: Tell her. Could have just said in passing ""If your dog isn't cleaned up by tomorrow when I get home I'm going to bathe him and shave him bald so he doesn't have fleas."" and then if she doesn't do it then you kinda are in the right to do it. Or even right when you were gonna do it just call her and say ""I'm gonna shave your dog unless you clean this shit up right now"". Anything to let her know.  I'm watching my sisters dog and cat for the week myself, I don't have animals to catch fleas but my family still hates them as they bite some of their feets. I got mad about the fleas but my reaction was to bathe the dog and tell her I'm getting some flea medication. I told her for two reasons: I expect to be reimbursed and because she might have already given him flea meds and it could be too much for him so I had to make sure he hadn't had any recently. Then I left them at my house while I went to her house to disinfect her carpet, then the next day I left her animals at her house while I cleaned my carpets. No more fleas.  I know hair might not seem like a big deal to a lot of people, but to some people it's a semi permanent thing. I wouldn't mess with it."

Dogs cannot advocate for themselves, therefore it is up to humans to care for them when they are neglected or the victims of cruelty.  I would say your sister made two vital errors:  1)  She agreed to your terms, but then failed to honour them.  2)  She grossly neglected the wellbeing of her pooch.  This is unforgivable, and she's lucky you didn't report her to your local animal welfare agency.  People take a dim view of such things."
AmItheAsshole,3938fg,bluepepper,5,Tue Jun 9 00:32:18 2015 UTC,"I don't know why you would even let that dog in the house in the first place, and tell her that dog hair grows back and to deal with it. You need to be more of an asshole about this to her to be honest."
AmItheAsshole,3938fg,Nasicus,2,Tue Jun 9 01:19:21 2015 UTC,People seemed to getting pissed about cutting the dogs hair. But maybe he cut its hair to make it easier to get rid of the fleas. I'm assuming short hair would be a lot easier to see the fleas and also short hair would give them less to cling to. She should have respected your wishes and gotten her dog cleaned up. So she has no real place to complain.
AmItheAsshole,3938fg,Beaverfever94,2,Tue Jun 9 05:40:34 2015 UTC,"People seemed to getting pissed about cutting the dogs hair. But maybe he cut its hair to ...   Does it matter what his goal is?  No matter how good the intentions, ultimately it's the kind of decision that the owner takes (unless you want to argue that the owner is grossly negligent).   She should have respected your wishes and gotten her dog cleaned up. So she has no real place to complain.   She is in the wrong and is in a bad position to complain.  But the measures he took were quite drastic and apparently never discussed nor agreed, so he's in the wrong too.  I think the appropriate action would've been to give her an ultimatum first."
AmItheAsshole,3938fg,helenmemel1,2,Tue Jun 9 12:16:46 2015 UTC,unless you want to argue that the owner is grossly negligent   I would argue the owner is grossly negligent. Letting the dog have so many fleas that there are tons of bite marks all over its body and not doing anything about it is pretty negligent. And the excuse that you don't have the time is not acceptable. No one works that much and is it really that hard to set aside a couple hours on one day to take care of a living thing.   I think the appropriate action would've been to give her an ultimatum first.   He basically did. He told her part of rules of living there was to keep her dog flea free. Dealing with fleas sucks and they will get everywhere. She didn't listen and kept making excuses so he had to do it himself. His other option was to kick her out. Would that have been a better option? Long haired dogs are a lot of work and if she is too busy to take care of the dog then she shouldn't have one. Honestly its just hair and it will grow back. She should get over it and be thankful she has a brother who is willing to help her in a time of need.
AmItheAsshole,3938fg,mittensquish,1 point,Tue Jun 9 13:55:51 2015 UTC,"By ultimatum I mean spelling out the consequences.  Saying ""you can stay if you wash your dog"" is an arrangement, not an ultimatum.  Saying ""you broke the arrangement.  You have one more day or I will shave the dog"" is an ultimatum.  He'd be in the clear shaving it after that."

The only reason you are in this mess is because he assumed you still wanted it when you really didn't. He's going to feel hurt because from his point of view, he went out of his way to get you something you wanted with his own money and now you are throwing it away. But that's not what happened at all.  When you assume somebody isn't telling the truth, anything that comes out of that is on you. He made a conscious decision to assume you weren't being honest about not wanting the costume, and so he bought it anyways. If it turns out that you actually don't want it, then it is his fault for not listening to you. Of course, he's not an asshole for trying to do something nice, but you're not an asshole just because he went off and did something against your wishes that you aren't happy with.  I would suggest just letting him choose what to do with the pieces that you have. Tell him that you probably aren't going to use it, but because he's the one who bought it, you won't sell it if he doesn't want that. It seems like the fairest way to deal with this situation."

Sometimes it is hard to dump a girl, sometimes it seems much easier to stay with her so you will forgive her or give her the benefit of the doubt.  Just get rid of her and be done with it. She sounds like a parasite."
AmItheAsshole,392cnb,NatanGold,1 point,Tue Jun 9 13:05:53 2015 UTC,No she's not a parasite.. She was very sweet and loving.. We always had fun whenever we were together.. I knew that she really loved me. But somewhere along the line.. Something snapped.. I cant figure out what and why.. Sometimes I feel terrible for letting her go. Sometimes I feel it was the right thing to do and that its best she's not with me anymore.. But I haven't felt that spark which I had with her with anyone else. FYI this whole break up scene is over an year old.
AmItheAsshole,392cnb,MaddPony,2,Tue Jun 9 13:26:03 2015 UTC,"It gets better, I can promise you that.  The worst thing about breaking up a long distance relationship is that you are so used to thinking about her when she isnt around you dont see the big change in your life the way a breakup does."
AmItheAsshole,3918r7,Tamagogo,6,Mon Jun 8 14:46:25 2015 UTC,"I don't think you're an asshole, but you might want to talk to a professional.  What you described is symptomatic of a few psych disorders, and seeing a therapist could keep this from repeating."
AmItheAsshole,3918r7,Funkingthefake,1 point,Mon Jun 8 15:22:37 2015 UTC,"While not particularly averse to the idea can I ask as to why you think so?  Personally the way I look at it was just a bad roll of the dice in terms of stress from work, personal pressure, outside factors. I consider myself to generally be a introvert though the vast majority of people get the exact opposite impression. However within my job, hobbies, and daily life I am surrounded with and deal with groups of people. I can enjoy it but it definitely is draining for me. I generally balance it all out with personal time but I believe that particular instance was just a bad combination of overworking and lack of personal time and in the process something I've learned from."
AmItheAsshole,3918r7,Funkingthefake,4,Mon Jun 8 21:04:54 2015 UTC,"First off, spending three days curled up in bed with the blinds drawn as a reaction to social stress is not a typical or a healthy way of dealing.  They say everyone has issues, and it's not until they start interfering with your life, and I think checking out from the universe for half a week qualifies.  Stress management isn't just about anger, you know.  There's crippling anxiety too.  You probably wanted to tell your friends what was up, but couldn't.  Believe me, I've stared at the phone while an important call went unanswered and went to voicemail plenty.    Seeing a professional could help you deal with this stress and anxiety.  I know you only lost one example, but if you're honest with yourself, you can probably come up with some less severe examples of this stress/withdrawl mechanism.  If left unchecked, this won't go away, and the introversion/social anxiety can lead to bad depression.  Source: Life"

AmItheAsshole,3918r7,Funkingthefake,3,Tue Jun 9 02:23:11 2015 UTC,"I'm not a doctor, and it's not possible to say for certain from this one example, but it could be something like generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder, depression is a possibility, and if this is a repeating pattern, then cyclothemia or something on the bipolar spectrum are a possibility.  Then again, it could be just basic stress management or learning to balance being an extroverted introvert."

AmItheAsshole,390lti,cobblershine,7,Mon Jun 8 11:14:02 2015 UTC,"Hmm, well this might sound kinda shitty to ask, but does this happen often, or is it a one off? Because it seems like she feels led on, and while it doesn't sound like you've done it maliciously or even with knowing, if this is something that's happened several times, you might be a bit of a dick.  But let's assume this is a one off. I don't think that you're an asshole, I think that it's just unfortunate. She has feelings for you, you kissed/dated and she felt something that you simply didn't. So now she feels used or led on and likely a bit humiliated, and perhaps blames you for that. But what are you meant to do? The whole point of dating is to find out whether or not people are compatible, so you're not an asshole for deciding after dating for a bit that it wasn't going to work.  The kiss was a bad idea, and imo the closest thing in this that comes close to being an asshole, but again it depends on other things. Did you know that she had feelings for you at the time? If so, then yeah that's a pretty harsh thing to do and while I wouldn't say you're an asshole for not wanting to date her, you're an asshole for kissing her when you knew you didn't feel the same as her. But did you think that it was just a bit of fun? If you did, then I'd say it was just a bit of a dingus mistake on your behalf, but not malicious.  I wouldn't say she's an asshole either though, just maybe a little hurt and angry. I wouldn't get too angry over it and try to see it from her perspective. While it might not seem rational, people aren't very rational, especially when upset. I think that it would be good to be understanding and maybe give her some space to vent. Don't take it too personally.  For the love of God though don't kiss her or anything again"
AmItheAsshole,390lti,Ultra-ChronicMonstah,3,Mon Jun 8 11:52:38 2015 UTC,"No, this doesn't happen to me (thank God).  I understand she is probably upset, and I know rejection sucks.  I just want to make sure I'm not a dick for how things went down.  I hate making people feel bad :("
AmItheAsshole,390lti,Ultra-ChronicMonstah,3,Mon Jun 8 12:30:59 2015 UTC,"Well based on this, I think it's pretty fair to say that you're not an asshole. It really just seems like a shitty situation where nobody wins. But in the end, it would have been far crueler to date her despite not wanting to, and it would have ended far, far worse. It might make you feel like a harsh guy but by drawing the line in the sand you've saved a lot of heartache later on. Hopefully one day she'll look back and feel that you made the better decision"
AmItheAsshole,390lti,Tamagogo,3,Mon Jun 8 13:56:31 2015 UTC,Grow up and get this person out of your life if they cannot come to the understanding that you are not interested in a relationship with them. Or deal with the drama that will ensue. Whatever.

As for the computer, I think there is some shared assholery.  You allowed yourself to get roped into doing something that you clearly resent, and then acted pissy - classic passive-aggressive martyr behavior. But they are being hostile by refusing to step out of their comfort zone and learn something new.  You really can just say ""no, it's too frustrating for me, given your lack of skills, to try to teach you extremely basic computer functions, and doing so makes me feel angry.

AmItheAsshole,391io1,Nate-Rod,1 point,Mon Jun 8 23:43:07 2015 UTC,"Considering both examples and you not telling people what you think: No, you are not the asshole.  However (and this is a hefty however): Once you begin telling these people what you think, whether you're the asshole or not is dependent on the situation at hand, and more importantly, your tone.  In the first example with Julie you could argue that she chose this outcome by her refusal to leave the relationship even though she kept coming to you for relief and comfort. You wouldn't be the asshole if you told her that she didn't leave the relationship and that she could still choose to end it.  In the second example, you'd be the asshole.   I just have the 'roll my eye' moment and commenting like ""you most probably did something to deserve this or didn't do enough and deserve this"" but I never do post the comment.   First off, you don't know the person, nor do you know the tendencies of the other person. They could be a manipulative bastard who cheated for the sake of cheating, or you could be right. Jumping to conclusions on a situation that you don't know the details of makes you an asshole.  tl;dr - Keep it to yourself and you'll be fine. If you have to say it, watch your tone when you do."

AmItheAsshole,391io1,MereGirl,2,Tue Jun 9 04:52:48 2015 UTC,"We would need an actual example. I do want to say that keeping your opinions to yourself would probably be the best route to go. You can think you would act one way in a situation, but you end up acting the total opposite when you're actually in the situation. It's easy to say ""I would never do that. I will never be this."" when you're on the outside looking in."
AmItheAsshole,391io1,MereGirl,1 point,Mon Jun 8 19:18:15 2015 UTC,"Ok. Maybe I can use one of my friend as an example;  There's this girl, slightly older than me, let's call her Julie. I know I like Julie and she's a great person who's independant and self sufficient. She just gives off that motherly feel and can be very very aggressive when the situation calls for it.  She fell in love with this guy, let's call him Leo. Leo has a lot of baggage. He has had his engagement broken off, multiple flings, very bad past relationships. Don't get me wrong, he's a friend of mine and he's not that bad towards me but I have yet to see his true colours. He also has quite an eye for details.  So for the duration of their relationship, Julie would often just breakdown in front of me and just go on and on about how Leo is being irrational, possessive, not attentive etc etc and as a good friend, I'd try to comfort her. This happened like maybe 6-8 times? Before I got sick and tired of it. On the 7/8th time she went to me, I just told her ""If he makes you upset this much, then why do you continue your relationship with him?"" And she couldn't give me a definite answer.  So from the 3rd time she came crying to me, I already had the 'you chose this' in my head but I never actually did say it out. It just made me roll my eyes everytime this happens.  And for the 'I've never met' kind of person; I just see a facebook post of a girl and she was ranting on facebook on how her boyfriend cheated on her and how an ungrateful son of a ***** he is. Posting pictures of the text message between the guy and another girl as proof of his disloyalty.  All I see in the comments are ""be strong"", ""omg, you dont deserve this"", ""I'm sorry to hear that"" and I just have the 'roll my eye' moment and commenting like ""you most probably did something to deserve this or didn't  do enough and deserve this"" but I never do post the comment.

I saw it happen with so many of my friends and I felt the same way you did until it happened to me and I got it. It could also be that she's scared / doesn't want to be alone, afraid of failure, or determined to be validated in some way. There are a ton of reasons people choose to stay in bad situations, they may not really know what it is themselves or are in denial or there are just so many. It's fine if you think the way you think, but there is usually more to the story that isn't that simple. Just be glad you haven't ever felt that way!   I don't mean just in relationships either, there are a lot of miserable situations in life people stay in for different reasons.

Part of becoming an adult is realising that your dad is just another human being, making his way through the world the best way he knows how. He's not perfect, but then, neither are you. He's not everything a father should me, but then you're not everything a son should be, are you?  I'm sure that once you start living on your own, rather than under the same roof, you will get along a hell of a lot better. Distance is great for relationships!  Instead of focusing on how your dad doesn't understand you or give you the support you want, maybe you could focus more on understanding your dad. Ask him about his life, about what his childhood/teenage years were like, ask him about what mistakes he's made and what good decisions he's made. Don't make this about your relationship with him, make it an exercise in getting to know him better. You might gain some valuable insights into why he relates to you in the way he does."

His father was an outdoors-men while he was a computer guy. They never really spent time together or talked because they had nothing in common. When he went away to college, he started getting into hockey. When his father found out, his father bought a book on hockey and began researching the local hockey team. When he came home from college, they started watching games together. Over time that one shared activity allowed them to build a close relationship.         I don't think you are an asshole. I think that you're upset that your relationship with your father isn't what you want it to be and you've given up hope. Maybe your father doesn't know how to connect with you. Maybe you can help bridge the gap. Keep an open mind. You never know what opportunities the future may bring or what opportunities you can create."

It's very possible he just might not really know how to interact with you.  (You're a teenager. Teenagers are scary to parents. Hormonal, figuring themselves out, dealing with brand new responsibilities and stressors while still being a ""kid"". This isn't a criticism; it's a fact of life.)  Also, remember that your father is a person who existed before you did. He has his own anxieties, insecurities, and shit he has to deal with. I know you don't get along with him. Join the club. My dad and I don't get along either--and, in fact, he can be a huge asshole, and often--but I'm willing to deal with it because I know he cares about me and does a lot for me.

He was going to buy you a car so I'm assuming yes to the above.   Yep you're being the asshole, take it from someone who's father was barely around growing up, who half the time didn't know if his father was alive or dead, and still tried to have somewhat of a relationship with his father. You are being the asshole, try to have somewhat of a relationship.   I'll leave you with this exchange between Dr. Cox and J.D. on Scrubs to drive my point home.   Dr. Cox: You are, in fact, a perfectly healthy 26-year-old doctor who keeps whining about how horrible his father was.   J.D.: Well, he did some considerable emotional damage, so...   Dr. Cox: Every one of our parents does considerable emotional damage, and from what I've heard, it just might be the best part of being a parent. Now, if some guy ever does put a ring on your finger and you're lucky enough to pop out a youngster, I'm sure you'll understand. But for now, believe me when I tell you I wouldn't care if this was the first time you ever met your daddy. Because, in reality... well, he could have done a much, much worse job."

He's the asshole because he's the adult and should have been responsible for the past. They ought to cancel each other out. This man created you. Don't wait until it's too late to reconcile and bury the pain of not having him there for you.  Despite the fights, you both love each other and that should prevail overall."

Your father probably doesn't know what to do and so he hasn't really done anything for you other than giving you the basic necessities. My father was the same. I was an accidental bastard, one that ended up with my father getting tied down to my mother (due to his catholic family) and he never really seemed to know what to do with me. We had a similar experience to what you and your father had when my father ended up in a really bad car wreck and we both ended up crying into each others shoulders promising we would be better towards each other. When he got home, though, neither of us knew what to do. Then, about two months later, my father died from a heart attack. Ever since I have regretted not simply sitting down and talking to him, no matter how awkward it would have been, so that we could have had a better relationship in the end.  I guess the rambling morale of this story is to put aside any perceived slights, sit down with him at the dinner table and TALK. If that doesn't work... well, at least you tried."
AmItheAsshole,38y689,titanicmango,1 point,Mon Jun 8 06:53:09 2015 UTC,"I think your being an asshole, also you seem to be leaving out crucial information. What do you argue about with him? inb4 everything, no one ever argues about everything. I bet you have never argued about whether pluto is a planet or a dwarf planet.   Here's why: Why would you get into an argument at all, let alone a screaming argument, with the person who is just about to fork out four figures worth of money to buy you something. That, truly, by itself, makes you an asshole.  Something to think about: There is a point in time, and it often happens a lot if you are being aware of it, when it's best to just accept defeat, even if you know 100% that they are wrong, and I believe that argument in particular was one of them.  However, with me bashing you like this. Don't take it to heart and dwell, take it constructively. As most people have said, you are only young, you will say things you shouldn't and not realise what you have done. Next time you're in an argument with him, just agree with him. It ends the argument immediately and you can move on with other things.  On a side note, as you are 17, just remember that he has no obligation, and hasn't since you turned 16, to do anything for you, not even house you, he could have kicked you out. All the things he is has done for you, currently doing for you, and the things that he will do for you, he is doing it because he cares and loves you."

If you think he's going to use the car as a tool to guilt you into staying in contact with him, do not let him buy it for you.

You do not owe him anything, least of all sex.      If someone makes a teenage girl feel like an asshole because she doesn't want to have sex, that is a problem.  I am going to give him the benefit of the doubt that he is too young to realize what an asshole he is being.  You need to confront him about this problem and let him know you won't be pressured into having sex whenever it suits him.     I know it's easy to shirk off the opinion of adults, but I am a former teenage girl, so I hope you will listen when I tell you to be careful with this boy.  This story (given, that is all we know about your relationship) makes it sound an awful lot like he likes you mostly for the sex.  I experienced a similar situation when I was younger and it ended in a lot of heartache for me.   Be careful.  Talk to the adults in your life about the choices you are making.

Sometimes my husband gets very emotional about being rejected when he wants sex. For him at least sex is a way to connect in a way that hanging out just doesn't full fill. Sometimes when he's stressed the rejection hurts him a lot. Keep in mind, it may be more to him then just screwing around.        Now I'm not saying that should or should not have sex with him. I'm just trying to add a little perspective. Talk to him about why he is so upset about it. You may find there's more to it then just sex. It might be a good idea to plan a ""fun"" day with him, that way he has something to look forward to if he's feeling down."

One day. If you are close enough to the venue that you could drive there, then absolutely you are the asshole. The fact that they are willing to fight with you about it clearly means that they actually want you there, and the only reason you have to not attend is out of spite.  If you have to fly to get to the wedding, then it's much less clear and depends on how long the flight takes and how much money you have. If you would have to fly, for example, from the States to India, then you're all clear. A huge time/money commitment like that shouldn't be expected if you two don't get along. If you have to fly a shorter distance, like San Francisco to Seattle (2 hour flight), and you have the money for it, then you would be the asshole."

As well as my outlook on the groom. I also figured since my parents are paying. It would be wasteful for them to also have to pay for me ...since I dont even want to attend.   This is the only thing that I find a bit assholish here. Consider that it's not your call whether or not it's wasteful to spend the money; they've clearly decided it's not a waste, if they've invited you. It's insulting to make that call for them.  As far as it being a farce, consider that if you've been invited, your sister either wants to keep up appearances or make amends. Either way, I don't see what's to be gained by slighting her, since doing so can cause major rifts in the family over.. what, exactly?  Also, nobody wants to attend these things. I didn't want to attend my own damn wedding. That's the most irrelevant thing here."

You're not an asshole for not attending the wedding of someone you don't like. Still, it is a bit cruel to hold a grudge when the offender is trying to apologize if that is what is going on."

If they don't want to be there then we don't really want them there.  If you don't approve of who she's getting with then definitely don't be there.  The only people who should be at the wedding are people that support the marriage.  In my opinion anyway.  I feel like it's bad luck to have people there that deep inside don't want or support the marriage.  I mean in most weddings they do ask if anyone objects so it's better to not fill the room with people who object and let that question be answered.

Attend the wedding out of respect for your mutual blood, but skip the reception.   Also I'd like to know, do you just not get along because you're different people or did your sister do something horrible like kill your pet or purposely publicly humiliate you repeatedly? If she was like an abuser or something of the sort that would excuse you but if it's just a case of sibling rivalry or petty disagreements, you should put that aside and you'd be the asshole."

Along the same line, and I agree with Cuddles in regard to the financial aspects, what's the worst that could happen by attending? At the very least you show the rest of the family that you are capable of being more mature and making an effort to reconcile.

If my husband ever behaved this way in public, I would be the first one to call him down and demand he behave like a decent, rational, adult human being. I get that he's a father and, in his mind, he's defending his child, but he's wrong, and guess what, millions of people are parents, and it's not a rationale for acting like an asshole.

Husband and wife do not have to agree on everything all the time, as long as communication is kept open and compromises are made by both parties.  IMO, I think your husband walked out of there and felt a bit like an asshole.  In situations like that (a near-miss of your baby falling), it's understandable to have an emotional response.  However, your husband took it too far with the verbal abuse and especially with the spitting.  I think he somewhat realized that as you were in the car, and he was looking for you to give him ""permission"" to have acted that way."

He wanted to know that I supported his actions, but of course he could tell from my attitude that I didn't approve. We've been together long enough for me to know that if I didn't agree wholeheartedly and present a United front with him on this, that his anger would swivel to me. He wants me to always be in his corner, as it were, and usually I do side with him, but I can't this time."

AmItheAsshole,38udye,MaddPony,-1,Tue Jun 9 15:12:10 2015 UTC,"You arent an asshole, and neither is your husband. Some people have been rather rude in the comments, especially towards your husband. Your husband is simply a man, and it sounds like he has high levels of testosterone. Thats a good thing. He was acting out against percieved injustice. He was protecting his family, and his pride. What sort of man would he be if he didnt? You wouldnt want a pussy for a husband. So you should show him support and respect even when you dont understand or agree with his Decisions. However, it does sound like he overreacted and was rude to you. You can talk to him about it later when you are both calm. Just whatever you do, dont hurt his ego."

Filling your page with only people you already see all the time seems a little redundant.

It happens naturally as you get older; people move away and have life commitments, (jobs, kids, round-the-world cruises) and your contact will be less frequent.  You can have a connection with someone without regular contact, and when you do meet up at a wedding/birthday/whatever you can have the ""so, how is your life going?"" conversation.

AmItheAsshole,38oyls,bizarrega,6,Fri Jun 5 18:24:40 2015 UTC,Good point.  What is the whole agreement?
AmItheAsshole,38oyls,flignir,4,Fri Jun 5 22:11:56 2015 UTC,"Mother agreed to pay for all bus travel for me to go to college (high school if you're in the US).  Mother got annoyed for me for something for which removal of bus money would be an over-reaction (I don't remember exactly what). Was not phrased as ""will no longer pay for your transport"" but ""I am  going to fucking test you"" (actual words used).  The total sum is only partially from the total removal of funds, and partially includes money that is owed from when I paid for the ticket due to not being given money when not being ""tested"".  In all honesty, I don't think I'd ask for all the money back, but I'd like the ""testing"" money back."
AmItheAsshole,38oyls,flignir,3,Fri Jun 5 23:04:22 2015 UTC,So you were not required to do anything in order to earn the payment for the bus?
AmItheAsshole,38oyls,flignir,3,Fri Jun 5 23:06:29 2015 UTC,"You are correct, I was not required to do anything.  I appreciated the money, I truly did, but nothing was required of me."
AmItheAsshole,38oyls,flignir,3,Fri Jun 5 23:12:49 2015 UTC,"Then there was no agreement. You're using the wrong word. Basically, you were accustomed to your parents paying for the bus, and at any point, it is their prerogative to stop paying for the bus.  They don't owe you anything. Regardless of what mood your mother was in when she made the decision(s), you're the asshole if you go looking to get money back."
AmItheAsshole,38oyls,Syene,-1,Fri Jun 5 23:16:06 2015 UTC,"I don't understand how there was no agreement.  While it may have been that I was required to do nothing, it had frequently been described as an agreement, and whenever I wanted to discuss the matter, it was always that they ""agreed to pay my bus fare""."
AmItheAsshole,38oyls,bilscuits,5,Fri Jun 5 23:38:27 2015 UTC,"When you say that any two parties have an agreement, whether or not it written or legally binding, you are implying a formal structure in which one party gives something of value to another party, and the second party gives something of value to the first.  In either case, if one person fails to do their part, they have breached the agreement, and the other one is either entitled to restitution for the costs incurred by doing his part, or he is freed of any burden to do his part.  The point to an agreement is that both sides are clear on what is expected of them, and the penalty for failure.  If only one party is giving anything, and only one party is benefitting, than there are no terms to enforce, and no significance to the agreement.   Yes, your mom ""agreed"" to pay, and in fact she did pay for over a year, as you have said elsewhere.  So she lived up to her word; she just didn't perpetually keep doing what you grew accustomed to.  Since you didn't put anything in and have no damages to claim...there's no agreement."
AmItheAsshole,38oyls,NatanGold,6,Sat Jun 6 00:00:03 2015 UTC,"You raise some interesting points. I guess it was my understanding that the ""agreement"" we had was one of generalised reciprocity; this was a favour being done on my part, and I was to make up for it in the future or over time with a product of equal but different value.  Whatever the case or outcome, I must say that I appreciate your attitude and that you have been able to be civil where others have not, whether through a character flaw or misinformation."
AmItheAsshole,38oyls,yydnic,13,Sat Jun 6 00:30:50 2015 UTC,"...back from my family?   I missed the part where you loaned them money.  It sounds like they've simply stopped funding a part of your life, and that's just part of growing up."
AmItheAsshole,38oyls,Bookworm12k,10,Fri Jun 5 20:49:30 2015 UTC,"Sounds like you're the asshole to me, but you given us such little detail that it's really hard to say.  I think the bottom line is that your parents offered to pay for something for you, then they decided later that they no longer wanted to do that. That's their prerogative.  Even if your parents were in the wrong by withholding the money, once the argument is settled going back and demanding the money you had to pay during the time they decided to stop giving you free money that you did not work for is an asshole move. Let the issue go and move on."
AmItheAsshole,38oyls,flignir,6,Fri Jun 5 19:07:29 2015 UTC,"To be clear, are you asking your parents to pay for six months of bus trips that you took and they said they would not pay for? Like, you got in a fight back in November or December, and your mom said ""No more free rides"", and now you expect her to pay you back for the bus trips you made from Nov/Dec to present?  If the answer to this is yes, then yeah, you're the asshole, by a long shot. An entitled, immature asshole. TANSTAAFL, bro."
AmItheAsshole,38oyls,AmateurHero,-1,Fri Jun 5 19:29:24 2015 UTC,"I guess I didn't include enough details and have been a little unclear.  Not all of the money came from the phase where money was denied to me, sometimes it was just circumstance that wasn't re-paid or my parents didn't physically have the money on them. This money was usually repaid to me.  However, there was a period of ~2 months where no money at all was paid to me out of spite. It was never ""no more free rides"", it was expressly told to me that it was to test me.  I think everybody else is reading this in a way that my mother was acting unlike a crazy person. She's prone to temper tantrums, there's no other way to put it."
AmItheAsshole,38oyls,flignir,11,Fri Jun 5 20:06:48 2015 UTC,Yes. Why do you feel entitled to money that you didn't earn?
AmItheAsshole,38oyls,mmm_leftboob,-6,Fri Jun 5 18:09:28 2015 UTC,"I don't know if something was unclear. The arrangement was longstanding for over a year, and my mother then took back this arrangement, forcing me to pay for a considerable length of time.  I'm not after additional money, only the money that I would otherwise have in my bank account.  This is money I did earn, but I feel I have been unfairly forced to use it."
AmItheAsshole,38oyls,DrProbably,6,Fri Jun 5 18:58:40 2015 UTC,"Was it a legally binding contact? If not, you're acting a bit like an entitled twat."
AmItheAsshole,38oyls,ArtGoftheHunt,3,Fri Jun 5 19:27:22 2015 UTC,"Not sure if whether or not it's a binding contract is the right standard to apply here.  /u/ProjectFrostbite didn't ask if his mom could be prosecuted.  He asked if he's the asshole for expecting her to keep her word.    I think a more relevant question is ""what did the agreement require of you?""  For instance, if OP agreed to mow the lawn all summer before college in exchange for his parents agreeing to pay for transport payments, I think I'd be more likely to say the parents are the assholes, because it's not like Frostbite can take back his already complete lawn-mowing when they backed out.  That really feels like something that should be rectified with repayment, if it were the case."
AmItheAsshole,38oyls,ArtGoftheHunt,0,Fri Jun 5 22:11:13 2015 UTC,"Hmmm, it'd be interesting if you knew me and my family.  The contract wasn't legal, but it was never phrased as ""we're not going to pay for it"", it was genuinely ""Well fuck you, you're going to have to pay for your own travel to college, let's see how long you last.""

That's entitlement. I  actually think you're both assholes. It's not a legally binding contract, so you're not owed anything. For you to demand it is an asshole move. On the other hand, if she just reneged on the deal because she's feeling pissy, that's her prerogative but still an asshole move.   We need more details. What led up to her canceling the deal?

I know my bias in this situation, but it wasn't a big thing. Frankly, relationships aren't her strong point. She's autistic and frequently has temper tantrums. Again, I know my bias, but there's no other way to describe it.  I'd just like the members of this sub to get the chance to observe my family when she's acting up. Apologies, I'm ranting now - it's somewhat painful to try to justify my relationship with my mother while coming under such harsh criticism from this sub. I assumed the ""asshole"" part was hyperbole, but it seems to be the key word that unlocks people generally personally attacking you. I guess I didn't give much information in my defense, but it seems people are still going for kill shots and disagreement downvotes."
AmItheAsshole,38oyls,MaddPony,3,Fri Jun 5 22:59:28 2015 UTC,"You can remember the part that inconveniences you but you can't remember the details of why she's mad. You throw out autism as some kind of excuse when you seem a little spectrumy yourself. Hmm. Anyway..  Part of why people are assuming you're the asshole is because the language you're using implies entitlement. Your family doesn't owe you anything and you going to school isn't you doing them a favor.   I don't think you're the asshole. I think your Mom is being a little vindictive, but ultimately not that unreasonable. You have no claim to that money and even though it'd be nice if she kept her word, you acting like her word is a legally binding agreement just makes you seem entitled and manipulative.  As for all the angry comments, forgive us for being harsh but people try to pull bullshit past us all the time and it appears like you're hiding information so we get super suspicious and assume you're in the wrong. Not necessarily a correct assumption but I think it's part of why people are reacting poorly.  To summarize, no you're not the asshole but you're in danger of becoming one if you don't drop it. Your mother might be double-hitler for all we know/care but that doesn't mean she owes you anything, just maybe that she's a cold mother."
AmItheAsshole,38oyls,ignayshus,3,Sat Jun 6 07:44:45 2015 UTC,"Ok. I can understand where you are coming from because my MIL used to promise to pay for things for my husband when he was in highschool/college and then take it back later. It was shitty because he planned his finances around the fact that she would be paying for certain things. She used it as a way to control him. There was a lot of other bullshit she pulled to maintain control over his life.      Based on what you've said, it's hard to tell if your mom is like my MIL with a pattern of shitty behavior or if this was a one time thing. If your mom constantly pulls stuff like this then she's an asshole, but you're still not entitled to the money. Pursuing it makes you an asshole too. If this was a one time thing, then you're the one being an asshole."

I think you're one of the better judges here, as you understand the context better; I don't think that the rules of standard human interaction work here. She flies off the handle, and though its frequency comes and goes, she has never once attempted to make up once for a situation. Everything is indirect, and via indirect materialistic apologies.  I guess this was the first time she decided to hit me financially, instead of emotionally or physically.  edit: and with that, I think this thread concludes. She's the asshole, and I am equally an asshole if I try to recoup my money (?)"

However, it is not ""your"" money. It's hers. You're only kind of an asshole for acting entitled to that money.          I'll use examples from shit my MIL pulled to elaborate.         Example 1: His mother promised to pay for text books in college. She took back her promise and my husband had to pay for it. He was not entitled to the money. It was not his. He did have a right to be pissed at her.          Example 2: My husband paid half of the money to by a car when he was 16 and my MIL paid the other half. She put her name on the car title for insurance purposes. Later she put a GPS tracker in the car and claimed the car was completely her. She would threaten to take the car back even after we were married. My husband has offered to pay her back for what she spent on the car in order to gain legal ownership, but she refused. He has always been the primary driver if the car. He paid for the car in part and is entitled to the car.         Your situation matches the first example more so then the second. I hope that makes it more clear."

They're insanely prideful of their distinction and can easily forget that most people don't know or care about the different branches of the military. Normally I'd say no one is the asshole here but it sounds like you were bending over backwards for the guy. Least he could do was not be so confrontational about such a small thing, so I'd say he's the asshole... or he was totally kidding and you just missed the schtick. Either way, you're good."
AmItheAsshole,38m3os,DrProbably,6,Fri Jun 5 06:06:13 2015 UTC,Not an asshole. You didn't mean anything by it and he knows that.

AmItheAsshole,38m3os,RevRaven,8,Fri Jun 5 08:11:17 2015 UTC,"No you are not the asshole here. Young marines are taught in training to be offended by it. FWIW, soldiers are in the Army, marines are in the Marines, seamen are in the Navy, airmen are in the air force. I can't stand that either. It allows them to be dicks to people who are trying to compliment them and show respect only to basically slap them in the face. So it's not his fault, it's not your fault, it's his DI's fault."
AmItheAsshole,38m3os,forshow,6,Fri Jun 5 15:19:02 2015 UTC,He is the asshole. I would be like.  Really dude? After all this shit I bent over backwards for you and you say that. Although.. the way he said it to you and his tone is everything. We aren't there. So you're the only one that knows if his tone was serious or playful. Regardless. I don't give a damn what you are in the military.  If you're an asshole. You're an asshole.

AmItheAsshole,38jbn8,bren97122,25,Thu Jun 4 16:30:41 2015 UTC,You have every right to be angry but you're still an asshole for walking out on her. Probably some miscommunication mixed in there too.
AmItheAsshole,38jbn8,polarbearjockey,18,Thu Jun 4 17:17:04 2015 UTC,"I think you need to recognize that she's just not as into you as you are into her. She clearly saw going to prom with you as a ""just friends"" thing, so you have to think of it from her perspective. There's a good chance she just felt super awkward in the situation if you have feelings for her which she doesn't return. Also, if you aren't actually dating or have any kind of romantic connection, don't be surprised when she doesn't want to do a ""couples dance"" with you.  I think she was being inconsiderate, but leaving her there was an asshole move."
AmItheAsshole,38jbn8,bilscuits,8,Thu Jun 4 18:19:44 2015 UTC,"Sure, she was rude - althought I think it's pretty clear that you each had very different expectations of the night, so I wouldn't say her behaviour was too awful, all things considered. The thing is, walking out on someone while they're in the bathroom is a pretty massive ""fuck you"" which, more often than not, is designed to upset and humiliate someone. As soon as you did that, you pretty much wrecked any chance of a genuine apology from her - and, what's more, you gave her a full day to stew on it before apologising to her for how the night went down.  It's very close, but I would say you are the bigger asshole here."
AmItheAsshole,38jbn8,jayguazu,4,Thu Jun 4 19:58:33 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I don't know if anyone's the asshole here. She's not an asshole for not being interested in you, and you're not an asshole for being pissed off. Yeah, there could have been more communication, but in some situations, people are just going to get hurt."
AmItheAsshole,38jbn8,nirenem,1 point,Thu Jun 4 18:05:10 2015 UTC,"How correct do you think I am?  You would be into the two of you getting together.   She agreed to go to the prom with you, but sent you messages that it was not because she was into you or that you should expect it to go anywhere.   The first part of the evening, she got the clear message from you that you would like it to go somewhere.   She was freaked out by this and didn't want you to get the wrong idea, so she pulled away, wouldn't do the couples dance, etc.   It sounds like from the very beginning, she didn't want to hurt your feelings, but couldn't communicate that she was really not interested in you without doing that. She should have stepped up and been more straightforward with you from the beginning. She kind of led you on by doing the prom with you. (But her asshole was in the right place.) You appear to have joined her in this by pushing on when you knew she really didn't want it.   I'd say neither of you are assholes, but both of you need to learn to communicate and read people better."
AmItheAsshole,38jbn8,OsakaWilson,1 point,Fri Jun 5 00:52:12 2015 UTC,"The thing is, we were intending to go somewhere after. Kinda. We were both going to the same after prom event, but I ended up not going because it was too inconvenient for my parents, who would have to take me home from it."
AmItheAsshole,38jbn8,martzfartz,1 point,Fri Jun 5 01:47:09 2015 UTC,"I would have been mad too, but you have to communicate! If you did walk out you should have at least told her why."
AmItheAsshole,38jbn8,SStrooper123,2,Sun Jun 7 14:06:51 2015 UTC,"Don't listen to the people white knighting the girl.  Sure, women don't owe us anything, but there are expectations.  She's still your date, even if it's just as friends, and it's incredibly rude for someone to walk out on you and ignore you the whole night while you're spending you time and money on them.   You can clearly see the bias here because everyone is defending her actions, even though they admit she was wrong, while calling you an ""asshole ' for leaving. Actions speak louder than words, she obviously didn't give a flying fuck about you, so why should you care about leaving?   Take this a learning experience.  You'll find other girls and you'll find good ones who respect you enough to give you their attention. If a girl disappears on you during a date or spends the whole time staring at her phone move on to the next one."

AmItheAsshole,38jbn8,robobreasts,-2,Thu Jun 4 18:34:02 2015 UTC,"She's an asshole.  No one thinks it's actually okay to treat people like that.  She's not into you but is too much of a pussy to just say so, so she strings you along because it's easier for her than outright rejecting you.  What an asshole!  That means it is reasonable for you to be pissed.  However, you then were too much of a pussy to tell her you were upset and say ""I'm leaving now, you need to come get in the car if you are getting a ride with me.""  Instead you didn't tell her how hurt you were (she could then rationalize her assholish behavior as ""not that bad"") and then ditched her.  Two wrongs don't make a right.  You've graduated now.  If I were you I'd apologize for ditching her, just for your own sake.  And then be done with her.  You don't want to be with someone that treats people like that anyway."
AmItheAsshole,38jbn8,robobreasts,1 point,Fri Jun 5 00:02:49 2015 UTC,"The thing is, I did apologize for leaving her. That is when she didn't seem to think she did anything wrong and gave her apology. We really haven't talked since."

However, it does appear that she is a game player, likes stringing people along from a distance, and she just put out a new string.  In a weird way, it sounds like she wants to tell you that if you had been more insistent with her, it could have been you with her now. Almost doing you a favor by letting you know what not to do. Even if that isn't her intent, you can learn from it."

Some people are just broken, they try to evoke pain in others to prove to themselves that they are wanted. My bet is that she is probably a lot less awesome then she has portrayed herself to be, that's why she would never meet you, and this new guy probably doesn't even exist, and if he does, he is much less awesome then she is making him out to be.

She may hide her issues from you, she may not drive a car, or she may drive a shit car. Never meet a person in a suburban area, and if they say they live in the city and work in the suburbs. Run. They are trashy people who don't have anything quality about them.  The point is that everyone has issues, vulnerabilities, whoever they are. Can you see through them or do you find someone with the right type of issues. The ones that don't fuck you up.

AmItheAsshole,38kfr0,ImAgressivelyPassive,1 point,Thu Jun 4 20:40:16 2015 UTC,Nope no contract. The way I see it I'm already paying for stuff I won't be using and the fact that she has the audacity to request even more money from me is a bit ridiculous. Apparently she did some mismanagement with money and some people gave her less than she had asked for in some cases but she never counted. If I'm supposed to feel bad for her fronting money because she didn't keep track of the expenses and the amount she was given - I don't. I'm not going to cover anyone else and I think it should be fair that I get to go to the bus for prom at least.
AmItheAsshole,38kfr0,ImAgressivelyPassive,2,Thu Jun 4 20:44:17 2015 UTC,Idk where you are. I'm assuming not US because of drinking. But you seem to be shit out of luck here because there's no contract. Either fork over the rest or try and get some of your money back. But I doubt you will.

I'll still be allowed in the house when I go I just won't get to use the bus to get to the actual prom location. You'd think I'd get a reduced rate since I'd only be using it for a 15 minute drive from the pre-prom to the prom instead of an hour and a half drive down to the beach and I'm already paying a ridiculous amount for alcohol I'm not drinking but....."

AmItheAsshole,38gxnr,DrProbably,2,Thu Jun 4 05:03:51 2015 UTC,"Brief aside... is there such a thing as ""autistic humor""?"
AmItheAsshole,38gxnr,nadeshdara,2,Thu Jun 4 06:20:18 2015 UTC,"If you mean specifically autistic things that make us laugh, then absolutely yes.  I maintain as a grown-ass adult the capacity to laugh myself into an asthma fit at certain sensations. Poking particular body parts of other people with my big toe is a big thing. I know rationally there's nothing particularly funny about it from an explainable humour point of view, but it is absolutely hilarious to me - not the fact that I'm poking someone (all involved parties are consenting but mildly confused), but just the way it feels to me. I also sometimes have this kind of reaction to particular flavours, I literally choked the first time I was drinking chai because I was laughing so hard.  More relatable to non-autistic people, perhaps, is humour that goes back to particular uses of echolalia, like using particular quotes you usually use to communicate in a place where they don't belong."

We might also have in-jokes, or other humour pertaining to shared autistic experiences - such as ""When you've met one autistic, you've met one autistic."" The mechanism of humour here will be obvious to any non-autistic listener as well. But to autistic people, it also highlights a very basic fact of life. Autism is hard to get a general idea of, because it's so complex and presents in so many varied ways. And yet, it is definitely one of the things people are most happy to attempt to generalise.  I don't personally communicate using stims except in the most basic way, but I presume that they are also used in a humorous/light-hearted fashion between people who do. shines autism batman signal Maybe someone else can explain."

I meant no offense by it and ""autistic person"" seemed a little unwieldy for the sentence. Is that a term that has negative connotations or am I good?"
AmItheAsshole,38gxnr,nadeshdara,2,Thu Jun 4 11:49:11 2015 UTC,"A stim is something like hand-flapping, rocking back and forth, twirling, jumping or similar behaviour. Head-banging, hair-pulling, stomping and so on can also occur. We use these behaviours to regulate our emotions and sometimes express ourselves - for example I flap my hand in a particular way* when I'm so delighted I can barely stand it, rather than expressing that using my voice. When I had worse coping skills, I sometimes engaged in self-injurous stims to help me calm down. So, they are a mix of coping mechanism and communication. *My room mate says she can distinguish my upset from my happy hand-flapping fairly easily, so my stims become an additional avenue of communication with her.  Here is an account by someone diagnosed with Asperger's, and here is an account by a parent.  There is a LOT of controversy surrounding language use in the autism community. In general, you will be safe with ""autistic person"" or ""autistic"". Some autistics prefer the term ""autist,"" but many really hate it. Many parents of autistic children prefer ""person with autism,"" but I don't personally know any autistics with that preference. ASAN has a more elaborate article about the politics surrounding these words here."

AmItheAsshole,38gxnr,JimmyKeepCool,2,Fri Jun 5 00:09:57 2015 UTC,"Other posters have addressed why you're an asshole for looking for an excuse to get physical with him, so I'm going to let this rest and do what you weren't willing to do for Mike: I'm going to help you fill in the obvious gaps in your knowledge.   Firstly: Autism is a developmental, not a mental disorder. Mental disorders such as eating disorders, PTSD, anxiety and depression often  appear alongside autism. Especially in individuals that are considered ""high functioning"" like Mike, the stress of adhering to societal expectations rather than behave naturally can be great.  The higher functioning he is naturally, the less likely he is to have received training for healthy coping skills.  Here are some things the school environment - including you - probably does to Mike that are anywhere from mildly annoying to physically painful to him. - Make him parse sarcasm, figures of speech, rhetoric devices and humour. Expect him to use all the same devices successfully. - Suppress his natural body language. - Expect him to parse the body language of others as part of their communication, and imitate it successfully. Eye contact especially. - Break rules without explaining why. - Change plans he was party to. - Subject him to background noise / flickering lights / any number of painful stimuli, and expect him not to react.  Why does he want to annoy you back? Because you most likely annoy or hurt him every day, all day, as long as you're in the same room together, and he is expected to yield every. single. time.  We're not allowed to retaliate when people hurt us, because they don't know they're doing it. We're not allowed to expect basic accommodation from strangers, because we can't expect them to know the weird things that set us off - although it is certainly expected of us to know the weird things that set THEM off.  Even as an adult, this degree of having to censor my own reactions to being hurt, stressed or just plain annoyed is exhausting. You're a teenager yourself - imagine if the entire rest of the world was Mike, expecting you to fit in with a Mike-like world every day.  But we don't have to imagine: We already know you couldn't even deal with the one Mike without getting physical. And this is WITH support from a peer group you can easily communicate with. This is WITH all social norms being tailored to your advantage. This is WITH ample time to calm down and use your natural stress management skills (which also, unlike Mike, you're allowed to use in public) to overcome your anger.  PS: Getting physically violent with a disabled person because they said something awful (and I agree that that was awful) about the holocaust is doubly shitty."

If he is in fact autistic, he would not be able to immediately understand why something is inappropriate or the impact of his words, but he can still learn and should still face appropriate consequences (beatings aren't appropriate). As you admit, you intentionally antagonized him with the goal of eventually beating him up. That's a shitty thing to do, especially given that the other kid has a developmental disability. As /u/CipherClump said, he probably doesn't see a relationship between his words and getting beaten up. In his mind, he told a joke and then you randomly kicked his ass.

I'll put this in an edit to the OP as well but I just want to clarify that we both actually walked away fine, me with a bloody lip from when he threw something at me. The worst thing I did in the long run was probably the psychological impact he received by someone basically attacking him for something he said.   In his mind, he told a joke and then you randomly kicked his ass.   I understand why this makes sense, but something that I left out was what was revealed in the meetings with counselors and the principle. Without going into detail as to what he said in those meetings I can tell you that this is simply not the case. He was very ashamed of what he said when trying to explain it to the principle, and did not intend them to be jokes, more of a 'specialized annoyance' in order to get me back on task."

To him, being autistic, he has no idea that what he said two days ago could have made you mad.  Then, you escalated the situation.  You brought it from a non physical situation to a physical one.  You could've done any number of things: walk away, tell the teacher, talk to him and try to come to an agreement.  You did none of those, making you the asshole.

As much as I don't want to come off as defending my actions instead of just accepting my assholery, I did leave out some details about his Autism that may have been more important, judging by your interpretation of his side, than I figured at first. While I understand the nature of many cases of Autism, as far as I can tell the inability to connect his actions with the emotional impact on others they may have is simply not as severe in his particular case.  By no means am I claiming to be an expert on Autism but I, along with most people at my school, simply know ""Mike"" better than what can be explained through reddit to a stranger.  There are many other factors at play as well that I chose to omit such as the situation with teachers. The teachers, as frustrating as this sounds, are as bad at letting little things tease Mike in particular as any students are. Not to mention on Friday we actually happened to have a substitute who of course was less reactive than our regular teacher probably would have been, not that that's an excuse.  So... long story short there are details left out that explain certain things better than what you assumed to be true based on what was originally written.

I think that 7 is the main one in which I don't have a valid counterargument for, although I do have an invalid one, haha.  4. Can be prone to fighting and aggressiveness I don't expect you to have read everything in this thread but you will find in other replies of mine my explanation that it's not typical of me to do something like what I did to Mike, and if you read my second edit, you will see that compared to your average high school fight, it was really nothing but for the sake of getting unbiased opinions I called it ""beating him up"" prior to the edit. Calling me prone to fighting and/or aggressiveness is untrue. I mentioned that I come off to most people as chilled out even when I feel frustrated. Regardless of what I feel at any given moment the fact is that externally I'm not aggressive.  5. Has little regard for the safety of others This is a serious jump to an untrue conclusion, based off of what you've read about me. I hold particularly high regard for other's  safety. I'm a boy scout (no way you could have known this); safety is programmed into me. I've yelled at even my closest friends for doing stupid teenager shit because I care about them, whether it's texting while driving or getting a hold of drugs. I take safety very seriously.  7. Doesn't feel remorse or guilt Well, here's my not so valid argument: I do feel remorse and guilt when I should. That's it. Should I feel remorse and/or guilt from this scenerio? You say yes, and I say no. It happened more than a month ago and I clearly was feeling guilty when I posted this, I don't know why anyone would post here if they didn't feel guilty. At this point I've already righted my wrongs (apologies and beyond to Mike) and gotten rid of my guilty feelings by sort of confessing all this shit in the form of asking strangers whether or not they think I'm an asshole, to which the answer is yes, most strangers think I'm an asshole.

There is a limit to how much shit you have to put up from another person if they are not even trying to share a commitment with you. Sounds to me like she just wanted to keep you on the back burner while still getting the companionship of a boyfriend w/o any of the commitment or obligations that entails and there is flat out no reason why you should have to put up with that."

She feels this way because, despite recognizing intellectually that she has no claim to you, her emotions are telling her otherwise. Having had anxiety and depression issues myself, I can understand her point of view.  My advice would be to gently apologize for doing this in a place where she would have to stumble into it, but nothing more. If she attempts to make you apologize for betraying her etc. then calmly explain that you will not be made to feel this way. You understand that she can't be in a relationship, you've been respectful of that, and you don't hold it against her, BUT you have to live your own life and if she wants to remain friends then she must respect that.  Good luck,"

AmItheAsshole,38febl,eternalaeon,6,Wed Jun 3 21:26:22 2015 UTC,You aren't in the wrong. You were honest and open about your feelings and then she told you nothing was coming of it. You can't hide away your life to hold up some image for her that she doesn't want to even acknowledge exists. It isn't fair to you and you are just as important as her in this equation.   Making this illusion that you are never going to date again isn't going to help you for your emotional needs or help her work through the problems she is going through.
AmItheAsshole,38febl,yourpants,2,Wed Jun 3 23:27:58 2015 UTC,You're not the asshole. She's clearly very jealous but probably because she's mad at herself for not opening up to you before this happened. Her loss.

You could've told her you wouldn't hang around her if she wasn't interested but you guys would still be friends I guess, but there's also the whole ""I'm not ready for a relationship but I don't want to let you go"" thing going on there. You're free to do whatever because you're not in any actual relationship, and there was no miscommunication about that.

She lied by omission, sure, but you also responded in a childish way. You're not exactly gaping here, but you are the asshole. Just apologize."

They didn't even have to cook, and yet they still required multiple reminders and made you pay for their dinner? That's fucked up.

He feels he shouldn't have to cook everyday and hardly lets me cook (even though I know how to and its not rocket science)  My mom is off on Wednesdays so she usually does the cooking but because of the whole hospital thing she couldn't. My dad was a bit upset (more like sounded like it on the phone when he found out we had to order) but yeah this is how it goes in the house and I'm so so ready to get the hell out of here, I just need the money. :/"

You're being really over-dramatic by saying there's just no way that you could possibly cook these five-minute raviolis. All you needed was one pot, one hob and five miunutes. Your girlfriend managed to do it, there's no reason why you couldn't. You're also being over-dramatic about her having to ""dance around him"". She was just boiling pasta, for Christ's sake, it's not exactly hard to do while someone else is in the kitchen.

AmItheAsshole,38gbph,atomosk,10,Thu Jun 4 01:27:31 2015 UTC,Your girlfriend is probably annoyed at you for not being assertive and making a simple request happen in the face of an obstacle she easily overcame herself.
AmItheAsshole,38gbph,atomosk,2,Thu Jun 4 02:46:05 2015 UTC,actually she was fine about it.  she knew when she asked me last minute to pick up the dinner items that she might be the one to cook if the kitchen was crowded.  she wanted the raviolis more than I wanted to find an alternative for dinner so that's what wound up happening.  sometimes it's the other way around and I'm doing her laundry because she's had a rough week at work.  stuff like that is never a big deal.

AmItheAsshole,38gbph,rileyfriley,8,Thu Jun 4 07:09:01 2015 UTC,"I think you guys need to have a conversation and set some rules. These can be very simple, if you are gonna use the kitchen for a while make sure there is room for others to do their stuff too, or ask in advance to have the whole kitchen to yourself if you need it, so others can schedule around it. Also you can set rules that in the living room, the TV has the priority for sound and if someone wants to watch something else in the living room while the TV is used by someone else, they have to use headphone to not disturb others. Very easy rules, that any remotely decent roommate should agree with.   By just making passive aggressive comments about your roommate in front of him, you definitely are the asshole. Your girlfriend being completely capable of cooking the dinner with your other roommate in the kitchen proves that. People are normally quite okay with sharing as it is normal when living together, from your story it seems like you are the one who has problems with sharing the common facilities."
AmItheAsshole,38gbph,whodatdan0,5,Thu Jun 4 01:58:16 2015 UTC,"You ask if you're the asshole (which, you are) and then every time anyone explains why, you defend yourself and try to explain why they're wrong.    LPT: don't build things up in your head to make them more stressful and annoying than they really are. And don't make your house situation more tense by being passive aggressive."
AmItheAsshole,38gbph,DrewReaLee,3,Fri Jun 5 00:54:07 2015 UTC,Yes you were the asshole.  You share a kitchen.  Just because the other roommate has more alone time in the apartment doesn't mean you get to dictate when he uses the kitchen.
AmItheAsshole,38gbph,DrewReaLee,-1,Thu Jun 4 13:45:35 2015 UTC,"That wasn't what happened.  In the years I've been living there, I've never once asked him to not use the kitchen.  He uses it freely, whenever he wants to.  My question was, in a situation where I get home from work and want to make dinner, only to find that he is in the middle of a gigantic cooking session with pots and pans everywhere, am I the asshole for asking my girlfriend if we can make alternate dinner arrangements in front of the guy?"
AmItheAsshole,38gbph,Bweiss1234,4,Thu Jun 4 13:52:20 2015 UTC,"am I the asshole for asking my girlfriend if we can make alternate dinner arrangements in front of the guy?   Yeah dude you are being a total asshole doing this.  You made a problem out of nothing.  Your girlfriend apparently has more sense than you and realized this was a non-problem and like an adult she... shared the kitchen.  If you had said to us, ""I asked if I could quickly boil some pasta on one of the four burners and my roommate said no or wanted to make me wait hours"" then he'd be the asshole.  But apparently he is a completely reasonably person and was flexible and let your GF cook no problem.  ""Dance around him"".  Man it is boiling pasta.  Not only that but he has the maturity to ignore your childish comment and continue on and not make a problem out of your ridiculous behavior.  It sounds like you have some pretty deep rooted resentment for the guy because he stays in a lot.  This is his home that he is paying for and he is welcome to stay in it as much or as little as he wants.  The fact that you brought this up is pretty strong evidence that there is some problem with how to think others should act - like you are a control freak that wants him to stay in X hours a day.  Maybe living with roommates is not for you if you really can't handle this."

AmItheAsshole,38gbph,krumskrum,2,Thu Jun 4 02:15:10 2015 UTC,"You're not the asshole, you really just need to have ""the conversation"" with him. If my roommate gets annoyed that he is taking all the burners and the majority of the kitchen to serve a grand feast to Queen Elizabeth II, then there is a serious problem that is probably neither of your faults mainly because you just haven't set your boundaries with your roommate. People grew up with different standards and go about things differently, it's as simple as that. The thing that tells me this in your situation is that your roommate doesn't understand what you're hinting at. That's why you need to talk with him instead of beating around the bush. For instance, my college roommate never closed the bathroom door when he uses the bathroom even though the rest of us do. It's a small thing, yes, but I really don't want to hear you doing your weird and wonderful things while I'm watching Netflix and eating dinner. You just need to set your limitations and respect each other's space, something that can only be achieved after you talk this through with your roommate."
AmItheAsshole,38d14y,megaman1410,43,Wed Jun 3 12:46:32 2015 UTC,"Two things to consider:   She ""lied to people about the price"": No, she didn't. She may have a comically misguided opinion on what constitutes an ""expensive bottle of champagne"", but that's merely a somewhat subjective qualitative assessment; she didn't specify a price, and she's (clearly) not an expert in champagne, so she can't really be held to any objective standards of properly using the term 'expensive' in regard to it. So you were wrong accusing her of lying about the price. You ""stole"" the champagne: I'm not entirely clear if that is actually true. Stealing it implies intent (at least morally) and your prior knowledge that the champagne wasn't yours to take. I take it that there were plenty of alcoholic beverages consumed at that party, at least some of which were probably provided by the host, so it doesn't seem like an unreasonable assumption on your part that this bottle of champagne was fair game even if you hadn't brought it to the party yourself -- unless she had previously stated that the bottle was off limits, or getting to it required you to trespass or break into somewhere, or something similar.   So: Unless there are some relevant details surrounding your acquisition of that bottle of champagne that we don't know yet about, I'd say it was an honest misunderstanding on your part caused by a lack of proper communication on her part, and her behaviour after the party was completely out of line."

He took it (without her explicit permission, I guess), but then again, she was hosting that party and it might not have been obvious that she considered the champagne off limits.

Or if someone broke into something to get to that bottle.)"

A few days after they had already given up trying to find the culprit? What?  You know what, it doesn't even matter. This one is super easy. Sober you is responsible for all the things drunk you does, including taking a bottle of champagne. You then got in a spat with the person you took it from. Were you an asshole? Yes. Were you enough of an asshole? No.  The moment I found out that bottle was so cheap, I'd have chugged what was left of it, thrown it in the trash, and then denied any knowledge or involvement with the situation.

On the other hand, it sounds like very few people had much recollection of anything that happened that night. If nobody can find the bottle, it's possible that someone else took it after you finished pouring. Also, it's £10, clearly something that can easily be replaced without much hassle, and certainly nothing to start a witch-hunt over. Additionally, if she's deleting your defenses, it's very likely she's realized she's slightly in the wrong and doesn't want others to know. I'd say she's the biggest asshole of the group.

So I can say with near certainty that yes, you are the asshole. It is very rare to be able to correct someone's grammar without coming off as an asshole, and frankly I don't think it's worth bothering with. See how I ended that last sentence with a preposition but you still understood what I was saying? Then there's no reason to correct me other than to show off what an obnoxious pedant you are.   Socially speaking, it's also a lose/lose. You can either correct someone's grammar like an asshole and, of course, come off as an asshole, or you can correct someone's grammar politely, and come off as a condescending wannabe professor who adds nothing to the conversation.   There is one notable situation where it's appropriate to correct peoples' grammar, and that situation is when you are a teacher in a classroom.

AmItheAsshole,38hln9,maxzumstein,3,Thu Jun 4 07:17:31 2015 UTC,"I agree with your sentiment, but ending your clause or sentence with a preposition is 100% acceptable in English and has been all the way back since the days of Chaucer."
AmItheAsshole,38hln9,Cuddles_theBear,2,Thu Jun 4 09:24:34 2015 UTC,"In practical use its absolutely acceptable I agree, but I kinda thought that formally/prescriptively speaking that was still a relatively contentious issue. It seems to me personally that if we're going strictly by the rule book we shouldn't be ending sentences with prepositions. I mean I know it sounds weird sometimes to skirt around them, but just TECHNICALLY speaking, shouldn't a preposition have to precede an object in order to be grammatically correct? What's the rationale of it being acceptable?"
AmItheAsshole,38hln9,maxzumstein,5,Thu Jun 4 10:29:54 2015 UTC,"The rationale of it being acceptable is that stranded prepositions have been a standard feature of both written and spoken English since the language's inception, and they are in fact common to pretty much all Germanic languages. The idea that prepositions always have to precede an object comes from a couple of scholars in the 17th century who insisted that proper grammar should look like Latin, which never has stranded prepositions. This idea is of course incredibly stupid, since English isn't Latin-based, it's Germanic. This is also where that ""don't split your infinitives"" myth comes from; infinitives are a single word in French and Latin. There's a good blog post on the Oxford Dictionary website about common grammar myths which has a pretty good explanation of all these.  Specifically dealing with prepositions, Germanic languages have a couple of things that nearly always require that prepositions end the sentence. The first is that interrogative questions, especially those that start with wh-words, actually split the prepositional phrase to surround the question. For example, the question ""You are laughing at what?"" sounds stupid, but you can clearly see that the 'at' is supposed to be paired with the word 'what.' In English, the interrogative word gets moved to the front, but we keep the standard noun-verb-noun construction: ""What are you laughing at?"" The sentence ""At what are you laughing?"" while also grammatically correct, is very strange because it moves to a noun-noun-verb construction, something that is otherwise uncommon in English. The preferred sentence, even in formal English, is thus ""What are you laughing at?""  Germanic languages including English also use prepositions as elements in phrasal verbs. You can even get double stranded prepositions with sentences like ""It's cold, and I have nobody to huddle up against."" The verb is ""huddle up,"" which technically ends in a preposition but the preposition is acting instead as part of the verb. ""Pay"" is a completely different verb than ""pay for,"" for example. At the same time, the word 'against' in the previous sentence is being used as a postposition - you can have something to huddle up with, or huddle up against, or huddle up around, or under, or towards, or inside.  At the end of the day, the issue is that you can't interpret the word preposition literally. They're really just adpositions that usually happen to come before the object. That being said, we already know that we have to take our Latin names for grammatical terms with a grain of salt, since a literal interpretation would imply that adverbs could only modify verbs, never any other part of speech. And that is something that almost nobody would agree with."

Leaving a vague, masturbatory remark that only strives to make OP feel better about himself and the opposing party feel bad about themselves is disgusting. It cannot be defended.

AmItheAsshole,38hln9,wasdtemporary,1 point,Fri Jun 5 06:58:35 2015 UTC,"As a social retard, objectively speaking, I believe the answer is ""fuck no"", even if as far as social situations go humans appear to tend to tell themselves that you are an asshole anyway.  Without addressing right and wrong, it appears to me that if someone says ""much apples"" instead of ""many apples"" for instance, the reason they did so was either because they were ignorant in at least that moment in time of the grammatically correct way to word what it was they said, or they didn't give a fuck about grammatical correctness. I am of the firm belief that if there is even a chance that one does something in ignorance that that ignorance should be corrected and replaced by knowledge, as simply not knowing the correct way to accomplish something could never in itself be better than knowing the correct way to accomplish that thing.  Now... I did say that I am socially retarded, and I did say that objectivity and human tendency are not the same when it comes to this in society. When I first started browsing Reddit I had already known what it was and how its upvote system and subreddit-specific moderation influences behavior but I was utterly blown away by how often someone's post correcting someone else's grammatical mistake and nothing else was met with a massively upvoted ""fuck you"" or similar, a massive downvote bomb, and nothing else. This doesn't only happen on Reddit as well. Many people out there fancy speaking in ebonics or misusing words as using ""literally"" as ""figuratively"" because they respect those who do so, and what I have come to accept about it is that, when it comes to humans, they likely are not doing whatever they are doing in the ignorance you believe them to hold.  I will never be able to understand it, but it appears to me that objectivity doesn't usually if ever matter to the human, and if the human decides they want to feel offended by your correcting them, they will, and they will perceive you as an asshole regardless of the actual fundamental properties of what you've done. My argument is you're not an asshole, as you are proposing to them that their method is inferior and the superior method they should use instead. I see no reason to ascribe the value of ""asshole"" to that concept since it doesn't appear to hold it in itself as it is literally an action that fixes something broken and to find it unsavory would be to disagree with the most basic understanding of what it means to be good. It appears to me that you are helping them become what you perceive the best and are by no means forcing them to conform by simply correcting them. You are doing your part to make the world tend to the end you think is the best and has been established by the human itself to be the best, since grammar is a system created by the human. I don't see how that could be wrong.  As far as most humans are concerned however, it appears to me that they were comfortable with their expression, and you just approached them telling them that you think they should be uncomfortable with it and should change it. As far as they see, all you want is for them to reject their vaguely good emotions to replace it with vaguely bad emotions. I would like to reaffirm though that I am socially retarded and for the record I only came to this subreddit in an effort to learn more into how humans perceived something I said that offended another human, so take what I say with a grain of salt... I am not the one any should turn to to learn of social standards... I don't know why I composed this post, sorry."

""Call me Auntie Ann"" - it was a way of using their first name, and back in the day, we didn't call adults by their first names without permission.

(I learned Japanese in college, and when in doubt you pretty much always address your elders as ""aunt"" or ""uncle"" unless there's some other more appropriate/polite way to address them. It's part of the collective culture they've got, that a lot of Asian cultures have from my limited experience.)  Respecting someone's culture goes a LONG way, particularly if they're immigrants. It shows you care about their comfort. What I would've done is asked your ex's mother what she'd like to be called, but when in doubt, she probably had a better idea of what would make her mom comfortable than you do, and it's minorly asshole-ish to refuse to try what would make her family comfortable, particularly since you yourself say it wasn't that big of a deal to you."

However, if you felt like it was too weird for you on a personal level, you probably should have explained yourself a little further instead of dumping it all on your culture. For example, ""It's makes me feel uncomfortable to call your mom Auntie, because I grew up around a culture that finds calling the parents of their partner familial names weird and gross. I know it's arbitrary but it makes me feel uncomfortable."" Then you could ask her why she thinks it's important. Have a dialogue!"

The equivilant of her calling you, ""Sir StopCannibalismNow"" or something.   Now one could argue that she should make an honest effort to make you feel welcomed, and that calling her ""Auntie"" makes you uncomfortable, but if she's already in an English-speaking Western society, the entire world around her is outside of her cultural comfort zone, and so using the term ""Auntie"" on your part would have gone a long way to helping her understand that you ""get that""."

Don't give someone advice on something they're struggling with if you don't have the full story, she may know very well that she's failing but could have some other side to this that you don't fully understand. Even if she didn't have something else contributing to it besides saying that you're concerned and explaining that her success matters to you, I feel it's not your business to be talking to her about that. You're taking the place of a guidance counselor."
AmItheAsshole,38dybz,chez358,1 point,Wed Jun 3 17:07:11 2015 UTC,We don't have a guidance counselor. Our school is kinda lacking in staff. Last time she mentioned her academics she said I was the first person to talk to her about it at school.

If you care that much, try and proactively ask her how classes are going and ask her about what she's learning. Have intellectually stimulating conversations with her where she can share the stuff she's learning. Some people just have a harder time fitting into academics. She could also be suffering from depression, dopamine deficiencies, or adhd?"
AmItheAsshole,38dybz,RPPUTC,12,Sun Jun 7 16:18:24 2015 UTC,"The issue is that you're putting your nose in her business and then taking it upon yourself to lecture her.

AmItheAsshole,38dybz,ElModeloEnPace,11,Wed Jun 3 17:39:12 2015 UTC,"she can still graduate if she takes extra classes and works really hard (I confirmed this with administration)   This alone makes you the asshole. It's going above and beyond, and quickly ventures into being nosy.  You think you're the first person in her life to tell her this? I'm sure she knows it and hears it from her parents all the time. The responsibility and all of that might be weighting on her, and that's why she's not performing up to snuff.  Instead of offering unsolicited advice you should set the example and offer to help her with stuff. Invite her out to study with you even if you're taking completely different classes. Tact is what separates us from the assholes, so next time keep that in mind."

AmItheAsshole,38dybz,Muffinizer1,6,Wed Jun 3 16:43:39 2015 UTC,"I kinda disagree. I've been, to a lesser extent, in the position of OP's friend. There's a chance she's depressed. She knows everything OP told her, OP just made her feel worse. To me it's not a question of if, but instead of what the deeper issue is. She might improve a bit by trying to ignore it and focus on studies, but she's not gonna be able to really dedicate herself to her studies without solving the bigger issue whatever it is. Personally, I'd try to talk to her to see if you can help her sort through whatever it is, but it's likely that she needs to get through it on her own."
AmItheAsshole,38dybz,SeeDeez,2,Wed Jun 3 21:24:35 2015 UTC,You aren't an asshole for telling her to get her shit together.  But it does sound like you over stepped your bounds with your investigating.
AmItheAsshole,38dybz,Gigadrax,2,Thu Jun 4 04:35:25 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say you're an asshole. Maybe you could have expressed your concerns a little bit more eloquently, but your concerns come from love. You're more of an asshole than her I guess.  I would say focus on being supportive above all else, that no matter how badly they fuck up or fucked up or may fuck up in the future that you want to encourage them to take steps that they strongly feel will better themselves. And be attentive to them and prove that you care about them by being their friend. Because ultimately that's what you are, first and foremost, and you haven't any authority over them. If you must I'd say invite her to study with you or do homework with you. You could even ease into it by inviting her to hang out at first but when she gets there say ""Hey, I just wanna' finish up this homework and then we can do stuff, wanna just hang out in my room while I do this?"" And chit-chat while you do so. Later say ""Hey, it was cool having you hang out while I do homework wanna do homework together?"". Just be mindful that it's sensitive, and remember that graduating (High school?) Isn't super duper important to do ASAP, it won't be the end of the world if she doesn't and it won't do her any good if you even think that it's a bad thing, I know that sounds silly, but she knows it's not a good thing and having her friend not so stressed about it helps."
AmItheAsshole,38dybz,Mechanisedbrain,1 point,Thu Jun 4 07:15:27 2015 UTC,"One of my closest friends is still in high school. I just finished my second year of uni, and all the guys from our group are either working or similarly advanced in their studies. I remember one night when I brought this up, and we had a huge fight. Long story short, he didn't care what his situation was, but he hated anyone else interfering.   If you think your friend would appreciate your advice, then there's nothing asshole-ish about it. Above all, make sure that your ideas of success, moving on, whatever match up with your friend's. There's nothing wrong with saying what you think, but be aware that they are (more or less) a rational self-interest individual, and maybe what they want isn't what you might want for them (or for yourself)."
AmItheAsshole,38dybz,brightblueinky,1 point,Wed Jun 3 22:48:00 2015 UTC,"Your friend sounds kind of like me when I first started going to college. I looked lazy/flaky, but I had undiagnosed depression (and was just recently informed by a doctor that I need to get checked for an anxiety disorder, too). I knew I was screwing up my education, but it was a lot easier to ""choose"" to fail than to try and prove that I wasn't ""good enough,"" so most days it was a struggle just to drag myself out of bed to go to class. I ended up hiding in the library during class time when the anxiety got too much.  This might not be your friend's problem, it might be real laziness, but either way I don't know if telling someone ""get your shit together"" is the best way to handle the problem. They probably already know there's a problem, and from personal experience people yelling at me to do better didn't fix the problem--it just made me give up entirely because I assumed I wasn't a good enough student. It'd probably be better to offer actual help, like offer to be her study buddy or something."

AmItheAsshole,38dybz,ritsikas,0,Thu Jun 4 14:08:57 2015 UTC,"I think you are an asshole. She is doing bad and you going up to her and pointing out all her mistakes, is not helping her. She knows she is doing bad, because she knows what her grades are. If she doesn't care about the outcome then let her be, if she has deeper issues, you should be supportive in other ways. You knowing about how badly she is doing and pointing it out to her is only going to make her feel worse. It is bad enough that she needs to know about it and think about, but have other people point it out to her too that can make her really feel bad about herself, cause now it's not only her who is making her feel bad.   Suggestions on how to talk to her would be: ""Hey how is it going?"", ""You know if you ever want to talk I'm here for you"" (Only say this if you actually mean it though). Never lecture her though.   Ever had the situation where you were going to do some sort of chore at home and then your mom tells you to do it, as if you were being a lazy asshole who never does anything? And then your motivation to do it is at 0%. You might be doing this to her right now, she is aware of the situation and might be already planning or making changes to make sure she doesn't completely fail, but when you come and sort of tell her what she needs to do because she is obviously not capable of coming up with it herself, you are most likely reducing her will to do anything about it."

I don't think you did anything wrong, at least from what I can tell. Seems like he had conflicting feelings and that made things between you two weird. I don't think either of you are assholes in the end.   Also you're 16 so in the long run this won't really matter too much. Try not to worry if one guy is weird."

I really don't want to lose our friendship though.  We became kind of close, and I kind of miss having someone that I can talk to about anything anytime.  I don't have any close friends that I can turn to anymore, my old best friend drifted away from me.  I suppose you're right though.  I should just leave him be, our relationship is probably toast by now, and maybe later I'll meet someone else?"
AmItheAsshole,38ghau,infamous-spaceman,1 point,Thu Jun 4 02:01:50 2015 UTC,"Well since he heard from someone ""2342 is mad at you"" then he probably thinks there are other things you have discussed. Maybe he doesn't believe you. You've apologized and explained yourself. At this point all you can really do is wait. Maybe he just needs some time too cool off. Give it a few days or weeks, then maybe text him or talk to him.   Either he will get over it and you can keep being friends, or he won't and you won't. In the latter case that is probably for the best because maybe he is a bit too high maintenance. As much as you may want to, you can't force a friendship. Some times things don't work out and it sucks but it's just how it goes.   And in any case you WILL meet someone else. You are in highschool, there is a good chance that is 5 years you won't have most or any of the friends you currently have. You will go to college and meet new people."

AmItheAsshole,38ghau,Cuddles_theBear,1 point,Thu Jun 4 06:24:47 2015 UTC,"Okay, I've been on both sides of this situation before, so I think I get what's going on. Of course, I don't actually know you guys and I could be majorly off, but from what I've read I really identify with Logan here and this is what I read into the situation:  Logan feels like shit. He doesn't talk to you because he feels bad when he does so. It's nothing that you did, he just doesn't want to go out with you and knows that you want to go out with him, and he feels bad that he's letting you down and trapping you in the friend-zone. I've been in that position before, hell, I'm actually in that position right now with somebody. The normal response from most people, including myself, is just to stop talking to the other person as much. If my hunch is right here, you aren't going to end up in a romantic relationship with him (unless you do, in which case it will only last a month before he breaks up with you). You can save the friendship, though, by making it clear to him that you do not want a romantic relationship and that no matter what happens you will always be friends.  Of course, he could just have something going on in his life completely separate from you that's making him feel depressed, and he's just talking less to people in general. Either way, I don't think for a second that he stopped talking to you because you did something to make him angry. I think he's feeling depressed, either in general or specifically about you. Honestly, you thinking that he is mad at you is just making the situation way worse because it's going to make him feel even worse, and that will just cause him to withdraw more.  One important thing that stands out is that he keeps saying that he doesn't want to date anybody at all. Here's a big question: why? He may have said that he doesn't want to be hurt again, but I don't think that's entirely true. There could be underlying self-esteem issues, he could be grappling with actual clinical depression, or he could even be struggling with identity issues relating to gender, sexuality, or just his own personality. Whatever it is, I can tell you that you are going to make the problem so much worse if you keep the mindset that he wants to date but is afraid. Having other people think you're broken doesn't help you get out of your funk, and additionally it's going to encourage you to say ""oh, maybe if he trusts me enough I can bring him out of his shell and fix him!"" You're just asking for trouble like that.  Now, as for why he treated you so special and then suddenly stopped talking to you: this one is pretty easy. He enjoys spending time with you, acting flirty is kind of fun, but the moment your feelings towards him go from playful to serious, he's now worried about hurting you. That's why that happened with exactly that timing. He wasn't treating you nicely because he wanted to go out with you, he was being nice because he likes you. Those two things aren't the same.  Everything outside of him being depressed and you being upset is just stupid high school gossip. High schoolers are stupid, and that statement holds for you and your friends and me too when I was in high school. Your friends are literally gossiping based purely on speculation. One person sees you two acting distant towards each other and then they spread rumors that you're fighting. Ignore them, and if you hear somebody say a rumor that you know to not be true, just tell them off. It's none of their business.  And finally, for the big question of the thread, who is the asshole? Neither you nor Logan is an asshole, all the people gossiping based on speculation are assholes."
AmItheAsshole,38c7zn,Used-Up,86,Wed Jun 3 07:41:08 2015 UTC,"It really sounds to me like she was genuinely being nice to you, OP, and it worked out in her favor with the other dude.  If the additional attention came from that other guy and she immediately pushed you away and said ""That's enough of you, loser!"" I might believe that she had some kind of Regina Goerge-esque manipulation planned the whole time, but it sounds like she made a joke, and you made an oversensitive interpretation.    So, for the question of who's the asshole.  The worst thing she can be accused of is ""Friend-zoning"" you...and I don't think there's anything really wrong with that.  Sounds like you needs a friend, and if you treat your relationship that way, it could lead to other friends, and more confidence, and better things.  So she's not the asshole (unless she totally cuts you out of her life now).    You didn't do anything except worry, so there's no reason to call you an asshole.   No assholes here."
AmItheAsshole,38c7zn,flignir,25,Wed Jun 3 10:37:34 2015 UTC,"This is the correct answer here. She never said she was just using you, she said there was an advantage to your friendship."
AmItheAsshole,38c7zn,gurgaue,9,Wed Jun 3 11:57:31 2015 UTC,"Well if her boyfriend really is that jealous, he could push her to push OP away.  So the asshole has yet to reveal themselves.  Look OP, you've been given a friend for now, and on the outside appear to be enough of a ""threat"" to the other dude to be worth dating by someone.  Stop sulking about someone who is taken.  ""Friend-zone"" this girl in your own head, and use your newfound confidence to find some other girl who appreciates you on that level.  This girl may just like wrapping several guys around her finger, take it as a compliment for now.  Most girls love guys who already show they can be social.  They may ask themselves, ""hey if other-attractive-girl hangs out with OP, he must be alright"".  And maybe this friend of yours can introduce you to some other girls so just play it cool.  It's weird for her to be bragging this stuff to you, but it's the opposite of leading you on so I say you can respect that and respect her.  Just respect yourself enough to not fall into unrequited love."
AmItheAsshole,38c7zn,UndergroundLurker,6,Wed Jun 3 15:21:38 2015 UTC,"She was being nice to me, it's just that after a certain point all she would talk about is him and how I'm making him jealous.  Now that they're actually together, she doesn't talk to me as much. But, that's not her fault, really. I'm going through some stuff and I'm not very talkative, I can't expect her to chase after me. That one is on me. Maybe I am the asshole."

You're probably just over-thinking the whole situation. (Don't feel bad, I do the same shit) I'm sure she still values your friendship, but that's all it is. You're just good friends, but that's not a bad thing. Good friends are really hard to come by, so just try to relax and see the bright side to the situation. No, you didn't get a girlfriend, but you made a good friend that genuinely likes you. Sounds like a good thing to me.  Edit: Maybe you should also say something about her always talking about how jealous you make him. If she sees that it's bothering you maybe she'll clarify and stop talking about it.

I want to believe that this girl is not intentionally using you to make the guy jealous, and that her comment was meant as a joke (albeit one made in very poor taste). She truly values your friendship, but also noticed that this other guy was paying more attention to her now and made a facetious comment on it. If this is the case then you aren't an asshole per se, but you are in the wrong.  What it comes down to, in my opinion, is whether or not she is going out of her way to use you. If she is intentionally getting closer to you to make this other guy jealous, then holy fuck she's a terrible person and you are totally right to be upset. I generally don't assume that people act in that kind of amoral, manipulative way, but I don't know her and maybe she's actually just like that. My first instinct though is to assume that she's generally interested in being your friend and simply made an insensitive comment after observing that the other guy was jealous.  You're not an asshole, but I think it is ambiguous whether or not you have a right to be upset with her."

Being an ass hole means you actively did something to someone that is bad.  Your post would better fit into a reddit for, ""Is he/she an ass hole?""  The answer to that is probably yes.  More important in your story is your apparent self pity and defeatist attitude.  It sounds like you want a girl like this to actually be interested in you.  So instead of focusing on this girl and getting upset by her selfish actions... you should take the experience and make something constructive out of it.  Go ask some other girl you know to be single on a date that you're interested in.  If you aren't attractive enough for that then become more attractive first so you have more confidence.

Since this post was created he has added more dumb shit to the list of fuckery that he thinks is okay to do.  He decides that sailing is more important than practicing with another temporary stand-in vocalist (we have two in the band, one is currently sick) when we have a show this Saturday. It has nothing to do with a stand-in stealing his spot, he brought the replacement in himself. But back to the point. He says that showing up a little late is okay when we're running on a very tight schedule, and he's been informed that if he is not there on time, we're canceling our upcoming show because we wouldn't be ready.  He even stated himself when I said ""use your head."" that it was a hard thing for him to do. Amongst previous pleas for him to shut the fuck up because he was annoying everyone.  Third, he insists upon showing up to practice in either just boxers or shorts, meanwhile his back looks like Freddy Kreuger's face (burnt and scarred (bacne only) and thinks it is totally okay to do so). I acknowledge that I'm the asshole for thinking of that comparison, but it's the only comparison I have.  Also he is insistent upon his solutions, even if he has been shown 8 different ways it can go wrong and most likely will go wrong.  And last but not least, he acts like the band leader while having no idea how to even run his own finances and life, but also was not an original member, thinks he knows everything about heavy music and instruments and acts like he is the better guitar player because he can play a lot of Slipknot songs.  In summation, he acts like a dick, treats others like he's above them, and worst of all, is too stupid to comprehend how dumb he's actually acting."

It's really tough to tell where the asshole part of them ends and the mental illness begins.  From being in your shoes somewhat, I've got to say there's not a clear answer.  Are you an asshole for being annoyed?  In my opinion, no.  As long as you understand that the illness is the reason for most, if not all, of his shitty behavior.

If I held the door for two people mid conversation and they didn't acknowledge me, my first assumption would just be that they forgot to say thanks because they were deep in a conversation, not that they were assholes.

AmItheAsshole,38f5ey,DeletedLastAccount,2,Fri Jun 5 00:39:33 2015 UTC,"I don't think you are an asshole, but there are some things to keep in mind.   Outside of a court order the father has a legal right to see his child, and can use evidence of your ""keeping"" your child from him as potential evidence against you in any future custody or visitation reviews. He can try and claim he tried to maintain contact with his child, and you refused him access. Some courts look poorly on this.  If you continue to refuse visitation (if he even bothers to seek it), he can always move for the court to allow it (which will likely be granted with caveats), or even try and force a change of custody, which depending on your circumstances may either be a good or bad thing.  Access to a child is a parent's right, and it cannot be unilaterally denied (outside of a court order) even on the basis they choose not to exercise it.  That's the way it generally is, fair or not."
AmItheAsshole,38f5ey,AirBlaze,1 point,Fri Jun 5 17:29:37 2015 UTC,"The court order called specifically for supervised visitation through the local facility I mentioned in my post.  He would have to call the facility and organize a day/time for the visitation.  From what I understand, he could call today and have it set up without an additional trip to the courthouse.  Now keep in mind he didn't show up to the last two hearings of our divorce/custody agreement, so he never heard this from the judge and I'm willing to bet he didn't read that far into the paperwork if/when it was delivered to him.    I am pretty familiar with the laws in our state regarding custody and visitation--and you are absolutely right that refusing visitation would look poorly on my behalf no matter what the circumstances.  However, I am not refusing the visitation that was set in our court order.  Technically, the blame for this falls on his shoulders as he was the one to cancel the supervised visitation that was court-ordered.  If I received a phone call from that facility tomorrow stating that she had visitation Monday, I guess I would be legally required to bring my daughter to that visit or at least schedule a court date to fight it based on whatever grounds I saw fit.    In our state, it is extremely difficult to change a custody agreement once it has been set.  That requires undeniable proof that the current circumstances have changed and the child is no longer benefiting from those.  Honestly, I don't think he has a leg to stand on in court, and I also don't think he is serious enough about his desire to see her to even bother taking me to court.  If he did take a step that large, I might consider changing my point of view on the whole issue, as that would be a pretty big proof of his dedication.    Edit:  I've heard the argument about his ""rights"" as a parent many times, and to be 100% honest, I just don't give a fuck about them.  I'm more concerned with my daughter's right to have a happy, functional life.  I know you weren't arguing in favor of his rights or anything, just thought I'd throw my two cents in on his rights."

That said, I obviously don't know what your specific situation is like, I was only commenting in my capacity as someone married to a noncustodial parent .  I missed the part where it said he had supervised visitation only which complicates things obviously.   Technically, the blame for this falls on his shoulders as he was the one to cancel the supervised visitation that was court-ordered.   True enough. The law does say that the right of visitation, as laid out is his, regardless of whether he chooses to exercise them or not, which you seem to already know. That's the only point I was trying to make.   I've heard the argument about his ""rights"" as a parent many times, and to be 100% honest, I just don't give a fuck about them.    I get that anger too, but it's pointless. When one speaks of rights I am speaking simply to the legal sense. The rights are his, regardless as to how much you don't give a fuck or how stupid he is at exercising them.     My ex recently contacted me to ask if we could get together outside of court so he could get to know her. I didn't even text him back. As I said before, my child is happy and healthy and I don't want a sudden new daddy to fuck that up for her. My theory is that since he chose when to leave, I'll let HER choose when they meet up. I plan to give her the choice when she is older and I feel she is mature enough.   It could possibly be argued by another party that this is an attempt at parental alienation. He is making an attempt to maintain contact, to which you are not amenable or responsive. It is not up to the child (legally until the age of majority) to decide if she wants to see a parent, but up to both parents to make sure contact is maintained. It looks like he is trying to do so, however poorly, which is the reason I mentioned it might not reflect well on you if he takes legal action.  That said, he really should try to be more on the ball and try and work within the confines of an agreement if possible."
