Graham lives with his wife Molly and their son Kevin in a seaside house and was retired after capturing the notorious Dr. Hannibal Lecktor that affected him and left Graham disturbed. Jack needs Graham to help him to trace the profile of the Tooth Fairy serial-killer that attacks in the full moon and has killed Mmes. Jacobi in Birmingham and Valerie Leeds in Atlanta and their families. Graham discusses with Molly and accepts the assignment, and he immediately visits the crime scenes and the dangerous Dr. Lecktor in prison to seek help to find the motives. Then Graham asks Jack to send his efficient agent Jimmy Price to Atlanta to seek fingerprints in the body of the Leeds family. Soon they learn that the Tooth Fairy has contacted Dr. Lecktor that gave Graham's address to the serial-killer. Will Graham succeed in stopping the killer before the next full moon? (IMDb)   Critical reception:   On its release, Manhunter was met with widely mixed reviews. At first, it was seen as too stylish, owing largely to Mann's 1980s trademark use of pastel colors, art-deco architecture and glass brick. A common criticism in the initial reviews was that the film overemphasized the music and stylistic visuals. Petersen's skill as a lead actor was also called into question. Particularly critical of the film's stylistic approach was the New York Times, which called attention to Mann's ""taste for overkill"", branding his stylized approach as ""hokey"" and little more than ""gimmicks"". Chicago Tribune writer Dave Kehr remarked that Mann ""believes in style so much that he has very little belief left over for the characters or situations of his film, which suffers accordingly"", adding that the film's focus on style serves to ""drain any notion of credibility"" from its plot. Sheila Benson of the Los Angeles Times was critical of the film's visuals and soundtrack, comparing it unfavourably with Miami Vice and describing it as a ""chic, well-cast wasteland"" that ""delivers very little"". The film's stylistic similarity to Miami Vice was also pointed out by Film Threat's Dave Beuscher, who felt it was the chief reason for the film's poor box office results. Writing for the San Francisco Chronicle, Steve Winn derided the film, claiming its lack of a strong lead role caused it to ""fall apart like the shattered mirrors that figure in the crimes"". Time was more favorable in its review, praising the ""intelligent camerabatics"" and ""bold, controlled color scheme"". Leonard Maltin gave the film three stars, calling it ""gripping all the way through and surprisingly nonexploitive"", although adding that ""the holes start to show through"" if looked for ""too carefully"". Manhunter was, however, nominated for the 1987 Edgar Award for Best Motion Picture. (Wikipedia)   Awards: 1 nominations  More info at IMDb, Wikipedia, Rotten Tomatoes, Metacritic, Netflix, Freebase.

(IMDb)   Critical reception:   Todd McCarthy of Variety said Jolie was more affecting than in A Mighty Heart (2007) because she relied less on artifice. He also noted a surfeit of good supporting performances, Michael Kelly's in particular. Oliver Séguret of Libération said the cast was the film's best feature. He praised the supporting actors and said Jolie's performance was forceful yet understated. Kirk Honeycutt of The Hollywood Reporter said Jolie shunned her ""movie star"" persona to appear vulnerable and resolute. He perceived the supporting characters—Amy Ryan's excepted—as having few shades of gray. David Ansen, writing in Newsweek, echoed the sentiment, but said that ""some stories really are about the good guys and the bad"". He said that with the distractions of Jolie's celebrity and beauty put aside, she carried the role with restraint and intensity. Manohla Dargis of The New York Times felt that Jolie's celebrity was distracting enough to render her unconvincing, and David Denby of The New Yorker said that while Jolie showed skill and selflessness, the performance and character were uninteresting. He said Collins was one-dimensional, lacking desires or temperament. He cited similar problems with Malkovich's Briegleb, concluding, ""The two of them make a very proper and dull pair of collaborators.""

It is also a visual concert of images set to the haunting music of 'Phillip Glass'. While there is no plot in the traditional sense, there is a definate scenario. The film opens on ancient native American cave drawings, while the soundtrack chants ""Koyaanisqatsi"" which is a Hopi indian term for ""life out of balance"". The film uses extensive time lapse photography (which speeds images up) and slow motion photography to make comparisons between different types of physical motion. In one of the first examples, we see cloud formations moving (sped up) intercut with a montage of ocean waves (slowed down) and in such a way we are able to see the similarities of movement between these natural forces. This technique of comparison exists throughout the film, and through it we learn more about the world around us. The film progresses from purely natural environments to nature as affected by man, and finally to man's own manmade environment, devoid of nature yet still following the patterns of natural flow as depicted in the beginning of the film, yet in chaos and disarray. Through this the film conveys its key message, which is Koyaanisqatsi: life out of balance; crazy life; life in turmoil; life disintegrating; a state of life that calls for another way of living.     Critical reception:   Koyaanisqatsi has a score of 89% on Rotten Tomatoes out of 18 reviews. In 1983, the film was entered into the 33rd Berlin International Film Festival. In 2000, Koyaanisqatsi was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being ""culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant"".

At the end of the film, Francis Ford Coppola came out on stage greeted by applause, while a telephone on a super-long cord was brought out and set before him on a stool.  Upon quieting the audience he explained that a call had been put through to Paris, where a 91-year-old Abel Gance was waiting on the line. He suggested that since Mr. Gance could not be with us to celebrate the screening of his restored masterpiece it would be fitting for him to at least hear what we thought of it so that he could be a part of the wonderful night. Coppola then held up the phone toward the audience, the entire house rose and exploded in an extended ovation of applause and cheers that went on and on and on for several minutes.  I have never experienced anything remotely similar in my entire life. (The night also included the surreal experience of waiting in line outside behind John Belushi and sitting next to Lauren Hutton and Richard Gere inside Radio City.)"

Fullmoviesonvimeo,24hfdg,StairwayToTruth,1 point,Fri May 2 00:36:42 2014 UTC,"Napoléon (1927)      a.k.a. Napoleon (1927)  Biography, Drama, History, War [USA:G, 4 h 0 min]  Albert Dieudonné, Vladimir Roudenko, Edmond Van Daële, Alexandre Koubitzky Director: Abel Gance Writer: Abel Gance    IMDb user rating: ★★★★★★★☆☆☆ 7.3/10 (4,688 votes)   A massive six-hour biopic of Napoleon, tracing his career from his schooldays (where a snowball fight is staged like a military campaign), his flight from Corsica, through the French Revolution (where a real storm is intercut with a political storm) and the Terror, culminating in his triumphant invasion of Italy in 1797 (the film stops there because it was intended to be part one of six, but director Abel Gance never raised the money to make the other five). The film's legendary reputation is due to the astonishing range of techniques that Gance uses to tell his story, culminating in the final twenty-minute triptych sequence, which alternates widescreen panoramas with complex multiple- image montages projected simultaneously on three screens.     Critical reception:   Napoleon is widely considered to be one of the greatest and most innovative films of the silent era. Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports that 92% of critics have given the film a positive review, based upon 12 reviews, with an average score of 8.7/10, making the film a ""Certified Fresh"" on the website's rating system.

Fullmoviesonvimeo,22ucjm,csharp1990,4,Sat Apr 12 08:07:15 2014 UTC,"POSSIBLE SPOILERS  Rough.  Rough to watch.    I always wonder, whenever I hear of an incident in which a human being murders another, what were the circumstances?  What was the situation (in which, let's say one individual kills another) that brought them to do this?  Did the person instigate the situation?  Was it impulse?  In the documentary, I think it was fair to show backgrounds of both boys.  How each of their paths led them to one point, in the same classroom, in the same moment.    I'm not entirely sure either of them had a really fair shot at life.  However, this does not deter from the fact that a kid was killed in cold blood.    One of the most important questions I have is, what did Larry do that made Brandon want to do this?  Did Larry humiliate him to the point that Brandon felt there was no other way to remedy the situation?  Was Brandon personally offended that Larry could express himself and he couldn't?  Was Larry's forward nature a facet of bullying (and I don't use that word lightly) or was he just so confident he felt he could walk up to any boy he liked and tell him so?  I have a hard time with the whole should-a-juvenile-be-tried-as-an-adult argument.  If a kid commits an adult act, then yes, I do think he/she should be tried.  You are old enough to know better about the consequences of an action.  But, there is something broken in the mechanism.  The kid(s) had to be taught that there are 7 billion people on the planet and that we're all different and it's okay.  It's okay to be gay, straight, trans, lesbian, bi etc.  We haven't arrived at that point yet.  So... what's the answer?    When something like this happens it's not two lives that are affected.  It's many, many, many digits and the ripple effect is huge.  Have we learned anything?  Do we know that when we bring people into the world that we have to teach them about community, love and respect for your fellow human being?  It's an individual quest that isn't always addressed because of a myriad of different elements.  One kid is behind bars with ""the incident put behind him"" and another kid is six feet under.  I can only hope that when someone sees an incident like this it'll make them empathetic or think about another person's situation.  Empathetic to the fact that not everyone has it easy.  Not everyone is gonna get the breaks in life.  But everyone has to find a way to navigate this thing with the brain and the body they've been given.  They didn't choose their brain.  They have to choose how to use it with help along the way."

When Larry died two days later, his murder shocked the nation. Was this a hate crime, one perpetrated by a budding neo-Nazi whose masculinity was threatened by an effeminate gay kid who may have had a crush on him? Or was there even more to it? Looking beyond all the copious news coverage of this tragic event, Valentine Road tells the story of two victims: the deceased and the murderer. With keen insight, the film connects the human wreckage of Larry's and Brandon's troubled lives-both physically abused, both from broken homes, and both searching for a sense of belonging.

Blow-Up (1966)  Drama, Mystery, Thriller [USA:Not Rated, 1 h 51 min]  Vanessa Redgrave, Sarah Miles, David Hemmings, John Castle Director: Michelangelo Antonioni Writers: Michelangelo Antonioni, Michelangelo Antonioni, Edward Bond, Julio Cortázar    IMDb user rating: ★★★★★★★★☆☆ 7.7/10 (32,240 votes)   A successful mod photographer in London whose world is bounded by fashion, pop music, marijuana, and easy sex, feels his life is boring and despairing. Then he meets a mysterious beauty, and also notices something frightfully suspicious on one of his photographs of her taken in a park. The fact that he may have photographed a murder does not occur to him until he studies and then blows up his negatives, uncovering details, blowing up smaller and smaller elements, and finally putting the puzzle together.     Critical reception:   Bosley Crowther, film critic of The New York Times, called it a ""fascinating picture, which has something real to say about the matter of personal involvement and emotional commitment in a jazzed-up, media-hooked-in world so cluttered with synthetic stimulations that natural feelings are overwhelmed"". Crowther had reservations, describing the ""usual Antonioni passages of seemingly endless wanderings"" as ""redundant and long""; nevertheless, he called Blowup a ""stunning picture – beautifully built up with glowing images and color compositions that get us into the feelings of our man and into the characteristics of the mod world in which he dwells"". Even film director Ingmar Bergman, who generally disliked Antonioni, acknowledged its significance: ""He's done two masterpieces, you don't have to bother with the rest. One is Blow-Up, which I've seen many times, and the other is La Notte, also a wonderful film, although that's mostly because of the young Jeanne Moreau."" Of the film's ending, Roger Ebert wrote: ""What remains is a hypnotic conjuring act, in which a character is awakened briefly from a deep sleep of bored alienation and then drifts away again. This is the arc of the film. Not 'Swinging London.' Not existential mystery. Not the parallels between what Hemmings does with his photos and what Antonioni does with Hemmings. But simply the observations that we are happy when we are doing what we do well, and unhappy seeking pleasure elsewhere. I imagine Antonioni was happy when he was making this film.""

Fullmoviesonvimeo,1zh14n,parrotforpresident,2,Mon Mar 3 22:23:40 2014 UTC,"Thank you very much for posting this link.    It was a good watch.  I didn't care for the stop-motion animation but I know there needed to be a bridge between subjects.  I'm not well-read on Burroughs, yet, but I wouldn't mind dipping into that pot.  I know very well that once you do something, it can't be undone.  And it can be very damning to be either cautious or extreme.  It seems like he was extreme in his own constitution.    It's very difficult to think that every person has a means of expression and some can't filter it in particular ways.  His expression was through words but ultimately there is also a want for a physicality.  His struggle for that is very present in this doc.  Edit:  The minute I saw John Waters I was extremely excited.  I knew the film had just been amped up quite a bit.  Not only is the man a terrific writer and director, he is an outstanding historian.  I could listen to him talk for a very, very long time."

Burroughs: A Man Within (2010)  Documentary [1 h 27 min]  Fred Aldrich, Laurie Anderson, Amiri Baraka, Jello Biafra Director: Yony Leyser Writer: Yony Leyser    IMDb user rating: ★★★★★★★☆☆☆ 7.0/10 (641 votes)   William S. Burroughs: featuring never before seen footage as well as exclusive interviews with his closest friends and colleagues. Born the heir of the Burroughs' adding machine estate, he struggled throughout his life with addiction, control systems, and self. He was forced to deal with the tragedy of killing his wife and the repercussions of neglecting his son. His novel, Naked Lunch, was one of the last books to be banned by the U.S. government. Allen Ginsberg and Norman Mailer testified on behalf of the book. The courts eventually overturned their decision in 1966, ruling that the book had an important social value. It remains one of the most recognized literary works of the 20th century. William Burroughs was one of the first to cross the dangerous boundaries of queer and drug culture in the 1950s, and write about his experiences. Eventually he was hailed the godfather of the beat generation and influenced artists for generations to come. However, his friends were left wondering, did William ever find happiness? This extremely personal documentary breaks the surface of the troubled and brilliant world of one of the greatest authors of all time. ""William S. Burroughs: A Man Within"" is the first and only posthumous documentary about this legendary figure.     Critical reception:   The film is a Critics Pick at New York Times. Stephen Holden from the New York Times says, ""“A Man Within” is embellished with scratchy line drawing that evokes Burroughs’s skeletal vision of humanity. There is not a word or image wasted in a documentary you wish ran an extra half-hour beyond its condensed 90 minutes."" (Wikipedia)     More info at IMDb, Freebase, Wikipedia, Netflix. I am a bot.

Cleric John Preston (Bale) is a top ranking government agent responsible for destroying those who resist the rules. When he misses a dose of Prozium, a mind-altering drug that hinders emotion, Preston, who has been trained to enforce the strict laws of the new regime, suddenly becomes the only person capable of overthrowing it.     Critical reception:   The film received mixed reviews from critics. The review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reported that 37% of critics gave the film positive reviews and an average rating of 4.8/10, based on 83 reviews, with the consensus being ""Equilibrium is a reheated mishmash of other sci-fi movies."" Metacritic reported the film had an average score of 33 out of 100, based on 22 reviews. The New York Times dismissed Equilibrium for having heavily borrowed from Fahrenheit 451, Nineteen Eighty-Four, Brave New World, and other science-fiction classics. Roger Ebert, however, awarded the film 3 stars out of 4, noting that ""Equilibrium would be a mindless action picture, except that it has a mind. It doesn't do a lot of deep thinking, but unlike many futuristic combos of sf and f/x, it does make a statement."" On IMDb, the film gained a very high user rating of 7.5.

(2004) [USA:R, 1 h 47 min] Documentary, Music  Anton Newcombe, Courtney Taylor-Taylor, Joel Gion, Matt Hollywood Director: Ondi Timoner; Writer: Ondi Timoner    IMDb user rating: ★★★★★★★★☆☆ 7.7/10 (4,238 votes)   Tracks the tumultuous rise of two talented musicians, Anton Newcombe, leader of the Brian Jonestown Massacre; and Courtney Taylor, leader of the Dandy Warhols; dissecting their star-crossed friendship and bitter rivalry. Both are hell-bent on staging a self-proclaimed revolution of the music industry. Through their loves and obsessions, gigs and recordings, arrests and death threats, uppers and downers--and ultimately to their chance at a piece of the profit-driven music business--how each handles his stab at success is where the relationship frays and burns.

Fullmoviesonvimeo,1sid06,paranach9,5,Mon Dec 23 03:57:34 2013 UTC,"These guys arguably pioneered the new ""hipster"" movement. In the film, Anton even claims to be the reason why The White Stripes or any of the new garage rock stuff became popular in the 00's."
