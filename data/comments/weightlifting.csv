weightlifting,3e4y9t,scootereater,4,Wed Jul 22 02:23:54 2015 UTC,"On related note, when Vladislav Rigert shows around Taganrog in Klokov's early vids, he mentions Zakharevich wandering into the gym while returning from beach and rack jerking 200kg in slippers as well.  For those wondering who Yuri Zakharevich is, look his lifts one Youtube, def. one of last great USSR lifters.  http://www.catalystathletics.com/article/1873/The-Ballsiest-Weightlifter-in-History-and-You/"

weightlifting,3e3r65,TravisCooper77kg,31,Tue Jul 21 18:56:07 2015 UTC,"Is it true the first time you ever squatted, you were able to do 400lbs?"
weightlifting,3e3r65,tgandtm,47,Tue Jul 21 19:02:51 2015 UTC,"Not the first time I ever squatted, but I squatted 405lbs on my first max-out day in high school. I was 14 years old and weighed about 145lbs. (I wrestled in the 140lb weight class that year so I know I wasn't more than 145lbs)"
weightlifting,3e3r65,watchthegaps,28,Tue Jul 21 19:07:31 2015 UTC,Casually squatting 405lbs at 14 years old.

weightlifting,3e3r65,watchthegaps,3,Tue Jul 21 22:30:16 2015 UTC,Exactly :( when I was 14 I was still learning how to wipe my own ass
weightlifting,3e3r65,dynawhey,4,Wed Jul 22 00:25:10 2015 UTC,I'm 30 and still shitting my pants so don't you worry little man.
weightlifting,3e3r65,EndlersaurusRex,11,Wed Jul 22 00:27:57 2015 UTC,"As someone who still cannot squat 405, teach me your magic ways :("
weightlifting,3e3r65,plarah,5,Tue Jul 21 19:51:44 2015 UTC,It's fairly simple.  1) get a time machine. 2) get parents with better genetics.  One of those two steps is harder than the other one.
weightlifting,3e3r65,EndlersaurusRex,7,Wed Jul 22 00:16:58 2015 UTC,"Better genetics for squatting, specifically.  At least my parents gave me the ability to be really, really good at Mario kart."
weightlifting,3e3r65,Bedhead03,5,Wed Jul 22 00:23:29 2015 UTC,So Glenn's stories are true. Thats awesome.
weightlifting,3e3r65,Bedhead03,4,Tue Jul 21 19:09:36 2015 UTC,I too would like to know if this is true. Glenn seems to think travis was born to squat so i'm leaning on the side of it being trueish
weightlifting,3e3r65,throwaway_0728,18,Tue Jul 21 19:07:11 2015 UTC,Don't really have any questions. Just keep doing what you're doing and being awesome!
weightlifting,3e3r65,Bedhead03,9,Tue Jul 21 18:59:40 2015 UTC,Thanks!
weightlifting,3e3r65,GrecoRomanStrength,16,Tue Jul 21 19:22:07 2015 UTC,"Ok, ill ask it, can you give us the low down on your role coaching the pakistan team? How did that come about? What did you learn from it?"
weightlifting,3e3r65,Bedhead03,63,Tue Jul 21 19:23:56 2015 UTC,"I coached Kulsoom Abdullah at CrossFit Atlanta for a couple of years. She started lifting for fun and eventually qualified for the Nationals. At local meets back in the day we used to lift in sweat pants and t-shirts before the sport grew. So she lifted in modest clothing, but no one thought twice about it until she qualified for nationals.  Once she qualified we realized she wouldn't be able to wear the attire required at meets. She ended out appealing the IWF which got approved! She ended out being the first Muslim woman to wear modest attire in competition at the 2011 nationals.   She has rare duel citizenship with Pakistan and they asked her to be the first woman to compete for their national team ever. I was able to go coach her at worlds and Asian Championships which was a great honor to be able to watch both of those meets and coach at both.  Now Muslim women are allowed to dress modestly enough to compete in weightlifting, and recently there have been some internationally competitive lifters using the new clothing rules.  Before she competed for Pakistan no women had ever competed in weightlifting. The following year 75 women competed in a national championship in Pakistan with her picture on the back drop!"
weightlifting,3e3r65,rightcross,18,Tue Jul 21 19:43:49 2015 UTC,This is actually a really cool story.
weightlifting,3e3r65,Bonersfollie,8,Tue Jul 21 19:45:02 2015 UTC,Dude that is awesome. Literally brought weightlifting to a whole subset of a country.

weightlifting,3e3r65,Bedhead03,5,Tue Jul 21 21:18:35 2015 UTC,"I'm sure you know this, but you did an amazingly wonderful thing for the sport, women, and maybe even US-Pakistani relationship"
weightlifting,3e3r65,James72090,15,Tue Jul 21 22:07:21 2015 UTC,On a scale of 1 to 10 how much does Glen Pendlay like Salsarita's

weightlifting,3e3r65,Eugen_sandow,10,Tue Jul 21 19:18:24 2015 UTC,Definitely true. Same can be said for Waffle House.

weightlifting,3e3r65,RugbyDork,7,Tue Jul 21 21:04:01 2015 UTC,Have you considered becoming an Olympic banch specialist?
weightlifting,3e3r65,RugbyDork,11,Tue Jul 21 21:06:54 2015 UTC,"Hey Travis,  Love your instagram posts! Anyway, whats your favourite assistance exercise for the Jerk?"
weightlifting,3e3r65,watchthegaps,14,Tue Jul 21 18:59:19 2015 UTC,"I think that the push press from the front is a great exercise. You do not have to have a huge push press to be good at the jerk, but it is an exercises that will assist the dip and drive. Being strong overhead will give you more room for error if your dip and drive is not perfect."
weightlifting,3e3r65,SergiyWL,9,Tue Jul 21 19:05:16 2015 UTC,"I've been to several MDUSA meets (not competed, I'm not an Olympic lifter), and can honestly say you're one of the best role models in any strength sport I've met. Thanks for being awesome and kick some ass at nationals!"
weightlifting,3e3r65,roblsheep,8,Tue Jul 21 20:26:49 2015 UTC,"Thanks, that means a lot"
weightlifting,3e3r65,Bedhead03,8,Tue Jul 21 20:31:29 2015 UTC,"Hi Travis! When I do jerks, my back heel tends to come inward and my toes go out (like a warrior pose in yoga), do you know any good cues to fix that?  I think it's ankle mobility, so any good stretches would be good too!  Thanks, lift on!"
weightlifting,3e3r65,ihatejackblack234,8,Tue Jul 21 19:03:27 2015 UTC,Your heel should be off the ground in the jerk so you shouldn't need a lot of ankle mobility. I think doing presses in the split or jerks from the split to enforce correct footwork would be your best bet.
weightlifting,3e3r65,zenlift,8,Tue Jul 21 19:12:48 2015 UTC,"Thanks again so much for doing this AMA Travis! Best of luck at nationals, hope to see 191 fall!   What are your top 3 favorite meets that you competed at?  Current favorite lifter in the world?"
weightlifting,3e3r65,very_nice_how_much,9,Tue Jul 21 19:03:31 2015 UTC,"Pan Ams 2013, Pan Am Games this year, and 2010 World University games were my favorite meets."
weightlifting,3e3r65,mnolan942,8,Tue Jul 21 19:16:01 2015 UTC,"Hi Travis, hope you're well. Don't mean to offend you but, when I watch you compete you look quite nervous at the barbell before your lifts. If so, do you find those nerves help or hinder you?"
weightlifting,3e3r65,GrecoRomanStrength,10,Tue Jul 21 19:14:13 2015 UTC,"I'm not nervous I just take a long time to lift the bar, but I usually lift about the same as my heaviest lifts from the training cycle at the meet. With that being said I have accurate expectations of my performance there isn't usually any big swings either way."
weightlifting,3e3r65,MaxPowerDC,5,Tue Jul 21 19:19:01 2015 UTC,So all the movement beforehand is sort of just reinforcing positions for yourself? Or just how you get down :)
weightlifting,3e3r65,Timsgym,8,Tue Jul 21 19:23:24 2015 UTC,"I would prefer not to take as long, but for some reason I have developed a long and twitchy routine. I will change it one day so that I lift faster."
weightlifting,3e3r65,ItsaAlex,6,Tue Jul 21 19:31:49 2015 UTC,"Hey Trav, I follow you on instagram, love seeing your lifts as well as the progress some of the people you coach privately are making (not to mention gorgeous cat Kilo).  What is your fondest memory so far in your weightlifting career?  I'd especially like to know who you enjoyed competing with or against the most."
weightlifting,3e3r65,GrecoRomanStrength,8,Tue Jul 21 19:04:46 2015 UTC,"The first time I clean and jerked 175kg I was at the OTC training with Henry Woodard and Steve Jarvis. It was on the competition platform that was used in the 1996 Olympics. They both cleaned it and missed the jerk, and I ended out making it for a huge PR. They both snatched a lot more than me though."
weightlifting,3e3r65,droshake,6,Tue Jul 21 19:20:59 2015 UTC,"Hey. How do you imagine the future of weightlifting? What will be the next big changes in the sport (change in popularity, removed or new lifts, different technique, etc.)?"
weightlifting,3e3r65,ledinred2,10,Tue Jul 21 19:11:43 2015 UTC,"I don't think the lifts will change. The snatch and clean and jerk compliment each other very well. I would like to think weightlifting will continue to grow. I would like to be a coach so it would be nice if that remained a reasonable career path from a financial stand point.  It's hard to anticipate technique changes, but undeniably technique has evolved to improve efficiency since the rule changes of 1964 and 1972."
weightlifting,3e3r65,puumba1,6,Tue Jul 21 19:25:20 2015 UTC,What's your best strict press?
weightlifting,3e3r65,leaReMehT,5,Tue Jul 21 23:38:23 2015 UTC,"Hi Travis!   Well done on your pan am games performance, how was it competing in Toronto compared to some of the previous host cities?   Also I just want to say you are what i believe is the epitome of someone who just keeps his head down and works hard and takes the challenges that come to you without moaning or complaining.   Love the podcast, Snow day being my favourite episode, you and James just chatting and cracking jokes was a great listen.  Thanks!"
weightlifting,3e3r65,cabebedlam99,10,Tue Jul 21 19:03:23 2015 UTC,"The Pan Am Games is the best weightlifting meet I have ever been to. It was like a mini Olympics. The whole experience was like a dream, and the euphoric feeling you experience being there is indescribable. If I could have come home with a medal I would have said the trip was perfect, but hopefully I can go back in 4 years to get a medal.   Thanks for the support. We are trying to do our part in growing the sport."
weightlifting,3e3r65,GrecoRomanStrength,5,Tue Jul 21 19:09:06 2015 UTC,"Hi Travis, when you get to your level of weightlifting it seems harder to add kilos to your best lifts. Why do you think this is? What are the biggest challenges you face when trying to increase your PRs, and what has been most effective?"
weightlifting,3e3r65,Yukers,11,Tue Jul 21 19:16:17 2015 UTC,"The 80/20 rule applies to any skill. You will get to a high percentage of your best results ever fairly quickly in this sport. The last 5 or 6 years you compete you aren't going to hit any major PRs, but you will improve your consistency which will allow you to hit your highest totals by putting your best lifts together in competition.   I have reasonable expectations. I think that gives me an advantage over people who overestimate their abilities. People who have unreasonable expectations are always stressed about their lack of progress which actually hinders long term progress.  Staying injury free is the key to success. Train hard and avoid injury."
weightlifting,3e3r65,the_empty_circle,5,Tue Jul 21 19:29:17 2015 UTC,What was your attempt plan at Pan Ams? What would have been ideal?
weightlifting,3e3r65,Elodin15,8,Tue Jul 21 19:17:23 2015 UTC,"Before I left we had planned for 142/146/150 in snatch, and 181/186/191 in clean and jerk. I wanted to make sure I built momentum into the competition so we settled on 140/144/146 in snatch. After snatch I felt great and still anticipated 190kg being in the tank in clean and jerk.   As I started warming up my legs felt weaker than usual (a common theme among the teammates there probably due to tons of walking and bus rides). We opened at 179 to stay ahead of the guy who got 3rd since he opened at 178. Unfortunately, I wasn't crisp on my opener and pressed it out. This had me following myself without much rest so I had to battle for this weight.   I am happy to come back and make the weight even though I probably had more in the tank. Sometimes it doesn't go perfect, but there will be more meets!"
weightlifting,3e3r65,stevbee,3,Tue Jul 21 19:37:03 2015 UTC,Do you ever bump weight after a first attempt miss for the sake of rest?
weightlifting,3e3r65,Timsgym,6,Tue Jul 21 19:39:17 2015 UTC,"I would have preferred to bump in weight after the opener to get rest, but it was not my choice and based on the strategies chosen I fought my hardest."
weightlifting,3e3r65,HMNbean,4,Tue Jul 21 19:47:29 2015 UTC,"Hey Travis, any advice so people with busy schedules and on a budget, I'm a 26 father/student/full time worker, I only have time to work out 2-4 times a week I just want to make sure I'm utilizing my time to its max. Thanks!"
weightlifting,3e3r65,Turnupthesun,7,Tue Jul 21 19:48:49 2015 UTC,Don't try to train more than you can handle. Training twice a week is better than over doing it with a busy schedule and getting hurt! Ultimately sets and reps aren't as important as longevity so just have fun with it.
weightlifting,3e3r65,Guiltyjerk,4,Tue Jul 21 19:58:13 2015 UTC,How was it living with James Tatum?
weightlifting,3e3r65,Lavistao,9,Tue Jul 21 20:15:18 2015 UTC,"Living with James was very easy. He is a good guy, and we are both pretty laid back people. James and his wife decided to have a baby so I moved out to give them space to grow closer as a couple and pursue parenthood."

How do you/the other guys feel about the battle between him and Glenn the Internet made into a big deal?
weightlifting,3e3r65,snakesnake9,7,Tue Jul 21 20:18:59 2015 UTC,"I have no problem with Jon. He is a unique guy, and I can enjoy being entertained by his videos. I don't see him much anymore, but if I saw him I would make sure to catch up.  The internet seems to exaggerate a lot of issues."
weightlifting,3e3r65,dynawhey,4,Tue Jul 21 20:27:14 2015 UTC,What will be the  next American  Record  to be broken?
weightlifting,3e3r65,TheBaconBurpeeBeast,5,Tue Jul 21 20:28:57 2015 UTC,Darren Barnes will probably get the first shot at nationals at 113kg snatch
weightlifting,3e3r65,TheBaconBurpeeBeast,4,Tue Jul 21 20:31:51 2015 UTC,"Do you ever wrestle, at least recreationally for fun anymore?   I really enjoy wrestling, however, since I started goals of being a competitive weightlifter, I completely dropped wrestling, mostly due to injury concerns.   Have you done this too, or do you wrestle Pendlay to the ground?"

I own the sport training bar and love it. For a while I suggested people take a look at the Rogue bar since I had heard good things about it, until I realized it was in the same price point as the Eleiko. The Pendlay is a nice bar if you want to go to a slightly lower price point and don't mind not having the center knurling."

weightlifting,3e32jc,descartesbedamned,10,Tue Jul 21 16:08:03 2015 UTC,"It's important to understand the source of your sciatic pain as it could be a number of things. Bulging discs, tight piriformis muscles, and SI joint disfunction are among the more common causes.  Piriformis stretches are easy to do on your own and free, so you can start with those and go from there. If you don't feel any improvement after a few weeks of regular stretching then a visit to your doctor and an MRI would probably be your next step."
weightlifting,3e32jc,BruneyTheBrawny,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:48:28 2015 UTC,I agree on stretching the piriformis.  Tight piriformis can compress the sciatic nerve and mimic sciatica.  Try pigeon stretch.  Glad you're also seeing a doctor though in case it's more serious.
weightlifting,3e32jc,apricotpajamas,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:53:46 2015 UTC,Would you know about bulging discs? I had a buddy ask me and I couldn't tell them anything aside from getting it checked out.
weightlifting,3e32jc,ToastedWonder,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:12:04 2015 UTC,"That's probably the right way to do it. When I'm giving advice to people, if it comes down to anything that can't really be solved via stretching or mobility work, I defer to a doctor's opinion"
weightlifting,3e32jc,grizz281,3,Wed Jul 22 00:12:32 2015 UTC,"Without knowing more what I would recommend is...  1) Ice the low back (assuming you have low back pain and referred pain down the leg).  Every couple hours for 15min.  2) Walk frequently, relatively long stride, relative quick pace (within what you can handle).  3)  Avoid bending/lifting/twisting/prolonged sitting (20mins max)  4) McKenzie's position: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBOp-ugJbTQ  5) Piriformis stretches / myofascial release  (if you can comfortably get into these positions): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dl474z1bhnk"

This is a sub for olympic weightlifting. r/fitness and r/bodybuilding would probably be best suited for this kind of advice.   Anyone have any tips/etc?   Johnny Candito has a good beginner strength program you could follow: http://www.canditotraininghq.com/free-strength-programs/  Stronglifts and Starting Strength are also very good beginner programs.  http://stronglifts.com/5x5/ http://www.muscleandfitness.com/workouts/workout-routines/4-week-guide-starting-strength  If that's not what you want I'd just make a workout revolving around the power/compound movements and throw in some accessory movements afterwards.   2-days a week: Upper-Lower split.  3-days a week: Squat, Bench, Deadlift.  Just keep it simple, theres no reason to do a million different accessory exercises. Focus on the compounds!"
weightlifting,3e4awi,natarem,18,Tue Jul 21 21:12:12 2015 UTC,I am under the impression that it was his choice.  I highly doubt they would kick out the top 69 and american record holder because he had a bad competition.  I think he just wanted a change of scenery.
weightlifting,3e4awi,dynawhey,3,Tue Jul 21 21:14:18 2015 UTC,It can also be a difference of opinion. He wants to do things one way while the program coaches instruct differently. Lee has trained with plenty of coaches so he probably has a solid opinion on how to move forward.
weightlifting,3e4awi,ronniedowd,3,Tue Jul 21 22:43:31 2015 UTC,"This could be. Norik has stated in interviews that he himself struggles with every coach he's ever had as far as programming and how to go about things for him. Went on to explain that Zygmunt and he (Vardanian) had to both make compromises in order for them to work together.  Knowing this, I'm sure Alex is in the same boat. He has had a rough past couple meets and might think getting away from the OTC will be more beneficial for him."
weightlifting,3e4awi,semipr0,0,Tue Jul 21 22:49:12 2015 UTC,I had suspected this might be a reason. I looked back up his older performances and noticed there was a bit of a drop.   I don't suppose you'd know this but do you know of any other athletes who left the OTC and did better? Just out of curiosity.

weightlifting,3e4czj,BUCKETOFMAN,2,Tue Jul 21 21:26:54 2015 UTC,"This happened to me too. You have probably spent alot of time sitting down during the time you were away from the gym so your hip mobility is a bit rusty. Take some time to stretch/warm up your hips, ankles, hamstrings, and lower back before you start your workout. Maybe try some front squats for the time being. Your flexibility will come back. I promise."
weightlifting,3e4czj,leaReMehT,2,Tue Jul 21 22:55:24 2015 UTC,For me it was tight hamstrings/glutes. Starting my sessions with back extensions and a few static toe-touch stretches really help. I sit a lot for work so it's something I have to do every time I lift.

If you have to butt wink when you get just below parallel, you don't have good mobility. If you get pinned when you're doing cleans then squat first.

weightlifting,3e1rto,steelsoldat,8,Tue Jul 21 16:20:01 2015 UTC,"So, up until recently I would always squat after my workout. Sure my legs would be a little tired but I always saw that as the whole point. However, I lost about 7-10kgs and my strength kind of went with it so I started doing Catalyst Athletics 9 Weeks of Heaven cycle that involves squatting before the classic lifts every single day (usually up to 85% for reps, or 90% for a single).   My legs go into the lifts a little tired. Maybe this is just me, but when I'm hitting doubles or triples at 75-85% after those squats it makes me feel like I'm getting stronger and that my one rep can be higher once I reach the end of the cycle. I also really enjoy that the squats help me feel loose heading into snatches. Even after mobility and warming up I used to feel sort of stiff while warming up my snatch."
weightlifting,3e1rto,Asakura_,2,Tue Jul 21 12:21:00 2015 UTC,"I do a very similar routine, and can attest to feeling much more loose and flexible in my snatches after I squat.

I'm sure it does slightly, but I still can feel fresh and strong to get my lifts done."

weightlifting,3e1rto,c4lmlikeab0mb,5,Tue Jul 21 15:39:28 2015 UTC,"What is the purpose of squats in your workout? Squats can be used to get your leg strength up, as a warm-up, to get blood flowing at the end of a workout, to focus on balance and stability and so on. Depends what the focus of your workout is. The volume, intensity and frequency of your squat workouts should reflect their purpose. No point going all-out on squats if it is just a warm-up to the main focus of your workout: snatches. No point going heavy if you just want the blood flowing.   I recommend pause parallel squats. May have to start light."

weightlifting,3e3mxd,simacna,2,Tue Jul 21 18:26:50 2015 UTC,Looks like you are concentrating on thigh bumping the bar too much and too early.  Clean pull under without dipping or bouncing it off your thighs - start moving your feet out (make sure not to jump forward like in your video) and aggressively shrug then pull yourself under while keeping the bar close.  Also no body contact cleans can be great for this - will help you be more patient before 2nd pull.  Just keep bar close then after extending body shrug and pull yourself under just like in previous exercise.
weightlifting,3e3mxd,MaxPowerDC,2,Tue Jul 21 21:56:56 2015 UTC,Extend the first pull longer.  You let your knees come in to start the second pull too early.  The knees need to stay back longer.  This is also why you jump forward.
weightlifting,3e3mxd,bulldog73,2,Wed Jul 22 00:58:05 2015 UTC,"Everyone is pretty much right, your first pull is too fast. And if you notice you raise your butt on the first pull (some are supposed to, you should do less). Instead focus on slowing the first pull and being more upright  You may be thinking, ""But if I don't raise my butt the bar will hit my knees!"" Not if you're being more upright in your torso.  Also, you have a lazy upper back as will. That's why your barbell hits so low on your in the 3rd extension cause you're letting the bar stay lot by not firing your upper back and shoulders."

Obviously you're getting a discount bar but for the cost you really can't beat it for most all of their equipment. I wouldn't necessarily expect them to last a lifetime (although they could depending on usage and they have a lifetime warranty just in case) but for the largest majority of lifters they will work.

From my experience, this comes from a variety of factors, including: insufficient mobility, especially in the hip flexors and thoracic spine; too much power in the hips, which causes the bar to go too high, which causes the bar to crash down into the lifter when they catch it low; low front squat strength relative to posterior chain strength; fear of pulling yourself under the bar with a lot of weight; jumping rather than sliding; and losing core tightness."

Also consider taking some lighter % lifts from the hang or the blocks and just really put the focus on a quick turnover and strong lockout.

I'm not so quick to write-off this coach like other posters, especially since you have had good progress. If he/she is a good coach, they likely have a long term plan for your progress. Just because they're not addressing your immediate issue, doesn't mean they're not caring. It might not really be important for you at this point. I also don't see what front squats really have to do with your ability to stand from a snatch, unless you're front squatting less than your best snatch.   What you should do, as I previously mentioned, is ask him/her what the plan is to fix your snatches, and allow you to stand up better. You can report back with that information, and analyze it for yourself.   Also, consider the history of the coach. Have they trained national caliber level lifters before? Or are you the first lifter?   We really need a lot more information to make recommendations on your behalf. Coaching is an involved process."
weightlifting,3dzp4a,GrecoRomanStrength,4,Mon Jul 20 22:15:13 2015 UTC,"There is the problem. He wont change anything in the future. I have had the same plan for a year now, like every other team member, besides talking to him about it. Some other members have the same issue. The frontsquats are the only squats we do and my squatsnumbers have not improved. My snatch is now at 90% of my frontsquat.  And my clean and Jerk is 100%. I manage to get under more weight, just wont stand it up. He has been coaching for 40 years now, has been a masters worlds silvermedalist himself and brought up an olympic champion. But we found out that they had the same plan as we do now. He teaches us a lot and is very knowloedgeable, but seem s to be too stubborn."
weightlifting,3dzp4a,GrecoRomanStrength,2,Tue Jul 21 06:55:31 2015 UTC,What is your current squat frequency? Would you mind to tell us the actual lift numbers as well?
weightlifting,3dzp4a,GrecoRomanStrength,2,Tue Jul 21 11:35:27 2015 UTC,"Frontssquats on Friday. 3-5Reps/3-5 sets as a rough guideline. Backsquat:147,5 FrontSquat:115 Clean and Jerk: 115 Snatch: 100 from Hang/95 off floor"
weightlifting,3dzp4a,NoviceSpanishMaster,2,Tue Jul 21 14:55:06 2015 UTC,"That's not unheard of, but is certainly light for squatting. Your numbers look good with respect to your strength.   How do you feel about the progress this coach has gotten you overall? Having a coach that can teach you proper technique is very valuable, and would be a shame to lose someone like that, even if they hold back your strength.   For about a year, my backsquat was stagnant 143kg, if even that. My coaches, one a former Olympian, would make me back squat or FS at the end of every session, usually to a heavy triple. Although in that year my technique improved a good amount and my lifts themselves, my squat did not.  I broke away, and squatted on my own- notably, I started sets of ten at 114kg, increasing every session. Within about 1-2 months, I squatted 143kg for 10, and my 1RM increased accordingly.   Do you think you can find the time/place to do squats without the coach watching? Could this be a better alternative than completely ditching the coach?   Do you think you could provide a video of you and/or teammates training?"
weightlifting,3dzp4a,OFWGKTA_69,2,Tue Jul 21 15:15:38 2015 UTC,"I am actually quite happy with him, besides that topic.He teaches us a lot of good stuff and analyses our lift and explains it to us in detail.I ll talk to him and explain why I think i would benefit from extra Squats/Strength. Will see how he reacts and let you guys know. Thx for your help so far."
weightlifting,3dzp4a,RugbyDork,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:37:51 2015 UTC,"Those are very similar to my numbers but I don't have a coach, and I stagnated in my jerk, so I can only blame myself  now. I do squat every time I go to the gym. I tend to respect coaches and follow the program, but I also ask, politely, many questions ""to learn"". I would start an ongoing respectful conversation with him about the sport and the trade, and every now and then ask about his plans for your shortcomings. When I had a coach he used to tell me: ""you think too much, you read too much, you ask too many questions"" but we had become friends by then and it was always light hearted complaints with a smile."

weightlifting,3dzp4a,OFWGKTA_69,2,Tue Jul 21 19:18:52 2015 UTC,"It sounds like this isn't a very good relationship. He should take your feedback and work it into the future of your program. If you feel like you've stalled because of his programming and he won't adapt it to your needs, you may need to look into getting a new coach. HOWEVER, that is a worst-case scenario for some people because they don't have a lot of options in their area. Maybe ask to have a trial period where he makes your requested changes and then evaluate at the end. Like, a 6 week cycle with extra squat work. Personally, I would reach out to other coaches if he's not willing to budge at all. Good luck!"
weightlifting,3dzp4a,jaargilon,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:46:18 2015 UTC,Unfortunately he is the only coach around. We have a league system here and its fun to compete once in a while and the experience really helps. Do not want to give up all this because of the coach.

weightlifting,3dzdvs,Swolosaurusrex,2,Mon Jul 20 20:14:12 2015 UTC,"Did your feet leave the ground?  I am a fatty that cant squat jerk.  I mean, I can sort of do it while warming up with the bar, but not with any speed or weight.  I am always curious if power/squat jerks should be feet leaving the ground and moving further apart or only heel coming off the ground with toes staying in place (or no heel coming up), so no movement of the feet."
weightlifting,3dzdvs,phat1forever,2,Mon Jul 20 20:08:07 2015 UTC,"In general, feet should move out a bit. Going up on toes is not really desired, but have a strong stomp into the ground is (without floating in the air).   Power/Squat Jerk is a lot about precise positions, and incredible speed getting under. Not so much about getting on toes for bar height or anything.   I'm on my phone, but I can show you pictures of what the extension looks like for elites."

weightlifting,3dzdvs,PrepaidMexican1,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:11:09 2015 UTC,"Here is a collage  Apti really doesn't chance foot-stance during his jerk, you're right. He does come off his heels a bit, perhaps more than Lu, but definitely is never airborne.   Man, look at how completely flat-footed Dimas and Kakhi are too. That bottom image of Kakhi, he is sightly airborne. Dimas never looked airborne.   Comparatively, this is what it looks like when you do it wrong."
weightlifting,3dzdvs,GrecoRomanStrength,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:28:20 2015 UTC,"So yea, that is what I sort of meant by the whole heel coming up toe staying thing.  I don't actually mean to consciously think about it, but it is something that just happens.  I know coaches often stress making noise with feet when you do a split jerk or Snatch.  I assume with no feet moving/getting airborne, there isn't much in the way of stomping or noise generated in either the squat/power jerk.  I power jerk up to like 70% of my PR.  Sometimes I get air, sometimes I leg drive up and just get under without the feet really going in the air or moving too much.  Not sure which is the better way."
weightlifting,3dzdvs,phat1forever,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:46:22 2015 UTC,The better way is the one that gets more weight up.

weightlifting,3dw3mm,IHAVETEHCRABZ,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:44:09 2015 UTC,The biggest thing I see is the movement with your feet. When starting out it looks like you're too far back on your heel which causes you to roll forward onto your toes. Keep those feet flat through the entire dipping process. Last thing I'll say is keep a strong core throughout the entire lift. You look a little wobbly through the whole jerk.
weightlifting,3dw3mm,fu_gravity,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:54:19 2015 UTC,"That shrug, exemplifying ""Well, shit."" without saying a word.   Everyone's already said this. You dip forward.

Maybe it clicks for you as well."

weightlifting,3e0juj,xvxRob666,7,Tue Jul 21 01:39:44 2015 UTC,"I started weightlifting thinking that I didn't have to prove anything to anybody, and therefore I did it solely for myself. But I also wanted to learn well and improve my lifts. You can take this approach and be happy with it and it is perfectly ok. Your call. I think I was lucky that I found a coach that pushed me to compete and discover the sport. He only had to push me the first time. After that I have inscribed myself in four more competitions and my girlfriend has taken up weightlifting partly out of a desire to compete alongside with me.  It has taught me many, many things and it would get long to describe properly. I now think that weightlifting for training and for competition are two different things. Imagine you like Pool and train alone a lot, you learn wonderful tricks and get pretty good at pocketing the balls, you learn a lot and you feel good about your skill on some days. But you are missing what Pool really is! You are missing on the thrill of the game itself, you have never lived the atmosphere of a true game in a real bar, the experience of the place and of meeting the same-minded crazy people. You have never felt the joy of getting something deliciously right, not alone by yourself, but in the thrilling context of a challenge with another human. You also have never learned the skills required to play a game, a different set of skills than to train alone. You need to learn the tacticts and strategy to know how others are going to play, the psicological game and the skill to read your opponents bluffs or body language or training level, You need to have developed nerves of steel for when things seem to go awry and you only have an attempt that counts, you have to learn to read cards, to time your warm-ups, to choose your starting weights wisely, to adapt and change the weights, to push yourself to limits when it really counts, not just when you are feeling strong. To learn the real technical rules of what makes a valid lift or not and live and strive by it. You have to learn to control your mind and your heartbeat in front of a crowd (and why not! to greatly enjoy the experience of being pushed and cheered by strangers) You have to learn to make weight and control your nutrition, and on, and on. So many things that are weightlifting and never happen in a gym.  All of these lesson will give you a far greater understanding as an spectator of the sport too (and you know you like to watch Ilya compete) and it will give you greater enjoyment from greater insights and knowledge.  Most importantly, it will also will have a very positive reflection in your training. You will enjoy it more, you will study and structure it more, it will have more progression, direction and meaning because you will immediately have goals and deadlines. And this doesn't depend one iota if you make national level numbers or just go to beginner competitions like me. So in the end you will, in all likelihood, progress more and lift more, and this is fun as hell and the reason you like to train hard. To improve.  Competing is scary, all of these May sound overwhelming, and will require that you put your ego in check and learn to humble yourself and control it, but still dream and believe in yourself. This alone, without all of the added benefits would make the effort to compete worthwhile. But it may be scary at first. Many things are, at first. Think about it this way, if you wanted something cosy for a hobby you would have picked origami, since you are here to get strong, why not go for the whole ride and let the sport make your mind and your will much stronger too? Why not go for the whole personal growth and not just muscles and sinew?  I could go on with many more angles, but training weightlifting and the sport of weightlifting are two different things and there is much more than meets the eye to the sport.

As someone who is barely mediocre at weightlifting I ask myself the same question every time I'm at a meet because I'm worried that I'm gonna embarrass myself. My friend/coach encouraged me to and each time it has been an unexpectedly rewarding experience. 1) Get to watch some other really good lifters in person which is fun/Be very humbled by the weights and efforts of other athletes. (seen some really amazing children push physically and mentally through some really tough attempts). 2) I get to challenge myself to really focus and concentrate when a lot of things are going on around me and I have a specific moment to try to perform as opposed to the gym 3) Foster the friendship I have with my friend/coach 4) It's a deeply satisfying moment of personal growth for me to approach many fears and anxieties (as someone who hasn't challenged himself in this way before)  You should do it because you want to rather than someone else's expectations. It sounds like you've tried it before, but if you haven't giving it a shot isn't a bad (albeit expensive) idea/way to figure out what you might like about competing."
weightlifting,3e0juj,Fleshgod,2,Tue Jul 21 01:14:59 2015 UTC,I don't compete and I don't really plan on it (maybe later) but it's fun to compete against other people and trying to win.
weightlifting,3e0juj,dynawhey,3,Tue Jul 21 01:02:48 2015 UTC,"I didn't care for it until I did a house meet and had a blast. Some people find it terrifying and the lead up stressful. Others love the high it gives from smashing a PR in front of a large crowd. I loved fighting for the lifts and having everyone making noise, cheering, encouraging et cetera. I loved the fanfare, the attention and positive energy around it all.  I would compete every other week if my body allowed."

weightlifting,3e0juj,bulldog73,2,Tue Jul 21 12:48:07 2015 UTC,"Why compete?  I think you learn a lot more about yourself as a person.  You learn who you are, how you react in stressful situations, and how competitive you really are.  Some people thrive doing comps, others find it's not for them and don't compete after that first one.  You'll never know until you actually commit and compete.  And, the stressful stuff you mention?  Nothing compared to real life!!  Those are minor.  Registering is nothing more than a few clicks, same with finding and registering for a meet.  The travel I could maybe think of stressful, but I like travelling too much, and meeting new people interested in weightlifting at meets is too much fun, IMHO!!"
weightlifting,3e0juj,camilo202,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:56:40 2015 UTC,"I've been training on my own for about a year without a coach and just recently competed. Competing was a very humbling experience for me. It showed me that even though I hit impressive totals at my gym, they do not transfer outside of the gym. I saw people in weight classes below mine warming up with my opening weight. Competing taught me that even though i came a long way, I still have a long way to go. It made me realize that I can not ignore my weaknesses, and that I absolutely need to work on them in order to really hit the impressive numbers. I've completely revamped my entire training regimen, diet, and recovery methods in order to get to the next level. I don't think I would have had this change in mindset if I didn't compete. Now I'm done focusing on competing with others, and competing with myself."
weightlifting,3dysyf,VFL_13,10,Mon Jul 20 17:12:20 2015 UTC,"The AO is a national level meet, so I suppose saying someone who competed at the AO is a ""national-level lifter"" or ""nationally ranked"" isn't wrong, it isn't saying a lot though. Not sure what I'd think about university nationals...maybe a ""university national level lifter""....either way who cares. Fuck it call em all ""national level"" it's not wrong and until they are top 3 no one will really notice either way :)"
weightlifting,3dysyf,goosepimplez,4,Mon Jul 20 17:23:32 2015 UTC,"I just want to address everyone saying ""whether or not they impress me is another story"" and ""only A session matters/there's a huge gap"" and perhaps better word their feelings.  Anyone competing at AO and Nationals is a national level lifter. However when you have so many athletes as the US currently does qualifying for the event, the A session tends to house the athletes on the cusp of or currently at the INTERnational level. Of course there's a gap. Nationals is a check in the box to achieve an A session athlete's goals. Everyone else's goal IS nationals or improving their position at nationals from the previous year.  This is kind of what the Russian's system of Master of Sport quantifies/quantified, I'm not sure if they still use it."
weightlifting,3dysyf,aeva_siga,3,Tue Jul 21 00:33:20 2015 UTC,"Qualifying for the American Open may be easier than Nationals (or the Arnold), but it's certainly National Caliber. I wouldn't hesitate to call an athlete who has competed at any of those three a nationally-ranked athlete (even if it is like top 50 or some shit).   University Nationals is different, in my opinion, because the qualification for that event are geared towards college athletes, and as such, anyone who qualifies for that, but not the other meets, is simply a nationally competitive collegiate.   There's also certainly a difference between competing and being in the fray of the A class, but that shouldn't really be relevant to any but the smallest subset of fans."
weightlifting,3dysyf,EndlersaurusRex,3,Mon Jul 20 17:30:20 2015 UTC,"so with the AO and Nationals having +3 sessions in the 77-94 categories i feel either the totals should have gone up consistently like the 62s but I would feel like only A sessions should be consider national level athletes as our country we will mostly have 77-105+ athletes that will represent us internationally. It is a great accomplishment and great environment to lift at, but the gap is huge from B to A session."

Now, there is a LARGE difference between the top 3 and barely qualifying.  But still, qualifying is not something that should be diminished.  Similar to sports.  It's like saying the people who have to win entry tournaments to get into Tennis Grand Slams and stuff are amateurs (ignoring actual, legitimate amateurs).  Well, they are miles and miles better than me at Tennis."

I pick a do-able weight for my opener, and I gradually (over the course of 6 weeks or so) get to where I can double that opener for two sets and I can make a single with it in my sleep. Then a week out I hit those openers, some heavy pulls, some heavy squats. For the week following that I do light work working up to 60-70% at most for 6 singles or so in two-three sessions.   On competition day, I've already hit my openers so beyond getting on the board, the sky is the limit.   Thats how I prepare personally. This tactic was taught to me through a coach that trained under Dragomir in the 90's. It's not broke, so I'm not trying to fix it."

weightlifting,3dz5u2,RugbyDork,2,Mon Jul 20 21:32:24 2015 UTC,"Just an idea: you could try the Catalyst starter program with an hour of low intensity steady state cardio on each off day except Sunday (High-Low template). Lifting every day is great and all but not necessary to make great progress as a beginner. The cardio will help with your weight loss and increase work capacity so that you can do high frequency high volume programs in future without wrecking yourself. If you pick stationary bike or rower and are disciplined enough to keep the pace slow (120-130bpm is all you need to reach to achieve maximum stroke volume) it can even help with recovery somewhat. This is what I've started doing at the moment as my ""pre-season"". This gives you a little bit more latitude to push the accessory work which can build muscle more efficiently than Olympic lifting every day can (because it's not limited by your technique)."

weightlifting,3dvczs,erpel_,2,Mon Jul 20 16:19:32 2015 UTC,He could've won silver with an easy 170+210. The percentage model USAW uses is perhaps objective but it's not smart for comps like this. When you base your rankings on the world standard you have to adjust for country of origin for a PanAm champs. For SHW men there's simply less higher level competition going on.  Now ultimately I don't think it's THAT important in this case since all lifters sent could have medaled. But it should still be favored practice to weigh statistics beforehand. If you're trying to ascertain the competitiveness of your lifters for a Pan-American championships you can't base that off predominantly European/Asian lifters.
weightlifting,3dvczs,fu_gravity,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:54:58 2015 UTC,"That makes sense.

All would have trounced 2nd place's 376 total.   The selection for the games was based on the percent of bronze medal winnings for the past 5 worlds/olympics.  Perhaps it should have been a percent of the past 5 pan ams/games, although this is hindsight."

I was lucky and mine slowly opened up until it became unbearable. I have a gym buddy who's hernia tore open violently when squatting and his guts went everywhere.  If I were in your shoes I would push to have the surgery now and find a good surgeon. The smaller it is the easier it should be to fix, and I'd rather be out a month or two now instead of being out several months later on because it blew out when I was going for that PR squat.  One thing you should know that they didn't tell me before surgery is that long-term post-surgery pain is pretty common for hernia repairs. They tangled up some nerves in the mesh patch they used to patch me up and I couldn't squat or run or do abs for two years without a lot of pain and swelling. I still get occasional twinges of pain in certain positions and movements (side planks, split squats) four years later. My buddy, however, had a much larger tear and was pain free a month post-op.

weightlifting,3dwiii,bulldog73,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:08:27 2015 UTC,i have been having the exact same problem as you and for me it was just speed under the bar.
weightlifting,3dwiii,howching,1 point,Mon Jul 20 07:05:51 2015 UTC,"You could have been faster, but the bar being forward still would have resulted in missed lift.  Like the guy above said, too straight, you need to bring it back into your body!!"

weightlifting,3duyrf,rebelofbaby,9,Sun Jul 19 18:56:01 2015 UTC,"If you're really struggling, in the last week to 10 days, look into water loading. You need to drink roughly 1L of water per 10kg of bodyweight every day, then cut it out in the last 24h. Cutting out fibre seems to help in the last 1 or 2 days, too. Would advise getting support with this from a nutritionist if possible. Sounds like you'll be more than fine though, 3kg in a month for you shouldn't be too hard just by reducing carbs and eating slightly smaller portions."
weightlifting,3duyrf,zpablos,5,Sun Jul 19 23:58:03 2015 UTC,"1 month should be plenty of time to lose 3kg, especially since you only have to stay that way for a few hours. What's your diet like?"
weightlifting,3duyrf,BraveryDave,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:32:22 2015 UTC,2 meals a day. Whatever I feel like eating. Trying to reach my protein goals without eating too much. Lately tho I can't say no to some things. Thanks to Ramadan we had some good food lol. I hope I can discipline myself and lose some water weight when I cut the carbs.
weightlifting,3duyrf,BraveryDave,6,Sun Jul 19 19:47:30 2015 UTC,I think you answered your own question. Be more disciplined and cut the carbs a little and you'll be fine. 3kg over with a month to go isn't a bad spot to be in.   Read this: http://www.pendlay.com/Making-Weight_df_84.html
weightlifting,3duyrf,hippynoize,2,Sun Jul 19 19:49:58 2015 UTC,How was training during Ramadan? I personally found that I still had a lot of strength but almost no endure to continue past a heavy single or double
weightlifting,3duyrf,sollevatore,2,Sun Jul 19 21:17:54 2015 UTC,Just watch your portions in the next few weeks and do a water load the week of. Here's a good method.
weightlifting,3duyrf,bulldog73,2,Sun Jul 19 22:11:45 2015 UTC,"Dude, you're totally fine.  I lost 7lbs in a week to make weight for Master's Pan Ams!!  I actually missed making weight during the initial weigh-in by .2kg, then went down to pee and chew gum to spit for 25 min.  Came back and re-weighed in at 76.92kg.  I didn't know much about rehydration, so the meet sucked.  Take some pedialyte (2 bottles, mix one with protein) for right after weigh-ins.  Do the water loading technique outlined below and you'll be fine.  For now, start getting strict with your diet (meaning, start dropping carbs) and reduce some volume to account for slightly lower energy and you'll make weight, no problem!!"
weightlifting,3duyrf,bulldog73,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:05:45 2015 UTC,7 pounds sounds a lot. I am going to end up losing that much too I guess. I am planning on going to a Turkish Bath (hammam) it is something like a steambath. We are going to travel to another city by car. So I am hoping to lose some weight during the ride too.
weightlifting,3duyrf,heartcoke,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:03:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I don't cut nearly that much anymore.  Usually, I just start cutting carbs like bread and beer about 2 weeks out, then slight water manipulation if I have to drop that last lb or so."

I tried to cut down to 69 at 5'7"" for the longest time, lost tons of strength, gave up and now I hover between 78kg and 80kg happily, ready to cut down to 77kg for my first meet when it comes.   Doesn't make sense for me to try for 69kg again if none of my lifts qualify me for anything yet, still working at it though!  You're trying to qualify for a national meet,is it these values?:  69kg 233kg  77kg 250kg"
weightlifting,3duyrf,phat1forever,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:15:49 2015 UTC,"I am 5 ft 8 in. Sadly in Turkey we don't have many lifters so totals are really low in order that new lifters can experience the competition because there are no local competitions. I don't think anyone other than me will compete just for fun. Our federation has a weird way of listing totals but I think It is 155 for 69 juniors. Here are qualifying totals for my federation. Pink table is women blue is men. First  column is U15 then it goes youth, junior, senior. Koparma is snatch, silkme is clean and jerk. Edit: Fuck I don't know how to reddit"
weightlifting,3duyrf,tanklifts,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:39:44 2015 UTC,"Ah good luck then! I'm sure you'll make weight, if you're already 72kg you'll be fine. I knew someone trying to make 69kg that was 71kg the day before and ended up making it (ran around the block in a trash bag, spit into a water bottle, etc). Just avoid the carbs and load water like others said."
weightlifting,3duyrf,tanklifts,2,Mon Jul 20 09:15:46 2015 UTC,"3kg should be doable.  With Ramadan, a lot of it is bloat.  Get back to normal eating habits and increase your water intake back to normal levels.  You will find yourself likely down a kilo just based off that.  Then, cut back a hair to lose like another kilo.  Then, do a water cut the week or so before and you should be good to go."
weightlifting,3dt84p,phat1forever,8,Sun Jul 19 05:49:14 2015 UTC,I live in a Muslim country and there is this one girl in my gym who is a national level 58 kg lifter . She fasted the whole month too. Like you she just dropped the load and didn't lift too much weight. I don't know her program but I usually saw her starting with squats which really seemed weird to me. Maybe she was just testing the waters to see if she feels good for classical lifts. I don't know. She lifted 6 days a week. She didn't train whenever she didn't feel like training. It is just amazing how you guys could train like that. Don't give me water for a day and I am done. Not gettin out of the house that day lol. Eid mubarak bro.
weightlifting,3dt84p,rebelofbaby,5,Sun Jul 19 07:52:38 2015 UTC,"Eid Mubarak. Yea, there is one older guy in my club (mid-40s) who was still lifting like usual. I remember he said he still hit like 130/160 as an 85kg, which is near his top now. I asked him how he handles Ramadan and lifting and he would always be like, ""Brother, you accept the fast and continue with your day."" Uhh yea buddy, thanks for the pep talk. You are a badass, understood lol.   I definitely did squat first on several occasions for that exact purpose of seeing if I had the strength to go any bit heavy. I had several times where I would snatch and CJ the same exact weights."
weightlifting,3dt84p,respiritu,1 point,Sun Jul 19 11:45:12 2015 UTC,"I spoke to him about Ramadan this weekend. He was saying his weight was around 81-82 on Saturday morning and he had to work to get it back up to 83 by meet day Sunday. His snatches looked so so, but his strength didn't seem to stop him from standing up with 160kg cleans... He is nuts haha, definitely a badass!"
weightlifting,3dt84p,respiritu,2,Tue Jul 21 17:58:01 2015 UTC,"yea, he told me his biggest focus during Ramadan was to just maintain strength.  He said he would squat and do pulls and the lifts from blocks or whatever.  It helps to have 30 years of technique practice so you dont have to work at it, unlike me who with only 1 year of technique work, has to work on strength and form.  Also, nice job Sunday."

weightlifting,3duq87,SexistFlyingPig,2,Sun Jul 19 19:14:32 2015 UTC,"I have FAI and have had surgery to correct my torn labrum in my left hip. You can do what you can to give yourself a slight amount of extra room, but when actively moving this is negligible.   The research does NOT show that this advice is useful. AT ALL. Causal factors are still being studied and whether or not surgery actually helps with arthritis later on in life is still up in the air. This is just one dude's opinion. You can try all you want to prevent bone spurs in your hip - good luck."
weightlifting,3duq87,chaobro,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:15:29 2015 UTC,"Currently dealing with a similar injury right now. I was diagnosed with Hip Dysplasia, a shallow hip socket, which caused severe Anterior Pelvic Tilt and Internal Snapping Hip Syndrome. Secondary low back/SI pain and the hip impingement of my hip flexors has limited my training for the last week. Doctors recommended limiting weightlifting while going through my physical therapy, which is 6 weeks starting tomorrow. Its difficult mentally not being able to move well and lift weights, but the pain has limited my everyday activities/comfort so Im taking it seriously.   You should think about your training with long term goals. I know that I will lose strength, speed, technique etc, but those things will be re-obtainable when you are healthy. Plus, once your hip/pelvis is strong and healthy, you may be able to move better and lift more weights in the future."
weightlifting,3duq87,Majuca8,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:14:57 2015 UTC,"I've dealt with FAI with in my right hip for the last couple of years. I started feeling pain one day in my squats and it progressed until I wasn't really able to lift. I saw a doctor and got the diagnosis and did physical therapy for about a month. There really isn't much they can do outside of strengthening the hip and surgery is definitely lurking in the background.  But I was lucky in that my labrum was still intact. So I just made changes to how I lift to avoid doing much additional damage. I started doing a lot more mobility and hip strengthening exercises. And what really helped was to add some additional heel height to my shoes. I added .75"" heel lift to my romaelos. That helped to push the load on my ankles and away from my hip.  But if you have a torn labrum it is really best to look at surgery. It's not something that is going to heal and it will get progressively worse as you get older. You don't want to be facing hip replacement in 40's because you neglected a nagging injury."
weightlifting,3duq87,dogerobber,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:59:55 2015 UTC,"Definitely have FAI, in both ( left is worse). Don't know if the labrum is torn or not, but Dr thinks that it's definitely damaged. So follow up question...Did the physical therapy help and return you to 100%?"
weightlifting,3duq87,dogerobber,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:50:40 2015 UTC,"I would say 95%. It hurts if I stress it to much and I have to spend a lot of time stretching and keeping it healthy. But I squat about 50lbs more than I did when I first injured it, so I can say it really hasn't affected me to much."
weightlifting,3duq87,chaobro,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:31:23 2015 UTC,"If you have a torn labrum, physical therapy is going to help you strengthen your gluteus, adductors, etc. that might help you with pain. However, you probably will always have a torn labrum. It doesn't get much blood flow - though that isn't to say it's a lost cause.   I have FAI in both hips, cam impingement only based on my x-rays. Had a great surgeon and had a good recovery, though it was sort of arduous. I care much more about weight control and timing during my lifts now. I don't go rock bottom as often. I train powers more often and deadlift more - it's all about longevity."
weightlifting,3du1l5,WrathOfAiur,3,Sun Jul 19 13:43:45 2015 UTC,"Your timing is off. That's why the bar is crashing onto you. You need to get more rythm in your lifts. At a light weight do a bunch of reps just trying to get a good rythm. Don't think about anything else too much just pull, extend, under the bar. Once you're in a rythm go for awhile. Don't think too much, just lift. Look up too, that'll help with timing."

weightlifting,3du1l5,mattwilliams06,0,Sun Jul 19 19:11:31 2015 UTC,yeah thats definitely hard to develop if you're lifting by yourself. the more intensity the better.  good job self teaching though
weightlifting,3du1l5,RugbyDork,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:56:39 2015 UTC,"I think the first one looked the best. second and third I think I didn't extend all the way before I pulled. I am a complete newbie, so I have no clue if this is correct.  I also have trouble with hook gripping. is the bar supposed to be more towards the fingers like when deadlifting? I only get a good grip if it sits in the palm of my hand but that way I am pretty sure my calluses will tear sooner or later."
weightlifting,3du1l5,benj0y,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:47:45 2015 UTC,"If you point your hand towards the floor, the bar should rest just below your callouses on the first ""line"" of your finger (wow that was surprisingly difficult to explain), that way you won't pinch your callouses and rip them off. Also as far as callouses goes, if they get too big they will come off anyway, so use a pumice stone to file them down and don't use moisturizer as it will make them soft and prone to damage.  Holding the bar low down in the hand might feel less tight; particularly with hookgrip, but it shouldn't go anywhere. Also I wouldn't hold past the section of your thumb with your thumbnail on it. If you grab further up your finger you can quite easily dislocate it."
weightlifting,3du1l5,bulldog73,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:26:36 2015 UTC,"the problem is that I don't really get a good grip on my thumb at all if it's not in my palm. I am starting to think that the barbell might just be too thick. It's just a standard bar in a commercial gym, no weightlifting bar. I have no idea how thick it is, but maybe that's the problem. But thank you for clarifying it. that's exactly where I would grab the bar for all other pulling exercises."

weightlifting,3dt2wv,mouseahouse,7,Sun Jul 19 04:42:06 2015 UTC,"As someone who competed in both sports I can say this. In Wilhelm's time the sport of Strongman was more of a niche that had a certain purity; no one really ""knew"" the proper form to lift an atlas stone or carry a yoke. It was simple, they took athletes from weightlifting, wrestling, football, etc... and Wilhelm won, hands down. After Wilhelm, it was Kaz, arguably the strongest human to ever walk the planet.  Once strongman was established as its own sport, there gave an ""in"" to people that could master the events without having that essence of all around strength. And if you strip that out, IMO, the weightlifter wins.   I got into weightlifting because my favorite strongmen 10 years ago, were former weightlifters. Raimonds Bergmanis, Misha Koklaev, even Jesse Marunde. It's the main reason why I consider myself a weightlifter today after only 3 meets as a weightlifter and at least 2 dozen competitions as a strongman.   Not to mention the injuries in weightlifting are mostly overuse injuries that heal pretty quickly. I have 2 surgeries and a half-dozen injuries that put me out of commission for months when I did strongman. I've had one injury in weightlifting that took about 6 weeks of physical therapy to correct."

For me, that is what made this original contest really interesting. I've always watched the WSM when they've shown them compete on ESPN for little 30minute segments running all day, until now when this channel airs as much of the program as possible.   As much as I like seeing some classics like the stones or the toss or even log press become a mainstay as events, the more ""random order"" of the start of WSM kind of intrigues me too. I mean, they were throwing a tire for distance and I kinda think the average person will ""get it"" more than current events. I believe everyone understands how heavy a bus feels to try and pull, but the original events being so odd-ball kind of added to the intrigue in my opinion. There was less to practice for and you either were prepared or not from your training.  Misha has also been an inspiration to me, even with me never picking up strongman. Being a powerhouse and competitive at PL, WL & WSM is pretty impressive in my opinion. Not sure how his numbers stack up across the boards, but if anyone deserves a title of strength athlete, he certainly takes it."

I've had one injury in weightlifting that took about 6 weeks of physical therapy to correct.   One of the things that makes Weightlifting safer than other strength disciplines is that the weights typically increase in a slow and progressive manner, the apparatus allows the weight to be kept close to the body, and the exercises follow repetitive movement patterns. So the body has an opportunity to adapt to the new movements and loads placed on it.  The irregular lifts and loads that Strongman athletes have to contend with are fun to watch but carry a much higher probability of injury - even for trained and experienced athletes."

Hearing ""Olympic-style powerlifting"" I died inside a little but was immediately resuscitated when they started by floor pressing 200kg+ logs  without any grip modifications to the logs, they had to chalk their hands and balance the darn thing on the palms of their hands."
