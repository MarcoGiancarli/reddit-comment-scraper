Everyone who works there seems to have an awesome amount of talent and dedication for what they do. I love you for actually not listening to everyone wanting an Underground 3 and instead doing it in a way that makes the most sense and it's everything I wanted out of a Need for Speed game. Thank you for everything you guys did, this game is a big part of my memories and seeing it done justice by people who care just as much if not more makes me the happiest dude! Finally, Need for Speed is back to take its rightful crown."

Maybe we could bring together all the antagonists from past games (Eddy from Underground, Caleb from Underground 2, Razor from Most Wanted 2005, Darius from Carbon, etc.)?"

needforspeed,3e37ui,Allegiance10,5,Tue Jul 21 17:22:44 2015 UTC,I cannot wait for this game. Saving my 50% off store credit for this.
needforspeed,3e37ui,markwollenweber,3,Tue Jul 21 17:59:30 2015 UTC,I thought they confirmed the game was 100% at night?
needforspeed,3e37ui,Deadzone_,6,Tue Jul 21 17:39:03 2015 UTC,That's dawn and dusk shots which the game takes place in. That means morning until evening and it just cycles through that. That image represents the devs trying to get as close as possible to a real life reference photos as possible and it looks like they nailed it. There is no daytime but there are mornings and you can see HERE another screenshot from in-game at dawn.   TL;DR - Only 50% at night and 50% during morning but no daytime. Game goes straight from dawn to dusk and evening and back to dawn and so on.
needforspeed,3e37ui,mustardheadmaster,3,Tue Jul 21 17:46:18 2015 UTC,"Fuck, I can't wait to play a race at dawn."

When they said it would make you question whether or not it was real, I was skeptical like everyone else. Now, my jaw is gone. Yea, just let that sink in, on the left side you'll see stuff that was rendered in-engine while on the right are the reference photos from real life. This is insane."

needforspeed,3e37ui,houbsurf,5,Tue Jul 21 19:39:36 2015 UTC,"This looks like it's more of an in engine render than in game. With that being said, the game will look like this.

needforspeed,3e1fhq,Nightmaarez,2,Tue Jul 21 13:52:54 2015 UTC,"I wish they went back to good storylines for racing games. That is probably why the old NFS games are so heralded is because they had a good story, so people were more invested in the characters, why they were racing, and the cars that they owned. Even if you say you didn't pay attention to it, it still probably helped add to the immersion. With the new games its like ""race this car, catch this dude, and run from the cops"" with no explanation why (only current NFS game I have played was Hot Pursuit 2010 so correct me if I am wrong)."

needforspeed,3e1fhq,Nightmaarez,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:23:52 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I also only played HP2010 of the recent ones. Honestly, I think some companies decide to just focus on the game and end up forgetting simple things such as a good plot. Agree with what you said, the plots give you motivation to play more and more to see what happens in the end. Underground 1 didn't have much, but then when you directly played 2 and found out all you worked for has been destroyed, you get literally mad at the guy who did it, therefore setting up a GREAT example of proper motivation to the player.  The Crew had a quite meh plot, but at least it had one unlike the recent NFS games. Glad to know this one at least has more than Rivals seemed to try."

Also, ps3 and xbox version are theoritechly ''new'' and they also added new gamemodes and stuff like a year ago, so that kinda makes me know that the servers on pc are still on.

Second, I would say that it will be a phase of teens again. The good news is that most teens will want to stay in their homes because of money and time constraints. If anything only the most passionate will go out and start looking for info online. Plus there's so much more help and community now thanks to the internet than there was back in 2004. I would say it will introduce many, let a few overzealous teens in, but mainly expose many younger people to this kind of culture.  I'd like to call up Mirror's Edge and its affect on the parkour community. Sure there were some people who just wanted to go in without care but a ton of kids got into freerunning. There were a few injuries I won't lie but look at how the sport can be recognized everywhere now. Back in 2005 you probably would get a few weird looks if you mentioned ""parkour"" in a conversation."

But I'm hoping and praying for a proper good game, without money-scamming bullshit from EA and P2W. If that's not too much to ask for these days."
needforspeed,3deby9,kezorN,2,Wed Jul 15 23:06:19 2015 UTC,"Yep, you said it. Optimization is key. I'm somewhat accepting of Rivals being optimized not so well as Ghost had to work with an engine completely new to them (that is my understanding, please feel free to correct this if wrong); while DICE on the other hand knows it inside out (as they made it lol). Hopefully with the extra time spent on it, and the apparently very talented team at Ghost (and I don't doubt that given the videos/screenshots) it will turn out wonderful."
needforspeed,3deby9,Kirasath,-2,Thu Jul 16 09:11:07 2015 UTC,If it runs 60+ fps on ultra with the same looks as the E3 demo it doesn't have poor optimization/porting

Originally I thought it actually WAS the RWB S15, but from what I can see, the one in the trailer has an RB in it, while the ""real"" matte black RWB S15 had an SR last I knew.   Edit:  After doing a bit of internet sleuthing, its kinda hard to say whether or not it's the actual rwb s15.  They're both RHD, different wheels but that's easy to change, different engines...and I haven't found any recent articles on the car so I can't say for certain what color it is now but it was black last I knew.  The RWB S15 is done by Nakai-San who they're talking about in the video so...who knows maybe it is the real rwb s15.  My best guess is that it's just someone who built a very similar car though."

If they can't, then the strength-speed tradeoff inherent in driving an SUV or truck is absolutely useless."

I think it's sad to see such a realistic beautifully looking game be ruined by too easy gameplay handling which belongs to mobile games. I want to be able to drift my car my way, do a U turn when I want to... Do a small burnout drift, and then get it out of that spinning burnout into a long drift. Criterion's handling makes it limited, you can't do all these things. You have to be going fast, to slide corners without even countersteering. It's SAD, to see such a beautiful game with so much potential. Deep customization, be ruined by weird gameplay. Most Wanted 2005 had the perfect drifting as well.   -Check here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PRQE52pR1w  -Check this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv7ItxX6_vs  This or Forza Horizon 2 handling is all I wanted. If a 2005 Need For Speed game could've done it, why can't a 2015 Need For Speed game do it?"
needforspeed,3cym5s,Iceman_Nightmare,2,Sun Jul 12 03:15:20 2015 UTC,"I honesty could not agree more. The new game looks so promising but if it handles like a port of a mobile game then the exercise will be of utter futility. For this reason I will not be buying the game straightaway on launch.   Most Wanted had a fantastic handling and drifting model. Using carefully timed handbrakes for initiations and having to use a combination of extra gas, handbrake, and engine breaking to change directions was the perfect combination of being not only realistic, but being fun and challenging too."
needforspeed,3cym5s,StxrStruck,2,Sun Jul 12 14:31:29 2015 UTC,I think I speak for a majority of the community when I say I am extremely scared they will somehow (accidently) fuck this up.

Not downgraded. Frostbite engine is incredible. They tried a grip setup car and that drifting was a little difficult. Said he had to use the handbrake alot. At the start, they had doubts about the Reputation point system but then quickly got caught up in trying the different ways of earning said points whether it was by drifting around corners, destruction of certain objects in the streets, provoking police cars etc. (5 pillars of the game,so there's different ways to earn rep points)"

needforspeed,3cvh0w,ThaneDukeHeineken,1 point,Sat Jul 11 02:55:17 2015 UTC,"Dirt has gymkhana in it If I'm correct, and it's using a 4WD car to go sideways. The Japanese doesn't consider this drifting, since with a 4WD car you are not fully out of control like you are with a rear wheel drive only car (For example: 180sx, S13, S14, S15, 350z, etc).  So this game is not an offroad/gymkhana game. That's why I rather have you compare the handling to maybe GRID (Same developers who made DIRT) which does have drifting in it.   I personally loved the drifting in the first GRID, and I think Forza Horizon 2 has one of the best arcade drifting I have seen out there so far. Asphalt is and recent Need For SPeeds is too easy and simple in my opinion. This is what I want in the new NFS 2015. I hate grip, but If criterion drifting is the only option, i much rather go with grip  There for if they can make it like Forza Horizon 2, or any GranTurismo 5's car that has been tuned correctly to drift. I would be happy. Please notice if you tune a car correctly to drift in GT5 its very easy on Tsukuba Circuit."

needforspeed,3ckigr,ConverseFox,3,Thu Jul 9 01:58:06 2015 UTC,"You know, automatic transmission in any game is just a manual transmission controlled by a simple algorithm (if the RPM is value then switch gear to new gear). And setting up the transmission-emulating algorithm (which is manually controlled at first) is the first thing devs do if they want to emulate car's gearbox and it's sounds. So no insane programming is needed to implement the MT. It's just their descision to replace human controlled transmission with an algorithm."
needforspeed,3ckigr,Dk_krypton,2,Thu Jul 9 14:55:39 2015 UTC,Can somebody direct me to where they confirmed no manual transmission?
needforspeed,3ckigr,SnuggieX,3,Wed Jul 8 18:58:49 2015 UTC,They haven't confirmed it. Just some youtubers who've played the early version saying it wasn't there. That was even before the pre-alpha.

needforspeed,3ckigr,Stvn_P-J,2,Thu Jul 9 22:00:13 2015 UTC,It's not complaining it's called voicing your opinion for the sake of the game! Why is it such a big deal to request a manual transmition in a car game ? It's not a matter of being a simulation or arcade racer because that doesn't even make sense... Arcade machines have the option to use manual but nobody's forcing you to use it. It just adds depth to the players who would benefit from it. It's more like car control basics. The drift culture wouldn't exist as we know it without manual gearboxes.  In a game that is catering to such 'tuner' culture it's not a massive ask to requet. I get it that people who want to use automatic don't care but why go on about how it's not necessary?  Everyone one of my friends that are into cars prefer manual and I know for a fact we are not an exception to the demographic.

If adding it means that the quality of other parts of the game are compromised, then skip it. Otherwise, we would like to have that option."

I have posted comments where I state my opinion on whether or not I think certain things should be included, but I don't think it's fair to do all this complaining and start petitions. The team(s) creating this game are working their asses off trying to make it a good experience for everyone while you sit around and whine that you can't get the one tiny thing you want.

needforspeed,3ckigr,RoshiFluttershy,3,Thu Jul 9 23:36:33 2015 UTC,"I know NFS is arcade game, but if we go back to the Underground 1 - 2, there was manual transmission option."
needforspeed,3ckigr,flipperkip97,-1,Thu Jul 9 23:52:15 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but that isn't grounds for a petition to the development team because a few redditors want a mechanic instilled in the game. I believe in the comment section of another thread it was explained how they do manual transmission, and that all they would have to do is recode the game so that you control shifting times instead of the computer, since it already is technically manual transmission (the game is just shifting for you). I just find it pretty immature that people are reacting this way. As i said before, if it's that big of a deal go play something else. These guys are going out of their way to perfect this game to the point where it will be atleast enjoyable for the greater good, rather than making it a game focused on maybe 1/4th of their fan base (the die-hards who want manual transmission), and while still not focusing it entirely on the other 3/4ths of their fanbase (casuals who just want a cool game, easy access, etc., etc.)"

needforspeed,3ch1ul,firecloud7,6,Tue Jul 7 21:13:57 2015 UTC,"The speed at which they're releasing information is killing me to the point where it's killing my hype.  It's been nearly a month since the E3 reveal and this is basically the first new content they've released to us since - and it's all just information anyone paying attention worked out a long while ago.  For a game releasing in November, you would think they'd be able gradually release more info - for instance - if you reveal a new car every second day, that would take months in itself.  I know I know, Gamescon, but that's still a while away, and presumably the new trailer won't come out too far before then. Feed us a bone Ben!"
needforspeed,3ch1ul,houbsurf,1 point,Wed Jul 8 00:25:02 2015 UTC,This so accurately describes my feelings about this game atm.
needforspeed,3ch1ul,shibewowdoge,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:34:08 2015 UTC,"The fact that you post here in this sub kinda makes your statement of killing the hype for you quite the contrary. They got a huge hype from E3 and then only shared a breadcrumb here and there where people crave more and more... I'd say they're maintaining the hype very well.  Gamescom is also just a month away, it's pretty safe to say they're gonna be revealing more about the game then. It's still FOUR months away from release, so it would kill the hype if they released a lot of info already at this stage imo."
needforspeed,3ch1ul,trickeh2k,2,Wed Jul 8 16:01:27 2015 UTC,"I post here, sure, but it's all relative. I'm not as excited as I was because they've left us hanging; no one's on the 'E3 buzz' anymore. With the direction they've gone in, they were always going to get big hype, but I think they've failed to sustain it because they haven't ridden the wave of popularity. That's not to say people won't jump back on board when they release new details but it's been a really slow grind for any tidbits.  They've confirmed they'll show more at Gamescon, but as I said, that will have been a 2 month departure from E3.  4 month's isn't heaps of time, and as I said, there's so much info to cover. As I said, if every day or two they showed us a little bit of information, for instance confirming a new car with a simple screenshot, or showing a particular customization element, could easily be stretched out to that 4 month time frame.  I just think that easing this information out is a better way to maintain our excitement as fans than just releasing the full car list at a point later down the line.   I think everyone following the twitter, for instance, is sick and tired of seeing the same 5 or so screenshots re-posted over and over and the generic ""watch this space"" PR lines."

It would be the most stupid thing ever to have system specs tuned for 4K. 4K is still at least two years from becoming the next thing, right now people are moving on to 144Hz @ 1440p and that's just for the very small segment of high-end pc rigs."

GTA 5 isn't even that heavy , 4 Titan X should be able to play it on 4K easily . something bottlenecked him , or used them crazy Anti Aliasing settings which meant that the AA just doubled the resolution at 2x TXAA or quadrupled the resolution at 4x TXAA , that's how AA works"

I mean, it's pointless to use someone like BlackPanthaa for more or less anything racing related.  It's like being a journalist and review a music genre you're not enjoying. Even if you're a good writer the review will come out odd most likely and fans of the genre and/or artist/group will probably scratch their heads and wonder what he was on about.  Yeah, that's usually a good idea. Problem today is that 90% of the reviews are console and most of them doesn't even mention that. If it's a PC review, many of them doesn't even comment on the FPS or performance which is quite weak and sad.  At least with TB we know that we get a proper report from someone that's a fan of PC gaming and understand it :)"

needforspeed,3c9wqn,flipperkip97,3,Mon Jul 6 12:00:32 2015 UTC,"Completely agree with all the xbox one comments due to Forza, and more specifically Forza Horizon 2. I fucking love that game.  I usually game on PC, but after having played Forza Horizon (1) on 360, Forza Horizon 2 really got me buying an xbox one.   Horizon 2 is everything I want NFS 2015 to be. Maybe a bit more appearance-styling/customization in NFS, but other than that I think Horizon is perfect. Huge open world, incredible graphics, tons of detailed cars that can all be customized, driving and drifting that is not too hard, but still takes practise/skill to master. And the car sounds hnnnggg.  NFS 2015 can learn a lot from Horizon 2."

They are cheap and widely available. You can also buy a plug and play kit, which is kind of over priced. The PS4 is a better console for other games, but racing game that would be a no for now."

I'm sorry, but Xbox fans should be ashamed of themselves for even looking at those consoles after all that shit that Microsoft tried to pull on their fans. I'm not saying that as a PS4 fan, I'm saying that as a human being. I felt bad for Xbox fans when Microsoft announced the X-Bone. Shameful.

needforspeed,3c89vn,REIKU_,1 point,Mon Jul 6 04:26:37 2015 UTC,"Fair point. About drags tho, imo, drag racing is pointless. There is no skill involved. Obviously you have to maintain control through high acceleration and speeds, but outside of that, all that is determined is which car is faster/who shifts tighter. Without manual transmission, they are truly taking all skill involved out of drag racing. Even irl most drag racers use tuned automatics, thus the only winner is he who tuned his transmission properly. Not to say that drag racing isn't fun/entertaining, it just requires little to no skill, which is why i hate drag racers who think they're all that. All they do is push the ignition, line it up on the track, push throttle, and make sure they don't go off course."

In NFSW I loved the car meets where people gather around showing their car designs and have some cruises together. And I also really enjoy uploading pics of my cars for other people to comment or to enter a vinyl desing contests (like there was in nfsunlimited.net).   All I'm saying is that vinyls don't automaticly mean over-the-top tribal/flame desings but that vinyls can be used to make something unique and something that really fits the style of the car itself. Neons are a no for me too, time has passed for such things and I personally don't understand why they've made the sound system possibility (a bit pointless IMO)"

NFS promos his videos on twitter as well so they're pretty legit. However things are subject to change, cuz again he played a really early version."
needforspeed,3c85uw,Dk_krypton,5,Sun Jul 5 21:17:10 2015 UTC,"He's the perfect guy for NFS, The Crew etc. Never ever talks negatively on any game and often knows jack shit on how the game mechanics works etc.  He got attention during his The Crew beta stages and rose from there, quickly gave up anything related to quality and started mass producing to get more views and be sure not to get in a bad state with the devs.  He's been invited like TriniPsycho said though to Ghost in Gothenburg to play the game and give his feedback on what they wanted to see. That was in February I believe and Ben said that they're planning to re-invite people again so it's a safe bet he'll get invited once more.  Thing is, doesn't matter that much because everything he learns that's not already public is under NDA so anything he tells us are already out there."

needforspeed,3c85uw,Alexey_70707,3,Sun Jul 5 20:54:37 2015 UTC,"This is him not stating any good fact as usual, just sucking up to the devs. It's not like manual is a hard thing to implement, the only reason I could see it not being in the game if it's too tricky to make it work with the current game without giving a advantage or disadvantage from it.  For the most part, I think people mainly want it because of the drift spec. In drifting, manual gears is a must if you want to excel and become a good drifter."

There have been several arcade racing games that have utilized a manual transmission before. Yes, I'm sure it's going to be a ""high octane racer,"" but there's no harm in having a MT for those who want a challenge and don't want to just hold the gas pedal down all the time.

needforspeed,3bydzv,EpicallyBoss,1 point,Fri Jul 3 21:34:18 2015 UTC,Yeah but having just a few selected people over in February isn't even near anything like a beta/alpha test. I really liked what you did there and probably gave good input on how you best should approach future development of the game.  I'm also assuming that a lot has happened with the game since and will be over the time. Are you planning to re-invite them or any other new people?
needforspeed,3bydzv,trickeh2k,9,Fri Jul 3 10:28:31 2015 UTC,Are you planning to re-invite them or any other new people?  Yes.
needforspeed,3bydzv,Ghost_Ben,1 point,Fri Jul 3 12:18:30 2015 UTC,"How about an open beta maybe? Other EA games also had open betas so that might be a good way to get as much feedback as possible and also give everyone a chance to try the game. Hell, even The Crew also had a beta but closed betas are super finicky and usually you have to bribe your way in and some people even sell access to the closed beta. But please, I will literally buy the Deluxe Edition if the game isn't always online. I don't want this to fail like Sim City did with the always online fiasco. Maxis is now defunct because of that. They lost so many players due to the always online DRM on SimCity. So please, I BEG YOU, don't make this game always online."
needforspeed,3bydzv,Malvu5,1 point,Fri Jul 3 14:15:17 2015 UTC,"SimCity wasn't a good game and certainly not the kind of what fans wanted or expected. Online only and bad servers of course hurt the sales but after the server issues were remedied not many people I know played it that much.  I think I gave it about 20-30hrs tops before I left the game to collect dust in the library.  ONT: I'd love to see an beta, closed or open doesn't matter to me but still... I think it shows that they're dedicated to get it working and also what problems to expect server wise. People generally are quite quick to find out how to exploit the game or show any imbalance quite quickly."

needforspeed,3c1saz,einjzmolf,3,Sat Jul 4 00:33:44 2015 UTC,Grip probably has drifting like in the older games.
needforspeed,3c1saz,ConverseFox,4,Fri Jul 3 23:40:58 2015 UTC,You can't expect Grip to completely prevent the vehicle from loosing traction. That would be silly.
needforspeed,3c1saz,ConverseFox,1 point,Sat Jul 4 00:33:53 2015 UTC,Not sure if trolling or just that dumb...
needforspeed,3c1saz,flipperkip97,2,Sat Jul 4 02:55:33 2015 UTC,"I could be way off but from looking at both screenshots here and here, the ''Drift-Grip'' slider seems to act as an indicator of your final handling, as the slider stays on screen even if you scroll down the menu. Basically any adjustments in the advanced sliders below would move the ''Drift-Grip'' slider to give you an idea where you're handling is at.  For example, increasing rear tire pressure and loosening the steering (which would normally mean less grip and more oversteer) would move the slider towards Drift."
needforspeed,3c1saz,G0bias,2,Sat Jul 4 05:34:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah, no confirmation of anything here.   It seems pretty obvious to me... there is one spectrum of 'driving setup', one end 'drift', one end 'grip'. Going all the way to 'drift' will give you the 'Criterion' drifting model, and moving the slider more to the right will minimalize the severity of the drifting.  That doesn't mean that there's a different drifting model that you're able to select like the questioner was hoping for."
needforspeed,3c1saz,houbsurf,1 point,Sun Jul 5 01:39:46 2015 UTC,What about the auto brake on or off feature. Isnt that in otherwords turn off Criterion's game drift model off or on?
needforspeed,3c1saz,houbsurf,1 point,Sat Jul 4 01:58:48 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, forgot about that bit. We'll have to watch this space and see what effect that has on the handling..."
needforspeed,3c1saz,flipperkip97,1 point,Sat Jul 4 04:13:25 2015 UTC,"Yes, it is. Brake drift on is Criterion style drifting (with one short press on the brake) but if you turn it off, it's like older NFS games, where you will probably not drift through every corner."
needforspeed,3bys98,blafc,2,Fri Jul 3 06:48:20 2015 UTC,I think Golf GTI will be in game because in No Limits is and in that mobile game are same cars like in trailers for NFS- that Porsche 911 RWB and Subaru BRZ....yeah and the next thing- i hope DLCs will be like free updates (like in GTA V or GranTurismo6 ) what you guys think?

needforspeed,3bw9z2,harryvan,1 point,Fri Jul 3 12:02:33 2015 UTC,"It's either Rivals or The Crew. It can't be neither. You can play Rivals offline and The Crew is always online. The Crew literally is unplayable without a connection to the developer servers. At least Rivals is actually playable offline but it also keeps the online component. Literally, Rivals is the best way they could do it. If it's always online it will just be Sim City levels of disaster and might finally kill the NFS series like the Sims series as well. After Sim City also being always online and Sims 4 being a step backwards from Sims 3, EA shut down Maxis. Trust me, if this is always online it will just flop. I have The Crew and it sucks in almost every way."

And still it is.   I, personally, agree that such a strategy of putting this DRM in every single game is a terrible idea. Maybe Rivals is the best way of doing such things, I don't really know.  All I know (all we know) now is that there's gonna be a singleplayer and multiplayer (both mixed and divided) in new NFS. And the game is always-online.  I belive that EA shuts down studios because they think that these studios are guilty of making a bad game, while definately EA is the one to blame for forcing everyone to make always-online games.  EDIT: There has been a discussion about this since the announcment of the game... So this topic is a bit outdated.  But, anyway, here's a petition against always-online in a new NFS... Don't know if it'll make any difference tho."
needforspeed,3bw9z2,harryvan,1 point,Fri Jul 3 13:32:22 2015 UTC,"I'm just hoping the devs actually read this and take some cues from it. They seem to be avoiding the question for some reason and they even deleted the previous claims that it was online only. Perhaps they're trying to actually make it work offline... imagine if Mirror's Edge Catalyst will be always online as well and that game is pure single player. Same thing for Battlefront, even though it has single player missions as well. It's just stupid... Imagine how hard Dragon Age Inquisition would have flopped if it was always online as well. I mean, it's insanely stupid and this game will make or break the NFS series. At least Rivals is playable offline. Don't see any valid reason as to why this should require a constant connection."

needforspeed,3bx1f7,alwayscalibrating,3,Fri Jul 3 01:43:12 2015 UTC,There's no real way to know since most of the Need for Speed games didn't connect to the internet automatically. It would definitely be an interesting statistic to see though.  But I can tell you that I've been playing Underground 2 recently and Hot Pursuit 2 this evening. I could play this game all day...
needforspeed,3bx1f7,ConverseFox,3,Fri Jul 3 02:40:27 2015 UTC,"The Undergrounds were the best.  Still, I love Carbon myself."
needforspeed,3bwjwg,RobbbarN,8,Thu Jul 2 19:07:08 2015 UTC,"I just bought a physical copy of it 4 days ago on PC. I just caught a 8.5$ offer and I said why not. And I honestly gotta say that I really don't understand all the hate.  I freakin' love this game! For me it's just pure fun, I feel like a 10 year old kid left alone in an amusement park. But I don't really know why, it's just a refurnished version of Hot Pursuit (2010), and even though I liked that one too, Rivals just seems miles better than that one. Even when the map is full of dicks who are only after your SP (btw, if you're seeing this, fuck you A_Lost_Hope, whoever you are!), it simply is just mindless fun.  Downsides? There is no fullscreen support for some graphic cards, I play it on a maximized window, and it's quite distracting, but I try to get used to it. Quite a lot of crashes (two, on seven hours of gameplay), but it's understandable for an eight month development window. But the most annoying part is the host migration cut off. It just disconnects you instantly, and when it reconnects, it has an approximate 5-10 second period of blackscreen with running gameplay. So if the game cuts me off while on a pursuit, I immediately get busted after I'm getting reconnected, so it's a huge pain in the ass. It's a shame that the support has been cut off, some extra polishing would've made this game so much better.  But on a final note, I'm really glad that I bought it. I'm actually pretty sad that I didn't do it earlier. Have fun with the game!  P.S. I wouldn't mind some Origin friends so if you're interested, I'm L3MON_AID."
needforspeed,3bwjwg,l3mon_aid,2,Thu Jul 2 21:48:28 2015 UTC,"I completely agree with you. You described Rivals perfectly ... awesome fun when it's working. If I really wanted to nit-pick on Rivals, I could find a lot to complain about, but there's enough fun packed away in the game that I can turn a blind eye on most of it. It's fun to play, and that's all that really matters."
needforspeed,3bwjwg,Stvn_P-J,2,Fri Jul 3 02:08:34 2015 UTC,"You just described some pretty game breaking bugs and yet you start out with that you don't understand the hate? Here's my pro's and cons with the game  Pro's + Good selection of cars + Interesting enviroment + Interesting DLC cars  Con's - Piss poor port making the game unstable and you had to use different kind of command lines to start the game and unlock the framerate and downsample the game (until drivers gave that feature). - P2P as a network model effectively broke the game as parts of the map would stop streaming and you'd be stuck mid-air and had to force quit the game because some moron with dial-up form Russia had been selected as the host. -No lobby system for multiplayer races making them more or less non-existent. - Game was left very early and given very few patches to address issues with the game. - Cheesiest ""story"" ever in an NFS title, I had to skip the cutscenes because they made me feel so uncomfortable."
needforspeed,3bwjwg,trickeh2k,1 point,Fri Jul 3 11:34:36 2015 UTC,"Most of those problems occurred because, as I said, the development window was extremely short for such an ambitious project. Don't get me wrong, that's not a relevant excuse, they could've solved them in a few after-release packages, but my guess is that the support was dropped afterwards because of the low number of sold copies. And I really couldn't care less about those problems, it's not like it's totally unplayable. If you have some important stuff to do alone, just switch to single player and more than half of the problems are solved.  About the story, I somehow agree, there were some cringe worthy scenes, but there are like 6-7 of them, no longer than 1-2 minutes. So it's not a huge deal breaker for me.  These games take so much shit from NFS fans because they don't use the same recipe used in older famous NFS titles. They never see the glass half full, the same thing happened with this year's NFS.   ""Ground braking graphics with flawless transition from real-life to in-game? WIDE variety of customization options? Huge open-world gameplay? Classic cars? Fuck that shit, I wanna brag about that horrible but modifiable handling and lack of manual transmission in a pre-alpha footage, won't buy!""  Many of you forgot about the fact that games, and especially racing games(which if made properly, can pump your adrenaline through the roof) are supposed to be fun. And I consider Rivals to be really fun, and not even those 1-2 major problems aren't enough to ruin it.   I'll tell you what, if Rivals would've been released under a different brand, it could've gotten so much more praise from an even wider audience."
needforspeed,3bwjwg,l3mon_aid,1 point,Fri Jul 3 13:14:15 2015 UTC,"I hardly see 8 months as the total development cycle, maybe from Ghost's side but Criterion had already begun developing the game before they handed it over to Ghost.  Ghost also started working on the next NFS title before Rivals even was launched, so it kinda shows they knew it would take too much time and resources to fix the game and just went on with the next one.  Depends on what kind of player you are I guess. For me, I just always complete the single player aspect of the game first before heading into multiplayer (yes, I must do this in every game...). Problem is, there is none in this game which is why people most likely play this game for a very short period of time. So yeah, it's unplayable for me because there's nothing to come back to but a broken P2P model that forces you to quit and restart the game over and over again because the would suddenly would stop streaming.  Unless you have a bunch of friends to race with, there's nothing to do in Rivals. Rivals never gave me any adrenaline rush since I get that from competitive racing against others online.  Yeah, you're probably right about Rivals getting more negativity because it's under the NFS franchise. Still doesn't justify what a horrible state the game was shipped in and how little care it got from any development team after release."
needforspeed,3bwjwg,trickeh2k,1 point,Fri Jul 3 13:58:30 2015 UTC,"The part with the development time, well that's what I heard some time ago from a certain youtuber, if I understood wrong, then my bad.  I don't know on which platform you're playing, but on PC I've never been put in a game with less than 3-4 players. I was left alone once, because the others left, but most of the times there's always someone to play with.  And a good answer for your last point would be simple: EA. I doubt that Ghost is in total control of the development scheduling as it is in the actual process of development, but that's just my guess considering the dedication and effort put in this year's game."
needforspeed,3bwjwg,l3mon_aid,1 point,Fri Jul 3 15:46:48 2015 UTC,"Could be that it refers to Ghost development cycle and not the full one but I'll leave that for speculation.  I was playing on PC and it's not the number of other players that ever has been the issue. It's racing against the other players not hunting down randoms and destroy them with weapons.  Yeah, of course. A publisher dictates most of the rules and then the dev team does it's best effort by time frames, budget etc."
needforspeed,3bwjwg,trickeh2k,1 point,Fri Jul 3 16:29:18 2015 UTC,"Sorry, I misread ""none"" as ""no one"", my bad. You're right, it's hard to find someone which you can enjoy a nice race with. Almost impossible.  And even if you could, the map sync is way off, until now I couldn't bump into a single player without seeing him scattered all over the road because of the lag. I don't know if it's my fault, the host's fault or the server's fault, but it's a real bummer."

needforspeed,3bvx4l,xKronicL,5,Fri Jul 3 06:25:56 2015 UTC,"Horizon 2 physics are perfect for a NFS game. Not too realistic, not too easy."
needforspeed,3bvx4l,flipperkip97,2,Thu Jul 2 17:04:59 2015 UTC,"I've been wondering. Ghost has mentioned that we'd get to choose between drift and grip. What if the grip handling allows us to drift the way we want it to? I mean, they aren't going to goof up that bad. Ghost knows that the reason people hate the newer NFSs is because of how ridiculous the handling was.   Also, every other post on this sub goes back to the same damn things. Let's all just chill a little and let /u/Ghost_Ben give us a heads up when they are ready to let us know."
needforspeed,3bvx4l,Dk_krypton,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:07:27 2015 UTC,"The Grip/Drift thing is a single slider, so you can choose how much Drift or Grip you want."
needforspeed,3bvx4l,ConverseFox,2,Fri Jul 3 00:56:42 2015 UTC,"I know that. What I meant is, what if the drifting mode changes as well? What if it lets you drift manually like in UG2 if you set it to grip?"
needforspeed,3bvx4l,Dk_krypton,2,Fri Jul 3 01:08:48 2015 UTC,"The way I look at it is like this: full on 'Grip' can't prevent you from loosing traction(that would be crazy dumb), but it supposedly has no 'Drift'. Therefore, it can be deduced that it has manual drifting.  Note that this is all assumption, but it'd be cool if /u/Ghost_Ben could confirm this.. Unfortunately it seems like they're trying to stay vague on the specifics. Probably because it's still in alpha and it's possible the specifics could be tweaked or changed before launch."
needforspeed,3bvx4l,ConverseFox,1 point,Fri Jul 3 02:54:03 2015 UTC,"So far everyone wants Forza Horizon 2, and simulation.  There is a really smal minority who wants Burnout handling.   So I really suggest Ghost Games put Forza Horizon 2 like drifting in the game"
needforspeed,3bvx4l,ConverseFox,2,Thu Jul 2 19:07:28 2015 UTC,"It could be possible that setting the Grip/Drift slider somewhere in the middle could blend Grip and Drift to make it handle sort of like Forza Horizon 2. We'll just have to wait and see how it works, really."
needforspeed,3bvx4l,G0bias,1 point,Fri Jul 3 02:57:04 2015 UTC,"I think its fair to say it won't be on the same level as Gran Turismo as that would require an enormous amount of time and resources to create a similar engine on top of the huge open world and amount of customization currently in the game. But FH2 is most definitely possible, as well as being the preferred choice."

needforspeed,3bvx4l,Malvu5,2,Thu Jul 2 23:19:33 2015 UTC,"I loved the Grid drifting but the Horizon 2 drifting is pretty much the same except you can keep a slide going forever if you tuned your car proper and you can also adjust the car during that drift, unlike the Criterion games and some other that just lock you into a direction for the most part. Horizon 2 really added a whole new dimension to drifting so that's how it should be done."
needforspeed,3bvx4l,Craig_Plays_Games,0,Fri Jul 3 16:50:48 2015 UTC,I prefer more realistic drifting like in Forza 5 but I know this game will have shitty arcade drifting like in previous games.

Maybe if you don't have cash to pay the fine they take your ride instead. I also wonder if they will have special units back, like the Rhinos for example or Helicopters. They didn't mention anything about Heat levels either but I think it's safe to assume that it will be more close to something like in Carbon for example rather than the police supercars in Rivals."
needforspeed,3bvzmv,Malvu5,1 point,Fri Jul 3 14:20:27 2015 UTC,"I really really hope that there will be heat levels and road blocks, rhinos, helis, faster cars and spike strips at higher levels."

I'm saying they could use a bit more realism rather than just follow the straight up insane chases in Most Wanted and Rivals. Seriously, they were ridiculous. No PD would have that much money and human lives to risk, even with dozens of street racers. Still, at least they brought back the Crown Vics. Wonder if we'll get to see antagonist characters as well playing as the cops, kinda like how Cross was back in Most Wanted 2005 and Carbon. Would make sense to include super/hyper cars as police cruisers then as well."

needforspeed,3btoe3,REIKU_,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:59:27 2015 UTC,That's great to hear. I was afraid for that Underground kind of system where the game basicly decides what looks good in the means of visual rating. So now the question basicly is will visual upgrades have any effect on your Build rep in NFS15?  And now I can happily build a metallic pink Porsche now that I have Ghost_Ben's approval for it ;)
needforspeed,3btoe3,Malvu5,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:20:07 2015 UTC,"Maybe they'll have a visual rating system like in Underground as well but my main concern was how the performance aspect was gonna play into the Build rep system and this is the perfect way to do it. I'd rather have the visual aspect be just there for just the joy of it and not as a game mechanic like in Underground. I'm saying that because the game mainly forced you to use certain parts to get a higher visual rating. I'd rather have a system that doesn't force you into anything and make your car look exactly how you want to and not get punished for it. Still, I bet we'll get to see the game more in-depth at Gamescom. They also said they'd be showing off some of the story aspects as well.   Also, I know by how the Battlefront Alpha is going that EA's lineup is gonna be the best alongside Fallout 4 and MGS V Phantom Pain this year. Frostbite is quite an insane engine. Battlefront looks every bit as good as how they showed it and runs even better than Battlefield 4.   If Need for Speed is gonna be how they showed it... it's just frankly over for every other racing game."
needforspeed,3btoe3,REIKU_,1 point,Thu Jul 2 16:42:16 2015 UTC,Yeah I'm also afraid of that Underground kind of mentality 'the more you have the better rating / more rep you'll get'. Because that would mean the roads of Ventura Bay would be filled with hideous ricers.  I would love to see a showroom kind of thing or anything else build into the game where you could rate other players car designs (or even buy vinyl wraps created by other players) and you would get reputation from good ratings from other players. But actually we don't know yet for sure if we're even getting a vinyl system for the game.. Any info to give at the moment /u/Ghost_Ben ?

needforspeed,3bqhf4,cyborg_90,8,Wed Jul 1 13:00:46 2015 UTC,I subscribe to every word
needforspeed,3bqhf4,NFSfan,3,Wed Jul 1 10:33:39 2015 UTC,"120% agreed.  Especially the first one. It's a shame they dropped that and single races in the newer games. I also want normal race starts, not like Rivals."
needforspeed,3bqhf4,flipperkip97,3,Wed Jul 1 12:49:44 2015 UTC,"That list looks great so far and with the first two I especially agree with. And what comes to vinyl designs, well actually we don't know yet if we are even getting a vinyl system or just preset wraps. But if we do get to make our own designs I hope we'll have enough layers for the vinyls. There was 20 layers in NFS World if I remember correctly and it wasn't quite enough especially if you wanted a design with a lot of decals. And second thing that should be self-evident is the possibility to mirror vinyls to the other side of the car. Also it is sometimes important to get the exact same color as you've used before and as we can see in the customization video when painting the car there was only sliders and no numeric value or anything else that you could use to 'identify' that spesific tone.  So basicly my wishlist involve a vinyl design system similar to NFSW but with more layers and bigger selection of vinyls and decals. And a way of knowing a spesific tone of color you've used. Another thing that would be nice is a way of getting your car designs rated or even sold to other players (without having to lose the car yourself)"
needforspeed,3bqhf4,REIKU_,3,Wed Jul 1 13:26:15 2015 UTC,Manual transmission should be on there.

needforspeed,3bqhf4,INFsleeper,2,Wed Jul 1 16:18:56 2015 UTC,"I completely agree.     The drifting is my biggest worry, I'm totally okay with an arcade non-SIM driving style but it still needs to feel rewarding!!  Not just turn left to drift left and it auto counter steers for you.  Like a lot of people have been saying, FH2 does this very well.  Leave that on rails crap for those lame mobile games.  The steering should really feel responsive and rewarding.  The E3 trailer showed very on-rails drifting IMO, there was no weight transfer, scrubbing speed or managing angle and counter steer.  That worries me.   Competitive multiplayer would be a lot of fun and hugely increase the longevity of the game, my biggest worry here is the ability for people to grief (intentionally slam people into walls etc) and hack.   As for customization I'm really hoping for an in depth vinyl system that has good QoL features like saving patterns and being able to mirror them.  Also, like stated by OP there should really be a customize mode outside of the career!!!  I REALLY don't want to have to sell a car to experience and have fun with a different one."

needforspeed,3bndpj,armanddd,9,Tue Jun 30 17:26:40 2015 UTC,"First of all people need to stop complaining and whining about every fucking little thing on this sub. (It's incredibly insulting to the Ghost who've already shown they listen to us fans.) Especially about every rumour that pops up, really not much has been confirmed at this point, and we've hardly seen any gameplay. The only gameplay we've seen was PRE-ALPHA, and a drift attack mode, with a widly eager swaying camera.  Secondly, nothing's been confirmed about NFS 2015's handling model, apart from the fact that we'll be able to choose between grip and drift, and there'll be a few options to tweak and tune the car. We have no idea exactly how all this will affect the car. Let's at least give them the benefit of the doubt for now, shall we? Or have you not seen any of this? If you haven't, at least do your research before complaining.   Third, NFS has always been an arcade game. (""Need for Speed is becoming too arcade"" When was it not? Apart from Shift, but if you want a successor to Shift there's Project Cars) The idea behind was always to sell the biggest number of copies, which means having the most accessible handling model possible. There are always going to be compromises.   Lastly, you keep citing Forza as an example, yes I'm sure everyone would be happy having the same physics engine as Forza Horizon, I think even the developers would love to have it too. But guess what, this is the real world, and physics engines aren't made overnight. FH and FH2 had access to the Forza engine, they just had to tweak a few things to make it a bit more accessible. NFS would have needed a new physics engine, and most likely quite a few new members of the team to make it. Maybe if we're vocal enough, show them that with a new, less arcadey engine they will sell more copies, we might get it on the next NFS.   And let me just say I hate the Criterion handling as much as you, and hardly played the last NFS because of it."
needforspeed,3bndpj,ConverseFox,2,Tue Jun 30 23:03:18 2015 UTC,"Well, the game will have a Grip/Drift slider. Now, I don't know how exactly it'll work, but they've said that Drift is like the more recent (New Hot Pursuit, New Most Wanted, Rivals) games with the Criterion style drifting and that Grip is more like the older games. I don't remember hearing any examples of which older games they were talking about though.  The thing we don't know is understanding how exactly this will work with it being a slider. This means there either has to be a point on the slider where the drifting changes from the Criterion to the old school, or they've managed to blend them together which is probably the more likely scenario(and might be interesting to play around with). Only if Grip actually means drifting like the old school games of course.  Either way, if Grip actually means drifting like Underground and Underground 2, then you bet I'll be playing exclusively on max Grip."

needforspeed,3bndpj,G0bias,2,Wed Jul 1 00:03:31 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Hopefully the over the top power-sliding through an almost hairpin turn at 130mph was strictly to woo the E3 crowd and not a real representation of the car physics and handling in the final product.   Because let's be honest, what's the point of doing the whole accurate portrayal of the drifting scene with drift attacks, actual licensed aftermarket parts and real-life drifting icons like Vaughn Gittin or Ken Block if it feels nothing like actual drifting?

NFS has weirdly played a big part in my life.  My dad and I used to play hot pursuit together way back in the day, it's how we became friends and not just family.  My distant cousin and I bonded over NFS:U2 and it's formed a strong relationship that we still have to this day - now we literally both own 2 of our favorite cars from the games!  (I have an s13 240sx and an old impreza, he has an sti and a G35)...  NFS:U was the first video game I ever owned.

Sometimes it goes out for hours or a whole day.  This means (assuming this AO DRM is like others) every 2 hours or so, NFS will just shut down on me or prevent me from playing, maybe in the middle of a big race or while I'm working on some cool car and I could lose that progress.  And if I want to play it on a day where my internet is out? Too bad.  If their servers go down (which happens often enough, especially during launch) then NOBODY gets to play.  All because they want to make sure I didn't pirate the game I bought.  Now that being said it isn't the end of the world or a deal breaker or whatever, but it sure is a nuisance.  For someone with ""normal"" internet yeah, it rarely if ever will get in your way so its no big deal, always online isn't THAT bad but its just an annoyance that doesn't seem to give the consumer any benefits."

Just remember  you never tricked your car out fully you would always unlock a new bumper or wheels you wanted to put on. i think they are going for the same here. In real life project cars dont get done in a night and you go buy another one. They take months to finish starting with small details and going on till you put the final touch on the car months later. 5 car limit is completely fine. The only problem i see with this is online. Eventually you will have to start replacing cars with ""new projects"" you get bored of your rx7 time to get a 2jz twin turbo  supra project going on  sell rx7 to fund the supra project"
needforspeed,3blsze,gagewgnr,1 point,Tue Jun 30 19:38:08 2015 UTC,"I'm perfectly fine with the 5 car limit. If the customization is very deep (which it certainly looks like) it actually makes sense. The limit means that selling and buying a new one represents more of an important decision than an after-thought while still keeping things fresh. Without forcing you to keep the same car, it encourages you to invest more time in it and thus allowing you to establish more of a connection with it. Having the sense of unlocking different options and parts as you progress through the game, taking your time choosing the build you're going for, gaining reputation not only as a driver but through the car. All elements I really enjoyed from NFS U2. They could always increase the limit progressively as they add more cars after launch."

It's hard to believe that in 2015 we don't have the means to store more than five cars in our garages, considering there have been other games doing it for ages. Giving us an open world and endless customization are both great, but then limiting us to only five options kind of puts a damper on things. What possible harm could having variety and options bring? It'd be nice to at least have the option to purchase additional warehouse/storage/garage space if you plan on going over the five car limit."

needforspeed,3bmytk,Ray229harris,3,Tue Jun 30 14:56:51 2015 UTC,"That could just get out of hand with people exploiting it. I'm thinking it would be better for people to share ""templates"" or ""blueprints"" of cars. Imagine customizing a car just the way you like. Now, you could share that publicly with everyone who plays the game and everyone can preview it if they have the car in their garage.   I think this is an almost must have feature since I always see comments on Carbon and Underground videos of people asking others how they made their cars look the way they did, what parts they used, what colors and so on.   So, rather than selling the actual cars and having that be exploitable and the devs having to worry about balancing that, it would be best if they used this sort of system.   I think Forza Horizion 2 has a similar system. They should just use that instead of a car auction house. Trust me, I played tons of MMO games and every auction house in those games is just out of hand with anal prices trying to nickle and dime other players.   Best way is to keep this free, simple and easy. Besides, the whole point is to make the cars you have your own personal machines, your own cars should reflect you and not just copy other people's designs."

needforspeed,3bmytk,Malvu5,1 point,Tue Jun 30 15:47:05 2015 UTC,"Like I said, it's way too exploitable. Doesn't matter if it's offline or online. Besides, they already confirmed you can have only 5 cars and are able to sell them. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndUXYnVBsUw"
needforspeed,3bmytk,Malvu5,1 point,Tue Jun 30 15:50:07 2015 UTC,"Yeah i saw that video, that's what made me think of it. When i say a Craigslist type of style, i don't actually mean selling it actual online players. I mean selling it to other npcs in the game. Like NFS creating a program of sorts that says ""Car cost this much originally minus how many times it's been repainted plus parts spent on it minus how much heat on the car, etc.   Then they spit out a number and that's how much your car is"" worth""  Then someguy offers you ""that much"" and tries to haggle or whatever, and you take it or not, et cetera et cetera."
needforspeed,3bmytk,ShiroQ,1 point,Tue Jun 30 16:05:51 2015 UTC,"I can see the value in that over the way it was previously in Carbon and Underground where it was a preset value but the biggest flaw with that is making it a balanced feature that isn't something exploitable. Besides, it doesn't fit in the universe and by the looks of it, since you also can only have 5 cars, they'll most likely be pretty hard to get. It just wouldn't work, it doesn't fit in with the universe they created and it's just too prone to exploits.   Besides, the only flaw with this entry so far is the ""always online DRM"" and I really hope Ghost isn't trying to emulate The Crew or it could very well be the end of the series like Sim City. Rivals was already quite a mess but at least you can play that offline. None of this will even matter if the game is dead after a few years, servers shutdown and no one can play it. So far we don't know for sure if the game will even be online only or even playable offline so I'd rather people wait and not pre-order. I'm all for playing with other players and having online events and so on, I can see the value in online but it will just end up sinking the game ultimately, like Sim City. EA shut down Maxis because of it. I don't want this to be the last Need for Speed game."
needforspeed,3bmytk,Malvu5,0,Tue Jun 30 16:12:44 2015 UTC,easy way to go around the exploit is to add a cap for car prices. Make the game calculate money spent on the car and give a range of how much more or less for you can sell the car. They did it in fifa 16 ultimate tea by giving a range for player prices. So you cannot sell a bronze player for 10 million (thats what people did who bough coins from the coin traders)
needforspeed,3bmytk,ShiroQ,2,Tue Jun 30 19:51:48 2015 UTC,"This isn't car salesman simulator. You can already sell the cars. Pretty sure they'll work out internally the prices and so on to make sense. And besides, this wasn't an issue in any previous NFS titles. Ghost is already doing a ton of different things (5 storylines, adjustable car handling, huge variety of game modes, deep customization, etc.) so having them shift focus on this now as well will most likely net us something that is half-done, unbalanced, exploitable and broken. Trust me, as cool as this would sound it isn't needed and would even be out of place in the setting. Like I said, you're playing as a street racer and not a car salesman.  I think the most they could do is to add value to the car based on the price of your modifications but even then it should be less than what you spent for it so you couldn't make money just by selling cars, other than that, haggling shouldn't really make you money or at most it should come close to breaking even but still being less than what you spent overall.   Besides, I bet making money and getting cars should be very easy by the endgame so it will be pointless having a feature like this at that point.   Again, like I said, this isn't car salesman simulator, you aren't supposed to make money off selling cars. You're a street racer, your cars should be a reflection of yourself. Also, I suspect since there's a 5 car limit and with the 5 ways to play is that you'll want to have a car suited specifically for each and that's the main focus of the game, with the 5 ways to play."
needforspeed,3bmytk,Malvu5,0,Tue Jun 30 20:08:06 2015 UTC,"uh what do you mean you are not supposed to make money of cars? why the fck would i sell my car to some scrub for less then i paid for it? have you played forza? good cars were always more expensive thats the point of selling cars. Why add a feature to sell cars to another player if you cant profit of it? i spend hours in making it awesome and you want me to give it away for free? ty but no.  The price limits as i said are to prevent cheaters. Giving cars away for free  or cash sellers that would grind money in the game and sell it for real world currency.  The developer said there will be 5 cars limit with a comment ""if you even manage to get 5"" which means it will be difficult thats why people are talking about selling their cars to other people for some little profit to fund their next project once the space frees up. Also your comment about ""you are street racer"" sorry but have you ever seen someone build their project car and sell it for less than they invested in? obviously they would sell for less if the car is runned down and has been used for years after the initial project. But there is no wear in games ..."
needforspeed,3bmytk,ShiroQ,1 point,Tue Jun 30 20:37:46 2015 UTC,"Can you like, not read or something? It would be too easy to make money if all you did was sell customized cars all the time. You're supposed to earn money through building your rep and your driving skill rather than exploiting the car selling shenanigans. There would be no point in anything costing money at that point or they might as well give you infinite money. I agree you should at the very least come close to breaking even, but it should be less than what you spent overall, so people aren't encouraged to exploit it and be smart about whether they want to sell their car or not and what they do with their cars overall."
needforspeed,3bmytk,Malvu5,0,Wed Jul 1 08:21:53 2015 UTC,how is it exploiting? if you want my car you have to pay lets say 100k i made it with 80k So the reason someone would buy my car because it looks awesome drives awesome and someone does not know how to make one look/drive the same. How is it exploiting if its hard to make money. other players need to get money from somewhere too so they earn money and buy a car from you thats how you earn. But a not rich player wouldnt buy a car from someone he would build his own because it would end up most likely cheaper. If you did not notice we are talking about player market not selling cars for profit to the NPC shops ...

needforspeed,3bjls0,VTiRoj,1 point,Tue Jun 30 06:01:36 2015 UTC,"I think the newer NFS games don't have this, which is REALLY disappointing. Same with split screen play."
needforspeed,3bjls0,flipperkip97,2,Tue Jun 30 07:18:38 2015 UTC,"I think this was great in Test Drive Unlimited 2. There was a limit of your garage, but with enough money you could extend this by buying a new garage. So you had to decide, if you want to spend your money on customizing the cars you have, or to buy new garages to extend your collection.  The limit to 5 cars only makes sense to me, when you can trade them with other players. Without a limit i would surely never sell one of my cars."
needforspeed,3bjls0,miningrush,2,Tue Jun 30 12:04:03 2015 UTC,5 car limit doesnt make sense. There are WAY more than 5 cars I want to own
needforspeed,3bjls0,trickeh2k,2,Tue Jun 30 12:55:13 2015 UTC,"Seems quite odd to me if it were limited to 5, I mean why? It's a virtual garage, you can make it big or just implement more garages. I like to collect all cars if possible. The only reason I could see me not owning a few is if they were horribly underpowered towards other cars.  Then we have the obligatory DLC cars, were will we store them? I don't think anyone wants to sell a car they fought hard for, customized etc just to make room for a new car that's maybe not that fun to drive anyway.  Seeing that DLC cars usually comes in packs of 3 as well... well, they'e either going with another business model or have something else in store. What if I actually LOVE all of my five cars? It's the cars I really wanted in the games, I got the visual styling I want and I love how they drive, you're then going to force me to sell it because of a limit to five cars?  Oh that that sodding panthaa, can't stand the money greeding bastard."
needforspeed,3bjls0,Malvu5,1 point,Tue Jun 30 08:28:45 2015 UTC,"Only thing that would make sense in having a limit of 5 cars is having one specialized for each style in the game. As in one car for Speed, one for Build, one for Style, one for Crew and the last one for Outlaw. Other than that, probably having to pay for a ""premium garage"" DLC or something... Still, if it makes sense in the universe it should be fine. From what I hear it should also be pretty hard to even get 5 cars in the first place."
needforspeed,3bjls0,trickeh2k,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:58:11 2015 UTC,"I still really can't see the point with limiting a virtual garage. As with any other racing game I like to mix the cars I'm driving, if there's only one dedicated car for each mode then it'll become boring using the same car over and over again.  Also, I can't see how they're gonna make DLC cars with a 5 car limit. Would you be forced then to sell your current cars just to try out new ones?   Idk, but it seems like they're focusing a bit too much on ""going back to the roots"" with the 5 car limit. Yes, it was in UG2 for example but that wasn't a key feature that made the game good.   In other racing games, if I knew i was pitted against drivers under my skill level I'd choose a slower car to increase the challenge and in HP 2010 for instance, one of the first cars you unlocked in the lowest tier was one of the best.  We'll see, there's a lot of time until the game is out and we know just about nothing about the game so it's perhaps stupid to start complaining too much at this time but still, it just doesn't make any sense to me."

needforspeed,3bjls0,BRod_Angel,0,Mon Jun 29 19:52:10 2015 UTC,Yes 10 would be perfect! Or maybe add a 'storage' system where you can still have 5 cars in your garage but you can add your extra cars to a storage. You cant visually see them when in storage and it will take 24 real hours to transfer them between your garage and storage. That is perfect in my opinion

needforspeed,3bj0ix,ConverseFox,3,Mon Jun 29 17:48:37 2015 UTC,"SimCity released with an always online restriction. The game itself was bad, but the always online restriction kind of tipped over the community's respect/hope for the future of the SimCity franchise.

And I guess there will be a few rock/metal tracks but nothing really heavy. So basicly music that's popular in that certain kind of car culture that this NFS seems to be focused.  I personally like the 4 tracks that have been revealed already, they seem to fit the atmosphere of the game perfectly. I don't really see the game having any older tracks and I bet we're going to have lots of new (2014 and 2015) songs. Names like Diplo, DJ Snake, Apashe, Let's Be Friends, JOYRYDE come in my mind, maybe even Jack Ü or new Knife Party/Pendulum tracks could be there.

""You get the driving (locations) that you had in Rivals, Carbon and Underground"" - and stuff in-between. When the police are after you, you can choose to immediately stop and just pay a (smaller) fine and continue with no cops (if you are on the way to something and don't want to spend time losing them in a long chase)    I'm gonna stay at the positives.

needforspeed,3bd0ax,ConverseFox,3,Sun Jun 28 02:53:35 2015 UTC,I'm not sure. It would need a lot more content if they were to release a remastered version today. And that would pretty much take as long as making a whole new NFS.

I really hope to see continued dedication to the game when it's released and not like Rivals who just got one or two patches around launch and then was left to die with only the mandatory dlc cars rolled out.  Bring patches, optimization new features etc. If you want it to be THE definitive title, make sure it gets proper treatment after it launched. With no beta testing (at least yet), there's bound to be some problems with it.  I'd like to see an expansion to the game after a year or so instead of a completely new game. If the core gameplay and mode are good, continue to build the visual customization deeper. We want a vinlyling system so we can make unique cars and not just preset decals."

Seriously though, I don't mind the Huracan but I hope it doesn't mean we have a lot of high end cars. That's not what these games are about, and I think the high end 'exotics' hurt MW/Carbon."
needforspeed,3bckdn,houbsurf,3,Sun Jun 28 03:09:19 2015 UTC,"Need for Speed started out purely about the exotics and super cars of the day.   I don't see the need to change that, if I wanted to drive everyday attainable cars I'd get forza/gran turismo."
needforspeed,3bckdn,booplouie,4,Sun Jun 28 04:24:28 2015 UTC,"It started out as that sure, but that's not the 'roots' they're returning to, they're returning to the 'Underground' roots.  As I said, Marcus literally said they are going for more 'attainable' cars because that fits in with the car culture they're going for, which seems to contradict the inclusion of a Lambo."
needforspeed,3bckdn,houbsurf,2,Sun Jun 28 05:09:18 2015 UTC,I should remind you there has always been supercars in the NFS series except in Underground. I don't see why there shouldn't be a Huracán in the next game.
needforspeed,3bckdn,Trololman72,1 point,Sun Jun 28 10:39:02 2015 UTC,"But as I said, the reboot is more or less a spiritual successor to the Underground games with elements of MW/Carbon thrown in. Supercars were not a part of UG1/2 and thus shouldn't have much of a role (if any) in this NFS."
needforspeed,3bckdn,houbsurf,1 point,Sun Jun 28 10:41:19 2015 UTC,IMO this reboot looks way more like Carbon than any other NFS game. And there was a lot of supercars in Carbon.
needforspeed,3bckdn,Trololman72,1 point,Sun Jun 28 10:42:39 2015 UTC,"I would presume that the main reason you say that is because of the art style/environment... visually, it looks the most like Carbon, but I think at its essence its' #1 inspiration is UG2."
needforspeed,3bckdn,houbsurf,1 point,Sun Jun 28 12:54:28 2015 UTC,Well the inspiration definitely isn't Unerground 2 as there's the Huracán. And modern sports cars like the 911 GT3 RS and the M4. Also the Underground series had nothing like Porsches.
needforspeed,3bckdn,Trololman72,1 point,Sun Jun 28 15:41:47 2015 UTC,"Illegal street races, downtown LA, the style of music, night-time only, main focus deep customization, aftermarket parts, drift events, cars like Skyline GT-R and 180sx.. Nope, definitely no inspiration from Underground.  Also, in many of the interviews with Marcus N. he very much describes it as being urban/underground mood. Despite the more exotic cars, it's definitely more like Underground than say Rivals or Hot Pursuit.  Honestly didn't even think it was arguable anymore, with the info we've gotten so far."
needforspeed,3bckdn,kezorN,1 point,Sun Jun 28 20:13:59 2015 UTC,What you described is Carbon.
needforspeed,3bckdn,UsernameNumber6,1 point,Sun Jun 28 21:15:38 2015 UTC,Have you ever played Carbon? It's got all of that plus supercars and muscle cars.

Just because some people don't want them, why should everyone be deprived of them?   And how did exotics ""hurt"" MW/Carbon? You could easily finish the game without ever using one."
needforspeed,3bckdn,armanddd,3,Sun Jun 28 14:27:38 2015 UTC,"This. Personally I loved having exotics in Carbon. They brought a very different ""elite"" atmosphere to the game.   I think the misconception people are making about this game is that you expect it to be a successor to U1/U2, MW and Carbon. But that's what it isn't. They said its a reboot drawing inspiration from their previous awesomeness. Personally I felt Carbon brought everything we asked of it. Nocturnal Racing. Tuners. Supercars. Muscle. Drift. Sprints. Tougé (canyon, if you will). And to top it all, that beautiful customization we loved in Underground (albeit, with a fewer options)."
needforspeed,3bckdn,kezorN,1 point,Sun Jun 28 16:05:40 2015 UTC,"It makes sense that there should be cars for everyone, but you also need to stay in a somewhat realistic range/variety of cars. If it is indeed an Underground-type game, which most info points to, then it is a strange choice of cars. Insanely expensive exotic supercars hardly belong in the Underground environment.   EA/Ghost are the ones that are talking about realism in the story and gameplay. People are just reacting to what they're seeing vs. what they're saying."
needforspeed,3bckdn,armanddd,1 point,Sun Jun 28 20:18:07 2015 UTC,"We're supposed to be able to customize every car, so the only exotics we'll get will probably be Liberty Walk ones anyway. And the RWB Porsches.   Personally I just hope for a varied car list, and some surprises. I hope we get more than just the same RX7, AE86, R34, Supra bla bla... we get in every game."
needforspeed,3bckdn,Trololman72,1 point,Sun Jun 28 20:33:38 2015 UTC,"The Huracán isn't an ""insanely expensive exotic supercar"". Heck, there was a CCX in Carbon..."

needforspeed,3bckdn,kezorN,1 point,Mon Jun 29 17:01:29 2015 UTC,"Well, that's your opinion. I for one, loved every bit of Carbon.   His point is that the CCX is an insanely exotic supercar. The Huracán, in comparison, isn't."
needforspeed,3bckdn,houbsurf,1 point,Mon Jun 29 21:53:30 2015 UTC,"Now the discussion is about which of those two supercars can be considered ""insanely expensive"" over just ""really expensive""? That was not the point I was trying to make. I was just talking about the Underground games, and that I personally don't at all think that exotic supercars (insanely expensive or really expensive alike) belong in those games, and neither in the new game that has the same Underground look/feel to it.  It ruins the realism for some of us - and yes others don't care about it, I realize that. That was my point. Also don't mean to sound angry or anything, just trying to explain what I meant by the above."
needforspeed,3bckdn,armanddd,1 point,Mon Jun 29 23:33:23 2015 UTC,"Because it goes against the car culture they're going for in the game.. quite frankly, 'supercars' are out of place in this game."

needforspeed,3be2xz,houbsurf,1 point,Sun Jun 28 10:39:31 2015 UTC,We had it in U u2 MW carbon and prostreet. Why cant we have it now too? Also dragraces will be a bit hard without manual
needforspeed,3be2xz,Redimo,1 point,Sun Jun 28 21:07:58 2015 UTC,Arcade machine with a gear stick.  So your argument is that arcade racers needn't have a manual option? Even the shittiest of arcade racing games at actual arcades allow for manual transmissions. NFS is a LOT less arcadey than people give it credit for.
needforspeed,3be2xz,Dk_krypton,-3,Thu Jul 2 02:02:55 2015 UTC,"I don't understand how that's even a valid argument and people seem to be using it quite a lot. Was Underground 2 a simulator? Obviously not but I still had the option to be in control of my gears. Going by your argument, you're saying that a manual transmission option somehow deters the game from its arcade-ness because you said that its not suited for it. Can we at least be given an option? If not for the sake of realism, or control over the car's handling, then at least for the sake of having the immersion of being a street racer, which is something that the devs are really pushing in their trailers and twitter feeds."
needforspeed,3be2xz,houbsurf,5,Sun Jun 28 10:54:31 2015 UTC,"There's definitely nothing wrong with including it - for people who prefer it, I hope that it's added later in development, but for the most part, people enjoy arcade racers because they're accessible to play, and with the amount of over the top stuff that goes on in the game from unrealistic drifting to cop chases, it just seems like it's less suited here.  Again, nothing wrong with it, but manual transmission is naturally of a much higher priority in a more sim-oriented racing title."
needforspeed,3be2xz,Dk_krypton,3,Sun Jun 28 12:53:01 2015 UTC,"I don't understand why everyone's downvoting you. That's a perfectly valid argument, and it strikes a chord with me.

needforspeed,3be2xz,Kirasath,1 point,Sun Jun 28 14:41:58 2015 UTC,"I don't mind it not being included, and would love it implemented in a later update or whatever, but it's an arcade game and I personally don't really see it as all that advantageous when the game already had a lot of stuff going on."
needforspeed,3be2xz,trickeh2k,2,Sun Jun 28 15:48:34 2015 UTC,"This topic has already been discussed and my answer on it is. He played the same game we saw in the trailer and that also means that if they were lacking manual transmission (probably not high priority) they might add it later in development. The gameplay was from a pre-alpha engine (!PRE-ALPHA!), which is a fairly early stage in development and there's still 4 months of work until the release. Just wait til' gamescom for more information."

But that's not important.    the hell kind of gibberish you talking about ,   What? None of what I've said is gibberish, you're quoting a Swedish guy who didn't sound like he could answer half the questions.    they clearly stated that the game takes place in the underground scene when races happen at night and not during day    So the ENTIRE game takes place at night because they said that, gotcha. You ever play underground 1 and 2 or rivals? They didn't clearly state anything if you're referring to the e3 video, they showed 3 minutes of customization and 3 minutes tops of actual game play outside of the garage. Every need open world NFS has had day and night cycles.  Unless you have some special inside information where the devs and publishers say clearly ""there's no day and night, only night, bcus it's underground racing, duhh"" Shut the fuck up.   Edit: Nevermind, you're right they're going to have it only be at night, unlike every open NFS, that makes sense.

needforspeed,3ba9gv,HokieSpeed,2,Sat Jun 27 12:34:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I like the idea but here's a few things:   Even though we are all car guys, it's two different movies. NFS and F&F were meant to compete in a way, albeit they didn't. It ain't show friends, it's show business.  On top of that, Forza gave us all the cars (kind of) and you can make the rest. Luckily the mods in the Supra, GTR, and the old Skyline are pretty easy. I'd bet my XBox we will have plenty of tribute cars in roaming"
needforspeed,3ba9gv,Gerarghini,4,Sat Jun 27 14:37:17 2015 UTC,The underground series would've been far less successful had it not been for F&F. I think it's in good taste for NFS to do something to give thanks or a tribute of some sorts.

needforspeed,3b5zdy,ArchieK,7,Fri Jun 26 18:40:37 2015 UTC,"200 cars is a bit ambitious for NFS. My must have list consists of:  Great customization (check)  Modern tuner atmosphere (check)  Good variety of popular cars to ""stance""  Big open world (check)  Solid servers  Good police AI   Good variety of race types   To be honest, I have never ever used a manual transmission in any Need for Speed except for Shift and Shift 2. It's more of an arcade racer, not a complex race sim. It should still be in the game though.   I'm going to get a lot of shit for saying this, but I could care less if the game is online or not. 90% of all the games I play, I play online whether it be with or without friends. Plus, they've already confirmed that you can disable other players in the session, ultimately creating your own lobby/game. Now, after I've said that, I can still see where it might get a little rough if they shut down the servers or if you truly want or need to play offline. Hell, maybe they'll have a system like TDU 2.

needforspeed,3b5zdy,midarete,1 point,Sat Jun 27 01:59:54 2015 UTC,"200 cars is not going to happen, I'd expect about 40 at launch. Most already look to be JDM with some muscle and supercars. There is also lots of customization already seen at E3.   2.""Unforgettable Soundtrack"" is likely but it would not be too similar to past NFS games (more like Rivals and MW 2012).   The story-line already looks engaging with real world car scene people as major characters. Variety of races looks likely as they have added event types for this game. Map has been confirmed to be twice the size of the Rivals map with city roads like Underground 2 or MW and also mountain roads like Rivals and HP 2010. http://www.needforspeed.com/en_AU/news/ventura-bay Removing always online is possible but not at launch, it may be patched out in the future like SimCity. I think there will be microtransactions but they will be like in the Crew (unnecessary to progress). I don't know about DLC but there shouldn't be Day 1 DLC."

There's already been some good suggestions and lists but I'll try to make mine and it's also kind of what I believe it'll be.  NISSAN - R32 to R35 (there might be only R32 or R33) - 2000 GT-R - S13 to S15 - 350Z and 370Z - 300zx (not sure if this will make it to the game) - 240zg  MITSUBISHI - Evo 9 and X (maybe some older ones too) - Eclipse maybe (I think 2nd gen) - 3000gt?  MAZDA - FD and FC RX7 - RX8 - Miata - They also might add Mazdaspeed 3 but I personally don't care about it  TOYOTA - Supra mk4 and mk3 or mk2 - AE86 - GT86 - Aristo (hope so)  SUBARU - Well BRZ ofc - Two or three Imprezas  HONDA - NSX - S2000 - Hatchback Civic - Maybe an Integra  AUDI - R8 - TT - Some 4 and 5 series - RS1  Then some Bimmers and Porsches (but I don't think there's going to be Carrera GT or Spyder shiznits) maybe some Mercedes not sure about those, at least I don't need any. Then an Aston Martin or too propably and max 3 Lambos. Hopefully a Lexus or two and VW Golf (R32 or GTI, Mk1 too pls) and Scirocco. And only a few american cars (maybe a DLC with more..) and hopefully no hypercars (and NO dlc or speedboost thing where you can get those!). Also no for any bigger cars like pickups or SUV's.  Hmm, I guess that was it... Oh yeah the Ferraris, I'm not sure if they'll get any in the game but if they do I hope they won't add anything that wouldn't fit the game. Maybe just 458 and F40.

That car is gorgeous and its sounds phenomenal as well!) Porsche 911 Carrera GTS (I wouldn't mind one honestly.) The new Honda NSX. These are just off the top of my head.  Also, I'd rather have the new MX-5 to the first gen. Might as well stick with the times.  The Supra has GOT to be there. Along with the RX-8, The Skyline R34. The Evo X. The 2015 Impreza WRX STi.

They are sleek, agile, and lightweight. Put enough power behind one and it'll slide for days.

needforspeed,3b0pn6,trickeh2k,3,Thu Jun 25 01:15:35 2015 UTC,I saw someone who made this from the gameplay trailer. https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xpf1/t31.0-8/1890490_565771900231291_1539111953988741729_o.jpg  Seems like the area that was available on E3 was quite small judging that map. Well done btw :)

needforspeed,3b0pn6,jft642,2,Thu Jun 25 11:03:48 2015 UTC,is it twice the size of the actual area of the map or the miles of roads?
needforspeed,3b0pn6,Banarax,2,Thu Jun 25 18:14:47 2015 UTC,"I've always wondered that too. I hope it's the actual area of the map, because although rivals was big, the amount of asphalt was ridiculously low."

needforspeed,3azphs,d12gu,8,Wed Jun 24 20:18:44 2015 UTC,"I found MW12 enjoyable. It's a pickup and play arcadey racer with a pretty decent car list. It's easy enough to beat and you have no limitations like ""reach level 2 before you can use this car"". Just drive up to a new whip and hop in. Proceed to win the game. It's even more enjoyable online, and if you have people to play with it's that much better. The dlc does add some cool stuff, but it's a bit of a grind to unlock the colored smoke online. I'm not sure if ppl still play it online but when they did it was pretty competitive if you want a challenge. All around, I found it to be a good ""just for funsies"" game to play online."
needforspeed,3azphs,RoshiFluttershy,0,Wed Jun 24 20:33:08 2015 UTC,"I usually don't play online, so i guess thats another downside to it..."
needforspeed,3azphs,RoshiFluttershy,2,Wed Jun 24 21:22:01 2015 UTC,"Ooh, yeah. Online was the main reason it was fun. It can be fun for a while in SP, but after you unlock everything and beat story mode, there's nothing to do except free roam/ run from the cops."
needforspeed,3azphs,RoshiFluttershy,2,Wed Jun 24 23:00:19 2015 UTC,How much time would you say it takes to beat the single player? Burnout paradise was heavily multiplayer-targeted but it did have a pretty solid single player mode.
needforspeed,3azphs,RoshiFluttershy,2,Thu Jun 25 21:00:04 2015 UTC,"It really depends how you play it. There's a MW list like in '05, but the list is shorter and much easier. The fact that you have access to every non DLC car excluding the MW list from the beginning of the game is huge too. The game does alter AI difficulty depending on the car you drive, but certain cars are just unbeatable. It's possible to beat in one session, if you try hard enough, but I personally wanted to collect every car first so it took me longer, especially when you have to beat 5 races or so per car to upgrade it."
needforspeed,3azphs,flipperkip97,1 point,Thu Jun 25 21:54:45 2015 UTC,"You could, however, pick one car that isn't on the list, Fully upgrade it, and just go for the list, maybe win in like anywhere from 1-4 hours depending on how many retries you take and how fast you drive in each race. That's the smarter route, cuz you can upgrade the rest of the cars whenever, but getting the top 10 cars is pretty helpful early on."

If you haven't and can find a seller at a reasonable price I would definitely recommend them. Plenty of customization plus Undercover is similar to 05 MW with cop chases (albeit not as good).  The only ""new"" NFS game I played after Undercover was The Run - although haven't tried any of the others - and I enjoyed that, although it's of course very linear, no open-world and fairly short, I still had a pretty good time with it.

needforspeed,3b0j4f,trickeh2k,2,Thu Jun 25 08:53:43 2015 UTC,"Some people think you're effectively paying for a rental, when the servers are shut down in a few years you won't be able to play anymore. There's also the fact that there are people who don't always have access to a stable connection. And even for most people, sometimes your connection goes down, other times you go on vacation to the middle of bumfuck nowhere where there's no internet. It happens. And some are worried that when the game is launched, the servers will be overloaded and nobody will be able to play, like it was the case for almost all other always online games. And NFS isn't a MMO there's no reason for it to be always online."
needforspeed,3b0j4f,armanddd,0,Thu Jun 25 10:03:11 2015 UTC,"Well, the part about the servers going offline is kind of true. Yet they tend to keep the servers online for quite a while but it's a valid point. As for stable connections, that's gotta be a pretty small part of the players by now. I don't think I have outage of my internetservice more than 1-2 times a year and usually fixes itself within 20 minutes.  Don't think there's any reason for servers being overloaded causing a problem, if that would happen it would just be for a few days anyways.   It's hard to build a game focused on an idea with the whole core of the game is to race with others. Anyways, just as with Rivals, there's an option to set the session to private and you won't have to deal with requirement of as much bandwidth etc.  However, I think the biggest part is probably to hinder piracy. Not happening on consoles really, just PC. I certainly don't see it as a problem, but that's me. Thanks for your valid inputs though!"

needforspeed,3awvuv,INFsleeper,10,Thu Jun 25 14:32:00 2015 UTC,Honestly the handling looks like shit in general to me and that worries me. In the e3 video they went from 150 mph to like 40 in what mist have been 100 meters. Then did a hair pin drift. Its ridiculous. Looks like it came out of asphalt 8
needforspeed,3awvuv,DSTakumiDerp,4,Wed Jun 24 07:41:29 2015 UTC,"Saying that the handling is shit based on a few minutes of gameplay is kinda bold statement. They've said you will have the options to have handling similar to either Most Wanted '05 or, as we saw in the video more like Hot Pursuit 2010.  Game is still five months away so there might pop up more options for handling. The tricky thing is to please both sides AND not make either of the handling setups have a huge advantage over the other.  I'm happy with the options to choose different kind of setups tbh, I will go as much towards sim as the game offers as I find that more enjoyable."
needforspeed,3awvuv,trickeh2k,0,Wed Jun 24 10:15:30 2015 UTC,"The handling in the gameplay was a lot like Rivals, BUT fortunately, we can move the ""slider"" more to grip than to drift, to get handling more like UG/MW.  But then there's still a problem, because most people will probably use the drifting style for racing online, because it's faster and that makes that it's harder to win when you're driving the real NFS style."
needforspeed,3awvuv,flipperkip97,2,Wed Jun 24 11:18:54 2015 UTC,I think the grip one will be more like The Run.

Hopefully the track-list will be good enough that it'll create a similar connection."
needforspeed,3aw546,houbsurf,2,Wed Jun 24 01:21:49 2015 UTC,"I honestly like the soundtrack so far. We get some Chemical Brothers and Aero Chord. I don't know about you, but that is some epic racing music IMO."
needforspeed,3aw546,Allegiance10,1 point,Thu Jun 25 01:07:11 2015 UTC,Exactly. It's shaping up nicely so far.
needforspeed,3aw546,houbsurf,3,Thu Jun 25 23:08:59 2015 UTC,If you are getting it on PS4 you can listen to the Underground 1&2 playlist on spotify :) You can control volume and next / prev track from the PS dashboard :)
needforspeed,3aw546,INFsleeper,3,Wed Jun 24 11:47:50 2015 UTC,"I'm getting it on PC, so worst case scenario I'll either make my own playlist, or just have some of those songs running in the background. Thanks though."
needforspeed,3aw546,INFsleeper,1 point,Wed Jun 24 12:03:23 2015 UTC,yeah I am running a 2 screen setup so I can have spotify in the background 2
needforspeed,3aw546,astain3,1 point,Wed Jun 24 12:41:03 2015 UTC,I think the distancing themselves from underground. But the introduction of the classic songs would be a nice nod to the roots of NFS.

needforspeed,3aw546,trickeh2k,0,Thu Jun 25 01:05:55 2015 UTC,"While it would be cool I wouldn't hope for it and for me personally I wouldn't care at all. Music has never been important to me in a game like this. Only time I feel it's of importance is a game like The Witcher 3 which has a very specific kind of music fitting the game.  GTA: Vice City was another one of those but for any racing game, it's always just generic tracks which you end up getting bored of listening to over and over again.   Also, any kind of music just really matters to console players."
needforspeed,3avjd5,shibewowdoge,2,Tue Jun 23 21:05:33 2015 UTC,"I see no reason why it wouldn't be the same, I mean, it's developed by the same guys who made Rivals."

needforspeed,3ar8zx,snakeaway,2,Tue Jun 23 08:22:47 2015 UTC,Would really like cockpit view. But they have been dodging the manual transmission question for days now.   List of things they should have  Cockpit view  Manual Transmission  Suspension tuning  Lip kits and rear diffusers  Multiple exhaust tips  Highway battle   The more they reveal the less excited I get.
needforspeed,3as0te,NovaWrath,2,Tue Jun 23 01:18:03 2015 UTC,"The last racing game that I played and really enjoyed was Need for Speed Hot Pursuit 2010, and they did really well the DLC. If anything, the most over powered cars for each class were in the original content. Bottom line, you could beat any car with any other car provided that you were good enough with them. It was more a system of car difficulty. I think they'll be okay with DLC here."
needforspeed,3as0te,Davie_Doobie,1 point,Tue Jun 23 20:03:52 2015 UTC,I hope they actually take feedback from old games and implement it into the new one.
needforspeed,3as0te,Davie_Doobie,1 point,Fri Jun 26 02:28:06 2015 UTC,"They already did. Ghost requested the year off to research what the fans really wanted in the next game because they could see the franchise was failing. When they got the feedback they needed they started developing this new title, which is supposed to sit right between Underground and Most Wanted (Original)."
needforspeed,3as0te,Davie_Doobie,1 point,Fri Jun 26 03:33:47 2015 UTC,Including DLC?

needforspeed,3as0te,Lillestoel,2,Fri Jun 26 09:35:47 2015 UTC,I'm worried that they are going to show you rims and mods that are behind a permanent paywall.
needforspeed,3as0te,Allegiance10,2,Wed Jun 24 06:14:30 2015 UTC,"I don't mind DLC, but I really don't want to sit with the feeling that I'm now paying EA money for access to some tiny DLC with a car that I need for the game to be complete. When I buy DLC's from Rockstar or Bethesda, I get the feeling that I'm now paying the devs to gain access to a new portion of the game, which I am happy to do, because the content is worth the money.  10$ for 3 cars? Fuck off...  10$ for 5 new weapons, a new landscape, a new storyline, a trophy list and more armor/skins? Sure!  It's EA, so just kill off your hopes and dreams for a clean and user-friendly game that you feel is built with passion, insight and knowledge about what makes NFS as good as it can possibly be. There will be DLC's or microtransactions, and they will only release this to make as much fucking money as possible with zero fucks to give about how we feel as soon as the game is out. Because they need to get to work on the next NFS."
needforspeed,3as0te,ktfright,2,Thu Jun 25 12:18:25 2015 UTC,"Now see, you've put my feelings into words. Take a look at CD Project Red. 16 Pieces of free DLC, which include missions, armour, weapons and skins. They will be releasing more DLC which will be sent out in two waves. Both waves add hours of new gameplay and weapons and side quests. That's something I will pay for."
needforspeed,3as0te,ktfright,1 point,Fri Jun 26 02:27:10 2015 UTC,Its EA and they are rebooting a franchise. Be prepared for DLC up the butt.

needforspeed,3as0te,ktfright,4,Tue Jun 23 01:44:59 2015 UTC,Dude. EA are money whores as well. FIFA as the prime example. It's actually been proven you get players out of packs by spending money rather than in game currency.

needforspeed,3apvg1,Sheidyn,6,Mon Jun 22 15:17:32 2015 UTC,"+1, I really hope this will run nicely and hope it won't be built around the same system Rivals was, where if you dip under 30/60 the physics break and it becomes a powerpoint presentation"
needforspeed,3apvg1,shibewowdoge,4,Mon Jun 22 15:48:04 2015 UTC,"Let's hope they don't cap the frame rate on PC, like they did with Rivals."
needforspeed,3apvg1,ionp2,1 point,Mon Jun 22 18:01:38 2015 UTC,Also no anti-aliasing and no mouse controls
needforspeed,3apvg1,Metrospector,3,Sun Jun 28 15:53:03 2015 UTC,"I completely agree with you on this one. Every NFS before Rivals could be played with 60 FPS, as any racing game should. It was super disappointing to me when Rivals was locked to 30 because it ran like garbage. Which was crazy because it ran on Frostbite.   What worries me is the cinematic look they are going for with this new reboot. You can see it in the gameplay trailer. And as you know, cinematic = 24-30FPS. I want to like Ghost Games, and I'm hoping the new NFS will be great. What they have shown so far looks super promising. But until they embrace PC, it's going to be hard for me to get on board."
needforspeed,3apvg1,natedagr811,1 point,Tue Jun 23 04:20:55 2015 UTC,"I think they have learned, just like Rockstar Games, it's obvious they have listened to us now, they know that giving the players what they want will have a huge amount of profit and sales, no matter what it costs, so why do it the wrong way?"

needforspeed,3apvg1,trickeh2k,1 point,Mon Jun 22 23:31:26 2015 UTC,Haven't you seen the gameplay from E3? It was in 60fps and most likely from a PC since there where no icons from a PS4 or XB1 present.

I'm pretty sure my rig will be enough but maybe not run it on the highest settings with 60+ fps.  4790k @ 4,6Ghz + EVGA GTX 780 Classified @ 1397Mhz. And no, The Run is NOT running the same engine, neither of these games have. FB2 for The Run, FB3 for Rivals and FB4 for NFS 2015.  The one thing I can't find any info about is if the game engine can utilize DX12, that will be a game changer."
needforspeed,3apvg1,trickeh2k,1 point,Tue Jun 23 12:31:26 2015 UTC,"Yeah i'm aware DICE is not as big as Ghost Games, but Rivals was unplayable for a lot of people, i just hope they know how to handle the engine better this time, i'm sure they learned a lot for the year they spent.  With same engine i ment FrostBite, i know they are different versions, but it should have some kind of same base, but it was another team dev anyway.  I do have an R7 M65 and an i7-4500, i hope is more than enough for the next game (i usually play on low, so i'm not expecting all the ultra stuff)"
needforspeed,3apvg1,MostWanted2011,1 point,Tue Jun 23 12:47:48 2015 UTC,"Well, they obviously didn't spend much time on the PC version of Rivals so it's no surprise that it ran much worse. However, this time around devs are finally letting go of the last gen (thank god) so with just one architecture to focus on we should give the devs more time for each platform.  Hmm, well I know nothing about that video card but a quick googling of it gives me the impression it wont. While the CPU is decent, the GPU is quite crap with today's standards since it was a lower mid-spec range 1½ years ago.  You're better off getting a new computer or pick it up on ps4/xb1 if I'm to guess."

They are too lazy to do cockpits and too lazy to confirm manual but you going tout deep customization. If it's a free roam open world then you should be able to cruise at 60 mph without being in a gear it thinks you should be in.
needforspeed,3aqunp,ThaneDukeHeineken,-6,Wed Jun 24 16:21:36 2015 UTC,Need for speed is the first game I ever played with a cockpit view. I waited years to get improvements to graphics so that cockpit view is standard. Its just not okay they keep giving the car culture a bad name by not including legitimate upgrades for cars. Im so tired of seeing the ugliest combinations of colors on cars in racing games. People are fucking asking about neon lights like are you serious nobody does that. Puddle lights are classy though.
needforspeed,3aqunp,ThaneDukeHeineken,4,Mon Jun 22 21:29:56 2015 UTC,The game not having what you want doesn't mean you can insult other people's tastes. Sure it sucks that there's no cockpit view but it's not like they have infinite resources and time for this game. It might come in an update.

Need for speed Underground 1 and 2 you had manual transmission. If they are not putting these in the game what are they doing? What are they working on? A racing game at its basis is gas, brake, steering, and gear changing. How can EA a big name bring such a lackluster game in the same environment as Pcars Forza and Horizon. And then have the nerve to partner up with speed hunters and not include some very basic features for a racing game."

needforspeed,3aqunp,AwxyMoron,2,Wed Jun 24 14:34:18 2015 UTC,"What have/could they be putting in?  -A handling system that allows both drift cars, grip cars and in between, thus allowing everyone to have the handling they want.  -Getting licensing then modelling new cars  -Getting licensing and modelling aftermarket parts for these cars (Something that has not been in NFS for years and is the most asked for feature. Ghost and Criterion had no prior experience in this before.)  -Organizing the story-lines and getting proper filmed cut-scenes (Again something that has not been done by Ghost/Criterion unless they're in MW 2012)  Don't forget that the start of the creation process was to actually get what people want and try to fit together the pieces into a game for everyone."
needforspeed,3aqunp,ElTiempo832,0,Wed Jun 24 23:37:20 2015 UTC,Handling system- something they are supposed to do.   Licensing- something they have always done  Modeling aftermarket- Something they have done before and with this game style is a given.  Story lines and cut scenes are fluff but needed for those who thoroughly enjoy them. Need for speed underground 2 was on xbox and ps2 etc. and still had options to change engine dressing to subwoofers in your car. They even had dyno tuning and drag racing which you had to have manual. Drag racing was the best on the underground series. Seriously rocket bunny kits but you can't confirm manual. It's bullshit. We deserve a better game for $60 bucks aND plus for DLC. Fucking handling system for drift or grip just give us TCS and stm system and be done with it. I shouldn't have to go through loading screens to drift or grip.(not saying it will happen)

You can't just cruise around without the police chasing you every 5 minutes. I usually don't experience bugs much which is also the case for this and the Crew. If you don't want too much action but you want a game like the recent NFS games, get Hot Pursuit purely because the free roam is police-free.  For your second question, I hope it goes on a 2 year cycle but I think it might return to yearly cycles. I'd much rather Ghost just add to this game over the months rather than make a new game (I'll be very willing to buy DLC for cars, parts, races and map extensions like Big Surf Island or South Central in MCLA)."

The customization is terrible, I don't like the physics at all and the Burnout crash scenes are annoying AF. But if you like the way the gameplay looks, with automatic drifting through corners and crashing out of the map and waiting to respawn, then this is the game for you.  Also the pursuits are bad. The cops drive in pretty much any car in any heat level and they try to kill you. Unlike the good old pursuits with Crown Vics and faster cars in higher heat levels."
needforspeed,3anlmm,trickeh2k,1 point,Mon Jun 22 08:13:21 2015 UTC,"No, I wouldn't recommend Rivals to anyone. It's the worst NFS ever after The Run. The game uses an always connected feature and P2P connection which makes the game extremely broken.  Because of this poor choice of P2P, and the system used to play against/with others, there's no multiplayer at all in this game. You're free to chase people lagging and take them out either as a cop or racer of course but if you enjoy racing on tracks against other people then you can throw this game out of the window.  The Crew has a lot but that game is a PoS as well but at least it works better than Rivals."
needforspeed,3anlmm,Davie_Doobie,1 point,Tue Jun 23 14:21:37 2015 UTC,"The game itself looked great, and it ran well on the PS4. I had it for PS3 and it was terrible, everything was really choppy. The thing that made the actual game bad was the open-world and seamless online integration. Open world lobbies ruin any and all competition, couple that with a massive map that could only host 8 racers and now your problem isn't only finding competition, it's finding people period. I wouldn't recommend wasting the money. If anything buy it at GameStop used because you can return it for all your money back within 7 days, but ask to make sure that they'll do that because policies may be different where you come from. Good luck!   P.S. Sorry to hear you had to experience The Crew, I didn't even make it past the tutorial before I returned it."

I bought it and i do not recommend it, to sum it up i rather play The Run than than this, at least is playable, and the most optimized NFS game so far.  I'm still sticked to HP 2010 but no one even plays it, soo.  If you are getting it on console tho, is a nice game, but not awesome, basically because it's hard to get a nice game with people, i'ts pretty much vs AI since most of the people do not bother playing, so i recommend it only with friends."

I've heard great things about the early games in the franchise, but I can't vote for them - I've never played pre-UG, and if I gave them a go they're probably to outdated for me to appreciate their quality for their time."

needforspeed,3aiyqv,Davie_Doobie,1 point,Sat Jun 20 20:18:15 2015 UTC,Agreed. I thought you meant big a$$ Escalades and Hummer type of SUV's. But an F-150 Raptor with some kind of playground would be nice.

needforspeed,3aitw9,Malvu5,3,Sat Jun 20 16:41:27 2015 UTC,"I pray they optimize this well... and of course, 60fps..."
needforspeed,3aitw9,shibewowdoge,1 point,Sat Jun 20 17:08:01 2015 UTC,"When was the last time when games published by EA had bad optimization? They're not Ubi to give us an unoptimised game. And I remember them saying something about the 30FPS cap, and that they'll do something about it. +They have/had much more time to polish the performance part(@2 years and only 3 platforms)."
needforspeed,3aitw9,Kaennox,2,Sat Jun 20 20:17:41 2015 UTC,"Rivals was horribly optimized. They never did anything about the 30fps cap on that, it was the community/modders that got around it.   Yes, that's why I hope it runs well on all systems"
needforspeed,3aitw9,shibewowdoge,1 point,Sat Jun 20 20:28:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Rivals annoyed me aswell,but they had to optimise it for PS3, PS4, xBox 360, xBox One and PC. And I know they haven't done anything about the 30FPS cap, but they said that in the future they will do something about it, and I hope they were talking about this Need For Speed.  But still, looking at those graphics, it's hard to believe that it will work on older systems, or newer/-ish low end like mine(i3-3220 4GB RAM with R7 250 1GB).  EDIT: I am kind of defending them, but that's pretty much it. Hopefully they care about us : the ones with crappy PC's."
needforspeed,3aitw9,Kaennox,3,Sat Jun 20 20:39:20 2015 UTC,"Let's hope so, I'm confident they'll be giving us 60fps - I remember hearing something like that as well. In fact, I think it might have been indirectly and discreetly confirmed it. I just spent ages trying to find the tweet but can't (deleted?), it was basically a fan asking if PC will be 60fps and the main frostbite dev or whoever replied ""sorry we can't reveal that info yet"" (no surprise there) and the fan replies ""all you have to do is wink ;)"" and the dev replies with ""that's a very creaive idea ;)"" and that was that. Paraphrasing of course, but there we are.   I think you'll actually be fine if they include proper graphics settings and options, tbh again Rivals lacked in that area. There is no excuse for a modern day AAA title to not include Anti-Aliasing options! I hear the E3 demo was running at 30fps at 1080p on the PS4, which is actually not bad, at least it's native res. If you can upgrade your GPU to like an R9 270 or 270X or something you'd pretty much be guaranteed that (30 @ 1080).  Hell, I have an R9 280 and I am worried lol. I'd like to max it out bar the usual things like AA etc and still run smooth 60 @ 1080, kills me waiting for system requirements just to get an idea on if this is possible lol"
needforspeed,3aitw9,shibewowdoge,0,Sun Jun 21 13:47:15 2015 UTC,The YouTube video of the gameplay is running @60fps so you would suppose it will.

needforspeed,3aitw9,RavenwestR1,1 point,Sun Jun 21 22:57:10 2015 UTC,"Well, it depends. I really don't think you'll have any trouble running the game. Atleast on low-medium, but we can only hope for good optimisation."
needforspeed,3aitw9,Kaennox,0,Mon Jun 22 10:44:23 2015 UTC,Or why not 120/144 fps :O  It makes everything just so much smoother and with DX12 I would see it very possible to run the game in those frames even with a decent pc.
needforspeed,3aitw9,Kirasath,1 point,Sat Jun 20 19:32:25 2015 UTC,Unless you have a beast of a PC 120/144 is going to be a dream for now.
needforspeed,3aitw9,shibewowdoge,1 point,Sat Jun 20 19:53:09 2015 UTC,"I think there's two ways to look at this. Dx12 brings a lot better lightning to the games, the way the computer handles it and in nocturnal games there's a lot of light sources that play a big role but should with help of dx12/mantle be minimized.  For me this is not a problem in terms of computing power but it would be awesome if everyone could enjoy the game to it's full potential, however 60fps is enough and anything above is a nice bonus =)"

needforspeed,3ahln6,dumbelts,0,Sun Jun 28 01:59:18 2015 UTC,"what scares me is not the lack of internal cam but his inability - not knowing how - to compare the map to NFS U2. if they are saying many times that they are trying to get back to the roots of NFS and teh core gameplay and ""going back to see what the game was about, what made it great"" it isn't convincing when he hasn't played the best game in the series!"
needforspeed,3ahln6,designsbyghost,7,Sat Jun 20 15:12:38 2015 UTC,"How do you expect him to find out how big the map is? Developers only give stats on map size versus old games because they have the actually units in code that they can measure.   With Rivals they made a jump to the frostbite engine, so it is very easy for him to find out map size between rivals and nfs2015, but you are expecting him to somehow find out how big a map is compared to a game that is 10+ years old.   If you think its so easy to guesstimate the size of maps, why don't you just compare U2 to rivals in order to get the real size of NFS2015?"
needforspeed,3ahln6,flipperkip97,1 point,Sat Jun 20 18:21:17 2015 UTC,"Didn't they start using Frostbite with The Run? I absolutely KNOW The Run uses Frostbite, does MW2012 not?"
needforspeed,3ahln6,crawlerz2468,3,Sun Jun 21 22:53:46 2015 UTC,"I'm sure he's played it, but being part of a team that didn't work on Underground 2 I can see how he can't compare. Rivals is the most recent game in the series, one that he's worked on so I'm sure he knows the map like the back of his hand. Where as NFSU2, he's probably like a lot of people including myself, who played it, but can't think of a map to compare it too, I played the everlasting shit out of that game but it's been so long, could be the case with him! You shouldn't be worried, the gameplay I feel is more than enough to ensure us how great it's going to be!"
needforspeed,3ahln6,flipperkip97,2,Sat Jun 20 16:14:26 2015 UTC,"But they asked the fans on Facebook what their favourite NFS was and why, so they definitely know what makes NFS games so awesome!"

needforspeed,3ahln6,flipperkip97,1 point,Sat Jun 20 17:03:05 2015 UTC,"Nope, no sarcasm. They posted a lot of (mostly) UG/MW/Carbon pictures and asked what fans liked the most about them and responded to comments."
needforspeed,3ahhg0,AjBlue7,4,Sat Jun 20 05:42:10 2015 UTC,"Agree completely! I like to consider it the 'RPG' of racing games, there was context and ambiance and development that most of the genre lacked.  Having the different shops (and in MW/C the Safehouses as well) and areas gave motivation to explore and made you feel a part of the world as opposed to just being a backdrop for racing. Open world racing maps aren't highly interactive like in a conventional open-world game, so interactive and purposeful building's and landmarks made the world come alive. I hope the shops/car lots/safehouses are back. You can weave places of interest into the story as well which would be awesome.  You nailed the unique experience bit, I don't need to elaborate on that.  I think it was right to 'reboot' the series like this... for me, Need for Speed lost its' identity, they were doing something new every year and while some of the games had fundamentally sound mechanics, it just felt generic.  I think they've finally found what the people want and discovered their niche and the racing genre. There are quality titles in the racing market, but no ones doing this. The 'street' scene if you will is a unique vibe and with it, unique game-play, and I think it's what they should stick with. So pumped for this years game!"
needforspeed,3ahhg0,houbsurf,1 point,Sat Jun 20 06:37:52 2015 UTC,"I can see daytime having a use in an NFS game other than racing. I'd suggest expanding the phone system which seems to be in this upcoming NFS and using it like a menu, as it is for GTA 5. Except in NFS you can organise races for that night. I'm sure this isn't something that everyone will like but to me it makes the RPG aspects deeper."

Also, both Ken Block and Vaughn Gittin Jr. do drifting, so I don't know how are they going to get them both in the game. Anyway, the 2nd left silhouette looks like Ken Block. Not sure about the far right one, I always saw Vaughn wearing a cap so I don't know what haircut he has or head shape to tell exactly. Although it would make perfect sense for him to be in the game because that grey Mustang in the trailer/gameplay looks exactly like his RTR spec 5(You'll find it on SpeedHunters).

needforspeed,3acm67,trickeh2k,1 point,Wed Jun 24 17:33:50 2015 UTC,"Car games are kind of an exception to the rule. They can really crank up the graphics because they don't have a lot of things that other games have which take up a lot of power. In NFS's case it looks like they are saving a lot of time and energy by having the people be real time cutscenes, instead of having to model and animate characters."

needforspeed,3acm67,alexharveyuk,1 point,Tue Jun 23 14:36:44 2015 UTC,I will pre-order. I won't care the tiniest bit if the graphics get downgraded a bit. Rivals' graphics on 360 are fine and it will probably be even a little better than that.

The reason I say we also can do break caliper colors is that in the previous videos shown, the BRZ had black Brembo Calipers, here they are red Brembo Calipers. Plus lets be real, if we can change the rotor color, caliper is a no brainier anyways.  But this makes me really excited for the detailed customization. I can't confirm, but does anyone know about rim sizes being an option anywhere? Probably under the little wrench section past the secondary color section on the wheels..."

needforspeed,3abb16,astain3,1 point,Thu Jun 18 20:33:57 2015 UTC,you know that the car belongs to ford?  Gittin always drives ford cars even has done comercials for ford fiesta before. Is the same as ken block used to drive epic subarus but the cars were never his. Same with current ken blocks hoonicorn rtr ( the old mustang) ford makes those cars to make flashy videos and make people interested in those models of the cars because they are one of a kind. Also Gittin is a pro racer he has nothing to do with hoonigan. Ken block is a pro racer but he has this whole image of a showboater hooligan (Hoonigan) thats why he fits in the game. if you remember of one of the 5 gameplay styles is STYLE and kenblock represents that. Also speedhunters did a report (presentation) of the car on their website did a photoshoot etc. and Remember speedhunters are responsible for picking out cars giving reference of car culture to the devs.
needforspeed,3abb16,ShiroQ,1 point,Thu Jun 18 21:06:40 2015 UTC,"I dont think you understand.  RTR as a company belongs to Vaughn Gittin Jr. Its his company. They are releasing tuning kits for the new Mustang GT, and the RTR Spec 5 is his companys creating for him to drift with in competitions.  Ken Block has nothing to do with RTR. Hes part of Hoonigan, yes, but thats about it.   So I can assume that the RTR Spec 5 displayed is his. If he made the car, I doubt hed be happy to let other people get asosiated to it trough videogames.  I mean, you cant even buy that Widebody kit for the MustangGT. Its his own thing."

It penalizes you for crashing into things, so threading the needle and getting near-misses is much more rewarding. I think its weird when crashing into a car in the oncoming lane at 200+mph doesn't result in an insane crashing animation."
needforspeed,3aadd3,Gumball_Machine,0,Thu Jun 18 15:21:03 2015 UTC,"But it's not only at 200+ mph. And the speed you can through drive a corner with is also ""weird"" in NFS games, but that doesn't matter."
needforspeed,3aadd3,AjBlue7,1 point,Thu Jun 18 15:32:27 2015 UTC,"The only reason the newer NFS games had the cinematic crashing and whatnot was because Criterion made them. If you look at the Burnout series, say, Paradise for example, and compare it to the newest Most Wanted, it is more or less the same game. It's weird how much of Burnout they let creep into their NFS games. I think we probably won't see cinematic crashing, but rather a more arcade bouncing collision, where you sort of brush past and bump around rather than explode into a billion pieces."
needforspeed,3a7ymg,einjzmolf,10,Wed Jun 17 22:58:46 2015 UTC,Makes me wonder how far they really are taking the handling customization.  Why don't they just make a video about it to put peoples worries to rest?

I like that you can set your car up for grip/drift. I love the idea that it could make you have dedicated cars for different setups/events. But if neither options are well implemented, it's a waste.  I love regular 'grip' racing, but let's not harp on that because we're clearly looking at a 'drift' setup here and in the E3 video. Drifting is one of my favourite race types, play it in every NFS game, but this flat out doesn't look fun - it's just an awkward power slide every time you turn even the slightest. The UG2 drift mode was good, if a bit slow in pace, albeit mostly in closed off circuits (though there were the downhill hill drifts). The Carbon drift mode was on closed circuits or down the canyons - had a great sense of speed and good handling.  To incorporate a 'drift' (aka forced power slide in this case) mode into the open world, especially with what looks like crappy handling, is really disappointing."

needforspeed,3a6yu1,Mach-O_Tac-O,1 point,Wed Jun 17 21:36:03 2015 UTC,I also watched the rev counter for the video and I also think it looked like it was manual as I'm pretty sure I saw the car hitting the max revs for a couple of seconds when it was not the highest gear. It's a hard thing to try to work so I guess we can wait and see if there's an announcement about it or watch future game-play videos.

needforspeed,3a3g9f,ColonelSquirrel,0,Wed Jun 17 05:24:49 2015 UTC,if you find a brz/gt86 that us customized with rocketbunny and has quite a lot money spent on it and has no turbo then i will salute you. turbos are like the first things people put in japanese cars if they dont have one.
needforspeed,3a3g9f,ShiroQ,1 point,Tue Jun 16 23:22:26 2015 UTC,"Well in the video you saw him take a stock BRZ, then put paint, wheels and a kit on it and go drive and then bam it was turbo.  Now don't get me wrong, I'm strongly assuming that was done behind the scenes and its just a turbo kit and we have nothing to worry about,  but there are other bigger games that just have added bov sounds to random cars so I'm just a little hesitant. Edit - Also I know of a handful of rocket bunny BRZ/FRS's that aren't turbo, some of which are V8 swapped :P"
needforspeed,3a3g9f,halycon8,2,Tue Jun 16 23:42:24 2015 UTC,still japanese aka tuner cars always go with a turbo. in almost every nfs game where you had performance customisation you would put in the turbo and then the bov sound would come. I really doubt they would add a bov sound just for fun in this game
needforspeed,3a3g9f,ShiroQ,1 point,Wed Jun 17 00:35:59 2015 UTC,Does a stock Subaru really sound like that? The car had nitrous and we don't know if that is its own part like in the earlier NFS titles.
needforspeed,3a3g9f,astain3,1 point,Wed Jun 17 04:26:20 2015 UTC,no that didn't sound at all like a stock BRZ (which doesn't really sound like any other Subaru anyway) but with exhaust and boost yeah a real BRZ could absolutely sound like the game.  Also nitrous doesn't change the sound of a car which I think you were implying?  If not no worries
needforspeed,3a3g9f,halycon8,1 point,Wed Jun 17 04:30:24 2015 UTC,Not about the sound but it might prove that there may have been modifications to the engine.

needforspeed,39zyrq,l3mon_aid,27,Tue Jun 16 03:45:22 2015 UTC,"This is where the frustration stems from: Ghost did something unheard of. They took a year off, listened to fans, brought back customization, performance tuning, a nocturnal open world and pretty much everything people have been asking for. Yet despite designing what looks like the perfect NFS, the handing model appears to be complete shit. This game can have the best story, customization, tuning, graphics, etc but it simply doesn't matter if cars handle more like boats than cars. Yes, it was a drift event, but once the drift event ended a pursuit began and the same physics remained. The same physics were also shown in every cutscene and in the other trailer. It's just so disheartening to finally get the NFS we've wanted for so long, and have the most important part of the game, the actual driving, be so terrible. We're not asking for simulation physics, we're simply asking for physics that make sense. Easily drifting with the press of a button around every corner in every car is the fastest way to race? There is absolutely no sense in that. And most importantly, zero enjoyment.   EDIT: There's an Instagram photo (https://instagram.com/p/4ATTBKSyGW/) that shows a tuning option to turn off ""brake drift."" It's not confirmed what that exactly means, but it definitely looks promising.  Hopefully you can race just as fast with ""brake drift"" turned off."

Yes you can adjust handling characteristics of the car to make it ""grippier"" but it will still be running on the same shitty handling engine where drifting is always the fastest way around the course.  Think of the Ariel Atom in NFS Most Wanted 2012. Super ""grippy"" high downforce lightweight vehicle, but drifting it around corners is the fastest way to race. This is most likely how adjusting your handling will be. Yes you can make your car have more grip, but you will still drift nearly every corner. I wish they would just outright say this instead of trying to trick people but whatever.

The hand brake is a way to initiate a drift, cars must be set up to drift. Turning is possible as you see in the gameplay. It's not Forza drifting, it's in the middle of NFS The Run and Forza drifting. Under your control, but it's no sim.  As for the camera, that's new to me.

Trust me, I hope I'm dead ass wrong, but Black Panther has always pretty much sucked EA's dick in every video he's ever posted. That's why EA chose him to be the Youtuber that got to visit Ghost's studio.  Look at his wording. The handbrake is ""a"" way to initiate a drift. This means normally applying the brakes could also initiate a drift. I know a lot of you think I'm being really nit picky and negative but I'm just being realistic and analytical. I hope I'm 100% wrong about the handling, but everything I've seen has pointed to a shit handling system.  The rest of the game looks fantastic."

If it's completely unrealistic, it typically becomes a sailboat game, not a car game. I've noticed myself that my favorite racing game yet on PS4, is GTA V of all games... It doesn't have simulator physics, but the racing is fun and believable. Arcadish and fast, sure, but turning, grip, handling and vehicle damage is believable and makes it fun. TBH, fuck Driveclub and Forza... I keep buying them hoping that eventually something good has to come along, but it never does, neither has it in the NFS franchise for a very long time now... Damn, rant over lol =P"

That said, I think a lot of these 'angry' comments were pretty reactionary and people realized later on.  Massive credit to Ghost Games for what's looking like a great title, and kudos for listening to the community and treating it with the love and respect it deserves, but that doesn't mean we have to be blinded fan-boys and not critique things. The online only was a poor development decision, and the driving physics is hard to tell because of the dynamic camera used but I have my early concerns from watching it. Otherwise, things are looking awesome!"
needforspeed,39zyrq,houbsurf,1 point,Tue Jun 16 10:05:09 2015 UTC,"I actually like to think that the always online stuff was forced by EA. Since HotPursuit(2010), NFS got pushed more and more towards the online zone of gaming, from a simple Autolog profile to an entire network of interconnected maps and players (Rivals). So I doubt the developers, regardless of who they were had anything to say about it.  And you're right about the physics, the moving camera made it hard to understand what was actually happening in a certain corner. But if you remember Carbon, when we got to install the tires, we had a GRIP - DRIFT slider, where we could choose by our own liking how the car should behave in a corner. Well, I just visited the official site and I found this:   'Finish it up with personalized car handling, ensuring your car handles exactly how you want. Want a more drift-focused ride? No problem. More grip? You can do that too.'  So I guess they're going to use a similar concept."
needforspeed,39zyrq,houbsurf,1 point,Tue Jun 16 10:47:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it may well be an EA thing, but either way, it was disappointing (not that it really effects me unless they shut down the servers at any point).  As for the handling, I think I agree with N0Fear88 - being able to adjust the handling of your ride doesn't mean the driving physics might be outright bad. We'll have to wait and see on that one."

However I have to admit that I'm going to be a little skeptical about Need for Speed until I play it and experience it for myself. I've just been let down too many times in the past. As far as what you've said about everything else though, thats just people. People are never satisfied with anything. I heard some jackass on the GTAV sub saying that Rockstar needed to start changing the map because it's already been two years and nothing has changed. It's like he doesn't understand that they gave away almost 10 DLC packs completely free, massive DLC packs completely FREE. Everybody wants a game that is personalized to every one of their personal preferences, they don't understand that Ghost has to create a happy-medium between tens of thousands of people."

Rivals was sorry.  I don't know how to say it any more eloquently.  Like Carbon, it was way too short.  Like Carbon, it had nothing to offer once you completed the game.  Like Carbon, it suffered from a half-assed physics system and a tier ranking system for cars that made no sense whatsoever.  Add to that the obnoxiously intrusive always-online stuff (that could at least be turned off) and the fact that, supposedly, the same people who made HP 2010 and MW 2012 also turned this half-baked crap in and...well, I don't have a lot of hope for this.  Which is sad, because I have been a fan of the Need for Speed series for so long.  Hell, Most Wanted 2005 is one of the few games I have enthusiastically played and beat multiple times across multiple platforms.  But with the exception of Criterion Games' efforts, nothing the franchise has done has been noteworthy or even good since Black Box screwed the pooch hard with Carbon in 2006.  Everyone complains about Hot Pursuit 2010 and Most Wanted 2012 being Burnout clones - thing is, those two were some of the most fun I've had with Need for Speed in the last ten years.  Relatively no-frills, no muss, no fuss.  Here's your fast cars.  Go.  If I want to customize shit, I'll jump on Forza...which, frankly, has done what everyone else seems to be failing at right now.  Playground Games has their shit together.  Turn 10 has their shit together.  EA and their devs most definitely do not have their shit together - and on the off chance that one or both of them do get it together, look for one party or the other to completely screw it up."

Ken Block now runs Hoonigan, he is probably best known for his Gymkhana videos, but also competes in WRC, Rally America, and would be associated with Ford and RTR.  He would be in the RTR Mustang. Associated with the Style segment, according to the trailers framing.   Akira Nakai runs Rauh-Welt Begriff, a Porsche shop in Japan. He's associated with the Build segment. He's also a super cool guy. I've had the pleasure of meeting him a few times and it'll be neat to see him in game.   Magnus Walker runs American Outlaw, is a fashion designer and vintage Porsche enthusiast. He seems to be the head of the Soeed Segment.   Mark Arcenal runs Fatlace/Illest/Hellaflush. His Hakosuka is shown during the Outlaw segment. That combined with those sneakers make it hard for me to think of anyone else it could be."

The fact that they are working so closely with Speedhunters shows in customization as well. They have Rocket Bunny kits, RWB, Liberty Walk and eveything else what was featured on Speedhunters. This is pretty much Speedhunters: The Game. They're all cool guys so it should be very interesting to see how they fit in the story. Seems the story revolves around getting their attention and maybe racing/competing against them somehow. Like In the previous NFS, they could act like the bosses of each segment (Speed, Style, Build, Crew and Outlaw). This is the best way they could have done a NFS game as well since if they would have listened to every knob head wanting another U3 we'd have gotten ricers everywhere.

Secondly they're avoiding my questions about support for it on both Twitter and Facebook, so I guess that they've just decided that if they don't have a cockpit camera then there's no reason to invest both money and time for a driving wheel support.  I might be wrong tough..."
needforspeed,3a1mef,EpicallyBoss,1 point,Tue Jun 16 17:03:00 2015 UTC,"They are not answering anyone's questions, at least not those with substance.   As a software developer I can grasp the need to not make share info too soon, let alone what the Marketing dept decides to release.  (It can get complicated)  As for the time it takes to write the wheel code, one could also make the suggestion that since they are not taking the time to deal with cockpit view that they now have the time to deal with the Wheel code, which since the game engine is in use by other racing games that do support wheel is likely to be minimal.   But I could be wrong.  I think it can be best to wait until official word comes down before we praise or complain about something.  Guess work is just too much pain"

The amount of drift in this trailer is too much doh, if you had 200 km/h and instantly turned it 90 degrees, the car wouldnt turn, just slide away in the same direction you where driving in the first place, when hot pursuit reboot introduces this auto slide funcion, the game kinda died for me  (Oh there is a tight corner ahead, lets just press x and keep 300 mph through the entire corner, works everytime, what is brakes)"

It'll be awesome to create a ride and see it come to life in the game like that, incredible.  Customization seems good, though they didn't really reveal much... covered pretty basic visual options though hopefully there's a lot more that wasn't shown. I feel like the menu's could've been more intuitive - with the rims, for instance, it's hard to 'decide' on an option when you're cycling through them 1 by 1 like that... I'd prefer a list or a grid with a thumbnail.  I was interested in seeing the whole 'narrative' thing, it definitely needs it, but it was characteristically corny for me. Going back to the first person live action cut-scenes isn't my preference, but I can understand the nostalgia of it and why some people prefer it.  As for the game-play... well, I'll try not to be too reactionary after one video, but the driving looks horrible. Maybe it's just the dynamic camera, but it seems like it might be the driving physics itself as well. Fingers crossed it was just the (optional) camera.  I want to love this so bad.  Edit: I see that was a 'drift' setup, good to know but I'm still iffy on the physics. Will have to see with a static camera to set my mind at ease. I love drift mode and that didn't look like fun. Hope with a static camera the physics are more like UG-Carbon."

needforspeed,39zcb2,StxrStruck,1 point,Tue Jun 16 12:36:13 2015 UTC,"Shape of the head and chin and so on fit Ken Block more than Vaughn Gittin. Plus, Ken Block does the Gymkhana series and is the CEO of HOONIGAN so if there's anyone to represent Style it would be him. Every character represents one of the 5 style in the game (Speed, Style, Build, Crew and Outlaw). Ken Block is the ultimate choice for Style. Last Gymkhana that he did was in Los Angeles which is what Ventura Bay is based on, the new city we'll get to race in during Need for Speed 2015. Plus, you can see HOONIGAN decals on the red BRZ and Ken Block also has a Need for Speed No Limits decal on his car https://www.hoonigan.com/media/hoonigan/cms/GYM7_Web__007_Wall.jpg"
needforspeed,39zcb2,Malvu5,1 point,Sun Jun 21 12:50:34 2015 UTC,"Very very true. All I wanted to do was produce the notion that it might now be Block. If it were to be Block however, would there be some kind of Gymkhana in the new NFS? I only say that because in the gameplays, we've seen a ton of ""press X to drift"" type drifting but we haven't seen much driving that is influenced by Gymkhana (referencing Undercover's 360 and 180 spins etc). Perhaps the devs are holding out on showing Gymkhana until we get closer to release."
needforspeed,39zcb2,StxrStruck,2,Sun Jun 21 13:50:50 2015 UTC,"Dirt 2 and 3 had Gymkhana-style arenas where you could drift around using Ken Block's rally Fiesta. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvqmNVjFM30 Besides, even if Vaughn's Mustang is in the game, it doesn't mean he'll make an appearance. Most of the cars shown have been featured on Speedhunters at one point and that's the main inspiration for Need for Speed's customization. I doubt there will be a Gymkhana event in the new NFS but we did see a picture of one of the canyons in the game which is what I suspect will make up the ultimate Style challenge for that part of the game. Here's a picture of it. http://content.pulse.ea.com/content/c-need-for-speed/en_US/news/ventura-bay/jcr:content/body/image_1.img.jpg  Seems the main goal of the game is to attract each of the 5 character's attention somehow and challenge/race them to become the best or something along those lines. I suspect the canyons will play a big part during the Style events since, at least from that one picture it looks like we'll need to drift around most of them considering they are all tight curves. I'm sure there will be a type of race assigned to each style. Like Drag for Speed, Drift for Style, Multiplayer PvP and Story for Crew and messing around with the cops for Outlaw. Build will probably be measured like in Underground 2 with a style meter or something I guess? Or maybe there will be some sort of events where you have to show off or something, I dunno exactly.   I'm hoping they'll do an open beta before release so everyone gets a chance to try out the game since a closed beta is super tricky to get into, not many people get to try out the game and give some feedback and assholes will inevitably try to sell beta keys or scam people with them if there is a closed beta. Besides, I doubt their servers couldn't handle it. They had betas for Battlefield 3, 4 and Hardline along with Titanfall as well and tons of people played them without the servers catching on fire. Should be the same for Need for Speed, though I'd rather have it playable offline as well. Heard that it will be online only like The Crew and we all know how hard that bombed. I'd rather burn my money than spend it on a game I can't play 5-10 years from now or if I don't have an internet connection."
needforspeed,39zcb2,Malvu5,1 point,Sun Jun 21 16:21:19 2015 UTC,Totally agree on that. I love that the devs at NFS are finally listening to the fans who want the game to go back to its roots. But those driving physics to me just looked way too cheesy. Hopefully with a beta we can give feedback about that directly to the devs. It means nothing if the team gets everything else right but totally botch the driving physics. This is a driving game after all.
needforspeed,39zcb2,StxrStruck,1 point,Sun Jun 21 18:29:29 2015 UTC,"You can change the handling however you want.  http://i.imgur.com/UlwnI1X.jpg  From the gameplay, I also saw that it looked more like a combination of Criterion handling and Carbon handling. But you can most likely change it to the point where it handles exactly how you want."

needforspeed,39ngjw,dovahbe4r,1 point,Sat Jun 13 05:11:45 2015 UTC,"Most online games consider modding as cheating or hacking because it can give players unfair advantages. From what we know so far, NFS will be online only. It sucks."
needforspeed,39ngjw,DanzaBaio,2,Sat Jun 13 05:13:44 2015 UTC,"For anyone interested, I believe this, ToCA Edit, is what OP is referring to. It lets you move the camera inside the car, where it was already modeled/detailed so you can see the dash, steering wheel, drivers arms/hands.   Why would they have modeled/rendered all that if not to have a cockpit view? At least someone was able to move the camera.   Without the confirmation that there's no cockpit view in the new game, will the inside of the car be empty? I mean, Hot Pursuit had a camera mod that let you see inside the cockpit, same with Most Wanted, and The Run (all tools by the same guy apparently). It looked like all 3 had interiors set up so that a cockpit view would make sense, or at least maybe they had possibly planned it but scrapped it.   Sadly nothing came out for Rivals. And I can't find a download for the Hot Pursuit mod."

needforspeed,38892g,hoggzwow,1 point,Thu Jun 4 17:38:02 2015 UTC,"They will put a lot of ""customization"" just for buying only. Maybe the game will have 2 currency, if not, they will just put a shop in game to buy more and more customization for your car with real money."
needforspeed,384mq0,INFsleeper,5,Mon Jun 1 20:40:44 2015 UTC,"Driving physics like Horizon 2 would be perfect. It's pretty much like older NFS games. I didn't like Rivals' physics, because when you went into a corner you could just press the brake button once and you could drift through the whole corner perfectly with 200+ kph."
needforspeed,384mq0,flipperkip97,-1,Mon Jun 1 22:31:00 2015 UTC,That's powersliding :)
needforspeed,384mq0,DR1V3R177,1 point,Tue Jun 2 12:01:51 2015 UTC,"Wouldn't a powerslide be where the rear-wheels are locked and the cars momentum be the driving force behind the slide (like a rally car), while a drift is powered by the wheels and is more controlled? Also isn't a powerslide initiated in the middle of a turn while a drift is initiated before the turn? So wouldn't the sliding in Rivals/Most wanted 2012 be drifting by all technicality?"
needforspeed,384mq0,Ryoneftw,6,Tue Jun 2 15:33:44 2015 UTC,"I haven't played yet, but yes, driving physics should be like Forza Horizon 2."
needforspeed,384mq0,sniperwhg,3,Mon Jun 1 21:42:37 2015 UTC,None of that dumbass miles of tire spinning at 200mph either. I like the grippyness of Grid Autosport
needforspeed,384mq0,houbsurf,3,Tue Jun 2 03:33:08 2015 UTC,"Don't know whether they include it but it's heaps of fun and a nice change of pace from the different variations of 'racers' you do.  If they do it, they'll need to do it well, I haven't played Horizon 2 but you guys are making it sound like it's the benchmark. Let's hope they do it and do it justice! I'd always choose the contracts with the most drift races in UG2."
needforspeed,384mq0,iguelmay,1 point,Tue Jun 2 10:08:24 2015 UTC,"I'm just gonna throw my 2 cents in and say I love the ""powersliding"" as you call it from the previous NFS games. Its wild and its fast, and it takes a surprising amount of practice to go into a corner at full speed and drift it between a pedestrian car on the right and a cop car coming at you in the oncoming lane.  I've played forza 2, and while I enjoyed it I hated having to spend time to tune my cars to handle the way I want."

needforspeed,3828hk,Davie_Doobie,12,Mon Jun 1 09:28:21 2015 UTC,"I'm not expecting much until I see some gameplay. But this required internet connection bullshit is not a good sign.  And yes, I've hooked up NFSU 2 to my steering wheel recently and I'm still having a blast with it after all these years. It's not nostalgia, I honestly believe no NFS after that was nearly as good.

needforspeed,3828hk,LegendPT,5,Mon Jun 1 12:29:12 2015 UTC,"In my opinion, the first Most Wanted is where the quality went down hill. Then I feel like they revived that game a bit with Hot Pursuit 2010. Now HP2010 is my favorite. Everything else has just been a shit show."
needforspeed,3828hk,LegendPT,5,Mon Jun 1 18:06:00 2015 UTC,"True, NFSU 2 will always be my favourite but the first Most Wanted was great too. Even Carbon was quite fun imo.  Then came Pro Street. shivers"

That's my only complaint really, I kinda remember it having some good ideas and the graphics were pretty good, but it just wasn't fun to play, personally."
needforspeed,3828hk,DJ_Lud,2,Sun Jun 7 18:11:53 2015 UTC,HP 2010 was some boring stuff. The first Most Wanted is one of the biggest fan favourites! All comes down to personal opinion i suppose. As for this new NFS. I make no judgements until I see ACTUAL gameplay!
needforspeed,3828hk,TriniPsycho,2,Mon Jun 1 22:19:06 2015 UTC,"I was extremely optimistic when they announced the new game with more customization from speedhunters n whatnot, that's until they mentioned the internet thing then my hopes just crashed and burned. I wouldn't feel so negative about it if I wasn't constantly thinking it would be unplayable if I wanted to play it in 8 years especially if it's as good as they're making it out to be."
needforspeed,3828hk,Namsayin,0,Mon Jun 1 15:34:04 2015 UTC,"I didn't know they had made it out to be so good at this point. I only know there is a new Need for Speed with Underground Roots and mandatory online connection. Developers don't make good games anymore, they just make great trailers to pull initial sales."
needforspeed,3828hk,Purplegill10,3,Mon Jun 1 18:01:13 2015 UTC,Do yourself a favor and play the old NFS games so you don't judge the new game too harshly.  You may be blinded by nostalgia.
needforspeed,3828hk,flipperkip97,2,Mon Jun 1 10:47:56 2015 UTC,"You might be right about that, but I have no way to play the old ones. To be honest I've been blinded to any racing game that isn't Hot Pursuit 2010. My Diablo alone in HP2010 has more miles than any of my real cars, and thats just the Diablo. I want this game to be incredible, I really do. I've been in need of a racing game that'll take the place of Hot Pursuit."
needforspeed,3828hk,flipperkip97,1 point,Mon Jun 1 18:09:18 2015 UTC,Honestly I've been playing carbon recently and it hasn't aged a day in my opinion. I've had a few of my friends' younger siblings play the older games and they beyond loved them. Moreso than the newer ones.
needforspeed,3828hk,petesanchez99,2,Tue Jun 2 02:27:54 2015 UTC,"What are you skeptical about?  We are getting rich customization, good old cop chases, night time only and tuner cars (not only Lambos and shit). Now we just need no Burnout-crash-scenes and we're good."

needforspeed,3828hk,screenassert,3,Mon Jun 1 18:04:11 2015 UTC,Just from the trailer and their twitter. There's a custom body kit on (almost) every car in the trailer and there are Ford Crown Vic cop cars. We'll have to wait for E3 to get any more details.
needforspeed,3828hk,JustRefleX,2,Mon Jun 1 19:06:50 2015 UTC,"The Run had custom body kits and rims too, but you could only choose from 5 or so presets...I think thats what he was talking about"

needforspeed,381y0m,Davie_Doobie,2,Mon Jun 1 08:42:06 2015 UTC,Thanks~!
needforspeed,381y0m,Davie_Doobie,2,Mon Jun 1 08:52:26 2015 UTC,"1.) Detailed is not a term I would use to define the tuning in any NFS game.  2.)I don't think they've released anything other than the cars from the 30 second trailer.   3.) It's a Need for Speed title. If you're looking for ""realistic"", you're looking at the wrong franchise. Go play a simulator if you want realistic."

They've crucified one of my favorite game franchises. They way people are with Call of Duty, I was with Need for Speed. I was always so stoked to hear about something new coming along with Need for Speed. Now whenever they start talking about something new I feel like I'm walking into a trap."

I don't want to feel sad over a NFS anymore. You know what else I would like? You might hate me for this, but I don't want anymore free-roam, meet-up, games. The second you make a game free-roam, you ruin the competition. They should introduce a lobby system that has an option for free-roam. That way the people that want to bullshit can go bullshit while the people who want to compete can go compete."
needforspeed,381y0m,RoshiFluttershy,1 point,Mon Jun 1 09:24:27 2015 UTC,"I like the UG2 system, but instead of AI, you can have duels with others, and perhaps even have like proper drag races."
needforspeed,381y0m,Purplegill10,1 point,Mon Jun 1 09:33:52 2015 UTC,"1) In the trailer, most cars (if not all) have a custom body kit, so the tuning will probably be like UG/MW/Carbon.  2) Nope.  3) Probably not. NFS has never really been very realistic. And that's a good thing. I hope  it will have similar physics to MW/Carbon and not like Rivals (where you could/had to drift through every corner in full speed)."
needforspeed,381y0m,RoshiFluttershy,3,Mon Jun 1 08:56:44 2015 UTC,"I hope they have a detailed kit modding instead of the horrible ""Run"" one... the handling isn't that big of an issue, though contrary to popular opinions, I feel Pro Street had the most fun handling physics I tried.  and hopefully this time they include actual JDM cars that will bring nostalgia.  AE86."
needforspeed,381y0m,Purplegill10,2,Mon Jun 1 09:06:06 2015 UTC,"I agree that Prostreet had some nice physics. The main reason I love that game is the tuning though. When compared to other NFS games, it is the most in depth tuning we have, and the closest to realism we've been until NFS'15 drops anyway. Also, PS did feature the AE86 in its car list."

needforspeed,381y0m,Davie_Doobie,3,Mon Jun 1 18:29:15 2015 UTC,"Or they'll fuck us over like they did with The RUN and give us pre-set customization options. It's heartbreaking because I've (and I'm sure you have too) been such a huge fan of the series. I loved UG, UG2, MW. Carbon I though was weak...Undercover was complete butt. Then I think Hot Pursuit came out in 2010?? I've been searching for a racing game to fill the void that HP 2010 left in my heart. The Run was disrespectful. Most Wanted (2012) was EA and Criterion raping their Fanbase, and Rivals was cool.....but 8-players max in a lobby?? C'mon, it was 2013 for god's sake. Of course this is all my opinion, feel free to disagree.   Also, I really liked the fast-paced full-speed racing of Hot Pursuit, so I was okay with the driving in Rivals. You didn't care for it?"
needforspeed,381y0m,VenomousAvO,2,Mon Jun 1 09:11:09 2015 UTC,"Same here, pro strert and going forward is the downhill run of NFS, and they didn't at least drift the hairpins and add some form of nice new things, they juat stuck to their lane at 20 kph."

The one's that complain that it's too arcadey and doesn't drive like a sim even though it wasn't advertised as one? The one's that are negative just because it uses the UPlay launcher (which really isn't that bad. It's part of the horse beating that used to be Origin)? The one's that complain about microtransactions despite the best cars for competitive play being IGC? The one's like this which have nothing to do with the game, but the Ubishit support, despite not mattering for game quality?   While I have had an amazing time playing this game, I cannot in good conscience recommend it to anyone as Ubisoft support is lacking on a good day, downright rude and dismissive on bad.    The main cons that I can say are true are these.  -Weird crash and collision physics (also true to NFSW)  -Lack of Japanese cars like the LFA  -Only 8 people per a session   Cops are complete tanks, but a total joke that never really stops you (Also true to NFSW)"

That's pretty pathetic and will undoubtedly hurt sales numbers.  Let's continue to politely get on EA's back about this because you would have to think they can seperate the multi-player/co-op experience with the single player experience in such a way that they can allow people to play the game off-line while not compromising their online components.

The handling was pretty frikking realistic. It slid if you went in too fast (and didn't just keep the speed up by ""drifting"" at 160mph). It lost traction as you go off-road (as any car would if it was built for the road and then made to go off-road).. The AI wasn't completely worthless (although, imo, Carbon was the last NFS with proper AI). And the graphics, for its time, was phenomenal.   That said, I wish it was a little longer as a game, but it showed me that EA knew what they were doing. They, however, lost that trust with MW2012 and Rivals. These two games that made me feel the least involved in the racing genre.  EDIT: I just ranted me arse out to my friend about this..

I can't believe I wasted $50 on the digital version even though it came with all the DLC. And if you're talking about the cutscenes after the crashes then I think you're forgetting that every NFS game has had them, though perhaps not as dramatic.

Sure it had its faults but it was thoroughly enjoyable. As was Prostreet. I hated Carbon though. Never could get into it.

needforspeed,37lx9a,YotasAndPolestars,1 point,Thu May 28 17:53:21 2015 UTC,"Depends on what you define as a 'good pursuit'. The pursuits in Undercover were far more realistic than Most Wanted and its 'rolling roadblocks' and whatnot. Personal preference I guess. I like things to be realistic, hence why I play more Forza, Gran Turismo and DriveClub than I do NFS. You're right about yellow tinge in Undercover but its just there to set a mood for the game. Carbon was rather blue and Most Wanted had a tan or brownish color if I'm not mistaken. I don't agree with you as far as not enjoying the colors chosen by the people in charge of the visuals. I think they did their jobs well in conveying the mood of the game. The heavy use of brown and yellows in MW and Undercover just set the stage of how you're on the other side of the law, giving the games a dirty, grimy feel."

In this age of video games, having indestructible cars like in the original games is a clear immersion breaker, but if you want to encourage aggressive driving, I would hope the new NFS would have visual damage and minor performance damage.  That's to say, no constant 'totalling' unless it's a drag mode or something similar."
