fcdallas,3e31da,CtheBarbarian,8,Tue Jul 21 16:00:13 2015 UTC,I think it's split among what people think a supporters group is supposed to be.   I can say for the Lone Star Legion (We have the trombone and trumpets) its about organic growth. We have no affiliation with the FO. No real leadership. No memberships. We pay for everything ourselves.   We like to take a little bit from supporters culture from around the world and tie into what we do. Big flags like you see in Japan. Two poles from Eastern Europe. Lots of movement in the stand like you see in Central and South America.   I can't speak for the other groups but that's our group in a nutshell. If you want more info you can message me.
fcdallas,3e31da,oBUSo_B1gT3x,5,Tue Jul 21 17:39:29 2015 UTC,"We also consistently involve other groups during gameday. Last game we had several members of El Matadors join us for the match.We try and play with the drumline and DBG.  We try and support all groups while maintaining our own, totally badass, identity."

fcdallas,3e31da,m3ntberrycrunch,2,Wed Jul 22 02:01:12 2015 UTC,We are in the beer garden. East side opposite end from where the drum line is. You can always join us at the tailgate.   We are usually there three hours before kickoff. Ask for Brandon or Randy and you will be pointed in the right direction.

fcdallas,3e31da,cgcr214,4,Tue Jul 21 18:08:33 2015 UTC,"Ima take a guess and say that some are kid friendly, some are beer friendly, and some are Hispanic friendly. They each have their focus on what type of supporter group they wanna be. That's just a guess of what I've seen"
fcdallas,3e31da,mojo_sweat,4,Tue Jul 21 16:48:13 2015 UTC,4+ is better than none
fcdallas,3e31da,WayneRooneysHairPlug,2,Tue Jul 21 23:37:20 2015 UTC,"We're all there for the same reason, no matter where you sit you're gonna hear and feel the electricity from one group or another."
fcdallas,3e31da,sumnfunky,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:12:44 2015 UTC,"From my perspective, I think they used to have just the Inferno several years back. They took on a certain character and flavor that did appeal to all FCD fans. So, the front office didn't want to blow them up, so they instead offered up different options. There are many folks that love FC Dallas and this allows them to partner up with different styles of folks. The DBG are more rowdy and drink a lot and sing a lot. The Shamrock folks are more kid friendly that drink less and sing a lot. Then, there are several other smaller groups that each have different characters. Not exactly a unified front, but there is a supporter to fit just about anyone who supports FCD. Just my 2 cents..."
fcdallas,3e31da,brrit2000,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:35:07 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the comments so far. This to me is one of the problems I see with FC Dallas.  We are never going to convince the front office to spend more, we aren't going to get a better beer selection (also a club decision), and even with our support it's going to take a little bit more to sell out a stadium.    As cool as offering different experiences is, 4 people talking at the exact same time doesn't quite make a conversation.  To me there just isn't really a 'culture' or 'identity' for FC Dallas.  You have soul (ex. Trombone Guy) but just nothing concrete. The largest supporter group chants generic MLS chants and on goal kicks yells ""You suck asshole"".  I mean thats cute, but it's not something that identifies us.  I've made it my goal to go see every MLS team at their home stadiums and so far as expected Portland has been leagues beyond. And it comes down to really a unified supporters group.  Hell even Colorado has TIFOs. One thing that I personally would love to see other than a Unified supporters group, is less generic chanting and more song. There still isn't anything cooler than an entire stadium singing the same song.  Plus with the families that do attend, this is something that they could engage with rather than cussing at a goal keeper."
fcdallas,3e31da,Yek0p,2,Tue Jul 21 22:56:57 2015 UTC,"So, you feel Portland has the best atmosphere which is understandable, but what do you suggest we do to achieve that here in Dallas?  I think many people would agree that we would like to take Dallas to the next level but it is easier said that done and we have numerous people in the different supporter groups doing all that they can to help us grow."
fcdallas,3e31da,ODCLegion,2,Wed Jul 22 06:31:16 2015 UTC,"What I would like to see is us to achieve something.  I don't want to copy Portland, nor do I want to copy any other team.  I see it like a band, when you have numerous instruments playing to the beat of different drums, its not really music. But get them all on the same beat, it becomes something.    And you're right it is easier said than done, but we are Texans. Nothing comes easy."
fcdallas,3dzrig,thenatesummers,2,Mon Jul 20 21:14:46 2015 UTC,I think maybe only zendejas gets some time on the pitch

So, until FCD announces it, it’s not a done deal."

fcdallas,3dijlg,totspur1982,3,Thu Jul 16 15:38:07 2015 UTC,LOYD AT RB!!! YES!! Would it free up an int'l spot? Bekker was Canadian and  SOUMARE is from Mali.  *sorry for the caps lock I don't think the Hunt group would  spend money even at gun point so I still don't see anything else big happening
fcdallas,3dijlg,worthyfox,3,Thu Jul 16 17:12:50 2015 UTC,Soumare has American citizenship so yes.  :)

fcdallas,3dijlg,sumnfunky,3,Thu Jul 16 16:24:42 2015 UTC,"I'm anxious to see how Bakary fits in.  I won't lie I feel like Ulloa at least has been really strong in the mid, Acosta is getting there but if this guy is solid we may have ourselves a little midfield stronghold going, which will be nice when we play super teams like the Galaxy or NYCFC. As far as a future signing of anyone I doubt Dan Hunt has even thought about it. In case you haven't noticed he likes his money.    Edit; upon further review it looks like this guy may play on the back line. Where as to what I said about our midfield would probably not change. We will see what happens."
fcdallas,3dijlg,lg_3000,5,Thu Jul 16 16:46:40 2015 UTC,Allegedly they're looking at adding a defensive mid.
fcdallas,3dijlg,totspur1982,2,Thu Jul 16 17:15:21 2015 UTC,Yeah he is a CB which is a spot where we have been lacking depth. Not sure how good he is but it's something and it addresses a need.
fcdallas,3dijlg,Makelevi,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:15:08 2015 UTC,"TFC fan here. How did Bekker do for you guys during his time there? I was surprised at the trade as, while I like Bekker, I didn't think he was a good gamble for a club's international slot."

fcdallas,3cymuc,totspur1982,5,Sat Jul 11 23:36:37 2015 UTC,Because we lack any depth at center back. Who do you think could do a better job?
fcdallas,3cymuc,brrit2000,3,Sat Jul 11 23:46:03 2015 UTC,That's the most frustrating part. The hunt group won't sign anyone
fcdallas,3cymuc,huskydefender55,4,Sun Jul 12 00:02:17 2015 UTC,"I think he's doing a great job at CB, the issue is that we don't have anyone to replace him at RB. Even if we move him back out, what happens if he's injured? We need another MLS level RB. And while I'm dreaming, we could use another CDM and Striker."
fcdallas,3cymuc,HealthHazard,3,Sun Jul 12 02:09:38 2015 UTC,I agree. Keel is serviceable and Zimmerman is capable but he just doesn't put it together. That said I'd rather sign a right back and never let Harris play right back again.

fcdallas,3csoyp,serious_black,3,Fri Jul 10 13:36:44 2015 UTC,THIS! This is amazing news. I like this more than development clubs in _________(not Texas). We have so much untouched talent. Need to expand with more academies in these Hispanic areas of Texas. Such a huge demographic so many people forget about.
fcdallas,3co70n,durbin1898,10,Thu Jul 9 12:58:28 2015 UTC,It will be business as usual here. I really wish the Hunts were implicated in the FIFA scandal and would have to sell the team.  A boy can dream I guess.
fcdallas,3co70n,oBUSo_B1gT3x,5,Thu Jul 9 14:38:15 2015 UTC,"If anything could get them to spend, this would be it. There is a clause that says if you don't spend it, you lose it. We get $100K this year, and if we don't spend it by the end of 2016, it's gone. Even if they use it to buy down a DP, they are REQUIRED to sign a DP of greater value than the one they're buying. I like this rule, it really incentivizes the clubs to sign new DPs."
fcdallas,3co70n,huskydefender55,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:50:07 2015 UTC,Are they required to use this on a DP? If so the Hunts would use more as a discount on a cheap DP.   Havnt even read the rule yet TBH. I'll read it and see what's going down.
fcdallas,3co70n,oBUSo_B1gT3x,3,Thu Jul 9 17:27:25 2015 UTC,"They are required to use this on DPs. It's not going to make them go out and buy a huge DP, but it does mean we'll get another DP. This isn't money they can just sit on, they have to use it or lose it. Or, a very Hunt thing to do would be to ignore it, and trade it all for a draft pick in 2016. I'm hoping they don't, because they'd be giving a rival a huge boost towards a star player for yet another unproven college kid."
fcdallas,3co70n,huskydefender55,4,Thu Jul 9 18:17:37 2015 UTC,"I would imagine they'll use it, but spend it on a cheap Central or South American DP.    The SB Nation post that broke the new deal down said they feel it's a way to either nudge or push out cheap skate owners.  The owners will realize they have to spend money to keep up and will either A) spend money or B) realize spending is getting out of hand and cash out."
fcdallas,3co70n,lg_3000,2,Thu Jul 9 17:33:16 2015 UTC,"I forgot about the part of the new rule that said you have to spend the same amount of money on the new player you sign. So, I don't see them doing it."
fcdallas,3co70n,lg_3000,0,Fri Jul 10 01:19:33 2015 UTC,I hope is does something. I know a lot of people are aginst Abou Diaby but I think the younger midfielders could benefit from him and he would help. So I'd like to see that signing. I am very aware  this is an unpopular  position  but it'd be something
fcdallas,3co70n,PlatypusFeatures,3,Thu Jul 9 18:07:57 2015 UTC,They could learn the best way to pass the time when injured.
fcdallas,3co70n,lg_3000,3,Thu Jul 9 18:18:38 2015 UTC,Honestly I wish we'd have owners like LA has. Take advantage of the rules to make your team better and have a great academy system. So far we have one of those.   It would be nice to see one or two Liga MX players on the team that would contribute to winning and put butts in seats.
fcdallas,3co70n,TylerGuest1,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:21:19 2015 UTC,"I agree, it doesn't have to even be some Liga MX  players. I think any experienced midfielder who has play at a high level consistently would help a ton. I'd like to see them try and get some Euro talent as well"
fcdallas,3co70n,cgcr214,2,Thu Jul 9 18:31:26 2015 UTC,"Chicharito would be nice. He'd bring in a lot of hype and he's fallen out of favor with van Gaal. Rumors are that he could go to MLS, and IF (this is a huge if) the Hunts are willing to shell out the cash, we are a possibility if the rumors are true.   A pipe dream probably, but I'm allowed to dream."

His ball movement and vision are extraordinary, and he's got a great shot as well.  Keep him fit and he will be a difference maker on your side. Arsene Wenger kept him around for years waiting for him. It's been a rough go, and of course it's a risk, but I hope that whoever does land him benefits from his abilities."

FCD tends to focus on player development, having one of the three best mls academies (LA Galaxy and NY Red Bulls having the other two) FCD just opened an academy in Costa Rica as well. They also ""walk the talk"" as they play their products, having (last I heard) the most homegrown minutes in the league.  The ownership tends to avoid splashing cash on big players (as I understand they've been burned in the past) but focus their scouting in central and south America, trying to get that most bang for their buck.  They are a charter club of mls, owned by the Hunt family.  Look up Lamar Hunt, who did a lot to grow the game in the States."

Pretty much every major team in the world sends a team during that week, from U-8 to U-23 The coach was also a former player in the Dallas Burn days. Supporting FC Dallas will have its lows (being in the bottom of the table) and highs (being on top of the table/deep playoff run) multiple times in a season. Top two players are Diaz and Castillo.

Stupid mistake after stupid mistake. Then we had no one on the bench to go to. I have no idea why we try to just play the forwards up the middle and atempt to cram the ball between some defenders. It won't work against a team like seattle. We have to play smart every minute and have to start opening those corners up and spread the opposing's team defense out wide.   We have to be the team that says ""Ok we let one goal in but we cannot let it ruin our day"". We seem to loose our head when someone scores against us, and then never recover."

We don't have them, because they are too cheap and too committed to the overall sport of soccer in the USA. I guess the latter isn't exactly a bad thing, but it does nothing for us as FC Dallas fans.

fcdallas,393m1v,WayneRooneysHairPlug,3,Tue Jun 9 00:42:17 2015 UTC,it is for a number of things.  one being the sun. the west side of the stadium gets more shade. people who are willing to pay $$$ for tickets would rather sit in the shade.  two the tv camera points to the east stand. cheaper tickets = more seats sold = looks like a fuller stadium on tv.
fcdallas,393m1v,vanskater,3,Tue Jun 9 13:41:41 2015 UTC,You sure you don't mean the west side? They have always been more expensive.
fcdallas,393m1v,IDontLikeAnyofYall,4,Tue Jun 9 02:43:12 2015 UTC,"They are closer to the benches, closer to the ""clubhouse"", and typically have more shade than the seats on the other side."
fcdallas,393m1v,dances_with_ronaldo,0,Tue Jun 9 01:48:56 2015 UTC,Wouldn't seats on the east side have the sun glaring in their face in the afternoon?
fcdallas,393m1v,dances_with_ronaldo,4,Tue Jun 9 02:39:29 2015 UTC,"I think you have East and West mixed up. The most expensive season tickets are on the west side, right above the benches."

fcdallas,37dv41,Jimla,0,Tue May 26 23:24:25 2015 UTC,"“Escobar is a player that can fit in anywhere in the midfield,” said FC Dallas Technical Director Fernando Clavijo. “He is more of an attacking player than a defensive player but the number one thing he adds is experience. We feel he is a guy that can come in and contribute right away, which is rare in MLS, especially in his position. We are looking ahead to a very competitive second half of the season. Escobar’s experience, knowledge and quality will help us.”    33, but it seems like a good amount of this addition has to do with intangibles."

He was always a good pro here, but like he said it just didn't pan out.  In particular, it sucked that he came up at a time when it was even harder than now for younger players to get games (the MLS Reserve League was a joke), and the coach he mentioned (Steve Morrow, former defender at Arsenal) was replaced by the long-time SMU head coach Schellas Hyndman, who was the owner's college soccer coach (FCD is owned by the Hunt family of KC Chiefs fame) and, perhaps ironically, notoriously unwilling to trust young players."

fcdallas,35k8ea,jedi168,1 point,Wed May 13 15:50:25 2015 UTC,"You may remember me from word clouds I made in every MLB, Premier League, NHL, NBA, and NFL team subreddit for their last respective seasons, or my Swears/Subscriber Breakdown by for states/cities/regional subreddits and my previous sports profanity breakdown. I gathered this data for this using a modified version of a script made by the folks over at /r/MUWs. If you want to create your own word cloud for another subreddit, you can post requests there. I have also done several requests, as the default /r/MUW bot does only a monthly breakdown, and as I have several sports and city related dictionaries I use to filter out particularly common words that are not normally detected. The actual word maps were made through Wordle. My apologies if these are difficult to see. I suffer from monochromatic colorblindness, so I had to use hex codes I found online when putting this together. Common words such as “the”, “and”, “I'm”, as well as numbers were removed from the clouds.  To get at swearing frequencies, I took the raw data (including “the”, “and”, etc.), totaled all the words, and then added up all instances of swearing. Each category of swearing had several words that made it up, as the raw data does not differentiate between plural and singular forms. Common prefixes and suffixes were added. For instance, motherfuckers show up in the fuck category. The non-American category includes such words as twat, bugger, wanker, bastard, arse, arsehole, and shite. Genitalia includes cock, cunt, pussy, dickhead, tits, and cocksucker.  Words per subscriber were obviously obtained by dividing the number of words used by the number of subscribers to the sub and the subscriber counts were taken at the time my scan took place."

fcdallas,35geke,ur6ci124q,1 point,Sun May 10 03:04:37 2015 UTC,That's good. I was really worried looking at the line up for defense. Seeing Harris in there starting.. I cringed. Glad to hear Zimmerman coming through.
fcdallas,35geke,Max2Phresh,2,Sun May 10 05:20:44 2015 UTC,"I thought the defense was pretty solid all night. Zimmerman was just a beast in the middle.  The offense, especially the passing was sloppy throughout the game. They had streaks where they would get some good possessions but I though they were really slow at the start of the game. They looked really good at the end of both halves, though, and when it mattered they did what they do.  Overall, very entertaining game!"

fcdallas,35geke,ur6ci124q,2,Sun May 10 02:56:03 2015 UTC,"id say he did alright.  notice that he had the unenviable task of marking Gonzales on all set pieces and by and large kept him in check - he flashed a head on the first corner but it was well off target and no real threat.    He and zimmerman were eating husidic & co's lunch.    his strength in the air and length we're really a problem for LAG, for a skinny guy hes pretty stout in the air and strong against defenders with their backs to the goal.  He doesnt dive often and, imo, is a strong defender.    I think he doesnt get a lot of credit for how well he spaces out the field and he can be deceptively creative... it was him digging the ball out of our end of the field with a bit of creativity that helped spring diaz for the big cross to tesho for the go ahead goal.  granted he caused a bit of the chaos with a missed touch.  His shooting was bad and he did have a few rough touches, but i think its off base to call him out as often as our fans do."
fcdallas,35geke,joeorangeshoes,1 point,Sun May 10 16:53:04 2015 UTC,"Perhaps I spoke with haste.

Castillo the trickster, akindelle is last year's ROTY, Diaz the magician. Just exciting to watch.  I've been unimpressed with San Jose early on."
fcdallas,35gjep,BigOHeadphones,3,Sun May 10 04:44:00 2015 UTC,"Well we are having a great year right now, but more importantly I think you would enjoy supporting us more because we are after all a lot closer to home! Living in Texas you are more likely to be exposed to more FC Dallas games and fans. Personally I think rooting for a home team gives you a much more real connection and sense of pride to a team rather than rooting for a team you'll never be able to see play without traveling halfway across the country! You'll always feel as part though your part of a group/region when rooting for the home team. Very similar to how everyone feels extremely proud and patriotic when it comes to rooting for the U.S. national teams because thats their country, their flag! I just don't think you can get that by rooting for a team in Cali!"
fcdallas,35gjep,EmmaWatsonSitOnMyFac,2,Sun May 10 06:46:29 2015 UTC,"I'm from Austin, and considered the same dilemma once upon a time.  For me the question came down to this:  Fandom is created by real life experience.  Just watching on TV with no real experience to reinforce it doesn't do it for me.  Dallas is a place I can get to pretty easily to see a game.  Every now and then FC Dallas comes here to play preseason games.  (They did this year)  I can and do run across FC Dallas shirts on occasion in Austin, and if I feel like it I can strike up a conversation with them.  I seriously doubt you are going to get that with any remote team like San Jose.  (though I have nothing against them)  By the way, for the same reasons I have watched less and less European and South American soccer over the years.  Sure it's great, it's the best in the world, but for me the real-life personal connection is what makes me a fan."

I've been to 4 games this year and I find myself watching how both teams perform more than just keeping my eyes on the Dallas players. As our league grows there's a possibility of maybe a San Antonio team or an Austin team. So don't feel you have to pick a side just yet. This is a beautiful game. Slowly but surely our fellow Americans are creating better art. Just be apart of the culture, that's what really matters."
fcdallas,35gjep,CtheBarbarian,1 point,Sun May 10 14:29:10 2015 UTC,"FC Dallas was part of the original group of teams that started when then league was created. They have a great academy that produces a lot of homegrown players, some of which end up playing for the first team."

fcdallas,35ayy2,worthyfox,1 point,Fri May 8 16:48:45 2015 UTC,Honestly I just wish they'd reschedule. They literally turned the lights off as Barrios attempted a shot in that game. Not quite sure how that would have played out had it gone in. Folks then had to run from the stands and those who stuck around in the area for the restart (mostly watching the Mavs game in the club or across the street) had to do so for 3+ hours. To top it off this club was on the road for a near fatality from lightning just last year...

He isn't going to make the highlight reels in comparison to Diaz and Castillo, but he's sitting there in the midfield helping all transitions of the game and you aren't ever cursing his name. He does his job correctly and if you watch him he pops up everywhere and it really helping to control the distribution of the ball and the tempo of the game.   When you want some flashy creativity you have Diaz creating that attack out of the midfield, but when you just need a job done in allowing any of that to happen Ulloa is in the midfield making it possible.   The fact that he's homegrown is just icing on the cake."

That said, I think it's good for any team to have a bad guy or two in it. Lacking a marquee name in the side, a striker who pesters opposing players is a good asset to have.  I'm not concerned about what other clubs and their fans think of us. That doesn't mean I think anything goes, but I don't think a player with a slightly nasty edge to his game is the end of the world.  There seems to be this perception in American soccer that it's a gentleman's game, and maybe that will be true for the American game in the long run.

Anyway, Barrios on the right and Castillo on the left, holy fuck. First two goals were buried with the ball heading in the direction of where I was standing. In fact, Castillo wrapped his foot around his shot so well that I knew it was going in from 10 yards out. Perez' goal, what the fuck was up with Toronto's defense? Actually that could be said about all of our goals. Anyway, glad to see us put three past Barney the Purple Dinosaur."

fcdallas,32qf8o,seafoodslut1988,2,Fri Apr 17 15:08:59 2015 UTC,"How cool! I'm sure they'll love it.    Flash Seats is pretty simple.  The card that you used to purchase the tickets is essentially your access to the game.  You just swipe it with the card readers at the gate and then we'll print you out a seat locator.  You can also: * add other forms of ID to your Flash Seats account (should be in your confirmation email) * or download the app on a smartphone and sync with your account to bring up a QR code to scan at the gate.    Once you use Flash Seats once, it will be very straight forward every time after.  We'll see you here tomorrow!"

fcdallas,32qf8o,ur6ci124q,2,Fri Apr 17 04:22:40 2015 UTC,I just wish they did the fcd express bus from Dallas to Frisco like last year. I really hate that it was discontinued and they didn't tell the fans it would be. I probably won't renew my season tickets if they don't get it going again just bc it is so far.

To put it in perspective, though, we have some Season Ticket Holders from 3 or 4 hours away who make it to almost every match.    This game is on a Saturday evening, which should leave you with plenty of time to get here.  Come early and tailgate!  DTID."
fcdallas,32qf8o,devish,3,Fri Apr 17 14:24:56 2015 UTC,For me it's more of a 60-70 minute drive. I'm thinking of joining El Matador. I went to the Dallas LA game back in October and I saw their energetic atmosphere and wanted to be a part of it.
fcdallas,32qf8o,pumasplayer7,2,Fri Apr 17 14:41:31 2015 UTC,Come sit with El Matador this Saturday!  Free beer (2 Kegs) available to anyone of age and hanging out in section 117.. plus free tacos!

fcdallas,32kizu,satellitebob,1 point,Wed Apr 15 20:19:25 2015 UTC,Awesome! A table sounds fancy! I'm hoping there will be some other fans in our section (section 101) to cheer and sing with us. Nobody likes the only 2 people in a section standing up all night and singing loudly and off-key.
fcdallas,32kizu,satellitebob,2,Wed Apr 15 22:03:35 2015 UTC,If this table isn't one of those classy on the sideline tables we will see you sooner than later.  It seems in the past there's been a good size group going to the Colorado game.

fcdallas,328h1e,devish,1 point,Sun Apr 12 15:05:00 2015 UTC,An injury to the face isn't going to be as bad as an injury to the leg. It might have been a concussion or something like that.
fcdallas,328h1e,lofiBathSalts,2,Tue Apr 14 15:15:08 2015 UTC,"Sidelined at practice due to injury according to some of the comments on this article. Also says it was precautionary more than anything, so hopefully he's back soon!"
fcdallas,328h1e,Jsatter,2,Sat Apr 11 15:38:20 2015 UTC,"Man that loss hurt. Read earlier that the Rapids were winless for 18 until that 4-0 they put on us. :/.... I could be wrong, but I think that's correct.  Not going to blame the loss on the refs, but I'm pretty sure he forgot his cards in the locker room the first half and then didn't want to deviate too much from his calling style in the second... We still would have lost even with a few calls, but still.  The attacking portion just wasn't on the same page. Seemed like we would have some good stuff lined up with Tesho but others weren't following up. Our attacking side played well individually IMHO but terrible together.   Our defense was just dismal. All I have to say about that."
fcdallas,328h1e,Suihaki,0,Sun Apr 12 05:20:40 2015 UTC,"Since others have already hit on why he wasn't playing, I'm going to disagree with you and say that his being sidelined made a huge difference in how we played. We need a left back and he definitely makes a difference on that side when he's in."
fcdallas,328h1e,murm87,1 point,Sat Apr 11 20:36:25 2015 UTC,"He's a vital player, don't get me wrong. There was just a lot lacking in our forward play and a few turnovers that were almost inexcusable. I know we will bounce back. Just a rough night, everyone has them."
fcdallas,328h1e,murm87,0,Sat Apr 11 20:44:05 2015 UTC,Definitely. Just have to remember it's still early in the season and there are many more games to play.
fcdallas,32729o,motioneso,4,Sat Apr 11 03:28:13 2015 UTC,"Definitely a tough loss, but hopefully the boys can learn something from it. I hope it doesn't hurt Seitzy too much mentally, not much he could have done."

fcdallas,325vwb,TweetsInCommentsBot,2,Fri Apr 10 21:18:55 2015 UTC,"I'm sure we're all feeling very comfortable about this, given that Colorado has yet to score a goal and how our defense has allowed so few.  From what I understand, if Colorado loses this game, they will have set a new MLS record for 'number of games without a win.'  Considering their first three games were 0-0, I'm not expecting a cake-walk.  I'm sure they do NOT want to have the honor of setting that record, and the game is going to be a battle."

Hedges is the heart of the FCDallas defense, and San Antonio is all of 4 hours away.  I wouldn't be mad if he'll a USMNT starting defender, but that seems unlikely, and we really need him out there as captain.    Seems more likely our coach is rotating needlessly, or Matt got hurt today.  EDIT: Lol.  They even retweeted a picture of him and he's not on the roster."

fcdallas,327d4u,HealthHazard,2,Sat Apr 11 05:28:33 2015 UTC,There was absolutely no communication from our back line.
fcdallas,327d4u,jord4nrob,2,Sat Apr 11 14:07:53 2015 UTC,I honestly don't think the back line was the major issue. Although Watson had a howler. We got bossed in the middle of the pitch. Powers looked like he had all day every time he had the ball at his foot

fcdallas,324oas,BigOHeadphones,0,Fri Apr 10 17:19:02 2015 UTC,I think this is one of the best ways to enjoy the game.  See you down there!
fcdallas,320i02,RagingBull2488,4,Thu Apr 9 16:27:13 2015 UTC,"4231, no question. 442 leaves us exposed at the back — we need the DM coverage for our backline.               Blas/Tesho     Castillo - Diaz - Tesho/Watson          Ulloa - Hollingshead Hernandez - Hedges - Zimmerman - Loyd                Seitz  Subs: Texeira, Barrios, Bekker, Michel, Zimmerman, Kennedy   I can't imagine Tesho at CAM, he's not that kind of player. He's a target forward replacement for Blas 100% and the few glimpses he's seen of that position he has flourished.  As for Diaz, I'm sad we haven't seen more of Danny Garcia in Diaz's absence. Garcia was fantastic the few minutes he played last year. He has similar vision and control of the ball to Diaz, not as good but definitely a suitable replacement while Diaz remains injured.  Lastly, I'm trying to reserve my opinion on Hollingshead. I see him fumble over the ball, rush decisions, and therefore misplace a lot of passes, especially against Portland last week. This is the first he's been a consistent starter, so maybe he'll settle, but I'm hoping it happens very soon as we're already 5 games into a 34 game season (~15%).  Edit: Ah, forgot to mention Harris. Yeah, well... he's been awful in my opinion. I'd rather have Zimmerman at CB with Hedges (he needs to play to grow anyways) and slot Loyd over to RB than have Harris in the line-up."
fcdallas,320i02,b0xors,1 point,Thu Apr 9 21:54:43 2015 UTC,Agree with what you've said. I would have Barrios as back-up RW though but thats just personal preference.
fcdallas,320i02,PlatypusFeatures,1 point,Fri Apr 10 12:08:09 2015 UTC,"Why bench Michel?  He seems like such an important component of the team.  I think his set piece delivery is too good to have him on the bench.  Also, I wonder why Barrios doesn't get the start at RM.  Does he burn out quickly?    I think Akindele out wide is awkward - he seems like a through-and-through striker to me as well."
fcdallas,320i02,chickenmagic,2,Fri Apr 10 20:58:06 2015 UTC,"Watson is back in shape and I expect him to take over RB from Harris starting tomorrow.  I liked the idea of the 4-1-3-2 we played against SJ, but honestly it felt disjointed without Michel. I keep thinking that time has passed him by, and he keeps proving me wrong. His long balls to our speedy wingers are key to the counter-attacking system. See goal #2 vs. SKC for a prime example (2:07).   Would I prefer that we play a possession game instead of a counter-attacking game? Yes, at home when Diaz is healthy. That could be the time to rest Michel and play the 4-1-3-2 like we saw against SJ. Ulloa has completely proven himself in the last year and so I believe he can hold down the fort as lone CDM. I'd like us to really go after goals at home with our best attacking lineup.         Blas  Tesho Castillo  Diaz  Hollingshead           Ulloa  Mo  Hedges  Loyd  Watson           Seitz   On the road, we will see a lot of counter-attacking speed from the 4-2-3-1/4-4-2 with 2 DMs to shield the defense. I think Diaz gets rested in a lot of away games, especially those on turf. He gets bypassed on the counter anyway.            Blas              Tesho Castillo          Hollingshead       Michel   Ulloa  Mo  Hedges  Loyd  Watson           Seitz   On the occasion that we go with a 4-2-3-1 with both Michel and Diaz, Pareja has a tough choice to make between Tesho and Hollingshead. I like Tesho much better as a CF than a RW. This formation is probably the most balanced, providing possession and the opportunity to counter attack. Tesho or Ryan is the 60' super sub, stretching the defense when they are tiring.            Blas Castillo    Diaz   Tesho/Hollingshead       Michel   Ulloa  Mo  Hedges  Loyd  Watson           Seitz"
fcdallas,320i02,luetchy10,1 point,Thu Apr 9 22:27:51 2015 UTC,What do you think about running the 442 diamond? I feel like that would be a solid set up as well.
fcdallas,320i02,luetchy10,1 point,Fri Apr 10 06:34:28 2015 UTC,"That's basically what we do when Michel is out. I characterize it as a 4-1-3-2 because our outside mids are offensive-minded. You'll never see Mo overlap Castillo, but you will see Harris/Watson overlap Hollingshead/Tesho."

fcdallas,31kwyu,medicmarch,15,Mon Apr 6 01:36:29 2015 UTC,"I only started following the team last year.  MLS is just  alot different than European soccer.  It's rougher around the edges.  The reffing is questionable.  Players are not as good.  The league is young and has odd rules.  With that being said, its a blast rooting for a team that plays locally as opposed to over the pond, and even though it isn't the best soccer, the games are still super entertaining to watch and attend.  Now for the team.  FCD is a team built off young and homegrown players (players from the academy and local area) .  I think we had the most homegrown players play last season out of every team. It's pretty much the equivalent of building through the draft in the NFL.  This bodes very well for the team long term.  Especially since more games for our young players means more experience and hopefully better performances.  This also means the Hunt family (Like Lamar Hunt) is less apt to buying big name stars, so don't expect any big name players coming to Frisco anytime soon. This year FCD should be strong contenders for the MLS Cup and Supporter's Shield.  I won't go over every player because that can be overwhelming, but I will highlight a few.    Number Name Description    24 Matt Hedges Captain and anchor of our defense.  He is one of the best defenders in MLS   31 Michel He may be the ugliest man in MLS, but he has a magical left foot.  Expect him to take a lot of free kicks and create opportunities from deep in the midfield   11 Fabian Castillo Fabi is a Columbian winger who just might be the fastest man in MLS.  He is an exciting young player that will burn through any defense   7 Blas Perez You hate him if he's playing you, but love it when he's on you team.  This Panamanian will annoy the shit out of the other team and rack up tons of goals from the center forward position   10 Mauro Diaz He is an amazing Argentine who was an early MVP candidate last year until injuries ruined his season.  Expect him to be one of the biggest offensive X-Factors if he can stay healthy"

fcdallas,31kwyu,mrrangerz,3,Mon Apr 6 15:02:35 2015 UTC,"I've been following since '05 (odd because that's when they rebranded/moved to Frisco and I live downtown and resent them for it, but that's neither here nor there).  Dallas was one of the original clubs in '96 (as the Dallas Burn) and we won our only cup in '97 in the US Open Cup. We've been to the MLS Cup one time in 2010 and lost to the Colorado Rapids.  Right now the general feeling around the league is that MLS, which is single entity, doesn't view FC Dallas as a ""premier club,"" which means we're going to be one of the last clubs considered for a marquee Designated Player signing like Lampard, Gerrard, or Kaka. But our coach Oscar Pareja ran our youth development program for years and because of that we're thought of as having one of the best youth systems in the league, which is showing with youngsters like Victor Ulloa and Kellyn Acosta playing big minutes.  In any case, we're one of the strongest teams in the league right now and incredibly fun to watch. Sadly, the team discontinued the FCD Express bus which picked you up on Lower Greenville and took you to the game, but if it's not inconvenient I'd try to go to as many games as possible. The stadium atmosphere has greatly improved and the beer garden is a great place to watch if you want to be around the supporters groups.  Otherwise, there's watching groups scattered across the metroplex. The one I am going to now is the new FCDeep which watches the games at Anvil Pub in Deep Ellum, so come on by for a beer!

fcdallas,31kwyu,mrrangerz,2,Mon Apr 6 22:50:25 2015 UTC,"Oh man I forgot to mention RIVALRIES! Here's some to know:  Houston Dynamo: Pretty self explanatory: We hate Houston. Since the Dynamo were created from the old San Jose Earthquakes in 2005, Dallas and Houston have played for El Capitan, a big awesome cannon that gets fired after the games. We currently have the cannon though Houston leads the all time series 5-4-1.  Chicago Fire: Early in the MLS days the supporters groups for the two teams, Chicago Fire and the then Dallas Burn, decided to strike up a friendly rivalry based on the two team names, hence the Brimstone cup. It's not really considered all that important anymore, but it's still fun.  Colorado Rapids: This might be just me, but I really dislike Colorado. In the 2006 playoffs Colorado eliminated Dallas on penalty kicks and the players began disrespecting our oldest supporters group, The Inferno. Dario Sala, the beloved goalie at the time, ended up punching Hunter Freeman in the back of the head as a result and spent his 6 game suspension the next year drumming in the stands. Colorado also beat FC Dallas in the 2010 MLS Cup. I really don't like the Rapids.  Portland Timbers: This is a new one, but in the last game where Portland defeated Dallas 3-1, Pareja handed the Portland coach Caleb Porter a tissue as a mockery of his crybaby attitude. It didn't go over well. Keep an eye out the next time we play."

fcdallas,31h9vh,TheLastBison,1 point,Sun Apr 5 04:00:56 2015 UTC,I agree from what I could see he looked offsides. However we should've had better defending there.

fcdallas,31ccct,ur6ci124q,1 point,Mon Apr 6 16:00:22 2015 UTC,Yeah. We are for sure working on the sound issues. Thanks for the input and your support. We are recording a new episode tonight and hope to have it out and posted by Thursday.
fcdallas,31963v,totspur1982,5,Fri Apr 3 00:09:51 2015 UTC,"Coop is a great person and locker-room guy and while I think Blas is a better target forward, I think Coop would be a better stand-in for Blas than Texeira when Blas is injured or with Panama.  However, I'm not sure either Texeira or Cooper are worth their salaries to spend most of their time on the bench."
fcdallas,31963v,bravoavocado,8,Fri Apr 3 03:30:08 2015 UTC,Kenny Cooper>David Texeria. Yes I want him back. It's probably more sentimental then logic. First live game he scored the winner against Houston.
fcdallas,31963v,HealthHazard,3,Fri Apr 3 01:15:59 2015 UTC,"Well if he's going to command a big salary then no, but seeing how Texeira is on a DP anyways, I wouldn't mind Coop replacing him at the very least, more likely saving us $$"
fcdallas,31963v,onetruechief,2,Fri Apr 3 05:01:07 2015 UTC,"No, not at all. He was poor here, poor in Seattle. Just keep playing Blas, move Tesho to striker when Perez is absent, and use David Texeira as a last option. Cooper would just be an overpriced bench player."
fcdallas,31963v,cgcr214,1 point,Sat Apr 4 07:07:20 2015 UTC,"NO.     He's tall but slow.    Last time he was here I saw him get routinely get beat by smaller, quicker opponents.    Blas is WAY better than him"

fcdallas,317fa7,lon_gisland,3,Thu Apr 2 16:17:57 2015 UTC,"When I used to go before I had season tickets I'd usually aim for the East side - decent price and sometimes I could get the first row. It's pretty casual over there with families and what not surrounding you. Downside is if it's hot out, the sun can cook you.   West side you'll have your sun to your back and be in the shade most likely. I believe that area has more season ticket holders, and it's a little bit more expensive. If you get closer to the middle and front, you can potentially get behind the team benches. If you get on the west side and more toward the north end there's DFE, one of the supporter groups.  South side also has a supporter group called El Matador over there who while I haven't met, I've heard a lot of great things about them. I believe there more Hispanic than the other SGs so some of their chants may be in Spanish.  North side you have the Beer Garden that is +21 with the FCD drummers and bleachers. It may be hard to get a ticket for the bleachers, but you can stand behind the seats and still watch the game."
fcdallas,317fa7,TheWrightMatt,4,Thu Apr 2 16:49:56 2015 UTC,"Downside is if it's hot out, the sun can cook you.   And note that it'll be a 6pm game, so there will be a little more sun out than the usual 7:30 or 8pm start."
fcdallas,312ffh,Hjordan5,9,Wed Apr 1 15:32:17 2015 UTC,Of course not. Because that would require spending money.

fcdallas,312ffh,Jimla,6,Thu Apr 2 14:23:40 2015 UTC,"You'd think, with the way this team is shaping up, they'd spend big to bring in a really dynamic playmaker who can help the team make a real run for the cup. We have such an opportunity this season."
fcdallas,312ffh,huskydefender55,3,Wed Apr 1 16:21:30 2015 UTC,"This. We need someone who can sit deep and play out of the back. It's so frustrating to watch Mauro struggle because no one else can hold onto the ball. We need someone who can put in a shift defensively and play out of the back. We're all run and gun right now, but short on creativity for sure."

fcdallas,312ffh,chickenmagic,2,Wed Apr 1 17:56:37 2015 UTC,"He's not built for MLS, and he's unproven outside of a possession style of play that FCD can't achieve. That's not to say he couldn't, it's just a gamble that I would hope the club wouldn't take. I don't like the idea of getting an older superstar anyway unless it's somebody like Lampard who's big enough to fit in physically and can also score goals.   If we're going to spend money on a DP I'd rather pay a lesser known quality from South America or anywhere but Europe to fill a box to box role in midfield. Bradley would've been my ideal candidate."
fcdallas,312ffh,Jimla,2,Wed Apr 1 19:02:10 2015 UTC,How about Fernando Gago?  He seems like a great fit.  It seems like Michel covers a lot of ground from his position.  Hollingshead has been looking decent as well.
fcdallas,312ffh,TylerGuest1,1 point,Wed Apr 1 19:21:21 2015 UTC,Holligshead has been looking good. Last week would have been the perfect time to see what he's got but once we went man down he had to fall into more of a defensive role.

fcdallas,30nw1x,mojo_sweat,1 point,Sun Mar 29 12:05:20 2015 UTC,"Before kick-off I was thinking the exact same thing. Obvously Howard and Rimando's days are numbered, and I think Seitz is just as good if not better than the likes of Hamid.  However, I haven't seen enough of the recent call-ups Yarbrough or Cropper to say much."
fcdallas,30nw1x,b0xors,1 point,Sun Mar 29 17:36:36 2015 UTC,I want to Seitz has had a call up before but very early in his career. He was a pretty hot commodity out of college but his first few years in MLS were pretty spotty

On the other hand, i feel like we haven't been 100% tested this season. We got away with offsides against KC, played a man up last week. We didnt face the varsity squad of Seattle tonight, even with a man down. Anybody else feel a little worried or am i being ridiculous?  Edit: Worried is the wrong word, hesitant is more appropriate"

fcdallas,30nidp,ur6ci124q,3,Sun Mar 29 04:23:48 2015 UTC,I just got home from the game. They definitely played better than I thought they would once the red was given. Castillo has some great moves. When they initially moved him out front in the second half he was all over the sounders for the first 10 to 15 minutes. This was the first time I've been or watched a 0-0 game. I loved it!

fcdallas,30f7rm,pumasplayer7,3,Thu Mar 26 21:49:23 2015 UTC,"You have a few options:   After games, you can wait outside the FO (Northwest corner) and the players will come out and sign/take pictures. Season Ticket Holder Day is usually later in the season, they have stations where you can meet each player. Attend practices. They usually practice in the morning/before noon on the fields across the North side of the stadium."

fcdallas,309pis,satellitebob,1 point,Wed Mar 25 21:41:22 2015 UTC,I thought the heat issue has been OK the last couple seasons when they've moved the summer games to a 8pm kick off. Those Sunday 2pm kick off from years ago were friggin' brutal. Hanging out in the bathroom at halftime slamming cold beers only helps so much.  It should be SC. Soccer. It's ok to say soccer.

fcdallas,304vy5,pumasplayer7,2,Wed Mar 25 12:46:19 2015 UTC,I've been to a few Dynamo games before and typically away fans sit in section 220 I believe. Usually this is all coordinated between the two front offices. Also I'm sure the supporter groups will be organizing something.

fcdallas,304vy5,WhoAteMyPizza,2,Tue Mar 24 16:47:26 2015 UTC,Last year we had an away section and a HOUSTON ticket rep to go through. I'm sure more details will come out closer to the match.

We tailgated with the Southsiders and they all went to our hotel bar to hang out afterwards. Was a pretty good trip.   I think with it being a Friday there will be people who travel, but there might not be a DBG bus planned. I know there's not yet, but I'm unsure if its in the works. Also, while there's nothing specific released yet, the Houston trip on May 1st is a go for DBG. I'm assuming there will be a bus, but I have no confirmation."

fcdallas,2zwwcw,SignalFire27,16,Sun Mar 22 16:13:26 2015 UTC,Because FC Dallas is marketed to families and families don't get loud.
fcdallas,2zwwcw,mtrain123,7,Sun Mar 22 17:16:27 2015 UTC,Families suck
fcdallas,2zwwcw,last_strip_of_bacon,3,Mon Mar 23 00:24:15 2015 UTC,that's what happens when you put your stadium in suburbia
fcdallas,2zwwcw,envican,5,Mon Mar 23 18:03:53 2015 UTC,"I think this is the biggest shame about our team's business strategy. On one hand, being in Frisco probably gives the team a lot of bonuses from the city and I'm sure they're raking in the money with the youth setup, but everyone knows if the stadium was in Dallas proper we would pull a much bigger urban population that was there for sport and not a family outing."
fcdallas,2zwwcw,clutchy42,2,Mon Mar 23 22:36:46 2015 UTC,I wish they returned to the Cotton Bowl
fcdallas,2zwwcw,last_strip_of_bacon,3,Mon Mar 23 23:47:15 2015 UTC,"that would be awesome since DART rail runs to that area. Not having public transportation go to the stadium is dumb, imo."
fcdallas,2zwwcw,envican,2,Wed Mar 25 16:35:20 2015 UTC,This is why I go to considerably more stars games than FC dallas games. :P I'd love to have public transport up to frisco.
fcdallas,2zwwcw,Chiapanacas,2,Wed Mar 25 20:21:16 2015 UTC,"I'd go more often if it was in Dallas proper and I live in FW. Frisco is just not that easily accessible for all of DFW, considering most people don't feel it's worth driving an hour one way for a 2 hour soccer game they can watch on TV."
fcdallas,2zwwcw,envican,1 point,Wed Mar 25 16:37:07 2015 UTC,"Yet that doesn't seem to make a difference with Kansas City, or even NY Red Bulls to an extent. Colorado is fairly close to the city core & so is Columbus."
fcdallas,2zwwcw,WhoAteMyPizza,1 point,Tue Mar 31 19:47:22 2015 UTC,"Toyota Stadium is further from the city core of Dallas than all of the teams you listed, and over twice the distance from Fort Worth as the other stadiums."
fcdallas,2zwwcw,envican,1 point,Tue Mar 31 21:21:32 2015 UTC,"Toyota Stadium is further from downtown Dallas, but NYRB is definitely farther from Manhattan. My point with Columbus & Colorado is that they are closer to the city core than Dallas is, but we arguably have better support.  Kansas City used to have a great location compared to its urban core but had pitiful support. Probably the absolute worst year after year. It took HSG dumping them to owners who gave a damn to actually build them to what they are now. They play next to an outlet mall, a Great Wolf Lodge, and the NASCAR track 20 minutes outside of downtown, and further from the majority of the population that lives on the Missouri side. Hardly the environment that leads to 30 straight sellouts (or whatever the number is).   I don't really love Frisco, but it's okay. I'm just sort of tired of it being used as some excuse for attendance. If you build the right environment and use the right marketing, people will come up the tollway no matter where they live."
fcdallas,2zwwcw,WhoAteMyPizza,1 point,Tue Mar 31 21:33:22 2015 UTC,"Red Bull Arena is closer to Manhattan than Toyota Stadium is to Dallas. I agree that distance is not the end all be all that many people claim it to be (and I have on occasion, but I also live 50+ miles from it  while also still living in the Metroplex), but given the distance most people are probably only going to come to the big games. If the train went to the stadium I'm sure that would help, but good luck getting Frisco to allow public transportation on that level."
fcdallas,2zwwcw,envican,1 point,Tue Mar 31 21:41:39 2015 UTC,and some families don't get loud.  FTFY.
fcdallas,2zwwcw,WalkingHumble,1 point,Wed Mar 25 03:33:03 2015 UTC,"In speaking with a marketing employee at FC Dallas this isn't necessarily true. Sure they have promos that attract families, but they've been gradually moving to millennials. Think recent pub crawls, promos downtown, and promoting the beer garden. Unfortunately it's probably just the location of suburbia isn't super conducive to a young crowd."
fcdallas,2zwwcw,jiveturkey38,2,Sat Mar 28 23:55:06 2015 UTC,Yeah my comment was mainly based on the location of the stadium.
fcdallas,2zwwcw,mtrain123,7,Sun Mar 29 00:07:20 2015 UTC,There are more families with young kids than there are fans wanting to be load and chant loudly the whole game.
fcdallas,2zwwcw,FCDallasBurn,6,Sun Mar 22 19:07:13 2015 UTC,"First step, join in with the Deep in the Heart of Texas with the supporters groups at the 36 minute mark. You'll hear a trumpet start it off. It's not the answer to being rowdy, but if we can get enough behind it we can show the rest of the stadium what an incredible atmosphere the stadium can be if we're in full voice."
fcdallas,2zwwcw,jahoki,1 point,Mon Mar 23 04:21:54 2015 UTC,I heard about it before a game and I was prepared to join in but I couldn't find where it was and I thought I'd just wait and listen for it but I never heard a peep of it
fcdallas,2zwwcw,Elguapo361,5,Tue Mar 24 17:52:41 2015 UTC,I don't know what you're talking about.  The place erupted when we scored against SKC.  Granted we don't have a stadium full of chants at all times. I'd rather watch the game.
fcdallas,2zwwcw,clutchy42,3,Sun Mar 22 19:43:43 2015 UTC,I think there's probably a lot of people with the impression that you cannot do both. I'm in the beer garden every game singing my heart out and I never miss a second of action. The only people who really suffer are those troopers leading the chants who often have their backs to the pitch.
fcdallas,2zwwcw,Elguapo361,2,Mon Mar 23 22:34:26 2015 UTC,"That's fine, but frankly the singing doesn't appeal to me. I like to sit, enjoy the game, jump out of my seat when build up happen, and scream like crazy when we score.   Occasionally join in on a chant, especially if we have a comfortable lead toward the end of the game.  My kids have a great time screaming their heads off too, but apparently as a family, we suck and we're doing it wrong."
fcdallas,2zwwcw,clutchy42,2,Mon Mar 23 22:54:55 2015 UTC,"To each their own. I wouldn't take too much offense to the family remarks. The issue isn't that families are interested - the issue is that the FO markets almost solely to this demographic. Which is for the most part a flaky or fair weathered bunch. This is in no way saying that's how you or your family are, but the attendance during inclement weather or form slumps is rather telling with regards to most families.   Edit: To add to that. The fact that you're on a tiny subreddit for the club discussing our team tells me that you are in fact a different breed then most. And kudos to you for that dedication and care!"
fcdallas,2zwwcw,Elguapo361,4,Mon Mar 23 23:15:48 2015 UTC,"I hear ya, and I'm not offended, I just think there's room for both aspects of the fandom at the games.  Thing is, families may not be super rowdy like the supporter groups, but they are butts in the seats. Its the people not bothering to come out to the games that are the problem.  We are currently at the top of the supporters shield rankings, but have one of the lowest attendance averages in the league so far. That is embarrassing."
fcdallas,2zwwcw,envican,1 point,Tue Mar 24 01:36:03 2015 UTC,"Considering how many people live in Frisco, that city alone should be able to get it mostly filled."
fcdallas,2zwwcw,lg_3000,6,Wed Mar 25 16:44:59 2015 UTC,I wonder the same thing. I know the Beer Guardians have chants and are loud the whole match. It would be nice if more supporters groups sat closer together to make it super loud.
fcdallas,2zwwcw,HealthHazard,3,Sun Mar 22 22:16:36 2015 UTC,I thought the same exact thing. Reading the responses i forgot that not everyone likes to jump and chant all the time. I was thinking if we could combine the Matadors and the group next to the Beer Gardens with the smoke bombs ( I don't know if the have a name) I think that could get the atmosphere up
fcdallas,2zwwcw,NF3RN0,1 point,Tue Mar 24 00:30:31 2015 UTC,They are Dallas Football Elite.
fcdallas,2zwwcw,envican,5,Wed Mar 25 11:43:32 2015 UTC,Don't other stadiums have people leading the chants on every section? I know that we do not have something like that. Also we need to start selling out the stadium. Start bring more people to games! Tickets are reasonably priced. I hope we can get close to a sell out game Saturday against Seattle.
fcdallas,2zwwcw,NF3RN0,4,Sun Mar 22 22:19:22 2015 UTC,"I'll be at the game Saturday with a bunch of friends, and I bet it'll be better attended since it's against Seattle. Just a shame that so many players will be away playing international friendlies."
fcdallas,2zwwcw,envican,2,Mon Mar 23 18:06:10 2015 UTC,Who will be out for Dallas?
fcdallas,2zwwcw,IDontLikeAnyofYall,3,Mon Mar 23 19:48:09 2015 UTC,"I'm under the impression that Moises Hernandez, Blas Perez, Kyle Bekker, Je-Vaughn Watson, and Atiba Harris all have international friendlies this weekend"
fcdallas,2zwwcw,envican,2,Mon Mar 23 20:05:49 2015 UTC,That's a fucking bummer. I didn't even think about internationals not being there. I wonder how many players Seattle will be missing.
fcdallas,2zwwcw,clutchy42,1 point,Mon Mar 23 20:32:48 2015 UTC,"yeah, I'm sad about that as well, just hope it's a good game. I know Dempsey will be gone, as well as Pappa"

fcdallas,2zwwcw,hobbs2112,1 point,Thu Mar 26 13:10:42 2015 UTC,Yeah they should move around from sideline to sideline and endline to endline throughout the game.

fcdallas,2zvqxg,clutchy42,8,Sun Mar 22 05:55:03 2015 UTC,"MLS: ""Well despite our best wishes FC Dallas win again. We really wanted to put them around the 10 spot, but they have 9 points and well no one else does, again, despite our best wishes. So here we are. FC Dallas is, regrettably, our number 1 team in the week 3 power rankings. I mean, come on, they were up a man against Philly. Even Chivas could win that match. For fucks sake someone get Messi to LA."""
fcdallas,2zvqxg,Rilgon,3,Sun Mar 22 05:56:07 2015 UTC,"I dunno, I felt the comment was pretty accurate? There were errors in our first two games, but we overcame them or they were counterbalanced by even more grievous errors by our opposition.  I think we'll get a real test next weekend. If (when) we beat Seattle, that's when the salt will really flow."
fcdallas,2zvqxg,Rilgon,1 point,Sun Mar 22 06:09:49 2015 UTC,"Errors, sure, but we still took our chances and got the points. On the flipside if you read some of their other ratings you can tell how bad they wanted to put teams like LA and Seattle above us despite events such as San Jose embarrassing Seattle.   You may very well be right and perhaps I read into it a bit much, but I still feel they could have made their comments without coming across so begrudged."
fcdallas,2zvqxg,RedDevilZim13,1 point,Sun Mar 22 14:06:44 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, there's definitely some begrudgement and ""fuck, Dallas is doing really well"" to it, but in the end when you strip that away, their thesis is such:  ""Dallas made errors, but it didn't matter - right now, they're the best there is in the league, and thus they're number 1 in the power rankings"".  Which is true. :D"
fcdallas,2zugpe,clutchy42,5,Sat Mar 21 21:59:58 2015 UTC,I hope we avoid the same pattern we've had the last few years where we start out really hot then do miserable in the middle and finish strong. Would like to see us be consistent throughout.   Off to a great start! DTID!
fcdallas,2zugpe,soundthealarm21,2,Sat Mar 21 22:18:18 2015 UTC,"You can pinpoint the moment we dipped last year with the game in DC where Diaz went off early due to his injury that then kept him out most of the season. He even scored in that game before coming off and was looking like a real architect prior to the injury.  This season he's there, but hasn't been necessarily the single creator as our front 3-4 players are all moving together really well.  Diaz did come off today kinda reaching at his hamstring, but hopefully we got him off in time and it's nothing. DTID!"
fcdallas,2zugpe,BigOHeadphones,2,Sat Mar 21 22:22:41 2015 UTC,"I'm hoping he was just a little winded and cramping up a bit, because he didn't look like he was in a pulled hamstring kind of pain."
fcdallas,2zugpe,soundthealarm21,3,Sat Mar 21 22:33:41 2015 UTC,"Oscar pulled him off after 60 minutes against SKC. I think he's just not match fit yet, although I didn't see the game today (can't believe it wasn't on tv) and didn't see he was grabbing a hammy or anything."

fcdallas,2yty6b,soundthealarm21,1 point,Fri Mar 13 19:23:58 2015 UTC,That's silly he got suspended for that.  Somewhat unrelated but - it was awesome at the end of the match all the FCD players (and this coach) were doing everything they could to keep the game going. There was even one point that San Jose had a free kick in our half and our players ran and grabbed the ball and placed it for them. Shows how confident we were in winning that match.
fcdallas,2yty6b,PirateMushroom,1 point,Thu Mar 12 20:57:16 2015 UTC,Agreed.  I don't get the reasoning behind it.  If anything this would've benefited San Jose.  I'm not really sure why the disciplinary committee didn't let this slide.
fcdallas,2yovps,TheWrightMatt,2,Wed Mar 11 16:18:53 2015 UTC,"This is not an answer for our right back issue. I was not a big fan of his last season in that position or in general. Too many boneheaded giveaways. I just want a real right back. Not some experiment. A step up from Harris, but really most anyone is."
fcdallas,2yovps,satellitebob,4,Wed Mar 11 16:35:24 2015 UTC,We have one. He's playing center back.
fcdallas,2yovps,HealthHazard,1 point,Thu Mar 12 02:14:02 2015 UTC,"Agreed, I don't like him at RB, but I think he flourishes at RM/RW. For his age and size he is remarkably fast.  Admittedly everyone agrees Harris was underwhelming as RB vs San Jose. Hopefully he either improves or we can put Loyd back at RB and  Zimmerman can step up or Keel recovers quickly.  So in terms of depth, I think it's smart to re-sign him. He shouldn't be first choice RB, but if Loyd or Harris are hurt we'll be glad he's there to fill in."
fcdallas,2yovps,b0xors,1 point,Wed Mar 11 17:08:13 2015 UTC,"I do like Harris and Watson as options off the bench.   I'd be happy with Acosta at right back. I know his preferred position is in the midfield, but don't think he's beating Ulloa or Diaz out."
fcdallas,2ylmjz,PDJ825,8,Tue Mar 10 20:47:01 2015 UTC,Gosh i hope Watson wasn't our big signing....
fcdallas,2ylmjz,tejanokiller,3,Thu Mar 12 05:53:57 2015 UTC,No. Did you forget what club you supported? Big signing at FCD? Good luck.
fcdallas,2ylmjz,WhoAteMyPizza,2,Wed Mar 11 14:19:01 2015 UTC,"I haven't heard anything. For what it's worth, we've already got 3 designated players so if they know something we don't, it's probably not going to be headline news.  EDIT: I might be wrong - we might only have 2 designated players. See discussion below."
fcdallas,2ylmjz,powersnake,2,Tue Mar 10 22:16:46 2015 UTC,We only have to DPs. David Texeria and Mauro Diaz
fcdallas,2ylmjz,lofiBathSalts,2,Tue Mar 10 23:38:19 2015 UTC,This page says that Castillo is also a DP. Is it wrong?
fcdallas,2ylmjz,powersnake,3,Tue Mar 10 23:47:41 2015 UTC,"I believe that us wrong as it does not say he is a DP on the FC Dallas page or the FCD wiki page. Also from what I read about his new contract, he was not made a DP."
fcdallas,2ylmjz,lofiBathSalts,2,Tue Mar 10 23:54:14 2015 UTC,"I see. Hopefully you're right, and maybe we have a big signing on the way."
fcdallas,2ylmjz,powersnake,2,Wed Mar 11 00:08:09 2015 UTC,Castillo is what's called a Young DP because he is under 23. Young DPs do not count against the DP limit.
fcdallas,2ylmjz,Medoingreddit,2,Wed Mar 11 07:48:29 2015 UTC,"Course they do - Young DP, old DP it doesn't matter. You can only have 3. Young DP's just count as less towards the salary cap than a DP older than 23."
fcdallas,2ylmjz,ScOrPiOn37,1 point,Wed Mar 11 16:42:29 2015 UTC,"From the DP wiki: Clubs will not have to buy the third DP roster slot to accommodate Designated Players 23 years old and younger.  Edit: but I guess that means that they would just not have to pay the tax to add a third DP. I don't know, I'm confused."
fcdallas,2ylmjz,Medoingreddit,2,Wed Mar 11 19:47:37 2015 UTC,Yeah the first 2 DP spots are free. the 3rd DP slot a club can buy for something stupid like $250k or something. That DP tax is then split and shared among all other teams that don't have 3 DPs and goes towards their allocation money.  If your 3rd DP is a young DP you don't pay that fee for the 3rd slot. It was a stupid rule the MLS did to try and encourage clubs to sign the next big thing instead of the big things.
fcdallas,2ylmjz,ScOrPiOn37,3,Wed Mar 11 20:15:32 2015 UTC,Whenever they signed Castillo to a new deal they said that they didn't use a DP spot for him so we only have two so far
fcdallas,2ylmjz,Draecon,2,Wed Mar 11 01:15:54 2015 UTC,"No sir, you did not hear wrong. I heard the exact same thing you mentioned.

fcdallas,2yl3q3,jahoki,2,Tue Mar 10 18:37:51 2015 UTC,the secret to attendance seems to be the signing of world cup player. not just villa or kaka or gerrard but even a usa star like dempsy or Mix. yea hedges got a few minutes at the end of a friendly and he's a good player but we need a big name. unfortunately those are expensive.
fcdallas,2yl3q3,tejanokiller,1 point,Thu Mar 12 05:09:38 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty disappointed in our attendance. Especially with this being the opening game.

fcdallas,2yl3q3,RedDevilZim13,1 point,Wed Mar 11 15:06:08 2015 UTC,"The team was pretty successful last year, but honestly, for one of the original 10 teams, and one outfitted by HSG, part of me feels like making the playoffs should be a minimum expectation every season. We went out of the Open Cup early (ish), and the first (real) round of the playoffs. While that is a great season compared to the last few years, to the casual fan who hasn't followed MLS, odds are that isn't an impressive enough resume to get them excited to try it.  Add to that the philosophy of ""trust us, our players are awesome. I know you haven't heard of them, but it's still totally worth spending your money to see them"". Oh and the front office's far over-inflated sense of what their product is worth to the average joe on the street resulting in ticket increases this year.  Dallas is a town that likes winners, and teams who look like they're doing everything they can to win. There is too much other sport in this town for people who don't already love soccer blindly to support mediocrity."

fcdallas,2yb43a,fantasyMLShelper,2,Sun Mar 8 04:18:58 2015 UTC,"Such a payoff for the first match of the season. Concerned about our back line situation because Atiba Harris was dreadful, but we won so whatevs!"
fcdallas,2yb43a,clutchy42,3,Sun Mar 8 05:27:37 2015 UTC,"Harris definitely had a bad day, but I think the whole back line did. Hedges had a few bad giveaways, Loyd got beat badly on some aerial balls, and Hernandez barely held together on the left side. Wondo, Salinas and MPG are a potent attack. Give us a few games together and we'll solidify."
fcdallas,2yb43a,huskydefender55,2,Sun Mar 8 18:27:15 2015 UTC,"I think you may be right, but sub in Acosta for Harris."
fcdallas,2yb43a,mybrotherhasabbgun,1 point,Sun Mar 8 19:09:06 2015 UTC,"I agree. It was a bad day for our backline, but we've seen Hedges run the show and the same for Loyd. Moises is still getting his first team feet wet and will come good from what we've seen.  Harris is a journeyman though. He barely ever spends more than a season with a team because he isn't worth keeping. He fills a hole for a season and then he's off to the next team. I'd really feel more comfortable if he was just a backup, but it looks like he's getting the start. My negativity aside. I hope he shines and our backline shores everything up."
fcdallas,2yb43a,clutchy42,2,Mon Mar 9 00:08:47 2015 UTC,"Don't forget, Watson's contract is still under negotiation. There's a chance he could come back and then he definitely starts over Harris. I'd rather put Acosta at CDM, where he prefers to play. We're definitely short on depth in the center of the park, and if (God forbid) Castillo goes down..."
fcdallas,2yb43a,huskydefender55,1 point,Mon Mar 9 00:13:07 2015 UTC,"Good point. I kinda like Watson on the wing, but having him at RB would make me feel way more comfortable. Something else. Was Loyd always a CB that Hyndman had moonlighting on the right? His sudden switch to the center last season caught me off guard, but he's very good at it. Just odd because I always thought he was a natural fullback."
fcdallas,2yb43a,clutchy42,1 point,Mon Mar 9 00:22:42 2015 UTC,"He is a natural full back. We only put him at center there last season because Keel, Zimmerman, Cabrera, and John were all injured. I've always thought his reading of the game is spectacular, and he has the pace to cover behind Hedges whenever Matt steps up out of the defense (which he definitely likes to do)."
fcdallas,2yb43a,huskydefender55,1 point,Mon Mar 9 00:26:58 2015 UTC,"Just watching the replay of the match and this is unrelated to the goal, but why didn't Dan Kennedy start?  They had him listed as starting GK during the pregame on CSN.  Do you guys anticipate him starting at all?  Edit: Never mind.  Found my answer here:   There was a chance that Dan Kennedy, who came to Dallas through the Chivas USA dispersal draft, could have made his FCD debut in goal. However, Kennedy missed some practice time last week while serving in his role on the MLS Players Union executive board."

fcdallas,2yazs2,Krodins,2,Sun Mar 8 03:43:53 2015 UTC,"How tall is Loyd?   Last season I thought he was playing there due to George John being injured, but it seems to be permanent. Credit to him because he's held his own there quite well."
fcdallas,2yazs2,VivaIslamico,1 point,Sun Mar 8 03:49:58 2015 UTC,"5'9. He has played great there and his height has not really been tested much, so that hasn't been a problem. I'd still like to get a traditional CB back there, like Zimmerman, but we may be better off with Loyd at CB."
fcdallas,2yazs2,soundthealarm21,2,Sun Mar 8 04:22:53 2015 UTC,I think I like Loyd at RB and then the best / healthiest of Zimmerman or Keel in the center.  How far away is Keel?
fcdallas,2yazs2,mybrotherhasabbgun,3,Sun Mar 8 17:05:29 2015 UTC,Completely deserved. Can't believe we were about to walk away from there without three points!! So many chances to put it away.

fcdallas,2yazs2,Medoingreddit,1 point,Mon Mar 9 15:30:32 2015 UTC,"They're typically more expensive. I imagine partially because they're mostly shaded in the summer. Also it prolly helps that the camera is on that side, so they can avoid showing crowd shots with big missing patches."

I've always thought Houston had a better Austin fanbase than FCD, but I was pleasantly surprised to see the pro-FCD turnout for the ATX pro challenge.

fcdallas,2yacje,VivaIslamico,3,Sun Mar 8 16:56:44 2015 UTC,"MLS Live is your option.  In Austin you won't be subject to any of the blackout stuff for FCD games.  Only downside is that if MLS Live has a choice between the FCD broadcast and the away team broadcast, they ALMOST ALWAYS choose the other team.  By the end of the season you will be pretty well qualified to offer an opinion on which team's announcers are the biggest homers."

fcdallas,2y7l31,FCDallasBurn,4,Sat Mar 7 05:38:06 2015 UTC,Because the hunts are cheap pieces of shit. They probably got a discount on flash seats. I hope they sell soon.
fcdallas,2y7l31,HealthHazard,5,Sat Mar 7 06:10:50 2015 UTC,I had to avoid all those threads where people were showing off their season ticket packages. The only thing we get is a coupon book and they can't even do that right.. They won't be ready for another week or two.
fcdallas,2y7l31,Jimla,5,Sat Mar 7 15:13:24 2015 UTC,"And can we talk about how the ""included"" USMNT tickets cost an extra $80 each?"
fcdallas,2y7l31,Jimla,1 point,Sat Mar 7 15:14:27 2015 UTC,With the seats that I bought it was only an extra $50 for the Gold Cup tickets. I also did buy mine in a supporters section so that's probably why.

I thought last year there was a package to get a Diaz jersey with it, but this year it didn't sound like he got anything. And the flash seats app is convenient at the gate, but kind of annoying since it requires extra steps to sell on stubhub. With all the money that went into calling me, texting me, and emailing me about season tickets, it would've been nice to see season ticket packages with gifts and legitimate discounts. I might have been more willing to buy my own package early in the off season if it came with a voucher to receive the new jersey on it's release or something."

I spoke to a ticket representative last Friday about this and he said as far he knew that it would be available again this season. It was a huge reason why I decided to buy a season ticket for the first time since I live all the way out in NW Fort Worth and don't know anyone else with season tickets. This blows!
fcdallas,2xv4ox,MaverickTTT,4,Wed Mar 4 18:24:38 2015 UTC,"This is precisely why I didn't buy a season package.  We're a one-car family who strives to be a no-car family by using public & alternative transportation wherever we can (writing this from DART rail).  Not a big fan of driving anywhere that requires paying the NTTA anything...and the bus was a great way to make the games without having to worry about having a few drinks, too.

fcdallas,2xsx15,Jimla,2,Tue Mar 3 21:49:32 2015 UTC,They'll go on single game sale probably in April if I had to guess. With it being the opener you'll definitely wanna get in on any sort of presale or as soon as they make the announcement. It's bound to sell out.
fcdallas,2xsx15,WhoAteMyPizza,1 point,Tue Mar 3 17:40:45 2015 UTC,Will there be better presale options other then buying season tickets? I would like to go but I live too far away to be a season ticket holder. I only make 4-5 games a season.

fcdallas,2x51p8,pumasplayer7,6,Wed Feb 25 18:48:21 2015 UTC,"If you are leaning towards El Matador then just stop by the tail gate before the game on the east side of the stadium.  Simply walk up and grab some food and drink and someone will spark up a conversation with you and you will be welcomed right away.  El Matador is truly an organic group and all about having a good time while being as loud as possible at the game.  The group isn't as big currently as some of the others... but it's definitely growing and they have some very passionate people running the group.  Plus the season tickets in 117 are very inexpensive.    Myself and several others that subscribe to /r/fcdallas will be hanging out with El Matador at just about every tailgate this year so stop by and visit!  You can always ""try it before you buy it"" with any supporter group."
fcdallas,2x51p8,devish,3,Wed Feb 25 22:16:52 2015 UTC,The low ticket prices for that section are definitely a big plus for me since I'm a recent college grad and don't have a lot of extra cash. And I would like to hang out with them for a game or two before I commit but I want to take advantage of the current special discount that they have for El Matador supporters before it ends at the end of this month. No matter what I decide to do I'll be sure to hit you at a tailgate this season!
fcdallas,2x51p8,ur6ci124q,2,Thu Feb 26 00:57:23 2015 UTC,I hang out in the Beer Garden but I agree that El Matador is very accepting of newcomers. They are friendly as hell and throw confetti around after goals and stuff. I'm not sure about chants but they are loud with instruments and are constantly making noise. Much respect!
fcdallas,2x51p8,Abeck2284,4,Thu Feb 26 04:16:34 2015 UTC,"I'm a proudly a member of El Matador. For us not being as big as some of the other groups, we are definantly one of the loudest.  The drums playing are our own fans, not the front office drum line.  We had a huge increase in membership past season, mostly due to the atmosphere we provide in the stands.  Many of our chants are in spanish, however we do many english chants too."

fcdallas,2x51p8,lg_3000,4,Wed Feb 25 19:35:45 2015 UTC,El Matador is by far the loudest section in the stadium.
fcdallas,2x51p8,dobetterthanthat,2,Wed Feb 25 19:32:32 2015 UTC,"That's what I'm basically looking for. To be in the loudest, most involved group."
fcdallas,2x51p8,Yek0p,2,Wed Feb 25 20:03:26 2015 UTC,Loud because they play drums and such the whole time. Beer Garden chants more
fcdallas,2x51p8,dobetterthanthat,3,Wed Feb 25 23:05:45 2015 UTC,El Matador does chant the whole time but it is hard to hear because of the drums. As the group grows hopefully the songs will be easier to hear.
fcdallas,2x51p8,HealthHazard,1 point,Thu Feb 26 15:12:07 2015 UTC,I know they can't and I wasn't saying the drums are a bad thing. Just pointing out that they are loudest because of the drums

fcdallas,2x51p8,lg_3000,3,Fri Feb 27 21:06:57 2015 UTC,"I would agree that the stadium atmosphere is non-existent except for scoring plays.  But, not matter where I sit in the stadium El Matador is the SG I always hear.  Sure, it's probably because of the constant drums.  But, by the mid-part of the second half the section in 105 has mostly died out.  And I don't really hear much coming from the beer garden section.  It would be nice if there where some chants and songs that involved the whole stadium.  How hard would it be to create a song to the tune of ""Deep In The Heart of Texas?""  But, the hard part would be getting people to get involved.  That part is usually easier with libations."

fcdallas,2wvrk7,TheWrightMatt,1 point,Mon Feb 23 16:17:55 2015 UTC,"I have really high hopes for Dan. This is a great opportunity for him to show why he is so highly regarded even on a shit team like Chivas.  Even though we had such a good season last year, it was a bit aggravating not having a solid starting keeper week in and week out, just going back and forth between Chris and Raul.    The biggest hiccup could be our RB but hopefully Harris embraces the opportunity.   I can't wait to see how well our defense does in front of him with two strong leaders, Hedges and Dan, both running the back line. I think Dan is a great pick up and really adds strength to our already strong squad."

fcdallas,2wd1da,Episcapagan,3,Wed Feb 18 22:19:21 2015 UTC,The way I understand it is you don't have to use the app - you can use a card (credit card / DL) that you associate with the account and they will swipe it at the gate (some people do not own a smartphone so that makes sense).  The app is very easy to use though.    You can transfer your tickets to someone else via the ticket website.  No idea about the canes though.  I don't know if that relationship is even still in existence this season.  Guess we'll see.
fcdallas,2wd1da,jaw0012,2,Thu Feb 19 02:52:47 2015 UTC,"I can't answer anything else, but:   And how do we redeem them for our free Canes chicken?   When you scan your QR code or your credit card that the tickets are on, you get a seat locator slip that shows you where you're sitting - I imagine that would work just as well as a ticket for free Canes."
fcdallas,2wd1da,Rilgon,1 point,Wed Feb 18 23:14:19 2015 UTC,Seems legit!
fcdallas,2wd1da,IDontLikeAnyofYall,1 point,Wed Feb 18 23:17:49 2015 UTC,Hey man. So we use these at mavs games too with season tickets. They will scan your QR and however many tickets you have will print from the machine on the attendants belt. Its easy. You can use a card as others said too. Just make sure you set it up on your flash seats account.   You'll see its not that bad.
fcdallas,2wc0cv,TheWrightMatt,5,Wed Feb 18 17:55:23 2015 UTC,This makes me so excited. Can't wait for the season to start.  Shit i can't wait until Friday for preseason even.

fcdallas,2vo6a1,lg_3000,6,Thu Feb 12 17:37:53 2015 UTC,I think its because of there are a lot of families with young kids and also because the soccer culture isn't too big here
fcdallas,2vo6a1,FCDallasBurn,7,Thu Feb 12 22:46:45 2015 UTC,"Fuck the Timbers!  (sorry husband is from Seattle, so the Timbers are evil to me, and the Sounders, but only when we play them)  Come to the Beer Garden, the fans there are loud all the time, however it's only a 21+ crowd.    My opinion on the matter is that soccer down here is still a growing sport.  Our fan base is growing and with the growth of the fan base so also will the noise, or so we hope."
fcdallas,2vo6a1,murm87,5,Thu Feb 12 18:58:06 2015 UTC,Don't wake the vuvuzelas.
fcdallas,2vo6a1,huskydefender55,2,Fri Feb 13 00:19:02 2015 UTC,"I think you're onto something, with the Cowboys analogy. I've lived in Dallas for most of my life, outside of college years, but Dallas stadiums are the quietest I've been in. It's something that sports writers have brought up for decades, and unfortunately might not ever change. That being said, a major issue is just how empty the stadium is during matches. If more people go, at the least the loud moments can be louder. We'll probably never see Portland or Seattle game-long singing, but at least it could give a home field advantage."
fcdallas,2vo6a1,lifeinminor,1 point,Thu Feb 19 09:02:36 2015 UTC,"The good thing is attendance goes up every year.  So, in a few years the place could be packed."

fcdallas,2vg4l1,FCDallasguy,9,Tue Feb 10 19:20:37 2015 UTC,"I'm not a season ticket holder but I consider myself much more than a casual fan. I attend several games a season and watch all the others on MLS Live.   You say you want to compete with attendances like Seattle, Portland, Kansas, etc., if I could just make a few suggestions:  Please stop selling the vuvuzelas. I know that it's a very family friendly atmosphere and those are mainly for the kids, but in my personal opinion, they are very annoying. I get tired of hearing them in the stands and having them blare in my ear and I know I'm not the only one. This leads me to believe that anyone that doesn't really follow the team but maybe sees them playing and decides to tune in occasionally might also be turned off by the blaring horns. Anytime I tune into an FC Dallas match thread there are always several comments about the vuvuzelas so I know lots of people share this opinion.  Also, I know in one of Dan Hunt's Facebook Q&A's he addressed adding shade to the stadium. I was wondering if there was any progress with it. We all know the Texas heat in the season can be unforgiving at times. I also know there's only so much that can be done post-construction of the stadium.  I, personally, think that the blue wall surrounding the stadium is rather bland. Maybe the fans could bring more banners and stuff to hang but I think the club itself could do something with it. Maybe a flags of the world mural or something along those lines. Just an idea of mine.  I'm just making suggestions based on my personal experiences.   TL:DR Dallas Til I Die!"
fcdallas,2vg4l1,Draecon,2,Tue Feb 10 21:08:23 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the feedback.  It really does help!    As for the stadium shading, I wouldn't know.  I really just handle the ticket side.  You'll have to ask Dan!    As for the vuvuzelas, we're not planning to do the free vuvuzela night again.  I don't know if we plan to sell them in the stores or not.    Thanks for the comment."

fcdallas,2vg4l1,NF3RN0,1 point,Wed Feb 11 06:25:02 2015 UTC,Is there a difference between Beer Garden seats and Beer Garden Field Seats or are they one in the same?
fcdallas,2vg4l1,lg_3000,2,Tue Feb 10 22:48:58 2015 UTC,"Sort of...    The Beer Garden Field Seats are the bleachers in front that extend almost fully onto the pitch.  Those seats are reserved (or supposed to be reserved) for specific tickets to those stands.  The Beer Garden is the patio space behind those bleachers.  Fans over 21 can go onto the Beer Garden freely, but only into the BG Field Seats if they have a ticket down there.  Those bleachers are expanding, as well."
fcdallas,2vg4l1,totspur1982,1 point,Tue Feb 10 23:58:00 2015 UTC,I've always wondered why the West side of the stadium is always either 1/4 or 1/2 full when the rest of the stadium is mostly full.  Is it because you're offering deals on tickets to get the East side/end line seats filled?  I noticed it the most during the playoff game.  It made me think you guys wanted the stadium to look full in the seats you could see on camera.
fcdallas,2vg4l1,TylerGuest1,1 point,Thu Feb 12 17:32:51 2015 UTC,"Just FYI, as a STH, avid soccer fan the ticket trade days go a long way.

fcdallas,2vg4l1,IDontLikeAnyofYall,1 point,Mon Feb 16 01:13:51 2015 UTC,My only suggestion for the club would be to somehow expand TV viewership as well as what everyone else has been saying. A lot of people don't have MLS Live or Time Warner Cable in order to watch the games. I know people who want to watch the games on TV when they can't make it to the games. Are there any updates on that front?
fcdallas,2vc295,TheWrightMatt,2,Mon Feb 9 20:09:01 2015 UTC,Awesome to see us take this step. With our youth development it's surprising it took as long as it did.
fcdallas,2vc295,soundthealarm21,5,Mon Feb 9 20:11:43 2015 UTC,I wish we could've actually gotten a second team though. FCD2 would be ideal especially since we have the practice facilities for a second team.
fcdallas,2vc295,TheLastBison,3,Mon Feb 9 21:54:51 2015 UTC,"Dan Hunt said that they were wanting to do that next year. I really hope they do.  The academy is one of the best in the league, if not the best. That's a great thing to have, especially with the lack of big-money signings. But if everyone else is getting reserve teams before us, we'll fall behind."

fcdallas,2tklkt,ur6ci124q,1 point,Sun Jan 25 15:10:59 2015 UTC,"That's a shame. My wife and I have been DBG season tix holders for 3 years now (its an unbeatable atmosphere in a stadium that isn't exactly raucous.) As for season ticket perks they usually send out a book of coupons that range from a free meal to something discounted at the shop. the best thing I have gotten in previous years has been the incentive item for renewal such as a cheaply made scarf and then this past year we received lanyards for renewing.   The year before last, season ticket holders were given a David Ferreira bobblehead during a specific game. My group was fairly excited about it, but when we opened them it was comical. Mine looked like the paint was applied by a person with tremors. My roommate's head fell off after a few days. None of them really... bobbled. It was actually pretty funny in hindsight.  So I wouldn't expect too much when it comes to incentives outside of saving money on the tickets.  On a final note, if they continue as they have in past years the actual bleacher seating in the Beer Garden is treated as general admission, so anyone can actually go down into the section. I'd suggest convincing your fiance to try it out for a game. The folks toward the east end of the bleachers tend to sit more and join in less on the chants, but those of us toward the right end and the actual DBG members are in full voice (when the Front Offices drumline isn't drowning us out at least).  Edit: Editing"
fcdallas,2tklkt,murm87,3,Sun Jan 25 15:46:11 2015 UTC,"If I go with a buddy or a friend I usually go to the Gardens, but when she goes she likes to have an actual seat. It's not a big deal to me really.  I just heard that a couple years ago they were giving STH free MLS Live accounts. Don't know if this is still ongoing or not."
fcdallas,2tklkt,clutchy42,1 point,Sun Jan 25 18:30:03 2015 UTC,"They did this last season, not sure about this season."
fcdallas,2tklkt,murm87,3,Sun Jan 25 19:39:41 2015 UTC,"From what I have been told by security in the beer garden the bleachers are for season ticket holders only.  For games when the bleachers aren't packed security will let GA in, but if you are in someones seats, you have to move."
fcdallas,2tklkt,ur6ci124q,1 point,Mon Jan 26 21:15:38 2015 UTC,"I believe that's correct, but considering most games the bleachers aren't overflowing they're probably lenient on it. Either way, I haven't personally had to deal with fighting for a seat. We may end up having to sit a little further from the DBG than we'd like, but the spots are usually there."
fcdallas,2tklkt,HaiFriends,3,Mon Jan 26 22:18:51 2015 UTC,True.  Guess you just have to find a security guard who will let GA get through.  We used to go in and sit no problem and then security started cracking down and made sure to check all tickets so only STH could get through.  But now that we have season tickets for in there I'm not worrying about it this year :)
fcdallas,2tklkt,capez,1 point,Mon Jan 26 22:22:54 2015 UTC,Last year the season ticket booklet included a few buy get one free ticket coupons as well as some 1/2 price ticket coupons. I used those to invite friends who had never been before and they loved being in the Beer Garden.

fcdallas,2t1o3t,IDontLikeAnyofYall,2,Tue Jan 20 12:53:26 2015 UTC,"I don't get it, our guys barely made it through the season. We had a lot of mid-season injuries, and we are going to roll out the same roster. I imagine that the guys we let go  that are coming back are just waiting on the CBA, but even that's grim. I think Watson will make a decent RB, but who is going to be paired at DM with Ulloa? Thomas maybe, but he's coming off major surgery. Acosta's injury forced him out WC qualifying. I don't know, I'm very nervous. They had a good season, but this team is a ways off from competing with LA and Seattle. I'm just hoping Papi can work his magic with Earle and Hoillett at this point."
fcdallas,2t1o3t,Medoingreddit,2,Tue Jan 20 23:52:34 2015 UTC,Agreed with everything except being as good as Seattle. We were better over two legs. Just got unlucky with away goal rule.
fcdallas,2t1o3t,bstcahill,1 point,Wed Jan 21 03:55:07 2015 UTC,I worry about this all the time.
fcdallas,2s8508,devish,3,Tue Jan 13 00:27:56 2015 UTC,"I'm pumped to see what Pareja can do with this year's draft prospect, but with our low pick and the relative weakness of this year's class, I'm not expecting much.   As for Kljestan, I highly doubt the Hunts will cough up the cash for him, and with the success we've had dipping into the South American pool recently (Diaz, Castillo, Escobar, etc.), I think that'd be a better way to go.  I am a little worried about the CB position though, so I hope we pick up at least one CB, and one CM before the season starts. Thomas back would be nice."
fcdallas,2s8508,huskydefender55,1 point,Tue Jan 13 06:48:24 2015 UTC,"Hunt mentioned after the summer transfer window closed that we tried to sign Sacha and we were close but no deal could be made at that time.  We are alright in the CB, Hedges, Keel, Zimmerman & Lloyd can play there. We need LB cover with the departure of Crazy Eyes and Center Mids - a backup for Diaz's glass ankles - a replacement for Escobar who can keep up with Castillio on breaks (unless this guy is Atiba Harris, or Watson if he gets to play in his preferred RM position) and with the departure of Thomas, Moffat & Luccin & nobody replaced Jacobson's departure back in July. It's making that spot a bit thin on the roster with only really Michel and Uolla there.  As for Keeps we only have Seitz, Kennedy and Gonzales - Raul was let go. So Seitz & Kennedy can fight for starting and Gonzales is decent enough to be 3rd string.  But there's still plenty of time left to make moves, best to expect the draft to be done before we start seeing any real moves from FCD."
fcdallas,2s8508,ScOrPiOn37,2,Tue Jan 13 21:04:56 2015 UTC,"We definitely need some cover for CB. Keel and Zimmerman can play there sure, but aren't quite good enough to be starting all the time. One has the experience but not the skill, and Walker is a project. I agree we could also use a left back, as Moises was pretty inconsistent, and we could use someone to push him. Loyd was phenomenal at CB this season, but we need him on the right as he is miles better than Watson out there. We've got some significant cap space now, I'd like a solid CB pick up to partner Hedges in the starting back 4, or a solid right back so that we can move Loyd in permanently. Also, don't forget Acosta can play DM or either full back if need be. He put in some solid minutes last year."
fcdallas,2s8508,huskydefender55,1 point,Tue Jan 13 21:28:57 2015 UTC,I'm still not on the Acosta is great bandwagon. Scares me more when he's on the field than Watson at RB.  But with all goings on I'm still waiting for Texeira to get the boot and not waste a DP slot and all that cap on a bench warmer. How he's still there and Escobar got the boot still baffles me.
fcdallas,2s8508,ScOrPiOn37,1 point,Tue Jan 13 22:21:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah I can see that. Acosta needs some time on the field in his preferred role (not full back). Preferably alongside a veteran, not Ulloa.   I'm disappointed in Tex too, but Escobar is gone because he was on loan and we couldn't afford to keep him."
fcdallas,2s8508,huskydefender55,1 point,Tue Jan 13 23:05:21 2015 UTC,"Tex was just barely over the max (if i remember correctly), so if the cap/max salary are increased in the new CBA by as much as it seems it will, his deal could be restructured so he is a non-DP?   But as it stands we already have an open DP slot (Escobar), but we don't appear to be in any rush to fill it."
fcdallas,2s8508,RedDevilZim13,1 point,Wed Jan 14 14:11:13 2015 UTC,"Don't need to be in a rush. We have the combine coming up, which is smart to wait for because you never know what could happen or what you get from it."
fcdallas,2s8508,ScOrPiOn37,1 point,Wed Jan 14 17:08:32 2015 UTC,"I struggle to see anybody we pick up with the #15 Pick being of the caliber we need to kick us up to the next level. Sure, we can pick up a good piece, potentially even a starter, but it will be a few years most likely for even the best pick to become a true squad changer. We were a good squad last year, who overachieved a little TBH, and we need to bring in a player who will be a top 5 player (at least) in our squad for us to harbour any real ambition of progressing further than we did last year. This isn't even taking into account the losses of Henry and Escobar, and the strengthening of the Western Conference this offseason."
fcdallas,2s8508,RedDevilZim13,1 point,Wed Jan 14 18:14:18 2015 UTC,"Trades, maybe we trade crazy and come out of it with more cap space or int roster spots etc like we did last year or the year before (can't remember which it was - but we came out best by far with crazy trades) then you know what your working with. There's more to the draft than just picking kids from collage. We all know Papi loves his draft too."
fcdallas,2s8508,ScOrPiOn37,2,Wed Jan 14 19:31:57 2015 UTC,"Yall are all retarded, we dont need another CB, LB or RB. Remember the roster limitations of MLS"
fcdallas,2s8508,Matthew21110,1 point,Tue Jan 20 17:09:11 2015 UTC,I like the idea if he comes to play for the team. I think he is is a good player.
fcdallas,2rvud9,RedDevilZim13,6,Fri Jan 9 19:02:35 2015 UTC,But no Hedges. Ridiculous.
fcdallas,2rvud9,huskydefender55,1 point,Fri Jan 9 19:35:53 2015 UTC,"I heard a rumor this is the beginnings of JK getting an Olympic squad together, and Matty will be too old to be part of that in 2016.. But its puzzling that he isn't getting a call up to camp at least."
fcdallas,2rvud9,huskydefender55,2,Fri Jan 9 19:46:28 2015 UTC,Seems odd that JK wouldn't want to prep for the more important tournament THIS summer... Which Hedges could do great in.

fcdallas,2rvud9,TweetPoster,2,Fri Jan 9 21:17:16 2015 UTC,I disagree. I think having Hedges over some random kid from LA who's barely played a professional minute in his life is a good idea. Hedges can lead a back line. And he had a better year than many of the guys on that list. Maybe I'm just bitter and I felt like this was Matt's best shot at breaking in to the team for any length of time. He'd definitely be a good addition for the Gold Cup.
fcdallas,2rwyas,TathardirErynor,1 point,Sat Jan 10 00:22:57 2015 UTC,Before the season possibly. We have had mid season friendlies against foreign competition since I can remember. So mid season yes pre season maybe.

fcdallas,2rnm4v,TheWrightMatt,2,Wed Jan 7 19:12:13 2015 UTC,"Tickets purchased after the price increase that followed the Gold Cup announcement do not have to pay a difference. For example, anyone who purchased an Endline seat at $315 already has a ticket in their seat for the USMNT game at no extra cost  edit: only season tickets purchased prior to the Gold Cup announcement have to pay this difference, which will be decided at a later date by CONCACAF"
fcdallas,2rnm4v,TheWrightMatt,1 point,Wed Jan 7 19:14:54 2015 UTC,"So not all season ticket packages? :(   RABBLE RABBLE   Now that its out of my system, it'll probably be 30-50 bucks depending on where the seat is and if STHs that renewed at at the discounted price earlier last year?"
fcdallas,2rnm4v,murm87,2,Wed Jan 7 19:42:52 2015 UTC,"Sorry about that, the price difference isn't actually up to us. The Gold Cup event is strictly a CONCACAF event and they are the ones selling the tickets, but they allowed us to include it in our new 2015 season packages as a treat for our STHs. If you do not want to pay the difference, we will provide you another 18th game at no extra cost. At this time, it is still the only way to secure a ticket for that event.  We have no clue about the price difference yet, but when we get the word from CONCACAF we will pass that message on to our STHs ASAP. If you want to discuss anything more, PM me and I'll give you my info so that we can discuss your situation.  Also, don't forget that all STHs will have access to the pre-sale for the USMNT match. Last time the USMNT was in the area they sold over 80k tickets at Cowboys Stadium, and Toyota Stadium only holds about 22k. Tickets will be very hard to come by, and I would personally not be shocked if they sold out in pre-sale before going on sale to the public."
fcdallas,2rnm4v,murm87,1 point,Wed Jan 7 19:53:26 2015 UTC,Is there a max ticket limit that STH have for the CONCACAF game?
fcdallas,2rnm4v,ur6ci124q,1 point,Wed Jan 7 20:48:19 2015 UTC,"Each Season Ticket seat guarantees you one seat for the CONCACAF Gold Cup double-header event (so 5 season seats = 5 tickets to the Gold Cup event). As for the presale, the maximum number of purchasable seats per person has not been announced yet. Again, that information is decided by CONCACAF (not FC Dallas) and will be announced at a later date. When we receive that information, we will pass it on to our STHs right away. I hope that answers your question"

fcdallas,2r7ht9,huskydefender55,6,Sat Jan 3 17:08:54 2015 UTC,"I'm actually okay with us not splashing on Gerrard. A bit old, not mobile enough to play our counter system."
fcdallas,2r7ht9,Viremia,2,Sat Jan 3 18:43:09 2015 UTC,"As I agree he is on the slower end, his knowledge of the game for younger kids could add value."
fcdallas,2r7ht9,huskydefender55,1 point,Sat Jan 3 19:37:47 2015 UTC,"You don't need every player to have speed for a counter system to work well. Liverpool are known for their fast-paced game that frequently relies on counter-attacks. Gerrard has been key to that system, not for his pace, but his ability to rapidly find open players and deliver pin-point accurate 20-40 yard passes. Few are better than Gerrard has been at that.  Would he fit in to FCD's system? I would think he would. His experience and passing ability from the midfield could work very well.  Do I think FCD will go for him? Not a chance. They'll never spend that money for a 34-35 year old midfileder. Though I'd be over the moon if they did. As a long time LFC fan, you wouldn't be able to pry my butt off the seat for any and all home games. I only see teams like LA Galaxy, Red Bulls, and other high-spending clubs going after him, with LAG being the front-runners."
fcdallas,2r7ht9,LivinDavideLoca,2,Sat Jan 3 20:04:05 2015 UTC,"He'd definitely put butts in seats, but I think the creator in our side is Diaz, and he does a good job of it at this level. He's certainly not Stevie G, but what we need is a guy or two to shield the back four, and Gerrard doesn't fit that mold."
fcdallas,2r7ht9,RedDevilZim13,2,Sat Jan 3 23:35:48 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't want him. Too old, too slow, easily muscled off the ball and pretty much all he does all game is ping long balls to either wing or straight at the 'keeper. He used to be amazing but has fallen off hard over the last year or so and is nearly always the worst player on the pitch when Liverpool play."

fcdallas,2pi27w,devish,2,Tue Dec 16 22:20:59 2014 UTC,What makes you say that? FCDallasGuy's response seemed pretty straight forward. The Gold Cup ticket is included as a bonus match.   Edit: unless you're talking about ticket prices going up. In which case I think that would have happened anyway.   Double Edit: I was basing my response off incomplete info
fcdallas,2pi27w,FCDallasBurn,4,Tue Dec 16 22:24:32 2014 UTC,"To clarify: I had it mostly right.  The new prices are include the Gold Cup, with no added cost.  If you bought season tickets before today, then you would just need to pay the difference between the amount already paid and the cost of the Gold Cup tickets, which is still less than the new prices.    The reason for this is that technically the Gold Cup match isn't put on by FC Dallas.  Toyota Stadium is playing host, but it's still run by CONCACAF.  Sorry for the confusion; I'll go sit in the corner."
fcdallas,2pi27w,RagingBull2488,2,Tue Dec 16 22:54:52 2014 UTC,Any word on when we will announce resignings and or when we can expect to hear about new signings?

fcdallas,2p5j4q,Jimla,1 point,Sat Dec 13 06:18:20 2014 UTC,I just got WAY too hyped for this. Please make it so.
fcdallas,2p5j4q,im_not_your_bro_bro,2,Sat Dec 13 06:36:17 2014 UTC,"If it does end up being a done deal, I can see the stadium hosting a USMNT match this year to help build hype. I believe 2 of their 2015 home matches have locations yet to be announced"
fcdallas,2p2xzs,RedDevilZim13,2,Fri Dec 12 14:42:47 2014 UTC,I think they just anticipate more season ticket holders because of how well the team did and the rise in MLS popularity last season and they are hoping to cash in.   Edit: see my other comment.
fcdallas,2p2xzs,Jimla,2,Fri Dec 12 15:04:11 2014 UTC,"Just bought my season tickets and I can confirm there is ""big news"" coming Monday.. They said it is something included with the price of season tickets but they can't say what yet. Who knows if it will actually be a big deal, but there is something."
fcdallas,2p2xzs,Jimla,1 point,Fri Dec 12 18:52:19 2014 UTC,"Yeah, right? I don't know what happened. The ticket prices haven't actually changed yet so maybe it just got delayed."

fcdallas,2p2xzs,Jimla,1 point,Tue Dec 16 17:51:45 2014 UTC,"Ok thanks! Yeah, i renewed a few months back and then I heard about this highly publicised price jump so it got me curious what people knew. I'm glad to know that there is some announcement.. but like you said, who knows how big it is, and if history is any indicator, i'd choose to be on the disappointing side.."
fcdallas,2p2xzs,Stinduh,1 point,Tue Dec 16 18:08:49 2014 UTC,"Sounds like any normal ""buy now for cheaper"" marketing tactic. They want you to buy season tickets earlier. So they give the people who buy earliest a discount, and then steadily raise prices nearer to the beginning of the season."
fcdallas,2p2xzs,jaw0012,1 point,Tue Dec 16 20:09:19 2014 UTC,"I've been through the offseason a few times now, and it has never come this early before (its usually mid/late January) when they bump it up so I figured that it may be more than just that."
fcdallas,2ow5dt,RagingBull2488,2,Wed Dec 10 19:29:59 2014 UTC,"I hope GJ can get healthy have a come back, but we couldn't take the risk after he never saw the field all last season and with the money he was making.  I think this draft wen't really well for us."
fcdallas,2ow5dt,devish,1 point,Wed Dec 10 20:08:11 2014 UTC,"Really wish he had gone to OCSC. I love the guy, and I don't want to like a NY team.  Our back line will indeed be interesting. I think we may be set, and I'm excited to see Matt continue to be a rock with Zimmerman getting more minutes. Acosta and Hernandez getting more time at fullback will be great to see as well. Some young but talented players that I'm excited to see more of."
fcdallas,2ow5dt,Blitzkrieg357,1 point,Wed Dec 10 19:35:57 2014 UTC,"From what I have heard, Oscar has been pushing to convert Kellyn into a midfielder. So we may be in the market for some depth at fullback."
fcdallas,2ow5dt,RedDevilZim13,1 point,Fri Dec 12 19:20:29 2014 UTC,"I think that's justified, as I believe Kellyn is a natural DM (and plays as such for the U 21 USMNT). I'd like to see Zach back out on the right, but I think we could definitely use some depth, especially considering I'm not completely sold on Moises as Jair's permanent replacement."
fcdallas,2ow5dt,Blitzkrieg357,1 point,Fri Dec 12 20:20:35 2014 UTC,I completely agree. I'd like to pair Zach and JW (in the current squad) or pick up somebody to pair with Zach. Have Mo and Jevaughn as depth.
fcdallas,2ow5dt,RedDevilZim13,1 point,Fri Dec 12 23:25:00 2014 UTC,"While I think he's a pretty good player, I'm not sad to see him go. I'm honestly glad that we got the space to get a player who CAN play. He's too fragile. I've seen glass figurines that can take more of a beating than he can! If they can get playing time out of him, good for them both, but I'm glad we got the roster space back."
fcdallas,2ow5dt,Episcapagan,0,Wed Dec 10 20:32:21 2014 UTC,"Surely we'll trade one of them? My money's on Raul unfortunately, would free up an international slot and we wouldn't have to worry about Kennedy or Seitz being away on international duty."

fcdallas,2oadmg,ur6ci124q,2,Thu Dec 4 19:41:01 2014 UTC,The earthquakes are doing that to every team though. There a video ad board on the toll way that occasionally has fcd ads. a couple of years ago it had a dynamo ad
fcdallas,2oadmg,FCDallasBurn,2,Thu Dec 4 21:31:49 2014 UTC,"Toronto fan here (going through individual club subreddits to see if I missed any transfers). There's a billboard here too (though ours is in kilometers), it's a weird stunt marketing campaign.  I'm not sure who they're trying to advertise to."
fcdallas,2oadmg,Makelevi,1 point,Fri Dec 5 14:33:20 2014 UTC,"They are just messing with teams and their fans. A couple of years ago, the dynamo had billboards in cities without a MLS cup saying ""Houston has two of these(MLS cup), what does (hometeam) have?"""

On the field, I am most impressed by his composure. He doesn't need to make flashy saves because he is always in the right position.  Even with Kennedy in town, I think he'll get a good amount of playing time. I'm glad we signed him to a long-term contract!"

fcdallas,2o2wkh,bessle,2,Tue Dec 2 21:36:50 2014 UTC,i don't think there are too many surprises - maybe george is the biggest. but i think between loyd's success moving to the middle this year and john's base salary of $300k it still isn't a shocker.
fcdallas,2o2wkh,Daniel-H,2,Tue Dec 2 20:44:05 2014 UTC,He didn't play all year and just had another surgery recently.  My guess is he's done for.  Very sad.

fcdallas,2o3cvj,Daniel-H,1 point,Tue Dec 2 22:46:48 2014 UTC,"Regarding DP's, Clavijo said they're not looking for a big name with a big price.

fcdallas,2o3cvj,ICM23,1 point,Wed Dec 3 00:01:32 2014 UTC,"True, but they've been linked to Mix before, and Essien's agent is Clavijo's son. And I like both of those players."
fcdallas,2o3cvj,ICM23,1 point,Wed Dec 3 00:05:08 2014 UTC,It would be a complete 180 from what they usually do but that's not a bad thing. I say if you're going for a big name player go all out and try and bring someone who will help us on and off the field by bringing more fans in.
fcdallas,2o3cvj,ICM23,2,Wed Dec 3 00:15:23 2014 UTC,"I think that Mix, at least, would do that. He's uber-marketable. Essien would draw in some Chelsea & Ghana fans."
fcdallas,2o3cvj,huskydefender55,2,Wed Dec 3 00:17:47 2014 UTC,"Seeing Acosta and Ulloa together in the midfield would be awesome but I think they're gonna bring someone in with more experience. Pareja brought Thomas over so I'm assuming he'll want someone with a similar playing style. Even if Thomas gets signed, central midfield is going to get some new pieces."
fcdallas,2o0osj,RagingBull2488,3,Tue Dec 2 05:17:21 2014 UTC,"I like Hoops Nation. Short, sweet, to the point. Also seems to line up well with your plans to get/keep fans involved. It sounds like a place for fans to go to discuss all things FC Dallas, not just something being spun out from the PR machine."
fcdallas,2o0osj,huskydefender55,3,Tue Dec 2 15:17:06 2014 UTC,"Hmmm...some people may think ""Hoops Nation"" is basketball, and ""FC Dallas Weekly"" will limit it to only one show a week.  Both are good names, I'm just giving an alternate viewpoint."
fcdallas,2o0osj,Daniel-H,1 point,Tue Dec 2 22:40:53 2014 UTC,I do agree with the basketball point. The only other thing is it might prevent relatively new fans from finding the podcast. I didn't know about the Hoops nickname until I really got into following the team.
fcdallas,2o0osj,huskydefender55,1 point,Wed Dec 3 02:37:41 2014 UTC,Yeah very true. I am still in the process of trying to put all of this together. Still waiting to hear back from FC Dallas and Big D Soccer on the show and see if we can't work something out.

fcdallas,2nr9ms,SisuSoccer,1 point,Sat Nov 29 14:02:41 2014 UTC,"So far our Scots Abroad features have taken us across Europe from Spain and Portugal to Holland, Belgium and even Poland but today it is time to venture a little further – let’s head to America.  Ever since Brazilian legend Pele signed for New York Cosmos in the 1970s we have been told that ‘soccer’ is on the up in the States – never has that sentiment been more true than right now.  The USA national team reached the last 16 of the World Cup during the summer, gaining a number of plaudits on their way there, meanwhile MLS is one of the most star studded leagues in the world.  We are all well aware of the time David Beckham spent in MLS, while Thierry Henry has netted 51 goals in 122 games since joining New York Red Bulls and Kaka will make his MLS bow next season when Orlando join the league set up, however, despite the number of international and European domestic honours won by the trio, they still struggle to match the consistent MLS performances of a 28-year-old Scotsman who has been plying his trade in America for the last seven seasons.  After struggling to make the breakthrough at Ross County, Adam Moffat spent a season at Elgin City and then made a move which would make or break his football career – he joined Cleveland City Stars in the USL Second Division.  Moffat during his Elgin days.  Moffat during his Elgin days. The move was a huge gamble for a young footballer but it is safe to say the move was the best decision Moffat could possibly have made.  After just one season in Cleveland, the youngster from Renfrewshire was named in the league team of the season, and secured a move to MLS outfit Columbas Crew.  Since then he has gone on to star for four more of the biggest clubs in America – namely Portland Timbers, Houston Dynamo, Seattle Sounders and now FC Dallas.  This season was Moffat’s first campaign with Dallas, it ended in disappointment as injury ruled him out of the end of season play offs but one disappointment is certainly not enough to sour his seven seasons in America.  Moffat and his FC Dallas team mates against Philadelphia Union Moffat and his FC Dallas team mates against Philadelphia Union Speaking to the P&J, Moffat said: “I picked up a couple injuries this year at bad times so it was tough to get some rhythm.  “My last injury came right before the play-offs which basically ruled me out of the games, that was tough as I would have been playing and over here the play-offs are what you look forward to, so to miss them was very disappointing.  “But I have enjoyed each of my teams over here for different reasons. I had a successful period at Houston Dynamo which I remember fondly.  “Living in Portland and Seattle were both enjoyable as they are both beautiful parts of the country, the climate is a little similar to back home which felt nice, but I never lasted long at either so maybe I’m not cut out for that weather anymore!  “There’s definitely a different style of play over here in America. The league is very diverse so in teams you have players from all different continents trying to play together. It’s great to see the different styles come together.  “It has definitely opened my eyes to other cultures and approaches to the game.”  Over 40,000 fans turned out to watch Dallas take on Seattle in the play-offs and, although Moffat was ruled out by injury, the size of crowds show just how far he has come since leaving League Two Elgin.  But despite making his name in the States, Moffat would not rule out a move back home to the SPFL, he continued: “I have never written off a move back home to play if the right opportunity arose, my future at Dallas is a little uncertain right now going into the break so I will just wait and see what happens here.  “I’m only 28 so I feel I have plenty good years ahead, so I’m just keeping myself healthy and in shape and looking forward to whatever is next.”  Even if he doesn’t return to a club in Scotland, does a man playing alongside and up against a host of international players still harbour ambitions of his own to play for his country?  “I played for school boys up to under-19s with the national team so its been a long time,” added Moffat.  “Of course I would always love to get that opportunity but I will just focus on improving my game at club level and see what happens from there.”  The ‘I will focus on improving and see what happens’ motto has certainly worked well so far for Moffat.  The boy from the Central Belt travelled all the way to the Highlands for his football breakthrough, he has since toured America showcasing his talent and his football journey doesn’t look like coming to an end any time soon."

fcdallas,2najq9,satellitebob,1 point,Mon Nov 24 22:13:59 2014 UTC,But are we limited to only one affiliate?
fcdallas,2najq9,devish,1 point,Tue Nov 25 05:55:23 2014 UTC,I'm not sure. It would make up for not having our own team by having two affiliates.
fcdallas,2nb9hw,Daniel-H,2,Mon Nov 24 23:11:33 2014 UTC,"To protect:  Kennedy - Well, we'll need at least one goalkeeper. I think he's the best, so I'm going with him.  Escobar - Fast, talented, and good buddies with Castillo. He needs to be protected, right? (This is dependent on his loan status, but still.)  Thomas - Good defensive midfielder. Yeah, he got injured, but I don't think that means he's injury-prone. He looks 60, but he's really not even 30. Fun fact: Prince Harry was born before him.  Keel - I think that we need one of John and Keel. He's much cheaper and much less injury-prone.  Moffat, Seitz, Michel, or Texeira - Not sure if we should protect two goalkeepers, two D-mids, or Tex.  Really, I think that it comes down to this:   Kennedy vs. Seitz vs. Fernandez Thomas vs. Michel vs. Moffat Escobar vs. Texeira Keel vs. John   So, I think it's one in each of those categories, plus an extra one. Does everyone else agree?"
fcdallas,2nb9hw,devish,2,Mon Nov 24 23:31:22 2014 UTC,"My list came out just like yours.  I didn't set my goal at 5 players.. I just picked who I thought we could expose.    For sure keeps on that list for me are Kennedy, Esocbar and Thomas.  The rest are almost a toss up.  On your vs scenarios.. I would take Kennedy first then Seitz, mainly to clear up an international slot.  Thomas over Michel and Moffat.  Escobar over Texeira and Keel over John since it looks like John is done for."

fcdallas,2mzs44,satellitebob,2,Fri Nov 21 23:02:07 2014 UTC,Peter Welpton and Steve Hunt who write at 3rd Degree have radio/broadcast history. May be able to help you out.
fcdallas,2mzs44,satellitebob,3,Fri Nov 21 16:57:01 2014 UTC,Just emailed both of them. I hope to maybe hear back from them soon.
fcdallas,2mzs44,huskydefender55,2,Fri Nov 21 17:36:05 2014 UTC,"The other guy who started 3rd Degree, Buzz, is also in broadcasting. They're a wealth of knowledge and were very active when I first got into the team. Their practice reports were so detailed they were asked to stop because other teams were using them for scouting."
fcdallas,2mzs44,huskydefender55,2,Fri Nov 21 19:15:46 2014 UTC,"This. I would love this, FCD have a great web and social media presence, but it is difficult to learn about the club itself, whether keeping fans up to date, or more about the history for newer fans."
fcdallas,2mzs44,huskydefender55,2,Fri Nov 21 19:01:14 2014 UTC,"Yeah. I completely agree. I Would love to get into this. I am currently still working on bettering my overall knowledge of the league and learning as much as I can. I have only been following them for about 2 years now, but fell in love with them the second I went to a match."
fcdallas,2mzs44,curtneedsaride,2,Fri Nov 21 20:20:55 2014 UTC,"Let me know if you decide to pursue this, or if someone else you know does. I've been going to games for years but only seriously started following a few years ago. I'd be interested in getting involved if there's an opportunity."
fcdallas,2mzs44,Daniel-H,3,Fri Nov 21 22:01:18 2014 UTC,Well as of now I am getting tons of interest lol. I am all for bringing in people to help out and contribute to any potential show. All of this has been rather overwhelming so far lol. I truly was not expecting much out of this. As of now I do plan on trying to pursue this 100%. I have put out some emails to some beat writers and editors to see what they have to say and if they can offer any advice at all with any of this. There literally is no FC Dallas podcast or anything like this. There is barely even any video coverage at all. Which amazes me. If I am going to do this I want it to be top notch and not half ass any of it. I want to put out a quality product. The goal I have in mind for it is to reach fans and provide them with some new content besides their typical blogs and stuff like that. Give them a new way to follow the team and even provide people with an opportunity to get involved and present their own opinions and chime in on topics that we might have.
fcdallas,2mzz34,satellitebob,2,Fri Nov 21 17:08:43 2014 UTC,The Austin Aztex are having a launch event tomorrow evening.  The Aztex will be unveiling their MLS affiliate at that time.  I am hopeful (as an Austinite that travels for FCD games).
fcdallas,2my5db,Daniel-H,2,Fri Nov 21 03:24:33 2014 UTC,"I think the biggest questions we will face here are: What is Escobar's status when his loan expires. Do we buy him (I thought he was exciting to watch, but could be better) or let him go back to Kiev?  The second big question in my mind is: Which two keepers do we protect?  With that in consideration here is my list.    Castillo-Hedges-Akindele-Loyd-Texeira-Escobar-Fernandez-Perez-Diaz-Seitz-Kennedy    Thomas and John are both good players but the injury concerns make it unlikely that Orlando or Nycfc want to chance it on them.   Fernandez is a solid keeper and i don't doubt he will get selected, but i personally think Kennedy and Seitz are better, this is the hardest decision for me to make though.   Watson is fine at right back but i really hate his play on the pitch sometimes, and i hope Zimmerman can fill in at CB next year (he was good against Vancouver) leaving Loyd at RB.  Anyone else i'm happy to let go, but i doubt anyone wants them cough (Luccin, Keel, Moffat) cough. I anticipate Benitez will retire and he is the only one worth a mention.  I wanna see some others thoughts, as i think the GK and Watson decisions will be controversial.  Edit: swapped Michel out for Fernandez, I've been convinced he isn't as useful as the sale of the third keeper."
fcdallas,2my5db,joeorangeshoes,2,Fri Nov 21 04:07:20 2014 UTC,"Hedges Castillo Akindele Loyd Diaz John Seitz Kennedy Perez Texeira Moffat    12th - Fernandez 13th - Keel?  No Michel because he's probably the worst footballer I've ever seen when the ball is in play. Fernandez I'm willing to let go over the other two but I'd possibly swap out Moffat for him just to have the extra goalkeeper to sell. The others (Watson, Thomas, Keel, Luccin etc) wouldn't really be missed."
fcdallas,2my5db,LivinDavideLoca,2,Fri Nov 21 20:13:48 2014 UTC,Akindele Castillo Diaz Escobar? Hedges John Kennedy Loyd Perez Seitz Thomas Moffat Watson

fcdallas,2my5db,joeorangeshoes,1 point,Fri Nov 21 04:39:55 2014 UTC,"We are weak at CB but we still have Zimmerman and Loyd who can play there, and i doubt John would get drafted (plus with as expensive as he is it might be a blessing to have him drafted).  I really don't see anything in Keel. When he plays we look bad at the back. At this point i'd hope that the (hopeful) loss of Keel would prompt Pareja to pick up a good CB."

I'm sure we drafted him as trade bait, so we wouldn't want to give a starting keeper away without getting more than just allocation money (I'm sure NYCFC would have taken him at 2 in the Chivas draft if he was available)"
fcdallas,2my5db,joeorangeshoes,2,Fri Nov 21 04:04:22 2014 UTC,"Can you explain your decision to protect John and Keel? Keel has always seemed pretty terrible.   Also, why no Perez Michel or Watson?"
fcdallas,2my5db,joeorangeshoes,2,Fri Nov 21 04:11:54 2014 UTC,"Yeah, Perez is a must-pick for me, but Michel and Watson are dispensable. Michel is a one-trick pony, and while he's incredibly good at that trick (set pieces), Diaz is also good at that."
fcdallas,2my5db,Blitzkrieg357,3,Fri Nov 21 04:24:05 2014 UTC,"I agree to some extent Michel's passing is torrid as is his defending and i'd revise my list actually, put Fernandez in for Michel, sell the keeper Pareja decides is the worst."

fcdallas,2mb6i8,TheWrightMatt,2,Fri Nov 14 19:16:27 2014 UTC,I'd lean toward Delgado.  Dan Kennedy would be nice but if we keep Seitz and Fernandez I think we're set in the net.  Stick with the young team mantra and pick up Delgado. The current youthful team is clicking and looks promising if we keep them all over the next 2 to 5 years.
fcdallas,2mb6i8,b0xors,1 point,Fri Nov 14 21:20:20 2014 UTC,We could go about this two ways. We could pick up Delgado who is a fine young player with good potential. Or we could pick up Kennedy and use him to barter for a trade. ATM I'm siding with Delgado but I didn't see us picking up Akindele and look how he turned out

fcdallas,2m0mz0,ICM23,2,Tue Nov 11 23:34:48 2014 UTC,While this doesn't really go too  into depth of the overall game it does point out small things that could be worked on going forward. Pareja has always favored possession-passing soccer over the lob and counter and I think with a full offseason of being able to go after the type of player he wants we'll see less of these 'missed' chances to really dismantle defenses.

fcdallas,2lxwwu,motioneso,9,Tue Nov 11 06:11:30 2014 UTC,EVERYTHING IS BULLSHIT. I'LL BE IN THE ANGRY DOME.
fcdallas,2lxwwu,JohnMLTX,5,Tue Nov 11 06:14:48 2014 UTC,"If we had a missed penalty than Dempsey's shout was even clearer. The ref was bad, but he was at least consistently bad.  I can't be too mad, we are out, but we had a hell of a season and most of the team is under 25. WE'LL BE BACK."
fcdallas,2lxwwu,joeorangeshoes,5,Tue Nov 11 06:17:28 2014 UTC,I would have rather both of them called though! Then we'd be in extra time right now instead of out due to away goals.
fcdallas,2lxwwu,Daniel-H,2,Tue Nov 11 06:19:55 2014 UTC,"Would be in extra time if both PKs were made. Michel is a PK boss and Seitz had a crazy good game, so maybe we would've still won with that.  Either way, it was a disappointing way to go out, but a great season nonetheless. Pareja's first year, semi-rebuilding mode, no George John, and not too much of Diaz and Thomas. A few key signings and we're looking at a title-contender, easily."
fcdallas,2lxwwu,huskydefender55,3,Tue Nov 11 06:26:10 2014 UTC,"As long as we don't get taken apart in the Expansion Draft. I feel like we're a huge target because we've got young, talented guys behind some great players, and no matter who we protect, we've got important guys exposed. Who do we keep? Tesho or Perez? Zimmerman? Which keeper? Ulloa or Moffat? Where do Michel and Hernandez come in? Then we have guys like Coy Craft and Danny Garcia waiting behind the lines. Big questions for Pareja and Hunt to answer. I'm glad I don't have to."
fcdallas,2lxwwu,Daniel-H,2,Tue Nov 11 18:13:02 2014 UTC,"True, but the great thing is that homegrown players are automatically protected, so we won't have to worry about Ulloa, Hernandez, Acosta, Garcia, Craft, or Gonzalez."
fcdallas,2lxwwu,huskydefender55,3,Tue Nov 11 21:34:17 2014 UTC,That is awesome! I did not know that. We should be pretty set then!
fcdallas,2lxwwu,Medoingreddit,2,Tue Nov 11 21:56:13 2014 UTC,"That makes it hurt more! Man I hate Seattle.   Next year is going to be exciting, can't wait for it start!"

fcdallas,2lxwwu,pawlije,2,Tue Nov 11 07:10:48 2014 UTC,Probably the best way to end a non-championship season. Played well in both legs and have a promising 2015.
fcdallas,2lyr2o,Comet7777,3,Tue Nov 11 13:53:56 2014 UTC,"Seitz is our #1 goalie although some people may beg to differ because Raul is just as good.  In regards to last night's game, the commentators said something along the lines of Raul having some injury or such.  Either way I'm glad that they are both on FC Dallas and Seitz had one hell of a game last night."
fcdallas,2lyr2o,murm87,1 point,Tue Nov 11 15:17:41 2014 UTC,"“It is good in a certain way for the team because you have two keepers who are battling every day, battling for the position. It’s great. Chris came in and he was huge in the game. Then, Raul came and did the same. One thing I’m sure is that either will do an excellent job for this team,” Pareja said. “We’re at that level right now and they know that I’m not afraid to put one or another. I have plenty of confidence in both. At this point, it comes down also to who’s healthier and who’s physically healthier. That is a fact.”  More here: http://soccerblog.dallasnews.com/2014/11/fc-dallas-quick-hits-nov-9-2014.html/"

fcdallas,2l4stw,jhparty,5,Mon Nov 3 13:36:58 2014 UTC,Don't forget we will have Diaz next week. I am hoping for a 4-2-3-1 with Diaz in the middle and Tesho and Castillo on the wings

fcdallas,2l4stw,BigOHeadphones,1 point,Mon Nov 3 07:13:08 2014 UTC,"Second game out, took the kiddo and the entire family had an absolute blast.  The FCD fans are amazing, love the friendly pre-match party atmosphere. Kiddo had to hit the porta potties and spotting him doing the ""I need to go"" dance, the guy in front gets the entire line to let him skip ahead. Wasn't expected but shows what a generous bunch you are.  Will absolutely be attending regularly next season.  Match was great, disappointed with the result. First half was impressive, second half we seemed to have dropped a couple gears, couldn't get the passing cohesion we had in the first. Finally woke up towards the end, but that was clearly our game to lose.  Zach was in full beast mode again, seemingly at the end of every dangerous ball near our box. The Man U fan in me is massively jealous.   Also thought Castillo put in a great performance."
fcdallas,2l4stw,WalkingHumble,2,Mon Nov 3 15:33:51 2014 UTC,"Castillo and Escobar are my favorite pair of Colombians, so elegant and skilled on the ball. Glad to see you were welcomed with a warm heart, btw! We love competition, but we love sportsmanship most! (As Castillo demonstrated)"

fcdallas,2kqwkj,Jimla,9,Thu Oct 30 03:13:00 2014 UTC,DALLAS TIL I DIE!! Great match! I'll take the win.

fcdallas,2kqwkj,totspur1982,2,Thu Oct 30 05:08:58 2014 UTC,It seems like /r/MLS is turning into /r/soccer (which a couple years ago became like Bigsoccer).  I guess just the sheer number of subscribers will eventually turn a subreddit/website into a hostile environment.
fcdallas,2kqwkj,perkited,3,Thu Oct 30 07:07:00 2014 UTC,In my eyes clearly a penalty. Waston tried to play the ball with his chest but missed and controlled it with his arm.

fcdallas,2kqwkj,phantomknight,3,Thu Oct 30 04:14:39 2014 UTC,"I'm going to guess that it came from the 115-116 section of the stadium. The light was big so it had to have been from across the field.   While I hate the fact that someone used a laser pointer in the middle of the PK, I don't think it really effected the outcome. But it looks bad because it's on video and the rest of the league already hates Dallas. I imagine metal detectors may be used at the stadium, now."

fcdallas,2jn0a2,soundthealarm21,5,Sat Oct 18 21:19:55 2014 UTC,RSL play Chivas in their final game which is basically marked as a win. So we will need a win against portland on the 25th who needs a win to secure a wild card spot. If by chance we don't pull the win out the wild card game will be against none other than portland. Going to be a great atmosphere!! DTID!!
fcdallas,2jn0a2,dobetterthanthat,4,Sat Oct 18 23:28:03 2014 UTC,Don't write off Chivas. They beat RSL already this month. They have nothing to lose so they'll play with no stress. I'm predicting a draw.
fcdallas,2jn0a2,jord4nrob,2,Sat Oct 18 23:43:34 2014 UTC,And a draw won't be enough to lift RSL into the 3rd spot (tie-breaker goes to most wins)

fcdallas,2j8yk4,gunnerssoccer,7,Tue Oct 14 21:34:40 2014 UTC,I'll second that. It would be great if there was light rail to the stadium. Or if they could have a couple of games at the Cotton Bowl or another venue closer to civilization that would be nice.

I want to get season tickets in the beer garden and can only afford 2 right now. would there be any reason to hold off until i can get all 3 i want? It would just be easier for me to pay for 2 now and the last one in a couple weeks than to save up for all 3 at once. I just don't know about discounts or any other reasons.

fcdallas,2j32b8,anothrnbdy,8,Mon Oct 13 03:30:00 2014 UTC,"Also front row at beer garden, I never ever heard the Ebola chant and I was in the center. As a group I'm pretty sure we know better but you can't avoid the one asshole who thinks things like that are joke. There were times when things were being yelled at Donovan that I didn't join in on because I'm not about that life when it comes to the USA players. But when at one point he went to get water when the ball was dead and people were yelling and cheering for him. Before and after the match there were very loud and long USA chants and when he walked through the garden during halftime to get to the locker room everyone was cheering for him. As for the chants, every team in the world does their best to discourage the other team but also support their own. I would definitely say we do more uplifting songs than negative ones.   If it makes you feel better when I talked to some of the players they said they can't hear them for the most part unless they're RIGHT next the garden??"
fcdallas,2j32b8,looominarty,7,Mon Oct 13 13:33:59 2014 UTC,"Honestly, I find the majority of the chants from the beer garden lacking imagination and are focused on negative things about the opposing team. I'd rather hear songs and chants supporting our guys and helping lift them up to the win, the other crap is immature and annoying. I completely agree with you."
fcdallas,2j32b8,motioneso,7,Mon Oct 13 04:53:57 2014 UTC,"If you watch other MLS games, their fans have the exact same chants only changing the team name to be for their team.  So it's not just FC Dallas, it's all MLS."
fcdallas,2j32b8,murm87,1 point,Mon Oct 13 15:10:15 2014 UTC,"No I agree,  it's definitely MLS as a whole.  It's like these fans think it's a real tough battle going on so the supporters have to be really aggressive.  Maybe I just don't get it..."
fcdallas,2j32b8,motioneso,2,Mon Oct 13 15:12:42 2014 UTC,"But it is!  But seriously, the ebola thing was probably too much but overall I think the chants are harmless.  In sports all fans are going to be against the other team and other fans, that's just how it goes.  At least we don't riot like European fans ;)"
fcdallas,2j32b8,murm87,3,Mon Oct 13 15:19:28 2014 UTC,I definitely think the chants are harmless for sure.  I just wish they were better... :)  I have a few songs for players I'd love to pass around. Maybe I'll go ahead and record something for it.
fcdallas,2j32b8,motioneso,1 point,Mon Oct 13 15:27:27 2014 UTC,To be fair every league in the world is the exact same about chants. I good number of MLS songs are modeled after Premier League ones. European teams are even constantly being punished for their fans doing racist chants or tifos. We're far from that. But songs are a part of the sport.

fcdallas,2j32b8,Matthew21110,1 point,Mon Oct 13 18:14:37 2014 UTC,I would be interested in seeing what you could do in the way of organizing 500+ people to sing an original song together. The drums are horrible and a major part of the problem. But if the songs being sang are what is bumming you out then you are going to games for the wrong reason. The garden isn't for everyone though.
fcdallas,2j32b8,Matthew21110,1 point,Mon Oct 13 18:34:48 2014 UTC,Creative songs that are wordy usually tend to die out because the random a who show up to 1 game. It's hard to get people to pick up on the words to chants

fcdallas,2hyond,Rilgon,3,Thu Oct 2 02:41:23 2014 UTC,"Our priority is our first game, which may turn out to be a home play-in game on Wed 10/29.    Since our bracket and schedule aren't set in stone yet, we have limited options for a potential game on the following Sat/Sun.    We're offering a refund upon request (emphasis on upon request) for the 2nd game to those who purchase the 2-pack and the 2nd game is not played.  If you want to only go to the weekend game, your best bet is to call in to the front office (PM me for my phone #) to get a voucher, which can be applied to any of our playoff games.  However, we will not offer a refund or credit for any vouchers.    If you can only make the game on that weekend, I would advise just waiting for a bit until our standings are more concrete.  Once we know who/when we will be playing, our ticketing options will make more sense."
fcdallas,2hyond,FCDallasguy,2,Thu Oct 2 14:49:57 2014 UTC,"Awesome, thanks so much. :) And yeah, I'd love to make it to all the games I can, but working a 9:30-7 schedule in Downtown leaves options for getting all the way out to the stadium in time for a game a bit uh... narrow, at best. :P"
fcdallas,2heklv,m3ntberrycrunch,1 point,Thu Sep 25 05:15:24 2014 UTC,"Conflicted really, Both of Texeira's goals were very oppurtunistic, not to say they weren't good, but he didn't create chances. I want to like him and hope he keeps playing like this, but i still don't think he is worth a dp slot.  Escobar on the other hand is really starting to look good. He needs to learn to pass the ball and be a little less selfish but he is looking pretty dangerous."
fcdallas,2heklv,joeorangeshoes,1 point,Thu Sep 25 06:52:37 2014 UTC,"I'd agree with the first goal concerning tex, and you're right about Escobar several times we had a break where he chose to hang on to it only to turn the ball over."
fcdallas,2heklv,huskydefender55,1 point,Thu Sep 25 07:35:20 2014 UTC,"That's my main problem with Escobar. However, Castillo had the same problem a few years ago and it seems to be fixed. As long as we don't lose Castillo, I'd be okay with losing Escobar. On the other hand, Rex seems like an unusual striker for FCD. We traditionally have pacy wingers and a target guy up top. Tex strikes me as more of a poacher who likes to run into the ball and stretch defenses, rather then muscle them around like Perez and Tesho. We're not really set up for a striker like that. I think given some time, we could see some really good stuff from him if he and Mauro can link up and develop a partnership. Tex can clearly finish, he just needs some decent ball to foot service."
fcdallas,2heklv,flyer488,1 point,Thu Sep 25 14:46:47 2014 UTC,"Escobar is here on loan,  so I'm not sure if his long term status at the club. He is definitely improving as a winger,  as has Castillo, which he attributed to Pareja's coaching."
fcdallas,2heklv,huskydefender55,1 point,Thu Sep 25 23:02:45 2014 UTC,"With these new rumors of Club America in Mexico sniffing around Castillo, I'd be ok if we extended Escobar's deal."
fcdallas,2heklv,huskydefender55,1 point,Fri Sep 26 00:09:53 2014 UTC,"I don't know if we could keep Castillo away from Club America. Maybe if it were one of the lesser teams, but not them. Anyway, the story I read made it seem like he would be a temporary replacement for one of their outgoing players, so maybe he'd just spend a season on loan, then come back. I'd be alright with that for sure."

When Ulloa went down late in the first half, several of them were practically high-fiving over the foul.  I don't know for sure, but that seemed to be what riled up Papi and Bazan pretty good.  At HT, a livid Papi actually confronted Robinson and got in his face about it.  Say what you want about this team, but the ""don't mess with us"" attitude is something we've been missing for a long time."

If it's the former then pretty much anywhere in the horseshoe will work, it really just depends on if you wanna see the match from the sidelines or from behind the goal. If it's the latter then sit in the beer garden. The bleachers themselves are sold out but any ticket will get you down there, and security isn't terribly strict with checking if you have bleacher seats once you're down there. Good luck bro."
fcdallas,2fwyoe,WhoAteMyPizza,1 point,Tue Sep 9 18:03:56 2014 UTC,Adding on to this. Security will normally let you in the bleachers in the beer garden if it's not too crowded even if you don't have a ticket

I think we'll miss both Michel and Blas, but overall I feel fairly confident about this match considering our form. I think the key is to pounce on them early with a lot of pressure, and hope for the best. I think this season has shown that the Fire will stay in any game as long as you let them. I fully expect Castillo and Escobar to absolutely OWN the wings.  3-1, Burn FC Dallas. Akindele (2) and Castillo on the sheet for the good guys."

fcdallas,2ec5si,EffYourCouch,4,Sat Aug 23 03:30:24 2014 UTC,"100% true.  If Mauro Diaz can be fully healthy for the playoffs (I say rest him all the way), then I would say that this team has a great chance at...  I won't speak of it so as not to jinx it."
fcdallas,2ec5si,EffYourCouch,2,Sat Aug 23 03:31:40 2014 UTC,"Agreed, between Castillo, Akindele, Perez(even though he can be a spaz at times) and Diaz we are a team to wreckon with."

fcdallas,2ec5si,Elguapo361,2,Sat Aug 23 03:25:13 2014 UTC,I think that red card will get rescinded.
fcdallas,2ec5si,huskydefender55,2,Sat Aug 23 03:36:34 2014 UTC,I sure hope so.
fcdallas,2ec5si,huskydefender55,1 point,Sat Aug 23 03:41:57 2014 UTC,"No, but I'm more okay with losing Blas. It was a bullshit call, but it was on a well earned reputation.   Frankly, he seems to be a momentum killer. Every time they seem to have a a fast break, it dies as soon as he touches it and tries to dribble. I like the way he tries hard, but he's just too slow to be up top IMO.  Bring him in as a super sub to poach against tired defenders, but I don't want to see him starting anymore."
fcdallas,2ec5si,huskydefender55,1 point,Sat Aug 23 05:17:58 2014 UTC,"I agree. Don't get me wrong, he has done a lot for this team and I have tremendous respect for his work rate. However, he is starting to look a little slow, and in Akindele, we have a ready made replacement. Once Diaz is back to full health, bring him back to distribute to Castillo, Tesho, and Escobar.  On the Michel issue, I just think that his distribution out of the back is a liability, and even his deliveries (tonight excepted) haven't been up to snuff this season. Add to that the fact that he has a tendency to jump in to rash tackles and give away FKs in dangerous locations, and I'd much rather have Moffat, Thomas, or even Acosta in there. Acosta is a DM after all, and I'd like to see him get a run out in his preferred position."
fcdallas,2ec5si,huskydefender55,1 point,Sat Aug 23 05:30:12 2014 UTC,"Perhaps a bit bad, but I see your point. I try to avoid discussing diving because it doesn't really bother me and that's a very unpopular opinion here in the US (or England). I just try not to get too bothered by things in sports, because I'm bothered enough by things in the rest of life."
fcdallas,2ec5si,huskydefender55,2,Sat Aug 23 03:29:45 2014 UTC,"Amen to that. The diving does bother me, but this clearly wasn't. It's even possible that the suspension will get rescinded because it was a terrible call. But I just think that Perez was too focused on getting in RSL's heads and not focused enough on the game. He looked a little slow, and the fewer minutes he sees, the more Akindele does. And I am really liking him right now. I think we've really got a gem of a player, and I want to see him develop with us."
fcdallas,2ec5si,Medoingreddit,1 point,Sat Aug 23 03:36:12 2014 UTC,"Greatest Canadian athlete ever.  He can get frustrating, but Perez often works hard on defense, can pass well (team leader in assists, right?) and is quite an efficient finisher.  Both of them will be critical in the playoffs."
fcdallas,2ec5si,im_not_your_bro_bro,2,Sat Aug 23 03:39:56 2014 UTC,For sure. As long as Blas doesn't take any more PKs...
fcdallas,2ec5si,motioneso,1 point,Sat Aug 23 03:42:18 2014 UTC,"I wonder if he's been working on it? Perhaps studying what went wrong?  Pareja will probably watch them in training, and if the pattern holds he will make the correct decision on who to take PKs when the time comes."
fcdallas,2ec5si,huskydefender55,2,Sat Aug 23 03:45:41 2014 UTC,"It's tricky, because I feel like this is something that experience helps dramatically, and we have such a young team. But there are still what, 10 games left in the regular season? We've got a ways to go yet, but if we keep the level of belief we showed tonight when this streak eventually ends, we will be right up at the top."
fcdallas,2ec5si,b0xors,2,Sat Aug 23 04:07:05 2014 UTC,"Also, I just looked, and we are 2 points off our total last season, and 3 goals away from our tally last year."

The thought of ""wow, this player is really good, contributed a lot to this team, and left on good terms"" is enough for me to be proud of wearing a jersey from a player no longer with the team. But that's just me. Bet you'd be safe with one of the younger guys like tesho and maybe Castillo (though if he keeps playing like this, holy shit it's gonna be hard keeping him)  As for parking, it was a huge match with a western power with a member of the USMNT on their squad. I'd definitely recommend getting there earlier.   I think it'd be cool if we did a meet up or something of some sort! Some biiiig matches coming up.   Edit: this might help.

fcdallas,2eciya,phantomknight,1 point,Sat Aug 23 15:02:15 2014 UTC,"I would recommend not getting a name on the Jersey. But if you are dead set on getting a name, get Rhine or Pareja."
fcdallas,2eciya,ingle,1 point,Sun Aug 24 03:52:14 2014 UTC,"Want to buy a jersey with a player's name and number on the back?  Watch more games. Learn more about the players. Find players that you like, and then determine who is likely to stay or not.  More obvious big stars would be Diaz or Castillo, although I'd say it's a pretty good bet that some home-grown-players, like Acosta or Ulloa, will become stars in the near future.  John is a fan-favorite, but with his injuries I'm not sure if he'll play again for the team. Perez is really good, but given that two-thirds of MLS fans would be happy to see his demise this may not be a good choice.  Are you from the Dallas area? If not, perhaps getting the jersey of a player from your own area of origin would be a good idea. Or maybe your favorite college. A UNC grad could rep both his club and collegiate teams with a Zach Loyd jersey, especially if they hail from Oklahoma."

fcdallas,2duafb,onetruechief,3,Mon Aug 18 00:09:51 2014 UTC,"The typical problem with the 3-5-2 (which is basically what this is), is that instead of giving you more defensive strength, you usually get less. This is because the wing backs end up bombing forward, leaving space in behind. Communication amongst the center backs becomes more difficult, and holding the line becomes almost impossible, especially with guys that have been trained in 4 man defenses for their entire careers. This tactic works well offensively, but we haven't exactly been having problems there.   I'm guessing the main tactical issues you'd like to solve are not having Diaz in the lineup, and shoring up the defense. I think that Pareja's 4-4-2 is very well balanced, and when we have a back line that can play more than one consecutive game together, some of the communication and positioning issues will stop. This is why I think Hedges and Loyd work so well together. They've been playing together a long time, and both are smart players. Hedges brings the height and strength, while Loyd is quick enough to pick up anything that goes in behind. I personally like the tactical flexibility that allows us to swap between the 4-4-2 and 4-2-3-1. Sure it means that Diaz isn't on the field all the time, but it does mean that we aren't so dependent on him to create and gives us lots of options going forward. With the likes of Castillo, Akindele, and Escobar, we've got more than enough going forward to handle most teams. I'd love to see Diaz in there too, but the guys I just mentioned are most effective when they can float around up top. Castillo has been freed from the left touchline this season and as a result he has been a revelation. Akindele likes to drop deep into the midfield, and allow someone else (usually Perez or Castillo) to lead the line, then spring forward to launch counters. Diaz can't lead the line like that and he would just be getting into the same spaces as these guys.  TL;DR If it ain't broke, don't fix it."
fcdallas,2duafb,huskydefender55,1 point,Mon Aug 18 02:21:39 2014 UTC,"Another problem with this lineup is that there's no steel in midfield. If Diaz is dispossessed or bypassed, the opposition could run directly at our CBs. This is a tactical nightmare. We shouldn't sacrifice defense in the center of the field for the edges, which is what would occur if we exchange CDMs for wingbacks.    I'll also echo what /u/Daniel-H said, which is that the 3-man backline was a disaster in Vancouver. Communicating who is tracking what run is more difficult. They would have to practice a long time to make it work."
fcdallas,2duafb,luetchy10,1 point,Mon Aug 18 14:02:19 2014 UTC,"Not as much of an issue, because in practice Diaz ends up in a more advanced playmaker role while Ulloa and Thomas or Moffat play a more holding role. This formation usually ends up pretty solid through the middle, but sparse on the wings."
fcdallas,2duafb,huskydefender55,2,Mon Aug 18 15:06:43 2014 UTC,"Did you see the Vancouver game? Clearly a 3-man backline does not solve our shortcomings. Mattocks was wide-open on their first goal, and he missed one or two easy ones that he shouldn't have gotten.  The 4-man-backline is usually better. This is why it is rarely found outside of Italy and this year's World Cup. You need to be great tactically to make it work."
fcdallas,2duafb,Daniel-H,2,Mon Aug 18 08:43:31 2014 UTC,"Well that's just what I'm getting at. If played right, it's not a 3-man defense, it's a 5 man defense with the illusion of a 5-man midfield.   Mattocks got goal opportunities because, with the exception of Castillo, he was the fastest man on the field. Simply put, Matt Hedges didn't mark him well enough.   On the other hand, if the counter attack was just a little bit slower, we would have 3 central defenders instead of 2. I say this is extremely important, because nobody slows down and widens out on a counter attack. On a counter attack you are always trying to attack the penalty box. Hence, 3 central defenders > 2.   And on another note, the 3-man defense is becoming much more popular as of late, specifically in a response to Barcelona's possession dominance. Borussia Dortmund, Bayern Munich, Barcelona themselves, of course Italian teams, Manchester United, Sevilla, will all be running a ""3-man"" defense.   You are right, it must be done perfectly in order to work, but it's a tactical masterpiece in theory."
fcdallas,2duafb,huskydefender55,2,Mon Aug 18 16:07:00 2014 UTC,"The short reason why this doesn't work for us is because for this tactic to work, you have to have 2 world class wing backs. They have to have an attacking mindset, with the tactical nous to do the defensive work, and the astronomical fitness required to do both effectively. We just don't have that, as great as Loyd, Acosta, Hernandez, and Benitez are."
fcdallas,2duafb,huskydefender55,2,Tue Aug 19 12:57:29 2014 UTC,Oh I get that...its just drawing board fun.
fcdallas,2duafb,Daniel-H,2,Wed Aug 20 08:56:23 2014 UTC,"I do agree with the goal though. I personally really like the 3-5-2, and when it works, it is amazing. But when it doesn't, it can go pretty poorly. :P"
fcdallas,2duafb,iamchip,1 point,Wed Aug 20 15:01:27 2014 UTC,"If the wingbacks go forward too much it becomes a 3-man defense (i.e. one less defender) and if they stay back too much it becomes a 5-man defense, where it's actually taking away from the attack.  It's hard to do."
fcdallas,2ds0q0,Daniel-H,2,Sun Aug 17 04:51:03 2014 UTC,"Wasn't expecting that TBH. I had a bad feeling going in, but Oscar keeps making magic with these line-ups. It was actually the line-up I figured for Tuesday prior to the match. I have no idea what that was about, working  Diaz back in maybe?"
fcdallas,2drt7m,motioneso,3,Sun Aug 17 03:10:59 2014 UTC,"Justified Man of the Match. He was electric tonight, and we're going to need him in that kind of form against LA, RSL and Seattle if we're going to make the playoffs."

I started both he and Diaz in a 4-1-4-1 (I signed Beckerman too, and played him as the lone D-mid--this was a pre-Thomas, Moffat, and Ulloa world). Because my strategy involves lots of layoff passes, Mix was leading the league in goals.  Mix is one of my favorite players, so I would love this to happen. Knowing the HSG, will it happen? I highly doubt it."

fcdallas,2delzi,EffYourCouch,5,Wed Aug 13 03:57:52 2014 UTC,That was a rough loss. I think we looked pretty good though. Hollingshead played his heart out and hedges was great. Blas needs to do better. Should of hit the wide open goal when their keeper was out too.
fcdallas,2delzi,IDontLikeAnyofYall,3,Wed Aug 13 04:23:30 2014 UTC,"Man Blas pissed me off tonight. His only shot on target was right at the GK and then that terrible, soft penalty.  He hasn't produced in league play for weeks, nearly a couple of months now. Completely contrasted by Tesho who has been amazing. Really all season Tesho has done very well, but it appears he's really hitting his stride now.  I'd be happy if we dropped Blas and I think we need to drop Texeira too. Between both of them we'd free up ~900k. We could afford a great DP forward with that kind of money."
fcdallas,2delzi,EffYourCouch,3,Wed Aug 13 04:01:32 2014 UTC,"I agree, he needs to go."
fcdallas,2delzi,rojomi5,2,Wed Aug 13 04:02:25 2014 UTC,"Are you guys fucking kidding me? He had a calm, professional goal against the Whitecaps just a couple weeks ago. The week after a great give and go assist to Fabian that gave us out goal against chivas. And last week he was being rested until we had quite a lead already. Yes, Tex is awful, but don't put Blas' poor spot kicking as a sign of a downfall."
fcdallas,2delzi,Daniel-H,3,Wed Aug 13 12:35:52 2014 UTC,"He barely broke double digits with 11 goals in 2013. That was about 0.49 goals / 90 minutes.  He's sitting on 6 goals right now with 10 games to go. It's apparently 0.37 goals / 90 minutes.  So, it looks like he should get 9 goals total for the season based on minutes left and his average. Maybe he can reach 10 goals.

In combined goals and assists, he leads the whole team with 11.  I think it would be silly to get rid of him."

fcdallas,2delzi,motioneso,2,Wed Aug 13 11:58:57 2014 UTC,"I've been really impressed by Ulloa these past few games. Blas has hit a wall and needs to go, I think Tesho needs to start at our #9 role. Can't wait to drop Texiera and sign a strong DP striker."
fcdallas,2delzi,Daniel-H,2,Wed Aug 13 05:28:27 2014 UTC,"So you know what won't work if you try it 20 times a game? The long through ball! Yes I realize we got one goal off of it, but that was in part to goal keeper error. We NEED to be able to move the ball around a little more and THEN create the run. Trying to launch it from half with Castillo waving his hand in the air for 75% of our chances is really annoying.  Really frustrating way to lose, but glad we got this far. Here's to hoping things get shaken up and we get some new players in next year."

You can also meet fans at The Londoner (pub) on the south west side of the stadium before and after the game.  I wouldn't expect but about half the stadium selling due to the game being on a Tuesday and not a league match.   I don't think parking will be too much of a pain in the ass as it usually is on normal games... so go for the free parking areas.

We've been on a pretty good roll lately and the last match we've lost in league play or US Open Cup was in May. (No I'm not counting Aston Villa)  The US Open Cup doesn't carry the prestige of the MLS Cup, but I'm betting if you talked to most players and coaches they definitely want to win it, especially since we're so close. Gaining 3 points on Colorado at this point in the season would be pretty big, and we're playing at home. You'll probably see most of our starters on the pitch for both matches, although based on Sunday's match, Diaz might not be back 100% yet.   EDIT: Also, we won the coin flip last night. So if we win against Philly on Tuesday then we'll host the final. Boom."
fcdallas,2cp4ox,WhoAteMyPizza,3,Tue Aug 5 16:25:50 2014 UTC,I would think that you would put the best team available out there for both games to get the win.  But since Im rather new to the sport I just wasnt sure how much fatigue would factor in and if one game was more important than the other.

fcdallas,2chvsu,Medoingreddit,2,Sun Aug 3 13:55:14 2014 UTC,Agreed. The remaining Western Conference games especially are critical. I'm really glad Hedges wasn't hurt badly. We desperately need him on top of his game.
fcdallas,2chvsu,huskydefender55,2,Sun Aug 3 14:03:58 2014 UTC,"Exactly. This is the time where the playoff teams are separated from the non-playoff teams.  Look at the table. The top 6 teams all look, to me, like playoff teams. The other 3? We've got Portland (Valeri and Nagbe on one team isn't nice), Chivas (Cubo is deadly), and San Jose (they just won 5-1, and then beat the Conference leaders, oh, and they just signed a new DP to compliment Sir Wondo).  FOUR OF THESE TEAMS WILL NOT MAKE THE PLAYOFFS!!!!!  Now is the time to make sure that FC Dallas isn't one of those 4 teams."

fcdallas,2c46a6,huskydefender55,2,Wed Jul 30 05:15:17 2014 UTC,"I imagine we have to bring somebody new in. Of course it may not be until the end of the season, especially using that allocation slot. That's assuming they want to offload Tex and bring in a new DP. I think they'll be hesitant to get rid of him before the end of the summer. That being said, I'd love to pick up a new CB, and now we have the space and cash to grab one."
fcdallas,2c23hp,idashi,3,Tue Jul 29 17:06:25 2014 UTC,"I may have gotten frustrated with the amount of long shots he took over the years, but he always seemed to put 100% effort in every game and for that I'll miss him! Hope he does well with NYCFC.  Any possible reasons why we would make this trade? Cap space?"
fcdallas,2c23hp,Wildcat427,3,Tue Jul 29 17:13:57 2014 UTC,I'm guessing cap space. We could have given Ronaldinho a look if all of our DP spots weren't filled. If only...
fcdallas,2c23hp,swarlos91,1 point,Tue Jul 29 17:17:39 2014 UTC,I don't know what I would do with myself if we signed Ronaldinho...it's a pipe dream though! Haha   Guess we'll just have to wait and see what the front office does.
fcdallas,2c23hp,Wildcat427,3,Tue Jul 29 17:29:42 2014 UTC,"Ronaldinho needs to retire. His legs are gone and he is not focused on winning anymore. I'd much rather have a Jermaine Jones than Ronaldinho. That being said, I'm extremely sad to see Jacobson go and have no idea why we let him go for so little. A 3rd round draft pick 2 years from now is a terrible deal."
fcdallas,2c23hp,huskydefender55,3,Tue Jul 29 18:38:51 2014 UTC,"Jones would fit the team much better too.  We don't need creativity in midfield, Diaz, Castillo, and Escobar suit the bill just fine."
fcdallas,2c23hp,huskydefender55,3,Tue Jul 29 19:25:53 2014 UTC,"Agreed. I really want John back. If nothing else, we need some more experience in back."
fcdallas,2c23hp,Daniel-H,3,Tue Jul 29 19:33:40 2014 UTC,"This is a little strange, but considering that he was already probably going to go in the expansion draft, it makes sense to get a 3rd round pick out of him, and also to free up cap space to maybe add another player."
fcdallas,2c23hp,huskydefender55,3,Tue Jul 29 20:06:58 2014 UTC,"Given that it's a 2016, draft pick I'd have been much happier with a first or second round pick. He's a quality veteran and I'm sad to see him go."
fcdallas,2c23hp,Daniel-H,1 point,Wed Jul 30 00:13:23 2014 UTC,"Indeed. They seem to not rate him highly. Ulloa and Thomas are the starters when healthy, and I guess they decided that it's better to have Moffat and Michel than Jacobson."

fcdallas,2bwa3a,Daniel-H,3,Sun Jul 27 23:27:43 2014 UTC,Defense could play better but other than that we are looking pretty good to make a playoff run. At least it wasn't a loss
fcdallas,2bwa3a,dobetterthanthat,2,Sun Jul 27 23:34:53 2014 UTC,"Exactly. I'm not sure what either team was doing defensively, to be honest. I noticed at least two chances that Mattocks fluffed, and I thought ""hmmm, Jermain Defoe would've buried that."" The defense certainly needs to play better. But it was another point on the route to a playoff place."
fcdallas,2bwa3a,huskydefender55,3,Sun Jul 27 23:57:30 2014 UTC,"I'm really starting to hate injuries. Escobar down last week in a useless friendly, now Hedges down. Diaz looked isolated and ineffective, and the long ball game (Option 1 with this new formation) didn't work. Stephen Keel continues to frustrate me.  However, we do seem to be improving on the discipline side of things. Michel and Moffat did a good job for the most part of shielding the defense and Tesho and Perez continued to show that the big two up top can work. I think that having Escobar and Castillo back will help the offense tremedously, but the 4-4-2 has been working well for us. It'll be interesting to see how well Pareja can manage that.   Also, we continue to see tons of youth products in the side, and Ulloa definitely seems like the best of the lot. He could definitely be a long term player for the side (despite my prior disparaging, I'll admit, I'm wrong).   TL;DR: We're getting better! I can't wait for the injuries to be over!"
fcdallas,2bwa3a,huskydefender55,3,Sun Jul 27 23:56:12 2014 UTC,"I'd love to see Ulloa and Acosta both healthy on the team.  Am I the only one who thinks that Hernandez is too undisciplined? This is the second time that he's made a costly error which led to a 2-2 draw against a Cascadia team, after the red against Portland. The foul wasn't in the box, but it's still one that you can't make. How bad would it be to have Loyd at LB and Acosta at RB? Because they seem like the best two full-backs on the team (when is Acosta healthy, by the way?).  And in the first goal, WHY WAS MATTOCKS OPEN!?!?!?!?!?  I mean, uh, why was Mattocks open? They were inviting that pass from Koffie. Shouldn't the central defense be better with 3 instead of 2? Or is that faulty logic?  But yes, the team is improving. And with the absences, against a not-all-that-bad Vancouver team, far away from home, a draw isn't that painful. And Pareja seemed quite happy about it, based on the team selection and the Luccin-for-Perez sub."
fcdallas,2bwa3a,huskydefender55,2,Mon Jul 28 00:08:38 2014 UTC,"I agree. Hernandez definitely needs some work, but with a little tutoring from Jair, I feel like he is a great prospect. But he needs to be next to some top class defenders. Him, Keel and Zimmerman in the same back line is not enough experience, and Keel is just not cutting it. He lost Mattocks for the first goal and gave up several chances that could have lost it."
fcdallas,2bwa3a,huskydefender55,2,Mon Jul 28 01:07:23 2014 UTC,George John.
fcdallas,2bwa3a,Comet7777,2,Mon Jul 28 01:13:57 2014 UTC,I want him back so bad.
fcdallas,2bwa3a,b0xors,1 point,Mon Jul 28 01:59:14 2014 UTC,"Me too. Hopefully he progresses and we get him back for the playoffs. Which would also mean we're in the playoffs, which would be good."
fcdallas,2bwik7,jord4nrob,2,Mon Jul 28 01:02:01 2014 UTC,"I've noticed this too. Also, whenever we have a home game on MLS live, it's ALWAYS the opposing announcers calling the game. Get on it FCD!"
fcdallas,2bwik7,huskydefender55,2,Mon Jul 28 02:03:37 2014 UTC,Thank you! I'm afraid to say Time Warner probably has a death grip on their viewing limitations.
fcdallas,2bwik7,Vindi1,3,Mon Jul 28 02:21:41 2014 UTC,Time Warner doesn't do much better. The broadcast of yesterdays game at Vancouver was laughable. The commentators did their best but the production quality was horrible.

fcdallas,2btyya,Daniel-H,2,Sun Jul 27 03:29:02 2014 UTC,"This was made a few days ago, but it's still relevant and I thought it would be a nice discussion piece. I saw it when I read the article about George John posted earlier.  I personally think that a reserve team would be best. Only keep the 20-or-so that will be playing in the first team, and have the rest get playing time. I think that it's vital for an academy system to do well and improve. Developing youth players is an effective way to improve the team, and I think it's fun to watch a player progress, and go from youngster to star while playing for the team.  Any thoughts?"
fcdallas,2btyya,envican,2,Sun Jul 27 03:33:07 2014 UTC,"They should team up with Michael Hitchcock and the team he just created in Fort Worth. I know a lot of Fort Worth people don't like driving to Frisco, because it's too damn far, and this would be a good way to get people in the metroplex to unite around one team."

fcdallas,2brfhx,Draecon,2,Sat Jul 26 06:22:19 2014 UTC,I know! And even more exciting because they're not saying he's out for the rest of the season!
fcdallas,2brfhx,Daniel-H,2,Sat Jul 26 18:55:05 2014 UTC,This makes me happy. Hopefully they can get him healthy and not rush him back too soon!
fcdallas,2brfhx,totspur1982,1 point,Sat Jul 26 23:17:23 2014 UTC,I have a friend who is close to the team doctors. He was told this much less of an injury issue and more of an issue between John and the new coaching staff. Dont know how much truth there is to that but just a thought....
fcdallas,2brfhx,totspur1982,1 point,Mon Jul 28 03:17:54 2014 UTC,"God I hope not. If John leaves, I will be an extremely unhappy camper. I can't imagine that they would go so far with the injury story if he just didn't like the staff. Although I did think he was a lock for the armband... Suffice to say, I hope he just comes back okay."
fcdallas,2brfhx,totspur1982,1 point,Mon Jul 28 03:22:18 2014 UTC,"If this is the case, then they need to get rid of him and use the space to bring in a new experienced defender. Hedges is great and Zimmerman is going to be a good one, but Keel is definitely not cutting it and we desperately need experience and leadership on the back line."

fcdallas,2bnf4j,Daniel-H,10,Fri Jul 25 01:04:08 2014 UTC,Transfer Texiera. He's costing FC Dallas too much money for rarely making the first team
fcdallas,2bnf4j,Draecon,1 point,Fri Jul 25 01:11:03 2014 UTC,"I wonder if the Hunts' buddies at Columbus will take a chance on him. They're apparently in desperate need of a goal-scorer, and we don't play them again this season barring a hypothetical MLS Cup.  I'm not sure a verdict can be dropped on him quite yet. He's still young, and has probably had problems adjusting. Judging players on their first year in the league is rarely a good thing; sometimes they do far better than expected, and then enter what seems to be a sophomore slump when the honeymoon is over, although it's really just regression to the mean. Other times players seem like a flop, but then do better after an adjustment period (Dempsey, Cahill, etc.--those two came in mid-season, but I'm sure it's a similar effect)."
fcdallas,2bnf4j,rojomi5,1 point,Fri Jul 25 01:31:10 2014 UTC,"He apparently didn't do well in his last league either. It'd be one thing if he just wasn't quite getting to balls or getting bullied around, but he's just not where he needs to be ever. I don't think he has that killer instinct for goals like Tesho has a little and Blas has a lot."
fcdallas,2bnf4j,huskydefender55,1 point,Fri Jul 25 12:44:15 2014 UTC,"He was described as ""washed up"" by the official team website when they published the story about his transfer...  Of course, they were playing him in central midfield, but still."

fcdallas,2bnf4j,TylerGuest1,1 point,Fri Jul 25 18:38:54 2014 UTC,I think he was purchased to give us an alternative to Blas playing every game. I don't think anyone expected Tesho to play as well as he has. When Blas was out Texiera was doing pretty well
fcdallas,2bnf4j,bessle,4,Mon Jul 28 03:22:09 2014 UTC,"Wishful thinking: We make a bid for Chicharito in order to get a world-class player that is marketable to people who just ""dabble"" in FC Dallas soccer. I think that is something we lack when compared to the large market teams."
fcdallas,2bnf4j,Medoingreddit,1 point,Fri Jul 25 03:13:13 2014 UTC,"Even if we made a bid (we won't), he wouldn't come here.  Still wants to prove himself on the big time."
fcdallas,2bnf4j,WhoAteMyPizza,3,Fri Jul 25 15:33:29 2014 UTC,"Here's an idea for a multi-part trade:   Loan Texeira to Columbus, and swap allocation orders in return (I believe they're #1 and we're #2). Sign Jermaine Jones.   After it's done, they have a striker, Texeira will get to play, if only for a little bit until they realize he isn't good (or he does good and ends up clinching a playoff spot for the Crew ahead of the Dynamo), we get Jones, and the Crew are still #1 in allocation order when it's all said and done."
fcdallas,2bnf4j,huskydefender55,2,Fri Jul 25 04:08:13 2014 UTC,"Now this, this I like.  We could really use some strengthing in the center of the park as well now that Thomas is out.  Jones would instantly solidify our midfield, hopefully be a good mentor for Ulloa (and Acosta if his future lies at DM rather than fullback), and would add (a limited amount of) marketability to a team that is in desperate need of it."
fcdallas,2bnf4j,WhoAteMyPizza,2,Fri Jul 25 15:36:29 2014 UTC,"asking columbus to take on texeira's salary on a loan AND swap allocation order seems a bit pricey for them to take on, but i like the idea."
fcdallas,2bnf4j,huskydefender55,2,Fri Jul 25 16:21:12 2014 UTC,"It would definitely feel a need now, but it would be an awfully big asking price for a guy nearing his mid 30's"

I think that the HSG could've pulled some Bezbatchenkian tricks to only have 2 or even 1 of our 3 DPs as not a DP (I mean, Julio Cesar wasn't a DP, why does Escobar have to be?)."
fcdallas,2bc7wj,Daniel-H,3,Tue Jul 22 12:53:19 2014 UTC,"Well Escobar is still technically on loan, so there's a chance he won't stay long term. That may free up a spot. But I've just heard Tex has not been good in training, even when fit."

fcdallas,2b6kxr,Daniel-H,8,Sun Jul 20 03:06:11 2014 UTC,"Tesho is wanting to make a name for himself as rookie of the year. I saw in the /r/MLS match thread someone asked if he is good enough to be starting like this and I think he showed tonight that he is.  Playing the full 90, being important in a lot of plays going forward, and finishing like that in stoppage time was huge from him. Keep it up, kid."
fcdallas,2b6kxr,motioneso,5,Sun Jul 20 04:42:08 2014 UTC,I'm very pleased with Escobar now that he has found his health and form. He is now worthy of that DP slot. If only Teixeira was any good...  Very important match coming up against Vancouver next week. We need points against these West contenders.
fcdallas,2b6kxr,Krodins,2,Sun Jul 20 03:16:37 2014 UTC,"Indeed, the one against Vancouver is super-important. Maybe Diaz can get his first start? After that it's Chivas and then Colorado, two very big games as well. Maybe one of the fringe players can step up against Aston Villa and end up becoming an asset as the season goes on. Maybe Tex can get a hat-trick against them.  Does he have injury problems? He's just disappeared it seems, and I'm not sure why. It's highly plausible that he's been injured and I haven't noticed because everyone else is also injured."
fcdallas,2b6kxr,Krodins,3,Sun Jul 20 03:23:15 2014 UTC,I don't think he's hurt. He just hasn't impressed at all this season and his only goal was pretty lucky. Tesho has been much better in his appearances.
fcdallas,2b6kxr,Krodins,1 point,Sun Jul 20 03:25:41 2014 UTC,"True, but I would've guessed he would've gotten at least one sub appearance."
fcdallas,2b6kxr,huskydefender55,2,Sun Jul 20 03:28:00 2014 UTC,He had an early season start or two and a few sub appearances.  Edit: 4 starts and 8 subs
fcdallas,2b6kxr,m3ntberrycrunch,2,Sun Jul 20 03:29:44 2014 UTC,"True. But only 11 minutes played (vs. Columbus, when Perez was suspended) since May 17th.  Edit: I'm not complaining, I just find it interesting how our DP is rarely ever playing anymore. Blas and Tesho have indeed done much better, so it makes sense."
fcdallas,2b6kxr,huskydefender55,2,Sun Jul 20 03:43:12 2014 UTC,Scrap him and get Xavi! :-)
fcdallas,2b6kxr,phantomknight,2,Mon Jul 21 01:42:08 2014 UTC,"Get on it, HSG!"
fcdallas,2b6kxr,Discord_agent,3,Mon Jul 21 01:46:30 2014 UTC,"Glad we got the win, I was fortunate enough to attend the match, the revs didn't look like they were able to make any progress offensively and we appeared to be way more aggressive. I think I was just getting frustrated with how often we skyed the ball over the goal. Regardless, it was a great result."
fcdallas,2b6kxr,huskydefender55,1 point,Sun Jul 20 04:28:17 2014 UTC,Perez could use a little finishing work.
fcdallas,2b6kxr,mojo_sweat,2,Mon Jul 21 01:42:29 2014 UTC,had to follow the match on my phone (I'm on vacation in D.C.) but it seemed like a good game. Tesho and Escobar's goals looked very nice. haha.

fcdallas,2b4jqn,im_not_your_bro_bro,2,Sun Jul 20 03:06:45 2014 UTC,"I just don't want another end of season crash like last year. I'm starting to get excited about this year, and I can't get hurt like that again."
fcdallas,2b4jqn,huskydefender55,2,Sun Jul 20 03:20:58 2014 UTC,"In what I've seen, it doesn't look like he's had much rust! I think he'll score and somehow set up the other two goals."
fcdallas,2b4jqn,ttufizzo,3,Sat Jul 19 23:11:53 2014 UTC,"I have been such a casual fan, that I never feel that I have much to contribute. But, I have been trying harder this year to pay closer attention(not just WC driven).  Anyway, I know this is generic, but this is one where the Hoops really need to get the full 3. NE has a minus 10 road goal differential."
fcdallas,2b4jqn,devish,2,Sat Jul 19 13:55:47 2014 UTC,"Indeed, because it seems so easy to win (the Revs with that 6-game-losing-streak and all) anything less than 3 points would be a failure.  They just can't get complacent. The table is very nice to us. But it's fake (that should be read in a Portuguese accent). Considering that we've played so many more games, other teams have a chance to gain ground. I think that Diaz can allow the team to do well and get results."
fcdallas,2b4jqn,WhoAteMyPizza,4,Sat Jul 19 23:00:25 2014 UTC,Hope I can make it to this game. Just returning from brazil and have had mutliple flights delayed and missed.   Just arrived in Houston so here's hoping I can rebook a new flight and get to dfw at a resonable time.  3-1 dallas win
fcdallas,2b4jqn,Medoingreddit,4,Sat Jul 19 14:38:05 2014 UTC,What formation do we use with Mauro back?
fcdallas,2b4jqn,huskydefender55,3,Sat Jul 19 16:07:05 2014 UTC,"I was thinking about that too. Obviously, a 4-2-3-1 would be the best formation for Mauro, but with the great play of Perez/Akindele pairing I'm not so sure he will go with just one striker. Possibly move Mauro out left in Castillo's spot and allow him to cheat into the middle? I don't know, it will be interesting to see."
fcdallas,2b4jqn,huskydefender55,3,Sat Jul 19 20:59:36 2014 UTC,"The nice thing is that Akindele can be pretty solid on the right as well. Since Castillo is still out, we can do Perez (or Akindele to rest him) up front, Akindele on the right, and Escobar on the left and we've got a pretty scary offense with Diaz in support. We just desperately need to get the defense sorted. I want Acosta and John back..."
fcdallas,2b4jqn,cornjob81,2,Sat Jul 19 21:07:49 2014 UTC,"Honestly, I have no idea at all.  I mean, an attacking-midfield-three is a must, right? Playing Diaz on the wing seems like a terrible idea.  I think tomorrow I'll drop a thread for us to discuss the first-choice starting XI, because I think that's kind-of important, and I really have no idea because there have been so many injuries and suspensions that half the team has been out for most of the season."
fcdallas,2b4jqn,Medoingreddit,2,Sat Jul 19 23:09:08 2014 UTC,"I have to admit, Ulloa was good tonight. If he keeps up like this, I can definitely get behind him being a regular starter. Pareja got it right on tonight I think. Despite the late goal, I'd have liked to see Akindele come off for Mauro rather than Watson. He looked really tired. Of course it's all moot since he didn't get injured, so he has time to recover."
fcdallas,2b4jqn,huskydefender55,4,Sun Jul 20 03:10:25 2014 UTC,"Definitely need 3 points tonight.  I have the Galaxy game on in the background now, hoping they lose and we win so we can leapfrog up the table a bit.  A tie won't kill us, but 3 will gave us some breathing room."
fcdallas,2b4jqn,huskydefender55,3,Sat Jul 19 22:18:30 2014 UTC,My only question is who lines up next to Ulloa? Jacobson or Moffat?
fcdallas,2b4jqn,huskydefender55,2,Sat Jul 19 15:04:50 2014 UTC,"I'm really not sure. I would guess Moffat, because Pareja has seemed to play him more, but that could just be because Jacobson has had injury problems."
fcdallas,2b4jqn,huskydefender55,1 point,Sat Jul 19 22:56:11 2014 UTC,"Why not Jacobson and Moffat? Ulloa has been okay, but I don't know why he's been playing as much as he has. As long as we don't put Michel in midfield, I'm good."
fcdallas,2b4jqn,huskydefender55,2,Sat Jul 19 21:08:36 2014 UTC,"Ulloa's been great, I think. Generally a bit better than Moffat or Jacobson. Add the fact that he's so young (much more upside than the other two) and he's close to a must-start."
fcdallas,2b4jqn,mojo_sweat,1 point,Sat Jul 19 23:15:05 2014 UTC,"He's definitely been good, but I think we've been suffering some because of his tactical lack of experience. I'm all for getting him on the field, but not as a starter just yet."
fcdallas,2b4jqn,AlaskanBrownBear,2,Sun Jul 20 00:15:58 2014 UTC,"He isn't the finished product, but especially with Thomas out I think he's in the starting XI."
fcdallas,2b4jqn,huskydefender55,3,Sun Jul 20 00:17:24 2014 UTC,I'd certainly take him over Michel.
fcdallas,2b4jqn,dances_with_ronaldo,3,Sun Jul 20 00:18:33 2014 UTC,"Michel's an enigma. He's brilliant on set pieces, but he enters ""turnover machine"" mode quite a lot. Earlier in the year he was simultaneously the 2nd-best and worst player on the team. What annoys me is how people who only watch the highlights talk about how great of a player he is, like that he's our best player or something like that."
fcdallas,2b4jqn,huskydefender55,3,Sun Jul 20 00:25:25 2014 UTC,"That drives me crazy. He's a completely one dimensional player who is terrible when the ball is moving. Now that Diaz is back, I don't think Michel should get a look at all."
fcdallas,2b05fd,satellitebob,5,Fri Jul 18 00:21:58 2014 UTC,"NOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!  Well, at least Ulloa is still okay.  And with Mauro Diaz, anything is possible."

The endline has a suporters group that plays music, really entertaining to sit by, and the opposite endline is the Beer Guardians, the loudest and group in the stadium. FCD usually runs a party bus sort of deal for games with a ticket included. Tix are pretty cheap, usually a promo will be going on and 20$ will get you good seats. Once again welcome!"
fcdallas,2ahhjs,Jock_Thespian,2,Sat Jul 12 04:40:41 2014 UTC,"I always enjoyed sitting on the south end line (opposite of the Beer Garden). The Peruvian support group can be kind of loud at times, but hey, it's a soccer match. I actually also like sitting in the 120-121 section which is on the southeast corner. Really not a bad seat in the house.  From Carrollton, you actually have a pretty easy drive in. If you have the toll tag, you can hop on 121, then hit the DNT right up into Frisco, and the stadium is right off the highway. If you are trying to avoid getting the toll tag, you can easily take frontage roads too. Free parking at the stadium too which makes it good for driving.   Tickets are normally under $20 unless you want to sit on the sideline. Sometimes they'll be a little more expensive. My suggestion is to get a representative. Basically someone in the ticket office that will send emails about special deals that they're running. They'll call occasionally too, but they don't take offense if you're not interested or available for a certain match. Not a high pressure sale situation at all. Miguel Hopkins was mine, and he got me some great tickets and deals.   Happy to have a new supporter. DTID!"

They bought the team in 2005, renamed it from Dallas Burn to FC Dallas, and built the stadium in Frisco. The statue on the North Concourse of the stadium is of the late Lamar Hunt, who was instrumental in bringing soccer to America. The team is coached by Oscar Pareja, who is a club legend. The biggest supporters group is the Dallas Beer Guardians, who stand on the stage and stay loud for 90 minutes.  Players to watch: Blas Perez is our preferred striker. He is a big, strong 33-year old Panamanian. His nickname is Super Raton, or Mighty Mouse, because of his floppy ears. Fabian Castillo is our speedy, unpredictable winger.

He was the principal founder of the American Football League (AFL) and Major League Soccer (MLS), as well as MLS predecessor the North American Soccer League (NASL). Hunt co-founded the World Championship Tennis and was also the founder and owner of the National Football League's Kansas City Chiefs, the Kansas City Wizards and at his death owned two MLS teams, Columbus Crew and FC Dallas. The oldest ongoing national soccer tournament in the U.S., the U.S. Open Cup (founded 1914) now bears his name in honor of his pioneering role in that sport stateside. In Kansas City, Hunt also helped establish the Worlds of Fun and Oceans of Fun theme parks. He was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1972; into the National Soccer Hall of Fame in 1982; and into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in 1993. The National Soccer Hall of Fame bestowed upon Hunt their Medal of Honor in 1999, an award given to only three recipients in history thus far. He was married for 42 years to his second wife Norma, and had four children, Sharron, Lamar Jr., Daniel, and Clark Hunt.

His hold up play has been fantastic also, it seems like it's much better than it has been in years past. To be honest the service in the box hasn't been that great this season for any of the strikers. That will change when Mauro Diaz comes back from his injury which should be soon. All in all you can say that Perez is having a typical consistent year like he normally does."

fcdallas,26mhyx,loudmaster,4,Wed May 28 00:05:27 2014 UTC,Why do we not have a decent backup plan for Diaz!? He went down and the attack just stalled out. All the midfielders we brought in and not a creative or attack minded player in the bunch.  We need a second option for points in the season like this. This is where you bring in an older vet who dosnt want to play every game but can step in when needed. Just some sort of backup plan so that we dont go on 5 game winless streaks because we cant create opportunities.
fcdallas,26mhyx,totspur1982,2,Wed May 28 02:34:11 2014 UTC,"I know, we could put a Uruguayan striker out there to produce goals! But where would we find such a player....?"
fcdallas,26mhyx,Draecon,1 point,Wed May 28 07:10:35 2014 UTC,I love everything I've seen from Texeria. And everybody loves Blas Perez. But they are both strikers and need to be supported by a creative attacking midfielder. Our team was tearing it up with Diaz running the show
fcdallas,26mhyx,totspur1982,2,Wed May 28 19:45:49 2014 UTC,"We all saw the Diaz thing coming in the off-season. Something that the front office doesn't seem to understand is that these small shifty players take a beating out there. The MLS allows it, and that's why these big physical teams win every year. Technical play is basically discouraged by the league in that they don't punish teams for fouling every time a guy like Mauro gets on the ball. It's so damn frustrating. Persistent infringement should be a more prevalent offense."

He wasn't even yellow carded for stepping on Texeira.  I even commented on this exact play on the post-game thread, although at the time I was too mad to remember who he stepped on and about what time in the game it happened):   I saw replays of Bernardez stepping on people TWICE with his cleats. That ref must have held the card because they were already a man down, but he was playing way too rough (and is known for playing too rough). If Bernardez was sent off around the 70-80' when he stepped on Castillo's foot (after earlier trampling over one of our players by stepping on their calf and jumping over them to then land on their leg again in front of the fucking ref) we would have had a significantly better chance knocking in a open play cross.

Thinking of wearing my old Dallas Burn Jersey.  My friends will most likely be in Norwich, Sunderland, and FC Dallas jerseys.  Come by and say hi - we are usually at one of the bar height tables in the middle.   If you are 21 or ever, spend some time down in the beer garden.  Don't worry if your tickets aren't for down there - you can stand behind the bleachers without a ticket.  The very beginning and the very end of the game will be the most raucous times so go during those.  The rest of the match (depending on where your tickets are) will be spent looking over at this area off and on and wishing you were down there.  This area is simultaneously the best (because of the atmosphere) and the worst (because of the view) place to watch the match."

fcdallas,25etuz,Soogo-suyi,2,Tue May 13 20:06:17 2014 UTC,"Just out of interest, how was it?"
fcdallas,259djd,JohnMLTX,3,Sun May 11 04:39:34 2014 UTC,"Texeira is shit, nowhere near worth over $300k. He's played nearly 400 minutes and has 1 goal because of a mishandled ball that bounced over the Sounders GK.  Other than that, he's fumbling around the pitch like a 12 year old running into people. He is responsible for fouling Dempsey in the same game he got his silver platter goal that setup the amazing free kick goal by Dempsey because Texeira doesn't know how to stop from running into people.  Apparently nobody on our team knows how to run towards the goal and shoot the damn ball (besides the injured Diaz). We only know how to get the ball out to Benitez or Michel and curl a ball into the box and hope for the best. We looked like fucking United out there in their crazy 82 cross game vs Fullham. Garcia showed us in his debut he could put some nice shots on target, not sure what has made him so gun shy since.  How the hell did Blas miss the goal from 4 yards out. Why did he go near post instead of far post?  Why does Castillo do the same thing every match. Hyndman and now apparently Pareja have no idea how to teach him to cut inside and shoot if he is that uncomfortable with his left foot. Hell, put him on the right wing then so he can use his speed to dribble down the line all day long and cross the ball in with confidence. I'm tired of watching him run to the endline with a 1% chance of something good happening.  Every one of our midfielders and strikers need to spend time shooting the ball just outside the 18 and most definitely within the 18 yard box.  4 losses in a row. I don't know what I'll do if we lose to Chivas at home next Saturday.  Edit  I saw replays of Bernardez stepping on people TWICE with his cleats. That ref must have held the card because they were already a man down, but he was playing way too rough (and is known for playing too rough).  If Bernardez was sent off around the 70-80' when he stepped on Castillo's foot (after earlier trampling over one of our players by stepping on their calf and jumping over them to then land on their leg again in front of the fucking ref) we would have had a significantly better chance knocking in a open play cross."
fcdallas,259djd,b0xors,3,Sun May 11 04:53:06 2014 UTC,"Escobar at least has his moments. Sell Tex, give Diaz a raise, get Tesho and Castillo up top.  Blas is looking older."
fcdallas,259djd,b0xors,1 point,Sun May 11 04:59:10 2014 UTC,"Escobar is a big question mark for me. He is a DP, right? We've seen a whole 38 minutes of him before he was injured. I know it's unfortunate, but I don't think I've seen enough to feel hopeful towards him yet.  Agreed we sell Tex, what an awful buy.  Diaz most definitely deserves a raise, I worry he's caught the attention of other clubs (in this league or others) and will go where the money is because he is young.  Tesho has looked good in other matches, not so tonight. I will say, however, he is quite confident over the ball which is great. That should lead to smart plays from him in the future (at least I hope). I'd like to see how he performs up top in place of Blas.  Lastly, I'd like to see Castillo swapped on the right wing. If we kept the same formation swap Castillo and Tesho. That will put Castillo in a great position to use his right foot and Tesho seems comfortable with both feet."
fcdallas,259djd,Krodins,2,Sun May 11 05:08:19 2014 UTC,"Agreed on all counts again.  Here's salary info  Escobar and Tex, at 647 and 338, combine for right around a million.  Sell them. Bump Diaz up to at least 750. Make Raul a DP, and use the third for a good striker. Maybe even make a bid for Aron Johansson.  Get Garcia up to 100k, get Michel a bit more money."

For the love of fucking everything, can we get some movement up front? Stop watching the ball Blas and Tex!! Nothing happening up there, nothing at all.  edit: I used to think that Castillo could never find anything in the box was because he just blasted to the end line before the attackers got there, but now I'm not so sure. I saw some hold up play tonight and the forwards were still nowhere to be seen."
fcdallas,250kpb,Medoingreddit,2,Thu May 8 05:30:11 2014 UTC,"Agreed, both Blas and Texeira have bad movement up front.  I think I saw at least 2 crosses into an empty box with either of them still sitting just outside the 18 yard box with plenty of time to have moved within the sweet spot of 6-8 yards out.  Blas especially surprised me, while he can be whiney he's been here and done well the last two seasons to be given some leniency.  Texeira on the other hand, hasn't impressed me in the least. The 1 goal he has was pure luck (still good positioning and pressure I guess) but he tends to fumble over the ball and get knocked over quite easily. Very frustrating to watch."

There are a few chants, I believe they are posted somewhere on the FCD website if you browse around a bit.  I've never seen the players signing on gameday, but sometimes you can wait outside the North entrance after the match and the away team will sign a few things on the way to the bus. I don't know if you have tickets or not, but for first timers, the Beer Garden on the North end line is a great choice. Home to the Beer Guardians, probably the most raucous support group, and discounted beer. Most of the chants originate from them as well.   Other advise is that if you plan on going to more games, get yourself a rep. Somebody from the ticket office to let you know about special offers and stuff.

fcdallas,23xamu,dobetterthanthat,2,Fri Apr 25 04:00:32 2014 UTC,"I've only taken the Blue Line. Since it starts in Uptown, I would guess that it's the rowdier of the two lines given the demographic of the area and that it stops at bars instead of BWWs. Parking might be easier on the Red Line though.   Experience was awesome. It's super easy- everything was really well organized by our ticket rep, you can bring your own booze, met a bunch of other fans through sharing drinks, etc. Literally have no complaints. I might bring a case of beer and pass it out next time."
fcdallas,23xamu,MattSaracen,2,Fri Apr 25 04:25:10 2014 UTC,"Awesome that is exactly the response I wanted. I am looking forward to some rowdy fans providing great atmosphere.  Around what time does everyone show up, amd is the byobeer for tailgating at the stadium? Thanks for input"
fcdallas,23xamu,MattSaracen,2,Fri Apr 25 05:13:20 2014 UTC,Well the bus leaves 2 hours or so before game time. A few people were at BBC when we go there. And the beer was for drinking on the bus (which is strangely allowed)
fcdallas,23sy5v,fcdallas,3,Wed Apr 23 21:41:08 2014 UTC,"Wow, these are really nice. I love the designs."
fcdallas,23sy5v,phantomknight,3,Thu Apr 24 04:01:11 2014 UTC,"Yeah, love the new shirts and a variety of scarves now."

fcdallas,23rpld,fcdallas,5,Wed Apr 23 14:30:17 2014 UTC,"This is great to see! I don't know if it's just because I'm biased, but it does seem like our attendance is getting better compared to just a few years ago. Not so sure about the atmosphere since I haven't gotten the chance to go to a game since last year. I'm hoping that's approving as well!"
fcdallas,23rpld,Wildcat427,3,Wed Apr 23 21:48:17 2014 UTC,"From what I've seen from the streams, the stadium looks much more full, and the atmosphere definitely seems improved!"
fcdallas,23rpld,huskydefender55,3,Thu Apr 24 05:17:19 2014 UTC,"I was there this past weekend and it was probably 3/4 full and fairly loud, I know it was loud right after both goals."

fcdallas,233k2s,devish,1 point,Wed Apr 16 07:12:06 2014 UTC,On a somewhat related note of our back line  I thought Nick Walker looked pretty good tonight vs OKC at CB.  He's new to this level of play but I think he might be up to the challenge if we need him.
fcdallas,22swsb,JohnMLTX,4,Fri Apr 11 19:49:34 2014 UTC,Well when you put it like that
fcdallas,22swsb,ReanimatedCyborg,2,Sat Apr 12 00:45:53 2014 UTC,.....what?
fcdallas,22swsb,Samuelpowizzle,2,Sat Apr 12 05:20:20 2014 UTC,First game tonight. Loved the drumline. The stadium would lose a lot of noise without them
fcdallas,22swsb,do_itt,2,Sun Apr 13 04:28:43 2014 UTC,"The only thing I don't like about the drumline is that a lot of fans in the beergarden stop singing if the drums stop playing, which can lead to a few lulls in the match.  Otherwise they are top notch."
fcdallas,22swsb,Yek0p,1 point,Sun Apr 13 18:05:36 2014 UTC,"Its one thing if they were true fans, but I don't like that they are just paid musicians. Very artificial."
fcdallas,22swsb,Yek0p,3,Sat Apr 12 15:56:40 2014 UTC,"They're fans and local drummers first who are then getting paid. Coming from a drumline kid, I like seeing us give local drummers paying gigs."
fcdallas,22swsb,parsac58,-2,Sat Apr 12 17:25:41 2014 UTC,True fans aren't paid to attend games. We were here before them and will be here after them.
fcdallas,22swsb,IDontLikeAnyofYall,2,Sun Apr 13 05:25:27 2014 UTC,"For me, it comes down to the fact that they add to the atmosphere and always seem truly enthusiastic. Their presence benefits the fans. From what I can observe, their enthusiasm for the game probably cannot exist without at least some level of already existing fandom, apart from any compensation. I trust that the front office was smart enough to seek out fans for the job. And even if they weren't fans beforehand, hopefully FCD has a few more fans now."
fcdallas,22swsb,Yek0p,1 point,Tue Apr 15 06:23:23 2014 UTC,and maybe they attended the games before they started getting paid. Maybe they have been following FCD longer than you have. How would you know
fcdallas,22swsb,oBUSo_B1gT3x,0,Mon Apr 14 16:45:24 2014 UTC,"Yeah, I was just guessing. Its possible. The main point is you won't find this happening at any other soccer game. Most other clubs would not want to be part of that. Ask around other club supporters."
fcdallas,22rbq5,PalletTownSoulja,7,Fri Apr 11 05:52:05 2014 UTC,"Hit up the Fc Dallas fan express. Day drink at the first bar it picks you up, takes you to another bar, tall boy on the bus, drink heavily first half, be responsible and one of you cut yourself off at the half. Bus makes 2 stops on the way back, drink water to rehydrate at those bars.  should give you about 3 hours to sober up. Bonus points if you can über your way to and from the bar! Enjoy!"
fcdallas,22rbq5,NoPasaNadaSenor,5,Fri Apr 11 12:59:28 2014 UTC,"Sound advice from /u/NoPasaNadaSenor  I live in Cedar Hill and will generally show up early (4-5pm), tailgate, stop drinking at kickoff, and be good to drive home once traffic clears out post game. That strategy has always worked for me."

fcdallas,22qic7,Torustorustorus,1 point,Thu Apr 10 23:39:28 2014 UTC,"And yet look at where we are on the table. Look at the 2 teams in MLS Cup last year.   While I don't want to see MLS become NASL 2.0, I think the league is still doing its best to keep that from happening. Sure we'll get our big named players who will command a lot of dough and basically be marketing tools, but as long as we're not overloading the rosters with them, we should be ok.   If Seattle still makes money by shelling out big bucks to Dempsey, so be it I guess. We'll spend 400k on Diaz or 700k on Blas and see you in the playoffs."
fcdallas,22qic7,WhoAteMyPizza,1 point,Fri Apr 11 13:50:07 2014 UTC,Actually FC Dallas spends a pretty competitive amount on salaries overall.   TFC $15.6m LAG $12.3m NYRB $10.2m SEA $9.6m VAN $5.4m MTL $4.6m FCD $4.1m   We're also one of only 6 teams to be using all 3 DP slots.
fcdallas,22qic7,soonerfan237,2,Fri Apr 11 17:17:16 2014 UTC,"We've definitely stepped our game and for pretty good reason: we're in the black and we're in a big market. And even if we are using all 3 DP spots, look at what we're spending on them."
fcdallas,22qic7,WhoAteMyPizza,1 point,Fri Apr 11 18:01:41 2014 UTC,"Probably doesn't change your point, but you are using base salary, I was using guaranteed salary. Just for reference."

fcdallas,22b7qm,huskydefender55,2,Sun Apr 6 03:02:33 2014 UTC,I just wanna know how FCD got such a terrible TV deal. Every game seems to only be on TWC-SN
fcdallas,22b7qm,jaw0012,4,Sun Apr 6 03:18:45 2014 UTC,They're also one of if not the only team that doesn't have local MLS Love blackouts so it's not all bad...
fcdallas,22b7qm,huskydefender55,2,Sun Apr 6 04:35:39 2014 UTC,This is especially crucial for season ticket holders who now have a free MLS LIve account.     I was pleasantly surprised to discover that my Pnansonic smart TV had a MLS Live app.  Works very well and I get to watch any games I can't attend.
fcdallas,22aq16,Wmdalford,2,Sat Apr 5 21:12:32 2014 UTC,"You line up and the get to walk in a line from end to end across the pitch. If you love the game, fc dallas or you have kids who do its well worth it"
fcdallas,22aq16,totspur1982,1 point,Sat Apr 5 21:22:10 2014 UTC,thanks for the reply.  Are the players warming up when you get to walk on the pitch?
fcdallas,22aq16,totspur1982,2,Sat Apr 5 21:27:04 2014 UTC,They weren't when I did it. To let you know I was 30 when I went with my wife. It was a birthday present. I was pretty excited and it was worth it. The ticket office at FCD contacted us and continued to hook us up with deals on tickets which ultimately led to us becoming season ticket holders. But we sat in Club 96 3 or 4 times just because they hooked us up. It can be a really good deal.
fcdallas,22aq16,jord4nrob,1 point,Sat Apr 5 21:47:36 2014 UTC,Unfortunately not. The players go into the locker rooms and then you get to walk the pitch right before the players walk out for the introductions.

fcdallas,21lrdb,huskydefender55,1 point,Sat Mar 29 04:34:04 2014 UTC,"Silver lining is, there might be a reason for his poor play and it doesn't sound serious."
fcdallas,21c1vu,b0xors,1 point,Tue Mar 25 16:53:05 2014 UTC,"I'm kind of surprised. Last year when we held 1st for nearly the first half of the season the power rankings didn't put us at #1 until the 5th or 6th week out.  Sure, we went on to 8th place at the end of the season, but it's a power ranking, things will change week in and week out."
fcdallas,219ctw,satellitebob,2,Mon Mar 24 20:22:37 2014 UTC,"Castillo is finally becoming what we thought he might be.  I don't know if it's the addition of Pareja, Escobar, or just maturing, but he has to scare the hell out of most defenders."
fcdallas,219ctw,perkited,2,Mon Mar 24 20:33:35 2014 UTC,"All it took was a little coaching. I find it hard to believe that Hyndman wasn't trying to keep Castillo from dribbling to the end line, but I don't know. It may have been an instance of the team just quitting on him as well. Either way, we've seen what we never saw last year, individuals clearly changing their play for the better. No more resting on laurels and getting lucky in set pieces, there is some fine play happening and I'm pretty excited about it.  edit: Granted some of our set pieces are beautiful balls by Michel. I wouldn't take that away from him, but you can't live on that for an entire season."
fcdallas,219ctw,Medoingreddit,3,Tue Mar 25 00:50:41 2014 UTC,"While he's got a lot of talent he's incredibly frustrating to watch by always trying to make things happen on his own. Granted, it's worked out for him a few times but the times it doesn't I always catch myself getting pissed off when he gets the ball taken away or carries the ball over the endline for a goal kick."
fcdallas,219ctw,Draecon,2,Tue Mar 25 02:07:34 2014 UTC,"Oh I agree. I think he gave the ball away 22 times vs. Montreal. That's all it took before Pareja put the clamps on him, moved him around in the formation, and he went from zero to hero. Only time will tell if it's permanent or an anomaly though. I've never seen him provide such good service, and none of them were from the end line."
fcdallas,216nfa,Draecon,3,Sun Mar 23 23:06:58 2014 UTC,"He has been just as reliable as George John. He is a fantastic CB and has been since day 1 with very few exceptions.  I notice him every game clearing balls out of the box or heading over-the-top balls back to our central defenders and away from the opponent's strikers.  With that being said, I'm not sure if he is of the quality of the current USMNT select CB's Gonzalez and Besler. I think John is better prepared to go to the national team over Hedges, and John brings more experience.  With all of that being said, it's a bit late to add a new name to the USMNT roster. I doubt Klinsmann has any doubt over the current CB starters or their backups."
fcdallas,216nfa,b0xors,2,Mon Mar 24 01:23:03 2014 UTC,"Yeah, he's not ready and it's too late for a call up but it's still awesome to see Pareja praise him so highly."
fcdallas,216nfa,huskydefender55,3,Mon Mar 24 02:22:47 2014 UTC,"Hedges is still pretty young though, and I could definitely see him going in 2018 if he keeps this up."
fcdallas,216nfa,parsac58,1 point,Mon Mar 24 02:31:51 2014 UTC,"The fact that Hedges has absolutely no international experience combined with the WC being only 80 or 90 days away will almost certainly prevent him from forcing his way into the 23. With that said, he has definitely been stronger than Besler and Gonzalez so far this year. Hedges beat Besler's frighteningly poor marking to score the tying goal against KC. Besler also got scorched against Cruz Azul. Gonzalez looked shaky against RSL and Tijuana.  I think there's at least a fair amount of uncertainty with Onyewu playing well with Sheffield Wednesday and Gonzalez and Besler's penchant for lapses in concentration. I don't know how Clarence Goodsen has been playing this season, but he's a possibility. From my point of view it seems tempting to play Cameron as a CB. I don't see that happening, though."
fcdallas,2169ag,Wildcat427,3,Sun Mar 23 20:36:34 2014 UTC,"When our defense is healthy I feel we will be a good team. Attacking is sharp, easy to say finishing should be better after last night but no complaints from me. Im excited to see how this season goes"
fcdallas,2169ag,dobetterthanthat,2,Sun Mar 23 20:45:08 2014 UTC,"Attaking needs to sharpen up, obviously,  but this team could be very good. From my seat last I was in a direct line with the through ball that Diaz put through for Watson. Mauro is going to be a nightmare for defenses to deal with. Hendry Thomas is a tank and one John comes back in I think the back line will be as good as any. The 4-3-3 we're playing looks to really suit us with 2 CDMs, Mauro as the engine and 2 wing backs pushing forward in attack. I'm not saying we can win the league or anything but this is a very good team and nobody is goingnto come here expecting an easy win. I would still like to see FCD go for a young LB. I love Benitez but he's getting older and will need replacing soon."
fcdallas,2169ag,totspur1982,2,Mon Mar 24 03:19:26 2014 UTC,"I'm hopefully optimistic.  Seems like we could be on the ""better"" end of our preseason predictions, considering it was impossible to project how we would do after this offseason's overhaul.  Make the playoffs and anything can happen.  We've really got some potential for being a lock-down defensive team if John could stay healthy.  And I agree with /u/totspur1982 that our formation really seems to suit our personnel."
fcdallas,2169ag,parsac58,2,Mon Mar 24 14:50:08 2014 UTC,"Castillo is putting it all together, and it is striking fear into any opponent that is paying attention. He looks unstoppable for long stretches of games. He runs and runs and runs and never seems to get tired.  Matt Hedges has looked stellar. Kellyn Acosta is looking like a veteran. Michel has of course contributed his set pieces off the bench, which have been crucial. Diaz has shown moments of brilliance with his own set piece goal and his ""awareness of contact"" to draw the penalty. He does seem to drift out of the game at times.  With John getting back soon (hopefully) we look set to make waves this season. In spite of the fact that we have started strong only to fade the past couple seasons, this team feels much more in control of games and overall stronger."

fcdallas,2117au,Episcapagan,5,Sat Mar 22 20:12:17 2014 UTC,"After tailgating in different spots for passed 7 years, I think this is the best spot for it. It's right next to a field the usually has lines on the ground for a pick up game, it doesn't have as much heat reflecting back at us during the summer, and maybe most important (since we've taken that area), that's where they've out the port-o-johns!  Absolutely we're a friendly bunch! Pop over and introduce yourself. There's usually a keg and it usually has a decent beer, grab a bite to eat, etc.  Just don't wear orange!  Edit: typo"

I don't know the specifics of what's wrong with him but it can't be good.  He cut the weight he needed and made a real attempt... but things just didn't work out.  Good luck Hassli!"
fcdallas,1zrzf7,madcow36,7,Fri Mar 7 02:44:43 2014 UTC,If they did away with the blue on the Advocare logo I think it would look soo much better. Here's an example of what I mean.

Hell, if we finished with about the same amount of points as 2013 I wouldn't even be mad.

fcdallas,1xmnaf,TheWrightMatt,1 point,Tue Feb 11 17:44:47 2014 UTC,He seemed perfectly healthy when I saw him before the team headed out to UAE but I just started a few weeks ago so I haven't had much one on one time with the players
fcdallas,1xmnaf,danny_b87,1 point,Tue Feb 11 18:52:11 2014 UTC,I really hope he stays healthy and we can see him in a starting lineup.  The guy has lost weight and looks fit (outside of not seeing him play yet) and we know from his past teams that he has skills. I think it's just that most people (including myself) feel cheated out of having him contribute so little last year with the salary rate he is at.  But back issues are a not fun.. hell I have an awful back at a young age so I can relate.  I hope for his sake and the teams that he gets to show off his talent this year.

fcdallas,1xg6kx,WhoAteMyPizza,1 point,Sun Feb 9 19:51:56 2014 UTC,I am down.  Just awaiting the details.
fcdallas,1xg6kx,devish,1 point,Mon Feb 10 01:56:05 2014 UTC,wow that sounds awesome
fcdallas,1xg6kx,phantomknight,1 point,Mon Feb 10 05:25:16 2014 UTC,Have they made any announcement for this
fcdallas,1xg6kx,WhoAteMyPizza,1 point,Mon Mar 10 22:43:07 2014 UTC,Apparently its not happening this year. All the eggs are being put in the KC basket.
fcdallas,1xg6kx,devish,1 point,Mon Mar 10 23:37:43 2014 UTC,I'm not even sure if they have gone on sale yet.  I've been trying to keep an eye on them as well.
fcdallas,1xg6kx,jord4nrob,1 point,Sun Feb 9 19:44:58 2014 UTC,Home or away? On the FCD website they are now selling single game tickets.
fcdallas,1xg6kx,devish,1 point,Mon Feb 10 03:05:24 2014 UTC,We only play Houston away this year.
fcdallas,1xg6kx,jord4nrob,1 point,Mon Feb 10 17:20:23 2014 UTC,Oh wow. I guess I've failed to look at the schedule. Thanks for the news.
fcdallas,1x7yvx,satellitebob,1 point,Thu Feb 6 22:52:34 2014 UTC,I didn't. Thanks for the post.
fcdallas,1x7yvx,HealthHazard,1 point,Fri Feb 7 14:34:33 2014 UTC,My Ft Worth friends are getting excited but its NPSL....I just wouldn't get overly excited.
fcdallas,1wkez1,vichuck,1 point,Thu Jan 30 16:46:42 2014 UTC,I wonder who he thinks could be heading to MLS?  Maybe it was Jermaine Jones (before he went to Turkey)?
fcdallas,1wkez1,perkited,1 point,Fri Jan 31 01:41:03 2014 UTC,"Supposedly we were interested in both him and Edu, but not as much as other clubs.  I too am interested.  Especially since the club keeps going on about central midfielders.  Maybe Klestjan [/purespeculation]"

fcdallas,1whzzu,TweetPoster,1 point,Wed Jan 29 21:47:02 2014 UTC,Well looks like they deleted the tweet. Follow up tweet I saw said I wasn't going to be a DP and instead a Diaz backup.
fcdallas,1whzzu,Draecon,2,Thu Jan 30 03:19:48 2014 UTC,"I'm anxious to see more from Diaz than anyone else. I think he's got the most potential and without having to share minutes with Ferreira, we'll finally see him at his best"
fcdallas,1wieiq,TheWrightMatt,1 point,Thu Jan 30 00:04:15 2014 UTC,I was curious as to why some of them weren't practicing on Saturday. Hopefully they'll be completely healthy by March 8th.
fcdallas,1wh5gf,satellitebob,4,Wed Jan 29 16:58:52 2014 UTC,"I refuse to be a walking advertisement for a pyramid scheme.  Thus, I will wait until this team has a new shirt sponsor to every buy one."
fcdallas,1wh5gf,MaverickTTT,2,Wed Jan 29 18:57:11 2014 UTC,"Pyramid scheme or not, ever tried their spark energy drink? It's replaced coffee for me, i love that shit."
fcdallas,1wh5gf,WhoAteMyPizza,2,Wed Jan 29 19:05:27 2014 UTC,I haven't.  Coffee is my crack.  It would have to be the most amazing beverage ever to replace it.
fcdallas,1wh5gf,MaverickTTT,2,Wed Jan 29 19:08:37 2014 UTC,"I bought home and away jerseys as soon as it was announced that they were closing in on a jersey sponsor and was even happier that I did so after Advocare was revealed as the sponsor. I know the money from sponsors is good for the club, but for fan jerseys I don't want an advertisement on it at all, especially given their cost."
fcdallas,1wh5gf,bravoavocado,2,Wed Jan 29 21:38:36 2014 UTC,"As far as my experiences with kit reveals go, a little photo of a sleeve is nothing to by. The sleeves now are solid red, all I can see is maybe a darker shade of red, maybe one that resembles RSL.   I'd personally like to see Red + Blue hoops with a white outline between the hoops, that'd be cool. Then a White road kit with red + blue detailing (if you look for the FC Basel current away kit that is what I'm thinking like)"
fcdallas,1wh5gf,DanJonMor,1 point,Wed Jan 29 20:36:17 2014 UTC,I was basing the no hoops on the background of this. Looks like red on red.   SMU has red/blue hoops
fcdallas,1wh5gf,HealthHazard,1 point,Wed Jan 29 21:23:25 2014 UTC,I hope not.
fcdallas,1w1e86,TheWrightMatt,2,Fri Jan 24 15:48:43 2014 UTC,Yay! I'm so excited for this upcoming season
fcdallas,1vz55w,DanJonMor,7,Thu Jan 23 21:37:16 2014 UTC,For future reference (and I mean this with sincerity and with no malicious intent): there's a sizable difference between re-sign and resign.
fcdallas,1vz55w,MaverickTTT,3,Thu Jan 23 22:47:32 2014 UTC,it gets me every time... HE WHAT WHY????
fcdallas,1vz55w,satellitebob,4,Fri Jan 24 00:18:47 2014 UTC,"How bout that favorite player tag you got there, eh?"
fcdallas,1vz55w,WhoAteMyPizza,2,Fri Jan 24 14:53:32 2014 UTC,"I will change it when the roster is finalized.... It's another reason I don't get names on the back of my jerseys.  edit: I'd like to see him re-sign, but it would be a weird place for him, I think, going from the face of the franchise #10 to just a guy coming off the bench."
fcdallas,1vz55w,satellitebob,2,Fri Jan 24 16:34:37 2014 UTC,Damn the injuries.
fcdallas,1vz55w,parsac58,2,Sun Jan 26 04:07:56 2014 UTC,"I really, really hope he stays healthy.  We were a different team the few games he was able to play at the end of the season, it's sad to think about what might have been."

fcdallas,1vz3eq,vichuck,1 point,Thu Jan 23 21:21:21 2014 UTC,I hope he is given the players to run the system. It seemed during Hyndman's time we were always 1 player away from running his system.
fcdallas,1vz3eq,satellitebob,1 point,Thu Jan 23 21:51:12 2014 UTC,"“I would like to have a player that can glue things in the middle, he can dictate our work ethics in there defensively,” described Pareja. “A player who can link and a player who can back the team from that zone. I would say that is probably one of the most important pieces that we need to add in this moment.”   I like the thought of switching to a 4-3-3 if we have the attacking players to pull it off.  Regarding the quote, I thought Luccin would be considered that guy but maybe they're thinking of a Michael Bradley-lite type player (he does mention box-to-box)."
fcdallas,1vv62i,satellitebob,1 point,Wed Jan 22 17:42:21 2014 UTC,"Hope he gets some more playing time this year, seems like a stand up guy."
fcdallas,1vsdd6,satellitebob,3,Tue Jan 21 20:09:09 2014 UTC,I need someone to tell me how to feel.
fcdallas,1vsdd6,TheWrightMatt,1 point,Wed Jan 22 15:54:14 2014 UTC,I'm going with the feeling that no one wanted to trade for allocation money so they had to pick someone. So go with defenders.
fcdallas,1vsdd6,Draecon,2,Wed Jan 22 17:28:34 2014 UTC,I don't know anything about Nicholas Walker but he followed me on Twitter so he already earned some points with me...
fcdallas,1vsdd6,iamchip,1 point,Wed Jan 22 23:23:22 2014 UTC,Defenders have the highest success rate so it was a safe bet

fcdallas,1vrlav,WhoAteMyPizza,3,Tue Jan 21 17:53:01 2014 UTC,I'm watching the archived video and the first 30 or so minutes are absolutely riveting.
fcdallas,1vpray,Wildcat427,2,Mon Jan 20 23:44:58 2014 UTC,"Not an overly surprising move IMO but nice to see they named a president finally, just in time for tomorrow's media day. He usually engages with the fans which I think is pretty awesome."
