Maybe 8 now if Chicago's the first. God forbid Detroit needs 4 or even 5!  The only first overalls to win a cup since 04 have been Crosby and Kane. And that's because Edmonton was a dysfunctional organization and not only kept taking 1st overall, but kept doing nothing with it. More 1st overalls might have won more cups if not for this fact. Couldn't be happier for their future.  Going back one NHL year before, MAF is included in that list. Before him Lecavelier ('98). Doughty was 2nd overall to Stammer."

stevedangle,3bosuv,ladykel,1 point,Tue Jun 30 23:36:46 2015 UTC,And clarification on my babies / muffins question. I included the second point for a reason.   Of course it would be better to have a second team in your hometown than possibly eating babies mistakenly for the rest of your life. Making Shane the head coach of the team means there is a downside to it. Now you have to balance your desire with having more professional hockey in your hometown with your hatred of Shane; all while having to consider the possibility of seeing babies on display in Tim Hortons or McDonalds.

My program covers the Nepean Raiders of the CCHL, and Zach played for the Smiths Falls Bears, also of the CCHL. Come playoff time, we totally covered the Bears. Zach was a a great secondary producer on the Bears, who were stacked. Top line player on any other team, totally deserved to graduate to the Soo. He was always pretty good about getting open and finding the net. If I had to make a comparison, as a Sens fan among Leafs fans, I'd say he reminds me of Clarke MacArthur. I love Zach, and I think that if he develops correctly, he can score 30+ in the NHL. But trading Hamilton and using a first round pick to get him? Absolutely not. NO. WAY. I really hope Zach does well, I LOVE seeing CCHL alumni pan out.   Anyways, sorry for the essay, I just was listening to the podcast, and figured I could pass that info along as someone who's seen Zach play a lot. Love the podcast, love you guys <3"

Obviously they can't keep Voynov on suspension for the rest of his career.   Also in regard to the ""termination"" of Richards contract based on a conditioning assignment after the season (as far as we know) do you believe the NHLPA will fight tooth and nail for Richards and eventually put that cap hit back on the Kings salary along with the possibility of paying a fine?  It just seems like such a ticky tack clause they are taking advantage of, especially since so many other NHLers choose to spend the summer with family/ friends instead of workout all the time."
