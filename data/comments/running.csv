running,3e2c3p,agapornis,4,Tue Jul 21 14:52:08 2015 UTC,This just dawned on me. I'd like to suggest maybe finding the backdrop as the LAST step that way you can determine what would fit best based upon the submissions you've been given for people's photos. It would be much easier to take a group of people and put them on a background once they are assembled than find a background and then need to squeeze in some folks if you get too many submissions. I know this screws up your plan but I'll add a few back drops just to say I did.   Random #1  Random #2  Random #3 Corral!!!
running,3e2c3p,kkruns,3,Tue Jul 21 12:45:49 2015 UTC,Thanks for the photos! The reason why I was thinking of having a backdrop because i'd know straight away if a certain photo was going to work with the backdrop. For example the mock photo for /u/esjay_ (the guy second from last) doesn't suit that background 100%. However I also like your idea and might end up doing it instead!

I have to watch how late I take it (I have to stop before 3pm or I won't sleep at all).

At most, that means about 60mg an hour, but it's most often more like 20-40mg an hour.  I haven't noticed any issues.

Nothing I am incapable of doing. However, each and every time, no matter what the distance, the moment I hit 18-21 miles, my body rebels with debilitating waves of nausea. I had to throw in the towel at ~24 miles because I didn't want to finish walking. I realized that this time, I had had quite a bit of caffeine over the course of the day and while running it and I'm just trying to see if it may be a contributing factor or if it was due to overexertion due to a high heart rate or rise in core temp. I'm really not sure. Just trying to see what other's experiences are with too much caffeine and how it effected their running."
running,3e29c0,Despoena,2,Tue Jul 21 13:43:48 2015 UTC,"I suspect that may have at least played a factor in it. With caffeine's notorious effect on the digestive tract, it could at least play a part."

This is my plan for the week, please help me revise:  I am training for my first half.  My usual routine would be to run in the mornings; no food, no coffee, maybe just a glass of water beforehand.  This worked out great until I started getting into the 10 mile+ range....now I'm starting to hit major walls on runs so I figure it has to be nutrition.    I want to start working on 3 aspects of run-day nutrition and hopefully dial in what works best for me before the half (Newport Half, Jersey City 9/20).     Pre- Run food. Mid-Run food. Mid-Run drink.    I bought a 10oz handheld water bottle, a variety pack of Gu and some Medjool dates.   Some stats about me:  I'm not a 'runner' in terms of physique. I'm about 5'10"" 205lbs.  I'm running to lose weight, and it's working, but slowly. (Started at 220 in February).  On average according to the map my run/runners world calorie calculators I burn between 160 and 170 calories per mile at my current weight.    My current MyFitnessPal track is I eat 1360 calories per day plus workouts.    Here is my plan for my long run (11 miles) this Satruday.  On Friday I will eat 1860 calories (500 over my daily quota) of lean protein and pasta/rice.  Wake up in the morning and have a piece of toast and jam (150 calories or so).   Fill my water bottle with gatorade (65 calories).  Bring with me 2 Gus  (200 calories), and 4 dates (250 calories).  That means during my run i will consume 515 calories, plus the 150 before the run plus the 500 surplus from the day before for a total of 1165 calories of the ~1815 I will burn on the run.    Is that good?  Is my math good in applying yesterday's surplus?     Also, my GUs are either 0 mg caff, 20, or 40. Not sure how that will affect me, so I'm thinking of taking a 0 and a 20 to start.  ON a given work day i drink a bunch of coffee, so I have some form of a tolerance.  Just not sure how that will translate to caffeine consumed in any other form. (thinking about how 3 glasses of wine affects vs. my usual whiskey consumption).    Please, tell me where I'm wrong or how I can make this better.   TL;DR   Hitting a wall in my 10+ runs.  I laid out my plan for this week, looking for revision.  Thanks!"
running,3e29c0,SouthernAvocado,3,Tue Jul 21 14:59:11 2015 UTC,"For a half marathon distance I find it doesn't really matter how many calories I ingest the day before/night before but more of WHAT I'm consuming, just so I don't do something stupid like eat a ton of dairy or high fat. I do get your concerns, and for training runs you might want to play with one variable at a time instead of trying everything at once.   One week try the extra calories from the day prior and whatever you had been consuming immediately prior to your LR (if anything). Then see how you feel. Next time try pre-run fueling and some fueling during. This will help you pinpoint what part of the fueling you should focus on (without just ingesting a shit ton of extra calories when you are trying to cut). It really takes time to work out the best fueling for YOU, just look at it like a science experiment and try not to throw everything at the wall at once.   I found I only really needed to focus on pre-run fueling and adding a couple of Gus during if I was getting up past 11 miles. A couple of bananas 15 minutes before my LRs are great, easy to digest, and still full of sugar.   You're on the right track, good luck!"

running,3e29c0,Waksman,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:16:36 2015 UTC,"For me nutrition matters more on an aggregate level. I was running with a calorie deficit (accidentally, as strange as that may sound, my appetite didn't go up much with additional mileage over 20mpw ) and I was running out of steam all the time. I couldn't really make progress. Once I started eating more all the time, I quite running out of steam and started getting faster. I do have a 400 cal drink/smoothy before my runs and will drink some gatorade during long runs (12ish miles for me). IMO, I think you're better of doing the weight lifting bulk/cut type cycles, i.e. don't try and lose weight while increasing mileage and then do a cycle where you try and maintain mileage while focusing on losing weight. EDIT: I do think you can lose weight while running, but it has to be VERY slow not to damage training."
running,3e29c0,Reputablevendor,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:29:35 2015 UTC,"Not a dietician by any means, but I wonder if 1350 is too low for you. I'm eating to lose weight right now as well, and it's very tempting to speed things along by having a larger caloric deficit, but I've found that if you go too low, your body will really try to hang onto your fat, and the long runs are harder to complete.  You might try bumping up your intake a couple hundred calories/day and see how that affects both your weight loss and your long runs.  If you are well stocked with glycogen, you should have plenty of fuel for a 10-11 miler without eating during the run. I always have a banana or piece of toast before going because it feels weird to not eat after going overnight fasting, but I don't know if it is necessary."
running,3e29c0,Dirtybritch,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:19:57 2015 UTC,How many calories (if any) should I be looking to take in on a 35 k trail run?
running,3e29c0,YourShoesUntied,6,Tue Jul 21 12:25:07 2015 UTC,"For me, I estimate that I burn ~125 cal per mile or ~80 cal per kilometer (for those of you who don't use Freedom Units.) So over the course of the 35k, I'd expect to burn ~2,800 cal.   This is something totally up to you. In racing situations, my non-calorie limit is usually around 3 hours before I have to eat something so personally, I probably wouldn't need anything for a 35k. Trail runs usually force you to focus a bit more on the task at hand which helps distract you from the hunger you may get as well. If I were you, I'd pack a single, high calorie meal replacement bar or some sort of high calorie fuel source and leave it at that. Use it when you feel you NEED to and if you don't use it than so be it. With the adrenaline and energy you have, you probably won't need anything more than hydration. Of course everyone is different so this is just my bit."
running,3e29c0,Dirtybritch,2,Tue Jul 21 12:34:17 2015 UTC,Thanks for the input! I didn't really think I would need much as I don't need anything for half marathon distance. Was thinking of just bringing a gel or two just in case and kinda see how I fare. I wanted to see what others recommend even though I know nutrition is a pretty personal thing. What about 50k distance shoes? You a gel guy or a real food guy?
running,3e29c0,YourShoesUntied,2,Tue Jul 21 13:24:19 2015 UTC,"I've been trying to ween off of gels. I've discovered that the sugary consistency gets my stomach queezy. Lately, solid food has been a better route. Slim Jims, Granola bars, Protein bars, etc."

running,3e29c0,mjcii,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:49:04 2015 UTC,"It's all defendant upon gender, weight, height, bodyfat percentage, etc. No one can tell you that simply by a distance given.

I'm not even a fan of fueling during, honestly, I just know I need to start incorporating it as part of my training. I'm running 4 HMs starting at the end of August and that's going to take a toll on my body for sure.

And what's your favorite real food? Let me explain what I mean and why I'm asking.  I want to start carrying real foods with me on longer runs. I get on all right with things like GU and Tailwind, but in the later stages of a race or a long run, my stomach is telling me that it wants real food. By ""real food,"" I mean substantial solid nutrition that would give a feeling of satiety. Things like PBJ sandwiches, peanut-butter filled pretzels, medjool dates, boiled/salted potatoes, fruit, Scott Jurek's seaweed-wrapped rice balls, etc. I'd count Clif Bars, Honey Stinger Waffles, and some other such sport nutrition products as ""real food"" under my definition. I would not count Tailwind or any other sports drink, gels of any kind, GU chomps or Clif Bloks, energy beans, or other such things as ""real food"" since they aren't substantial enough to satisfy.

running,3e24hq,Ryall132,6,Tue Jul 21 13:35:56 2015 UTC,"How accurate are fitness apps at estimating how many calories burned during a workout?  Like does it assume max effort, or somewhere in the middle?  If I'm in really good shape and decide to run 4 miles at a 10 minute per mile pace, would it know that I'm not working super hard as I would if I was running at 7:30 min miles?"
running,3e24hq,Jaime_Manger,6,Tue Jul 21 12:07:05 2015 UTC,"Ehhhhhh the rule of thumb is that you burn ~100 calories per mile you run. It doesn't matter how fast/slow. Of course if you run faster, you'll be able to run more miles in the same amount of time thus burning more calories for time.  Also I totally ignore the fitness apps caloric measurement. Since I'm a smaller female I also guess closer to 80-90 calories burned per mile."
running,3e24hq,Ryall132,3,Tue Jul 21 12:58:55 2015 UTC,"Yikes, my thing tells me about 150 calories per mile.  Im 205 pounds, but 100 is a lot less then the app says."
running,3e24hq,Jaime_Manger,6,Tue Jul 21 13:05:45 2015 UTC,Ah actually 150 might be correct for your weight. It is also based on weight.   An article for you - http://www.runnersworld.com/weight-loss/how-many-calories-are-you-really-burning
running,3e24hq,Ryall132,4,Tue Jul 21 13:11:54 2015 UTC,"yeah thats pretty cool!  so the runkeeper app said that i burned 839 calories, and the formula given in the article says 639.45.  Good thing i was under for the day lol.  If it is such a simple formula, why are these apps so inaccurate?"
running,3e24hq,craigster38,4,Tue Jul 21 13:28:51 2015 UTC,"Cause it's not really a simple formula. 100 calories per mile is a safe guess, but it's only a guess."
running,3e24hq,Ryall132,4,Tue Jul 21 14:31:59 2015 UTC,On the site it says the net calories=your weight x .63 per mile burned

running,3e24hq,kkruns,2,Tue Jul 21 16:54:04 2015 UTC,"I'm a 5'4"" 118lb female and any HR monitor-based caloric burn puts me at about 70-75 calories per mile. It's really kind of depressing when I see how many calories other people burn. That means I have to run more than a 10K just to deserve a Shake Burger. And another 5K to deserve half an order of fries."
running,3e24hq,TannusCorwin,4,Tue Jul 21 18:29:59 2015 UTC,"Its pretty much a crap shot. It uses your weight and the distance you run in a formula to calculate the number of calories burned. You will never get an an accurate answer.   For Example - as a 160 lb male, for a 5 mile run, on Runkeeper its about 670 calories, on Myfitnesspal, its about 720 calories, and on Strava, its about 735 calories burned. They are close, but not the same.  My general rule is if you are looking to eat back your running calories, is to shoot for 75% of the reported burn. That should leave you with a cushion due to inaccuracy."
running,3e24hq,Ryall132,4,Tue Jul 21 12:58:08 2015 UTC,"yeah thats a good rule of thumb.  Usually I run because its easier to hit my target calories for weight loss, so Ill start doing this!"
running,3e24hq,ChickenSedan,4,Tue Jul 21 13:07:30 2015 UTC,Calories burnt is more of a function of body weight and distance traveled. Speed plays a much smaller role.   Your calories burnt at 10:00 min/mi pace is very similar to 7:30 min/mi pace for the same distance traveled.
running,3e24hq,Ryall132,5,Tue Jul 21 13:02:29 2015 UTC,"ah, that makes more sense.  Because with pace if you're working harder, you aren't working as long I suppose."
running,3e24hq,abscissa80,2,Tue Jul 21 13:04:32 2015 UTC,"I wear a Garmin watch with a heart rate monitor strap when I run.  What I have noticed is that when I have a hard run with a higher average heart rate, I tend to burn many more calories per mile than when I have an easy run with a lower average heart rate. I tend to burn about 100 calories per mile when I go for a hard run versus about 75 calories per mile for easier runs."
running,3e24hq,Raumschiff,6,Tue Jul 21 18:55:50 2015 UTC,"When I started running I was exhausted after 2 miles.  Today I hardly break a sweat after 2 miles.  Do I burn the same amount of calories in a 2 mile run today as I did in the beginning, even if it takes way less effort?"
running,3e24hq,YourShoesUntied,4,Tue Jul 21 12:49:46 2015 UTC,"For the most part yes. You might be lighter and your form might be better but unless both of those things have changed drastically, you are still probably burning close to what you were towards the beginning."
running,3e24hq,Despoena,4,Tue Jul 21 12:52:14 2015 UTC,"I think there are more factors involved than just effort - time spent working out, your weight, etc, all play a factor in calories burned. I've heard the general rule is 100 calories burned per mile run but calorie estimates can vary so widely it's hard to pinpoint.   http://www.runnersworld.com/weight-loss/how-many-calories-are-you-really-burning   In ""Energy Expenditure of Walking and Running,"" published last December in Medicine & Science in Sports & Exercise, a group of Syracuse University researchers measured the actual calorie burn of 12 men and 12 women while running and walking 1,600 meters (roughly a mile) on a treadmill. Result: The men burned an average of 124 calories while running, and just 88 while walking; the women burned 105 and 74. (The men burned more than the women because they weighed more.)   Not sure if that's really related but I found it interesting."
running,3e24hq,runwithpugs,3,Tue Jul 21 13:06:51 2015 UTC,"From this article:   One study published in the Journal of Applied Physiology determined that well-trained runners burn five to seven percent fewer calories than their nonathletic counterparts. A run you did as a newbie athlete that burned 500 calories, for example, might burn 465 to 475 calories when you’re better trained, assuming you’ve stayed the same weight."
running,3e24hq,hgca,5,Tue Jul 21 16:38:53 2015 UTC,"Is there a major difference between hiking shoes, trail running shoes, and winter running shoes?   I am going on a hiking trip in a couple weeks and am considering running some of the trails, as well. I don't have a solid winter running shoe (suitable for Real Canadian Winters), and am wondering if it is feasible to get something that covers all 3 activities."
running,3e24hq,CatzerzMcGee,4,Tue Jul 21 13:50:12 2015 UTC,"Winter running shoes usually come in a ""GoreTex"" version. The upper is made with a material that is slightly heavier, but repels water up to a point.   Trail shoes can come with Gore Tex, but they usually have a sort of lug or grip on the bottom as well as a rock plate underneath your forefoot to prevent damage from stepping on rocks.   Hiking shoes are going to be much more stiff, have a higher collar, and be much heavier. However, they should be more durable."
running,3e24hq,hgca,3,Tue Jul 21 14:35:25 2015 UTC,"Thanks!  So a pair of trail runners could be suitable for hikes (I will not be wearing a heavy pack, or going out for longer 4-6 hours), but I might need something a little different for winter road running?"
running,3e24hq,CatzerzMcGee,3,Tue Jul 21 14:49:46 2015 UTC,"Yes trail shoes would be a good option for hikes. If you're going to be on the roads during the winters a regular road running shoe but in the ""winterized"" version would be a good choice as well."
running,3e24hq,purepajamas,4,Tue Jul 21 14:54:32 2015 UTC,I have a general question for those who like to race. Do you run the same races over the years or do prefer running new races?
running,3e24hq,YourShoesUntied,6,Tue Jul 21 11:53:56 2015 UTC,"At this point, I'm a fan of trying one new big race each year and just sticking to the ones I know. That'll have to change eventually but in the last year, I've ran 2 ultras that were in their first year and I'd love to get a streak going on attending everyone since their beginning so that sort of outweighs finding new ones."
running,3e24hq,Penny_girl,3,Tue Jul 21 12:11:17 2015 UTC,"Sigh. I'm always replying to you, shoes!  My favorite (it's hometown, super hilly, and the first one I ever did) 50k just had its 20th running, it was my 6th time. This race gives awards for completing a certain number of years...they have a local artist make pottery, and for 5 years you get a coffee mug, 10 you get a bowl, 15 a platter. This year 3 people ran it for the 20th time, and received a custom-made...urn. For their ashes."
running,3e24hq,YourShoesUntied,2,Tue Jul 21 16:15:28 2015 UTC,"I think it's neat that races honor the returning runners. In my eyes they deserve a special kind of honor. They may not be the people at the end of the race getting the trophy or standing on the podium but year after year they run the race, pay their dues and help make the race what it is. That's really cool of the race to do that."
running,3e24hq,craigster38,4,Tue Jul 21 17:50:11 2015 UTC,"It varies.  I usually like to do new races, only because there are so many.  Occasionally, I'll do the same ones over and over, but then one year I'll take a break.  Like this year, there are at least 3 races I've done the past 3 years but haven't signed up for this year. I probably wont sign up for any of them. I could fit them into my schedule, but I decided not to this year."
running,3e24hq,incster,3,Tue Jul 21 11:59:34 2015 UTC,"I do some of both. I like to try new races, but If I really like a race, I will do it again and again. For some races, especially trail races or road races with lots of hills, you get a big advantage by knowing the course. It is also a great way to check your progress year to year."
running,3e24hq,Despoena,3,Tue Jul 21 12:01:22 2015 UTC,"I'll be running the HM version of my first race later in August, but for the most part I prefer new races! I'll probably do the bigger what I call ""party races"" again because more of my friends go to those, but for the smaller runs I like the variety."
running,3e24hq,TannusCorwin,3,Tue Jul 21 12:27:47 2015 UTC,"Depends on well the race is organized. There are some races where the atmosphere is fun, crowd is good, and I have a good time, so I will race again the next year. There are other races I have been to, that make it seem like it is amateur hour. Late starts, no organization, no one knows where to check in at. I don't come back for those. I do like to try at least 2 or 3 new races a year. Those that are awesome make the comeback list, at least until they jack up the price to absurd levels......"
running,3e24hq,Sacamato,3,Tue Jul 21 13:01:35 2015 UTC,"I've found a few that I will do every year. There's a local half marathon on a fast course that I do every year, if I can. I'll do the Richmond, VA half or full every year, because it gives me an excuse to visit and run with a friend of mine who lives there. There's a local 5k in March that's on a fast course, and usually pretty cold, so it's my best chance for a personal best. There's a local mile race every September, and mile road races are so rare, so I always do that one.  Other than those, I do like shaking it up a bit, just to try new races."
running,3e24hq,runwithpugs,3,Tue Jul 21 13:44:16 2015 UTC,"A little of both. I get sucked in by legacy runner benefits that some races offer, so I usually do those every year to maintain legacy status (fell for it again!). And there are a few that are really fun / well-run that I like to support as well. Actually, I've done enough good races over the last 5 years that if I did them all again every year, I'd be doing 2-4 races a month... and that's too much!  But I'm really looking to start branching out and doing new things. Particularly, I'm looking to travel and do interesting races in different places. I've got a race bucket list, plus I'm always up for smaller/closer ones that are new to me, especially if some friends are going.  More and more, I'm interested in unique experiences and not necessarily the well-run but cookie cutter races."
running,3e24hq,purepajamas,2,Tue Jul 21 16:30:02 2015 UTC,"Answering my own question, I like new ones but I see myself going back to the ones I have done before just to make sure to run it faster than the previous years."
running,3e24hq,kkruns,2,Tue Jul 21 12:42:40 2015 UTC,"For me it varies by distance. I want to run a lot of different marathons, so you won't see me repeating many of those (except maybe NYCM). If also yet to run the same half marathon twice, but that is likely to change, just for convenience. Any smaller races, I have no issues running them over and over. I've run one 5 mile race for three straight years now."
running,3e24hq,PigletChops,2,Tue Jul 21 18:34:42 2015 UTC,"I prefer new races but that's because I'm working on completing a marathon in all 50 states. I also like to run a race if I'm staying in a location for any extended amount of time.  However, I run the Boston marathon each year and sometimes try to do super cheap local races when they occur each year."
running,3e24hq,ThePicardIsAngry,4,Tue Jul 21 19:29:13 2015 UTC,"I'm training for a half marathon in 8 weeks' time, not following any specific training plan. At the moment my long run is 10 miles and it nearly kills me. I've noticed that some training plans alternate the long runs each week (e.g. 10 miles as the long run one week, 5 miles as the long run the next) - is this better than just steadily increasing each week? What's the benefit of doing that?"
running,3e24hq,YourShoesUntied,4,Tue Jul 21 12:33:06 2015 UTC,"Steadily increasing each week doesn't allow your body time to adjust properly and get the rest it needs. There's a reason why plans have a down week thrown in now and then. This also reduces the potential for injury and overuse during a training cycle. It's typically okay to gradually increase your distance if you are physically familiar with the training and if it's a short span of time but if it's your first or second time around, it's best to take a week or two with low mileage and benefit from it."

running,3e24hq,google_you,3,Tue Jul 21 14:14:49 2015 UTC,"For maf-180 or heart rate limited training, is it better to run at comfortable speed then walk when monitor beeps? Or, should I be running slower and uncomfortable so that I don't have to walk?  Overall, running comfortably and walking a lot is a little bit faster than running uncomfortably slow throughout."

running,3e24hq,Liraelx,3,Tue Jul 21 12:29:30 2015 UTC,"So I've been trying to watch my cadence more over the past couple of weeks. It made a HUGE difference in my perceived effort, which is amazing. My 10k pace went from 10min/mi to 9min/mi in races two weeks apart where the second race was even in terrible 90° and humid. My question is how do I keep my cadence up and run at an easy pace for training runs? I'm trying to keep my easy runs around 11-11:30 miles and it feels painfully slow. If I keep my cadence around 170 I move faster than 11...."
running,3e24hq,Jaime_Manger,4,Tue Jul 21 13:25:54 2015 UTC,"If you want to decrease speed while keeping the same cadence you shorten your steps. Though truth be told, my cadence gets faster as I get faster. I think my cadence is around 184 on my recovery runs but 200+ during races."
running,3e24hq,Liraelx,3,Tue Jul 21 14:26:09 2015 UTC,"My stride just feels hilariously short when I go at the easy pace I'm apparently supposed to be shooting for. I feel like I'm literally just shuffling along. I just picked up the 225 this weekend, so  I'm definitely going to work more on cadence and heart rate. Wow 200+...I thought 180 felt insane when I started paying attention."

Ya know, the ones that spray every 20 minutes or so. Anyways, the article talked about just how bad chronically breathing that stuff in can be for your health. It was pretty eye opening. It touched on symptoms that it's been linked to such as headaches, increased sinus issues, aggravated air ways, and excess phlegm production. Then it went on to mention that the study showed that the air freshners might have a potential link to lowered sperm count and stuff. After reading it, I thought about it and it made a lot of sense. I'd assume that the body spray situation would be similar. I'll see if I can find the article if you are interested."

running,3e24hq,PepperoniFire,4,Tue Jul 21 11:32:08 2015 UTC,"It really depends on what you're looking for.  I love the analytics.  I don't beat myself up about cadence, for example, but I like seeing it, especially since I've been transitioning from the treadmill to the outside.  I usually hover between 178-181 spm on a treadmill, but outside I drop to the 160s and have gradually been getting it back up.  I grabbed my FR225 precisely for the heart rate monitor.  I tend to overtrain and this keeps me largely tethered to the 80/20 rule.  You don't actually need a watch to monitor this, though, but if you don't want this feature then any watch that does have it doesn't bring much to the table.  My understanding of phone tracking is that, depending on the app, it can be pretty inaccurate.  If that's a concern, then a cheap GPS watch might be in order.  With the 225 out, there should be (probably already is) price drops on the 220 and other earlier Forerunners.  Clevertraining.com has a cheap ($10?) membership that gets you a discount on all purchases (non-clearance) and frequently has deals on tons of running/cycling/swimming gear, including GPS watches.  At the end of the day, I think it's a specificity thing.  If you just want a rough holistic of your distance, time and pace, an app is probably fine, especially if your phone is small and/or you don't mind the bulk.  If you're a numbers/analytics person who really likes the tracking tailored to your running, and whose entire focus is to ensure it's as accurate and running-convenient as possible, a GPS watch can be a great quality of life improvement.  I have only had mine two weeks and I might leave my boyfriend for it (I've already told him this.)"
running,3e24hq,LyraBelacqua_,4,Tue Jul 21 12:38:37 2015 UTC,"I absolutely hate running with a phone. I find arm bands uncomfortable, and I don't listen to music when I run outside. Beyond that, the last thing I want during a run is to be interrupted by a phone call."
running,3e24hq,heidavey,3,Tue Jul 21 14:42:06 2015 UTC,"I have found that the GPS on a watch is better and also, I want to be able to use my phone in an emergency."
running,3e24hq,jennifer1911,3,Tue Jul 21 11:35:25 2015 UTC,I mostly rely on my phone to track my running data but I do have a cheap Garmin.  I use it for speedwork or tempo runs where I'm trying to keep at a certain pace over a certain distance.  It is easy to glance at my watch and make sure I'm on track - much harder to do that with my phone.
running,3e24hq,sholder89,2,Tue Jul 21 13:43:36 2015 UTC,The only reason I got one was because my phone battery wouldn't last longer than about a half marathon and I was training for a full.
running,3e24hq,PepperoniFire,6,Tue Jul 21 17:50:09 2015 UTC,"So....how do you all order shoes online?  I don't mean literally as in ""Press the 'buy' button.""  I mean, I try all my shoes on since some lines run small (as a general rule I buy a bit bigger anyway) and I want to know how it couches my foot and what the cushioning is like, etc.  Do you just try to find it in a store and then find a better deal online?  Do you like a particular shoe and keep ordering it until it goes into extinction?  Do you take a gamble on no. 10 when you liked no. 9 in a shoe line? Heart rate training.  I read 80/20 Running and a number of other Fitzgerald books.  I've only recently begun reading up on Maf a bit.  I haven't officially calculated my max heart rate - just did 220-age for the time being.  I'll remedy that next week as I'm taking this week off.  According to the 220-age measurement, my zone 2 peaks at 133 bpm.  I'll say flat out this seems almost too easy and that I ran trails for 3 hours this weekend at a height of 151 bpm in the heat and I would personally categorize it as easy, but I also know runners tend to do that for runs that 'officially' qualify as moderate intensity. ANYWAY, I ask because, according to Maf, training sub-155 bpm would be ideal.  Any thoughts on the efficacy of each of these, why they're different, and any anecdotal evidence from folks who have trained using either?"
running,3e24hq,ChickenSedan,8,Tue Jul 21 12:32:26 2015 UTC,"I'll buy the first pair of any given shoe at the local running store.   If I love it, I might buy another pair online, since I know what I'm getting.   Just don't go to the store and try things on and then buy them online. The personal care is worth the extra money."
running,3e24hq,TannusCorwin,4,Tue Jul 21 13:05:26 2015 UTC,"If I am going to try a new shoe, I try it in the store and if I was assisted by a clerk who takes the time to make sure it fits properly,etc I buy it in the store. Afterwards I know what I am looking for and purchase online.  For the next line, Its not really that much of a gamble. I usually keep a pair of shoes on standby so when I order shoes online, its to replace the standby pair. If they have to be sent back, I am not in any sort of rush to get them replaced."
running,3e24hq,MaraudingSquirrel,4,Tue Jul 21 13:04:35 2015 UTC,"If I were strictly buying online, I'd order a pair in my standard size and one pair a half-size larger with the expectation that I'd be sending one back. And I'd be buying from a store with a generous shipping and return policy, like Running Warehouse. If I were to try to find it in the local running store, I'd just buy it there because the personal care is worth the extra cost. But I'm less inclined to do this lately, since my local running store was acquired by a big corporate chain and has started to be less supportive of my local running club."

running,3e24hq,flocculus,3,Tue Jul 21 13:05:22 2015 UTC,"I gamble on shoes all the time. I've bought exactly two pairs in person (well, one, I bought the first and exchanged it for the second) and didn't like either of them, and tried on a couple others at a big box store that I never ended up buying.   For online shopping purposes, I have a pretty solid idea of what I like in a shoe, read as many reviews and comparisons as I can find, and make sure I can return it if I don't like it. All of my favorite shoes have been online purchases that I did not try on in person first."
running,3e24hq,Tweeeked,3,Tue Jul 21 13:19:12 2015 UTC,I gamble on shoes from time to time. But runningwarehouse actually has a good tool - ShoeFitr - that'll give you an idea of how a new shoe will fit on your feet compared to your current shoe.
running,3e24hq,MaraudingSquirrel,4,Tue Jul 21 14:15:49 2015 UTC,Are you sure about that ShoeFitr thing? I am looking at a very popular shoe on RW right now and there's no ShoeFitr showing up. Doesn't show up for any shoe on RW that I try either.
running,3e24hq,Tweeeked,2,Tue Jul 21 15:04:02 2015 UTC,"Whoa. I've bought before (most recent was May) and it was there. Shoefitr is its own private company so maybe RunningWarehouse cut ties. It worked great too, so that sucks."
running,3e24hq,MaraudingSquirrel,3,Tue Jul 21 15:50:08 2015 UTC,I think ShoeFitr was bought by Amazon.  You can still find ShoeFitr on Runner's World's shoe database pages and sometimes on the shoe company websites themselves. I know that Altra puts the ShoeFitr tool on some of their shoe pages.
running,3e24hq,Waksman,4,Tue Jul 21 15:54:04 2015 UTC,"The MAF formula seems silly, I don't see how a stock formula could apply to everyone. I have a weirdly high MaxHR (probably around 210-212) for a 29 year old and my perceived exertion scales with my MaxHR. I do most of my training around an average of 165 these days and I can run for hours without being breathless, tired or sore. I ran a half-marathon and my average was 188bpm (for a 2:00ish hour race time) and I think the assertion that I was running almost 40bpm over my aerobic threshold is absurd."
running,3e24hq,PepperoniFire,2,Tue Jul 21 15:18:16 2015 UTC,"Hm, my half marathon time (best) was 1:37:59 and I remember feeling pretty good after.  I guess I should at least test out my max HR before fretting over the best calculation but yeah, it tells me I'm ""high"" at 133 bpm and it feels so off, even when trying to be cognizant of the tendency to justify moderate intensity exercises."
running,3e24hq,Waksman,2,Tue Jul 21 16:49:27 2015 UTC,"Oops, I should have also added that I read 80/20 running and used an HR monitor as a guide to keep myself from running faster (now I go more by exertion), shifting my training from around 185bpm to 165-170bpm and the amount of progress I made was crazy. I was able to bump my mileage a lot and made more improvement in the last 5 months, than I did in the previous 18."

running,3e24hq,runwithpugs,3,Tue Jul 21 13:55:18 2015 UTC,"Agree. /u/flotography's story (linked above) is what motivated me to try Maffetone.  I've been doing it for about 4.5 months, and while it's been overall positive, my experience suggests that Maffetone is a little too obsessed with staying 100% aerobic, 0% anaerobic. He claims that any anaerobic work, even just a little bit, is enough to destroy any aerobic gains. I have a hard time believing this, and a lot of research contradicts this claim (it's worth noting that he hasn't really worked in the field in some time, so may not be up to date with the latest information??).  In my case, I saw pretty good improvement over the first month or two of running MAF-only. My MAF pace dropped a bit more than a minute per mile (when I first started, it was sooo sloooowww compared to what I'd been running previously). But then it seemed to plateau.  A few weeks ago, I decided to do a few hard workouts one week. And wouldn't you know it - my next 3 MAF runs were all about 20 seconds per mile faster than my previous fastest MAF.  Maffetone briefly mentions that runners who've plateaued after several months of aerobic running could benefit from a little bit of speedwork. But he almost seems to downplay that, as it doesn't fit with his narrative that running aerobic is all you need. Maybe I just got the wrong impression.  My take is that running consistently at MAF pace works, as it builds your aerobic base - something many people neglect because they spend too much time training too hard. It also helps tremendously to avoid injury and maximize recovery. But there is a real benefit to the occasional harder workout."
running,3e24hq,flocculus,3,Tue Jul 21 16:19:11 2015 UTC,"Someone posted an article recently either here or on /r/AdvancedRunning that refuted Maffetone's claim that any anaerobic work will stall aerobic process - I'll link if I can find it.   EDIT: found it!  I do like the idea of low HR training and will probably revisit it in a less stringent form at some point. I tried Maffetone's method for a month over the winter and had to shuffle so slowly to stay below my max aerobic HR that it caused my shin splints to flare up again. It certainly helped me to adjust my expectation of perceived effort for easy/recovery days, so that was a plus."

So, a few questions:  1) I lift weights twice a week, and play rec league softball and kickball two nights a week. I'm fairly certain that I could run a 5k if I wanted to right now, is Couch to 5k still a good program to get started with? If not, what is?   2) When I've run in the past, I prefer trail running to running on the road/around town, are the principles of C25k or other beginner programs applicable to trail running?  3) Is running worth it for my goals? I want to last longer while skinning up mountains. Will running a little each week (probably up to 1 hour a day for 3 days a week) help, or do I need to come up with something else?  4) What kind of running is optimal for endurance? I assume long slow hours, but I hear mixing in tempo/tabata/intervals will help? What's the ideal mix?  Thanks in advance! I hastily read through the FAQ, but when I saw the opportunity to post in the beginner thread I figured I should jump on it. My issue with the FAQ is it seems the primary goal of the sub is to improve running, whereas my primary goal is to improve endurance, and I'm wondering if those two goals are the same."

I'd pick a Hal Higdon 5k or 10k program and start there.  2) The only difference with trail running, is you need to watch where you're going.  3) Running will improve your endurance. Normally, you'll do 3-4 shorter runs, with one long run on the weekend.  4) Long/slow runs are best for endurance. Tempo/tabata/intervals are best for speed."

She has accomplished all of this despite never having the traditional runner's body. The article discusses the relationship between BMI, weight, and other conventional metrics for health with what they actually believe it means to be healthy.   Quote from the article: ""“If controlling obesity were a simple matter of calories in and calories out,” says Ludwig (Founder and Director of the New Balance Foundation Obesity Prevention Center at Boston Children's Hospital), “I would be out of a job."" ""The calories-in/calories-out idea is ridiculously simplistic,” says Freedhoff (MD, professor at the University of Ottawa's Faculty of Medicine). “It's like a financial adviser telling an investor to buy low and sell high.""

Now, doing it safetly and mitigating performance loss make it way more complicated, but if your goal is just to lose weight in vs out is absolutely the way to go. If she were to focus on diet and lose 100 pounds and not run at all, when she started running again 100 pounds lighter she would be insanely fast as compared to any pace she could train herself into whilst weighing so much.  Anyway, I have put up a few negative posts here and I feel bad about it because I am glad she is doing something positive and hope she continues to improve and does get healthy.

Week one being low as a recovery week from the 10K is fine, but peaking at 23 miles a week for a half marathon is not all that much.  You would be better prepared if you started off week 2 at 18 miles a week or so (still below overall peak), and worked your way up to 27 or more. Linear increase is also not always the best idea. Having some cut-back easier weeks in between can help your progress.  This might look like:  13 18 20 22 20 23 25 23 26 27 23 5  This would also give you a bit of a cutweek in the second last week before the race, which will help you be fresh for the race. I would recommend in that week to cut the 4 miles out of your saturday long run as it is closest to the race, and doing a very long run 7 days out won't help you much as you don't have time to fully recover."

To run a 5k in 30 minutes (which is what the app allots you), you'll need to be running 6.2 mph.  I'll get there, but not anytime soon. I'm just going to continue bumping up my mileage by 10% a week until I get to 5k, which is a little over 40 minutes of running. So it'll probably take another month.  So what?"

But the fact remains that the purpose of the programme is to get you running non-stop for 30 minutes - no more - no less!!  I can now easily run non-stop for 90 minutes - and I can easily run 10K non-stop -- BUT I still cannot run 5K in less than 30 minutes . :)    It doesn't matter !   The fact that I can run at all is amazing to both me and my elderly contemporaries!! :)"
running,3dydnf,great_cornholio_13,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:53:41 2015 UTC,I'm  glad you chimed in on this thread. I am a 62 yof and started the c25k in April. I finished weeks ago and am nowhere near a 5k yet. And if I run outside here on the Gulf Coast I have had to insert 1 or 2 short walks in my run. It's good to hear that you are running 90 minutes straight. There's hope!
running,3dydnf,realityking89,5,Tue Jul 21 03:31:08 2015 UTC,It looks like you're following the program as it was designed and you're making the good progress.  You just over halfway through and you're already running and walking just under 5km.   The frequency and duration of the walking intervals is reduced pretty quickly in the second half of the program.    The best advice I can give you is to complete the running intervals without walking no matter how slow you have to run and stick with the program.  In a few more weeks you'll be close to running the full 5km without walking.  3 days a week is definitely not too few.  The rest days in any training plan are just as important as the days you workout.
running,3dydnf,Oberheimz,2,Mon Jul 20 17:44:57 2015 UTC,"It is better not to increase training volume too quickly, since your joints and ligaments need to adapt to the increased stress that you re putting on them.  3 times a week is probably right for starting out, you can add sessions as you get stronger.   If you increase training volume too quickly or introduce speed work too soon, you risk getting injured, and setbacks like that can be discouraging."
running,3dydnf,KillerMe33,2,Mon Jul 20 18:31:20 2015 UTC,"I finished the program having done about 4.5km in 30 minutes, but once you've ran for 30 minutes, what's another few minutes to get the extra distance in.   Stick with the program, and then if you're still not there at the end of it, just keep going with the training and just up the duration until you get there."
running,3dydnf,Grophix,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:52:35 2015 UTC,"Just to give you a data point, I started runing again a little over 2 months ago and I just broke 30 min in a 5K race a week ago. I'm overweight (not obese, 200 lbs at 6'2"") not very fit, but relativly young (25), male, and I've run (badly) back in high school.  If you can do almost 5K in 30m after 5 weeks, you're doing just fine.  BTW: I didn't do C25K, I did a runkeeper plan that involved less walking and some light speed work because that was more familiar to me."

running,3e1f3v,Dejers,6,Tue Jul 21 05:31:55 2015 UTC,"Where do you feel the pain precisely? Are they shin splints or perhaps your achilles tendon?   You need to rest it out. Don't strain it in any way until the pain is completely gone. This may take 2 weeks or so. But 2 weeks now are better than 4 months if you keep going. The reason you are getting it is probably a combination. Too much stress lately (increased training, not enough regeneration, non-running parts of your life)? Perhaps not a perfect running form?

Some training methods seem to discourage doing high intensity intervals until you've been running a few methods. Sprinting might not be such a good idea? I'm no expert but perhaps you should focus on just turning your walk/run into a run before you start putting in any kind of speed-work, get to running 30mins non-stop first"

It has been above thirty of mostly the same since the beginning of the program and working upwards.   Recovered as in? I think I am recovered usually. My legs have typically thawed out and stopped hurting, and I am happy to be getting back to running again. I was marginally irritated last night because I forgot to run earlier and ended up out nearer to midnight than nine, but that quickly gave way to happiness about running.   And the intensity...

If your goal was to PR the 50 miler and just finish the marathon (as a training run), I'd say go for it, but as it stands, don't do this. I'd put your chances at tapping out on the 50 miler due to injury or just plain exhaustion at 80%.  Recovery is always overlooked as part of any functional training plan. Professional marathoners will often take two weeks off after a race, before transitioning into easy recovery weeks. What you're talking about is putting your body through the most stress you possibly can... and then doing that again, longer, on a distance you've never done and will likely botch the pace for (everyone does, it's something you get through experience).  Don't do it. Either treat your marathon as a training run and try to PR on another one 6 weeks or preferably more after the 50 miler, or cancel one of your races."

If you don't have a ton of miles in your legs over a bunch of years, it's gonna be tough to recover from a PR marathon and have fun at your first 50, but I don't know you, and I don't know how fast you'll recover or what kind of mileage you have in your legs already.  Since this is your first ultra, and you stacked races together like this, I'm guessing that you don't have a ton of miles in your legs, you will be smoked from a PR marathon and will not be stoked during the back end of the 50.  With all that being said, you asked for help so... I'd train for the 50 (probably 30 mile long run over similar terrain to the 50 miler as your longest), but add your marathon speed/tempo workouts into the mix during the week.  Top out with at least a 60 mile week, but preferrably 70 or 80 if your body can hang.  The guys running 5.5 hour 50s are running 2:20 marathons, so the disciplines are related, at least at the elite level, and it's possible to train for both at the same time.  Like the other posters said, however...you probably shouldn't race the marathon for PR time and then run the 50...you'd be better off dropping to the 50k (if they have one) and shooting for a 50 miler later in the year or next year."

Keep distance short and intensity low, if you can, run on a stable and soft surface.  If you feel the bad kind of pain or soreness, err on the side of caution and take some more time off.  Its not rocket science, just be careful.  Take it one day at a time and build very slowly."
running,3e3mvc,HMJ87,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:26:25 2015 UTC,"Unless you're base training you should have days that you go hard and days that you go soft. This refers to pace and distance. Two hard workouts a week is usually what I try to do. Good work so far and don't get discouraged , a lot of times minor fluctuations are normal in any type of exercise."
running,3e3mha,bluejacket1989,2,Tue Jul 21 18:23:58 2015 UTC,"You are describing patellar tendonitis. Sounds like the lower insertion point into your patella is causing you some issues. Treating patellar tendonitis differs from person to person and there no way to to know which treatment path is best for you without getting you on an exam table and manipulating your legs. Go see an ortho and get a script for physical therapy. They will measure your range of motion and leg strength and give you a treatment plan.   In the meantime, ice after workouts, make sure you don't keep your knee past 90 degrees for prolonged lengths of time, and avoid having your knee bump into anything to ensure you keep inflammation down as much as possible.  In terms of supplements, I take Glucosamine, MSM, Chondroitin, and Fish oil to help keep pain and inflammation down."

Then I injured my knee doing squats in the gym and was left with that pain from just walking up the stairs in my house. Long story short, I went to see a physio therapist and she said that my hips are really weak and gave me exercises (mainly clams and one legged hip thrusts) to train them. After a couple of months I started running again and I haven't experienced any pain since then!"

To track my distance, pace, and splits accurately I need to use the FitBit app on my phone, which spits out real-time voice cues on these metrics. Having said that, you can get distance and pace using just the FitBit Charge HR, but it would be after you complete the work out and not in real time (and not as accurate). In order to get all of this information sans the mobile app + Charge HR, you would need the FitBit Surge. I haven't used a vivofit 2 so I can't comment on that. Hope this helps!"

running,3e3aaa,twosplits,2,Tue Jul 21 17:01:48 2015 UTC,"Generally speaking, ice and ibuprofen are only really effective treatment when applied to an acute injury to prevent excess swelling/compartment syndrome. Once the initial swelling had happened, you're going to want to let your body run it's course. NSAIDs like ibuprofen and Aleve do not speed recovery time (and there's some evidence recently that they may actually prolong it).  Very light exercise that works the target area is good, as it gets the blood flowing and prevents the build up of scartissue. Obviously, if it hurts, stop, but try to find something low impact like easy cycling or swimming, and transition into light jogging."

running,3e0ekn,VitruvianGirl,2,Tue Jul 21 13:24:32 2015 UTC,"Basically, imagine you knew the course inside-out and you were the only one running. When there was a left turn, you would move as far left as possible while staying inbounds and when there was a right turn, as far to the right. That makes the course as ""short""  as possible.   That is running the tangents of the curves.   Unfortunately, if there is any density of people in a race, it is impossible to do that. So every variation from the ""perfect"" line adds to your distance and adds up over the race. I've had really crowded races where my watch reads 13.5 miles and I've never had one read less than 13.25. You always end up running a little extra.   Hope that helps!"

running,3e1mfs,heidavey,4,Tue Jul 21 11:41:39 2015 UTC,"It's great training IMO.  I did a 35-miler with 3500ft ascent two weeks before a 40-miler with 7500ft ascent at the tail end of last and it was the best thing.  You, of course have to listen to your body and it depends on your pace and expectation from both the marathon and the ultra, but I think that 5 weeks is plenty of time for recovery and the marathon gives you the perfect opportunity to test a number of things regarding nutrition and gear.  Treat it as a training run."
running,3e1mfs,Rockzilla78,2,Tue Jul 21 09:34:54 2015 UTC,"Agreed, treat it like a training run and an opportunity to test out your gear and to get over some of your inevitable race day nerves. Focus on keeping a steady pace. If you're like me, you'll naturally want to go out fast with everyone else in the first couple of miles and wind up regretting it later on. Pay attention to your body and look for signs that you're over exerting, getting dehydrated or hungry and learn to be proactive about taking care of those problems before they get worse. Any problem you experience in a marathon will be amplified in an ultra.  I know you want a good time at your marathon, but if it's your first and your primary goal race is even longer and so soon afterwards you should really just aim to finish without wrecking yourself too badly.

Should be fine, I think, as long as you don't blow yourself up / injure yourself in the marathon or by trying to jumps on the train too fast after.  Take a day or two off after the marathon, and ease back in over the rest of the week, then you have 2.5 weeks of training, then 1.5 weeks to taper again. Easy-Peasy"

running,3e06up,banalrapist,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:33:19 2015 UTC,"this was a good article, but we each have to determine and consider our diets, how much calcium and other minerals we are getting.  sounds like very important aspects to bone conditioning. I am also sure age has a ton of influence on this as well.  I am glad to have read it, maybe I'll avoid some common mistakes. Thank you"
running,3e06up,banalrapist,5,Tue Jul 21 19:00:37 2015 UTC,"Probably. Most plans don't increase every week - they increase for few weeks then drop back a bit, then increase again.  But mileage change alone isn't the only possible reason. Running in the wrong/worn out shoes will eventually hit you at high enough mileage, as will issues with form."

running,3e2e53,evilbunny77,5,Tue Jul 21 12:55:43 2015 UTC,"The cushioning can affect your balance and power transfer because they absorb some of the force you're generating to lift the weight. It's also better to lift in something with a flat, flexible sole (squats may be different I guess), I don't know what the heel drop is on the shoes you mentioned though."
running,3e2e53,evilbunny77,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:05:09 2015 UTC,Would a lower heel drop be ok for lifting? Does any of this affect using the shoes for walking?
running,3e2e53,AnonymousWritings,3,Tue Jul 21 13:13:16 2015 UTC,"You really want your lifting shoes to be flat and have an un-cushioned sole, like chucks for example. Edit: I don't think it would affect walking negatively, just try it and see if you feel okay. But obviously using the shoes more will wear them out more - but that's expected."
running,3e2e53,maduste,0,Tue Jul 21 13:18:06 2015 UTC,"You really want your lifting shoes to be flat and have an un-cushioned sole   What companies make as intentional weightlifting shoes seems to disagree with that statement.  http://www.roguecanada.ca/shoes/weightlifting-shoes  0.75"" heel height (19mm) on one I clicked on at random.  Personally I use Mizuno Wave Rally court shoes for lifting, they have less spongy cushioning and a more stable platform, but I don't think they are flat.. I have tried regular running shoes a few times but they felt unstable."
running,3e2e53,evilbunny77,2,Tue Jul 21 14:05:20 2015 UTC,"Raised heel for Olympic lifts and squats. Flat shoes, or no shoes, for deadlifts.  The heel height of shoes is secondary when judging for lifting. The squishiness is the major drawback. Power is lost when the shoes compress. Not only are running shoes bad for lifting; lifting is bad for running shoes."

running,3e2e53,Despoena,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:10:08 2015 UTC,"Are they comfortable? Comfort and a shoe that fits well are probably the two most important factors. They will wear out faster the more you use them, but rotating them should extend the life of each pair a little."
running,3e2e53,MFoy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:53:51 2015 UTC,They are very comfortable. I googled their names and they all seem to be very expensive ($100+). I just don't want to 'damage' them by using them 'incorrectly'. I would assume that a shoe designed for running won't last as long when you use it for something else.
running,3dyoni,Vectorbug,7,Mon Jul 20 16:42:30 2015 UTC,"Additionally I did all of my running in a cycling kit. I have a special occasions kit by Twin Six I don't wear very often, but I thought this was a suitable event. Running in a cycling jersey was perfect because of the pockets on the back. I was able to carry my gps, phone, id/debit card and a water bottle without any of it bothering me and I can unzip the front.  For the most part it was really comfortable since its made for activity. However, the chamois in the crotch chafed something fierce in my bikini line. But I got a lot of compliments and overheard people referring to me as ""there goes yellow guy!"", so it was worth it.  Some other thoughts if you're searching for info before your first: - I highly recommend run commuting for training if you can do it. About the only time I run is to-from work about 5 miles each way with some elevation changes. However, the 3 weeks leading up to the event I didn't run at all because I was training for a 200 mile bike ride. Running twice a day is a nice way to get your body to HTFU - I see a lot of posts asking how people can deal with running in the morning because they're evening people, or asking how people can deal with running in the evening because they're morning people. I ride or run to work and back 80% of the time, so I'm just used to it.   Cycling is a great cross-training activity to build cardio endurance and I attribute this to my times (8 minute miles for my first two legs and 9 min for my final eight mile hilly ""very hard"" leg). But I do find my calves are a little sore now, post-race. After my first run my hips were pretty sore as was my right quad area and upper left shin. No damage, just sore from being weak. Minor blistering on my toes thanks to Balega socks (could have been worse). Don't worry about carb loading the night before. You're really only running 3-8 miles per leg. Think of this as an endurance event in the mental sense, not physical. 99% of the time you're waiting in the van. The less time I spend in a porto-potty the better. DO eat right after your first leg and snack through the day. I was mostly fueled by 3-4 maple and chocolate donuts for breakfast and water before my first leg (Leg 2). For lunch I stopped and got a Big Bite Hotdog and Slurpee at 7-11 but thats because I know my body won't flip out by this and I had several hours to my next run. I snacked lightly. Others in my team plowed through starburst, twizzlers and other candy. I tried not to eat for at least an hour before my runs. I stuck to my donuts, bananas and water along with the 7-11 lunch. I honestly don't remember what the hell I had for dinner. Pack light. Bring a fresh pair of socks for each leg of your race. I also brought extra shoes but I didn't need to. I only wore one outfit/costume for my runs, but I brought extra (legit running shorts and singlet). I only brought one regular outfit (shirt, undies, shorts), I wish I had brought extra undies and shirts. Sleeping supplies. Bring a pillow, thick blanket or sleeping bag and ear plugs. I meant to bring a sleeping bag and had an opportunity to sleep outside for a few hours but only had a shitty blanket and no pillow. I fell asleep for a few minutes but was repeatedly woken up by the announcer at the spot we parked at and random people using outside voices with their teams (duh). Sleeping in the van was nearly impossible due to the course having so many turns and stops - it's a lot easier to sleep during freeway mileage. Compression socks. My feet get swollen during travel anyway, so it was really nice to slip this on during ""transfers"". Everyone is your friend! It's a race but lets be honest, only about 4 teams are going to take it that seriously. Don't put the ragnar fake tattoo on your neck if you think you're being original. Thats where everyone puts it. DONT LOCK THE KEYS IN THE VAN. The van next to us at the start line did exactly this. =("

It was my (and my team's) first time doing Ragnar and I had that Deception Pass leg around 4AM. We were short runners as well on our team so our van (2) ran all the extra legs.

We had 2 instances with our car going to the wrong place and the runner having to wait. That probably added about 30 minutes and dropped our place by 20 spots.   We also had issues finding people so we ran it with 10.

Last October at the Rock ’n’ Roll Denver Half Marathon, he thought the race started at 8 a.m. instead of 7:15 a.m. He realized the mistake once he saw the rest of the runners gathering around.

running,3e1egi,Beefer_sutherland,4,Tue Jul 21 05:25:18 2015 UTC,"You really aren't doing any ""damage"" by crossing into your anaerobic zone. All this means is that your body is consuming primarily sugars for fuel, vs. fat for fuel when you're in your aerobic zone.  So you may run out of energy sooner until you get used to running.  While  you're building your fitness you may very well find that you cannot run without the heart rate climbing past that threshold. Don't worry about it!  Your Aerobic system will still develop just fine, as long as you keep training.  A low-tech test for you to tell if  you're running too fast is to simply carry on a conversation. If you can't get out a sentence without huffing and puffing between words, then slow it down."
running,3e1egi,iplaybass72,3,Tue Jul 21 05:51:22 2015 UTC,"Take the heart rate monitor back, you don't need to worry about lactate thresholds and VDOTs and whatever right now. Don't read so much and just run. Listen to your body, it'll tell you when to slow down and when to push it."
running,3e1egi,Rockzilla78,2,Tue Jul 21 05:40:28 2015 UTC,"If you want to run based on your heart rate, you will need to measure your actual maximum heart rate. Using a formula is like assuming your shoe size based on the average of the population. It's the heart rate strap, not the watch that will be causing issues. It is totally common for the readings of the first 15 minutes to be wonky. Moisten the measurement part of the belt before putting it on, that usually helps. Don't worry too much about what zone you are running in. As long as you don't go all out, you'll be fine. Running in the right zone is more about optimising your training than anything else."

I love gadgets and tracking and planning too - but in order to manage your expectations and stay motivated, you have to start very basic.  I had no idea what my pace per mile even was until I finished C25K and I highly recommend others take the same approach."
running,3e1egi,AptCasaNova,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:04:19 2015 UTC,"At the point you're at now, I wouldn't worry about trying to match your heart rate to a specific range. Some folks here are saying that you shouldn't be using a HRM at all yet, but I disagree. I think that it's a handy tool to use in order to track your progress, but I agree that using it to actually adjust your running during your runs isn't something you should worry about yet.   I've just gotten back into running after a several year hiatus and I'm unable to run and keep my heart rate below 80% of my max. I'm not going to start running super super slow in order to attempt to get my heart rate that low, but what I am doing is using the HRM to record statistics about myself so that I can see my progress as the weeks go by. That's my recommendation for now."
running,3e1egi,brandon7s,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:38:14 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't worry too much about your heart rate at this point, although I do agree that it's useful for tracking and optimizing weight loss. On top of a heart rate monitor, I would look into calorie tracker apps and a good running app (I hear Strava is popular, but I use Nike+).  Secondly, I would look into a good C25K program, like the others have recommended. However, I'm going to add that doing interval-style training would ease you into running longer distances without pushing yourself so hard that you hate it and/or injure yourself. Try walking for 1 minute, then running/jogging at a hard-ish pace for 2 minutes for a couple miles and see how you feel!  Lastly, it's normal to seeHRs well above the ""expected"" rates as a beginner because your body's not used to it! After a couple weeks of regular training, you should see something a bit less alarming.  I'd love to hear more about your runs in the future!"

No problems whatsoever. For the last week I've woken up extremely drowsy for some reason. Anyone have this issue? Naps during the day have been nice but haven't helped the morning drowsiness. In training for a race that will occur during the day, should I be training to run in the heat? The majority of my running happens before the sun comes up. Hunger pangs- been getting these mid-way or towards end of runs- I generally go on an empty stomach- do ya'll recommend those gatorade gel things beforehand?"
running,3dxq9a,sloworfast,8,Mon Jul 20 13:44:52 2015 UTC,"You're drowsy because 5 am is too damn early! Ok, just kidding, maybe you need a bit more sleep now that you're training consistently. Or a wake-up light alarm clock. You should try to train at least a few times at ""race time"" o'clock and ideally in race weather conditions, though obviously that's harder to predict. Your body gets used to running at a certain time of day or in certain conditions if you always do the same thing.  Depends how far you're going and how you feel. If you're hungry for like 2 km at the end, then it's probably not a big deal. If you're feeling weak or low on energy, then definitely eat something before. A gel is pretty easy on the stomach, though it might take you a few runs to get used to it, so if you get a cramp the first time, don't despair! Sometimes I eat a few crackers before a morning workout. (On the rare occasion that I do a morning workout...)"

If you are, the drowsiness may be caused by interrupting your REM sleep. Changing when you go to bed may help, such as a bit earlier (or even later if you're still getting enough sleep), or using an app that records your movement while sleeping and then extrapolates your REM cycles based on movement, waking you during you're lightest sleep period around your alarm time."

running,3dxq9a,ForwardBound,4,Mon Jul 20 13:42:51 2015 UTC,"Yes, that seems pretty standard. A lot of guys I know even choose to run 5ks 7 days out from their marathons. Something like 3 x mile will, as /u/incster says, actually give you a benefit on race day, is far enough away from the marathon to let you recover, and I also think that it's close enough to the marathon that it will let MP feel easier on the day."
running,3dxq9a,kinsibit,4,Mon Jul 20 12:58:56 2015 UTC,"I definitely agree with that.   So really, mile repeats are for endurance purposes, while anything less are more towards developing speed/vo2."
running,3dxq9a,ForwardBound,3,Mon Jul 20 13:16:24 2015 UTC,I think I would draw a line between 5k pace and anything quicker. I'd be afraid that marathon-level mileage combined with anything at repeat pace would put me at risk for injury.
running,3dxq9a,kinsibit,4,Mon Jul 20 13:33:24 2015 UTC,"I've been doing a few sessions of 600s, 800s, 1k and 1200m repeats prior to this at sub 5k pace. I'm a bit more inclined to slow it down a touch for the mile repeats though.   I like the idea of doing 400ms at repeat pace at some point in the future. But I've typically had a preference towards tempo runs and other endurance based runs."

I guess I am specifically referring to the recent HM race report on the front page.  Am I just running way too slow? 1:23 HM PB, 1:56 30K PB, 17:30 5K PB, but I still typically run easy/daily runs at 5:00-5:30/km pace (8:00-8:50/mile), and if I am not paying attention my pace drifts off to 6:00/km."
running,3dxq9a,craigster38,9,Mon Jul 20 13:34:18 2015 UTC,"I'm in your boat as well.  I base my runs off of HR. Anything under 150bpm, I consider an easy effort. Generally, 130-135 feels comfortable, and that's around 930-10/mile. If I start pushing to 140-150, it's still easy, but slightly more uncomfortable. When I push to 140-150, I'm in the range of what the VDOT calculators say I should be - otherwise I'm too slow."
running,3dxq9a,AnonymousWritings,4,Mon Jul 20 13:38:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah... I haven't worn a HRM for a while, but when I was my runs were in the realm of 128-135bpm.  I think I do have a pretty low max heart rate though, it seems like it is somewhere between 185 and high 180's for a 23M, 10bpm or so lower than normal."
running,3dxq9a,kinsibit,3,Mon Jul 20 13:41:02 2015 UTC,Sounds like you need to focus on running your easy runs slightly faster then? I tend to run most of mine between 4:50 and 5:05/km while my recovery runs are between 5:20 and 5:30/km.   For comparison: I have a 19:40 5K (and believe I could run a 19:10) while I have a 40:37 10K.   According to VDOT you definitely would be in the recovery range for most of your runs.
running,3dxq9a,dafrk3in,3,Mon Jul 20 13:59:40 2015 UTC,"This might be relevant: http://www.angio.net/personal/run/hadd.pdf  The outline, if you're training primarily for long distances, is:  1: Find your max HR  2: Spend most of your time running at about 50 bpm below your max HR.  3: Spend some time pushing your lactate threshold, starting with training runs at about 40 bpm below your max HR, increasing it as you progress."
running,3dxq9a,landrybennett,2,Mon Jul 20 14:39:47 2015 UTC,"I think it depends on how far you're running as well. When I started as a young teenager, my brother ran his runs at 7:00ish/mi, and I killed myself trying to keep up with him. But as I rounded into shape, I was able to sustain that pace for longer and longer. Since then, it's sort of just been my reference pace but I've never really done what I would consider high mileage either. I follow some pros on Strava who regularly run centuries and they may average 7:30/mi on an easy day, but they're sometimes running twice the total mileage that I am."

I know the Seattle marathon is November 29th, but I'm just not sure what my goals should be now or if I want to do that race.

Right now, my long term goal is to go sub-1:30 in the half marathon. I know that'll take me at least another year or two to achieve, but it gives me something to always work towards. My short term goals are for all of my upcoming races; sub-43 10k in August, Sub-1:35 HM in October, Sub-20 5k in October.  You have a bazillion different ways you could take your training. You could train for speed, for endurance, for short races, for long races, for a combination of everything! You just have to decide what you want to do."
running,3dxq9a,myminisnameistwiggy,4,Mon Jul 20 16:58:01 2015 UTC,"Awesome, thanks for the suggestion. I guess I'm just having trouble narrowing down what I would like to do. I feel it's sacrilege to say I don't want to do really long distances but I also feel I should try and do something really difficult like that before I move my goals to speed in shorter distances and all, if that makes sense. Maybe I'll just spend this week looking at races around here until the end of the year and try and make a decision by Friday?   Thanks again for the ideas - this gives me a good place to start. Cheers"
running,3dxq9a,craigster38,4,Mon Jul 20 17:07:46 2015 UTC,"The runners handbook doesn't say you have to do long distance at some point. Do whatever you want. If you want to work on speed, work on speed.  I did the natural progression - 5k < 10k < HM < Full. After my HM, I went right into marathon training, and dreaded it by the end. I'm just not a full marathon kind of guy. So now I am working on my speed, and it's doubtful if I'll ever run more than 13.1 miles."
running,3dxq9a,myminisnameistwiggy,3,Mon Jul 20 17:12:01 2015 UTC,"That's true. When I ran XC and track, I was always around that 2-mile or 5k distance and it felt good. But I've been focusing on distance these last few years and am not sure if I want to continue this or do some other distance.   Honestly I just don't enjoy running a marathon. I ran 34 miles split up into a few runs for Ragnar, so that was more fun for me because it wasn't as monotonous as one long run. I like the half marathon distance a lot but I think I could improve my 5k speed a lot. I should make a list of races I think would be fun by the end of the year and see which line up with goals I think I should focus on. Thanks again for your suggestions!"

I'm looking at races from now until the end of the year and trying to decide what would be fun for me to sign up for and what lines up with the kinds of goals I think I would like?

running,3dxq9a,myminisnameistwiggy,3,Mon Jul 20 17:31:14 2015 UTC,That's a good way of looking at it. I'm looking at some 5Ks and 10Ks that sound fun and some trail races.

running,3dxq9a,kkruns,3,Mon Jul 20 17:41:03 2015 UTC,"Focusing on the 5K could be great. It's a nice change in training from long-distance focused plans, and it is really satisfying to put in some really solid short distance times. Also, beating your HS self is always a fantastic feeling! As an added bonus, that short distance focus can really help with later efforts for longer-distance PRs."
running,3dxq9a,myminisnameistwiggy,3,Mon Jul 20 17:37:00 2015 UTC,That's what I'm thinking - it's hard to stay motivated when you feel like you do the exact same long runs all the time. I think I'm gonna sign up for a 5K this weekend nearby. Who knows how that'll go but I think it'll be a fun adjustment from running long ass miles all the time. Thanks for your advice!

I started adding classes three times a week to my routine and now I go four to five times a week. I couldn't be more happy adding it to my running.   Results over time? No more runner's knee because of the lifting and squats and workouts focusing on legs. The other thing is I no longer have low back pain when running because a lot of the workouts focus on strengthening your back. Lots of runners tend to hunch over when running and that strains your back and shoulders. I think the biggest improvement in athletic performance is I've strengthened the muscles around my knees a lot more than if I just ran. I've always had bad knees from a fracture many years ago, so the lifting I do definitely helps with that.   I don't know if this was helpful or not.

running,3dxq9a,PepperoniFire,2,Mon Jul 20 22:17:31 2015 UTC,"I've had this lingering knee pain.  If I use an internet checklist, it seems like ITBS.  I took two days off last time this happened and it felt better.  It's nothing massive pain-wise but if I run 'too much' then it can really hurt to the point where it's prudent to stop.  I'm probably going to take a week off to RICE.  I could use the reset anyway, even if it will make me cranky.  I just don't know if I want to do it this week, when I'm forty miles away from meeting my monthly mileage goal, or the first week of August, when it would be nice to start fresh.  It's frustrating because sometimes I try to plan for this the night before the week starts and then after walking around the next day, everything feels a little better.  I also feel like I can run a lot more miles per week but for this relatively new limitation.  I'm leaning towards letting this week be and starting August fresh since I have a fake half marathon in September.  This started at about the same time my Newtons hit 300 miles.  I'm honestly a bit disappointed with how quickly I ran through those even though I liked them well enough while they lasted.  I also had some popliteus tendon issues flare up for the first time ever so I've effectively retired those and the problem has mostly gone away.  I'm hoping the rest + new shoe rotation will alleviate this problem.  Uh, what would you do?  And should I continue foam rolling during this break or let everything chill out?"

Most people could probably jog or walk a mile, but many can't fathom doing 26.2 miles at any pace. So the marathon always sounds more impressive. Speed or time doesn't come into it.  As an example, if I tell someone I ran a 3:15 marathon, they have no clue if that's any good. I have to give them context - like the average LA Marathon finishing time was around 5:30, and my time puts me in the top 10% of my age group. So, pretty good, but not elite.  On the other hand, if I only told them the world record is just under 2:03, my time would sound really slow.  But the distance always impresses."

running,3dxq9a,ViridianHominid,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:55:22 2015 UTC,"My question is this: How much running is too much for a beginner? I'm mostly concerned about if there's potential for bone injury- how much impact is too much? I read that it takes a long time for your bones to strengthen in response to exercise.  I've jumped into running in the past few weeks and I've found that for me it was much easier to get into than training regimes like C25K have laid out. I did a 3 or 4 runs here and there a little more than a month ago, and then two weeks ago I started jogging a 5k every day, and my times are usually a bit over a half an hour. Twice I pushed myself a little further and went 7.5k. Is it safe for a beginning runner to go 20-25 miles per week? Should I be limiting my run length or cumulative weekly length until I've been running for a few months? I really, really don't want to develop a stress fracture out of my enthusiasm for running, and I do not have a metric for what's ""ok"" for my body to handle besides pain, and I am not having much of that. (Bit of stomach cramping, some sore muscles, but nothing that didn't feel better with a walking break or by the next day.) I'm ~30 M for reference."
running,3dxq9a,philipwhiuk,2,Mon Jul 20 21:10:46 2015 UTC,"Be careful about upping your weekly mileage. Given you don't really have much of a baseline for what is injury causing at this stage, if you feel anything significant the next day then don't increase your mileage that week.  I would also say that you should still take at least one rest day a week.  People do run every day and maintain long streaks. But I suspect they lose quality in response. In addition many of them started young and so have had time to adapt. When taking it up as an older person your body is less forgiving to the change.  With all that said, C25K is designed as a slow progression safe routine for people who are unfit. If you were not unfit then I would say it is rather slow to progress. Many people will have the first few weeks or more in baseline fitness I think.  It also works somewhat towards the bucket goal ideology of doing races slowly but getting round. It works towards completing longer and longer distances without really saying ""let's step back and get quicker rather than just going further and further""."
