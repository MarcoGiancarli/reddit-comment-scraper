swtor,3e38nn,SithLordMilk,-21,Tue Jul 21 20:11:46 2015 UTC,^ Greatest internet post of all times.
swtor,3e38nn,GreenArrow76,9,Tue Jul 21 18:55:21 2015 UTC,"Nice, I just bough this the other day after feeling like replaying it all, just in time for this update!"
swtor,3e38nn,Tyrexx_Lannister,9,Tue Jul 21 16:55:05 2015 UTC,This is great! Now I just hope that they provide this for KOTOR 1 as well.
swtor,3e38nn,DionysusDerp,5,Tue Jul 21 17:50:59 2015 UTC,"kotor 1 is actually pretty stable with HD mods, 2 was always the problem child ;)"
swtor,3e38nn,boredbritgamer,3,Tue Jul 21 19:20:55 2015 UTC,"1 Is non-functional for me actually. All my original saves mysteriously broke, I get missing textures all the time, the game stutters, and a wide range of other technical issues from voices being missing in cutscenes to triggers not occurring properly."
swtor,3e38nn,forumrabbit,7,Tue Jul 21 20:28:35 2015 UTC,"Native widescreen resolution support   Honestly, this is the biggest thing for me. Been putting off playing through both KOTOR games because it can be a hassle to get widescreen set up. Anyone know if the first KOTOR has native widescreen support? If so this'd be the best day ever."
swtor,3e38nn,EcoleBuissonniere,2,Tue Jul 21 19:07:11 2015 UTC,"Not natively but the mods to make it happen are pretty stable with it. Kotor 2 has always had issues with it.  I did a full playthrough on twitch the other month fine at widescreen, the only downside being the stream couldn't see video cutscenes although I could but for just a single player, that's all you need."
swtor,3e38nn,boredbritgamer,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:23:10 2015 UTC,"I know that it works, it's just annoying to get set up, haha. Woulda been nice to have, but it's not nearly as necessary for it as it is for KOTOR 2, and I prefer the second game anyway, so I'm still happy."
swtor,3e38nn,EcoleBuissonniere,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:26:05 2015 UTC,"So very few have that opinion - liking KotOR 2 more than the first one. I once got into argument with my entire guild about that! It is much better indeed, much more grimmy and mature."
swtor,3e38nn,bmatys,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:06:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's a lot like Fallout New Vegas, where the majority of people prefer its predecessor, but a vocal minority considers the Obsidian game better for being better-written and more unique."

swtor,3e38nn,bearerofbearnews,2,Tue Jul 21 17:27:52 2015 UTC,TSLRCM has been updated and added to the Steam workshop to coincide with this pdate.
swtor,3e38nn,Vriff205,2,Tue Jul 21 17:46:53 2015 UTC,"The kick in the pants is that I JUST started a new game a day or two ago, and I'm basically almost done. Which means all those blank achievements will just sit their mocking me for awhile."

swtor,3e38nn,frozenfade,2,Tue Jul 21 18:12:58 2015 UTC,...WHAT  this is great news.  Native controller support?   Someone please tell me this has been patched for KOTOR I!
swtor,3e38nn,Celoth,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:11:59 2015 UTC,"NOPE! This is specifically for kotor 2. Tbh the first game takes mods quite happily, 2 has always been a bugger because of how it was made. Much more of a useful update for it :)"
swtor,3e38nn,boredbritgamer,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:24:12 2015 UTC,My problem with both these games on PC is that they were fairly unplayable with a controller.  Glad to see at least one is adding controller support in.
swtor,3e38nn,Celoth,2,Tue Jul 21 19:26:13 2015 UTC,Is this only for the Steam version? Or can other versions such as retail and GOG get the native widescreen support?
swtor,3e38nn,GarrioValere,4,Tue Jul 21 21:02:08 2015 UTC,"this is nice, but honestly I wonder why they would do any of this? Not that I'm complaining."

swtor,3e38nn,bstr413,2,Tue Jul 21 17:55:09 2015 UTC,KOTOR I has been available to Linux and Mac for a while now.  KOTOR II was only available for Windows until now. Disney Interactive and LucasArts decided to port it to the other OS's and provide native support for mods like the necessary TSLRCM mod. I guess Steam decided to throw in a few achievements too.  EDIT: They hired help from Aspyr to help with the port.
swtor,3e38nn,Fredvdp,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:35:32 2015 UTC,Disney Interactive and LucasArts decided to port it   I read on another subreddit that Aspyr did the port. LucasArts doesn't exist anymore.
swtor,3e38nn,bstr413,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:27:07 2015 UTC,"Aspyr helped with the port too:   Aspyr in partnership with Disney Interactive and LucasArts is proud to announce STAR WARS™ Knights of the Old Republic™ II - The Sith Lords™ is now available on Mac and LInux   LucasArts is still around. They just won't develop games separately anymore: it has to be in conjunction with another studio, like Disney Interactive or Aspyr."
swtor,3e38nn,Qunra_,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:30:15 2015 UTC,"Isn't LucasArts just for licensing purposes? As in it doesn't employ anyone, Disney just uses the name?  Anyways, I'm fairly certain that sentence just means Aspyr did all the work, and Disney just signed the deal and got it published.  edit: oh, it's Disney Interactive... they actually do develop games. Sorry missed the ""interactive""-part."
swtor,3e38nn,Darth_Kyofu,-2,Tue Jul 21 20:07:14 2015 UTC,KOTOR III confirmed

swtor,3e2mr7,AderynDawn,11,Tue Jul 21 14:08:27 2015 UTC,"So, this is basically a calculator?"
swtor,3e2mr7,fatfatninja,8,Tue Jul 21 14:42:07 2015 UTC,Yes.   It's just that the inputs are easier and the calculations happen automatically on all parts. (Fill in one part and it calculates the others such as credits received and profit made automatically).
swtor,3e2mr7,mekabar,4,Tue Jul 21 14:44:54 2015 UTC,I'm not sure if I get what this is supposed to accomplish. Is it basically the same as tracking every sale in a spreadsheet?
swtor,3e2mr7,feor1300,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:51:38 2015 UTC,"Sounds like it , except that you don't have to know how to manipulate a spreadsheet to use it."
swtor,3e2mr7,swtorista,4,Tue Jul 21 18:20:26 2015 UTC,"with only 1 app developer on our team     It's a pretty simple application, though it looks kinda handy for someone who GTNs and isn't interested in setting up a basic spreadsheet. I see you are a 3-person team - what did the rest of the team work on, who isn't the developer?"
swtor,3e2mr7,swtorista,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:47:46 2015 UTC,"It is definitely just meant to make things a lot easier, with a quick access app on your phone that does the calculations for you.   The developer did pretty much all of the work on the GTN app here. I helped with some logic of the calculations, layout, and some general planning. Together we came up with the app for personal use, but then decided to share it and release it for download.  We're currently working on multiple projects. Kyle, our creative director, is working on the story and mechanics of a full-fledged RPG.   I am overseeing development processes and marketing (hence the post here by me). I am also working on the story and art of a few games we have in the planning, next to finishing up my last year of university.  We really need a way to port apps to iOS, as I know there's a big demand on that platform (I'm an iPhone user myself), so we're also actively working on that. We just don't have a budget to speak of, haha."
swtor,3e2mr7,thc1967,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:59:14 2015 UTC,Thanks for sharing. I saw you guys were started in 2013 and was curious what else you were up to too. Good luck learning how to port :)
swtor,3e2mr7,Emeraldon,2,Tue Jul 21 15:12:17 2015 UTC,"wheezes Back in my day, we called these ""spreadsheets"". Now git off my lawn whilst I affix this here onion to my belt!"
swtor,3e2mr7,Emeraldon,3,Tue Jul 21 16:35:39 2015 UTC,Impressive. How do you gather the information from the game / servers?
swtor,3e2mr7,DorkJedi,4,Tue Jul 21 14:32:56 2015 UTC,"We don't, this is purely a calculator app making it easier to quickly calculate prices and profits. Unfortunately SWTOR doesn't allow that kind of information to be pulled and used (yet?)."
swtor,3e2mr7,vishnuk1,2,Tue Jul 21 14:36:16 2015 UTC,"Ah yeah, that I know. I misunderstood what the app was for.  Nevertheless, thanks a lot :)"
swtor,3e2mr7,leventc,2,Tue Jul 21 14:38:16 2015 UTC,"I was about to get excited about this, until I saw this.   I don't play the GTN, but I would like an easier way to judge trends so I know when I do sell I am in the ballpark. I know why no Auctioneer for SWTOR exists, I was just hoping you had found a way. It looks useful to those who do play the market, just not appealing to the 'average' user."
swtor,3e2mr7,Varnia,2,Tue Jul 21 16:44:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm the same. It would be excellent to follow trends on the GTN - or even to be able to check the price of something when you're not logged into the game."
swtor,3e2mr7,Darthtotalevil,2,Tue Jul 21 16:51:19 2015 UTC,"Amazing! Thank You so much! I truly appreciate the effort and help you put into making this app, thank you so much!"

swtor,3e3ah5,Lumberj,9,Tue Jul 21 17:12:25 2015 UTC,Huge respect for them after they decided to delay it though. There's always a great weight on dev shoulders to meet deadlines. Typically a studio keeps nearly everyone on call all the time and they work more hours than most of care to even think about. I can only imagine the time being poured into fixing whatever went wrong last minute.
swtor,3e3ah5,Nushens,2,Tue Jul 21 18:04:32 2015 UTC,"I was really disappointed that Yavin and Togruta didn't drop today, but I do appreciate that they're holding it back rather than releasing something half-assed or that'll get us stuck in the floor or our characters heads' fall or or something."
swtor,3e3ah5,flameofmiztli,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:21:21 2015 UTC,"Likely alone on this one, but had I my Desktop working OK, I'd be all over the Yavin 4 stronghold. Oh well, patience is a virtue."
swtor,3e3ah5,Darth_Wicked,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:18:09 2015 UTC,I've saved up a bunch of credits for it.  Only spending coins on the new packs since some of the mounts look cool.
swtor,3e3ah5,Lumberj,2,Tue Jul 21 17:21:14 2015 UTC,You should really consider buying the base unlock for cartel coins if you think you'll ever deactivate it because you have to pay the credits again to reopen it if you unlock with credits.
swtor,3e3ah5,willscy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:27:37 2015 UTC,Just sold the Monocycle for 5 million and the jet pack for 9 million

I'd love one of those Monocycles, but there's no way in hell I'd pay 5 million credits for it.  But, hey...to each their own, I guess."

swtor,3e3ah5,Saiaxs,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:49:41 2015 UTC,"Oh, I understand that completely.  And I guess it makes more sense to build up a stash of credits for that rather than blow real money away on RNG packs for a chance at a rare mount."
swtor,3e3ah5,Shatterhand1701,2,Tue Jul 21 19:55:35 2015 UTC,"I was mostly buying packs for the crystals or armor to put in my collection, just finished Zayne Carrick's armor set. The mounts were just profit for me"

swtor,3e3ah5,swtorista,2,Tue Jul 21 19:08:49 2015 UTC,somthing to note swtorista is that the clone wars is not in order some episode take place right after each other but are seasons apart for god only knows what reason. but do give it a try it picks up in season 3 and is 5x better then episodes 1-3 i swear by that
swtor,3e3ah5,Weibeifong,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:14:02 2015 UTC,"The reason for that is they went back and decided to flesh out those characters more with a backstory years later. They also for some reason made the movie happen after a few episodes of season 1, which is pretty jarring if you watch it in release order, because all of a sudden where's Ahsoka?"
swtor,3e3ah5,willscy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:25:57 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I'd read that they weren't in order but it was still confusing! Thanks for confirming it. I didn't even know there was 5 seasons haha, I'll try and stick with it until I get to 3 and see from there :) Does Ahsoka come back a lot? I like her character and her snarky relationship with Anakin."
swtor,3e3ah5,swtorista,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:27:52 2015 UTC,"Yes, she has a few arcs to herself as well. She became my fave so fast.

swtor,3e3ah5,SegfaultDefault,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:45:15 2015 UTC,Someone should probably inform the marketing intern who runs the SWTOR Twitter that the patch was delayed. /s
swtor,3e3ah5,Guyote_,-5,Tue Jul 21 19:00:00 2015 UTC,Any update on the delay? Or is BW still just not communicating and showing pics instead?

Bug fixes take time. And we don't know exactly which bugs they are trying to fix.  Why continue to say it's terrible communications, when they are telling us they haven't solved the issue yet but were working on it. That IS communicating with us.

swtor,3e3ah5,Guyote_,6,Tue Jul 21 18:08:20 2015 UTC,That's definitely NOT what that update said. Go back and read it.  It said they're testing it. Which means they made their fixes and are checking to make sure they work and aren't breaking anything else.  What would you say qualifies as an update?  That it's fixed and ready to go?

Priceless.  So...--okay. Look I'm happy...that's great... really... now I can go back to all 40+ companions and redo all their gear because I no longer have the dyelessness restriction removed... except I've completed all companion interactions and all of the current story in the game accross all classes.  Great... :,D.  I just hope that when FotFE rolls out and they revamp the companions they don't remove their gear or...you know.. kill them.  Lol god, I'm so mad and happy at the same time.  Edit Also... companions and dyes now appear correctly... but what about match to chest and hide head slot? Am I (I mean... not me because I won't get to see them in the cotscenes anymore but) going to see my companions chest with the proper dye color but the rest not matched?"
swtor,3e40mt,swtorista,2,Tue Jul 21 20:25:59 2015 UTC,"Don't get so excited.  Most cutscenes will stick fuck up your and their head slots, or show your companions in their original gear instead of what they have equipped, etc. etc."

swtor,3e40mt,Tyrexx_Lannister,3,Tue Jul 21 20:26:43 2015 UTC,I have no idea what's going on. People are more excited for Togruta than Cathar but they did so very little in the way of hyping them. Two twitter pics and a mention in interviews/cantina tours here and there.
swtor,3e40mt,bmatys,3,Tue Jul 21 20:41:26 2015 UTC,"Yea, the coming months before Cathar I can barely even recall a single person hyping, or even being that excited about them at all. But with Togruta, everybody is going mad over them, and they've done nothing.  Or, that could even be the reason... Not many people were hyped over the concept of Cathar, so they made a video to try and promote it and hype it up a bit before it came out, so more people would buy it.   But with Togruta, everyone is already hyped enough, so there's little need to make a trailer to get people hyped, guess it would just be a waste of resources/time in BW's eyes..."

swtor,3e40mt,bstr413,3,Tue Jul 21 20:44:17 2015 UTC,"The old Consumption ostensibly consumed some of your health to replenish your Force.  However, it was rarely needed because Lightning spec never runs out of Force and healers aren't often required to run full-throttle for long enough periods to require Consumption.  Furthermore, with the 4pc set bonus, Consumption no longer even consumed health when used properly.  In other words, the entire mechanic was largely ignored by class design.  The class is intended to require long-term energy management instead of the short-term management designs of the other classes.  Instead, it effectively had no management and had to be balanced down as a result.  The old mechanic wasn't bad, but it wasn't relevant either.  By re-working the Consumption mechanic somewhat, and by increasing Force costs, they were able to force healers back into a proper energy management scheme while balancing healing numbers up to where they should have been in the first place.  Their terminology was ""a more dynamic playstyle"", which is probably a good way to put it.  Sorcerer healing has often been described as ""boring"" since 3.0 because of the complete lack of meaningful Force management.  My testing on the PTS did not include Operations (can never find a large enough group) but the testing I did was favorable.  EDIT:  Only now, after posting, did I realize you were asking ""what"" instead of ""why"".  Sorry for not actually answering your question the first time.  Changing the name of the ability is a little deceptive because it's not a fundamentally different mechanic.  The precise mechanics and amounts are, of course, in the patch notes.  Functionally, the new mechanic rewards good behavior more and punishes poor behavior less, in exchange for demanding much more frequent use of the ability.  Good behavior - using Consuming Darkness occasionally, and with a stack of Force Surge - now results in a much larger total Force gain than before.  Poor behavior - using Consuming Darkness repeatedly and without a stack of Force Surge - no longer results in any health loss, but still results in much less net Force gain."
swtor,3e40mt,bstr413,2,Tue Jul 21 21:04:19 2015 UTC,They don't explain what exactly consuming darkness is in the patch notes. Is it an instant cast? Does it have a cd? Does it heal for anything?  I remember something about it being a two second cast that restores x amount of force. But its interesting they left that out of the patch notes.
swtor,3e40mt,DarthEwok42,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:51:34 2015 UTC,"Is it an instant cast? Does it have a cd? Does it heal for anything?   It is an instant cast with no CD and no healing or attacking.  Basically, it is the same as it is now on live but with less Force return and no health penalty. Your version mentioned was the original proposed changes, but some of them were reverted."
swtor,3e40mt,PM_ME_YOUR_CHESTHAMS,2,Tue Jul 21 20:57:29 2015 UTC,"The only difference is that it now does not cost health to use and returns slightly less Force as a result.  Basically, it now has the old 4-piece Healer Set baked in and the new 4-piece makes it return the same Force as before if used with Force Surge."

Now they have to have QA run through and make sure that nothing else broke during the new build.  How pissed off would people be if they didn't test it and released some other show stopping bug?

swtor,3dzmgs,perigon,2,Tue Jul 21 11:08:40 2015 UTC,"More the terrain & city design, think Ogrimmer, Undercity, Ironforge, Stormwind, the tree thing, etc.  Each was full of things to see and to use as a regular part of play. They had ships and zepplins and guards to hold off enemy players. It felt almost like a real place.  Bioware just haven't been good at making living locations since after Baldurs Gate. I'd say that they did pretty well with Taris in KotOR though, and maybe a few of the locations in Dragon Age Origins."
swtor,3dzmgs,AnOnlineHandle,2,Tue Jul 21 12:30:15 2015 UTC,I'd agree with you on the city thing there. They always felt more alive and I have a lot of fun memories from Stormwind.  I hope we get a better hub than the fleet when KOTFE comes out.

And the hate doesn't end with the orbital stations, either.  I can understand making me swing by the station for my inoculation before landing on Quesh - makes sense, right?  But after that first stop...  Maybe just let me land since I'm already inoculated.  Republic Belsavis makes sense to have an orbital station, it's a prison after all.  You want another layer of protection.  But the Empire is staging a prison break...  What the hell are they doing with a station in orbit?  And then my Sith Inquisitor goes and lands on Dromund Kaas...  And the hangar door is still closed.  I understand that going upstairs and looking out that window made for a dramatic scene when I first got my ship...  But I've been flying around in it for weeks, you think maybe you could open the door so I can just walk straight to the elevators?  Is it stuck or something?  Did somebody lose the keys?  It seems like the game engine doesn't have a whole lot of flexibility...  Like it straight-up cannot load different geometry or different areas based on your class/progress/whatever...  And maybe I'm just being unfair by comparing it to other/different MMOGs...  But it seems like some of this stuff shouldn't be written in stone.  Hell, for that matter, why does each class have its own docking bay?  Why do I need to remember which character I'm on and then double-check the map to see which hangar is where?  Why can't we all just run through the same doorway and be given a class-appropriate hangar instance?"
swtor,3dzmgs,Karfedix_of_Pain,6,Tue Jul 21 13:08:59 2015 UTC,KOTFE is a great chance to revamp the game. Not only story wise. But game wise too. Especially some of the out dated features which were outdated at launch still sitting there Yes i know people prefer content first and foremost.  But changing of a few systems. And ideas like the fleet revamp/removal are all needed.
swtor,3dzmgs,Darkatron,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:41:08 2015 UTC,"I don't think they can remove much as you still have option to do all from start, you don't need to start as outsider."

It is practical to have hubs being the same, and just a mirrored version of each other, but it should have been changed cause it is pretty lame.

swtor,3e2bza,illgot,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:23:06 2015 UTC,It's never exciting for me.  I dread all the crap taking up inventory space.  This is really why I hate opening rng boxes in any game.  All the crap I have to dump after.
swtor,3e2bza,AC_Boce,2,Tue Jul 21 19:07:46 2015 UTC,"I would only ever buy a hypercrate if all crates dropped 'tokens' that, even if you were ridiculously unlucky, you could still get 1-2 things you actually wanted from a vendor selling the packs' items."
swtor,3e2bza,ZerotheBlade,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:46:19 2015 UTC,So what's special about the infantry armor? I've been waiting for its release to see if I should get it or the Energized Infantry armor for my trooper.
swtor,3e2bza,Lagao,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:09:06 2015 UTC,"For me, I love the gloves. I have the galvanized infantry for my agent, and it looks awesome!"
swtor,3e2bza,MisterBlackJack,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:17:08 2015 UTC,The infantry armor gives off a visor holo effect everytime you activate your weapon.
swtor,3e2bza,collinch,3,Tue Jul 21 18:23:47 2015 UTC,"Sweet! It got released a bit earlier than 11, so things will start hitting gtn at a reasonable time tomorrow night."
swtor,3e2bza,Yavin_jc,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:46:58 2015 UTC,It was up at 710am EST. I picked up a pack before work and got some mando NPC
swtor,3e2bza,anakin_fede,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:48:01 2015 UTC,Cost? when arrive home i want to buy one
swtor,3e2bza,samuelelbongo,2,Tue Jul 21 12:49:35 2015 UTC,5400/250
swtor,3e2bza,BestFriendHasLeprosy,2,Tue Jul 21 12:54:37 2015 UTC,"5400 cartel coins, same as usual"
swtor,3e2bza,zakary3888,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:57:28 2015 UTC,For new ones isn't it usually only 15% off?
swtor,3e2bza,MisterBlackJack,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:31:40 2015 UTC,I believe 5400 is the 15% off.  Usually they are around 6900
swtor,3e2bza,zakary3888,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:25:21 2015 UTC,6900-5400=1500 1500/6900=.217  So I guess it is 20% off for new ones now? Maybe it's only the first week of release?
swtor,3e2bza,hepfestus,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:02:01 2015 UTC,"Got the hypercrate and got the decos I wanted and a few nice pieces. Mad I didn't get my simulator, though.   Also got the full Drifter set, which is what I really wanted...only to find out it clips horribly with the hair of the character I wanted it for, aghhh."
swtor,3e2bza,Healy2k,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:31:22 2015 UTC,Hair comes through the helmet? is this mostly for female hair?
swtor,3e2bza,hepfestus,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:15:04 2015 UTC,"Not through the helmet, the helmet covers everything like the helmets always do.   I don't use helmets though- so long female hair (and the long male hair I presume) cuts rightttt through the scarf and armor."
swtor,3e2bza,Healy2k,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:36:59 2015 UTC,Ah ok thats a bummer :/.  I only said helmet as the headhunter helmet had a hair glitch a while back where the female hair popped on the top lol.

swtor,3e2bza,Healy2k,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:35:51 2015 UTC,Is the drifter set easy to obtain? thats all im interested in :P
swtor,3e2bza,Healy2k,3,Tue Jul 21 14:43:41 2015 UTC,After 3 hypercrates I did not get a full set so maybe...
swtor,3e2bza,dusk22,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:54:33 2015 UTC,Thanks :-) I dont expect a full set just maybe 1-2 pieces missing
swtor,3e2bza,hepfestus,2,Tue Jul 21 15:03:41 2015 UTC,Drifter set comes in the bundle packs. 2 hypercrates and I only got the supplemental set.

swtor,3e2bza,cancelingchris,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:28:56 2015 UTC,That chest piece looks like a re-color of the supreme inquisitor one.
swtor,3e2bza,MisterBlackJack,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:37:40 2015 UTC,"it is. but i want the rest of the set that comes with it. the pants are nicer, etc."
swtor,3e2bza,cancelingchris,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:41:21 2015 UTC,I believe it comes in the last pack of this series since that one is more themed towards the sith

swtor,3e2bza,Lagao,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:51:17 2015 UTC,Any word on the rarity of stronghold decor (not the Sarlacc)?
swtor,3e2bza,ImNotASWFanboy,2,Tue Jul 21 15:53:27 2015 UTC,I got many mando pieces out of 1 hypercrate. Including the npcs.
swtor,3e2bza,daroamer,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:44:02 2015 UTC,"I think the only item I really want from this pack is the Darth Andeddu headgear. Might as well get a hypercrate anyway.

swtor,3e2bza,Windover,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:02:31 2015 UTC,"I bought a hypercrate and got the Whitefang out of it which is the one thing I really wanted so the rest is gravy.  Ended up with all the emotes and regens, a couple of full sets of armour with a third just missing the boots plus the Sorosubb and Czerka mounts.  A few of the decors as well but no sarlacc.  Quite happy with my haul."

swtor,3e3tqv,DarthSaro,4,Tue Jul 21 19:13:32 2015 UTC,"Prologue and Chapter 1-3 take about 3 years.

swtor,3e3tqv,pirox1234,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:08:33 2015 UTC,"Force users are rather young as it states in the storyline - all of them are considered very talented for their young age. Maybe except the inquisitor which was a slave so who knows when they decided to train him/her. Same goes for the agent which is coming straight from the academy. Trooper, smuggler and bounty hunter can be whatever you want them to be, my guess is early to mid 30s."
swtor,3e3tqv,bmatys,0,Tue Jul 21 21:14:59 2015 UTC,Age of the character is up to you - and your character's backstory.

swtor,3e0c53,darthjustin,2,Tue Jul 21 00:54:45 2015 UTC,"I would say Sage, guardian, commando and gunslinger. Same mirror for imp side ofcourse."
swtor,3e0c53,bonerjohnson,4,Tue Jul 21 09:17:14 2015 UTC,I'm close but the journey from 55to60 is so rough. That's where most are.
swtor,3e0c53,Queen_Dido,3,Tue Jul 21 09:48:16 2015 UTC,Yeah those solo flashpoints ger really boring after 8 times lol.
swtor,3e0c53,Queen_Dido,4,Tue Jul 21 09:58:31 2015 UTC,"Complete? Far from it, you still need to get one of each of the base classes to 60 without picking an advanced class."

swtor,3e0c53,p9504178,3,Tue Jul 21 00:29:36 2015 UTC,Awesome!!!  Quite a collection!   What's your favorite?
swtor,3e0c53,collinch,2,Tue Jul 21 05:46:59 2015 UTC,Oh its hard to pick a favorite. Mes'naldo was my 1st and is my main so he is in my top 3. Also Namrek was fun to play and I really liked the full dark side warrior story. Milner was an achivement for me since I played him using a DS4 and it's completly diffrent.
swtor,3e0c53,Dargarth,2,Tue Jul 21 09:21:13 2015 UTC,Mes'naldo...Milner....I see a pattern here.  Edit:  Di'Maria.  Yeah no pattern.  Nice to see a football fan on this sub.
swtor,3e0c53,KoruMatau,3,Tue Jul 21 14:25:49 2015 UTC,Someone is a fan of soccer/football. Mes'naldo= Messi Ronaldo  Di'Maria= Angel di Maria

swtor,3e0c53,AndrewMick,3,Tue Jul 21 09:10:56 2015 UTC,So what is the canonical ordering in which the 16 advanced classes must be arrayed for these screenshots? Because I worry about this. A lot.
swtor,3e0c53,DarthEwok42,2,Tue Jul 21 12:32:30 2015 UTC,Heh I don't know actually made an error at first and fixed the order so all the mirror classes are in line with each other. And put everyone on their capital planet.
swtor,3e0c53,Bheema_swtor,3,Tue Jul 21 13:06:18 2015 UTC,Pics of each toon? Do people still do that?
swtor,3e0c53,Appropriate-XBL,2,Tue Jul 21 12:40:49 2015 UTC,Yeah I can arrange that. Just thought it would be to much and people wouldn't be intrested. Are you thinking just headshots or ingame screenshots?
swtor,3e0c53,AmyBA,6,Tue Jul 21 13:09:39 2015 UTC,"This has been a work in progress for quite some time. The XP boost really helped my with my last couple of characters, since I have not been able to play much recently.   All of the classes are light and dark side variants. I really love the story in the game and have enjoyed playing it and will hopefully for a long time to come.   Also have a mix of races in there and have at least 1 level 60 of all races. (looking forward to Togruta to add to the collection.)  Edit: formatting."
swtor,3e0c53,Nerradda,3,Mon Jul 20 23:56:11 2015 UTC,"All of the classes are light and dark side variants.   Well now you need to play through all the stories one more time as a neutral. Sometimes choose light, other times choose dark. You can do it for the character that you don't choose an advanced class for as /u/Queen_Dido suggested."
swtor,3e0c53,harland45,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:52:29 2015 UTC,Haha nah it won't be any diffrent.

swtor,3e0c53,RickHalkyon,2,Tue Jul 21 01:14:10 2015 UTC,That's the first time I've seen the name Alayna aside from my girlfriend.
swtor,3e0c53,Instinct617,2,Tue Jul 21 04:22:56 2015 UTC,Well done.  I am jealous of your ability to get through that.  I'd burn out too quickly.

It should be said that playing a LS Sith does not make you a Jedi-Clone. You are rational, pragmatic and down to earth, much like Darth Marr appears to be.   You can threaten, sure, but you don't need to go full psycho mode."
swtor,3e2k7r,TheEgoRaptor,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:10:20 2015 UTC,Totally agree. I would venture to say the DS SW seems almost insane when it comes to his/her irrational choices to do violence.

You are rational, pragmatic and down to earth, much like Darth Marr appears to be.    Honestly, this is my problem with the alignment options in the Warrior story. Marr is clearly devoted to the dark side, but if you try to emulate his ""rational, pragmatic"" approach to situations you almost always end up taking light side options."

swtor,3e2k7r,Chazdoit,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:18:15 2015 UTC,"How about both?  Without going too much into the story, what if you started off as a ruthless DS acolyte and apprentice and then turned towards the light. There are moments (a big one in particular) where your character and turn from Light to Dark and vice versa.   I've never been a fan of This Character Will Be LS and This One Will Be DS; seems kinda boring to always be forced into 1 option all the time, rather create an actual 'character'.

swtor,3e2k7r,mizkyu,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:55:23 2015 UTC,"you don't have to construct a massive backstory all before you start. just feel things out as you go along. make the choices which feel 'natural' (or at least, the least artificial) for the character in the situation they're in and the options they're given."
swtor,3e2k7r,Empirestrikes1,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:28:59 2015 UTC,I might just pick options that I would personally pick if i were in the same situation  Thanks man. Now just gotta wait for 3.3 >_>
swtor,3e2k7r,arvinarvin,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:35:42 2015 UTC,"I played mine starting off going full light. During the story, there was a point that belittled me for doing this and wanted me to choose dark. I then began a full dark Sith. This is basically the last chance you have on changing your dark/light numbers enough to get a dark Jaessa."
swtor,3e2k7r,Attoru,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:36:53 2015 UTC,"Play what you think would be right for every situation, it makes the game a lot more enjoyable imo, instead of just sticking to full DS or full LS. If you haven't already, I'd suggest you turn off any alignment indicators so that you're not pressured by seeing the DS/LS symbols."
swtor,3e2k7r,EZesquire,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:25:10 2015 UTC,"Both are fun, but I tend to find the ""puppy-kicking Sith"" archetype as dull as the saintly Light Side Jedi.  Because of this, I had tons of fun playing my Warrior (mostly) Light Side.  Early on I was playing him as a dedicated servant of the Empire who isn't afraid to show mercy when needed, and later on after certain events unfold he reveals a bit of a dark side... mostly in specific instances.  Makes for a natural but interesting toon."
swtor,3e2k7r,harland45,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:17:45 2015 UTC,"The Warrior is the quintessential Sith apprentice story.  You become an apprentice.  Follow your master’s biding until such time as what happens with all Sith master/apprentice relationships.  You can play Dark side without killing puppies at every turn.  The Light side is a little out of place as the writing tends to be stronger when you play dark.   Play however you like.  If you find Light suits you more, then enjoy."
swtor,3e2k7r,harland45,0,Tue Jul 21 16:59:29 2015 UTC,"I've done 2 DS and 1 LS  DS is a typical ""kill anything that looks at me funny, I'm the strongest Sith in the galaxy and I will prove it."" You are a powerful and ruthless machine not to be opposed. You will rise to greatness and assume more power one way or another. Your obligations to your master and the Dark Council are nothing more than stepping stones to achieve your true purpose.   LS feels slightly out of place. You are pretty much seen as a really strong Sith who is ""anti the system"" (kind of like a rebellious teenager). You are  apathetic to Sith causes and don't murder everyone you can simply because ""meh."" You feel much more just along for the ride. There has been discussion over how the LS story doesn't really make sense and would never really play out.  BTW both male and female are voiced by British actors. I personally feel the male is better suited for LS and the female for DS."
swtor,3e2k7r,p4v07,2,Tue Jul 21 14:43:08 2015 UTC,I want to go female but the lack of romance options is kinda lame. I refuse to romance quinn cause he's a huge twat

swtor,3e2e19,waktivist,3,Tue Jul 21 12:49:58 2015 UTC,I have just left the zone and came back in. The 4th ground commander was there upon re-zoning. I didn't have to reset the instance.
swtor,3e2e19,Empirestrikes1,2,Tue Jul 21 13:38:39 2015 UTC,"This happened to me on all sorts of the FP (solo, tactical and hard). The only solution: leave area > Reset phase > enter again"
swtor,3e2e19,podmatrix,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:57:31 2015 UTC,"I did not realize that it could happen in the group modes as well. I wonder how often this happens to people just randomly queueing up for this FP. Or does it only happen when doing it as part of the Prelude to Revan / Forged Alliances chain?  I have tried the ""reset all phases"" step a couple of times, and when I re-enter the instance all the mobs that previously were there have respawned, and the fight is restarted, but the missing commander still is missing.  Will repeated phase resets randomly fix it at some point? I could try resetting a couple more times, but it's a bit of a hassle since there is something like a 15 minute cooldown on the reset option."
swtor,3e2e19,podmatrix,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:04:03 2015 UTC,Well I saw this problem couple of times while doing it with some guildies with GF (not part of the prelude). I really don't know why it happens and when but every time we encountered this problem reseting the phase and going in again fixes it.
swtor,3e2e19,Xorras,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:26:07 2015 UTC,"If I just queue up in Group Finder and run the [TACTICAL] version of the KI flashpoint, will that progress the Forged Alliances mission and let me then finish the rest of the FA chain in [SOLO] mode?

swtor,3dzldr,PM_ME_YOUR_CHESTHAMS,7,Mon Jul 20 21:13:11 2015 UTC,Because we couldn't test it before.
swtor,3dzldr,AezurTOR,13,Mon Jul 20 20:50:21 2015 UTC,"If it's something to do with the Stronghold, I'll laugh. There's no reason they couldn't let us test that on PTS."
swtor,3dzldr,ZeridanMoriarty,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:51:13 2015 UTC,"Actually, there is a very good reason. They wanted all players there to test and give feedback on PvP changes, not get distracted by messing around with decoration placements"
swtor,3dzldr,Aries_cz,4,Mon Jul 20 21:11:59 2015 UTC,"All well and good, but the PvP changes were on there for a month. Adding the Stronghold for the last week would have been simple. It too is as much an important part of the game as PvP for a chunk of players :P"
swtor,3dzldr,ZeridanMoriarty,0,Mon Jul 20 22:29:05 2015 UTC,"But probably not as reliant on player feedback.  BW has their internal team of testers who test most of the stuff, PTS is to provide feedback from larger number of people on things that require it (like numerical changes). Strongholds are stuff that can be easily tested by interal team.  PTS is not ""demo"" server."
swtor,3dzldr,Aries_cz,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:19:17 2015 UTC,"Indeed. It's a ""Public Test Server"" to test the game, ergo all components of the game. Which could have included Strongholds too for one week."
swtor,3dzldr,ZeridanMoriarty,2,Tue Jul 21 14:48:16 2015 UTC,"It is to test whatever the developers feel they need to test by a greater number of people (which is why they offered Coin rewards for participation in testing).  Strongholds do not require testing by large population, and can be done by internal testing team. What input could community provide with Yavin SH in your opinion?"
swtor,3dzldr,Aries_cz,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:16:21 2015 UTC,"Lol I'm not sure why there is even a point in keeping the conversation going here, since there's no reason to even argue. Test server is a test server is a test server. 3.3 had more than just PvP. Internal testing is absolutely more relevant for Strongholds, I certainly agree. However, player feedback has always been requested with Strongholds too. Not as much as other areas, granted, but it has been. Specifics? Layout areas, hook locations, collision objects, general feedback, etc., etc., etc. Moreover, internal testing has always been flawed as every other aspect of the game has seen at one point or another since launch :P   I can't change your mind you believe nothing else should have been on PTS for 3.3. Just as I firmly believe they could have carved out a small percentage of the time to let players test another aspect of the game (and YES, for some, just to explore it early. However, I'd gently point out, even testing of PvP changes is exploring early for PvPers - even if it is needed for feedback :P)."
swtor,3dzldr,ZeridanMoriarty,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:52:36 2015 UTC,I think you're making a bad assumption about the overlap between people who want to test the PVP changes and people who want to test strongholds/togruta.  The PVP community is largely low econ (not involved in new stronghold releases) or more casual in which case they did minimal testing of the PVP changes and then went back to live servers where they could have just as easily tested both features.  Not like its hard to explore the new stronghold while waiting on a warzone pop.
swtor,3dzldr,LFM_Ilvl900req,2,Tue Jul 21 15:11:30 2015 UTC,"What input could players provide with the Stronghold?  Or do you want to treat PTS as an ""early preview"", so you do not have to explore on live?"
swtor,3dzldr,Aries_cz,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:19:51 2015 UTC,"basic bug testing, aesthetics advice, feedback on unlock prices and accessibility, need for extra/different hook set-ups.  The ""mystery"" of a stronghold is practically 100% irrelevant thanks to the capacity to instantly access the full structure as soon as one is publicly listed (fairly quickly to show off for those willing to blow creds/coins on it.)"
swtor,3dzldr,LFM_Ilvl900req,5,Tue Jul 21 16:49:48 2015 UTC,There are bug fixes that are worked on after a patch goes to the PTS. One of these probably broke more than it fixed.

Three times ""I'm sorry but I'm going to have to write you up for this"",  four times ""it's just not working out for us and we have decided that you are better off elsewhere so we are letting you go"".  And it's every single time.  I dont even get mad I simply find it humorous that they feel it's ok as long as they apologize every time.  I used to work for a great manager of a large company.

swtor,3dzldr,reamde,2,Mon Jul 20 22:45:03 2015 UTC,"Out of interest, what was the patch feature that he was skipping work to see?"
swtor,3dzldr,seventhtower,2,Tue Jul 21 07:41:12 2015 UTC,We are big fans of roleplaying in swtor so this was a big deal for us both as we were planning for months to make Togruta characters.

swtor,3dzldr,Ilandar,-7,Tue Jul 21 03:23:38 2015 UTC,Who the fuck takes time off work to play video games? Is your boyfriend a neckbeard?
swtor,3dzldr,seventhtower,7,Tue Jul 21 02:19:58 2015 UTC,"No? He wanted some time off lately since he's been working hard at his job and figured with the upcoming release of this patch, which was something we were both excited for, it'd be a good time to do so. Regardless of circumstances of the patch being delayed we get some time to spend together.   If anyone is a neckbeard it's probably you with how much of a pissbaby you're being. So chill."
swtor,3dzldr,Ilandar,-8,Tue Jul 21 10:58:27 2015 UTC,I bet you're both fat as well.

swtor,3dzldr,MarkkuJ,2,Mon Jul 20 20:33:56 2015 UTC,Someone forgot to put the Gree event at end of august and they needed to rebuild everything.
swtor,3dzldr,AryaStarkBaratheon,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:57:34 2015 UTC,boooooooo  :(  I just hope they get it fixed and out quickly.
swtor,3dzldr,Lustav,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:57:12 2015 UTC,"The fact that the patch gets delayed is what it is. Annoying, but needed. I'm not into software developing, so I have no idea if it should've been caught earlier etc.  But one thing annoys me about this. They have a patch that adds some content for the first time in a loong while and they just go ""Unfortunate bug came up. Have to delay"" and then go home for the day. I mean, how severe is this bug and the delay? Will we get it tomorrow or will it take much longer?"
swtor,3dzldr,Masterstrife,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:46:45 2015 UTC,Kind of had the feeling that the patch would not be out at the promised date

swtor,3dzldr,ADG12311990,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:48:06 2015 UTC,"No, they said they would be released later on in the week."
swtor,3dzldr,whenautistscollide,0,Tue Jul 21 15:42:34 2015 UTC,People are crying about this? Why am I not surprised....
swtor,3dzldr,grabandsmash,4,Tue Jul 21 15:45:04 2015 UTC,And no doubt the same people that would be crying if it was released on time but with bugs.
swtor,3dzldr,Cabouse1337,2,Mon Jul 20 21:37:13 2015 UTC,Why can't it be released annnnd work as intended?
swtor,3dzldr,grabandsmash,5,Tue Jul 21 00:48:41 2015 UTC,Because stuff can go wrong unexpectedly its a computer program and they can defy all logic at times.

swtor,3dzldr,zakary3888,-8,Mon Jul 20 23:42:36 2015 UTC,Cartel ready to go - check   Content - jacked  This game is starting more and more like an iPhone game with in app purchases
swtor,3dzldr,p4v07,6,Tue Jul 21 07:05:13 2015 UTC,"The cartel pack has been ready for a while, it was just a matter of releasing it."
swtor,3dzldr,Guyote_,6,Mon Jul 20 21:37:19 2015 UTC,"The difference is that the pack is already in the game, so they can trigger it on and off. The content patch is the content patch. It needs to be applied and servers need to be turned off."
swtor,3dzldr,p4v07,-4,Mon Jul 20 21:48:39 2015 UTC,For fucks sake...
swtor,3dzldr,wha7z,-4,Mon Jul 20 22:03:22 2015 UTC,"Typical Bioware. At this point, I don't feel a disappointment. I was actually expecting that something would go wrong."
swtor,3dzldr,DisasterAhead,-18,Mon Jul 20 21:59:34 2015 UTC,"Jesus Christ , they are so bad at what they do. I mean come on , it's your fucking job. I can't believe they need another week to setup this patch."
swtor,3dzldr,wha7z,9,Mon Jul 20 22:04:18 2015 UTC,They never said another week you know.
swtor,3dzldr,ADG12311990,0,Mon Jul 20 21:18:24 2015 UTC,"I can't believe you people still act so nicely. I mean come on , you are paying each month for a service you don't get. Remember the SoR preorder ? When for like a week Yavin 4 was unplayable (and we payed the preorder for this extra week)? Bioware is doing what they want and nobody say a word."
swtor,3dzldr,wha7z,10,Mon Jul 20 21:40:23 2015 UTC,Because there are more important things in the world to get worry about than the content patch in a video game.
swtor,3dzldr,ADG12311990,-7,Mon Jul 20 21:57:33 2015 UTC,"Why are you talking about the world ? What's your point ? Ofc there are more important things in the world. So why dont you give me all your money & your girlfriend's number ? Why not bro , there are more important things in the wolrd , right ?  Anyway , if you like being treated like a money cow , that's your issue , but please don't blame because i'm asking for what i should get."
swtor,3dzldr,wha7z,7,Mon Jul 20 22:11:18 2015 UTC,"Uh...what? So, you would rather they release something that may be broken, instead of waiting a few days and making sure everything is working right?  Do you just want something to complain about or....?"
swtor,3dzldr,daroamer,-5,Mon Jul 20 22:21:14 2015 UTC,"They setup a day , why they didn't make any test to make sure they will not have any issue at the release ? It's not the first time something is delayed , or come out with a lot of issues. I'm just complaining about this behavior from bioware."
swtor,3dzldr,kushinpushin1,-2,Mon Jul 20 22:33:12 2015 UTC,Poop
swtor,3dzldr,NarcoticDragoon,-25,Mon Jul 20 23:46:22 2015 UTC,wow yet again biofail shows they can't do anything right.  really at this point why is anyone playing this? why are you putting money into this? so many better mmos out there like final fantasy 14 that have devs who care about the community and players. if this game didn't have the star wars name it would be dead and gone years ago.  and don't down vote me I'm speaking the truth all of you need to hear its time for tortanic to sink.
swtor,3dzldr,kushinpushin1,19,Mon Jul 20 21:12:19 2015 UTC,"I'm being genuinely curious and I'm not being accusatory or anything, but... Why are you here if you hate the game and want it to fail? Wouldn't your time be better spent in a game that you enjoy, or conversing about a game you enjoy on said game's subreddit?"
swtor,3dzldr,Ocerion,-28,Mon Jul 20 22:12:55 2015 UTC,"u really wanna know why?  look at gaming right now it sucks. we have tortanic ripping people off and being anti-consumer we have sjws ruining everything. we have shit like Microsoft and others looking to rip us off at every chance we get and I am sick of it  tor is the biggest sign of why gaming sucks the minute it gos it will show people that we the consumer have the power not the devs not the sjw not the people ruining everything for us.  yet all any of u do is support biofail by giving them money WHY? they are the ones who ruined mass effect, dragon age and anything they touch. if sony still had star wars mmos we'd have an updated swg by now. know what I'm starting a new community one that will share real news and talk about why tor has to go"
swtor,3dzldr,ADG12311990,8,Mon Jul 20 22:16:58 2015 UTC,"Weak troll game. Perfection comes with practice however, but might I suggest a little more effort regarding topic."

swtor,3dzldr,Lumberj,7,Mon Jul 20 23:32:38 2015 UTC,"Collection investment, maximum raid encounter difficulty, minimum hardware requirements, the writing, and (while it's not the best either) the PVP are all reasons to keep playing."
swtor,3dzldr,zakary3888,12,Mon Jul 20 23:23:20 2015 UTC,We play because it drives you nuts and we laugh at your tears of anguish.
swtor,3dzldr,Donavarion,8,Mon Jul 20 23:45:48 2015 UTC,so many better mmos out there like final fantasy 14 that have devs who care about the community and players.    Being threatened and harassed by the community you're supposed to care about probably doesn't help....
swtor,3dzldr,Jyiiga,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:32:47 2015 UTC,"if this game didn't have the star wars name it would be dead and gone years ago   To be honest, he is somewhat right about that."
swtor,3e1h6n,Conundrum-NSA,16,Tue Jul 21 05:54:52 2015 UTC,"Welcome to the ""throw the tosser out the airlock"" club!!! :D ~hands you a cookie~"
swtor,3e1h6n,eboncat,44,Tue Jul 21 10:34:44 2015 UTC,"What was he supposed to do? Go against an extremely powerful and cunning Darth whom not only saved his career but also has claimed to be the Voice of the Emperor, and has the power to back up that claim? Or go against his wayward apprentice?  Think about it; you were on Quesh. The atmosphere itself will drive you mad if not kill you outright if you don't have the right protection. You were injured in a huge underground explosion; it's a miracle you're even alive and sane. But from Quinn's point of view... are you? You come back with two psycho Purebloods and start talking about how you're the Emperor's Wrath and are going to kill Baras, a cunning Darth who can play a huge roll in the destruction of the Republic, and has already started to systematically destroy it. You then proceed to attack Baras' powerbase, and in the process injure and kill dozens if not hundreds of Imperials. In the middle of the turning point of the war.  If I were in Quinn's position, I would do exactly the same think he did. I know it's easy to hate him for what he did, but he was doing what he thought was right for the preservation of the Empire."
swtor,3e1h6n,TrueMarksmens,15,Tue Jul 21 07:14:25 2015 UTC,What was he supposed to do?   Not be a complete and utter smug asshole about it for starters.
swtor,3e1h6n,HairlessWookiee,6,Tue Jul 21 09:56:03 2015 UTC,"And probably not pick a fight with someone who actually made a career out of murdering your master's enemies.   Which includes multiple powerful Jedi Masters (One of whom defeated Darth Baras, and nearly killed him) and his Master / Dark Council member.   Especially when your plan is, ""Lol, I'm going to tell him I'm going to kill him and use two droids that are the exact sort he's destroyed a few hundred times."""
swtor,3e1h6n,BillNyedasNaziSpy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:39:51 2015 UTC,"To be fair, story-wise if he actually had made those droids perfectly counter your every move I'm sure he would have a reason to think that he may have a chance to take you out."
swtor,3e1h6n,ANAL_Devestate,2,Tue Jul 21 17:53:53 2015 UTC,"Nonsense. Making it to that point in the story suggests that you have never been killed or even heavily damaged. It should have just been assumed you were invincible. Or at least strong enough on your weakest day to handle a blaster and a couple of droids. ""I'm a fucking Jugg, bitch! You were right there as I went planet to planet and eradicated packs of monsters, aliens, and droids. I single handedly eliminated shady underground organizations and legions of rogue military experts. You watched me corrupt Jaesa and turn her into a murder machine. I own Nar Shaddaa and even the Hutts fear me. Wha chu got? You got a blaster I equipped you with and a little medical scanner thingy. I wear heavy armor, you wear a monkey suit. I never asked you to kneel, I only requested you fall in line."""
swtor,3e1h6n,Ten_bucks_best_offer,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:56:03 2015 UTC,Not be alluring with that accent thus making you sleep with him and contemplate marriage then hurting your feels and ultimately unable to kill him. It's all relative.
swtor,3e1h6n,Asari_Lover,18,Tue Jul 21 13:30:54 2015 UTC,"You don't have to kill almost any Imps on Belsavis, and can go out of your way in front of Quinn to try to get the ones who oppose you to see the light and not die pointlessly to the Empire's detriment. Not everyone plays dark side. A light side Warrior is by this point so far above any other Sith in terms of not ripping the Empire to pieces in petty bullshit cockfights that it's absurd, and Quinn is far too smart to think otherwise.  Although, in the end, it's really less about Quinn's ultimate loyalty to Baras (unless you're married at that point, in which case holy shit is that a betrayal), and more his sheer idiocy in thinking he can kill you. In an open, announced ambush. With nothing but a pair of war droids to back him up. A Sith would be a fool to expect loyalty from anyone, but she'd be a greater fool to tolerate incompetence.   Maybe he'd have half a prayer if he poisoned the Wrath in her sleep. He probably wouldn't make it off the ship alive, especially if Jaesa is psycho!Jaesa, but if he really believes it's for the good of the Empire he should be willing to pay that price."
swtor,3e1h6n,sindeloke,3,Tue Jul 21 09:21:51 2015 UTC,"...more his sheer idiocy in thinking he can kill you...   Pretty much this. Basically given the choice of confessing to/placating the person he is actively around and who's ship he is currently living on or honoring a commitment he made to a Darth, who's power is clearly faltering (even if it won't fail), how does Quinn choose the worst possible option: individual open combat?"
swtor,3e1h6n,oofalong,7,Tue Jul 21 14:14:18 2015 UTC,"Oh I hear you, like Loghain in Dragon Age Origins, I can understand his motives (ish) from a military standpoint...  BUT, from a player character stand point... My Sith's stand point, he is a duplicitous, two faced, whiny, power grabbing, lying, unconscionably disloyal mutt of a man who would have been force chocked the second she caught wind of his betrayal.   He works for the SW, not Baras. His loyalty was to HER, and even as a light 5 Sith, she would... COULD not have let him live. It would show a completely untenable weakness that  would be exploited by every enemy she has if she shows that kind of mindless idiotic mercy for that level of betrayal by those in her inner circle."
swtor,3e1h6n,eboncat,3,Tue Jul 21 10:41:18 2015 UTC,"He works for the SW, not Baras. His loyalty was to HER, and even as a light 5 Sith, she would... COULD not have let him live. It would show a completely untenable weakness that would be exploited by every enemy she has if she shows that kind of mindless idiotic mercy for that level of betrayal by those in her inner circle.   Especially if you romanced him. If you disregard the logic of eliminating the traitor to ensure the loyalty of your followers, it would have made a substantially more dramatic story for the Wrath to kill her former lover in a rage of passion which changes her perception of trust and relationships forever. Sorta like a better written Revenge of the Sith, er, literally."
swtor,3e1h6n,Asari_Lover,26,Tue Jul 21 13:39:07 2015 UTC,Feel free to join him in the airlock :)
swtor,3e1h6n,Vect_Machine,7,Tue Jul 21 07:17:12 2015 UTC,"I get the feeling that things wouldn't have been so bad had his betrayal not been set in stone and you could affect his ultimate allegiance. Like, say you get his affection to a certain level and complete a special mission for him and he'll actually confess beforehand that he's an agent of Baras and defect to you. That or give him a motive other than simply ""Baras is my real boss"". Perhaps Baras is not only capable of destroying his career but also that of any family members/friends he has (doesn't matter if they're Admirals or Moffs, big guy's willing to get anyone killed if he needs to).  The situation with Quinn reminds me a lot of the situation with Anders in DA II. No matter how your relationship is with him, he'll always screw you over and there's nothing you can do to stop it. You can at least kill Anders, which is mostly due to that game being a single-player RPG while as an MMO, TOR has certain limitations (also, both Anders and Quinn are healers, meaning that they are characters that most players find too useful to kill)."
swtor,3e1h6n,flameofmiztli,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:00:00 2015 UTC,"I really love your idea of being able to affect allegiance. After all, there's XML subtitles form the beta files that show him being willing to leave the PC's party if you do things he doesn't like. Being able to force him out or keep him in is interesting, as would be talking him out of things. I also really like the hostage idea."
swtor,3e1h6n,Chazdoit,2,Tue Jul 21 13:37:59 2015 UTC,"You affection level determining your companion allegiance? That sounds awesome, like you know...   in many other Bioware and RPG games? =P  BW truly sacrificed a lot in order to appeal to the MMO crowd =/"
swtor,3e1h6n,srmalloy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:22:53 2015 UTC,"You affection level determining your companion allegiance? That sounds awesome, like you know...   in many other Bioware and RPG games?   This may be something that Bioware will be trying to work back into the game with KotFE. It would make things more interesting. Having the willingness of companions to return be driven by their affection before you go into the new content, so that you'd have to work harder to get a less-committed companion back, would be more fun than just chasing them down and having them sign right back up."
swtor,3e1h6n,Chazdoit,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:34:27 2015 UTC,"I think they mentioned that in KotFE you new companions might leave you if you piss them off, I'm almost certain, but I don't have a source for this."
swtor,3e1h6n,Vect_Machine,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:50:43 2015 UTC,"I do believe that had the game been a single-player RPG, there would have been more option. Granted, we wouldn't have ended up with 8 different storylines, likely just getting the regular Jedi Knight storyline.  An alternative situation I just thought of is basically something like the Wrex dilemma of Mass Effect 1 where once he lures you to the trap you have to talk him out of going through with it. It could be something of a dialog puzzle similar to talking down Jadus where you have to choose the right responses (or as noted, high enough Affection/Special Quest completed automatically gets you the best resolution). If you succeed, he doesn't go through with it and you can decide what to do with the droids (keep them around as personal weapons or destroy them) and if you fail he goes through with it and we get what we see in the game."
swtor,3e1h6n,Chazdoit,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:20:48 2015 UTC,"The dialogue puzzle with Jadus is one of the best parts of this game, only after 3 years I discovered it was actually possible to talk him down, a hidden option, if you will, since the three obvious options laid before you are join him/pretend to join him but actually troll him/don't join him and disarm the erradicators."
swtor,3e1h6n,Cheveyo,4,Tue Jul 21 17:31:13 2015 UTC,"For me, it wasn't JUST the betrayal. It was his ineptitude.  Countless times, again and again, he underestimates you. He does it from the moment you meet him to beyond the point where he tries betraying you."
swtor,3e1h6n,Asari_Lover,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:07:45 2015 UTC,"That could be the recurring motif of the SW story from the beginning; both Sith stories if you consider it. You are constantly underestimated from the moment you touch down on Korriban despite being Sith nobility. Throughout the story countless enemies including your master and allies comment how you are not expected to survive or you should be dead, yet, you keep coming back.   It's one of the reasons I believe the poster image for the SW regardless of gender should be a juggernaut, she will not die and it's terrifying. Hell even the name of your class buff is, ""Unnatural Might"". You are strong, stronger than even the greatest heroes of your era and that strength is rightly considered by friends and foes to be, unnatural."
swtor,3e1h6n,HairlessWookiee,2,Tue Jul 21 13:46:53 2015 UTC,"You are constantly underestimated   ""If I had a credit for every time someone I was about to kill predicted my doom...""."
swtor,3e1h6n,Chazdoit,2,Tue Jul 21 15:28:34 2015 UTC,"That's because in the Old Republic era, there is a clear difference between what Quinn calls ""Ordinary Sith"" and those who are truly strong in the force.  Quinn and everyone else, kinda expect you to be the former rather than the latter, and that's why they are surprised when you beat them, they just can't believe it.  When you're an acolyte you defeat your Overseer  When you're a mere apprentice, you beat Jedi Masters  When you're a lord to defeat Dark Council members  This is similar to the Sith Inquisitor story, which leads me to believe they are the strongest Sith in the Empire by the time we reach Ziost...   or even by lvl 50."
swtor,3e1h6n,MuleTeaPass,2,Tue Jul 21 15:29:47 2015 UTC,Except for the part where he's witness to you destroying numerous more powerful enemies than him.  His solution?  A couple of droids.  Come on Quinn grow a brain.
swtor,3e1h6n,Asari_Lover,2,Tue Jul 21 12:31:49 2015 UTC,"If he was in cahoots with a team of dark Jedi who were promised by Quinn that if they killed you they would be introduced to Baras aka Voice of the Emperor than that would be a better trap. It would also hark back to that famed event when Darth Vader was ambushed by 9 Jedi and survived; after all, since Vader is the Wrath's class influence it would have made the player feel a rush of badarsery to defeat 7-9 strong-level Jedi defectors while Quinn watched utterly baffled."
swtor,3e1h6n,Chazdoit,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:52:27 2015 UTC,"While the warrior is supposed to take heavy inspiration from Vader and mirror him in some ways, the developers were always talking about the ""Movie/George Lucas Vader"", not necessarily the Vader we get to know through novelizations or comics, because much like in Video Games, comics and books also take a lot of artistic freedom.  I think taking on 9 Jedi Masters at a time it's impossible and something we'll never see in a movie,  in RoTS we see Sidious taking on 4 Jedi Masters, kill 3, but get disarmed and knocked down by the fourth one, Mace Windu."
swtor,3e1h6n,Asari_Lover,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:37:58 2015 UTC,"Very true, but I didn't imply Jedi Masters per say since that would be extremely implausible but I was thinking 3-4 fallen Jedi knights (silver difficulty) or even 7-8 dark side Jedi padawans (standard mob) supported by healing droids. Just something more cinematic than two generic combat droids."
swtor,3e1h6n,Chazdoit,2,Tue Jul 21 16:27:15 2015 UTC,"Yes...   I kinda was like ""Really, Quinn? Two droids?""  If not for treason he should have been killed for incompetence and for insulting and disrespecting the Warrior by bringing two stupid droids to kill him."
swtor,3e1h6n,flameofmiztli,3,Tue Jul 21 16:50:56 2015 UTC,"I'd never thought about the part where Quesh's atmosphere could have made you be hallucinating, that's an interesting point.  I also agree that he made a call that was sensible for him to consider. The PC vs Baras is like the irresistible force and the immovable object. Both are incredibly powerful individuals who have been reshaping the galaxy. On the one hand, there's Baras, who has overseen him for years and who successfully pushed the Empire back into war. On the other hand, Quinn's never probably spent a lot of time up close with Baras, just carried out his orders from afar. In contrast, he's seen you fight, he's seen the marvelous things you've accomplished, and he's probably heard downtime chatter from you about your plans from the Empire. That possibly could have or should have swayed him out of it.  Honestly, I feel sorry for him, more than anything else. He's put in a shitty position of having to choose one of you, and he backs who he's known longer. I can see why he did it. It also sucks for loyal Imperials who just want to fight for their nation to have to be stuck between two powerful, charismatic Sith Lords who are busy tearing up each other."

swtor,3e1h6n,AryaStarkBaratheon,4,Tue Jul 21 12:16:39 2015 UTC,"thank you! :D  I wish they had fleshed out his story more about this, especially the actually being sorry. It would have been nice to have a conversation about it where you really see his regrets.  My guess is that those robots were easy to kill, and it was sort of his way of 'trying' but knowing he was going to fail because he really does not want you dead."
swtor,3e1h6n,EZesquire,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:44:47 2015 UTC,"He did not have a problem killing imperials when it was in his interest.  Don’t forget that big favor I did for Quinn.  To show his gratitude the first chance he gets he plans to kill me.     And he was always working for Baras not just after Quesh so he can forget that excuse as well.  And by the time he tries I am much more than a wayward apprentice.  I think I proved by this point that I am cunning, extremely powerful and I can back up my claim as the Emperor’s Wrath.  Not to mention he was their when the Emperor told me I was his Wrath  He also heard to Pure Bloods say he was not the true voice so he at least should question if Baras is honest.  He also knows Baras was hiding a fleet on Hoth to ruin the plans on Corellia and Darth Vowran.  He saw you kill Baras apprentice who was supposed to be able to kill me.  He really has no excuse.  As someone who is supposed to be a good tactical advisor he sure read that situation wrong."
swtor,3e1h6n,ULiopleurodon,4,Tue Jul 21 14:13:34 2015 UTC,"I brutally tortured Quinn during the mission, but I forgave him, he's a good officer, and since then he's been a loyal companion. Now, Skadge on the other hand..."
swtor,3e1h6n,isaac161000,3,Tue Jul 21 16:58:25 2015 UTC,The guy annoys me because of how big an ass kisser he is.
swtor,3e1h6n,dracfett,3,Tue Jul 21 14:51:50 2015 UTC,Quinn was damned either which way. Look at it from his pov. Baras helped him and was his master before warrior. Baras is the warriors master. But the warrior is also his master but baras' apprentice. So which master does he follow. Sith council member or a sith lord ? I still like and use Quinn. If you want some one to throw out the airlock throw Lana and Theron for letting the sith and republic be invaded by new empire. Or for their monumental failures thru forge alliance and SOR.
swtor,3e1h6n,Zanios74,0,Tue Jul 21 16:52:20 2015 UTC,"See My sith would not so quick as to just kill Quinn.  First I would take him prisoner and daily beat him with in a inch of his life when I am done I will send 2V-R8 to patch him up and leave. 2V-R8 will after a will inform him that he is also working their mutual benefactor. The plain will be to remove a section of the wall to escape. The night of the ""escape"" everything will be pitch black a per the plan, when that section of wall is removed the head of Quinns benefactor will be there. At this point Quinn will never see another human or robot for the rest of life. When the lack of water or food become a health issue a knock out gas will be delivered in to his cell he will be sedated and given IVs to bring him back to health. Then once everything is removed he will be allowed to come to. Never to see any person or droid other then the head of his benefactor."
