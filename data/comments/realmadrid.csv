realmadrid,3e35is,Kanon27,32,Tue Jul 21 16:29:34 2015 UTC,"Firstly, use public transportation. You can get it direct to the stadium and you'll avoid congestion along the parkways.  Second, make time for the Berna tour. It's well worth it and helps put things into perspective especially when you digitally reside in a community with some die hards but also with many new ones unaware of our rich history.  Third, get to the stadium as early as possible. A lot of people hit bars, etc. and that's fine but honestly - if it's your first - get in as early as possible. Sit there, enjoy the field prep, and absorb the fact that you are sitting in front of not only the best team on Earth but also the best MATCHUP on Earth. Nothing else compares to it. Nothing.  Beyond the match, make preparations for food and entertainment away from the stadium as everything will be packed. It'll be Madridistas, Cules, and a lot of foreigners.   Spain has an awesome nightlife. Dress well. Everyone dresses well for everything. Go full peacock. Remember life starts late there as well as opposed to other countries.  You will have access, beyond football, to some of the best restaurants on Earth, and some of the most beautiful people you'll see.  Try to get reservations at http://diverxo.com/ They just got rated 3 Mich stars and, although it's expensiiiveeeeeeeeeee, it's cutting edge, top of the line food. You just saw the best match on Earth, it's time to get some of the best food.  And my final piece of advice and the most IMPORTANT one.... take pictures before, take pictures during even.. take some after.. but...  Don't record the match.  BEING, GOL, C+ will all do a better job than you. Don't miss out on the excitement as you watch a live game through a smaller, low definition screen versus say... one at a bar or at home.  Enjoy it man. Be careful with the pickpockets and street scammers. I'm biased when I say this but honestly.. I've traveled the world and nothing compares to Spain.  Enjoy it and if you need more info, pm me."

Even if you ignore his phenomenal win rate, the trophies, La Decima, etc. the man is still pure class. But biggest of all is that a fully fit Madrid under Carlo is the best I have ever seen our club play.  That said, I was so excited when Mou arrived, but he left a bitter taste by the end (for reasons we've all debated and rehashed a million times). I was ready for the reign of Madrid to begin, given how successful he was at every previous club, but he somehow managed to do less with more. He divided the team and really had to go by the end."

Also, while I kind of enjoyed his antics, they could be a little much, even embarrassing, at times. But damn, I loved his passion. And his football.  So Ancelotti is my choice. His eyebrow, his calmness, his chewing gum, the fact that he's become a Madridista. All of his little quirks make him so endearing to me. And I just love how much the players loved him. They really became a team of friends under Carlo, and played some of the most beautiful football I've seen at Madrid. And of course la décima!"

realmadrid,3e32xu,bLAZYY,11,Tue Jul 21 16:10:58 2015 UTC,"I have faith in Benitez, he has passion for the club and likes to rotate between players. Something Carlo never did and it costed him his job. Hopefully something good comes out of it this season. As for Benz, I think its just a rumor and that he's not going anywhere. But then again i've seen rumors that we bid on Reus. So maybe Ronaldo to strike with Reus and Bale on the wings? Who knows. It will all clear up towards the end of the transfer window."
realmadrid,3e32xu,catlicker9000,4,Tue Jul 21 16:33:10 2015 UTC,"Benitez is a great manager and I feel he can really improve Real's game both defensively and attacking-wise. So far transfers have been great imo but we still need someone (maybe a DM or Box to Box?).  I don't believe the Benz rumours because Arsenal get linked with him, Higuain and Cavani almost every window.  I guess Ronaldo could be played up top along Benz... We'll have to see when the season has properly started."
realmadrid,3e32xu,MaPSisFox,6,Tue Jul 21 16:37:50 2015 UTC,"Benitez looks like a good guy, he's definitely brining change. For better or for worse? We'll find out eventually. But one thing I don't like is that it looks like he's just a puppet of Perez. Carlo's decisions were definitely influenced by Perez's preferences and it looks the same with Benitez but to a higher degree. So many rumors now-a-days that is hard to know until it actually happens. Ramos looked as good as gone a few weeks ago. Ronaldo doesn't want to play striker, and I don't think he's cut out to be a lone striker so it's good if he went back to the left wing. It would give us more options and variety in attack as opposed to just having crosses sent in to him in the box like last season. And he's still quick enough to play on the wing, no reason why it shouldn't work out. Our transfer season hasn't been spectacular but it has definitely changed the shape of the team. Casemiro is back (an OK DM), Casillas leaving has definitely taken away from the small amount of leadership the team already had, but it's something that many felt had to happen unfortunately."
realmadrid,3e32xu,jmartinez042899,5,Tue Jul 21 17:33:20 2015 UTC,"I think the Benzema rumor is just a rumor since it's been a rumor for years now that he's going to arsenal, it's like the Reus to Liverpool rumor, comes out of nowhere but makes no sense in reality."
realmadrid,3e32xu,tacobale,2,Tue Jul 21 16:29:45 2015 UTC,"Benitez has not exceeded at a club in quite a few years, but I am rather optimistic about what our future with him holds.  I like the idea of going back to a 4-2-3-1 formation, I love the prospect of reverting to counter-attacking football, and his penchant for squad rotation has everyone on this sub giddy with joy, and with good reason!  Last season Carlo had his mind set on his starters and there was little to no deviation from the same familiar line-up.  As such, you had Kroos complaining about the insane amount of minutes back in December and we were plagued with injuries.   As far as Big Benz, I really don't see him leaving. Every damn summer there are rumours that he is being sold despite him repeating over and over that he is happy where he is.  I wouldn't put much hope that you will wrestle away a striker who is easily top 5 right now from a team that has no opportunity at getting a decent replacement.  In terms of Cristiano, I really doubt he would be moved to a lone striker role.  He prefers playing on the wing and I think everyone wants him there."

realmadrid,3e3cyr,pyroaxis,16,Tue Jul 21 17:19:47 2015 UTC,"Nothing much beyond the fact that the person who he sold it to has interests in Spain with Valencia and is a billionaire investor.   Instead of buying another midtable club, he bought the world's most marketable football player. He saw how Beckham's worth increased as he transitioned to US football and US media and that's most likely what he sees in Cristiano.  For me, the great thing about all of this is that it hopefully is a good sign for Valencia.  They're a fantastic team and I hope they can do what Atletico did and manage stability to stay in the top 4, compete for Europe, advance from group stages, etc.  With Lim owning 70 percent of the club, Cristiano's image rights and being a BILLIONAIRE besides... I hope the biggest beneficiary is Valencia for the sake of Spanish football's longevity - specifically in a timeline where Messi and Cris are gone.  As for rumors that it means that a rift exists with Perez and Cris or Madrid - they are false.  Cristiano is a media figure whose image exceeds that of the constraints of Madrid football. I doubt he'll retire at Madrid, he'll most likely go to the US and improve upon the groundwork that Beckham laid for football superstars with image power."

I can easily say that he is one of our most talented players and he can adapt to any position you put him in to. ( last season he played out of position but he was able to adapt and prove himself)  I also mentioned in this post that they should try and play him furtherup in the pitch behind ( CR7 --- Benzy/Bale)."
realmadrid,3e2pr5,ace-s,2,Tue Jul 21 15:02:53 2015 UTC,"I think he may yet really come to flourish here.  There were the rumours that Benitez very early on called him on the phone to persuade him not to leave when he was somewhat set on moving.  Supposedly it worked.  If that's true, Benitez is a fucking hero and I can't wait to see Isco perform under him."
realmadrid,3e2pr5,Commandophile,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:23:48 2015 UTC,I feel like all the apprehension about him will fade away very quickly. We are going to play some good futbol under him!

realmadrid,3e2pr5,Negrodamus06,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:29:04 2015 UTC,"Yup. I was commenting on your post as well. I believe Isco is going to be an absolute superstar, a la Iniesta, and he needs as many minutes as possible in his preferred number 10 role. He is a definite hard worker and really developed his defensive game in two seasons under Carlo. I think Rafa will do things his way without letting outside forces dictate his style, selection, and formation."

Not that Isco isn't good enough, but well because I don't think management wants to bench a 100 million euro player. I honestly think he should be starting over Bale because Isco in my opinion, is better in every aspect minus speed and probably free kicks."
realmadrid,3e4fgt,Mymvenom001,3,Tue Jul 21 21:45:01 2015 UTC,"I'd say Modric #19. If you were to go with Isco and the pink jersey, you'd have to use #23 and its not as relevant currently as Modric's jersey would be. Both are amazing talents, so you can't miss really."

realmadrid,3e17h3,LosBlancosSR4,16,Tue Jul 21 04:34:44 2015 UTC,More detailed player faces probably.
realmadrid,3e17h3,CrAppyF33ling,11,Tue Jul 21 04:44:53 2015 UTC,I think that means our players get the face scan treatment.
realmadrid,3e17h3,Tigriski,3,Tue Jul 21 04:45:28 2015 UTC,Probably just that they will be in the demo with barca and others
realmadrid,3e17h3,ThatShitMe,4,Tue Jul 21 12:41:16 2015 UTC,The real question is does EA give bale the bearded man bun or the headband tiara from last year?

realmadrid,3e17h3,LasDen,7,Tue Jul 21 14:32:41 2015 UTC,Does this mean we don't have to see Messi's face on the cover anymore?
realmadrid,3e17h3,Mixalisaltous,5,Tue Jul 21 06:21:31 2015 UTC,Not this year at least. Maybe it means they will both have the same rating tho

realmadrid,3dyu9j,pyroaxis,15,Mon Jul 20 17:21:17 2015 UTC,Same story every year.
realmadrid,3dyu9j,Micke38,6,Mon Jul 20 17:42:02 2015 UTC,"What a load of nonsense. Benzema goes out of his way to regularly state that he has zero desire to leave but somehow is now cool with it after one preseason friendly? Journos say he doesn't fit the profile of a Benitez striker when days ago they were claiming Benitez requested Llorente, who's not at all the type of desired striker mentioned in this report? They base this on him not starting a meaningless friendly but ignore that he showed up a bit later than some other players, namely Jese who has been working with Benitez since day one?"
realmadrid,3dyu9j,bozz14,6,Mon Jul 20 17:26:28 2015 UTC,Arsenal fans are delusional if they think they are going to get Benzema.
realmadrid,3dyu9j,franbatista123,7,Mon Jul 20 21:43:41 2015 UTC,"How? I guarantee you people said he same things about Özil, Alexis, and Cêch."
realmadrid,3dyu9j,NarwhalWhat,8,Tue Jul 21 04:07:29 2015 UTC,Well all 3 of those guys had competition for a starting spot and either weren't getting the playing time they wanted or were afraid that they weren't going to. On the other hand Benzema performs brilliantly for Real and there are really no other true strikers at the world class level on the squad.
realmadrid,3dyu9j,ypatel94,3,Tue Jul 21 06:08:27 2015 UTC,"Bought Bale -> Sold Ozil  Bought James -> Sold Di Maria  Angel and Mesut didn't want to leave either, but we sold them just the same. If we sign a big name attacking player my bet is he gets sold like those two did because there's no one else that we could justifiably move to make way (Ronaldo and Bale are untouchable plus we need to meet the Spanish/homegrown quota).  Unfortunately I don't think we'll sign a big player like Reus so the above scenario won't happen."
realmadrid,3dyu9j,Electric_Pegasus,6,Mon Jul 20 19:39:02 2015 UTC,"In all honesty who is really a better or bigger name striker they could get than Benz?  The only players that fit that criteria are like Ibra, Lewandowski, Rooney, Aguero, or possibly Lacazette.  World class strikers are just rare these days."

realmadrid,3dyu9j,ISCOREDwithISCO,-2,Mon Jul 20 20:04:43 2015 UTC,"Both Ozil and Di María wanted to leave   No, Ozil and Di Maria wanted bigger contracts and the aggressive negotiation of their agents basically convinced the club that they weren't worth the trouble and sold them after signing high profile replacements. Ozil fired his dad a few months after leaving Madrid and still tweets about watching Madrid play. Di Maria according to reports wanted to leave United and come back to Madrid but the club wasn't having it.   As for your edit this is incorrect, there absolutely is a homegrown quota for the Champions League. This is the main reason we keep Arbeloa around (plus the fact that he is a cool dude doesn't hurt). Plus there is an ""unofficial"" quota for Spanish players that the Club will not try to upset too much so players like Isco, Jese, Dani and hopefully Asensio will be looked after under Rafa."

I'm not saying the guy is terrible but he came from a much smaller club and has yet to really even see many starts for us. While I'd like to be optimistic about the situation the reality is that he is not a world class keeper as of now and neither is Casilla, what remains to be seen is how they will perform this season but they are by no means as good as Lopez or Casillas (circa 2 years ago)"
realmadrid,3ducm0,Foxtrot68W,8,Mon Jul 20 17:29:42 2015 UTC,"I disagree. I think that showing concerns is fine, but Keylor absolutely is World Class, he showed it at Levante, and has continuously showed it at his NT. For some reason he is still underestimated.   And now it's up to him to prove people wrong. He is given what was missing, which is a fair shot. He'll be mercilessly questioned by the media for every mistake so if he plans to stay another season, he has to be perfect. I believe he won't disappoint."

realmadrid,3dvo37,golferdudeag,-3,Mon Jul 20 05:13:08 2015 UTC,"Morata timing was fine the only reason he isn't still with Madrid is because Ancelotti is a failure at developing young players. Not even this sub's beloved Benzema can say that he scored two goals in the Champions League semi final and another goal in the final. Morata can and he has everything that it takes to do it a few more times.    Anyway Asensio is the truth, I hope Rafa can ease him in to the squad soon."
realmadrid,3dvo37,Electric_Pegasus,5,Mon Jul 20 16:21:34 2015 UTC,"Ancelotti was given two seasons in a must-win now club, how much development could he realistically pull off? Carvajal grew under him, Isco developed from an attacking midfielder into something so much more, Jese broke out with Ancelotti prior to his injury. Even ADM and Kroos' flexibility and skills grew under him in their newer roles. Morata was never going to fully take off at Madrid as a young striker needs as many minutes as possible and he wasn't going to get that behind a world class striker in a one striker system. He had to have left in order to develop to the max, even if he was rotated in more at Madrid it wouldn't have been the same as being a regular starter elsewhere.  I don't even know why the dig at Benz is necessary considering his fantastic CL goal return."
realmadrid,3dvo37,bozz14,-2,Mon Jul 20 16:35:47 2015 UTC,"Ancelotti was given two seasons in a must-win now club, how much development could he realistically pull off?    How about just enough to not let Morata knock us out of the Champions League semi final? Literally just that would have been enough. He literally didn't even try to let him help the team and he would have done the same for Isco had it not been for timely injuries. All in all Carlo's squad management was atrocious and destroyed not only the fitness of the team last season but also the short term and possibly long term futures of young talented players from our academy like Morata obviously and even Jese (I'll never forget Carlo subbing Jese into a game with just a few seconds left before full time as if he was humiliating him publicly).   I don't even know why the dig at Benz is necessary considering his fantastic CL goal return.   Yeah forgive me for not being impressed with his CL goal tally, the overwhelming majority of his goals in the competition are against group stage teams who would be midtable in La Liga. The only important decisive goal he has scored in the CL for Madrid was against Bayern in the semis two years ago.   This will get downvotes for sure because this sub has the biggest hard on for Benzema but for me he is the biggest myth in Madrid's history. He gets to piggy back on Cristiano and that somehow convinces people that he deserves the protection he gets. He doesn't track back or press, he isn't decisive when the team needs to win a tough away game (in fact he is usually invisible), his magical link up play has never seen him lead any assists table despite playing with a guy who averages 50 goals a season and if anyone even threatens his starting position (and it happens every year because he goes missing for at least two months a season) they immediately get shipped out. I dislike him because no one wants to hold him accountable and yet some idiots call for Ronaldo's head and criticize Bale even though he has done more for Madrid in one year than Benzema has done in six, however to be fair last year Bale played very poorly overall."
realmadrid,3dvo37,Electric_Pegasus,2,Mon Jul 20 19:28:16 2015 UTC,"Your expectations for Benzema are far too high. Despite Madrid churning out goals all season long and scoring the most in the league, people still want more.  He is perfect for this squad in his role. When our front 3 are all in top form, the last thing we want is egos going head to head. It already happened a bit last season with Ronaldo and Bale. Benzema is calm and cool. His attitude, along with his goal scoring ability (he's a top 10 goalscorer for the league), is why he is loved in RM."
realmadrid,3dul7o,pien11,12,Sun Jul 19 17:01:43 2015 UTC,"He's 30 years old, unless we get him for a sub 5 million fee or a free I really can't see how this is in anyway a solid investment"
realmadrid,3dul7o,Foxtrot68W,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:45:09 2015 UTC,"Juve bringing in young players and offloading old ones, I think we can get him for a good deal. I think under 10 isn't too much because he's a proven striker in La Liga."
realmadrid,3dul7o,CrAppyF33ling,-5,Sun Jul 19 18:59:54 2015 UTC,lol it's a sad state of affairs when we're getting old players offloaded to us instead of doing the offloading
realmadrid,3dul7o,Foxtrot68W,3,Sun Jul 19 19:10:06 2015 UTC,"I think it's fine. Old players getting offloaded is never a long term business so I don't see why we can't have Llorente, who's still functional and not that old be a back up to Benz. We can't have a 22-27 year old striker be back up every single time."
realmadrid,3dul7o,CrAppyF33ling,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:13:57 2015 UTC,"He scored 9 goals in 45 appearances last season, part of the problem with Benz is that he's not clinical enough. Why would we bring on someone with the same problem, we want an alternative."
realmadrid,3dul7o,Foxtrot68W,0,Mon Jul 20 11:47:05 2015 UTC,"So you want an alternative, and your definition of alternative is someone else who can score goals the same way as Benz and not someone who can score goals in a different situation? Okay. What you're looking for is a replacement for Benz, might as well sell Benz too and still bring in Llorente."
realmadrid,3dul7o,CrAppyF33ling,2,Mon Jul 20 11:50:51 2015 UTC,"What the actual fuck? You seem to have completely missed my point, I said Benz is not ""Clinical"" which is an established fact. So I want someone who can be more clinical to come in so that when Benz isn't playing we don't have someone with the same primary fault as Benz."
realmadrid,3dul7o,Foxtrot68W,0,Mon Jul 20 12:59:29 2015 UTC,"I did not miss your point. I was saying, we need a back up/alternative. Benz is pretty clinical himself. A more clinical striker would outright replace him. An alternative that's more clinical is not going to happen because then he'd just start over Benz. That's not an alternative, that's a replacement. An alternative is someone that can change the game, being more clinical does not change a game if the striker is going to be marked the same way Benz is."
realmadrid,3dul7o,CrAppyF33ling,4,Mon Jul 20 13:56:14 2015 UTC,How do you all feel about Llorente as our backup striker for Benzema? This rumour looks particularly reliable to me because Di Marzio reported a few days ago that we were interested in signing him.
realmadrid,3dul7o,tefftlon,3,Sun Jul 19 17:03:14 2015 UTC,"As a backup, I guess he is a good option. Never been a big fan though. Not sure he has the speed to ever be effective from the start."

realmadrid,3dunlr,ChedduhBob,8,Mon Jul 20 05:37:35 2015 UTC,"i think its always easy to take shots when you leave a club.  i mean there are certain things that may be true. Perez doesn't seem to go after black players as much, but i think that has been more to the fact that there haven't been too many in the modern era that would fit his ideal galactico mold. Pogba is the only one today that I would consider a galactico esque signing. How many top clubs have young, black players that are exciting and marketable? I think that is more of an issue with academies and stuff, and not a perez thing.  the thing about the ronaldo image rights is kinda stupid. the only way to keep ronaldo was to give him his image rights. then he sold them to valencia's owner, but i dont think that the owner can use that money without violating financial fairplay. i believe the money has to come from the club's profits from ticket sales, merchandise, tv money, and tournament winnings.  I don't think the casillas saga will affect florentino having to leave. considering the profit being at an all time high, unless something crazy happens i don't think that there is going to be a change in the presidency. its a business, and end numbers are important.  overall i think this just reeks of someone who is upset about the way things went down. he says some things that don't make sense. if hierro was so upset that he left, then why is he back on the staff? wouldn't he not want to be associated with the club anymore? I think perez doesn't lie 24/7, thats ridiculous. Del Bosque was a mistake, i'll admit that, but complaining about the sale of higuain and Di maria is stupid. Higuain was obviously good, but Benzema has been very good these past two seasons, and was a large part for the trophies we have won. i don't know what the problem is with that. Di Maria wanted to get paid like a superstar for having half a good season. why wouldn't we take 60 mil?  idk, i just think the anger is misplaced."
realmadrid,3dunlr,ISCOREDwithISCO,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:06:11 2015 UTC,"I'd love to bring Zouma and Pogba to the club. That French connection with Varane, Zouma, Pogba and Benzema. However Pogba isn't likely and I think we'd be too stacked with him."
realmadrid,3dunlr,GiantsRTheBest2,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:21:24 2015 UTC,The problem with Pogba is that he is an exceptional player playing in a big club which means we will have to overpay which would upset an already star studded midfield. If we wouldn't have had Kroos or Modric then we would've had either Pogba or Veratti a while ago.
realmadrid,3dunlr,hotshotx988,2,Mon Jul 20 13:04:14 2015 UTC,"Iker never fights his own battles publicly, he always has someone saying what's on his mind without him having to say anything so he can stay ""a saint"". That's probably one of the reasons I'm glad he's gone is because he sabotages things that don't go his way but you never can prove it's him. We all remember when Sara came on national tv and called Perez and the club liars. We remember not so long ago when his parents came out and bad mouthed the club. And now we have this gem.  What he's saying makes absolutely no sense. Let's say Iker was forced out? He CHOSE PORTO. Nobody told him to accept offers or even consider them.  This guy then says Iker never asked to be a first choice goalkeeper and then says Iker left because Benetiz was praising Navas and De Gea? Do you see the contradiction?!  I do believe Iker wanted to stay here for life. It would have made a great story and it would have also guaranteed him 6m for 2 more years (he only agreed to leave because we would pay him his 6m). He wasn't forced out as in we forced him out, he wouldn't settle for less than a starting positition but he lost all leverage over the club and media after his catostrophic season last year so he wouldn't be able to force himself on the team anymore. That's why he listened to offers and finally accepted the Porto one.  What Iker is basically saying is Iker sat down and listened to Perez lie and lie about everything and sat down and took it. That sounds like something a coward would do, not a saint."
realmadrid,3dunlr,LosBlancosSR4,4,Tue Jul 21 09:25:55 2015 UTC,"Some of this stuff definitely makes sense, particularly about how Perez has too much control with the club. All of us have been saying that Carlo was forced to start Bale simply because Perez wanted him to, and this just reinforces that. However, overall, many of the points this guy makes seem exaggerated or just made up, as if all he wants to do is hurt Perez's reputation"

My heart is all the more sore seeing someone else in the shirt, but I really believe that great things may yet come with Navas.    In terms of the game, you could tell the players are quite rusty, especially in the back.  This is what preseason's for, though, so here's to more promising displays in the future!"

realmadrid,3dqq3e,RealMadrizzle,55,Sat Jul 18 20:52:23 2015 UTC,"Everyone just ignores Benzema as if we can just dump him. He's a top 3 striker in the world, we need him on the pitch. Also, Bale-Ronaldo up front has never worked before because they both have a similar skill set and similar weaknesses. So it's easier for the opponent to shut them down (just don't give them space)"
realmadrid,3dqq3e,LosBlancosSR4,30,Sat Jul 18 17:24:51 2015 UTC,"Fucking hell, you are spot on.  People are really ignoring how ridiculously talented Karim really is.  The man is practically made of goals and assists and is among the best performers under pressure I have seen."
realmadrid,3dqq3e,Commandophile,12,Sat Jul 18 19:01:47 2015 UTC,and his hold-up play is among the best in the world. that man could hold the ball for ages if need be.
realmadrid,3dqq3e,this-username,2,Sat Jul 18 20:25:46 2015 UTC,"I only remember one thing, over the course of 4 halfs against Juventus, we only played ONE like what we are, and it was when Benzema was playing, i still want to ask Carlo what the hell he was thinking not atarting Chicharito and letting Benzema in in the last 30min to wreck shit."

realmadrid,3dqq3e,LosBlancosSR4,0,Tue Jul 21 07:18:35 2015 UTC,"Suarez, Lewandoski, Aguero are the top 3 best in the world."
realmadrid,3dqq3e,AdamNJH,2,Sun Jul 19 07:04:37 2015 UTC,"It's a matter of opinion, but I think Benz is better than Lewan. Not only can he score and assist, but Benz can also holdup play really well. Also, Benz has to play with Ronaldo, which means that no matter what, he won't have as many chances to score because Ronaldo is usually the main target man"
realmadrid,3dqq3e,LosBlancosSR4,6,Sun Jul 19 07:36:25 2015 UTC,Lewa is one of the best hold up players in the world if not better than Benz. From a neutral view I think lewa is more lethal overall.

realmadrid,3dqq3e,LosBlancosSR4,9,Sun Jul 19 07:43:20 2015 UTC,"I remember we've tried him as a false 9 and it never really clicked. I also remember we started the first season under ancelotti with him as our number 10 in a 4231 and he played great. However, the team didn't and we switched to a 433"
realmadrid,3dqq3e,NickyRibs,2,Sat Jul 18 15:24:27 2015 UTC,"Yea i remember, he was our top scorer for the first few weeks"
realmadrid,3dqq3e,MadeInMadrid,32,Sat Jul 18 16:13:47 2015 UTC,Why would we play James so deep? we would be wasting him and he's better than Isco as a #10.
realmadrid,3dqq3e,fjperez12,2,Sat Jul 18 17:22:21 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say he is better. I would say he is different. It depends on what you want. Direct, quick passes and a little more scoring or creative dribbling to open up space for teammates and creative passing. I think in Rafa's preferred formation James would be better out on the right and Isco at the ten. James seems to do a lot of his damage coming from the right anyway. We will see what Rafa decides though."
realmadrid,3dqq3e,MadeInMadrid,4,Mon Jul 20 15:38:27 2015 UTC,James is the better player overall. Isco dribbles when unnecessary and can slow down the game by holding into the ball
realmadrid,3dqq3e,fjperez12,-1,Mon Jul 20 15:49:26 2015 UTC,"I really don't think his dribbles are unnecessary. He may lose the ball more, but it's because he takes on more players on. Just depends on what you prefer I guess."
realmadrid,3dqq3e,MadeInMadrid,2,Mon Jul 20 16:16:48 2015 UTC,"It's unnecessary most of the time. He doesn't need to take more players most of the time, look at James without taking as many players how many assists and goal he had this season and Isco played more than him."
realmadrid,3dqq3e,fjperez12,0,Mon Jul 20 16:24:13 2015 UTC,"If teams are going to sit back against us then I would rather have someone take players on. That is the most effective way you can unlock teams like that. Like I said, I think they are both great players who have different strengths. I do not think one is better than the other."
realmadrid,3dqq3e,MadeInMadrid,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:05:13 2015 UTC,"I disagree and I don't think it's even close between them. James is better from set pieces, crossing, finishing. They're both good at holding the ball and passing. He has shown up more times against stronger opposition than Isco. He's also more consistent. Look at the games we played when James was injured how we were resorting to mindlessly crossing. Isco is a better dribbler, but he slows our game down often and taking players when unnecessary and as a result he loses more balls"
realmadrid,3dqq3e,bozz14,6,Mon Jul 20 17:28:36 2015 UTC,"I think this could be solid offensively but I'm not a fan of the lack of width and it being defensively susceptible. Also not a fan of dropping Benz at all. I love Isco and I want to see him play as much as possible, but I think Rafa's main goal should be shoring up the defense instead of trying to fit in as many offensive players as possible. The goals will likely come no matter what, they need to work harder on not conceding them."
realmadrid,3dqq3e,FluidMechanics77,11,Sat Jul 18 16:07:31 2015 UTC,I would put Benzema over Bale in my opinion.
realmadrid,3dqq3e,Bustamente20,3,Sat Jul 18 19:46:19 2015 UTC,"I think Benitez is maximizing the potential of the squad by putting Bale in the number 10. At this position he can give and receive passes in a manner that forces him to do a little less work to get a chance (less dribbling). His speed will make him lethal in these kind of movements (saw it in the preseason game already).  Maximizing Bale's scoring should be one of the manager's top priorities. Ronaldo will get his goals and will continue to combine well with Marcelo on the left.  Positioned as a #10 Bale's pace allows him to backtrack well from help defensively in the midfield and hopefully Bale will be able to combine well with them and distribute to the wings. His greatest challenge will be maximizing his efficiency with passing. Kroos and Modric make a great midfield pairing. James can play on the right midfield defensively and support the striker/play on the wing defensively while Danilo provides additional pace on the Right.   This will be the lineup most capable of producing goals, consitently from Bale, Benzema, James, Ronaldo with genuine contribution from Kroos, Modric and the Fullbacks. It's hard to find a place for Isco in this lineup"
realmadrid,3dqq3e,mitchcrump1,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:35:23 2015 UTC,You say Isco wasn't positioned deep enough but you want to move him up to the highest position he is capable of playing...

realmadrid,3dq80y,bartolmai,3,Sat Jul 18 15:07:14 2015 UTC,"Posted this in another comment.  Some great penalties by both teams. Thought Roma played much better than us in the 1st half and Gervinho was a monster (and Falque). We were better in the 2nd half though. My take on the match overall: Ronaldo looked really rusty with some bad touches and decisions but it's pre season I guess (for some reason we didn't pass the ball to him that much). Odegaard looked afraid. Bale was okay because he made 2 or 3 good passes and looked sharp and tried to go past Cole and Maicon. Jese didn't do much and the attack had no creativity and fluidity. Bale is not creative enough to play behind the striker imo. Will have to see in the next few weeks. Navas, Isco (this kid is a magician), Varane and Kroos were the best players today. Roma played a good game overall so well done to them."
realmadrid,3dq80y,SuperBond,1 point,Sat Jul 18 11:37:04 2015 UTC,"Its just a friendly where various formations , positional importance and potential assessment will be done. Judging from the game we're still the same like our last season in terms of our final 3rd gameplay , the illara-odegaard-luka midfield was subdued and incongruous. Defense was shaky but you would expect that after break from football for about 2 months you come up against a Champions League side. Nevertheless , Jese & Isco were impressive here. Don't read too much into this game , its just accessment phase."
realmadrid,3dq80y,FractalNous7,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:31:17 2015 UTC,"I get it Real Madrid fans are overly critical and super quick to jump to conclusions if we do not win, or if we do not win by large margins. I do admit that I am upset with this result mainly because I wanted to see goals. The way we lost was not bad. Roma are a good team and we played well for it being the first match of preseason but I do wish I could have seen goals. All in all it wasn't that bad of a result, yes it sucks to see us lose but ""its preseason.""   Also, the same people who are saying ""Oh don't worry about the result it's only preseason"" are generally the ones that are super excited when we win preseason matches and stupid preseason competitions."

realmadrid,3dpi0y,gilezy,0,Sat Jul 18 20:18:02 2015 UTC,"Same old Bale. It's like if he just does sprints and practices free kicks.  Ronaldo looks great on the wing, but rust is evident.  Keylor. I hope he proves he's good enough to play/start. A bit shaky today.  Illarra looks solid. He's almost always solid, just wasn't ever given consistent time on games.  It's pre-season, the team looks good, no major injuries, and I'm just happy to be able to watch these guys again.  Hell of a season in store."

realmadrid,3dpi0y,MichStAlumnus14,0,Sat Jul 18 09:35:21 2015 UTC,Jese has been playing poor so far. Positioning isnt good enough
realmadrid,3dpi0y,indiananl,4,Sat Jul 18 09:19:44 2015 UTC,Really? I thought he's had a couple of beautiful passes so far.
realmadrid,3dpi0y,moklboy,-5,Sat Jul 18 09:35:54 2015 UTC,Think Benitez has stood more at the edge of his coaching box these first 20 minutes than Ancelotti has in his entire time at Real Madrid.
realmadrid,3dpi0y,TheGogoy,3,Sat Jul 18 09:22:41 2015 UTC,Bullshit.
realmadrid,3dpi0y,cronane,-9,Sat Jul 18 09:44:06 2015 UTC,Odegaard is not ready. Bale is going to thrive this season and it might Ronaldos last season next year.
realmadrid,3dpi0y,TheGogoy,12,Sat Jul 18 09:47:43 2015 UTC,And you come to that conclusion after 45 minutes of pre-season? Okay...
realmadrid,3dp7i4,nunixnunix04,12,Sat Jul 18 03:09:21 2015 UTC,This stat doesn't mean much. If he had more shots registered against him because of a poorer back line then of course he would make more saves than those keeper who sometimes only make a few saves per game.
realmadrid,3dp7i4,theWishingtroll,5,Sat Jul 18 06:21:02 2015 UTC,"How many shots flew at him? How many of said shots were goals and many were saves? I've seen Kiko play. He's not bad, but this doesn't mean much. Could mean that he's average and Espanyol's defense is shit (I didn't watch too many Espanyol games last season so I don't know), so he has a high number of shots flying at him. I hope he does well in Madrid this coming season though."
realmadrid,3dp7i4,BlackDante,3,Sat Jul 18 05:09:24 2015 UTC,Every career mode i play on FIFA Real sign this guy.
realmadrid,3dp7i4,goraj123,3,Sat Jul 18 05:22:58 2015 UTC,Real would sign either Aguero or Lloris in my career.
realmadrid,3dp7i4,TonyCruise,3,Sat Jul 18 06:11:14 2015 UTC,"I hardly know him, but I like the fact that he's tall and should be able to deal better with balls flying around in the box, which has been kind of a problem with all our latest keepers"
realmadrid,3dp7i4,barbenatiya,3,Sat Jul 18 06:06:13 2015 UTC,"I see almost all league matches, Kiko has given RM a big fucking hard time. At least, when playing against RM, he has saved the impossible many times."

realmadrid,3dp7i4,GiantsRTheBest2,2,Mon Jul 20 05:41:04 2015 UTC,"and Navas was GK of the season for La Liga before the World Cup but he hasn't really shown us what he's got. Kiko also cost Spain their friendly against Germany earlier this year. Ironically, Casillas was subbed off for Kiko and Kroos scored the winner at the 88th min.

realmadrid,3dp7lr,jmartinez042899,12,Sat Jul 18 07:51:04 2015 UTC,el classico at the Bernabeu 3-1
realmadrid,3dp7lr,concernedsponge,5,Sat Jul 18 03:28:02 2015 UTC,We dominated that match.
realmadrid,3dp7lr,KeiserSoze24,8,Sat Jul 18 14:49:05 2015 UTC,"Real Madrid 1-0 Atlético in Champions League. After them frustrating us so much during the season, it felt really good to win in the biggest competition that we are both in."
realmadrid,3dp7lr,NO_NAMES_LEFT_ARRG,4,Sat Jul 18 06:14:12 2015 UTC,"Aside from the big rivalries. My favorite game this season was away at Sevilla. Such a high pressure game, and it was so exciting!  Ronaldo's third goal is one of my all time favorites. One might argue the greatest header of all time."
realmadrid,3dp7lr,golferdudeag,3,Sun Jul 19 03:28:18 2015 UTC,"What a header, totally unstoppable."
realmadrid,3dp7lr,ddrt,2,Sun Jul 19 04:44:56 2015 UTC,Wow! And bale's ability to cross field pinpoint him in an instant with incredible accuracy. Wow.
realmadrid,3dp7lr,Commandophile,2,Sun Jul 19 20:42:12 2015 UTC,"I damn near soiled myself when that happened.  Far post, falling away from goal, and a perfect chip over an outstretched keeper. Couldn't even imagine a more perfect headed goal if I tried."

realmadrid,3dp7lr,Murrderer,2,Sat Jul 18 17:58:34 2015 UTC,"In terms of dominance: The Clasico at the Bernabeu and the 3-0 vs Liverpool at Anfield both have to be up there. And those La Liga Demolitions such as the 9-3 and 7-2.  In terms of excitement: The 2nd leg QF Atleti Derby, exactly the type of stuff which keeps you on your seat."

realmadrid,3dmbe3,lee-o,27,Fri Jul 17 12:51:26 2015 UTC,"Good good, looking forward to have Navas and Casilla duke it out for the starting position, they will make each other better."
realmadrid,3dmbe3,metroddity,12,Fri Jul 17 13:25:34 2015 UTC,"Agreed. It's Navas' job to lose, but I wouldn't rule out Casilla. He is an excellent keeper."
realmadrid,3dmbe3,fjperez12,16,Fri Jul 17 14:50:24 2015 UTC,Hopefully Navas has a great season.
realmadrid,3dmbe3,bxbomber,7,Fri Jul 17 13:13:49 2015 UTC,I want to see navas cement himself as our everyday keeper. He deserves a real shot and I think he can surprise a lot of people. He's class.
realmadrid,3dmbe3,KeiserSoze24,-1,Fri Jul 17 20:19:17 2015 UTC,"He's not that good. He deserves to be the starting keeper for a good team, but not a great team like Madrid. He's just not good enough to be our #1. He's good enough to be a solid backup keeper (if he felt like sticking to that role, although he's obviously better than that) and he's good enough to be a temporary solution until we fix our situation. He's also good enough to be the #1 for a team like Napoli or something like that. Nothing more."
realmadrid,3dmbe3,hadesflames,15,Sat Jul 18 10:04:05 2015 UTC,"I'm a little surprised... I've seen a few Espanyol matches, and I've never thought of Casilla as a great keeper. He's never impressed for the national team when he has had the chance to play, either. But he seems so happy to be back at Madrid, so I wish him the best. It'll be really interesting to see who Benítez chooses - him or Navas."
realmadrid,3dmbe3,pale_cerulean_dot,14,Fri Jul 17 13:57:49 2015 UTC,"I've also seen him play, he is really good"
realmadrid,3dmbe3,risjinalosnvai,7,Fri Jul 17 14:02:35 2015 UTC,"If it were me, it would be Navas all the way. Casilla is good in the air and is by no means terrible, but he's prone to some of the most baffling mistakes you'll ever see. Still, a very solid backup option."
realmadrid,3dmbe3,bozz14,4,Fri Jul 17 14:26:56 2015 UTC,"He is a very solid backup for Navas, able to challenge him for the spot. Casilla was one of the better keepers last season, and what is also important, returning to us was always his dream, he stated that multiple times."
realmadrid,3dmbe3,TetraDax,2,Fri Jul 17 14:41:19 2015 UTC,"He's definitely a very good keeper, not De Gea level but definitely on par with Navas. And who knows, maybe the jump to a larger team will make him perform even better."
realmadrid,3dmbe3,Foxtrot68W,2,Fri Jul 17 16:06:06 2015 UTC,"I think Rafa has already said that Navas would be the number 1 ""at the moment""."
realmadrid,3dmbe3,The_Unarmed_Doctor,6,Fri Jul 17 22:01:05 2015 UTC,Great Signing. I am very excited and looking forward to this season. Hala Madrid!
realmadrid,3dmbe3,TKMania,14,Fri Jul 17 14:22:10 2015 UTC,"I like this, even more than signing David de Gea. That would have meant a second season as 2. for Keylor. Now he has chance to show Bernabeu what he is made of"
realmadrid,3dmbe3,bartolmai,2,Fri Jul 17 14:39:46 2015 UTC,"But De Gea would have been THE keeper for Real Madrid, likely for the next 10 or more years."
realmadrid,3dmbe3,d0m1n4t0r,4,Fri Jul 17 20:04:25 2015 UTC,De Gea will be a Madrid player next summer.

realmadrid,3dmbe3,d0m1n4t0r,4,Sat Jul 18 02:29:53 2015 UTC,Didn't he give us a huge headache two seasons ago in the Copa?
realmadrid,3dmbe3,noobslayer007,4,Fri Jul 17 16:06:06 2015 UTC,Navas V's Casilla will be an interesting battle all year!  IMO they are pretty equal. Hopefully they push each other to new levels.  I currently favor Casilla over Navas...
realmadrid,3dmbe3,tefftlon,5,Fri Jul 17 17:12:00 2015 UTC,Will he be our second GK and will it mean we won't get DDG this transfer window?
realmadrid,3dmbe3,kaspar737,20,Fri Jul 17 13:54:19 2015 UTC,Nah fuck Ed Woodward he wants to play hardball? Okay we will just wait it out
realmadrid,3dmbe3,GiantsRTheBest2,8,Fri Jul 17 14:27:40 2015 UTC,I doubt it now. We can get him for free next summer and we have two very capable keepers.
realmadrid,3dmbe3,fjperez12,3,Fri Jul 17 14:52:01 2015 UTC,There's still time for more transfers to happen.  Also if DDG comes it would mean that Navas most likely leaves which means another keeper would be needed regardless  Edit: rewording.
realmadrid,3dmbe3,DeletoiD,2,Fri Jul 17 14:46:28 2015 UTC,Why would another keeper be needed if DDG comes?
realmadrid,3dmbe3,bozz14,2,Fri Jul 17 15:13:12 2015 UTC,Talked about a situation in which we hadn't gotten Casilla. I wrote it badly.  It's either Navas or De Gea. Not both.
realmadrid,3dmbe3,DeletoiD,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:43:42 2015 UTC,Next summer for free.
realmadrid,3dmbe3,goraj123,2,Sat Jul 18 05:24:05 2015 UTC,It seems as though the galactico mentality of dying down. The club seems to be getting some bargain players and focusing on the youth more. But do you guys think we got a good deal here? We paid much less for Casilla but is he better than casillas/good enough to be a starter at Real Madrid/or worth the cheap price in relation to de Gea. Just curious as once again I'm still a relatively new follower and don't know much about our new keeper. Nonetheless I'm happy we found a replacement and from what you guys say we got a decent keeper for a good price.
realmadrid,3dmbe3,theWishingtroll,4,Fri Jul 17 19:51:52 2015 UTC,"I don't want to sound unpopular but despite the good seasons with Espanyol and Levante IMHO both Kiko and Keylor are not so good to be the first keeper for one of the best team in the world. I believe Kiko (that came from our youth system, it means a lot for UEFA rules) will be the second choice after De Gea (we'll eventually buy him in August, just let Man Utd find a replacement) and Navas will leave since he deserves a spot somewhere as first choice."
realmadrid,3dmbe3,KnoxOut,7,Fri Jul 17 15:01:55 2015 UTC,In his limited time last year Navas failed to impress me. Hopefully with consistent time he is able to play at a higher level.
realmadrid,3dmbe3,ChedduhBob,3,Fri Jul 17 15:21:11 2015 UTC,"I completely agree, unfortunately, but I would love for us to be proven wrong."
realmadrid,3dmbe3,pale_cerulean_dot,3,Fri Jul 17 22:12:35 2015 UTC,"Agree on the first part, disagree on the second one, De Gea won't come 'till next year, and that sucks."
realmadrid,3dmbe3,san767,-1,Fri Jul 17 16:43:10 2015 UTC,"I don't think we're signing DDG this season, because Man U is asking for too much. There is no point in overpaying since we can get him for free next year, unless he changes his mind and wants to stay at Man U, in which case screw him. Navas is an excellent keeper, and I have faith that he will perform well this season"
realmadrid,3dmbe3,LosBlancosSR4,-2,Fri Jul 17 17:33:53 2015 UTC,"I don't know. Perez may have just called United's bluff with this signing and perhaps we'll see United come in with a lower demand. €6m isn't a lot for RM to pay and is worth it if it saves one cent over 6m on DDG. The standard United line is that they don't need the money and won't sell him, but it is a business in the end and they need to consider getting something for him."
realmadrid,3dmbe3,ReggieBlankenship,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:54:52 2015 UTC,Casilla is good and is the type of player to get better. Competition for Navas. Great to have behind De Gea as well.
realmadrid,3dmbe3,pizzaphil,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:59:45 2015 UTC,"It's okay, we'll wait a year for De Gea rather than give Utd. any money. The competitiveness between Navas and Casilla should be interesting in the meantime."

realmadrid,3dm58n,JamaicanBoySmith,2,Fri Jul 17 11:41:18 2015 UTC,Anyone who seen the kid play knows that he has a magical touch. His ball control is outstanding and many times he dribbles past defenders with precision dribbling. He's only getting better. We need to make room for him because he is awesome and will be great in no time.
realmadrid,3dm58n,KeiserSoze24,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:49:39 2015 UTC,These new balls are so fucking ugly.
realmadrid,3dm58n,Bigswole92,3,Fri Jul 17 19:38:38 2015 UTC,I think they are dope!
realmadrid,3dn1n3,joevaded,23,Fri Jul 17 16:31:08 2015 UTC,Jordi Alba is just insufferable. He says he shouldn't speak about other clubs and then promptly proceeds to spout nonsense. For fuck's sake man
realmadrid,3dn1n3,SoHipsterItHurts,15,Fri Jul 17 20:42:36 2015 UTC,"Now now, everyone at Barca is a saint. That club is perfect."
realmadrid,3dn1n3,golferdudeag,2,Fri Jul 17 21:31:18 2015 UTC,"He's a twat, don't beat around the bush"
realmadrid,3dn1n3,RealMadrizzle,5,Sat Jul 18 13:03:40 2015 UTC,"There is a huge difference between Xavi's farewell and Iker's farewell.  Xavi's decided to leave the club before the season ended which gave an opportunity for the Barcelona management to give him a proper farewell. While Iker's farewell came in the middle of the transfer season, literally days before the club set off to their Australia bootcamp.  I am 100% sure that Iker would have gotten an amazing farewell from the club and its fans if he left the club during the season."
realmadrid,3dn1n3,ace-s,7,Fri Jul 17 21:04:21 2015 UTC,"He never said ""a better farewell."" He said the farewell would have been done differently. Not sure what's so funny."
realmadrid,3dn1n3,HippoNigga,-16,Fri Jul 17 19:27:03 2015 UTC,Nope. You are pulling it out of context. He mentioned three things:   Iker is respected Xavi perhaps got a more positive send off because of the triplete while with Iker not so much because of the loss of cups Barca would have done it differently.   Differently how? With Catalan text on banners? A ferris wheel?  It's obvious as to what he is implying. Saying otherwise is a gross intent of feigning ignorance.
realmadrid,3dn1n3,HippoNigga,5,Fri Jul 17 22:56:43 2015 UTC,"But you're putting it in quotation marks like if those were his exact words... but they weren't. Doesn't matter what he was implying, he did not say those words thus they shouldn't be in quotations."
realmadrid,3dn1n3,dabumtsss,-13,Fri Jul 17 23:02:37 2015 UTC,"You're right about the quotes but you are trying to downplay what he said as if it were nothing.   He never said ""a better farewell."" He said the farewell would have been done differently. Not sure what's so funny."
realmadrid,3dn1n3,FluidMechanics77,4,Fri Jul 17 23:47:56 2015 UTC,"I'm sure Madrid could have followed Barca's example with Valdes, Eto'o, Ronaldinho, etc.  We are thinking of having a ""so ridiculous it's funny thread"" every day or once a week (maybe a ""What's the most idiotic thing you read this week?"") due to the offseason going in full force, what do you guys think?"
realmadrid,3dn1n3,dabumtsss,13,Fri Jul 17 16:32:49 2015 UTC,"I'd love it. Can we post /r/soccer comments, or is that cheating?"

realmadrid,3dn1n3,brazenrumraisin,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:57:16 2015 UTC,It's been a Manure circlejerk in r/soccer this summer. It's like they're the first club ever to deny Real Madrid from purchasing a player.

realmadrid,3dn1n3,bozz14,2,Fri Jul 17 18:12:52 2015 UTC,"He's kind of right although I hate to say it...if someone had put in that amount of time and won that many titles at Barca, they would have gotten a seriously decent send off."
realmadrid,3dn1n3,brazenrumraisin,16,Fri Jul 17 17:03:35 2015 UTC,"Reports said Casillas refused a big send off. We're Madrid, giving him the biggest send off would have no strain on our part if he asked for it."
realmadrid,3dn1n3,bozz14,-7,Fri Jul 17 17:25:47 2015 UTC,"Reports said    Nobody asks for a big goodbye, can you imagine ""yes, I want a huge parade through the streets"" haha. Barca bloody love a goodbye party is all, they are much better at things like that than we are, on a big or smaller more subtle scale, hate to say it, but they are better at that kind of stuff than we are."
realmadrid,3dn1n3,brazenrumraisin,0,Fri Jul 17 17:33:07 2015 UTC,"Here's a question, do you think the club knew months ago that he'd be leaving? I have a feeling if he told them say, in April or something, that he'd look to leave then perhaps they would've arranged a tribute in the last league match. It just seemed like this whole thing was rushed past the point of coordinating a big sendoff during the season. That's why I think it's unfair to Xavi as most people knew last summer that this was going to be the end for him at Barca."
realmadrid,3dn1n3,CrAppyF33ling,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:40:46 2015 UTC,"This has been a long time coming and they may well have known he was going somewhere, but yes, the timing of this has impacted the whole saying goodbye things hugely. Regardless, they still would have done a better job haha, bloody nicey nice Barca and their bloody parties. Their bus driver got a better send off than Iker did."
realmadrid,3dn1n3,golferdudeag,0,Fri Jul 17 17:47:20 2015 UTC,"Well sure, the end of his career was lot nearer than the beginning. But did they know it would happen this summer as opposed to next perhaps? I'm not so sure. This club has done some cold things over the years but I just cannot believe that they know well in advance that he'd be leaving now and still chose to not plan anything. If they were willingly okay with taking that PR hit then that's a new level of stupid."
realmadrid,3dn1n3,Kingofzion,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:56:26 2015 UTC,"Who knows, we have no idea how good or awful things could have been between him and the club i recent months, I guess we'll never know. No PR hit if nobody finds out haha, but it doesn't really matter now does it, he's gone :("
realmadrid,3dn1n3,brazenrumraisin,-12,Fri Jul 17 18:13:24 2015 UTC,"You're right. They didn't. Iker kept saying his objective was to stay, DDG was thrown around by Madrid staff and Iker himself...  It looks as if something happened where perfects Iker's minutes were threatened or perhaps he didn't want to concede to Navas his spot as much as he was with DDG... who knows!  But what is true is that something changed and Iker decided during the offseason to leave - hence the TB Cup send off."
realmadrid,3dn1n3,golferdudeag,-1,Fri Jul 17 22:50:25 2015 UTC,"Sorry, poor choice of words. That's not what I intended. The reports said that he refused a big goodbye and only wanted a press conference. But as I said, if it's like Casillas, we would have given him one if he asked or not, but he wanted a press conference."
realmadrid,3dn1n3,KevinQ2,3,Fri Jul 17 17:36:28 2015 UTC,Really dude? Provide some examples. You're only comparing Xavi and Casillas. Farewells don't get organized overnight. Iker only left one week ago and I'm not sure what you're expecting to happen so quickly. Xavi's retirement was in speculation the entire year and Barca still took time to put together a ceremony once things were announced.  Perez has already announced that there will be a cup to honor Casillas with Porto. People also seem to be forgetting how we said farewell to Raul. And /u/joevaded already shed light on the Barcelona's not so publicized fairwells.
realmadrid,3dn1n3,brazenrumraisin,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:01:28 2015 UTC,Let's not forget how he said farewell to us.
realmadrid,3dn1n3,brazenrumraisin,0,Sat Jul 18 02:04:00 2015 UTC,"Where did I say Xavis name? All I was saying was I think the whole thing could have been handled better/nicer. It's a discussion about leaving parties, don't take it so seriously."
realmadrid,3dn1n3,brazenrumraisin,2,Fri Jul 17 19:10:34 2015 UTC,"You're coming in to a Real Madrid thread, saying Barca is better, asking us to take your word for it, and then pulling out the ""calma, calma"" and ""don't take it so seriously""? You're something else man.   Anyway, it'd be great if you could support your claims rather than just ask us to take them at face value. From what it sounds like, you're taking the media's take on this too seriously. Casillas is going to be getting a proper fairwell. That's straight from Perez. Not sure what more you want."
realmadrid,3dn1n3,KeiserSoze24,-4,Fri Jul 17 20:25:48 2015 UTC,Dude.... DUDDEEEE.... IT IS BEING HANDLED AS WE Speak.   It's not over. It happened in the off-season. Iker is getting a cup game just for him.

It just doesn't have an appeal of a superhero I'd want to watch. Should I read up on Ant-man lore beforehand or does the movie do a good job of explaining him as a character? I ask because let's be honest... Ultron was kind of a let down. He was awesome in the trailer parts, but confusing and dissapointing  in the movie. Scarlet witch and Quicksilver were more entertaining to watch."
realmadrid,3dm3vh,nitrosGG,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:04:42 2015 UTC,"I liked Age of Ultron, but I found it pretty underwhelming after so many quality Marvel films before it (particularly when GotG, my favorite, was still pretty recent). I enjoyed Ant-Man a lot more! It's just really fun, hilarious, and while it does fit into the MCU, it also works as a great standalone film. I've never read any Ant-Man books and didn't really feel any particular draw to the character before, but I didn't feel lost and if anything it made me want to check out the recent runs.  Also: stay until the very very end.  Oh and Comixology has a sale on Ant-Man comics right now."

Guardians of the Galaxy has been the best by a massive margin and I didn't think it was fantastic or anything.  I'm looking forward to villains that are actually good too. Fucking marvel villains are all the same. Just an evil version of the main character.

Whereas Fate series was created for adults so there's just a bunch of more adulty themes for it. The plot, not as convoluted, but it is dark and have conversations about idealism and things like that that makes you think a bit more. Definitely more of a grey area type anime instead of straight up light vs dark that is the Elrics vs Homunculus. But still man, FMA is one hell of an anime."

The hardcore fate fans will get butthurt, but I think it will make you understand better.  Fate/zero is much more action based and it gets going quicker. Plus the fights seem a little bigger in scale to me since some of the other champions are more interesting.  Ubw starts with kinda a slice of life feel that focuses on Rin and Shirou, then builds up to some crazy action. The animation on the fights at the end is honestly jaw dropping"
realmadrid,3dm3vh,ChedduhBob,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:34:44 2015 UTC,"Mmm. I think watching it straight up is fine, the story is supposed to be like that anyways since zero was created afterwards. However, any order works."

realmadrid,3dl4u2,senorPerez,1 point,Fri Jul 17 09:01:35 2015 UTC,"I've heard Benitez will deploy Ronaldo as striker, so unless Benzema leaves, will Jese be 3rd in the pecking order for a striker in a 4231 system? Or will Benzema play in another position (attacking mid) so Jese can be second striker? Or will Ronaldo not play striker at all and stay mostly as winger?"
realmadrid,3dn1cb,Negrodamus06,10,Fri Jul 17 16:29:03 2015 UTC,"That depends. Can Casemiro, Illara, or Lucas Silva step up and play the defensive midfielder role when needed? If yes, then all we need is a backup striker. However, if neither of the three can elevate their game, then we desperately need to address the DM issue. Otherwise, we are one Luca Modric injury away from another trophyless season."

realmadrid,3dn1cb,chilango2,2,Fri Jul 17 17:56:52 2015 UTC,"With the line up Benitez is planning, that would be Jesé."
realmadrid,3dn1cb,BlancaRM,0,Sat Jul 18 02:22:30 2015 UTC,A.K.A. they need to sign another striker.
realmadrid,3dn1cb,Brancavs,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:11:02 2015 UTC,"I trust him. He was doing great before the injury, and after that he didn't get much minutes to play, so I hope I can see more of him this season. It's more important to get replacements for the weaknesses on the defense I believe."

realmadrid,3dn1cb,RRRmadrista,2,Fri Jul 17 16:51:36 2015 UTC,At least after the two next games. This will give Benitez a clear idea where the squad will need to be consolidated
realmadrid,3dn1cb,bozz14,3,Fri Jul 17 16:55:44 2015 UTC,I'm with you. The only position where a part of me would maybe like a change is Coentrao's spot. I like him and wish him well but I think a clean break for both parties would be mutually beneficial. The rest of the team is pretty set in my eyes. Lots of guys can overlap and play multiple roles.

realmadrid,3djpt6,DaveDeeone,6,Thu Jul 16 22:03:59 2015 UTC,"Florentino claimed that nobody wanted him to leave. I think it's safe to say that deep down Casillas didn't want to go either.  But the sad part of it is this; the relationship involving Casillas, the fans, and team (Florentino, etc.) was broken and unfixable.  Casillas ended up giving a farewell speech in a room with no one else but reporters. No heartfelt ceremony, no feel-good highlight reel, no proper goodbye.  And for those who claimed that he was tearing the club apart between supporters and those who wanted him gone, the situation is somewhat the same now. There's those that are happy he's gone and those that will stand by Iker until the end.  Fact of the matter is this; Iker loved this club more than anyone. He loved the glory and he accepted the booing even when it wasn't justified. Real Madrid is his blood, his home, his life, and all the over-exaggerated criticism and negativity drove him away."
realmadrid,3djpt6,jmartinez042899,2,Fri Jul 17 03:59:55 2015 UTC,I agree but I also think it's tough on the president and board to put emotion aside and do what they think is best for the club. And casillas as a player and a professional must do what he thinks is best for his career and I guess neither could come to an agreement
realmadrid,3djpt6,theWishingtroll,2,Fri Jul 17 07:18:57 2015 UTC,"I think something dramatic happened in the last few weeks. I for sure remember Iker saying in the past he'd never play for a club that could compete against Madrid.  But, he wasn't ready to ""retire"" and that's why he didn't go to the MLS. He still had it in him to keep going, and he thinks so himself. This hurts."

He knows what the implications a formation change could have on his scoring potential. Ronaldo has very strict preferences on where he wants to play and ever since Mourinho, these rules have been followed.  This time around, with all whats being said in the press following the training, we can infer that Ronaldo's prefered position might be in jeopardy in favor of giving Bale a more focal role."

realmadrid,3dek4y,FluidMechanics77,12,Wed Jul 15 17:41:04 2015 UTC,"Right?? I honestly felt like sometimes Ancelotti would just train then and then let them sort of ""do their thing"" in most matches. I'm excited for this upcoming season and to be honest, I know this isn't a popular opinion but I thought last season we were starting to become boring when we were transitioning from a counterattacking team into a possession based one.

realmadrid,3dek4y,GiantsRTheBest2,5,Wed Jul 15 22:37:40 2015 UTC,I read somewhere they wear these trackers during training to see their heart beat and where they are and they can monitor if you're over exerting while injured. Some probably wear it under their training jerseys and maybe some on the outside because it's uncomfortable. Now I don't know if that man bra is the tracker or the tracker is embedded in the shirt

This help Real Madrid pay the massive debt they had accumulated, which allowed them to pay for Los Galacticos. Florentino uses Real Madrid for personal benefits of his real estate developing company (ACS), and in turn he received favors from Bankia, the city council, etc... http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/european/state-aid-for-madrids-santiago-bernabeu-stadium-its-all-about-the-real-estate-8557549.html"

realmadrid,3dcawr,fjperez12,3,Wed Jul 15 03:50:24 2015 UTC,"I really hope you're wrong about Ronaldo playing as a forward. Benzema is crucial to this team he was the 3rd best forward in La Liga last season I think we'd want both of our best forwards to play together if possible.  And this might not be a great idea but I'd like to try it out before writing it off, try Kroos at CAM instead of Isco.  Also maybe it's just me but I'd like to see how Bale would do in Ronaldos position without Ronaldo playing, maybe have him play with people like Isco, Jese, Vazquez just to see how he and the rest of the team would do with Bale the center of attention."
realmadrid,3dcawr,shervinasayesh,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:24:18 2015 UTC,"I am sure Bale will get his chances while Ronaldo isn't playing this year because we all know Rafa isn't afraid to rest players.

realmadrid,3da0kl,_CM18,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:15:26 2015 UTC,"The website is kind of difficult to get to work for you. I was in Madrid this spring on the stadium tour, actually connected to their RealMadrid_Espectadores Wi-Fi network, and couldn't get the tickets ordered. I had to, after the tour, go to the ticket counter on the south side of stadium to pick up tickets for the game the next day against Villarreal. I think the website will keep buffering until is your queue but I was ""spinning"" for over an hour as I walked around. I'm afraid it's going to be more difficult for el Clasico. There are other websites you can securely use, but you will need to have somewhere around 900€ to make the purchase. Your other option is to camp out by the ticket counter (I think it is called: Taquilla). I think this is your best bet, but I imagine it's going to be a madhouse at the Bernabeu.   TLTY: Website difficult to get tickets from. Others are expensive. People will camp for tickets. El Clasico isn't just a game."
realmadrid,3da0kl,ickymicky_design,3,Wed Jul 15 17:17:51 2015 UTC,"Dang. I'm checking the official site everyday. Going to the stadium is not an option for me since I live in the United States and will be traveling there to watch the game, if I get tickets. Money isn't an issue since I've been saving up, but I'm hoping I get good seats for around $500-$600 USD. Cause I know on resale sites, that amount of money will probably only get me nosebleeds which I don't think will be worth the money cause I can get a better view on my TV at home. The same seats that will cost $500 on Real's website will probably go for $1500+ on viagogo, for example. I'm actually considering becoming an official Madridista just to increase my chances of getting tickets from the club. It's stressful..."

realmadrid,3d99g8,fjperez12,2,Tue Jul 14 18:33:13 2015 UTC,Not my first choice but at least he's a defensive midfielder.. Not sure that he's a big enough departure from Casemiro to warrant the ~20m they'll want for him

realmadrid,3d7xpu,Commandophile,4,Tue Jul 14 21:55:24 2015 UTC,"In fitness, soccer and I think in every other sport, an excess of muscle will actually make you slower. It is not the quality you want for a RW/LW where quick reactions and fast sprints are required. Muscle is needed for a physic position where strength plays a major rol, CB's and DM's comes to mind as well as some CF's.  It's a pro/con debate, however, muscular injuries happens more often in bodys with more muscle. Pretty self explanatory."
realmadrid,3d7xpu,Demmitri,2,Wed Jul 15 00:23:33 2015 UTC,"Also to add, more muscle requires more oxygen and thus you fatigue easily. That's why you see boxers, MMA fighters, Cyclists and Marathon athletes having really skinny body with really less muscles along with almost no fat. This helps in increasing your stamina."

realmadrid,3d7xpu,flifthyawesome,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:54:32 2015 UTC,"To add on to the answer you already got. There was a huge trend in the NBA this year where a lot of players lost significant amounts of weight for these reasons, avoiding injury in aging players especially was an important one. The extra weight on joints can increase the chance of injury. Lebron looked like a completely different person lol. Basically you hit diminishing returns with your muscle mass, and can even become detrimental. Could you imagine a bodybuilder trying to keep up in a pro futbol game?  I've been thinking all year that Ronaldo could stand to lose a bit of weight, the guy is full on terminator status."

realmadrid,3d7xpu,brazenrumraisin,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:38:40 2015 UTC,My face very time I think of his last game :'(  I want him to retire with us but I also want to see him play in person so I wouldn't be too upset if he decided to move to MLS
realmadrid,3d7xpu,Thor395,4,Tue Jul 14 14:51:31 2015 UTC,"God it'll be horrible, and you know he'll lose it and get so emotional which will just compound it. I want him to finish with us as well, but I fear he will leave us towards the end.   You can see him live dude, there are these wonderful things called planes these days! I'm sure we'll do a US tour at some point as well. You'll find your way to him somehow I'm sure haha. If it's meant to be it's meant to be :)"

realmadrid,3d7oqs,rishinator,2,Tue Jul 14 15:54:20 2015 UTC,Yeah I've been dissappointed in this whole transfer season for everyone. I honestly enjoy watching other massive transfers happen to other clubs in other leagues. Even if it's like PSG buying someone I still think it's cool. It's starting to look like no big ones will happen aside from that comically stupid man city purchase of sterling.

realmadrid,3d7oqs,dabumtsss,4,Tue Jul 14 04:50:57 2015 UTC,"Rap and electronic stuff like Blackmill, Big Gigantic, Pretty lights. Some pop, a little jazz, basically anything except country and screamo.  Yung Lean, Kanye, Gambino, Logic, JCole, have been the stuff I've listened to the most this summer  808s and heartbreaks, Camp, Under Pressure, MBDTF, 2014 Forest Hills Drive, and Graduation have been on repeat."
realmadrid,3d7oqs,ChedduhBob,2,Tue Jul 14 05:29:23 2015 UTC,"Yung lean is just meme rap u nerd   for real tho I just had 808s and heartbreaks on repeat all day when Casillas left. The way Kanye used autotune was fantastic, made him sound like a robot. (S/o to robocop)"
realmadrid,3d7oqs,dabumtsss,2,Tue Jul 14 05:35:43 2015 UTC,"I just care a lot about production and no matter what anyone has to say about lean, Yung Gud might be one of the best producers in the game. How You Like Me Now, Kyoto, and Yoshi City are unbelievable works of production. Plus Yung Lean says some shit every now and then that's fire lol  I actually feel the same way about Lil B. Some of his songs have crazy good beats even though the lyrics are intentionally retarded.  Another album I've been listening to a lot is Kauai by Gambino. Heavily influenced by 808s IMO, and the songs are really cool.  The last person that people always call me crazy for is Jaden Smith. He is actually a really good rapper as weird as he is. If he grows up a little bit more and his voice drops he'll be amazing. Look up Trophies by him and you'll see what I'm talking about."

I remember seeing something from Jaden a while ago on hhh that was actually pretty good.

realmadrid,3d7oqs,Foxtrot68W,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:30:25 2015 UTC,He'll get the exciting Llorente and Kiko Casilla combo and call it a summer.  Who do have in mind tho?
realmadrid,3d7oqs,CHRIS726,2,Thu Jul 16 18:47:22 2015 UTC,"A defensive midfielder, realistically I wanted Kondogbia but now Inter nabbed him, Vidal would have been nice too but Bayern nabbed him for cheap so I'm assuming Flo is gonna shell out a retarded price for some overrated center midfielder known for his qualities in attack and force him to convert to a defensive mid ala Kroos(not overrated). Or of course he buys a world class striker for somewhere in the 70-80 Mil range and he splits time with Benzema.   For me I'd really like like Jordan Henderson with good support qualities but solid defensive ability or the transfer of my dreams which would be Nemanja Matic."

realmadrid,3d5fvo,CrAppyF33ling,3,Mon Jul 13 17:59:28 2015 UTC,"For sure, 7 weeks is a long time and we usually make our big signing late in the summer. However, we usually start hearing about the signing earlier on in the summer, and then it drags out for a few weeks. With a new manager, maybe it would have been beneficial to sign players earlier in the summer, so that they could have a full preseason."

realmadrid,3d5fvo,CrAppyF33ling,2,Mon Jul 13 22:26:58 2015 UTC,"Yep, also think back to the Madrid-Napoli exchanges. One day they got Higuain, then Albiol, then Callejon. James took about a week since the rumors and negotiations took place while the World Cup was still happening. Same with Kroos."

realmadrid,3d5fvo,Alopolis,5,Mon Jul 13 18:06:52 2015 UTC,I think Rafa is going to test the starters because he will needs to decide on the right tactics for the team before the season starts
realmadrid,3d5fvo,ISCOREDwithISCO,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:11:21 2015 UTC,"This summer has been a relatively quiet summer with (only) the copper america going on. That means not many of our players will be on extended leave, so theoretically, a near full squad will be available.   Compare that to last year with the WC, we had players coming back at different times due to them ending their WC campaigns at different times. That meant that pre season was a lot more disjointed with players like James and Kroos only getting their first matches in the European Supercup."

I know GK and the backup striker are the more marquee roles, but something needs to be done at LB. If Coentrao is healthy and happy, great! However, how often can we count on that?  Only thing that worries me are the options on the market. I don't think Ricardo Rodriguez is coming so that leaves the likes of Willems and Rahman. Good players, but still in need of development."

Casemiro, Silva, and Illara might be able to cover for the defensive loss, but I don't know if they can offer any creativity in attack.

realmadrid,3d481r,ace-s,7,Mon Jul 13 12:10:01 2015 UTC,You mean you're worried how the 2014 best la liga goalkeeper is going to perform?
realmadrid,3d481r,inno_func,3,Mon Jul 13 12:59:02 2015 UTC,"ean you're worried how the 2014 best la liga goalkeeper is going to perform?   That is irrelevant. At one point someone said, ""Worried about how Michael Owen, Balon d'Or played?""  Keylor is a top GK. But being a top GK in a small club is a very distinct thing when you come to a big club. Some people can't shake the small club mentality. Some people can't adapt to a superstar team. Keylor deserves a chance but relying on him solely with a mediocre backup GK and a reserve GK is a poor plan.  When Illara came, he was incredible for La Rojita, he was easily one of the top midfielders for Sociedad that season. He almost single handedly anchored their mid and all the comparisons to the next Alonso came to be.  PLAYING IN A SMALL TEAM vs. PLAYING A TOP 3 TEAM IS A DISTINCT SITUATION WITH VARIABLE RESULTS.  Perez is right to bring in DDG. If not, he needs someone to compete with Navas who has all the talent in the world but is UNPROVEN to our circumstances.   BUT none of this is the point. The first and most important point is that we don't need a super GK. Our GK wasn't the problem this season. Our overreliance on Modric and other players who were injured or overwhelmed by a 8 man defensive line, poor health, and poor use of substitutes while not having a deep bench as we did last year was a problem for us. Getting Keylor and a competitor is our second priority. So far all we hear is DDG, DDG, IKER STAYS, IKER GOES, OMG NAVAS PLS... It's a media shitshow."

Our overreliance on Modric and other players who were injured or overwhelmed by a 8 man defensive line, poor health, and poor use of substitutes while not having a deep bench as we did last year was a problem for us.    This is 100% accurate.  Real Madrid does not need the world's best goalkeeper.  Hell, look at Barca.  We need to shore up the midfield and work on improving rotations.  Lack of play for our subs sunk us this past year."

realmadrid,3d481r,ace-s,3,Mon Jul 13 13:22:50 2015 UTC,"if he makes mistakes at the beginning of the season will be due to lack of minutes carrying from the season before. Keylor was the best 2014 Goalkeeper in la liga and one of the TOP keepers in the WC, surviving teams like ITALY, ENGLAND and URUGUAY, he also had a phenomenal game against the NETHERLANDS, the country that made Casillas look like a high school keeper.  ...... and you still doubt him? ......."

realmadrid,3d481r,pien11,1 point,Mon Jul 13 13:38:51 2015 UTC,"Levante finished fifth in goals allowed in the 13-14 league season despite allowing the most shots per game. If it wasn't for one atrocious game where Navas got left out to dry, they probably could've been right around the top-3 and that's almost all due to him given how atrocious their back line was. Him deflecting balls so often worries me a little, but if this team has to rely on him for a season then I think they'll be just fine."
realmadrid,3d481r,bozz14,0,Mon Jul 13 13:50:02 2015 UTC,Sure. Because Iker did fine. Our problem is not a GK problem. Navas will be okay although we need more than Pacheco if he gets injured again. But DDG will take precedence over Navas. A Costa Rican will never be a long term solution for a team like Madrid.
realmadrid,3d481r,joevaded,2,Mon Jul 13 14:46:50 2015 UTC,Why can't a Costa Rican be a long term solution? Kinda racist..

If there is a Madrid born keeper who is also a Roja player (and starter), he'll take precedence.   Madrid can be a tad xenophobic. Even Coentrao and Cristiano have talked about it at some point or another. It is much worse for central Americans.   Also, in our history Bodo is the only non-Spaniard keeper to have longevity and that was at the turn of the millennium, a German world class gk with a WORLD CUP in his belt.   Navas is good but... it isn't happening. We'd take Neuer, we will never have a Costa Rican national as a long term first team gk. It sucks, but it is what it is."

realmadrid,3d05h5,dallaskd,4,Sun Jul 12 12:52:01 2015 UTC,Iker's wage bill would be a problem.  Its hard to justify keeping him around as a backup GK until his contract with Real Madrid expires in 2017.    The standard practice in this kind of transfers is Real Madrid would be paying Iker's wage difference until 2017.  This is the only way Iker would agree to a move.  Since FC Porto wont be able to afford to match his current salary.    In the end all parties win.  Iker would still be able to play regular football as #1 GK with FC Porto.

Regardless of locker room issues (which will go on with Ramos and Arbeloa in the club), I believe that Navas was brought in to challenge Iker and make him better, but Navas didn't really get the chance to compete."
realmadrid,3d1d0e,awenga21,31,Sun Jul 12 18:40:29 2015 UTC,"The big media loves painting Madrid in a terrible light.  I have been hearing that we are supposed to be the biggest or second biggest (behind United) since I was a small boy but some days I find that to be almost unbelievable.    I cannot remember a time when Real were not hated fervently in most footballing circles.  When we lose, our transfer policy fails us yet again because we are plastic.  When we win, we are the big bad devils stealing the spotlight from the oh so holy Barcelona while ignoring each of their transgressions.  No matter what the scenario, it seems like people just really want someone to all gang up on and bash and we just so happen to be it.    In this case, I guess they would rather ignore the speculation that San Iker himself put a halt to a big farewell or the very fact that most proper fans are crying their hearts out."

In every single fb picture today there are comments about how we are the most plastic and hateful fans, but it isn't that way for Christs sake. I know probably most of us here are crying this farewell, I know personally it hurts me a lot, but then again it hurt to hear sections of the Bernabeu booing him. He's a legend, he never desered this treatment, and god be my witness I would kill to see him retire at Madrid. A kid born and raised in the club growing up to be probably the biggest landmark Madrid has to this day along with legends like di stefano, juanito, Raul, etc. I will always hate the fans that booed him, and the people on top who made him suffer, he didn't deserve any of this and I hope he has the happiest of careers from now on, hopefully seeing him back home soon.

realmadrid,3d1jp9,neklos,3,Mon Jul 13 17:28:37 2015 UTC,Does nobody rate Jese any more? The ACL may have slowed him down but given the promise he showed two seasons ago I feel pretty comfortable with him as a backup...
realmadrid,3d1jp9,mr_potroast,5,Mon Jul 13 01:32:54 2015 UTC,But Jese is more of a winger. He can't play center forward.
realmadrid,3d1jp9,kdatany,3,Mon Jul 13 13:56:20 2015 UTC,"From wikipedia: 'Jesé can play from a midfield position (behind the striker) to a winger position on either side of the field, as well as a centre-forward.'  While it may not be his most natural position, he can play there and has played there before"
realmadrid,3d1jp9,mr_potroast,5,Tue Jul 14 04:54:49 2015 UTC,I think we'll get someone when it's time. The only part I'm worrying about is if we are actually getting Zlatan. I was hoping someone younger than him.
realmadrid,3d1jp9,CrAppyF33ling,6,Sun Jul 12 19:41:22 2015 UTC,"What is weird is the fact that every time we had coaching changes we have made big/ some signings under the flo era. It is just uncommon to hear so little news this year. In fact, I think I have heard more about people leaving than coming to Madrid.   I am just thinking here but could it be that they don't want to make a big signing because it will negatively impact Benzema? When Pipita was in Madrid it seemed Benz was not happy and his performance increased immensely when he left."
realmadrid,3d1jp9,ThisIsSenpalll,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:47:46 2015 UTC,Maybe our big signing this time is De Gea . We don't have much link towards other positions
realmadrid,3d1jp9,abravenoob,2,Mon Jul 13 10:15:28 2015 UTC,I hope we sign someone young and Spanish. Paco Alcacer for example.
realmadrid,3d1jp9,bozz14,5,Sun Jul 12 19:44:44 2015 UTC,"They had just that in Morata and he left to get more playing time in order to develop properly since he was never going to fully mature by just sitting on the bench. Why would Alcacer be any different or an upgrade over Morata? Young strikers need as much playing time as possible, they won't get it at this club with a world class striker ahead of them on the depth chart."
realmadrid,3d1jp9,abravenoob,2,Sun Jul 12 20:57:53 2015 UTC,"Benitez will rotate much more than previous managers. Morata was here when we had Benzema & Higuain, so of course he didn't play much. Now that we only have Benzema, there's much more playing time to be had."
realmadrid,3d1jp9,bozz14,2,Sun Jul 12 21:41:47 2015 UTC,"No, Morata's big extended stay in the first team was when Higuain was already gone. Besides, even if Benitez rotates more, and I don't think he'll rotate nearly to the drastic extent that so many do, a young striker like Alcacer or Lacazette will still likely be playing less than they would elsewhere. Development-wise, coming to Madrid would stunt their growth. There's no way Morata would've grown like he has this past season if he got 20 minutes here or there or a spot start versus the likes of Elche."
realmadrid,3d1jp9,ItalianTacticz,0,Sun Jul 12 21:54:09 2015 UTC,"Lacazette is a better goalscorer than Benzema. More agile, faster, more versatile, a lower point of gravity and he just turned 24 in May. Benz on the other hand turns 28 in December."

Or give Jese a chance during the pre-season to prove himself and see if he can play full time on the wing with bale.

realmadrid,3d1jp9,abravenoob,0,Wed Jul 15 02:01:08 2015 UTC,"One other idea is to play James at CF. I think he'd be perfect there, which would allow us to be more defensive in midfield."
realmadrid,3d1jp9,dabumtsss,5,Sun Jul 12 22:35:10 2015 UTC,"No, that's an awful idea. James thrives when he can play a more creative, slightly deeper role; he's technically suited to play as a striker, I'd agree with that, but so much of his talent would be wasted if we made him play as a nine, especially when Benzema already fits the pseudo-midfielder role so well."
realmadrid,3d1jp9,abravenoob,1 point,Mon Jul 13 01:05:08 2015 UTC,"I don't mean him to be our full time out and out #9, but instead have him slot down to CF as the 2nd option when Benzema isn't playing as opposed to buying a backup CF. It would allow Isco to play his true #10 position with two CDMs for cover.  Not every game, but I'd like to see how it works against certain match ups."
realmadrid,3d1jp9,dabumtsss,3,Mon Jul 13 01:14:17 2015 UTC,"Is Isco really a #10? I think James is again, more suited for the #10 with Isco either dropping back to CM (against weaker sides) or playing out wider, since he doesn't have the same vision and ability to create as James does.  It's an interesting idea though, but I just feel like there are better options within the squad for that position regardless."
realmadrid,3d1jp9,abravenoob,3,Mon Jul 13 01:19:49 2015 UTC,"He's only a CM because of how Ancelotti used him. Isco is a true #10, like James. We're just spoiled enough to have both."
realmadrid,3d1jp9,mr_potroast,1 point,Mon Jul 13 01:31:33 2015 UTC,"Isco played #10 for Malaga and many would say that's his natural role. The same could be said for James, Kroos and Modric too (and some people are suggesting Bale will play there??). So who knows what will happen"
realmadrid,3d1jp9,dabumtsss,1 point,Mon Jul 13 01:29:40 2015 UTC,"Modric won't play their for sure, even in his last season at Tottenham, he was very much a center-mid.  I think Ancelotti wanted to convert Kroos into a CM as well, but what Benitez will do is beyong our knowledge. Bale isn't technically gifted enough for it, good god who suggested that. I suppose that Isco could play their, but again, it comes done to where on the field can he make the greatest impact."
realmadrid,3d1jp9,bozz14,-2,Mon Jul 13 01:32:20 2015 UTC,Isco isn't a true 10. At Malaga his best performances were out wide and moving in. He's not an Ozil type to be played through the center as the primary facilitator.

realmadrid,3cysgl,dallaskd,2,Sun Jul 12 12:54:58 2015 UTC,"I know, it feels so tainted somehow.   What I think should have happened haha, is we should have bought DDG as planned, then alternated them throughout the season with a preference for DDG and then Iker could have faded off nicely as DDG became established before leaving at the end of the 15/16 season and DDG bein our ""full time gk"". But that's a slightly romanticized plan, I'm sure it's more complex than that, maybe IC didn't want to play second fiddle to someone?

realmadrid,3czzqj,mpg1846,3,Sun Jul 12 12:53:14 2015 UTC,They're not traveling with the team but I think they are meeting them there.
realmadrid,3czzqj,Psychoartist1,6,Sun Jul 12 14:01:59 2015 UTC,James and Casemiro are on vacation till the 23rd. Ronaldo supposedly is going to be there at some point though.
realmadrid,3czzqj,mpg1846,0,Sun Jul 12 15:51:48 2015 UTC,The tour is pointless is Ronaldo doesn't show.
realmadrid,3czzqj,kuron3k0,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:39:45 2015 UTC,I know. But I was reading somewhere that they are not travelling with the team so I assumed that they won't come. I may be wrong.

realmadrid,3cx530,ace-s,8,Sat Jul 11 16:25:36 2015 UTC,He voted for Ozil because he's a fellow Turk. It's hilarious looking at the votes from everybody and seeing the rampant nepotism.
realmadrid,3cx530,numandina,12,Sun Jul 12 08:35:33 2015 UTC,Don't forget Arjen Robben who also played for Madrid once :)

realmadrid,3cx530,Flam1,1 point,Sat Jul 11 19:57:03 2015 UTC,Özil was very good in 2013

realmadrid,3cx530,Flam1,1 point,Sun Jul 12 05:23:57 2015 UTC,Yeah ok. But him being in the top 3 is right imo.

realmadrid,3cx530,Adventures_Of_Anand,-14,Sat Jul 11 17:20:14 2015 UTC,Why would liking Barca and RM be a problem? Some people are so close-minded. You realize it literally doesn't matter at all.

realmadrid,3cx530,GiantsRTheBest2,0,Thu Jul 16 05:26:57 2015 UTC,Sure you can like them just like I like Manchester United and Manchester City. But I'm not claiming to be a fan of either of them. I'm a fan of Real Madrid meaning I dislike anything Barcelona (the team not the city) and Atletico Madrid.
realmadrid,3cx530,TheGogoy,-1,Sat Jul 11 20:08:48 2015 UTC,whats the point of supporting a team then? Half the fun is going full tribal

realmadrid,3cx530,TheGogoy,4,Sat Jul 11 17:56:54 2015 UTC,"maybe he means Messi is the better player overall, which isn't as shocking"
realmadrid,3cx530,GiantsRTheBest2,-1,Sat Jul 11 22:22:50 2015 UTC,It is when they are both so close that saying one is better comes down to matter of opinion and his opinion is that he thinks a Barcelona player is the best player in the world especially when who he is choosing over is a Madrid player/legend
realmadrid,3cx530,TheGogoy,3,Sun Jul 12 05:57:03 2015 UTC,It isn't that simple

realmadrid,3cy6i6,iMadrid11,16,Sat Jul 11 21:17:14 2015 UTC,Don't be silly.  Iker Casillas at age 19 didn't have any CL experience when he won it in 2000.
realmadrid,3cy6i6,zeNap,14,Sat Jul 11 21:44:58 2015 UTC,Neither did ter Stegen with Barca.
realmadrid,3cy6i6,ChedduhBob,2,Sat Jul 11 22:24:23 2015 UTC,"this means a deal is close to being done. idk whether that is de gea, leno, Casilla, or what, but one of those three will be announced soon.  If it is Leno or Casilla, I think it will be a competition for the number one spot, but with De Gea he will be the number one immediately."
realmadrid,3cy6i6,bozz14,2,Sat Jul 11 21:45:27 2015 UTC,"If it's Leno then he should be the number one immediately. I love Navas a ton, but Leno is a starting keeper for a CL side and is considered by menu to be the second best German keeper.

realmadrid,3cxkh3,Lewanrobski,15,Sat Jul 11 17:59:07 2015 UTC,Does he just not take care of himself? I can't understand how someone can be so fragile.
realmadrid,3cxkh3,girllikethat,11,Sat Jul 11 18:25:53 2015 UTC,He must not. He also smokes so that's kind of indicative of his professional attitude towards his body.
realmadrid,3cxkh3,brazenrumraisin,6,Sat Jul 11 19:21:05 2015 UTC,I wondered if he was a smoker. I feel like players should be punished for that. When I had an injury the only thing my physiotherapist's said would alter the speed of my recovery process was if I smoked or not.
realmadrid,3cxkh3,girllikethat,8,Sat Jul 11 19:51:35 2015 UTC,"He is indeed, here he is smoking, and next to Cristiano infecting him no less haha. Under no circumstance should an athlete be smoking, it's ridiculous and as you say, it will hinder his recovery from all these injuries.   I think he did get in trouble for it when Mou was there."
realmadrid,3cxkh3,brazenrumraisin,6,Sat Jul 11 19:54:49 2015 UTC,"I feel like people's mothers when I see player's smoking. I saw Verratti doing it on his vacations just the other day too. So disappointing. In an athlete your body's the only thing you've got going for you, why would you screw it up for a smoke."
realmadrid,3cxkh3,girllikethat,6,Sat Jul 11 20:32:27 2015 UTC,"Me too, I get so judgy about it, go full mum mode.   They'll look back and regret it when they're retired and it's too late to be better, at least CR or similar people will be able to look back and say they did absolutely everything they could to keep their body as healthy as possible and be the best they can be."
realmadrid,3cxkh3,brazenrumraisin,3,Sat Jul 11 20:37:29 2015 UTC,We should attend a game together and tut really loudly when we see him.
realmadrid,3cxkh3,girllikethat,4,Sat Jul 11 20:46:29 2015 UTC,Or just follow him around snatching cigs out of his mouth until he gets the message. This has to stop haha.

realmadrid,3cxkh3,torosFCP,5,Sat Jul 11 18:54:53 2015 UTC,"Fabio is a great LB; he is better at defense that Marcelo and that makes him viable for Benitez rotations however he has always been ""made of glass""; be it in high competition tournaments or during his breaks he always manages to injure himself which leads to bad physical condition and getting injured yet again.  I hope that he makes a full and speedy recovery so that he is match fit by the start of La Liga, I'm sure that with enough play time and Rafa's rotations Fabio could be an asset."
realmadrid,3cxkh3,GobbusterMX,2,Sat Jul 11 21:48:01 2015 UTC,The medical report said that he got injured during the holidays. I'm having a hard time imagining how fragile he really is.

realmadrid,3cxkh3,Negrodamus07,6,Sat Jul 11 19:48:00 2015 UTC,"to be honest, Marcelo is a great player but he lacks defensively. We need a solid back-up LB against very strong teams"
realmadrid,3cxkh3,ace-s,2,Sat Jul 11 21:09:32 2015 UTC,Club is keen on Abner according to Marca. The Brazilian LB they signed for Castilla last season. He'll be going to the Australia tour with the team.
realmadrid,3cxkh3,crazyeyes91,1 point,Sun Jul 12 07:13:01 2015 UTC,He's probably just going for depth. He's had multiple major injuries and is nowhere ready enough for the first team.
realmadrid,3cxkh3,bozz14,1 point,Sun Jul 12 14:10:03 2015 UTC,Turns out he isn't even going. Marca was wrong lol. Yes the multiple ACL injury isn't exactly giving me much hope.

Edit:  I should add that the whole squad numbers thing is a relatively recent evolution in football. For most of football's history, players on the pitch wore the numbers 1 to 11 - e.g. whoever was playing up front wore the number 9 shirt for the match."

Also, don't all squads have to have numbers 1-25 in La Liga? Does that mean the team gets one less player or they get the exception to use a number above 25?"

realmadrid,3cyb9o,murphmeister75,3,Sun Jul 12 09:28:49 2015 UTC,If we didn't retire 7 for Raul no way 1 gets retired for Iker. We'll probably give it to DeGea our next GK.
realmadrid,3cyb9o,crazyeyes91,3,Sun Jul 12 07:04:49 2015 UTC,"They didn't retire the number 9 after Di Estefano and he was more of a legend than Iker. To get your jersey number retired you must wear something that no one else would wear, a high number like 86 that way it's easier to retire it, not the number 1 or 7"
realmadrid,3cyb9o,GiantsRTheBest2,1 point,Sun Jul 12 06:22:09 2015 UTC,TBH No they should not. Yes I am aware of everything Casillas has done for the club both on and off the pitch but as people below have stated we didn't retire 7 for Raul nor 9 for Di Stefano.
realmadrid,3cyb9o,zeNap,1 point,Sun Jul 12 10:27:35 2015 UTC,Same as when this was suggested during Raul's departure... RM is an institution greater than any of its individual  players. To retire a number would be to put a player above the institution and that's something that will I don't think is in the DNA of Real Madrid.

realmadrid,3cx2b1,ChedduhBob,2,Sat Jul 11 15:16:18 2015 UTC,I wouldn't recommend wearing a jersey like that to play all the time.  Also don't dry it because that really fucks up shirts
realmadrid,3cx2b1,dmcc1990,2,Sat Jul 11 15:53:38 2015 UTC,"Same thing happened to my 13/14 home Bale shirt, bottom of the numbers were starting to peel so I put a piece of cardboard in between the front and back of the shirt and a white tee shirt over the numbers and put a iron on the numbers for 15sec or so and that should put the material back on the shirt."
realmadrid,3cx2b1,brazenrumraisin,1 point,Sat Jul 11 19:16:49 2015 UTC,"It's most likely heat dissolving the adhesive, wash it on the coldest setting or hand wash it if you can be bothered and then dry it on the cool/cold dryer setting if yours has it or air dry.   Seeing as after a good play it really needs a proper hot wash, I would stop wearing it."
realmadrid,3cx2b1,GiantsRTheBest2,1 point,Sat Jul 11 17:10:49 2015 UTC,Don't take those types of jerseys to play. Try to wash it as least as possible and when you do don't put it in the dryer since the heat makes it peel just put it to air dry.
realmadrid,3cx2b1,dabumtsss,1 point,Sat Jul 11 17:23:38 2015 UTC,"Unless it's the adipure jersey or whatever it's called, (the actual, exact replica of what is used by players in games) then you probably shouldn't use it to play.

realmadrid,3ct7fe,BluePineapple19,10,Fri Jul 10 16:05:39 2015 UTC,"Would be great if the club needed him, but they don't. The wide attacking positions are well covered. Jese and Vazquez can serve as the first ones off the bench and even James and Isco can fill in out wide."
realmadrid,3ct7fe,bozz14,4,Fri Jul 10 16:12:38 2015 UTC,He mostly plays as striker for Sociedad (under Moyesy at least). Him being able to play on the wings or as a CF as well is a bonus too.
realmadrid,3ct7fe,infinite-identity,1 point,Fri Jul 10 22:01:15 2015 UTC,"But how many minutes will he get at striker? If Benz has to sit a game out then it almost stands to reason that CR will fill in up top while someone like Jese will be added to the wings. I don't see why Vela would join only to see his minutes drastically reduced. I know that many are expecting heavy-duty rotations from Benitez but I'm not one of them. More than Ancelotti, certainly, but not a fresh 11 or big names being benched every other game."
realmadrid,3ct7fe,bozz14,1 point,Fri Jul 10 22:21:05 2015 UTC,"Completely agree. Yep, you make an especially good point on rotation- even Luis Enrique and Mou with Madrid, despite all the rotations, still have a clear best XI which is mostly unchanged except maybe in the games against weaker sides.   Having said that, I think we do need a second out and out striker because Ronaldo isn't exactly that, especially if Benz gets an injury as he often does. Vela wouldn't be a bad option to have."
realmadrid,3ct7fe,infinite-identity,7,Fri Jul 10 22:39:57 2015 UTC,"Wouldn't be a bad signing if it happens. I believe Benitez does love to rotate his his squads so he would get playing time with CL,La liga,and CDR."

I'm not very familiar with how a magnet school works, but from my understanding, it's a school that admits students from outside the school's area.  Students have to take an admission exam and must maintain a C or better or they are removed from the school.    The key to dealing with ""bad"" kids is consistency.  Have discipline plan and stick to it, and don't stop instruction in order to discipline someone."
realmadrid,3csfxq,fatt_guy,1 point,Fri Jul 10 13:33:51 2015 UTC,"Ah I've never heard of magnet schools. However I do agree with you with the bad kids. My middle school teacher was so good at it that he eventually became a good kid but still a bit of a troublemaker. By the time we all graduated he was a good kid. It helped that it was a new school and the atmosphere of all teachers and students were friendly since we all stayed in the same class and didn't really switch around moving up through the grades.  I've had one teacher in high school where he gave a no nonsense policy. If you interrupted class 3 times you're out and escorted into the office. One particular bad day had 7 students escorted out. While I guess it didn't really help the students, it did help that those students very rarely acted up in his class for the remaining of the year."

realmadrid,3csfxq,fatt_guy,1 point,Fri Jul 10 13:53:57 2015 UTC,In my area the magnet schools are usually schools where the kids want to be there. This will mean that they probably want to do well and you won't have too many issues.
realmadrid,3csfxq,ChedduhBob,2,Fri Jul 10 14:34:12 2015 UTC,"I believe that's the case here too.  The students are there because they WANT to be.

I'll have a set of rules (no more than 5) and I'll consistently enforce them, but I want be a dick about it."

realmadrid,3csfxq,ponderingmeerkat,6,Fri Jul 10 13:48:00 2015 UTC,"Saint Iker was the one who started my obsession with Real Madrid and football. My first El Clasico, Barcelona ( 2-0, L) and the CL game against Liverpool ( 4-0, L), even though they were both loses were some of the best football I have ever watched from an individual player. Iker was like a freaking brick wall who gave his all to save Real Madrid from humiliation after being bombarded with shots after shots. I have never seen a player save a team's ass as much as Casillas has saved Spain's and Real Madrid's. I have seen several terrible performances from Real Madrid with superstars in almost every position yet in those game there would only be a single galactico on the field, Saint Iker Casillas. He is a legend. He is the reason why I love football as much as I do."

We've been blindsided so many times before, that it's always a risk buying jerseys during the transfer window, in case the player leaves. Or sometimes players change numbers before the season starts (i.e. Isco). Also, the jersey sellers get better at replicating the jersey as time passes, so sometimes its good to wait till the end of August/early September to order them!

realmadrid,3cq4gb,LosBlancosSR4,2,Thu Jul 9 23:34:12 2015 UTC,"Definitely solid advice here!  Additionally: always be sure to read feedback, not just look at percent. Try to pick a seller that ships ePacket, as it is faster and much more reliable than China Post. Always ask for more photos from the seller!

realmadrid,3cq4gb,Nhlfreak98,1 point,Fri Jul 10 22:23:02 2015 UTC,"Honestly I think the jerseys are authentic. Let's think about this. If you check all of the sellers, you find that they're almost all in China, correct? Why only in China? Why do only the Chinese have this presumably perfect material that is exactly like the real thing? Why are there no Tibetan or Mexican or Australian sellers? Yeah that's because all the factories and cheap labor are in China. Sometimes, the factories make too many jerseys or some jerseys are ""sub par"". Instead of tossing these in the dump, they'll give them to locals. (Kind of the same thing where in the US during the Superbowl, both teams already have apparel labeled ""(insert team name here) 2015 champions!"". The winner's apparel is sold, the loser's is shipped off to other countries where the poor can use it.) The locals will realize ""holy shit this is a Real Madrid jersey"" and ""These sell for 620 Chinese yuan ($100)+ online"" and put two and two together. Why not sell it cheap for like $20 and get a profit? After all, they got it for free from the factory, and if they were to sell it for the original 620 yuan+ a person would be more likely to buy from the actual site which they're sure they will get the shirt as opposed to a seller in China trying to make a living."
realmadrid,3cq4gb,reddit809,1 point,Fri Jul 10 03:50:51 2015 UTC,"Their not authentic because the team does not authorize them but I agree with you, they probably are made in the same factory but a small defct or something causes them to not be sold by madrid.

realmadrid,3cny39,bozz14,14,Thu Jul 9 12:29:18 2015 UTC,I'm so hyped about Danilo. I think he's got the complete skillset to be a right-sided Alaba. Price was big but I think it's worth it when the RB market is so unbelievably thin and when it comes to someone of his quality. Great addition.
realmadrid,3cny39,corn_diggity,2,Thu Jul 9 12:35:29 2015 UTC,I think his play style is much more similar to Alves.  Both of them have the long shot and Danilo is quick but not in Jordi's leauge  edit: long shot*

After Danilo took number 23 it leaves numbers 14, 18 and 21 available.   If I had to guess then Casemiro takes 14, Vasquez takes 18 and 21 goes to someone else we bring in this summer (like a backup striker)."

realmadrid,3clkz4,zeNap,2,Thu Jul 9 11:36:06 2015 UTC,"To think that this entire situation is avoidable, it really makes this predicament even more upsetting. If Casillas simply accepts a back up role, we can play Navas/DDG as a starter and have Casillas on the bench.   I can't imagine Madrid without Casillas, can't even fathom seeing him in a different shirt."
realmadrid,3clkz4,LosBlancosSR4,3,Thu Jul 9 20:05:37 2015 UTC,"Why would he though? Pirlo knows he can still play first team football but not as good as before so he is off. Iker knows it so he is off.   If Madrid prioritizes De Gea and Navas, then this decision is good for Iker and we should be happy for him. If Madrid prioritizes De Gea and Iker, then Navas should go and we should be happy for him.  I've followed football long enough to know that not everyone who loves this club ends their careers here and all that means is I get to learn a new team and sometimes a new culture."
realmadrid,3clkz4,joevaded,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:11:57 2015 UTC,"True. But since we play in 3 big tournaments a season, I'm sure something could have been worked out in such a way that both goalies get a fair amount of games (like our CL winning season). Of course, we don't know what Iker truly feels. Maybe he wants to play every single game, which is something that we can't provide anymore.   I guess what I'm getting at is, I just really wanted Iker to retire in a Madrid shirt"
realmadrid,3clkz4,LosBlancosSR4,2,Thu Jul 9 20:17:16 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure if it work. With two keepers it was hard. And I can answer your question with regards to Iker, Navas and every other professional on their level.. they def want to play a lot. They have the age and talent for it.  I understand though. I feel the same way. However, he'll be back. I have no doubt. Guti is already here, Hierro is an asst. coach, Iker will return.   Whatever jersey he wears, he'll have white underneath."
realmadrid,3clkz4,joevaded,2,Thu Jul 9 20:20:32 2015 UTC,I haven't really been too fond of Casillas after the Diego Lopez & Mourinho thing. But god damn did that video bring back memories. That man bleeds white it will be sad to see him leave to Porto without a big exit during a game a la Xavi
realmadrid,3clkz4,GiantsRTheBest2,2,Thu Jul 9 13:46:23 2015 UTC,Please elaborate on the Diego Lopez situation?
realmadrid,3clkz4,pyroaxis,2,Thu Jul 9 16:14:47 2015 UTC,"There was no situation. Iker was a pro. He stayed quiet, defended Lopez and Lopez himself said that the relationship was normal.  A lot of people here aren't Spanish and their principle sources are even worse than the ones that we have. Marca is terrible for some things as it like to stir up drama, but Marca ENGLISH is worse because they outsourced that dept. to people who water down the Spanish content.  Goal.com, the Brit tabloids... this is why /r/soccer is so uninformed with regards to our team. And sadly, a lot of our fans."
realmadrid,3clkz4,joevaded,-1,Thu Jul 9 17:10:09 2015 UTC,Diego Lopez was the better GK so he benched Casillas and Casillas went off bitching and crying to the press to get his starting spot back.
realmadrid,3clkz4,GiantsRTheBest2,3,Thu Jul 9 16:26:41 2015 UTC,"Wow, what utter bullshit.  Casillas said ZERO things to the press. He stayed quiet. And when Lopez fucked up an easy stop to lose to Atletico he came out and DEFENDED him.  What are you talking about? If you're going to commit libel against a Madrid legend, this is not the place nor the time."
realmadrid,3clkz4,joevaded,-7,Thu Jul 9 17:08:22 2015 UTC,"Well it's all speculation but you seem to be in the minority that Casillas did nothing wrong. The majority think that he may have had a hand in all the controversy, some even calling him out for everything that went wrong."
realmadrid,3clkz4,GiantsRTheBest2,4,Thu Jul 9 17:52:51 2015 UTC,You are the kind of gullible morons that were booing Casillas for past 2 seasons jut because of misinformation and lack of fuckin brain .

You are lucky I don't give a shit about you or the other dumb ass to go online and fine a ton of articles from AS and Marca on how Casillas would put pressure on the club to put him in the starting spot and to get rid of Mourinho. No wonder people talk so much shit about you, you're annoying as fuck."

realmadrid,3clkz4,RM_CR7,0,Thu Jul 9 18:40:05 2015 UTC,"No. What the hell does ""Buzz"" mean? Lopez said he was a class act. Navas has said as much. Not even Mourinho has said half the shit the trash papers say and the gullible eat up. I get a lot of the users are not in Spain, but this is fucking embarrasing. The biggest campaigns for this drama have been by tabloid pieces of shit and Barca sympathizers like Pedrerol.  Topo wasn't even the accurate term but its the one the tabloids picked up and its the one fake fans went with.  To say Iker's talent has declined is one thing. There is merit to it, it might be physical, it might be emotional... whatever.  To disrespect him? That has no place here. To perpetuate tabloid, yellow journalism, that smears an icon of the club?

I wouldn't mind him leaving to another club in his final years but what annoys me is how sore things were in the final months with some ""fans"" booing him. Regardless of any mistakes he made over the past couple of years as he's past his prime, he deserves all the respect for many years of service to the club. Either way, I wish him best of luck wherever he's going. All bad feelings aside, he's appreciated by true fans."

realmadrid,3ck33r,ShadowX22,5,Thu Jul 9 08:10:42 2015 UTC,"Barca fan here. I admire Casillas and have a huge respect for him. And it is really sad to see someone so devoted to a club like Real Madrid leave in such circumstances. Starting from being benched the whole season by Mourinho and then getting booed by fans. From the looks of it, Casillas did try his all to fight, stay and be a Madrista until his career end, but this was inevitable due to the said circumstances. I am really wondering, why has this situation arised? Casillas has been a devoted Madrista, more so a leader every time he's on the pitch. A club legend. I want to understand how this situation came to be? I don't remember why Mourinho benched Casillas. Was he under performing(unthinkable, considering his standard)? or was it off the pitch stuff? whatever, it's always tough to handle when a long time club legend decides to leave. good luck to him!"
realmadrid,3ck33r,jd1017,3,Wed Jul 8 19:25:29 2015 UTC,"Casillas hasn't been the Casillas of yore. His reflexes have slowed and he's no longer able to make those miracle saves that he used to make.  Mourinho benched Casillas due to Mourinho perceiving Casillas' form dropping. This is probably what caused the rift to begin between Casillas and Mourinho.  So really the situation is that Casillas is entering into the twilight of his career and is no longer able to perform at the level required of a Real Madrid keeper. New blood is to be brought in. So while Casillas could take a backseat role and more of a mentor role, it appears that he's not ready to hang up his boots yet. What it looks like now is that Madrid is doing what they can to ensure that Casillas can move on by paying the vast majority of his salary regardless of where he moves. Much like they did with Raul. Both were no longer the players that cemented themselves as legends of Real Madrid, but neither were ready to retire fully yet."

realmadrid,3ck33r,agugaga,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:53:12 2015 UTC,Sad day. I was very critical of him the last 3 years but in all honesty he wasn't that bad this year. He isn't an every day starter at madrid but there is a room for him here to finish out his career. Hope he regains his form at Porto and dominates  Don't keepers usually stay In their primes longer? Casillas seems rather young to start hitting that wall

realmadrid,3cjcil,iMadrid11,2,Wed Jul 8 13:54:22 2015 UTC,Michael Jordan pretty much owns the #23 regardless what sport you play because he's that kind of a legend.    David Beckham chose #23 since Raul owns the #7 shirt and is a club legend.  In fact when Cristiano Ronaldo arrived at the Bernabaue in 2009 he got the #9 shirt since Raul was still around.

You'd only be kidding yourself if you think this wasn't a major reason for why this is being done.  He played almost as well as he did the year of La Decima and that year was full of praise for San Iker.  The difference this year was that so many judged him with the World Cup fresh in mind and every minor mistake was blown out of proportion. Minor mistakes that ALL goalkeepers make, only difference is Iker was put under a microscope."

So sell one player who managed to move to the right from left and make another one go through that process ? Also for 140 theoretically you could buy hazard. Do you think chelsea would sell? no way. only viable option to replace bale and the one that would make sense and is actually possible would be reus ... or maybe sanchez

He causes a lot of problems for opposing teams.not to mention before he signed with chelsea he said if Zidane called him and asked him to come to madrid he would come in a heartbeat. He's toeing the line of being one of this generations consistent greats. The only thing that's stopping him is putting the team on his back and not being phased out, and finishing."

I'm not saying he isn't an amazing player, but we don't need him. I'm sick of luxury buys. If we don't need him, we shouldn't buy him just because he's good. Especially if it means selling or sitting Spanish players."
realmadrid,3chlk9,Lewanrobski,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:20:05 2015 UTC,"Uhm, Hazard is a left winger, right? What is Bale in the upcoming season? A LEFT WINGER. So, deploying Hazard on the left wing is, from my perspective, a good thing. Ronaldo will probably be a striker. If not,  there will be no reason to buy Hazard. But from what I have read and assumed (4231 that Benitez likes), is that the left wing will be for Bale next season. Who was speaking about right wingers anyways?"
realmadrid,3chlk9,ShiroQ,-2,Wed Jul 8 12:21:56 2015 UTC,Will be! he was not playing on the left for 2 seasons. With ronaldo in the team you dont know. sure its good that benitez will but bale on the left. but what if it does not work out and ronaldo asks to play left again? what then... Fact is chelsea wont sell  for 100m euros  140 maybe but its crazy. might as well pay 200m for messi not that it would happen but still ...

realmadrid,3chlk9,inu50kza,2,Wed Jul 8 16:32:00 2015 UTC,"Neither Chelsea nor City would sell their star players for £100m. Especially Chelsea, their entire team is built around Hazard. They're both making an extra £50m a year from the new tv deals alone and commercial revenue is ballooning year upon year. Even without that they don't need the money.  Neither can replace Hazard/Aguero with that money and don't need the money to patch up squad issues.   Only way to get either would be for the player to force a move and neither player seems likely to do that."

Can't believe how important he has become to our team. Hope when he retires, he becomes a legit Madrid legend like Cristiano, Marcelo, Sergio and Iker. I don't consider any honor better than that."
realmadrid,3chc58,KingJamesX,6,Tue Jul 7 23:39:40 2015 UTC,"Simple, we won games when he played and lost games when he didnt  He was irreplaceable"
realmadrid,3chc58,punkfusion,6,Wed Jul 8 18:48:34 2015 UTC,"Our performances with and without says it all about his quality and importance in our side. It's sad that we played more games without him than with him in our XI and we suffered because of that. He's a very unique player in that he combines a strong workrate with immense technical ability. He's one of those players that you can rely on to be in the right place at the right time, whether that's to cut out a pass or recieve a pass.  His presence on the field gave us an outlet on the right hand side. This stopped us and our opposition overloading (our) left hand side and gave us more space and more variety. He's smart enough to know when to hit the killer pass or when to keep the ball a while longer. Kroos sits at the base of the midfield and keeps the system ticking over, Modric was responsible for setting the pace. If you compared our games with and without him, you would see that we lost that element of control over some matches."
realmadrid,3chc58,Alopolis,4,Wed Jul 8 01:40:13 2015 UTC,I hate how little credit this man gets from non Real Madrid fans. When we started losing form everyone started saying that it was because Di Maria was sold.   Modric is one of the most important players we have maybe behind only Ronaldo. And it's a shame that not a lot of people see that.
realmadrid,3chc58,Tigriski,19,Thu Jul 9 21:29:53 2015 UTC,"When healthy he is the best midfielder in the world in my honest opinion. He has superb vision and intelligence, and he does a great job moving/recycling the ball around. Without him it was clear that our possession was noticeably worse. Combined with excellent work rate Luka Modric is easily the second most important player after Cristiano Ronaldo. When he went down no one was able to replicate what he could do (Kroos alone wasn't enough), and it would be difficult to find a replacement for him considering how good he is."
realmadrid,3chc58,KatsuraYuuki,4,Tue Jul 7 23:28:48 2015 UTC,"He's my absolute fav player. Irreplaceable by any player right now, imo. One might fill the void eventually, but as you said, best in the world at the moment when healthy."
realmadrid,3chc58,StrikerGuy7,4,Wed Jul 8 07:17:18 2015 UTC,The impact his injuries had on our season show that he truly is the best midfielder in the world at the moment.
realmadrid,3chc58,DeletoiD,3,Wed Jul 8 07:43:17 2015 UTC,"After he went down, we played noticeably worse, and the second injury was basically the kiss of death on the season. He was such a presence both offensively and defensively, it just killed our entire gameplan and style of play with him out (in addition to the injury to James).  He has a great work rate, and he is also probably the most technical player on our team when you consider his ability on the ball, and his ability to find some key passes. His outside the foot passes are unrivaled imo.  Another thing that I think a lot of people didn't acknowledge when he left was that he didn't get to deliver the set pieces any more. I don't have statistics to this claim, but I think he might be the best at delivering in set pieces on corners and short set pieces from the side. With players like Ronaldo, Ramos, Pepe, Varane, Bale, and Benzema that are super athletic, this is kinda important. Kroos still delivers good ones though so maybe this wasn't as big of a deal.  In the future, I think we need to start looking to sign young players that can fulfill his role. I don't necessarily mean that we need to go out and sign Pogba and Veratti (although both are brilliant), but I think we need to start getting ready for this. Modric will soon turn 30, he is coming off a pretty injury riddled season, and this may hurt the length of his career. Obviously, he doesn't need his physical traits as much as someone like Bale or Ronaldo, but his work rate was one of the most important things for us, and that may not be as high when he comes back. Looking ahead of time for that replacement will not only set us up for the future, it will also maybe help if he does get injured, and we are not stuck without a massive part of our strategy gone."
realmadrid,3chc58,ChedduhBob,3,Tue Jul 7 22:38:36 2015 UTC,"The thing about the set pieces was a good point. I noticed that too. Would figure having Toni on the outside of the box on set pieces would be more beneficial than having Luka there. It will be interesting to see who Rafa Benitez uses for set pieces.  I also noticed when Luka was playing, quality delivery to Bale was increased drastically, as they seem to be more in sync with each other offensively than Bale and any other midfielder.   Luka also gave us offensive threat in the form of through balls up the middle, and the ability to control play just outside the penalty box. Stark difference between the always cross and hope someone gets on the end of it"" tactic we seemed to be using when we needed goals in the last part of the season.  Really hoping he can give it another solid year or two and retire with Madrid, he's the man who brought me to be a Madridista and i'd be great to see him retire as a Madrid Star."
realmadrid,3chc58,Skohm,3,Tue Jul 7 22:49:51 2015 UTC,year or two? I hope he doesn't retire at 30...  with his intelligence and ability I could see him playing at the top level for another 4-5 years
realmadrid,3chc58,mr_potroast,3,Wed Jul 8 01:17:24 2015 UTC,"There is no words to describe how crucial he is to our midfield. Every match Madrid plays without him is shaped entirely different. There is no one in the team who can control the midfield as well as he can. In every game where he doesn't play, the general avenues of attack come from the wings, with Luka we have much more depth and penetration through the middle of the pitch, it makes the team much more unpredictable and seem less desperate .   I consider him to be the most important player in the team and I enjoy watching Madrid more with him on the pitch."
realmadrid,3chc58,acidvolt,2,Wed Jul 8 16:47:19 2015 UTC,"Remember also how quickly he came back from his injuries! He was about 6 months out and took him 2 subs to regain form. If I'm not mistaken, at his 3rd game we was already in the starting XI... Unlike some other players that needed 4 years to in the end, never regain full form... Looking at you kaka.."
realmadrid,3chc58,antoniomteixeira,2,Wed Jul 8 09:24:50 2015 UTC,"I fell in love with him when he played for Tottenham and upon hearing that we are buying him my heart skipped several beats.  He is without a doubt the single best midfielder on planet when healthy.  With Benitez' habit of rotation, he will likely be very pivotal this coming season."
realmadrid,3chc58,Commandophile,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:06:17 2015 UTC,Do you guys feel like verratti would be a good rotational player with Modric? As we saw last season it's too risky to depend on him being healthy all season.

realmadrid,3cfiq1,saltbeefbagel,19,Tue Jul 7 14:48:49 2015 UTC,"Not with RM but with the national team, Euro 2012 when he asked the assistant ref to stop the game in added time out of respect for Italy while Spain was up 4-0. The guy is pure class. If he leaves he will be greatly missed. I'm glad I became a fan of the team in time to see Casillas at his greatest."
realmadrid,3cfiq1,lando786,12,Tue Jul 7 15:10:06 2015 UTC,When we are about to win la Decima and you can see Casillas is crying....oh God...Im not ready for Iker to leave....   EDIT: This
realmadrid,3cfiq1,SmokiestElfo,7,Tue Jul 7 19:07:39 2015 UTC,"So many good ones posted already. For Spain, the paradón with his toe vs. Robben in the 2010 WC final. I remember that moment so clearly, my stomach was in my throat. Shouldn't have doubted Iker though. And then when the final whistle blew and he collapsed in tears, that was so beautiful. And, as captain, lifting Spain's first WC!  I don't even know where to begin with Real Madrid... He singlehandedly won points for Madrid for years. I'll just give one from this season. Last home game vs. Getafe he was being whistled (as usual) and a sizable portion of the crowd drowned out the whistling by chanting his name. And then he made a nice save right after and acknowledged the crowd. It was really touching to see after all the shit he's been getting."
realmadrid,3cfiq1,pale_cerulean_dot,2,Tue Jul 7 17:00:23 2015 UTC,For me that save from Robben in the WC final is my no.1 Casillas memory. Increible.
realmadrid,3cfiq1,phishua,8,Fri Jul 10 18:02:55 2015 UTC,"During the final seconds of the 2010 WC Final against Holland - Spain was up 1-0, and in the final minute, with the action at the far side of the pitch, he fell to his knees and cried as the dream of a Spanish victory became a reality.    For Madrid?  I don't know, there are so many ""paradones"" he has made over the years.  So many crucial, split-second saves.  I've loved them all."
realmadrid,3cfiq1,IHaveHugeNick,15,Tue Jul 7 16:11:35 2015 UTC,"CL final vs. Leverkusen in 2001. He came on from the bench after 1st goalkeeper got injured, looking so young I'd give him 15 years tops.   Right off the bat he started screaming and organizing the defenders who were twice his age, and ended up making bunch of critical saves. At that moment the world knew he's gonna be someone special."
realmadrid,3cfiq1,ChedduhBob,7,Tue Jul 7 16:33:14 2015 UTC,The picture of him and Ramos crying at the end of the 2012/13 champions league campaign juxtaposed with the 2013/14 one is great. Just that year of finally delivering La Decima.
realmadrid,3cfiq1,maysunaneek,10,Tue Jul 7 18:21:48 2015 UTC,"IMO, Iker's summary at Madrid can be summarized from his performance away vs Liverpool, where we lost 4-0. More often than not he had to keep his team in contention with a shit defence for so many seasons while being over-looked.  It's a shame his career has wired down to the current scenario. Deserves more than he has received.   In hindsight, he should have also won more silverwares at Madrid."
realmadrid,3cfiq1,KingJamesX,11,Tue Jul 7 14:58:56 2015 UTC,"he has won 3 Champions league titles. That's 3 more than Gigi Buffon, 1 more than Edwin Van Der Sar and 2 more than Oliver Kahn. I think he should be more than satisfied. Btw, i used those 3 goalies because i consider them the benchmarks in goalkeeping business"
realmadrid,3cfiq1,maysunaneek,-2,Tue Jul 7 19:58:37 2015 UTC,"Sure, he has more UCL trophies than many players to have played the game.   But to think he has only won 5 La Liga and 2 CdR titles over a span of 16 seasons is low."
realmadrid,3cfiq1,KingJamesX,2,Tue Jul 7 20:40:00 2015 UTC,"I think that if a player has won everything multiple times, it doesn't really matter if its 5 or 10 trophies. I honestly think he wouldn't have any regrets. Maybe the boos from the Bernabeu faithful but that's about it"
realmadrid,3cfiq1,KingJamesX,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:24:24 2015 UTC,I still don't get why he was treated so harshly by RM fans in the final season or so. I get that he was in decline but why was he treated so bad?!?!

realmadrid,3cfiq1,MotherDucker95,3,Wed Jul 8 02:44:33 2015 UTC,"My fondest memory was Real Madrid vs Real Zaragoza 2-0 2008 This was a Zaragoza team with some fantastic footballers. Gabby and Diego Milito, Gabi, Cesar Sanchez. He made 8 incredible saves and I said after the game, this man is not like any keeper I have ever seen. That game should have ended 5-2 or 6-2 to zaragoza but Casillas single handedly kept us from losing. I mean there are a million Casillas saves the day, without him the period between 2004-10 would have been much much darker days.  If he leaves, I will truly be sad, he has been our hero for so long, a captain and has won us so many trophies.  I hope he stays, he is one of a kind and I hope the next Real keeper will be like him"
realmadrid,3cfiq1,Masshole3000,2,Fri Jul 10 01:11:50 2015 UTC,"It may not have meant anything in the context that the game went, but that save vs Sevilla in the 3-2 defeat always stick with me just because of how phenomenal it was."

RVP is a malcontent, way past his prime, injury-prone and would likely have stupidly high wages relative to his current ability. I'd take Mayoral over him TBH."

realmadrid,3cff9h,neklos,8,Thu Jul 9 18:38:19 2015 UTC,idek why madrid are not keeping chicha. if he gets enough game time he can really shine. we already see those glimpses of him. And choosing RVP over Chicha isnt the best of moves.
realmadrid,3cff9h,hmurya,5,Tue Jul 7 18:37:29 2015 UTC,We have too many non EU players to keep Chica I think? We'd need to loan out Casemiro again for that to happen.
realmadrid,3cff9h,Bautistav1,3,Tue Jul 7 19:30:54 2015 UTC,Just no.
realmadrid,3cff9h,fjperez12,3,Tue Jul 7 16:23:28 2015 UTC,I hope not.
realmadrid,3cff9h,MadeInMadrid,2,Tue Jul 7 14:56:12 2015 UTC,"I would actually like this transfer as long as its for a low fee, wages, etc. He's gonna be 32 in August and he just came off a terrible season and injury. He'd be great as a rotational player for Benz."
realmadrid,3cff9h,Thor395,1 point,Tue Jul 7 15:54:09 2015 UTC,Wouldn't mind this. Having Benz as starter and RVP as backup. Not sure how well received he will be after that insane header against Spain in the WC.  Although I'm sure this rumor is 100% BS though.
realmadrid,3cff9h,lando786,6,Tue Jul 7 15:00:29 2015 UTC,"I see why people would be mad that someone scored against them, but I don't see why people should be mad AT the person who scored against them. It's the point of the sport, score goals and let the best team win.But I don't think we should get RVP. He's on the wrong side of 30 and takes massive wages."
realmadrid,3cff9h,ISCOREDwithISCO,1 point,Tue Jul 7 17:05:58 2015 UTC,"hmm he's 31 so I'd say the right side of 30 but I see what you mean. As for the wages, it's not like frugal spending has ever stopped Floren.   To be honest I've only seen RVP play in national team games where he has excelled. I'm not sure what effects his age has had on him over the season with ManU. He sure is a solid forward who I'm sure would do great on our team, but since you brought up age, I'm now wondering if he'll be fit to play over the season.  Anyone know if he had injury problems with ManU?"
realmadrid,3cff9h,lando786,2,Tue Jul 7 17:30:59 2015 UTC,He's missed nine games due to injury this past season and 22 in the season before.
realmadrid,3cd15k,KingJamesX,13,Mon Jul 6 23:27:05 2015 UTC,"I honestly had no idea what was in store, but I am so glad he's here. Will probably be my favorite player ever once it's all said and done."

realmadrid,3cbv92,Thebearjew559,-1,Tue Jul 7 05:43:27 2015 UTC,I'm sure that's what marca claims. My question is why would his agent immediately be talking to marca reporters about offers Casillas gets? Seems unprofessional  EDIT: Especially if the agent is divulging exactly how much they offered
realmadrid,3cbv92,dabumtsss,6,Tue Jul 7 05:58:06 2015 UTC,"Marca is bad, but they definitely don't make up direct quotes. That's not only illegal but would also result in Marca losing all credibility. Not even shitty papers like the Daily Mail do this."

realmadrid,3cchd0,Electric_Pegasus,3,Tue Jul 7 06:38:11 2015 UTC,I would say Ibra had the highest chances of moving to Madrid while Carlo was our manager. This is pretty far-fetched and a totally unnecessary move. We do not need Ibra.
realmadrid,3cchd0,R7Serg,5,Mon Jul 6 22:28:36 2015 UTC,"We don't?

Edit: Changed my comment after /u/ado90 pointed out an error below."

realmadrid,3cchd0,Negrodamus07,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:50:53 2015 UTC,"That's because you're influenced by the media a little too much for your own good. Ronaldo and Ibra are professionals and champions not thirteen year olds.   If there is a friction then it would be the good kind. We have too many soft players on this team and it's the reason we haven't won as much as we should have in terms of trophies. Adding a guy who can spark some life and grit into the squad would be a welcome addition in my book. I want winners who care about winning, not guys who would rather be liking posts on Instgram when the going gets tough."

realmadrid,3cb0hc,Kherlon,6,Mon Jul 6 16:49:54 2015 UTC,Who was just released as his contract ran out.
realmadrid,3cb0hc,bozz14,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:19:51 2015 UTC,Still Real could find the backup easily.
realmadrid,3cb0hc,Kherlon,2,Mon Jul 6 19:48:30 2015 UTC,"It's probably with an agreement that DDG is coming soon. Highly doubt, as incompetent as some of the moves made by this club have been, that they'd sell Iker without having DDG already confirmed."
realmadrid,3cb0hc,bozz14,2,Mon Jul 6 15:02:48 2015 UTC,Idk man. I am still worried united will pull a shitstorm
realmadrid,3cb0hc,hmurya,14,Mon Jul 6 15:05:17 2015 UTC,I'd rather keep Casillas for another year and get DDG for free in January. Iker played pretty well last season and most of the goals conceded were not his fault.   I would personally hate to see a club legend like Iker leave after such an awful season. Especially with all the booing and whistling he received.
realmadrid,3cb0hc,itsShady,5,Mon Jul 6 15:44:56 2015 UTC,"I get what you're saying, but at the same time, who's to say he won't have an even worse 15-16 season? he's only getting older  and as much as I love iker, I just can't see him leaving after next season on a better note"
realmadrid,3cb0hc,yenzy,3,Mon Jul 6 16:41:49 2015 UTC,"He's obviously going to get worse every year. Unlike van Der Saar, Iker is short and relies on reflexes/athleticism, which do not get better with age. I definitely think he's good enough to play for Madrid until the end of his contract and he deserves that."

realmadrid,3cb0hc,LessThan301,1 point,Mon Jul 6 15:54:05 2015 UTC,"That is what I saw as well.  AS is reporting Madrid won't let the deal go through, though apparently Casillas likes it.   For me, and I think for many, the problem is this:  If you bring De Gea in, it will be to play.  He will not sit like Navas.  So you lose a captain in Iker.  Man Utd. won't let De Gea go without acquiring Ramos, who is our other captain.    So we potentially lose our two captains, with no clear-cut option to relieve them.  I have heard Marcelo and CR7 discussed as future captains, but I don't buy either one.  Maaaaaaaaaaaybe Marcelo.   What do you all think?"
realmadrid,3cb0hc,phishua,4,Mon Jul 6 17:49:32 2015 UTC,I would not take Marcelo or ronaldo as captains. Pepe is too erratic at times. This is weird. We don't have enough senior players to take up the role. If worst comes worst then Marcelo. But god i hope that doesn't happen.
realmadrid,3cb0hc,hmurya,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:31:47 2015 UTC,"I think ManU will let DDG go without Ramos, because Ramos is not actually angling for a ManU move. He will get his bumper deal, and then it will be down to how hard DDG pushes. ManU either lose him this summer for a fee, or next year for free. Either way, we keep Ramos and get DDG"
realmadrid,3caang,MidSneeze,1 point,Mon Jul 6 09:41:33 2015 UTC,"DDG will eventually end up at Madrid.  If Ramos is looking for money (that he may or may not deserve), he might stay. But if it isnt only about money, we could have already seen the last of him in Madrid.  With Isco its a matter of accepting the squad rotation role and being patient. I think he will stay, as it appears he likes challenges.  Harper its where it gets messy, maybe sell him with a buy back option. But the most probable scenario is that he will play for Castilla. Though theres a few players fighting for that spot in the ""B"" team."

This according to those in here who speak fluent Portuguese, and were nice enough to clarify. Makes sense."

We came into the match as slight underdogs, given Suarez' timely return. The way we came out fighting made all my doubts about our transfers last summer go way. Probably the best thing was to see the Modric and Kroos partnership reach it's full potential. I remember some of the commentators during the game say that this will be the new Xavi and Iniesta combo, given the harmony that they were working together in. From that point on we hit high gear until Modric got injured and then it all fell apart... Can't wait to see them click again next season."
realmadrid,3c9vkc,shhas13,6,Mon Jul 6 07:03:22 2015 UTC,"The first Classico and the first half of the Liverpool away leg. We started second best in both games, but in both games, Modric and Kroos guided us through the rough early stage and got us going forward. I think those two games highlighted how good their partnership was, and how much it was missed."

realmadrid,3c7sb9,biloh,23,Sun Jul 5 18:21:01 2015 UTC,We needed to fill some space in our midfield. Lucas Silva was regarded as one of the best players in Brazil and he is so young. Just because Ancelotti didn't play him doesn't mean he's useless. Same with the other people who think some are useless because Ancelotti refuses to rotate.

realmadrid,3c7sb9,CrAppyF33ling,-13,Tue Jul 7 16:12:48 2015 UTC,"Can we really afford to develop players when we are playing against the best Barcelona we have seen? It just seems like a player we will have to lend out and end up selling. We are seeing with Asier, and saw it with Casemiro. Just seems like Carlo knew the guy was not ready, and we don't have margin for error to let these guys develop. It seems like since we lost Valdano whoever is doing the signings are not thinking short term."
realmadrid,3c7sb9,BroCirus,13,Sun Jul 5 18:30:43 2015 UTC,"The mindset of not having time to develop players is why we have been second to Barcelona for the past decade. It has been a decade of losing, for the most part, and we could have used any of that time to develop players. Wouldn't have made any negative impact as we were losing anyway."
realmadrid,3c7sb9,CrAppyF33ling,-2,Sun Jul 5 19:20:58 2015 UTC,"I don't have anything about in house players that are able to make through the youth system, those are pearls. What I meant was why do we have to get a guy that is 22, has never played a day in Europe and then summer comes and we have talks about Pogba, Vidal and Veratti. It just does not make sense. If we are going to make these big signings why don't we just cut the bullshit and sign the big names who are also young."
realmadrid,3c7sb9,CrAppyF33ling,5,Sun Jul 5 20:06:10 2015 UTC,"The thing is we have plenty, and I mean PLENTY of matches throughout the season where Carlo could have played them to develop them into the team. But he didn't, that's fine that's just his ways right now. If a team like Barcelona can do it, why couldn't Madrid? I mean everybody needs rotation right? But instead of rotating players during a 3 match week, Carlo continued to use the same players.  I think there may have been disconnect with what Carlo wanted and what the boards were doing. Maybe Carlo wanted only the top players so he doesn't lose confidence fielding different XI's, who knows? But hopefully Benitez gets exactly what he wants here so he can start using all of our arsenal."
realmadrid,3c7sb9,CrAppyF33ling,1 point,Sun Jul 5 18:35:39 2015 UTC,"I will give you the fact the he joined mid season where cup matches where pretty much done and he joined a team that was playing the most important games in the year. What bugs me is that we try to go for these young signings and then we ask why they are not performing. These are just young kids who need to time to develop, and if we are doing these signings we shouldn't be firing coaches because they could not win leagues. As the most succesful team of all time we are spoiled with wins and titles- but these come with a high ticket price, we need to spend a lot of money to get players who are already developed, who are already scoring and playing in big leagues. To be honest it makes me sick that they got rid of Carlo because he was doing the best job he could do. If Benitez plays these guys it would be in the cup and that's it. Would you really play inexperienced guys if your job depended on it. I get what we did with Odegaard- but with 21 year old that haven't played in Europe, I don't see the point. And don't get me started on Illara."
realmadrid,3c7sb9,pale_cerulean_dot,1 point,Sun Jul 5 19:12:02 2015 UTC,"Carlo's job is not just a coach, he is the manager of Real Madrid. So yeah, I would say it is fair that he should be putting in players like Silva and Illara more often. If he's not comfortable in using them in one tactic, he should come up with more ideas to bring them into the team. I'm not blasting Carlo out the door, I don't hate him, I just think it's a bad flaw he has not rotating and putting in more faith for the people other than the superstars. Mourinho was more able to rotate with players who were barely stars when he first got them and he did just fine. Hell he beat Barcelona with a B team in his last year here. I'm not really comparing them, but I'm just saying it can be done, players will want to perform for you if you put more faith in them."
realmadrid,3c7sb9,pale_cerulean_dot,1 point,Sun Jul 5 19:34:39 2015 UTC,"I hate to say it but Carlo didn't have a way to switch things up from the bench- all we had was defensive midfielders. Why did we need another one? Illaramendi should have been enough, but no, we got Silva. When Modric was gone I knew the season was not going to end well."
realmadrid,3c7sb9,pale_cerulean_dot,1 point,Sun Jul 5 20:10:45 2015 UTC,"And who's fault that he didn't have a way to switch things up from the bench? All we had was defensive midfielders? We had Jese (who I guess performed a bit poorly, but could have had more game time to get his confidence back from a year long injury), Isco or James depending on who starts, and Chicharito, that's three major attackers from our bench. He could have switched in an Isco or James, or Bale for a defensive mid like Illara and Silva to cover for Kroos and move him up since before Kroos was at Madrid he was an attacker, but he simply did not. He should've tried more things other than try to bandage Modric's hole with Isco/James before the strikers. It just seems like he never had more than one plan going into a match."
realmadrid,3c7sb9,ItalianTacticz,10,Sun Jul 5 21:18:14 2015 UTC,"Lucas Silva is young (22), he was a relatively cheap purchase from Cruzeiro, and he was touted as one of the best young prospects in Brazil. I don't understand how his purchase could be considered a 'crapshoot.'   With playing time, either on loan or at Madrid, he could develop into a Modric-esque player. It's too soon to make any harsh judgements on him, we haven't seen him play enough at a high level in Europe."
realmadrid,3c7sb9,AfricazMost,-3,Sun Jul 5 18:36:21 2015 UTC,"I think this was a more of a Porto signing than a Real Madrid signing. We don't have time to develop these players. Coaches are under extreme pressure and the president does not care about a process, but more winning cups. If we sign young players we must be patient and wait for them to develop, while Barcelona wins tripletes. Just a thought."
realmadrid,3c7sb9,thefreethinker9,1 point,Sun Jul 5 18:45:01 2015 UTC,"What do you mean by a 'Porto signing?'   I don't agree that we don't have time to develop players. By training with the best, Lucas Silva will develop. By getting playing time, last 30 minutes and full games of lesser matches, he'll develop. By going on loan if his playing time isn't adequate at Madrid, he'll develop.   It's not like Madrid are buying a starting XI of developing players and having them all play. You have a few who play and get acclimated to the team and/or league and/or European football. Then some work their way into Madrid's starting XI, and others don't. That's football. I don't see how this prevents Madrid from winning trophies."
realmadrid,3c7sb9,firechaox,3,Sun Jul 5 19:26:58 2015 UTC,By Porto signing I mean an unknown south american player who first comes to Europe.  Lucas Silva can definitely develop but why the heck do we have to sign him mid season to help us out? I think he was never supposed to. The media tried to shove it like it was. To me this was a summer prospect signing and loan him out. We need players that are ready to start. We can't really give that advantage to Barcelona.
realmadrid,3c7sb9,AYSanie,1 point,Sun Jul 5 20:17:13 2015 UTC,"Of course we need players that are ready to start, but we also need players to develop.   You seem to forget that Madrid are not the only big club. We can't always buy the best established players like Verratti or Pogba. Both of them play at big clubs who won their respective leagues last season and who can compete with the best in the CL. The allure of Madrid doesn't attract every big player. That's why we develop players, so we can have the very best in the future.  Do we need another experienced midfielder? If yes, only one who is content not being in the starting XI for big matches - that is, not a Pogba or Verratti. But we also need Lucas Silva and Casemiro and others, so we can have the midfielder that every big team wants in the future.  And finally, how is Silva not ready to start? Not against Barca or Atleti, obviously, but certainly against the bottom half of the table. I wouldn't be surprised if he could perform well against teams like Villarreal or Málaga or even Sevilla. He did against Schalke."
realmadrid,3c7sb9,PhaticusMaximus,1 point,Mon Jul 6 02:36:39 2015 UTC,"I think his point is that we could've signed someone like Kondogbia, W. Carvalho, or Fernando (Shaktar) instead.Who are all at a higher level and they're used to European football and they're all under 22. Not that Lucas Silva can't become better than them, just that they are currently able and maybe even willing to fight for a spot."
realmadrid,3c7sb9,DONT_YOU_DARE,1 point,Mon Jul 6 23:57:57 2015 UTC,"Lucas Silva was voted the best DM in the Brazil in his final season and  touted as one of the best young prospects.  The fact that Ancelotti refused to rotate does not mean that Lucas is a bad player. Everyone was saying Chicharito was crap until given a chance and he proved he was not. The same with Morata, who is not a starter for Juventus.   Lucas will go on loan somewhere and he will tear it up, and everyone will question why we sent him away."
realmadrid,3c7sb9,efarfan,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:02:37 2015 UTC,Lucas silva did play and for the playing time he had he did well but he wasn't top level. Since he is young we should keep him but maybe loan him out to develop. If you want to play for Madrid you have to be top of the top.
realmadrid,3c7fm0,ace-s,18,Sun Jul 5 16:21:44 2015 UTC,"Vidal would be phenomenal for Benitez's 4-2-3-1, and I'm a firm believer we need to support Benitez with his transfer wishes in order for him to build the team he believes he will be most successful with."
realmadrid,3c7fm0,Ceassar,2,Sun Jul 5 18:41:36 2015 UTC,THIS! Benitez does well in identifying players. Let him have it. Let him get the players that work well for him.
realmadrid,3c7fm0,varanermcf,1 point,Tue Jul 7 19:41:41 2015 UTC,"Absolutely, otherwise we may be setting Benitez up for failure from the beginning if he is not afforded the players he needs to find a proper balance in the team with the way he wants to play. In many ways that's what Ancelotti struggled with after the departures of Alonso, and Di Maria where our teams balance struggled all season. Real can't make the same mistake twice with Barcelona at the top of their powers, and another trophyless season can be crippling to the progress of the club we began to make since Mourinho joined."
realmadrid,3c7fm0,Ceassar,7,Wed Jul 8 18:37:40 2015 UTC,"Would've been a fantastic purchase in 2011 or 2012, just like the Llorente rumors, when he was arguably the best all-around midfielder in the world, but I'm against it now. The midfield already being clogged, his age, injury history, not being exactly what the fans want and the obvious off-the-pitch stuff are red flags for me. I think rumor is just a rumor and nothing concrete, but even if it was I'd pass."
realmadrid,3c7fm0,bozz14,2,Sun Jul 5 16:43:52 2015 UTC,"It's tough to say, talent like Vidal should always be welcomed at Madrid. To be the best, you have to have the best. That being said, Vidal's signing can potentially cause havoc in the dressing room. For one, players like Isco, Casemiro, and Illara will have less playing time. Hell, even players like Modric or Kroos can see less minutes. Another part is his out of field antics. Vidal is always in the newspapers for his night life customs. As if As and marca didn't have enough crap to publish; Vidal will give them plenty.  I think he'd be a great signing if Rafa does rotate plenty, if not, its best to keep our midfield the way it is."
realmadrid,3c7fm0,Fonz_c,-1,Sun Jul 5 20:49:37 2015 UTC,I think it will only rotate kroos/modric/vidal. This won't affect isco.

realmadrid,3c7fm0,thefreethinker9,2,Mon Jul 6 20:17:15 2015 UTC,YES! We have lacked balance in our midfield for far too long. He'd fit right in. We need a fighting spirit like him in our squad
realmadrid,3c7fm0,AYSanie,3,Tue Jul 7 01:42:06 2015 UTC,"My opinion:   Our midfield is already packed with great players like Kroos, Isco, Modric, Silva, Casemiro ( he just returned ), Illara....etc  I feel that we don't need him because we already have capable players next Season and Casemiro is a great Defensive midfielder.  Another reason why I'd rather not have Vidal is his temper, I feel that he is going to be a liability on important and stressful games like the Classico"
realmadrid,3c7fm0,BroCirus,17,Sun Jul 5 16:25:41 2015 UTC,"He is a class above casemiro, lucas, illara. Compared to kroos, modric, isco, he is better defensively. He is like a much better khedira. There is definitely a gap in our midfield for a player like him. Whether or not he is the one that should fill it? Up to Florentino."
realmadrid,3c7fm0,whitepoloshirt,2,Sun Jul 5 16:30:56 2015 UTC,We haven't seen Casemero and Silva play yet and they are both very young. Buying more midfielders will just Halt their progress and growth.  My personal opinion is that we should focus on improving what we have instead of buying more players.
realmadrid,3c7fm0,demonofthefall,5,Sun Jul 5 16:35:44 2015 UTC,"After seeing lots of players come and go from our team, unfortunately time is not something you have when you're playing for Real except if you're a special purchase."
realmadrid,3c7fm0,Thebearjew559,1 point,Sun Jul 5 17:10:18 2015 UTC,I really don't know what this sub see in Casemiro. He shouldn't really be mentioned on the same sentence as Vidal.  source: live in Brazil.
realmadrid,3c7fm0,Demmitri,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:02:17 2015 UTC,Vidal would probably be useful but I wouldn't pay any attention to these 'rumors'. There were a TON of rumors about Ramos leaving and the ratio of rumors to ones that actually come true is extremely small
realmadrid,3c7fm0,Alopolis,1 point,Sun Jul 5 16:40:51 2015 UTC,My hate for Vidal is equal of my hate for Diego Costa. Imagine how would you feel if we sign Diego Costa...
realmadrid,3c7fm0,Bustamente20,0,Mon Jul 6 09:28:12 2015 UTC,"We don't need him IMO. Whilst he's very good defensively, he's also more of a box to box midfielder. He's more similar to Khedira than Xabi Alonso for instance. If we are going to sign a defensive midfielder, it needs to be one who is willing to sit and hold in front of the defence. I don't think Vidal is that guy."
realmadrid,3c7fm0,san767,0,Sun Jul 5 18:32:46 2015 UTC,Kroos the holding mid with both Modric and Vidal committing defensively would work quite well

realmadrid,3c62qg,fansgesucht,3,Sun Jul 5 08:11:42 2015 UTC,"I have two pairs of tickets, too. Looking to sell one set, but I'm having a difficult time deciding which one to keep..  Both are on the lowest tier, one in M23, pretty much in platinum area, but standing room and side view of pitch, and the other is in M4, in the RM active area..  I'm also going to the Roma game, sitting in Q21 near the back, which is side of the pitch, so I'm leaning towards active area.  Any ideas which area will have the best atmosphere?? I was going to just go to the Roma game and see what it's like in the two areas then see if I can sell them in 6 days..   I'M SO EXCITED!"
realmadrid,3c62qg,0lllllll0,3,Sun Jul 5 12:48:35 2015 UTC,"Hmm it's tough, because the atmosphere really depends on the surroundings. This isn't the best advice, but having been in the KOP for the Liverpool v Norwich match (suarez 4 goal stunners from half way) and then In the middle of stanford bridge with amazing view, i found the KOP seats a billion times more amazing, because of the atmosphere and chants etc.... but i may be bias as i am a scouser.  But the MCG will be packed, and i think its honestly up to you. If you want to be apart of the non stop chants, go the RM AA if you want a nicer seat, take the Plat-side seats.  Either way the game and experience will be amazing."

Gonzalo may have been a better striker against smaller teams, but all things considered, Karim was/is the better player for us. Link up play, situational awareness,  and big game delivery all fall in his favor."
realmadrid,3c5qy4,RyzinEnagy,22,Sun Jul 5 03:19:51 2015 UTC,"Plus Benzema also had a habit of bottling it under pressure then and missing plenty of sitters.  He's better now than when he was competing with Higuain.  In hindsight we made the obviously correct choice, thankfully."
realmadrid,3c5qy4,Electric_Pegasus,-29,Sun Jul 5 03:47:26 2015 UTC,"Not really Benzema has added nothing to Madrid's trophy cabinet. We have Ronaldo to thank for carrying the attack. On the flip side we probably win the league last year if Pipita is still with the team.  EDIT: at least respond instead of downvoting for opinion...  Benzema is the biggest fraud in Madrid's history. He should thank his lucky stars he gets to play with Cristiano who can carry the load when he goes missing for months offering nothing except his ""link up"" which doesn't actually translate into victories and trophies."
realmadrid,3c5qy4,KingJamesX,8,Sun Jul 5 07:08:30 2015 UTC,"I know i would get downvoted too but i am not pleased at all with Benz's finishing skills. Yes, sometimes he's great but last season, he missed so many sitters"

All those guys left because they (understandably) couldn't handle being second in the pecking order... in Fideo's case he was looking to get paid."
realmadrid,3c5qy4,Hamad68,11,Sun Jul 5 16:43:20 2015 UTC,against small teams yes... I can't remember the last time he scored against a big team.. he scored against barca in the super cup couple of years ago but after missing like 4 chances.. he doesn't seem to struggle against smaller teams tho.. While Benzema is the complete opposite.. he kinda struggles finding the back of the net against small teams but is perform 100% against big ones.. especially clasicos.. cant remember the last time he had a bad clasico tbh..
realmadrid,3c5qy4,sav86,1 point,Sun Jul 5 02:43:41 2015 UTC,I don't think he's ever had a bad clasico...Benz is actually more likely to score against Barca then any other club. I almost always expect him to bring a goal or assist to a goal during a big match.
realmadrid,3c5qy4,TGI_Martin,8,Mon Jul 6 08:56:42 2015 UTC,"I favored him over Benzema.  Forgive my memory, but if i recall correctly Higuain was a true striker; he was always looking to poach and score.  Benzema plays a little further back, and facilitates as much as he shoots."
realmadrid,3c5qy4,RMstreamer,2,Sun Jul 5 02:44:14 2015 UTC,A lot of people actually. It was definitely not true.
realmadrid,3c5qy4,joevaded,2,Sun Jul 5 02:52:48 2015 UTC,"It depends. It's like comparing Cristiano Ronaldo to Quaresma.   They both were forwards, Higuain managed great scoring runs, Benzema was a better link up player. That helped him score against big teams who would triple up on Cris but he used to miss a lot of sitters.   Higua was more clinical but mainly against medium to small teams. UCL wise? Benzema was better. League wise, Higuain. Smaller teams would converge on Cris and congest the box and a sure finisher was needed - for a while, Pipa was that.  I think the biggest advantage Benzema had for staying was his relationship with Cristiano. Something Higua lacked.  The best description of the two was made by Mourinho: together they would be the perfect forward. Sadly, they aren't."

Higuain was not made for the Champions League."
realmadrid,3c5qy4,Serverloco,-6,Sun Jul 5 03:21:32 2015 UTC,What did Benzema do exactly that helped us win La Decima??? It was Ronaldo who scored 17 goals and Ramos who stepped up in the semis/final. We win that trophy even without Benzema.

Benz could have gone the whole knockout stage without scoring or assisting, but maybe he had one pass in a buildup to an important goal.

realmadrid,3c5qy4,wavetoyou,1 point,Sun Jul 5 14:20:32 2015 UTC,"This inevitably is going to boil down to a Benzema vs Higuain comparison...but they're two different players. Higuain was a better out-n-out striker where you had confidence he could put one in the net, whereas Benz was the play maker, the false 9 that sets up the plays and gifts the goals. I prefer Benzema (bias) because le french, but you really can't compare the two. Florentino didn't see the need to have Gonzalo when you have Ronaldo who can score double figures five times over in a season."
realmadrid,3c5qy4,punkfusion,1 point,Mon Jul 6 09:04:59 2015 UTC,"Here's my take on it. Neither Benzema or Higuain were true #9 in my opinion. Both score in a myriad of ways, but neither had that ""knack"" or instinct for sniffing out the scoring opportunities that a true striker was able to. I've received some backlash for this opinion, but I honestly feel it's the case. Both want to do the amazing, sacrificing the easier opportunities, and also mucking up said easy opportunities. Higuain more so than Benzema, as Karim is at least able to link up in attack with teammates a lot better (can play distributor).  Higuain was an attacker who would disappear in big moments, as others have suggested. He would also miss some would-be easy opportunities that left you scratching you head, but score goals that left you amazed and thinking, ""why would he even try that?"" At times, he would be unable to link with other players on the attack, opting instead to try and score from low percentage positions instead of making the right play. I, personally, think this happened more and more often because of the criticisms he received for not being an instinctual scorer. But, in football, there's certain plays that just seem like the right play...and I found Higuain more often than not, unable to discern between what he should do for the overall betterment of the team. I think Higuain is the perfect forward for a team like Napoli, but not quite enough to keep those at Real Madrid satisfied. This is, afterall, the biggest football club in the world.  This has been another unprofessional opinion, by /u/wavetoyou."
realmadrid,3c5qy4,FluidMechanics77,1 point,Mon Jul 6 14:35:57 2015 UTC,"Higuain was a brilliant striker who managed to score alot of goals for Real Madrid. He brought me memories that really stuck with me.  People have said he cracks under pressure but I think not, I just think his scoring against larger teams was low, which i completely agree. But he has scored the important goals when the chips were down. In his first 6 months here, Higuain comes on and scores the 4-3 vs Espanyol, the goal that probably won us the title(though there were many goals like that in the 06-07 season), 07-08 he scored vs Osasuna, it was not super important, we would have won laliga either way but it made Barca do the guard of honor for us.  In the 08-09 season, while everyone else was shit, Higuain was a star and managed to score the most goals. 09-10 Higuain was again among the top scorers, 10-11 consistent goalscorer, 11-12 part of one of the best trident of scorers ever, then 12-13 form dips and he is transferred to Napoli for a fair fee  Lets be real here, he did alot of hunting for us and was brilliant when we needed him to be. I attribute some of my favorite Real moments to him"
realmadrid,3c5qy4,Electric_Pegasus,0,Wed Jul 8 18:47:25 2015 UTC,HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA.  jk (kinda). I personally always shat on him because he would miss simple sitters at the most crucial points during games. He did give us a La Liga vs Ossasuna though a few years back.

realmadrid,3c42iu,RM_Official_Thread,19,Sat Jul 4 16:01:29 2015 UTC,"I know this might be harsh, but he was my biggest disappointment this season. His temper in the preseason and early versus Atleti set the tone and he never reached the two-way heights from last season IMO. Not enough impact on offense, too spotty on defense from someone I thought was going to solidify his place as a top-3 RB in the world. I still think he's got a long career at this club ahead of him, but I think he should be really worried about his starting role with Danilo coming in given the latter's 14-15 campaign and potential.   Hoping it was just a sophomore slump and he returns to the 13-14 form and builds on next season."
realmadrid,3c42iu,bozz14,7,Sat Jul 4 16:04:28 2015 UTC,"I feel that he's wildly inconsistent. He can have very good games (Against Barca at home, Neymar was in his pocket for pretty much that entire game).  But, at the same time, he can also have really poor games too (away vs. Celta Vigo, when Nolito was going past him like nobodies business.)  I feel he's decent as a player, really good as a deffender in a line 4 where he can contain a winger, but he's poor 1v1).   Overall, I think he's decent with a lot of potential to grow. But at the same time, I'm biased as he's a Spanish La Fabrica product. Also I'm a fullback myself, also he's got a sweet beard."
realmadrid,3c42iu,Griff4065,14,Sat Jul 4 21:18:38 2015 UTC,"IMO he was one of our most consistent players overall, and he was extremely important. He wasn't flashy or anything, but he was truly the workhorse on the team and it seemed like he was always putting in a shift. I loved his passion, and I think he could be a future captain if he manages to stay.  That being said the future is a bit of a question mark now that Danilo (discussion for transfers will be at the end of the off season so don't worry) has arrived. Both of them are the top young right backs in the world, and it will truly be a battle for minutes. This is obviously something we have seen with coentrao and Marcelo over the years, and I think this gives them more freedom to run for 90 minutes and not get scared because they can rest. Benitez has heavily mentioned that there will be more rotations in the squad, so I wouldn't be worried about either not playing"
realmadrid,3c42iu,ChedduhBob,2,Sat Jul 4 16:07:20 2015 UTC,"I love Dani. He's a quality player and the only complaint I have about him, which others have pointed out here, is that he is inconsistent. This isn't something that bothers me too much, it just means he needs to focus for a full 90, which is imaginably achievable since he has been focused for full 90 minute games in the past, he just needs to be consistent with those performances.  Attacking wise, I think he's great. He is stronger going forward than he is defensively, even if he doesn't provide a key pass or assist, he opens or spreads the entire field up. Something which Marcelo also does but on the left hand side. Difference is that Marcelo is more dangerous than Dani while going up. Providing those goals, assists, and key passes on a more regular basis.  He needs to cool his temper down. Hopefully that'll go away as the years progress because I really do enjoy him. I remember watching him in pre-season during Carlo's first year and thinking ""He's not ready. He should have stayed in Germany."" but I do think he is ready. I hope to see Dani become a Real Madrid legend as long as he stays; he has the type of energy and spark that is needed in high pressure games that other teammates can feed off of."

realmadrid,3c2ivh,Tigriski,5,Sat Jul 4 04:29:38 2015 UTC,This. Verratti would be a smarter buy although a highly unlikely Transfer to happen. Vidal would be a good choice as well. My Fear is If Kroos Moves up we lose a midfielder in Modric or Isco. And i dont think my heart can deal with that kind of loss. My heart's still shattered from Ozil's transfer :'(
realmadrid,3c2ivh,TKMania,3,Sat Jul 4 04:42:21 2015 UTC,"True ... TBH i dont want any of real madrids starting 11 players sold or benched. A new midfielder acquisition is definitely going to do that. But we do need a defensive minded midfielder, so if it was an either or of Modric and Isco. Who would you rather be sold?  Modric is 29 has only a few years ahead of him at top level whereas Isco is an amazing talent and young"
realmadrid,3c2ivh,Lobby_Fleigh,1 point,Sat Jul 4 05:32:38 2015 UTC,"Between the two, I would rather have Modric. You saw how his absence was the reason we dropped points when he became injured. Modric makes the team click."

I sound like a spoiled brat but I think RM could dish out that kind of money."

Drink driving, brawling...no.   We're in a difficult adjustment period right now, new manager etc, everything needs to be about a smooth transition and cohesion, bringing someone like that in might pull the managers focus if they're worried about their behavior/there are ""incidents"" off field that need dealing with. Also, given the discipline level of some of our players and the overall jovial temperament of the team, someone like that could bring some dressing room issues.

realmadrid,3c1uwk,KiraXY,9,Sat Jul 4 00:31:45 2015 UTC,Nope. I'd rather agree personal terms and a contract to sign him next year on a free transfer basis as he (allegedly) doesn't want to continue at Manchester United. This is something very popular with Bayern Munich with players like Pizarro and Lewandowski. With the money saved I can give Ramos a well deserved raise.
realmadrid,3c1uwk,SergioSammut,2,Sat Jul 4 00:22:13 2015 UTC,What do you think about the Ramos situation? Do you think it's all for a new contract or does he really want to leave?
realmadrid,3c1uwk,jmanjumpman,4,Sat Jul 4 01:25:50 2015 UTC,"I think like Sid Lowe said it's more than the money here. Ultimately though, I feel money answers all things and would persuade him to stay. United understandably Is playing hard ball because they need to show some backbone in the transfer market and not give the perception that they aren't one of the absolute top clubs. Real needn't let it be taken too far. They've shown they'll be tough now let us show we'll be smart and wait a year for De Gea."
realmadrid,3c1uwk,hadesflames,1 point,Sat Jul 4 01:57:09 2015 UTC,"It's a shame that De Gea wants to leave us but, it's understandable for him to want to go back to Madrid and I'm ok with him leaving us to join Madrid and not some EPL club"

In that case, I'd rather go somewhere to begin with.   Meaning if I'm a player, and I have offers from Inter, Man U and PSG. (Example) I wouldn't go with Man U out of those 3 because then if I decide to leave, they might do some shit like this and force me to be stuck with them. So fuck that. If Man U becomes less attractive for good players to go to, then no it doesn't matter if they have a shit ton of money, they just lost reputation over 20 million pound."
realmadrid,3c1uwk,BroCirus,2,Tue Jul 7 23:54:57 2015 UTC,The Ramos situation is a masterclass on how to use the media to get what you want (deserve). My gut feeling is that they'll meet in the middle.

realmadrid,3c1uwk,GobbusterMX,2,Sat Jul 4 11:18:40 2015 UTC,"United fan here. Neither clubs' fan base really want to lose DDG or Ramos. And in case we lose DDG it would make things better if we got Ramos in return and vice-versa.   Both players' are arguably the best in their positions at the moment. So both hold a lot of transfer value. In my opinion it would only be worth it for United if we got Ramos with a straight swap or for the same transfer value as DDG. Main reasons are, Ramos is 27, so he is at his peak but I could be wrong. He seemed to get along well with Ancelloti and with him gone, he might be dissatisfied with the club's decision. And possibly the wage demands that RM aren't willing to fulfill at the moment.   Now, while goalies don't go for the same high transfers as outfield players, DDG is really young and still has his whole career in front of him with lots of room to improve. He does only have a year left on his contract so that doesn't favor united. He's Spanish, so that might be a plus for RM. And very rarely makes mistakes nowadays."
realmadrid,3c1uwk,Melobyrro,1 point,Mon Jul 6 05:11:47 2015 UTC,"No. De Gea, despite being one of the best GK's right now, has one year left on his contract while Ramos has 2 or 3. Ramos is considered by many as one of the best CB's right now.   I'd be pleased if we swapped Ramos for De Gea + 20 million; just enough to go and buy Laporte and have him as part of our defensive rotation while he gets more experience and Pepe grows older (one season)."

I sold Arbeloa, Illara and Khedira, and I loaned out a shitload of players (because of my youth academy and reserves).  Overall I tried to keep the roster a bit more realistic because I didn't want to be benching too many world class players, but I couldn't resist bringing in Reus and Verratti. I left out Alaba because having Marcelo and Alaba would be over kill. I brought in Gaya at 71 rated for $5 mill and he's 77 now. Still have Coentrao (now at 81 rated), thinking about offloading him for a good price ($20 mill+). Brought in De Gea because of this, love all the keepers so I have no idea what i'm gonna do.

In fact I have about $150 million sitting there doing nothing, and eventually once I get more money when the season ends it resets and I go back to around $110 million."

realmadrid,3bzd84,Bombuhclaat,1 point,Fri Jul 3 15:12:43 2015 UTC,"Some key things:   Reps- target between 5-10 for building up strength. Once you get to above 10, you'll get more of a cardio effect. I would say do anywhere from 3-5 sets. Exercises- make sure you get the big 3, Squat, Deadlift and Bench. Hit those first, then do some supplemental stuff like curls, hamstring curls, lunges,  box jumps, etc. if you wanna divide it  Diet- probably most important. You need to eat a lot of calories and protein to feed the muscles. Try to make the calories nutrient rich stuff like whole grains, grilled meat, beans, vegetables etc. Fast food isn't the best, but pro tip, chicken quesadillas from Taco Bell are amazing for bulking. Stupid high protein and calories for very cheap.   For a program, do zyzz's splits and adjust reps accordingly. You will get absolutely destroyed though so get ready for the roughest few weeks of your life."

realmadrid,3bzd84,fansgesucht,1 point,Fri Jul 3 15:06:05 2015 UTC,"Not sure, in Ancelotti's system Ramos is not given much protection and this was more magnified last season in particular because of the lack of strong defensive presence in midfield. Marcelo pushes up a lot and this leaves Ramos with more space to cover on his left in comparison to Pepe who has Carvajal who does not push up as frequently(still pushes up quite a bit). Not much centre-backs out there can defend as well as him in that sort of situation, the only positive of Ramos leaving is that we could get someone who is really good at defending set pieces lol."

His role in la decima and as a figure of the club is blinding everyone to the fact he's holding the club hostage.  Iker Casillas: a guy who brought us league titles and several Champions League titles, club captain, club legend, legend of futbol itself, a homegrown product, knows no life other than the Real Madrid life; the kind of player they talk about in the documentary they make 50 years from now. We could say he caused a similar media/club disruption.  He just wanted to be on the field, to exercise his skills at a sport he's played and loved his whole life. Was he wrong or right to want that? Don’t know, not the point. His reasoning was a desire to play; could have sat on the bench and collected his checks. How is he treated? He gets thrown under the bus, insulted, backs turned on him. All because he wanted to PLAY for his club.  Sergio Ramos, who plays every minute he can stay healthy, is out here holding the club hostage for MONEY. RM has offered him an increased wage, but he wants more. He has the opportunity to stay at a club he supposedly “loves”, a club where there was a very high chance of being the next captain, a club that took him from a naked boy on the cover of a magazine to one of the top players in his position. It’s pathetic. Do you all think Casillas couldn’t have made a higher salary somewhere else? When he was the best GK in the world? He loved the club (not so sure anymore because of how he has been treated), but this Sergio Ramos guy? It’s just money. How is he treated? Like a martyr and a hero. Makes no sense.  Honestly? I already see a blessing in Sergio Ramos leaving. This means that Varane won’t feel slighted at being third choice CB anymore. We get to make our brightest defensive prospect a whole lot happier and hopefully build up some cache for when other big clubs are knocking on the door. So stop defending him, stop crying omg no whyyyy… Let him go give up goals and earn red cards for some other team. Key players leave clubs all the time, and the club goes on."
realmadrid,3bzuk0,BroCirus,4,Fri Jul 3 17:01:25 2015 UTC,"Fair point. Not fair though to generalize that those of us who want Ramos to stay were throwing Iker ""under the bus"". One doesn't equal the other."

realmadrid,3bzuk0,BroCirus,0,Fri Jul 3 21:02:58 2015 UTC,"How do you know that he is holding the club hostage for money? For all you know, that is an agenda being pushed by the board to make them look less bad if Ramos does leave. They did the same thing with Ozil and Di Maria, with all the stories coming out about the things they do in their time off.   Maybe Ramos feels like he is underpaid, maybe the club is actually underpaying him or unwilling to negotiate. Do you know? Is it really that much of a stretch to think that our board isn't treating him well?    Let him go give up goals and earn red cards for some other team.    Oh come on, you and I both know he brings much more than that. Give me a break.   I'm not saying we should pay him 12m a year, and if he can get that somewhere else, he should go. That is a lot of money and he doesn't have too many years left in his career. However, this whole saga doesn't mean that we should just assume that Ramos is the bad guy here. If anything, I am more inclined to assume that our board is equally at fault."
realmadrid,3bzuk0,Aliveatlast,10,Fri Jul 3 19:11:23 2015 UTC,"The point raised is not about Ramos' greediness or the board's agenda.  Ramos is among the top most seniors at the Madrid camp, and to cause such rumors and to promote the alleged United propaganda, true or not, is very unprofessional from one of Madrid's main man.  Can you imagine some hard proven loyalists like Maldini/Totti/Zanetti etc. to name a few, do such a thing? No! These players realized their values, influences and settled their disputes with the board amicably. If an agreement was not reached, they left with mutual consent like Raul, Lampard, Gerrard, etc.  Ramos is just pulling a Rooney here. It looks foolish when your most senior man does it."

realmadrid,3bwnzd,brazenrumraisin,5,Thu Jul 2 19:43:16 2015 UTC,But the Man U gets together on Monday so it wouldn't make a lot of sense to go for just a couple days and be so rushed.

realmadrid,3bwnzd,CorvoBondurant,3,Fri Jul 3 01:20:24 2015 UTC,He's most likely traveling first class or by private jet. The flight from Manchester to Madrid is a quick 2.5 hours.  Not too bad for a quick weekend trip. I wouldn't be surprised if it's just visiting family and friends back home for the weekend.
realmadrid,3bwnzd,ShadowX22,1 point,Thu Jul 2 22:26:09 2015 UTC,De Gea being spotted by the Press at a Madrid airport means he flew via Airline.

realmadrid,3bxj6s,ISCOREDwithISCO,1 point,Fri Jul 3 00:31:31 2015 UTC,Aliexpress.com is where I got it from. After seeing the posts on here where everyone was saying how happy they were with their order I gave it a shot. Got here in under a week from China
realmadrid,3bxj6s,GiantsRTheBest2,1 point,Fri Jul 3 00:34:31 2015 UTC,How was the quality?
realmadrid,3bxj6s,ISCOREDwithISCO,1 point,Fri Jul 3 00:41:57 2015 UTC,Absolutely spot on. Very breathable and lightweight but seemingly durable. The stitching is top notch and the small details of the kit are perfect. The lining of the kit has the breathable mesh with the pink lining. It came in an adidas bag with all the adidas branding on the neck and so on. I honestly am having a hard time believing this isnt 100% authentic
realmadrid,3bxj6s,BokiBoki,1 point,Fri Jul 3 00:46:50 2015 UTC,"The thing is that the real thing is like $110, so unless the seller is a rich or generous man I dont think he would buy the authentic thing to sell it at like 90% off. BUT $16 for a flawless knock off is so worth it. Nobody can tell that its not bought from the official store and im sure it can last years to come."
realmadrid,3bxj6s,BokiBoki,1 point,Fri Jul 3 00:56:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah there's no way it's a real authentic due to the price difference but cosmetically it looks perfect, I can't believe it! So stoked"
realmadrid,3bxj6s,ISCOREDwithISCO,-1,Fri Jul 3 03:28:34 2015 UTC,"Most of the time it's from the same factory but they don't pass the quality control because the patch was half an inch too low. Or they reached the quotas for how much jerseys to make in a day and give to local sellers the extra ones as ""non-authentic"" and they in turn sell them way cheaper since they get wholesale bulk pricing."

realmadrid,3bxj6s,ISCOREDwithISCO,2,Fri Jul 3 00:43:37 2015 UTC,No problem! They make very nice shirts. My only complaint is that I ordered it on the 5th and it arrived on the 25th.

If United cave in and lower their Demands, Get De Gea now. If not, then get him next year for Free. Eitherways, he is a RM player sooner or later. (HOPEFULLY SOONER)"
realmadrid,3bzgf0,kopmadrid,0,Fri Jul 3 13:31:31 2015 UTC,"Just lower the price on Ramos, he will be a United player sooner or later too."
realmadrid,3bzgf0,Camorristi,2,Sat Jul 4 01:03:20 2015 UTC,"Then let him stay for another year and come for free next summer. Put the money saved towards a new contract for Ramos. He deserves the money and I don't buy the whole ""this sets a precedent for other players to wiggle for more money"".   Every player does this. They perform, and get paid accordingly. Ramos has absolutely killed it for ten years and basically handed us La Decima on a silver platter. Plus, United will be punished for their pride."
realmadrid,3bzgf0,CR7_Bale_Lovechild,2,Fri Jul 3 13:17:32 2015 UTC,"United keeping De Gea for another season is worth more than receiving a low transfer fee, that much is obvious.   Ramos deserves one last big contract, surprising how he isn't being looked after as well as he should be."

realmadrid,3bvsea,moklboy,5,Thu Jul 2 17:42:14 2015 UTC,"Dude, you shouldn't be worried at all. I am not worried. We only lost last season because of fatigue and injury to our main players at crucial times (James, Bale, Modric, Ronaldo, Ramos) while they didn't suffer any. Even then, we nearly reached CL final and took the league challenge to the last day."
realmadrid,3bvsea,kopmadrid,4,Thu Jul 2 19:22:09 2015 UTC,"Yea and plus we had a shaky keeper (Casillas is a legend but now his time is over, he should leave as RM's all time great). If we buy De Gea , we really don't need to buy another player. Maybe except a CDM (Preferrably Pogba or Veratti). I think next year we can challenge for the treble."

realmadrid,3bvsea,kopmadrid,5,Thu Jul 2 19:51:35 2015 UTC,"We didn't lose any games solely because of Casillas which just shows how good our attack is. For example in the Champions league final, Casillas' fault led to the goal and Ramos saved us. Take the last RM game for example. We won 7-3 but there was a point when it was 3-3 and Getafe were just taking long shots because they saw how ""Shaky"" Casillas was. There was a time when Casillas was arguably the best GK in the world, but ""Now his watch has ended"". I feel we should have a farewell game for Casillas when he leaves and give him a proper goodbye that he deserves for his loyalty and service to the club."

But yeah i agree otherwise. Haven't seen too much of Rodriguez but I really like Medran. His composure and control reminds me of Kroos' and Lukita's play. I think Rodriguez is similar, playing as a deep lying playmaker or no?"
realmadrid,3bvfpz,StrikerGuy7,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:29:06 2015 UTC,Yeah sorry I was just pointing him out. Yes and no. He played winger for Depor most times but would drift into the middle. I think he would be an excellent versatile midfielder for us. He even drops to help out the defense.  And yes I'm very excited about Medran. Maybe we won't have to buy a replacement for Luka later on as he ages.
realmadrid,3bvfpz,infinite-identity,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:17:23 2015 UTC,"Oh ok appreciate the clear up. Will be exciting to watch him next year if he's still at Depor. Should be a real talent one day also considering he's only 20. I just remembered Hamit Altintop, Mou's signing, who would also play anywhere from wings to the middle. And yep, agreed on Medran; hopefully he doesn't become a Parejo or Mata and only prosper after leaving us permanently."

realmadrid,3buxwn,ace-s,12,Thu Jul 2 10:44:59 2015 UTC,He's fast and average. He's going to be used for squad rotation on the right wing mostly. But is should be interesting to see how he fits the build

realmadrid,3buxwn,ace-s,8,Thu Jul 2 11:01:13 2015 UTC,"Jese is going to be loaned out, he obviously doesn't like the fringe role he has and as an impact sub he's really been poor last season. He needs more game time."
realmadrid,3buxwn,TheGogoy,5,Thu Jul 2 12:10:50 2015 UTC,Jese is going to be loaned out   I highly doubt that.

realmadrid,3buxwn,haripako,1 point,Thu Jul 2 11:20:16 2015 UTC,"I doubt he'll play much but is back primarily to meet the home grown rule in the Champions League. What is interesting now would be the situations with Cheryshev, Marco Asensio and Jese.   Also, I don't understand why we even sold him last year. He played most of the games in the preseason and wasn't anything special but why didn't we just loan him to Espanyol instead of selling? Similar to the Carvajal situation in that sense you could say."
realmadrid,3buxwn,infinite-identity,2,Thu Jul 2 14:36:17 2015 UTC,"He was loaned to Espanyol with a €2 million purchase option. They activated the clause and made the move permanent. However, there was a €1 million buy-back option in the deal which Flo activated. Bit sneaky but he just casually made €1million."

Too good for Liga Adelante but not good enough for Madrid as of now, imo."

realmadrid,3bpq6b,saxonsaxonsax,5,Wed Jul 1 16:07:31 2015 UTC,If we sign a new defender I would rather go for a young defender who has already played in la liga like Otamendi or maybe my staff.

realmadrid,3bpq6b,hmurya,0,Wed Jul 1 06:18:02 2015 UTC,Would be a pretty big downgrade imo. He is too slow and lacks technique if we really play such an attacking style as Benitez promised.
realmadrid,3bpq6b,moklboy,1 point,Wed Jul 1 11:06:57 2015 UTC,Replacing Ramos without it being a downgrade ist next to impossible anyway.
realmadrid,3bpoa7,p41,6,Wed Jul 1 03:40:03 2015 UTC,"He started off well. He was magnificent when Zizou got his coaching license issues taken care of and we went on a lengthy string of undefeated matches, but towards the end of the season when Castilla lost hopes of promoting, like the rest of our defense, played poorly. He's got a good cross on him and he's somewhat solid in defense, but he's not ready to take up a spot in either your bench, nor ours. He's not Man U or RM quality and I'm not sure that Zizou will have him next season.  There was a point where I hoped we could get him for Castilla, but he started playing poorly when it mattered most. So maybe you guys will give him a shot depending on your RB situation. As of now though, there is no way he would see first team action for us with Dani 1 and 2 occupying those positions. He should be somewhat developed at this age, but he's not showing signs of improvement."
realmadrid,3bpoa7,StrikerGuy7,2,Wed Jul 1 15:42:28 2015 UTC,"Thought as much. :/ Guess we'll have to get at least Coleman as clyne is already gone. My heart cannot take another season of Valencia as RB. Anyway, thanks  for the response"
realmadrid,3bpoa7,StrikerGuy7,5,Wed Jul 1 16:18:31 2015 UTC,You're welcome. I tried to be as straightforward and neutral as possible. I really liked him mid-season. Best of luck with Coleman. Pool swiped up Clyne out of nowhere.
realmadrid,3bpoa7,saltbeefbagel,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:46:39 2015 UTC,The forgotten man of MUFC. Doubt he's in Van Gaal's plans at all although he was excellent at the U20 World Cup in 2013. Move probably too early for him.

realmadrid,3bnyop,Camorristi,12,Tue Jun 30 19:09:53 2015 UTC,"Perez made the club a big cash machine. And the thing is he doesnt care about the football as long as he gets his precious money. He will sell everyone and buy everyone to get on the pages of the newspapers which will generate more and more money. Business first and then comes football.  We might win some trophy by luck or coincidence, but as long as he is the president this club wont be at the top of the football world....."
realmadrid,3bnyop,LasDen,3,Tue Jun 30 22:05:56 2015 UTC,"Business first and then comes football.  We might win some trophy by luck or coincidence, but as long as he is the president this club wont be at the top of the football world.....   I agree with everything else you're saying but that's just is a little too pessimistic in my opinion. One season without trophies and everyone is like ""this club wont be at the top of the football world"". Yes, Perez is very business minded. But he also cares greatly about the success of the club. However controversial it was, he sacked Ancelotti because we didn't win any trophies this season. His viscous business antics are what allows our club to bring in the best players and be as successful as we are. Love him or hate him, the man goes for club and money."
realmadrid,3bnyop,golferdudeag,6,Wed Jul 1 14:29:16 2015 UTC,"I have to agree that our upper-management is really weak, compared to some other clubs. We are one of the wealthiest clubs in the world ( if not the most ) but we still struggle to win trophies dispite having the best players and the best coaches.  I am not agreeing with the source completely, but it seems that we have internal issues that need to be solved.   We started the first half the season with an amazing form but in the end injuries, lack of rotations and lack of depth on the bench ( apparent ) resulted us to be trophy less this season but I feel that there were bigger issues involved that we will never know.  The only reason why I have some hope next season is that Rafa has love and passion for our team. We haven't had a madridista coach for a long time.  Barca's current form and stability is scaring the shit out of me and I hope that we don't face any strong teams in the first few weeks until we find our form. Next season will be one of the hardest seasons we have seen in a while."
realmadrid,3bnyop,ace-s,2,Tue Jun 30 20:51:11 2015 UTC,lack of depth on the bench ( apparent )   apparent indeed. Madrid have one of the most complete squads in top european leagues right now

realmadrid,3bnyop,ace-s,-1,Tue Jun 30 22:05:56 2015 UTC,"So is the author blaming the trophyless season on the Di Maria for James transfer? My fucking God.   Also, this is hilarious. He claims Ramos wants to leave because he's 29 and thinks, with madrid, he isn't going to beat Barcelona to any titles for the next couple years. Wow.   He tried to be witty but came off really dense.   Did some research on our author. He's the Guardian's rather biased ""La Liga guy."" Nothing to see here."
realmadrid,3bnyop,normannb,5,Tue Jun 30 19:32:21 2015 UTC,"To be fair, for all his comically sarcastic writing he makes some pretty fucking fair points this sub is determined to have fan-blinders on for.   1):Pérez keeps pissing off the most important resource a club has in football: his best fucking players.   2):Pérez keeps falling out with the second most important resource a club can have in football: good fucking managers.  3):Pérez spends the third most important resource a club can have in football to try to fix the problems he causes by losing the other two."
realmadrid,3bnyop,Rakulon,-5,Tue Jun 30 21:41:40 2015 UTC,"Not really defending Perez here, am I? I just pointed out the idiocy in  some of the points the author makes. He does have some valid points but if by pissing off his most important players you mean refusing to bend to the demands of players who vastly overestimate their worth, sure. Di Maria did not deserve the contract he wanted and selling him was the right move... If Ramos wants to play this game and try to make the club bend to his demands, Flo will rightfully show him the door. Real Madrid is more than just one man. Better players have left and the club has survived."
realmadrid,3bnyop,normannb,1 point,Tue Jun 30 22:26:16 2015 UTC,"Well, you are defending Perez in this one. The whole thing is Flo is the person who thinks he is bigger than the club. We are worth more than any other sports organization in the world. We can afford to pay one of the best CBs in football, our future captain, a fucking Idol virtually anything he wants within reason. What he wants is within reason. What DI Maria wanted was COMPLETELY within reason after the best season of his life.    Vastly overestimate their worth? Are you kidding me? Ramos is irreplaceable. What Liga do you watch? Athletico and Barcelona will murder us. Murder. Us. without Sergio Ramos. The only key rivals we have in the league have treble windows opening up. They are getting stronger. We cannot afford to bring in a player who will arbitrarily be worse than Ramos, because Ramos is the best out there at CB besides  Mats Hummels, AND expect him to just figure La Liga out. La Liga is hugely offensive. You don't drop a new player into that and expect him to prevent MSN from crushing you.   If we want to stand a chance in Camp Nou or Calderon games (generally what decides the Liga title) we need Ramos. So you see, Ramos is the difference between a champions title chance, a Liga title chance, or not for us. Vastly overestimate their worth my ass.  We are just like Man U right now... we build this stupid team around beating random teams but Chelsea just builds around beating the top 4 teams in the league and what do you know, champions. Its nice to build these hyper strong teams who's weaknesses get exploited when it matters, you only need to take the points from the ones in the running and get the rest as it comes.   This rant has gone pretty far so, TLDR: These players and their agents are not overestimating their wealth, Perez is overestimating his understanding of the game because of his ability at running a company."
realmadrid,3bnyop,Rakulon,2,Wed Jul 1 00:20:08 2015 UTC,"Ramos is the difference between a champions title chance, a Liga title chance, or not for us.   Lol. You're acting as if Ramos wasn't present in all those games at the Calderon and Camp Nou.   Fun fact: Some of his blunders are reasons Real Madrid lost a fair share of those games."
realmadrid,3bnyop,normannb,-1,Wed Jul 1 00:32:11 2015 UTC,Di Maria's performance in the final was crucial to winning the Champions League...he DESERVED a new deal. Played the game of his life.

realmadrid,3bnyop,hmurya,-2,Tue Jun 30 21:55:02 2015 UTC,Unbelievably stupid tbh if you assume that Sergio Ramos thinks like that. He has endured worse times at Madrid. We just won the CL a year ago.
realmadrid,3bnyop,moklboy,-1,Tue Jun 30 21:23:17 2015 UTC,"Well, I don't know what he thinks about this.

I feel there are very few players who could actually replace him at Madrid. First two names that come to mind are Thiago Silva and Giorgio Chiellini. Two fearless leaders. I feel anyone else, with the exception of perhaps Hummels or MAYBE Boateng would just be a massive downgrade, in so many ways."
realmadrid,3bm78b,ProsperousLion,8,Tue Jun 30 14:42:16 2015 UTC,Silva is a shadow of his former self.
realmadrid,3bm78b,dabumtsss,4,Tue Jun 30 20:03:20 2015 UTC,Yes BUT Ramos is also getting older and has constant trouble keeping his cool and not getting carded. Is he definitely a legend? Sure. Is he irreplaceable? Not at all
realmadrid,3bm78b,soccertes,8,Tue Jun 30 16:41:56 2015 UTC,"His leadership alone is irreplaceable. The only guy with his skill and athletic ability in the world at central defense is Thiago Silva, but Silva isn't spanish, doesn't bleed white, and is older than Ramos."
realmadrid,3bm78b,fjperez12,7,Tue Jun 30 16:44:41 2015 UTC,"Silva isn't a good leader though. Remember how he kept crying during the penalty shootout at the World Cup? He's supposed to calm his team down, not make them more nervous. And then there's the handball issue, he loves to give the other team a penalty kick in important matches"
realmadrid,3bm78b,LosBlancosSR4,10,Tue Jun 30 16:53:20 2015 UTC,I still believe all these rumors of Ramos leaving all started with his dumbass brother opening his big mouth. If it wasnt for him talking to the press trying to get Ramos that 10 million a year a new contract would have been signed by now. I just hope that he does stays for the love of the club and fans.

realmadrid,3blqa6,hmurya,2,Tue Jun 30 09:10:41 2015 UTC,Something I also noticed was that neither Marca nor AS really reported on this apparently breaking news. Why is that? Did that happen before?
realmadrid,3blqa6,Falkenauge,2,Tue Jun 30 08:02:58 2015 UTC,"That is again something you could take as a positive for both sides.   Maybe they were told by the club that Ramos agent is simply trying to put pressure on the board and that they want to avoid this. But it could also be different.   For example (not really the same, but you will get what I mean) El Mundo and Sport both never reported on the Neymar scandal when it bursted out. Does this mean that the scandal was made up? No, they were just trying to hide something very true."

realmadrid,3bjjzm,ericdavidmorris,46,Mon Jun 29 19:15:32 2015 UTC,"I believe that us fans are partially at fault,  last season we booed our club legend who has played for us for over 17 years, Some of our fans harassed players like Bale and Ronaldo outside the pitch when we were getting bad results.  Before down voting me, you have to look at this way. Ramos wants to sign a high salary contract because it is most likely going to be his last contract of his career ( It can be argued that he is expecting more than he should ) and if he decided to sign a lower contract it would be for the sake of the fans.......The same fans that have booed its players during tough times and struggles.  Some of us weren't there when the players needed us and we shouldn't expect for them to stay when we need them."
realmadrid,3bjjzm,ace-s,9,Mon Jun 29 23:30:02 2015 UTC,"Have to agree. The players should never get booed as much as our players do.  It's ok for a player to get booed every now and then when it is justified (bad decisions, bad form extending a long period of time), but how can anyone explain how a living legend like Casillas gets booed the entire season?  It truly amazes me at how similar these fans are to Florentino. You all complain about how he likes buying new shiny players and gets rid of players whenever he pleases.  How does our fan base look when we get the reputation of booing players out of the team? Think about that."

It won't change the fact that he was such a big part of La Decima and I won't forget that.  Edit: also, I feel like we as fans are too dramatic when it comes to players leaving... it's either a tragedy or a treason, and it doesn't necessarily have to be like that.

realmadrid,3bjjzm,RealMadrizzle,8,Mon Jun 29 23:45:30 2015 UTC,"United fan coming in peace here, I think he's coming to United. I remember an interview with him about his admiration for United and how he likened us to Madrid so there is that.  Also, Madrid haven't treated its loyal players/staff very well, Oezil, Di Maria, Casillas, Ancelotti in recent times and Ronaldo/with Ancelotti's sacking and Ramos/not giving into wage demands. He must be conscious of that.   United are offering big money for sure, we can afford that + we're fortunate that the Euro has weakened as this deal would have cost us a good 5-7M more this time last year.   It'll be interesting as to how this will play out with De Gea. Will Madrid sign De Gea on the cheap now? Will United agree to sell De Gea? I really hope not because we were absolutely rinsed with the Di Maria deal, daylight robbery.   And nothing says Perez than a new signing."
realmadrid,3bjjzm,SureAviator,5,Mon Jun 29 22:30:17 2015 UTC,There is no way Perez will allow Ramos to leave and not buy DDG.
realmadrid,3bjjzm,KingJamesX,5,Mon Jun 29 23:05:59 2015 UTC,"Everything is up in the air, possibly an arrangement for United to keep De Gea for another year for a smooth and relatively cheap deal for Ramos along with maintaining relations?  De Gea is worth about £20M now, only 1 season left on contract and bound to leave so he's worth £20M to Madrid. United want £35M at the very least.  We have no qualms in losing out on money and now, on top of that, Ramos has been introduced as a bargaining chip, United have unsettled a player.  We want Ramos for £29M and he is probably worth a good £40M in today's market. So possibly this is how it could go:  De Gea for free next year, Madrid don't pay £20M for one season and United hold onto him for a year. Ramos for £29M this year, smooth deal, Madrid get 40M Euros for him and a guarantee for De Gea + sign Otamendi.   What is more likely is both moving this window but the above isn't out of the question. Both clubs have an immense amount of respect for each other.   From an outsider's perspective, times aren't great at Madrid. Ancelotti gone, Casillas being mistreated, Bale getting shit, Ronaldo discontent, Benitez the new coach (I rate him but not a star attraction), Ramos wanting to leave AND the biggest problem of them all, a fucking amazing Barca side."

realmadrid,3bjjzm,KingJamesX,3,Mon Jun 29 23:40:19 2015 UTC,Obviously I wouldn't be happy with this because Ramos for a while was who I thought of when I though of a Real Madrid Player but at least he won't be going (If this does even happen) to a club that I don't like.

realmadrid,3bjjzm,pantstofry,1 point,Tue Jun 30 02:19:58 2015 UTC,"All these rumors I keep hearing probably go hand in hand with all the negotiations going on behind closed doors.  I can't imagine Ramos would just ask to leave outright. But, he has a certain contract in mind, he has asked for it, and if it's not provided, then he has the right to ask to leave to a place where he can get it, which is more likely the story.   Ultimately I hope it's just a lot of posturing on both sides and a deal gets done. I actually don't think he's asking for anything all that outrageous. He's arguably the second most important player on the team next to Ronaldo."
realmadrid,3bjjzm,El_Zorro09,1 point,Tue Jun 30 02:20:23 2015 UTC,"Normally I would just brush it off as rumors or contract negotiations, no player leaves Madrid unless the club want to get rid of them. But after the shock departure of Ozil (suppose club didn't really want to keep him), Di Maria and Alonso that all seemed to come out of nowhere, am a little more anxious. He was surely going to be one of the Madrid greats, legends of the club don't leave the club for money.  Imagine the next lot of Cristiano to ManU rumors...."
realmadrid,3bjjzm,professor_rob,1 point,Mon Jun 29 21:03:59 2015 UTC,"If this is true then I strongly believe his relationship with the club will never be the same.  Sorry, but it's time to move on. We've got a future captain in Varane who is already one of the best CB's in the world at only 22 years old!  Life goes on and so will we, Hasta el Final, Vamos Real!!!!"
realmadrid,3bjjzm,jmartinez042899,1 point,Tue Jun 30 00:17:25 2015 UTC,"Varane hasn't improved much in the last couples seasons, no way he is ready to take such a big role with the team. He needs to play as a regular starter, alongside Ramos/Pepe, for at least one more season before he can take a larger role in our defensive line. He's an amazing player, but he needs to get used to the minutes and pressure first, before he becomes our best/most important defender. As for captaincy, I think he's too young to handle the pressure."
realmadrid,3bjjzm,LosBlancosSR4,2,Tue Jun 30 06:46:40 2015 UTC,"He has improved though and even though it's not been much he is still very good!   I agree, he's not captain material at the moment, but that's why I said in the future he will be one.  He may be like what Casillas was to us; a young guy playing in huge matches at a VERY young age. If he stay with us over the years I can see him being the captain.  Also agree on Varane's development, he will develop magnificently alongside a veteran like Pepe or Ramos."
realmadrid,3bjjzm,jmartinez042899,1 point,Tue Jun 30 07:45:52 2015 UTC,I'm in COMPLETE denial. Even if it happens there's still no way I would believe that it just happened. This is my favorite defender we're talking about. Fuck all if I see him in a UTD jersey.
realmadrid,3bjjzm,ISCOREDwithISCO,-2,Tue Jun 30 03:54:07 2015 UTC,"Honestly if this does go down, he will go from one of my favorites to arguably one of the bigger traitors in recent times for us. If he has all this so called ""passion"" for the club then I'm sure the pay increase they have offered him should be enough but of course when money comes up you see the true nature of the player. While he has been great for us in the past this is straight up the behavior of a mercenary, not a loyal club legend, if money is all he desires than he can fuck off to Manchester United. That being said nothing is for sure yet, but if this does indeed happen I couldn't even express the shock and disappointment. A lot of people will be soft on him because he was good while he was here but this kind of BS is something you wouldn't expect of a ""loyal"" player."
realmadrid,3bjjzm,Foxtrot68W,2,Mon Jun 29 21:03:36 2015 UTC,"I think he's going to be remembered as one of the greats, without him there is no Decima. There is only a disappointing shutout loss to our Madrid rival. He's a hero."
realmadrid,3bjjzm,recuringhangover,-2,Mon Jun 29 21:18:36 2015 UTC,"""sources""  This is the transfer saga of the month, and the media are going to rinse it."
realmadrid,3bjjzm,Alopolis,11,Mon Jun 29 19:53:51 2015 UTC,"Eh, Sid Lowe is one source and he's more than reliable."
realmadrid,3bjjzm,Alopolis,-2,Mon Jun 29 22:00:19 2015 UTC,"At this stage it's all rumours. This sort of thing happens every summer. One player gets linked to another club and it just goes back and forth all summer. One day a transfer is agreed and the next the player has signed a contract extension with his current club.  I've become increasingly sceptical of these people are there ""sources"". Even if this source is true and that Ramos has said he wants to leave. It doesn't mean a transfer is agreed and there is nothing we can do to change his mind. There's still a long way to go."

realmadrid,3bjjzm,jilb94,4,Tue Jun 30 00:07:27 2015 UTC,Exactly one of the reasons he might wanna leave. Jeeez be patient with the players and understand you might not know everything there is to know before you call him son of a bitch. Look at how Liverpool said goodbye to Gerrard and look at how Madrid treated casillas this season which might've been his last.

Plus, he is one of the two best central defenders in the world. It is way tougher to find a elite central defender than it is to find a good keeper (We have two)."
realmadrid,3bjmjx,fjperez12,1 point,Mon Jun 29 20:21:05 2015 UTC,"Curious, who is the second?"
realmadrid,3bjmjx,Friendofabook,0,Wed Jul 1 07:40:12 2015 UTC,Central defender? Silva. Keeper? Keylor and Iker.
realmadrid,3bjmjx,fjperez12,3,Wed Jul 1 12:12:52 2015 UTC,"Pique has had his arguably best season in his carreer. He is also a very big reason behind Barca winning the infamous tripple. A bit annoyed how he is always left out, he clearly has been the second best defender imo if not the best. The best one defensively at least, not offensively maybe."
realmadrid,3bjmjx,Friendofabook,0,Wed Jul 1 13:01:59 2015 UTC,"Pique is in the second tier for sure. He isn't as good as Silva or Ramos and he isn't even close to being as consistent. He is good with his feet and helps get Barca's attack going, but isn't as athletic or dynamic as Ramos. He has so many up and down years. He usually looks his best when Ramos is next to him for la roja (Besides this year).  Edit: Please don't misunderstand me. I think Pique is a fantastic player. I like him and support him when he plays for la roja (Although he says some things I don't agree with from time to time). I just don't think he is as good as Ramos."
realmadrid,3bjmjx,fjperez12,-17,Wed Jul 1 13:11:01 2015 UTC,Ronaldo is the heart and soul of the team. But I see what you are saying.
realmadrid,3bjmjx,robak69,7,Tue Jun 30 00:37:50 2015 UTC,"I disagree. I believe the footballing style and the tactics are Ronaldo centered but when it comes to bleeding white Ramos takes the cake! When you think of Real Madrid you may think of Ronaldo because of his footballing greatness, but you think of Ramos and Iker (don't get me wrong, they are also great) because of their love, dedication, and commitment to the club!"
realmadrid,3bjmjx,Thor395,0,Tue Jun 30 01:12:29 2015 UTC,Why is he asking for a transfer if he bleed's white?
realmadrid,3bjmjx,Fibonacci_,5,Tue Jun 30 01:55:23 2015 UTC,"Regardless of how much you love a club, you shouldn't let the club take advantage of you! He deserves the pay raise and if the club doesn't respect his contribution then he has every right to move!"
realmadrid,3bjmjx,Thor395,-1,Tue Jun 30 11:19:18 2015 UTC,"You mean he puts his body on the line, which, tbh, is his bleeding job. Ronaldo's job is to score glorious goals because he's the poster boy. Don't confuse profession with loyalty."

realmadrid,3bjmjx,kopmadrid,6,Tue Jun 30 01:51:13 2015 UTC,Sergio stays.  Start Iker and wait until next year for DDG.
realmadrid,3bjmjx,UnlimitedFoxes,10,Mon Jun 29 20:47:36 2015 UTC,I say start Navas. Once Iker breaks Raul's record I think he's gone.
realmadrid,3bjmjx,ISCOREDwithISCO,-3,Tue Jun 30 04:10:16 2015 UTC,"Keep Ramos. Keep Iker and Navas. Get DDG free next year. Iker and Navas play this season, Iker and/or Navas leaves next season. This won't happen though.   Manutd loses money. Mendes loses money. Seems hard to believe Man United will take no money and an older Valdez and an uncertain market over 40m right now.   Mendes and Manu will make money, DDG will leave with a year on him."
realmadrid,3bjmjx,joevaded,10,Mon Jun 29 19:47:32 2015 UTC,"United fan here. I think you are vastly overestimating how important securing that 40m is to us. Since Sir Alex left, we have vastly underachieved, this is the first time we have gone without a major trophy in consecutive seasons for 26 years! In the meantime we have continued to be very successful financially, it makes no sense for us to sacrifice on-pitch performance for finances when we have been so dire over the past 2 seasons. It's probably worth blowing the money, at least until we're back on top in England. When big players have been allowed to leave before, we've been in a much stronger position."
realmadrid,3bjmjx,Harolds_Budd,-11,Mon Jun 29 21:48:29 2015 UTC,"Hey there, firstly welcome and thank you for being civil.  Moving on... I think you are underestimating the effect a  player who wants to leave can have on his performance and on the team. There is no doubt DDG wants to leave.   If he is going to leave, and Valdes is still in a position to play at the elite giving Man U a chance to secure a proper long term keeper... why would Man U forego that along with 40m?  ManU and its fans thought DDG would be here forever but pretty much everyone over here knew that would not be the case. DDG was coming. It was just a matter of when and where. The where is no longer an issue as Barcelona is stacked with GKs. The when is now or next year.   For all parties involved, hopefully now. Wouldn't you say?"
realmadrid,3bjmjx,joevaded,6,Mon Jun 29 21:52:56 2015 UTC,"Nope, I don't trust the defence to play well enough for Valdes who himself was in decline before he got injured at Barca. I think that wherever De Gea is next season, he will want to play to the best of his ability, especially if he does want to play for Real the season after. It's perfectly reasonable to expect him to see out his contract if we don't have the expectation of making money off of him, and a strong season could make the difference for how desirable we are a as a destination next summer.  Also, a lot can happen in a season. If you go on to win the league with Navas putting in multiple match-winning performances and he cements himself as #1, is De Gea going to want to go and sit on the bench?   Although he hasn't said a word about the situation, and so no one can know for sure, I think one De Gea's biggest issues with United is how lackluster the defence has been over the past two years. If there's truth in the Ramos saga, then I would hope he would bring some stability to our defence and that could be a game changer as well. I admit that it does make sense that De Gea would want a move back to Madrid but he hasn't been vocal about it and I would have expected him to make a public comment or go on one of those passive-aggressive Instagram sprees that are so popular nowadays."
realmadrid,3bjmjx,Harolds_Budd,-13,Mon Jun 29 23:20:54 2015 UTC,"I don't trust the defence to play well enough for Valdes who himself was in decline before he got injured at Barca.    False. Absolutely false.    Also, a lot can happen in a season. If you go on to win the league with Navas putting in multiple match-winning performances and he cements himself as #1, is De Gea going to want to go and sit on the bench?   You shouldn't comment on Spanish football if you know so little about it. Navas will never be a cemented #1 at a club like Madrid in place of a Roja and proven player in the elite. DDG would never come to sit. If he can do well in a midtable English team, I'm sure he'll be fine in top 3 in the world team."
realmadrid,3bjmjx,joevaded,7,Mon Jun 29 23:26:47 2015 UTC,"That's some grade A pissing there, you've worn the urinal cake down to a nub. If I had a trophy to award, you would be the outright winner based on a stream consistency, spray power and of course, a healthy colour."
realmadrid,3bjmjx,Harolds_Budd,6,Mon Jun 29 23:32:05 2015 UTC,"Not really interested in the pissing match and not really a fan of joe, but he's right about at least one thing (stopped reading once the bickering befan). Valdes was, if not at his very best, undoubtedly in his prime before getting injured. The year and a half leading up to the injury were his best performances of his career."
realmadrid,3bjmjx,BroCirus,2,Tue Jun 30 00:01:17 2015 UTC,"Fair play, I've just heard the opposite from some random pundits and I know Valdes said something about the pressure becoming too much after he let in a soft goal against you guys in the Super Cup. Hope he's still got it!"
realmadrid,3bjmjx,Harolds_Budd,-1,Tue Jun 30 00:31:26 2015 UTC,"Valdes wasn't talking about the game. He was talking about the bullshit politics Barca always gets meddled in. Catalan nationalists, Laporta piggybanking the team, Guardiola/Cryuff/Board problems....  Valdes def still has it. He's a top, top gk. I used to hate him and argue about how bad he was until I actually put the time to learn and appreciate him. You should do the same. I've no doubt he can achieve that level again."

realmadrid,3bjmjx,joevaded,-5,Tue Jun 30 01:18:13 2015 UTC,"Isn't Manchester mid-table? 7th to 4th... Weak defense, DDG holding the defensive fort?   He'll be fine here. Our problem isn't our defense. Its our over reliance on players that made us lose last season and health. We rely too much on Modric and Cristiano. We lost Modric, James, Khedira, etc. for a good part of the season.   Or what are you talking about? Valdes? Valdes played on a team far superior to ManU. Far superior in the last 5 years in fact. He was hurt. He is back. There is nothing to indicate that his form is affected by anything other than lack of playing time.   Why are we talking about urine?"
realmadrid,3bjmjx,joevaded,5,Mon Jun 29 23:37:15 2015 UTC,"Oh sorry, I it sounded like you wanted a pissing contest. I thought we were discussing why United would or wouldn't benefit from selling De Gea this season.

realmadrid,3bjmjx,Harolds_Budd,-6,Mon Jun 29 23:43:36 2015 UTC,"There are no pissing contests between Madrid and men.  And, nothing will shake up regarding DDG and Madrid were he to come or not. Not Navas nor Iker have what the club needs (longevity, nationality and Roja presence)."

realmadrid,3bjmjx,san767,3,Mon Jun 29 20:00:30 2015 UTC,"Except we haven't and both Iker and Navas can play top level keeping for one season.   We didn't lose because of keeping. We lost because Ramos would lose his marks, we have dependency on Modric who couldn't stay healthy and Cristiano who is just one man in an 11 man team.  If Modric and James had stayed healthy, there is no fucking way we'd have gone without a trophy this season."
realmadrid,3bjmjx,joevaded,-2,Mon Jun 29 23:34:03 2015 UTC,"Yup and keep Ramos. That money saved on DDG's transfered can be netted out towards DDG's salary, a Mendes bonus agent fee and Ramos' demands.  But... Perez isn't always... logical about these things. He needs a big transfer.  I'd love foregoing DDG for a year, keep Ramos, get Pogba or Veratti, a new LB, and a youth product."
realmadrid,3bjmjx,joevaded,2,Tue Jun 30 01:15:23 2015 UTC,I don't think we need a LB. Marcelo isn't injury prone and Coentrao although made of glass can do as a sub.
realmadrid,3bjmjx,ISCOREDwithISCO,0,Mon Jun 29 20:04:52 2015 UTC,"Marcelo needs competition though, and Coentrao doesn't give it. Many games where Marcelo was on and many games where he wasn't. Coentrao is injury prone and sometimes he is injured when Marcelo is too and that has caused us points to (see: Essien as an LB)."

realmadrid,3bjmjx,samsam78,-2,Mon Jun 29 21:38:03 2015 UTC,"Which is why they're no where near as good this season? Di Maria isn't even suited to the premier league, its probably been one of his worst seasons because of his injuries and the physicality. And he's STILL has the 2nd highest assist rate.  Ancelotti said himself he wanted Di Maria to stay. I guess your words better than the former manager of the team then."
realmadrid,3bjmjx,samsam78,4,Mon Jun 29 21:42:42 2015 UTC,"Did you watch us play at all? we weren't missing Di Maria. James had 13 assists and 13 goals in La Liga only and missed two months. We lacked a defensive midfielder and our defence was inconsistent. Lack of rotation, injuries, errors from our defence is why we weren't as good."

realmadrid,3bi61g,TetraDax,-8,Mon Jun 29 15:42:21 2015 UTC,"I don't think its that. We have Iker and Keylor, everyone knows we are fine with those two. This season's losses had nothing to do with our keepers.  I think, at least for me, DDG coming will solidify our keeper spot for the next ten years and that is awesome. The sooner the better. Why? Because Iker is waning and Keylor will never be Madrid's permanent and long term keeper."
realmadrid,3bi61g,joevaded,3,Mon Jun 29 15:45:18 2015 UTC,I agree with you. Having a solid long term keeper will be nice. I also like the philosophy of keeping a local keeper.
realmadrid,3bi61g,yeadoe,-5,Mon Jun 29 16:07:29 2015 UTC,Looks like the truth hurts. Look at those downvotes.   Most people don't understand how significant having a Spanish keeper is especially when he is the next Roja starter.
realmadrid,3bi61g,TimeTimeTickingAway,1 point,Mon Jun 29 19:18:20 2015 UTC,"Not to speak about the press - Keylor will be torn apart if he takes Ikers spot as soon as he makes a single mistake. De Gea would be completly fine, he is from Madrid and Spains next keeper, the press will love him, as much as they love Iker."
realmadrid,3bi61g,TetraDax,-2,Mon Jun 29 19:41:56 2015 UTC,Exactly. And not just the press. The Spanish fans too. Spain can be very xenophobic when a Spanish alternative is present or with players from the Americas who aren't Argentinian or Brazilian.

realmadrid,3bi36i,hautecouture78,7,Mon Jun 29 15:20:38 2015 UTC,"“Real Madrid are words that are in my life. Real Madrid means triumph in victory and triumph in loss. Real Madrid is history, it is the day-to-day and it is what will happen, it is endless longing and endless expectation. It is courage, to overcome the rest and also itself, to overcome loss, to overcome victory. Real Madrid is the “at least” of a bad day and the “but” of a good day. It is suffering, it is loyalty and hope. It is Sunday afternoons and Monday mornings, it is something to talk about, something to converse over, it is something to share with many people. Real Madrid is a global idea, something that is worth all the effort. It is Bernabéu and Di Stefano, it is Chamartín and Cibeles, it is the green of the grass, it is pipes, it is cigars. It is smiles and applause, it is tears and whistles, it is joy and sadness, it is throats and voices. Real Madrid is not the goal scored, it is the next one. It is Madrid, Spain, Europe and the World. It is sport and spectacle. Real Madrid is eleven artists and eleven warriors. It is envy and admiration, it is relevant whether you hate or love it. Real Madrid does not leave one unconcerned. It is values and ideas, compromise and union. It is dreams and reality. There is one Real Madrid and there are many. Real Madrid is every person who makes it a part of their life, those who can see and do not stop watching, those who want to see but cannot watch. It is everyone and no one. It is more than football. It is sometimes an excuse and other times a reason. It was monarchy, republic, dictatorship and never stopped being democracy. It was first and it was second, it is leader without being champion. It is sporting heroes and kids from Madrid. It is front page news, hours of radio and television, it is the eternal debate and the nonexistent conclusion. It is, above all, ambition. It is the grandfather we all wish to have. Real Madrid was yesterday, it is today and it will be tomorrow. Real Madrid are words that I still do not know how to express.”  Pablo J. Rivera"

realmadrid,3bgeru,moklboy,7,Mon Jun 29 11:24:49 2015 UTC,"This makes no sense. Yeah, he's decent defensively but he's pushing 30 and doesn't offer anything different from the guys already on this squad. This team maybe needs a bench player closer to Modric's skillset, not someone like Biglia."

realmadrid,3bgeru,CorvoBondurant,10,Mon Jun 29 01:53:39 2015 UTC,"Ah, you just watched a couple matches and already know enough about him? most players have underperformed in la Copa America. He normally performs better for Lazio."
realmadrid,3bgeru,cieldarko,0,Mon Jun 29 05:14:11 2015 UTC,Saw him in last years World Cup. He wasn't impressive at all.

realmadrid,3bgeru,Bautistav1,3,Mon Jun 29 14:50:17 2015 UTC,"He didn't impress at Porto, why would he impress for us? He is good defensively but the technical side of his game is not good enough, Biglia came off a great season for Lazio and the technical side of his game is much better than Casemiro and he is good defensively. Going into the season with one midfielder who is reliable defensively would be a disastrous move and could lead to the same season as the last one if not worse. Biglia is old but we need a midfielder who is good defensively but not limited in his technical ability like Casemiro is, the dream signing would be someone like Veratti but PSG will not sell him without a ridiculous offer. Every single big team out there has that technically gifted midfielder who is good defensively except us and its quite ridiculous. We were playing a centre-back as our midfielder in champions league semi-final last season, shows how ridiculous our transfers are at times."
realmadrid,3bgeru,pien11,1 point,Mon Jun 29 15:06:24 2015 UTC,"I agree with everything you said. Although I think Casemiro did impress at Porto last season, which is why they they took out their option to buy. And is why we opted to bring him back also.  He did not impress hugely, but he was at least consistent. He is only 23 years old."

I am very happy at the best club in the world, very focused and confident that the upcoming year will be full of success"".  Concerning the news that talk of his dissatisfaction with the club, Cristiano stated: ""I have not spoken to any journalist and I will not do during the rest of my holidays, I would like them to stop the false news and leave me in peace.

I know he used to watch RM games with his dad and the plan was always to come to Spain etc etc and being in England was very much his ""prep"" as it were.   Why us? He's not local to the club, no connection to the club, it's because we're ""the best in the world"" and he has said before, ""if you're the best player at Real Madrid, you're the best player in the world"" (or something very similar to that, I can't find the quote, might have been in a video) How many times has he said his primary motivation is to be the best in the world (which I have no issue with, I think it's a wonderful goal).

I think that without the seniority (señority lol) rule that Pepe could be captain.  I wish Cristiano was a leadership figure but it's just not in his personality.  I also think we should try and get Xabi back for one last season or something and he could be captain, but that's the sleep deprivation talking."
realmadrid,3bajzj,UnlimitedFoxes,5,Sat Jun 27 10:51:28 2015 UTC,"I don't think Xabi will come back, he cited that he wanted to play under great coaches in his twilight so that he could learn from them to go into coaching himself. I wouldn't blame him for wanting to stay with Pep over Benitez."
realmadrid,3bajzj,dabumtsss,20,Sat Jun 27 18:43:07 2015 UTC,"I think the captain should be a leader, someone who can carry the team mentally with his strong character. Right now we really lack natural born leaders in the squad, especially if Ramos is leaving. Xabi Alonso was ideal for the job, a true leader.   Arbeloa got the character needed for the job but lost all form and he's not good enough to play. If you saw the video from the dressing room before the CL final you could tell he would be a great captain.  Bale looks like a leader with Wales but he barely speaks Spanish and seems a bit shy here.   Benzema not at all...  Marcelo is responsible for the good vibes in the dressing room. Not a captain material though.  Ronaldo is too self centered. In Portugal he isn't considered as great captain.  Pepe and Modric might have what it takes. Maybe Varane or James in few years."

It's interesting seeing multiple people list Xabi as everyone I know outside this thread who supports Real Madrid pretty much hates his guts after leaving haha.  I personally think Marcelo would be a good choice (though he's not my number one). Every time I've seen him put on the captains band he plays with a little extra, leading by example. I think he's fiery enough to get it done on the pitch and motivate the team but not so much so that he's going to regularly pick up stupid reds and yellows arguing with the ref."
realmadrid,3bajzj,GiantsRTheBest2,8,Sat Jun 27 13:55:27 2015 UTC,Really? Nobody that I know hates Xabi for leaving like that. Most of us just want an explanation as to why he left so suddenly.

realmadrid,3bajzj,alejpaz,3,Sat Jun 27 13:50:17 2015 UTC,"In terms of the product on the pitch, I feel he's as valuable as anyone and more often than not controls the game in all aspects. He's a model professional, never takes a game off and busts his butt for the full 90. You often see him giving directions and he's got the credentials to back up a claim for captaincy.   That being said, I'm someone who thinks captaincy is wildly overrated so I wouldn't be devastated if he didn't get it."
realmadrid,3bajzj,MooseJuice7,13,Sat Jun 27 16:08:23 2015 UTC,"Varane, cause so he stays with us forever.   He can be the best CB in the world and captain of our team in the future."
realmadrid,3bajzj,dekszter,7,Sat Jun 27 11:19:11 2015 UTC,"He actually turned out to be my top choice too, ideally in a couple of years when Iker retires! My reasoning's a little different (not arguing he's good though!)  I think he’s very level, he rarely gets overly angry on the pitch, he’s very competent, he slots in well with his teammates and he’s good when talking to reporters. He doesn’t bash other players, he doesn’t get angry or complain when he isn’t played in first position, and when asks always says he wants to do whats best for the team, that he believes in himself and obviously would like to be playing but that what is best for Real Madrid comes first. That’s what you need in a captain. You need someone who’s going to be able to take the heat of being in the Real Madrid spotlight with grace, be the first to own up to mistakes, and in both words and actions support fellow teammates. I’ve never seen him try and put himself first I guess is what I’m trying to say. He does his job effectively and quietly.   I could see him growing into a captaincy very well. He’s obviously young so that would be an issue, but idk. Out of all of our players I think he has the most potential. He’s only 22 and he’s /already/ so level, you know? He hasn’t been in a leadership role at Real Madrid so clearly it could go horribly wrong, but I’d like to see him try. I think he has the right personality for it and I think we’d see him grow a lot if he had that kind of responsibility put on him.  I've head from some people that they think he's too quiet to be a good captain and I don't really agree with that. Yes, the captain should be friendly with his entire team (which Raphael is to my knowledge, I’ve never heard about him in anything that even remotely resembles a fight with a teammate) but I don’t think a requirement should be they need to be best friends with everyone.  In the end that’s not the captains job. The captains job is to make sure the team operates as a unit. To insure that everyone is on the same page, and to take responsibility if something goes wrong. It’s to decide whats needed (whether thats simply taking hands off because everyone is doing what they need to do already or seeing that something isn’t working for whatever reason and telling your team to fix it). It’s also making sure interpersonal locker room shit doesn’t get in the way on the pitch. I think Varane could do all of these things well.   I also think he would be more involved if he was put in a leadership role. Spanish isn’t his first language, so he gravitated towards Benz (his NT teammate), but I think he would easily branch out if he was put in a position where it was called for."
realmadrid,3bajzj,RockyLeal,4,Sat Jun 27 13:49:06 2015 UTC,Sergio Ramos hands down...or Cristiano so that he shows extra committment
realmadrid,3bajzj,dekszter,5,Sat Jun 27 13:44:44 2015 UTC,Kroos Pepe and Varane.  All followed by Ramos obviously.
realmadrid,3bajzj,Griff4065,1 point,Sat Jun 27 13:46:49 2015 UTC,I wanna hear your reasoning for Kroos! I haven't head him as a candidate yet!
realmadrid,3bajzj,dekszter,5,Sat Jun 27 13:58:21 2015 UTC,"I was thinking about Kroos too. He got the aplomb and gravitas of a captain, if he stays with Real long enough Kroos will be the captain eventually."
realmadrid,3bajzj,dekszter,3,Sat Jun 27 15:13:08 2015 UTC,"We have many players on the sqaud who encourages the players (Casillas, Ramos, Pepe, Arbeloa, Ronaldo) and that's fine, but I think Kroos is the only real cool-headed player who I can imagine as captain. He can make the players on the pitch calm simply with his presence and on heated matches vs Atletico or Barca that can make a difference.  Just my thoughts tho."
realmadrid,3bajzj,KnoxOut,3,Sat Jun 27 14:05:18 2015 UTC,"I've seen Kroos lose it a few times after being fouled, he also waves at the referees for yellow cards and such. There was also that one game where him and Modric (I think?) Picked up yellows for dissent. It was the same game Ronaldo was wrongly booked for diving.  Just playing devils advocate here, I get your point though."
realmadrid,3bajzj,owiseone23,2,Sat Jun 27 14:37:30 2015 UTC,"Yeah I've seen it too, but I think compared to Ramos or Pepe he's usually chill."
realmadrid,3bajzj,wahmeister,2,Sat Jun 27 16:46:06 2015 UTC,"Interesting! That's pretty much my reasoning for Varane!  I feel like I've seen Toni lose it a couple of times but you're right, not nearly the amount as most of the other players on the squad haha."

realmadrid,3bajzj,plsresponda,6,Sat Jun 27 16:47:10 2015 UTC,I thought Carvajal could have the guts to be a good captain but with Danilo coming up I even doubt he'd be a starter.
realmadrid,3bajzj,silent_sae,2,Sat Jun 27 13:00:13 2015 UTC,Carvajal had shown himself to be a little bit petulant and I don't know if he'd be able to keep a cool head in crucial moments.

realmadrid,3bajzj,GiantsRTheBest2,3,Mon Jun 29 04:54:33 2015 UTC,"Not considering Ramos with all the confusion surrounding him.   I would go with Modric. I think that he has the attributes required for the job. He seems pretty cool headed and I don't remember him being involved in tiffs with other players. He is a very crucial player for the team and as he is such a good player so he is also respected by his teammates. He gets along well with others and I would like to see him take decisions at critical times. I also think that he can handle the media well, which is an important part of being the captain of a club as big as real madrid."
realmadrid,3bajzj,TonyCruise,3,Sat Jun 27 15:59:44 2015 UTC,"I want it to be Varane so he knows he's important to us and then he'll stay here for the rest of his career. He's a great leader for France.   I hate that every summer he's going to be linked with a move away, I want him to be recognised at madrid as someone who is unsellable, like muller at bayern, like messi at barca, like hazard at chelsea.   I would be so, so, dissapointed if we lose him to Chelsea or PSG."

realmadrid,3bajzj,meticuleux,1 point,Sat Jun 27 15:13:04 2015 UTC,"Any of our CB's is my first choice. James needs more years with Madrid, but he can be a good leader."

I'm sure he's loved by his team-mates and fans hugely but he doesn't have the specific qualities you want in a captain. Saying that, he's still young and only had a season here, never know how things turn out in the future.."
realmadrid,3bajzj,pien11,1 point,Sat Jun 27 16:15:08 2015 UTC,He's only been a year there I know seniority doesn't count but I think that's a slap in the face to the others that have been there longer and have played better.

realmadrid,3bajzj,LessThan301,1 point,Sat Jun 27 16:58:56 2015 UTC,It's as big a deal as the captain makes it out to be. To the average fan being captain is just who wears the band but to the team the captain is super important because it's who is the person you turn to when shit doesn't go your way or there is a confrontation on the field. The captain is basically the problem solver and the leader that keeps the gears moving.
realmadrid,3bajzj,TimeTimeTickingAway,4,Sat Jun 27 17:07:23 2015 UTC,No captian besides Ramos imho
realmadrid,3bajzj,Altruistic_Raheem,2,Sat Jun 27 15:24:04 2015 UTC,"This might be an unpopular opinion but I really disagree with those saying Cristiano is not captain material. I see him play a huge role in the team's leadership, and if only by his pure talent forces those on the team to elevate their game.   That being said, my captain is Ramos."
realmadrid,3bajzj,fjperez12,1 point,Sat Jun 27 18:30:52 2015 UTC,"Assuming we keep the current squad I'd have to say Ramos; he is a Madridista, he is a starter player and he has the guts to call people on their shit even if they are the stars of the team.   If Sergio leaves I would give the bracelet to Pepe or Varane; the rest of our team lacks something to be the leader: They can't communicate (Bale, Modric, Kroos), they are too self absorbed (CR), they are too young (Isco, James), they are too inmature (Dani, Marcelo), they aren't starters (Coentrao, Arbeloa, Casemiro, Illarra, Jesé)."

realmadrid,3b7v0h,nowimtrulyfree,6,Sat Jun 27 13:16:47 2015 UTC,"Wouldn't be surprised if he was 84 rated or so in the next FIFA making him one of the most wanted CB's in the game. I always felt like he was a hidden gem being one of the fastest CB's, but he'll for sure get an upgrade. The insane part is that he is still only 22."

realmadrid,3b72yf,RM_Official_Thread,28,Fri Jun 26 14:28:25 2015 UTC,"It's amazing that we have James signed for the future. He showed that he is a top young midfielder this season and there was a noticeable gap in our quality when he was out.  Some of our best goals were the little one twos he played with Ronaldo, and his long range beauties.   I'm interested to see where he will play under Benitez, but honestly I think he can play on the wing or in the middle pretty effectively.  Also the JamIsco fanfiction is amazing ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)"

realmadrid,3b72yf,Murrderer,6,Sat Jun 27 11:06:49 2015 UTC,"I would like him to play out wide on the right with Isco in the no 10 role and Bale on the left. I love the creativity this team has when those JamIsco are on the field together. Two slightly different, but equally creative geniuses. We just need some cover to play next to Kroos or Modric at the doble pivot."
realmadrid,3b72yf,fjperez12,2,Fri Jun 26 14:54:17 2015 UTC,Do you mean buy a holding midfielder or have one of isco/james to drop back?
realmadrid,3b72yf,Negrodamus06,1 point,Sat Jun 27 03:06:29 2015 UTC,"Not necessarily buying a new holding midfielder. Casemiro or Illarra can play there, but I'm not a fan of having both Kroos and Modric playing the doble pivot. I think we would get better balance with one or the other on the field next to a def/holding mid and James, Isco, and Bale further forward with Ronaldo at the no 9."
realmadrid,3b72yf,fjperez12,17,Mon Jun 29 12:13:57 2015 UTC,Missed 13 games and still had 17 goals and 18 assists in only his first season. I don't think it's unreasonable to think he might reach 25/25 with some luck in the health department and with a year of knowing his teammates' tendencies under his belt.

realmadrid,3b72yf,hautecouture78,7,Sat Jun 27 23:31:41 2015 UTC,"I was watching DVRed reruns of Real Madrid TV this morning before work and they had a little montage of James' top 10 assists.  What impressed me was that they weren't all spectacular passes, some were just little touches or flicks, but his positioning and awareness of the other players around him was really smart.  He is creative, directing the ball into small spaces and providing lots of goal scoring opportunities.  I hope he can continue doing as well next season and that we hold on to him for a long time, I can only see his talent growing."
realmadrid,3b72yf,Negrodamus06,10,Fri Jun 26 16:04:44 2015 UTC,I loved watching him prove everyone wrong.   World Class player and excellent person.
realmadrid,3b72yf,zeNap,5,Fri Jun 26 16:50:13 2015 UTC,(as long as it is not in a ridiculously negative manner)   How can anyone say anything negative about his first season?
realmadrid,3b72yf,nunixnunix04,5,Fri Jun 26 20:23:06 2015 UTC,"He lived up to and will exceed his price tag in the upcoming seasons. I would love Benitez's new system to incorporate some way to make it easier or more common for James to take longhots. This season, he was tied with Ronaldo for most goals outside the box and his volleys and half-volleys are an amazing sight to witness.  Amazing player"
realmadrid,3b72yf,ISCOREDwithISCO,6,Fri Jun 26 23:31:20 2015 UTC,On and off the pitch he's always making me proud that he's our player. Hope he stays with us for at least another 10 years. He was the highest scoring midfielder in La Liga this season I think. Flawless.
realmadrid,3b72yf,fjperez12,10,Sat Jun 27 23:30:42 2015 UTC,"Creative, functional in different areas of the field, and a great guy off the field. He is a goldmine of a player and a true sight to behold on the pitch. Isco and James are my kind of jugadores."

I was very happy with the team in general (I mean come on, La Decima finally happened) so to see Di Maria being let go and buying James for massive money due to a World Cup showing greatly annoyed me. Never been so delighted to be so utterly wrong."
realmadrid,3b72yf,theWishingtroll,3,Fri Jun 26 20:44:31 2015 UTC,"His price tag worried me at first, but he is definitely one of those midfielders you want on your team.

The apps are watered down versions of their iPhone counterparts and they take forever to load. It's so much quicker to just bust out my iPhone instead.  I do love it as a bluetooth mp3 player though, paired with my wireless beats I can go balls out during exercise without having to carry my phone on an armband/clip or dealing with accidentally pulling out the headphone cord from the jack. That was really the only reason I got it in the first place so I'm extremely happy with my purchase in that regard. I just hope that I'll be able to transfer some Spotify playlists to it when the stand-alone apps roll out."

realmadrid,3b6e6j,brazenrumraisin,0,Fri Jun 26 18:48:44 2015 UTC,"I find it more convenient than taking my phone out for every single text that I feel in my pocket. That way I know if it's important enough to respond to right away. When I'm waiting for an email, it's faster to look it up on the watch. Weather, etc., most things are just easier to do imo.   Also, I work out, hike a lot. It keeps track of everything I do on the road, and it keeps my phone charged longer because I don't take it out as much. I just find a lot of uses for it. Plus I like to wear watches anyway and it's elegant as fuck. I have a stainless steel, 42mm with 3 bands. I'm not even an Apple fanboy either. I just have an iPhone and all the rest of my shit is like, Surface Tablet, etc."

I got two bands for my stainless, the black sport and the classic leather, looks fresh as fuck.  When did you order yours?"
realmadrid,3b6e6j,brazenrumraisin,0,Fri Jun 26 20:09:30 2015 UTC,"Wherein come the apps my friend. Some things completely rely on the phone, yes, but some apps are good enough on the watch to where I won't take my phone out as much. I can't be assed to take my phone out anymore unless it's a text/call that I want to answer privately or I'm at the mall, etc.   My girlfriend and I ordered them at th same time in late May and I have had it for about a month or so now. I just got my Milanese loop band a week ago and I already had the classic leather, as it came with it. When I bought the watch I also ordered the black sport band, and that came first before anything, so I now have three bands. That Milanese band is slick as hell bro."
realmadrid,3b6e6j,GiantsRTheBest2,3,Sat Jun 27 01:36:10 2015 UTC,Can't wait for De Gea to sign and Ramos to renew that contract. Seeing Xavi's farewell yesterday on YouTube makes me feel bad that we might possibly not give Casillas that farewell that he deserves because even though he's done some pretty fucked up shit and hasn't been the captain Xavi has he is still a club legend. Kinda want to see San Andreas and Spy over the weekend. And my little sister has been sick all week with really bad headaches and a fever :( hopefully I can pass by my parents house today and check up on her

realmadrid,3b6e6j,brazenrumraisin,5,Fri Jun 26 14:03:48 2015 UTC,Maybe like a going away match between current Real Madrid players vs Real Madrid legends. That would fill it up pretty nicely and get everyone in a good mood.
realmadrid,3b6e6j,Garboq,5,Fri Jun 26 14:06:20 2015 UTC,"I got a better idea.

Carlos          Beckham - Zidane - Figo          Cristiano - Ronaldo - Raúl  Bench: Hierro, Benz, Bale, James, Pepe   ............ 89th minute: Penalty for Real Madrid.  Casillas steps up to take the penalty - silence in the Bernabeu - he looks calm. He takes a few steps back, smiles, and proceeds to score one of the best goals we have ever seen, unbelievable! - Bernabeu goes wild - He kisses the Madrid badge and starts running towards the fans where his family is, the rest of the team comes and they lift him up - IKER IKER IKER chants -  he then starts crying, thinking of all the memories, all the friends, and all the dreams he accomplished - He smiles - he remembers how hard it was to get there. He feels joy in his heart, the type of joy he only felt when he debuted."

More over, tradition, skill, etc.  The first time I went to an event in Los Angeles with a press pass with Madrid is the only time I broke rules and tried engaging the players. It is very different from Madrid, especially from when the public practices were available... the players would interact with the crowd sometimes, but not always. Even now when I go visit, it isn't the same. I'll go to the game, I always take the tour (it's free for socios), etc. but don't go wait for the players anymore.  But during their tours here, you get a bit more. And the most approachable and patient people were Iker, Benzema and Pepe.  I got to record Pepe interviewing in Portuguese right in front of me and once I stopped recording he left and I said ""um abraço"" and he laughed and hooked it up. I don't even think it was accurately said or maybe he thought I was with the Portuguese press but regardless he was chill despite playing and being tired.   Benzema gave me a shake and hug too and then threw up a peace sign. Iker chilled with my wife and I for a bit.   Mourinho, Zidane, Cristiano, Kaka, etc. just ran passed the press line - which is understandable. But, these little things, like James did win you over."

realmadrid,3b2krb,StrikerGuy7,1 point,Thu Jun 25 21:48:39 2015 UTC,Di Maria decided he was not going to play for Flo the moment he got that letter from him advising him not to play in the final.
realmadrid,3b2krb,aruuuuuu,1 point,Fri Jun 26 06:56:30 2015 UTC,"DiMaria really left with a bad impression of himself. He said Flo said he shouldn't play in the final. Flo really said that if he wasn't healthy that he shouldn't push himself because injuries would be a probability.   If that were to happen then it would've been a bad decision from DiMaria to play knowing he was injured and then further aggravating the injury.  The would've not only hurt Real Madrid, but Argentina as well, playing at a lower level because of injury: remember Diego Costa in the CL final.  Flo was just watching out for him but DiMaria made Real look like the bad guys."

A player who is told to not play in one of the biggest matches of his entire career, what everyone dreams of doing and works their entire life towards, is definitely not something you want to hear especially if it's someone that isn't directly involved with the game at hand.   I totally agree that it would have been a mistake and would have lead to more severe consequences but Di Maria just saw Flo's letter as an insult with selfish interests and you can't blame him."

realmadrid,3b2krb,GiantsRTheBest2,6,Thu Jun 25 18:01:22 2015 UTC,"His agent is trying to land Ramos a better contract, and he's going to get it.   Ramos is one of the few players in this squad who aren't expendable. Deep down, the board knows this and they know that they will receive huge criticism from the fans and the media by letting Ramos go. I don't think they're going to risk it. They'll want to seem firm and will play hardball to set an example to other players, but I think they'll eventually give in to his demands."
realmadrid,3b2krb,Alopolis,4,Fri Jun 26 13:01:58 2015 UTC,"its funny... In matches were its ramos and pepe combo people bash them and blame ramos a lot or pepe. And when Ramos is about to leave ""omg pls no give him all the money he wants"" Ramos is not irreplaceable. We could get boateng, ottamendi, hummels, thiago silva ( sure he is old but he is still a beast + marcelo combo) I feel like if Ramos pushes it too much this going to be di maria situation"
realmadrid,3b2krb,ShiroQ,7,Thu Jun 25 21:17:44 2015 UTC,"In terms of footballing ability, absolutely, Ramos can be replaced. Very few players are irreplaceable when it comes to footballing ability. Messi and Ronaldo imo, are the only two players in the world who are irreplaceable.   I've always disliked the term ""club ambassador"", but that is what Ramos is to Real. He is a leader on the pitch, someone who has played a massive part shaping the history of the club, someone who is a senior player and has been through thick and thin with the club, he's a player who you know will go out there and give his 110% for the badge on that shirt. He's on the path to being, if he isn't already, a club legend. People will always remember Ramos for the things he's done for this club.   Those are qualities that you can't buy in a Hummels/Otamendi or whoever. That is what gives Ramos leverage in this situation."
realmadrid,3b2krb,Alopolis,4,Thu Jun 25 21:43:59 2015 UTC,"While you are true. But its the casillas situation he is a club legend but his ""status"" is causing problems. And the fact that there has been issues behind the scenes because of him and even rumours of him leaking tactics in maurinho era. It proves that no player can be bigger than a club. I mean sure Ramos is great he has been here for many years and has been great but if players are causing bullshit for the club then its going to be the di maria situation.The reason why i am afraid of this is because madrid might want to make an example of him that no player is bigger than the club. At the end of the day Ramos will leave at somepoint retire or to another club sooner or later the day will come. The terms that he leaves the club really depend on him alone. What i am dissapointed in mostly is if the rumours were started by his agent about him joining united and barca. Thats really sad. I dont understand why cant he just go to Flo and say either you pay me this or i am out. At the end of they day no matter what rumours he makes if the club does not want to pay the amount he wants he will be out"
realmadrid,3b2krb,ShiroQ,3,Thu Jun 25 22:07:54 2015 UTC,"Casillas is a very unique situation. Goalkeepers are very difficult to phase out since you've only got one playing at a time. What that means is that when they do start to decline, replacing them can be difficult, but not impossible. The board don't want to be seen as forcing him out, and Casillas still wants to play for this club. I think at this point it's best that both sides agree to go their separate ways, but that's another discussion.   Ramos is different because as a centerback, phasing him out and getting youth in is not so difficult. Rotation is much more common and there are usually two centerbacks in an XI. Ramos could continue to play at a high level until he retires, if he adapts his game correctly.  You're also right about the no player is bigger than the club. Which is what I think the board is trying to prove here. They're trying to send a message to all future players that they can't hold the board to ransom in terms of contracts. The rumours about him wanting to leave are negotiation tactics. It's an uglier side of football, but one that exists nevertheless.   Ramos's agent is trying to do his job and get the best possible contract for his player. Leaking rumours to the press about him wanting to leave is only an effective tactic if the board believes it. It's a bluff in other words. Now it's a question of which side backs down first. Ramos and his agent, or the club."
realmadrid,3b2krb,Alopolis,-8,Thu Jun 25 22:16:26 2015 UTC,People should stop overrating the importance of Cristiano to the team.
realmadrid,3b2krb,dbarond,9,Thu Jun 25 23:05:36 2015 UTC,"I don't think you appreciate the sheer absurdity of the talent he has. The goal scoring numbers he puts up year in year out are absolutely phenomenal. He and Messi have redefined what it means to be the best in the world. They've set the bar ridiculously high.  If Ronaldo stopped playing tomorrow, we wouldn't fall apart, but it would be very difficult to replace him. Very very difficult. We're talking about a 50 goal sized gap across all competitions."
realmadrid,3b2krb,Alopolis,6,Thu Jun 25 23:23:12 2015 UTC,Cristiano is the ONLY player who can't be replaced.

realmadrid,3b2krb,GiantsRTheBest2,4,Fri Jun 26 13:05:25 2015 UTC,"Wrote this in another thread yesterday   It's pretty amusing seeing how many people actually think there's an ounce of truth to Ramos leaving. Ramos is vice captain of both Real Madrid and Spain. Once Casillas is benched or not called up anymore he will be Spain's captain for years to come. Do you guys really think Perez will let Spain's future captain go? Do you guys really think that Perez, the man who did the impossible to sign an 18 year old Ramos for a record breaking deal, will let him go? Unlike the Di Maria fiasco, neither Ramos or his agent/brother have publicly said anything about wanting to leave or even considering it. All his agent has done so far is squash a few rumors, but he didn't any fuel to the fire. This is Ramos' last chance for a nice big bumper contract and he knows it. So he's going to push very very hard to get it but at the end they will meet in the middle due to his service for the past decade. Ramos is about to be Real Madrid's full time captain with the imminent arrival of De Gea.. do you really think he would give that up to play at Manchester freaking United?! The only reason Di Maria even went there was because PSG couldn't sign him due to FFP and they were willing to pay him whatever he asked for. The fact that he was even willing to go to PSG shows you were his interests lay, add to that his acceptance to move to a Man United that weren't even in the Champions League.. it was all about the money. Difference here is that Ramos wants to stay no matter what, which is why he isn't publicly saying otherwise. All this talk about him leaving is just to add pressure on the board to give him what he wants. The problem is that Ramos is messing with the wrong people and they have never bowed down to any player who made their desire public. So he needs to be careful in that respect. TL;DR Ramos is staying."
realmadrid,3b2krb,torkiaz,1 point,Fri Jun 26 16:21:22 2015 UTC,"Yep couldn't have said it better myself. DiMaria is very open on where his loyalty is (Argentina NT). To him club football is just a way to make a living so it's not absurd that he will just want to go to the team that gives him the most money. Ramos on the other hand bleeds white and has been very showing of his affection towards the club and just looking at the way he plays when he is in that white uniform shows how much he truly cares about us. Ramos is no DiMaria, or Özil."

realmadrid,3b465w,Berdawg,47,Thu Jun 25 20:41:56 2015 UTC,"I don't understand some of the reactions I'm reading, people being critical of him. He deserves more money, and I think behind Ronaldo he is the most important player we have in terms of image, effectiveness on the pitch, etc.... He's undervalued by Real. If anybody seriously believes he can't make a lot more money elsewhere they are smoking rocks. So it's a simple situation at that point, just like it is at any job: if I'm too good at my job and you need me, pay me more money or peace. I respect him. Additionally, Real treats their players like trash. No loyalty whatsoever. Look at Casillas. Di Maria, Mekelele, Ozil, etc.... list goes on. I'm with Ramos all the way. They shouldn't fuck around either. I feel like Ramos is pretty tight with Ronaldo & Casillas. Ronaldo is already pissed at losing Ozil, then di Maria, then Ancelotti, now Ramos? He might peace out too."
realmadrid,3b465w,Osceana,0,Thu Jun 25 21:05:48 2015 UTC,"Ronaldo is already pissed at losing Ozil, then di Maria   I keep hearing this come up over and over again. All sources of those thoughts were nothing more than rumors and no hard nor plausible evidence came out of those.  I'm more inclined to think that Ronaldo is upset that Carlo got sacked, given that he actively came out in support of him just before he got sacked. The Ozil and Di Maria story came after their respective transfers and the story struck me as newspapers were trying to get clicks."
realmadrid,3b465w,noobslayer007,8,Thu Jun 25 23:41:25 2015 UTC,"I do not understand these type of posts. It is common knowledge that both Özil and Cristiano shared a unique partnership together. MisterChip shows that Özil assists the most goals for Cristiano: https://twitter.com/2010misterchip/status/515879701295149056 note: Di María is third after Benzema.  Cristiano and Özil are friends - they share a friendship since the German joined and the Portuguese supported him in his arrival. Something worth mentioning (since it is relevant to the original topic) is that Özil and Ramos were very close friends before the transfer.  Anyways, you do not need a statement from Cristiano specifically condemning the transfer to believe it is true. The two are cordial off the pitch, friends in the training, and partners on the pitch. The original report from AS mentions how Cristiano said in private that he was upset that Özil leaves because Özil knows his play the best. It makes 100% sense to think that Cristiano did not like that Özil was sold."

realmadrid,3b465w,ace-s,-16,Thu Jun 25 21:22:07 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry but I disagree. There are some unreplaceable players in the club but Ramos is not really one of them. He is a fantastic player, don't get me wrong, but he's demanding a raise of almost 50% with 3 years remaining in his contract. Madrid can absolutely not bow down to players like this everytime they decide they want more money. Also Ramos's approach is completely unprofessional and not the behavior expected of a team captain. Florentino is already offering a raise to 7 million a year which is more than reasonable. If he truly believes he can play at the same level as he is currently playing while being payed almost twice as much, then by all means let him leave. The club will continue with or without Ramos but if they give in to (imo) completely unreasonable demands, they set a precedent for any player to demand more money under threat of leaving."
realmadrid,3b465w,CorvoBondurant,13,Thu Jun 25 21:36:32 2015 UTC,If there is any player that is irreplaceable it's Ramos. Besides Ronaldo and Modric who else is irreplaceable? I agree with your other points though.
realmadrid,3b465w,bozz14,1 point,Thu Jun 25 21:48:52 2015 UTC,"Leadership-wise, I think Ramos is irreplaceable at this club. However, there are still two world class/borderline world class CBs on this roster. That doesn't give him the bargaining power to say he's irreplaceable."
realmadrid,3b465w,MaiGoL7,-9,Fri Jun 26 03:03:01 2015 UTC,Only James and Modric are irreplaceable. You can watch how we performed when these guys werent on the field.
realmadrid,3b465w,CorvoBondurant,8,Thu Jun 25 22:12:33 2015 UTC,If you think we would be anywhere near the level of football that we're at without Ronaldo you're delusional.
realmadrid,3b465w,moklboy,6,Thu Jun 25 22:15:50 2015 UTC,"Ramos is definitely one of the most important players in Madrid and I would also say he is irreplaceable. There is literally no player in the world with his athleticism, technical ability, offensive power and leadership besides him. He has been here 10 years, only Casillas has been here longer, with Marcelo coming after Ramos with 8 years (and we all know Marcelo is not a captain). He is probably the only one in our squad besides Ronaldo who has been top 10 or even top 5 in his position for the last ~7 years. He deserves a raise."
realmadrid,3b465w,ISCOREDwithISCO,-3,Thu Jun 25 22:42:55 2015 UTC,"Additionally, Real treats their players like trash. No loyalty whatsoever. Look at Casillas. Di Maria...   Ehh... Casillas is treated well at Real Madrid. A handful of fans don't respect him, but the club loves him. That's exactly why he's the highest paid goal keeper on the planet (7.5 million euros per year) at his age even though he hasn't been performing very well lately. He's also the captain of the club and he has been starting even over a very proven Keylor Navas.   As for the Di Maria situation, I didn't watch much that season but I heard that (don't quote me on this) he had a spike in performance during a 6 month stretch or so, and afterwards he demanded a salary that would make him the 3rd or 4th highest paid player on the team. I feel that there it would be ridiculous, he would need to prove himself a lot more to justify such a salary, unlike Ramos who does need the higher salary."
realmadrid,3b465w,TimeTimeTickingAway,19,Fri Jun 26 08:05:47 2015 UTC,"I'd be devastated if Ramos leaves. More so than following the departure of Di Maria, Alonso and Ozil.  The man bleeds white (despite not being from the academy) more than most around him.  He is our talisman."
realmadrid,3b465w,kmshadoze,8,Thu Jun 25 21:50:58 2015 UTC,"It would be a terrible situation for our defense if he left, and I believe he deserves the pay raise"

realmadrid,3b465w,Kriskobg,5,Thu Jun 25 21:38:47 2015 UTC,Just give him a euro for every obscenity yelled around the world when he scored the 93 minute header. Should keep him happy
realmadrid,3b465w,fjperez12,5,Fri Jun 26 00:29:52 2015 UTC,"He deserves every penny he wants. There is no player on this squad more irreplaceable than Ramos. No central defenders in the world have his athleticism and all around ability (Thiago Silva is close, but is older by a year I believe). That along with his leadership skills and popping up at the most important moments are reason enough to give him a raise. He bleeds white, is Spanish, and is the only logical captain left on this squad after Casillas (We shouldn't do it on senority and Carvajal would be my choice in a few years). Forwards and midfielders can be replaced more easily on the transfer market, but there are zero ELITE central defenders on the market. Give him his money."
realmadrid,3b465w,littletoft,5,Fri Jun 26 15:27:36 2015 UTC,"The reason I want him to stay (besides being a great defender obviously), is because if we end up losing both him and Casillas the same season (which certainly isn't a done deal I'm being a pessimist here but you know, the transfer window kind of does that to me) I'm not going to to be able to look at the field and see someone and say 'that person right there, they /are/ Real Madrid. That's the human embodiment of my team' anymore.   Ramos and Casillas are the cornerstones of the current RM squad and like them or hate them, they bleed white. They are the best representations our current squad has of what being a Madridista means. It would be one thing to lose one in a season but both? What does my new squad even look like? I don't want to find out.  Contract negotiations are always tricky. It's going to be messy no matter what. I also wouldn't put a whole lot of stock in what Spanish papers are reporting. Perez is known for leaking things to the press to move things in his favor. Plus, 90 percent of the speculation during the transfer season just flat out tabloid fodder.  Do I think this could be handled better? Probably, but I have a hard time seeing how with our current president. You kind of need to bring in the big guns to even get to the table IMO. That being said, bringing the big guns can backfire spectacularly because our president gives like negative shits about maintaining a consistent squad. I think Ramos will probably settle at 8, which I personally think is reasonable given his time at the club and the amount he could get paid elsewhere.   Club loyalty is important but it's also peoples livelihoods, you know? If you're a professional athlete you only have a set amount of time to cash up and get out. I don't begrudge them for wanting to be paid more.  *edited for spelling"

realmadrid,3b1u06,FRE3STYL3R,8,Wed Jul 1 06:09:15 2015 UTC,The tactics by his agent brother are really deplorable but in time people will forget it. I still don't believe he should get 10ME per year. 8 is the maximum I would pay him.
realmadrid,3b1u06,AfricazMost,3,Thu Jun 25 11:33:17 2015 UTC,"As an agent myself I cringe when people do this old trick of going in for the kill asking silly money at a vulnerable time. It has a high backfire rate and is just shitty, I only do models who have little connection to the brand they rep, I've done it a few times, I wont lie, but only for slightly more money and I would NEVER do this kind of silly business with a long standing connection.  It's shitty behavior and to be honest, yes, I do think less of him because of it. It's also bad ""agentry/agenting/whatever"". But then if you have a sycophantic agent who wants to blow smoke up your arse and get a higher percentage, they can manipulate you into these things, especially in a situation like football, where there are such huge wage differences between people on the same team, would be easy to wind someone up.   When will people learn not to have their family on their professional team? ""Oh but he's my brother/dad...he can only want the best for me surely..."" Christ."
realmadrid,3b1u06,brazenrumraisin,6,Thu Jun 25 14:07:43 2015 UTC,"When Bale get's 9 per year, and Benz and Iker gets 7,5 each I can see the frustration of getting 6. He should be the top-earner after Cristiano, but he isn't. Not saying any of them actually need to earn this much in first place, but when you're valued below players of less importance I can see the problem at hand."
realmadrid,3b1u06,ItalianTacticz,4,Thu Jun 25 11:17:47 2015 UTC,"I mostly agree with this. Ramos is arguably the best in his position in the world. If you don't agree with that, at the very least you have to agree he's extremely important for Madrid and he is the man that saved La Decima for us. Madrid treats their players like shit, they just toss them aside and have no loyalty. He's trying to leverage more money because he knows how they work. I don't blame him at all, and neither should anyone else."
realmadrid,3b1u06,Osceana,2,Thu Jun 25 14:28:00 2015 UTC,"Even though I fully support his right to try and get as big a salary as he possibly can, I will still not hold him in as high of a regard, however irrational that may be.

realmadrid,3b1u06,prlol,-2,Thu Jun 25 23:45:05 2015 UTC,"He is not even the best central defender in the team. I still rate Pepe and Varane over him.  Yes, he is better than both of them when attacking but that's not the only thing that matters as a defender. Plus with his status at the club to expect that much money even though his performances doesn't mirror that.Yes, I will have hard feelings over this.  I have absolutely no problems with selling him if a good offer comes. If he wants to leave then he should leave.Plus we can compensate him very good.  Maybe I'm wrong but so many people are panicking because he could leave. Did you not watch him play the last few years?We are not selling Ronaldo or Modric here."

realmadrid,3b5wyi,BrokenestRecord,3,Fri Jun 26 13:59:40 2015 UTC,This post reaks of self righteousness and narcissism. Why would you concern yourself with the words other people use?
realmadrid,3b5wyi,cieldarko,8,Fri Jun 26 20:18:50 2015 UTC,"People in Guatemala and I assume other spanish speaking countries have been refering to it as Real as in, ""Él le va al Real"" for decades. Just because it isn't common there doesn't make it wrong. It becomes the colloquial use.  To call fans plastic because of this is just arrogant."
realmadrid,3b5wyi,dabumtsss,3,Fri Jun 26 08:38:57 2015 UTC,"I hear you and understand where you are coming from, but I think it has a lot to do with where you are from. I live in the states and there is only one team people are talking about when they say 'Real'. We don't even think about our own MLS teams when we only say 'Real'. It's a good thing that the team brand has gotten to this point internationally. It's recognition. Pero gracias por avisarme que me viera estúpido si refiero al equipo así en Madrid! Solo por eso te doy el upvote."

I'll call it what I damn well please to. If we're having an open discussion and we all already know who we're talking about, what's wrong with just Real? Would it kill the flow of the conversation or discussion if you heard it? If it would truly bother a fellow fan and help form a negative opinion of someone who loves the same club then it's probably said fan that's plastic and not the one who could care less. The best thing about this club is that it is known worldwide and that it's greatness can be simplified by one title, ""Real"", by anyone and everyone in the footballing world will know exactly who is being referenced. I am sorry that the majority of our fan base may not follow your local circles ""rules"" by calling the team by it's full name but this a team whose fan base outside Spain may outnumber said local favor"

realmadrid,3b5wyi,acecreator_19,0,Fri Jun 26 10:29:43 2015 UTC,"Well if real means royal, then instead of always saying Royal Madrid some people likes to short it down to 'the Royal' ish. Don't see the issue really, it's not disrespecting or belittling the club or it's history in any way. Saying just Madrid could be confused with Atletico, although that's what I am used to call the club."
realmadrid,3b5wyi,acecreator_19,-5,Fri Jun 26 19:57:09 2015 UTC,Thanks for the tip! I usually refer to the team as Madrid but amongst my friends I tend to use the term real. Only because they're assholes who ask which one of the two. Then I explain how the term real was given by the king. And yadada by then we've diverted from the subject and they become rather annoyed. I love the team and would prefer to call them as true Madrid fans refer to Los Blancos.

realmadrid,3b0f1z,this-username,5,Thu Jun 25 00:33:00 2015 UTC,"really? i'd say he's hardly had enough minutes to make that claim, and tbh i felt the little time he has played he's actually been decent. he's not exactly a replacement for Ramos but i think he has a lot of potential. plus he's actually home grown which i appreciate.   i think if Ramos actually left (which i still really really doubt he would), we could get a decent CB with the intent of rotating with Nacho. given Benitez' love for rotating, this is likely what would happen."
realmadrid,3b0f1z,cieldarko,12,Thu Jun 25 01:01:48 2015 UTC,What potential does he have? he's already 25 and he's average at best. I wouldn't rely on him at all.
realmadrid,3b0f1z,crazyeyes91,5,Thu Jun 25 02:22:43 2015 UTC,He is naturally a fullback and a good one. CB just isn't for him.
realmadrid,3b0f1z,XxDaft7xX,2,Thu Jun 25 04:55:46 2015 UTC,"Wewould have to, because Nacho is not starting eleven level and Pepe isn't getting any younger. I would go for Laporte or Otamendi."
realmadrid,3b0f1z,Buddacry,2,Fri Jun 26 10:46:58 2015 UTC,"Laporte would be sick, partnered with Varane for that French synergy! But I'm really, really, really hoping Ramos stays until he retires..."

realmadrid,3b0f1z,crazyeyes91,1 point,Wed Jun 24 23:56:54 2015 UTC,We absolutely have to. I think our best bet is to partner Varane and Pepe this season and buy a young CB like Laporte and ease him in the lineup. We don't know how long Pepe will be in top form.
realmadrid,3b0f1z,Negrodamus06,2,Thu Jun 25 04:55:22 2015 UTC,then who after pepe?  fuck! Ramos just please don't leave
realmadrid,3b0f1z,abravenoob,1 point,Thu Jun 25 05:14:14 2015 UTC,"I think we should buy someone who is world class like Hummels or Boateng to slot into the first team, and then another (preferably Spanish) for depth such as Inigo Martinez to eventually replace Pepe.   Nacho is homegrown, so he will be staying around. However I do not see him ever being more than a 4th option at CB or a 3rd option at fullback, so we would need someone of better quality."

realmadrid,3az057,RMstreamer,0,Wed Jun 24 17:52:38 2015 UTC,"I don't think Perez is stupid enough to sell Ramos without signing another high profile player or two.   I've said it before and I'll say it again, signing Hazard and Alaba could make up for Ramos leaving."
realmadrid,3az057,bozz14,2,Thu Jun 25 03:28:06 2015 UTC,Why Hazard? Where's he going to play if CR and Bale already take up the LW spots?
realmadrid,3az057,RMstreamer,-5,Thu Jun 25 04:21:37 2015 UTC,Hazard can play anywhere upfront or behind the attack.
realmadrid,3az057,bozz14,2,Thu Jun 25 04:59:48 2015 UTC,"So if Bale or CR are on the left, and Benz or CR are up top, and Bale or James are on the right, and James or Isco or Kroos are in the middle, where does that leave Hazard? Who do you bench for him? Why would this team need another ball-dominant player when it already has several of them?"
realmadrid,3az057,RMstreamer,0,Thu Jun 25 13:34:37 2015 UTC,Hazard can easily bench Isco/James and that's not a bad thing. It'll give us insane depth.

The recent stunt with the Barça elections, the struggles with the medical team, and Sergio's perception of him being undervalued are extremely clear."

It's not something you throw out without giving it some serious thought. If Ramos truly wants to leave, then those feelings must've been developing over time, and the contract/wage demands, isn't as big a part as we thought.   That being said, it's only a rumour (at a convenient time) and there is still time for this situation to be resolved. Still early days in this affair."

realmadrid,3az057,mr_potroast,1 point,Fri Jun 26 03:59:16 2015 UTC,Yes they don't HAVE to sell and if Ramos doesn't want to leave they most likely won't. Having a player on your team that doesn't want to be there is very problematic and so clubs will usually sell in this situation for less than the buyout clause.
realmadrid,3az057,sugarpopsrock,1 point,Fri Jun 26 09:42:26 2015 UTC,nooooooooooooo
realmadrid,3az057,torkiaz,0,Thu Jun 25 05:30:51 2015 UTC,"It's pretty amusing seeing how many people actually think there's an ounce of truth to Ramos leaving.  Ramos is vice captain of both Real Madrid and Spain. Once Casillas is benched or not called up anymore he will be Spain's captain for years to come. Do you guys really think Perez will let Spain's future captain go? Do you guys really think that Perez, the man who did the impossible to sign an 18 year old Ramos for a record breaking deal, will let him go?  Unlike the Di Maria fiasco, neither Ramos or his agent/brother have publicly said anything about wanting to leave or even considering it. All his agent has done so far is squash a few rumors, but he didn't any fuel to the fire.   This is Ramos' last chance for a nice big bumper contract and he knows it. So he's going to push very very hard to get it but at the end they will meet in the middle due to his service for the past decade.   Ramos is about to be Real Madrid's full time captain with the imminent arrival of De Gea.. do you really think he would give that up to play at Manchester freaking United?! The only reason Di Maria even went there was because PSG couldn't sign him due to FFP and they were willing to pay him whatever he asked for. The fact that he was even willing to go to PSG shows you were his interests lay, add to that his acceptance to move to a Man United that weren't even in the Champions League.. it was all about the money.   Difference here is that Ramos wants to stay no matter what, which is why he isn't publicly saying otherwise. All this talk about him leaving is just to add pressure on the board to give him what he wants. The problem is that Ramos is messing with the wrong people and they have never bowed down to any player who made their desire public. So he needs to be careful in that respect.   TL;DR Ramos is staying."

realmadrid,3azbkj,brazenrumraisin,2,Wed Jun 24 19:06:09 2015 UTC,"When you have players serving a club for years and years (and its more prominent thing in this age), it means they have feelings towards the club.

We've been lucky, but what if we had a real nightmare of a person next in line? Honorable, but bad system.   EDIT: Also, like you say, serious longevity is getting scarcer, hypothetically in the right set of circumstances we could end up with someone whos been with the club a season or maybe 2, hardly a long built up loyalty."
realmadrid,3azbkj,brazenrumraisin,1 point,Wed Jun 24 23:40:58 2015 UTC,"God, honestly we should see if Xabi would want to come back and play CB if Sergio leaves."
realmadrid,3azbkj,UnlimitedFoxes,4,Thu Jun 25 19:58:29 2015 UTC,"If it wasn't a seniority based system it would probably be Ronaldo. I dont think he is a leader per say, he is a beast and a presence, but maybe not the guy who will motivate other with a speech, he will motivate by example. I think it would be cool to see Modric as captain."
realmadrid,3azbkj,SmokiestElfo,8,Thu Jun 25 03:45:51 2015 UTC,Arbeloa should be captain considering what he's done for the club. (This may or may not be sarcasm)
realmadrid,3azbkj,lemadridist4,22,Wed Jun 24 20:12:31 2015 UTC,Arabeloa is like if a very fit fan put on a jersey and somehow has managed to make everyone believe he is an actual player on the team.
realmadrid,3azbkj,GiantsRTheBest2,4,Wed Jun 24 21:50:57 2015 UTC,Fucking brilliant description
realmadrid,3azbkj,Pensa23,1 point,Thu Jun 25 05:35:43 2015 UTC,"Hey, come on now. Arbeloa's a solid defender. He doesn't do much on the offensive end tho. Good back up."
realmadrid,3azbkj,ganeshcrm7,2,Thu Jun 25 08:55:48 2015 UTC,"it's the opposite I feel, Arbeloa's crosses are quite decent.. didn't he get quite a few assists last season?"
realmadrid,3azbkj,veryoriginaleh,1 point,Thu Jun 25 14:00:29 2015 UTC,His crosses are above average. He's always been known for reliable defense. And stamina. He used to run back and forth a LOT in his Liverpool days.
realmadrid,3azbkj,ganeshcrm7,5,Thu Jun 25 14:42:04 2015 UTC,"That seniority thing is stupid. If Casillas & Ramos leave, that means the new captain will be Marcelo. And if he gets injured or something, it is Pepe. Cool."
realmadrid,3azbkj,albanian7,1 point,Thu Jun 25 01:20:00 2015 UTC,"I'm okay with seniority when the players are leaders (Raul, Casillas, and Ramos). But Marcelo isn't captain material at all, IIRC Higuain would have been next if he's still with the club. Pepe is not a bad choice.  and next would have been CR and Benzema, not sure with Benz leadership skills."
realmadrid,3azbkj,feb914,1 point,Thu Jun 25 01:44:06 2015 UTC,"Yes, it usually turns out OK and often it is the right choice, because that person knows the club very well and all that. If two players have equal leadership skills, it is fine to be biased and give it to the guy that's been here the longer. But to decide it solely on seniority is plainly stupid. Marcelo? Really?"
realmadrid,3azbkj,albanian7,1 point,Thu Jun 25 15:13:38 2015 UTC,"I disagree with you, Marcelo is a great leader and he is usually the guy that relays information to the others from the coach. I have seen this when I watched them at the Benarbeu. He's very very vocal keeping the players around him organized, something which isn't picked up on TV."
realmadrid,3azbkj,SergioSammut,3,Thu Jun 25 17:52:30 2015 UTC,iirc Marcelo has been captain a few times. Not sure how he is as a captain but yeah
realmadrid,3azbkj,zeNap,2,Wed Jun 24 20:50:00 2015 UTC,"Seniority is based on when they first signed.   Among the current squad, only Casillas and Ramos were there before he was signed."
realmadrid,3azbkj,torkiaz,-3,Thu Jun 25 08:50:08 2015 UTC,My guess for captain would be Ronaldo. Really can't see anyone else with the armband .  Vice captain maybe Pepe?
realmadrid,3azbkj,BeutifulTortuga,10,Wed Jun 24 18:37:56 2015 UTC,seniority
realmadrid,3azbkj,cieldarko,5,Wed Jun 24 18:40:24 2015 UTC,"cr isn't leader per say.  he leads by his performance, but you need someone vocal and can keep the team together, someone commanding in the dressing room"
realmadrid,3azbkj,gqtrees,5,Wed Jun 24 20:09:39 2015 UTC,"Agree, I love the guy but I would not like him to be captain at all."
realmadrid,3azbkj,brazenrumraisin,5,Wed Jun 24 20:17:40 2015 UTC,I'm okay with him being vice captain though. He does motivate other people out there (if he himself isn't throwing another fit).
realmadrid,3azbkj,CrAppyF33ling,1 point,Wed Jun 24 20:23:01 2015 UTC,"Agreed, no issue with vice."
realmadrid,3azbkj,brazenrumraisin,2,Wed Jun 24 20:25:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah I agree. I would prefer him not be captain but if Casillas and Ramos were to leave, there's no one in the team that can lead. I feel like Ronaldo would only get captaincy because he's the star of the team, which is why he is the captain of Portugal. I've said before that we need a player that can lift the team and help us grind out tough results. Ramos is supposed to be that player which is why I really hope he doesn't leave. I love the guy."

realmadrid,3au4ms,ChedduhBob,10,Tue Jun 23 15:18:08 2015 UTC,"Quality post. Multiples examples to back up the argument, links to sources, and discussion. We need more things like this.  I personally feel that the medical staff should comprise of those physicians, trainers, and therapists that the players trust.  I personally have torn a ligament in my ankle, dislocated and tore a ligament in my knee, and dislocated my shoulder over the course of the past 2 years. I always went to the same orthopedic surgeon for every injury and the same physical therapists. Even if i had to wait an extra week because one of them wasn't available or had to wait extra time in the office.  That is because I'm confident in their advice and treatment.  I feel that without confidence in the medical staff a player cannot have confidence in his own body during and after the recovery process. This affects their game drastically."
realmadrid,3au4ms,Thor395,20,Tue Jun 23 15:48:26 2015 UTC,You would think Real Madrid would have the best medical team available. It's ridiculous the players have to go somewhere else to get treatment. Did our contract with Sanitas end?
realmadrid,3au4ms,cieldarko,7,Tue Jun 23 15:51:40 2015 UTC,Sports medicine  has changed dramatically in the last 2-3 years. Nutrition as well is always a refined component that is constantly optimized.   All this shake up that's happened today in Madrid is because of  Barcas fruitful changes to their medical staff last season. Madrid were simply medically out-modernized and that's really unacceptable.
realmadrid,3au4ms,RMstreamer,4,Tue Jun 23 17:20:38 2015 UTC,"Someone mentioned it's Perez's way of skimping out on some extra expenditure, which I'm willing to believe."
realmadrid,3au4ms,TheGogoy,3,Tue Jun 23 21:03:06 2015 UTC,"Quality posts like these is what makes this sub great. I think people, including me, blamed Carlo for the injuries because the coach is always seen as the primary leader in the club, where in fact this could have been out of his control."

realmadrid,3aulh6,dzuncan,4,Tue Jun 23 20:27:47 2015 UTC,I'd put Reus on the right actually.

realmadrid,3aulh6,pooptrooper1,5,Wed Jun 24 02:14:22 2015 UTC,"I'm 95% sure Hazard wouldn't leave Chelsea this summer. Mourinho has expressed something that each of Hazard's legs will cost 100 million or something and Chelsea just won the League and League Cup, so he's happy there.  However, I do agree, I'd prefer to have Hazard over Reus personally if they would cost the same."
realmadrid,3aulh6,nunixnunix04,1 point,Wed Jun 24 03:19:09 2015 UTC,There's no way Reus would cost as much as Hazard. You don't even hear about him as much. He's also 2 years older.

I mean a false 9. I would go for Cavani. He is hardworking, plays for the team and is no looking for the spotlight."
realmadrid,3aulh6,Huge_DisgustingBrain,2,Wed Jun 24 16:53:01 2015 UTC,It is very upsetting to hear Atletico buy Jackson Martinez and Luciano Vietto and we do not have a backup striker. I would have been very content with either of them being our 2nd striker.
realmadrid,3aulh6,Negrodamus06,3,Wed Jun 24 17:08:27 2015 UTC,"The only realistic replacement I'd personally be happy with is Rooney H-Hear me out guise.   Benzemia does so much thankless things on-top of having the vision and link-up play to help get the best out of Ronaldo. Another way he does this is by being a serious goal threat himself, they can't all mark Ronaldo and Bale when he's had decent tallies over the years. What I'm trying to say is that he's incredibly well rounded in a way/level that many great strikers (realistically available for purchase) aren't apart from Rooney.  That's assuming there isn't a change up in our main style of attack, otherwise there's a plethora of hypothetical replacements for the club to eye."

realmadrid,3aulh6,neklos,1 point,Tue Jun 23 19:53:01 2015 UTC,"For one, he is Spanish and from Castilla which is great. He is young and he is already the starting number 9 on the Spanish National team. He's fast, a great finisher, and loves Real Madrid. He has gotten better at distributing the ball and dribbling one on one while with Juve and was actually given a chance to thrive. Something that didn't happen with Mourinho or Ancelotti. Now that we will be rotating players, it would be a perfect time to bring him back."

I don't think any other big name strikers are that realistic of an option."
realmadrid,3aulh6,bozz14,3,Tue Jun 23 17:35:09 2015 UTC,"I've heard a few things about Real thinking of letting him go and United thinking of purchasing him.

realmadrid,3at18x,neklos,2,Tue Jun 23 15:13:25 2015 UTC,Coentrao provides more balance than Marcelo attacking and defending... but I hate how much he complains and gets easily thrown off his game
realmadrid,3at18x,cieldarko,4,Tue Jun 23 15:53:19 2015 UTC,The best leftback from april to may
realmadrid,3at18x,MaiGoL7,6,Tue Jun 23 16:27:02 2015 UTC,I think there's an outside chance he stays being that Benitez likes to rotate and Marcelo is always hurt. Fabio is seriously good!
realmadrid,3at18x,KeiserSoze24,3,Tue Jun 23 13:30:28 2015 UTC,"Yup. It's surprising to see, that whenever Marcelo's injured, Coentrao isn't. It's like they're made for each other."
realmadrid,3at18x,KeiserSoze24,5,Tue Jun 23 14:13:34 2015 UTC,You are so right. It's crazy that coentrao can't get in the lineup even though Marcelo is usually good to miss 1/3-1/2 of the season. He can defend his ass off too.
realmadrid,3at18x,joevaded,5,Tue Jun 23 14:21:52 2015 UTC,"Except for that one time where we had to use Essien as a fullback. We lost Coentrao, Marcelo and Arbeloa."

Not sure if they will have last seasons, but I can't imagine they wouldn't have them since next years just came out. Picked some awesome champions league gear there a year ago.  There may be a better priced store that someone here knows about, but I found this place good and better than the official store. I don't know how to link pinned locations on google maps so here is the address (take the metro to the Puerto del Sol and it's one of the shops in the square):  Futbolmania Madrid  Plaza de la Puerta del Sol, 5  28013 Madrid  Spain  Here's their website too. http://www.futbolmanianet.com/"

It's one a big square, close to Plaza Mayor. And yes, they had the 2014/2015 kit at a reduced price before the season was over yet. I was there in April.  If you can't find that store; basically all tourist/souvenir stores on Gran Vía sell legit shirts for a reduced price. They just have a lesser range of sizes and shirts. Some even print names too."

realmadrid,3aq014,Micke38,14,Mon Jun 22 15:53:21 2015 UTC,"I'm honestly so excited to see how we're going to play.   You have to draw a distinction between style of play and formation. Many people believe that the players' position on the pitch, 4-4-2, 4-3-3, is a style of play and that's not the case. Our style of play will be based on playing attacking football, having possession of the ball whenever we can, attacking by moving the ball quickly, looking not to lose balance between attack and defence, showing a positive sort of aggression and adapting to a range of formations if necessary. We'll try to impose our brand of football, but we have to be able to deal with other alternatives if required. That's the difference between style of play, basically an attacking one in our case, and formation, which will be the players' position on the pitch."
realmadrid,3aq014,cieldarko,3,Mon Jun 22 16:10:15 2015 UTC,"exactly I wanted to highlight this exact paragraph and post it here, when speculation started that Rafa will be our new coach everyone was worried that he is defensive minded but after reading this paragraph it is making me exited to see what kind of attacking football we are going to see from Real   one of our biggest hurdles last year was our games against the top 4 in La Liga were we lost many points from these games"
realmadrid,3aq014,ace-s,2,Mon Jun 22 20:06:43 2015 UTC,"The entire idea that Benitez is some defense-obsessed, 1:0 grinder ,is just something bunch of clueless people made up."

realmadrid,3ap7rc,ace-s,16,Mon Jun 22 11:38:48 2015 UTC,"The question is not being paid more. He'll obviously be paid more. He wants 10m, however, which is quite frankly bullshit."
realmadrid,3ap7rc,normannb,-4,Mon Jun 22 13:07:55 2015 UTC,I think it depends on how many years it is. If it was like 10m for 5 or 6 years then I could see it happening.
realmadrid,3ap7rc,abouchedid,11,Tue Jun 23 00:41:31 2015 UTC,Sergio Ramos a defender is expecting to be paid the wage of star forward or midfielder. It's not realistic.
realmadrid,3ap7rc,AfricazMost,3,Mon Jun 22 13:15:34 2015 UTC,He saved Madrid's ass in the UCL and powered Bayern through with 3? goals against them in recent memory. Combined with his defending and leadership his goal influence probably warrants 10m.
realmadrid,3ap7rc,maplemario,1 point,Mon Jun 22 21:01:08 2015 UTC,"Ramos is in the top three defenders in the world, he deserves to get paid as a midfielder and a forward."

realmadrid,3ap7rc,vicinadp,10,Mon Jun 22 14:22:41 2015 UTC,I wouldn't take that one too seriously. A bunch of the papers were tripping over themselves to write about his massive salary (relative to a 16 y.o.) when that salary was both proven to be inflated and also extremely highly incentive-based. I really doubt it's straight up 2m each season.

realmadrid,3ap7rc,ISCOREDwithISCO,1 point,Tue Jun 23 00:54:10 2015 UTC,"While I understand what you're trying to say, the club is on a wage structure that would never give Varane this wage just yet. I'm almost positive its between 2-3me. It was in the press when he extended this past September."
realmadrid,3ap7rc,crazyeyes91,1 point,Tue Jun 23 08:06:40 2015 UTC,I agree with this. I think that he is a super prospect and I want him to start next season but I think his wage right now is kinda crazy. I guess thats what you have to pay to retain that kind of talent.

realmadrid,3alhhk,RMstreamer,14,Sun Jun 21 14:08:46 2015 UTC,"the numbers are wrong.  It says ""since 2009"" which is a bad starting time imo because the seasons are usually 08/09 or 09/10. That is why I only looked at the stats from 09/10 and 1 june 2009 for their national team stats. I also took the 2 yellows in one game as a red card.  The result:  Neymar: 66 yellows and 4 reds  Pepe: 68 yellows and 4 reds  I highly doubt that in half a year the players got 32 yellow cards  and 3 red cards together."
realmadrid,3alhhk,c4mmi,2,Sun Jun 21 21:25:15 2015 UTC,"2009 is probably used because that is when Neymar started playing for Santos. In Brazil the seasons also only go over one year, so the seasons don't fit with La Liga either way.  This gives approximately the numbers shown for Neymar. This gives Pepes numbers, and the red cards are at least correct (I didn't check the yellows)."
realmadrid,3alhhk,erlendig,2,Mon Jun 22 21:22:00 2015 UTC,That is a possibility but I still doubt the 100 yellows for Neymar. The whole meme just rides the current hate train of Neymar.   The numbers seem to be correct for Pepe.

realmadrid,3alhhk,yxxnoobxxy,5,Mon Jun 22 13:57:37 2015 UTC,Shouldn't the same logic be applied to Neymar though. He still fairly young. I'd like to see Pepe's cards during Neymars age. Not a fixed point in time where one has clearly dealt with his shit and the other is just stepping into his own. Just my two cents though.
realmadrid,3alhhk,BagelsAndJewce,1 point,Mon Jun 22 07:38:32 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I see your point. I guess you're right. The whole murderer thing though... Like really, a murderer?"
realmadrid,3alhhk,10waf,2,Mon Jun 22 08:20:33 2015 UTC,I don't think anyone deserves to be a murderer and if you look at this comment I made farther down both essentially get carded at the same rate. That's far from being a murderer. People just dislike Madrid. This just caught my eye cause I like Neymar and I like Madrid really tore me up when Neymar went to 'them'.
realmadrid,3alhhk,BagelsAndJewce,24,Mon Jun 22 08:26:17 2015 UTC,"Look I love Madrid, but if Pepe got kicked as much as Neymar on the pitch he would get twice the cards as him."

realmadrid,3alhhk,korencek,5,Sun Jun 21 12:07:37 2015 UTC,Since 09'   Pepe: 228 games for Madrid  Neymar: 317 for Santos and Barcelona  This isn't counting for any international.  That's   (0.32 )yellows for Neymar per game (0.02) reds per game  (0.34)yellows for Pepe per game (0.02) reds per game.  Sorry to shit on the circle jerk but they're so identical per game that I won't even bother with the 0.02 in yellows. And I didn't count any international games during that stretch. So who knows if the dude who made the image nit picked every card to get biased information out.  EDIT: Since 2010 Neymars had 65 National team appearances. Couldn't find Pepe's from 09 but from 07 he's had 65.   Conclusion: They get carded at the same rate. Pepe slightly more but only at 0.02 per game.
realmadrid,3alhhk,BagelsAndJewce,1 point,Mon Jun 22 07:46:26 2015 UTC,"Nice, thanks for this. Still good on Pepe. Or probably bad on Neymar, strikers shouldn't get carded at the same rate as defenders IMO..."

realmadrid,3amtt8,DeletoiD,6,Sun Jun 21 20:37:39 2015 UTC,Ramos at his peak is better but Pepe is a little bit more consistent. I think Ramos is still our top CB because Pepe can be beaten with speed since he's getting up there in age.   100% agree with Ramos/Varane as our best CB pairing. Ramos/Pepe pairing honestly should end this season and I hope Ramos/Varane will take over next year. Ramos/Pepe has been disastrous in a couple of matches every single season.
realmadrid,3amtt8,KatsuraYuuki,10,Mon Jun 22 00:02:47 2015 UTC,Am I the only one who prefers him over Varane at times?
realmadrid,3amtt8,NDLC_,2,Sun Jun 21 23:44:27 2015 UTC,I think almost every other commenter in here states that they prefer Ramos Varane.
realmadrid,3amtt8,shervinasayesh,1 point,Mon Jun 22 02:24:53 2015 UTC,"No you're not, I absolutely love Varane, but then I remember his fragile performance against Juventus, both this season and the last ( he concedes crucial headers ) or even against Germany in the quarter final of the 2014 WC ( again lets Hummels win the header and score ) and I think he is just nott ready yet. Soon though, he will be, and for a good decade of being among the best CB."
realmadrid,3amtt8,XxDaft7xX,2,Wed Jun 24 16:57:54 2015 UTC,even against Germany in the quarter final of the 2014 WC ( again lets Hummels win the header and score )    Why use an isolated instance like that? He was solid for the entire tournament while being voted as one of France's best performers by French media.
realmadrid,3amtt8,momin_q,1 point,Thu Jun 25 01:28:43 2015 UTC,"Being French as well as a Real Madrid fan, I have litteraly watched every single one of his games in the last two-three years. Then again, I do recognise I have extremely high expectations, but don't we all ? We're Madridistas after all"
realmadrid,3amtt8,XxDaft7xX,5,Fri Jun 26 00:07:31 2015 UTC,"Good squad player now, but our starting CB partnership has to be Ramos-Varane moving forward if we want to improve."
realmadrid,3amtt8,opouser,2,Sun Jun 21 20:44:37 2015 UTC,"Everyone seems to be in love with Varane-Ramos going forward, but in my eyes Varane does not do enough to track back.  Pepe-Ramos is still our best bet in defense.  He is solid, willing, able, and, most of all, experienced.  I love Varane and he should be getting plenty of minutes as Pepe is getting older, but as of right now he should be the starter in big games.  Apart from all that, I think the Carvajal-Ramos-Pepe-Marcelo back line is remarkably in touch with itself and when they are all healthy and in form we honestly have the best defensive side I have seen.  Just think of how impenetrable they were in the 22 game streak."
realmadrid,3amtt8,Commandophile,3,Mon Jun 22 19:12:00 2015 UTC,"Pepe had another pretty good season. He and Ramos proved to be a good defensive combination once more, and we're a large part of our long winning streak.  He did make some mistakes though that seemed like he just wasn't paying attention or something, but to be fair this was the story of most of our defenders throughout the year. I would also avoid playing him along side Varane against good teams. They seemed to play very bad with each other. This might be due to the clashing style since both are a bit more reserved in defense.  As far as the future, I think he is getting old and we should start to see Varane phased in as the main stay in our defense. Pepe would definitely still be an asset for a few more seasons though, so I think we should do our best to hold on to him unless someone offers crazy money."
realmadrid,3amtt8,ChedduhBob,1 point,Sun Jun 21 19:49:57 2015 UTC,I feel like we need to sign a young discipline center back like varane soon.
realmadrid,3amtt8,goabdulaziz,1 point,Sun Jun 21 22:38:38 2015 UTC,I dont see a point in that cause we have arguably the worlds best cb and we also have varane... Unless you are talking about injury times. Although ramos is 29 he still has time

realmadrid,3almb6,Negrodamus06,12,Sun Jun 21 13:48:18 2015 UTC,I'd take it and let him go.
realmadrid,3almb6,opouser,11,Sun Jun 21 12:53:47 2015 UTC,"I would be opposed to it. His poor games, and the number of poor games he's had, have been grossly exaggerated and this would lead to yet another hole which would then have to be filled with someone who might not be as content with being a bench player like Illarra is."
realmadrid,3almb6,bozz14,12,Sun Jun 21 13:25:48 2015 UTC,"We don't have a hole by him leaving, Illaramendi is already replaced with Casemiro."
realmadrid,3almb6,rishinator,2,Sun Jun 21 13:56:05 2015 UTC,"They're two different types of players. Casemiro has nowhere near the passing and positioning skills of Illarra, especially the former trait where Illarra blows him out of the water."
realmadrid,3almb6,bozz14,2,Sun Jun 21 14:04:02 2015 UTC,Casemiro has nowhere near the passing and positioning skills of Illarra   You simply can't say this if you've ever watched Casemiro last season.
realmadrid,3almb6,RMstreamer,4,Sun Jun 21 14:17:52 2015 UTC,"I made an effort to watch him as there was always the possibility for him to return. I don't at all see how he's Illarra's equal when it comes to passing. He does certain things quite well, but when it comes to controlling the game through possession I don't think he's on the same level."
realmadrid,3almb6,bozz14,2,Sun Jun 21 14:28:59 2015 UTC,What kind of passing are you talking about? Becauses not all passes are equal. Illara rarely ever goes for difficult passes and his pass striking strength is abysmal. He lacks long ball passing abilities entirely and is reliant on having a better passer playing next to him to spread the ball effectively.   Casemiro isn't phenomenal but he has more to offer than the elementary skills of Illara. He has shown that he can get better with time and he is confident in his passing distribution even though he has a less completion rate. He keeps his head up and tackles like his life is on the line. I'd take Casemiro over Illara any day. He deserves a chance to prove himself.
realmadrid,3almb6,RMstreamer,1 point,Sun Jun 21 14:39:29 2015 UTC,"Luckily in Rafa's system, he will have a better passer next to him. Illarra was played out of position by Ancelotti. I want him to stay and show what he can do when he is in a system that suits him."
realmadrid,3almb6,fjperez12,1 point,Tue Jun 23 13:59:35 2015 UTC,So true. All I see is illara passing to defenders. He rarely looks upfield.
realmadrid,3almb6,KeiserSoze24,2,Sat Jun 27 20:07:11 2015 UTC,"But where has he played well? I keep seeing the argument for Illaramendi being ""He hasn't been that bad"" but then why should we keep him? We want players that are good, that add something to the squad. Him not being that bad is not a reason for him to stay lol   just my opinion though"
realmadrid,3almb6,Foxtrot68W,1 point,Mon Jun 22 02:26:54 2015 UTC,I would like it if he was given one more season to prove his worth. I think Benitez could bring the best out of him.

realmadrid,3amcuz,LessThan301,5,Sun Jun 21 20:45:01 2015 UTC,"Highly doubt it.  If anything, It's probably Ramos's agent trying to put pressure on the board to get Ramos a better offer.

realmadrid,3ak62m,BenjenGrimes,11,Sun Jun 21 00:15:11 2015 UTC,"He was being slowly transitioned into playing again under carlo. He had suffered the same injury when he played so he knew it was too soon for him to play as much as he would have wanted. He still showed flashes of brilliance in his limited minutes. As for if he'll make it onto the starting 11, only time will tell."
realmadrid,3ak62m,CorvoBondurant,13,Sun Jun 21 00:18:57 2015 UTC,lets be honest.. he was poor at the chances he was given! mind you he did score a few goals but still performance wise he was nowhere to be seen
realmadrid,3ak62m,donkolo,6,Sun Jun 21 01:20:34 2015 UTC,"""He was poor at the chances he was given"" sounds a lot like the arguments Carlo defenders used with Morata. Fast forward a year and Morata got Carlo fired. Carlo never gave any of the squad players a fair shot at developing as players.   Let's not mince words, Carlo's squad management sucked and it would have cost us all our talented youngsters eventually."
realmadrid,3ak62m,Electric_Pegasus,3,Sun Jun 21 06:00:33 2015 UTC,"I don't know if I agree. I think Carlo did a great job at making the starters happy, but did a terrible job managing the reserves. Note than when he left, none of the reserve guys came out and wished him well or thanked them. I know. I know.  That does not mean they dislike him or any other shit, but it certainly makes you curious why that happened.   In short, I would say that it was hard for him to shine when it is clear your manager has zero faith in you. Makes one unmotivated."
realmadrid,3ak62m,Canario1314,3,Sun Jun 21 04:18:54 2015 UTC,That's why I said flashes of brilliance. He would loose the ball a lot and is no where near where he used to be but every now and then he would do something to make me believe that the talent is still there.
realmadrid,3ak62m,CorvoBondurant,3,Sun Jun 21 01:34:54 2015 UTC,"In the 2013/2014 season he looked to be one of the next great stars in Europe. He was quick, tricky on the ball and could put away chances. Then the injury happened. This season he was not the same player. This could have been down to lack of playing time to get back into form, or maybe just never fully recovering"

It just bugs me because he is so young and acts like he's Ronaldo when in reality hes talented but he hasnt earned all that yet.

No that it's not going to happen, not now, not in a million years, city won't sell their superstar, why would they? Also flo is really fond of Benzema, and our transfer strategy is ultimately decided by him. But honestly, if he wasn't made of glass I'd sign him in a heartbeat."

realmadrid,3aj84j,nocrestmadridista,6,Sun Jun 21 01:38:47 2015 UTC,Benzema is irreplaceable in that he is a great passer and he makes (usually) makes the right play. Few strikers will pass off the ball in the positions he gets in. I think suarez is the only player who can play the same style and we will never be able to buy him. As others have said flo loves him hes not leaving.
realmadrid,3aj84j,Electric_Pegasus,-1,Sun Jun 21 02:18:39 2015 UTC,Aguero is a much better centre forward than Benzema so I hope this happens. Sorry Benzema fans but if we can sell Di Maria and move on with no issues then that is the case for Benzema too.

realmadrid,3aikp6,shhas13,16,Sat Jun 20 15:12:12 2015 UTC,"Nainggolan, when I have seen him, is far up the pitch. Seems more of a box to box type player.  Krychowiak- He's big, he's strong, he cares about defending I like that. He's also got a lot of years left, he's like 26(?). Has had consistent reliable performances for a few years. He's played CB a handful of times so yay versatility. There are some things I don't like however. Drifted around France for like 4 years before being picked up by Sevilla. He's become one of Sevilla's core players and Sevilla are on an upward trend. This is a fan favorite. They'll want a lot of money, may not be best value. He's never played at a big club, felt big expectations/pressure. This is something that personally I feel is a detriment. Not saying it's a deal breaker.  Maxime Gonalons- My personal favorite option. He's big, he's strong, he cares about defending I like that. He's also got a lot of years left, he's like 26(? ... deja vu?). Consistently one of the best if not THE best pure CDM in France. Thiago Motta giving strong competition. He's the captain of his club, Olympique Lyon. OL is a club with lots of history and expectations. He knows what it's like to be under pressure. He's French, and from the same team and about the same age as Benzema. I'd wager they played together at some point over the years (yay friends); throw Varane into there and hey look a french spine Benzema-Gonalons-Varane (easy jokes here). Also he's not a bad long passer. Here are some things I don't like. As he is OL's captain, they won't want to let him go, and he may not want to leave frankly. That's probably why you don't see him mentioned much in transfer rumors. Good side to this I suppose is he isn't hyped to all hell so his price would stay reasonable, for a club captain/potential future legend of the club; no rumor mill inflation.  Gary Medel- In a lab deep in the mountains of Chile, Mascherano's DNA was used to create a clone: Medel. Now, as with most cloned versions, he's not quite as great as the original but still serviceable. I really can't say I've watched him much, and he's not on the level of the other two, but god damn where else am I going to get a better opportunity to make that joke."
realmadrid,3aikp6,BroCirus,1 point,Sat Jun 20 15:50:47 2015 UTC,"Great insight. What do you think about  a player like Schneiderlin coming to Madrid, even though it seems he might remain in the epl?"
realmadrid,3aikp6,BroCirus,3,Sat Jun 20 20:43:20 2015 UTC,I can't say I watched him much at all to be honest. All the stats and plaudits he receives indicate he could be the real deal but I'm always hesitant about any EPL central midfielder; just personal bias.
realmadrid,3aikp6,Foxtrot68W,1 point,Sat Jun 20 23:58:19 2015 UTC,"IMO Krychowiak would be slightly better for us than Gonalons because he has a knowledge of the league and the teams in it, and this may sound stupid but I feel like he's a very intense player, mentally and this quality especially in defensive players is crucial. They require a certain stubbornness and fire within them, they have to really really care when they make a mistake and fix it and be fired up, not to get down on themselves and continue playing shit ala Gareth Bale.   I haven't seen much of Gonalons though but I'd say that Sevilla and OL are similar in stature so the big club pressure would apply to both of them equally. Great read though buddy very well thought out."
realmadrid,3aikp6,neklos,1 point,Mon Jun 22 02:52:01 2015 UTC,"Nainggolan!! I've seen him play at Roma (I like watching Serie A) and Radja is a Very good player/fighter that you want in your team.

Never thought of Nainggolan for the team before, although he would be a good asset for Real Madrid. I don't think Roma are selling him. Rudy Garcia likes him."

realmadrid,3aikp6,bozz14,1 point,Sat Jun 20 17:44:41 2015 UTC,"The new CDM would most likely partner with Modric and Kroos would be pushed up to CAM. James would play on the right wing and Bale on the left, while Ronaldo would move to a more CF role. The players most likely to sit out would be Isco and Benzema, but we have to realize that Benitez's new system would rotate heavily with everyone being used. This is all based on rumors though in the transfer widow currently."
realmadrid,3aikp6,perrydap,3,Sat Jun 20 20:40:30 2015 UTC,I guess I just hate the idea of sitting Benzema for anyone. This team was on its way to titles without a traditional DM so I don't understand why Benz should have to make way for one. A world class striker shouldn't just be a bench player after all he's done for this club.

Keep an eye out for Real Madrid.""    The 27-year-old's agent, Ludovico Spinosi, told IlSussidiario.net, in quotes reported by AS, that remaining at Roma was the most likely thing to happen, but if Madrid came calling that could all change. ""I believe Nainggolan will stay at Roma, although when you are talking about Real Madrid, things can change,"" Spinosi said.     They're just saying he would accept a move to Real Madrid.

realmadrid,3afwoa,cieldarko,-2,Fri Jun 19 22:24:00 2015 UTC,"I'd say he could be top class midfielder, but not right now and I'm not sure if he could be recognized as such playing for Roma."
realmadrid,3afwoa,CrAppyF33ling,0,Sat Jun 20 00:47:11 2015 UTC,Roma is not a mediocre club; Nor should it be consider a bad club!! They have a handful of good players and Roma has been fighting for the Scudetto against a strong and better Juventus team.
realmadrid,3afwoa,neklos,1 point,Wed Jun 24 05:05:09 2015 UTC,"But that's not what I was saying. Nainggolan had a relatively great season and stood out. Just yesterday they voted him player of the season. However, there has barely been buzz about him. Lately Roma as a club haven't been paid much attention to internationally, being a bit overshadowed by Juventus' dominance and the Milan clubs' buzz. and that's why I was saying if he could or couldn't be recognize as a good CM there. I would say he's good enough to be in the top clubs of England, France, and the top clubs here (excluding us and Barcelona because he will be benched most likely). If he did sign for a club that is widely received I would say that there's probably more recognition for him and his good works."
realmadrid,3afwoa,CrAppyF33ling,1 point,Wed Jun 24 05:31:12 2015 UTC,"I'm glad we agree on Roma. The difference between the Milan clubs' buzz and Roma is how Roma finish the season. Milan might have good players, but the player's morale is down the drain. I'm not saying ""we must get him now!!"" Or ""our team needs him"". I'm just saying he's a good player and he can prove it on the pitch. He's a vulture at reading passes to intercept and he's great at driving the ball to attack. If Isco leaves (God forbid) then I would welcome Radja!  For me it's all about options!! I don't want a repeat of last year with too many injuries. Although Rafa rotates..  so I've heard.

realmadrid,3afg34,cieldarko,9,Fri Jun 19 18:24:02 2015 UTC,"I would prefer Kondogbia so we would have a disciplined and strong player in the middle. He'd be a great match to pair with Kroos or modric assuming we go with 2 defensive midfielders. Veratti is a hell of a talent but I prefer defensive players to be more ""under the radar"" no fame or pressure so they focus on their jobs. I feel that getting a ""flashy"" defender usually results in them wanting to play a little higher or thinking they'll get away with more challenges. That's what I love about Varane.  He is very disciplined but a great physical specimen. Reminds me of Thiago silva. Rarely gets yellows because he knows his role and stay in place"

realmadrid,3afg34,Negrodamus06,4,Sun Jun 21 14:11:32 2015 UTC,"The thing is, how much can this new defensive midfielder reasonably expect to play?  A lot is made of Rafa's rotations but I honestly don't think any of Kroos/James/Modric will be sitting as much as the media and fans are making it out. Maybe subbed out a bit earlier or getting a game off here or there, but whichever signing comes in will likely be playing quite elss than they have this past season. That leaves Isco, Illarra, Casemiro and this new signing just waiting for playing time. If a star midfielder comes in then it creates even more of a selection and minutes headache and we've already seen Isco get a bit turned off by the minutes/selection process. If a big-name midfielder comes in then who do you sit, it won't be James or Kroos so Modric, arguably the best all-around midfielder in the world?  If you bring in a young midfielder with room to grow then how can we expect this club to have the patience to let them develop when Illarra was cast aside and reportedly shopped around? What was the point of bringing Casemiro back if the club is already looking for another midfielder who'd stifle his minutes? I think some of the rumored names are great but logistically it just seems like too big of a hassle."
realmadrid,3afg34,bozz14,4,Fri Jun 19 19:30:08 2015 UTC,"Kondogbia isn't a world class DM yet and Verratti isn't a DM, period. If the club spends 60m on Verratti he's sure as hell not going to be just a rotation option, players with that name recognition and price are pretty much guaranteed starters. James is a guaranteed starter and Kroos might be as well given that he was a pretty notable signing last summer. So Modric sits then for the 2015 big acquisition? There are politics involved in these signings, it's not as simple as saying rotate the players and they'll  all be happy.  What happened with Modric was a freak injury. Maybe it happens again, maybe it doesn't, but it doesn't mean that this club needs to spend an absurd amount on a player who'll throw a wrench into the minutes/starts issue already present at the club. Casemiro and Illarra might not be world class, but they should be solid bench players and seem like guys who would be happy with that role."

realmadrid,3afg34,bozz14,2,Fri Jun 19 19:47:44 2015 UTC,Lets see how it turns out
realmadrid,3afg34,cieldarko,3,Fri Jun 19 20:24:38 2015 UTC,"What do you folk think about William Carvalho? Personally, I still have hope in Ilarramendi, he looked good the one time he took over for Kroos but just didn't fit well taking over Modric's responsibilities in the 4-3-3. He could be an excellent component of the pivot in the 4231"
realmadrid,3afg34,Bustamente20,2,Fri Jun 19 20:57:38 2015 UTC,"First of all, our midfield is packed. If we need to bring in a new player, we need to clear out some players. Imo we have enough of firepower offensively in Kroos, modric, James and isco. So, no need to bring any CAM or CM and neither should anyone of them be sold.   Talk about a proper dm we have illara and somewhat Silva (more like a cm for me). Caseimiro had a mixed season with Porto so I don't think he can be relied upon totally. Illara is a player fit for pivot system that Benitez prefers and that's why he understandably failed to thrive in carlo's system.   So, illara should stay atleast one more season at RM as he might fit into the system well . Along with that if  Perez decides we have plenty of already established options in Veratti, matuidi and Kondogbia(my personal choice for the job)."
realmadrid,3afg34,Gotta_do_it,3,Fri Jun 19 21:07:40 2015 UTC,"With Modric, Isco, Kroos, Illara, Lucas Silva and Casemiro I'd say no. Even if we sell one of them we would still be good if we take in to consideration we play a 4-2-3-1. Casemiro is our defensive midfielder for the coming season and we'll have to settle for that. Who know how he will evolve. There's no reason to get in more fresh blood (nor any temptation to come here for the player). Modric and Kroos will be our starters, and we have 3-4 subs for them already. Even if we sell one we still have a problem. We'll need a striker, and thats it. Give Kaylor the #1 spot this season and watch him form in to a top 5 keeper. We're good with Danilo and possibly Lacazette. This is my opinion though.."
realmadrid,3afg34,ItalianTacticz,3,Sat Jun 20 05:34:03 2015 UTC,Everyone is saying Lucas Silva is going to be loaned out.  Am I really the only one who thinks that Silva made a better impression in the time that he played for us than  Casemiro at Porto?
realmadrid,3afg34,sydneywmc,1 point,Sat Jun 20 09:01:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah I like them both actually, and it's nice that they're both Brazilians for their sake. The fact that Benitez rotates players (A LOT) is a really good thing for us now. We get to keep Isco, Jese etc because they'll know that he (Rafa) needs everyone to be at a 100% physical level every match, hence the rotations. Which means Isco, and even Modric & Kroos may all be utilised as CAM's between our wingers at some point this season. But we seriously need a speedy striker that can get in behind the opposing defenders. Benzema is really static.."
realmadrid,3afg34,ItalianTacticz,1 point,Sat Jun 20 00:06:12 2015 UTC,I agree with you that we need another striker. Chicharito was ideal for this but I get that we can't keep him because of the foreign rule. I think the only thing we lack is a backup striker

His entire approach is centered about finding balance in a team, something that got exposed in every big game last year.   Personally I expect Ronaldo to be transitioned to a forward and rotated with Benzema, and both Modric and Isco transitioned to the wings and rotated with James and Bale. So that leaves plenty of openings in the CM."

realmadrid,3afa66,zeNap,2,Fri Jun 19 18:19:52 2015 UTC,"A big price tag can also influence the player's performance. Real Madrid fans push everyone to prove themselves for every cent they're worth and if possible more. For some young players, it can be a way to protect them from the scrutiny."

It starts of as a story that is going to break and push barriers and then just conforms to the normal tropes of young adult literature.  Deogratias was incredible. It was the third graphic novel I read (Watchmen and the Dunk and Egg ones) and it absolutely blew me away."

Currently reading Good Omens and 11 Rings (Phil Jackson bio).  I started off with the desire to emphasise in ESL and eventually moved towards journalism.    Have you seen Midnight in Paris?"

realmadrid,3ae4f0,CrAppyF33ling,1 point,Fri Jun 19 18:20:34 2015 UTC,"I love Hemingway. So I minored in it. But as for my actual transition towards it... Honestly? Travelling. Working in developing countries and seeing how poor their conditions were was... disheartening. One country I worked in for a few years had a law that required undergrads to pass an English exam to get their degree. To balance out and provide the indigenous communities a chance at progress as well, another law was passed that required every school in the country to have an English program along with a provision of funds to accommodate expenses.  Of course, every school took advantage of that. And of course a loophole was found. The law forced the school to have a class and room dedicated towards said curriculum but it forgot to enforce the presence of a qualified teacher as well.   So, the schools took the money to ""build a classroom"" (no builds occurred, outside areas were used), ""hire a qualified teacher"" (not enforced, so something akin to TAs were used at best but usually no teachers were  present), ""acquire materials"" (no materials purchased, copies were made of one book and poor ones at that, the kids laminated them then the laminated copies were sold at a higher price for profit)...  I just... was disheartened. Anywho, long story short... Went to live in Spain with some family for a while, relative is a financial consultant and a client gave him press passes to events and I said this is what I want to do.  Came back stateside, and started doing it. I've worked in general areas of journalism, transitioned towards sports and now freelance for a betting a company. I still can get passes since I technically am still linked to two institutions but I don't do much of that anymore unless Madrid comes or something similar is going on."

The only other strikers I could picture having would be maybe Cavani, Jackson Martinez or bringing back Morata or Callejon."
realmadrid,3ae4f0,ISCOREDwithISCO,3,Fri Jun 19 12:13:52 2015 UTC,I'd rather take Lacazette due to the fact that he's younger and has much more to prove
realmadrid,3ae4f0,Jorgemeister,2,Fri Jun 19 12:48:08 2015 UTC,"Aguero is too good and big of a name to be a rotation option, plus there's no need to spend ridiculous numbers for a rotation option when you already have a world class striker. Lacazette is strongly rumored to be PSG's already. Cavani is, IMO, overrated and also not someone who'll likely be thrilled over being a rotation option. Martinez seems to be off to Milan, Morata needs starting minutes and seemingly has no interest in coming back. Callejon isn't a striker.  Personally, I'm not convinced a backup has to be bought. I think CR can fill in up top when Benz needs a break or is injured with Bale sliding over to the left and someone like James or Isco taking over on the right."
realmadrid,3ae4f0,joevaded,1 point,Fri Jun 19 13:14:22 2015 UTC,"Callejon have played striker on numerous occasions previously in his career, and did so also under Mourinho at times. I think someone who plays their heart out for Real Madrid (Callejon) would be a great super sub/injury fill inn for Benzema, as he is really quick, lethal in front of goal and has the habit of getting in behind the lines. He is also already used to Benitez and vice versa as well."
realmadrid,3ae4f0,Jorgemeister,2,Fri Jun 19 23:00:39 2015 UTC,Love Aguero but he gets injured way too easily and is already on his prime/decline so getting half a good season wouldn't be in our best interest to someone so expensive

realmadrid,3acu9x,golferdudeag,17,Fri Jun 19 02:35:14 2015 UTC,Absolutely fine with it. No need for him to be out there with a multi-goal lead versus average sides. There's more than enough offense on this team to cover for him if things get tense when he sits.
realmadrid,3acu9x,bozz14,2,Fri Jun 19 03:41:27 2015 UTC,Exactly.  Why risk an injury? Plus it gives his teammates a chance to shine as well. Win win
realmadrid,3acu9x,rambopr,29,Fri Jun 19 19:15:56 2015 UTC,I think it's the right choice. Age catches up with everyone and you can tell he has started to slow down. Rotations are good for everyone.

realmadrid,3acu9x,daxl70,2,Fri Jun 19 15:54:21 2015 UTC,"There's no way Rafa would leave Ronaldo out for a whole match.

At the same time he has a strong intrest in maintaining his extremely high standards and statistics. I think ronaldo being much more central next season will help maintain his high statistics whilst also allowing rafa to tailor his minuites a little without hurting the team too much."

realmadrid,3a9vw3,dfbejarano4,23,Fri Jun 19 04:06:55 2015 UTC,"That is exactly the point, it shows the clear difference between their characters.  Neymar was getting easily frustrated, lashing out even before the red card. It takes real character and maturity to show kindness towards people of hostile nature. We should be proud to have James wearing the white shirt  and there is clear proof from last night that James will leave his mark at Real Madrid."
realmadrid,3a9vw3,lacienega,8,Thu Jun 18 19:25:38 2015 UTC,"It's obvious James thinks he's incredibly talented and doesn't begrudge him anything over it, and even seems to think he's wasting his talents by being such a bitch all the time. Even when he deliberately attacked two of his team mates and the rest of his team were still fighting over it behind him, James was more concerned with trying to get Neymar to not lose his head anymore, than he was with being part of the fight. I think it's funny/telling too that I think a security guy or someone starts circling James because he thinks James is looking to fight with Neymar over it, but James is just giving him a hug and telling him how talented he is."

Neymar was fucking immature, but it's pretty understandable where he's coming from. I kind of want Brazil to lose now (to see if we get rid of Dunga- I think our team has only regressed with him in charge- both games our team was completely disorganized and no sense of a game plan), so I want to cheer for another team to win. I really like James, but I fucking hate Cuadrado's fucking guts (bacca can fuck off too), so I'm unsure if I want to cheer for Colombia.... Chile I guess could work, but for some reason I can't like Alexis or Vidal... Argentina no chance in hell. Maybe Uruguay? I guess I'll be cheering for either Uruguay or Colombia (because of my boy James- and also Martinez and Falcao are cool- though I kind of secretly hope somewhere along the way Cuadrado stops playing: I guess benched rather than injured because it's never nice to see a player injured)"

Guy is super talented, but his attitude and diving make him insufferable. I do not understand how Barca fans pour the hate on Ronaldo, saying he is arrogant, dives too much, etc., but absolve Neymar of the exact same things they accuse Ronaldo of being guilty off. Hell, anyone who is a Barca fan watched the game last night would have a hard time arguing that Neymar did not earn at least two yellow cards during the game, even if you argue that the one he did earn was incorrect."
realmadrid,3a9vw3,firechaox,5,Thu Jun 18 11:27:39 2015 UTC,"Agree completely. But more than Neymar, more than Dunga, the blame is on CBF. Look as much as I don't like Guardiola, for personal reasons (his history with Barca) he's better than any current Brazilian coach, and has come out saying he wanted to coach us. Give him the job ffs, stop pretending we're going to win without putting in the hard work. We'll only be champions again once we've been humbled a bit, and understand that talent without hard work won't get us anywhere."

realmadrid,3ab7e9,brazenrumraisin,27,Fri Jun 19 00:13:56 2015 UTC,Not much to say. Ronaldo is still one of the top two players in the world and far and away is better than everyone else other than Messi. While it is true that he played worse near the end fatigue was probably a huge reason why he struggled. With the arrival of Benitez and his rotations I would expect him to sustain his impact throughout the season.
realmadrid,3ab7e9,KatsuraYuuki,7,Thu Jun 18 19:16:00 2015 UTC,"I'm hoping that is the case as well, he usually likes to play every game so hopefully he will buy into Benitez's idea of limiting his game time to keep him fit.  A fit, motivated and happy Ronaldo is how we will win trophies this year."
realmadrid,3ab7e9,pythagean,9,Thu Jun 18 22:48:47 2015 UTC,"Very unlikely, Ronaldo needs his minutes, he wants to score a hat trick every game, sure he is human and needs rest but his drive also comes from how successful he is individually so he has to play every game to increase the goal tally and that can only be good for us."
realmadrid,3ab7e9,daxl70,1 point,Fri Jun 19 00:11:12 2015 UTC,I disagree. Ronaldo has matured quite a bit on that front. I think he's more about for team success now than individual achievements if his team is losing.

realmadrid,3ab7e9,daxl70,1 point,Fri Jun 19 15:57:22 2015 UTC,"Well of course he cares, I'm not saying he doesn't care, I'm saying he cares more when his team win. Didn't he say he'd rather trade his pichichi for a league title? I think that's still true. Now he focuses more on assisting, more teamwork, etc. We can't exactly call him selfish anymore and I think he would agree if Benitez told him that reducing would mean that the team could win more."

realmadrid,3ab7e9,brazenrumraisin,10,Sun Jun 21 04:15:59 2015 UTC,"Ronaldo literally carried us to victory when the team was having a bad game which was often. That run he had with James against atletico thag led to the chicharito goal was awesome. Against schalke where we were almost eliminated at home he scored for us. When he was getting boo's from home fans he won us games, when people wanted him dropped from the first team for not scoring  he won us games with assists. Against juventus he almost came trough again in the second half at home where his cross found bales head but bale couldn't keep it down .   People talking about selling ronaldo before his contract is up are crazy. We already got our money back from what we paid for him in his shirt sales during the first couple of seasons. Sure we could make more money off of  him if we sold him but the team needs ronaldo."
realmadrid,3ab7e9,BatosaiGeneral,10,Fri Jun 19 07:52:13 2015 UTC,"Ronaldo had another great season and he kinda hobbled to the finish line. He has seen a transition a little bit closer to a true 9 and he scored some goals that were really goals you would expect out of a number 9. Some of the headers like the one against Sevilla really come into mind.  Where Ronaldo struggled was against teams that sat extremely deep and took away his space in the final third. He is still extremely agile and nimble with the ball, but he is not good enough to dribble through a team like that. He is much more suited for those long 45 yard counter attacking runs.  I don't think I like Ronaldo as a lone striker (at least IRL, FIFA is another story let me tell you). I think he needs to be either on the wing more similar to last year, or in a 442 type situation with Benzema.  Another thing I think is important is his link up play with Bale is poor. They are bad together and I believe this is what lost the tie vs Juventus. They were great in the 433 of the 2013/2014 season, but they are not strikers to be played together. Without Benzema, there seems to be such a disconnect there, it's just hard to explain without showing.  Another thing I have seen is grumblings of a selling. I don't know that I would take any offers this year. However, if next offseason comes around and we get a 150 mil bid from PSG, that might be a smart deal to take. He isn't getting younger, he has the knee issues, and that would give us an opportunity to really set up our squad for many years. It's still really hard to sell the best Real Madrid player of this century though so idk. Luckily for me I'm not in charge of this decision."
realmadrid,3ab7e9,ChedduhBob,21,Thu Jun 18 18:18:53 2015 UTC,Talk about selling Ronaldo here should be considered blasphemy :p

realmadrid,3ab7e9,Commandophile,12,Fri Jun 19 03:53:40 2015 UTC,I don't think I'd sell him. He's a great leader always gives 100 percent and his competitive nature keeps him motivated. I think having him around would definitely be a good idea at least for the youngsters and it's not like we need the money or that there's any other forward to spend it on.

realmadrid,3ab7e9,kaspar737,6,Fri Jun 19 11:51:24 2015 UTC,"His season was spectacular. Had so much fun watching him. Thing to look for now is how the club handles him going forward. If we want to extenend his stellar play for a number of years then he simply cant play 90 minutes for 60 games anymore. His body will betray him sooner rather than later if we do. He is a a physical speciemein and a hell of a footballer and I just think we should do as much as we can to perserve it.   I like what I hear about Rafa and having a minutes plan for him, I think that will do wonders along with his rotation policy. Madrid under Rafa has got to figure out how to share his burden. I mean our attack under Ancelotti was so pathetic at times. It was basically: Work the ball up the pitch, get it out wide, cross... Rinse, wash, Repeat. One of the things I watched about Ronaldo this season was his positioning. Man it is truly remarkable, his positioning and movement in the final third is truly astounding and it got us so many goals...but the way we played we failed to get the most out of our other players. Mainly Bale, and even Benzema and Isco at times. We have way to much talent to not be winning the league but the way we started to attack became so elementary and it showed against better opponents...This must change.  Anyway this is supposed to be about King Naldo and I always run out of adjectives to describe this man. He can play any type of way and do it all on the pitch. You know he will produce and I don't see even a hint of a drop off in quality next season. Truly the best."
realmadrid,3ab7e9,jmanjumpman,2,Thu Jun 18 21:58:07 2015 UTC,"He's had a phenomenal season.  I just want to go over the very few negative points regarding him though.  This season, the worst thing that happened to us were the losses against Atletico in all competitions. They isolated him perfectly and his lack of tracking back really hurt us in those games in particular. While the tactic would work against 90% of the teams, his eventual re-positioning to a striker is going to benefit everyone including himself. Against Armenia, we saw him pretty much play as the striker (furthest up the pitch, as can be seen on his 2 goals in open play). By limiting his defensive duties we have a more dangerous scorer who doesn't leave a hole behind them.   Now if the rumors are to be believed, and that Benitez plans on playing a 4231 with Bale on the left and James on the right, we will have very good balance defensively, even if Kroos continues to be the ""DM"". This will help Ronaldo tremendously as he gets older, not having to run as much or track back as much.  To answer your questions:   He exceeded my expectations. I thought this would be the year he would start to slow down.. and he goes and breaks his own records for scoring! I see him as the striker next season, maybe on another team in 3 years though. His best moment was the hat trick away to Sevilla. Super clutch Ronaldo"

realmadrid,3ab7e9,goabdulaziz,1 point,Thu Jun 18 18:19:15 2015 UTC,"He, along with Messi, is a class above everyone else around at the moment.  These two are incredibly special and I find it disheartening that often times fans of one of the clubs they play for (really aiming this one at the Barca crowd) discredit the other.   From years of watching both of these guys I can honestly say that the space between them is quite small, especially when compared to everyone below them.  I enjoy the educated arguments surrounding these two because it really only helps to remind me of how happy I am to have seen these two from the start.  All that being said, I think Cristiano really is the best on the planet, reason being, his playing off the ball.  We could sit here and talk all day about the brilliant plays he makes with the ball at his feet and yet we rarely discuss the fact that he is absurdly intelligent on the pitch without even having to be near the ball."
realmadrid,3ab7e9,Commandophile,1 point,Fri Jun 19 03:52:28 2015 UTC,"If you exclude all games in which he didn't score a hat trick, he still would have led several elite leagues in goals. I think he's worth keeping."

Much like every other Madridista, I was worried Carlo would kinda sorta drive Isco away.  Back when Robben played for us, I remember occasionally critiquing him as being selfish and unwilling to pass.  Early into Di Maria's tenure I felt the same.  Lord knows those two really ended up flourishing down the line and what I see in Isco is the same as what I saw in them.  A haughty kid who yearns to impress, sometimes at the cost of the team.  I think he will only get better as the years go buy and it is up to us to nurture him because as great as he is now, I really think he has plenty more to offer."

The major peñas support the club as a whole, Casillas included.  I went to a game at the end of last year previous to the UCL, I've been to the Bernabeu twice (no game since) since I have family in Madrid.  The environment is the same as ever. You have your group of people who'll never be happy, a MINORITY. You have your suckers que consumen la mierda de AS, Marca, etc. and can't differentiate between TABLOIDS and journalism.   But the majority are happy. Show me the contrary if you can. Or move along.  edit:   QuestionFinding a job as an 18yr old high schooler? (self.shanghai) submitted 5 months ago by abouchedid Back in America I could have had a small job like at a restaurant as a waiter or something else of the sort. Is it possible to find such jobs here in Shanghai?   Conflicto de informacion? El historial habla por sí mismo."
realmadrid,3a74j4,joevaded,5,Wed Jun 17 21:21:35 2015 UTC,"Just to be clear, there seems to be nothing definite about this. AS is merely saying surgery might be an option.  Edit: After short research I read that without surgery it usually takes about 8 weeks recovery time."
realmadrid,3a74j4,KeiserSoze24,3,Wed Jun 17 19:33:12 2015 UTC,Our guys are dropping like flies. This is scary.
realmadrid,3a74j4,jacobo,3,Thu Jun 18 04:49:17 2015 UTC,Keylor is such a great player and person. I hope he gets better.

realmadrid,3a6jn1,DeletoiD,8,Wed Jun 17 16:53:56 2015 UTC,Good buy if they do so. I mean.. Pepe being 33. Varane will probably get more playing time this season. Oh well.. I'm just eating my popcorn and see what the transfers will be.
realmadrid,3a6jn1,Lewanrobski,4,Wed Jun 17 17:02:41 2015 UTC,"Would be a good replacement for Pepe, who probably only has a season or two left, and Ramos isn't exactly young either. If Benitez wants to rotate as much as people say, this would be huge."
realmadrid,3a6jn1,ChedduhBob,3,Wed Jun 17 19:40:29 2015 UTC,Like I said we can use a spare center back
realmadrid,3a6jn1,goabdulaziz,0,Wed Jun 17 19:45:46 2015 UTC,Doubt it. He seems pretty dead set on united. And with rojo there I doubt he'll pass up that opportunity.

realmadrid,3a33xu,KingJamesX,10,Tue Jun 16 21:14:17 2015 UTC,God damn he's like Jesus. Always sticking up for the little guy. 😍😍😍
realmadrid,3a33xu,jokingbirch,6,Wed Jun 17 01:16:30 2015 UTC,What a douche!    Didn't even give them his own jersey!
realmadrid,3a33xu,dcfc_90,3,Wed Jun 17 02:52:10 2015 UTC,"Awful kind of him, the taller kid seemed so excited haha"
realmadrid,3a33xu,BluePineapple19,-5,Wed Jun 17 03:04:13 2015 UTC,Giving reward to illegal activity like this just fuels more people to keep doing it. One deadly attack will be all it takes for this to be taken more serious. (like a shank stabbing someone)
realmadrid,3a33xu,MyNeckHasABeard,8,Wed Jun 17 05:13:06 2015 UTC,"You shouldn't be downvoted for this, it's true. I love the guy but I cringed like fuck when he hugged that pitch invader in Miami that time. When someone has gone to those kind of lengths to get access and broken several physical and other boundaries, and then you REWARD them for it, it could get nasty.   My dad is a psychiatrist and used to do behavior analysis for security firms and things like that/forensics, he always freaks out at the screen when anyone hugs a pitch invader, an adult one anyway.  It's not like the person could do something then and there, so much as they might take their reward as a sign that they can break other boundaries, like turning up at their house, because they got their hug and chat last time right? Or someone else with not such nice intentions could be watching and see how easy it is.  It's different with children obviously, but that guy in Miami was a fully grown man, and there have been others, way too old to be behaving like that. It's very dangerous behavior. I hate seeing people applauding them for hugging and interacting with these people.   Monica Selas the tennis player WAS stabbed by an obsessed fan of a rival during a game. (equivalent to a Ronaldo fan stabbing Messi kind of thing) It's like nobody has learnt from that at all."

realmadrid,3a33xu,BagelsAndJewce,1 point,Wed Jun 17 11:42:47 2015 UTC,"Yes but they're putting the people they love so much at risk by doing that. Not kids obviously, because they're kids haha, but adults. Athletes are the easiest celebrities to stalk, we know where they are going to be months in advance, we know where they train, where their stadium is, thanks to the tabloids we know where they live as well.   Someone running onto the pitch and being rewarded with a hug and a chat, is not only messing up a game, but they are showing people who don't have the nicest of intentions how easy it is. By being super nice to them the player could be saying to someone who is truly obsessed that ""if you break my boundaries, I will reward you"". It's dangerous and if people love them so much they need to think about that."
realmadrid,3a34yw,KingJamesX,17,Tue Jun 16 21:21:28 2015 UTC,What a great guy. I hope he spends his whole career with Madrid
realmadrid,3a34yw,Bustamente20,11,Wed Jun 17 02:04:20 2015 UTC,How I wish I was a young Colombian kid..
realmadrid,3a34yw,lemadridist4,2,Tue Jun 16 21:41:26 2015 UTC,this kid is from Chile :)
realmadrid,3a34yw,jacobo,8,Wed Jun 17 23:04:56 2015 UTC,kid reppin' the fake jersey!
realmadrid,3a34yw,Pauly-G,4,Wed Jun 17 03:20:08 2015 UTC,A small kid doesn't care if it's fake or real. He just love Real Madrid and that's it. All this pride of authenticity and show-off is grown up thing.
realmadrid,3a34yw,rishinator,4,Wed Jun 17 15:34:35 2015 UTC,are you calling out a kid in a developing country for wearing a fake jersey smh
realmadrid,3a34yw,dabumtsss,6,Thu Jun 18 03:50:03 2015 UTC,"I am Colombian, the reporter is from Colombia too but what stupid questions he asks.  Clearly the kid is crying because he just met his idol, he is happy and the guy keeps asking Why are you crying? DUH!"
realmadrid,3a4byo,fanfare_mp3,1 point,Wed Jun 17 03:12:31 2015 UTC,No. They will tour Asia in July and in August they will play two games in Germany. They won't play in Spain before the start of the season in mid-to-late August.
realmadrid,3a4byo,DeletoiD,3,Wed Jun 17 06:18:01 2015 UTC,Thanks for the info. As long as CR7 is expected to play in Germany I think I can manage to extend my trip for a bit.
realmadrid,3a12jf,AlbumTalarium,3,Tue Jun 16 11:53:58 2015 UTC,This situation is only gonna unfold itself. Which takes time and quite honestly I can see this saga ending at the end of next season. The Man doesn't want to leave and the club doesn't want to show him the door.
realmadrid,3a12jf,neklos,1 point,Wed Jun 17 04:18:56 2015 UTC,"Casillas' desire to ""win"" (compete for starter position with DDG) causes more harm than good to the team. DDG isn't guaranteed first choice when he clearly should be, which hinders the current transfer negotiations and limits his minutes/form.   Casillas should see his place now like how Raul did, and know that even legends can walk out with honour."
realmadrid,3a12jf,AlexDimitrios,-2,Tue Jun 16 22:35:04 2015 UTC,Why would conpetition hurt De Gea when he is clearly superior?
realmadrid,3a12jf,moklboy,-13,Wed Jun 17 08:30:06 2015 UTC,So we getting Diego López Rodríguez back :)?
realmadrid,3a12jf,Melicalol,-5,Tue Jun 16 17:28:44 2015 UTC,This thread is about Iker Casillas and his desire to continue. What does this have to do with a player who opted to leave?
