malelifestyle,3dvjnn,alphahec,7,Sun Jul 19 21:53:12 2015 UTC,"This is phenomenal, I'm a big proponent of this. I use Habit List and Daily Routine to help automate my routine which consists of personal hygiene, supplements, exercise, meditation, DuoLingo, journaling, reading, and nutrition. Like  u/Tim-Ferris says, an actor should be able to preform your routine indistinguishably."
malelifestyle,3dvjnn,thedabbler,3,Mon Jul 20 00:04:26 2015 UTC,Could you go into more depth with how you use those apps to automate things? I forgot to do things in my routine or habits I'm trying to create all the time.
malelifestyle,3dvjnn,ZerowithanH,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:30:26 2015 UTC,"Sure thing! Sorry for the delayed reply. I use the two apps for two distinct usecases:  -Habit List: Binary Y/N of if I did a task that day.  In the app you set up all tasks/habits you want to do and assign frequency being daily, specific days, specific times per week regardless of what specific day it is, etc. For example, brushing your teeth will hopefully be a daily task but something like cardio could be set for Monday, Wednesday, Friday, or any 3 days/week, or every two days.  I have several habits that I do daily: Read, medidate, journal, etc. And some I do on specific days: Cardio, weight train, yoga  -Daily Routine: When I allot to do that test. This app is made up of routines and timeslots. A timeslot is a single activity like working out or eating breakfast. A routine is a combination of multiple timeslots. I assign a time it takes me to complete all my habits for the day and then make routines for each day of the week. I know that I want to do 10 minutes of meditation, journaling, and language learning daily, along with an hour of weight training M/W/F. I also want to get 7 hours of sleep, and I plan at being at work for 8 hours. This means all my M/W/Fs look pretty much the same. Here is what one looks like:  0630-0655: Wake up, dress, leave for gym 0655-0805: 1 hour lift weights, 10 min roundtrip commute to gym 0805-0815: Meditate (great way to cool my body down after the gym) 0815-0825: Duolingo 0825-0845: Read 0845-915: Shower/dress/tidy up apt 0915-0930: Commute to work 0930-530: Work (my work Outlook calendar will take over my hour-by-hour here)  I like knocking out all my habits before I get to the office.   Does the above make sense?"

malelifestyle,3dr6gv,UncleDucker,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:23:40 2015 UTC,"Of the two forward positions in basketball, the power forward plays on the block, as opposed to the small forward who plays on the wing. In defense both forward positions play the wing in a 2-3 defense but in a 3-2 defense only the power forward shares the paint duty with the 5 while the 3 moves up to the perimeter zones with the 1 and the 2. Typically in the UCLA offense the 4 spot initiates a triple post offense. In classic sense the 4 grabs boards while the 5 protects the rim. Hope that answers your question."

malelifestyle,3djdou,ABeardShop,5,Thu Jul 16 23:59:37 2015 UTC,"This is not entirely true, for $4K you're basically building a shed, since proper windows, a door, electrical and plumbing fixtures (if you choose to put them in) would all raise the cost by a fair amount. The plans also do not include vapor barrier and insulation, which would be necessary in a lot of climates, as would a fireplace. All in all, it seems like a fairly good design for a cabin, smaller houses for people on a budget are becoming more and more popular, and hopefully designs like these will encourage people to build their own houses, which is pretty much the manliest thing you can do"
malelifestyle,3djdou,anon_na_mouse,2,Thu Jul 16 20:20:30 2015 UTC,Exactly the point of my post too.  The things (including having land) you'd need to actually make this livable in any climate where the temp drops below 60 would quickly make this not much less than just buying something already built and probably a fair bit bigger.  I bet this would actually be a fair bit more expensive in many areas (obviously building costs and needs vary wildly from city to city)
malelifestyle,3djdou,DigiSmackd,2,Thu Jul 16 20:43:20 2015 UTC,"This would pair well with a mining claim. In California (and I think AZ is similar), you can get a mining claim as a way to enjoy some property out in nature without the pros and cons of real ownership. Usually, you just have to put at least $100 or so of developments into your claim each year to keep it.   I think something this size would work better for an occasional use property where you don't have to have full luxuries or conveniences installed, which would raise the cost a lot.  So, pair a project like this with a mining claim and you can have a camping cabin in beautiful wilderness for less than $10k, before waiting till you're old and wealthy enough to buy it yourself. Also, claims are sellable, so it wouldn't be a sunk cost, but something that holds some value. I think it would be a blast to build with family or a couple friends."

Lower, where is the test for writing needs to be higher. Tables with sliding keyboard racks under the tabletop are clunky. There is no best set up bc of this if you need to type and write. In general such simple guidelines are repeated elsewhere but I'm skeptical of their utility. For example, chairs with lumbar support R theoretically helpful because they take off stress from your lower back, would like so many other things that are touted by so called experts, the exact opposite may be true. Lumbar support takes the weight off support muscles, so who is to say you are not weakening those muscles over time and thus putting yourself at risk for lower back pain more than if those muscles were in use? This isn't to say it's not good to have lumbar support but where's the evidence for it? And before someone start posting studies to support it, I suspect such studies are low in power and the results suspect."

malelifestyle,3d20c8,internutthead,2,Mon Jul 13 15:27:06 2015 UTC,"I started simple. One time playing volleyball, I realized I was the only one on my team that couldn't reach his or her toes from a standing position. I slowly started doing it in the shower every morning. Slowly but surely I was able to touch my ankles, then toes, now I can hold my palm flat on the floor in front of me.  I decided that I've got too big a belly to put my head between my knees, but I'm close.  Next step is to focus on back stretches like found in this video. My lower back hurts and nearly has been thrown out due to being weak and tight, and I'm only just in my thirties. Not a good thing.  Also, I want to be able to do the splits. I think a 6'3"", 300lb guy doing the splits would look funny and great. I bet I could use it to impress women, too. Get my Jean Claude Van Damme on."
malelifestyle,3d206v,lucubratious,9,Sun Jul 12 21:50:15 2015 UTC,"Lol jesus. Terrible examples in this article.  NBA Super stars refuse to sign with the New York because of how their franchise has run the last 15 years. Their front office is TERRIBLE at drafting, last great draft pick was Patrick Ewing. The one competent team they had during the 2010 free agency they signed Amare Stoudamire, a great line up that was eventually gutted for Carmelo Anthony, they had their worse franchise record last season (due to Carmelo's injury) but injuries happen.  Knicks are rebuilding, though Phil Jackson wants to acquire stars, not a lot of guys like their situation and are busy chasing rings."

malelifestyle,3d206v,goatjames,3,Sun Jul 12 23:06:51 2015 UTC,"Possibly, they're last draft pick to be an All Star was  David Lee in 2005 who later left in the 2010 Free Agency to the Warriors where he eventually got a ring this year.  I agree with Isiah. Guys like Danilo Gallinari, Wilson Chandler, Trevor Ariza and Tim Hardaway Jr were good draft picks but were traded away instead of building a solid core through the draft. Unless Porzingus is amazing for them, they're likely a first round exit if they even make it to the post season."
malelifestyle,3d206v,Angrymanager,2,Sun Jul 12 23:35:25 2015 UTC,"Gallinari has been injury plagued his entire career. Hardaway is a ""shooter"" who shot less than 40% from the field and has no other discernible skills. Seriously, he was terrible. Chandler is a role player.  These guys weren't going to build a championship contender.  I don't think anyone expects the Knicks to win the championship this year. A first round exit sounds like the best case scenario. Phil is building for 2-4 years into the future."

I can tell (and so can most interviewers) if you are just looking for ANY job or if the job I am interviewing for is interesting to you.   none of this is mentioned in the tips.

malelifestyle,3cmxio,lucubratious,1 point,Thu Jul 9 22:42:14 2015 UTC,"Access =/= the right to the money. Divorce proceedings give rise to property rights. However, he does need to get deposit slips etc for the time they were married to show what was contributed to the account by him.  Other than that it's going to matter what state he lives in. I believe its somewhere between 10-15 states that have community property laws saying assets/debt will be split during a divorce. The other 40 or so states have equitable distribution laws, which basically means the court will split up assets/debt in a way which is deemed ""fair."" Either way he needs to get proof showing what he contributed/owned before the marriage and what he contributed during the marriage."
malelifestyle,3cmxio,sr71Girthbird,1 point,Thu Jul 9 22:46:00 2015 UTC,"That's assuming full proceedings take place to determine asset distribution in the first place, which is a very expensive point to get to. You're taking the full-on legal battle side of this and giving him advice not knowing the amount of money taken or which state he lives in. (Attorney's fees could easily go over the amount of money she took.)  The fact of the matter is - if you are an owner of a bank account (not a signer, not a beneficiary...an OWNER) it is legally your money. If they have a joint checking account, they both own it.  He should, however, obtain account statements which show deposits and distributions to and from the account."

Vigorous scrubbing of dirty dishes helped bleed some adrenaline out, and the separation helped too. Before I was even finished, she had come up behind me, given me one of those hugs from behind she didn't know I liked so much, and apologized for arguing. We were able to calmly resolve it, whatever it was, while working together to finish the dishes.  Very solid advice in this article."

And while there may be a correlation in that direction, it's not a universal truth with beer. Far from it."

malelifestyle,3birw7,KFBass,4,Tue Jun 30 00:47:13 2015 UTC,Ok here's one..  what's the difference between porter and stout ?  Is there a definitive line between the two ?  I've read up on it and understand the difference but it's a question that comes up frequently in my circles.
malelifestyle,3birw7,homedude,3,Tue Jun 30 01:19:35 2015 UTC,"It's certainly getting blurry, but here is my take on it. Stout, like a dry stout specifically, will have a more roasty character, vs a porter having more of a chocolate and sweetness to it.  Historically people made ""stout porters"" and then it just evolved from there. It's a very blurry line now and almost comes down to regional differences.  For instance, in my region I can get guiness and fullers london porter at any time. Those are the two I think of when I think of an everyday stout and porter. Somebody on the west coast might think of anchor porter, and anderson valley oatmeal stout as their go to."

malelifestyle,3birw7,homedude,3,Tue Jun 30 18:40:50 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind that the color of beer is not a reliable indicator of flavor, strength, or even style.

Drawing is cool too. Recommend Drawing the Head and Figure by Jack Hamm to get started. It's similar to whittling, just on paper.   Another great one is mountain biking.

malelifestyle,39jhx8,Noire1337,4,Fri Jun 12 14:51:44 2015 UTC,To the best of my understanding it knows which wheel needs to spin faster because both wheels are attached to the same body.   If you imagine the car turning a corner is actually moving part of the way round a circle you can measure the distance travelled by calculating it based off the radius of the circle and the change in angle.   Both the outside wheel and the inside wheel need to move the same amount in terms of angle because their both fixed to the one car body.   The outside wheel however has a greater radius hence a greater distance to travel. Hence it will automatically need to move faster in order to move the same angle in the same amount of time as the inner wheel. (you can't have the outside edge of the car and the inside edge arrive at the destination at different times).  So now you have two wheels moving at different speeds along the one axle. The differential is just allowing for this to happen without causing one of the wheels to slide.   I have no idea if this made things clearer.

malelifestyle,39jhx8,devDoron,1 point,Fri Jun 12 22:00:35 2015 UTC,Going to be honest I have no idea what those are. I imagine they're just variants on the differential seen here that provide some kind of performance benefit.
malelifestyle,39jhx8,68ant,1 point,Sat Jun 13 03:02:18 2015 UTC,"They limit torque and thus power to wheels that are slipping and direct it to the wheel with traction. If you put a car on a lift, hold one wheel still and turn the car on the opposite wheel will still turn. Well imagine the wheel you are holding is on dry pavement and the other is on ice. You would have trouble going anywhere. The limited slip diff will slow down or reduce power to the spinning wheel and force the wheel with traction to turn. You probably wouldn't want to be holding that wheel. Here's a really good video that explains one basic type"
malelifestyle,39jhx8,AgentMullWork,1 point,Sat Jun 13 04:06:25 2015 UTC,"Among better answers, I can tell you that modern differentials simply give better traction, more adjustability, electronically changing the diff, etc.  Some differentials allow you to control how much slip/traction you'll get under power (1.0), under coast (lifting - 1.5 or 2, depending on half or full adjustability, as well as ""e-diffs"" that modern supercars have. The best example are Ferrari's with their Manetino switch that goes from Normal to Sport to Race, etc. It allows progressively more slip due to allowing your throttle inputs to be less interrupted.  With all the power of modern supercars, the differentials and traction control systems (among other active systems) simply allow you to get that power to the ground."
malelifestyle,39jhx8,SlowRollingBoil,2,Mon Jun 15 13:25:10 2015 UTC,"My knowledge of this is limited mostly to that video so bear with me - anyone who really knows this stuff feel free to correct me.  It doesn't 'know' which wheel needs more spins. You're thinking about this backwards. The differential doesn't give more power to the faster spinning wheel; it gives as much power as is needed to the slowest wheel. What it does do is it allows the faster spinning wheel to spin as fast as it needs to. It doesn't give any more power to that faster wheel.  It might make more sense if you think about it in terms of power instead of spins. The engine is providing a certain amount of power to the back wheels. When the car is going straight, each wheel is getting exactly half the power. When it goes around a turn over, each wheel gets: half the power! What the differential does is it allows the faster moving wheel on the outside of the turn to move faster. However, the power that engine provides to that wheel is exactly the same."

malelifestyle,39eksy,theen,11,Thu Jun 11 08:54:21 2015 UTC,As a person who has spent his life dealing with depression I agree. Talking isn't enough. But the truth is many times there's nothing someone else can do.    “Suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem.” – Robin Williams   It's an inspirational longer but wrong. Depression can and many times is a problem. It's something I'm going to have to continue fighting for the rest of my life. It's a part of me.
malelifestyle,39eksy,lenaxia,4,Thu Jun 11 13:43:31 2015 UTC,"Sometimes depression is situational. It's not just in your head, and there is something people could do to help that is more than just listening. The trick is if someone is actually willing to do it."
malelifestyle,39eksy,anonlymouse,2,Thu Jun 11 15:47:14 2015 UTC,“Suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem.” – Robin Williams   I agree with what you are saying but it's odd to see you attribute that saying to Robin Williams.  I think he used the line in a movie less than 10 years ago.  The phrase has been used for at least 25 years

But I don't believe that's exactly what this is talking about. I believe this is talking about those moments when you are overwhelmed and suicide seems like the most attractive option. Depression is often the road to get to that point, but I believe the ""temporary problem"" is the low point, not the depression itself. That's how I interpreted it, at least."

malelifestyle,37zto9,CryenallPM,10,Mon Jun 1 00:02:27 2015 UTC,"The instrument idea is a good one, I think. I'm a pianist in my spare time and I've found developing that skill quite fulfilling and pleasurable. The trick is merely to keep yourself excited about all of the new music you can access as you get better. You're not going to start out playing piano concertos, but even something like a minuet is easily possible in less than six months. Not only that, but learning an instrument (piano and voice are the easiest to start, I reckon) can lead to other fun pursuits like composing.   Relaxing for me is getting out of the house, though. I started hiking when I was a strapping young lad, but that slowly evolved into trail-running. I adore it. The fresh air, the smell of the woods, moving quietly under the shadows of trees, the cool air over my sweat, the challenge of a good incline, pumping something inspiring over my headphones, it's all just so different from the normal dredges of day to day life. It's escaping into the past, almost, like chasing down prey 20,000 years ago. And nothing gives me an endorphin release quite like a really exhilarating trail run. When I get home, I feel absolutely amazing, and I sleep like a piece of iron.   If exercise isn't your thing... well, make it your thing. Exercise is like eating: necessary but also something you can enjoy if you apply a little effort.   Aside from that, I really enjoy dating. While dating made me a nervous wreck back when I was a teenager, now it's really just a lot of fun. You meet someone new, flirt a little, have a nice long talk or two to enjoy each others company, ask her out or be asked out, and just spend time with an interesting and attractive person to see if there's a connection. For me, it's rest because it recharges me after working really hard all day. Eat at a nice restaurant or have a picnic, go for a leisurely walk, maybe see a show, see what happens.   The only thing I can't really speak to is legitimate vacations. I have no idea how to vacation, but people seem pretty relaxed when they go on vacation."

I listen to a lot of science and philosophical podcasts. The Skeptic's Guide to the Universe, Freakonomics, RadioLab, Quackcast, StarTalk, For Good Reason, Evolution Talk and The Partially Examined Life are some of my favorites. RadioLab and Freakonomics are pretty standard but for very good reason. Serial is great too but that should be taken in short doses. Dude Soup and Inside Gaming are good for video game fans, though best viewed on YouTube, in my opinion. A Podcast of Ice and Fire is good for Westeros and The British History Podcast is very interesting. This was a one off but it's on iTunes's podcast section: Stephen Fry's Planet Word. It's basically Stephen Fry talking about one of his favorite subjects. That's all i got and it fits my tastes which are not for everyone. Sorry if they aren't to your taste."

malelifestyle,37zto9,Zokleen,2,Mon Jun 1 13:38:52 2015 UTC,"I stopped skating once I started my university studies due to a lack of time. Always missed skating though. After watching ""The motivation"" on Netflix a few weeks back I decided to stop thinking about it, and just get out there :-)  I was surprised how quickly I got back into the groove, but my skill level has never been that advanced. Nonetheless, with the advent of YouTube and other online educational sources I hope to advance my ramp skating.  The only thing that bugs me is the psychological aspects of skating. When I was in my teens I had no problem doing Rock-to-fakie and similar ""trucks over the coping"" tricks. However, messed up my foot badly one summer day and since then I haven't been able to push my skills on technical tricks.. Also, I think it will be a while before I get back into vert skating, heh."

There are days where I feel amazing and land stuff on point, but there are others where I still have that tiny feeling of fear and I can't commit to anything. Those days are pretty frustrating, but then at the end of the day I still got a solid workout and thats more than most people do in a week. Also, being able to overcome that mental block and riding away from something you've been trying for an hour plus is probably the best feeling ever."

Rock to fakies are much easier if you do them little by little, like just roll up to the coping and try slapping it with your front truck. Also, my best tip for any type of flip or anything is to practice on grass first, also learned how to pop ollies really high this way :) go find a patch of grass and get at it!

She was shocked it happened so quickly. She knew it was coming, but wasn't expecting for another six months. Frankly, that's about the timeline I was thinking.

malelifestyle,36zwh1,blankedinmyblank,14,Sun May 24 02:23:24 2015 UTC,Honestly. I think the best way is to simply be mindful about it. The more you think about it the more of a reminder you're giving yourself. Eventually you'll swear less and less.
malelifestyle,36zwh1,ReFreshing,6,Sat May 23 15:54:44 2015 UTC,That's been my approach. I've noticed a slight decline but it's mostly when I'm around a group of people. I'll notice myself slipping.

malelifestyle,36zwh1,Frognosticator,5,Sat May 23 19:18:28 2015 UTC,"Hey OP,  I struggled with this a bit myself a few years ago when I got out of college and had to join the real world. There are a few things you can do:   Eliminate sources where you hear the words you don't want to use. If you're partial to certain music or TV shows you know are full of bad language, stop watching/listening to them, at least until you have your own language under control. Eliminate it from your work first, and your home life second. It's a lot easier to make the transition  in small doses. When you've learned to check yourself hard around your boss and coworkers, then make the same transition when you're around your wife. Don't worry about it so much when you go out with your friends. Being able to blow off steam will actually help with the transition, as long as you have the discipline to segregate those parts of your life. Find substitute words for exclamations. When something goes wrong, I've learned to throw out a ""dadgummit,"" ""good lord,"" or ""oh for the love of..."" when other people are within ear shot. Unfortunately, I haven't found anything that's quite as satisfying as letting loose a string of choice four letter words when stuff really hits the fan, but I' very learned to save those for when I'm alone. Start reading books. Dependence on swear words is usually the result of not being comfortable using the full range of your vocabulary. If you read a book a month or so, you'll quickly learn new ways to express your ideas without the curse words. Just stay away from the Game of Thrones books.   Hope this helps."
malelifestyle,36zwh1,xal1124,4,Sat May 23 18:22:11 2015 UTC,I actually just used your advice and downloaded Word Replacer chrome extension - changed all the 'bad' words to cleaner versions.

I hear them on the VHF calling for tugs and announcing they are going to need one hours in advance. With AIS onboard all these craft the tugs already know where they are and when they will need tugboat assistance.   The Z flag does have some interesting history behind it however.   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z_flag

malelifestyle,35k9ke,Berto_,1 point,Wed May 13 16:06:42 2015 UTC,"Let's see. I thing the easiest way to learn the basics is to either look it all up online or buy a cocktail recipe book that tells you what everything is and what it is commonly used for. If names are your thing then you might either study the index to learn what ingredients a drink has (like the black and tan) or what I think is more important, the main source of alcohol in a drink. The reason I say that is so you get a feel for which hard liquors you like and which you could do without. Same goes for liqueurs or flavored liquors; knowing you aren't a big licorice fan will let you know not to drink anisette, jagermeister, ouzo, or absinthe. Learn the large groupings of drinks by their content and after you have those down start playing with different drinks that have your favorite ingredients and you'll be a pro in no time."

For a cheap, just-getting-introduced, model Id suggest the Mossberg 500 (M500). The quality is fantastic and the only thing that makes it feel ""cheap"" is the thin (relatively) plastic that also makes it so lightweight. It's not so thin as to affect performance but if you want something that feels substantial, get the wooden stock. Also, no true waterfowl hunter would keep a pump action without upgrading to an auto. The pumps are just great to learn on as far as appreciating how many times you're shooting.   The 870 used to be a fantastic gun but their quality has dropped enormously. Benelli is superb but it's probably overkill as a starter shotgun and something you should consider upgrading to. With that said, you really can't go wrong with one either. In practice I've been the type who buys the overkill option simply because I could afford the better equipment; but it always outperforms my level of ability making it kind of silly."

It's different in the sense that you understand your role within the organization and how initially you are a liability to the company, but potentially a huge asset. It also shows that you know how to prioritize your efforts to make sure you are doing what makes the company efficient and not distracted by pet projects.   Also, to help with your career, when you know how much value you are to a business it's going to be easier to negotiate your salary. If you just negotiate your salary on your emotions; it's not going to work very well. There are clear defined profitabilities for many jobs, and knowing those is power."

I say this because lists like seem to see the history of jazz through the lens of miles Davis, instead of seeing Davis as the culmination of a subgenre of jazz and the creator of new movements in jazz. I see only 1 or 2 jazz vocalists which is ridiculous as vocalists were an important part of popular jazz for a long time.  Also no brubeck who was probably the most popular jazz musician of his era. To me these lists are the classical-ization of jazz, pushing vocalists and catchy popular jazz to the back. That is very unfortunate."

malelifestyle,32l00e,Blahblahblahinternet,2,Wed Apr 15 00:21:40 2015 UTC,I hate to say it but if hobbies feel like work you're doing it wrong.  Hobbies are meant to be something you enjoy to do on your free time.  So if you have a hobby you don't enjoy you should probably find a new hobby.
malelifestyle,32l00e,whatsinthesocks,5,Wed Apr 15 05:10:12 2015 UTC,"Honestly, just  try some hobbies that some of your friends enjoy doing. It'll give you a common connection with them and something to talk about.  One of my friends is really active, so I picked up rock climbing and portaging. Some more joined in and now we have a squad of people who all go together.  Another of my friends is into books, so I started reading some books they suggested and they are pretty good. I prefer books to TV shows but you can do this with TV/Movies/Comics, whatever."

Leon Shimkin of the publishing firm Simon & Schuster took one of the 14-week courses given by Carnegie in 1934.

malelifestyle,319a72,bantha_poodoo,0,Fri Apr 3 19:28:15 2015 UTC,"So here's my take. I only get two days off per weekend. If my options were spend an entire day marching around and swiping plastic while the female loads up on clothes or anything else I'd choose anything else.   With that said. As a rule, if I'm not living with the chick and I'm not taking her shopping as a gift. If I ask ""how much are you trying to spend?"" and ""could we be out in under two hours?"" then I establish a precedent that dragging me to the mall does not instantly earn her a few hundred bucks and on a personal level if she can't respect my time then I'm not doing that.   I don't drag females out with me to buy socks, shit I don't even drag them out to buy dress clothes. I especially wouldn't expect them to pay for it... so you know the dynamic is kinda different. If I was a multi billionaire with money to burn I'd still rather have a chick come in look me in the eye and go ""hey I'd like ____ dollars to buy ____, is that cool"" rather than chiseling a day out of my life under false pretenses with the hopes that you'll get suckered or guilted into paying for that little adventure.  Given my insight into this I hope you can understand why when I see the guy shuffling from foot to foot holding his chick's purse I think he's a class one pussy. He's not even being interacted with most of the time... he's not calling shots about buy this or don't buy that. He's there to hold her purse (like a bitch) while she decides what to buy. Man to me that is a textbook neutered guy.   3.6 billion women on earth to chose from. The guy that participates in this type of behavior is making a choice. He's saying he'd gladly sacrifice a day of his existence (and possibly cash) to hopefully lock his chick down for another day so he doesn't have to try to convince one of those 3.6 billion to sleep with him. He wants the low hanging fruit.   Guys tend to get what they really go after... the low hanging fruit is of no appeal to me whatsoever. That's why I have boundaries in relationships. If you're reading this getting weepy about how I don't know what you and your chick share... I absolutely do, more importantly she does. She won't drop to her knees and blow you on command, you can't put it in her ass anytime you want; she has boundaries. The existence of those boundaries actually causes you to respect her more... if she had none, she'd be a whore right? Okay, now take that wisdom and don't be a bitch.   Women respect a guy that's a bitch about as much as men respect a chick that's a whore... respect yourself and be treated like you deserve a little respect. It's a pretty simple concept."

malelifestyle,319a72,FLOCKA,15,Fri Apr 3 03:12:39 2015 UTC,Part of the point/the entire point of being in a relationship is that you make an active effort to enjoy participating in the other person's life.

Tell her it just isn't your shtick and you have no problem with her going with her friends but that she should classify her shopping time as ""her time"" and you'll hang out with your buddies when she does it. If she doesn't agree to that then you either put up, shut up and learn to respect her interests or you find a girl that respects you and your interests.    Don't fucking mope. Grow a pair and deal with it like an adult. If you value your time so little you'd let a girl waste it like that then you deserve to sit in a corner and look like a pathetic fool.

I like to have some freedom to do things without her as well, and I would like to think that so does she. You don't have to do everything with your SO, all the time. For example I like to go birdwatching. In my free time I like to sit down, look at this and try to find one of these in a group of 10.000 of these. This is what I think is fun, my girlfriend does not. Taking her with me would not be nice for me at all because I know she's not enjoying herself. Same thing goes for me and shopping. I don't like doing it, so she goes shopping with her friends and then later we go to a concert or museum together because that's something we both enjoy. Sure, we try to let each other do new and exciting things but I know for a fact that I think shopping is boring and I know that she thinks the same way about birdwatching. I respect that opinion and don't bother her with it."
malelifestyle,319a72,ruk_hai,1 point,Fri Apr 3 14:57:50 2015 UTC,"Not sure I was clear. I think the examples you gave are all about you benefiting. Your negative counter examples are all from the perspective that the woman in your hypothetical relationship is tyrannical - simply because she'd like you to join her in an activity she enjoys. That's selfish and borderline misogynistic.   You going shopping with your significant other when you might not want to is called ""compromising"". Compromising is perhaps the strongest pillar of a healthy relationship.  You buying your girlfriend a dress because she has a nice body but not wanting to go shopping with her when she'd just like your company is shitty - it's using her for your own gain and denying her any benefits.   Why would you be in a relationship with someone with whom you wouldn't want to spend your free time? What is more important? What could be?  If anything, the ""male lifestyle"" is about being the best possible man you can be -the best possible person you can be -which in part means being a positive contributor to your relationships and understanding what the important people in your life need. And supporting what they need. Even if it means going to the goddamn mall when you don't want to. Because what you should want is to be with your significant other, and experiencing what's important to him or her.

She probably just wants to spend time with you and get some errands done at the same time. Instead, give her your opinion, make suggestions, even just tell her what looks great on her and what doesn't. She'll appreciate that a hell of a lot more.   Finally, don't ask for time expectations. That's a hugely dick move that sets the tone for you being treated this way. You're saying ""I'll only be cooperative and spend time with you for this long - so make sure you don't go over time, or else you get my tantrum"".   Grow the fuck up."

Totally, for me to pay to play I'd want to be sitting on a large pile of money though. I guess being as that I'm only 31 and not in terrible shape I don't see the need to purchase sex but I'm sure as I get older or if I were to let myself go that could change.    Finally, don't ask for time expectations. That's a hugely dick move that sets the tone for you being treated this way.    Yeah establishing any kind of boundaries or standards is wildly unethical. God, how could I? The world would be a much better place if all men were door mats... lol /s   make sure you don't go over time, or else you get my tantrum   Umm... no your psychic abilities have failed again.   My deal is that if I can't reach sort of a rhythm with a female where she's respectful of my wants/needs & finds them reasonable then I'm out. I'm too old to make a big scene. I'll be pleasant as fuck, just sugary sweet. Then after I get her ass home and get her shit packaged up... I'll just miss a few phone calls, maybe I'll establish a 4-6 hour delay on text message replies, maybe I'll limit myself to short answers... If I want ass and for whatever reason I haven't found better ass by that point maybe I'll turn on some charm and apologize for being a dick. Maybe the ass wasn't worth the trouble and I'll let things cool for a few days and then just tell her ""hey I don't think this is working out""... when she ask about picking her shit up, she won't need to... I'll UPS it, I think it'd be less ""confusing"" if we spent a little time apart.  See I'm not the bitch and moan type. I don't raise my voice. I don't complain repeatedly. When it's fucked it's fucked and that's fine because it makes it real easy to walk away. New pussy is always more fun & honestly I like the chase... I don't even know why I like it but it's fun for me.   What's not fun is never having a day I where I can set my own schedule... Time management is pretty key in my life and I think it's something that a lot of functional people have on their side. Other people like to drift through life like a ship without a rudder and just wherever they land hey that's chill... and that's great for them. Some guys don't care what chick they spend their time/money/effort on... and that's great for them. Even more guys don't really care how their chick treats them, they prove that by how they get treated... and that's fine for them.  As far as the ship without a rudder crowd you sounds like the lord of the fucking fleet... I'm serious I'm sure you're a swell guy. I just chose to live my life in a slightly more intentional way, and that kinda works for me. You be you, I'll be me... hope nothing I've said causes you emotional distress, I'm pretty open but I don't try to be hurtful. If you're the guy holding the purse and that's the highest level of happiness you think you're capable of then by all means soldier on.  I've got no interest in changing you... let's just agree to disagree on the fundaments of how a man should interact with females. Cheers."

I would wager a guess that the vast majority of guys going shopping with their girls aren't paying for all the clothes they get.  If you are, it's incredibly easy to get her to leave you behind: 'You don't get my money unless you go shopping by yourself'.  Believe it or not, most girls aren't gold diggers.  They probably just want to spend time with you, but need to run some errands at the same time.   'What's not fun is never having a day I where I can set my own schedule...'     What? Are these theoretical girls trying to get you to go shopping on a daily basis?  You do something that only they enjoy every once in a while, and in return, they do stuff that only you enjoy every once in a while.  If you don't have time for the occasional shopping trip with your girl, then you really don't have time for a serious relationship to begin with. That's called maturity/a healthy relationship/compromise.   'My deal is that if I can't reach sort of a rhythm with a female where she's respectful of my wants/needs & finds them reasonable then I'm out. I'm too old to make a big scene.

Ex's and there's a reason they're called that... and to be clear it's not being asked to go shopping. You can ask to put a bowling pin up my ass, asking is cool. It's throwing a tantrum and fucking shit up if I don't pony up with the time and cash on command.   most girls aren't gold diggers   Women are drawn to men who are good ""providers"" due to biological imperatives in our species. A better provider means she can raise a greater number of healthy offspring so as a means of keeping our species around women have gravitated towards dating the best possible provider. Even women who have decided not to have offspring have to deal with these biological drivers. So how do women know who the best providers are? Money... in the modern world it's all quantified by money.   It is my personal belief that most women are not gold diggers... all women are gold diggers... and it's not their fault, they come from the factory this way. I don't hate them for it, I just accept the order natural order of things.   I'm a guy and we tend to like young slender women with big bosoms... why? Young slender women with big bosoms produce the healthiest offspring and are best suited to care for them. Now I know that old fat women love me, I know that a lot of them are going to be kinder to me, I know that getting them will be much easier, therefore if I really like sex I should decide to like older fat women... thing is I can't, at the end of the day we're pre-programed to a certain extent. Between hormones and instincts both men and women are saddled with certain burdens.  So I will always like young nubile women and women will always like rich guys... it's just the facts of life."
malelifestyle,319a72,Dr_Bishop,1 point,Fri Apr 3 21:29:25 2015 UTC,"Our brain has evolved well past the point of falling back to biological imperatives for survival.  What we like in both women and men is hugely culturally based.  Some societies prefer very slender women, despite wider hips indicating better birthing, and anything but the absolute smallest of breasts are going to be fine for having kids, so our desire for that doesn't really have much to do with survival of the species.  There are plenty of women out there not looking for a financial provider, and plenty of men that are only looking for women that can and do provide for themselves."

I don't have to show you a society that vastly prefers the poor to prove that wrong.  I merely need to show one woman that doesn't care about a man that can provide for her.

That way you're taking a load off her hands, having fun yourself and giving her license to spend as much time frolicking amongst the fashions as she chooses without you being subjected to the drudgery of being dragged through a mall.   On a related note, I'm seeing guys here saying ""grow a backbone"".  This is great advice if you truly don't give a shit and will give any excuse to avoid making a sacrifice for someone you are supposed to care about.   It's terrible advice if you actually want to make a relationship work. Either man up and make the trip without complaining or come up with a constructive way of building your relationship in a way that avoids the mall trip (as suggested above) ."

You can't outrun too many calories.  Whatever it is do two things.    1: Cook your own food instead of eating out so much.  Make it healthy and have her help cook and you model portion control..  2: Include her in your vigorous activities.  Have her hike/bike/lift with you.  For me personally, lifting is my me time and i DON'T want company.  But taking a long walk together etc is nice."
malelifestyle,30q9wt,lucubratious,2,Mon Mar 30 01:21:01 2015 UTC,"Exactly. A caloric deficit is the ONLY way to lose weight. Basic law of conservation of mass; you need to have more output in terms of your BMR and activity than input to shed the fat. Simple. The hard part is realizing that it is an entire lifestyle change - change your eating habits, but it has to be a permanent healthy lifestyle change, because you're just going to put it back on when you go back to eating shit.  Best first step is just to cook your own food like lucubratious said. You can count your calories and avoid snacking, just stay in a caloric deficit, which will make you lose weight. Exercise is there to assist a bit in the burning of calories (though it is not the majority factor), GAINZ, and keeping your health in check."

The thing is I'm trying to watch what I eat it's not really the healthiest and I don't want to get fat.   Boom, you just her to consider does the stuff I shovel into my face contribute to my weight problem.  Some people are saying just be honest and come out with the ""I used to think you were hotter"" or ""you'd be hotter if"" type stuff... man women will never forget or forgive that completely. That'll be a lifelong black mark on your relationship if you continue to have one.   There's a lot to be said about subtly when dealing with females. You cook them a healthy meal and keep taking them on daily runs they can only bitch so loud to their gf's. Conversely if you tell them you think they're getting fat, man every chick they know is going to curse your name and tell her how she deserves better, should go fuck other guys, etc.   You're like a blind man in a minefield... be careful."

Additionally, how many elegant fashion options are there for men which aren't derived from labour designs like lace up boots? Not many. While womens wear runs the gamut of frilly and free to knee high-high bondage on any given Monday, mens wear is mostly confined in a bootstrap, action-ready fantasy; although drab and clunky is awesomely masculine, I don't need to wear 19th century work boots or hot, stiff Italian leather heals to the office, to the store, on a date. So thank goodness for loafers! Is this article propaganda for the season's loafer manufacturing? No more than it has been since the 1950s.

malelifestyle,30el9h,Jack41096,2,Thu Mar 26 21:51:46 2015 UTC,I personally bought a roll for $40 on sale. What really adds up are the tools needed in leatherwork that probably cost >$150. So this is still a relatively cheaper hobby in comparison to say tennis where a racquet would cost ths same.

malelifestyle,305h16,TheJeff,2,Wed Mar 25 10:08:35 2015 UTC,Yes to everything but the method of prep. A Manhattan should be a stirred cocktail. Shaking adds ice shards and bubbles that ruins the texture. Stirring gives a velvety smooth finish and it looks cool in the glass then.
malelifestyle,305h16,spliff231,2,Wed Mar 25 12:39:55 2015 UTC,Traditionally it is made with Rye.  No Manhattaner would be caught drinking bourbon

Never really messed with it in its pure form other than cocktails such as an Old Fashioned.  Tennessee: this is where your sodas come in as it's a sweeter alcohol and they play well together. Think Jack & Coke, 7&7, etc.   Canadian: plays by similar rules as it's Tennessee cousin.   Irish: neat, straight, rocks are all good here.

You actually NEED to be this wealthy to live out of a Westy at 21 these days. Romanticizing the idea of permanent van camping has made it unreachable for average people. When I was in high school my friends and I had Westfalia vans, and spent every weekend camped out, and every summer driving from state-to-state on a new adventure. A high school/college aged kid couldn't touch a Westfalia with both his parents 401k's combined these days, and it's because everyone seems to think it is so damn cool. It's great that this guy is representing the Westy  and all, but we really don't need the extra attention.  EDIT: In case you don't know what I'm talking about GoWesty is one of the companies that has drastically affected the price of old Volkswagen campers. Sportsmobile is another van company that buys up every van they can get their hands on for retrofitting. These are the big names in the game.   I seem to have hurt some feelings by expressing my opinion here, so I apologize to the 3 people who disagree with me for having a different opinion than you. Thanks for taking the time to discuss it with me instead of just downvoting the comment silently."
malelifestyle,2zppri,Vroonkle,4,Sat Mar 21 09:14:46 2015 UTC,"I DID read it. The ""top of the line brand new vehicles"" aren't the desirable ones. People want the old ones. There are companies that refurbish the old ones, and sell them for around 60-120k dollars. They have started improving the new ones for sale as well, but the problem is what they've done to the old ones. That fat chick Westy he has is one of the least desirable models of the Westfalia, but it cost him 10,000 bucks! Those things could be had for 500-1000 bucks just 10 years ago."

malelifestyle,2z2pr2,Major_Tom42,-1,Sun Mar 15 18:48:13 2015 UTC,"Easy ways to dress well:  1) For very casual: jeans with matching jeans/denim jacket. Casual, but excellent and works with any kind of shirt or t-shirt. Probably better dress jeans / dark denim than stonewashed and make the pants a hue or two darker as you are going to wash them more.    not bad but his shit ain't even matching, bad   matching, just too stonewashed    this vest would be also cool if the color was matching   don't listen to these idiots, Matt Damon would look all OK if the size was matching and it was not so stonewashed  Remember, suits are elegant because top and pants are matching. Imitate the same thing in denim and you are good looking casual.  2) For less casual: dress jeans, black leather jacket, black or blue polo shirt (t-shirt with collar), black belt and shoes.   3) One level up: replacing the leather jacket with a dark grey dressier jacket. Not actually black, just  close to black: actual black looks like waiter, pianist etc. staff member in the restaurant, no good.  4) Topping it out: dark grey, almost black suit (again black = waiter or orchestra conductor stuff), any light hue shirt and the same color darker as tie. No patterns.  Source: 37, like to look good, but hate to invest time into it. I researched the low hanging fruits. They are these."

malelifestyle,2z2put,BiscuitDance,3,Sun Mar 15 16:48:18 2015 UTC,"Yes, they make lots of good beers.  There is always going to be a brewery somewhere that makes a bolder version of any beer that Sam Adams makes, but they are extremely prolific in the types of beer they brew, and they are all rock solid.  The original Boston Lager is completely uninspiring, but its not trying to fancy-up the lager, its just a plain lager done as well as it can be done.  If you ask the question ""What does beer taste like?"", I would posit Boston Lager as the answer.  To me its like the universal baseline of ""beer flavor"", and my go-to choice for an alternative to drinking mass market light beer."

Pure boxers may not have to worry about it as much and the question in that article is in regard to why lifting won't make you punch harder.   Which may be true.  But it doesn't answer the question, will being stronger make you betterr in say...the clinch? Which is more relevant to MMA and even Muay Thai and all the other sports I listed."
malelifestyle,2z2r0k,alchemisthemo,1 point,Wed Mar 18 11:43:02 2015 UTC,"I really like the article's breakdown of punching mechanics, one of the best I've seen; however, I don't think that its arguments on weightlifting are accurate.  His overall argument seems to be that power punching requires correct technique and therefore weightlifting isn't useful since it does not develop punching technique.  However, that is a false dichotomy.  Weightlifting develops your strength, boxing develops the ability to use your strength.  If you only box your results are going to be suboptimal since the amount of strength you have to use is limited.  If you only lift weights then your results are going to be suboptimal since your ability to use your strength is limited.  In addition he seems to be focused exclusively on powerlifting as opposed to something like olympic lifting or kettlebells that have significant focus on power.  Finally, even if boxing itself didn't benefit from weightlifting, fighting does since you also need to be able to do things like throw and grapple."

malelifestyle,2ydlv7,ericfg,3,Mon Mar 9 00:39:10 2015 UTC,"One was a Seiko automatic on a completely unusable brown leather band.  I had that same model; everything I wanted in a work watch except for that POS 7S26 movement.  It worked great for a year and then lost minutes per day.  The repair was more than the watch was worth.  I get the allure of automatic watches but if you own more than two watches (Swiss) quartz is the only way to go. IMHO.  For me a good work watch (I'm in a commercial kitchen so the watch gets mega-abuse) is:  200m  rotating bezel with minutes (for cook times)  Butterfly or deployant clasps (for easy removal when getting dirty)  Day and date (to mark food)  Face and chapter ring with actual numbers so I don't have to stop and think what """" means"

I view beer as a joy that I give myself without the guilt of calories. I stick to a pretty strict diet, counting calories, eating right, working out, but if I'm going to drink beer, I just decide eff it and drink what I want. BUT, if you want to count your beer calories and stick to a strict diet, saving oneself 300 or more calories a sixer does make a difference."
malelifestyle,2xsus3,6-8_Yes_Size15,3,Tue Mar 3 16:52:22 2015 UTC,"Ah, true. Was looking at it more from the perspective of a single beer, or even three. But yes, if you're drinking a six pack in a single sitting it can start to add up."
malelifestyle,2xsus3,6-8_Yes_Size15,3,Tue Mar 3 17:08:24 2015 UTC,"Yeah, and if I'm drinking A LOT, it's usually something like a cheaper lager so it can really add up fast.   But then again, I still believe if you're going out (or staying in) to get snockered, you might as well give yourself a cheat day and drink whatever you want. One night of imbibing to the extreme is not going to ruin any diet."
malelifestyle,2xsus3,kayessaych,1 point,Tue Mar 3 17:24:35 2015 UTC,"But you still could be getting the same alcohol content (or more), fuller flavors, more variety, similar prices because you need less, same or more drunkness, and way less bloating in my opinion.  Unless you really just know that light is right for you.  Thats ok too!  I personally enjoy getting a 5-10$, 750ml bottle of delicious ass beer and I'm set for an evening since one of those gets me nice and toasty.  I could get toasty on bud light or pbr but I'd feel all gassy and it would still cost the price of 3-5 beers.    I will admit it is probably still more expensive but I don't think by much.  Plus if we're talking cans it can get a lot closer to price."
malelifestyle,2xsus3,cullen9,1 point,Wed Mar 4 15:39:26 2015 UTC,but the light beers and low cal beers also have a smaller alcohol percentage. So you'd have to buy twice the amount of bud select 55 for the same effect of a traditional Budweiser.

A 25 year old does not  worry much about needing a liver transplant at 50 but about getting fat yes, of course, why not?  I don't understand your reasoning here... you apparently think people with drinking problems are in some very deep pit where nothing else matters. It is not so, or perhaps it may be so for AA-type ""alcoholics"" who get blackout drunk every day. Unfortunately the AA-cult spreads the misinformation that every person is either normal or like that. In reality there are really many people who never get drunk but regularly get ""elevated"" every day as a way to cope with life.

People did not really intend to live beyond 60.  I don't really understand what is your objection to my vocabulary: addictions are obviously problems, why wouldn't they be? However alcoholism is a misused term, it indicates people who cannot stop before blackout drunk. However, it is perfectly possible, and way more common, to be addicted to alcohol yet not get too drunk - just too often."

malelifestyle,2xsus3,earthwormjim91,3,Wed Mar 4 04:17:13 2015 UTC,"Carbs (sugar and whatnot) are YUM yet bad for you only because we eat so much of it.   Our ancestors only came across fruit and other natural sweets (and other carbs e.g. wheat, potato, and maize) rarely since they're only ripe and in season a few times a year.   So when we did find precious sweets (apples etc) our bodies would reward us via our taste buds and feel-good homones, and kick up the insulin so we could quickly convert them into fat and hold on to it.  Fast forward to now where sugar is plentiful yet we intake so much of it, our bodies still hold on to simple sugars and convert them to fat as if it were still rare. Our bodies release so much insulin that we grow resistant and now have a t2 diabetes epidemic.  Contrast this (glycolysis - energy from blood glucose) to ketosis ( energy from fat). Our ancestors probably got most of their energy from fat via fishing and hunting, which is why our bodies seem uncomfortable with excessive carbohydrate intake.  tl;dr: everything in moderation"

malelifestyle,2xsus3,earthwormjim91,1 point,Wed Mar 4 05:04:30 2015 UTC,"Ketosis:       Ketosis /kɨˈtoʊsɨs/ is a metabolic state where most of the body's energy supply comes from ketone bodies in the blood, in contrast to a state of glycolysis where blood glucose provides most of the energy. It is characterised by serum concentrations of ketone bodies over 0.5 millimolar with low and stable levels of insulin and blood glucose.   It is almost always generalized with hyperketonemia, that is, an elevated level of ketone bodies in the blood throughout the body. Ketone bodies are formed by ketogenesis when liver glycogen stores are depleted (or from metabolising medium-chain triglycerides ). The main ketone bodies used for energy are acetoacetate and β-hydroxybutyrate,  and the levels of ketone bodies are regulated mainly by insulin and glucagon.  Most cells in the body can use both glucose and ketone bodies for fuel, and during ketosis free fatty acids and glucose synthesis (gluconeogenesis) fuel the remainder.

malelifestyle,2xsus3,mmurph,7,Wed Mar 4 04:32:06 2015 UTC,"Except, 50 calories is not a small amount if you're trying to lose weight. On a cut you may only get 1600 kcal/day, so every calorie counts. And that's just switching between commercial brews like Coors --> Coors Lite.  I drink Miller 64, and the difference between that and, say, Shiner, is more than 80 calories. If I have two beers, I'm saving 160 calories which can otherwise be spent on protein or vegetables.  Calorie counting is all about making small, disciplined changes to your diet to achieve your fitness goals over the long term. No one builds a new body or tears down an old one in a day."

If I'm sitting around with friends drinking 4+ beers its going to add up quick. 4x Miller 64 = 256 Calories. 4x Sam Adams Boston Larger = 680 Calories.

If the Budweiser 55 or Miller 64 is your go-to light beer then you can have 3 beers for the ""calorie cost"" of one fat tire. I'd pick a fat tire over a bud 55 7 days a week. That said, if I'm drinking en masse with the end-goal of achieving a solid buzz then I'm going for a 55. You save a lot when you're consuming 4-6 beers in one sitting. Just my 2 cents."
