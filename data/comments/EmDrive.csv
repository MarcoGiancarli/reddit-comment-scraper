Don't do the meep run on Windows.  You'll be stuck with the overhead of a Linux VM plus your native OS and it'll run like molasses. Don't do the meep run on a laptop, especially a Macbook (or an iMac, which is basically a stationary laptop).  Maxing out your CPU for over an hour straight will cause physical damage on a lot of modern laptops. Debian 8 with a hand-compiled meep 1.3 is my recommended platform for doing meep runs due to stability and ease of setup.  Instructions are in the thread.   I'm personally working on proper version-control infrastructure for keeping track of the input and output files.  Don't rush out to put everything on a Google Drive just yet. My machine is quite likely a lot faster than yours (dual socket Nehalem Xeon, sixteen threads total), so unless you've got a dual socket Ivy Bridge Xeon E7 or better, there won't be a whole lot of improvement over the CPU time we've already got."

EmDrive,3dzhkq,tidux,3,Tue Jul 21 03:16:03 2015 UTC,CPU only? I'm no expert but I believe for this kind of work GPU based computing would shorten calculation time by quite a bit.  I did some searches and it seems MEEP does not support GPU based compute. An OpenCL 2.0 implementation and a double precision card would do wonders!
EmDrive,3dzhkq,ElementII5,2,Tue Jul 21 08:03:39 2015 UTC,We've already got an expert on the forums looking into a GPU implementation.  Unfortunately based on his card-naming schemes he might be leaning towards CUDA.  If it comes up again I'll see if I can nudge him towards OpenCL so AMD users can play too.

EmDrive,3e03oa,BlaineMiller,5,Mon Jul 20 22:45:08 2015 UTC,"That's just how science works. It can often explain what, it can sometimes explain why. We have very little understanding of the why for something like gravity, but a pretty good understanding of the effects of gravity(the what).   So if it does work, and this is a rather big if, and we don't know why, it really doesn't say much about it other than it's using/interacting with unknown physics. There are a great many things that science has observed but does not know why it works that way.   It would simply spur physicists to come up with hypotheses connecting the drive mechanics to our current understanding of the physical universe."
EmDrive,3e03oa,Deeviant,3,Tue Jul 21 21:46:20 2015 UTC,It reminds me a bit of the discovery of electromagnetism - a researcher noticed a compass needle being deflected when he passed electricity through a wire and deduced that there must be a connection though he didn't know how at the time. The observation led to some incredible discoveries and inventions.
EmDrive,3e03oa,Fallcious,5,Tue Jul 21 11:02:59 2015 UTC,"It's entirely possible. A lot of discoveries are made this way. You do experiments for one thing and get some completely different results. All it means is that we'll never understand everything, seeing how discoveries are still being made.  Besides, I'm pretty sure stuff like gravity and inertia is beyond human comprehension, and we use those regularly."
EmDrive,3e03oa,Ree81,6,Tue Jul 21 00:31:05 2015 UTC,"I like to think that nothing is really beyond comprehension, just because we don't understand something doesn't mean its impossible for us to ever understand it. We're a pretty clever species."

I know it can and will make me fall on my face.   Data we so dearly need data, no not the Data from STNG but configuration data, test data to fully wrap this thing called an abnormality in an envelope to decipher what and why it's doing what it's doing. Right now (myself as well) and everyone is trying to plug little bits and pieces of sometimes conflicting data to come up with a viable idea as to just what is it doing? Unless someone hits the jackpot with a solid and verifiable idea they still are going to need solid data from real drives in a real world. Einstein came up with one of the most beautiful formulas the word has known and we are still verifying it after a hundred years.  The beauty is we can test this and we can build this Frustum and get data and that's the way it works sometimes to figure out the why. Because with the data we don't need to entirely need to know how it works we still can fine tune the effect. We'll figure out the why later."

EmDrive,3e03oa,SnowDog2003,0,Wed Jul 22 12:27:34 2015 UTC,"Shawyer didn't develop it from established theory. There is nothing in established theory that suggests that the EmDrive should work. Shawyer has some math that he claims explains the anomalous thrust given known physics, but it is faulty.   If the EmDrive results so far can not be explained by experimental error, then their explanation will likely require new physics (e.g. MiHsC)."

The precautions are two fold. First little old me. And second to make sure nothing from the outside influences the test data. It's in the Rockies above 8000 ft mainly decomposed granite around and pine trees. Steel framed and steel walls on the area I'm in 24x14 ft somewhat isolated from the rest.

EmDrive,3dvcbd,Monomorphic,6,Sun Jul 19 22:18:51 2015 UTC,"Thanks!  Sure, I'll be happy to tell you.  The power is in a protected area under the center of the Fulcrum beam in a faraday cage. The control (heater filament and power coax leads) are fed into a liquid conductor in several small containers beside the beam. This virtually friction free movement of the wires in the cup allows me to not worry about running solid wires causing movement stress on the beam. The wires control and power are shielded coax and run from the cups down the 1 meter of carbon fiber tube through a slot in the mesh of the faraday cage (100x 25 mm) then dropping down to attach to the EMDrive.  The drive is made from a Perforated Copper sheet, that to the microwaves looks like a solid, but the holes allow for heat to escape negating the heated air balloon effect. Plus I plan to video the cavity under full power, like what you can see in your microwave door, should be interesting.  Drive orientation can be reversed 180 degrees."

EmDrive,3dtkq2,Zouden,3,Sun Jul 19 09:26:01 2015 UTC,A concave base? I think it's a very good idea. Many microwave cavities have concave bases to improve Q.
EmDrive,3dtkq2,See-Shell,3,Sun Jul 19 09:30:02 2015 UTC,"Several have thought about this very thing and it's a good idea worth testing. It has some drawbacks with smaller Qs. Q is such a relative figure anyway and we are looking for the EM waves to do real work.   If you look at my design, it shrinks down to a 1 inch opening. Smaller endplates to be inserted for different modes further down the cavity length. Yes, it's worth getting data on."

But then I'd also have to point out that we have things like generators and motors and all sorts of equipment making use of magnets and magnetic fields. It isn't magical free energy, that's the point. To someone of the 14th century, modern technology would be literal magic, energy and work seemingly from nothing. But it isn't from nowhere and neither would the force extracted using the casmir effect be from nowhere, it would be drawn out of the ZPF imbalances. I think you can use MiHsC to solve the CofE violations you get with an accelerating reactionless drive, but I'm not sure if /u/memcculloch has specifically tested that.

EmDrive,3dsh7d,CryptoMonger,-5,Mon Jul 20 02:49:52 2015 UTC,Actually there is already a very good explanation for dark matter. According to Dr. Randell Mills dark matter is nothing more than hydrogen where the electron has fallen below the so called Bohr radius and doesn't interact in a manner that is easily detectable. It is not something we normally encounter because once created it's quickly ejected into space. However it has been captured and studied with very sophisticated equipment by third parties apart from Dr. Mills and his lab. He also has had outsiders observe soft X-Rays being given off by the process that he discovered which converts normal hydrogen into dark matter(hydrinos). There is no currently accepted theory that can explains these observations.
EmDrive,3dsh7d,YugoReventlov,5,Sun Jul 19 06:44:00 2015 UTC,"According to wikipedia:   Critics say it lacks corroborating scientific evidence, and is a relic of cold fusion. Critical analysis of the claims have been published in the peer reviewed journals Physics Letters A,New Journal of Physics, Journal of Applied Physics, and Journal of Physics D: Applied Physics. These works note that the proposed theory is inconsistent with quantum mechanics, and that the proposed hydrino states are unphysical and incompatible with key equations that have been experimentally verified many times.   And    The BLP process,[35] discovered by Randy Mills, is said to coax hydrogen atoms into a ""state below the ground state"", called the ""hydrino."" There is no independent scientific confirmation of the hydrino, and BLP has a patent problem. So they have nothing to sell but bull shit. The company is therefore dependent on investors with deep pockets and shallow brains."""
EmDrive,3dsh7d,CryptoMonger,-4,Sun Jul 19 07:16:42 2015 UTC,"Why don't you tell that to the people and labs who have verified his work because they will tell you otherwise.

EmDrive,3dsa94,PaulTheSwag,8,Sat Jul 18 23:42:52 2015 UTC,"If you have some spare copper, try it with an actual cone instead of one that's truncated. MiHsC seems to indicate that a more 'pointed' cone will increase thrust, though the equations go a bit off the rails with a 'perfect' point because you start hitting divide by zero instances. I don't think that's liable to be an issue because its not really possible to have a mathmatically 'perfect' cone in reality, it will have a truncated end even if the truncation is on the micrometre scale.   Either that or some weird shit will start happening and the thing will launch itself through your roof."

I was planning on using the same Eagleworks dimensions from the spreadsheet that Iulian used because he got thrust at 2.45 GHz. I'm using an identical 2.45 GHz microwave oven magnetron so how would one go about calculating the frustum's size for that frequency? (sadly my maths is highschool level).
EmDrive,3dsa94,flux_capacitor78,0,Sun Jul 19 20:07:59 2015 UTC,"Ask /u/TheTravellerEMD He has an Excel spreadsheet and will confirm if your design can achieve resonance at 2.45GHz.

EmDrive,3dsa94,flux_capacitor78,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:00:10 2015 UTC,"What are your frustum dimensions (small base diameter, big base diameter, length)?  How did you compute resonance and thus dimensions from the source you'll be using?"

EmDrive,3dsa94,flux_capacitor78,2,Sun Jul 19 15:53:57 2015 UTC,"That's a problem, then. Iulian Berca used Eagleworks's frustum dimensions, which was tuned to operate with a solid-state RF amp @ 1932.6 MHz. Yet Iulian used a 2.45 GHz oven magnetron and never used a VNA (Vector Network Analyzer) with S11 and S21 plots to check if resonance was achieved.   I'm sorry but one can't made a frustum at any dimensions and cone angle and then use any microwave source to power it. You need to theoretically compute the dimensions before. For example, ask /u/TheTravellerEMD for his spreadsheet."
EmDrive,3dsa94,Zouden,3,Sun Jul 19 16:39:41 2015 UTC,That's interesting. Iulian's frustum appeared to generate force anyway.
EmDrive,3dsa94,TortugaTerritory,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:06:38 2015 UTC,The evidence gets weaker and weaker every day.
EmDrive,3dsa94,Zouden,2,Sun Jul 19 17:38:24 2015 UTC,"How do you mean? Iulian's experiment was pretty basic but the frustrum clearly became ""lighter"" when it was pointed upright, and ""heavier"" when it was pointed down. It's not immediately obvious to me how such a device can get heavier.  From what /u/flux_capacitor78 said, it sounds like Iulian would have observed a stronger effect if his frustrum was better tuned."
EmDrive,3dsa94,flux_capacitor78,0,Sun Jul 19 17:50:04 2015 UTC,"Because Iulian Berca brute-forced the cavity with 1.2 kW of power. Usually when you push someone sat on a swing, you choose to gradually impart momentum to the person at the perfectly right moment to increase the swing, depending on the current amplitude of the swing. You do not push your arms when the swing is at the opposite. You naturally fit yourself on a resonant basis.   EmDrive needs resonance. Iulian Berca has some merit, especially since he was the first DIYer to show a replication, and because his frustum was quickly and well built from an engineer point of view. But the experiment itself, with absolutely no control over what was going on inside the cavity, was poorly executed from a scientific point of view. I hope other DIYers will do a better job regarding controls.  EDIT: I am not completely sure about the non-resonant part of Iulian's cavity. Eagleworks used a dielectric inside their cavity, which changed the resonant frequency. Iulian didn't use any dielectric, so maybe he achieved some resonance at 2.45GHz. If someone can confirm or deny this fact, comments welcomed."
EmDrive,3dsmgt,occams_laser_pewpew,2,Sun Jul 19 01:45:27 2015 UTC,"If I understand correctly, AESA systems specifically wouldn't be all that useful, because for the most part they use longer frequency, lower energy, radio waves instead of microwaves. If I'm reading the theories behind the thrust generation correctly, cavity size needs to scale closely with wavelength. A higher frequency wave requires a smaller cavity to be useful, and a lower frequency wave needs a larger cavity. I'm not sure on the scaling exactly, but it quickly becomes impractical to make a cavity of the appropriate dimensions once you get out of the microwave range. I might be wrong about that, needs more testing."
EmDrive,3dsmgt,Sagebrysh,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:00:21 2015 UTC,Just a quick google suggests that millimeter-wave AESA systems are in development (if Raytheon's bragging is to be believed). It doesn't look like minimum wavelength would be a showstopper in the long run.
EmDrive,3dsmgt,kawfey,2,Sun Jul 19 02:22:28 2015 UTC,"The point of AESA is to use less power and more computational wizardry to locate and track targets, so by that regard it doesn't apply to emdrive, but also the fact that its a purpose built antenna array...idk man, bottom line is it's apples to oranges."

However, AESA are exactly what they sound like. Active Electronically Scanned Arrays. They are used for producing scannable (steerable) beams. They also use active elements for power amplification.  They are completely different from cavity magnetrons. EmDrive uses a resonant cavity as far as I understand. This is by no means an old-school technology, just a fundamental physical concept."

EmDrive,3dp45e,Zouden,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:19:40 2015 UTC,i think heat raidiation comes from unusable energy.  Energy that is transformed into force would not bleed off heat.  So in my thinking a 100% efficient EMdrive would radiate zero heat.  Conversely the more heat you produce that is unused energy and would proportianately lower your overall thrust.
EmDrive,3dp45e,Sledgecrushr,5,Sat Jul 18 16:28:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah exactly, so a first generation emdrive would probably melt before it's able to levitate. We'd need a much higher N/W ratio before we start attaching them to nuclear reactors.  As an aside, what does 100% efficiency mean? Newtons and watts can't be reconciled."
EmDrive,3dp45e,Zouden,2,Sat Jul 18 16:41:03 2015 UTC,"It would radiate heat.  That's an engineering challenge, to reduce heat loss to a minimum (and recover what you can etc.). Any space-going vessel would obviously need radiators...quite likely built into wings to aid atmospheric flight...  But this is the direction.  Working Fusion reactors + working EM drives = unlimited travel. Well, basically unlimited.  Deuterium is a very efficient fuel source.    Energy was always the problem with the flying car, and the SSTO spaceplane alike - where do you get the power from? We can built VTOL engines that would allows everyone to be all DeLorean'in it up, no problem.  And the spaceplane rocket engine problem seems to be getting solved fairly well.  But the energy was always the problem - storing enough fuel onboard your flying car, or spaceplane, to get it where you wanted.  A small, portable fusion reactor, and a propellentless EM drive...that answers all that.    And even if Shawyer's bit about not being able to use EM for acceleration is correct, you can still use the fusion reactor for heat-air turbine in-atmosphere... So want all this to be true, and here NOW...not 25 years time..."
EmDrive,3dp45e,raresaturn,3,Sat Jul 18 19:52:48 2015 UTC,I'm actually more optimistic than you because I think the EmDrive (if it works) can be used to harness energy from the zero point field. So we can power EmDrive ships with EmDrive turbines. No need for fusion power!
EmDrive,3dp45e,Taven,4,Sat Jul 18 20:37:22 2015 UTC,100% efficiency to me would be zero waste heat.  All of the power would be converted directly to force.

As a young person, learning what has been developed and discovered over hundreds of years is most often the best thing, because you can be more sure that those things are right. It should have the highest status for someone who has no experience himself, and someone who has no factual reason to challenge the models.

I'm also on the ""fringes"" of science, since I'm an advocate for open access publishing, open data sharing, and other approaches to greater reproducibility.  Most scientists are absolutely in favor of all of those things, but they work under tremendous career and funding pressure. The only thing that counts for getting or keeping a job are grants and papers. Grants are needed to make good papers, and since funding is so tight for grants, most granting agencies only fund the proposals highly likely to give some results. EmDrives, which likely require new physics have a very remote chance of actually working, so they will have virtually no chance of getting mainstream grant money.   That and most scientists spend most of their time not doing science. Most work in universities with uniform ""publish or perish"" expectations, they have heaps of administrative crap (bureaucratic work), and face 90% rejection rates for granting programs (where each grant application can consume a month or more to compose). Very few researchers ever get tenure (most end up as PostDocs which are just contract workers), and those that do get tenure see most of their time consumed by all of the above.  It's our society's infatuation with bureaucratizing everything (which is what performance metrics are all about) and making science so brutally competitive that stifles creativity.   You put this all together with the fact that most new ideas in physics are likely wrong (which is still the case for the EmDrive), then you can see why most professionals are very reluctant to engage in fringe areas.

EmDrive,3dozoo,PsychoBoyJack,6,Sat Jul 18 01:54:59 2015 UTC,"Ok, this may go a bit beyond ELI5, but in the end it may give you a clearer idea.  Suppose a spaceship. Inside, braced against the wall close to the engines, there's an astronaut with a shotgun. He starts shooting against the far wall, the one that separates the mad astronaut from the cockpit.  Now count the number of pellets that hit the wall and calculate the wall's area and how much time the astronaut needed to empty his gun. That would give you a number which would read “pellets divided by time and area”  If we know the amunt of energy that an individual pellet carry, you get “energy divided by time and area”. Since energy divided by time is power, you actually measured power per unit of area.  That, applied to electromagnetic waves, is the Poynting vector.  Why is it relevant to EmDrives  Energy for em waves is related to force. If you get the Poynting vector, in the end you can calculate backwards force from areas and pressure.  So, if the calculations show that there is a Poynting vector, does this mean the EmDrive works?  Not exactly. Going back to the astronaut example, imagine him throwing a super bouncy ball that goes back and forth from one wall to another. If you calculate the analog to the Poynting vector for that ball, you'd get that while it maintains it's module -how big it its, it's numerical magnitude or however you want to understand it- it changes direction every time it bounces. An observer outside the ship would see it shaking, but not moving on average.  Why the big hoopla about it then?  A guy proved some time back using math that a cavity shaped a lot like an EmDrive would have an average Poynting vector of zero. The recent simulations done in the NSF thread shows that it doesn't. However, there's a problem: it appears to not be stable in time. This means either:  A) It's not a steady state. It means that we're measuring the spaceship's position just after the astronaut throws the ball, but before it bounces the first time, we see the spaceship moving backwards and claim “Eureka!”  To reach a steady state, apparently the program would have to be running for 40-some days on an average computer, so there's a lot more computation to be done.  B) It's unstable with time and ever growing, which means the model is for some reason not valid and the whole effort is much probably, worthless.  Is the whole thing worth doing?  Depends on who you ask. She-shells would say that she's a girl, there are things in the universe, quantum ball, uncertainty cats and evanescent waves carrying relativity atoms that we don't know and also, that she's a girl. Rodal would say that a model of what happens inside it will help when we have data from experiments. TheTraveller would say it doesn't matter because Shawyer (pbuh) had all figured out in 2002."

After a long discussion on NFS this afternoon about poynting vectors and stress calculations with pictures and diagrams and chicken scratching formulas I said this. It boils down to nothing simpler than this. Yep I'm a girl and like cats, especially Schrodinger's. I have a pressure tank for air and it looks like a Frustum cavity, big end little end. I fill it up with pressure then put a speaker in the end and blast away with the 1812 Overture towards one end that's high with the differential pressure from the speaker. The cannons set off and pressure differential inside of the tank becomes more asymmetrical with more energy and pressure accumulated at one end. Ka boom! The cannons set off. The tank sits, unmoving.  What this number crunching is pointing to is to be able to quantify the internal forces of the waves in a EMDrive and how they amplify by bouncing back and forth, it becomes a good deal of energy adding more each bounce. How much, where and when does it focus that accumulated effect and can that amplified and stored energy be enough to cause the Drive to influence the creation of E/P pairs or ripping up the quantum Vacuum to make virtual particles and expelling them through the cavity walls. Evanescent waves penetrating (tunneling) the boundary walls imparting thrust in interaction with air outside. Or RS's theories. There are about a dozen theories.

EmDrive,3dmr9e,Eric1600,3,Fri Jul 17 22:34:22 2015 UTC,"Evanescent waves sometimes have solutions that are not apparent in Maxwells equations.  To solve Maxwell's equations boundary conditions must be imposed on the structure.  This means that at the boundary all solutions must converge with nothing extra left over.  In the case of an evanescent wave there is sometimes something non-linear that does not meet the given boundary conditions and is not predicted explicitly by Maxwell's equations.  However, and this is a big point, an evanescent wave is modeled as a completely reactive wave.  This is a wave that can not do any real work.  It is basically a temporary storage of energy that will get expended or decay in a standard way.  And this is sort of the definition.  A wave such as this one that decays in a direction for which the power flow is purely reactive is designated an evanescent wave.  It propagates no time average power because the electric and magnetic fields are 90 degrees out of phase everywhere and decay exponentially toward zero as it moves.  It you want to dig deep, here are some examples. http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-013-electromagnetics-and-applications-spring-2009/readings/MIT6_013S09_chap09.pdf"

The hunt has just intensified and there still needs to be tons of testing to see if this really is what we are seeing.

EmDrive,3dmr9e,Eric1600,3,Fri Jul 17 20:35:37 2015 UTC,"From that reference:   The complex angular reflection and transmission coefficients  Γ and T for TE waves approach those given by (9.1.19) and  (9.1.20) for normal incidence in the limit θi → 0.  The limit of grazing incidence is not so simple, and even the form of the transmitted wave can change markedly if it becomes evanescent.   They are not excluded or directly predicted by maxwell's equations.  This is a boundary problem which if you've done much work with Maxwell's equations you'll know that sometimes defining a perfect boundary condition is not possible.  This makes solving Maxwell's equations difficult.  Take the case of total internal reflected light https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evanescent_wave .   For example, consider total internal reflection in two dimensions, with the interface between the media lying on the x axis, the normal along y, and the polarization along z. One might naively expect that for angles leading to total internal reflection, the solution would consist of an incident wave and a reflected wave, with no transmitted wave at all, but there is no such solution that obeys Maxwell's equations. Maxwell's equations in a dielectric medium impose a boundary condition of continuity for the components of the fields E||, H||, Dy, and By. For the polarization considered in this example, the conditions on E|| and By are satisfied if the reflected wave has the same amplitude as the incident one, because these components of the incident and reflected waves superimpose destructively. Their Hx components, however, superimpose constructively, so there can be no solution without a non-vanishing transmitted wave. The transmitted wave cannot, however, be a sinusoidal wave, since it would then transport energy away from the boundary, but since the incident and reflected waves have equal energy, this would violate conservation of energy. We therefore conclude that the transmitted wave must be a non-vanishing solution to Maxwell's equations that is not a traveling wave, and the only such solutions in a dielectric are those that decay exponentially: evanescent waves.   In order for these waves to be compliant with Maxwell's field equations they have to be conservative, even if the boundary conditions can't be satisfied.  These type of waves decay fast and are considered a near-field effect.  As such they are highly non-linear and short lived."
EmDrive,3dmr9e,Mrseeksme,2,Sat Jul 18 04:58:57 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the explanations.  I didn't work a lot with Maxwell's equations, and I didn't study evanescent waves either. However, I am familiar with PDE solving in general.  I still don't fully understand it. There is no intermediate state: either evanescent waves are solutions to Maxwell's equations with some boundary conditions, or they aren't. It can be verified by substituting (9.2.30), (9.2.33), (9.2.34) (if I understood it correctly, they are the boundary condition and wave formulae) into Maxwell's equations. You will simply get the answer. See the same reference, p. 259 at the bottom:   The last step of the four-step method for solving boundary value problems involves checking this solution against all Maxwell’s equations — they are satisfied.   For me it's tedious to do this because I'll need to study it in all details, that's why I ask this question. I hope that someone already knows this. In the end everything you cited points to them being the solutions. From your quote:    We therefore conclude that the transmitted wave must be a non-vanishing solution to Maxwell's equations that is not a traveling wave, and the only such solutions in a dielectric are those that decay exponentially: evanescent waves."
EmDrive,3dmr9e,sorrge,3,Sat Jul 18 09:58:19 2015 UTC,"Boiled down they are consistent with Maxwell's equations because they are a reactive portion of the boundary conditions which are imaginary.  The hard part is you have to assume a solution with this imaginary portion of the wave, solve the equations, then rework them again to make sure the imaginary non-vanishing portion works.  In a typical solution you can also solve the same problem and exclude the imaginary portion and also have Maxwell's equations appear to be satisfied, however the imaginary transient bit of the evanescent wave will be missing.  Because they exist in the reactive state (or imaginary) they decay exponentially and don't exhibit absorption.  The not exhibiting absorption part is the problem I have with claims that the evanescent wave can be exchanging momentum, etc."

It would be more surprising if they could exchange this momentum to something outside the inertial frame of reference that the EM Drive is in.  However since we don't have any kind of model or experimental evidence to support that EM waves of any type can do this, it's doubtful that transient EM waves could do this either.  The evanescent wave sounds interesting, but really they are everywhere and have been since the dawn of time.  They are just part of the non-linear boundary conditions.  They decay fast and have no long term use due to their rapid decay can difficultly in maintaining and using them.  In optics there has been some novel uses for the non-linear part of EM propagation, but in general these type of waves are everywhere and nothing has been observed from them before even in ultra high power superconducting conditions like in particle accelerators."

Getting older I find it's hard for me to bend to accept new ideas but current research has unlocked details of forces that haven't been discovered before. A very good paper that shows that this old gal needs to bend some.  http://arxiv.org/abs/1308.0547 Discussion To summarize, we have found that a single evanescent electromagnetic wave offers a rich and highly non-trivial structure of the local momentum and spin distributions. In sharp contrast to standard photon properties, evanescent waves carry helicity-independent transverse spin and helicity-dependent transverse momentum. Moreover, the transverse momentum turns out to be a fundamental spin momentum introduced by Belinfante in field theory and first remarked in optics (as an unusual Poynting vector) by Fedorov. We have examined the measurements of the extraordinary spin and momentum in the evanescent field by analysing its interaction with a probe particle. Analytical evaluations and exact numerical simulations based on parameters of typical optical-manipulation experiments show that the transverse helicity-independent spin (and also the vertical electric spin for diagonal polarizations) can be detected straightforwardly via the radiation torque exerted on an absorbing small particle. At the same time, the Belinfante– Fedorov’s spin momentum does not exert the standard optical pressure in the dipole approximation, which confirms its ‘virtual’ character (in contrast to Fedorov’s interpretation). Nonetheless, it appears detectable (in contrast to the field-theory interpretation) via a helicitydependent transverse optical force from the higher-order non-weak interaction with Mie  particles. Thus, an exceptional evanescent-wave structure with pure spin transverse momentum offers a unique opportunity for the direct observation of this fundamental field-theory quantity, which was previously considered as ‘virtual’. These results add a distinct chapter in the physics of momentum and spin of classical and quantum fields, and offers a variety of non-trivial light-matter interaction effects involving evanescent fields."

I will say when someone starts to grab a model of a spaceship saying all kinds of things can be done I'm skeptical. I've never heard of planes being thrown a hundred miles from a thunderstorm like he has claimed.  I first want to get the physics of the EMDrive down, provide open and clear data then plug that data into the dozen or so theories to see what fits.   I have my own ideas that don't start off with warp drives or bending spacetime or even violating CoM or CoE or even Maxwell's equations. I want simple solid data that can be tested and verified step by step up from the noise level. If and I say if quantum effects or disturbing the ZPF or virtual particles or warping or UnRah radiation are happening we at least defined the EMDrive according to well established laws of physics and can make sure the next step is a solid one."
EmDrive,3dmr9e,Mrseeksme,5,Sat Jul 18 02:40:13 2015 UTC,"Why think it works? Why is nobody worried that the thrust  decreased significantly when the device was put into a vacuum.Why does the baby em test drive not have any thrust whatsoever beyond the  statistical error margin or even signal noise.  Doesn't it seem suspect that the thrust just so happens to always be just below the amount needed to actually rule out statistical error or other effects(at least in the drives made by amateurs).  Like that youtube guy that reported thrust  a few weeks ago,what happened to him?Where did he dissapear to?  Everybody got all excited but all I saw in those videos was electromagnetical interference with the digital scale used(this can explain that video).  In a way I kinda feel for you,I hope you don't get your hopes up too much and don't invest too much money in your project.I'm happy you are doing this but I have seen no reason whatsoever to assume this device does anything at all!(the poynting factor is the most ""convincing"" but exactly how would that lead to thrust like at all?? it's a complete non sequitur,exactly what are these resonant waves supposed to be 'pushing' against or how does this lead to thrust?)"

EmDrive,3dmr9e,TheTravellerEMD,2,Fri Jul 17 19:19:32 2015 UTC,"Because if it did work, it would be much easier to test in a vacuum (which they have access to) and it could ride on a cube-sat into space.

EmDrive,3dmr9e,dicroce,8,Fri Jul 17 19:28:38 2015 UTC,"Like I said on the NSF site, this thig isn't dead my any means. What I have is just a theory. We are invoking some very strange physics from this device and I don't think the fat lady has sung yet.   Two very strong points. One if this theory is correct than it can be ramped up IMHO to exceed a Ion thruster in a vacuum with the correct frequencies and selection of propellants that are not the Argon that the Ion uses.   2, There is thrust although diminished in a vacuum and don't seem to use propellants from the local area. This is another factor to seriously look into as to the why it still shows thrust and can be a real key to EMDrive propellantless propulsion.   I will not shy away from building my EMDrive as I honestly believe is can be the next step in propulsion, there is too much we don't know."
EmDrive,3dkeu3,Sagebrysh,10,Thu Jul 16 23:57:44 2015 UTC,"It has been attempted, but reproducibility seems to be very tricky.   All these types of experiments suffer from trying to find tiny cracks on the edges of the otherwise rock solid edifice of physics.  To have survived the last 150 odd years of scientific development and research effectively undetected, any new dynamic effects are typically going to involve either vanishingly small forces or highly specific or unusual arrangements of matter. Or both."
EmDrive,3dkeu3,daronjay,8,Fri Jul 17 02:06:38 2015 UTC,"Momentum, spin, force, acceleration, mass, magnetic, electric forces of light, light is even a particle and a wave that exhibits quantum effects (slit experiment) and spooky actions of entanglement with superluminal instantaneous actions across long distances, evanescent waves like a stripped down version of a wave that can impart first order forces and control the movement of small particles. All of these forces and actions are carried in a wave. I keep remembering Einstein's equation E=MC2 and remind myself that light (energy) is simply a form of the forces that make matter what it is. If there is a formula for controlling mass and acceleration and warping spacetime like matter does it is in the waves (energy) on the other side of the equation. Making all this work like it does is the Quantum Vacuum of space-time. The're about 12 theories out there and each has pluses and minuses understanding how the fundamental makeup of light (RF shoved into in the EMDrive) can be modified to give us an effect that takes us places with out thrust. We really are not violating anything but using what mother nature gave us in E=MC2.  So why is light and a photon massless? Hmm it's not, just read a paper on MIt doing a experiment with a Bose Condensate that photons were interacting with that exhibited a heavy mass effect.  Einstein's special relativity says E2=p2c2+m2c4 and if E=pc, then we're all okay (? Ha) with zero mass... nonvanishing energy and momentum... my head spins.  So we're working to find the Betty Crocker ingredients in a photon to rip and cajole out mass and momentum and finding the holes."

EmDrive,3diiqn,coolkcah,6,Thu Jul 16 17:33:19 2015 UTC,"/u/memcculloch  The EW laser interferometry test was on a cylindrical cavity. Hence, wouldn't the horizon for the Unruh waves be the same at both ends? I don't understand how MiHsC applies in this situation."
EmDrive,3diiqn,ImAClimateScientist,9,Thu Jul 16 23:08:09 2015 UTC,"If I can start with an explanation on a cosmic scale: MiHsC predicts there is a minimum acceleration in nature: this is because Unruh waves lengthen as accelerations decrease, and at the tiny acceleration of a=2c2 /(Hubble scale)~10-10 m/s2 they get as long as the Hubble scale and so cannot be seen in principle. As Mach said, if you can't see something in principle then it doesn't exist, so the Unruh waves start to dissappear at this tiny acceleration, the inertial mass decreases and the acceleration increases again.. This leads to a predicted acceleration minimum which is encouragingly close to the observed cosmic acceleration.  Now back to NASA's laser-through-cavity experiment, just as for the emdrive, the cavity wall is now like the Hubble horizon for Unruh waves that are the right wavelength to fit (see McCulloch, 2008, arxiv/astro-ph/0712.3022, section 4) so if the Unruh waves seen by the resonating em waves affect also the laser, then the acceleration is now 2c2 /(cavity size), which predicts an apparent path length change (due to a change in c). This is speculative in terms of the application of MiHsC, and not yet tested because of the incomplete data from NASA (they couldn't quantify their path length change) so I probably should not even mention it, but I do because it's important to have the habit of trying to connect theories back to 'all' the data."
EmDrive,3diiqn,memcculloch,2,Fri Jul 17 08:40:30 2015 UTC,"So does your theory predict that an object inside a reflective object has zero inertial mass, because NO unruh waves can fit? That doesn't seem right."
EmDrive,3diiqn,TortugaTerritory,2,Fri Jul 17 21:34:27 2015 UTC,"Good question, but no: for most of the accelerations we see on Earth, the Unruh wavelengths are incredibly long. Specifically the wavelength = 8c2 / a, where a is acceleration. So if a = 9.8 m/s2 the wavelength is 7x1016 m (~10 light years) so these waves do not interact with the box at all and the inertia of objects in mirrored or metal boxes is unaffected.  In contrast the light in the emdrive is accelerated so much as it bounces around at the speed of light that the Unruh waves are of a similar size to the box, so can interact with the walls."

You have this great idea and you plan on how you'll follow it up with a long course of action when you succeed at your instrumental goals. That's the problem though when you succeed. You seem to be assuming success from the outset, without consideration to possible setbacks, failures, shortfalls, or catastrophes along the way. A year might seem like a long time, but its really not. You're planning for what to do when your drive works, how to get it to Mars. That's great, but it relies on the drive actually working. All these plans about going to Elon Musk, designing a spaceship, and exploring the solarsystem are contingent on the damn thing actually producing useful thrust in the first place. Even if your drive manages to produce measurable thrust, its still a long, long way from building that spaceship. Don't worry about the future, don't worry about how the spaceship's windows will be shaped, don't worry about anything other then the instrumental goal of getting the drive to produce thrust. Until that happens, any further planning is worse then useless, it actively consumes time you could be using to focus on the instrumental goal of the drive itself.   Get the damn thing built and producing thrust, and then worry about the next steps. If you can't meet that first step, none of these grand plans matter."

EmDrive,3dgvdk,flux_capacitor78,2,Thu Jul 16 06:49:23 2015 UTC,Step by step engineering.  Shawyer reported 0.4N/kW at Q 50k. I believe +100k is doable. Force generation at 100K then goes to 0.8N/kW. Boosting Df to 0.95 will bring Force to +1N/kW
EmDrive,3dgvdk,kawfey,3,Thu Jul 16 08:46:58 2015 UTC,Cool. How do you measure Q?
EmDrive,3dgvdk,Sagebrysh,4,Thu Jul 16 08:49:17 2015 UTC,Unloaded Q is measured via the high and low frequencies that is 3bd down from the max Return Loss dB frequency.  Q = frequency of max return loss dB / (high frequency at 3dB down - low frequency of 3 dB down).  Bandwidth = high frequency at 3dB down - low frequency of 3 dB down.  Can be done measuring VSWR as you vary the frequency. VSWR relates directly to return loss as per the link below.  http://cgi.www.telestrian.co.uk/cgi-bin/www.telestrian.co.uk/vswr.pl
EmDrive,3dgvdk,ReisGuy,3,Thu Jul 16 09:10:32 2015 UTC,Shawyer reported 0.4N/kW at Q 50k   Could you please link me? That is very interesting!

Obviously, no one could build and test every conceivable EmDrive configuration.   As more and more data soon becomes available with so many builds going on, one hypothesis/theory for how the EmDrive produces thrust is going to win out.  If I had to put money on one hypothesis right now, I'd go with MiHsC.  Lets say that come November, we have results from 2-3 more EmDrive builds including the latest EW test. Lets say that the results fit nicely with predictions from MiHsC. Theory could then guide you in subsequent builds, suggesting the optimal length, big/small diameter, frustum material, cavity medium (air, partial vacuum, water, etc), etc."

EmDrive,3dgvdk,wallofwolfstreet,5,Fri Jul 17 18:54:29 2015 UTC,"What worries me the most in that example is the thrust decreased while the power increased, between 250W and 650W. What could possibly explain that weird behavior?  (the thrust then grows with power above 800W, as you can see in this other Chinese diagram)"
EmDrive,3dgvdk,Zouden,3,Fri Jul 17 20:39:38 2015 UTC,That curve dip is fully explained in the 2010 paper. Happened because the frustum input bandwidth slipped sideways and missed most of the magnetron output bandwidth. They have graphics to show what happened.
EmDrive,3dgvdk,wallofwolfstreet,1 point,Sat Jul 18 08:34:12 2015 UTC,Would this be due to thermal effects on the cavity or what? Wouldnt think so if the other diagram showed increasing thrust with increasing power.

It's almost guaranteed that the thrust produced by an Emdrive does not come from any known (i.e. computable) EM interaction, and programs like MEEP don't have any provisions to calculate EM waves inside a moving object. I wonder why people are putting so much effort into it."
EmDrive,3ddyf1,god_uses_a_mac,9,Wed Jul 15 19:39:38 2015 UTC,"I think the reasoning is more along the lines that the simulations may point to some unusual conditions being created inside the drive, which would trigger the unknown force. The unknown force will not be in the simulation, of course. It's a long shot, but it's their free time, right?  The other less-than-half-serious hypothesis is that MEEP simulations may indicate asymmetric force (arising from an integration error), which will somehow magically reflect the reality. That is, that the laws of physics have the same type of ""integration error"" built in.  Yet some other people may not understand what they are doing."
EmDrive,3ddyf1,sorrge,9,Wed Jul 15 21:02:02 2015 UTC,"Actually, that reminds me of a slightly interesting thought I had.

I'm not telling anyone not to do it, I'm just not sure if I personally would expect results."

EmDrive,3ddyf1,god_uses_a_mac,9,Wed Jul 15 20:06:23 2015 UTC,"Still not convinced. I feel like we need (a lot) more hard data about the anomalous thrust before computational models become seriously useful. Consider:  If the emdrive produces thrust (as we are all assuming it does):    If the model does not demonstrate thrust, it is incomplete, and the data is not trustworthy. (this is true even if it is not designed to demonstrate thrust) If the model does demonstrate thrust, the model is incorrect, because current physics does not allow for this to happen, and the data is not trustworthy.   Now, granted, this is more of an opinion than a fact. I'm just not making the connection from ""Incomplete model"" to ""Useful data"".  (I am aware that incomplete models can be useful, but there is an interaction occurring inside an emdrive that is 100% unexplainable using currently accepted physics, and that is the interaction that is being studied.)"

If you don't know how, just upload the .h5 files somewhere and we will analyze it.    These steps after installation really should be automated. Just dump logs what the changes were, and bruteforce through modifying everything to sample values and let it run overnight. If you're just editing a CSV and running meep+h5totxt, efficiency shouldn't really be a concern for the script, only for meep and h5totxt.  I'm out of the country and have some crazy deadlines for work I need to finish, but I wouldn't mind writing up some python to bruteforce this and dump logs sometime."

So to conserve momentum the frustum moves. You absolutely need resonating photons to produce thrust. It is much like the Woodward effect. Imagine a barge on still water with a huge stack of rocks on one side. Each time you move a heavy  rock from one side to the other the boat moves a tiny bit in the opposite direction. MiHsC provides an endless supply of rocks that appear just before you pick them up and dissappear when you drop them (simply because they have more inertial mass on one end as they do on the other).  But without resonating photons, nothing moves the rocks."

Momentum, spin, force, acceleration, mass, magnetic, electric forces of light, light is even a particle and a wave that exhibits quantum effects (slit experiment) and spooky actions of entanglement with superluminal instantaneous actions across long distances, evanescent waves like a stripped down version of a wave that can impart first order forces and control the movement of small particles. All of these forces and actions are carried in a wave. I keep remembering Einstein's equation E=MC2 and remind myself that light (energy) is simply a form of the forces that make matter what it is. If there is a formula for controlling mass and acceleration and warping spacetime like matter does it is in the waves (energy) on the other side of the equation. Making all this work like it does is the Quantum Vacuum of space-time.  There are about 12 theories out there and each has pluses and minuses understanding how the fundamental makeup of light (RF shoved into in the EMDrive) can be modified to give us an effect that takes us places with out thrust. We really are not violating anything but using what mother nature gave us in E=MC2"
EmDrive,3dac83,api,3,Tue Jul 14 19:00:58 2015 UTC,You are way off. Eagleworks measured 0.05mN. This is tiny. To give you some perspective. This is the acceleration a strong lightbulb gives you. Or the recoil you feel by taking a picture with a flash. (you cant even feel it). Surface tension and friction in water are to big to make this reliable. Then there is the interaction of the magnetic field with water (which can be magnetized weakly). You can literally bend the surface of water by putting a strong magnet next to it (which the emdrive is). You also need to float all of it. The weight and size of all that make this even more improbable. You won't see thrust and the error sources of the water are huge.
EmDrive,3dac83,idemandstuff,2,Wed Jul 15 11:56:57 2015 UTC,Aren't some people talking about 1N/kW? That would easily be measurable on a water surface.

NASA then disavowed the wilder claims being made and kept silent about all else.  Until NASA releases an official report on their findings they aren't on the hook for a damn thing. If they verify thrust then they are praised, if they prove null thrust the story loses life and dies a slow death in the field of conspiracy and pseudoscience.

As an aside... don't give up on cold fusion just yet - it might not produce much energy that we can capture and use, but fusing atoms up the table of elements is happening (Toyota, Mitsubishi, et al.).

EmDrive,3d79lt,Ashtar_Squirrel,5,Tue Jul 14 18:51:42 2015 UTC,"I believe there is something there. Nasa isn't on the line, I think they have uncorked a gene in a bottle that even they are finding hard to control.   They are too many widely varying tests in different configurations from small companies,  accredited facilities, to someone's kitchen reporting small and varying levels of thrust. And these are the only ones that are open that we know about. I've no idea what is behind closed doors. http://emdrive.wiki/Experimental_Results  Here is the kicker which defines the problem we're facing.  I believe it's very hard to control to get thrust that's meaningful.  Getting thrust is like squeezing a slippery fish harder to hold onto it. Looking at it on the surface it seems simple as shoving a old microwave magnetron into a tuna can and off we go. It's not. We're dealing with high frequency waveforms (that's the slippery fish) in a asymmetrical (varying dimensions) resonate cavity operating where the thickness in a piece of paper due from heating can kill the thrust. Into this we introduce microwaves via waveguides, and dipole antennas, single, dual, 1/4 phase shifted dipoles, injecting irises, multi RF stubs placed in a cavity. Then we have varying sized of cavities and lengths and materials and superconducting or not, and different Q (resonance and quality of tuning) and why some tests with hi Q did't work and some did. RF sources some 50% duty cycle on and off worked better, some didn't. Some with the spewing bandwidth of a magnetron worked better, some didn't. This is the just the surface.  I think it works and would be very surprised if it doesn't, it's just a very slippery fish.  First. If we had a solid non-refutable theory of just how this works we could tighten up the controls specifically from those equations that make the thrust and apply it to a real build. We don't. The're around 12 different theories why it does what it does. The slippery fish is not only for us builders, it's for the physicists and theorists too.  Second. Too many tests, too may outputs, not enough controls to get meaningful data. Do a test of a basic design like RS's or the Chinese Yang's, get thrust, do it again and again, power spectra, frequency sweeps, temperature monitoring, humidity and record.  Make one detailed and documented design change. Record it. Step after step after step.   Third. Define the areas that increase thrust. Put controls on the magnifiers that don't.   Fourth. Get more thrust and refine and put better controls. Test it in a vacuum, filled with air, with unusual forms of matter. Record refine control all over again.  Personally I'm not building a hang on the shower curtain weekend glory getting hope of thrust. I'm planning to methodically go after and catch that slippery EMDrive, step after calculated step. I have some ideas that I will be including that I believe will be a record catch, but let me build the first one.   From the first meaningful rocket, the V2 to the incredible Saturn V that took us to the moon only took 30 years, we have been plugging along on this for 20, it's getting close, I can feel it.

We are at those first steps again, to prove the EMDrive works (no dogs or elephants thank goodness) and who knows what lurks behind any of those closed doors in labs. I don't know, but if I was alive during Tesla's time I'd be doing what I am doing now, building and testing just maybe the next technological leap for us all.

Furthermore, if the thrust is generated by ordinary means then it may occur in current systems and NASA will be able to correct their models and adjust for thrust changes.

He listened quietly as the two continued to argue and finally interrupted & said,   ""I know how many teeth a horse has.""  The 1 Greek asked him ""How do you know? What was your reasoning?""  The Arab said, ""I counted them. 36 teeth.""  This is how the debates will be settled. And have seen that few sides really argue very long about what's going on. (Unlike the philosophers!) They are too busy thinking about ways they can test their models and think up new models to explain what they are still finding.  The kinds of metal alloys used for the frustra probably also may influence the efficiencies of the shapes.  Our surprise at this totally unexpected finding of the EMDrive, totally unpredicted by any of our models, showed once again, yet another of the many scores of basic discoveries in the last 50 years which have shown us,  repeatedly, how clearly that ""most all of our models are incomplete"".  https://jochesh00.wordpress.com/2014/09/03/beyond-the-absolute-limits-to-knowledge/  https://jochesh00.wordpress.com/2015/06/19/the-fox-the-hedgehog/  This describes further the LEP and explains more about why our models are incomplete. As the ""Nature"" article recently published, the English Robin has likely the most efficient known quantum magnetometer, likely a bit of two entangled particles inside a molecular cage, vs. the human version, a large closet sized, SC Q magnetometer, weighing many orders of magnitude larger, as well...."
EmDrive,3d4s3q,tchernik,3,Mon Jul 13 18:39:29 2015 UTC,"Yes. It's still open to many possibilities.  Either it becomes the discovery of the century, or an embarrassing side note on the history of wrong scientific ideas.  Currently, I still think it would be the former, because it has more evidence in its favor than any other similar ideas in the past.  My biggest concern is that experiments in a vacuum tend to show the ""mysteriously vanishing thrust"" other similar thrusters (e.g. Woodward's ME thruster) show when inspected under much more careful conditions.  AFAIK currently there are two confirmed partial vacuum replications (NASA's EW and now Martin Tajmar's), and both show very low thrust.  While the Chinese one shows a very remarkable level of thrust, but so far hasn't been replicated in a vacuum.  In any case: I do think vacuum only experiments have much more weight when assessing if there is something going on or not. I'd just suggest they explore all the alternatives: air filled cavity in air, vacuum cavity in air, vacuum cavity in a vacuum AND air filled cavity in a vacuum because it has been suggested before that the Emdrive may require there is a gas inside the cavity for working better, and the recent results in NSF forum by Rodal suggest there is an actual asymmetric stress tensor in there, which may need to interact with a medium like a ionized gas in order to produce any force."
EmDrive,3d4s3q,Zouden,7,Mon Jul 13 17:05:54 2015 UTC,"My biggest concern is that experiments in a vacuum tend to show the ""mysteriously vanishing thrust"" other similar thrusters (e.g. Woodward's ME thruster) show when inspected under much more careful conditions.   Yep, that's my biggest concern too. If removing most of the air eliminated most of the thrust, then the logical conclusion is that air is required for the emdrive to work. I hope this is disproven soon."
EmDrive,3d4s3q,daronjay,3,Mon Jul 13 18:47:25 2015 UTC,Increasing the density of the gas in the cavity might yield interesting results in that case
EmDrive,3d4s3q,Zouden,3,Tue Jul 14 05:45:42 2015 UTC,"Well I think it's probably just that the air allows for thermal effects.   But... it's worth noting that Dr McCulloch's formula for calculating EmDrive thrust predicts that thrust would increase if the cavity is filled with something that slows the speed of light, like air or water. It could only improve thrust by at most 2x, though."
EmDrive,3d4s3q,KaiserAbides,4,Tue Jul 14 08:24:56 2015 UTC,"then the logical conclusion is that air is required for the emdrive to work.   Which I'm fine with as long as it isn't simply pushing the air (Lifter effect.) If it needs air to work then we can put it in the middle of the ship and surround it with air. My real fear is that it will require air to produce actual workable thrust for some strange reason we have yet to comprehend, but will be dropped because it doesn't work in vacuum."
EmDrive,3d4s3q,tchernik,5,Mon Jul 13 20:47:52 2015 UTC,That's why combinations of experiments with air and vacuum inside and outside the cavity need to be performed.  The gases inside it maybe part of what makes them work.
EmDrive,3d4s3q,BlaineMiller,6,Mon Jul 13 20:58:58 2015 UTC,"Indeed, I agree with everything you just said.  Now, about Dr. Rodal's suggestions of asymmetric stress tensors that grow with time....Is it not possible to assertain this is the case by creating a hermetically sealed cavity?  After all, the ionized gas would have to escape.  It is explainable by ordinary classical physics.  But, if thrust is still shown after it is sealed, then extraordinary physics is at work."

Aside from surviving w/ dinosaurs, we had less biofuel to use to drive our advancement to that of leveraging machines to do labor.  If other planets don't have massive amounts of fuel, they may never get to the point of rockets.  Another SciFi writer pointed out that, Earth's gravity is large, but not that large, and if our planet had more mass, rocket fuel might not have been sufficient to even make space exploration possible.  It might really be a combination of gravitational mass vs. fuel abundance."
EmDrive,3d4ywx,jdavid,15,Mon Jul 13 16:22:48 2015 UTC,"Well holy shit.  I had never even considered the fossil fuel aspect.   I wonder how much that narrows the odds down? You would need a massive biosphere of relatively complex life to collapse suddenly and with the proper conditions in order to get mass fossil fuel creation.   After that massive level extinction event (but not big enough to kill off ALL complex life) you would need the rise of a second start of highly complex life that advances enough to be able to utilize this ""extinction fuel"".   I imagine that would seriously limit the amount of worlds in which a complex species can not only reach a level of sentience, but be able to fully utilize their intelligence with cheap, abundant fuel sources for machinery and industry.  Maybe the universe is full of highly intelligent species trapped on their fuel-less worlds?"

It's certainly possible--we had industry based on wind and water power before using fossil fuels much after all--but getting there would be a slow transition if it succeded at all. The modern Earth economy is so dependent on fossil fuels it's not even funny. They're what enabled such rapid development of manufacturing and distribution technologies."

Hydrogen couldn't be used because it couldn't even drive the engine, (I think it was a problem with the compression ratio, I'm not sure) liquid hydrogen worked but was exceedingly impractical to obtain in the 19th century, and finally gasoline was used as a fuel of choice because it has a very large energy density and is fairly light. (Gasoline is less dense than water)  A civilization with technology equivalent to ours during the 19th century and without access to fossil fuels would probably have considered the same fuels but settled on ethanol or propanol because they are the most readily available, are relatively lightweight and have higher energy densities than all other fuel sources available to them. The availability of biomass for use in fermentation and alcohol production would then be a limiting factor in the popularity of an automobile using an alien ICE, so they probably wouldn't be as common as our automobiles. It's also possible they would have considered electric cars as a better alternative, assuming they had battery technology equivalent to or exceeding our 19th century equivalent."

Except 360 million years ago, fungi didn't have the ability to break down lignin, so all the dead trees essentially just piled up. For 60 million years. All that wood that piled up became coal, and that's why we have so goddamned much of it."

EmDrive,3d4ywx,drewsy888,3,Tue Jul 14 15:38:21 2015 UTC,Also there may be a great filter involved with fossil fuels. In only ~200 years from when we started using fossil fuels we will have made huge changes to the Earth's atmosphere causing all kinds of issues on Earth which have the potential to completely destroy the human race (think nuclear war as resources become more scarce) or at least set up back a long ways (maybe causing us to give up space travel).  So think about how fossil fuels have allowed us to advance to the stage where we can develop something like an em drive and just get into space at all and how those same fossil fuels may destroy us.
EmDrive,3d4ywx,SplitReality,3,Mon Jul 13 17:55:46 2015 UTC,"Also think about the fact that if fossil fuel use can be a great filter on civilizations, then it is incredibly likely to happen?

EmDrive,3d4ywx,kowdermesiter,8,Mon Jul 13 18:59:09 2015 UTC,"Fossil fuels shouldn't be a limiting factor. In the early stages of a civilization, it's helpful, acts like a catalyzer, because it's so easy to exploit. Maybe on other planets they were smarter and started and migrated to renewable energy sources pretty soon. We are not that late either, but I don't see mankind as a smart tactical race on long term thinking.   The solar energy that hits one square mile in a year is equivalent to 4 million barrels of oil.

EmDrive,3d4ywx,SplitReality,4,Mon Jul 13 20:48:43 2015 UTC,"There could be a technology gap that is very difficult to jump without easy access to fossil fuels. For example look a virtual reality. There was interest in the tech in the 80s and nineties but it didn't catch on because the basic tech wasn't there to support it. More importantly the basic tech was so far out at the time that the desire of VR wasn't enough to push for its development.  Fortunately computers in general could make good use of the tech at the time so it was able to drive advancements. Then smart phones made it big and suddenly there was a lot of research into small screen displays. Now that the basic tech is in place, pure VR research can be funded and it is a billion dollar industry.   The point is that without computers and smartphones bridging the gap, VR would have been unlikely. The same could be true for solar. Just because the energy is there doesn't mean that it can be used. The tech built up by using fossil fuels helped us create the tech needed to harness solar. Without the former its hard to get the latter."
EmDrive,3d4ywx,kowdermesiter,4,Mon Jul 13 19:22:58 2015 UTC,"Sure, technologies are built on top of each other and that's of course normal. There's no clear path however. We can just say what worked in our case. If you look at the history of automobiles, you can ask the question why didn't electric vehicles take off? They had a little (but solvable) disadvantage, but the tech was solid in the early 1900s: http://www.detroitelectric.org/ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_05ddNt_-8  We could have taken another road with these cars and we probably would still ended up here.  If the energy is there, it can be used. It just depends on how motivated we are. If electric cars would have taken off, we probably would started to think about harnessing solar much sooner."

Modern humans exist in such a small time frame with regard to the creation of fossil fuels. We could have been around 5 million years ago and still had plenty of it. The gotcha part about the paradox is that it is extremely unlikely that humans on earth are the first intelligent life in the galaxy to evolve. There should have been millions (thousands?) of civilizations that existed millions of years before us.  Although it still is a good limiting factor to think about. A planet needs enough time to create easily accessible fossil fuels that civilizations can exploit. On the other hand fossil fuels could be a limiting factor itself. According to some dire predictions, humans have already burned enough fossil fuels to make our life pretty uncomfortable in 100 years. That could put a huge damper on our desire and ability to project evidence of our existence beyond our solar system."

EmDrive,3d4ywx,Sledgecrushr,2,Mon Jul 13 18:25:50 2015 UTC,"The gravity thing is a really good point. Even with a tiny increase in gravity; air density would be slightly higher, meaning more friction and more heat shielding required, so we would now need to have heavier ships fighting slightly higher gravity, meaning more fuel which also increases weight which could end up causing spaceflight to be much harder to accomplish. Not to mention the potential delays in flight technology from the earliest flight tests being more difficult.  Another problem from any increase to gravity would be that in order to survive animals would have needed to have stronger muscles (especially the heart, assuming they use hearts maybe they use tracheal breathing which might be more efficient in higher densities) which would make higher intelligence even more unlikely. It would also lower the average lifespan of any creatures on land as falls would both be more damaging and harder to dissipate the damage (with higher gravity comes faster acceleration meaning you have less time to attempt to stop your fall) so accidental death would most likely be more of a problem.  Perhaps most importantly for a higher gravity planet is that it would make it much harder for life to leave the ocean/bodies of liquid and the chances of any aquatic (or whatever they would be called for non water based liquids) based life leaving their respective planet is very low.

It was early October, 1957, right around my birthday and as little as I was I remember as clear today as then. When I remember I still hold my breath. Sputnik was the first artificial Earth satellite.  Many years have passed and I lived through the hippy days, watched every launch by NASA, met a couple of real astronauts, the moon landing (held my breath then too), Viet Nam winding down, the cold war, Iraq and poof here it is now. During my career through those times I never forgot that little light in the heavens. I want to be able to hold my breath again for something in the now, this is why I'm dedicating my time and effort to building a EMDrive."

There could be tons of planets with earth like life, minus the intelligent inhabitants."
EmDrive,3d4ywx,artthoumadbrother,5,Mon Jul 13 16:05:00 2015 UTC,"Yes, #1 is the Ockham's Razor answer.  It also has some support from the realm of computational artificial life, where evolution-in-silico experiments have shown that it's actually very hard to get complexity to keep increasing in an evolving system. Evolving ecosystems tend to get stuck at Nash equilibria. Maybe something about Earth is special and kept that from happening. Without getting stuck at a Nash equilibrium, the Red Queen's race (the other force) keeps going and drives things to high complexity and intelligence. Hence... this.  Kind of dull though. We'd get out there and find lots of warm, wet worlds covered by endless mats of bacteria and maybe some microbes reproducing in subsurface oceans or on comets. But nothing to talk to. But on the plus side, there would be nothing shooting at us either.  Option 3 is probably next in line on the probability scale, since my somewhat-informed gut tells me a #2 intelligence would blow itself away first. Look at the Middle East for a small scale example of what very intelligent xenophobes do to each other, and with RKKVs and similar utter doomsday weapons easy to build you do not get an act two."
EmDrive,3d4ywx,SplitReality,2,Mon Jul 13 16:11:41 2015 UTC,"I'd think the most likely scenario is that intelligent life isn't extremely rare and that the great filter is still ahead of is. So far every time humans have tried to declare themselves special in the universe, the universe has laughed at us.  I just looked up Nash equilibria so my knowledge on the subject is effectively nil, but my initial impression is that it assumes a stable environment. Radical changes in the environment like asteroid impacts, super volcanoes and so on would tend to shuffle the deck from time to time and increase the chance for diversity."
EmDrive,3d4ywx,SplitReality,2,Mon Jul 13 18:29:23 2015 UTC,"If something like the EmDrive works, that becomes a much less likely option... since it means we are perhaps decades (or less) away from beginning interstellar expansion. Star flight would instantly become something that could be done with present-day technology. The development of something like this is literally the ""Zefram Cochrane moment.""  If something like this appeared, I could see governments prioritizing space again since there would now be a significantly wider and longer list of places we could go. Right now Mars is the only good other destination for humans, and honestly it's not that good... a nearly airless frozen desert. But look at how many extrasolar planets Kepler has found? I'd be surprised if superpower governments wouldn't immediately see the potential long term strategic implications of not moving forward with exploration. We wouldn't want the entire universe to belong to the Chinese, now would we?  We assume that the laws of physics are the same across the entire universe, so if something like this is possible then it should be raining aliens. That's the paradox."

EmDrive,3d4ywx,Jeffgoldbum,2,Tue Jul 14 02:15:02 2015 UTC,I think you are being way too optimistic about when interstellar travel would happen if we had a working EmDrive. First off just to get to our nearest neighbor Alpha Centauri would take around 100 years to get there and would be a non decelerating fly by. There would be near zero political will to fund a trip that would take over three generations to see any results and when it happened it'd be pretty minimal since the spacecraft would be going around 10% of the speed of light at the time.   And that would be just going to our nearest neighbor. I'd say it'd be at least a 100 years before we even attempted that 100 year trip flyby. We would not be going any further than that for quite some time after that. So if the earth goes belly up within 200 years it'd be pretty easy to miss that lone ship in space.
EmDrive,3d4ywx,Magnesus,2,Mon Jul 13 19:54:44 2015 UTC,"At 0.2c it would take ~20 years to reach the Centauri system, which is theoretically achievable. Unless I'm remembering wrong the extreme blue shifted radiation problems don't become a big issue until ~0.6c or so.  For those who don't know: as you accelerate, oncoming light is blue-shifted. Eventually it becomes gamma rays. There's also an effect (due to length contraction) where your field of view is distorted as you approach c:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CIs3jOnfiM  As you near 'c', all the ambient light and EM energy around you transforms into a narrowly focused beam of gamma rays aimed right at the front of your craft. Shielding gamma rays is hard, but this probably isn't anywhere near as hard of a problem as getting close to 'c' in the first place.  Edit: I wonder if you could take advantage of that gamma radiation to drive a fusion reaction?"
EmDrive,3d4ywx,possibles12,5,Mon Jul 13 20:55:41 2015 UTC,"EmDrives have a slow constant acceleration so you wouldn't be going .2c from the very first second. You would be slowly building up to it. And if you want to actually stop at Alpha Centauri you can't accelerate all the way there. At the halfway point you have to turn your ship around and start slowing down.  Here is the NASA Space Flight article where I got my original estimates.   Mr. Joosten and Dr. White stated that “a one-way, non-decelerating trip to Alpha Centauri under a constant one milli-g acceleration” from an EM drive would result in an arrival speed of 9.4 percent the speed of light and result in a total transit time from Earth to Alpha Centauri of just 92 years.  However, if the intentions of such a mission were to perform in-situ observations and experiments in the Alpha Centauri system, then deceleration would be needed.  This added component would result in a 130-year transit time from Earth to Alpha Centauri – which is still a significant improvement over the multi-thousand year timetable such a mission would take using current chemical propulsion technology.  http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2015/04/evaluating-nasas-futuristic-em-drive/"

We were so close to killing ourselves on multiple occasions but got very very lucky again and again.

I'll admit that it is just my speculation right now, because I don't feel like doing a research paper for Reddit reply. I'd say the main reason to support the idea that intelligent life isn't rare is that to say otherwise is to say that intelligent life on earth is special in our galaxy, and there is nothing that distinguishes the earth from millions of other planets.  I can think of some pretty big filter events that we could reason. The first is biological terrorism. People are worried about nuclear weapons by the ability to design biological viruses is getting easier and easier. As a result it becomes more and more likely that someone will create and release one that take out a significant portion of the population.  Another thing isn't a filter in its own right, by our interdependence makes us more vulnerable or would magnify any other great filter. Simply being without the comforts of modern technology would kill many people. So for example a solar flare that knocks out our power grids would cripple the world.   Adding another to the list would be massive social unrest to to automation. No I am not talking about terminators gunning people down. What I mean is that automation could reduce the need for human workers. While that should be a good thing, it is going to cause major disruptions. Imagine what would happen if 80% of the populace are permanently unemployed. Does the remaining 20% just decide to voluntarily pay for the other 80%, or do they try to hold on to as much as they can as the economy crumbles due to global demand plummeting?

That doesn't solve the problem. You just can get around that our planet isn't that special and there are a lot of other planets out there. As far as gravity, just look at our own solar system. Out of the planets around the habitable zone,  earth, venus and mars, earth is the big one. There is no indication at all that earth is on the small side.

Does the remaining 20% just decide to voluntarily pay for the other 80%, or do they try to hold on to as much as they can as the economy crumbles due to global demand plummeting?   Well, what matters then is maintaining the mechanisms of democracy. People say that western nations are oligarchies, and they aren't really wrong, but they're oligarchies because people are ignorant enough to allow politicians to do things against their best interest. If you don't have a job, and virtually everyone you know doesn't have a job, and you know that the rich have trillions of dollars each, getting a majority voter block together to demand something like a UBI won't be hard.    or do they try to hold on to as much as they can as the economy crumbles due to global demand plummeting?   This would even be incentive for the rich to demand UBI after a certain point.    You just can get around that our planet isn't that special   Or maybe it is. We don't know. The lack of messages from space could point to this.   There is no indication at all that earth is on the small side.   We've spotted quite a few super earths in habitable zones. Maybe there was something strange about our solar system during its early stages that caused none to coalesce, but if the material in the habitable zone is being used up by one or two super earths than there probably won't be Earth-size or smaller rocky planets near the same orbit. In the case of super earths, it is infinitely harder to get to space---to launch satellites even.

It's very simple why we have no contact. They don't NEED to have contact with us.

Why expand and colonize when there is no need to? I think that's the single point that so many people miss with this sort of discussion.

Because reducing the complexity of travelling through space by orders of magnitude would make their absence even more unexplainable.   Nevertheless, I believe the solution is  that life, or rather, intelligent life might be rarer than we believe. We could be practically alone in a very big volume of space, possibly as big or bigger than the observable universe.  But maybe not in this Solar System, though, because it's very possible that life from Earth has passed to other bodies in this planetary system thanks to the exchange of material due to meteoric impacts, or viceversa, life from other bodies around the Sun could have arrived to Earth long ago and that's why we are here now.  Of course: there is also the possibility that the paradox is not such a thing, and that they have been here for a long while and we are being purposefully quarantined or kept unaware of their existence by those same extraterrestrial intelligences. With only fleeting views of their presence given to us by accident or by careful choice.  Curiously, I don't think both ideas contradict each other: if M-theory is right and they come from other branes or parallel universes, we could be seeing authentic aliens and still never find anyone else in this universe.  We could have all the space in a universe to roam and expand, and still, we could continue needing some place for mystery and the unknown represented by truly alien intelligences.

To an outside observer -- say someone on the Earth -- a near light speed ship would take a bit more than 2.5 million years to reach Andromeda. But if the ship were traveling close to 'c', its occupants might experience that time as being centuries, decades, or even just a few years depending on how close to 'c' you could actually get. (It's exponential if I remember correctly.) If you could get really close to 'c', it would subjectively take hours.  Obviously we are not counting time to accelerate to cruising speed. That would take decades unless you could tap into some crazy source of energy like matter/antimatter catalyzed fusion or something. Rapid acceleration would also be limited by the maximum thrust and efficiency our hypothetical EmDrive can achieve... and in the high thrust case, by what you can withstand. No good accelerating so fast you arrive as a thin layer of red jelly at the rear of your cockpit.  So when the ship arrived in Andromeda, a short period of time would have passed for its occupants. But for us back on Earth we'd be in the next geological epoch. It would be achievable, but it would also be a one way trip since it's a trip forward through time as well as through space.  Other than energy and propulsion, the last huge problem with travel at this speed is that anything you encounter would be deadly. A dust particle would carry a tactical nuke's worth of (relative) kinetic energy. So travel that fast would be impossible without some means of deflecting things somehow."

That is, the ship's clock (and according to relativity, any human traveling with it) shows less elapsed time than the clocks of observers on earth.

It's just a waiting game right now, we should see more results at the end of the month."
EmDrive,3d5p1e,Zimtower,3,Mon Jul 13 19:46:48 2015 UTC,"In the case of the hackaday project the thrust is still too small to be accurately measured. kml's first measurements turned out to be radio frequency interference with a digital scale because the effect was reproducable by using an antenna. As I understand it, future testers are not using digital scales."
EmDrive,3d5r4l,GuyRichard,9,Mon Jul 13 19:08:43 2015 UTC,"Yes, and it's still summer."
EmDrive,3d5r4l,Yuli-Ban,6,Mon Jul 13 20:55:04 2015 UTC,"I'd be surprised if we hear any more about it until several definitive tests are performed and reproduced in different places. I can just imagine how the people involved at NASA got chewed out for discussing things in a public forum and having the discussion go viral.  And even then if it is convincingly successful, who know what sort of a lock down might happen. The military would probably want dibs on it. There might be fear over its potential uses for terrorism."
EmDrive,3d5r4l,ConfirmedCynic,4,Mon Jul 13 19:47:13 2015 UTC,Terrorism always seems like the perfect excuse to suppress advanced technologies that could lead to a better life for the entire human race.

EmDrive,3d5r4l,BlaineMiller,4,Mon Jul 13 19:40:13 2015 UTC,"Actually, I was pretty sure some of the NSF forum conversation was centered around the idea that the EMdrive may be ""warping"" space.  Now, that would make it a ""warp"" drive by definition, but probably not the Star Trek type you are thinking."
EmDrive,3d5r4l,hms11,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:47:57 2015 UTC,"exactly. I true warp drive would take much more energy, theoretically, but what ever happened with the test that EagleWorks performed which resulted in a laser travelling faster than the speed of light?  It may not be a warp drive, but there could be some type of phenomenon possibly associated with the resonant frequencies of the microwaves.  I would like to see others repeat this experiment.  Has anyone from Eagleworks, Nasa, or on the forums been able to explain if this test really obtained faster than light observations?"
EmDrive,3d5r4l,greenepc,2,Mon Jul 13 22:52:55 2015 UTC,They didn't announce that it traveled faster than light. They announced that the variations in the path length of the laser beam was 40x higher than expected based on thermal variations alone.

EmDrive,3d5r4l,ImAClimateScientist,2,Tue Jul 14 02:28:48 2015 UTC,"That's what I'm talking about. It was potentially ""warping space"" but not in the way we traditionally think of doing it (warp bubble around ship, send ship somewhere at FTL speeds). It was more of an internal warp field, potentially dragging the device forward.   One of many theories of operation, as far as I know."
EmDrive,3d5r4l,hms11,1 point,Tue Jul 14 12:03:05 2015 UTC,"If it does warp space, can it be scaled up?"
EmDrive,3d5r4l,diythrow24234,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:58:34 2015 UTC,"I think it is way too early to tell at this point. Like I said, they are not even sure that is what's happening, just that it is a possibility.  I can't see any reason that it wouldn't be scalable, but really, it still wouldn't be the warp drive you are imagining, because they space warping is happening inside the drive, regardless of how big it is."
EmDrive,3d5r4l,hms11,-1,Wed Jul 15 16:19:55 2015 UTC,"Wrong, I am just closely reading everything and understanding what comes out of nasa and the nsf forums.  Nasa has said it wasn't an warp drive very blatantly in a response to the press.  A real warp drive would be the Alcubiere drive, period."
EmDrive,3d5r4l,BlaineMiller,2,Tue Jul 14 03:27:35 2015 UTC,"Different type of ""warp drive"".  I think you missed what I am saying. There have been indications that it ""warps"" the space in the drive somehow. NOT an Alcubiere style drive that creates a warp bubble but a very small bubble of ""warped space"" within the frustram.  Once again, that could end up being completely wrong, it was just one of the theories mentioned for why this thing works."

EmDrive,3d2inj,Ashtar_Squirrel,3,Mon Jul 13 03:32:32 2015 UTC,"Have you considered that the 2.45 Ghz band used is exactly in the Bluetooth frequency range, and thus might make the wireless measurements difficult to pick-up."
EmDrive,3d2inj,daronjay,3,Mon Jul 13 15:29:36 2015 UTC,"Yes I do realise the frequencies involved. The EMDrive, the 100W Rf amp and the Rf generator will be inside a Faraday Cage designed to stop any leakage. Likewise the EMDrive is also designed to stop any leakage. It is constructed from 2mm thick copper.  I can place the BT dongle from the Raspberry on the top of a post, in the centre of the turntable, and use an BT dongle from the laptop directly above but not touching it."
EmDrive,3d2inj,daronjay,2,Tue Jul 14 05:52:18 2015 UTC,"IIRC, you said previously that your test devices would be 20w? Have you managed to find a small enough 100w substitute or am I not reading the data right?"
EmDrive,3d2inj,ImAClimateScientist,4,Mon Jul 13 03:51:39 2015 UTC,"Yup, found a nice wide band 500MHz to 3GHz 100W amp that also has the auxiliary control and reporting capability I need."
EmDrive,3d2inj,ImAClimateScientist,2,Mon Jul 13 03:58:59 2015 UTC,"Sweet, more power has got be good for the reproducibility.   I wonder how much weight you would need to add to the turntable to slow the rotation speed at which the energy paradox ought to occur down enough that the device wouldn't long ago have self destructed from centrifugal forces. I believe someone calculated the spin required to reach that point with a 10kg device of the diameter specified to be around 1800 rotations per second!   Might there be a sweet spot of extra (very well balanced) mass vs base input power level that would bring that breakeven figure down to something more practically achievable, I don't know, 100 rotations per second, 6000 rpm? (still sounds pretty damn fast to me)  Purpose of this would be to ""prove"" that we have an actual paradox that needs sorting out by actually reaching that energy point."
EmDrive,3d2inj,fittitthroway,6,Mon Jul 13 04:49:26 2015 UTC,1st goal: Provide undeniable evidence that Shawyer's EMDrive generates Force without using any propellant.  2nd goal: Develop the operational characteristics to establish the rate of electrical power supply energy consumed to Force and Acceleration delivered.  3rd goal: Provide undeniable evidence that Shawyer theory is correct.

Science is built upon testing hypotheses, not providing ""undeniable evidence"" for a priori conclusions.   That term reminds me of a creationist who can contort  any fact to fit their view. Even the Grand Canyon can support the ""undeniable fact"" that God created the Earth in six days if you look at the evidence through a twisted enough lens.  Don't get me wrong though, I think that overall this verification program is commendable. I think our differences here are mainly semantic/philosophical."
EmDrive,3d2inj,goocy,3,Mon Jul 13 14:12:41 2015 UTC,"My hypotheses is:  Does the EMDrive generate Force without needing propellants and does it convert some of the electrical energy in the batteries into continuous acceleration?  I intend to test that hypothesis and publish the very detailed data, no matter what the result.  Past experimental data from others suggests it will do that but I intent to test it never the less."

EmDrive,3d2inj,daronjay,-1,Mon Jul 13 11:47:16 2015 UTC,The proof will be self evident.  Watching a live video stream of an EMDrive accelerating for 5 -1 0 minutes will be very hard to deny.
EmDrive,3d2inj,Zouden,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:01:35 2015 UTC,"Oh, I was saying that because there is no definitive proof in science at all, except in calculus. It's all just evidence, some more convincing than other."
EmDrive,3d2inj,daronjay,0,Mon Jul 13 14:07:52 2015 UTC,"Will be hard to deny 5-10 minutes of continuous acceleration / velocity increase. Upper limit will be determined by the lesser of battery capacity, air resistance and table balance,"
EmDrive,3d2inj,flux_capacitor78,4,Mon Jul 13 14:21:48 2015 UTC,"Mass doesn't affect the breakeven point. If you do the maths for either a linear or a rotational setup it works out to be 1/x, where x is the emdrive efficiency in terms of N/W.  /u/TheTravellerEMD estimates he'll observe 60mN from 100W. The breakeven speed is then 100/0.06 or 1666m/s. That's 6000km/h.  I think it won't be possible to test for CoE violations until a superconducting EmDrive is developed."
EmDrive,3d2inj,TortugaTerritory,4,Mon Jul 13 07:02:06 2015 UTC,"I suggest the proof will be there as soon as the rate of electrical energy consumed per rate of Force / Acceleration delivered is seen.  Shawyer has already, in effect, published that data, just no one until I came along, worked out what it meant.  https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B7kgKijo-p0idEo4S2QzQXhLVzg/view?usp=sharing  In the above link of the Demonstrator EMDrive test on the rotary test rig, I copy and pasted an inverted Velocity curve under the dropping magnetron Power consumption curve. This shows that as Velocity increased, the magnetron for some reason delivered less Rf energy into the cavity, thus dropping the Power drawn from the electrical supply by the magnetron.  I trust you understand what that means."

Hopefully your experiments will change that."
EmDrive,3cx0ke,Marzhall,11,Sat Jul 11 14:55:59 2015 UTC,"I'm inclined to think they have been given the word to tighten up their output so its definitive, not speculative.

EmDrive,3cwgpg,Zouden,-1,Sat Jul 11 17:37:20 2015 UTC,"You need to ask yourself why copper mesh is not used in the microwave industry to build waveguides? Would be heaps lighter, lower weight and cost.  Might be because mesh it is good at absorbing microwave energy that strikes it but bad at reflecting / propogating microwave energy that strikes it.  The inside of your cavity needs to be very highly polished, ding & scratch free rigid copper that reflects and propogates microwave energy with VERY little energy loss, instead of absorbing the energy and turning it into heat."
EmDrive,3cwgpg,TheTravellerEMD,9,Sat Jul 11 11:58:16 2015 UTC,"As I understood OP, he is only considering using the metal mesh as a faraday cage around the device to protect himself, not for constructing the frustum itself."

EmDrive,3cwgpg,TheTravellerEMD,1 point,Sat Jul 11 22:29:42 2015 UTC,"The problem I would expect for using a ~1kW magnetron with 0.5mm copper sheeting is thermal-induced warping of the frustum. You might be better off finding a lower power narrower-band RF source or a thicker frustum. But, obviously, if copper sheet and a microwave magnetron is all you have, it is better than nothing."
EmDrive,3cwgpg,ummwut,6,Sat Jul 11 22:57:47 2015 UTC,"I thought that would be the case too, but I've been corrected about that in the past - apparently if the mesh is finer than the wavelength, it acts like a mirror. That's why satellite dishes are often made out of a mesh."
EmDrive,3cwgpg,AcidicVagina,-2,Sat Jul 11 13:54:13 2015 UTC,"Acts like is not the same as a finely polished surface. Antenna have holes to reduce mass and air resistance.  As I said, show me a copper mesh waveguide. The EMDrive is a tapered waveguide and not an antenna."
EmDrive,3cwgpg,See-Shell,1 point,Sat Jul 11 15:01:59 2015 UTC,"Fair enough, I certainly don't know enough about the topic!  That said, avoiding the buoyancy problem is a big advantage to using a mesh."
EmDrive,3cwgpg,TheTravellerEMD,-3,Sat Jul 11 16:15:42 2015 UTC,"Use a copper mesh means no Force will be generated. So it is not the way to overcome the problem.

EmDrive,3cvyg5,kowdermesiter,13,Sat Jul 11 11:19:54 2015 UTC,Did you read the start of paragraph 2?  Nothing will happen until I publish my test results. The rotating table experiments will be streamed live over the Internet.  I have no doubt I will suceed as many others in the past have done. It is not like this is the 1st ever EMDrive test as the 1st Force measurements were done by Roger Shawyer 2000-2002. So I'm 15 years behind his 1st Force measurements.
EmDrive,3cvyg5,emdrive_gawker,1 point,Sat Jul 11 11:31:08 2015 UTC,I think you are being overconfident in your build of the EmDrive. It's operation is still theoretical. I think it makes a lot more sense to test your device before putting a bunch of them in the mail. What if you are wrong and your device only produces 100uN? Then what?
EmDrive,3cvyg5,kowdermesiter,5,Sat Jul 11 16:27:20 2015 UTC,That's exactly his plan. Are we commenting in parallel realities?
EmDrive,3cvyg5,emdrive_gawker,4,Sat Jul 11 16:36:44 2015 UTC,Just pointing out that annoucing distribution prior to testing is overconfident. I doubt TheTravellerEMD would feel the same way about distributing 6 copies of a device that does not perform as expected.
EmDrive,3cvyg5,Emdrivebeliever,5,Sat Jul 11 16:47:50 2015 UTC,He will do it regardless. Maybe others can find the problem and can improve it. I can't see it any other way than a win-win for all.
EmDrive,3cvyg5,kowdermesiter,3,Sat Jul 11 16:49:37 2015 UTC,"I'm all for increasing the number of EmDrive builds for the purposes of testing including the completion of TheTravellerEMD's build.

EmDrive,3cw4tf,TheTravellerEMD,5,Sat Jul 11 10:11:21 2015 UTC,Thanks for the concern - I'm planning to build an extensive Faraday cage. That's a great idea I think (at least for the first few tests) I could set up cameras and switch it on remotely from outside my garage.
EmDrive,3cw4tf,TheTravellerEMD,5,Sat Jul 11 10:43:20 2015 UTC,"Good luck.   It is a long and difficult journey you have started out on, with many pitfalls and technical challenges you may not yet be aware of.  Not only is the magnetron power supply capable of delivering lethal electrical shocks, the magnetron's microwave output can, if there are any leaks,  cook and/or sterilize and/or blind you in seconds."
EmDrive,3czri0,protasis,7,Sun Jul 12 06:56:36 2015 UTC,"It seems (ignore the rest if I'm wrong) that you think that you modelled the bounces of the microwaves on the sides of the cavity as perfectly elastic (which isn't that bad assuing a high rnough Q) and concluded that there's a net force from adding the vectors on the cavity's walls.  I could prove to you that it's not the case and forces cancel each other, but you said you hate math and in any case there's a very simple experiment to test the theory. There's something else that make perfectly elastic bounces: gas molecules. Simply take a cone, fill it with gas, the more pressure the better, and measure force."

EmDrive,3ctogf,hms11,10,Fri Jul 10 18:11:33 2015 UTC,"There are three threads of discussion on NSF.  One is ""the traveller""'s rants to which for some reason Rodal decided to start responding suddenly. All of that gets my obligatory skip - ""the traveller"" reposts the same stuff over and over and just consumes people's time. WarpTech rants over CoE and CoM get the same treatment from me. Until this can be modeled in some practical way and at least a vague mechanism of how this works can be proposed, any rants on CoE or CoM are completely pointless.  The second thread is on numerical modeling of the EMDrive, as much as those experiments are understood at the moment. The goal of that is to determine what is going on inside in terms of the Poynting vector. This is generally necessary as the prerequisite for determining how the energy is distributed inside and if there is any chance of getting some sort of thrust. My personal money is on the fact that the near-standing waves generated in the oddly-shaped resonant cavity correspond to some massive pseudo-particles, which in turn impart actual momentum on the frustum. In order to estimate whether this is true or not, someone has to calculate the Poynting vector so we can estimate energy of any wave packets if such even get generated, which would allow for calculation of their momentum. Overall, this isn't actually that complicated of a physics problem. The complication comes from the fact that nobody explored in detail this particular cavity shape. However, since we don't know what conditions are actually needed to generate anything of use, this is mostly very preliminary work to get some baseline data for ideal conditions (which may simply prove that with perfect resonance, there is no thrust).  The third thread continues about practical aspects of building some of those things, and I've seen a number of previously lurking people actually come out and volunteer expertise and/or equipment. And of course SeeShells launched the funding campaign."
EmDrive,3ctogf,noctar,10,Sun Jul 12 18:17:34 2015 UTC,"Theories abound. Some are shot down or die quickly some linger on.  ""Q"" is not the same ""Q"" to everyone and never has been.  ""Good Vibrations"" may end up having a whole new meaning soon but schools still out on this theory.  MEEP runs need to include longer simulations to get any real meaningful data from them. Yet pictures from picoseconds (""Blatant Exaggeration"") of data have spawned new possible theories.  TheTraveller and Rodal (""Both"") continue to not be able to stop throwing mud at each other from time to time. That said. I do lean more toward TheTraveller's side on this bickering, my background is >Click For About Me<  TheTraveller is going to allow others to use and/or buy the same build so that the same equipment can be used by many to do testing. This truly is a magnificent idea which I hope others take him up on, that I hope other builders think about as well. Personally, I would have some trust issues about loaning builds out for testing without some serious contract paperwork that could be used to prevent being stiffed by parties abusing the offer.  Shell has used the word ""Panties"" at least two if not three times in posts now in the EM Drive NASA forum. That said. So far she is the only person to post a link there to try to raise 20 thousand U.S dollars for EM Drive testing as well. Maybe it's a marketing ploy? If so, it seems to be working ;-)  ""Note to self"": Drop the idea of saying ""Jockey Shorts"" 50 times in the EM Drive NASA forum with your Paypal link to get 5 U.S. dollars for EM Drive build money Don....All it will do is get you banned by NASA!  deltaMass and WarpTech did their best impersonation of a typical Rodal and TheTraveller Love Fest session.  Many are in the process of getting ready to build now.  I think the more builds the better, to get more hands on data vs. using older incomplete data (""From all prior tests by all parties"") and focus less on theories about that old incomplete data and more on evaluating the newer and hopefully more complete data.  Most likely the bickering will soon be over conflicting suggestions by posters in the EM Drive NASA forum of what each builder should do for their next test when they publish test data. That will easily drown out any of the current personality conflicts which may exist today.  You did say you wanted an ELI5 (""Explain Like I'm 5"") of what's going on lately in the NASA EM Drive forum? Well, that's my ELI5 version and I'm sticking with it, LOL  Don"
EmDrive,3ctogf,TheUberOverLord,3,Sun Jul 12 00:08:35 2015 UTC,Is warptech still pushing his bizarre theory about particles retaining a memory about how much acceleration they've endured?

The insight is useful to people who make decisions, particularly long-term organizational decisions or, in our particular field, family decisions. The insight is used to develop a framework or theory, either a new theory or advancing an existing one. The insight stimulates new, important questions. The methods used to explore the issue are appropriate (for example, data collection and analysis of data). The methods used are applied rigorously and explain why and how the data support the conclusions. Connections to prior work in the field or from other fields are made and serve to make the article's arguments clear.

When the Flight Thruster had passed all their tests in SPR's UK lab, the details plans were sent to Boeing to build and test.   Some time later Boeing said there were no longer working with SPR. They have never said the Flight Thruster did not work.  Further to that I suggested to Eagleworks that they call Boeing and ask to get a loan of their Flight Thruster for testing by Eagleworks.

Those off the shelf components can be supplied by the same suppliers I will use.  That way the 1st stage of testing is using a known good EMDrive with a known measurement system.

EmDrive,3ceo5x,Magnesus,9,Tue Jul 7 15:31:40 2015 UTC,"Sigh.  Clearly from the responses your statements are getting from people (myself included), that paper doesn't remove all doubts.  As many people have attempted to explain to you, the fact that the paper has a table of data doesn't validate that data.  The peer checkers simply agree that the data presented in the table is an accurate representation of the other claims.    There is no such thing as a transitive property of papers/claims."
EmDrive,3ceo5x,DrBagelBites,3,Tue Jul 7 20:19:08 2015 UTC,"Makes sense. People complain about the variation in tests making it impossible to say the effect is verified. This would definitely solve that problem. Do you have a rough estimate of what the total cost for drive, test rig and power supplies would be? Also will it have the option to use magnetron fed coax as an input? I'm concerned the rf generator won't perform as well, would be good if you and others could use both."
EmDrive,3ceo5x,flux_capacitor78,7,Tue Jul 7 11:02:01 2015 UTC,"Hi Q EMDrives can only be driven by narrow band Rf generators.  With a magnetron, the cavity bandwidth must be wide enough to handle the wide range of frequencies a magnetron generates.  Eagleworks measured a typical magnetron https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/1pvcUeWKk9p40x_CUbeSIbuw9hxBvWBInwBRw7KyVhQIcIScpqS5xQfZIxlpodzL6K2_Lg=w1879-h873 and found it had a 60MHz power bandwidth, which means the cavity would need to have a 60MHz bandwidth, which would reduce Q to 41 (2,450,000,000 / 60,000,000) which will flush Force generation down the toilet."
EmDrive,3ceo5x,Sledgecrushr,2,Tue Jul 7 11:11:36 2015 UTC,"IMO, using kitchen magnetrons are a really bad idea as to get all the energy inside the cavity, the cavity bandwidth needs to be wide enough to handle the magnetron frequency spread or lose input power:  https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/1pvcUeWKk9p40x_CUbeSIbuw9hxBvWBInwBRw7KyVhQIcIScpqS5xQfZIxlpodzL6K2_Lg=w1879-h873  60MHz is a wide power bandwidth and to get that inside a EMDrive means the Q or bandwidth of the cavity needs to be approx 41 (2,450,000,000 / 60,000,000). At such a low Q, most of the Force is flushed down the toilet and will only generate significant Force by using massive power input.  Only way to make a really good performing EMDrive is to design for the highest Q, say 100,000, and fit the Rf energy inside the 24.5 kHz (+- 12.25kHz) . That needs a narrow band Rf generator that is frequency adjustable in very fine steps such as the 1kHz to be able to exactly set the frequency in the middle of the cavity bandwidth."
EmDrive,3ceo5x,Sledgecrushr,1 point,Tue Jul 7 11:28:49 2015 UTC,It's definitely a worthwhile route to take; if only to find out if specific thrust torque actually scales up with Q.

We have two microwave power sources for planned experiments:    magnetrons from microwave ovens, which are high-power (700-2000W) but also ""dirty"" (frequency-drifting wide-band spectrum) solid-state WiFi amps, which are a cleaner source but very low power (0.1-20W)   Klystrons are low or high power (depends of the model, from milliwatts to tens of kilowatts) and produce a very clean, highly stable and narrow-band output frequency. So for very high-Q cavities, notably with spherical end plates, why nobody thinks about using a klystron?  Some high-power klystrons are on sale on eBay, mainly from Varian. They should be considered as an alternative to the noisier magnetrons, for high-Q cavities with spherical end plates."

Peer-review only means having experts from the field read the paper for correctness and state their opinion on it. Experts that don't get paid for it, so they often don't invest too much time. Experts that are bound by the editor's guidelines for review and inclusion in the journal, which we don't know.    Table 1 would not be there unless the peer reviewers were certain it was correct, factual and was the truth.   This is evidently wrong. They can only check if the numbers he reports (which are cited from other sources) are the ones found in these references. They probably don't do that. They obviously don't replicate to check these figures. So the figures are at best correctly reported from the test they were derived from, that themselves have not been peer-reviewed and are thus subject to experimental error.   It is now peer review fact and history that the data in Table 1 is factual, which means the EMDrive works as claimed. Done and dusted. No Doubt.

The peer-review process confirms that those results are found in those sources, but this is not an implicit peer-review of those sources. Reviewers only examine the manuscript in question.  However, that's not what disappoints me. Many of us were hoping that Shawyer's paper would contain something that we hadn't seen before; new data from new experiments, something to confirm his claims that a superconducting drive would generate much more thrust.   But it doesn't have that. It just summarises the results from groups like Eagleworks and the Yang lab, which we've already seen and discussed many times."

You have no idea what you are talking about. They don't replicate any experiments to confirm the data published in the paper, so if the original experiments contain experimental error (which is exactly what many people are thinking is happening), peer-review does not eradicate them. They could, at best read the references and find the numbers in them. As the reviewers of the references did not replicate the experiments and also just read what was written in those papers, nobody has ever checked the numbers for correctness by replication. So this table is not confirmed to be true, no matter what you wish for. The whole point of the skepticism at the moment is that the only proper testing was done at NASA, who report much lower thrust.  You make the peers out to be some kind of infallible machines. They are humans, they make mistakes and in that journal, they might not even scrutinize the papers thoroughly, resulting in a lot of bullshit nobody wants to cite being published, resulting in an abysmal impact factor.

We understand that those aren't peer-reviewed and are to be taken with a grain of salt. However, that's okay for a journal like this which focuses on speculation and discussion. Those non-peer-reviewed sources are the best we have, and this paper is saying ""recently there's been some interesting preliminary results from these labs; let us speculate on what an improved EmDrive with higher thrust could do for us"".

What are the main claims of the paper and how significant are they?     Is the paper likely to be one of the five most significant papers published in the discipline this year?     How does the paper stand out from others in its field?     Are the claims novel? If not, which published papers compromise novelty?     Are the claims convincing?

EmDrive,3cf8m0,cjbev,4,Tue Jul 7 13:23:10 2015 UTC,A satellite is the holy grail. For a cube sat powered by an EMdrive we're talking around a cool million bucks to produce and launch it.
EmDrive,3cf8m0,Jigsus,3,Tue Jul 7 13:50:17 2015 UTC,What about a ground based demonstrator - or is there not enough thrust produced?
EmDrive,3cf8m0,Sledgecrushr,9,Tue Jul 7 13:56:06 2015 UTC,I think the first step is to demonstrate without a doubt that the device is actually producing thrust.  After that everything else will fall into place fairly quickly.
EmDrive,3cf8m0,fluxfirefive,6,Tue Jul 7 14:13:28 2015 UTC,"IMHO the way to go is to build a 100 kW version.  There's no arguing with hundreds of N of force.  I think we would be talking on the order of 10's of thousands of $ for that, but the parts are off the shelf."

EmDrive,3cf8m0,Jigsus,3,Tue Jul 7 14:13:22 2015 UTC,It is but you have to understand that it has to be rather big for a cubesat and it needs to have a strong source of power (kW of nuclear or solar). That makes it almost 10 times bigger than your standard cubesat.

EmDrive,3cf8m0,Jigsus,2,Tue Jul 7 21:21:22 2015 UTC,Exactly so it will cost a lot of money

It doesn't have to be practical, just proof of concept (can reentry be measurably delayed is good enough) so the sat builders put their money into developing it further."
EmDrive,3cf8m0,Jigsus,3,Tue Jul 7 20:45:08 2015 UTC,The predicted thrust for a baby sized model would be less than the atmospheric drag at the altitude that most sats deploy. So we need to put a full sized one.
EmDrive,3cf8m0,Forlarren,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:26:51 2015 UTC,"The predicted thrust for a baby sized model would be less than the atmospheric drag at the altitude that most sats deploy.   Doesn't matter if it's over a long enough period, tiny variations add up. Heck you could fly a twin in tandem as a control so they would be experiencing the same atmospheric effects.  It also depends on the kind of orbit you are in. Certain orbital periods translate into more delta V than others.  Also LEO isn't the only slot available for cube sats. Being a tertiary payload the price isn't that much different, is more about getting a seat, and those keep becoming more and more available (though the market is growing to meet demand)."
EmDrive,3cf8m0,Jigsus,2,Tue Jul 7 21:36:42 2015 UTC,If the thrust is lower than the drag it will just crash
EmDrive,3cf8m0,ImAClimateScientist,3,Tue Jul 7 21:46:28 2015 UTC,"The best you can do right now with a CubeSat is about 100W peak, 50W OAP using the MMA HaWK. So, the thrust would indeed be pretty tiny, even if the EmDrive works as suggested. One idea would be to mount two Baby EmDrives and two antennae in opposing directions at either end of a 6U cubesat in GEO and look for spin based on doppler shift.   The better space testbed would probably be the ISS. I know that the experiment payloads on the JEM-EF could in theory draw up to 6kW."

Which seems pretty good?  Math, Spr thrust is 330mN/kw @ 50 watts thats .0165 N of thrust.   At 10 Kg that's .00000165 km/s2 acceleration  Going from an orbit of 35786 km to 36786 km using Hofmann to get delta v  Delta v is .0229 km/s  DeltaV/a= t  T=3.857 hours"

EmDrive,3cf6fi,sorrge,1 point,Tue Jul 7 17:37:52 2015 UTC,"Horn antenna:       A horn antenna or microwave horn is an antenna that consists of a flaring metal waveguide shaped like a horn to direct radio waves in a beam. Horns are widely used as antennas at UHF and microwave frequencies, above 300 MHz.  They are used as feeders (called feed horns) for larger antenna structures such as parabolic antennas, as standard calibration antennas to measure the gain of other antennas, and as directive antennas for such devices as radar guns, automatic door openers, and microwave radiometers.  Their advantages are moderate directivity, low standing wave ratio (SWR), broad bandwidth, and simple construction and adjustment.   One of the first horn antennas was constructed in 1897 by Indian radio researcher Jagadish Chandra Bose in his pioneering experiments with microwaves.   In the 1930s the first experimental research (Southworth and Barrow, 1936) and theoretical analysis (Barrow and Chu, 1939) of horns as antennas was done.  The development of radar in World War 2 stimulated horn research to design feed horns for radar antennas. The corrugated horn invented by Kay in 1962 has become widely used as a feed horn for microwave antennas such as satellite dishes and radio telescopes.     Image i - Pyramidal microwave horn antenna, with a bandwidth of 0.8 to 18 GHz. A coaxial cable feedline attaches to the connector visible at top. This type is called a ridged horn; the curving fins visible inside the mouth of the horn increase the antenna's bandwidth.

EmDrive,3cf6fi,Jigsus,1 point,Tue Jul 7 19:05:52 2015 UTC,"sigh... I just keep having to debunk this one. Here's how he came up with the Emdrive concept:   But what if you could amplify the effect? That's exactly the idea that Shawyer stumbled on in the 1970S while working for a British military technology company called Sperry Gyroscope. Shawyer's expertise is in microwaves, and when he was asked to come up with a gyroscopic device for a guidance system he instead came up with the idea for an electromagnetic engine. He even unearthed a 1950S paper by Alex Cullen, an electrical engineer at University College London, describing how electromagnetic energy might create a force. ""It came to nothing at the time, but the idea stuck in my head,"" he says.   That's from the 2006 New Scientist article.  Here's the full text of the article."
EmDrive,3cf6fi,sorrge,2,Tue Jul 7 19:49:16 2015 UTC,I'm sorry but that's not a debunking. It says nothing as to what gave him the inspiration. Granted I just read what I said around here but it's not really that important to warrant a citation.

For example, if he first developed some theory, then made the experiment, it would reinforce that theory quite a lot. On the other hand, if he tried to replicate an unexplained phenomenon with his device, as you suggested, then a) his theory is not so important anymore, b) perhaps we should study the satellites which go out of their orbit, instead of trying to replicate the effect on Earth.  That would make much more sense, since these satellites would be working prototypes for the EmDrive. If it will be found that their movement is in fact completely normal, this would invalidate the original concept of EmDrive, which is a bad sign. If the anomaly on the satellites will be confirmed, we suddenly have a lot of experimental confirmations of the effect."
EmDrive,3cf6fi,fluxfirefive,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:37:06 2015 UTC,"We are still probably talking about minuscule amounts of thrust and different designs, I could imagine if this effect got unnoticed. A tripod is a fairly stable structure, not likely that a tiny fraction of a N makes any difference. Satellites could have many different antenna designs with different parameters that could make the thrust effect go away.   I'd just keep an open eye on this. Maybe somebody will build an experiment."
EmDrive,3cf6fi,fluxfirefive,2,Tue Jul 7 13:46:25 2015 UTC,"Also satellites would be well under 1 kW, putting the force at best in uN range.  This guy's argument is bunk."
EmDrive,3cf6fi,ummwut,4,Tue Jul 7 16:20:02 2015 UTC,Micronewtons have relatively enormous affects on satellites in orbit. YOUR argument is bunk. Radiation pressure from a directional antenna is like femto or attonewtons.

How much radiation pressure do satellites experience?  If you could quantify these things, then we could put this argument to rest right now.  You are the one who created this post and trying to convince people.  Why don't you produce some numbers and source(s)?"
EmDrive,3cf6fi,fluxfirefive,3,Tue Jul 7 17:06:05 2015 UTC,"Emissive radiation pressure is ignored while working with satellite-based radio transmitters. I'm not going to do the math to prove this. It's a known phenomenon, but it's very, very small.   Atmospheric drag isn't exactly relevant here, so I'm not sure why you brought it up.  Solar radiation pressure is not always ignored.

Atmospheric drag does in fact act on satellites as well source.  From wikipedia:   or bodies in a low Earth orbit, the most significant effect is the atmospheric drag."
EmDrive,3cf6fi,fluxfirefive,3,Tue Jul 7 17:25:26 2015 UTC,"So, solar radiation pressure alone is on the same magnitude as the force we might expect from our transmitter,   No, it's not.

EmDrive,3cf6fi,Eric1600,1 point,Tue Jul 7 17:28:05 2015 UTC,"No, it's not. That's what I'm saying. The force from a transmitter is negligible.   The cross-section of a satellite is on the order of square meters, so the force from solar radiation pressure is on the order of 10's of uN which is what we would expect from an em drive operating on the order of 10's of watts.   OBVIOUSLY this is the case. It's not relevant in discussion of radiation pressure.   How is the most significant force acting on a satellite not relevant to a discussion of forces acting a satellites?"
EmDrive,3cf6fi,fluxfirefive,3,Tue Jul 7 17:35:26 2015 UTC,Depends on the Q of the resonator and probably a few other speculative things that are not yet proven.  However a micro-force probably would have been noticed over the course of many years because the antennas are setup to face one direction all the time.

EmDrive,3cf6fi,fluxfirefive,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:44:47 2015 UTC,"Yea, they point at the earth so the tiny force would actually aid in station keeping.  If this is happening, I'm sure it's not noticed, as it's lost in the noise.  The force would be acting against the decay of orbit and would be much less significant.  Also, an em drive is not just any old microwave cavity / horn, they are finely designed and tuned for thrust."
EmDrive,3cf6fi,wallofwolfstreet,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:38:49 2015 UTC,I think they would notice it as their long term orbital decays would be off.  In addition we have several multi-decade probes that would have unknown course/velocity errors.

A non-zero Poynting vector is definitely possible in this case.  In fact, in my original comment on it I said that a Poynting vector from the end of the cavity that contained the antenna to the other end was even rather intuitive, since that would be the flux of power when considering absorption at the walls.  It's not that I don't think a net Poynting vector is possible, or that the simulation was in error; I just know that the Poynting vector has little significance in this case, and getting all excited about it is bizarre.    What I meant with the comment is that if MEEP did show thrust, I would sooner believe that MEEP had made an error than believe it had predicted propellantless thrust."
EmDrive,3cay7v,Zouden,4,Mon Jul 6 15:15:16 2015 UTC,"It also is unclear to me what the mesh grid size is for this simulation.  Apparently Rodal is also concerned about the grid placement.  I agree the poynting vector is mostly just a mathmatical tool, it doesn't have much physical significance.  At least none that I can see.  The poynting might need to be non-zero due to the resistivity of the surface conductors.  I don't know what boundry conditions they are setting up for meep, but this would play a critical role in any simulation results they are trying to analyze especially looking at differences between each iteration."

Since these can be viewed as being made of millions of coupled moving parts (such as atoms), they can have millions of resonant frequencies. The vibrations inside them travel as waves, at an approximately constant velocity, bouncing back and forth between the sides of the resonator."
EmDrive,3cay7v,See-Shell,2,Mon Jul 6 18:02:34 2015 UTC,"The article on resonators says:   A cavity resonator is a hollow closed conductor such as a metal box or a cavity within a metal block, containing electromagnetic waves (radio waves) reflecting back and forth between the cavity's walls. When a source of radio waves at one of the cavity's resonant frequencies is applied, the oppositely-moving waves form standing waves, and the cavity stores electromagnetic energy.   Surely standing waves won't form if there's a great big hole in the side?"
EmDrive,3cay7v,See-Shell,4,Mon Jul 6 18:08:27 2015 UTC,"A cavity resonator is closed, yes. But an open waveguide can resonate. All you need to form standing waves is waves being reflected at each other.  If you have your source at the closed end, wouldn't some standing waves form (however brief in nature) along the length of a tube as the waves bounce from side to side? Obviously its less Q than in the closed cavity, but again, Q doesn't seem very important in the latest iterations of Todd's theory.  /u/rfmwguy would be able to explain it very well to us.  If he's not too busy finalizing his experiment."
EmDrive,3cay7v,Zouden,5,Mon Jul 6 18:31:44 2015 UTC,"Back from short vacation...still developing my own theories, but a horn can have a low vswr or standing waves. What these experiments are trying to prove I think is that microwave radiation acts differently than light and imparts a higher force. If u look at a maser and laser, energy is built up and released in bursts. Both pack a punch on a target...far more than it would be if it were an open ended emitter like a horn. I don't know if it works, which is why I'm experimenting on my own. I've seen rf do remarkable things...maybe there's another trick up her sleeve...p.s. build resumes tomorrow, going straight for magnetron. Wish me luck. Btw, love the frustum turns summaries."
EmDrive,3cay7v,See-Shell,2,Tue Jul 7 00:58:01 2015 UTC,Wish me luck.   Best of luck! ;-) Looking forward to seeing your results...
EmDrive,3cay7v,Zouden,2,Tue Jul 7 09:23:22 2015 UTC,"For those that don't realize this, microwaves and audible sound waves have similar wavelength.  2.4 GHz microwaves have a wavelength of 0.125m which is equal to 2.7456 kHz sound wave in air at 20C.  That's why microwave wave guides are similar scale and shape to audio wave guides.  To understand how an electromagnetic wave can reflect off of an open hoop you kinda have to have a basic understanding of electrical induction though."
EmDrive,3cay7v,See-Shell,4,Mon Jul 6 19:12:04 2015 UTC,"I can't stay long as I have a beautiful composit 12 foot beam to go get. No, you can have Q in an opened cavity, if you didn't horns would be a little wimpy meep meeps."
EmDrive,3cay7v,andygood,2,Mon Jul 6 17:27:31 2015 UTC,"Sound as well as Rf and light, even gravity are comprised of wave functions.  In a cavity the waves can be either constructive or destructive. Has anyone taken a paper towel tube and growled into one end to the scare the dog (or cat) and heard the amplified sound and tone resonating out of it?  Pretty much the same analogy as RF."
EmDrive,3cay7v,See-Shell,3,Mon Jul 6 17:35:36 2015 UTC,"I see, so it would have some resonance, but as the photons are still escaping it would have lower Q compared to a sealed cavity."
EmDrive,3cay7v,LoreChano,7,Mon Jul 6 17:40:16 2015 UTC,"Here I would agree with warptech. If you look at the Chinese tests with their cavity size it resonates at a calculated 2.46GHz with a harmonic Q of ~80,000, injected with a 2.45GHz signal. The antenna placement (waveguide) insertion point was calculated and tested at the small end and the large end and resulted of a Q difference of 60,000, only 20k at the small end. But they have had the highest reported thrust, hmmm?  There is nothing wrong with a high Q but remember you need to do something with that stored energy that's in the standing modes. notsosureofit in his theory http://emdrive.wiki/@notsosureofit_Hypothesis shows a nice chart at the bottom of his page that's is a great clue as to how Q isn't everything but what you do with it, when and in which direction in the cavity.   Got my beam of 12 foot composite laminated wood for my fulcrum. I'm using wood because it's a good vibrational damper and has a low thermal expansion coefficient, plus can be made very rigid with whats called a kingpost block with cabling to the ends tightened by turn buckles. I'll be shining a laser down the beam to make sure the turn buckles are adjusted and keep the beam straight along it's length."

EmDrive,3cbdig,Zouden,1 point,Mon Jul 6 19:49:27 2015 UTC,"theme is great and i like the addition of the new mods! Quick question from the sidebar:   ""experimentally confirmed EmDrive thrust anomaly""    a little confused by this, but that may be because I am a word person. Is it agreed that the thrust anomaly has been experimentally confirmed? Isn't experimental confirmation of the thrust anomaly something EW and awesome people like /u/see-shell are currently working on? Wouldn't experimental confirmation of the thrust anomaly mean discussions and experiments concerning theories of how that thrust is working/happening... not more experiments to discern if a thrust anomaly is happening at all? I guess my question is, is it alright to state that something has been experimentally confirmed when serious doubts of measurement validity remain?"
EmDrive,3cbdig,See-Shell,6,Wed Jul 8 20:31:17 2015 UTC,"Good question! The way I look at it, the experiments have confirmed that there is a ""thrust anomaly"" - thrust was observed, and the source isn't understood."
EmDrive,3cbdig,ReisGuy,3,Wed Jul 8 21:20:01 2015 UTC,"Some consider it this like. You're sitting in your car, stopped. You reach up and push on the windshield and the car moves very, very, slowly forward. That's an anomaly. It shouldn't be happening but it is. One of Newton's laws states for every action there is a reaction. The EMDrive doesn't seem to act like a normal rocket shoving propellant out and seeing a reaction to push the rocket up and away. We're not sure why microwaves in a can of a different shape, enclosed with no way out should show thrust like a rocket (much smaller thrust BTW) but there is data to say it does.  Plenty of physicists and engineers and lay people are scratching their heads postulating theories, building similar first generation devices to solve this seemingly unsolvable puzzle, but knowing humanity we will not let Newtonian laws get in the way to discovering the what and why."
EmDrive,3cbdig,Henator,3,Wed Jul 8 21:10:37 2015 UTC,"I quite like the wording, to be honest. It's pretty neutral in its tone, while still accepting of the outcome of the studies.  ""...the experimentally confirmed EmDrive thrust anomaly, and theories about how the anomaly arises through either measurement error or genuine reactionless thrust"".  Several studies have confirmed thrust that shouldn't be there according to classical physics.   Either there was a measurement error or there is reaction-less thrust.  Do you have any other suggestions for how it should be worded? Are those not the only two explanations?"
EmDrive,3c8ga0,splad,5,Sun Jul 5 21:48:45 2015 UTC,"Create a negative of the wave to erase it, then create another wave going in the required direction."
EmDrive,3c8ga0,sorrge,5,Sun Jul 5 22:02:43 2015 UTC,"This would work with waves in a straight line - in one-dimensional space (like a wave in a piece of string, or electrical waves through a wire). As soon as we move to two or three dimensional space, where the waveform propagates not just forward, but outwards too, this runs into an enormous number of problems.  For example: This would be difficult to accomplish on a wave that is propagating on the surface of water, because that wave is radially expanding from a point (or an area). If the hypothetical wave-tool being used here is also a point-source and if it cannot essentially create a gigantic arc to envelop a significant portion of the approaching wave, it will only create an interference pattern which will cause some havoc in the area where both waves intersect, but both waves will essentially pass right through each other and continue on in their respective directions.  The waves do not lose much energy in interacting with each other.  Visual Example  [EDIT: NOR do they refract when encountering interference, standing waves, or any other kind of wave]   In three-dimensional space (like the shockwave of an explosion), the same problem is compounded even further becasue then there would have to be an entire section of a sphere in your vicinity that would conform perfectly to the shape of the explosive wave as it approaches and release an inverse wave with a finely tuned amplitude and frequency to perfectly cancel out the oncoming wave.   BUT WAIT! There's more! :D   the movement of the new wave-creating arc (or sphere-section) will create a wave on the back of the arc too (unless that is suddenly a vacuum or a damped enough surface (like a sandy beach) which will stop the propagation of the wave backwards. Remember folks! Every point where the arc touches the water (or whatever medium of propagation the wave is travelling through - earth for earthquakes, air for shockwaves/sound) becomes the origin point for another wave... in all directions. Basically, when your oars strike still water and push it in one direction (as a wave), they are simultaneously creating an inverse-wave on their opposite face. both waves will continue outwards in opposite directions. So I wouldn't want to be standing behind the sphere-segment that is going to blast out an inverse-wave to cancel out an explosion's shockwave either (because they'll both do pretty-much the same amount of damage to me)  Final note: In media where density changes with temperature (most fluids - including gases), a density change at an angle to the approaching wave can refract or even reflect the wave. So that might work, but you're not really creating waves there.  TL;DR - Unless you have a dampening or reflective medium which can absorb or deflect a wave, that wave is gonna go on its merry way, cuz fuck you it's a wave."
EmDrive,3c8ga0,fsm_vs_cthulhu,2,Mon Jul 6 09:16:08 2015 UTC,"Sure, it's not realistic. But there are no additional restrictions in the OP, ""You can create waves in any direction or shape, and the waves you create can be as big or as small as you like""."
EmDrive,3c8ga0,sorrge,2,Mon Jul 6 10:29:19 2015 UTC,"I also didn't make it clear that I'm interested in diverting the course of a wave front, which is very different from diverting an entire wave. In 2d space, a wave propagates in a circle so to cancel it I think you need to be at the source.  I'm mostly interested in the possibility that waves in a medium might be able to change the propagation speed of other waves in that medium."
EmDrive,3c8ga0,fsm_vs_cthulhu,3,Mon Jul 6 11:01:41 2015 UTC,"Hmmm. You are absolutely right about having to be at the source to have the most chance of cancelling it.   But diverting a wave needs a change in density of the medium. I don't know if that can be accomplished by a large amplitude, long wavelength wave... you could theoretically tune it to vary the density in sync with an approaching wavefront? I have no idea how well that would work though.  It would be kind of like how an explosion shockwave changes (refracts) the path of the light passing through the air a little, by creating a highly dense area of air at the wavefront."
EmDrive,3c8ga0,MrMOSFET,2,Mon Jul 6 11:19:59 2015 UTC,I still think an array of point sources could serve a similar role as oscillating dipoles in a dielectric medium.

EmDrive,3c8ga0,SlangFreak,2,Mon Jul 6 18:39:56 2015 UTC,"Yup. This seems like the only thing you can do. If you allow for reflection off of and refraction around objects, then there are more ways to manipulate the direction of the wave."

EmDrive,3c8ga0,fsm_vs_cthulhu,5,Mon Jul 6 06:46:35 2015 UTC,"[edit]: Just wanted to make it clear that I'm not trying to ""point out"" anything. Just tossing around ideas that might start interesting discussions.  I have this idea that all matter is just transient energy of a single field. In other words, vibrations of some sort. My theory (by mine I mean what is in my head as many of these ideas are not mine originally) is that acceleration of matter is simply a rotation of waves propagating in a time-like direction to waves propagating in a space-like direction.  Clearly gravity then is a density gradient akin to that found in a dielectric medium which bends the paths of not only light (waves propagating in a space-like direction) but also matter (waves propagating in a time-like direction)  So my question is, does the EmDrive create gravity? Do resonance and standing waves somehow change the dielectric properties of my imaginary energy sea in a way that doesn't require actual energy density?  I guess the point of my thought experiment was to help me try to wrap my head around my own ideas. I think water is a terrible example to work with and overall I'd rate my question as a D+."
EmDrive,3c8ga0,fsm_vs_cthulhu,5,Mon Jul 6 09:33:20 2015 UTC,"This sounds very similar to something I've heard before. I believe related to string theory. That all matter is essentially some kind of interference pattern in a multi-dimensional universe of invisible 'strings'. Haven't heard about the gravity bit though. Very interesting, bringing that up in connection to the EmDrive. I have no idea how plausible that is, but I like the thought! :)"
EmDrive,3c8ga0,Eric1600,3,Mon Jul 6 09:38:58 2015 UTC,Well a lot of these ideas come to me from the photon theory of matter I.E. the theory that we don't need anything other than electromagnetic waves to describe all matter. As seen on this website from the 90's  Since I'm an armchair theorist who sucks at math I prefer to read a lot of ideas from different fields and try to get them to fit together into a big picture in my head. Lately a lot of that picture has been becoming more clear and I owe a lot of it to the EmDrive subreddit and the NSF forums.
EmDrive,3c8ga0,Eric1600,2,Mon Jul 6 09:51:18 2015 UTC,"Very interesting! :) In the case of this specific question however, I will still say (as my detailed comment stated) that two waves in the same medium (except for one-dimensional media) will have a very hard time cancelling each other out."
EmDrive,3c8ga0,Deeviant,1 point,Mon Jul 6 10:01:07 2015 UTC,I never wanted them to cancel. I think that answer missed the intention of my thought experiment and I agree that they would not cancel unless you created an anti-wave at the source location of the initial wave.

I really hate particles personally, seems like the chemistry equivalent of epicycles. I accept that there exists quantized behaviors, and I'm trying to settle on my favorite explanation for that. I've simply chosen to approach it starting with the assumption of waves instead of starting with the assumption of particles."
EmDrive,3c8ga0,MrMOSFET,2,Mon Jul 6 20:16:41 2015 UTC,"Well there really is no such thing as particles or waves.  String theory at its fundamental level has no particles.  Particles arise from the vibrations of the strings.  If string theory is correct, the electron is not really a point, but a tiny loop of string. A string can do something aside from moving--- it can oscillate like your wave idea in different ways. If it oscillates a certain way, then from a distance, unable to tell it is really a string, we see an electron. But if it oscillates some other way, well, then we call it a photon, or a quark....etc."

EmDrive,3c73ir,daronjay,9,Mon Jul 6 05:03:31 2015 UTC,OK so you need to clean your power before you run it through your equipment.  This is actually very simple to do.  Go down to your local electronics store and purchase an uninterruptable power supply (UPS).  A UPS will take your ac voltage and turn it into DC voltage which then charges a batter and that DC voltage gets rectified back to AC voltage for super clean power.  This I think might help out quite a bit in getting rid of those anomalous power bumps in your system.
EmDrive,3c73ir,Sledgecrushr,10,Sun Jul 5 17:21:36 2015 UTC,"Pretty sure most UPS use a switching inverter which produce square wave AC, which is very dirty, as it's full of harmonics."
EmDrive,3c73ir,fluxfirefive,11,Sun Jul 5 19:54:26 2015 UTC,You are absolutely right about that.  You want to get a line interactive UPS that conditions your power so that you have a controlled and clean output power.  Some reading on UPS systems. http://www.apcdistributors.com/white-papers/Power/WP-79%20Technical%20Comparison%20of%20On-line%20vs.%20Line-interactive%20UPS%20designs.pdf
EmDrive,3c73ir,Sledgecrushr,5,Sun Jul 5 20:12:41 2015 UTC,"Interesting, thanks.  Another approach might be to use a signal generator (sin wave) -> audio frequency amplifier -> step-up transformer.  As long as the s/n is good on the amplifier and the step-up transformer is not saturating this should make really clean AC."
EmDrive,3c73ir,fluxfirefive,3,Sun Jul 5 21:18:56 2015 UTC,It doesnt really have to be a step up transformer for it to clean your ac power.  An autotransformer 120-120 would be pretty close to perfect but its not conditioning the power just kind of knocking off some of the rough edges.  What you really want is a power conditioning system https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_conditioner that will create a near perfect cycle every time.
EmDrive,3c73ir,Sledgecrushr,2,Sun Jul 5 22:51:24 2015 UTC,"Power conditioner:       A power conditioner (also known as a line conditioner or power line conditioner) is a device intended to improve the quality of the power that is delivered to electrical load equipment. While there is no official definition of a power conditioner, the term most often refers to a device that acts in one or more ways to deliver a voltage of the proper level and characteristics to enable load equipment to function properly. In some uses, power conditioner refers to a voltage regulator with at least one other function to improve power quality (e.g. power factor correction, noise suppression, transient impulse protection, etc.)     Relevant: Rob Arnold | Sharp Solar | Rush equipment   Parent commenter can toggle NSFW or delete.

EmDrive,3c73ir,autowikibot,2,Sun Jul 5 22:52:24 2015 UTC,"The step-up transformer is just to get the impedance up so you could get 120v.  The auto in autotransformer just refers to a transformer that has its primary and secondary connected together in series, so when I said ""step-up"" transformer that includes step-up autotransformer.  I'm not trying to say there is anything wrong with your approach.  It's just that ""power conditioner"" is a very broad term, and often power conditioners are switching voltage regulators that keep a consistent AC voltage, but introduced a lot of noise which would be counterproductive here.  Appliances don't really care how clean AC power is just how consistent the voltage is, so often power conditioners are designed with lots of voltage regulation, but not much filtering.  An audio frequency amplifier's power supply is both heavily regulated and filtered."
EmDrive,3c73ir,fluxfirefive,1 point,Sun Jul 5 23:14:47 2015 UTC,Ive never messed with an audio receivers power supply.  Wouldnt that power supply drop your voltage down to about 24v?  Excactly why you would need the boost transformer.   If you cannibalisine your own stereo systems power supply the boost transformer should be pretty cheap considering the small amounts of power thats running through it.  This would work really well.
EmDrive,3c73ir,Sledgecrushr,1 point,Sun Jul 5 23:33:06 2015 UTC,"Yes, that's why you need the step-up transformer.  The system I'm describing has no battery; it's getting its power from the wall, but taking advantage of the very good filtering and voltage regulation built into most audio frequency amplifiers.  I'm only trying to offer an additional option, as I think finding a power inverter / conditioner that outputs clean enough AC for scientific research would be very difficult and expensive.  Whereas the system I'm describing could be put together very cheaply.  The limitation of this system is the power output is limited to hundreds (maybe thousands) of watts.  edit: Another issue that needs to be addressed is what is being plugged into our clean AC.  If it's a diode rectifier, then there is going to be tons of noise no matter how clean our AC is.  edit2: FYI: I've used this method a lot, not to clean wall power, but to make high voltage ac that I can control the frequency and voltage of.  I have a decent tektronix signal generator connected to your every day home theatre receiver connected to a big step-up transformer.  It works really well, just DON'T TRY TO DRIVE IT WITH YOUR COMPUTER'S SOUND CARD, as the s/n is terrible.  Use a good signal generator."

EmDrive,3c73ir,Sledgecrushr,2,Mon Jul 6 03:03:54 2015 UTC,"Yea, the goal was not clean power specifically, but the power did look clean on the o-scope.  And I think by its very nature it would be much cleaner than the line."
EmDrive,3c73ir,fluxfirefive,1 point,Mon Jul 6 03:58:56 2015 UTC,"Maybe they should try one of these.  BestBuy seems to think they work.  Also they told me they really need to use gold-plated cables.     Side Note: I actually have about a dozen of these fancy power cleaning & filtering surge protectors that I got free from a friend at an AV testing lab.  I'd be happy to send one to a builder if they actually thought it would help. But as far as I know, its not better than a regular surge protector."
EmDrive,3c73ir,bitofaknowitall,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:43:33 2015 UTC,"I think the idea is to do two things with your power.  First you need to instantly filter out any spikes in electricity before it goes through your electronics system.  This means the top of your sine waves on an oscilloscope would always remain constant, and I believe that a surge protector would definitely help with very large surges that could harm most electronics.  Secondly you would need a capacitor system to fill in low spots in your electricity.  Basically energy needs to be reintroduced back into the system at the right frequency.  This is pretty much what a power conditioning setup does.  Incoming power is both dampened and boosted on a per cycle basis so that you get relatively perfect quality electricity."
EmDrive,3c73ir,Sledgecrushr,2,Mon Jul 6 19:43:11 2015 UTC,What about three-phase power? Wouldn't that help even out some anomalies as well?

I didn't look at their setup or what they are doing, but in general in the lab if you need to power something that is ultra sensitive you use    DC Power supply (lab grade supplies are very clean).  Example   or    A battery.   Sometimes you need multiple sources in order to isolate a noisy DC system from another more sensitive DC system."

This story has also been going on for decades, some devices have been built which are claimed to produce thrust (also barely above the noise level). It has even some theory behind it, and this theory was developed and published before the experiments began."
EmDrive,3c6w6y,SmokeMathHeilSatin,4,Sun Jul 5 12:36:02 2015 UTC,"i consider the woodward effect to be the leading candidate theory for explaining how the EMdrive works.  the similarities between the two are hard to ignore, and recent experimental evidence strongly implies they are connected."
EmDrive,3c6w6y,Zouden,5,Mon Jul 6 09:59:57 2015 UTC,"It certainly looks like the EmDrive is a Mach Effect Thruster but does it actually operate using the Woodward effect? That effect comes from altering the energy of a vibrating object, like Woodward's piezo-capacitor, which seems quite different to the EmDrive's asymmetric microwave cavity.  On the other hand, Shawyer does say that the EmDrive needs to vibrate to work... and the microwave cavity in Guido Fetta's Cannae drive is symmetrical. What if we just need to take a microwave cavity and vibrate it? Perhaps the EmDrive is just a larger version of the Woodward device?"
EmDrive,3c6w6y,SmokeMathHeilSatin,2,Mon Jul 6 11:14:06 2015 UTC,"as for vibration, i think the electrons moving back and forth between the big and small ends of the cavity should have some effect, but it would be orders of magnitude weaker than the effect of properly vibrating the EMdrive to make it function as a Woodward Effect thruster.  if the EMdrive really does operate via Mach-Effects it could also explain why different groups are getting such different results, efforts to reduce vibrations may be reducing thrust. in that case, all of the researchers working on it up to this point have been working with one hand tied behind their backs.  i think running a Woodward Effect test should be very high on the priorities list for researchers working on the EMdrive. if the theory is true, the first group to confirm it will make history.  it would be interesting to see what /u/TheTravellerEMD thinks of this."
EmDrive,3c6w6y,Zouden,7,Thu Jul 9 09:27:39 2015 UTC,"I remember this article from before I heard about the emdrive. It's an interesting story and it's very well-written.  I noticed this part:   This doesn't violate Newton's Third Law; it simply adjusts the consequences by varying inertial mass. Nor does it violate the principle of conservation of energy, because the system requires power for its operation. It could acquire that power from solar panels or a small onboard nuclear reactor.    It seems the author isn't aware of the ""kinetic energy problem"". I wonder what Woodward thinks about it.  edit: thinking about it some more... the energy going into the Woodward device serves only to vary the mass, and not provide thrust. Thrust comes as a reaction to the mass change per Newton's third law. This is exactly the same as the MiHsC explanation for the EmDrive (only it varies mass instead of inertia). Perhaps the Woodward device is another way of tapping into the zero-point field."
EmDrive,3c6w6y,fluxfirefive,6,Sun Jul 5 13:54:22 2015 UTC,"""kinetic energy problem""   LOL, I think we should start calling this ""Shawyer's Dilemma"""
EmDrive,3c6w6y,ervza,4,Mon Jul 6 01:52:51 2015 UTC,"I wonder if an em drive might be using the Woodward effect in some way. The recent work with net Poynting Vectors.  It has been shown that you need a continues RF source that somehow interacts with the standing wave to cause a net Poynting Vector.  Lets consider the standing wave in an EM drive to be our moving mass that we want to change the inertia of.  Would it be possible for your RF source to interfere with the standing wave in such a way, that the backwards moving waves are given greater amplitude, and therefor greater mass, and the forward moving waves have a smaller amplitude and mass?"
EmDrive,3c6w6y,smckenzie23,1 point,Sun Jul 5 20:15:42 2015 UTC,"If I understand the Woodward effect (and I probably don't), thrust can't push you beyond the speed at which you cycle the fluctuating mass back and forth. Right?"
EmDrive,3c6w6y,Zouden,5,Sun Jul 5 14:04:52 2015 UTC,"Surely the speed of those vibrations would determine the magnitude of thrust, but not the top speed."
EmDrive,3c6w6y,squeezeonein,2,Sun Jul 5 14:19:13 2015 UTC,"I think so but the speed as you call it does not refer to the cycles per second of the device but to the distance travelled of the fluctuating mass. ie. the wavelength not the frequency. If the radius of the device is increased the wavelength will increase which will increase the thrust but the cycles per second will not. Also the fluctuating mass is miniscule compared to the static mass of the device so the thrust would be decreased proportionately. edit, the device should not be limited to a constant sublight speed so long as acceleration remains constant, although at a certain rpm centrifugal forces would tear it apart."
EmDrive,3c6w6y,Rowenstin,1 point,Sun Jul 5 23:13:55 2015 UTC,"Well, there's no problem because it's not a closed system. The energy of the variable mass part comes from and goes outside."
EmDrive,3c6w6y,Zouden,5,Sun Jul 5 14:06:25 2015 UTC,"I don't really get what you're saying... I mean a battery-powered spacecraft is a closed system, and if it accelerates, that energy has to come from somewhere."
EmDrive,3c6w6y,Rowenstin,1 point,Sun Jul 5 14:12:05 2015 UTC,"First disclaimer, this is very evident and I don't suppose the guy in the artice has not thought on it (though given recent events, I'm not so sure any more). So think on this as something that puzzles me about the effect, rather than a disproof.   Let's go to the diagram in the article explaining the effect. Let's have a closed system of two masses, initially together, that are separated. Then we make the mass to the right, let's call it M1 vibrate (or communicate energy by any other means), so it acquires mass because of relativistic effects, and pull the two masses together. Given that the mass to the right is now larger, the center of mass should be now to the right of it's initial point and the device moved on it's own apparently breaking CoM.  But wait. Where did the energy come from? It cant come from M1. All energy is equivalent: if we convert chemical or nuclear energy into vibration or whatever you have, E=mc2 gives us the same mass. It can't come from outside the device, since we assumed a closed system.  So the only option we have is to transfer some mass/energy from the mass to the right (let's call it M2) to M1. If energy has inertia, this transfer process should move the device to the left by an amount that would cancel the amount that the cycle was supposed to make it gain. No actual movement.  Why does that experiment in the vacuum chamber work? Because it's not a closed system. Energy comes from outside, is using the planet as a reaction mass. I'm speculating a bit here, but a ship that used solar energy to power this drive would be using the radiation as a reaction mass, much like a solar sail."
EmDrive,3c6w6y,Zouden,4,Sun Jul 5 16:18:55 2015 UTC,"Hmm, actually according to Mach's Principle it's never a closed system; all masses exert a force on every other mass and if we can manipulate that influence, we can ""trick"" the universe into doing work for us.  Mach Effect Thrusters like the Woodward device would not work in an empty universe. But it works in ours :D"
EmDrive,3c6w6y,daronjay,3,Sun Jul 5 16:25:56 2015 UTC,"His theory is based on ""explicitly non-local interaction involving the most distant matter in the universe"", which is a convenient way to escape the conservation laws.

EmDrive,3c6w6y,api,3,Mon Jul 6 05:12:55 2015 UTC,"One of the things that tempers my skepticism about the EmDrive and other similar things is this:  This is not the first time an electromagnetic device incorporating ""asymmetry"" of some sort or another has shown what seems to be a weak anomalous thrust effect.  These effects are always at the edge of detection, provoking justifiable skepticism, but they also don't clearly not work. Also unlike certain other fringe science claims of which I am more skeptical, the designs for these systems are published in the open literature and in many cases there have been claimed replications both amateur and professional.  Something seems to be happening, and it's almost definitely one of two things: a measurement or experimental construction artifact that is very hard to rule out even for professionals with good equipment and that happens to more than one experimenter with more than one experimental construction... or actual anomalous thrust not explained by present theory. (The openness of the experiments pretty decisively rules out fraud, unlike e.g. some ""cold fusion"" claims.)  The EmDrive is interesting because it seems like a system that is simple enough and replicable enough that we might finally get a definitive yes or no. If it's a yes, it's a really huge deal. If it's a no, it might still teach us something really valuable about how to measure things like this and construct experiments in this area. A very well written and thorough 'no' paper could be an important advancement in the meta-science of experiment construction.  If there is a here here, it's likely that the same physical effect is responsible for all these devices' anomalous results. Whatever it is, it'll be new physics. If one of these things does work, it will be the 21st century's double slit experiment.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-slit_experiment"
EmDrive,3c6w6y,bitofaknowitall,4,Mon Jul 6 16:51:46 2015 UTC,"Yes. On the negative side, these people want to see the effect. And when you do experiment with a certain preferred outcome, it's too easy to make a mistake in your favor.  I see no thrust? Something must be wrong. Repeat. Oh, there is thrust (slightly above the noise level), now it must be right! Publish results.  A more in-depth look into Woorward's experiments on his student's website: http://www.otherhand.org/home-page/physics/graduate-studies-in-physics-at-cal-state-university-fullerton/  Quote:   But Tom, is this stuff ……real?

EmDrive,3c6w6y,kamill85,5,Mon Jul 6 18:22:18 2015 UTC,"Science the ideal and science the reality are different things. It's very very hard to not have some kind of emotional investment in the outcome of an important experiment. Ideal dispassionate scientists are somewhere out there in the aethyr dancing with unicorns, the Perfectly Rational Actor from economics, and Jim Morrison.  The problem is that science is a lot of work, and people generally do not engage in hard things without some form of emotional motivation.  So you do kind of want a positive result, and you get a positive result. What do you do? Un-want to get a positive result and repeat the experiment? How do you know you've un-wanted it enough? Or do you publish and see what other people get?  That's why we have peer review and -- much more importantly -- replication. Peer review (ideally) answers the question of whether or not the experimenter seemed to be aboard the clue train -- it's a basic bar you have to pass. Replication answers the more important question of whether or not the phenomenon exists when people try to replicate it in a different state of mind."

EmDrive,3c6w6y,Zouden,2,Tue Jul 7 02:55:31 2015 UTC,"If via some effect, it'd be possible to change object's mass, even a little bit, wouldnt the best test-device be:  A test-bed (on a scale) with motor/power source, remotely controlled. A disc with many smaller objects (that can change mass), attached all around its edges. Disc would be rotated by the motor and mass-objects would trigger only while crossing to the lower half of the disc (while it is spinning).   If I'm not mistaken, this would create directional imbalance that would decrease/increase pressure against the scale (so virtual weight of the test unit). More importantly, if the effect is so hardly measurable, it could be easily multiplied by increasing the motor speed.  Could someone elaborate on that?"
EmDrive,3c6w6y,TortugaTerritory,0,Mon Jul 6 11:47:06 2015 UTC,"Mach concluded that inertial mass only exists because the universe contains multiple objects. When a gyroscope is spinning, it resists being pushed around because it is interacting with the Earth, the stars, and distant galaxies. If those objects didn't exist, the gyroscope would have no inertia.   A gyroscope doesn't resist being pushed around at all. It resists rotation perpendicular to it's axis of rotation, but not translation. The evidence is flawed."
EmDrive,3c6w6y,Zouden,4,Sun Jul 5 15:47:16 2015 UTC,"I suppose he meant ""rotated"" when saying ""pushed around"".

EmDrive,3c5ptc,Gibybo,3,Sun Jul 5 10:50:46 2015 UTC,"the most infuriating part is that the skeptics keep moving the goalposts.  skeptics said it was air being heated by the rig  then NASA tested it in a vaccum, refuting the hypothesis that the thrust was due to interaction with air.  skeptics said it was the RF interfering with the scales  so the experimenters used a torsion balance, and yet despite every hypothesis the skeptics put forth being utterly disproven, they still cling to their beliefs.  the only hypothesis which explains the results, and hasn't been refuted, is the hypothesis that the effect is real."
EmDrive,3c5ptc,SmokeMathHeilSatin,3,Sun Jul 5 20:12:50 2015 UTC,"i think some of the theories put forth to explain how the EMdrive produces thrust are pretty goddamn loopy.  but you know what?  not a single testable theory has been put forth as to how the same measurement error is occuring in dozens of different experiments with different setups, all specifically designed to eliminate sources of error.  the problem is that skeptics refuse to accept that disproving the existence of the effect requires an explanation of exactly what is causing the measurement errors, and how it is causing them.  that fundamental misunderstanding of the scientific method doesnt just damage the credibility of the skeptics, it completely destroys it."
EmDrive,3c5ptc,SmokeMathHeilSatin,5,Sun Jul 5 19:36:44 2015 UTC,"In order for the results to be taken seriously by the mainstream scientific community, there needs to be serious error analysis.

When questions were presented saying to the effect that meep the software simulator might be giving false information because of propagating errors. I somewhat agreed but in other ways it rubbed me the wrong way.  I answered: So... using standard physics in simulations will not give us any foundations to go on? Fact. The numerical simulations have been used for years, the're used in the designing of CERN, fiber optic communications, and in cad and in just about every aspect of numerical modeling in engineering and physics I can think of. They are not perfect but I remember getting my slide rule out and using cheaters to see the divisions better. Yes, they are not perfect, but it is what we have other than our gray matter and a pencil and that sucks. ;)  Let's back up and regroup so I can feel better because I'm feeling pretty funky right now. I believe there is enough empirical data in such widely varying test beds and that this is just enough out of the noise of chance that there is something going on and it deserves further testing. Agreed? Maybe? Why are you here? Just a little hope? Ya, I knew it you really don't want us laying in the dirt to look at the stars. That's cool.  We have worlds of ideology clashing into this thing. Standard Physics, you know ohms law, speed of light, gravity. wait...um gravity doesn't belong there, damn, we still are not sure how it works, so out it goes...poof. So we have Einstein's work, CoM, CoE Maxwell's and a beautiful host of other that fit perfectly into our standard model. What, they all don't, we still have questions? Poo.  Ok I got it now I can fix this! What makes all these very nice and obeyed laws work so beautifully (well kinda)? Quantum MECHANICS QV QM QED PMS and lets just throw in a black hole so we can suck it all up so nothing matters. Sorry, it does matter, I was kidding. They all matter but they are like the kid under the stairs, a little freaky with glowing eyes. They are so different than the standard model. But, but, but, they make the standard model work. Phew, now here we are trying to figure out how to go backwards from normal physics and a can of microwaves down to quantum world to make thrust, to make it go, to understand. You know it's not easy. Things will not click and work quite like they should and we need to be diligent and have hope.  Is it worth it, you bet, will they be questions, yep. And every bit of it it worth it.

EmDrive,3c5ptc,See-Shell,5,Sun Jul 5 01:54:44 2015 UTC,"The problem with this for me is that it breaks well known laws under conditions where these laws are very well tested. The experimental data on EmDrive so far is not enough to stand against all the other experimental data which conforms exactly to Maxwell's equations. Maxwell's equations imply conservation of both energy and momentum (see http://www.physics.oregonstate.edu/~minote/COURSES/ph632/lib/exe/fetch.php?media=emch6.pdf ).  Thus in order to save EmDrive it is almost guaranteed that some kind of spacetime distortion, gravity-related effect, or exotic matter has to be involved. This kind of stuff usually requires huge energies, though."
EmDrive,3c5ptc,sorrge,4,Sun Jul 5 02:07:46 2015 UTC,"Yes it does and if you're saying it breaks laws is a problem your looking at it wrong. It's simply a clue, nothing more nothing less.

We learn we are not always right. If it does what it does by interacting in some way with the Quantum world or space time or pizza pie, we'll figure it out. The time now is for data.  edit: speeling"
EmDrive,3c5coa,SlangFreak,12,Sat Jul 4 23:13:42 2015 UTC,"Yes, it's pretty obvious to anyone who understands basic kinematics that any equation which relates energy to a constant thrust necessarily breaks conservation of energy. Unfortunately not everyone (including Shawyer) understands basic kinematics :(  If the EmDrive works, it breaks conservation of energy. This doesn't make it impossible (for example, we know that dark energy breaks conservation of energy in some sense on a universal scale already), but it is important to keep in mind."
EmDrive,3c5coa,Gibybo,10,Sun Jul 5 00:25:15 2015 UTC,"i'd say if the EMdrive works, its not going to follow shawyer's predictions.  it is important to seperate shawyer's theories (which are completely unproven, and defy logic) from the thrust anomaly (which is completely proven, the only question is whether its a measurement error or a genuine effect)  the scientific approach to the EMdrive (for skeptics) would be to come up with a testable hypothesis about how the measurement error is caused, and then running an experiment designed to not be vulnerable to that source of measurement error.  but not a single skeptic has ever put forth a testable theory explaining how the measurement error is affecting all the different EMdrive test rigs. they're too busy shouting ""MUH NEWTONS LAWS!"" and attacking the people who are running the experiments and trying to figure out if its a measurement error or a genuine effect.  its like a bunch of creationists running around a biology lab saying ""you cant explain how the eye formed! therefore god did it!"""

EmDrive,3c5coa,Gibybo,3,Mon Jul 6 04:44:17 2015 UTC,"No the vaccine people definitely call into the first category of crazy denialists. We can definitely see the reasons why vaccines work.   Part of the reason it looks like skeptics are so arrogant is because the standard for showing that something is correct is orders of magnitude more rigorous than showing why something could be incorrect. Like, in math all it takes to disprove a conjecture is one counterexample, but to prove a conjecture, you basically have to show that a counterexample is impossible. It might feel like skeptics are assholes that don't want to see this succeed, but truth be told, if someone doesn't point out why something could be wrong, then we run the risk of getting caught up in a collective delusion about reality.   The point is that if the experimenters can show beyond a reasonable doubt that the Em Drive isn't just a byproduct of magnetic coupling, or buoyancy, or some yet to be determined error then we can really start figuring out how this works."

EmDrive,3c5coa,SmokeMathHeilSatin,3,Mon Jul 6 04:30:57 2015 UTC,"the burden of proof lies on those proposing explanations for the measurement anomaly.   Sure, but the claim that it is a reaction-less drive is about 10 orders of magnitude more extraordinary than the claim of measurement error so it requires vastly more evidence."
EmDrive,3c5coa,Gibybo,3,Mon Jul 6 05:23:22 2015 UTC,"and i completely agree with you on that.  the proponents have very limited evidence, in the form of numerous failed attempts by independent researchers to isolate sources of interference. the only thing that can be justified by their evidence, is further research into the phenomenon.  meanwhile the skeptics have literally no evidence, they are completely basing their position upon established theories which have failed to explain the source of the thrust anomaly, and they keep saying ""why are you all wasting your time testing this?"", they are dismissing an observed phenomenon soely because they dont like the popular explanation for it.  tl;dr - the proponents have infinite orders of magnitude more evidence than the skeptics, because the skeptics dont even have a testable theory."
EmDrive,3c5coa,SmokeMathHeilSatin,2,Mon Jul 6 06:29:32 2015 UTC,"It sounds like you are saying it's more likely that it works than it doesn't because no one knows what's going on yet and we have reports of thrust. That's not really logical though.  Take this other proposed free energy generator as an example: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jiAhiu6UqXQ. Obviously this doesn't have the level of evidence that the EmDrive has, but it does have some evidence: a video. I don't know how he's doing what he's doing. I have a few guesses, but ultimately I don't have a provable theory for where he's getting the energy from. Even if I did reproduce this video (maybe with a hidden battery), it doesn't prove that he was doing it the same way.  It's not logical to compare the amount of evidence we have for this video being real vs the amount of evidence we have of a theory that disproves it. What we really have to compare is what we already know based on experiments with fans, magnets, light bulbs, thermodynamics, electromagnetism, etc vs what this video appears to show.   The same is true for the EmDrive. We have to compare the experimental results for the EmDrive vs the millions of previous experiments with magnetrons, electromagnetism, conductors, conservation of energy/momentum, relativity, etc. It's not at all necessary to prove exactly what is happening in each of the EmDrive experiments so far reported. We couldn't even if we wanted to. Most of them have very little scientific rigor, publish very few details of their setups, are not peer reviewed, and generally don't even agree with each other.  I can't prove the drive is a fluke just as I can't prove the guy in that video wasn't using a hidden battery on the back of the fan. The beauty is that I don't have to. I just have to wait and see if the people advocating for it and testing it can prove that it works (and I sure hope they can!).   ""why are you all wasting your time testing this?"", they are dismissing an observed phenomenon soely because they dont like the popular explanation for it.   I think we both agree that it's absolutely interesting enough to investigate further, and writing it off as a waste of time at this point would be a tremendous shame, but it is at least understandable why people think that way."

That's not really logical though.   close, but not quite.  i'm saying its more likely that it works than it doesnt, because the experimental design has been refined dozens of times by many qualified independent researchers, and each refinement of the experimental design has failed to eliminate the anomaly.  failure to find the source of error is not evidence that any specific theory is correct, but the inability of anyone to even propose any new potential sources of error, let alone suggest a refinement to the experimental design, indicates that our current physics theories cannot explain how the experimental setup is flawed. in essence, whether the EMdrive can be used as a thruster or not, new physics is required to explain the anomaly.  i wont be 100% sure until the EMdrive has been tested in space and shown to function as a thruster, but what i have seen has made me confident that it is worth doing a test in space, if only to end the controversy once and for all."

However KE = 1/2MV2 has not yet been proven to apply to a ship continuously accelerating using energy from it's own power supply.

The Q factor is calculated as the angular frequency of a resonator multiplied by the energy stored divided by power dissipated.  You can think of it as a measure of how many times the resonator would oscillate before it would exhaust its store of energy and come to rest.  You can read more about it here

Higher Q indicates a lower rate of energy loss relative to the stored energy of the resonator; the oscillations die out more slowly. A pendulum suspended from a high-quality bearing, oscillating in air, has a high Q, while a pendulum immersed in oil has a low one.

This force is higher than from photon emission alone and it has been tested in a vacuum so it is not thermal related.  The force is inconsistent with the physical orientation of the device and there are many test/calibration issues which have limited testing the device.  Shawyer has also not published enough test data and detail to support many of his claims.  The comparison of experimental results can be found here: http://emdrive.wiki/Experimental_Results  Figures of merit are Q (higher should in theory provide more expected thrust),  and Force/PowerInput (you expect this ratio to be the same for drives that have the same Q value, otherwise you have to nominalize the ratio for the Q factor and this table doesn't show that).

EmDrive,3c1tgl,wallofwolfstreet,9,Fri Jul 3 23:48:02 2015 UTC,"I'm being a bit of a pedant, but like I said, I've actually been personally involved with some of the confusion people have with poynting vectors and whether they correspond to force.  A Poytning vector is the flow of EM power, but when you divide by c2 (which is confusingly often called the poynting vector as well) you end up with linear momentum.  As such, its the change in the poynting vector that leads to force (force is the time rate of change of momentum) .  A non-zero, yet constant poynting vector, will have NO force associated to it.  As I linked in the NSF comment, this wikipedia figure has a net Poynting vector, but obviously there is zero force.       Just felt like some people thought that the MEEP runs were indicating a net force.  From what we have seen so far, all we know is that there may have been a transient force on the drive before steady state, but that alone can't possibly account for the claims of constant force being created."

EmDrive,3c1tgl,zurael,3,Sat Jul 4 08:54:06 2015 UTC,"Good clarification.  A non zero poynting vector would be an energy gradient, is that correct?"
EmDrive,3c1tgl,zurael,4,Sat Jul 4 01:45:33 2015 UTC,"No, because an energy gradient has units J/m=N!  For example take the gradient of gravitational potential energy.  mgh becomes (0,0,mg), which is just the force of gravity.  The poynting vector is a power flux with units of W/m2 (when looking at it from the power perspective, no dividing by c2 this time).    If we could draw a surface in 3D space and calculate the net poynting vector through that surface using an integral, we would get the net EM power through that surface in units of Watts.   Another way to discern the difference is that an energy gradient can occur without a power flow (such as the potential energy gradient that occurs in a column of water as you go from the bottom to the top), while a poynting vector is specifically indicative of power flowing."
EmDrive,3c1tgl,zurael,5,Sat Jul 4 03:59:51 2015 UTC,"Ok, so a poynting vector is an energy flux (a flux like a heat transfer, or the movement of electrons in a conductor), while an energy gradient is a change in energy, like a mass having different potential energy in a different spot in a gravitational field?

The ideal is the usual truncated cone with two flat (or ideally curved facing) surfaces. If using flat surfaces the width of the big end (wb) should be longer than the axial length of the cavity (l) so that the Unruh waves set up by the photons bouncing between the ends (some taking a diagonal route longer than l) 'fit' at the wide end, but not at the narrow. I can give a formula for wb=fn(l,ws) It could be set up with baffles at the short end to further break up waves there. It could be set up 'short' so that l~ws (width of the small end) instead, so the Unruh wavelengths fit better at the short end and deliberately de-harmonise the wider width, then there may be a smaller reverse thrust, but this is likely to be difficult to achieve (note: this is all approximate since I don't have a full 3-d model)."""

It obeys the momentum conservation law, and it cannot possibly be ""asymmetrical"" in the sense that it will push one side more than another (unless there is a EM radiation source inside which is not attached to the device). If the simulation suggests otherwise, this must be due to numerical integration errors, as far as I understand. Essentially this amounts to the phenomenon observed here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YS9FmQPnas8 . That physics engine also has large numerical errors which apparently cause some asymmetry in the forces.

To quote myself from the other thread:   Amazing results have just been posted by Dr. Rodal analyzing the Meep data provided by Aero. The analysis shows asymmetry in something called the Poynting field. This asymmetry specifically contradicts the theory put forward by Greg Egan et al. To quote Dr. Rodal    There is a strong, definite Poynting vector from the small base towards the big base... This would mean, that in order to satisfy Conservation of Momentum, the copper cone needs to move.   Of course, more work needs to be done, but this appears to be absolutely monumental."

In order to conserve momentum, the device must be propulsed in the other direction. So, it's a yes but.  The buts are several. If the simulation has not been running long enough, it could be misleading (picture having only a few stills of a cilinder in a diesel engine doing only part of the cycle and how misleading could it be). They have to show that the forces simulated are on the ballpark of those measured in experiments, and find a mechanism that allows the momentum to leave the cavity. But even then, the effort done so far has been herculean and they deserve some praise.  Edit: Many typos.  Edit 2: I've not studied enough the thread to know all the details. One specially important is if the poynting vector is constant, which merely indicates a flow of energy but no force (and therefore no thrust) or monotonically  increases (which means a force).

However in the real world for a 2.4Ghz frequency you'd probably want a 100ps (that's pico or 10-12 ) or better resolution because a full wave at 2.4Ghz is about 0.42 ns (420 ps) long."

EmDrive,3c1w5v,noname-_-,15,Sat Jul 4 00:13:36 2015 UTC,"Ok, So I'm /u/god_uses_a_mac (obviously....). I have a B.S. in electrical engineering, focus in power electronics and power systems. I will readily admit that RF and Emag are not my specialities, but I have a decent understanding of both, and a very deep mathematics and physics background.  I'm currently an electrical engineer at a very, very large U.S. company in a relevant industry. I reddit a lot from work (during my downtime), so I'd prefer to avoid public discussion of my employer.  I've been actively following emdrive news since it first popped up last summer. I even reached out to Shawyer last year about doing research work on Emdrives for Master's or PhD work out of undergrad, but he wasn't a fan of this idea. Since then, I've kept on top of the news and other announcements about the Emdrive and similar reactionless thrusters.  My stance on Emdrives is somewhat well-documented on this sub. I am fully convinced that anomalous thrust is being produced by Shawyer's, Cannae's, and other similar drives. However, I do not currently accept any theories as to why they work, because such theories are really just well-supported speculation at best. Theory isn't god to me though, and I only argue to defend existing understandings of physics. I'm not going to support or promote one idea over the other.  I currently moderate four subreddits. Two are mostly inactive, and two are small, active, private ones. The main reason I want to help moderate this sub is to keep things on-track and transparent. The past few weeks on this sub have seen things start to veer away from good discussion, and closer towards hero worship in certain threads, with a lot of noise from a select few individuals. Smaller subs like this can be especially fallible towards individuals overwhelming the discussion, and I want to  discourage that, because I think strong discussion is really important here. Additionally, the past few days on reddit have shown us what can happen when supposed 'community leaders' don't properly communicate with the community, and I'm not a fan of that.   I don't have an interest in 'ruling' anyone, but I want to make sure that this subreddit remains a decent place for discussion. This means preventing harassment of users, but also reminding individuals to not dominate the sub.    EDIT:  I just saw the update; Here are more direct responses to the questions posted.   What is your view on moderation?   Moderating is about maintaining the community focus. It's not censorship to remove inappropriate users or posts, as much as people like to think so. Generally, with smaller subs like this, moderating can be left to the community for the most part (in terms of up/down votes). But moderators shouldn't hesitate to act to keep the subreddit on the rails  when need be. I suspect moderator actions won't be incredibly common until the sub gets more popular.  I also prefer open moderation. Moderators should answer for their actions when questioned, and be open about any massive changes to the subreddit. I'm as much a part of the community as anyone else, and I'd like to make sure it stays a community.      How would you handle trolls?   Accusations of trolling are probably a lot more common than actual trolls, but it's fairly easy to discern real ""trolls."" from people having different opinions and ideas. With that said, users who are repeatedly trolling can be banned without harming the community. (though I don't think it will happen often.)   How would you handle inappropriate posts?   I think to answer this question, the mods and community will probably need to work out a definition of inappropriate. Generally, posts that are grossly irrelevant, not work safe, or otherwise damaging to the community as a whole should be removed. This is not censorship, it's moderating.    How would you handle disrespectful or condescending users?   PM'd warnings, public warnings, temporary and permanent bans, in that order. Depending of course on the severity of the situation.

If they breach the rules, they will be removed. If I think it's inappropriate but it doesn't breach the rules, the rules should be discussed with the community.   How would you handle disrespectful or condescending users?   Warnings and temporary bans."
EmDrive,3c1w5v,Zouden,11,Sat Jul 4 11:47:38 2015 UTC,"I've been following the EmDrive (and Cannae drive) with growing enthusiasm for almost a year, and /r/emdrive for the last few months.  Over the last couple months I have checked this subreddit less and less often because every time I do, it seems to be filled with a larger proportion of pseudo-science from people who do not understand basic physics. With the recent drama, I investigated further and found that almost all of if comes from TheTravellerEMD and the support he gets from UnclaEnzo.  I had almost written off this sub figuring they had pretty much taken it over and driven everyone else away. I'm glad to say I was wrong. You've recognized the problem and acted appropriately, so I once again have hope for this sub.  I don't know who the new mod(s) should be, but I feel like picking people who understand basic physics is a requirement. I'm not talking about some predisposed belief about how emdrive physics work. I just mean someone who understands things like how to calculate kinetic energy in multiple reference frames, a basic understanding of the Tsiolkovsky rocket equation, how to calculate the energy of a photon, knows what the michelson-morley experiment is and so on. I think we can agree that any new information we learn will come from science rather than 'so and so said so's and 'just and wait and see's' so that's really the direction I'd like to see the sub go in."

EmDrive,3c1w5v,Zouden,5,Sat Jul 4 11:49:28 2015 UTC,"I don't really see why the mods need to have a science background. It sounds like you're arguing that the mods should be filtering out the pseudoscience. Considering our subject matter that would be difficult, to say the least. Plus there are tons of users who will happily point out how nonsensical Shawyer's theories are every time they come up. No mod intervention needed.  A mods job is just to make sure everyone respects each other and let them debate freely. A mod shouldn't be promoting one idea over another. If they follow that principle then no technical knowledge is needed.   With that said, it wouldn't hurt to have at least one mod who has a grasp of the relevant math and physics.  But it doesn't need to be a job requirement."

Plus there are tons of users who will happily point out how nonsensical Shawyer's theories are every time they come up. No mod intervention needed.   And yet half of the front page was nonsensical posts by TheTravellerEMD just a few days ago. When new people come to this sub and see that, they simply turn away.   A mod shouldn't be promoting one idea over another. If they follow that principle then no technical knowledge is needed.   They don't need to promote one over another. They just need to prevent the zealots promoting illogical ideas from driving all reasonable discussion away."
EmDrive,3c1w5v,Gibybo,5,Sat Jul 4 03:13:45 2015 UTC,"I saw a post in one of the reputable science subs. Someone asked a question about the emdrive.  A mod simply stated it can not work, then locked the topic.  Any future mod should be able to compensate for any preconceptions they might have."

EmDrive,3c1w5v,Gibybo,3,Sat Jul 4 18:58:46 2015 UTC,"The reason it would be hard to weed out the pseudoscience is that this is a subreddit about a pseudoscience device.  Shawyer's theory is clearly pseudoscientific.  And really no current theory of the EmDrive besides ""its a hoax"" is fully grounded in mainstream physics. If we start trying to weed out arguments we deem pseudoscientific or illogical, we'd have to start with the guy who invented the EmDrive.  If you don't like him and his followers, that's fine, but keeping them out of a subreddit dedicated to his device strikes me as an odd position to take."
EmDrive,3c1w5v,bitofaknowitall,3,Sat Jul 4 23:43:43 2015 UTC,"The EmDrive is not a pseudoscience device. Developing a new theory about how it works is not psuedoscience, it's just new science. The problem with Shawyer's theory has nothing to do with proposing new science. He incorrectly uses existing science. If you are proposing a theory for how something works that is based on an existing theory, you should absolutely understand that existing theory. Shawyer simply doesn't. It's painfully obvious to anyone who understands relativity that Shawyer tries to build on top of relativity without understanding it himself. To someone who doesn't understand it themselves, it may just look like Shawyer is proposing a credible theory that uses fancy math to explain something new."
EmDrive,3c1w5v,Gibybo,5,Sun Jul 5 00:04:28 2015 UTC,"At first I strongly disagreed with you, but after thinking about it, you're probably right.  Anyone who thinks clearly can usually spot the pseudo scientific thinking and then ask another person with specific knowledge on that subject for verification.  But for the sake of a high quality forum u/Gibybo is also correct.  If you look at Stack Exchange programming, the experts that run it are very quick to reject, close and remove poor quality questions.  This makes it very unfriendly for people with basic and sometimes silly questions.  However it makes it very useful for expert level people.  Stack Exchange physics, however entertains all types of questions as long as you aren't trying to get them to solve homework problems for you.  They are all physicists, so it can work sometimes.  Personally I prefer a balance between expert and entry level discussions.  tldr; A good mod doesn't need to be an expert in the field or even have a science background to be fair."

EmDrive,3c1w5v,dftba-ftw,12,Sat Jul 4 02:13:15 2015 UTC,"Introduction  Hey! My name is Taven. Been here from the start! I'm a web developer / web designer / special effects artist. I've got no skin or reputation in the game, whatever the theory, whatever the results, I'm just here because I have a love for science and I'm amazed by both the prospects of the EmDrive, the DIY engineers, and the open source science taking place!   Even if I don't get a moderation position, as there's already wonderful people running, I'd be happy to just help with the CSS or any internal workings of the subreddit. I live and breathe that stuff!  What is your opinion on the EmDrive?  I'm completely neutral / agnostic to the device. I have no opinion one way or the other. I'm just here for the ride! You won't see me speculating or debating, just chiming in when I have the source of some information that might be helpful.  What is your view on moderation?  I used to be the moderator of a large company forum, so this is something I have experience in! A moderator is a public servant - he or she puts themselves below those they serve, not above. Your will is that of the people, and like a forest ranger, a moderator's job is to maintain the natural environment for everyone to enjoy. This is achieved through communication, respect, neutrality, and fairness.  How would you handle trolls?  Trolls are a lot less common than one might think. Most often it's someone who is either not socially aware of how their posts look or they've taken an fervent opposing stance in an argument because they find it hard to imagine how others could think otherwise. Few actually incite on purpose, especially on forums that attract a more mature audience like this one.  I don't treat people like trolls or hunt for trolls - I don't ever use the word - I treat people like people. I contact those causing disruptions privately, help them understand how their actions may look to others, and work with them to discourage their behavior, and of course listen to them, as it may explain why they are acting the way they are. Only if absolutely necessary, in cases of genuine malice, is action warranted.  How would you handle disrespectful or condescending users?  Communication. Contact them, discuss their behavior and how it may be offending others or breaking rules, and warn them that certain behaviors are not permitted. Not in a ""STOP RIGHT THERE CRIMINAL SCUM!"" but in a friendly, ""Hey! You might not have known, but this behavior is not allowed here."" Often all that users need is a reminder. I'm there to help them too! Only when communication fails multiple times, and they continue to disrespect others, is strict action taken.   How would you handle inappropriate posts?  As for posts - deletion is something to be avoided, as it removes transparency of both the situation and your actions. Only when clearly spam or when content is designed to directly incite other users and if not removed would cause further fighting, is deletion necessary.  Thanks for reading!"
EmDrive,3c1w5v,Taven,4,Sat Jul 4 15:54:19 2015 UTC,"I think it would be absolute fantastic if the nominated users could come in here and introduce themselves, give their opinion on the em drive ( believer, non-believer, sceptical but curious, etc...), and give us their view on moderation ( how do they like to handle trolls, inappropriate posts, disrespectful or condescending users).  After a few weeks of getting disillusioned by this sub I feel hopeful about its fresh start and I feel that democratically voting on the direction this sub takes its absolutely the right choice; I want to get to know the potential moderators (beyond name recognition and comment history stalking) before endorsing someone (or a few someone's). Especially seeing how this sub was close to the brink, largely due to moderation issues."

EmDrive,3c1w5v,bitofaknowitall,4,Sat Jul 4 01:42:58 2015 UTC,"if you're applying, please post a small introduction about yourself and answer the following questions.   Hello, I'm bitofaknowitall.  I'd like to be a mod to make sure this subreddit stays open and accepting of all viewpoints on the EmDrive.  First thing you should know about me is that I'm not a scientist.  I like to think that I represent the silent majority on this subreddit, who are redditors that find this all interesting but don't really understand the equations enough to meaningfully contribute.  That's why I started the summaries of the NSF forum posts.  I want to make sure the subreddit remains accessible for everyone.  I want to make sure this is an environment were people feel comfortable asking any questions no matter how uninformed they might be when they ask.   What is your opinion on the EmDrive?   I am hopeful that it is real.  I lie awake at night thinking about the possibilities the EmDrive would enable.  I've been outlining a novel based on an EmDrive-like device suddenly giving every garage tinkerer the ability to access space.  Just thinking about how that would change the world makes it hard for me to be a proper skeptic.  I want to believe.  With that said, I won't be going around telling people outside this subreddit about the EmDrive until there's either a space test or an EmDrive levitates.   What is your view on moderation?   Moderators should get involved as little as possible.  I don't think it is a moderator's place to judge the quality of posts.  Rather, the primary job of a moderator is to keep things civil. We have some very knowledgeable users here who will be quick to point out scientific fallacies.     How would you handle trolls? How would you handle inappropriate posts? How would you handle disrespectful or condescending users?   Trolls on brand-new usernames I would not hesitate to ban.  I would delete inappropriate, disrespectful and hurtful posts and then warn the user to read the rules and try again, rather then banning on their first strike.  I've made my position clear in the past on what sort of posts I do not find appropriate.  I also am happy to answer people's ""what's this emdrive thing all about"" fifty million times.  I always try and make sure each post on her has at least one comment answering their questions.  Though I'll keep trying to do that regardless.  Thanks and I'll see you all again on Monday morning for the weekly NSF summary!"

EmDrive,3by7ii,EricThePerplexed,14,Fri Jul 3 05:43:21 2015 UTC,They use meep software an open source wave EM simulation software and are taking the data to project into 3D representations of RF actions within the cavity. Dr Rodal has been computing out the Poynting vectors which even more than the pretty pictures of wave actions show the forces of the EM waves. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poynting_vector  This is great science and I'm glad to be a tiny itsy bitsy part.  PS: I'll continue to post here and offer what little I know and give everyone a summary of my EMDrive build. Sorry I got my panties in a wad a bit ago and stormed off in a huff.

EmDrive,3by7ii,zurael,12,Fri Jul 3 03:46:37 2015 UTC,"It's smart to keep in mind that poynting vectors average out to 0 after all is said and done. Here is the big BUT. If you can manipulate the EM environment to make the poynting vectors not zero, then we are are onto something. Even if we see the patterns of poynting vectors over time =0 within the cavity and how they form and decay it still will be good data.   This isn't simple maths that Dr. Rodal is doing and my hat is off to him for his knowledge and his dedication."

EmDrive,3by7ii,See-Shell,12,Fri Jul 3 04:27:49 2015 UTC,"Ok I'll try using an analogy but first hard stuff.  In physics, the Poynting vector represents the directional energy flux density (the rate of energy transfer per unit area) of an electromagnetic field. From wiki article.  Imagine you see a calm lake, then you throw in a stone. The waves spread out from the impact point of the stone with a speed and direction that was imparted by the stone. The direction, force and amplitude of each wave carries with in it energy from the stone you threw.  Poynting is the same analogy but using Electromagnetic waves instead of waves in water. It's like the sum of the parts of the energy that makes up a Electromagnetic wave (Microwaves, Radio waves etc) points to the direction of those forces."

EmDrive,3by7ii,andygood,2,Fri Jul 3 11:30:49 2015 UTC,"From my last Scientific Visualization graduate course, its basically a vector field visualization that denotes the direction and magnitude of the context the vectors represent. In a simple analogy, when I coded some of my projects, the professor hand out a datafile representing measurements of air flow in an airplane wing, using vector fields, we visualized where the air is flowing and the velocity/strength of the air flow.  In the case of the Emdrive, they got measurements of the electromagnetic waves inside the cone, and using the same technique I mention they visualize the direction of the waves, strength and energy, and now are finally seeing what is happening inside this thing.

EmDrive,3by7ii,Crackers91,7,Fri Jul 3 03:41:00 2015 UTC,Can someone explain this in laymen's terms? I'm looking at this and getting confused.
EmDrive,3by7ii,Taylooor,7,Fri Jul 3 08:11:13 2015 UTC,"Ok I'll try and this can be confusing stuff.  A wave in a pool of water ""remembers"" to keep moving on the water because of the energy it contains, make sense?  And if you think about it, it has to be more than just energy. That ""energy""  the wave is made of are all the things that make it a wave, like size, direction, mass, frequency, even it's color. It's a lot of stuff! All these things can be categorized one by one and then added up on a computer to see that wave being a wave.   What happens in the computer simulations. All the parts that make microwaves behave like they do are programed into the computer and they have parts too, just like waves in the water have. Run the program and see the wave on the computer screen ""being a wave"" like this... (almost looks like a wave in the water) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poynting_vector#/media/File:DipoleRadiation.gif  We take a slice of time and freeze the action, to see the evaluate the forces of ""identity"" that make a wave a wave. One is called a Poynting Vector which is the electric and magnetic of parts a RF wave.    If that part of the wave called the poynting vector adds up unusually it can provide the clue needed for why the EMDrive has it's thrust. So far we have just looked at a small piece of time but it was very interesting. We shall see what the rest of the time slices show."
EmDrive,3by7ii,See-Shell,5,Fri Jul 3 10:43:50 2015 UTC,"Cheers, that makes a lot of sense. Was hard to get a decent understanding when a lot of the discussion was quite detailed.

EmDrive,3by7ii,TheRedFireFox,6,Fri Jul 3 14:04:38 2015 UTC,Are they saying that they ran a computer simulation and it's showing thrust?
EmDrive,3by7ii,kleinergruenerkaktus,11,Fri Jul 3 03:59:06 2015 UTC,"no, it's like one cycle in a 4 stroke engine. Just one piece."
EmDrive,3by7ii,kleinergruenerkaktus,4,Fri Jul 3 04:05:45 2015 UTC,So you think we need more cycle parts to optimize the EMDrives output ? If yes what do you have in mind?
EmDrive,3by7ii,andygood,12,Fri Jul 3 07:49:19 2015 UTC,"No, she is saying it's just a visualization of one moment of the drives operation, like a visualizing a cycle of a 4 stroke engine. One moment later and the situation changes. As long as it is not clear if the vectors average out to zero over the whole cycle, this result does not mean much."
EmDrive,3by7ii,kleinergruenerkaktus,7,Fri Jul 3 08:22:29 2015 UTC,"Nope, I'm saying that they have real measurements from previous EMdrive tests, and are using many vector fields and electromagnetic math/techniques to visualize/analyze what is happening inside the cavity.  TL;DR they are visualizing what is happening inside the apparatus, now to decipher what is causing the thrust."
EmDrive,3by7ii,andygood,7,Fri Jul 3 04:02:46 2015 UTC,"I think it's based on aero's Meep data, a simulation software for electromagnetic fields. So it is not visualizing real world experimental data.

This would mean, that in order to satisfy Conservation of Momentum, the copper cone needs to move in the direction towards the small base to balance the energy flow in the opposite direction.  Alternatively, the Poynting vector field may all get dissipated into heat at the big base."""
EmDrive,3by7ii,lmbfan,7,Fri Jul 3 09:26:12 2015 UTC,"I've read it, but it still does not make sense to me. The source of the energy flux is part of the frustum. It is firing into itself. How does a strong energy flux inside the cavity influence its movement in relation to the rest of the universe?"
EmDrive,3by7ii,hms11,5,Fri Jul 3 09:34:07 2015 UTC,"In short, I don't know, but in the interests of wild speculation, is the inside surface of the cavity not the interface between the flux and the rest of the universe? Maybe that's where the interaction has to take place?! My limited understanding, from Dr Rodals comment, is that something has to move in order to satisfy CoM... (unless 'heat dissipation' or the energy flux sums to zero over time)"
EmDrive,3by7ii,LoreChano,2,Fri Jul 3 09:49:54 2015 UTC,Force generation is a response to changing momentum.  https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B7kgKijo-p0iS2tlWnU0QmdiMjg/view?usp=sharing  Answer 2 as this is what is happening inside an accelerating EMDrive.
EmDrive,3by7ii,tchernik,-9,Fri Jul 3 05:01:02 2015 UTC,lol dont waste the keystrokes
EmDrive,3by7ii,spaghetti_david,5,Fri Jul 3 12:34:20 2015 UTC,"Amazing results have just been posted by Dr. Rodal analyzing the Meep data provided by Aero.  The analysis shows asymmetry in something called the Poynting field.  Thus asymmetry specifically contradicts the theory put forward by Greg Egan et al.  To quote Dr. Rodal    There is a strong, definite Poynting vector from the small base towards the big base... This would mean, that in order to satisfy Conservation of Momentum, the copper cone needs to move.   Of course, more work needs to be done, but this appears to be absolutely monumental."
EmDrive,3bx7z8,noname-_-,11,Thu Jul 2 22:12:04 2015 UTC,"Thanks for addressing the situation!   In my opinion, I would appreciate a subreddit where all respectful viewpoints are welcome, and moderation only becomes necessary in the case of personal attacks or non-emdrive related spam.  I also like to consider myself skeptical, but I am also completely cognizant of my own bias in favor of emdrive, because frankly, I would like to be a space captain!  I think it would be appreciated if you could un-ban the users recently banned for their viewpoints (viewpoints that many considered, including myself, completely appropriate and respectful), even though their views may have been seen as inflammatory to a few here."
EmDrive,3bx7z8,zurael,10,Thu Jul 2 22:36:52 2015 UTC,"Yes, I actually unbanned them before creating this post."
EmDrive,3bx7z8,zurael,5,Thu Jul 2 22:40:08 2015 UTC,Thanks very much for your quick action. Looking forward to future discussions here from all viewpoints.
EmDrive,3bx7z8,JesusIsAVelociraptor,6,Thu Jul 2 22:42:31 2015 UTC,I can't speak for everybody but he has already unbanned me at least and I am certainly nobody who would get special treatment.
EmDrive,3bx7z8,JesusIsAVelociraptor,6,Thu Jul 2 22:39:40 2015 UTC,"I understand that you may be hesitant to add any new mods any time soon, but if you do decide to do so. I would suggest that you have some clear rules set out before hand on moderation style, and that you recruit 2 or 3 active users so as to prevent any one mod from succumbing to the temptation to abuse their authority."
EmDrive,3bx7z8,bitofaknowitall,2,Thu Jul 2 22:47:55 2015 UTC,"Yes, this is a great idea.  There was something like 50 users in the beginning so there wasn't really a clear outline on what mods should and shouldn't do, because it didn't really matter much."
EmDrive,3bx7z8,ImAClimateScientist,7,Thu Jul 2 22:51:57 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the unbanning.  I think we're just experiencing drama to fill in the time before more results are posted.  We all like thinking about this, and hoping it's a real thing.  However, right now, we just don't really know.  We have some reason to be optimistic, and some reason to keep our optimism in check.    I don't think this sub needs to be very active.  If someone comes up with a new theory or part of a theory, that's interesting.  If someone has some progress in their home model, that's interesting.  If some lab comes out with some new results, that's definitely interesting.  Aside from that, whatever we talk about is not very interesting.  I would recommend that if we don't have anything substantive to discuss, we let the sub go silent until something new develops."
EmDrive,3bx7z8,bitofaknowitall,5,Thu Jul 2 23:49:50 2015 UTC,"Hey, sorry for the ban.  I think it's going to be hard combining ""hands off moderation"", which people seem to be in favor of, and keeping the sub silent between updates.  That is if people don't keep quiet on their own, which people on the internet usually don't. :)"
EmDrive,3bx7z8,Ponjkl,3,Fri Jul 3 00:01:05 2015 UTC,"Actually, we had.  Just a few days ago, someone posted a thread, ""It's been two days without a post"".    Then, all this drama.  I don't think we need mods to dampen conversation.  We, as a community, can just decide not to get bogged down in useless chatter.  For the most part, that's how we've always done things.  The drama is a very recent development."
EmDrive,3bx7z8,Crackers91,6,Fri Jul 3 00:34:02 2015 UTC,That's true.
EmDrive,3bx7z8,Crackers91,11,Fri Jul 3 00:40:04 2015 UTC,"People need a random blowing off steam, place to chat post.  Might be good to have a few themed weekly threads. I think a weekly ""post your wildest EmDrive predictions here"" thread would be fun.""  and of course a regular thread for new people to ask questions about the EmDrive would be good.   There are a lot of other specialty subreddits with similar schemes.  I'll keep posting my weekly summaries, but I think some other mod-driven discussion posts would be useful.  And no offense, but we need some more active mods.  You've not been active here at all in the last month.  I appreciate you focusing on things now but I want to make sure the mods stay active, so please pick some new mods quickly."
EmDrive,3bx7z8,Crackers91,5,Fri Jul 3 01:52:19 2015 UTC,I nominate /u/bitofaknowitall as mod.
EmDrive,3bx7z8,Crackers91,3,Fri Jul 3 01:59:53 2015 UTC,I've not been a mod before. But I do have two small children.  Seems fairly similar.
EmDrive,3bx7z8,mjmax,2,Fri Jul 3 18:53:14 2015 UTC,Noted.
EmDrive,3bx7z8,bitofaknowitall,3,Fri Jul 3 12:26:06 2015 UTC,"And no offense, but we need some more active mods. You've not been active here at all in the last month. I appreciate you focusing on things now but I want to make sure the mods stay active, so please pick some new mods quickly.   None taken, but I've got the feeling that mod activity was what got us here in the first place.   Hopefully this might lead to something good in the end.  I'll probably start a new thread about mods in a few days when we've ironed out the details of exactly what we want with this sub. It's probably a bad idea to ask people to moderate before we know exactly what it is we want them to do.  Plus, I am - hopefully understandably - hesitant to just ask a few people without first checking with the community."
EmDrive,3bx7z8,slowrecovery,7,Fri Jul 3 17:15:38 2015 UTC,It would be good to have flairs for the post andmaybeaheader
EmDrive,3bx7z8,slowrecovery,3,Fri Jul 3 00:14:38 2015 UTC,Not a bad idea. What types of flairs do you think would be nice to have?
EmDrive,3bx7z8,Henator,3,Fri Jul 3 08:47:46 2015 UTC,"As per the earlier suggestion, what about flairs for stances/beliefs about the drive? And special flairs for those building their own drives."
EmDrive,3bx7z8,Henator,2,Fri Jul 3 09:03:34 2015 UTC,"Just to clarify, are you talking about user flairs or link flairs? I assumed you meant link flairs."
EmDrive,3bx7z8,Henator,2,Fri Jul 3 09:10:57 2015 UTC,I meant link flairs.
EmDrive,3bx7z8,Henator,3,Fri Jul 3 09:27:07 2015 UTC,"Cool. Do you really think stances are appropriate here? I was thinking more like maybe News, Discussion, Question, Original Research, Summary, etc."
EmDrive,3bx7z8,webitube,1 point,Fri Jul 3 10:08:33 2015 UTC,"I'm not really sure if they are or not, I'm just bouncing ideas around hoping to see some discussion. It's a nice feature, but probably not that important."
EmDrive,3bx7z8,JesusIsAVelociraptor,1 point,Fri Jul 3 14:05:38 2015 UTC,I've added quite a few flairs and have applied them to a lot of existing posts. Take a look at the sub front page and tell me what you think.
EmDrive,3bx7z8,webitube,2,Fri Jul 3 14:32:36 2015 UTC,"I like it. I think it's great to split up the links into their various types. Meta conversations are good, but when I want a quick browse during work, the link flair helps to find any recent news/discussion I might want to view..."
EmDrive,3bx7z8,bitofaknowitall,2,Fri Jul 3 14:39:16 2015 UTC,"Excellent! I've sort of bulk applied a lot of the flairs so some might be incorrectly flair:ed, and additional flairs will probably be needed as new posts are created. But that's trivial to fix."
EmDrive,3bx7z8,Zouden,8,Fri Jul 3 14:43:22 2015 UTC,"Apologize for the lengthy post. When I write, I write long, and I know concision is a virtue. Anyway, here goes.   All users should be unbanned. Recent moderator actions have been universally criticized, as demonstrated by this thread, which puts doubt into all bannings.  There should be an effort made to convey that changes have been made and all are welcome back. More than one user have rightfully prepared to leave the subreddit, such as /u/See-Shell, and an exodus of thinking minds is not what we want here; there's few enough of us already. I'd suggest a visual ""rebranding"" of the subreddit to make this clear. As much as possible, debate should be allowed to happen, and all viewpoints, as well as all criticisms of viewpoints, should be permitted. The idea of stifling criticism is ludicrous to scientific thought.   A number of times recently people have mistaken criticism of their posts with criticisms of their person. This topic is a matter of science and criticism is at the heart of science. People should be civil, but I've found lately that ad hominem accusations have had no merit.  The downvotes should do the talking, as they have been lately, and bans really shouldn't be necessary to give out, to prevent mods from having too much power to censor the discussion. Spam is the only thing I'm not hesitant to let moderators outright remove. It should be clear that this is a scientific subreddit, not a place for unwavering devotion to one viewpoint, such as Shawyer's. This doesn't mean such a viewpoint should be censored, however, just that the subreddit should acknowledge the basic scientific tenant of criticism, and such criticism should not be mistaken for pessimism. In general, no more stickying of threads that favor one person as a more credible source of information than another. There should be more active moderators, for redundancy and again to prevent abuses of power. I've expressed support for /u/Zouden already purely for his continuously reasonable and civil attitude in criticizing some other viewpoints, despite some flak he got for it. The voting on such posts consistently shows support for his replies. Remove and publicly archive all the meta discussion to clean the subreddit and improve it's focus.   TL;DR: In summary, I'd encourage unbanning everyone, visually rebranding the subreddit, making it clear it's been changed, welcoming back some of the disgruntled users, encouraging all viewpoints and a scientific mindset, keeping a generally hands-off modding approach where downvotes do the talking, adding new moderators, refraining from holding some users as paragons of information, removing most meta content up to this point, adding new mods, and encouraging polite criticism."

I would suggest using stickied post for mod-driven discussion threads, such as the weekly regular posts I suggested in another reply."
EmDrive,3bx7z8,webitube,3,Fri Jul 3 01:59:02 2015 UTC,"Visually rebranding? If you still want to use the custom Snoo, I'm ok with it. If not, I made it for fun, and I'm glad others could enjoy it."

EmDrive,3bx7z8,slicer4ever,5,Fri Jul 3 20:18:45 2015 UTC,"Maybe we should state our expertise, or some sort of brief anonymous CV as part of our ""flair""?  I want to pontificate freely, but I don't want anyone to think that I'm some sort of expert or scientist.  Far from it.  That way we ""hopeful idiots"" can speak freely without distracting the adults from their work too much."
EmDrive,3bx7z8,LoreChano,3,Fri Jul 3 12:24:01 2015 UTC,"Thinking on it, I moderated another forum and we had an 'introduce yourself' thread, which everyone had to post on before posting elsewhere.  They had to be quite long and properly written, but anonymous.  It actually helped to weed out the trolls.  Sock puppets found it hard not to give themselves away by writing style after a few 'introductions', and it was harder for them to keep their stories straight.  For example one chap claimed to be a tenured maths professor, then  couldn't follow simple mathematical arguments. :-)"
EmDrive,3bx7z8,LoreChano,3,Fri Jul 3 12:59:02 2015 UTC,So how did that work in practice? A mod had to manually approve every user for posting? Sounds a bit like overdoing it to me.  Expertise flairs is not a bad idea.
EmDrive,3bx7z8,Destructor1701,4,Fri Jul 3 13:08:54 2015 UTC,"Yes, you did need to be approved, as we had a huge troll problem - we were discussing a contrarian position with massive political and financial consequences, so we had bands of paid trolls working to undermine it.  I agree that would be overdoing it here.  If we do it, perhaps it could be self-policed by users asking if a person has written their introduction yet?  If even that's too much, maybe just leave it to people to decide whether to post one.  I'd still like the brief 'expertise flair' though, if people agree."

EmDrive,3bx7z8,dingoperson2,8,Fri Jul 3 16:54:57 2015 UTC,"First off, thank you for creating this subreddit.  Second, I like your basic mission statement as-is:  Paraphrasing (and reformatting for at-a-glance, speedread bullets),   The purpose of this subreddit is to share news and have discussions about EmDrive and related-technology. It's allowed to express scepticism and discuss validity of hypotheses. Just do so in a civilized manner. This subreddit is a completely neutral place where both sceptics and those who believe the EmDrive (and similar devices) might work as claimed can read and share news about it. Ridicule is not tolerated.   Flair Suggestion: Maybe some flair to indicate the user's basic stance towards emdrive (e.g., True Believer, Hopeful, Skeptical but Intrigued, Skeptic)?  For the record, I'm also in the Skeptical but Intrigued category."
EmDrive,3bx7z8,greenepc,6,Thu Jul 2 22:28:47 2015 UTC,"Good ideas, I like it. Maybe flairs for those building their own drives too?"
EmDrive,3bx7z8,SmokeMathHeilSatin,6,Thu Jul 2 22:34:16 2015 UTC,I like that idea.
EmDrive,3bx7z8,saucyjacksf,6,Thu Jul 2 22:35:27 2015 UTC,"Yes. I like this idea too.  Also, thinking about it further, I think that flair will (hopefully) help people have a thicker skin if they know in advance where the other person is coming from."
EmDrive,3bx7z8,SmokeMathHeilSatin,4,Thu Jul 2 23:00:27 2015 UTC,"I like the idea of flair for builders.  I don't like the idea of flairs for positions.  It will just lead to everyone automatically downvoting comments from people with opposite view flair, regardless of merit."
EmDrive,3bx7z8,SmokeMathHeilSatin,5,Fri Jul 3 02:02:09 2015 UTC,"I agree. Our viewpoints should be open to change, not tattooed on our foreheads, so to speak."
EmDrive,3bx7z8,Henator,1 point,Fri Jul 3 06:39:02 2015 UTC,"Yes, I see how this could be a problem. It is, however, of course not mandatory to pick a flair. Is that acceptable or do you think we should abandon the idea altogether?"

Stop debating.   Censorship is an unacceptable use of moderator power, and I'm sure most of this subreddit would strongly disagree with this moderator's position. Furthermore, for a topic that is struggling to gain mainstream acceptance, this does not look good. Are we scientists and engineers or are we mindless advocates?"
EmDrive,3bwa50,Zouden,24,Thu Jul 2 18:17:29 2015 UTC,"There's some anonymous quote that says, paraphrasing: ""Science doesn't cuddle ideas. It runs them against a brick wall. If the idea is sound, the pieces that remain will be those of the wall.""  If Shawyer's or anyone else's theories don't stand to fair criticism, they should be abandoned, plain and simple. And even if he stumbled into something important by accident that doesn't make his explanation of it correct. Protecting that for the sake of dreams of space travel won't do any good."

IamAClimateScientist has asked me to share the link to an alternative subreddit they have created, and I will do so.  https://www.reddit.com/r/EmDriveScience/ While I don't believe posting this is in violation of any rule, I will remove my post if it is."

EmDrive,3bwa50,wallofwolfstreet,18,Thu Jul 2 20:53:31 2015 UTC,"Also, it is hardly fair to criticize me for being rightly skeptical yet still intrigued enough to follow this subreddit, when there are others are asserting that the Emdrive is as certain as the sun rising tomorrow.   This is a key point.  Multiple people on this forum (and one major one in particular) have emphatically stated they have ""no doubts"" about the emdrive, ie. they believe in it 100%.  If that opinion is okay (and I believe it is okay for a person to have that opinion if they choose), then it must also be okay for the converse opinion to be valid; that it is a guaranteed certainty the emdrive doesn't work.  So far, I have never seen this opinion.  The ""extremists"" are all in the believing camp."

It does not pretend to be final.""  ""It is simply an organization of working hypotheses—hypotheses that seem to take account of the facts, as we now know them. But is there any intention to stay with these facts? No. There is a continuous quest for more, as though one were eager to grow as though the life of man, and of society here, were to be based on new things, on change, on transformation, rather than on petrifaction and rigidity.

EmDrive,3bwa50,kmccoy,2,Fri Jul 3 14:15:13 2015 UTC,"Apologize in advance for bolding all of this, but I feel this is quite relevant:  Dr. Rodal on the NSF forum has written here  Another forum where the EM Drive is discussed has had some commotion during the last couple of days due to one of the moderators stating that the other forum should not be a place to debate whether the Em Drive works, arguing that debate is contentious, toxic, and unproductive.  This situation has now been corrected in the other forum, as the moderator has resigned.    I want to use this opportunity to strongly re-state again that skeptical views of the EM Drive as an experimental  artifact have always been and will continue to be encouraged in this NSF forum. This NSF forum is not a place to promote companies with a financial stake in the EM Drive (Mr. Shawyer's SPR, Fetta's Cannae, or any other such company with financial interests).  All posts should concentrate on scientific and technological facts, and they are open to scientific debate.  Science requires a healthy dose of skepticism.  There's also a lot of stars above and below this to emphasise it.  I wondered what the hell was going on when the moderator in question was modded. From the first moment he joined there was something 'off' - like a t-------n evangelist. I literally wondered if there could be some personal connections or shenanigans or whatever behind the scenes.

Please contact Shawyer and link him this reddit post.  That way he can avoid this error before the peer reviewers have to weed it out.    One thing I have to say about you Traveller, and I mean this as a genuine compliment, is that you are a truly loyal friend.  You have posted so much content and so many replies have tried to set you straight, and never once have you shown any sign of doubt.    In fact, I tried to address you once over on NSF on the issue of COE and I never got a response. You say the issue is solved because energy is consumed when the drive accelerates (ie. em energy is transferred to kinetic energy).  This alone is not enough, because over-unity effects occur even at constant velocity, a=0, as I posted here.  How does Shawyer's explanation align with COE in this case?"

How then can either ships accumulated Velocity or accumulated KE effect A - F/M? Besides Velocity is only in reference to an external reference frame.  I propose our existing understand of CofE is about to be challenged. As always happens in cases such as these, someone finds a way around the Paradox and Physics becomes happy.

Nothing in physics validates such a relationship, and such a relationship raises issues with the equivalence principle, a foundation of relativity.    However, a constant thrust to power ratio will cause COE to be broken.  Developing a theory such that COE is obeyed during acceleration is not enough to dismiss the COE issue, as I show in the NSF post.    If at all possible, I'd love Shawyer to read that post.     I propose our existing understand of CofE is about to be challenged.   This may very well be true, because as it stands, not one theory of operation for the emdrive obeys COE."

The device, if it work according to Shawyer's theory, creates energy. I have a source that not even you can ignore: Roger Shawyer, director Satellite Propulsion Research Ltd. I direct you to his 2014 paper where he discusses the energy of a interstellar probe equipped with a nuclear reactor able to generate 200 kW of electrical power. That probe should be able after 9,8 years of trave to reach 68% of the speed of light. Shawyer calculates his kinetic energy as 1.87 x 1020 J. Even when he incorrectly uses the classical formula (the real value adjusted for relativistic effect is closer to 2.8 x 1020 J) I can't stress how large is this amount: it's around 850 times of the amount of energy that the Tsar Bomba, the most powerful bomb ever detonated, can (or could) deliver.  Generating this energy with a 200 kW of electrical power would take close to 30 million years.. So clearly the kinetic energy can't come from the ship's power source, or Shawyer's math is bonkers."

EmDrive,3bxm9q,Rowenstin,-1,Fri Jul 3 18:29:14 2015 UTC,"Answer me this.  The ship accelerates at A = F/M as long as it has fuel.  Velocity and KE are measured from another reference frame.  To the ship, it only obeys A = F/M and neither ship's velocity or KE will alter it obeying A = F/M.  Just maybe continuously accelerative CofE is not valid, especially as it has never been tested in a continuously accelerating ship obeying only A = F/M.  Or we have a CofE Paradox."
EmDrive,3bxm9q,impedance_is_futile_,3,Sun Jul 5 06:41:25 2015 UTC,"Perhaps it means the ship won't accelerate at all. That'd solve the ""paradox"" nicely.

I don't see any questions in your post, only repetitions of your usual statements that completely ignore the facts that have been presented in the posts you are replying to.   By Shawyer's own numbers, his probe gains MUCH more kinetic energy than the energy that can be provided by the generator. This FACT has been pointed out to you many times and you always ignore it. It's easy to talk when you choose to ignore the hard numbers that contradict your claims."
EmDrive,3bxm9q,wallofwolfstreet,0,Sun Jul 5 07:38:31 2015 UTC,"You see we have a Paradox.  The ship will continually accelerate as per A = F/M consuming a constant amount of energy from the ships electrical power supply per unit of time.   An external fixed velocity observer will observe the ship's KE growing as per KE = 1/2MV2.  So we have a Paradox because as far as we know both equation are correct.   However KE = 1/2MV2 has not yet been proven to apply to a ship continuously accelerating using energy from it's own power supply.  I hope to collect data on this potential Paradox using my EMDrive rotary test rig, which will allow accelerations of many minutes to occur. Both KE and power supply energy used will be measured and compared."
EmDrive,3bxm9q,Tbone139,2,Sun Jul 5 07:59:05 2015 UTC,"So, your argument is that the kinetic energy formula doesn't apply to the EmDrive? I thought you were claiming that no new physics is required to explain it. What you are proposing now is in obvious contradiction with some of the most fundamental physics. This doesn't mean that it can't be true but to pretend that such an explanation doesn't violate the currently known laws is absurd. Are you acknowledging now that fundamentally new physics is required?  And how would that work anyway? Do you think the ship somehow remembers how much energy has been used by its power supply and magically adjusts its kinetic energy so that no violation occurs regardless of its velocity?"

EmDrive,3bxm9q,victorplusplus,4,Sun Jul 5 12:21:05 2015 UTC,There is a need for the ZPF because you need to address the kinetic energy. Leaving that part of the problem unsolved means the whole emdrive is unexplained.
EmDrive,3bxm9q,victorplusplus,0,Fri Jul 3 06:55:37 2015 UTC,"What will stop the ship continuously accelerating according to A = F/M? It's systems do not care about velocity nor KE, which are only relevant to a observer on a different frame of reference and not to the ship."
EmDrive,3bxm9q,victorplusplus,-3,Sun Jul 5 07:03:25 2015 UTC,"Do you think the constantly accelerating ship will care that it's KE, to some observer on a different frame of reference, has appeared to break CofE to the observer?  It will not care as only A = F/M matters to it."
EmDrive,3bxm9q,dingoperson2,8,Fri Jul 3 03:28:26 2015 UTC,"Kinetic energy is not invariant, in that observers will not agree on the kinetic energy of an object from different inertial reference frames.  COE however, is obeyed in all inertial reference frames.  You are confusing these two concepts by bringing up this idea of the ship ""not caring"" if some other frame has the appearance of breaking COE.    There is no such thing as:   Do you think the constantly accelerating ship will care that it's KE, to some observer on a different frame of reference, has appeared to break CofE to the observer?   If COE is broken in one inertial frame of reference, then it is broken in all.  There is zero reason or meaning to invoking different frames of reference here."
EmDrive,3bxm9q,Sledgecrushr,0,Fri Jul 3 04:15:13 2015 UTC,My point was the ship only obeys A = F/M.  KE has no value to the ship nor will it effect A = F/M.  Tell me what do you think will stop the ship breaking CofE as it continually accelerates?
EmDrive,3bxm9q,zurael,8,Fri Jul 3 04:19:52 2015 UTC,"Tell me what do you think will stop the ship breaking CofE as it continually accelerates?   Nothing.  As far as I can tell nothing would stop the ship form accelerating up the velocity at which it produces more power than it consumes.  That's the issue.  COE is as strong a law of physics as they come, so anything that goes against that will justifyingly be subjected to massive skepticism.  As the emdrive theories stand right now, the emdrive is a free energy machine.  That's a bit of a problem in my eyes."
EmDrive,3bxm9q,See-Shell,-2,Fri Jul 3 04:24:37 2015 UTC,"Eagleworks showed 6 devices that produce Force without using propellants:  https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B7kgKijo-p0iaU1mb0ZJcW01MUE/view?usp=sharing  This is not just a EMDrive issue. All 6 devices can also continuously accelerate and so can potentially accelerative violate CofE.  As for claiming it is a Free Energy device, would like to see anyone capture that ""Free"" KE. BTW hooking it to a generator, will stop constant acceleration and just channel power supply energy into turning the generators rotor at a constant RPM. No Free Energy there."

The reason they are so prominent and not a dead end is because dark energy and matter is basically explaining why things have their mass.  It explains on a subatomic level the coupling of energy-mass, it can unite the weak force that holds all matter together and electromagnetism as well.  We already know that the energy field called the Higgs-Boson exists in nature.  It has since the beginning, but are now using the LHC experiments to explain new particles and how much mass those particles obtain in a fraction of a second.

They'd be right too, because that is impossible. Agreed?  Now, back to reality:  Shawyer made a device that he demonstrated, both in person to colleagues and even made a video back in 2006.  Ok, I suppose he could have faked it.  But, at least 15 laboratories and individuals have constructed similar devices and many achieved similar results.  That still didn't convince me at this point.  Now, I realize how unpopular some people feel about the Traveller, but it was actually his comments on this thread and NSF that has inspired me to investigate what others have recorded. I am not convinced of anything at this point, other than the FACT that there is some sort of phenomena occurring causing some sort of thrust or movement in a particular direction.  To say otherwise would be counterintuitive to the number of people and organizations (including NASA, Boeing/DARPA) that have taken interest and recorded thrust for themselves.   I call you a troll sir, because you have decided not to investigate, read, or theorize ANYTHING.

It doesn't help that traveller spams this subreddit without considering other points of view.   Chinese research is full of falsified data and shoddy peer-review.   Boeing stated they stopped their efforts and nobody knows how invested they really were. No license came out of it, as wallofwolfstreet showed by disclosing how indebted Shawyer's company is.  NASA has presented the best experiments yet. They controlled for much more sources of error than anyone else. They also reported much smaller thrust than the Chinese or Shawyer, probably because they are better scientists.   Now everyone is waiting for them to develop a higher powered drive to test in hard vacuum in another facility. Until then, it is not clear at all if the EmDrive works. The much debated CoM and CoE violations contribute to this skepticism.  Now pointing this out and debating it is not being a troll. It's also not antagonizing anyone. It is just taking the skeptic position and as long as it doesn't derail discussion, it contributes to this subreddit."

Battery technology would need to have major breakthoughs if you want these flying cars to have decent range. 2015's Eagleworks tests have measured about 5.4 µNewtons per watt.  A honda civic weighs 2754 lbs or 1249 kilograms.   On Earth's surface, one kg exerts 9.81 N down, so it would take about 12,253 newtons to lift a honda civic. At 5.4 µN per watt, it would take 2.27 GIGAWATTS to keep a civic off the ground. That is 10% more than the peak energy of the hoover dam to keep a car in the air."

What you are functionally saying is that we can never use airplanes to transport people because the Wright Brothers only went 103 feet.   Technology usually starts at a very, very inefficient level and then we improve upon it as our understanding improves.   EMdrive at gen2 levels (if indeed it's possible), have been stated at 40+Newtons in the superconducting version.  If you think that the basest, most primitive form of a tech that is barely even in its infancy will be it's highest attainable level then yes, flying cars will never happen.

Even if cars could safely contain a supercooled,superconducting EmDrive (multiple, for steering purposes) they wouldn't be flying cars as we know them from science fiction. Airplanes are a great flying technology, but they are limited to commercial airline companies, with professional pilots flying people around. This is partly because it would be too dangerous to let untrained citizens operate a flying vehicle that is not restricted to roads. It is also not economical on the part of the manufacturers. Why sell directly to people, where you only get money once per plane, when you can sell to airline companies, which provide a constant source of income through air fares. Even if (and when) we have the tech for flying cars, they will likely not be the jetsons or bttf, but instead, kindof a corporate taxi service heavily regulated by the FAA. This is not pessimism, just questioning whether these particular ideas put forth by 60s and 70s science fiction, are the way things will really play out.

When I say the necessity for flying cars is low, I am not talking about everyone's childhood yearning for them brought on by sci fi movies, I am talking about their ability to revolutionize the economy; to make or break companies; to solve more problems than they create.

Automated flying cars, however, while much further down the line, (think of all the variables to be juggled by the program, like fluid dynamics of the air) could possibly be privately owned.

The Wright brothers airplane shares absolutely nothing with an F-22 other than the fact that they both use bernoulli's principle in order to generate lift.   It should be pretty obvious that a flying car imagined in the 60's would look different then a flying car designed in the 2020's.  If it follows the following criteria I would imagine it is about as close to a ""flying car"" as sci-fi writers could ever hope to have come:  -Seats an average household (4ish people)  -Financially attainable by a large portion of the populace  -compact enough to easily fit into urban areas  -personal transportation (goes where you want, not following specific routes like say a bus or plane)  Hell, in certain applications (think competitions like racing), I could still see them being under personal and not automated control.

That's reminiscent of what prompted me to drop out of college.  I went to the library to look up the issue of Byte Magazine that had Lebling and Blank's original article on interactive fiction.  I was blown away by the size of their periodical collection.  They had everything from Science and Nature to the James Joyce Quarterly.  Of course, being 17 at the time, I ended up spending the whole afternoon looking at old Playboy back issues on microfiche.    Before I knew it the library was about to close for the day, so I put the fun stuff away and got down to business.  But I couldn't seem to find Byte anywhere, either on paper or microfiche.  I managed to track down the periodicals librarian before she closed up shop, and asked for help locating the December 1980 issue.  ""Sorry,"" she said.  ""We don't have that magazine.  Budget cuts, you know.""  Then WTF am I doing here?  I honestly don't remember if I lost my shit or not.   I'd like to think I didn't -- it wasn't her fault, after all -- but like I said, I was 17.

One situation involves a library not having a magazine you wanted to read and this causing you to drop out of college compared against a situation where someone can't use expensive lab equipment if they are not studying under the professors who are responsible for the labs they are contained in, which is 100% responsible policy for expensive equipment and is pretty standard.

Analogous to the train, I would be the waves, and the truncated cone will be the train, the cavity is the interior of the train. Is there something I'm missing?"

EmDrive,3buu7e,TheTravellerEMD,7,Thu Jul 2 09:44:24 2015 UTC,in the UK anything patented must work as claimed.   I'm not sure where you got that information from. According to the UK IPO a patent requires:       a description of your invention that allows others to see how it works and how it could be made    drawings to illustrate your description    legal statements that set out the technical features of your invention that are to be protected (known as ‘claims’)    a summary of all the important technical aspects of your invention (known as the abstract)    It does not require a working demonstration.

Be it his intention to discourage or encourage research I am uncertain, however it is clear from his post history that he has been working with a limited set of talking points and marketing-style factoids to try and control the narrative surrounding EM Drive.   He repeatedly appeals to the authority of secret data in defense of his arguments. He repeatedly posts the same pdf files and power point files over and over again regardless of how they are received by the community. He always answers objections with the same small set of logical fallacies as if they were copy pasted from a marketing spreadsheet. He disregards or ignores the obvious contradictions and errors in the documents he has shared with this community as well as in his own statements. We have no information about his background or his expertise aside from his supposed proprietary access to Shawyer's work. The content and attitude of his posts and comments has not changed over time in response to their mostly negative reception by the community. I.E. he doesn't seem to care what we say, he just keeps posting messages and responses with the same general pro-Sawyer theme.   Conclusion TheTravellerEMD is not acting like like an individual excited by the prospect of a new technology, but like a marketing agent paid to promote an organization on social media.

During acceleration the EMDrive obeys A = F/M.  The only Inertial reference plane of interest is that of the EMDrive and the Mass it Accelerates.

EmDrive,3bu7ez,Zouden,6,Thu Jul 2 06:55:55 2015 UTC,"For there to be no CofE violation, the effective force from the EMDrive along its thrust vector has to vary with velocity relative to the starting inertial frame for a constant input power.  Otherwise, after some time accelerating constantly, the kinetic energy of the craft would exceed the amount of energy supplied to the EMDrive and thus it becomes trivial to make a free energy machine.  Therefore your claim that the drive obeys F = MA (or A = F/M) can only hold if the drive experiences a counter force along its thrust vector that reduces the acceleration (which can be countered by increasing power to the EMDrive).  EDIT: the second table that the OP /u/TheTravellerEMD posted looks like it is saying that the effective force will vary with velocity. I haven't checked the maths.  EDIT: whoops,wrong user.  The problem is that there is no precedent in physics for what that counter force actually could be.  The tricky thing is that velocity is relative. A mass only has velocity relative to something else.  So for an mysterious opposing force to manifest before the craft's velocity exceeds the value at which its KE is greater than the energy spent by the EMDrive it means that somehow the universe has to apply laws to the mass based on which inertial frame it was in when the drive was switched on.   If EMDrive is a true propellent-less thruster (and I'm starting to become convinced it is), I can't see how it will be described without new physics.  Mike McCulloch's ""MiHsC"" (pronounced ""misc"", I believe) would conserve momentum, but locally is does violate CofE. (I am fairly certain I read somewhere that from the universe's perspective it does not globally violate CofE because the drive is effectively robbing distant matter of its kinetic energy).  His theory at least seems self-consistent.  For my unqualified armchair physicist perspective, Mike's theory looks the most promising.  Apart from that, some gravity-related theory that obeys CofM & CofE could be interesting.  Intuitively, I can imagine that  if the device is creating a negative gravitational force at the wide end and an positive gravitational force at the narrow end then the drive would move towards the small end*.  The force available to the drive for a given power would be inversely proportional to the distance to a mass to push against. I suspect this would preserve CofE and CofM, but hey, I'm just an unqualified armchair physicist, what the hell do I know?  I started making a spreadsheet to model this last weekend but I haven't finished it yet.   thrust was measured in regardless of EMDrive orientation, but if it's positive at the narrow end and negative at the wide end and you inverted the drive so the narrow end pointed down I would still expect additional thrust towards the narrow end."
EmDrive,3bu7ez,freshtonic,8,Thu Jul 2 07:34:13 2015 UTC,"Thought experiment:  There are two vehicles of equal mass, both equipped with identical EMDrives.  One vehicle (Vehicle A) is in space coasting at a fixed velocity with the EMDrive switched off. It did not use the EMDrive to achieve that velocity. Imagine it was shot from a spaceship with a great big rail gun. It doesn't matter.  The second vehicle (Vehicle B) is launched from the different spaceship some distance ahead of the first one, but under its own power using the EMDrive.  The velocity of which Vehicle A was fired from the rail gun has been carefully predetermined to be the same velocity at which Vehicle B would break CofE if it exceeds it.  The distance between the launcher space ships has been predetermined such that at break-even velocity both Vehicle A and Vehicle B are adjacent to each other.  Vehicle B then switches off its EMDrive and A & B coast along adjacent to each other at identical velocities for an arbitrary period of time.  A & B then switch on their respective EMDrives. Vehicle A accelerates forward because it has not yet reached a velocity where it would violate CofE. All KE it currently has was supplied via a railgun on a spaceship. This means it can carry on accelerating until its KE is twice that of Vehicle B's KE.  Vehicle B, however, is left in the dust. Figuratively. Its EMDrive cannot supply any more KE without violating CofE.  This is clearly an absurd situation for physics. Somehow the entire mass of Vehicle B has been deemed by the universe as having used its quota of velocity.  It's crazy that two identical vehicles coasting together at the same velocity could be treated differently by physics.  I cannot conceive of how this would be the case.  So, either:  1) violation of CofE is possible (at least locally within an inertial frame, perhaps not at the Universe scale) or 2) the drive's efficiency diminishes via an inverse square law as it puts distance between itself and any matter behind it.  There are probably other possibilities, but hey, usual disclaimer about being an armchair physicist applies."
EmDrive,3bu7ez,Zouden,6,Thu Jul 2 08:09:54 2015 UTC,"Your analysis is spot-on, and it's frustrating that we still see posts from TheTraveller denying that this problem exists."
EmDrive,3bu7ez,Zouden,-2,Thu Jul 2 10:00:07 2015 UTC,Never said there would not be an apparent CofE violation.  What I said was the ship will continually accelerate according to A = F/M. Ships velocity in reference to some external reference frame and ship's KE will not effect A = F/M.  We know on large scales CofE is not valid. Likewise for a continually accelerating propellantless ship CofE will not hold or do you suggest the CofE cops will appear in the bridge and reduce the ships acceleration.  2 options  1) A = F/M is the rule and the ship will not slow down.  2) Some unknown effect will alter A = F/M but only just as CofE is broken.  Would bet on 1 being correct.
EmDrive,3bu7ez,Zouden,3,Thu Jul 2 10:32:55 2015 UTC,"Never said there would not be an apparent CofE violation.   You said that clearly and without ambiguity:   Yes it does as a CofE violation will never happen with a EMDrive.  We know on large scales CofE is not valid.   Citation please? I've seen multiple contrary claims about large scale CofE violations in the past, but not from an authoritative source.   Likewise for a continually accelerating propellantless ship CofE will not hold or do you suggest the CofE cops will appear in the bridge and reduce the ships acceleration.   No, of course I don't propose that the ""CofE cops"" will come. I am actually saying there is zero possibility that A will remain constant for a constant force, mass and input power without violating CofE.  In other words (if the drive works as you say) then there must be a CofE violation in the local frame of reference."
EmDrive,3bu7ez,Zouden,-1,Thu Jul 2 12:20:22 2015 UTC,In the local inertial reference frame the EMDrive ships only knows it's Mass and the Force that accelerates it.  In this special case applying CofE is crazy as nothing will stop the ship accelerating as per A = F/M. Neither local velocity nor KE can come into play.  It is a Paradox.
EmDrive,3bu7ez,JesusIsAVelociraptor,3,Thu Jul 2 12:28:13 2015 UTC,Why is it a paradox instead of you just being wrong?
EmDrive,3bu7ez,Zouden,-1,Thu Jul 2 13:18:06 2015 UTC,Because the EMDrive will continually accelerate following A = F/M. Neither the ships apparent velocity ref som external point of the KE will effect A = F/M.
EmDrive,3bu7ez,JesusIsAVelociraptor,2,Thu Jul 2 13:20:40 2015 UTC,"In this special case applying CofE is crazy as nothing will stop the ship accelerating as per A = F/M. Neither local velocity nor KE can come into play.   Firstly, there is no such thing as ""local velocity"". There is velocity relative to something else... and that's it.  And what do you even mean by ""applying CofE is crazy""?  Once a vehicle is over the critical CofE-violating velocity, all it needs to do is switch of the emdrive, coast to twice the distance from origin than it currently is turn around fire up the emdrive and fly back to the origin, giving it time to accelerate to CoFE violating velocity once more.  When it arrives back at origin, the vehicle will once again have a KE higher than the energy expenditure of the emdrive in the origin frame.  It's not a paradox.    Again, either:    (local) CofE violation is possible, and a lucky physicist gets to say ""Huh, whatddya know?! All of mankind's energy needs are solved forever"". (drops mic, wins Nobel Prize) or CofE is not violated, but this means force for given power cannot be constant (but even that requires new physics because it makes the origin inertial frame special).   So, IMHO, new physics is required to make EmDrive work."
EmDrive,3bu7ez,Zouden,0,Thu Jul 2 12:44:04 2015 UTC,No new physics is needed.   Just that some non tested CofE violation theory will not stop A = F/M being obeyed.  And the KE it is not a source of free energy.

EmDrive,3bu7ez,Eric1600,-1,Thu Jul 2 06:59:17 2015 UTC,"What I said was what I said.  The EMDrive is not a rocket and your need to think about it in different terms.

EmDrive,3bu7ez,kleinergruenerkaktus,11,Thu Jul 2 10:24:18 2015 UTC,"As of today I'm aware of around 15 published tests that have observed a pressure or some call it thrust when the drive is powered. It seems to me that the reality of the device to produce an thrust or better a ""push"" in one direction is out of the noise of experimental error. http://emdrive.wiki/Experimental_Results  There are currently (that we know of) around 10 different theories as to why this works. http://emdrive.wiki/Theory  This is in reality not much different than the theories on explaining black holes, dark energy, dark mass, quantum entanglement, string theories, how standard physics links to the world of quantum effects, even the simple unaccounted forces accounting for the spin on a proton can't be found, the list goes on.  This is science.  All we know and can say with conviction is we don't know. We need data to plug into these theories and even Einstein's theory E=Mc2 is continuing to garner data to it's validity.  I have my own prize pets in why it does what it does and they don't quite violate anything but I'll not be a fool and say nothing is impossible until verified, tested and we have data shooting out our arses. Data we can plug into the theories to see how the real word data we collect matches the theories and who knows maybe a whole new theory will evolve not related to anyones.   To this point I'll not argue CoE or Com or Maxwell's violation theories or try to discredit anyone attempt at a theory. I simply don't have enough data to say you're wrong and anyone who says they do just might be proven wrong somewhere down the line.  I'm just going to wait and gather information from the dozen or so builders to see where it leads. http://emdrive.wiki/Building  We are such imperfect creatures trying our damndest to see a perfectly assembled universe of quarks, gluons, vectored forces of energy, time and matter and those imperfections show in our theories in how it all works.  The only thing that is solid is data and to that point it's what the dirty dozen DIYers are trying to do. Even TheTraveler is trying, although he has faced some ridicule in his support of controversial theories from Shawyer. I too have been criticised on my build as most are/have/will be and it's no big deal.  Don't you just love science?"
EmDrive,3bu7ez,dramania,2,Thu Jul 2 11:05:33 2015 UTC,"The criticism should be expected when making people make extraordinary claims yet the evidence behind these claims is still very weak.  You can support an unproven theory and even believe it in an emotional-religious-pseudo-science sort of way, but don't expect others who are skeptical to not laugh about how emotional some people get over an unproved and radical theory.  The u/travellerEMD is over the top with calling people like me names.  I would very much love to find a way to use EM energy to create force.  However I've also worked in the RF Engineering field long enough to know how easy it is to get weird results, even for professionals with millions of dollars in equipment.  Since all these tests show very low force levels and the test beds also have high noise levels, I remain very wary of believing any of it.  Especially when we start talking about ""inertial ratcheting"".  Almost every complex unexplainable EM problem I've encountered usually has one common factor:  it's inconsistent with the physical setup.  You rotate the test device and things change.  You move it and things change.  With work this usually leads to a bad shield, a poor ground, an unexpected discontinuity in the test setup.  I've seen all these aspects in several of these setups with those willing to share those details or test other orientations.  Having more DIY people testing them really doesn't raise much hope for me because it is so easy to do something wrong and not know it when working with propagating EM waves."

I remember seeing my first microwave years ago (I know I'm dating myself) and thought ""Holy Shit!"" they want to put that into a home! That was the late 60's and I still have a lot of respect for them and a little fear. Yes, this old gal has been in engineering since those times and hopefully I garnered some engineering skills in how to make a good science experiment while using a DYI 2500 sq ft workshop.

I might even consider partnering with a lab to achieve these goals.  First step is to do basic tests to see if there is an effect at all.   There will be a double faraday cage and the Frustum's power supply will reside apx 6 feet from the frustum on the other side of the double walled faraday cage. The power leads leading to the fulcrum will be shielded and power supplied through a liquid conductor on the Fulcrum. I'll have a laser on the pivot point on the fulcrum to monitor any vibrations appearing on the SS wire supported isolated beam and shooting over the Frustum onto a graphed target. There are a few other things I've done to give be data above the noise level.

EmDrive,3bu7ez,JesusIsAVelociraptor,1 point,Fri Jul 3 19:08:00 2015 UTC,"I understand completely how costly it is.  And I think it is important for people to understand how hard it is to do rigorous testing in high frequency and high power RF.  In your case with the Faraday cage, try to set it up so you can test both in the cage and outside.  Because there could be additional Lorenz forces induced on the cage walls too.  If you can afford it, also use double or triple shielded cables with RF bypass capacitors on the ground entry and exits for the panel mounted through connectors on the cage walls.  For lower frequencies you can use cheaper ferrite materials.  I'm sure you're probably well aware of this stuff, but it might help to know a few good vendors.  Murata makes some good quality products for a wide variety of filtering, magnetic, electric, bypass, filtering, etc.  They also have some basic tutorials showing interactions and how to model/filter them.  http://www.murata.com/en-us/products/emc/emifil/knowhow/basic/chapter04-p1  I can easily see several of these modes like induction between the device under test (DUT) and the environment (Earth's Field, surrounding metal objects, etc.) creating a tiny amount of force.  Also here's a brief primer on near field probes.  I usually make and calibrate my own but you need a LNA (low noise amplifier -- assuming you have high attenuation to your signal the LNA lets you measure a wider range of attenuation) for the frequency of interest and a spectrum analyzer (and often you have to do it in a screen room to reduce the background ambient noise so the spectrum analyzer remains in its linear dynamic range).  http://www.onfilter.com/library/NEARFIELD.pdf"

EmDrive,3bu7ez,splad,2,Sat Jul 4 19:04:06 2015 UTC,"No problem, you can also use the near field probes with an LNA to test your Faraday cage.  Just make a coax antenna for your signal generator, set it outside your cage and point it at the test area.  Measure the reference field strengths (H and E) vs distance in a test area that will occupy your cage.  The put the cage in that spot and repeat the measurements with the probe inside the cage (need an LNA for this).  This will help you find leaks.  A good Faraday cage should provide 100 db of attenuation, but a homemade one will probably get to 70 db.  You can also use this method for checking your frustum.  (It goes without saying you want to do this at low power...1mW and 3' distance from generator.)  Good luck!"

EmDrive,3bu7ez,googolplexbyte,2,Thu Jul 2 11:12:51 2015 UTC,"So I have a lot of questions about this.  First off can you explain if you are talking about the group velocity or the phase velocity.  At times it seems like Shawyer and you are talking about phase velocity, then when talking about modulating the signal for ""more power"" it seems you're talking about the group velocity.  Slide 2: Lamda_g1 and Lamda_g2 are these the upper and lower cut-off resonances?  Is Lamda_o the nominal resonance?  Would you say this is strictly a physical attribute of the waveguide?  What if I pre-distort my signal to have a doppler shift and transmitted it in a square waveguide?  It would have the same physical properties as your equations require and the net thrust could be ""exchanged"" with a flat plate at the end of a waveguide.  Since many wave guides in existence carry randomly modulated signal bouncing off plates it seems your special conditions would be created all the time, everyday and would have been observed in higher power situations like with particle accelerators or microwave towers or radar systems.  Slide 3: Why limit the cut-off frequency?  It seems if you took this to a cone shape rather than a section of a cone (i.e. frustum) you would have a much larger thrust.  Slide 4: What are you saying here about A and F?  If F1=F2+F3 where is the net thrust?  Is there a missing F4 from your free body diagram?  What is the nature of the non-linear relationship?  The boundary conditions don't look non-linear to me.  Slide 5: What is meant by waveguide velocity is 0.5c?  What do you mean by open vs closed system?  I assume you're talking about this in physics energy terms.  If this is the case then this slide makes no sense to me.  Is Vg the group velocity, phase velocity or just waveguide propagation velocity?  Who measured this and how?  Also how does any of this prove the system is open?  How/where would you create a boundary to close it for analysis?  Side 6: I understand now how you think this is conserving momentum, but you need to look at the kinetic energy of these transfers.  You're pulling extra energy out of nowhere.  I don't think the relativistic mass shifts required for these energy transfers match the wavelength shifts experienced by the wave at all.  (This also applies to Slide 7)."

The effect has been demonstrated in devices that do not have the same frustum shape. Does Shawyer's explanation cover those? or are they unrelated?  Aside from that, you often say that the device continually obeys A=F/M, and the force is directly proportional to power. That also ends in a violation of conservation of energy.

For the zero side wall Force effect to happen, the Frustum needs to have spherical end plates that are a radi of the frustum vertex.  https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B7kgKijo-p0idnFGWDExNVdPZ0U/view?usp=sharing  Each of Shawyer's 1st 3 EMDrives had different dimensions and sidewall slant angles.

It's like we have some photographs of the Loch Ness Monster here - and a lot of excitement - and desire to get more cameras and people looking into it.

And as far as I am aware there are not any other companies involved although Shawyer is certainly claiming there are.   But then, a man facing hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt and looking for investors might make just such a claim I think.

(Experienced engineers)  That's really all it takes to build it.  People are literally doing it in their garages in spare time without having equipment and money around.  The videos go back a decade of time. One week of 4 competent engineers and significant reproduction would be obvious!    You really can't seem to see the obvious: The device doesn't require plutonium or something that isn't practically off the shelf.
EmDrive,3bv7ix,LoreChano,2,Thu Jul 2 19:31:47 2015 UTC,"Spend a few hours reading through old posts and you will find your arguments have all been address numerous times...  Essentially the garage tests are cheap because they use almost nothing, and they got exactly what they paid for in results..  Yes any small lab with experienced engineers could do much better, but that would require a decent budget in addition to several weeks of time of engineers who expect a healthy pay check.  The costs for experimentation grow exponentially due to the nature of the device.  And on top of all that, there is no reason to believe it works, no reliable evidence that it does, and a lot of physicists saying that it can't.  Without at least a reliable peer reviewed theory it is amazing Shawyer has gotten as much funding as he has. And nobody else really wants to foot the bill on what is probably another ftl neutrinos deal.  On the other hand several people have gotten independent positive results, all lacking proper funding and equipment to rule out all possible external causes.  The Only legitimate team working on this is NASA and they went silent after releasing a series of very promising teasers.  Perhaps it turns out to be nothing, but its not settled for certain yet."

Quantum electrodynamics is one area of physics we've tested in 1000's of applications from particle physics to astronomy to radio engineering and we've shown we have a highly accurate model.  It's considered one of the best we've ever made.  Meep is using Maxwell's field equations and solving them using finite-difference time domain analysis which is a mathematical technique that will even solve non-linear equations.  While I think Maxwell's equations in Meep aren't fully quantized versions, it's using the classical version, they are still highly accurate and much better than we could do with just trying to linearize the equations like u/timetravelerEMD spreadsheet for the frustrum does.

Trying to find a result using MEEP that contradicts conservation of momentum is as likely as, I don't know, finding one that contradicts that time is absolute. We know it isn't, not because we fidded enough with Newton's equations of kinematics, but because we did experiments that contradicted those, then Einstein found new equations that fit those results.

EmDrive,3bnzoo,bitofaknowitall,10,Tue Jun 30 19:27:13 2015 UTC,UpDate from me soon.
EmDrive,3bnzoo,TheTravellerEMD,3,Wed Jul 1 07:43:45 2015 UTC,Yay! But get well first! All us impatient internet denizens can certainly wait a month or two more.
EmDrive,3bnzoo,bitofaknowitall,2,Wed Jul 1 12:11:34 2015 UTC,Thanks. Back at home.
EmDrive,3bnzoo,TheTravellerEMD,1 point,Thu Jul 2 00:07:40 2015 UTC,That deserves an BIG upvote!
EmDrive,3bnzoo,See-Shell,1 point,Thu Jul 2 02:25:25 2015 UTC,"Thanks.  If I may suggest, just maybe you are making too many major changes before getting a basic copy cat EMDrive working?"
EmDrive,3bnzoo,TheTravellerEMD,2,Thu Jul 2 02:29:17 2015 UTC,"Sure you can and I welcome your input and respect your thoughts.  I would like to do a overview of why I believe I needed some flexibility from the primary design.    The primary design is a copy cat and this copy cat design is what I'll be testing first to gather my baseline data.  Once i have that basic data I need to gain data from other options that may or may not change the operational characteristics of the EMDrive.  I wanted to change one parameter very quickly without designing and building a whole new Frustum. You and others are or have built basic designs that are inviolate and very inflexible. If you do build a new one that new Frustum can introduce more variables in the data.  Design factors that influenced me and are known issues are.   Heat warpage of the solid copper walls changing Q.  Hot air in the frustum causing unwanted buoyancy and a possible misreading of thrust.   Antenna placement and type.  Small reflector plate distance from the large end plate.  Simply being able to see if any plasma discharges were visible within the cavity.  Trying to keep the basic form intact while allowing flexibility during later tests I opted to.  Used a perforated Copper Frustum, letting the hot air out and keeping the walls from buckling under the 800+ watts of Magnetron input and changing Q.  Split cavity.  Allows me to be able to open the Frustum and change antennas and position of the antennas, as nobody has really looked at that as a big contributor to thrust.   Also the split design allows me to pull out the small end plate and replace it to do either TM or TE  modes for testing.  The basic frustum still maintains the primary design except the perforated Copper walls for cooling but allows me to keep one basic design while being able to only change one item and to log the data.  Make sense? I understand your concern and I hope I kept the copy cat design by only changing the cooling by a perforated copper case."
EmDrive,3bnzoo,See-Shell,1 point,Thu Jul 2 03:35:22 2015 UTC,"The current SS does length variation calc to hold desired Q, At 2.45GHz, Q can be destroyed by length variation of a small fraction of a mm. My concern is your flexible design may not have a very high Q, due to it's flexibility. I feel it may be quite low. Here I mean loaded Q when the EMDrive is experiencing acceleration and building up Force bounce by bounce. I also feel unloaded Q is a waste of time as it is only loaded / working Q that is important.  SPR's Flight Thruster I believe has a working Q of at least 100k and not the published 50k unloaded Q. Look at how firm those end plates are held as even say 0.05mm length variation will destroy a 100k Q.  Read this: http://www.emdrive.com/IAC13paper17254.v2.pdf Section 2. Does the best job in explaining how Force is built up bounce by bounce and why high Q is so important and vital."
EmDrive,3bnzoo,TheTravellerEMD,2,Thu Jul 2 03:44:45 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your input, I do value it.   I've just fried my brain on reading a great paper from MIT even considering my math skills felt like pidgin math. :) after. Good paper and I highly recommend it. http://web.mit.edu/22.09/ClassHandouts/Charged%20Particle%20Accel/CHAP12.PDF  I've read Rodger Shawyer's paper and while I believe there is much to discuss on the reasons why he has seen thrust. I don't dispute the need for building a stable Q and exciting and maintaining the desired Mode for the cavity. Also there maybe some questions of Q considering Yang's high thrust with lower Q factor.  While I think it's import to have a cavity that is to exact dimensions. I feel the variation of the length by less than 1/2 the thickness of a piece of paper controlling a high Q factor (.05mm) will be subject to the thermal expansion coefficient of the copper Frustum with even a minor temperature increase (tec of Copper 16.6 wiki source) it will deviate enough to change Q.  The question to me is not so much trying to control the dimensionality, but the frequency as well.   I chose a Magnetron because of it's wide spectral transmission centered around 2.45 Ghz and being forgiving in delivering power into a variable expanding and contracting cavity. Not a perfect solution but it should work to give me some base data.  I have a heavy structural heat fin design design in the works for the endplate (similar to the CPU cooling systems you see) that can be coupled  to the other endplate using Stainless threaded rod, but only after I've verified with my design the cavity dimensions, mode selections and power factor.  I originally wanted to do a stepper motor feedback and control to adjust the cavity length on the fly using a small loop wire in the cavity.  I don't believe it's going to be responsive enough. So eventually I'll be controlling the frequency of the magnetron with a feedback loop by monitoring the Q within the cavity.  I would recommend reading the MIT paper because it covers the steps needed for maintaining high Q in particle accelerators. Hey while your SO has you strapped down in the bed resting, it's a good read."
EmDrive,3bnzoo,See-Shell,0,Thu Jul 2 05:51:01 2015 UTC,"Really do wish you all the very best of luck.   Just my research shows there are a lot of real world practical issues in getting a good working on load Q that the theory guys on NSF have not even considered.  Look even getting an on load cavity Q of 5k may be really difficult unless you have done this as many times as Shawyer had done when he designed the Boeing Flight Thruster, which consider a very high quality design and implementation.  I can tell, looking at the Boeing Flight Thruster, all the experience that went into making that a solid unit."

EmDrive,3botkm,F4cele55,8,Tue Jun 30 22:55:51 2015 UTC,"Well, one of the reasons people disbelieve Emdrive, is exactly because it would make this sci-fi ships possible, if it works as is speculated. I think no one really knows if size matters, of if efficiency would be affected with multiple drives."
EmDrive,3botkm,LoreChano,7,Wed Jul 1 00:54:18 2015 UTC,"Ok so for purposes of this wild speculation, let's assume Shawyer's crazy numbers of something like 300N/kW.  With this, you could literally lift anything into orbit given enough power and emdrives.  So why use a standard ""ship"" design at all? I'm thinking of something like what's alluded to at the end of Interstellar.  We could just hollow out a very large mountain and launch that in to space.  Or put a dome over the city of Detroit, and send it to Mars."
EmDrive,3botkm,bitofaknowitall,7,Wed Jul 1 12:25:39 2015 UTC,"Now that's plain silly, send Detroit to Mars, you know Cleveland has first dibs on that ride."

EmDrive,3botkm,BluntlySays,3,Thu Jul 2 08:55:55 2015 UTC,http://emdrive.wiki/File:EMDrivePodsx10.jpg  I like this...
EmDrive,3botkm,See-Shell,3,Wed Jul 1 01:44:25 2015 UTC,"I don't understand why they are exposed.  Seems to me that since there is no propellant expelled, it would be better to have them contained internally so you can perform maintenance easier."
EmDrive,3botkm,bitofaknowitall,5,Wed Jul 1 12:27:43 2015 UTC,"Agree. Having them within the pressurized hull makes much easier to give them maintenance (no need to go out and thus no need of space suits).  This is a residue of the old ways of thinking going over and tainting our imaginations. Things would likely look very different in reality (if it ever becomes reality).  Like how people at the beginnings of motorized wheeled vehicles imagined them as horseless carriages and not as modern cars.  Probably ships of the future based on this or similar technology would tend to have as much machinery inside their pressurized hulls as possible.  If someone invents a safe, powerful energy source (e.g. LENR), that fact would accentuate this tendency even further. Resulting in ships that don't look as we usually depict them in science fiction."
EmDrive,3botkm,tchernik,3,Wed Jul 1 15:35:36 2015 UTC,"Heat maybe, or it simply looks cool, better than in a box shaped ship drawing, no, no not the Borg."
EmDrive,3botkm,See-Shell,2,Wed Jul 1 15:30:05 2015 UTC,"Once we understand how it works, the shape of the drive will probably change as optimizations are made... honestly, the shape of the space ship could be anything... the drives will be hidden inside because they don't need to expel propellant so there is no reason for them to be exposed!"
EmDrive,3botkm,pacificmaelstrom,3,Wed Jul 1 01:17:13 2015 UTC,"We might not need to fully understand it to harness its potential. Think about aircraft. For a long time, scientists and engineers debated what produces the lift that makes the planes fly. It didn't prevent engineers to create a very practical machine. They kept testing and evolving it until it produced the required result.   The same thing can happen with the EmDrive. If a solid proof is there, money will flow and 1000 test articles will be produced and an optimal design will be chosen. Maybe there will be more designs for specific use cases.  The drive design indeed allows wild spaceship designs to exists. For some daydreaming see: http://www.merzo.net/index.html"
EmDrive,3botkm,kowdermesiter,2,Wed Jul 1 02:07:18 2015 UTC,"Not exactly. You need to get rid of all the heat, so the ship will require huge radiators."
EmDrive,3botkm,Magnesus,2,Wed Jul 1 08:51:42 2015 UTC,"If the emdrives are strong enough to lift a ship against gravity, then they're strong enough for practical energy production.   Your ship can be built around two large counterrotating disks, spun up by emdrives on the edges. On the central axle, a generator gets enough power to run the edge drives, plus additional internal drives to move the whole ship. For operation in atmosphere you'd want to streamline the whole thing, giving you a saucer shape."
EmDrive,3botkm,ItsAConspiracy,3,Wed Jul 1 16:52:41 2015 UTC,If we can get enough propulsion I can really see a retrofitted nuclear submarine fulfilling all of the necessary prerequisites for a quick spacecraft fairly easily.  But Im a cheap bastard too.
EmDrive,3botkm,Sledgecrushr,4,Wed Jul 1 17:11:05 2015 UTC,"Yep me too. If >1G were to happen quickly I could see that happening first. Wouldn't it be funny if the first manned mission to Mars were in a submarine.  Within the atmosphere, flying nuclear aircraft carriers."
EmDrive,3botkm,ItsAConspiracy,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:21:23 2015 UTC,That is an interesting idea for power source. Though a machine generating its own power while having energy to spare would be fun explaining. I'll doodle on it tonight though.
EmDrive,3botkm,ItsAConspiracy,2,Wed Jul 1 18:10:07 2015 UTC,"We've had a lot of discussion about the physics of that. The device would have constant thrust for a constant input energy, giving it constant acceleration. But kinetic energy increases with the square of velocity, so at some velocity you're getting more energy out than you put in.   The more thrust you get per input energy, the lower that crossover velocity is, and with sufficient thrust to lift a vehicle in Earth's gravity that velocity is low enough for a feasible flywheel to make excess energy.  Of course this is one reason that many physicists doubt the device actually works. But if it does work it violates our normal understanding of conservation of momentum anyway, and conservation of energy isn't any worse. Either way, something in our theories of physics will have to change.  Anyway, I'd love to see whatever you come up with."
EmDrive,3botkm,flux_capacitor78,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:21:10 2015 UTC,"But what if the EmDrive, as already suggested before, had some growing resistance against its proper acceleration, limiting its practical velocity (hence the kinetic energy) to a fraction of what the electric power generator can supply? Then it would be a perfect lift engine (as in Star Wars) but not a complete rocket replacement."
EmDrive,3botkm,ItsAConspiracy,4,Wed Jul 1 19:09:24 2015 UTC,"You mean like, the faster it goes, the less the acceleration? Then instead of violating conservation of energy, you're violating the principle of relativity, which says there's no such thing as absolute velocity. There's only velocity relative to something else (hence ""relativity""). So you have an infinite number of velocities. But you can only have one thrust.  Could be Einstein was wrong about that, but then it's a pretty big coincidence that atom bombs work.  Either way something in physics will have to change, if the emdrive actually works. (If it does work, my guess is that McCulloch is on the right track.)"
EmDrive,3botkm,flux_capacitor78,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:14:36 2015 UTC,"Yes you're right. Does McCulloch predicts a constant acceleration at constant power, or the scheme where the acceleration is limited?"
EmDrive,3botkm,ItsAConspiracy,6,Wed Jul 1 19:25:43 2015 UTC,"Constant acceleration. He says the excess energy comes from the zero-point field.   And he has one blog post saying we used to have conservation of mass and conservation of energy as separate laws, then Einstein unified them to conservation of mass-energy. Now we have that plus conservation of information, and he speculates that the true law is conservation of mass-energy-information. But I don't think he's developed that into actual math.  He does have math predicting emdrive performance, which says superconducting emdrives would be much more powerful."
EmDrive,3botkm,TheRedFireFox,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:38:11 2015 UTC,"but wouldn't the maximum speed (of the drive) limit be under the speed of a single electro magnetic impulse (wave)? (Sorry but to my understanding from what I know, it's the impulses that push the drive, so the speed limit would be a bit below the speed of a single impulse) (sorry if I am totally wrong I don't understand much of physic)"
EmDrive,3botkm,tidux,1 point,Thu Jul 2 09:25:55 2015 UTC,"Nobody knows what pushes the drive, because it's not emitting anything other than a bit of waste heat.  That's why we get all these weird hypotheses like ""it's pushing off the quantum vacuum"" or ""it's warping space.""  You're describing a photon thruster, which is different."
EmDrive,3botkm,ItsAConspiracy,1 point,Thu Jul 2 09:52:26 2015 UTC,"Yep! That's the speed of light, which nothing can exceed. But the way that works is pretty weird. As you get closer to lightspeed, time slows down for you. To you it appears that you're accelerating normally, but to someone back on Earth it looks like you're getting closer and closer to lightspeed but never quite reaching it."
EmDrive,3botkm,SmokeMathHeilSatin,1 point,Thu Jul 2 12:56:46 2015 UTC,"imagine a cube with a power source and an EMdrive in the middle, able to be oriented in any direction.  imagine millions of these joined together into a megastructure that can accelerate just as rapidly as a single unit.  due to the way the EMdrive operates, the direction of thrust is not tied to the direction of expulsion of waste heat/exhaust like a propellant-based propulsion system.  this means as long as you can adequately dispose of waste heat, there is no size limit to the megastructures you can create (aside from avaliability of building materials), there is only a mass limit defined by how big the structure can be before its own gravitational field crushes it.  ""death star"" sized ships could become theoretically possible, along with many other space megastructures shown in science fiction.  another, more exciting possibility is nanoEMdrives, which use visible light wavelengths and could potentially make hoverboards (and many other things) a reality."
EmDrive,3botkm,drakesdoom,1 point,Fri Jul 3 14:22:21 2015 UTC,"Unless multiple breakthroughs happen the em drive will never be a primary drive for manned ships.  It could be a primary drive on probes or a low power maneuvering drive to hold position.    For it to be a main drive would require 3 breakthroughs. Fully understand it, scalability, and power to thrust efficiency."
EmDrive,3botkm,cornelius2008,3,Wed Jul 1 00:17:07 2015 UTC,Understanding is not required for use.
EmDrive,3botkm,Vaebn,7,Wed Jul 1 05:00:02 2015 UTC,Thats what they said for Event Horizon too.
EmDrive,3botkm,tchernik,2,Wed Jul 1 09:15:11 2015 UTC,"Event Horizon is a Hollywood fantasy. And one with the usual elements of Greek tragedy: the hubris of science, opening up places and realms it shouldn't really touch, being eventually and unfailingly punished.  But the forbidden thing instead of being the forbidden apples of the garden of Eden, or the view of naked Artemis, it's what relativity says you shouldn't do.  By the way: I rooted for Weir, at least until the point where he goes eye-gouging crazy."
EmDrive,3botkm,Magnesus,-1,Wed Jul 1 22:24:24 2015 UTC,"Understanding it will not be that hard once it is confirmed and proven to work. People will just test every possible combination and compare to all available theories and their predictions. If there was more experimental data, we would probably have better theories already."
EmDrive,3botkm,drakesdoom,3,Wed Jul 1 08:53:20 2015 UTC,I listed that not because it is hard but because we cannot judge if the other two or possible before doing that.
EmDrive,3botkm,flux_capacitor78,0,Wed Jul 1 15:20:33 2015 UTC,"When using higher operational frequencies within the resonator, the size of the cavity decreases. You would think about stacking several of them together. But if the EmDrive could be scaled up to much higher frequencies, the cavity dimensions would be reduced in the millimeter-range, or even less. That way the engine could be spread over the entire volume of the spaceship structure, inside it, everywhere. The structure would be made of nanothrusters. Then nobody can locate the engine, because the ship is the engine ;)  I imagine a situation where an alien saucer working on that principle would crash on Earth, letting everyone mystified after some high ranked officer ordered valuable scientists to discover and understand how the thruster works, and the scientists could not even locate it! :D"
EmDrive,3botkm,Henator,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:25:52 2015 UTC,That is an awesome description.  I thought for a moment about making the entire ship the cavity. So people live inside the engine. But that would probably be harmfull.

EmDrive,3bmbpk,LoreChano,3,Tue Jun 30 14:43:38 2015 UTC,"The main difference is the shape. Em is a truncated cone, Cannae is disk shaped; this is the Cannae device tested at Nasa."
EmDrive,3bmbpk,Rowenstin,1 point,Tue Jun 30 17:47:01 2015 UTC,I think that the Emdrive is a single cone shaped device whilst the Cannae drive is in a multiple configuration - I'm not a science guy but I think both of them claim to be propellant-less devices which produce thrust....
EmDrive,3bmbpk,ZephirAWT,0,Fri Jul 3 15:17:09 2015 UTC,The difference between Em and Cannae drive is similar to difference between normal and Fresnel lens - the Cannae drive replaces one large cone with many small and low profile ones: it's momentum/volume ratio is therefore more advantageous (EM drive tends to be bulky).
EmDrive,3bo5ne,pacificmaelstrom,5,Tue Jun 30 19:58:58 2015 UTC,Wouldn't that be a case of this: http://prntscr.com/7naa29 ? because the part with more gravity is atracting the side with less mass with the same force that the side with less mass is atracting the side with more gravity
EmDrive,3bo5ne,Ponjkl,2,Tue Jun 30 21:22:33 2015 UTC,"I dont think so. The mass is produced by the dense em waves which are resonating in the cavity. The idea is that spacetime has ""mass"" based on the density of energy at a given location. Since the position of the high energy regions is determined by the resonance properties of the cavity, the regions will ""move"" ahead of the CG as it moves towards them, and they are constantly being renewed by the incoming radiation."
EmDrive,3bo5ne,TortugaTerritory,4,Tue Jun 30 22:58:01 2015 UTC,"... Could less densely packed energy, such as EM waves in resonance also produce a gravitational effect?   I think everything before and up to this is true and already established.  The problem with your theory is that gravity effects points in space in pairs, equally and inversely, so that no net thrust is attained."

EmDrive,3bo5ne,reading-spaghetti,4,Tue Jun 30 22:58:11 2015 UTC,"Just because the energy density peaks at a certain spot in the cavity does not mean that new gravity comes into existence.  A bucket of sand has the same gravitational pull as that same amount of sand spread out over the floor, it's just arranged differently.  The same thing happens in the cavity.  The energy producing gravity existed before it became focused and exists after it passes through that spot.  The center of gravity doesn't change, the arrangement of energy is just different  I am not a physicist, so take this with a grain of salt.  If this isn't what you meant, then please ignore."
EmDrive,3bo5ne,bitofaknowitall,1 point,Tue Jun 30 23:20:37 2015 UTC,"If you pile the sand asymmetrically then the center of gravity can change according to how the sand is piled. Since the energy is asymmetrical in the cavity, its center of gravity is at a different location then that of the cavity.   Then, since the space-time that the waves are in are not fixed relative to the cavity, they can move towards each other, causing the cavity to move forward a little. Then a new resonance is set up based on the new location of the cavity and the process repeats continuously.   I'm sorry if I am not explaining this very well."
EmDrive,3bo5ne,The_Music,2,Wed Jul 1 00:13:39 2015 UTC,"The answer to this lies in Newton's laws - for every action, an opposing reaction. The energy will pull on the device - but the device also pulls on the energy, creating a net force of zero. No matter what form it's in, mass/energy is affected by gravity."
EmDrive,3bo5ne,Tbone139,2,Wed Jul 1 21:27:58 2015 UTC,Is this sort of like StrongGR's theory?  His was so math-heavy that I couldn't follow it.  But I recall the end result was he showed the resulting force would not be enough to explain the effects observed in the EmDrive.

EmDrive,3bi9kz,andresni,9,Mon Jun 29 14:00:50 2015 UTC,"kml then began reporting the results of his experimental measurements. Recall that he is testing an enclosed rectangular waveguide with a dielectric, NOT a frustum design. His tests showed thrust both with and without a dielectric, and without any contact with the scale!. So the most likely conclusion from this test was Rf interference with the digital scale. kml the reran the tests and found with a lighter load and the device not touching the scale, the scale didn't register any weight change. He also ran the tests in a ""down"" configuration and still saw the scale ""lose"" weight. Theoretically the scale should have gained weight in this orientation if there was any thrust. An annotated photo of kml's test device can be found here   This is not surprising in the least. Hopefully it is a lesson to others about the importance of controls and having a robust apparatus."

As has been pointed out, the total dollar amount is chump change for something with the theoretical potential of EMdrive.  The lesson is that he has so little evidence of the drive working, that he's been unable to raise any real money.  The eternal optimist in me hopes that he's just a lousy businessman and experimental scientist who stumbled into something real that will be verified by others.  But he is his own worst enemy from a credibility standpoint."
EmDrive,3bf562,mittelhauser,4,Sun Jun 28 21:36:37 2015 UTC,You have worded my thoughts better than I could have done so myself.
EmDrive,3bf562,YugoReventlov,17,Mon Jun 29 08:29:21 2015 UTC,"I'm not a big financial analyst, but as a researcher currently in the academia, I can say that $950,000 is not a lot of money at all. DARPA and other entities grants 500K+ to faculty to do 4 years projects and many of them don't even produce good results. I'm not in favor or against SPR, but $950,000 is a very small amount of money if we take into consideration that we are talking about rocket propulsion here, also the time distribution is wide, it's not something that have happened in 3 years, it have been around for a while."
EmDrive,3bf562,victorplusplus,3,Sun Jun 28 18:06:30 2015 UTC,"It is wrong to base anything on claims, as anybody can claim anything. Results need to dictate the decisions, failing results, a sound theoretical reasoning should support the viability of the technology.  The EM drive does not require a large amount of resources to construct, a higher power model which would dispel all doubt is beyond feasible. It is also more than possible that SPR has already constructed such a model in hopes of proving out the idea, but it's lack of published and repeatable experimental data speaks volumes as to the efficacy of the em drive.  I think it's import to understand the dynamics at play here. The EM drive is a very sexy dream, a device that would open up the heavens to humanity, it's appeal is not scientific(since it's operation has no basis on currently understood physics), but emotional. We should not let something that appeals to our emotions cloud our judgement, and just because it would be really great if the thing work doesn't speak at all to the possibility of it actually working. In fact, all the hard science points to this not working.  Make no mistake, this happens all the time in science. Cold fusion, faster-than-light neutrinos, easily mass produced steam cells, the list goes on and on. In the end, extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence, and the evidence for the EM drive falls far should of extraordinary."

The youtuber who posted videos certainly tried but he just couldn't afford to get actual equipment to do a legitimate test.  the Hackaday group is still trying but is running into very similar problems.   And this doesn't even go into how many wrong turns Shawyer is likely to have taken as he has experimented.
EmDrive,3bf562,Eric1600,15,Mon Jun 29 01:49:41 2015 UTC,"That's chump change.  15 years and 1 million is only $67k a year.  Spread that across any employees and fixed costs and you've got nothing for test equipment, software, and any machine shop or custom parts.   Considering he is trying to make some superconducting wave guides now, that's really not enough money to do anything.  If he had a budget of more like $1 million a year, then you might have a point that they should have better test rigs and more clear results.  But what they have is a good low budget effort and some youtube videos."
EmDrive,3bf562,ProxyCola,-2,Sun Jun 28 19:39:34 2015 UTC,"why does everyone assume he's funding this on his own? he claims he has partnerships with some big corporations with invested interest. my guess is he's gonna have everything he needs to create superconducting wave guides, without paying for it out of SPR's pocket."
EmDrive,3bf562,mittelhauser,12,Sun Jun 28 19:45:44 2015 UTC,"Because there is no evidence he has ANY deals with big corporations and a lot of evidence against it.  I posted a brief analysis of one of his ""investment prospectus"" documents to the NSF forum a couple of days ago.  It was a joke.  Full of complete red flags to any experienced investor.  If he had deals with major corporations, he wouldn't have been trying to sell shares of his company at $20k/share with little to no justification for the valuation.    There is also NO way any intelligent corporation could have deals without getting IP protection and he doesn't have any.  Provisional patents are not that hard to come by."
EmDrive,3bf562,nspectre,6,Sun Jun 28 21:32:07 2015 UTC,"Bingo.  With the time I have spent looking into SPR, I very much doubt it has any sort of deal setup with any organization, whether it be a government, corporation or anything else.  If SPR [i]does[/i] have some deal:  1)They haven't been paid for it.  2)They have no legal structure for it (no formal partnership, etc)  3) They haven't attempted to leverage said deal for any additional financing, despite holding significant debt, zero cash and no revenue stream.

I imagine a company that thinks it can make a lot of money selling the space engines of the future by patenting them. This company, however, fails to realize that rocket scientists have not historically patented their inventions and instead traditionally opt to work in secret because a patent guarantees someone will steal your designs.  It certainly looks like a business that is failing to generate revenue, but it also looks like they might do exactly that with or without a working prototype. A million dollars is practically nothing for a corporation like this to spend over 15 years. Tons of startups burn through way more money in way less time and I'd guess more than half of them have failed even though they had viable products."

The changes in the experiment required to test this thesis are so minor as to require little more than the application of the physical nudge and a slight change in measurement protocols to reflect that nudge.  What I find odd is how you will go to such lengths to discourage people from doing this; such labor. It occurs to me that the labor you expend discouraging people from trying this experimental paradigm might be better spent on your own experiments.  How are those going btw?"

The effort I spend on this discussion is minimal and takes nothing out of my day.  And the idea that you have to nudge the emdrive to make it generate force sounds a lot like it doesn't actually generate force.   If you push on it then that will upset any data collected because any outside viewer will assume that that force measured is a result of that nudge and has nothing to do with the drive.  If this idea turns out to be correct, then Shawyer is on it and he will prove it soon enough. If it is not, then it disrupts tests, damages credibility of the results, and makes everybody look like fools.  You realize the main argument I have against this theory, by the way, is that it comes from a very unreliable source at best.  Surely it is worth mentioning as a ""This is how Shawyer believes the drive works"" sort of thing, but to present it as a fact that should be included in experimentation is clearly absurd."

The diesel fuel in your truck that does not ignite without a spark and compression. I wont even get started on this; there are just too many instances of energy systems in stasis that do interesting things when their stasis is disturbed or perturbed.  ""If you push on it then that will upset any data collected because any outside viewer will assume that that force measured is a result of that nudge and has nothing to do with the drive.""  This is the other half of the adjustment that needs to be made to the experiment; measuring the 'nudge' and subtracting it from the data gathered by the instruments.  ""If this idea turns out to be correct, then Shawyer is on it and he will prove it soon enough.""  This idea came from Shawyer. He just didn't bother emphasizing it to anyone until just recently. Certainly I didn't catch it, and I haven't seen where in any of the 'independent' attempts to duplicate his results that it is implemented in the experimental protocol. Why did he let this slip under everyone's radar? I don't know. Maybe it was a prank; maybe an oversight; maybe he is just a prick. In any event, you cannot hope to duplicate his results without duplicating his experiments. That means you have to do it like he did, or it isn't the same experiment.  EDIT: Correct the Typonese"

Assuming that the drive operates in a way that relates to the Casimir effect of quantum fluctuations. In that case then I don't understand all the criticisms about breaking conservation of momentum or thermodynamics.  If the extant universe contains virtual particles that wink in and out of existence and if a device could extract useful work from those particles when they are observable, then any imbalances would be balanced in the place where those particles exist when they are not here, even if that place is only virtual.   If virtual particles are real then the observable universe is in a steady state rather than equilibrium.

I was up till 3am last night reading and trying to work out this idea I have like a old dog with a bone and it's a tough bone.   In the transmission of evanescent waves (and they are around all antennas) there exists a high order force in the evanescent wave structure that carries momentum and longitudinal spin determined by the wave vector and circular polarization, respectively it is proven that these waves are not virtual and I think they can present a high order hook into the quantum vacuum providing thrust by pushing against those virtual particles.  A virtual particle in the Quantum Vacuum is a disturbance in a field that is something that is caused by the presence of other particles and their associated fields and an evanescent wave with it's high order actions can create a virtual particle and interact with it.  This is similar to Dr. Whites EMDrive generating a virtual particle jet within the cavity but not the same, as I think the effects arise from the evanescent waves and the first order forces they carry of momentum and spin in a virtual particle."

EmDrive,3b7rg9,Eric1600,1 point,Fri Jun 26 20:04:58 2015 UTC,"Cosmological evolution is one of his main points, but from the book:   Symmetries arise from the act of treating a subsystem of the universe as if it were the only thing that existed. It is only because we ignore the interactions between the rest of the universe and the atoms in our laboratory that it doesn't matter if we move the laboratory in space...  Symmetries, such as translations and rotations, are then not fundamental; they arise from the division of the world into two parts, as described in the preceding chapter. These and other symmetries are features only of approximate laws applying to subsystems of the universe.  This has a stunning consequence: If these symmetries are approximate, then so are the laws of conservation of energy, momentum, and angular momentum. These basic conservation laws depend on the assumption that space and time are symmetric under translations in time, translations in space, and rotations....  So the unknown cosmological theory will have neither symmetries nor conservation laws.   That's from the chapter ""Principles for a New Cosmology."" He concludes the chapter:   Although we don't yet have the cosmological theory, we already know something about it, if the principles I've put forward are sound:   It should contain what we already know about nature, but as approximations... It will posit neither symmetries nor conservation laws.    However I'm not sure whether he suspects the conservation laws could be locally violated, or just violated in the cosmos as a whole, with something like inflation."
EmDrive,3b7rg9,Eric1600,2,Fri Jun 26 20:25:22 2015 UTC,"I think he is trying to imply that conservation laws and symmetries can exist, but maybe they aren't required at a fundamental level for some cases.  I don't know how much physics exposure you have, but many solutions are found assuming conservative operators.  He is implying that perhaps some of these assumed solutions are approximate if the symmetries are approximate."
EmDrive,3b7rg9,Eric1600,2,Sun Jun 28 00:57:04 2015 UTC,"Exactly. ""It should contain what we already know about nature, but as approximations."" He's certainly not just throwing them out the window.  But historically, when laws of physics turned out to be approximations of deeper laws, that often opened the door to really dramatic special cases."
EmDrive,3b3x0v,JesusIsAVelociraptor,57,Thu Jun 25 19:34:56 2015 UTC,"Science is not about convincing people what you believe, it's about presenting evidence so you don't have to."
EmDrive,3b3x0v,nekonekoneko,6,Thu Jun 25 19:57:35 2015 UTC,"That is great in theory, but science as the public has witnessed is often messy.  Results and data in and of themselves is meaningless.  Look at the gravity wave (BICEP2) detection claims from the big bang, cold fusion, etc.  Most of the messy part stays behind the lab doors and the public doesn't get to see the exposed process, which is often highly technical and jargon filled.  Presenting evidence requires you have to present your test method, your calibration, your standards, and your interpretation.  All of these then need to be repeatable and duplicated.  In the case of the gravity wave probe it took months and months to find the source of the measurement error until everyone was ""convinced"" there was a problem with the test.  Example:  Gravity waves from Big Bang in Scientific American (March 2014) http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/gravity-waves-cmb-b-mode-polarization/  Opps, no that was dust (Jan. 2015) http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/nope-we-have-not-detected-gravitational-waves-yet-180954101/?no-ist"

EmDrive,3b3x0v,aysz88,26,Sun Jun 28 01:00:47 2015 UTC,"Don't make TheTraveller or Shawyer let you down - we knew from the very beginning, Shawyer is probably a bit lost in this and if he found something it's by sheer luck and his science is laughable. It's not like anything changed today with that abstract fiasco.   DIY replication attempts and EW results should tell us before the end of the year if it's worth pursuing. I bet if there are no confirmations this year it will end up as cold fusion - close, but no cigar - but till then, I don't see why our hope should diminish in any way. And since Shawyer looks to be bankrupt (250k pounds in debt), don't expect him to make any new experiments."

We only have /u/TheTravellerEMD 's word he had access to a preview. As sad as it may seem, /u/TheTravellerEMD may have been just looking for attention (or trolling).  If it is, well, he (Roger Shawyer) just burned the last bits of credibility he had. Thankfully he isn't alone driving the research of this anymore.   And even more thankfully, he didn't do anything like this when he was making his first published experiments which actually had some data in them. Otherwise nobody would have ever done a replication."
EmDrive,3b3x0v,tchernik,1 point,Thu Jun 25 22:13:48 2015 UTC,"I never troll and there is nothing burned about my credibility.   What I said is the paper will remove all doubt. As a peer reviewed paper, what the paper's author has said, equations used and calculated results are checked to be accurate by the peer reviewers.  So what SPR reveals in the paper is without doubt accurate and correct.  I have never published any experimental data, so please stop making false statements. When I start my EMDrive tests I will publish data but that is not probably 6 weeks, at least, away as I'm recovering from prostate cancer surgery."

EmDrive,3b3x0v,tchernik,34,Thu Jul 2 00:45:28 2015 UTC,My main point is that /u/TheTravellerEMD has flooded the sub and most of the front page posts are by him and that anybody coming to this sub for the first time might end up with a very incorrect view of this sub.  Its important we not be viewed as just a fan club for Shawyer which might scare away users who might provide valuable content and bring 'actual' science to the discussion.
EmDrive,3b3x0v,Magnesus,8,Thu Jun 25 20:24:05 2015 UTC,"I agree, thanks for clarification."
EmDrive,3b3x0v,dasbeiler,3,Thu Jun 25 20:31:32 2015 UTC,"'actual' science   The seventeenth century witnessed the birth of modern science as we know it today. This science was something new, based on a direct confrontation of nature by experiment and observation. But there was another feature of the new science—a dependence on numbers, on real numbers of actual experience.   Ahhh so what Shawyer may be throwing darts and a board but he is the pioneer of the EMD as we know it. Would that not be the reason Shawyer related topics keep getting exposure? You can throw numbers around all day at the NSF forums, we still dont know much more than before the think tank. Too many ideas, variables, inaccuracies to make any sort of proper judgement beyond faith. There ARE going to be big claims until we get a solid foundation on what is going on, and what is more, is the 'if anything is going on'."
EmDrive,3b3x0v,TheTravellerEMD,1 point,Fri Jun 26 06:53:37 2015 UTC,"There is no Shawyer fan club other than he is the ONLY guy offering info to help EMDrive builders. NSF is full of theory that is not backed by even 1 successful replication, while I know Shawyer has helped many groups.  BTW the SPR theory works and has been proven."
EmDrive,3b3x0v,TheTravellerEMD,1 point,Thu Jul 2 00:42:34 2015 UTC,"See, I don't see how you can claim a theory has been proven when the majority of physicists consider it impossible. I would love for you to be right, but until I see this peer reviewed paper released and an actual clear demonstration of force I will remain skeptical.

EmDrive,3b3x0v,TheTravellerEMD,1 point,Thu Jul 2 01:47:21 2015 UTC,"The majority of physicists never actually read the papers.  I'm putting together a major effort to generate a ""Dummies Guide to the EMDrive"" which will make it very clear why it works, via a very clever effect, and that it works entirely with-in physics.   I'll back that up with an online video link to my continuously rotating EMDrive test rig. No wires, all power from batts on the rotating test rig. Around and around it will go, faster and faster until wind resistance limits further acceleration."

EmDrive,3b3x0v,Tbone139,1 point,Thu Jul 2 03:48:38 2015 UTC,You are way out of date.  Shawyer had it working in 2002. Was verified by UK gov panel of 7 British Aerospace companies and experts.
EmDrive,3b3x0v,TheTravellerEMD,3,Thu Jul 2 04:00:09 2015 UTC,"If this was settled in 2002 why in the hell is it 2015 and still a question? Why have we not yet seen any emdrive powered vehicles? Why is shawyers company as of 2014 in debt and producing no income?   Why has the UK who you claim has agreed that this drive works, not announced any plans to use the drive in any way? Wouldn't a government with as much wealth and security as the UK be the opportune party to experiment with such technology?"
EmDrive,3b3x0v,NicknameUnavailable,1 point,Thu Jul 2 06:24:06 2015 UTC,"I can't comment on SPR or the UK gov.  You have no idea what income the IP is producing. It is probably not going through SPR. Not uncommon to have your IP in another non trading company and for IP income to not go through the books of the working company.   The way that information was released and the assertions made says to me someone is working real hard to try to discredit SPR.  What I do know is when you can eliminate wheels, vehicle motors, wings, all forms of aircraft motors and rockets, the IP would threaten a lot of sunk capital and jobs.  Shawyer has said that the developers of the next gen of EMDrives are not from the west and don't care of all the western aerospace companies go bankrupt."
EmDrive,3b3x0v,ItsAConspiracy,2,Thu Jul 2 06:40:18 2015 UTC,"The way that information was released and the assertions made says to me someone is working real hard to try to discredit SPR.   WHY!? There is no good reason to do this. Shawyer is obviously a crackpot, there is no reason to discredit him."
EmDrive,3b3x0v,Magnesus,2,Thu Jul 2 07:11:49 2015 UTC,"Works entirely within physics  faster and faster until wind resistance limits further acceleration   If you assert your setup would accelerate without bound (short of relativity) in a frictionless vacuum, it would be a demonstrable free-energy machine, which is not working within physics. Unlike linear KE, rotational KE is readily harvested as other forms of energy. The flywheel industry operates on the fact rotational energy is proportional to the square of rotational velocity. Will your guide address this point? (Yes, F = ma, but that doesn't solve the problem. Constant unopposed force on an object causes an exponential buildup of kinetic energy for the same reason as constant acceleration. It's plain to see in the fundamental units energy, force, and acceleration are comprised of.)"
EmDrive,3b3x0v,NicknameUnavailable,0,Thu Jul 2 03:22:20 2015 UTC,There is no free energy.  The measured Kinetic energy increase of the rotating 100kg mass was that which was measured being drawn from the electrical supply.  Acceleration followed A = F/M
EmDrive,3b3x0v,Fallcious,10,Thu Jul 2 03:27:57 2015 UTC,Shawyer is probably a bit lost in this and if he found something it's by sheer luck and his science is laughable   There is a very simple and relatively cheap test for this: make the cavity superconducting and see if it has an enormous increase in thrust.  According to Shawyer (the only one to actually produce something new in the realm of the EMDrive - the EMDrive itself) it will make a 1KW RF source nearly capable of lifting a car if you have a superconducting cavity.  The logical thing to do seems to be to simply try that test - all our mathematical proofs are derived from experiments with actual data - they can be used to predict some things but their very nature means they cannot predict anything that was not alluded to in previous experiments.  Take an approach to science more like a Sudoku puzzle - you have to constantly look at it from different angles to actually crack it.  If the test Shawyer has proposed pans out then great - new science.  If it doesn't pan out then great - we can start looking for the actual cause.  Either way it's more experimental data than we had.
EmDrive,3b3x0v,Yakukoo,9,Fri Jun 26 00:17:18 2015 UTC,McCulloch's theory also predicts much higher thrust with a superconducting cavity.
EmDrive,3b3x0v,Eric1600,7,Fri Jun 26 01:55:05 2015 UTC,People at NFS claim it is both not cheap and not simple. It will be extremely hard to keep the temperature down for the superconductor to work when you are bombarding the frustum with EM.
EmDrive,3b3x0v,LoreChano,6,Fri Jun 26 11:31:53 2015 UTC,People at NFS claim it is both not cheap and not simple. It will be extremely hard to keep the temperature down for the superconductor to work when you are bombarding the frustum with EM.   It doesn't need to be a production-ready device.  If it jumps off the table for a tenth of a second you know it works.
EmDrive,3b3x0v,Magnesus,3,Fri Jun 26 11:55:44 2015 UTC,"But that's the thing, people have measured (and shown) movement. That's why there is excitement among the advanced propulsion community. The problem is proving that the propulsion is from something other than thermal or magnetic effects. That's why all these clever people are developing theories as to why it might work and developing experiments that will hopefully rule out any artefacts and show something more conclusive. I am personally excited to see what seashell's copper mesh fustrum does."
EmDrive,3b3x0v,Eric1600,35,Sat Jun 27 12:21:44 2015 UTC,"Thank you! What you just said is exactly what I, and I'm sure many others, have been thinking lately.   I've been silently following this sub and other sources, hyped up about the EmDrive and its possible applications, all the while trying to contain my enthusiasm in a ball of rational skepticism. All this ""WOOO THIS IS AMAZING"" without any new data to support it is only making me lean more and more towards the idea that it's been a scam after all, as much as I'd hate that ...  I'm hyped as hell for the peer review results and the contents of the article, but until that's revealed, let's just stick to what we have and leave wild speculations aside ..."
EmDrive,3b3x0v,_hooo,24,Thu Jun 25 19:45:01 2015 UTC,"As someone who has spent a fair bit of time exchanging comments with him, I must admit I enjoy /u/TheTravellerEMD enthusiasm.  I personally feel he is too emotionally invested in the idea, but that happens to a lot of people.  I don't think he should be singled out just because he is very convinced and prolific in his comments.  In science there is often a level of debate which can be hard to follow.  It is important that people like /u/TheTravellerEMD be involved in the discussion rather than cut out.  It is better to try to turn their energy into a positive by either re-enforcing the quality of the results or disproving them.  If you cut them out all together from the discussion, then they are disenfranchised and often become more emotionally attached to a concept rather than open to changing their minds.  At this point there really is no clear proof of anything with the EM Drive.  There are many experiments which none really correlate with each other well.  We should be designing better well-designed and more expensive experiments, not flooding the Internet with repeats and sketchy attempts.  Honestly I don't think the credibility of this sub is in danger.  It's just a casual place for wacky ideas and people who are excited about science.  This is a good thing and I think people learning the importance of a well designed experiment, good data collection, and supporting theories is a good experience.  So while I don't think his spreadsheet for a waveguide should be stickied, I also don't think we should be posting about individuals or banning them.  Especially when they, for the most part, are discussing their ideas sincerely and without attacking people."

EmDrive,3b3x0v,TheTravellerEMD,10,Thu Jun 25 22:17:11 2015 UTC,TheTraveller is very active on NSF (probably from the very beginning) and was helpful in many cases.

EmDrive,3b3x0v,bitofaknowitall,7,Thu Jun 25 22:22:20 2015 UTC,No.  I don't know him outside of r/emdrive and NSF.  I don't think this user is playing tricks at all.  However he/she is not very objective about interpolating the test results and extrapolating to a theory.
EmDrive,3b3x0v,smckenzie23,8,Fri Jun 26 05:21:45 2015 UTC,"Normally I would agree with you for the most part.  But this single person has dominated all discussion in this sub with his posts and comments whilst adamantly claiming he knows exactly how this drive works and we have to take his word on it because he has access to critical information that nobody else has access to.  It is not his optimism or his enthusiasm I object to but the weight given to his assertions by his correspondence with Shawyer.  I make no claims that he should be banned from participation, only that he should not be treated as an authority or allowed to spam the sub with outdated information.  This sub should be a neutral and science-minded sub that collects and dissects all available information. Not a ""fun place for speculation"" that is why the previous stickied post was a handwavium repository. So that discusions could be limited to facts and theories as much as possible.  This sub up until now has been phenomenal at doing so, even the limited moderation. I would prefer it remain a neutral and evidence based discussion sub but so long as we accept /u/TheTravellerEMD 's assertions on faith it will not be."
EmDrive,3b3x0v,TheTravellerEMD,5,Thu Jun 25 22:23:25 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Almost all his posts reference ""secret data"" ... I don't see how that contributes to the discussion."
EmDrive,3b3x0v,Risley,3,Thu Jun 25 22:31:12 2015 UTC,"Personally I don't think this sub will ever be a serious place for science.  However I've been lurking here to help explain things or explore other's ideas.  I feel there is almost zero evidence of something new in physics going on, at least right now, so a sub based on evidence would be pretty dull.  There will always be people who can't tell evangelicals from experts.  And yes they can scare off experts who don't want to spend days trying to explain away knotted ball of pseudo-theory.  I don't know how to avoid that.  I guess those posts about secret info and upcoming peer review and knowing for sure how things work, don't really bother me much because I see it as just BS."

EmDrive,3b3x0v,TheTravellerEMD,23,Thu Jun 25 19:53:38 2015 UTC,"Criticism of one man's actions that can damage the credibility of this sub, isn't a personal attack.

This post is about a guy who claims ""I've just read the paper and all doubts have been erased!!!"" and come to find out this paper is just more speculation of what a non-existent em drive could do. That kind of misrepresention is worthy of discussing on a subreddit where a relatively small amount of content exists in the first place and a good deal of it comes from this questionable source. Again you don't get to just cry ad hominem and call it a day, you can have a discussion about someone's actions in relation to a group forum and this doesn't by definition make your position invalid."

However I realized it was not just /u/TheTravellerEMD who is the problem but also everyone who has swallowed his assertions wholesale despite the fact that he has so far as I can tell provided nothing new and nothing concrete.

Shouldn't companies be lining up to make deals with SPR so as to be able to cash in on the clear profits that this technology represents?  Shouldn't Ford and Mercedes and Chrysler be leading the way? Why aren't they 10 years into development since this was deemed to work in 2002 by the UK?
EmDrive,3b3x0v,wallofwolfstreet,0,Thu Jul 2 06:31:50 2015 UTC,"Ford and Mercedes and Chrysler fought EVs for years.  It was only Tesla that forced them to get their heads out of the sand and make changes.  As to the Aerospace companies, they have billions in sunk capital. You expect them to walk away from that?  Shawyer has warned the West will lose out as the companies developing the next gen EMDrive vehicles are not from the 1st world and have nothing to lose in releasing EMDrive sat launch systems that only use 4t of cryo Lox and H2 to put 2t in LEO, which by the way is what SpaceX does with it's cargo runs to the ISS, expect they charge over $100m (F9 + Dragon) per cargo run."
EmDrive,3b3x0v,See-Shell,1 point,Thu Jul 2 06:46:52 2015 UTC,"Before Tesla Electric vehicles were impractical. They didn't fight them they just didn't see any profit in them.    The U.S. and Canada Big Three automakers had their own electric car programs during the late-1960s. In 1967, much smaller AMC partnered with Gulton Industries to develop a new battery based on lithium and a speed controller designed by Victor Wouk.[34] A nickel-cadmium battery supplied power to an all-electric 1969 Rambler American station wagon.[34] Other ""plug-in"" experimental AMC vehicles developed with Gulton included the Amitron (1967) and the similar Electron (1977). More battery-electric concept cars appeared over the years, such as the Scottish Aviation Scamp (1965),[35] the Enfield 8000 (1966)[36] and two electric versions of General Motors gasoline cars, the Electrovair (1966) and Electrovette (1976).[37] None of them entered production.   See when you make obviously absurd statements like:   Ford and Mercedes and Chrysler fought EVs for years.   You lose credibility.   For instance are you aware that Mercedes is one of the leading companies in developing Autonomous cars?  These companies are always trying to be ahead of the curve, not fighting advancement.   The Technology was not available for electric cars until the 21st century and as soon as it was every car company got involved. Tesla is just the most famous for explicitly working in Electric cars and having led the way in development.   As to the Aerospace companies, they have billions in sunk capital. You expect them to walk away from that?   Yes. Most Aerospace companies are more concerned with how to make profit in space then in using developed technology and infrastructure. For instance the near unlimited wealth in mining asteroids is reason enough to dump as much money as you can into any means of advanced propulsion.   If they felt that there was any legitimacy to the emdrive I see no reason why they would ignore this tech on some absurd ideas about sunk cost. Especially considering that the sunk cost fallacy is one of the first things you learn about in any business class."
EmDrive,3b3x0v,Boasen,0,Thu Jul 2 07:10:21 2015 UTC,"Having worked in very big corps, I can tell you they will bury tech to protect next quarters results.  New tech is cash flow costly and risky, not what shareholders what.  And BTW Mercedes did not make the move to EVs without being forced to do so by Tesla as NOW their investors demand more EVs as they can see the futures.  Big corps are future tech adverse, like ULA still launching 25 year old rockets, using 25 year old Russian engines."

I know that I plan to be completely transparent with my testing/results/methods and am open to suggestions on how to improve.  I am taking the opportunity of building as a way for others to make suggestions on testing procedures and essentially be part of the experiment.   I might take the idea that rfmwguy had and stream my tests as well once I can.   So, in essence, let's all just step away from the drama, let it calm down, and continue to investigate the machine itself and not the people building it."

If the people you have highlighted - TheTraveller and Shawyer - are running some kind of scheme to get money from people it seems long winded and spectacularly unsuccessful. Have you been asked for money to support them? The only money being spent in these experiments is on the actual experiments by the people investigating them - not to enthusiasts who are evangelising or selling the technology. People far more versed in Physics than myself are intrigued enough to look into it, and thats good enough for me to keep my interest."
EmDrive,3b560m,Fallcious,1 point,Fri Jun 26 05:06:27 2015 UTC,"noun Scam: informal noun: scam; plural noun: scams  1. a dishonest scheme; a fraud.   No where in the definition presupposes an intent to defraud money, just defraud. But I would say often scams that do not start out with the intent of defrauding money often turn out to do so just by the nature of the beast.  Let's say you have a total EM believer who wants to build the full superconducting EM device with a massive power rating that would dispel all doubt. He sells the idea of building it, somehow gets funding then starts building it. About half way through(in our hypothetical situation), it because super obvious that the EM drive doesn't work, but he still has 50% of the money left. He then has a choice: admit failure and refund the remaining money to the original backers, or pocket the money and stall for a few months before finally stating that more funding is required to build the device ""correctly, using new found and hard won knowledge on the first build"". Said person might state they need a lot more money hoping people will just give up and said person could walk away with the money. Of course, the story gets real sad when or if somebody says, ""oh hey you need lots more money, sure no problem!""  And that's how fraud and scams can be born. Not saying this is the, just that it happens."
EmDrive,3b560m,Deeviant,-2,Fri Jun 26 20:11:03 2015 UTC,"Ok, so you have defined scam to mean something other than a dishonest scheme for money, then explained how this may be a dishonest scheme to gain money. That's fine. However the conversations that TheTraveller has had with people on reddit and the NASA forum do not seem to be directed at separating people from their money. In fact there is no suggestion that they financially back anything. The people who need to be convinced control corporate and governmental grants and they will only open those purse strings at this point for something backed with hard evidence, not enthusiasm.  However I am done with supporting TheTraveller after the most recent fiasco. I still don't think it's all a 'scam' but something is definitely off about that whole matter, if only that Shawyers supporters gave too much credence to his shaky grasp of physics. I am now only interested in what the independent theorists and engineers discover."
EmDrive,3b560m,Fallcious,5,Fri Jun 26 23:36:27 2015 UTC,"I did not at all suggest that this could be a scam for money, I simply gave an example of how honest efforts could turn to one. It is a very simple thing to prove the em drive out, at higher power ratings, a high school science team could verify it's usefulness, the fact that hasn't happen now should be very worrying for EM drive hopefuls.  I am very interested in the EM drive, but I am not at all interested in hype. Also, I have more than enough knowledge of physics to be extremely skeptic of the EM drive."
EmDrive,3b560m,Deeviant,8,Sat Jun 27 02:33:37 2015 UTC,"Don't let /u/TheTravellerEMD's overenthousiasm cloud the facts.   The facts are that multiple tests by multiple people have established that EMDrives seem to generate a certain amount of thrust. Thrust that is orders of magnitude over the Photon Rocket thrust. People are still trying to figure out if this is an artifact of the various tests, or if it is in fact generating thrust through yet unexplained ways.  As long as there is no explanation for the thrust observed during the tests, we have no answer to what exactly is going on here."
EmDrive,3b560m,YugoReventlov,2,Fri Jun 26 09:43:46 2015 UTC,"This seems like the most important line here to me. Sure, scam or misinformation or politics or poor science might be going on.   Facts are until the thrust is explained or is unable to be accounted for by conventional means there is work to be done. And good on the university students, independents, hackers, and professionals taking on the task while facing criticism and skepticism - for the rewards of new knowledge usually are not easily perceived by those creating it. This is not the case if the emdrive proves fruitful.   What will happen in the meantime is going to be hype, hope, misinformation, marketing, fundraising, branding and all the other ways anyone can think of to move their ideas forward, right?"

EmDrive,3b560m,TheTravellerEMD,5,Thu Jul 2 00:14:03 2015 UTC,"Scam implies there's some coordinated effort by all these people to defraud.  No one but Shawyer has profit as a motive so I'm not inclined to say scam.  The rest would just be crackpots.  I'm rather depressed by the hackaday team's lack of scientific rigor, by TheTraveller's false claims, and by Shawyer's lack of any useful data.  But I remain a tiny bit hopeful that we'll see some more positive, scientifically rigorous results from Eagleworks and a few of the upcoming DIY testers."
EmDrive,3b560m,bitofaknowitall,8,Fri Jun 26 12:26:20 2015 UTC,"I think hackaday simply tried to be very open (and ""modern"") by just posting things as and when they happened, in real time, so we saw it, warts and all.  Often a battery or something would fail.  There was not even time for proper null runs even had they been planned, and we saw them change methods on the fly.  I think their silence recently is probably just a gathering of breath while they get their act together and do their work without so many Internet-empowered armchair generals (like me) niggling (correctly mind) at their elbow.  I'm hoping their future output will come when it comes, (it takes time) and that they will have responded to all the main criticisms in their experiment designs.  (To get ""high sigma"" results from such a small effect, really it might take months and months of runs, I'm guessing.)  I wish them all the best."

EmDrive,3b560m,greenepc,7,Sat Jun 27 16:53:13 2015 UTC,"You should get your facts straight if you want to accuse people of scam. Hackaday had not disassembled any emdrive - they just had to find another way to test their baby emdrive because the test rig was unstable: ""The levitation device is overwhelmed with the weight. It's just a toy that normally supports a spinning globe, and we put about 20g more into it than originally."" (from the AMA they did here). They are not working on a new device, they are working on a better way to test it right now. And they seem to have taken to heart the comments about their later test (which were useless) and are taking their time now, probably working on a new levitation rig judging by their latest comment.  Shawyer on the other hand is out of money (judging by his company public data that someone on NSF found), so he can't really do anything right now. Making a superconducting cavity is very expensive and hard."

There is no established theory of operation for the drive. So where do you go from there? Its not like you know crap about scaling it up. These are just people experimenting in their garage using their spare time and money. Not professionals making a product or starting a company, at least not yet.  It just simply works, and they can add their work to the growing body of evidence this thing may be for real."

EmDrive,3b560m,Deeviant,-1,Fri Jun 26 20:16:02 2015 UTC,"It's not bitterness.  People are doing the research - this isn't something undertaken by some megacorp or alphabet agency - it's a bunch of individuals spending their personal money to test something because they want to see if it works or not and to share that knowledge with others.  ""Nay-sayers"" are others that tend to come into where these people congregate, detract from the work they are doing and ultimately lower morale.  If they had their run of the place they would be self-fulfilled prophets because the people actually doing the research would become so disheartened they would simply give up.  These ""nay-sayers"" have turned the ideas of skepticism and anti-scientific attitudes into a religion and they are on an ideological crusade to destroy researchers for their own amusement and out of their own bitterness in life.

EmDrive,3b560m,Deeviant,0,Sat Jun 27 19:12:47 2015 UTC,"Honestly the forces that most home built kit could generate are so small they are basically going to be measuring noise.  There is also no way to fine tune the cavity without a proper network analyzer and other expensive RF gear.  You're seeing people ""move on"" because there's not much else they can do.  They try to make something, it's noisy, maybe it shows something or maybe it's just an artifact.  Either way it's beyond most amateurs ability to isolate anyway.  To get more measurable results you need a high power generator and proper equipment for measuring S-parameters of the setup and power delivered.  You also need to have very accurate waveguides with extremely well made contacts to avoid discontinuities of any type.  To get to the next level from there you'll need superconducting wave guides which are hard to build, expensive and require even more specialized equipment."

It spends some time arriving at a value of kinetic energy of 1/2MV2, which is correct, only that it was completely unnecesary because you can find it on any introductory physics texbook. Then applies it to calculate the final kinetic energy of a interstellar probe reaching close to 70% c.   Only you can't use that formula because now relativistic effects are important.  Let's give him the benefit of the doubt however and properly calculate the final kinetic energy of the probe using classical mechanics and his own formula. At 8936 kg for the probe, it's going to be:  1/2 * 8936 * 2044290002 = 1.867E20 Joules, or 5,16E13 kWh. No surprises here, it's the same it appears on the paper and is a quite large amount. It's 2,4 times the amount of electricity produced in the whole world in 2012. If the probe doesn't decelerate and hits the target planet, it'll do it releasing energy equivalent to 2000 times the B41 nuclear bomb, the most powerful weapon ever designed by the USA.   The nuclear reactor should be able to provide for that, maybe in the 9.8 years it's been accelerating? Well, he mentions that it can produce 0,2 kW of electricity, which unless I blundered with the numbers, and assuming perfect engine efficiency, it means the poor nuclear engine it's going to need 7,17E10 years to provide all that energy which is more or less five times the current age of the universe; I think that mission is going to take a bit longer than anticipated. For a machine that is not claimed to generate free energy, it's sure getting a lot of juice from somewhere.  But his calculations don't show energy being created. In fact, it shows a very reasonable efficiency of 0,31. The problem is, he's calculating input power from his own thrust instead of just power generated by the reactor as any sane procedure would."

The dubious theoretical and mathematical basis of Shawyer's explanations for the Emdrive have been commented and known since some time ago. Way before this was a popular topic and this very sub existed.  Neither it was clear that the Emdrive could really scale in force as he presumed, by building a superconducting cavity. It was just an hypothesis without a known confirmation or refutation. That's why so many of us expected this paper to go into that direction, providing results validating what Shawyer said.  Nevertheless most people discussing this seriously assume Sawyer's explanation is simply wrong, and that him expecting the thrust to grow tremendously because of the use of a superconductive cavity was unwarranted.   That doesn't remove the merit of Shawyer having potentially discovered a new phenomenon, but it can perfectly happen that he doesn't really understand what he found and that it doesn't really behave as he expects.  Thus the bigger the value of the other experiments, because they can help determine the validity of this and to characterize its behavior, without having the bias of Shawyer's expectations."

So are you saying it only works in a gravity well like Earth's?  Well, the solar system is in the gravity well of the sun, which means it would at least work within the solar system to some lesser extent.

You can measure some data, but if you can't figure out how to explain it, then you have to keep looking for reasons why you can't explain it:  noise, interference, poor setup, poor calibration, unknown factors.   This leads to trying to find another test setup to reduce anything in the data that doesn't fit theoretical expectations.  Only when all unknown sources of error are found and eliminated and it still doesn't fit theory, then you need to re-evaluate the calculations, the theory, the setup and the experiment.  When you've done all that and the results still don't match, you'll need someone else to look at it because odds are good you missed something along the way.

Not everything can be calculated because calculations are derived from experiment and there is no known experiment that covers everything as experiments are necessarily designed to pinpoint specific things.  Theory can go a long way but if experimental data goes against it you have to start on new theories.  For thousands of years thinking of the universe as air/earth/wind/fire did fucking wonders for science and gave us a great deal of technology.  Eventually that theory had to be tossed aside because experimental data went against it.  Now we have another experiment going against theory, the solution is unlikely to be hacking at the theory (we tried that with quantum mechanics and we still can't make it mesh with relativity.)"

EmDrive,3az4qq,TheTravellerEMD,3,Thu Jun 25 04:09:42 2015 UTC,"A laser gyro experiences ""lock in"" when the nodes align and this is due to the circular propagation of the EM wave back upon itself when it is not moving.  This is not the case in the em drive's wave guide.  In addition the mechanics of what is happening in a ring laser gyroscope is completely different that Shawyer's theory of how momentum exchange is taking place.  In the gyroscope the doppler shift of the EM wave are measured directly to indicate movement.  However in the EM drive the theory is the doppler shift itself is producing force.  These are very different concepts."
EmDrive,3az4qq,Eric1600,-2,Thu Jun 25 05:41:53 2015 UTC,What is not different is external movement causes internal Doppler shifts.
EmDrive,3az4qq,TheTravellerEMD,1 point,Thu Jun 25 06:19:50 2015 UTC,"Because the laser gyro isn't generating movement, it is measuring external movement."

None of the datasets are consistent enough with each other, much less other test labs to show proof of anything specific.

EmDrive,3az4qq,Eric1600,4,Thu Jun 25 01:22:46 2015 UTC,"Both the SPR and Chinese data is consistent. Eagleworks ignored Shawyer's advise and got very inconsistant results bring 30uN or the Force generated by the weight of a SnowFlake falling on their equipment.  For the record here are the reported results  Chinese 720,000uN SPR 175,000uN Eagleworks 000,030uN  Just maybe Eagleworks should have listen to Shawyer, which the Chinese did."
EmDrive,3az4qq,TheTravellerEMD,6,Thu Jun 25 04:14:31 2015 UTC,Come on their results were not consistent either from what I see.  Can you prove this to me?
EmDrive,3az4qq,Eric1600,-1,Thu Jun 25 05:23:55 2015 UTC,"Have you read the 4 Chinese and 8 SPR papers? Their results are highly consistent. As Q increases, the generated Force increases, as input power increases, factoring in cavity bandwidth to Rf gen frequency match, the generated Force increases.  I have been told that dealing with high Q cavities and wide band Rf sources that can't be frequency matched to dynamically changing cavity conditions can be very frustrating to say rhe least.  In closing, these cavities can be highly unstable unless you can automatically adjust frequency to stay in the middle of the dynamically changing conditions inside the cavity."
EmDrive,3az4qq,TheTravellerEMD,4,Thu Jun 25 05:57:07 2015 UTC,"They might be consistent with themselves, but not with each facility.  I've built many waveguides and you don't have dynamically changing conditions inside them."
EmDrive,3az4qq,Eric1600,1 point,Thu Jun 25 16:41:52 2015 UTC,I think he's talking about heat warping the frustrum.
EmDrive,3az4qq,TheNarrMaster,0,Fri Jun 26 01:02:44 2015 UTC,"Then you understand the group velocity alters as the cavity diameter alters the guide wavelength, which is altered by the cutoff wavelength.  The group velocity at the small diameter end is slower than the group velocity at the big diameter end.  Inside the cavity are resonant standing microwaves. When you move the cavity, Doppler shift develops at each end, altering the effective end plate group velocity and thus momentum xfer to the end plate. Very small effect but each bounce amplifies it higher and higher.  Try reading this to further understand: http://www.emdrive.com/IAC13paper17254.v2.pdf section 2"
EmDrive,3az4qq,TheTravellerEMD,2,Thu Jul 2 03:07:55 2015 UTC,"Are you talking about group velocity or phase velocity?  It appears this paper is talking about phase velocity.  If this is the case I wouldn't need a tapered waveguide, I could just phase shift my source to create this effect artificially.  This is done all the time in fading simulators and an in many DSP equalizers, even cell phones have the ability to simulate Doppler phase shifts in their signal processing.  This is especially true for the Iridium satellite phones.  They transmit a Doppler shifted signal so that when the doppler shift occurs it restores the signal.  And how does it amplify itself?"
EmDrive,3az4qq,Eric1600,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:45:55 2015 UTC,"Shawyer only talks about group velocity, which is always below 1c and is determined by the excitation mode, excitation frequency and cavity diameter.

EmDrive,3az4qq,TheTravellerEMD,-2,Fri Jul 3 00:44:15 2015 UTC,Again totally incorrect. I just explained how the EMDrive generates Force.
EmDrive,3az4qq,TheTravellerEMD,6,Thu Jun 25 04:07:29 2015 UTC,Yes it should be a red flag.  Also physical shock to metals when they are exposed to EM fields can induce stronger magnetic alignments and this might be what is generating external Lorenz forces causing the em drive to move rather than anything special going on inside.
EmDrive,3az4qq,Eric1600,-4,Thu Jun 25 01:19:40 2015 UTC,"Totally incorrect.  In a non moving frustum momentum is balanced being EM wave delivered momentum is highest at the big end. As a result the cavity moves to the small end. End result is no movement as both momentum movements are the same amount but in different direction.  As for getting the frustum from Idle mode to Motor mode, external movement big end toward small end causes Doppler shifts in the internal resonant standing waves which upset the momentum balance and cause the frustum to move big end to small end.  Very simple actually."
EmDrive,3az4qq,TheTravellerEMD,10,Thu Jun 25 04:05:41 2015 UTC,"Totally incorrect.   Excuse me?  This is a well known phenomenon.  The doppler shifting of two inertial frames of reference producing a momentum exchange is far more unlikely and unproven.

Especially when you end by trying to insult me with a ""very simple"" comment."
EmDrive,3az4qq,Eric1600,-1,Thu Jun 25 05:30:54 2015 UTC,"2 points  1) The EMDrive produces propellantless thrust as per SPR, Chinese & Eagleworks replications.  2) SPR have a theory of how it works which matches the 3 observed and measured modes of operation being IDLE, MOTOR & GENERATOR MODE.  If you refuse to accept that information, then we will agree to disagree."
EmDrive,3az4qq,TheTravellerEMD,7,Thu Jun 25 05:48:42 2015 UTC,"No.  I'm talking about the data.  They have dramatic differences in their results in terms of Q used, Force Produced vs input power."
EmDrive,3az4qq,Eric1600,1 point,Thu Jun 25 05:57:57 2015 UTC,"Their is another factor in the Generated Force equation. It us called Design Factor and involves the big & small end diameters, excition mode, small end cutoff wavelength abd effective guide wavelength.  So more than Q and power us involved.  Also need to factor in where the frequency sits in relation to what I call the Force bandwidth.  What the SPR and Chinese data do show is there is higher Force generation as Q increases but that is a very general statement.  I plan to do a VERY controlled series of tests to generate high quality data and get rid of the fuzzy data from unmatched frequency to cavity bandwidth. All will be streamed live, with live data. As far as I know, my measurement of cavity Force generation bandwidth will be the 1st such public data."
EmDrive,3az4qq,TheTravellerEMD,7,Thu Jun 25 06:18:12 2015 UTC,"There have been a couple of posts indicating that you need an ""exciter"" vibration to kickstart the effect. The more you try to remove stray vibrations and other forms of noise to improve your measurements, the more you see failed starts."
EmDrive,3az4qq,btribble,2,Thu Jun 25 02:30:45 2015 UTC,"Why did you only post the 2nd part? I assume as it would invalidate your biased post.  For the record here is all od what was said.   A  number of  methods  have  been  used  in  the  UK,  the  US  and  China  to  measure  the forces  produced  by  an  EmDrive  thruster. In  each  successful  case,  the  EmDrive  force data  has  been  superimposed  on  an  increasing  or decreasing  background  force, generated by the test equipment itself. Indeed,  in  the  UK  when  the  background  force  changes were  eliminated,  in  an  effort to  improve  force  measurement  resolution,  no  EmDrive  force  was  measured.  This was clearly  a  result of  attempting  to  measure  the  forces  on  a  fully  static thruster, where T and R cancel each other.  UK  flight  thruster measurements  employ  this  principle  to  calibrate  the  background noise on the force balance prior to carrying out force measurements."

Differential Doppler shift of the standing wave inside the cavity will detect movement / acceleration / deceleration.

EmDrive,3az4qq,LoreChano,2,Thu Jun 25 14:02:10 2015 UTC,"To be very clear a truly non moving frustum has resonant standing waves. Those waves contain momentum. When the EMDrive is not moving, there is no external momentum as the momentum in the waves is moving to the big end and the cavity moves to the small end. As these momentum are the same but moving in different direction, the EMDrive doesn't move.  However if even a very small external force is applied, Doppler shifts occur in the once resonant standing waves and the momentum balance is upset, resulting in the generation of an external Force that either opposes the external Force (Generator Mode) or supports it (Motor Mode)."

EmDrive,3aycc5,Eric1600,2,Wed Jun 24 15:08:20 2015 UTC,There are definitely a lot of people expounding theories as passionately true rather than critically.  Including that the em drive even works as advertised....

Of course anything about this must remain strictly in scientific terms: anything about it must be validated by evidence and replication.  That's why I don't like very much to think about the potential things we could possibly have, and I rather prefer to think about what the latest experimental results are.  The what-if and the imagined potential applications have been done to death in the past, up to the point of making these dreams into mere clichés and no longer accepted as valid futurology speculation,  being seen as mere science fiction.   That is, something similar to the daydreams people have, about the wonderful things they would do if they just found a magic lamp.

It would seem to me that if this is a legitimate technology we'd already have effective confirmation.  Boeing has known about it for years?  Not to mention the various think-tank groups scattered across the globe.  I know that Bose has a very well funded R&D department for all manner of technologies - they poured a lot of time and money into cold fusion replication, for example - and that's not to mention Google and Microsoft's extremely well funded and staffed departments, etc.  Seeing as how the technology is simple enough for random folks to begin their own builds, I'm having an extremely difficult time squaring this with the idea that none of these other aggressive, ambitious, and ludicrously well-funded groups wouldn't have already been able to slam dunk it.  As much as I want this all to be true, well..."
EmDrive,3aycc5,tchernik,6,Wed Jun 24 17:04:59 2015 UTC,"I share that sentiment. Something so good and presumably easy to replicate, ought to have caught up by now, right?  Well, maybe not. First, this represents a very strong departure from accepted theories and paradigms (I hate that word, but it applies). Something that may even redefine physics isn't something that would be warmly received, regardless of what the philosophy of science discourse says, that science is about questioning assumptions.  Au contraire, assumptions become ways of living, and the knowledge emanating from them earns livings and makes careers. Something so drastically disruptive would be fought tooth and nail.  And the most effective way to do that, is just ignore it, suppress it from polite discussion. Not doing replications kills the credibility of the single lonesome positive report.  And this doesn't need any conspiracy to happen. Our own reluctance to test an assertion we find too outlandish can, and it already has delayed science by years and decades before.  It took a while for someone else to do the first independent replication that we know of (the Chinese NWPU tests), and another while for the second one (NASA EagleWorks's), and just now we have people doing their own.  It seems to me we are rather at the start of a tidal wave, where replications will pour and the truth will come out. Regardless if it's comfortable or not to those usually tasked with finding out these scientific truths.  They will probably come back to it, simply by having no other option."
EmDrive,3aycc5,Taven,6,Wed Jun 24 17:21:12 2015 UTC,"The flip-side to this is that none of those companies have come out and said it doesn't work.

But nobody has said anything, it's been absolutely quiet, and here NASA is testing it with no objections from any industry.   It may be that nobody has taken it seriously, because it's a closed system producing thrust, which is right up there with perpetual motion devices in terms of fringe science."
EmDrive,3aycc5,wallofwolfstreet,5,Wed Jun 24 17:24:11 2015 UTC,"What does a company gain by coming out and saying it doesn't work?  Absolutely nothing.

If they say it doesn't work, and they are wrong, then they look like idiots who wasted a billion dollar opportunity.  If they say it doesn't work, and it truly doesn't, people will still be pissy with them for ruining the dream.

EmDrive,3aycc5,Honest_Stu,5,Wed Jun 24 18:16:34 2015 UTC,"Similarly, I would imagine there is a fair bit to gain by not declaring success, so while competitors are still testing and experimenting, the company that knows can begin developing the infrastructure to begin production and establish private contracts."

If there were no presumed results involved, this won't receive a second look.  The only potential harm is wasted time (and money for those making experiments, and it is not that much) and disappointment.  Disappointments we know. We have had a fair share of them in the past.

EmDrive,3b0jrd,ProxyCola,1 point,Fri Jun 26 18:32:26 2015 UTC,"If I understand it isn't changing the horizon of information (like a Rindler horizon with movement) or anything. It is just that the nodes of waves fit between the horizon and the cavity, and more fit in the large end that the small. Since you discard waves that don't fit, the waves are damped on one side. And since inertia is related to these Unruh waves, there is slightly higher inertial mass on one side of the frustum. This creates something like a Woodward effect, where when photons resonate back and forth, they change inertial mass across the gradient and thus transform momentum.   What does change the horizon of information is movement, which creates a Rindler horizon behind you. In MiHsC view, that damps the Unruh radiation behind you and puts more pressure in front of you, resisting acceleration with a Hubble scale Casimir effect that causes inertia. In this case the change in the Rindler horizon creates inertia.  From his [blog]():   If we assume that the cavity walls are like the cosmic horizon in MiHsC then they will damp some Unruh radiation and make inertia weaker, but less so at the wider end. So the photons at the wide end have more inertia, and photons gain mass going from the narrow to the wide end.   So if I understand (which is unlikely):  1) all objects create a horizon with the Hubble/Rindler Horizon.   2) The small gradient in inertial mass for things of this shape is always there.   3) When we get photons to resonate back and forth across this gradient we get something like a Woodward effect, which transfers momentum as the mass changes  It is at least plausible.  http://arxiv.org/pdf/1302.2775v1.pdf"

If you had this tech and the patents and it worked and you had scaled it, why would you release a paper extrapolating possibilities over putting out a genuine test article to show that you have scaled the effect from your initial video (in 2006, 9 years ago) and give people the specs so they can peer review and replicate| do they expect someone to ""replicate"" their extrapolations on a device they fully admit they do not fully understand the mechanism for?

A bit of clarification:  The Eagleworks crew hope to have the 1.2kW magnetron teeter-totter test-rig up and running by the END of June or perhaps now the first couple of weeks of July 2015.  At the moment we are in the middle component procurement & fabrication, and that task is taking longer than expected due to mill breakdowns in the NASA fabrication shop and the usual supply vendor's taking their time to fill and ship orders.    The part about getting to 100uN being important was in one of his prior posts. That's the threshold where NASA would test it at one of their bigger labs (IIRC, the threshold was due to this being the minimum force the other lab could detect)."

This field has plenty of theoretical models put forward by various people but lacks serious experimental data.   I'll believe in his theoritical launch device when he can prove thrust can scale with Q and by superconducting the frustrum.  A hovering device should do it.

Shortly after the huge break in the news back in April Air-Force announce an X37B launch for May 20th 2015, this launch will use NASA's Kennedy space center.   (if you wanted to place a NASA derived tech ontop of a Rocket body, this is where you would want to do it)  3.) Air-force launches can classify the mission, payload and nearly everything else about the launch.  4.) The launch itself had something very weird to test in space: http://www.space.com/29448-x37b-space-plane-launches-fourth-mission.html - it was going to test an ""Advance hull thrust engine"" .... Why would you need to test an engine in space, unless it was something that was currently confounding your scientists?  all thruster tests I've seen from SpaceX and NASA have been performed in atmosphere, and then sent to space. -The X37B mission details instantly get classified the instant before it makes its orbital burn.  If you had a technology that you needed to test in space, but didn't want it to destabilize the economic markets if it was a wild success, then you would need a launch platform that would have the same abilities the shuttle did, but the mission was classified...   **edit: also, you wouldn't use a propellant inside the payload bay of the X37B, the space-craft isn't all that large so bringing fuel and storage up just for a test would be very large and expelling propellant that close to craft could have potential for damage to the craft.  You wouldn't in my estimating, foil hat wearing theorizing, put a propellant spuing thruster anywhere near the middle of an open payload bay full of sensitive material and a 1.2billion dollar craft.  but i would test other ""advanced propellant less"" thrusters. **  ok foil hat removed... Some very intriguing technology, and i really do hope for it to be true, but there is no real demonstration of it doing anything other than spinning a table around in circles maybe twice but can't explain if its the EM-Drive or just an unbalanced table that made it spin..."

EmDrive,3b2gxc,god_uses_a_mac,-1,Thu Jul 2 01:07:49 2015 UTC,"There is NO NEW PHYSICS.  Waves travelling in a waveguide don't travel at light speed as they normally do. They travel at the waveguides diameter dependent GROUP VELOCITY and the Momentum they impart when bouncing off one of the end plates is proportional to the group velocity.  This is nothing new. Has been known for years. What is new is the group velocity and momentum xfer is different at each end of the cavity due to different diameters.  However in a non accelerating cavity, the momentum xfer to the end plates is balanced by the opposite momentum xfer to the cavity, so no motion.  When the resonant microwave energy filled cavities standing waves experience Doppler shift as the cavity accelerates, the momentum xfer to the end plates alter as the Doppler shift alters the group velocity at each end.  It is actually very simple to understand and see that no new physics is needed. Just a neat effect that allows resonant standing wave microwave energy to be converted into Force, then Acceleration and finally into Kinetic energy, which by the way comes from the electrical power supply.  The evidence has been there since 2002 when Shawyer 1st approached the UK gov. They put together an expert group of 7 British Aerospace companies and individuals to check Shawyers 1st Experimental EMDrive results.

It's been nearly a decade.  I'd be more worried if they didn't have an improved version by now.  For all we know, the X37B has been flying around the planet using an emDrive for the past two years. (my own little conspiracy theory) The real question is whether they actually understand WHY the new generation performs better."
EmDrive,3b2gxc,Magnesus,2,Thu Jun 25 17:25:21 2015 UTC,"No! It didn't clearly work in 2006!  Is it intriguing, sure!  You saw a video of a device moving. Yes, it clearly moved. Was it clearly a reactionless drive, no!  You can be extremely excited about the potentialities of something working and still remain skeptical and level-headed. It takes discipline though."

EmDrive,3azaxr,Rowenstin,4,Wed Jun 24 18:45:22 2015 UTC,"This brings me to an interesting point: A control experiment was performed where the washing machine was operated empty, that is without any laundry inside. It was expected for the washing machine to remain stationary. However, a lateral movement of the machine of about 3.7 cm was observed in the same direction. It is thus believed in some circles that the force is a result of the inherent imbalance of the washing machine drum, so the relativistic acceleration could actually be occurring within the rotating metal drum itself. In this scenario, the dirty laundry would merely act as a catalyst for the process, adding to the rotating asymmetric mass and thereby increasing the centripetal force. Also, in another experiment the washing machine was rotated 180° before it was switched on. Interestingly, a movement in the other direction (to the right) was observed of about the same magnitude. So it can be ruled out that metal parts of the machine interact with the magnetic field of the earth. A video of both experiments was made and will be published in ten years."

Just saying, in the past, way less was enough:   Eddington compared his eclipse photos with images taken when the sun was not present, and announced that the sun had caused a deflection of roughly 1.61 seconds of arc, a result that was in agreement with Einstein’s prediction, thereby validating the theory of general relativity. http://simonsingh.net/media/articles/maths-and-science/1919-eclipse-and-general-relativity/"

At DARPA’s request, Eagleworks Lab began discussions with Cannae LLC on hosting a test article   Also:   SPR Ltd. Has produced several Microwave test articles.

EmDrive,3axn77,god_uses_a_mac,0,Thu Jun 25 11:55:24 2015 UTC,Eagleworks believe all the devices are Q Thrusters and use Quantum Vacuum particles as a Momentum dump. So they discount any theory not their own and push their QV theory.

Page 40 is where NASA posted Boeing/DARPA's results. Boeing is also using their X37B space vehicle to test propulsion devices.  Some silly space sail, that might actually be legit, and a ""Hal thruster"".  Hal thrusters have been tested and used in orbit, according to the wiki page, for almost 30 years.

EmDrive,3av604,bitofaknowitall,5,Tue Jun 23 19:56:11 2015 UTC,What was the justification for needing traditional propulsion on EMDrive-enabled craft again? (The rocket engines on that diagram...)
EmDrive,3av604,error_logic,4,Tue Jun 23 21:24:10 2015 UTC,"Initially, (or maybe still, I've lost track) it was believed that the EMdrive could negate gravity, but not really accelerate a vehicle. So the EMdrives would get the vehicle ""hovering"" while the rocket/jet/whatever engines would supply the needed propulsion to reach orbital speeds.   Now, if that has changed, and the EMdrive can be used as both a lift engine, and a main propulsion engine, than you will no longer need the ""booster"" engines on the side to create speed."
EmDrive,3av604,hms11,7,Tue Jun 23 21:29:12 2015 UTC,Everything you just said is pretty conflicting.
EmDrive,3av604,bbasara007,3,Wed Jun 24 01:05:01 2015 UTC,"I fully agree, that is just what has been stated for the potential functioning of this drive. I didn't write it, I'm just repeating it.  There seem to be a couple different schools of thought on this thing.  One of them says that the drive has a maximum speed that is not very fast, but will still be useful as a ""lift"" engine, to negate gravity. I don't fully understand why this is, but it has something to do with the drive having a state of reference or something (I am definitely not a scientist)  The other says that the drive will basically accelerate forever.  This is why my response was so contradictory, because everything we hear about this drive seems to be.   And yet, it appears to work."
EmDrive,3av604,hms11,2,Wed Jun 24 12:07:13 2015 UTC,The EMDrive space plane can levitate at any altitude. But in doing so it consumes a lot of liquid gas coolant and ablative entry may be lower cost.

EmDrive,3av604,Sledgecrushr,4,Tue Jun 23 21:30:26 2015 UTC,"See that doesn't make sense. If it is powerful enough to lift the craft, you could just have another emdrive pointing back, right?"
EmDrive,3av604,smckenzie23,4,Tue Jun 23 22:49:30 2015 UTC,"If it was powerful enough to lift the craft at 1g then going into space would be a trivial matter, just keep flying up.  The problem is that researches appear to be finding thrust with EM drives its just very small thrust.   And with a very small thrust EM drive you would still have to rely on a rocket to get you into space and achieve an orbit.  After the rocket does its work the small thrust EM drive would slowly but steadily propel you at a constant acceleration to your destination.  I believe a craft weighing in at 1000 kilograms would require 9800 neutons of propulsion to lift it at sea level on earth.  The em drives right now are only producing a fraction of a neuton of propulsion.(if that isnt just a laboratory error)"

EmDrive,3av604,Zouden,2,Tue Jun 23 20:11:35 2015 UTC,"No, I don't think so. The problem is this use-case relies on the math initial proposed by the inventors, who supposed far more thrust/watt than what was actually measured. Currently, with the amount of thrust per watt measured, EM drive will not be useful for anything other than open space work.  Also, atmospheric breaking is pretty damn efficient, it requires no energy on the craft, just weight(for shielding)."
EmDrive,3av604,Deeviant,1 point,Tue Jun 23 22:23:00 2015 UTC,Shawyer has proposed a spaceplane that gently accelerates to achieve orbit and does the same to land.  Being able to levitate changes access to space and coming home to the surface.
EmDrive,3av604,TheTravellerEMD,5,Wed Jun 24 03:16:10 2015 UTC,"Em drive does not allow one to ""levitate"", it is a ""reaction-less drive"", one with a pretty poor energy/thrust ratio. That's assuming the force is real anyways, and not some affect that only works in a non or pseudo vacuum.  It is far more efficient to use something like a ramjet intro-atmosphere since the reaction mass is already there and you get energy/thrust ratio orders of magnitude greater than the measured ratio of the EM drive.   As I said before, the EM drive, if it works in at all, really shines in open space, where a craft just needs to acquire(solar power) or generate(fission/fusion generator) power in order to create thrust, as current space craft have no other recourse other not only generate power but also bring reaction mass and literally fling it out of the craft in the opposite direction of the desired direction of travel in order to create thrust, which is what standard rocket motors or even ion drives do. The math on reaction mass based drives(ie, those that obey current understood physics) works out that you quickly run out of mass, or you need start with an very large mass, which both requires an enormous amount of energy to get off-planet and also requires more thrust to move it in the first place. Reaction mass and energy are often confused, even if you have limitless energy, you still need to use newton's second law to move, you need to throw mass off the craft in order to move, and you just run out of mass eventually.  All the talk regarding intro-atmosphere use of the EM drive was based on the math originally provided by the EM drive's inventor, which was orders-of-magnitude more than what was measured experimentally. Confusion arises because nearly all serious scientists expected absolutely zero thrust from the EM drive, but instead got a very small but measurable amount, then people said, ""hey the EM drive actual works!"", and went back to the original math proposed by the inventor and not the experimentally validated math."
EmDrive,3av604,Deeviant,3,Wed Jun 24 04:00:02 2015 UTC,"To be fair, several models of the EmDrive state that thrust/power ratio is dependent on Q, so by increasing Q a million-fold with a superconductor we can have flying cars and so on. Apparently we'll see evidence of that ""soon"" but I'm not holding my breath."
EmDrive,3av604,Zouden,4,Wed Jun 24 05:14:44 2015 UTC,"Models are (mostly) worthless until they have an analog in reality. Right now, the only part of the EM drive that I trust to live in reality is what Eagleworks has done, and the numbers bear out a very different reality than the model put forth by the EM drive inventor.   The materials to construct an EM drive are trivial. If one can change a dielectric here or Q there and generate massive amounts of thrust, we will know very soon. In fact, it should have happened already. The ""No true Scottsmen"" defense in common in various breaks-laws-of-physics contraptions. You didn't use unobtainable ore this, you didn't tune delta frequency that, if you did it would have surely worked!  Speaking as a student of physics and a dreamer of star trek future proportions, I can't wait for the EM drive to bear out. However, that chances of that are extremely small, if existential at all."
EmDrive,3av604,Deeviant,4,Wed Jun 24 06:23:17 2015 UTC,"I see a lot of that sentiment already... ""the next paper will eliminate all doubts! You'll see!"""
EmDrive,3av604,Zouden,2,Wed Jun 24 06:45:35 2015 UTC,"Eagleworks in doing their design and testing avoided every suggestion Roger Shawyer gave them. He told them using dielectrics would increase losses, reduce Q and reduce thrust.  Here are the results so you can judge:  Chinese 720,000uN SPR 175,000uN Eagleworks 000,030uN  BTW 3ouN is about the force 1 SnowFlake generates landing on the Eagleworks test equipment.  Bet they wished they had listened.  Now Eagleworks is replicating the SPR Demonstrator EMDrive and the SPR Teeter Totter Balance Beam.  Maybe this time they will get significant thrust."
EmDrive,3av604,TheTravellerEMD,2,Wed Jun 24 12:42:49 2015 UTC,"The EMDrive generates Force, not Thrust.  The EMDrive generated Force does Work, moving  a Mass some Distance. The Energy necessary to support the Work done on the Mass comes from the EMDrives power supply. No propellant is burnt and exhausted to gain Thrust, do the Work and be the source of the Energy that did the Work on the expelled fuel."
EmDrive,3av604,TheTravellerEMD,0,Wed Jun 24 05:23:21 2015 UTC,"Levitating a Mass only requires a Force. As the Mass is not moved, no Work is done and no Energy is expended.  As for the Eagleworks measured Forces, they used a dielectric, which Shawyer and the Chinese did not use. Shawyer in fact told EW to not use a dielectric as it increases losses, reduces Q and thrust.  Chinese:  710,000uN - no dielectric  Shawyer: 175,000uN - no dielectric  EW:            000030uN - dielectric  Seems Shawyer was right."
EmDrive,3av604,TheTravellerEMD,4,Wed Jun 24 04:06:08 2015 UTC,"No, levitation does not ""only require a force."" As in many cases, including the case which is most salient to what we are talking about, force requires reaction mass.  The very definition of levitation means your not in contact with anything. In order to levitate you need to generate equal an opposite force as the force of gravity. If you were levitating using a :  1) Propeller. You are using energy to move the propeller which is then using the ambient air as a reaction mass  2) Rock motor. The fuel and reation mass are the same thing here as the fuel burns then shoots out of the rocket, definitely reaction mass required.  3) Magnetic repulsion levitation. This case do not require reaction mass and is the only thing that resembles anything close to what you are talking about. The downside is that this is literally the same thing as simply standing on the ground, and well, it requires a ground, which is not readily available in space or any distance sufficiently far away from the ground as to make Newtonian interaction with the ground impossible.  The EM drive is a special case which really has nothing to do with the concept of levitation although you could use it to levitate. This is the thing we are actually talking about is a reaction-less drive, one with a very poor energy/thrust ratio which would take a very high amount of energy to counteract the force of gravity.  You statements regarding force/energy ratios are scientifically meaningless until they are repeated, which they have not yet been. Neither the Chinese results nor Shawyer's results have ever been repeated. Also, you did not list the energy input, but just the force, so they are doubly meaningless. The absolute value of the force means nothing, only unit force per unit input energy. The Eagleworks experiments have been repeated by amateurs who have been reported un-reviewed data somewhere along the lines of the Eagleworks reports. The raw materials to build an EM drive are next to nothing so you would assume that if it were possible to generate a large amount of force using an EM drive it would have happened by now.  The issue with the dielectric is a red herring until an independent, repeatable, experiment is performed without a dielectric matches either Shawyer's or Yang Juan's results. Yang Juan's result was .750 Newton with 2500 Watts, that the equivalent of ~76 grams, so far out of the range of experiment error a high school student could verify the efficacy of the EM drive, but for some reason it hasn't happened yet. Spoiler alert, it will likely not happen as physics is just a bitch like that."
EmDrive,3av604,Deeviant,1 point,Wed Jun 24 04:41:54 2015 UTC,"Sorry but propellantless levitation only requires a Force to be generated to levitate a Mass. And as the levitated Mass is not moved, no Work is done on the Mass and thus no Energy is required to levitate a Mass using a propellantless EMDrive.  The EMDrive generated Force required for the levitation of a 1kg Mass in a 9.8m/s2 1g gravity field is 9.8N."
EmDrive,3av604,TheTravellerEMD,0,Wed Jun 24 04:54:17 2015 UTC,"So you either refuse to read my post, or don't understand it. Either way, I don't think we can talk about anything productively."
EmDrive,3av604,Deeviant,1 point,Wed Jun 24 05:07:27 2015 UTC,"You need to stop thinking about the EMDrive as a rocket motor. It generates Force, not Thrust."
EmDrive,3av604,TheTravellerEMD,3,Wed Jun 24 05:31:42 2015 UTC,"Trust me, I am well versed in physics. It is you who either refuses or is unable to understand what I have written.   I'm not going to have a conversation with you when I lay what is right there on the table, and you ignore it (and reality) and repeat things that have nothing with what we are talking about."
EmDrive,3av604,Deeviant,2,Wed Jun 24 06:16:59 2015 UTC,"Let me make my point clear.  The EMDrive produces Force and not Thrust.  It is not a rocket.  For the EMDrives generated Force to do Work in accelerating the ship's Mass, the on board power supply must provide Energy to support the Work done on the ship's Mass by the Force working over a Distance.  For the EMDrive 4N is 4 Newtons of Force, not 4N of Thrust.  To levitate a 1kg mass in a 1g gravity field, 9.8N of Force must be applied to the bottom of the 1kg Mass.  As the 1kg Mass will not be moved by the 9.8Ns of Force, there is NO Work done by the Force as no Energy is needed as no Work is done.  Of course the EMDrive has losses when generating a Force, such as conversion losses and cavity eddy current losses, which the power supply must generate energy to replace the losses. So there is some energy cost in an EMDrive doing Mass levitation but not that much."
EmDrive,3av604,TheTravellerEMD,1 point,Wed Jun 24 06:59:20 2015 UTC,"We are discussing a diagram of a dynamic system with force vectors drawn and equilibrium reached as TheTravellerEMD explains, right? What's confusing about how he is idealizing the system?  All of your responses connote a strong skeptical/critical tone, which is cool and useful - as you have said, until proper scientific research and review happen - this isn't possible yet.   Yet OP has a point - removing design constraints by altering method of re-entry would be interesting as you could reduce the mass of the spaceship (thereby making levitation easier ;)  ) assuming the EmDrive is proved and improved upon with time. Which would be nice."
EmDrive,3av604,Beers_Man,5,Wed Jun 24 06:43:21 2015 UTC,"What I thought we were talking about, was the viability of the EM drive for atmospheric reentry.  And I laid out many reason why this, with the data we currently have, is not only infeasible but most likely impossible.  On top of that, even if the EM drive works, atmosphere reentry is not at all the most interesting use-case for a reaction-less drive. When you enter the atmosphere, you have all the reaction mass you need. You don't even really need to do anything to slow down, just survive and control the decent. If you wanted to talk about a reaction-less drive in regards to atmospheric reentry, a more logical line of though would probably be that you could use it slow your space vehicle down before entering the atmosphere, reducing the heat/force load on the heat shield.  Frankly, if the EM drive was powerful enough to act as a reentry break, the conversion should not how to use it with reentry, but how to use it to colonize/explore/commercialize our solar system, or perhaps even to start planning the first trip out of the solar system."
EmDrive,3av604,Deeviant,1 point,Wed Jun 24 06:56:33 2015 UTC,"I agree with everything you said... But think about this... What happens when you have an huge ship, i.e. orders of magnitude bigger than the space station. Shielding is not possible(at least very difficult) in such big structure, if we want to build a big enough ship to colonize and have an long range machine capable of supporting hundred of people, labs, dorms, etc, we need that ship to reentry atmosphere and land if possible. Think of an emergency, the ship needs to land somewhere and if does not have shields it will be a certain catastrophe."

I have no idea how large these are, but lets arbitrarily say 10kg (I would actually appreciate this number being corrected) which would mean we would need a 138 times increase in force produced for this to even allow itself to hover on the surface of the earth let alone a space ship."

EmDrive,3av604,startingtoquestion,1 point,Sun Jul 5 06:54:09 2015 UTC,What does Shawyer believe the maximum thrust was again? I could have sworn I saw his predictions for the device scaled up to maximum efficiency and it was still significantly less thrust then would be needed to overcome earths gravity while lifting anything even close to the mass of a ship.
EmDrive,3av604,TheTravellerEMD,1 point,Fri Jun 26 00:26:12 2015 UTC,There is no known max Force generation. Just very high Force EMDrives may have acceleration limits due to Doppler shifts inside the drive moving the cavity outside resonance. Tricky things very high Q cavities.
EmDrive,3av604,asteng92,2,Thu Jul 2 00:23:08 2015 UTC,"With sufficient thrust and energy/fuel any propulsion system could facilitate a slow reentry, and it wouldn't even have to achieve orbital velocities to stay in space.  Think of the difference between airplanes and helicopters.  The vertical thrust of a helicopter allows it to move in any direction or even hover for extended periods while most aircraft must maintain forward velocity to provide lift.  Current spacecraft, due to power and fuel limitations, must maintain orbital velocity to stay, um, in orbit.  With sufficient thrust (equivalent to a helicopter) and fuel, spacecraft could behave more like helicopters or V-22s both in and out of the atmosphere.  The cost question depends significantly upon the characteristics (cost, weight, safety, etc.) of the fuel or power supply.  If a nuclear reactor, as we make them today, is required, the risk of an accident may not exceed the benefit of slow reentry.  Otherwise, yeah, slow reentry eliminates many technical issues, reduces weight, reduces turn around time between launches, etc."

So de-orbiting involves a fair amount of atmospheric braking.   Now all of this is predicated on prior 'experience' with chemical rocketry, the ballistics of which must be optimized for the fuel carried and consumed along the way.  This would not be the case with the emdrive, who's mass would remain relatively constant throughout it's mission. The dynamics of 'flight' per a device such as the emdrive may require  an overhaul of spaceflight mechanics if not an overhaul of physics.  EDIT: speeling"

If  you think the voyage times here   http://emdrive.wiki/Potential_EMDrive_solar_system_explorer_ship  look good, well lets just say they need to be revised downward quite a bit.

Once you're at the stage of submitting the paper, it should already be very strong - negative peer reviews can be lethal to the paper.  Iterating (or arguing) with the reviewer isn't a thing - they're only reviewing the paper, not helping you write it.  If you screw up, often times you'll not only want to strengthen the paper, but look for a different journal to submit to.  One of the papers here had just worded things too similarly to another paper (they used similar techniques to prove different things).  A reviewer apparently got confused, thought the new paper wasn't showing anything new, and rejected it.  No second chance - you can grumble and complain, offer a professional version of ""hey, that review sucks, don't use that person again"", but then you've still gotta find a different journal.

I've seen him work through some very tough problems and I think even better than RS could have done. I don't think he is RS. Way too different in so many aspects. I think we can drop this as it's getting silly over the top conjecture.

He still hasn't shared how to get proper antenna placement and good antenna designs to excite various mode.  Still some magic going on there.  Sea-Shells idea to use a fine mesh may be a really good idea as then simple to move the antenna position and via a non conducting rod to move the antenna end around inside the cavity while being able to see it.

EmDrive,3artmu,UnclaEnzo,4,Tue Jun 23 07:17:29 2015 UTC,"With a fine copper mesh it should be a great plasma show (grins). It has to be easier to fabricate than solid copper sheeting, not as costly and time consuming. How simple can you get, just cut it out with shears. Great idea.  Microwaves are nothing to play around with. Mess up and you might not even know you did, you could go blind or sterile, cause nerve damage and this stuff will even kill you, nasty stuff so you're smart TTEMD wearing detectors. That was the first thing I bought even before I started building mine plus I'm setting up a double caged wire mesh with mine.   Building a high power Frustum capable of storing and then focusing thousands of watts of energy and projecting that beam great distances you need to be careful and know what your doing! This is to those here who think that they are going to stick a microwave magnetron into a old paint can to see what happens... DON""T."
EmDrive,3aszsg,TheTravellerEMD,2,Tue Jun 23 07:10:02 2015 UTC,"Frankly, number 1 seems to be a pretty obvious mistake in the appendix - quoting the paper...   ""The change in kinetic energy [...] is the initial kinetic energy minus the final kinetic energy""   ...but ""change"" is final minus initial, not initial minus final.  Regardless, his example calculation apparently shows that the initial KE is bigger than the final KE (the opposite of what the text says).  Of course that's still a discrepancy - but he doesn't include the (final) KE of the ""exhaust"".  That will make up for it I'd presume?

Compare against the just above Saturn one way mission at 4N/kW (9.1milli-g). Massively reduced Earth to Saturn time using 4N/kW EMDrives.  Yes it is exciting times."
EmDrive,3aszsg,venomae,4,Tue Jun 23 08:14:48 2015 UTC,"You mentioned in the post about Shawyers paper that the effectivity of the engine might go up quite a bit and reduce the times needed for the estimated space travel - can you please elaborate what kind of improvement / reduction are we talking about? As in, tenths of percents for example?"
EmDrive,3aszsg,venomae,5,Tue Jun 23 10:09:09 2015 UTC,"Dr. White started at 0.4N/kW which for the IXS Clark is acceleration at 0.91n-g. Then upgraded to 4N/kW = 9.1m-g acceleration.  In Roger Shawyers latest public paper he is talking min 100N/kW but that is a superconducting drive, which may need too many support systems for deeo space use.  Would suggest 40N/kW is doable for a non superconducting IXS Clark drive. Acceleration would then be @ 91m-g or close to 0.1g.  Saturn transit time:  0.4N/kW, 0.91m-g, 263 days 4.0N/kW, 9.1m-g, 86 days 40N/kW, 91m-g, 28 days (my estimate)  28 days, one way to Saturn, not bad."
EmDrive,3aszsg,Taven,8,Tue Jun 23 12:17:20 2015 UTC,"Holy shit - that sounds like pure sci-fi dream.

Thanks for the info - I don't really believe it right now before we get some hard data but the optimist in me would wish this to come true so much."
EmDrive,3aszsg,Zouden,3,Tue Jun 23 12:47:36 2015 UTC,"By the time these engines would reach space through development and testing, I imagine they'd be incredibly refined. Just the first jump in thrust from first generation to second generation is huge. How many days would it be for the superconducting 100N/kW just out of curiosity?  And in that new peer review paper you said these times would be adjusted lower even further. Is it even lower than the numbers you've given above?  You also mentioned you feel Shawyer may be close to a levitating device. Being terrible at math, does this imply that EmDrive would have 1g force?   Also for the fun of it, if you're up to it - how many days to Mars? (As I imagine that's an even more attractive target)"
EmDrive,3aszsg,LoreChano,5,Tue Jun 23 13:47:29 2015 UTC,"You also mentioned you feel Shawyer may be close to a levitating device. Being terrible at math, does this imply that EmDrive would have 1g force?    No it means it has 1g acceleration, which requires a force of 9.8 newtons for every kg of engine mass. If the engine and battery pack weighs 100kg, it will need 980 newtons to levitate.   At 100N/kW that's 9.8kW which, I think, can be generated from a battery pack of that size. So it could levitate if it is indeed that efficient."
EmDrive,3aszsg,hms11,2,Tue Jun 23 14:18:46 2015 UTC,Cant say.  But I have read 1g is possible. Which would be just a few days to Mars.
EmDrive,3aszsg,SirKeplan,1 point,Tue Jun 23 14:23:43 2015 UTC,"The speed would be immense. If the ship miss the planet's orbit, it could lost itself in space forever. Normal to happen in probe missions, but not so good for a crewed ship."
EmDrive,3aszsg,hms11,9,Tue Jun 23 14:45:47 2015 UTC,"Really, that becomes far less of a problem with a 1g EMdrive. At 1g, space almost becomes point and shoot. Missed mars? Oh well, turn around and try again, it's not like you are going to run out of fuel, and 1g means you have gravity, so far, far less physical problems with human crews.   The speed becomes more dangerous for collisions sure, but actually missing the orbit becomes less important, you are not concerned about fuel consumption."

EmDrive,3aszsg,LoreChano,1 point,Tue Jun 23 18:01:43 2015 UTC,With 1g IXS Clark can easily and quickly get anywhere it wants to go. Ok sure need to flip the ship half way there and decelerate but that is assumed.

An order of magnitude better performance for the non superconducting drive would make many inter system missions practical, certainly for robots and almost definitely humans as well. Gotta wonder if the .1 Gs will stave off just enough of the negative effects of zero G. Since the ship is presumably constantly under thrust.  How long has this paper been in peer review? Any idea when it will be public?"

EmDrive,3aszsg,LoreChano,2,Tue Jun 23 14:27:07 2015 UTC,Dumb question: Why wouldn't increasing the N/kW ratio by 10x also decrease travel time 10x? The figures in this link point to a reduction to ~30%.
EmDrive,3aszsg,LoreChano,2,Tue Jun 23 13:46:55 2015 UTC,"In layman's terms, if the SPEED were increased by 10X, the time reduction would be reduced by a factor of 10. But, it is ACCELERATION that is increased by 10X, which linearly increases speed, thus linearly decreases time."
EmDrive,3aszsg,Monomorphic,2,Tue Jun 23 15:07:50 2015 UTC,"And by linearly, I mean it could be exponentially, linearly, or something else entirely that I don't understand, but not standard 1:1."

Is he saying that the scale weighed less without the device actually being on the scale? So it made the ceramic tiles weigh less simply by being near them?  This has to be microwave interference with the scale. The alternative would imply it's generating a gravity well. Could any other effect be causing this?"
EmDrive,3arw61,Taven,8,Tue Jun 23 02:35:39 2015 UTC,"This is confirmed on the next page, there was no contact between the waveguide and the scale.  The test should have produced no thrust. Radio frequency interference is the suspected cause, but there are indications it may be something else. If no ceramic tiles are on the scale, no weight variation was detected, which rules out simple RFI.  Very interesting indeed."
EmDrive,3arw61,lmbfan,7,Tue Jun 23 04:21:01 2015 UTC,"That is disappointing. He also says:   Also, the tests done in the ""down"" orientation show much less force, though still in the ""weighs less"" direction.  This may be due to the better RF sealing on the fixed end which is down in the ""down"" orientation.   My takeaway from this is we cannot use electronic scales to test the EmDrive."
EmDrive,3arw61,Zouden,4,Tue Jun 23 06:59:46 2015 UTC,"Later on he says:   Though my experience with RFI is that it is usually much more dramatic/noisy/unpredictable.    This is a remarkably consistent and reproducable effect.   It could be magnetic, but as Imbfan pointed out no weight variation was detected when the ceramic tiles were removed.   Very strange!"
EmDrive,3arw61,Taven,9,Tue Jun 23 08:02:59 2015 UTC,He also says that that could be due to the high-load compensation by the scales. I'm inclined to believe that more than the idea that the EmDrive is a gravity engine.
EmDrive,3arw61,Zouden,4,Tue Jun 23 08:05:29 2015 UTC,Same here!
EmDrive,3arw61,Taven,2,Tue Jun 23 08:07:10 2015 UTC,What is high-load compensation? I haven't heard of that term before now.
EmDrive,3arw61,BlaineMiller,6,Tue Jun 23 14:46:43 2015 UTC,Neither had I. It's apparently something that his particular scale does when it has a heavy load on it. Perhaps it uses a different set of strain-gauge load cells which are more sensitive to RF interference.

As for the positive results with a dielectric, it makes me wonder about the proper theory for an emdrive.

EmDrive,3aph0k,TheTravellerEMD,6,Tue Jun 23 18:05:02 2015 UTC,"It would seem the mention of fraud related to Roger Shawyer is a bit over the top and completely false as per the following.  http://forum.nasaspaceflight.com/index.php?topic=37642.msg1390764#msg1390764  http://forum.nasaspaceflight.com/index.php?topic=37642.msg1390769#msg1390769  As to the increased length for the EW frustum to resonate at 2.45GHz, that suggestion originally came from my spreadsheet analysis which showed the EW frustum would not resonate in any mode at 2.45GHz.  Some time later Dr. Rodal agreed the length needed to be longer."
EmDrive,3aqg3f,ReisGuy,11,Mon Jun 22 17:53:25 2015 UTC,"Hi!  1) According to MiHsC, the EmDrive moves forward because the photons inside have more inertia when they bounce off one end. The energy comes from the zero point field, but it is proportional to the number of photon bounces (which is in turn dependent on the input power and the Q factor). As the ship approaches the speed of light, the mass increases, which means it would require more energy (photon bounces) to accelerate it. Unless we input more power, acceleration will slow down as it approaches C, consistent with other forms of propulsion. The speed of light is still a formidable barrier. That said, MiHsC predicts that there is actually a ""minimum acceleration"" that all objects are subject to, and this could enable things to exceed the speed of light. It is too weak to be of any particular use, I think.  2) If an object gains ""fixed amounts of kinetic energy"" per unit of time, then its acceleration must be decreasing. The proof is very simple:   ke = 1/2mv^2 #start with kinetic energy formula v^2 = 2ke #assuming m is constant v = sqrt(2ke)    Hence, as ke increases linearly with time, v will increase more slowly. TheTraveller asked what I think would act to slow down the EmDrive's acceleration. My answer is: nothing, there is nothing to slow down the EmDrive's acceleration (that would violate relativity), so the above scenario is impossible. The premise is wrong: the engine does not generate kinetic energy in a linear manner.  If we look to MiHsC, the EmDrive generates force in a linear manner, and the energy comes from the zero point field. This is the only explanation I know that doesn't have giant holes in it."
EmDrive,3aqg3f,Zouden,6,Mon Jun 22 20:57:22 2015 UTC,Beautiful. Thanks for the elucidation of those points.
EmDrive,3aqg3f,God_Emperor_of_Dune,8,Mon Jun 22 22:21:37 2015 UTC,"I don't understand how he says ""no new physics is needed"" and then essentially puts forth an idea that violates current physics: passing the speed barrier with essentially infinite kinetic energy. I agree that MiHsC currently holds the best explanation for the alleged thrust being generated."
EmDrive,3aqg3f,LoreChano,2,Mon Jun 22 21:06:24 2015 UTC,"I don't think Im saying bullshit when I say if something can accelerate from 1 km/h to 2 km/h without outside help, it can accelerate to 500, 1000, 100.000 km/h. speed is a question of relation. Is it 1, 2 and 100.000 km/h in relation to what?"
EmDrive,3aqg3f,Zouden,8,Mon Jun 22 19:00:06 2015 UTC,"Yes, relativity says there's no universal reference frame, and so an object in space doesn't know how fast it's moving. The engine should work just as efficiently regardless of its speed."
EmDrive,3aqg3f,TheTravellerEMD,3,Mon Jun 22 21:02:30 2015 UTC,"An EMDrive ship obeys A = F/M as per it's local inertial reference frame. As long as the EMDrive generates F, the ship will continually accelerate, obeying A = F/M and eventually have more KE, to a non moving observer, than the ships EMDrives generated. However on the ship, all is well as the ship ignores any external reference plane apparent CofE violation.  On the ship, the onboard nav system will announce to the crew when it reaches 1 c and the champagne corks will pop. However their time reference frame has slowed and to an external observer, while the ship is moving quite quick, it is not exceeding 1 c. The crew will pay for the cork poping as upon returning home, a LOT of time has passed and their family is either aged or long since dead.  BTW at a constant 1g acceleration, it will take the EMDrive ship a little under 1 year to reach 1c, according to the ships on board nav system. In reference to a distant non moving observer, the ship will never reach 1c.  But to the crew, they can accelerate at 1g half way there, flip the ship, decelerate at 1g for the same time and arrive at a distant star in a few years. CodE violation be damned."
EmDrive,3aqg3f,Zouden,2,Tue Jun 23 00:46:52 2015 UTC,"Thank you for taking the time. I think I get the gist, but may still be a bit off.  If the EmDrive generates constant acceleration, then eventually the ship will have ""created"" more KE than was ever put into the system (related to the EmDrive's lack of propellant/exhuast). I think you two are both saying this?  Hence the free energy machine alarm, and ""apparent CofE violation""?  So, according to Zouden according to MiHsC, no violation has actually occurred because the KE is not being created by the EmDrive, but is rather a force being cultivated from the ZPF - like a sail? So the force can be generated at a constant, linear rate with no problem.   So the only difference my questions picked between you and Zouden is simply whether a CofE violation is happening?   TheTraveller, you say yes - violation is happening and leave it at damn CofE?   Zouden, you say no - the energy is coming from the ZPF?   Zouden, if the energy is coming from the ZPF and the drive can still generate force in a linear manner in excess of the KE put into the system - the drive would still be a free energy machine? Like a sail ready to catch a wind that is always blowing at the same steady pace?"
EmDrive,3aqg3f,JesusIsAVelociraptor,3,Tue Jun 23 14:28:59 2015 UTC,Yes it would be functionally equivalent to a free energy machine because the ZPF is enormous. The crucial difference is that it doesn't actually violate CoE. I think this aspect of the invention would have a bigger impact than the space travel application.
EmDrive,3aqg3f,Zouden,3,Tue Jun 23 18:12:24 2015 UTC,"If it is actually possible that this drive can just continuously accelerate, then what stops somebody from attaching it to a turbine in space and speeding it up to the point that it generates more power than is uses and creating an actual free energy machine?"
EmDrive,3aqg3f,TheTravellerEMD,3,Wed Jun 24 04:11:53 2015 UTC,If MiHsC is correct then we can indeed do that and EmDrive ships will be self powered.
EmDrive,3aqg3f,emptypisspot,1 point,Wed Jun 24 05:04:21 2015 UTC,I dont think anybody really knows what will happen when the CofE point is reached.  Some say it will never happen as the EMDrive just cant be real.  Some say the ship will ignore CofE and continually accelerate.  Some say ZPE will provide the additional energy needed to enable continual acceleration.  Time will tell which is right or maybe provide other way for the ship to avoid the CofE Paradox.

EmDrive,3aphun,ervza,4,Mon Jun 22 21:01:26 2015 UTC,"As the person who posted that video of sound moving bottles it might seem like I'm proposing that space is a fluid. I certainly considered that idea for the hell of it, but I also came up with lots of my own objections to the idea very quickly.   However, if I were to humor the idea for a moment I'd have a few things to say about it.   It lines up quite nicely with some theories about frame dragging that says space itself can be moved or ""flowed"" at speeds approaching or surpassing C around massive spinning objects. Due to general relativity, my intuition says a space-like vortex might interact with momentum with blatant disregard for reference frame, that is to say I think it would take momentum to create one but maybe it wouldn't readily impart that momentum onto objects it interacts with in an equal and opposite way. In other words our frustum is an open system and doesn't need a hole for the vortexes to exit through. If space is a fluid, matter certainly isn't a solid floating inside the fluid the same way those bottles are solids. Matter is something different entirely that can't interact with the fluid directly, otherwise we'd make space ships with propellers on them. If EM waves interact with the fluid, then a resonant cavity might be our best option for making thrust. If space is a fluid, matter is like a pigment embedded in said fluid and interaction with the fluid is difficult."
EmDrive,3aphun,splad,3,Mon Jun 22 19:54:35 2015 UTC,"There was some experiments where NASA shined a laser through a EMdrive cavity and found it warped space in some way. There is something else that warps space, ""gravity"" or rather, all matter and energy.    All objects in space interacts with each other through the bending of space that gravity causes.  My current theory is that an emdrive pushes off all objects around it through gravity.  If true, an emdrives energy efficiency would change depending on it's movement relative to other massive objects close to it.  ""Back to the future"" predicts that we will have flying cars in 2015.  For that reason I decided to be optimistic.  Anti gravity-or-bust"
EmDrive,3aphun,ervza,2,Mon Jun 22 22:05:41 2015 UTC,"Well if we are thinking of space as an aether, then the warped path of a photon can be thought of the same as if it had passed through any dielectric medium. Clearly in this thought experiment IF photon path length changes were measured, it should be because our frustum is doing something to change the dielectric nature of the aether inside. In essence you might say it is powered by gravity or you could say it is an aether thruster, they might mean the same thing.  What if matter is just vibrations and rotations of the aether? Then you can think of acceleration as those vibrations being rotated in the direction of space-like movement (as apposed to time-like movement) thus their max speed would be the speed of wave propagation through the aether (c) and at that speed they could no longer have internal vibrations or motion which means relativistic time-dilation effects. In this case, acceleration due to gravity is the same as acceleration due to changing the energy density of space inside a frustum and our EMdrive effectively creates warped spacetime/gravity."
EmDrive,3aphun,splad,1 point,Mon Jun 22 22:36:14 2015 UTC,"Whoa.  That is an absolutely huge idea.   What if matter is just vibrations and rotations of the aether?   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3xLuZNKhlY  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc6QPNUqls  These videos probably sums up all I know about that kind of things at the moment, and it suggest all matter is probably from stored up energy contained in some type of ""field"".  If the EMdrive does warp spacetime/gravity, it could present a way for simple repeatable experiments that might allow us to learn how gravity and inertia works at the quantum scale.  It might be the key to a ""Theory of Everything""."

However, it presents a pretty sane, down to earth perspective on how things like matter and gravity might arise from EM waves alone and if you can stand the presentation it's a pretty neat theory.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ptpudk2198  ALSO there is this website which is like a time machine to the early days of the internet, but it also has lots of interesting details about photon theory."
EmDrive,3aphun,Zouden,1 point,Tue Jun 23 18:53:25 2015 UTC,Very interesting! This will probably cost me a night of sleep… I can’t image how difficult it would be to simulate fluid space on a computer just to see how it works.
EmDrive,3aphun,Zouden,3,Mon Jun 22 21:38:58 2015 UTC,"Let's not just assume that the drive is pushing against Aether, since there is no other way of proving that such a thing even exists (which doesn't mean it can't exist).  Once consistent thrust is generated with a drive, multiple tests should be carried out to determine exactly where forces are concentrated within and around the device. Then additional theories can zero in on the exact cause of why the drive works.  While the concept of Aether would be convenient(even though the original ideas were flawed), without data to back up its existence, you could also claim that the em-drive is fueled by love and happiness. The end results would be the same."
EmDrive,3ap908,UnclaEnzo,6,Mon Jun 22 11:39:56 2015 UTC,"I suspect the biggest issue will be heat. We're talking hundreds of kilowatts if we want to move a manned spacecraft, so the electrical components will have to be extremely efficient. We can't use fans to cool them in space, so an EmDrive ship will have to have giant heatsinks."
EmDrive,3ap908,Zouden,1 point,Mon Jun 22 11:58:39 2015 UTC,Will heatsinks really do any good without some sort of refrigeration process? What about recycling the heat for electricity?

That can only be achieved with a heatsink. If the heatsink is on one side of the ship it will actually generate a small amount of thrust as in a photon rocket ;)"
EmDrive,3ap908,wizzor,2,Mon Jun 22 12:47:24 2015 UTC,"Obviously though, there need to be more than one heatsink, on different sides of the ship. This, so the side facing the sun doesn't happen to have the sink, and heat start to accumulate. Still, this is already solved in our current spacecraft, so I don't imagine it's a giant problem."
EmDrive,3ap908,TheTravellerEMD,3,Mon Jun 22 13:58:40 2015 UTC,"Each EMDrive on the IXS Clark will be powered by a 100kW microwave generator. Assuming a non superconducting cavity with a Q of 100k, there will be 10GWs of energy stored inside each EMDrive. With 10 EMDrives per side, that is 100GWs of stored energy very close to each orher. I would want to be a long way away from that much stored energy as some is sure to leak out."
EmDrive,3ap908,ImAClimateScientist,6,Mon Jun 22 14:45:51 2015 UTC,"It would constantly be leaking out as heat at a rate of 100 kW once the cavity reached a steady state. 100 kW is about the same power output as a Ford Focus.  Depending on how the EmDrive actually worked, some of this might be dissipated as kinetic energy.   100 GJ (GWs is a fairly ridiculous unit) is about the same energy as  16 barrels of oil."
EmDrive,3ap908,wizzor,2,Mon Jun 22 18:02:49 2015 UTC,Why would GW be more ridiculous than kW?
EmDrive,3ap908,ImAClimateScientist,2,Mon Jun 22 19:37:15 2015 UTC,"A joule (J) is a unit of energy. A watt (W) is a unit of power (energy per time) and is defined as one joule per second (J/s). GWs is redundant way of saying gigajoules because 1 GW * 1 second  = 1 GJ.  Or, TheTraveller was confusing energy and power and simply meant GWs as the plural of gigawatts."
EmDrive,3ap908,wizzor,2,Mon Jun 22 20:32:07 2015 UTC,"I read it as the latter, but you are right, GWs is a ridiculous unit, I thought you meant that as GW being a ridiculous unit :D"
EmDrive,3ap908,Zouden,3,Tue Jun 23 04:48:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah, and even if each microwave source is 90% efficient (a very generous estimate compared to magnetrons), that's 10kW of heat that needs to be radiated, per engine. The heatsinks will be glowing red-hot."
EmDrive,3ap908,TheTravellerEMD,2,Mon Jun 22 14:59:52 2015 UTC,"As will the reactors heat radiators run red hot. Assuming 33% conversion efficiency, generating 2MWe will probably need 6MWt to start with. So 4MWt to radiate."
EmDrive,3ap908,Sledgecrushr,2,Mon Jun 22 15:36:35 2015 UTC,Couldnt you water cool the radiators and then run that hot water over to the dark side of the ship and cool it there.  I iamgine a set of water cooled radiators just under the outside uninsulated skin of the ship.
EmDrive,3ap908,TheTravellerEMD,2,Mon Jun 22 23:26:17 2015 UTC,There are heat radiators between the reactor and the ship with more heat radiators in front of the EMDrive pods.  The artists did tell me Dr. White gave him suggestions on various aspects of IXS Clark but he did not give further details.
EmDrive,3aoa7p,TheTravellerEMD,10,Mon Jun 22 03:48:55 2015 UTC,Huh? The ion drive is a rocket and therefore the kinetic energy of the propellant has to be taken into account. It's called the Oberth effect.  Honestly I'm surprised that you aren't familiar with this. Surely this was discussed on the NSF forum?
EmDrive,3aoa7p,Zouden,5,Mon Jun 22 07:09:07 2015 UTC,I believe this may be a rather public case of clutching at straws.
EmDrive,3aoa7p,Emdrivebeliever,2,Mon Jun 22 08:38:32 2015 UTC,"What straws? Dr. White is correct. Ion drive spacecraft  can experience the Paradox. You doubt that?  I do disagree with Dr. White when he states there will come a point where the spacecraft will experience a drop in acceleration as gained kinetic energy from increased velocity has matched accumulated power supply energy usage and further acceleration must reduce to ensure CofE is not exceeded.  I mean what the? Are there CofE cops flying around the verse, stopping CofE breakers?"
EmDrive,3aoa7p,Rowenstin,6,Mon Jun 22 15:16:40 2015 UTC,He doesn't include in the calculation the kinetic energy of the propellant! What is doing at NASA  a guy who can't do high school level physics?
EmDrive,3aoa7p,Rowenstin,1 point,Mon Jun 22 10:58:30 2015 UTC,What ship's velocity should Dr. White use to calc the KE of the ship's fuel mass? Relative to what distant constant velocity observer? Could be an anything from 0km/s to light speed.
EmDrive,3aoa7p,Rowenstin,3,Mon Jun 22 15:21:04 2015 UTC,"Different observers will disagree on the initial kinetic energy of the ship, but that's not a problem. However, all observers will measure the same work done on the closed system of the ship and propellant and agree that energy is conserved."
EmDrive,3aoa7p,Rowenstin,-1,Mon Jun 22 16:14:58 2015 UTC,"If the ship's local inertia reference frame obeys A = F/M (as it will) and continually accelerates, at some point of continual acceleration, CofE will be broken."
EmDrive,3aoa7p,Rowenstin,3,Mon Jun 22 16:43:52 2015 UTC,"No it won't. Suppose a 100 kg astronaut that propels itself by throwing backwards a 1 kg ball at ΔV=-10 m/s.   For an observer initially at rest with the astronaut his final speed  will  be 0,1 m/s. His momentum will be 10 kgm/s, and the ball's -10 kgm/s so momentum is conserved. The astronaut's kinetic energy will be 0,5 J, and the ball's kinetic energy is 50 J. Total energy of the system is 50,5 J that comes from the astronaut's arm.  Now for an observer that's moving towards the astronaut at 100 km/s, initial kinetic energy is going to be different: 5,05 x 1011 J. He'll measure the astronaut's final speed at 100000,1 m/s and the ball at 99990 m/s, with energies of 500001000000,5 J  J and 4999000050 J respectively, for a total of  505000000050,5  J. Now, if you subtract the initial kinetic energy from this you have a total of 50,5 J added to the system from the astronaut's arm. This is possible because while the ship has gotten a lot of energy, from the point of view of this new observer the propellant loses kinetic energy so the total is conserved.  Now, if that doesn't satisfy you, you can look for any 15 year old who has not gotten an F in physics to generalize it for any mass and velocity so you can check that V0 doesn't appear in the final equation so it's independent on the observer. Then have some reading on Noether's theorems and check that if energy and momentum are not conserved then symmetries of time and space are broken and what does that imply."
EmDrive,3aoa7p,Zouden,-1,Mon Jun 22 17:34:26 2015 UTC,"What propellant? EMDrives don't use propellants.  To the EMDrive powered ship, it will never stop accelerating as long as the EMDrives are delivering Force."
EmDrive,3aoa7p,Zouden,3,Tue Jun 23 02:58:56 2015 UTC,"Who's talking about EmDrives here? We're discussing White's assertion that regular ion drives break conservation of energy. They definitely do not, as everyone keeps repeating to you, which is worrisome for White's credibility."
EmDrive,3aoa7p,TheNarrMaster,-1,Tue Jun 23 11:59:24 2015 UTC,"That is your opinion but not Dr. Whites opinion.  Have you emailed Dr. White to discuss your opinion?  I have and await his reply.  BTW what Dr.White said is CofE breaking can apply to non EMDrive like force generators as well as EMDrive like force generators. All depends on their N/kW rating and end velocity. He did provide a chart, in Appendix A, which shows this effect. Did you study it?"
EmDrive,3aoa7p,TheNarrMaster,2,Tue Jun 23 12:40:39 2015 UTC,"I read White's document and had a good laugh. It's not my opinion, or everyone else's on this thread for that matter that he's spectacularly wrong, it's math. I provided you an example, that for some reason you choose to ignore, that proves it but if you want I could include proof of how a conventional drive won't ever break CoE as I did to White who's declined to reply."
EmDrive,3aoa7p,ervza,1 point,Tue Jun 23 12:48:55 2015 UTC,"The Oberth effect and continual very low thrust Hall effect Ion thruster do not play well together.  However given a high level, short term thrust, the Oberth effect will happily play it's increased velocity/kinetic effect games."
EmDrive,3aoa7p,ervza,3,Mon Jun 22 15:09:15 2015 UTC,Why does it not work with ion thrusters?
EmDrive,3aoa7p,ervza,0,Mon Jun 22 15:16:24 2015 UTC,It does but the effect is very small. Is why Ion thrusters spiral out from gravity wells and don't do / can't do gravity well dips to gain velocity. Can still do a gravity well drip to change direction without needing a big Dv burn.
EmDrive,3aoa7p,Zouden,1 point,Mon Jun 22 15:26:49 2015 UTC,"Yes, the effect is very small, which is why the Oberth maneuver doesn't make practical sense for ion drives. However the effect is still a crucial part of rocket physics. Ignoring it will result in incorrect calculations, as Dr White has done."
EmDrive,3aoa7p,Zouden,1 point,Mon Jun 22 15:52:18 2015 UTC,Time will tell if Dr. White is correct or not.
EmDrive,3aoa7p,Zouden,0,Mon Jun 22 16:55:12 2015 UTC,"Care to share your Oberth effect inclusive calculations, ref the Dr. White Ion drive example, so I can make further comment?"
EmDrive,3aoa7p,Rowenstin,3,Mon Jun 22 16:16:04 2015 UTC,"Reading Appendix A of the paper  Analysis of Conservation of Energy for Interplanetary Space Missions using Electric Propulsion  it is interesting to see Dr. White giving a classic example of an ION drive powered ship exceeding velocity CofE after 1 year of constant acceleration. What is says is the CofE Paradox is NOT SOMETHING UNIQUE to the EMDrive, so those who use CofE velocity violation as a reason to claim the EMDrive can't work, just lost their position. As Dr. White has shown, an ION powered craft can easily do the same CofE velocity violation.  So you theory guys, instead of saying the EMDrive is impossible because of CofE velocity violation, time to put on your thinking caps and come up with a way to reconcile A = F/M (observer on the ship) and E = 1/2MV2 (non moving external observer) in electric powered continuously accelerating space ships.  Einstein reconciled the Twin Paradox by stating time flows slower for the twin travelling close to light speed. Paradox fixed.  So now how to reconcile the CofE Paradox with electric powered space ships be they Ion, Q Thruster or EMDrive powered."
EmDrive,3aoa7p,sorrge,8,Mon Jun 22 03:53:21 2015 UTC,"After reading the paper, It appears that the final KE of the 540 Kg of propellant wasn't taken into account. The Initial KE of the 540 Kg of propellant while still on the ship was 3.716307x1013 Joules, which is greater than the 3.3649x1013 change in KE of the space-ship. It seems that the gain in KE for the ship can be accounted for with the loss in KE for the propellant. If someone wants to check the math with the impulse and other things like propellant speed integrated over travel time, that would be awesome. These calculations are from the ""at rest"" inertial observers POV. As a side note, I don't think the EM drive is impossible."
EmDrive,3aoa7p,wallofwolfstreet,5,Mon Jun 22 05:09:57 2015 UTC,"Is it not the lost 540kgs of lost propellent mass that gave the spacecraft the acceleration to gain 1km/s of relative velocity increase compared to the background radiation velocity of 371km/s?   In other words, 540kgs of initial propellant had exited the ship by the time  the ship had reached the end velocity of 372km/s.  At start velocity = 371km/s, ship's mass = 10,000kgs. At end velocity = 372km/s, ship's mass = 9,460kgs. Ion drive expelled fuel mass at final 372km/s = 540kgs ."
EmDrive,3aoa7p,sorrge,8,Mon Jun 22 05:36:27 2015 UTC,"Right, I'm not seeing why this busts CoE if the PE of the ship and the KE of the ship and propellant are taken into account. This akin to saying that a normal, bipropellant rocket breaks CoE because it adds X joules to the spacecraft's KE while the fuel pumps only used 0.00001 X joules to provide the reaction. This argument isn't unique to electric powered propulsion.  Edit to add: All I'm trying to say is the Delta KE of the propellant will be negative."
EmDrive,3aoa7p,TheNarrMaster,4,Mon Jun 22 05:43:57 2015 UTC,"What Dr. White shows is the total energy delivered by the ship's power supply, used to accelerate the Ion drives 540kgs of Xenon (I assume) propellant and provide constant acceleration from 371km/s to 372km/s is very much less than the final aquired kinetic energy gain at the final 372km/s velocity.  Which shows the CofE velocity violation Paradox is not EMDrive unique.  BTW I disagree with Dr. White saying some new to physics effect will cause the ship's mass to undergo less acceleration because it somehow knows the point where the kinetic gain from the increased velocity is now at the same energy level as that outputted by the ship's electrical power system and acceleration (velocity increase) must slow to not exceed the total energy output of the ship's power supply."
EmDrive,3aoa7p,TheNarrMaster,3,Mon Jun 22 06:19:57 2015 UTC,"The CoE of an Ion drive will balance as long as you include the energy from the propellant.  When you are only working with just one half the equation, it will continually causes these kinds of paradoxes.    This make me believe that we can't answer these questions untill we know the effect the emdrive has, not just on itself, but on its environment.  The experiment where NASA shined a laser beam through a emdrive suggest it it is affecting space in some way.  We need more experiments like those to answer these questions."
EmDrive,3aoa7p,asteng92,1 point,Mon Jun 22 15:15:45 2015 UTC,"Ion drive propellant is inert, no stored PE there. Look up Xenon. Only the energy from the ship's power supply imparts energy to the Xenon on exhaust."
EmDrive,3al9cw,Emdrivebeliever,10,Sun Jun 21 08:29:21 2015 UTC,"Honestly I think this particular subreddit should be primarily focused on the experiments and the results. Having repeatable data showing real thrust will be a first step. And I don't mean a couple noisy experiments in 3 labs. Once we have irrefutable evidence, the theory will come out in the wash.  Still, I've found the discussion interesting. White's theory sounded perfect (like a propeller pushing on the quantum virtual plasma!) until I learned that there should be no reference frame to push on. I was excited about Shawyer's theory until I saw it puts out way more power than you put into it. Now I'm amazingly psyched about MiHsC (well beyond the emdrive). But who knows.  It is all just speculation until any engineering dept in the world can trivially build an emdrive that produces thrust well above the noise floor, and we aren't there yet.  Overall, I hope people keep looking at the science and the math here. There is no real room for dogma."
EmDrive,3al9cw,smckenzie23,30,Sun Jun 21 19:37:48 2015 UTC,"Agreed. This subreddit should stay as neutral and as skeptic as possible. There have not been enough studies done to confirm the EmDrive produces thrust, let alone how it produces thrust. I realize some people believe one theory over another, but I'd prefer to see this place remain scientifically neutral. If there's information to help builders test their work, it should be compiled together with other data / theory tests and put in the sidebar under a neutral premise. That's what the sidebar is for.  TheTraveller: It's nothing personal - everyone here would like to be as convinced as you but until we know about the information you can't release yet, and/or see Shawyer's peer reviewed work, and/or see Shawyer ride out on a superconducting EmDrive hovertank, we can't be absolutely certain of anything just yet. The data is looking good, and I'm all for ""theory be damned, follow the data"", but we also don't want to get ahead of ourselves and put anyone off.  This device is considered a fringe device by many, so we have to coo scientists gently to stay in our subreddit and take it seriously."
EmDrive,3al9cw,Taven,14,Sun Jun 21 09:56:19 2015 UTC,I think its good that the travelers calculations have been stickied.  I also think Shawyers theories deserve to be studied and discussed.  But also Mcullochs' MiHsC theory needs to be stickied as well because that also deserves to be studied and discussed.  We should certainly keep an open mind on the possibilities presented to us.
EmDrive,3al9cw,Sledgecrushr,2,Sun Jun 21 13:35:54 2015 UTC,Or we should make a MiHsC subreddit.  Discussing it in /r/EmDrive is kind of limiting the scope of potential discussions of MiHsC's impact.

I believe there is room for speculation on the effects of this EM Drive and I was assuming that this Reddit would be a great place where ideas could be disucssed in an adult fashion.  Instead we have a mod who is crusading for just one particular theory and its actually gotten me a bit perturbed.
EmDrive,3al9cw,Sledgecrushr,9,Sun Jun 21 18:01:53 2015 UTC,"Yeah this is absurd. No offense to thetraveler but him saying that we don't need new theory to describe the drive doesn't make it true. Even in the stickied thread he fails to give any evidence that supports what he's saying.

EmDrive,3al9cw,Eric1600,0,Sun Jun 21 12:13:35 2015 UTC,Experimental data is meaningless if it is improperly understood.  This is especially true for something as non-intuitive as electromagnetic and relativity and/or some exotic quantum mechanical effect.  Experiments must be designed based on a principles.  I would say that all the work that has been done on testing Em Drives has mostly just been exploratory demonstrations.  They are not definitive proof of anything yet.

EmDrive,3al9cw,tchernik,4,Sun Jun 21 15:54:39 2015 UTC,"Not true.  Perceptible, repeatable phenomena can be useful with only the slightest theoretical understanding of them.  Fire for example, can be replicated, proved to exist and used without any understanding of the chemical basis of combustion.  People in ancient times simply observed some very basic attributes  required to start it (some things burn, others don't), keep it alive and propagate it, and started using it in prehistorical times long before we had any idea what was behind it.  If this phenomenon is real and tangible, and has some basic behaviors or characteristics describing its strength as the case of fire, we could perfectly start using without the slightest idea of what explains it."

I do understand how the various physical elements such as big end dimension, small end dimemsion, end plate separation, end plate shape, Design factor, excitation mode, Resonant external Rf wavelength, antenna placement, antenna design, impedance matching, cavity Q all go together to make the EMDrive deliver thrust.

There is nothing to support that particular claim. If you don't care about the theory, that's fine, but don't say that and then push a flawed theory as if it's fact."
EmDrive,3al9cw,TheTravellerEMD,1 point,Sun Jun 21 12:05:13 2015 UTC,"The word Thrust is long associated with propellant based rockets, which is not what a propellantless device does. Better to try to avoid confusion and keep thrust associated with rockets and kinetic energy gain with propellantless devices.  Shawyer has confused people using the Thrust word and drawing arrows in the opposite direction normally associated with rocket thrust.  Roger Shawyer made extensive measurements of power flows between various subsystems in his moving & accelerating / decelerating rotary EMDrive test setup. Please read what he reported:   http://emdrive.com/dynamictests.html  Here is what he said:   ""The engine was mounted on a dynamic test rig enabling it to be “flown” on a rotary bearing, as shown in fig 3. The tests simulated the engine moving a 100Kg spacecraft in weightless conditions. The programme included acceleration and deceleration runs in both directions, and confirmed the thrust levels measured in the static tests. The dynamic operation also conclusively proved that the engine obeys all Newton’s laws, and that although no reaction mass is required, the engine is not a reactionless machine. Reaction occurs between the EM wave and the reflector surfaces of the resonator, and the law of conservation of momentum is maintained with the transfer of the momentum of the EM wave to the engine.""   This means some amount of stored cavity energy is converted to kinetic by the above process. Once that happens, the Rf generator refills the lowered cavity energy, increasing energy drawn from the electrical supply which can be measured.  As far as I know, neither the Chinese nor EW have replicated the rotary test rig or the claimed results.  I do intent to replicate a rotary test rig to directly measure acceleration, kinetic energy gain and increased power supply current as voltage will be regulated and fixed."

EmDrive,3al9cw,Zouden,3,Sun Jun 21 15:24:25 2015 UTC,"Because there is a bigger change in kinetic energy when going from 100km/h to 110km/h than there is in going from 50 to 60, does that mean that the EmDrive draws more power at higher velocities?"
EmDrive,3al9cw,TheTravellerEMD,1 point,Sun Jun 21 15:33:44 2015 UTC,"It produces Force which turns into acceleration, then increased velocity, which implies increased kinetic. So I just skip over the middlemen stuff and talk about the end result. A = F/M rules."
EmDrive,3al9cw,Zouden,3,Sun Jun 21 15:42:15 2015 UTC,"Yes, the EmDrive uses constant power to generate constant acceleration and, thus, kinetic energy increases faster than the input energy. We can harness this as a powerful new source of energy."

Even the word ""error"" is not in any of the information you provided.  That's very odd since it's a basic grade school expectation of scientific experiments.    Another thing to consider is that the Chinese are notorious for falsifying data.  What was it, something like 759 out of 1000 falsified experiments last year were from China.    Then we have Eagleworks.  Many, many people work for NASA.  The number right now is 58,000 employees; ~40,000 contractors who ""work"" for NASA and 18,000 full time workers.  Only one person from NASA has commented on this.  And why is that?  because as many scientists and engineers have mentioned, there is no error analysis.  The amount of thrust produced may be within the limits of expected error, but the people working on it can't even produce this basic information.     The Eagleworks group has succeeded in producing, essentially, nothing at all. Their primary mode of communication seems to be on Facebook. NASA officials, when asked by journalists for comment on the claims they leave on websites, remain silent — they don’t want to have anything to do with the whole mess."

That seems like the more important number.  Eg. with fake numbers: 80% of kayakers are white, so this white person must be a kayaker. But really, even though 80% of people who kayak are white, only 3% of white people kayak. So it wouldn't be kosher to assume any white person is a kayaker.  Hope this made sense."

Science is not a country by country statistic.

EmDrive,3akaej,splad,5,Sun Jun 21 01:00:07 2015 UTC,"Well, when they resonate they are actually standing still and not moving.  There are several modes of resonance meaning you get a variety of 3-d patterns that form inside the cavity.  There are several simulations out there, however to the uninitiated they will probably look incomprehensible.  http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2015/04/evaluating-nasas-futuristic-em-drive/  The colors demonstrate the field's intensity at that point on the surface of the structure.  These things are complicated and for most cases have to be modeled by computers running numerical 3-d meshes based on Maxwell's equations.  It's not intuitive at all."

Also on the standing still vs propagating I certainly understand that the resonance would lead to standing waves who's crests and troughs would not move, but wave vs particle aside the radiation still propagates at the speed of light and has to have a start point and an end point inside the frustum right?  Or maybe the idea of photons bouncing back and forth off the walls inside the thing is a poor way for me to think about it. Chambers filled with a medium experience wave nodes independent from the directional source of perturbation, a guitar comes to mind.  This image has already changed how I imagine the thing for better or worse."
EmDrive,3akaej,TheTravellerEMD,3,Sun Jun 21 04:17:32 2015 UTC,"The microwave length is many times longer than say a laser, which would bounce around. But the microwave propogates as standing waves from end to end. Also microwaves propagating inside the cavity have a longer wavelength than they do outside. This is called the guide wavelength and it is calculated from the cutoff wavelength, which depends on the excitation mode and diameter of the cavity.  Google microwave guide wavelength to find out more.   You can download my Excel EMDrive Calculator, which does all the calculations from here:  http://emdrive.wiki/Useful_EMDrive_Design_and_Test_Tools"

EmDrive,3ah1ta,TheTravellerEMD,11,Sat Jun 20 02:47:14 2015 UTC,"Awesome! Thank you for putting together that spreadsheet. And welcome to Reddit! It's great to have you here.  I suppose I do have a question - when will you be able to reveal what exactly has removed that last bit of doubt from your mind that the EmDrive is real? (In reference to this) I imagine you wish to protect sources, but I must say we're all really eager to know! Maybe you could let a hint out? Play hot or cold? Is it a new experiment? Is it an upcoming release of news? Has NASA or Shawyer secretly flown to your house on an EmDrive and taken you on a ride among the stars? We all wish to remove any doubt from our minds - at least tell us how long we must remain in this state of tortured suspense. :)  And as you say you are 100% convinced - there is much talk of the EmDrive being a perpetual motion device and MiHsC points to it as such. Do you believe it is one?"
EmDrive,3ah1ta,Taven,9,Sat Jun 20 03:25:03 2015 UTC,"While I find Mike's theory interesting I refer to both SPR and the Chinese who both say no new physics is needed. Our existing physics is fine, just need to apply it in an unconventional way.  As to perpetual motion claims well anyone making such claims has not done their reading. The EMDrive is not an energy source. It converts stored microwave energy into kinetic energy. Once it does that, it draws on the primary energy source to refill the missing cavity energy.  We understand how an electric current, flowing in a coil can produce a magnetic field and via it's action at a distance, cause kinetic energy flow (movement) in a nearby ferric object.  The EMDrive is no different. Like the coil, it converts energy of one kind into another.  As for why I'm convinced the EMDrive is real, is well as an engineer, after a time you get to feel/understand how a machine works. Studying all the reports on EMDrive thrust, well it felt like a real machine. Then when I developed the calculator, it all fell into place. I now understand how the 6 elements of an EMDrive interact, being the 3 dimensions, Df, excitation mode and frequency.  Then add in the excellent Chinese experimental data and that from SPR (Roger Shawyers company) and EW. It is real and it doesn't violate CofE nor CofM.  Roger Shawyer has said he will be releasing a peer reviewed SuperConducting EMDrive paper in 2015 that was produced with assistance from some of the SPR IP licensees. He normally presents a paper at IAC each year. IAC 2015 this year is mid Oct 2015. Stay tuned for a block buster."
EmDrive,3ah1ta,smckenzie23,12,Sat Jun 20 03:52:29 2015 UTC,"So the thrust per kw listed on Shawyer's site for his 2nd Gen engine is clearly a free energy device. You can generate more power from the thrust than you put in. Not to mention that the build up of kinetic energy would eventually produce more energy than you put in: also free energy. He says that it requires no new physics and doesn't produce free energy, but everything else he says defies that."
EmDrive,3ah1ta,Zouden,2,Sat Jun 20 06:30:55 2015 UTC,"Thrust is just force. You can push your finger into a balloon and feel the force of the increased air pressure inside the balloon pushing back.   If an EMDrive levitates a mass, it is not using any energy to do that as the mass is not moving, not accelerating. The only continual energy drain on the power supply is to make up for inefficiency losses in the various energy conversion subsystems.  When the EMDrive accelerates a mass, the mass gains kinetic energy, which comes from the power supply, driving the Rf generator, which drives the cavity, which loses energy, which is converted into the increased kinetic energy of the accelerating mass.  The EMDrive's resonate cavity is not a creator of energy. It just converts a small fraction of the stored energy into increased kinetic energy of the accelerating mass.  There is no free energy here. Totally conservation."
EmDrive,3ah1ta,Zouden,15,Sat Jun 20 07:12:21 2015 UTC,You're avoiding the actual problem: kinetic energy increases with the square of velocity. That's an enormous amount of energy that you haven't accounted for.   Do you believe the EmDrive operates in a universal reference frame and thus has a top speed? Because that is new physics.
EmDrive,3ah1ta,aysz88,-3,Sat Jun 20 07:52:45 2015 UTC,"I think no one can really answer that question until a long duration EMDrive mission flies.  That said, from the inertial reference frame of the accelerating vehicle, the vehicle will leave the departure space port dock, continually accelerate with a constant energy draw on the primary energy source until midway, turn around, constantly decelerate, again using a constant energy draw from the primary energy source, until it docks with the destination space port and the crew, paxs & cargo deship.  Dr. White, from EagleWorks has already proposed 44 day hops to Mars using constantly accelerating/decelerating EMDrives. Maybe ask him what he thinks?"
EmDrive,3ah1ta,Taven,15,Sat Jun 20 08:11:03 2015 UTC,"Yes, that's an obvious application of the EmDrive and I'm hopeful that we can achieve it.  However it directly contradicts what you've been saying in this thread, which is that the EmDrive cannot accelerate indefinitely and in fact it requires an external source of acceleration to ""charge"" the cavity. So, which is it?   I'm sorry if I sound confrontational, but nothing you've said here has convinced me you have any better understanding than anyone else."
EmDrive,3ah1ta,Zouden,1 point,Sat Jun 20 08:28:17 2015 UTC,"I never said the EMDrive can't continually accelerate. From the inertial reference frame of the ship, it can. However the kinetic energy gain by the ship, per unit of time, will remain constant as the ship's primary energy source has a finite ability to supply energy to the microwave Rf generator, which supplies the cavity, which does the microwave to kinetic conversion. The ship can't gain more kinetic energy, per unit of time, that the ship's power supply can deliver over the same time. .  An EmDrive at rest will stay at rest. In needs some very small motion big end plate to small end plate to initiate acceleration. .  An EMDrive operates in 1 of 3 modes: .  1) Do nothing but get hot from cavity eddy current heating losses. .  2) Enter MOTOR mode from a very small push toward the small end and support acceleration. .  3) Enter GENERATOR mode from a very small push toward the big end and resist acceleration. .  This is not my theory. It is how Roger Shawyer explaing how the EMDrive works."
EmDrive,3ah1ta,oval999,9,Sat Jun 20 09:05:31 2015 UTC,"From these posts (including others in this thread) I think you're misunderstanding what people mean by ""conservation of energy"".   From the inertial reference frame of the ship, it can. However the kinetic energy gain by the ship, per unit of time, will remain constant as the ship's primary energy source has a finite ability to supply energy to the microwave Rf generator, which supplies the cavity, which does the microwave to kinetic conversion. The ship can't gain more kinetic energy, per unit of time, that the ship's power supply can deliver over the same time. .   You cannot use an accelerating reference frame (like the ""reference frame of the ship"") to do math involving kinetic energy, and especially not claim ""conservation of energy"".  In fact the acceleration makes it, by definition, a non-inertial reference frame.  Importantly, an ""inertial reference frame"" is not tied to an object.  It's a point in space moving with constant velocity - perhaps visualize it like a virtual set of coordinate axes projected onto that point in space.  If you start with an ""inertial reference frame"" at the same place/time/velocity/orientation as an object like your ship, and then accelerate the object, you will have pulled the object away from the ""inertial reference frame""!  There is nothing causing the ""inertial reference frame"" to stay with the object in any way, and you cannot use the typical laws of physics with a frame of reference is ""following"" the ship.  You get absurd results if you attempt to use an accelerating frame of reference: the ""kinetic energy"" values of everything else in the universe gets changed by the frame's acceleration.  For example, a spacecraft at rest relative to Earth would see Earth's KE as 0.  Say that the spacecraft then accelerates to 10 m/s.  Now according to the spacecraft, Earth's KE = 1/2 * (mass of Earth) * (10 m/s)2.  If you attempt to compare these two numbers, it appears that Earth gained energy ""by magic"".  However, you cannot compare the two numbers, because you weren't using the same inertial reference frame.  Also, note that to satisfy conservation of energy, you cannot just satisfy it in one frame of reference.  Conservation of energy is a law that is supposed to hold in every inertial frame of reference.  [edit] And I just realized: if you're using a reference frame that follows the ship, the ship's velocity will always be zero relative to that frame, and thus the apparent ""kinetic energy"" will always appear to be zero.  Meanwhile, the rest of the universe seems to be accelerating and gaining kinetic energy!  Yes, you've created a situation where the ship's ""kinetic energy"" is constant - but now the rest of the universe is accelerating!"

EmDrive,3ah1ta,emptypisspot,8,Thu Jul 2 00:40:25 2015 UTC,"As to perpetual motion claims well anyone making such claims has not done their reading. The EMDrive is not an energy source. It converts stored microwave energy into kinetic energy. Once it does that, it draws on the primary energy source to refill the missing cavity energy.   So, how do you explain this? Shawyer's own numbers in his own presentation clearly lead to energy conservation violations by many orders of magnitude. He claims that it doesn't but a trivial energy calculation using his own numbers shows that it clearly does, if it can do what he claims that it can."
EmDrive,3ah1ta,Taven,2,Sat Jun 20 09:28:29 2015 UTC,The power drawn from the reactor per fixed unit of time and converted to increased ship kinetic energy per the reference frame of the ship stays constant. Can't do anything else.  An observer on the ship would see a steady energy usage and conversion to kinetic per fixed local unit of time.  Would you have it work some other way?
EmDrive,3ah1ta,LoreChano,7,Sat Jun 20 14:22:35 2015 UTC,"kinetic energy per the reference frame of the ship stays constant   Kinetic energy in the ship's own reference frame is always zero because it is always at rest in its own reference frame. This is a useless metric. What you want to look at is how kinetic energy changes in other reference frames.  The post I linked to shows that in Earth's frame it will have 6 orders of magnitude more kinetic energy than what the energy source could produce in the given amount of time.   Would you have it work some other way?   It is not about how I ""would have it work"". It is about how it would actually work, if we take Shawyer's numbers to be true. And a simple energy calculation, using those same numbers shows that it gains 6 orders of magnitude more kinetic energy than what the source can produce in the specified time. So, either Shawyer's numbers are nonsense or it is very obviously a free energy machine. Which is it?"

We seriously need to check such concerns at the airlock and see first whether it works. If it doesn't, no need to theorize or explore why. If it does, then we can decide whether there is even any new theory required. As I understand it, there is no need for an overhaul of physics."
EmDrive,3ah1ta,Taven,4,Sun Jun 21 12:42:47 2015 UTC,"I'm only addressing what happens if Shawyer's numbers are correct.  He claims that, given his numbers, final kinetic energy does not exceed energy spent. This is not an experimental claim but a mathematical one. If you are arguing about whether the numbers are right in the first place, this is a valid argument but it's just different from the one I'm addressing here.   ""How it would actually work"" is referring to what would the actual difference be between input energy and final kinetic energy, given Shawyer's numbers for the other variables. There is nothing subjective here, so the question of how ""I would have it work"" is nonsensical. You use his numbers and you get the amount of energy available from the reactor and the amount of kinetic energy gained and then you compare them. That's all you need to do in order to evaluate this particular claim. So, unless you are going to argue that 1019 is smaller than 1013, there is no question that, with his numbers, there is much more kinetic energy gained than energy spent."
EmDrive,3ah1ta,Ree81,1 point,Mon Jun 22 00:53:59 2015 UTC,Wouldn't you see the source producing less energy due to time dilation or are the speeds involved too small to matter?

Although what I meant by my second question is that there are theories that state the EmDrive can be used to build a perpetual motion device; there is a point where more energy can be generated from a device built with the EmDrive than energy used to power the EmDrive. Breaking CoM, CoE. MiHsC seems to say this is the case, but I see that your view is that no new physics are needed and MiHsC is therefore incorrect."
EmDrive,3ah1ta,Ree81,8,Sat Jun 20 04:06:45 2015 UTC,"Actually under MiHsC, the EmDrive doesn't break CoE because it taps into the zero-point field, which we know exists (because of the Casimir effect) and contains so much energy that it's effectively unlimited.  It also doesn't break CoM because the thrust itself is actually a reaction to the photons inside gaining inertia; it would break CoM if it didn't accelerate."

EmDrive,3ah1ta,joeflux,4,Sat Jun 20 07:17:36 2015 UTC,"Mike is trying to explain Inertia with MiHsC. Move power to him for doing that. Just because the 2 major experimenters say no new physics is needed, is not to say Mike's theory of Inertial and how it may apply to the EMDrive is incorrect.  According to the actual experimenters, SPR, the Chinese and EW, the EMDrive is not an energy source (ie not a perpetual motion machine), it just converts microwave energy into kinetic. Both the Chinese and SPR say no new physics is needed. I say that ends any need to search for new physics to explain the EMDrive.  As for why I believe the EMDrive is real, well I believe the experimental data from EagleWorks, SPR and the Chinese is real. The best SPR recorded thrust back in 2009 was 175mN or about 17gf, which you could easily feel in your hand. The best thrust the Chinese got was 710mN or about 70gf, which is very significant. The Chinese used an existing Ion Thruster test system, so unlike SPR or EW, they used a well know and understood low level thrust measuring system that is used to measure many different Ion thrusters.  The thrust is real."

EmDrive,3ah1ta,jpcoffey,0,Tue Jun 23 06:26:06 2015 UTC,In every energy supply chain there always must be an energy source. The EMDrive is not an energy source. All it does is convert microwave energy into mechanical energy.  I would suggest doing what you suggest will not work as the internal microwave will probably not resonate as the cavity will be spinning.
EmDrive,3ah1ta,smckenzie23,3,Tue Jun 23 07:24:03 2015 UTC,The em drive isn't creating energy in this scenario. It's the motor on the device generating energy. There a point where the device is creating more nervy then the em drive is drawing so you end up with free energy.   Why wouldn't the em drive work while spinning? Would the drives end up just pushing on each other and cancelling out each other's thrust? Would the drive be unable to handle the G-force from the spinning motion?   From what I can gather from your other posts the main issue would be that the energy off the back of one drive may push on the front of the other drive changing its operating mode. But to counteract that you would simply have to angle the drive slightly outward.   Sorry. I am just curious. And any technology worth looking in to is coming to come under heavy scrutiny first.
EmDrive,3ah1ta,Perpetualjoke,-1,Tue Jun 23 14:10:06 2015 UTC,"If you put a load on the spinning EMDrive, acceleration stops and the power supply to microwave to mechanical energy conversion chain just turns the generator as the next link in the chain. No free energy."
EmDrive,3ah1ta,smckenzie23,2,Tue Jun 23 14:21:32 2015 UTC,Then how is the em drive supposed to push anything at all? The object the drive is trying to push is always push back on the drive. That's physics 101... So the ship we are trying to push will just stop because it's putting load back onto the drive.

You may be interested to read what I call ""EMDrive for Dummies"" http://s000.tinyupload.com/index.php?file_id=64487691677573925628  It is a simplified EMDrive explanation. Please note the EMDrive WILL NOT MOVE by itself. This is something so simple but almost totally overlooked.  As Roger says in the How to Measure EMDrive thrust document:  http://www.emdrive.com/EmDriveForceMeasurement.pdf  ""A number of methods have been used in the UK, the US and China to measure the forces produced by an EmDrive thruster. In each successful case, the EmDrive force data has been superimposed on an increasing or decreasing background force, generated by the test equipment itself.  Indeed, in the UK when the background force changes were eliminated, in an effort to improve force measurement resolution, no EmDrive force was measured. This was clearly a result of attempting to measure the forces on a fully static thruster, where T and R cancel each other.  UK flight thruster measurements employ this principle to calibrate the background noise on the force balance prior to carrying out force measurements.""  In other words, some external force (vibration is good) has to act on the EMDrive for it to act in either MOTOR or GENERATOR mode. This external force unbalances the otherwise resonant wave fronts and releases a bit of the stored cavity energy as kinetic."

EmDrive,3ah1ta,martinus,2,Sat Jun 20 05:17:25 2015 UTC,"Shawyer's point was as they continued to eliminated external forces, the lower the thrust dropped.  In your kick case, it would continue to operate in Motor mode, assuming you kicked it in the big end. As long as power is applied, the once started acceleration will continue to provide further acceleration or operation in MOTOR mode. If your kick is stronger, higher acceleration, than the EMDrive MOTOR mode can support, it will slow the acceleration to the rate it can convert primal energy to electrical to microwave to kinetic."

The EMDrive has a nonlinear reaction to a force/push applied to each end.   If pushed on the small end, the EMDrive goes into GENERATOR mode and opposes the push, converting the external push kinetic into higher internal cavity energy.  If pushed on the big end, the EMDrive goes into MOTOR mode and converts stored internal cavity energy into external kinetic energy, supporting the external push.

What's interesting about this is that McCulloch does not use a word salad of quantum mumbo-jumbo typical of charlatans. He explains his model very clearly, and it seems like a pretty simple and straightforward extension of ideas raised by Hawking (esp. radiation of black holes) and others.   When lots of huge multi-million dollar experiments have found no evidence for dark matter, I think it makes lots of sense to invest some effort in looking at alternative models. It's still a small chance that the EmDrive will be more than an experimental artifact, but it is very much worth further exploration."

It won't happen because you've removed the mechanism (magnetism) by which they can act.  The photons are that mechanism, the reversible process is the interaction they have with the cavity walls while attenuating and multiplying - that reversible reaction is utilized by the EMDrive while it is in operation with the two sides of it taking place on opposite sides of the cavity producing a net thrust.

No one is swinging on it. Go measure it's relative motion and potential energy. You will find nothing that indicates the dynamic potential to store and release energy in this highly dynamic system.

EmDrive,3aiajn,smckenzie23,4,Sat Jun 20 16:18:20 2015 UTC,Norman L Dean produced machines that created thrust as well.
EmDrive,3aiajn,TheTravellerEMD,-1,Sat Jun 20 19:09:47 2015 UTC,Dean drives don't produce thrust. They need non linear sticktion forces to provide movement.
EmDrive,3aiajn,smckenzie23,3,Sun Jun 21 05:25:51 2015 UTC,"Sure. But he said it produced thrust for a very long time, without a solid theory and not sharing all of his information."
EmDrive,3aiajn,TheTravellerEMD,1 point,Sun Jun 21 05:38:13 2015 UTC,No one replicated Dean and reported sticktion free thrust.  Both the Chinese and EW have built Shawyer like frustums and reported thrust. The Chinese data was peer reviewed and measured on an existing Chinese standard Ion Drive thrust measurement system.
EmDrive,3aiajn,smckenzie23,4,Sun Jun 21 06:07:48 2015 UTC,"Man, I am not trying to say there isn't thrust. Hopefully there is. I'm just saying Shawyer's theory as to why doesn't make sense."
EmDrive,3aiajn,ImAClimateScientist,10,Sun Jun 21 07:04:36 2015 UTC,"Yes, without evidence!!!  There is some evidence that it produces thrust. Although, I'm still far from convinced that it is not a combination of fraud (Shawyer/Fetta) and experimental error.  There is certaintly insufficient evidence to support Shawyer's hypothesis of how it works. There is insufficient evidence to support the mutable quantum vacuum hypothesis of Dr. White.  There is insufficient evidence, so far, to support Mike McCulloch's MiHSC hypothesis for the EmDrive."
EmDrive,3aiajn,smckenzie23,3,Sat Jun 20 16:57:49 2015 UTC,"But the great thing about McCulloch's hypothesis is that not only does it predict thrust from an emdrive, but he has described other unrelated experiments that could confirm the theory."
EmDrive,3aiajn,TheTravellerEMD,0,Sat Jun 20 19:08:16 2015 UTC,"Some evidence?  Shawyer has reported his successful test results.  The Chinese, in a peer reviewed paper have reported their successful results.  EW has reported their successful results on 6 or more very different test devices.  It is real. It works. There is an effect that produces propellantless thrust."
EmDrive,3aiajn,TheTravellerEMD,0,Sun Jun 21 05:08:53 2015 UTC,"Shawyer and Fetta could get quite rich from defamation claims of fraud.  BTW Fettas cavity was designed to run at superconducting temperatures, yet EW tested it at room temperature. For me I find it disturbing for EW to claim no thrust from a device designed to be tested supercooled.  An additional factoid, when EW did test their cavity without a dielectric, they did one reported test at 2.168GHz. On checking their is a cavity resonance at that frequency but the mode was TM012 and their antenna arrangement would not excite that mode.   So the no thrust at 2.168GHz test is invalid as their antenna setup could not excite the resonant mode.  Which means EW botched the Fetta/Cannae test by not using Fettas test protocol and EW botched the non dielectric test by not having the ability to excite TM013 mode."
EmDrive,3aiajn,ImAClimateScientist,3,Sun Jun 21 06:02:12 2015 UTC,"I didn't claim that they frauded anyone. I just said that I'm not convinced yet that it isn't fraud. Nonetheless, its pretty hard to litigate defamation cases in the US, so I'm not really worried about my anonymous internet post.  Shawyer's theory of operation is ridiculous. Either it breaks COE or somehow the device is limited to low velocities (relative to what one might ask). The mutable QV hypothesis, hence the device not actually being reactionless, or the MiHsC hypothesis, hence the device drawing energy from the ZPF, are much more plausible.   There is still insufficient evidence for any of these, but I would strongly advise not following the advice of the OP and to instead design experiments based on the most plausible theories of operation first."
EmDrive,3aiajn,TheTravellerEMD,0,Sun Jun 21 17:42:06 2015 UTC,Dr. White / NASA is saying there is no problem with continual acceleration.  http://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20140013174.pdf  Have a look at what Dr. White is suggesting:  These are the potential voyages of the EMDrive powered IXS Clark solar system explorer:  http://emdrive.wiki/Potential_EMDrive_solar_system_explorer_ship

That is VERY IMPORTANT because many people use the CofE velocity violation Paradox as proof the EMDrive can't work.  Well if the EMDrive can't work because of the CofE velocity violation Paradox then neither can long term ION powered space craft work.

EW going against Shawyers advice to NOT use dielectrics as they reduce Q, reduce thrust & increase losses, used dielectrics in their EMDrives. Result was snowflake eeight class thrust.

In an ideal fantasy world, every scientist and engineer could attempt to replicate every reported phenomenon. In reality time and resources are limited, so you have to decide somehow what is worth an attempt of replication and what isn't. And the credibility of those making the claim goes a long way toward making this decision.  Suppose a regular scientist/engineer is trying to decide whether to attempt replication of this device, as opposed to doing their normal work. How are they supposed to know these claims are any different than the thousands of other claims from garden variety crackpots, when the claims look exactly the same?   If these guys were just saying something like ""look, we observed this thing happening, we have no idea why it happens, please help us by repeating our experiments and comparing the results and possibly finding our error"" (similar to what happened in the FTL neutrino case) they would be much more credible.

That so many of such distinction have, in fact, taken notice (NASA and Boeing aren't exactly chumps, and I I'll bet my skin that Boeing isn't interested for anything but the most capitalistic of reasons), speaks volumes against your argument; to wit, that things have progressed well beyond that stage of choosing.

A tiny, extremely underfunded, group at NASA is doing some work on it. They have so little funding that they can't even get proper equipment for the experiments. That's exactly what I'm talking about. This thing has supposedly been around for 15 years and if it works it would have such enormous implications that if NASA was taking them at all seriously, they would have dedicated a huge amount of time and money into exploring it a long time ago. Instead, all they have is an almost-negligible effort lead by their fringe group.   Have Boeing themselves said anything at all about their on this? Is there any indication that their effort is any more significant than NASA's?   And as a matter of fact, some of those involved have said 'Hey look we have this interesting thing we're trying to figure out', else none of us would be having a look.   The point is there are not saying just that. Everybody pushes their own (different) theory for how it supposedly works and Shawyer's ""theory"" is full of contradictions, incoherent unsubstantiated claims and high-school level mistakes.

Shawyer presented his experimental results to the British gov. They had 7 experts and companies examine his results. All agreed the results were real and his theory worked inside known physics.   Because of that review Shawyer received several 100k pounds to build the Demonstrator EMDrive and test it on a high tech rotary air bearing to simulate doing station keeping on a large comms sat in GEO.  It worked. The results and video showing acceleration are available on the EMDrive web site:  http://emdrive.com/demonstratorengine.html  http://emdrive.com/dynamictests.html  Following that Boeing became interested and after reviewing all the available data, signed a license agreement with SPR, under which the Flight Thruster was developed and tested using a high TRL dual redundant 3.85GHz narrow band Rf generator of Boeings selection.  When that build contract was completed, SPR delivered all the plans ans specs to Boeing.  I have learned Boeing did build a Flight Thruster from the SPR plans but will not discuss it further.

Roger Shawyer told me, Boeing are still a client of SPR and regularly receive updates on the latest SPR research and test unit results. SPR, under their license agreement with Boeing, SPR continually shared with Boeing ALL the SPR IP and technical / engineering data.

That is a strawman when it comes to designing experiments. If he says we're getting meaningless results because we're measuring things wrong, then we need to try measuring things as he describes.  At minimum, this is a requirement in any experiment that seeks to reproduce his results. This is a requirement even if one's primary goal is to debunk him.  For me, proving it works or proving it doesn't are the same thing (collecting evidence); and the ONLY certainty at this point is that collection of evidence does not happen by way of debate."
EmDrive,3aiajn,Zouden,8,Sat Jun 20 16:13:29 2015 UTC,"""This doesn't work because science"" is not science. Science is building, flipping the switch, taking measurements, making adjustments, repeat as needed....not dismissing someone because you don't understand what they are saying.   I'm not dismissing the results of the experiments. I believe that Eagleworks et al have done a good job in their tests and that there is a real effect here. However, Shawyer's claims make no sense. Here's one from his website:   The second generation engines will be capable of producing a specific thrust of 30kN/kW. Thus for 1 kilowatt (typical of the power in a microwave oven) a static thrust of 3 tonnes can be obtained, which is enough to support a large car.   Note however, because the EmDrive obeys the law of conservation of energy, this thrust/power ratio rapidly decreases if the EmDrive is used to accelerate the vehicle along the thrust vector. Whilst the EmDrive can provide lift to counter gravity, (and is therefore not losing kinetic energy), auxiliary propulsion is required to provide the kinetic energy to accelerate the vehicle.   So it can make a car fly but can't make it move forwards. Suddenly the EmDrive is now an antigravity device rather than an actual engine. Yet it works in space?"
EmDrive,3aiajn,TheTravellerEMD,4,Sat Jun 20 14:43:52 2015 UTC,"If you actually research what is behind that claim, you may learn that superconduction very high Q cavities are beasts to deal with and very quickly lose cavity Q due to very slight acceleration. Levitating a mass in the Earths gravity field doesn't require the mass to be accelerated relative to the local inertial reference frame.  So levitation and acceleration are very different actions to an EMDrive.  Shawyer in his latest papers has figured out how to design an all SC EMDrive space plane, not needing any auxilary rocket assistance."
EmDrive,3aiajn,kleinergruenerkaktus,9,Sat Jun 20 16:28:56 2015 UTC,"So it can lift a car but not make it move. And it doesn't require new physics, or provide free energy. Here is a thought experiment.  We take a 3.2 ton weight and hook it to a giant arm that turns a giant generator. Heck, lets say a small 10kw generator and we have some gears to spin it very quickly when the lever slowly comes down. On that weight we also hook up an emdrive and a helium balloon and a battery that can sustain 1kw output for a few minutes.  We turn on the emdrive and the helium balloon lifts the 3.2 ton weight. We turn off the emdrive and 3.2 tons of weight starts turning gears and spinning the 10kw generator. We bleed off just enough to charge the battery and use much of the rest of the 10kw to do whatever we want.  Turn it back on and repeat. Where is the free energy coming from?  EDIT:  ""If you actually research what is behind that claim"" and ""[SPR] has no interest in giving away so much info"" are at odds with each other, and directly counter to science in general."

EmDrive,3aiajn,Taven,0,Sun Jun 21 06:36:37 2015 UTC,"Let's look at your question from the perspective of inside an EMDrive powered ship.  If the EMDrive delivers the same units of kinetic energy increase to the ship, per fixed units of ship time, what will stop the ship continually gaining fixed amounts of kinetic energy every fixed unit of ships time?   Sort of like the Twins Paradox. Before Einstein no one would accept the rate of time flow will be slower for the twin travelling at near light speed. Yet today we accept this is so.  Likewise we are told most galaxies are continually accelerating away from each other, yet there is no new energy in the universe.  It is clear to the crew on the IXS Clark, their reactor is outputting a constant rate of electrical energy and that energy is being converted into microwave energy, then injected into the 20 EMDrive cavities and then converted into increased kinetic energy of the ship as increased velocity. The rate of kinetic energy increase is the same as, minus losses, the electrical energy being generated by their reactor.  If you can find fault with that sequence of events, please let me know.   Of course a fixed observer, not on the ship will claim the ships increasing velocity is growing faster than the ship's generator can supply electrical energy. The ship's captain will shrug his shoulders and say ""Engage""."
EmDrive,3aiajn,Eric1600,6,Sun Jun 21 07:28:03 2015 UTC,"If we assume the drive's power is 100% (or any other %) converted to kinetic energy at a constant rate, the ship will not accelerate in a linear fashion:  ke = mv2 / 2  ke = v2 / 2    set m as 1 for simplicity  0 = 02 / 2       start at rest  1 = v(i)2 / 2    put 1 unit of energy into drive  2 = v(f)2 / 2   put 2nd unit of energy into drive  v(i) = sqrt(2)  v(f) = 2  For constant acceleration, we'd expect v(i) to be 1 if v(f) is 2. Instead, we see that the 2nd unit of energy imparts less velocity than the 1st unit. This begs the question, how does the EMdrive know how fast it's going in order to conserve energy? This is an important physics contradiction that must be rectified if this theory of the EMdrive is to gain any credence."
EmDrive,3aiajn,TheTravellerEMD,3,Sun Jun 21 08:01:24 2015 UTC,"I think you haven't looked at the mathematics involved. As /u/Tbone139 pointed out in another reply, the relationship between KE and velocity is:  ke = mv^2 /2   So that assuming constant mass, if we ""inject"" kinetic energy, velocity will increase as so:  v^2 = 2ke v = sqrt(2ke)   I've charted it for you here. Red is velocity, blue is acceleration.  As you can see, as velocity increases, acceleration decreases. Yet we're still supplying constant power! Why does the EmDrive become less efficient just because the ship is moving faster? How does it ""know"" how fast it's going to begin with?    The ship's captain will shrug his shoulders and say ""Engage"".   Then he'll say ""why aren't we going faster?"""
EmDrive,3aiajn,TheTravellerEMD,0,Sun Jun 21 10:56:05 2015 UTC,"The ship's electrical power supply can only put out a constant unit of energy per unit of time. Subtracting the various conversion losses and cavity eddy current losses, there is a fixed amount of energy to convert to kinetic per fixed unit of time. The only thing that limits acceleration is the fixed capacity of the electrical supply and the fixed amount of Rf energy that can be genearted per fixed unit of time. You can't get more kinetic energy gain per fixed unit of time than the various subsystems can provide.  With your graph, are you assuming somehow the ship's mass knows it velocity relative to a non moving observer?   The reality is the ship's mass has no idea how fast it is going relative to a distant non moving observer. The g force experienced by the crew will not drop off as you seem to believe. Maybe you can explain to me what known physical effect will cause the ship to know now fast it is going and to automatically reduce the ship's acceleration because of accumulated ship velocity."

EmDrive,3aiajn,TheTravellerEMD,4,Sat Jun 20 18:18:00 2015 UTC,"Also I submit that 'EmDrive' is a terrible and misleading name for this device; we need to make something up from the truth, which is more along the lines of 'radio frequency motion amplifier'.   ""Radio Frequency"" = ""Electromagnetic"", as it could potentially work on a larger spectrum.  ""Motion Amplifier"" = ""Drive"", To propel or carry along by force in a specified direction, or steer a force. As we don't know the exact mechanism as of yet, this is specific enough but leaves room for any discovery.   Yes, Electromagnetic Drive fits quite nicely. I propose we call it ""EmDrive"" for short.   Being any more specific at this point in time is not only premature, but naming is very much a process of ""whatever sticks first"" and EmDrive has stuck. And thankfully, because all other names proposed (Q-Drive, Cannae Drive - both tell us nothing and have to be explained every damn time) have been rubbish."
EmDrive,3aiajn,Eric1600,4,Sat Jun 20 23:46:01 2015 UTC,"But first you need to do some system design work!  Something missing from a lot of the amateur builds is a careful analysis of the system before building it.  Look at what you're trying to measure, say you expect 10uN max (Shaywer's high estimate in Force/Power vs NASA's measurements) 0.1uN.  So if 0.1uN is the bottom you'll need to measure down to 0.01uN.  Now you need to design a measurement system with noise that is below 0.01uN before you even try to build a EM drive and test it.  You've got to have a solid working test system first."

EmDrive,3aiajn,LoreChano,3,Sun Jun 21 06:45:31 2015 UTC,"Yes, it seems that the wiki page covers this. The footnote for the Yang's Q values says:   Q calculated from Fig.5 ""frustum microwave cavity actual resonance curve""of ""Net thrust measurement of propellantless microwave thrusters"", 2011, where Frequency Bandwidth=0.0016GHz, Frequency=2.45 GHz, hence Q=2.45/0.0016=1531. This is the value of Q calculated according to the convention in the West. See definition of quality factor Q [11]. Notice that Prof. Yang reports different values in her tables because of her different convention.   Are you disagreeing with the definition of Q? Does Shawyer calculate Q the same way as Yang?"
EmDrive,3aiajn,TheTravellerEMD,-1,Sun Jun 21 06:59:58 2015 UTC,"I'm saying let the Chinese define Q their way, as long as it is consistent.

Please read the papers yourself and don't rely on 2nd hand opinions."
EmDrive,3aiajn,LoreChano,2,Sun Jun 21 07:51:21 2015 UTC,"For experimental designs you have to look at the power:force ratios.  The best is 408 mN/KW and the worst is the nasa tests about 1.1 to 0.28 mN/KW.  So that's about a 1000:1 max/min difference that you should allow when designing the experiment.  You'll also need to see how the Q compares.  Shawyer's was 60k and Nasa was 18k.  So once you sit down and figure out what range of force your theoretical experiment will be able to produce, then you have to design an experiment that can accurately test these ranges.  Then add the device you want to test."

Maybe in this next test setup, EW will listen to Shawyer as the Chinese did.   Paul March in his last posting on NSF did say EW were building a 1.2kW magnetron EMDrive and testing it on a Shawyer like Tweeter Totter balance beam test rig.  They will need to lengthen their existing cavity as it is too short to get resonance at 2.45GHz."

Now they do have to rescale their experiment and look for another model for how the Em Drive might work.  According to Shawyer the Q has a linear relationship with force."
EmDrive,3aiajn,TheTravellerEMD,-1,Sun Jun 21 15:42:10 2015 UTC,"EW did one test with a non dielectric cavity that was based on the Demonstrator engine, minus the constant diameter tail.  When I inputted the 2.168GHz they used, it produced resonance at TM012 which their antenna couldn't excite. So no wonder they found no trust with this one test.  Roger Shawyer told them to NOT use a dielectric as they would have increased losses, lower Q and lower thrust but they ignored him and got 30uN of force or the weight of a snowflake falling on their test rig.  The Chinese listen to Shawyer and got 710mN of force, while Shawyers best was 175mN of force both with NO dielectric.  Roger Shawyer also told me and EW that while COMSOL could be used to aid EMDrive design it's cutoff output needed to be adjusted / corrected or the result may not work."

My calculator was created in cooperation with Roger Shawyer to make building DIY EMDrives easier as Roger Shawyer told me he would like to see hundreds of working EMDrives all over the planet.

They got 30uN of thrust or 0.003g or the weight of a snowflake.  Lets hope they listen to Shawyer when they build their 1.2kW magnetron powered EMDrive."
EmDrive,3acayb,smckenzie23,14,Thu Jun 18 23:03:32 2015 UTC,I think that his theory doing away with dark matter is actually one of the things that makes it less attractive.  Things like gravitational lensing really require dark matter to exist his excess radiation doesn't create the mass needed for these types of properties.Also the flyby and anomalies have been pretty well explained already with excess heat from the radioactive power source.  If anything is theories get in the way of these explanations.
EmDrive,3acayb,Professor226,35,Fri Jun 19 00:36:12 2015 UTC,"OK, into the reddit fray! I have not published a paper on lensing yet, but MiHsC should affect the inertia of light (as it does in the emdrive). MiHsC fixes galaxy rotation by reducing the inertial mass (centrifugal force) of galactic edge stars, so it should bend light there in a similar way. Also, do note that the flyby anomalies have certainly not been explained by thermal models, and although papers have been published explaining the Pioneer anomaly that way, I'd like to point out that, like dark matter, they use complex and adjustable models. I wrote a blog on this here:  http://physicsfromtheedge.blogspot.co.uk/2012/05/comment-on-thermal-model-of-pioneer.html"

Why would any acceleration produce an information horizon? Or does this only happen at relativistic velocities?"
EmDrive,3acayb,_hooo,2,Thu Jun 25 20:55:48 2015 UTC,"You get information horizons for any velocity/acceleration. They occur because if you accelerate, say, to the right, then information far to your left will never catch up (if you continue to accelerate). It can be calculated (in a simplified way) by assuming there's a parcel of information some distance to your left that can only travel at speed c, and you're accelerating to the right. Since v=u+at, and starting from rest so u=0, at time t=c/a you'll be at light speed so everything to your left will be invisible. To calculate the original distance away to the left, of the information that is now just invisible, you can use: dist = vt = c(c/a) = c2 / a. For an acceleration of 9.8 m/s2 this means the horizon is about a light year away (~1016 m). For a horizon at the Hubble distance (~1026 m, where there is one) you get an acceleration close to the cosmic acceleration.."
EmDrive,3acayb,memcculloch,5,Fri Jun 26 09:30:37 2015 UTC,"This is the only instance I can find of McCulloch talking about MIHSC with regard to gravitational lensing: http://physicsfromtheedge.blogspot.com/2015/03/dark-matter-contradicts-itself.html   In contrast, MiHsC says that there is no dark matter (see my blog here and my paper here) and that the light is bending because its inertial mass varies due to the variation in acceleration within the cluster.   I don't pretend to understand how MIHSC would account for gravitational lensing but this is McCulloch's explanation. I'd be very interested to see an expanded answer."

EmDrive,3acayb,bbasara007,7,Fri Jun 19 02:45:54 2015 UTC,"Yes. But dark matter has mass. What we find is that the amount of lensing around galaxies is too high for the amount of matter they contain, and when we add dark matter into the equation, our results are consistent with other results predicting this mass such as the spin velocity of those galxies. So realistically, it has to be some form of matter or some unknown substance that exerts gravitational force but does not have mass. We have  no models of such a substance."
EmDrive,3acayb,Martel_the_Hammer,9,Fri Jun 19 04:32:25 2015 UTC,"So if MiHsC pans out exactly as /u/memcculloch describes, can we derive actual force predictions as he does here. Seems like it matches pretty well.   Is there any way to figure maximum thrust predictions for a perfectly tuned, perfectly resonating, device? Shawyer's 30kN/kW seems so crazy."
EmDrive,3acayb,PolygonMan,9,Fri Jun 19 20:58:30 2015 UTC,Are there any theoretical improvements that could be made to the emDrive based on the assumption that MiHsC is correct? If you were to go from the theory -> to the practical application would it look the same as what was randomly stumbled upon by Shawyer?
EmDrive,3acayb,memcculloch,2,Fri Jun 19 17:05:46 2015 UTC,Good question. MiHsC predicts:   It's necessary to tune the big end's width so it's similar to or slighty larger than length (l) so the Unruh waves formed by photons bouncing end-end fit exactly at the wide end. Carefully adjusting the small end width so wave fit better there than at the big end could lead to a reverse thrust mode. Higher P and Q increase thrust (no surprise). Reducing c might enhance the effect (dielectric) but the cavity would need resizing. More generally: it should be possible to make horizons using metamaterials (other metal structures) and make things move that way.
EmDrive,3acayb,Zouden,4,Tue Jun 23 20:27:55 2015 UTC,"If I understand the basics of Modified inertia by a Hubble-scale Casimir effect (MiHsC), the idea is that inertia is created by Unruh radiation waves that propagate from the very edge of what is possible to see. So first, inertia is not some set in stone constant like the speed of light. For mass with very low acceleration, inertia is less.  But the relevant idea for this subreddit is how his ideas predict force out of the emdrive. In his model, Unruh waves must fit in the frame. His idea is that, since more waves would fit in the bigger end, the ones that wouldn't would not exist for the small end (because we could infer information about something beyond the Rindler horizon, which is not possible). So photons at that end of the frustum have more inertial mass that at the small end. So as we flood the cavity with photons, as their inertia changes between the large and small end it transfers momentum to the device.  So if this is happening, why do we need a high Q factor? Shouldn't any photons work? Does the resonating somehow make the frustum opaque to the Unruh waves?"
EmDrive,3acayb,YugoReventlov,2,Thu Jun 18 23:25:52 2015 UTC,"My understanding is that the high Q factor means you get more bounces, and thus more acceleration, for each photon that you put in."
EmDrive,3acayb,ItsAConspiracy,3,Fri Jun 19 06:59:30 2015 UTC,"Is this idea related to the Woodward drive at all, or am I misunderstanding?"
EmDrive,3acayb,Zouden,4,Fri Jun 19 11:27:15 2015 UTC,"Different idea, along similar lines. Woodward's idea is that inertia is caused by interaction with all the distant matter in the universe (which was Mach's idea). He says there's a term in relativity that appears only when energy is changing, which is normally ignored, and changes mass in proportion to the rate of energy change.  So he has a capacitor that he rapidly charges and discharges while he vibrates it back and forth, timed so it will have more mass in one direction than the other. He's claiming statistically significant results, but it's hard to measure small forces on things that are vibrating that much.  So they seem to have different explanations of inertia which aren't really compatible, but they both say inertia is caused by interactions with distant things in the universe, and both ideas involve something moving rapidly back and forth with more inertia in one direction."
EmDrive,3acayb,flux_capacitor78,2,Fri Jun 19 11:58:36 2015 UTC,I wonder if a future theory will unite those ideas and we'll see that they were both right.
EmDrive,3acayb,memcculloch,2,Fri Jun 19 13:08:25 2015 UTC,"Woodward states inertia is completely explained as a gravitational effect in general relativity, through Mach's principle, as told by Einstein and Wheeler. It does not need quantum mechanics and quantum fields like Unruh radiation. McCulloch's MiHsC on the contrary is a ZPF (Zero Point Field) theory."
EmDrive,3acayb,god_uses_a_mac,3,Thu Jul 2 22:25:55 2015 UTC,"I can't wait to get the book. I just stumbled across this post about quasar jets and how MiHsC predicts this as well as the flyby anomalies and some large scale structures in the Universe. Holy crap, the more I read the more I'm blown away.  /u/memcculloch, if you are still around, I'm just very curious about what clicked and made you think inertia is controlled by Unruh radiation and the Rindler horizon. I see your background is geomatics, so you are used to thinking spatially. And you are at a School of marine science, so you must think of waves and bodies of water some. But was there something that tipped you off that inertia could be an effect of the whole system and changing boundries? What was the moment when it clicked?  If this is in the book, feel free to tell me to buy the frickin' book."
EmDrive,3acayb,memcculloch,11,Fri Jun 19 22:34:02 2015 UTC,"There have been many moments, but one of the first occurred visiting S.Korea in 2004. I saw swastika signs by the road (symbol for a Buddhist temple I hasten to add!). With my background in ocean physics (inc. waves) I realised that the arms would disallow waves (a seiche) & so make the wave field non-uniform causing it to rotate. Later I read inspiring papers by Haisch, Rueda & Puthoff on zpf inertia and Milgrom on MoND, and realised that I could fix the flaws in both with a cosmic seiche, which became MiHsC."

That seems like something highly non-local type of logic, which is a very bad thing. If it was local, the change of inertia should propagate from the apparent horizon to the accelerating body at the speed of light, something I didn't see any mention of.   Also, what /u/Professor226 pointed out is very true: this is a MOND type theory in how it tries to explain away dark matter. That is not at all attractive, since no matter what McCulloch tries to claim, there is ample evidence for dark matter and against any type of MOND theory; see the Bullet cluster for the prime example of this."

Notice how they are placing them in the outside?, as if they were conventional rockets, maybe meant to be disposed as dead weight at some point?  Not really necessary. These thrusters will be as effective at the start as in the end of a mission, and the ships will become 100% reusable, only requiring a refill of supplies and other consumables.   In the future, the Emdrives could be placed completely within the ship's hull, making it easier to service them while on a mission.

This shows the drive is still in testing and that the thrust hasn't been outright disproved since we last heard from them. They wouldn't be using a disproved, falsified engine in these renderings if that were the case.

Assuming we had a lot of time to iterate and make the EM Drive more efficient would it be possible to have enough thrust from a drive around that size? Or would it be off by some order of magnitude?
EmDrive,3aalj9,nspectre,9,Thu Jun 18 18:23:01 2015 UTC,"1g acceleration is the holy grail of spacecraft engine design. If the EMDrive can produce enough thrust to lift itself, and hover, then we are onto something. But no one has shown that thrust scales with Q factor, or demonstrated the elusive high-Q superconducting version."

We could easily put up energy shields and mount lasers that automatically target any kind of micrometeorite.  If you don't believe me on the energy shields take a look at this link: http://www.cnet.com/news/boeing-patents-star-wars-style-force-fields/.

It's something like $10 per cm3 or so.  I'd be extremely surprised, if for something the shape/size of the frustum, someone couldn't get it much more cheaply manufactured by going to a machining/cnc shop (keywords: ""milling service"" or ""cnc service"") and saying to them ""do me this shape"".

Since I stumbled on MiHsC I'm kinda freaking out a little bit. It is a small chance... But if this turns out to be true it will be at least as big as Special Relativity.

EmDrive,3a8g1o,IDoNotAgreeWithYou,1 point,Thu Jun 18 06:56:52 2015 UTC,"So much misinformation here. There is no free energy, it requires a power source, it does not exert more energy than is put into it. It seems to violate Newton's 3rd law, yes. However, imagine if I was to throw a ball, it would exert the same force back onto me, correct? Maybe this device takes that throwing energy but the return energy is converted to heat somehow instead of physical force, so the ball wouldn't end up pushing back. This is not a violation of newtons 3rd law, energy is not created nor destroyed, it is simply converted."
EmDrive,3a8g1o,smckenzie23,3,Thu Jun 18 08:05:51 2015 UTC,"Of course it puts more energy out than you put in, at least according to Shawer. Right on his web site Shawer states:   This would lead to a static specific thrust of 3.15 x 104 N/kW (3.2 tonnes / kW)   3.2 tonnes per KW? Are you shitting me? So I can get a 5KW Honda generator and lift a 16 tonne load? OK, with that much force how about I easily turn 30KW generator and keep 25KW for myself? Somehow he claims this doesn't violate conservation of energy, and he does so without invoking zero point energy from the vacuum or anything like that.   So yes, unless there is a limit to thrust based on input below a certain threshold (which doesn't match Shawer's crackpot ideas) or somehow a limit on maximum speed, it totally violate both conservation of energy and conservation of momentum. This is why nobody has paid much attention to Shawyer for a decade. Any high school physics student can look at what he is saying and and decide he is full of shit in about 10 min.  Even if he is getting thrust, everyone who looks at his reasons instantly thinks it must be an error. It is like someone with a rash saying they got it from an alien abduction: sure, they have a rash, but are you going to spend any time trying to figure out why?  Now MiHsC. Holy crap if that is true...  totally different ball game. Free energy and perpetual motion is totally possible. This is much bigger than a thruster. This is an evolutionary leap for humanity. Not just in the things we will get out of it (free energy, flying cars, trivial space travel in our solar system, deep space probes to distant stars in mere decades), it is a leap in our understanding of the Universe every bit as powerful as special relativity. It means that not only are matter and energy representations of the same thing (E=MC2) but information is a 3rd component. We can literally pull energy out of the system by causing changes in inertia through manipulating our information about the Rindler Horizon!  It is a very small chance that it is true. If it is, the emdrive is just the tip of the iceberg."

EmDrive,3a8g1o,Zouden,1 point,Thu Jun 18 09:40:19 2015 UTC,"By reactionless I mean it uses no propellant; nothing is lost from the machine, so it can keep accelerating indefinitely as long as it has electricity.

Maybe the radiation is pushing off of something the way a rocket generates more power on earth than in space because it has the air to push off of."
EmDrive,3a8g1o,ItsAConspiracy,1 point,Fri Jun 19 14:40:33 2015 UTC,"When the vase leaves my hand it has a certain momentum. Me and the capsule (I am strapped in the capsule) will obtain an equal momentum in the opposite direction, right? So while the vase is still flying within the capsule, the velocity of the capsule will be different than before due to conservation of momentum, correct? When the vase smashes on the wall part of its initial kinetic energy is converted into heat (consider also plastic deformation) and won't be transferred back to the capsule as kinetic energy. So the impact will decrease but not cancel completely the momentum of the capsule acquired by the throw. Can someone explain please where the flaw in this logic is?"
EmDrive,3a3rce,goocy,15,Wed Jun 17 00:16:28 2015 UTC,"Sure I can come up with a cheap and dirty trick to dampen vibrations. Got patents on a antivibration platform.  Cheap way to dampen vibrations. Get a 10 cm thick or thicker piece of foam (something that will absorb water and have as close to a sponge cell spacing as you can, right around 60 cm x 60 cm or larger if needed.  Get a tub that the foam can sit into barely touching the walls of the tub (trim if needed). Make 8 squares of foam about 10 cm each to put under each corner. 4 under each corner on the bottom of the tub and 4 inside next to the side walls between the corners. Now you have a tub with foam inside of it supported by 8 squares of foam.  Fill the tub with water so the foam is just a little soggy and the water is about 1/2 way up the inside if the tub. It will depend on the foam as to how it absorbs water.  Take a piece of plywood that can sit on the center of the foam on top, not touching the sides of the tub. Put your device on the plywood.   Cheap way to dampen vibrations and if your good you can add or take out water to tune it."

EmDrive,3a3rce,TortugaTerritory,3,Wed Jun 17 01:50:50 2015 UTC,Awesome thanks for posting this. Very interesting to hear why they gave up on the levitation platform.  I don't think he's going to be able to fix the current setup without access to a seismically isolated lab. But maybe we can come up with a new design for them.
EmDrive,3a3rce,bitofaknowitall,2,Wed Jun 17 01:46:28 2015 UTC,Did you tell him about making more repetitions of a single test and making null tests? what was his view on that?
EmDrive,3a3rce,jpcoffey,4,Wed Jun 17 08:45:40 2015 UTC,"Yup, I introduced him to the most basic experimental paradigms - the experimental/control paradigm and the longitudinal paradigm (which he's essentially running right now).  With his current setup, even I'm not really sure how to introduce a control device. We've talked about installing a dummy next to the running device, but he's not even confident to get the weight distributed correctly, let alone match the exact inertia. And because his current ""noise"" is largely chaotic motion from random environmental influences, the dummy would move completely different from the main device unless its weight distribution is perfectly identical.  So I suggested a few tricks to make the current longitudinal design more robust: of course, lower the environmental noise. But running it for longer periods of time, and randomizing the duty cycle should also help. Plus, I suggested measuring confounding variables like the cavity temperature, so we can confirm or deny the ""hot air"" hypothesis."
EmDrive,3a3rce,Eric1600,4,Wed Jun 17 12:49:39 2015 UTC,"Even Nasa and Shawyer had to rely on a null test because their systems were too noisy and they are measuring forces that are about  95uN vs this setup which could only hope to produce about 60nN to 10nN.  This tiny force seems impossible to measure with this setup as there are way too many random thermal, vibrational and lorenz forces that would overwhelm the expected measured force."

EmDrive,3a3mmt,bitofaknowitall,5,Wed Jun 17 00:11:22 2015 UTC,"Here's why they abandoned the first set up:   Q: Why did you give up the levitating EMdrive? It seemed promising, with frictionless mounting and all. A: The levitation device is overwhelmed with the weight. It's just a toy that normally supports a spinning globe, and we put about 20g more into it than originally. The principle is quite solid - it uses a Hall sensor to detect the current position of the magnet, not one of these dumb light switches. The main feedback loop works at 40kHz; that should be quick enough. But in our setup, the whole thing wobbled up and down constantly - it's impossible to get the weight distributed correctly. By the way, that's the reason for the strong fall-off at the end of the graphs: the device is always a bit lopsided, and when it rotates slow enough, it ""falls"" into a stable orientation and doesn't have enough momentum to start another rotation. Remember, this thing only turns once every ten seconds or so.  Q: That's a shame. Have you considered upgrading the levitation stand? A: All the time. I already upgraded the MOSFET and the primary coil, and a decent control mechanism should be able to correct for lopsided weight. I'm also pretty sure that there's some bug in the feedback loop - every once in a while, the levitating load just shudders for a second, without reason. That shouldn't be happening. Unfortunately, the main control chip is just a die under a blob of epoxy - I don't even know exactly what it is, and modifying the firmware is out of the question. My best bet would probably be to build a levitation stand from scratch, with proper analog feedback and a control scheme that takes one or more derivatives of motion into account. But I have a wife and a life, and this plan would take quite a lot of time and effort. So, for now it's on the backburner, in case that nothing else works.   Thanks to /u/goocy for the interview here."
EmDrive,3a3mmt,lmbfan,9,Wed Jun 17 02:52:51 2015 UTC,"http://i.imgur.com/6ghdDjO.jpg  Test protocol:  Equipment is the same as the other Baby EM drive equipment plus the following (see diagram): Vibration isolation table, micro-Newton scale, hinged counterweight + lever arm (aluminum I-beam perhaps), plexiglass enclosure (or similar, even cardboard would work to a certain extent, vacuum chamber would be ideal but probably impractical for DIY testers).  Possibly obtain a dummy load in the form of a regular cylindrical resonating chamber for the control test.  Edit: A cheap vibration table has been suggested in this thread by /u/See-Shell below.  An additional complete setup with a dummy load has been suggested by /u/goocy below.  The dummy and live setups would be side by side in the enclosure with identical on-off cycle.  They also suggested adding at a minimum a hall effect and temperature sensors with an Adruino/Raspberry Pi recording/control device.  In addition, in this post, WarpTech recommends a Gauss sensor or magnets to be hung near the cavity to detect any DC magnetic fields that may be escaping.  3 tests with multiple repetitions.  All tests are the same, except the test article on the end: EM drive up, EM drive down, and dummy load (resonating cylinder or out-of-frequency/non-resonating EM drive).   Set up enclosure with test equipment. Wait a suitable time for turbulence to subside (30 min perhaps). Zero out scale remotely (otherwise, zero out before step 2). Start weight recording for x minutes unpowered for baseline (10 min? 1 hour?). Power on EM drive for x minutes. Cut power for x minutes to re-stabilize. Repeat 5 & 6 for y cycles (at least 10).   /u/goocy also suggests a random on-off cycle with a random lengths to eliminate or reduce periodic/cyclical effects.  The dummy load test is crucial to help identify uncontrolled thermal and magnetic effects.    Lever arm should be long enough to multiply the force of the EM drive to detectable levels.  The vibration table should be of sturdy construction with some sort of dampening at the interface between the table and the floor, possibly sand buckets.  Ideally, the scale would have a computer interface and/or memory device to record dynamic variations in force.  The recording device (likely a computer, unless one is built in to the scale) should be outside the enclosure and not resting on the vibration table to eliminate random events such as hard drive platter vibrations and thermal effects (possibly wireless, but this introduces extra EM noise, wired may be better - trade off between EM and the connecting cable introducing vibrations from the computer).  The power and control module should be on the hinged end of the I-beam but should not be placed on the table directly (to rule out wire stiffness issues).  The power and control module should be self contained and remote controlled (as the other tests were).  All devices should be firmly and securely fastened with no slippage.  Edit: forgot about the pivot.  Ideally steel or other hard material, centered on the scale, with a small radius or sharp ridge in contact with the I beam. Distance from center of hinge to pivot contact point, and center of hinge to center of EM drive cylinder axis should be measured as precisely as possible to calculate actual force.  Edit 2: added suggestions from this thread.  Edit 3: added DC magnetic field detectors & links."

Use random duty cycles to break any coincidental correlation with the environment.   Good suggestion, possibly both regular and random cycles could be tested.

EmDrive,3a3mmt,goocy,2,Wed Jun 17 18:40:42 2015 UTC,"Duplicate setups (two arms with scales) next to each other on the same dampening platform would be ideal. Imagine that the cavity creates a hot air updraft, which lifts a bit of weight off the scale. Then the dummy arm would get some of the draft as well, showing the same effect. Or when some external influences causes fluctuations, both arms will be affected equally, and you know with certainty that it came from outside.  And the choice for a microcontroller is usually determined what's currently available - they're versatile enough to be used nearly interchangably. If there isn't anything available yet, I'd recommend a cheap Arduino with an external memory card. It has a plethora of built-in input pins, and is much easier to handle."

EmDrive,3a3mmt,lmbfan,2,Wed Jun 17 17:38:55 2015 UTC,"The lever arm is to amplify the thrust signal and varies based on how long the arm is and where the pivot is placed.  A uN resolution could be amplified almost 20 times by a 1 meter long arm with the pivot placed 5 cm from the hinge.  As the length of the ar9m increases, the feasibility decreases, as the enclosure and table must also increase in size.  2 or 3 meters is probably the practical limit, so 40 to 60 times the force, which gets us near the nN range.  Hopefully /u/bitofaknowitall is correct and we are talking uNs of force, and the lever arm serves in this case to amplify the signal from the noise.  An alternative to the lever arm + scale would be the arm + a spring.  Attach a laser pointer to the end and bounce it off a couple of mirrors.  Measure the dot displacement.  The mirrors should be mounted to the same vibration table to reduce the noise.  The spring stiffness would also dictate whether or not the control assembly could be mounted to the lever arm.  Directly measuring force is not as straightforward in this setup."
EmDrive,3a3mmt,Eric1600,3,Wed Jun 17 18:32:50 2015 UTC,Unfortunately mechanical amplification doesn't change the fact that the source of the force is so tiny and easily influenced by external factors.

The most likely outcome is therefore measurement error. If this is not the case the fundamental law of mechanics is flawed (F=dp/dt). Some theories try to fix this by different means. One example is redefining inertia, another would be supplying the energy from external sources. The problem here is that we do call it the fundamental law of mechanics for a reason. General relativity as well as everything we know depend on it. Which would therefore result in infinite energy (if the thrust isn't transient)."

As other posts clarify, energy is defined by the product of force (or in the terminolgy you're using, thrust) and distance. If you divide that by time, you get power, or the product of thrust by speed.  Now, the whole point is that speed is relative. Measurements by two  independent observers that are not accelerating must agree. The first law of thermodinamics must happen no matter how fast the one making the measurements is moving relative to the EmDrive powered device. Unless momentum is conserved two observes will disagree on how much energy a moving body acquires.  To quote myself from another post: Say you have a 1000 kg gun in space, initially resting stationary to you, that shoots a 1 kg shell at 1000 m/s. The gun itself is now moving in the opposite direction of the shell at 1 m/s to conserve momentum.  A observer that was stationary will see the gun now with a energy of 500 joules, and the shell with an energy of 500000 joules so the total energy converted from chemical energy into kinetic is 500500 J.  Now consider a new observer who was previously traveling towards the rear of the gun when it fires at 1000 m/s. When the gun fires, now he sees the shell as stationary, and the gun is cruising at 1001 m/s. According to this observer the system's previous kinetic energy was ½ * 1001 * 10002 J, which adds to 500500000 J, and now is 1/2* 1000 * 10012 which adds to 501000500. The difference between both is again 500500 J so both obsevers agree on how much energy was converted from chemical into kinetic.  The same way, if the now moving gun fires again, you can calculate how energy is conserved and is consistent again for both observers.  Consider now a 1000 kg ship with a truly reactionless drive, again floating in space. It's pilot sees it creating a force of 100 newtons for 10 seconds, and doing so spends 1000 joules of energy on electricity powering the device. By doing so the ship is accelerated at 0.1 m/s2 to a final speed relative to it's final position of 1 m/s. It's kinetic energy is now relative to an observer initially at rest with it of 500 joules, so this drive seems to be 50% energy efficient and seemingly creates no problems.  But what happens with an observer who was moving towards the ship at 1000 m/s? He saw the ship initially with a kinetic energy of ½ * 1000 * 10002 = 500000000 J, and now with an energy of 1/2* 1000* 10012 = 501000500, gaining 1000500 J of kinetic energy and creating 999500 J out of nothing.  And the same thing will eventually happen to the stationary observer, as you noted on the OP; sooner or later he'll see the craft creating energy when it has accelerated enough. Indeed, he can attach the engine to a wheel, and once the wheel moves fast enough it'll create enough energy to power itself. Beyond that, andit'll produce a surplus of free energy.  There's however one reactionless engine that can't create energy. If (rounding up) the engine produces no more than 1 Newton of force for 300 megawatts of power, then in order to create enegy it has to travel faster than light. It turns out, there's an engine with that efficiency: a photon rocket."
EmDrive,3a45jh,Rowenstin,2,Wed Jun 17 15:00:27 2015 UTC,"Even a photon rocket consumes some mass (unless supplied from an external source, like solar panels). After all, the energy to power the rocket has some mass also (even if very little, as in chemical energy used in batteries)."

EmDrive,3a0zzb,DrBagelBites,12,Tue Jun 16 14:54:40 2015 UTC,The data logging shouldn’t start with the EMDrive being turned on. It should start with a period of 5+ minutes in idle state (The baby-EMDrive turned off) so we can observe the noise level of the environment before any of the experiments start.
EmDrive,3a0zzb,oval999,12,Tue Jun 16 12:23:44 2015 UTC,Wouldn't 5 minutes be too short? The test took place over 8 hours. I would think at least an hour of observed noise level would be preferable.

I hope the Hackaday team takes feedback from the community on the need for base-line runs with the device off as well as other ways to improve their set up and experimental design.  If they don't take some good faith advice from the community, all their hard work will do little good. I'm afraid ambiguous results from flawed experimental designs will have an overall negative effect. It will mean better equipped and experienced labs will continue to pass on attempting to replicate EmDrive claims, dismissing such claims as experimental error and ""hot air"" (in a literal sense too!).  So, please Hackaday folks, take the feedback seriously, and try to improve on the design and data collection."

EmDrive,3a0zzb,goocy,3,Wed Jun 17 04:23:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah.  I've mostly followed the Nasa testing closely, but Shawyer reports the same issue.  Nasa just subtracted it from the measurement when the Em Drive was on to determine the 'net force' of the engine.  The test setup has spinning hard drives and extra Lorenz forces from EM leakage.   We're talking of net thrust because of course the setup was also tested with a null 50 ohm load connected, in order to cancel the effect from the drives and detect any detect any spurious force due to EM coupling with the whole apparatus (which exists, at 9.6 µN) and this ""null"" spurious force was evidently subtracted from any thrust signal due to the drives then tested on the pendulum. http://nextbigfuture.com/2015/02/more-emdrive-experiment-information.html   It's about 10% of the measured values, but it also doesn't give much confidence in the quality of the measurements especially when a 180 degree rotation shows a 2x difference in force."
EmDrive,3a0zzb,BlaineMiller,6,Wed Jun 17 16:20:25 2015 UTC,"I've run a quick statistical analysis on the raw data.  First analysis  I've started with the assumption that the EMdrive's thrust reaches equilibrium with the counterforce of the torsion thread instantly. If this assumption holds, we should see a difference in average absolute rotation between powered on and powered off phases.  For this analysis, I've truncated the first 30 minutes of data and segmented the next 7:45 hours into 8 segments - 4 with power on, 4 with power off. I've then calculated the mean absolute rotation for each segment.  These are the intermediate results:  Set 1: 272.508 276.845 281.028 284.917 Set 2: 277.934 276,254 279,188 284,699   I've then run a pairwise, 2-tailed Student's T-test over this data.  This test says that there is a 83% chance that the two sets of values are not different from each other. So, there is no difference in absolute rotation.  Second analysis  So maybe my assumption is wrong and the torsion thread is too weak to reach equilibrium even after an hour of opposing forces. So I assume the counterforce to be small and constant - like dynamic friction from a ball bearing, for example. In this case, the slope becomes the most relevant indicator of choice: it represents the rotational speed, and indicates if there is thrust or not.  I fit a linear slope into all 8 data segments with Matlab's polyfit(). These are the results:  Set 1: 0,034667 -0,068421 -0,072728 -0,089555 Set 2: 0,027452 0,084532 0,048165 0,141407   If I assume that two subsequent segments are comparable with each other, I can run the same T-test as before. It now says that there is only a 1.6% chance that the two sets of slopes come from the same random distribution. This is fairly strong evidence that the slopes actually are different.  Discussion  We have two conflicting arguments, and the resolution comes down to the mechanics of the thread. Is it weak, is it strong? Are there other confounding variables? We need either very accurate torque measurements or much lower noise levels to find out, and changing the diameter of the thread would also shed more light onto this data.  Yes, I should be writing my dissertation. But this is more fun."
EmDrive,3a0zzb,krestenks,3,Wed Jun 17 01:28:05 2015 UTC,"Wow excellent thinking!.  After reading through both analysis, it seems like the experiments can be improved with little effort.  And it clears up any bias anyone might have just by looking at the raw data.  Thank you."

EmDrive,3a0zzb,BlaineMiller,2,Wed Jun 17 12:56:14 2015 UTC,I think you should use both China's experiment and Nasa's as a max/min for expectations.  If you use Nasa's then it's even more impossible for them to measure at these low levels.
EmDrive,3a0zzb,raresaturn,1 point,Wed Jun 17 16:38:03 2015 UTC,Very interesting.  It looks like the very first bump of the EM drive gave you a tremendous amount of boost which looks good.  Is the torsion setup still having issues with sway?  It looks like the bar never really reset itself.

[edit] As /u/Rowenstin puts forth below:   Green's scenario could be even more compelling if the shuttle was actually filled with air. Since none of the gas will hit the wall as it'll collide with the molecules in the air, one could think there won't be any momentum to cancel the astronaut's, but actually all the air within will ""get"" it and increase pressure on the opposite wall by the required amount."
EmDrive,39ww36,Zouden,2,Mon Jun 15 19:50:05 2015 UTC,"Yes exactly, the gas particles will travel forwards until they hit the far wall and impart a momentum change which opposes that from the astronaut.

It's a good read. Me? I think this is the right answer. With the doors closed on the Shuttle it becomes a closed system and even though it might oscillate back and forth as the astronaut and the exhaust from the MMU bounce around inside the cargo bay moving and oscillating the shuttle a little, no real directional movement will be seen. For every action there is a opposite and equal reaction whether it's a gas or a man in a spacesuit. This is the simple reason why the EMDrive is so weird as it seems to violate that very basic law of physics."
EmDrive,39ww36,Rowenstin,0,Mon Jun 15 15:08:00 2015 UTC,Does it matter that the astronaut moves against only one wall while his exhaust might spread out and impact against all the walls of the shuttle?  It seems to me this is an equal (in size) reaction but not necessarily opposite (in direction).
EmDrive,39ww36,See-Shell,7,Mon Jun 15 15:46:17 2015 UTC,"No, the momentum of the gas itself doesn't change because of random bounces. You can even add energy to it and won't make a difference.   To ilustrate what I mean, imagine this. It's a 100 kg astronaut pitcher throwing a 2 kg ball at 10 m/s against the opposite wall. This ball is special, is made of two halves weighting 1 Kg with a spring between them.  Case 1: the ball remains joined until it hits the wall. The astronaut hits one wall with a speed of -0.2 m/s and a momentum of -20 kgm/s and the ball does the same with the opposite wall, with a momentum of 20 kgm/s. This is as expected.  Case 2: the spring is released midflight and the ball divides in two. One of the halves is propelled towards the astronaut, relative to the frame of the moving ball, at a speed of -5 m/s, while the other half therefore acquires another 5 m/s (because now the ball its a closed system and conserves momentum)  Now the speeds are as follows: astronaut -0.2 m/s, half a ball at +5 m/s and half a ball at +15 m/s. The astronauts momentum is, again, -20 kgm/s, and the half balls of +5 kgm/s and +15 kgm/s for a total of +20 kgm/s, again exactly cancelling the astronaut's and conserving it, even when we added 25 joules of kinetic energy from the spring. The gas scenario involves many many more moving balls colliding with each other, but in the end it doesn't make a difference.  Green's scenario could be even more compelling if the shuttle was actually filled with air. Since none of the gas will hit the wall as it'll collide with themolecues in the air, one could think there won't be any momentum to cancel the astronaut's, but actually all the air within will ""get"" it and increase pressure on the opposite wall by the required amount."
EmDrive,39ww36,See-Shell,2,Mon Jun 15 17:35:19 2015 UTC,"No sorry, just because the thrust would be at right angles it would impart momentum just at a different angle."
EmDrive,39ww36,LoreChano,2,Mon Jun 15 17:50:24 2015 UTC,"No. Consider this. You're trapped in a high pressure tank and you have a fire extinguisher that your going to shoot in one direction. Stand there and shoot away, the gas imparts momentum to you down to your feet and in turn the gas pushes against the farther walls even though it's dispersed over a wider area.  The EMDrive OTOH could be thought of like this, you run up the side of the tank changing the local enclosed gravity profile of the tank and then you can move it in the direction you are running. And you haven't violated any laws."
EmDrive,39ww36,Motolization,6,Tue Jun 16 14:13:35 2015 UTC,"I think discussing Emdrive terminal velocity is a waste of time. This is impossible, speed is relative, no matter what theory you have. We have to find another explanation."

Do this 2 or 3 times to get a consistent idea of the noice and the behavior of the graph in the null test. Do the same with the Emdrive ON all 10 minutes. The switching on and off is messy and makes it difficult to see if there is trust or not. Do this 3 or 5 times, to guarantee that the behavior is the same.

I would also like to note that it is possible to speed things up, if instead of trying to move the planet directly you move a small mass and use that smaller mass and a variety of maths and slingshotting trickery, to transfer momentum from other planets, ie, Jupiter.   It is the methodology quickly explained in this article: http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/1154784.stm  All this can sort of be done with conventional means as well, but an EMdrive, especially one just powered by the sun, would make things MUCH quicker. It also takes care of problems, like, say, Venus surface being composed of hot & acid, but if you build the EmDrives on asteroids instead, then you can use those to move 'er, outwards.  You might even be able to do shenanigans, like move asteroids, in order to move bigger asteroids, to move ceres, to move venus and this sort of thing, but whomever is doing that better be good at maths least the system becomes billiards.

In this case the one probably everyone has in mind being, I guess, Jupiter.  So essentially, in order to increase Venus's orbital radius, you'd be decreasing Jupiter's.  Step 1: Take 100km+ asteroid from extremely elliptical orbit   (kuiper belt or so) and change its orbit. This is the part the EMdrive helps with, vs the Orion drive, or nuclear powered mass driver you'd actually need otherwise.   Step 2: Asteroid gravitationally slingshots around Venus, losing some a lot of it's speed but increasing Venus's one by a tiny bit. (a slow-down slingshot, not a speedy-up)  Step 3: Slingshot it around Jupiter now (speedy-up slingshot, not slow down), increasing its speed, but reducing Jupiter's.   Step 5: Voila. Technically, you have now transferred energy/momentum/orbital velocity from one planet to the other, using the asteroid's speed as a sort of battery."

It could definitely move a planet but it will still take a ridiculous amount of energy to do so.  It would be interesting however to make a bunch of probes utilizing it to move asteroids/comets/moons in the solar system - if we consolidated a bunch of small bodies we could build a second Earth.

As far as what those measures would be, I'm not sure, unless it would be some type of reverse Dyson sphere that created the energy necessary to sustain the Earth. However, that is way out of our scope at the present. An interesting note, with enough rockets (or one huge one) you could move a planet without the em drive.

An of course, ships will be able to reach stars like Alpha Centauri in some years. And I think this is just a scratch in the realm of the possibilities.  In case 1, it will still be a revolution.

Nevertheless I see 3 possibilities:   This is an experimental error. This seems increasingly unlikely by the day and as more evidence in favor piles up. These devices provide constant acceleration per constant energy expenditure. Which results in apparent violations of conservation of momentum and CoE, probably due to this being a novel way to tap into an existing cosmic energy source. This is the option most people think about when they're talking about interstellar Emdrive missions, and what most people believing in the Emdrive, currently believe.  The devices have a speed limit due to them working wrt a field or a preferred reference frame (also a heresy in modern physics), which means we may not be able to extract energy from them, but we could still use them for floating vehicles and maybe for launching ships to space and for traveling through the Solar System.   The first option is trivial in its outcome (nothing comes out of it) , the second option is damn scary, because relativistic planet crackers become trivially easy to build.   The third option would be uncomfortable for physics and philosophy, but it's way less scary than the second one.   With the second option, we could have perpetual energy and abundance, live a scifi dream and go to the stars, but also any lunatic could launch a ship, make it travel for a year and then make it turn back, returning to Earth at 99% the speed of light, destroying the planet.

At one kw/kg we only need 10 newtons/kilowatt for a flying car.   At this efficiency the speed to generate excess energy is 200m/s, so we can easily get all the energy we need from a flywheel with tangential emdrives spinning it. A 10-meter flywheel at several rpm would do it, making all other energy sources obsolete.  The flywheel could power its own edge thrusters, with additional thrusters for movement. Streamline for operation in atmosphere, and you have a nice saucer shape. See, this could explain a lot.  Bigger versions could float entire cities.  Your own personal flying car might have a flywheel or just batteries. You need 1g to fly, and at 1g you can get to the Moon in four hours, if your car is airtight. Mars in 2 to 5 days, anywhere in the solar system within a couple weeks, and Alpha Centauri in about five years, though of course for that you'd need a much bigger craft with provisions and shielding.  We could migrate off-planet very cheaply and quickly. And we'd better, because anyone could send their saucer out into space for a year or so, then turn it around and after a year of acceleration, slam it into the planet at 99% lightspeed. At just 94% lightspeed the impact will produce as much energy as converting the missile's entire mass to energy...much bigger than any nuclear explosion ever detonated.  Sun-orbiting colonies in constant unpredictable motion will be the way to live. They could be continent-size, supporting massive ecosystems, because more emdrives could relieve mechanical stress.

First off you get lighter satellites and probes because they don't have to carry fuel, which is very good for exploration. If we want to go to Mars we will need much better communication than what we have today.  But I think the most interesting thing of all would be the speed which can be reached using this. If it's a significant fraction of the speed of light it means we can start thinking realistically about sending probes to other solar systems."
EmDrive,39szau,sorin7486,3,Mon Jun 15 01:00:02 2015 UTC,"Just ""case 1"" uses:    Cheaper, longer lived satellites. Satellites (especially geosynchronous ones) are limited on their operational life by the amount of fuel they can carry for correcting their orbit and alignment. The Emdrive would substantially reduce the mass launched (no fuel) and result in cheaper sats overall (longer life, less mass). A derivation of this: unlimited roaming and mission adaptable satellites and probes. Spy and scientific satellites could move anywhere in Earth's orbit and the inner Solar System with solar panels, anywhere else if they carry the appropriate power supply (e.g. nuclear RTGs).  Cubesats could last as long as their energy source does (solar panels most of the time). If launched in high enough orbits, this would allow interplanetary cubesats. Yes, amateur, cheapo Moon, Mars and Venus probes would be possible. Interplanetary Internet for real: if we can cheaply place long lived satellites anywhere around the Sun, we could create a communications backbone for any other satellite and ship on the Solar System with ease. Easier asteroid mining. Emdrive propelled drones could go all the way to the asteroids, prospect them... and push them wherever you want them. Probably very slowly, but you want to be careful with those chunks of rock anyway. This may make some governments and people nervous, though, so it could be a heavily regulated usage case in the future, or flat out forbidden above some asteroid masses. Emdrives could also deliver refined/manufactured products wherever they are needed. Practical space structure building: if you don't have to worry about fuel and autonomy in range, you can program robots to do very complex tasks by simply repeating arbitrarily long sequences of pushing, grappling, soldering and bolting things together, something that is impossible today. And do it with things that you can also very easily take from their production site and place them anywhere in deep space or in orb¡t around a planet. Feasible manned interplanetary missions. This usage has been widely mentioned by the NASA people, even with very modest Newtons per watt ratios. The problems of manned space missions grow much worse with long mission duration (recycling oxygen, water, supplies, risk of failures, radiation exposure, etc.). A faster propulsion technology would result in a lot of benefits maybe turning manned interplanetary missions from a pipe dream into finally feasible.  Deep space exploration: we could send probes farther and farther into deep space, exploring the furthest reaches of the Solar System in reasonable times (months, instead of decades).  A variant of this would be solar gravity telescopes. You need to be at a distance greater than 550 AU, to be able to use the Sun's gravity as a telescope with a huge (astronomically sized, really) lens, watching at a target placed in the celestial antipodes of your telescope wrt the Sun. You need a telescope for every target of interest, but with Emdrive tech you could launch hundreds of cheap mass made telescopes for exploring the celestial neighborhood in incredible levels of detail. Interstellar probes: NASA's EW team did some calculations for early interstellar missions to Alpha Centauri. If the thrust remains at any speed, these missions would be feasible in merely a few decades, and they would last a few decades too. This would require very high density and long lasting energy sources (nuclear reactors in space, basically), and a very developed communications infrastructure in space. But by the time anything like this is attempted, we could expect to have satellites all around the Solar System, and even some of them placed in the solar gravity focus point for any interstellar probe, allowing us to be in contact with the probes during all the mission ( but with a gradually growing and noticeable latency and lag, though)."

EmDrive,39szau,kowdermesiter,6,Sun Jun 14 21:34:16 2015 UTC,Kinetic energy increases with the square of velocity. An accelerating EmDrive will eventually accumulate more kinetic energy than you put in.  For Shawyer's proposed second-generation machine (efficiency 30N/W) this will happen when it reaches 33cm/s. It is trivial to construct a generator based on that.

In any case, for any drive with a greater thrust than a photon rocket you can always design a generator where it creates energy.  Edit: as an example, the Chinese experiment claims to produce 720 mN of thrust with 2500 W of power. Electrical generators are very efficient and can reach 98% at converting movement into electricity, but let's suppose just 95%. This means we'll be spending 2631 W after taking inefficiencies into account. To generate this power we'll need a speed of 2631 W / 0,72 N which is 3654 m/s. If we have a 50 meter wide wheel (something like a wind turbine) with the EmDrive attached, the wheel must turn 11,63 times per second to break even; anything faster than that and it becomes a free energy machine. This is slightly impractical to say the least, but with a device as powerful as Shawyer claims it can be anyone could have one in their basement for free electricity."

But your point, that there is a relatively low theoretical speed limit of 3654m/s, is appreciated. If this thing works, I'm extremely certain that it won't create energy. The simple way to accomplish that would be diminishing returns at higher velocities. If I learned anything about physics, the simple way is either completely wrong or at least slightly incorrect. So I'm speculating there would be some relativistic effect in play."

For 30 years in the 19th century they struggled with this until a Russian succeeded at eliminating it in the year 1900...by using a vacuum chamber to perform the measurements.  They are talking about using water to dampen the oscillations.  Experience with torsional pendulums show that they would be better off using oil to dampen the oscillations.  They should also eliminate the heat sources in the chamber: the lights in the chamber, as they cause natural convection currents in the air.

Living in California we had suspended a string with a weight on it about 4 foot long. It would start to move and oscillate on its own. The reason was minor tremors and earthquakes would cause the pendulum to move (P and S waves) as the waves from the quakes would travel under it. The rest of the earth would move but the end with the weight would not until it recentered itself to earth's gravity.   I was surprised at the number of minor quakes.

It is in the link Zouden posted just above: McColloch: ""Here's an analogy to explain where the energy in MiHsC comes from. A boat is on a sea with waves equal in all directions (the zpf). Suddenly a wall is put into the midst of that sea and damps waves near to it. Now the boat sees fewer waves hitting it from the direction of the wall than from the other direction so it moves towards the wall. If you were working with a physical model that usually ignores the sea and the wall (as standard dynamics does) then you'd think the energy was coming from nowhere. Hope this helps.."""

I mean with more detail, like how is the copper wall acting like an horizon just by bouncing the waves? Is there any acceleration and where and why is it? Thanks anyway. Sorry i'm slow here"
EmDrive,39lxbm,Zouden,2,Sat Jun 13 04:58:52 2015 UTC,"The Unruh waves are the source of what we call inertia. Some of the unruh waves that are generated by the accelerating photons are blocked by the small end of the cavity, so that the photons have more inertia at that location.   So it's like a man sitting in the front of a spaceship throwing a ball at the back. Each time he throws, the spaceship is pushed forwards (conservation of momentum). In the normal (non EmDrive) case, the ship is pushed backwards again when the ball hits the back wall so no net movement occurs. In the EmDrive, the ball is very heavy when he throws it but weighs almost nothing when it hits.  The EmDrive obtains energy from the zero point field (""waves on the ocean"") in order to move forward and conserve momentum. No laws are broken, and we tap into a new source of energy."
EmDrive,39lxbm,raresaturn,2,Sat Jun 13 08:49:23 2015 UTC,"In the EmDrive, the ball is very heavy when he throws it but weighs almost nothing when it hits.   Why?  Do the particles/waves decay uniformly but simply have further to go to reach the back, so they decay more by the time they get there?"
EmDrive,39lxbm,Zouden,2,Sat Jun 13 10:59:56 2015 UTC,"The unruh waves themselves can't fit in the small end of the chamber. Since those waves are the source of the photon's inertia, the photon has less inertia when it bounces off the small end."

EmDrive,39lxbm,lucassiglo21,9,Sat Jun 13 21:27:25 2015 UTC,that is the idea behind the casimir effect.
EmDrive,39lxbm,NicknameUnavailable,4,Sat Jun 13 01:25:41 2015 UTC,"Read up on Mach's Principle and The Woodward Effect.  They are basically what you've described.  TL;DR: Inertia is a property that emerges from everything in the universe exerting a force on everything else in the universe seemingly instantaneously because the force propagates backwards in time at the speed of light then gets bounced back forwards in time at the speed of light.  As Mach put it:   You are standing in a field looking at the stars. Your arms are resting freely at your side, and you see that the distant stars are not moving. Now start spinning. The stars are whirling around you and your arms are pulled away from your body. Why should your arms be pulled away when the stars are whirling? Why should they be dangling freely when the stars don't move?   According to Woodward's theory on the matter the EMDrive may actually be able to exploit this effect - because the energy-density changes at the two faces of the cavity (one side has more attenuated waves and the other has more multiplied waves - different wavelengths at the same energy levels = different physical size = different energy densities) - if the cavity vibrates just a little bit it would create a force.  To test if that is the explanation for it you could design the cavity in a resonant form with very periodic multiplication and attenuation and add some piezo actuators on each end that vibrate the cavity in phase with the time pulses inside the cavity strike each wall.  It would be very tricky to get everything tuned properly, but not theoretically impossible.  Since the EMDrive creator's theory would suggest you just need to make the cavity out of a super conductor to increase the energy --> force conversion it makes a lot more sense to start there (even if the Woodward Effect has some sound experimental data and is derived from existing theoretical proofs that are known to work - the superconducting cavity experiment is only going to cost a few thousand dollars to test whereas the Woodward Effect variation on the cavity would likely cost upwards of a half a million when you factor in engineering hours.)"

EmDrive,39lxbm,hopffiber,1 point,Sat Jun 13 13:29:25 2015 UTC,"People are referencing McCulloch and the Casimir effect (although I don't really think the Casimir effect is quite the same), but what you describe sounds a lot like a set of much older theories that tried to explain gravity by invoking some such aether force, pushing at stuff in all directions. The most famous variant is that of Le Sage's gravity (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le_Sage%27s_theory_of_gravitation). So it's a good and neat idea, but however, as they write on Wikipedia, these sorts of models are pretty conclusively ruled out by experimental results nowadays and they have theoretical difficulties as well. Most probably the same problems applies to McCullochs ideas as well."
EmDrive,39lxbm,autowikibot,1 point,Mon Jun 15 16:33:29 2015 UTC,"Le Sage's theory of gravitation:       Le Sage's theory of gravitation is a kinetic theory of gravity originally proposed by Nicolas Fatio de Duillier in 1690 and later by Georges-Louis Le Sage in 1748. The theory proposed a mechanical explanation for Newton's gravitational force in terms of streams of tiny unseen particles (which Le Sage called ultra-mundane corpuscles) impacting all material objects from all directions. According to this model, any two material bodies partially shield each other from the impinging corpuscles, resulting in a net imbalance in the pressure exerted by the impact of corpuscles on the bodies, tending to drive the bodies together. This mechanical explanation for gravity never gained widespread acceptance, although it continued to be studied occasionally by physicists until the beginning of the 20th century, by which time it was generally considered to be conclusively discredited.

EmDrive,39neci,bbasara007,2,Sat Jun 13 00:06:23 2015 UTC,"Think of it this way. If we'd have a slightly bigger pressure on one side due to electrons, air molecules or whatever hitting it slightly more often than on the other side the pressure needed for the thrust is something like 6.728×10-6 torr (values for nasas vacuum test). That is a few billion times smaller than atmospheric pressure. The thrust is only a bit bigger than sunlight hitting it. Talking while performing the test, the lights in your room, air moving at a few cm/min, temperature differences all those things literally influence the result. Such small fluctuations can be caused by nearly anything. Most of these things have been discussed but a clear error margin for specific effects has not been given for any of the error sources. A clear neglect if you ask me. It sure is fancy to come up with complex theories. But what is it worth if your theory can't be tested because of all the error noises making the measured results unusable. Right now it is highly likely it is caused by an effect. The guys at nasa spaceflight are waiting for better test results and in the mean time come up with theories that could explain a good test which right now simply does not exist. They all know that 100% can be explained by error sources and are in the IF it works mindset."

It's a huge part of the retrograde chart, and it's too strong to not be explained. It can't be device-specific friction, because it sets in at different rotation rates (250 for retrograde, 160 for prograde). Besides, there shouldn't be any low-speed friction with magnetic levitation. Double-besides, this is accelerated braking, which shouldn't really occur in any type of friction.  Your final trendlines are as good as the source material allows, but we need to know much more before starting to calculate slopes."
EmDrive,39ca2j,TortugaTerritory,8,Thu Jun 11 14:53:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I agree with everything you said. I did the best I could with the trend lines, but there's so much inconsistency in the experiment that I would hardly consider it valid.  -The tests start at different velocities  -The tests start the engine at different times (and different velocities)  -The deceleration of the retrograde is higher than the prograde, even without the engine  -There doesn't seem to be any change in slope after the retrograde thruster is turned on"

They may need to launch it a bit higher (similar to Hubble's orbit at 550 km), maybe higher in order to make the drag insignificant compared to the thrust.  This might be a problem, if the thrust is too low and it requires an orbit higher than what NASA or others provide to cubesats, in order to see the cubesat move without being overwhelmed by atmospheric drag.  http://forum.nasaspaceflight.com/index.php?topic=37642.msg1387454#msg1387454"

Thus they ought to have some mechanical rotor to impinge that constant starting torque.  Therefore the characteristics of the curve of slowdown due to air friction should be well know to them for asserting there is an acceleration in the retrograde or prograde sense.  It would be great, though, if they provided a null test slowdown curve, to see what's the normal rate of decay and compare vs the retrograde and prograde thrust tests."

This is promising but the result could easily be caused by air resistance since they've changed the shape of the platform. They really need to show an effect caused by a powered-up EmDrive vs and unpowered one, and I'm surprised they didn't do that experiment first."
EmDrive,39ca2j,zurael,8,Wed Jun 10 20:43:07 2015 UTC,"they mentioned that they plan to do a test inside a vacuum bell, not sure what strength of vacuum but it would atleast mostly rule out air resistance. looking forward to that test"

EmDrive,39ca2j,Zouden,12,Wed Jun 10 21:04:59 2015 UTC,"Still, for such a sensitive experiment we need to be absolutely sure that the drag profile hasn't changed.  Regarding the red line, the platform is wobbling before they switch on the emdrive so we can't make before/after comparisons there.  Finally, they need to repeat the experiment multiple times to get a measure of the standard deviation so they can make a statistical comparison... they're probably doing that right now."
EmDrive,39ca2j,Magnesus,1 point,Wed Jun 10 21:13:36 2015 UTC,Keep in mind that the change starts to occur only when they turn the device on. Before that both tests behave the same.
EmDrive,39ca2j,jpcoffey,5,Thu Jun 11 07:23:30 2015 UTC,I wish they could modify it to stay still (eliminate the imbalances it has in weight) and then switch it on and leave it on as long as they can and see if it starts moving. that would leave little doubt about the result
EmDrive,39ca2j,Magnesus,4,Thu Jun 11 04:19:58 2015 UTC,Isn't the thrust lower than friction though? It would probably not move.

EmDrive,39ca2j,goocy,2,Thu Jun 11 13:31:44 2015 UTC,There shouldn't be any static friction; the whole device is levitating magnetically.
EmDrive,39ca2j,api,7,Thu Jun 11 21:27:46 2015 UTC,"Assuming there's no error here, this is very significant -- the power levels here are low enough that I highly doubt convection or heat as an explanation.  How many replications is this? Shawyer's original claim, NASA Eagleworks, and now two indies? Or are there three? I'm not counting the Chinese one since it's a bit suspect.  Any chance you could thermally image it or otherwise measure temperature accurately?  Edit: just thought of a fantastic test for thermal effects:  (1) Measure the thermal profile.  (2) Do a placebo test with a small heater to replicate the same thermal profile but no drive. Or alternately replace the RF source with a small heater that dissipates the same amount of thermal energy.  Also how would your device fare in a partial or total vacuum, and how does your thrust/watt efficiency compare with the big version measurements to date?  Edit #2:  Here's an idea: keep going! MEMS fabrication and a visible light or infrared laser diode driver? Print arrays of these, sandwich them together, and make electromotive smart materials. You could embed in fiberglass or composites right into the skin of an aircraft or spacecraft, and have each individual ""pixel"" size unit computer controlled. You'd have a craft that could maneuver in 360 degrees with the accuracy of an industrial stepping motor. Even if thrusts remained small, something like that could be used to build smart ""software defined"" space structures out of a mass produced set of common core components.  If this thing actually works, it'd take decades to even begin to scratch the surface of potential applications. I can think of terrestrial uses for that in industry."

This is helpful:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorentz_force  But I'm still not completely sure how this would map to this experiment. Are you suggesting interaction with the Earth's magnetic field or something more local?  Note that in this case there is an on-board battery rather than a cord or wire involved, which I like. I was suspicious of interaction with the EM field from the power line in other experiments, but here the battery is part of the same object so it'd be ""pushing against itself"" in that case."
EmDrive,39ca2j,Eric1600,2,Fri Jun 12 07:07:36 2015 UTC,"When an EM wave is passing through a waveguide or wires or whatever, it induces current on the metal objects around it.  You get eddy currents which cause attenuation to the main wave but they have fields of their own as well and, while weaker, can introduce current to other areas of the device.  Wherever you have charge flowing there is the opportunity to produce force.  Since I've worked with 3d em problems a lot they can work in very non-intuitive ways.  It is not unlikely that they are generating some force externally.  This is why you see many of the testers trying to keep their devices far from surrounding metal objects.  It's a complicated test setup, very difficult to predict or debug.  The higher the power that is used the more likely a lorenz force could be involved in the motion.  For example many of the tests have a lot of metal around.  http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-RmVjnqghEIU/U-Fz0J73CsI/AAAAAAAAxK4/nNXYdDRUxM0/s1600/nasatestemdrive1.png  They try to rule out the fact that it isn't a lorenz force by simply replacing the resonator with a 50 ohm load (a resistor).  However I know from personal experience that a 50 ohm load with no radiating fields can impact 2nd or 3rd order effects very differently from having a real resonator.  It's a good test, but it is not a definitive way to rule out subtle EM effects."
EmDrive,39ca2j,api,1 point,Fri Jun 12 17:03:44 2015 UTC,Hmm... So get away from metal then. Build as much as possible out of plastics and ceramics and take it out to a dry lake bed? :)  Is the levitation of magnets over a superconductor an extreme example of the feedback you are describing?
EmDrive,39ca2j,autowikibot,2,Fri Jun 12 18:44:25 2015 UTC,"It's not quite that simple as just removing metal.  You'll notice that a lot of these test setups have some kind of force being measured even with the EM drive off.  They just subtract the difference and call that the em drive's power.  Levitation of magnets is unrelated.  That's a magnet suspended in a flow of circulating current.  We don't know where the source of the Em Drive force is coming from however accelerators like the LHC use very strong EM fields to accelerate particles.  These high power EM fields require superconducting cavities to sustain them.  This is exactly the condition that Shawyer is trying to replicate only the LHC is probably 1000x more powerful, yet no one has observed any significant forces or loss of energy in these larger, very high power systems.  So if we just put these things together it would seem that the small residual force that is there with the Em Drive off, is probably a Lorenz type force due to the system, the increase with the Em Drive on is probably contributing a little more and since the LHC superconducting resonators haven't flown off into space it would seem the the arguement is solid that the Em Drive's force won't increase much more because it is a leakage of charge causing a complex Lorenz force rather than something new and unknown.  I'm not saying that's definite.  I'm saying that's what it looks like without having more rigorous and careful testing.  We really need more data with highly controlled test setups and skilled people to control the experiments."

If a particle of charge q moves with velocity v in the presence of an electric field E and a magnetic field B, then it will experience a force     (in SI units). Variations on this basic formula describe the magnetic force on a current-carrying wire (sometimes called Laplace force), the electromotive force in a wire loop moving through a magnetic field (an aspect of Faraday's law of induction), and the force on a charged particle which might be traveling near the speed of light (relativistic form of the Lorentz force).  The first derivation of the Lorentz force is commonly attributed to Oliver Heaviside in 1889,  although other historians suggest an earlier origin in an 1865 paper by James Clerk Maxwell.  Hendrik Lorentz derived it a few years after Heaviside.

EmDrive,39fgc2,cheetah_swirley,5,Thu Jun 11 10:52:20 2015 UTC,"To keep the equations consistent you need conservation of momentum. If you don't you get in trouble when trying to calculate energies because all inertial reference frames are valid, this means energy calculation must be the same no matter what the relative speed of the observer. In practice, no matter what the efficiency of a reactionless drive an observer will always see it creating energy (we're talking classical physics here and ignoring relativity, where a drive with the efficiency of a photon rocket won't, but in the meantime we're not moving at relativistic speeds so we can safely use Newton here)  An example, and I hope to not screw the math up since it's quite simple. Say you have a 1000 kg gun in space that shoots a 1 kg shell at 1000 m/s. The gun itself is now moving in the opposite direction of the shell at 1 m/s to conserve momentum.  A observer that was stationary will see the gun now with a energy of 500 joules, and the shell with an energy of 500000 joules so the total energy converted from chemical energy into kinetic is 500500 J.   Now consider a new observer who was previously traveling towards the rear of the gun when it fires at 1000 m/s. When the gun fires, now he sees the shell as stationary, and the gun is cruising at 1001 m/s. According to this observer the system's previous kinetic energy was ½ * 1001 * 10002 J, which adds to 500500000 J, and now is  1/2* 1000 * 10012 which adds to 501000500. The difference between both is again 500500 J so both obsevers agree on how much energy was converted from chemical into kinetic.   The same way, if the now moving gun fires again, you can calculate how energy is conserved again for both observers.  Consider now a 1000 kg ship with a truly reactionless drive, again floating in space. It's pilot sees it creating a force of 100 newtons for 10 seconds, and doing so spends 1000 joules of energy on electricity powering the device. By doing so the ship is accelerated at 0.1 m/s2 to a final speed relative to it's final position of 1 m/s. It's kinetic energy is now relative to an observer initially at rest with it of 500 joules, so this drive seems to be 50% efficient and doesn't break CoE.  But what happens with an observer who was moving towards the ship at 1000 m/s? He saw the ship initially with a kinetic energy of ½ * 1000 * 10002 = 500000000 J, and now with an energy of 1/2* 1000* 10012 = 501000500, gaining 1000500 J of kinetic energy and creating 999500 J out of nothing.  And the same thing will eventually happen to the stationary observer, as you noted on the OP; sooner or later he'll see the craft creating energy when it has accelerated enough.  So, to answer the OP, once you consider all the system meaning also the reaction mass, you don't have to worry about inconsistences. Sometimes you don't when the reaction mass is very large, like when you're using the whole planet as your propellant as you do when you apply the equations to cars, trains of planes or agree on a “true” frame of reference (again, the surface of the planet)  Edit: typos."
EmDrive,39fgc2,Rowenstin,1 point,Thu Jun 11 13:13:19 2015 UTC,"hmmm just a thought, obviously my level of physics is completely inadequate to really speculate properly, but if CoE is being violated by a reactionless drive by a specific amount from a reference frame doesnt that mean that it is also being violated by exactly the equal and opposite quantity from the exactly opposite reference frame in relationship to the object.  moving away from the ship at a 1000m/s in opposite direction to propulsion in your example  so Sigma of (Coe violations) will = 0  if it does turn out to work in space it would appear there Conservation of mass/energy wouldnt be wrong as much as need to be revised to some kind conservation of mass/energy/space.  i.e. we will have to start considering energy and mass as vector quantities rather than scalar... which would be freaky as fuck because then it wouldnt be against the laws of physics in specific situations to multiply mass or energy outwards into equal and opposite directions from a starting points.  i find the idea of splitting a single object into two equal and opposite objects propelling away from eachother being an engineering not a physics problem hilarious  EDIT: OH shit i just realised that scientists have observed that space itself is expanding. the universe is growing in equal and opposite directions all the time.  so sigma of Conservation of space violations = 0"
EmDrive,39fgc2,TortugaTerritory,1 point,Fri Jun 12 21:09:23 2015 UTC,You don't need kinetic energy equation to get power = velocity x force. Proof:  work = force * distance  work / time = force * distance / time  work / time = power  distance / time = velocity  therefore power = force * velocity
EmDrive,39fgc2,sorin7486,1 point,Thu Jun 11 15:25:12 2015 UTC,i know. i wasnt clear in OP. i meant that i could also derive the power velocity force equation from work done equation.  to explain that i feel like i have a pretty good grasp of that equation but power= force x velocity is completely unintuitive to me
EmDrive,39fgc2,-KR-,0,Fri Jun 12 20:50:16 2015 UTC,"Another way to think about your equations is this: if kinetic energy = 0.5mv2, that means that the energy grows exponentially with speed. Applying constant power to an object means the amount of energy that object receives grows linearly not exponentially. This is why constant power does not translate into constant acceleration. If you want constant acceleration you need exponential energy growth.  I hope this helps :)"
EmDrive,39fgc2,sorin7486,2,Thu Jun 11 11:35:04 2015 UTC,"Quadratic, not exponential. Exponential would be 2v and not v2."
EmDrive,39fgc2,sorin7486,1 point,Thu Jun 11 12:08:13 2015 UTC,"Yes, if you want to be precise. I'm not very good with math ;)"
EmDrive,39fgc2,mjmax,0,Thu Jun 11 13:50:51 2015 UTC,"Hi,  I don't think it's the conservation of energy which people claim is being violated, but conservation of momentum. Conservation of energy says that the energy of an isolated system will stay constant over time. In the case of the EmDrive you could say that the drive uses electrical energy and gains kinetic energy, which is fine.  The conservation of momentum on the other hand says that for the same system momentum is constant as well. So mass x velocity = constant. But since the EmDrive looses no mass, it's impossible for it to gain speed. The only explanation (if it works) is that the system is not actually isolated, and it's pushing against something. What that something is, we don't know, but it will be interesting to find out.  Now the equations you asked about, the way to think about it is like this: let's say you have an object moving at constant speed, and you push against it with a constant force for 1 second. The work resulted (energy you imparted to that object) is = force x speed x time. If you increase the speed it means you're giving it more energy in that one second. So you can also say that the amount of power required to apply a certain amount of force to that moving object is = force x speed. Now for an object which is accelerating at constant acceleration you will need increasing amounts of power to keep that acceleration up. And this has nothing to do with the theory of relativity. When you get up to relativistic speeds the mass of the object also starts going up.  I know all of this is rather strange and the reason for that is that in real life we very rarely see constant forces or constant acceleration."
EmDrive,39fgc2,sorin7486,5,Thu Jun 11 11:29:07 2015 UTC,"No, people are actually claiming it also breaks conservation of energy. The idea is that with constant force and mass you get constant acceleration, but kinetic energy increases quadratically while energy input only increases linearly. Therefore, at some point the kinetic energy out will exceed the energy put in."
EmDrive,39fgc2,sorin7486,1 point,Thu Jun 11 15:01:41 2015 UTC,"Well, that's if you claim that you can get constant force and I see no reason to make such a claim. You would have to presume you understand what is going on in that thing and I would say that evidence shows we don't. I'd say let's get some solid data about what is happening first, and theorize about it after. But if it does turn out to violate conservation of energy then it's going to be really interesting to figure out how."
EmDrive,39fgc2,sorin7486,2,Thu Jun 11 18:44:38 2015 UTC,"Well, that's if you claim that you can get constant force and I see no reason to make such a claim.   Except relativity, you mean. If the force changes with your change of velocity relative to something then you can tell your absolute velocity relative to the preferred frame, which doesn't exist under relativity. This is a very good reason for the force not to depend on velocity.   Note: I'm not saying it can't, just that there is a good reason for it not to, contrary to what you say."

EmDrive,399nnt,bbasara007,11,Wed Jun 10 09:26:20 2015 UTC,"Most people would say it's very unlikely that we'll find a reactionless drive, given that known laws of physics prohibit it. If there's a one-in-a-billion chance of X happening and a two-in-a-billion chance of Y happening, then Y is twice as likely as X. That's why we really seriously have to eliminate all possible experimental errors on this one, even those that seem really unlikely.  (My estimate of how likely the emdrive is has risen significantly since I started reading McCulloch's writings, but his ideas are just untested hypotheses so far, and they'll need very careful experiments too.)"

If you look at criticism about the Emdrive tests (from outside NSF) the most common complaint is about thermal effects (such as heating of the air) since it's the most obvious and intuitive source of erroneous thrust. That's why so many people were witholding their opinion until after the eagleworks vacuum test. The result of that test made headlines as it was seen as the end of the thermal hypothesis.

It seems to me that you are wrong assuming it is a ""hot air balloon"". But thermal factors could be at play there. For instance, if you make an assumption for a moment that the Q factor is a driving factor behind the thrust, then it could be possible that a particular construction of frustum has good matching at a certain temperature above its initial temperature.  Noting that shawyer has put an adjustable small endplate in his, perhaps (though I have no idea) it could be that they are adjusting that with some feedback system. But I'm just musing.

EmDrive,397hwd,bbasara007,3,Tue Jun 9 21:06:07 2015 UTC,"To answer your question, there is no single definition of a hard vacuum (assuming the OP means hard when they say true, I've never heard of a ""true"" vacuum before).  I think what OP meant to say is that the actual vacuum conditions of space are still quite a bit lower than what the EW's vacuum chamber got to, as you can see in this comment by Rodal"
EmDrive,397hwd,LoreChano,2,Tue Jun 9 23:03:08 2015 UTC,You're right but it is the air outside the cavity that is relevant. Just dividing the force measured by the projected area in thrust direction gives us this thrust/area or in simpler terms: a pressure difference needed between front and back. Let me assume the values for the vacuum test NASA performed. A small calculation but yields 6.728×10-6 torr. Which is at the same order of magnitude of the pressure they are measuring at. This is not a perfect vacuum and such a pressure difference can easily be achieved by uneven heating. It also shows that measuring thrust at ambient conditions is idiotic. Every fluid dynamics engineer knows how fringe this thing is. But despite this obvious result not a single calculation or simulations has been performed. It hasn't even been mentioned once after the vacuum tests.
EmDrive,397hwd,Bot_Marvin,3,Wed Jun 10 22:00:46 2015 UTC,"Then how do you explain tests were the force was measured to go downwards? There were many reasons for the EW tests to produce less thrust. The hot baloon theory is a really simple minded way to look at it and the teams of scientists have already looked over that issue obviously. You really need to do some more research on the subject, I suggest reading through the NSF forums again because if you came out of it with a conclusion that its a unanimous feeling that the hot air baloon theory explains the force then you misread somewhere. There have already been experiments that involved testing the temperatures, a google search could give you that."
EmDrive,3940p5,Readitigetit,20,Tue Jun 9 02:36:44 2015 UTC,"The goal that most scientific skeptics have isn't to just say it doesn't work.  A skeptic needs to be proven how and why something should work, then build something based on those principles and have it work as predicted and be repeatable.  And right now the how it should work part is extremely speculative based on very little known science or science that doesn't make sense.  At this point, everyone should be skeptical because no one can really explain how it works and build something based on those principles.  We are in the experimental phase with a lot of amateurs muddying the waters.  Having worked in microwave engineering, it is very easy to build sometime slightly wrong, not know it, and wonder why it doesn't do exactly what it should be doing.  Since there have been several tests which show the thrust of the Em Drive changing depending on the direction (which according to all the theories it should not do), I think the test setup for these experiments is absolutely critical to get right.  Since the pros at Eagleworks also observed this problem with orientation, it seems likely it may take a lot of experimenting to get to the bottom of what is happening.    The problem with thrust changing vs orientation has proven in my experience 99% of the time to be a test setup issue.  EM fields are 3-d, complex and do very unexpected things.  How they interact in a test setup like this is impossible to predict because the full system can't be easily modeled.  Yes you can model the resonator, that's easy, waveguides too, but you have to think bigger.   There are cables, power supplies, AC, DC and RF ground planes, motors, other metal objects around that could be coupling into the system.  It's very complex."

Test results show wildly inconsistent results both in orientation and produced thrust with the tighter controlled tests at Eagleworks showing the least thrust.  http://emdrive.wiki/Experimental_Results

This is also about the Cannae drive too and no mention of scientists dismissing it, just applying the standard burden of proof.   Restating: the researchers measured thrust when the drive was all set up to produce thrust, but they also measured thrust when it was set up to do nothing at all. That the null test article produced thrust is really suspicious. Either it's a measurement error, or this drive produces thrust by some mechanism that isn't explained by the semi-plausible physics backing it up and this breakthrough in spacecraft propulsion is working by some not-even-theoretical mechanism.  Now, which is more likely?   Eight days of initial tests on a piece of controversial technology in a NASA lab have proven all-new, extraordinary, physics-revolutionizing spacecraft propulsion in a manner so spectacular that the drive works even when it isn't set up to do anything at all; or Somewhere in the testing process is some sort of procedural, mechanical, or interference error producing false results."

He and a few other critics have said this would satisfy them.  If it can cause a satellite to move from one orbit to another, or even just maintain an orbit for a long enough time, that is all the proof needed.

To get to that point you'll need to build one out of space-rated components, and subject it to a lot of testing prior to launch (high-G, hard vacuum, radiation)... which means you'd be replicating the existing experiments anyway, as you'd need to check that it still produces thrust during/after each test.

The fact that thrust is different depending on orientation implies there is some sort of Lorenz effect with the setup, the resonator or something less interesting.  When an test object performs differently depending on how it is oriented, when all theory says it shouldn't change, that implies there is a problem with the setup."

You can see that it was only about 330 times greater than a photon rocket.  In my opinion, as the quality and methodology of emdrive experiments improve, the thrust will ultimately drop to zero.  It's been the governing trend so far.    So yes, I would definitely agree there are some serious setup problems, and a significant and unexpected change in thrust with the best setup to date indicates there is still a lot of work to be done."
EmDrive,3940p5,wallofwolfstreet,3,Tue Jun 9 16:55:59 2015 UTC,"Thanks.  That's almost a factor of 2 change (scaling for input power differences).  I would say that's a bad sign for the EM Drive.  The steadying decrease is interesting.  Perhaps there needs to be a new experiment designed to show Lorenz forces in a similar situation.  It might be hard to isolate the system down to 0 without understanding the mechanism.  RE: Roldal's comments.  I think the quest for vacuum testing is a little misguided.  I understand the desire to get this to work in space, but it seems that thermals have been ruled out.  It would be better to focus on the setup itself with higher powers and careful near field probing for RF leaks and coupling."

EmDrive,391bye,bitofaknowitall,10,Mon Jun 8 15:09:57 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the great summary!  I've been reading through Todd's (WarpTech's) posts and I'm really not convinced by any of his arguments. In his paper he says that the EmDrive doesn't accumulate kinetic energy beyond the input energy, because it behaves like ""hovering in a gravitational field"" which he says uses energy without gaining kinetic energy:   In order to remain stationary at a given altitude in a gravitational field, a constant force must be exerted, along with a constant acceleration and a constant input power. There is no gain in altitude, no increase in the potential energy and no increase in velocity. Although power and force are being expended constantly.   Does hovering use energy? No! No movement occurs, so no work (force * distance) occurs so the energy consumption is 0J. WarpTech does not acknowledge this. He then says:   Therefore, a constant thrust-to-power, N/kW thruster will reach a maximum kinetic energy   So we're back to the idea of a terminal velocity. This is ridiculous.  Imagine an EmDrive-powered starship that accelerates from Earth until it reaches its ""maximum"" kinetic energy and can't go any faster so the EmDrive switches off. It then catches up to a mothership for docking. The dock manager of the mothership says ""we're closing the doors in 15 minutes, if you speed up then you'll just make it."" The captain replies ""sorry, we're at our maximum kinetic energy, our EmDrive won't work any more."" But relative to the mothership, the ship is moving very slowly so it has very little kinetic energy.  NSF member wallofwolfstreet asked WarpTech about this problem. His response?    Because, when the engine was running, every sub-atomic particle of matter was accelerated and in dong so, their momentum increased. Relative to where it started from, the wavelength of every matter-wave has been reduced in size and this represents the real stored energy of inertia. Therefore, the matter that was accelerated ""knows"" it was accelerated because it possesses more inertia than when it started.   This is nonsense! The EmDrive ""knows"" that it can't switch on again? We'll just have to build a new one and let this one drift in the darkness."

(interpretations are in quotes because I don't know if they are actually compatible with currently accepted physics)    Essentially, he is using a significantly different (and not at all supported by the mainstream) interpretation of modern physics.  That doesn't mean it's wrong of course.  I read his paper and addressed it as best I could in this post."
EmDrive,391bye,wallofwolfstreet,6,Mon Jun 8 22:33:08 2015 UTC,"Oh I see, that changes things somewhat.

My main motivation for writing the post I linked was that I felt people reading the forum would come across Warptechs posts and just believe that is how Relativity works. I think I just wanted to kind of get in there and shout:  ""Hold on a sec.  Is any of this actually backed up by mainstream, peer-reviewed science?""  As far as I can tell from following some of Warptech's links, the answer is no.  This is not a currently accepted interpretation of physics.  That's not bad in and of itself, but when you make a post on a forum that thousands of people will read, it's only fair you add a little postscript saying: ""Most people doing research in physics right now don't actually agree with what I'm saying"""
EmDrive,391bye,wallofwolfstreet,5,Mon Jun 8 22:59:56 2015 UTC,The break-even point of an EmDrive with efficiency of 1N/W is exactly 1m/s. Does warptech really think that the EmDrive can't go faster than walking speed?
EmDrive,391bye,Zouden,3,Tue Jun 9 06:37:23 2015 UTC,"According to his theory, yes.  It's not just the EMdrive either.  If you go through his paper, his argument applies equally well to anything with an efficiency of 1 N/W.  He is basically saying there is some mechanism in the universe that causes things to never be able to go faster than the velocity where they make more energy than they take in.  I tried to address all the problems with that in this post, to little effect."
EmDrive,391bye,wallofwolfstreet,3,Tue Jun 9 14:55:07 2015 UTC,"I've been reading a fair bit of the forum tonight and I have to say I'm impressed with your patience and restraint.  I just realised another bit of silliness implied by WarpTech's theory (this has surely been pointed out on the NSF forum): a less-efficient EmDrive has a higher max speed. If the thrust/power ratio is 0.1N/W then it can go as fast as 10m/s. It's madness. I think WarpTech is concocting these ideas because he really wants the EmDrive to work without generating free energy. But he's breaking all of physics in the process.  Anyway, It looks like he's finally admitting there's cracks in his paper."
EmDrive,391bye,Zouden,5,Tue Jun 9 19:12:31 2015 UTC,"I actually don't think that has been addressed over there (so feel free to make an account and give it a post!), but you're exactly right.  To go faster, all you have to do is drop the efficiency of your drive.  You don't make free energy, but the idea that you can only go as fast as how inefficient your drive is, seems weird.  I think the bigger issue is that it's easy to think of things that have thrust to power ratios that are infinite.  I show that in this comment here.  By Wartech's paper, there should be a whole class of mundane, household objects that should never move, because they have a limiting velocity of 0."
EmDrive,391bye,wallofwolfstreet,2,Tue Jun 9 19:45:51 2015 UTC,It seems to me WarpTech's proposing a principle for conservation of energy similar to how Hawking's chronology protection conjecture deals with time machines.

Could you create a hypothetical rocket with 1,000 EMdrives at 1N/W efficency connected in parallel (each with their own cavity & microwave generators) to achieve 1000m/s velocity?"
EmDrive,391bye,tomoldbury,1 point,Wed Jun 10 14:46:50 2015 UTC,"I don't have the answer to your first two questions, but I can say that 1000 EMdrives at 1 N/W would still only be able to achieve 1 m/s.  This is because in Todd's theory, the emdrive is somehow limited in its thrust by the inertia it has relative to its initial inertial frame.  So adding more EMdrives doesn't help you, you're still limited to the velocity of your least efficient drive."
EmDrive,391bye,wallofwolfstreet,1 point,Wed Jun 10 14:58:38 2015 UTC,OK that's odd. Now I'm wondering what happens if you change all but one emdrive on the rocket to 0.1N/W. That single engine limits the whole drive? What defines an emdrive? A rock has a 0N/W efficiency so why does it not accelerate towards infinity?
EmDrive,391bye,AtheistGuy1,1 point,Wed Jun 10 16:05:09 2015 UTC,"The answer to your first question is yes.  All of the other 1 N/W drives would cease to produce thrust when you hit 1 m/s, and you're 0.1 N/W drive would then accelerate you up to 10 m/s before conking out itself.  The maximum speed you reach is defined by the least efficient drive.      As to the other questions, you'll have to ask Todd directly.  I'm really not qualified to say exactly how he'd interpret them."

EmDrive,391bye,tchernik,3,Mon Jun 8 19:33:58 2015 UTC,"I think I understand what WarpTech is trying to say with the limits of acceleration of the EMdrive. I'll try to keep it simple as it's not that tough to understand if you make it simple. Feel free to say different.  Imagine you are on a spaceship just putting along, not accelerating just coasting, doesn't really matter where you're coasting, but everything is just a point of light outside your window.  How do you know how fast you are going? How does the universe know how fast you are going? How does space somehow keep track your speed? And remember it has to because space has set some limits on how fast you can go so it has to have an something to keep track.   Everyone knows what Einstein said, as you approach the speed of light to a outside observer if they could see you zooming past and they were not traveling as fast as you, you would appear to shorten in length in the direction of travel and your mass increasing. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_of_light  What has happened? The very matter you and your ship is made of compresses, spacetime compresses, the distance between the fundamental particles that make up the atoms shrinks. This shrinkage between all the particles that makes up your ship is the way space knows how fast you are going and that can be directly related to the energy it took you to get your ship, the EMdrive and every little piece of subatomic particle that makes you up. You could say that energy you used was stored in the space between all the subatomic particles that makes you the ship and everything on it.  This is the limit WarpTech is referring about.  We know Einstein said you can't tell the difference between being in an elevator accelerating up or down and gravity. So in a gravity field,  like right now you are sitting in your chair reading this you are feeling the pull of the earth. You could not tell and there would be no test you could do to tell you the difference that you were not accelerating in a ship at 1G or in a gravity field of 1G. Hovering in a gravity field is the same as accelerating if you want to keep your position."

You could gain more height or speed with the help of conventional thrusters, though.  Something quite similar to what Roger Shawyer said at first, in fact. But then he changed his speech to say that he figured out that you could modulate the frequency/power of the microwaves to tune them with a changing cavity, and remain producing a strong thrust nearly at any speed (which takes us again into the known CoM, CoE issues).  I guess experiments will say which theory is actually true. Or not (maybe none is true)."

The maximum speed of the first EmDrive is 1m/s (WarpTech agrees with this figure) while the weaker EmDrive can go up to 10m/s. This is because the weaker drive wastes energy, so it's ""allowed"" to accumulate more kinetic energy to compensate.  It's not even science fiction - it's total fantasy."

EmDrive,38xbn7,MALON,13,Sun Jun 7 17:15:39 2015 UTC,"According to Mike McCulloch, the EmDrive doesn't violate CoM because the photons themselves lose inertia, forcing the EmDrive forwards to preserve overall CoM. It also doesn't violate CoE, because it derives energy from the zero point field. Lorentz invariance is also preserved in this model so no physics is broken and everyone is happy.  That's if the EmDrive works as Dr McCulloch says."
EmDrive,38xbn7,Zouden,11,Sun Jun 7 18:23:23 2015 UTC,"McCulloch's work is the reason I recently became more optimistic. However from what I've seen, he actually doesn't deny that the emdrive would violate conservation of energy.   Before Einstein, we had conservation of mass, and separately we had conservation of energy. Einstein unified them to conservation of mass-energy. A 19th-century scientist would have thought a nuclear power plant violates CoE, but we know it converts mass to energy.  Now we have conservation of mass-energy, and conservation of information. McCulloch's theory says it's actually conservation of mass-energy-information, and that's why it's possible for the emdrive to violate CoE.  McCulloch's theory also explains our observations of the universe without needing to invoke dark energy or dark matter, neither of which we've ever detected. And he claims it explains a bunch of other weird little anomalies, too. But for most things its predictions are very close to standard physics.  It's one of several attempted explanations for inertia, none of which are proven so far. He's proposed several experiments, aside from the emdrive, to test the hypothesis."

To conserve momentum the cavity has to move towards the narrow end.""  So in other words in a traditional sense conservation of energy is broken (as the closed system gains energy from the zpf), but if you consider the zpf an external energy source then it checks out. Conservation of momentum is not broken.  Source: http://physicsfromtheedge.blogspot.co.uk/2015/05/emdrive-whence-motion.html"

There is just enough data to perceive it is pushing, creating thrust.  Maybe a better question and a more pertinent one would be what would the naysayers think and say if it did violate CoE, CoM and The Laws of Thermodynamics?    Anytime I've heard it can't work I think why did they become physicists or scientists if they are going to quit asking why? Asking why is IMHO the finest quality a engineer, scientist or physicist can have. Years of mind numbing school to learn because when you were young you wanted to know the why. That is what drove you through school and striving for knowledge, not that something it can't work, it's a piece of poo. My question to them is when did you loose the why that made you what you are?"

I don't think they got where they are by sitting idly - but instead by using their time selectively. I also imagine such individuals are either employed on commercial enterprises or in research institutes working towards set timelines and goals which are (in the short term at least) fairly well defined.   Asking them to work on a project like the EM drive is analogous to asking them to come and work on a PKE Meter from the Ghostbusters. If there was some kind of amazing evidence that ghosts were real in the first place they might look into it but otherwise, why are they going to?

So it's about being open to the evidence, knowing you don't have all the answers, and wanting to seek out ""why"" something is the way it is even if it goes against everything you were taught.  It seems to me that some people seek ""why"" until they think they have all the answers, and then sit contently on top their knowledge, until something forcibly (And to much to their displeasure) shakes them up. For them it's not about ""why"" but about the comfort they find in saying ""I know""."

The lack of that skill (or the suspension of it) is a source of frustration for people who have it and want to use it.   For scientists, in order to even consider the EM drive as something possible, they first have to suspend their disbelief - which is not as easy as it sounds. It is a bit like watching a magic show and then saying to them later 'No, seriously - I saw that guy levitate, let's go and build some theories on it and discuss what to do next'.  Admittedly, magic is designed to deceive - which I don't believe is the case any more with the EM drive development. (Shawyer stands by his bunk science, which is very suspicious. Eagleworks is much more credible but nevertheless could easily be mistaken).   The quality of evidence is extremely poor - virtually worthless. Combined with the history of the physics that this data is trying to undo - it would be foolhardy for physicists to divert thought into it.   Much easier just to let Eagleworks provide something (if anything) worth looking at first. At the moment there is NOTHING worth looking at from a reasoned point of view."

That particular theory (mutable quantum vacuum) belongs to Sonny White, head of NASA eagleworks. He is not the emdrive inventor, who does not agree at all with White's theory. Basically White had been working on that pet theory for over a decade, and when the emdrive came along, he unsurprisingly decided his own pet theory happened to explain it.

There have been some tests that looked to be successful, but we don't know for sure. It could be that all of the tests were actually measuring something else.  Having said that, if sufficient evidence does turn out that this thing in fact works, then the scientists have to go off and figure out exactly why, and make their little theories fit together again. This is usually how new discoveries are made in physics after all: observation first, new theory later.

EmDrive,38xbn7,sorin7486,4,Sun Jun 7 17:40:17 2015 UTC,I find it annoying that everybody is more curious about how it works instead of how we can make it work better.

This happens all the time with people that think they have invented cold fusion, or some infinite source of energy. They often have experiments that support their claims and it's usually hard to show how those experiments are flawed. So being skeptical is a very good thing.  Now having said that, I agree with you. The important question to answer is does this really work? We already know that if it does, it means there's a whole part of physics we never knew about."

Shawyer is experimenting with superconducting, Iulian is creating a plate adjuster, TheTraveller just finished calculations for maximum thrust based on current theories to start building, and the hackaday guys are trying high frequencies in a small cavity in hopes to put it into space if it works.  Trust me, everyone wants to see the results and is working on more thrust!  Also, a big step towards that in all of these construction attempts is replicating the original experiment very closely. That way you have a base to work with, one that you know works, and then you can improve upon it. Most builders are working on their ""base"" setup to later expand on.  Until the builders finish and start releasing data, you're going to hear mostly from theorists speculating on why it works or doesn't."

The initial experiments seem to suggest it works alright, but it says nothing about how it'll behave at higher speeds. For all we know it might require more and more energy the faster it goes, therefore not really violating CoE. So yeah, wait and see.  I have seen people say it does indeed violate our current understanding of CoM, but that that understanding is too shallow.

No, that only helps you in the case of a photon drive because the photon drive's thrust to power ratio is 1/c. Anything higher than that and c will not save you from reaching higher output than input. And the reported ratios for the EmDrives are so much higher that the over-unity speeds are low enough for  relativistic corrections to be negligible.    ""just out of reach"" of ""free energy""   Definitely not if the inventor is right about it being scalable to 1N/W or higher. It would be quite trivial in this case as you would need just 1m/s relative to the starting point in order to get net output.  And even at the currently reported ratios from experiments (up to 1N/KW), a demonstration should be doable.

If the one is moving at near the speed of light and the other is at rest, the one would have a far greater mass and experience a lot of time dilation.  You can not change the reference frame and have the extra mass and time dilation apply to the other object all of a sudden.  The energy that is inside the one object will not transfer to the other object the instant that you change your reference frame.  Velocity might be relative, but energy isn't.  If it was and we had the situation where a fast moving emdrive is producing more energy than it consumes, you would simply change your reference frame and suddenly the emdrive will no longer be a free energy machine, or if your reference frame jumped to an particle moving at the speed of light in the opposite direction of the drive, that drive will now be producing infinite energy.

How does somebody on Mars calculate its kinetic energy? 0.5(m)(v2) = 0.5(1kg)(10m/s)2 = 50 J. How does somebody on Earth calculate its kinetic energy? 0.5(1kg)(10010m/s)2 = 50,100,000 J.

However, the practicality of actually extracting more energy than put in would depend on how easily it can get to the over-unity speed relative to the frame where you want to generate your energy.    or if your reference frame jumped to an particle moving at the speed of light in the opposite direction of the drive, that drive will now be producing infinite energy.

Photon drives preserve this perfectly: the photons leave in one direction and the ship goes in the opposite direction, with the increase of the ship's momentum being equal to momentum of the photons and the direction being opposite.

EmDrive,38xbn7,api,2,Sun Jun 7 23:53:17 2015 UTC,Cold fusion itself is pretty controversial since the 2009 paper that detected neutron flow from the reaction chamber: http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/03/090323110450.htm
EmDrive,38xbn7,kleinergruenerkaktus,3,Mon Jun 8 10:37:49 2015 UTC,I did not know that. I really hope that someone can reproduce that
EmDrive,38xbn7,api,1 point,Mon Jun 8 11:21:34 2015 UTC,As far as I've heard the neutron flow was reproduced but that is a far cry from extracting any power from the reaction.
EmDrive,38xbn7,Jigsus,-3,Mon Jun 8 11:28:09 2015 UTC,"That moderator is a dick.  It has been shown to work, he is ignoring evidence because it disagrees with his worldview."
EmDrive,38xbn7,kleinergruenerkaktus,-1,Sun Jun 7 22:16:44 2015 UTC,The emdrive definitely works. The independent verifications are stacking up and they can be considered overwhelming evidence.
EmDrive,38xbn7,Jigsus,5,Mon Jun 8 07:30:48 2015 UTC,"They can all have a common systematic error that invalidates all of them. All but the NASA ones were performed without sufficient scientific scrutiny. Publications are slim to none. If the experiments start to produce properly peer-reviewed science, we can talk. No, Chinese papers coming out of paper mills don't count."
EmDrive,38xbn7,Eryemil,1 point,Mon Jun 8 09:14:10 2015 UTC,Wow so you pick and choose your results. The very public tests like berca you choose to disregard but you feel comfortable declaring the opposite. Sounds like you have a heavy bias.  Why don't you try building one yourself?
EmDrive,38xbn7,ervza,8,Mon Jun 8 09:35:04 2015 UTC,"Wow so you pick and choose your results. The very public tests like berca you choose to disregard but you feel comfortable declaring the opposite. Sounds like you have a heavy bias.   Why should I give any attention to poorly controlled for homemade experiments? How do I know his experiment is not magic trick, like so many free energy devices on Youtube are, banking on excitement to get more views? Why should I pay attention to Shawyer, who wants to sell his invention and whose explanations clash with basic physics? Why should I pay attention to obscure Chinese labs which are subject to the poor Chinese scientific publishing culture? They didn't do any vacuum tests, so there is a huge source of experimental error in their experiments.  There is only one true EmDrive experimental setup at the moment, which is at NASA. They will go replicate at GRC, then they will publish a paper, then we can see if it works. Until then, this is all amateur hour.   Why don't you try building one yourself?   It would cost me too much time and money to do such a thing. Even then, there is no way I could create a setup that is more professional than the one at NASA, so there is no way I could control for the possible common experimental error that accounts for the anomalous thrust observed."
