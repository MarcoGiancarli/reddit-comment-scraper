carporn,3dy7qw,alec118,6,Mon Jul 20 21:32:24 2015 UTC,"Yes the short wheelbase cars were the 65-67 cars. In 1968 they moved the rear wheels back about 3"". It was these years that solidified the widowmaker reputation. Im on my phone, but you can tell the two apart via the hole for the torsion bar just behind the doors. The early cars hole was right up against the end of the fender,and the late cars had 3"" there. The trailing arms are different as well,which is the real difference,not just the extra wheelbase. It's been many years since I've thought about it but I believe the camber curves between are very different.  The 930 was introduced in 1976 and its brutal boost curve reaffirmed that widowmaker reputation."

carporn,3dv4gm,zkiller195,-1,Mon Jul 20 09:59:40 2015 UTC,"I doubt it was literally a blizzard. A blizzard is defined as having less than 1/4 mile visibility. At 120 mph, that's only 7.5 seconds. And you can't really make out objects at the threshold of visibility, especially when you have to process them at that speed. By the time you're close enough to actually see an object and make out what it is, you'd be looking at less than 5 seconds to react. Given the low traction environment and high speed, it would be incredibly stupid and almost certainly result in a crash at that speed."

carporn,3du4tk,TheDickTurd,25,Sun Jul 19 14:21:42 2015 UTC,"this is a WRX not a STI. couple things to note:   smaller scoop, the STI scoop was larger no brembos, the STI came stock with brembos, the WRX conventional calipers the wing is aftermarket and resembles something like a version 5 STI wing, not a OEM sti wing for that year"
carporn,3du4tk,Redslaya,5,Sun Jul 19 16:58:32 2015 UTC,One other thing I noticed is that it has a sunroof which the STI's shouldn't have.

carporn,3du4tk,joajan,2,Sun Jul 19 21:47:13 2015 UTC,A genuine STI can have foglights. I think the things that were being noted are clear details as to why it's a WRX that has some addons.
carporn,3du4tk,ChairmanDev,2,Sun Jul 19 21:58:07 2015 UTC,"Might be true in the US, in Sweden where I live every blob-STI where without fog lights. The only version I know which have them is the Petter Solberg Edition WR1."
carporn,3du4tk,joajan,2,Sun Jul 19 22:03:48 2015 UTC,You can install foglights. What's on there stock with the STI logo are foglight covers. People often replace the covers for foglights that look like this.   What I'm trying to say is that foglights are common on STI's and having one doesn't necessarily mean it's not a real one.

I'm kind of wondering if this is an sti because the scoop looks too small to be an sti scoop, and the brakes don't look like the brembos that come on the blobeye sti's. I can't imagine why you would change those either. Also those wheels are really close to the BBS wheels that came stock on those sti's, It seems unlikely someone would replace the BBS's for something so similar."

carporn,3du4tk,GTAdriver1988,7,Sun Jul 19 15:59:16 2015 UTC,"I mean the gold wheels are sort of traditional, the original sti and before that the impreza rally cars of the 90's all had the gold alloy wheels, and every launch edition STI since then comes factory with them. Also, loud exhausts are usually pretty functional in turbo cars. And too a point, a little lowering of a easily tuned car doesn't hurt performance as long as the driver doesn't have to solve a physics problem everytime he has to drive over a speed bump....or puts a stupid amount of camber on the wheels"
carporn,3du4tk,Unaidedgrain,3,Sun Jul 19 17:47:04 2015 UTC,"I live in western Washington and the reason they're so popular is because they're awd (we get a lot of rain), and they're one of the fastest easily modifiable cars you can get in the $10k ball park or even lower. The loud exhaust is actually functional. It's a turbo car so you want it to be as free flowing as possible. I have one that's everything you said except lowered. But there's lots that for your description too."

carporn,3dqmzk,rainy0days,2,Sat Jul 18 22:55:01 2015 UTC,There are a couple ways to tell but they're subtle unless you can tell off the bat that the 280 is a little bigger than the 240.
carporn,3dqmzk,DrunkleDick,3,Sat Jul 18 20:33:55 2015 UTC,"Sorry but, no they are not. The 280ZX is different but the 240,260, and 280z are identical cars, sheet metal wise. The differences come from the drivetrain, the bumpers, and the interior upgrades. And nearly every single piece from all 3 cars is interchangeable. Source; I have a 240z hood and 240z thin bumpers on my 280z. The only thing I needed to do was buy brackets for them to mount to. They fit perfectly.    EDIT: and tailights are different."
carporn,3dqmzk,Do_it_in_a_Datsun,3,Sat Jul 18 20:41:47 2015 UTC,"Sheet metal wise the 280Z is thicker and definitely not identical. The body is heavier and there are minor differences besides the bumpers. I also have 240Z bumpers for my 280Z with the brackets also.  Suspension wise there are a good deal of differences. I can spot early 240Z hatch glass from a mile away. There are differences that can be spotted, the cars are not identical like the guy above posted. Even the taillights like you mentioned as are the turn signals. There are a lot of little differences, which was my main point."
carporn,3dqmzk,DrunkleDick,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:01:05 2015 UTC,"The only places where the sheet metal is thicker is the lower rear valance and in the frame rails. But the car is not bigger like you state. The changes in the suspension where solely to the rear diff (upgraded to the R200) and the shocks/springs front and back, though, in stock form the car still felt softer.    As for the rear hatch, only a few years where different due to the vents they installed in the back. All other years either didnt have vents or where 260 or 280z cars. The vertical defroster no withstanding.   Aside from all the minor visual cues, they are identical cars."
carporn,3dqmzk,Do_it_in_a_Datsun,0,Sat Jul 18 21:23:22 2015 UTC,I'm busy so I won't link it but check out the point 2 inch difference on the wiki and the width. That's the difference I was referring to no one can see it.
carporn,3dqmzk,DrunkleDick,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:38:36 2015 UTC,"10"" with the 5mph bumpers."
carporn,3dqmzk,Do_it_in_a_Datsun,0,Sat Jul 18 21:53:09 2015 UTC,"That's the length. I've been under the impression that there's a tiny variance in width due to thicker metal. That's what I was referring to all along, just didn't have time to spell it out.   My original claim stands that taking the bumpers off doesn't make a 240 and 280 identical(from this view, you know what I mean) and you can tell that the pictured Z is a 280."
carporn,3dqmzk,DrunkleDick,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:16:51 2015 UTC,"The biggest drifference in the 240z and 280z are the tail lights and front valance , which is bigger on the 280z where the grill is lower than on a 240z"
carporn,3dqmzk,Peniswrinkleintime,0,Sat Jul 18 22:39:02 2015 UTC,"I don't think so, I think I said that based on the fact that I looked at 280s on Craigslist and none were in good shape. I also thought the rear end was a little longer on the 240 but after looking at them side by side I see it's not. I also may have just liked all the 240s I've seen better than 280s, the way they're modified or I really like the longnose (I think that's what it's called). Someone also mentioned the taillights are different but that wasn't what I was looking at."
carporn,3dqmzk,tigerevoke4,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:52:07 2015 UTC,"Aside from bumpers and badging, there is no difference between the two visually.     EDIT: and tailights are different."

Anyone who knows anything about driving/cars knows that.     Camber, regardless if I like how it looks or not (I don't) dramatically reduces the contact patch on each tire thus negatively affecting your cars performance.  Of course correctly applied camber is a very good thing, I'm talking about the extreme application of camber used for ascetic reasons.     Read this.     Keep your camber, it tells people how much you know about cars before you even open your mouth  Source: tons of track time / high performance driver education."

carporn,3drfe6,SkitTrick,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:42:58 2015 UTC,"I drove one of these for 16 years. Got it used in only OK shape and it was my daily driver for about 10 of those years. Never left me stranded and the motor never was apart in that time. I did brakes a few times, a few sets of tires, a clutch or two, and the only thing unexpected was I had to do transmission bearings and a few bushings here and there. That's over about 160,000 miles. The guy that bought it from me with about 220,000 on it was planning on restoring it. It still ran and drove fine. I'd never hesitate to recommend these as a really usable sport car.

The automatics I drove, on the other hand, were fairly doggish. It was just a fun car, but no speedball these days. There are lots of ways these days to give it more power.

carporn,3d8xym,Mad1723,4,Tue Jul 14 22:31:56 2015 UTC,I personally agree completely. If they put the sti engine in it it would be a crazy fun car. But I have heard from people that have driven it that say it's got just the right amount of power to have 1k smiles per gallon.

carporn,3d8xym,BlackMacGyver,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:05:06 2015 UTC,"That is not really correct.   Going off of Google specs the 2015 mazda miata has 158 to 167 horse power (I assume at the crank), and it weighs 2,480 to 2,619 pounds. Going off of the average weight and power the miata has 1 horsepower to every 15.6 pounds of car.   The brz has 200 horsepower (99% sure this is at the crank this time), and weighs from 2,764 to 2,824 lbs. Using the average weight the brz has 13.9 pounds per 1 horsepower.   The wrx has 12.1 pounds per 1 horsepower and the sti has 11.3. The koenegsegg one:1 has 1 kg to 1 horsepower(i just really like that car).  And hp to weight isn't even close to what makes a fun car fun. Balance, suspension, gearing, and other factors are what make a car fun.  [edit]  Koenegsegg doesn't use freedom units."

The theory was that they were so far over 280 hp that they were trying to bring it down (iirc, there was some fudging- dynos at the wheels showed that the FD/R34/Supra were either equipped with unbelievably effiicient drivetrains...or they were closer to 300hp at the crank)."

I'm not too sure about the r32 gtr's, but the r35's are only meant to be driven 2500-3000 miles a YEAR. Built motors in general are not meant to be daily drivers.   You can daily a car with a fmic, intake, exhaust etc, but once you start getting into built internals then it should be only taken out every so often. Granted when you do take it out, it should be beat on because that's what they're made for.

There are also a lot of vintage cars that have the wheel wells squared off or the wheels slightly tucked, which I personally like when done well, too.  An example of a fair amount of tuck: http://41.media.tumblr.com/a535489307b31f5288a0dc3dd45c178f/tumblr_nmxrzv1fyd1r5zt4fo1_1280.jpg  And a fully covered wheel well: http://40.media.tumblr.com/064f78bbb77e143df25735ffa4ae4712/tumblr_ndvj1ju6n61r5zt4fo1_1280.jpg  Gullwings are kind of a combination of all of those traits: http://36.media.tumblr.com/70391c3805500f491cde465a05f2d882/tumblr_n9rk9nmYtM1r5zt4fo1_1280.jpg"

carporn,3d7pw8,Unaidedgrain,2,Tue Jul 14 20:34:34 2015 UTC,"I'd consider the P2 as more of a technical showcase rather than a prototype, since they never really had any intention to put it into production.

carporn,3d7pw8,Unaidedgrain,3,Tue Jul 14 20:35:00 2015 UTC,"I mentioned this elsewhere, but after being REALLY REALLY disappointed in the look of the 818, the coupe looks really nice (nice enough that I'm reconsidering building one). It looks like they've redesigned the front-end slightly as well.   For those interested, the coupe is $13k + WRX donor."
carporn,3d7pw8,DrieStone,-1,Tue Jul 14 12:56:27 2015 UTC,"So like $45k+? not bad, still could probably get something faster but not as unique."
carporn,3d7pw8,Virtualras,3,Tue Jul 14 16:04:56 2015 UTC,"Someone said the wrx donor could be 2002-2007, so a solid 2002 wrx is probably about $10k, so you could have one for like $25k."
carporn,3d7pw8,tigerevoke4,3,Tue Jul 14 16:11:08 2015 UTC,"You don't need a lot from the Impreza (drivetrain and some suspension). If you didn't want a WRX, you could probably find something really cheap.  The 818 doesn't (necessarily) need paint either. The idea was that you could build the car, bare-bones for $15k including donor.  Obviously the coupe increases that price $3k, but gets you a hard top, power windows, etc. Most people put a massaged (or rebuilt) engine in the car too, although at that weight you don't need a lot of power to have fun.  My original disappointment was that FFR was suggesting a modern, mid-engined car that was inspired by something like the Lancia Stratos (my favorite car of all time). I'm also an avid Lotus fan, and thought that perhaps the 818 would be a more worthwhile investment over something like an Elise or Exige. When they finally announced the 818 it was not pretty, and looked nothing like the Stratos. With the redesigned front-end and the new hard top, I start to see some similarity with the Exige, and my interest went from about 0% to 80%."

So you could pick up a salvage wrx and build one of these with rebuilt and tuned motor and upgraded parts for under 25k easy."

carporn,3d4p7c,Leo_Kru,9,Mon Jul 13 21:52:41 2015 UTC,"so a lot of the older cars were not built anywhere near the safety standards we see today, one because safety standards were not what they are today, but also the technology wasnt there or even nesc due to lower speeds.  If you crash a 2015 mustang head on into a 1968 mustang say at 35 mph each, there's a strong possibility the 1968 driver and passengers wont walk away while the 2015 driver and passengers will certainly.   This is why a lot of guys will ""Pro tour"" their car, essentially they add steel or aluminum tubing to the car to strengthen it. Similar to what you see a naked nascar like.   Theres some pretty crazy videos of old cars in crash tests that reveal just this.  For me (since im not into collecting a car for monetary gain, i would prefer to have the car for its looks, while under the skin have it be safe."

carporn,3d4p7c,Leo_Kru,2,Tue Jul 14 01:29:46 2015 UTC,"yup, harnesses will fuck you up too. if anyone is concerned about safety in an old car, throw some 3-point belts in it and that's about the most you can do. it'll be safe though... it's not like cars even had standard airbags until like, 1990.  EDIT: down votes, really? roll cages and harnesses are not designed to protect you in most street collisions. if you're not wearing a helmet, you're gonna bash your head against the roll bar, and if you're running a harness you need a six point, or you're submarining."
carporn,3d4p7c,imeatingpancakes,2,Tue Jul 14 01:34:25 2015 UTC,you can put in working beaks and radial tires as well.
carporn,3d4p7c,minizanz,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:11:10 2015 UTC,"Right? it isnt an opinion you can downvote, these are facts. No airbag? Solve that with a racing harness. But a harness in a rollover means youre held upright and your head is crushed instead of the 3 point belt letting you move to the side. Solve that with a rollcage. Well, a rollcage means a steel beam right next to your head for you to crack it open on in even minor collisions. Its either harness and cage, or airbag and 3 point belt. Street safety and track safety do not mix."

They're okay and I wouldn't mind having one, but stock doesn't do it for me like a nicely resto-modded Camaro. Tastefully done, of course.   Unfortunately for you Camaros demand a nice premium. Everyone loves the Chevelle, too. I went with a Buick Skylark, got it cheap, dropped a Buick 455 in it and more or less have a nicely restored classic and have maybe $13 into it all said and done. It'll never be done but it's far cheaper than a Chevelle would've cost me :)   Lots of great cars out there. I imagine trying to find a big block to throw into that Type 65.

You still need to supply the engine, body work, paint, etc. But for $20k, you could more or less having a working car except engine.   A lot of work goes into them though, it literally comes in parts so a lot of the price you see there is assembly and likely custom interior, paint work, body work, and a number of other tiny details that add up. Getting a proper engine for it is gonna cost a small fortune as well. You could just as easily drop a 302 or something in if you wanted but personally I'd want a big block to rival the original."

carporn,3d4xp4,skian,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:17:02 2015 UTC,This car fills me with deep hatred of BMW every time I see it has more than 2 doors. Every gran coupe they do does.
carporn,3d4xp4,Unicoasterglass,3,Mon Jul 13 17:48:46 2015 UTC,Why do people hate on 4 doors? Serious question. I understand that faster more hp cars have generally always had 2 doors. But I think the m5 and m6 gran coupe looks amazing because of the 4 doors. Something about the practicality of 4 doors makes them look much better to me.

The hate has to do with the fact that BMW talked about reviewing their naming system, so that even numbers (2, 4, 6-series) had 2 doors. While odd numbers (3, 5, 7-series) would have 4 doors. Then they turned around and released the 4 and 6-series gran coupe, which have 4 doors, despite their names."

Admittedly, the sloped front with the squinted headlights, despite not looking very Aston Martin-y to me, does look pretty cool. But I don't think the rest of the car works well with it. Perhaps because of the hood vents"
carporn,3d16vh,Modeno,2,Sun Jul 12 22:09:08 2015 UTC,There was a good discussion on Jay Leno's Garage about hood vents in a hand built car. Excalibur RS started out with a beautiful hood but heat issues created the awful hood vents out of necessity
carporn,3d16vh,alienjin,3,Sun Jul 12 22:19:15 2015 UTC,"Oh completely believable. The thing I have with it though, is that the the vents themselves aren't inherently awful; they just don't work for me on this car. And it's one thing for a one man designer to be limited in what they can do about the vents. But Aston Martin I imagine would find a way to make it all work together"

If you have heard of it, start adhering to it. Also unless it's a closeup, get the whole car in there, you have a lot of them getting cut off where we see maybe 90% of the car, which can be frustrating.

carporn,3d1t1o,Cman1200,2,Mon Jul 13 00:14:10 2015 UTC,"Some tips I've learned:  Avoid taking pictures where there is a persons shadow on the car.  Wait for people to leave or walk to the other side.  Avoid showing multiple pictures of one car from the same spot.  Pick the best one from that angle.  When shooting in the early morning, use a faster shutter speed to bring some of the color back.  Otherwise the sky is too bright and messes with the color of the car.  If shooting the dark/shaded side of a car, up the ISO a notch to bring the details back."
carporn,3d1t1o,munky9002,4,Mon Jul 13 14:51:06 2015 UTC,"I agree with everything pileofdeadninjas said.

carporn,3cx13q,Darren_Martin,38,Sat Jul 11 15:37:04 2015 UTC,"Here's what I think,  it'll have a rotary engine,  but it won't power the drive line.  Instead,  the rotary will act as a generator that will power electric motors.  The rotary has a troubled torque band where as the electric motors have huge, flat torque bands.    The rotary engine is used to do the same type of generator work in drones.  It's small,  light weight,  and can turn alternators are high speeds when needed."
carporn,3cx13q,PissedOnMyLeg,8,Sat Jul 11 16:21:57 2015 UTC,I thought Mazda is ditching the rotary entirely?
carporn,3cx13q,thelethalpotato,11,Sat Jul 11 17:56:36 2015 UTC,Well supposedly they're bringing back the rx7 and rx8 and those have always been rotaries.

carporn,3cx13q,CommanderVinegar,4,Sat Jul 11 19:42:44 2015 UTC,"Their reliability has been kinda plagued by owners not maintaining their vehicles, heavily modifying them, or not having them worked on by competent mechanics. Not everyone knows how to work on a rotary"
carporn,3cx13q,caffeineTX,0,Sun Jul 12 01:43:50 2015 UTC,But isnt it also true that rotaries work best in higher revs which makes them great for racing bur shitty in stop and go city driving?
carporn,3cx13q,breathingsharks,1 point,Sun Jul 12 05:32:14 2015 UTC,"not really, the power band is just higher up in the revs."
carporn,3cx13q,caffeineTX,1 point,Sun Jul 12 05:54:07 2015 UTC,"What he's saying is that it's incredibly important to rev rotors to redline regularly to de-coke the engine. Its terrible to baby rotaries and drive them around like a grandma. That was one of the major downfalls of the rx8, it was sold as an everymans sportscar but 90% of owners didnt know that they had to rev the tits off them regularly and now lots of them are expensive paperweights."
carporn,3cx13q,kidneyshifter,0,Sun Jul 12 07:54:27 2015 UTC,But using it as a generator would still be less efficient in a hybrid system than a piston engine in a similar hybrid system.  It's just the nature of the rotary engine.

I've seen him around a handful of times, and he just parks it amongst the rest of the lot, not off in a corner somewhere. Clearly, it's just a fun DD for him, as it has the typical bugs, dirt, brake dust, etc that cars have.  I agree with his use. Some cars, sure, keep them clean and pristine for show use. But, the 4 Liter will probably go down in history as one of the best driving 911s ever. It would be a shame to miss out on that."

Also, '69s sometimes have fins in the rear fender just ahead of the rear wheel, and IIRC that actually wasn't implemented until halfway into production, which some call a '69-and-a-half."

carporn,3csryv,Quagman,9,Fri Jul 10 18:55:57 2015 UTC,Lol I know it's turbo'd so mufflers are halfway redundant but those are some hilariously half-assed mufflers.
carporn,3csryv,kerrigan7782,4,Fri Jul 10 17:44:38 2015 UTC,Seems more likely that they're catalytic converters.  Those are legally required in a lot of places.
carporn,3csryv,Dattosan,7,Fri Jul 10 19:34:34 2015 UTC,It does seem likely but they look slightly odd for cats (the sharp angles at the sides aren't common in cats but are very common in mufflers) and I'm not seeing the generally also required rear o2 sensors.
carporn,3csryv,kerrigan7782,5,Fri Jul 10 21:34:28 2015 UTC,"Well, you're not wrong. I actually looked up different kinds of cats to see if I could find some like that. Admittedly, I didn't try very hard, but I couldn't find any looking just like what's seen in the pic."
carporn,3csryv,Dattosan,2,Fri Jul 10 22:29:15 2015 UTC,"those are just small but effective mufflers, you don't need a big muffler since the turbo's cut away at a lot of the noise, and you still want it to sound good."
carporn,3csryv,flyingliz45,1 point,Sat Jul 11 03:08:23 2015 UTC,How so? They look like they are a set of burns mufflers which are used on everything from ALMS racecars to 2300hp Gallardos.

carporn,3copn2,nerfdude,-17,Fri Jul 10 08:19:49 2015 UTC,"The Acura NSX is the greatest sports car ever made.  I can’t wait to buy one even though I am only 16 and have no money. I will just have to wait until I am fresh out of college at my $100K per year job to buy one.  I only wish I could get one now, I found a 1993 year model with 160,000 miles going for $45K. That is awesome, Hondas are so great that they always keep their resale value. You also know there is nothing wrong with it too, it is dead reliable, even at 22 years old. Why you ask? You see that A on the hood? That’s right it’s a Honda, Honda means reliability, the TV has been telling me that for years, and it’s true.  Honda did the right thing by choosing to hand build the NSX. Humans are so much better and more accurate at doing menial repetitive motions than robots. There were also no additional costs associated with hand building the NSX, Honda was smart and used other Honda parts in the NSX. See that stereo system and speakers? They are also in the Civic, see those window switches, HUD dials, temp/fan controls too? You can get the same ones in a Civic. Even the engine and transmission are the same ones in the V6 Accord but with slight modifications. The truth is Honda made the NSX expensive because it wanted it to be taken seriously as a super car. All other super cars are expensive, why shouldn’t Honda’s be also?  The NSX also has high HP per liter. That is awesome, that means the NSX goes really fast. The higher a car’s HP per liter, the faster it goes. Your cars with their turbo chargers and superchargers are just jealous that a N/A engine makes more HP per liter than your car and is faster because of it.  It also has a VTEC engine, the single greatest engine related invention. Only Honda makes VTEC engines, no other manufacturer does. Someone once said to me “LOL Double-Vanos” and “WTF VVT-i”. I said “WTF” back, because that is not VTEC, I don’t even know what those are. Honda invented VTEC and only Honda is awesome enough to have VTEC stickers on the bodies of their VTEC equipped cars, no other manufacturer puts stickers on their cars, that because they don’t make VTEC cars.  Someone also said that you could get better performance from a C5 Corvette and it costs half the NSX. Whatever, it is cheaper but not as fast, the Corvette doesn’t get nearly the NSX’s HP per litre. The Corvette also weighs 5000lbs and can’t handle turns. It also isn’t as unique as the NSX. Uniqueness is an essential factor when deciding on a car, Acura owners pay top dollar for exclusivity, that’s how you know it is a true super car up there with Ferraris because you also see few of them on the road too.  I know Honda has discontinued the NSX’s production, but I don’t know why, it such a great car. Some people tell me it was discontinued because it wasn’t selling very well. If people saw the genius in the NSX as I did, it would be sold out every year.  But Honda knew that the late 1980’s style would make a comeback, which is why they didn’t update the NSX’s interior from when they first designed it. They were ahead of the trend. That’s Honda for you, always thinking ahead.  The Acura NSX is the greatest sports car ever made and you know it. If you still don’t understand why then I can’t explain it to. Maybe if you own a 1992 Civic DX automatic like me you would understand why Hondas are the best and the NSX is the greatest."

A total of six 910s were entered in that race, three with the 8-cylinder engines and three with 2.0 liter flat-6s. The 6-cylinder cars proved to be more reliable and won the race 1-2-3, with 2 8 cylinder cars retiring, and the last one coming in 4th. Stunning cars, these.

carporn,3cfwkk,bacon8,1 point,Tue Jul 7 23:25:00 2015 UTC,"No I'm not. I'm just pointing out that the Volvo is AWD which the old Focus RS isn't, therefore I don't consider it different versions of the same car. I know they share a lot, but different drivetrain is a significant difference."

carporn,3cfwkk,biscuitpie,17,Tue Jul 7 18:14:20 2015 UTC,that's just weird that there is a Ford that was not on sale in USA
carporn,3cfwkk,devildog25,14,Tue Jul 7 19:24:36 2015 UTC,Ford Europe and Ford USA are run as 2 separate companies and have been for decades.  It was decided that Ford would have to alter their cars to compete in the European market.  Same goes for GM and Opel/Vauxhall.
carporn,3cfwkk,pabst_blaster,4,Tue Jul 7 20:25:05 2015 UTC,"Although with the Ford One program, those differences have been greatly reduced. IIRC the focus ST was essentially the halo car for the beginning of the program.

carporn,3cfwkk,CloudTheWolf,10,Tue Jul 7 18:17:12 2015 UTC,Compare this pic of the upcoming car with OP's picture. To me the two things that jump out immediately are that the headlights are very different and it's missing the aggressive wheel arches.
carporn,3cfwkk,acog,8,Tue Jul 7 19:14:07 2015 UTC,"The older version seemed more rally/race styling, the new one is more of a sporty looking family hatch. I am from the UK and have a friend with the older one, goes like shit off a shovel!"

carporn,3cfwkk,Intensive__Purposes,-1,Tue Jul 7 20:23:50 2015 UTC,"If they decide to bring the new RS to the states it will probably be somewhere near 30-38k, maybe 40k if they decide to do some type of special trim launch edition."
carporn,3cfwkk,pabst_blaster,8,Tue Jul 7 19:24:14 2015 UTC,I think it has already been decided that the new one will be sold here.
carporn,3cfwkk,RonMFCadillac,4,Tue Jul 7 19:28:24 2015 UTC,My price estimate stands.  It will be a direct market competitor to the STI and GTI.
carporn,3cfwkk,ABillyGoat,4,Tue Jul 7 19:36:00 2015 UTC,The RS is far and away better than the GTI. Even the STI will be behind. The GTI and STI don't even compete. I'd say GTI/WRX (non STI)/Focus ST currently are direct competitors.   GTI stock bhp: 210 Focus ST stock bhp: 255 WRX STI stock bhp: 305 2016 Focus RS stock bhp: 355
carporn,3cfwkk,TipyUK,7,Tue Jul 7 19:41:54 2015 UTC,I meant Golf R previously.  I am not saying that one has more ponies than another.  What I was saying is that is where it falls in the market break down.
carporn,3cfwkk,NahNotOnReddit,2,Tue Jul 7 21:03:59 2015 UTC,Ya golf R would continue compete in the super hot hatch category with STI and the RS.  I like the 2dr look of the Golf R and prior model RS.
carporn,3cfwkk,ABillyGoat,1 point,Wed Jul 8 00:20:25 2015 UTC,Is the RS going to be sold as an AWD in the US?
carporn,3cfwkk,Alkivar,2,Wed Jul 8 00:00:40 2015 UTC,Yup. It'd have to be either AWD or RWD with the amount of power it has. I drive the ST now and even at just 255hp the oversteer can be a lot to handle at speed in corners.
carporn,3cfwkk,oxygenburn,1 point,Wed Jul 8 00:22:23 2015 UTC,Yes. The US version will be nearly identical
carporn,3cfwkk,Relaxedmass,2,Wed Jul 8 00:26:52 2015 UTC,Probably more Golf R than GTI if they still make them.

Both of which will almost certainly appreciate in value (eventually) or at least hold value. A replica will not likely even break even on investment if sold.   I'm just saying, I would have no problem having a p4 replica with an ls, or more likely, a full ford gt drivetrain, with reliability and affordability so I wouldn't be afraid to actually use it."

carporn,3c7ejh,Wrx09,4,Mon Jul 6 00:21:04 2015 UTC,"Correct me if I'm wrong, but Carroll Shelby never designed the GT40 or the GT. I believe the soul of the car is still alive and well inside the new Ford GT, sure it doesn't boast a big American V8 but Le Mans is were the GT40 made its name. This new GT is entering Le Mans 24 hour race and continuing the legacy its older brothers started. You can still see the design of the GT40 in parts of the newer GT as well. I see it as a younger brother, same parents but a different person."
carporn,3c7ejh,bothnorman,5,Mon Jul 6 02:33:14 2015 UTC,"That's actually a good way to think of it, but Shelby did have a lot of influence in the car, this is a wiki snip it "" Racing historyEdit  The Ford GT40 was first raced in May 1964 at the Nürburgring 1000 km race where it retired with suspension failure after holding second place early in the event. Three weeks later at the 24 Hours of Le Mans, all three entries retired although the Ginther/Gregory car led the field from the second lap until its first pitstop. After a season-long series of dismal results under John Wyer in 1964, the program was handed over to Carroll Shelby after the 1964 Nassau race. The cars were sent directly to Shelby, still bearing the dirt and damage from the Nassau race. Carroll Shelby was noted for complaining that the cars were poorly maintained when he received them, but later information revealed the cars were packed up as soon as the race was over, and FAV never had a chance to clean, and organize the cars to be transported to Shelby"""

Just let designers go wild and not be constrained to what the consumer necessarily wants but rather a car to rival the Italians and Germans. Essentially get a group of their top guys together to have 'fun' and build their dream car, I know they can do it. The Marketing/PR Director for Honda North America had a boat on my dock and he would drive the most awesome concept cars or the only new production car in the States down to the boats and hand me the keys to them occasionally. I got to drive the first Honda S2000, Element, and others but the very best was a super charged NSX one-off that was like nothing else I have ever driven.  They had their top guys go nuts on this concept and not only fast it had a skirt kit that looked factory. Didn't mean to ramble on"

carporn,3c4l31,trancematzl15,9,Sat Jul 4 22:19:19 2015 UTC,I had no idea that the vehicle inspections in Germany are so arduous.  Most vehicle inspections elsewhere in the world are a complete joke and are generally about paying taxes for the privilege of owning a thing having wheels.
carporn,3c4l31,CutlassSupremo,7,Sat Jul 4 22:53:51 2015 UTC,"yes they're extremely strict when it's about inspections, it's a two sided coin to be true. One the one side it's awesome because cars are kept in good condition which is a must when you're driving on the Autobahn. It would be fatal if something falls off while people besides you are driving 130mph.  On the other side it's obviously a pain in the ass to modify your car. Everything you like to mod needs a certificate which says this item has been tested and is stable/ good enough for especially your car model. it makes modifying your car very expensive since the inspections cost a hell lot of money."

Good luck breaking even with 40 years worth of Ferrari/Maserati services in the logbook ,which would be required to generate any value in the car at all.   I like Maserati, but any models from the last few decades drop by at least 60% value within the first year and once the depreciation plateaus after a couple of years they sit at the same value as a comparable BMW (at best) forever after.  There's a big difference between between a classic Maserati and a new Maserati with 40 years on it. Then again, only time will tell - maybe you're some sort of savant."

carporn,3c5io4,IN-B4-404,3,Sun Jul 5 00:46:00 2015 UTC,"It's a lot of fun to drive, very aggressive acceleration as well as looks. In my opinion the XJ is the best looking sedan in its price range but it does have some downsides, one of the biggest being its size. The standard wheelbase model is fine on the road but when you get into a parking lot you really notice the cars size, it also doesn't help that you absolutely need the rear camera to see out the back when parking. My biggest gripe with the car is its sluggish screen, each button press has around a 1 second delay and worst of all is when you put the car in reverse it can take almost 10 seconds for the rear camera to come on but I hear it's a problem the 2014 and up models don't have. Still even with its setbacks its an incredibly cool car, had it over a year and I still smile when I see it."
carporn,3c5io4,zippy225,5,Sun Jul 5 01:41:52 2015 UTC,"My favorite luxury sedan by far, the competitors really do not stand out as much side by side. Every where I look, I see s550's or 750li's. Rarely do I see XJ's. Mercedes and bmw are better known to most, so mainly people buy them as status symbols. Jaguars on the other, I think one buys them because he feels a connection with the beautiful design and performance that comes along, also modern jaguars are the best sounding cars.   Jaguar has really stepped its game up and it absolutely shows. those ""good to be bad"" commercials are  genius. For such a heavy car it really moves....enjoy the heck out of it and then get the XFR-S and own the streets."

There were very few 427 Cobra S/C models made -- those were the only ones that were street legal.

If you disagree, take it up with the moderators and ask them to establish stricter rules for submissions."

carporn,3bzfbu,blazefalcon,25,Sat Jul 4 15:28:14 2015 UTC,Please tell me they'll finish the car and make a damn rear bumper cover
carporn,3bzfbu,Lorbe_Wabo,40,Fri Jul 3 12:18:44 2015 UTC,The only thing a rear bumper does on a drift car is get damaged... it's common to not run one.
carporn,3bzfbu,blazefalcon,12,Fri Jul 3 15:35:42 2015 UTC,Why not just remove it for drifting then? I see plenty of 240s around with quick-release bumpers
carporn,3bzfbu,rainy0days,1 point,Fri Jul 3 15:52:28 2015 UTC,Because they're not necessary if you're not using it as a street car?
carporn,3bzfbu,blazefalcon,9,Fri Jul 3 18:02:43 2015 UTC,"Why would you put a total cosmetic overhaul $4k+ bodykit on a car essentially meant to be damaged, then?"
carporn,3bzfbu,rainy0days,3,Fri Jul 3 23:12:04 2015 UTC,Because drifting is all about style.
carporn,3bzfbu,blazefalcon,10,Fri Jul 3 23:18:40 2015 UTC,"... So they don't finish the style? Not trying to be a dick, I just don't fucking get it"
carporn,3bzfbu,rainy0days,5,Fri Jul 3 23:50:56 2015 UTC,"The absence of the bumper is part of the car's style. Look at some of Miura's other cars and you will see it's a common theme.   It may not be a style you or many others like, but it is a style that he chose."
carporn,3bzfbu,aresev6,2,Fri Jul 3 23:57:21 2015 UTC,"It's uncommon for a well maintained drift car to be missing panels with the exception of the front bumper, removing that is functional because it allows more airflow over large aftermarket FMIC's and oil coolers. Even drift slags get a quick cheap and ugly repair after an accident. The reason that the car OP posted doesn't have a rear bumper is because it had to be removed to fit brackets for the pointless rear diffuser. However, the forced rat look has became common and I think that we may see more missing panels in the future"
carporn,3bzfbu,Mmer03,1 point,Sat Jul 4 01:28:32 2015 UTC,Looks like there is still holes and space for a bumper
carporn,3bzfbu,Anach,-6,Sat Jul 4 01:46:55 2015 UTC,"Because part of that styles is cars that look unfinished? I don't get it either, but you should see some of the ricers driving around here with mismatched body panels and bits hanging off them."
carporn,3bzfbu,FARTBOX_DESTROYER,3,Sat Jul 4 14:10:57 2015 UTC,"This entire car is modified unnecessarily. The whole front end replacement is unnecessary. The insanely awesome paint job is unnecessary. The fancy wheels are unnecesary.

carporn,3bzfbu,rainy0days,4,Sat Jul 4 00:29:48 2015 UTC,"The point is not having the rear bumper is part of the car's style. If it's not on the street, then there's no legal reason to have one either.   Edit: Downvotes for style opinions? What is this, r/shittycarmods? I thought this sub was above that."
carporn,3bzfbu,FARTBOX_DESTROYER,2,Sat Jul 4 01:01:00 2015 UTC,"Should have just said that! The original answer made some sort of practical argument. I guess most people, such as myself, didn't realize that leaving off the rear bumper cover was a style."
carporn,3bzfbu,Tohafat,11,Sat Jul 4 01:27:06 2015 UTC,Nope. They usually leave it off now if they install a diffuser.
carporn,3bzfbu,blazefalcon,4,Sat Jul 4 03:03:49 2015 UTC,"That's a shame. It looks broken and unfinished. I know, drift, save weight, but hopefully there'll be an option."

carporn,3bzfbu,Mankyspoon,11,Sat Jul 4 02:01:12 2015 UTC,"Not that it makes a difference, but that is an oil cooler, not an intercooler."
carporn,3bzfbu,megalurkeruygcxrtgbn,3,Fri Jul 3 13:32:46 2015 UTC,"And exposed oil coolers are kind of a drift thing. Actually, they might be common elsewhere in car culture but  I only really see it in the drift scene."
carporn,3bzfbu,rainy0days,6,Fri Jul 3 14:02:17 2015 UTC,"Put the word bosozoku into google images and you'll see a lot of externally mounted oil coolers, among other things."
carporn,3bzfbu,asad137,3,Fri Jul 3 14:13:08 2015 UTC,"Haha, I guess I've always just considered bosozoku to be part of it. Really, the drift scene (at least in the US) is just influenced pretty heavily by that stuff."

carporn,3bzfbu,Tbird555,1 point,Fri Jul 3 23:38:37 2015 UTC,Is the benefit just increased airflow?
carporn,3bzfbu,megalurkeruygcxrtgbn,2,Fri Jul 3 23:52:08 2015 UTC,"I don't know if there even is a benefit. Like, sure, exposed intercooler means colder coils when you're vrooming, but idk how much that would affect an oil cooler, if at all."
carporn,3bzfbu,MrPhatBob,7,Fri Jul 3 14:30:16 2015 UTC,Pretty sure the trend started because of limited engine bay space.
carporn,3bzfbu,sobedog,1 point,Fri Jul 3 14:34:10 2015 UTC,I'm also certain this was the reason for it.
carporn,3bzfbu,sainisaab,1 point,Fri Jul 3 14:38:19 2015 UTC,"I think its a nod to the aesthetic of bosozoku, and also because, like everything Rocket Bunny do - it looks fucking cool."

Most likely a post-effect, but it's nicely done anyhow."
carporn,3bz8sj,LenientWhale,10,Fri Jul 3 16:37:10 2015 UTC,This effect is achieved with a low aperture telephoto lens and a composite of probably 50 or so pictures where you focus on the car and then just keep that focal point for every other shot you take.  It is called the Brenizer Method...

carporn,3bye02,tpwalsh,9,Fri Jul 3 08:03:38 2015 UTC,"It's not the rear engined portion that's really bad. It's the rear suspension design. If you lift in a corner you're libal to spin it because as the rear end gets light (normal) and the contact patch gets very small due to the semi trailing arm design.(not normal). The rear engine makes it worse because once it starts spinning,its very tough to stop. Combined with a turbo that can spool up unexpectedly to power levels that hadn't been seen before in a production sports car, makes for a lethal combination."

carporn,3bvrk1,jinkazetsukai,26,Thu Jul 2 22:06:43 2015 UTC,As always I really like the lines but I hate the headlights/grill combo.  I don't think I'll like another mustang better than the 2012 boss.
carporn,3bvrk1,DrCoquenbols,12,Thu Jul 2 19:38:15 2015 UTC,"As always I really like the lines but I hate the headlights/grill combo   I felt the same way, but it really grew on me after a little while."
carporn,3bvrk1,DrCoquenbols,4,Thu Jul 2 20:29:14 2015 UTC,"It just sort of looks like they split the difference between the 04 and 05 model years with the new one, but they made it less muscly and more sedan-y.  I have an 04 and I really like the styling even though I hated it at first, but I think they lost a lot of the charm with the new one.  Mustangs are supposed to look sort of ugly and aggressive, and this one just looks like they tried to make it look more like a normal car."

carporn,3bvrk1,BlindTreeFrog,2,Fri Jul 3 06:08:35 2015 UTC,"The lights are growing on me, but my favorite looking mustangs look ""chunky"" (for lack of a better term) so the current model looks too smooth."
carporn,3bvrk1,DrCoquenbols,1 point,Thu Jul 2 23:31:10 2015 UTC,It just looks like it's devoid of mustang styling aside from the rear lights.  Its like they took a 2012 mustang and slapped on the front of a 2015 camry.

carporn,3bvrk1,GunsMcBadass,6,Thu Jul 2 17:28:31 2015 UTC,"I drove a 427R a little while ago, and while I love Mustangs in general, it was just too much for the street. It seemed like the traction control wasn't fast enough to keep the back end from braking loose, then was too aggressive on recovery, causing the car to lurch badly.  The one I drove needed some attention to the suspension though, and would take a wicked step to the left when the tires broke loose. The rear rode like a Conestoga wagon, and made about as much noise.  I'd like to drive a newer one with a good alignment."
carporn,3bvrk1,Aurailious,6,Thu Jul 2 16:51:05 2015 UTC,"The chassis & suspension on the 2015 mustang have come a long way, and so have the electronics. We didn't experience any of that, but we also weren't exactly pushing the limits. Either way, the 427R and this new Stage 3 are pretty fun cars."

carporn,3bvrk1,jamesbn,3,Thu Jul 2 19:01:48 2015 UTC,"Good question, couldn't find any info on that. General rule is 15% difference, so probably ~570hp."
carporn,3bvrk1,jamesbn,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:12:51 2015 UTC,how do you know whether they used a chassis dyno or an engine dyno?  those numbers could just as easily be measured at the wheels.
carporn,3bvrk1,Entouchable,1 point,Fri Jul 3 04:18:37 2015 UTC,"I agree it could have been done, but odds are highly against. All auto companies when trying to impress, they use the highest number because many people hear the big number and go OOOooooo rather than asking if that's at the wheels.  Example.. Hellcat.. they didn't advertise or make a big deal over 675hp.. they made an issue over 707.  Again, you may be right, I just think they would have naturally marketed with the higher number."
carporn,3bvrk1,gwaly,1 point,Fri Jul 3 04:56:41 2015 UTC,Hellcats put 675 to the wheels? I would've expected a bit less if it's 707 at the crank.
carporn,3bvrk1,mastaswipes,2,Fri Jul 3 14:59:59 2015 UTC,"707 is a marketing number, if you watch any of the dynos on you tube, almost everyone agrees the car creates more than 707."
carporn,3bvrk1,ZeGermanCoastGuard,1 point,Fri Jul 3 20:19:35 2015 UTC,"Huh. That's weird, I guess 707 is kind of a nice number but why not the actual power if it's more? Especially on the charger since they set a record for the most powerful production sedan."
carporn,3bvrk1,Arkapella,2,Fri Jul 3 20:26:05 2015 UTC,"they were aiming for 707 from the start, the engineers were told to hit that mark. they ended up going over it a little, but promo/press/printings etc were already created.  don't take my word for it, check the dyno's out there... normally there is a 15-20% loss in hp numbers, if the HC had that, it would be far lower than all the dyno's are showing it to be.  Another cool thing about the HC engine.. it redlines at 6200 rpm and at this point if you check the dyno's again, at 6200rpm, the hp is still climbing strong.   Where as with other cars (gt500, zL1 as two examples) when they redline, their hp curve is almost flat as in, the guys had gotten everything possible out of those engines.  The HC engine has a lot of room yet. Expand the redline and gain more hp.   this car is a muscle car tuners dream ride"
carporn,3bvrk1,chevyfried,2,Sat Jul 4 00:07:00 2015 UTC,"good article here pointing the HC had 825 hp area but this is not official so who knows what the actual real number is.  if you look at typical drivetrain loss though, a 707 hp car would not have 600+ whp and every dyno I have seen for the HC has been 610-675 whp stock.   http://blog.caranddriver.com/2015-dodge-challenger-hellcat-fuel-economy-released-report-says-chrysler-dynod-car-at-825-hp/"

carporn,3bvhec,freaksavior,4,Thu Jul 2 20:04:55 2015 UTC,Can't tell if this is a joke. However if this is serious are you kidding me?!? the movie claimed bulletproof glass and that is extremely heavy even without FF added information. Even without the bulletproof glass the car weighs 3000lbs. And even with a 60/40 weight distribution (being generous) he would still have to deadlift over a 1000 lbs. Maybe a world record strongman could do it but even then there is nowhere in the front of the car to be a bar form to be gripped properly. All that being said ignore everything if I missed the joke.
carporn,3bvhec,zZzDKzZz,4,Fri Jul 3 03:33:58 2015 UTC,"Because of the lever, wouldn't it be closer to 500 pounds? I DL 400 and I'm not exactly a big dude, so I wouldn't be shocked if he can DL 500."

But I couldn't pull the trigger even though the dealer offered me an extra $5k on my trade. If it is a weekend car, I agree with you wholeheartedly, but as a daily driver it's embarrassingly, frustratingly slow. I was struggling to pass cars on a 45mph side street. Not what I want to deal with on a 40min commute in traffic every day. My GF's Jetta 2.5 is more capable in traffic, and for the nearly  ~$30k MSRP you can get some cars with proper torque. My fully-loaded CPO 135i was around the same price and it feels even better to drive, even if you ignore the power difference. If it had a tiny little turbo to give it some torque, I would probably have pulled the trigger, but as they stand they are a good first sports car, but anyone who has already owned a few non-mx5, RWD sports cars (S2000 and RX7 turbo in my case) will be looking elsewhere.

carporn,3bvuq0,amusicnebula,1 point,Tue Jul 7 06:56:38 2015 UTC,There was once a poor man in Italy who went to a Ferrari dealership to see the cars. Upon arrival he saw Enzo Ferrari and asked if he could drive one of his cars. Enzo told him that a poor man like him would never be able to drive a Ferrari. From that moment on he set a goal to create the best car in the world. The man's name was Ferruccio Lamborghini.
carporn,3bvuq0,Straighty180-,1 point,Tue Jul 7 07:26:25 2015 UTC,"Not quite the story I remembered. Here's an excerpt from his website.  Furruccio Lamborghini was born into a family of grape farmers, and was always interested in mechanics. After serving in the air force during World War II, Ferruccio took advantage of the post-war need for agriculture supplies by repurposing military machines into tractors. When his tractor business brought him wealth and success, he did what many middle-aged men dream of and in 1958 bought a Ferrari (along with a few other luxury cars of course, but it’s the Ferrari that concerns this story). Ferruccio was happy indulging his passion for cars and even tried his hand at racing once, but because he knew a little something about mechanics, he couldn’t help but notice a few things that he would change. For Ferruccio's taste the Ferrari was too noisy and rough for use on the road, and it had an inferior clutch that often needed repairing.  In the early 1960s Enzo Ferrari and his cars were arguably the reigning superpower of luxury sports cars. Ferruccio Lamborghini took his complaints about his Ferrari all the way to Enzo, who didn’t exactly appreciate being given technical notes from a young tractor manufacturer. When Enzo told him as much, a rivalry was born and Ferruccio’s hobby of driving fast cars turned into a passion for vindication.  Driven by Enzo’s insult, Ferruccio got to work designing his car, and in just 4 months unveiled the Lamborghini 350 GTV at the Turin Motor Show in October 1963. By the end of 1964 Lamborghini sold his first 13 cars (renamed 350 GT), and although he did so at a loss to keep prices competitive with Ferrari, the humble tractor manufacturer proved to be a formidable rival over the years. It all goes to show that no matter how successful, it’s never a good idea to underestimate your critics"

carporn,3bpra1,Leon_Trout,-1,Wed Jul 1 14:35:27 2015 UTC,"Not a truck engine, just happens to be the same size but shares nothing in common with the truck engine.    It's closer to a Lamborghini engine than a Dodge truck engine."
carporn,3bpra1,rbs14k,7,Wed Jul 1 19:51:34 2015 UTC,"The centerpiece of the car was its engine. The Lamborghini Company, then owned by Chrysler Corporation, designed the V10 for the Viper by recasting the block and heads in an aluminum alloy, and was based off Chrysler's V8 engine.   https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viper_engine  Keep in mind that in 1992, the year the gen 1 Viper debuted, the only V8 powered vehicles that Chrysler had in it's line up were trucks and SUVs. In fact, I'm fairly certain that the Challenger/Charger/Magnum/300 family were the first V8 powered cars Chrysler had made since the 80s."
carporn,3bpra1,TheSRTgreg,0,Wed Jul 1 20:28:32 2015 UTC,Yeahhhhh... this has nothing to do with the rev limit though. The rev limit has everything to do with the fact that it was 8.0L in the Gen 1.

carporn,3bpra1,z4cz0r,6,Wed Jul 1 19:09:28 2015 UTC,"What kind of price do they sell for in the USA?  I'm from New Zealand, and they are rare as rocking horse shit down here, and worth an absolute packet."
carporn,3bpra1,iamtehstig,5,Wed Jul 1 10:10:33 2015 UTC,"I'm from New Zealand, and they are rare as rocking horse shit down here, and worth an absolute packet.    That is possibly the most kiwi thing I have ever read.  *g"
carporn,3bpra1,greymalken,3,Wed Jul 1 18:26:04 2015 UTC,"They are rare here too because not many were made, and then of course many have been crashed or caught fire.  The GTS specifically goes for $25000-$50000 depending on condition and mileage.  For $25k it would be a pretty crappy car, for $50k it would be a mint condition car with perhaps 5k miles on it and a desirable paint color."
carporn,3bpra1,JackD0710,1 point,Wed Jul 1 11:33:31 2015 UTC,$50k sounds downright reasonable. Aren't fully loaded late model Mustang GTs in the $45k range?
carporn,3bpra1,Noofnoof,2,Wed Jul 1 22:35:46 2015 UTC,"I don't think the GT's are quite that high, but I could be wrong, perhaps a convertible GT with every option"

Thanks for putting this up and reminding me of a simpler time.  Now I'm going to furiously hunt ebay for something in my price range, lol!"

carporn,3bpra1,0l33l,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:11:20 2015 UTC,"I've had a lot of fast cars, but this one is the most raw.  I'm glad I didn't get a Porsche or another Z06 Vette.  This satisfies that craving for instant torque.  It has the lopey idle of an old muscle car, but the top speed and handling of a modern sports car.   The interior kind of blows though.  I don't mind the design, but its loose and cheap."
carporn,3bpra1,som_gye,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:53:48 2015 UTC,"Those were the biggest gripes I've read about that car since it's debut- the complete and total lack of creature comforts (a comfortable ride) and modern driving amenities (ABS, TCS, etc) making for a ride more intended for those that REALLY know how to drive.  And based off that, and it's looks, was how I fell in love with it.  A beautiful car with a challenge mode.  Challenge accepted."
carporn,3bpra1,TheSRTgreg,1 point,Fri Jul 3 06:51:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's fun to have something you feel you have to tame.  Granted, in a modern car you could turn all the electronics off, but most of these new cars are so disconnected from the driving experience.  When viper shopping I only considered really raw cars like a 993 porsche, lotus elise, z06 vette, etc.    I can live without traction control, but I admit not having ABS get's scary at times.  The car has really tiny calipers and the rear brakes do nothing.  The front tires lock up really easily if you don't progressively brake.  It's worth it though."

carporn,3bpra1,WoodyTwigs,1 point,Thu Jul 2 14:16:08 2015 UTC,You have a very beautiful viper that I would love to drive!  If you don't mind me asking what's the top speed and 0-60?
carporn,3bpra1,TheSRTgreg,2,Wed Jul 1 10:43:22 2015 UTC,"Thanks!  The stock specs are a top speed of over 190mph and 0-60 around 4 seconds.  This one has been modified and the 0-60 is substantially lower, but the top speed is also lower because the rear end gearing has been changing for better acceleration at lower speeds."

carporn,3bii64,onceapon,59,Mon Jun 29 19:38:48 2015 UTC,Black key = 500hp and no supercharger Red key = 707hp and supercharger  At purchase you get 1 black key and 2 red keys. I guess they figure no need to give you 2 black keys because once you use the red key its hard to back to the black one. It's already buried in my kitchen drawer.

If not I would never let someone else drive this thing, even with the black key.  edit: Decided not to be lazy   Those 2015 Dodge Challenger SRT Hellcat owners (and SRT 392 owners) who want to severely limit the capabilities of their new Hemi powered muscle cars can also chose Valet Mode. This system works through the infotainment screen with a simple 4 digit password and when engaged, it really sucks a lot of the fun out of the new SRT Challenger. Valet mode “significantly reduces” the horsepower with the rev limiter set to 4,000rpm, the automatic transmission locks out first gear and shortens the shifts for reduced performance, manual shift mode in automatic models is disable as are the steering wheel paddle shifters, traction control, the adjustable steering system and the suspension system are all locked into their “Street” setting, the Drive Mode feature is disabled, Launch Control is disabled and the Electronic Stability Control is locked to the full on position.

carporn,3bii64,Slowhand09,1 point,Mon Jun 29 19:54:45 2015 UTC,Why?  Is it in the manual to only drive with the black key for so many miles?    These engines are broken in before they even enter the car.  The only reason for a break in period is for the rest of the drivetrain.
carporn,3bii64,_Trilobite_,2,Tue Jun 30 13:25:31 2015 UTC,"Engines are ran in for an hour on a dyno.  It is in the manual to limit your max RPM and MPH for the 1st 500 miles.  You can do what you please.  I think its stupid to risk voiding your warranty by exceeding those limits.  If, just if, your trans blows up at 400 miles and the computer shows you redline the car repeatedly you get what you get."
carporn,3bii64,onceapon,2,Tue Jun 30 13:44:01 2015 UTC,"lol your taking my comment completely wrong.  I never said to redline the engine during break in.  I was wondering why the suggestion of only using the black key as I did not read that in the manual.  IIRC all Dodge engines are broke in from the factory.  Again, the only reason for the break in period is for the rest of the drivetrain.  When you reach 300 miles your actually supposed to use all of the RPM range:  300 to 500 miles (483 to 805 km): •Exercise the full engine rpm range, shifting manually (paddles or gear shift) at higher rpms when possible. •Do not perform sustained operation with the accelerator pedal at wide open throttle. •Maintain vehicle speed below 85 mph (136 km/h) and observe local speed limits.  IMO the black key should be destroyed once you take ownership of the car lol"
carporn,3bii64,shlerm,2,Tue Jun 30 13:51:39 2015 UTC,"No prob.  I read about other Hellcat owners being all ""pedal to the metal"" right from the showroom floor.  I chose to follow the book.  And one way to not push the limits was to limit myself to the Black Key.  A crutch for self-control vs the attraction to power via the Red Key.  I haven't carried the Black key since hitting 600 miles.  And I mostly drive in Track Mode just for the sound, but it trashes mileage as it raised the RPM level to shift into 8th gear. (OD #2)"

carporn,3bii64,Semyonov,5,Tue Jun 30 13:25:48 2015 UTC,"Modern automatic cars usually shift better, especially dual clutch gearboxes, but Manual transmissions are a more fun and active experience. If you are driving on a hilly road or flooring it through empty roads, a stick shift is just lots more entertaining and fun.   They are also better for gas mileage because you can coast well and use a higher gear for low speeds."

carporn,3bii64,trippytheshroom,1 point,Tue Jun 30 18:19:17 2015 UTC,automatic yields less control over the car.  So people who really love to drive often prefer the control and feel of a manual transmission.

Also, it was a horrible deep blue with fugly wheels/rims. Sticker was about $350k and I got it for $240k. Again, new - never titled and only 14 miles on it. I new I was gonna wrap it and make it look awesome. I took it from a 75 year old man to a 25 year old kid.   Here's what it looked like when I first got it -  http://i.imgur.com/92tlZKF.jpg  And now -  http://i.imgur.com/9F9kGhw.jpg?1  Drives like a dream. So much better then the S65. I loved the tech in the S65 but had massive problems with it.

It's like somebody set the copier on 'almost' and put a 2000 GT in. There are so many stylistic elements I like but they don't flow together quite right. There isn't a single line that flows naturally from front to back so it just seems awkward.   It's too long unless it has a straight 12 in the front the windshield is too vertical so it doesn't flow the side ducts look like an afterthought The roof looks like they designed a convertible but decided to do a coupe instead   I could go on, but it's just too much of a mashup of design for me. I do bet it's fun though."

Taillight position and size regulations, tailpipe position regulations, rear window regulations, boot lid height regulations.  Boot opening width regulations.  Look for the styling.  Did the designers do something different and attractive with the available shapes.  I think absolutely yes.  The split rear spoiler, the slightly angled circular quad exhaust and the boomarang highlights to the taillights all give the car a more aggressive and historically motorsport appearance than the Audi.  Also there is really nice repetition between the taillights and the diamond shapes housings of the tailpipe surrounds. Giving the Alfa a more unified look than the audi"

This photo is lit with diffused lighting because it's obviously a crappyt day.   The background is messy. How many Car and Driver shoots do you think go down in worn out strip malls? There's an ugly car rightbehind it that it's 'touching by perspective'. It makes the scene feel cluttered and is displeasing to the eye.   Bad placement of the car in frame. Why leave all that empty space behind it and still cut off a bit of the front bumper. Again, I'm here to see a car not a strip mall.  This is a good enough photo for the car spotting subs but not for a sub dedicated to pro-quality photos. I'm not trying to be a dick, just answering your question.

No interesting scenery, just a strip mall parking lot. No strobes or reflectors used, and it seems to be centered just behind the front wheel with the ground taking up a big chunk of the frame.

carporn,3b0b3v,Harain,2,Thu Jun 25 09:44:49 2015 UTC,"A very small handful of these were built. AMC had the panels hand formed by Italian metal workers - no wonder it has that Italian flair. From Wikipedia:    Widely considered as the best AMC design of all time, a third-generation AMX concept car, the AMX/3, debuted at the 1970 Chicago Auto Show. Engine-less and fashioned in fiberglass, the original AMC/3 prototype was a show car only. American Motors placed an order for 30 operational cars. The AMX/3 body mold was sent to Italian GT maker Giotto Bizzarrini, whose Turin facility hand made drivable mid-engined, steel bodied cars. Built on a 105.3-inch (2,675 mm) wheelbase, the Bizzarrini prototypes used the AMC 390 cu in (6.4 L) V8 and an Italian OTO Melara four-speed transaxle. Road testing was done by BMW, which declared the AMX/3's chassis one of the stiffest and most neutral handling they had ever tested.  The steel Italian cars differed from the original AMC design in having fewer but functional rear decklid louvers, louvered hoods, and, in some cases, hood scoops to direct fresh air into the heating-A/C system. Five completed cars were produced before the US$2,000,000 program was cancelled. Escalating costs and pending bumper regulations put a stop to the mid-engined AMX/3. The remaining extra parts were used by erstwhile Bizzarini collaborator Salvatore Diomante to assemble a sixth car.   That 390 cu. in. V8 is good for 325hp in a 1970 AMX."

Then restored into an Eleanor car.    I'm aware of one guy who let unique performance cut up a legit gt500 to turn into a ""super snake""  car.  Some rich kid bought the car at auction and let them destroy the car.    Here's a fun fact.  At the end of gene in sixty seconds,  the beater 'stang that the brother gives to Memphis,  is a real gt500 and was,  according to the guys who built the cars for the movies ""the nicest one of the bunch""  before they distressed it for the movie.

When I bough the car it has a rusty hood, hatch and doors. It also came with an extra set of those things tho. They didn't match of course. One door was purple/maroon, the hatch and other door were brown and the hood was black.  So everything got replaced, my dad has done body work his whole life and did all the work on it. Shaved the locks, got rid of all the nasty trim pieces, welded all the holes shut.  Trying to align parts from 3-4 separate cars is a nightmare and it's all pretty close, but it's not perfect.

carporn,3ath5m,claytonfromillinois,2,Thu Jun 25 01:43:32 2015 UTC,"Hey man, if you can't tell the difference, I won't hold it against you. Maintaining a style and iterating on it isn't bullshit, it's how you build an identity. Nice one with the kiddo thing though. How very mature of you."
carporn,3ath5m,Bandro,0,Thu Jun 25 01:51:07 2015 UTC,"I thought it about as mature as your clever ""gotcha"" logic. I can tell the difference. But it's boring and lazy and lacks creativity. Those companies push it to the extreme. It's not building an identity anymore. Everyone updates models, what the fuck is the point in wasting a ton of money producing. A new model when all you've done is extremely minor performance upgrade and moving a body panel half an inch and claiming it's a new car for fifty years in a row? It's stupid. Thank god not everyone uses this type of ""innovation"" otherwise we would just be using really fancy oil lamps for light, and delightfully nostalgic medical equipment."

carporn,3apkgz,K3R3G3,2,Mon Jun 22 17:01:20 2015 UTC,I'm not sure how the 488GTB will hold up against the looks of the Huracan. But like most new supercars I'll need to see one before I make a judgement.
carporn,3apkgz,K3R3G3,6,Mon Jun 22 17:09:54 2015 UTC,"It's important to see them in person, I agree. But my opinion prior to seeing them in person is that while the 488 is nice, aesthetically it's mainly a face-lifted/tweaked 458. The Huracan is a more like a whole new car. Sure, they're both faster and have great tech improvements, but I'm more drawn to and impressed by the Huracan. It's more visually appealing, imo, and it seems much more fun and exciting. The 488 being turbo'd doesn't really sound great nor is it better than the 458. The redline drops from 9,000 to 8,000, which is significant. But the NA V10 of the Huracan sounds pretty damn good. Plus, it's faster (except for 6mph top speed), lighter, and $150k cheaper than the Aventador.   TL;DR - IMO, the 488 is cool, but nothing earth shattering. The Huracan is an all-around home run."

carporn,3ao4br,seafood10,1 point,Mon Jun 22 15:23:08 2015 UTC,"There is a higher demand than Dodge anticipated.  They actually ramped up production to fill more orders but there is still more demand than supply (currently).  Production for the 2015 challenger is going to end soon I believe. I do not know when the last day you can order is.  If you really want a Hellcat at MSRP I would suggest just waiting for the 2016 model year (September I believe).  I am sure Dodge will respond to the high demand with more production next year and with the new allocation plan, the vendors who have been gouging customers with $20k uplifts will be punished by low allocations.  Both those factors should lead to them selling at MSRP.  When is the Shelby going to be released?"
carporn,3ao4br,DTru1222,1 point,Mon Jun 22 17:36:17 2015 UTC,"Thanks for that, did not know that the dealerships get punished!!??! Anyway, Shelby's will be 2016.

carporn,3ao4br,JobieWanKenobi,2,Mon Jun 22 12:12:05 2015 UTC,Front end is more flatter and has a wider open mouth for more air intake.  Hood has more air vents.  You'll know immediately when you see one.
carporn,3ao4br,wiseoracle,2,Mon Jun 22 13:32:41 2015 UTC,"Honestly, the one way i distinguish them is by the badge and the different nose. There are other special editions with the same wheels and brembos, so that doesnt help. Hood can sometimes be harder to spot than the nose imo. (I've been to the Chrysler plant a few times)"
carporn,3ao4br,Unicoasterglass,2,Mon Jun 22 14:47:14 2015 UTC,"Mainly the hood and the badge.  The Hellcat actually has a different bottom grill but to someone who is not familiar it will be difficult to notice.  The 6.4 SRT also has the hood scoop so what you need to look for is the vents on the hood.  They are pretty obvious but you have to be at the right angle.

carporn,3ao8p4,smartazz104,0,Mon Jun 22 05:55:26 2015 UTC,"Well, really, it depends on what model it is. And even then... not usually...  Most E-Types are worth $60-70k, and there's many, many Porsches worth more than that. To you, sure they may be more special, but really, to most people, according to the prices they go for, Porsche's can be more special."

If a BMW I8 is special to you than go post pics by all means. Hell, if a Honda Civic is special to you than whatever, it really doesn't matter."

carporn,3alixb,PassivePandas,8,Sun Jun 21 17:18:43 2015 UTC,It's a 2008.  The E92's came with the 414HP v8 that sounds beautiful and gets awful MPG's haha.  They seem to take pretty good care of their cars and I couldn't find anything wrong with it so I had no qualms about buying from them.
carporn,3alixb,Kookiemon5ter,3,Sun Jun 21 19:25:59 2015 UTC,Did you end up buying the warranty from them? I'm debating between a M3 vs a newer S4. I've heard that the E92 M3 is the most reliable M3 to date but part can be expensive...

It is an impressive build and I don't want to take away from that, but it falls short of those hail mary builds. And it's so close it bothers me.  If they had tied in a little aggression in the side skirts or even a brake duct in the rear haunch it would have pulled the ass in to the build more. The front is that perfect combination of sleek aggression, the ass is pure agressiveness. The sides are streamlined to become extremely sleek.

carporn,3aldlx,SHARPxSHOOTER,7,Sun Jun 21 09:53:27 2015 UTC,"Volvos are super cool. I wish their newer models weren't so....bland, though.  Which sounds strange to say, considering Volvo has built a brand around being regular yet classy, but those older 850s just call to me in a way modern Volvos never will."
carporn,3aldlx,s4ndp4p3rm4n,4,Sun Jun 21 13:54:59 2015 UTC,"I think Volvo is starting to make good progress with the new design language, but they need to start building all these badass polestar concepts to go up against ///M and AMG. I think the Chinese overlords want this to happen."

carporn,3aldlx,MistrDarp,4,Sun Jun 21 13:52:42 2015 UTC,"I didn't like the lines of the car at first. But after time and after walking around the car multiple times I started to notice the unique design of it and became fond of it. These cars are extremely rare. Yesterday I saw the V70R (wagon model of this car) with the same color and we both smiled at each other.  I love the Volvo community, we all give smiles and thumbs up each other when we are just strangers, but our cars bring us together."

carporn,3aldlx,Inflame,-1,Sun Jun 21 17:58:37 2015 UTC,I agree. Owned an s60r for the novelty... W things going for it broke within 4-6 months of ownership. Suspension no longer changed modes and awd broke... Still sold the car for $4000. Sounded great.

carporn,3ajbck,That_Duck,4,Sun Jun 21 00:30:33 2015 UTC,"All we know for certain is that he's produced a few movies that no one has heard of. So he certainly didn't make it all that way. Rumors include real estate investing, inheritance, and/or running a drug cartel. Pick your favorite."
carporn,3ajbck,edroth555,3,Sun Jun 21 00:38:30 2015 UTC,"Not that I've seen him go on the record but I believe he did have an investment fund of some sort before he moved to LA and began to produce.  Is it so unreasonable to think he's made $15-30 million dollars and feels comfortable with blowing $1-3 million on a car now and then?    Not like the Hellgato cost all that much, anyways.  $900,000 918 and at least a few million on the 730S.  The cars he has won't plummet in depreciation either.  Shop around for a Porsche Carrera GT for shits...they're worth more now than when they came out."
carporn,3ajbck,Mmer03,2,Sun Jun 21 05:21:49 2015 UTC,Personally from doing some creeping on his instagram i am assuming inheritance because he hangs out with some kid Gonzal00 who is basically as trust fund baby as they get.

carporn,3aa942,Genesis2nd,9,Thu Jun 18 17:14:14 2015 UTC,"I'm simply drawing from what I've heard from Top Gear, here..  Apparently, the Huracán is boring for a Lamborghini, which isn't saying much, since they usually bonkers as hell. That, they played it safe with this one, instead of having the personality usually associated with Lambos. And some other exaggerations that only Clarkson could come with.  But, as you say, is it even possible to get bored of a Lamborghini? Saying this is boring for a Lamborghini is like saying Dark Souls isn't as tough as Demon Souls. It may not be as tough, but it's still bloody tough."

carporn,3aa942,Exploding_Bowels,9,Thu Jun 18 18:26:07 2015 UTC,No the customer has asked him to take it for a bit say for example they go on vacation and don't want to leave it around he'll take it. He doesn't take brand new cars with no milage on them and go crazy he'd lose a lot of money doing that.
carporn,3aa942,iwebb335,-5,Thu Jun 18 19:22:01 2015 UTC,"Definitely wouldn't make them lose money..... it's still a brand new car. Most times brand new cars are driven, if they are driven a lot or someone dailys it for a while, the dealership has to sell it as a demo."

I can't find a good tool thin that's thin but stiff enough.  And how did you maintain/replace the door trim(roof ledge).  I can't find any that isn't less then 200 bucks :(."
carporn,3aa5r1,the_wang,2,Thu Jun 18 21:39:57 2015 UTC,"I have more automotive detailing processes and products than I could possibly list, but the wheel process goes as such:   Spray down the wheel to remove loose debris Prepare a bucket of car shampoo and a water-only rinse bucket If the wheels are extra dirty (perhaps from winter driving), use a wheel-only wash mit or microfiber towel to gently wipe away the grime. Scrub the sidewalls of my tire with a tire brush and some All-Purpose Cleaner to remove old tire dressing and road filth. Spray off. Spray Iron-X or a similar chemical onto the wheels. Agitate using a boars hair brush. I then use a boars hair lug nut brush to get into the tiny holes and between the lugs, as wheel as in between each wheel spoke and underneath the air nozzle. Thoroughly rinse off the the wheel. You can take this further with a hand-drill attachment or arched wheel woolie to clean behind the spokes and into the wheel. If my wheels are fairly clean, I'll use some Green Wheel Cleaner instead of Iron-X. Finally, tire shine. I complete this step after I have washed the rest of the vehicle. Adam's Super VRT is great for  tires and trim, but lately I have been applying Poorboy's tire dressing (using a tire applicator). I really like the wet yet satin finish it provides and it never slings. It's also cheaper. Super VRT is still great for car trim, which I use regularly. Don't forget to scrub down your exterior trim with an All-Purpose Cleaner before application. There are also various sealants and waxes for wheels that make future wheel-cleaning a breeze.    So yeah, that's the wheel process. I do this for each wheel and tire every time I wash my car. I can knock them all out in 20-30 minutes if I'm busting my ass. The bottom line is I have a process down and I use only high quality products to maintain my vehicle. I also do a full detail every couple of years. Meaning, correct and seal my car's paint using a rotary buffer and a range of paint correcting products. I then seal it overnight and wax it the next day. Sometimes I go into every nook and cranny with Q-Tips and All-Purpose Cleaner to clean the inside of my gas panel, door hinges, water runoff/debris channels, etc. Pretty much anywhere I can reach until it's brand new again. A full detail takes me 3-5 full days to complete, depending on how far I take the process, including the interior.  Anyone can do this with practice, but mostly time. Lots and lots of time. Which is why it's a hobby!  Make sure to check out /r/AutoDetailing. Adam's Polishes also has high def video demonstrations for nearly every product, no matter how trivial it may seem. While I'm a big fan of their products, the service, and the company, the bottom line is that video training is crucial to my workflow and these kinds of demonstrations are useful no matter what product you are using. I try all kinds of products and tools until I find a workflow that is best and I'm always looking to improve my detailing workflow.  EDIT: I forgot to answer your other question. For the sunroof lining, I'll spray some All-Purpose Cleaner onto a microfiber and vigorously scrub the spongy lining until it's black again."

carporn,3aaf6l,SwImJeT,9,Thu Jun 18 16:55:04 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure anyone is able to pick up these used ones for sale, and that's why they carry such a heavy price tag.

carporn,3aaf6l,Patruck9,11,Thu Jun 18 17:06:28 2015 UTC,"It's the fact that Ferrari are a bunch of sticklers when it comes to who can own their most exclusive cars and who can't. That makes this car that much more valuable second hand. A killer business move for the millionaires already approved for a LaFerrari, but who really don't want one all that badly.  I believe the rules are you must have purchased at least 5 Ferrari's NEW from the company before even being considered by them for their flagship car.   I've also heard stories that people weren't even allowed to buy their first new Ferrari from a specific dealer without first owning a Maserati. I don't know if that has ever been confirmed. I don't think many people went out of their way to find out, only because it's so believable that Ferrari would do something like that."

I mean at this point in my life, I can't realistically say I'm going to be able to afford ANY newer Ferrari model without some drastic luck..but even if I could, I doubt I'd spend my money with them knowing how they treat most people who don't fit their idea of what a Ferrari owner looks like/should be.  I was never much a fan of Porsche (who also owns my local McLaren dealer in the Philly area) but whenever they get a special edition or their flagship in, they're glad to share it with the public. I don't feel ostracized showing up to the Porsche dealer looking to check out the new 991 GT3 or most recently a 918 & 917 in the same showroom. I don't feel out of place when I show up to McLaren interested in checking out the new P1 or 675LT they have on the floor.

carporn,3aaf6l,ohmarchitect,2,Fri Jun 19 01:01:49 2015 UTC,You can't just put down 1.6 Million and buy a LaFerrari - Ferrari will only sell it to you if you already have a collection of Ferrari cars. It's a marketing trick where they convince wealthy people that they are part of an exclusive list and then the wealthy people feel privileged to overpay for a super-rare car.  I bet the person selling this will be taken off the list of approved buyers.

carporn,3aaf6l,ohmarchitect,1 point,Fri Jun 19 19:32:12 2015 UTC,"I suppose 'overpaying' isn't the right word it because you are paying for what it's worth.  However, if you look at the cost of materials, labor, R&D, marketing and other overhead costs - I doubt it costs anywhere near 1.5 million.   What I meant by overpaying is that a lot of the price comes from its exclusivity and prestige."

carporn,3aay7w,CutlassSupremo,3,Thu Jun 18 21:34:39 2015 UTC,"From www.conceptcarz.com:   The Ferrari 250 LM made its debut at the 1963 Paris Auto Salon and first competed the following year. Designed for the GT class at Le Mans, 100 cars were needed to obey the homologation rules, but not surprisingly only 32 cars were finished; the LM was therefore only eligible for the prototype class against more powerful cars. Despite that, the Ferrari 250 LMs performed well, including a win at the 1965 24 Hours of Lemans. The 250 LM used the 250 GTO 3-liter, V12 engine bored out to 3.3 liters and repositioned in the middle of the chassis."

carporn,3a8xse,acog,5,Thu Jun 18 15:53:39 2015 UTC,"Well, that's the big question, isn't it? For the vast majority of car enthusiasts the answer is no. But they're a low volume company. If they move a few hundred of these that's considered quite successful at their size.   What they're looking for are hardcore Mustang fans who really cherish the Shelby name, who want a big horsepower car and don't want to do it piecemeal themselves. That doesn't describe a huge pool of people, but there are enough to keep them in business.  There's also the side benefit that cars like this generate publicity and keep the company's name in the news. There will be lots of people who don't purchase the whole kit, but they'll just get a clutch or a brake kit, etc. So a halo car like this will indirectly help their performance parts business too."
carporn,3a8xse,songalong,1 point,Thu Jun 18 16:12:38 2015 UTC,"hmmm so you don't have to purchase the whole kit, and just choose what parts you want on there?"
carporn,3a8xse,acog,2,Thu Jun 18 16:23:03 2015 UTC,"I can't say for sure with this car but that's usually the way it works. Generally the company builds one with all the bells and whistles as a PR car but when you buy it you can decide that you don't want the body kit or you don't want the interior pieces etc. Part of the appeal is how much you can customize it to your taste and budget.   But when I was referring to their performance parts business I mean just that. Entirely separate from their business building fully running cars, you can buy all sort of parts from them for your own projects. So you might want to just mildly customize your Mustang with a Shelby shock tower brace or whatever."

While it's not framed well and the lighting is off, the actual photo quality is high, the body of the car is center, and the colors are crisp as well as the lines of the car clear. It's not professional photography, but the shapes of the car come through, and major details along with it.  Honestly, taking this any further is a waste of time, because it's all opinion and preference in the end, but at the very least comparing this post to a ""blurry picture of a rock"" is inaccurate."

carporn,3a5rrs,lonewolf420,2,Wed Jun 17 20:52:12 2015 UTC,The N54 is a solid motor people are making 860+hp on stock internals with bigger single turbos or rebuilt compressors on stock turbines running E85 mixes. The only thing that bothers me about my 335i is it runs hot (even with the oil cooler) and the waste gates rattle a bit some times during idle. The great thing about new turbo cars is most are water cooled turbos so you don't need to worry about turbos losing oil/cooling after shutting the engine off. On the 335i they program the water pump to run for a little while after turning off the engine really improves their life cycle sort of like a turbo timer that runs a little bit to cool the oil going to the turbo.   I don't mind working on mine rather than take it to someone else just buy the special tools from BMS for cheep to change spark plugs/oil filters and either jack stand things for the mounting points or just get ramps.

Its design was inspired by the sport prototypes of the era, such as the Ford GT40 and Ferrari 250 LM, famous for its shares in the 24 Hours of Le Mans.

I'm happy with the color combo although if I had it to do over again I might do black wheels. Regardless, I love the look of a white car with black vents/grills and red brake calipers. I remember just flipping out when I first saw a white AMG E63 and later a white C7 Corvette.

We were all sturdy guys anywhere from 180 lbs to 250 lbs.   13 of us idiots crammed into the wagon and were driving through town.  At a local high school hot spot,  we were able to snag two small girls from our class and got up to 15 people and still driving.    That was one of the funniest nights of my life.  Each new house we showed up to,  yelling at the guy to get in and him say,  ""Jesus! OK!"""

EDIT: also looks like this is a super beetle and not the standard. Supers are typically a little lower cost since the desirable beetles are basically all pre 1970 and the super was introduced in 1971. Of course it all comes down to personal taste. Give me a 66 with fluted lenses, yellow fogs and DP1600 dropped on lowering spindles and I'm pretty happy :)"

In this picture you can see the large coil spring over the strut.   The standard Beetle front suspension is called torsion bar which has two parallel beams filled with stacked steel plates that when twisted act as the coil spring for the suspension. This is picture of a standard front beam  Also, the tell tale sign its a super is the slotted front lower valence"

carporn,39pmsd,TruePotentiaI,6,Sat Jun 13 22:55:56 2015 UTC,"I'll try and make a long story short. Lotus had a 5 year exemption from US Federal bumper and air bag standards, they could import and sell their cars during that period which did not meet those standards during that period but after that they needed to comply with them or they would no longer be able to import their vehicles. Lotus was hoping that they would sell enough cars during that period in the US to justify the enormous expense to bring their cars up to those standards, but unfortunately they didn't so when the 5 year exemption ran up they stopped importing them (Elise and Exige) I believe the Evora actually does meet those standards and are still sold here in current model years every year.   TL:DR  US Federal airbag and bumper standards. The amount of cars Lotus sells in the states doesn't justify the cost of making their cars meet those standards. With the exception of the Evora and the new Evora 400 which I believe will be imported in the US."

carporn,39pmsd,LElige,1 point,Sun Jun 14 03:39:12 2015 UTC,It doesn't meet bumper regulations. The only reason there are Elise's and exiges in the states is because lotus had a 5 year exemption that expired for the bumpers.

carporn,39pmsd,LElige,2,Sun Jun 14 01:42:42 2015 UTC,"iirc vehicles in the us must withstand a 5mph impact to the bumper with no damage.  The lotus, having a body of fiberglass and using clams instead of separate bumpers don't meet those requirements. Lotus was manufacturing so few units that they were able to get a 5 year exemption. They could not renew that exemption when it expired. I'm sure now there are even more regulations that the exige would fail.

carporn,39kygi,xcrackpotfoxx,-15,Fri Jun 12 15:52:35 2015 UTC,I really do mind it. Couldn't they have turbocharged a V8?
carporn,39kygi,dumkopf604,15,Fri Jun 12 19:39:14 2015 UTC,I don't know. The sixxer is probably lighter than a v8.
carporn,39kygi,xcrackpotfoxx,2,Fri Jun 12 19:53:11 2015 UTC,It's actually heavier than the coyote 5.0 v8 iirc. I have recently been doing research on them as I'd either like to build a v6 xr4ti or a v6 escort and have to go with the 3.7 duratec as it seems it may be lighter than the 3.5 ecoboost which from what I've heard on forums is heavier than the 5.0 coyote
carporn,39kygi,kamon123,1 point,Sat Jun 13 07:54:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the coyote is lighter because its all aluminum, but its the size of a cammer or a boss 429 since its dohc. The 302 can also be stroked to a 331 if you want and is definitely cheaper. Also available are aluminum heads and blocks which would probably equalize the weight some."
carporn,39kygi,xcrackpotfoxx,1 point,Sat Jun 13 13:23:03 2015 UTC,"Sounds like it could have been a choice between power and size/aerodynamics or weight. The larger engine would require a larger space to occupy which may have had negative effects on aero or the added weight of the structure being enlarged may have made a coyote engined ford gt actually heavier than an ecoboost v6 gt even though the ecoboost is the heavier engine. The chassis isn't weightless and all that jazz and anything to negate that weight gain would probably be looked down upon by the bean counters due to cost. Actually I could see it being a mix of all of these combined. That maybe in the end the ecoboost was 100% the better choice for both money, performance and PR as they need to advertise the new ecoboost so can't exactly throw the duratec 37 in there."
carporn,39kygi,kamon123,6,Sat Jun 13 13:30:18 2015 UTC,"I think that the 6 is fine. Cars like this (halo cars) are supposed to represent the direction the company is going, not where they've been. If you look at the kind of stuff that Ford is doing with the EcoBoost branded engines, you'll see that they're focusing on smaller & lighter while still being powerful.  In my opinion, the V6 is a step in the right direction."
carporn,39kygi,OkGoogol,2,Fri Jun 12 21:26:34 2015 UTC,If you've seen the prototype car running in the Tudor series you wouldn't be complaining about a V6
carporn,39kygi,mustanggt2003,0,Sat Jun 13 00:37:18 2015 UTC,"I don't doubt it's a good engine. Just that's it's not as cool as a V8. A 488 GTB still has a V8, even if it is turbocharged, as does the Corvette. Aston Marin still has a V12."

carporn,39kygi,mustanggt2003,0,Sat Jun 13 03:52:06 2015 UTC,What I'm saying is a V8 can do that just fine.

But we're talking about the impact of money. I can't remember where I read it, so sorry for not being able to provide a source, but I read something along the lines of ""ones happiness always remains roughly the same."" Of course, sometimes something happens that makes us sad, but happy people tend to quickly go back to being happy.   I am, and have always been a very happy person. All of this despite living in a poor country, and having roughly 10$/month during high-school as pocket money. Now, during college, I moved and I now work part-time for more money than my parents make combined and can buy video games, go to festivals and parties and have spare money to spend my vacation at home. Am I happier? No. Is my life better? Definitely."

Legally, it would make sense for it give Ferrari full discretion in determining if a customer's alterations qualify as defacing the vehicle.  Also, from a business perspective, they aren't actually going to go after 100% of the people that alter their car's appearance. If it is sufficiently well-done, Ferrari may let it slide, even though they have the right to sue since it is still technically a breach of contract.  He also may have consulted with Ferrari before the alteration in order to obtain permission to do this."

Mercedes holds the reigns at the moment (I think they did a great job with the GLA, for example). Audi lost me with their new too sharp angles, I just can't like the R8's new front end, among others. BMW's connect to lights to grille was bad enough when I saw the 3-series, but this is just next level. What are they doing?

There was some cat on the forums that went by peloton35 or something and he knew everything there was to know. I'm sure he is still around but he was my hero back then.  Now I just work all the time. Those were the days."
carporn,39ayv8,muricaa,4,Thu Jun 11 03:14:15 2015 UTC,"Erik is a friend of mine, as you say he is still as involved with them as ever. :)  Hopefully for you knowing #036's owner might mean you can see it? Nothing like rekindling that childhood obsession by getting up close and personal with one of these magnificent beasts."
carporn,39ayv8,Ornate_Giant,9,Thu Jun 11 03:20:33 2015 UTC,"Oh awesome to know he is still around. I'm sure he knows but you should def tell him he made a lasting impression on a kid 10+ years ago and had a hand in sparking a life long love affair.  I am fortunate that I get to see #36 fairly regularly and the owner has a P1 and a 650s lemans, so they are all parked as a happy little family.  Don't get me wrong, I will always have love for the F1. I just don't have the time anymore to research and read and talk about it constantly anymore. This is the first time in years I've talked online about it oddly enough.  Hopefully one day I'll retire with one in my garage and get to be one of those cool owners who participates in the forums and hooks people up with dream rides."

Edit: Here's a quote from him that may or may not be relevant to the crash but still worth reading:   I'm not a collector. I don't like the toy cupboard syndrome that causes so many good cars to evaporate. It depresses me that they are hidden away like investment art, or gold ingots in a Swiss vault. The McLaren is just so usable, it is a crime not to use it. No gritted teeth, you just get in and drive.

There's definitely more than one in the U.S. And if it's Ferarri they won't even let you buy it unless you've already owned a couple of them. This must be a 2nd hand dealer.

carporn,39c74m,cleverkid,4,Wed Jun 10 22:25:20 2015 UTC,"*you had to apply to buy this car. It didn't matter who you were or what you've owned. Every original purchaser was selected by Ferrari.

carporn,39c74m,Raenman,1 point,Thu Jun 11 04:34:22 2015 UTC,"Well, I have a friend who's dad has been buying Ferarri's for over a decade and he was telling me that to get the more exotic models you had to have been ""in the Ferrari club"" for a while. So, I think at least a bit of their criteria is that you are a faithful Ferrari owner. But then again, what do I know about it. :)   Either way, I guess this car at this non-standard dealership is someone's ticket to jumping that queue. But I also heard somewhere that if Ferrari ""allowed"" you to buy one you agreed not to sell it on the second hand market. Not sure how that would work legally."

I think it's what's driving the price so high so fast on this edition. The Enzo sold for relatively cheap compared to this in the same time frame from release. I was rather surprised to find out an acquaintance had gotten refused. He's in a similar situation as your friend. Has bought, owned, and sold a number of Ferrari's. I kinda wanted to see the letter.

carporn,399fef,RandomGenera7ed,7,Wed Jun 10 12:18:22 2015 UTC,"Weight affects braking, cornering and acceleration. There is only so much power can do. A lot of the twin turbo Gallardos are borderline useless on anything that isn't a perfect surface and drag tires."
carporn,399fef,breakfasthash,4,Wed Jun 10 13:19:57 2015 UTC,"Around a track? You sure will with a TT Gallardo. Power isn't all that makes a car fast. Power to weight ratio is what makes a car fast. The Sesto has a lower center of gravity, shorter stopping distance, better handling, and better acceleration/usable power (dead stop or out of a corner) compared to anything built by Underground Racing (kings of the TT Gallardo). Drag races are a completely different story though but a 1/4 mile race would still be damn close between a Sesto and a TT Gallardo."
carporn,399fef,hcarguy,8,Wed Jun 10 14:09:10 2015 UTC,"Stupid comment. With that logic I could buy a Civic, and with extensive modification make it faster than a Lamborghini. You're missing the bloody point."
carporn,399fef,Kent_Pumpkin,6,Wed Jun 10 12:00:25 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure that the whole point of the post you're replying to is that you could compete with the car spec-wise for less money?
carporn,399fef,hcarguy,7,Wed Jun 10 12:19:18 2015 UTC,"""Im going to assume handling wise, theyre pretty identical"".   No. Absolutely not, one car weighs close to 1000kg, the other is 50% heavier. They would handle completely differently and the technique to drive each fast differs vastly.  The point I was satirising is that OP said a TT Gallardo could achieve similar lap times. So could a Civic if you bothered to modify it enough. It's missing the point, similar lap times do not mean the cars are of a similar spec or drive anything alike."
carporn,399fef,pjs79,3,Wed Jun 10 13:09:02 2015 UTC,Not a chance in hell even if you spent 300k on a used gallardo it wouldn't even come close to handling like a sesto

carporn,396ftj,MrD3a7h,22,Tue Jun 9 19:10:25 2015 UTC,"Any reason to buy so far out-of-state? Besides the drive back, obviously."
carporn,396ftj,MrD3a7h,42,Tue Jun 9 19:14:35 2015 UTC,"In my shoes, I can't ask any questions so I'm not exactly sure why lol. When I was talking to him he knew what he wanted, exterior/interior color, color of wheels, trim level, price.... everything. My guess is he did some research and found ours to be the perfect one. I don't think it mattered to him how far away it was, just that he got what he wanted, you know? I'm sure there's one closer to him but he didn't see it. He could have went to a local dealership and just ordered it. Like I said, you can't really question anything in that situation"
carporn,396ftj,Nitronejo,10,Tue Jun 9 19:37:02 2015 UTC,Is it cheaper to buy a car off the lot or order it from the manufacturer?
carporn,396ftj,Threedawg,37,Tue Jun 9 19:56:39 2015 UTC,"As long as its sold at sticker then there's no difference. He could have ordered it to save himself the hassle of flying out here, I guess. But hey, maybe he wanted to come all of the way out here so he could have a nice scenic route on his way home in his new vette. Funny enough.. 500 miles into the route home he will have to get an oil change."

No matter how much the dealership made, we couldn't make over $1500, so if the profit was above $6000 (which only happened to me once in 2 years selling VWs and Subsrus) we would just give some up to spite the owner. We also didn't get any extra kickback from F&I."
carporn,396ftj,SkylineR33FTW,1 point,Wed Jun 10 04:04:45 2015 UTC,"My wife is the overall General Manager for 5 dealerships where we live. They sell Hondas and Toyotas. Their salesmen get 25% of the profit after ""pack"" (pack is $500 over invoice). No max, but a minimum of $75 paid out. Their backend cut is only 15% of F&I, warranty, etc. Backend is really just a bonus because it doesn't pay much.  They are trying to open up a VW dealership, but are having local issues with the city in developing the land. However VW has some weird rules and the salesmen will only make 20% on the front, but will make 20% on the back too. Don't know if the land deal will go through though.  We're not that big of a city ~200k people and we sell around 400 cars a month avg between the two new car dealerships. Is that a lot were you guys are from? Its a lot for here."
carporn,396ftj,TheGuy968,1 point,Wed Jun 10 12:25:05 2015 UTC,"Sounds a lot better than my old dealership. Our minimum was $100 but the rest sounds the same, besides no back end cut for us and we had a commission cap ($1500 on new, $2000 on used).   VW was a pain in the ass to deal with for our management the whole time I was there. We also weren't big fans of them as salesmen because they rarely did any sort of bonus for salesmen and when they did, they were typically pretty lofty goals with only a week or two to hit them. Strange that VW wants to regulate what your salesmen make though. At my old dealership, we still made 25% on VWs (although its been a couple of years since I worked there).  400 cars a month would be huge in our area, but I am in a small city with only about 25k people. We only had a few salesmen and typically did 50-65 cars a month total (VW, Subaru, and used cars combined)"

The two managers I work for couldn't be any better at what they do and they're the most laid back people on the planet. I got lucky with this place, but overall I advise people to look elsewhere for work. Unless of course you are a girl and like cars, then YES! Go sell cars. Anyway, I've heard about other managers at different dealerships, holy cow.. I wouldn't last a minute at most dealerships.  Thank you, sir!"
carporn,396ftj,fishydeeds,3,Tue Jun 9 17:50:47 2015 UTC,"Interested in this line of work but in the UK, what kind of things have you heard that's put you off?"
carporn,396ftj,BeatznFlowz,2,Tue Jun 9 23:36:12 2015 UTC,"I had to get on my computer to respond to this. So, most sales managers are completely and undeniably the worst type of people. They will do whatever it takes to make their paycheck, and to be honest most salesman are like that too, sure. However, with the authority managers have they will use any reason to fire you as a salesman. Job security isn't really a thing in that type of environment. If you don't make 20-30 phone calls a day they'll get rid of you for someone else that will. They will blame you for each car you don't sell. They'll yell/cuss at you for making mistakes, they won't give you second chances. Ask them a question they don't like? Yeah have fun. Disagree with them? Again, have fun with that. They will put so much pressure on you so that either 1) you will do whatever it takes to sell every person you talk to or 2) you will quit so they can try someone else. I can't even put into words how much you DON'T mean to them. You are NOTHING to them. They will demand from you every day. If you get behind on the leader-board you better watch your back and stay away from them. You could sell 30 cars in a month and that makes you hero for about a day, the new months starts over and you're back to nothing. They play favorites. Their ego is higher than space. The list goes on and on..  Now, not every dealership is like that, like mine for example. It's an absolute breeze. Sometimes it gets out of hand how goofy everyone is and how much fun we have during the day. Sales managers are a different type of breed though. Not to mention... they're alcoholics/drug addicts.. you don't want to be around those types of people, you know?  Personally, I do not belong in this industry.. it's for a certain type of person.. and it's not me. Luckily, where I work.. I can be myself. I can do things the way I want to, I don't have to make 30 phone calls a day to keep my job. I can skip out on an ""up"" if I'm talking with a friend or whatever and no one bats an eye, someone else will pick them up, and that's why I like my job. Other dealerships? If a customer even gets to the front door without being greeted? That's when you get out of the building and take a walk, you don't want to be around to hear what the manager would have to say about that.  My favorite.. managers have a saying, it's ""call until they buy, or die"" is that something you could do? I sure as hell can't and I certainly won't. On top of all of the pressure, you have surveys sent to your customers that buy cars, have a couple of bad ones? They'll threaten your job and not think twice about it.  I could go on forever about this, this job is really an experience. Good and bad, LOTS of ups and downs. Back stabbing every day.. It's emotionally exhausting, lots of hours, it's stressful. It's just something you don't want to get involved in. For fucks sake you don't even get weekends, I miss my weekends man :/  The money can be extremely rewarding selling cars but go work at a place where you know you're getting paid and how much you're getting paid. Work for someone that won't be breathing down your neck every waking day. I'm going to be honest and tell you I've never made this much money in my life, but I wish I was doing something else.

carporn,3974ra,Cntread,8,Tue Jun 9 21:10:35 2015 UTC,The Yellowbird would top out at 211 mph. Unlike the F40 these days a Yellowbird would actually be pretty inconspicuous- most people would just assume its an old 911.
carporn,3974ra,K3R3G3,5,Tue Jun 9 21:31:42 2015 UTC,"Yup. I mean the 911 Turbos of the time were no joke, but the CTR is in a different league than them (in that generation.)

carporn,3974ra,WinterIsComin,6,Tue Jun 9 22:01:33 2015 UTC,"I've driven both with a wheel and pedals in Assetto Corsa for the PC. From at least a sim perspective, the Ruf loosens up the faster you push it and you can really feel the back end squirm during hard braking. The gears are also absurdly long in the Ruf. The F40 by comparison feels like it has much more downforce and grip overall. Gears are still long, but not as long as the Ruf. The power comes on a little earlier in the RPM range in the F40, too.   F40 feels more 'racecar', the Ruf feels more like a hoon."

As far as the driving and handling characteristics in addition to general sensations, I'm sure they're very different, but both fully awesome. I'd love love love one of each, as well.

I've been well aware of this since childhood, had family who owned such a vehicle, but the more I think about it, the more absurd it seems that someone would pitch the idea to combine wood and metal.  Cars were never made of wood. It's not nostalgic or retro. It just seems...backwards. Is it just remnants of a time period plagued with gaudy design?"
carporn,397rxt,AnalogDogg,3,Wed Jun 10 05:03:20 2015 UTC,Never seen a woody? They were factory made vehicles back in the 30's & 40's and a lot of of cars from 30's and earlier used wood for structural support.

carporn,39597z,zanthraxnl,52,Tue Jun 9 15:11:05 2015 UTC,Manufacturers probably don't want to risk people fixing or parting out a crashed car.

carporn,39597z,cakedestroyer,9,Tue Jun 9 19:28:08 2015 UTC,Well that one could be easily prevented by waiting until the model's release before selling the crash tested one. The first reason sounds solid though.
carporn,39597z,jesusmcpenis,6,Tue Jun 9 21:38:07 2015 UTC,No way. That's a test vehicle meaning it hasn't yet been certified as road worthy. They'd never be able to transfer it to a buyer.

I had the plan that if I ever was to become wealthy, I would buy a bunch of them (since the AF retired them) and invite former AF pilots to fly them and relieve some of the good times.  It was one of the most loved AF jets ever.  I would also wanted run a ""pilot for a day"" program for underprivileged kids and kids with terminal diseases (we used to do that in the AF) like the make a wish foundation did.  So I found this video the other day.  I flew that exact tail number in the claws getting chopped up near the end of the video. :(   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bz81-6HN_FE"
carporn,39597z,thehornedone,1 point,Tue Jun 9 23:54:45 2015 UTC,"As an AF acquisitions guy...if it makes you feel any better, your dream probably never would have been feasible anyway considering that just buying the A/C is merely half the battle. You would need a lot of parts, tools, and T.O.s (which all have data rights associated) just to keep those 60+ year old birds in the air. Most of those parts are obsolete and would be prohibitively expensive or rare to track down so you'd need a machine shop to produce them just as the maintenance and logistics squadrons used to. Point being, there's a huge and expensive logistical trail that comes with the ops support side, which becomes more expensive the older the aircraft is due to obsolescence and data rights issues in the original production contracts."

carporn,39597z,I_am_Bob,76,Tue Jun 9 10:23:01 2015 UTC,The real purpose of crash test is to see how much force the driver and passenger experience. Just because a car appears to hold up well in the crash doesn't mean it keeps the people inside safe.
carporn,39597z,wilfordsy,25,Tue Jun 9 13:17:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah. If I remember correctly, most cars today try to actually damage the car body itself to ""absorb most of the force"" of the crash and minimize the force on the driver and passengers. That's why you see cars that looked like a bulldozer ran over it while the driver and passengers are okay."
carporn,39597z,likemong,12,Tue Jun 9 15:30:53 2015 UTC,"Exactly, cars are full of crumple zones now. The energy is absorbed by the vehicle and transferred around the passenger compartment. If you look at a car that has been in a front end collision, the car will be buckled by the C pillar and roof line. Along with the crush caps and rails in the frame/uni-body in the engine compartment."
carporn,39597z,cyanight7,3,Tue Jun 9 16:15:23 2015 UTC,A lot of cars even have engines designed to fall out so they don't smash into the the cabin in a crash.
carporn,39597z,plutobandits,3,Tue Jun 9 18:39:25 2015 UTC,That's true but it's still very important that the passenger compartment is intact. Many older cars buckle at the a-pillar and allow the dashboard to move inward towards the occupants.
carporn,39597z,gsfgf,8,Tue Jun 9 18:00:02 2015 UTC,"Often, it's the exact opposite.  Modern cars that crumple absorb a lot more force then the old steel tanks that can ""take a beating."""

Boost is monitored by a JB4 piggyback and AEM low frequency solenoid. Methanol is monitored by the JB4 as well. Fuel, timing, etc. are tampered with via backend flashes, which essentially involves reprogramming of the stock ECM.  The car is making around 560whp at 18psi on pump gas. I'm in the middle of tuning for methanol, but it feels like low 600's at around 22 psi on pump + meth. The car has room for much more, but I prefer higher timing and more conservative boost to make ""safe"" power.  I'm generally not a fan of methanol injection to ""mimic a higher octane fuel"", but the failsafes within the N54 tuning platform (JB4 and advanced OEM ECM) changed my mind."

carporn,395m9u,Cezetus,3,Tue Jun 9 12:40:10 2015 UTC,"Fun fact about Polonez:    An advantage of Polonez is its passive safety. In 1978, it was the only East European car built to pass U.S. crash tests. Crash tests were performed in 1994 according to EU safety regulations so that the Polonez could be exported worldwide. They proved the car to be very safe. The Caro 1.9 GLD hitting a concrete block (without an energy-absorbing metal cage) with 40% of the front at 50 km/h (31 mph) survived very well. All doors could be opened without any difficulty, there were no critical injuries for passengers, and no fuel leakage occurred.   That Little Trees air freshener, though..."

The SSC Ultimate Aero held the title of the fastest production car in the world, according to the Guinness World Records, from 2007 (when it was officially timed at 256.14 mph (412.22 km/h)) until the introduction of the Bugatti Veyron Super Sport in 2010. However, in April 2013, the Guinness World Records disqualified the Veyron's record time, and reinstated the Ultimate Aero as the fastest production car ever; this change was reverted just five days later.[2] The SSC Ultimate Aero was not sold with electronic driver aids such as ABS brakes or traction control, as according to Jerod Shelby, ""Early design philosophy on the car was to make it a driver's car. I wanted a car that you not only throttled with your right foot but at times you could steer with your right foot."""

carporn,3915dk,wrp1,5,Mon Jun 8 15:55:15 2015 UTC,"You have to drive/experience a ferrari first hand to truly grasp this. Anyone can say ""Oh I'll take the C7 over that overpriced italian horse bla bla"" but question is, how many have been in a ferrari or driven one? I for one can say the 458 would be the obvious choice, however to each their own as always."
carporn,3915dk,gamblekat,1 point,Mon Jun 8 16:57:44 2015 UTC,"I've driven the 458. It is a very, very nice car, but firmly within the realm of diminishing returns. I wasn't overly keen on the DCT either. I wouldn't fault anyone for buying it if the extra $150k is nothing to them, but it's not like it's in a completely different level of car-dom than a C7."
carporn,3915dk,Dunkshot32,4,Tue Jun 9 03:14:18 2015 UTC,"I think the DCT is great, and there's alot to be appreciated with Ferrari. It is cheesy, but the heritage thing is kind of true. All ferraris come from the line of some of the best super cars on the planet. Ferraris are made for automotive enthusiasts and are made with passion and quality. If it was pick one over another, 458 all the way in my book!"
carporn,3915dk,Hi-rez,7,Tue Jun 9 05:51:44 2015 UTC,"I've had a chance to ride in both. The Z06 Corvette will manage to go toe-to-toe with the 458. Granted, the 458 will still probably win (and is an older car), but it's a surprisingly close call.   If you go Z06 to 458 (for a more apples to apples comparison), the two are very similar in terms of performance. I will also say this; the 458 does not live up to expectations in terms of the interior quality. It's not bad, don't get me wrong, but it doesn't feel as nice as it should for the price. If I spent that much on a car, I want my seat filled with endangered panda dang it!  They are different cars, and the 458 would still likely beat a Z06. But, the Z06 will put up a very good fight."

carporn,3915dk,TheSpreader,3,Mon Jun 8 19:54:53 2015 UTC,"A lot of commenters are saying the extra money buys a name and some luxury and not much else which I have to disagree with. Yes, money is spent on the name (Ferrari is very exclusive, part of the appeal is that there aren't many out there whereas I'll see 2 or 3 new corvettes a day without ever passing a dealership). But you're also spending money on the layout. The Ferrari is mid-engined which is much better for racing (which is why many suspect or at least hope Corvette will go to a mid-engine car for the next generation) and the engine itself has a flat plane crank versus the Corvette's cross plane crank which changes how the power is delivered among other things (The most noticeable of which is the sound). While this issue is generally more a matter of preference, the flat plane is seen more in racing applications and not many manufacturers use this (again going back to exclusivity). The materials on the Ferrari will be nicer, however, not necessarily better made. With the Ferrari, you can customize almost every aspect with Ferrari to create your own ""one of a kind"" car whereas with Corvette, you have your set option list and if you want anything other than that- do it yourself. You also get invited to Ferrari events where you get free merchandise, can learn to drive your car better with the help of professional Ferrari drivers on Ferrari's track, etc. Corvette has programs similar to this, but are much more limited and to my knowledge are not free.   All this being said, the Corvette is an amazing car and one of if not the best ""bang for your buck cars"" on the market, and is just a great car all around. Someone in the market for a Ferrari is not usually in the market for a Corvette though and if they are-it's not because the Corvette offers something better or anything like that, it's because they wanted a Corvette and could care less they already have a Ferrari."

carporn,3915dk,thebbman,6,Sat Jun 13 22:20:20 2015 UTC,"around a hundred or so horsepower. IIRC the 458 has ~562hp, the Corvette has 450. Whether that performance is worth an extra 200k is up to you. Especially when you can get a top of the line Z06, which I imagine will stomp the 458, for 100k"
carporn,3915dk,McHammered__,17,Mon Jun 8 16:16:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah but they're still different cars with a different driver feel to them. Corvette is front engine RWD vs the Ferrari's mid-engine RWD. You're also not getting a Ferrari when you buy a Corvette. Regardless of performance numbers, the Ferrari name still carries a certain amount of clout."
carporn,3915dk,spigotface,7,Mon Jun 8 16:43:24 2015 UTC,"The Ferrari also has an ultra premium interior, awesome noise dampening, and an electronics suit that actually makes the car faster on a track than without it. Sure, a Z06 Corvette is probably just as fast, and it costs a massive amount less, but... It just isn't quite as nice. Which one is better depends on what you care about: The niceness or the money."
carporn,3915dk,McHammered__,2,Mon Jun 8 17:53:33 2015 UTC,"That quality gap is nowhere near as large as it used to be though. Check out the interior of the current-gen Corvette. The seats were even designed by the exact same company that does Ferrari's seats.  458 Italia interior for comparison.  Honestly, if the Corvette didn't have the logo on the steering wheel and seats, most people would think that picture was from the inside of a Ferrari, not a Chevy."
carporn,3915dk,K3R3G3,1 point,Tue Jun 9 04:12:58 2015 UTC,"I know, and it's awesome. Your 100% correct. I have a C6 Corvette, and the big worry that Corvette Club guys have is that the C7 will be the last affordable corvette. The C7 is an amazing beast. I'd even call it a better value than the famous Miata. It handles just as pleasantly, it's interior is much nicer... And it has usable trunk space!   Honestly, this is what's killing Ferrari. They aren't about the bleeding edge of sportsmanship anymore. They're about simply being nicer than their competition. Nothing I said in favor of the Ferrari had to do with track time. At least, not unless you consider computer-driven times to be a meaningful thing. That's pretty sad, considering that Ferrari is a boutique sports car manufacturer.   The C7 Z06 does the same job as the Ferrari, but it does it with simple good design and intrinsic dynamics. The Ferrari needs electronics and torque vectoring to be fast. The C7 Corvette is fast simply because it was built fast. If I had to pick between the two, I'd take the C7 Z06. Hell, the basic C7 with the Z71 package is plenty enough for just about anyone, and we're talking Acura money for one of those."
carporn,3915dk,Kingofzion,4,Tue Jun 9 04:27:34 2015 UTC,"True, but it's not just about hp, 0-60, and track times. Many other factors which some will deem worthy for the extra dough. Also, I don't know whether the Z06 would ""stomp"" the 458."
carporn,3915dk,xcrackpotfoxx,4,Mon Jun 8 16:39:17 2015 UTC,"At this point of time it isn't 200K extra, since it is the old model. The new 488 gets you 661HP."
carporn,3915dk,Pancakewagon26,3,Mon Jun 8 19:38:40 2015 UTC,"You can make an extra hundred horsepower in the corvette for under $10k, I'm sure. You'd also get to do the work yourself, which is nice."

What if you like the powertrain of the Ferrari F12, but would like a different body around it?   Touring superleggera berlinetta lusso.  It’s a custom coachbuild car out of Italy and was designed to celebrate the Ferrari 166 MM Touring, but of course using aluminium alloys and carbon fibre. 5 will be made and the price is unknown, and it’s probably better that way. It shares its performance figures with the Ferrari F12: that means a Ferrari F140 FC engine producing 740 PS and 690 Nm torque, a 7-speed dual-clutch semi-auto flappy paddel gearbox and an aluminium space frame."

carporn,392jgg,Cbach7,1 point,Tue Jun 9 16:26:59 2015 UTC,Enjoy it.  I've had my 06 Elise since 08.  I've not had the hard top out of it's bag since I got the soft top (which is almost never on).  You learn quick how to get in and out easily...and your butt will develop the extra padding needed to compensate for the thin seats :)
carporn,38yzct,BleakSeason,26,Mon Jun 8 01:04:17 2015 UTC,There's just something about a red Lamborghini that gives me a boner. It's like it knows it's wearing the flag of its enemy and wears it with such a mean and aggressive demeanor. Almost like it just murdered a Ferrari and is now drenched in its blood.
carporn,38yzct,Apex89,9,Mon Jun 8 03:40:39 2015 UTC,"Ahahah, that's a great way to put it!"

carporn,38yzct,alexkid,2,Mon Jun 8 12:46:34 2015 UTC,"I feel like the name is supposed to mean there is something special about this one , like that skiier guys that has camo.   Is it the head lights on this one ? I can't tell"
carporn,38yzct,RouseHouse1013,10,Mon Jun 8 13:31:57 2015 UTC,"Nope, the headlights were not on. Nothing really special about it, rosso mars is just the name of the color."

carporn,38yzct,EsTwoKay,2,Mon Jun 8 05:27:29 2015 UTC,"Since this is OC, can you tell me OP why there's frequently that rainbow effect on headlights? Were you using a polarizer? Maybe it's the lighting but I don't think I've ever seen that in a picture I've taken. Not saying there's anything wrong with it though, it shows up in some really nice pictures."
carporn,38yzct,myepicdemise,3,Mon Jun 8 05:42:36 2015 UTC,"Yep, that happens because of the polarizer."
carporn,38yzct,hubert_shrump,1 point,Mon Jun 8 12:44:19 2015 UTC,I always thought that happens when a car is waxed over the headlights and light reflects off it in a certain way
carporn,38yzct,cpweisbrod,1 point,Mon Jun 8 13:31:11 2015 UTC,"lots of pictures will get this look just from the headlight itself, usually a polarizer brings this look out more though. I was just going to comment I wish I had a polarizer for my camera.  Might be my next purchase."

carporn,38yfpg,picklesgarage,1 point,Mon Jun 8 03:16:26 2015 UTC,"My dad had a chance to buy one in the mid-nineties by pure chance, we were on vacation driving down to Florida and a guy in north Carolina was selling his 1971 340 auto (burnt orange).  We just happened to drive by it and there was a for sale sign on the windshield.   The guy was going through a divorce so he needed to sell it quick, and my dad wanted it.  Paid 7 grand for it.  I grew up loving that car and still to this day want to own one someday.  2006 rolls around and it's crushed while in storage due to the building collapsing from the weight of snow/ice.  At the time the car was worth roughly 35 grand.  I still hope to own one someday"

I remember being captivated by the 4 square exhaust tips. It's odd but that was the styling element that really grabbed me. I thought it was incredibly cool. Still do.
carporn,38yfpg,acog,1 point,Mon Jun 8 16:01:04 2015 UTC,"Always love the look of the old Challanger, the only way it'd be better is being a convertible. Think it even has the shaker hood?"
