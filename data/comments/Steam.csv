See here: http://www.pcgames.de/Panorama-Thema-233992/Specials/Spiele-sind-keine-Filme-Interview-mit-der-Obersten-Landesjugendbehoerde-1112254/  I think this difference is unjust and should be fought. But that costs time and money."

I still wonder if we as gamers couldn't raise enough attention regarding this issue so that the law might be changed to allow for swastika usage for artistic purposes in videogames. If we could just get the publishers into the boat, we might just be able to achieve something?"

Steam,3dzj2l,yuv9,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:46:05 2015 UTC,"Comments on Steam profiles are used only as a positive rep system. There's no point in giving and discussing negative reps since the user moderates the reps himself. Deleting such reps won't ring a bell to Steam either. This isn't a dedicated reputation system, they're just comments. Only we traders use it for reps.  And to talk about exploits - you can't blindly follow any rep system. They can be all exploited. If you need to determine whether reps on user's Steam profile are legitimate, there are three basic rules to follow:   1) The number of reps - getting fake reps is easy. He can buy them, get them as rep for rep, or have dummy accounts for it. He can easily fake dozens of them, but what if he has hundreds or thousands of reps? Would he be really putting this much effort/time/money in it in order to scam you? Because once he do a few scams, he'll end up with reports on Steamrep and you should always look there. 2) Trustworthiness of individual reps - see the reps themselves and the people leaving the reps. Fake reps from dummy accounts and non-traders (bought reps) can be recognized very easily. Also, there should be a variety and creativity in the reps. Customers often write very nice and creative things there when they're very happy with your service. Fake reps are usually all general. 3) The timestamps - keep an eye on the time stamps, this is the most important one! Fake reps are often gained during a few days or weeks. This should always ring a bell. But what if they are spread over several years? Then you can hardly doubt them.   Also, basing trustworthiness of a trader isn't all about reps. It's also about him, his profile, activities and possible intentions. Such evaluation may get very complicated if needed - making large transactions or when money is included."

Steam,3e11ip,DougyAM,2,Tue Jul 21 05:11:35 2015 UTC,"I would suggest some of the paradox games:  Crusader Kings 2: A character driven emergent RPG experience that is pretty sedate at the lower speeds and can (and should be) paused frequently.  Europa Universalis 4: An Empire building experience with the same speed and ability to pause as CK2, you can in fact buy DLC for CK2 that will take your CK2 save and port it to EUIV so that you can basically continue your game into a whole other game.  Cities Skylines: An older Sim City styled game that is proving very popular since its release a few months ago. It has fantastic mod support that adds a lot of features to an already solid game. Being a city builder its pretty sedate on the lower speeds and you can really take your time and design the city to look how you want it to.  Other than that:  Football Manager: If you like Football (soccer) or even if you do not then FM can be very engrossing with its depth and emergent nature. The majority of the game is essentially a turn based experience (you go from day to day and deal with issues as they pop up like picking players for matches, handling new contracts, signing players etc.) with the rest of the game taking place on the match screen which is basically you watching your team with the tactics you have trained them in play their games (one at a time), these matches can be played at a variety of speeds and like some of the above examples the game can be paused to deal with stuff like injuries or switching tactics etc.  Typically a very experienced player who is on a roll can get through a season in about 24 hours. Newer players will take much much longer to do that and during particularly interesting times you can spend multiple days of real time on a single season. (with technically unlimited seasons to play as the game continually generates new players and staff to replace the ones that get too old and retire, some players have careers spanning hundreds of years).  Addiction to FM has been likened to crack, with documentaries and books written about how often it gets cited in divorce cases."

Steam,3dur5e,GotBetterThingsToDo,8,Mon Jul 20 04:39:02 2015 UTC,They were all just big circles with random places to take cover waiting for somebody to walk by. Survival was so much more fun than the rest of the game though.
Steam,3dur5e,madbuttery,4,Sun Jul 19 23:12:29 2015 UTC,It was so chaotic and that's why it was so damn fun.

Steam,3dur5e,squeaky4all,3,Mon Jul 20 05:47:51 2015 UTC,MW3 went on sale more than MW2
Steam,3dur5e,OldSchoolNewRules,34,Sun Jul 19 23:53:01 2015 UTC,They're all hackers.
Steam,3dur5e,2SP00KY4ME,103,Sun Jul 19 18:33:07 2015 UTC,"Same in MW2. I got to lvl 70 after 3 games, the hacking in the CoD games is insane, you basically have to hope that the hackers on your team is better than the hackers on the other team."
Steam,3dur5e,Drdres,50,Sun Jul 19 18:51:31 2015 UTC,"Black Ops 2 is the only CoD that (at least yet) doesn't seem to have this problem. I've yet to see a hacker in multiplayer or zombies, and I have 400+h in-game."

Steam,3dur5e,Saizou,3,Mon Jul 20 00:06:45 2015 UTC,This is pretty accurate going by my experience!
Steam,3dur5e,abusedasiangirl,5,Mon Jul 20 03:22:39 2015 UTC,When I used to play Cod 4 the most servers with active admins were relatively cheat free. Certainly no rage hackers as they got blacklisted instantly.
Steam,3dur5e,res_proxy,9,Mon Jul 20 01:19:36 2015 UTC,I wonder what a multiplayer fps would be like if you made every hack a default for everyone?

Some even have realistic mods like that found in Rising Storm, or even slow paced servers, where one can only move by crouching and have no killstreaks. I enjoy the game, brings back old memories.

Steam,3dur5e,WylldStallyns,6,Mon Jul 20 00:37:26 2015 UTC,"Pretty much. When you can get competitive fps games for $15 or less, nobody is going to pay $60 ($120 if you want the DLC map packs) for a game with a dead community."
Steam,3dur5e,Roselillya_Wanderer,9,Mon Jul 20 02:49:11 2015 UTC,TIL if there was only one COD game on PC It probably would have a pretty good player count.
Steam,3dur5e,xylotism,17,Mon Jul 20 02:15:10 2015 UTC,That's sad.  But maybe if they're losing money they'll try something completely new after Black Ops 3.
Steam,3dur5e,AstorSapolsky,68,Sun Jul 19 21:20:00 2015 UTC,Advanced Warfare was them trying something new! The exosuits changed up the gameplay in a fantastic way.
Steam,3dur5e,godcheese,4,Sun Jul 19 22:06:10 2015 UTC,"The Exosuit gameplay would be great if their hitreg responded to the movement better. Its part of what makes lasers so OP is they have a wider hit area than the bullets... so cutting people down who were constantly air-dashing wasn't an issue. Lasers and Wall of Gunfire gunmods like the Speakeasy were the best counter to the atrocious air-dash hitreg... they also attracted the most ""noob"" comments because of this.   That said... I had fun with it for a while. Now I pretty much just play Black Ops 1 since that had the most fun maps to me."
Steam,3dur5e,TheGuthar,3,Mon Jul 20 07:02:57 2015 UTC,They have been working on the CoD game set to be after BO3 for 2 years already. They have 3 dev teams. So I doubt it will change next year.

Steam,3dur5e,BoogerSlug,4,Mon Jul 20 03:42:29 2015 UTC,Is that 1000 people playing Black Ops single player?
Steam,3dur5e,ITuckerz,5,Mon Jul 20 01:28:29 2015 UTC,Zombies is part of the singleplayer so thats probably why.
Steam,3dur5e,Dryy,2,Mon Jul 20 03:00:10 2015 UTC,Zombies is separate from both singleplayer and multiplayer.
Steam,3dur5e,ITuckerz,2,Mon Jul 20 11:39:44 2015 UTC,Not in black ops 1. The single player is combined with zombies.
Steam,3dur5e,Dryy,2,Mon Jul 20 20:45:32 2015 UTC,"Ah, my mistake then. I thought it had the same concept as BO2."
Steam,3dur5e,Lackest,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:36:51 2015 UTC,I'm not sure. Is zombies part of multiplayer or singleplayer? Because that may be zombies.

Steam,3dur5e,swartkrans,23,Sun Jul 19 18:32:28 2015 UTC,So what's a good multiplayer FPS game on steam that isn't CoD or CS:GO?
Steam,3dur5e,momomo544,68,Sun Jul 19 22:15:15 2015 UTC,"I'll second Insurgency. I'll also throw out Red Orchestra 2, Heroes of Stalingrad or Rising Storm, both are good.   ARMA 3 is fucking supreme if you like that kind of game. Very niche crowd, but great if thats what you like. Having friends or a group that plays also makes it funner."
Steam,3dur5e,Jack_Attack519,17,Sun Jul 19 22:53:46 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah. Love me some realistic FPS.  I got RO2 at the steam sale and gave my brother one of the 3 day passes. We played for 6 hours straight, took a 1 hour break and then played for another 3 hours. And then we played more the next day. He said that it reminded him of how much he loved RO1 when it first came out and it's one of his favourite FPS games now.  I also second ArmA 3. There's a lot to do, whether you play the campaign, download missions from the steam workshop, play multiplayer online or with friends or even screw around in the editor. I've spent so many hours just fucking around in the editor. Plus it has lots of mod support and the community is great for the most part.  Insurgency is really good too, but I haven't played it as much. All the games you reccommended are great!  Edit: added more text to arma 3 cause why not"
Steam,3dur5e,jayman9696,15,Sun Jul 19 23:19:48 2015 UTC,Taking a break for 1 hour. What are you some sort of casual?
Steam,3dur5e,Jack_Attack519,7,Mon Jul 20 00:54:37 2015 UTC,"Only casuals eat!  But on a more serious note... yeah, we're massive casuals because we only played on empty servers with bots and as soon as a player joined we'd get wrecked..."
Steam,3dur5e,momomo544,2,Mon Jul 20 02:03:44 2015 UTC,"I've got 45 hours in the game (Its a lot for me, I play less than I like) and I still get wrecked in the PvP servers.   Sniper is my favourite class though, just set up somewhere with a good view on the point if you're defending or chill next to a MG and give him suppressing fire and countersnipe."
Steam,3dur5e,Jack_Attack519,3,Mon Jul 20 04:13:43 2015 UTC,"Yeah ever since the COD1 days my brother has prided himself in being an expert marksman with the k98 so we basically just go rifleman or sniper and pick people off from a distance, spamming the taunts as we go."

Steam,3dur5e,Moncho_,25,Sun Jul 19 22:25:02 2015 UTC,Insurgency.
Steam,3dur5e,Compizfox,15,Sun Jul 19 22:32:29 2015 UTC,"BF4, Insurgency or TF2, depending on what you want.  BF4 is most similar to CoD of the three, but with more realistic weapon handling, bigger maps, vehicles and better graphics.  Insurgency is very realistic. Think of it as a combi of Counter-Strike and Red Orchestra.  TF2 can be very team-based and tactical but its style is casual. Although pretty old, still very fun.  Natural Selection 2 was another one I really liked but unfortunately its player base is slowly dying out."

Getting weapons is always nice but ALL of them can be had with gameplay and all starter weapons, but maybe a few, are among the best in game anyway. The only things you can only get with cash are cosmetics like decals, armors (no effect on hitbox nor HP), and camos.   Starting out will be rough, though the community is is more than willing to help anyone that askes. Just look for an outfit and ask for help, the game isn't that good at teaching the player."

First one is to go to the game's store page and press the community tab, then at the top it says the current player count.  Second option is going to steamcharts.com and checking out the game there, which gives a more detailed insight.  Hope it helped!"

Steam,3dur5e,3rdAccoCuzIforgotPW,7,Mon Jul 20 07:13:09 2015 UTC,I think Cod 4 still has a lot of players but it doesn't come up in these stats because most people play it off steam
Steam,3dur5e,Pete_Venkman,26,Sun Jul 19 23:26:49 2015 UTC,"That is a shame, I really like AW. It was the first CoD I bought since MW3, and I have had loads of fun with it."
Steam,3dur5e,SAXTONHAAAAALE,16,Sun Jul 19 22:50:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah I dug it too, unfortunately I never really got a chance to try out most of the multiplayer modes because the low player base meant almost every game was TDM or FFA. Or that lucky dip mode but that was still just a couple of extra random options.  Still don't regret buying it though, I enjoyed the single player and got enough fun out of the multiplayer to make it worth the purchase."
Steam,3dur5e,Pete_Venkman,2,Sun Jul 19 23:24:31 2015 UTC,"I wish I could say the same as you. Multiplayer refuses to work, always giving me an error saying the service is offline. It is what it is I guess"
Steam,3dur5e,DrStephenFalken,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:34:52 2015 UTC,"Ahh, that sucks mate. If it helps it's is a pretty bad port overall, the whole laser weapon thing was a huge fuckup and while the game wasn't crashing left right and centre, it had a few more than I'd expect from a long standing AAA series. It just happened to have enough good points to overcome all that.  If you're looking for something in a similar vein I can recommend Dirty Bomb. Just tried it out last night and had a blast, and it's free so even if you don't like the style or how the economy works you don't lose out."
Steam,3dur5e,Unleashing,2,Mon Jul 20 00:59:10 2015 UTC,The game wasn't bad but my issue was with MP. Pretty much because of the new jump aspect in every map every person would be at the highest point. So playing online would consist of spawning and running and jumping to the highest point where everyone was stuffed in a small area killing like crazy.
Steam,3dur5e,kennyminot,6,Mon Jul 20 03:56:40 2015 UTC,"This is just my opinion I feel like BO2 is not only a good pc port, but also a good 'balanced' cod. And it's still the most popular."
Steam,3dur5e,Treyman1115,5,Sun Jul 19 23:27:43 2015 UTC,"I think it would help if they actually discounted their games. Personally, I'd be willing to buy a CoD title for probably $10, but they never receive discounts that steep. Advanced Warfare, for example, is still selling for $60 on the Steam store, and according to the sales tracker, it's never dipped below $30. That's prohibitive for lots of people - certain franchises (Far Cry, CoD, Battlefield, and AC) are just never going to get more than $10-$15 out of me. Even Modern Warfare 3 (which was released in 2011) has never dipped below $20.  It's not that I don't have an interest, but it's kind of like a ""meh"" interest."

I would love to pick up Modern Warfare or World at War for like $5 each during a steam sale or hell even just a decently priced bundle and not $100 for like 5 games.

Steam,3dur5e,rahtin,2,Mon Jul 20 01:43:38 2015 UTC,I don't love COD nor do I dislike them but I'll play all of them that come out. From Ghost on it's like Tony Hawk games. The series has gone on so long and is the same thing over and over. That a new feature of game aspect isn't enough to keep anyone's attention. Making a series that long running new and exciting it extremely hard. I've always said that they should wait two years (minimum) in between releases. Instead of doing a new one every year.   Two years with all the DLC they offer is plenty of time to enjoy and tire of the game making a new release more exciting.
Steam,3dur5e,Kelsig,2,Mon Jul 20 04:01:06 2015 UTC,"I don't want them to try to keep it exciting. I just want it to work.

I know they're popular but I miss playing with strategy over trigger finger speed. This is why I can't wait for Squad to come out (joinsquad.net if you're curious). It's a slow paced teamwork version of COD and Battlefield. Heavily focused on realism and going to be on the Unreal Engine. I'm stoked."

I can point you to this tutorial which I used a little bit but also had to figure out a few things on my own. I did most of the tutorial up to the part where he sets it up to auto boot into limelight. For now i'm using script kitty on android to send the launch command to the Pi.

Steam,3dxnzg,patmanblu3,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:38:24 2015 UTC,Limelight pi is an application written in java for raspbian I believe. You just need to install and run it with the right command to launch big picture or any steam game.

The reason I don't use it otherwise is not its functionality (which is pretty good), but it takes ages to tab-in and tab-out of it AND the notifications are way to big. With Metro for Steam the notifications are almost invisible (half-transparent) but with Big-Picture they are taking about 1/8 of the screen and have glow around that is even bigger."

I have Kodi set up to be on my TV while I can use my PC for regular every day tasks.

Steam,3dwwui,PaleDolphin,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:01:42 2015 UTC,"My problem with that idea is that you can release a game and continue to update it afterwards. Look at Kerbal Space Program, it started as a game outside of steam, went to early access, went through alpha and beta, and it actually released.

Nor is there a limit to the amount of computers that can have the game at one time. The reason that you cannot install it is because a lot of PC games are not supported by Mac and can only be installed on windows. The missing install button is the indicator that that game cannot be installed on Mac.
Steam,3dzwg9,Onurubu,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:03:08 2015 UTC,"Hey! Thanks for your reply! But i very specifically remember being asked if i was installing on mac or windows becausse i thought cool, i can use it on my laptop as well."

Businesses sell their business on Steam, because they know it's in safe hands and they get their fair share of the pie of the sales.

If you mean the Steam Trading Cards (probably not, but I'll type this out just in case) only real way to do it is through Steam itself.

Steam,3ds0tf,AppleSauceApplause,22,Sun Jul 19 04:51:36 2015 UTC,"I am one of the game's early backers. Personally, the mods have been where it's at for me. Here's a few of the ones I like.   Side Stories: This one adds full-blown questlines to the game, giving you a reason to come back to certain planets. My personal favorite feature of this mod is how it adds the ability to ""buy a house"" from certain npcs. Basically, you give them 1000 Pixels after completing a few quests, and they give you a bunch of racial materials for building a house in their village/town. FrackinUniverse: This is the big one. A ton of new biomes, new mechanics (plant creation, gas and gasmasks, science, etc), and new planets. Use this in tandem with Side Stories for best results. ChokeLeFish: This one is not really to my taste, but I can see the merit in it. It makes the game more survival oriented and difficult, adding in hunger and other mechanics that have since been removed. It also adds few other original bits to the game, and even completely removes the original tutorial. Disregard all things I have said about CLeF (well, probably not that bit about it not being to my taste)! dsp2003 explained it better and corrected all of my misinformation. Retr0pack!: This one adds in a bunch of gameplay tweaks. I can't really describe what it does here, but it completely changes the feel of the game, in my opinion, for the better. FrackinMusic: Lastly, this one is a massive file, weighing in at 360 mb. If you are willing to use that space up, it adds 106 new songs to the game, livening the entire thing up. My biggest gripe with vanilla is the lack of songs, which is why I keep this pack in my modlist."

The funny part is how the developers who actually DO follow through on their promises are the ones who lose out the most. They're stuck actually making the game while other less scrupulous developers just leave their game in perpetual early access and start making other early access games, effectively doubling/tripling/etc their income based on the promises of games long forgotten (like Zero Sum Games).  Other awful game companies (like Chucklefish), just keep adding cheap visual ""updates"" that require little in the way of resources, so they can continue to show up in Steam's ""Recently Updated"" category and rake in money to spend on their game production sector (and not the actual game they're collecting money for)."

Steam,3ds0tf,Karkoon,4,Sun Jul 19 03:04:18 2015 UTC,It changed too much. It started as a WWI-esque game but over time it changed to become class based and the whole experience was different. And the building aspect became much less relevant.

Steam,3ds0tf,mud074,5,Sun Jul 19 03:17:01 2015 UTC,"I was talking about it pre-steam. It started as a real basic shooter with no classes, 1 gun (single shot rifle with a half second or so delay between shots) and a single, semi-random map with nothing but 2 camps and 2 intels to capture alongside the building mechanics. It was a very slow paced sort of game, where somebody was was really skilled could do incredibly well. Of course, being a free game, a lot of bullshit happened, people griefed, fucked around building away from the front lines, and hacked, but somehow that was a part of the charm. The game was populated enough with easy to set up servers that you could easily find a good one and the community early on was golden. It mostly consisted of people from the 4chan and Reddit threads about the game and was therefore far better than most other free games. There was also some great OC made in some fun threads about it.  Stuff changed, of course. As it became popular with 4chan and to a lesser extent, Reddit, the word spread, some popular youtubers made videos of it, and so on. The dev added more guns (including an SMG with the accuracy and range of the rifle but a far higher RoF) and the ability to create custom maps which changed the game completely, but it was still very fun. The community was not as comfy, but still pretty damn good with great mods (RIP zombie mod) and maps being made. At this this point, there would be around 25 highly populated servers at any one time and double that amount of less populated ones. Then, Jagex bought the game, completely changed everything about it, and made it P2P. That entire community was literally destroyed overnight. There are a few attempts at bringing back the game by using old versions, but none of them have nearly the amount of players or the community of the original. I in no way blame the original dev of the game, he was able to turn his free game that made no money into what I assume a decent amount of cash. However, I am sure you can see why I would be salty about it."

Steam,3ds0tf,Over9000Zombies,8,Sun Jul 19 04:44:37 2015 UTC,"This. All video games are influenced, to some extent, by previous games, whether it is the genre, art style, jokes, characters, game-play mechanics, etc.  It seems rather arbitrary to single out one particular aspect of a game and then declare that aspect is not available to others for inspiration. Let's not forget that Minecraft was not the first Voxel game, and was arguably a ""rip-off"" to some degree of previous games. Many games that are the most popular of their genre get the credit for inventing the genre, when they too borrowed heavily from others, Candy Crush, Angry Birds, League of Legends / DotA, etc. Its not enough to be first, what matters is who makes the best game (and I guess markets it best as well).  I guess my point is, I am glad video games (and all art) rip each other off. Nothing is made in a vacuum. Could you imagine video games that were made by a person who had never played or even seen a video game before?"
Steam,3ds0tf,Brandon23z,4,Sun Jul 19 07:20:06 2015 UTC,"But these aren't good rip offs. Like how you said League was inspired by other MOBAs, League is actually a good high quality game.  There is a difference between quality inspiration and cheap rip off.   Check the Google Play store. Every app has key words in the title. I've seen like ""Mine Five Craft Freddie's"".

Other than that, PC gamers now won't bother with buying Steam Machines since they can get much more for far less money. Console peasants will most likely just buy the cheapest one and then go back to their consoles, because their console sold with loss will most likely have higher performance than machine sold without loss."

Steam,3dx1as,KITTvsKARR,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:06:49 2015 UTC,"Steam machines are and will be marketed deceptively. A single machine could have multiple parts you can choose, but they will always pretend the lowest possible price will buy the best possible system right up until you hit the pay button. A database will be completly inadequate or misused by marketers.  Valve screwed up by working with 3rd parties. Valve has always failed with 3rd parties, assuming that unlike Valve and all other companies that exist the 3rd parties they work with don't want to make as much money as possible as fast as possible. 3rd parties are going to destroy the idea of a Steam machine with greed and lies."

Steam,3du3kg,liavt,5,Sun Jul 19 23:01:56 2015 UTC,"There is when it's just reselling assets. TT2 is an asset flip in of itself. it swaps it's map for another, and changes the clothes on a character. at this point, it is a complete ripoff.  There is nothing wrong with using the asset store, to a degree. but when your game is, hell, even over 50% asset store that makes no sense in the scheme of the game's theme, it's not worth selling. At all. Especially with such an obvious asset flip as TT2.  If you're going to sell something, put in some level of effort at the least.  TT2 is an amazing asset flip. It's flipping it's predecessor and reselling it. I mean, that is dedicated contempt for game design if I've ever seen it. Just because the developer created the asset packs doesn't mean this isn't asset flipping."
Steam,3du3kg,Taterdude,-3,Sun Jul 19 23:51:47 2015 UTC,"If you're going to sell something, put in some level of effort at the least.   Programming a game is a lot of effort. Don't deny talented people making games just because they are not an artist and programmer in one person. And it is very difficult and very expensive to get a good artist. So again, there is nothing wrong with using the asset store as long as the bought art fits together."
Steam,3dvzfv,fastykun,30,Mon Jul 20 00:07:52 2015 UTC,"Obviously I'm qualified to answer this, seeing as I've used Idle Master longer than literally anyone else in the world.  Due to a recent change made by Valve, cards won't start dropping for games until after you've had two hours of playtime in that game.  After that, the amount of time between each card drops varies from game to game.  It's something the game publishers/developers can set up themselves, but if they leave it as the default then it's approximately 25-30 minutes per card drop.  Since you earn half the number of the game's cards, rounded up, most games have 4 cards (sometimes more) that end up taking about 4 hours of gameplay to drop.  Of course, some developers have set their drop rate times to be ridiculously high.  For example the game Awesomenauts takes about 1.5-2 hours between card drops, and the game drops a total of 8 cards.  Add in the first two hours of idling time, and it could easily take 18 hours to get all of your cards for that game.  So the number of hours you would need to run Idle Master is completely dependent on the number of cards you have available, but I'd say on average you're looking at one card every 30 minutes or so once you get everything rolling."
Steam,3dvzfv,jshackles,10,Mon Jul 20 00:16:30 2015 UTC,"It is designed to get you trading cards from Steam games, games you may not even own over a period of time.   False, you must own the game to get drops. F2P games will require you to spend money to get any drops at all.   All games now require exactly 2 hours of idling before anything drops. This is to prevent card farming and refund abuse.   Drops rates are completely wild, some games will drop all your allotted cards within 1 hour after the initial 2 hour idling. Others will require upwards of 8 afters the initial 2 hour idling.   I have around idled 1200 games for all the drops. It took me about 5000 hours or a little over 8 months of idling when I'm at work, not home, sleeping, on vacation."

Firstly, members of the site are asked to create a profile when they join which includes things like timezone, when you normally play and even skill level - all of which help you find a closer match to what you're looking for in a gaming partner.  Secondly, our site allows members to rate and review each other. This means it's easy to see who is a good, friendly or knowledgeable player and who isn't. Higher rated members naturally get contacted more, so the site rewards being a ""good"" member.  None of this is really possible for you to find out from a random connection.  Hope that helps,  Lee (findgamingbuddies)"

I think its due to it lookin suspicious if a lot of money is taken from a credit card or multiple transactions occur over a short period of time.

The Australian refund policy is fucking absurdly anti-business when it comes to digital goods. Unless the developer can prove that the game is functioning on your computer properly, they must give you a full refund for the game if you claim it is not working. It doesn't matter if this occurs months after you have 100% cleared the game, it doesn't matter if your game is actually functioning fine, it they cannot prove it still works on your system it must be refunded. The amount of abuse that can occur here is astronomical.  Australia really needs to step up it's legal game in terms of dealing with digital goods. Being pro-consumer is one thing (and is good).

Combine that with a failure to account for the falling Australian dollar and the pending imposition of a 10% tax, and anything further will render Steam quite uncompetitive.  The same abuse could occur with physical games as well, and retailers are not, to my knowledge, plagued by refund requests. I worked for EB Games as a kid, and though their change of mind policy was certainly abused at times (school holidays saw a peak, because kids could easily complete a game in the seven days allowed by the policy), returns for defective and misleadingly advertised items were uncommon.  I'd be surprised if they were expected to give refunds to somebody who tries to run Crysis on a toaster, or who cites a game-breaking bug which nobody else has encountered in a popular game.   It would be interesting to know the basis of the claims for refunds which are the subject of this action, since they would give an example of what the ACCC regards as a legitimate claim."
Steam,3dtihx,S3V9,2,Sun Jul 19 22:59:26 2015 UTC,"This is indeed a very interesting evolution of events which i have been trying to keep up with, so many thanks to the OP for the update.  I think that based on what transpires with the Australian episode, it could potentially impact how Valve's TOS applies to the rest of the world, including refunds. But in my opinion, the Australian government needs to employ some external help in helping them to understand the discrepancies between a virtual good, like a game, compared to any other virtual or actual goods. You cannot expect Valve to agree to an unlimited time-frame for a refund on a game after it has been completed once or more, all trading cards farmed, achievements unlocked, etc. It is an open door to extreme abuse since anyone could recycle their completed/unused games and simply buy new ones. I think that an exception in Australian law needs to be amended for virtual goods, especially games.  The downsides to this struggle between the Australian government and Steam are further delays to AUD currency support and inevitable price hikes on all Steam games offered in Australia."

Steam,3dtihx,redwud,4,Sun Jul 19 09:51:16 2015 UTC,"Reading it just reminded me why I didn't go into consumer law!  I haven't read the Trade Practices Act in some time, but broadly Australian consumer law includes certain guarantees regarding goods. They include that the goods are fit for purpose, match the description and so forth.   Where that isn't met, the purchaser can seek a remedy from the retailer, including a refund or replacement.  Valve's stated policy that they would not provide refunds (which I think was conveyed to the people named in this case) is contrary to those rights.  Even their new policy goes further in some respects (allowing change of mind refunds, which aren't guaranteed under Australian law), the time limit is contrary to the guarantees.  Of course, Valve's argument is that Australian law does not apply, while the ACCC claims that since they are selling to Australians, they are conducting business in Australia and thus subject to the relevant legislation.  The short-term consequences, if ACCC is successful, could include financial penalties and a requirement that Valve publish an admission that they breached the law. They could also be compelled to offer the appropriate refund rights to Australian consumers.   More broadly, it could have an impact on other international online sellers. This may serve as a precedent, though I confess my ignorance of this branch of law.  Sorry, long answer for a quick question!"

Every piece of software you ever buy, unless a contract specifically states otherwise, has absolutely no requirement to ensure it's functionality when interacting with other pieces of software, or to ensure that the software doesn't break completely with OS updates.

If Adobe's Flash crashes people's computers and blue-screens them, or if Windows 10 breaks if you try to open the Start Menu, there's someone to hold accountable. Someone with an actual reputation people can go against. There's repercussions for their actions.  One big mistake can ruin any business, and that includes software developers. Admittedly I'd like actual EXAMPLES of softwares that ""can completely break the OS"", but either way.   If you want a game example, look at Arkham Knight. Game released and was shitty on many computers. So much so the developer/publisher (can't remember which) recommended you return it. If someone who releases a product does a shoddy job, and charges money for it, they are most times to be held accountable.  Yet who do you hold accountable if a skin, or a hunger mod, or whatever, breaks? The mod developer? How do you ""hold them accountable"" if they've already spent the money? Or if more than enough time has passed if we're going with the 48-hour window?  Why does a mod developer have to take responsibility over Microsoft? Microsoft is a multi-billion dollar company. They're focused on sales. Mod developers who would charge for their... Mods are, in most cases, obviously not in dire need of money immediately depending on the amount they charge.  They can afford to lose sales, in most cases. Because again, it's not like with a huge business where you'd have to start from scratch. It's pathetically easy to do so, and that's why /u/VickyShep was talking about mods that way. Any software developer has things to lose. Other than an already built-up reputation (Which you don't even have to sack because you could just make the mod on another account), you don't have anything to lose by releasing a garbage mod you don't support but force people to pay for."

You seem to have missed the fundamental point of my post. Every fucking thing you are spouting applies exactly the same to video games as a whole. I could replace the word ""mod"" with ""video game"" and vice versa and your post would be just as nonsensical as it is now. You are creating a mythical divide between mod authors and game devs that simply does not exist. This last quote is the perfect example of that. Why in the flying fuck do software developers have to lose that mod authors don't? They both can (But don't always have) reputations, they both sunk time and money into the product. There is absolutely no difference between an indie game developer and a mod developer. None.   If you are going to continue building arguments on the nonsensical idea that there is a massive difference between game devs and mod devs, you better damn well explain what the difference is.

Steam,3dtk2c,ShinoAsada0,8,Sun Jul 19 15:15:26 2015 UTC,"First of all, I think you're being a little overly-harsh here. That doesn't discredit the validity of your post, but jeez... :l   Are you claiming that mod authors cannot have a reputation? Are you claiming that random indie game dev #324234 has a reputation to speak of? Are you even thinking this bullshit through before posting it?   Mod authors can have a reputation. It's just that most times it's through one or two very popular mods, and in rare cases more than that. The SkyUI and SKSE devs come to mind, as do those that made things like weather mods or follower mods or what-have-you.   Similarly, I'm sure very few people know who KnuckleCracker is, as a game-development studio. But here's the problem: A game developer who rips people off can also be news. Especially if a gaming-related place like PC Gamer or something writes about their game and reviews it. Hell, even Steam reviews has some merit for games. But mods don't have that. There's only a page where people can post comments. That might suffice, but little reporting is done otherwise, and I doubt it'd be done even for bigger mod developers. Even indie games have their niche crowds. But mods are a niche inside a niche.   The mod developer. Are you dense? How do you hold indie game devs accountable?    Despite the insult, you hold indie game developers accountable by removing their game from Steam. If it's just a cash-grab game like I'd be concerned some mods are, then it can be taken down and people who have the ability can ask for refunds, which I guess will come from Steam. The worst that happens is a developer's game is shit on. But if the game is trash, and the developer tiny, either the game will be so bad people will hear about it anyway (That Gender-Bending game or Bad Rats come to mind), or it will sink into obscurity as a bad game that isn't hilariously bad. If the game is taken down for being too shit, the developer must pay another $100 on another account to keep an unmarred reputation, or try to move on despite that. Mod developers aren't restricted at all, and can do as they please.   Why in the flying fuck do software developers have to lose that mod authors don't? They both can (But don't always have) reputations, they both sunk time and money into the product.   The shitty sword skin for Skyrim says otherwise. Many software products that AREN'T games at least have a reason to be charged for, especially if you really want it. It probably took time to develop and test and make sure it was compatible with multiple OS', ironing out bugs, etc. I mentioned this already, but if Adobe Flash or Windows 10 started crapping out on a fuckton of computers, their reputation would go down the tubes.  Again, Arkham Knight. Developer got caught out and told people to get refunds. There's accountability because people actually know about the shit the developer's done and can keep that in mind for the future. But a mod developer can easily make another account and upload more mods that they can charge for.  Games are not mods. Software is not mods. Mods are additions, modifications, to already-EXISTING software. Mod developers are not held to the same standards because they aren't making a game or a piece of software. A person who does art designs for a game is not MAKING the game in and of themselves.   People who make NPCs or models for Skyrim, as mods, have no obligation to deliver a 100% working product that they have to update. A developer who wants people to actually play their game, which took them time and money to make compared to a character which was already basically coded into the game, will fix it up. And update it.  ""Oh but developers can do that!"" But again. If they go through Greenlight, they have to go through the WHOLE Greenlight process and get their game noticed. It costs $100. For developers, it only works ONCE. The same cannot be said for any mod because of how pathetically easy it is to get mods onto the Workshop that people can play and use.  I do agree that the very small-time indie developers don't have much to answer for similarly to mod developers, but it's the same problem as the guys who made Big Rigs: Off the Road Racing and then War-Z or whatever it's called now. Their reputation followed them.  Again, much smaller indie devs may not have heard that problem. But they already paid $100 to Steam to have their game put on there. Unless they want to make another half-assed game and spend another $100 on Steam, they're going to be stuck with a reputation that will continuously bring them worse and worse publicity just for money.  Mod developers don't have that problem. That's why they're different. It costs them NOTHING to put a product on Steam, and they have no reputation to uphold at all, whereas even indie devs have like 5 people who bought their game, played it, and then poorly reviewed it.  There's no quality control with mods. ANYONE can put up a paid mod. Greenlight at least helps to eliminate a good portion of the garbage from Steam by forcing people to pay $100 and then making the community vote on the game.   There's more in place to stop shitty indie devs. Nothing in place to stop mod devs."

Mods aren't and can't be checked as thoroughly, as modders don't have such resources available. Even if their paid mod does get called out as being bugged and causing problems, nothing is stopping a modder from ignoring those issues or changing his name and uploading new things under a new signature.

Games created by parties not associated with any company usually aren't that big and are often indie titles. The titles we're talking about are one of the biggest around.    Indeed, software development is software development. Yet modders, in this situation, could be paid for their mod and then be able to easily move away if any problems with said mod arise - which isn't difficult, as official game updates often break mods and modders don't have any help from official developers, they don't know what's exactly going to be affected and when is it going to happen. Like it has already been said, official game is expected to work with official additional content. Nobody expects mods to work perfectly and there are no obligations, as modders can easily change names to avoid bad reputation, unlike the companies. Just try to imagine Ubisoft (or any other badly seen company) shutting down and re-opening just to reset their negative score.  Good mods surely deserve money. But bad mods don't. If paid mods were an official, full thing then why do modders don't have the same obligations and consequences as companies do?  EDIT: There's also this problem with overpricing.

They are entitled, as a member of our society, to be able to charge any amount of money they want for their legal and honest work. They are not entitled, under any circumstances, to have people actually buy that product. That is up to the consumer and the consumer alone."

You are not required to release an update for your game if a windows or driver update breaks the game. It would be nice, sure. And their sales should certainly suffer greatly (Or stop all together) if they don't maintain the product.  But no other form of software, unless you sign a contract specifically stating otherwise, is forced to guarantee that it will work with all versions of windows and various drivers.

This is true for video games breaking when your OS or drivers are updated. This is true for mods breaking when your game is updated.

It's like trying to find a car on Craigslist that's not ridiculously over priced, you're just not going have a easy time finding people offering content that's fair in its value. Most Skyrim mods are way too simple and poorly done or unfinished to even consider worth money. Charging 3 or 5 bucks for Falskaar? I wouldn't mind that. Charging 8 bucks for near useless armor that clips like a motherfucker is plain stupid, especially if the only reason I download it was to see what it looked like."
Steam,3dtk2c,Spilcam,-8,Sun Jul 19 11:25:06 2015 UTC,"Explain to me how this phenomena is not an issue for games themselves on steam, but will somehow be an issue for mods?  Unless you think it is somewhat of an issue with games on steam as well, at which point you need to get the fuck over it because it is a minority of games that overprice themselves.  People being able to overcharge money for their work has never been a valid justification for preventing them from selling it. If there is a market for X mod, and someone develops a mod to tap into that market but overprices the shit out of it, the mod is going to sell like shit. Next thing you know, a (likely better, since they actually understand basic economics) developer will come by and create another mod for X, this time without absurd overpricing.  The kicker? Every single instance of ""mod"" in the above paragraph can be replaced with ""Game"" and still be perfectly accurate. Stupid people over price stuff no matter what they are selling, and in the end they will be punished when a superior product appears that is sold at an appropriate price."
Steam,3dtk2c,ShinoAsada0,3,Sun Jul 19 13:25:45 2015 UTC,"I'm gonna get a bit philosophical here.  Do you know why people charge for games, like anything else? It's because it costs time, time which could be spent earning money elsewhere, and money is also required for living. You're probably thinking ""Of course! That's obvious!"", but that's the truth. People charge for games, in most cases, out of necessity. It is possible to over-charge, but we need to face facts here.  A majority of the games that over-charge, are games that already charge less than $15. Why? Because there is not enough content, or replayability, to justify the current price. It's the job of both the consumer and the seller to settle on a price, and therefore the consumer has a ""say"" in buying it or what-have-you.  The reason behind a game not being worth it at a certain price is that the game does not feel like it took as much development. The person who made it did not spend ""enough"" time on it to justify its current price, at least not to the consumer. And the lower the price for a game that releases is, the more chance there is that the person spent less time on the game.   The less time spent on something, the less it's worth, because the time spent is a good gauge for cost. Games that are less than $5 are often-times worth little more than a brief distraction. There are some gems hidden in there that can be quite good, with a lot of replayability or just length in general. And it isn't to say that there can't be games made quickly with a lot of effort put into them. But most times you charge for time, only maybe considering effort.  Now apply this to mods. Skin mods that are charged for, at their core, never worth the price because someone spent 5 minutes creating a model that you won't even see unless you play third-person, unless it's a weapon in which case you might be able to see how ugly it is. ""Oh well then don't charge for it! The consumers will help with that!"" Keep that in mind as we move on.  There are also other mods. Like Midas Magic. Midas Magic Gold, the paid addition of the mod, added 25 spells to the game. The base modpack was free and had 50+. How much was charged? Either $5.99 or $6.99. Can't remember which. For, effectively, 25 spells. ""Well the price can be decreased! Competition will come along! Etc.""   Now here's my point. Arguing that a developer of anything could lower the price for what they're charging basically makes one of the main points behind making software or ANYTHING null. Yes, someone can still charge for their work. But the idea that they deserve more than a certain amount for something that does NOT cost that much time or effort is ridiculous, and that's what bothers me about some people (Not all) charging for mods.  Unless a person is trying to make a living off of mods, which is ridiculous in its own right because it isn't a job and you're not actually developing a game, just content for a game. You have no job security. So the only other idea is that someone is making mods to either supplement their current income, or because they're a greedy fuck who thinks that their 5 hours in the TES Creation Kit or whatever is worth more than a couple cents.  Unless people are making a Falskaar or a Skywind, they don't have much reason to charge more than a few dollars for their mod, other than greed. Unless they change how the system works, you'll only get money once the mod has made a certain amount. For mods that charge less, that's going to be a while. They can't support themselves off of something that unreliable. Even if it's to help pay for college shit or something.  I am not saying people are not allowed to make money off their mods. I'm saying that in some cases, arguing that they ""deserve"" money for it is baffling. Because the money they ""deserve"" is either going to end up being very little, not as much as they wanted because of competition, or be income they receive from something they barely worked on. I'm sure people will still say ""It's people's content and they can charge what they want."" But that seems like a cop-out to me, and I don't know if I buy that. Offering the ability to charge for mods just seems like it would make people (Like, who was it, the SkyUI guys?) be more inclined TO charge for mods just for money. Not money that they need because the development takes them away from a real job or something. And the time it takes for them to get the money means it isn't immediately necessary, so it'd feel like they're doing it just because. They have the ability to make content free but instead charge for it because they can. Which isn't the basis of charging for things in the first place, as far as I'm aware."

You making shit up is getting old, fast.   Game developers can always make games. New games. They can update old ones if they want.  Mod developers who make paid content, will only have that content be popular so long as the game it's from stays popular and lucrative enough for them to do so. Like, Skyrim is four years old at this point, and I'm pretty sure people are still updating their mods. But what about older games? Once the revenue flow slows down, where do you go from there? Do you try to mod other games? At least game developers can work on other projects, or try to find other work.  That's not really the case for mod developers, though. Yeah, I understand that game developers CAN go bankrupt because their games aren't successful. But they at least have a background that can get them another job. What do mod developers have? This is less me actually challenging it, and more me being ignorant of what mod developers have actually gotten jobs, when the only things they've modded in are new spells or skins, or some other shit like that.

Stop pretending that games cannot be made with a piss poor amount of effort by people whom have no idea what they are doing. Especially in a modern setting, where things like Unity and UE4 exist. Learning how to use those tools to create a basic game is just about as hard as learning to use something like Maya or blender.

If that price is too high, do not buy the game at all. It's pretty damn simple.  Secondly, paid mods is nothing but a benefit for the modding scene. Those who want to stick to free and open mods as a hobby can do just that, just like free and open software development has existed since the dawn of computers, despite software always been a generally paid-for product.  But monopolization of mods allows those who don't want to or cannot do it for free to also move into the market. Things like Portal:Mel or Falskaar will cease to be one-off mods and will become more more normal, since they can be fully funded and supported by people whom are actually paid for their work, instead of being made in a few peoples free time over many years.

Steam,3dpi0v,superted125,9,Sat Jul 18 11:01:09 2015 UTC,Honest question from someone who hasn't heard of it before: What makes it better? Does it do anything more than Google Authenticator?   [edit] Just saw /u/gellis12's response below which details some of it's features

Steam,3dpi0v,Godwine,2,Sat Jul 18 13:28:49 2015 UTC,Can I use a mobile app and desktop app at the same time? Accessing my email at work can be problematic for 2FA.
Steam,3dpi0v,benjick,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:56:44 2015 UTC,"Yes, it's a chrome app which is synced with your account.  http://i.imgur.com/aG864i3.png"
Steam,3dpi0v,Gundato,2,Sat Jul 18 23:38:17 2015 UTC,"In all fairness, all those features can be obtained, in a much more secure way, through the use of Keepass2 with the appropriate plug-in.  Keepass is a tool to access an encrypted database containing passwords (and, with the plugin, OTP tokens). It supports all major OSes (including Android) and is 100% offline (unless you choose not to be), which is great. Which is a good idea to use, even if not for your 2FA needs, as it allows you to easily have a unique password for every site you don't have to regularly type the password for (for those, do a memorable password)  Combine that with something like Spideroak for the cloud backup and sync. Which is actually superior to having the app/system do it as Authy knows what they are backing up, whereas Spideroak just sees bytes.  And, because the tokens are in your keepass database, you don't really have to worry anywhere near as much about losing your phone. Rather than go through the hassle of authorizing a new device, you just open the keepass database on whatever computer you have access to and generate the OTP. And, if you use the spideroak route, you can ALSO get the database off their servers in the event your house burns down with your phone, laptop, and whatever inside. Because just because your life is in ashes doesn't mean you don't want to have access to your list of favorite videos on pornhub."
Steam,3dpi0v,gellis12,34,Sat Jul 18 15:59:21 2015 UTC,"I used Google Authenticator a while ago, but I've since switched to Authy. It's backwards-compatible with all Google Authenticator tokens, but with a shitload of extra awesome features.   It'll back up your tokens for you so that if you lose your phone, you still have all of your accounts It'll sync your tokens across any device you have, so any tokens that you add on your phone will be accessible from your tablet. It can show all of your tokens in a Notification Centre plugin It'll wirelessly connect to your computer, so you can just click a button on your computer and copy the code to your clipboard instead of getting out your phone and opening an app to read and type it in. TouchID app protection. Google Authenticator will show your codes right away when you open the app, but you can make Authy require your fingerprint or a password first.   Plus, they've also made their own kind of tokens which make longer codes, which make your accounts even more secure. Humble Bundle uses this, and the code that it generates is 7 numbers long instead of 6.  Edit: Also, when you connect Authy to Humble Bundle, you just need to type in your email address to make codes show up on your phone. You don't even need to scan a QR code!"

Steam,3dpi0v,MxBluE,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:08:25 2015 UTC,"The primary advantage of 2FA is that if your computer is compromised, the attacked can't access data behind a 2FA system, as you need a phone input of some sort to do it. This means your phone would also have to be hacked for the system to be completely compromised.  As for how weak it can go, I'd say it can go to a point where the app is simply a button press instead of a code entry (think WPS on routers). If a random 2FA key is generated on login failure, even getting a single digit 2FA key right by brute force becomes quite difficult (I cbf'd doing probability to prove it atm :P).  I don't understand exactly what a PIV is, but my guess is that it's a usb device which stores the tokens? Well, IMO, it's not as secure unless it requires a physical press to load the tokens, as otherwise, it's another device which is already connected to the system.  Actually, considering that last sentence I typed, a phone isn't as secure as a PIV which would require a physical press, as a phone connected to the same WiFi network as the PC compromised leaves a large room for furthur compromisation.  Anyway, I think I'm rambling on now, so I'll stop :P"

They are using a standard TOTP (RFC 6238) implementation to generate the hash, but varies by encoding into a different alphanumeric string than GA. Steam uses a custom 26 alphanumeric alphabet. This, I assume, is to keep it compatible with their existing email authentication scheme.  SteamGuard has been added into the latest version of WinAuth so could be included in any other mobile implementation, if they don't decide to change it."

I tried putting in my recovery code, and I got a message saying you can't use the recovery code, you have to use the most recent auth code you generated. Except, I have never yet needed a code, so I have no code to enter. On another note, why in the fuck would I have or keep the last-generated code? Am I supposed be writing them down every time I use one? That is so incredibly fucking dumb. Did they even test this feature?

I get its a weird solution but its better than this shit. We already have like Mail & Phone authentication and frankly I no longer dare to get authentications on my phone because I'm afraid it'll break."
Steam,3dpi0v,SnipingNinja,6,Sat Jul 18 06:25:08 2015 UTC,"Authenticators are not that bad. Usually you get a recovery password or other method to access the account in case you can't use your phone. If you write them down somewhere safe, then you're fine.  The biggest advantage of the authenticators is that even if a son of a bitch somehow finds your password, he still can't access your account. And in some accounts that's of the utmost importance, like your main e-mail where you receive all the reset password messages, or Steam, that holds thousand of dollars worth of games and tradable virtual stuff.  Lots of services uses the ""Google Authenticator"" system. For those I recommend the Authy app. With it, you can use more than one device to generate the passwords, even your PC, so it's way harder to lose access to a site because you don't have your cellphone in hand. Authy is so handy that you end up getting bothered when a service offers a non-Google-Authenticator authenticator, like Steam just did. ಠ_ಠ"
Steam,3dpi0v,__Miguel_,2,Sat Jul 18 08:20:11 2015 UTC,"Authy is so handy that you end up getting bothered when a service offers a non-Google-Authenticator authenticator   Or Microsoft. Their implementation does allow for multiple devices to provide confirmation for authentication purposes, but I still want everything under one single app.  Edit: Actually, scratch that. Microsoft accounts are also compatible with Google Authenticator, and thus with Authy :D"
Steam,3dpi0v,Alenonimo,2,Sat Jul 18 09:46:50 2015 UTC,"BTW Microsoft authentication is nice, it sends you a approve/deny notification, I like it, maybe everyone can make that standard and authy can build it in."
Steam,3dpi0v,bloodstainer,2,Sat Jul 18 12:14:47 2015 UTC,"Oh, I know. And I very much like that implementation. Though I prefer to have a single app, so I gave that up.  I do second the approve/deny notification implementation on the other platforms, though. However, it seems like Authy might have something similar going on. Haven't really tested it, but I've got a few notifications about logins, today.  Didn't really follow them, though, as I was busy migrating everything from Google Authenticator and Microsoft Account to Authy and to several devices. Too much going on at the same time... lol"
Steam,3dpi0v,iTrey,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:49:53 2015 UTC,"Facebook is compatible too, by the way. They want you to use their app, but you can use Google Auth or a similar like Authy.

There's a section dedicated to Mobile Authenticator issues, and when you get locked out, you use the recovery code there to reset the authentication to use the normal e-mail codes, and start over.  Also, you can generate secondary one-time authenticator codes, for when you don't have access to the phone/authenticator app. Of course, you need to remember to generate those codes before something happens and you get locked out, which might be an issue.  Valve should make you generate one-time codes when you set the Mobile Authenticator. It has caused quite a few issues so far. Also, the setup process (or the code input window) should clearly state how to remotely remove the authenticator... They have FAQs for that, but it gets messy.  Or, even better, they should let us use the Google Authenticator authentication, since that way we can actually have several devices as authentication providers."

Steam,3du7k8,EinfachKatka,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:06:35 2015 UTC,"Okay, I'm not the most qualified person to comment because I haven't tried SteamOS first hand, but here's what I got.   Steam machines are a good value for money only for those who can't build a PC themselves. It's portable, decently powered, and it is more expensive than what individual components would cost you (Any Variant of Steam Machine Early lineup). Again, making one won't get your a compact form factor necessarily.  Yes, any regular PC runs Linux or Steam OS for that matter. Go ahead and get started with your build.    Like I said, Pros for making your own build: - Cheaper than prebuilt variants - Full control over the specs you want - Easy Upgrades*  Cons: - Smaller form factor might be difficult to achieve, don't take my word for it though. There are small cases around, but not console sized (Those are for HTPCs). - No singular warranty for the whole thing - Buying and building and then if something goes wrong is on you. Also, you'd have to claim individual warranty for the faulty parts.  *I'm not sure if you can manually upgrade the prebuilt Steam Machines without voiding warranty.    As far as I know, Steam OS uses some proprietary graphics drivers. Those aren't open source, but they are totally free. You can check out the early test builds and people using them on Youtube. There's decent ones around. Just google ""Steam machine Hands on"" or stuff like that. You can then decide if it's easy or not.  But Steam OS directly boots into Steam Big Picture mode, and the UI is refined and not a hassle to work with on a controller for most part . TVs are good, but there's an elementary difference between a TV and a moniter. TVs are designed for larger viewing distances, while a moniter is something you sit quite close to.  You'll be good with a TV for most part, if it's gaming and movies/shows only. However, TV is not a moniter replacement since you can't do much apart from regular browsing that includes text, it gets uncomfortable.   I hope it helps."

There are alot stuff to talk about but I will try to make it quick  Enhanced Steam- This is plugin for browsers that give you alot of cool features.

Skins- You can download skins for the client (there are a lot of good ones). If you want more info go to the skin section here   Games and Bundles: If you are beginner in steam you would need games. If you don't have something you are looking for I would suggest you check out bundles (check the bundles section in the last link). Bundles are usually group of 6-8 games in ridiculous prices (Might be 4$ for 8 games that worth 100$ together). Usually Humble bundle have the best bundles but other bundles are good. They are also sometime doing giveaways for free games like here at the bottom of the page. (If you find it hard to track all the bundles just join one of many bundle trackers group (I can link if you want me to).  If there is game you are looking for IsThereAnyDeal would be your friend.

I'd expect it to be something that affects the internet, such as drivers for your router, Hamachi, Evolve (or EvolveHQ, same thing). Try starting up your computer in safe mode and start CS:GO. If it's still giving you the error, it's either drivers or your router.  If it does end up being not the drivers/router, it's probably because of hamachi/evolve. In which case you just want to bridge the connections with your ethernet/lan cable. By going to your network and sharing center, go to manage adapter settings or something like that."

When you're done you might want to backup this file:   <STEAM>/userdata/<UID>/7/remote/sharedconfig.vdf  This file should store categories in case you lose them for some reason."

Difficult platforming that you get to watch yourself grow better at slowly. Enough content to be a full adventure without too much to make the levels feel like anything more bloated than a precise puzzle.   The Elder Scrolls 3: Morrowind - Role-playing games have done the individual elements of this game better, but Morrowind captures something that very few others can manage: You actually feel lost. Like an outlander in a country where they are not wanted. Plus, this game has a thriving modding community, even over ten years later. Want the game to look better? Want every NPC to be in-depth and interesting? Someone in the last decade has made everything you could want in an rpg.   I Have No Mouth, And I Must Scream - I was pretty excited to see this game on Steam. It's an older game, but it's a doozy. You play as one of five survivors kept alive by the last computer on earth for his entertainment as he tortures you for eternity. Yes, just like that one part from Fallout 3.   Puzzle Quest - What? A casual game on here? Nope, no casual here! Puzzle Quest, come for the casual combat stay because you're too absorbed in a game you, like everyone before you, has gotten way too in-depth with. Maybe if I can capture the spiders I can combine their effect with my boots to... but then mage hand... and then... Board clear! Also, mods if you're into that.   Portal 2 - What can be said about this game that you don't already know? Well, besides the amazing campaign which needs no introduction, the community maps are largely incredible. People have spent a ton of time making some truly mind-boggling puzzles to scratch that brainer itch that the campaign didn't.  SUPER SPECIAL SADIST BONUS  SpaceChem - Jesus is this game good. And hard. And good. And holy fuck hard. Programmers beware- you will get too into this game and see the sun coming out as you've spent hours and hours building the solution to that FINAL FUCKING PUZZLE."

Binding of Isaac: Rebirth - one of the darkest and most interesting stories I've ever seen in a game. Infinitely replayable as well.  Chivalry: Medieval Warfare - because the triple feint is real.  Bonus: Insurgency because it's an amazing team shooter with a mature playerbase.  Edit: Here are some other non-steam game recommendation I'd make, though, you can put them on your Steam library anyway:  Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead A very interesting, open-source roguelike that is updated several times a day. 100% free, but not for everyone.   Custom, vanilla/TBH World of Warcraft server. Not only are custom servers free, you get to experience World of Warcraft at its absolute prime with a mature and friendly community, since it takes a bit of work to get it.

Steam,3dsjc0,gingrawr,5,Sun Jul 19 02:15:52 2015 UTC,"Have you played Terraria in the past 3 years? It has a metric ass-ton of content and no Early Access game, certainly not Starbound whose incompetent developers take ages to release updates, matches it."
Steam,3dsjc0,Derpface123,2,Sun Jul 19 02:39:35 2015 UTC,"Agree to disagree for Starbound. Me and my friends find the content lacking in Starbound. I strongly dislike randomized weapons and the weapons didn't even seem good and there's no variety other than some weapons having an additional effect, but that was also random. Sure there was plenty of decoration, but I didn't really feel like I was progressing. The quest line was pretty bad too. Had cool environment effects, but enemies were overpowered, and hit pretty far away.  There will be an argument over how the developers never release any content but there's two ways for that. The amount of content through updates doesn't come close to how well Terraria pulled it off. I appreciate what content we get through new versions, but it just doesn't seem enough, where whenever Terraria gets new content, I am satisfied.  In Terraria, there's progress through weapons and biomes. since I knew how progressing went, I knew how much I was progressing. Although people complain with having the single map restriction, I don't mind it. With the newest update, it expands during the progress.  861 Hours (Terraria) vs 106 Hours (Starbound)"

Right click - properties - security - advanced - and configure them so nobody has the right to change attributes, even you (it's in advanced permissions). You can grant that right back to yourself any time afterwards.  But I would not recommend doing that and suggest you try some other way of solving whatever problem you're having."
