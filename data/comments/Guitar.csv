Guitar,3e2w5g,_Ek_,35,Tue Jul 21 15:22:11 2015 UTC,"I think it's pretty accepted here that Mayer is an exceptional musician. He's said in (several?) interviews before that he knew he would have to write the pop songs in order to be allowed to write the stuff he loves. For anyone who wants more, here's some stuff you can listen to:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKltSZN48zE  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSM3FL7zUdw  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr4sYQUPsf0  The last one is more ballad-y than I think most people here would like, but if you want to test your skills with playing and singing at the same time, I would recommend learning that one. It's tough."

Kinda selloutish.  Edit: getting alot of downvotes, am I wrong here? I love the guy but saying you write popsongs instead of what you really wanna write in order to gain popularity, then in my eyes you're kinda selloutish"
Guitar,3e2w5g,CadeGuitar,27,Tue Jul 21 16:52:05 2015 UTC,"Kind of. Of course the record label only cares about money, so I imagine it went something like ""John, as long as you can make 2 hits this album you can do whatever you want"".  Although a lot of people might disagree, I'm actually grateful he chose to do that, because I'm not sure I would have ever found him if he was an indie artist rather than a big name."
Guitar,3e2w5g,CadeGuitar,11,Tue Jul 21 16:58:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I love like 9/10 out of his songs, just not the cheesiest ones like Your Body Is A Wonderland and Love Is A Verb, but if he'd rather do songs where he shows his guitar skills I think he should do that, those are the best ones anyways."
Guitar,3e2w5g,CadeGuitar,9,Tue Jul 21 17:05:06 2015 UTC,"I agree. If you haven't heard already, John Mayer Trio (his older stuff) is where he did a lot of the stuff you're looking for (I think)"
Guitar,3e2w5g,CadeGuitar,4,Tue Jul 21 17:07:03 2015 UTC,"I've only listened to what's on Spotify by the Trio, the live album with basically the same songs as on Where the Light Is but a shorter setlist. Is there more out there?"
Guitar,3e2w5g,diddlydiddler,2,Tue Jul 21 17:13:51 2015 UTC,"I'll be honest I haven't really listened to the trio a lot, but from what I've seen spotify has all of it :/"
Guitar,3e2w5g,bolanrox,3,Tue Jul 21 17:18:00 2015 UTC,"I watched a few of his Periscope videos (ok, I watched all of them), and he said that he would probably do the Trio thing again sometime in the future!"
Guitar,3e2w5g,iHasABaseball,2,Tue Jul 21 17:29:58 2015 UTC,"I'm excited! In an interview (I think the oxford union one) I believe he said that his next (last?) album he wants to go back to his roots, and focus on producing songs that are really complex musically. If that's true then I really can't wait for his future stuff"
Guitar,3e2w5g,bolanrox,3,Tue Jul 21 17:34:29 2015 UTC,Sounds great! Doubt he was talking about Paradise Valley since that probably has the least complex songs he's done.
Guitar,3e2w5g,blakeblake,7,Tue Jul 21 17:43:41 2015 UTC,"definitely is.  I have no shame saying i'd sellout if it meant i'd be rich and have the opportunity to play how he wants in front of crowds.  It's the faster easier way to the top, but who can blame him as long as he's still true to roots"
Guitar,3e2w5g,troub,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:12:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah I agree. I'm glad he can keep the music alive by playing it to hundreds and thousands of people who otherwise would never hear that kind of stuff, like his Hendrix covers for example."

Guitar,3e2w5g,Andy_B_Goode,4,Tue Jul 21 17:02:46 2015 UTC,"It wasn't about getting a contract, not in the way you're implying at least. Hair/Glam metal was simply the thing to do those days and their original lead singer was very into it. As soon as Phil Anselmo took the stage, their demeanor changed completely."

Guitar,3e2w5g,Andy_B_Goode,2,Tue Jul 21 18:16:16 2015 UTC,Pantera's first three albums were glam/hair metal.  Which was due to their original singer.  It had nothing to do with getting exposure.  They don't even list their first three albums on their discography.

I remember talking to some guy back in junior high, and he was telling me about this ""Dimebag Darrell"" guitarist and if I had ever heard of him, and I was like ""Oh, you mean Diamond Darrell. He's called Diamond Darrell. Yeah, I've heard of him."" Set off one of those huuuuge middle school arguments which one of us is a fucking dumbass who doesn't know what he's talking about. He just hadn't ever heard of the hair metal Pantera, and I had been seeing Darrell for years in Guitar World or whatever as ""Diamond Darrell."""

Guitar,3e2w5g,Butterfly-Dreams,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:03:06 2015 UTC,It's almost more like the opposite of that: he started his career creating vapid pop music and then switched to making the music he truly loved once he got famous.
Guitar,3e2w5g,bananaking43,4,Tue Jul 21 17:34:16 2015 UTC,"room for squares = vapid pop music? there's some really interesting work on that album. it may be more ""poppy"" than some of his more recent albums, but that doesn't mean it's not still musical and well-composed."
Guitar,3e2w5g,agentwiggles,2,Tue Jul 21 18:25:39 2015 UTC,"You know I don't think I've ever listened to the whole album. Probably should do that at some point. Still, I think it's fair (if a bit harsh) to describe You Body Is A Wonderland as ""vapid pop music""."
Guitar,3e2w5g,agentwiggles,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:28:00 2015 UTC,"saying you write popsongs instead of what you really wanna write in order to gain popularity   I think the better interpretation is ""I wrote pop songs so that I could also write the songs that I really wanted - because the stuff I really wanted to do, until I gained some fame, wasn't going to pay the bills.""  Call it a sellout, call it whatever you like, but in the end, he's making music that other people love, while still being able to make the music that he loves. He played the game, and he won, and now he's famous enough that he can probably do away with the pop music altogether and still live comfortably."
Guitar,3e2w5g,GoldenBoy25,-1,Tue Jul 21 19:24:43 2015 UTC,"Is it being a sellout? Or is it just being a professional musician. You gotta play whatever makes money. Most professional musicians I know take whatever gigs pay the most. Best paying(consistent) gigs I know of are playing in a pit for Broadway type shows. Are those guys selling out? It sure as hell isn't music they want to play. Would you call a pilot that flies fighter jets but takes a job with an airline a sell out? Being a musician is a God damn profession not ""hey let's play music only we like that everyone will hate."" that doesn't get you paid.   So basically, yes you're wrong and fuck you. Calling someone a sell out is a slap in the face of every professional musician. This guy is actually making money doing what he loves, and is famous for it. It's not his fault today's music scene is utter shit. Hate the game not the player."
Guitar,3e2w5g,GoldenBoy25,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:25:54 2015 UTC,"So basically, yes you're wrong and fuck you. Calling someone a sell out is a slap in the face of every professional musician.    Okay cool down, all I really said was ""Kinda selloutish"", I get what you are saying but I really hope you get me too, you don't have to agree but atleast recognize there is some truth in what I'm saying. As I've said already, I love the guy and appreciate what he does, I think he should do whatever he likes but from what the other guy said it sounded like he didn't do what he liked, he did what gained popularity, again nothing against that just kinda selloutish.   Also, being as good as Mayer is I have no doubt whatsoever that he would be famous even if he only wrote the non-pop stuff. Obviously not as popular though.   I love John Mayer. Didn't mean to upset anyone and definitely not slap him in the face.   I could probably have writen this in like one sentence but I suck at explaining what I really mean... I'm rambling here..."

Guitar,3e2w5g,bebogrove,4,Tue Jul 21 17:50:27 2015 UTC,"He's so damn good. I find his personality grating, but there's no denying that he's a phenomenal musician. For an example of him really going Hendrix, check out his cover of Bold As Love from Live at the Nokia Theater. He really nails it. It's slightly marred by the weird little speech he gives in the middle (grating personality). Still an awesome rendition that does Jimi justice."
Guitar,3e2w5g,circleof5surecanjive,2,Tue Jul 21 16:57:04 2015 UTC,"Haha yeah that speech in Bold as Love is so corny!  About his personality, I think he just really wanted to be a star, back then anyways, he seems really smart and bright I'd say and a pretty down to earth no-bullshit guy."
Guitar,3e2w5g,chilfhunter,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:08:08 2015 UTC,I have heard that he's dropped that act somewhat so I'm willing to give him the benefit of the doubt. But yeah haha that speech is pretentious as hell. I'd be embarrassed to have rambling like that recorded!

Guitar,3e2w5g,bassfingerz,4,Tue Jul 21 17:10:21 2015 UTC,I believe the Trio only put out a live album thus far. But it is much more  blues rock than his solo stuff with three fabulous musicians.
Guitar,3e2w5g,Governor_Rumney,2,Tue Jul 21 17:18:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah, their album ""Try!"" is pretty blues-rocky. I will say though that I don't really like how it was mastered, everything sounds really thin to my ears. However, the trio plays a set on his live album and everything sounds fantastic on that. I would recommend listening to the tracks ""Who Did You Think I Was"", and ""Good Love Is On The Way""."
Guitar,3e2w5g,ballinthrowaway,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:20:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah but both those tracks are on ""Where the light is"", his live stuff is pretty much perfect, I love it, because he plays the songs so differently than on the albums, adding crazy sweet solos and stuff."

He was an amazing guitar player and after some help from him and through music, I started to get my life together. I dedicated every spare hour for the most part to learning bass and guitar, and the year after went into community college, got all A's and a very few b's, went back into college, graduated on the dean's list and now I play keys, didgeridoo, mandolin, violin, hand drums, drums - anything besides flutes or woodwinds.  Music heals us, explains us, and connects us. It's so reassuring to see other people who were in a similar position and came out better from music. Congrats man not many get out of where we were."

I'm confident when I say that my experience will reflect that of a lot of people, but not everyone.  Learning scales is the very, very, very beginning of being able to improvise or play lead. It's like the first 10%. Learning how to apply them in a musical context is the other 90%, and I (and probably most people) cannot/did not learn how to apply them by running rote through scales all across the fretboard.   I didn't learn how to apply scales in a musical context without learning other players material. Knowing certain scales helped me understand what they were doing and why certain things that sounded cool. I was then able to rip off what they were doing while still sounding a little different than the guy I nicked.   One of my goto things to do on a looper when people ask me to play is the underlying chord progression for the intro of ""you only live once"" by the Strokes. Then I rip off the same musical idea of the intro's harmony, but you would never be able to tell that's what I did unless I showed you."

Totally agree. Its blind memorization but gives a foundation for the other 90%.   Also, what I have learned through my interactions, is that a lot of players who criticize the Pentatonic Scale never actually learned all 5 shapes in one key. And, in my opinion, not knowing the full series is horribly handicapping and cause a lot of people to blame the scale when they should really be blaming themselves/their teachers for not teaching it to them correctly.  And learning other people's material is also a great resource. My philosophy has always been to use every tool at your disposal."

When you talk about pentatonic scales you assume that the beginner will know that you refer to the minor and major ones. You're oblivious to the fact that there are pentatonic scales beyond those two categories. This is worth telling the beginner. You subscribe to a school of thought wherein learning patterns is the key to being able how to improvise, even though they really aren't.  You lift your fingers way too much when you fret the notes. I wonder how fast you can play...  The other day you told a guy who asked ""what chords fit together"" that he should just harmonize the degrees of a diatonic scale.

Yes, because I don't subscribe to your school of thought, like when you told me that I made a ""mistake"" by telling beginners that E + F and B + C were together and that I should have told the beginner (to quote your exact words):   You should have explained in that video how every major scale has a semitone between the third and fourth, seventh and eigth degrees of the scale.   Because surely your way is focused on teaching the student and not wanking over your own ""expertise"".   When you talk about pentatonic scales you assume that the beginner will know that you refer to the minor and major ones.   No, I tell them to memorize all 5 shapes in C major / A minor so that I can then immediately explain to them how the minor and major work within that scale.    You lift your fingers way too much when you fret the notes.   And you can tell that how? Have you zoomed into the video?   I wonder how fast you can play...

Like yesterday when you posted this overly dramatic (and not very musical) solo to the sub for the sole reason of getting some kind of attention.  A lesson that you (after-the-fact) claimed that you recorded to show your student:   How to use exotic scales on top of regular chords just to change the character of a chord. In other words, how F Lydian #2 with a minor seventh will make Fmaj7 sound different than playing A minor pentatonic or F Lydian on top. Or how the E augmented scale will sound on top of E7#9. Or how a minor pentatonic with a flattened root will sound on top of a Amin7th chord.   Wank.   Honestly, you bully a lot of people on this sub and I am here to go head to head with you anytime. I won't shy away from it. I don't see you as a threat in any way because I don't see any of this as a ""contest""."

Guitar,3e2dvk,Woland99,2,Tue Jul 21 17:34:04 2015 UTC,"I think you should stay away from backing tracks - at least in the beginning. Get a looper and record a simple ONE chord vamp - using chord related to scale that you want to practice. Then start playing - at first you do scales. then try sequences based on scales. Then simple riffs based on few steps of the scale - 1st, 3rd, 5th - maybe 7th. Whatever you play make sure you land on a chord tone on a strong part of the beat. So if you play eight notes and you play scale based on say C7 then make sure that on 1, 2, 3 and 4 you land on C, E, G, or Bb and not on D, F, A. In short - learn scales - learn fingering - but when you practice play short melodies based on scale using smae fingering. Then at some point move to two chord vamps.  Then try 3 chords with substantial harmonic shift eg ii-V7-I (Dm-G7-C) etc and make sure you can outline G7 -> C movement. Then try more complex turnaround. Then eventually do backup tracks. Use your OWN tracks - it is way too easy to sound good with professional ones and it does not teach you how to play good rhythm. But don't start with backup tracks - it is too overwhelming so you end up noodling substandard stuff that is usually not harmonically specific (good solo should completely obviously outline harmony - if somebody mutes backup track then your solo alone should SPELL OUT harmony)."
Guitar,3e2dvk,Rotationation,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:49:45 2015 UTC,"I jump back and forth between improv sing over a backing track and learning other guitarist's solos.   When you combine them, you'll start to see why someone made a move that they did in the solo.   A descending pentatonic crawl down the fretboard might actually be the guitarist landing each chord change with the right note and then ringing out on some kind of dissonant note to create a bit tension. Until you start to read those things, it can be tough to figure out on your own."

Might as well swipe all the electronics and grab some good stuff off stewmac or elsewhere. My first proper electric was an Affinity Strat that I've modded all to hell and back, but it was comfortable, so with some hardware/electronics swapping to suit my tastes, it's perfect for me and what I need from a guitar. So yeah, I'd day go for a swap but I'd suggest revamping all the electronics if you can."

However, there's many great tutorials online in picture and video format (Google and YouTube). Or, you could spend some money on pre-wired ""harness"" kits that will go right in minus connections to the pickups, ground wire, and output jack; so the hard stuff's all done for you. Or, if you've got a reputable shop, you could have a tech do it for you, which costs some $$$, but at the same time if it's a good shop they'll stand by their work so if you end up having an issue needing troubleshooting, they'll get it figured out assuming everything's not done right the first time. My opinion, at least."
Guitar,3e2xd7,pain-and-panic,2,Tue Jul 21 17:53:51 2015 UTC,"This kind of thing is TOTALLY worth it if you can do the work yourself. I've found stock pickups on most guitars under $400 to worth replacing. Under $200, almost anything sounds better.   Here are some examples:  These are solid pickups, and in my experience, better then Squire stock pickups.     http://www.guitarfetish.com/Strat-and-Tele-Guitar-Pickups_c_8.html  http://www.guitarfetish.com/Humbucker-Sized-Guitar-Pickups_c_26.html   Next I like Tonerider pickups. Very good for the money.  http://www.tonerider.com/  Finally I've never been disappointed in a Seymour Duncan pickup. They can be quite expensive though. Example the JB: Google Shopping List  An Affinity is probably worth putting ~ $75 in upgrades, total if you can do that work yourself.   Here is my Squire Standard as an example.

Guitar,3e2xd7,Lance_Hays,2,Tue Jul 21 15:59:16 2015 UTC,"Consider the cost of the pickups you want and whether the build quality of the guitar is with spending that kind of money. Also consider whether you will have to pay someone to do it. You will get hum from most single coils unless they are some type of noiseless pickup, which usually don't come cheap. If it's just the hum that's bothering you, maybe look at a noise gate pedal or something."

If you want to change them out yourself you will need soldering kit and know how to solder properly.

Guitar,3e2xd7,LionsMouth,3,Tue Jul 21 20:43:57 2015 UTC,"In my opinion, yes. Depending on the pickups you want, could be more expensive than the guitar.

I would get a professional setup before you decide on any mods."
Guitar,3e2xd7,Zytran,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:22:02 2015 UTC,"I would get a professional setup before you decide on any mods   Agree. If the guitar has never been set up professionally, a good tech will be able to point out whether or not the guitar was even made correctly or has issues that are a strict no go over the long term, like a twisted neck or something. If there is a minor issue like a bad ground or whatever that is exacerbating the hum, a good tech might be able to fix it cheaply or for free while they are doing the set up."

Guitar,3e2xd7,disgustedRedditor,4,Tue Jul 21 15:52:20 2015 UTC,"If you told me you had a friend that could install the new pickups for free and had a spare set he'd sell you cheap, I'd say go for it. But if you're looking at putting a $200 set of pickups, plus $50+ tech labor into a guitar that's maybe worth $100 used on a good day, I'd say just save for a new guitar that has pickups you like already in it. I think you get the idea here..."
Guitar,3e2xd7,LionsMouth,2,Tue Jul 21 15:59:52 2015 UTC,"Remind you can always use the pickups again in a different guitar later on down the road. If you want to do an incremental upgrade now, pickups could be a good idea."

Guitar,3e28m5,DarkAvenger225,5,Tue Jul 21 13:17:02 2015 UTC,"They are also mislabeled.  They are actually right side tuners.  Those tuners belong on the other side of the headstock.  Not just because of tradition, but for real mechanical reasons: the pull exerted by the strings forces the post to tilt a little inside the tuner.  With the tuning knob (and worm gear) on the far side of the tuner, this force holds the two gears firmly together.  This is the conventional way to install them.  On the other hand, with the tuning knob (and worm gear) on the nut side of the tuner, the string pull actually forces the gears slightly apart inside the tuner.  This creates extra slop/backlash in your tuner and makes it more difficult to tune your guitar.  It also wears the gears unevenly and the tuners won't survive as long."

In other words, a person could pick up a guitar and have no idea about scales, keys, anything.... and they could play this game.   Or also, a person who knows scales, keys, notes inside and out, etc... They could do this with totally random notes (like intentionally trying to not play a scale) and through trial and error, they could probably come out with some super cool/interesting licks and open up their playing.  Another thing, when I go through this game I tend to pay attention to the little variations, like adding bends, vibratos, pull offs, etc... But one could simply play staccato notes and approach it as a strictly memorization game. For their brain muscle and what not.   This game can even make I more smarter!!!"

Guitar,3dzprx,lippyjose,5,Tue Jul 21 02:53:38 2015 UTC,"Sorry about the sound (people with headphones). I am honestly shit at recording audio through my computer and I cannot seem to figure out why it even publishes to youtube with only one channel.   I mean, honestly, why would youtube not fix that? Why would it literally publish a one-channel audio video? WhYYYY??/???  /rant"
Guitar,3dzprx,voidref,5,Tue Jul 21 00:16:04 2015 UTC,"Sounds like you're recording through one microphone, so you're getting a mono track.  It then seems like whichever video editing program you're using is then rendering the video with just that mono track, which youtube will put in the left channel.  Is there a stereo option you missed when rendering?  Alternatively, you can run the audio through a DAW (Reaper is a good free-to-demo-indefinitely choice).  A DAW will automatically make a stereo file by duplicating the mono track across both stereo channels, which youtube should play correctly."

Guitar,3e3tqk,keyboardname,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:13:29 2015 UTC,"Is it possible to play through the gt-6 using no actual amp?   Yes, the GT6 has a headphone output. It also has (I think) amp modeling as one of its FX lines so you'll have a little bit more than ""just"" the guitar signal.   If not, can I go through a cyber deluxe (can you use pedals on that type of amp? I thought they didn't work the same as with a tube amp)?    You can use pedals with any amp. From a certain perspective, you could argue that some pedals work better with solid state amps - once you dial in the tones and sounds you want, you can turn the amp volume up without having to worry as much about how the effects will play with the rapidly heating tubes. On the other hand, there are plenty of standalone overdrive pedals that are distinctly intended to boost the signal that's going into a tube amp to get classic tube overdrive sounds. Some of these pedals won't do much on a solid-state amp and will sound more like a clean boost than an overdrive.   The Boss GT6 is not that kind of pedal. It's one that I would guess falls in the category of sounding better into a solid state. For best results, dial in a nice clean tone on the amp and set up some amp or overdrive presets on the board for those sounds.   Anyway - if I'm way off base I'm happy to be corrected. I borrowed a friend's GT8 for a couple weeks to play around with but never got past using the headphone jacks. I'm more of a stompbox guy myself, when it comes right down to it."

Even a full dreadnought. You'll need a hard-sided case. Preferably a hard plastic flight case. I've got a hardshell plastic one that... I mean, you could stand on it and it wouldn't hurt the guitar. I've put the guitar through the checked bagged in that thing before, no issues. Pack any extra space with soft old rags or extra foam.  Some people loosen the strings. I always have, but I have no idea if that's a good plan or no.   If you're willing to spend on it... this should be nigh-indestructible. Just get the size that fits your guitar."

Guitar,3e3l1h,DuckTux,0,Tue Jul 21 19:11:48 2015 UTC,"The topic under discussion is how to avoid the hop altogether by changing the angle of the pick.   And yes I do think it's a good idea to practice with a metronome, I said so in my last reply as well."
Guitar,3e3l1h,DuckTux,2,Tue Jul 21 19:14:30 2015 UTC,In the video he says to avoid string skipping because it's something you can't practice to a metronome. I'm saying he is wrong.

He says that if the technique that you are practicing is flawed then using a metronome will not fix the technique, which is correct. He suggests a technique where the goal is to reduce the 'hop' in string hopping and being able to have a fluent picking motion.  https://youtu.be/KgUcG0aw72U?t=4m20s   Use a metronome, it's good, everyone should, but have another go at the video, there's some cleverness there."

I relistened to it to see if the first part was bad, but honestly the whole track is pretty solid. I think there are one or two parts where the instruments take away from the vocals a bit (I think it might have been the first high note?) so that might be something to keep in mind and examine, but you'll have to decide for yourself if it's an issue or not. Honestly, I really like the style.   I'd be really cool if you posted some videos of your playing some time, I'd love to see exactly what you're doing"

Guitar,3e14kr,scottiel,4,Tue Jul 21 03:47:42 2015 UTC,"This is cool. Part of the reason that you hear the root when you play the 5th below the root is that there it's what's called a ""resulting tone"", or undertone. The common denominator of the frequencies is the frequency of the root of the chord - the c in your first example below the g that's actually played."
Guitar,3e14kr,blackrussianroulette,3,Tue Jul 21 06:41:46 2015 UTC,"If you have two guitar players, have one play this C (XX5588) to go along with the inversion for that wall of guitar sound."

Guitar,3e2qg7,dasCow,4,Tue Jul 21 14:38:33 2015 UTC,"I would say as a general rule, analog for gain based effects (fuzz, distortion, overdrive, etc), and you can go analog or digital for time based effects or modulation (delay, tremolo, chorus, vibe, etc). There's  high and low quality analog, high and low quality digital. I have all analog personally, aside from the two delay pedals I use - those are digital (though they are meant to emulate analog delay sounds). But I've used some great sounding analog delay pedals in the past, and I've used digital versions of some analog effects that sound great (Strymon is a good example of this)."
Guitar,3e2qg7,cinnamongrizzly,2,Tue Jul 21 14:52:05 2015 UTC,"That's a broad question.  The short answer is it depends on a lot of factors including what effects (and their signal chain order) you need in a live situation.  But my preference is:  Amp with +4dB series effects loop + 100+dB dynamic range 24-bit digital effects = no real noticeable ""tone suck"" or lack of dynamics that annoys the shit out of you.  Another real issue is whether the digital effect available can effectively emulate the analog equivalent.  I'm really looking forward to trying the new Line6 Helix.  Industry leading 123dB dynamic range!  Have you heard the Univibe in this thing?!?!?! Finally a unit that is getting it right!"
Guitar,3e2qg7,Mr_You,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:49:51 2015 UTC,Honestly you will be way more happier. I was gonna go with a digital board just to save on costs and pure laziness but I find pedals and boards and all that to be so interesting. They sound way better and you can customize which type of pedals and overdrives and reverbs and all that you want vs. one or two options on your digital board. and the digital boards typical only sound good through a PA. That is just my opinion tho.
Guitar,3e2qg7,-DrEaMz,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:44:10 2015 UTC,"I run all analog board (except for reverb - all reverbs are digital but bood ones will leave dry signal intact and analog). Everytime I want to add digital pedal I listen to it in true-bypass loop - and most of the time I can hear the change in tone - it is loosing ""directness"" - for lack of better word. Does not mean that I will always eschew digital pedals - but as much as I can I will keep them of my chain with TB loopers."

Guitar,3dzfx9,willywompa,3,Tue Jul 21 00:49:55 2015 UTC,Beauty! how much did you end up getting it for if you dont mind me asking?
Guitar,3dzfx9,bbarlag,4,Mon Jul 20 23:14:56 2015 UTC,"Almost 1,500 after tax"
Guitar,3dzfx9,spittingblood,-1,Mon Jul 20 23:35:53 2015 UTC,After tax? What does that even mean?
Guitar,3dzfx9,bbarlag,2,Tue Jul 21 11:11:19 2015 UTC,"The price of the guitar was about $1500 including the sales tax that his state puts on consumer purchases.   For example, in Texas there is roughly an 8% sales tax added on to all purchases (with some exceptions) so a $1000 price tag turns into a $1080 guitar."
Guitar,3dzfx9,spittingblood,3,Tue Jul 21 12:34:18 2015 UTC,Why would you put on a 1000$ price then? That makes no sense.
Guitar,3dzfx9,emptyshark,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:08:17 2015 UTC,Because manufacturers set the price and merchants have to follow them on a lot of product lines like guitars. Consumers in those states know to expect the sales tax.   Moreover it kinda balances out because when there is a state sales tax more often than not there is no state income tax.
Guitar,3dzfx9,themacbeast,16,Tue Jul 21 14:13:50 2015 UTC,"You need a tortoiseshell pickguard.   Edit: Holy smokes, this went from +4 to -1 in 2 hours for something that's totally personal preference. Are tort pickguards suddenly that unpopular?"

Many of these companies offer retro-styled guitars based on the ""Sears catalog"" guitars of old that were sold under brand names like Silvertone, Kay, Harmony, Teisco, and countless others.  You can still find plenty of those for relatively cheap on eBay and craigslist. The parts are usually kind of cheap and crappy, but they have a cool junk guitar vibe and have a great low-fi kind of sound. Annie Clark (of St. Vincent) is usually seen playing an old Harmony Bobkat -- you can still pick those up for under 700."

Guitar,3e1lh8,JesusTouchedMyDick,3,Tue Jul 21 06:45:10 2015 UTC,"Do you know anyone in the vehicle refinishing trade? If so ask them to give it a spray out for you. There is no instance where a job coming from a can will ever beat a gun. The control of a gun leaves less room for error, you don't have to worry about it not atomizing the paint properly and wont have it spit thick droplets of paint essentially ruining your job, coverage is far better, paint quality is incredibly high for the price and the finish of the clear will last and hold appearance far better than a clear from a can or tin. Also, the range of color is near endless to choose from; it gets even better if you ever look into 3 layer pearls. If you ever want to invest in a setup to do it yourself not just for this project, but any projects in the future you can buy a nice gun for about $400 (I personally really like Iwata, Sata and DeVillbliss) then all you'll need to worry about is a compressor. Once you have that, it'll last you far longer than any spray can would. As far as paint and clear goes I think PPG is the way to go for paint and AutoThane is a cheap quality clear."
Guitar,3e1lh8,Rectal_Splash,2,Tue Jul 21 08:18:34 2015 UTC,"Yes. I painted one with many coats from a spray bomb by hanging the body outside on the clothesline, over the lawn.

Just don't use their clear coat. Apparently it takes months to cure properly. I just wet sanded and polished the colour coat. Turned out fine. If you use any car spray paint that is an acrylic lacquer, it should work well on a guitar. Just stay away from enamels or that rubbery stuff used to spray houses. That will never get hard enough for a guitar finish. Months after you apply it you'll still leave fingerprints in it. Car paint is made to set hard and withstand the elements."

Guitar,3e1da7,eruerable,3,Tue Jul 21 08:29:38 2015 UTC,"It really depends on what you need and your budget.  If you want the best of the best or the ability to use many, MANY demanding effects (pitch shifters, for example) a dedicated unit would be your best choice.  Something like an Axe FX or POD HD Pro X/Helix would be great for this.  If you need only a few sounds (distorted, clean, lead, etc... simple stuff) a DAW with plugins that is MIDI controlled to switch parameters would be a doable option.  I know Rings of Saturn uses Waves GTR for their live tone within a DAW."

Guitar,3e1da7,Starcrusher,0,Tue Jul 21 05:27:26 2015 UTC,"Another friend told me about this.  Can you explain more?  Your guitar plugs into where, exactly?  How does the amp connect to the software?  USB Cable?  Does the amp have a headphone jack?  1/8""? 1/4""?"
Guitar,3e1da7,captshady,2,Tue Jul 21 14:11:38 2015 UTC,"The guitar plugs into the amp just like any other. The difference is that the amp runs software that ""shapes"" the output signal as if it was coming from another amp. See HERE for examples of different sounds. You can also plug a USB cable between the amp and your computer and adjust the way the simulations work. Like More delay, less tremolo, more sustain, etc. Then you can save that data for use when you're playing back a song. The amp has a headphone jack (1/4, I think). The presets lessen the need for dedicated pedals. It makes the amp much more than a standard amp. The amps are solid state but tend to be higher power than other comparable amps in the same price range."
Guitar,3e1da7,Starcrusher,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:33:12 2015 UTC,"I think most guitarists and recording engineers would disagree with you. The Logic amp modeler is going to have tons more sounds than most modeling amps, certainly more sounds and control than the Fender Mustang. Most reviewers agree that the preset sounds are the WORST part of any modeling amp or hardware, so it's probably not going to simplify your search for time. Adding an amp and an extra cable isn't going to simplify anything IMO."

Guitar,3e1hx8,mixedmessengers,2,Tue Jul 21 13:30:38 2015 UTC,"I guess I'm starting to learn that in blues you can use pretty much anything as a passing tone if you do it right.    Here's a secret: that applies to pretty much all music, not just blues. People around here get too hung up on scales. Chord tones and passing tones are really where it's at. Heck, the chromatic scale is the one scale that is most useful to get under your fingers. It's just the bit about ""doing it right"" that seems to throw people."
Guitar,3e1hx8,ChuckEye,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:55:43 2015 UTC,You know the diminished scale (half/whole) if you take out the 2nd note in the scale is a great blues scale. It's all over Gershwin tunes.
Guitar,3e1hx8,Johnny_Guano,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:19:45 2015 UTC,"My suggestion for guitar players in the early stages of reaching out of the pentatonic is to try all the other notes along with it. So lay down any chord progression and try using the notes between the notes in the pentatonic.   For what it's worth, if you're placing notes between a whole step interval you may have to omit one in that run. At that point you aren't adding notes you're changing them. So in a minor pentatonic you can substitute the minor 3rd for a major 3rd.   The intervals that you can add notes between are the one and a half step intervals. There are 2 notes in between that you can play with. I'm a big fan of half step bends into the pentatonic. For an exercise you can try using all the adjacent notes to the pentatonic scale and bending into the notes.   I think the key is maintaining what you already know. If you can solo in minor pentatonic all day then you should keep that. From there you can expand to the notes around the scale. If you simply add in the notes that the pentatonic omits from the natural minor scale they add a nice flavor.   My suggestion is use the pentatonic as your safe scale. When playing you'll know where you can always land. If you accent with the other notes it will still sound mostly like a pentatonic.   I should make a video on this. I find a lot of people struggling with the concept of 'playing out' of a scale."
Guitar,3e1hx8,TibbittsN,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:59:27 2015 UTC,"Try learning how to play over chord tones with the mixolydian scale. That's what I'm working on now.

Guitar,3e1gh9,TibbittsN,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:41:03 2015 UTC,I'm thinking about switching to passives.  I'll try to let you know what went wrong in the first place.
Guitar,3e1gh9,sdjp1991,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:54:20 2015 UTC,"It's possible that a visual inspection of the wiring won't figure out the problem. Depending on the circumstances, sometimes wires can break somewhere in the middle underneath the insulation. It's not the most common because guitar players aren't pulling on the wires but it is a possibility.   If both pickups are experiencing low output it's possible that it isn't a problem with the pickups but something else causing the issue. It's unlikely that both pickups have gone bad simultaneously. Has it always been like this or is it a new problem?  It could be that the battery is shorting out somewhere. EMGs will still have an output, although incredibly low, when there isn't even a battery in them. I tried to play a joke on a friend by putting clear tape on his guitar battery once and it still had an output. It was a shitty joke, I know. I also did this to somebody's xbox once because he was stupid. Nothing better than clear tape on one of the prongs on the power cord, nobody will ever find it."

Guitar,3e0ae0,wrongwayjay,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:49:24 2015 UTC,Wrongway is correct.  The neck set is very different on a guitar designed to use a floating bridge.  It might be an option if you were setting the guitar up for slide.

Guitar,3dz07v,shoilawk,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:46:28 2015 UTC,Preamp tubes in combos probably should be replaced every 2-3 years. Power tubes should be yearly. In heads you can probably get away with 5 years for preamps and 2-3 years on power tubes in heads depending on how hard you work them.

Guitar,3dz07v,Testiculese,2,Mon Jul 20 20:53:25 2015 UTC,"you also might need to turn it up more, most amps don't get going under 1 on the volume knob so if you're playing at home quietly it won't be near its best."

Guitar,3dz07v,honeyiscool,-1,Mon Jul 20 21:16:11 2015 UTC,"Actually, the Peavey Bandit Transtube is a fantastic amplifier, so it doesn't surprise me that your 6505+ doesn't measure up to it. Just because 6505+ is a well known tube amp doesn't mean it automatically beats the SS amp that you've spent many years getting to know and adjust to. You need to take some time to learn every new amp. However, it also might need new tubes."

Guitar,3dz07v,Strykrol,2,Tue Jul 21 00:42:56 2015 UTC,"Before you buy new tubes, sometimes you can determine how old the current are (by how orange/brown the tubes are, similar to a lightbulb).  Also, if your tubes aren't chirping or screaming at you, getting them re-biased is a cheaper way to go before you get new tubes altogether. In any case, always get your amp/tubes biased when bought new."
Guitar,3dz07v,Strykrol,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:44:11 2015 UTC,"That's good to know, thanks for the info. I put new tubes in without biasing them and they seem to be doing great. Mind you I replaced 12AX7 with 12AX7 and 6L6 with 6L6 so I would imagine that helps."
Guitar,3dz07v,blofly,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:18:00 2015 UTC,"That's good that they sound great, but just a heads-up that Biasing isn't just about tone quality. In fact, tone is a derivative of the primary purpose of biasing:  Maximizes tube efficacy by optimizing voltage utilization  Too much verbiage, but the long and short of it is that by making your tubes work with minimal effort and maximum output, you both:  1) Improve tone quality  2) Extend tube life  Thus, always re-bias regardless of whether you are using identical brand/model tubes - Quality Control on electronics is never perfect, and avoiding ""marginal"" improvement at the outset tend to compound into larger problems, putting more wear and tear on other tubes which degrades the aforementioned points."

Having said that, I'd prefer manual bias because you remain in control of your gear. Also, sometimes you do wanna push the tube limits to get the tone control you're after.   I work in the tech industry, so I'm all about automation and letting the machine do the heavy lifting, but with guitar I prefer to minimize external influence and avoid outsourcing my control. Again, I don't know much about auto-biasing topologies."

Guitar,3dyig1,bolanrox,4,Mon Jul 20 18:00:22 2015 UTC,"This is good advice.  I've bought a lot of equipment from GC used online.  I always call the store and talk to an employee like he's my buddy and ask them what they think about the equipment that I'm asking about.  Recently I was in the market for a JVM410 and saw one, the picture made it look like it was in great shape and the description said the same.  When I spoke to an employee he mentioned to me that the screws on the top holding the vent in place seemed a bit rusty.  This was all the information I needed to know that buying this particular head was a risk.  It's also a good idea to make sure you know what's coming with the shipment.  Is there a switch, are the power cables there, stuff like that.  Once I've placed the order I also like to call the store and talk to whoever is in charge of the shipping and let them know I'm really looking forward to my purchase and that I would ultra appreciate care in packing.  Of course I always do this with a sense of respect and talk to them like their an old friend.  It helps.  It's also good to note that if you live near a GC store they will ship from store to store for free, saving you a boatload on larger items. So far, I've purchased a JCM 2000 head, a 1960a can, a 2x12 cab, a line 6 HD500x and some other small things. Doing this, I've only had one issue, and that was with a mistake and a new under trained employee being left alone to ship an item when the regular guy was out sick.  The issue was rectified and they even expedited the shipping for me because they knew I was leaving town for an event.

Guitar,3dyig1,gehenom,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:48:51 2015 UTC,"We price the pieces of gear with ebay in mind, as well as what other stores sell that particular piece for. Typically, it gets priced a small chunk under the mean ebay price. After all, GC does have to compete with that market and still sell these used pieces for a profit. Just because it's cheaper than online doesn't mean the guitar is absolutely trashed! :)"

After all, GC does have to compete with that market and still sell these used pieces for a profit. Just because it's cheaper than online doesn't mean the guitar is absolutely trashed!    That is pretty obvious, but the price on the guitar I was looking at is way undervalued. The same store carries a lower-end model of the same guitar and is selling that for $150 more. I checked the rest of their inventory. The only explanation is someone totally messed up or it's in pretty poor shape. Or, as I said, they just can't sell it locally...but that theory has gone out the window based on the fact that they have several similar models, including lower-end models, selling for higher prices, and someone who works for GC said taking a picture and adding it to the online inventory is the first thing they do."

Guitar,3dyig1,domisabear,3,Mon Jul 20 20:54:15 2015 UTC,"GC employee here. We buy used stuff in literally every day, and for the most part have a good standard of what we buy in - it all works, is priced fairly for its condition/age, etc. We're also required to clean up the guitars (polish, oil, restring, etc.), though some don't.  At my store, we include at least a picture of the body, full front, back, and full rear, as well as close ups of any significant blemishes. In response to the ""just hasn't been selling locally"" part of the post, all of the used gear gets posted on the website when it's bought it and processed - usually within a day or two at my store.  Just give the store with the piece of gear you're interested a call. Ask for a guitar guy, then inquire about the piece of gear. They'll go check it out, tell you more information, test it, and probably give you their opinion on the piece if you ask. If the guy is answering the call, odds are he's not too busy and will do all they can to inform you."

One time I called and ordered a used TU-3 that was being sold at a good price ($50 I think?). An hour after I got off the phone, I got a phone call telling me that the pedal had actually been sold already (and had just not been updated in their inventory yet). I was ok with that and just asked if GC had any sort of ""price guarantee"" so I could get the pedal for the $50 price at a different GC store. He told me not to worry about it because he had already shipped out a brand new one free of charge. I was floored. I know that was likely more about good customer service at that store than necessarily GC overall, but I have been an avid GC supporter ever since.   I've had family use the service as well buying me stuff and they've all had good success too they said."
Guitar,3dyig1,Excuse_My_ADD,2,Tue Jul 21 01:50:54 2015 UTC,"I've done it plenty.  You can return it to your local GC, so worst case scenario you just end up paying for shipping.

I only haggled because I wanted a refund in shipping, and I even got that although they didn't have to do that.    I've bought plenty of stuff and never had an issue with a return.

Guitar,3dyig1,pmorrisonfl,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:08:54 2015 UTC,"This is what I thought when I saw a pretty poor picture and a very low price. It seemed possible that they were banking on the fact it would just be easier for you to take a loss and put it in a garage sale than pay for shipping or print out paper work and bring it into your local GC and argue about getting a refund...and even if you did that, it's out of their store and off their hands."

Guitar,3dyvgn,protonfish,2,Mon Jul 20 18:38:59 2015 UTC,"I couple of years ago I learned about 40 songs in 5 weeks on bass just in time to play a show.  Not only did I have to learn to play them, some of these songs I hadn't even heard before.  To do this I had to listen to the songs repeatedly in my car while driving too and from work and spent 3 to 4 hours per night listening, learning and practicing.  If tabs didn't exist or were iffy, I'd listen and write my own if the song was at all complex.  I'd learn a song one riff at a time and then practice the song along with the recording playing it all the way through by playing it to the recording.  If I got to a part I couldn't play correctly, I'd stop learn it properly and then resume the play through.  Each weekend I'd play all of the songs I supposedly knew (stopping to correct errors).  By the last weekend... I didn't stop to correct errors unless they were major because I had to make sure I could really play through the set, but it's best to stop and correct most of the time.  Also, if you're learning from tabs, learn the riff and then play it 10x without the tab book.  If you keep your eyes on the tab you'll never commit it to memory and you'll never learn it.  I've played 100's of riffs while skimming tabs and never remembered any of them.  I used to think it was cool that I've gotten good enough at reading tab that I can play as I read, but it actually stops me from learning songs.

Guitar,3dyvgn,im-on-the-inside,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:30:54 2015 UTC,"These days, I always learn songs by listening to them and figuring out how to play them. This might not be the best way to go when you're new, but I highly recommend it for those of you who have played for years and still use mostly tabs, tutorials and so on.  You'd be amazed not only how much easier it gets once you get some experience, but also how blatantly wrong almost every tab out there is. Some of them only have minor mistakes, but many get key notes in riffs and solos entirely wrong.  I'm pretty sure that doing that also aids with memorization. I remember most songs I've played in the past few years; I might have to refresh my memory by listening and playing through it slowly once or twice, but after that I'm back as if I knew it perfectly all along.  Edit: To be clear: unless it's very simple stuff, I always slow them down. Even things that sound slow can have nuances that aren't always obvious at 100% speed."

IIRC it's a ""half-tube"", in that there's one tube in the pre-amp, but the rest of it is solid state. Plus you can usually find em cheap on Craigslist. Plus it's got a power level control - you can basically turn it from a 100w amp to a 5w amp. You'll still get that fully saturated effect, but you're no longer breaking windows. 100w is a bit too much for me to use in my apartment.   I'd just say get a smaller one - the 30 or the 50.

I started having fun when I played the bass like a bass. They are very different instruments that serve vastly different purposes. It can be melodic, but it also serves as the perfect midway between the drummer (rhythm) and guitar (melody). Once I started finding cool ways of supporting what the melody was doing, while having it's own independent voicing I loved it. The bass is that boom you feel in your chest and a crucial part of music. Once you think of it as a different style you will have fun with it."

On a guitar, if you want to get into it, the stuff your right hand is doing can be just as complicated and technical as your left. Your right hand is a drum, your left is just picking which note to play.   Keep that in mind as you approach the bass. Pick a rhythm on the right hand. Keep it solid. Keep it timed right. Keep it flowing. Add in the right hand. Transitions from note to note are the key. ""Walking bass"" or similar. Look for ways to add accent notes without losing that key, underlying metronome rhythm.   Yeah, if you're just hitting the root note every bar you're gonna be bored as hell. Add some spice to it."
Guitar,3e2nq9,SgtKashim,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:52:21 2015 UTC,"Know your chord tones and extensions, passing tones, how different tensions sound over different chords in your key (e.g. the guitar player's playing a boring old V chord, like the troglodyte that he is, but the bass line is implying a V7b9-  and suddenly some pedestrian playing sounds hip.  But hey, you're 'Just the bassist', right?).  Know how you're getting to the next chord.  Underplay and punctuate chord changes, so your guitar player doesn't miss the change...again.  Follow the bass drum.  Or, conversely, steer the drummer's bass drum to follow YOU, by exaggerating a syncopation or pattern.   A good drummer will pick up what you're laying down and lock in with you.  But keep contact with him, as s/he may want to steer you somewhere.  It's a conversation."

Guitar,3dz5pq,MiguelMarquezMusic,3,Mon Jul 20 18:40:20 2015 UTC,"What exactly are you trying to show your student? I think that is important to know.  Also, from our interactions, I got the impression that you believed yourself to be a fairly advanced guitar player. So I would critique this solo (through the lens of looking as you as an advanced player) by saying that it lacks a common theme. All great solos have melodic elements, themes and ideas that repeat. A great solo builds interesting and different variations from the same theme.  Your solo is nice but it lacks this. You play a lot of notes and ideas but it sounds more like a random assortment of notes (more or less in key) then an advanced solo built from a single concept, melody, or idea.  Also, I don't hear you playing any homage to the chord changes and I think this is important because it makes the solo ""fit"" better and it gives the listener some direction. That may be another reason that it sounds like a random assortment of notes to me.  But I am being really nitpicky here. You obviously know how to play very well regardless of my critique, which is only meant to help you rise to the next level."

How to use exotic scales on top of regular chords just to change the character of a chord. In other words, how F Lydian #2 with a minor seventh will make Fmaj7 sound different than playing A minor pentatonic or F Lydian on top. Or how the E augmented scale will sound on top of E7#9. Or how a minor pentatonic with a flattened root will sound on top of a Amin7th chord.

Sometimes everything just 'came together' on that particular guitar. Most of the time though, that's not the case. Keep in mind, the same thing can happen on higher end guitars. Sometimes, something just isn't right, and it doesn't play like it should.  It's not so much about the brand name, as it is a trust that the brand will put out a quality instrument."

Compare a $100 and a $350 guitar out of the box and it's like night and day. Better fretwork, hardware, electronics etc.  But compare a $350 guitar and a $1000 guitar and the differences aren't so stark. Better hardware, electronics, and details on paper but maybe not to your ear or hands.  Now compare a $1000 guitar and a $3000 guitar, is one objectively better than the other? No way, all personal preference.  You need to spend a minimum amount of money to get a true player out of the box, but over a certain point (lower than you'd expect) you're really paying for bells and whistles"

The Vox AmPlug comes to mind, though there are lots of similar devices. Your tone won't be the same, but let's be honest, it won't be the same with the Rat (or any other) load box either. Might just have to go with your gut.  If I were to buy a load box of some kind, I think I'd go for a unit that can be used with different amps / has different ohm ratings for at least 4, 8, and 16. If it could be used independently, as well as in series or parallel with 1 or more speaker cabs, that would be really cool. The option to use it to convert between a 8 ohm output and a 4 ohm cab (for example), like the Weber Z Matcher would be great.  Sure, 1 unit may not tick all of these boxes, but I'd be looking for more than what the Rat unit seems to offer. Take that with a grain of salt, though, that's just my opinion."

Just be sure that a mahogany top on a small-bodied acoustic is what you want.  The bass may be a bit lacking, with perhaps a little improvement as the top opens up.  Mahogany can have a nice punchy sound for flatpicked lead lines, but I don't love it for fingerstyle - doesn't bloom like spruce or have the warmth of cedar.  I've owned one Fender solid-top acoustic that sounded quiet / muted, and one that sounded really rich and resonant.  A friend of mine plays a Sonoran that's closer to the second category.

Yes, I buy new $10 software patches and I'm in the market for $300 studio monitors, but compared to people buying nicer pedals, tube amps and so on, it's cheap.  The guitar itself is a hard thing; I really want an American strat, but I have a nice True Velvet middle pickup in my Ibanez that gets most of the strat tone I'm after, so I just suck it up when listening to SRV in the car and start thinking ""well I mean, everyone should have a strat..""

Putting your delay before the amp is going to make it sound different. Maybe that will help you find the tone that you want (or a different tone you love). Set everything to zero. After you're done practicing, set all the knobs on your effects to a baseline. Then next time you'll have to start over and find a new tone. Watch reviews of the gear you already have. A lot of times you buy a piece of gear to get a tone you saw in reviews. What great tones are there you can pick up with what you've already got?"

Guitar,3dypee,MysticalTurban,4,Mon Jul 20 16:47:25 2015 UTC,"The red dots are where the root note is found and can tell you the key. For instance, the red dot is on the fifth fret of the E string, so you know that is in the key of A."

Guitar,3dypee,circleof5surecanjive,5,Mon Jul 20 17:21:35 2015 UTC,"There are many different ways to learn and commit this to memory.  Some people will tell you to start on the red notes, or root notes. Some people will tell you to learn by interval and to skip the boxes altogether.  I learned a different way. I learned by breaking up the fretboard into 4 fret (and one 5 fret) boxes. And then starting each shape on the E-bass string and then working it down and back up. Then on to the next shape.  This is how I learned and this is the best way in my opinion. I made a video to explain it because I get asked about it a lot and sometimes words are not enough. But this method of learning being ""the best way"" is only an opinion (other guitar teachers, please don't jump on me for stating an opinion).  I personally think this is the best method because it allows you to map out every dot. And then once that is over (the blind memorization), one can begin to look deeper into what they have played.  I also think this method is good because when you focus on practicing solely by starting on the root (instead of committing to memory first and then doing this step later), then it may be confusing once you realize that every Pentatonic scale has two roots. One root for starting on minor and one for starting on major.   Essentially, (and once again this is my personal opinion) the pentatonic scale is neither major or minor. It is both at the same time. You are the one who makes it major or minor. It is all about context and how you play the notes. So I don't like the idea that people learn it (from the start) as major or minor pentatonic.   That is why I think it is more beneficial to just commit every point to memory. Because then you are learning 2 scales at once and killing two birds with one stone."
Guitar,3dypee,circleof5surecanjive,2,Mon Jul 20 18:27:56 2015 UTC,"thanks, ive never seen it done it that way, great video too :)"
Guitar,3dypee,sky_meadows,3,Mon Jul 20 18:35:14 2015 UTC,"Also, I always teach the C major / A minor first because it doubles as a way of teaching beginners how to find their notes on the fretboard. I start by telling them to start memorizing the note names on the E bass string. Then A string, then D string.   And by memorizing these notes in C major / A minor (instead of say E major), you are learning where all of your ABCDEFG's are. And THEN we get into accidentals."
Guitar,3dypee,awinnie,4,Mon Jul 20 18:43:41 2015 UTC,"The C Major scale and A Minor scale are enharmonics of each other so they are essentially the same scale; the difference is what you are emphasizing (e.g. the A or the C). You can figure these out by using the formula for major scale so for example, the G Major scale, G A B C D E F# G E minor would be the enharmonic. You can check this. It is also reflected in the Circle of Fifths"
Guitar,3dypee,circleof5surecanjive,2,Mon Jul 20 18:48:11 2015 UTC,"The red dots are the root. All the dots in that image are within the A scale, and the red dots are actually the note A.   The best way to learn the patterns are to just pick one of them and get super familiar with it. Then you'll be able to see how it branches out above and below to the others. The most common one is the one starting on the red dot on the 5th fret on the high E (or low E) string in that picture. Put your index finger on that one, then you're pinky should land on the 8th fret of that string. The next string down will have the same pattern, then the next 3 below that will have your index on the 5th fret still, but your ring finger now will be used on the 7th frets. Then the bottom E string is just like the top.   The reason this specific ""box"" works is because you don't have to move your hand. And the notes you'll typically want to ""bend"" when you get better are notes that your pinky or ring finger will be on, so you'll be able to bend them easier. Though that will come later"

If you only learn and focus on one and spend your time really getting that one down, then you are actually NOT seeing how it branches out above and below the others. Because you wouldn't have any concept of the others."
Guitar,3dypee,BJJKempoMan,0,Mon Jul 20 18:34:46 2015 UTC,"it became easier (for me at least) to fit the next pattern into the one i already knew, because the top notes in the pattern i knew would be the bottom notes in the next pattern up (or vice versa when learning the next lowest pattern). So it halved the amount i had to remember. But yeah, it's gonna take some work when you move to another ""box"" regardless"
Guitar,3dypee,skinisblackmetallic,2,Mon Jul 20 20:39:10 2015 UTC,"As already stated, start by learning each scale pattern one at a time. The best way to memorize them and practice finger technique is to simply run up and down the scale patterns from the root note to the next root note. I'd you want, you can start right away doing two octaves as well. Once you have a grasp of the pattern, try moving it around the neck so that you are playing the same pattern but are getting used to playing in different keys and adapting to how it looks in more than one position. Now, to answer you question about switching between A minor and C major in a solo, they are essentially the same scale so of course you can. The underlying chord progression or bass line will lend itself to implying which tonal center (in this case A or C) is being implied."

Any special effects that run in stereo? I've been experimenting with a stereo rig my self and am curious to know how other people make use of the extra utility.
Guitar,3dxf6u,blofly,2,Mon Jul 20 19:24:57 2015 UTC,"I use both at the same time! My Walrus Audio Descent and Boss DD-20 are stereo, and there are some cool pan delays I can do. I also like to use the Tremolo on my twin and and leave the JC-120 normal to get a nice shimmer but still keep clarity. There's also a lot of cool Tremolo/Pan effects that use their full potential in stereo as well. I like being able to EQ both amps to get the most out of both and have a full range of tones.

This is at least one thing that I have learned and I can help you:  Look at one of my first videos.  More recent video.  The answer, a $100 buck webcam.  People really respond (consciously or subconsciously) to the light and overall ""crispness"" of your video. So it kind of sucks that you can have the BEST content ever, but the production value is going to matter more.  In your first video, there is a window behind you and that light is distracting, for example. Unfortunately, people will click to another video just because of a small detail like that.  Invest in a spotlight or (do what I did) gather all of the lights in your place and start messing around with placement.  Hope that helps man!"

Guitar,3dzhln,sarcasmsociety,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:23:39 2015 UTC,"Agreed with /u/sarcasmsociety, the power cord change isn't likely to help with the hum issues. If the amp still has a 2 prong plug I would assume it needs a cap job. Bad power supply caps would cause some hum, so could tubes, so could poor shielding/wire routing, etc.   If you are going to replace the cord check out the sidebar on /r/toobamps for safety tips on draining caps and checking voltages and such.   You want to wire the new cord with the ""hot"" side to the fuse and wire the ground to a loop connector and screw it to the chassis (I usually go with bolting it under one of the power transformer legs). For modern plugs white is hot, black is neutral, green is ground, sometimes the another style might be brown for hot, blue for neutral, white or green for ground."

It's not quite there, but it does a pretty good job none-the-less.    Key downsides: it's a hot amp and the clean channel may start breaking up earlier than you like. The reverb is nothing special and cannot be controlled by the footswitch (meaning if you want to only have reverb on your cleans you'll have to adjust the knob or use a reverb pedal). Speaking of the footswitch, the older models are really picky with what patch chord is being used and the pedal may not function properly; the one that comes with it works fine however (this issue might be  fixed in the newer editions)."

Guitar,3dzfq8,StarTrekMike,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:11:24 2015 UTC,"I think they are okay. Because you're new to pedals, let me throw you some wisdom. Don't listen to anybody who says that objectively and definitely some pedals are better than other pedals. It's completely subjective and too many musicians have spent too much money listening to others instead of their own ears. I've used the lowest of the cheap pedals and boutique hyped pedals and have found I quite enjoy a mix of them with a few boss pedals on my board. The danelectro fish n chips eq and cool cat compressor are great.   Happy hunting! Pedals are almost a hobby unto themselves."

Guitar,3e02ih,heythisis-myusername,3,Mon Jul 20 22:35:42 2015 UTC,"Actually yes, on guitar it really can be as simple as shifting the starting point of a scale to a different root note.  A major scale always has the same pattern of steps:  WWHWWWH, so if you start on a C you get C major without sharps or flats, but if you start on an E you get an E major with F, G, C and D sharp.  It is said that a keyboard instrument is the easiest place to go to see and understand the patterns, but a fretboard instrument is a pretty easy place to play them, IMHO."
Guitar,3e02ih,RhoOfFeh,2,Mon Jul 20 22:41:35 2015 UTC,"What you said is correct, but there is a catch.   First, you have to remember that the notes in c repeat all over the fretboard. Ideally, you will learn all of the shapes and practice them in every key (at least the keys that most western music is in).  On to the catch. Right now, I would assume you are using the repeatable shapes of a scale, and the root note to help you figure out what key you're in. This might suit you for your playing career. However, if you have any intentions on playing more complex music (particularly one of the many forms of jazz), or just be a more well rounded musician, you will be much better off learning the fretboard in terms of notes, not shapes. Much like a pianist would. This is more difficult, and takes much longer. But if you put in the time, it will be well worth it. You will also have a much better understanding of what you're playing."

The classic player series have upgraded Tune-o-matic bridges instead of the old vintage style ones, so you don't have to worry about strings sliding around the saddles. Those guitars are generally factory set up with 9-42's, but maybe you'd want something just a little heavier like 10-46. You'll barely notice a difference. If you wanna just go with 9-42's, just pick up a pack of Ernie Ball Super Slinkies. They're in a pink pack. If you want the 10-46, that would be the Regular Slinkies and they're in a green pack."

Yeah they are cheap but why buy some strings that will sound and feel bad after 2-3 weeks of good playing. Pick up some NYXLs or other strings other than ernie balls. Sound will improve.   Jazzmasters were created to wear/use flat wound strings but they are expensive and I am not to sure if it matters or not.

If you can dial in the tone that you want through your pedal, as long as your amp can get a good clean sound, it will be fine. The great part about this is that having your tone powered by your pedal, you can play through any amp and your tone won't sound different by very much. If you were to use the distortion through the amp, then as soon as you plug into a different amp, you'll have to be fiddling around with the knobs to find your tone, which is a real pain, especially if you have to do it on the fly at a show or something."

Guitar,3dylna,rrredditor,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:59:34 2015 UTC,"I've played the $100 Epiphones and the $100 Squiers and the Epiphones were considerably better guitars at that price point. (This was during Guitar Center's big $100 sale a couple months ago.)  The frets on the Epiphones were more level and the ends were pretty nicely finished. The P-90s on the one I tried had that P-90 sound. Full size pots, too!  Long story short, I bought it and it's sitting in a stand right next to me right now. After I got it home I checked the action at the nut and each string was right at .020"" which is very reasonable. (All my Ibanezes are at .022"" from the factory.)  I consider it to have been a very good deal.  It wasn't a starter pack so I can't say that it is the same, and there may be variation from one to another at that price point.   I think the Slash model amp sounds better then the cheaper bundle so I would go with that one if possible assuming that the guitar itself is one of the good ones.  I can't speak to the Peavey but I've heard good things about their lower end models. I've never played one though."

There's lots of decent amps in the $200 range:  Fender Champ 600, Bugera V5, Yamaha THR5, Fender Mustang II, etc.    A cheap guitar sounds much better through a decent amp then the other way around IMO."

It's like a greasy chapstick you rub on your peg (the wooden one, not the... fleshy one) so it can fit easier on the holes and move smoothly when you twist it...

Guitar,3dybfd,SgtKashim,3,Mon Jul 20 15:06:52 2015 UTC,I've done a combination of a few mods with my strat.  I went with a push/pull to do the series/parallel thing mentioned in your guitarnuts link and also replaced the second tone pot with a blender knob.  I do all the tone controls through the first pot and can blend in the neck pickup when the bridge or bridge/middle are selected with the blender.  Pulling on the push pull does something similar but brings in the neck pickup in series.    I went with Fender N3 Noiseless pickups and this is all on my MIA strat.  I went with GFS active pickups for my MIM strat but with no special wiring (came prewired and I haven't messed with it).  I like both setups and am happy with both several years into it.

Guitar,3dy1if,jrob1977,6,Mon Jul 20 14:50:53 2015 UTC,"I'm a Marshall guy. If you're looking for a two channel amp, I'd get the Marshall or maybe an Orange. If nothing else they should hold their resale value better over the long run. Marshall, Fender, Vox and Orange amps are going to be in demand forever. The Blackstar, H&K and others probably won't age as well. But more importantly, I like the Marshall tone. I think the cleans are very usable and the crunch channel is iconic: Hendrix, AC/DC, GnR, RATM, Zach Wylde, Slayer ... so many guitarists have played Marshall and the sounds are all there in the DSL series.  The other guitarist in my band had a 100 watt Blackstar head for a while. It didn't sound bad, but it didn't blow minds either. His amp had a fancy footswitch that connected using something similar to a VGA cable ... complete with the thumbscrews to attach the cable to the amp. Sounds like a great idea, until you trip over your footswitch cable and either knock the amp off its cab or (as my buddy did) you rip the connector right out of the amp.  I don't have any experience with the new H&K Tubemeister series, other than drooling over the ads a few times. It looks like a great amp. Lots of flexibility in a very practical package. But it also looks kinda cheap and gimmicky. I think that amp is either going to be a big success (like the Fender Hot Rod and Blues amps) or it will disappear in a few years when tastes change.

Guitar,3e0110,TheyCallHimPaul,2,Mon Jul 20 22:24:24 2015 UTC,"practice what makes you happy! there is certainly no ""right way"" to learn guitar. It sounds like you need to learn more chords......however, I don't recommend getting a chord book and learning every chord under the sun. I recommend learning to play songs on acoustic that you enjoy listening to. That way, you become familiar with more chords and it's still fun.  Another thing I like to do (as a lead guitar player) is sit down on the couch and play along with bands you like, or hell....even commercials in between the show you are watching. It's amazing how fast you learn stuff by trying to emulate."
Guitar,3e0110,Yosemite97,2,Mon Jul 20 22:35:50 2015 UTC,"Tommy Emmanuel plays in open position chords nearly all the time. So luckily, the chords you know will be a big help.  I want to preface what I'm about to say by letting you know I'm not trying to discourage you in any way. I started with heavier music as well, and have moved onto acoustic fingerstyle. All of the time and effort you put into learning metal techniques on your electric will be little to no help in your transition. If you think 'Oh, I already know how to play guitar"" and try to jump into TE type playing, you will be quickly discouraged.  Your best bet is to go into it as if you were a total beginner. Pick up some fingerstyle books, and practice those techniques from the ground up.  I've made a couple of posts about this, but I found these books to be a good progression:  The New Art of Ragtime Guitar -> How to Play Ragtime Guitar -> Tommy Emmanuel ""Note For Note""  I found a chose these based on my own interests. Those might be a starting point for you.  If you like TE, here are a bunch of other guitarists you might want to look into:  Merle Travis, Chet Atkins, Jerry Reed, Django Reinhardt, Murielle Anderson, Hiroshi Masuda, Takashi Hamada, Gabriella Quevedo, Adam Rafferty, Michael Chapdelaine, Richard Smith  Hope this helps, and good luck dude! Practice lots, you'll get it."
Guitar,3e0110,F1lthy_Casual,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:45:49 2015 UTC,"I'd recommend adding a few chords to your list.  You should really know how to play F and a few 7 chords, for example.  But yeah, you can go a pretty long way on an acoustic that way.  Simple strumming is one way to go, but you can jazz it up a bit by moving to bass/chord and also chord/melody arrangements, eventually getting to the kind of three part thing T.E. does.  Of course, anything you can play on an electric you can at least try on an acoustic, too.  Sometimes it sounds really good."

Guitar,3e0pqm,F1lthy_Casual,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:21:33 2015 UTC,"It can be done, but I would strongly recommend against it for a couple of reasons:   It's a lot of work, trying to put on a guitar string that has already been wound up. I'm not 100% on this, but I would imagine they will lose their tone faster. Old strings sound dull. The process of tension - slack - tension will probably get them there a lot faster. You will most likely introduce new kinks into the string, especially at the tuning peg. This will make them prone to breaking.   If you really needed to do it you could, and I'm sure people do it all the time. But why waste a perfectly good set of strings. I'd say put them on and leave them on till they're done, then replace the pickgaurd. Or just wait till the pickguard comes, it's only 5 days. Or put them on, cut em off, and buy a new set."

I offered to sell it to him for I what I paid for it, and he wanted to ""pawn"" me the rest of his gear.  Two marshall stacks like 3 guitars for something like 600 bucks. If only I'd had the money."

I have quite a few of his old albums on my general playlist.  He was great live. I went to see him in Guildford. The town where i grew up in England back in the late 80's early 90s and was extremely impressed. I hadn't heard of him before then and hadn't seen really flashy guitar of that nature live before. Only big bands.

Guitar,3dyhe1,deanstag,3,Mon Jul 20 16:34:06 2015 UTC,There are lotsof software you can use to loops of parts of the song at a lower tempo.  My favorite is transcribe.   I play along with each section at a lower tempo.  Sometimes very low.  And keep increasing it.
Guitar,3dyhe1,minersrevolt,3,Mon Jul 20 17:48:13 2015 UTC,Shawn Lane used to always advise against this. He would play everything at the tempo he wanted as he practiced and kept doing it until the mistakes are gone.

Adds more bass. Way cleaner. More dark, less noisy. It allows you to be very 'dynamic' with your touch. You can play really soft or really loud, it maintains that cleanness (roundwounds tend to 'buzz'. idk, 'buzz' isn't the right word for it, but you know what I'm referring to lol)."
Guitar,3dx637,soulintension,2,Mon Jul 20 08:52:09 2015 UTC,"Flats do not produce overtones.  You only get the root note.  This means that in a clean situation they sound amazing.  Almost like a piano with the mute pedal pushed, very articulate.  They get very interesting when you add distortion or fuzz of course because those really accent overtones that now your strings aren't producing naturally.  Distorted flats always remind me of Beatles revolution tone."
Guitar,3dx637,house_45177,2,Mon Jul 20 11:28:25 2015 UTC,Fun Fact: The Beatles used mostly flats for the Majority of the work!  Harrison often used the bottom three/four strings of a set of flats and the remaining top were rounds.

Guitar,3dyves,kavich,7,Mon Jul 20 17:29:05 2015 UTC,"Hi. I'm 14 and know a tad bit about how a gutiar works and stuff. but if I were to buy a les paul, what model would i buy?   Get yourself an Epiphone. Preferably, a used Epiphone.  Or get some very rich parents/neighbors and start cutting grass."
Guitar,3dyves,Son_of_Sophroniscus,3,Mon Jul 20 17:32:47 2015 UTC,I know a guy who mowed lawns all summer and got himself a 58 or 59 lp... granted that was in 66 or so.  :)
Guitar,3dyves,bolanrox,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:34:10 2015 UTC,I did the same 95 - 97 to get a brand new SG.... I guess the seemingly exponential price increases were evident back then.
Guitar,3dyves,Son_of_Sophroniscus,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:21:22 2015 UTC,"hehe. so, when i'm older and skilled and have enough money. what les paul do i get and why?"
Guitar,3dyves,bolanrox,4,Mon Jul 20 17:38:54 2015 UTC,"if they keep going down the path are are taking, i would say used - pre 2014 models :)  To be honest i had a 90's LP jr with p-90's and a 04 57 Goldtop Historic.  but nice guitars and different enough to have both.  Really comes down to what you want out of them.    That said the Jr was sold a while ago, and the LP has been under a bed for years.  Ends up I am definitely more of a fender person."
Guitar,3dyves,Son_of_Sophroniscus,-1,Mon Jul 20 17:50:32 2015 UTC,Tldr: just get a Tele. Lol
Guitar,3dyves,bolanrox,2,Mon Jul 20 20:22:39 2015 UTC,Pretty much. Just save your self the trouble. The Jr was basically a set neck tele :)
Guitar,3dyves,Son_of_Sophroniscus,2,Mon Jul 20 21:31:37 2015 UTC,"When you are older, skilled, and have money, then you will not need to ask that question. You'll know what you like (see /u/bolanrox's comment about our having a preference for fenders, below) and why."

Guitar,3dyves,westosterone26,5,Tue Jul 21 03:53:30 2015 UTC,"My parents made me a deal when I was about your age and looking to upgrade from my entry-level off-brand electric. If I could play the Hendrix version of Little Wing perfectly, they would get me my dream Les Paul '57 Reissue Gold Top. I had to play the intro perfectly, play all the rhythm parts while my mom sang it, then they gave me a bit of slack in the solos. I just had to solo in the right key and throw in some Hendrix licks.  I had one chance per week. Couldn't start over if I messed up at all.  It was extremely frustrating. I hated my shitty guitar and blamed mistakes on it. I played that song so many times, I can play it in my sleep. Took about 4 months of non-stop practice, but I finally nailed it from start to finish with licks/soloing in key that got me the green light.  15 years later, every time I sit down to play Ginger, my Gold Top, I start with that intro.  Don't worry about features like an autotuner and adjustable nut. You want an instrument with soul. An instrument that moves you enough to want to play all the time. But do yourself a favor and make sure you feel that you've earned the right to own such an instrument. It may sound absurd, but I can't help but believe that your guitar needs to respect you for it to really sing."

Guitar,3dyves,Dismalhead,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:33:24 2015 UTC,"If you have the cash, look at the lower model Gibson Les Pauls - the J, Special, Studio, and Junior. They're basically stripped down Les Pauls without the fancy finishes and binding. Still have pro quality pickups and parts. Try them out and feel how they play. You can find them on sale every once in a while for $600 to $800 at places like Guitar Center. I've seen used ones going for around $500.  Unless you don't have the cash, I don't recommend going the Epiphone route. There you get a fancy looking guitar that doesn't have high quality hardware or electronics. I picked up an Epiphone Les Paul Special recently and the pickups sounded like mud; total garbage. I replaced them after giving them a couple of weeks tryout. Also replaced the bridge and the tuners. Just realize than any Epiphone LP will be a fixer upper."
Guitar,3dyves,Dismalhead,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:41:40 2015 UTC,hmm. I like all les pauls in one way or another. i just wanted to know why some are good and some aren't. the auto-tuner and raisable nut and stuff like that in the 2015 make me really one one. but i'll just stick to saving money for a fender. its just the shape and finishes on a les paul. PHOAR
Guitar,3dyves,StarTrekMike,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:56:15 2015 UTC,"I was a Gibson guy for 25 years; Les Pauls and SGs. A couple of years ago I picked up a Telecaster, now I've only got my old SG and four Fenders."
Guitar,3dyves,zosorose,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:01:49 2015 UTC,"Well, I would advise that you start getting familiar with Les Pauls before anything else. I have absolutely no doubt that there are plenty of webpages that cover the history of the Les Paul, The various options available and even websites that explain the basics of choosing a electric guitar.  These are all just a google search away for you."

Guitar,3dyves,nickateen,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:46:01 2015 UTC,"First find out if they even work for you in the first place. Les Pauls are notoriously unergonomic (weight, balance, contours), go to a shop and compare them to other guitars.  Once you've done that and made sure, I'd look into classic spec models, as robot tuning etc. feels quite gimmicky to me. 70's Japanese lawsuit copies tend to be nice, brands like Burny, Yamaha, Ibanez, Greco. Epiphone's rather hit & miss but if you find a nice specimen then that can be a good deal.   Used Gibson is an alternative, but I wouldn't buy new, partly because they've allegedly declined quite a bit in quality while rising in price, and partly because of political reasons (allegedly horrendous working conditions, a crazy conservative CEO)."
Guitar,3dxdmz,DireWolf214,1 point,Mon Jul 20 09:11:09 2015 UTC,"If you're happy with the way the guitar plays and have limited funds, I'd recommend pickups. I actually purchased a base model RG8 and immediately ditched the stock pups for SD Nazgûl and Sentient. Guitar sounds great now. I run a SD JB and Jazz in my RG350MYE. Sounds great for metal. Ibanez makes some pretty shitty pickups."

Guitar,3dxdmz,GlamAdmin,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:36:33 2015 UTC,Modding is usually the way to go. You can make your guitar awesome for about 200 bucks (max). You can't buy a better guitar for that price.

Guitar,3dxdmz,GlamAdmin,1 point,Mon Jul 20 10:18:22 2015 UTC,"While a good speaker/cab upgrade can make a world of difference, replacing some shitty low end Ibanez pups will have a MUCH bigger effect, not to mention he can replace one pickup for under $100."
Guitar,3dxdmz,Jarvicious,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:27:12 2015 UTC,I personally disagree but that's OK :)
Guitar,3dxdmz,GlamAdmin,2,Tue Jul 21 09:36:08 2015 UTC,"Disagree with what?  The fact that one decent speaker costs upwards of $50-60 and even a well built, hand made cab costs $100 in parts or the fact that the pups are going to make far more of a difference when OP is playing metal and the speakers are going to be beat to shit by dirt pedals anyway?  Also, you just said ""2x12 cabinet"" with no other input which really doesn't add to the conversation.  Plus, OP didn't mention anything about what kind of cab he has so he may already be set."
Guitar,3dxdmz,Jarvicious,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:30:20 2015 UTC,"You do realise we are allowed to have differing opinions and there is no empirically correct answer, right? If he's playing a micro terror 8"" speaker (since he didn't specify I assume) then I personally think having a nice big cab would make more of a difference.  If you don't though, that's OK - it's just a different suggestion."
Guitar,3dxszx,ini-physik,7,Mon Jul 20 12:28:30 2015 UTC,"Electromagnetic would probably be the most technically accurate, as electricity and magnetism are really just two different faces of one force."
Guitar,3dxszx,RhoOfFeh,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:51:59 2015 UTC,"Electrical and magnetic forces are actually different forces (though both are the movement of electrons basically), but they're both in use in an electric guitar yes.

Guitar,3dxszx,bmbkicks,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:32:55 2015 UTC,when I was taught physics (only 2 years ago) we learned them as two separate but related forces.   Just out of curiosity how much did that physics textbook cost and (if you still have it laying around) when was it published?
Guitar,3dxszx,tonebreaker,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:12:09 2015 UTC,"Probably about $200, I think it was pretty recent too. Didn't really do much learning from it though, mostly just paid attention in class, so probably just an old-school teacher though."

Guitar,3dxszx,tonebreaker,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:49:16 2015 UTC,"They are not different forces, they the same force. Electromagnetism.

Guitar,3dxszx,bmbkicks,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:29:52 2015 UTC,"When you get further into physics, you learn some pretty neat things.  For example; what you thought was an electric field when you're stationary with respect to the field can become partly a magnetic field when your start moving with respect to it.  And what you thought was a magnetic field when you were moving with respect to it can become an electric field when you stop."
Guitar,3dxszx,pyrespirit,3,Tue Jul 21 12:12:17 2015 UTC,"But the output from the guitar is an electrical signal.  Electric motors use magnetism to drive the motion - but they're fueled by electricity.  Electromagnetism is one unified thing because of the fact that depending upon how you look at an electric field, it can appear as magnetic field, and depending upon how you look at a magnetic field, it can appear as an electric field."
Guitar,3dxszx,pyrespirit,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:45:48 2015 UTC,But wouldn't an acoustic guitar with condenser pickup be an electric guitar by that metric?
Guitar,3dxszx,pyrespirit,5,Mon Jul 20 12:47:32 2015 UTC,"Well if you want to get technical, from my understanding of condenser microphones it would be a piezoelectric system.  But it's still an acoustic, it just has a microphone built in - that doesn't change the way in which the sound is generated.  I think you're overthinking this a bit!"
Guitar,3dxszx,jo44_is_my_name,2,Mon Jul 20 12:49:38 2015 UTC,"I'd argue that electric and acoustic are not purely technical names based on technology used in the guitar.  More so, I'd say they relate to the style and construction of the guitar.  Anything more seems overly pedantic.  If was make a strat clone from scratch, and never route the body for pickups, and only ever played it acoustically, I still wouldn't call it an acoustic guitar, because it is not of that style."
Guitar,3dxszx,lippyjose,3,Mon Jul 20 14:46:55 2015 UTC,"And a tremolo bar should be called a vibrato bar, etc.  But it is what it is."
Guitar,3dxszx,tonebreaker,3,Mon Jul 20 15:28:42 2015 UTC,Electricity and magnetism aren't two different things though.  That's dated information.    Any relatively current textbook would tell you electricity and magnetism are both parts of a force called electromagnetism.
Guitar,3dxszx,RhoOfFeh,3,Mon Jul 20 17:17:15 2015 UTC,"And at high enough energy levels, electromagnetism unites with the weak force to give us the electroweak force.  The strong force and possibly gravity are thought to also be part of the same picture, but I don't think we have managed to prove that experimentally yet."

I've listened to way too many to find the exact episode but I'm going back through on the off chance that I can find it.  IIRC one of the guests even speculated that all of the fundamental forces may just be different faces of the same singular force.  EDIT: I'm a total layman, I just like to read science books."

This is a fairly old speculation in science. It's the phenomenon people are talking about when they talk about looking for a grand unified theory: finding a way to unify the three fundamental forces which are called ""gauge interactions,"" electomagnetism, strong and weak nuclear forces   (Warning, science: gauge interactions are interactions which don't vary under mathematical transformation. Gravity doesn't follow the same behaviour as electromagnetism, the strong or the weak force - as mass terms vary under gauge transformation)"
