How are the trails up there in general? How busy does it get on a weekday vs a weekend? I'd rent a bike, so I don't imagine there's much to be concerned about on that end."
MTB,3dzbkz,MakoDaShark,4,Mon Jul 20 19:48:46 2015 UTC,"I really do love MCBP. As far as the trails, there's a lot of variety; smooth flowy jump lines, nice mellow single/doubletrack, but where MCBP shines is the rocky rooty gnarly shit that seems to be the norm for the northeast, and some truly scary (at least for me) freeride features.  Weekdays are empty. I'll often pull in after work and get anxious that the park might be closed. It never is, just empty. It's definitely busier on the weekends, but the bike park itself is never ""crowded"". It's rare that I'll get stuck behind someone on a trail, or have to wait at the top of a run to get some space behind the next rider. However, the park itself is attached to Action Park, Mountain Creek's waterpark, so during the hot summer days the lot and lodge have a lot of waterpark patrons that seem like they're trying to get hit by a rider.  The park rents Specialized Demo 8s, last years 26"" for $110, this year's 650b for $130, but literally 100 feet down the road a shop called Ridetopia rents Cove bikes (I want to say the Shocker and another model, not positive) for $75.    Here's a PinkBike recap of the latest event run at Mountain Creek. The ProGRT course represents MCBP really well, a nice split between devious rock sections, tight sections through the woods, and fast flowy dirt.    Drop me a line if you end up riding the park!"
MTB,3dzbkz,MakoDaShark,0,Mon Jul 20 20:52:50 2015 UTC,"Finally got to watch the video. That's pretty sweet. The jump up to wooden walkway to the drop seemed pretty excessive to me, but I've only done XC with some small 2' jumps and drops. The rolling hills at the bottom were definitely my speed. Not so much a fan of rocks on my hardtail, but a FS might make that better."
MTB,3dzbkz,gcman47,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:00:37 2015 UTC,"The jump up to wooden walkway to the drop seemed pretty excessive to me   You know, I used to think the same thing, but I've come around.   First and foremost, it's really easy to hit. Just get your weight off the bike and it rolls right on. That being said, it is scary looking, which is useful to an extent. It's a great way of indicating to beginners ""Hey, this is not a regular bridge!""  But practically it's great for the obstacle since having to jump the bike even that little bit, you're forced to get onto the bridge with more speed than you might with a roll-on. Which is awesome, because casing the landing would be terrible."

MTB,3dzbkz,gcman47,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:08:24 2015 UTC,"Welcome to the MCBP club! So there is nobody, and when I say nobody I mean that the parking lot is empty along with all the trails, on a weekday.  Weekends it gets a little busier but its no whistler.  You can rent Demo 8s, great bikes I have ridden them.  They always run well and have true wheels etc.  Trails are prime.  There are crap loads of rock gardens, if that is what you like.  There are flow lines and jump lines.  Pretty much anything you want.  The easy trails are easy, skill learning trails that are really mellow, and the hard trails are very tech.  Salvation is one fun jump line! The first one off jump gets the blood flowing all the time, then the next wood feature (not sure the name) is very fun.  I nailed them last year (using March's camp) and it was so much fun.  If you want to hit either of the first 3 features here are some tips.  For the first on-off jump, go to the top of the last table top before the corner. It is perfect entry speed, you need to pedal a bit, but just go for it... You can go quite short with no real consequences.  The 2nd feature is just a ride over after the first jump.  The 3rd jump, line up with the big tree on the left during the corner and just go for it.  No pedaling or pull up needed, just nail it from the tree.    BTW, nice job /u/jlobes.

MTB,3dzbkz,gcman47,2,Mon Jul 20 22:09:52 2015 UTC,"I use the regular GoPro chesty mount flipped upside down. I tilt it upwards so I can fit 3 fingers between the bottom of the camera and the mount plate. The exact angle took a lot of trial and error, taking a test run and viewing the playback on your smartphone is a good way to do this.*  Then, when I put my hydropack on, the stablizing strap that goes across your chest should be on top of the Chesty mount plate, under the camera. I find that tightening this down snug does a lot to keep the camera from bouncing around.   Now if only I could figure out what that rattling noise is... I've padded everything in the case, I'm starting to think it might be the battery inside the camera, but that just sounds crazy.  *Also, the angle varies depending on what sort of riding you're doing. You might be better off with less tilt (more parallel to your chest) if you're going to be in the saddle a lot, more tilt if you're going to be in attack position a lot."
MTB,3dzbkz,AiHangLo,2,Mon Jul 20 22:17:29 2015 UTC,It's probably your camera mount. The quick release part where the base plate attaches to whatever arms you have on there. You have to stick the nose plug looking thing in there to stop the rattle.

I appreciate you talking about specific features rather than just posting general ""it shreds brah"" feelings.  My time on plus size tires kinda mimics you experience- the mismatch between the suspension and tire spring rate was definitely a killer.  Did you happen to notice any casing roll in the corners? I could definitely feel things getting squirmy, but traction was still there. Kind of an odd feeling, the bike hanging on and gripping, just not necessarily in the direction you're aiming.   Anyhoos, thanks for the review!"

MTB,3dyu9e,freedomweasel,3,Tue Jul 21 02:37:03 2015 UTC,"You could run regular 29er wheels/tires on that and still have a pretty nice, short chain stay bike, though couldn't you?  With the option to put the fatties on depending on the trail. Seems like a neat bike.  The only fat bike I've ridden was rigid, but it does seem like the fork and all the tire would cause some weird issues."

MTB,3dyu9e,ChristophColombo,3,Tue Jul 21 00:14:01 2015 UTC,"There's about 40mm difference between 29"" and 29+. 20mm = 0.8"".   That could be game over on some frames but as mentioned if the stock hieght is 13"" (which is ridiculous BTW) then no worries. Strange bike!"

MTB,3dyu9e,TheSRTgreg,3,Mon Jul 20 21:40:08 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the write-up. I've already decided to buy the Stache 9 when I replace my hard tail. My only question, do you feel like the suspension issues between the fork/tire could be remedied by tuning the fork?"
MTB,3dyu9e,pablosnazzy,5,Mon Jul 20 21:08:47 2015 UTC,I think some of it can be remedied by taking a couple hours to tinker with the fork yes. I really had a hard time understanding the ins and outs of the Magnum fork so I ended up just saying F'it lets go ride.  I'd be curious to know if Trek themselves had anything to offer when it came to setting up the suspension on the Stache.
MTB,3dyu9e,pablosnazzy,2,Mon Jul 20 21:39:03 2015 UTC,Just looked at Trek's suspension calculator and the Stache isn't available as an option. Probably have to call/e-mail them direct for advice or Manitou.
MTB,3dyu9e,d00ber,2,Tue Jul 21 01:31:28 2015 UTC,"Fork tuning, no. Something else might work though.  Tires are basically minimally damped springs with a spring rate that is waaayyy too fast for use in suspension, especially at lower pressures. The handoff between tire deflection and the moment the fork starts moving causes a big spike in the suspension forces, and dealing with it is actually one of the single biggest challenges in suspension design. Schwalbe's ProCore system was actually originally designed to help with this phenomenon, it had nothing to do with stopping flats. Now,  ProCore was originally aimed at the DH crowd who tend to run tires at higher pressure, and DH tires in general have extremely stiff sidewalls.  This means they are actually the least affected by the handoff spike, it's worse for lighter, flimsier tires, but DH racers in general demand more out of their suspension, and don't mind the weight hit.    A fat or mid-fat tire will have a much harder time dealing with the spike than a DH tire will, so in theory they'd benefit from a ProCore style system even more than a DH bike.  Right now, I don't think there's anything on the market that will really fit plus size tires, but maybe something is in the works."
MTB,3dyu9e,hurricanejosh,3,Tue Jul 21 01:41:32 2015 UTC,"The review sounds a little Jekyll and Hyde, but it's interesting to read a review that is a little more critical. I rode one last weekend and can't say I agree that it descended poorly, as a new rider I had no confidence issues going damn fast downhill. For me, it was a blast since it did anything I asked of it. As a newer rider, maybe I'm not asking all that much of it but I really enjoyed the confidence inspiring nature of the bike. The geometry problems on my current bike (Trek 4300 Disc) cause me lots of anxiety haha!"
MTB,3dyu9e,ChristophColombo,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:05:48 2015 UTC,I can see where you are coming from. The bike would make any newer rider feel very confident and they may not see some of the places I found it fell short. We all have different ride styles as well so all bikes are going to feel different from one rider to another.
MTB,3dyu9e,Pedaling,2,Mon Jul 20 18:22:23 2015 UTC,"The Stache is the one bike that actually makes me want to get a hardtail 29er bike.  I like that it can fit all wheel sizes, so if i want to put 27.5 + on it i can, which makes it a bit more attractive to me."
MTB,3dyu9e,PacoBedejo,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:06:20 2015 UTC,If thats the case I would recommend holding out another year to see if the full suspension version comes along. Those will be even more of a jack of all trades bike.

Pro tip #2: Occasionally use one of the cleaning tabs.  Takes five minutes (plus a couple minutes to rinse) and does a bang-up job of killing off anything that might have slipped through the cracks (and also seems to remove any funky smell/taste the bladder might have taken on).  +1 for the freezer trick!

MTB,3dx1tj,tyme,4,Mon Jul 20 19:42:28 2015 UTC,I used to do this with great success with my cheap Costco/High Sierra hydration pack. You just have to be careful (at least with the cheap ones) to blow the water out of the bite valve. I accidentally destroyed the bite valve on my High Sierra bladder because water froze inside and expanded. Now it leaks :/   Loving the Osprey though!
MTB,3dx1tj,geekworking,0,Mon Jul 20 07:37:27 2015 UTC,You don't need to freeze it. Refrigerator is cold enough to stop anything from growing.

MTB,3dx1tj,grantrules,18,Mon Jul 20 13:14:56 2015 UTC,Not to mention it's very hard to get potato salad through the bite valve. I'd recommend Apple sauce or a nice creamy mushroom soup

If you are riding XC with a short bar than they are still  plenty helpful for a short steep climb. The one problem I see though, is that there is no way you could ever grip those bar ends when they are standing straight up like that.

It's Colorado, so be prepared to climb, but remember it's worth it.  I'm from Denver, so most of what I know well is within an hour of there.   Betasso Preserve is always a solid beginner choice near Boulder. It's challenging in spots but generally nice flowing singletrack.  Centennial Cone out of Golden has a bit of a climb at the beginning, but suffer through that and there's a nice big loop of singletrack up there.   Buffalo Creek down south out of Pine Junction off HWY 285 has miles and miles of non-technical flowy singletrack. You can also camp there, though I've never done that.  Alderfor/Three Sisters near Evergreen is also fun and has beginner terrain.    Oh yeah, if you haven't ridden here before: Take lots of water, we're pretty much a desert. Dry air and altitude will dry you out (sunscreen too).

Granby Ranch bike park on the other side of Trail Ridge road is probably a good bet as well.  Lift access and not too serious.   Trestle has some intermediate  lines, but they're usually blown out and have lots of traffic (I find the black runs there to be easier in that sense :P).

MTB,3dz9ms,cptfeelings,2,Mon Jul 20 20:31:53 2015 UTC,"If you're not very good (as you put it, not me), I'd avoid Hall. It looks cool but that was really difficult for me out of Michigan, and I ride and consider myself in good shape. The terrain is just so different. A heads up since it tends to show up on the radar often"
MTB,3dz9ms,SwaggerSpice,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:09:18 2015 UTC,I just rode hall and picture rock for the first time last week...I live in Atlanta so we don't have super long climbs just tight wooded single track that rolls....the rocks and climbs are no joke...that shit was not easy...hall was the best trail I've ever ridden...I can't wait to move in November
MTB,3dz9ms,ScooterChamp,2,Mon Jul 20 20:32:24 2015 UTC,I took the technical descent up Hall...lol. Silly Michigan me
MTB,3dz9ms,theextremist04,2,Tue Jul 21 15:09:49 2015 UTC,"Fort Collins has some cool trails. I'd recommend the lower trails in Lory state park as they tend to be pretty flowy without to much climbing. If you're feeling adventurous you can head to Horsetooth Mountain, there's a lot more climbing and rocks there but the trails are a blast."
MTB,3e0k6j,Mattrix2,3,Tue Jul 21 00:57:25 2015 UTC,"Get something with interchangeable lenses. Most sunglasses like that come with 3 sets, dark, a medium yellow or red tint and a clear lens. The yellow/red lens is a much better option for wooded trails. There should be a number of Tifosi sunglasses in your price range, and I happen to love the AC Red lens that comes with many of their cycling sunglasses for MTBing."

MTB,3dzyla,monkeycondition,6,Mon Jul 20 22:06:14 2015 UTC,"No, you want the left hand thread of the left crank. Make an ""o"" with your fingers, then stick a pen in it to make a crude model of a crank end and pedal. Twirl the pen like your left hand pedal does while pedaling- what way does the end of the pen that would be threaded into the crank move? It's the opposite of the way the foot end of the pedal moves, due to a process called mechanical precession. If you did it the way you're suggesting, the pedal will unthread itself.    Fun bit of trivia- the first people to design crank threads with the left hand reverse threaded? The Wright Brothers."
MTB,3dzyla,TeKnOShEeP,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:23:28 2015 UTC,Its a phenominon called precession  Jobst Brandt via Sheldon Brown explains this well  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precession_(mechanical)  those links explain it far better then I can
MTB,3dzyla,PeanutbutterSamich,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:28:38 2015 UTC,"Ah, I see thanks everyone."
MTB,3dzyla,Smiff2,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:48:27 2015 UTC,different for bearings vs bushes?
MTB,3dzyla,razorblade7700,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:15:48 2015 UTC,To confuse things does this apply to a cantilevered situations like a bike pedal?
MTB,3dzyla,pynaple,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:38:47 2015 UTC,"Easy way to remember: right pedal threads right (clockwise looking at the outside of the crank arm), left pedal threads left (ccw)."
MTB,3dzyla,Kitty_Powers,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:30:26 2015 UTC,"or, both pedals screw in ""forward"", unscrew ""backwards"", in reference to the direction the bike is facing."
