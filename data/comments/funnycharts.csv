funnycharts,2v5djb,Tommy_like_wingie,3,Sun Feb 8 20:15:44 2015 UTC,"You can only get debt free by running a surplus to pay off your debt.  Even before 9/11 President GW Bush had cut taxes and provided a larger rebate because they were against the government running a surplus.  Then 9/11 happened and we fought two wars without raising taxes in order to pay for them.  Of course, it doesn't help that more contracts are cost plus than necessary (cost plus contracts being originally developed for research projects where the cost was impossible to guess, now it's used for way more projects) runs up the cost to the government."

funnycharts,2v5djb,trestl,13,Sun Feb 8 06:57:23 2015 UTC,"Back in the 90s, with the help of Rob Rubin, Clinton worked on balancing the budget. He succeeded and it was the first balanced budget in many years.  Even the Debt clock was turned off because it was thought that it was not needed anymore.   Although it sounds very good, there are many harsh criticisms mostly regarding that after the clintonomics boom, Fannie and freddie loans started, which started the bubble, which led to the 2008 economic collapse.  That being said, it may not be a balanced budget that is to blame, but more of a matter of people taking advantage of the good vibes economy.  I dont really know enough about economics to make a say either way on it, but here is the wikipedia page of clintons economic policy if you want to check out some more on it!  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_policy_of_Bill_Clinton"

funnycharts,2v5djb,MattieF,2,Tue Feb 24 16:44:27 2015 UTC,"Economic policy of Bill Clinton:       The Economic policies of Bill Clinton, referred to by some as Clintonomics (a portmanteau of Clinton and economics), encapsulates the economic policies of United States President Bill Clinton that were implemented during his presidency.  President Clinton oversaw a period of considerable economic growth and expansion during his tenure. In particular, real GDP per capita increased from about $38,000 in 1994 to about $45,000 in 2001 (in real 2011 dollars).  The U.S. national debt as a percent of GDP also declined from about 66% to about 56% during Clinton's government.

funnycharts,2v5djb,jimIII,6,Sun Feb 8 01:32:56 2015 UTC,Yeah. Looks like you dont remember the 90s and you dont remember the economic conditions actually becoming much better due to a strong push for the budget reform.  Not to mention this was a bipartisan push you idiot.
funnycharts,2v5djb,Pewkie,1 point,Sun Feb 8 05:46:43 2015 UTC,Bipartisan - so very true. No way a balanced budget would pass without bipartisan support.
funnycharts,2v5djb,Talador12,1 point,Sun Feb 8 18:47:57 2015 UTC,"Economic conditions improved because of the invention of a new industry, the internet. They also bubbled. A recession was brewing on the horizon when Bush came into office. 9/11 and tax cuts staved it off. If it weren't for the housing bubble bursting we might have made it through. Instead the delayed recession from the late 90s combined with the housing burst to form the Great Recession we all know and love."
funnycharts,2v5djb,ZeroSumHappiness,1 point,Fri Jun 12 15:22:18 2015 UTC,"I am not too sure if the internet was big enough at that time to warrant the amount of economic progress that was made in the early-mid 90s. There was still only around a million users on the internet by the time the budget was balanced.  With that all being said, I am not too sure as to whether or not clinton actually did cause a huge boom in the economy. It was just a healthy economy then.   Investing in education and investing in new industries/destroying protectionist tarriffs definitely is never a bad move."
funnycharts,2v5djb,Pewkie,5,Fri Jun 12 15:37:18 2015 UTC,Do you even remember GW Bush's campaign promises to spend the theoretical budget surplus that didn't even exist yet?  He got elected on that shit you idiot.
funnycharts,2v5djb,croana,1 point,Sun Feb 8 09:14:43 2015 UTC,"The U4 counts people who gave up looking for work, the U5 adds in people who have a reason they have not looked for work recently, the U6 counts those who want to work more than they are.   All that's left is people who have no intention of looking for a job. Why would you count people who do not want to work, in unemployment?   At best, I could see justifying a ""U7"", people who do not want work, but would consider taking a job if a good opportunity came along."
