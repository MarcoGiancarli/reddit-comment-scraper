They had been promised amnesty if they would surrender.[24] This is considered one of the largest massacres in the Civil War    he [lenin] sent a telegram to Vladimir Smirnov stating ""I am surprised that you are taking the matter so lightly, and are not immediately executing large numbers of strikers for the crime of sabotage    ""Merciless war against the kulaks!

The side which promises the most meaning tends to get a lot of support.   I do not begrudge these people -- and I propose that disentangling ourselves from their struggles is not just the right answer, but it is respectable.

Their systematic theology was so ridiculous to me.  Through High School I thought that Buddhism was the answer, but once I actually looked into it in college I realized I disagreed with it just as much as I did with Christianity.   For a long time I thought that I had to take on a life long spiritual journey to find all the answers I was looking for. Eventually I began to research the history of the early church and realized the Law of Moses was never abolished and the apostles intended us to follow all 613 commandments to the best of our ability.   I began to take on the daunting task of following all the commandments (still in that process), and it was looking into Judaism that I discovered Jewish Kabbalah. It was here  that I realized all the questions I thought I had to answer on my own have already been answered thousands of years ago, and it's all in the texts of Kabbalah.    So my advice would be take a look into Kabbalah, and research the conflict between Paul, and James the brother of Jesus. It's interesting stuff."

I wish more atheist where more honest about their position and stop calling themselves atheist but anti-theist.

Over the course of a month my anxieties started coming out to the point where I was on my bed with my gun.  I almost committed suicide.  Last thing I said was ""God take control of my life"".  At that point a peace came over(Phil 4:7) me that I cannot explain except to say that it was God.  Also the spiritual blindness was lifted and I could really see the repercussions of my actions.  Most people who call themselves Christians never experience this.  I find that sometimes people need to be brought to the end of themselves.  All the religions listed above are work based.  As far as I am concerned, Jesus did the work when he died on the cross.

So many appeals to heretical sources combined with rank and willful misinterpretation of a few scriptures combined with extremely tendentious argumentation. It shows how the human intellect can twist anything into anything.  Not only did Paul state that it is appointed for all men to die once, but reincarnation is fundamentally opposed to the very concept of immortality.  For example, if I am a man who loves my beloved wife Sally, but I was Napoleon in a past life, and my wife and I die, in the afterlife will I reunite with my beloved wife Sally or will I reunite with Josephine? Will Sally have been born again as Jill, a woman who doesn't give a damn about me but loves her husband Max?  In this scenario I am a mere blip in the existence of my eternal soul, who I know nothing about. I could be a severe jackass. Josephine could be some bitch. At least until she turns into Sarah, or even Bill, who I know nothing of. I have no idea what my soul will make of my life. Perhaps it will disagree with me about things I've done being good or bad.  Reincarnation is no immortality at all, but was recognized by Buddha and the Vedantists and their predecessors as a miserable curse of forgetfulness and meaninglessness. Modern new agers cling to reincarnation because to them it is preferable to hell. In the ancient world reincarnation was used to support dharma, which itself was concocted to support a caste society. Reincarnation is loved by those who need to be able to distance themselves from the consequences of who they are so much that they are willing to trash immortality in general. It is certainly not biblical or Christian in any intellectual sense."

But I am perplexed that otherwise intelligent people would opt for the doctrine of eternal damnation, which to me is blasphemous in the extreme because of what it says about God:   That the all-knowing God who knows everyone's fate before it comes to be would eternally torture people (Do we really grasp the enormity of eternity?) for temporal transgressions, creating them for this fate. That God wishes us well, but is powerless to help us once we transgress and pass the portal of death. That God has no idea of what we will choose, but is content with our being consigned to eternal flames if we flub our choices.   You can see that if people are offered only these choices about God, that many say ""no thanks"" and choose atheism.  But this is not the truth about God. And the ""one chance, eternal consequences"" doctrine is not Christian at all, in my estimation. I could refer you to some pretty convincing writings were you open to them.  I do not write this to accuse, but only to present how your views appear to others. As to what you consider immortality to be, I think you sell yourself short by aspiring to such an earthly concept.

I wouldn't describe the USSR or Nazi Germany as particularly secular, but both did try to remove religion (or planned to), I realise that it isn't the same as what we have today but you can't deny the similarities: Nationalistic views rising in Russia and the U.S.; proxy wars with either side being supported by a different superpower; Europe struggling with a debt crisis while the U.K strives to be relevant; ethnic differences and questioning of the value of immigrants; tensions in the Middle East; Russian aggression in Eastern Europe; Switzerland staying out of foreign affairs; tensions between Finland and Russia; Iran in crISIS and racial tension in the US. It seems, to an outsider, that America has too many problems of it's own and may start to destabilise, and rather than having a strong United religious people, the U.S. Has huge numbers of secularists and atheists causing religious arguments and causing infighting. This leaves Europe with no strong, familiar and foreign ally to rely on. With the current instability in the EU and the rising power of China and Japan, Russia is starting to look more dependable than America; sure Putin is a corrupt scumbag but he gets things done meanwhile I see posts everyday online about how much of a bad situation America is currently in, with its constitution under question and lots of hate for Obama.

There are also things like capitalism or technological alienation.  And the US never had foreign policy or alliances that had anything to do with religion so much as economic interests.

Article with good reference links HERE about the state's supreme court ordering a Catholic priest to testify in court about the suspect's confession.  As far as the Catholic Church is concerned, whatever is said in the confessional is between the confessor, the priest, and God.  Period.  Quite a few priests chose jail over revealing a person's confession.    If a priest hears a confession, for example, from someone who committed murder...the priest would most likely attempt to convince the confessor to turn himself/herself in to police.

Morally the clergy member should be compelled to report the parishioner. The relationship is considered to be similar to doctor patient privilege but laws may vary by state as to whether or not that is technically the case. According to www.childwelfare.gov clergy are mandated reporters when it comes to child abuse (https://www.childwelfare.gov/pubPDFs/clergymandated.pdf).

The interpreter, if there is one, and all others who in any way have knowledge of sins from confession are also obliged to observe secrecy.  Can.  984 Â§1.

However, the priest should also do everything he can to encourage that person to make amends for their sins as best they can. In the case of theft it could be returning the stolen object, in a case of murder it would be turning yourself in.  The purpose of confession is to forgive sins. Jesus gave the apostles the power to forgive sins (See John 20:23) and they passed that authority down to the priests and bishops of today through apostolic succession."

Your word is confidential unless future intent is shown. And they cannot be subpoenaed for a Courts Martial. Its not applicable to all circumstances, but I just thought I'd throw in my two cents."
religion,3dm0xo,TacosArePeopleToo,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:56:34 2015 UTC,"The answer to your question is that it is going to differ depending on denomination, state/country, and circumstance. In general, priest-penitent confidentiality is the strongest form of confidentiality there is - stronger than doctor-patient privilege or attorney-client privilege. In the U.S. This has to do with the separation of church and state issues. For instance, to be a licensed doctor you have to meet AMA standards and the standards of the state you are practicing in. So the state determines the standards without opposition. In the case of clergy, non-state actors, denominations and church groups, determine the standards. In the case of the Vatican, the ""denomination"" is actually a foreign country with its own head of state. Additionally the U.S. Constitution strongly weakens the state in its ability to legislate the churches. Unlike other forms of privileged communication, priest-penitent confidentiality is often unregulated statutorily and determined by common law. Where there are statutes, they are often ignored and those who ignore them often win, get the laws thrown out, etc.  Basically, there is no form of confidentiality that is stronger in principle, but many individual clerics don't care much for it and report at the drop of a hat. Others take it very seriously under certain circumstances. Catholic priests report freely unless it is during the sacrament of confession, for example.  Hopefully this is enough to indicate to you that it is a very grey area. Personally, I would consider a Baptist preacher no different than a psychologist, but a RC priest during confession is probably the strongest confidentiality on earth. Now that Baptist may feel personally morally obligated to keep a planned crime or child abuse secret even though his denomination has no concept of priest-penitent confidentiality. If he would refuse to report or testify, he would likely get away with it but it's not certain. There are a lot of specific circumstances that have not yet played out to the fullest extent in the courts. Usually because Baptists are fairly willing to comply with state laws. Only the unusual doctrinal position of the RCC during confession has prompted clergy to keep instances of planned crimes and child abuse secret.  So clear as mud, right?"
religion,3dm0xo,Madmonk11,1 point,Sat Jul 18 08:38:15 2015 UTC,"Also, the example of the Louisiana statutory rape case that the other commenter linked is one of those unusual cases I mention above.

Sticky stuff. My guess is that the priest will win and cannot be forced to testify and any testimony will be deemed inadmissible. But it may take a U.S. Supreme Court decision to get there."
religion,3dm0xo,Madmonk11,1 point,Sat Jul 18 09:06:43 2015 UTC,"To answer your last question about going to God directly, I will copy paste the stance of the Bahai faith:  To none is it permitted to seek absolution from another soul # 34  BahÃ¡âuâllÃ¡h prohibits confession to, and seeking absolution of oneâs sins from, a human being. Instead one should beg 194 forgiveness from God. In the Tablet of BishÃ¡rÃ¡t, He states that âsuch confession before people results in oneâs humiliation and abasementâ, and He affirms that God âwisheth not the humiliation of His servantsâ.    Shoghi Effendi sets the prohibition into context. His secretary has written on his behalf that we     â¦are forbidden to confess to any person, as do the Catholics to their priests, our sins and shortcomings, or to do so in public, as some religious sects do. However, if we spontaneously desire to acknowledge we have been wrong in something, or that we have some fault of character, and ask another personâs forgiveness or pardon, we are quite free to do so.     The Universal House of Justice has also clarified that BahÃ¡âuâllÃ¡hâs prohibition concerning the confession of sins does not prevent an individual from admitting transgressions in the course of consultations held under the aegis of BahÃ¡âÃ­ institutions. Likewise, it does not preclude the possibility of seeking advice from a close friend or of a professional counsellor regarding such matters."

And he also talks about more things and in greater detail.  Atheists can harp on the same things over and over again in Christianity because it is more likely they've read the Bible.

However not all the earth was flooded. It's possible that Noah was only in an area that had no mountain tops or land sticking out.

If you imagine it from an atheist's perspective, it's a bit like when you're a kid and you're having a discussion about Santa Claus.  If you don't believe in Santa and you're talking with someone who does, you get the feeling they just haven't figured it out yet.  It's a cop-out to just say the believer is an idiot, which many atheists might say.  But I realize that beliefs are a product of the culture one grows up in.  Doesn't mean anyone's an idiot.      However, it's not like 'religion' is going out there helping the world.  It's often perceived as divisive and has a long history of conflicts.   It could be argued that 'religion' is a man-made plague that has been holding us back forever.  In this sense, non-believers look at this and get frusterated...they bash religion because it feels like religion bashes humanity.  I don't think atheists would mind so much if people weren't constantly killing people in the name of religion.    But, it does no good to bash opposing viewpoints/beliefs.  It doesn't change anyone's minds and it only creates further resentment.

This means that reality is suspended in order to get the moral across and is not mean to be taken literally. It was a miracle. This happened because of God's hand in it and unless God wills it, it will never happen again.   However, I think it is important to keep in mind how many, many times our modern bibles have been translated over centuries. Also, the vernacular that some bibles use is also different from the first English-Language bibles as languages change from generation to generation.

The Hebrew Bible was compiled primarily during the Babylonian exile, and was a way to understand the WHY of it all. The conclusion, which plays out over many stories, poems, laws and accounts, is that the Hebrews hadn't behaved properly toward their god.   There are many cycles of law, disobedience and punishment - Noah's story is one of these, as is Moses' death outside of the promised land and the exile itself.   The Flood story also establishes the covenant, which plays a key role throughout the Hebrew Bible, and marks a turning point in humanity (people live more or less normal lifespans after Noah and his immediate descendants)."

I am guessing it's a combination of not questioning it and not knowing enough science for adults. I bet there is more to it than that. For instance, not knowing what year we're talking about. And maybe because the bible is not taught along with out world events at the same time, it's focus includes such a small part of the world, that it may be easy to take the story out of context.   Now, I don't believe in the literal interpretation of the bible. Not to get into why, but I believe it is meant to guide us. (Not that are belief systems match up perfectly nowadays with what the bible is saying).

religion,3ded56,CadmeusCain,5,Wed Jul 15 16:45:35 2015 UTC,"Let me try to add some context, and then I'll try to answer your question.  First, there's one factual matter I wish to raise.  Most Christians reject Islam and Mohammad, but not the other way around.  In fact, the Quran specifically recognizes Christ and Moses as Prophets of God and requires Muslims to treat Christians and Jews well since they're 'people of the book'.  Muslims regard their God the same as the Christian and Jewish God.  Christians consider Christ to be God, which is different from what Jews think of course, but Christians also consider Moses as a Prophet (or Saint) and would identify God as described by Moses as their own (namely Christ).  Also, Jews, Christians, Muslims and Baha'is recognize in common some other Prophets like Adam, Noah, Issac, Jacob and Abraham.  Okay -- back to your question, answered with some Baha'i context.  We regard several of the major religions -- Hinduism, Buddhism, Judaism, Christianity, Islam, Zoarastrianism, and others -- as originating with Prophets from one God.  We also recognize that there have been other Prophets who have come to humanity at different times and places, but the details have been lost over time (they make account for some Animistic religions, for example).  The purpose of God in creating different religions is to address the needs of different places at different times.  In this way, God means for religion to evolve.  In this context, your question suggests its own answers.  Perhaps when cultures/civilizations were isolated from each other, it didn't make sense to try to explain that there's one God that we all worship; it was just easier to use multiple Gods as a metaphor for the sake of unity.  But, at a greater stage of human evolution, God wishes mankind to recognize him as one and all-powerful; that which has been worshiped throughout history by different peoples is single.  And, this concept that God is one, and that all worship the same God, can be a unifying power.  One day, perhaps, all the peoples of the earth will find unity through recognizing that these major religions are worshiping the same unknowable essence -- and that the commands of virtue, morality and peace from all these Prophets will be the building block of a new world civilization.  This is, essentially, the message of the Baha'i Faith: that God is one, that the religions are one, and that mankind is one.  It promises the future ""Most Great Peace"" of the world, a permanent end to war, founded on a universal understanding of these onenesses.  It doesn't mean everyone will worship or believe the same thing, but it will mean that we accept the differences we have.  It also makes sense for this message to come to mankind now, at a time when suddenly the world has found itself unified through electronic communication, and now has the potential to achieve a level of unity that couldn't be conceived of a few hundred years ago.  That's a pretty intellectually-satisfying survival advantage and a much nicer place than the world has ever had... we just might need to wait a thousand years according to Baha'i texts :)  A few last points.  You're right that in past Abrahamic traditions there's heavy sexism in the religious writings.  But, I don't think that's inherent in monotheistic belief.  The Baha'is, for sure, believe in the equality of men and women, and so do progressive denominations of Christianity (for example).    Also, there's many volumes that Baha'u'llah (the Prophet of the Baha'i Faith) has written on these topics, and I've only scratched the surface.  Sometimes Baha'is are accused of trying to say ""every religion is 100% true to reality!"", which obviously wouldn't make sense.  So, there's lots more detail out there and I can point you to references if you're interested."

In fact, the Quran specifically recognizes Christ and Moses as Prophets of God and requires Muslims to treat Christians and Jews well since they're 'people of the book'. Muslims regard their God the same as the Christian and Jewish God.   Thanks for the explanation. I am an ex-Muslim so much of this is familiar to me. Muslims do accept the Christian God Yahweh as the same guy as Allah, but they reject Christianity's central teaching: which is that Jesus was sacrificed on the cross, died, and was brought back to life to pay the penalty for original sin. I realize that it is a later development that Christ was Yahweh in human form but this is also a mainstream teaching that Islam rejects. The only way Islam actually 'accepts' Jesus is as a Jewish prophet; which is nothing like how Christians see him at all.  My understanding ends at the Bahai faith, however. I have little contact or knowledge of it. If I wanted to learn more, is there a central text roughly equivalent to the Quran or the Bible? I've heard of the Kitab al-Aqdas, but I'm not sure if this has the same function.

Have Bahais every been involved in any major religious wars? And have they ever persecuted anyone? I realize that there are some issues with Baha'ullah's Messianic claims when investigated from the perspective of Judaism, Christianity or Islam; but from an aesthetic perspective, it sounds appealing and provides satisfying explanations (from a literary perspective) to some questions that really stump most Abrahamics (why did God only show up in the Middle East?). Why aren't there more people Bahais lol?   Also, there's many volumes that Baha'u'llah (the Prophet of the Baha'i Faith) has written on these topics, and I've only scratched the surface.

So, there's lots more detail out there and I can point you to references if you're interested.   Sure, I'd be interested! Although do understand that I'd be exploring the religion from an academic perspective, so no missionary/conversion material. To believe in the Bahai faith one needs to implicitly believe that the revelations prior were, in part, true. That God really was talking to Muhammad or Abraham or Jesus; which I don't think any skeptic can ever really believe."
religion,3ded56,aibiT4tu,2,Thu Jul 16 09:47:37 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the clarifications on the Islamic perspective on Christ.  The details are helpful for me to keep in mind.   ""If I wanted to learn more, is there a central text roughly equivalent to the Quran or the Bible?""   The main theological work is the Kitab-i-ÃqÃ¡n, and it's a good place to start.  The primary theme is progressive revelation, this evolution of the religions, and mankind's acceptance/rejection of the Prophets.  It was revealed to respond to questions by an uncle (a Muslim) of The BÃ¡b, who the BahÃ¡'Ã­s also regard as a Prophet.  The Kitab-i-Aqdas indeed translates to the ""Most Holy Book"".  It's all about laws (many of which are for a future world civilization) and requires a lot of context to reason about.. so we normally don't recommend starting there.  Most of the authoritative English translations of Baha'u'llah's writings are here.   ""...almost though as it Pluralism is a tenet of faith...""   Well, the BahÃ¡'Ã­ perspective is that these Prophets are mouthpieces of one God, and we believe in an absolute reality.  We also believe that human comprehension of this reality is an evolutionary process.  So, just because someone thinks or says something, doesn't make it true.  And, just because someone claims to be a Prophet, doesn't make it true.  The individual Baha'i is free to think what they wish about a particular religion not mentioned in the Baha'i Writings, which gives us a lot of breathing room to say, ""well, maybe it was divinely inspired"" -- or to make a more opinionated stand that it was or wasn't.  For an extreme example, all Baha'is I know choose to reject ""Scientology"" as having any kind of divine inspiration (but this isn't required by the Faith; I don't think there's an ""official"" perspective on it).    So, I wouldn't say that the Baha'i Faith takes pluralism as a tenant, since that could imply that we only believe in a relative personal reality rather than an absolute one.  This is in contrast to Unitarian Universalists, for example, where the seven principles doesn't specify whether reality is absolute or relative (and this is left to an individual's choice as well).   ""Have Bahais every been involved in any major religious wars?""   Nope.   ""And have they ever persecuted anyone?""   Nope.  Baha'is have always been (and still are) persecuted on Iran.  But we've always been on that side.   ""Why aren't there more people Bahais lol?""   In part because it's young and we don't proselytize :)  (Or, at least not in a conventional nor aggressive manner).  The Faith started in the mid-1800s in Iran, yet it does have wide geographical spread.  One of the things BahÃ¡'u'llÃ¡h discusses in the Kitab-i-ÃqÃ¡n is how the institutions of religions are in peril; and it doesn't take much perusing of news to see how true this is today.  With the plethora of NRMs, the destruction caused by extremists, and the divisions within large religious traditions, it's easy to see why skeptics would be suspicious of any new religion; it's almost impossible to see its value today.  In the Kitab-i-Aqdas it says that the Baha'i dispensation will last at least 1000 years before the next Prophet, so there's plenty of time to sort this out!"

This I think is pretty easy to demonstrate as inaccurate. Firstly, within polytheistic religions worshipping other gods within a pantheon is frequently acceptable (though some cults might not be, see modern Hinduism). However, what happens when two pantheons meet?  Usually, violence. So polytheism is just larger scale. Instead of saying ""my god is greater than your god"" you are saying ""my pantheon of gods is greater than your pantheon of gods""  2) that polytheism is more liberal and less sexist  Once again, you need only look at Hinduism. Especially historically and still some to this day, Hinduism has had a huge issue with sexism. Arabs before Muhammad were largely pagan, and also had a very oppressive view of women. Islam, a monotheistic religion, helped liberate them... Somewhat.  Of course this is not to say that polytheistic religions are more oppressive. Rather I would say it's much more complicated of a picture than one being worse than the other. Also animism is an entirely different issue anthropologically.   Finally I would like to note that, at it's core, religion is a search for truth. Polytheism may be true, monotheism may be true, but one is not superior to the other except in which you believe to be more true."
religion,3ded56,Dragearen,7,Wed Jul 15 18:44:23 2015 UTC,"However, what happens when two pantheons meet? Usually, violence.   Yes, there are wars of expansion and things like that, true of any civilization. But ""they worship false gods"" tended not to be used as justification. And in practice, deities got borrowed into pantheons. Some of the most popular deities in the Roman Empire were the Egyptian goddess Isis and the Greco-Egyptian god Serapis. The Egyptians borrowed foreign deities into their pantheon, like the Semitic deities Anat, Reshep, and Qetesh.  The Mediterranean Basin (as well as Europe more broadly) was home to temples to many different gods of different cultures. that since became home to churches to the same god, with the occasional synagogue, and then later, mosques. It is rather like having an aquarium with many different kinds of fish of different colors, leaving for the weekend, and coming back to find only one kind of fish of the same color, or maybe two or three kinds of fish of the same shade.  However people considered other people's gods (something that varied between ""all just different gods"" and ""different names for a universal set of gods""), the attitude toward other gods--even other pantheons was not the same.   EDIT: No things weren't hunky-dory all the time, but they were more flexible and less exclusivist than you seem to think.   I don't have a problem with your other two points."
religion,3ded56,Sihathor,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:08:19 2015 UTC,It seems I'm guilty of a bit of hypothesizing just like OP. Thanks for the corrections.
religion,3ded56,Sihathor,2,Thu Jul 16 06:13:23 2015 UTC,"No problem. It is more complex, even if your points about polytheistic religions and interactions with other religions missed the mark. I do appreciate the point you made about sexism. I think that:   Religion does play a role in shaping attitudes toward the sexes, as well as gender and sexuality. But that there are probably more fundamental factors at work. I am especially interested in things like environment and type of agriculture. I read a thing somewhere (I'll try to hunt it down) about societies whose staple crop must be plowed (like wheat) developing greater gender inequality than those whose staple doesnt require plowing, like millet, because of the upper body strength of men advantages them in plowing. That such attitudes can get baked into a society or religion even long after they have been found to lack justification, if they ever had."

Instead of saying ""my god is greater than your god"" you are saying ""my pantheon of gods is greater than your pantheon of gods""   Fair point. Although is there not an inherent appreciation for diversity? i.e. that many Gods within this Pantheon are worthy in their own way?   Once again, you need only look at Hinduism. Especially historically and still some to this day, Hinduism has had a huge issue with sexism. Arabs before Muhammad were largely pagan, and also had a very oppressive view of women. Islam, a monotheistic religion, helped liberate them... Somewhat.   Fair points. I'd agree with much of this.  God any book suggestions for me? You seem quite well informed."

Let me know if you do find any interesting books though because it is an interesting topic."
religion,3ded56,fight_collector,4,Wed Jul 15 20:04:23 2015 UTC,"Neither. The notion of ""going forward"" is itself an idea derived from monotheistic religions with linear time that had since become secularized.   Also, this idea of ""going forward or going backwards"" doesn't allow for the option of ""a new state that is worse than the previous state""."
religion,3ded56,voidgazing,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:11:14 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the post. Something I'm realizing is that I'm using the word 'progression' or 'forward' when I should be talking about a 'development' or a 'change'. I think it's possibly also an offshoot from scientific thinking where there is a desire to outdo what was done previously.   So then perhaps a better question is: ""Is the state of predominant polytheism better or worse than predominant monotheism in terms of people living together, tolerating each other, creating fair societies and being more in line with reality""."
religion,3ded56,fight_collector,2,Thu Jul 16 08:26:55 2015 UTC,"This idea, or even myth (in the non-pejorative sense of ""story that gives meaning"") of progress is very pervasive in our society. Many do not notice it any more than the proverbial fish is aware of the water it swims in.  ""Development"" and ""change"" are better, more neutral.  To answer your reformulated question:   I think that a given society being fair and tolerant (leaving aside ""in line with reality"" for the moment) requires many factors, not just religion, factors that I would say are more fundamental than religion, like economic or political structure, resources, climate and the like. That said, however, I think a polytheistic view--or something  like ""the many gods are just guises of one God""  (a more inclusive monotheism than the ""our way or the highway"" kind) is a better match for a pluralistic society than a monotheistic religion where all things must be subordinated to one God, one church, etc."

Whereas before we saw the different aspects of nature as distinct and separate from one another, and assigned each aspect its own separate deity, monotheism signalled the realization that all natural forces are actually aspects of a single all-pervasive Nature.   As for the social implications, I don't think we can point to monotheism as the source of intolerance and sexism. Spirituality, myth, culture, and organized religion all influence each other.

Also on the chart the makers have put a disclaimer about the vague nature on the origins of some of the faiths. Obviously those that posted the chart in /r/bad_religion didn't read that disclaimer.

Anthropology, for example, is not at a consensus about what the earliest religions being pantheistic. It was mostly a late 19th century presumption that they were but more and more anthropology has created more and more controversy on the topic. Also, early Indo-Iranian mythology actually has a lot in common with early Hellenic, Germanic, and Celtic mythology because thy were all descendant of the same language group (i.e. the Indo-Europeans). The mythologies diverged quickly but to say that early Indo-Iranian religion has more in common with Semitic mythologies than European is a big presumption simply based on geographical proximity. Also, Gnosticism and the stuff that came after it were products of Christian heresy just as much they were Neoplatonism, and should be listed with them. Catharism was an openly blatant about its asserted Christian origins much in the same way Mormonism has been. Bogomilism was much the same but was started in the Eastern Roman Empire and never moved far from that region (or anywhere, for that matter. Not believing in having kids kind of kills a religion after a few generations). And don't get me started on the grouping of Shinto with Taoism and Confucianism. You are not allowed to over-complicate Western Religions and then over-simplify Chinese Religions simply for mistaking under-exposure with a lack of complexity. Religion is a complex monster. It is a giant force anthropologists still struggle with explaining. Simply slapping a few labels and dates does not even begin to explain its history and diversity.   https://www.reddit.com/r/bad_religion/comments/244clt/the_family_tree_of_religions/  The problem isn't uncertain origins, its more like continuing to promote pop anthropology from the 19th century, and ignore the past 60 years of religious anthropology."

I would put the chart in the same catagory as the ""March of Progress"" image on the evolution of man which is not accurate because evolution was not linear however it does get one thinking and hopefully broaden one's view (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/March_of_Progress). A more accurate evolution chart would probably look like this image (http://i.imgur.com/bOsCd.gif) not only on the evolution of Life but also of Religions.

That's a big mistake. At least in the case of ancient Egypt, it wasn't ""Thoth says to zig, Osiris says to zag, and Sobek says to eat live ducks whole."" There's a cosmic order, ma'at, which all the gods (and in fact, humans as well) participate in, for the flourishing of the ordered cosmos and the people in it. That's not arbitrary. That's the opposite of arbitrary. I don't know exactly how other ancient or modern polytheistic religions see this, but I wouldn't be surprised if there was/is something similar.

The powers and properties of the Gods (parsu/me) which enable a whole host of activities (giÅ¡-hur) central to civilized human life -- especially but not exclusively, religion -- to be established and function within a fluid and dynamic but nevertheless ordered Creation.  As in Egyptian religion with its central moral-ethical priniciple, ma'at, in Mesopotamian religions, it likewise possesses and expresses a relational ontology. All beings, particularly Gods and humans, engage in a network that is ecologically (since the Gods are, among many other things, immanent), morally-ethically, and ""spiritually"" linked. Their worldview was much more holistic than you'll find in comparatively Modern monotheistic religions. It's not ""one God says this; another says that; you must observe one thing or another; can't have and serve two masters,"" etc. etc. ad infinitum et nauseam.    Based on this, and not having found anything sounding remotely like the confused additive monotheistic caricature of polytheism in real life, I'm going to say something like this (like ma'at or parsu/me) was likely the case in many places."

religion,3ded56,TaylorS1986,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:53:28 2015 UTC,I didn't say that they have to. It's observed history that religious ideas change and develop over time. Monotheism has become immensely popular over the last 3000 years. It doesn't show up very often before then.
religion,3ded56,toolfan73,5,Wed Jul 15 19:50:08 2015 UTC,Of course when you forcibly spread a religion through violence and threats of economic ruin it probably should be attributed to popularity...........
religion,3ded56,PickiestGamer,-1,Wed Jul 15 23:06:38 2015 UTC,"I think there are several problems you don't see, or skip over. One is that monotheism is philosophically more pleasing than polytheism. Plato demonstrates in the Euthyphro that morality cannot be placed in a polytheistic context. This is the point of the Euthyphro dilemma. It is interesting that throughout philosophical traditions, including Hindu, that monotheism has been the rule, not the exception.  Also, as others have pointed out, you neglect to take into account not only inter-pantheon diputes, but also intra-pantheon accounts. Not all devotees of Apollo were cool with devotees of Athena, for instance. And many cults were forbidden and persecuted. Jews and Christians were persecuted by polytheistic Romans.  I would also suggest you take another look at Islam, and how accommodating it has been toward other faiths until the modern era, when deviants became the most vocal and forceful."
religion,3ded56,fight_collector,3,Wed Jul 15 20:38:06 2015 UTC,"Did we read the same Euthyphro?  The issue in Euthyphro was the definition of what ""goodness"" (read the text, he refers to goodness after discussing piety) is, and whether ""goodness"" is ""good"" because the divine say it is good, or because the divine are comprised of ""goodness."" If ""goodness"" is something that the divine are not arbitrarily, then it is something all things - including the divine! - can be measured as. If ""goodness"" is something the divine are inherently then it's not something that can be used as a measurement.  The point of Euthyphro was not to disprove the validity of polytheism. Especially as Plato was a polytheist living in a polytheist culture. He was a philosopher. He wanted people to think and to question themselves and what they automatically accepted as the way things were, he wanted them to think about the meanings behind words, about life here and after. It always astounds me when non-polytheistic groups claim Plato is in favor of their points (monotheists saying for monotheism, atheists saying for atheism) because Plato was, in their minds, a closet monotheist/atheist.  The Good or Great Good that Plato describes in the various works we have access to is not a being capable of being worshiped, it's something above the divine, that is beyond full mortal perception... though not for Plato's lack of trying, that's for certain.    As for the persecutions by the polytheistic Romans of the Jews and Christians...   Jews were not persecuted the whole time in Rome. They arrived in Rome most notably in 161 BCE, and their persecution started after 37 CE. From 37 CE to 200 CE Jews were persecuted by Roman polytheists. This is almost an equal amount of time in which they were persecuted, with more time spent of them not being persecuted. (198 years no persecution, 163 years persecution) Christians were persecuted for a similar time period as the Jews. When Rome became a Christian country/nation, persecution of the Jews persisted, and persecution of the Roman polytheists (who had lived in Rome since... well, since before Rome was even Rome, and that happened around 740 BCE, plus or minus 20 years).   If you need quotes and citations, I would gladly be so accomodating. I hate to see other /r/religion users be unwillfully misinformed.  Edit: I also suggest looking into the Wikipedia article on forced conversion as it lists the major culprits of forced religious conversions with related events, such as devÅirme and how the Samaritans were forced to convert or leave their homes by Muslim leaders in 1021."

religion,3ded56,fight_collector,2,Wed Jul 15 23:53:31 2015 UTC,"Plato demonstrates in the Euthyphro that morality cannot be placed in a polytheistic context   The Eythyphro dilemma applies equally to Monotheism and when the Monotheist asserts that their God is all-good, the consequences are more severe.   Also, as others have pointed out, you neglect to take into account not only inter-pantheon diputes, but also intra-pantheon accounts. Not all devotees of Apollo were cool with devotees of Athena, for instance. And many cults were forbidden and persecuted. Jews and Christians were persecuted by polytheistic Romans.   Thanks for this. I'd be interested in reading more about this. Any book suggestions?   I would also suggest you take another look at Islam, and how accommodating it has been toward other faiths until the modern era, when deviants became the most vocal and forceful.   Not entirely true hey? Islam started out as an Anti-Pagan religion and wiped out Arab Paganism almost entirely. It was very tolerant to Jews and Christians as 'Dhimmis' (charging them a tax however), but this did eventually change. Now Islam is openly hostile to almost all other religions."
religion,3dh1t2,oasis948151,1 point,Thu Jul 16 05:22:20 2015 UTC,"That is essentially what intuition is. And intuition is truly quite the phenomena even in something like athletics, or like something in chess.   For instance: a chess master, through intuition, is able to make a ton of difficult and complex chess moves in a matter of seconds, and through built up experience and visual pattern recognition is able to execute these...   In religion, I think, intuition similarly refers to people who, through their life experiences, have gone to feel a certainty in the presence of God or the Holy Spirit, etc. or perhaps woudl refer to the enlightenment and familiarity with dharma that you would get in other religions, etc.   I have never felt that intuition was a major part of my religious views, because ultimately it doesn't constitute any amount of proof. It is a purely internal function that is unpersuasive in discussions."

religion,3d9jky,Beatleman65,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:56:26 2015 UTC,"IMO the Dhamapadda had the best and most unbiased lessons on how to live life.   The Quran was interesting as well, i enjoyed how much they incorporated old testament stories (even Jesus) into it (if i could read Arabic i would have been able to appreciate the literature more), some of the edgier verses id like to be able to understand in their original tongue for clarification purposes. (e.g. Surah 9, Verse 5).  The old testament was interesting to read as aspects of the stories and book repeat themselves a lot in the western world so the stories i was reading i was already partially familiar with.   However when you consider bible telling you to cast infants against stones, burn witches and make women and slaves submit to you and then the Quran telling you to ambush and slay the unbeliever, stone women for doing the same shit their husbands do, the eye for an eye sense of justice, not to mention the idea of the Caliphate; i think its just best to take any scripture with a dumptruck full of salt.  there are lots of story books that tell you stealing and killing are bad and that virtue and charity and good, while also leaving out all the psychotic dark-age tyranny. Try reading Harry Potter, lots of magic in their too.    Read the scripture of a religion to see the biases, contradictions, and reasoning behind that religion and to be better versed in its working for conversational or debating purposes, not to try and adopt or admire it. Religion is interesting and worth studying but so is the Holocaust, both killed millions (religion=billions) of people, and cause unnecessary hardship for the victims of their implications and overall would have been better off never existing in the first place. at least the Holocaust gave us Antibiotics...

It ultimately serves a fallacious narrative that somehow religion ultimately leads to death and destruction, while actual human history does not bear that conclusion out.  This is also all without touching on the fact that the druids in question in this article are more than likely just Gaulish in origin, since there is no record of the Romans interacting much with Irish or the theoretical Caledonian versions, and instead opts to act as if these actions were universal throughout all Insular Celt and Gaulish culture, which is not a statement that can be made with any academic veracity.

religion,3d8et1,iRTK,2,Wed Jul 15 21:24:17 2015 UTC,"Let me start by saying that the bible says what it says and anyone that expands on what it says is simply offering their own interpretation.  The bible is its own best cross-reference as a lot of the terms that are used symbolically are actually defined in other places in the bible.  It's important to do thorough research on all the places each term is mentioned and examine the context to truly understand what is being described.  That said, here is my personal interpretation:  Leviathan: described in the book of Job, considered by many to be the earliest written book of the bible. 20 Smoke pours from his nostrils as from a boiling pot over a fire of reeds. 21 His breath sets coals ablaze, and flames dart from his mouth. 22 Strength resides in his neck; dismay goes before him. 23 The folds of his flesh are tightly joined; they are firm and immovable. 24 His chest is hard as rock, hard as a lower millstone.  I don't know of any sea creatures that breathes fire, so I can honestly say I don't know what this is.  Probably some species that isn't around anymore.  You didn't mention Behemoth, but he is a land-based creature of immense size and power also mentioned in Job whose description doesn't really fit any of our modern creatures.  Cherub: Cherubim, plural, are a class of angels.  The earliest mention of Cherubim are the two angels with flaming swords that block the entrance to the garden of Eden after Adam and Eve were expelled from it.  Dragon: Often used symbolically to refer to Satan.  Dragons aren't around today, obviously, but isn't it interesting how in many different parts of the world their mythologies contain mentions of dragons?  They're still a big part of Chinese culture today, and there's the dragon in the Old English poem Beowulf.  Many cultures across Asia and Europe have tales of various types of dragons.  This could be evidence that at some point these creatures actually existed, or they're simply embellished tales passed from generation to generation.  Satyr: The hebrew word means ""hairy one"", usually referring to goats which were sometimes used in sacrifices.  Unicorn: The Hebrew word used was re'em, which referred to a wild ox.  Most likely a one-horned ox species that isn't around anymore, not a pretty pony galloping on rainbows.  Unfortunately.  Giant: A man of larger than average height.  Modern translations seem to put Goliath between 6'9"" and 9'9"", which isn't all the surprising considering there's a guy alive right now that's 8'3""  Angel: Translated as ""messenger"".  These were beings understood to have been sent by God to deliver messages or conduct various business in the human world.  There are several different ""types"" described, with differing physical characteristics (2 wings up to 6 wings) and responsibilities.  From the Bible we can determine there is a hierarchy of angels.  Demon: Also angels, however these are specifically referring to the angels that participated in the rebellion against God along with Lucifer (meaning the Light Bringer) who is now commonly known as Satan (the Accuser, the Adversary).  These former angels don't necessarily appear as evil creatures, as Satan himself is described as appearing as an Angel of Light.  Talking Snake: The more accurate word is serpent, which isn't necessarily your garden-variety snake.  In the garden of Eden a snake spoke to Eve and convinced her to eat of the forbidden fruit, but this is commonly believed to have been Satan.  I'm not saying Satan was a serpent, more likely he was in control of or speaking through the serpent.  We know that as a result of disobeying God both Man and Woman were cursed with specific curses.  The serpent was as well, noting that it would now crawl on its belly and eat dust for the rest of its days.  This seems to indicate at one point it did not crawl on its belly, no one can say what it was before other than that.  7-Headed Beast: Described in Revelation as a 7 headed beast with 10 horns.  This is one that is definitely symbolic as the bible defines it as such.  Daniel 7 speaks of a 4 headed beast that would come and in verse 17 it states âThe four great beasts are four kings that will rise from the earth"".  Many modern Christians interpret that to refer to 4 major empires that ruled over the land of Israel shortly after the vision was given to Daniel, those being the Babylonian, Medo-Persian, Greek, and Roman empires.  Witch: Anyone who practiced what we would refer to as occultist practices.  The bible indicates that Satan and his angels actively participate in the affairs of man and attempt to steer him away from the teachings of the Bible, which bring happiness, peace, and prosperity to those who follow them.  The ways of Satan bring death, suffering, and misery.  Non-believers do not have the protection or guidance of the holy spirit therefore they are more susceptible to demonic suggestion.  Demons are capable of a limited degree of supernatural actions, and the Bible indicates that those who practice witchcraft and other occultist practices are actually conferring with and giving power to demons."

It was Jewish writings and theology that gave rise to ""Satan"", the very name being an archaic Hebrew term for ""adversary"".  You ""worship"" something from the same source material that you denigrate. Your belief is no more or no less radical and no more or no less logical than anything else from the Judeo-Christian tradition. And it's equally as hilarious!

God is transcendent above a single description.  Several definitions may all be valid. I can share the Baha'i view which is similar to that of Abrahamic religions - but doesn't view God as a person, entity or physical thing.  An easy but woefully incomplete definition might be: God is that what created the universe, has existed forever, and will continue to last forever.  God is transcendent above being labeled as a ""being"", ""entity"", ""essence"", or ""individual"" and is beyond our ability to describe.  God is all-knowing, all-loving, all-glorious, and manifests the highest form of all virtues.  God is omnipresent (perhaps similar to the pantheistic view).  God is the source of the Prophets (Moses, Christ, Mohammad, Guatama Buddha, Krishna, the Bab, Baha'u'llah, others), and the primary way we know of him."

religion,3d1yny,GeekYogurt,2,Mon Jul 13 05:30:20 2015 UTC,"I posted this in another sub, and I think it's relevant to your question. I'd love to hear this sub's thoughts:  I think the question of whether or not God exists is not a particularly helpful or interesting question. It's much more helpful for us to consider what we might mean when we use the word God.  When I talk about God, I'm talking about that from which, through which, and for which are all things. I'm talking about the reason, the purpose, the principle that animates everything. This God isn't a being, God is the ground of being.  By this definition, we can objectively say that this God is real. This God is not far from the God of Einstein of Spinoza, though it's not necessarily the same. We see this God in the sum of all the processes that govern all things; the incredibly complex and marvelous processes through which new things are always emerging. God is the word we give to what ""grounds"" the ongoing creativity in a universe that is always being created. This God is not a scientific hypothesis. It's not meant to fill in the gaps to explain what we don't yet know about how existence works. Instead speaking of this God is to gaze at the eternally, utterly incomprehensible totality of how existence works and wonder why it all exists in the first place.  That's not to say we know something about why it all exists. God is a mystery. We can't objectively say anything about the will of God. That is, we can't say anything about the principles or purposes or reasons behind the existence of all things. For all we know, God may completely unconcerned with anything at all. Even so, the question isn't so much whether or not 'God' by this definition exists. The question is whether or not we think it's helpful or productive to use the word 'God' to describe this reality.  I believe that it is. For one thing, in regards to our own existence, the ongoing-creativity and processes of emergence can at least be regarded as serendipitous. When we speak of God, then, we speak not only of awe and wonder and mystery and the grandeur of all things, but we also speak from a posture of humility and gratitude. By using God-talk we acknowledge that we're not the master of our own existence. We didn't make this world and we didn't make ourselves. We owe our very being to a convergence of realities completely beyond our comprehension and control.  I believe, then, that even if we don't mean an all powerful being with a knowable and discernible will, speaking of God can be an incredibly important reminder for humanity. At the very least, it acknowledges that our lives are a gift. We have been freely given the gift of existence, not of our own doing. But what's more it also acknowledges that existence itself is not all about 'me.' It's about something much greater than 'me.' Using the language of God to describe this reality, then, can summon us to see our lives as an opportunity to serve rather than to be served.  The idea that the world is not all about 'you' might seem like something obvious. But it's really not, and we certainly seem to spend lots of time acting like it is. We're born into the world as selfish babies and only learn not to be selfish through socialization, and what's more, even after we've leaned empathy, every experience you ever have still places you directly at the center of that experience. You live your entire life as the main character of your own movie. David Foster Wallace goes on about this in ""This is Water."" It's our 'default setting' to go around assuming that existence is all about us, and the only way to over come it is to intentionally choose to remind yourself it's not.  I find this to be the compelling reason to to use the language of God in making sense of our existence and in spiritual practice, searching for some kind of peace. As Kierkegaard put it, prayer is about changing the one who is praying. It's not about magically trying to manipulate and bend reality to your will. Prayer and God-talk is the intentional practice of reminding ourselves (and one another) of something we all need to be reminded of--- that it's not all about us--- that ultimately summons us to see our lives as an opportunity to for service.  Through it, we find us a real sense of purpose in life that can make us more generous, more prudent, more compassionate and caring, less self-indulgent, and less prideful, not because there's something in it for us, but because it's a responsibility we take on out of gratitude. It's also humbling. Even in our deepest devotion to God and one another we all inevitably slip back into our default setting and end up hurting one another and ourselves, and being able to be honest and recognize this about ourselves calls us to be a little bit less judgmental of one another, convicts us to seek forgiveness from those we've wronged, and compels us to be a bit more forgiving of those who've wronged us. It's through humility, then, that you find reconciliation and authentic community with one another.  I don't think you need the idea of God to be good, but I do think the idea of God can help us good, and I don't think we should assume we'll be good without finding some way of intentionally thinking about spiritual questions with others."

Irreligious people is a very diverse group, and I try to remember that. I have always been drawn to the big questions and I find rituals fascinating and useful. These led me to seek out a community of folks who shared these traits. No. I think it's important that my religion be visible enough that others who would benefit from finding it can in fact find it (find us), but it isn't for everyone and it fits no good to artificially try to push the membership numbers. That is complicated. My religion influences who I spend time with â a few times each week I spend time with others of my religion, which was a large part of my interest in being religious. Also, my religion reminds me to act and affiliate in accordance with my values, so it sometimes has pushed me to stop pursuing certain friendships or to try extra hard to nurture other friendships. I don't think prayer is necessary. This has no place within my own religion, and I can't speak about other religions. It's always a struggle. I don't believe in a personified god. Dying for love or to protect community or to not violate one's values is noble, though. We mostly get ignored or told that we're not a religion.

religion,3cztkz,EmeraldRange,2,Sun Jul 12 19:11:34 2015 UTC,"1)  No. Some people I meet are actually surprised I am religious, because I'm rather nerdy (in the ""logic"" sense).  2) I don't really have any strong opinions about them. I am kind of surrounded by them socially, so I've gotten to know them quite well that I know they have diverse non-theistic beliefs.  3)My parents were religious and when I read my respective religious text (which they had not), I spent quite a bit of my teenage years arguing with them about religion with them. Although I don't do that anymore, I've become quite religious because of all that.  4)I'm happy when I see people who follow  or convert to my religion, but I don't try to active do any proselytising. I like respect others beliefs in the same way I want them to respect mines.  5)The particular variation/denomination of my religion that I follow doesn't really believe in religious institutions for common laypeople (I.e. Not monks). So the influence it has on my social life is hard to see. However, I'm sure it is there because I avoid violence a little too much.  6)I believe praying is a form of distraction (as Sigmond Freud would put it) and that it can only make you believe it's real by manipulating your psychology. I do not mean any offence to people who believe it works, I am simply stating my reasoning for not praying.  7) A certain way to look at Buddhism is that really everything that is proclaimed ""good"" is just to stop your suffering and prevent you from achieving a worse state of existence in Samsara. Therefore, I choose to see such people to be doing the right things, but without the right mind. I think they can escape the punishment they dread, but won't get into the good side of their religion either.  8)In some sense, yes and in some other sense, no. There are certainly times when I want to condemn other denominations of my religion, but I've rarely condemned my own denomination. I do openly criticise extremists, but I don't really believe they are doing it because of religion.  9)I would not die for my ""God"" because the stance on divinity in my denomination of Buddhism is vague at best. This vague stance on the existence of a Supreme Being has created quite a few followers who are theistic, quite a few followers who are atheistic and many followers that are agnostic. I don't know how to classify myself personally because although I feel there is a grander plan to civilisation than just people going through mundane jobs and then dying, but I also refuse to believe in an omniscient, omnipotent and omnibenevelent being. Therefore, I would not die for this ""God"" that some people believe and others don't, simply because belief in a ""God"" is irrelevant to my beliefs. I would probably die to help others or the community in general if given enough time to think, but I wouldn't die for religious fervour.  10) I've rarely had stark criticism of my particular denomination, but I often try to explain things to critics of my religion in general: sometimes having to result to ""That's not part of my denomination so I can't really explain that""."

religion,3cztkz,roja1559,1 point,Sun Jul 12 18:27:39 2015 UTC,"Not sure if you're still looking for answers, but here anyway.   * 1. Yes, I wear a crucifix necklace. I don't wear it as much to show my faith to others, but rather to affirm my faith to myself.   * 2. I think that non-religious people have a right to believe or not believe whatever they want. One thing that rubs me the wrong way, though, is when atheists try to talk me out of my faith. In my opinion, Christians aren't allowed to force their religion onto others, but others are not allowed to force their non-religion onto me.   * 3. This is an extraordinarily difficult question for me, but I will do my best to provide a coherent explanation. I have always been a deep thinker, drawn to questions that go beyond my understanding of the world. I grew up in a church-going family but I always sat in the back and did my homework instead of listening to the sermons. One day, when I finally began to listen and understand some of what the pastor was saying, it was like a new light was shed onto these questions: where will my mind go when I die, for example, was answered with to God, in Heaven. Church became a place of quiet reflection for me, rather than a weekly nuisance. Also, due to the amazing, caring people and community of the church, it is also a place of companionship for me. Now, with my faith, I can't believe that I spent the majority of my childhood in skepticism of what is now the pillar of my life.   * 4. No. I think that religion is something that each person must find for themselves. A religion built on the promises or words of another, friend, family member, pastor, or otherwise, is not as powerful in any sense as a religion that one discovers- a God that he/she sees with his/her own two eyes. If religion is spread through anything other than actions that embody Christ, it is spread falsely. Also, I don't believe that anyone should be pressed into something that he/she doesn't wholeheartedly understand and believe in.   * 5. Not much, however I do tend to seek out people who act as I strive to act- caring, kind, compassionate, giving, and honest. To me, these are qualities of Jesus and though I can't pretend that I am as he was, I try my hardest every day to imitate his actions.   * 6. Praying is something that changes from person to person. When I pray, I don't bow my head and utter words to God and Christ. I instead reflect on what the Lord and my faith means to me and what I can do to better myself. I bare the insides of my mind to myself, and through my faith, I trust that He is with me and He sees my struggle. Literally, I don't bow my head; I have never bowed my head or folded my hands, instead I tend to look upward. In church it is the stained-glass window of Jesus that I look to when I pray. I believe that praying is the truest and purest way of communicating with God, so yes, in my opinion it is necessary to having a relationship with Him.   * 7. Everyone has a different reason to turn to Christ. It isn't my place to question them or pass judgement on anyone save myself. However, I do believe that no matter the reason, God gives comfort to us all and turning to Him is the first step towards the embodiment of Christ.   * 8. Never. My faith is never at fault. If there is a fault to find, it is with me, because I am human and only humans err- never God. That being said, there are certain aspects of Christianity that I believe have become rotten, like people who hate on gay marriage and evolution and things like that. However, as I said, the error rests with the humans and not with the faith. I would never turn my back on God; I might, if it came to it, turn my back on the human expression of Him.   * 9. If He called me to die for Him, I would without a second thought. God wouldn't take my life without a reason. It's not my place to decide my fate, it's His, and so if He decided to forgive me of my sins and take me to Heaven I wouldn't fight it. But there aren't many situations that I can come up with where I would make the decision myself to die for Him (unless, as I said, He communicated to me in some way that it was my time).   * 10. Like I said above, I refuse to press my faith onto others and in return I expect that they don't insult my faith. But honestly, most of the criticism towards my religion is aimed at the radicals, and as I am not one, I manage to avoid most of the confrontations. The worst abuse I've ever gotten was from a friend of mine who was viciously anti-Christian; but after discussing it for hours on end, we managed to come to an agreement. After that, all I got was the occasional ""because she loves Jesus"" from that end of the spectrum.   Sorry for the huge wall of text. I hope this helps, and good luck on your project!"

What speculation there is varies wildly--most Christians don't even believe in the rapture.  Not believing in the Rapture myself, I can't answer your Mars question.  One thing I've wondered is if the ""sky raining fire"" is a reference to the sun going supernova, in which case Mars would be consumed alongside the Earth.  But of course that does not really answer your question--what if someone is outside the field of Christ's second coming when it happens?

In any  case, though, even in the Bible, very little is said of the end times, and what there is is very clearly allegorical.

I've read a fair amount about the religion, although I've done no formal study. Hopefully I can be more help than the others you've spoken to.   It really depends on the tradition, as that determines what a ""Hindu"" is. Those who say you can't, however, are probably ignorant of history. People certainly have converted in the past, the most famous being Heliodorus and George Harrison. The groups who say you can't most often believe that Hindu status is given by one's birth, or by one's birth and whether one lives in India. With respect, I believe that these people are misguided right-wingers with an incomplete understanding of history, who do their faith a disservice by claiming that something as paltry as race or birth should have any bearing on the soul's ability to attain jivanmukti. The same way most religions propagate themselves: raising children and cultural assimilation. For the former, parents pass the practices of their religion on to their children, sometimes represented by rite-of-passage ceremonies and objects such as the sacred thread. For the latter, Hindus brought their religious practices with them as they spread through Southeast Asia, where they supplemented or supplanted the local beliefs. Yes, this is very true. Some deities occupy central roles in certain regions, but are totally absent in others, and practices and beliefs vary wildly between regions and schools. In fact, there are no practices or beliefs that all Hindus share. Fortunately for you, this means that some groups would be all too willing to take you in, if you'd have them. I'm not sure. I'm not sure you would be Hindu. You have to remember that the idea that one's religious identification is determined principally by one's statement of belief is  uniquely Western, and anomalous as a result. In my understanding, whether or not one can claim to be a Hindu has less to do with what one believes and more to do with what one does. The scriptures don't say ""Believe this to be saved"", but rather ""Do this to be saved"". If you really want to be Hindu, find a teacher and learn how to meditate, sacrifice, and love God.   If you haven't already, I would highly recommend picking up a copy of the Bhagavad Gita and reading it, as it's considered by many to be a good overview of what Hinduism is and what one needs to do to be saved. You can get one from your local ISKCON branch (although it will be heavily commented upon with the beliefs of their tradition, which are somewhat unusual), and you can also read it online through links in the /r/Hinduism sidebar (a community that I recommend you investigate). I hope these words from a random stranger were helpful."

However,  I accidentally came across, Autobiography of a Yogi.  I pick it up because I'm looking for references to dreams and dreaming across all religions. It reads sort of like Gulliver's Travels meets philosophy of love. I've hardly been able to put it down.

It's not sanskrit meaning the word is from somewhere else.

So think of North American Aboriginal groups, they can be similar, but they all have distinct tribal beliefs and spiritualities. But we like to link them all as one and title it ""Aboriginal Spirituality"" or something of the sort. I think that's what's going on when we speak on Hinduism and India.

Gay marriage/equality doesn't inhibit ones religious freedoms because the person who takes offense isn't being forced to perform sexual acts with members of the same sex. In other words, nobody except the voluntary participants are sinning. The equality that the video speaks of? It extends to everyone. If you wish to run a business you must be willing to serve everyone. Don't like it? Don't run a business that caters to the public. The equality and freedom deserved as a human being trumps religious freedom. Oddly enough, it's this very idea (a human being deserving equality and freedom) that leads to, and allows for, the idea of religious freedom.    Removing religious symbolism from government buildings is, again, an issue of equality. How would you feel if a verse from the Qur'an were plastered on every government building? You probably wouldn't like it. What about Hindu? Again, you probably wouldn't like it.

There's the classic one that broke the Free Exercise Clause and kicked off RFRA legislation in the first placeâNative Americans who are forbidden from using peyote as dictated by their religion. You can argue that lots of other examples constitute, at the most, certain religious perspectives being burdened (ie: either compromise your sincerely held religious beliefs or shut down your livelihood and find a new career), but I don't think that you can get more unambiguous than ""the sacrament you use for your religious rites is illegal.""   edit: To be fair, it's probably worth emphasizing that post-Smith many jurisdictions in the United States have carved out some degree of exemptions for Native American use of peyote, and RFRA legislation has largely done what it was supposed to do and offered protection in other jurisdictions. See, for example, Gonzales v. O Centro Espirita Beneficente Uniao do Vegetal. RFRA protections, however, have not been implemented throughout the entire country, and now that they've been construed as anti-gay bigotry states that have attempted to introduce them have faced a lot more difficulty in doing so, leaving plenty of jurisdictions in the United States where religions that involve hallucinogenic sacraments are effectively illegal to practice."

I'm not quite sure what you mean by ""demonstrate the most fundamental religious views while voting,"" but I don't think that this is quite what I meant.  States with RFRAs have stronger religious freedom protections than states without them1. Some states with RFRAs (or similar amendments to their state constitutions) have a relatively large and politically influential religious culture that you might call fundamentalist (Alabama, Texas, Missouri, etc.), while some states that have RFRA legislation don't (Rhode Island, Connecticut).   The big dividing line isn't so much how religious or not-religious a state is, but how recently they got on the RFRA train. Two decades ago RFRA was completely uncontroversial and supported by liberals and conservatives alike. The Smith decision clearly and substantially reduced the religious freedom offered by the First Amendment, and people were on board with reversing that via statute. Today, however, it's assumed that RFRAs just exist to let bigoted Christians avoid anti-discrimination laws when it comes to gay people (sometimes for good reason, sometimes not), and so there's a lot more controversy when states try to pass them.    1 That's not to say that states with RFRAs don't inhibit religious freedoms, too, though. Even just looking at sacramental use of controlled drugs, RFRAs don't provide complete or universal protection; just the groundwork for specific exemptions in specific circumstances."

This idea is clearly bullshit, so perhaps I misunderstand what you are saying.  I am making no allegations regarding other's amount of faith, but just because they use the name Christian doesn't mean they understand what they read the same way I do.  Lets take a look at what the Bible says about the fate of mankind.  If you read Revelation carefully, you will see that Hell and Death are emptied of all souls for the day of judgement before they are cast into the lake of fire. The verses speaking of hell are almost all conditional, and meant as a warning. But I think the scriptures are pretty clear that no-one will end up there.  I believe we are all created to be reconciled to each other and God, and that our future existence will be filled with joy.  The Gospel is announced with the Angel's words in Luke 2:10 -   But the angel said to them, âDo not be afraid. I bring you good news that will cause great joy for all the people.   I don't know how some people argue that spending an eternity in hell is consistent with those words.  The scriptures tell us three times with almost the same words:  -Isaiah 45-23, Romans 14:11, and Philippians 2:10:   By myself I have sworn, my mouth has uttered in all integrity a word that will not be revoked: Before me every knee will bow; by me every tongue will swear.   We will all join together in worshiping Him!  Psalm 103 tells us that God's anger towards us because of our sin will not be eternal:   8 The Lord is merciful and loving, slow to become angry and full of constant love. 9 He does not keep on rebuking; he is not angry forever.  10 He does not punish us as we deserve or repay us according to our sins and wrongs.   Many places in scripture tell us that all will eventually partake of God's gift of Grace. I will share some more of them:  Colossians 1:15-20 is a powerful statement that Jesus' will for all creation will come to pass:   15 The Son is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn over all creation. 16 For in him all things were created: things in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or powers or rulers or authorities; all things have been created through him and for him. 17 He is before all things, and in him all things hold together. 18 And he is the head of the body, the church; he is the beginning and the firstborn from among the dead, so that in everything he might have the supremacy. 19 For God was pleased to have all his fullness dwell in him, 20 and through him to reconcile to himself all things, whether things on earth or things in heaven, by making peace through his blood, shed on the cross.   We haven't exhausted the scriptures that tell us all are saved in Christ.  Romans 11:32:   ""For God has bound all men over to disobedience so that he may have mercy on them all.""   1 Corinthians 15:22:   ""For as in Adam all die, so also in Christ shall all be made alive.""   1 John 2:2:   He is the atoning sacrifice for our sins, and not only for ours but also for the sins of the whole world."" ""The Lord is not slow in keeping his promise, as some understand slowness. He is patient with you, not wanting anyone to perish, but everyone to come to repentance."" That is why we labor and strive, because we have put our hope in the living God, who is the Savior of all people, and especially of those who believe.   Jesus told the story of the Prodigal Son in part to warn us that some of us would not be happy when we see the wayward welcomed back. Several other parables, such as the parable of the workers in the vineyard also touch on this.  John 12:47   47 And if any man hear my words, and believe not, I judge him not: for I came not to judge the world, but to save the world.   Does this mean we can ignore the consequence of harmful behavior? Of course not! Each of us still have the gift of agency.  But my wish is that you can take some of the same hope in these verses that I do that in the end, we are all His Sheep.  The good news of the Gospel I believe in is not condemnation of anyone. It is truly good news for all."

There is a reason why God chose the Man to be spiritual leaders. A Godly man is level-headed and wise. Women and men are created differently, we think differently, we deal with emotions differently, and our brains are different anatomically. Women are great leaders as educators, raising families, and helping/respecting/encouraging men. There is a reason why a good and God-fearing man thinks and acts level-headedly in contrast to how women can sometimes react emotionally. The brave and virtuous man is not afraid to stand firm to a cause-this is why men are good at being soldiers.

In an as-of-yet untranslated tablet on exegesis, he said that outside of ""law"" verses (which we have an elected body to maintain) anything can be interpreted in anyway so long as we don't push it on each other or others. So, for example, some former Mormons rely on the Book of Mormon for inspiration even though that is definitely not Baha'i canon; while Native Americans bring in tribe-specific dances or ceremonies an adapt them to the Faith; etc. Otherwise, yes, we'd hold our concepts of ""Progressive Revelation"" and the ""Covenant"" (both lesser and Greater) to be absolutely true."

Either he is saying that he isn't subject to his own claims (which makes his claim a lie) or his claims have equally no authority (which makes them pointless)?

There's a quote that should a Manifestation declare water to be wine (even though it would still be water), we'd have to accept that it was wine.   Everyone except the Manifestation, to Baha'is, is limited and thus cannot access authoritative interpretations.  However, that does mean ""how do we know what is an authoritative interpretation of the authoritative interpreter"" -- and that's where I think productive discussion can occur, because outside of legal verses which we have a body to proclaim, no one really knows.

religion,3cf3hv,InspiredRichard,1 point,Sun Jul 12 22:50:50 2015 UTC,"Well, for one, it's a matter of authority - the statement is meant that we'd be obedient (If we choose to have faith -- we very much oppose forcing religion on others) to the utmost extent if we believe.  Moreover, it's called the sociology of knowledge/social construction of reality. It's a formal discipline in most graduate institutions of sociology (usually within ""sociology of culture""). Nearly everything we think of as a ""fact"" is mirrored through language and in other ways is socially constructed. So there isn't anything that is ""objectively true"" except the physical/environmental world; and even then, the way we discuss those things is ""socially constructed"" and not true (I.e., Judith Butler provides a feminist analysis of how problematic high school/intro biology textbooks divide the cell and label it, because it presupposes a male/female operation).

religion,3cf3hv,InspiredRichard,2,Wed Jul 8 03:05:02 2015 UTC,"Good question.  An important point: the BahÃ¡'Ã­ Faith doesn't say all aspects of other religions are true.  Some religions are just totally made up, for example.  What BahÃ¡'Ã­s believe is that Prophets (or ""Manifestations of God"") such as Moses, Christ, Mohammad and BahÃ¡'u'llÃ¡h (for example) have created the major world religions today; that all of these Prophets are one with God, and that they each carry a message from God for their time and place.  This is what we believe is fundamental to religion and unites us all.  Of course, people have interpreted and changed the message of these Prophets over time.  Consider how many branches of Islam and Christianity there are for example; obviously not all of them are correct in everything they say (not that we're perfect either).  We don't go as far as to say what words of Christ are authentic or not, or to try to evaluate what parts of other religions are true.  (Although, there are many references to the Bible and Quran in the writings of BahÃ¡'u'llÃ¡h, which presumably suggests authenticity of the particular reference).  There's a lot more to be explained of course, this is really just the surface.  The key takeaway is that it's very nuanced; the BahÃ¡'Ã­ Faith believes in an absolute truth that we gradually learn about.  It's not like we take anything we want and call it true."

religion,3civ0n,VerseBot,2,Wed Jul 8 16:22:51 2015 UTC,"C.S. Lewis: ""A man who was merely a man and said the sort of things Jesus said would not be a great moral teacher. He would either be a lunatic â on the level with the man who says he is a poached egg â or else he would be the Devil of Hell. You must make your choice. Either this man was, and is, the Son of God, or else a madman or something worse. You can shut him up for a fool, you can spit at him and kill him as a demon or you can fall at his feet and call him Lord and God, but let us not come with any patronizing nonsense about his being a great human teacher. He has not left that open to us. He did not intend to.""  I don't necessarily agree with Lewis here, but the point is this. Jesus told his disciples to leave everything and everyone, he told a rich man to give all of his money to the poor to enter the kingdom of heaven, and he whipped and drove out money changers at a Jewish temple.  Could he be a moral person and say/do these things? Or would he have to be divine for these things to make sense?  I recommend you reading Mere Christianity on this subject and then search for commentary both positive and negative."

Image what that looked like if you walked into that type of activity.  There were people buying and selling favors from God by way of trinkets, animals for slaughter (doves, goats etc) and even saying they were selling holy relics to give a person the edge over another for favor with God.  How would you feel if you walked into that 'market' mess?  Is it not contradictory of the word of God and does it not reflect the greed of man?  Wouldn't you get angry and turn over tables if you wittnessed this if you carried a passion for your belief system?  Another idea many people may have over looked is the vilness of keeping animals in cages during these exchanges.  There would be urine and feces on the floor, people yelling above others to make these exchanges, hay that was moldy, the whole place would have been a stench similiar to a stable.  And remember this was the most important building (a temple) in the entire region, a place to commune with God.  Why Wouldn't Jesus get upset?"

religion,3civ0n,EbonShadow,1 point,Wed Jul 8 15:47:41 2015 UTC,"It was only a few days ago that my grand daughter wrote on Facebook (she is twelve) a rant about people assuming that all Christens were homophonic.   In her posts she said people were talking to the wrong Christens.  Hers was a simple little posts but nicely bringing up the issues of bigotry and she was unaware she opened up that can of worms.  It didn't take long before someone (two adults) began to say she was wrong and began quoting Bible verses to prove their views about the vileness of homosexually. These people were her freinds as they were her youth ministry leaders.  I was completely appalled at their attacks.  I wrote a general statement that praised her observations as I too was Christian and firmly believe God is made of love and does not look down on any union that is bathed in love, respect and honors these unions.  I expressed it was the self sexual explorations that leave one or both feeling bad that God discourages as those relationships are not wholesome nor considered harmless as they end up hurting another.  The guy who wrote earlier said my argument was unfounded as I did not quote any Bible verses to back it up.  I was dumbfounded.  What happened to the teachings of Jesus within the New Testament?  I thought Christans built their entire religious beliefs on Jesus's ministry?  What happened to ""love thee neighbor"", ""forgive your enemy"", and ""Ye who is without sin, throw the first stone?""  It finally hit me that there is alot of Christans that cherry pick  Bible verses to support their way of thoughts.  They will twist around the doctrine of the Bible to suit their personal beliefs.  I see some of them worried about death even though they say they believe in a heaven or after life but then I find out they really don't.  I watch how they throw out the doctrine of Jesus and cling to the Old Testament and still call themselves Christians.  At least this is what I witnessed the other day from two people.  I felt angry but then felt terribly sad.  What those two people accomplished was destroy a kind young voice just beginning to form oponions.  I taught her the word of God was love and if she understood the messages of Jesus and applied his principals in her life, she would be the best person she could be.  Those two undid what I was teaching her.  What a shame!    I haven't talked to her yet and do not know how she is affected but no one has the right to shame someone because their views are different.  I think I just went off topic and I am sorry.  I guess I was trying to say that the lessons Jesus stood for is becoming less than it should within the Christans community.   When he teaches the important of forgiveness, many are being judgemental and showing bigotry towards others.  I don't get it.  Edit.  Ok I guess I am being judgemental as well.  I should not let anger rule but it becomes fustrasting."
religion,3civ0n,lisabauer58,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:51:47 2015 UTC,"I see Jesus as a man who spoke of heaven and not of issues of the earth (physical world).  The only time he said he was the son of God was when he said he is the son of God as we too are the sons and daughters of God.  He did not place himself above anyone else.  The people did that.  He talked of humility, placing someone elses needs above our own.  He did not intend that anyone should worship him as a God but intended people to believe in what he teaches so that they may enter into heaven.    In my belief, if any man or woman choses to follow in the path of Jesus's message then they will be entering into a higher level of heaven than if that person spent their life placing themselfs over others.  These people do not even have to hang a sign on themselves and call themselves Christans.  They only need to live the life Jesus asks us to. Jesus as speaking of our lives after we leave this one.  He was explaining how our envirnoment in heaven is influrenced by our behavior and thoughts here.  And our 'here' is but a few minutes in comparison to the lenghth of time in eternity.   What Jesus said was exactly what he meant."

On top of that no law should ever be on the books that restricts what people do based on the moral assumptions of one specific religion.  I often see people referencing the Constitution during these debates and I find that they've glossed over the 1st Amendment to make their point. Marriage is not a right but it certainly is freedom of speech and under the law it's simply a business contract between two people.

religion,3cfdds,Destielfan,3,Wed Jul 8 03:37:27 2015 UTC,You missed in your history class that homosexual prosecution was started by Christians/Jews/Muslims. It was a part of every other historical culture that came before them. Religious extremism gone amuck.  Your bigotry has absolutely no place in a biology discussion. Sexual preference is at the very least part genetic. Religious extremism gone amuck.  Referencing past crimes in common law doesn't excuse bigotry or criminality. At one point common law forbade interracial marriage. Was it right then? No. religious extremism gone amuck.

religion,3cfdds,Destielfan,-2,Wed Jul 8 14:00:30 2015 UTC,You haven't handled anything. Biology has nothing to do with sexual preference. Heterosexuality is still the way the bodies were designed to function and the only way you get proecreation of the species. Homosexuality was not widely accepted in the ancient world and you would know this if you read The Bible and Homsoexual practice by Dr. Robert Gagnon. It was a disgrace to be the feminized male in ancient cultures prior to Judaism/Christianity. Lesbianism was particularly frowned upon in ancient societies even in the time of the first century. It was not considered by the pagans of the day to be permissible in the same way they permitted male homosexuality. So you've demonstrated nothing thus far.

religion,3cfdds,Destielfan,-2,Tue Jul 7 23:23:02 2015 UTC,Not really. It is an article not a dissertation. You can find the references to the Constitution with a Google search for the dissenting opinions of Justices Roberts and Scalia. Biology is self-evident as only heterosexuals can reproduce. History is also self-evident as there are no examples of societies that have embraced out-right homosexual marriage. That point has been a bit obscured by pseudo-historians who claim that the medieval church endorsed such marriages but the truth is that it did not. The Catholic church has been consistent in this as were the earliest Christians and the Jews. So I'm well justified in the claims that I make.

religion,3cb59l,Taqwacore,4,Tue Jul 7 07:35:58 2015 UTC,"A few of things wrong with your post, but overall a fairly good effort:   Now next thing is some people think that infidels means dishonest people, untrustworthy, but if you ask anyone who knows Arabic very well even if he wasn't a Muslim, he will tell you that the infidel is the person who doesn't believe in something, and in Islam, it means those people who don't believe in God.   Correct me if I'm wrong, but when the Qur'an talks of ""infidels"", it is specifically referring to the followers of Meccan Paganism, not atheists. There are numerous post-canonical accounts of public debates between famous Islamic scholars of antiquity and atheists, none of which finished with ""and then we killed the infidel/atheist...score than one up to a 'point conceded'"".   But while ""infidel"" might refer to Meccan Paganism, there still seems to have been some limits on this because even after Muhammed became the Caliph and ruled Mecca, there aren't any accounts recorded in the hadiths of him ordering the deaths of all the Meccan Pagans still residing in the city. What exactly happened to them is absent from the histories. But after the Meccan leader Abu Sufyan converted to Islam, is plausible that many other Quraish followed suit.   One last thing, if the Muslims were really behind 9/11, then I think the US should have revenged from the Islamic countries, and not the country that is the most far away from Islam which is Iraq.   Which is why the US attacked Afghanistan, because they were harboring OBL. The war in Iraq came later, supposedly because they thought there were WMDs.   I'm asking you to not believe that those who force people into Islam are Muslims   But they are Muslims, just not very good ones. We can't pronounce takfir (trans. excommunication) over them because they're dicks. When we start calling takfir on a group, be become just like them.  That said, everything that I've not disagreed with, I agree with (if that makes sense)."
religion,3cb59l,Taqwacore,0,Mon Jul 6 17:56:09 2015 UTC,"The reason why the history didn't mention what happened to the infidels in Mecca after the Prophet Mohammed (pbuh) ruled it is that because when he entered there he stood in front of the Kaaba then said to them ""What do you think am I going to do to you?"" they said: ""Good, a generous brother and a generous cousin"" then he said: ""Go you are all free"" and you can search everywhere on this  and they were free to join Islam, leave it, stay in Mecca or leave it as well. And for Afghanistan, the US attacked them at 2001, and that's 10 years before 9/11, and finally, I'm not asking people to call those people as Kuffar I said don't believe them."

religion,3c8j41,zZSleepyZz,4,Sun Jul 5 22:12:52 2015 UTC,"I would personally say that there isn't much of a problem here at all. For one, particularly when your friends are atheists, is it really a Pagan ceremony rather than a ceremony with Pagan origins (something western Christians are intimately familiar with already whether they realise it or not)? Civil marriages in most countries very closely follow the basic arrangement for traditional Christian ceremonies, but we wouldn't usually describe them as such. Clearly the symbolism they mean to invoke here is different if they are not inclined towards religious belief in general. You mention a water spirit, but I would assume that as atheists - at least if you're using the term in the way it's usually used today - that they are seeking the blessing of the spiritual qualities associated with water, rather than any kind of spirit or deity. I personally would say that is perfectly compatible with Christianity - and that in a round-about way, it is God's blessing of those qualities that you as an individual would be seeking to impart. What they think of it, and what language they ask you to use, does not ultimately change that fact. I personally would see it more like giving a blessing in a different language, rather than giving a different kind of blessing - you would merely be conveying God's blessing in a way that they find most pleasing, comfortable and relatable.  And ultimately, I would think that God is much more concerned with whether or not your friends truly and authentically love each other, whether they intend to work together to build a happy union and whether or not you are prepared to support your friend, than about the details of the wedding ceremony. At the end of the day, supporting and helping your friends to live lives full of happiness and love is a very Christian thing to do - and I think you would very much be doing that by participating in the ceremony, even if you aren't completely comfortable with the terms. If you are concerned that other people might misconstrue your own values and beliefs as an individual, then you can always ask your friend if it would be okay to wear a crucifix necklace openly or some such, as a subtle way of emphasising your own beliefs despite the unusual circumstances."
religion,3c8j41,ampason,3,Sun Jul 5 23:43:11 2015 UTC,"This is the best answer from my perspective.  If they want a ceremony of their choosing, that's fine. Many who say they are ""mocking religion"" seem a bit off to me. Who throws a wedding (one they want to be meaningful for their special day) just to mock and alienate the very friends that they wish to celebrate their union with? They want to have a special day for them, not ruin everyone elses. Water is also a deeply Christian symbol, as others have mentioned. Your participation is easily reconciled with the Christian faith. You already celebrate many ""pagan"" holidays with ""pagan"" symbols that were adapted to Christianity anyways. I would say roll with it and support your friends."
religion,3c8j41,kinderspiel,3,Mon Jul 6 02:31:54 2015 UTC,"I agree about this being the best answer.  FWIW, I've done something similar (though reversed).  I'm Pagan, and I was once asked to be involved in a Catholic wedding, and do a reading from the Bible.  It felt a little odd to me, but at the end of the day, it ultimately holds no meaning for me.  It does for them, and it was their day.  Your friends aren't asking you to share their beliefs, just to be involved in something that's important to them.

It's not a way to mock the traditions, they do it because they respect the traditions and want to connect with their ancestors and the ancient pre-Christian world which they associate with more so than they do with the Christian society in which they live.  To them, their ancestry and its European traditions are a part of their identity and the history of their people that they want to keep alive and honour; they just can't seriously believe in those ancient myths as fact. There are plenty of Christians and Muslims across the world that will even incorporate tribal and pagan traditions into their faith as it is a part of their identity. I assume that you follow the Christmas, Easter and Halloween traditions that certainly don't have Christian origin (and if not, you're a minority and plenty of other Christians can work as an example), but have rather mixed culturally to become a secular part of your religious holidays. Those traditions do nothing to affect your devotion to Christ, just as honouring the traditions of Atheists' ancestors plays no role in their own belief system."

Asking an Atheist to read a segment of a Scriptural service is definitely asking them to endorse it too.... At least as something they support also.

In short ... why not let you add your own Scripture too?   You could even take some things from Scripture that include the terms about water (I Peter, II Peter) or living water .. or the like.

Yet there are some situations in which living together becomes practically impossible for a variety of reasons. In such cases the Church permits the physical separation of the couple and their living apart. the spouses do not cease to be husband and wife before God and so are not free to contract a new union. In this difficult situation, the best solution would be, if possible, reconciliation. the Christian community is called to help these persons live out their situation in a Christian manner and in fidelity to their marriage bond which remains indissoluble   In some cases Catholics will get a civil divorce, but that does not mean that the church recognizes the divorce.    Today there are numerous Catholics in many countries who have recourse to civil divorce and contract new civil unions. In fidelity to the words of Jesus Christ - ""Whoever divorces his wife and marries another, commits adultery against her; and if she divorces her husband and marries another, she commits adultery""158 The Church maintains that a new union cannot be recognized as valid, if the first marriage was. If the divorced are remarried civilly, they find themselves in a situation that objectively contravenes God's law. Consequently, they cannot receive Eucharistic communion as long as this situation persists. For the same reason, they cannot exercise certain ecclesial responsibilities. Reconciliation through the sacrament of Penance can be granted only to those who have repented for having violated the sign of the covenant and of fidelity to Christ, and who are committed to living in complete continence.   So I don't think the Pope actually is recognizing divorce here, he just acknowledged that sometimes separation is necessary."

religion,3c3huo,ahoyhoyhey,2,Sat Jul 4 12:09:48 2015 UTC,"No surprise, as entheogens like the divine mushrooms can connect consciousness to the divine. I think this is also the reasons why Christian oppressors in the Americas hated these entheogens so much. It was not acceptable for them that a normal person can come into contact with the divine without going through a mediator (priest), who runs their cash cows (churches). They wanted to keep the monopoly on the divine, and use it for their own egoistic purpose.   Now we have the funny situation that shroom-eating ravers have more spiritual experience than the typical Christian (though often without being aware of it). Because Christians/abrahamic faiths are usually totally cut off from the divine, never making a spiritual experience, no matter how devout they are, only repeating some words from books, while actual connection with the divine is far away from what words can describe.   Basically it's like Christianity is showing them pictures of (fake) food, telling them ""this is the divine"". While spiritual experience means actually connecting with the divine, and eating actual food.  All the words in these books don't bring them closer to the divine, they seperate them even more from it, e.g. by telling them that there is a border between the divine and the universe/humans. They believe it, and never question it. Thus they will never go searching, and discover that the divine is actually a inherent part of them, ""hidden"" deep inside of them, and that the seperation is only an elaborate illusion. Kinda ironic that a religion whichs proclaims to have deeper understanding of the divine made this seperation (creator vs. creation) a doctrine, confusing the elaborate illusion with what actually is.  Through entheogenics this ""hidden"" and inseperable connection between man (and everything else) and divine can become revealed (in some cases). Though in many cases it simply results in more illusions. So people will confuse layers of their personal (un)conscious with the divine, and then start believing ""God hates fags"", while it's only primitive aspects of their own unconscious. Then they write books like the Bible, telling others that their personal unconscious is the personality of God. God needs worship, God wants to control your lifestyle, God gets angry ... as if God had needs and wants, and anger, like the stupid human who wrote the book."

So it can show us an aspect of our nervous system that may be not developed, or imbalanced - ultimately, I think it's within ourselves, but the plants or 'drugs' can point that out.

To one person, ""God"" might be this guy up in the sky that is watching you and making sure you don't ""sin"" and will throw you in hell if you do.  To another person, god is this mystical force that is ever-present and loving.  To another person, god can manifest in many ways in the world... etc.  In terms of the sort of stereotypical view of the ""Christian God"", that of being some human-like entity that somehow created everything and holds the key to our eternal salvation or damnation, that seems almost... childish to me, and naive.

religion,3c3huo,CuntSmellersLLP,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:05:30 2015 UTC,"You have a good response, and seem to be pretty well thought out on this topic.  I tend to agree, that the ""jealous, very human-like god"" idea is kind of silly.  I personally, if I were to say my closest affiliation, would sort of say that I'm Buddhist leaning.  In Buddhism, the idea isn't that there's some external being that is deciding our fate, but rather that if you can realize the true nature of things that you become free (sort of).  In Buddhism, sometimes there are teachings on what a Buddha really is - it is said that there are 3 ""bodies"" or ""states"" of a Buddha - the Dharmakaya, or Truth State, the Sambhogakaya, or ""Bliss State"", and the Nirmanakaya, or ""Manifestation State"".  When it comes to the Truth State, that is basically described as the beyond concepts, beyond form, true nature of things - beyond description.  In the zen saying ""the finger pointing towards the moon"", it would be the moon.  It is said sometimes that through devotion to the Dharmakaya, one can develop certain capacities and qualities.  But in Buddhism, it is taught/understood that fundamentally there is no actual separation between the nature of our mind and the Dharmakaya.  I think in a mystical/non-sectarian view of religion, what could be called ""God"" is potentially interchangeable with the ""Truth State"".  Again, the understanding in Buddhism, however, being that ultimately this state is the nature of our mind.  On a smaller, sectarian/intellectual point of view, of course, this falls apart as people sometimes develop some pretty elaborate ideas.  And of course, there are methods within Buddhism (and other traditions) that allow one to actually experience this oneself.  Anyway, just some thoughts."
religion,3c3huo,TaylorS1986,0,Tue Jul 7 20:12:17 2015 UTC,"Yes.  The hardest part to these types of awakenings in my personal experiences is trying to explain ""the knowing"". and how deep that knowing goes.  Its not supported by tangible items, views, or proof but, instead, the experience goes so much deeper than needing explanations.  When this knowing occured, it taught me to accept those things I could not explain to either myself or someone else.  Knowing the essence of my existence allows me now look into this world using faith that all is well and doing the jobs the system was designed to do.  I look at the teachings of prophet s differently and have come to the realization that Jesus's messages are the closest to my core belief.    After my personal experiences, I find more peace around me and I am no longer ambitious,  Becoming awake is very differcult to explain.  But without a doubt, I will say ""God Exists"".  I also wanted to add that my experiences were not drug related but I have read many stories that did come from chemical stgimulation and they share similarities to my experience."

First at 23 years old (void experience).  Second at just over 50, (paradise experience). Since the second one I have had many strange experiences like waking with knowledge, bouts of being filled with incrediable love at the oddest moment, predictions on a personal level and world stage, and finding lost things.  I cant control any of these though.  I had a dream two days ago about medical students being shot.  The dream very vivid (again) and I woke with a gun shot type pain in my knee thigh area.  This one could have been a blood clot and the dream was a personal warning. :)  Anyway, strange things do happen in this world and many times its easier to just notice them and try not to explain them."

religion,3c0p7f,habzsauce,5,Fri Jul 3 18:23:32 2015 UTC,"It might be worth it to point out that you're looking to connect to Jesus in new ways. You feel stifled by a church setting, and feel the need to observe the Holy Trinity and worship them from the home that they've made instead of the building Man houses them in. You feel disenfranchised, like the trappings and monotonous droning sermons have driven the life and vitality of the holy Father beyond your reach. You believe in studying Jesus's word yourself, instead of hearing a citation and listening as someone tells you what it's supposed to mean. You want a chance to connect with God on a more personal level, explore the world He made, and find the spots where He will show His love for you, hidden for only you to find. In church, you're shown what the pastor sees, along with the entire congeegation, and you feel like overall, your absence would barely register in their minds.  If you're over 14 and in the US, you're legally allowed to have a preferred parent in custody talks; isn't that old enough to know where you want to see God, and how you want to perceive Him?   I think more than anything, your pastor and parents are afraid you'll pick up one of those ""crazy new-age religions"" where Christians assume (since,""judge first and ask questions never"" has proven a sound method of judgement against local faiths and in crusades) that devils and evil spirits are worshipped and summoned to wreak havoc and destroy ""God's greatest gift to humanity, the Earth."" Hopefully they'll at least believe you when you say you're walking a Christian path of spiritual enlightenment and personal discovery. Hell, you can even google and cite instances where Jesus didn't always see eye to eye with Joseph and Mary when he was your age, and the Pastor would certainly like that.  Maybe after making your point heard, instead of railing at them and crying, ""Why won't you let me discover God for myself!"" try asking, ""What do you fear, why are you afraid to let me walk in my Father's kingdom, to meet Him in grace and joy, and walk His land, learning of His love and why he was willing to give his only child for the salvation of us all?""  You're young, and have yet to learn the finer points of debate and compromise. You're young, and your parents have yet to see you as the sentinent being you are becoming. You're young, and they think you're in a phase. You're uoung, and they think you're gullible enough to be seduced into working for Satan. You're young, and even if they don't concede to the logic and points set out, you'll have ample opportunity to explore your faith as an adult.

Broken down, is ""Al-lah"" to mean ""The God."" This word is used for the God of Abraham regardless of whether one is reading the Christian Bible or the Quran.

That said I'm still ok with gay marriage, especially as a state or federally given contract."
religion,3bv2ri,beardtamer,2,Thu Jul 2 12:04:40 2015 UTC,"Very few people think the Bible condemns interracial marriage today, but when SCOTUS ruled on Loving v. Virginia in 1967 most people thought it did. Many churches very specifically refused to bless the marriages of interracial couples, and stridently opposed the legal recognition of such marriages based on the deeply held religious belief that such marriages were biblically condemned. The judge who initially convicted the Lovings for ""miscegenation"" wrote in his decision:   ""Almighty God created the races white, black, yellow, malay and red, and he placed them on separate continents. And but for the interference with his arrangement there would be no cause for such marriages. The fact that he separated the races shows that he did not intend for the races to mix.""   This was the overwhelmingly common perspective of most white US Christians at the time. In Biblical justification, the story of Ham was often cited with the the ""mark"" he was said to carry interpreted as dark sin. As this ""mark"" was seen as denoting moral and spiritual inferiority, to mix ""pure"" white families with ""cursed"" dark ones was seen as against the will of God. Various passages that condemned the mixing of unlike things (fabric, hybrid animals or plants, planting two crops in one field, etc) were cited as showing that God intended people to mix ""like with like"" and thus forbade interracial marriages.  Similarly, the story of Cain and Abel says Cain was ""marked"" before being sent out, and this was widely accepted as meaning he was dark skinned. By extension, various passages forbidding Israelites from marrying Canaanites were interpreted as forbidding interracial marriage.   Some of the specific passages that were used to justify ""miscegenation"" laws:   Acts 17:24-26: ""God ... hath made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on all the face of the earth, and hath determined the times before appointed, and the bounds of their habitation ...""   Here we get the biblical references the judge in the Loving trial was probably alluding to. Different ""races"" were seen as having been placed on separate continents, the ""bounds of their habitation"", and therefor never meant to mix.   Genesis 28:1: ""And Isaac called Jacob, and blessed him, and charged him, and said unto him, Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan.""   Cain was ""marked"" and presumed dark skinned. To marry a ""daughter of Canaan"" was presumed to mean to marry a black woman.   Deuteronomy 7:2-3: ""And when the LORD thy God shall deliver them [Amorites, Canaanites, Girgashites, Hittites, Hivites, Jebusites, and Perizzites] before thee; thou shalt smite them, and utterly destroy them; thou shalt make no covenant with them, nor shew mercy unto them: Neither shalt thou make marriages with them; thy daughter thou shalt not give unto his son, nor his daughter shalt thou take unto thy son.""   Today this passage is generally interpreted as forbidding marriage with non-Israelites on religious grounds. In the mid-20th century the Israelites were generally treated as the ""white"" group, with their neighbors the cursed and inferior dark skinned populations they were forbidden from intermarrying with.   Deuteronomy 22:9: ""Thou shalt not sow thy vineyard with divers seeds: lest the fruit of thy seed which thou hast sown, and the fruit of thy vineyard, be defiled.""   God doesn't like mixing unlike things. In America for centuries this logic was extended to the assumption that God doesn't want ""unlike races"" to intermarry.   Jeremiah 13:23: ""Can an Ethiopian change the color of his skin? Can a leopard take away its spots? Neither can you start doing good, for you have always done evil.""   While the author of Jeremiah may have meant the reference to dark Ethiopian skin as neutrally as the reference to a leopard's spots, this was taken for many centuries as proof that dark skin was a sign of inherent immorality. To intermarry with that darkness was believed to taint a bloodline and curse any children produced.  And these racist interpretations didn't die out long ago. As a child I had white, elderly southern family members who still devoutly believed that this was God's revealed and eternal truth. This is still an interpretation that is in the living memory of people alive today.  Edit: spelling"
religion,3bv2ri,tgjer,2,Fri Jul 3 02:53:23 2015 UTC,Something similar happened with slavery in the US.  Before the Civil War lots of Christians felt the Bible supported slavery.  Now almost no Christian would argue that it does.
religion,3bv2ri,beauty_dior,1 point,Fri Jul 3 09:12:47 2015 UTC,"So the Bible does not say much about interracial marriage, just marriage that compromises a person's own religious upbringing.    They're called ""interfaith"" or even ""mixed"" marriages. But given that Judaism is both a religion and an ethnicity, it's not unreasonable to view this as against interethnic marriages, too.  That's not to say one should follow the prohibition if so. They are many other things much less acceptable (e.g., executing people who work on the sabbath) that one has to ignore before getting to this issue."
religion,3bv2ri,Splarnst,3,Thu Jul 2 13:20:03 2015 UTC,I would say that in the context of the Biblical passage its self it is almost entirely interfaith marriages the bible speaks on and not interracial. There are examples of people assimilating in Jewish religion in order to e married and it simply was not a racial or cultural problem God seems to be telling them to avoid but the issue is driven entirely because of the fear that men or women marrying into other faiths and losing their own convictions or allegiance to God.

I think this is tricky to explain but is important, so please excuse the length.  BahÃ¡'Ã­s, like many other religions, believe that God has created us all; has given us a life that's precious, beautiful and eternal; is, in fulness of time, perfectly just to every person and our closest friend.  We further have names for God like the All-Bountiful, the All-Knowning, the All-Mighty, the Most Generous, and the like.  Nobody can claim to wrap their minds around God, or have a real understanding of Him.  In the BahÃ¡'Ã­ writings it says, ""Ye shall be hindered from loving Me and souls shall be perturbed as they make mention of Me. For minds cannot grasp Me nor hearts contain Me.""  Then there are the messengers of God.  Taking Abrahamic religions for example: Jews believe in Moses as a prophet who revealed the Torah; Christians believe that too but also that Christ was a prophet (or God himself, depending on who you ask), whose life was recorded in the Gospels; Muslims believe that too, but also that Mohammad was a prophet who revealed the Quran; and BahÃ¡'Ã­s believe that too, but also that the BÃ¡b and BahÃ¡'u'llÃ¡h are prophets (and that there will be more in the future).  The point of all this is that we believe these prophets have delivered a divine and beautiful message (a gift!) from this all-powerful, unknowable being -- and this kindles in our hearts a deep appreciation and love for the prophet/God (you can think of them as being identical, or distinct), and that's what connects many to religion."
religion,3bqnxg,bchurchill,1 point,Thu Jul 2 08:39:54 2015 UTC,"An additional reason for the connection to religion may be due to the fear of attempting to discover our source (God) and self as they exist, without the bias of other's interpretations, and without human imposed structure (religion). It's like saying that if we go to college it means we've really learned something. If we don't go to college then our knowledge isn't as valid, even if it's better. College can be seen as a validation of our knowledge.  Religion gives a way for a person to justify and validate beliefs about existence since the religion is acceptable to society at large and many people follow. There's comfort in numbers, ritual and structure. If our quest to understand life weren't so strong I doubt the connection would be that important. But, if we don't have a solid basis upon which we are living our lives we are adrift in a very big place. That's pretty scary if you don't know how to trust life. For some it's more valuable to build a foundation on something, even if its stability is questionable."

religion,3bgm95,restorationblogger,1 point,Mon Jun 29 01:26:36 2015 UTC,The separation of church and state was engineered into society for a specific purpose. To insure that tyranny by the church could never raise its head in this country. The founding fathers understood quite clearly that in Europe the spectre of the Catholic Church wielding political power was devastating. Millions were killed to advance the Church's goals and there were wars fought over these power grabs. Keeping the Catholic Church out of power on the New World was extremely important. The Fathers realized that any church would try to gain power.
religion,3bgm95,butch123,0,Tue Jun 30 01:29:08 2015 UTC,"Not exactly. It was created to avoid a state-sponsored Religion, which yes was the Catholic Church...

religion,3bgm95,reptaaarrr,1 point,Tue Jun 30 01:34:26 2015 UTC,"The Separation of powers in the US government is commonly believed to give certain powers to one branch of government, and to deny certain powers to other branches. The whole scheme, from the beginning was designed to limit ANY role that religion can have in government. The federalist papers make this clear. The German Princes supporting the Lutheran Church were considered a faction against the Catholic Church but not considered a solution as a replacement so the scheme to prevent any church having a role in government was instituted. The history of the Catholic Church was one of political power and influence in Europe. The church caused wars. The Reformation was a history of war until the Islamic forces threatened Europe and the Pope realized that he needed the military strength of the Germanic Princes to help stop the Muslims from advancing. That was when peace in Europe was realized."

I'll grab my book later and get some quotes and notes from the Founding Fathers themselves later, but that's not specifically what it was for.  IF I remember correctly, it was inspired by Baptists who pushed for the Government to not sponsor a specific religion, because in Virginia there was an unsaid ""official"" religion (The Puritans, I believe) and under that belief system, non-Puritans who didn't hold the same beliefs, were being punished and fined for working on the Sabbath.  Like I said, I'll double check and come back with the source, just winging it right now.   But I do know that the intent of the ""Separation"" was NEVER to ban Religion from [inset place here] for fear of power - it was designed to give Religious Freedom from a Government who would try to impose a specific Religion upon the People."

religion,3bgm95,cheejudo,-2,Mon Jun 29 20:59:37 2015 UTC,"Ugh.... first sentence in her first paragraph I feel the need to address...  This country WAS in fact, founded on Judeo-Christian beliefs and ideals. It's not something that's really up for debate. While it was founded with the basis on freedom(s) previously not provided to the people (religion, speech, press, etc), the founding fathers CLEARLY were influenced by the teachings of Christianity in forming this new country. Even skeptics like Franklin and Jefferson acknowledged the existence of ""Divine Providence"", etc.  The commonly pounded-on concept of ""Separation of Church and State"" by those seeking to eliminate Religious anything from public, was designed so that the Government would't be authorized to push a State-Sponsored Religion upon people that was different than their own. It was designed to PROTECT people of various religions from being persecuted under the beliefs of others, specifically if one was state-sponsored (think: working on the Sabbath, could be punishable under beliefs of specific denominations).  This concept was NEVER designed to keep Religion out of Schools or places of Government. It's been the greatest Revisionist nonsense ever spewed.   Beyond that, most of her argument is (and should be) directed at the minority of true Christians who are taking Old Testament stuff and trying to apply it, which doesn't work - or the people who have no idea what they're talking about. They might be most vocal, but they're the minority.  As an American, I believe in Freedom. People should be free to love who they love, and free to do pretty much whatever they want, as long as it's not hurting someone else.  As a Christian, I believe that we're to expect non-believers to sin - why wouldn't they? We're supposed to respond in love and understanding, not judgement and anger; not to try and force people to live by God's word if they're not believers. That's pointless. At the same time, Homosexuality is a sin, just Pride, Greed, etc etc - choosing to remain in sin is choosing to disobey God, and ultimately choosing damnation. But that goes for ANY sinful lifestyle. People like to target things that were referred to as ""abominable"" in the Old Testament and break out the ""OMG YOU'RE GOING TO HELL"".... whereas the truth is, there are no sins that are ""worse"" than others, sin is sin. So Homosexuals aren't any ""worse"" in Gods eyes than a man sleeping around on his wife who continues to do so even though he knows it's wrong - it's all sin, period."

The Christian political group who fought for the right to hand out bibles and other religious materials in school only to do a complete 180 turn and try to ban it wholesale when the Satanists showed up.  I'd take a lot of this talk about things not being intended to keep religion out of schools and government and so forth if people were more accepting of the fact that that's a double edged sword, rather than expecting it to turn the schools and governments into their private playgrounds.   I would view this whole idea as more than just an infantile temper tantrum if it wasn't.... Just bloody well that. ""NO! NO! The right to distribute religious material in schools is MINE!

That's one of the things that's so silly about the ""this Country was not founded as a Christian Nation"" arguments. People were taught how to read. Why? For the purpose of reading the Bible. The examples are countless, and for all the forethought of the Founding Fathers, they never anticipated non-Christian religions (I don't believe, at least) to be in the fabric of society the way they are today.  I don't believe it's a ""have your cake and eat it too""-esque argument, I believe that it's more of a ""you're bastardizing the genuine intentions of the founding fathers"" notion.  I mean it's another topic for another day, but Gun Control is quite similar. They weren't talking about the right to own an AR-15 or not, they were talking about muskets and pistols. Same line of thinking, here.   Our entire belief system, justice, morality, crime and punishment - it all stems from Judeo-Christian principles. So that being the case, it sounds quite ridiculous to spit in the very face of the principles (and where they come from) that shaped the very country we live in.  I don't think necessarily that kids should be forced to learn about Christianity nor pray in schools at all - that was never the intent. But to BAN it? That wasn't the purpose, either. Separation of Church and State was to guarantee religious freedom, certainly NOT ""freedom from Religion""."

I went from Christian to atheist to taoist to everything. Christian, Hindu, you name it, I read it and believe it. I call myself a syncrenist.    Many atheists become atheists along the path you described, as a reaction to a religion that was thrust upon them. I was no different. Until I read the tao te ching on a whim, because it's more philosophical than religious.   When I read the tao te ching, it made a lot of sense to me. It was logical yet poetic, and free of dogma. After that, I began to see that the other religions were really only different on the surface. If you read into them for yourself, instead of just listening to what some priest or your family says, you may be very surprised. You may not - it depends what you read. Some religions have been more aggressively co-opted by politics than others. But in all religions there are certain saints, sages, or mystics whose writings are less corrupted. You should try to read these.   Another problem with religion is that much of it was not written for the average reader. In Christianity for instance, and other religions, half of the texts are full of complex references to things you've never heard of, and intense symbolic imagery. It's meant for theologians.   So there are a lot of reasons why religion in the average persons life has become completely bastardized and ridiculous. Christ, real or not, is not talking about an invisible bearded grandpa who watches everything you do, and hates it when you masturbate. I don't know how to explain it to you, but you could try the tao te ching, it worked for me.   In the end, I am supremely interested in religion because it deals with the most important questions, questions that science doesn't even begin to look at. Questions like what is matter, why do we experience time. This is a deep part of religion that I'm guessing you've never been exposed to. In essence, God is no different than the summation of all matter in the universe, which is consciousness - and also all emptiness. That's why, for instance, Christian mystic Meister Eckhart said ""the eye through which I see God is the eye through which God sees me."" So I'm doing a pretty bad job of talking about it, but there's a reason people dedicate their whole lives to it. Another important aspect of religion is happiness. It's not about asceticism, but freedom from attachments which cause suffering. There's really so much going on, it's just so hard to talk to people that have never read deeply or thought about it for themselves. But you are asking with sincerity, and for that I wish you good luck.   Edit: someone who can explain all this as a better introduction is Alan Watts - check it out on YouTube.

I will definitely check out the video, and since becoming an atheist, I've been trying to read up on other religions and dive deeper. I've found a lot of reasons for people following a faith, and some are good reasons (for instance, it makes them happy), but the way I'm still seeing it, is its similar to a comfort food. When you get stressed? You grab some potato chips. When you get stressed? You pray. Praying is obviously a lot healthier for your body, but the way I look at it, putting your fear and love into God is lying to yourself.    Ok, that was a horrible example, but do you get what I'm saying? Instead of worrying about what happens when you die, you just put your faith in God instead of accepting that we don't know what happens. And it's so hard to accept the unknown, and before we had science to show us how everything worked, religion was a good explanation, but now I just don't see the need for it besides using it as a way to protect us from what we are too afraid to accept. And I don't look down on people who use faith in this way. I think I can say with confidence that over the last few years especially, people are throwing away the exact teaching and politics that go along with religion (which is the part I despise), and just summing it up to ""I love God. I have faith he loves me and will be there for me. Do good things, and good things will happen."" Which I think is amazing, because I think it's a good way for people to feel spiritual and live there life but not have to worry about every little thing they do because they are worried they will offend someone (whether they be mortal or Devine).   In a way, I'm jealous. I wish I could simply start believing again so I didn't have to worry about the unknown, but I can't undo what I (think I) know. So with atheism, as much as you fill your mind with reason and support your thoughts with logic, there are simply things you cannot know (at least, at this point in history).   If I were answering my own question, id say that people who revert back to faith were never true atheist to begin with, because once you truly accept the unknown, there's no way to go back. I'm not saying I'm not still weary of what I don't know, but I accept that I will have to wait and see, or maybe never find out?  As far as religion being above the average person's head, I totally agree. I am in no way saying I have done more than dipped a toe in the vast expanse that makes up the totality of religion, but I do understand that most of what is taught is not literal, and I wish a lot more people realized that but again, it's their choice on how they live there life and as long as no one forces there religion upon me, I will not force my atheism on them.  On another note, no one can say that religion, which a lot of the time encourages peace, has brought an unbelievable amount of chaos to this earth... But maybe that can be my next post lol  All in all, as long as everyone can live in peace within their own realm of reality, I am happy. Though I do love to discuss the topic and hear other people's points of view.   Thank you so much for sharing with me and if you have anymore books/links/videos that would help me in my quest for understanding, I'd be happy to check them out."
religion,3bfihr,johannthegoatman,2,Tue Jun 30 04:11:03 2015 UTC,"Funny how you say that you can't believe I was truly atheist, because I was the most angry and militant atheist you could possibly imagine. I straight up called religious people stupid to their face, and accused people of turning to religion out of fear just as you are now. But I really respect and appreciate that you are not like I was. It's all part of the journey I suppose.   Anyways, I just wanted to respond to a few points. Based on your response, I think your view of what ""a religious person"" is is a lot different from mine. If you come from a bible thumping sort of location, I pretty much agree with your assessment of those people. But in the interest of bringing a broader perspective, let me share a little bit about what religion is for me. For one, it's about embracing the unknown. ""The sage steers his course by the torch of chaos and doubt"" - Chuang tzu. It's about living in the present moment, and realizing that past and future thoughts are nothing but abstractions with no reality. You don't have to be religious to live that way - check out Sam Harris, he's written some amazing stuff from an atheist perspective.   But on another point, my religious leanings are based not in faith (though I do recognize that as an alternative, though often bastardized path) but in reason. I think through logic it is philosophically provable that matter is consciousness. There is no perceiver or perceived as objects, only perception. For a very straightforward albeit antiquated treatise on this subject, check out the philosopher George Berkeley. This isn't some obscure whacky position by the way, it's called idealism, as opposed to materialism - the belief in matter. Check it out on Wikipedia.   So to make a long story short, I find that philosophy and religion are the closest models of reality using logic and reason. You do have to know how to separate the wheat from the chaff, which is why a lot of people don't get it. Or get lost in the politics of it all. For me, religion is not at all about anti intellectual fear appeasement. In fact, it's quite the opposite. Studying religion, for me, asks you to truly face your own mortality, which is something many atheists and believers refuse to do. They would rather watch TV or play video games than think about death. By the way, heaven is on earth, it has nothing to do with the afterlife ;)"
religion,3bfihr,divanvisagie,0,Tue Jun 30 18:36:54 2015 UTC,"Oh! And as far as philosophy goes, I don't think there's any question that religion has asked that the average open minded person wouldn't ask science."

If they just abandon the religion because they aren't too bothered about it and leave it at that and seek no other answers I would say they would be able to return. But if they lost faith due to an understanding that cannot change(evolution) , moral incompatibility and deep research then I think reverting to faith is almost impossible."

religion,3bfihr,grant_cir,1 point,Mon Jun 29 05:16:27 2015 UTC,"I was raised as a part-time churchgoer... my mother was divorced and therefore shunned from the Catholic Church, which led her to seek denominations that weren't as strict so that she'd be able to feel comfortable in service, taking communion, etc. She never pushed religion on me, but she did her part in making it available and by the time I was 12, I had read the Bible front to back a few times, but it was just something interesting to read... I was never truly a god-fearing child; I said my prayers at night and before dinner, but that was pretty much the extent of it. Checking off the boxes for the day of daily tasks I was raised with.  Fast forward to my late teen years - Would categorize myself as an arrogantly proud atheist. I would mock believers, joke about Jesus and God, tell my Mom she was a moron for believing the hocus-pocus, and in general, the same arguments that most young atheists cling to (Jesus is equivalent to Santa Claus, right?).  So here I am today. I'm 33 years old, I have four children. What started as taking the kids to Church for a good moral foundation has brought me full-circle in faith. After years and years of rejecting the notion that there is a divine God, or the existence of Jesus Christ as any more than a prophet, I've come to the belief that I was flat-out wrong. And that took some humility to admit. That was painful, the pride I had to swallow.  See, my issues with ""God"" were more based in ""religion"". Of course, I never took the time to really look into them as I painted Christianity with the same broad brush and wrote it all off once I began to ""think for myself"". It wasn't until I started coming to Church again as a father and mature adult, 15 years removed from anything religious at all mind you, that I began to connect some dots and reevaluate my stance.  You see, Catholicism and denominations of similar belief systems were all that I had known. Yet when I began to find out that these denominations are littered with ""tradition"" and completely non-bible teachings and beliefs, I was blown away. What do you mean that Confession isn't biblical? Stuff like that. Come to find out, I didn't have a problem with the Bible and God insomuch as I had a problem with Religion. Slowly, I allowed myself to take an open-minded approach.  Our Pastor knew I was a skeptic when we first started going. My wife was diving head-first into it, and I was lagging. He gave me a book, some of you may know it. ""A Case for Christ"" by Lee Stroebel. Reading it with a skeptical mind, I was surprised to see myself starting to come around on the entire concept of Jesus Christ, Salvation, God, etc. More than anything, it was like a punch in the gut. My old self would have punched this new, open-minded self in the eye for considering believing in Santa Claus, The Easter Bunny, and Jesus Christ. But here I was, teetering on the edge.  October 27, 2013 I was saved. I actually prayed for forgiveness for my sins - past, present, and future. I prayed that the Lord would help my and my family through our hardships and to just show me that he was real, to give me a sign that I was wrong all those years. In my head, I felt that I sounded like an idiot... yet given the circumstances in our life at the time, I was desperate. I was past the point of being in control of things, and it seemed as if things were spiraling with no way to stabilize them.  For the first time in my adult life, I had to put my trust, my faith in something beyond myself. And it worked. Not only did it work, but it worked literally at the last possible second. And not only did our situation turn a complete 180, but things suddenly went from what we needed, to more than we ever had. And the only change was becoming faithful believers. That's it.   In the past 20-or so months, there have been multiple occurrences of faith being rewarded. In the past, I would have just chalked things up to good fortune or luck. But not things as major as the things we've experienced. Not this many times in such a short span. Not like this. Ironically, it's all too""coincidental"" to be coincidence.   And you know what? Not everything has been roses and unicorns and rainbows and gumdrops. There's been storms. There's been low points that have tested both my wife and myself, and yet somehow we've managed through faith, whereas I can say confidently years ago, our marriage would have been over.  I need to see things to believe them. I need proof. I may not have ""proof"" that Jesus paid for our sins on the cross, and rose from the dead three days later. I may not have seen it with my own eyes. But I've seen things happen in my own life that wouldn't have been possible without faith, and these things are proof enough for me that I'm investing myself into something I do believe in. That's the only proof I need to know that I'm a believer.  I don't look at it as moving backwards, I look at it as growing up and swallowing the pride of my youth. It takes humility to have true faith, and sometimes the only way to find that humility is to have life beat you down to the bottom so badly that you have no other option but to put your faith into something greater than yourself.  At the end of the day, to each their own. I'm not going to force someone to try and believe if they don't want to, and no Christian should. But to those willing to open their hearts and minds, it could be the door to finding faith and changing your life for the better. Your mileage may vary..."
religion,3bfihr,stainslemountaintops,1 point,Mon Jun 29 14:41:08 2015 UTC,"First off, love your username.  Second, I will definitely check out that book just to see what it has to say.  Ok, so I don't mean to criticize your reason for turning to God (which, from what I understand is you basically felt like you were out of options and looking for something to make your life better) but from what I gather, you put your faith in God because you feared the unknown. Things were so bad and you just didn't know where else to turn, and God was a way of reassuring yourself that in the end, everything will work out. That's the way I'm looking at this, from what you've told me. Maybe there just isn't a way for me to see it the way you do because I'm not in the same state of mind as you, and it's obviously hard to convey what you're thinking over a screen, but the way you describe the evolution of your religious views can be very easily explained. It makes me think you were never a true atheist. I think you definitely doubted your faith for many years to the point where you could sum it up as loosing your belief all together and turning to atheism, but in the back of your mind you always truly believed. Just at the time, you didn't have a need for faith, so you turned against it, but when the going got tough, you fell right into faiths lap, no matter how hard it may have been to swallow your pride at first.  Now don't get me wrong, I support everyone in whatever faith they choose to follow. Frankly, because it's their right to choose how they live they're life, and sometimes faith is the little push that gets one through to the next day. For now, I remain a complete skeptic and look to scientists for everything I need answered, and for the unanswered, I simply accept that it is something I cannot know, that is so out of my realm of understanding it makes my head spin lol but I will continue to use science to further my understanding of the universe and dedicate my life to the pursuit of knowledge so that maybe one day my great, great grandchildren can answer the questions I never even thought of.... But who knows? In ten years I may in full blown faith mode. Thanks for sharing with me! I hope you and your beautiful family continue to live long, happy lives!"

religion,3bf2ob,The_Goa_Force,3,Sun Jun 28 18:28:01 2015 UTC,"Over time, religions have depreciated the social status of women, but when they started, they helped to developped their condition. For instance, Muhammad elevated the status of women in the traditionnal Arabis society. He first abolished the practice of burying female babies. He made them wear a veil that, before Islam, was only reserved to the elite, as a sign of respect for them. He also came up with laws authorizing them to possess their own wealth, to inherit, to divorce, to go the mosque by themselves, etc. It was very progressive, as he made the Arabs understand that a woman was a person by herself (the Pagan arabs thought a woman to be a person through a male family member). In Sikhism, the Gurus established a full equality between men and women, who enjoyed the same rights. All of them were renamed 'Kaur', which means 'princess"", to signify their value as human beings. In the Baha'i Faith, women were recognized fully responsible for themselves and spiritually equal to men. The very first women allowed to vote in Persia in the XIXth century were Baha'i women voting to elect religious assemblies. Also, in the Gospel, I can but notice the high degree of value that is given to women. Mary is described as a very pure being. Also, Jesus spent a lot of time talking to women (some of them weren't even from his own nation), and he also protected them : here I think of the aborted stoning of Mary of Magdala, and of the law that impeached Christian divorces, which was a mean to compell husbands to take care of their spouses."

Perhaps some people had spiritual experiences, and then confused aspects of their own psyche with the divine, like novices often do. Some novices even believe that they themselves are God, because they don't understand the nature of the unity of consciousness with the divine. And then they're like ""GOD WANTS YOU TO JUMP ON ONE LEG FOR 5 TIMES A DAY TO PURIFY YOURSELF!"".   Seems they were unaware that the path to spiritual experience is full of illusion, and that the divine, unlike the ego, has no needs or wants which would affect human life. It neither needs your worship or belief, nor does it want to control your lifestyle. For it it doesn't make a difference if you believe in a many-faced God-collective, or the one and only flying spaghetti monster. It is only primitive egos who want you to worship it, and want to control your lifestyle. They are full of needs and wants, and they threaten you with supernatural punishment if you don't fulfill their needs and wants.   Basically they are pretending to be God, to make you do as they tell you. Jesus turning water into wine, just like his resurrection, is just a story to make you believe that Jesus was more than just a human with (possibly profound) spiritual experience."
religion,3bf2ob,grant_cir,1 point,Mon Jun 29 13:13:09 2015 UTC,"""if God didn't exist, it would be necessary to invent him"" - Voltaire  The thing that distinguishes humans from nearly all other animals (we are an animal) is that we transmit knowledge through language - something really no other animals do, certainly not written language (which is exponentially more powerful than the spoken word for amassing and transmitting vast quantities of knowledge.  We have an enormous body of knowledge which has built up in a tiny, tiny period of time, during which, unlike every other animal, we've more or less escaped the bonds of physical evolution to adapt, and now adapt through intellectual and knowledge based evolution.  This gives us two problems: how to collect and how to organize that knowledge.   Think of the first words of genesis: ""In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God""  Religion is an invention of man that performs a vital role of cataloging (containing) all the collected knowledge, and organizing it.  There is one more thing human evolution leads to. Our very great and special magical skill, the thing that lets us dominate everything else, is the ability to learn new patterns.  We are pre-disposed to see patterns - to recognize patterns - and this is so strong in us that we will see patterns where only randomness exists (there are tons of neuroscience and psychology studies to show this).  We crave a pattern -> order -> purpose.    Religion offers a way to thematically organize all the knowledge in the world.  If you look, historically, at the role of religion in civilization, it was to warehouse and organize all human understanding.    Much of that, in the modern age, has been supplanted by science.  Scientific reasoning - objectivism, naturalism and empiricism (thank you Francis Bacon) - has proven superior (more successful at) to theology at explaining the universe we encounter around us.  Many religious revisionists are fond of saying religion and science aren't inherently in conflict or competion - but this is revisionism, and ignores that for millenia most religions have purported to explain the natural as well as the supernatural world.  Science so thoroughly routed Relgion by the end of the 19th century that basically religion started to shut up about trying to explain the natural world, and retreated purely into the super-natural, where it could not be tested.   However, Science still lacks ""purpose""...or rather, our ""purpose"" in science is pretty simple: procreate[1] and that's a little...unsatisfying as a ""cosmic purpose"" kind of answer.  So people cling to that part of religion.  Many people, increasingly, talk of ""deeper purpose"" or ""spirituality"" than adherence to a particular theology & cosmology (much less dogma), and the more information transparency exists in the world. the faster restrictive dogmas will die off.    Interestingly, the more people lack a strong sense of internal control, order and purpose, the more they crave external sources of order and authority to tell them how to think and what to do; much of this is at odds with the Jesus of the Sermon on the Mount, and even moreso Buddhist thought (though not Confucian).    Regardless of this internal/external loci of control question, I am doubtful whether most people will ever come to accept the idea that our ""purpose"" is merely to live for several (many?) decades, have offspring and then disappear (eternally), so the need to believe in an ""afterlife"" will remain very powerful (and it seems science keeps pointing more and more the other way: there is no supernatural afterlife).    Now reflect on another thing that Voltaire said:  ""Man will never be free until the last king is strangled with the entrails of the last priest""   ...and on the fact that both Francis Bacon and Voltaire were products of (producers of?) the Renaissance and ensuing (and appropriately named) Enlightenment; keep in mind the bit about loci of control.    [1] The most hilarious irony, to me, is the revealing obsession most fundamentalists (of all religions!) have focuses on the rules regarding reproduction - they, more than anyone, are slaves to the Evoluationary Imperative to reproduce: they are literally obsessed with sex.

What this means is that you are likely basing your opinions off of someone else's interpretation of a non-litteral translation. All I am saying is that you can and should look at the source material for yourself.  I'm gonna leave you this, explaining why this condemnation of ""abomination"" is a poor translation,  http://religiondispatches.org/does-the-bible-really-call-homosexuality-an-abomination/ This, discussing the fact that Paul was probably going against pederasty, a practice when a teacher takes sexual liberties with a student, http://forums.catholic.com/showthread.php?t=122548  and this, explaining that the leviticus verse is also about this practice, because they had different words for male and female, http://stopbibleabuse.org/biblical-references/leviticus.html Here's the part where the reason that Sodom and its sister cities are condemned is that everyone is wicked and bad to strangers, so he sends an agent to see if ten good people can be found and he can't find one.  They die for ungodliness, not gay stuff. http://www.str.org/articles/what-was-the-sin-of-sodom-and-gomorrah#.VZACSmD-_o4   As Young (who wrote a literal translation) discovered (check his introduction, its in the first two pages), The King James Version does not have any place where two verses appear back to back with the same meaning as the original.  Most of the time this is adding in articles and switching around which words are singular and plural,  but often the subject and object are mixed up, something is changed from a negative to a positive or vis a versa, or a word is just completely substituted. This means that when you read a word for word bible and a regular bible, many chapters and verses are actually asking us to do something totally different.  We are supposed to be anti-pedophilia, not anti-homosexual.  There are older traditions that say king David and his friend Jonathan were lovers, in the greek warrior/lover/best friend mold, which most Americans are unaware of.   I don't really understand what allowing homosexuals to marry in the US has to do with people dying at peace because of their faith in the Mediterranean. They seem to be unrelated events that you are trying to use to guilt us as Christians, but those attacks were set in motion independently from the events that set the supreme court decision in motion.    Also, stopping people from caring for each other and celebrating their love doesn't seem very ""do unto others"" or ""turn the other cheek"" or ""love thy neighbors/enemies as thyself."" How would Jesus handle this? Probably exactly like how he did while the Greeks and Romans had gay sex: by focusing on doing kindnesses for the community, not getting upset, talking with compassion, and thinking more about spiritual development and salvation.  He never went on the war path, and when people tried to get him to, he refused and kept going with the love, self-sacrifice, and compassion.  So maybe you should try and be like the person you claim to follow."

We can ask all sorts of questions about what justifies beliefs in Christianity, whether or not being gay actually risks hellfire, what justifies asserting your views of what is good for someone over and against what they think is good for them, how religious motivation should factor into law and political representation, why homosexuality is emphasized for condemnation more than other sins, etc. None of that, however, should be taken to mean that loving gay people has to mean supporting their same-sex relationships (legally or culturally) any more than loving a heroin addict has to mean supporting (legally or culturally) their right to use heroin."

religion,3b9r6j,hawkael20,2,Sat Jun 27 04:26:23 2015 UTC,"I would like to point out that the use of blanket terms should probably be avoided. I was raised a Roman Catholic and currently attend a Roman Catholic school, however we are taught that love thy neighbor supersedes most other things. Being gay is absolutely frowned on by many in the church, but there are many who are supportive of gay rights, myself included. If we are taught to forgive and love our enemies, we are also taught to love our neighbors regardless of creed, race, sexuality, etc. It is simply that due to changes in the Church around the 60's, teaching became more lax which has created a sort of schism within the members of the church; those who are progressive and bring the word of God into a modern context, and those who can't move on past bigotry and hate."

religion,3b9r6j,accieyn,5,Sat Jun 27 05:19:13 2015 UTC,"I think the blanket term was Christian.  There are many different denominations that are not opposed to marriage equality or LGBTQ+ rights, so it's inappropriate to lump all the denominations together and say ""why don't Christians X"" or ""why isn't X more important to Christians than Y"".  The United Church of Christ is a denomination that (generally) doesn't believe being gay is a sin, is pro-marriage equality, ordains LGBTQ+ people, and is pretty much super liberal compared to other Christian denominations.  Saying ""why don't Christians X"" is ignoring the existence of these churches and denominations that do X. It's not just a small, small portion of Christians and denominations that are pro-marriage equality, either. One particular group of Christians is ultra-vocal in their distaste of marriage equality and LGBTQ+ rights, so people often associate their beliefs to all Christians.  Qualifying the statement with a specific type of Christians may be more appropriate - like ""why do fundamentalist Christians do X"" or ""why do Biblical literalists think X"" because you're more likely to get an accurate answer or an answer that is more relevant to your question."

religion,3b7j4a,NoEscap3,19,Tue Jun 30 20:50:22 2015 UTC,"The thing is, this decision isn't about forcing religious people to accept gay marriage. It's about following the provisions provided in the Constitution and its amendments. The 14th Amendment guarantees all citizens equal treatment under the law. This includes and is not limited to laws governing the formation of contracts between two mutually consenting parties, which is what marriage is in terms of law.  States that have passed anti-gay-marriage laws have violated the 14th Amendment by saying, ""This specific group of people right here, we're going to treat them differently because we believe they are performing an egregious sin."" It singles out non-heterosexuals and says, ""Everyone can do this thing legally except for you. Tough stuff."" Which is patently illegal. It would be akin to saying, ""Any two people can enter into a contract except for people who eat bacon. Those people are not allowed. Why? Because the OT says you can't eat bacon, duh!""  Nobody is saying to religious congregations: ""You have to perform gay marriages now."" I wouldn't expect a gay couple to go up to a Baptist church and demand to be married. That's not what they're asking for. They're demanding that the government not deny them equal treatment to heterosexual couples. Religious groups have a right to object to and reject gay marriage as much as they want. But that right does not extend to the control of government. That means that if the government agrees to marry two individuals, they can't turn down other individuals for something as arbitrary as gender. I suppose if an individual in government is deeply opposed to performing a marriage for a gay couple based on religious reasons, that person should be able to recuse himself/herself from the act and pass that responsibility to someone else, but someone would still have to do it. We should not force people to act against deeply held personal beliefs. But on the other side of that coin, one individual's personal beliefs should not hinder the ability of other people to pursue something that is legally available to the majority of the population. Furthermore, that exemption only works on the individual level. Companies, regardless of the beliefs of those who govern them, must obey the law, and that means distributing benefits to legally married couples, whether they are gay or straight couples. The core of the argument is about the fact that, in banning gay marriage, states not only violate the 14th Amendment to the Constitution, but also violate the establishment clause (the one that says the government can't establish a State religion) of the 1st Amendment, legislating morality based on purely religious reasons.   Or you could look at it from another angle. If states are going to ban gay marriage based on religious reasons, what's next? Can they also make laws that ban bacon because pork is ""unclean"" (Deut. 14:8) or force rapists to pay a dowry to the father and marry the victim, as the OT commands in Deut. 22:28-29? No, that would be absurd. But the gay marriage debate is just as absurd. The fact that your religion forbids it does not extend to the rule of law in our country, which governs people of many different religious beliefs.   In short, I reiterate that it doesn't matter what you think of gay marriage. You may find it the most detestable thing on the earth, but you must also consider that others may find some of your views just as detestable. The only difference is that one group has systematically tried to limit another's freedoms. Gay marriage is no more an affront to religious freedom than eating bacon, drinking alcohol, or defacing images of Christ, all of which are perfectly legal and none of which have State laws against them (to my knowledge). It doesn't limit your ability to worship or command you to worship a specific god in a specific way. Churches still get ridiculous tax breaks and have no obligation to marry anyone they decide they don't want to marry. This ruling extends only to the government's role in performing marriages and distributing spousal rights and benefits."

I am completely for the right of gay people to marry, but I am also against forcing people to participate in actions they don't wish to, unless they are targeted at a specific minority group with the result of marginalization.

They were and are that way for any number of their adherents, but spirituality translates societally into religion, and religion is about group identity.  The king doesn't fund a cathedral because he digs Jeebus.  If he did, he'd build a bunch of soup kitchens.  The cathedral is built so he can show everyone that they should join his Look at the Size of My Dick club or at least fear the power of his throbbing stone... cathedral. Spirituality is only a dim relation of religion, and is only invited in the first place for its use as a social control.

But meanings, intenets and consciousness are not explained by materialism -- unless you consider random aggregation or spontaneous emergence as a satisfying explanation.   So, before the materialist goes in search of sophisticated means of explaining the origins of the universe, of life or of everything, he should first explain what in matter determines him or her to undergo such a search."

No, sorry, doesn't work that way. I look for the answers because I want to know the truth. If it turns out the truth is something supernatural, then fantastic, I'll believe that. But so far, everything we've researched, every event that used to be explained by the supernatural, whenever we've actually found the answer, it's turned out to be.... not magic."

religion,3b68tu,BarkingToad,5,Fri Jun 26 11:54:30 2015 UTC,"If such a ""law of matter"" exists, we will find it. If it doesn't, we will still have learned something by looking. You're presenting a very dishonest argument here: Your claim is that I shouldn't be looking for an answer unless I already know what it will be."
religion,3b68tu,BarkingToad,-1,Fri Jun 26 12:00:41 2015 UTC,"Actually, that's not what I'm saying. All this discussion revolves around the theory of materialism -- when you go looking for an answer using this theory as your foundation,  before you do that, you have to have these assumptions:  -consciousness exists (if not, then there's no ""I"" going to search anything)  -intentions exist (if not, there's no purpose propeling you into the search)  -meanings such as truth and false exist (you have to assume that you would know the difference between these things, therefore the concepts of true and false would have to already exist)  However, materialism does not explain those things (physics has no place for self-refering entities, nor purposefulness, nor meanings). So, the idea that you are going to search and hope to find answers to the question of origins already contains many assumptions that are not explained by materialism.   Now, nobody stops you from looking for answers -- you can use your free will [good luck explaining that with materialism] to go search for ""truth"", but what I'm saying is that the theory that you assume to be true (everything is purposeless matter) does not explain why you went on that search in the first place. You really don't see any irony here?  As long that you maintain philosophical materialism to be true, the very origin of your search for origins will remain out of reach.  edit: spacing"

religion,3b5838,pele-messi-goats,1 point,Fri Jun 26 01:56:13 2015 UTC,"In some Vedic schools (Vaishnavism) the difference between the ""gods"" (called deva) and God is not seen as some sort of mutual exclusivism. They both are purported to exist, and have different roles. Specifically, God and his forms (Vishnu, Shiva, Shakti, Narayana) are in one category of Godness (like the Father and the Holy Ghost are supposed to be both God in Christianity), whereas the ""gods"" (which are similar in description with the Christian angels) are limited in power and scope of vision. Here is a description of this from a book on this:  ""Vedic descriptions about the nature of God end with Ká¹£Ä«rodakaÅÄyÄ« Viá¹£nu who represents all possibilities. Beginning with Åiva, there are many possible subsets of this entire set of possibilities. Thus, while Åiva experiences everything manifest within the universe at any one time, the Vedas also describe the presence of demigods (called deva) who experience smaller subsets of the cosmic experience at once.While they cannot experience opposites at the same time, they can, however, experience semantically similar types of information across many instances or objects. For instance, while you and I can experience some wealth, we cannot claim to experience all the wealth in the world; that is said to be the experience of a demigod called Kubera. Similarly, while you and I can have some amount of love, we cannot claim to enjoy all the love in the universe; that is said to be enjoyed by a demigod called Kamadeva.  These demigods have a much broader experience than us, but their experience is a much smaller subset of the experiences in Åiva which is further a small subset of possibilities in Ká¹£Ä«rodakaÅÄyÄ« Viá¹£nu and so forth. Relative to our experiences, the demigodâs experience is much broader. But relative to Godâs experience, the demigod experience is a pittance. Nevertheless, for those living beings whose thinking hasnât developed sufficiently enough to understand the nature of God, the Vedas prescribe understanding of these smaller parts of the cosmic experience. In that sense, Vedic knowledge includes not just the transcendental aspects, but also many mundane aspects of our life. Thus there is Ayurveda (the science of health), Gandharva-veda (the science of music) and VÄstu-shÄstra (the science of architecture). The Vedas also provide descriptions of rituals and practices by which a living being can obtain increased amounts of love, money, health, music, property and other kinds of material objects in the universe. All of these together form apara-vidya or inferior knowledge as compared to knowledge about God Himself which is called para-vidya or transcendental knowledge. While the knowledge related to health, music, wealth and architecture is more tangible in terms of what we know today, this is not the core and ultimate purpose of Vedic philosophy.""

religion,3b10wj,KrankyKraut,4,Thu Jun 25 16:18:29 2015 UTC,"Muhammad:   'Whoever changed his Islamic religion, then kill him.'   Islamic schools of jurisprudence (sharia):   Hanafi â views blasphemy as synonymous with apostasy.  If a non-Muslim commits blasphemy, his punishment must be a tazir (discretionary, can be death, arrest, caning, etc.)  Maliki â view blasphemy as an offense distinct from, and more severe than apostasy. A non-Muslim who commits blasphemy against Islam must be punished; however, the blasphemer can escape punishment by converting and becoming a devout Muslim  Hanbali â view blasphemy as an offense distinct from, and more severe than apostasy. Death is mandatory in cases of blasphemy  Shafiâi â recognizes blasphemy as a separate offense from apostasy, but accepts the repentance of blasphemers. If the blasphemer does not repent, the punishment is death  Ja'fari (Shia) â views blasphemy against Islam, the Prophet, or any of the Imams, to be punishable with death, if the blasphemer is a Muslim.[99] In case the blasphemer is a non-Muslim, he is given a chance to convert to Islam, or else killed   Also interesting is the attitude towards non-Muslims, basically a master race vs. subhumans attitude, promoted by Islam:   Hanafi and Maliki fiqh also consider the life of a Christian or Jew to be worth half a Muslim's life,[2] but Shafi'i schools of jurisprudence consider it to be worth a third that of a Muslim.   The legal schools of Hanafi, Maliki and Shafi'i Sunni Islam as well as those of Shia Islam have considered the life of polytheists and atheists as one-fifteenth the value of a Muslim   To me, Muhammad was basically a 7th century Hitler, and the book he created is full of poison for the soul. The barbarian totalitarian ideology of Muhammad is reflected in sharia and the behaviour of a huge amount of Muslims. For instance 1/3 of Muslims worldwide support death penalthy for leaving Islam. Without this ideology they could be good people, but the ideology has imprisoned and poisoned their soul and their countries.   The attitude transported by Quran is the opposite of spirituality. It makes it impossible to grow spiritually. Because to grow spiritually, you must use your brain, not turn it off and let a book do the thinking for you.  While Christianity isn't much better, at least their role model isn't a psychopathic killer who hates unbelievers (hate is the biggest spiritual impurity), they generally don't take the bullshit in the Old Testament serious, and there are only few orders to commit political violence.   I said it before, and I say it again: If your religion reduces empathy for humanity (e.g. for homosexuals) instead of increasing empathy, then it lost its justification for existence. The world would be a better place without it. Islam is one of the more severe cases in this regard, if not the most severe case (not counting the Maya religion).

Follow whom you wish, you have the free will and the brains to choose, your choices will have consequences on yourself so choose carefully and you only have yourself to blame as you have been warned time and time and time again, this path of yours you are taking is leading you to one bad place you have no way of escaping. The curse is on you until you repent.  As for me, I will follow the wishes of my Creator whom I am grateful for the guidance He has given me, for the things he has bestowed upon me and I ask Him for living a happy life in heaven when I meet Him.  I will end this by the words of Abraham PBUH as Allah has told us in the Quran (Translated).  26:78 Who created me, and He [it is who] guides me.  26:79 And it is He who feeds me and gives me drink.  26:80 And when I am ill, it is He who cures me  26:81 And who will cause me to die and then bring me to life  26:82 And who I aspire that He will forgive me my sin on the Day of Recompense.""  26:83 [And he said], ""My Lord, grant me authority and join me with the righteous.  26:84 And grant me a reputation of honor among later generations.  26:85 And place me among the inheritors of the Garden of Pleasure.  26:86 And forgive my father. Indeed, he has been of those astray.  26:87 And do not disgrace me on the Day they are [all] resurrected -  26:88 The Day when there will not benefit [anyone] wealth or children  26:89 But only one who comes to Allah with a sound heart."""

This means Islam has many enemies, willing to lie and hide parts of the truth, this is not helped by many Muslims who don't know their religion and mix it with culture.   In addition, there are groups of Muslims who think they can establish what they think Islam should be by force. Again, another type of misguidance.

religion,3ayv6o,_Quadro,6,Wed Jun 24 16:35:15 2015 UTC,"Hi _Quadro!  Religion, as with most things in life, is a subjective experience.  For me, it's a lens through which I see the world, and I use it because it makes the world more ""true""--and not just ""true"" in the scientific sense, but also in the sense of a placebo.  Believing in a God who loves  is like having someone tell you that they love you every day--eventually your face starts glowing.  In addition to love, religion also addresses suffering.  I can go into details if prompted.  That said, most of what I believe about the spiritual reality is addressed in Emerson's Oversoul essay.  Peace be with you!"
religion,3ayv6o,frychu,3,Wed Jun 24 16:46:17 2015 UTC,"Will definitely read that. Thanks!   But yeah, what do you mean by adressing the suffering? Like for instance when someone dies you can say: ""it's fine, he went to heaven?"" or ""It's Gods plan?""  I hope I don't misunderstand you, and DO correct me if I'm wrong. But if I'm reading between the lines here, I sense that you might 'know' that your faith is false(in the lightest sense, not the greatest vocabulary )but you like the idea of your religion too much to let it go.   Again, correct me if I'm wrong.   Thanks again"
religion,3ayv6o,frychu,4,Wed Jun 24 17:03:04 2015 UTC,"In terms of suffering, it's again based a certain perspective.  One cannot grow without suffering, and growth is typically painful.  I embrace suffering just as I embrace reality--sometimes it sucks, but it's authentic; it forces me to recognize my existence.  Underlying these overt observations are beliefs in Jesus and the nature of humanity, but again, I won't delve into the details unless you really want to know the roots.  Heh, I know a lot of people just want to be right--I don't really care if I'm right or not.  After all, ""what is truth"" anyway?  But I definitely want to love.  I can't describe it well, and I wasn't always like this, but there's something in me that compels me to love everyone.  I call it ""God"" but that's semantics.  That said, I reject superficial beliefs in God (e.g. God as a genie).  If I were to describe God, I would use words like, energy, flow, resonance, connection, and collective consciousness.  It's not so much that I can't let go of these ideas; it's more like, as a result of my assumptions about the universe, I make some interesting observations (subject to confirmation bias, of course, but that's what makes it fun, because they serve as talking/connection points with people)."

I'm really curious how that life is like you know. Not that I'm missing social contact or anything, I don't think I'm missing out really.   And I've been reading up on this thing called closet-atheists and how they can really be in a bit of pickle sometimes when they are in a community where they sometimes don't know anyone that is a non-believer.

I'm actually in the process of exploring the different churches in my area.  I visit them, talk to the people there and get a sense of what people mean when they say they believe in ""God""--and it's unsurprisingly different for the different churches.  But again, I won't delve into details unless you're interested.  To address your question, when it comes to ""community,"" I've recently been thinking about the concept of ""belonging"" and ""fit.""  As I was growing up, I was someone who could pretend and fit any mold; I could belong anywhere.  But over time, I got tired of it and I had to figure out my own identity.  Thus I'm not so caught up in finding a community.  Instead, life's a journey, and I don't know where you've been or where you'll be going, but it sounds like you've been attuned to something more than the physical reality.  Pursue it, friend!  Hypothesize crazy things about the universe (if you're into that sort of thing) and test them!  Don't be confined to what other people believe/experience; seek to experience the fullness of reality, for that is where God dwells.  Did you read The Oversoul yet? :P"

religion,3ayv6o,Archaeoculus,3,Thu Jun 25 19:10:32 2015 UTC,"For some background, I am a polytheistic eclectic pagan, practicing earth worship and the worship of deities from different pantheons.   I'm going to try to take a risky position here. Religious fulfillment isn't so different from passion for science, at an emotional level. Bear with me.  I love science. When I stand in an empty field and gaze up at the stars, I am filled with wonder and awe at the beauty of the universe, at the infinitesimally small probability that I may be standing here, right now, gazing up as I am. By my existence, I am both huge and tiny. I am a part of the vast universe, perceiving itself. There are so many mysteries, and so much beauty, and so much suffering and pain too, but it is all huge and awe-inspiring.  What makes that religious for me (if not for others) is that I choose to believe there are things that fill those gaps and those mysteries. Now that may seem silly to you - why would I need to? But it's something that I like to do, that makes me feel good, and when I perform rituals or celebrate my faith, I can readily call back those feelings of awe and wonderment, can feel at one with the universe, with the divine.  I haven't sought community around that until very recently, frankly out of fear. Fear that others in the community wouldn't take it seriously. Fear that others wouldn't think I take it seriously, because my knowledge of traditions and orthodox practices is limited. When a community works, that sense of awe and wonder amplifies and multiplies. When it doesn't, well...it can feel very unharmonious and upsetting indeed.  A lot of people treat religion as a chore, but for me it's very real and alive. I hope that gives some insight.  Edit: Spelling"
religion,3ayv6o,Archaeoculus,3,Wed Jun 24 22:23:31 2015 UTC,"There's a huge diversity of religious experience.  Christians going who go to church are only one segment of a worldwide religious population.  Baha'is have the following take on what religion is and what it means to be religious.  First, we believe the major world religious come from one God who has shared his message to humanity through prophets such as Moses, Christ, Mohammad, Baha'u'llah, the Buddha, Krishna, and others.  The core truths have always been the same, yet the details (laws, understanding of afterlife, etc) have varied with the understanding of the people in a religion's time and place.  To be religious means to be a follower of once of these Messengers.  This can take a variety of forms.  One aspect is inner and spiritual, where the believer has a love for a higher power.  Another is obedience, where the followers obey the request of God as delivered.  Religious communities are common, and often have a great deal of fellowship among themselves.  If you want to learn more, it's probably easiest to focus.  Perhaps you're interested in learning about an Abrahamic religion?  You can probably find some believers in person or visit the sub for a specific religion."

But what is your belief on an afterlife based on? I myself have a really hard time understanding how people reach specific beliefs in the supernatural.

religion,3axhym,sisko7,0,Wed Jun 24 13:27:43 2015 UTC,"A warlord   An unfair assessment. Unless I am mistaken, the wars during his lifetime were with the Quraysh who were most certainly the aggressors.  Muhammad spent a long time preaching non-violently in Mecca, facing a great many abuses from the ruling authorities. He only left the city, and thus this non-violent pattern, due to an attempt on his life.  When I see people talk about Muhammad in this manner, in the context of war, I can't help but wonder who exactly they imagine he was fighting.  You'd almost think people believe he was fighting against a nation of puppies and kittens. The way they talk about that part of the history of Islam.    and demanded 20% of the war booty   Much of which was donated to The Emigrants. What with their essentially being homeless.   A person who had sex with a 9 year old child   I can't deny this. I can't really defend against this.  I can say the images of Muhammad as some drooling pedophile are misplaced.   His first and, if I am not mistaken, most beloved wife Khadija, was 15 years his elder. 40 years old, when he married her at 25.  I'll also point out that that was only slightly short of the norm at the time. Had a period? Then yer ready fer marriage, girlie.   Now, I can't really argue the morality of it in a broader, abstract sense where we consider modern morality against claims of Muhammad's eternal, universal morality and status as most upright man there ever was.  I can however, say the way that people depict him are most certainly unfair."

Maybe I'm a little biased since now I'm orthodox, but here's my two cents none the less:  It wasn't confusing to me. We celebrated bastardized versions of both holidays, but our parents made it very clear to us that both were basically fiction (from their perspective).  What had become increasingly frustrating as I've gotten older and more religious is that my father, no matter how kind or welcoming the community, does not feel like he belongs. And what I had to come to terms with after a while, was that he doesn't belong. No one has ever insinuated this or made him feel unwanted, on the contrary my community very much supports and loves me and therefore wants to make my parents as comfortable as possible. But the truth is, my dad doesn't feel the same connection to other Jews that my mom and I do. Because we're Jewish, and he's not. And the closer I get to my community, to a place that I feel is undeniably home, the harder I have to work at maintaining even the same level of connection with my dad. Like...walking up a down escalator.  I know that wasn't really the answer you were expecting, but it's the first thing that came to mind.  EDIT: Oh, I thought this was in r/Judaism.

The crux of Judaism is basically monotheism. You're going to teach your kids the shema but also that there are multiple gods? Unless your definition of a Jewish identity is sometimes remembering to light Chanukkah candles and throwing them a party for their thirteenth birthday, in which case . . . I don't think you'll meet much resistance."

They also have personal issues that made them not the best parents, but my sisters were raised by our loving Christian nanny and we turned out okay. I'm a Christian and my two sisters are staunch atheists.   Here's what my parents did wrong:     1) My mother made us pray for our father's soul because she was convinced that he was going to hell. My father made us believe that our mother was crazy.     2) My parents had different sets of morals: my mother disowned our cousin who got pregnant before marriage and forbade us to speak to her ever again, and my father told us that if we were to get pregnant before marriage we needed to get an abortion and not tell our mother. Neither of them knew that we (me and my sisters) had the separate talks.      3) They shamed their kids for choosing different beliefs. My mother practically beat up one of my sisters for saying she was an atheist and my father slapped me for wanting to be a missionary and was/still is a massive asshole about it even though I don't want to be a missionary anymore.    4) They went through different periods of being heavily involved in religious communities to not at all. To this day it's hard to take their faiths seriously because they've never shown a commitment to one particular community and never had friends from Church.   So I would say this. Have ""serious"" talks about abortion, sex, drugs, etc, as a family and you can talk about how your faith shapes the way that you think about those things. Also be clear about what are matters of opinion and what are rules, and always give reasons for your rules, and if your faith makes you a little more or a little less strict, then say so. Be committed to your communities if you want your child to learn from them, and don't make your child chose until he/she wants to. Don't initiate them into either or even both communities as a child because he/she may come to regret it later on in life. Join an interfaith community (whether its a religious or academic center) so that your children will have firsthand experiences of what it means to be multifaith."

religion,3arlba,IrreverentPriest,2,Tue Jun 23 04:54:42 2015 UTC,"So she's an eclectic Wiccan.  What will likely help you both is the emphasis on any children's faith coming about through exploration. You both have practices and holidays you celebrate, but to the best of my knowledge, there is nothing expressly in Judaism that says you can't celebrate the holidays of other faiths.  Your SO will be a billion times more happy if you both emphasize learning and exploration for your potential children when it comes to religion. People who are eclectics fall into one of two camps, the ""I'm just looking around and taking a grab bag of everything to see what works"" sort, and the ""I am called to multiple cultures and feel a strong bond to more than one of them and will honor them accordingly"".  Another thing that might help here is the both of your stances on the divine. If she is Wiccan (opposed to Wicca-influenced), that means she believes in the Goddess (and possibly the God as well, whether or not they're equal is another story). If she is of the duality sort, she may just want your children to learn that the God in Wicca is actually the Jewish G-d. Yes, I have seen this arrangement before. I've also seen similar for Wiccans married to Catholics where it's actually a Christo-Wicca / Catho-Wicca, where you have Mary and God being the Goddess and God.  It's totally doable, point being. Just emphasize learning and letting your kid find their way on their own. However, as a Pagan, I will say this: if you went to Hebrew school, also send your kid to Hebrew school. Being Jewish is more than being a faith, it's also being part of a culture, and there is nothing wrong for them to find themselves part of the Jewish culture, even if it is not one your SO herself subscribes to.  Good luck on the talks of circumcision though, which is something you two should discuss. Also if there will be any bar/bat mitzvahs."

In mathematics, we have notions of ""proof"", but at the same time, different mathematicians will demand different standards of rigor depending on what makes them confident something is true.  Religion is an informed choice for me.  I don't accept it without evidence.  From my perspective its validity is proven (and note -- this does not imply that other religions or secular philosophies are wrong)."
religion,3ajqdp,bchurchill,2,Sat Jun 20 22:26:58 2015 UTC,What evidence has been helpful for you?
religion,3ajqdp,bchurchill,3,Mon Jun 22 05:22:45 2015 UTC,"To me, the writings and history of Baha'i Faith are the strongest evidence.    We interact with the writings on multiple levels.  One is intuition; when I read the writings, they make sense to me.  They don't contradict themselves and agree with what I know.  Another is emotional; the writings often resonate with me, and they evoke feelings of awe, humility, sincerity, hope, love, enthusiasm, joy, acceptance, gratitude, and probably several others.  Another is intellectual; the more I systematically research questions, and study the text in a more academic way, the more certain I become of their validity.  There are probably other modes in which we work with them too, but these are the ones that come to mind.  BahÃ¡'Ã­s believe that God has sent messengers of God -- such as Zoaraster, Moses, Christ, Mohammad, BahÃ¡'u'llah and others (including Dharamic ones too, like Krishna and Gautama Buddha).  The greatest evidence of God are these individuals, which is why history is important.  All of these messengers have suffered in their lives, usually at the hands of their contemporaries, and sacrificed themselves, that mankind may be freed from its sorrows.  Through their manifold sacrifices, they have taught the world how to live.  There's a core truth to these religions that's timeless about how to live virtuously, and this is one demonstration of the underlying unity of the prophets and of God.  Yet, the way we approach God varies tremendously.  I've heard it said that there are as many ways to know God as there are people.  For example, the deists find God self-evident in the universe, and they don't even need a prophet to convince them!  (Which is odd to me, because I don't think I would be convinced without religious writings)"

So long as they're not actively lying about their work (which happens sometimes), the procedures they follow to get to truth are fairly reliable.  Unfortunately, religions don't have universally-accepted standards to ascertain truth about God.  Different denominations may have a different interpretation of a holy writing, or differ on who is allowed to authoritatively interpret them.  That, and the fact that some ""religions"" are just made up by their ""founders"" for political or economic reasons.

My religious beliefs are perfectly rational, just as rational as choosing a doctor. A Person claimed to be a Messenger from God; I examined His Writings, Teachings, and life, and found His Teachings were so extraordinary that they are beyond what can be produced by even our savants, and considering His historical and life context, they were absolutely mind-blowingly sophisticated. Furthermore, He even fit with Prophecy from older traditions. What would be irrational about accepting His claim?  Now, I'm a Baha'i, and this is my evaluation of Baha'u'llah, but that faith procedure I just described is very rational and could apply to any of the major religions. A couple hundred years after the advent of God's Messenger some of His Writings fall into your hands, you read them, and you are like ""WHOAH"".

religion,3ajqdp,p0sternutbag,1 point,Mon Jun 22 05:26:10 2015 UTC,"To really get down to the real issue here...we need to start at the beginning.  And the beginning is what we know as the moment of the creation of the universe...the ""Big Bang"".  It's generally accepted that the universe is not eternal, and hasn't always existed.  The estimated age of the universe is normally put at around 14 billion years old, give or take a few years.    So if we accept all that, that the universe has existed for a finite amount of time, I get to the question I most often ask atheists:  Is it really easier to wrap your head around the universe happening all on it's own, than it is to believe there was intelligent design behind it?  For me, the ""proof"" of God...or at least a ""creator""...is all around us.  It's far more difficult, IMO, to wrap my head around the notion that everything in the cosmos all the way down to life itself, is nothing more than pure chance, and that all if it exists for no real purpose or reason.    I can certainly understand that religion...in all it's forms, faiths, denominations, doctrine, etc. can be very confusing, and even conflicting, to someone outside of religion like yourself.  And even more confusing to think about a Creator (where did God come from?) and an afterlife like in Heaven, etc.  And how God knows all and sees all.  It's a big step from accepting that some divine intelligence created the universe to delving into various religious doctrine and belief.     That's another topic tho.  And consider as well, the ""Big Bang"" had to go off with an almost unimaginable precision...it had roughly a one in a quintillion chance of going off just right, eventually resulting in the formations of stars, planets, galaxies, etc. that we see today.  Just one tiny change in the way the ""Big Bang"" went off, and the universe would have been a complete mess...no celestial bodies forming, no stars, no planets, no galaxies.  And no life.    Is it possible that the ""Big Bang"" went off with such a high level of perfection?  Yes.  But it's not even remotely probable.  Just that alone is, for me, proof of intelligent design."

religion,3ahtif,YourMotherIsAPore,3,Sat Jun 20 14:40:44 2015 UTC,"There's some conflicting thought amongst Catholics on the notion that animals...especially our beloved pets...will be reunited with us in Heaven.  I like to think if Heaven really is the ultimate ""best place ever"", I'll see my pets there.  But that may not be the case.  Catholics consider that every living thing, humans and animals and even plants, have a soul.  This is based on the belief that a soul is the very ""essence"" of the living thing.  And all living things eventually die.  We consider death to be the moment when the soul (or ""essence"") of a living thing is separated from it's physical being.   Human souls are, however, very different than the souls of all other life forms.  Our souls are eternal...whereas all others are not.  We are guided by conscious and morals...all others are not.  And for much of our lives, we're aware of our own mortality.   Roman Catholic doctrine states that animals should never be abused...that animal cruelty violates man's dignity.  On the other hand, The Church accepts non-cruel animal experiments for the greater good, that animals may be used as ""tools"" (beasts of burden such as horses, mules, pack dogs, etc.), and animals may be used for food.  (Source:  CCC 2415-2418)   tl;dr Only human souls are eternal, therefore only human souls go to Heaven."

""What is referred to as M-theory [membrane theory] isn't even a theory. It's a collection of ideas, hopes, aspirations...It's not an uncommon thing in popular descriptions of science to latch onto some idea, particularly things to do with string theory, which have absolutely no support from observations... Yes, they are hardly science.""  Or Peter Woit...  ""Remarkably, the lack of any progress in achieving a predictive version of the theory that could be tested by experiment did not lead to theorists giving up on the superstring idea. Instead, it achieved sort of a critical mass, as a whole new research field grew up, largely disconnected from the rest of physics. The great complexity and poorly  understood nature of superstring theory provided many topics for theorists to work on, while at the same time avoiding any possibility of showing that the idea was wrong""  It's now at least 50 plus years later and string theory is still sitting there as the great hope. The theory is not proven and according to two books, has little if any chance of ever being proven. It has made no predictions that can be validated, unlike most accepted theories...  Here's another one from Craig Hogan, director of the Fermilab Center for particle Physics...  ""Einstein invented the theory of general relativity by sitting at his desk and working out the mathematics from first principles. There were few experimental quandaries that it solved -- indeed, it's first real experimental test would not come for years. Quantum mechanics, on the other hand, was imposed on the theorists by the puzzling results of the experiments. No theorists in his right mind would have invented quantum mechanics unless forced to by data. Yet it has become the most successful theory in the history of science.   In the same way theorists have for many years been building beautiful theories such as string theory, although it remains unclear if it can ever be tested""  That is what the article is referring to - it's not science if you can't test it. It becomes faith, hope and because of that you CAN call it scientism but nothing more. Obviously a hard thing to admit."

Until I read a series of books from scientist about their belief in God.  HERE is an example and one of the main reason I changed my mind.  If you don't want to read the whole thing, look at Table 14.1.  And HERE is even a more complete list including the fine tuning of Earth.  Point being is that these condition mean that for this to all occur by chance is 1 in a trillion trillion trillion trillions. In other words, the chance that this all happened by chance is mathematically impossible to have occurred in the lifespan of the universe. Therefore chance could not have had a play in how the universe came to the state it is in to support life. It had to be designed.   Astrophysics and Quantum Mechanics has shown disturbing conditions that remove the possibility of chance from the creation of the universe to a point where the mechanics of the universe are fine tuned to within 10120.  There is no mathematical possibility that this is anything but a Designer.   Now for a bigger questions: What or Who is God?  Honestly I think Heisenberg answered this question with his Uncertainty Principle: Although Quantum Mechanics shows that at least 10 dimensions of space and time have to exist, we as humans living in 3 dimensions of that space time can never observe anything beyond our constraints of space and time without the measurements becoming so error prone to be meaningless.    In other words, we as human can never understand the true nature of what God is and therefore are left with faith as the only explanation: God is what God is and that is all we will ever understand until such time we can leave the confines of our body and travel in hyper-dimensions. To bring faith back into this, you could say this is where our soul exists and once released from our body can now obtain the understanding of God as we become hyper-dimensional.   Having said all this, I am a Deist. I believe that Religion is a man made construct that has destroyed the true understanding of God and our universe. It is typically more interested in the preservation of its Dogma than what God means to us and our world."

The odds that the ""Big Bang"" would result in an ordered universe where stars, planets, galaxies, and life itself could form were one in a quintillion.  For comparison, there are about a quintillion grains of sand on the world's beaches.    All it would take for the ""Big Bang"" to have resulted in a massive cosmic mess, would have been to remove just one grain of sand.  Is it theoretically possible that the ""Big Bang"" went off with that level of precision by chance?  Sure.  But the probability of that happening is extremely remote, at best."
religion,3aa1k1,jetboyterp,1 point,Thu Jun 18 17:10:56 2015 UTC,"possible that the ""Big Bang"" went off with that level of precision by chance?   What is at issue is the timescale.  The universe is roughly 13 Billion years old and the mathematical chance that the universe was created by chance cannot have occurred within the timeframe of the universe. So its a mathematically impossibility. Could it happen? yes, just not in this universe, which is why the idea of the multi-verse has come about because it gives the denier the time it takes for chance to have worked. However, the physicist now say that current understanding of quantum mechanics makes the multi-verse theory very, if not completely unlikely. So you are back to the Designer again."

religion,3aa1k1,findmypenis,1 point,Thu Jun 18 14:51:00 2015 UTC,Well I would start with books from Dr. Huge Ross PHD.  That is what got me to think.  Then you can check out a number of the scientific papers that have been published through the Discovery Institute.  there are a number of these symposiums and conferences over the years that reference 100's of studies and papers.   My belief is centered more around the laws of nature in astrophysics but there are a few papers here by authors that are trying to discredit some portions of evolution. Although I agree that not all things are known when it comes to evolution - like the fact that RNA doesn't evolve without guidance - I firmly believe that evolution is a natural process of the world when it comes to the development of life.  So just be aware about some of the papers.

You believe you can hear His voice or sense His presence. After a lengthy process of observation and deliberation about your inner self and the observable universe, you have come to the conclusion that God must exist. You believe in God because of what other people have told you.   I suspect that most people believe in God because of reason number three. Although it's possible that reason number one is close.  edit: If I had to pick, I'd say I believed in God because of reason #2. I respect those who believe for one of the first two reasons... number 3, not so much.   I'd also imagine that, if you changed these to their negative versions, the same three reasons would explain the belief of most atheists as well.

So why not revere it as a deity, something you can actually see, something you are a part of, instead of a fictional character from an ancient book.  And before you tell anything, universe is eternal in a sense that it wasn't created by the big bang, the big bang was an event that took place in it. Before the big bang, there was something for sure. And I know you can say that the universe has a final volume, but it has no borders, that's why I think it should be considered infinite.

religion,3aa1k1,Uzbek_X,1 point,Thu Jun 18 19:01:44 2015 UTC,"Well, personally, I don't believe in ""belief in God"". You either know and experience or not, ""belief"" won't hold against the reality of your life for long.  What you probably meant to ask is that you want to know and experience God on the level described by others or by the scriptures, because what you personally know about Absolute Truth is nowhere near God yet, which is fine.   The point to remember is that there's nothing but the Absolute Truth, we only experience some aspects of it according to our realization. Someone here talked about Cosmos, for example, someone might say that above the universe there's Love. Some might say that Absolute Truth is getting high, some might say sex is the ultimate, some might say it's the money, and some might say that power is higher than money. In Hinduism you must have heard of five koshas - annamaya, pranamaya etc.   You seem to realize that relationship with God (anandamaya) probably trumps them all but can't reach that level of realization yet. Okay. Have you tried praying? The Holy Name is non-different from God Himself and it will reciprocate. It's right there in the Bhagavad Gita: ""I reward everyone accordingly"", and also ""I will give intelligence to those who sincerely want to find me"".  That's all you have to believe - that if you follow instructions given by Krishna they will bring results. If you pick up any other tradition it will work in the same way, too.   The steps are natural, you really don't have to go out of your way.  First shraddha, faith that it will work, then God will arrange for association with ""saintly persons"", then you'll start practicing yourself, and so it gradually develops.   Interestingly, if you choose to pursue a career you will have to go through the same motions, too."

And God did not make you donate to charity. You made yourself do both of those things. We alone make the decisions that will shape our futures. Not God. Not the devil.

Passover  Feast of Unleavened Bread  First Fruits  Shavuot  Yom Teruah  Yom Kippur  Sukkot   The Feast Days appointed by the Creator are for ALL of HIS children, not Jewish/Judaism. Exodus 12:38 clearly explains the exodus of mixed multitude.       HIS children are to celebrate the New Moon and the beginning of each month (""Rosh Chodesh""), as to celebrate the Sabbath and the Biblical Feasts: 1 Samuel 20: 18, 1 Chronicles 23: 31, Ezra 3: 5, Nehemiah 10: 33, Psalms 81: 3, Isaiah 66: 23, Ezekiel 45: 17, Ezekiel 46: 1- 6. (to name several).  The Messiah did not abolish the Fathers commands.  Otherwise, he clearly could not be the Messiah-going against the Father-who clearly does not change.  The reckoning of the Appointed Feats governed when Yahshua went up to Jerusalem to fulfill the Spring Feasts of the LORD.  The Fall Feasts are a future fulfillment in the fifth Gospel: the book of the Revelation.     Both Jews and Christians have forsaken the Creator's calendar for an invented reckoning of time. The modern Jewish calendar was invented in Tiberias in 359 of the Common Error, utilizing Babylon astronomy to calculate a complete new reckoning of time. The modern Christian calendar invented in Babylon nearly 4,000 years ago, remains just as pagan as the day it was fabricated.  Once we do our best to understand HIS time clock, the reasons behind why biblical events happened when they did, what was going on at that moment, and what it means in the big, prophetic picture -scales begin to fall off.

Your hypothesis can still work: one area can be more active than the other, and the odds of them being exactly equal in activity are low, but possible.   thanksgiving   I will stop the discussion on that point since I'm not advocating for thanking god for material wealth on thanksgiving.  back to my original comment and OP's comment. what /u/tatmom described is not necessarily resentment of neighbors who got their homes destroyed, but apathy, simply focusing on your good fortune while simply ignoring others' misfortune. this apathy does not carry negative energy and your comment on resentment does not necessarily apply here (I was accepting that it is resentment for the sake of argument)."

In short, I'm not sure if emotions are simply a superposition of physiological states (e.g. summing fMRI activity to demonstrate conflicting emotions).  But changing the focus from ""gratitude and resentment"" to ""multiple emotions"" is a sort of strawman.  Emotions are clearly multi-dimensional, and in this emotion-space, I hypothesize that gratitude and resentment are along the same axis in opposing directions.

religion,3a7iwx,bchurchill,3,Sat Jun 20 18:59:02 2015 UTC,"In the BahÃ¡'Ã­ Faith, difficult calamities or tests are something that bring us closer to God.  They make us humble, and realize that the world we live in is a passing one.  Soon, our short days on this planet will end, and we will enter the great unknown.  Baha'is believe that our lives in the next world depend more on the virtues that we learn in this world -- such as kindness, honesty, justice, trustworthiness, humility, patience, etc.  Tests such as these help us refine and polish ourselves, to teach us to worship and be trusting of God, and to develop these virtues.  So, regardless of the situation, whether our property survives or doesn't, we thank God and place our trust in Him, as only He knows what is best for us.   To summarize, this is a quote from our writings,   ""O Son of Man!  My calamity is My providence, outwardly it is fire and vengeance, but inwardly it is light and mercy.  Hasten thereunto that thou mayest become an eternal light and an immortal spirit.  This is My command unto thee, do thou observe it.""

My only answer is that everyone has their own path in life. being thankful for what you have can keep you humble and help you to realize that you are fortunate and should help others who are not as fortunate. If something bad happened to me and my neighbor was not even thankful that they were spared, it would make me feel worse like they don't even appreciate what they have. I don't think God causes bad things to happen to certain people, our world is full of random acts of nature, evil, free will, chance etc. the most we can do it thank God for putting us in the position for the good things, and ask for help in the bad. He can make a good thing come out of any bad situation, but only if you take His guidance. If your house burns down, all may seem lost.

For starters, they gave us three numbers -- the total people surveyed, the number that were Protestant, and the number that were Catholic -- from which we can math the ""everyone else"" category.  1,527 random people were surveyed from across the US. All those surveyed fell into one of three groups:   Protestant (including non-denomination Christians): 796 Catholic: 309 Everyone else: 422   Everyone else includes people such as:   agnostics atheists Pagans Hindus Jews Muslims Sikhs Jains   and many more.  If the question asked was, ""What is your level of confidence in organized religion?"" you can expect poor results from agnostics, atheists, and even Pagans. If the question was ""What is your level of confidence in the Church?"" people would likely assume that 'the Church' is the Catholic church, and you would see a far lower rating across the board because they are not Catholic.  As a result, this survey does not express confidence in religion as a whole, but specifically in either Christian religions or organized religion.  A more telling question would have been a random sample of 500 from every state including the District of Columbia (read: 25,500 participants) asking how they religiously identify themselves, how confident they feel in their beliefs, and how strictly they adhere to their beliefs. And then, instead of clumping everyone together, release all the results categorized by each religion.

The slaves were converted and so they wouldn't abandon their faith just because of a few verses that tell slaves to obey and not run away.  Just like there are lots of openly gay Christians despite the few verses that condemn homosexuality.  They still identify with their religion despite the contradiction.

One can take a cursory glance at Christianity, for example, and say, ""Hmm, some guy got hung from a cross and now we're all free."" but there's always more.  I personally looked through most of the popular religions, as those are usually the most logical, and read a wikipedia page on them until I discovered Baha'i, which pretty much fit what I already believed to a T."
religion,39onan,sisko7,2,Sat Jun 13 11:01:15 2015 UTC,"My beliefs are based on spiritual experience, not on other religions. Though I see my beliefs reflected in some aspects of various religions and philosophies (including Bahai). At the same time I reject lots of aspects of these religions. There is no religion which would 100% fit my beliefs. I especially reject the idea of a personal God with human characteristics (ego, anger, punishment, etc.). The divine I experienced is nothing like that. The first religion I rejected was the one I was born into, Christianity, and I made it official at the age of 14. Subsequently I was an atheist for many years.   I do agree that you have to set yourself free from indoctrinated beliefs, and that you should search spiritual insight for yourself. If you desire to search anyway. Otherwise your beliefs are just a relict of ancient times, and a result of being born into a certain family in a certain country. And usually it's pretty much a dead religion, as it doesn't evolve. So your beliefs are like a dead fish, drifting with the stream. I believe that being an atheist for all your life is perfectly fine. Atheism does not make you a bad person, and it certainly doesn't make some hyper-intelligent divine force angry and want to torture you in hell. On the contrary, certain ancient beliefs may make you a bad person, and make your own life and the life of others hell."

Not solely on that, mind, because I had shit to do in the meantime. But It was something I would spend my free time on, and I would purposefully seek out media and literature that would challenge me, because I did not want to be caught in an echo chamber that would just reinforce my preconceived notions.  I was raised Presbyterian, and went to an Episcopal elementary school. I went to numerous pujas with my closest friend on the planet, who was and is Hindu. I spent time with Messianic Judaism until I learned their unsavory backhistory and current motivations. I spent time with Wiccans and Quakers. I read about modern polytheism.  And with that, a truly polytheist spiritual outlook answered many lingering and unsatisfactorily explained questions monotheism and atheism left me with. So yes, I put the work into it. I did the reading, and the in-person experiences.   And I found monotheism of any variety severely wanting and hollow."

While I didnât study faiths as much afterwards it remains an interest of mine.   Just recently,  (another 10 years after finding my path) I've had another major shift in my spirituality. I haven't abandoned the path I took ten years ago, but it looks different than it did then. I've added many outside influences, and technically follow two religions at this point (both are non-exclusive).  This may sound like I can't stick to something.

But faith in the Creater is felt more than rationalized.  Research simply is our quest to understand the nuts and bolts of something far greater than anything we ever experienced.  What religion each of us chooses is in direct context to our lifes summary of experiences tailored to each of us.  Once we feel something is right within us we relate to that view.  Feelings aren't something that can be explained.  In essence we all make decissions based on our individual need for understanding or direction.  All religions are a path to a higher level of understanding and our need to grow towards God..  Even baby steps get us closer to God and sometimes we make major leaps."

Mortal sin, on the other hand, allegedly severs one from God completely. Mortal sins can only be wiped away by going to confession.  There is actually a third category, called âgraveâ sins which are really bad mortal sins.   This is incorrect. There are only two categories. A ""grave sin"" is just an imprecise term for a mortal sin, which involves (1) grave matter, (2) full knowledge, and (3) full consent.   There is no other law than Godâs law, which needs no additions, embellishment, or interpretation.   And finally we get to punchline!

It's better to select some important passages, post them and invite a discussion. Just based on past experiences here.    For example, if I present the Baha'i explanation by Abdul-Baha (the son and authorised interpreter of Baha'u'llah, the messenger of God who brought the Baha'i faith), I'd provide the link for reference, but I'd present the key ideas. That way, it can invite a discussion in this thread AND allow for those interested to visit the link.    For the record...      Adam signifies the heavenly spirit of Adam, and Eve His human soul. For in some passages in the Holy Books where women are mentioned, they represent the soul of man. The tree of good and evil signifies the human world; for the spiritual and divine world is purely good and absolutely luminous, but in the human world light and darkness, good and evil, exist as opposite conditions.      Baha'is see the story of Adam and Eve as symbolic and representing the nature of man's soul and spirit. http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/ab/SAQ/saq-30.html"

I've been told that the colours of the scarves that they wrap around these hats can have some meaning too, white scarves meaning that they're students, red, green, or blue can signify a political or religious ideology that they follow, or could just be to keep their heads warm or to guard against the occasional dust storms; I dunno."

The idea that our universe follows a deterministic set of rules and that we are all doomed to our fate is nothing new.  It's hard, but not impossible, for a new metaphysical perpsective to be useful today.  My guess is it has to connect us somehow.  Perhaps it needs to connect us more deeply with oursleves, or with our friends/family/acquaintences/strangers.  Or, connect us to the nature of reality, God or a higher power.  Part of this, as you suggest, might be ethics, but it doesn't have to be that.  On a tangental note -- as a computer scientist, I can't stand the idea that the universe can be simulated with a turing machine.

religion,39feoj,CertifiedTrekkie,2,Thu Jun 11 16:45:02 2015 UTC,"In terms of Buddhism, what's considered a ""holy text"" differs between sects.  For traditionalist Theravada groups, only the Pali Canon is the valid ""word of the Buddha"" as it was passed down in oral fashion for centuries before being recorded.  It's an accurate re-telling of the historical Gotama Buddha's teachings, and has been preserved to the present day through the global sangha's efforts.    Mahayana, or esoteric Buddhism, draws upon a number of sutras in addition to the traditional text (which is still accepted as the teaching of the Buddha) whose teachings supersede the originals.  The Lotus Sutra is used as a basis for a number of traditions, so that might be a good place to start.  Each sect has its own base text, and they vary from the highly readable (Dogen's Shobogenzo, for example) to the incredibly repetitive (most of the Pali Canon.)   With the wide variety of Buddhist sects in the world and the enormous divergence of beliefs between each, it can be daunting where to start.  What the Buddha himself actually said, as was preserved in oral form by his earliest followers, is present in textual form but it will be an investment - it's in three volumes and they're all quite long."

religion,39gnv8,sisko7,3,Thu Jun 11 19:26:11 2015 UTC,"I'd rather call it ""divine formulas"" (e.g. Newton's Law) which are discovered by science. I tend to consider these formulas and fundamental constants of physics a divine program code. The program code which runs the universe and holds it together, and gets discovered by scientists.  Btw, do you know the Mandelbrot set? Some call it the ""thumbprint of God"". It's a rather simple mathematical formula which produces an amazing variety of shapes and objects, looking like art. Divine art, if you wish, because it's not created by man, but it is a result of simple maths. Sure, the formula was put together by man, and is visualized by a computer created by man, but it's more like man found the formula, and was amazed by what it does.  Of course this ""divine art"" existed long before science and maths. But only recently its existence has been discovered. If there are aliens who are into maths, they may find the same formula some day and get exactly the same patterns when they visualize it.

In fact I think the possibility of fractals is necessary for complex life to evolve from simple dead matter - see Rule 30.   Basically, the Mandelbrot set and DNA are based on similar principles. And to me there is something divine about it. Thus I call fractals divine art. Not to be confused with divine intervention though. Neither the Mandelbrot set nor DNA were a result of divine intervention (""creation""), but only a result of divine program code parameters.  But yea, it's possible that the fine-tuned biophilic parameters (fundamental constants of physics) of our universe are just a huge lucky coincidence inside a huge lucky coincidence (like winning the jackpot in a lottery 2 times in a row), or that we live in a multiverse with billions of universes whose program code doesn't make them biophilic.  Anyway, a belief to me is just a belief. It's not necessarily based on observable facts. Though in my case it's also based on spiritual experience (which I could have interpreted wrong). It's not real knowledge, like science. It can be wrong, it can be an illusion. It's just one possible answer to a question which can't yet be definitely answered by science."

religion,399vfz,Ronan-the-Accuser,19,Wed Jun 10 08:20:04 2015 UTC,"The only part of your argument I would like to point out is that the Mongols were very tolerant of religion, despite popular image of warmongering conquerors. Unless you aren't talking about the Mongol Empire under the Khans. I don't know where you got your information.  The Genghis Khan era Mongols were practitioners of Tengriism, a religion we have little knowledge about in modern times. However, Tengriism was tied to one's ancestors so the Mongols didn't really push anyone to worship their religion.  More on topic, I am currently living Burma where a lot of extremism occured very recently. As a cultural insider, I can safely say that much of this ""Buddhist"" violence is not fuelled by religious motives but rather other divides (i.e. ethnic conflict). Despite being a universalising religion, Buddism is not very pushy at converting (usually). Because of this, Buddhism has historically spread mainly by contagious diffusion- people here about it adapt themselves (and this is why there are so much variation among the denominations). Thus, the Buddhists here overlap almost exactly with ethnic lines. It's not like people are demanding that others convert of die here. They are simply killing them- usually without asking to convert.  And as someone else has mentioned, the Jain massacre has been discussed in /r/buddhism. The person doing the killing the Jains here is considered in Buddhism to be part of the ""5 enemies"" as he is a King. Thus, Theravada Buddhists would consider that he cannot really be free from sin (commanding criminals to a death sentence is considered ""killing"" by many).  As for that quote you provided, it is from a Mahayana text. As a Theravada/Early Buddhist, I respectfully dismiss this. It is not part of what my denominations believes to be an original and credible scripture. Moreover, we regard killing for mercy to be a sin. Ritual killing of animals to free them from their life into a better life is dismissed among my peers as a misguided ""animist"" practice. Thus, I consider mercy killing to be a sin."
religion,399vfz,EmeraldRange,3,Wed Jun 10 13:04:52 2015 UTC,"Another point about some of the Mongols is that they weren't really necessarily the Buddhist 'teachers', but ... passionate but perhaps somewhat uninformed students, perhaps.  There is a story about one of the Karmapas, who was the lama of one of the Khans.  This Khan offered to forcefully convert everyone to the Kagyu style of Buddhism (the Karmapa's school), but the Karmapa apparently declined and said something along the lines of ""No, please don't - there are different paths for different people because people need different things""."
religion,399vfz,ahoyhoyhey,3,Wed Jun 10 13:47:39 2015 UTC,Exactly. The Khans were known for allowing the people in the lands they captured to continue following their own religions and customs as long as they paid tribute to him and gave him soldiers to keep conquering new lands.

religion,399vfz,Theodore-Hunter,1 point,Sat Jul 4 13:06:06 2015 UTC,"Short answer:Killing is killing.  Long Answer: Every being is trapped in Samsara and therefore suffers to some degree- with those in higher realms of existence (e.g. Devas, ""gods"", etc.) experiencing less suffering than lower realms of existence (e.g. Hell, ghosts, animals, etc.).   If mercy killing is good, and every being suffers no matter what, then any killing of any being is mercy killing. To go a step further, after you have released the being of your choice from their suffering, they will simply end up in another realm, where they will suffer again.   Therefore, mercy killing is just killing. (of course, this relies on the concept of reincarnation which is a pretty important part of Buddhism)."

Likewise, mercy killing can end suffering for a while, but they don't last.  As for your second question, I frankly have no idea what good there is in letting a fatally wounded animal live longer.

Even if someone tears you limb by limb, you are not supposed to retaliate, or even let hatred arise in your heart. The message is consistent, without a single sutta saying otherwise.

I'm supposing that your motivation for posting this was to say ""look, we criticize Islam, but bad things have happened in the name of Buddhism too... why do we ignore that?""  Assuming that that was, generally, the background to the post, a few words: First of all, it may be true (certainly is) that there have been things done in the name of Buddhism, much like any other ideology.  But I'm not sure what point you're trying to make.  If you're saying that Buddhism is just as bad as other 'religions', then I don't think you made your point.  I think if we look at the history of Buddhism, as well as it's current manifestation, it by-and-large has been one of the most exemplary 'organized religions' around.  Which is not to say untainted by bad things, but overall it's been quite peaceful and positive.  If you look at Buddhism in today's world, it is basically the same - you can look at the situation in Burma with the Rohingya muslims there and find fault, surely, but other than that... can't really think of any major faults.  This is, of course, different than the 'extremist' Muslim problem, or even some of the 'extremist' Christian groups to a lesser extent.  These are active issues that are quite significant - and I don't meant to downplay Burma, but I'm just saying if you look at overall numbers and impact, they are not the same.  In short, you posted something that is meant to inflame, but I don't really know what your purpose was, nor do I know if you actually realized that purpose.

religion,399vfz,ahoyhoyhey,-3,Wed Jun 10 13:56:27 2015 UTC,"Actually, the situation in Burma makes Buddhism look even worse, IMO. With Muslim and Christian militancy, it's the lay Muslim and lay Christian that is the more extreme. But in Burma, the terrorists/extremists are the monks themselves, those that we would expect to be the most peaceful and the most learned of what Buddhism teaches. So if the learned monks are the ones calling for genocides, then it is only logical that the problem rests with the teachings of Buddhism and not some random poorly informed interpretation of Buddhist teachings."
religion,399vfz,Militant_Antitheist,3,Wed Jun 10 15:35:52 2015 UTC,"I respectfully disagree.  First of all, a monk is not necessarily a teacher or highly learned individual, it just means that for whatever reason - whether family pressures (which often happens), desire for education, religious inclinations, etc - they take vows and live a certain type of life - it doesn't even necessarily mean they keep those vows, particularly perhaps if their motivation is not the religious type.  I would also point out that there is a long history of monks and nuns in Buddhism, and I think that this example is the CLEAR outlier - it is by no means normal whatsoever for monks or nuns (or Buddhists in general) to be acting anywhere close to that.  Second, I disagree with your apparent assertion that it is the lay people of other religions that are the only problematic ones.  There are many imams/clerics that hold PhDs in Islamic studies, for example, and that are in positions of influence that are absolutely influential in extremists movements, even the most militant ones.  As far as Christian examples, frankly I only brought that up to not look like I was picking on Muslims (there are examples such as groups in Africa that are allegedly Christians that are pretty terrible, of course, but it's not to the same extent).  But I'm sure that there are clergy involved in that as well... and of course on a lesser scale, I'm positive that there are Christian clergy members that hold, and support even, bigoted views in general... though usually, in today's world (not in the past, always) that's not really 'militant'.  In short, A) Monks are not necessarily Buddhist teachers, B) the Burmese situation is a clear outlier in both modern and historical Buddhism, and C) the claim that 'leaders' of other faiths are not the ones involved in the 'questionable' behavior is simply untrue.  EDIT: And D) if you actually look at the teachings of Buddhism, is is absolutely not calling for militant action.  Period.  If you argue that it does, you are simply wrong and uninformed, as a basic rule."

That's why I encourage people to avoid authorities and second-hand information and go straight to the source. Look in the book. Then you know for yourself instead of taking someone else's word for it.   In my experience every book or tradition contains some good ideas, some bad ideas, and some primitive and irrational ideas. Unless you look at it for yourself, and unless you know how to use Reason properly, someone will trick you into buying something you don't need.   As far as religions go, Buddhism is, on paper at least, one of the most peaceful. That being said it isn't shocking to hear about the atrocities committed in its name. Pales in comparison to the horrors caused by the Abrahamic religions but still worth noting. The pitfalls of dogma and blind faith."

The anonomous writer has Buddha saying in his previous life he defended Buddhist sutras, but how can Buddha do this when the Buddhist sutras where not created until after Gautama Buddha started to teach. Furthermore Buddha's teaching were originally transmitted orally and then not written down until almost 500 years after Gautama Buddha death. AND the Buddhist Mahayana version (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahayana) arose very much later after Gautama Buddha's death as a split from the older Buddhist Theravada version (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theravada)"
religion,399vfz,redsparks2025,1 point,Thu Jun 11 02:09:14 2015 UTC,"Ultimately every ideology (religious, political or other) or even any sense of commitment and belonging (family, nation, clan, caste, race...) can be used for political gains by manipulation of those.  Even the most pacifist religion there is, in theory, could be used for that, developing rationalizations and excuses (or reinterpretations or even new scriptures) is not that difficult.   Ultimately that is just a factor in the wider political power struggle, seldom the exclusive motivation for political and military action.  Warrior monks are not unheard of in Buddhism. Besides the all famous Shaolin monks there were Japanese versions, Korean monks had a huge role in the defense against a Japanese invasion, Tibet was a theocracy merged with political power when ""dubious"" activities become rather unavoidable. Even orthodox theravadins were not divorced from politics and a lot of their religious development had more to do with decisions of ""brutal"" kings (as was the norm of the time) than peaceful monks.   When things expand and become a factor of social cohesion, something that a lot of people identify with and therefore can be moved by, they also by necessity become a political factor too.  That said, there is a difference in the basic scriptures and traditions that makes militarization more easy or difficult. Among the so called world religions shramana traditions are probably the most peaceful ones in their religious core. I'd say Islam, Judaism and Hinduism have a much easier job when taking ""strong actions"" while I find Christianity to be a bit ambivalent."

The situation with Mahayana is not as extreme as that, but suffice it to say that Mahayana as a denomination did not exist in the time of the historical Gautama Buddha, and when it did come into existence it was precisely through the ""hey, monks, I discovered a new sutra"" process that /u/Dilettante describes."

One common reason is when a post pushes (or even appears to push) a particular perspective, especially when the perspective isn't considerate toward others.  I think blog posts are particularly susceptible to this: even if they're well-meaning and balanced, we see so many blog posts that aren't, that we're skeptical of them.  Just look at domains for the top posts for the week: reliable news sources (nytimes.com, bbc.com, huffingtonpost.com, etc.).  There are also some lesser-known news sources, (like the-newshub.com, the conversation.com, etc.) and some questions/discussions (self.reddit).  There's also a youtube link, but that's not terribly common.  Notice in particular that there are no blogs at all.  No wordpress, no blogger, etc.  In fact, if you search for ""blog"" on that page, there's nothing.  On the front of /r/religion, all blogs are scored at 2 or less.  So, I think that's a clue.

religion,392tat,burtzev,3,Mon Jun 8 21:08:57 2015 UTC,"The big problem is that, to us Buddhists, mindfulness without understanding the Four Noble Truths and holding to the Five Precepts of basic Buddhist morality (do not kill, steal, lie, commit rape or adultery, or get drunk) is likely to reinforce your negative actions and attachments more than anything.   Most scientific and popular accounts circulating in the media have portrayed mindfulness in terms of stress reduction and attention-enhancement. These human performance benefits are heralded as the sine qua non of mindfulness and its major attraction for modern corporations. But mindfulness, as understood and practiced within the Buddhist tradition, is not merely an ethically-neutral technique for reducing stress and improving concentration. Rather, mindfulness is a distinct quality of attention that is dependent upon and influenced by many other factors: the nature of our thoughts, speech and actions; our way of making a living; and our efforts to avoid unwholesome and unskillful behaviors, while developing those that are conducive to wise action, social harmony, and compassion.  This is why Buddhists differentiate between Right Mindfulness (samma sati) and Wrong Mindfulness (miccha sati). The distinction is not moralistic: the issue is whether the quality of awareness is characterized by wholesome intentions and positive mental qualities that lead to human flourishing and optimal well-being for others as well as oneself.  According to the Pali Canon (the earliest recorded teachings of the Buddha), even a person committing a premeditated and heinous crime can be exercising mindfulness, albeit wrong mindfulness. Clearly, the mindful attention and single-minded concentration of a terrorist, sniper assassin, or white-collar criminal is not the same quality of mindfulness that the Dalai Lama and other Buddhist adepts have developed. Right Mindfulness is guided by intentions and motivations based on self-restraint, wholesome mental states, and ethical behaviors -- goals that include but supersede stress reduction and improvements in concentration."

religion,392tat,redsparks2025,5,Thu Jun 11 00:16:36 2015 UTC,"I have been noticing a few negative things about Buddhism lately. I really don't think that is the fault of Buddhism itself but is actually a sign of the West struggling to adapt Buddhism to Western culture which wants to dissect everything, put it all under the microscope, have an indepth philosophical discussions about the results, take what elements it likes, discard what elements it doesn't like, and then later comes up with it's own Westernised version but by another name, and sell a lot of books to make money. Honestly speaking I believe the West will eventually fail with Buddhism because of the Western cultural insistance of approaching it from the outside and at arms length. As Buddha said ""All efforts must be made by you, Buddha's only show the way"".   What is most offensive about the article is that it states ""And here we come to an important point. Buddhist meditation was designed not to make us happier, but to radically change our sense of self and perception of the world."" No! Buddhism was created to help stop Dukkha (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dukkha) and therefore to help make us happy. And yes, it does so by changing our perceptions through meditation. It is only when one applies unguided instructions by oneself from a book which pretends to be scientific that leads one to unhappiness. In Buddhism the teacher and the student relationship is very important. Just like the Jedi master and his/her Padawan. Or a psychologist and his/her patient. You really can't do Buddhism on your own. If you do then it's only on a superficial level unless you have great patience with the prescribed practices and you don't loose sight of the ultimate goal of those practices. As Buddha said ""I have taught one thing and one thing only, dukkha and the cessation of dukkha"".  BTW here is an entertaining documentary on youtube about the Buddha's Life (note, it's 2hours long) (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj1JvpPUiX0)"

Emotions are a big dilemma everyone faces because they are beyond our control. If we don't understand them then they control us. Our brains squirt out certain chemicals without our permission, and we as the silent observer can find ourselves behaving without free will.

religion,39314b,GeekYogurt,-2,Mon Jun 8 22:06:07 2015 UTC,"Sure. I've always heard that man was created in the image of God. But as I grew older I saw that the universe is very scientific in a cause and effect sort of way. Then I learned about geometry and saw it in a seed, as it grew to hundreds of times its size and produced fruit for humans and pollens for bees (or whatever). Nature effortlessly creates the best art, but how does a seed know how to grow into a tree? The process is so complex and orderly that whatever life force fuels its growth is not perplexed by that seed's intricacies, but rather it is very simple. So is it evolution that consolidates the growth pattern, so that the process is basically 3.33333333, or is it God? Is God a person, if so, does it matter? Much like the seed, humans eventually came about, as the only self-aware animal that on average is extremely smart. Is the same life force that guides the seed the same life force that brings humans into existence? I think that this could be explained by a 'God particle', but God is prob just science evolving."

religion,39314b,fight_collector,2,Tue Jun 9 00:21:46 2015 UTC,"I think I'm picking up what you're laying down, brother. Let me see.  Evolution is intelligent design.   The entire universe is permeated by a kind of autonomous intellect that organizes and reorganizes matter and energy into ever more complex forms, the culmination of which appears to be living organisms capable of self-reflection.   Creation in this context is not an instantaneous process but a long and painstaking one whereupon Nature refines the basic building blocks at its disposal until sufficient variety exists for the formation of more elaborate structures. When a planet harbors the right conditions, like earth for instance, Nature goes into overdrive and creates a staggering amount of biological forms which it then continually refines.   The design is arrived at by a process of trial and error, of elimination and mutation.  Some people here seem to have missed the significance of your ""seed"" comment. It's easier for some to call you a stoner than to grapple with what you're attempting to say. The seed is imbued with Nature's will. No one teaches it to grow: it simply does so. Break the seed open and you will find--nothing. And yet from that void comes the mighty oak itself! You want to know God? Contemplate the seed and you'll start to understand.  ""Nature does not hurry,"" says Lao Tzu, ""yet everything is accomplished.""  You're flirting with a lot of great ideas, /u/LookAround. Keep digging. You won't regret it.

It's scientific and it's spiritual, but religion seems moral and evolution seems like a magical process with a connotation to the name. It's like identity branding. Like how words sound exactly how they're supposed to because the Latin language got it right.   Sharp... Sharp. Boo. Cusp. Nuzzle, murder, askew. These are words that when said aloud sound like what it describes.   Have you been noticing the power of 3's? 3 elements that come together to create synergy. I like art a lot so I notice how nature is perfect art, even when it is damaged. Wow, if there is a creator, they must be vastly confident."

It's an incredibly difficult topic to discuss, especially on a message board :) I've got lots of resources and, more importantly, lots of practice writing about this stuff. Even so, words can never really do it justice.   Have you been noticing the power of 3's   Trinities are everywhere :) The human organism is made up of Mind, Body, and Self. Likewise the universe is a trinity of energy, matter, and the force that shapes and organizes both. The ancients knew this force by many names: Nature, Tao, Brahman, Logos, or simply God.   Speaking of numbers, 4 is also of symbolic importance in spiritual and philosophical traditions. Note the four elements, the four cardinal points, but also the 4 fundamental forces of Nature: the weak and strong nuclear force, electromagnetism, and gravity. All other natural laws are derived from these four. All that we can sense, detect, measure, and behold was made by these four laws acting in concert.   It's scientific and it's spiritual   Einstein said, ""Science without religion is lame, religion without science is blind."" The dichotomy between spirituality and science is, like all dichotomies, ultimately false. In order to know the Truth, we need both."

If what you misquoted was the Kalama Sutta, then it seems particularly easy, since the way it seems to get misquoted actually uses the words that are in it, just interpreted selectively, and out of context.  By contrast, I've seen quotes attributed to historical figures that were never said by them,not even in part, and just plain sound completely wrong. Those seem easier to pick out, at least if one has read their writings, or have some idea of what they actually thought/believed.    Like this faux Marcus Aurelius here.

I've spent 2 years studying biblical Greek (called Koine, or ÎºÎ¿Î¹Î½Îµ, meaning common). When is comes to translation, we tend to follow the rule ""literally as possible, freely as needed."" For instance, if there's no comma in the Greek where English would need one, of course you would put the comma. That being said, American English translations would never go so far as to, say, change mentions of wine to coke. Or they wouldn't have Jesus feed the 5,000 with Pizza. So when it comes to translation, we attempt to retain culture and to understand it, rather than alter it. THAT BEING SAID, there is enormous room for cultural interpretation in how a worship service is conducted. Christians believe that God is above culture, so any group of people could choose how to appropriately conduct their worship. Hope that makes sense."
