Don't know if the phrase ""innocent until proven guilty"" would hold up, but how could anyone prove that you were breaking the law?

Some people are Video Editors and could not care less about RC Aircraft.   The people you see posting on these boards are both.  I have a feeling it's a very small minority of all Pilots.  Just because you're a pilot does not mean you have to edit videos.  I'd rather spend my time building or flying.

fpv,3e4hwh,theony,1 point,Wed Jul 22 06:29:09 2015 UTC,"It depends on what you want to do and what equipment you already have. Most people go for some flavour of 5.8GHz video system and small camera, anything in the 200mW power range will get you at least a few hundred metres of range without trouble, but bigger power output usually means the modules themselves are bigger. You can get away with less power but then you have to think about antennae.   Watch out for compatibility between different video systems, for frequency matches,  legal issues, PAL/NTSC encoding."

fpv,3dwsxq,crankerson,2,Mon Jul 20 20:31:47 2015 UTC,"The Nano QX 3d is a decent platform to stick one of those micro spektrum camera's on. They have larger motors and a slightly larger battery than the normal nano qx or the fpv version. The inverted props are a plus as well, since they don't get in the way of the camera.   Or you could go check out the frames at Picnic Quads, or Micro Motor Warehouse, and stick in your own gear.   A third option would be to get a toy grade fpv like a Hubsan X4 107D or Estes Proto-X FPV."

fpv,3dnm8t,kubed_zero,2,Fri Jul 17 19:04:46 2015 UTC,"You will need an FTDI device to flash it.  So I just got my Minimosd working last night - and posted up part of my saga over on Openpilot forums - so this is all fresh in my head.  I would recommend getting the kvmod minimosd.  I got mine from Readytoflyquads.com.  They sell two different ones - the big one and the little one. I have both - the big version ($10) is on my older ZMR and the smaller one ($15) is on the newer ZMR that I'm building with bigger motors.  I recommend the smaller one, not for the size but because it seems a bit easier to use.  I get confused with all of the different versions of the minimosd but with some you need voltage dividers for the battery and other things, and you do not need those with the mini version of the minimosd.  I will say that soldering to the pads on the smaller one takes a steady hand though.  Once you have it, you will need an FTDI adapter to program it to configure what you want to see.  If you don't mind seeing everything based on the way it was set in the factory, then you can just plug it in and use it.  But if you want to start changing things, you'll need an FTDI.  You can get an FTDI programmer from Sparkfun ($12), Amazon ($6), readytoflyquads ($5) and Ebay ($3).    Then you'll need the drivers for the FTDI.  There's two pieces of OSD software - the GUI to configure it, and then the firmware that goes onto the OSD itself.  It seems to me that you want to keep them the same - so if you want a new GUI, then get the new firmware.  There's two ways to get the firmware on the board - assuming you want to change the firmware - you can compile it in the Arduino environment that you download from Arduino, and then configure it for the board and then make sure the libraries are in the right place and then upload it, or you can get a prepackaged .hex file and just upload the .hex and you are done.    Some developers only give you the option of compiling and uploading the firmware, other developers will only give you the .hex and seem to make it harder to find the source code for the firmware.  So you sort of need to do whatever it is that the developer wants to you do.  Once you have the firmware, use the GUI to configure it and upload the changes to the the OSD using the FTDI programmer and you should be good to go.  Some also want you to upload a new font or else you'll get funky characters instead of the symbol you are supposed to see.  Lastly there's actually wiring up the OSD.  There's two sort of paths to this.  If you just want battery voltage and RSSI, you can just get the RSSI from the receiver and tie it in on the new mini postage stamp sized minimosd, or you'll likely need a capacitor and resistor to make a low-pass filter on the old minimosd.   On the older minimosd, you also may need a resistor divider (two resistors of sizes that you need to calculate based on the battery voltage), whereas on the new one, you just solder to the tiny pad and it just works.    The other path is to tie in your telemetry.  For this you will need an OSD package specifically for your flight controller.    For a naze32, follow the instructions on this page:http://blog.oscarliang.net/minimosd-micro-setup-naze32-pid-rssi/"

I'd recommend a 250 or 600mw 5.8hz tx (fatshark / immersion rc are most common) . You don't need a new receiver/goggles if you confirm the frequency is jn the list of fatshark frequencies.   Also, be aware that 5.8ghz isn't great with any physical interference so range will be in an open space. Fwiw, I've gone 2500ft on a fatshark 250mw in an open area but lose range behind 2 trees that are 50ft away."
fpv,3dmwel,mattklein623,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:55:38 2015 UTC,"I didn't push the limit on the range because there were areas where the signal was entirely lost for a few seconds. I was flying around a running track where I was seated in the middle of the turn. The signal was worst at around 60-80 meters off, but this could be caused by the  metal lamp posts positioned around the track.  The reason I chose 25mW in the first place is because the quad is for racing, so we'll be four of us flying together. From what I gathered there could be some problems with interference when using higher powered transmitters."
fpv,3dmwel,xiMbd03u1,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:12:24 2015 UTC,The 25 mW is actually not putting out 25 mW according to the FCC documents. It's actually more like 0.4 mW. Long story short: it's worthless except for the most basic of LOS flying. Get the 250 mW.
fpv,3dmwel,xiMbd03u1,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:52:52 2015 UTC,Do you know if there will be any problems with interference when flying up to four quads with 250mW?
fpv,3dmwel,Manduck,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:54:05 2015 UTC,"You can get up to four non-overlapping with 250 mW. If you have exactly the right combination of channels, you can get up to eight. Having racers swap between left-hand and right-hand polarized antennas can help as well. Put adjacent channel racers on opposing polarity.  http://www.rcgroups.com/forums/showthread.php?t=2266883"
fpv,3dmwel,Manduck,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:00:52 2015 UTC,A patch or helical antenna on your goggles will help but it will make the reception much more directional. Most miniquad flying folks I come across(including myself)  use the Immersion RC 600mw 5.8GHZ vtx. A 25mw is only good for doing close flybys in an open field. You won't really be able to take part in the full miniquad experiance unless you get a more powerful transmitter. Skip the 250mw and go straight for the 600mw.

If you are transmitting, say 5mhz left or right to the channel you are receiving, everything will look good for a few meters and than image quality will decrease fast. Additionally, keep in mind that you have to set both frequencies for your eyes wide apart so they don''t interfere. I'm using band E, channel 4 and 8 for left/right eye. Don't know if that is of any help, its just the frequencies which work fine for me. Another point: What are the characteristics of the video link breaking down? do you lose image on one eye first or on both at the same time? and a third point: have you ever switched on the transmitter without antennas attached? This will destroy it within minutes."

fpv,3dhcxh,FieserKiller,2,Thu Jul 16 10:28:35 2015 UTC,"pointing them to the ground is the optimal position, but nobody does that on racing quads because the antennas are damaged easily on landings and takeoffs. However, it brings only some benefits if you fly directly over your head - which is not hat common.  I'm afraid your transmitter was damaged by running it without antennas. if i recall corretly the manual warns you in several places not to do that. sending 2x600mw into the air is a lot of energy, which cant escape when no antenna is connected, most probably some resistors or other components burned down the amplifier cuircuit.  But before you buy a new one, i would check it with a friends receiver first. every common 5.8Ghz 2D receiver will receive your videosignal just fine if you tune it to one of the two frequencies where your transmitter is sending at.  An idea I had but have not tried yet: When you look at the connection wires to the 3D cam, you see they consist of 2 signal wires, +5v, ground and audio.  It _should_be possible to wire the 3d cam to 2 common 2D transmitters if you power the cam oof one transmitter, short both transmitters audio-in with ground and feed the two signal wires for each eye to the 2 trasmitters video-inputs. I'm planning to do it this way when my transmitter breaks, because the original one is heavy, bulky and pretty expensive."
fpv,3dhcxh,FieserKiller,1 point,Thu Jul 16 10:58:48 2015 UTC,"I'm gonna give one more go the original without killing it, but yea that solutions seems more suitable for this, as you can customize the power and size of the tx according to your desire"

fpv,3deubl,DarkSlaayer,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:50:04 2015 UTC,I haven't been able to find anywhere published by spektrum or horizon hobby what the actual wattage of the tx. I have seen that most people believe it to be between 10-25 mw due to comparisons of similar power systems. It is the same spmva1100 as the nano qx and doesn't have the hard case like the one sold separately. I find the power to be just fine for the size of these models. I get much better range from mine than in flitetests video.

fpv,3d01z2,EndTheItis,2,Sun Jul 12 09:53:06 2015 UTC,Just flying FPV is probably against FAA guidelines.  I don't know that you need to worry about the 400' rule as well.  You are probably putting out too much power (are you using a 25mw trasnmitter)  Are you flying with a spotter who can instantly take control of the multi in case of emergency?  Are you flying with goggles that block your LOS view?
fpv,3d01z2,jolars,4,Mon Jul 13 17:50:21 2015 UTC,Stay more than 5 miles away from airports and don't worry about it.
fpv,3d01z2,Smoothvirus,2,Sun Jul 12 11:27:48 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure what you mean by this, but the 400' FAA ""guideline"" is not limited to a 5 mile radius around airports. To legally fly a model aircraft under the current regulations for amateur RC pilots, you must stay under 400' everywhere. Yes, it's unlikely you will be fined for going over but it has happened.  Most FPV pilots stay well under 100' (most interesting things to fly around are near the surface), and 400' is pretty high up, you will generally be fine unless you are trying to push it."
fpv,3d01z2,xavier_505,2,Sun Jul 12 15:07:31 2015 UTC,"There is no law that says ""400 feet everywhere"". That's the FAA guideline, and then there's the AMA guideline which says within 5 miles of an airport. The AMA does not agree with the FAA and this is why the AMA is suing the FAA.   I'm a glider pilot as well as an FPV pilot. We don't even start looking for thermals until we are up at 650'. 400' is nothing.  Just stay away from airports.  edited to add that I'll admit 400' is pretty high for a multirotor. I fly those too but not above 400'."
fpv,3d01z2,Smoothvirus,1 point,Sun Jul 12 15:45:08 2015 UTC,"The AMA guidelines say under 400' within 3 miles of an airport, but the FAA only guarantees RC pilots exemption from typical aircraft regulations if they are adhering to the FAA and AMA guidelines (eg: subset of most restrictive guidelines). The AMA may well succeed in filing suit against the FAA, but that has nothing to do with the laws today.  I'm not telling anyone what to do, just what is legally permitted in the US under the RC model aircraft exemption. If you have a different exemption, or are operating under the regulations for 'aircraft', you may have different operating parameters."
fpv,3d01z2,xavier_505,1 point,Sun Jul 12 15:53:02 2015 UTC,"The FAA themselves don't even know to apply ""regulations"" to hobbyist UAV operations. At one point they even thought that the First Amendment to the Constitution didn't apply to hobbyists! Fortunately they got their hand slapped on that one.  Last year when all the baloney came out from the FAA the AMA put out a statement advising to continue operations under AMA guidelines. If we were all following FAA to the letter we would have all tossed our video goggles in the garbage can because those are ""illegal"" now too."

The AMA can say whatever they want, but the FAA can and have issued citations for operation outside their guidelines.  The risk is low, so many people do not adhere (myself included, as an FPV pilot) to the letter of the law, but ignoring or pretending the laws are not there is unhelpful. I appreciate the opinion you are providing on the matter, but the legality is what it is and people should be informed accordingly and decide what they are comfortable with."

fpv,3cx3xa,inafalcs,2,Sat Jul 11 15:28:16 2015 UTC,"I find that yaw and roll at the same time makes for a beautiful turn.  Obviously this has a lot to do with your attack speed. Faster turns require much more roll. Good turns require speed.  What happens when you yaw and roll at the same time is... (when pitched forward in full attack) straight yaw by its self will swing the ass of the quad upwards and the nose down. Straight roll will just tip the quad on its side. But if you mix them, the yaw will bring the nose down and the roll will swing it around. Basically causing the quad to circle but while still maintaining your entry attack angle.  So if your pitched at say 45deg and you do everything perfect, you can maintain a circular path but with a 45 degree attack angle.    When your good at it, it makes for a great video effect above trees etc.  Very fast 180 turns or very fast sharp turns may require roll, yawn, and back pitch.  Doing it all at once in a smooth motion is key. You'll see. .. Pitch forward and find a tree to turn around or whatever. Go a comfortable speed and enter the turn. Throw both sticks together, pitch and yaw. Go slow with the controls.   Practice makes perfect."

fpv,3cx3xa,xiMbd03u1,2,Sat Jul 11 22:47:19 2015 UTC,"You want to learn to coordinate yaw with roll. Do this exercise. Pitch forward slightly. Now yaw. Watch the horizon. When you have yawned 90 degrees it will be tilted sideways the same amount as you were pitched.   Now practice pitching forward then yawning while keeping the horizon level. Use roll to keep the horizon level.   Once you can keep it level, use roll to turn into the turn while you yaw.  Also, fly acro mode if you're not. Autolevel makes for sloppy turns."
fpv,3cx3xa,xiMbd03u1,2,Sun Jul 12 04:34:32 2015 UTC,"Also, there is a tendency among FPV pilots to fly straight at the pylon, then yaw like crazy and try to fly the other direction. Making a 90 degree turn basically. It takes practice to break this habit but you can do it. I used to play Gran Turismo and it really taught me the value of smooth lines. Enter the turn wide to leave it fast."
fpv,3cx3xa,MartyFlyzZzFPV,2,Sun Jul 12 04:38:40 2015 UTC,Keep nose down and maintain bank angle based on your turn radius.  Never yaw the opposite direction of your bank. In other words always have some degree of bank before yaw. And probably not as much  as you  think ( to start try like 10-15deg of roll). Roll on throttle durimg turn like on motorcycle  :)

Then got some cheap LHCP from hobbyking and could go out about 1200-1300 ft and get bad breakup. I finally broke down and got some VAS bluebeam ultras. They are amazing in quality and range. I went out 850 meters (little over half mile) with solid video. Turned around because I didn't want to lose control. I had never gone that far before.

The Headplays are very cheap for the quality. ~$250  It has 1280x800 resolution with a built in 32ch receiver that will receive the ""IRC channels"" and the 'boscam channels"".  It also has an HDMI mini input that you can use to connect HD downlinks or your favorite HDMI capable device for a bedside movie theater.  The biggest difference between these and the Dominator V2's is the  Field of View. Headplay FOV will take up almost your whole vision when you put the goggles on. Dominators will be more centered and smaller but still have a very crisp image. The major benefit of the Dominators V2's is their DVR feature. Headplay cannot currently use a DVR without an external receiver. Although the Dominator V2 does not come with a receiver module so you need to purchase one separately.

fpv,3ciyvs,cemizm,1 point,Wed Jul 8 07:31:32 2015 UTC,They ruin it for me by claiming zero latency. We know it's not actually zero so why not state the real figure?
fpv,3ciyvs,GoatSpoon,1 point,Wed Jul 8 12:58:02 2015 UTC,"Because the latency is microseconds and undetectable by humans.  It is a great system, I have had the pleasure to build 4 birds using the Connex with great results."
fpv,3ciyvs,helicopter-,1 point,Wed Jul 8 15:26:53 2015 UTC,How many micro seconds? Also in your system what is the latency of the photons to photons?   Edit: I ask because I have seen a few setups where a gopro or similar is used with a LightBridge or ConnexHD and the person has said there is no latency when I can clearly see it. Most of that latency is in the camera and screen. If you want an HD picture you would normally use a digital sensor which means the total latency will be on the order of 10ms at least.
fpv,3ciyvs,GoatSpoon,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:37:09 2015 UTC,"Hi,  Just stumbled upon this. My name is Shahar Keren and I'm a Customer Support Manager at AMIMON.  CONNEX is based on AMIMON chip-sets. The chip sets are based on a revolutionary technology, enabling <1msec delay.  As stated above, it's true that the overall latency of the setup is the accumulated delay of all the components. When using CONNEX, you will not have the delay caused by compressing the video, as CONNEX deliver uncompressed video. You will still have the delay caused by the camera and monitor. This delay depends on the specific camera and monitor being used.  For more information, please refer to the following links:  http://www.amimon.com/video-modem  http://www.amimon.com/chipsets"

fpv,3chgv2,FSMCA,1 point,Wed Jul 8 00:15:04 2015 UTC,Because its drag. When you are at altitude you can cut the motor and the prop will swing back reducing drag and letting you glide much of the way home.

Something small with a higher bandwidth recording and 60fps 1080p is definitely something to upset the mobius. The fact that the gopro shouldn't blur and over compress on fast moving scenes as much us a huge thing for fpv now that everyone is into the low and fast style.
fpv,3cb11b,Dsiee,2,Mon Jul 6 22:10:01 2015 UTC,"Seems that someone is down voting everything in this thread.  I assumed I was being down voted because the GoPro is many times more expensive and the Mobius was never in any real competition with gopro.  What I should have said:  I really like the new form factor, I can see it eventually replacing the mobius as the go to for small light HD camera.  Although, the price point is currently not competitive.  Personally, I will wait until these drop in price dramatically before I swap one out for my Mobius."

fpv,3c48v6,kwaaaaaaaaa,1 point,Mon Jul 13 05:22:48 2015 UTC,is it possible it's a voltage issue? if the voltage drops below the operating voltage of the VTX it can cause issues.  I've also heard that sometimes powering up motors on the same battery that's powering a VTX can cause interference and you need some sort of power regulator

As I was unpacking, a guy showed up with his two kids and an old high-wing gasser. It was funny because I had never seen an RC plane in real life (except mine) before that.  This guy explained that he had been into RC flight when he was a boy, and he had just picked this model up that day at a garage sale. He had the fuel and everything along with an old-school remote with the huge antenna.  By the time I had smashed my plane into a million pieces, he was ready to fly, and I watched him take it up and run a tank of gas through it, then kinda screw up the landing and break the tail. His kids were super-impressed."

I was still on the ground getting ready to takeoff when my video suddenly went fuzzy then started to show a HUD and a plane's view of the field from above.  I have since switched to channel 7 on my FPV and never have this issue.  It seems people rarely switch from the 'default' channel when they fly.  I also added a 600mw Tx instead of the 250 that came with my goggles - that will show 'em!

fpv,3bmnr5,quadcore64,1 point,Tue Jun 30 13:26:16 2015 UTC,tl;dr  This is not a driving issue.   This is not really something to worry about unless you have multiple quadcopters flying around your head. In the last minutes he covers why. IMD is not going to be a driving issue with the receiver and transmitter geometries used for FPV racing. Typical power levels at the receiver will not be nearly as strong as either of his demos and the third order products will fall off proportionally much faster than input power as the LNAs operate far into their linear region.
fpv,3bmnr5,xavier_505,1 point,Tue Jun 30 16:57:55 2015 UTC,"Hello,   We have tested this and observed severe interference from IMD at ranges of 100+ feet. That is using relatively low power transmitters too. At those distances, the probability of this happening in an FPV race, as we have experienced, are very real. Our indoor races, in particular, are VERY close range."

fpv,3blzin,ErrorAsh,1 point,Tue Jun 30 09:03:16 2015 UTC,"First of all, I hear you guys, it's not an ideal place to fly, but it's actually the only place the park rangers let us race since we only fly low. Prime spots are taken by glider and heli clubs.  It's one of the most secluded areas of the park, so the risk to other people is minimal.  This park happens to be the only park in the region that has a designated RC aircraft area. By ordinance, it's not allowed anywhere else within the city limits.  Secondly, I find myself taken aback at what seems to be an erroneous assessment of a) flying skill and b) familiarity with my surroundings.  While I do increase throttle to stay airborne, I maintained full awareness of the power lines and upon immediately realizing I was still in flight, I cut throttle to descend, and continue on-course.  I wouldn't have shared this video on this sub to display subpar abilities.  Edit: Grammar."

fpv,3bl90u,jonny360,1 point,Tue Jun 30 03:22:01 2015 UTC,"Just so you are aware, flying wings tend to have worse yaw characteristics.  They wag.  It varies on the size of the wing and wind conditions.  Most don't have rudder, which means you can't use something like Ardupilot's yaw damp.  A 2 axis isn't going to hide that.  I've built a couple wings now, though I certainly wouldn't call myself experienced, and I haven't seen anything like a flying wing carrying a gimbal.  A forward mounted gimbal + camera would be a large moment forward of the CoG.  You might have a hard time balancing that out.  Wings have a narrow CoG range.  It also would add a lot to the weight of the plane and I'm not sure how well it would handle belly landings so you might be looking at having to attach gear as well.  Nevermind that heavy airplanes start to get really hard to hand launch.  You're going to need a decently sized wing so that it will make enough lift to keep the whole shebang in the air without needing a literal rocket of an motor which will burn through your flight time.  I'm not saying it can't be done, but I haven't seen it yet and just thinking of the challenges in the 5 minutes I've been sitting here tells me that it's not going to be an easy task, nor something you will probably find ready to go off the shelves.  Many flying wings come as 2 separate wings that you glue together, it's common for people to design custom center sections to carry additional gear.  I'd probably start in that direction, look at some of the current designs and go from there.  I'd say 1200mm minimum wing size.  As always eCalc is your friend."
fpv,3bl90u,notamedclosed,1 point,Tue Jun 30 03:42:45 2015 UTC,"Hey I appreciate the response. I have a 48"" in zagi hp sitting here that was converted to a slope only glider. I was thinking about slapping my gear on it and trying to make it my fpv wing. But I really want to get clean video off of a long range setup. I think I probably need to stick to something like a skywalker/ranger with a 3 axis gimbal."
fpv,3bl90u,StinkyWeezle,1 point,Tue Jun 30 03:55:07 2015 UTC,"Funny, I've got a large self designed wing hanging on my wall because I could never get the CG far enough forward to make it flyable (even with a FC board).  A gimbal might just do the trick to save it."
fpv,3bl90u,whidzee,1 point,Tue Jun 30 06:25:45 2015 UTC,"I'd be concerned about hitting the gimbal on a landing. As wings don't have a fuselage the gimbal will be extremely close to the ground on landings.   You'd need a wing big enough to carry that extra weight. I'd recommend something like the TBRC60, it's a fantastic wing that is big enough that it should be easily able to carry a gimbal. It also tracks super straight. No wing waggle like other similarly sized models.   You might want to make yourself some custom nose skids though. Just to keep the gimbal off the ground on landings."

It's also hard to tell what's going on with the solder/connection job inside the ethernet cable/heat shrinked portion of your wiring harness. I would cut it open to see what's going on in there or make a new wiring harness with some tiny colored heat shrink to label what's what. The soldering QC is hit or miss on those TS58xx skyzone/boscam VTX's too so it's also possible that you've received defective ones from your vendor- they do get hot and overheat easily on the bench if they're not being air cooled. You could also remove and replace the stock heat shrink and heatsink on the VTX with a finned aluminium one from a PC video card or something, but check that vtx/cam/battery cable first!"

They aren't exact but since the SD camera image isn't the sharpest anyway I don't really notice, plus I'm fairly close to -4.   If you were right in the middle of the available corrections then some people order a extra set of glasses from one of those cheap online places and dremel the lenses down to size.  If you order something like the Hobby king ghetto glasses then you can just skip the magnifier and then you won't need anything if you are nearsighted."

The diopters cancel it out, I use them in my fatsharks.  I think it's so your eyes don't have to work so hard to stay on focus, as it's easier on the eyes to focus a little further away"

fpv,3bdb4o,Jmersh,2,Thu Jul 9 21:00:54 2015 UTC,"The site apparently sells the goggles with prescription lenses of varying strengths, which makes me think I'm missing something, since the screens are close and if you're short sighted you can see close things.   The screens (yes, one display for each eye) in Fatshark goggles are very close to your eyes, much too close for you to see them unassisted. This is due to their compact nature (see my Fatsharks on the right vs my brother's Hobby King Quanums on the left).  Because of this and because it's just better, the Fatshark screens have extremely convex lenses right on top of them which actually create the illusion that you are looking at a very large screen sitting far out in front of you. It's hard to guestimate with no frame of reference, but they more or less look like you are in a room that painted all black except for the opposite wall, which is the display.  now, I don't understand the optics or why this is, but the fact is that because of the lensing, nearsighted people actually do view the display as if it actually were a large screen far away, and that means you'll get blurry vision.  I am slightly nearsighted and experience this myself. I usually wear contacts so it's not a problem for me, but when I have used them uncorrected I get the blurriness.  Normally I got for my contacts, but I have used the diopters and they work fine. They slide in from the side and they don't interfere with normal use. Mostly I bought the diopter set to give rides to friends and family. They come in -2, -4 and -6 so if your script is below -8 you are probably going to be good.  I have approached an optician about getting diopters made to custom prescriptions, and he is waiting to get his hands on a set of stock diopters, but from looking at the goggles he has a general idea of their shape and thinks he could even have a custom setup done (my dad's eyes are all over the place."

The trick is managing the controls when the airframe is nose-in (nose pointed at you).  That said, you might frustrate yourself out of the hobby if you don't go FPV.  Some quad controllers have features that force the airframe nose-out at all times.  Cheaper is not really better, there is a threshold that you could go below that is intended for experienced flyers who don't need the benefits that you would otherwise have to pay for.

fpv,3b6whe,xiMbd03u1,1 point,Fri Jun 26 15:05:51 2015 UTC,"I would suggest moving the control antennas away from the vTX antenna. Having them that close together will increase the front-end noise at the receiver, even though they are on different frequency bands. Whether this results in functional reduction in range will depend on what receiver you're using and what distances you fly. For a mini quad, which is typically flown pretty close in, it may not matter.  Also, having the ""whisker"" antenna in that location seems like it's begging to have them get into the prop during a crash."
fpv,3b8ps1,werminghoff,2,Fri Jun 26 21:46:29 2015 UTC,"I have answered a very similar question before regarding swapping TX/RX antennas, here is the gist:   The 3 lobe antennas used are better matched to the 50 ohm transmitter outputs which means less reflected power, while the 4 lobe antennas have better polarization characteristics (better at rejecting reflected cross-polarized signals, which is good). If you switched them, the only difference would be due to the transmit antenna reflecting slightly more energy back into it's self as opposed to the receiver. The receiver is reflecting pW while the transmitter is reflecting mW so it will get warmer.  Generally (and in this case), antenna links are symmetric. If you don't factor in heating, both scenarios are identical.   So the difference is negligible. Many people swear up and down that it works way better the way they are 'supposed' to work, but there is no magic here, just physics. Confirmation bias is real."

fpv,3b8ps1,ThanksForFlying,1 point,Fri Jun 26 23:13:34 2015 UTC,The ones I'm looking at are a pair of four leafs antennas. So I shouldn't use those on my transmitters?
fpv,3b8ps1,jhall589,1 point,Fri Jun 26 22:52:24 2015 UTC,"the 4 prong one is intended for the receiver. 3 prong for TX. I have absolutely destroyed a 3 prong while out flying and in a pinch (never go home til the batteries are dead) threw a spare 4 prong on there, not horrible, not the best."
fpv,3b8ps1,jhall589,1 point,Fri Jun 26 22:55:54 2015 UTC,"Ok, so they work. Please, can you provide some more details about how ""not horrible, not the best"" it gets?   I don't need some really specific numbers, you can give me just a guess of yours... Something like ""you'll get 50~70% of the range if you use 4-leafed antennas instead of 3-leafed antennas""  I'm not really looking for long-range flight, I just want to start playing around with some FPV racing. If I end up loving it (which I think I will), then I'll go for the best results and improve my gear."

fpv,3b6uj3,hofftari,3,Fri Jun 26 13:15:13 2015 UTC,"Go to plane for what you're talking about would be a Skywalker 1680. Can carry full FPV gear and around 5000mAh of batteries no problem. Also could stay up there for well over half an hour, and lastly it has dihedral wings for good stability for a new flyer"
fpv,3b6uj3,coltonrb,1 point,Fri Jun 26 14:58:53 2015 UTC,"I've been looking at that one and the Skyhunter, and I rather go with the Skyhunter if I had to choose between those two (No, COFPV hasn't made me biased at all, no no). How are your opinions about Skyhunter vs Skywalker?"
fpv,3b6uj3,coltonrb,2,Fri Jun 26 15:06:15 2015 UTC,"This is actually quite funny because the skyhunter is my plane (my dad has the Skywalker). The skyhunter is overall a harder plane to handle, launching is harder, flying is harder (unless you have an autopilot like I do (cyclops storm)), and gliding/landing is harder (flies like a pig if you're gliding). But if you can get over that, it's also a better plane in the sense that it has WAY more fuselage space, way more payload capacity, and can handle way more wind than the skywalker can. Also, don't forget that the skyhunter takes much longer to setup (more carbon beams and connections). From experience I would say unless you travel with it pre-assembled then it takes a good 3x longer to prepare for flight that the skywalker does. That is why I didn't recommend it, and I would especially not recommend it for a beginner due to its bad stall characteristics and not-so-great launching."
fpv,3b6uj3,coltonrb,1 point,Fri Jun 26 16:18:22 2015 UTC,"Sounds good. I'm a pretty decent flyer with my skills today, but it seems that the Skywalker has the upper hand since I'm not after high payload, nor is the longer preparation time.  And tell me, those rudders on the Skyhunter, are they only for show/aerodynamics, or can you modify them and add rudders?    I've found out about this little thingy just recently: http://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/__53815__Phantom_FPV_Flying_Wing_EPO_Airplane_1550mm_V2_KIT_.html  Any thoughts?"
fpv,3b6uj3,coltonrb,1 point,Fri Jun 26 17:31:25 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's another advantage of the skywalker, it has a useable rudder, the skyhunter only has them for yaw stability, and you can't control them. I would also not recommend a wing for a first plane, they are kinda hard to get the cg right and if you don't it generally doesn't end well. Also, they have no natural leveling effect so they will hold the roll angle you put then at and yaw into the ground (wings also don't have yaw control). I definitely would recommend skywalker or if you want something smaller and tougher, the VAS spark is a little harder to build but significantly stronger. It is also smaller than the skywalker, but doesn't breakdown. For it you can get around 30 min flight times max with fpv"
fpv,3b6uj3,coltonrb,1 point,Fri Jun 26 22:11:46 2015 UTC,"I've gone and ordered a Skywalker from fpvmodel.com now, will arrive in less than two weeks!  What are your thoughts on flaps? Is it a good thing to have? And even though they recommend 9g servos, is it maybe better to go a tad higher?"
fpv,3b6uj3,Youdontreddit,1 point,Sat Jun 27 19:29:19 2015 UTC,"Sweet! Flaps are OK to have, and are useful if you have a shorter than average runway, otherwise I wouldn't bother. 9g should be perfectly fine, if you go higher you might get servos that are too big to fit the slots."
fpv,3b6uj3,schzap,1 point,Sat Jun 27 22:54:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I was thinking that maybe servo size would be too big if I moved up.  I was asking more specifically about flaps on the Skywalker. Do you use it, and if so, is it useful? Maybe it's good to have flaps for hand launching it."
fpv,3b6uj3,Youdontreddit,1 point,Sun Jun 28 09:56:39 2015 UTC,"If you have your skywalker weighted down, then yeah, they would be quite useful, but for mine (has a full FPV setup but no HD camera) I never use them, actually I never even cut them out... Anyways, it's still really easy to hand launch, I just use a little over half throttle, angle about 20° up and toss like a football (American football if you're anywhere but America). It just soars right out of my hand and keeps going until I can get my hands on the controls"
fpv,3b6uj3,coltonrb,1 point,Sun Jun 28 12:55:06 2015 UTC,"Sweet, can't wait for it to arrive.  I have a couple of Graupner 9x5 props that I will probably use for it, so I guess their recommendation of a 1000kv motor works good, but I can't find a good motor for it. What are you using?"

Quick question: Do you know what was causing the oscillation? I have a NanoQX that does that in high wind. I figured it was the flight controller attempting to compensate for heavy crosswinds.  Also: What rig are you flying? I am gathering as much info as I can before I destroy my wallet and take the plunge into the 250 class."
fpv,3b75hb,DiabloMuchacho,0,Fri Jun 26 21:35:58 2015 UTC,"Thanks, i will always up vote creativity, especially when it is relevant. I have ttried many things to fix my wobbles. A pro in the industry said my motors might be too high a kv for my cc3d and the frame size. I went super cheap china 250 clone, from myrcmart.com., it was  worth it, but i should have gotten the 12 amp escs and the 18 size motor, not 2206. I am also using my mobius for live feed. There is a delay, hence why in my video i get no where near the ground or trees, having audio would help. Definitely go with a ccd camera, so you have no delay."

fpv,3b75hb,ThanksForFlying,1 point,Fri Jun 26 22:12:24 2015 UTC,"I believe it was a faulty motor or bearing since new. I have spent days on end pid turning. And you are right, it is tough to fly like that. Not having sound is probably worse though."
fpv,3b75hb,ThanksForFlying,2,Fri Jun 26 22:38:05 2015 UTC,"ah that would explain it. a good way to check is to remove the props give it some throttle while holding the quad level and slowly pitch and roll it to see if one motor is hacking it. you could also check your connection from ESC to motor, had a high run in with a tree once and it managed to break a connection that just needed a bit of solder."

fpv,3b0n2d,mycodude,3,Thu Jun 25 00:42:33 2015 UTC,"I tried to center it around the frequency I usually use (5860 MHz) and it's LHCP. The coax cable I used is pretty nice and semi rigid, so it'll make a perfect vTx antenna! Pretty happy for my first antenna ever although it wasn't as easy as I hoped it would be. I tested it against a skew planar wheel I bought online via a 30 dB attenuator and the signal strength was very similar!"
fpv,3b0n2d,PerceivedShift,1 point,Thu Jun 25 00:47:30 2015 UTC,So in theory I should be able to make a pair of antennas for each frequency I use?
fpv,3b0n2d,Jinx083464,0,Mon Jun 29 19:56:38 2015 UTC,"Yes and no. For clover leaf and skew planar wheel antennas the bandwidth is pretty large so the tolerance for measurements is not as crucial as for example an Airblade or a Crosshair. This means that even if you use precise measurements for a specific frequency like I did, you will still be able to use it on other 5.8 GHz frequencies without issues. Helicals have an even larger bandwidth, and I've even seen somewhere that you can make a helical that picks up both 900MHz and 1.2GHz without significant signal loss in either band. Now for a crosshair antenna, the bandwidth is only about 50-100 MHz, so you HAVE to center it around the frequency you plan to use. It'll still work outside of this window, but you lose axial ratio (rejection of reflected waves which reduces multi-path interference) and gain pretty fast beyond that range.   I guess with this one I did it more for practice than practicality. I really admire Alex Greve (IBCrazy) and his perfectionism, so I guess I wanted to see what it's like :)"
fpv,3b0n2d,Durakan,5,Mon Jun 29 20:18:22 2015 UTC,How much time and money did it take for you to put together your own antenna?  I'm not sure why buying cloverleaf antennas cost so much as their material cost seems like it should be quite low.
fpv,3b0n2d,Durakan,4,Thu Jun 25 03:59:20 2015 UTC,"Not only is the initial cost pretty low (especially if you're willing to wait for some stuff from China), but I now have enough materials to make a lot of them. Basically, the wire is $10 for a 2 lb spool and that's a lot of wire for 5.8 GHz antennas. The only other materials are the coax pigtail cables that I cut in half to make 2 antennas, and you can buy those on eBay from China for ~$2-3/piece. The real challenge is patience and precision during assembly. I also watched a bunch of videos by IBCrazy and other people beforehand, as well as read /u/osliang's blog.   I just finished building my second antenna - a skew planar wheel (the typical circular vRx antennas) and want to try a double helical next. Eventually I am hoping to be good enough to attempt a crosshair or maybe even an airblade. Not only is this stuff cool and beneficial to the FPV experience, but it's also the cheaper end of the hobby. And as a bonus I get to learn more about antennas in general!"

fpv,3b0n2d,ybtablv,3,Thu Jun 25 18:45:06 2015 UTC,"First and foremost, I recommend watching all of Alexe Greve's (IBCrazy) videos on ""Success in FPV"". He also made a nice video on how to make a clover leaf antenna, since he invented the design and shared it in this RCgroups thread.   Another useful resource was Oscar Liang's blog, which is basically a nice summary in written format. There are also a ton of fpvlab and rcgroups threads on many different antenna designs and tweaks, no way I can post all those links considering I'm also quite lazy :)   Hope this is enough to get you started!"

In the last 6 months or so none of the different 200mw vtx's /u/mycodude and I have used (which is 3 different ""brands"" with different revision numbers and at least two different board layouts) nor the two 600mw vtx's have had any issues.  In fact, my aomway 200mw vtx survived two accidental battery reversals.   Combined with the fact that all these vtx's cost between $15-$30 it's a P good deal.   I like surveilzone personally."

fpv,3b3akv,ErrorAsh,1 point,Fri Jun 26 12:15:19 2015 UTC,I wouldn't be so quick to assume.   The 32 ch stuff goes over the entire 5.8 band.   So from 5645-5945  Immersion rc only goes from 5740-5860  So if there are legal (in your country) frequencies between 5860-5945 you would have access to them :-)   My quick Google search on my phone wasn't helping much in finding out what the freq in Germany are but I would assume (possibly wrongly :-) there are more freq accessible to you legally.

Not sure with the transmitter though. I've ordered a PAL and a NTSC camera that should be here next week so I can give both a try and see if that was the issue.

The guy who runs the company seems to very much be the business side of things rather than technical. I'm not sure if that's good or not but it does look like he's hired some good technical guys so hopefully it means they'll deliver.

fpv,3auxum,nothas,1 point,Tue Jun 23 19:08:04 2015 UTC,i'm gonna tell you right now that the wifi fpv it's touting is incredibly disappointing. quite laggy and drops frames all over the place and disconnects after about 30-50 feet away.
fpv,3auxum,toastyman1,2,Wed Jun 24 15:52:41 2015 UTC,"I would say the downside is the Wifi Tethering. Wifi controls will have a small amount of lag compared to 2.4ghz, and have much shorter range (says 50ft on the page). Since the Video is also streamed over wifi that means you have noticeable lag to the video, and you can only fly FPV when wifi is available. So no racing, no outdoor fpv away from Wifi.   You do get HD video, which is nice and a gimbal on such a small quad is cool; but on the smallest version, I'm betting it handles like a turd and will take a hit to flight times.   this seems like a nice starter drone if your trying to get into aerial photography, but honestly I think there are better RTF FPV micro quads out there (h107d comes to mind)"

fpv,3avsw8,everphilski,2,Tue Jun 23 22:16:20 2015 UTC,"Make sure you only have the yellow line connected from the receiver to the goggles. The other line on the receiver is audio and on the goggles it's video 2. That was my issue when this happened to me.  The camera picks up the noise from the quad and transmits it to the receiver. If the audio is connected to the goggles vid 2 line, the goggles sense the signal and to switch to vid 2 which displays the audio as static. When you stop the motors the signal dies and it switches back to vid 1 and you can see again.  I hope that fixes it!"

Read the frequencies.   If you already have a gopro, you can shave off some more cost by using the gopro as your flight camera. Many people consider this bad, IMO it's actually OKish if you are doing more sedate flying and/or have an autopilot with RTL. Latency is tolerable but noticable.

fpv,3aq24b,rcplaneguy,3,Mon Jun 22 16:09:01 2015 UTC,That STYLE of unit can be used so long as it has a digital tuner. The analog knob is a deal breaker. It will drift and you will lose your video signal quickly. You will not be able to put down your controls to male tiny little adjustments.  You wouldn't be able to tell if you weren't tuned in well or you were out of range.   Tl;DR: no

Lost signal?"
fpv,3amvvw,Bemo98,-1,Sun Jun 21 23:00:24 2015 UTC,"By looking at the video most likely. Do you have a failsafe set up? Put the failsafe so it lands with like, idk 30% throttle."
fpv,3amvvw,xavier_505,6,Sun Jun 21 23:07:18 2015 UTC,"Yikes, never use a failsafe like that unless your FC is smart enough to know when you have landed. You are likely to burn out all of your motors and/or ESCs with something like that!"
fpv,3amvvw,Bemo98,1 point,Mon Jun 22 00:22:14 2015 UTC,Then what do u suggest for failsafe??? For the quad just to fall out of the air. But yes that is true. That would burn the motors if it falls in grass. I have the Eagle Tree Vector and it know exactly when it lands. Isn't there some ESC that know when there is an external force acts against the motor and they automatically stop the motors. I forgot which ones are they but I know they exist. I don't know if you could program other ESC to do that.
fpv,3amvvw,Bemo98,2,Mon Jun 22 01:22:17 2015 UTC,"Then what do u suggest for failsafe??? For the quad just to fall out of the air.    For miniquads, yes absolutely, this is pretty standard. Lowest risk of lost model and damage to the quad or anything on the ground."
fpv,3amvvw,xiMbd03u1,0,Mon Jun 22 03:15:57 2015 UTC,"That's a good option. But the best option in my opinion is having those ESC's that automatically stop the motor if an outside force is stopping it. That way it can come down slowly and when it hits the grass and the motors get stuck they will automatically stop. But if you don't have that option, the best thing to do is just for it to fall out of the air. Just like u mentioned in previous comments"

fpv,3amvvw,xavier_505,3,Sun Jun 21 23:10:33 2015 UTC,Yes you can. I'm pretty sure you can. Or maybe you can set up failsafe in the quad's control board.

fpv,3amvvw,Magnumcroft,1 point,Mon Jun 22 07:26:52 2015 UTC,"The 9x receiver doesn't support failsafe. It's been a long time, but if memory serves, it holds last position on loss of signal. This is a real problem because it means that even if you set up failsafe in the FC, the FC will never know there's a problem.  Because of its lack of failsafe, the 9x receiver is really unacceptable for use with a multirotor."
fpv,3amvvw,Magnumcroft,1 point,Mon Jun 22 06:38:11 2015 UTC,And it is the most commonly suggested for 'budget' setups too...
fpv,3amvvw,poopmouth,3,Tue Jun 23 20:24:41 2015 UTC,"Your 9c8cV2 has a non programmable failsafe that can trigger a flight controller based failsafe. You are MUCH better off leaving the failsafe as motors off though... Solve the root problem of poor signal strength to the receiver, maybe an antenna is bad or your placement is problematic. I advise singly against a throttle up failsafe."

fpv,3alalz,icdark,3,Sun Jun 21 19:11:35 2015 UTC,"Luxfloat is quite tricky to tune (especially the D part, it is verty sensitive). Try tuning without TPA. It is possible.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMAc-4UA5nI  The way I do it is quite simple. Start with P @1.5 (both for Roll and Pitch). I @0, D @0. Try some punching, if it wobbles go down 0,2, if not try going up. You should have quite lower P for Roll (from my exp).  Then just add I for holding angles, and increase D for bounce backs."

fpv,3ah98w,thelastsamuraispeaks,2,Sat Jun 20 11:35:38 2015 UTC,"I guess I'll explain myself a lil better and clarify my OP, which was my very first post ever.  The camera cable has a plug with three wires. White (video) Black(ground) Red (5volt). This cable normally runs to the video transmitter. Cool. Well i want to add an osd. Specifically the skylark tiny iii osd. I  went to the middle of the camera cable and stripped a couple inches in the middle. I find a red wire, a white wire, and a bare wire wrapped around the red and white wires. Presumably this is the ground wire (black) acting as a shield. Ok, pause for a moment and let's look at the osd. It has: a wire for the gps, a wire for the current sensor, and a wire to go to the receiver....And 3 pins for a normal servo wire to plug into. Here, i am supposed to have a video out (goes to vtx), a video in (comes from camera), and a ground that simply ties into the existing ground between camera and vtx. So i soldered the gnd from osd onto the bare stripped ground of the camera cable. Awesome. Now, the red and white wires that i stripped, i cut those(snip!)  The white coming from the camera now goes nowhere. The white from the vtx gets soldered onto the white from osd for video out. The red wire comes from the camera and is soldered to the osd red wire for video in. The red wire on the vtx now also goes nowhere.  So after i have it all hooked up like the diagrams I've found, i turned everything on. I look into my goggles and the first thing i see is WORDS! yay! System initializing and junk! This is EPIC! but wait. I see no video other than the osd display. What have i done wrong? Do those loose wires need to go somewhere? I'm using 3s 2200mah 30-40C turnigy 11.1v if that helps you help me (:"

If this helps, usually ground is black, red is power, and white is signal. I suspect the red wire you soldered from your camera to the OSD is actually the camera's power wire, and instead you should solder the white signal wire to the OSD's video in. However, I don't own your OSD, so you should double check its wiring diagram to confirm what goes where."

In the camera side: the bare strands of wire are going to be ground. The yellow wire is going to be the video.  In the transmitter side, the yellow wire is going to be video, and probably the black is ground, but I've seen green for ground on a video tx before, so check the documentation.  Nothing else needs to be connected."

fpv,3a9duf,captain_frisk,1 point,Thu Jun 18 13:04:52 2015 UTC,About 100ms on my #16v2. I've found it usable if not pushing the limits with proximity flying.

fpv,3aa0lr,FlyBiStaff,1 point,Sat Jun 20 17:23:36 2015 UTC,What in particular do you not like about the wrist remote oneshrimp? We'd love to hear your feedback!
fpv,3aa0lr,somerandomguy03,2,Tue Jun 23 00:36:47 2015 UTC,"I guess my first question would be:  What in your concept of operations drove you to down-select this?  It makes sense for athletic gear and watches because they are typically passive devices to free your hands for other activities.   Flying a multi-rotor is not a passive activity.   Further, natural ergonomics have the hands facing each other with palms nearly vertical and facing each other such as holding a traditional controller or horizontally oriented smart phone.  Holding your wrist up and oriented such that it presents the control stick in the right direction just looks awkward.  Meanwhile that hand is just doing nothing.   What are you trying to gain with this nonstandard design?  What was involved with that trade study?   Also, it precludes full manual control, but that's probably irrelevant because it seems to be out of scope of your basic capability requirements."
fpv,3aa0lr,FlyBiStaff,1 point,Fri Jun 26 19:23:46 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your interest in the product and for the very valid questions.   We performed research using a focus group in the Miami area and the data that resulted is as follows:  We had other drones from different manufacturers to use for test flights and found that although users who had already gotten used to controlling drones with a regular remote had no problem using the different drones, those who never had experience controlling a drone or other aerial vehicle and those who just began to learn flying this type of vehicle discovered the following problems (most popular answers listed):   I was lost with number of buttons on the remote. It's hard to synchronize my thumbs in order to control the drone in 3 axis. It's hard to hold the remote for extended periods of time. When I'm holding the remote I feel constant pressure and responsibility for the device, it takes all my attention. My palms get sweaty because of excitement and I was afraid it would fall out of my hands (applies to certain RC models). I don't know where to put the remote after I finish flying or when I put the drone on ""hold"" (applies to certain RC models). I feel constant involvement in the process of controlling a drone and wouldn't put it down even if I put the drone on ""hold"" as I'm afraid to hit the ""hold"" button occasionally.  I feel disoriented when the drone is flying in any direction other than the direction I am looking. Controls become a complete mess.   Overall impressions:   The remote is too big for me (applies to certain RC models). This device should be used by professionals, I don't want to use it (impression of a product for professional use). I don't understand what all these buttons do. I feel uncomfortable holding the remote. I would like to get my hands free of it at least for some time. I don't like to use the neck strap.   After we analyzed participant’s answers we found the following:   Participants didn't like the way existing drone remotes look. Participants felt uncomfortable using the remotes (applies to certain RC models). Participants were lost with two joysticks, and felt disorientation and panic when drone was flying in any direction other than the direction they were facing. Participants found it stressful that controlling a drone requires constant attention and involvement. Inexperienced users could not use advanced vehicles with 3 axis gimbal. Two hour training did not solve the problem in 100% of cases. In order to solve problems that were found we decided to develop a unique combination of obstacle avoidance system installed on the drone that recovers mistakes made by the pilot, goggles with head-tracker sensor that makes pilot see the world with ""eyes"" of a drone to avoid disorientation and wrist remote to make controls more intuitive.   The following impressions were noticed:   Pros    Participants felt more comfortable to control drone with one joystick (pitch and roll). Participants found rotating wheel that controls yaw more intuitive. Participants found second rotating wheel that controls throttle easier to use comparing with joystick. Participants enjoyed opportunity to ""hold"" the drone with a press on the joystick and get to other activities with their hands free when they were asked to. Participants got used to controls much faster (it took them 10-20 minutes). Participants found it easier to operate the device with one hand instead of two. Participants found it easier to use wrist RC and goggles than regular RC and goggles. Participants enjoyed the opportunity to appear on ""selfie"" photos without the remote in their hands. Participants felt more comfortable using a drone when they were told that the obstacle avoidance system was on. Most noticed that the combination of OAS and wrist RC made them think of a drone like a semi-passive device (like a phone or video game) and helped them get rid of feelings of excitement and fear when using drone. Limited gimbal movements helped them to avoid disorientation while flying.    Cons    Wrist remote was too big (solved with beta prototype). Wrist remote was too heavy, it was hard to hold the hand up for extended periods of time (solved with beta prototype). Wrist remote had sharp edges (solved with beta prototype). Controls were not smooth (solved with beta prototype). Throttle control was too sensitive (solved with beta prototype). Yaw control was too sensitive (solved with beta prototype). It was hard to find and press side buttons (solved with beta prototype). System allow you to use the drone only together with goggles (solved with beta prototype by adding 1'8 inch screen). No possibility to take photos and videos ""on the fly"" (solved with beta prototype). No possibility to adjust the wrist RC and the goggles strap to my wrist/head (solved with beta prototype). Camera is not following my head when I look up (cannot be solved for technical reasons). There are certain delays of gimbal reaction to my head movements (solved by changing transmitter and receiver)   This research stands behind the wrist RC design as well as other system features design. As you might already noticed we will crowdfund the product near the end of summer 2015. Crowdfunding will allow us to get feedback on our product design and features from consumers and adjust the product accordingly. Our goal is to make an affordable drone that will bring with it some innovation, be easy-to-use for everyone and won't require training but still keeps flying fun and allows you to really control the device, not just program certain movements using a smartphone. That's the balance we are trying to keep.  I again want to thank you for your interest. Please feel free to contact us directly though our website contact form, we'll be happy to answer any and all questions."

fpv,3ab3cg,Thornsten,1 point,Sun Jun 21 12:32:59 2015 UTC,Hey there. It's a standard little Phantom 2 Vision+. I ask here because I am not an expert on the FPV-type setups that are preferred for drones. I'm basically looking for recommendations of a setup and guidance. I have not done this before.
fpv,3ab3cg,Thornsten,1 point,Sun Jun 21 14:59:19 2015 UTC,"There are a number of commercially available plug-n-play fpv systems. At the higher end of the range is the Fatshark attitude v2 setup, at the lower end is the Quanum kit from Hobbyking  Either one will do what you need, the Fatshark setup gives you a little room to grow.  Alternatively you can piece together your own kit, but it takes a little tinkering. Nothing difficult but it can be tedious. You'll need a video receiver and transmitter that are compatible (same frequency band and at least one common channel), antennas for each (can't go wrong with bluebeams or spironets), a camera (this is a good one), something to view the video on (goggles or a monitor, if you get a monitor make sure it won't blue screen), and a way to power the receiver and transmitter (3s lipo is generally fine for both, double check your camera as some like the fatshark are 5v). And that's all there is to it for the basics.  If you're not sure you're going to stick with the hobby get the Quanum set. If you're pretty sure you will either get the fatshark kit or build your own. I started with those fatsharks and still use the goggles. The camera isn't the greatest but it's definitely flyable and if  it's the only fpv camera you ever fly with you'll be happy with it. The transmitter is great, I'd still be using it today if I hadn't ran it in to the ground several times over the last couple years."

fpv,3a7nwu,HerrMahgerd,2,Wed Jun 17 21:37:04 2015 UTC,"This is a really interesting question.  I'm not sure why, but my ""won't work"" senses are tingling. Then again, they're somtimes confused with my ""not worth it"" senses.  Firstly, is it worth doing this over a simple diversity switch? Are there any situations were diversity won't work but a system like this would? I think diversity will certainly be cheaper than your idea because it requires few components that are cheap.  With FPV gear we can fly through a surprising amount of static, picking out the rough shapes of things through the snow to at least turn around and get a better signal. But the point at which you cant make anything out at all is when the SNR (signal to noise ratio) is such that the noise dominates the signal coming out of your receiver. At this point I don't think having multiple sources of signal would help, since the noise makes up the majority of the signal. However, if you had many receivers and added all of the received signals together it may actually result in noise reduction, because the average signal level of the noise is likely to be zero (so eventually with enough signals, they should all roughly cancel out).  It may also be interesting to add a low-pass filter to the output of a receiver, with a cutoff such that any high-frequency noise is cut out, but the video signal is left mostly intact. How well this worked would depend on the nature of the noise though.  You've peaked my curiosity and I might have to set up a receiver to look at the output waveform as the signal degrades...  Hopefully there's a signal processing major on /r/fpv to shed some light on this."

It was great until i cut a little to close to a tree limb and it fell 40 feet and smashed into my drive way. the 3rd is the $60 sj4000. It been the worst but was also the cheapest. it does not have the option to turn on video out and the boot screen is different. I use it for a dash cam now. i also have a yi cam. It is fantastic excepts it does not come with any accessories like the sj4000's. It also has wifi but since it doesn't have a screen you need to adjust the settings from your phone. They are all knock offs but the cheapest knock off was a knock off of a knock off and kinda lame with no video out setting. I have never purchased a gopro and with the volume of cameras i destroy i probably wont. the yi cam at 60fps and 1080p is my favorite and since i'm not ready to step up to 4k it suits me well."

fpv,3a6yly,Pebble_da_fox,1 point,Fri Jun 19 08:18:05 2015 UTC,"I use the hobbyking breeze for my platform. I have had three of these planes over time. The first two were clones(mercury) I picked up from a local hobby store. Great fun until the wing separated midflight causing a CRASH. It's a two part wing that slips together and held down with rubber bands. The bands didn't break. One wing just kinda..let go. Same issue with both clones. Moving on..  I bought the Breeze in kit form seeing as how i had all these extra parts. I believe it was around $60. Before i flew it, i reinforced the wings with some carbon fiber rods and a dab of gorilla glue. Solid as a rock! I fly this thing like I stole it. As the name implies, it's a breeze to fly. Loops and rolls like a champ. It's not going to win any speed races but it sure does boogey. I run with 3s 2200mah lipo and get around 10 minute flights.  I did crash this one, once, when the elevator push rod came disconnected. Was doing a dive..and...Lawndart. Fixed and flying again in an hour. Tough lil bird.  I have the fatshark attitude v2 setup and it works superb. I don't use a gimbal, but i think u could probably fit that on there somehow. I just modified (drilled a few holes to fit the cable and rubber bands)the canopy with velcro and rubber bands to hold the camera down. Easy as can be. I'm about to try hooking up an OSD to this plane.  As far as portability goes, the main wing is secured with rubber bands (i like rubber bands) so is very easy to remove for travel.   Alternatively, I have heard great things about the Bixler. There is a bunch of different versions but they all sound great.  Hope I was of some help (:"

fpv,3a38pz,BitcoinBoo,8,Wed Jun 17 00:37:55 2015 UTC,That's fucking impressive flying there man
fpv,3a38pz,hypnot0de,2,Tue Jun 16 22:38:27 2015 UTC,"Thanks man! I finally got the quad tuned to the point that the gopro footage comes out acceptable enough to post up, there will be more to come. Training daily for dronenationals :)"
fpv,3a38pz,Cassaroll168,2,Tue Jun 16 23:38:50 2015 UTC,You're flying a gopro on that? Whats your rig?
fpv,3a38pz,xavier_505,2,Wed Jun 17 00:30:28 2015 UTC,From the video:   Blackout Mini H Quad  Cobra 2204 2300kv   DYS 20A BLheli ESC  Acro Naze32  Gemfan 5045  D4R-II  PZ0420  Gopro Hero 3+ Black  Hawkeye 600mw 5.8ghz  Glacier 1300mah 30C 4S
fpv,3a38pz,longhorns2422,2,Wed Jun 17 01:08:51 2015 UTC,"Really seems like this has become a pretty standard rig. I think some people just push way harder than others. I mean a 1300mah 30c 4S, with that build, going that fast...I can't imagine he had more than another minute and a half of footage before the battery ran dry.  Seriously awesome flying."
fpv,3a38pz,xavier_505,3,Wed Jun 17 03:13:27 2015 UTC,Thanks man :)  You are totally correct. I bought these batteries because everyone else seems to be out of stock everywhere.   Timer on the taranis is set for 2:30 so I normally fly for around 3 min tops. I'm sure my batteries hate me
fpv,3a38pz,Kinjuru,2,Wed Jun 17 06:06:04 2015 UTC,"I have a very similar setup with a zmr frame and a custom VTX. It's amazing. I usually run 3S and 6030s though, which still had tons of punch and I get 8-10 minute flights. It's really pretty awesome."
fpv,3a38pz,psychometrixo,1 point,Wed Jun 17 03:21:32 2015 UTC,What batteries are you using?

fpv,3a38pz,Jmersh,3,Wed Jun 17 02:14:21 2015 UTC,Is it fast forwarded??
fpv,3a38pz,Anthaneezy,3,Wed Jun 17 02:37:21 2015 UTC,Nope. Real time.
fpv,3a38pz,Jmersh,3,Wed Jun 17 03:57:45 2015 UTC,180 degree yaw rate in like half a second?
fpv,3a38pz,g00bd0g,3,Wed Jun 17 04:24:57 2015 UTC,I was there watching on goggles.  Luxfloat with all the rates cranked up pretty high.

fpv,3a38pz,Jmersh,1 point,Thu Jun 18 01:42:37 2015 UTC,Yea. See I that's what makes it look fast forwarded.
fpv,3a38pz,KyleWithIowa,2,Thu Jun 18 03:21:07 2015 UTC,"Care to share your pids, controller, looptime? That thing flies excellent!"
fpv,3a38pz,Jmersh,1 point,Wed Jun 17 07:15:28 2015 UTC,How much did this whole rig cost? I'm super new to this hobby...feeling a bit overwhelmed. What store do you buy your stuff from?
fpv,3a38pz,Jmersh,1 point,Wed Jun 17 09:35:13 2015 UTC,"With all due respect it is not exactly  a beginner setup.  Perhaps you could do soft PIDs for starters, but you will need to set really high throttle expo and probably learn on a 3s battery.  Frame is $149.99 on getfpv.com  Motors are $84.00 for a set  ESCs are $60-$80  Receiver is about $25  Camera is about $25-$30  Vtx is $50  Voltage regulator $13  Batteries are $19 each  Radio is $225  Chargers are $35-$300  Most can be found on a combination of readymaderc.com, getfpv.com, hobbyking.com and buddyrc.com"
fpv,3a3olh,cadre_78,2,Tue Jun 16 23:53:49 2015 UTC,"Not power related. Looks to me like a bad VTX, or more likely the very common problem of having the wrong antenna connector (RP-SMA vs SMA)"
fpv,3a3olh,RC2211,1 point,Wed Jun 17 01:48:11 2015 UTC,"So the vtx doesn't have a ""real"" antenna, it's just a wire. It was also shipped this way. It's from FatShark."
