hometheater,3e3kap,bigders,3,Tue Jul 21 18:09:36 2015 UTC,"Find a used Yamaha 5.1 receiver with HDMI. That will be bottom price point for receivers, but Yamaha's bottom end isn't junk. Start with a couple bookshelf speakers (used/craigslist, Micca's might be ok, or DIY), then when you can, purchase a sub.  This gets you input switching, remote control, and a ""standard"" system with which to build from. You can add things like subwoofer, center, surrounds as you can. You can later upgrade things one piece at a time.  If not then the amp + speakers are an ok start, but it's something you will probably grow out of. In this case, plan on using this amp and speakers at a desk or some other non-HT use. Consider used equipment; <$100 should buy a much nicer set of bookshelf speakers used, than new Micca's."
hometheater,3e3kap,leica_boss,2,Tue Jul 21 19:36:32 2015 UTC,"Don't do a simple amp, it's a dead end and if your TV doesn't have 3.5mm or RCA outputs with variable output level (for most TVs, it's buried somewhere deep in manuals, or not mentioned at all if it's capable) then you won't have volume control or the ability to add a center channel (the most crucial speaker for movies). I strongly agree with /u/leica_boss: Start with an AVR, preferrably refurb or used (lots of great deals there)."
hometheater,3e3kap,TactFully,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:29:24 2015 UTC,"That amp can get plenty loud. I'm not sure it could drive speakers to fill an auditorium, but a family room sized space shouldn't be a problem. Typically, if you want to control the output of volume from the TV, you would use the headphone jack and then the regular TV remote (so I think it would work with your TV)  The 5.1 system is going to need the receiver like you mentioned. The big differences you will find will be less bass between the subwoofers, better off axis positioning due to the center channel, and surround effects.  I typically would recommend against connecting these home audio set ups to karaoke systems as they aren't designed for the output. PAs are really what you would need to not blow speakers or encounter nasty clipping. If you are looking for something like that, look into PA speakers and hook those up to your TV instead. They will sound fine, but they will be more expensive and not as nice looking."

Now before that statement turns sour let me explain - they're a bargain brand. Nothing wrong with a bargain, but the simple fact is when you roll with Vizio you have to make a few tiny compromises. You sound like a guy into the fine details. Black uniformity and such. The soap opera effect. Yes, you're correct that a firmware update could fix this stuff tomorrow - but will that happen? Likely, no.  My advice?  You got a good bargain so enjoy it. If you're seriously into tweaking things and having it all be ""best in class"" for every feature - maybe return that sucker and get yourself a Samsung or a Sony but understand you'll pay more. Vizio's strength is that you've got a huge 4k screen for a few hundred bucks less than those other guys."

I however have not noticed uniformity issue.  It appears solid across and I was pleased to read that it was a full array LED TV.  So it may just be that unit, being an open box.  Also, on the soap opera effect, turning the Game Low Latency setting is the only way I have found to mitigate it.  I am hoping for a firmware upgrade as well.

I thought about going for the JS9000 for the full one connect - and the added upgrade potential available through that but the likely hood of me actually going through and upgrading that is unlikely.  I like that the 8500 is a flat panel and should suffer from less of the curved panel uniformity issues.   The deciding factors for me:   Best color available for an LED 4K upscaling similar or better than the Sonys Good motion blur handling   the thing that I'm concerned about is that RTINGs said that the 8500 has ~37 ms of input lag versus all the other samsung panels this year were around ~25 ms -- I'm wondering if thats just an issue with their panel. I haven't found any other reviews that give it such a high rating.

hometheater,3e3lgc,ss0889,3,Tue Jul 21 22:32:42 2015 UTC,"q1: yes, but make sure you can do pre-out front height. IE make sure front height isnt hardcoded to only use a high level output from  your surroudn back l/r.  q2: it shoudl work fine and adjust the pre-out volume.    q3: depends on the processing you apply to surround music. there is upmixing of stereo (which should sound fine but is personal preference) and there is 5.1 PCM type, which will only come out of the speakers that it has a coded signal for. in this case it will ignore front height.    q4: if you need to smooth bass response for all over the room, invest in a second sub. if you only need a single couch to sound good, invest in better speakers. afaik the jbl studios are great, but you'll need to be VERY particular about their placement to get the right sound. they will probably sound better off-axis.    q5: personally i wouldnt bother with the hieghts at all. there are atmos specific speakers that sit on top of your regular speakers, and there are in cieling speakers. i would stick closely to brands here because you dont want front height to sound different than front mains.  Also, im not sure how you plan on having 4 height speakers in a 5.1 setup when your receiver only supports 7 speakers. where are you getting the additional 2 slots for?  i'd recommend setting up regular 5.1 and messing with placement and damping and then running an audio test to see how good up/down sound dimension is represented. with my 5.1 speakers, i ran a test on audiocheck.net that was supposed to go up from the left, across the tv, and down the right side, and it sounded fine.  i'd sooner go 7.1 or 7.2 than to mess with height or atmos speakers for now."

Especially right now when there is practically no 4k content.  The only 4k content out there is streamed which has a lower bitrate.  So now you have to deal with compression artifacts instead of a slightly blurrier picture.  I've seen several calibrated OLED panels.  They all look great, but none of quite matched the quality mine produces.  I'm impressed by it everyday.  Sadly, Samsung stopped making them.  Still, every OLED set has outperformed even the best LED or plasma sets.  If you're looking for the best, I'd say LG has a good 65"" 4k OLED.  You get the best of both worlds.

hometheater,3e1719,DookSD,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:58:03 2015 UTC,"OLED is the best picture you can get in your home currently, followed by some late generation Plasmas.  Of course with Plasma there is no 4k or 3D.  LED lit LCD panels can be great but they cannot keep up with the contrast on OLEDs.  Many independent tests have confirmed it.  I have a 65EG9600 as my panel.  It's absolute fantastic and does not have a professional calibration on it yet.  There is one concern with earlier builds.  There is a case of the edges darkening before the center at low IRE images.  10% Grayscale and below.  This is a known issue and is supposedly fixed.  This is only evident on specific content and <5% of the time.  I have a fix scheduled for my panel at the end of the month.  Early Adopter pains but I'm certain they will be remedied."
hometheater,3e1719,faceman2k12,0,Tue Jul 21 18:03:10 2015 UTC,"There is no ""Best"" tv really, It's all preference and requirement.  Personally i'd say the best at the moment is the Panasonic 85AX940 It's a glorious thing. It has the colour and brightness you get in the cinema, with contrast and dynamic range that will beat the pants of a lot of the OLEDs currently on the market.  I like OLED, and I think that it is the next big tech shift, but at the moment i think the true videophiles would go for a high end LCD if they weren't looking for a projector setup.  OLEDs have great contrast, sure, but the brightness needs to improve, the colour balance needs improving, and the detail in dark scenes is lost on many of them.  If you talk to any video calibrator, they will tell you that OLED is a pain to work with, and can be difficult to get right.   That said the majority of people couldn't give two shits if their display has been professionally calibrated or not. They have the same teething problems that Plasma had back in the day, and are getting better with every generation.  Edit: Yes it's controversial to diss OLED, and I probably exaggerated a bit much, but what good is ""infinite"" contrast if your maximum brightness and dynamic range is lower? yes they will get better and eventually replace LCD tech, then maybe something better will come up.  In a pitch black room an OLED will win, but with a normal level of ambient light a good LCD can show more detail while still having excellent blacks. Your perception of absolute black is completely dependant on the lighting of the room and the scene on screen, it doesn't matter if it isn't as black as can be, it just has to be darker than the darkest thing in your vision and your brain will make it seem completely black.  That is why I don't care much about absolute black levels or absolute contrast, only the relative dynamic range over the entire spectrum and the effective contrast it results in."
hometheater,3e1719,DieselWang,7,Tue Jul 21 05:13:03 2015 UTC,"with contrast and dynamic range that will beat the pants of a lot of the OLEDs currently on the market   what?! Contrast is defined as how bright the TV can get over its deepest blacks. OLED has effectively 0 blacks - no LCD can compete. With a statement like ""beats the pants of a lot of OLEDS currently on the market"" I doubt you even realize how many OLEDs are 'actually' on the market - only LG currently makes consumer-level OLED televisions.   i think the true videophiles would go for a high end LCD if they weren't looking for a projector setup   No. Most videophiles would stick to their plasmas, go with a projector setup, or wait until OLED matures and becomes affordable. Head over to AVSforum for opinions that support this claim.   OLEDs have great contrast, sure, but the brightness needs to improve, the colour balance needs improving, and the detail in dark scenes is lost on many of them   Brightness? They can get pretty much as bright as LCD and definitely bright enough for any room with a lot of natural light. Color balance? What do you even mean by this? Calibration takes care of ""color balance.""   If you talk to any video calibrator, they will tell you that OLED is a pain to work with, and can be difficult to get right.   I really question how many actual video calibrators you'ved talked to considering your well-meaning, but ill-informed statements above."

I'd say he's is right about one thing though, calibrating a OLED panel is much more difficult.  I've helped calibrate two LG OLED's and my Samsung.  All were slightly more difficult than a traditional TV.  The biggest problem would be ABL (automatic backlight).  The rest of his post makes no sense to me.

When my GF wants to watch something in the living room, or we have too many people to watch a movie in the den, it makes me very sad.   And gaming, if that is a thing that you do, is even more amazing on the large format. As someone once said ""sometimes quantity is quality""  Cons - PJ setup cost me more. Receiver is a necessity, PJ takes 30 seconds to warm up. Bulb has to be replaced.   The cons really are so small they would never deter me from getting a projector.

hometheater,3dxzyj,frankbunny,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:18:52 2015 UTC,If the digital audio converter(dac) in the oppo is better than the dac in your receiver then yes you would get better sound quality using analog outputs from the oppo to the receiver.

hometheater,3dxzyj,mgs108tlou,11,Mon Jul 20 18:49:19 2015 UTC,The PS3 is a nearly excellent media player. The only difference between that and a more expensive model is it would be able to decode and process video and audio more efficiently and at better quality. But chances are you won't even notice the differences unless you have a really nice TV with accurate colors and super high contrast.   I'm no expert but from experience this is what I know. I use the PS3 for all my blurays and haven't had any trouble. Set the sound decoder to bitstream.

Without it, dynamic range (the lowest volume to the highest) is compromised.  Because of this, the PS3 or PS4 is mid-fi at best, though it does have a relatively accurate DAC.  That said, the most important audio priorities in are: top quality speakers (the best, flattest-frequency, least distorting you can buy), best possible room acoustics, then working backwards, power amplification, pre-amplification, and finally the sources themselves.  Unless you are playing phono, nearly every digital source is gonna be fine until you've taken care of these other things first."

hometheater,3dxzyj,mgs108tlou,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:51:08 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure what you mean... Most TVs aren't going to display the picture how it was intended (most blurays aren't even a perfect transfer anyway, i.e. the bluray of Interstellar looks like shit) and so having slightly less picture quality probably won't even make a difference. And when I say slightly less picture quality I mean stuff 90% of people won't even notice, including me."
hometheater,3dxzyj,arockbiter,5,Mon Jul 20 19:32:49 2015 UTC,The only difference between that and a more expensive model is it would be able to decode and process video and audio more efficiently and at better quality.

Even then edge-lit tvs with a basic form of local dimming still perform the same if not better allowing for a slimmer more appealing profile. There's a reason every other full array TV's are $4,000+.  I look at tv's side by side all day and deal with issues from them. The color is always off and skin tones are pasty at best. We have 12 out of 18 vizios on display that do not turn on or off unless you unplug the power cable, and that's just this year, every year we replace our own shelf displays constantly because they fail. I don't recommend them to anyone serious about home theater. You can make your own opinion this is just mine.  Everyone has there own experiences mine has just never been good, and unless you actually do side by side comparisons almost any TV will look good.  I will say they're better than Westinghouse"
hometheater,3dxwap,drnickmd,-1,Tue Jul 21 16:31:39 2015 UTC,"I feel that you are just saying things you want Vizo to be and actually don't really have anything to back up your criticisms.  At the price points Vizio has it's an outstanding brand.  Going up against brands such as Samsung, LG, and Sony it really holds it own.  It won't be better but it is far from being worse.  Vizio is not an A+ device but it's not under a B either.  The M-Series' Features, Gray Uniformity, and Viewing Angles are mediocre to barely good.  But the blacks are outstanding ( Dev. about 0.72 % with dimming off), the upscaling good, the colors and contrast very good, and supports native 120hz for 1080p; that sounds like a win.  Calibration isn't garbage either, I don't know where you get that, again it isn't the best but far from the worse.  The only thing close to garbage are the features and they're okay.  The Vizio 4k M-series is really an 8/10 TV which I think that constitutes as a ""Good"""

As someone who just went through the whole college roommates thing, something to consider is what is going to happen after this year or in the next couple years when you guys part ways. Who gets to take the TV? Much better to figure it out now than fight about it when someone leaves and demands their $ back. Another thing I'd strongly recommend for a TV in a college setting, snag a 3-4 year warranty from square trade (usually cheaper directly through them instead of wherever u buy it from) so it will atleast last through your time there.

Cnet lists it as one of the Best TVs of 2015 based on value to performance  I understand that there are some AV elitists who don't think that a Vizio should ever be recommended, but it matches the budget and provides good performance in that price range.

hometheater,3dz28n,Atomm,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:16:23 2015 UTC,"Can you not wall mount the speakers separately? It generally doesn't make sense to attached the speakers to the TV, then have the TV&speakers mounted onto a bracket on the wall. This is made even clearer if you have a thin TV as thats extra weight/stress on a thin screen not meant for such stress.  I would say try to mount the speakers on the wall on either side of the TV. Measure it all out and you can probably manage to squeeze the speakers right next to the TV to create that illusion.  If you are looking for other wall mounts (a model of speakers would be helpful...) you should look at OmniMounts."

With the end result of you not being able to do 4k HDCP 2.2, which is very misleading if you ask me.  And then there are also televisions which will have an HDMI 2.0 port which is HDCP 2.2 compliant but there is only one of those ports. So be very careful with your AV equipment.   Just because the box says it has the features, does not mean it has the features all together that will make it work the way you want.  I learned this lesson with my Pioneer receiver.

hometheater,3dx1lg,_Guinness,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:50:04 2015 UTC,"I'd advise you to et the most up-to-date receiver or processor possible. As has been mentioned be aware that some units (both TV and receiver/processor) will have HDMI 2.0 and/or HDCP 2.2 but they will only be on selected inputs/outputs, so be aware of this limitation when making your decision and selecting/connecting sources. Make sure to use ""high speed"" HDMI cables as well or you won't have the bandwidth for 4k content.  As far as your sub goes, I don't have a basement but I live in an older house with an open foundation. I've had various subs both down and front firing in the front most room of my house and haven't had any complaints over the 8 years I've been here. The room the sub is in will have more impact on your sound than what's under you. There's a chance it could add a little more ""boom"" to the sound but it would be a very unique set of circumstances to have a sub positioned correctly and powerful enough to move that volume of air whether it be a crawl space or a basement. Most of the energy will be contained/heard within the listening room. If you feel you're bleeding too much sound you can always line the ceiling of the basement with dampening material, just make sure you use a dense enough material to catch all of the frequencies you want."

Here is what you said:  ""I contacted AudiPack and they said they do not sell to the United States for ""liability reasons"".

When someone asks you if you can do it yourself, here is what most people would say:  ""I'd just like someone else to do it"" or ""I don't have the right tools / experience to do it"" or ""I can't physically do it for reasons I'd like to not state""  Here is what you said  ""also because I work for a trading firm and probably know more about cable specifications, ratings, and terminations than the contractor does. I have more cable cutters, crimpers, strippers, testers, and compressors than my girlfriend would like me to have.""  So you make it sound like you know everything, but despite the fact you seem to think you can do it yourself or know more than the contractor you still want to hire someone that specializes in the field to do it. That is a huge red flag, someone who's career it is to do this does not want to do a job for someone who thinks they know more than you and can do it but wants to hire you anyway, because no matter how good a job you do the person is going to think they could have done it better and not be happy with the work.

Wattage ratings are marketing fluff that have absolutely no relation to reality.  If you see that system rated at 800 watts, the test was done with 1 channel connected and using a simple and easy test tone.  It has zero to do with how it will actually play in the real world.  In fact, do a little test, walk around and look at the shit little boom box systems and notice how they focus on shit like 1000W of power, or some other crazy number.  Then look at higher end equipment, and you will see a wattage rating, but it won't be very prominately displayed.  That is because people who are in the market for high end gear, know the wattage listings are shit.   Stay away from any all in one system from Samsung, Sony, Panasonic, etc.  They are all crap.

This is a pretty common entry level receiver with all the features you'd need http://www.amazon.com/Yamaha-RX-V379BL-5-1-Channel-Receiver-Bluetooth/dp/B00V5VJ3TM/ref=sr_1_7?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1437366237&sr=1-7&pebp=1437366249922&perid=0JNW1WBV2FC7WQPV1T12  Or you can buy them as a combo such as this Onkyo setup http://www.amazon.com/Onkyo-HT-S3500-5-1-Channel-Theater-Receiver/dp/B0077V88V8/ref=sr_1_2?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1437366209&sr=1-2&keywords=5.1+speaker+system+with+receiver&pebp=1437366217736&perid=1JB6RKMWPESGDA6937N1  And then just buy a Sony or Samsung blu-ray player with Wifi and if you think they'll need it 3D capability.   But for the love of god please don't buy that Samsung HtiB or any blu-ray receiver combo for that matter.   Oh and about the watts, that Samsung player is full of shit. Can't push 800 watts to save its life with real speakers. Those ratings are a bunch of marketing BS because they test them under their own conditions and market whatever numbers look best to the consumer.

Also, what do the watts represent when you are sitting on the couch and listening to sound from movies/TV shows/music?  I think my friend has Onkyo that you linked. Think he might have one with higher watt. Looks pretty similar"
hometheater,3dw9vj,JBarnhart,2,Mon Jul 20 04:39:16 2015 UTC,"If you want to look at it objectively, it's not so much that they ""suck"", but more that they are ""good enough"".  To the experts you'll find here, they suck relatively speaking, but most people would find them to sound good enough- because they don't know any better.   But this is like anything that is sold by large companies. You are settling for comfort in a brand name and convenience because of a lack of expertise. For instance, if you go to Costco to buy condiments, you can buy a Heinz picnic pack that include ketchup, mustard, and relish. We all know that Heinz makes the best ketchup, so we get lazy and settle for this bundle. But the connoisseurs know that French's makes the best mustard, and Claussen makes the best relish, so they buy those things independently for their sandwiches.   The other thing you trade is modularity. A lot of HTiB systems bundle everything so that the speakers only plug into their recovers, and the blueray is built into the receiver. If the drive breaks, you need to replace everything, because nothing else works alone. If you had pieced it together, you could just replace what is broken.  The downside is that if everything breaks, you are chasing down four companies for replacements instead of one. That, of course, is rare- but just the thought of the possibility makes consumers not want to deal with building a system.   Tldr- people with even a little bit of expertise will get more for their money. Everyone else is happy to trade some quality for convenience."

Just that they suck according to what I know is out there and what I like. The part about modularity is big too, I couldn't tell you how many times a week customers would come into Best Buy looking to replace the receiver part of their HtiB or replace a couple of speakers that had blown out and I had to pretty much tell them they need to scrap it and buy a whole new system.   I'll also say that unless the viewer is watching tons of movie or everything in 5.1, they could save the money and go with a really nice 2 speaker system. Just a left and right channel. I can't tell you how many dads felt they absolutely NEEDED surround sound when they're just watching Fox News 90% of the time the TV is on..."

hometheater,3dw9vj,Oysterous,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:44:28 2015 UTC,"That is correct.

Not what I had in mind really tho. When my current charger goes I will definitely not be going the generic route. I will get a proper Apple Charger.   Could you explain the DAC more to me? what do you mean all macbooks have optical digital out?  Edit: Quick edit here.

Set your laptops sound output to 2channel PCM and see if it makes any difference, otherwise you will have to set up the computer to output analog audio from he headphone jack, or use a HDMI audio extractor box."

The best solution is to connect from the bluray player, directly to the soundbar as you are doing, and use an optical cable to the soundbar when you want to watch TV."
hometheater,3dw3fk,emacpgh,2,Mon Jul 20 00:44:04 2015 UTC,"There aren't many truly wireless options.  You could look into a Sonos setup and do 5.1 wireless through that.  It will keep everything in your television and you will simply output the sound to the wireless system.  Entry level is like ~$2k though with all of the components (connect, play bar, subwoofer, and either 2x play 1's or 2x play 3's).  Klipsch has a 5.1 fully wireless networked audio solution based on their reference speakers coming later this year, and an upgraded version early next year based on their higher level reference speakers if you aren't in a hurry."

hometheater,3dw3fk,henbone11,4,Mon Jul 20 01:11:16 2015 UTC,"I'm going to be completely honest, I have never been a huge fan of sound bars.  But, I do get that they have applications and are sometimes necessary.  There are also some very good sound bars.  I am very much a function over form type of person though so I would rather litter my space with components, speakers and subs to achieve great sound than not.    As far as you complicating things by going through a receiver, I'm not even sure what that means.  It wouldn't change anything.  Especially if you mostly use Android TV in your television.  Just don't change sources on your receiver and you're fine.  ARC through hdmi would send all audio generated by the television back to the receiver and out to the speakers in surround."
hometheater,3dw3fk,henbone11,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:17:42 2015 UTC,"I think I might need to go over the basics again.

hometheater,3dw3fk,henbone11,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:08:48 2015 UTC,"What does your receiver do to not play well with your tv?  What model is the receiver?  What is the exact model of your television?  Just make sure that both devices support ARC (I'm positive the television does) and that you are connected to the proper ports.  If your receiver has a single hdmi out, then it would likely support ARC if it was made in the last couple of years.  Make sure you are using the correct hdmi port on the television (usually hdmi 1 on Sharp tv's) as not every port supports ARC.  Once your connections are correct, make sure ARC is enabled in the television and the receiver.  That's really all you need to do."

It would take a long time to connect, and drop out randomly. I went back to using my AppleTV full time and have never looked back.

Were you thinking about ordering from here?  I know if you chat with them, they will take a good $300 or so off the listed price.   Anyway, I ended up going with a 5.0 set of EmpTek Impression series. These. I emailed them and bought the 5.0 system with dipole surrounds for $1380. Having had them for about 2 months, I honestly don't think you can find better speakers without spending significantly more. They retain clarity at insane volume and I would fill your space well.   As for the subwoofer - I ordered a XS30se from Power Sound Audio and while I don't think that would be the best one from your space, I couldn't be more impressed with Tom (The owner, he runs the chat day to day, amazing guy) and the customer service from PSA. Definitely recommend.   As for upgrades, I would imagine you'd notice the biggest boost from upgrading your sub and center channels first.   Good luck and post some pictures when you get some new gear! :)"
hometheater,3duj17,nbrobst,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:05:42 2015 UTC,"One of my concerns is sensitivity, and that buying something below 92 dB or so will all but ensure that I'll eventually need to buy a beefy amp to drive them. My old room was about 12x15 from what I recall, and the speakers could easily get to the point of being excessively loud, but now they're just feeling a bit underwhelming in the larger space, and I need to push them a bit more than I'd like to get the volume I want.   Can I ask what you're using to drive those speakers and your room dimensions?  What caused you to get such a large sub, and are you turning it down quite a bit to keep it from overwhelming the other speakers?  Would you go for something smaller if you had to do it again?  Originally, I wasn't planning to get everything all at once, but it sounds like there are significant discounts to doing so, and I might have to think about that for a bit.  Thanks for that link though, because they also had the PL-980 5.0 setup for $150 less.  That could be pretty hard to beat, especially if they take a bit more off."

I don't think I could use that form factor for my surrounds, as I don't want them to protrude from the wall too much, and these would probably protrude at least 12"" to keep the rear port open.    As for the LR, I really wish this had an option for towers because I feel like any sub I get is going to need as much help as possible to overcome the size of the room.  I'm also not terribly fond of speaker stands, so I just don't see these working for me.  If they had a 40"" tower with an additional driver, I'd probably be all for it.  I also think that if I was going to spend that much on a sub, I might as well get the S/V1500 from PSA.  Nothing against Hsu, but I prefer the finish of the PSA subs, and they seem to be about equal in terms of performance."

hometheater,3dv0gz,CarlosFromPhilly,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:10:38 2015 UTC,"The Energy Take Classic is a okay speaker system. You have given no budget for anything which makes it difficult to recommend anything.

hometheater,3dv0gz,000Destruct0,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:25:19 2015 UTC,"Can you explain why you would t use TV as the source? It's all hdmi into the TV and optical out, so there wouldn't be signal degradation.  I'd say for something that is driving 6 speakers and only has toslink in, $200 (not counting speakers, those are separate).    But I'm starting to learn that this isn't typical, so whatever can get me as close to 6 speakers and one toslink in without paying $400.    I literally need no other inputs or features that driving six speakers with one digital input."
hometheater,3dv0gz,000Destruct0,0,Sun Jul 19 22:39:04 2015 UTC,"Because the sound, switching, and remote are all going to be superior on the receiver if you choose not to use a harmony or something along those lines. If done properly the only thing you need to do to the TV is turn it on and off (when not using the smart features) and that can be done with the receiver remote.  With a budget that low I'd go with the monoprice Energy clone and a receiver.  Receiver $220: http://www.accessories4less.com/make-a-store/item/denavrx1000/denon-avr-x1000-5.1-channel-networking-receiver-w/airplay/1.html  Speakers $180: http://www.monoprice.com/Product?c_id=109&cp_id=10906&cs_id=1090601&p_id=10565&seq=1&format=2"

To be clear, i don't mean for my total budget to be low; I plan to spend around $300 on the speakers, i just don't want to buy a $400 receiver if i'm only ever going to use one input and zero EQ presets, etc.    I have a universal remote already, so i don't need the remote to be superior.  Volume up/volume down is all it's going to need. Switching is also not really an issue.  The TV is high end, and i only need the source changed once at a time.  The rest of the time it just needs to sit there.    And again, the sound won't be impacted. It's not an analog signal, it's digital... Can you explain what you mean about ""sound"" in this instance?  I'm not sure if it's a misunderstanding of the technology or not in this case.  Digital signal coming from a digital source will never have a sound improvement or degradation because it's digital, right? It doesn't need to be amplified or handled, just relayed.  The audio transmission will literally never change until it hits the first speaker wire."

To create a sound that travels that sort of distance and keep it clear while not having to push a small speaker to its limits is the goal.   Also you won't find any surround receivers that get simpler than the basic Denon 5.1, Multiple HDMI and E-Features are the norm now-a-days. The only other choice with a remote control is the SMSL Q5 that has a fiber input and two speaker outs. Can't get simpler.  A basic 2.0 or 2.1 with the Q5 and some beefy speakers would run you under $300. $130 amp + $130 speakers Fluance SX6  That is as simple as it gets."

Their classic line of bookshelves have always been a great buy, Atoms, Mini-monitors, Titans. I own a pair of the ver5 Atoms atm.  However I've never heard their MilleniaOne line. I kinda diverged away from cone and dome and went to horns. The only thing I see that might give me pause is the frequency response on the 3.0s are only down to 120Hz, they do list a 76 frequency extension (with no mention of dB down at that point, so maybe -10). This is a little high, and you may find that you get subwoofer localization with the higher crossover point you will have to use.  I notice the Atoms are also a bit cheaper, with larger woofers, lower extension and higher sensitivity to boot. Atoms all around would sound great for sure. But when you mention 'cost no object', well now the door is wide open. Lots of other speaker makers that offer great stuff. PSB for example is another great Canadian company that competes directly with Paradigm.  Are you dead set on wall mounted speakers? Also, if you have some nice energy speakers that you like, perhaps consider spending the money on a nice front pair or front 3 set, use your current speakers for surrounds and then upgrade if/when you wish?  The JBL L820 was nice last time I heard them. Magnepan makes an on wall version with the 60day money back guarantee.

hometheater,3dsov5,kopkiwi,2,Mon Jul 20 04:15:40 2015 UTC,"I had the same dilemma as you. I had/still have the the Samsung ln46a650 and everything about that TV is still damn good. Especially if you're in an appropriately sized room I still got compliments in 2012 about how nice it was.  I agree about the Samsung quality. I gravitated towards the Sony's for picture quality, but upon research I learned about hdr and only two of their most expensive models have it and with the added bloated speakers. The price was just too much. Then I saw the 2014 model lg78ub9800. Image was so awesome but upon attempted 1080p input, up scaling sucked hardcore. Up scaling was much better on the sonys and samsungs with Sony probably doing it better.   I ended up circling back around to the samsungs. I really didn't like them last year but they either got better this year or chose better 4k sources. I still think they displayed a little bit too bright, unrealistic, and almost too sharp looking, but I settled for the 65js8500. The highest model flat screen and the cheapest HDR set. I think it's a good set the only downside is the clouding. I remember when I had the ln46a650 I was really blown away, and I think it's because lcd was in its later phases and so was well developed and the size is small so it displays 1080p great.  Also with a bigger tv, you're going to have more issues with clouding anyway so you have to realize it's a sacrifice that comes with upgrading. I'm content with the TV although it has that clouding fault. I would go with the 8500 because of the HDR and future proofing. Or I would wait a little bit for it to go down in price. There is a free phone deal upcoming and some cheaper promotions now that I cashed in on like free year Netflix. I got my model at bjs so I get the black rim and $100 m go (which not sure if it's worth it yet)  Edit: also 3d is awesome! And As for Vzio, I wasn't impressed with the color output of the models I saw in store....would be a downgrade imho coming from your current unit"

hometheater,3dsuj3,bradAHA,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:16:34 2015 UTC,"92,100,120 are all just popular sizes.  The size of screen has no real effect on the image. Ok well it does but only if your projector can't fill or get enough brightness on a particular size.  Going from 92 to 93 is not really changing anything.  Manufacturers just use those sizes because they aren't going to make every size imaginable.  The ratio can be anything and is independent of diagonal.  In general most are screens now 16:9 to match video content.  However 16:10 is a popular computer ratio.  Really you can have a 92"" 4:3 screen, or a 92"" 16:10 screen, or even a 92"" 2.35 ratio."
hometheater,3dsuj3,mistakenotmy,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:18:59 2015 UTC,"84"" at 6.5ft and it's great.  A small screen will have a slightly higher brightess, but if your room is light controlled it doesn't need to be a factor.  Note that you can adjust and get used to large screens. You can never get used to the regret of not going bigger :)"

Micro-dimming and such don't cut it in my book, which is why I say IPS sucks. OLED is still too expensive unfortunately. good panel uniformity (varies wildly with LCD), especially for black since that's when I would say the lack of uniformity is most noticeable - unevenness in dark scenes good motion clarity (also varies wildly)   Also hopefully everything else is in order, such as a properly calibrated mode (according to Rec 709 standards), but most non-shit TVs have a decent enough 'movie' mode or similar which is properly calibrated.

I did the above and it happened. Nothing plugged in at all and it did it. Stilled turns on amazingly even after the short and smoke.

If you want to tie them together your best option would be a sonos connect for your current receiver, and a sonos connect amp two power the outdoor speakers.

Parts are probably going to be a bit harder to come by on the Q97 if you need to repair it for any reason, but at this price point I would consider it a ""disposable"" investment, so if it goes bad, just recycle it rather than trying to repair it. Having said that, for $100 less and the newer version of HDMI, I'd probably personally go for the Q97HD. I would want to verify that it doesn't need any sort of power adapter to plug in to your wall."

hometheater,3dp46l,Ji-L87,2,Sat Jul 18 17:44:01 2015 UTC,"Audio shouldn't be affected, HDCP 2.2 is about copy protection, it dictates what content can be viewed and what cannot - and what you can do with it. Basically, it means that you run the risk of needing to replace whatever devices in the chain you have that doesn't support the HDCP 2.2 standard for things to work properly. Problem is that HDCP 2.2 is a pretty new standard, so the amount of devices currently out that support it is somewhat limited, although that will of course get better over time.  However that also means that in this transitional period where new versions of security protocols and connection standards are implemented, things are bit uncertain and complicated, and jumping on the 4K trend before it has a chance to get all the early kinks ironed out might be a risky thing to do.   Current 4K TVs are fantastic devices, many of them out there today are also great performers with normal 1080p content, however if you wish to use it to it's full potential you're likely to having to deal with HDCP 2.2 and HDMI 2.0/HDMI 2.0a at some point eventually."

You don't have a microphone because your receiver doesn't have an auto setup, you'll have to do it manually with test tones and an SPL meter. But to do that you'll need to get sound out of your speakers. How do you have them connected? You should have some speaker cable running from your receiver to them. There should also be some kind of a speaker setup menu that lets you tell the receiver how many speakers are connected, whether they're full or limited range, and play some test tones to set up your levels. I'd double check my connections and start looking for that before I did anything else."

hometheater,3doik8,tigervol,2,Fri Jul 17 23:19:27 2015 UTC,"The HEOS Drive looks pretty awesome!  I hadn't seen that before.  I will say - there is one big exception to networked audio systems like Sonos and HEOS being the best option, and that's if you've got a full home automation system.  With Crestron, you have a lot more flexibility to integrate some other systems than you do Sonos or HEOS.  Sonos is quite hostile about other devices controlling them.  HEOS could probably be made to integrate however you like, given enough time/effort in programming (assuming the API is open, which I believe it is).  The other time a traditional distributed audio system would be better is if you have non-network sources you want to distribute.  I've got a turntable that I will be running into my distributed audio system, as well as cable box audio.  I have also seen several situations where network audio couldn't be reliably streamed (believe it or not - I have no idea how people live where they can't get decent internet!), and FM/AM/XM tuners are used to provide the primary music sources.  Both of these are pretty fringe cases.  I will be setting up a more traditional distributed audio system sometime after I move - I've got an 8 input 8 output switcher/volume controller, and a 16 channel, 60 watt per channel amp.  Part of the reason I went with that over Sonos or Heos or the like is I'm a Crestron programmer, so it gives me better options to integrate it into the rest of my automation.  I can control it from my phone, tablet, computer, or a couple of different remotes/touch screens I have around the house.  The other reason is I only spent about $250 or so on the switcher and amplifier.  Less than the cost of a single zone of the new fangled stuff."
hometheater,3doik8,CNTP,1 point,Sat Jul 18 07:22:39 2015 UTC,"HEOS released their API about 5 or 6 months ago and currently integrates very well with Crestron, AMX, Control 4, etc.. - Most of these companies have their own audio options, but they don't give as much flexibility with source selection as you get with Sonos or HEOS.  Sonos has said before that they plan to ""open up"" their app a little bit and make it more friendly for integration with other systems. They have said that eventually they'd like to use the Spotify Connect functionality that HEOS uses, for example. Sonos integrates decently well with Control 4, although I actually prefer to just use the C4 app and Sonos app separately. HEOS is more tightly integrated into automation systems and is a much more seamless experience. I think that HEOS compliments a full home automation system very well, actually.  I have to disagree with you a bit on the non-network sources piece. Both Sonos and HEOS have audio inputs (HEOS providing analog and digital audio input options) to bring in traditional sources. You can plug up a CD changer, tape deck, and even a turntable as long as it has a built-in phono preamp or you purchase an external phono preamp. The zone that you plug that traditional source into can then digitize that source and share it wirelessly with the rest of the zones, giving you access to that content throughout the house.  I did mention in the post about these systems being very network dependent, but maybe didn't make a big enough emphasis on that. They require a strong internet connection for larger systems and a very good router or network setup in your house. I'm in the East Tennessee area and many of the systems I integrate go into areas in the mountains where, unfortunately, people don't have access to good/any internet, so I do still install some more traditional distributed audio systems in those environments, but when internet is not an issue, the networked option is almost always better.  Taking the FM/AM/XM tuner point... You're still relying on signal strength with those sources. There may be a radio station being broadcast from a little bit outside of your range that comes in, but is very scratchy and poor quality. Or you're listening to XM and the weather gets bad and your signal drops in and out. Using the networked devices, you can stream AM/FM/XM over the internet, meaning if you have an internet connection, your signal is coming in crystal clear. It also allows you to get AM/FM radio from outside of your area. So if you move, but have a favorite radio station from back home, you don't have to give that up.  From a cost standpoint, you have a compelling reason to choose the option you chose. I think for the average Joe that's not a Crestron programmer, the cost of the ""brain"" of the Crestron system along with programming expenses and paying closer to retail price on the hardware would make that option at least the same if not more than one of these other options. Maybe at some point, if you find a deal, you can get a HEOS link preamp for $350 (or less if you find one open box or used or anything - or if you can get dealer pricing from Denon) and integrate it with your system. That way you're still using the hardware you've already purchased, but you're expanding the amount of sources you have available to you exponentially."
hometheater,3doik8,CNTP,2,Sat Jul 18 11:17:47 2015 UTC,"I saw the audio inputs on the drive when I was looking at it after my post.  It actually does digitize them and broadcast to other zones as necessary?  That's great news.  The feature sheet I was reading didn't make that very clear.  As far as C4 offering Sonos drivers - I'm very cautious about using those on customer systems.  Like the RTI drivers for 3rd gen AppleTV's.  The manufacturer could break them with a firmware update, intentionally or unintentionally, and you're basically SOL until they update the drivers to fix it.  Not a risk I want to take, personally.  I looked at the HEOS module for Creston, and it looked very good.  I would want to add a few features to make it integrate better with our UIs and stuff, but it looks like that is a possibility.  I'll have to see if I can check one out more in depth, or just buy myself one, make it a source feeding my distribution system.  Regarding network, if you're distributing primarily local inputs, I'm assuming it won't use much WAN bandwidth?  I'm over in NC, and maybe 6 months ago I went to a house up in the mountains where the internet wasn't good enough to stream without the system occasionally buffering or dropping the stream.  But yeah, edge cases like that are about the only time I prefer traditional signals over internet streams.  And most homeowners understand if you tell them the satellite radio may go out in a big storm - they have likely experienced it with DirecTV before!  And yeah, I'm also an extreme edge case for Creston.  No way I could afford anything close to this if I didn't do this for a living.  I actually started putting together a squeezebox system a long time ago (before Sonos was a thing, or at least before it was big), and am still planning on using it as a source.  I'll look into getting a HEOS.  I can get it for dealer cost, will have to see if they do any accommodation pricing."

hometheater,3dnszu,CommanderZelph,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:54:29 2015 UTC,"If you have the room, all things being equal, a tower speaker will provide more bass (which can be very important in a 3.0 system) and even when coupled with a subwoofer will have a fuller, richer sounding mid-bass/mid-range.  That being said, choosing quality is more important than choosing form factor."
hometheater,3dnszu,000Destruct0,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:09:04 2015 UTC,"My room is fairly big.  The two I'm considering, and pulled from the guide, are the Infinity Primus set, which would run about $330 for the 3 front speakers with bookshelf.  The other set in considering are the Pioneer Andrew Jones with floor standing speakers which would run about $350 for the 3 front speakers."
hometheater,3dnszu,000Destruct0,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:20:47 2015 UTC,"Speakers are subjective but of those two I'd opt for the Primus speakers. You should try and listen to both though if at all possible, or at the very least any Pioneer Andrew Jones speakers and any Primus speakers to get an idea of the sound signature."
hometheater,3dnszu,kagoolx,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:27:11 2015 UTC,"After listening to a few, I might go with the Primus bookshelf speakers and then wait for the floor standing ones to go on sale.  Looks like They regularly drop to $100/ea on Amazon."
hometheater,3dnszu,kagoolx,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:39:17 2015 UTC,"I wondered the same thing when I was researching for buying mine.  Apparently, you can afford more ""sound quality"" for your money if you go for bookshelf.  I.e. £500 worth of bookshelf speakers should sound ""better quality"" than £500 worth of floorstanding speakers.  Floorstanding do provide more bass apparently, mainly due to the larger cabinet for the bass to resonate around, or something.  I went for floorstanding, on the basis that (a) I'm not getting a subwoofer and they will help fill that space bass-wise, (b) quite largely because they look really cool, and (c) partially because with bookshelf/standmounts, I sort of feel like I have to worry about them falling over or off their stands.  That's probably completely unfounded on the last point, but floorstanders just give me a better satisfaction of being stable, somehow.  So that was my decision, but with bookshelf you'll likely be able to afford a higher grade speaker for the same price, which might be more important to you.  Best bet is just to try a few pairs out at richer sounds or somewhere.  Also, check out second hand speakers on ebay, you can get a lot for your money second hand."
hometheater,3dnszu,ss0889,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:17:02 2015 UTC,Is it wrong of me to just assume everything on eBay and CL is just a knockoff?  I agree with your fears about the bookshelf a on a stand.  With 2 kids in terrified they will get destroyed.
hometheater,3dnszu,ss0889,2,Fri Jul 17 20:28:02 2015 UTC,"Ah yeah i'd worry even more if you have kids!  You should be fine with ebay - I originally was concerned about that but was reassured on here, and now I'd actually be very hesitant to buy brand new ones.  My worry was that I'd buy some second hand and then be forever concerned that maybe they didn't sound as perfect as they should, but not be sure!  What sold me on second hand was this:   Speakers do improve from one version to the next, but not as significantly as they depreciate.  I.e. 5 year old speakers will be only very slightly worse than the latest model, but will be a lot cheaper than brand new. Whatever your budget, you could therefore get better sound by spending the same money on a second hand pair of a higher grade.  I.e. budget of £500, you can either get a pair of £500 speakers brand new, or a pair of (originally) ~£900 5 year old speakers second hand, for £500.  The latter will sound better. Speakers apparently last for a long, long time without degrading.  So as long as there are no apparent damages, they should be as good as new. On the depreciation front, if you buy second hand and want to change in a year or two (or you just don't like them), you could sell them again for pretty much what you bought them for, back on ebay.  If you'd bought them new and wanted to do that, they'd now be worth about 2/3rds or 1/2 what you paid.  Almost like cars, most of the depreciation happens immediately upon first sale.  In my above example, if you'd spent £500 in either case, only the one you'd bought second hand would sell again for £500.  The brand new ones would be now worth £300.   The guy I bought mine from was great, packaged them up in the original boxes, explained all about the (very minor) cosmetic wear and tear, and threw in a pair of decent speaker cables.  Anyway, just my thoughts but you might well find yourself looking at second hand ones if you followed the same thought process that I did.  Best of luck!"

There are options out there but it really depends on what you're trying to accomplish.

The 4K is insane on the limited content available, and it upscales 1080P content really well. Understandably, 720P and 480P content look like dogshit, but when don't they? I have a couple of minor uniformity issues (some flash lighting and clouding), but it doesn't distract me enough to make it a big deal. Just be sure to get a good panel!  I also took the time to ""calibrate"" it using the Disney WOW discs, and it was definitely worth it. Very natural colors with deep blacks- not super saturated like on the JU7100. Motion has been great (I watched the Stanley Cup Playoffs and Women's World Cup). My Xbox One games also looks good.  The panel is also very bright, so in my family room that has a lot of direct natural sunlight, I am still able to see the TV!  For the money, I don't think I could have found a better TV. I haven't had any issues with the Android OS. I also haven't tried 3D on it yet, so I can't speak to that.  Is it a perfect TV? No- But for what I wanted, it's great. Looks high class hanging on my wall, has amazing colors, and performs well in direct light. Is it better than $2500-$6000 FALD TVs? Absolutely not, but in this price range for the PQ and features you're getting, it's definitely worth it. Blew the JU7100 out of the water in my side by side comparison (using the same video playing simultaneously).

hometheater,3dley6,Nevikao,3,Fri Jul 17 05:35:21 2015 UTC,You'll need a surround sound receiver. Check out Amazon for one. I recommend something from denon
hometheater,3dley6,mikenike192,2,Fri Jul 17 06:39:00 2015 UTC,You just need a 5.1 receiver. If you're not looking to spend much i would probably look into getting a Denon. All of your components (apple tv blur-ray ect) will run into the receiver and then you will have one HDMI run into your TV. You will use the receiver then to change your inputs and not the tv. You may also want to get a center channel to wrap it all together. this will give you all of your vocals.

It's literally 4 bolts into a solid material (like wood). If you have a drill the task takes 2 minutes - it takes longer to calculate size of screen, throw distance, and measuring out your centers.  What kind of screen did you order? If it's fixed frame, I don't think I'd do that for under $350. Those things can be a bitch to assemble, it took me about 2 hours to assemble mine.

Covered on page 29 - 30  SELF DIAGNOSTICS  To activate, press the front panel < ACTIVITY> + <CH DOWN > buttons at the same time and hold for 5 seconds. The STATUS LED will then flash denoting a two digit code. •  The number of flashes indicates the value of the MSD (tens digit) of the Error Code. •  The flashing then pauses for approximately 1/2 second. •  The LED then flashes indicating the value of the LSD (ones digit) of the Error Code. •  The Error Code is repeated a total of 5 times.Example: If the Error Code is “23”, the LED will flash two times, pause, and then flash three times.  Note:  The TV must be in “Shut Down” and the LED will probably be indicating an abnormal condition.If the TV is switched Off, AC is removed, or a System Reset is performed, the code automatically resets to “12” No Error. See the Error Code Log to retrieve a history of errors. Note: Use the front panel buttons, not the remote control. Note: If there is no response, the front panel may be locked by a V-Chip setting.

I am almost thinking that this is a processing power issue on the TV itself, since we can assume safely that the input is not actually 120hz from the source the mobo on the TV must perform this post processing on the image prior to displaying, and I am wondering if they did not bite off more than they can chew with that picture mode, that or the code is poorly optimized for what it is trying to do. Now having said that it is just a flicker at the top of the screen and always the same size across the top so it is safe to assume this is not due to the input device, and you said they actually swapped your tv for a new one so I would HOPE this eliminates a hardware issue causing it.   TL;DR  I would guess that this is an issue with the code for that particular picture mode straight from Sharp and the only thing to be done about it would be for them to release a firmware update for it."

If so, no worries there- as long as you have it run properly (drive rings in the attic, numbered) retrieving a slipped wire takes 2 people, a piece of fish tape and maybe 2 minutes of work. Have a person wiggle the wire up and down just below the drive ring in the attic while another feels inside the wall with the fish tape. It'll take a few swipes to catch it, but once you do just pull it right out.  As far as where you want it... measure twice, cut once. How will you be bringing it out of the wall?"

hometheater,3di5nh,agray20938,5,Thu Jul 16 18:34:12 2015 UTC,"I've always thought that in wall speakers were more for financially well off individuals that want a super clean setup. . . not necessarily the absolute best sound.       On that same train of thought, you need to be pretty convinced that specific in wall speakers are just the thing you want.  Bookshelf or tower speakers, on the other hand, are very easy to try out, or move to your next residence.  Also, speakers usually stick out some outside of dedicated HT rooms.  Just the nature of things.  Like, I know my own setup is not too pretty, but I'll gladly live with three speakers positioned around my TV considering how much better everything sounds."
hometheater,3di5nh,vfr4_nhy6,3,Thu Jul 16 15:34:04 2015 UTC,"To give a different look to this.... In wall speakers are hard to put in wall with an existing home. I can honestly say that the large majority of the theaters that I see, our customers tend to want in wall speakers. That being said the majority of our business is custom work when we can get in an pre-wire for in walls. People like how discrete the speakers are (especially with our acoustically transparent screens) they take up no foot print and still provide a decent quality especially when talking about just movies. If they were doing a lot of music I would definitely advise against it. Because quality and stuff."
hometheater,3di5nh,avnerd33,2,Thu Jul 16 17:25:58 2015 UTC,"As for the speaker size, if they're making a dedicated theater, they want good sound, very likely at reference volumes (close to theater, but as loud as the film-makers intend to watch.  Look up THX reference).  Good, reference sound cannot come from small speakers.  Those Bose cubes or HTiaB sets with 3 inch speakers? No chance at producing anything close to reference in any room.  Why?  High SPL needs one of the following: speaker cone surface area OR high excursions.  The killer is distortion.  It is FAR easier to get a larger speaker to play high SPL at low excursions with no distortion than it is to make a small speaker play high excursions at low distortion.  Ad that to the fact that small speakers cannot play lower frequencies.  If you want full frequency range (typically 20Hz up to 20,000Hz) You need a wide array of speaker sizes to do so effectively.  My home theater has a 12 inch horn sub (efficient and plays very low), my mains are a WMTMW combination of two 8 inch, two 5 inch, and a center tweeter, and my surrounds are MTM dual 5 inch and a tweeter."

On top of that in-wall speakers just aren't as good as free standing speakers.  Most buy more speaker than they need now as they expect to move into a larger space."

hometheater,3di5nh,GeckoDeLimon,0,Thu Jul 16 18:25:06 2015 UTC,In-wall/in-ceiling speakers are not ideal for home theater or anything else for that matter other than keeping the wife/girlfriend happy about not seeing speakers as much. The sound is usually horrible as they are tuned for an infinite baffle. The floor standing/box speakers are tuned to that enclosure and the sound is much more controllable and overall better.

It can get a bit hot, the fan can be audible during quiet scenes, and there is a slight rainbowing effect on bright objects on black backgrounds *if you're looking for it, but for the price, I can't complain.  Bumping the lumen output down has helped considerably with the rainbow effect, as well as training yourself not to flick your eyes all over the screen. I've also got a high gain screen, so i'd imagine a lower gain or grey screen would further improve things.  Pick whatever has the longest warranty I guess.  *[edit - the projector is not ceiling mounted - it's a ghetto job on our window sill, so is around a metre from our ears. properly located, it shouldn't be an issue]"

hometheater,3dfwac,faceman2k12,1 point,Thu Jul 16 09:47:56 2015 UTC,Incredibly detailed and while the towers themselves don't seem to exhibit any signs of distortion the room is currently untreated so although there are few reflections with the narrow dispersion the reflections that do happen are a problem at high volumes. I can play at an enjoyable volume without issue. They are unforgiving of really poorly engineered material but a lot of the stuff I listen to sounds pretty decent while well engineered stuff sounds like nothing I've ever heard. So worth the price tag.

Double check proper polarity on all the wiring but this should work okay enough given the quality of the components. If you bump into any questions pop into chat here www.powersoundaudio.com and we'll get it figured out quickly
hometheater,3dhujx,TVodhanel,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:30:43 2015 UTC,"Thanks! I will probably try that, I also forgot that he has his old amplifier so I might run a RCA from my receiver to AMP and then run speaker wire from the AMP to sub! Then decide which sounds better."
hometheater,3dhujx,TVodhanel,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:57:19 2015 UTC,I forgot to add...  1)if you wire it as described(In line) you need to set the receiver bass management settings to MAIN L/R = LARGE. SUB = no. Center and surrounds = SMALL/100hz.    2)If you use an external amp to power the subwoofer. Set all speakers to small/100hz. Sub to YES. And you will want to connect the subwoofer RCA output of the receiver to the input on the amp powering the sub

FYI blu-rays and cable will be completely obsolete soon, so good job for staying ahead of the curve. make sure any 4K tv has HDMI/HDCP 2.0 or 2.2 to stay ""future proof"". another nice thing to look for is a HDMI port that accepts a 60hz 4K signal (up from 30hz)"

hometheater,3dgysu,000Destruct0,1 point,Thu Jul 16 12:07:23 2015 UTC,Try to listen to them both and buy what you prefer. My local Best Buy has a Magnolia Design Center and they have both of these speakers on display. I went with ML over BW because I like how they sound in comparison and I too think the BW high frequencies can be very harsh and there is less detail in the midrange (at least for my 60XT's versus something like the CM10 S2)
hometheater,3dgysu,jrussell90,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:58:08 2015 UTC,I'm a Martin Logan dealer. Let me know what you need. I may be able to hook you up.
hometheater,3dgysu,Dr_Robot_Nick,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:13:31 2015 UTC,"The aluminum tweeter from B&W does tend to get a little harsh. The ribbon tweeter form ML tends to be a warmer sound. The CM1's will go down to 50hz where as the Motions 15's are rated to 60hz, so you'll get a touch more low end from the CM1's. the CM1's rate out at 84db and the Motions at 92db.   The Bowers are a very colorful speaker, they paint a very big open picture, and give what i would call a live sound. They will hit lower but you'll need a beefy amp to get there.   The Martin Logans, are very tight and precise. They give more of a studio feel because Martin Logan is very big on being able to hear every single detail, and you will be able to achieve this with less power.  I personally think the CM series is a lot more fun to listen to. They're very dramatic and tend to let the music rip through your body. Martin Logan is technical, precise, and to me a bit boring."

I think the furthest Ill ever go is 5.1 but that website you linked has some great deals. as long it has optical in and hdmi inputs and outputs then I'm good
hometheater,3dfz0j,StringBoi,2,Thu Jul 16 03:48:48 2015 UTC,"Yes, when you hook up your speakers and go into the Audyssey setup it will do test tones and you will configure what speakers you have connected.  It will then do EQ correction for your room as well as properly set all audio inputs to 3.0 or 3.1 if you have a sub.  I only use mine for 3.0 and it does it  absolutely perfect!"
hometheater,3dfz0j,StringBoi,2,Thu Jul 16 14:51:55 2015 UTC,that's really helpful thanks for the reply. I may get a sub later on and rear speakers too so that works out

hometheater,3dhfau,ZeosPantera,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:37:45 2015 UTC,I wouldn't recommend a projector unless you've got a dedication basement home theater setup with very little light. Having to close all the blinds and curtains whenever you want to watch something is not the most practical thing to do. However what I've seen people do is have a TV and a projector screen that can pull down in front of the TV screen when it's time to sit down and enjoy a movie
hometheater,3dhfau,greenturnedblue,3,Thu Jul 16 08:54:43 2015 UTC,"I disagree.  I have a 1700 lumen PTAE400 with 9x17 feet of window along one side.   I watch from sunset till later.   Projectors, except high lumen ones, are not good for day time viewing but if you are like most people that work during the day and like to do things during the day on the weekend not just watch movies they are fantastic."
hometheater,3dhfau,naturr,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:23:58 2015 UTC,"Having blackout curtains helps quite a bit, but in my own experience trying out a projector I'd go from thinking it looks good around sunset/late evening to, 'oh wait, now it looks great,' once it's finally dark out.  It was even more apparent testing around sunset using an HDMI splitter and comparing the same image on TV and projector.  They didn't match up favorably until the room was almost completely dark."

hometheater,3dggzi,PierreLunaire,3,Thu Jul 16 02:41:12 2015 UTC,"A/V installer here. We're based in France and we buy this nifty (and cheap) little device from Focal (the speaker manufacturer) that's called a HiLo. It's normally made for car audio, but we use it to transform the speaker out signal (left+right) into a 2.1 signal by adding a sub out.  The thing costs less than 30$ and it works like a charm. We use it a lot to connect 2.1 speaker systems with a powered sub to multichannel amplifiers that don't normally have a sub out.  Here's the device in question. I sorry, the page is in French, but I m sure if you contact Focal USA or search on Amazon, you'll find one.  It's a small metal box with wires sticking out that you connect to the speaker out on your amp, so the box receives an amplified signal, which it uses both to extract a sub out signal (to connect to your powered sub) and to power the box itself. All in all, it's about the size of a pack of cigarettes."

Now, to get back to your problem, it seems to me that the simple solution would just be to add back boxes (or back cans) to your existing in-ceiling speakers, so as to prevent sound leakage to the adjacent rooms.  Speaker back boxes come in various types, most of which are metal and can be filled with insulating material to further dampen the risk of leakage."
hometheater,3dhbo0,dfmz,1 point,Thu Jul 16 07:39:05 2015 UTC,Thanks for the helpful reply.      I'm trying to be very cautious because the three mains are directly under the kids' beds.  Maybe I'll experiment with boxes or cans on the rear speakers first and then go from there.
hometheater,3dhbo0,dfmz,2,Thu Jul 16 15:50:34 2015 UTC,"It's a good thing you mentioned that part about the kids' beds. From experience, I can tell it's very hard to completely subdue the sound from a speaker that is that close to a bed. You can add soundproofing material around the backbox, but even here in France where a lot of jobs happen in old buildings with thick walls, floors and ceilings, it's a problem.  To be honest, I'm not completely sure you'll remove the problem by attaching the speakers to the ceiling instead of putting them inside, especially if you're using backboxes.  If you can afford it or have access to it, now would be a good time to ask for acoustical advice."

hometheater,3dg6d7,wolfcry0,2,Thu Jul 16 05:40:40 2015 UTC,You need to research a lag less HDMI splitter (to use tv input for video and receiver input for sound at the same time) or buy a sound card whichever is cheaper (probably the sound card).  In general TVs don't pass surround sound codecs through their output. So 2.0 is all you're gonna get coming out of the TV.

If so, check your output settings in Windows when connected to the tv and make sure Dolby is enabled. Otherwise you'll have to run audio separately from the HDMI or look for a 4k compatible audio extractor and take the audio off the HDMI and send it to receiver separately.  A splitter likely won't work correctly unless it splits the audio only to a dedicated HDMI out, otherwise extraction or digital out from PC are your only options."

hometheater,3dglnd,Cat_Beans,4,Thu Jul 16 02:47:40 2015 UTC,You'll need a set of Samsung speaker wire. You should be able to find them on ebay or something if you Google the model number. One end will have those connectors that you see on your Blu Ray player and the other end will be open speaker wire.

If not out of your price range, I give my highest recommendation for a Hsu Research VTF-15H.  They just released the 2nd version of the sub so it should be even better than my current version which is exceptional.  I use it in a dedicated 500 sq ft home theater room and it really ""moves"" the room at about 1/3rd volume setting.  More importantly, it's really accurate down in the lower end so you definitely hear the difference between 40 hz and 45 hz."

It should go much deeper and simply have more power due much larger woofer size.  Again, my opinion is to push most of the resources into 1 setup, and then go cheaper on the other two rooms.  I think it's going to come down to budget, as the move you put into one room, the less you will have left for the other.  In essence, you are cutting your optimal room budget by 2/3rds by trying to equalize the quality of the 3 individual setups.  Don't forget the VTF-15H is pretty big, so you need some room for it.  I can post some pictures of my home theater room for reference if you like."

And I would get a bigger TV for one of the rooms, your already spending a lot so just find a 70"" in that price range.  You can get a Vizio 65"" 4k for $1800.

It also shows the screen size at those distances.  That will solve both questions

hometheater,3del9g,arockbiter,3,Wed Jul 15 19:31:36 2015 UTC,"First go here: http://www.projectorcentral.com/projectors.cfm  That is a great projector feature search. Enter the brightness, resolution, other stats you are looking for with the drop down menus.  Below the drop downs is a place to put throw information, so the 130"" diagonal and the throw distance.  The site will narrow down to projectors that fit those needs.  Now I just did that and found the Epson 8350 will do that.  See it specific throw calculator here.   Perfect right?  Not so much.  The 8350 gets great reviews over at /r/projectors but at its max throw distance the image brightness on the screen is going to be really low.  So even in a completely dark room you may have a dim image.  Is this for home or a business?  If this is for home I would look into a vaulted ceiling mount because most home units are not going to hit that (based on the quick look I just took).  Now if it is for business the Panasonic RZ370 is on the list that can hit that throw.  Great unit that is laser/LED based (super long lamp life 20k hours), great lens shift, built in HDBaseT, and 3.5k lumens, so also bright enough.  It is also a $3k projector. Great for buisness/schools but not really a home unit."

The tricky bit here is that projectors vary from model to model in terms of throw distance & image dimensions. In the industry there are special ""short throw"" projectors that are used for the opposite situation. I've not heard of a ""long throw"" unit that could handle such a distance. There ARE a bunch of mounts that are used for vaulted & high ceiling situations, so I'd wager that may be the approach to take, however other people on here probably have better advice..."

The problem isn't the Harmony, but that Harmony can only (as far as I know) communicate with the Roamio via IR, and the IR receiver on the Roamio sucks. So, you have to point the remote directly at the Roamio, or it doesn't work. I had to switch back to the Tivo RF remote because I couldn't deal with this issue anymore.

hometheater,3dd7fj,EMPIGYVE,3,Wed Jul 15 10:19:35 2015 UTC,"Hey there; fellow video/audiophile and bargain shopper here. I recently researched and purchased a 4k TV (Budget 1500; chose the 60 inch vizio m series). Price and size are the first two things that anyone looks at when shopping for TV's, but getting the TV that you really want is unfortunately not so simple. I am going to assume that you want out of a TV is to give you an immersive and realistic experience. TV's that are larger are considered to be more immersive than smaller ones but what really grabs you is the picture quality, more specifically contrast ratios, black levels and the ever-confusing ""motion rate"" (60hz 120hz etc.) First, cut the Seiki's 120hz in half; I would bet my bottom dollar that the 120hz is ""effective"" rate and not native. Native 120hz TV's are pretty expensive and are usually called 240hz because of backlight scanning effects that ""double the effective rate"". Confusing? yes it is! as a rule of thumb if you are looking at a budget TV it will be native 60hz because that is what the power coming from the wall is (in USA). What this means for you is that motion will be a tad blurrier than a more expensive model. not the biggest deal but just an FYI since you are shopping and more info is better. The backlighting is LED which 99% likely means edge lit (full array is something they will advertise); what this means for you in short is that the uniformity is brightness (especially with dark scenes in a dark room) will be okay at best. What you can be guaranteed by buying an edge-lit TV is that it will not be as bright as a backlit model. Some companies have done well with edge-lit tech but I wouldn't trust it from Seiki. By far the most important two stats on a TV are contrast ratio and black levels, which are to a degree, two sides of the same coin(NOT ""dynamic contrast"" or other B.S measures companies use; actual, lab measured contrast). To figure out how good these stats will be; research and forum searching is necessary but with regards to these, it usually is a situation where you get what you pay for. So let's say for argument's sake that you will be using it for mostly gaming and do not care about it being limited by the 30hz 4K HDMI port or backlight uniformity stuff or contrast/black levels; is it still worth it? NOPE. The nail in this TV's coffin is its limitations; if you are watching a movie, you will be stuck at 30hz. if you are using anything other than your computer as a source, there is no up scaling to 4K and no in-TV processing, which means it will look like a cheap 1080P model if you are not using a 4K signal. Even with a 4K signal, will you really benefit from having four times the pixels? Look at an image shot on a nice 8 megapixel camera versus one shot on a low end 16 megapixel one. the 8 megapixel one will always look better because of the richness and accuracy of colors. The same goes for TV's and I strongly suspect you will NOT find the immersive experience you are looking for with this Seiki. My advice is to get the best 47-55 inch you can for your $1,000. Look at Vizio, Sony and Samsung. LG has some serious issues with their lower end panels IMO so avoid unless you are going for full OLED curved, quantum blah blah blah tech.  Buy a direct backlit TV; if you go for 4K get one that supports 60hz and HDCP 2.0 (2.2 if you can find one) and make sure you get one that will upscale 1080P to 4K. With a good signal, this years model 4K's are quite good at using the extra pixels to your advantage even with a 1080 signal, which IMO is the most important feature given lack of 4K sources. As for recommendations; if your budget is 1,000 look for deals on last year's Sony 4k's, a 50 or 55 inch Vizio 4K or say forget it and buy a giant Sharp 1080P. You can get an AWESOME 1080P TV right now for almost nothing; if you can live without the extra pixels, then do it!"

My inital impulse was to suggest an compressor with an air-duster attachment used in combination with a vaccuum cleaner, but the more I think about it that'd probably blast more dust into your home theatre and that'd be a no-no."
hometheater,3d8u2q,PimpDaddyHD,13,Tue Jul 14 12:17:30 2015 UTC,"I thought of the air compressor and I'll do that before we laydown carpet and install equipment but after that, it's going to be as much of a dust free environment as possible. The Meile vacuum that we have is pretty awesome so I'm hoping I can just hit it with the brush attachment a few times a year. Keyword: ""hoping""  I'm mobile so I can't get all the pics uploaded but I posted some ""build"" photos to my instagram if you want to look through them.  https://instagram.com/leifhurst/  It's pretty much 4x4 dimensional cedar (3.5x3.5 actually) ripped length-ways into quarters. I tried to find pre-cut sections of it but it got REALLY costly. Each 1.75x1.75 (it's rough and that's something I would have done differently, the fence on the table saw kept moving) was cut into 3/8"", 7/8"", 1 3/8"" and 1 7/8"" blocks. After that we stained all the blocks (over 3,500). The backing board is two sheets thick of OSB laid in a cross pattern (there's window plugs behind it and they're cedar shuttered in the closed position on the outside). The backing board was stained and everything was affixed to the OSB backing board with liquid nails construction adhesive.  I played around with QRDude to get some rough dimensions but I couldn't go as deep with the wells that they had spec'd out so I fudged it a bit. I also laid them in a brick pattern (as opposed to a tile pattern) to combat my blocks being +/- 10% in size. I would say it's 70-80% effective based on the original QRDude calculation. To me as long as it cut some echo out of the back of the room and looked cool, I was happy. The room we build in the last house had some MAJOR echo in it (so much so that I ended up just absorbing the whole back wall) so I thought I'd give a good diffusion wall a try.  The whole project cost me about $300 USD and I spent maybe 30 hours on it (20% cutting, 40% staining, 40% gluing). I did get through 5 books on audible. LOL  Things I would have done differently. * check my fence on the table saw * ran every ripped piece through the table saw on the adjacent side to truly square them off * stain the wood before ripping (this would have stained 2 out of the 5 needed sides for me)  I struggled if I would have painted the room first and then blocked or blocked and then painted. If I blocked the wall first I would have stained it in place but I thought cutting this in while painting would have been a huge PITA."

hometheater,3dc5uh,samalex01,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:07:06 2015 UTC,"We are having a home built, and our builder is prewiring for 5.1 surround sound with ceiling speakers. He's not doing the speakers though, just prewire. Problem though is the company doing the wiring doesn't seem to have much A/V experience, or at least the person I'm working with doesn't, so I'd like some guidance from the group.   Firstly they're installing what looks like an electrical box in the ceiling where the speakers will go, and they said I'd need to cut out a hole large enough for the speakers when we install them. Will this be an issue if the junction box is attached to a stud?  I'm attaching a graphic of the basic layout and where I can imagine the speakers going, but again I'm no expert so I'd LOVE some advice. The ceilings are 9 foot tall, and this is a two story house. This is why I really want to get the speaker position correct for the prewire, because if it's wrong there's no redoing it. Also just to get a better idea of the layout of the house I'm attaching a picture of the bottom story of the house from the builder. Sorry the images are flipped from one another, but hopefully this helps. Also the TV will be centered on the wall at about 10.25 feet from either wall (wall is about 20.5 feet).  Also what type of speakers would you all recommend for such a setup?   Thanks for any advice. I need to get this to the builder by tomorrow, but I'll try to stretch this out as far as i can because I'd like some advice outside of what I've learned from reading the forums or Googling."

hometheater,3dc5uh,sipsyrup,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:06:48 2015 UTC,"I just put in in-ceiling speakers in my home for a 5.1 setup. I had to deal with the gangs in the ceiling exactly how readinthedark's video link demonstrates. No one here will recommend them, because you don't want the audio to come from above you. I found a way to mitigate this affect by getting Def Tech UIW RCSIII for my Front L&R, since they have a 45 degree angle to better point the sound at you, instead of at the floor. My rears are Speakercraft Aim7 Threes which have a 15 degree angle, which was enough to point at the couch where I sit.   I love my system, but it's tailored to work for me. I'm not an audiophile like most people here. You're still going to be compromising for a worse sounding system where your speakers are nicely tucked away in the ceiling.   edit: If you do go through with getting it wired, you might as well add a couple of wires to go to the left and right of the couch so you could easily upgrade to a 7.1 system."
hometheater,3dc5uh,sld87,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:14:51 2015 UTC,"You won't want ceiling mounts unless you are doing a 5.1.2 setup (Atmos). Otherwise, if you have to compromise (and can only do 5.1) then you are better off attaching them to the wall adjacent to either sides of your ear when listening. You can also further compromise by mounting them up higher.  I just pre-wired my 7.1.2 atmos setup and had to mount the surrounds (back 4) almost at roof height because of doorways and windows. The good news about surround speakers are they are just for background ambience, not really the meat and potatoes of your HT."
hometheater,3dc5uh,Readinthedark,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:47:42 2015 UTC,"We are in the building phase of our home also.   Is their a way you can at least have them prewire your front speakers on the front wall so you can have floor standing speakers (not inwall or on wall)?  In ceilings for the fronts is not a good idea, imagine dialogue from the center channel directed down and over you rather than at you.  If it were my house, I would pay the nominal upgrade fee to do it correctly when you are at this stage of build.  It will be hard to figure out where a sub should go right now so you could have them wire it to one of the corners or opposite corners.Many tract home builders do this kind of ""surround"" sound wiring, but its mainly to list it as an upgrade, and is not very functional. Where are all the wires going to?  I would run a conduit from where you expect to mount your TV to your media cabinet.  If it were me, I would put it in the office next to your family room."

Alternatively, buy one on Amazon and return it if it doesn't work for you. You most killed won't find the exact same model for rent, but a comparable model in terms of resolution and Lumens output will give you an idea of the end result.  As a last resort, you could go the short-throw way. Short-throw projectors sit at the base of the screen and project the picture upwards. They make amazing ones nowadays that work really well including for big-ass screen sizes, but they do have one drawback: they're expensive.  But they're kick-ass. And expensive. But really cool too. Your call. ;)"

That would only leave me with <13 feet from that 7ft wall.  From what ive been reading if the benq w1070 is 12' away from the wall the screen would need to be 126"" diagonal. That could potentially work but I haven't actually been back to the house to measure out a 126"" screen. I have a feeling it may get really close to the ground and be awkward.  I did hear there may be a way to shorten the throw or get a specific projector that has a short throw distance but not sure what I would be looking for."

(Kind of an awkward statement since the calc seems to be intended for you to pick your screen size first, and make changes to the zoom and throw distance second)  My room is roughly the same as the part of your room you outlined, though I've got closer to an 8' height ceiling. I'm going with the Benq w1070 and a 120"" screen. I don't have them yet so I couldn't tell you how well it's going to work out, but I've measured everything and it seems it will work out.  The W1080ST is the short throw version of the W1070, using the same zoom and throw range, the screen size is 199"" diag. Obviously meant to be put closer - to reach the same 110"" screen, you could put it anywhere between 5'6"" and 6'7"" (you can pick W1080ST in the calculator as well)."

Sorry if it seems common sense lol"
hometheater,3dcc71,lituus,2,Wed Jul 15 11:49:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah just recommendations based on ambient light I guess. The closer the brighter, and they recommend brighter for when you have a lot of ambient light so the image isn't/is less washed out. Up to you to decide if you care about that but as I understand it the projector should be able to handle the entire throw range shown there."
hometheater,3dcc71,sleepybeagle,1 point,Wed Jul 15 12:59:18 2015 UTC,"Just to clarify...  So using that calculator, if I bought an 84-inch screen, I would need to put the project 9 feet and 2 inches away from the screen for the throw to fill the full 84-inches, right?  With the zoom function, could I put it 13 feet away and then reduce the image size to 84 inches with the zoom?"
hometheater,3dcc71,lituus,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:48:53 2015 UTC,"84"" screen puts the throw range at 7' to 9'2"", so anywhere in there with tweaking the zoom setting. 7' would need the maximum zoom of 1.3x, 9'2"" would need no zoom.  It appears that you could not have it project an 84"" screen at 13' away. 13' throw can do screens 120"" to 156""."

The Samsung's speakers are basic and if you're watching a bunch of movies or playing a bunch of games a soundbar or 5.1 setup is recommended. If you don't want to dish out for speakers, the Sony's built-in ones will do just fine. Also, if you want more bass, you can purchase a small Sony sub that pairs up with the TV via a really thin wire. Also note that the wedge design adds considerable bulk and heft to the TV, so if you're wall mounting it and want a low-profile look it might not be the best option.  In terms of picture quality, both TVs are stunning. A couple of main differences I could point out are that the Samsung does amazing vibrant colours that make everything pop. Sony does more subdued, natural-looking colours very well. It looks a lot closer to a calibrated TV than the Samsung does, so if you want more evened out tones with better contrast and to potentially see more detail in dark scenes (important in gaming!) the Sony is the better choice. Also, when it comes to refresh rate, the Samsung outputs at 240Hz while the Sony does 120Hz. The difference between the two refresh rates are not huge (you only really need to be worried when its 60Hz) and both TVs have engines that digitally enhance the refresh rate anyways, so this isn't a huge point of difference between the TVs.  I think the Sony is a better option for you. It's a TV that focuses on giving you the best picture possible without the added frills of a fully-featured Smart TV which gives you the same features you have on your PS4. The Sony is a better cinematic experience in terms of sound and picture quality, and you'll save money/hassle by not having to get your TV calibrated to get that natural contrast and detail. I hope this helps you make a decision!"

Projectors don't just start up at full brightness.   What about on screen displays?  Most projectors will give a manufacurer name plate during startup (think giant blue screen with ""Panasonic"", Epson, Acer, etc. emblazoned on it) and generally a source indicator (HDMI 1, PC, Video, etc.).   Are all the projectors LED?  If not the lamp based units will not start back up for a number of minutes after a hard power loss. Even the LED's may have a delay.   What is the video source?  I might be worried about the video source freaking out when it sees a display just show up and disappear at random.  I guess that is more if a computer is driving the projector.    Here is what I would look at instead:  Use a relay to activate a hardware shutter to block/unblock the projector lens.  Then you don't have to worry about powering on/off the projector."
hometheater,3db8op,mistakenotmy,2,Tue Jul 14 23:18:58 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your reply!  I should clarify, the installation is permanent and the projectors will be turned on and off in the morning/evening each day. So the logo and warm-up time are not a problem, they won't be going on and off while viewers are there.  They will just be in hard-to-reach areas, so we want them to power on when an employee comes in and flips a main switch and the relays power everything on.    Luckily right after posting this I did find some projectors with this functionality.  Optoma ML550 and ML750 are LED pico projectors that have direct power on features!"

hometheater,3db5eg,svirbt,2,Tue Jul 14 22:55:33 2015 UTC,"You'll want to make sure your equipment space is properly ventilated. Ideally you would only extract hot air and have it dampered off if you run heating plus regular exhaust for generated heat.  I'd suggest a free standing rack or one on wheels unless you're comfortable wall mounting or building wall for rack rails.  Plan your trunk line into the room, pros will use patch panels to link trunk to rack, but depending on placement it's not uncommon to run your trunk line into the rack or have an umbilical cord to roll the rack off the wall or even feeding a stationary installation.  There are vent panels and fan/temp controlled gear to help manage heat and airflow. Middle Atlantic is generally the industry gold standard but there are a ton of other manufacturers that make stuff just as good. Some manufacturers will offer rack ears for their gear, that's usually the best option. Otherwise get a shelf rates for the equipments weight."

I've been poking about google and it seems like there are some issues of running HDMI out of your video card to a receiver can give windows 7 fits if you turn off the receiver.   Like every time it goes off and then back on you need to reconfigure the sound in windows.  And to throw a wrench in the whole affair I have a headset I sometimes use for multiplayer gaming.  Its presently using optical but does have sterio input and its mic is via USB.     I have:  Nvidia gtx 970 video card, which has 1 hdmi port.    I have a soundblaster Z sound card that has the standard PC combined outputs, headphone jack, and S/PDIF in and out.    I read somewhere trying to pipe 5.1 along optical isn't as high quality as HMDI.    I hear in receiver's line-level analog inputs are all but a dead technology so it sounds like I have to digitally input the sound singal.    Would the Dennon hooked up to HMDI still be a good solution?"
hometheater,3danyv,whiprush,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:22:32 2015 UTC,I have my PC (on-board HDMI port w/AMD APU) hooked up to my receiver. I never have to reconfigure anything. I have a Marantz receiver which is sister brand to Denon.   I would imagine you'll have to continue to use the headset via the sound card.
hometheater,3danyv,whiprush,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:34:59 2015 UTC,"The stuff you're googling is out of date.   It's 2015, you can ditch the soundblaster, the optical cable (Spidf) and the headphone jacks and just output 5.1 audio from your GTX 970 to your receiver. I've been doing this with nvidia cards for a while and that all has always just worked out of the box.   All you need is hdmi out for your video/audio to your receiver (unless you have a gsync monitor) and for multiplayer games you need a USB from your PC to your headphones. Old headphones have 3.5 inch plugs and USB, modern ones have only USB; that's probably what you need.   Since you mention that a typical AV receiver is too huge, an alternative for you might be just HDMI out for the monitor, and then a USB 5.1 headset, which are available from a variety of manufacturers. You'd have HDMI out for video and USB for surround audio, real simple.   I don't have any experience with these and the idea of surround headphones makes me cringe, but apparently some people really dig them and it might be a cheaper upgrade with better sound if you don't have the room for a proper 5.1 av receiver. The nice thing is you can get a set and try it and if it doesn't work then return the headset, then consider going balls to the wall with a proper receiver.  Hope this helps!"

Posts I saw were from 2014 so I dind't know if drivers had matured to behave better.    Seems like you would have to reconfigure your sound if you powered off the receiver.

It sounds like what's happening that if Windows has two sound devices, and it defaults to HDMI, and it notices there's no signal there it switches to the optical so sound works.

What makes these special is that they are mastered in a higher resolution (2160p) and then rendered out in a lower resolution (1080p) to make it way easier for the upscaling engine to do its job.  Very similar to Supersampling. It results in much higher quality image even though it is still at 1080p.
hometheater,3dal3i,Arayoth,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:13:42 2015 UTC,"Ok just to clarify, you said it makes it easier, but does it make it LOOK better?"
hometheater,3dal3i,Arayoth,2,Tue Jul 14 20:24:01 2015 UTC,"The only ones I have are Elysium and Chappie, and to me, it looks as close to 4K content as it'll ever get without actually being 4K. It's phenomenal. I'm playing it through a Sony bluray player that upscales to 4K.  What I'm not sure of is whether the Sony discs work better with the Sony upscaling engine. I have a Samsung js8500, I don't know if it would look different using the upscaling on the tv because it's from Samsung.  Edit: Just to clarify, I just realized I'm an idiot and could have just answered in a much easier way. The upscaling engine has more detailed information to work with so it looks better because the source is better."
hometheater,3dal3i,DivinityCycle,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:30:20 2015 UTC,Awesome. I'm glad to hear there is a noticeable difference.
hometheater,3dal3i,redberyl,0,Tue Jul 14 21:35:26 2015 UTC,"I feel like you have no idea what you're even asking, which is why you mention ""the upscaling abilities of the tv.""(sic)  Just to clarify, at this point in time most displays are 1920x1080 (AKA ""1080P""). The standard resolution for BluRay video is also 1920x1080. When you're watching a 1080P BluRay on a 1080P screen, there shouldn't actually be any ""upscaling"" necessary, as you've got a 1:1 mapping of the video pixels to the display pixels. Basically, ""upscaling"" is irrelevant when talking about ""4K remastered"" BluRay discs.  Much like 3D and other video technologies, various products turn in various levels of quality. The guys over at Blu-Ray.com's forums generally have big discussions about these kind of releases, and usually a 4K remastered version of a BluRay is somewhat better than the original BluRay release. That said, often times the first gen BluRay releases were done back when BluRay was new and so those releases had other quality issues that got corrected by doing a ""modern"" remaster.  An example would be RoboCop which got a 2007 release and then recently got a 4K remaster. Review here: http://www.blu-ray.com/movies/RoboCop-Blu-ray/89781/#Review  Basically, evaluate on a case-by-case basis, but generally a lot of the 4K re-releases are great looking.  In terms of ""4K Mastered"" releases for modern titles like Chappie, its effectively meaningless marketing hype. Is there a ""non 4K Mastered"" version of the movie to compare it against? Is there even a different version you can buy? Nope!"

Streaming live sports on the fire stick is really meh. Genesis works pretty well though, pulls streams from lots of online sites and lets you pick from them in an organized manner. Kinda funny this guy selling this considering it takes less than 30 minutes to do yourself, following youtube tutorials.  Not that I am saying to use these illegal streams, but if you were going to, please go for the real Amazon Fire TV box so that you can hardwire in with ethernet (even without illegal streams, you want best internet for a media device). It's kind of a legal grey area for streaming (although definitely unethical), I've read in the past that as long as you are 100% streaming and not downloading the file & also not showing it to a public group it's not breaking the law.   Willful intent to access an illegal stream + downloading and/or distribution is what is illegal, can't prove the first part unless a site is clearly stating ""by accessing this stream you acknowledge it may be copyright infringement"". Honestly if you have the money just pay for your content, most media is pretty easily accessible nowadays. In situations where people don't have cable subscriptions and want HBO, and hbo now makes it limited to apple products only, they're kind of asking for game of thrones to be claimed the #1 pirated show (hbo let me pay you and not comcast for your content)."

Finally, I went in and messed with the brightness and a few other picture settings. With the brightness turned all the way down, there's no effect - the TV stays on. Interestingly, when I went and reset everything back to the previous settings, the TV also stays on. Maybe just messing with the power settings reset something?

hometheater,3d5hjz,TactFully,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:20:48 2015 UTC,"Depends on how stealthy/small the satellites have to be? I'm for quality over quantity so for $300 you'd see me rolling with 3x HVL-1. 3.0 because center is much more important than sub for TV/movies and the bass on decent bookshelves is satisfactory enough for me. Not more than 3.0 because I'd have to sacrifice quality on L & C & R for adding sub/surrounds.   If it must be smaller, I'd do 2 pairs of MB42x (L&R and surrounds - $160) and the matching center ($80) or you could do an Infinity setup (P153 or 143 for small size, and matching center) or the Pioneer setup (BS22 etc.)"
hometheater,3d5hjz,TactFully,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:31:07 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your suggestions.    The speakers would also have a lot of duty for listening to music as well.  the Hvl-1's are just too big but the MB42x's may fit the bill just fine.    Seeing how they would get a lot of use for music too.  would you do a pair of MB42x's plus sub?   I'm just wearing that there wont be any bottom end with two small speakers like that.    edit:  reading more about those mb42x's... They seem like the answer to my problem.  all the reviews are glowing.  i generally don't put much value into amazon reviews with audio gear, but with 350+ reviews... they have to be pretty good"
hometheater,3d5hjz,CLEBB,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:48:20 2015 UTC,"The MB42x have very reasonable bass extension, surprising given their size and price. A lot of it is going to depend on the size of your room, the peaks and nulls which are going to be created by the room - and whether your listening positions are in some nasty null spot(s), the quality of your amplifier (and even more so, if it has something like Audyssey's Dynamic EQ to compenasate for human's reduced sensitivity to bass), etc.  You could start with just 2.0 and see how it sounds for a few weeks, then decide from there."

I live in europe and hbo doesn't seem to be an option for me.

hometheater,3d6qz3,dms193,2,Mon Jul 13 23:27:16 2015 UTC,"Congrats on getting started with HT. Welcome. You've selected a solid receiver there. Yamaha is a good choice. Be mindful that model 475 has been discontinued. That might help you save a few bucks, but the Yamaha RX-477 is the 2015 model - if that matters to you.  I've personally never heard the Chane brand of speakers so I can't speak to their sound or build quality. I do know they're a very small company sold only over the internet. My personal preference is for more established mass-produced speakers, just for the ease of warranty stuff BUT if they give you a pleasant sound at the right price, man that's all that really matters. Now when it comes to going L-C-R while waiting for rears....personal preference speaking here, if you're going piece by piece I say do the center channel last. Why? Because the rears are what makes surround sound surround. I feel 4.0 is a better option while getting started. Your L/R will give you a front soundstage already, go for the rear.  About the subwoofer. Adding a subwoofer to my system changed everything for the better. I'm in an apartment as well and my solution to be a good neighbor was to use these trusty Auralex Subwoofer Isolation Pads to keep the subs off of the floor. As an apartment dweller, all of these speakers are isolated from the floor and walls. Makes a huge difference. Good luck with your system!"

But, I guess i'll find out for sure when I get them. I think you have a good point on the upgrade path (waiting to do the center last). I guess one of the reasons I had originally planned on picking up the center now is that its on sale for about $30 off its normal price which was enticing.   Thanks for the recommendation on the isolation pads, those look like they will do just the trick! What sub are you using in your setup and would you recommend it?

I recently added some LED bias lighting set behind a black frame / backdrop to make it really standout (and cover the cable conduit). I cant believe how much of a difference it's made to the experience....my wife feels it's a little dramatic for the living room, but tolerates my enthusiasm anyway. We have the lighting set to a soft-white glow when watching the TV, which gives a beautiful ambient glow to the room, but can set it to Disco mode for the kids if need be.  60"" LG 3D Smart TV with a Denon Receiver powering Wharefedale Valdus 5.1 bookshelfs & sub."
hometheater,3d2cjt,altxatu,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:44:17 2015 UTC,"I like to watch movies and TV in the dark, or as dark as I can make it. I like the idea of the colored bias lighting, so I'm curious what you think? I noticed you said red wasn't real good. I would think that red would be good for a dark environment as it doesn't effect your night vision, but it's harsher than blue light. I like the blue and would prefer the calming effect. What do you think?"
hometheater,3d2cjt,Daneth,4,Mon Jul 13 00:41:14 2015 UTC,"The red and blue look great, but can tend to distort the natural colour tone of the movie a bit, that's why the soft white is a better option as it's far less distracting.  The concept behind bias lighting is that it gives a stable light source in the room so that you're eyes are not constantly adjusting to the bright / dark images on the screen.  It's also nice to have some light in the room, particularly when you are watching a movie with young kids.  Having the lighting behind the TV ensures that you wont get any reflection on the screen, meaning the black levels of the image are as dark as possible. Lights shining onto the TV just tend to wash the blacks into a dull grey."

hometheater,3d3v3i,Joncat84,2,Mon Jul 13 16:05:39 2015 UTC,Your crossover setting aka bass management determines what frequencies skip your speakers and go to your sub. Your sub normally plays lower frequencies then your speakers and can do so louder. Your speakers can play down to 90hz so you want your crossover set to 90 or above or else sound will be sent to the speakers that can't be played.   Running audyessy will do this automatically.

hometheater,3d3f5q,quartervoss,2,Mon Jul 13 05:17:23 2015 UTC,"Well I've never personally done this, but this is how I would do it.  First of all, that is a tiny TV. ;)   Second, to do this right, you're gonna want to build a frame like a deck. Just raising it at the four points is going to be unstable and dangerous. So a platform is in order. You're gonna want to get several (2 x whatever height you want to raise the couch) and frame them up like this. You'll have to figure out the dimensions to determine how many boards to get but I would space them about 12-18"" apart in the middle. Then get a piece of plywood to put on the top that is the same dimensions as your frame.  As far as protecting the floor I would just throw a rug underneath with the anti slip rubber stuff so it doesn't slide.   Or just a cheap piece of carpet if you don't care how it looks. Likewise, if you don't want just a bare wood platform, you could carpet it. Or paint/stain it to closely match the color of your floors.  Hope that helps/answers your question."

Put subfloor on the top and make the ligs from 2x6 long enough to get the couch up where I wanted it.  I also made a fwd platform and a couple steps since Mine is up about 12 inches.

The universal soundbar mount pretty much accomodates every sound bar on the market and is relatively inexpensive.

I have heard that you have to break a speaker in....I never really believed it.  Im still not sure that I do but after a while the Klipsch speakers seemed to sound better and better to me....Im not sure if they got broken in or I just adapted to their sound but I am more than happy with them now.
hometheater,3d2rv6,guess_twat,2,Mon Jul 13 03:48:17 2015 UTC,There's no such thing as speaker break in...that's a marketing trick to keep the speakers in your home past the 30 day return policy. It only takes a few bass notes to upen up a speaker and maybe a couple minutes for a subwoofer.  You adapted to their live sound.

They were correct that for long term a pieced together system is a better investment than a HTiB. Do you want towers? If so there are many towers better than those Yamahas. For that amount of money I'd opt for either Infinity Primus P363 towers spend a little more for Chane A3rx-c towers.   If you do not insist on tower speakers then I'd recommend Chane A2rx-c or a pair of Martin Logan Motion LX16 speakers.

Although the Best Buy employee told me the same thing, it was an employee that worked at a dedicated home theater store that told me it wouldn't work long term, he did explain why but it was a lot of technical terms and numbers that didn't stick with me.  The main thing I want to avoid here is if I buy a new receiver to go with my old speakers, the receiver will go on me relatively quickly, and I'll just have to buy a new receiver and speakers, effectively wasted several hundred dollars.  The old speakers are unpowered and have subs built into them, and use regular speaker cable. Both employees told me that the amount of power they draw would fry the receiver in a year, maybe two."

Do that and you have the real deal that a couple guys from Ascend modeled the HVL-1 after: The 170 SE.    I'm confident you'd be happy with the HVL-1's (they're decidedly not boom-sizzle type speakers, and have excellent mids), but, since you have the budget (and they're on sale too), you could get the 170 SE's, which are an upgrade all around from the Wavecrests.

hometheater,3d0oyc,Raptorz69,3,Sun Jul 12 15:11:30 2015 UTC,I'm not as well versed as most in this sub but from what I've read is that the insulation in the walls will help the sound from escaping the room but won't help the acoustics in the room.   The drywall will just reflect the sound as it's not acoustically transparent and you will need wall treatments to help.  So if you want to stop sound from escaping then insulate the walls. Roxaul will be your best bet.   If you want better sound in the room you will need to look at putting up something on the walls to trap the sound and not reflect it.
hometheater,3d0oyc,WayNorth,1 point,Sun Jul 12 15:29:01 2015 UTC,"Some questions:   Is this a single family home, or a row home with neighbors? Do you want to isolate the home theater noise from the rest of the house (and potential neighbors)? Are there loud components on the outside of the theater (like an HVAC unit) that you do not want to hear inside the home theater?   If you answer single family/no to all of the above, don't bother. If you do want to isolate noise, fiberglass insulation isn't actually going to help much with tradtionally framed walls: http://www.tmsoundproofing.com/effect-of-insulation-in-the-common-wall.html  If you want to truly isolate sound (especially low frequency) the best thing you can do is use Whisper Clips. This basically spring loads the drywall on the inside so that it absorbs all the vibration from the speakers but doesn't transmit it back to the studs to propagate through the house. The next step after that would be the Green Glue compound and double layering drywall on top of the Whisper Clip system. This can get pretty costly though, but there's no better time to do it if you have your studs exposed."
hometheater,3d0oyc,zim2411,1 point,Sun Jul 12 17:30:05 2015 UTC,"Ok thanks, this is what I wanted to know. I have a single family home and just wanted to know if acoustics inside the room would be affected. Most of the walls are going to be up an inch away from the concrete foundation anyways."
hometheater,3d0oyc,zim2411,1 point,Sun Jul 12 17:38:22 2015 UTC,"Yeah, insulation in the wall won't affect acoustics in the room, beyond maybe reducing a little bit of resonance from the drywall itself."
hometheater,3d0oyc,legolad,1 point,Sun Jul 12 18:27:40 2015 UTC,"Yep. Insulating all the walls - internal and external - will help isolate the room more from external noise and isolate other rooms from you theater. Same for floor/ceiling insulation if you have rooms above or below.   That said, you can add additional isolation by using some special drywall techniques that isolate the drywall from the framing if the house. Search for info on drywall sound isolation.   Once isolated, you can take steps to shape/manage the sound of the room you've created. What those steps should be will depend on several factors:   the surfaces in the room the furniture in the room the placement of speakers the budget you have for sound improvements   I don't know the theory or science behind this well enough to lay out all the steps. But there are lots of online resources.   In general, a completely dead room won't allow the sounds from your system to bounce around at all. A room that is too alive will bounce sound around until it turns to mud. This is where the art meets science. The science helps you measure the behavior of sound in your room, but it can't tell you if it sounds good. Only you can do that.   I've seen lots of contradictory advice about this topic and I don't know if there is a right answer. But here is what worked for me.   I finished my room, furniture, window coverings, shelving, everything.   Then I used the auto-setup on my Yamaha rxz7. Then I listened.   I listened from several seats to several sources. My focus was on surround with some stereo thrown in. I took notes about what was weak or muddy or ill defined.    Mostly it was fine. But there were some times when elements of a film were lost in the back channels. Using the the individual volume controls for each channel I was able to find settings that worked well enough for me.   As I've used the room over the last several years I've found that there is still some muddiness which I assume is caused by some reflective cabinetry I have at the back. I've considered buying some acoustic tiles to put on the cabinets but it hasn't been a priority for me.   Hope this helps."

hometheater,3cymm8,Mutemath_Fan,1 point,Sat Jul 11 23:34:41 2015 UTC,"It depends what the problem is. It may be and easy fix, or not. I'm no expert (emphasis on this), but when my receiver starting doing the same, losing a channel, I inadvertently fixed it when I lifted it up to grap a cable under it and dropped it back down, pretty hard. The channel popped back in and has been fine ever since. It wasn't the speaker cable connection, I do believe there was a short or something loose somewhere inside. I just got lucky there.  Around the same time, the same receiver shut down one night and wouldn't turn back on, returning a DAC error on startup, and I spent days trying to figure it out, googling, hard resets, special menus. I finally decided to check out some general youtube receiver repair videos, there are tons of them, and I got familiar with my cheap multimeter, which I've hardly used since getting free from Harbor Freight.  I took the chassis off, and started checking the DC voltages where ever I could. I quickly found that the 18v traces weren't carrying 18v, more like 9v, so I followed the traces and cables back to the power supply board where I discovered the power supply was making the 18v, but it split off on two different paths and they both went through these little fusible resistors, however my lovely little multimeter showed me that one of those paths was losing the voltage at the resistor, so I unsoldered it, checked the resistance with the MM, and it was out of spec. Long story made a little shorter, downloaded the service manual for my reciever, found the type of resistor to buy, spent a couple bucks at Digi-key, and got my reciever working again.   It's possible, but maybe not easy, and definitely can be frustrating if you're learning at the same time, like I was. But I did learn something, I'm more confident in my ability to at least learn how to fix something, and I of course didn't have to shell out the big buck for another receiver. Maybe yours is an easy fix though."

hometheater,3czeog,Scardaddy,1 point,Sun Jul 12 07:14:11 2015 UTC,"I have one of the ioGear devices you linked, and it works.  I'm not sure where you got your info about HDMI cables not working over 50'. They work over that range but they need something to boost the power of the signal.  My suggestion would be a HDMI switch and an active 100' cable.  Cable: http://www.amazon.com/BlueRigger-Cable-Built--Signal-Booster/dp/B005LJQNAG/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1436682435&sr=8-2&keywords=hdmi+100ft  Switch: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00579MDT0?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_search_detailpage  I suggest those as I can confirm I have used both and both work as they are advertised together.  There are cheaper options on the market but I can not confirm they work together.  I suggest this over the wireless solution as the box tends to drop the signal every once in a while, especially if there is a lot of movement between the transmitter and receiver.  It is also susceptible to drop out from wireless noise, ie cell phones and computers.  Therefore it's not really practical in the type of space you are talking about with lots of people walking around.  The industry standard would be to use cat5e/6 over HDMI.  The usual reason for that is that cat5e is cheaper then HDMI over runs  of over 100'.  Another reason is that it is very hard to replace a HDMI connector if something goes wrong, which is not the case with cat5e/6. However, with the added equipment you have to buy it makes the costs of either is very close at the distance you are looking at."

The room that is working - is that room the main zone or is it one of the rooms served by the Audiosource amp? If it's one of the rooms on the Audiosource amp, then your problem's with that amp or the other speakers since it's getting signal from your main receiver. If that room is the main zone, you've got some work to do to narrow down the problem, starting with eliminating one device at a time from the chain."
hometheater,3cx4sy,shrivel,1 point,Sat Jul 11 16:58:24 2015 UTC,"I have a sonos player connected to my Yamaha receiver with rca cables. Then I have rca cables coming out of the Yamaha audio out into the audio source bus 1 input. All of the zones are switched to bus 1. The room that is working is zone 3 out of 6. There is a switch in each zone that is toggled to bridge. I have also tried it flipped the other way. I mistakenly wired the green as + and the white as - and when I did that I got one of the outside speakers to play a distorted muffled sound. But as soon as I switched it to the correct wiring the sound went away. Each zone has 2 inputs, a positive and a negative block terminal and each terminal contains a positive and negative input. I have the red/black in the positive terminal in each respective slot, and the white/green in the negative terminal. Each wire goes to a control knob that lets you adjust the volume on the wall. Is there any way to see if these are getting signal by using maybe a volt meter of some kind?

hometheater,3cx4sy,metabeliever,1 point,Sat Jul 11 18:42:52 2015 UTC,I literally just bought it and took it out of the box and hooked it up. If that were the case and it was not working that would mean only the zone that the one working speakers are plugged into is outputting anything. So in theory I should be able to move the wires out of that and out in different speaker wire and it should work. But they don't. And I can move the working speakers to a different zone and it works then. So could it be the control boxes for the other rooms are bad? And if so why would I get partial sound when I had the positive and negative reversed and no sound when I have them the correct way

hometheater,3cwuf3,nickmdp,2,Sat Jul 11 17:36:57 2015 UTC,I think you're looking good. However those Yamaha speakers are worth mentioning.  Generally speaking - speakers from non-speaker makers aren't good speakers.  Loudspeaker companies do it better....however they also cost more.  The good thing about speakers is - if you're unhappy with how they sound they're a piece of cake to replace.  Be sure to use that setup mic that comes with your receiver and do the auto-setup so you'll be getting the best sound you can.
hometheater,3cwuf3,seventhward,2,Sat Jul 11 19:09:37 2015 UTC,"Agreed for the most part, but I disagree with Loudspeaker companies costing more.

hometheater,3cwuf3,Disappointed_Ninja,2,Sat Jul 11 20:00:19 2015 UTC,"Matching the center to the fronts in general means making sure the speaker all have a similar sound.  If you get speakers out of the same brand/series they'll generally all be made with the same tweeters/woofers and should have a uniform sound as it travels across the stage.  If the speakers don't match tonally like that you can get a sound that changes as it moves from speaker to speaker.  Most important for the fronts, less important for the surrounds.  Just doing a quick search it doesn't really look like the NS-6490's are part of a ""set"" so to speak so I'm not sure you'd be able to find a true matching center anyway.  I'm not super adept at all this but keeping in the same brand, I would think, is a good start.  Tho if your main use will be movies you might not want to cheap out on the center (since that's where all the dialog will come from)."
hometheater,3cwuf3,seventhward,2,Sat Jul 11 21:39:38 2015 UTC,"It's not an aesthetic thing, it's more about the sound. Matching means ""Voice Matching"". For convincing surround, you want your speakers to sound identical to one another. That way if a helicopter flies around your living room, the character of the sound, the timbre, sounds consistent from speaker to speaker.  It's not an essential step. This is one of those tweak things more experienced guys put a priority on.  The easiest to do this for a 5.1 system is to have 5 identical speakers and a subwoofer...but 5 identical speakers isn't really realistic for most people. Instead, most most guys have identical speakers for the fronts and the rears and search for a center speaker to match them. Very basic example, I have Polk fronts and Polk rears so I went with a Polk center speaker that would match them.  Again - this is one of those non-essential things. You can have a good system without matching speakers -- ESPECIALLY with the way new receivers have the ability to EQ everything automagically with the setup microphone. It makes a difference but I wouldn't let it stop me from getting into the game. Welcome."

That's all the basic recommendations I have. Best of luck, and hope you post some pictures with thoughts and what you chose in the end."

hometheater,3cy3hi,e60deluxe,1 point,Sat Jul 11 21:17:56 2015 UTC,Get a new receiver and subwoofer. It will cost you though.

hometheater,3cy1fq,e60deluxe,3,Sat Jul 11 20:25:41 2015 UTC,"So it is more a Samsung problem?  Holy shit, that is beyond dumb. There is any reason for that? Every single electronic equipment worked perfectly fine that way."
hometheater,3cy1fq,e60deluxe,4,Sat Jul 11 20:27:57 2015 UTC,"yes, but TVs somehow work different. the reason is that usually the audio outs are used to feed into a receiver which will have its own volume control. in those cases, which is most cases for people when using TVs, the fixed volume output is actually more ideal. and you can turn it to fixed or variable in sony and vizio tvs.   now Samsung, is extra dumb. they dont even allow you to control your headphone port. really. but samsung is in general really dumb about audio in their TVs."
hometheater,3cy1fq,e60deluxe,1 point,Sat Jul 11 20:30:59 2015 UTC,"Well, thanks for your answer.  At least I can use my TV cable controller to control the volume there. But once I go to Netflix or Videogame, I need to stand up and change the volume in the speaker itself. It is not a super major inconvenience, but it is surely annoying."

hometheater,3cy1fq,ChrisTheRazer,2,Sat Jul 11 20:43:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah - its dumb.  It's a Fixed Audio Output.  That means it does just what it sounds like - the level of the audio it outputs is fixed.  If you want to adjust the volume, you've got the turn it up on whatever device you've sent the signal to.  The opposite would be a Variable Audio Output. Again, just like it says, this type allows you to vary the level of audio signal you're sending to your new system.  You've got two options. Either control the volume for your new sound system using your new sound system's remote (VERY COMMON) or see if your Samsung TV has an option for Variable Audio Output and use that instead.  Best of luck."

I would at least try moving them to the sides and see if you prefer it better.    dipole/bipole speakers are designed to give you a diffuse surround field which is especially useful with smaller rooms.   A bipole speaker has both side playing in phase A Dipole speaker has each side playing out of phase with each other.  If you are using Dipole speakers it may give you a strange effect that is not intended.  If your speakers are bipoles you could probably get away with it.  Regardless I would at least try it in the side positions with the ""null"" (the front center of the enclosure) pointed directly at the seating position(ears) at the left and right of the couch.  Reset you surround levels and give it a listen."
hometheater,3cvbzu,krambeck,1 point,Sat Jul 11 02:05:02 2015 UTC,The advantage of short is shorter cheaper cables.  The disadvantage is if you ever upgrade you'll need another short throw projector which are far less common.

hometheater,3cu4se,nickmdp,1 point,Fri Jul 10 21:43:45 2015 UTC,"Assuming you're putting it on the 12' wide wall, I can't see you going much higher than a 120"" screen.

hometheater,3cuvdz,CoveredInKSauce,1 point,Sat Jul 11 03:24:55 2015 UTC,It's not so much the couch as it is the speakers in relation to the seating position and the rear wall. In a perfect 5.1 setup the surround speakers will be slightly behind the seated position at about ear level. You need some distance so the surround is no overpowering.
hometheater,3cuvdz,000Destruct0,1 point,Sat Jul 11 03:34:52 2015 UTC,So it sound like bipole are out because my rears must be on Wall directly behind and above my seating position. I appreciate your help and consistent support in this subreddit.   You mentioned using regular speakers and aiming them at the rear wall? I shouldn't aim rear speakers towards my listening position?
hometheater,3cuvdz,000Destruct0,1 point,Sat Jul 11 03:25:03 2015 UTC,Surround sound should not be so loud that it's easy to localize it. When you have the couch backed up against the wall there is no room for reflecting sound if the surrounds are placed to the side of the couch. I have found that it ruins the surround effect. I solved it in my situation by pointing the surround speakers at the back wall so I only receive a small amount of direct sound with most being reflected.

Edit:  This is part of the reason I never looked at Hsu seriously.  I hear they are amazing, but they are also enormous and ugly (to me)."
hometheater,3cs4fg,eatingcarbs,1 point,Fri Jul 10 11:22:22 2015 UTC,"Most will say go sealed for music and ported for movies.   This is kind of a myth, or perhaps a half truth. There is nothing inherent to their design that makes ported/sealed are better for music/hometheater. A  sub with a flat response is better for music, and it's much easier to make a sealed sub with flat response. Cheap/poorly designed ported subs will have a peak at their tuning frequency, and often have port chuff(noise from air coming through the port). A peak at the bottom of the range isn't necessarily bad (some people even prefer it) for home theater, but it can easily make music sound boomy or muddy. Also, a lot of the perpetuation of this standard comes from the car audio world, where sealed = sound ""quality"" comps vs ported for SPL (they tune the boxes heavily to one frequency, then play test tones of that exact frequency for competition, but these sound awful with music).  So that's why that became a popular recommendation. In truth, a well designed ported sub is just as good for music as a sealed sub. From a company like Hsu, Rythmik, SVS, you are going to get a well designed product, so the choice should basically be which specs you prefer.  For the SVS subs, the ported and sealed are almost identical, the ported having just a few hz lower extension and a db or two more SPL. The main choice between those two would really be which size you prefer, the sealed is much smaller."
hometheater,3cs4fg,raeanin,2,Fri Jul 10 15:21:47 2015 UTC,"From what I've seen, the sealed versions are at least a bit 'faster' (at least in a comparison of the decay time vs frequency plot of the SB1000 vs PB1000) which I guess means the bass is 'tighter' (insert your favorite audiophile words here) and therefore more 'musical'.  EDIT: Though honestly I don't know of how much value that is given that most people's listening rooms (mine included) have insanely long decay times for bass so.... cutting a bit at the source while nice in theory might not matter much in practice? Just thinking out loud here..."

The sb2000 is best in smaller rooms and/or systems that won't use loud volume levels.

Honestly though, I'm on the verge of tossing it because PCI passthrough for the video card has just been too much of a pain. If you're REALLY comfortable with graphics card setup in Linux, then maybe it won't be so bad, but I have a 50/50 shot of my HTPC rebooting properly, and I've had no luck finding any solutions to fix it. Keep in mind that you cannot pass a keyboard/mouse through ESXi unless you pass an entire USB controller through as well. Once it's running though, it's streaming 1080p lightly compressed movies (20 GB typical size) over a network without a single jump. I'm happy to go into details or answer questions you might have on my exact setup, just let me know what you want to know.

hometheater,3cs35y,-rogo-,2,Fri Jul 10 09:08:17 2015 UTC,"Just you'll need to run speaker wire from your receiver to your speakers, then on one of the channels, either L or R, run speaker wires to the Speaker Level Input on the sub.   Since it does have speaker output on the sub, you could run one of the speakers using those terminals, instead of putting two pair of wire from one of the receivers terminals. (I have no idea how/if this affects sound though)  Basically you just need to connect your speaker wires on the corresponding +/- to +/- terminals. For inputs, depending on what output your devices have, you can find 3.5mm jack to RCA adaptor (first google search) and you can use it for anything with a headphone jack. Older game systems and dvd players will already have those on the output, so you'll just need some rca cables for those."

I've gotten some pretty neat effects out of Huey and a 125"" 2.35:1 projection screen, however, it's kind of a hassle to setup and tends to wash out the screen even at lower brightness settings.

hometheater,3cph0p,000Destruct0,1 point,Fri Jul 10 12:54:09 2015 UTC,"The sub crawl is a little harder with two subs. If you think about a wave pool, imagine dropping something in so that all the ripples are just how you like them. Now drop in two things. The ideal wave locations will change.   Luckily, its that second sub that's going to make all the difference in the world. It's really useful when one sub has a fixed location that HAS to be that way for fitment (like if it's too big to go anywhere but in one certain corner). It's that second sub that will ultimately decide how smooth your bass is.   So do the crawl in two phases. First sub as normal, and then the 2nd, with the first one in it's preferred resting place. It has to be playing since it's part of the end equation. Use something like jazz, with a smooth walking baseline."

I suppose one thing I didn't really factor in would be the cost of shipping. Mass drop has the A1's right now for roughly $275 shipped, which is what sort of spurned me into action with researching options. From what I've heard it can get expensive having things shipped directly by Chane, so two big towers would probably be well over $100 shipping.  I'll definitely check out those Yamaha's.

hometheater,3cqcl6,000Destruct0,1 point,Fri Jul 10 14:03:11 2015 UTC,"There's nothing wrong with Denon or Marantz. The only company I actively avoid due to reliability is Onkyo. They bought Pioneer so I'll hold off on them for the time being as well. I have owned Denon and I own a Marantz right now, they are fine. You might want to go check out the avs forums as you'll find a lot of very knowledgeable people there.   Now, with all that being said since you need HDCP 2.2 I think you'll get more for your money with a Yamaha RX-V379BL. As for the speakers, I'd recommend 3 A2rx-c speakers. They have dual split-gap woofers for excellent bass and that awesome ribbon tweeter. Just remember they'll need a minimum of 12"" of space behind them for the port.  Edit: I strongly recommend a center speaker. Without it you have to rely on a phantom center channel which is only effective in a small spot at the apex point between the two mains.

My girlfriend just told me that towers were a no-go in terms of WAF (so tragic), so I may spring for the trio of A2's instead. Using them as L and R isn't a problem even tho they're marketed as center channels?  In regards to the Yamaha, that is a great price and it fulfills the need for hdcp2.2. I'm wondering though why it is so cheap compared to the denon's and marantz's I linked to. Since I don't know a lot about the specs, I was using price as a gauge for quality (not the best method obviously). My concern is that the Yamaha would not be of comparable quality and feature list to the denon's which retail for much more.  The Chanes are an example of why this is a terrible marker for quality, but I feel like with the AVR's it's a different situation."
hometheater,3cqcl6,ParadigmTossOut,1 point,Fri Jul 10 23:24:16 2015 UTC,"The A2s will work better as L/R speakers than as a center channel. As for the Yamaha, that's their entry level receiver which is why it's priced as it is. Yamaha receivers are well made and will typically last as long as you want to use it.  One reason they are a bit less than a corresponding Denon or Marantz is they don't have to pay Audyssey a license fee - the take being that their auto room calibration is inferior. In every other respect they are just as good though."
hometheater,3cqcl6,000Destruct0,1 point,Sat Jul 11 00:23:30 2015 UTC,"Awesome. I think I'm going to go with the a2's as L, R, and center.

I had kind of disregarded them based on the amount of love denon and marantz get on here.  In terms of set-up, I should plug in my cable box and ps3 into receiver, then HDMI from receiver to tv right? That will allow me to switch sources and control volume through the receiver, correct?

hometheater,3coh56,Joncat84,2,Fri Jul 10 07:35:53 2015 UTC,"I really like my 70"" Vizio E701i-A3. Admittedly I bought it a few years ago, but it's a great TV. Great picture, minimal ""smart""ness (I have a Chromecast for that), and it was right around $1,000 when I bought it. I think 4K is still in its infancy."
hometheater,3coh56,Excrucibo,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:43:43 2015 UTC,"Agreed.  I have the E701i-B3 model. A new model, the  VIZIO E70-C3 (new stand design) was recently released and is very well priced (check it out on Amazon.com:   http://amzn.com/B00SMBG0S0 ).    But with your budget, I strongly recommend that you look at the 80 inch models, such as:  VIZIO M801i-A3 80-Inch 1080p Smart LED HDTV: http://amzn.com/B00HVX5OO6 ).  I really like the 70"" screen - but would really love the larger 80"" screen."
hometheater,3coh56,BuckyDog,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:33:23 2015 UTC,"Stick away from the M series. The 55"" got recalled. It also had issues even after the recall with lines flickering and a green line running across the bottom of the screen.  The E series is the worst of the Vizio lineup to be honest. Not an opinion.  The M series had the best picture and was still at a good price point. Only problem was the lines."

hometheater,3cqs5s,scroatmeal,3,Fri Jul 10 00:54:36 2015 UTC,"I would get a better DVI splitter.  Something that isn't passive is a much better choice.  DVI and HDMI are signal compatible for video.  You won't get audio out to your TV via DVI but a very simple DVI to HDMI adaptor would work just fine.   Actually I just looked up that card, you have 2 DVI and an HDMI.  Hook the TV via the HDMI and you are good to go.  No need for anything extra."
hometheater,3cqs5s,mistakenotmy,2,Fri Jul 10 03:38:43 2015 UTC,"You might need an DVI to HDMI converter to connect to the TV. I don't think DVI inputs are very common on televisions.   Other than that, I think it should work. Not familiar with the reliability of DVI splitters though. It might be problematic if your monitor isn't 1920x1080 native resolution. The TV will only take 1080p or 720p (assuming it's HDTV, not 4K). Even with the 4K, you need to send a native TV resolution to the 2nd monitor for it to work, if the TV and monitor share a connection."
hometheater,3cpd6z,Sixoul,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:22:28 2015 UTC,Firstly what's your budget for the TV? This TV I noticed is pretty budget grade and only 720p. But if that's what your budget allows fair enough. Im sure there are much better TV's in that price range though. For your sound go for a 2.1 system with the opportunity to upgrade to 5.1 in the future if that's within your budget. We need to know your budget to help properly.
hometheater,3cpd6z,WolfyCat,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:52:36 2015 UTC,"Well I found a guide for gaming TVs on reddit in /r/ps4 and it basically said 32"" you won't notice 1080p, which quite frankly I believe since I don't notice it on my TV in my room, 60hz is good while higher causes input lag, sony, samsung, pansonic(?) are the best brands for gaming TVs and to go LED if 32"" or smaller. I guess my price range would be $250 for a tv. I'm not really sure audio wise, I'm not sure what the price ranges. But yeah basically a budget build maybe something that can end up becoming better later?"
hometheater,3cpd6z,Ji-L87,1 point,Fri Jul 10 01:05:31 2015 UTC,"Rtings.com is a good source for finding a good TV for gaming purposes.  As for the sound, it depends on how much you want to spend. Here's some examples listed in order of cost:   Used PC 2.1 setups: These Creative's or Logitech's can be really cheap if bought used. Usually connects with a single 3.5mm cable. Plug that into the TVs headphone out (if it has one) and enjoy way better sound. Old compact stereo: Can be really cheap, often gives you tone controls or a ""bass boost"" for some more low-end. Can be modular since you can swap out the speakers for better ones. Look for ones with RCA inputs for external sources such as a CD player. Then use a 3.5mm to RCA in order to hook it up to the TV. Used amp and bookshelfs: Get an old stereo amp or pre-HDMI AV reciever for cheap. Buy some bookshelfs that look nice and some cheap cabling. Done! Also gives you flexibility if you want to upgrade.   If you want to buy new equipment, there are guides on /budgetaudiophlie and r/zeos based on budget.  I heard a pair of Dali Zensor 1 today that had a very small footprint but a large, impressive sound.   Good luck!"

hometheater,3cpd6z,Ji-L87,1 point,Thu Jul 9 23:53:19 2015 UTC,"I can only speak for myself but I like it because the reviews are short and goes into the things that I feel many other reviews leave out, which is gaming performance - input lag and motion blur. 4:4:4 chroma is also important to me and as of lately they've started to mention that as well, as well as their settings for the display.  Lastly, they often use the same screencap from Skyfall as a test image, which enables you to do some simple comparisons - although might not be accurate."

If you can afford them then yes I would simply because no one ever regrets purchasing something that's too good. Since this is a minimum of a 3-4 year investment may as well do it right.   That being said, surround speakers aren't as critical and you could probably get by just fine with MB42x or better yet Wavecrest HVL-1 speakers."

hometheater,3cph8q,000Destruct0,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:17:19 2015 UTC,30 days. That should be sufficient to determine if you like them. Be forewarned - these are not sensational speakers. No massive bass or sizzling highs. Their design goal was to create as neutral a speaker as they could for the price so it's a very honest speaker.

hometheater,3cpfsf,BinaryMaestro,2,Thu Jul 9 18:42:51 2015 UTC,With that budget I'd probably get pretty much what I have! Here's what I'd do:  Receiver $750: http://www.accessories4less.com/make-a-store/item/marsr7008/marantz-sr7008-9.2-network-home-theater-receiver-airplay-w/3-yr-warranty/1.html  L/R Mains $1400: http://smile.amazon.com/MartinLogan-Motion-Gloss-Black-Floorstanding/dp/B007THXXXS/ref=sr_1_13?ie=UTF8&qid=1436470017&sr=8-13&keywords=martin+logan+motion  Center Channel $350: http://smile.amazon.com/MartinLogan-Motion-Center-Channel-Speaker/dp/B0035FZ13I/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1436470017&sr=8-3&keywords=martin+logan+motion  4x Surrounds $800: http://smile.amazon.com/MartinLogan-Motion-Bookshelf-Discontinued-Manufacturer/dp/B0035FZ11K/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1436470339&sr=8-1&keywords=martin+logan+motion+2  Subwoofer $880: http://www.hsuresearch.com/products/vtf-3mk5HP.html  That's slightly over budget but the extra for the sub is worth it. If the $4000 is a hardcap you can opt for the VTF-2 MK4 which would be $600.  If you have a need for wifi/bluetooth then you can substitute the Denon X-4100w for the SR-7008.

hometheater,3cpfsf,mtghazi,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:57:27 2015 UTC,"I came across the Martin Logans when I'd seen other people compare them in reviews to the A5's or the SVS Ultra's. Are they really worth the price? They look clean and basic, which I know really doesn't have anything to do with the engineering.  Those surrounds are quite hefty at $200 a pop. What about subbing the surrounds for dipoles and keeping 2 for the rear? Are you not a fan of the dipoles?  Also, that receiver, is 9.2 would I use the extra two channels? Why not look at the 5008 instead?"
hometheater,3cpfsf,000Destruct0,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:07:35 2015 UTC,"Martin Logan is one of the high end manufacturers and yes, I believe they justify their price. The AMT tweeter on these things must be heard to be believed - clean, open, crystal clear. This is as close as you'll get to an electrostatic speaker without owning one and with considerably less muss and fuss with regard to driving them and placement.  I'm not a huge fan of dipole speakers but you can use them and use the Motion 2s for the other surround. Curious as to why you want dipoles? I've recommended bipolar speakers for those with 5.1 systems to get a more immersive sound.   The Marantz 7008 has Audyssey MultEQ XT32 which is much better than the XT version used on the 5008. These speakers deserve the best... give it to them. Not using all channels simply leaves more power for the amps you are using. I have that same receiver and a 5.1 system. Works great. The Audyssey is the ticket here."
hometheater,3cpfsf,000Destruct0,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:24:29 2015 UTC,"If it is as clear as you say, it may be a very likely candidate.   I figured that the bipolar speakers would help fill the room with invisible sound coming from the sides as opposed to a directed bookshelf since It will span 14' from speaker to speaker with the viewers sitting in two rows in the middle. Perhaps its better to go with a 5.1? I have no experience with a 7.1, just a 5.1HTiB pos..   Your points on the upgraded Audyssey makes sense. I could see myself spending the extra few hundred so that the speakers are set up where you can hear them properly."
hometheater,3cpfsf,000Destruct0,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:06:11 2015 UTC,"If one of the best buy stores near  you is a Magnolia they'll have Martin Logans to listen to... a treat to be sure!  That's our disconnect, I think you were mistaking dipole and bipolar - they are similar but not quite the same thing.  With the size of your room you can run 7.1 and it will work well. I don't see the need for bipolar speakers in a 7.1 system though. You could do bipolar speakers and 5.1 and that would likely work pretty good."
hometheater,3cpfsf,000Destruct0,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:14:24 2015 UTC,"Awesome! I believe that they do have Magnolia. I will certainly check them out this weekend.  Yes, I thought they were interchangeable terms. I know now they aren't, but really don't know enough about them.  I will probably just end up running 7.1 with the 4 bookshelves for the surrounds like you suggested. I think that will be easier to set up and probably give better sound."

hometheater,3cpfsf,000Destruct0,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:46:35 2015 UTC,"Okay, I may be able to talk the other half into allowing them. If I bump those up, should I do the same with the center?"
hometheater,3cpfsf,raeanin,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:48:54 2015 UTC,"You  don't really need to spend $700 on a receiver if you don't want all of the wireless and networking features and such. A $300-$400 Denon or Marantz will get you a solid receiver with all the basic features and good room correction.  For surrounds I prefer dipoles for the L/R and monopoles for the rears. It sounds less localized to the people sitting in the far left/right seating positions.  For speakers, I would take a look at Klipsch's offerings. Horns lend themselves very well to HT use, and since you say it will not be used much for music(where most of the klipsch complaints come from) there's few options better for the price. High sensitivity is the way to go for HT IMO, as receivers provide fairly low power and movie soundtracks have extremely high dynamics compared to most music.  For a 17' viewing distance, I would seriously reconsider a 110"" screen. The viewing angle will be way below even the most conservative recommendations. I would go with 130"" minimum and 150"" would be even better. Since you are watching 95% movies, I would even consider going with a much wider (160-170) 2.35:1 screen, though this requires specific projectors(or a lens) to accomplish.   FWIW, this is would I would do with audio with that room/budget:  L/R: Klipsch RP280F x2 - $1350  C: Kipsch RP-450C - $650  Subs: two Rythmik LV12 subs - $1140  L/R Surrounds: Fluance XLBP - $200  Rear surrounds: Fluance XL7S - $180  Receiver: Denon X3000 - $390"

Once I purchase, I'll probably come back to look for suggestions for placing.  Another question - I was surprised that the sub was talking  almost 50% of the budget. I was wondering if the sub is that much more important than the LCR?"
hometheater,3cpcm3,truthlesshunter,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:17:44 2015 UTC,"For $379 I wouldn't get either of those, I'd get this: http://www.accessories4less.com/make-a-store/item/denavrx2100w/denon-avr-x2100w-7.2-receiver-wi-fi/bluetooth/airplay-w/3-yr-warranty/1.html  It is superior to both of those at a lower price. As for speakers, you aren't going to get a decent 7.1 set with $600. Refurbished or new. Secondarily, unless this is in a really big room 7.1 is a waste. Better to go 5.1 and, with your budget start with 3.1 and even that will be a bit over $600 if  you want it to be really good.   For 3.1 I'd opt for 3x Wavecrest HVL-1 speakers and an Hsu STF-2 subwoofer. Add the surrounds when your budget recovers. If you must have a full surround now then get a less expensive receiver otherwise your budget is going to be seriously unbalanced."

That makes sense about the 3.1 thetn adding as I go along. I'll go that route if that gives the best quality/bang for my buck. Thanks for the suggestions and it gives me somewhere to start looking.    Quick question though, semi related..I haven't been in the surround sound game in a long time and I don't really know the name of those things...but you know how the receiver you mentioned (and the ones i did too..) have ""round"" options for where the gauge wire clips into (red/black)...what are those called? Using actual clips/ends instead of having the wires stuck into the speakers and back and just held by a springed connection would be great!"

hometheater,3cm2gt,judgemonroe,2,Thu Jul 9 13:48:33 2015 UTC,"Depends where you are and what you are doing but for Crestron work that involves being a tech and programming I bill $80-$120 CAD an hour depending on the circumstances, I'm a Crestron Certified Programmer.  I could have gotten into C4 but at the time I found the market was totally saturated up here with C4 dealers and techs/programmers so instead I worked on my Crestron certification through a local high end audio dealer, at first work was slow and I was frustrated but I purchased lots of used equipment and kept learning.  Eventually I got more programming work from the dealer and also worked with other programmers remotely and learned a lot about what I should and shouldn't do and took the Advanced Programming test CTI-P301 and came home and worked in my spare time to finish the test for certification, handed it in months later and I was certified.  Shortly after the dealer I worked with went bankrupt, all of his customers knew me and still call regularily for me to change and add stuff to systems and I work with another dealer when I need to purchase stuff, I work as a consultant in another line of work so I do Crestron on the side and can still bill out at these rates and I imagine its the same in the U.S, the programmers I worked with remotely charged about $120 an hour USD or would give a quote also based on the project.  On some jobs I will let them(remote programmers) do some of the more challenging programming and I'm still paid to be onsite to confirm everything and make adjustments as needed.  If there is one thing I can say about Crestron, you can do pretty well ANYTHING with their code you can think of but you need to keep practicing all the time to stay current, owning one of their system in your own home is key! This way you can test new code while pissing off your wife when you break something."

I like programming it but I hate their hardware. Their documentation sucks and most of their support techs are unhelpful. If you ever run into a real issue all you can do is attempt to factory reset the controller and if that fails RMA.  I know that Crestron is deep and daunting but I'm excited about learning it. From what I've heard and what I've seen their hardware is way superior to Control4 and their systems are extremely reliable.  I really take issue with the fact that Control4 has so much of their interface built in flash. It also has no ability to be expanded or customised to fit tailored or high demand deployments. We have a client that had a large install planned and they expected us to deploy it according to that spec. We saw the spec and pretty much laughed at them and told them they were going to need so many other pieces to do this. With Crestron it would appear you can just change out the expansion cards to meet different situations."

hometheater,3cm2gt,metabeliever,1 point,Thu Jul 9 11:09:06 2015 UTC,"A lot of it really. I deal with so many different situations every day I have to have a really wide spectrum of knowledge. The thing that makes AV harder than IT (imho) is the lack of good documentation for a lot of the devices we deal with. The firm I work for has over 300 Control4 clients and their hardware has piss-poor documentation. They have so many indicator lights that are undocumented and features and problems that it's a headache. Their knowledge base is the worst.  If I had to go back in time and give myself advice again I would've included networking principles and basic architecture. The way AV is nowadays uses so much networking it's not even funny.  Another good piece of advice would be to look at all your equipment from a larger perspective. Identifying switches, sources, and end points. I really didn't grasp this until after working for control4 for a while."

hometheater,3cmphg,GeckoDeLimon,3,Thu Jul 9 15:19:18 2015 UTC,"Here's the skinny.   No good speaker will have that connection. You only see speakers connected that way in the cheapest of home theater setups. They do it to make connections easier. One speaker? One plug. No bare wires. Easy peasy. However, it's really a silly idea on the part of the manufacturer, as it makes it all too possible to connect low-voltage devices (DVD players, cable boxes, phones with Aux cables) to a high voltage output, potentially damaging any of those devices should the accidentally be hooked up to the wrong jack on the back of the HT receiver.   First off, we need to recommend speakers of the proper impedance. Is there any mention of ""4 ohms"" or ""8 Ω"" on the back of the speakers? Or on the back of the receiver? We'll need to recommend something that matches or at least is in the neighborhood. Expect to buy a pair. I would recommend that the new speakers be used for the main left / right speakers, and then shift one of those original left / right to take the place of the speaker that took a crap.   Next, we'll need to find a way to take a speaker that accepts bare wire and adapt it to the receiver (which does not). My advice would be to cut the cable off the old speaker and strip the jacket off the speaker end. You'll have two wires inside that cable. An ""inside"" and ""outside"" wire. The outside wire may appear to be a mesh shield, wrapped around the other. Alternately, you may have one wire with insulation on it and one without. Anyway, that outside / uninsulated wire goes to the negative (black) terminal on the new speaker and the inside wire goes to the positive (red). Be sure that no strands of the bare wires can touch each other. Since you're kludging together a solution, don't be afraid to use a little electrical tape to keep things apart if need be."

In the store I thought the Epson looked better, but who knows how they really had it set up.  The Sony would be the better choice for any gaming.  I'm very happy with my purchase, but it's also my first projector.  BTW, this projector is definitely made for a light controlled room.  It's far too dim for living room use with lots of ambient light."

If you aren't using a subwoofer then it's possible you might get a slight benefit, whether it would be audible or not is open to debate.  Typically, bi-amping is best if you are also using an active crossover and even then it would take a sharp ear to hear the difference. Considering the receiver you have and the speakers, I wouldn't think you'll be able to hear any difference."

Since the tweeters need about one fifth - one tenth of the power that the woofers do, there will only be 5-10% reduction in current, compared to a full range load.  So very likely zero benefit, unless the output had audible distortion when driving both drivers."

I was bi amping my 3.1 setup until earlier this year. I don't have towers but some decent large bookshelf type speakers, I think rated down to ~40Hz, as well as my center (similar to L and R) and I was using 2 external multichannel amps. I wouldn't say it was a night and day difference but I swear to you that my noise floor dropped significantly. I admit this is largely 'anecdotal' evidence but I stand by that my system sounded best with the fully balanced separates I had, but it lacked a real EQ or room correction so I moved on from it.  Do I miss it? Eh, I can tell a difference but it isn't huge. I'm sure if I had bigger mains it would be more pronounced/matter more.  I've had at least 5 different configurations in the last 3 years using different receivers, amps, and cabling configurations and while it sounded great and I had tons of headroom it was more of an exercise to put theory into practice for me. I had always wanted to try it and lived with it for a few months until the novelty wore off. I've since sold the gear I had been using and now have an Audyssey capable receiver I salvaged and it sounds good, but would like to go back to seperate a once HDMI 2.0/HDCP2.2 and 3D audio settle down some."

Speaker wire is cheap, and unless you have a place where it's difficult to run, then it's fairly trivial to go ahead and run a bi-amp. Might as well remove any possible limitations on your gear operating at peak performance."
hometheater,3cl3km,raeanin,4,Wed Jul 8 20:29:04 2015 UTC,"Bi-wiring is snake oil. There is no electrical principal that would provide an audible difference in sound by simply sending the sound through 2 wire pairs, which both then go through a passive xover network.  Bi-amping can produce a minor audible difference vs a passive xover system IF it is done properly with active xovers and speakers w/o passive xover networks built in(or ones that have been removed.) Still, the difference is very minimal, and  is really only done when min/maxing an extremely high end audiophile systems. In a list of 100 things you could do to improve the sound quality of a system/room, it would be in the bottom 10."

To use your PC as a second monitor and record the copter.  I have that right?  Do you have an HDMI input on your laptop?  If not you would need something like this:  http://www.fullcompass.com/product/388009.html  At that point you can skip the HDMI conversion as the Blackmagic capture card can take HDMI or analog.

hometheater,3cl1fu,adumbnobody,3,Wed Jul 8 19:05:37 2015 UTC,"Sony is really the leader in terms of 4K. I work for an integrator in NYC, and the XBR series has really impressed me.  If you want to do some research on your own or look Samsung or LG, you are going to find 'dumb' TVs are being phased out, especially if you are looking for 4k content. The reason being is there are very VERY few devices that offer content in 4K (Sony makes a FMP-X10 which fulfills this role). But if you wanted to use your Apple TV and watch Netflicks on a 4K TV, the content coming out of the AppleTV is still 1080p. If you have a receiver, you are going to want to find out if the HDMI ports are HDCP2.2 compliant (chances are, if you bought it more than a couple years ago, the receiver won't be). Again, you are going to need to check your video card to make sure that the HDMI out is HDCP2.2, otherwise you are still going to run into issues.  Seriously, your best bet is to get a Sony 4K TV, which has Amazon Prime and Netflix. Not sure if Prime has 4K content currently, but I do know that the Netflix app on the Sony TV is 4k.  And I don't know what your set up is, but please don't think that you can stream/airplay 4k content from your PC to the 4k TV or any external media device. First, I can guarantee your network is not cut out for it, and second, airplay protocol does not support 4K. Your going to need to go HDMI out of the PC into the TV or a HDCP2.2 compatible receiver. If your HDMI run is over 40' or so, you are also going to have issues with the 4K content over the HDMI cable (regardless of its quality). You are then going to need to look into getting a fiber HDMI cable (look up Celerity, they make great solutions for this)."

I picked up a 60"" for 1300 the other week and am quite pleased. They make them from 43"" to 80 and the 43 I believe is only $600 (US)  What you want to look for when comparing is that the tv has a HDMI port or multiple ports that accept a 60hz 4k input using HDCP 2.2. this ensures the TV is ""future proof"" at least for the time being.. Also, smart TV is essential with 4k at the moment because basically nothing supports 4k except for streaming stuff from the TV itself. 4K apple TV, roku, chromecast will arrive soon so just hang in there. Also, keep in mind that 1080P signals are up converted to 4K when displayed on a 4K TV. The quality of this effect depends on the processing power of the TV. For comparison, the M-series which I was talking about has a quad core graphics processor (for up scaling and effects) and a separate dual core for smart TV stuff (Sony had this tech on some of last years models). This technology is quite new, and the difference in one model year could be HUGE. Sony is the leader in 4K because they are a generation ahead being the ones who pioneered the tech. They are also significantly more expensive than competitors because of this.  My advice: This year is the first year in which 4K TV's are priced at a point that makes sense for the average Joe looking to buy a new TV.  Yes, paying 300 or 400 more than you would for a 1080p to go to 4K is worth it.  No, the technology has not even began to reach its peak and NOTHING is future proof. HDR, OLED, micro dimming etc. may turn your investment into old news within 10 years. This is the risk of being a so-called ""early adopter"". On the bright side, spending 800 or 900 bucks on a nice 1080p TV is a complete waste because its old tech but spending 1200 or 1500 on a 4K model is not, and when 4K becomes the mainstream, you will thank yourself. TL;DR= don't spend more than $2,000. get one with HDCP 2.2 at 60hz. Go with the Vizio M-series if you want value, or go with a Sony if you can afford to do so. Upgrade your internet if you want to stream 4K. it requires a minimum of about 30 mbps"

I tend to shy away from Onkyo as well until I am comfortable that the reliability issues they've had lately are resolved.  I am a bit confused. If you have no intention of using the system in conjuction with a TV how is it a ""home theater system?""  If you want high quality with your budget then allocate about $700 to speakers (and use it on a pair of high quality speakers) and the remainder on the receiver.   If you feel the need for more speakers add to what you've bought as your budget permits but a music only system has no use for a center channel speaker or surrounds. If you purchase wisely you won't need a sub either. What you should eventually end up with is 2 pair of very nice speakers and a receiver to drive them with.  What you are describing is not a home theater system, you want a good stereo system."
hometheater,3ck19h,000Destruct0,2,Wed Jul 8 15:22:57 2015 UTC,"Good to know about Bose! Honestly, I was leaning towards them, my impression of them was that they were/are a very good name in speakers. I guess that's a big part of the reason I posted here, I wanted information from people who really know about this sort of thing. What's the problem with Bose? The quality they provide isn't in line with their price?  You're correct, I was obviously using the wrong term when I said ""home theater system"". I will update my post accordingly.  This is all great information, I didn't know it would be pointless to buy centre channel speakers or surrounds. I will certainly revise what I'm looking for accordingly.  Thanks! As a layman on this sort of thing it's great to get information from someone who actually know what they're talking about!"
hometheater,3ck19h,000Destruct0,3,Wed Jul 8 16:16:24 2015 UTC,"Bose speakers are the embodiment of mediocre yet they sell as if they are state of the art. They are the product of clever marketing combined with shrewd engineering. They produce very good midrange but artificially enhanced bass and awful high end.   Because mid-range is where the bulk of both movie and music sound is at they will sound good to those accustomed to TV speakers, stock automobile sound systems, and table top radios. Take that and add in the clever ""direct-reflecting"" BS and you have Bose. It's all made even worse because they use cheap materials as well."
hometheater,3ck19h,raeanin,2,Wed Jul 8 16:32:44 2015 UTC,"If you want something that can get loud, you should focus your search on high sensitivity speakers. Look for stuff that is ~93db/1w or higher.  In your price rance, this basically limits you to Klipsch, Bic, JBL and pro-audio speakers(if you don't care about looks). There are also the Hsu bookshelf speakers that get pretty loud at ~92 db/1w and get great reviews for their price point.  First thing I would do is check on Craigslist or whichever local classified you use (and canuckaudiomart), and look for used Klipsch   towers. Look for the higher end models (anything that comes with 8"", 10"" or 12"" woofers is typically in their 'reference' line), especially the ones from the 90s and early 2000s and up like the  KLF 10, KLF 20, KLF 30, etc. These towers are absolutely gold for what you can get them for ($100-$400 a piece depending on the model/condition). You really won't get something better than Klipsch reference towers for Home theater untill you get to Pro-theater gear like JTR. (not to say there aren't other high sound-quality speakers around, just nothing that can hit high SPL with good quality).  If you can't find anything around locally, check out the Bic high sensitivity (PL series) towers on Amazon.  For the receiver, I would go with whatever the cheapest receiver you can find with Audyssey silver. Power is mostly irrelevant in receivers, they are all roughly the same power, and with high efficiency speakers, 20 or 30 solid watts is all you need to hit reference level(far louder than is comfortable to most people)."

The a2rx-c i think i can get for $400 for the set if i wait for massdrop. At the 1k side i can find new KEF ls50 give or take $100.   budget is for L+R speakers only. will add the center as a separate budget. Receiver already exists (although sounds like the KEF needs a high end receiver so upgrade could be needed)  Reason i am looking at those is that i have not read reviews praising a speaker being way too cheap for its value like the LS50 since i was reading up on the Chane's   Might i find a speaker much better than the a2s or are the Chanes that far underpriced that they are the best sub $1k speaker at half that price?

hometheater,3cjyaj,00OO00,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:27:25 2015 UTC,"Most receivers will not support HDMI audio on zone 2, but will support analog inputs as well as optical/coax digital.  If the receiver has AirPlay, it should in theory allow that for zone 2.  For the Mac Mini, you could always use the optical out for zone 2 assuming that it outputs the same audio simultaneously as HDMI.  I'm not sure on this as I have never tried it.  You need a special 3.5mm to toslink cable."
hometheater,3cjyaj,pcdude99,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:26:50 2015 UTC,"you are absolutely right that they dont support digital. and you are lucky enough to have found this out prior to purchase.  the multizone stuff only works with an analog input, so i'd recommend you have a separate analog input connection from the mac/airplay into one of the analog inputs on the receiver. I'd use something like CD or ""media player"" as those inputs, and assign the other outputs to a digital input. so you'll have 2 connections going into the receiver from airplay and 2 from the mac mini. one thats analog and one thats digital. you'll have the receiver listing 4 total inputs even though theres only 2 actual devices.  bear in mind that  you'll probably need to finagle the settings on airplay and mac mini to get that particular device to output what you want.  alternatively, you should be able to use zone2 with media server and/or network play, so maybe you can have the receiver pick up on that?"
hometheater,3cjyaj,ss0889,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:28:46 2015 UTC,You could use a standalone DAC. This will convert the digital signal (optical or coax) to analogue RCA line level. Here is the one I am using for that exact use: http://www.amazon.com/FiiO-Digital-Analog-Audio-Converter/dp/B005PWPUW6

hometheater,3clcth,e60deluxe,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:44:48 2015 UTC,The SM115s are okay. If all that is wrong is a rotted surround I'd keep them and fix them. Surround kits can be found on ebay or places like parts express.  Ditch the 301s. They were mediocre speakers when they were new and now one no longer has the benefit of MDF.   The sub is okay but not in a really good system as it's 6db downpoint is 30 hz which is not good at all. My tower speakers can probably match that.
hometheater,3ckdim,FriedHollywood,2,Wed Jul 8 16:21:00 2015 UTC,Speakers aren't worth much but the receiver alone is worth what you paid. Depending on what speakers you have you might want to sell the ones in the kit.

Only issue with the product itself is frequent track skipping over wifi AirPlay will crash the AirPlay connection. Over Bluetooth, no issues. It works smoother after I upgraded the firmware (which erased all settings) No other issues and it sounds great!  The first warehouse deals one was DOA and the second was missing the Audyssey mic, but they gave me a credit so I can buy one separately. Also the refurbs don't come with a warranty.   http://camelcamelcamel.com/Denon-AVRS700W-R-Refurbished-Bluetooth-Certified/product/B00KSBZZ8I?context=browse  TLDR: I like the receiver, this is a good price, if you're considering getting a refurb, be prepared for some hassle."

hometheater,3cias6,000Destruct0,1 point,Wed Jul 8 03:53:47 2015 UTC,"Are these receivers ones that would work for what I'm trying to do? It looks like they both have ""zone 2"" or ""zone B"" outputs:     Denon AVR 2113CI   Yamaha RX-V577     Also, what does it mean if it says that it has a ""powered zone 2""?"
hometheater,3cias6,000Destruct0,2,Wed Jul 8 12:23:21 2015 UTC,"I don't personally use multi-zone but, if my memory serves, powered zone 2 means it can route an independent source to zone 2 where a passive zone 2 simply passes whatever source is chosen for the main zone."
hometheater,3cias6,Readinthedark,2,Wed Jul 8 13:26:56 2015 UTC,"First, I want to congratulate you on a well documented post.   Many Zone 2's on receivers are analog. So the chromecast to your patio may not work.  You will have to get a midgrade receiver that will eat most of you budget.    You can start with a 2.0 system for your family room with a pair of bookshelf speakers."
hometheater,3cias6,Readinthedark,1 point,Wed Jul 8 12:47:44 2015 UTC,"Is there usually a differentiation between which inputs can go to which zones? How can I tell if there is?  For example, on this receiver, I would plug the Chromecast into one of the HDMI ports at the top (say, HDMI 2). The receiver would push video to the TV via the 'HDMI OUT' port, and audio to the speakers based on my selection (e.g. if I selected Zone A, it would push it to Zone A, etc.), right?  How could I tell if that receiver would only route certain inputs to Zone B?    edit: For that receiver, it says:   The same source will play in both zones (cannot use two sources).     Does that mean that zone 2 can't be run without sound also coming out of zone 1, and vice versa? Like...whatever is playing on my TV is always playing on my patio? I guess it's fine if I can just turn zone 2 on/off, but I don't want it to always be running sound outside. If we're all standing outside, I don't mind if the music is also playing inside though.    Edit 2: This is from a user review of the Yamaha RX-V577 I linked:   Second, the Zone B feature is killer because it outputs audio from digital inputs as well, i.e. audio coming in through HDMI. Unlike other receivers with Zone 2 capability, this allows you to output any audio playing in Zone A to Zone B, including TV, cable and any other audio from digital or analog sources. This lets me use my kitchen speakers to listen to the cable TV when I'm cooking. With most receivers with Zone 2 capability, including my old Onkyo, Zone 2 can't be used for any inputs coming into the receiver with HDMI, so all you can really use it for is music (e.g. from radio, a usb source, or stream). The downside is that Zone B on the Yamaha has to be the same source as Zone A, which is not an issue for me. If your second zone is a patio or other area completely separated from the main zone, and all you want in the second zone is music and radio, get a receiver with an independent Zone 2.     So it sounds like Zone B can just be turned on/off, and will play whatever is coming through Zone A??"
hometheater,3cias6,Readinthedark,2,Wed Jul 8 14:38:32 2015 UTC,"Yeah, just looked through the Yamaha website.    They have two different naming systems.  They use ""Zone B"" as a 2nd zone that mirrors Zone A, so it has to play the SAME source.  They have ""Zone 2"" which can play an different source at the same time.  This is probably what you are looking for and maybe worth the money.  You would need to step up to the V677 for Zone 2 independant functionality.  Regardless, you can turn off Zone B or Zone 2 so its not always playing."
hometheater,3cias6,Readinthedark,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:48:04 2015 UTC,"I was reading through the manuals for the 577 and 677 (because who wants to do actual work?), and it sounded to me like the 577 could mirror any input to zone 'B' on the 577 (but not independent inputs), but only analog inputs to zone '2' on the 677 (but it can be independent of zone 1).  Am I reading that right? Here's a link to the support site with owner's manuals, if you are also procrastinating as hard as I am right now. Since the only thing I would use the patio speakers for is music via the chromecast, and I'm assuming that I wouldn't be inside watching TV while people are outside hanging out, it sounds like the 577 is the better option? Either way, both of these receivers have Pandora and Spotify through their app, so I don't even think I would need the Chromecast for music (but would still use it for some movies / TV shows and whatnot)."

We can get it working with not a whole lot of work or cash.  those connectors are for the positive and negative cables to connect to two amps.  One amp for the high range, and one amp for the low range.  Those little angled brackets that connect the red to each other and the black to each other are there so you can also use just a single amp.  Leave those in place.  you'll need some speaker wire or lamp cord.  Strip the end about 3/4 of an inch to expose the wire, , shape it into a ""U"" or ""J"", then unscrew a red cap a little, hook the exposed wire around the post, and screw the cap back down until it's tight.  you don't need to muscle it down.  do the same for the other wire on a black cap.  the wire coming out of one side shouldn't even come close to the other side.  OK you're nearly done.  You need an amp.  others in this thread have recommended a full receiver, but you don't need that if you're hooking it up to your phone or ipad.  Get one of these:  http://www.amazon.com/microFidelity-Audio-Amplifier-Model-Black/dp/B004HW3KKE/  and hook it up in ""mono"" mode as seen in the last image.  red from one side and black on the other.  set the switch on the front to ""M"".  Get one of these too hook your ipad up to it:  http://www.amazon.com/BlueRigger-3-5mm-Stereo-Audio-Cable/dp/B008UG6GCC/  Yes it works.  it's a little goofy.

hometheater,3cfevu,blownfuse,3,Tue Jul 7 14:29:58 2015 UTC,"If you switch input for the TV by going to Devices and then change the volume while still in the TV device screen, it's going to send volume control to the TV.

The activity holds the setting of where to change the volume, and by switching to the devices screen you leave your current activity."

I had a pair of bookshelf speakers with 5.25"" woofers and the ribbon tweeter. Sounded wonderful with my SVS subwoofer. I had always planned on tower speakers though so when an opportunity arose to get towers I did. They have 2 6.5"" woofers, a 5.25"" midrange and the same ribbon tweeter.  I really didn't expect much of a difference but it was pretty obvious. The towers had a fuller, more richer sounding midrange. High end and bass were more or less the same but the midrange was much better sounding - more solid.  This may not apply to the Chane's since they have the split-gap woofer. What sub do you have?"

Does the harmony not support discrete IR outputs? You should be able to designate a port for the bluray and a port for your HTIB so they don't ""see"" each other commands.  Lastly, you could try replacing the power commands for the bluray in the harmony with play for power on and power toggle for power off. If it will let you build a macro even better, make power off issue a play command wait then issue power toggle to make sure it is in an off state."

With that in mind, I didn't want to risk going to 135"" or higher and have it be dim and muddy.    My contractor was already hesitant about recommending the 120"", and it also fit a bit of a sweet spot where I could see the entire screen over the bar and chairs while playing pool.

I'd say if you make any future changes, paint that front wall black or add black to it: it's going to make the image pop that much more and reduce reflection.  Also, look into doing a scope size screen with masking for your different aspect ratios.  You've definitely got the room to expand there!"

When there's a bunch of people over to watch sports, I'm not worried about the image quality enough to do any more painting (at least not for 6 more months.  One of the big requirements I had while making this was that it had to be simple enough for the wife to be able to navigate, and getting a system that could automate aspect ratio and masking I'm sure would be quite expensive.

I like the layout overall but I dislike the stand you have sitting in front of the projector. It looks extremely small for the space and does not match the other furniture.   I also don't like the blue you have chosen for the walls, for some reason the fixed blue is completely off putting. I just think there is more you can do to make it more inviting. IE. Two different colors of paint, mounted shelves, indirect lighting by the pool table so the overheads don't wash out the picture, framed pictures/posters, matching brown on furniture pieces and curtains. (I see 4 different shades of brown)  Others may disagree but I thought you might want an honest, yet critical opinion to help guide your thoughts on the design.  I like the layout a lot and you have a great space for a home theater.   I hope my thoughts are useful for you."
hometheater,3c9hpk,rickman1011,2,Tue Jul 7 01:18:42 2015 UTC,"This is exactly why I'm not an interior decorator, and I'm glad to get some criticism as well.  I can definitely see what you're saying about the center speaker stand.  It is something that I've been toying with solutions for, but haven't settled on anything.  Maybe a wall stand, or something specifically meant to hold a center speaker in the right spot.  I agree on needing to make things more inviting as well.  I've actually already ordered a couple shelves and poster frames, as well as some chalkboard paint for an area slightly out of view to help make things a bit more comfortable.  Rest assured though, that the recessed lights in the front are independent from those above the pool table, and so I don't get any wash out on the screen even with a large amount of light in the room.  The gray screen also helps with this too.  I'll have to post a picture if I do a followup because a lot of people seemed to be worried about wash-out.  The curtains are another one of those things that came with the house that I'm still working on what I want the ultimate solution to be.  If they didn't block the light so damn well, I probably would have tossed them as fast as the mustard yellow wall paint they had before.  I think once I've finished decorating the rest of the space in the next few months that they will be towards the top of my list for things to upgrade.

I tinker with the speaker setup here and there using the on-screen interface, but 95% of the time, I tweak and switch modes/inputs with the app.  In general this is a very easy system to set up and tweak.

hometheater,3cczrn,emptybob,1 point,Tue Jul 7 01:55:51 2015 UTC,"Run the YPAO, it does a pretty decent job of working out your speaker distance, but might set crossover incorrectly (check to make sure the crossover matches your speakers). I also find that I bump the subwoofer up by 1 (eg. if it's set to -2 I run it at -1).  Try the different surround decoders(sc-fi, spectacle etc.) and see if you like them.I personally keep mine set to 'STRAIGHT' for all inputs, but some people like the larger soundscape that other DSP modes create.  I think dynamic range is set to max by default and that is ideally where you want to keep it, but if you have neighbours/other people in the house that might not want to be disturbed by the noise, or of you find the difference between quiet and loud in your movies to be too much then turn the dynamic range down to a level you find appropriate.

Otherwise, I have been playing with everything. DRC confuses me. I want very little compression, so I always set it to low. I always forget it's opposite, so I'll fix that.

If you're going to use it in a theater setting, keystoning will cause noticeable distortion from what I understand.  Lens shift on the other hand will not change the picture at all and can give you significant flexibility.  As long as you have a projector with enough lens shift, there should be no problem having it off center.  Just keep in mind that this will limit options in the future if you ever want a new projector as well."
hometheater,3cb3pv,nickmdp,1 point,Mon Jul 6 15:20:37 2015 UTC,Ok so lens shift works for both height (ceiling vs floor) and also (let's call it) off center adjustment to avoid a trapezoidal image?  Thanks for clearing it up. I thought lens shift was just for height.
hometheater,3cb3pv,nickmdp,1 point,Mon Jul 6 15:22:50 2015 UTC,"There is vertical and horizontal lens shift. You're going to want to make sure your projector has horizontal shift, which I believe is slightly less common."
hometheater,3cb3pv,MojoMercury,1 point,Mon Jul 6 15:28:06 2015 UTC,Most lens shift is only vertical (up and down) but some offer horizontal (left and right) as well.  I would highly suggest getting a pro involved as measurements and specs will be crucial in pulling that off.
hometheater,3cb3pv,davdev,1 point,Mon Jul 6 21:27:50 2015 UTC,Most LCD projectors have lens shift but i dont know of any with such a range to be able to compensate for what you are suggesting. Normally it used to help with adjustments of a few inches  The benq is a dlp model and doesnt have lens shift so placement needs to be more or less exact

hometheater,3ccl3q,onlypawningameoflife,1 point,Mon Jul 6 21:25:55 2015 UTC,What's your budget? How large is the room?  Do already have the AVR/sub because all you mention is speakers? If you need an AVR/Sub does the budget include that? Are there space/size concerns that need to accounted for?
hometheater,3ccl3q,Armsc,1 point,Mon Jul 6 21:39:06 2015 UTC,"since also have to get them an a/v reciever would like to keep the speakers + sub probably under 500 total,  its a pretty large room say 800 sq ft with attached kitchen, really the main room of the house.  The Tv is mounted above a fireplace, there is about 12"" of room on either side of wall were speakers could be attached, floor standing would not work room wise."
hometheater,3ccl3q,Armsc,2,Tue Jul 7 00:12:45 2015 UTC,"Where are you going to locate the sub?  I guess what I'm asking is how much room are you going to have for it.  No sense in suggesting a sub that's not going to fit into your room.    As far as speakers go I'm going to follow the herd and recommend the Wavecrest HVL-1 for $200 a pair.  Why you ask...well they are supposed to sound amazing, they are affordable, and they are front ported.  That's a plus when wall mounting them.  If those are too big I would look at these Infinity 143 for $60 each."

The good:  Great fit, great sound, great range, great battery life, separate volume controls.  the bad:  Pain to get both units to synch. They've become unsynched twice and I had to resynch which took many attempts. Volume control and balance buttons are tiny and almost impossible to feel around for and they need to be on for you to hear the volume. Lastly, with one base station charging 2 sets there is a bit of battery life anxiety since you don't know how much charge each set has. Actually I've never run out of battery and you can always throw in a regular battery if one dies. Nonetheless, it would have been cool if they somehow could stack onto the base station and both would always be charging when docked.   They feel and sound great though so I'd still probably buy them again unless there was a base station that could multi charge. The buttons you just sort of learn with time.   Good luck!"

All it does it swap inputs, but it doesn't decode audio at all. I've been burned by this before too, and I was pretty irritated when I found out as it was way past the opportunity to return it.

Computers with optical audio out (which yours does not have unfortunately) will always do stereo output and can pass through existing Dolby Digital or DTS tracks from videos. If you want to game and get proper 5.1 surround sound you will need to pay a little more to get a sound card with DTS Connect, which encodes to DTS in real time. Unfortunately these are kind of hard to track down now (expect to spend $50+), and it's almost better to just pony up and get a new receiver ($150-$200) which will have much better features and sound quality."

Go with the 55in, but also look into how the contrast is on the televisions.

hometheater,3c6ozv,northern_crusader,2,Tue Jul 7 07:04:12 2015 UTC,Any reason you are picking those? That's a lot of money for not a lot of TV. Especially if you'll be viewing it at 3 meters.

hometheater,3c86pw,sharakov,2,Sun Jul 5 20:26:50 2015 UTC,"Receivers aren't typically designed for multiple monitors, but you can run DVI straight and the HDMI through the receiver. One issue will be lag time, the HDMI signal will be slowed down by having the receiver in the line. See if there is a delay option on the DVI card to see if you'll be able to match the slowdown."

hometheater,3c7h7y,poorscribbler,2,Sun Jul 5 21:22:06 2015 UTC,"Here is one you could look at. You wouldn't be able to use your sound bar because it only connects to two pairs of speakers and a subwoofer. This is a music-dedicated amp, though. If you want something for an actual home theater system that does 5.1, go with one of the two I recommended above. If all you're interested in is music, go with this one. Onkyo makes some stereo receivers in your price range, but after researching a little bit they tend to be pretty unreliable."
hometheater,3c7h7y,poorscribbler,1 point,Sun Jul 5 21:29:09 2015 UTC,If I went with that could I split the sound signal between the sound bar and the amp so that both receive the signal? If that worked I could control the sound levels of the sound bar and small speakers on my desk with computer volume and the speakers and sub with the amp.
hometheater,3c7h7y,PussySmasherMD,1 point,Sun Jul 5 22:12:04 2015 UTC,"I'm not certain you can use the soundbar as a passive center channel, either way. If I were you, I'd buy the Marantz receiver and set up a 2.0 or 2.1 system for now. Since you're in a smaller room, you probably won't need a center or surround, anyway. That amp is nice, and it will allow you to upgrade for the next few years, should you choose. I would go with 2.1, then buy a center channel later, and add your surround speakers after that. Even if you don't like that idea, there are at least two other set up options to choose from with that amp, and it provides you with flexibility for the future."

They won't take an HDMI surround sound signal and downmix to stereo. You'd have to rely on your source having stereo downmix outputs available, or you might only get the left and right channels, which wouldn't contain much dialogue."

hometheater,3c7290,jphccfc,2,Sun Jul 5 13:57:41 2015 UTC,If your receiver is getting a stereo signal it may support a muxing into full 7.1. Modes like Dolby Ex or any THX Movie expansions can fake it pretty good.

hometheater,3c66iz,000Destruct0,1 point,Sun Jul 5 05:20:33 2015 UTC,"Good point. I'd want to spend like $200-300, though I'd be willing to go as high as $500, which I realize is not a considerable budget. This room is small (like 25' x 25', with 9' ceilings; couch and TV on opposite walls), and while we do watch a good amount of TV, sound quality is only a factor to one of us, and that person isn't even that picky. Despite all of that, something just feels wrong about buying a boxed system."
hometheater,3c66iz,kiwimills86,4,Sun Jul 5 05:31:23 2015 UTC,"Here's what I'd do... start with this:  Receiver $250: http://www.accessories4less.com/make-a-store/item/marnr1403/marantz-nr1403-slimline-5.1-av-receiver/1.html#!specifications  A pair of these $80: http://smile.amazon.com/Micca-MB42X-Bookshelf-Speakers-Black/dp/B00E7H8GG2/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1436075505&sr=8-2&keywords=micca  And this center $80: http://smile.amazon.com/Micca-MB42X-C-Channel-Speaker-Tweeter/dp/B00HHFBEK6/ref=sr_1_6?ie=UTF8&qid=1436075505&sr=8-6&keywords=micca  This nets you a reasonable 3.0 system. You'll have passable bass and good, clear 3 channel sound for movies/TV. As your budget recovers you can pop for a small, high quality sub like the Martin Logan Dynamo 300 for $130.  If you truly want no wire surround you'll have to spend around $90 for a rocketfish wireless speaker kit and then maybe $60 for a pair of the Micca MB42 to use for surround."

hometheater,3c597f,MaceOfTanis,3,Sat Jul 4 22:37:52 2015 UTC,"If you are planning to go with a sound bar, I would forego the receiver.   A receiver would be better suited if you were planning to get speakers as well.   Think about it this way: a receiver ""receives"" all the inputs (your ps3, Xbox, etc) and sends the audio out to whatever speakers are hooked up to it, and then an hdmi cord sends video (and usually audio too) to your display (in your case, your projector).   I think if you are planning to have a soundbar only (which many people here will probably disagree with but I say to each his own), then a receiver may not be necessary, however it will depend on the inputs/outputs of your soundbar. If the soundbar has multiple inputs and a video output, then you can do exactly what you said, and run an hdmi from each of your sources (ps3 etc) to your soundbar, and the video from your soundbar out to your projector (again via hdmi). If your soundbar doesn't have multiple inputs, you can get an hdmi switch (check monoprice.com for all your cable and switch needs), and all of your sources can connect to this switch, and you can use the switch to choose which source gets sent (via hdmi) to your soundbar; you'd have to do this manually (i.e. the switch usually doesn't automatically switch sources by detecting what is turned on or whatnot, but most have a remote or something so you can do it from your seat). If your soundbar doesn't have a video output then it gets more complicated, cause you'd have to send audio from the switch to the soundbar and video to the receiver. There may be switches that have this feature but I'm not sure.   If you decided to get speakers, it gets easier, albeit more expensive, since all of your sources would go into your receiver and it would send audio to your speakers and video to your monitor/projector. Then you will use your receiver to switch sources (ps3 etc) that you want to see/hear."

Although you may want to consider separate speakers for a 5.1 setup later on but you can always change later.   I really like how The Wire Cutter does reviews and it looks like the second runner-up Yamaha YSP-4300 would be what you want.  http://m.thewirecutter.com/reviews/best-soundbar/ If this is too expensive or you have a low budget then just make sure the soundbar has at least 3 HDMI (I'd recommend 4) inputs and one output. You can also get extra features like Bluetooth or AirPlay too.
hometheater,3c597f,xraycat82,1 point,Sat Jul 4 23:46:38 2015 UTC,"You can get a set of mica mb42xs for $80 new, I found them for $50 used on Amazon. Then got an 8"" sub on Amazon for $109. And I had a cheap sub $200 2.1 system.   Added an audio receiver used for $60 which works well enough but doesn't have HDMI. So the TV switchs between HDMIs and cable with an optical audio out cable.   So while you just need an HDMI switcher you can probably find a cheap HDMI receiver locally or online that'll get the job done.   That cheap set up will destroy any sound bar and if you add a 3rd center channel down the line you've got a very inexpensive 3.1 system.   A sound bar also doesn't really fit into a 5.1 system getting some book shelf speakers is a much better investment.  I watches zeos videos and was able. To set everything up no problem it's not as complicated as I thought it would be. Very straight forward everything on audio systems is clearly labeled even wiring is simple. Don't be afraid of it."

Normally the audio is 'intercepted' on the HDMI passthrough.   A slightly older receiver might require you to connect your media play to the TV via HDMI, then rely on the HDMI ARC (Audio Return Channel) to get audio back to the receiver.  Even older would require audio via digital (fibre or co-ax) from the TV back to the receiver."

hometheater,3c4i56,e60deluxe,1 point,Sat Jul 4 21:32:02 2015 UTC,"Ok. you wont be able to do what you want with a typical sound bar. a typical sound bar is a self contained unit that does everything. if you add surround speakers to a sound bar they need to be made to match the sound bar model. if you get whole home audio the sound bar needs to support that function and they need to match brands/models, etc.   If you go that route i would suggest Sonos. but like i said, then you need to have Sonos everything, including either a sonos speaker or a Sonos amp for each room. the surround speakers need to be a Sonos speaker.   So my real suggestion would be to not focus on a sound bar. Sound bars arent a great idea for surround sound anyway. For a proper surround sound effect the front 3 speakers, Right, Left and Center need to have some separation from each other so that you can tell which direction the different sounds are coming from. That effect is diminished when all the speakers sit underneath the TV.   That being said, you can get whats called a passive sound bar which is not a self contained unit and requires a Home theater receiver (what im assuming you are referring to as a Home theater box)  From here, whether you use 3 separate speakers for the Front speakers or a Passive sound bar, the setup is the same.   Passive sound bar:  You will need a Home theater receiver, and you will also need a multi channel amplifier due to the number of rooms you want.  at a basic level, a multi channel amplifier will have on off switches and sometimes volume controls for each room. moving up a bit, you can install volume switches in each room.   Moving further up you can have control panels or remotes that can control each room from a central location or control all rooms from each room. and moving further up you can add smartphone control.  you can also make rooms play different audio sources, for example pandora in one room, but an ipod or aux cable source played in other rooms.   so it depends on the level of sophistication you need and the costs can go up A LOT.   look at some of the packages they have on HTD:  http://www.htd.com/Products/Whole-House-Audio  Next, for speakers i'm assuming you want in ceiling speakers everywhere except the patio which will probably use weather resistant outdoor speakers. so there are a lot of options there as well.   you can even go in wall for the front 3 speakers of your Home theater so that gives a clean look."
hometheater,3c4i56,peekay427,1 point,Sat Jul 4 22:17:40 2015 UTC,"I also wouldn't advise getting a soundbar. If it's just the look that they're going for, I think you could find a long, skinny center channel or, better yet get in wall center and L/R next to the TV. I wouldn't imagine that would be too hard to do, and with a wall mounted TV it would give you a nice clean look. However for the same quality, in wall speakers will cost a bit more. You might even consider a pair of nice towers with a good center. Sonus faber makes a beautiful L/R/C called venere (2.0 for bookshelf and 2.5 for towers if I remember right).  It might be difficult to get a receiver with that many different room outputs, but I didn't look into that so I'm not sure. But basically you'd have all your speakers connected to one receiver and you should be able to control which rooms are on/off from there. I would guess that any speaker that could power that many setups would have a decent phone app as well, but if not a decent universal remote would cover you if set up properly.  Sonos systems are a great option for a lot of what you're thinking of doing but... You already have speakers installed and if you went sonos you'd never be using those.  Edit - that whole house audio link that the other guy provided is perfect for your needs. I had no idea where to look for that."

hometheater,3c36i6,zim2411,2,Sun Jul 5 01:40:17 2015 UTC,"I saw an LG OLED a few months ago on the Best Buy showroom floor that had some image burn in. I'm sure it was because it was just looping the same demo for hours on end, but it was disappointing to see. I think it was the EC9300 but I didn't get a picture of it. I know it wasn't the most recent model though. It was also disappointing to see it on the main floor away from other TVs, and in a very glare prone spot. I expected to see it in the Magnolia section decimating every other TV around it with black levels, but no.  As per this review:   Speaking of gaming, input lag is an important factor when playing games on a game console. We measured input lag to 47 ms in the game mode and 141 ms with the calibrated settings.   Source  47 ms is okay, but for comparison's sake Sony has the best in class input lag with only 17 ms on their LCDs. If you really aren't watching any movies I'd say hold off on jumping into OLED at least another round or two of models. LG's panels are amazing but they always seem to botch the video processing side.

I helped a buddy with a cheap amazon one.  It was not easy to get up. It didn't feel secure until everything was locked down (and that was only after aiming).  Aiming was a pain because it didn't stay were you put it.  We also bent part of it at one point because the mound gave instead of moving.  So getting the image to be strait took forever.  To put it another way, it was a battle. I can have a Peerless (or Chief) up and aimed in less than 10 minutes.  A cheap mount you may fight with for an hour. A fight you have to have again anytime you take down and put up the unit (admittedly not often but even once is another pain) or when you get a new projector."

hometheater,3c2db1,germanplumber,1 point,Sat Jul 4 03:49:00 2015 UTC,The C series has some wifi issues w/ their smart features. I also find that the Samsung calibrates easier then the Sony. However out of the box the two models listed the Sony will look better.  A H(last years model btw) 6350 & a 800C are not close in being comparable range anyways. The JU7100 would be more of a comparison to the Sony W800

For the same amount of money you could get a much better quality TV. Like the Sony 630B, 800B, 850B. Samsung H7150, J6300.

hometheater,3bzp4w,kingrpriddick,2,Fri Jul 3 17:08:52 2015 UTC,I mean sure everyone can have bad experiences with all brands. But I wouldn't say Vizio is anywhere near the quality of the Sony or Samsungs. In picture or build. And budget 4k TVs are imo a waste of money right now.
hometheater,3bzp4w,kingrpriddick,4,Fri Jul 3 20:49:17 2015 UTC,"As a home theater guy, I usually would laugh at anyone's who would suggest to me that Vizio has stepped up in quality in 2014 and Samsung has stepped down in quality in 2014. However, the evidence I've run across, paired with other installers that I chat with, paired with my own experiences (and customer experiences) last year, I'd say that's exactly what has happened. Samsung is still having capacitors go bad in their sets. They've been great about warranty replacements and even free out of warranty replacements, but it's still a long standing quality control issue that shouldn't been resolved by now. Samsung's uneven backlighting and light bleed has gotten progressively worse on their recent model TVs, including sets that cost over $2000. There's no excuse for this. Vizio has created their own partial and full array led backlighting tech and implemented it into their panels, even the cheaper 2015 models. It really makes a big difference in picture quality. Vizio has also been doing much better with input lag lately. Although Sony really has their input lag minimized and the picture quality is beautiful, I can recommend a brand that doesn't care about quality control and warranty, ESPECIALLY when you thank to them on the phone. I agree with you on the budget 4k thing, that's just a marketing mess that's probably going to run into serious compatibility issues with 4k streams/signals become the norm."
hometheater,3bzp4w,scottvalentin,3,Fri Jul 3 22:00:42 2015 UTC,"Oh I would totally agree that Vizio has gotten better. Much better than they used to be. As a gamer I did notice their low input lag, but they have some motion blur issues that hurt them. Also with their bigger sets, 65"" and up, the input lag goes up to 70+ which is unacceptable.   I've had good luck with Sony products so I tend to stick close to them."

I recommend a Harmony remote if you don't have one.

So...what's the difference between Direct & ""Pure"" direct?  Pure direct also turns off the display lights.  This is to ""eliminate faint low level noise from creeping into sensitive analog circuitry"" (they're saying even the display lights can potentially affect noise).

It can be done, but you'll likely need a projector with a long throw lens, and since I'm assuming you'll have a moderate amount of light as well so people can see while swimming, you'll probably also need a fairly bright light source as well.  These things will definitely add cost to the projector, and $500 is already a tight budget for a good picture quality projector without those requirements.  Do you already have a screen and audio?  Those will surely add cost to the setup as well."

hometheater,3bzxlo,nickmdp,2,Sat Jul 4 03:11:24 2015 UTC,"I can't give you a great idea of how well it would turn out, but my advice would be to find projectors that you think will fit your budget, and use the calculator on the following site to get an idea of your placement options and how bright they might be: http://www.projectorcentral.com/projection-calculator-pro.cfm  Probably the most important number will be the lumens output in your case because I expect the lighting and makeshift screen to require significant brightness to be able to make out much detail.  The absolute minimum would probably be 2000 lumens, and I'd probably aim for 3000 in your situation.  Also make sure the projector has a zoom lens so that you can experiment with various screen sizes if you don't have a good return policy.  I expect you'll need a throw ratio in the 2-3 range.  That said, my personal opinion is that you likely won't get what I would consider good enough on that budget, and it seems like a half-baked idea.  There are too many compromises being made, and it's probably going to end up seeing very limited use if you do go through with it.  I don't mean to crush your ideas, I just don't think you should be under the impression that you'll be able to create something great.  If projector systems were easy and cheap, everyone would have them instead of TVs."

I would love to see such a solution within other environments, but they're really lacking as the article points out. These new speakers, in my opinion, don't go far enough, they're wayy too expensive for no good reason. We need more openess on the standard making cheaper solutions, before it can be accepted into the main stream.   Apple TV full audio and video receiver - $69USD Apple AirPlay audio (AirPort) receiver - $99USD  Shairport4w - free receiver for windows.

What a great way to distribute audio!  The non-Airplay devices are a joke.  As the article states, lots of different methods, most proprietary (which means big dollar for specific products - Sonus is very expensive).    Last month, I bought my first Apple piece ever.  I bought an Apple Airport Express.  Tiny little device with a 3.5mm aux output.  Put it anywhere in the house (uses wifi) and connect the aux output to any radio/speaker with aux input.  There are programs for Android AND Windows that allow you to send the audio to any (or all) the Airport Express units.  A new Airport Express costs $100, but you can often find them for $60 on e-bay.  Works like a charm.  And I don't need to spend major bucks since I already have plenty of radio's with Aux Input (Tivoli, Boston, Cambridge, etc).    Another beautiful thing is that the Airport Express's 3.5 mm output can send digital as well as analog!  So with a small adapter, you can send a digital signal to your receiver!    Google/Microsoft are WAY behind in this simple method of transmitting audio.  Even with this new Cast thingie.  WAY behind."

If it's coming through all 3 it's unlikely you will hear a difference. 99% of the dialogue should come solely through the center speaker.  Edit - Like the guy below me said you might have a setting wrong if you hear voices in all 3 speakers at the same time. I hadn't clicked on your links and I was assuming it was a crappier HTiB. Now that I see you have an Onkyo receiver it very well might be that it's set to a ""stereo"" mode and not the pro.

If you are getting sound, but it doesn't seem to be very clear there are settings you can do.  I changed from Onkyo to Yamaha, so I don't recall the exact settings anymore, but you can do a Dialog Adjust of some kind.  I'll do that now and then when I want the movie in general quieter, but need to deal with whispering dialog.  Makes the dialog really come out loud and clear without mucking with the rest of the movie audio.  You can also turn on DRC (Dynamic Range Control) to have the audio less extreme on the ranges.

I owned the same HT in a box and have the same receiver.   First off, the reason you're not hearing it like you'd expect probably has a lot more to do with settings than the speakers.    First, for DVD's or Blu-Rays, you want the setting set to PLII or NEO - they will sound the best by far. If not, then Theater is a good option as well.   It looks like you checked this, but run Audessy and then adjust the center until it sounds the way you'd think. About 90% of the dialogue and sound comes from the center for a movie, so you want to get it right.  Good luck and let me know if I can help."

If not, then Theater is a good option as well.   You shouldn't use PLII or Neo for 5.1+ sources. Both are intended to upmix stereo content to surround sound, but this is useless for native 5.1+ content. (I can't even enable those on my receiver if you feed it a 5.1 signal.) Leaving PLII on will just default to direct mapping when the receiver gets a 5.1 signal, and it will upmix if it gets a stereo signal though."
hometheater,3bvgm5,zim2411,0,Thu Jul 2 22:32:49 2015 UTC,"I have that exact same setup. I bought it a few years ago.  You want to set the receiver speaker settings for ""Small"" for front center,left,right. That is because the speakers are indeed small and do not have the physical capacity to reproduce the lower frequencies. So the receiver needs to send those to the subwoofer.  I gave the system to my parents. I think it is ok for the price.  As for your original question. If you can't notice the center that is good. The speakers should sort of blend in. You will want to just adjust for clarity as best you can in the setup with the speaker levels."

You need one that supports surround sound.   Edit: This will get the job done Or this It's on monoprice too  Check your TV audio settings to make sure you can select a surround output on the optical.

Their Lifestyle products, while admittedly sounding impressive for their size, do not constitute quality and are not worth the money. The Acoustimass 6 speakers are not an upgrade from your dad's Panasonic system because it's just not a good system. For $700 though you can get a system that will blow the Panasonic and Bose system away, you just need to do a little bit more research.   Would you buy a car from a manufacturer that doesn't tell you the mileage, or the horsepower -- and if you asked what it was, they just replied ""it's good enough?"" No! Bose does the same thing by never posting the frequency responses of their products. These are basic measurements that every speaker company provides -- even Sony provided it on what is unequivocally the worst home theater in a box ever made.

If your STB is going into the AVR then you don't need one.    I would suggest that you put you speakers on stands so that you can get a bigger soundstage vs just sitting them on the TV stand.  This will make things sound much better when watching movies as you're get that coming from the left or right more than if they are only the TV width apart.  Also agree with AJA that a sub will be in high demand for HT and probably music too depending on what you like to listen to.  The low end will just not be there with those 4"" drivers.

hometheater,3brq0z,Armsc,2,Wed Jul 1 20:41:55 2015 UTC,You really don't have much room to work with there. Since your speakers are so small the best you might be able to do is get some small wall shelves and mount them as close to the edge of the wall as able and right below the TV.

Yeah I would almost want to put them on stands just so I could move them out a couple of feet when watching a movie.  You would be surprised how much difference that can make on the way a movie sounds.  I know these stands have a fairly small base and should tuck into your little space nicely.  getting your speakers up a bit closer to the screen would be good too as the TV is a good bit lower.

hometheater,3brl17,IDontPlayBaseball,5,Wed Jul 1 16:08:47 2015 UTC,"Either the drawing is seriously not to scale, or there is a problem with the measurements.  The distance from the TV to the couch does not seem to match the wall with the TV is on.  Knowing the dimension of the wall on the left of the TV would help.  In general, for best stereo separation you want the distance between the speakers to be roughly the distance from each speaker to the listening position.  This would seem to indicate moving the speakers out from the wall the TV is on."
hometheater,3brl17,pcdude99,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:10:35 2015 UTC,The drawing is to scale (made in Visio).  The distance from the wall to the edge of the TV is roughly 3'.  The wall on the left (perpendicular to the TV) is about 7'.
hometheater,3brl17,raeanin,3,Wed Jul 1 17:25:45 2015 UTC,"Mains should be at least a couple feet away from any wall. Definitely don't put them in a corner or right up against a side wall.  The first placement is good, just bring them in away from the walls some. I would also recommend at minimum getting absorption panels  at your first reflection points since you don't have much width to work with.  For the rears, I would go with stands in proper 90deg position as a first choice, ceiling mounts at 90deg as a second choice, and rear wall mounted facing straight forward as a third choice. If you go with the third choice, I would recommend getting bipolars for the rears."

There also an interior wall to the left of the couches (maybe 10' from the couch parallel to the TV) that I can mount the other speaker in."
hometheater,3brl17,dkentmm,2,Wed Jul 1 17:36:47 2015 UTC,"I would def keep the front speakers by the screen, as in your second configuration. However, regarding the sub; just don't limit yourself to putting it in the corner. Be open to experimenting with sub placement (to the extent that you can, that is). You'd be surprised what a difference it might make to have it in the opposite corner (on the rear right). How much you hear/feel it might have more to do with comb filtering effects which will be affected by the construction materials, ceiling height, windows, doors,glass, etc. But my point is that you can minimize these comb filtering effects by just moving the sub around to where it, sounds, best rather than just where it looks best, or where it's just put of the way.  In any case. Enjoy it all!  May The Force be with you!"
hometheater,3brl17,DookSD,1 point,Thu Jul 2 00:06:29 2015 UTC,"I would do something similar to what I have done with my set up which is to move the TV OUT from the wall and closer to my seating.  What to do with the empty space?  I have filled it with tall, fake plants (I'm no good with live ones) which not only looks great, but helps tremendously in dealing with any sound reflections.  Unless you have a super large TV, moving it closer to your seating will be a big benefit.  The speaker set-up (front & center) would be in line with the TV or a little forward from the TV.  Rear placement looks good."

I could probably step up a bit if I wanted, but I'd probably need a brighter projector first.  My best advice would be to throw the image against the wall or a sheet without a real screen and use it for a week or two at various screen sizes and viewing locations for the same media that you would plan to be watching once it was finished (sports, movies, or games).  Maybe even watch the same movie/show on a few different sizes and see what you think.  I think the screen is one of the least often upgraded/changed pieces for a theater, so you'll want to make sure that you have exactly what you want rather than look back and wish you had gone bigger/smaller.  The site below also has a calculator for viewing angles with a few recommendations: http://myhometheater.homestead.com/viewingdistancecalculator.html  Other things to keep in mind are that a wide aspect ratio screen might work well on such a wide wall, and that if you end up with a ""small"" screen you can always move seating closer.  Also, even a ""small"" screen will likely be larger than 95% of the people you know."

I think it depends what you're going to be using them for. In my opinion I think they're fine for movies, and tend to be a bit harsh when listening to music, unless you like rock music in which case I think they preform well. All in all if they're in good shape for 400$ that's a pretty good deal. If you get a chance, demo them with whatever music you listen to most and decide if you like them or not for your self, that's all that matters in the end anyways. I don't know if you'll be able to find a better speaker in this price range unless you're willing to drop to just a  two channel."

That being said, Klipsch uses a horn tweeter which keeps the high end very compact and directional. This causes them to be to be pitchy and ear piercing. Where as a non directional speaker is softer and easier to listen to. Again though, audio is such a personal opinion, I have plenty of customer who love Klipsch and will only buy their products."

I can easily see it failing to make it to the regular consumer market until well in to the future when broadcast TV has died and streaming is the primary market. Even then, the data rate increase vs quality increase is not convenient for the typical user. It really only benefits those with projectors and ultra-large screen TVs.   It definitely has, and will continue to have commercial applications, but I think 4k will be the consumer standard for may years to come.  I find this to be a good thing, I would much rather companies put money in to improving picture quality first and foremost rather than a resolution race. Personally, I'm most interested in (reasonably)affordable ultra-lage OLED(or similar quality tech) panels (85+ inch). Until then, I'll stick with projectors."

hometheater,3bsmua,faceman2k12,1 point,Wed Jul 1 22:05:42 2015 UTC,"Once we hit 8k we are essentially at the point where resolution no longer matters.  It becomes irrelevant in the spec sheets, like the difference between a raster image and a vector image. At this point, we can imagine selling TVs by their pixel density, resolution could vary by size and it wouldn't matter. The higher density display would allow better scaling of non-native resolution content, as the artifacts of scaling are minimised.  If we go into the future a little, screens could be sold as rolls, that you can cover walls with, then you can have a TV of any size anywhere on that wall, you could enlarge the image for movies and games, or shrink it down to watch the news or a music display. The resolution of the whole display isn't relevant, only that a higher PPI means a better picture when scaling the image up or down.  Tech like that is still a ways off, but it is possible simply by scaling up current technologies.  In the near future though, we have factors other than resolution to improve.  Brightness, dynamic range, colour depth, frame rate, and of course things like better manufacturing yields, more reliable quality control (which seems to be a big issue for all TV companies at the moment), power consumption, weight and of course cost are all things that can still get much better."

Benq does quite well with their projectors on input lag.   Input lag. Like the W1070, the W1080ST measured a zippy 24ms (1.5 frames) of input lag using a 1080p signal over HDMI. That's fast enough for most gamers and not far from our best-ever measured time, which stands at 17ms (1 frame).   There are some high end projectors that while they offer unbelievably gorgeous picture quality, suffer from debilitating input lag that make them unsuitable for gaming, like the JVC-X500R.   In Cinema mode, with all additional video processing features disabled, the X500R measured 124 milliseconds of lag. That's quite high, equal to over seven frames of a 60 fps signal.

For instance, I found that even though I set my speaker distances as accurately as I could, my surrounds were actually reaching the listening position slightly before my mains, and at certain listening positions, sounded even louder than the mains.  By shortening the distance setting (increasing delay) of the surrounds, i can get my mains to reach the listening position just slightly ahead of the surrounds, creating the illusion of more volume up front.

Anyways. its my preference at the moment (that can change) so I am searching to see if there is a way to dial in the volume's of the two rear channel speakers about 10 or 15%.  Is there no way to keep the stereo mix by essentially having the mains and rears mirror each other, I thought thats what was already happening?"
hometheater,3bps18,Rumpelblumpkins,0,Wed Jul 1 15:52:25 2015 UTC,"I don't understand why everyone has to chime in with the 2.0 only bullshit like it is the word of God. If I have people over, am moving around the room, or am not doing critical listening 5.1 is fine. To actually answer your question, see if your avr has custom profiles that let you set the volume and eq of each channel. If not, I can't really think of anything other than installing some sort of hardware volume control between the receiver and your rear satellites so you can manually turn them down when you want to listen to music."
hometheater,3bps18,daevl,1 point,Wed Jul 1 12:40:02 2015 UTC,"for that case,playing it on A+B is the better choice."
hometheater,3bps18,Rumpelblumpkins,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:37:18 2015 UTC,What's the difference if you just have the left channel go to the rear left and vice versa?
hometheater,3bps18,daevl,1 point,Fri Jul 3 22:25:26 2015 UTC,Because the case you stated (listening to music in 5.1 ) means that you set the avr to 5.1. In that case it will upmix frequencies to  the rear channels instead of delivering the pure output of your source to another pair of speakers.
hometheater,3bps18,Rumpelblumpkins,1 point,Fri Jul 3 22:35:30 2015 UTC,Thanks for the reply. So you're saying it's removing parts of the music out of the main L/R channels and adding them to the back? Although I don't listen to 5.1 often i haven't noticed this. Can you define upmix?
hometheater,3bps18,daevl,1 point,Fri Jul 3 22:51:54 2015 UTC,"Each decoder,neo dts , pro logic II etc. Has their own upmixing profile. If you  dont notice any difference when playing music or movies while changing the output,dont bother at all. Idk your setup or ears but you should read into it."
hometheater,3boq3t,DaveDoesLife,4,Tue Jun 30 22:28:34 2015 UTC,"This won't make the picture bigger, but please consider this.   If you use black masking to cover up the unused parts of the screen, you will pretty quickly forget about the size and focus on the screen you're using.

hometheater,3boq3t,vi0cs,3,Wed Jul 1 04:26:08 2015 UTC,"How far are you sitting from the screen?  If the image takes up too much of your visual field, it can be disorienting. And you touched on it, but if you're below 1080p, you might have to size down a bit below the absolute max because the image can also appear jagged/blocky.  The size of the projected image has to do with the distance from the projector to the screen and the spread of the lens. Look up your particular model's throw distance calculator to see if you can make it bigger by moving it back or by dialing in the focal length.  I would probably get a different screen if I were you. For best performance, you'll need to match the size of the room (mainly distance from the screen) to the size of the projection to the size of the screen."

hometheater,3boq3t,bpeemp,1 point,Tue Jun 30 23:03:40 2015 UTC,Perhaps you can try buying black fabric that you use with adhesive to adhere it to the screen and make it a 10 foot screen? Alot of people do that when they have an old screen that was too large for their new projector.
hometheater,3boq3t,Minus-Celsius,1 point,Wed Jul 1 06:13:12 2015 UTC,"A 15' screen would be colossal.

That's the only way of increasing the picture size from here.  But the trade off will be a (much?) less sharp image and losing some brightness.  In the same situation, I'd look at 150"" screen, if the PJ can go ~15' back.  It's a good compromise between size and quality."

hometheater,3bmwhz,lmbb20,1 point,Fri Jul 3 14:59:30 2015 UTC,"Samsung has a 'game mode' in the 'settings' sub-menu. This turns off a lot of the set's processing and should significantly reduce lag. The downside are that the picture won't be quite as good and I don't think that it is assignable by input, so other sources that aren't consoles will also be affected. I recommend trying it without that mode first and only turn it on if the lag is too bad."

So in that case the bigger screen is better.   Two reasons for this.  Like anything with detail if you are too far away from it you can't see the detail, if your TV is too small you can't see the detail in your characters outfit.   I don't mean that they are wearing armour but the intricate designs and buckle work for instance would not be noticeable.   Secondly and the big reason everyone goes to movie theatres and pays the premium is the bigger the screen the better the immersion in the story."
hometheater,3bmwhz,Khtkiller5302,4,Tue Jun 30 15:07:41 2015 UTC,"Also, 1.2x is the THX recomendation which is  closer to cinema-like viewing angles IMO. Anything between 1.1-1.6 will be OK, depending on budget and how much immersion someone wants."

The one caution I have is if anyone who will watch it regularly gets motion sickness easily this can be a problem. I get motion sickness pretty easily, and I've found that when I've got a large screen and I'm too close to it that I will get sick. Generally it's when there is motion on the screen, but even with the way TV shows cut from shot to shot so quickly it can get disorienting and give me a headache.   If that's not an issue, I can't think of anything else and would say go for it."

CES next year, there will be several sub $5,000 4k projectors, and perhaps by Christmas time they'll be closer to that $3,000 mark. They will only get cheaper over time. 4k is still pretty young, but once Cable TV supports it, BluRay supports it, and it becomes more common, those projector prices will drop."

Sony debuted their first home 4k projector only 2 years ago and it cost about $30k. Now this year we have a Sony 4k projector costing about $8k. Thats in only 2 years.

hometheater,3boeq2,_____--_____,1 point,Wed Jul 1 05:48:17 2015 UTC,"No it varies from item to item. I believe that Sony products out class comparable models from other brands, hence my interest in their 4k projector"
hometheater,3boeq2,bXm83,0,Wed Jul 1 23:04:33 2015 UTC,4K stuff will quickly get outdated once 4K becomes the staple many advancements and standards will be made that outclass the early adoption stuff. This is something to consider as well.

hometheater,3boeq2,Minus-Celsius,2,Wed Jul 1 23:03:03 2015 UTC,"If it means anything, I had the Sony VPLHW50ES for a month and decided to return it, as the software seemed half-baked.  Options that were in the manual were nowhere to be found, and I was never able to get it to scale small enough to fit the screen properly.  Calls to Sony basically all ended up with them saying, ""well the option should be there, so...""  I'd suggest checking the throw ratio range on the projector and make sure it works with your setup, as I found Sony's spec pages lacking in that information when I first looked into it.  I ended up returning the Sony and going with the equivalent JVC, which had just been updated a month or two previous.  You could just go with the Sony, and sell it for a profit in a year or two if the value still holds, considering how large the discount is."

I'd put it at the top and hopefully it would be an acoustically transparent screen so you can put the center channel behind it as it should be. I would use external speakers because they are far superior to in wall speakers. I would use a projector, 1080p - 4k is years away from being relevant. I'd put them in the rear of the room to shorten the run to the projector, long speaker runs aren't as big a deal just use heavy gauge wire. I'd go with a 5.1 system."

I went with the following design (see below). I know it might not be AVS ideal, but I am thinking it could be workable for a novice HT guy. To be honest, my office is more important to me, as I work from home a lot. Does anyone see any glaring mistakes, or do you think this area can be worked out?  1.) Made closet nubs a little larger to accommodate rear speakers (1' 1"")  2.) Made entryway a lot more friendly by moving the wall to allow 1' 6"" clearance for front tower speakers. Door can open inward without hassle now.  3.) That small shelf area is still dead space, but the suit of armor stays   4.) AV equipment will be in the back closet. Running speaker wires, HDMI, coaxial to that location   5.) Projector will be mounted around 14' from screen (running power and HDMI to ceiling)  6.) Raised floor in rear 7"" (ceiling is 8')  Question: What size screen do you think I can pull off in the 10' 6.5"" area?  ANYTHING GLARINGLY WRONG that I need to tell them before tomorrow?

The wall away from the stairs. That way people are not walking in front of screen and you can keep closet. Use external speakers unless you want the clean look. They sound much better. I have in walls and they are good but If I had the room I wouldnt do them again. Yes projector. Dont even look back. If its not built yet you can have them run all the wires you need. 2 rows will work fine here. Use that little nook on the far right for the components? 5.1 is fine.

Could probably get a 100"" in there and still have 3' to spare for tower speakers.  I might move the entire niche cluster down a little bit and try to buy some more entry space at the door (maybe 6"") so I can get a tower in there.  Not elegant, but okay.  Put a center speaker on a table under fixed screen.  Put some center channels in side and then rear speakers.  Put the sub in the top left (screen wall).  And put a 7"" platform for second row of seats.  Can keep closet this way, and have a longer wall to work with (10' 1"" vs 10 6"").  Thoughts?"

hometheater,3bndyt,SterlingArcherCooper,5,Tue Jun 30 16:44:53 2015 UTC,"So you are sort of moving into the next level of complexity because you have more space to cover than is possible with a single device.  Basically what I would recommend is that instead of using a single consumer wireless router you move to using all separate components.    So you would start with a wired only router like this.  This would be the ""brain"" of your entire local area network.    You would then have two switches like this.  There would be one switch in your main house and one switch in your pool house with a network cable running back to the router from each switch.  You would plug all your wired devices into these switches.  Wired is always going to give you the best performance even if a device supports wifi.    You would then have how ever many wireless access points you need to cover your property.  These would then each plug into the closest switch.  You would need one in the main house and one in the pool house for sure, but you could potentially have one on each floor of the main house, or even an outdoor access point to cover the actual pool area.  This way you would have reliable wifi with a single SSID everywhere.  I know this is probably more complicated than you were originally thinking.  I just wanted to give you an option that would provide you with a reliable network connection.  There are wifi bridges/repeaters out there; however I think you will find you end up with a slow unreliable connection.  Head over to /r/HomeNetworking for more in discussions on stuff like this."

hometheater,3bp0c0,LexLuthor2012,1 point,Wed Jul 1 00:08:09 2015 UTC,"Well I can't give specifics without a budget but if you want a TV setup then you'll need 4 more speakers (two fronts, a center, two rears and two sides) and at least one subwoofer. Then you'll need a receiver, pick one according to the quality of speakers you decide on, not the other way around, and depending on what other media devices you get you may need a power manager or a even a UPS. You also need to decide on in wall or external speakers (personally I think the only advantage to in wall are aesthetics). Will your receiver and components be adjacent to the TV or will you have to do a wire run to a separate area? You could also go to a local best buy magnolia center and get a quick quote on some items without having to buy them there.

hometheater,3bnarx,HarmonicVibrations,1 point,Tue Jun 30 16:23:09 2015 UTC,"Are these speakers even worth my time and money? I’m not looking for a large serious setup, but one that still sounds good and that’s good enough for all purposes, music, movies, and gaming.    I have never in my life heard of this brand, and quickly looking them over, doesnt fill me with joy and happiness, looks like Chinese crap.  I am thinking they probably are not worth keeping around if you can afford something better   When I upgrade to the 7 channel receiver, could I buy slightly better (different brand) front left/right speakers and then use my existing channels for surround left/right and surround back left/right? Would the two new front channels sound okay with the existing Edifier centre channel? (I read somewhere it’s a bonus to have the three front speakers matching, is it true?)    You could use them as surrounds and see how they go.  Surround speakers dont need to be anything fantastic, however, all things being equal it is still better to match to your fronts.  You should not even think about using the center though.  It is critical to match the front sound stage.  You would be better off using no center than mismatching.   The speakers I own are the S550, the front left/right and back left/right are identical and are rated as follows… (D.C. Impedance: 8 ohms / Load Power: 32 Watts) The new upgraded S550 Encore speakers look identical to the ones I own but are rated differently… (D.C. Impedance: 4 ohms / Load Power: 60 Watts) So what’s the difference between the two? Are they indeed the same speakers?   Again, I know nothing of this brand, but published specs are relatively meaningless marketing fluff.  That said, I would pay attention to the impedence, and a 4 Ohm load can cause some serious damage to receivers that arent rated for it.  It is doable, but you would need to be very careful monitoring volume levels and heat of the amp.    For $600 I guarantee you can get much better speakers than those Encore things."

It doesn't really surprise me that you haven't heard of the brand before, I haven't either until I noticed that these are the speakers that go head-to-head with those Logitech Z-5500's that get praised so much.   On another note, I've been hearing the name ""Fluance"" around this sub recently and on other sites. For an entire surround system the price is very competitive, and it's definitely a system I'd consider since it's in my price range.   http://fluance.com/product/XL_Series_5_Speaker_Surround_Sound_Home_Theater_System_with_Bipolar_Speakers.eng-149.html  I'd get their XL series, but I just haven't heard enough to convince me. Thoughts?"
hometheater,3bnarx,000Destruct0,2,Tue Jun 30 18:01:30 2015 UTC,"The Z-5500 gets praised as a good computer speaker set, not as a main speaker for a surround system.  Fluance is now what Polk used to be. A company that uses quality off the shelf drivers in well made cabinets to produce good speakers at a reasonable price. A lot of the snobby enthusiasts turn their nose up at them but they are good speakers and, relative to more mainstream brands, give you a lot of quality for the price."
hometheater,3bnpgg,jeebidy,3,Tue Jun 30 18:06:22 2015 UTC,DTS:X is pretty much available with companies promising upgrades to certain models. But I say wait for OLED on the TV.
hometheater,3bnpgg,amalagg,3,Tue Jun 30 19:08:20 2015 UTC,Most units I've seen do both DTS:X and Atmos. I don't particularly care about either right now but if you intend to move to 4k I'd most definitely wait until the technology is a bit more mature and there is more native 4k media available. I wouldn't want to be depending on HDCP 2.2 chips since the ones on the market now had to be manufactured prior to the standard being finalized.
hometheater,3bnpgg,000Destruct0,2,Tue Jun 30 18:16:40 2015 UTC,"You'll always be chasing that Dragon, but HDCP 2.2 is a must have for 4k, otherwise you're already incompatible when it is fully enacted.   I'm personally waiting for HDR Tvs to be released, Vizio R Should be out by the end of the summer i believe. and there is the Samsung 9500F  http://www.cnet.com/news/high-dynamic-range-arrives/"

hometheater,3bnpgg,MiaowaraShiro,1 point,Tue Jun 30 21:16:13 2015 UTC,I've yet to understand how HDR isn't just marketing speak for a good contrast ratio. You might get a few more gradations between black and white but I somehow doubt anyone will really notice that difference.
hometheater,3bnpgg,bownfeis,1 point,Tue Jun 30 21:28:11 2015 UTC,"HDR to me represents a higher luminance level, which relates to a good contrast ratio.   We measure brightness of an output TV in ""nits"" which actually is a measurement of candles/meter, @1 meter measured a standard monitor outputs around 100nits, which is actually pretty dark. HDR Televisions expand out this, outputting more light, the Dolby Pulsar monitor outputs 4000nits, which is incredibly bright. Many consumer versions will output around 800-1000 nits, which is still very bright.   What this allows is a better contrast ratio, but also, you experience truly bright scenes as bright, instead of just being ""white"" it also allows you to better increment between black and white.   Where a 10 bit signal has 1024 steps between black and white, when you map that to 100, those steps are so miniscule differences that you end up losing contrast between, becoming a relatively grey mush.  As hard to fathom it is on an SDR monitor, if you get the opportunity to side by side HDR v SDR (Standard Dynamic Range) the difference is phenominal. Bigger than HD to UHD 4k, more detail is unleashed from the image, and you save so much information.  HDR Is a very big leap in presentation, Things look much more ""real"" better than 3d, better than 4k, HDR is big."
hometheater,3bnpgg,MiaowaraShiro,1 point,Tue Jun 30 22:00:42 2015 UTC,I'm guessing HDR requires content to be coded for it?
hometheater,3bnpgg,bownfeis,1 point,Tue Jun 30 22:05:01 2015 UTC,"Yes and no, I'm sure some televisions will interpolate levels to output peak luminance the TV is capable of, so you'll get the full brightness of the television, but there are technologies out there like Dolby Vision that will have specifically encoded streams for HDR. Sony Has their own as well as Samsung.  Mastering for HDR is more like mastering for sound, you choose how ""loud"" your brightness is for the content instead of just saying this is white and this is black, so the mastered for HDR content will likely look the best."
hometheater,3bnpgg,000Destruct0,1 point,Tue Jun 30 22:54:56 2015 UTC,"You'll always be chasing that Dragon, but HDCP 2.2 is a must have for 4k   I don't think you understand my statement. The chips in current receivers had to be manufactured prior to the standard being adopted. I wouldn't trust that and would rather wait for the next generation of receivers that will use fully compliant/post standard chips."
hometheater,3bnpgg,bownfeis,2,Tue Jun 30 18:44:31 2015 UTC,"Even when HDCP 2.2 has been finalized, it will still be called HDCP 2.2, so no matter what you have to get HDCP 2.2, some players sell products with ""HDCP 2.2"" in them, but theres no guarantee a firmware upgrade would bring it up to snuff with the actual recommendation. I think we're seeing eye to eye and not disagreeing."
hometheater,3bnpgg,000Destruct0,1 point,Tue Jun 30 19:19:30 2015 UTC,"Not really, what I'm saying is I wouldn't recommend pre-standard 2.2 units and  compliance is not guaranteed. I'd wait for second gen when the chips are fully compliant."

Glue: The glue is attached to the paper/paint on the wall.  The glue won't fail but that paper/paint combo will peel/rip off.   It is adding strength to the combo though."

hometheater,3bmr0e,direwolf08,2,Tue Jun 30 16:25:07 2015 UTC,"Ditto what everyone else has said about toggles or drywall anchors. The paint/paper on top of the drywall will fail, not the epoxy. Those togglers are made to hold >100 lbs in 1/2"" drywall!"

Yeah OK that makes the most sense of any layout. What else are we talking about here...  Screen size. I always recommend as big as you can go BARING IN MIND you want to place either towers or speakers on speaker stands/wall mounts to the left and right of the screen. I do not recommend all three speakers be behind the screen as that is not where the sounds in those channels originates. So assume about 2' per side and use www.displaywars.com to work out your screen size.  I think there should always be a ""center"" seat up front. Best seat in the house so if you go 3 wide up front you can do either 3 or 2 wide in the back but you have to worry about heads lining up. A stepped platform used for rear seats can raise people up but you have to take a huge hump happening in the rear 1/4 of the room into consideration. Putting the couches all the way back against the wall 20' away may be detrimental to both sight and sound in such a narrow room. In fact once you determine the size of your screen use this to determine where the head of a person in the front row should start. You can fudge a little but not a lot.  This is what is going to determine your projector placement. Pick projector and insert screen size. It should give you a distance range if your projector has a zoom function."

Is that possible?  If I can use all 10' 1"" of the wall, do you think a 110"" screen is too tight?  (95.87"" width, 53"" height)  3.)  Is it awkward to just put the second row of seats on a platform, but not build out the entire second half of room?  4.)  haven't bought anything yet.  Will need to ballpark projector for electrician."
hometheater,3bkuxa,CoupleTryingGWout,1 point,Tue Jun 30 16:39:09 2015 UTC,"If you wanted to hide the speakers what you would do is frame the ""wall"" with 20 or 24"" spaces and instead of sheetrock you use an acoustically transparent fabric over the whole wall and then mount an AT screen over it as well. Then you can put a bunch of acoustical dampening foam in the not seen space and all the speakers back there. Just make sure you devise a way to go back there and move the speakers around etc.   110"" is about the norm. I think you can fit it.   That platform question is one you have to think about. Nothing wrong with making a small platform for just the seats and the step up in front. Could even put it on wheels to roll around if you wanted.   Look at 2-3 models of projector. Use the calculator. Find the average."
hometheater,3bkuxa,Toysoldier34,1 point,Tue Jun 30 18:44:04 2015 UTC,"I just met with an AV company nearby and they thought we should do this:  1.)  Use the top wall (non closet wall) for screen.  Could probably get a 100"" in there and still have 3' to spare for tower speakers.  I might move the entire niche cluster down a little bit and try to buy some more entry space at the door (maybe 6"") so I can get a tower in there.  Not elegant, but okay.  Put a center speaker on a table under fixed screen.  Put some center channels in side and then rear speakers.  Put the sub in the top left (screen wall).  And put a 7"" platform for second row of seats.  Can keep closet this way, and have a longer wall to work with (10' 1"" vs 10 6"").  Thoughts?"
hometheater,3bkuxa,CoupleTryingGWout,1 point,Tue Jun 30 20:44:55 2015 UTC,but /u/fleaflyflu mentioned that I need space behind the screen (Im a noobie at this).  I cant move the door (though I could consider removing it).  How big of a deal is this?
hometheater,3bkuxa,CoupleTryingGWout,1 point,Tue Jun 30 13:24:30 2015 UTC,"What do you mean remove the door? Then your only way in would be  from the stairs?  The door is definitely in a bad spot for the theater is you want a screen on that wall.  10 feet isn't super wide to begin with so you'll want your towers pretty much in the corners (where the door is really).  And why do you need space behind the screen? If you're going with an acoustically transparent screen and place your speakers behind the screen then I agree otherwise the screen is on the wall, no need for space behind it.  How many seats do you need?  Personnally I'd put the screen between the two windows and face the other way but that way you can't have a very large couch or you're blocking your entrances"
hometheater,3bkuxa,nellis_island,1 point,Tue Jun 30 13:44:38 2015 UTC,"I forgot to mention there is a small pocket door connecting my office and the Home Theater at the 3' 6"" mark near the stairs.  Would it be better to kill the closet and put the screen on the far left side?  Seating for 4-6 would be ideal."
hometheater,3bkuxa,nellis_island,1 point,Tue Jun 30 13:56:35 2015 UTC,"If you don't need that closet space (which, being a new home owner, seems impossible lol)  Then yeah I think the screen would fit better on that side, you have more room from the entrance for the speakers.  For a very clean setup, get a screen like this and place it pretty much where the closet doors are now, get 3 identical towers for your fronts behind the screen, put all your AV behind the screen.  All you'll need to wire out of there is an hdmi to the projectof and the 2 (or 4) surround speaker wires."
hometheater,3bkuxa,Toysoldier34,1 point,Tue Jun 30 14:18:38 2015 UTC,"Awesome, thanks!  What would be my ideal amount of space to make the closet width?  Can you tell me where to put seating and projector?  Thank you so much!!!"
hometheater,3bkuxa,Toysoldier34,1 point,Tue Jun 30 14:24:52 2015 UTC,"Seating I'd probably put the first row about 10 feet away (the heads) so about 8 feet for the couch, but that should be the last thing you determine, sit in the room and figure out what a good distance and go from there.  If it's going to be carpet and you want the riser to be covered too, wait til you screen and projector is installed to do that part.    Projector it depends on which projector you land on, use this link to figure out how far it needs to be, it's going to be about over the heads of the first row I would guess.  Closet needs to be at least 20 inches deep, standard av receiver is going to be about 15 inches deep so you want to give yourself some space for cables and everything.  What's listed on the plan is good to be honest.  Surrounds are going to be on the walls next to or a little behind your head, it's going to be tight to have the second row be in front of those because you can't really put them further back because of the window."
hometheater,3bkuxa,Toysoldier34,1 point,Tue Jun 30 14:56:37 2015 UTC,Would you make closet less deep to allow more space in room. Closet not built yet-
hometheater,3bkuxa,Toysoldier34,1 point,Tue Jun 30 15:05:29 2015 UTC,"That's what I was saying, maybe 5 inches but not much more than that, you need minimum 20 inches.  We're still saying closet but really don't have them build a closet, save some money there, the screen I sent you is as wide as the room, think it might be 1 inch too big actually (builders can accommodate easily).  Put that on the ceiling and leave it down pretty much all the time"
hometheater,3bkuxa,Toysoldier34,1 point,Tue Jun 30 15:15:31 2015 UTC,"So go with 20"" or keep at 25""  Every inch in this room will count unfortunately. I have no problems with permanent screen, as this room won't be for anything else."
hometheater,3bkuxa,romanomnom,1 point,Tue Jun 30 16:34:28 2015 UTC,"Also all this can be done on the other side if you kill the door.  So basically what do you want more, a door or a closet."
hometheater,3bkuxa,romanomnom,1 point,Tue Jun 30 14:23:55 2015 UTC,"I would say get rid of the closet all together. In the least put a shelving unit or move the closet to the other side.

hometheater,3blis6,Bill_Money,1 point,Fri Jul 3 00:20:50 2015 UTC,"I've had this TV for over 6 weeks now and I love it.  I immediate side loaded Kodi onto it and it plays everything I throw at it beautifully.  Android TV is still buggy but supposedly a huge update is coming from Sony in the next couple weeks.  That will all get worked out in time.   Picture quality is astounding and the physical design is minimalistic and elegant.  I have the 65"", which is direct lit, and my screen uniformity is excellent across the color spectrum.    Sure, the x930c is better, but it's also in a different pricing tier.  With an EPP discount, I got the 65"" for $2,300 compared to $3,600 for the x930c.  And Amazon had the x850c for 2,200 recently as a normal sale.  One could make the case for the Samsung JS8500 which is still more but close in price.  It is $3,000 and supports HDR though is edge lit.    I think the x850c hits a real sweet spot in the market right now.  It's just a solid TV, at a solid price with no gimmicks or crap you don't want (like speakers).  It has all of the same video processing as its bigger siblings the x930c and x940c, as they all use Sony's new X1 chip.   And as Android TV matures it's going to be amazing.  Don't confuse buggy with bad.  Even with its current quirks, it's still incredible.  The app availability is solid, and I love the guide that you get even for OTA channels.  4k Netflix and YouTube look unreal.    And FWIW, one of the things that really sold me on this TV is how accurate the color accuracy and motion is out of the box.  Minor tweaking (not much is needed on the Cinema settings) and it's golden.  One thing I didn't like about the new Samsungs is that they look really over the top bright and saturated out of the box and you have to spend more time calibrating."

hometheater,3bl5f8,thehaguys,1 point,Tue Jun 30 13:32:32 2015 UTC,"Someone may correct me but I believe 3.5mm is analog audio which produces stereo sound, whereas the optical audio port is digital audio with up to 5.1 capability, also I think digital is considered a higher quality due to less noise interference among other more detailed things. If you read the stuff on the sidebar you know soundbars aren't recommended cuz they can't be upgraded and just aren't that great for as hard as they are pushed to consumers.  If you're still open to suggestions look into getting a refurb denon (just a recommendation not a mandate) 5.1 receiver on accessories4less and  pair of micca mb42x, should come in a little over $200 for a great sounding 2.0 setup that gets even better when you have a enough to add a sub, and potentially make it a whole 5.1 down the road.   If you're kinda set on a soundbar, the one I have for a small bedroom is the Vizio s3821w, 2.1 with wireless sub. Gets the job done for me with the features you're looking for, also it's usually on sale on Costco's website for a good price (don't need to be Costco member to buy). I think it's like $150, I really wouldn't spend much more than that since the sound quality doesn't improve on these things much until you spend way more. But again just know this an end game purchase, no flexibility or customization"
hometheater,3bkms1,RemmyNHL,2,Tue Jun 30 00:13:57 2015 UTC,Most of the heavy lifting will be done by the amp in the subwoofer. You don't need a ton of power.

The js7100 does not handle motion or colors especially well either.   Having said that, you would need to sit pretty close to a 55"" to notice the resolution improvement during viewing. The HDR could definitely make it worth it since apparently HDR content is already available to Samsung owners.   http://www.avsforum.com/forum/286-latest-industry-news/2038802-hdr-m-go-four-films-fox-first.html"

That differs for people, I know some will keep a receiver until it fails to power up while others change once a year. I tend to fall into the middle somewhere in that I tend to upgrade my receiver every 3 years or so.  I don't expect 4k to be worth investment for at least 2 years. By that time technology and source material should catch up enough and the standards should be stable enough that I'd consider moving to it assuming I had a large enough screen and sat close enough to derive a real benefit over 1080p."

The only way to get something truly better would be to move to an Oppo and I can't see where you'd benefit from that.  As an aside, I'd avoid those HTiB systems and piece together a receiver and speaker system. To get what's in that system might take a little longer (you probably will have to get the receiver and 2.1 speaker system to start then add to it as your budget permits) but  you'll end up with a far superior system.  Personally, I'd look towards Marantz, Denon, or Yamaha pretty much in that order in your probable price range. Onkyo has had too many QC issues for me to be comfortable with them and besides, their auto room calibration sucks balls."

The PS4 is as good as any mainstream blu-ray player, not sure why you are having so many lip sync issues. I  use a Panasonic DMP-BDT360 and it doubles as my streaming source as well.  If a manufacture produces good electronics they don't produce good speakers. Yamaha at one time was an exception to that rule but that was decades ago.  I don't know how prices transfer since you have VAT to consider. I'd think the Denon AVR-X1100w would be a good choice. As for speakers, I really don't know the market there although I do know that Wharfdale makes very nice speakers and many at reasonable prices. Whatever speaker you choose make sure it either has a matching center channel or can be purchased individually to be used as a center channel.

Best path, at least in my opinion, is to purchase the best pair of speakers you can afford and purchase the sub at a time when your budget has replenished.   I say this because your budget is not enough to do both. A good pair of speakers will produce enough bass to be livable until you can get a subwoofer. Make sure any speaker you purchase either has a matching center channel or is of a size that you can purchase a third and use it as a center channel.

However at launch it couldn't even play 3D blu Rays. They've since fixed it, but I also got the lip sync issue with mine, as have a lot of other people. As you said, disabling 1080 24p output seemed to fix this, for some titles at least, but you shouldn't have to do this and ideally I believe you want it in 1080 24p. Some titles flat out refused to play, transformers 4 comes to mind. No matter what I did the audio skipped and it just wouldn't play properly. Went out the next day and bought a stand alone Sony blu Ray player, 6200 I believe.  Haven't had any issues with it, can do 1080 24p just fine, and comes with an actual remote!  Maybe they fixed the ps4 playback with firmware updates but I haven't bothered to try again.

I'm not totally clear on what you're trying to do with this.  I get bang for the buck but are you going about it the wrong way round.  If you want cheap 5.1 get either of the monoprice set or a yamaha set for $130.  If you want better speakers that's cool but keep in mind that you'll need to get the front three.  I still think my above link is the way to go.  That way you're getting the sub and surrounds for $80 and the front three for $150.  The fluance will sound much better than the monoprice basic set without even trying.
hometheater,3bgv75,rajrondo,7,Mon Jun 29 02:49:04 2015 UTC,"Don't.  Just don't.  You'll never reduce the thump to the point your neighbors won't slash your tires.  A much better apartment solution is to get a nice pair of headphones like ATH-M50x.  http://www.amazon.com/Audio-Technica-ATH-M50x-Professional-Monitor-Headphones/dp/B00HVLUR86/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1435550982&sr=8-2&keywords=studio+monitor+headphones  Nice flat response, amazing bass.  And you can crank them as loud as you like and keep your tires in one piece."

hometheater,3bgv75,mister_skippy,-1,Mon Jun 29 14:29:42 2015 UTC,"10/10 on the disagreement scale. I have had a 6"" sub for 7 years, no complaints. It's not a great sub by any means, but no way would I watch movies with headphones on.  You could probably do pretty well with lots of sound deadening and decent studio monitors up front. Otherwise, 6"" subs can fill that gap while nor destroying your neighbors quiet time."
hometheater,3bgv75,peteftw,2,Mon Jun 29 04:29:39 2015 UTC,"I speak not as the person who owned the subwoofer, but the downstairs neighbor of that person.  And as the person who ended up calling the landlord.  Had the LL come over one evening to hear it herself.  My upstairs neighbor wasn't very long for their location.  And we were renting in condos with thick cement floors between the units.  Not just I-beam and glu-lam construction.  The sound comes through.  Period.  So if you don't mind a landlord fight, knock yourself out.  As to the 6"" sub.  It's not that it's not bleeding through.  It's that the neighbors are deaf or just don't mind it.  But they CAN hear it."

hometheater,3bgv75,w_a_w,3,Mon Jun 29 15:53:26 2015 UTC,"Generally, subwoofers and apartments aren't a good mix.  But a lot depends...how thin are your walls?  Neighbors below and/or above you?  Are you gonna crank it up or just want a fuller sound at low volumes?    Subwoofer placement is a KEY FACTOR!  Due to the long low frequencies and their interaction in the room, your neighbor could actually be hearing more bass than you!  In my friend's apartment, I hear his subwoofer better when I'm in his restroom than his living room :-)  We changed the location of the sub and now it sounds better in the living room and you can't feel is as much in the bathroom compared to before.    There is a lot to study on this.  And forget about those Auralex pads.  They won't do a thing about keeping the sound from the neighbors.    Also consider something like a MaxxBass psychoacoustic bass enhancer.  They are rare, but you may find a device on e-bay that uses the MaxxBass system.  It's absolutely fantastic.  Basically, it alters the harmonics of the lower frequencies to trick your brain into thinking it's hearing much more bass than is actually there!  And your neighbors won't hear it.  Read up on it.  It's fascinating.  And it works!  Awesome for apartment dewellers.  I have one made by Artcoustic and will say it's very impressive:  http://artcoustic.ru/pdf/DBO%201%20bass.pdf"

Although I may just leave my whole set up at my parents and just get an upgraded 5.0.2 system to make up for it :D  Tl;dr Sorry man, you are going to have to go subless. Bass just carries too far.

hometheater,3bgv75,brkdncr,1 point,Mon Jun 29 06:02:09 2015 UTC,"Nearfield OB sub. H-frame or something. It wont pressurize the room like normal speakers do, and keeping it nearfield focuses the bass where its more needed.  Tho, be aware. Even tho it doesnt pressurize the room, that wont stop it ""leaking"" into your neighbours apartements. But it will be reduced alot."

Yes, it will be better than any other 200 dollar projector, but there are several things to be careful about if you intend to use it regularly:   You'll likely need a new lamp. By the time you replace the lamp, you could have a brand new 720p or possibly even a 1080p projector for not much more money. The color wheel may be on its last legs on a unit this old. It's not a true 16:9, so HD format programming will never utilize the full available resolution or you'll have portions of the picture that will be chopped off."

They seem to be the go to speaker in that budget range at the moment.  Here are a few options that I would consider.   Wavecrest $200 + BIC F12 $190 +speaker stands $45 and you're in business.  Good speakers, decent sub and money left for cables, wire, ect. Def Tech ProCinema 400 $490  This gets you a nice 5.1 in one shot.  Smaller sat sized speakers if that is your thing.  Sub is on the small size but for you sized room it should be fine. HSU STF-2 $320 + Fluance set $150  This gets you good sub with a decent 3.0 set.  You use the surrounds as mains until you can get a pair of matching SX6."

hometheater,3bgbde,smadwookiee,2,Sun Jun 28 23:45:03 2015 UTC,"To kind of answer your question, I would say since you are using 4ohm speakers, make sure any AVR you are looking for is actually rated to handle a 4ohm load and save yourself the hassle. My belief is that unless you are driving massive speakers at reference levels or in a huge room, a good AVR is all you need. The major advantage to me is that you could keep your amps forever and update processors and add channels as new standards are introduced, although that's negated by the fact that most surround processors are more expensive than high level AVRs. If money (and neighbors) were no object would I get separates? Of course. I likes me some toys, but not for any practical reason."

Thanks again for your help."
hometheater,3bce3q,leroydamus,2,Sun Jun 28 20:31:57 2015 UTC,"They are absolutely amazing. One of the best purchases I've made for my Home Theater. They add an entirely new level to your content. Yes ,you need a separate amp. You then plug them into the sub2 channel on your receiver, or you can split it off of sub1 if your AVR only has one sub pre-out. I use a Behringer iNuke 3000DSP with a custom filter. I also cut and soldered in a different, quiter fan.      If you're interested in getting them. Call up Crowson and ask for Randolph. Say Randy sent you. :)"
hometheater,3bce3q,anonnon,2,Sun Jun 28 20:41:06 2015 UTC,"Thanks! ill give them a call. A few last questions, how many of them did you get for a couch like the one you have on the picture? is it 4? can that amp drive them fine? can i get 2 to try it out and then add on more later? these go under the legs of the couch not under the couch like bass shakers, right?  Did you remove the legs that the couch came with and replaced them with those + the pucks or did you just mount everything on top of them? Sorry about bombarding you with questions, I really appreciate the help! I might be bugging you about the custom filter and the fan later, luckily I'm pretty good with a soldering iron."
hometheater,3bce3q,anonnon,1 point,Sun Jun 28 22:21:35 2015 UTC,"http://imgur.com/a/RNZE7 < The soldering is really easy, there's an album I made.      I use two currently. You can add more on later if you need, 2 is more than enough for me. If you plan on upgrading, you might want to get the iNuke6000DSP. But two is seriously plenty, I think. These move A LOT. It depends on your seating, though. You'll be running the amp in bridged mode, so you'll want to keep the tranducers to an even number. For example 2 @ 4ohms.  I have one at the back right leg, and then one under a bit of the chase and the other corner of the straight piece on that couch, if that makes sense.      You have two options, you can either apply them to your current legs, or remove your legs and use the isolation pucks. For my application I removed the wooden factory legs on the couch and just used the pucks."

hometheater,3bf0ii,homeboi808,5,Sun Jun 28 17:05:14 2015 UTC,"D65 is the white point for rec709 and currently proposed for rec2020, so if you want the most accurate image reproduction you'll want to always watch at d65. The recs are common for broadcast,dvd and blurray, set top boxes and streaming  I forget what it is, perhaps d60, but an alternative is used for theaters for a color space called p3."
hometheater,3bf0ii,bownfeis,1 point,Sun Jun 28 23:15:04 2015 UTC,Thanks for the informed response. Do the theaters use a different color space/white point because they are 4.2.0 and Blu-ray is 4.2.2?
hometheater,3bf0ii,bownfeis,1 point,Sun Jun 28 23:30:30 2015 UTC,"Most theatre use the alternative because of the bulbs used in projectors, particularly the xenon bulbs, tend to have a bluer appearance, this is because they physically create hotter light, similar to the difference between tungsten light bulbs and day light, making the white point at d60 or so, makes the appearance what we consider white. If you have Photoshop and select under p3 or cinema under the color matching option, and Paint what you consider white, (255, 255, 255 values for rgb), the effect will be bluish. That's because the setting for a computer and tv/monitor is usually rec709.  Theaters commonly use rgb 4:4:4 for color sampling, 422 and 420 are common for broadcast, 422 is typically referenced for yuv/ycbcr color sampled, but primarily is focused on how often a color sample is changed, imagine having a 4x4 pixel map, 444 means that each pixel gets a unique value of Luma, chroma, 422 means that each pixel has a unique luma value, but the chroma is utilized twice over two pixels and row of pixels. We rarely notice the difference in chroma because we have less receptors for color than we do for luma, we'll notice the degradation of of luma much quicker"

hometheater,3bf0ii,shrivel,3,Mon Jun 29 00:46:38 2015 UTC,The cinema/movie preset is the closest to D65 but its not perfect. Using anything else for any hd sources is not correct. Rec 709 is what all hd sources currently uses. You need a meter to measure your white balance to calibrate it.
hometheater,3bf0ii,gr3yh47,1 point,Mon Jun 29 00:06:27 2015 UTC,"Depends on your preferences - D65 produces a pretty warm picture, which I find is good for movies and TV, but looks kind of bland with video games.

From general surfaces that work in wide variety of applications, or specialized surfaces that are built for specific needs.  Like high gain, better contrast, ambient light rejection, 3D, viewing angle, and other considerations.  If you want the best you need to pick the best for your room/application.  If you need ambient light rejection then Black Diamond is another brand to look at.  Black Diamonds are high end if you need it (but that feature can drastically reduce the optimal viewing cone, always tradeoffs)."
hometheater,3bet88,rook218,1 point,Sun Jun 28 15:58:01 2015 UTC,That should work.  I would suspect that $7 switch is the culprit.  Try each device with the audio extractor on its own.  I think you will find they all work well.  If not then think about a better audio extractor and a new switch.  If you don't want to do a receiver then invest in better quality components you do need.

My ps3 works great, but my ps4 has some connection troubles that I've just had to learn to deal with by holding my controller a bit higher than usual.    That said, I would still rather have that than deal with having all the equipment in the room with me.  No extra lights or noise, and just overall more pleasing than trying to find a spot to put half a dozen or so pieces of electronics.  Also none of it can be damaged in some sort of accident, and you can set up your devices in a way that makes it easy to do maintenance.    Having everything in a rack means changing around cables is a breeze because it is completely open.  I've seen and had too many systems where trying to fix a problem or adding new hardware meant trying to plug in cables without seeing the inputs, or needing to pull out the entire receiver just to switch a couple things around.  If going this route, be sure to keep things like cable management and cooling in mind before you have the entire system built.  Last but not least, I love my Harmony remote, and it can do everything short of turning my ps4 on (really not sure how they dropped the ball on that, but oh well).  I probably get close to 50 feet of range on it through a wall, and it rarely has any issues."

hometheater,3bc37n,nickmdp,1 point,Sat Jun 27 20:17:54 2015 UTC,"Do you only have one cable that you switch between those devices?  I think trying a different cable is definitely a good idea, and possibly trying a different input (if available) on the projector itself.  Is there a receiver in the middle as well?  If so, try connecting it directly to the projector.  There's clearly a problem somewhere in the HDMI chain, and it's just a matter of going through them one by one to test.  More of a minor point, but why have such a large screen if you're only going to use 85% of it?"

hometheater,3bc1n5,Bazzmania,1 point,Sat Jun 27 20:21:41 2015 UTC,"Since at 45 Hz, it's down 6 dB, you should definitely cut off higher, 55 Hz at least.  THX recommends 80 Hz for home theater applications.  You can play around with these settings, try 60-100 Hz and find out what sounds best to you.  According to SVS's Merlin, 80 Hz is recommended for home theater and 60 Hz is recommended for 2-channel applications for your Chanes where you're running the speakers full range: http://www.svsound.com/merlin"
hometheater,3bc1n5,DieselWang,1 point,Sat Jun 27 20:11:44 2015 UTC,"Ok, so you are saying my speaker freq range does not matter when setting the sub? I live in a small apt btw so have a simple 2.1 setup and dont really need to play very loud"
hometheater,3bc1n5,DieselWang,1 point,Sat Jun 27 20:13:20 2015 UTC,"It doesn't matter as long as your speakers can play low enough to meet the subwoofer at the crossover frequency.  Your Chanes are relatively flat (+/- 3 dB) down to 55 Hz, so anything above this would work well (and below 80-100 Hz, where bass is generally regarded as being able to be localized)."
hometheater,3bc1n5,Armsc,1 point,Sat Jun 27 20:43:21 2015 UTC,You have to play with it to figure out what works best in your location.  Normally you want to choose a frequency above the stated low frequency cut off.  In your case I would do like Diesel says and go from 60 to 100.  The 80 Hz is a reference that should work for most speakers but if you have smaller books/sats then you might have to go higher.  This is not the case with the Chanes.    The reason that you have to play with it is sometimes is better to have the do the lows instead of the mains.  I know this was the case in my brothers setup.  The bass was better for the off center/non sweet spot positions with the sub vs the mains.  Even though the mains could output the frequencies it was still so much better having the sub do it.  YMMV but it's worth it to put on some music/movies and then play with the xover point to see what works best for you.
hometheater,3bc1n5,raeanin,1 point,Sun Jun 28 00:00:46 2015 UTC,"A crossover is not a brick wall, it's a slope down after the selected frequency, often 12db per octave for sub crossovers.   You don't want your mains playing much if any sound below their f3 (55hz for your speakers).  So assuming your XO is 12db/octave, setting it to 80 will give you -12db(little less than half volume) at 40hz(lower than you want). That's enough to still cause some nasty harmonics/distortion if you crank it up real loud.  Ideally, you would want more like 100hz for your crossover setting with those speakers. However, playing a sub too high can lead to localization, where the position of the sub becomes apparent at higher frequencies. But you will be getting cleaner low end sound at higher volumem since you aren't overworking your mains. So it ends up being a toss up on which sounds better, just have to see which sounds better in your room.  tl;dr: 80 to 100 hz would be a good XO point for your sub/speakers"

If towers are okay then I recommend a pair of Martin Logan Motion 40 speakers combined with a Goldenear Forcefield 5.  If you need smaller speakers then a pair of Martin Logan Motion 35XT speakers paired with the same sub.  The Goldenear sub is compact but very powerful so it will fit within your limited space apartment and you can control it's output (might want to invest in a bass isolator pad) but it has more than enough output to handle when you move and expand out to a full 5.1 system.

hometheater,3b8pis,biggame1717,2,Fri Jun 26 21:44:24 2015 UTC,Both subs need to be identical to run dual. Your psw10 is an entry level subwoofer and I would not recommend getting another. I would simply upgrade it-but not to the psw505.  Is your budget ~250-300 for a new sub?
hometheater,3b8pis,turbosubaru,1 point,Fri Jun 26 22:32:28 2015 UTC,"Ya, right around there.  I don't mind spending a bit more.  Ya, my whole set-up is pretty entry level.  I only spent a little more on the receiver for upgrade ease.  I have currently  x4 Polk Monitor 30 Bookshelf http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16882290200  x1 CS1 Center Channel http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16882290210  I was planning on getting  x2  Monitor 60 Floorstanding http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16882290206&cm_re=polk_monitor-_-82-290-206-_-Product  And another subwoofer.  What do you suggest?"
hometheater,3b8pis,turbosubaru,2,Fri Jun 26 23:06:45 2015 UTC,"I think those towers would be a nice addition, I'm happy to see that everything you have is timbre matched(from the same speaker line-in your case, monitor).  The subwoofer does not have to match the speakers(be from same brand) because the sound it produces is omnidirectional(you can't tell where it's coming from)  With your budget, I would suggest the outlaw m8: http://www.outlawaudio.com/products/m8.html ($299)  Don't let the size fool you-this is a true baby boomer and will hit 29hz at +/-3db. There is a tempting package deal for two as well($548)  If you would like to spend a bit more for a bigger subwoofer, I would recommend the hsu stf 2: http://www.hsuresearch.com/products/stf-2.html ($319+46 s/h)  This subwoofer can hit 25hz at +/- 2b  Deisel gave you a good article to read. I personally run 2 identical subs at the moment.  Edit: For comparison, your current subwoofer can only hit 40hz at +/- 3b. Your in for a real treat."
hometheater,3b8pis,TVodhanel,1 point,Sat Jun 27 00:33:41 2015 UTC,What do you expect to gain with the towers?  You should be setting all speakers to small/80hz (or higher) once you have a capable subwoofer or two in the system anyway. I would put that $300 into the sub budget.

hometheater,3b4kvh,BonquiquiShiquavius,9,Fri Jun 26 16:06:32 2015 UTC,"The one thing these types of charts don't take into account is - and I'm not even sure what to call it - but let's call it ""buyer knowledge"".  I'm sure there's a better term, but I can't think of one right now.    By ""buyer knowledge"" I mean, as the person buying the TV, I know what resolution it is.  I know if I bought a 720p 36"" TV, it would probably be just fine from where my couch is.  The thing is, I also know I'm going to be constantly second guessing my decision to buy the lowest resolution out there.  And every time I happen to be passing by the TV I know I'm going to notice how fuzzy everything looks.  Now if I didn't know what resolution the TV I bought was, chances are I wouldn't notice/care.  I know my wife probably won't.  But because I do know what I bought, I'm never going to be satisfied with a lower resolution if a higher one is in my price range.   Edit: I should also mention that I do realize at some point very high resolutions never make sense below a certain TV size.  But even on a 36"" TV, the difference between 720 and 1080 is definitely noticeable.  Maybe not from where the couch is, but it's there."
hometheater,3b4kvh,ImNotYourFriendBuddy,5,Thu Jun 25 23:00:12 2015 UTC,"I see what you mean. But I'm not sure how this chart, or any chart could really take that into account. You're kinda talking about a subjective psychological phenomenon. This is just a tool for buyers to know what the ranges are. Perhaps I could put a disclaimer about how you may notice the differences up close still?"
hometheater,3b4kvh,popping101,4,Thu Jun 25 23:09:03 2015 UTC,"No, I think your chart is fine as is.  And I like it a lot more than the other one you linked to.  It's just an observation on my part (and I'm betting I'm not alone in this) that whenever I use a chart like that to find my optimal resolution, it almost always suggests 720p.  And every time I'm still happy I went with 1080p instead."
hometheater,3b4kvh,thevdude,1 point,Thu Jun 25 23:13:06 2015 UTC,Whenever I use the chart I look at the recommended resolution for the size and distance then compare models with the specs I'm after. Almost always you can find the higher resolution in your price point thats going to do what you want. Like anything buyer related there is always trade offs and I like you would trade certain features for better resolution - to a point of course.
hometheater,3b4kvh,wongsta,1 point,Fri Jun 26 00:50:30 2015 UTC,"Well there's another factor or two involved there as well, besides the psychological bit.  One, is if you're close to your screen, shifting around in your seat and chairs will have a greater proportional effect. So for example, if you think you normally are three feet away from your computer screen, you may not realize that when reading small text, sometimes you get as close as one and a half feet.  The other factor is interfaces - mainly on computers. Many interfaces don't scale with screen size smartly. If the bottom bar of windows is always 60 pixels tall, it will take up much more space on 720p vs 1080p. Not to mention websites and text will be troubled this way too - making the whole experience seem worse, even if readability shouldn't be affected according to the charts.  That last factor is also a double-edged sword, because 1440 and 4K computer monitors often have trouble on websites that use pixel measurements, causing them to look zoomed out and hard to read."

hometheater,3b4kvh,dark180,1 point,Mon Jun 29 19:24:21 2015 UTC,"one thing to note is, if you downscale a video to 720p, it can look blurry/sharp depending on what algorithm you use/the TV uses.

hometheater,3b7c8m,DolphinDestroyerv2,1 point,Fri Jun 26 16:37:22 2015 UTC,"On the link to the amplifier, if you click on questions, the first question that's asked has an answer that states that    The speaker level outputs are not powered, they are pass-throughs from the source amplifier driving this amp. Only the subwoofer output is powered.   Is this true? Does this mean that it will only put out power to the single channel coming out of the back of the amp shown in the third picture? Someone else also says that only has a mono channel output.   Would I need to get an amplifier with at least 2 channels and then run the speakers in parallel, with the bass shaker in the second channel?

hometheater,3b2v3x,bradAHA,9,Thu Jun 25 14:59:03 2015 UTC,"Filmmaker/Video editor here.   As far as I can tell, this is a marketing gimmick, plain and simple - and as usual, it's going to confuse customers (think LED vs LCD tvs).   An HDR TV seems to be nothing but a TV with a high true contrast ratio, meaning the blacks are darker and whites are brighter, at the same time. This is a good thing and OLED monitors are great at it.   But there is absolutely no point in making content for specific for these screens.  When video is edited and color graded for broadcast, true black is given 0% luminance and true white is given 100% luminance. Anything above 100 and below 0 clips out, but is still fully black or white. There is no point in going beyond those numbers because there is no such thing as whiter than white and blacker than black.   So why make content that exceeds those ranges? Just adjust your contrast settings on your pretty new OLED so that on any old video, when you see black, it's black and when you see white, it's white - not dark gray and light gray.   And this doesn't even go into the fact that this label is pretty much unrelated to what we know as ""HDR video."" You can watch HDR video on any monitor because it's describing the dynamic range of the image capture not the image display."
hometheater,3b2v3x,jonjiv,3,Thu Jun 25 22:16:22 2015 UTC,"The usual marketing BS, feeding consumers misinformation and then selling them that product. We already have ""HDR"" displays (Plasma and OLED) with realistic contrast ratios. Well, I guess had. They should have marketed Plasma as HDR, eh?  The real problems are the very low bitrate for streaming video and audio, the terrible contrast ratio of LCDs (even really good VA panels), and to a far lesser extent, the limited adoption (as far as I know) of rec 2020 particularly higher bit depth and broader color gamut."
hometheater,3b2v3x,TactFully,3,Thu Jun 25 23:36:51 2015 UTC,"is absolutely no point in making content for specific for these screens.   either way,  it's finally forcing TV manufacturers to do something about the garbage contrast ratio's of LCD televisions."
hometheater,3b2v3x,imallin,4,Fri Jun 26 04:27:06 2015 UTC,"Can someone explain why HDR video compatibility would depend on the television? I'm only familiar with the photography term, in which you, in production of an image, combine different exposures of the same image in order to create an evenly exposed image.   If the same thing were happening on the video side, it would all stream and display identically well. So what is HDR video streaming?"
hometheater,3b2v3x,jeebidy,2,Thu Jun 25 15:59:50 2015 UTC,"In this case it's increasing the dynamic range of the video format, not combining images."
hometheater,3b2v3x,jonjiv,3,Thu Jun 25 16:10:37 2015 UTC,"You can't increase the dynamic range of a video format, you can only increase the number of intervals between white and black. That's why using HDR to describe this technology is misleading.   I'm not even entirely sure they're increasing the intervals with this tech. That would be an increase of the video's bit-depth. Broadcast video is currently 8-bit. It's typical for high end cameras to shoot 10-bit video. But I personally think a lot more good can be done by increasing the bit-rate, not the bit-depth. Streaming video bit-rates are inferior to the original capture format of most cameras."
hometheater,3b2v3x,TactFully,3,Thu Jun 25 22:47:01 2015 UTC,"Amen. Bit rate increases would be wonderful. We already have ""HDR"" TVs with Plasma and OLED able to show over 14 stops of dynamic range (I know, oled is theoretically infinite), which is what really good cameras can capture. Not like crappy LCDs with 10-12 stops."
hometheater,3b2v3x,xtrmbikin,4,Thu Jun 25 23:30:54 2015 UTC,Someone else can correct me but I believe it has to do with the luminance level off the TV. So say your non HDR TV is 400nit but an HDR TV is 2-3 times brighter. I welcome the increased brightness of TV's but I also fear it will shorten the lifespan of the backlight.
hometheater,3b2v3x,intaketurbine,2,Thu Jun 25 16:04:38 2015 UTC,"The main purpose contrast, not brightness: ""It all comes back to contrast ratio. That’s what the real story is. The idea of HDR is not to make an ultrabright TV—at least, not in and of itself. The idea is to make a TV with enough headroom to create truly bright highlights, while at the same time creating inky deep blacks."" http://www.soundandvision.com/content/hdr-other-oled"

hometheater,3b2v3x,imallin,1 point,Fri Jun 26 21:20:14 2015 UTC,Dell U2410. It's at least H(igher)DR than a normal monitor via dithering as long as I'm using a capable GPU and displayport.
hometheater,3b2v3x,SirMaster,1 point,Fri Jun 26 21:28:27 2015 UTC,"HDR is more about extreme contrast ratio.  IPS monitors are totally lacking in that area.  Higher color gamut is part of it, certainly,  but the main benefit to HDR is going to be being able to have a much larger range of contrast.    Wide gamut monitors like the U2410 look over-saturated in non-color managed situations, because the monitor will take a standard gamut input, and stretch it to the monitors gamut,  making images over-saturated and inaccurate.  This can only be fixed by using a colorimeter to profile the monitor.   A monitor like the U2410, might be capable of the wide color range of HDR spec,  but it cannot come remotely close to matching the dynamic range (contrast) to go along with it, and it's wide gamut abilities are not well taken advantage of in most cases,  making the image look over saturated.   A plasma display or OLED would give a better idea of what to expect from HDR,  not necessarily because of the color depth,  but because of the extreme contrast ratio's.  A typical IPS monitor does well to hit a 1000:1 contrast ratio,  a good plasma can do north of 20,000:1,  and an OLED is technically infinite."

hometheater,3b2g39,arockbiter,2,Thu Jun 25 13:30:14 2015 UTC,"I agree, and even more critically, I would ensure that for a home theater, the center channel and L/R channels are upgraded first.  I would rather have LCR (or just LR) top notch, and go 2.0 or 3.0, than spread that money around to 5.0 or 5.1 or higher.  $500 can buy some amazing quality sound if kept to 2.0 or 3.0."
hometheater,3b2g39,chemistry_teacher,2,Thu Jun 25 19:42:00 2015 UTC,I have the oppo 103 and love it but get quality speakers first. Don't buy htib I did my first set and for $100 more I could have built a much better set. The ps3 is a very good blu Ray player its what I used until I got the oppo this past month.
hometheater,3b2g39,traun,2,Thu Jun 25 15:12:09 2015 UTC,"I have this player and it is the heart of my HT. Although it's an excellent BD player (at that price it better be) I use it mainly as my network streaming device as it has excellent network support.   Another plus is if you have Cinavia infected content the Oppo will play them just fine (from a USB or network source) whereas Sony's PS3 most definitely will not. Also, there are ways to copy your Blu-Rays onto your network server and have the Oppo play this content as if you were playing the original Blu-Ray.  But if don't need any of this then definitely go with the PS3."
hometheater,3b2g39,FlaveC,1 point,Thu Jun 25 17:03:55 2015 UTC,If you think a 100 Blu Ray player is good enough then whey not use your PS3.  It is what I used on my 120 inch screen until I got my PS4.  So much of the media that is put out there isn't as good as it could be anyway so having the extra 15% of visual goodness is likely not going to be apparent most of the time.   The fact you have a HTiB means you are not that driven by super high quality or possibly even able to tell the difference (a very good thing for your wallet) so why buy the fancier wine when the $15 bottle tastes just as good.  I would say Put the $500 into something else cover the next two years of Digital movie downloads.   Put it in the savings for the next projector upgrade.

hometheater,3b2g39,bkedelen,1 point,Thu Jun 25 18:18:26 2015 UTC,"Oppo is a terrible value. Your PS3 is one of the best BD players ever. If you hate money, the higher end Panasonic BD players are excellent (the same) and cost 1/4 as much as the less expensive Oppo models. BD encodes digital audio and digital video. The Oppo cannot (cannot!) have better quality digital output than your PS3 because they both read all the 0s and all the 1s off of your optical media and then send them out the HDMI hole to your receiver."
hometheater,3b2g39,GeeBee72,3,Thu Jun 25 13:42:23 2015 UTC,"Oppo has excellent quality control and is known for excellent audio output from all media sources, they all have pretty fantastic headphone/analog output.    The big feature of Oppo players was their upscaling of DVDs to 1080p.  But the PS3 is a more than capable, continuously updated BD player.  A bit of a pain in the ass to actually start watching a movie if it doesn't autoplay or the system has multiple users set up though."
hometheater,3b2g39,bkedelen,1 point,Thu Jun 25 14:33:19 2015 UTC,"I absolutely agree.  The Oppo isn't a bad product, its an outstanding product.

hometheater,3b2g39,eatingcarbs,2,Thu Jun 25 14:06:55 2015 UTC,"I haven't researched it extensively, but I'll tell you why it doesn't surprise me that much. If you're getting the signal out by HDMI, then everything the player is doing is digital, and as long as it works right then that get the signal extremely close to the data on the disc. You aren't worrying about the players DACs or power supply noise or crosstalk or anything like that- if it just reads the disc properly and you're OK with the interface, I think you're good to go unless you need/want some sort of fine tuning tweaks. Generally though, I think most of those tweaks would happen in your receiver and screen.  I agree with other folks who say to put the money toward speakers. Having looked around a bit, I don't think that any speakers below 6"" woofers sound very good/natural for the volumes that I like. It's really the sound frequencies between ~80hz and ~200hz that I think most of the HTIB size speakers are missing. The sub can fill in below that, but that's the region of sound that gives a lot of the 'impact' in things like bass drums."

hometheater,3b4atk,e60deluxe,1 point,Fri Jun 26 05:29:02 2015 UTC,"Are you using Wi-Fi? The Wi-Fi antennae write run from the motherboard up to the screen by the hinges. The Wi-Fi will still work and those wires aren't a big deal.  The big deal is whichever wire supplied the screen with power. I would suggest you take the laptop apart and disconnect all the wires that were clipped, replace the Wi-Fi antennae (probably a couple dollars or just make your own), then put it back together. That way you won't short out the entire machine and should get better signal.  It's too late now, but I don't think decent wireless hdmi exists. Decent wireless keyboards do. I have this one https://www.amazon.com/dp/B005DKZTMG/ref=cm_sw_r_awd_uOpJvbBQ7Q2KT on hooked up to my pc in the living room.   Do fix your computer, then get the keyboard.

I imagine the sub is not too good if it's rca brand. The rti12s don't need a sub if you give them enough power to open up.  Your amp does not have enough juice for the rti12s, I wish I could suggest a behringer a500 power amp($200) but the Yamaha doesn't have pre outs for the rti12s.  This would be adequate for your system: http://www.accessories4less.com/make-a-store/item/denavr4520ci/denon-avr-4520ci-denon-s-flagship-home-theater-receiver-150wpc/1.html but even then I would want more power(150 watts 8ohms 2 ch driven)  Your yammy is actually 80watts 8ohms 2 ch driven-that's the rating u go by. & that number will decrease as more channels are driven.  Long story short-u want a reciever with pre outs(fl & fr) for the rti12s.  Example: http://www.accessories4less.com/make-a-store/item/marnr1603/marantz-nr1603-slimline-7.1-network-av-receiver-with-airplay/1.html + http://www.amazon.com/Behringer-A500-BEHRINGER-REFERENCE-AMPLIFIER/dp/B000CZ0RL0  Edit: horrible format/grammar"

Or If I could bump up to the Yamaha v577 it has 7.1 and ability (I think) to BI-amp the fronts  (I'm ok with a 5.1 system)   If I had the 9 channel dennon, is it possible to use some of those extra channels to BiAmp the 12's. All the speakers have Bi-amp capability  Also, will the Rti12s overpower the center and surrounds once they are amped? Sorry so many questions"
hometheater,3b48ti,turbosubaru,1 point,Thu Jun 25 21:55:04 2015 UTC,Well if your comfortable with 5.1 I would sell the rti8s. The rti6s will be better surrounds since they will be above ear level on stands. What your talking about is passive bi amping-some people think it's a gimmick-some think it helps.  No the reciever will not let the rti12s overpower-everything is timbre matched anyway. In 2 channel stereo u will be able to blow the house up if u feed them enough power however.  What would u do with ur current yammy? Sell it? Will best buy take it back?
hometheater,3b48ti,turbosubaru,1 point,Thu Jun 25 22:09:54 2015 UTC,Eh looks like Best buy is a 15 day return.. so I'd have to sell it.. I can prob get like 150-200.

If you get all your media from other devices then they are a good fit.  They only do up to 65"" though.  I have the 55"" above the fireplace and I have family who are loving their Seiki TV as well."

Like the other poster said, home theater projectors aren't terribly bright, and all have Eco modes to lower the lumens when watching at night/full light control. Also, a projector can work in a room with normal lighting, even some sunlight, with a black/grey light rejecting screen.  Also, it's funny that you mention overly bright / fake looking picture quality with projectors, when virtually everyTV made today(save the remaining plasmas, high end LCDs and OLEDs) comes with a horibly blown out fake looking ultra-dynamic picture, that requires significant calibration just to look decent.

To me that means similar viewing angle,  and reference level sound down to very low frequencies. Those are the things that impress me in a movie theater, so that's what I put in at home.

hometheater,3b1g5o,NeatAnecdoteBrother,3,Thu Jun 25 05:00:42 2015 UTC,"Probably your most unique requirement is dual hdmi outputs (one for projector and one for TV). This will narrow down your choices considerably. Make sure you have enough hdmi inputs for all the devices you need (plus a few more down the road). More hdmi inputs and outputs are generally more expensive.  If you're happy with 5.1 sound then you don't need to get a 7.1 receiver.  Do you have speakers yet? Receiver should match the speakers and room size. A great receiver and bad speakers won't sound good. Determine your budget for speakers and receiver and read some reviews or ask around here for tips. And if possible go to an audio store to test the setup and see how it all sounds and if you're happy with the receiver interface. Keep in mind that the room in the audio shop has sound absorption material and will sound better than your room.   Receivers have extra features these days like Spotify, wifi, AirPlay, Bluetooth etc. if these matter to you the check them out. Personally I never use them and would put my money on pure sound quality.   Good luck.   Edit: what can it do? You can use one remote (or a universal remote) to switch between your devices and control the volume. Your receiver handles this.  And it sounds much better than your TV speakers. So that's what you use it for."

Video that explains sensitivity and how much power you need.  How big is your room? How much do you want your ears to bleed?  I'd suggest a solid Yamaha or Denon personally, Like the Denon AVR X1100, or Yamaha RX-V677 ? Something like that should have more than enough power."

If one sub has much more headroom than the other you may not notice much/any improvement by adding a second.   2)different frequency response curves...especially in the deeper bass. If the two subs have different deep bass ""roll offs"" they will have different phase shifts. This will cause cancellations and you may find 2 sound worse than 1."

hometheater,3b0ong,reuscam,1 point,Thu Jun 25 16:34:39 2015 UTC,This is great information and relevant to my current situation.  I have a 20 year old Klipsch 8 inch sub and it hits plenty hard for me.  I found a matching one in good condition and am thinking about adding it to my setup.  Am I better off with two 8 inch Klipsch subs or do I move to one new BIC F12 or something in that range. Is two better than one?  What's the better path?
hometheater,3b0rkh,skalathamus,1 point,Thu Jun 25 01:20:38 2015 UTC,You can get a speaker level to line level converter.
hometheater,3b0rkh,MojoMercury,1 point,Thu Jun 25 01:43:57 2015 UTC,You should post the model number and check the manual for extra outputs.  I don't think there is a physical problem but your quality might be better if you can give the line level or speaker inputs to the sub.  You might be able to get a cool in-wall passive subwoofer with that 100W output and also use your extra powered one.
hometheater,3b0rkh,amalagg,1 point,Thu Jun 25 01:50:09 2015 UTC,"on the kenwood? it's a VR-716. Here's a photo of the sub output. no pre out on the unit. I use an RCA to speaker wire cable for the active sub already anyways, so more than anything I'm just wondering if the powered sub is still usable through that 100W output, or what will happen when I try."
hometheater,3b0rkh,amalagg,1 point,Thu Jun 25 02:09:09 2015 UTC,A lot of active subs have speaker input jacks. My opinion is that a higher impedance (an active subwoofer taking speaker level inputs) will be ok. I am not an expert but I think the receiver can handle higher impedance which. A low impedance means the device can use more power and that is a lot more dangerous (like a short circuit).  My understanding is that the active subwoofer just has the high impedance on its speaker level inputs. So adding a resistor will not help because it would only increase the impedance.
hometheater,3b0rkh,turbosubaru,1 point,Thu Jun 25 11:31:34 2015 UTC,Any reason your looking at a kenwood reciever? Seems kinda random.

hometheater,3b0rkh,turbosubaru,1 point,Thu Jun 25 03:28:03 2015 UTC,I think he's trying to help you out because passive subs are really a thing of the past (IMO?). Buying that Kenwood receiver may end up handcuffing you in the future.

hometheater,3aymuh,Readinthedark,1 point,Wed Jun 24 16:33:37 2015 UTC,Are you going to have the amp/mini system located in the house and run speaker wires out to the mounted outdoor speakers or are you going to pull the system out for every party?  Are you going to mount the speakers and have the wire hanging and just pull out the amp when you need it?    I'm wondering because that will effect what you buy.  If you're not going to mount the speakers outside then just get normal speakers and pull them out when you need them.    My other though is movie night.  If you set something up for movie night you'll want larger speakers than you currently picked out.  I've found that a lot of outdoor speakers will lack the low end of their indoor counterparts.  While music will be fine movies IMO will sound off without that lower end.  So if you think you'll be doing more movie night I would go with the indoor speakers that you pull out for the occasion vs. the outdoor ones.
hometheater,3aymuh,Armsc,1 point,Wed Jun 24 16:39:54 2015 UTC,"the idea was to have a permanent system outside.  I'll be spending 3-4 nights a week out back grilling.    One other option is to include one of these mounted on the porch, protected from the elements."
hometheater,3aymuh,Armsc,1 point,Wed Jun 24 17:11:41 2015 UTC,"If you have have a porch that can protect the amp that would be the way to go.  I see a few different options for you on this project.   Mini system and speakers - Philips Mini system $115 and BIC speakers $45 I like this combo because the mini system has it all.  BT, CD, Radio, Aux input and USB.  You have all your bases covered.  I went with the BIC's because they fit your budget and a very sensitive for the size.   Larger speakers and mini amp - OSD AP640T $120 and the Lepai 2020 $35 This setup has the benefit of the larger speakers that will play lower.  This will be better for the movies if you decide to do them.  The downside is it's pretty much either a 3.5mm or RCA input."

Some even mount leds behind the screen to provide ambient light and reduce the strain on the eyes. This should serve a similar purpose.

Your receiver has options for streaming from local music sources as well as internet sources, so you have many options for getting music.

hometheater,3az0ky,ZeosPantera,2,Wed Jun 24 19:59:54 2015 UTC,"Just my opinion, but it sounds like you would best be served by a 2.0 or 2.1 setup.  You're probably right that the Onkyo you picked up is overkill for your needs.  It has tons of video switching/scaling, audio switching/decoding/encoding stuff built in that you'll never use if you're only using one video source (laptop) every once in a while.  You probably don't even need video functionality in your receiver, since you can just connect your laptop directly to your projector whenever you need to.    If it were me, I would find a nice, well taken care of vintage stereo receiver (think Marantz/Sansui/Kenwood/Pioneer) and a pair of badass floorstanding speakers on craigslist/ebay and use that setup for all your audio.  You can use a stereo 3.5mm to stereo RCA cable from your computer headphone output to the receiver's aux input, then connect the computer video output directly to the projector.  You will still be able to hear movie dialogue fine, it will just be split evenly between the two speakers.  If you go vintage, you will have to do some research to make sure what you're buying isn't crap/broken/janky, but it will be worth it.  The added bonus to vintage receivers and speakers is that they look 1000% better than just about every modern receiver on the market and the build quality is usually better in almost all respects."

hometheater,3az0ky,amalagg,2,Thu Jun 25 05:45:28 2015 UTC,"If you have more than two people in a room you usually need a center channel to fix the dialog to one speaker and remove the cancellation effects of a separate left and right in movie mixes.   That receiver is fine, overkill is what all receivers try to display. Features you don't need and boasting power they mostly can't output. You didn't pay an arm and a leg so I'd probably stick with it. A refurbished receiver is also an option.  The big sound will come from the speakers. The chanes are the things to do it and keep your budget low. If you want to mess your budget and aesthetics a bit more the JBL Studio 530's have been my new ""end game"" speakers for a little over a month. They have a high dollar matching center that will leave just enough for the sub. A $200 Bic F12 will simply max out your higher end budget. I guarantee it works for classical, jazz, hip hop and frankly I think they are some of the most beautiful speakers out there.    As for what you need the RECEIVER is the heart of the system. A receiver is just a name for a bunch of amps with a pre-amp and digital processing. All your sources get hooked to it via HDMI.. Your projector gets hooked to it via HDMI and you wire the three speakers and sub to the receiver... That is basically it."

The unit still apears as a DLNA renderer in my network, but it does not play anything.  however, i have never had a problem with Internet radio or DLNA client, or network drop offs.   I have somewhat of an unusual setup with multiple access points and an old router as a makeshift bridge. my next project is unifi access points and hardwiring the media cabinet. i strongly suspect that is the cause of MY Airplay issues because Airplay relies on multicast and proprietary protocols, and it may not traverse my weird setup.   however, it doesnt explain my lack of DLNA renderer when it was working before, and my Sony Blu Ray does DLNA perfectly fine on the same wonky setup."

Looking at the x930c specifically, it doesn't seem to be worth the $4,000. It has the speakers on the side that are useless unless you plan on not using external speakers (and if you're dropping this much on a tv, you better have some great tower speakers with it). The speakers add some depth to the tv which take away the high end Sony tvs' greatest selling point: being stupidly thin.   The 900c is the same price, doesn't have the speakers on the side and is thus really thin, and has a semi-glossy finish that's better for a room with more lights and reflections. Beyond Sony, you can save a thousand and get the Samsung UN65JS8500  although it's not pencil thin, comes with Tizen instead of Android TV, and needs a stupid box for any HDMI inputs.  For a less ridiculous budget, the XBR65X850C is $1400 less and is still pretty much an awesome TV. The UN65JU7100 is $100 cheaper than the 850C and is pretty much the JS8500 without the SUHD stuff.  TL;DR Not worth more than a few hundred on its own. Get a JU7100 to save $1500 if you can take having Tizen on the tv and having an extra box for the HDMI input. If you don't like either of those pay $100 more for the X850C and get a slightly worse picture but get Android TV. The next step up is the JS8500 for $3000  but you get HDR and the pitfalls of the 7100. If you wanna pay the full $4k, get the 900c so you can enjoy the thinness. Getting the speakers on the 930c is stupid because you should really have better speakers with such an expensive tv."

It will support HDR via patch once the standard gets a bit more settled.  HDR is pretty much meaningless right now since there is no content. This will start to change around the end of the year when we see the first ultra hi-def blurays. They will have HDR support baked in."

hometheater,3awtlc,nightfox541,9,Wed Jun 24 03:26:32 2015 UTC,I feel like some audiophiles are going to disagree with me here but if it's for a frat and all you want to do is bump loud and throw ragers then get a pair of JBL Eon 615 or something similar. You'll also want a cheap mixer so you have some versatility and so you can designate Pledge DJ to turn knobs all night like they're actually doing something. Those speakers are self powered and loud as hell and their cabinets can take a beating. I would also suggest some speakers stands to prevent people from setting cups down on them. And don't forget the speaker cables and phone/ipod adapter

hometheater,3awtlc,pattyhax,2,Wed Jun 24 04:11:11 2015 UTC,They're considered full range so no sub needed although you could add one depending on what mixer you got. I owned a similar pair and the bass was great but you could always go to a Guitar Center or something because they'll have something along these lines you can listen to. These are PA speakers though and built mainly for live performances for bands and DJs so depending on your space it might be overkill.

Able to be powered by any amp at all, will play to club level volume without breaking a sweat, and in the La Scalas case, no cones or domes to be pushed in or damaged. People can dance on them, hard to steal, great resale value. And did I mention they will blow the doors off the place if you want.  I like your pro audio idea as well, I'd look at some powered pro audio 12 or 15 inch speakers, something with a soft dome tweeter and rca line level inputs if your budget can swing it.

I do see the light spots and shadows from the bends and dents if I have the kitchen light (coming from the left side of the screen) or roof light on while using the projector but they quickly blend away if I don't purposely try to look for them.

hometheater,3awfpu,ProbablyProne,1 point,Wed Jun 24 05:06:43 2015 UTC,"A high quality set of speakers can last a lifetime.  I would go as far as buying the w1070 and painting a wall, then dumping the rest into nice speakers.  the next $350 saved can buy a screen, but you still get enjoyment from the room in the meantime.  And when you upgrade your video components in 2 years for 4k support you can spend the money then.  remember that this is the spin up of 4k, so i wouldnt spend much at all on 1080.  speaker technology doesnt change that much, so it ends up being a much wiser investment when you actually have a chunk of cash ready to be put down."
hometheater,3awfpu,thehaguys,2,Wed Jun 24 05:12:02 2015 UTC,"I'm not convinced 4k will be mainstream enough to have a decent $3000 projector in 2 years.  I'd be seriously considering the Epson 5030 or Sony VPL-HW40 with that budget.  The Benq gives you a taste of the good stuff, but it's missing some brightness and contrast you would expect with that sort of home theater budget.  It has 3D, but the lack of brightness really detracts from the experience.  It has lens shift, but not much.   Putting up a proper screen can also make a big difference for some people.  There's no paint job that can compete with a great screen.  You'll also have spent time and money painting, when you're going to want the real thing soon."
hometheater,3awfpu,arockbiter,1 point,Wed Jun 24 06:25:47 2015 UTC,"I agree with all of that.  But I firmly maintain that you should go speakers first.  And that budget might not actually be enough to go full 5.1 - a mid-level set of Paradigms (Studio 60, CC590, ADP590) will run you $5,595 MSRP.  And that doesn't touch amps/pre-amps/HTRs or subwoofers.  But in the end I guess it depends on where you apply the value - if you care more about picture quality, then spend the money on the video, if you are more about the audio quality, then spend the money on the speakers.  But you can conceivably have the same set of speakers 15/20 years from now while your video devices go by the wayside much quicker."

Rather, it is a dump for people asking about what the absolute cheapest hardware they should buy on an extremely limited budget.  Tired of hearing about $250 receivers, $100 speakers, and sub $1k projectors.  I wish this sub would be more inline with the experience of going to a home theater store where you discuss quality (and yes, higher priced) gear and not amazon.com's weekly special on some low tier speaker.  Why not have a FAQ made that they can click to on the right hand side of the page ""Recommend gear for low budget HT""?  And ban all the posts asking for a home theater setup with a budget of less than $10k.  I would be a thousand times more interested in hearing recommendations on a $30k setup than all of the same reposts of ""I have $500, what HT componetns should I buy?"" put together!"

There pretty much is that over at /r/zeos.  It's in the sidebar:   If you are looking for a Buying Guide user /u/ZeosPantera created a subreddit called /r/zeos with the intention to help new-comers understand what is involved in setting up simple starter stereo or surround based system and explain how to transition from stereo into a 5.1 and to keep me from having to repost the same explanations at ad-nauseum. Check there first and then come back with any specific questions about your particular setup/situation or purchasing advice."
hometheater,3auc2n,Bondidude,1 point,Wed Jun 24 14:42:41 2015 UTC,I think this is great for those low budget users.  But this sub actively needs to delete the constant stream of low budget posts that ultimately crowd out true hometheater topics.

hometheater,3auc2n,Bondidude,1 point,Wed Jun 24 16:05:02 2015 UTC,"The reason the sub may be so small is that the overall quality of the posts are very low.  If 1/3rd the posts were not, ""what system do you recommend for $1,000"" then the readership and involvement may increase and actually have more people come to the forum.  It is tiring to see the same exact question posted over and over again.  So users catch onto that fairly quickly and leave.  For example, I'm a big audiophile fan.  So when I first joined reddit, one of the first subs I went to was /r/audiophile.  After about a month, I couldn't take it and left.  There are hardly any ""audiophile"" posts in there.

You can always prop a screen on an entertainment center or something and build the projector into a bookcase or something.  Since you're limited in construction you can do, a TV would be the easier option.  Also, since you're going to be in a room with windows, unless you want to get dark or eclipse curtains, your only good viewing will be at night.  I have a projector with a 120 inch screen and I swear by it.  You might want to consider holding off on a projector setup until you have enough space and freedom to accommodate it.  As for wireless speaker systems, I don't know what your range is but quality is pricey."

There aren't many good wireless options, but the reviews on this model should tell you a lot.

You can pretty much forget game consoles and instead will need a PC with some serious horse power to get decent frames without lowering the settings too much.  If you're just going to play console games a 1080p set is still the way to go, especially since not all games are even this resolution (many are still lower and only scaled up). For normal PC usage however, a 4K set might be really interesting, however it's far too taxing for gaming unless you have serious dough to spend."
hometheater,3auop5,ma1746,1 point,Tue Jun 23 21:06:27 2015 UTC,Ok you make a good point. I was thinking that 4k would be nice down the road when more content is avalible (movies & TV).

hometheater,3auop5,Dopplegangr1,1 point,Tue Jun 23 22:25:19 2015 UTC,"For the record i did a ton of research on the TV purchase i just made. I read all the ""4k wont matter unless you watch 4k stuff"" and ""upscaling sucks"" nonsense. I bought an m65-C3 4k (vizio) and i am absolutely blown away by the quality of the 4k AND upscaled 1080p stuff. Regular hdtv fios content looks better than on the samsung 1080 led it replaced, blu rays look significantly better, closer to 4k than 1080p in my opinion. And games do look significantly better also IMO (ps4 running mlb 15 the show) You just have to really see it in person to actually appreciate what good 4k upscaling looks like.

If you mean what speakers to use them with pretty much anything as surround speakers are not overly dependent on matching.

hometheater,3av6if,Zergom,1 point,Wed Jun 24 20:48:57 2015 UTC,Whether or not 7.1 works out or not is more dependent on your room. Typically 7.1 needs a pretty sizable room to show any major improvement over a well setup 5.1 system.

I just don't know if those are so fringe still that it's worth buying into yet. My current TV doesn't support HDR but I imagine my next 4k will and I'm setting up a new room so I've thought about putting 2 monoprice ceiling speakers in for Atmos.

hometheater,3auk7t,000Destruct0,1 point,Tue Jun 23 17:12:27 2015 UTC,Just got a Samsung Un55F7050 not to long ago so I don't imagine replacing it for 4k until the content catches up for it (blu-ray etc.) so likely 2 years out or so (unless I get itchy for a new one).  I've seen Denon before and know of their quality but for $600 is the 838 worth it?
hometheater,3auk7t,amalagg,2,Tue Jun 23 17:16:51 2015 UTC,"Onkyo has it's fans but they have also had too many reliability issues lately and I have lost faith in them. I keep watching them though and if it changes they do offer a lot at each price point (which may point to their reliability woes as they cut corners to add features.)  My primary reason, even if there were no reliability issues, is that the homebrew automatic room calibration Onkyo uses is garbage.

hometheater,3atu6g,tomhughes86,3,Tue Jun 23 13:37:13 2015 UTC,"Prewiring during construction will save you tons of time and effort in the long run.  I ran wire in my living room (1951 house) and it was a pain, so doing it beforehand will always be simpler.  I would suggest going beyond this and wiring for 7.1 surround (2 fronts, 2 sides, 2 rears, 1 center, 1 sub).  You can leave the wiring there if you don't on using it now, but it'll be nice to have ahead of time.  Also consider if a future AV receiver will be capable of multiple sets of speakers, meaning that you could pipe music out to a patio or another room in the house.  Laying down this wiring now would again save you sweat and tears later.  I think going with the separate closest is a good idea.  It might be worthwhile having a small AC duct setup in there since a lot of this type of equipment can get hot, especially if you add more to the setup later on.  Also, there are plenty of RF based remote controls or IR blasters that can get around the issue of line of sight to the closet interior.  You'll also want to have your HDMI, SPDIF/TOSLINK/Optical, and any other cables you will have connected to the TV also routed to closet.  Monoprice makes good quality CL2 (in-wall rated) wiring that include net jackets (help protect the cable while inside the wall) for good prices.  I found it easiest to literally lay out all the things that were required to watch TV/play PS4/etc. on the floor just to ensure there were no wires I was forgetting.  Also, don't forget a power outlet at the mounted TV's height.  For the other wires (audio, HDMI, etc.) you can place conduits in the wall with open ended junction boxes that allow you to potentially add/remove the cables in the future.  This helps with ease of use, plus they can be sealed so that you don't have to worry about openings for energy efficiency of your AC.  There are tons of ways to make this work, so you'll have to make it best suited for your environment.  The main takeaway for me when I did it was just to ensure that every future potentiality I could think of was accounted for."

You are going to have an angle your head up at a pretty awkward angle to even see the picture and most TV's dont have very good vertical offset viewing angles."
hometheater,3atu6g,scott_fx,2,Tue Jun 23 15:36:26 2015 UTC,"Ya, I'm not thrilled about above the fireplace either, but I have been looking at mounts to adjust viewing angle with that in mind"
hometheater,3atu6g,Meganormous,1 point,Tue Jun 23 16:25:20 2015 UTC,"There are only a couple mounts that can do this. I had to mount mine above the fireplace for the WAF. I used a mantlemount and so far love it. Here are some images of it installed.   Do you want the TV plugged into the same power conditioner/outlet strip as the rest of the av equipment? If so, you need wire that runs from the TV (regular wall outlet - female) to the closet. There you can put in a male wall outlet and use a short extension cord to plug into the outlet strip. DO NOT let the builder only give you the option of running an extension cord in the wall. This is WRONG and should be avoided.   As others have said, try to think about what you could want in the future (7.1, atmos, multi-room, multi sub, etc.). That way you just wire it once. Definitely run at least 2 cat6 cables to the TV so if the HDMI breaks, you can use converters to get signal there. Conduit is ideal if you can swing it, but it gets pricey. Don't forget an IR repeater either. That way you just point the remote at the TV and it takes over.   I would say run cat6 everywhere inside the house. I mean everywhere. You can never have too much. Same for speaker wire. Just be sure to get in wall rated (CL2 I believe) to be safe.   Make sure your builder is cool with you running the wire yourself if you are planning that."

We were probably 10-11 ft from the screen with the bottom of the screen being roughly 6 ft from the ground.  It was a 60"".  I wasn't trying to be rude with my comment. It was kind of a jab though.  My apologies.    I think a lot of the over the fireplace mount depends on sitting position.  If you are far away, I don't think it'll be that bad. Like 15'.

hometheater,3atu6g,germanplumber,2,Tue Jun 23 22:55:57 2015 UTC,"Run 2 long HDMI cables, and 2 cat 6 cables from fireplace to closet so that way you are future proofed. Prewire for what you think you might you want for the future. Run speaker wire to all locations and run extra wires for 7.1 just in case since its cheap and not much extra work while you don't have drywall up.  I typically recommend against the fireplace just because of the height but if thats what you want then do it to it.  Have power and coax ran behind fireplace. Have coax ran to closet.  You you can have a tube installed from closet to fireplace with a pull cable for future runs."

hometheater,3augte,chitown_illini,1 point,Tue Jun 23 17:09:57 2015 UTC,"I had a 110"" AT screen built for my theater.  My main take aways:   Make sure you plan for access to the area behind the screen (door, removable panel, etc.). You mentioned 12' width, but you didn't mention length.  Make sure your main listening position is not in the exact middle lengthwise (including area behind screen), as there will likely be a bass null at that point.  Acoustic treatments will vary based upon the room.  But, I've got bass traps in each corner of the true front-wall behind the AT screen.  A bigger issue will likely be making sure you treat the first reflection points between the AT screen and your main listening position. The only other issue you may run into is fitting the 135"" screen in a 12' wide room.  My 110"" is in an 11' wide room and there is very little room on sides due to the screen border:  https://imgur.com/a/w7Faa"

hometheater,3augte,chitown_illini,1 point,Tue Jun 23 17:19:25 2015 UTC,"You should be able to make it work.  If you use 2x4s in a standard box pattern to frame it out, the lumber itself will take up 4"" on each side; leaving you with ~7"" between.

They and Marantz are now owned by D&M holdings.   I'll try and be clear but who knows! If you go strictly by how the amp sounds without all the pre-amp add-ons they are all more or less the same within price points. Where Denon has it's major advantage (aside from reliability) is it's use of Audyssey auto room calibration which is much better than whatever that crap is Onkyo now uses.  As for the two receivers in question the 3100 has a bit more power and more audyssey features. Where this me I'd pay the extra but I'll leave that up to you. Both are good units."

I obviously don't have that capability right now, but eventually I figure I'll upgrade and it would be nice for that functionality to already be in place so I don't have to upgrade receivers too.

hometheater,3ar7n7,citycat23,5,Tue Jun 23 01:01:19 2015 UTC,Personally I'd get one of the biggest he can afford and then add a second one down the road instead of two OK ones you'll be stuck with for a while.
hometheater,3ar7n7,niuguy,1 point,Tue Jun 23 05:28:54 2015 UTC,"Yep, if there's any chance of upgrading in the future, get the best subwoofer you can afford right now. It'll make your upgrade path easier and cheaper: get a second identical one down the road. If you get 2 lesser ones now, you'll be forced to buy 1 or 2 better subwoofers anyway if you want to upgrade.  Additionally, 2 subwoofers 'can' help with smoothing out frequency response, but without careful placement, it can actually diminish sound quality - it's far from a given.   From http://www.soundandvision.com/content/tom-vodhanel-president-power-sound-audio  S&V: Would you recommend S&V readers buy four smaller subs, two midsized subs, or one large sub, if the price for the different packages were about the same?   TV: I usually stick with one. First, customers need to realize that the potential benefits with multiple subs are just that: potential. The benefit is usually realized as more even coverage. Often to realize the full benefits of multiple subwoofers, especially with two, you have to experiment with placement, and they may not have room or their wife won’t allow it. A lot depends on room dimensions and where the sitting positions are. To get the full benefits of multiple subs they have to have flexibility in placement. Some people think with two subwoofers it’s going to be exponentially better, but that’s often not the case."

hometheater,3ar7n7,turbosubaru,1 point,Tue Jun 23 12:14:14 2015 UTC,"Since Martin Logan's speakers are 4 ohm I would recommend investing in a separates solution rather than a receiver. I have Martin Logan in my setup as well...I've heard how shrill and lifeless they can sound setup in a store system with a mid-range receiver vs how open and dynamic they sound in my setup. Power and quality amplification makes a huge difference. Try Emotiva. Their XPA-5 power amp + a receiver with pre-outs make a very nice combo that will run circles around any receiver by itself.  Personally, I like Marantz receivers. They will more than meet your needs for the time being if you want to use the built-in amps and get the Emotiva power amp later on. If you want to get 7.1 instead of 5.1, you can run the fronts, center and main surrounds on the power amp then run the back surrounds on the receiver.  I started with a Yamaha receiver and once I added some power amps to the mix, I could never go back to just using a receiver...it made a night and day difference for me."

hometheater,3ar0m4,turbosubaru,2,Mon Jun 22 22:30:32 2015 UTC,"First off I would reconsider the PSW10 in favor of a Dayton, or Yamaha sub for the same money.  I've just heard of very mixed reviews on the PSW10.    Second I think the MB42 would be fine for surrounds.  If they are that cheap pick them up.  You'll need some speaker wire (how much/length depends on room size and how you're going to route it), some cables (HDMI and optical #'s depending on your sources) and maybe some stands for you speakers.  How many cables is figured out by how many HDMI sources you have +1 for the monitor to the TV from the AVR.  If you're running from the TV to the AVR then you'll want an optical or if the source you have doesn't have HDMI you'll want to try to use and optical also.  If the sub has one RCA input then you're good to go without the ""Y"" cable.  I've found that even though the sub is mono the Dayton's respond better to having both right and left inputs filled.  In that case I always recommend a ""Y"" sub cable as they just seem to make the sub work better."

hometheater,3aphj4,cajunflavoredbob,2,Tue Jun 23 02:02:19 2015 UTC,"Oh this is a famous issue with Onkyos. They're great receivers, but every now and then...  First off, I suggest that you factor reset the unit. This will tell you right away if the problem is hardware or software. To factory reset an Onkyo 609 receiver, you hold the VCR/DVR button on the front, and then press power. This is done while the unit is already powered on. You should see a message that says ""CLEAR!"" on the display. You can release the buttons. It should take about 5 seconds or so, and it will power itself off. Turn it back on, and run through the initial setup on screen. Put it on any active input and see if HDMI is working now.  If HDMI is still not working, then it is unlikely that a firmware update will solve anything."

Most repair centers are going to ask for a deposit on any out of warranty repair. So you normally put down $80 or so that they get to keep no matter how much the repair costs. If it costs over the deposit amount, then you pay the remaining balance. They will usually call and let you know what the repair estimate will be before they start the work, but you lose the deposit no matter what happens. Check on Onkyo's website for a repair center, and call them. They'll give you their best suggestion on what to do based on what you tell them is going on."

hometheater,3aox6n,Hotrodder00,11,Mon Jun 22 08:42:29 2015 UTC,"The coax outlets are for sending component video to the projector. This is how it was done on older equipment. Component video needs 3 wires for sending HD video, so this setup was using 2 component video runs.   The middle plate is either a standard coax outlet for cable service, which is odd that it is at the projector, or it is a composite video line for older devices like DVD players or a Wii.   The RJ45 jack (ethernet) could be the thing that saves your bacon. You have to figure out where that line is running. If it is going back to a media cabinet or something, then you can send HDMI video over it with a balun. To get it over a single category line is not cheap, but it is cheaper than starting from scratch. You'll need an HDbaseT HDMI balun that operates on a single category line.   Good luck!  EDIT: Someone else mentioned that they could be for sending uncompressed 5.1 audio. This is certainly possible, but if it is on the ceiling, it was most likely for a projector, and projectors don't send or receive audio. Well, some do, but you shouldn't be relying on a 5W speaker on a projector if a home theater is your goal. Coaxial wire was pretty versatile when we were still using it to rough in houses, and it can certainly send either video or audio. In the case of a projector, however, it is more likely to have used it for 2 component video sources."

hometheater,3aox6n,Toysoldier34,3,Mon Jun 22 10:59:00 2015 UTC,"Before HDMI, you could use 6 coax wires to send uncompressed 5.1 from a blueray to receiver.  This possibly is for this + 1 visual.  I can't imagine why they'd run that to a projector unless someone was very very confused.    I'd suggest you get a signal detector to determine which wire goes where."

I've seen 5 coax used frequently to transmit VGA signal in higher education and commercial AV installations. Usually it's BNC connectors, not F-type (screw connectors) though. Like this: http://www.blackbox.com/Store/Detail.aspx/VGA-RGBHV-Cable-1-HD15-Male-5-BNC-PVC-10-ft-3-0-m/EYRGBS4%C4%820010"

And very weird that if it's for a projector the connections would be where the screen goes rather than in the middle of the ceiling close to where the projector would go. Can you ask the contractor? Maybe it's best that you don't know."
hometheater,3aox6n,Space_Guppy,0,Mon Jun 22 20:00:46 2015 UTC,"Hmm that is really odd, I was running through my head some scenarios but nothing made much sense.

hometheater,3apkf1,pcdude99,1 point,Mon Jun 22 14:24:01 2015 UTC,Cablebox (FiOS) which has DVR built in.  No blueray or other devices.

hometheater,3arewf,yahheridesabike,3,Mon Jun 22 22:13:13 2015 UTC,"For ""loud"" speakers we look at sensitivity, not max power handling... and klipsch are notorious for high sensitivity. Which means loud. Very loud."
hometheater,3arewf,starkiller10123,1 point,Mon Jun 22 22:23:31 2015 UTC,Interesting! Thats good to know. Thanks. So what exactly is power handling for then?
hometheater,3arewf,starkiller10123,1 point,Mon Jun 22 22:27:12 2015 UTC,How much power they can handle. More power doesn't necessarily mean louder.
hometheater,3arewf,000Destruct0,1 point,Mon Jun 22 22:34:37 2015 UTC,"One thing I will add... if you have heard Klipsch speakers and like the sound that sounds like a reasonable deal. If you haven't heard Klipsch speakers I strongly recommend you listen to some before you buy, they are bright to the point of being harsh to some while others love them. Polarizing sound so listen before purchasing."
hometheater,3apyiv,htqs99992,4,Mon Jun 22 15:41:48 2015 UTC,Theoretically they can. When you relieve the receivers amp from dealing with the lower several octaves of sound reproduction (which is where the biggest power draw is at) it allows the amp to then work much easier and leaves considerably more power on tap for transients.  Whether your ears are sensitive enough to hear the difference is a different story altogether and will depend a lot also on how much low frequency sound is in what you listen to and how loud you like to listen.
hometheater,3apyiv,000Destruct0,1 point,Mon Jun 22 15:55:54 2015 UTC,"Thanks a lot. I'm happy with the speakers, I suppose I'm hoping the subs will ""fill out"" the sound sufficiently!"
hometheater,3apyiv,guess_twat,2,Mon Jun 22 15:56:51 2015 UTC,As someone who has been in the lifestyle a long time I will say that a good sub is hard not to beat.
hometheater,3apyiv,pcdude99,1 point,Mon Jun 22 21:39:05 2015 UTC,"In theory, the mids might sound better, especially at higher listening levels as cone excursion in the main speakers is minimized due to the high pass filtering of the crossover.  At lower listening levels, this effect should be minimized.  High frequencies would see no benefit since the tweeters are low pass filtered in the speakers themselves."
hometheater,3apyiv,Armsc,1 point,Mon Jun 22 16:09:45 2015 UTC,I have found that a sub/AVR combo helps to make the mains sound better by removing the lower bass that many smaller drivers struggle to get to.  This allows them to focus on the mids and highs where they preform best.  So short answer is yes a sub can help the other speakers in your system sound better.  Especially if you like bass heavy music.
hometheater,3apyiv,ghebert001,-2,Mon Jun 22 22:03:03 2015 UTC,"With a sensitivity rating of 86 dB I hope you have a good amp to drive those otherwise you'll likely hear bass only out of the sub and not much out of the speakers.  You should set your crossover as low as possible to let your speakers handle as much of the bass as it can. The smaller woofers in a speaker will handle bass more accurately than a sub will but the speakers need some real power to actually produce bass and have a good blend between the sub and speakers. Let's say you set your crossover to 80 Hz as most do, you don't want loud thundering bass up to 80 Hz and then when the signal is crossed over to your speakers for above 80 Hz bass it may sound underwhelming if your amp isn't powerful enough."
hometheater,3apyiv,000Destruct0,3,Mon Jun 22 17:57:40 2015 UTC,PSA... most powered subwoofers have a level control to keep it from overpowering the speakers.

You would be better off doing overhead, recessed ceiling speakers for your rears. Even that wouldn't be ideal, but it would be a whole lot better than placing the rears in the dining room or right next to your head in the corners.  Don't put them in the dining room, unless you're dedicating them to a second zone. 3 and 2 are out unless this is your goal.  1 and 5 get things in the corners, but it's going to be missing sound from the opposite side of the room depending on which side you sit.   4 and 6 get it centered to the chair, but you've skewed the listening space into a curve from the front speakers to the rear, so it's going to sound odd there too.   You don't really have ideal placement in this room, so unless you want to recess some ceiling speakers, just pick your poison or do without the rear speakers.

hometheater,3aobn2,TheeScientist,2,Mon Jun 22 08:05:46 2015 UTC,"Placement depends a lot on you. You need to figure out which screen you will buy and which projector. The instructions with the projector should tell you the throw distance. The throw distance is the range where the projector can hit a certain diagonal measurement on the wall. So if you wanted a 100 inch screen on the wall, you projector might tell you that it needs to be placed 12-15 feet away.   The other thing most people don't realize with projectors is that the best thing to do to have as little to tweak as possible is to get the projector to be level to the top of your screen. This means letting it hang down off the ceiling for some people, which they don't like, but it saves you from having to deal with adjusting keystone and such, so you end up with a nicer, less modified image.  As far as equipment placement, that's up to you. You can place your equipment anywhere you want as long as you can run wires to it. If you are using an A/V receiver for input switching, then you will only need to run a single HDMI cable to the projector. I would suggest running a pair of CAT6 wires to the projector with the HDMI for future proofing. If you are not using an A/V receiver, then you will need to run enough HDMI cables to support your sources. I would also suggest a small 24-4 wire for control later, although you could use one of the category wires instead.  Wherever you place your equipment, you'll need to get speaker wire from that point to the spot where each speaker is going. Save yourself some hassle, and get wire that has some indication of positive and negative on the wire. The cheap Radio Shack golden lamp cord stuff is going to make you hate life when you try to sort out which one is which later on.  If you're using a motorized projector, you will likely have a 12v trigger that needs to be run to the projector so that it will drop when the projector comes on. Some projectors always have the 12v trigger active, and some need to be enabled in the projector settings menu.  Hope this helps!  EDIT: Forgot to mention that the screen you buy depends on the room. If it is a super dark room with no windows, or the windows are blacked out, then go with a white screen. If there's some light creeping in or you find that there's a fair bit of ambient lighting during the normal operation, then use a silver/gray screen. If it's going in a room like a main living room, where the lights are on a lot, or there are some windows that can't block out all the light, then use a black screen."

Manufacturers have apologized and backpedaled when these bullshit implementations pop up, but the industry trend of whoring out your hardware/software to advertisers to get an extra $80,000 is becoming epidemic. There's no telling what ""features"" your SmartTV will automatically include in the future. So it's best to avoid them and buy a TV incapable of supporting them."

hometheater,3ap06l,LowViz,2,Mon Jun 22 12:17:34 2015 UTC,Surely this would cut down the cost    It would not.  Maintaining a separate product would cost the company more.  Especially for a model such as you speak of which would be far less popular for the masses.  The smart features are software and have already been developed.  It costs nothing to load them into the TV.  Integrated CPUs that run the smart features cost a couple dollars in bulk as do the boards with multiple inputs.

First off, you need a cable box that outputs HDMI in order to run through the Xbox. Without that, it won't work.  As for the soundbar, you didn't say how you have it hooked up. Most soundbars have at least one digital and one analogue input. Use either one that your television supports. Most televisions have a headphone jack, and this can be used for analogue audio.  Most modern televisions have a DAC built in. It isn't the best solution out there, but it is there. So running your inputs through the television first, and then down to the soundbar would probably be best in your case.  You also need to go into the settings of your television and set your sound to fixed audio, so that the television does not raise and lower the volume. Control the volume through the soundbar."

hometheater,3apgmg,Sryzon,1 point,Mon Jun 22 15:20:50 2015 UTC,"Any cable box you purchase is going to require a cable access card.

Your best option is going to run cable directly into the television and then run sound out from the television to the sound bar. In this case, you are limited by the offering if your provider. You do have the option of satellite cable, though."
hometheater,3apgmg,cajunflavoredbob,2,Mon Jun 22 15:35:16 2015 UTC,"If his cable is going straight to his TV, he just needs an external clear QAM tuner, no?

hometheater,3apgmg,cajunflavoredbob,1 point,Tue Jun 23 00:56:52 2015 UTC,This is correct. I had to contact the maker of the box and ask for a firmware upgrade that allows the box to act as a QAM tuner. They don't put it out in the open as they know people will update when they really want OTA and it's easier to deal with the few requests they get for QAM compatability. I'm updating the post in case someone else searches this issue so they can find the solution.

Of course mine doesn't have that button, and I haven't seen anything called ""input mode"" in the menus, so I'll have to find a manual online or something and see if it's still a common feature.

But for now I'll assume you will be in the mid to upper price range and quality level.   I continue to be more and more impressed by the Samsung ju7100. Without getting into some serious bucks, it is by far the best performing LED on the market. It's basically at the top of the middle class.    It has a top 3 rating in input lag and a top 5 rating in motion blur, meaning that it would be a great gaming tv, as well as for sporting events.   It's contrast ratio is 3141:1 meaning that the blacks will be superb and the whites will be near pure.    It's black uniformity has a standard deviation of 1.589% which is well above average.   It's 1080p to 4K upscaling surpasses any comparable competition so you can rest assured that your basic programming will be well above its normal performance.    Unfortunately though it has a very narrow viewing angle of just 19°. So if you plan on sitting at the sides of the tv then it may not be a great option. However this is not an issue if most of the viewing will be nearly perpendicular to the panel.   Also it has the one connect mini box that some consider cluttery  and a hassle. It basically is a box that connects to the tv that will hold all of the inputs.   Overall, the 7100 is one of the best performing tv's on the market that is very well rounded. I highly recommend it.   Edit: however this tv doesn't have good speakers, as most don't. And it is a smart tv, as most are."

I find that if I turn the TV on first that it will usually start sending the correct signal.  As far as I know, there isn't a way around this.

That should be as close to in line with the left and right channels as you can get it.  Overall, I like what you've done with the room, and it looks fun, but for a dedicated theater room, I think there are some glaring mistakes that could be fixed up yet.  bring your seating forward to allow for better 7 channel surround location, bring up your center channel to right under the screen, and consider getting a projector and screen (even a $40 DIY screen from Carl's place is pretty dang decent).

hometheater,3ajej7,cajunflavoredbob,9,Sun Jun 21 15:00:19 2015 UTC,"Looks good but if it were me, I would change a couple things   Move the Tv down the wall some, optimal viewing should be near eye level while seating.  This helps with strain on the neck.  This would also have an added bonus putting it between the left and Right speaker and closer to the center.    I like the effect of the red lighting but I would find a way to make it a indirect light.  Maybe add taller trim in front of it and if you can turn the lights to face upward to wash the wall with the light.  Maybe do a crown molding but gapped away from ceiling and add the lighting in there so it washes up the ceiling."
hometheater,3ajej7,cajunflavoredbob,3,Sat Jun 20 21:44:05 2015 UTC,"Good tips, thank you for the feedback"
hometheater,3ajej7,Minus-Celsius,0,Sat Jun 20 23:15:47 2015 UTC,Almost exactly the feedback I was going to leave.
hometheater,3ajej7,cajunflavoredbob,8,Sun Jun 21 03:06:58 2015 UTC,"I've got a few suggestions for you for the future. First off, the paint color and trim are perfect for that room. The chairs also look pretty great. My preference would be lounge seating, like sofas, but the classic theater seating is always a beautiful touch.   The posters are cool looking, but you are reflecting a lot of sound around in that room, so you might want to consider sound treatments. There are sound panels that can be placed behind posters and artwork, which would help tremendously with reverb.  Next up is the lighting. The red trim lights look really cool, but during a movie, if you leave them on, the will be shining right in your eyes and distracting you from the picture. I would suggest adding a small bit of trim to angle them up and down, and block of the light coming directly from the lights. You should only be seeing the light against the wall, never directly from the light source.  I'll just say this one directly: the television is too high on the wall. You should strive for eye level to the center of the screen. Based on your pictures, I would move that television down to maybe 6 inches above the center speaker. Try to center it vertically to the left and right channel speakers. This keeps you from getting fatigued during any long movie from strain on your neck. It's all about comfort!  Get a universal remote! I do a lot of setups with URC, but those aren't in everyone's budget or need. Logitech makes their Harmony Ultimate remotes, which would get things done for you EASILY. The setup will take you maybe 30 minutes and save your marriage! No more remembering inputs or power on options and commands.  The Onkyo HT series receivers aren't the best around. I would suggest this as your first upgrade. Grab an Onkyo TX-NR636. The 646 is the new model, but the 636 can be found on sale regularly right now. It offers a much cleaner boost to your sound output. This means you can crank the volume more without distortion. You also have the ability to add wiring later for Dolby Atmos with the 636/646 receiver.   As others have said, the best thing you can do in their is get yourself a projector and screen. The screen should be a nice white color, which should be able to handle the ambient lighting from your red accent lights. If you find that the red ambient lighting is a bit too bright for a pure white screen, you could grab a silver/gray screen instead to help with the reflections. You room is too dark for a black screen, though.  Anyway, these are my thoughts on it. You are off to a great start, and most people never even make it this far, so kudos! Remember that the first thing you should do is move that screen down to a more comfortable viewing height. Everything else is secondary. It's all about comfort!  Good luck to you!  EDIT: I forgot to mention that you should ditch the built in ""apps"" on the television and grab a Roku 3 or something. If you're an Apple user, get an Apple TV. All the same stuff as the television offers, but none of the hassle or lag."
hometheater,3ajej7,jrussell90,1 point,Sun Jun 21 03:23:06 2015 UTC,Thank you very much for taking the time to post all this. Would you be ok if I PMed you a few questions related to receivers?
hometheater,3ajej7,RapistNextDoor,3,Sun Jun 21 12:33:12 2015 UTC,"You really seem like the DIY type, so I'm not sure why you went with a prepackaged (Home Theater in a Box - HTIB) soundsystem. You can really get better results for a lower price if you're willing to do research into the component parts.  First up is a physics lesson: Sound is air pressure waves traveling through the air. To reproduce a sound at any volume, you'll need to move a certain amount of air. Speakers do this by moving a driver forward and backward with a magnet. Lower frequency (bass) sounds are tougher to reproduce because the drivers don't get to move as fast. A 2"" driver that can cleanly reproduce at 4000 Hz tone (driver moves back and forth 4000 times per second) is just not going to be able to move enough air to hear and audible 100 Hz tone (driver only moves back and forth 100 times per second). The 2"" driver will either hit its excursion limit (that's the physical limit of the magnet, the driver can only move so far forward and backward) or it rolls that sound off and doesn't try to play it.  Bigger isn't always better, but there are certain limits. To get deeper bass (anything below 120 Hz) you'll need ""large"" driver mains or a subwoofer. Bigger and better subs (size isn't everything) will get you lower bass. Again it depends on the volume you're listening to, but my first upgrade would be upgrading to a better subwoofer.  Now we get into the real problem with HTIB systems, is they are NOT upgrade friendly. Each of the component pieces is... not great. I mean, for the price, and if you really, really need a 7.1 setup at a dirt cheap price, then you'll have to make a lot of sacrifices. So maybe they do that ok. But they're really not upgrade friendly. You'll have to do your homework about what component pieces that the HTIB system will let you upgrade without causing other problems."

If you search Onkyo in this sub, a large amount of posts are with HDMI board issues, support issues, etc. Look into Denon (X series) or Marantz (SR series) (even refurb if it helps fit the budget). I also like Yamaha, but my Marantz has been keeping me quite happy"

Over the next few years I'm definitely going to be upgrading the sound, starting with the Receiver, especially once 4k becomes the standard."

Also a great way to add automation with IR light bulbs or heaters/AC.

hometheater,3ajej7,jrussell90,2,Sun Jun 21 12:36:47 2015 UTC,That is actually my situation too. I bought an Onkyo HTiB a few years ago. I gave it to my parents now. I think the Onkyo's were actually decent for the price. $280 for a receiver plus 5.1 so can't expect much.  I like to think of the Def Techs as more than a mid-level speaker though. Plus they have so many levels. You could upgrade just your center to the Procenter 800.   I got 1000's and 800's used and I thought they sounded great. A lot of clarity. The only others I am interested in are Anthony Gallo's. I don't see those discussed much here and they are much more expensive but they have good reviews. I think Def Tech's seem to be a great value for the dollar.

Im moving to a new house and will be using one of the bedrooms as my theater room, but I currently have no idea of the dimensions of the room. I have an Optoma HD66, but I'm thinking I may need to switch to a short throw projector to get the screen size I want. With the Optoma the projector will need to be at least 15 ft from the screen to get a 120"" image, whereas I can a 120"" image from less than 7 feet with the short throw (BenQ W1080ST). To get a large image in a small room, you'll probably want a short throw.  Check out the projector reviews and image calculator at projectorcentral.com. Very useful."

It's 2015, and there are better ways to do this with less hassle.  Upgrade your remote to a Harmony Ultimate. Place the RF hub in the space with your equipment and see if it is a short enough distance to work. If it does, then you have nothing left to do but enjoy.  If this doesn't work, then you can place the RF hub at the television and run a 24-4 data wire from the hub to the area with your equipment. In the box with the remote is a pair of small IR blasters. Cut the wire in half. Splice the plug end at the hub near the television. Splice the blaster end at the media cabinet.   This will let you control your television and your equipment without needing to point the remote at anything. Splicing wire, if you've never done it before, is not difficult at all. Dealing with an IR repeater is never fun, and it always creates little issues. I prefer to not deal with it and use something better."

hometheater,3ak81w,orbitalinterceptor,1 point,Sun Jun 21 00:34:47 2015 UTC,"Hm. I am not familiar with the Xbox, but I'll bet it outputs 1080p, not 4K.  Next, most TV's have some kind of smoothing or image processing features.  Find 'em and try it with them turned off.  Next, manually set the TV to 1080p, take upscaling out of the equation.   If it is still there, the blurs may be in the source material itself. If it's now better, turn one thing at a time back on until the problem reappears.   Another possibility could be network lag while streaming 4K. Try a downloaded local file if you can get one and you have a way to play it.  With a streaming file, look for the data rate of the media. 15 or 20 + mbps (megabits per second) is possible for 4K files. What's the data rate on the Bluray, for comparison?  Motion blur can exist in the source material, particularly if it was shot on film - the shutter is open while actors are moving, if they are quick it can get blurry.   You can even do this when shooting video with your smartphone. Step-framing through filmed action scenes can often look like an impressionist painting at some frames. :-)  See if you can find some footage shot with a digital cinema camera like the Red, and try that.  The problem may not go away, but you'll know where it comes from  and you'll learn a lot about your setup."

It isn't a very large order for me to be getting 3 or 4 30gb movies at a time and storing them all on my HTPC. Cheaper (obviously) and easier than using blu rays and a player."

hometheater,3ajr8e,ProbablyProne,2,Tue Jun 23 05:26:36 2015 UTC,"a 4 gb movie is 1080p in the same way that netflix can stream 4k. It's extremely compressed. It wont have near the same bitrate. Watching it on a macbook or a small TV you may not notice the difference, but with a larger setup, its easy to see what you get with a bigger copy. But yeah, in addition to a higher video bitrate the audio is much, much better. The first thing to be cut down in a small file size is the audio quality. Im not saying its always worth it to find huge copies of movies, but for me it usually is. In some ways I guess its like the difference between 256kbps and FLAC."

Of course, the multichannel input isnt THAT necessary of a feature anymore with the advent of HDMI. the multichannel input feature is meant to be specifically tailored for SACD players and blu-ray players that have nicer DACs in them. but it also keeps your receiver handy as an amp.  hence my recommendation for the harman kardon top end receiver, as it has preamp outputs for all the channels rather than just for sub or just for fronts/heights. same with denon's models, especially their middle-ground lineup."

hometheater,3agfqp,GatorMarley,2,Sat Jun 20 18:11:02 2015 UTC,"This is the one I purchased: http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00M3XC1YU/ref=sr_ph?ie=UTF8&qid=1434981864&sr=1&keywords=led+light+strip   In order to cover more, you just join them together with some male to male connectors (I think they are $5 on Amazon) and you don't need any more than one power source. These are LED, so they don't use very much power and can have several strips hooked up to one power unit."
hometheater,3agfqp,splitsecnd,1 point,Mon Jun 22 14:07:17 2015 UTC,"thank you for this info, it really helps to hear from someone that has done it themselves. I noticed the majority of the reviews for your LED strip are ""1 star"" because it didn't work properly for them. But after reading more it appears that the same company has shorter strips (16 feet) that have solid reviews. I guess I'll just get that as the starting point and then buy more of the same brand of strips. As for the connectors are these the ones I need?  http://www.amazon.com/Glowworm-Natural-Connector-Connecter-Lighting/dp/B00OX2X3QY/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1434984101&sr=8-1&keywords=male+to+male+led+connector  Finally, I wanted to ask if they can create a ""warm white"" like theaters and hotels etc use. Kind of like a slightly orange or yellow white. Or perhaps I need the RGBW (instead of RGB)?"
hometheater,3afjqg,Whats_a_narwhal,1 point,Fri Jun 19 18:47:47 2015 UTC,That is more of a mixer than an amplifier. It's designed to take 9 inputs and mix them into a single output.

hometheater,3afjqg,bXm83,1 point,Fri Jun 19 19:10:39 2015 UTC,"Well it is an amplifier in that you could wire some speakers together to it, but I think its actually purpose would be to connect some microphones to it and us it as part of a PA system. Not a very good one mind you. Unless I am just way off base on what that is."

hometheater,3afdl4,h2omojo,3,Fri Jun 19 18:01:28 2015 UTC,"I think that's plenty big enough. I'm not an expert in HT design, but I would think it's less about the projector and more about the size screen you go with. I have a sub-level room above our basement that I turned into our theater. It's not much bigger than the size you mention and we have a 110"" screen. Hope that helps."
hometheater,3afdl4,Tr35W,2,Fri Jun 19 18:33:49 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I was going with a 100"" screen"
hometheater,3afdl4,arockbiter,3,Fri Jun 19 19:07:36 2015 UTC,of course it is.  Won't even need a short throw projector.  I prefer theaters where the screen takes up a majority of the wall.  Makes the screen appear even bigger than it is.
hometheater,3afdl4,invenio78,3,Fri Jun 19 18:40:49 2015 UTC,Find out how far you will be sitting from the screen.  See what size screen you will need for optimal viewing using the chart below.  Then compare prices of TV's vs projectors/screen that would meet that requirement.  TV size vs viewing distance graph:  http://i.imgur.com/xhh0M.png
hometheater,3afdl4,BornOnFeb2nd,1 point,Sat Jun 20 17:25:00 2015 UTC,"It might be a little snug, but it'd be equally snug with a TV, really...  Biggest issue will be dealing with people walking through the image getting to seating and such, but far from a deal-breaker..  If you're BUILDING, you might want to pre-wire the HELL out of that room... Look into an Atmos 7.2.4 setup or something..  save yourself some grief, and use conduit!  Now, I would suggest you actually go larger on that screen.    It's so much simpler to cover up a part of a screen you're not using with velvet or something.   It's a LOT more effort/expense to make a small screen larger.  Running it through the calculator... it looks like your room could support a 165"" screen (assuming nothing major on the edges)...  Now, why would you do that?    When 4K projectors get sane prices, and you upgrade, you could be sitting 6' away from that beast of a screen, and still not make out all the pixels.  It'd be like an imax in your own house!   Obviously, compare the prices.  Also, Look into Harmony remotes.  They're quite handy."
hometheater,3afdl4,nickmdp,2,Fri Jun 19 21:27:41 2015 UTC,"This sounds like really bad advice to me.  Atmos 7.2.4 and a 165"" screen in a room under 200 square feet?  Maybe if I were a contractor looking to take this guy to the cleaners I'd suggest that, but that is beyond overkill.  If a contractor tried to convince me to buy two subs for a room that size, I would kindly tell them to not talk to me again.  OP is looking for a media room, not an IMAX.  A 100"" will fit that room fairly well depending on exact layout, and 5.1 is probably going to be hard enough to fit in so that you don't have seating positions less than 2-3 feet away from the surrounds.  A 165"" screen also means there's going to be almost no chance of seating within 8 feet unless you want to have a 70 degree viewing angle (higher than an IMAX).  Most people would recommend a viewing distance of 1.5 times the screen size, so even 120"" would be just fine for a room of that size if they intended to have seating against the wall."
hometheater,3agw55,boredman4,1 point,Sat Jun 20 01:49:35 2015 UTC,"I think those are analog Audio inputs in your stereo.  You can run a 3.5mm to RCA cable from your tv to your stereo if your TV has a headphone audio out.   You could also run RCA cables from the audio out of anycomponent (cable box, bd, etc) to the stereo if your TV doesn't have an audio out."
hometheater,3agw55,lHeeerO,1 point,Sat Jun 20 02:03:39 2015 UTC,"You need to figure out what kind of outs are on your TV. If it has the red/white audio outs, just connect that cable. If it has a headphone jack, use what the other guy suggested. If it has an optical or coax audio out, then you'll need to hunt down a converter box for that."
hometheater,3aeutt,DanOpii,6,Fri Jun 19 15:37:30 2015 UTC,"Only two current flaws. One is the sub isn't as ""bassy"" as I would have assumed but I've been told this is because it's a home theater sub and not just to play loud music which I've come to appreciate a bit more (So not a flaw I suppose, just wasn't what i expected).   Not sure why someone would tell you that. For the money the Dayton is pretty good. I've found, that many people who come from car audio background WAY OVER ESTIMATE the amount of bass that should be in most music recordings.   Like /u/000Destruct0 said, don't buy Klipsch or even the Bic Formula series without listening if you can. Horn loaded speakers like that tend to be a bit love or hate.   Depending on your budget here are a few lists of some of the better regarded products in Bookshelf and tower speakers."
hometheater,3aeutt,AverageJoeAudiophile,2,Fri Jun 19 17:29:24 2015 UTC,"Speakers will have the biggest impact on the sound. That being said, if you have not listened to Klipsch speakers do not buy them. They have a very distinct sound - extremely bright to the point some find them harsh and fatiguing while others love them. Regardless I do not recommend buying them without hearing Klipsch speakers first.  Without a budget it's difficult to make any kind of real recommendation. Based on what you have I'm going to assume you do not have stacks of cash to spend. If this were me, if I could afford it I would purchase Wavecrest HVL-1 speakers to replace the L/R mains and center channel ($295 plus shipping) as that would make a huge impact on the sound quality."
hometheater,3aeutt,000Destruct0,1 point,Fri Jun 19 16:11:29 2015 UTC,My budget is kind of unknown as of right now.  I understand this makes things hard but I have no idea what I'm going to end up with at the end of summer and that will kind of dictate what I can put forward.    Also it would be ideal if I could sell the components i'm going to replace to make it more affordable.  I just don't what to price things out at.  Thanks for the quick reply!  The Wavecrest's look awesome.  So you just use the same speaker for the center?  Never heard of that before but then again I don't know much at all!
hometheater,3aeutt,000Destruct0,1 point,Fri Jun 19 17:29:12 2015 UTC,"Yes, that is the ideal setup. The MTM layout of typical dedicated center channel speakers is not ideal and is a result of aesthetics over performance."
hometheater,3aeutt,Armsc,1 point,Fri Jun 19 17:33:49 2015 UTC,In looking at your list I think you have a fairly solid foundation to work with.  If you think that everything is good but the sub then I would focus on upgrading the sub.  If you're handy you can put a new driver in the Dayton and see if that will cure your issues.  Of course you would want to do some research to see which option would work the best for the upgrade.  You could also just buy a better sub and go from there.  If you need some options to look at feel free to ask as I'm sure you'll get plenty of opinions.

If you do end up with a projector I'd warn against buying a pull-up (cant remember the proper term) screen like I did because it's almost unusable due to the screen not being taut.

So you will take the RCA output of the projector and run it into an amp (which will almost certainly have RCA inputs) and then go from the Amp to the speakers with either just bare speaker wires or speaker wires with banana plugs.   Might be worth popping into an AV shop like Sevenoaks and getting them to sort you out with the audio gear, it might cost a bit more than amazon but they'll make sure you have everything you need.

Wireless is really out of your budget for something reasonable.  Have you considered a compromise on one of the Marantz Slim receivers?  They're smaller than your average receiver.  It's very possible you could consider a compromise on a nice pair of bookshelf speakers and one of those or an amp if it was a 2.0 or 2.1.  Though they are going to be a pricier option.  Do you own the property?  Could you run wire in walls?  You're looking at more work there but honestly if I just dropped almost $1000 on a TV I would rather put more into the audio budget to get something I'd be happy with than something that's not up-gradable.  If looks are such a concern you could also look at in wall speakers or something like the Polk OWM3 which are pretty decent budget speakers and are easily wall mountable for a pretty nice look (it's what I use as rears in my system) and they look pretty nice on our walls.

I'll have to stick with the best option I can find for like $250. Next year when i would own a place hopefully is when the fun begins.
hometheater,3aeln4,llamatrauma58,2,Fri Jun 19 19:09:47 2015 UTC,"Will you use the soundbar elsewhere in a year?  If not, I would just deal with the TV speakers for that long.  A soundbar at the price range you're looking at is not going to be THAT much better than the TV speakers to be perfectly honest.  I would just save the cash and then put it into next year's upgrade."
hometheater,3aeln4,Bondidude,1 point,Fri Jun 19 19:15:16 2015 UTC,"I also work in the HT dept at Best buy. For that price I would go with the vizio. If you cab get your hands on a 2014 vizio soundbar with wireless sub, they usually run around $200 to $250. Totally worth it. I have a 2013 2.1 system that has been absolutely fantastic."

hometheater,3aeln4,ballinc,1 point,Fri Jun 19 19:15:48 2015 UTC,"If you're looking for this as just a temporary solution I would just settle for a basic 2.1 soundbar setup and save the rest of your money for next year. Not like wireless satellite speakers in a soundbar bundle are going to be top notch anyways. Just wouldn't be right to have such a nice display tv and settle for a cheap soundbar as a long term solution.  Costco Vizio SB3821W for $150 shipped, pretty sure don't need to be a member is a pretty solid deal for a ""budget soundbar""   This will still give you audio that's well above the built in tv speakers for $100 under budget. Also in a year it's not like this becomes worthless, it will be extremely easy to move to another room like the bedroom. Or even can treat it as a portable bluetooth speaker that is way better quality than those small pill ones. At the very least, you buy this for $150, in a year when you're ready to upgrade, throw it on craigslist for around $100 and someone will easily buy it, and you just rented pretty decent audio for like $4 a month."

hometheater,3adw4q,homeboi808,1 point,Fri Jun 19 16:03:25 2015 UTC,i thought the refresh rate is what makes the picture quality that much better? i dont really use blu ray
hometheater,3adw4q,homeboi808,1 point,Fri Jun 19 16:17:23 2015 UTC,"PS4 and cable boxes are 60Hz/fps. Buying a 240Hz TV and playing 60Hz will look absolutely no different. Tv's have to be showing their refresh rate at all time, for 60Hz, it will play your 60fps gameplay with each frame being shown once at 1/60th of a second, 240Hz will show you 60fps gameplay with each frame being shown 4 times at 1/240th of a second, which looks exactly the same.    Something 240Hz can do is motion interpolation, which shows each frame with fake in-between frames, basically, your TV will take frames 1 & 2 and try to figure out what is happening in-between. The two main downsides is that it looks terrible, and it takes time to compute, which for gaming, is something you always want to avoid.    The only reason to buy a 120Hz TV is to show 24fps Blu-ray content (120/24=5) meaning it shows each frame five times at 1/120th the speed. 240Hz should only be a need if you want to watch 48fps Blu-ray (The Hobbit Trilogy) on the new UHD blu-ray's coming out in December. 60Hz will show 24fps content with a 3:2 pull down, meaning sometimes it shows a frame 2x and the next frame 3x, and the next 2x, which looks weird.    With all that being said, as I mentioned before, the companies put all the bells and whistles (including 240Hz) on their best models."

hometheater,3adw4q,llamatrauma58,0,Tue Jun 23 10:41:58 2015 UTC,"Refresh rate is over-considered in TV buying decisions. The two things that are most important in motion clarity are video processing and the type of lighting technology used (flashing or scanning).  With that being said for your budget I would go with the 65"" Vizio M series. It is backlit compared to edge-lit. And has 32 active LED zones. Great uniformity and the best input lag of any 2015 tv make it a great choice for anyone who needs good picture quality for movies or video games.

You need a projector with a native resolution of 1080p, and that one is closer to 720. Blowing up your screen on that wall with so little resolution won't be so pretty. Also, look for a 16:9 ratio projector screen, that is 1:1. Unless you really want the top and bottom fifths to not have anything projected on them."

Not that there aren't better, but the cost:quality ratio is the best. That projector also would produce a widescreen 16:9 image, so it would need to be put on a 16:9 screen.

hometheater,3ad9im,Sirmossy,1 point,Fri Jun 19 04:18:46 2015 UTC,"Well, that's weird. HDMI, I assume? And it occurs on all the different inputs on your Onkyo receiver?  Since it doesn't occur on direct input - and, I assume, you're using the same cables and such - it's definitely a problem with the receiver. I saw your AVS Forum post saying you're using an Onkyo 616. Is the 616 the successor or at all related to the 606? Several models of Onkyo receivers had capacitor issues that resulted in distorted or no picture over HDMI. I had to replace the capacitors on my HT-R670 myself to resolve a ""no picture over HDMI"" problem a year ago, so I wonder if you're in the early stages of that?  Here's a link to a walkthrough of how I did it (your board may be slightly different) - http://www.avsforum.com/forum/90-receivers-amps-processors/1246078-how-diy-tx-sr576-tx-sr606-etc-hdmi-daughterboard-repair-dummies-28.html#post25177362"

To put it in extremely blunt terminology: sitting 5 feet away from 5 separate speakers is not a home theater. the measurements of the speaker and the way the speakers blend their sound together at that range has no time to actually do 5.1 stuff, so you'd be able to tell which speaker it is coming from really easily. you dont get the illusion of 360 degree sound. you get 5 distinct places the sound comes from.  Put yet another way: it doesnt sound like you're actually there (which is what it is supposed to sound like). it sounds like there are 5 speakers, each playing their own thing."
hometheater,3abdc2,Whats_a_narwhal,1 point,Sat Jun 20 01:26:54 2015 UTC,"It definitely does not sound like that to me, but I appreciate the explanation.

High efficiency is a hallmark of Klipsch speakers, as such they produce prodigious amounts of sound pressure with little power.   You need to get a pair of Klipsch speakers to replace the Polks. As such you should be able to get by with a moderately powered amp, 80-100 watts per channel is more than enough unless earbleed is your goal.  Additionally, your room is a bit small to be using a 7.1 system. A good 5.1 system will  work better.  Finally, without a budget it is impossible to make any kind of reasonable recommendation."

hometheater,3ac4ov,afuckingHELICOPTER,1 point,Thu Jun 18 22:12:40 2015 UTC,"You have asked many questions, so please forgive my no doubt terrible formatting which will happen.  To your first question, the size of your screen is usually determined by a few factors. Ideally, what you would want to do is figure out your viewing distance and then decide what would be the ""right"" size screen for that room. What is considered the ""right size"" depends on who you ask, but here are some references:  http://myhometheater.homestead.com/viewingdistancecalculator.html  http://www.draperinc.com/ProjectionScreens/CustomSizeCalculator.aspx  My main setup at my place is about 16 feet of viewing distance for 120"" screen, which is pretty ridiculous. My setup is almost ""too big"", although it depends on what you're doing. For watching movies and ""cinematic"" content, its great. For gaming, there are times when it feels a little too big, as I have to swivel my eyes around to see stuff in the corners of the screen. This is not the ideal setup for like twitchy multi-player shooters. Overall, I'd say 100"" @ 14 feet is probably fine.  It might make sense to rough out / test this first. You can set up the seating like it will be in the final install, then on the wall where your screen will be, just mark out a rough area with some tape. Now, see how much of your ""screen"" area is in your field of vision.   The other thing is, your projector will generally have a minimum & maximum throw distance for any given screen size, which will determine where the projector will be mounted."
hometheater,3ac4ov,DivinityCycle,1 point,Thu Jun 18 22:35:40 2015 UTC,"For your second question, you have 2 options: ceiling mount or table ""mount"". In both cases, your vertical spacing is somewhat determined by the projector, but generally most projectors shoot out an image which starts some distance below the mount height, generally 1 to 3 feet. This depends on the throw distance and lense options in the projector you're using.   When mounting on a table, the same is true, just upside down. The projector will be throwing an image out above the height it is at, with a distance varying by throw distance & projector type.  In most cases people seem to prefer ceiling mounts because it's much easier to walk in front of and bump a projector on a table, and more difficult to hide cabling.  For the horizontal alignment, the projector will be dead center on the image being projected, generally speaking.  Most people who do ceiling mounts also just run long cables to the projector. My current setup has I think a 25' electrical cable and a 50' ""RedMere"" HDMI cable, both from MonoPrice. I live in an apartment so I don't have the option of running cabling through walls, so I just have some cable channeling stuck to the ceiling and then tracking around the room right where the ceiling and walls meet to hide the cabling and keep it out of the way."

Home Theater knowledge is great when it comes to sales and picking out the best products, but you'll need some other skills to go with it if you want to do this full time.  Don't necessarily have to be able to build the basement from scratch but you'll need to be somewhat handy to give people what they want. Wall mounting and connecting cables is something a basic consumer might just pay best buy to do when they buy their tv.  The money is had in creating a true home theater ""experience"". Setting up quality surround sound, programming a universal remote to control the whole room (people love to show it off), installing carpet and creating platform seating, hooking up dimmable led lights around the room. Other things might include being able to build a small mini-bar, setup a kegerator for them or install mini fridge, get them to buy one of those fresh popcorn machines.  Basically give people something that will wow their friends and they can show off.

And even my one model newer than this one supports DD+, but requires a firmware fix that isn't available for my model, just the ones newer than mine. So he can still use NF with stereo, and I can listen to 5.1 with a barely noticeable bug.

hometheater,3a84f1,raeanin,2,Thu Jun 18 04:51:20 2015 UTC,"Really depends on whether you prefer cinema-like viewing angle or picture quality.  Personally I prefer larger viewing angle. Home theater to me is making a cinema-like experience at home. At 10' I would probably be looking at a projector, but a 75 or 80"" screen would be acceptable at that range, and an entry level should be around the same price as that OLED set."
hometheater,3a84f1,llamatrauma58,2,Thu Jun 18 02:21:02 2015 UTC,"OLED is the most groundbreaking technology to hit televisions in a long time. Some would argue that UHD resolution is bigger, and it is. It has a much larger hold on consumers because it is a higher resolution, which directly improves picture quality. 4K is also available on OLED tv's though. Namely the LGEC9600, which is a fantastic piece of work, and is available in larger sizes than 55"", but it costs a pretty penny. But let me explain why I think OLED would be better for you. It is a true LED picture. The other TV's you see on the market, that are deemed as ""LED"" are actually just LCD technology. OLED actually has an LED for each individual pixel that operates independently from one another, giving it the ability to shut pixels all the way off resulting in deep true blacks and a virtually infinite contrast ratio. Without the need for a backlight, OLED has a perfect uniformity rating, and an astounding motion clarity rating. If you were a fan of Plasma's high refresh rate that made motion insanely smooth, then you'll love what OLED has to offer. With all of these things in mind, the fact that the screen is only 4"" bigger than your current television should not be as much of an issue, since the picture will be clearer with a higher resolution of 1080p as opposed to 720p.  Edit- TL;DR OLED is the best. And go for quality. When you go for size without quality, it only gets worse the bigger the screen is."

hometheater,3a84f1,chasempayne,1 point,Thu Jun 18 16:50:14 2015 UTC,"While it is true 4k is an upgrade, the content being sold for it is actually poorly optimized and you can actually get an image less sharp than 1080p. Just read below for explaination of what the problem is.  A lot of articles seem to focus on the benefits of our 20/20 vision and how close you have to be to see 4k. But what they don't tell you is that our 20/20 vision is limited to about 15-20 degrees field of view. The best ranges of our vision is between 30-40 degrees field of view. After that limit, the overall resolution of our eye is really bad and our brain fills in the gaps.  So why mention this? Well 1080p TV's are actually really great for our vision because they fit at 36 degrees field of view if you sit at the proper distance. The way content is shot in today, the 1080 pixels of 2K projection fall 34% short of the 1628 pixels required to create a seamless picture. So in reality, the best resolution for our eye is about 1440p.  So what is happening is, people are sitting closer to their TV shifting the field of view from 36 to 60 degrees which would be okay if the video content actually shifted the recorded field of view, but they are not. THey are keeping it the same as 1080p because, there's an advantage to recording in 4k and then downsampling to 1080p it makes the image look much better on a 1080p set. They will make far more money doing it this way, because it would be supported on both 4k and 1080p and they can charge you more for the higher resolution version even though it was shot in 4k to begin with for other reasons.  I know some people think 4k can't look better on 1080p, but it's more than that. Since all video is compressed to 4:2:0 chroma subsampling, when you downsample a 4:2:0 4k video to 1080p, it shares the chroma values with the other pixels making the 1080p content 4:4:4 chroma. This makes 1080p significantly sharper, just look up comparison videos online.  Think of it, have you seen a movie at the cinema recently? Did you know they have been projecting 4k for quite a long time? The TV at home you have appears much sharper, you always just assumed it was because it was the screen size right? Well screen size never actually mattered, since all displays have fixed pixels if you sit at the proper distance to resolve all pixels without seeing the grid it will end up at the exact same field of view. A 28 inch screen at 2 feet is the exact same as a 120 inch screen at 8 feet.  It looks sharper because a 1080p TV at home in proper position is about 32 degrees field of view, only about 10-15 degrees off perfect 20/20 acuity. A 4k TV/Movie Cinema is over 50 degrees field of view, only the center is really sharp but the overall image is blurrier because we only see 20/20 between 10-15 degrees in our eyes. They would be able to fix this, by adjusting the field of view when recording video but this is not likely going to happen as this content would only be viewable on a 4k TV screen and look really bad on 1080p that they would not be able to sell on both resolutions unless they recorded the movie in two different angles, making it much more expensive. 3d ran into a similar problem, it unfortunately died because it was too expensive, the only reason it exists today is because computers can render 2d to 3d really well now. But unfortunately, you can't render a different field of view unless the movie is actually CGI.  PS: It is not the display manufacturers fault that 4k is poorly optimized, they just make the display. It's the media content that is ruining the potential of 4k"
hometheater,3a84f1,karlpopperspenguin,2,Fri Jun 19 07:10:17 2015 UTC,"Once you understand how field of view works, you will realize that screen size does not actually mean anything.   Because all displays are at a fixed resolution, your goal is to sit the exact distance to where you take full benefit of the resolution by being able to see all pixels, without actually physically seeing the individual pixel grid itself.  A larger display allows you to move further back than normal, but in the end if you sit at the distance where you cannot see the pixel grid, it ends up being the same field of view as a smaller TV sitting at a closer distance.  Essentially, screen size does not matter at all. A 28 inch screen at 4k is equivalent to a 120 inch screen at 4k at 8 feet.

They are really great sounding speakers, and were an even bigger upgrade than I initially thought they would be.  I have all three sitting vertical and enjoy how clear everything is, and how it gets good and loud when I want it to without being fatiguing on the ears.  I was on the fence about 3.0 with the center placed on its side, but vertically it really shines.  Just last night I was watching my newly arrived copy of Spirited Away on Blu-ray.  I didn't expect the audio to wow me like it did, seeing as it's such a gorgeous movie, but the detail on it really impressed.    For people shopping speaker options, the Wavecrests are an interesting choice being affordable and decidedly not boom-sizzle speakers that tend to wow people most.  That's up to personal preference though.  I come from a background of playing guitar.  I learned a long time ago that if you don't have great mids in the mix, then you don't really have anything, so I commend Wavecrest on hitting a low internet direct price point on a speaker design and build that would probably collect dust in a store competing against popular brands with poor mids.        I think the only minor criticism I have of them is that the speaker they're modeled after (Ascend CBM-170 SE) doesn't cost too much more, and that's a better unit all around.  Bigger driver, bigger size, better components, etc, but that's a slippery slope as staying within budget is a real thing for many of us.  I'm honestly so content with the Wavecrests that I don't think I even want to know what difference that extra $50+ per speaker would make to my ears."

You go into the carpeted area which is right above the sub and you can't feel it at all. I know that's stating the obvious, but the amount of low end you can feel in the kitchen is really impressive.

Understanding the limitations of it, it probably wouldn't be a bad projector for lugging about, but I wouldn't build a theater around it.  Regarding using it outdoors, just remember that the sun will always win.    If a ray of sunshine touches your projected image, it's toast, and the area around it as well will be spectacularly whited out too.  Keep the projection surface in the shade (and the projector probably wouldn't enjoy direct sunlight itself, either)  Let's call this projector ""a good first step."""

hometheater,3a768m,naturr,2,Wed Jun 17 19:31:52 2015 UTC,I think it depends on what you are coming from.  I'm used to the motion on my Plasma so a lot of the LCD TVs I have seen bother me. I never used to notice motion issues when my primary display was LCD. I'm sure you just get used to it. Find a set you like and buy it somewhere like Bestbuy where you can return it if the motion bothers you.
hometheater,3a768m,DominusNestor,2,Thu Jun 18 03:35:29 2015 UTC,"Motion blur is directly compared with a native refresh rate. Many TV's you see today have a refresh rate listed as 120Hz or 240Hz. However, what most people used to ignore is that the native refresh rates of the content going into your TV maxes out at 24Hz (which is Blu-Ray). So it has become more common that people will say that it doesn't matter.  But motion blur does in fact matter. A TV smooths out motion using 3 components:   The native refresh rate(which really doesn't matter all that much)  The type of backlight used (scanning or flashing)  and, the image processor (which is where the bulk of smoothness derives)  So that is where you'll see the difference, and it really is quite noticeable when you compare high end video processing to low end processing.   But given what you are used to you will not see much of a difference going to a mid-level set. So with that being said, if you do want a noticeably smoother image, you'll have to look at those three components combined."
hometheater,3a768m,llamatrauma58,1 point,Thu Jun 18 05:16:32 2015 UTC,Is it safe to say then that my 10 year old LCD set was a mere 60hz and the lowest end sets now are double that.  Backlighting and image processing is also better on the lowest end sets.  So with all that said anything I get Vizio on up should be at least as good but arguably much better than what I have correct?

hometheater,3a80b4,MasterShake2003,2,Wed Jun 17 23:12:05 2015 UTC,"That is a great TV. It is the best bang for your buck you can get. I agree with u/Bill_Money that it is considered a ""low end"" set for Vizio. But it is still the best budget deal you can get on a TV for 2014 or 2015. It has full-array backlighting that most manufacturers only put on their highest end TV's. It is a very underutilized technology that increases the uniformity of your picture drastically. I'll explain what it really is if you are not familiar already. All LED TV's are either Edge-Lit, Direct Lit, or have Full-Array, referring to the placements of their LED's. Edge-lit means that the LED's are placed around the edge of the panel and the light shines inward toward the middle of the screen, Direct lit means that the LED's are directly behind the panel, but do not have local-dimming (which is important), and Full-Array is essentially the same as Direct, but with local-dimming. So Full-Array is the best backlighting you can get.   Also, if you like gaming this is a phenomenal choice. It has a motion blur response time of just 14.6ms and an input lag of 29.5ms, which are both top 10 among LED TV's at the average consumer level of 2015.   Unfortunately though, it only has one HDMI input, but can be quickly remedied with a HDMI selector.   I say with the budget you have mentioned, this is by far the best  TV you can get, and I say go for it.   And if you are still skeptical, David Katzmaier for CNET, wrote a great article explaining why he loves this TV. He is a great writer that I have followed over the years that is unbiased and makes informed suggestions."

hometheater,3a4ya6,tishaoberoi,3,Wed Jun 17 07:00:04 2015 UTC,"X is (number of amplifier channels).(number of preouts for subwoofers).  Y depends on how much the manufacturer is trying to fudge the numbers. If they don't list number of channels driven then it's safe to assume that's with just 2 channels. Typically the wattage will decrease per channel with the more channels active. If you're shopping for receivers, home theater websites will post reviews with test results to see the difference (check Sound and Vision website).    Ohms are the resistance presented by your speakers, 8 is standard (and this is an average as it depends on frequency). If you're speakers are lower, say 4-6 ohms, and your receiver doesn't claim to work with lower resistance speakers, this can lead to overheating and is bad.   To figure out db, you have to know your speakers sensitivity. So if your speaker is rated at 89 db, 1 watt of power will get you 89 db. From there you gain 3 db every time you double the watts (ex. 2 watts = 92 db). So you can quickly see there is not much practical difference between 100 watts and 125 watt channel in terms of volume.   There are exceptions but this is the basic answer. The tldr is that beginners don't really need to worry about this with the possible exception of pairing low ohm speakers with a cheap avr not specced to drive them."

Is there some upper range / lower range one should be careful about considering buying AVR with these kind of configuration ?"
hometheater,3a4ya6,ss0889,1 point,Wed Jun 17 19:48:39 2015 UTC,"X channels: the first number is the number of speakers/satellites. the second number is the number of subwoofers. This doesnt mean you actually get 2 stereo subwoofers, it just means that you dont have to buy your own Y splitter for multiple subwoofers. Its meant for even dispersion of sound, since subwoofers can get boomy in one place and too quiet in other places in the room. having multiple subwoofers lets you go, obviously, louder with the bass. but the idea is not to turn up the bass that much, its to use both subwoofers at a reasonable and evened out volume so that you get about the same bass from all points in the room.  the 2/5/7/9/13 first number means how many speakers you'll place around your room. 2.1 means 2 speakers and 1 subwoofer. 5.1 means you also have a center and 2 rear speakers. 7.1 means you'll have an additional 2 rear speakers. there are diagrams showing where to place all these for optimal sound, i'm not gonna get into that here.  the Y watts is exactly what it says. given a speaker of a certain resistance/impedanec (in ohms), it will put a certain amount of voltage/current into that speaker. voltage times current equals power in watts. the impedance of a speaker changes at various frequencies though, so you need some sort of average number. Furthermore, wattage listed doesnt mean wattage used.  Think of your volume knob like a dimmer switch on a lightbulb. if you only need enough light to see where you're going, you wont bother using the full 100 watts of the light bulb. if you need it to be bright as day, you'll crank that knob. similarly, with actual day to day listening, you'll not use more than 15-30 watts of power. In addition to this, the closer you are to the speakers, the less power you need to actually get them loud. things sound softer as they get far away. so unless you have some ginormous room, wattage is practically a moot point.  RMS is an ""average"" way to give out wattage numbers. you can have an amplifier rated for 200 watts RMS thats capable of putting out WAY more, for a tiny period of time. Like say theres some hugely loud portion?  your wattage will increase. but your amp will get hot as fuck trying to do it. so RMS is an average reading. peak is the other one, that says this amplifier will output this much power MAX. and you can definitely try to raise the volume past that but it will start to sound like shit and possibly damage your speakers and probably damage the amp when it clips (tries to put out more power than it can physically manage).  the DB stuff is a sensitivity, generally. it is usually listed as decibals per watt meter. what it means is that if you take a speaker and put it 1 meter away from you and feed it 1 watt of power, it will produce a noise that is at the listed db in terms of volume. volume decreases exponentially as you get farther. for each 3db increase in volume, you need to provide double the power. I'm not going to get into the specifics here. It is largely unnecessary to know unless you're in a lab environment. What you need to know: put the speakers where you want them. if you have to crank your volume knob past about 60% to get the sound output you need, you need a bigger amp. if you start hearing crackling and whatnot, you need speakers that will handle more power without blowing up.  Just to note here: 89-92 is a fairly average/common sensitivity. 100+ will be ridiculously easy to drive. below 87 and you'll need some fucking power to get good loudness out of it.  Z channels driven: This is the one where i might be wrong, and i have yet to find a clear answer to it, so i'll post my understanding and anyone can correct me with sources listed. From my reading, i've gathered that an amp listed with X watts, Z channels driven, is going to be able to drive Z channels (2, for example) and reliably put out X watts of power on average. In a multichannel movie like 5.1 or 7.1, the amp will need to split time and power between each channel. so the loudness you get from stereo music listening will be a lot louder than what the amp will give you if you try to watch a movie.  Now, the thign to remember is, in a multichannel movie, you dont often have maximum sound coming from each speaker. thats just not how they are mixed. so 2 channels driven (constant left/right) is what most manufacturers will list. Realistically, if you have 200 watts per channel 2 channels driven, you will not even get close to that in a multichannel movie setup. You also probably wont get close to 200 watts in a stereo setup, because in order to make 200 watts of power, your receiver needs to eat more than that. you cant get more energy out than what you put in.  either way, it is mostly a moot point because you will never actually turn up the volume that loud without damaging something.  tl;dr: dont worry about it. go to /r/zeos and get a budget put together and an upgrade path. its far easier to shoot from the hip here and just make informed purchases to begin with rather than waste time with specs that need to be modified heavily to fit your requirements."

There are some dirt cheap ones out there,  I've had a Seiki 55"" for over a year, I only bought it because it was $499 at Sears, which at the time was good for a 1080p 55"". The smaller pixels do in fact have advantages, I sit maybe 8-9 feet from the set. It is noticeable assuming your vision is good enough even on 1080p content. For the record this set was exclusive to Sears and uses the same v by one panel and driver as the Sony 55.   I got my son the 39"" version for about $200 when they were clearing those out. It has most of the same advantages but has some differences due to the different driver designs it is more similar to the 50"".  That said I've seen the 50"" ones on clearance for sub $300 locally. If you want to try one that's a good price to pay for a lower end one. As far as the reliability complaints about Seiki, I service TVs. They're no worse than any other brand, just run of the mill off the shelf components. If it makes it a couple of months it probably will last a couple of years."

hometheater,3a4c0i,guardianxrx2,1 point,Wed Jun 17 03:12:57 2015 UTC,"The M-series is a great TV for semi-dark rooms. It has a fantastic contrast ratio that will keep the blacks on the screen much darker even when the lights are off. Also it has Full-Array backlighting which makes the picture much more uniform than those that are edge-lit (which are most TV's). And with it's 32 local-dimming zones, you will see very little ""haloing"" that is common in a darker room. It also has the best input lag of any average consumer level LED of 2015 at just 15.1ms.  The only downside is that there is a little motion blur that would be better in many other options.   As far as the 4K goes, your'e only future proofing yourself when you buy it. I'm sure you expect the next TV you purchase to last you at least around 7 or 8 years. So if you buy a non 4K set now, and the content is available within say 2 years, then you are unable to see that content until you purchase your next tv. At which point there will probably be a new resolution that you'll be facing the same dilemma with. I have been anti-4K until very recently when I really though about it. It makes sense to buy 4K now because if you don't the content will be readily available a long time before your'e ready to replace this TV."

Also for any gamer set your receiver to NOT do ""auto input lag compensation"" on my yammy it is called lipsync. You can set it on a per input basis. I first started doing it with my Wii u to get the audio coming out of the gamepad to match the system but I realized that the audio works much better live for video games.

You can do the tv behind the projector screen, but I've found it's pretty nice to be able to use them simultaneously.  With gaming you want a little smaller viewing angle as you need to react quickly to all corners of the screen whereas with movies you can get the bigger screen and just follow along passively.  Your ideal seating for each activity is probably different as well as most people will sit up to game and lean back for movies."

Bear in mind, a LOT depends on your room.  If you can avoid wireless, and instead just bury the wires in the walls, or baseboards, I think your budget will go further.  And please understand that while it's a lot of money, $10,000 will go VERY quickly if you don't budget appropriately.  A lot of people will hear that number and through out very high-end equipment.  But if you buy $5,000 speakers, and only have enough money for an all-in-one receiver, you aren't going get the most value out of your system.  Also it's easy to spend a ton of money on equipment, and then have nothing left over for the right furniture to store / display / enjoy your setup.    Feel free to PM me, and I can help steer you in a direction that suits your needs.  And as someone who had to get my own fiance on board, I can help give some pointers that may make the system more family friendly."
hometheater,3a31td,citycat23,5,Tue Jun 16 23:55:23 2015 UTC,There are plenty of us on this board where 10k still isn't a big budget. It's not all college students.

hometheater,3a4nu4,elgraysoReddit,1 point,Wed Jun 17 05:01:03 2015 UTC,Can you hook it up to your pc and use MyHarmony to change it?
hometheater,3a4nu4,Xathroz,1 point,Wed Jun 17 08:33:27 2015 UTC,"when you program the activity for Cable, it should ask you where you control the volume, in which case you would say Sony Sound bar. if you need to edit it, you can change the individual mappings for each button.  edit:  you only have one ""activity"" on that remote. cant do what your asking without going to a higher end Harmony.   however, a work around might be this:  go to setup the cable box, and go to add or fix a command and teach the Roku setting volume controls using your sony remote  https://support.myharmony.com/en/teach-harmony-a-missing-command"
hometheater,3a4nu4,e60deluxe,1 point,Wed Jun 17 14:25:13 2015 UTC,"so it sounds like you are saying that in order to control the volume and play/pause on the same ""page"" (ie, not flip between CABLE, DVD, etc. I'm calling these ""pages""), you need a higher end harmony remote?  I don't know why this remote gets such good reviews if this is the case. If it's dark (and the remote is hard to see and fumble with) and I want to lower the audio because it's too loud, I can't just use the volume buttons, I have to go to a different ""page"" first. But then the roku controls no longer work because it is no longer on that ""page"". So basically, you have to memorize which page you last were on, and know that the button you press, say volume control, may not work when you need it, if you are on the wrong page.  I feel like the remote should be able to control these basics all on the same page, but it sounds like its one device per ""page."" ?  Let me know if this is correct and I will look into a better model."
hometheater,3a4nu4,e60deluxe,1 point,Wed Jun 17 17:37:05 2015 UTC,"Harmony remotes work a little different than the typical universal remote. On a typical remote, you will program each device and usually there is an option for a Volume Punch Through. So you set up your Roku and then you set it up with a Volume Punch Through for your TV or Sound system.   Harmony remotes focus everything around ""Activities""  So you create your Activity for ""Watch TV"" lets say, and it changes the TV to the correct input, and the button layout is completley customizable. for example, you can have the Volume buttons be mapped to the TV for cable, but mapped to the sound system for watch DVD, or anything else you like in any fashion you like.   When you press a device button on a Harmony, you control a device entirley. you can still map functions how you want, but only within one device.   normally this is not a problem, you generally use ""Activities"" for general use, but if you need to access specific functions of a device like a TV or AVR, you could hit the device button for that and control it that way. ""device"" mode is rarley used once everything is set up.   the problem with your remote is that there is only 1 ""Activity""  I had assumed that you had already assigned that activity to something, but now it sounds like you havent set up any Activities at all.   Suppose you go into the MyHarmony software and set up the ""watch TV Activity"" the wizard will ask you which device controls volume, in which case you select the Sony Sound System.   If you need only 1 Activity, you are fine. if you need more, then you will need a better remote."
hometheater,3a4nu4,e60deluxe,1 point,Wed Jun 17 20:02:56 2015 UTC,"No I guess I didnt see the ""activities"" area in the software. It let me choose which device I wanted to control, and then drag the functions over to the buttons. It works perfectly, but only when I click on the device first (CABLE"" is roku and ""DVD"" is sony soundbar for example).  But it sounds like you are saying that all of these can be controlled at once if it is set as one ""activity""?  I will dig around in the software when I get home :-)"
hometheater,3a4ieq,ScratchMax,2,Wed Jun 17 04:09:16 2015 UTC,"You need one of two things.   1) an amp that can run at least 4 ohm stable, or in 70volts (a lot of out door speakers are on 70v tap settings.) If you havent bought your speakers yet it determines the amp you get when you do.   2) a volume control, either built into the amp, or in a junction box under the deck by the patio, in the house, wherever you want but you need volume control unless you want it to be controlled by source only. And no the Gain is not your volume control, thats how you kill speakers.  Youre also gonna need some good 2 conductor wire, but thats implied, and sold separately while supplies last."
hometheater,3a4ieq,dtrainescobar,1 point,Wed Jun 17 06:51:29 2015 UTC,"I'd actually like to have an amp and a volume control.  The goal is to be able to hook my phone up via bluetooth, and jam, but I'd also like to hear the TV (football in the fall), so I'd like something that I can hook my TV into as well.  Would this receiver work for what I'd like to do?  Also, what kind of volume control should I get? I'd like something where I can control all 4 speakers with just one knob."
hometheater,3a4ieq,dtrainescobar,2,Wed Jun 17 06:57:10 2015 UTC,"You dont need an AVR for this, thats for home theater. You simply need a 150-300watt per channel amp for your 35watt stable  speakers, theyre 6ohm speakers so you MUST have a 150 watt volume control for all 4 speakers to go on it. That vc's multiplier will probably need to be at 8x to be stable enough of a load on the amp.   If you want the amp to have inputs look for one with a digital toslink connection for the TV, and then you can use an RCA Y-Cable for connecting your phone to it or via bluetooth.   If you want to get that denon for the bluetooth and toslink you can, but its overkill."
hometheater,3a4ieq,dtrainescobar,1 point,Wed Jun 17 07:05:30 2015 UTC,Would you have any recommendations for me - amp wise?
hometheater,3a4ieq,dtrainescobar,2,Wed Jun 17 07:10:19 2015 UTC,"The only products I recommend, are only sold to AV installers unfortunately, so I dont have any suggestions at a consumer level, just base specs to suggest."
hometheater,3a4ieq,Armsc,1 point,Wed Jun 17 07:19:35 2015 UTC,"Reasonable. Alright, so this is my final dumb question. Probably. Eh, probably not. Anyway!  What should I type into the search bar Amazon/Best Buy/Guitar Center/whatever to narrow down my options?"
hometheater,3a4ieq,Armsc,2,Wed Jun 17 07:22:15 2015 UTC,"Try manufacturers like denon, yamaha, onkyo, klipsch, etc. Look for 150W 2D(2 zones or 2 channels), or 300W 2D. Thats 150 or 300W per channel. 150 should be fine for you, its about 70W for both speakers on the channel. A 300w would be great for future proofing your purchase if you get that itch to add speakers."
hometheater,3a4ieq,Meganormous,2,Wed Jun 17 07:28:11 2015 UTC,"It sounds to me like you were on the right track with the AVR.  Why don't you look at this Denon X1100 refurb for $250.  Run the assignable speaker outs to a speaker selector  for another $30 and you're in business.    Now you can connect the AVR to your home network and control it through your smart phone.  You can now control power, volume, sources, channels ect for both zones all while outside.  You also get the benefit of setting up a 5.1 in your living room or wherever you set up the AVR.    The only issue you have is running the wire outside and where to locate the speaker selector.  Why do you want 4 speakers?  If you went with just two you could eliminate the need of the speaker selector."
hometheater,3a4ieq,Bill_Money,1 point,Wed Jun 17 13:43:05 2015 UTC,Because it's two separate decks (one above the other) and I frequently have many people over on both of them. Would like to disperse sound evenly on the top and bottom deck.
hometheater,3a4ieq,Flipmer,1 point,Wed Jun 17 19:48:47 2015 UTC,"I'm with you now...no problem. Just get the speaker selector and add in the extra wire and you're in good shape.  I did something very close to this with my brother the other weekend.  It was pretty cool to be able to control everything from you phone while on the back patio.    FYI I would take Meganormous' suggestion about going bigger on the speakers to heart.  I've hooked up the Yamaha's that you're looking at and they do sound good.  However, the low end leaves a lot to be desired.  If you're going for ambient music with classical, folk, or instrumental then you're good.  If you're into hard rock, pop, dance, hip-hop/rap or anything with bass and/or like it on the louder side look for something with a larger driver. Here are some examples if you've not already bought the yamaha's you linked.     Yamaha NS-AW350 $100 OSD AP840 $150"
hometheater,3a3qai,squishy0071,3,Wed Jun 17 00:07:25 2015 UTC,Any mount rated for the weight of your television installed properly bolted to the studs would have no worries.

hometheater,3a4ael,MojoMercury,1 point,Wed Jun 17 13:08:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that makes sense. I guess I thought it diverted power, or something to that effect.  My main concern is a note in the T775 manual that says ""Never connect both the external amplifier and T 775's speaker outputs to the same set of speakers."" I'm not clear if they mean the same speaker terminals, or physically the same speaker box. Technically, the woofer and the tweeter has it's own set of terminals and aren't the same speaker."

hometheater,3a46e9,hkrob,2,Wed Jun 17 02:21:41 2015 UTC,Curious as to why you don't use HDMI for audio? Curious too about pairing up $3500-$4000 worth of speakers to a $500 max receiver. With your budget in mind I'd get this: http://www.accessories4less.com/make-a-store/item/marsr6008/marantz-sr6008-7.2-networking-a/v-receiver-w/airplay-w/3-yr-warranty/1.html

Any advantage to using HDMI for Audio vs SPDIF?  Thanks for the recommendation on the Marantz, certainly looks interesting.  Regarding the receiver budget, I'm curious as to whether I would really benefit much from a more expensive receiver, my speakers are good, but not that good... happy to be wrong here!"
hometheater,3a46e9,000Destruct0,2,Wed Jun 17 02:32:00 2015 UTC,"Well, I have a set of Martin Logan speakers that retailed for $2300 and my receiver retailed for $2000 when new. If it's a financial hardship I certainly don't recommend it but if you have the budget for it you get a better power supply, more powerful amps and typically more processing power for things like dolby/dts.  When dealing with receivers, you have to pay for the features you don't want to get the higher quality. I love my receiver (Marantz SR-7008) but I'd trade up to get an Anthem MRX-710 in a heartbeat. If you do not intend to upgrade soon for newer features then I recommend you buy the most receiver you can get today."

I never turned it up unless I saw the neighbor's car was gone (60's year old woman), and then not even very loud at all out of respect for the complex neighbors.  Turns out, she had a 20-something daughter who lived with her who almost never left the house so I didn't know anybody was there.  She was absolutely insane - once posting a note on my door claiming I was keeping her baby up (she didn't have a baby) and that their repeated attempts to tell me to turn it down (never happened) were being ignored and the cops would be called next time.  After the daughter's note, I completely unplugged the sub.  What the insane daughter didn't know was that I had a 5.1 Emotiva system, complete with 5x200w amp and 12"" sub, sitting in boxes in my closets, never opened (couldn't pass up a huge sale), out of respect for my neighbors.  I bought my own place two years ago, framed the note from the neighbor, hung it over the sub, and never looked back.  Wow, that ended up being a lot longer than I was expecting.

hometheater,39xzoh,Fourtytwoish,3,Tue Jun 16 20:39:28 2015 UTC,"In the beginning, yields (percentage that can be sold) were just 10%, meaning that only one in ten OLED displays could be sold to consumers. At the end of 2014, LG had improved yield for Full HD OLEDs to 80% and it is now “over 80%”. LG has previously said that OLED can compete with LCD on price when yield reaches 95%.  UHD OLED panels are still far more expensive because they are harder to produce. However, things are improving fast and LG reports that it has reached 65% yield. The goal is to reach 87%, 85% and 75% for 77"", 65"" and 55"" UHD OLED panels, respectively, by the end of the year. If everything goes according to plan, LG will double production and likely reduce prices. LG also plans to supply other manufacturers with OLED panels by the end of 2015.  quoted from: http://www.flatpanelshd.com/news.php?subaction=showfull&id=1434114302"

hometheater,3a08cf,turbosubaru,2,Tue Jun 16 12:49:55 2015 UTC,No but I'm a fan of Fluance and am familiar with their products. Their motto is literally bang for the buck. I seriously considered their xl7f towers when I was planning my system.  How's the price($475)?   Don't buy your speaker wire or cables at best buy. They are overpriced big time.   What do you need besides a 5.1 system-you only have the Sony avr currently?
hometheater,3a08cf,turbosubaru,1 point,Tue Jun 16 13:10:28 2015 UTC,"We were able to get an open box deal from Best Buy that was FAR below any price i saw on amazon or whatever.  We got the 850 for $100 off, just minus a remote, which I found online for $40.  We are going to upgrade to a new TV, currently we have a 42"" Sharp thats about 6-7 years old.  We just don't need much, I have a PS4, we watch movies, and we want to throw our music to the AV system because we have people over sometimes.  I just know almost nothing about speakers, i was suprised how i couldnt easily find out how to know what ""size"" speaker system my 850 could handle.

The P363 6.5"" towers regularly drop to $100 each on Amazon. I picked up a 10"" klipsch sub at a pawn shop for $90. And an older primus c25 center for $60 off eBay. My surrounds are from an older Monoprice 5.1 system I still have kicking around. That set goes on sale for <$200 fairly often and is a great starting point."
hometheater,3a08cf,000Destruct0,2,Tue Jun 16 13:19:29 2015 UTC,"I suppose it depends on how good you want your speakers to be. In a well balanced system the speakers, as a whole, will typically compromise about 60%-70% of the system cost. No matter how good the receiver or blu-ray player or even TV you'll end up replacing one or all of them while a good set of speakers can last a decade or more.  With that in mind, with  your budget I'd probably start with a very good pair of speakers and add to it as my budget permits. If, for any reason, this is a one time good deal then the Fluance system already recommended is about as good as your going to get."

I had won some best buy gift cards in a contest (long story) so I got my PS4 almost free.  We got an open box 850 from best buy (plus $40 for a controller I had to buy) for $325 plus tax.  I have around $400 to spend on speakers, but its not a hard number, so I would consider $50 more if its worth it."

hometheater,39xxad,soabirw,5,Mon Jun 15 18:20:50 2015 UTC,"You are going to need a receiver that has preouts for those channels. I am assuming if they advertise it is doable with an external amp the receiver in question will have the outputs. At that point all you need is to connect the amp, set the amps volume control to somewhere around 1/2 - 3/4 max and the receiver will then act as a preamp and send the appropriate volume level based on the recievers master volume and internal calibration.   As for what amp, really any two channel will do. Something from Emotiva or Outlaw should be affordable or you could go with a pro amp from crown or qsc, these may have louder fans but provide more power for your buck.   That linked setup will certainly work very well, but you could also probably do it for far less money"
hometheater,39xxad,davdev,1 point,Mon Jun 15 20:15:42 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the details.  That helps with my concerns quite a bit.  I think I'll go with a standard AVR + amp instead of the items I linked.  That way I can get the AVR that does 7.1.2 and get some of my speakers working and then later add in the amp for the other 2.  And some of the external amps I was looking at supported other inputs, such as USB/iPod, so I can still re-purpose it for Rifftrax or music.  The Yamaha setup I linked wouldn't allow that."
hometheater,39xxad,JulianoRamirez,1 point,Tue Jun 16 13:02:52 2015 UTC,"You should also make sure that the receiver can process enough channels, it may have the pre-outs but it doesn't mean it can output sound to all of them simultaneously. My Denon X4100w has 13 channel pre-outs, but can only process 9 channels at once. So I could have 5.1.4 or 7.1.2. Just something to watch out for."

hometheater,39x7tg,eddiefiguer,8,Mon Jun 15 15:18:05 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't do it. 4K from Netflix is going to be very compressed, so I'm not sure it would look much better than 1080p and I would guess not as good as a normal blu-ray, though that's just a guess. It is definitely not full uncompressed 4K though.  Future proofing a tv doesn't seem like a great idea though. We are still a ways away from regular, easy to access 4K content. In 2-3 or however many years before that's the case, you could put that $300 towards a tv with advanced technology that will be a lot better than a 4K vizio now. And you could probably get a bigger one.  A 55"" tv is also very small to take advantage of 4K. You have to sit within 8ft to notice any difference from 1080p. And that's with full 4K; compressed netflix would not look that good. And you have to sit around 3ft to get the full benefit of 4K from such a small tv.   I would stick with the 2014, which is a great 1080p tv for the price. I have a 60"". Save the $300, put it towards a speaker system, save it for a better 4K setup in the future, etc. Especially if you're happy with the tv you have now. I don't think spending an extra $300 would look much better, if it all, due to the small size and lack of good content."

hometheater,39x7tg,flashheatmvp3,3,Mon Jun 15 17:52:47 2015 UTC,"Ehhh, I'd say the biggest performance improvement from UHD is a wider color gamut and HDR the M series doesn't support either just the higher resolution which at 55"" might be pretty hard to see unless you are sitting really close.   Now if there are other improvements other than 4K that would make it worth a 50% price increase I kind of doubt it. Maybe it has a better smart TV or a little better contrast (heck it could be worse for all I know).  But right now is just not a great year for future proofing, the next year or two you could probably relatively easy but so much is transitioning right now you could very easily get left in the dust. 1080p is going to be around for a very long time."

hometheater,39wz6e,Armsc,1 point,Mon Jun 15 15:00:43 2015 UTC,"I've always heard very mixed reviews on the PSW10.  For your money you would better off with the Dayton Sub 800 for $115 or the Martin Logan Dynamo 300 for $130.  If you can stretch the budget, deal with the size and want better HT low extension the NXG-BAS-500 for $180 might be a good option.  I know there have been customer service issues posted on here but at $180 it's a real bargain for something that gets great reviews."

hometheater,39vicr,NewHamster,2,Mon Jun 15 04:06:57 2015 UTC,"Not OP, but a lot of television companies (Panasonic, Samsung etc) have pro lines.  They label them as pro, commercial, hospitality, etc.  They are not normally used in a residential consumer setting. They will have slots on the back of them to allow customization cards to be installed to meet the different needs of the commercial installation (maybe sorta like a PCI slot on a motherboard).  For example, ""hospitality"" televisions are often installed in hotel rooms and will have cards installed to integrate with a PPV system.  Pro displays also have other features like locking out control on the front panel buttons, locking out IR remotes, allowing rs-232 only, allowing IR port control (but not IR remote control) and other similar options to prevent ""customers"" from having fun with a tv that easily accessible .    You would control the panels using either a LAN network, RS-232, or even an IR remote.  Basically any method of control would just be based on the display having a static address, so your specifically hitting (controlling) just the display you want.  Even more basically, you tell the display where in a 3x3 matrix it is located and it is assigned an number.  The video walls I've dealt with will be daisy chained from one display to the next.  This means the display will have two ethernet ports so it can feed the next one and only one long cable will need to be ran to the headend for control.  Nowadays, the video will probably also be daisy chained (probably using display port).    At my work (a really big casino/resort), we mostly use NEC displays for our videos walls (Panasonics also used to be common, but not so much anymore for us at least).  Our hotel rooms are all Samsung Hospitality sets, but other manufacturers also have hospitality lines.    None of this is would probably be practical for a home theater setup though (but it's certainly not impossible).    Here is are a couple of links to pro display lines:  NEC  Panasonic  Here are the installation instructions for a NEC video wall setup (it's a PDF though, which I hope is alright to link to).

I saw Interstellar in a true film IMAX theater which had a whole host of issues -- most notably that the film itself must have not been flat in the projector as the right 20% of the image was pulsing in size ever so slightly. The theaters' HVAC system was also incredibly distracting every time it cycled on.  My home theater isn't perfect, but at least when something isn't to my liking I can fix it.

To others, it's all about the screen and getting the biggest picture you can in the space you have. Sometimes you'll even see great quality screens and set ups with tiny speakers and no subwoofer.  For me, it's finding the balance between both. I want to have the highest quality sound and picture for what I can afford.

The addition of a subwoofer can signal the beginning of the end for a living room.  Upping the screen size bigger than what your living room decor calls for begins to flirt into HT territory.  Introducing a projector to the mix and jumping way up in screen size really solidifies it and can be an instant living room killer.  Upping your speaker size so the sound impact matches the intensity of the size of your screen, thereby having big freaking speakers where tasteful lamps or paintings used to be.  Declaring the sun, the enemy of your contrast ratio, thereby turning your once light flowery inviting living room into a dark dank place of movie av worship.

Then you'll probably notice more clarity from the 4k, beyond 8ft both tvs will look similar.

It doesn't mean it's not a good solution for you personally, but just FYI - it doesn't fit into what this sub is all about. Please see the sidebar notes: Brand New to Audio? 99.9% of the time Soundbars or HTiB systems are not a good investment of your time and money. It is the general consensus of r/hometheater not to recommend these things and instead simply steer a user toward a 2.0 or 2.1 system made of quality, Audio-Centric name brand components easy to assemble and cheap enough for low budget or space conscious buyers. With that in mind, I would recommend finding a decent (could be used) 5.1 receiver and buy yourself a pair of speakers (shop used on Craigslist!) to start a 2.0 system. Then when you have another couple hundred bucks to invest, you can add a center channel and a sub to make a 3.1 system, and then later upgrade to 5.1."

I was able to pick up a Denon 1610 for $90 and a pair of Boston Acoustics CR8's for $50. The CR8's were considered great for $350, so getting that same sound for $50 was a great deal. They kick the shit out of typical budget speaker recommendations such as the Micca MB42x's and the Dayton B652's (I have used both in my own setup previously). Piecing together a setup over time with used equipment is hands down the best way to get quality equipment on a budget. I would also recommend browsing Accessories4Less to find a receiver. I purchased a refurbished Denon 1513 from there a year ago and have never had a problem with it. You can also get warranties unlike Craigslist. I would also go do a bit of reading on /r/zeos to learn some of the basics so you know what you're looking for."

There are two common types of 3D glasses today: passive and active shutter. Passive glasses are like the ones you get at the movie theater. They are just polarized lenses. Active shutter glasses use battery power to switch each lens open and closed, blocking the image from your left and right eyes in sync to create the 3D image.   Your projector seems to use active shutter glasses, which are often more expensive. Your homemade method, unfortunately, will not work."

Needing to occasionally switch which device is plugged in isn't ideal, but for a secondary TV it might be preferable to paying more.

Your place looks dope. Sub placement is not critical because sub bass is omnidirectional. Corner loading a sub gives more bass."

hometheater,39o9rq,jasopen,6,Sat Jun 13 05:10:38 2015 UTC,"""Lossless"" does NOT mean what you think that it means.  Lossless is only talking about compressing the file size. FLAC is a lossless codec, in that the output can be exactly recreated before and after compression. FLACs are about half the size of raw WAVs, but they contain the same information.  But this does not mean you have perfect sound (or image)! Or that ""lossless"" means there's nothing more out there. For example, you can have a really shitty, tiny microphone on a windy day and record to a WAV. That would be ""lossless"" even though you can only hear random wind noise. You can also listen to the lossless audio through blown/bad speakers.  The first half of what you said was right. 24/96 is as good as audio will get. If you record/mix the audio at 24/96 and compress it lossless (or send the raw WAV), there's nothing more that can be done to make the sound better from the distribution side. Now audiophiles will whip their dicks out and compare their speakers or amps or whatever, but there's nothing more that the producers can do.  Anyway, let's talk video for a second. They do have lossless video. In exactly the same way that they have lossless audio. You can shoot and view RAW video, just like you can record and playback WAV audio.  In fact, the analogy goes deeper. If you have really, really good equipment, you might be able to tell the difference between a FLAC and a high quality MP3 you carefully play the clips back to back. Now audiophiles (same dudes whipping out their dicks about their $2000 receiver that's supported by $5000 in amplifiers so that it ""doesn't have to do any heavy lifting"") and even for regular consumers, there's not really a drawback to using FLAC over 320 kbps mp3. The file size is bigger, but it's not a big deal. So maybe you can tell, maybe you can't, why not go with the FLAC?  Video file size is so big, you have to make real sacrifices no matter what you do. Either you are going to store the 3 TB for an uncompressed .RAW video file, or you're going to have to live with some loss in clarity from compression. Since people can't really tell the difference, except with good equipment, training/natural affinity, AND seeing the clips back to back, everyone, even the hardcore cinephiles, are going to go with the compressed video.  To answer OP's question: /u/jasopen got it right in that 24/96 is the max quality you can record. But that's not how sound has changed. In the same 10-15 years that we went from 480i to 1080p, HD channels now broadcast in 5 channel surround sound. And most all movies have full 5.1. It's just you NOTICED the change from 480i to 1080p and you DIDN'T notice the change from 2.0 to 5.1."
hometheater,39o9rq,Minus-Celsius,2,Sat Jun 13 14:51:11 2015 UTC,"Not sure if it was addressed elsewhere, but you can certainly record and playback audio at higher than 96KHz.  Most pro audio converters can go up to 192KHz, and I believe there were converters available at one point that could record up in the 300+KHz range.  Regarding improvements in audio, I'd certainly say multi-channel audio is where we're seeing the most improvements, with formats like Dolby Atmos and the like drastically improving listening experiences."

People will buy the overspecced mic because it has more numbers, same as they buy speakers that are linear out to 36 kHz.  For most humans even 24/48k is the most they can hear, but there's some evidence that some humans can hear higher."

hometheater,39o9rq,quesman1,1 point,Wed Jun 17 21:44:03 2015 UTC,"Sound is just pressure. Microphones work by measuring the pressure. The Hz is the sample rate, so a mic at 48 kHz measures the pressure 48000 times per second. And a 16 bit mic measures the sound to 16 bits (64000 measurement points).  There's a mathematical law that signals gain no additional resolution if you sample at more than 2x the frequency. So human hearing caps at around 22 khz, so a 44.1 khz sample rate gets all the human hearing range."
hometheater,39o9rq,Minus-Celsius,1 point,Thu Jun 18 00:51:54 2015 UTC,"I think you might be confusing microphones and converters.  Microphones traditionally do not have converters built-in, but some manufacturers have built in the functionality so you can connect a microphone directly to a computer via a USB cable.  The analog to digital (A/D) or digital to analog (D/A) converters are what utilize the bit-depths and sample-rates that are being discussed.  Your understanding of sample rates is correct, but just want to clarify that microphones do not measure pressure, but are transducers that convert the energy from pressure to electrical signals.  Regarding Bit Depth, my understanding is that the higher the bit-depth, the more dynamic range you have in the audio.  The general rule is for every 1 bit you get 6dB of dynamic range.  16-bits gives you 96dB of range, and 24-bit gives you 144 dB of range.  I'm not sure if the ""64,000 measurement points"" is the right way to describe the function of Bit Depth in audio recording.  Here's some more information about bit depth in audio.  Edit: Clarification of Bit Depth"
hometheater,39o9rq,_____--_____,1 point,Thu Jun 18 04:15:46 2015 UTC,"I don't think I am confusing the two, just describing it in a way that is easier to understand. Why bring up converters as another thing to understand? It is not necessary at all to understand sampling rates.  As for bit depth, one way to look at it is increasing signal over the noise floor. Describing that as increased resolution seems more intuitive to me.  But your description is off. Bit depth doesn't increase dynamic range, as you've pointed out yourself, the microphone is analog and that limits the signal. The ADC can't retroactively add in dynamic range. I think you are confusing signal to noise ratio with dynamic range."
hometheater,39o9rq,Minus-Celsius,1 point,Thu Jun 18 12:13:55 2015 UTC,"Just want to clarify that microphones do not have sample rates or bit depths, as they are analog and do not contain any digital electronics.  Some cheaper microphones that are geared towards podcasters may have a built-in converter, but those are the exception to the rule, and shouldn't be confused with the standard microphone definition.  Regarding Bit Depth, take a look at this explanation on head-fi.org.  Specifically this section:   To phrase this using audio terminology, each extra bit of data moves the noise floor down by 6dB (half). We can turn this around and say that each bit of data provides 6dB of dynamic range (*4). Therefore 16bit x 6db = 96dB. This 96dB figure defines the dynamic range of CD. (24bit x 6dB = 144dB).  So, 24bit does add more 'resolution' compared to 16bit but this added resolution doesn't mean higher quality, it just means we can encode a larger dynamic range. This is the misunderstanding made by many. There are no extra magical properties, nothing which the science does not understand or cannot measure. The only difference between 16bit and 24bit is 48dB of dynamic range (8bits x 6dB = 48dB) and nothing else. This is not a question for interpretation or opinion, it is the provable, undisputed logical mathematics which underpins the very existence of digital audio."
hometheater,39o9rq,_____--_____,0,Fri Jun 19 05:10:32 2015 UTC,"You and that person are confused what dynamic range means. It's a cool sounding phrase, but that doesn't mean you can throw it around to describe everything.  Increasing bit depth lowers the noise, those are different. One is very clear and obvious, the other is either wrong.  I don't know why you feel the need to explain which electronic device is responsible for digital conversion to someone who is just asking what sampling rate means. I think you're needlessly complicating it, especially when the other info you are presenting is just wrong."

hometheater,39o9rq,bawse1,3,Sat Jun 13 05:13:08 2015 UTC,Diminishing returns is probably the best answer but I'd like to add to that.  The advances in audio while changes have been there but is likely more difficult to notice due to the way our brains processes and stores what we hear vs what we see.    Eyes do not need to be trained to notice the extra visual detail the way audio does.  In fact most of the advances in audio is not so much in the higher quality of the source but in how it is processed and delivered.   The way you can hear discreet sounds from all directions when really coming froom one direction is one of them .

hometheater,39o9rq,Shurgosa,1 point,Sat Jun 13 18:30:02 2015 UTC,"There are a lot of reasons. But one of the big ones is because most advances in audio quality are very difficult to quantify in a simple, linear fashion. The only comparison to your video example in audio is for digital files - (e.g. 16/24 vs 24/192) but that hasn't been, nor will it be, the only way audio can improve.   In many cases the metrics used in marketing audio products have only a dubious connection to fidelity: I've heard dozens of amps rated below 40 wpc that sound better and indeed 'more powerful' than amps rated from 100 to 500 wpc. And there are so many aspects to reproducing audio that are developed and sold separately, compared to the more one-box"" nature of video- so if someone develops a definitively better method for manufacturing speaker drivers, there's no guarantee that better driver will wind up being used with a good crossover in a well-designed speaker, and if it does, still no guarantee that speaker will get exposure and recognition it deserves. But again assuming our better speaker gets over that hurdle, some people will buy it and use a crappy amp, or a bad source component, or just set them up poorly and never get the potential out of it. Some people will claim it's the best thing that ever happen and should become the new standard, but between the proprietary parts that can't be widely replicated and the arguments about whether or not it's any good at all, a new standard is practically guaranteed not to emerge."

In a SMALL percentage of subs the LEFT input is sometimes used if you want to bypass some/all of the controls on the subwoofer. The crossover control for example. Reasoning here is---your AVR will be handling all of the bass filtering upstream of the sub. So you either want to bypass the sub's crossover or set it to it highest setting so you don't have cascading crossovers."

hometheater,39obzo,homeboi808,1 point,Sun Jun 14 03:13:14 2015 UTC,"How big a TV is too big for a smallish room is the wrong questions. The right question should be ""how big a TV is too big for the distance I'll be viewing it at"". You get to a point where the TV is so big you're constantly moving your eyes quite considerably and maybe even having to move your head just to see the main action on the screen and at that point its too big. It gets more complicated as we all have different fields of vision, how much peripheral vision we have.   The easiest way to figure out the answer to your question is first work out the distance you'll be watching the TV from then to go to a store with all kinds of sizes of TV. Take a tape measure and a fold down chair. Measure your distance from the TV and place your chair then just watch the content being displayed. When its too big it'll only take a minute or so before you start feeling uncomfortable watching it."

hometheater,39mxtp,Thimbles,3,Fri Jun 12 21:51:53 2015 UTC,Connect your sources to the receiver via HDMI and then HDMI out to the TV. Often times optical out from a TV is stereo only.

hometheater,39lwk1,nathanb065,3,Fri Jun 12 17:43:00 2015 UTC,"I don't think that will work.  As far as I know, the high level outputs of the subwoofer only work if there is a high-level input.  The subwoofer cannot amplify external speakers, it can only pass through an already amplified signal from the speaker-level inputs.  So (if i'm right), here's what you can do:  3.5mm to RCA L/R from the computer to the amplifier.  2 sets of speaker wire (L&R) from amplifier to the subwoofer High-Level inputs.  1 set of speaker wire from High-Level Out L to left speaker.  1 set of speaker wire from High-Level Out R to right speaker.  The subwoofer's high-level inputs aren't actually drawing current from the amp, it merely ""reads"" the voltage and uses its own amplifier to power the sub.  This way your amp is still driving the speakers directly."

Without finding someone who has a set or a valid review I'd opt for the Fluance speakers as I know what they sound like. They are pretty good for the price and they have a lifetime warranty.
hometheater,39mqxc,rkik_dnec,2,Fri Jun 12 21:01:44 2015 UTC,Depends more on the  speaker. If it has a rear port it would inhibit port effectiveness. Using it only for surrounds though may not matter that much. If the speaker has a rear port plug it for wall mounting.

If you upgrade to bigger mains, you will probably want to upgrade your center speaker as well to something that matches sonically to your mains, preferrably from the same manufacturer/series."

hometheater,39l0au,Armsc,1 point,Fri Jun 12 16:22:40 2015 UTC,Those speakers are going to sound like crap without the sub to hold up the low end.  This will especially be apparent in a HT setup with lows are important to the overall experience.  With a budget of $100 you're going to have very limited options.  I would consider getting another set of speakers for your computer and use the 4.1 set for your HT or just another set for the HT.  Another option would be to look into a soundbar...yep I said it.  Unless you're willing to up the budget these are your only options that I see.   The soundbar option will at least get you a remote to control the volume on your system which to me is a big plus.
hometheater,39hf9e,izwizard,2,Thu Jun 11 19:02:42 2015 UTC,"This review bothers me because there's no mention of the JS9000, and only mentions the JS9500. It also doesn't mention the OneConnect Mini - which is what the JS8500 has. I've been looking for a new TV for myself (as well as my parents and girlfriend) and I've given them both a thought.  The upgrade to the JS9000 is not prohibitively expensive. Example being you are looking at the 55"" JS8500 for the same price (at least right now) you could get the 48"" JS9000. I know the loss of 7 inches is a lot but it might be worth it if you were interested in staying upgradable for HDR with the connect one box on the JS9000 vs the connect one mini on the JS8500.  I think thats a significant thing to have to consider and also important facts to be left out of the review. I don't know everything about these TVs but would consider these big gaps in the review."
hometheater,39hf9e,SOG_,3,Thu Jun 11 20:34:04 2015 UTC,"Yes. I too wish it was more complete.  What I really would like to see is a list of all TVs that are HDR upgradable, have quantum dots, and 4:4:4: chroma, for computer monitors.   Then it seems it would be truly future proof for the next 5 years or so, which i guess is what samsung is trying to do with the replaceable  connect one interface."
hometheater,39hf9e,Scratchums,2,Thu Jun 11 21:31:52 2015 UTC,"Samsung's JS8500, JS9000, and JS9500 are all HDR ready.  I'm not 100% sure about the JS9100 that's just now coming out a bit later, but I'd assume it, as well.  Also, Sony's 930C models and above I know for certain are HDR ready.  As for 4:4:4 Chroma, that selection with regards to TVs is a bit wider. I'll compile a list:  1) LG - UB8500 or higher  2) Samsung - All 4K sets, which starts at J6500, when set to PC input and ""UHD Color"" is enabled  3) Panasonic - 600 model or higher, I believe only the larger sizes, though  4) Sharp - UD27 I can promise you, and it's likely that their new, smaller 4Ks as well.

hometheater,39hf9e,Scratchums,1 point,Fri Jun 12 21:26:39 2015 UTC,"According to this article, the entire SUHD line (8500, 9000, 9100, and 9500) is HDR capable, so I suppose that settles it for the JS9100 as well."
hometheater,39hf9e,Astroturfer,2,Fri Jun 12 22:34:34 2015 UTC,"just found this info.  I think it true:   All Samsung SUHD 4K TVs are HDR Ready and have a 10-Bit panel display. However the JS9500 will have superior HDR capabilities due to extra features like Full Array Local Dimming (FALD) that can produce deeper black color and much brighter contrast. Also the Led's on the JS9500 can reach 1000nit of light peak output compare to the 600nit of the JS9000 & 8500. Anyway the JS8500 will handle HDR content just fine and combine with the nano crystal display you should see a major improvement in picture quality far from any current 8-bit 4K TV out there. But if you are a true videophile enthusiast, the JS9500 has the leading edge in this feature. Let's hope those 4K Blu Ray players come out soon."

For one, you said you're in a small space. Because the benefits then would only be to bass extension (because you presumably don't need the extra output), I'd rather buy bigger and/or more subwoofers than towers. Bookshelves are likely to give better performance for the money even with the extra cost of subs, and you often have more freedom to move bookshelves around than towers.  Towers are only better under some circumstances, e.g. your wife won't let you put in the subs that would make bookshelves work, or you need more output (but even then there are better options and more issues to take into account)"

With Panasonic gone there are very few quality plasma makers out there anymore.  You're going to be looking at either Samsung or LG.  Also image retention on plasma screens can still happen.  It's not permanent but just annoying when it does.  I bought the last of the Panasonic plasma screens (ST60) when I'd heard they were cutting production, and do game on it regularly.

No return because they reserve the right to change features without notice - the LAST Samsung purchase I'll ever make.

The small amp's don't seem to ever have phono, and while the receivers do, they are pushing my budget and not leaving much room for the speakers. Anything close to or less than $200 would be ideal, and stereo is fine. While 5.1 would be nice, it could be years before i upgrade to surround sound.  On the topic of speakers, how would you recommend I split the budget between the speakers and sub. Should it be 50/50, or do I assume correct in that the speakers should come first."
hometheater,39exql,ArcamFMJ,1 point,Thu Jun 11 15:04:59 2015 UTC,"That's not an easy feat for less than 500 :)  You could begin by this receiver (not HC but has a tuner) which still has a phono input.  Or second hand! Audiophile are crazy people, they change gear all the time. You'll find a decent mid-range Denon HC amp with a good version of Audyssey for that sort of money. Last year I sold for 500 a monster amp (3000 new) that I bought used for 800 and kept 3 years.  As for your question about speakers, it really depends on your personal preferences and choice of music. If deep, tuneful bass makes you really happy go for a decent sub (nothing under 200-250 I'm afraid). If you have more pleasure from articulate and believable voices, being able to discern sounds in well known tunes you never knew where there etc, then avoid the sub altogether and go for the best standmount possible (add sub later when funds allow)."

If you are seriously considering the NXG subwoofer you better get over to Newegg and get it now, it's discontinued and they are selling out their stock at $180 each.   Of the speakers you've listed I would prefer the Chane speakers. The Deftechs are nice but the Chanes are like the Toyota version of my Martin Logans. If you go bookshelf speakers the Chane A1rx-c is a great choice and I think you are under estimating their ability to reproduce bass."
hometheater,39dcbf,000Destruct0,1 point,Thu Jun 11 02:00:22 2015 UTC,Thanks for the input. Do you think the NXG sub would be worth buying with a Chane setup? Would you recommend going with all bookshelf speakers rather than using towers for the fronts?
hometheater,39dcbf,000Destruct0,3,Thu Jun 11 02:52:18 2015 UTC,"In my own situation I found the Martin Logan towers have a better midrange than the bookshelf speakers which ended up sound just a bit thin but still very, very good. As for the NXG, it's a good sub but if you can afford it get the Hsu STF-2. It's not an orphan and even if they discontinued it you'd get better support from them. If you cannot afford it the NXG for $180 is quite the bargain even if it fails and you have to fix it yourself.  If buying towers means losing the center channel (or downgrading the sub) then I'd get the bookshelf speakers. I've heard the A1 and it's nothing short of astonishingly good. Three of those ($450 plus shipping) and the STF-2 and you'd have the foundation of a speaker system that would last as long as you want it to.   Yes, the towers would be nicer but your budget is always going to factor in. Speaking of which, what is your speaker budget?"

I figured that an extra $100 would be better put toward the other speakers. My budget for the audio system including receiver is $1500 so ~$1200 for speakers. I'm planning to upgrade the system in the next year or 2 to 5.1 or 7.1, so bookshelf speakers definitely wouldn't be a waste. If towers+center+sub would make a significant difference, I'd have to think about it before spending the extra $300 (assuming I'd get the STF-2). If I were to go with the Deftechs, that'd be a lot closer because of shipping."

hometheater,39bt1h,mpelleg459,1 point,Thu Jun 11 00:00:11 2015 UTC,"I had this same set up for over a year.  Nice system if the room isn't huge/open, and very high WAF for the sound/budget.  I do wish I had gotten the Procter 2000 instead of the 1000, as (counterintuitively) the PC1000 matches the PM800s and the PC2000 matches the PM1000.  Bajawaverrunner is basically deftech's refurb dealer on eBay if you wanted to replace any pieces down the road.  Just be aware that while the ProCinema speakers are pretty impressive for their budget, the laws of physics are immutable, and theres on so much bass that can be wrung from cabinets of a given size.  Also, Def Tech HUGELY inflates their specs (do some research on third party measurements/test bench numbers of their speakers).  Also, the craigslist link doesn't specify the sub, but I assume it is the ProSub 1000, which I still use.  Doesn't dig super deep, but round out the low miss and high-lows decently on the system.  For $350, that's a good deal; I got more than that when I sold just my LCR speakers."
hometheater,39bt1h,000Destruct0,1 point,Thu Jun 11 16:50:41 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the tips. Wife doesn't want towers and really neither do I. She was asking for some in wall speakers but I think some bookshelfs will be ok. It is a new construction two story condo so we will have people below us. I say new construction because they do seem to have some decent sound control measures for each floor so hopefully I can play something at a nice volume.  The person is not giving a subwoofer, so it is $350 for a 5.0 system. I definitely could upgrade the center to a 2000 later as I sell the existing 1000 center.  I still think its a good deal even without a sub because looking at used prices on Amazon and the shop you mentioned the equivalent is   ProCinema 800 Rear Satellites : $90 * 2 = $180 ProCinema 1000 Front LR : $130 * 2 = $260 ProCinema 1000 Center : $143   So about $580 for an equivalent on ebay and he is selling for $350. Pretty decent I think.  What do you recommend for a sub? Do you think I should stick with DT? I was leaning towards the Bic F12.  $200 for Bic F12 is probably all I want to spend because I don't need anything wall shaking because of neighbors. I have a thread here asking about this Martin Logan http://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B004LRPXAU but I was advised to go for a 12"" and just keep the volume down."

No, don't go def tech for the sub unless you can get one really cheap on the used market; no advantage to brand matching.  The Bic F12 is the consensus budget sub pick, but ML is the only other i see recommended frequently and enthusiastically.    The 5.0 is still a good deal.

The ProSub 1000 has been #1 on my upgrade list for a while.    Since you link to the wirecutter, I actually wound up getting the NHT absolute towers and a TwoC center (better than the absolute center that come packaged with the ATs) at a really good price and I'm much happier, but my space is pretty open, and I couldn't really do optimal placement with the PM1000s up front.    There's huge thread for Def tech ProCinema owners over at AVS forums, though it went from really active to basically dead a few months ago for some reason, it looks like."

hometheater,39b55w,bkedelen,2,Wed Jun 10 16:53:54 2015 UTC,"I'd still prefer the other two. My prime reason for that is they both include Audyssey MultEQ XT32 auto room calibration. The 3100 is a very nice receiver but only has MultEQ XT, the next step down which is a rather big step down."

I may not be up on Denon's current models, but back in the day when I got a TX-SR875 (an old warhorse with 140wpc), Denon's receiver at the same price point was something like 95wpc, and they were getting a ton of shit for it from the community.  I can imagine that Denon was probably just more honest about their specs than Onkyo at that time, but for some reason I have a lasting impression that Denon receivers cost a lot and the big difference is the word Denon on the front."
hometheater,39b55w,bkedelen,1 point,Wed Jun 10 18:33:47 2015 UTC,"By price Denon, Yamaha, Onkyo, and Pioneer are all in the same class. Onkyo Integra and Marantz are a slight step up. Then you move into the more boutique brands like Cambridge Audio, Anthem, Arcam and the like."
hometheater,39b55w,SirMaster,1 point,Wed Jun 10 18:41:37 2015 UTC,"That is pretty close to my understanding.  What concerns me is value rather than price, as I will pay a lot more to get a lot more.  Luckily for consumers lately, there isn't much more to get unless you are falling for something.  Most of the latest product trends are nearly useless (Atmos, Auro-3D, xx.y where x>7|y>2, 4k, 3d, app stores, voice control, network streaming, etc.)  I tend to think of Onkyo, Integra, and Marantz as the best value, Emotiva, Outlaw, NAD, Denon, Yamaha, and Pioneer as the next best value, then the ridiculously overpriced boutique stuff at the bottom end.  That stuff may be good or even great, but it can never be cost effective for a working stiff."
hometheater,39b55w,000Destruct0,0,Wed Jun 10 18:54:04 2015 UTC,Except refurbished means it had a problem they had to fix.  And there is a chance that there was some underlying problem that could cause it to break again in the same way.
hometheater,39b55w,SirMaster,1 point,Wed Jun 10 17:17:58 2015 UTC,There is a chance that anything you purchase will break as perfection has yet to be achieved.   Whether a refurbished unit fails again in the same manner would depend on two things - if it's a fundamental design flaw it won't matter if it's new or refurbished.  If it's due to something else (say a failed resistor allowing excess current to a part causing it to fail it will depend on how thorough the refurbishing process is.   Either way it's warranted so I'm not sure what your point is.
hometheater,39b55w,000Destruct0,0,Wed Jun 10 17:25:50 2015 UTC,"My point is I don't see how you can make a claim that   ""theoretically a refurbished receiver should be more reliable than a brand new one""   I just don't see the proof to that.  At least not overall and in general."
hometheater,39b55w,SirMaster,1 point,Wed Jun 10 17:29:45 2015 UTC,"Not much on analytical thinking then are you? Is there a chance an underlying issue caused the failure (assuming there even was a failure to begin with?) Sure, would it be statistically significant? Not likely.  Most failures in electronic devices can be traced back to either infant mortality in chips/components or faulty soldering joints. If the failed components are from a batch of faulty parts then all devices made from that batch will fail regardless whether it's new or refurbished.  If not then the likelihood of the exact same part or solder joint failing are pretty small.   As most devices today are under or marginally engineered (as opposed to the over engineered products of the past) they are typically operating at the limit of their capability so design failures tend to show up rather quickly as do bad parts.   Now that you want to debate this tell me, how many refurbished items have you encountered that failed again due to an underlying issue that was not a design flaw??"
hometheater,39b55w,000Destruct0,-1,Wed Jun 10 17:46:46 2015 UTC,"I used to recommend A4L products to my friends.  My cousin bought a Denon from them and so did my uncle.  Both of them had their receivers fail around the 1 year mark.  They had intermittent issues with their receivers just locking up and powering off randomly.  I don't see why it's not possible that they were seeing the same failures that causes these receivers to be refurbished in the first place.  Or how you can prove that the failures they saw were not caused by this.  Both of the Denon receivers I purchased new are still working today.  So 2/2 new are working and 0/2 refurbished are working.  Not a big sample size, but how big of a sample size can one individual person have on a product like this?  I'm sure you could find a person in the opposite case to me.  But then the data would look inconclusive and that is still not sufficient to make a claim that refurbished should be more reliable than new.  You could probably say refurbished is not less reliable though."
hometheater,39b55w,SirMaster,2,Wed Jun 10 17:54:08 2015 UTC,"You could probably say refurbished is not less reliable though.   Mass produced electronics gear does not go through any sort of testings procedure other than it might be plugged in and turned on before it's boxed up. A refurbished device has been through repeated thermal cycles and operational testing giving any marginal parts repeated opportunities to fail.   I don't see why it's not possible that they were seeing the same failures that causes these receivers to be refurbished in the first place.   You do realize that there is no requirement that a refurbished product must be one that has failed right? A refurbished product can be one that was a demo at a trade show, it can be one returned because the end user couldn't understand it and returned it. It could be one that was returned by someone stating it was bad but was actually a case of buyer's remorse. There are any number of reasons a product ends up refurbished and broken is not the only one even if it is the predominant one.   Both of them had their receivers fail around the 1 year mark. They had intermittent issues with their receivers just locking up and powering off randomly.  Both of the Denon receivers I purchased new are still working today.   So then you base your entire argument off anecdotal evidence.  I can only assume you (bought 2 for whatever reason), your uncle and your cousin all bought the exact same model of receiver otherwise even your anecdotal evidence is fundamentally flawed.  Having worked as a repair technician for a major electronics manufacturer I'll rely on more statistically valid evidence."

I can only assume you (bought 2 for whatever reason), your uncle and your cousin all bought the exact same model of receiver otherwise even your anecdotal evidence is fundamentally flawed.   No.  One bought a $250 model, a 1712 I believe and one bought a $600 model, a X3000 I believe.  I bought 2 because I bought a 1910 years ago and a 2112CI after that to replace it and repurpose the 1910.  But what you said in your long post in my experience does not apply to every company.  Unless you can provide evidence that the company in question here (Denon) does not perform thorough QA testing on new units and that they perform more thorough QA testing on refurbished units."

Yes the Onkyo's have had HDMI issues but if he's already replace the board an you keep it well vented you should be fine. I'm using an 807 currently and sent it in when I got it to fix the HDMI for like $250?  I would consider an Onkyo or Integra to replace it but they dropped audyssey support in last year so that would push me to look at marantz as far as new gear goes.

hometheater,39b55w,portezbie,1 point,Wed Jun 10 19:42:43 2015 UTC,"Because people want the most they can get for their gear. Problem is the HDMI is only 1.3 (I think) in those and I don't think it will pass 3D. Which is fine if you're only concerned with 1080p content and a 5.1 or 7.1 configuration.  If you can afford the $350 ok, but I wouldn't pay more than $300, especially if the HDMI boar hasn't been replaced yet as that repair would set you back another 2-250 bringing the total cost of the gear to ~$500 and at that point you could start looking at new gear.  It's up to you and if you're willing to spend the dough."

hometheater,39b55w,Joncat84,1 point,Wed Jun 10 20:22:37 2015 UTC,"If the board hasn't already failed and been replaced I wouldn't be surprised if it did eventually fail. It's an odd failure that ha to do with the chips getting too hot and the pins coming slightly un soldered making a weak connection. Many units will show the tell tale symptom of turning on and passing video but not giving a second ""click"" to engage the amp and can take progressively longer to ""warm up"" and engage the amplifier and eventually the connection will be too weak to trigger the amp leaving you with no sound.  It's not guaranteed to fail, but is likely."

hometheater,39ae27,ghostBrazen,6,Wed Jun 10 12:04:51 2015 UTC,"Because 99% of the ebay ones are NOT HD.  To truly be HD you need a native resolution to be at HD dimensions (whether it be 720 or 1080).    They all say ""HD Compatible"" or ""HD Ready"" ... this just means they can take an HD signal and turn it to shit... not a very impressive task  The two you linked:    Native Resolution:   WXGA (1280x800)    Native resolution: 800x480     Woot yesterday had a Optoma 1080p, 3d, 300 lumen project for $499 (refurb'd) .... that would have done well, but it has since come and gone.  Keep your eyes on Woot, they have refurb'd nice projectors quite often, and the refurb'd ones generally have longer warranties so you should be okay.  EDIT - woot's was the same that /u/MudMan69 linked on Amazon.  That will be worth every penny of the $5XX compared to the generic ebay ones.  Keep an eye on craigslist too, I bought a Epson 8350 + mount + screen + 2 extra bulbs for $600 not too long ago."
hometheater,39ae27,Sidekicknicholas,4,Wed Jun 10 15:07:10 2015 UTC,"For starters, there doesn't even seem to be a brand on the unit itself.  Probably more importantly is the native resolution on both of them (1280x800 and 800x480).  The second one is definitely not HD if it can only do 480p, so I'll stop talking about that one.  Other things that strike me as odd are the manual that appears to be in Chinese, the keystone correction seems to be a knob on the unit, there seem to be a number of spelling/grammatical errors, and two different remotes shown in the pictures.  All around, these strike me as something that might work alright for 6-12 months, but God help you if ever have a problem with it. The reviews on Amazon for a similar projector seem to reflect these thoughts: http://www.amazon.com/Multimedia-lumen-Projector-Native-Contrast/dp/B00CPV2TM4   There are plenty of good projectors under $1,000 though.  They will be 1080p, they may have real lens shift instead of keystone correction, they'll have a manufacturer with a warranty they stand behind, and they'll have extensive knowledge bases online."

Here's a much better 1080P projector that isn't too far from your price point."
hometheater,39ae27,MudMan69,2,Wed Jun 10 14:48:10 2015 UTC,Just because something can out out 720p lines of res doesnt mean it does anything else well.   For your budget go to visual apex and look for the Epson 8345-r. It should be right in your 500 range and then lens shift will give you more placement options since you arent using a fixed setup

hometheater,39dm8z,CoveredInKSauce,1 point,Thu Jun 11 01:29:39 2015 UTC,"I just wanted to make sure this wouldn't cause any issues with the sound.   Oh no, it absolutely will ""cause issues with the sound"" because the majority of speakers are not made with flush mounting in mind. This will ""boost"" a wide range of frequencies and you'll no longer have the planned frequency response. With that said, if you were just going to put them against a wall instead of doing a more ideal setup of putting them out into the room then sound quality isn't your #1 goal and the difference won't be so major to you."
hometheater,39dm8z,awgoody,1 point,Thu Jun 11 01:39:58 2015 UTC,"I guess what I'm trying to say, is will it be alright to set on a shelf basically? and how much wiggle room do I have for the gap around the speaker?  should I increase it to more like 6 inches?"
hometheater,39dm8z,awgoody,1 point,Thu Jun 11 01:42:44 2015 UTC,"should I increase it to more like 6 inches?   That won't make any difference.  To (try) and put it simply, lower frequencies sounds have a longer (think of it as larger) wavelength than higher ones. These ""larger"" ones essentially ""wrap"" around your speaker and bounce off the back wall when you play music. This is in contrast to higher (think ""smaller) sounds, which are ""contained"" by the speaker and do not wrap around - they simply go forward.   When you move your speakers away from the wall (the ideal), this bounce (called a reflection) comes later in time than if you were to have the speakers close to the back wall. Because volume degrades over distance, the longer it has to travel, the quieter this bounce will be.   Speaker designers keep this in mind when designing their speakers, so if you put the speakers closer to a rear wall than the designer expected, then those frequencies will be louder than they planned for.   This alters the sound of the speaker as to ""boost"" lower frequencies more than they should be.   The reason that leaving a few inches around them won't make a difference is because these frequencies are way larger than that. We're measuring in feet or yards - not a few inches.  How do we limit this? Consider looking for speakers made to be flush mounted, such as those made for in-wall installations. I do not have any specific recommendations for you (nor do I know your budget), so I might suggest reading some reviews. You might also want to consider pro monitors that allow you to turn down the bass, but these are really only practical in certain circumstances (e.g. 2 channel with no traditional receiver).  EDIT - just to clarify, the effects are only related to audio quality. They're not about to overheat or anything."

Maybe the ultimate takeaway is that with your space limitations you're never going to have great audio. So I might live with that limitation and 1) not pour a ton of money into speakers; and 2) realize that upgrades won't be worthwhile until you can get your speakers in a better position away from the walls.   I forgot to mention that buying a receiver with audyssey or equivalent room correction software will help a good bit, but I still think my advice above applies."

I'd agree that it seems like they're only using the centre conductor.  How easy do you think it would be to wire the wall panel to have the pos/neg connected correctly to just 2 RCA ports?  Perhaps it would be easier to put in a pair of 5 way binding post as PaeTar suggests.  I will take the wall plate off on the weekend to get a better idea of what we're dealing with.
hometheater,39a7uj,pcdude99,1 point,Wed Jun 10 21:00:40 2015 UTC,"One cheap and dirty approach would be to simply get a couple of low cost RCA to RCA audio cables and cut one end off of each, strip the center conductor back and connect that to the amp, while you connect the other end to the wall plate.  For a short run this shouldn't be too bad."
hometheater,39a7uj,PaeTar,1 point,Wed Jun 10 21:08:22 2015 UTC,"I suppose it would be easier to play by the rules established by the idiot that wired the speakers. Dirty, yes. Cheap, yes. Could be cleaner but that would involve messing around behind the wall plate.  Or I might just get 4 of these and connect them to speaker wire. http://www.jaycar.com.au/Interconnect/Plugs%2C-Sockets-%26-Adaptors/RCA/Crimpless-RCA-Plug---Blue/p/PP0208"

Take the $350 of the highest price option and do this instead, get a pair of these: http://www.wavecrestaudio.com/products/hvl-1-two-way-loudspeaker-pair  And get this subwoofer: http://smile.amazon.com/MartinLogan-Dynamo-300-Theater-Subwoofer/dp/B004LRPXAU/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1433966659&sr=8-1&keywords=dynamo+300  As your budget recovers get a single Wavecrest for the center channel then maybe a pair of Dayton Audio B652 AIR speakers ($66 a pair) for surrounds.

hometheater,39c2q0,Ausdauer,1 point,Thu Jun 11 13:03:55 2015 UTC,"I am not overly impressed with the Andrew Jones Pioneer speakers so I may not be the best one to ask. That being said, were I buying I'd opt for the Fluance set simply because it has a far superior subwoofer and my expectation would be that regardless of which set I bought that I'd likely be upgrading it piecemeal and the Fluance sub I could stay with.  My personal impression of the AJ Pioneers is that they tend to sound a bit dull and lifeless. They are well made for what they cost. Recommend you listen to a set if you have a Best Buy close to you and see how you like them.   FWIW, Fluance is now what Polk used to be - a company that buys quality stock drivers and crossovers and builds well made, economical cabinets and sells direct at a very good price."

hometheater,398rwn,Deadleggg,1 point,Thu Jun 11 14:05:07 2015 UTC,"Depends on the unit. On my receiver (Marantz SR-7008) the receiver treats each sub as a separate unit. As for Atmos, it can be great but you need to get a higher end receiver as it requires quite a bit of processing power and a suitable room."
hometheater,398rwn,000Destruct0,1 point,Wed Jun 10 12:02:30 2015 UTC,"really? how did you determine that?  and i know atmos is nice if you have a large room and proper amplification/power and an actual atmos source. but think of the people on this sub. most of them ask for 5.1 on a sub 500 dollar budget, AVR included. so for the time being im leaning towards atmos being a crock.  at least once we have more atmos specific sources i'd be ok with saying atmos is worth the effort to put in and set up in a dedicated area."
hometheater,398rwn,ss0889,1 point,Wed Jun 10 13:36:04 2015 UTC,really? how did you determine that?   There are a few individuals who sell Marantz on the AVS forums and have a line to the manufacturer. They confirmed it for the 7008 and 7009 receivers. I think it's also true of the Denon X4000 and up series. Cannot say one way or the other for Pioneer and Yamaha.  I no longer bother with Onkyo.

hometheater,398rwn,ss0889,1 point,Wed Jun 10 13:56:13 2015 UTC,"When it comes to making a recommendation I don't bother with that, but reliability is #1 on the list. Doesn't matter how good it may sound or how many whiz bang features it  has if it's going to break early and often. That being said, I do love the styling of my Marantz."
hometheater,398rwn,000Destruct0,1 point,Wed Jun 10 14:07:15 2015 UTC,"yup, im a big fan of how the marantz looks and how pioneer looks. i dont concern myself with it too much either but if its going to take up a majority of my AV system and be one of the biggest eye catching things in the system, i need it to look good.  but first and foremost i look for preamp outputs for all channels. usually that one feature by itself is a great indicator of overall quality. multichannel inputs? now we're golden. multi-zone HDMI would be great too. not like input 1 goes to both outputs 1 and 2 at the same time, but more like input 1 goes to output 1 or 2, and input 2 goes to the other output.  And one thing i really really fucking hate about this receiver: digital input cannot be used as an output for anything except amp and preamp. i think i have a media player input and a media player output. at one time, i really wanted to have TV going out of zone 1 and my PC coming out of zone 2, but there is apparently only 1 DAC allowed operational at a time, and that media player output can only be used from an analog input source."
hometheater,398rwn,ss0889,2,Wed Jun 10 15:32:23 2015 UTC,I personally don't place a lot of emphasis on that as my system is very simple and I care nothing for multiple zones as I prefer separate systems for different rooms.

Perhaps someone trading in a phone at T-Mobile.  Do a quick google search for those having an issue with Paypal. You may also be interested in hearing about the experiences that small time sellers have had with ebay and Amazon.  I won't (and don't) defend NXG for shoddy service but I also live in the real world so I understand that their customer service is not, unfortunately, the exception and presenting it as though it is is at best a misrepresentation."

It's a great deal for high performing sub recommended by great contributors like yourself. (Seriously, I and others have used your advice many times over) But, more information is better imo. And it may be useful to someone to know they may have quality issues, have limited customer support, have to fork over $ for shipping, and be without a unit for weeks. Then they are prepared for it. I speak from experience. I have had 3 bad units from 2 different brands. Not fun and that was with good customer service."
hometheater,396p3x,000Destruct0,2,Wed Jun 10 01:46:53 2015 UTC,"Telling people not to buy it is not the proper way to proceed though. Telling people that their customer service leaves a lot to be desired so be prepared should you have an issue - that I can understand.   I have had several really trying issues with T-Mobile but I don't go around telling people not to use them because I understand how the real world works.   At this point it is moot as you are buying an orphan. All things considered, at $180 even if it failed on me I'd just buy another amp and I'd still come out ahead."

When I hooked it back up, it completely did not work. No power or anything at all. So that's when the fun began. NXG has no available phone number at all. So I sent them an email telling them what happened and asked what the return process was so I could ship it to get it fixed.  Well after two weeks and two diff emails, I still didn't have a response. So I emailed amazon and told them what happened. Literally the next day, NXG responed to my previous emails with instruction on how to send it back. So its not like they didnt get my other emails.. Luckily I kept the box it came in, and it costed me $60 to ship the sub back to them. So now I'm in the whole $320 and haven't had a sub for over three weeks.  I emailed them after a week and a half asking them if they received my sub and if it was covered under the warranty. I got zero response for over a month from them. I sent them two more emails asking them what the deal was and I still didn't even know if they got the sub. So I'm all worried that my $300 sub got sent to the wrong place and still didn't know if it was covered by the warranty. So I emailed amazon again and the next day I got a really nasty, sarcastic, and extremely unprofessional email from NXG stating that they did get my sub and they would send me a new one. Basically they told me that if I wanted faster service, that I should have bought from a company that had ""just extra sub's laying around in there wearhouse that could be shipped.""   That really turned me off and the complete lack of communication or even a hint or customer service for my inconvenience pissed me off. They basically told me that if I want a better experience to go with a better company. So that's why I'm telling people to not deal with these jerks. Get the bic and save urself some hastle. It took over three months to get my new sub back from them and they treated me like shit.  If it wasn't for amazon riding them, I'm pretty sure I would have never gotten my sub back and I still havent a clue what went wrong with it in the first place."

I bought the F12 next, thinking I could get dual subs going. It was not happening. They were so different. Granted the F12 is quite a bit more powerful than the Monoprice, but even at low volumes, I had a hard time getting them to sound like anything worth listening to. Then, of course, the more you turn up the volume, the bigger the difference in sound.  The Bic and the NXG are much closer in power (supposedly) so maybe you will get better results than I did.   Truthfully though, if I hadn't bought a pair of speakers two weeks ago, I would probably jump on this deal regardless of my previous experience. Try and remember to let me (or us) know how the two subs work for you...good luck!"

hometheater,396p3x,Armsc,1 point,Wed Jun 10 16:09:26 2015 UTC,The way I see it is if you're in the market for a new/better sub why not give this guy a try?  Use it till it the amp goes out (it sounds like it will sooner than later) then either replace the plate or just make it passive and get an external amp.  The reviews are very positive for this unit so even if you have to replace the amp you should still be right about $400 out of pocket which is not bad for a solid performing sub.

What I am looking for is for sure quality but for a more modest price. 400 is in the range of me spending for a good receiver. I like to have it more volume.

hometheater,397n58,Munstered,3,Tue Jun 9 21:04:36 2015 UTC,Sony xbr65x850. I love love my Samsung plasma to death but Sony has everything going for them with 4k technology. But the 850 for the triluminos panel is much better than the 800. Don't buy Vizio. They are cheap size not high quality. I know it's a bit out of your price range but if you can wait you can find last years model around 2k and the new one will eventually sell sub 2k just not sure how long you'll have to wait. If you can't wait get the Samsung for sure
hometheater,397n58,jrussell90,2,Wed Jun 10 02:11:33 2015 UTC,Only issue is that the 850 series doesn't have HDR. It has TRILUMINOS but that isn't the same. So this TV isn't a full 4k spec TV and not exactly future-proof for the time period you looking for.
hometheater,397n58,whoinow,1 point,Wed Jun 10 07:19:37 2015 UTC,I'm confused by your comment. The xbr65x850c I'm looking at is advertised as 4K and lists 3840 x 2160 pixels. Could you explain what you mean by your comment that it's not a full 4k spec TV? Thanks!
hometheater,397n58,whoinow,1 point,Wed Jun 10 19:51:52 2015 UTC,"4k or UHD isn't just a resolution. It also comes with new DRM (HDCP 2.2) and HDR. If a device doesn't support HDMI 2.0 (18gbps+) w/HDCP 2.2, 4:4:4 chroma, MUCH higher contrast and 4k resolution, then don't buy it.  edit: It looks like HDMI 2.0a spec has just been announced for full HDR over HDMI. This is just another example on how these standards are still evolving."

hometheater,395or9,kagoolx,2,Tue Jun 9 21:01:57 2015 UTC,"Hey, I'm by no means an expert but learned quite a bit when buying some speakers recently (and which I'm absolutely delighted with!)  I also wanted something to go with PS4 etc for a flat, so not an entirely dissimilar situation.  A few things I learned that may be of use:   I definitely think you're right to avoid bothering with a sub.  Just make sure your speakers have decent enough (i.e. low enough as well as powerful enough) bass and you're definitely good there. Speakers make more difference than the amp (provided the amp is powerful enough).  Generally expect to pay more for the speakers than for the amp.  At your price range I'd guess maybe £120 on an amp and £200 on speakers would be a good balance, though no doubt someone will correct me there! The second hand market for buying speakers is very good.  For the same price, you can get better quality if you go second hand.  So second hand is one thing to consider.  Mine were from ebay and I was very pleased with that decision. Whatever you go for, read the reviews online!  Even great brands have occasional crap products. For that price you can easily get something that'll sound great if you're not used to audiophile quality.  A basic good quality amp and a nice pair of speakers will sort you out very nicely.  I'm pretty certain you'll be very impressed with what you hear :-) Before you dive in, one thing to consider: Do you potentially want surround sound - either now or in the future?  Gaming and movies would be better with it.  Music obviously doesn't benefit from it.  If you do want that, you'd need a home cinema amp, which would mean dropping in quality or increasing your budget.  Obviously, you can't just plug an extra pair of speakers into a stereo amp and get surround sound in future! Another consideration: Think of what your source of audio will be.  Do you want to be able to bluetooth audio from a laptop?  Then you'd need an amp that supports that.  I use spotify on the PS4 which is controlled from my phone so it's all easy, and it sounds fantastic.  But it's worth checking how you plan to connect things up. Finally, don't bother spending much on speaker cable or interconnects, they try to upsell you on that stuff and there is a lot of debate about how much difference it makes.   If you're good with just stereo, maybe check out richer sounds and get a bundle deal, or just buy a decent amp and a decent pair of speakers, e.g.:  http://www.richersounds.com/products/hi-fi-separates/separates/hifi-system-deals.  This one especially looks great to me at first glance (I was originally looking at these speakers for myself and they sounded great in the shop, and both Marantz and Monitor Audio are very well regarded):  http://www.richersounds.com/product/hi-fi-system-deals/marantz/pah011438/pah011438  Best of luck with your setup!

That seems to be hit or miss with people.  Now that I've seen zeos hvl-1 review I'm even less sure.  Just to torture myself, how would your recommendation change if my budget was $800?"

hometheater,396i6k,temporary_login,0,Tue Jun 9 16:42:32 2015 UTC,"I have a 48"" Vizio E480i‑B2 which I got for sub-$500 USD. No idea if they sell them in Canada or what the exchange rate is, but I'd recommend it heavily, assuming you get a replacement remote.   We use it for gaming and movies in both daylight and no light situations, and the picture quality is excellent (if set up properly). No input lag that I've noticed, either.   From what I remember of my research back in the day, when a TV isn't specifically advertised to have a 120 Hz refresh rate, but it says 120 Hz on the box somewhere, read the fine print and check out reviews. it probably isn't going to actually refresh at 120 Hz no matter their claims to the contrary.   Also, can't remember exactly where I read this but it was just recently: Samsung has good high end TVs but their mid and low end TVs don't have the same quality and tend to have problems. I'd avoid them. I mean, do some research. Don't take my word for it, but that's what I read.   I'd give you some links but i am on my cell phone and at work.   That's probably my last edit, BTW.

Even at 65"", you would need to sit 8ft away to even notice a slight difference between 1080p, and you would have to sit 4ft away to get the full benefit. But, the 4K TV has a lower input lag, and will most likely have a better build quality. For Upscaling, one pixel in 1080p becomes exactly 4 pixels on a 4K UHD TV, so no problem there."

Edit: I see that receiver does not have preamp outs.  I am unaware of any good ways to control the volume level of your powered speakers without using preamp outputs.

If your display has a movie or expert picture mode, select it as it usually gives the most flexibility. Next make sure your PC is set to HDTV output and is not using an expanded color or black level. You want 16-235 not 0-255.  Get your self some test patterns loaded onto the PC, though a Bluray or DVD would be better, and do a setup for contrast and brightness on the display, then move to the source to fine tune. Don't fuck with gamma unless you absolutely have to, you should really only adjust it if you have a meter to read the light output and adjust accordingly.  If you want to adjust color/tint/hue do them on panel first and then on the source for fine tuning.  Remember, if you connect your PC to another display to default or recalibrate its output as you're configuring it for this particular panel and it may look off on a different display.  Also manufacturer contrast levels are bullshit and don't really mean anything."
hometheater,392yt5,MojoMercury,1 point,Mon Jun 8 23:32:38 2015 UTC,"the best I could do is use windows settings instead of Nvidia's color adjust for now, lower the gamma all the way (for the windows settings -- its equivalent to like, .50 in the nvidia control panel), and only use the brightness and contrast on the screen, NOT the nvidia settings.  I WAS using limited range RGB -- but I switched to YCbCr444 -- which is pretty much the same (component color)... I am using HDMI, not component, but I find the color response APPEARS to be a little bit better -- and the contrast -- to a TINY degree. might just be in my head, but im pretty sure component color and limited RGB are the same -- its what cheap TVs use natively  I know it means almost nothing -- but this TV has SHIT for gamma response and contrast -- you actually LOSE a bunch of color if you set it to anything normal -- so Im stuck using it like this, and gradients still look terrible -- but MOST shades are there.  there will always be some missing - as the contrast ratio and colors are shit.  I will be replacing this with a PC LCD monitor as SOON as I can possibly afford one -- I was going to buy a receiver first with pro logic 2z or the DTS equivalent (height channels + 7.1) and better speakers -- but hey, the monitor is more important as I already have a cheap analog 5.1 system.  the visuals are more important than the sound IMO. and it sounds OK as is -- but looks terrible. I'll upgrade that next.  huge LCD monitors are freaking expensive though -- Im HOPING to get another 32 inch, but I want quality first -- so I MAY be stuck with a 27 or 28 inch -- ASUS had a nice 28 inch for around $300 I may buy, and HP had a 32 inch around $600   I need a fast response time, good color, and excellent contrast ratio (preferrably 80,000,000 - 200,000,000) though -- so this is going to get VERY expensive I imagine.

I'm going to be buying a new PC LCD screen that has at least 80,000,000:1 or greater contrast ratio and full RGB   but until then Im stuck using these settings for best quality.  the gamma HAS to be offset because otherwise it is oversaturated, and setting the TV high and the graphics card low is the only way to seemingly get a non-grainy image that isnt saturated either. I'll probably be sacrificing quality for size, but I really dont want to spend over $500 on a monitor. I may get a 32 inch one, but it is probably a much better deal around  27 or 28.  but this, and buying a receiver and new 7.1 setup has to wait until I get this damn job.

hometheater,391adj,fl0l,8,Mon Jun 8 14:58:39 2015 UTC,Setting up a new unit properly will make all the difference in the world.  I'm wondering what sound field you are currently using.  It sounds like you have just two speakers so why don't you try a stereo or pure direct sound mode?  As far as the volume that would be a source issue or it could be a setting in the AVR.  How does it sound when you put it on regular old FM radio?
hometheater,391adj,Armsc,3,Mon Jun 8 15:04:18 2015 UTC,"First of all, please don't take this the wrong way:   If it does not sound good, then it is probably because of something you did. There is nothing wrong with that Yamaha.   What do you mean by ""push the amp way higher""? Are you referring to how much you need to turn the volume knob? Yamaha receivers use a non-linear volume knob. If you turn it slowly, the volume goes up by very small increments. If you turn it more quickly, it changes the volume much more rapidly. This is actually very handy, as often times, you want to turn something up just a little. But when you need to turn it DOWN, you often need to do so quickly, and whipping the dial to the left turns it down fast.   Yamaha receivers are calibrated to -0dB of output. -0 dB is, after microphone calibration, 105dB measured at the microphone position. That's all fine and good, but what you should remember is that 1dB is the smallest increment that's audible to the average human ear. A change of 3dB is considered ""noticeably louder"". +10dB is considered by most humans to be ""twice as loud"". Increasing the volume knob by +3dB doubles the amount of power required, and +10dB requires roughly 10x the power from your amplifier. Keep all these things in mind as you interpret the volume numbers on the receiver's display. Also, just because -0dB is calibrated to 105dB, it doesn't mean that your speakers are capable of doing it. So just be careful.   Whether or not you run the calibration microphone, the above ""decibel math"" will still be accurate. It just won't be calibrated to real world. Going from -21dB to -18dB is still increasing the volume by 3dB, and still asking your amplifier to double its output. These things do not change.   As to sound quality, try putting your receiver into ""pure direct"" mode. It's that small button above the volume knob. It disables all internal processing, and provides as short and simple of an amplification chain as possible. No tone controls, no nothing. If it still doesn't sound good, then your old Pioneer was playing some sorts of tricks, and you need to figure out what it was doing so you can emulate it with the Yamaha."

hometheater,391adj,GeckoDeLimon,1 point,Mon Jun 8 19:47:53 2015 UTC,"Likely. That Yamaha is very good. The best? Well, no, but Yamahas don't get nearly the credit they deserve, especially where music playback is concerned. They have respectable amplifier sections. But to get the most out of them, you have to make sure that there isn't some DSP trying to fool you into thinking you're sitting in a jazz club or orchestral hall. Those things don't work, no matter the manufacturer. Onkyo, Pioneer, Yamaha, they all suck. :-)  Read the manual, look for straight up ""stereo"" mode, and go for that. Try that ""pure direct"" setting. Also, try playing music off of something connected directly to the receiver instead of streamed. Maybe what you're hearing now are flaws in the source files. All possibilities."
hometheater,391adj,freakinsyco,2,Mon Jun 8 22:21:31 2015 UTC,"I think we need more info.  How does it sound bad?

hometheater,391adj,Xonim,1 point,Mon Jun 8 15:41:51 2015 UTC,"Are you just talking like you need to turn up the volume more or what?  I have a Yamaha RX-V673 that needs to have the volume up to -18db or so on blurays in order to have what I consider appropriate movie sound. My old receiver needed approx -30db to achieve the same perceived volume level.

hometheater,391adj,BOOBS_BOOBS_BOOBS,1 point,Mon Jun 8 19:21:44 2015 UTC,"If I'm not mistaken, it sounds like you have the receiver set to surround sound instead of just stereo. This will cause a large portion of the sound to ""go to"" a speaker that isn't even there. In your case, you're missing three speakers, so you're only hearing the parts of the mix designated for the left and right front speakers, while the majority of the sound is left out due to your lack of a center speaker. This doesn't mean you need to go buy more speakers; you just need to change the settings. Good luck."

Ultimately I sucked it up and fished all the walls for a 7.1 system and used in-wall 12 gauge from Monoprice. The connectors for the flat stuff are also expensive.

Bear with me. I'm going to get a little /r/diyaudio here...  Excessive series resistance mostly creates changes in the bass response of the speaker. It alters the effective electrical Q of the woofer(s), causing them to require a larger enclosure for optimal bass response. Which we obviously can't give them, because they're finished speakers. HOWEVER, if you set your speakers as ""small"" in the receiver and highpass them at 80hz or above, then the speaker will never receive those pesky frequencies where the extra series resistance would have been audible.   Yes, if the wire is long enough, you will lose a little bit of output, but the wire would need to be in excess of any length one would actually need to run in a home. Well over 100'."

Most often you're better off doing your streaming with an external device like a Chromecast or Amazon fire TV or roku. Which device you get will probably be determined by which streaming services he has/wants, whether or not he wants a remote or to just use a phone, and if he wants an ethernet port for faster Internet. Built in smart features on the TV can be slow and not regularly updated with poor UI.   Good news is any TV with an hdmi port can handle any usb device like those, they will all come with a wall adapter to plug the usb cable into. Only the small ""stick"" devices or even usb powered.

hometheater,38xqqw,futtbucked69,2,Sun Jun 7 19:11:06 2015 UTC,"What's the end goal here?  Do you want a home theater for a living area or do you want to convert a room to a dedicated theater?  The former is a little simplier because you're buying components to fit into the space that already exists.  The latter is more complicated because it involves doing a lot of work to the room beforehand to make it right.  Let's say you're going for the former and want to build up a decent living room home theater.  Your primary components will be a source, a receiver and then speakers and a subwoofer.  Are you using a HTPC or a blu-ray/dvd player, streaming content or just for TV programs?  Each of these has different requirements for your receiver but ideally they output into HDMI.  Your receiver should be the one that has all the options/features you want for the lowest price.  Room correction software like Audyssey are a plus.  The usual recommendation is Denon and if you want to save even more, you can get a manufacture refurbished unit from Accessories4less.  Now for the hardest part but arguably the most important part in terms of sound.  You have to find the right speakers FOR YOU.  Not the best speakers ever made, but the ones that sound great for you and fit into your budget.  Chane speakers which are an internet direct company get lots of love around here for the right price.  Other options worth trying risk free are the SVS prime set.  All of these are well into the 1k to 2k range though.  If your budget is lower than that, the Energy 5.0 set is also recommended or you could spend 500 on your front speakers and save up for the rest.  This is the part that I sort of disagree with some here but do not skimp on your subwoofer if you watch a lot of movies.  I even go as far as dedicating 25% or more of your total budget on your subwoofers.  SVS, HSU, Powersound, Reaction, Rhythmik are all well known ID brands that show up often.  Powersound audio especially seems to have some really great value subs for what they output but once again you're in the 1k+ territory quick.  I've made all of these recommendations based on having a theater that will blow you away and last for a long time.  I've already been down the path of buying a budget system and then replacing every single component in the search for the best experience.  More than 5k in and I'm not even close to done yet!"

Do you want a home theater for a living area   Yea, a home theater for a living area.    Are you using a HTPC or a blu-ray/dvd player, streaming content or just for TV programs?   Basically just movies and tv shows, streaming from Netflix and Amazon Instant Video, as well as some movies/shows etc. I might get from online onto a USB drive. I recently bought the Sony XBR55X800B 4k TV that I will be using for it. I migghttt also look into gaming on the 4k TV with my gaming PC, but I'm not sure how well it flows as IIRC  it can lead to some problems with video lag and such.    Your receiver should be the one that has all the options/features you want for the lowest price.   Sorry, can you explain what a receiver is exactly? I tried googling it but its a little unclear to me. Is it just the device I'm using (in my case a TV)? Or is it something separate?  As far as the sound system goes, I think I want to keep it below a $1k budget. Someone on here in a different post mentioned a 5.1 system, and a brief search found me this on amazon (edit; sorry forgot to put link lol. Here it is.), $300, great reviews. What's you opinion on that set?   Do you have any recommendations to finding cheap theatre seats? Not crappy ones, but I don't want to drop thousands on them. Just comfortable reclining seats with cup holders really.   Basically, overall I'm looking for a home theater thats better than the standard couch+tv, but doesn't cost thousands and thousands of dollars lol."

I should have pre-faced earlier that any basic setup concerns can be seen on /r/zeos as well as any components recommendations.  The AV receiver is the control center of your home theater.  In almost every setup you take the sources and run them into your AV receiver.  I said earlier that HDMI would be ideal but most receivers come with a lot of different style of inputs.  The receivers job is to take your source material and decode it so that the video can go to your TV and the sound can go to your speakers.  It is also a source switch in that you can run multiple sources into it and switch between them.    The Energy system that you linked is well respected for it's value but the subwoofer that comes with it is lacking.  This may not be an issue for you coming from no sub though.  I don't really have any recommendations on furniture.  I currently use a very 70s style plaid couch."

And that makes sense what a reciever is, that actually sounds like something i definitely do need xD"
hometheater,38xqqw,rachel133,1 point,Mon Jun 8 02:07:46 2015 UTC,This would be a good buy for $650: http://emptek.com/cinema5.php  Even cheaper we have this good buy for $480: http://www.amazon.com/Definitive-Technology-ProCinema-Speaker-System/dp/B006RDXFOW  When you get your reciever make sure it supports hdcp 2.2(since you have a 4k TV)  Currently your only options are onkyo and Yamaha. I'd wait for Denon's new lineup.

hometheater,38wljr,oversizedhat,1 point,Sun Jun 7 17:48:25 2015 UTC,Great recommendations. I'd also go Samsung since it will direct play from Plex since the TV can decode DTS.

hometheater,38wljr,Bustacap781,2,Sun Jun 7 18:52:37 2015 UTC,What's your opinion on projectors?
hometheater,38wljr,kbv510,1 point,Sun Jun 7 18:59:20 2015 UTC,"I know you weren't asking me, but as a junior AV installer/consumer I dislike projectors.  They introduce a few variables tied to picture quality that IMO aren't worth the hassle.  They are fragile and the color depth is unacceptable.  Remember, especially on a budget, that at the end of the day you are fiddling with an image projected over several feet; it can only get so clear and only be so responsive.  If I were you I would research diligently and get the nicest 1080p tv I could afford."
