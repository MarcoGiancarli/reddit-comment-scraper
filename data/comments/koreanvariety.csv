The whole point of SfSM was that he was an unsuccessful musician in his home country but achieved cult status in a foreign country without his knowledge. This show sounds like it will be maybe 0.1% SfSM (as in: the title & the fact that they're looking for someone) and 99.9% ToToGa."
koreanvariety,3e2daj,NowBiggerAndBetter,4,Tue Jul 21 14:13:07 2015 UTC,"Looking at the MCs, I thought this was gonna be something like a talk show... but I was wrong. So YJS and YHY are going to form their own team of musicians and compete with each other, that's interesting.  I agree that this show seems to be inspired by IC's ToToGa, otherwise there's no reason to cast YJS who isn't a music producer nor a musician (although he has his own songs).  I doubt anyone is going to sub this show since there's no idol."
koreanvariety,3e2daj,ginastringr,3,Tue Jul 21 13:17:21 2015 UTC,"I was expecting something less safe, since it's his first cable show after all....It kinda feels like a combination of IC's totoga and music festival.

Not only for YJS, but for the reason that Totoga did well: South Koreans are very good at honoring their past successful artists and even the younger generations know a lot of the big names of the 80s and 90s.   If they make the research portion compelling, I can see this having explosive ratings, especially with the ahjummas who balloon drama ratings. Don't sleep on this just because you aren't interested in oldies."

koreanvariety,3e2daj,RaginReap,2,Tue Jul 21 16:10:36 2015 UTC,The concept reminded me of their long bickerings on the previous IC music festival. YJS wanted a disco-feel song while YHY wanted an RnB song. Looking forward to it!

koreanvariety,3e2daj,concreteroads,2,Tue Jul 21 23:27:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah, another nostalgic show about artists from 3 decades ago, there's are only like 4 of them recently without counting Totoga and when other outdoor varieties/music shows want to do some actuations with them. Nowadays it's like people want desperately to live in the 80's and can't get over it to get into something new.    I do wait for the searching/convincing part, it was the better part of Totoga and a interesting way to see how life happens to everyone. I'm worried about when they're going to run out of people (other old music shows have already revealed a lot of artists which were missing from the public so, in a way, they can't use them as they are well known) or having to resort to very unknown artists of then; in some way is more interesting what happened to then after failing but the public moves a lot more by big stars.  In short, we have a extremely good MC duo, who have proven good chemistry (last IC music festival) so i think we can expect something good of this."

Can someone explain how the first game worked? It had to do something with filling in the blanks with the sentences? Multiple answers were allowed right?   Can someone also tell me what hoola means? And why it was inappropriate to do with his parents?   Thanks.
koreanvariety,3e0i15,mkatter,2,Wed Jul 22 03:41:21 2015 UTC,"The first game is a spelling quiz, writing down the sentence that's being said.   The reason why they showed the sentences with blanks is because the words in the blanks are the difficult ones. Many Korean words can be tricky due to pronunciation rules. Like ""to cover"" is spelled deop-neun (덮는) but pronounced doem-nuen (덤는) because if you combine ""p"" and ""n"" , you get ""m"" and ""n"".   Hoola is a Korean variation of Rummy, a card game. I guess it would be like playing poker or blackjack with your dad when you were a little kid. Kinda uncommon, especially for those in the older generations."

Last week's episode featured a girl with the concern that her father engages in too much physical contact with her.  Despite the fact that she's going through puberty, her father would aggressively cuddle with her on the bed and kiss her on the lips. Even though she tells him to stop, he engages other acts like touching her butt and inner thighs. In video footage, you can see the daughter physically resisting her father's advances. The father even goes as far as offering her $100 for a kiss. Enraged viewers lambasted the father, comparing his actions to those of pedophiles and sex offenders. The viewers were also incredulous that the producers and the writers of the show would air the episode as if it was an insignificant concern. The daughter eventually wrote up an explanation on her Facebook page as negative comments about her father kept pouring in. She reassured the viewers saying that her father and her family is nothing like what was shown on television. She also went on to say that she never thought about appearing on the show. In fact, she did not send a concern to the program. Instead, the writers of the show had contacts with her younger sister and that's how the connection was made. Also, she stated that the writers of the show would keep messaging her and her father, requesting them to do various things for the video footage. Source (in Korean) Netizens were enraged yet again, as the writers of the show directed the father and daughter to act out certain things. However, netizens are questioning the daughter's statement because even though things were over-embellished and maliciously edited by the writers, that doesn't change the fact that the father's actions were wrong. Source (in Korean) The producers of the show released an official apology, stating that the family and the writers worked hard to create the episode and to showcase the concern. They stated that it's regrettable that some of the viewers' interpretation of the episode differed with their original intent. They went on apologizing to the viewers and to the girl's family.  KBS Looking Back At Myself.   During a press conference on the 13th, Kim Soo-mi was asked about the pilot's ratings. She replied that ""we are safe but the real-time ratings for Jo Young-nam and Lee Kyung-kyu were the worst out of the three pairings."" She went on to say, ""the viewers aren't particularly interested about them"" and kept telling Jo Young-nam to ""accept the truth even though it is coming out of a hoobae's mouth"". (Kim Soo-mi is a junior/hoobae to Jo Young-nam) Jo Young-nam reacted badly, throwing his mic and saying ""from what Kim Soo-mi is saying, it looks like I need to step down from the show. I am not angry. Didn't she say that the real-time ratings (for us) were lackluster? I will step down from the show."" Kim Soo-mi responded with ""yes, leave the show"" and ""hey Yoon PD, hurry up and cast someone else"". Jo Young-nam then stormed out of the press conference. Both Kim Soo-mi and Jo Young-nam were heavily criticized for their behavior by the public and by professional media analysts. The fact that they were dissing each other in the public and escalating the situation instead of playing off the comments as jokes did not look good at all. Not only that, Kim Soo-mi (66) and Jo Young-nam (70) are long-time veterans that should ""know better"". Kim Soo-mi announced that she will halt all activities in the entertainment industry, citing psychological stress from malicious comments on the Internet. In her statement, she also mentioned that she will be seeking psychiatric help to cope with the situation.  On the other hand, Jo Young-nam agreed to stay on board.  On the 20th, the producers of the show released an official statement that the initial reports of Kim Soo-mi leaving the show were false. The producers are still working it out with Kim Soo-mi. The show will begin airing on the 24th, as planned.  CJ E&M Onstyle The Surfers staff deceived singer Lee Jung in the process of cutting him from the show.   The production staff told him that the show was being scrapped and won't be made. Two months later, the show was put back into production with a slightly altered concept but with the same cast. The problem was that no one told Lee Jung about it. Lee Soo Geun was added to the show in his place. Lee Jung lashed out on his SNS accounts saying, ""This is so absurd. After you recruit me for the program and even film my interview, you tell me that due to budget issues the program was scrapped. But now I see that all the other cast members with the exception of me are attending filming. The PD has ignored all my messages, this is no longer funny. Let's see how this all turns out.. Don't live like that."" OnStyle released a statement saying that there was a misunderstanding with Lee Jung and that they reached out to Lee Jung's side and the situation was resolved. Lee Jung lashed out again stating that no one from OnStyle contacted him to resolve the misunderstanding."

Do you know if any other apologies have been offered besides that official one? Just wondering since the official one just seems like a non-apology apology rather than the type of sincere apology in which one admits to being in the wrong and learning from the mistake. Or is the sincerity just lost in translation and the original version in Korean is more like the latter?   Thanks for sharing that information though! I'm still shocked, particularly since, to me, that only seems like the type of low that would be hit by some US daytime talk show that's a mixture of Dr. Phil and The Jerry Springer Show.

Quite a lot of drama (not the tv kind) this week. But first let me ask you: Do you how many episodes of ""3 meals a day"" are left? I think Na PD is preparing to wrap out the season (last season and the island spinoff were like 8-10 episodes long) and to start with his new project.  Going to the controversies:   I saw in /r/korea some video and discussion about that episode of Looking back at myself and was horrified, although the debate was (really unseen on the subreddit) was in way different points and surprisingly more defensive that i would think it would be (the thread is still on the frontpage of the subreddit). I'm not going to discuss if the producers and writers invented things ,the girl was coerced by her father to say so (at least i don't say on the show apology that they recognize this) or it was way magnified. I have never seen any episode. In my opinion, the public had a reason to be offended for once and if this stirs more Jae Suk deserves better that to MC this and already has another show upcoming so if i was him i would abandon the boat. Obviously he isn't going to do it, because he probably only did the show because he has trust with part of the cast/production and is very loyal. But it would annoy me if he has to apologize in representation of the team for something he hasn't done at all.  About the second one, here's a video on the accident. Some may think this was a bit of noise marketing but i think it was real by the two."
koreanvariety,3dw27b,ginastringr,6,Mon Jul 20 01:54:22 2015 UTC,"Three Meals a Day never stated what the total episode count will be. Considering the good viewership, it might go on much longer than the previous seasons.   For the ""Same Bed, Different Dreams"" controversy, I agree that the negative backlash is justified.   Both Yoo Jae Suk and Kim Gu Ra need to jump ship. The ratings for the show were lower than what they expected anyways. If the girl's statement has any truth, then the show was obviously having problems with generating original content. This controversy is the perfect opportunity to call it quits."

But yes, I heard Kim Soo Mi is really affected by everything that happened. I hope she rests well and takes care of her health. Honestly, I don't think it was a good idea by KBS to continue with this pilot, since they are not bringing back the previous cast anyway. I am reminded of The Producers though."
koreanvariety,3dw27b,deoxix,2,Mon Jul 20 02:33:56 2015 UTC,"Funny thing is, a month ago when Kim So Mi guested on Happy Together, she threw a hidden camera prank in which she act like she's upset to another guest to get the MCs flustered. Maybe PMS thought this too was a prank at first."

That prank was funny because all the hosts escaped, leaving Yoo Jae Suk all alone to clean the ""mess""...but yeah, Park Myung Soo probably was abit shocked at how to react, especially since he was a last minute addition to the show...anyway, I personally think it may be a good idea for PMS to not do this show anyway....it seems like a sinking ship and he would be better off focusing on his DJ composing...although, not too sure how that is, financially wise."

I love Ji On but it's like repeating Sarang's past. This is why I'm looking forward to Lee Dong Guk's family"

koreanvariety,3dw27b,sfoura,2,Mon Jul 20 02:52:27 2015 UTC,"I Can See Your Voice (by Mnet) features unknown artists and the public where the guest judge has to identify who have good vocals and who are tone-deaf. The judge decides who to eliminate with help from the guest jury and the final person standing gets to sing with the judge. If the judge is wrong, the final person gets to win money.  Mask King (by MBC) features known personalities like singers, actors, musical actors, gagmen etc who sing behind masks. Eight celebrities will be featured for each 'generation' (one 'generation' is spread over two episodes). Each knockout round features two challengers going head to head and the winner goes to the next round, until there is one person left to challenge the incumbent King. The celebrity panel (usually made up of 11 stars) and audience - a total of 99 votes which means there will be no tie - will decide the winner for each round as well as in the final challenge. The losers will then take off their masks and reveal their identities. The winner gets to keep his/her mask on until he/she finally loses."

It's like Jay Park criticizing Jooheon for not being unique, then copies Dok 2  And sucks that Zico's brother could have gained some gentleman creds, but I get that he really wanted to survive before all"
koreanvariety,3duypk,AIGOOOMONA,4,Sun Jul 19 20:27:00 2015 UTC,Jinusean are old and from a different era in music. Their performance was rubbish but I still think they could help for guidance and know what is right even if they don't have it themselves.

koreanvariety,3duypk,FobbyDigital,8,Mon Jul 20 16:52:32 2015 UTC,Such a dumb guerilla mission. The fact that the producers wanted 28 people to rap in 10 minutes is ridiculous. Should have had clear rules in terms of time to rap or split them into two teams of 14. Telling them that they'd get cut automatically if they didn't rap and then giving them all a time restraint that would not let enough people rap would obviously make the people who hadn't rapped aggressive/desperate.   The producers look even more stupid because they couldn't go through with their threat because not enough people could rap in the allotted time. SMH.
koreanvariety,3duypk,Comingup,3,Sun Jul 19 20:46:02 2015 UTC,PD's of this program are ridiculously stupid. They have a pretty unique concept but just fuck it up with malicious editing and just bad ideas all around. I'm sure this program could grow a lot bigger than it is atm with some decent PD's.

koreanvariety,3dt5q0,shun9132,11,Sun Jul 19 05:16:32 2015 UTC,I loved the segment with Zion T and Haha this week. Haha's idea to bring a Taxi and drive to Yanghwa Bridge based on Zion T's song was great and emotional. Seems like the public liked it to because Zion T's old song Yanghwa Bridge is topping the music charts again.   Link to the song for the lazy: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLUvHUzd4UA
koreanvariety,3dt5q0,flunknight,5,Sun Jul 19 12:52:34 2015 UTC,This is why I'm most excited with Haha and Zion T combo. Haha's raspy voice will be great with that slow tempo RnB style of Zion T.  EDIT: Hyukoh is second (Comes and Goes) and third (Wi Ing Ing) in the charts. IC Superpower!
koreanvariety,3dt5q0,runaway4231,9,Sun Jul 19 13:13:20 2015 UTC,"Kwanghee (as usual) is getting hate again on his social media account. This week's special: Bigbang's fans salty delight. (Sorry for the netizenbuzz link)  And SBS Inkigayo has not allowed Kwanghee's labelmates, 9Muses, because of his departure in Starking.   He can be annoying and there's probably much better fit people than him but how hard it is to give him a chance? IC has gone through a lot of members and if it really doesn't work out, they'll get rid of him. He doesn't have that many segments people who don't like him can just ignore him.  If anything the departure of the two members have seen PMS and JHD stepping up. PMS has been killing it every week and JHD is finally doing something other than giving reactions. I'm loving his Top 4 MC lines."
koreanvariety,3dt5q0,runaway4231,4,Sun Jul 19 15:14:10 2015 UTC,"I have nothing against Kwanghee's comments and fans need to get over it since they're not even within the celebrity inner circle, obviously there's no animosity between Bigbang or Kwanghee (definitely between Kwanghee and JYP though lol), but man KH really doesn't fit the IC mold and his comedy is so over exaggerated and conceited that I really don't think this pairing is going to work out. Everything seems so forced compared to PMS and JHD and while they have years of experience I don't see Kwang Hee developing/ growing in his comedy. Esp. with YB's lack of variety, I don't think KH is going to aide him in the right direction."
koreanvariety,3dt5q0,vintagebrie,2,Sun Jul 19 17:32:11 2015 UTC,"Kwanghee's voice is actually well-suited for trot?? I think a trot song would be a complete game-changer if this group decides to go that route. Few people would expect an all-idol team to do it, not to mention GD actually has experience writing a trot song.  Not only would it be a nice surprise, but since most people in S.Korea enjoy watching IC, trot would be a great way to touch audiences of all ages both young and old. If anything, it would at least help Kwanghee become more recognized among the older/senior audiences.  I'm really happy for Jaesuk, I'm confident that JYP will write him a song that he will love and enjoy performing. It's obvious he's having the time of his life just being able to dance to fun, fast-paced songs.  Overall very, very excited for all the pairings! Junha's team is one I'm iffy about, but Yoon Sang hasn't enjoyed success in the music industry for many years for nothing so we'll see what he has up his sleeve."

HAHA - Zion T: Its sad that no one wants Haha despite him being more musically talented, but people are probably thinking that he has a very narrow music genre and he did not do well in charts last year in charts. Zion T is going to make a hit for sure, but I think its predictable that it is going to be some soul/reggae. I feel Haha wanted a dance song to switch it up.  Hyukoh - JHD: High expectation in terms of entertainment, and I am the most curious about their product. Just checked their music and I am already a huge fan !  Yoon Sang - JJH: poor them, no one wanted either of them :( But then again, both of them kinda messed up their performances   GDYB+kwanghee - low expectations musically and entertainment value. Kwanghee is still very unnatural, and GD can probably see through it and will become awkward.

A member leaving in the future was my biggest worry, as that was what slowly killed FO and 1N2D S2.  Cha Tae-hyun's exemption is also surprising. It seems most of the Dragon Bros. had trouble w/ military service. Kim Jong-kook was called ""Kim Public"" for choosing to serve as a public service worker because of his back, while Jang Hyuk had a scandal w/ draft dodging (idk about Hong Kyung-min)"
koreanvariety,3doump,franklin_donuts,5,Sat Jul 18 01:35:01 2015 UTC,"correct me if i'm wrong about KJK's case, he didn't file about his exemption. he was able to serve 2 full years as a public service worker instead of 6 months (due to his back problems)"
koreanvariety,3doump,franklin_donuts,6,Sat Jul 18 10:31:51 2015 UTC,"I believe you're spot on, I don't remember much of the details myself.  I'm not that certain, but I think his troubles lie mainly w/ how people perceived his choice to serve as a public servant.  Pre-FO/Military he had cultivated this image of a Herculean physical specimen or, as we call him today, a""capable man"" through shows like X-Man, but then he ends up serving as public officer.  Some men even up to now don't consider public office work (or even conscripted police work) as ""real"" service.  Perhaps his choice disappointed a lot of people, and saw his back problems just as an excuse to have it easy w/ his service. So he mockingly got the nickname ""Kim Public"" as a result.  Of course, as time went on it became more evident that his back really is/was fucked up, so people got off his back (heh)."
koreanvariety,3doump,marjin,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:02:58 2015 UTC,"In Healing Camp, he said he did public service because of his back, and his dad was disappointed. He was eligible to serve only 6 months b/c his dad served in Vietnam, but didn't apply for the 6 month thing. I think?"

Based on a quick search, it seems the other (unlisted, minus HKM) Dragon Brothers didn't really have any problems with their military service. Well, with the exception of one Dragon Bro: Yoo Seung Jun. Also, while his scandal didn't really impact Jo Sungmo's own MS, it did apparently cause a pretty big rift between JSM and the other Dragon Brothers."

If we do not host the content, we do not remove it and refer them to the hosting site for removal. Obviously, we cannot remove content that is hosted on another site.  The tricky area is if instead of just a streaming movie, the link takes you to a download of that content that puts it onto your machine. That is closer to actually hosting, and our policy has been to remove that if requested.  Copyright laws weren't really written for the internet, so the distinctions aren't always clear.   I think we can continue on minding our own business. Even if the admins specifically clamp down on this subreddit, we can just indirectly link to a page that has download links.

koreanvariety,3djv0r,Supplycrate,6,Fri Jul 17 15:42:46 2015 UTC,"I guess I'm of the ""I'll believe it when I see it"" persuasion.   Honestly it'd be quite a Herculean task for Reddit to permanently expunge every subreddit that links to off-site copyrighted content, and one which serves basically no purpose. Content creators are generally in the habit of targeting content hosts not link repositories, and when it comes to niche interests like ours those creators are hardly likely to insist upon Reddit enforcing it's rules.   Still if they do decide to root out our little hive of scum and villainy, I think we'll be okay with a little restructuring. Most threads will have to just link to the DF page and let viewers find their own raws / softsubs, inconvenient yes but hardly insurmountable. Linking to the DF rip tool might survive as a grey area. It's more of a shame for obscure fan subbed shows like 3MAD, but we can still have episode discussions without links to alert people to a new episode. If some can't find it on their own, well maybe helpful souls can direct them via PMs.   As I said though, I really doubt they're going to be so comprehensive about this."

The great problem is on the rest of the shows. No Crime Scene (which would never ever would get a official international because it's a cult series more than a popular demand), no 3 meals a day and specifically no The genius which is by far the show with most number of comments every week.  Maybe we should ""suggest"" some other places to search in some posts and keep to talk news and some kind of more disjointed discussion of episodes.  If this subreddit gets banned it would be a pity with all the growth, content and discussions it's has been going through.

koreanvariety,3djv0r,Renxification,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:21:18 2015 UTC,"How does foreign media content count within the copyright rules?  Based on my understanding on anime, once an international license is released, then any subtitled versions would fall under the illegal activity. The only places where it would not be copyright is when the license holder distributes it themselves.   Does KBS/SBS/MBC/JBTC hold such a license? Or have they sold the rights to dramafever, or similar sites to publish their content?   If the license does not exist, then it would not be illegal. I think these videos may belong to the station(s) above, but they may hold a copyright license only for Korea and/or within countries within the vicinity of southeast Asia.  In any case, if a license holder hosts the video content, then I think it would be okay for us to link to the video for it to be discussed. If they are fan cuts and what not, then it can be treated as video used in commentary/review and is not illegal by copyright laws. If the content is not licensed within your country, then the video content is not illegal and is allowed to be freely viewed."

Even the other new 1N2D members got individual KBS awards in 2014.  [1] Kwang-Hee counts, but then again he's only been on IC for a few months. Jongmin's been doing it for 5 and half years."

koreanvariety,3deo4z,Hitokiri2,0,Thu Jul 16 02:01:36 2015 UTC,"Running Man is not a show of which you necessarily need to watch all episodes chronologically: some are just far better than others and some may contain guests you'd like to see.   I've seen around 100 episodes so far and I highly recommend going through some top 10 lists like this one: http://www.soompi.com/2015/04/30/10-of-the-greatest-running-man-episodes-of-all-time/. Then you have the list for guests optionally: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Running_Man_episodes.  The general consensus is that the episodes before 100-120 are the best and that post 200 the format begins to change (for the worse some find). Have fun, I'm watching them all >.<."

koreanvariety,3dc37j,llionell,3,Wed Jul 15 02:46:17 2015 UTC,"The last two episodes were really beautiful and what Hyungdon did was insane but very touching. I think the combination of the beautiful landscapes, a great challenge and that friendship between everyone make them one of the two most compelling hours of variety i have seen this year.  Idea: 2D1N spin-off in which they follow the Seoul-Busan route on bicycle for a week or so. Everyday (for one episode) they ride in the morning to the next city, then they eat there with the locals, play some bolbukbok games (maybe for things like being carried by car for some kilometers the next day) and go to sleep. That would be like 8 episodes i would really see."

Really awesome he didnt quit and finish it.

koreanvariety,3d7y6b,bbplsdonthurtme,8,Tue Jul 14 05:29:18 2015 UTC,"The show rubs me the wrong way a little bit.  This type of show exposes how cookie-cutter and predictable the South Korean ""IT"" girl type is. There are specific rules and there seems to be very little flexibility, to the point that you can fit a variety show around those rules.  I cringed at the videos segment because it's obvious that the girls were severely trying to get attention but these judges were red-buttoning them for such asnine reasons (""its too sexy (except the fact that the next video was just as sexy but wasnt redbuttoned because it was part pure/part sexy like wtf??)"", ""its not appropriate for 6pm (even though its on a damn cable channel)"", and the judge who just red-buttoned everything). The judges annoyed me in general.  I really really felt sorry for Jei when Jisoo basically called FIESTAR and her a flop. I know Jisoo basically was forced to say a name for that segment but you could tell Jei was actually pretty hurt by that. Considering FIESTAR is a more successful group than TAHITI, it's all the more cringe-worthy to see.  Finally, the singing portion annoyed me because Suzy isn't an IT girl because of her vocal skills. She's decent but she's not a powerhouse vocalist so to judge idols, many of which aren't even lead vocals in their group, was a bit much.   All in all, I've seen the raws of EP2 and I just think the show is pretty contrived and my expectations aren't met. I'll continue watching but I can't say this is going to be must-see."
koreanvariety,3d7y6b,sfoura,2,Tue Jul 14 22:17:05 2015 UTC,"Well said, thanks for being a trooper for the team to review. I closed the tab 5 minutes during the introduction.   Btw. I liked fiestar (I actually bought their album and I don't buy albums in general) so I was assuming I'd stay for Jei but it was an impossible task for me. It was a cringefest from the very beginning. (for tahiti to say that out of all people kind of irritates me a bit and I'm no hardcore fan of fiestar)"
koreanvariety,3d7y6b,cjbt,2,Wed Jul 15 11:53:24 2015 UTC,"Yeah, a TAHITI member(of all groups) is what made that statement worse. Even more so, saying that to a sunbae, a more successful one at that...Jisoo is lucky that Jei didnt go onstage and smack her in the face for the disrespect.  If Jisoo was smart, she would have said her own group and use that to be humble and acknowledge that they have more work to do as a group."

koreanvariety,3d2g2c,hubwub,15,Mon Jul 13 00:02:34 2015 UTC,"Kind of surprising to me how academic some of the reviews of the running man episodes have become.   In a side note half-relevant, half-not; One eventually forgets how much effort and complexity there is one chapter of a variety show and how they have to edit like it's the most casual and simplest thing. Behind every part there can be almost 100 hundred persons of different expertise involucrated in continuous 24h or more recordings, which usually involucrates a lot of travelling and preparation on-site. It's like recording a huge drama or film but you have to trust you cast can naturally make a good show for themselves without any script (if you don't do scripts). And then there's a PD or an editor (remember the editing segments on ""Producer"") who is locked-up for maybe an entire day looking over and replaying every clip from all the angles to make the most compelling show/story. And that's every week 52 weeks a year.   Thinking about it, just for a moment, makes me understand better why running has been playing safe for so long, there are some many thing that could go wrong that they prefer to die veeery slowly with a proven formula."

Maybe the game format just brings it out of people? I do see some familiar names from those forums here in the sub.  Also I could not agree more w/ your side note.

Legitimately KJK would win every single one unless it was a scripted event/legitimate injury.

I was excited to see Seolhyun but she was real timid and didn't get much air time cause she got partnered with Gary and in the first game it was with Ji Hyo and Suk Jin and as much as I love them they them three don't get much air time as it is. Oh well still a fun episode
koreanvariety,3d2g2c,blockdmyownshot,3,Tue Jul 14 04:04:56 2015 UTC,"I don't know, I thought gary has been getting quite a bit screentime over the past few episodes, more than most actually. This episode had a little less screen time and it has something to do with the games and orange team coming last, but at the end of the day, guests have to actually do something to get screentime. It seemed like she didnt contribute a lot during the games, dancing sections, or conversation. Maybe Gary's interest made it awkward but there were other times she could've spoken and she just chose to be more of a spectator. IF it wasn't for gary, she would've gotten a lot less screen time I think, considering how well the other guests did - i mean guk joo, soyou, and bora were exceptional."

They're really good at getting people involved and eliciting some kind of response which either would've led to her saying more or making her more at ease she just seemed real shy the whole time even so much that Gary at the end was like you're smiling now!  Edit: and I meant in my opinion Gary doesn't but I could be totally wrong I only really notice when people are completely shafted for screen time as ji hyo seems to be lately or dominate the episode as YJS always does, for good reason though"

koreanvariety,3d2g2c,ttg13,-25,Mon Jul 13 19:04:25 2015 UTC,"Seriously, i found this episode one of the worst. Members never talk, and the dancing its only for girls promotion, i've seen this thousand times in RM, nothing new, only mini games, only play, and its becoming very boring, too much people."

Soyu should get invited more, and I think she will be even more awesome if there are fewer guests."
koreanvariety,3d2g2c,KimGG,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:53:56 2015 UTC,"I agree tbh. Roommate was the only other show I've seen GJ on, and I remember the weight jokes got old real fast.  I guess what I should've said is that because she is a comedian it was expected of her to bring the funny. Or something like that lol.  But as this was just one episode, her antics were mostly amusing enough for me to be entertained. Though I would say I was more entertained by the Sistar girls. And Jaesuk, always Jaesuk."
koreanvariety,3d2g2c,weathervaanes,2,Wed Jul 15 02:25:58 2015 UTC,"I just wanna do a quick shoutout to the editors of this episode. I really like the mix of music used, the cuts felt smoother and is an overall upgrade to the previous episodes. While the ending I felt is a tad bit too long and unnecessary, it's still a suspenseful one."

Personally, I partially enjoyed this episode probably due to the previous episode already have female group/idols as their guests (SNSD).   I was quite surprised she used to be in RM last summer, I need to rewatch the episode again."
koreanvariety,3d2g2c,Isketam,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:13:19 2015 UTC,What's the name of the song when Jaesuk and Jong Kook are about to begin their cushion flipping game? It play quite a bit when those two are playign head to head (ddakji/etc.).
koreanvariety,3d2g2c,sung_moon,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:59:18 2015 UTC,"This episode was a total 180 for me in comparison to the last few episodes. I had been apprehensive when the pairs had first been reported through fan reports, and especially so soon after another episode involving pairs and a water park, but it was nice to see that they were handled differently as the episode went on, and that the entertainment level remained fairly consistently high throughout the episode.   I also was extremely pleased that the editing (of both the video and sound) had been waaaay better after the experience of the subpar jobs in the last two episodes. The editing even successfully made spoiler. I had also at one point worried that the preview shown for the last round had been the actual final version of the round, so I was relieved by and satisfied with the final duration of the last round. It didn't seem too long or too short to me, but just right though there had definitely been certain segments cut from it.   The variety in the music used had also been nice, and it had also been amusing to hear them use spoiler If I could suggest one thing though, it would be even better if they could spoiler  There are still obviously other improvements they could make, but I really enjoyed this episode as a whole even without the subs and hopefully the quality will be similar, if not better, for next week's episode.   Also, just want to note that even though there had only been a few seconds of it, spoiler"
koreanvariety,3d2g2c,amelisa28,3,Mon Jul 13 10:57:42 2015 UTC,"I always thought Jaesuk, Jongkook, and Jihyo would be too strong of a team, unless they had good opponents."
koreanvariety,3d2g2c,dancingmochi,1 point,Tue Jul 14 07:25:55 2015 UTC,"Eh, respectfully, I disagree with the general concern of them being ""too strong of a team"" because of how other factors would come into play. I understand why, considering their reputations, but they all have certain weaknesses, and even then, their strengths may not work in their favor during the games. It would also be highly likely that the other teams would/could ally against them and that might naturally add to the entertainment level.   Good opponents may balance it out, but games with a leveled playing field would also do the same. That definitely impacted the final result of games in the past year where JK and JH were on the same team since, despite the consistency of their determination to win, the closest to a win had been the tie in 228. JS/JK and the Candy Alliance are a bit of a different story since the final result of the episodes (the entire episode, not just the mini-games) their partnerships had been featured in had been skewed towards a certain result. But you could also compare the group of JS, JK, and Kim Min-jung in episode 50. They did win in the end, but (scripting aside) they easily could have lost too since the whole cast is skilled in searching. This latest ep also serves as an another example since despite the fact that spoiler  This is also a more superficial and opinion-based reason, but if the show doesn't mind having an extremely weak team in the form of SJ and JH, would it be that much of a difference to have a slightly stronger team in the form of JS, JK, and JH? For one episode, I mean, not multiple episodes like with SJ and JH."
koreanvariety,3d2g2c,amelisa28,0,Tue Jul 14 10:29:57 2015 UTC,I feel bad for Ji Sukjin. He's always paired up with Jihyo (not that its a bad thing though).
koreanvariety,3d2g2c,Trn4mr,3,Tue Jul 14 00:32:46 2015 UTC,I do too but I kind of get it. Like before ji hyo has volunteered to be his partner so the other female guests didn't have to which is sad but looking at last week it kinda could be a bummer to lose every game haha

koreanvariety,3d2g2c,Enter_Text_Here,1 point,Tue Jul 14 07:21:50 2015 UTC,Someone predicted that Sistar well lose their hair extension somewhere in the show. That prediction came true during the rice bowl game. That person deserves a cookie!
koreanvariety,3d2g2c,Hitokiri2,-2,Wed Jul 15 02:15:48 2015 UTC,"Loved this episode, and i hope dance battles become a staple... But being black, the blackface moment was a bit disarming... but otherwise great as usual from running man!!"
koreanvariety,3d2g2c,PoplorockoKY,3,Tue Jul 14 03:45:15 2015 UTC,"I don't think Kwangsoo was not doing a blackface look, more like a ""I just fetched a lot of charcoal"" look but it can definitely be easily taken out of context."
koreanvariety,3d2g2c,Trn4mr,1 point,Tue Jul 14 12:56:47 2015 UTC,"I felt the same way, I thought that moment would backfire heavily.  And you could see that the editors thought the same, the amount of captions during that segment was insane, lol. They did everything to try and save him, and it seems to have worked out. Haven't read any  news about that ""blackface"" after the episode."
koreanvariety,3d2g2c,KimGG,-6,Tue Jul 14 23:52:00 2015 UTC,"Context is the difference between a pelvic exam and sexual assault, so...  Again, E255 offers nothing new that hasn't been seen before and yet RM managed to cram enough action to make an interesting episode through and through.  Is it merely coincidence that the end game queens got paired as they did?  Generally, ""failure"" games that repeat the same thing over and over slide into the boring territory, but in this case, the multitude (again) alleviates.  Notice the difference in dancing interruptions when games are on pause vs. E254.  Way to milk an ending for everything it's worth (yes, the team that lost was always going to lose).      People like to talk about RM quality, but what about context? How does this episode fare compared to, say, E089 Music Fairy Part II:  Escape from Wonderland?  Whereas E255 generates interest with overflowing action, E089 puts viewers to sleep with complete lack of action.  Nothing worse than a bad episode as a boring one."
koreanvariety,3d2g2c,yankee_whiskey,-2,Tue Jul 14 00:11:05 2015 UTC,any update on the subs ?
koreanvariety,3d2g2c,MightyMorph,0,Mon Jul 13 21:53:48 2015 UTC,DramaFever hardsubs are up.
koreanvariety,3d6ojg,d-x2,3,Mon Jul 13 23:08:28 2015 UTC,"The beauty of long running shows like Running Man, 1N2D, and IC is supposed to be that you have top tier cast members and you can do virtually anything since it's not a gimmick like dads and babies or the army..but I actually think RM is restricted by something weird..I actually think the games themselves are the problem.  The problem is RM has basically played every game that has been invented on Earth, and they have mastered every way of winning, losing, playing gags, cheating, etc...The viewer knows exactly what will happen at each time, so it doesn't matter that everything is perfect and hilarious..the problem is it's already been done.  It would violate the spirit of RM, but I wonder if they would do a multi episode shoot where they just chill or focus on some bigger picture task instead of 'try to win X game and get X prize at the end'. Of course then they would be accused of copying 1N2D or IC..but I think it would be refreshing."
koreanvariety,3d6ojg,TaeTaeyeon,6,Tue Jul 14 19:04:29 2015 UTC,"From what I understand, the overall opinion is the same as inetz have.  Too many guests, too many minigames etc etc."
koreanvariety,3d6ojg,KimGG,5,Mon Jul 13 23:56:56 2015 UTC,"There's actually a post yesterday about the 5th year anniversary. Knetizen said that it's no more Running Man, but Game Man or Guest Man. But, no one actually said that RM got boring or unfunny...they prefer to watch the member, not a bunch of guests.  Oh and they want the classic name tag ripping game back."
koreanvariety,3d6ojg,ginastringr,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:15:25 2015 UTC,why don't they do the name tag game?
koreanvariety,3d6ojg,howcanilose,5,Tue Jul 14 01:35:34 2015 UTC,"I really need to look for the source of this quote one of these days since it's come up in my mind so many times during these kinds of discussions, but during the interview section in one of the fanmeet trips last year, JSJ mentioned that the RM members have just gotten too good at it and if the cast members just do it by themselves, the results are pretty predictable, so it's just not as fun to do these days."
koreanvariety,3d6ojg,amelisa28,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:23:19 2015 UTC,the members are so good that there are very few guests out there that could beat them unless they go easy on them which they often have to do these days. Not to mention KJK if he went all out could eliminate everyone single handedly.
koreanvariety,3d6ojg,sportsteambfan,0,Tue Jul 14 21:08:24 2015 UTC,"Because Kim Jong Kook wins it 99% of the time as long theres no betrayal or twist to it   He has to much of a physical advantage in a physical game  its no fun because it always ends the same .. either someone has a reflect and saves it for KJK, or they all team up against KJK or he gets betrayed by either Kwangsoo, Sukjin or Haha"
koreanvariety,3d6ojg,FFridge,-1,Tue Jul 14 15:48:50 2015 UTC,Perhaps the various agencies and managers of the guests are reluctant to put their talent through long filming hours of potentially violent physicality.
koreanvariety,3d6ojg,velspar,4,Tue Jul 14 02:04:48 2015 UTC,11% is not bad.it a a five years old show   and kjk health is the reason behind stopping tag ripping game in my opinion
koreanvariety,3d6ojg,zadeepzone2,0,Tue Jul 14 04:54:23 2015 UTC,Every show had a boost rating this day because of a typhoon.
koreanvariety,3d6ojg,alexqq,1 point,Tue Jul 14 08:39:48 2015 UTC,"As much as I enjoyed the Nametag ripping, I also enjoyed the other events that happened. Wasn't there one or two episodes where they chased SJH or a guest across the country?  It's been a long time since I've seen, so I might be wrong. In fact, it was rather similar to Infinity Challenge episode with the bonus check chase."
koreanvariety,3d17y2,mkatter,7,Sun Jul 12 17:59:40 2015 UTC,"Looking great!   JTBC Please Take Care of My Refrigerator = 5.451%. First time in the 5% range.   Episode 34, starring legendary singers Park Jung-hyun (Lena Park) and Lee Moon-sae.  Episode 8 of tvN Mr. Baek The Homemade Food Master = 7.303%.   Episode 1 = 2.156%.   KBS Cool Kiz on the Block's first episode of swimming = 5.4%. Highest rating since June 2 (first episode of cycling).    Permanent members: Kang Ho-dong, Jung Hyeong-don, Seo Ji-suk, Sean, SNSD's Yuri, CNBLUE's Kang Min-hyuk, actor Sung-hoon.  The two-headed monster SBS Law of the Jungle and tvN Three Meals a Day dominates Friday night in the post-'The Producers' era. KBS pilot Heir (후계자), a trot audition show, notches a healthy 5.8% and gets positive feedback from viewers.    It's not your average audition show because the MCs and the cast members trek around the country, going into businesses and public areas, looking for talent. Second (and last) episode next week.  Mnet Show Me The Money 4 doubles its rating from 1.756% to 3.479% as Round 3 of the competition plays out.    Snooooooooooooop.  KBS Youth FC Hungry Eleven knocks off JTBC Where Is My Friend's Home for the #1 spot.    Very positive feedback from viewers. Very heartwarming show but has a gritty competition aspect. KBS is on a roll lately with its new pilots and shows.  tvN drama Oh My Ghost and variety show The Genius: Grand Final are both bringing in good viewership despite stiff competition from KBS/SBS/MBC dramas and KBS/JTBC/Channel A varieties.   Typhoon Chan-hom  Ratings shot up across the board on Sunday as people stayed home to avoid the typhoon/tropical storm/tropical depression/whatever it downgraded to.   Return of Superman, King of Mask Singer, and 1 Night 2 Days got boosts of 3.4%, 3.2%, and 2.9%. Running Man got a modest boost of 1.3%. Take Care of My Dad and Real Men 2 round the bottom of the list with 1.0% and 0.7% boosts.  King of Mask Singer is almost there but the last ~1.0% gap is proving to be a big problem. Return of Superman extends its record to 54 weeks. Real Men hangs on to the #2 spot by the skin of its teeth.    Uh, oh...   JTBC Abnormal Summit's ratings shot up to 4.687% as people tuned in by the masses to watch the new cast. It was the highest rating since February 23, 2015 (5.219%).    Contrary to the ratings, the viewer feedback was extremely negative, lambasting the show for making unnecessary changes to the cast, especially to Takuya.  The first episode with the new cast was extremely chaotic, with the MCs and the cast going off on tangents and not discussing the main topic. It will take some time until the new members fully settle in. The Polish guy (Przemysław) had the most positive feedback out of the new members.   MBC drama Splendid Politics (Hwajeong) continues its downward spiral due to crappy scriptwriting by the writers and crappy acting by Lee Yeon-hee and Seo Kang-jun. Even Cha Seung-won and the very talented supporting cast can't save this drama.   Last 3 weeks: 11.6 > 10.7 > 10.0 > 9.8 > 8.9 > 8.8 (SBS drama High Society overtook Hwajeong in the ratings this week) Hwajeong is only at its 26th episode out of 50 total. There's a strong possibility that it will be cut short. Or maybe they could just kill off Lee Yeon-hee and Seo Kang-jun's characters. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯    Programming changes   JTBC 5 Days of Summer ends.   Rerun of Witch Hunt will air next week. No news of replacement program.  JTBC Mom Is Watching ends.   Rerun of Abnormal Summit will air next week. No news of replacement program.  TV Chosun South Man North Woman Season 2 will launch on July 17 at 11 PM.   Season 1 (50 episodes) was a success, peaking at 5.369%. It is a virtual marriage show (like We Got Married and a handful of other shows) with South Korean men (celebrities) and North Korean women (defectors).    Upcoming news   KBS Looking Back At Myself finalizes its cast. First episode will air on July 24 (Friday).   Park Myung-soo replaces Jang Dong-min. Choi Min-soo and F.T. Island's Lee Hong-ki were added. Lee Kyung-kyu, Park Myung-soo, and Choi Min-soo will take on the role of a star manager. By taking on this humbling role, they will be able to look back at their own lives. The stars will be Jo Young-nam, Kim Su-mi, and FT Island's Lee Hong-ki. Choi Min-soo being a manager for Lee Hong-ki? LOL"

Tell me before i become fond of them, it hurts less."
koreanvariety,3d17y2,ZoddGutts,8,Mon Jul 13 00:27:32 2015 UTC,"June 14, 21, 28 was the female friend special.   July 5, 12, 19 is a ""To Your House"" special where they went on a two night, three day trip visiting three of the members' childhood homes and meeting their families. Very heartwarming trips are generally well-received by the 1N2D viewer base.  Human Condition 3 is pretty good in my opinion. The ratings are deceiving because it starts airing 15~20 minutes later than the rest of the competition (at 11:30 PM). It's a very passive viewing experience. I mean, the main aspect of the show is building an elaborate garden on top of this huge rooftop. The two chefs are pretty entertaining. Yoon Jong-shin is good as ever. I like the rest of the cast too. Much better than Season 2. It's on par or slightly worse than Season 1."

I'm not saying anything about the other episodes.  **EDIT2: Alright, I was wrong about the copying. Evidently, mkatter is a lot more knowledgable about Korean variety than I am."
koreanvariety,3d17y2,Resistantperm,12,Mon Jul 13 01:07:50 2015 UTC,"the good parts have been games they've basically copied from runningman's early days in the first place.   But they were copied from 1N2D Season 1, which came way before Running Man. But then again, you could say that 1N2D Season 1 ""copied"" the games from variety shows that came before it. Besides, a lot of games on variety shows are a variation of some playground game.   If you think Running Man is better than 1N2D, that's perfectly valid opinion. But 1N2D copying Running Man? LOL.   *EDIT: I'm referring specifically to the 2 most recent episodes, with the elderly singing songs and they have to figure it out, as well as the picking up members segment.   The elderly singing songs game has been done by 1N2D Season 1 and a handful of other very old shows. Games that involve music blaring in your ears was first pioneered by 가족 오락관 (Family Arcade), a KBS variety that aired from 1984 to 2009.   Picking up cast members in front of their houses or driving around to form teams has been done by Infinite Challenge many times.   Neither of these two things were pioneered by Running Man. And neither of them are defining characteristics of Running Man.  I can use your logic against you and point out a ton of games that Running Man ""copied"" from other shows. But no one really cares what program did what game first."

On the other hand, my favorite name tag ripping game is when they have to find or figure out something before they can rip someone's name tag. Something like in episode 100 was great, not exactly a name tag game but they need to find each god's weakness before eliminating him/her. Oh and 007 episode with Lee Seung Gi and Park Shin Hye too.  But it'll be super tiring...walking around for hours. Maybe that's why RM rarely do this kind of episode nowadays."
koreanvariety,3d0ld0,ginastringr,13,Mon Jul 13 02:25:12 2015 UTC,"I missed those simple music/ card/ mind games they use to play in the beginning because it allowed everyone to talk amongst each other, build up jokes, and give good screen time esp. if the guests aren't very athletic. There is waaaaayyyyyyyyyy too much slow-mo, anticipation cuts that lasts for minutes. It doesn't get me excited, just frustrated like I'm watching a Youtube ad. And I end up just fast forwarding it.   I understand though cause when writer's develop the games they really don't know how it will play out during filming. It all depends on what the cast/ guests do to make it entertaining. This definitely applies to Name Tag games, too. I expect that the 2PM ep. will be intense, so looking forward to next week."
koreanvariety,3d0ld0,vintagebrie,5,Sun Jul 12 18:36:51 2015 UTC,"not joking but im pretty sure, the 2pm episode will be only 10 minutes of action, the last 10 minutes, the rest mini boring games."
koreanvariety,3d0ld0,deckard1985,2,Sun Jul 12 18:41:53 2015 UTC,I'm hoping for 30 minutes. Ah well...
koreanvariety,3d0ld0,vintagebrie,12,Sun Jul 12 19:01:09 2015 UTC,Some of those comments have convinced me to go back and watch the older ones. Think I'll watch Min Soo and the superpower episode again tonight. It was so much fun back then. The episode  after the superpower one where Gary returned from Europe jetlagged and slept the entire episode what hilarious. Everyone kept bothering him for clues.  Shame it has become what it has. And shame on the fanboys/fangirls downvoting the submission because it is negative towards a show they like. Grow up and read the rules.
koreanvariety,3d0ld0,Oat-,4,Sun Jul 12 16:30:03 2015 UTC,"For once, I think the knetz share the same thoughts about RM as inetz do.  Almost all I ""talk"" to on different k-forums agree that it was better when they had the nametag ripping and bell hide'n'seek.  I agree with them, but then again, the RM cast has become so damn good at nametag ripping, that any guests they bring on wont stand a chance. So they need to come up with something new and exciting. The mini games are getting old pretty fast."
koreanvariety,3d0ld0,KimGG,5,Sun Jul 12 15:55:11 2015 UTC,"then better without guests, or play the game with teams, the mission team vs the chasing team. The guests are only guests, why change the format because of the guest."
koreanvariety,3d0ld0,deckard1985,2,Sun Jul 12 18:31:39 2015 UTC,I agree :) I find RM to be more enjoyable when there are no guests or maximum 3 guests.
koreanvariety,3d0ld0,KimGG,1 point,Sun Jul 12 18:44:22 2015 UTC,"Even if the RM cast has gotten really good at nametag ripping, that doesn't stop them from getting overpowered by raw strength and speed, which is why the whole cast got bodied by Choo Sung-Hoon when they had him show up for the Bounty Hunting episode, or how when they brought in those two baseball players they got most of the cast outside of KJK."
koreanvariety,3d0ld0,King_Rajesh,2,Mon Jul 13 16:48:31 2015 UTC,"Obviously:  Ep. 1 to Ep. 6: Escape from locked building.  Ep. 7 to Ep. 25: Bell Hide-and-Seek.  Ep. 26 to Ep. 47: Find the guests.  Ep. 48 to Ep. 255 (Still counting): Minigame races, although episodes until around Ep. 130 did have elimination/tag games at the end. After that, we know the story.  As you can find above, RM was more changing and various (hence the name variety) during its first year than 4 years after. They mentioned on an interview that this minigame format seemed to be one that brought ratings, and it's a big mistake on their part. RM's ratings suddenly rose around the Thailand specials (Ep. 50/51), which coincides the time they were starting this new minigame format. This gave them ideas to stick to this format ever since, which was a misunderstanding on their part. Ep. 50 was around the time when the cast chemistry/characters began to improve, and along with many media reporting how much popularity it had at Thailand, RM got boosts ever since. It wasn't the format like they are thinking because those fans at Thailand obviously didn't watch their first 50 episodes for it. At least some of the first minigame race episodes were really good, with elimination games as a part on nearly every episodes, more attention to the members and what they did, and without repetitive and silly games like mud and mats. Even minigames were the best, they should have at least considered going back and listened to those demands on nametags (which has no meanings now) because these kind of comments come up every single day.  I consider RM's members as the best out of all Korean varieties (even IC IMO), and still have hopes because of it. But too bad the staff doesn't use that ingredients but use them as a background and tool to promote their guests. It's just they are acting full and satisfied without hunger they did at old times. They will still get money and fame from promoting guests and fan events outside Korea even with like 5% ratings. This mannerism and their fans who still praise everything they do is bigger enemy than 1N2D or Real Men."
koreanvariety,3d0ld0,kyopda,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:17:18 2015 UTC,My favorite is when the RM members have to trick the guest(s). The episode with Choi Ji Woo is one of my favorites!

So many ideas yet to explore, but the PDs obviously do not have much imagination. There is so many running type games, but the PDs do not know how to do research. They totally forgot what running man is all about. The comedy, suspense, bonding, individual talent and BGM is to me the recipe for running man success."

koreanvariety,3d0ld0,Warlord_X,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:02:27 2015 UTC,"Might have to do with frequent injuries the casts gets during filming. So they can't do the name-tag ripping that often.  Maybe they can alternate the games between tag-ripping, mind games, puzzles and fan-made games once in a while for each episodes."
koreanvariety,3d0ld0,Isketam,4,Sun Jul 12 19:51:21 2015 UTC,i found the minigames more exhausting than the name tag ripping.
koreanvariety,3d0ld0,Warlord_X,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:08:27 2015 UTC,"I rather play nametags and few other games at one location like they did at old days, instead of driving hundreds of miles and playing games like doing sit ups while carrying people on my back (Yes, even during the times KJK's back pains were the worst) or physical fights at mudfields.  Yeah, I don't understand why RM has to be very physically demanding as the guests say when its most famous aspects as mindgames/betrayals."

Not sure if it was pre-planned, or it was completely done live, but its one of the most disappointing ones though all years, hopefully my mind will change from the following eps  I think everyone can agree (unless you are his fan) that Kwanghee and GDYB is the most disappointing letdown pair up. I think GD with anyone else would be very funny and entertaining but yea :/ Like even the group shot is awkward as hell. Kwanghee and IU would have been a much better matchup, but guess no one really wanted to pair up with him, I mean he is the least popular member currently and I am sure IU fans would be offended if she ended up with her first appearance on IC with him lol.   YJS - JYP: This is an awesome matchup, totally looking forward to it, they fit eachother perfectly, personality-wise, music style wise, and JYP is super good at producing when he wants to  Myungsoo - IU: sucks for IU. Wanted to hear her producing, but Myungsoo is probably going to force her to make a hit for him instead of him adapting to her style. I think Haha or Kwanghee would have been a better fit.   Junha - Yoon Sang: It's going to be interesting, don't know what to expect, but I have high expectations in terms of musicality :)  what I wanted: Kwanghee-IU (it's might boost his popularity). Haha - GDYB, JYP-YJS (or gdyb, but never going to happen), Myungsoo-ZionT. Junho - Yoonsang, Hyukoh - JHD."
koreanvariety,3czq53,AIGOOOMONA,1 point,Tue Jul 14 05:35:06 2015 UTC,I hope Kwanghee - GDYB could present a fresh variety interaction for pre-festival episodes. I mean GD has been attending twice before (not counting muhan company appearances) and having paired with another original member would hardly bring a new character for the pair.
koreanvariety,3czq53,urishiwon,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:27:43 2015 UTC,Kwanghee can't sing so someone who can produce pop and at least same aged with him would be better so he can be at least not be too self-conscious. Myungsoo can sing decently at least and IU will have to do everything like always but at least he can make his segments entertaining without any problem.   lol imagine Zion T being forced to do songs that have high beats per minute Myungsoo and YJS loves. At least YJS will concede to his partner but Myungsoo will force what he wants and I can already imagine it being a little bit awkward.

koreanvariety,3czq53,nighoblivion,2,Wed Jul 15 21:12:33 2015 UTC,"YJS+JYP: They're going to be a lot of fun and probably make a good song. No big surprises though.  IU+PMS: musically they're like oil and water. They might come up with something really interesting (especially if PMS gives up on his desire to produce a club hit) or they might crash and burn. I agree with IU that Myungsoo's voice would match guitar music well, though his narrow range might be a problem.   Haha+Zion T: really looking forward to this.   JHD+Hyukoh: It seems like many people have high expectations for this. I'm not really sure what to expect, but I'm cautiously optimistic. I think their voices match well.   JJH+Yoonsang: They have the ability, but do they have good enough ideas? Both seem a bit timid so I'm not sure how they'll work together.   GDYB+Kwanghee: Not expecting much. I think they were going for comedy points."
koreanvariety,3czq53,divenose,2,Tue Jul 14 11:19:49 2015 UTC,"As days passed by, my disappointment that Yoon Sang didn't end up with Hyung Don lessened, 'cause as I watch the raw episode 436 (4 times now), I feel like there are other pairings that I also wished happened:  YJS-Hyukoh - If only JYP didn't steal  YJS-Zion T - I don't know what they are saying yet since there are still no english sub, but it seems that Zion T. also wants YJS to be his partner  Hyung Don-Zion T - They also have chemistry, it's all about chemistry you know :D  YJS-Yoon Sang - I mean his buddies, Lee Juck and Hee Yeol paired up with Jae Suk hyung before, so seeing him with YJS will be fun, YJS can make Sang hyung comfortable since I think he's still not used to this kind of variety  Now back with the pairing:  YJS-JYP - good for JYP since I think out of all Mudo members, he only feels comfortable with YJS, they will make a dance song, hope it will be a hit  PMS-IU - A little bit excited, I have a feeling they will make a song like Cold Noodles, if this happens, WOW  Hyung Don-Hyukoh - I have to admit I'm starting to look forward to it. Hyung Don can make them adjust with the variety  Haha-Zion T - They have a similar vibe :D  Kwanghee-GD/Taeyang - I don't know what to say, the least interesting pair up for me  Junha- Yoon Sang - I trust Sang hyung that he will make a great music, however, it seems Junha want to go with rapping, I'm not quite sure about that, But i still trust Sang hyung :D"

koreanvariety,3cxnsf,sportsteambfan,12,Thu Jul 16 01:07:37 2015 UTC,"SPOILERS BELOW:  spoiler  For round 2, some people may disagree with this but I think Sangmin's move was actually a really good one. Having everyone vote on the same item will realistically only happen once per game. So Sangmin only had this one opportunity to use the box trick to gain the points. Had it worked properly, Sangmin could just keep feeding Kyunghoon information without the rest of the players ever knowing. However, Kyunghoon screws him over by telling everyone that Sangmin was working with him.  Now for Round 3, Sangmin tells Kyunghoon to vote on the wrong item. Not much more to comment on this round.  Round 4 was such a tragedy for Sangmin. Not only did he get screwed over in Round2 by Kyunghoon, but he also destroys Sangmin's chances in round4. The amazing thing is that despite being outcasted, Sangmin was still able to set up a play that would guarantee him to not be last. However, Kyunghoon once again ruins it for him by telling Junseok their strategy.  It's really sad to see such a great player leave despite playing amazingly throughout the season."

His plan to make Kyunghoon first so that he could receive immunity: Failed  Next plan to avoid being last: Failed  Final plan to trick Kyunghoon in hopes of surviving the deathmatch: Failed  Kyunghoon is definitely a plan destroyer.

So far junseok has been excellent in game reading and intercepting, even back in his s2 guest appearance he intercepted that he was going to be killed by sangmin. Great play from junseok.   Without sangmin, the dynamics of the game will change a bit. I expect Dongmin and Hyunmin to run the show now."
koreanvariety,3cxnsf,joeblitzkrieg,7,Sat Jul 11 23:59:45 2015 UTC,"Junseok will be the hidden dark horse in this season I think. There are plenty of active players such as Hyunmin/Dongmin/Jinho etc, that Junseok will probably have more ease with his shadow plays. Also his vengeance from S1 will be his reasons to not being drag along by the majority.  I can see Dongmin might be the next ""show runner"" since a lot of players tend to follow his leadership. You can see it in this episode and the last, how they put a lot of trust in Dongmin. I kind of don't want Dongmin to over exert his dominance. Because we all know what happen to Kim Gura when he force people to play his ways."
koreanvariety,3cxnsf,homaki,7,Sun Jul 12 00:16:05 2015 UTC,I think that's why the PDs/writers were so keen to bring Junseok back since they knew he had more potential than he had shown so far. I like that he's not afraid to play the game.
koreanvariety,3cxnsf,sportsteambfan,4,Sun Jul 12 00:34:30 2015 UTC,"Dongmin isn't the type that bosses people around, he leads by gaining trust.  At least that was how he played in s3. We'll see a lot more of Dongmin/Hyunmin a la s3 now I think."
koreanvariety,3cxnsf,joeblitzkrieg,3,Sun Jul 12 00:51:01 2015 UTC,"I think he definitely bosses people around too but he's also shown he has kept his word more often than not so people trust him. More people should be like Junseok where they don't trust him completely because he's shown that he cares more about his inner core alliance than everyone. Last season, he let others died so him and Hyunmin could win. There's nothing wrong with that, it's how the game is supposed to be played but I hope the others don't fall in line with him so quickly. He does have a knack for leadership though."
koreanvariety,3cxnsf,sportsteambfan,3,Thu Jul 16 01:20:19 2015 UTC,We saw JDM and OHM running MMs last season but we also saw the rest of the players singling them out and tryingt o separate them later.  spoiler
koreanvariety,3cxnsf,hwarang,3,Mon Jul 13 04:35:02 2015 UTC,"jinho looked like he's going to go against dongmin, although different MM rules will influence how they go about it. i think having kyunghoon in the game makes it difficult to predict things going forward"
koreanvariety,3cxnsf,joeblitzkrieg,1 point,Mon Jul 13 09:08:41 2015 UTC,"HJH did admit his initial plan was to fly under the radar but I guess he took that DM loss hard, and ended up declaring war on JDM. But really, he didnt have to do much since LSM/KKH drew a huge target on their foreheads.  Spoiler"
koreanvariety,3cxnsf,hwarang,11,Mon Jul 13 14:20:42 2015 UTC,"Sangmin only had that one chance to use that move on the second round. Having everyone bet on the same food item will only happen once in this game and so that was the only time that Sangmin could use the box's secret to his advantage. It's not even a bad move on Sangmin's part. The problem is that Kyunghoon told everyone that he was working with Sangmin, which screwed over Sangmin.  The worst part is that despite being outcasted, Sangmin was still able to come up with plays to guarantee himself to not be last. However, Kyunghoon messed it all up once again by telling the opposite team what their choices were. Sangmin's biggest downfall is not having a reliable person to work with."
koreanvariety,3cxnsf,kyugi0923,2,Wed Jul 15 19:48:54 2015 UTC,"Right, if Kyunghoon didn't tell people, Sangmin could've fed him info for at least one more round which would cement his win and Sangmin gets the other token of life through him. Good move by Sangmin but Kyunghoon kept messing him up."

koreanvariety,3cxnsf,icanteventho,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:12:03 2015 UTC,"It did seem premature, but forcing all vs KKH with LSM playing the mole would have guaranteed them immunity. To me, this feels like a classic LSM power play. Just that KKH is unreliable as you said.  Ive mentioned this before but KKH is like a headless chicken version of Sungkyu. Willing to shake things up (even if he becomes the villian) for the sake of furthering his position in the game. Might have pulled it off if it was Sungkyu and LSM playing off of each other."
koreanvariety,3cxnsf,hwarang,4,Mon Jul 13 17:27:11 2015 UTC,"Exactly my thought. I think if Kyunghoon haven't chicken out and revealed to Dongmin that it was Sangmin's plan, Kyunghoon would have gotten the victory and Sangmin would have done just enough to stay out of last place. But I guess Sangmin like most of us overestimated Kyunghoon's ability to keep things to himself.  I think that's what Sangmin was hoping to use Kyunghoon for this season, like an alternative to Sunggyu. Well this episode taught us to not have too much faith in the strong players because anyone literally can get eliminated lol."
koreanvariety,3cxnsf,homaki,3,Mon Jul 13 17:49:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I was shocked how 1-sided this DM was. But all the players are on the genius for a reason and KKH showed us what hes capable of....imagine playing Gyul Hap with Choi Jungmoon hah."
koreanvariety,3cxnsf,hwarang,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:11:37 2015 UTC,"I'll admit that Sangmin is intelligent and always pulls off big moves. He is also very observant on figuring out the tricks to games and has insane amounts of luck. With all that said, I've been wanting to see him lose after getting such a huge advantage with the token of immortality back in season 2. After that moment (which doohee fucked up for Jinho) Sangmin kept getting wins by default because of the power he wielded and I've been itching to see him lose."

Basically, the general consensus seems to be extreme sympathy for the one who got eliminated, whos now being respected as the 'best player in Genius', and extreme distaste towards the one who eliminated him. And when I say extreme, I mean EXTREME. Like, 206 level of distaste (ok, maybe not THAT much, but close to it)."

koreanvariety,3cxnsf,KnivesMillions,6,Thu Jul 16 02:10:42 2015 UTC,"Felt this way at first for sure but after sitting down and reflecting I hope he stays in for far longer than some of the more boring characters. I'd rather have Kyunghoon making games interesting than having 5 passenger players who just follow the big names. Have never been so gutted at an elimination from reality tv though, massive shame, Sangmin was definitely my favourite by far and I hope to hell we get to see him a couple more times as a guest before the season is over."

koreanvariety,3cxnsf,sundaymorninq,14,Wed Jul 15 20:12:54 2015 UTC,"Agree on one level but not on several others, Sangmin may have less loyalty but he's great for the show. Which other player could have discovered the Hyunmin/Dongmin strategy like that, or make an entire episode turn on its head twice in one season like he has? He mixes things up in ways that players like Jungmoon, Yeonseung and Yoohyun never will, they're nice sure but they don't make for the explosive tv that he does and the show is made considerably worse by his elimination. He for example stops a situation like last season from happening where an alliance basically steamrolled the entire season with more or less zero opposition. It's why I hope the few players left capable of standing up to Dongmin's plans do stay long term, Kyunghoon especially."
koreanvariety,3cxnsf,spritorac,7,Wed Jul 15 20:27:39 2015 UTC,"I agree with the opinion on Sangmin, he made the episode genius and fun"
koreanvariety,3cxnsf,sibtoa,5,Wed Jul 15 21:33:32 2015 UTC,"Yea, you're definitely right there. This episode was so intense precisely because of Sangmin and Kyunghoon's unpredictability combined. I don't know if Kyunghoon can really stand up to Dongmin alone though—he'd have to be assisted by Yoohyun as someone else in this thread has mentioned, and perhaps Jinho/Hyunmin? Dongmin is too good of a player.. unless Kyunghoon just trolls him to death hahaha"
koreanvariety,3cxnsf,sundaymorninq,4,Wed Jul 15 20:37:11 2015 UTC,"How did he know that Kyungran lied? the second time he went to ask Kyungran, she hesitated and reluctant to tell him and then said scissor. Even I would suspect she lied because she and Sangmin are alliance. The result is Kyungran chose something that is not scissor."
koreanvariety,3cxnsf,sibtoa,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:08:19 2015 UTC,Ah that makes sense. I guess I just didn't consider that because I was already surprised that Kyungran would go back to help Sangmin after what he tried to do. Seeing as she was such a close ally of his you'd think she'd feel more betrayed.
koreanvariety,3cxnsf,sundaymorninq,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:16:17 2015 UTC,"After the incident when they talk 1on1 she said she was angry but also understand anyway Sangmin have to do something to get out of the last place. She definitely wanted sangmin to survive, they have long history in SS1 and even on SS4."
koreanvariety,3cxnsf,sibtoa,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:25:10 2015 UTC,I think after this episode Kyunghoon at least can use his unpredictability to his advantage. I wonder if Dongmin will try to eliminate Kyunghoon next bc of Kyunghoon's craziness lol you can kind of see that in this episode when he brought up Kyunghoon's name to Jungmoon.
koreanvariety,3cxnsf,homaki,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:14:51 2015 UTC,"I laughed a bit when you talked about how Sangmin didn't like how nobody was challenging the Hyunmin/Dongmin alliance when in season 2 a similar situation happened with Sangmin. After getting the token, Sangmin become the alliance head and everyone that challenged him was defeated because all the other players were interested in saving themselves and ended up helping the Sangmin alliance."
koreanvariety,3cxnsf,LiterallyKesha,3,Tue Jul 21 21:36:24 2015 UTC,"I hope Jinho doesn't team up with Dongmin and Hyunmin. While I like all 3 players, I would hate to see the dominant 3 team up and run the game. It makes for very boring television. It would also screw Jinho over in the long run since Dongmin and Hyunmin are a lot closer to one another"
koreanvariety,3cxnsf,sportsteambfan,5,Thu Jul 16 02:28:11 2015 UTC,"Hmm I agree with your last point, and thinking about it again I doubt Jinho would stick with them too long even if they had an alliance since Kong knows how close they are anyway. I guess what I meant was that I hope to see them work together as a group or as pairings at some point. But I also doubt that the 3 of them would really dominate the game completely...then again, it's really unpredictable which way the show will go now that Sangmin is out of it."
koreanvariety,3cxnsf,sundaymorninq,2,Thu Jul 16 03:37:16 2015 UTC,"Jinho is not one for fixed alliance so there is little worry in that aspect. I thought occasional teaming up among them sounds like some good gameplay. I initially wanted Jinho and Junseok to pair up sometime in S4 since they did not get to fulfil that in S1E1, but I guess both think on different wavelength and their playing styles seem incompatible. I think breaking into smaller fliud groups could make for great clashes in S4."
koreanvariety,3cxnsf,femacca,2,Thu Jul 16 04:53:04 2015 UTC,"I noticed that about Jinho and Junseok too. I think Jinho clearly wants to work with Junseok but their playing styles are so different as you've said. The main difference between them is how much they're willing to maintain their alliance, I think."
koreanvariety,3cxnsf,sundaymorninq,1 point,Thu Jul 16 05:06:14 2015 UTC,"Well, Jinho said it :D when he is going to the deathmatch, he is dragging Dongmin along"

koreanvariety,3cxnsf,Bananauyu,2,Thu Jul 16 02:12:07 2015 UTC,I think it will be interesting if Jang Dongmin will get eliminated in the next episode so no one can control the other players and to see what the other players can do.
koreanvariety,3cxnsf,nnnneil0929,2,Thu Jul 16 06:47:16 2015 UTC,Wow. Maybe this season we'll finally get a lowkey player winning
koreanvariety,3cxnsf,doubleyouandal,3,Fri Jul 17 08:16:44 2015 UTC,It's Junseok's time.
koreanvariety,3cxnsf,404feelings,2,Fri Jul 17 09:55:51 2015 UTC,"what cracks me up so much is how this guy complains no one trusts him and when he tries to join a team everyone runs away from him but the moment  someone gives him a chance, he completely proves why people do that to him haha  Spoiler alert although at this point if you're here you're here for spoilers anyway.  Sangmin definitely regrets completely helping him out in an earlier episode, it came back to bite him because now the dude just followed him around everywhere then basically singlehandedly led to his elimination"
koreanvariety,3cxnsf,aznanimedude,2,Sat Jul 18 21:51:33 2015 UTC,Im still shaking and getting goosebumps after the final card reveal. This season is so good!
koreanvariety,3cxnsf,blacksiopao,3,Sun Jul 19 15:53:38 2015 UTC,"Since the sub are out I wont use spoiler. My thought on the episode  I feel like this episode could be interesting with the game and box mechanic. Sangmin actually brought this on himself since he was slow to move the box in R1 that made him 0 point. So to get out of the last place he decides to use KH card, then you know what happened after. He pushed other to make a big alliance and he will be the target. In the end he almost get out of it but Junsoek turned to be Jongmoon's hero.  I was a bit sad that sangmin was eliminated even he is not my favorite player, but he made the genius fun with his talk and play. This is one of the episode that I was frustrated because I think it could be more interesting gameplay. So probably not gonna rewatch and rewatch it like other episodes.  Ps. I have to say I like today opening of scary noona lol"
koreanvariety,3cxnsf,sibtoa,3,Wed Jul 15 21:14:25 2015 UTC,"Sangmin is my least favourite among the three champions, but I admire his unorthodox approach to TG. His swapping out of convict card in E1 was such a risky yet brilliant move. He proved how one can turn the tables without having to mindlessly wreck havoc on the games."
koreanvariety,3cxnsf,femacca,4,Thu Jul 16 04:47:56 2015 UTC,"I know how people are lavishing praises over Kyunghoon for his DM performance, and that I give him really huge credit. Sangmin showed why he had to win MMs because he just sucked so bad in DM.  Nevertheless, it is exasperating to see how Kyunghoon messed up the MM games. It would be a neat play and he could cruise his way to become a winner if he kept his mouth shut as well as not give Sangmin away. If he had kept quiet, Sangmin could have secretly pushed him to win before the alliance found out. But no, the King of Troll would not allow himself to do that so he had to go and tell people and the play turned to 9 vs 2. Even if he survived this round, it would be so hard for people to even want to say anything to him at all given his loose lips, and you can't blame people for wanting to outcast him. Sangmin did not (partly forced by circumstances), and it cost him. Jinho being the easy-going one seemed like the most likely person to become his new 'owner' now.  It might be fun for some to see the frustrated expressions on the players, but I find it such a pity that painstakingly designed games were disrupted into such an unplayable manner. It reminded me of S2's disregard for games. I do not agree that the show becomes boring if everybody plays the game properly, because twists to the games can come from individual brilliance and alliance strategy, and do not have to come at an expense of entertainment, like Sangmin swapping out the convict card in E1, Yoonsun's play and Dongmin/Kyungran's neutralisation in E2. Again, this is just me and I fully understand that there are also people who watch this purely for entertainment value. It's just that I needed to vent somewhere, so there."
koreanvariety,3cxnsf,femacca,3,Thu Jul 16 04:43:47 2015 UTC,"Seconding what you said here. It's such a pity because it would've been a perfect play had Sangmin used someone else instead of Kyunghoon.. but that would have also made the episode pretty boring since it would just be the usual ""Sangmin betrays and kills everyone in one fell swoop"". I watch The Genius more for the games and the cast than the entertainment value itself but maaaaan. This episode blows every other one out of the water. I figured S4 would be intense since they're all stars and aren't as naive as before, but this is a whole new level to me."
koreanvariety,3cxnsf,sundaymorninq,1 point,Thu Jul 16 05:10:35 2015 UTC,And I have the same opinion. I feel like the focus was shifted from the gameplay mechanic to something else which is the reason that I felt frustrated in this episosde
koreanvariety,3cxnsf,sibtoa,2,Thu Jul 16 11:04:32 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I had a lot of sympathy for Kyunghoon. Remember, people in this season are some of the best players during these games. Especially with a reputation that Kyunghoon built before, I actually had pity for him when he tried to regain the trust of others. His mistakes were huge screw ups for others, but I feel that pressure of trying not to fail and mess up can be shown in Kyunghoon's behavior. When he was outcasted by other players, I really felt sorry for him, but I'm glad he was able to surprised everyone in the DM."
koreanvariety,3cxnsf,AppleEngi,6,Thu Jul 16 03:28:11 2015 UTC,I wouldn't even have dreamed that he would beat sangmin in a social driven dm like that. It was unbelievable how he kept reading sangmin's moves.  Sangmin probably used all his luck in mm's
koreanvariety,3cxnsf,joeblitzkrieg,6,Thu Jul 16 05:44:47 2015 UTC,I think that he was so exasperated and confused with Kyunghoon from the main games that he lost a read on him.
koreanvariety,3cxnsf,icanteventho,5,Thu Jul 16 06:07:34 2015 UTC,"I don't think if you are one of the players, you should ever have sympathy for Kyunghoon...lol...Sangmin did and look at what happened. I think Kyunghoon is really smart though, he even did that puppy eyed teary thing for the DM."
koreanvariety,3cxnsf,dreamraine,3,Thu Jul 16 05:30:05 2015 UTC,"Pshh, of course. As a player with money at stake, sympathy is out of the question. I'm just saying, as a viewer, I really felt that isolation."
koreanvariety,3cxnsf,AppleEngi,1 point,Thu Jul 16 06:06:06 2015 UTC,"I find yoosun more pitiful though. Kyunghoon has shown himself again and again that you don't want him on your team. . . And I don't buy into his whole clueless act anymore. I mean, if people don't trust you, then you should change right? I dunno,  he wasn't that much of a loose cannon in s3,  either because he left early or he is just pretending to be clueless. Anyway, after every game, the whole cast goes and eats and make merry, so I doubt there are any hard feelings irl ."
koreanvariety,3cxnsf,dreamraine,2,Thu Jul 16 10:07:14 2015 UTC,I'm glad Sangmin left. It's not going to be S2 anymore. Yay.

koreanvariety,3cxnsf,lovingmonday,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:14:11 2015 UTC,Best episode of the season so far. I find it endlessly amusing how Kyunghoon somehow manages to mess up everyone's plans yet again. He has done this for all the episodes so far and it's mindblowing how it's even possible.
koreanvariety,3cxnsf,LiterallyKesha,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:44:38 2015 UTC,"As someone who hated Sangmin in S2 (and was decent on him in S1), I'm devastated to see him go so early. He played brilliantly so far, and without that idiot Kyunghoon he would have pulled off another incredible MM moment. Hiding under the table was fucking genius.   I definitely was weary that he was getting eliminated after they showed him telling Kyunghoon how embarrassing it would be if he lost to him in a DM. FORESHADOWING.   At this point Junseok scares the beejeesus out of me as a potential winner. He's playing really strong right now. Hopefully Hyunmin/Dongmin/Jinho can pull it out. I love seeing winners/strong players do well on All Stars seasons because it's so rare they do well with the massive targets."

koreanvariety,3cxnsf,RaginReap,0,Thu Jul 16 12:35:51 2015 UTC,I agree with what you said about Kyungran. I think the only reason they didn't focus on it much was because it didn't affect the DM in the end. I'm glad Kyunghoon managed to figure it out.

koreanvariety,3cxnsf,joeblitzkrieg,5,Sun Jul 12 03:00:21 2015 UTC,"I don't know the rule of the game yet but I don't think Dongmin was gunning for Jinho at all. Jinho wouldn't have gotten last place anyway since he already have five points. If Dongmin's plan succeed, Sangmin would have five points and tied with Jinho, and last place would have been Jungmoon with 4. And I think Jinho being the person to get the 5-points was random anyway, with Dongmin's plan anyone chosen for the 5-points would have gotten 0 point.  I thought Jinho and Dongmin's rivalry is more of a playful bickering for entertainment purposes than sworn enemies type. They seem much closer to each other than they let on imo. While they don't exactly work together like Hyunmin/Dongmin, they haven't openly target each other either (yet). Sangmin on the other hand I agree in the other seasons, sometimes he like to bring up Jinho's name to the other contestant to pick Jinho for the dm. But I don't think he did anything like that this episode, we would have heard Jinho's name comes up when Sangmin and Dongmin were discussing their strategies but I don't think I heard them mentioning Jinho's name."
koreanvariety,3cxnsf,homaki,2,Sun Jul 12 03:42:40 2015 UTC,"I think Jinho was chosen for the 5-points because he already had 5 points and therefore was safe no matter what, rather than randomly.  If I were a player, from now on I would be trying to make Jinho lose the MM. He's probably the player most willing to pick Dongmin as a DM opponent. I also think that while the female players were safe from being chosen for a DM before this episode, now they won't be."
koreanvariety,3cxnsf,wheybackwhen,3,Sun Jul 12 06:31:11 2015 UTC,"While I don't think any sane player would pick to play against Dongmin after that tactical yutnori showing, if there's a player willing to do it it is jinho. I hope that kind of battle happens later in the season tho, right now it's about how to deal with kingslayer kyunghoon"
koreanvariety,3cxnsf,joeblitzkrieg,2,Sun Jul 12 09:01:43 2015 UTC,"I think so too, out of all the players still in the game, I think only Jinho and Junseok would pick Dongmin if they go into the death match. The female players play the game very safe they wouldn't risk elimination, Dongmin also have alliances with Yeonseung/Hyunmin, Yoohyun also play it very safe, Kyunghoon is a wild card so i don't know lol whatever I predict I'm pretty sure he'll defy my expectations."
koreanvariety,3cxnsf,homaki,4,Sun Jul 12 18:47:54 2015 UTC,"I love what Junseok has brought to the season so far.   I really hope that Jungmoon breaks away a little from now on, given that was the second time the majority alliance almost sent her to the death match."
koreanvariety,3cxnsf,wheybackwhen,3,Sun Jul 12 19:15:28 2015 UTC,"I think Jungmoon should work with one or two people she can trust (ie Junseok) rather than working alone. Most of the Genius games require a person to work with one or two people...unless you've somehow stumble on the twist which most of the time they don't know how to use effectively anyway. The individual based game would only come in later episodes, it's probably not a bad thing for her to work with others right now...but definitely not a good idea to stick with the Hyunmin/Dongmin/Kyungran group tho."

Also, I rewatched and still cannot believe how Dongmin so nearly got away with 'In order to prevent anyone leaking information, I will be in charge of telling everyone how to play' after he was the one who brought it up. Having one person decide was a smart idea, but giving that power to someone who volunteered themselves for it was not."

koreanvariety,3cxnsf,joeblitzkrieg,-3,Sun Jul 12 05:15:22 2015 UTC,"Pretty good episode overall. Junseok's move was a nice twist, which stirred things up, but his intentions were good. Non-dominant characters saving each other adds a nice touch and dynamic to the games, whereas otherwise everyone just would follow Dongmin like sheep.  ... but Kyunghoon is the biggest idiot I've ever seen. I didn't know people could be this dense. Does he even think before speaking, sharing with everyone his strategy when he's obviously in a team? Even though he won, I don't think he even knows what he did in the DM. His last move, assuming he thought it would be scissors, was the worst move one could make. I sincerely hope he is the next one to leave, no one can pull of anything off with such a fool running around. Although some may like the random element, I'd rather see Sangmin pull of more stunts for 8 episodes than Kyunghoon making a total fool of himself for the rest of the season."
koreanvariety,3cxnsf,Giiiraffe,6,Fri Jul 17 04:27:05 2015 UTC,"Kyunghoon may have made many terrible moves in the MM, but he did great in the DM, so let's give credit where it's due."

koreanvariety,3cz379,Rhunyn,4,Sun Jul 12 03:33:02 2015 UTC,Some watches o WGM believe that EVERYTHING on WGM is scripted from the lines they say to how they act. I'm one to think that the places where they meet and situations might be scripted but how they react and say - that's all up to the celebrities. I also believe that the show takes in suggestions of the celebrities and make them happen if they feel it'll help the show.   Those that believe that EVERYTHING is scripted have to realize just how tough something like that is mostly if that person has zero acting experience which many celebrities that come on there don't.
koreanvariety,3cz379,Hitokiri2,4,Sun Jul 12 12:54:44 2015 UTC,"I think the most scripted it gets is whenever they go out ""for a surprise"" or say ""I prepared this beforehand"". The small interactions and most dialogue I believe to be real between the couples. That being said, I like how Sungjae and Joy are so awkward because that's how you can tell it's real."
koreanvariety,3cz379,Rhunyn,2,Sun Jul 12 15:21:20 2015 UTC,"My favorite thing in this show is: Joy is so honest! And she expresses her care without even being shy. Sungjae is the shy one hahahahahah  And yeah, their chemistry is really good! <3"
koreanvariety,3cz379,Rhunyn,1 point,Sun Jul 12 03:45:52 2015 UTC,"Right! I actually really like that whenever they talk they're both embarrassed, because the reality of the show is that it's awkward.

koreanvariety,3cz379,_Dantes_Inporno_,1 point,Sun Jul 12 06:18:53 2015 UTC,Spot on. Usually the couples who have been celebrities for awhile know how to blend the scripted parts and unscripted parts. However since they're both kinda young and a bit awkward they're still pretty obvious and it's easier to tell at times which ones which (unless that's part of they're plan)

koreanvariety,3cvyfo,Enter_Text_Here,-7,Sun Jul 12 01:59:49 2015 UTC,"The first Yoomes Bond episode sucks so bad. It was one of those episodes that is just blatantly scripted. There was no mission for the RM members to do and just walked around so that YJS can ""secretly"" hit their nametags with that tiny water gun. There was even a scene where gary felt the water hit him and he commented ""oh is it raining?"". Holy shit. It's a good thing that those were the worst periods of RM. After that, the quality of the episodes improved. Better games were introduced. Less blatant scripting of episodes were used."
koreanvariety,3cvyfo,themadbat,9,Sat Jul 11 16:09:06 2015 UTC,"I cant prove that it is not scripted but at that time a team betrayal of such magnitude had not happened so nobody was expecting anything at all. This explains a lot of their behavior. Honestly, I watched this several times and never felt it was scripted, instead it felt real and their emotions were relatable. The episode became a success and thats why they developed this into a series, it was not planed in advance."
koreanvariety,3cvyfo,0moe,-4,Sat Jul 11 17:16:03 2015 UTC,"Gary was having fun with the fact that it is scripted, thus the ""is it raining"" comment he made out of the blue. Even if it was not scripted, the entire premise was done really poorly from a game standpoint. Getting eliminated by a traitor that you had no idea existed, using a means that is also secret, is not exciting in any way, shape, or form. Even the means of eliminating people, using a tiny weenie water gun, isn't even entertaining.   Edit: To clarify, I am not mad that it is scripted. I am mad because it is scripted really poorly."
koreanvariety,3cvyfo,themadbat,3,Sat Jul 11 18:05:36 2015 UTC,"That was the whole fun of it. He (YJS) had to secretly eliminate the other members, so it made sense that he used a tiny water pistol."
koreanvariety,3cvyfo,Enter_Text_Here,-2,Sat Jul 11 18:25:34 2015 UTC,"Again, getting eliminated by a traitor that you had no idea existed, using a means that is also secret, is not exciting in any way, shape, or form.  There is no tension. The members don't know he's a spy. The members don't know they can be eliminated by a water gun. Being eliminated by a water gun isn't even entertaining (as compared to say, getting hit in the head with a toy hammer as means of elimination or something ridiculous). Failing at something entertainingly is a lot better than winning at something boringly."

koreanvariety,3cq0jr,Hitokiri2,1 point,Fri Jul 10 14:57:28 2015 UTC,It's sort of mysterious to me but I wonder why YJS is all the sudden working so hard to find new shows all the sudden. Ever since Family Outing he's been pretty steady in his shows and even though a few got cancelled it's not like his money or popularity took a hit.   I think YJS is really trying to find the next new thing and I think he thinks its found in talks shows thus why so many of his new formats are talk show based. I also believe YJS sees cable TV as his final and last destination. There's an ongoing joke that YJS is the king of regular network TV in South Korea which means he doesn't get the same respect on cable. I think he's trying to break through this this project on JTBC.
koreanvariety,3cq0jr,InfamousMike,4,Fri Jul 10 15:00:48 2015 UTC,"I don't think its that. YJS always seems to like having a talk show under his belt.

koreanvariety,3covm5,breakingfree,10,Thu Jul 9 16:15:46 2015 UTC,"I'm probably just trying to find a way to justify viewing a large amount of Korean tv shows, but I feel like there's a difference between mindlessly watching TV and being able to watch a show whenever I want. Most people I know will watch TV even if they can't find anything they are interested in."
koreanvariety,3covm5,mthrow_,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:37:16 2015 UTC,"We actually got in a bit of an argument because of this, because I said that I don't find there to be any difference, that it's watching media and is passive in both situations. She told me that she still doesn't consider what she's doing as ""watching TV"" because it's on computer and she can pause and do other stuff or multitask besides. And when I told her that i think it's even worse that she can't concentrate enough to watch a show in one piece through the end she just told me to piss off and that i'm looking for problems where there aren't any.   I'm really not sure whether she's in denial or whether she's right and I'm just projecting my own addiction onto others."
koreanvariety,3covm5,Supplycrate,3,Thu Jul 9 19:18:06 2015 UTC,"You're right, in my opinion. I watch varieties/dramas streamed to my living room TV using an Amazon Fire, which can be paused, and I've got a tablet sitting next to me so I could multitask answering emails or whatever. If I were watching the same exact thing on my PC there's not really any difference. I'd describe both as ""watching TV"" because those are television shows I'm watching, even if I'm watching them on demand instead of on broadcast.   If anything I think it's easier to go overboard with on demand viewing than traditional broadcast TV. I'd never sit and watch 4 hours of broadcast because the ads would drive me to distraction, and there'd never be that much concurrent programming of interest to me. But if I'm in control of the programming and there's no ads I can easily sit and watch for 4 hours or longer (assuming I have nothing else to do, obviously)."
koreanvariety,3covm5,0moe,11,Thu Jul 9 19:56:55 2015 UTC,"Even though I occasionally watch variety, it doesnt feel like watching TV at all because I can watch it anytime and without advertising and those two are key characteristics of television (at least where I live).

I don't think the act of watching TV or watching the laptop has any difference....they are both harmful for long periods and makes me a couch/bed potato....And yes, I watch too much shows although I always tell myself to cut down and go and interact with people more or exercise...."

koreanvariety,3covm5,nighoblivion,5,Fri Jul 10 03:30:17 2015 UTC,"This is more a definition problem of the internet age.  If you're watching a TV broadcast, you're watching TV.  If you consume your media online through the screen you call a TV hooked up to a computer while sitting in a sofa, you're not watching TV."
koreanvariety,3covm5,HealerKeeper,2,Thu Jul 9 17:27:34 2015 UTC,"The question seems like: Is there a difference between watching on a tv screen or a pc screen. The answer is no.  But if the question is, real tv vs on demand then:  I would define ""to much"" as when you let something important slide or reject meeting with friends because you ""need to watch xyz"". And this is way easier with TV then if you are watching on demand. If you watch a show on tv you can't just say: oh yeah, lets go out I will watch it tomorrow. If you waste a day watching a complete drama because there is nothing to do I think its not so problematic, but when you occupy 2 evenings a week for 2 month because you need to watch it on tv, you got a huge problem with your media consumption.  Im a huge fan of some variety shows, watch every episode, but i never said once: no i have no time, i have to watch it. If I have something important to do I can wait till I have time to watch it"
koreanvariety,3covm5,femacca,2,Thu Jul 9 17:42:05 2015 UTC,"I know for sure I watch more TV than average. It doesn't matter whether you watch it from a proper TV set or computer monitor; it's still considered TV - just a difference in platform, as opposed to say, music, newspapers, books etc.   I agree about the multi-tasking part when doing so on PC. I usually open two or more windows, with one of it playing video and the others doing stuff like reading news, checking mails, etc. I dream of having a set-up like L watching surveillance cameras in Death Note."
koreanvariety,3covm5,Hitokiri2,2,Thu Jul 9 23:23:48 2015 UTC,"I asked a similar question a few weeks back. I asked if watching variety shows made a person watch less TV or less TV shows from their own country.   Personally the only things I watch on TV anymore is sports - that's basically it. I might watch the news, a movie on TV, and the National Geographic channel every once and a while but besides that there's nothing on TV that interest me.   Most of my ""TV"" is in another language and I watch it online. That's my life and I'm not ashamed to tell others that and have been telling others that for years."

koreanvariety,3cisuj,i_love_all,3,Wed Jul 8 06:15:14 2015 UTC,Im LOVING this sport. they are all working hard and succeeding although hyungdon was extremely tired.  i cant wait to see the end of this sport to see how much these guys physique has changed.   the cast is amazing too. they all love cycling and are new fun people. i recommend people to watch along for this sport!
koreanvariety,3cisuj,Hyperion98,3,Wed Jul 8 06:16:31 2015 UTC,Haven't watched the show since Hyungdon started co-mcing with Hodong. Do they work well together? They have quite similar styles so it may be a bit messy.

BUT this cast for cycling is amazing and so is the sport so i recommend watching"
koreanvariety,3cisuj,RaginReap,3,Wed Jul 8 06:42:04 2015 UTC,"I like Hyungdon a lot as well (dedicated MuDo fan) but I was worried he and Hodong wouldn't gel well because they have the same self-deprecating humour and sometimes get loud and overbearing; like Hyungdon on Weekly Idol when he completely overshadows Deffcon.  Seems like from what you say that Hodong is still taking the reigns and Hyungdon is doing what he always does in shows with a bigger mc (i.e. his role in MuDo). Unfortunate because Hodong needs a co-mc that controls him more and prevents the show from going off course. Someone like YJS, Lee Soogeun or even Seunggi."

They physically remove the refrigerators from celebrities' homes and transport it to the studio. The guests present two different types of dishes they wish to eat. Then professional and amateur chefs do two 1v1 cooking battles using stuff in the fridge. Sometimes idols guest on the show. SNSD's Sunny and Infinite's Sungkyu were guests in a recent episode.  tvN's Mr. Baek The Homemade Food Master (집밥 백선생). Chef Baek Jong-won's cooking show. It's pretty popular. There's a bunch of celebrities part of the cast, but not idols. They don't bring in guests or anything like that. This show doesn't get subbed.  KBS's Human Condition Season 3 (인간의 조건 - 도시농부). They are doing rooftop urban farming (literally building a farm on a rooftop). Two of the cast member are chefs (Jung Chang-wook and Choi Hyun-seok). They do a bit of cooking each episode using the stuff that grow. Most of the focus is on the farming aspect. This show gets subbed on KBS World.  KBS's 1 Night 2 Days has done a few trips that heavily revolved around cooking/food. The ones in bold had celebrity/professional chefs as guests. Also, every single 1N2D trip involves eating at some point.    Jeollanam-do great food tour - parts 1, 2 The Best Autumn Meal -  parts 1, 2 Korean Cuisine and Three Meals - parts 1. 2 Best Meal With a Drink - parts 1, 2, 3   MBC's My Little Television (마이 리틀 텔레비전).

koreanvariety,3cj4ul,ginastringr,3,Wed Jul 8 11:51:32 2015 UTC,"You might enjoy ""The King of Food""  They have celeb guests on to learn about different types of Korean cuisine. Each episode has a new theme.  The guests (two teams) have to answer questions about the food correctly in order to eat it. Then they watch a quick mini-doc on that food's history and prep while they eat.   {all links are to: http://kshowonline.com pages}  Three Meals A Day is just as amazing because of the people who are in it, as well as the amazing food they grow, harvest, prep and coo  An older show (but still stands as one of the best Korean Variety shows ever....EVER) is Family Outing which features 7 regulars and a weekly guest(s) as they ""house sit"" in a different rural village each episode.  Among other things, they have to harvest and prepare each meal from the area, usually in an outside kitchen area.  The magic of the show is the total honest and un-pretentiousness of the entire group of A-list celebs as they interact with each other and the challanges of getting through the weekend.  Also it teaches you the power of a small foil seasoning packet.  Family Outing (season 1 at least as they changed the entire cast for season two) is hands down my all time favorite, Yoo Jae Suk hit his stride during the Family Outing episodes and IMHO its this show which cemented his Korea's favorite MC."

That being said though there are some Running Man specials that also have the detective/criminal scenario, as well as Infinity Challenge episodes focused on a court case (Gil vs Jaesuk).   King of Mask Singer, while not all that similar, also has the whole ""guess along with the judges"" theme. It's a variety show where a bunch of people, usually famous not necessarily singers, go head to head. The catch is they're wearing masks so the judging is unbiased. Again, not an exact fit but could be interesting.   I Can Hear Your Voice is another singing one, this time the goal is to figure out which contestant out of a lineup is actually a good singer and which ones aren't. Guest judges are given small clues (Really short voice samples, lip syncing segments etc.) to decide who to keep and who to eliminate and the last one standing sings a piece with the guest. If the guest was wrong, they have to sing with someone who's tonedeaf."

I could be wrong because I dropped it after a few episodes but I felt that the focus shifted way too much on the social aspect of the game rather than the problem solving that drove me to like it in the first place. It became a story of betrayal rather than trying to solve the puzzle. Fortunately by the time I had discovered the genius, season 3 was already out so I just skipped season 2. I find season 3 to be more approachable in terms of the fact that I understand the strategies of the players now. Its still not as good as season 1, and there are some alliances, but better than season 2 in my book"

koreanvariety,3cepz7,ikkasaaaan,2,Tue Jul 7 09:42:34 2015 UTC,I think there's a lot of confusion because of the editing done by the pds. My thoughts are that Yuri either found out that the cube spelt Yoona but not fully understanding what it meant or that she was guessing possible words and they just edited it into looking like she solved it. Both of these possibilities explain why Yuri didn't rip off Yoona's name tag when she had the chance and why she was confused as to why the gatekeepers didn't go after Yoona.
koreanvariety,3cepz7,Jaeyang,1 point,Tue Jul 7 10:40:33 2015 UTC,"i agree this is possible too. it's pretty confusing and they didn't mention whether angel code was already determined secretly and sort of ""fixed"" in the beginning so yoona couldn't be eliminated or the cube was the thing that ""activated"" yoona to become the angel code.   it's just that there are so many people saying that the game is so unfair because yoona couldn't be ousted at all so she was sure to win. but i was trying to make a point that maybe she could be ousted just that she has to not realize that she is angel code or something."
koreanvariety,3cepz7,concreteroads,7,Tue Jul 7 10:46:40 2015 UTC,"I thought it was just bad planning on the PDs' part, plus good strategy from the chasing team. Choi Hong-man looks and sounds like a giant bear, but if you consider his chasing strategy, it was actually pretty smart-- he pulled the classic RM pincer move on the escalator; he figured out that there had to be somebody hiding in the change room; and when he realized that it was down to the last moments of the game, he returned himself to patrolling the 1st floor so that it was almost impossible for the mission teams to win. To be honest, even without the Angel Code, the moment Haha resigned himself to being Min-ho bait and threw the barcodes down to the first floor, his team (who I cheered for the whole time) was screwed.  I said this in the main discussion thread, but I thought the Reflect ability was way too strong. Yoona was basically a Spy like RM has had before... but the Spy should be panicky and stressed the whole time lol, not wandering around with nothing to do because her job is basically done for her. It's fine if the chasers don't attack her, but there should've been a way for the mission teams to get her out or else it would've been too OP. Like once they solved the Rubik's Cube, they should've been told they could rip Angel Code's nametag, or there could've been two hints-- one saying who the AC was and one telling them how to get her out.   In the end, I think the only way Mission Team could've won (outside of just being faster, I guess, and beating Yoona to the Rubik's Cube) was if Haha had waited to play the hero. It would've been hard for him to escape Min-ho, but if he managed run down to the first floor to serve as Hong-man fodder, that might've distracted the giant long enough for Yuri to make a break for it. Although I was practically yelling at my screen ""c'mon Yuri, don't trust Yoona!"", even if she hadn't mistakenly trusted Yoona to be a decoy, she would've lost anyways because the chaser would've gotten her in seconds."
koreanvariety,3cepz7,stupidtat,8,Tue Jul 7 13:31:07 2015 UTC,"IMO the rule of the game is quite bad already, although there are 15 people(SNSD + RM), there are 22 people chasing, and there are not way to stop/pause the chasing team. WTF? They should have some ways to stop/pause the chasing either by removing their name tag from their back or other things(E.g. find some game item in the mall?Its a game right?) so they will have a time period to focus on finding the bar code.  Also, either they don't explain clearly or they edit the part out, the member are clearly don't have a cue about Angle Code and the Cube. They didn't tell them(Or they had but didn't show it) that the cube will tell who the angle code is. That's why when Yuri solve the cube and know its about Yoona, she don't know she should rip Yoona name tag to prevent her from winning(Not that it will work as it will reflect), you can clearly see that Yuri was trying to use Yoona as bait for Hong-man so that she can collect the bar code HaHa threw. PD should have told them more clearly about the rule about Angle Code(E.g. Chasing team don't attack the Angle Code) and the cube.  After all I think this part is the least ""fun"" part of the ep, they should have separate the ep into a two part special. When I got to the chasing I was like ""That's the final game already?It was so fast!"". The last SNSD EP are better than this one because RM and SNSD have more interaction(Talking on cars/during the game) and  there are more spare time when it was separated. There are so many interesting moment in the trailer were edited out in the broadcast(E.g. Yuri team in the mud flat, Taeyeon Kick)"
koreanvariety,3cepz7,concreteroads,1 point,Tue Jul 7 14:18:47 2015 UTC,"I liked the one episode nature (the dual episode specials sometimes drag on too long). But yeah I agree with you, the rules of the final game were pretty iffy.   The chasers weren't too bad, I thought. I mean technically there's like 20 people, but the 3rd floor group guards move as 1 unit and they only caught one person, so it wasn't that bad. Also for much of the game, the chasers were confined to their own sections so at least they thought about some kind of limitation. I agree some kind of freeze/escape mechanism would've helped make it more interesting. The bar code finding was easier than I expected though. Haha's team only had two hints but they somehow managed to find two barcodes with no hints at all. So I assume multiples of each code were placed around the building.   The members knew the Cube = Angel Code so that wasn't the problem, I think the issue was that the PDs didn't make a way for the Angel Code to not win. Yuri was at a dead end no matter what-- if she ripped Yoona's nametag, she was dead. If she assumed Yoona could serve as bait, she was wrong and Angel Code won. If she tried to make a run for it herself, she would've been caught by Choi Hong-man instantly.   I actually liked this episode better than past SNSD episodes though. I liked that all members got some good screen time, the games were funny, and it wasn't as couples-oriented. It was also great to see some more of members we've never seen/barely saw before! Soo-young and Sunny were a lot of fun."
koreanvariety,3cepz7,stupidtat,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:33:49 2015 UTC,"Well...Yes the 20 people group were moving as 1 unit, but they don't chase at the same speed.If wasn't there is a guard run so fast, Ji-hyo would have been able to get away(So I think). And yes I think the confinement was great until they break it after they find the cube, I think the confinement should stay until one of the team find all of the four bar code. Yes there must be multiple copies of the same code or else no team will be able to collect all of the bar code without fighting with other team(Which I think the third game should be them fighting for the bar code instead of having bring extra guest to chase them).  No,they was not told Cube = Angel (Maybe they did be it was not shown, It was Gary who relate the Cube to Angel Code when Yoona find the cube by accident), their initial briefing about the rule(That were shown) haven't mention anything about the Cube. And they were only told the Angel Code will prevent them from exiting(Winning). The rule were only explained to Yoona when she found out the cube was about her.   I think the concept of Angel Code is ok, but the reflect ability was just too OP. I think Yuri lose it already when Haha throw the bar code to the ground floor, there are no teammate to distract Hong-man from her to collect the bar code, Hong-man can easily prevent  her from collecting the bar code.   I think the best part of this episode is Sooyoung talk her way out of being finished. I laughed so hard for that two parts and it were very memorable. Yet I still prefer the past SNSD episode more, there are more chemistry between the RM and SNSD, the part when they go to supermarket for dinner material was so funny I watch that part over and over again and I will still laugh my ass off sometime."
koreanvariety,3cepz7,concreteroads,1 point,Tue Jul 7 19:12:13 2015 UTC,"I don't think they were explicitly told Cube = Angel Code, but I'm pretty sure they all knew the Cube gave the hint for the code, since they talked about in their conversations. Both Gary and Yuri talked about having the Angel clue, so I think they probably figured out why there were mystery Rubik's Cubes lying around.   What they didn't tell was the fact that Angel Code is invincible to chasers, and that was the part that was more unfair.   And yeah Soo-young's persuasion was adorably hilarious! It's probably just a matter of personal preference, I tend to like physical games more and there was definitely a lot of that this episode. I think I just frequently don't like couple races because we get a lot of the same old pairings and same old concepts re-hashed, which is why I'm personally not a fan of the previous SNSD special (although I know a lot of people liked it)."
koreanvariety,3cepz7,JKSciFi,3,Tue Jul 7 20:44:52 2015 UTC,"I don't know how many times I said this, but the AC DIDN'T HAVE A REFLECT ABILITY. It was just poor wording with the subtitles. The only ability she had was immunity from the chasers. The other members could have very easily found out that she was AC before she realised it herself, and just ripped her name tag. There, she's dead. I don't get where this whole 'Reflect' thing started, but I assure you, she DIDN'T HAVE A REFLECT ABILITY."

koreanvariety,3cepz7,Purplestackz,2,Tue Jul 7 11:39:08 2015 UTC,"i believe almost if not all variety shows are scripted lol it just depends to what extend it is scripted to. like the games are certainly scripted since they are prepared but i dont think dialogues are besides those acting/reactions/drama they created in the beginning for the introduction normally for rm  Edit: I don't really think the winner of every game is scripted as well. In ep 254 I think yoona is sort of like a ""spy"" but not quite since she wasn't informed earlier before the show"

koreanvariety,3cepz7,stupidtat,3,Wed Jul 8 02:21:10 2015 UTC,"I think i'm more worried about Seo Hyun in this episode..  She start out really fine, and then suddenly disappeared when the 2nd Tetris round start.. Well to cover that up, Jong Kook and Taeyon didn't get any significant highlight, at all.. Did anyone notice?  And then she re-appear on the final game, with that little mask. Hope she's okay, though.. Honestly, even i understand that shooting this variety is super super super tiring and need a lot of physical readiness.."
koreanvariety,3cepz7,holyarmy,2,Tue Jul 7 13:20:47 2015 UTC,Yeah in fact I don't think Jong kook has any airtime during final mission until it was his turn to get eliminated by choi hong man and min ho.
koreanvariety,3cepz7,RedAxis,1 point,Tue Jul 7 13:25:15 2015 UTC,they must have edit most of the airtime from pink team to cover up the injury of SeoHyun
koreanvariety,3cepz7,jsrave,1 point,Tue Jul 7 19:13:15 2015 UTC,"Yeah, because they want to make sure that no one notice that SeoHyun isn't at her best condition when they shoot, i guess..  And to edit that out, they might need to make some compromise.."
koreanvariety,3cepz7,holyarmy,0,Tue Jul 7 13:28:15 2015 UTC,"Most likely because he didn't do enough significant things to warrant a ""threat"" to finishing the mission like Haha did. No point in building any type of story with him if he's not going to do anything for the mission. Plus, he does have his tendency to get zero airtime in these situations, either because his methods of ambushing might go to waste or his injury might force him to slow down and thus, not contribute as much, leaving him with little airtime."
koreanvariety,3cepz7,Scepter_ZA,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:39:41 2015 UTC,She had a small facial injury that stopped her from being in the rest of the game. She said later through sns that it wasn't too big of a deal.

koreanvariety,3cepz7,TheNewRobberBaron,2,Tue Jul 7 14:33:52 2015 UTC,"I've watched the episode with DramaFever subs and there is no mention of the reflect ability at all. From what I gather, this reflect ability is mentioned in the KSN subs, which are translated in to English from Chinese fan subs.   I trust the DF subs more, which go from Korean to English in a little over 24 hours as opposed to the KSN subs which go from Korean to Chinese to English, encoded and uploaded in around 20 hours. I don't think the reflect ability is in the game at all, Yoona was just invulnerable from the chasers, and any of the other RM or SNSD members could have eliminated her if they wanted."
koreanvariety,3cepz7,PurpleKhezu,2,Tue Jul 7 15:34:34 2015 UTC,Same. I watched the Dramafever version only and I didn't see any mention of the reflect ability. Can someone post a screencap of the other version that mentions it?
koreanvariety,3cepz7,Keadis,4,Tue Jul 7 16:40:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah I'm Korean, and there was no ""reflect"" ability. Yoona essentially was guaranteed to win once she figured out that the people wouldn't touch her. It was just a matter of waiting for her to figure the game out."
koreanvariety,3cepz7,aznanimedude,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:52:36 2015 UTC,"It just the RM+SNSD doing minigames, no drama, less silly or funny interaction between either the RM's itself or RM and SNSD member. I was hoping at least it would be as entertaining as the first SNSD episode (63-64).  And the final games is so disappointing, invisible giant, motorbike human, troop of masked pervert with no way to defeat at each floor, chasing and run them out 1 by 1 with lastly Yoona as sole winner cause she is the Angel Code, no fun."
koreanvariety,3cepz7,SpCommander,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:34:37 2015 UTC,The end was a bit screwed for me when that Min ho guy showed up. Suddenly the show changed its focus to him and how amazing he is...
koreanvariety,3cepz7,RedAxis,1 point,Sat Jul 11 16:45:45 2015 UTC,"the game rules could have been done a lot better but also at the same time, the Angel Code was as strong as it was at that point because they discovered who it was so late into the final mission.  If they had figured it out earlier it would have been a completely different situation.  I agree with people saying there should be a way to somehow freeze each floor's chaser or at least keep them confined even more to their floors.  Either way MinHo was far too serious lol, he should have pulled a Choi Min Soo and catch them multiple times but be like ""i'll let you go for now, since i can just catch you again later"", especially since he couldn't have been ousted anyway."

koreanvariety,3c9fc9,amelisa28,1 point,Mon Jul 6 21:57:18 2015 UTC,"In one way, it's been a while since JH and SJ had last been paired up by themselves for the entire episode, since the last time had been in ep 224/Dec 2014 (and game-wise, they had been paired up for the karaoke round in 240/March 2015). They also had a dynamic specific to only them and maybe the show will properly spotlight it this time.   However, I can't help but feel the same way as you because of how they had been paired up far too often in the past, and not for any reasons that would benefit them since they ended up being sacrificial lambs with regard to screentime. It seemed like in the beginning of the year, when SJ's variety skills were displayed in a new light, the RM crew finally took a chance to pair him up with the guests again, and it seemed to work out too. But the return of the SJ/JH pairing feels fishy considering the game results for SJ's pairing in last week's episode/ep 243. The fact that they were also able to easily return to their bad habit of majorly cutting JH out in 244, rather than incorporating her in more to make up for her absence in eps 63 & 64, also makes me even more skeptical about their intentions for the coming episode.   Actually, I just realized, considering how JH will likely be given more screentime than usual for the 2PM episode, I wonder if the the PD/writers have some kind of personal quota as to how creative/different they should be before they can slack off and return to their usual habits. Like, ""Oh, we did something different this week. Phew, now we can go back to the routine format for several weeks."" And tada: this week. Granted I did hear that there will be something different done with the distribution of the pairings in one game, which is good news, and there's the slight random chance the episode may handle the issue with screentime better. But it's all unfortunately doubtful due to the show's lack of consistency, especially since it's not uncommon for episodes to have something with potential but not have it executed properly.   I still constantly hope that I will be proven wrong each week, but I'm so not here for the PD/writing & editing team's mindset of assuming the current quality of certain episodes is good enough for them to put even less effort into the ones in between."
koreanvariety,3c9fc9,concreteroads,3,Tue Jul 7 00:24:28 2015 UTC,"I think you're right and Ji-hyo will definitely get some nice screen time when the 2PM boys come. Especially since a lot of them are quite comfortable in variety, and she has a great rapport with them from past CFs and stuff.   I also agree, Ji-hyo and Suk-jin have a really fun, special rapport; the two of them really exemplify the Running Man 'family' spirit when they're given the chance to do their own thing. But putting them together repeatedly wastes both of their unique talents. I do love Ji-hyo, but I think anyone could admit that she's not the most straightforward verbally witty of the crew, so Suk-jin's awesome ad libs are wasted on her (actually, for whatever reason, he usually doesn't try them at all). And Ji-hyo has enough fighting spirit and game sense to drag almost any other partner through to victory or at least close in a well set-up race, but Race Start Suk-jin is usually just too much even for the legendary SpartAce combo lol. Also even when they're not a straight up couple, the PDs still like pairing them together in a 3-man team (and whatever guest they're with often suffers for it), e.g. in the most recent SNSD episode.  I agree, while the cast is consistently fantastic, and improving over the years, the PD team (both in terms of game structure and editing) has huge ups and downs. I think unfortunately, they feel the ratings pressure to keep a balance between 'tried-and-true' type episodes and set ups and the ones where they're trying something new."

koreanvariety,3c9fc9,ThunderRice,2,Mon Jul 6 07:12:53 2015 UTC,"My Korean classmate told me to watch Infinite Challenge, we can both start it I guess."

koreanvariety,3c9fc9,alastoris,2,Mon Jul 6 20:10:00 2015 UTC,"Unless they're doing a special event, no guest. Guest don't get invited weekly. They get called up or home invasion in Kim JeDong's case.   IC also has no set structure. Their name, Infinity Challenge, is exactly what they do. They take on challenge, and do their best to complete it while throwing gags here and there. Memorable ones are My ______ Buddy. Where they find people they know that shares a certain characteristic (They've done Lonely and Ugly) and they just spend couple hours together having fun playing minigames, comforting each other, and selecting who's the ______ ugliest/loneliest  Another memorable one would be extreme jobs. This is where they take on odd jobs people do for a living. Very interesting epd, it's not a VERY funny epd, but I'd recommend it for people to watch to get a feel on what IC is about.   They're about to start their music festival. Where they'd partner up with singers and come up with a whole new song for their concert. I think the idea started this week.   Oh about IC, ideas gets carried on from 1 epd to the next. Sometime in span of 4 - 5 epd (6th man, where they spend 5 epd interviewing and selecting candidates). Some are short term where it's done in 2 - 3 epd and some are long term. You'll see an epd on it, and it won't come back till after a couple more epd."
koreanvariety,3c9fc9,CounterLegend,1 point,Wed Jul 8 06:10:47 2015 UTC,Ah thanks so much! So would you recommend starting from the beginning seeming as the episodes may continue on from one another?
koreanvariety,3c9fc9,alastoris,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:45:32 2015 UTC,"IC is a program that has been on for 10 years. Since it was mainly popular in Korea without much idols, majority of the earlier epd s are not subbed. Kshowonline has a good category of what they have.   http://kshowonline.com/kshow/1903-[engsub]-infinity-challenge-(full)  I can't recommend a place to start but as you go through the list, find concept you think would be interesting and give it a go.   My recommendations are:   Introducing My Ugly Friends (304 - 306) Ep 340 The Famous 7 Princesses  Introducing My Lonely Friend EP 359(second half) - 362 Ep 390 Summer Party, Midnight In Seoul Special Ep 392 + 393 The Thieves Special Ep 391 The Heat Wave Era Special  Ep 406/407 EXTREME PART TIME JOB! Ep 412 Horror special (REALLY good if you enjoy people getting scared) I think it was 207, but one epd they were tricked by the PD thinking they were going to Thailand for vacation but they stayed in Korea. There was also 1 more, where they were starved by the Production team for an entire day and they were then locked up in cells and have to play mini games to get food. If they lose, they have to watch people eat said food. Another one I thought of just now is when they were locked up in cells and had to play games. Each time they lose, their cell will get uncomfortably smaller. Last man standing wins."

koreanvariety,3c8p8c,mkatter,9,Sun Jul 5 23:09:16 2015 UTC,"Looking great!   Celebrity chefs and cooking shows continue to be the trend.   tvN Mr. Baek The Homemade Food Master (집밥 백선생) hauls in a 6.312% rating in its 7th episode. The show started off at 2.156%. You may know chef Baek Jong-won from My Little Television. tvN Three Meals a Day beats Law of the Jungle for the first time with a 11.99% rating.  A special episode of Take Care of My Refrigerator that consisted of only old clips got a 1.617% rating, which was higher than Crime Scene 2's finale of 1.536%.  Mnet Show Me The Money 4 starts off on the right foot, going 1.548% and 1.756% in its first two episodes.    Season 3's best rating was a 1.436%.  KBS's Saturday night shows receive boosts in ratings due to rescheduling.    Entertainment Weekly moves into The Producers's old spot, getting a 1.6% boost and beating SBS Same Bed, Different Dreams. This move is permanent. Human Condition 3 moved from 11:30 PM to 10:25 PM, boosting its ratings from 2.9% to 5.0%. It will move back to 11:30 PM next week to make room for Youth FC (청춘FC)'s first episode.  MBC King of Mask Singer continues its rise. 13.1% is its best rating to date. It closes its gap with Return of Superman to 1.0%, while building an 8.3% buffer against Take Care of My Dad. KBS 1 Night 2 Days's first episode after its female friend special got a 15.8%, a 2.2% drop from last week. However, it is 2.6% higher than what it got 4 weeks ago, before the special.    Hmmm...   MBC We Got Married fell to 3.8% while Oh My Baby rose to 7.2%. WGM failed to capitalize on its boosted viewership when Oh My Baby was cancelled on June 20. In addition, the new couples haven't made a big impact so far. SBS Running Man fails to reach double digits (9.7%) despite Girls' Generation. The episode gave RM a boost of 1.7%. The 2.5% gap with Real Men shrank to 1.2%. Three weeks ago, Running Man was at a healthy 11.0%.    1 Night 2 Days retained more than half of the boost it received from its special so the same could be expected for Running Man.   SBS Take Care of My Dad drops from 6.0% to 4.8%, failing to synergize with Running Man's Girls' Generation special. (But then again, has Take Care of My Dad ever helped Running Man?)   Cast changes/news   SBS Healing Camp shakes things up as it nears its 4th year anniversary. MCs Lee Kyung-kyu and Sung-Yuri step down from the show, leaving Kim Jae-dong as the sole MC. There will be format changes as well, hoping to revitalize the show. The show hit hard times recently, going as low as 3.4%. In its heyday, its ratings went as high as 18.7%. JTBC Abnormal Summit will introduce its new members next episode. JTBC Take Care of My Refrigerator was embroiled in a controversy for several weeks due to chef Maeng Ki-yong. The chef was criticized for his incompetence and substandard dishes despite being a professional chef. A lot of his dishes he presented on shows outside of ""Refrigerator"" were also criticized. He also plagairized a recipe and presented it as his own. The show's producers shielded the chef and avoided the issue for weeks. Maeng Ki-yong finally stepped down from the show on his own accord. KBS 1 Night 2 Days's Kim Ju-hyuk's mother passed away. 1 Night 2 Days aired its episode as usual but it did go back and make slight edits. They have already filmed the next trip so there should be enough time for him to rejoin the cast.   KBS Pilots   Looking Back At Myself (나를 돌아봐) is the first KBS pilot program cleared to become a regular program. It will air on July 24.    One of the reasons that Lee Kyung-kyu left Healing Camp was to focus more on this new show. (He also wanted to devote more effort to Take Care of My Dad.)  Brave Family, Lady Action, and Exciting India have failed to become regular programs. Do As You Wish is the only candidate remaining out of the pilots that have been aired. Two episode pilot called 후계자 (literal translation: Heir) will air starting on July 10. Originally planned for July 3 but was moved back.   Trot audition program hosted by the Do Kyung-wan / Jang Yoon-jung couple.  KBS's new soccer variety show, Youth FC (청춘FC) will start airing on July 11.   The show, hosted by former soccer player Ahn Jung-hwan, revolves around those who have failed to achieve their dream of becoming a professional soccer player. The best players will be taken to Europe for extensive training.  The pilot formerly called We Are Siblings (now called 우애를 위해) is having difficulties in casting, resulting in delays.

Kang Hodong's star power has really dropped, I wonder whether it will be replaced. Do As You Wish seems like it might get picked up after the pilot did relatively well.  I wonder how SBS are going to save it's Sunday block - it has been horrible ever since Running Man ran out of steam. Part of Running Man's troubles can be attributed to the week lead in. Take Care of My Dad started off well but its slowly gearing towards Barefooted Friends /Roommate levels. It did okay with Kpop Star, which brought Running Man up to 10-13%. Headache for them."

koreanvariety,3c8p8c,furyswipesoflove,2,Mon Jul 6 01:39:53 2015 UTC,Talk about the sky falling. If you watch RM's viewership the past couple of years RM has been up and down in viewers and if SBS wanted to take off RM they would have done it last year. I think the honest truth is that even though they're getting their butts kicked by 1N2D SBS probably doesn't have anything else that could even match how RM is doing at the moment no matter how bad it looks.   I also believe SBS is making tremendous amount of money overseas by selling viewing rights to other TV companies all around Asia. This is why I feel RM like to promote overseas so much and why SBS doesn't seem to care if they do.
koreanvariety,3c8p8c,Hitokiri2,0,Mon Jul 6 04:00:11 2015 UTC,"They don't care about ratings at Korea. It's more like they care about their outboard fan meetings and event. And as long as they can milk ifans for money, it will be on even with 3% ratings like We Got Married."

koreanvariety,3c7o5a,Pearroc,6,Mon Jul 6 22:14:50 2015 UTC,"One half of it defines what I think makes a great RM episode (cast interaction, letting them be themselves, not letting the game dictate the humor) and the other half is what makes RM so frustrating. Choi Min Ho and Hong Man being invincible? The group of guards literally breaking into full sprint to catch Ji Hyo? It's the equivalent of putting Lionel Messi on the field with five year olds.   It just baffles me that the writers sat down and gave the go ahead for this idea - actually - any idea that involves invincibility in the final games. There needs to be something that balances this stuff out in games like this (e.g. find an item and freeze/eliminate a member).   This ending was as awkward and as weird as the RM Avengers special."
koreanvariety,3c7o5a,okaysian,3,Fri Jul 10 08:18:17 2015 UTC,"Awkward scripting is what happened. Looks like Seohyun got an injury and wasn't in the game at all for the 2nd part, a couple of other injured members and you have to script some parts out. That lead to a pretty wacky ending."

Kinda refreshing to see each of SNSD members with the new hair colors. Yuri looks slimmer from the last time I saw her on RM, which was years ago. Jihyo with full mud on her face - that's a first time I saw her like that.  Hong Man - when he's standing next to KJK I can't believe it make KJK looks small in comparison. His wardrobe reminds me of the movie Wreck-It-Ralph. Sooyoung - master of negotiation that even both of the catcher can't refuse. Hard to believe this is really her first time on a variety show?

The opening was iffy, but the games were really inspired and I was surprised and pleased to see that nearly all the guests got some decent screen time and fun moments.   Soo-young is really great on variety, with her 'persuasion skills'. Sunny was fun too, I loved how she turned and chased Min-ho after she was down to give him a piece of her mind. Ji-hyo was super badass and manly this episode, getting her face all covered with mud, being a boss in the overpass game, and even using her back as a stepping stone for Sunny.   spoiler  Choi Min-ho is also a total boss.

It would've been nice if, upon solving the Rubik's Cube (or perhaps if they had another different hint to find), the members were told that the AC could be eliminated. That way spoiler"

Also yea the AC is sorta OP but i dont think its a guaranteed win since if it had been one of the members at the bottom of the stairs with yoona they probably would of eliminated her.   The main problem was that they  found out who was the  AC to late into the game , plus the AC being one of the people who had a cube and figured it out.

They mentioned it somewhere around the time they said that the hunters wouldn't touch her. And that's why no one took her out. Most teams were down 2-3 members already by the time it was revealed. Otherwise Yuri could have done her in on the staircase after Haha was removed and tossed the barcodes.  Edit: It's with like 4 minutes until the end of the episode, with the female voice over. The SBS caption says that whoever takes out the angel code will be eliminated."
koreanvariety,3c7o5a,SpCommander,4,Mon Jul 6 23:29:29 2015 UTC,"idk Korean so i cant say you are wrong or right, but in the Dramafevers subs there is no mention of what you said. the only thing the female voice said is that she is the angel an she need to get to the platform and scan her wist quick so she can stop people from escaping the game world."

koreanvariety,3c7o5a,ttg13,-2,Mon Jul 6 23:23:52 2015 UTC,Yoona's the spy.   I think it would be great if she didn't know she was the spy and had to figure out that she's the angel code.

koreanvariety,3c7o5a,kyopda,3,Fri Jul 10 19:03:32 2015 UTC,"Okay, this was actually a good episode and one of the better in a while with an exception of few flaws.  Good things:  Amazing edits and sound effects: Despite what people say about RM's quality recently, these two are something RM is good at and I still believe they are the best out of Korean varieties.  Elimination game was really good: Had everything that made RM great. Choi Hongman and Minho showed no mercy and chivalry. And that's why it was good because Sooyoung really had to convince them to get away and created fun moments.  Mini game/Final game ratio was good: long elimination game was the formula for some of the best RM episodes.  2nd Tetris game was creative and fun: I hope they bring it back at later episodes as long as it's not repetitive.  Bad things:  Mud games: You know what this means. It means cheap body gags, people playing physically and messy, and staff claiming their guests are showing ""different and ugly sides"" despite high class/shy images. And all these three were indeed present here.  The Pac-Man game had an excellent game plan, but it was disturbing to watch how some of the members went on to stripping each other. It seemed like watching a gay porn at some parts, and I can't believe the staff still has the courage to air that and even show flashbacks to past episode where YJS's pants got pulled down. This means the staff still haven't got a clue why people hate their pulling down pants jokes nor read their boards which erupted in complaints again. I can't understand their obsessions despite how much they suffered at Ep. 38 when that first happened. They have to be thankful that Korean media doesn't pay attention to RM as they do to other shows like 1N2D or Superman triplets.  Final game design: Despite it was fun to watch, I still don't have a clue what the staff had in mind in designing this game. It seemed they paved a way for Yoona to snatch an easy win at the end while other SNSD members/RM members play extras. Could have been much better."

koreanvariety,3c7o5a,alastoris,0,Tue Jul 7 05:35:07 2015 UTC,"As you can tell by the upvotes and downvotes. The generally consensus is that both Bittorrent and Utorrent are pretty bad (with ads and generally rather slow as it takes up a lot of computer's resource to run). I think there was an article about them a month or so ago that they have an exploit where they'd gather the user's data (pretty bad considering what we torrent are usually copy right material).   There are many other alternatives, but Deluge is (imo), really light weight and it does what i need it to. Open .tor files and download/upload. You can also do fancy stuff where you set upload limit, down limit, etc. But it has no ads, which is the biggest PLUS for me."

koreanvariety,3c7o5a,NowBiggerAndBetter,-2,Sun Jul 5 22:21:49 2015 UTC,"Woof.  How many different levels of terrible is that ending?  Wait, isn't there some common slang term for big build-up, no release?  Stage 1 fails for the same reasons why more people watch the 100m sprint than the 100m hurdle.  Maybe Stage 2 has some redeeming quality but the dancing ruins it.  Look at the accumulated damage on the girls.  Still, nothing worse than an ending with no resolution, no climax, where a silly construct blows up everything that came before, rendering it all meaningless.      People like to talk about RM quality, but what about context?  How does this episode fare compared to, say, E084 and E085 Big Bang Truncated Special?  Okay, fine.  There are reasons why the duology is shrunk down to back-to-back name-tag-ripping.  Even so, BBTS features one of the worst versions of the game where one side, being robbed of the ability to eliminate, is incentivized to make action not happen (see E254 Stage 3).  The special bonuses end up having little impact on the games, thus fail to spice the action.  At least E085 includes interaction with the company employees, a charm point compared to watching Big Bang scratch lottery tickets.  And yet, despite all these failings, BBTS still has a proper ending.  Which can not be said of E254."

This week's episode is pretty darn good, considering who the guest are. The concept isn't bad either, with a shittyseewhatididthere opening and the first few games were kept nice and short, showing the highlights. The games were entertaining in the fact that they are resembling the nostalgic games of Pacman and Tetris. Each and every one of the girls shines with their own unique personality. The mudflat game was quite interesting, which took a strange turn when they spoilers Guest appearance by orange panty.  Towards the final game, I personally think that the way a few members were taken out was kinda weird, but can't really put my finger on it. spoiler was taken out pretty quick though, I don't think she even had a chance of doing anything. Having bosses  on each floor was a pretty interesting idea. Having said that, making the bosses indestructible seems a bit hard for the members to complete the mission though. Maybe adding a mission where when the members succeed the bosses would freeze for a small amount of time. Plus, having the AC pretty much secure the winning spot, seeing as though she'sinvulnerable and plus the reflection, even though it took a little time for them to figure it out who the AC is.   Side-Note: I notice spoiler dresses like Wrech-It-Ralph since he's from a video game. Don't know what spoiler was suppose to resemble though, with that red suit.

koreanvariety,3c8sqw,Hyperion98,9,Sun Jul 5 23:41:17 2015 UTC,"Cast changes are unnecessary and would ruin the show in my opinion, but retooling the show is definately necessary. After watching the SNSD episode I thought the show was a perfect example of the things that are wrong with the show, namely that the PDs have no understanding of the concept, 'less is more' when it comes to variety. Nothing about the episode  feels natural, and they consistently fail to use their assets right.   Firstly. within the editing, there is an overemphasis on graphics, sound effects, and close up shots vs. wider shots that cuts the flow of the show and comedy, while maintaining a juvenile feel to the show. Secondly, the imbalance within the format - there is way too much running around compared to segments which allow for interaction. This increases the dependence on body gags which are only entertaining in moderation. There wasn't a single segment  where facets other than running & fighting were highlighted. Nothing is spontaneous and I assume the filming schedule during the day is so tight, that the members work with extreme time limitations on segments. Thirdly, what can the cast really do in relation to how much narrative and number of guests the PDs  put into the broadcast - there were 10 guests on this episode, wtf. Frankly, it felt like the editors wanted the concept of arcade games to even overshadow SNSD.  At the end of the day, the main PD and writer need to go asap."
koreanvariety,3c8sqw,Resistantperm,4,Mon Jul 6 01:19:17 2015 UTC,"This is so true. The main reason I still watch Running Man is because of the casts, not the whole story their production team creates...I mean, arcade games, what the heck was that.  Only two words for RM now: childish and unnatural.  Oh and the editing makes it even more childish.  Having said that, I would still watch RM even if they just stay in a room for a whole day playing simple games. (on second thought, I feel like this is better than the current concept)"
koreanvariety,3c8sqw,ginastringr,3,Mon Jul 6 03:06:59 2015 UTC,"""Having said that, I would still watch RM even if they just stay in a room for a whole day playing simple games. (on second thought, I feel like this is better than the current concept)""  Just want to add that the fanmeets, in my opinion, are basically some version equivalent to that and they are definitely far more entertaining than what the PDs are currently doing with the show. That (as a general idea, not the specific theme of a concert) should serve as some wake up call to the staff/crew, at least based on the accounts recalled by the cast members since the staff likely won't actually watch, but it doesn't.  That also makes me wonder about the cast members that have spoken up but haven't been listened to properly. Like based on probability, at least one or two (that also tune in to the show) must feel some form of frustration over the show's current format and must have felt strongly enough to mention something to the staff/crew. But there hasn't been any significant improvement except maybe through small aspects of random episodes, like the new pairings.   Also, to add to other things the PD really shouldn't be ignorant about: the previews. Most of the time, unless it's highly promoted beforehand, the ratings of the next episode suffer from not being given a preview at the end of the previous episode. I get how it's impossible if the episode has yet to be filmed, but they should at least put up a title screen mentioning the guests, like they did for  Ryu Hyun Jin and Kang Jung Ho's episode. It's also not something they should play with right now with the current status of the ratings. In the end, of course the final episode is all that matters, but it feels like there's a lot of carelessness going around and the lack of previews seem to be among the downsides due to that. So the combo of the recent quality of the episodes and the frequent lack of previews at the end of them is definitely not doing the show any favors."
koreanvariety,3c8sqw,amelisa28,2,Mon Jul 6 16:24:18 2015 UTC,"The actual PD ""Im Hyung Taek"" its the worst PD i've seen in my life."
koreanvariety,3c8sqw,deckard1985,2,Mon Jul 6 19:19:14 2015 UTC,"I posted this in another thread but I think, given the other comments here, that I can repost as many of you have said similar things.A lot of what made running man special is gone. Even the hallmark is badly butchered.  Don't read on if you haven't seen the episode.  Take this episode. At first I was super excited: NAME TAG RIPPING FINALLY. But then, they go and do that stupid angel code rule that gives Yoona virtually 100% chance to win. She was given Immunity and a Reflect so even if they wanted to stop her, a team would have to sacrifice a person to take her out. That kind of stuff is awful and ruins the magic of the name tag races. Reflect back to the 0XX episodes of 2010-2011-2012, where you just had chasers, or a team melee. No special BS (barring a few instances, but even then it didn't give an auto win like this week, just a big adv), just pure get them or get out goodness. Think back to episode 64, 4 years ago when SNSD was here the last time. It was YJK and Seohyun vs the other 5 couples. Everyone was linked by a flimsy paper chain. There was no resurrection, no immunity, no decoy (they rip your name and force another to be out), just 1v5 with 60 minutes on the clock. Those adrenaline pumping sequences were what brought RM its golden age."
koreanvariety,3c8sqw,SpCommander,5,Mon Jul 6 20:19:47 2015 UTC,"Why the low ratings? RM has changed too much from 'urban variety' and became a platform for guests to promote their album or movie/drama. The core element of RM which is the interaction and competition between the casts are slowly being abandoned.  Not to mention some of original PDs are no longer in the show, making the show loses its shine. Injuries also one of the major factor for the lack of name tag ripping or any mission that requires heavy physical interaction. If anyone noticed, Gary sprained his ankle in ep. 252 during the second game. Same goes with other casts where we often see their hands or legs gets wrapped in bandages after certain missions. Not a pretty sight, I know. How to increase rating? Bringing back the old format won't help that much. The show's writers need to think out of the box once in a while. Taking ideas from international/online fans is good but that won't help the ratings, they need to lure local viewers more than anything."
koreanvariety,3c8sqw,RichRikko,8,Mon Jul 6 01:55:37 2015 UTC,"People need to understand why Running Man is not going to be cancelled anytime soon. The show's ratings might be low overall but I can say with 100% certainity that very very few shows (if any) across Korean television bring in more money for its respective station than Running Man does for SBS. Sure, 1N2D has 17% ratings but that doesn't compete against the income that RM makes over and profit = all the station cares about. The constant ""RM is going to be cancelled soon"" doom and gloom posts are just unnecessary IMO. Running Man has become ""Featured Man"" as in the show has become about the guests with the cast as part time players rather than the guests fitting in with the cast. I don't understand how the PDs don't understand that the show's popularity is due to the cast. People don't watch Running Man for the guests. They watch for the cast. The cast is what has such high Hallyu popularity in other countries. The cast is why they are running highly attending fanmeets in Hong Kong. How come everyone gets this but the people running the show right now? Running Man needs to remember what got them to the dance. There is no more drama. There is no more suspense. It's all about silly dance games, meaningless minigames with no concrete direction and absolutely asnine final games that either involve luck or a ridiculous math equation. What happened to the Running Man that had 3 missions that led up to an awesome two team nametag pull game? What happened to a long standing mission that went to multiple locations and always involved running and action? Hell, I would take the spy missions back as boring as those got. Anything is better than what they are doing now. Running Man needs a better lead-in show. It's hard to have a good rating when your lead in show is destroyed by its competition. Return of the Superman and the Masked Singer just are tearing them apart right now. Fans need to stop freaking out. I've watched the majority of the shows that SBS Good Sunday faces quite a few times. I'm sorry but nothing about 1N2D is really revolutionary and the cast isn't as expectional. However, the show's format is very consistent and that's why it gets the ratings it does. Real Man has been slipping in ratings, and Return of the Superman and Mask Singer are examples of concept shows that really do fade out over a period of time (if you remember, Dad Where You're Going had very very similar numbers before Return of the Superman came along). Nothing is stopping SBS from taking back #1 besides SBS."
koreanvariety,3c8sqw,sfoura,8,Mon Jul 6 04:41:51 2015 UTC,"I disagree, I think you are overestimating the influence of the international market. The only money that comes in from international audiences is when they have their overseas fan-meetings and when they sell the show format or broadcasting rights overseas (like China). However, with the fan-meets, a lot of money is spent organising the event, and quite a bit of the money goes into the pockets of the cast. In terms of overseas broadcasting rights, a lot of shows (Where are we going, Dad? etc.) have sold to China and other markets, so Running Man has nothing special going for it there. Regardless, you are right that stations only care about the money that comes in. The majority of money comes in from local sponsors. Local sponsors choose programs based on their ratings. They don't care about international status because they only aim to sell their products within Korean borders. As such, most sponsors would choose 1N2D over RM. Running Man is in quite a precarious position because of its low ratings, and if it dips too low, its international popularity is not going to save it. Problem is, normally the cast-only episodes have comparatively low ratings, or consistent. As such, using guests is more economically viable because it draws more audiences to the problem, and companies (sometimes) pay the station to cast their people. People don't watch for the cast; that an international perspective divergent from Korean opinion. Name-tag pulling is no longer viable because it has been done so often that its boring. There are only so many ways that they can change the game to make it interesting, and they have no more ideas. The cast is already too good at it so it's just bland and cliched each time. I agree, a good lead in show is required. Which is why I suggested either a) extending KpopStar to the entire year or b) moving Law of the Jungle (very successful on weekday) to Sunday to pair with RM Superman has been going strong for the last two years, doesn't seem to be losing steam. Korean audiences don't need revolutionary, they need entertainment."
koreanvariety,3c8sqw,Resistantperm,6,Mon Jul 6 05:04:55 2015 UTC,"Broadcasting fees and the price of rights to shows vary considerably depending on their relative popularity in those consumer markets - so yes, influence of the international market has a great impact on the actual amount of earnings overseas. Such a class of royalties for rights to produce a new show are paid on a continual basis in which the creators normally have a percentage of revenue/profits on the backend. Also, to believe that korean sponsors that use product placement only care about korean consumers and the local market compared to, for example, Chinese consumers, or only  tv ratings without a more nuanced analysis of demographics and alternative mediums is naive. Although, I'm not saying ratings dont matter at all. I beg to differ that cast only ratings have comparatively low ratings. The recent kwang soo episode beat 3 episodes before it, the one after and the recent episodes.  The 222 episode where they dressed like aliens beat the prior 2 episodes, 216 superhero was comparatively worse ratings-wise than the episodes around it (although the episode before had shin min ah, and it actually beat the 3 episodes with guests before that by a margin of atleast 1%). The other recent cast only was 178 which beat the 4 previous episodes that had guests. So not so divergent as you make it out to be. However, I dont think anyone is advocating a purely cast show with no guests, but there is a major difference between having 1 or 2 guests regularly than 5+ guests on the regular. The reason that the relationships on the show havent taken any new aspects is because the show's format has remained unchanged for basically 2 years, and the ridiculous amount of guests. No new aspects have time or opportunity to flourish in that kind of situation. Actually the most recent interesting aspect which was between gary and kwangsoo required the LKS episode  to lay the groundwork for the conflict."
koreanvariety,3c8sqw,sfoura,3,Mon Jul 6 08:54:38 2015 UTC,"Ratings aren't as big of a deal as they seem. They matter in terms of eyeballs but what really matters is the percieved spending limits of the demographics that watch a certain show. That perception umbrella does include brand value and Running Man is still a show with a very significant brand perception even if the ratings aren't high right now. Of course, if ratings dip too low, that starts to negate everything but I don't think Running Man is even close to being to that point yet. It's not going to be cancelled yet though.   That's not what I'm saying. They can have amazing guests but, in the context of the show, the guests need to be integrated into the show, not become the show. With Running Man, the guests have become the show and that's a major issue.   99% of what I see in Korean variety has been done in some sort of way. The difference is the format of the show.   I am going to use 1N2D's most recent women's special as an example for this. Literally, they only had a shoe-flipping mission (which I've seen before), egg-cracking (which is a Korean variety staple), and karoke (a variety show staple) and yet it was INCREDIBLY entertaining. The shows don't have to be revolutionary at all, they just need to be entertaining ;)  There is nothing wrong with doing name-tag ripping games. The cast still makes it entertaining and they are fairly even outside of JSJ. The difference between RM now and RM back in its heyday is that the entire show had direction and suspense. There were a much better beginning/middle/end. The action was more exciting even with concepts that have been done to death and that's why name-tag games were good.  I would agree with KPOP Star for the entire year. Law of the Jungle needs to stay where it is. It's doing too well.  I've just seen too many concept shows come and go (including shows that focus on kids like Superman) to just say ""oh this show will last forever"". Plus, look at a show like Masked Singer that is starting to creep up on Superman in the ratings. My point is that SBS Good Sunday isn't so far behind the competition that they can't come back. They can. They just gotta figure out what to do.  I'd also like to add that, in general, the international fans and Korean viewers really aren't that different in terms of what they see right and wrong with RM. The drop in ratings has completely coincided with the international perception that the show's quality has gone down."
koreanvariety,3c8sqw,RichRikko,4,Mon Jul 6 05:31:48 2015 UTC,"I agree that Running Man is not on the brink of cancellation. It is saved somewhat by the fact that SBS have a very weak variety slate, and it's Saturday anchor (Star King) is doing worse. It is however, in dangerous territory, and could meet the same fate as X-Man did some years ago. Once renowned for being the biggest variety show on television with massive brand recognition but cancelled after a continuos decline in ratings. I watched a IC episode before and a PD said on the show that you can't possible have Yoo Jaesuk headlining a show that comes in last place. If that ever happens, the first thing they consider is changing the cast, then cancellation. RM is living off its international presence and lasting brand name, but once its reputation declines further, the brand name erodes and there is no longer incentive to keep it.  I agree that the guest can be integrated better. It's just that I hear many people asking for more member-only episodes, but I don't think that is a solution at all. Guests can be used very effectively, ala the Gukjoo/Hong Jinyoung/Baek Jiyoung episode some time ago. Its about matching them effectively and using them appropriately.  I don't agree with the fact that name-tag ripping can continue, its simply overdone, and the members are too good at it that the guests have no chance to keep up, or everything feels scripted because its been done before. Look at the ONLY variety show that has remained on air for 10+ years - Infinity Challenge. Part of it is because they have a vague format that allows them to mix things up and change the 'race' episodes that they have. Running Man needs to find variety, not remain static.  I agree that SBS can come back. They just need to make major changes to Running Man and bring in a better lead-in. Maybe another music show."

koreanvariety,3c8sqw,kyopda,2,Tue Jul 7 19:22:21 2015 UTC,"The dad show's doing okay considering their competition. It's much better show than Roommate Season 1 or Barefoot Friends and can hold its own until Kpopstar comes. Jungle is doing well at its own spot without serious competition and SBS wouldn't change its spot to where the fight for the ratings is much harsh.  And about RM's part, there's no need to change the members since people like all the members, and they have the best chemistry already. It's just the staff doesn't know that they have the best ingredients themselves. Follow these three rules, and they are back to where they were:  More mind games, less physical games.  More on the members, less on the guests.  More time on the final game, less on the minigames."
koreanvariety,3c8sqw,polidarida,2,Mon Jul 6 04:04:46 2015 UTC,"Take Care of My Dad started off decent ~8-9%, but is dropping like a rock week after week. Last week it was 6.0, this week 4.8. Its getting closer to Roommate levels and showing no signs of improving.  I agree that SBS probably won't change Law of the Jungle's spot, but it would be a high risk, high reward option if they went with it.  I think the problem with the cast is that they have been the same for 4 years. There is no new characters being made, everything is constant and boring."
koreanvariety,3c8sqw,Koreano7,1 point,Mon Jul 6 05:08:13 2015 UTC,Too bad SBS can't come up with a new variety that's better than even failing RM looking at what they did on Barefoot and Roommate. At least Dad show is liked by many people despite its ratings though.  spoiler
koreanvariety,3c8sqw,apreche,2,Mon Jul 6 06:28:35 2015 UTC,"suggestion 2 & 3 is quite impossible to happen.   Cast changes : Most people would not like it but still one of the quick solution there is. It could save the show as much as it would ruin the show. Addition is good but also means RM would hv 8 members that is too much for VS(6/7 is the optimal number). if addition/replacement will ever happen, they need to cast another girl to rival SJH or someone to rival KJK strength while at the same time, can talk and jokes well.  PD change : like above, it also hv the potential to save or ruin the show. for the moment, all i can say is they need new, brilliant, fresh ideas for the show.  lately, poor editing kinda turn me off from the show. eg : the bigbang ep. for almost the whole ep, i heard they keep using big bang songs as the BGM which gives me the impression of a newbie/non-expert is at work. they honestly could hv done better.  RM also need to stop inviting a lot of guest at once. HONESTLY, I REALLYx987654321 MEAN IT. less person, more airtime for both guest and cast.  for longevity of the show, less emphasize on results, more emphasize on interaction and the process. don't rush things and don't stretch too much either. from the recent episodes, i don't get the feel of bonding between the members and the guests much. bonding makes things and jokes happens to be more natural and pure fun.   my other suggestion is they need to make a new, interesting trademark game for RM like nametag ripping for the older episodes and the dangyunhaji game for X-Man"
koreanvariety,3c8sqw,Warlord_X,1 point,Mon Jul 6 05:14:17 2015 UTC,"I agree that cast changes could work. High risk, but high reward. Look at how the cast changes for IN2D S3 helped boost the ratings. It was a immediate jump. Running Man needs that, providing they bring in good cast members."
koreanvariety,3c8sqw,Enter_Text_Here,3,Mon Jul 6 06:08:48 2015 UTC,"A new PD or a revamped staff could be the best solution for SBS. After losing their main PD to the Chinese Running Man (if I remember correctly), they've been doing temporary fixes and losing their identity. That and the whole atmosphere seems forced and childish nowadays. Changing the cast could prove detrimental, however I think an additional member might be a good idea. Running Man has a huge international following (I think the biggest compared to IC and 1N2D) and taking out a member could be very, very bad.  Seems like a good idea, since KpopStar helps them out a lot, but the problem then stems on the short-length dramas. ""How to make them successful and interesting to keep viewers watching?"" Although it's technically a good idea for Running Man, this is a horrible idea for Law of the Jungle and SBS, since the program itself is good on its timeslot and moving it so it can compete against SuperMan and Mask Singer would be possibly a deathwish to Law of the Jungle. Although Running Man is getting diminished viewing counts, it's still strong internationally. And with the whole international tours and China thing, it still brings money (I think?). So, RM doesn't need to fear replacing and SBS shouldn't think of it either, for now at least.   All in all, finding a suitable duo partner for RM is important. But, for RM to also do better, the concept and identity needs to improve. I've been a huge fan ever since it began, but lately, I've lost that excitement. Hopefully, something changes. :|"
koreanvariety,3c8sqw,Seosoo7621,2,Mon Jul 6 02:57:10 2015 UTC,"They just have to work on developing a new program that is great. I liked Roommate, except for the fake love lines in season 1, but apparently not enough people agreed with me to keep it alive. I'm sure if they work hard they can come up with another show.  They don't really need to do much with Running Man except increase the consistency. Some episodes are great and others they phone in. I almost wouldn't mind if they just did Running Man every other week as long as they guarantee each episode is going to be a great one."

koreanvariety,3c7bfq,Scepter_ZA,4,Sun Jul 5 20:08:05 2015 UTC,"I know that's meant to be a lighthearted comment, but to be fair, during the press conference, the cast had discussed how she and Kwang Soo (though he's not too bad of a dancer, imo) had trouble learning the choreography since they're not natural dancers. That's also been obvious enough in RM episodes. I assume another factor would be JH never really caring to check the choreography until she had to for the fanmeets or due to her own curiosity, which makes sense since she normally just spontaneously dances for fun. Though I do think that this time around, she also didn't have as much time to rehearse because of her drama's schedule, which would keep her busy during filming and then tired in her spare time.   Buuuut the dance was a significant improvement if you compare that ""Family Outing"" clip to her attempts of doing the ""Hot Issue"" dance over the years, especially since like Jae Suk said in ep 219, back in the earlier days, they had barely been able to get her to do it. So it went from that famous attempt on ""Family Outing"" in August 2009 to the beginning of episode 55 in August 2011 to the dancing in episode 114 in October 2012 to the more voluntary moves in episode 156 in Spring 2013 then to early October 2014, this time on stage and way more assured during a dance break at the RM fanmeet (which, in later months, had been followed by more reflexive attempts during similar dance breaks) to later that month, when she had surprised everyone and spontaneously gone out (and stayed) during the dancing round in episode 219 then to the fanmeet in January 2015, when she danced a version of it merged with a bit of the choreography from ""Gangnam Style"" and now most recently, the elaborate performance on stage the other day.   It may take a while for the moves to be perfect, or maybe it won't ever happen, but it's great to see her feel more confident and comfortable enough with the act of dancing it."
koreanvariety,3c7bfq,amelisa28,10,Sun Jul 5 21:44:48 2015 UTC,I happen to think her dancing along with her tone deaf singing are quite endearing.
koreanvariety,3c7bfq,tt-asha,1 point,Sun Jul 5 22:25:28 2015 UTC,"Oh, not sure if you're just adding that or if my tone was misunderstood, but in case it's the latter, don't get me wrong, they definitely are. JH's my favorite out of the RM cast members, so I see her doing no wrong there.   One of the reasons she's my favorite also has to do with certain personality traits of hers that I can relate to, especially her taking a step back a lot so others can do their thing and she just helps in the background. But I also adore her ""4D"" personality when she displays it, so her having that extra confidence boost brings that out more (and superficially, it also makes the PD give her more screentime) and I really admire that especially since the notion associated with that inspires me to follow something like that in personal situations.  For example, ""Hot Issue"" aside, she's also grown a lot since the first RM fanmeet in Singapore, so in the latest fanmeets (and in general too), whenever she's excited while doing something she's proud of or is carefree about, I'm excited for her and that example would come to mind to help me feel assured when I might need that kind of mindset later on.  I hope that clarifies things in case my other reply was misconceived. >.<"

She also had her own alliance in E1 initially but dumped them half way for self-preservation. But again it's just my personal opinion so it may differ from yours and others, no issues :)"

I personally thought before the season started that he wont be able to slither his way past jang dongmin, but then he won Eps 1 in a Season 2-ish style. This Eps had a more S3 feel to it with the stronger alliance emerging victorious, but still Sangmin emerged victories with a large lead in garnets. i'm not sure i can attribute it all down to luck when counting this match he has 9 consecutive MM wins."

koreanvariety,3c5jpz,Bajin_Inui,6,Thu Jul 9 08:23:42 2015 UTC,"his genius moments in S1 were always in individual games, alliance-oriented games were never his forte. these alliance games will always favor Sangmin and Dongmin, and consequently Kyungran and Hyunmin. Yeonseung and Jungmoon chose the right side.  the other side of jinho/junseok/yoohyun seem really brittle tho. yoohyun has a tendency to go against dongmin and hyunmin, jinho against sangmin, while junseok has already proved himself to be a maverick. these 3 plus yoonsun and kyunghoon will have to quickly unite before their numbers dwindle further, or they will be quickly blown out of the water in future alliance games."

Maybe it's partly due to the editing and such but Yohwan is often ""begging"" to get his way—he could be a strong solo player but he appears too selfish for alliances. He could have just gone on his own as Yoonsun did for this MM but he probably though he wouldn't stand a chance on his own since everyone else was in an alliance.

Sangmin showed his stuff last eps but this time was Dongmin's turn. the previous episode had a slight Season 2-ish feel to it with the backstabbing plot twist near the end, but this eps definitely had the alliance domination feel of Season 3, with Sangmin/Kyungran joining Dongmin's camp and the other players playing minority as yoohyun often found himself during S3. Dongmin has proved his ""extrasensory"" label seen in episode 1, being able to detect the slight weight difference between chips and reading the minds of well known SC pro-gamers. i wonder if the producers came up with the label ""extrasensory"" after recording Eps 2 lol.  if the season continues going the way it is going right now i see jinho/junseok/yoohyun/yoonsun struggling to even match the 6 man +1 rogue alliance. sangmin has assembled a team that is based on trustworthiness to prevent backstabbing, and i dont see a way jinho and the others could break this alliance other than getting someone from within to defect..... maybe he could try and influence dongmin to go against sangmin seeming as he will run away with the lead if keeps his garnet income rate per episode.  another thing to consider is sangmin's potential garnet lead as seen in Season 2... i know it's very early in the season but if he keeps getting garnets like he is right now he will be almost invincible in every garnet matches in the future. i would like to see Sangmin once in a death match, fella is a MM beast but has never won a DM, i'd like to see him prove himself there as the other champions did."
koreanvariety,3c5jpz,NaeSeNamJDM,3,Thu Jul 9 11:53:29 2015 UTC,"I don't think the alliance is confirmed like that yet. It might not be the same alliance next episode. Sangmin wanted Dongmin because he is no.11 and Kyungran is no.12. And Dongmin also thought that it is a win-win situation. So they joined hand because there are something to gain. Actually they plan to have joint winner with Sangmin getting one less garnet, but the plan fail so..the best outcome is to put sangmin as a winner since he bet differently."

Also, outsiders HJH/LJS/KYH (include KKH who's a floating troll with no real allegiance and LYS who no one wants to ally with) just can't seem to work together...I'm thinking these guys will eventually figure out a MM or get singled out one-by-one for DM and try to take out members of said core alliance."

koreanvariety,3c4wh2,HuruHara,2,Sun Jul 5 08:46:58 2015 UTC,"He might be getting cut for his upcoming movie, 'Mutant'."
koreanvariety,3c4wh2,Resistantperm,5,Sun Jul 5 11:01:56 2015 UTC,"He actually already finished filming that a while ago: http://forums.soompi.com/en/topic/344529-upcoming-movie-2015-the-mutant-mutation-%EB%8F%8C%EC%97%B0%EB%B3%80%EC%9D%B4-park-bo-young-lee-kwang-soo-lee-chun-hee/  And based on the top pic here http://file.osen.co.kr/article/2015/05/15/201505151809771267_5555bcaa9a7a9.jpg, it seems having a six pack wouldn't really be necessary for his character.

koreanvariety,3c4r2t,leesam,20,Sat Jul 4 19:45:45 2015 UTC,i like him  he may not be my favorite member but i think he's the one that put the most effort into creating a bond within the cast. he's almost always the one to initiate conversations and he knows how to work up a crowd. dude may seem overzealous at times (which appears to annoy alot of people) but personally i don't really see a problem with that
koreanvariety,3c4r2t,lupin88,13,Sat Jul 4 20:00:06 2015 UTC,"Taehyun is someone who ad-libs really well and plays a gracious host. He makes the members very comfortable and was vital to helping the new cast members in the early season. That's why they would always comment that they ""needed"" CTH when he was missing. He's not like Junho who can pull out jokes from thin air and make things hilarious but he's an essential part of what makes 1n2d work."
koreanvariety,3c4r2t,gr1zzlybear,8,Sat Jul 4 21:50:42 2015 UTC,"Let me just add to this, what also make CTH good is that his reactions (him laughing) is contagious and seems real. Not saying he fakes it but sometimes you can tell when people are giving a fake reaction just for airtime, and you don't get that with him."
koreanvariety,3c4r2t,CptKookie,6,Sun Jul 5 05:33:35 2015 UTC,"After watching the earlier episodes, I can see why he got all the hate. He tried way too hard to try and take over the MC role of the show when it doesn't really fit him. He also seemed to pick on joo hyuk a lot more than the other members because he was so nice. However he has def improved in the recent episodes, and is now one of my favorite members."
koreanvariety,3c4r2t,LeT0ucan,9,Sat Jul 4 20:30:02 2015 UTC,"Defconn has improved much since his earlier days in 1N2D, i think he's just too eager because working in 1N2D is literally his dream comes true. people can be overexcited about living the dream.   as for Taehyun, yes i understand he doesn't look like to do much. he 'just' laughs, but i think his laughs is what make him so funny; it is infectious. i find it hard not to laugh whenever he's laughing. he also has great reactions towards events happening around him, and as we know, variety is about reactions."
koreanvariety,3c4r2t,natcookie,3,Sat Jul 4 21:00:49 2015 UTC,"Defconn is definitely the member who cares the most. As he said in the first episode, 1N2D is the job he always wanted. He mentioned about how years before he would be entering KBS Yeouido and see Kang Ho-Dong recording at the steps and dream of him getting the chance to be on the show.  For that reason, he has never bothered me. It might come across as 'trying too hard to be MC' or whatever, but he is just extremely passionate and wanted to do a good job.  I also love '근심 돼지' (Geunsim Dwaeji / Concerned Pig). He always wants everything to go well and can't help but be concerned that something might not work out well for the show."
koreanvariety,3c4r2t,Oat-,2,Sun Jul 5 02:09:50 2015 UTC,"years before he would be entering KBS Yeouido  see Kang Ho-Dong recording at the steps  dream of him getting the chance to be on the show   Yeah, that moment pretty much sealed my impression him too. You just genuinely get the sense that he absolutely appreciates being on the show.  Even if it gets in his way sometimes, he has had the most perfect attitude for a show like 1N2D so far.  Edit: Link to the Yeouido moment."
koreanvariety,3c4r2t,franklin_donuts,7,Sun Jul 5 14:55:26 2015 UTC,"I think Defconn is very likeable, and I agree about TaeHyun, I think he is just popular because of his acting work, and not his variety work."
koreanvariety,3c4r2t,baegjag,4,Sat Jul 4 19:54:02 2015 UTC,"Taehyun just has a great image already due to his acting work....and he just has a very lovable face and overall vibe. I guess in variety, he's just great because he is natural."
koreanvariety,3c4r2t,dreamraine,2,Sun Jul 5 03:20:36 2015 UTC,I'm up in the air on defcon still from watching like every episode twice. He just tried too hard so it doesn't seem natural. Plus every time food comes up or they eat he does this sound that is annoying.  Cha tae hyun just seems natural like he isn't trying hard to be likeable. His laugh is infectious too so he basically can make anyone feel comfortable. I dunno how successful the show would be if he was there from the beginning to loosen everyone up.
koreanvariety,3c246z,ttg13,11,Sat Jul 4 01:31:02 2015 UTC,man UEE's comments kills you. If she was being sincere on what she said shes that type of girl that you would want to date.
koreanvariety,3c246z,ilangshot,3,Sat Jul 4 03:38:04 2015 UTC,The previous episode when the members called UEE was full of them. Not sure whether she was doing in subconsciously or not but seriously!
koreanvariety,3c246z,Hyperion98,16,Sat Jul 4 06:36:49 2015 UTC,"The first part was good, nice to see this side of Kwanghee. The members seem to like this match-making sort of stuff, they did it for Hongchul and also in the Relationship Fabrication episodes. Even Myungsoo is a romantic at heart.   The last 30 minutes though has got to be the best half hour of Korean television I've seen in recent months. Just seriously hilarious. Wonderfully done and made perfect use of the guests. Ji Sungryeol in particular was hilarious.  Also think Myungsoo has been on a roll recently. Has been in great form over the past few episodes."
koreanvariety,3c246z,Hyperion98,7,Sat Jul 4 01:36:03 2015 UTC,"I think adding the first part is good because they seemed to cut a bunch of stuff out of the 2nd part, plus it was nice seeing Kwanghee X Uee :D   On a side note towards PMS-YJS has mentioned before that he's a bit of a romantic guy towards his wife"
koreanvariety,3c246z,jsrave,5,Sat Jul 4 02:47:00 2015 UTC,Haha yeah ~ Seorae Village's Brangelina couple!! Myungsoo has started to show more of this side of himself and I think its great.
koreanvariety,3c246z,Hyperion98,7,Sat Jul 4 06:38:23 2015 UTC,"omo, i squealed with the members while watching kwanghee and uee chit-chatting. their segment is so sweet, i've watched the part for 3 times today! wish all the best for them. i know it's variety show and there bounds to be some scripting along the way, but i don't care, they look so cute together lol"
koreanvariety,3c246z,natcookie,2,Sat Jul 4 11:20:13 2015 UTC,"I think this was the first time I've heard Kwanghee's voice that low. He's always been too camp for me but the moment he saw UEE, he became really manly lol"
koreanvariety,3c246z,runaway4231,3,Mon Jul 6 08:23:50 2015 UTC,"You had me nervous there, I was like ""Oh is the rest not as good..?"" Looking forward to this episode. And YES I agree so much Myungsoo has been on fire recently!"

koreanvariety,3c246z,IClurker,5,Sat Jul 4 04:57:07 2015 UTC,"Hilarious episode, but at the same time I'm a bit disappointed 'I Need Romance' wasn't turned into a proper special. It's always a treat when Bongsun & Jaedong appear on MuDo."
koreanvariety,3c246z,IClurker,4,Sat Jul 4 06:44:38 2015 UTC,There was pretty much no way they were gonna be attracted to each other. They have all known each other for a long time and hang out without developing feelings. They are just funny.
koreanvariety,3c246z,sportsteambfan,5,Sat Jul 4 17:09:11 2015 UTC,"Oh no question about it. That was not the original idea for the special though. They were originally gonna search for matches, but they mentioned at the beginning that they decided to just get the six of them together since they had too many projects lined up. They basically gave up on the project and just tried to do something people would find entertaining with what they had."
koreanvariety,3c246z,IClurker,2,Sat Jul 4 20:07:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah, looked like they just didn't have the time to properly do it, they mentioned at the beginning about being 5 people per gender but it ended up just 3 per gender."
koreanvariety,3c246z,ZoddGutts,2,Sun Jul 5 08:41:47 2015 UTC,"Feels like they needed a filler ep before the big Mudo event eps, even as a filler ep it was very funny."
koreanvariety,3c246z,ZoddGutts,12,Sun Jul 5 08:38:58 2015 UTC,"Love for Kim Jedong, anyone? Ji Sungryeol is even better now compared to his X-man days. He was what Defconn is now back in those days. Hope he gets some bigger gigs rather than just as guest jury in King of Mask Singer."
koreanvariety,3c246z,femacca,7,Sat Jul 4 05:30:00 2015 UTC,"Yes! Jaesuk is always great with his 'options' ala Kim Youngchul, Kim Jedong, Ji Seungryul and Defconn. He makes the best of them and they have been loyal in return."

koreanvariety,3c246z,sportsteambfan,-3,Sat Jul 4 16:56:46 2015 UTC,That may be the case but that doesn't change the fact that he was humiliated. He seaches for a girlfriend but with his public image it's impossible. Not every TV viewer is able to differentiate.
koreanvariety,3c246z,leesam,9,Sat Jul 4 19:27:25 2015 UTC,"Doesn't he have a pretty good public image? Jaesuk has said before that Jedong is actually a bit of a homme fatale, and although his tv image is like that he is popular with the public because of his talk concerts. There will always be viewers who can't differentiate."
koreanvariety,3c246z,syaaah8,7,Sat Jul 4 22:00:54 2015 UTC,IC doesn't really showcase this but Jaedong is on the second level tier of MC underneath the YJS god tier and has been for years. He's incredibly popular and well-known
koreanvariety,3c246z,sfoura,3,Sun Jul 5 01:11:04 2015 UTC,It's a running gag. Jae Dong is like an unofficial IC member. He's always there when they need a guest and they always joke about his air time. I think it was in RM where Jae Suk said that Jae Dong is best friends with a lot of the top actresses. I forgot the top actress who he climbs mountains with.   I've seen him be depressing awkward in other shows. It's like his trademark.
koreanvariety,3c246z,runaway4231,3,Sun Jul 5 12:26:24 2015 UTC,"He's like Butters at South Park. A person whom they take advantage of or bring as space fillers everytime they feel like needing someone. In other words, he's like IC's official Hogu.  spoiler"

Oh well, will probably be a good episode nonetheless, IC usually delivers every week."
koreanvariety,3c246z,runaway4231,1 point,Sat Jul 4 04:16:18 2015 UTC,lol She's in a drama today so it's natural she'll be appearing in one of the variety shows. And they've been thirsty for UEE since Kwanghee joined. It's inevitable she'll make an appearance and give Kwanghee something to do.

koreanvariety,3c0a1f,kenlendar,6,Fri Jul 3 16:28:57 2015 UTC,"Not terribly convincing. They decide to replace half the cast, saying there won't be any repeat countries, then suddenly realise Japan is a special case they really need? Despite the show constantly tip toeing around all the tensions between the two countries, never actually addressing it because it's too controversial. Oh and they replace the idol in his early twenties with... an even younger idol, equally or less equipped to handle these contentious issues.   I could maybe buy their excuse if like one of the NB comments suggested they got someone like Ryohei (who has good experience dealing with Korea/Japan tensions and is older with less need to manage his image). I kinda feel bad for the guy since he didn't ask for SM and JTBC to throw him into this snake pit, but yeah... Hard to support the show at this point with so many crap production decisions."

koreanvariety,3bu842,Hitokiri2,36,Thu Jul 2 04:51:22 2015 UTC,"The demographics of international viewers are heavily skewed towards the younger ages.  Young Koreans are the main viewing demographic for Running Man and a good portion of them still watch the show.   The criticisms of Running Man in recent months by international viewers pretty much mirror what Korean netizens have been saying in their forums. Everyone seems to favor the older episodes over the new. So it's not like foreigners and Koreans have wildly different standards.   The only significant difference is that, internationally, there's still a lot of people discovering the show for the first time. So, there's still room for growth internationally.  Also, MBC's Sunday night shows were utter crap for 5+ years before they hit the jackpot with ""Dad Where Are We Going"" and ""Real Men"". Then KBS rolled out ""Return of Superman"" and ""1N2D Season 3"". And MBC is swinging for the fences with ""King of Mask Singer"". SBS never had a good permanent program to complement Running Man since Law of the Jungle and Kpop Star operated in seasons...and Law of the Jungle is doing too good in its own time slot to move back to Sunday."

koreanvariety,3bu842,Acnologia7,3,Fri Jul 3 14:39:58 2015 UTC,"Forced lovelines, which was awkward for the people involved as well as the viewers.   Horrible editing, teasers at the end of episodes that never saw the light of day. Which is a shame, because most of this clips at the end of each episodes seemed way more fun to watch than anything else the showed.  More horrible editing in the show as well, they showed a clip of Sunny and Nana (I think it was) writing some words on the blackboard in the kitchen, and BOOM, next scene, it was gone. Most of the scene switching and editing made no sense throughout the season.  That is a couple of things I did not care for during the Roommate show, but I kept watching each episode nonetheless, because some of the cast members sort of saved what was left of it.  Edit: Forgot about the fact that the show turned into a guesthouse, and they scrapped the whole idea of celebrities living together."

koreanvariety,3bu842,Acnologia7,4,Fri Jul 3 20:44:28 2015 UTC,"Agree. Is really hard to create something new to the slot prior to running man with KBS(children) and MBC (singing) programme. They tried to capture with the chuseok pilot but I guess it failed.   They will never take off Running Man cause taking it off means losing out Yoo Jae Suk for that time slot. Can you imagine creating a new program with no guarantee and might lose out Nation MC? Is too risky for SBS to take that step. The only way they will think of replacing is if the ratings fall below 7 to 5% for continuous week. Otherwise I guess it would remained.  Somehow, I just wish that the PD would just bring back the old game. If you realise, they actually shorten the time of the programme from 1 hour 30 minutes to just 1 hour 10 minutes. Just bring back the old game and handicapped jong kook if you want surprise. Otherwise, I guess they won't be able to hold long for that time slot."
koreanvariety,3bu842,liventan,4,Thu Jul 2 11:16:17 2015 UTC,"Yep, perfectly explained.   I must say over the past few months I've got to the point where I no longer care for the show. What killed it for me was not reoccuring themes or silliness, it was  guests. I ended up tuning in purely for the banter between the main cast but that's really been cut down recently.  It's for this reason I moved to watching pretty much only Infinite Challenge (other than stuff like SMTM)"
koreanvariety,3bu842,Lextube,8,Thu Jul 2 13:08:43 2015 UTC,1N2D season 3 members have really nice banter amongst themselves if that's what you're looking for!
koreanvariety,3bu842,stijnx,4,Thu Jul 2 15:26:25 2015 UTC,This! I just got less interested in the guests in Running Man as the interaction between cast kept fading. 무도 is always full of great cast interactions which keeps the show very entertaining.
koreanvariety,3bu842,naiku,9,Thu Jul 2 23:53:13 2015 UTC,"As others have said, running man appeals to the younger foreign audience I guess.You could also ask the reverse question in why 1N2D isn't that popular with foreigners and get a similar answer.1N2D doesn't seem to even pull half the numbers that Running Man does on foreign viewing sites."
koreanvariety,3bu842,nasedo22,6,Thu Jul 2 06:42:44 2015 UTC,"As people have said, the humour in Running Man translates very well across most cultures. Most other variety shows are very rooted in their original culture (many of the other shows that are now growing in popularity online also appeal to a wide range of audiences: Crime Scene, for example, is very North American in its premise, and The Genius is based off Japanese manga, is surprisingly individualistic for a Korean show, and has a pretty much universal execution). Also even in its early days, RM made a point of appealing to its international audience-- for example, all those trips it made to countries across southeast Asia even in the first year or two of the show's run.   Also I feel like RM is a show that has room to grow in foreign popularity because of its set up. As others have noted, it's really really rare to find a show that has kept essentially the same member line up for so many years. This is more reminiscent of North American/Western tv-viewing culture, or even in other Asian countries (Japanese anime that goes on for years and years and years comes to mind for example) and therefore will likely appeal to those of us used to watching characters and actors grow up onscreen over the course of many seasons-- as opposed to a Korean tv-viewing culture where dramas are short and contained, and shows (variety and drama alike) frequently adjust line-ups even in the middle of a season."
koreanvariety,3bu842,concreteroads,5,Thu Jul 2 13:05:07 2015 UTC,"Because the PD, and beacuse all the shows, Real Man, 1n2d put new members, its really hard to be 5 years with the same members, a lot of shows change the members because the ratings. RM since this year always was in double digits. The last poll about the favorite korean varieties  http://www.soompi.com/2015/03/25/infinity-challenge-named-koreas-favorite-tv-show/"
koreanvariety,3bu842,deckard1985,8,Thu Jul 2 05:10:52 2015 UTC,"I am a foreigner myself and I'm bored of running man. However I understand why the rating difference and the international hype. This is because most of the other show is about Korean Culture and you need to really know the cast to really understand the comedy. If you realise, 1n2d and real men is all about the cast and what they do, it take some time to actually understand the joke.  However, running man manage to capture the audience during the catch and tear game which make it famous until now. The first hook is important towards international audience and running man manage to catch that 4 years back them. But I heard that international fan reduce a lot especially those who follow korean variety.  Btw, i usually take 15-20min to watch one ep coz it get so boring, imagine playing so many pre-game but the final game is either to fill the water bottle or who open up the box faster. It's more like a telematch game. Somehow I felt dreamteam game is even more exciting. In my opinion, the only thing to watch is just the chemistry of the member, thats all.  PS: 1N2D ladies friend version really did a good job (pretty Bo Young) and Real Men Season 1 is really awesome with Hyung Sik, Soo Young and Jang Hyuk. If given an option for me to watch it on TV, I would defintely not choose running man.  Do try Infinity Challenge if most of the fan are Jae Suk and Haha Fan. No harm trying. You my like it more than running man."
koreanvariety,3bu842,liventan,2,Thu Jul 2 10:46:21 2015 UTC,"I really don't think the viewer base in South Korea has dropped by half. According to a list someone posted a week or so ago, Running Man had its worst episode viewership in 2010. It has gotten better since then."
koreanvariety,3bu842,CraziedHair,4,Thu Jul 2 18:59:28 2015 UTC,It's more family friendly than other shows plus it relies more on physical comedy than the other shows.
koreanvariety,3bu842,sportsteambfan,8,Thu Jul 2 05:10:32 2015 UTC,"I believe it's a lot to do with the physical comedy myself. I live in Ireland and most of my friends aren't interested in Korean music or TV like I am, yet when I show them Running Man they all think it's hilarious. The kind of humor in Running Man translates really well and even without subtitles can be incredibly funny. Even my Dad watches Running Man. I think that's also why Kwangsoo is so popular overseas."

Maybe not so loved like Inifite Challenge, but RM is very loved in Korea and the members are really loved too, but i think the problems are in the Pd's department right now."

koreanvariety,3bu842,Oat-,2,Thu Jul 2 16:55:48 2015 UTC,"Infinite Challenge, 1 Night 2 Days, and Running Man are the big three shows that are the flagship of the three major broadcasting stations in Korea. Most of the time, being on the show means you have made it as a celeb (in Korea). Also the guests get more popular after they appear on the big three because many new people who didnt know them before will now recognize them."
koreanvariety,3bu842,arcadefire08,2,Thu Jul 2 18:22:51 2015 UTC,"I don't how it works in other Asia. Countries but the Korean way if doing variety shows seems to be that there are no breaks! A new episode every week and that show is like 5 years old with 200 something episodes. There's bound to be franchise fatigue to the Korean people but the international viewers might just be getting in to it and will catch a few random episodes and will have a lot to binge watch for a while but with that many episodes, it will be a huge task to just watch everything and might turn some people off.   I haven't really watched that show in about 2 years because it did kind of get repetitive. I'd just watch when there would be guest that I wanted to see but then I gave up. Now in want to check a recent episode out though."

koreanvariety,3bu842,truthy567,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:35:40 2015 UTC,The best point is definitely due to the format of the show being more appealing to international audiences vs 1N2D which requires a certain level of Korean cultural knowledge that most international fans (even if they've been around a while) don't have.  I also have to mention the cast strength too. RM has a stronger overall set cast than both 1N2D and Real Men. Not only has the cast been around the longest as a unit but a top 4 of YJS/JSJ/LKS/Haha just are on another level than either of those two. I know Gary/SJH get crap nowadays but they aren't bad enough to offset how good those 4 are. I'd say only IC has a stronger cast.  RM just has to tweak its format a bit and I believe it's ratings will rise with South Koreans too.
koreanvariety,3bu842,sfoura,-1,Thu Jul 2 20:23:48 2015 UTC,Most foreigners are kpop or kdrama fans so RM is the perfect show for them.
koreanvariety,3bv2ax,feverapple,18,Thu Jul 2 11:38:07 2015 UTC,"Yup, different sound editor. The usual sound editor is changing, possibly to a much younger editor. The usual one is in his 30's, his musical selection is usually 90's song or the classic pop song. Sample : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT1HCQcSHW0 The scene in question (ep 55): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inyGKwh83rM   The new editor is using audio level way lower than we used to hear, and cutting it too soon, this is why the tunes is forgettable. The old editor is using the tunes and the speech/ambient on the same (volume) level, and he's not afraid to go a full 30 sec long, even more with the same tunes while muting/lowering the ambient.   IMO, one of the great sound editing (that i can recall fondly) is on Macau 1st episodes (ep 133). Specifically when Dongwook jumping, you can see/hear the editor working to keep the pace. And he's using a two song from a same group (Queen). He's not just relentlessly put a music, but was not afraid to completely muted the sound, to convey the emptiness.  Then BAM ! Another perfectly put song.   Another good example is when Gary & YJS jumping over the hurdle (ep 117), he's not afraid to use a long music (""Jump by AC/DC Van Halen, cover by Glee Cast), unlike the new editor.   See ? The old editor almost always use a 90's song with long duration in major event."
koreanvariety,3bv2ax,YJSubs,2,Thu Jul 2 12:43:49 2015 UTC,"Ah! I knew I wasn't going crazy thinking the sound editing has been really weird lately. Thank you for this. So are you saying the previous editor will no longer be doing RM anymore? If so, then that makes me really sad. The awesome sound editing from before really made RM that much better for me. I will be very sad if this current sound editing continues :("
koreanvariety,3bv2ax,blarrrgo,2,Thu Jul 2 16:16:56 2015 UTC,"No need to be sad, this is a common practice in broadcast.    SBS is a company, they roll the editor/crew. So from time to time the old editor is back editing RM again. although not often as it used to be."
koreanvariety,3bv2ax,YJSubs,4,Thu Jul 2 16:37:22 2015 UTC,"This was a really informed and well written post but the song ""Jump"" is by Van Halen, not AC/DC, so the rest of your post is invalid."

koreanvariety,3bv2ax,ginastringr,5,Thu Jul 2 12:14:04 2015 UTC,"Also, I've notice the on-screen texts/caption are very obvious and at times unnecessary. E.g. when they're playing games and some one gets pushed over or falls, a caption will pop up stating that XXX pushed XXX."

koreanvariety,3bv2ax,kelmah,1 point,Thu Jul 2 22:56:02 2015 UTC,"I think they've been experimenting with a lot of different things, both in how the games are run and also in the way the show is edited. For example, the social media theme that they played with in the most recent episode. Sometimes these new tricks work really well, but sometimes (like again, the most recent episode) I find it choppy.  Part of this probably has to do with the old PD team slowly moving to other shows and being replaced by younger or new PDs, FDs, and other crew members.   I agree with you, the opening of the most recent episode was quite messy. The opening is usually my favourite part of any episode, so I was surprised that the production team kept in that long clip where the boys just talk over each other. I think that episode, while it had decent guests and good games, was pretty sloppily edited in general."

Episodes with close friends (or even just friends that you are comfortable being around) as guests are always my favorite specials on this show, aside from audience specials.   Boyoung and Taehyun are the cutest cutest cutest combo ever. And I think Moon Geun Young should be on a variety show. Any variety show really, I love her competitiveness and the way she let loose and had fun in every activity they did."

koreanvariety,3boy0s,mkatter,3,Wed Jul 1 01:10:23 2015 UTC,My favorite will be always Episode nº74
koreanvariety,3boy0s,RichRikko,2,Wed Jul 1 00:02:29 2015 UTC,"So I went to take a look at the list of RM episodes to sieve out my personal favorites. Wow, the nostalgia...  Anyway, these are my personal favorites (aka episodes with a good mix of comedy and action)   42 (Best of the Best) 50/51 (Thailand special) 52/53 (Choi Minsoo) 55/56 (Female idols + scary noonas) 61/62 (China special) 69 (Choi Minsoo returns) 72/73 (Hong Kong special) 74 (Superpower race) 79 (Sherlock Holmes special) 91 (Escape the prison) 93 (Survival race) 94 (Wedding race) 95/96/97 (Park Jisung special + Superpower soccer) 100 (War of the Gods) 104 (Idol olympics) 109/110 (Park Taehwan & Son Yeonjae guests) 123/124 (Go Soo & Han Hyojoo guests)   And of course, all the Bells Hide and Seek and Find The Guest episodes are fabulous."
koreanvariety,3boy0s,Delfish,4,Wed Jul 1 04:06:34 2015 UTC,"Ep 13: SBS Building - A good early episode to start getting to know the cast members, also shows the intensity of the bells hide-and-seek.  Ep 18: Love Boat - similar reason to the one pointed above, a good episode to begin shipping the Monday Couple, not to mention the birth of Dance Club President Yoo Hyuk.  Ep 38: Yoomes Bond - The title is quite self-explanatory on why you should watch it.   Ep 52: Running Man Hunting - Iconic episode featuring Choi Min Soo, any RM fan would recommend this.  Ep 56: Don't Drink the Flower Tea - Hilarious episode, also iconic for the flower tea scene that is a running gag in the show.  Ep 60: Fool Gary - fans are overall mixed on this episode, some think it's scripted and overrated, while others think it's the greatest episode of all time. Watch and decide for yourself.  Ep 69: Grasshopper Hunting - Continuation of Running Man hunting, while not as good as the first one, it's still worth watching  Ep 74: Super Power Special - Probably my all time favorite Running Man episode, definitely a must-watch.  Ep 79: Sherlock Holmes - Odd, yet hilarious episode. Again also an iconic episode throughout the show.  Ep 94: Wedding Race - If you like K-Pop or idols, then this is a must watch. Regardless, the episode was in general a fun one.  Ep 96-97: Superpower Soccer + Asian Dream Cup - Great episodes with one of Running Man's best guest, Park Ji Sung. I believe all episodes featuring this guy is a must-watch.  Ep 104: Running Man vs. Idols Olympics - It's great seeing the cast actually working together in this one, instead of going against each other as usual.  Ep 127: Catch the Snake - Awesome guests (it has Jung Yong Hwa, also one of RM's best guest), awesome episode.   Ep 130: Reincarnation Special - Concept was very unique and the episode is regarded also as one of the best.  Ep 133-134: Secret of the Nine Swords - RM has a lot of international episode, but this is probably my favorite.  Ep 137: Marry the Fool - While it didn't feature much physical or competitive games, I still think of this as one of Running Man's funniest episode.  Ep 147: Flower Boy Athletic Championship - 2012-2013 saw many of the best RM episodes, this is one of them.  Ep 153-154: Soccer Training - It has Park Ji Sung, that alone should be enough reason.  Ep 162: Idol King Challenge - Probably the best introduction scene in Running Man history. Couldn't stop laughing watching it, awesome episode overall.  Ep 163: Princess Ji Hyo - By now you're probably a Monday Couple shipper, making this is a must-watch episode.  Ep 178: Running Man vs PD - Tear-jerking episode, don't watch this too early though, save it after you're attached to the show.  Ep 195: Idol Athletics Championship - Similar level of fun and awesomeness to the first RM vs idols concept, a great episode.  Ep 200: 2014 Asian Dream Cup - It has Park Ji Sung. Amazing episode nonetheless.  Ep 209: New Idols vs Original Idols - In my opinion, there were decent episodes in the 200s, but very few good enough for this list. This however, cuts it.  I wrote it under the impression that you've never watched or have only watched very few episodes of RM. Going chronologically is a good idea in my opinion, as you get to know and begin to love the cast better that way. I actually had more episodes in mind but had to cut several of them out."

The writing was incredibly clever and there were no guests.  EP.  84-85 I hate to admit it, because I'm not a fan of big bang or kpop (mostly because most people are unfamiliar with other, much more interesting and intellectually stimulating aspects of Korean culture...anyway...) BUT they were really great guests on the show and this episode was entirely name tag eliminations.  Happy viewing!"

koreanvariety,3bojr6,SarcasticSarcophagus,7,Tue Jun 30 22:39:58 2015 UTC,"This so much. Many other subreddits don't realize this but you get a lot more out of a text post with the link in it, since you can format and provide additional info/links. With link posts, the only benefit is only needing one click instead of two. Not to mention when you're posting to provide content to the community rather than to make the front page, the content is higher quality."
koreanvariety,3bojr6,Wyn54,1 point,Tue Jun 30 23:05:05 2015 UTC,"With link posts, the only benefit is only needing one click instead of two.   Less button clicks is desirable for the mobile format, especially for small links. But your pros of text only posts outweigh the cons."
koreanvariety,3bojr6,dancingmochi,10,Thu Jul 2 00:50:18 2015 UTC,There was a trend for awhile in which somebody would just post subbed videos for a TV show as individual link submissions but wouldn't compile all the subbed videos into a text post. You are better off posting as a self text with everything compiled and a proper heading. There is also a problem that people don't flair their own posts when users can flair their posts for their own submissions.
koreanvariety,3bojr6,hubwub,4,Tue Jun 30 23:08:45 2015 UTC,People started posting links to Korean new sites about entertainment shows too. I did it once with the news about NHC but then even tiny shows and idol related news started popping up. Keeping it text keeps it classy.
koreanvariety,3bojr6,jsrave,2,Wed Jul 1 03:49:20 2015 UTC,Do you want a subreddit filled with memes and screenshots? Because allowing link posts is how you get a subreddit filled with memes and screenshots.

koreanvariety,3biten,sportsteambfan,2,Tue Jun 30 02:28:05 2015 UTC,Pretty sure they did that because they felt bad since Sukjin was not very effective in this episode. It's not his fault; he's just unable to compete with the others physically.
koreanvariety,3biten,SpCommander,2,Tue Jun 30 23:29:34 2015 UTC,yeah that's what I figured but I still felt bad for her. She seemed like a good sport though. I didn't realize Sukjin was such a poor swimmer though.

They've tried a similar format before, only with SNS this time instead of a movie DVD, but it's worked better in other episodes. The dance scenes and pose games have great rewatchability though.

Guest were lovely and cute. Suk Jin and Have-Ryung couple might not have done much in the sense of achieving victory with the games, but they do provide funny and interesting moments to the viewers, do hope she would come back and be able to do better in the future.  Was surprise to see how Do Sang-Woo was so humble and polite, since I only know him from JiHyo's Dramaexgirlfriendclub and in the drama he plays a very obnoxious and braggy Director. He might not have said much but did do well with the games.  I find Kwang Soo and Seo Hyun-Jin particularly cute, the interaction between them is funny and shows them very comfortable.  As for the other idol guest, they are appealing in their own way. Irene Kim though was particularly quiet, was hoping to see more of her.  The games were not dragged on too long, and each game serve well in having the couples work together. Eventhough the end game was not as interesting or spectacle but it is done nicely that it didn't take long for it to end. spoiler  Eventhough I'm not a SpartAce shipper myself, there are moment's that SpartAce shipper would enjoy.  PS: JiHyo looks oh so beautiful in the blue dress at the start. Pretty and lovely as always.  The ratings for this week of RM increase a little. Let's hope it'll keep increasing. Again, this are all just my opinion and I hope I don't offend anybody, if I do, I'm sorry. Hope you guys enjoyed this week's RM and let's look forward to Next week's, seem interesting as for who the guest are."

Both ending games lacked spectacle, but at least last week had something interesting in terms of game theory.      People like to talk about RM quality, but what about context?  How does this episode fare compared to, say, E081 Gary's European Vacation?  E081 starts so slow, it's difficult to finish.  It gives Gary very little to do and commits that cardinal sin of splitting off the members to different locations to play by themselves.  At least E253 is watchable all the way through."
koreanvariety,3biten,RichRikko,2,Wed Jul 1 06:45:21 2015 UTC,"I think the difference is how rm staff believe their mud games encourage body gags and guests playing there suits how they promote those guests. Every week, RM PDs give an interview to ""look forward to this week's episode, our guests will be showing their different sides."" so what else suits better than those superstar/actresses playing dirty and physically at mud despite their ""clean/classy"" images? it's what they did to Big Bang and some of their actress guests, and will do to SNSD next week. And their Chinese counterpart did exactly the same to their top actress Fan Bingbing. Mud helps them create those extremes better than water. For example, here is a caption from next episode preview: Girls who became more ""poisonous and uglier.""  Also these mud games are different than water games because water games are common since YJS's Dangerous Invitation and Xman days. So according to the staff's obsessions, they can create a ""different type"" of games than usual. Those mud games (and mats) began around the time when the staff mentioned JSJ's body gags was something that can be taken advantage of, and falling and fighting at mud does create those ""body gags"" and ""children targeted jokes"" they like. Too bad their obsessions are still keeping those on even it's getting too much repetitive and despite they never got good receptions from viewers with it.  And about your second question, I think one comment from Korean webs would explain better:  rm's prime days were mid 2011 to early 13. nearly every episodes were good that time. but right now, chasing games, mindgames, nametags rm took pride in are gone since long ago, and only disturbingly pointless minigames are everywhere. rm has fallen to the point that you don't recognize whether it's really rm. it had 20% ratings at prime days, but they act as they are now satisfied at 10%. it's just disappointing and i should rewatch old episodes"
koreanvariety,3biten,RyuNoKami,1 point,Tue Jun 30 00:21:10 2015 UTC,"Sure, the point of mud games is about glamorous people doing unglamorous things but the whole point of RM is about glamorous people doing unglamorous things.  This isn't even limited to RM's lineage (Family Outing, X-Man, etc.) but is shared with a number of other variety TV shows (even non-Korean ones).      Given the premise that that RM's prime was 2011-2013, current RM can still be better than the worst episodes from that period.  E253 vs. E081 is just this week's example.  Ratings are a great way to measure how many people watch a show and a terrible way to measure how good a show is."
koreanvariety,3biten,CKtalon,0,Tue Jun 30 07:43:02 2015 UTC,For some reason I don't like the guy that was Ji Hyo's partner. Maybe 'coz he always plays the douche characters in his dramas or just his face.
koreanvariety,3biten,aznwhitey,3,Tue Jun 30 11:34:05 2015 UTC,"Poor guy, he have Kwang Soo's vibes for me, but its true that Ji Hyo can talk a bit more about him like Kwang Soo talks about all the people he knows."
koreanvariety,3bhadv,JKSciFi,21,Mon Jun 29 05:27:27 2015 UTC,Watched them all.Would rank seasons 1 > 3 > 2.
koreanvariety,3bhadv,nasedo22,7,Mon Jun 29 06:08:31 2015 UTC,I have the same opinion. The mystique and unknown of season 1 makes it fun.
koreanvariety,3bhadv,IncognitoAcc,3,Mon Jun 29 06:13:46 2015 UTC,ditto. Season 2 wasn't as great as Season 3. I look forward to new games that expands to different skill sets.

koreanvariety,3bhadv,TakiyaOomine,7,Mon Jun 29 06:34:48 2015 UTC,"couldnt finish season 2 after ep 6. It just reminded me of an high school with bullies vs nerds. Sucks that they even invited Yohwan, what a waste.  Season 1 was the best because they had female characters who did not act so weak and passively. Kyungran was good, and even Eunji who we all thought would just whine actually was smart and witty, and my opinion on her improved a lot throughout the games. I saw her growth. Also, the idol they invited, Sunggyu, had amazing chemistry with the cast despite being an idol."
koreanvariety,3bhadv,AIGOOOMONA,2,Tue Jun 30 00:35:04 2015 UTC,"I've never thought of it that way before, but yeah... I think that's why Season 2 left such a bad taste in my mouth. Because it was exactly what you described-- bullies vs. nerds. With the celebrities and broadcasters on one side, ganging up against poor stuttering, awkward, bespectacled Doo-hee on the other. Which essentially undermines the whole point of The Genius game.   EDIT: also yeah, across all 3 seasons of The Genius, Kyung-ran has been by far and away the best female player. What I love about her is that she's also not overly fussed about managing her image."
koreanvariety,3bhadv,concreteroads,3,Tue Jun 30 01:05:51 2015 UTC,"I dont know why they just hire pretty faces, when I am pretty sure there are plenty of smart and charismatic Korean women. Season 3 girls were underwhelming too, guys just treated them like bimbos lol"
koreanvariety,3bhadv,AIGOOOMONA,7,Tue Jun 30 02:32:08 2015 UTC,"It's not that the girls they've casted aren't geniuses in their own right. Jung-moon has a genius level IQ for example, and was incredibly quick at Gyul-hap pattern recognition, but was ultimately underwhelming in S1. Similarly, Cha Yu-ram lasted really long in season 1... but she never showed anything exceptional. She survived because she was sweet and harmless and didn't make enemies and until she got eliminated by Eun-ji, the majority would usually help her through the death match.   I think it's more that most girls, especially the younger ones, have their image to preserve. They can't be as vicious as the older ladies, such as Kyung-ran, Yoon-sun, or Su-jin can be. They also constantly underplay their own abilities-- Ah-young basically cultivated her own ditz image, and Ha Yeon-joo in the same season shot herself in the foot with her lack of confidence that worked well in earlier rounds but failed epically in her death match. Pretty much all of the younger women, even the clever ones, have adopted the same strategy across all seasons of The Genius--whip out the aegyo and hope the best male players keep them safe as much as possible. Anyone who hasn't played along--e.g. Jaekyung in S2, who tried to break off from the alliance--is quickly eliminated.   Also you're right, the guys are part of the problem. S3 was especially bad in this regard, but some of the other returning players (e.g. Jin-ho, I love you, but you do not treat women nicely lol) are also pretty chauvinistic. They enter the game assuming the women are airheads who need protection, so it's no wonder the women don't do anything to prove otherwise."

koreanvariety,3bhadv,UnseenAlchemist,3,Mon Jun 29 14:59:12 2015 UTC,"currently in the process of rewatching S2, which is taking a very long time to complete.  Jinho made S1 shine, S2 is a mess, S3 had lots of brilliant moments but IMO none of those compare to ""that"" moment in S1.  S1>=S3>S2"
koreanvariety,3bhadv,joeblitzkrieg,2,Mon Jun 29 15:10:43 2015 UTC,Watched the entirety of seasons 1 and 3. Rewatched season 1 a whole bunch; I'm actually in the middle of rewatching it with someone who has never watched the show before. I watched all of season 2 except for the season finale.   Season 1 is still my favorite because it was fresh and new. Season 3 is a close second because it had some of my favorite players from the whole history of the show.
koreanvariety,3bhadv,onemorelight,2,Mon Jun 29 06:25:33 2015 UTC,"I watched season 1 and 2, loved season 1. Season 2 had a few people that annoyed the hell out of me. So I ended up skipping through most episodes."
koreanvariety,3bhadv,KimGG,2,Mon Jun 29 06:27:55 2015 UTC,"Watched all because the Japanese Liar Game was the first Asian Drama I ever watched and I was hooked after the first few episodes. After that I watched everything related to Liar Game and after I heard there is a tv show with this concept I had to watch it. (and everyone should watch Liar Game, even the Korean Version of it is great)  My season rating: 1>3>2  In season 2 Hong-chul annoyed me from the start. Season 1 had great contestants."
koreanvariety,3bhadv,HealerKeeper,3,Mon Jun 29 09:58:54 2015 UTC,"I also started watching The Genius because of Liar Game, but I read the manga first before I went on to the drama. Although the original Japanese version was the classic, I agree the adapted Korean version was not too shabby and some changes to the storyline made it more refreshing than merely rehashing the original.  Watched all three seasons of TG but only re-watched S1 and S3. S2 was off-putting for obvious reasons so I decided to spare myself from the agony."
koreanvariety,3bhadv,femacca,2,Mon Jun 29 14:29:47 2015 UTC,I did watch 2 seasons.

I watched S1, S2E01-03, and S3. May go back to finish S2 just to see what games they have. I've watched the Japanese Liar Game and read the manga too, so it's surprising I didn't catch onto this show earlier."

koreanvariety,3bhadv,concreteroads,1 point,Mon Jun 29 13:57:04 2015 UTC,Watched all three and have to agree that season1 was super fun because it was something new.

The below answers are not influenced by its outcome as I already made some predictions of my own for fun before S4 started.   Who do you expect the most from this season?    Hyunmin, Jinho and Dongmin. (I think they still have more to show as individuals)   Who do you expect the least from this season?    Kyunghoon and Yoonsun. (Kyunghoon is just a cray cray destroying the game for everyone - easily the worst contestant to have joined TG ever. Yoonsun is just not suited for TG - she always feels out of place during games and in any alliances. I can almost feel people being awkward around her like they didn't know whether to talk to her or pretend she's not there)   Who do you think will be the most 'disappointing' contestant?    Kyunghoon. (I always have a hard time holding back the urge to punch his face every time I see him, so I wish for his swift elimination, if he has not been out by E1)   Who do you think will be the most 'surprising' contestant?    Junseok. (He had the most desire and drive to prove himself after the disastrous S1E1, and he showed some potential when guesting in S2)"
koreanvariety,3bhyzd,femacca,3,Mon Jun 29 14:43:55 2015 UTC,"Haha, I feel like to enjoy Kyung-hoon's presence (whether it's as a player or as one of us, a casual viewer), you need to just not take him seriously. Like, at all-- no fcks given. Yeah, he screws up all the games, which does get annoying (and I can imagine it's only more annoying for the actual players) but unlike Lim Yo-hwan, who had to resort to getting on his knees and begging, at least Titty God is entertaining lol. In a shameless, crazy way.   Jang Dong-min and Choi Yeon-seung seem to have perfected this art of just ignoring Kyung-hoon, but the players from other seasons are sure to have a lot of frustration in their paths before they learn how to deal with him (or until he gets eliminated haha)."
koreanvariety,3bhyzd,concreteroads,3,Mon Jun 29 16:52:52 2015 UTC,"Kyunghoon is an interesting character.

I think the best part about Kyunghoon is that his mouth is always whining about how he wants to win... (and he gets so emotional about it too!) but then his actions just. Make. No. Sense. From a variety perspective, I love him. My competitive tabletop gamer self hates him with a burning passion."

koreanvariety,3bhyzd,concreteroads,6,Tue Jun 30 15:26:32 2015 UTC,"i think junghyun would find it tough on the get go, he might be the one eliminated. winner might be hyunmin. based on the press conference bts it seems like ""titty god"" stirred some shit again, i think he was the one who angered jinho in the preview which led to junghyun ending up as an elimination candidate. just a feeling.  i expect hyunmin/jinho/dongmin to be the main figures for the rest of the season, with sangmin and maybe kyungran to influence things behind the scene. i dont expect much from the troll duo lol.  'disappointing', i'm hoping i'm wrong but kyungran. i have a high expectation for her that i cant help but feel i'll be disappointed.  'surprising', definitely junseok. i think he'll sooner or later join up with jinho and show what he's about.... if not he'll probably join up with yoohyun/yeonseung/junghyun who all bear bitter feelings towards the four favourites."

Yeah I thought this too! Although I don't like Kyunghoon and don't think he will make it far, I didn't pick him to be the most likely eliminated in episode 1. Jinho's reaction to him in the press conference BTS video (""he's even bigger trash than I saw!"") made me think Kyunghoon did something. Like he probably managed to survive an episode or two, which pissed off players, maybe? Just my guess."

Episode 1 Winner: Hyun-min or the girls' alliance  Episode 1 Elimination: (urg I think Jin-ho might actually get kicked out early... I really want him to stay though so. no jinxing) Kyung-hoon unless he gets lucky in main match, or unless producers decide to save him for pure entertainment factor [also based on the press conference, it doesn't seem like kyung-hoon gets eliminated early enough for the other players' tastes lol]  Who do I expect the most from: Choi Yeon-seung & Oh Hyun-min, since they both have a lot to prove and probably some bitterness from previous seasons. Also Yoo-hyun-- I'm hoping he can show more of his skills this time around, since he was a little underwhelming in S3  Who do I expect the least from: Hong Jin-ho and Jang Dong-min, not because I don't love them, but because I think they're going to have a tough uphill climb to be successful this season. (Sang-min doesn't have the same winner's curse, because again. Survival skill of cockroach.)   Most disappointing: Lim Yo-hwan (he didn't show much in his season and I doubt he will this time around either... 0 victories is pretty incredible in its own way) & Choi Jung-moon (cute and harmless, and smarter than she displayed in S1, but still not at the same level as most other players this season IMO)   Most surprising: Yoon-sun (I think she learned a lot from S2 and could go as far as Kyung-ran this season) & Hyun-min (we already know he's extraordinary, a genius player, but he has the potential to win it all this season now that he's grown up a bit)"

I did watch the introduction because I couldn't wait, and wanted to see the players walk in and interact.    Who I think will win in Episode 1: I have in mind several people who I think could win, but for the sake of picking a sole winner, I'll pick Oh Hyunmin. I think he'll play well and be sociable to boot. Judging from the Press conference BTS, he has a bromance with Jinho, so I think the older players have a soft spot for him. Who I think will be eliminated in Episode 1: There're several players I don't think will make it far in the season - Yohwan, Kyunghoon, Jungmoon, Yoonsun. Of these, I think Yoonsun is probably going first.   and for the whole season questions!   Who do I expect most from:  I think Hyunmin! I wanna see the kid win the whole season. I wanna see Jinho and Hyunmin go head-to-head, like we got a taste of in the Monorail ""extra round"" BTS video. It'd be exciting to see them on opposite alliances, trying to strategize against each other. Who do I expect the least from: honestly, Jungmoon and Kyunghoon are all-stars? both may be very brainy people but didn't impress on their seasons. Who do I think will be the most ""diappointing"": Junghyun. He is one of my favorites from season 2, and I like his personality. But among this line-up, I think he'll disappoint. Jungmoon, too. Who do I think will be the most ""surprising"": Junseok. He was only a contestant on one episode, in season 1; did appear as guest later. There's not much to expect because we haven't seen much of him, so he can only surprise us."

For right now, I think people are going to be hitching themselves to the Hyunmin train, so I'll go with him. Going to go way, way out on a limb: Sangmin. He has a giant target on his back and isn't good 1v1. Hyunmin. Already the best at the games, and has a whole season of experience at the social stuff. Not Kyunghoon, for once! I'm going to go with Junghyun. He was good at very little other than listening to Sangmin. Given my answer to #2, obviously Sangmin. I almost want to say Kyunghoon just because everyone thinks he'll go out first. More seriously, maybe Yoohyun, he's good and can hopefully get some people around him sooner. He could finish #2."

Uh, oh...   KBS drama Orange Marmalade hits a low of 2.5% on its 8th episode. Two episodes ago, it hit a high of 4.9%.    Viewer comments about the drama haven't changed all that much so the drop might have been a fluke. Four more episodes to go.  SBS Oh My Baby and Star King were negatively affected by SBS's decision to air a baseball game last week. Compare the ratings from June 13 and June 27.   New shows!   KBS drama Remember You / Hello Monster gets a 4.7% rating on both of its episodes.   A drop from last week's 7.5% and 8.2% by School 2015. However, School 2015 started off with 3.8% and 4.2%.   Mnet Show Me the Money 4 starts off at 1.548%.    Season 3's highest rating was a 1.436% on its 3rd episode (out of 10 total).  KBS Do As You Wish (네 멋대로 해라) aired its one episode pilot for a 5.8% rating. It beat SBS Same Bed, Different Dreams by 0.3%.    Strong candidate for become a full-time show. The flow of the show and its execution was one of the best out of the KBS pilots. Chemistry between the MCs was praised by viewers. MCs: Jung Hyung-don and Ahn Jung-hwan, Panel: Hong Jin-kyung, Kwang Hee, Eun Ji-won, celebrity stylist Kim Sung-il Fashion variety show where Korean celebrities have to choose their own outfits without the help of their coordinators/stylists. Sung Si-kyung, Moon Hee-jun, Kangnam, and 2PM's Ok Taecyeon were subjects.  SBS drama The Time We Were Not in Love replaces Divorce Lawyer in Love. The 6.7% rating on its debut episode was a 2.5% improvement over its predecessor. tvN The Genius: Grand Final starts off at 1.802%.    Black Garnet debuted at 1.266%, hit a high of 1.879% (E08), hit a low of 1.008% (E10), and concluded at 1.257% (E12).    Finales/Hiatus   JTBC Crime Scene 2 concluded with a 1.536% rating on its 12th episode. (13, if you count episode 0)   Best rating: 1.678% (E11). Worst rating: 1.051% (E01). (Episode 0 got 0.672%)   tvN SNL Korea Season 6 will resume airing after The Genius ends its season.   KBS pilots   Breaking from the long-time tradition of only showing pilots in spring and autumn, KBS will continue to shower us with a flurry of pilot shows. Bring it on KBS.  That new variety revolving around celebrities and their siblings, We Are Siblings (우리는 형제입니다), changed its Korean title to 우애를 위해.   EXID's Hani and her younger brother are still confirmed to appear. Comedian Yoo Min-sang and his younger sibling have joined the show. The show will air sometime in July.  Starting on July 3, there will be a 2 week pilot called 후계자 (which can be translated to Heir).   It is a trot audition program that will be hosted by the Do Kyung-wan / Jang Yoon-jung couple.  Global Husband (글로벌 남편백서 내편, 남편) aired an episode on Thursday at 9 PM, which got a 3.6% rating. It will air one more episode this coming week.   This variety show follows the lives of foreign men who married Korean women.  KBS's new soccer variety show, Youth FC (청춘FC) will start airing on July 11.   The show, hosted by former soccer player Ahn Jung-hwan, revolves around those who have failed to achieve their dream of becoming a professional soccer player. The best players will be taken to Europe for extensive training.  Lady Action (레이디액션), Great Recipe (대단한 레시피), Looking Back at Myself (나를 돌아봐), and Exciting India (두근두근 인도) aired in April~June and they are still in the mix.    To be honest, Great Recipe and Exciting India don't stand a chance at becoming regular programs with their 1~2% ratings.    Upcoming News   tvN drama Oh My Ghost (오 나의 귀신님) will start airing on July 3, taking over Ex-Girlfriend Club's old spot.   Main cast: Park Bo-young, Cho Jung-seok. Other: Lim Ju-hwan, Kim Seul-gi, Park Jung-ah.  Yoo Jae Suk's show on JTBC will air sometime in August. It's his first venture in to cable. The main producer of the show worked with Yoo Jae Suk on Happy Together back in the day.   Notes   I created a ""~9:40 PM"" category for Saturdays to accommodate The Genius.      Did I miss anything important? Please add to the list! Feel free to make requests, suggestions, criticisms, comments.     edit 1 (4:40 PM EST): Added ""KBS Pilot"" and ""Upcoming"" section."

koreanvariety,3bfl5t,deoxix,1 point,Mon Jun 29 01:16:58 2015 UTC,Is it just me or this week there has been a lot of change in ratings this week? Normally most ratings are stable but this week i see ups and downs of 1-2% in a lot of programs. Are people taking summer holidays now so some shows are most seen than before?
koreanvariety,3bfl5t,deoxix,4,Sun Jun 28 21:30:10 2015 UTC,"I don't see anything out of the ordinary. Monday through Friday looks stable.

koreanvariety,3bfl5t,Bandmanager1,8,Sun Jun 28 23:46:27 2015 UTC,"Wow! Shoutout to 1 Night 2 Days for bringing the heat with even better ratings than last week! 18%! Totally deserving as they seriously brought some all-star guests (MGY & PBY are sooo cute) and the cast works so well around them.  Now 3 Meals A Day...10+% on cable HOLY moly. That's like 30+%~ equivalent on PB. Na PD is making history over here, I can't wait to watch the episode with BoA & Yoo Hae Jin!"
koreanvariety,3bfl5t,stijnx,6,Mon Jun 29 00:38:18 2015 UTC,"Since this coming week is the last episode of Abnormal Summit before the cast change, I wonder what the percentages will look like the next 2 weeks"

koreanvariety,3bfl5t,Warlord_X,4,Sun Jun 28 23:48:00 2015 UTC,18% damn... King of Masked Singer is rising steadily as well!
koreanvariety,3bfl5t,nasedo22,3,Mon Jun 29 00:36:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah. Rising so spectacularly and coming to just 1.4% behind Return of the Superman is impressive. I suspect it'll be even higher next week, because it will be when Cleopatra gives his performance and people are eager to see if he will be crowned King for the 4th time. Kim Yeon Woo, please hold on to the throne!"

koreanvariety,3bfl5t,Hobok3n,1 point,Tue Jun 30 16:07:35 2015 UTC,"Pretty sad that they are getting so low ratings. But then again, the show wont be taken off air anytime soon as they are raking in money from china  and various product placements in the show."
koreanvariety,3bfl5t,repmule111,-3,Mon Jun 29 05:19:45 2015 UTC,Next week if RM rating its below 12 % that will be an absolute failure.
koreanvariety,3bfl5t,bduddy,1 point,Mon Jun 29 00:11:06 2015 UTC,Thing is I don't really think it's their fault. 1N2D is just on a roll right now. Running Man will probably be around 10% until viewers get bored and switch back.
koreanvariety,3bfl5t,aziaddict,-5,Mon Jun 29 07:09:51 2015 UTC,"Same here. I am lost too. 1N2D is good and funny. RM is as good as 1N2D if not any better. The only difference is 1N2D is a 3 weeks long project, people following the story, so they want to watch it as soon as it airs. RM is one week ep, people do not have much expectation, so they can watch it online later, maybe?"

Jinho winning is the odd one out and I guarantee he won't win this time for that exact reason."
koreanvariety,3benre,spritorac,4,Thu Jul 2 08:09:00 2015 UTC,"Maybe I misphrased my side note. I'm not saying that social play is an incorrect or is a bad way to play the game. I respect Sangmin and Dongmin of how they were able to appeal to others and set up the good relationships with the right people throughout the different games in the previous seasons. I am fine with games with distinct teams with similar amounts of people which allows plenty of room for team play, negotiation, and deception/backstabbing. However I really don't see the fun or the ""genius element"" when a huge majority of the players decide to team up without one or two people, leaving room for no counterplay. The only way that this kind of lock situation is broken is if someone from the main group backstabs and decides to help the left out straggler(s).  spoiler  Also, being a Jinho fan makes me sad reading your last sentence :("

koreanvariety,3benre,sportsteambfan,4,Mon Jun 29 05:40:54 2015 UTC,THIS. I hate it so much. They need eliminate this because players keep teaming up with each other and one team will usually dominate the game and it makes things boring.
koreanvariety,3benre,dancingmochi,3,Tue Jun 30 02:35:16 2015 UTC,"it's useful at the beginning of a season, if 1 person or a minority betrays the majority in a dirty way. that would force players to be more strategic about how to win against the majority without entirely losing their trust. (imagine if kyunghoon went to death match in 1st episode S3)"
koreanvariety,3benre,sportsteambfan,3,Tue Jun 30 15:47:05 2015 UTC,Right but I think instead of more strategic they tend to be more cautious/timid and not rock the boat which inevitably leads to their downfall as people are picked off one by one

koreanvariety,3benre,JKSciFi,1 point,Thu Jul 2 05:01:22 2015 UTC,i think that's due to it being early in the season and everyone trying to get in the right alliance and avoid being targeted. hopefully that will improve as the season progresses

koreanvariety,3bklr9,chillingwithavillain,11,Tue Jun 30 00:05:39 2015 UTC,She hasn't changed.
koreanvariety,3bklr9,dacrocyte,4,Tue Jun 30 00:16:13 2015 UTC,"Just to add on to that, there were also a few more ""Bad Jihyo"" moments in the latest RM ep: the spoiler in the intro and these two (1 and 2) later on.  Directed at the OP since it'd be pointless to add this in a separate reply: But /u/jsrave's comment is pretty accurate regarding JH's screentime when female guests are on, though it's pretty much always been like that with the exception of a few episodes. Ep. 219 happens to be one of my favorite episodes in regard to her screentime, especially since her screentime wasn't longer just because of a ""Bad Jihyo"" moment, but because of other clips like her spontaneously dancing to ""Hot Issue"" and her taking care of the female guests in the foreground of the footage (rather than just the background)."
koreanvariety,3bklr9,amelisa28,1 point,Tue Jun 30 02:21:57 2015 UTC,its not that shes changed completely and she doesnt do it anymore.   but you can tell that shes holding back more on the angry jihyo character and i think shes getting less screen time for awhile now.
koreanvariety,3bklr9,ilangshot,4,Tue Jun 30 00:22:25 2015 UTC,Its more so RM PD's imo. They keep trying to try new things that don't seem to work-Like the last 2 episodes with their weird transitions and stuff.   It also seems like they're cutting back on Ji Hyo heavily whenever female guests come out. I doubt we'll see her much when SNSD comes on.
koreanvariety,3bklr9,jsrave,1 point,Tue Jun 30 01:27:59 2015 UTC,"The teams are set for 5 groups of three for the SNSD retro games episode....honestly I was thinking they should have done like a ""scorned lover"" type thing where the guys are bound via paper chain or glove or whatever like the other couple races and Jihyo goes after them as a chaser. I think that'd be awesome and she'd get her well deserved screentime being the only antagonist. Alas, it was not to be. Hopefully she gets her fair share."

koreanvariety,3bklr9,SpCommander,-2,Tue Jun 30 03:50:08 2015 UTC,Never said she did. I meant that she used to be so active as a member before and now whether its the editing or the PD it seems like she takes the backseat a lot of times. She needs to be boisterous and bad ass.
koreanvariety,3bklr9,Hitokiri2,7,Wed Jul 1 04:25:28 2015 UTC,I think it's just the way Running Man is cut and the games that have been played lately. Jihyo does best when there are parts of the show just dedicated to the cast fooling around but instead the show concentrates on the games much more. Plus Jihyo wins usually came when it was problem solving mixed with a little physical play. Lately it's been more about running in farm fields and playing the in the mud. Jihyo also doesn't do well in sports games as dodge ball as well.   I think this is the same reason why Gary doesn't get as much face time as well. He does well in individual or 1 vs all situations. They hadn't had one of those in a very long time.
koreanvariety,3bklr9,Reyvaan,4,Tue Jun 30 02:03:25 2015 UTC,"she just doesn't have a huge ego and wants everything to be about her.  it is pretty obvious that she tones it down so as not to embarrass the guests and she tries her best to help out guests, especially if they are young girls who doesn't really have much variety experience"

koreanvariety,3bklr9,Isketam,2,Tue Jun 30 16:51:44 2015 UTC,"Her persona and 'role' (Blank Ji, Angry Ji, Running Ace, ex-MC) are best if not being overused in each episodes.  I like the way she is now, although that means less screen time for her. Plus I think she's taking this opportunity to relax herself a little bit after finished filming 'Ex-Girlfriend Club' drama."

koreanvariety,3beob4,deoxix,14,Sun Jun 28 15:09:14 2015 UTC,"crime scene 2 really sets the bar up high if there'll really be crime scene 3. i think it's hard to come up with casts like in season 2 : both deduction and variety elements are well-balanced. there you have deduction king, acting queen, bromance(s), siblings-like fight, some funny and adorkable moments here and there, and so on. it's all perfect.  what improved most for me is their chemistry. i know that we can only see what CS2 staffs choose what we can see, but i can tell that the casts are like family by now and they're close. and also i really like jiyoon's character in season 2. before, she was really ambitious and can be a bit pushover to others especially hyunmoo and that can be uncomfortable to watch at times, but now she's delightful to watch and still be sharp in her deductions.   i have stated this before in previous thread, that i'm most surprised with jang jin. perhaps it's because i didn't know him before so i didn't expect anything from him, but then he managed to be the most outstanding player among the five casts. he's smart and his imagination can give him the edge.   i would really love to have crime scene 3. if the casts are able to deduct well and have amazing chemistry, i don't mind having new players for season 3 (but please, PLEASE, bring back jang jin and jinho! lol)"
koreanvariety,3beob4,natcookie,6,Sun Jun 28 15:54:01 2015 UTC,I agree! The cast was much better in season 2 in terms of chemistry and how sharp they are in deducting. Tbh I feel like deduction idiots ruin the show a bit—like when Hyunmoo was a guest in season 2 and he didn't really seem to try very hard finding clues.. I would love for them to keep the same cast for a new season since I think they really all fit together superbly :) AND MORE JINHO! Hehe
koreanvariety,3beob4,sundaymorninq,2,Sun Jun 28 17:29:13 2015 UTC,"the chemistry between the casts is superb, it's hard to match that. you'll think they've been together for years when it's actually 3-4 months or so."
koreanvariety,3beob4,natcookie,5,Sun Jun 28 18:13:48 2015 UTC,"Something they removed in S2 was the 1v1 interrogations which I actually quite liked in S1, and instead we get the detective interrogating everyone. Personally I'm not sure if I like the detective role; I feel like there's more fun to be had when everyone can be the murderer. From the producer's standpoint I can definitely understand it though; the detective dictates the pace of the show and allows it to run more smoothly."
koreanvariety,3beob4,x3Clawy,5,Sun Jun 28 17:10:54 2015 UTC,"Season 2 detective = Season 1's unrelated role in each episode (there was pretty much always 1 person who would always be ruled out from the start), so they cut the need to write up another role and put him in, which in my opinion is a great move as the quality of the other roles improved (or maybe their writing just improved)"
koreanvariety,3beob4,Sylencia,2,Sun Jun 28 17:48:22 2015 UTC,"The detective also summarizes all the clues gathered thus far so that everyone is on the same page and can make an informed vote. They're sort of like the MC of the episode (much better alternative to HyunMoo doing it in season 1). I really enjoyed the debates they had during the final sit-down discussions, and I feel the detectives were largely responsible for steering those to wherever they led (even if the editing might not have shown it every time).  Also, it could also have been devised as a preventive measure. If all the suspects voted in a circle and each received 1 vote, they'd end up in a stalemate (I know it's unlikely, but not impossible). Sure, they'll then be asked to decide amongst themselves, but look at how crazy and long that discussion got in the villa murder. The detective's vote/s ensures that doesn't happen."
koreanvariety,3beob4,cdrmarcus,5,Tue Jun 30 08:31:34 2015 UTC,"Although the cast looked like a disparate bunch, they had amazing chemistry from early on. The guests also seemed to integrate well despite most of them only appearing for just an episode. The best improvement for S2 was adapting the S1E10 format for the entire season, i.e. giving the cast the role cards in advance so they had more time to prepare. That helped them to immerse in their roles and thus they could portray their roles more convincingly.   Jang Jin was such a gem. I thought he would be distant given his esteemed director status, but he gradually let his hair down and played along with the rest. His roles were the best and most  memorable, like Bookstore, Violent, Member... and his lovelines aplenty - Romantic Jang indeed.  Jang Dongmin's FM Jang was so iconic. He also had a criminal face so was a ready candidate for those unsure who to vote for. His frequent bursting out in screams eventually influenced Hani to do the same later in the season, haha.  I was satisfied with Hani's performance given that this is her first solo fixed variety. She might not have a high accuracy rate, but she was so entertaining and cute, and I like how she didn't seem to care much about her image by walking splay-footed and laughing heartily. The Fairy Ha 'wara wara' with the calculator on her head was the best moment.   As for the two seasoned members, Jiyoon ditched her sharp image from S1 to a more entertaining and likeable one in S2. Park Jazz, Park Kangnam (haha!), Park Sasaeng, Sexy Park...all so memorable. I find Jinho a little inconsistent but he was hilarious as shat with occasional jibes and that familiar mumble mumble. I love the squabbles between him and Dongmin.   Such a well-rounded cast, I don't know what more to ask for. S3 please come soon! And get Kim Jihoon as the perm cast already! I want to see Sakarin-chan part II!"
koreanvariety,3beob4,femacca,7,Mon Jun 29 15:19:17 2015 UTC,"I've watched all of Crime Scene 1 & 2, minus the final episode (since subs are out soon, yay!). While I thoroughly enjoyed both seasons, Crime Scene 2 is the one that really captured my heart.   The first episode was a bit anticlimactic (it would've been more entertaining to see them tossed directly into a gory murder like in the first season), since what I grew to love about this season's cast was their fantastic chemistry with each other. I didn't like Jiyoon in season 1, but she toned it down and had a great rapport with the others this season. Jin-ho was fantastic, but the greatest surprise was seeing how great the new cast additions were. Overall the cast was much better at deductions than the last season (Jang Jin is awesome!), but they were also a lot funnier (Hani and Jang Dong-min's characters were pretty much the bomb). I loved the absurd lovelines, the puns they made from the suspects' names (Violent Jang, Fairy Ha, Innocent Kim), and the constant inside jokes/easter eggs to be found.   This season also benefited a lot from some great guests, notably Kim Ji Hoon. That man is comic gold. I also liked Jun Hyun-moo and NS Yoonji better as guests than as permanent S1 members.   They also improved a lot format-wise from Season 1. Pacing was a lot tighter and the audience gets to see more of the scene/the deductions, which is awesome. One thing I do miss is the creepy directives/voiceover instructions that used to guide the cast-- I jumped pretty much every time the voice sounded. I also thought the ""additional evidence""--stuff like DNA testing, or CCTV footage--that they had in Season 1 really contributed a lot to the case. Like /u/x3Clawy, I'm also not the biggest fan of the detective role. I think it's great when they bring in an actual detective to serve that role, but for the most part if there's only 6 members, I'd rather see them as criminals. The 1v1 interrogation always felt pretty useless to me, both between criminals and when it's detective+criminal-- basically no major deductions have ever come out of those interrogations, plus it's a detriment for the detective to be stuck inside the room instead of out finding clues.   I really, really hope they do a Season 3! The ratings for the last few episodes were pretty good. I know it's really unlikely, but I want them to bring back the season 2 cast, because they were freaking fantastic together. And if they have to make changes, pleeeease add Kim Ji-Hoon-- some of the standout characters and moments of this season were his (Sakarin-channnn~), and he's actually pretty smart at finding clues and making deductions (and hiding as the criminal!), even if he sometimes doubts himself and votes wrong in the end."
koreanvariety,3beob4,concreteroads,6,Sun Jun 28 17:35:33 2015 UTC,Just watched the final episode of season 2 and I like how things ended at the end of season 2 better than 1. spoiler
koreanvariety,3beob4,unholydaemon,5,Sun Jun 28 19:13:39 2015 UTC,"Is it sad to say I cried at the end?  I really cannot see any other cast members other than these five. I love them so much. It's funny because at the start I disliked Jang Jin and Dongmin, but they really grew on me. Probably my two favorites of the cast.  Please Crime Scene 3!"
koreanvariety,3beob4,gorilladanny,3,Mon Jun 29 03:36:36 2015 UTC,My absolute favorite thing this season was how the cast doted on each other. Their banter was always delighting to watch.
koreanvariety,3beob4,juhli_a,6,Sun Jun 28 21:03:06 2015 UTC,"S2 has been much better than S1. They have set the bar pretty high for S3, if there's one. I think having someone play the detective was a good decision because it means at least one person will be impartial and have no reason to hide anything. Even if you are not the criminal, there are things you don't want to reveal because it may cast more suspicions on yourself. The strong chemistry between the cast members was definitely one of the highlights of the season.  Everyone played their roles really well and there were a lot of memorable characters and moments.  I think the cast enjoyed it too because there were lots of inside jokes and references to earlier episodes. I don't listen Kpop or follow idol groups, but Hani is so damn cute.  From her excitement when catching the criminal to this, she has been a treat to watch. And that up and down song is stuck in my head. If there were any low points in the season, I would say it's that time where one of suspects was a dead guy, who happened to be the guest. I think the production was anticipating one of the cast members to pick that role but that's the luck of the draw sometimes. The second victim was an nice idea but the execution didn't work. Maybe it would've been better if the second victim was murdered during the investigation. Overall, this has been a great season and I hope there will be a S3."
koreanvariety,3beob4,dattroll123,2,Tue Jun 30 00:24:07 2015 UTC,"Jang Jin was the best addition to the cast, the guy was very sharp and imaginative. I think the criminal capture rate this season was better then last year's right?   There isn't a single cast member that I consider ""filler"", everyone brought something to the table. It's also great that both jinho and Dongmin are in this, would make the Genius Season 4 more interesting with these 2 already doing shows with  each other.   One minor complain I have is that the editors should change how they reveal whether the selected criminal is right or wrong.  Everytime it is right they immediately show the criminal's face, if not the announcer would say it's wrong. Minor, but I'd like for that to be consistent"

koreanvariety,3be2jl,sundaymorninq,6,Sun Jun 28 10:09:37 2015 UTC,"Not that I know of, unless you live in Korea. The producers of shows with large international fanbases are well aware of their popularity overseas, but sadly I don't think they can renew a season based on the wishes of the international fans who watch it from online subbers.  I don't know if MBC, KBS or SBS stream variety shows (I know MBC streams Show! Music Core, but that's a live show so it's different), but I don't think watching it online would contribute to ratings. Watching on an official site would also mean watching shows raw, so there's also that. Sorry! :("
koreanvariety,3be2jl,Rhunyn,2,Sun Jun 28 10:36:43 2015 UTC,"Haha, I realised it would be raw but I figured I wouldn't mind just letting it play in the background while I do other stuff just to help the ratings xD"
koreanvariety,3be2jl,deoxix,3,Sun Jun 28 17:17:35 2015 UTC,If you're talking about straight ratings it's essentially impossible because you not only have to see it on a tv in korea but you need to have one with a audience meter.   But nowadays there are a lot more statistics for this like the program engagement index (PEI) and others than can measure people (just koreans i think) watching the shows online. The most important thing to see if the program is going well is looking for how well they're selling their ad spaces and at what price.
koreanvariety,3be2jl,eIworld,3,Sun Jun 28 13:13:09 2015 UTC,"Ah, it's always puzzled me how they even measured viewer ratings in the first place, I never knew there was such a thing as audience meters. I'm keeping my fingers crossed but at the same time, there's only so far a show like The Genius can go before it goes downhill, unless they reuse most of the games and only occasionally invent new ones."
koreanvariety,3be2jl,sirrenitee,3,Sun Jun 28 17:22:59 2015 UTC,A korean I chat with on twitter told me the rating was 1.8% for the first episode. Wich aparently is high there.
koreanvariety,3be2jl,sirrenitee,0,Sun Jun 28 15:09:50 2015 UTC,"Wow, really? That's great news! But I can't figure how 1.8% is high... How much more popular would a show have to be to get like ratings of 80%? :/"
koreanvariety,3be2jl,saramdapgae,8,Sun Jun 28 17:20:20 2015 UTC,"Ratings are based on Live TV viewing. Percentage is usually based on an estimate of the population with access to a TV. 1.8% is almost 1 million viewers based on a total population of 50 million. The problem for The Genius is that it is on cable, not everyone pays for it. So reaching 80% impossible.   Edit: 1.8% is a good debut. Hope the fans will make it go up.  Edit2: tvN rating potential: not a good comparison since they are dramas not varieties/different time slots. Reply 1994 highest was 12% and Miseng was 8%."
koreanvariety,3be2jl,Siantlark,2,Sun Jun 28 20:03:47 2015 UTC,https://www.reddit.com/r/koreanvariety/comments/3bfl5t/201506220628_monsun_variety_show_ratings/  Read the OP's comments for the rating analysis. 3 Meals a Day is doing very well as a variety in tvN but it is very different show compare to The Genius.
koreanvariety,3be2jl,eIworld,1 point,Sun Jun 28 22:20:50 2015 UTC,"Ah right, it completely slipped my mind that tvN was a cable network.. yea I can imagine that 3 Meals a Day is much more popular—I'll be crossing my fingers that the ratings for The Genius 4 will be good enough for a fifth season."

koreanvariety,3baw3c,deathshotx,5,Sun Jun 28 07:09:28 2015 UTC,"Agree about the decline starting at that time (170-180) the year before was still ""okay"" but after that time, good episodes became the exception and the cast got so bored with themselves which made it very hard to keep up with the show. Nowadays im 7 episodes behind and dont miss anything.   I think that its hard to rate single episodes but usually if one would rewatch that episode its a good one. I watched the older episodes 3 times (in over 3 years) and dont even want to watch the new episodes once."

koreanvariety,3baw3c,DFu4ever,0,Sat Jun 27 15:34:48 2015 UTC,The quality is not the point at all. The point is that they didn't want to watch this over 2D1N for example. I don't think they needed word of mouth because it was a program of yoo god that in 2010 was already pretty much famous. The public likes more the stuff they did in 2013 that in 2010.

koreanvariety,3bavxx,qazwaxedc,15,Sat Jun 27 13:30:08 2015 UTC,"Nope, because they'll always get compared to YJS. People in general prefer nostalgia over new things. Plus YJS has the benefit of being the MC of one of the historical variety shows in IC, following that up with really good performances on FO, RM among older shows as well.   You'd have to be the MC of a new greatest show and have several shows to even reach his level, and frankly no one is close."
koreanvariety,3bavxx,jsrave,5,Sat Jun 27 15:17:53 2015 UTC,"As long as he is still alive, probably not. He's what people consider the ""standard"" of being an MC and everyone gravitates towards his style."
koreanvariety,3bavxx,_Dantes_Inporno_,1 point,Sat Jun 27 18:07:11 2015 UTC,I think this post hits it right on the head. As long as YJS is alive and active he's going to be tough to beat. Once YJS retires or slows down then and only then can we see who takes over as The Nation's Emcee.
koreanvariety,3bavxx,Hitokiri2,8,Mon Jun 29 11:55:35 2015 UTC,"Yes and no. His impact can't be understated but as time passes on, the new generation will respect him in a way but won't really connect with him. Someone else will be the voice of that generation. I guess I think of Johnny Carson. I respect Carson but I didn't grow up watching him and will never have the same reverence for him that older generations have. Carson impacted a whole generation of comedians who in turn impacted the next. Carson --> Letterman ---> Conan who I grew up watching religiously.   I think the fragmentation of media will also play a part too. Television viewership has declined for various reasons, one of them being the internet. Even now you have people who are famous for youtube, vines, instagram, etc. Hard to reach as many eyeballs at one time like in the past and this trend will probably continue into the future."
koreanvariety,3bavxx,sportsteambfan,3,Sat Jun 27 17:13:19 2015 UTC,"my first thought was Park Myung Soo, Donnie, any of the current up and comers. However, I think they serve more purpose for their own humor, in the vein of Kang Ho Dong. As in they need to shine in a scene and rarely set other opportunities for others/guests to be funny. They are constantly the star of their own show.   The best person who sets up others in humor would be Haha. So I would do the unexpected and say Haha has probably the closest chance of becoming the next YJS. He doesn't have that image now BUT he has the capability. Different."

koreanvariety,3b7x49,InfamousMike,2,Fri Jun 26 21:32:47 2015 UTC,"Mers really isn't as serious as everyone claim it is. It's a fatal virus, but most fatality are those already sick so mers complicates their situation causing them to die. There is also no cure because it's a virus. It's in the same family as the flu. Flu has no cure either as it's a virus and it kills a couple hundreds of people a year.   There are some progress in finding the medicine that can strengthen you immune system so you will do fine against mers (like a flu shot) but that hasn't hit human trials yet. Thing of it as a less contagious but more deadly flu. The infection rate in Korea has also lowered to single digit rather than double digits since may. This is due to the quarantine placed on about 1300 people that may possibly came in contact with mers. So the officials are monitoring the progress pretty closely  Also I think the latest stats is 31 deaths and 20s recovered.  However, they used mers as a reason to delay this project because there's a chance, no matter how slim, of them infected without knowing when they travel along with production crew. And for sure they do not want to be known as the program to introduce mers to another country. That will end the show."

I actually really enjoy it. Also, when Haha returned they did a special on bedding him back into the variety world."
koreanvariety,3b7x49,Buragu,2,Sat Jun 27 08:51:15 2015 UTC,You haven't watch a lot of IC then. They dedicated 2 epsiodes for the Gil's pissing incident and in another episode all of them went to JunJin house to prank him with the alarms.
koreanvariety,3b7x49,deoxix,2,Sat Jun 27 16:24:13 2015 UTC,"Well, at least the 2 episodes of the accident were an over the top hilarious lawyer case (with testimonies, accusations, preparing defenses, a mock trial) for a really embarrassing thing that are for many (including me) two of the best episodes of IC. A well done concept that hasn't since been done better.   The Uee thing may be funny (i hope so) but i feel it has been really forced since his first official episode while uee doesn't seem to be interested in kwanghee at all (4º/6 place in attractiveness) because they feel the rush to find some kind of persona for him (and they should wait a lot longer for making it naturally) and that lingers the show pace.   I'm waiting more for the second part of the episode in which they will look for more single celebrity persons."

What I remember is they had to blend in naturally over time before they got their episodes, nor they had media play teams depending and praising Kwanghee for every single day.  And believe me, I dislike these futile efforts by both Taeho PD and his company to force him into the show more than his repetitive jokes and character."

koreanvariety,3b7x49,Hyperion98,4,Sat Jun 27 06:21:22 2015 UTC,If I recall correctly the WGM-inspired show with NHC and JYJ was actually received very well by audiences. The one that was problematic was when the IC members went looking for girls that NHC would date.  Netizens thought that it was stereotypical and stuff.
koreanvariety,3b7x49,themadbat,2,Sat Jun 27 08:50:00 2015 UTC,NHC is way more entertaining than Kwanghee though. He can carry his scenes on his own while Kwanghee usually needs a lot of hand-holding to make his scenes interesting. Jang Yoon Ju is also awesome in her appearances in IC.

All in all a better debut run than Gil and Jun Jin. Kudos to the cast for creating a character for him and making him feel comfortable.

CCTV is the station that had bought rights for the official Chinese version, and that has yet to be aired.  I had not watched it myself but I had heard reviews that while the first episode was alright, the subsequent episode was quite poor."
koreanvariety,3b9933,femacca,1 point,Sat Jun 27 14:07:49 2015 UTC,You sure? I feel this is more a version of Running man but they saw the IC chases and copied them.

koreanvariety,3b9933,femacca,2,Sat Jun 27 14:13:40 2015 UTC,"It's called 极限挑战 (Extreme Challenge) in Chinese, just only a word difference, and the all-male cast and concept are similar to IC. It has elements of Chinese RM and uses RM-esque music/sound efx to ride on their popularity. Anyway I heard there was a lot of heat between programme fans and Lay's fans since E2 because of Lay's behaviour. And some Chinese fans have said they'd rather wait and show support to the official Chinese version (because they took the effort to buy rights and work with Kim Taeho) rather than this 'blatant rip-off' to send a signal."
koreanvariety,3b9933,-Zephyr,2,Sat Jun 27 14:32:47 2015 UTC,"I don't know if they're going to do things like this every episode but talking about this one:   The first part is exactly the ""catch the tail"" chasing game from infinity challenge in a smaller playground (no taxis and so) with some element of having a limited time if they don't recharge it, but it's kind of useless because it's obvious no one was going to be out of the time before being catched. IIRC it was kind of the same IC did when they played this game the second time (the tv wars episode which was also a funny parody of tv channels competition for ratings) but the time mechanic was just to force them to pass through certain checkpoints (to cause meetings of the players and allow them to ambush one another).   When two players remained (not going to spoil) they go into two teams with the two players as captains and play another game (this one is original i think) in which there's numbered bases from 1 to 12 with keys to unlock them and they must be opened by numerical order (1-2-3...). The team that unlocks that base wins that same number of points and they go on until base 12 is unlocked. Then they count who has more points to make the winner. Also, the captains have assign part of their remaining time to their team members (he can do any time whenever he wants) but if one of his members run out of time he is completely out. The game is pretty interesting and have a kind of cool mechanics if you think about it. It may be a little unbalanced just to make final part important (if this was playing on real life you could allow the other team to get 1-8 while looking out for 9-12 that adds more points. Maybe they need a reevaluate what number should be. The idea of having mission on checkpoint kind of solves it) Edit: I was watching it quickly and i think i got it wrong, sorry. The game is just to get to 12 first, which is absolutely bullshit and makes going from 1-10 completely pointless, which is of course a classic unbalanced running man game. More than gaining minutes i think there's no benefit from winning a base. What a way to ruin what could be a perfectly good game.   I was mildly surprised by how the recording style and some of the music and sounds of the show are from Running man (there's one music piece everyone is going to get the first time they hear it) and how they're doing action stunts without any safety and then say this was doing with all the regulations for safety.   Anyways, i kind of liked it, it had some good and funny moments with a lot of the tropes of korean variety including the first 15 minutes of the show."

koreanvariety,3b6jh6,Oat-,1 point,Fri Jun 26 13:55:48 2015 UTC,I know right...  Still sad that they have to go...  I guess their backlog at the time of the break up is a factor other than the IRL factors
koreanvariety,3b6jh6,Isketam,2,Fri Jun 26 14:14:12 2015 UTC,Not many option right now when it comes to openly available English subs.  Either KSN for their speed sub + their inconsistency in the quality or DF for their average quality.   I missed iSubs and other hidden subs group too due to their additional translation note and the song name played in each episodes

What really bugs me about their subs though, is that they feel the need to Americanize even the most trivial things. When they replace terms that basically everyone who's ever watched a kdrama will know (Sunbae, Oppa, Noona) with inaccurate terms or with the person's name, I find myself losing interest."

koreanvariety,3b4jfc,CHOOMTOP,8,Sat Jun 27 04:41:12 2015 UTC,This season's cast has been so good together (in both chemistry and deduction) that it has somewhat ruined season one for me :(
koreanvariety,3b4jfc,syaaah8,3,Sat Jun 27 21:40:14 2015 UTC,"I watched season 2 before 1 and i totally get what you mean! Season 1 was messy in the beginning but they found a better structure for the show by the last few episodes (needing a detective who can't be the criminal, investigating in pairs, giving the roles to the cast beforehand, etc.)   I found that NS Yoonji was typecasted as the attractive woman with secret affairs while Hani was able to do a variety of characters. Dongmin is also less annoying than Hyun Moo hahaha. I love it when Hani laughs at his jokes."
koreanvariety,3b4jfc,CHOOMTOP,3,Sat Jun 27 22:07:57 2015 UTC,"yeah, when NS Yoonji came by she did pretty well too. I think season 2, the writers also did a better job and it allowed the cast to do more.  Dongmin is way better than Hyun Moo though"

There should be some kind of trust that people don't vote after revealing the criminal but i think it would be fun just to compare us vs. the tv viewers voting percentages.   Well, for the next season. Only just if the PD doesn't change the cast for foreigners and begin to record abroad cases of traumatic events of his childhood just to annoy his friends."
koreanvariety,3b4jfc,deoxix,6,Fri Jun 26 00:46:44 2015 UTC,It's always interesting when someone is heavily favoured right at the start of the case. There's no information to make an informed choice and yet someone has 50% or more. It's  crazy
koreanvariety,3b4jfc,no_more_space,4,Fri Jun 26 04:21:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah I think that statistic has to do with less people voting. Also, it's because there is little to no information in the beginning that one person's alibi/motive may seem more suspicious in the beginning."

koreanvariety,3b4jfc,sportsteambfan,-1,Mon Jun 29 01:25:42 2015 UTC,"Why do they keep saying that Jinho has a winning streak when he missed the criminal a couple of times.  Also why does that EXO guy have such a huge fanbase. Aren't most KPOP guys adored for their looks? But that guy looks just like an average person with tons of makeup. Even the assistant guy is more handsome than him. As for his performance as a guest, there was nothing special about it."
koreanvariety,3b4jfc,elementard123,3,Mon Jun 29 09:24:09 2015 UTC,The Jinho winning streak thing is obviously made up.  I'm pretty sure they mentioned at the beginning to not take anything in this murder case seriously. Everything other than their names and professions are fictitious.

koreanvariety,3b26fq,blarrrgo,14,Thu Jun 25 10:55:31 2015 UTC,"I'd give it a try from the point where the cases stopped being 2 episodes and instead were just one episode. Pacing improved a lot (atleast for me). I think they started doing it like that from episode 7, but I'm not quite sure."
koreanvariety,3b26fq,stijnx,8,Thu Jun 25 10:59:09 2015 UTC,"Seconding /u/stijnx's opinion to watch the one-episode cases, since they're a lot faster paced. Out of those later episodes, 7 is my favourite--it's a really clever case, with interesting characters and some nice twists. 9 & 10 are also good, but a little gorier. Out of the two-episode cases, the school murder in ep. 3-4 is my favourite.   I found Crime Scene 2 to be even better than the original season though. The cast is better at solving mysteries, but the members also click better with each other and are way funnier. There are some really standout guests in season 2 as well. Ep 0/1 is skippable, unless you'd like an intro to the characters and format, but most of the cases this season are really wonderful. If you end up liking the cast, I'd personally watch it all the way through. :) Any episode with Kim Ji-hoon (2, 3, 11) is absolutely amazing. The two cruise murders (7&8) were also really interesting."

koreanvariety,3b26fq,kpop_closet,5,Thu Jun 25 15:49:10 2015 UTC,"I would recommend you to watch season 2 instead, where things were more fast-paced and I'm sure it'll capture your attention much quicker.   Try episode 4, the Beauty Pageant murder case.   PS: I would suggest you to watch in chronological order though, because they actually make a lot of references to previous episodes (which some of them might be spoilers). It's not exactly that important, but it'll be preferred especially in season 2 if you do not want to miss anything out!   Happy watching."
koreanvariety,3b26fq,Delfish,4,Thu Jun 25 16:23:56 2015 UTC,"Episodes without Henry lol but seriously start from the episode where they changed the format from 2 episodes per case to 1 episode only, CS got better and easier to watch."
koreanvariety,3b26fq,Bananauyu,2,Thu Jun 25 17:03:07 2015 UTC,"my favorites from season 1 and 2 :   school murder (3&4, season 1), jail murder (7, season 1), actress murder (10, season 1)  beauty pageant case (4, season 2), cruise ship murder (7&8, season 2), PD murder case (11, season 2) ---> the numbering is NOT according to how Korean numbers the episodes, introductory episode counts as ep 1  but as stated by /u/Delfish before, for season 2 it's better to watch chronologically to get inside jokes that can enhance your viewing experience"
koreanvariety,3b26fq,natcookie,1 point,Fri Jun 26 03:35:54 2015 UTC,"Start from Season 1 episode 1, the whole show is just pure awesome.  As someone else already mentioned, it gets better when they have one case per episode, but seriously, watch it all. It is worth it."

koreanvariety,3b294c,FiveDiamondGame,7,Thu Jun 25 11:32:37 2015 UTC,SGB was such a fun show. It was a good time in variety shows.
koreanvariety,3b294c,ChikNoods,9,Thu Jun 25 13:41:45 2015 UTC,"Since I can't speak Korean, one of my favorite elements of the show was hearing the proverbs that made absolutely no sense to me whatsoever, and having everyone on the stage just agree, like, ""Oh yes, once the dog meets the cow, the moon will set at dawn."" Korean proverbs translated to English are fantastic. We don't have any cool ones."

koreanvariety,3b294c,kpopper2013,2,Fri Jun 26 22:23:21 2015 UTC,"It wasn't a renewal show. It was a Lunar New Year special, one time deal. There was no plan for it to continue on a regular basis.  I also love SGB and hoped for a return. Sadly, it doesn't look like it will be anytime soon."
koreanvariety,3b294c,femacca,2,Thu Jun 25 11:38:18 2015 UTC,I certainly miss the show too. Ji Suk Jin was at his hosting best then.
koreanvariety,3b294c,SarcasticSarcophagus,1 point,Thu Jun 25 23:45:23 2015 UTC,"I honestly doubt there will be a return. Most variety shows end because there's not enough people watching them, unlike dramas where they plan to end it. The reason why SGB stopped was because of lack of viewership, not because the necessarily wanted it to end.  The Chuseok special was a one-time deal because there were enough people to justify making the special, but not enough to justify making a return."
koreanvariety,3b294c,rsxstock,2,Thu Jun 25 19:22:13 2015 UTC,probably because of the high casting fees too. 20 guests each time
koreanvariety,3ayhmd,franklin_donuts,15,Wed Jun 24 14:54:57 2015 UTC,IC  Yoo Jae Suk 10/10  Park Myung Soo 10/10  Jung Jun ha 10/10  Jung Hyung Don 10/10  Noh Hong Chul 10/10  Haha 10/10  above 6 are the perfect casting. they all can carry on their own and are very capable of adding adlibs to eachother's jokes. not to mention they all share a 10 year bond together so there's not even an ounce of awkwardness when they're together. it all comes off very naturally  Jun Jin 7/10: it's been a while since i last rewatched an episode with him but afaik he wasn't very outstanding  Gil 7.5/10: it was very awkward to watch gil try to be funny most of the time and it was obvious the members had to adlib his jokes 24/7. however he's been with the members the most out of the three and personally i grew to be quite fond of him.   Kwang Hee 6.5/10: still relatively new but so far he hasn't left a very good impression on me yet  1N2D  Kim Jong Min 9.5/10  Kim Jun Ho 9.5/10  Cha Tae Hyun 9.5/10  above 3 are excellent choices. kjm and kjh is one of the best duos ever and they aren't even a forced one by the PD  Kim Joo Hyuk 8/10  Jung Joon Young 8/10  Defconn 8/10  i was a bit skeptical about these 3 at first but i became quite fond of them because of how quickly they bonded together with the rest of the cast
koreanvariety,3ayhmd,lupin88,5,Wed Jun 24 18:44:35 2015 UTC,"It actually got pretty funny how unfunny Gil was. Kinda miss him (not as much as Hongchul tho). Overall, your ratings are closest to mine!"
koreanvariety,3ayhmd,stijnx,2,Wed Jun 24 22:38:11 2015 UTC,agree with your opinion. kjm and kjh is the best duo
koreanvariety,3ayhmd,kyoza,2,Fri Jun 26 02:54:56 2015 UTC,"Not all of them shared 10 years together in IC. Only NHC, YJS and JHD did."
koreanvariety,3ayhmd,RaginReap,2,Fri Jun 26 09:40:52 2015 UTC,i'm aware! but the other 3 are only off by about a year or less so i just included them. plus i'm sure most of them knew eachother prior to the show!
koreanvariety,3ayhmd,lupin88,8,Fri Jun 26 10:02:19 2015 UTC,"For me it used to be 1. IC 2. RM 3. 1N2D but lately it has been 1. 1N2D 2. IC 3. RM ...  Happy that everyone seems to think Ji Suk Jin is highly rated. I feel so too. His jokes never gets old and he is just a great tv personality. Anyway will just talk about IC and 1N2D since they are less talked about here...  IC  Yoo Jae Suk - 10/10...God Yoo. Yoo Jae Suk is already comfortable with the IC gang and he really gives his 101% to the show. I have to say, with the new intro of Kwang Hee, I do see him having to do more work to make sure he fits in properly. During the India trip, he had to take care of Kwang Hee which I dunno...I kinda wished his life was easier...but anyway, he is the best MC ever.   HaHa - 7/10 ...I felt, since RM started, Haha had more a presence in RM than IC...especially since he was overshadowed by Noh Hong Chul during that time when he first finished his national service. Even now, with NHC gone, Haha is like trying to take on NHC's cunning character, which is like...a big no no. He's funny as Yoo Jaesuk's fave ""sidekick"" though.  Junha 8.5/10...Junha has become a better and funnier member recently. I think it's because of the Ha and Soo gags.   Hyungdon 7 /10...Hyungdon is in a slump in IC...although I do see him do well in other shows, but he's in a slump for IC.   Myungsoo 10/10 ...Myungsoo is a moody man, and how good he does depends alot on his emotional state. I think he is in a good place right now, emotionally...he has his music and he is more stable compared to a few years back. He is a funny man and gifted in comedy.   Kwanghee ...4/10 I really thought he would be better than Junjin...but in the episodes I see him in...I still don't know...I mean, he is still new, so he may get better. Hope so!  1N2D Cha Taehyun 10/10 My fave man. He is just so likable. He can just stand there and laugh and still be so cute.   Kim Jongmin 10/10 He is hilarious lately. Especially when you put him with Junho. He really plays the brat of the team and I love it when he teases Joohyuk about being old and follows with his evil laughter. We didn't see his evil side in the previous seasons, and it's really funny.   Kim Junho 10/10...He is my fave member of the cast. He is also like Myungsoo...a natural comedian. But he also wears his heart on his sleeve which is what makes him so awesome.   Joohyuk 6/10...he's okie as the big bro of the group...but I don't really see him do anything beside get excited over girls. haha.   Jongyoung 7/10 ..a very strange maknae. But his strange personality is great for tv.   Defconn..7/10 more of a glue of the group. Helps bring everyone together."
koreanvariety,3ayhmd,dreamraine,12,Thu Jun 25 05:26:50 2015 UTC,"I've been on a Crime Scene/The Genius kick lately, where character/individual performance isn't as important. (I will say that Hong Jin-ho is surprisingly a total natural in front of the camera though.) So I'll just do RM since that's the one I'm most familiar with. From best to worst:  Yoo Jae-Suk - 9.5/10. Obviously, he's the core of the show. He's the leader both in terms of the entertainment business but also the cast more personally, as a team. He's consistent, he's good as a team leader but also as a supporting member when other members have their turn in the spotlight. Amazing with guests. He makes being an entertainer look absolutely effortless. I did dock 0.5 because I feel that his character is basically the same across every show he does, and because he has a tendency to go over the top at times.   Haha - 9/10. Honestly one of the most underrated members. He had a period of awkward transition when he got married, where he relied on over-acting and lame gimmicks, but he's done a really good job since. It's always YJS/LKS/even KJK who get the spotlight, but Haha is nearly as well-rounded and skilled as Jae-suk. He's amazing with guests, and transitions between more active and more supporting roles effortlessly. He's proven that he can step up as a leader when he needs to-- one of the defining RM moments for me was when Haha captained his cardboard ship across the Han River to victory. What makes his variety presence even more impressive is that the members have commented many times that his real personality is actually very withdrawn and quiet--so his character requires that much more effort and commitment when the cameras are rolling. He's also matured a lot as both a character and a person over the past few years. His relationships with the other members are some of the best.  Lee Kwang-soo - 8.5/10. Definitely the cast member who's grown the most over the past five years. He was SO AWKWARD and so quiet at first (this is probably an unpopular opinion, but in the first few months of RM, Joong-ki was better), but he's transitioned beautifully into a funny yet down-to-earth variety star. While some parts of his shtick do get old at times (his constant sabotaging of Jong-kook, mostly), he's hilarious with just about every other member, and can make basically anything funny.   Ji Suk-jin - 8.5/10. Honestly, JSJ is another criminally underrated member. Sure, he's useless at the physical stuff, but part of that is him playing up his character. He has great relationships with the other members, and in interviews the others always comment about how Suk-jin has the most laid-back and nicest personality out of all of them-- as the oldest hyung, he could be really demanding and mean off-camera. So I think while YJS is the clear leader/centre of the show, JSJ gets a lot of credit for the close-knit relationships the members maintain off-camera as well. He's also so, so witty. His improvisation skills are pro, and he always amazes me and makes even the other members laugh at how effortlessly he composes little songs and raps-- heck, he even freestyled against Gary a few weeks ago, and in the most recent episode, he out-dissed the hip hop artists.   Kim Jong-Kook - 8/10. His character really hasn't changed much over the course of RM, but he gets points for being the games king and best brawler of the show. He sort of needs other members around to be funny, but he's a definite leader and a good sport.   Song Ji-hyo - 7/10. She's surprisingly shy, which means that she does a lot better in episodes where she has cast members or familiar guests to interact with, because she can show more of her competitive spirit and aggression. She's a quick thinker and a fierce player though, which makes her good at the games aspect just like KJK. She's gotten a lot funnier/more natural at variety over the years, but her performance is probably the most inconsistent out of the entire cast-- give her a role, a clever race, or a partner she feels comfortable bantering with (especially LKS and Haha, those pairings are absolute comedic gold) and she'll be REALLY good; on the other hand, in an episode where there's a lot of free talk or there's an emphasis on female guests, she all but disappears. Nevertheless, I do have a soft spot for Ji-hyo because I think she's funnier and more endearing than some RM fans give her credit for.  Gary - 5.5/10. Man, I want to love him more. But I was never a Monday Couple fan (give me SpartAce, Song Song siblings, Kwang/Mong, Yoo/Mong, Ha/Mong, literally any other pairing is funnier than this one). Over the years he hasn't developed much as a character. He's not a leader. He's good at games sometimes but others do it better-- Gary's ability is solely physical, while KJK and SJK have clever and sneaky plots to complement their other skills. Also wildly inconsistent-- in some pairings, he's fantastic. Throw him together with Haha and Kwang-soo, for example, and shenanigans will ensue. But the rest of the time he just seems to be trying too hard. The others have talked before about how Gary is such a witty guy off-camera, but it just doesn't necessarily translate in front of cameras."
koreanvariety,3ayhmd,concreteroads,3,Wed Jun 24 17:10:04 2015 UTC,"Excellent post. Love that you covered the off-camera stuff, and I pretty much agree w/ everything.  What sticks out to me is your point about Suk-jin. He truly is underrated, I feel, and his strongest points aren't being utilized at their fullest in RM. After 5 years, it really sticks out how much better he is at ad-libbing and verbal humor than most of the cast bar Jae-suk. Doesn't hurt that he can turn his weakness into some excellent slapstick.  I feel like he'd do wonders in a more natural and interaction-focused variety. Something like Dad, Where Are You Going?, 3 Meals a Day, or maybe even 1N2D. At the very least, though, he's making bank w/ RM."
koreanvariety,3ayhmd,sfoura,7,Wed Jun 24 17:52:04 2015 UTC,"Running Man:  Yoo Jae Suk 10/10: Here's the thing. With most other MCs, RM may not have lasted as long as it did. If you watch the earlier episodes, you can see how weak half of the cast was with variety. Not only that, an outdoors athletic competition requires a lot more effort to be funny because the gags aren't as controllable. This is where YJS steps in. Of course, he's going to knock it out of the park at the talk segments with his wit but I think fans underrate how difficult it is to think of clever ways to interfere, to nag, to poke fun while physical games happen. That's where variety veterans shine and no one is better than YJS with it. The backbone of the show ofc.  Lee Kwang Soo 8.5/10: Has improved in all aspects from the beginning. He's legitimately funny and often is the life of segments. My one issue is that he still doesn't quite get how to balance his sthick with the flow of the game. Sometimes, these games would benefit from an entertainment aspect if he doesn't do his interfering (YJS knows how to do it without making it too much). There are times where, instead of laughing at his antics, I get annoyed or cringe because he interrupted something I legit was enjoying. He's gotta pick his spots better.   Haha 8.5/10: It's hard to appreciate Haha's role....unless you watch Infinite Challenge and see him do the same. Then, you start to appreciate what he does. His role is the support. He throws in barbs when he needs to but he is the best at being the utility man of the group. When he needs to lead, he leads. When he needs to be the guy for YJS/KJK/LKS/JSJ to play off of, he does that well. He did bumble when he lost his character due to getting married but he adjusted and has fit in nicely.  Kim Jong Kook 8/10: Gets high points for being the physical maestro of the group. This is a physical game and not only is KJK strong, he's coordinated and clever. You can't outsmart him either and that's what makes him so dangerous. He has also gotten MUCH better with his banter with YJS but he needs someone to play off of. He loses a little because he disappears at times during name tag games (i think one of his strategies is to hide and pick off people but there are episodes where he doesnt show up due to this).  Ji Suk Jin: 9/10: Not only the most underrated (and critical) members of the cast, but possibly one of the most underrated variety veterans on Korean TV. People forget this guy has years of experience even before RM, was a MC of many shows and has been around for at least 20 years. What he lacks in physical skill, he more than makes up with by being 1. incredibly funny (the funniest member of the cast besides YJS and that includes Kwangsoo) and 2. really witty/sharp. Plus, you can tell the cast adores him and that's important in these long lasting shows.  Gary 7.5/10: I think Gary has suffered the most from losing his main Monday Couple character because, for a long time, that's all he did. Song Ji Hyo has many other attributes (blank face, the ace, etc) but Gary's main trait was his infatuation with Ji Hyo and he just seems to be floundering without it. There are times when he completely shines (usually in name-tag pulling when he's almost as good as KJK) but any sort of variety is where he suffers.  Song Ji Hyo 7.5/10: To me, Song Ji Hyo is a casuality of the format and how RM PDs work rather than her abilities. She has shown that she is, in fact, very witty and clever. She can trade back with YJS/KJK and her characters (Angry Ji Hyo, Mong Ji Hyo, RM's Ace) really haven't gotten stale yet. The problem is 1. she gets completely and utterly overshadowed by female guests because she steps aside and lets the guests shine 2. RM has wayyyyyyyyyyy too many couple games when the cast is obviously matched with female (or even male) counterparts and Ji Hyo is either stuck with Gary or she is the MC. That's more the case of how terrible the coupling format is at this point. She still has the most potential and can shine but I do wonder if the format of the show is what holds her back at this point."
koreanvariety,3ayhmd,concreteroads,1 point,Wed Jun 24 18:53:02 2015 UTC,"Excellent assessment :) It's awesome to see Suk-jin finally getting some love in this thread.   I agree that some members are casualties of the show format. Suk-jin being one of them, plus Ji-hyo like you said. I was really pleased in recent episodes when the producers finally started experimenting with new things after so many years-- it was awesome seeing Kwang/Mong and Haroro & Ji-hyo paired together, and getting more funny moments and screen time. Same with the recent increase in Suk-jin funnies. I think of the two ex-MC members, SJH has somewhat more potential than Gary, because she has additional roles like you mentioned."
koreanvariety,3ayhmd,sfoura,4,Wed Jun 24 19:30:56 2015 UTC,I think the show is basically in the situation it's in because of the format. It's interesting to see the cast rated so high across the board and then think that cast interaction/characters are what needs to be changed. No. The format needs to be tweaked to better utilize the strengths of the members (it cant be changed).
koreanvariety,3ayhmd,kyopda,2,Thu Jun 25 02:39:04 2015 UTC,"One thing I find repetitive is how the staff chooses the teams and pairings instead of letting the members do that on their own. It's nearly the same and we get the idea. JSJ must be paired with LKS/YJS, Gary must be paired with attractive women guests or SJH to show him blushing, SJH is rarely paired with guests, YJS, HaHa or KJK. It had been like that since they began this minigame format 4 years ago and it limits the cast interactions and diversity. They need to give more control to the members or try to completely randomize the teams. That should give the members more freedom and chances to develop something new which is very needed right now.  Basically, they need to take risks and try new things instead of being satisfied where they are because they feel invulnerable with international popularity."
koreanvariety,3ayhmd,Delfish,1 point,Thu Jun 25 05:23:16 2015 UTC,"I agree with this so much. It's really time they have fresh cast pairings. YJS-LKS, Monday Couple, YJS-KJK bickering can get quite stale.  To shake things up, I would like to see more of these pairings.   Gary-LKS Haha-SJH (They were paired up in one of the recent episodes and their interactions were surprisingly on point, way better than MC tbh) LKS-SJH (Another man Jihyo has great chemistry with) KJK and the two kids (This was so overdone in the early episodes, but then it just completely died out)"
koreanvariety,3ayhmd,onelifetolive1,1 point,Thu Jun 25 16:48:40 2015 UTC,gary and lks i've never seen interact together now that i think about it.  Haha and SJH would be a much better pair imo than SJH and Gary but Haha could survive without the coupling and Gary couldn't
koreanvariety,3ayhmd,vaynev,1 point,Sat Jun 27 21:54:54 2015 UTC,"I think the only interactions I have seen between Gary and LKS were in 248. Other than that, I cannot remember an episode where they spent any noticeable length of time speaking or interacting whatsoever."
koreanvariety,3ayhmd,concreteroads,2,Mon Jun 29 21:07:59 2015 UTC,"Fully agreed. It makes me frustrated when I see RM watchers picking and choosing their favourites, and then declaring that the rest of the show needs a member change.   I don't think that's true at all. The cast is amazing. I have watched every single episode, 252 over 5 years--usually multiple times--not because I like to see them running around and playing ridiculous games (although that can also be fun), but because I think the dynamic that the cast has built over the past five years is something truly special. The producers could put them in a room for 90 minutes and I'd probably watch the raw footage, because everyone clicks. The characters and cast interaction, when we get it without those interactions needing to be forced, is awesome. I completely agree that it's the format and structure of the games that needs tweaking. I think the show has been on an upswing recently with a lot of experimentation, but then episodes like the hip hop one leave me wondering what the heck the current producers are thinking."
koreanvariety,3ayhmd,sfoura,4,Thu Jun 25 02:49:37 2015 UTC,"Ugh. The hip hop episode exposed everything that is wrong with Running Man right now. You have interesting guests (one of which is a budding variety superstar who is funny and engaging in every single show she's on) and you turn it into 3 basic minigames with a math-related final boss game and a terrible background concept.   I mean what?!   What is the reasoning for that?? It's a hip hop special but it's set place in a school?? You don't even make one of the games ""freestyle"" which would actually play off of the guests's traits?? You don't include a nametag race when you have 5 males and Jessi who openly says that she wants to do nametag games (and would destroy tbh)??? Granted, the final game was actually intense but it's all so silly.  I am not into this ""1N2D"" slow popularity growth like others are. I still think that RM has a much stronger cast as a whole and the top 4 on RM can match up with any variety show not named Infinity Challenge. However, 1N2D does know how to play to the strength of its guests and cast. That's the one thing that sets that show apart. It's not going to make a difference internationally but it's why RM has the low ratings it does and perhaps RM's PDs need to start playing to the strengths of the cast and its guests in order to improve the show domestically.  I have no hope for next week as it appears to be another boring couple race concept (mind you, I'll be watching for Yeeun from CLC and Irene Kim) but I hope the SNSD episode represents a change of some sort."
koreanvariety,3ayhmd,concreteroads,1 point,Thu Jun 25 03:19:00 2015 UTC,"I think the difficulty RM faces in ratings is that it caters a lot to the international audience, as well as a younger audience-- all of whom watch the show online rather than in person with their families every Sunday night. So I do think the popularity for RM is way higher than the ratings can ever indicate.  That said, I agree, the hip hop episode was pretty bad. Like I said, some of the recent episodes have been awesome (the punishment episode; the second half of the jajangmyun episode; kwang soo day, etc). But the hip hop episode just defeated everything they've been trying to improve this year. I had the same complaints as you-- you have hip hop stars on for crying out loud. Make them do a diss battle! Some kind of physical race! Anything! The one thing I loved about the episode was that they managed to turn every single game into a full out brawl, lmao. So if they were gonna do that anyways to try to make up for an awful game, why not just throw a nametag ripping race in there to begin with? The guests are young, athletic, and sneaky-- they could've easily had an awesome race. What a total waste of Jessi, and of Eun Ji Won, who is absolutely awesome in variety (and could totally outsmart all the others in a well-designed race game like in the old RM days).   I commend 1N2D for pulling itself out of its Season 2 slump, but you're right. I'm not attached to the cast. They could change around the entire cast again and I wouldn't particularly care. The format is more forgiving for guests--suffering makes for good airtime. I think RM has been a little lax lately in that front.   The SNSD episode doesn't look that good from the shots of the weird giant boards they have set up. :c But I'll stay optimistic. The preview for this weekend's episode actually looked good though! RM has done couple concept well in the past-- once they stopped relying on old tricks like MC and brought in new dynamics like HahaxJihyo or KwangxMong."
koreanvariety,3ayhmd,sfoura,2,Thu Jun 25 03:27:24 2015 UTC,"Their international audience pretty much ensures that they won't get cancelled for a while. They are too popular but I am sure SBS is making some ""suggestive"" phone calls to improve ratings.  I have hope about the SNSD episode simply due to the fact that it's a two-parter. Get the silly games out of the way for one episode and then do something new for the second.  Couple races annoy me because the cast goes into ""never seen a female before, cater to them, lovey-dovey"" mode which is a personal pet peeve of mine and the forced lovelines drive me nuts. I have had my fill of Kwangsoo/Gary acting like morons when they see a pretty female."
koreanvariety,3ayhmd,concreteroads,1 point,Thu Jun 25 03:56:48 2015 UTC,"Oh, I didn't realize the SNSD episode was a two-parter. I do have a bit more faith in it then, although I've already expressed my doubt about the apparent teams in a different thread. SNSD is decent at variety, so here's hoping they can do something interesting!  The bending over backwards catering to female guests really works in some cases-- I remember ep 100, where the A list actress who came in totally rolled with it and made jokes about her beauty. It's boring when the idol guests just accept all the fawning compliments and such. Kwang-soo just generally acts like a moron lol. I'm used to it, because he's adorable and his lovelines are actually funny. I think Gary will be more love line hungry now that MC is definitively over... the way he was when MC was paused for a while."
koreanvariety,3ayhmd,sfoura,2,Thu Jun 25 04:06:14 2015 UTC,"It has to be the right guest and it rarely is. Perhaps I just hate the fakeness of the interactions. What makes RM so great for me is that, even though the show has its scripted elements, the show feels real as the outcomes are really hard to fix with finishes that even the Pds didn't expect. The lovelines, however, are obviously so fake that it takes me out of that realism.  That's what I think RM could learn from more realistic shows like Cool Kids on the Block: treating guests and cast equally."
koreanvariety,3ayhmd,usus789,6,Thu Jun 25 04:10:19 2015 UTC,"Glad to see Ji Suk Jin getting recognition in this topic. Most RM fans think of him as mostly useless in running man games, but I personally think he's the third funniest member after Jae Suk and Kwang Soo..."
koreanvariety,3ayhmd,kyopda,6,Wed Jun 24 18:47:32 2015 UTC,"RM  YJS: 10/10-Without him, there's no show. Compared to IC, he's more laid out and fun loving side.  KJK: 10/10-I can't believe how much he changed from his shy and loveline dependent days from X-Man to an experienced variety veteran who can be in charge of leading guests and responsibilities by himself. KJK mentioned RM was the first variety he was determined to take control of himself and improve, and it shows.  JSJ: 9/10-He's really underappreciated. But you have to remember he was the MC of some of the most popular shows like Six Heroines which was KBS's main eye catcher before 1N2D. Despite action shows are not actually his area of strength and he wasn't interested to show much efforts in the beginning, he does his best now and wins the most improved award if there is one. If you pay attention on what's going on at background, you will often find him helping other members.  HH: 7/10-He's good as what he is brought for: a support like he does at IC. He's not good at games and had been in slump recently though. He needs to create a new gimmick/character soon. One of the few members whom the staff trusts in taking care of the guests.  SJH: 6/10-While JSJ wins the most improved award, SJH gets the least. She really was the ace and the main attraction of the show before she got into her scandal, but she's now a shadow of herself who depends on chivalry from the other members and luck. It's really sad because I know she has the potential than just standing at background most of the time, but the format and games nowadays are not the ones she can show her powers on. She needs to step up and prove how she's the ace like the staff always tries to claim on captions. But she's still the icon of the show and I doubt any other women entertainer can replace that or impress more than how she did at old days.  Gary: 6/10-Like SJH, he's another of those forgotten members recently. I miss the times he came up with catchphrases and creative comments, and broke everyone's expectations by sometimes outperforming himself.  LKS: 8/10-He's doing all right, although not much as 2012 when I considered him as the prime of his time. One thing about him is he's not afraid to fight dirty, and will give everything to the show. However, that's both his greatest strength and weakness, and he needs to control it. He's still remembered mostly as pitiful and unlucky guy he was at the beginning and people's sympathy of his original persona is how he got his popularity at the first place. He needs to be careful not to break that image with some of his overdoing and come up with a different character than giraffe which is getting old.  But generally, most of the RM characters have been stale for 3 years, and the same old format and guest centric episodes most of the time aren't helping much with character developments and interaction between members. The show needs to worry less about the guests and more about their own.  IC  YJS: 10/10-Same as his role at RM. Compared to RM, he's more serious and responsible side.  HH: 8/10-I really miss his interaction with Hong-Chul.  JJH: 7/10-He's usually at the receiving side of the attacks from the members and can do that ""punching bag"" character really well. That makes him some of the most unique variety persona from Korean shows.  JHD: 7/10-Despite his successes at Weekly Idol, I am surprised that he is more on the quiet side on the show. However, some of the gags and character interactions can't be done without him. He's like someone you may not notice much when he's there, but you are going to miss him a lot when he's gone.  PMS: 9/10-He's really ambitious on getting his screen times, and although he makes mistakes of not understanding the rules, he's still a good game player and never gives up. But probably that's why he doesn't excel when he at the center of the attention. Unlike the other members who usually hesitate when they are at the spotlight, he tends to go over the limits and get excited too much. However, his ""evil"" personality makes a perfect contrast with YJS's, and without that both YJS and the show wouldn't have prospered. Just look at how many nicknames they created for him since the show began. Those are the very representation of the show's history.  Kwanghee: 1/10-Sorry Kwanghee fans, but I opposed him from the very beginning from Sixth Man because of the following reason: He can't come up with any new ideas than his plastic jokes which only he finds funny, comparing himself to Siwan/Hyungsik, or mentioning UEE. I saw him doing that on every shows since his first appearances at Jungle and WGM years ago and expected him to do the same at IC. And my guesses came out to be exactly right. I still can't believe how they limited themselves into choosing him despite idols never match the original purpose nor the color of the show. Also, he brought many media plays and unwanted interference from his company and other certain groups. I dislike those media plays and the show trying to center around him recently even more than his performance at IC. He is nowhere talented as Hong-Chul to take burdens off from YJS which is his supposed responsibility according to the PD, but instead he is adding more to the other members. His honeymoon period is definitely over, and people missing Gil shows that."
koreanvariety,3ayhmd,gr1zzlybear,5,Wed Jun 24 21:15:07 2015 UTC,"I haven't really watched any IC, so I can only offer my opinions on RM and 1N2D.  RM:  Yoo Jae-suk 10/10 - Nuff said. You lose him, might as well lose the whole show.  Lee Kwang-soo 9/10 - Asia's Prince. Probably had the most growth in the show, from scenestealer to now taking the lead in most episodes.  Haha 8/10 - Probably the best support on the show, has good banter w/ every other cast member and makes guest feel comfortable. Also transitioned his character pretty well after getting married.  Kim Jong-kook 8/10 - Irreplaceable because what he brings is so important to the show: physicality. Far from FO's Kim Kook Jong, his veteran experience now also makes him solid in the variety aspect.  Ji Suk-jin 7/10 - While being the weakest competitor on the show, I put him solidly top 3 variety-wise. He can do both wit and slapstick, and is responsible for many of the funniest moments on the show.  Gary 6/10 - Very inconsistent, still capable of producing great performances and highlights w/ whoever his partner is, but tends to disappear a lot nowadays for most episodes.  Song Ji-Hyo 6/10 - While one of the best at games and her competitiveness suits the show, outside of MC and her banter w/ the cast, she's still limited variety-wise and tends to get cut, but has improved over 5 years.     1N2D S3:  Cha Tae-hyun 9/10 - unofficial leader of 1N2D. Most consistent member, and the best reactions. Losing his ""I'm ruined"" image from S2 was actually beneficial, as he doesn't seem to rely on anything but his personality anymore.  Kim Jun-ho 8/10 - Of course, funniest guy on the show. Just like Jong Kook (and Sugeun in S2), is probably the most irreplaceable member because no else can replicate his gag know-how most episodes.  Kim Jong-min 8/10 - Petitions to kick him out in S1, was awkward and didn't fit w/ the others in S2, Jongmin finally looks relaxed and settled, and has formed a great tandem w/ Junho.   Kim Joo-hyuk 7/10 - Seamless fit right from the start. Very self-deprecating w/ a very understated sense of humor, he also shows a lot of heart during some of the more touching and emotional parts of the show.  Jung Joon-young 7/10 - The worst maknae this show has ever seen, and somehow that is a positive. Very weird and unpredictable, he does tend to disappear because he doesn't talk much.  Defconn 7/10 - Gets a lot of flak for being annoying, but I personally like him because he shows a lot of passion about and is genuinely appreciative of being on the show. He has also proven to be the best at interacting w/ the public/non-celebrities, which imo is very, very important on this show."
koreanvariety,3ayhmd,ZoddGutts,7,Wed Jun 24 16:21:44 2015 UTC,"Completely agree with Cha Tae-Hyun, he definitely is like the leader. It's kind of awesome to see him interacting with the cast so well even though he is introverted, he just works so well with all the cast. Junho is just hilarious. Did you see the Reunification special when he read his letter? I was dying for 5 minutes.   Joohyuk seems to have taken the Kim C role but imo it's an upgrade because, like you said, he has very good comedic timing and at the same time he his very self deprecating. I think Defconn may be a little annoying but he's a really good person and I personally don't find him really annoying.   I think the RM cast as a whole are the definition of relying on one-note/one gimmick and that's why it's getting stale. Honestly I don't find RM fun to watch anymore when 3MAD/1N2D/LOTJ follow a much more natural, organic variety experience which is more fun to watch imo"
koreanvariety,3ayhmd,gr1zzlybear,-1,Wed Jun 24 16:55:42 2015 UTC,"I found Junho annoying in The Human Condition, and I feel that if it was any other show other than 1N2D/Gag Concert, I'd still find him annoying. But he is absolutely a perfect fit on this show. Idk why that is, but it just works.  And yeah, Joohyuk has that Kim C dry charm w/ a dash of Kim Seung-woo mat-hyung madness.  Agree w/ your last point. RM was my first variety, but after TvN started airing in my country right around the first airing of Grandpas over Flowers, I've definitely preferred varieties where a bit of personality shine through pre-made variety characters. That's why one of my favorite episodes of RM was when Lee Seo-jin was the guest, heh."
koreanvariety,3ayhmd,natcookie,2,Wed Jun 24 18:11:55 2015 UTC,"Juhn Ho on Human Condition was everyone's boss literally, so he was able to boss everyone around, but on 1N2D he can't do that."
koreanvariety,3ayhmd,TaeTaeyeon,0,Wed Jun 24 23:19:19 2015 UTC,I remember a lot of Running Man fans + people on reddit really disliked that episode because they thought LSJ was super rude and a bad guest.
koreanvariety,3ayhmd,leesam,3,Wed Jun 24 19:06:22 2015 UTC,"LOL on JJY being the worst maknae.   as for me personally, i don't mind him being like that, it's like a breath of fresh air. perhaps it's cultural difference factor too.  junho-jongmin is one of the funniest duo i've ever seen on k-variety shows. even i'm new on 1N2D, i can tell that jongmin looks relaxed and happy on season 3 (he stated this himself too on highlight episode). for this reason too, i'm still a bit hesitated to watch season 1 and 2---mainly 2---because i can't imagine watching this show with jongmin being less relaxed than he is in season 3."
koreanvariety,3ayhmd,polidarida,5,Wed Jun 24 23:31:25 2015 UTC,"I would just generally say the RM cast is about optimal. The core 5 for me is SukJin, Jae Suk, KJK, Kwangsoo, and Haha. They each play distinctly different roles and fit in in any context and can ad-lib in any situation.  I will say I think they could use a member shake up, whether it be replacements or just additions.  Gary has had his moments, but I think he's the odd man out, chemistry wise. He's funny in a way that's too subtle for a fast paced show like RM. Depending on the situation he can be great, but man if there is a poorly planned segment, he can't save it like the other 5 guys can.  Ji Hyo I think has also exhausted her run. Her greatest trait is honesty and being unafraid of getting down and dirty, however I'd say that since 2010 when the show debuted, there have been a lot of girls who were willing to do what she did and provided more on the banter back and forth end, making me think perhaps a better replacement for her could be found..  I love Gary and JiHyo but I love this show more than each of them individually, and I would hate it if they were replaced but I would also be secretly relieved.  I was thinking RM could go younger than Gary and find someone to replace the 'old Kwangsoo', someone to be the Maknae for the rest of the RM to pick on; Kwangsoo left that role behind many years ago but it was a good role! That would breathe a lot of new life into the show.  For Ji Hyo, I would love if someone like Lee Yoo Ri came in to replace Ji Hyo, personality wise and competition wise (she was the one who appeared in the drama girls episode, the one who busted her ass in waterlogged jeans). I think somebody like her could provide more consistent energy and be more naturally talkative..naturally, being the only girl on the show, whatever girl it is has to be that much more charismatic and badass to represent."
koreanvariety,3ayhmd,ImKindOfBlind,3,Wed Jun 24 20:11:40 2015 UTC,I watch RM and IC :   RM : (1.) Yoo Jae-suk : 10/10 (2.) Kwangsoo : 9.5/10 (3.) Kim Jong Kook : 8/10 (4.) Haha : 7/10 (5.) Gary : 5/10 (6.) Jihyo : 3/10  IC : (1.) Yoo Jae-suk : 10/10 (2.) Park Myeong-su : 8.5/10 (3.) Jeong Jun-ha : 8.5/10 (4.) Haha : 7.5/10 (5.) Jeong Hyeong-don : 7/10
koreanvariety,3ayhmd,CraziedHair,2,Wed Jun 24 17:44:36 2015 UTC,"IC : - Ever since NHC scandal, it is obvious that the other members hv extra work to do to fill the void and i would say they do pretty good job. JJH is the most improved. JHD is the least improved but starting to gain his good momentum back. YJS is consistent as usual. HKH addition is sth great. While he didn't bring anything new just yet, he did a very good job to keep up with other members which is very hard to do especially since IC cast hv been together for 10 years. He has positive attitude. PMS is pretty much born to do gag. Haha style doesn't change much but works well with other members' supports.  RM : - YJS and LKS is the most consistent in contributing the good elements. JSJ obviously the most improved. From my POV, the rest is just unimpressive. KJK might hv change character compared to his X-Man and FO days. He did a decent job in throwing funny comment but he is just too good in RM that it wasn't even funny. He has both brain and brawn. Haha, like I said, his style doesn't change much but the lack of support from other members made him less impressive. KG also threw some decent jabs but somehow it looks awkward. SJH is the least impressive one. In some ep, did she even exist though. She good at winning games but that is the only thing that she good at. Still doesn't improved much at variety despite the 5years experience. Overall, the funny banter between the members and guests was contributed by the same members over and over again. Some members seems prefer in being spectators.   1N2D : i don't watch the show in regular basis. the show doesn't hv an obvious center man like YJS in RM and IC. but just judging from some ep that i watched, the overall teamwork is just impressive. each member is very easygoing and can throw good jokes."
koreanvariety,3ayhmd,Secreties,5,Thu Jun 25 00:12:20 2015 UTC,I think 1N2D not having a center man is great because everybody gets a good piece of screen time if they put some effort and the invisible 7th member Mr. PD gets the show going like a MC would do without being seen. 1N2D suffered a lot when Hodong left because he was a HUGE center. Honestly 1N2D and Infinity challenge have given more more laughs consistently than RM for a year now.
koreanvariety,3ayhmd,CraziedHair,1 point,Thu Jun 25 04:42:31 2015 UTC,"I really only watch running man so here is my rating.  Yoo Jae Suk 10/10 - It really doesn't get any better than this. Perfect example of variety.   Lee Kwang Soo 9/10 - Definitely the most improved from the start of the show and probably one of the most if not the most popular across Asia.   Haha 8.5/10 - Works well with almost anyone he's with. Very good variety which is why he's been in a lot of shows.  Gary 8/10 - I see a lot of you putting Gary at the bottom. I highly disagree. He doesn't get the most screen time or the most episode leads but a lot of his scenes are rather funny and he works well with almost any guest. He's also one of the only love lines left wether it be Monday Couple or a guest. KJK seems to shy away from it taking the older brother role. LKS has recently been doing love lines a lot better. Gary is a strong competitor and has his slapstick and witty moments. (sorry so long, felt like I had to defend)  Kim Jong Kook - 8/10 Sparta Kook, if anyone is on here for his strength its KJK, He used to be a lot more versatile but now it seems he's stuck in his role of strong leader. Still damn fun to watch though.   Song Ji Hyo 7.5/10 (10/10 for beauty) The Ace, she always seems to know what is going on. I only gave her such a low score because there was one episode where she clearly won but they cut midway through the scene, skipped to the end, and let the guest win. After this they kind of left her out of a lot of the spotlighted roles and then she decided to do more dramas. Blame production for her limited roles.  Ji Suk Jin 7.5/10 - Probably one of the funnier members, well he has to be. Definitely the weakest competitor. Still has some pretty good moments but can get a little annoying sometimes. Rarely though. It's always fun to see him win something.  FIGHTING"
koreanvariety,3ayhmd,oOcean,2,Wed Jun 24 18:42:23 2015 UTC,jw wondering which episode you're referring to when talking about jihyo
koreanvariety,3ayhmd,snow_rating,1 point,Thu Jun 25 01:20:47 2015 UTC,I'd have to do some research. It was right as the show went from equal competition between cast and guest to more of a way for idols to market a comeback or gain face. I'll reply if I can find it.
koreanvariety,3ayhmd,Isketam,1 point,Thu Jun 25 05:25:56 2015 UTC,"I'll do 1N2D and RM as I prefer them most. 1 - Junho/KJM - Haha/KwangSoo 2 - Junho - Kwangsoo/YJS 3 - Joo-hyuk - Gary/Sukjin/Jihyo 4 - No one - Kwangsoo/YJS 5 - KJM - Haha/Kwangsoo/Kim Jong kook 6 - Chataehyun - JYS 7 - Junho - Kwangsoo/Haha/Kim Jong Kook 8 - Joo-Hyuk - His character hasn't changed at all.  I think the running man cast are declining atm, they are relying on Kwangsoo, Kim Jong Kook and YJS too much, JSJ, Jihyo, Gary are not contributing what they used to contribute, JSJ is a no brainer, he's always been that way but he's still somewhat entertaining but Jihyo and Gary haven't shown the life that they used to.  1N2D, I think Defcon tries WAYYYYYYYYY too hard, It's a general consensus that he's not really interesting, he should try to step up his efforts to try to win games, he seems to concede failure easily where the others try to win. Overall, Junho, KJM and CTH are carrying the show to high ratings, wish the other 3 would step up further."

koreanvariety,3avugy,lupin88,13,Tue Jun 23 22:28:31 2015 UTC,"Another solid episode. It's no surprise the show is doing so well right now. Great editing, natural interactions, as well as guests that commonly don't appear on variety, really sealed in the ratings these past episodes.   I used to be a Running Man fan, but I can unfortunately say I am no longer one. Don't get me wrong, I still love the cast and all, but every episode has gotten really stale. Watching 2Days1Night these past two years really made me realize that shows should stop using heavy scripting and forced storylines. More natural shows like 3MAD and 2D1N are the trend, and writers need to realize that.   That being said, can we acknowledge how adorable MGY is? Every action she does is so darn cute."
koreanvariety,3avugy,SOUPY_BAGEL_VAG,2,Wed Jun 24 04:52:22 2015 UTC,"The reason RM has gotten stale is because they just invite guests all the time. 23 out of 25 episodes this year had guests. The only two that didn't were Yoomes Bond and the LKS episode.  It was so awkward watching the June 21 episode. Other than Jessi, the other guests sort of stood around not knowing what to do while the RM cast would joke around.  Celebrity guests are an ineffective fix to a much larger problem with the show."
koreanvariety,3avugy,dragon_engine,11,Thu Jun 25 18:05:28 2015 UTC,"I've really grown to like the slower pace of 1N2D. They still play games and all, but I love the long scenes of the cast/guests just chatting in the car. Seeing the journey rather than just racing from one segment to the next is one of the real strengths of this show imo.  On a side note: I still enjoy Running Man, but Moon Geun-young looked so much more comfortable and natural in these last two eps than she did on RM. Can't help but think that the forced ""loveline"" with KJK was partly to blame..."
koreanvariety,3avugy,daebak_sageon,-2,Wed Jun 24 02:19:50 2015 UTC,"Country or traveling shows like this have always been popular on Korean television. The key is that the personalities on the show have to match well which 1N2D have done correctly for 3 seasons which is amazing. The last two friendship episodes of 1N2D is in no doubt in response to the celebrity boost shows like Running Man have been having lately. You don't get someone like Moon Geun Young and Park Bo Young just to be a ""regular"" show. If it was Western television that's like getting Jennifer Aniston and Emma Stone on a show at the same time - it just doesn't happen on a regular basis.   Now it seems Running Man is trying to hit back with SNSD  and judging by how the Big Bang episode went - I think Running Man is going to make a surge in viewership when this show comes out."
koreanvariety,3avugy,Hitokiri2,6,Wed Jun 24 03:17:18 2015 UTC,I think the key is not having Kang Ho Dong scream and yell for and hour and a half.
koreanvariety,3avugy,really_cool_name,3,Thu Jun 25 01:02:36 2015 UTC,"The last two friendship episodes of 1N2D is in no doubt in response to the celebrity boost shows like Running Man have been having lately.   So far there has been no ""celebrity boost"" for Running Man. RM has been around 8-10% rating for the past 6 weeks. The Big Bang episode did a 10.7%, whereas the week before RM did 10.3%. A 0.4% increase is almost a rounding error, not a boost. This is one of the problems of RM: They just chain invite guests onto the show, but they struggle anyway.  This is not surprising considering the Big Bang episode of Happy Together recently was the lowest rated episode in the show's history:  http://netizenbuzz.blogspot.com/2015/05/big-bangs-happy-together-episode.html  1N2D got a big boost this last week. They have done 15% easy with no guests before, but this past Sunday they got 17.5%."
koreanvariety,3avugy,dragon_engine,1 point,Thu Jun 25 01:20:31 2015 UTC,"for RM, having guests is a gamble to their ratings. RM now is pretty much just hving anyone in the industry to come as guest. some guest hv star factor or sufficient variety talent/experience  or a big following/fandom to get people watching. some don't hv that. RM now lack the depth they used to have. other than cast interactions, RM now is almost the same as KBS Dream Team.  the ratings of RM could hv been worse if not for the popularity of the cast"
koreanvariety,3avugy,polidarida,-2,Thu Jun 25 23:46:57 2015 UTC,I think you need to look more deeply.   On May 24th according to the Running Man Wikipedia page the ratings was 8.1. The next three weeks 249-251 was all over 10! That's a 2 point difference!   You can read it here >>>> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_Man_%28TV_series%29  So that celebrity boost is a real boost. The episode with Jo Insung and Haha's wife Byul was also big. Nobody could beat 1N2D though with the line up they have and it seems they're doing three shows with the same crowd now since it's going so well.   As you said 1N2D nearly scored a 18 and destroyed everyone else taking 3-4 points from Running Man! That's BIG!   I hope Running Man's SNSD episodes are good and they'll do a 2-3 episode with SNSD as well. I think RM is putting a lot of eggs in the SNSD basket so I hope it pays off.
koreanvariety,3avugy,Hitokiri2,5,Thu Jun 25 01:53:21 2015 UTC,"On May 24th according to the Running Man Wikipedia page the ratings was 8.1. The next three weeks 249-251 was all over 10! That's a 2 point difference!   I think you need to look more deeply.  Yes, there was a 2 point increase in Running Man's ratings comparing May 24th to the next 3 weeks. But what about the 3 weeks before May 24th?      May 3 May 10 May 17 May 24 May 31 June 7 June 14    KBS 1 Night 2 Days 14.0% 13.4% 13.5% 13.9% 14.1% 13.2% 15.5%   MBC Real Men 2 11.9% 11.9% 11.0% 8.9% 10.4% 11.5% 10.9%   SBS Running Man 8.5% 9.2% 9.9% 8.1% 10.3% 10.7% 11.0%   Combined 34.4% 34.5% 34.4% 30.9% 34.8% 35.4% 37.4%    Hmm...looks like there was an abnormal decrease in overall viewership on May 24.  Do you want to know why that is? May 25 was Buddha's birthday, a national holiday in South Korea. That means that a lot of people were enjoying a 4-day weekend.   Ratings for other prime-time shows on May 24 fell as well, including all three on 4:50 PM.    4:50 PM May 17 May 24 May 31    KBS Return of Superman 13.3% 12.6% 14.2%   MBC King of Mask Singer 9.8% 7.5% 10.4%   SBS Take Care of My Dad 5.5% 4.9% 5.4%    So, NO. There was NO 2 point boost. Instead, there was a 2 point DROP on May 24 due to a holiday weekend.  You need to stop cherry-picking data to fit your argument. Also, keep in mind that there are many different variables that affect ratings.   In general, it seems like Running Man enjoys a steady viewership that doesn't change whoever the guest may be. When Running Man fluctuates, it's usually due to Real Men or 1N2D with their own specials."
koreanvariety,3avugy,mkatter,-2,Thu Jun 25 18:43:33 2015 UTC,"Well, its obvious to me no matter what you or anyone says I won't change my mind and you won't switch yours. So there's no real use in going on. It's like a fish in a fish bowl - swim all it wants and as hard as it wants - it'll never get to the river.   Korean variety shows are cool as long as we can agree on that it's good enough for me. :P"
koreanvariety,3avugy,Hitokiri2,3,Thu Jun 25 20:17:28 2015 UTC,"On May 24th according to the Running Man Wikipedia page the ratings was 8.1. The next three weeks 249-251 was all over 10! That's a 2 point difference!   You say look more deeply, but are you? You only looked at four weeks.  Thank you for the data, I'm about to prove my point from the whole year's data.  The ratings start this year at 17.8%, with a steady decline, the lowest point being the 8.1% on May 24th. Your point is that celebrities bring ratings. I disagree.    May 24th (8.8%) had a large number of celebrity guests: Park Jun Hyung (g.o.d), Nichkhun (2PM), Amber (f(x)), Henry (Super Junior M), Kangnam (M.I.B)  April 26th (8.1%) had a large number of celebrity guests: Jang Do Yeon, Jessi, Kim Yoo Ri, Seo Ye Ji, Choa (AOA)  May 3rd (8.5%) had Jinu and Sean of Jinusean  June 21, the most recent episode, scored an all time low 7.4% with celebrities Jessi, San E., Eun Ji Won, Jay Bum, Verbal Jint. You had this data but you ignored it.  What does this mean? Popular celebrities are no indicator that an episode will do well.  In fact, every episode this year except for TWO had celebrity guests, and the ratings range from a high of 17.8% to a 8.1%. That means celebrities are no guarantee that the ratings will be good.    Even worse, only TWO episodes this year had no guests.  January 25th - EP 231 - Yoomes Bond - 10.8%  May 17th - EP 247 - LKS Race with his father - 9.9%  These two no-guest episodes did BETTER than 7 guest episodes this year.  So again - Guests are not creating a bump - The ratings fluctuations are a natural occurrence for the show and happen regardless whether there is a guest or not, and regardless of even WHO is the guest.   So that celebrity boost is a real boost. The episode with Jo Insung and Haha's wife Byul was also big. Nobody could beat 1N2D though with the line up they have and it seems they're doing three shows with the same crowd now since it's going so well.   Again, no. You can't just take 1 week out of an entire set of data and call it conclusive evidence. You have to look at the entire data set.  The Jo In Sung episode scored only an 11%. That is less than 11 other celebrity episodes this season."
koreanvariety,3avugy,dragon_engine,-4,Thu Jun 25 07:10:08 2015 UTC,"Wow you really don't understand the dynamics  of the Korean celebrity world huh? All those names you've listed are all great celebrities but they're all known to be variety show regulars. You know Big Bang, Byul, and Jo Insung shows rose in ratings? Because of their relationship with the RM cast and the fact they don't come out for variety shows often.  Why do you think Korean emcees always point out whether a person does variety shows or not.  Some of the ladies in the recent 1N2D are RARELY even seen in real life! That's the difference between an A level celebrity and an A+ level celebrity. It's that close but it's true.  Believe what you want but I've been watching Korean Variety shows for 15+ years. I think I know what I'm talking about."
koreanvariety,3avugy,Hitokiri2,2,Thu Jun 25 10:34:28 2015 UTC,"You're not quoting data at all. You're not even making an attempt to try to understand how ratings and statistics work.  Instead of trying to insult me, use FACTS and DATA to make a point.  You need to address the fact that Byul and Jo In Sung episode was only 11% which is rated worse than 11 out of 25 episodes this year.  The Big Bang episode scored a 10.7% which is lower than 12 of 25 episodes this year, almost 50%. The Big Bang episode did worse than almost HALF of the episodes this year.   Believe what you want but I've been watching Korean Variety shows for 15+ years. I think I know what I'm talking about.   And apparently you have studied statistics for 0 years. Great, you watched television for 15+ years. That doesn't make you an expert because you can't even prove a point using facts. You're no better than the people online who say ""I have a PHD in this, so you just have to believe what I say, I don't have to explain why."" Your ""15 years of korean variety show experience"" doesn't mean you can say whatever you want and it magically becomes the truth."
koreanvariety,3avugy,dragon_engine,-3,Thu Jun 25 14:25:20 2015 UTC,"Am I really getting into a debate on Korean Variety show ratings? LOL..okay.  The first mistake you make is looking at ratings from a yearly view. Nobody in Korean Variety does that. I bet you each show is probably set up no more then a month ahead since each show has no idea how busy each guest's schedules are going to be or where they're going next. Plus each show has certain ""specials"" that are made to hype up the show and do well for a certain time. No one expects their show to dominate the whole year unless that show is already dominating most of the time.   Let's just look at the three shows that are on at that Sunday time slot: Real Men, 1N2D, and RM. Real Men have specials through the year and the most notable are the female specials that usually run about a month or a month and a half. This obviously is to cause interest, peak ratings, and do well for that month. The female celebrities and the shows are not made to do well the whole year (which you argue) but the special is made to dominate the month which it did when it was on.   Running Man also has specials but does it through getting A+ celebrities or going overseas. Usually when they do this the ratings get a hike and that's why overseas shows are usually 2-3 shows deep. Like the female specials on Real Men, they're not made to make the show popular for a whole year but for a vary amount of time. The same is with 1N2D which also uses the same tactics as RM.  As you said some of the RM shows have done better then the recent shows but that's exactly my point. Ratings go up and down based on celebrities and the  shows that go on. RM is basically the third leg when it is compared to Real Men and 1N2D so their fluctuation is greater then the other two shows.   Again, you have to familiar with Korean Variety shows to notice this thread. This is true of all variety shows. They have specials that spike the ratings then the ratings drops. Unless your show is the dominate show during that time slot that's the truth for most variety shows. Looking at the whole year is to misunderstand how Korean variety shows work. You have to look at it month by month and what specials (if any) are or were on.   Also you said I'm trying to insult you - no I'm not. I haven't called you a name or said any of your ideas were ""dumb"" or anything to the like. I just believe you're not familiar with Korean variety shows and how they are ran."
koreanvariety,3avugy,Hitokiri2,4,Thu Jun 25 15:22:22 2015 UTC,"u/dragon_engine is right. Celebrity guests are supposed to create big jumps in ratings, but it isn't working on Running Man. It works really well for 1 Night 2 Days, but it hardly registers for Running Man. I think this is because Running Man has guests all the time.   The Running Man ratings on the wiki page make it look like it is meaningless as to who is guesting on the show; it will always be number 3. At this rate, if SBS finds a better show than the Dad show, they're going to cancel Running Man."
koreanvariety,3avugy,really_cool_name,4,Thu Jun 25 18:01:46 2015 UTC,"The first mistake you make is looking at ratings from a yearly view.   You realize any sort of work requiring data analysis requires a large sample set? Do you just take anecdotes and one-offs as truth?  You are trying to look at four weeks of data in order to make huge assumptions.   Let's just look at the three shows that are on at that Sunday time slot: Real Men, 1N2D, and RM. Real Men have specials through the year and the most notable are the female specials that usually run about a month or a month and a half. This obviously is to cause interest, peak ratings, and do well for that month. The female celebrities and the shows are not made to do well the whole year (which you argue) but the special is made to dominate the month which it did when it was on.   I'm not commenting on how guests boost ratings on 1n2d. I'm commenting on whether guests boost ratings on Running Man.   In the end you are still missing my point: Celebrity guests do not provide Running Man with a boost beyond its normal ratings range. In fact, it doesn't even matter WHO guests on the show, the ratings will always fall between 8% - 12 %. This is a fact based on all the available data for 2015.  So why is there no ratings boost? Because if you invite guests for every episode of Running Man, it stops being special.  Celebrity guests work for other shows, but NOT Running Man. THAT is what I am getting at.  Jo In Sung on Running Man - 11%  Jo In Sung on 1n2d - 23%  The episode of 1n2d before Jo In Sung was on was a 14.4%, which is close to the average for that show. An almost 10 point jump is a real ratings boost."
koreanvariety,3avugy,dragon_engine,2,Thu Jun 25 15:50:09 2015 UTC,"I agree with you.  Whenever 1N2D bring guests, it's very rare time they do that and they bring top guests, so those guest episodes are ""special"".  However, Running Man does that every week, to the people get sick of those guest episodes to the point their non-guest episodes are called special and have more expectations.  1N2D episodes with guests are like Running Man episodes without guests are not something that happens usually, so it's special."
koreanvariety,3avugy,arumdayo,-5,Sat Jun 27 04:15:35 2015 UTC,"Celebrity guests do not provide Running Man with a boost beyond its normal ratings range. In fact, it doesn't even matter WHO guests on the show, the ratings will always fall between 8% - 12 %.    See here's another mistake. The 12% in which you say is part of the ""the average"". That is the boost. If you want an average you add up all the ratings per week, add them up, and then divide them up by the number of weeks counted. If you did that the average viewership this is about 10.4. If you look at the average of the second half of the shows it's even lower. So anything about a 10 is basically seen as a boost.   Like I said, RM is the third leg in it's time slot. It's not going to see a 10 point jump in ratings because it doesn't have that power. a 2-4 point jump is HUGE! The same is with Real Men. So the way you represent your numbers is not only wrong but misleading.   As I said for 6 weeks in a row (!) the show was under double digit viewership until they had some A+ stars. It's no mistake that their two highest rating shows also had two of the most famous actors in Korea in it in Moon Chae Won and Lee Seungi.   So far I've proven:   Your representation of numbers is misleading and wrong Your assumptions on how ratings work is wrong I've proven that A+ celebrities does work on Running Man by proving that the two most viewed shows had A+ celebrities and it had brought back Running Man to double digit viewership again You've proven in your own numbers that A+ celebrities work on other shows so to say it doesn't work on RM does not make sense."
koreanvariety,3avugy,Hitokiri2,-8,Thu Jun 25 16:11:52 2015 UTC,"I agree, hopefully Running Man invites more idol groups. I know Kara expressed interest to do an episode."
koreanvariety,3avugy,wansuiwansui,10,Wed Jun 24 04:01:54 2015 UTC,"they need to invite people who can take part in the banter.   this platonic friends special is great because everyone is participating.

If you're looking for that close familial setting, Family Outing (1, we don't talk about 2) is a show in which a group of celebrities + 1 guest kinda house-sit for citizens living in the countryside for a day and do things like go fishing together, late night dance parties, and constantly form love lines with anything/everything."
koreanvariety,3at8ah,satisfired,3,Tue Jun 23 10:21:25 2015 UTC,"For me one of the interesting concepts of Roommate was how each person would react to another in close quarters. Even though I believe the situations were scripted I also believe much that was said or done was not.   I know that ""I Live Alone"" is the total opposite of Roommate in many ways but it still keep the same dynamic of how people interact with the world around them when they're alone. It's also fun to here the emcees ask about certain aspects of the person's life and why they do or don't do certain things. Very interesting stuff. The bad things is that finding subbed shows is tough. :("
koreanvariety,3at8ah,Hitokiri2,2,Tue Jun 23 15:23:21 2015 UTC,"I think Family Outing (season 1) is the closest you get to something like Roommate.

Roommate on the other hand is heavily scripted and not as natural or free flowing. It's a big difference in the editing style & directing but there are definitely some similarities"

koreanvariety,3anyj6,Jynxette,9,Mon Jun 22 01:55:41 2015 UTC,"There are subs from 345 onwards. Thats when big subbing platforms like Dramafever, soompitv got the rights to sub them officially and have been doing so week after week.  300-345 was a weird time because small and dedicated sub groups had been playing catch up and were slowly and steadily subbing the episodes from 200-300 when 300-345 was being released. Subs for episodes before 345 are sporadic because episodes were really only subbed if they had public demand.  There are still quite a few gaps between 120-300 (particularly 250-300) and episodes prior to 100 are virtually all un-subbed.  If you can understand chinese then that would be the way to go for IC subs."
koreanvariety,3anyj6,Hyperion98,7,Mon Jun 22 09:26:39 2015 UTC,Long running subbing groups have been from years trying to fill the episodes from 120-300 and earlier but at the pace they can go they take way more than a week to sub one episode so for every episode they subbed there was 3-4 or more new episodes that weren't subbed. That went on Until dramafever took on ep 350 something (i think) giving subs weekly there's a natural gap there.
koreanvariety,3anyj6,deoxix,4,Mon Jun 22 02:03:51 2015 UTC,Still grateful there's some effort to sub them. :)

koreanvariety,3amuom,Hitokiri2,13,Mon Jun 22 15:57:15 2015 UTC,"Looking great!   JTBC Please Take Care of My Refrigerator breaks its record with 4.658% (31st episode). Previous high was last week's 4.615%. The past two weeks featured Hong Jin-young and Park Hyun-bin. JTBC Crime Scene Season 2 records a season high of 1.678% on episode 11. Lowest rating was 1.051% on episode 1. (episode 0 got 0.672%). SBS Jagiya brought in an 8.2%, highest rating since January 22, 2015 (8.3%). MBC My Little Television breaks into the double digits and records its highest rating ever (10.0%). Previous high was last week's 7.5%. The show has aired 9 episodes to date. MBC We Got Married, Infinite Challenge, KBS Immortal Songs all got a boost due to SBS not airing its normal programming. I wonder how much of this boosted viewership will carry over to next week, especially with WGM...   Can't blame SBS because the Hanwha Eagles are finally looking good. Hanhwa finished dead last in the Korean Baseball League 5 times in the last 6 years. They are were the lovable losers in Korean baseball. In order to make the playoffs, you need to be in the top 4 out of the 9 teams. Right now it's highly contested with Hanwha in 5th place but only 3 games behind 1st place. The team is playing out of its mind and it's finally exciting to watch them. Hanwha's fans started calling their team ""marihanwha"" (마리한화), a play on the word marijuana, because they are glued to their TV sets, addicted to watching the games like a drug addict. This nickname spread like wildfire and its been adopted by everyone, including almost every major media network. NC Dinos are in 1st place so the game was important enough to air instead of Oh My Baby and Star King. /baseballrant  Part 2 of KBS 1 Night 2 Days's female friend special raked in a 17.5%!   Real Men (10.3%) and Running Man (7.4%) combined is 17.9%... 17.5% is the highest rating for the show since December 21, 2014 (Part 1 of End of the Year special).  MBC King of Mask Singer's 11.6% rating is its record high. The show has aired 12 episodes to date.   Meh   SBS Oh My Baby and Star King need to recuperate whatever viewership it lost this week due to the baseball game. Star King is in bigger trouble out of the two, in my opinion. SBS Good Sunday (Take Care of My Dad + Running Man) recorded a 6.0%, the lowest rating since September 14, 2014, when it got 4.2%. (On that day, Running Man didn't air so Roommate was solely responsible for the 4.2%)   It also tumbled out of the top 20 programs watched for the day. This also happened before on May 3rd. You have to go back to September 28, 2014 for the second-to-last time it happened.  SBS Running Man records its worst rating since September 28, 2014 (R-pop Star Audition Race). It dropped from 11.0% to 7.4% in one week, a 3.6% difference.    Finale   KBS drama Who Are You: School 2015 aired its last episode on Tuesday (16 episodes total).    Final episode: 8.2% (highest), First episode: 3.8% (lowest) Will be replaced with Hello Monster.  KBS drama The Producers got a whopping 17.7% on its final episode.   Fri. episodes (1,3,5,7,8,9,11): 10.1 < 10.2 < 11.2 < 11.7 < 12.6 < 13.4% Sat. episodes (2,4,6,8,10,12): 10.3 < 11.0 < 13.5 > 13.4 < 14.6 < 17.7%    Upcoming this week   JTBC Crime Scene Season 2 will air its final episode.

KBS's Lady Action (레이디 액션) is in talks of being turned into a regular program. If Lady Action also gets the green light, it will compete with Looking Back At Myself for the same time slots. Source: Star News (in Korean) KBS is preparing new variety show called We Are Siblings (우리는 형제입니다). The show will revolve around stars and their siblings spending 48 hours together. EXID's Hani and her younger brother is confirmed to appear. The show will air sometime in July, presumably after The Producers ends.  KBS's new soccer variety show, Youth FC (청춘FC), has completed its first test on June 1. The show, hosted by former soccer player Ahn Jung-hwan, revolves around those who have failed to achieve their dream of becoming a professional soccer player. Anyone above the age of 18 can apply to join and they will undergo several tests. The best players will be taken to Europe for extensive training. This show will also air sometime in July.  Yoo Jae Suk's show on JTBC will air sometime in August. It's his first venture in to cable. The main producer of the show worked with Yoo Jae Suk on Happy Together back in the day. tvN drama Oh My Ghost (오 나의 귀신님) will start airing on July 3, taking over Ex-Girlfriend Club's old spot.

I wonder if they're going to make a new episode of both shows for next week or to air these weeks and take one week vacation. I would be a little bit pissed if i had to make one episode to not be aired at all. Cheering for the underdog team, anyways.

koreanvariety,3amuom,Markus1990,1 point,Mon Jun 22 01:59:41 2015 UTC,Is there any source that talks real numbers on the viewers? I always wanted to know how many people really watch these shows instead of percentages.
koreanvariety,3amuom,HealerKeeper,4,Sun Jun 21 19:59:00 2015 UTC,"There's no such thing as ""real numbers"" since everything is estimated / extrapolated. Nielsen gets their data by having electronic meters installed in 2000+ households spread around Korea. AGB Nielsen in Korea     All panel household residents and their guests register their presence when in a room with a television set on. Each individual does this by pressing a button allocated to them on the Unitam Meter handset. The metering system monitors all registrations made by each individual for each television in the home.   Nielsen methodology FAQ (in context of Ireland)   Impossible to count the number of individuals so ratings can only reflect the percentage of television-equipped households."

koreanvariety,3am1jv,hubwub,19,Sun Jun 21 15:31:12 2015 UTC,"I still consider myself a hardcore RM fan, but it's no the same anymore. Production staff and writing staff are clearly burned out of good ideas. Cast is funny as always, but they will usually find a way to be, no matter how bad the scenario. YJS could make you laugh with only a rag on a pole.  IMO RM needs to get back to its roots, lots of action, exploration and experimentation, like it was in the beginning. Not everything worked in the early days, but they were trying so many things, not just sticking to a stale formula like they do now.  If I was SBS president, I wouldn't be content with 3rd place. Losing to ""Real Men?"" I'd go into that production office with boiling water and a hatchet, figuratively speaking, starting with the writer's room."
koreanvariety,3am1jv,Markus1990,7,Mon Jun 22 16:35:47 2015 UTC,"I  feel like there's still alot RM can do but the PDs are scared to change the format of inviting guests and short games. The fact that they try to fit like 6 different games into a single episode just shows how they aren't confident in their ideas by making backup games to fill in time. And although this might just be my view, but the overreliance on close up shots on single members to create intrigue compared to the wider shots really cuts the flow of humour and the cast interactions"
koreanvariety,3am1jv,Resistantperm,2,Mon Jun 22 20:33:02 2015 UTC,"And although this might just be my view, but the overreliance on close up shots on single members to create intrigue compared to the wider shots really cuts the flow of humour and the cast interactions   Thank you so much for bringing that up. I've been slowly making my way through the old episodes (though I had watched a few dozen before this attempt) while keeping up with recent ones, and I've noticed that difference in the camera shots as well. There have definitely been times when that kind of close up shot has served its purpose well, but it's fairly frustrating other times, especially as I watch the show for the cast, not the content spoken or done by a single person. There have been funny and unique instances of the latter, but they all would have been even better if the reactions of the rest of the cast were in instant/almost-instant view (and not just in the multiple playbacks from different angles afterwards). That's especially true for simple conversations or opening monologues. Plus, it's all even more inconvenient with the way the show focuses on the guests these days. It's understandable that the guest(s) would be concentrated on, but as I mentioned, I watch the show for the cast, so those close up shots also reduce the amount of opportunities to see the cast members' reactions to or interactions with the guest, unless they waste time to playback several other angles.   The latest episode felt like it had more wider shots than usual, so I appreciated that, but it's still a fairly rare occurrence. =/  May be a silly thought, but I've wondered if when the show was becoming popular, if they added cameras (or the ability to edit footage from far more angles) because they thought they needed it or just because they had been given more access to that option. It's obviously an advantage to have access to a variety of angles, but the show's editing over time has made it seem superfluous to me."
koreanvariety,3am1jv,amelisa28,2,Mon Jun 22 21:12:02 2015 UTC,"That might be it, but I also thought it was because the games have become a lot more static, and indoors, which means they have the capacity to have more cameras at single game sites. But that’s the thing about running man which I won’t ever understand, once they have a concept or something that works for a while, they overuse the concept constantly to the point that it becomes unusable and tired. Like they had find the guest every episode and done, name tag, then spies, then tons of guests, then many mini-games. If they had foresight they would try to change it up, diversify the use of ideas and techniques in between, which would in turn make it a lot more unexpected and interesting."
koreanvariety,3am1jv,Resistantperm,7,Tue Jun 23 00:13:59 2015 UTC,The RM cast has gotten so good at the nametag thing now that they destroy anybody that comes on the show to play the nametag game. They have to play it half heartedly in order to make it seem like it's a close competition. That's not fun at all.
koreanvariety,3am1jv,sportsteambfan,5,Tue Jun 23 04:55:34 2015 UTC,Yes.. and this makes name tag riping game really awkward.  If Jong Kook used his 100% power (like when 2NE1 and 2PM came) he would've ousted everyone in seconds.
koreanvariety,3am1jv,ginastringr,1 point,Tue Jun 23 12:08:59 2015 UTC,"yeah, there are clear clear indications of times where KJK basically just threw his participation for some plot/to make it seem more exciting and close competition.  It's pretty obvious that KJK could 1 v the world the rest of the RM (he pretty much did that in 1 episode where it  literally was everyone vs KJK and him just showing up was enough to intimidate people into submission and the mere fact they had to go up against KJK even when there was a clear numbers game and they just had to gang up on them they were so scared they somehow, rather than grouping up, just split up/separated)"
koreanvariety,3am1jv,aznanimedude,6,Wed Jun 24 19:11:18 2015 UTC,"I agree that RM is not as good as before, and they need to change. But I disagree that RM needs to get back like in the beginning.  Name tag or hide and seek game (for me) is boring, repetitive. Even in the previous episode, name tag game got edited completely.  To bring it even further...I think competition based variety as a whole isn't as popular as 3-5 years ago.  And there's too many awkward moments.   Whether people care or not, we all know there's a lot of scripting in RM (not that it's bad). For example, letting girls win. Or purposely fail the challenge, letting the other teams to win...to keep the competition interesting.  But the main reason is this:   People nowadays watch TV (on Sunday) to relax. This is why Superman is Back, Real Men, King of Mask got high rating. And this is why people prefer 1N2D over RM.  I just recently following 1N2D, even though RM members are much funnier, but I can see why people (adults) prefer to watch 1N2D.  Having said that...I really love RM, the current format and the old format. But we really can't go back.   I like 2 of the previous episodes (the one with Byul and the one with Uee). The games are simple so they can make lots of funny interaction. And both are easy to follow.  The show has changed, people have changed, the industry has changed. There's a clear pattern now on variety industry, RM too should follow it.  Well...this is just my opinion. If you disagree, just ignore it instead of downvoting me."
koreanvariety,3am1jv,ginastringr,3,Tue Jun 23 02:11:41 2015 UTC,"I would quite honestly not mind it at all if they used a less competition minded approach to runningman - which is not to say no competition, but seek out concepts that are a lot less 'win-lose-move on' continuously throughout the show. For example, using episodes where they have to solve tasks together like the baseball one or using a concept like the tea-time where they can actually interact with not necessarily winning just for winning's sake, but to avoid imminent punishment. I would absolutely love watching more episodes like that. There are also concepts like the lee kwang soo day, why not a day in the life of kim jong kook  where they have to do his training routines and compete at singing his songs, or they each get to put together a episode with the pds based on stuff they want to do. I think most people watch because they are fans of the cast and who wins is not important."
koreanvariety,3am1jv,Resistantperm,1 point,Tue Jun 23 06:50:03 2015 UTC,"Korean Netizens on RM articles they always say ""I Want Name Tag Ripping"" because that its Running Man."
koreanvariety,3am1jv,Markus1990,4,Tue Jun 23 02:21:32 2015 UTC,"from my POV, RM is at limits. its purpose now is like to promote the celeb. going back to its old format won't help much actually, given that the members have become very good at games. plus there is a clear difference who is funny among the cast and who wasn't. the lack  of contribution to overall chemistry and interaction from some members is quite obvious.   it gonna take a miracle to save RM ratings without a change of cast."
koreanvariety,3am1jv,polidarida,3,Tue Jun 23 17:10:16 2015 UTC,"I think RM is at an awkward place right now-- there's been a lot of experimentation in recent episodes with different games and formats (not so much this one, I'll admit, which was pretty formulaic and boring games-wise). I think the producers are realizing the show is getting stagnant, and so they're looking for ways to adapt the overall show format since I'm guessing that nametag ripping is no longer feasible as the cast is simultaneously old & injured, yet way more experienced and better at the nametag ripping race than most guests they can bring in.   I'm okay with seeing some inconsistency in episodes for a while as they try out new things and find a format that works. I just hope they find it soon."
koreanvariety,3am1jv,concreteroads,1 point,Tue Jun 23 21:56:22 2015 UTC,SBS is just not creative right now. They're losing on Sunday completely.
koreanvariety,3am1jv,dragon_engine,1 point,Thu Jun 25 01:24:39 2015 UTC,I agree with the production. There is definitely something off with the production since the past 10-12 episodes or so. It just feels really different especially the openers and sound effects
koreanvariety,3am1jv,blarrrgo,7,Mon Jun 29 18:35:15 2015 UTC,"This is funny because many people ask - ""Where is the name tag ripping?!"". Sorry ladies and gents but the cast of Running Man is pretty old now. YJS and JSJ is in their mid upper 40's, KJK is nearly 40, SJH/HaHa/Gary are in the mid 30's, and even Gwang Soo isn't so young anymore.   KJK said on Healing Camp that the producers of Running Man always ask him how he's doing which means - ""How is your physical condition today?"". KJK admits that even though he's in great shape but he has many physical ills that bother him.   Name ripping is entertaining and fun but the Running Man staff probably get pretty beat up in the process. Heck! Look at what happened when the Chinese RM team went up against the Korean RM team - someone ended up in the hospital! Plus let's not forget these guys have others jobs as well and other shows to do. Running Man by far is probably the most physical (depending on what Infinity Challenge is doing) out of all the shows they're on.   Fan can whine all they want but we must remember them as well."
koreanvariety,3am1jv,Hitokiri2,2,Tue Jun 23 23:34:49 2015 UTC,"I have to disagree.  Many minigames the RM cast are playing are extremely physically demanding as well (e.g. the recent chalkboard erasing game, running in mudflats, dodgeball, all the 1v1 wrestling-ish missions).  I would rather they have simpler minigames (e.g. Cup of Tea, Catch the thief, quizzes) and have nametag ripping missions as the final mission. In fact, I think that nametag ripping would not be as tiring because you wouldn't be battling it out continuously. Most of the time would be spent on searching for clues, hiding, wandering around, making alliances, deducing the spies and plotting against other members.  Of course, they can switch it up every now and then, but I really think they should bring nametag ripping missions back at least once every 3-4 episodes?"
koreanvariety,3am1jv,Delfish,1 point,Thu Jun 25 02:03:49 2015 UTC,"This is really well said. It's clear the RM cast has aged and gotten battered over the years. Ji Suk-jin is nearly 50 and I'm still impressed with how active he is on the show. It's probably why the producers don't lock them up overnight anymore, and have them run around with no sleep all night.   At the same time though, they clearly can play nametag ripping games, since they just played last episode and it turned out fine. The short clips of it we did get to see looked fun too. I wouldn't expect them to play every week, but when they get a healthy group of guests it could work. The other problem is that the cast is just too good now, with too much experience, that even characters like the Race Starter are really good at the nametag ripping. I think the onus is on the PDs in this case to come up with a balanced and safe-ish game. (The Chinese = Korean game was let's face it, not balanced at all.)"
koreanvariety,3am1jv,concreteroads,5,Wed Jun 24 13:17:15 2015 UTC,"I liked that they got Jay Park on the show, he needs a little push back in the scene.   Also lol'led at the hearthstone cardbacks at 05:39."

koreanvariety,3am1jv,obake1,12,Tue Jun 23 01:42:46 2015 UTC,"To be honest, if it weren't for the cast, I doubt I'll even be watching Running Man right now. You could say I'm no longer looking forward to the ""Running Man Weekly theme"", instead I'm looking forward towards seeing the cast, how are they, the interaction between them etc. It feels as though the games are just white noise to me and I'm only concentrating on the cast. They're back again with the tiring games which, IMO, don't do the show justice, just because it had been played out and repeated weekly (almost). Somehow, the talk-bingo game from last week caught my attention more due to the fact that they're using their personalities and talk more which express themselves rather than acting out (even though funny and amusing) body gags. But I do have to say, those games would be bad IF there we played once in a while. I understand that it's a variety program, and they are RUNNING MAN (being their initial slogan is Don't walk, run!) that energy straining games/activity is needed, but not for the whole show though.   Also, props to the cast for being badass and a total professional for continuing with the shoot even with injuries. It's clear that Gary had sprained his ankle ( seeing as he's limping and from instagram, someone pointed out in the recent InstaVid that JSJ had post of the closeup of the member, during Gary's part a walking stick/Idon'tknowwhatit'scalled can be seen ), Jihyo also had a plaster on his hand. Not to mention how hard (from what I see) Kwang Soo had kneed himself on his forehead. It's does bother me though, knowing that they're hurt yet they work hard continuing with the filming.   From what I see in the comment section, most people aren't that happy with the episode, also it appears that RM had low ratings for this week. I wouldn't blame the guest though, I found them refreshing, even though they're not good in variety. It's good to see once in a while new guest.   The preview of next week's running man seems interesting, saw Do Sang-woo from JiHyo's drama appearing as a guest (If I'm not wrong)  PS: JiHyo looks so pretty, she's lucky as always.  Again, this are all just my opinion, hope I don't offend anyone and if I  do I'm sorry. I would really love to see what you guys think too. Don't know why there's a few comments being down voted for their opinions though. Have a good day, and hope you enjoy this week's running man."
koreanvariety,3am1jv,JunYiDeWorld,5,Tue Jun 23 10:05:04 2015 UTC,"It's really too bad this episode got such awful ratings. Honestly, while it wasn't a great episode by any means, it certainly wasn't the worst episode in recent memory. I think a combination of factors including the star guests on 1N2D and the fact that the hip hop demographic isn't really the same audience that watches RM combined to make the ratings plummet this weak.  It's true that the games were honestly pretty bad (the first two were alright, but the backpack throwing and final game were just ridiculous), but the cast and guests did their best. I did like how they managed to turn basically every game into a brawl LMAO. It would've been really funny to see an actual nametag ripping race between the two groups."

But Running Man needs to stop relying on small games which lead up to the final ""puzzle"". They've done it for way too many episodes and it seems almost formulaic at this point. This episode doesn't have much rewatch potential since it's not memorable. I would rather they go back to the running ball concept to avoid a punishment, or maybe even ""find the guest"".  Also, Gary definitely should have been the leader for the Hip-Hop club; he was funny throughout this episode and would have done fine as a leader. And the graphics they used were pretty cool."
koreanvariety,3am1jv,sportsteambfan,2,Tue Jun 23 01:49:11 2015 UTC,"I honestly like this ep more than some of the recent ones. The cast was making fun of each other and it had a lot of little jokes, more verbal in nature than slapstick which was more fun to me."
koreanvariety,3am1jv,kelmah,2,Tue Jun 23 04:53:50 2015 UTC,why jihyo doesn't have soul to do running man recently ?
koreanvariety,3am1jv,jsrave,4,Tue Jun 23 11:27:42 2015 UTC,I don't think its soul its just a side effect of having too many guests. When too many guests come on usually the weaker entertainers Gary/Jihyo get pushed back a bit on screen time.   Also at the very end you can see what looks like a taping on her left hand which makes me believe she got injured. That might explain it.
koreanvariety,3am1jv,concreteroads,2,Tue Jun 23 13:19:42 2015 UTC,"I think she just wrapped up her drama shooting for Ex-Girlfriends Club? She's been really sleepy and exhausted-looking in the past when she had drama shoots at the same time as RM. I know a few episodes back the cast was joking around about how Ji-hyo wasn't at the top of her game and had huge under eye circles or something. (I think this was the Kwang-soo is king episode, which is not that long ago.)   She was alright in this episode though, it just wasn't that funny/unique overall."
koreanvariety,3am1jv,Markus1990,1 point,Tue Jun 23 21:52:48 2015 UTC,"her drama was ending days before they shooting this episode, that's not excuse"
koreanvariety,3am1jv,concreteroads,1 point,Wed Jun 24 12:28:35 2015 UTC,"Eh, the live shoot system is apparently no joke. :/ I mean they have actors going to hospital and putting themselves on IV drips and stuff. I assume it takes a while to recover? Like after you come home from a camping trip, or after final exams, and you're just sick & dead for a while. The drama finished airing on June 13, so I'm guessing filming as usual for korean dramas went very close to that date. News for the hip hop special came out like two days after that (I did a quick search and saw June 15), since they film episodes earlier than expected. So I wouldn't be surprised if this episode was very close to the end of her drama shoot.   Also she's usually better in episodes where she has a chance to be physically aggressive. She didn't really do that this episode, maybe because she's not as familiar with the guests so she didn't want to get handsy with them? She was actually pretty good in the first game because she was up against YJS, and in the third game (which was boring as crap but w/e) where all she had to do was talk shit and no physical contact, but in the second game she was against the hip hop guests directly and so she didn't pull any shenanigans."
koreanvariety,3am1jv,amelisa28,3,Wed Jun 24 13:12:46 2015 UTC,"Just to add on to that: in addition to filming during the day on Friday, June 12th, JH (and Byun Yo-Han) also had to shoot another scene later that night, so filming officially would have ended on the same day as the airing of the finale. Plus, there had also been a wrap-up party later that evening, along with possibly another private gathering (based on JH's Weibo and Lee Yoon-Ji's IG) afterwards.   In my opinion though, JH's health and her shooting schedule for Ex-GF Club had both been handled better this time around in comparison to her previous dramas. The physical toll of filming ""Emergency Couple"" had been far more obvious in the RM episodes from around that time, and there weren't any serious hospitalizations reported like the ones that had been reported during ""Gyebaek"" (Source 1 and Source 2).   Also, this is far from a credible statement, but it has always seemed to be me like JH unfortunately is naturally prone to fatigue. But in the past year, at least in the time between EC and Ex-GF Club, I think she'd been working on improving her energy levels. I even recall that in ep 236, she had told Dongjun that she doesn't fall asleep as easily anymore, and that did seem to be the case for a good number of episodes from the months before (with the exception of a few really long trips or driving trips late at night since far more people would easily fall asleep under those circumstances)."

koreanvariety,3am1jv,jsrave,10,Mon Jun 22 23:05:00 2015 UTC,The hip hop club guys aren't really big variety folks outside of Eun Ji Won so hence YJS was placed there to lead them give them direction.  Gary for all his experience on variety still doesn't have the same leadership for entertainment that the other guys have.
koreanvariety,3am1jv,sportsteambfan,4,Tue Jun 23 01:55:12 2015 UTC,Because Gary isn't as good at variety as the 3 you mentioned. Eun ji won is the only variety veteran on the hip hop team so they gave them yoo jae suk to balance it out.
koreanvariety,3am1jv,RyuNoKami,3,Tue Jun 23 04:51:20 2015 UTC,Gary is nowhere as entertaining as any of the other three. Kwang Soo is popular enough to carry an episode solely by antics.

koreanvariety,3al5np,SpCommander,2,Sun Jun 21 13:34:39 2015 UTC,"This is just kind of my opinion.  For shows like Running Man, where guests often participate to promote their dramas, movies, albums, restaurants (chef trend lately), I think the appearance fee is compromised between the PD and the artists because to appear on a prime time show like Running Man to promote (for rookie especially, not mentioning established stars or even regular guests) is a pretty difficult thing to do. Again, just my opinion, no particular number (they sure are not get paid a small amount, but maybe not a hefty one reserved for popular stars like Jung Woo Sung and such, even though he came to promote his movie) Just my two cents.    For 2D1N, you talk about the friends special where they are invited spontaneously and pretty informally. I think the rules regarding this is that every guest is paid an amount (again not having the number in particular) maybe depends on their popularity?? I imagine Jo In Sung gets paid quite an amount and 2D1n is happy to pay him that money because if I am not wrong, he brought their highest rated episode this season. Just my two cents again."
koreanvariety,3al5np,thelegendarynewbie,4,Sun Jun 21 09:46:42 2015 UTC,"If they're invited by the writer, they get paid for sure.

I remember JeDong on IC where it was the summer midnight party and he said to the PD you don't pay me to come here. I forgot what prompted him to say that."
koreanvariety,3al5np,InfamousMike,2,Sun Jun 21 20:48:35 2015 UTC,"they probably get a standard appearance fee for such occasions or it will never air. It can't be negotiated because the fee was decided after the appearance.  For someone like Jo In Sung to randomly show up, management probably allotted to him a higher fee just so MAYBE he would be willing to show up a second time."

If you do watch it, there is a scene where PD Kim Tae Ho ( from KBS in the movie, not IC one) asks for a payment fee where he briefly appears as someone's friend on a show. And then the one who is in charge of the fee states the amount ( which I believe is set fixed for that kind of situation.) Since Producer is supposed to reflect the true side of the variety world in general, I believe there is a set fixed payment."

koreanvariety,3ajnpe,UltraMegaDinoBot,2,Sun Jun 21 14:32:32 2015 UTC,"Not sure if you want one episode appearances or entire shows, but here's what I'd recommend. I would try their appearances on Star Golden Bell and Weekly Idol if you haven't. Gyuri and Nicole appeared on a number of SGB episodes without the rest, but their group episodes are great, especially the idol special with a bunch of groups.  They have some old school shows like Idol Army with Kara or Kara Bakery. They also guested on the Idol Army seasons of other groups before, 2PM comes to mind. Come to Play with SNSD and Kara and Haha Mong Show were other good appearances.   Oh, and Nicole was a regular (until the lawsuit messed things up, but that's almost towards the end of the show anyways) on Heroes, which is pretty similar to Invincible Youth as it has an all female cast, but it's a mix of idols, actresses, and comedians and they do missions like being hotel staff/running a restaurant, etc. It's a really great show overall. Lol I ended up watching it again after looking it up."
koreanvariety,3ajnpe,winterlane,1 point,Tue Jun 23 05:06:10 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the suggestions, I'll be sure to check them out. I watched Heroes before watching Invincible Youth, and I think Heroes is the better of the two, I do remember Nicole leaving suddenly, but I didn't know there was a lawsuit involved, what happened?"
koreanvariety,3ajnpe,Wilbii,1 point,Wed Jun 24 14:29:51 2015 UTC,"Basically, Seungyeon, Nicole, and Jiyoung sued their company (DSP) for an unfair contract. Hara was initially in the lawsuit too, but she quickly changed sides in order to preserve the group, since it looked pretty bad that only Gyuri stayed. Their parents were heavily involved, and a major point was the wife of their original ceo was running the company because the ceo was in the hospital. They were unhappy with the new executive management and the profit division from their Japanese activities. Korean activities were halted for the members suing, though they were still doing Japanese activities since they weren't suing their Japanese agency and had to finish filming a special Kara drama. They ended up settling it with the company and coming to a compromise by ~April of the same year (lawsuit started in Jan 2011)."

They said they're starting a new season, and maybe they're just trying to cycle in new people to keep it fresh? I'm not sure though."
koreanvariety,3ahudn,Laboum-,9,Sat Jun 20 12:30:42 2015 UTC,"I'm surprised they kept Tyler. The way he gets so sensitive when others are talking about USA is quite annoying, yet he has no problems criticizing other countries."

koreanvariety,3ahudn,Jeweles_07,7,Tue Jun 23 01:29:25 2015 UTC,"I'm really curious how they intend to revamp the show so I'll give them the benefit of doubt, but removing half the panel cast is a pretty drastic change.   I found it such a shame that the three new members were taken off even before they had the chance to properly warm their seats.   Frankly, I love Ilya and Takuya, so ya, I'm quite upset about the overhaul. Taking both Julian and Robin off is a surprise. Even though I am not that keen about Julian, I think he adds more to the show than say, Guillaume."
koreanvariety,3ahudn,femacca,4,Sat Jun 20 14:50:14 2015 UTC,I really want to know the three new members more too so it is a shame they are removed so soon. I personally am starting to warm up to Blair's refreshing personality so its sad that he is leaving already.  I agree entirely on Guillaume. He doesn't say much substantial things and they focuses too much on his meat obsession and his cute. At least Julian makes points which are relevant and he knows how to make the show entertaining.
koreanvariety,3ahudn,lovingmonday,7,Sun Jun 21 04:10:18 2015 UTC,"I wonder why Julian and Robin are leaving. Aren't they two of the most popular, iconic members of the panel? Even Takuya, another episode 1 veteran.  I was thinking maybe they asked for volunteers, like they wanted to shake up the format."
koreanvariety,3ahudn,hyperforce,5,Sun Jun 21 15:48:55 2015 UTC,"I know my opinion is probably not going to be popular but I remember a few year back where female Korean speaking foreigners was very in. I think they even had a couple of shows like Abnormal Summit where foreign women would come together and speak to Korean celebrities and talk about social and political issues. This phase was hot for a couple of years but then slipped away and was eventually forgotten.   I think Abnormal Summit is an example of what happened above just that it's happening to the foreign men. I'm not saying anything bad about the show, Koreans, or foreigners  - it's just the cycle of television I guess. I could be wrong but this certainly feels like how it felt back then a few years ago."

He had tried to lessen the pain through acupuncture treatments, but the condition worsened after one week of filming overseas.  However, Jung Jun Ha had already checked-up on his condition immediately after returning to S. Korea, and had underwent a 15 minutes operation.  Source: https://www.facebook.com/KoreanChallenge/posts/828107810598545  (Someone on that page said that this injury is similar to Running Man's Kim Jong Kook which almost made him quit the show.

In Jong Kook's case, even after the surgery he still gets back pain every morning after filming RM (he said that on Healing Camp). IC is hard too, sometimes even harder physically than RM. I'm afraid that he'll quit if his body can't manage.  Well...I'm not a doctor so I could be 100% wrong about this."
koreanvariety,3afbuh,ginastringr,2,Sat Jun 20 03:28:52 2015 UTC,yeah i mean taeho could do more projects that aren't physically straining but i would imagine that'd limit alot of specials and that could make junha feel like he's being a burden to the show :-/  still though... mudo without junha... i don't even want to imagine that

Kyungran, Junghyun, Junseok, and Hyunmin are given special focus in this video.

koreanvariety,3adrpj,onemorelight,3,Fri Jun 19 08:24:58 2015 UTC,"I'm really glad that the three champions reached an understanding, I assumed they might try to take each other down but I always thought their best bet for survival this season is to help each other out.   I think Kyungran will ultimately ally herself with whatever side Sang-min and Jin-ho are on, but the other three you mentioned definitely have a lot of ambition, lol. I could see them starting a coup for sure, along with Yeon-seung who probably still has some closeted bitter feelings from S3."
koreanvariety,3adrpj,concreteroads,6,Fri Jun 19 16:21:10 2015 UTC,"If a non-winner win the frist main match , a winner will probably be chosen for the death match."
koreanvariety,3adrpj,eIworld,4,Fri Jun 19 13:51:30 2015 UTC,"I upvoted you but just now realized maybe that's not so obvious. As an spectator of the game that seems like the best strategy but we gotta remember someone else has to go on that death match and not everyone is willing to go against the goddamn winners, I mean the won for a reason, they're threatening rivals, you wouldn't want to try and take them down all by yourself, not even others winners would try to take down the others in the first round, its too risky."
koreanvariety,3adrpj,KnivesMillions,2,Sat Jun 20 01:31:36 2015 UTC,"I think there's a few obvious picks to be early eliminations, but for this season almost everyone is so strong that as early as ep 3 or 4, there'll be no choice-- everyone you might pick is a champ or runner up of their own season. So I feel like when they're trapped between two hard choices anyways, many of the players will try to use their death match as a chance to take down a champion."

I never had anything against Jungmoon, but I thought she was entertaining because of her love line in Season 1, and never showed any special skills beyond that. She was really good when she came back for the Gyul Hap game in the final episode though, so depending on the games she might show a new side of herself this time."

koreanvariety,3adrpj,eIworld,3,Sat Jun 20 01:26:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah basically, for this kind of show especially it's hard to balance good tv vs. good games. Jungmoon has the advantage of being a cute girl playing the social game... but there are some scary people this time. Kyungran and Sangmin are both amazing political players.

E.g. both running man and infinity challenge were sub illegally by fans before they were picked up by dramafever.

koreanvariety,3a8abh,HorcruxDestroyer,6,Thu Jun 18 00:36:32 2015 UTC,Poor Kwang Soo Yuri has a boyfriend now... Not love line for sure xddd
koreanvariety,3a8abh,RichRikko,3,Thu Jun 18 03:46:17 2015 UTC,SNSD has some strong variety skills in their group! I've always enjoyed the shows they're on!
koreanvariety,3a8abh,goocze,4,Thu Jun 18 20:52:12 2015 UTC,I hope this is true as well. When asked what are the top Running Man shows the SNSD special (the two show one) is usually mentioned as a fan favorite.   Running Man is really turning on the heat when it comes to celebrities to gain viewers and it seems to be working. I'm sure a SNSD Running Man would also make it jump mostly if it's a two episode special like the last tone. That Kwang Soo/Yuri love line...LOL
koreanvariety,3a8abh,Hitokiri2,1 point,Thu Jun 18 01:15:01 2015 UTC,"SNSD special also my first episode of running man. but i don't know, i don't realy want to see them anymore SNSD feel like losing their charm  we'll see if this gonna be good or not"
koreanvariety,3a8cla,neverseenLOTR-AMA,5,Thu Jun 18 00:56:52 2015 UTC,Here are my suggestions  Family Outing - One of the best if not the best show in my opinion  Running Man - Show with a variety of games and fun with cast and celebrities  We Got Married - It's good if you're into romance and Korean celebrities mostly actors and idols  Happy Together - Talk show with cast and celebrities  Infinity Challenge - One of the longest running shows in Korea. A variety of challenges that can take a few episodes to finish  Invincible Youth Season 1 - If you like female idols this is your show. I don't usually like corny varieties like this but this was very entertaining
koreanvariety,3a8cla,Hitokiri2,6,Thu Jun 18 01:12:46 2015 UTC,"TLDR :  If you see Yoo Jae Suk name among the cast, it's very worth watching !"
koreanvariety,3a8cla,YJSubs,2,Thu Jun 18 12:41:54 2015 UTC,Strong heart is good too if you want to hear some personal stories (probably with a lot of adjustments) from celebrities. The beginning before LSG leaving was amazing
koreanvariety,3a8cla,InfamousMike,6,Thu Jun 18 09:18:01 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind Running Man is aimed at a younger demographic. I'd suggest Infinity Challenge or 1N2D, if you're around or over 20. That's not to say you can't enjoy Running Man if you're older, it's not just the demographic. 1N2D & Infinity Challenge are the most popular variety shows in Korea while Running Man is the most popular one internationally because they have idol guests every other episode."
koreanvariety,3a8cla,IClurker,3,Thu Jun 18 06:35:58 2015 UTC,"Please, Op, report back on what you think after you have seen a couple of episodes. I'm curious."
koreanvariety,3a8cla,deoxix,12,Thu Jun 18 18:18:54 2015 UTC,"Running Man is amazing, like almost everyone has suggested so far. I'd start with older episodes though, since the quality of episodes has been more inconsistent recently. It's very active and appeals to a wide audience.   Na PD's shows are all fantastic. Any X over Flowers is probably a safe bet, versus 3 Meals a Day is quieter and might not be as interesting. If you go back, the old 1N2D when he was still directing and when they had the old cast, is also very enjoyable.   If you like American crime shows/guessing games, Crime Scene and Crime Scene 2 are incredibly well done, and the cast of both seasons are fantastic. They manage to present twisty, intriguing murder cases while still injecting humour and banter into everything they do. If I had to recommend one to start, I'd actually say Season 2 has a better cast and is funnier, but they're both great.   If you're into more intellectual television normally, or fancy yourself smart/like board games and such, you might also want to try The Genius. It has three seasons, and is kind of like an American game show or the Japanese manga/anime Liar Game, but about a hundred times funnier."
koreanvariety,3a8cla,concreteroads,3,Thu Jun 18 02:39:39 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your help. I saw the crime scene banner on the side there, when you say Crime Scene 2, is that like season two?"
koreanvariety,3a8cla,femacca,2,Thu Jun 18 05:38:03 2015 UTC,"Yes, Crime Scene 2 featured on the sider banner refers to the 2nd season of Crime Scene. You can find the Eng subbed episodes for both seasons here. Season 2 will end next week.  By the way, the wonder-subber for Crime Scene Bumdidlyump does the Eng subs for The Genius too, should you be interested to pick it up."
koreanvariety,3a8cla,concreteroads,2,Thu Jun 18 11:13:36 2015 UTC,"Yep, Crime Scene has two seasons. So Crime Scene 2 is a separate season with a separate cast and format (and even overall ""feel"")."
koreanvariety,3a8cla,gr1zzlybear,5,Thu Jun 18 13:57:10 2015 UTC,"Anything by Na PD. Grandpas Over Flowers, Grandmas over Flowers, Youth over Flowers, and 3 Meals a Day. Absolutely hilarious and easy to watch shows, Na PD is just so good at variety!"

koreanvariety,3a8cla,berryzsaya,5,Thu Jun 18 05:35:55 2015 UTC,The titles are probably inspired by the idol drama Boys Over Flowers  which was wildly popular some years ago. Koreans refer to pretty boys as flower boys.

koreanvariety,3a8cla,d0uble0h,2,Thu Jun 18 01:07:50 2015 UTC,"For variety, it depends on the type of show you would like. Running Man is incredibly popular because it has idol/actors/actresses guesting every episode. If you like that sort of thing, then Running Man. I loved the first 150/160 episodes of Running Man because they focused more on cast interactions, but these days the games I loved are never played and the cast has taken a back seat. It's all about the guests so I don't watch anymore. (Most idols are completely fake on every TV show to maintain their perfect image, so it's like wasting 90 minutes to me).  Happy Together (available via KBSWorld on youtube) also has guests on every week, but there's no games. Just discussions with various celeb guests.  I like shows where it's usually just the cast, they all work well together and don't have to take care of guests. They can be comfortable and it's always funny.   Infinity Challenge is an obvious one, because most of them have been working on it together for 10 years.   1 Night 2 Days is another one I watch regularly. Season 1 is my favourite variety show ever, KBSWorld on youtube are currently uploading subbed episodes of S1. S3 is currently airing, and KBSWorld upload a new episode every Sunday. Season 3 is available here. They are a bit awkward together at first, but they soon settle in. The episodes towards the summer of 2014 are great TV. The show was almost hitting 20% in ratings around that time if I'm remembering correctly (most weekend varities average between 8% - 15%).  Family Outing is an older show from 5/6 years ago that was great. Kshowonline have all the episodes I think.  FYI: When you hear Season 1, Season 2 or whatever, that just means there has been a change of cast usually. You can skip seasons in most variety shows and not be lost. To watch Season 3 or 1n2d you won't need to have seen S1 & 2 for example."

I find all of these shows extremely enjoyable and really funny."

koreanvariety,3a8cla,mermaidleesi,1 point,Thu Jun 18 01:39:14 2015 UTC,"I would say Running Man... the chemistry the cast has with each other is amazing. The early episodes weren't awful, but might be hard for you to get into, so I say for starters, check this list out and pick one that sounds good to you so you can see how good the show can be. If you like idols, try the SNSD two part episodes 63,64 for starters.  https://www.facebook.com/notes/jeremy-sweetman/top-10-or-30-running-man-episodes/10151507746673142"

You could also give their ""We Got Married"" special a shot (What if.. 363-365), but I think that special would be more enjoyable if you get to know HongChul first."

koreanvariety,3a7b7p,Jynxette,3,Thu Jun 18 00:03:16 2015 UTC,"I really recommend watching from 419 when they are recruiting their newest member - to the most recent episode, continuing to watch it weekly. Then start from around 301 to 418. In my experience there's a lot of missing episodes but they are still fun to watch. Then from there go from the earliest episode to 300."

It definetely doesnt capture the essence of IC which is simply interaction between the cast members. Even before Gil joined it was good. Try to watch the ones when Noh Hong Chul was on, he was a really important member"
koreanvariety,3a7b7p,aziaddict,2,Fri Jun 19 03:03:49 2015 UTC,"I started as a fan of Family Outing and Running Man. I thought for a long while that RM was the best show ever with all the adrenaline rush and suspense but now its too scripted and they focus too much on games and forced gag. IC focuses more on the cast and how they take on many different challenges, the cast is not good looking, strong, or charismatic. But thats what making them so charming and they are really funny guys.  I started watching the music festivals since I was a fan of G-Dragon, if you are you can start watching them. There are so many good episodes, it really depends, but when you start liking the guys you will love the show. Just be sure to watch a long project from the start. Dont have to watch all the episodes chronologically, just check which project/episode sound good and Go on wiki Infinite Challenge episodes list   My favorite to start with:   https://charliemarnie.wordpress.com/2010/08/07/infinity-challenge-episode-165/    -2011 or 2013 music festival project  -Survival island !!!!!!!!!!!   It probably will take some time to get used to them and the comedy style, like I said none of them are that attractive physically lol so no eye candy and its not based on games unlike RM, its really the interactions and their personality. Let me know when you get addicted ;)"

koreanvariety,3a7b7p,Reyvaan,1 point,Thu Jun 18 06:50:10 2015 UTC,I suggest just going on Dramafever and starting from where they subbed. It's not that difficult to figure out what's happening.

koreanvariety,3a7b7p,dreamraine,-7,Sat Jun 20 21:39:41 2015 UTC,it is BORING  they have more creative ideas and games than RM but the interactions between the members etc is just so lackluster  a lot of episodes consists of the members just sitting around and talking and their dialogues are just not as funny as the RM cast  There is a reason why despite it being around for so much longer than RM and YJS and HaHa being on it for so long it took RM for YJS and HaHa gain international recognition (only hardcore Kpop/kvariety fans don't count)  the reason is that the idea is there but the execution needs more work
koreanvariety,3a5fwq,brainiac41,15,Wed Jun 17 11:10:09 2015 UTC,"HOLY CRAP I love all of these cast members so much. Seriously, I don't even need games or anything-- I would probably watch it if the show locked all these guys up in a room and let them bicker for an hour every week. I'm excited to see what new pairings will happen in S4... I thought everyone would be stuck in alliances from previous seasons, but this teaser and its interesting pairings seems to indicate otherwise. I'm pretty sure all the people the posters paired up as ""rivals"" will actually turn out to be allies haha. LOL at Junseok and Yoohyun: ""... looks like we're the prime candidates for first elimination this time again"" ""omg don't say that!""  Also haha oh Hyun-min, still as cocky as ever. ""I was a total fan of [Jung-moon]... not cause she was good or anything, though."" Also hahahaha I think he might be the first person ever to cheer for himself in third-person: ""Oh Hyunmin fighting! Oh... and Choi Jungmoon fighting.""   I'm honestly most excited for the three winners though. Because they're such bros, even as Jin-ho and Dong-min pretend to be at each others throats and Sang-min pretends to look at them with total disinterest/disdain. (Giant bs LOL at Sang-min saying he hopes the S4 winner will be known for fair play though....) They're saying they won't team up now, but... lol they're totally going to end up teaming up, there's no other way for them to survive. Like my favourite moment between the three:  Jinho: ""I'm going to crush [Dong-min], piece by piece.""  Sangmin: ""Eh, just crush him. Why does it have to be piece by piece?"""
koreanvariety,3a5fwq,concreteroads,3,Wed Jun 17 14:56:04 2015 UTC,"No retort of ""beans/Kong are best served peeled"" (a running joke from his Starcraft days). I'm disappointed. Jinho fumbles his words again - he's endearing to the max. He's my personal favourite along with Dongmin. I can't wait to see them bring their banter over from Crime Scene.   If I were one of the players, I will definitely be wary of teaming up with Sangmin. He has a ready pawn in Kyunghoon. Yoohyun is easily swayed so he has to be more careful. I'd laugh my head off if Yohwan gets fooled again.   Hyunmin and Jungmoon will develop a loveline, a staple in Korean variety. Hyunmin will now have to protect his love interest while conquering the games. There, I've written the script.  There are five 'mature' players this season in Junghyun, Yeonseung, Kyungran, Yoonsun and Sangmin, vs three young 'uns in Hyunmin, Jungmoon and Kyunghoon. Jinho, Dongmin, Yohwan, Junseok and Yoohyun are in the middle. A battle of the ages?"
koreanvariety,3a5fwq,femacca,1 point,Thu Jun 18 02:09:52 2015 UTC,"Yeah I loved Dong-min and Kong together in Crime Scene! Excited to see them hopefully carry over that bickering camaraderie and work to keep each other alive in this season.   LOL I think everyone at this point is wary of teaming up with Sang-min, even the original troll Im Yo-hwan. I think Kyung-hoon actually isn't as ditzy as he seems: not ditzy enough to fall for Sang-min's ploy anyways, but he might do it just for fun.... Sang-min is actually one of the few players I consider truly ""extraordinary"" by Yeon-seung's definition, and so although I'd like to say the S4 players are smarter than that... I think Sang-min's shtick will still work for another season, alas. He's simply a master manipulator with no comparison.  Totally agree with you on the love line, but I really don't want to see it happen. >___< This is why when the S4 roster was first announced, I was like... why would you bring back Jung-moon without Choi Chang-yeop?! D: I loved that love line and I can't really see Hyun-min doing his best in any sort of love arc lmao. He's honestly just a big giant baby to be doted on by all the hyungs and noonas.   I actually can't see the age thing happening, although that's an interesting division. If I could write the script, I'd probably say: Junghyun and Yeonsung, perhaps sometimes working with Kyungran and Yoonsun. Yoohyun will try to restart his partnership with Yeonsung but I think that will fall apart quickly from lack of trust. Because the phoenix and the doc are definitely the most mature and wise of all the players, and I think by this point the others respect them for that. Both will have also learned a lot from their respective seasons about not getting on the wrong side of the powerhouse alliance this time, so they'll be seeking to present a strong united front from the start. Kyung-ran shines the most surrounded by people, so I could see her enlisting the two other girls, and perhaps Sang-min. Kyunghoon and Yohwan will be around stirring shit up and playing into the three champions' hands, while Jun-seok and Yoohyun flit in and out of the others' traps. Meanwhile Hyun-min will be trying to make it on his own this season, but realize that he can't and once again end up hiding behind a charismatic leader such as Dong-min (unlikely, based on preview) or even Sang-min. Jin-ho will try to ally with Dong-min once he realizes that half the cast wants to kill him, but this puts him into a role overlap with Hyun-min unfortunately. I think his best bet will then be to change sides and align himself with the girls (he's worked well with all three of them before), and maybe Yeonsung/Junghyun/Yoohyun.   (This differs from my personal hope, which is that Jinho and Hyunmin will successfully work together and be all cutesy like they were in the S3 BTS, and that Sang-min will work with Kyung-ran and maybe Yeon-seung [like they did that one episode where Jinho and Sangmin guested] and show the softer side of himself that he did in S1 before he turned into a huge ass.)"

koreanvariety,3a5fwq,bduddy,1 point,Sun Jun 21 08:43:33 2015 UTC,"I do think Yohwan is smarter than most people gave him credit for in Season 2. However, a lot of his portrayal was all on him... the kneeling to Jin-ho, and giving up on any sense of shame pretty early on in the season. His play in the final was also deeply questionable in some aspects (honestly, I thought he went crazy for a little bit in the second game of the final match). The Genius's players have stated before in interviews that the show doesn't ""edit maliciously"", and so I think if Yohwan looks like a desperate troll in a lot of the main matches, that's probably at least somewhat reflective of how he acted for real.  Kyung-hoon on the other hand is just a totally different planet, and I love him hahahaha. He has the mentality of approximately a five year old."

Any idea when 1N2D LA will be showing? It was meant to be filmed this month or are filming right now.  Any idea what song was played at Shinji's introduction?"
koreanvariety,3a4pxt,oOcean,2,Thu Jun 18 00:04:23 2015 UTC,They are delaying filming for the LA trip because of MERS. They were originally supposed to leave Korea on June 22. Looks like they were going to tour Koreatown.
koreanvariety,3a4pxt,mkatter,2,Thu Jun 18 00:41:57 2015 UTC,don't have a clue but i guess we should be expecting it early july  here's the song used for shinji's intro

koreanvariety,3a40sc,IClurker,5,Wed Jun 17 05:12:13 2015 UTC,Gonna be tough for HaHa. RM and IC filming and now Law of jungle.
koreanvariety,3a40sc,Enter_Text_Here,7,Wed Jun 17 03:58:31 2015 UTC,god bless chanyeol for returning since exo has dedicated fan subbers
koreanvariety,3a40sc,lupin88,2,Wed Jun 17 03:42:20 2015 UTC,"I'm super stock to see HaHa is going to be filming LOTJ, but the thing is, there aren't that many ( maybe there's not one at all idk ) regular subs of the show. I did see people mention that there's a few idols and that scenes of them will be sub, but it's just cut scenes of the idols, and I don't think that's very enjoyable at all. I would much rather watch the show with full context as to what all the cast are doing and going through.   That's just my opinion though, would really hope someone would sub this series, it's actually one of (if not) the best variety shows I've seen."
koreanvariety,3a40sc,JunYiDeWorld,1 point,Wed Jun 17 10:04:08 2015 UTC,"Yes, there is not a ""regular subber"" for Law of the Jungle, but the one with Chanyeol was subbed by his fans, so there is a good chance this one will be subbed anyway  Especially since the LOTJ episodes with him were fully subbed, not just his own sniplets"
koreanvariety,3a40sc,FFridge,1 point,Wed Jun 17 20:44:22 2015 UTC,"Yes! More Law of the Jungle that will be subbed! Indian Ocean was my first time watching, really fun and entertaining. It has to be one of the highest rated Variety shows with no consistent subbers."

koreanvariety,3a6ajz,realistic_me,10,Wed Jun 17 15:49:13 2015 UTC,"I'd love to see him back but he's so popular now it's pretty much a guarantee it won't happen. At the time he left his drama shoots meant that he could only attend every other week anyways, so it's probably worse now that he has a constant stream of job offers. Over the years the other members have become as much variety entertainers as they are their other careers, but Joong-ki left so early that he's still really an actor and not a broadcaster.  I know RM fans tend to be divided over how useful Joong-ki actually was on the show, but I always liked him and I feel like now that the show is trying to change things around to avoid stagnation, it's a better time than ever to do stuff like adding another member. It's just that practically speaking they won't be able to make it happen-- I mean with his current drama already starting up, he was so busy that he could only come visit the set for a little bit, not even guest for a full episode."
koreanvariety,3a6ajz,concreteroads,4,Wed Jun 17 16:15:28 2015 UTC,"He was okay. imo he didn't drag any episodes down, but I can't remember any great moments with him either."
koreanvariety,3a6ajz,tiniesttaco,2,Wed Jun 17 17:23:30 2015 UTC,"I thought the Song-Song sibling line was super cute! While he definitely wasn't the funniest of the members, what I still remember about Joong-ki is how he contributed to the nametag ripping race. He was the one who came up with a lot of their original chasing strategies, like divide and conquer. Sure, they often failed a lot in execution (partially because he was just unlucky lol, always getting outed first, but partially because of his ""Hot-Blooded Youth"" character) but the seed for a lot of their tactics definitely originated with him."
koreanvariety,3a6ajz,concreteroads,5,Wed Jun 17 18:33:57 2015 UTC,"At one point they were going to make Lizzy (Afterschool) a permanent, but that never happened. I was disappointed when that fell through, 'coz having a 2nd female member would have been great, even if it was not Lizzy but someone else."
koreanvariety,3a6ajz,Enter_Text_Here,5,Wed Jun 17 19:14:44 2015 UTC,She did became a permanent member it was announced in episode 19's opening but she left the show because she was receiving so many hateful comments.
koreanvariety,3a6ajz,Tharmy,2,Wed Jun 17 20:17:48 2015 UTC,Really? I thought she was good. She fitted in well with the members and they (male members) seemed to adored her since she was the Maknae.
koreanvariety,3a6ajz,Enter_Text_Here,3,Thu Jun 18 04:47:56 2015 UTC,Last episode (Ep 251) felt like he wanted to just stay there and play with his hyungs and noona. I miss seeing him in Running Man :(
koreanvariety,3a6ajz,Bananauyu,2,Thu Jun 18 08:03:42 2015 UTC,nope. he just there for his face.  he is boring

The show was becoming good when joonki was not there anymore."
koreanvariety,3a6ajz,RichRikko,1 point,Wed Jun 17 21:59:44 2015 UTC,It was not that long after he left that the show became tiresome and worse.

koreanvariety,3a0h6n,kyugi0923,7,Tue Jun 16 07:03:53 2015 UTC,"I'm guessing Jinho comes up with a plan and tries to get some people to join him with the plan. Then said people betray him in some capacity. Rather than tell him that they won't work with him, they play along and trick Jinho. Finally, Jinho is perplexed because he probably thinks that the plan is fullproof, but people don't want to follow his plan for one reason or another."

koreanvariety,3a0h6n,concreteroads,2,Tue Jun 16 10:39:44 2015 UTC,"I've definitely seen misleading preview clips. Sometimes preview clips for episodes will feature some dramatic, over-the-top moments that imply something astounding will happen. But then it turns out having taken place in the beginning entry/chatter and not relevant to the games at all. That's the most messing around and misleading they do, though."

His outburst at the end is pretty typical of him, whether or not he's actually super mad, but the earlier clips showed him getting annoyed for real, I think. He's so right though, there definitely aren't normal people in S4. :P I'm pretty sure the producers brought Titty God Kyunghoon back 100% to be a troll lmao.   He's definitely going to get targeted though, just because he's such a high profile character. It's too bad, because while I love Jin-ho and want to see him until the end, I actually don't think he has the most extraordinary skills of the cast of S4. Who should the players target in that respect? Probably Hyun-min for pure gaming ability and Sang-min for political ability. But as it happens, while almost everyone else has allies from previous seasons (2Min; Kyungran and Sangmin; Yoohyun and Yeonseung), the people who worked with Jin-ho (like most of the people who worked with Dong-min too) had an unfortunate tendency to get themselves eliminated lol."

Also you'd be able to avoid spoilers about the winners from previous season. All season are fantastic in my opinion so i highly recommend you just go for it.

koreanvariety,39zpq0,soothingday,4,Tue Jun 16 06:01:50 2015 UTC,"it's because apparently he ""mistreats"" ftisland, the band that pioneered fnc's success, by giving everything (promotions, comebacks, etc) to his other groups--cnblue in particular  hongki (ftisland's vocalist) and the ceo are also known for publicly badmouthing eachother but everyone just flocks to hongki's side and takes it out of context imo. i watched the fnc variety show, cheongdamdong 111, and they did exactly that in the show towards eachother. to me they genuinely looked like close friends screwing around but who knows what really goes on behind the scenes."

The difference is agency looking for the jobs for the artist instead station broadcasting is looking for one, so more job and giving facility to artist if the agency big enough(car, manager, makeup artist etc.)  as far as i know JHD really struggle without manager since he's driving himself."
koreanvariety,39zpq0,VanillaEclair,1 point,Tue Jun 16 12:44:36 2015 UTC,I'm sure getting a manager to drive him wasn't his only reason for signing with an agency. Pretty sure he could just hire his own personal manager.

It seems ""Take Care of My Dad,"" as the first show in the Good Sunday slot, still ends up being prioritized first in regard to running time.

koreanvariety,39xp68,icanbeyourzero,10,Mon Jun 15 20:46:17 2015 UTC,The Monday Couple vs Haha/Byul match was one of the funniest things I've seen on the show in a long time.
koreanvariety,39xp68,natcookie,4,Mon Jun 15 23:33:43 2015 UTC,"this is my favorite part! we all can see how different haha is when he's paired w/ his wife (those captions are hilarious too). not to mention haha and gary's back and forth bickering is so funny, i laughed a lot.   the only downside of this ep is we don't get to see sukjin's and jaesuk's wives, i really want to know how well they do on variety shows, especially on where their husbands work."

koreanvariety,39xp68,natcookie,2,Mon Jun 15 23:19:24 2015 UTC,i noticed that too. what a sweet guy he is.
koreanvariety,39xp68,JunYiDeWorld,11,Tue Jun 16 01:10:21 2015 UTC,"This episode was refreshing to watch, with old faces making sudden appearances, made it if not, among one of the few best episode in 2015.  It's really heartwarming to see how Haha and Byul are on a variety show. The pre-game was entertaining to watch too, with the funny back-and-forth interaction between Gary and HaHa. The Talk bingo was a nice touch too, able to see the cast talk comfortably instead of just doing body gags and tiring games.   Also like everyone had stated, it was really nice seeing how the RM cast know what their members would choose (KJK knowing what LKS would choose and YJS knowing JSJ). The name-tag ripping was pleasant to see too, for a few minutes, making a small comeback.  Lastly, as a mc shipper, it's hard to admit it but this episode really shows how the mc is coming to an (subtle) end. The starting was very interesting and seeing them back together as a team was fun, but it slowly fades as the episode goes on, and at the end about what Gary said, maybe it is time for the MC to end. Don't get me wrong, I LOVE the Monday Couple, like really a lot, but I personally think it's no use forcing something that's already played out, and maybe the MC title is tying them down and preventing them from doing other bigger things. I do really appreciate what The Monday Couple had given us, all those funny and wonderful moments, and I do hope to see them at their best in the future. MC couple's moments will also be remembered even when MC is no long together.   All of it is just my own personal opinion and I hope I don't offend anyone, if I do I'm sorry and hope you guys enjoy this week's RM. Have a good day. :)"
koreanvariety,39xp68,Strawcrazyman,3,Tue Jun 16 07:26:49 2015 UTC,"I agree. I'll always have fond memories of mc, and I'm sure they'll always have great chemistry as friends, but there's no use trying to force it."

koreanvariety,39xp68,Isketam,3,Thu Jun 18 04:26:59 2015 UTC,"The first 16 minutes into the show I already laughed so much with the guests introduction plus the surprised visit from Joong Ki, In Sung and Ju Hwan.  The musical couple also fun to watch, they are so romantic during the Talk Bingo.  And Haha showing his 'Dream's daddy' power, I commend him for that.  Too bad they cut-off short the name tag mission, was hoping to see more of it."
koreanvariety,39xp68,concreteroads,5,Tue Jun 16 02:00:58 2015 UTC,"Loved this episode! I laughed so much. The games and the dynamics all around were good, and of course I loved the Joong-ki et al cameo.  Haha was super manly and different from usual, and him and Byul are totally adorable. The guest couple was really cute too. It was such a hilarious contrast between their lovey-dovey romantic-ness versus Ji-hyo sitting there like a grinch being like: ""oh god don't sing me a song :| don't send me flowers damn it"". But then at the end I'm pretty sure Ji-hyo shrieked the loudest (although Jong-kook and Kwang-soo did have their hands clasped like girls in anticipation during the final game). I also liked how they clearly addressed that the MC is a fake/business relationship.   I do wish they'd showed more of the nametag ripping though. D: I thought maybe because it was boring, but it actually looked really fun. Also Jae-suk and Jong-kook were taken down by a girl! Which is always fun to see."
koreanvariety,39xp68,loveleeyh,-1,Tue Jun 16 04:21:49 2015 UTC,"Also Jae-suk and Jong-kook were taken down by a girl! Which is always fun to see.   Because she's stronger than them, amirite?"
koreanvariety,39xp68,concreteroads,-3,Wed Jun 17 15:26:15 2015 UTC,"Well I mean with Jong-kook, he's clearly going easy. But it's hard to tell with Jae-suk lol. I'm pretty sure Ji-hyo has really taken him down before. Also with the name tag game JK/JS were clearly at a disadvantage anyways since they didn't manage to unlock their chain, so it was more strategy + agility rather than strength at that point. And Byul is freaking fierce (I think Jae-suk might've actually lost to her in the first game, since I doubt he was expecting her to jump the platform and rush him.)"
koreanvariety,39xp68,Jessluv7,0,Wed Jun 17 16:09:37 2015 UTC,Jae-suk does not always use his strength to win so I wouldn't take him losing to Ji-hyo or many other guests as him being weaker than them...his main goal in variety is always to make the audience laugh
koreanvariety,39xp68,concreteroads,-1,Thu Jun 18 07:27:39 2015 UTC,"I didn't say Jae-suk was weaker necessarily, I said it's hard to tell. He's definitely stronger than he lets on, but his build also means he's naturally weaker than the buffer boys like Gary or Jong-kook.  I am saying that he and Jong-kook were at a surprising disadvantage in the nametag ripping game, since they were still chained together while Byul and Haha managed to free themselves. And also that even the strongest players can be caught off guard with a good surprise attack, which Byul was awesome at."
koreanvariety,39xp68,stijnx,4,Thu Jun 18 13:56:03 2015 UTC,"Interesting how they basically skipped the name tag game, used to be their bread & butter."

koreanvariety,39xp68,runaway4231,3,Tue Jun 16 04:46:51 2015 UTC,"I've only noticed today too and quickly googled it.    The Mystery: See, it's no secret that Gary has tattoos (a pretty awesome one I might add). But when it comes to Running Man, he usually has to cover it up with a bandaid or a cloth, otherwise the production team will censor it. I've wondered for a long time why Gary would cover up his tattoos on Running Man, or why they would censor it in the first place.  Debunked: I did a little research on the side and found out why. It's just that Korean culture considers tattoos to be improper. It's largely a cultural thing. That's why Gary has to cover up his tattoos while on the show. source   Not sure about why GD's case though. It's been what 5 years and I just known today that Gary has tattoos. LOL"
koreanvariety,39xp68,FobbyDigital,2,Tue Jun 16 05:00:43 2015 UTC,As a Korean American I'm constantly reminded how conservative Korea is.
koreanvariety,39xp68,Enter_Text_Here,-2,Tue Jun 16 22:10:29 2015 UTC,3 Sponsored brand censorship   Most of the time you can tell what brand it is when they put the tape over the clothing name/logo.
koreanvariety,39xp68,runaway4231,1 point,Tue Jun 16 07:08:54 2015 UTC,"It is but every korean show does this. Dramas also blur out brand names unless it sponsored the show/episode and there's only a specific time that it is allowed. The Broadcasting Board of Korea monitors this and a show can be warned for over-exposing sponsored products. They can't even mention brand names if it's not a sponsor.    In Korean shows, official sponsors are included in the end credits via a banner display. On the other hand, non-paid placements have the brand’s logo erased or simply hidden. This outline clearly points out which brands financially backed up the show’s production costs.  Since variety shows probably can't be bothered further processing the video to blur out the brand names, they do it manually. It's probably in MuDo where YJS has joked and mentioned the cost of adding CGI effects."

koreanvariety,39xp68,amelisa28,4,Tue Jun 16 07:20:43 2015 UTC,"There is a moderate age difference between them: 8 years, but it's not that significant compared to the age differences of other similar celebrity couples (especially the ones in which the male half is an MC). JS and his wife even have a difference of 9 years between their ages.   But you're definitely not alone in being surprised since there had been a similar reaction back in 2010: http://www.allkpop.com/article/2010/05/ji-suk-jins-wife-is-a-hot-topic  Also, for a while, SJ and his family were on another variety show, and from the clips I've seen, his wife looked a lot younger than her age (and obviously/still pretty) on there as well. So if you want to check them out since this ep only had that lone picture, here are the YouTube links for two clips from the other variety show:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tS0GEIJbq4o https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hrbslH4zBg (after 2:06)"

I mean if you could just quit a contract and go back on TV the next day, what's the point of a contract..  Relatively speaking though, he's pretty much free now. That's much better than whatever hell JYJ is in despite it being forever since they broke up.  Yeah also maybe a lot of it is just SM has more pull than JYP, what do I know."

I started from 319 to the newest episode and it really helped new viewers ease in imo. The pattern I'm going through is 300-400, 200-399, 100-299.

koreanvariety,39w84b,JunYiDeWorld,6,Mon Jun 15 08:31:05 2015 UTC,"The highlights of the Solim couple I think were in their earlier episodes, when they were still within the circle of MinYoung and JjongAh). Something just didn't click as well as before ever since the scandal (wish it never happened, or at least remained hidden for the sake of the fans). Still though, they are definitely one of, if not, my favorite couple in the history of WGM. Their relationship is just so straightforward and sincere. I think this had to do with their relatively older age and the fact that they actually have experienced being in love before. Totally gonna miss everything about the two, especially Jae Rim's cheesy lines.  Henry and Yewon ending was just imminent, too bad they didn't even get a proper mission card.  As for new couples, Sungjae and Joy reminds me a lot of the young-idol-pairing in WGM, kinda like Taemin and Naeun (oh look, they even come from the same companies). I also think Oh Min Suk and Kang Ye Won actually have potential, their preview got me interested."
koreanvariety,39w84b,stephenantonio,2,Mon Jun 15 12:27:53 2015 UTC,"I agree with you, and from what I've noticed, most of the older(mature?) WGM couples are more interesting to watch (IMO), Yoon Han & Lee So-yeon , Namgung Min & Hong Jin-young etc."
koreanvariety,39w84b,Hitokiri2,1 point,Mon Jun 15 13:28:37 2015 UTC,I agree. When couples first start out I usually like the younger couples but as the relationships go on I like the older/more mature couples. I think it's because the younger couples remind me of myself when I was first dating and the older couples remind me of now as I settle down with my gf who is soon to be my wife.  The Solim couple was interesting in the beginning but later it just seemed like a game to them and that's okay but that turned me off. Henry and Yewon was interesting but right when it was getting interesting unfortunately WGM decided to pull the plug on them.   My girlfriend is really look forward to the Sungjae/Joy couple while I'm looking forward to the Minseok/Yewon couple. Should be good and I hope the ratings go up because of these changes.
koreanvariety,39w84b,Kairoro,8,Mon Jun 15 18:11:19 2015 UTC,"Personally I think it's a huge shame for Hewon couple to end so soon. I know that it's a Korean TV show but it was nice to see some of the western romance and 'forwardness', and how the Korean partner dealt with it.   As for Solim, I really enjoyed their earlier segments and their trip to Turkey was enjoyable but personally I found Soeun to hold back near the later episodes when Jaerim was being forward which put some doubts in my mind about it all. It was a very emotional last episode, one of the best I've seen yet.  Super stoked for Sungjae x Joy.  Not too fussed about the older couple but I'll watch it to see how it goes, the preview seemed pretty good!"
koreanvariety,39w84b,secretgardenme,2,Mon Jun 15 09:53:13 2015 UTC,"To me, JaeRim couple seemed to most comfortable and most realistic with their chemistry. They fought, they played, they flirted and I loved every moment of it.   It is interesting because I view Hewon opposite of you. I was really excited for them after the first two episodes where it did seem like Henry was just very high energy and forward. But I stopped watching that couple after the next few episodes because Henry seemed to just be really pervy and Yewon was in a situation where she couldn't really refuse because she was just happy to still be on the show. It was just really cringey and uncomfortable to watch for me."
koreanvariety,39w84b,Kairoro,1 point,Mon Jun 15 16:10:41 2015 UTC,I guess its how you perceive their 'marriage'.  Henry wasn't doing anything out of the ordinary in my opinion but we all know he's a big flirt!
koreanvariety,39w84b,secretgardenme,1 point,Mon Jun 15 20:49:00 2015 UTC,but we all know he's a big flirt pervert!   Fixed that for you. This wouldn't be the first show where he did some extremely questionable things around women. He has been in Korea almost a decade now. He is only 25 so that is a massive chunk of his life. At a certain point you can't shield him as just being foreign or coming from a different culture. He has been in Korea long enough that he knows exactly how he is acting.
koreanvariety,39w84b,dattroll123,2,Tue Jun 16 04:01:15 2015 UTC,"Personally I think it's a huge shame for Hewon couple to end so soon. I know that it's a Korean TV show but it was nice to see some of the western romance and 'forwardness', and how the Korean partner dealt with it.   I completely agree with you, it's interesting to see how different people growing up from slightly difference culture handle the other being in a relationship.   As for Solim, I really enjoyed their earlier segments and their trip to Turkey was enjoyable but personally I found Soeun to hold back near the later episodes when Jaerim was being forward which put some doubts in my mind about it all. It was a very emotional last episode, one of the best I've seen yet.   I also sometimes notice the one sided affection too, JaeRim is more open about his feelings while SoEun not so much. I think it's a first where the guy cried first right? (I may be wrong) Nevertheless, it really was a touching ending.    Super stoked for Sungjae x Joy. Not too fussed about the older couple but I'll watch it to see how it goes, the preview seemed pretty good!   I personally never really do get attached to idols's WGM, don't know why. I'm more towards older couples / actor actress (Namgung Min & Hong Jin-young , Song Jae-rim & Kim So-eun , Yoon Han & Lee So-yeon, Jung Joon-young & Jeong Yu-mi, Jang Wooyoung & Park Se-young etc), but that's just my opinion. :)"
koreanvariety,39w84b,furyswipesoflove,2,Mon Jun 15 11:56:06 2015 UTC,this is why I want to see a Henry + Amber couple. They would behave quite differently.  Plus Henry kinda got shafted because the producers made Yewon the scapegoat.

Also, Sorim best couple. Not gonna lie I've watched a lot of WGM and they are by far my fave couple to date. They were fun and really grew together and I really would've liked to see that 50 year WGM.   Conversely, I never liked Henry's character in any of the other shows and Yewon always seemed very fake to me from when I first saw her in Invincible Youth 2. I always skipped their part when watching so I don't have much input."

koreanvariety,39tqic,AIGOOOMONA,3,Sun Jun 14 18:25:58 2015 UTC,"Happy Together needs to kick Jo Se Ho. That guy is simply unfunny and ruining all the shows he goes on. I wish they could bring back the 2 gagmen. I usually admire people who puts efforts in a show, but Jo Se Ho is just greedy for air time, keep on cutting guests inappropriately, tries to MC when there is YJS trying to control the flow and always talks bout his fake stories. Like its not even funny. I stopped watching Roommate when it started to focus on him, and I stopped watching Happy Together despite loving the show. I can't even watch it when my favorite guests are on because he is just so annoying to watch. He is a gagman, I have no idea why he keeps thinking he is going to be the next national MC when he has no substance, knowledge and sensitivity to guests. He just tries to make drama and forced material."

koreanvariety,39p1t2,Renxification,1 point,Sat Jun 13 15:52:36 2015 UTC,"I've been watching a few episodes here and there, and was wondering - is there a set number of tone-deaf contestants and skilled vocalist contestants each episode? Or does it vary? (e.g. ep 7 has 3 tone deaf and 4 skilled but ep 10 has 2 tone deaf and 5 skilled, or is it always 4 skilled, 3 tone deaf?)"
koreanvariety,39p1t2,bbaek,1 point,Sat Jun 13 17:43:46 2015 UTC,My guess it depends on how many audition. Not everyone is willing to embarrass themselves on television nowadays since it can be shared and tweeted when the episode is online.
koreanvariety,39pumv,zhu_,2,Sat Jun 13 16:16:40 2015 UTC,"The most similar show I know of is A Style For You, which is also a style show with a group of fun MCs where they go to various cool shops / eateries around Seoul. However lots of the running time is kinda wasted on ""trend information"" from around the world which is somewhat boring, also the PDs on Style Log did a much better job scouting interesting locations and bringing Seoul to life as it were. On the other hand I think the cast interactions on ASFU are more fun, Heechul is a way better MC than anyone on Style Log and he really keeps the show moving plus adds a lot of humour."

koreanvariety,39o8dd,onemorelight,7,Sat Jun 13 04:38:27 2015 UTC,I'm getting really excited for the new season. I wonder if Dongmin truly wants to work with Hyunmin - and I think it's right for Hyunmin to hold back and branch out with new collaborators.
koreanvariety,39o8dd,KnivesMillions,4,Sat Jun 13 04:42:56 2015 UTC,"I think it would be the best strategy in general, since they can trust each other fully. But I'm guessing Hyunmin doesn't want to for other reasons, its not like he's being used but it kinda feels that way imo."
koreanvariety,39o8dd,sibtoa,6,Sat Jun 13 04:57:25 2015 UTC,I think Hyunmin will be reluctant to work with DM this season. I think HM wants to prove himself in a way.
koreanvariety,39o8dd,eIworld,1 point,Sat Jun 13 09:16:52 2015 UTC,"I can see that happen , especialy if he has any pre-game alliance ."
koreanvariety,39o8dd,kyugi0923,6,Sat Jun 13 13:27:05 2015 UTC,"Hyunmin probably is one of, if not the best, strategical mind out of the group probably rivaled by Jin Ho and Yo Hwan. However, I think that his play is too aggressive in that if he is in alliance and he sees that there is a method to be the final winner that he would derail his alliance's plan just so he can be the winner of that round. The reason this is bad is that whoever Hyunmin works with can't fully trust him and instead they can decide to betray him if they feel like they're getting played by Hyunmin. The reason that Hyunmin made such a great team with Dong Min is that Dong Min has that natural leader persona and can rally a team together even though he may not have the best strategical mind out of everyone. With Hyunmin's natural strategical mind and Dong Min's natural leadership abilities, they become one deadly team.  I often compared Hyunmin's play with Jin Ho's play. While both strategical, Jin Ho in a team game is more willing to give up being the winner just as long as one of his teammates wins in the end. This makes Jin Ho a good ally to have since he wouldn't really betray you for his own good. Jin Ho has a strategical mind like Hyunmin, but people feel they can work with him more since he can be more of a team player. It would be great to see how these two work/fight with each other.  Although in the end even though I'm rooting for Jin Ho or Hyunmin to win, I think that Sangmin probably has the highest chance of winning LOL"
koreanvariety,39o8dd,KnivesMillions,5,Sat Jun 13 18:40:20 2015 UTC,"I think that Sangmin probably has the highest chance of winning LOL   I think the otherway around, I want Sangmin to win but he's usually teaming up and manipulating others in the background but now that these are all pretty much all-stars they won't be as easy to manipulate around, and they all have the minds to go against Sangmin easily. To mee Sangmin feels a king without a kingdom to rule because on this season there are very few people he could rule over."
koreanvariety,39o8dd,concreteroads,3,Sat Jun 13 21:47:35 2015 UTC,"I think Sang-min, like Sunggyu in season one, has approximately the survival skill of a cockroach hahah.  The players in S4 are definitely much wiser to his tricks, but I was surprised in S2 and honestly, even later in S1, that Sang-min was never picked for a death match or even garnered any serious enemies. There was never a shortage of players who would willingly ally with him, and I don't think that's going to change even in the all-star season."
koreanvariety,39o8dd,kyugi0923,3,Sun Jun 14 02:20:50 2015 UTC,"From what I remember from the previous seasons, the games are designed so that betraying others won't make you an easy target for the elimination game. The reason I say this is because some of the elimination games are specifically designed so that your success is decided by the other players. One example is the Rock Paper Scissor game. Now let's say you were betrayed by Sangmin and you had the chance to choose him for an elimination game, would you actually choose him knowing full well that he will have the support of the winning team? In a scenario were the players are divided into equal teams, the winning team will have a much bigger influence to the elimination game. If you choose Sangmin, then you're forced to bet that your elimination game isn't like the Rock-Paper-Scissor game. Choosing Sangmin would be too risky of a play."
koreanvariety,39o8dd,concreteroads,1 point,Sun Jun 14 05:11:13 2015 UTC,"What you said is definitely true!  I think part of it is still fear though, lol. Pretty sure half of season 1 was terrified of Kim Gura/Lee Sang-min. Kyung-ran too, which is why the scary noona never made it into a death match either until the end.   Versus unable-to-be-heartless Jin-ho, or someone like Cha Yu-ram, who got picked half a dozen times."
koreanvariety,39o8dd,kyugi0923,2,Sun Jun 14 05:57:13 2015 UTC,Yeah one of the flaws with the show is when elders or someone of stature are part of the game because Asian culture places a heavy emphasis of respecting them and so players have to act around them since they don't want to upset them.
koreanvariety,39o8dd,concreteroads,3,Sun Jun 14 06:09:21 2015 UTC,"For sure, culture definitely plays a big role when the players are making alliances and deciding who to work with and stuff like that. So you see incidents like in Season 1 after Kim Gura was eliminated early, where they all ganged up on Jin-ho and Poong the following episode. Originally that really rubbed me the wrong way, because I was like... Gura treated most of you like crap, plus he was a top contender. Wouldn't you want him gone? But their overreaction makes more sense when you consider that he's a huge broadcasting hyung and a lot of them do work in that industry. And so it also makes sense that it was two non-celebrities who dared to pick him for death match.   I think that luckily there is a good mix of contestants who studied and lived abroad though, so the atmosphere of the show can be a blend of individualistic and collectivistic competition."
koreanvariety,39o8dd,KnivesMillions,1 point,Sun Jun 14 14:45:56 2015 UTC,"Holy shit man I had completely forgotten about Sunggyu, he was so good, jesus why didn't they bring him back, he was like the Hyunmin to Dongmin of Sangmin (wat) that would've led to some nice teaming up and Sunggyu was pretty much like the ""teacher"" can't remember his name that was on last season, starts out weak and dumb and ends up being real threat."
koreanvariety,39o8dd,concreteroads,3,Sun Jun 14 02:24:12 2015 UTC,"Haha I liked Sunggyu in season 1 and all... but man for a kid and an idol he's scary as hell. I think as a player I'd be more afraid of him than Sang-min or Hyun-min, because Sunggyu works that aegyo like nobody else's business, enough that they somehow managed to forget every week that he's a total threat. (Remember his ""noona~"" calls that had all the girls melting into puddles at his feet?)"
koreanvariety,39o8dd,srkambbs1,2,Sun Jun 14 02:41:51 2015 UTC,"Ever since I saw the first shortlist for the cast, I wish Sunggyu were on this season. My guess is that he's too busy to commit to the whole season filming, what with his solo promotions (just ended) and Infinite stuff coming up. He totally deserves to be called an ""all-star"" over, well, Jungmoon, for example."

From both showing their father side, to Doto and his wound and how he was suffering (even the ostriches were polite haha), to the parting time when the elephants clearly understood that they were leaving and didn't want them to go. All of it was just really good and almost moved me to tears. Sometimes its easy to forget how intelligent these animals are."

Though I will give this one a try simply because of Yoon Jong Shin. I fucking loved the dude in Family Outing, when him and Yoo Jae Suk would bicker and banter to me it was hella funny. Hope this new cast does well."

koreanvariety,39kz4f,themadbat,4,Fri Jun 12 13:35:07 2015 UTC,"I used to watch all the episodes when I was young. The following list is from my memory so it's no means complete but has most of the ""regulars"":  Lee Sang In, Go Soo, Jo Sung Mo, god, Kim Sung Soo, Kim Jong Kook, Lim Chang Jung, Yoo Seung Jin, Rain, Lee Jihoon.  Most of the time, the guests on Dream Team were athletic or hilarious (Yoo Jaesuk came on once and I remember he was eliminated quickly). I think they refer to Rain coming on Dream Team because I feel like that's how he became so popular. I still remember his first episode where he was such a shy newcomer to the scene. The other episode that lasts in my memory was when they took all the best competitors and had a multi-round elimination game that tested their strength, speed, reflexes, jumping, etc. I doubted Kim Jong kook at that point to have the speed to finish in first but he proved me very wrong and took first overall over all of the regulars."

The only variety shows still available from about 12 to 15 years ago seems to be X-Man ( this is only from my brief knowledge).   To OP, Hong Seokcheon (the chef) was also a part of the original line up. He was apparently a very athletic participant. He's absolutely hilarious as well."

koreanvariety,39kz4f,saramdapgae,3,Fri Jun 12 22:34:51 2015 UTC,Junjin was honestly the best performer in the old Dream Team. He practically destroyed even the professionals whenever he appeared on Dream Team. He also brought in the fans as well as visibility for the Dream Team programme.
koreanvariety,39kz4f,femacca,2,Sun Jun 14 14:33:39 2015 UTC,He also won a best of the best Dream Team competition 3 days after sustaining a major head injury and being in a coma. He was insane.

koreanvariety,39kz4f,Oat-,2,Fri Jun 12 13:58:52 2015 UTC,"I don't know, but I'm also really interested in Dream Team. The newer episodes are on KBS YouTube channel, but it's very hard to learn anything about the show's history. It seems like it has been airing for a very long time, but isn't very popular now. The way it's filmed and edited I get the feeling they keep it on the air for the sake of tradition.  The thing is, the show is really good sometimes! I love the idol Ssireum wrestling every year (Crayon Pop!). I like the flag race. Celebrity athletic competitions are fun! But now there are even cooking episodes? Yeah, I can ignore those."

koreanvariety,39k3cb,deoxix,0,Fri Jun 12 14:43:52 2015 UTC,"The subname of the season is: ""Grand Final"" so it's pretty clear. I prefer them to die on their peak than to die repeating more games for years."
koreanvariety,39hu16,Hitokiri2,10,Thu Jun 11 20:32:24 2015 UTC,"As much fun as I like watching Kim Jong Kook being teased with Yoon Eun hye, it seems to me they both do want to leave it behind and let it be past.   Yoon Eun Hye actively avoids Running Man because she doesn't want to be on as Jong Kook's love interest. She mentioned she doesn't mind being a regular guest though."
koreanvariety,39hu16,alastoris,3,Fri Jun 12 00:20:13 2015 UTC,"The sad part is that even if she does go on the show and they avoid mentioning their past love line, there would be a huge backlash from certain fans."
koreanvariety,39hu16,i_4got,3,Fri Jun 12 02:42:16 2015 UTC,"I suspect this is also why former couple in WGM does not keep in contact even as normal friends (or show to stay in touch). They do not want to feed the fans that ships them by giving them a harsh reality of ""This is over!"""
koreanvariety,39hu16,alastoris,3,Fri Jun 12 03:00:59 2015 UTC,"Judging by the fact that there are still Khuntoria shippers out there, I'd say this is a good point."
koreanvariety,39hu16,i_4got,2,Fri Jun 12 04:03:50 2015 UTC,"I agree. In fact, it's quite amazing that Jo Kwon and Gain went on Happy Together recently."
koreanvariety,39hu16,_Dantes_Inporno_,3,Sat Jun 13 00:14:42 2015 UTC,I agree.  Love lines have been resolved on shows before. Lee Hyori and Park Yejin (who also did a video with KJK and was on the show 3-4 times) were also in love lines KJK. Even old rumors like Yoo Jaesuk and Yoo Jung were cleared I feel purposely on Running Man.   In Korean variety shows the quickest way to get rid of dating rumors and such is to show up together and just deny it. Amber and Henry did it. Many WGM couples have done it and it works for them. Even Young Ji and Jackson Wang did the same thing with Weekly Idol and various radio interviews and people saw they were just friends.   Most people are smart enough to figure out that it's fake but people just like to ship couples. I can understand why they still wouldn't like to show up on the same show but not showing up on the same show isn't helping them either. :p
koreanvariety,39hu16,DFu4ever,6,Fri Jun 12 03:02:19 2015 UTC,"There is nothing sad about it.  To Running Man fans, that is ALL she is known for.  Having her on and avoiding it would be a terrible choice.  Avoiding it would be the most intensely awkward thing they could do.  Can you imagine watching a whole episode where it's abundantly clear that the entire cast has to watch what they say for fear of bringing up the pink elephant in the room?  It would have to be one of the most overproduced episodes of the show to date, simply to distract the viewer and keep the members out of positions where it would be obvious to bring it up."
koreanvariety,39hu16,i_4got,4,Fri Jun 12 04:05:05 2015 UTC,"To Running Man fans, that is ALL she is known for   That's what's sad about it. The fact that she's an accomplished actress, but all viewers want to see is them talk about a love line from 10 years ago."
koreanvariety,39hu16,DFu4ever,6,Fri Jun 12 04:34:15 2015 UTC,"That's how she is relevant to this specific show, though.  I'm not knocking her talents, but her connection to a cast member on this show is more interesting to most fans of the show (not her...the show) than her career, even if only for the comedy value.  And the thing is, more people would likely find out about her if she came on the show.  Right now she's the girl that refuses to do the show because people want her to do the show for non-career related reasons.  Well, yeah.  Celebs may appear on the show to promote themselves or a current project, but people don't watch the show to see them do that."
koreanvariety,39hu16,DFu4ever,6,Fri Jun 12 04:39:23 2015 UTC,"Agree. Next week we're going to see two of Lee Kwang Soo's best friends and Haha's wife Byul. Anyone who follows the Running Man cast knows who these people are but I bet you they're just as famous for who their friend is then what they actually do for a career.   I would challenge ANYONE from on top of their heads to name one song Byul has sung in the past 5 years or name 2 or more movies or dramas Jo Insung has been in his career.   These people are just a part of the lives of the cast of Running Man and people would love to see them on Running Man. This is the same for anyone who as teamed up with Yoo Jaesuk in the past, anyone who has acted along side with Song Jihyo, and let's not forget they just had a ""best friends"" episode for Ji Sukjin.   So to bring in people connected to the cast is nothing new and it actually helps the shows and brings up ratings. Heck..haha..and I know that KJK is kidding about this (I think).

koreanvariety,39hu16,DFu4ever,1 point,Fri Jun 12 05:03:47 2015 UTC,If it was officially announced that GaryxJihyo was real I'm fairly sure the global Runningman fandom would have an emotional free for all
koreanvariety,39hu16,SarcasticSarcophagus,2,Sun Jun 14 15:15:54 2015 UTC,I think the Monday Couple well always follow Gary and Ji Hyo much like how the fake love line have followed KJK and YEH.
koreanvariety,39hu16,tronatula,1 point,Sun Jun 14 23:48:58 2015 UTC,Very likely. Especially since they already made a cameo scene in Jihyo's Emergency Couple for fan service.
koreanvariety,39hu16,sfoura,3,Mon Jun 15 01:21:22 2015 UTC,"If they ever want it to go away, then she needs to come on and just embrace the humor in the situation.  Don't pretend it's still a loveline, but don't dodge the fact that in Running Man mythology, she's HUGE.  The episode has to find some way to make that part of the theme, and make it hilarious.  She's the biggest star they've never had, solely because of the stuff that happened years ago.  Just make an episode that feels like some sort of comedic payoff and there you go.  The worst thing to do would be to have her on and ignore it entirely.  It'd just be better to never have her on, because that episode would be a disaster."
koreanvariety,39hu16,Isketam,3,Fri Jun 12 04:00:16 2015 UTC,I was about to make a video like this but found out it already existed on Youtube. I love the Yoo Eun Hye/KJK references since I was a fan of this couple during the X-man year as well. So funny and I hope that one day Yoo Eun Hye does come on the show. It would be an awesome.

If they had a short segment or something I think it would be better (like how Sistar was there for like 10 minutes and EXO just did the name tag race), but I don't think they're suited for a special."

koreanvariety,39hvd3,Warlord_X,20,Thu Jun 11 20:49:58 2015 UTC,"Forget the location, blame the people who were playing in such a dangerous place. Plus who plays Running Man with FORTY (!!!!) people?   I've play Running Man with my friends before and the most people we had was 10 or 12. Plus we played it in a safe place where we knew the boundaries to our play area. The elevator shaft was obviously not barred off."
koreanvariety,39hvd3,Hitokiri2,11,Fri Jun 12 02:06:28 2015 UTC,"As if the same tragic accident hadn't happened, if they just had played hide-and-go-seek or cops & robbers in the abandoned industrial building instead of the name tag game. How about you don't go into abandoned industrial buildings to play anything? I'd go as far as to say that those people who first tried to put any sort of blame or responsibility on the Korean or Chinese version of Running Man must have had some sort of ulterior malicious motive (for example, they don't like the Korean/foreign influence on their media and thought this was a good way to turn public opinion against it or something), it simply doesn't make sense to connect these things otherwise."
koreanvariety,39hvd3,NowBiggerAndBetter,18,Fri Jun 12 00:38:14 2015 UTC,"Uh, falled down an elevator shaft? How many years old was he to not know he shouldn't be jumping into holes? He didn't fall he was pushed into it. This is foul play or maybe me watching too much crime scene.   But seriously, they can't really ask responsibility from the show as they always play in safe spaces (offices, public spaces...) and they don't have anything to do with the lack of protection from the child parents. It would really take the cake if they have now to put a message of ""don't try this without parent supervision"" like what a tv show do when doing dangerous stuff because people can be really idiotic."
koreanvariety,39hvd3,deoxix,9,Thu Jun 11 21:13:29 2015 UTC,"That reminded me of The Simpsons when Homer says: ""now they put a warning because of me""."
koreanvariety,39hvd3,heil_pritz,3,Thu Jun 11 21:29:10 2015 UTC,"The sad thing is, Running Man already puts a message of ""don't try this at home"" or ""this was filmed safely with the cooperation of xxx organization"" oftentimes in their episodes when they're filming on locations....   While the student's death is really tragic and I feel for his/her family, it's also deeply unfortunate that 40 high school aged, supposedly free thinking and reasonably mature teenagers, couldn't use their common sense and better judgement in playing the game."
koreanvariety,39hvd3,concreteroads,7,Fri Jun 12 14:18:24 2015 UTC,"Obviously blaming Running Man is ridiculous based solely on the fact that Running Man did not create 'tag/touch' style games.  They've probably existed for thousands of years.  Hell, kids play them all the time.  The lesson to be learned here is to not play games in a dangerous environment.  Also...shit happens."

koreanvariety,39hlgp,femacca,3,Thu Jun 11 19:40:41 2015 UTC,The person everyone wants to eliminate but afraid to come face-to-face with. I am dying to see a showdown between him and Hyunmin. Slightly stubborn in his own way - would rather play alone if he finds himself not able to work well with others - but easy-going otherwise.
koreanvariety,39hlgp,femacca,37,Fri Jun 12 01:45:34 2015 UTC,Jang Dongmin
koreanvariety,39hlgp,femacca,7,Thu Jun 11 19:41:14 2015 UTC,"It will be more difficult for him this time around as the reigning champion, as he was more like an underdog when S3 first started due to his gagman personality. His strengths lie in sizing people up quickly. I rate his psychological play as possibly higher than Sangmin, but he is domineering and takes too much risk. He's like a general who prefers to lead troops to the battlefield personally, whereas Sangmin tends to remain in the background to give instructions."
koreanvariety,39hlgp,sibtoa,10,Fri Jun 12 01:52:59 2015 UTC,"I think Sangmin is MUCH more shrewd than Dongmin.  Season 2 was absolutely controlled by Sangmin.  No one could touch him, made it to the finale without going to a single deathmatch (he is the only one to do this).  Dongmin was a little sloppy in his control, but none the less, running the show.  I don't know if you watch Survivor, but a good analogy is that Dongmin is a little like Cagayan Tony, while Sangmin is a Kim Spradlin, or RI Boston Rob."
koreanvariety,39hlgp,concreteroads,2,Fri Jun 12 02:06:13 2015 UTC,"I rated Dongmin higher because I thought he sized up people fast and worked the psychological traits into his game strategising. Sangmin was slower when it comes to grasping game concepts and formulating gameplay but better at manipulating people for deeds that benefit him yet doesn't dirty his own hands in the process - as a Chinese idiom goes, ""murder with a borrowed knife"" (I don't know if there's an English equivalent for it?).   Sangmin's loyalty lies only in what benefits him, so he is certainly more ruthless. Dongmin's loyalty lies with people who work with him, and a bit of this rubbed off Hyunmin in S3. Not necessarily a good trait in TG b/c it makes one more vulnerable by subjecting one to consider for others at the possible expense of oneself."
koreanvariety,39hlgp,Animostas,1 point,Fri Jun 12 03:52:22 2015 UTC,"I like him the most because he's a leader style which I lack. However, his play is very risky because for example, bomb episode he push hyumin to the top and risk himself and his team trusting that hyumin will give him immunity. So what if a person he trusted betrayed him? I think he give his team a lot of trust but it's like a double edge sword. Still I like to see people trusting each other just like ""nao""in the liar game manga, it's a game of trust."
koreanvariety,39hlgp,dreamraine,1 point,Fri Jun 12 07:25:41 2015 UTC,"I totally agree with the way you've compared Sang-min and Dong-min! :) While I did end up liking them both, Sang-min is absolutely more ruthless, like the sneaky advisor in the shadows who (literally, if we look at S1E4) controls the puppet king. Dong-min is more of the jovial, front-line leader. Your general leading troops into war analogy is perfect. Sang-min managed to avoid death matches for the entire first season because hardly anyone realized just how terrifying he was until after the episodes starting airing.   I think you're right, Dong-min is more loyal in a sense, which makes him just a shade too trusting for The Genius. But I think this can also be a saving factor, the same way Hong Jin-ho won Season 1 partially by always being honest in and about his alliances."
koreanvariety,39hlgp,femacca,1 point,Sat Jun 13 12:33:44 2015 UTC,I think that just came from Sangmin getting the protection thingy. It sort of broke the game.
koreanvariety,39hlgp,femacca,2,Sun Jun 14 23:15:03 2015 UTC,"Jang Dongmin has that leader style but he also has the hidden card of having a photographic memory...too bad it's not so hidden now, and it doesn't work when he's tired."
koreanvariety,39hlgp,concreteroads,37,Fri Jun 12 13:10:49 2015 UTC,Oh Hyunmin
koreanvariety,39hlgp,Thetwinmasters,4,Thu Jun 11 19:41:23 2015 UTC,Has a higher chance this time around as he would have learned from his shortcomings from S3. Would do even better if he is less emotional but that will come with age and life experience.
koreanvariety,39hlgp,KnivesMillions,20,Fri Jun 12 01:41:52 2015 UTC,Kim Kyungran
koreanvariety,39hlgp,Delfish,5,Thu Jun 11 19:40:50 2015 UTC,"She is the best female performer in all 3 seasons. However, her strengths lie more in charisma, control and persuasion. She is not as impressive when the games require more complex thinking and strategising, like the Horse Races."
koreanvariety,39hlgp,concreteroads,3,Fri Jun 12 01:27:53 2015 UTC,"Agree, I loved Kyung-ran! I thought she was an exceptional peoples person and leader, nearly on par with the well-known members such as Jang Dong-min. She was already a huge underdog once--I don't think anybody expected her to take down Lee Sang-min and make it to the top 2--and yet I think she'll still be the underdog in S4.  Sad truth: women are clearly underestimated in this show, and while sometimes that's a good thing, sometimes that leads to a terrible self-fulfilling prophecy, like with Ha Yeon-joo."
koreanvariety,39hlgp,spritorac,1 point,Sat Jun 13 12:36:07 2015 UTC,"I remember her always being horrible at the horse races too, but I think its funny that for both of the races, she somehow stumbled her way to victory (her guest helped one time)."

koreanvariety,39hlgp,KnivesMillions,1 point,Fri Jun 12 04:28:48 2015 UTC,"Never really liked him in season 1, then season 2 affirmed my stand further. He's extremely scheming and often manipulates people to his own advantage."
koreanvariety,39hlgp,Pixel64,3,Sat Jun 13 16:35:22 2015 UTC,"I thought he was likeable in Season 1! Season 2 he went a bit too far with the scheming, but in the first season I thought he played with a definite ruthless and mercenary streak, yet also had a clear guiding moral compass/his own rules to play by. Like if someone accidentally suffered because of something he unintentionally did (e.g. when Cha Yuram came dead last because Sang-min gave her the wrong tip), he'd always make amends after and save them.   Also he had some surprisingly cute moments in season 1. I think Sunggyu was a good influence, and Jinho and Kyungran did a good job of keeping him in check. His outfit showcase in the openings were hilarious, and some of my favourite moments of the entire season involved the few times Sang-min got super anxious and ran around like a chicken with its head cut off (Zombie Game, when he drank spit haha, and his final episode, where he went the super shameless route and started feeling up some of the male guests to see what they were wearing)."

koreanvariety,39hlgp,concreteroads,8,Thu Jun 11 19:42:24 2015 UTC,"My absolute favorite character, the highlight of the second season.  His story arc is like no other, going from the confused old man who does not understand the food chain game to the back to back to back death match winner (a feat only accomplished by him and Jinho) who was just one win shy of the finale.  Also he's hilarious."

koreanvariety,398y73,natcookie,3,Wed Jun 10 09:19:20 2015 UTC,I am very very excited for next week's episode
koreanvariety,398y73,SarcasticSarcophagus,-2,Wed Jun 10 05:12:00 2015 UTC,This was a good one. Seems that without Yu PD at the helm this week they're finally reworking the games a bit and going back to it's roots. I'm getting tired of quizzes and prefer the physical   Lately the show has been going downhill with episodes like The second cooking special and SNU Class of 2019. National Treasure Trip was also underwhelming. Here's hoping that next week's starlet filled special has that spark that's been missing lately.
koreanvariety,398y73,I_Plunder_Booty,7,Wed Jun 10 05:43:36 2015 UTC,"isn't most of this stuff planned ahead of time though, like prior to the recording? so i'd imagine yu pd simply left behind the script for his junior pd  anyways this was a great episode! couldn't stop laughing at junho during the ssireum part"
koreanvariety,398y73,I_Plunder_Booty,-2,Wed Jun 10 06:29:19 2015 UTC,"Considering that the show is taped every 2 weeks year round I doub't they plan too much ahead. I bet it's closer to southpark's style of production, where a show is done start to finish in a week. They may have a general outline of what they want to do for the year, but I doubt they have much idea as to any specifics more then a week or 2 in advance. In season 1 Kim Jungmin went on a scouting trip with the crew for their next shoot, the trip was a week before the actual show's filming. There are also countless moments throughout the shows history that show there is not as much forethought and planning as in other TV shows, and that isn't a bad thing, it works with 1 day 2 nights. That being said I think the current PD has a whole lot to do with the content of the weeks show. And my statement that Yu PD's games and themes have gotten kind of stale still stands. He's great at the us/vs them psychological torture aspect of the show but his bokbulgok is weak."
koreanvariety,39b3eb,HealerKeeper,5,Wed Jun 10 15:34:29 2015 UTC,"On SBS's Good Sunday website, they list November 11, 2007 as episode #1. Using that numbering system, this past Sunday was the Good Sunday's 382nd episode.   November 11, 2007 was when they re-organized the show from one stand-alone program of 70 minutes to three programs splitting 150 minutes. So older shows like X-Man aren't part of Good Sunday in SBS's categorization/whatever.  Daum follows SBS's convention. However, Naver, Wikipedia (Korean and English), and many, many sources list March 28, 2004 as the starting date because that's when they actually started using the ""Good Sunday"" moniker."

It's not my favorite drama of all time, but it's very watchable, and is definitely pushing some boundaries."

koreanvariety,3927ic,Isketam,3,Tue Jun 9 11:31:09 2015 UTC,"The racing is extremely dry and this comes from a guy who loves his racing. It stems from Korean variety editors wanting to show the same scene from seven different angles, then show everyone's reaction, then show it from more angles, then show the impact happening two times, and then the dust settles. I'd go into this series of episodes wanting to see the cast interaction and not the challenge and I recommend anyone interested to do the same.   Wheel-to-wheel racing is fantastic because it happens once, you see it on the television, you see it on replay, and then we're straight back to the action. It's not the same for anything sports related in Korean variety. With that said, again, don't go into this series expecting to see some thrilling racing - watch it for the guys having a bit of fun!"

koreanvariety,3927ic,iscreamsoda,3,Mon Jun 8 23:01:29 2015 UTC,"I thought the panties thing was one of the funniest things I've ever seen. I like when idol groups like Shinwa, 2ne1, Z:EA or them (or whoever came with their entire group, but I can only think of them) come on because they all have good chemistry with each other as do RM members have with each other, makes it seem more fair instead of having a shit ton of random guests who don't really know each other.  I dunno, that's just my preference when guests come in general. Like when Law of the Jungle's cast came, I thought that was pretty sweet."

koreanvariety,3927ic,BrandCAG,2,Tue Jun 9 08:20:33 2015 UTC,"I actually really enjoyed this episode, I found the last race to be really thrilling and exciting! The games before were okay but there were some great moments like Taeyang on the gear and getting stripped during basketball. Haha I actually felt pretty bad for Kim Jongkook when he got stripped. I wish there were some Dumb & Dumber moments between Jaesuk and Daesung (I loved Family Outing) but since they were on different teams that was a little harder. I also wish Seungri talked a little more, the first episode he ever filmed with Running Man alone is one of my favorite episodes of all time. But GD was great too and it was really funny to see him get dirty since he is usually obsessed with being clean."
koreanvariety,3927ic,BrandCAG,3,Fri Jun 12 02:47:42 2015 UTC,"Idk if it was the concept or the games or if the Bigbang members were just exhausted from doing current promotions, but this episode was quite uneventful for me. None of them really stood out except for maybe several moments for Daesung.     The water basketball was probably the most entertaining part; the thing with Jongkook was funny, although it got a bit uncomfortable when spoiler. I know similar occurrences have happened to other RM members in the past (notably Kwangsoo and Gary), but my complaint about it stems from how long that joke went on. It looked like Jongkook took it all in good stride at the end, but I felt bad for him when they left him ""crying"" to himself in the water and continued playing around him. It was honestly one of those moments where I didn't know whether to laugh or cringe at the situation lol."
koreanvariety,3927ic,BrandCAG,0,Tue Jun 9 16:39:44 2015 UTC,"There's point that it will be all right if KJK doesn't care and accept it because they are close enough. However, the most important problem is not how KJK took it, it's the how the viewers think and the show's image/reputation. Not all the viewers know that the members are close and KJK is all right with it. And how RM broadcasted that without edits and even posting the video at their official Youtube channel shows they aren't aware what the problem is about.   It's more inexcusable because that happened before at Ep. 38 and they went through a lot of criticisms and troubles because of that. RM currently is stereotyped as a ""childish show which only elementary schoolers and foreigners are interested to watch"" by their haters at Korea, so what happened at here doesn't help with that image either.  I just don't like how the minigames became nothing but time fillers and highlights for body gags where everything is pushed aside to be ""funny."" And they give out wins to whoever is in the script to win or whoever they think needs it. Sadly, this basketball minigame is that side of the show and they really went out of limits."

Kwang Soo was treated really bad and was humilliated many times worst than that the last 5 years.  Many other naked scenes on RM:  Episode 105- Jae Suk Opens the bathroom door and kwang soo is naked in the shower.  Episode 118 - Ji Suk Jin was almost naked  Episode 189 - Haha shows Gary sleeping naked  Episode 151 - Kwang Soo rubber boxer  Episode 118 - Kwang soo was naked from top  and many others..."

koreanvariety,3927ic,Trn4mr,-12,Tue Jun 9 08:43:51 2015 UTC,"The first part when the casts pulled KJK's and Taeyang's pants are still 'tolerable' for me but not the second part when LKS did it.  As for LKS getting the same treatment, he's a maknae in the show so all the jokes and pranks on him are borderline funny.  But when he did it to his hyungs (more like overdid and overeacting) that's when it stops being funny to the point it's considered rude. I don't think even the Korean viewers find it funny at all.  Back in episode 248 when LKS put those ball in team Gary basket .. look how pissed Gary was.  Even SJH called him 'pabo' for overdoing it after the mission. Luckily Gary and LKS are back in good terms with each other at the end of the episode."

koreanvariety,3927ic,JunYiDeWorld,-4,Tue Jun 9 01:41:04 2015 UTC,I'm more towards SJH fan :)  Yes it's a variety show but certain pranks or jokes has its limits. My point here is LKS overdid it. Others might did the same pranks in old episodes but not to this extent.  Stripping someone naked on camera? How's that even considered as funny?

I mean, I don't really know how close their relationships actually are in real life but if someone who was like a brother to me pulled the same prank on me, I probably wouldn't be able to stay mad at them forever.

Thank you soooo much, i'm on the verge going crazy trying to find that ep.   I do vaguely remember it was on mini games quiz on water/pool, but mistakenly with ep 31. So i checked , and the boom mic didn't even have the fur, so i doubt my memory.   Then i thinking, maybe it was during the cat cafe mini games, so i check ep 99, but they use the usual wireless mic on their body.   How do you remember that ep ? I'm shame to say i don't even remember Jung Jun Ha was on the same ep when that cute moment happen. It should be a dead giveaway :("
koreanvariety,394129,amelisa28,3,Tue Jun 9 03:53:55 2015 UTC,"But just to add, I am curious if there was another moment in the earlier episodes with a chair since the dialogue in the YouTube video had been, ""It's been a while,"" which made me think he'd done it before.  I couldn't find anything during my attempt of searching on Google, but I could have sworn there had been a moment with JS in a chair in an early episode too. So is that image still pretty clear in your mind or is this definitely the one you had been thinking of?"

I also could have sworn that a while ago, someone had asked one of the RM-info-related Tumblrs about which episode that had occurred in, but I couldn't find anything through the keywords I had searched with.  EDIT: The ask in question may have even been about SJ instead of JS, but I'm still not sure. Though it seems like it had happened in jail, so either of them are fairly likely."

koreanvariety,38xlss,mkatter,11,Sun Jun 7 18:33:28 2015 UTC,"Looking great!   MBC My Little Television sells out all of its commercial slots as advertisers take notice of its recent success. The show has aired 7 episodes to date. Source: OSEN (in Korean) Also, My Little Television is extremely popular among younger audiences and that has translated into the video on demand (VOD) market. My Little Television is ranked #2 out of all programs in the VOD power rankings. (#1 is Infinite Challenge) Source: Joy News 24 (in Korean) MBC Infinite Challenge has not let go of the #1 spot since October 4, 2014, when it was beaten by KBS Immortal Song. KBS Human Condition 3's ratings have gone from 2.9% to 3.6% to 4.4%. The show has successfully quelled concerns that people had about rooftop urban farming. Very positive feedback from viewers as the show is fun while also promoting an eco-friendly lifestyle in the urban jungle of Seoul. SBS Same Bed Different Dreams achieves its all-time of 6.6% in episode 7. Episode 1 started out with 4.4%, which happens to be the all-time low rating.    Its ratings resemble a roller coaster ride of sorts: 4.4, 5.5, 6.3, 6.2, 4.8, 5.7, 6.6. None of the other programming in that time slot does this so I'm guessing Same Bed Different Dreams has yet to establish a core, loyal audience.   MBC Sunday Night recovers back into double digits thanks to Mask King and a revitalized Real Men. Only 2.0% behind KBS Happy Sunday but it's still a daunting task to wrest away the #1 spot. MBC drama Make a Woman Cry breaks the 20% barrier for very the first time in its 16th episode. MBC King of Mask Singer posts an all-time high of 11.3% on its 10th episode. First episode started out at 6.1%. All-time low was 5.7% on second episode.   Meh...   tvN drama Ex-Girlfriend Club was originally planned for 16 episodes but it will be reduced to 12 episodes.   The first episode got 1.162%. It was the first and last time it exceeded the 1.0% mark. Lowest rating was 0.649%.  The drama that preceded it, Super Daddy Yul, went below 1.0% only once out of 16 episodes, peaking at 1.863%. Ex-Girlfriend Club will be replaced by Oh My Ghost in the first week of July.  SBS Star King continues its downward spiral. Three months ago, the show was getting ratings in the 9~10% range. Now, it's a struggle to break 7%.    The recent format changes and the re-addition of Leeteuk as an MC aren't helping out with viewership.  KBS Happy Together drops to a new all-time low of 4.2%. It's still good enough for the #2 spot.    Finale   SBS drama Heard It Through the Grapevine aired its 30th and last episode on June 2.   Upcoming   New couples join MBC We Got Married.    Song Jae-rim & Kim So-eun // Henry Lau & Ye-won leave the show. (BTOB) Yook Sungjae & (Red Velvet) Joy // Oh Min-seok & Kang Ye-won join the show.  SBS drama High Society (상류사회) will replace Heard It Through the Grapevine, starting on June 8.   Main cast: Sung Joon, UEE, Park Hyung-sik, Im Ji-yeon More info: Wikipedia, Soompi forum  MBC pilot Again (어게인) will air two episodes, replacing Police 2015 for the next two weeks. Police 2015 will resume on June 25 but depending on the feedback and ratings of the pilot, there could be changes.    The show's concept is reunions. The pilot will feature a reunion of the actors and actresses of a 1999 drama called 왕초, which featured Cha In-pyo, Song Yoon-ah, Kim Nam-joo, Yoon Tae-young, etc.  KBS is preparing new variety show called We Are Siblings (우리는 형제입니다). The show will revolve around stars and their siblings spending 48 hours together. The show will air sometime in July, presumably after The Producers ends.    EXID's Hani and her younger brother is confirmed to appear.   KBS's new soccer variety show, Youth FC (청춘FC), has completed its first test on June 1. Hosted by former soccer player Ahn Jung-hwan, the show is about giving an unforgettable experience to those who have failed to achieve their dream of becoming a professional soccer player. Open registration for anyone above 18. They will undergo several tests and those who pass the tryouts will be taken to Europe for  training. This show will also air sometime in July.    Old (but still relevant) News   tvN The Genius Season 4's first episode will be on June 27, replacing SNL Korea Season 6.   SNL Korea Season 6 is not being cancelled nor is the season ending. The show will make improvements to its skits and crew during the downtime while The Genius airs. SNL Korea will resume when The Genius ends. Source: OSEN (in Korean)  KBS's pilot program Looking Back at Myself (나를 돌아봐) will become a regular program.   It will replace The Producers (Fri/Sat 9:15 PM) or Orange Marmalade (Fri 10:35 PM). The specific date and the time has not been determined.  KBS's Lady Action (레이디 액션) is in talks of being turned into a regular program.

koreanvariety,38sske,deoxix,1 point,Tue Jun 9 12:22:53 2015 UTC,"I have to say in a good way that this was a pretty convoluted resolution. This was one of the most arguable episodes and they had a hard time choosing one. Everything really fitted in on the explanation but you had to really think a lot to see how all the parts of the crime went on and they had to rely on important clues at the very end.   Next time, the mystery of the hunters and the disappeared body. With Jinho 100% dressed as detective conan, the thing of everyone being isolated there and the thing of something missing it really feels like one of the episodes."
koreanvariety,38y59i,Hyperion98,12,Sun Jun 7 21:02:04 2015 UTC,i dont know why youre making a big deal out of this . why are there so many easily butthurt people nowadays ?
koreanvariety,38y59i,ilangshot,-1,Sun Jun 7 23:07:38 2015 UTC,Because people like being easily offended. Or something.
koreanvariety,38y59i,nighoblivion,8,Tue Jun 9 19:34:41 2015 UTC,"No. It was all in good fun and no one seemed to mind. These guys are close and have done the ""pulling down your opponent's pants"" gag before. And as the wise Yoo Jae Suk once told Song Ji Hyo: ""Whatever you do in front of the camera is forgiven. But if you do the same when the camera is off, that is not like a professional."" I assume all the members are on the same page in that regard after working together on the show for almost five years."
koreanvariety,38y59i,NowBiggerAndBetter,2,Sun Jun 7 22:03:06 2015 UTC,"Where'd you get this quote from? Seems like wise words to me. (I'm in the camp that found the scene completely and utterly hilarious, and it didn't even look like KJK was that mad about it.)"
koreanvariety,38y59i,concreteroads,3,Tue Jun 9 05:00:00 2015 UTC,"Song Ji Hyo was a guest on ""Strong Heart"" a few years ago and talked about her experiences as a Running Man cast member and how Yoo Jae Suk calmed her worries of ""taking it too far"" (in her case in regards to ""flirting"" with male guests on the show as a joke) with these words."
koreanvariety,38y59i,NowBiggerAndBetter,2,Tue Jun 9 07:21:24 2015 UTC,"Ah, makes sense. Thanks for the reference! :)"
koreanvariety,38y59i,concreteroads,1 point,Tue Jun 9 13:58:18 2015 UTC,Why am I thinking that he said something similar during the jjakji tournament episode?
koreanvariety,38y59i,nighoblivion,4,Tue Jun 9 19:33:56 2015 UTC,"I mean, you have all the right to feel uncomfortable and offended (same goes for saying it's overboard), but the way I see it is if Jong Kook was really that mad and offended, they would probably settle it themselves off camera. Again, running man has moments where cast member was stripped or showed naked (censored?) before (not even going to list them but would show proof if you think I'm lying), why all the fuss now? I get all the people saying that Kwang Soo is the Maknae and he shouldn't have done that, but if Jong Kook didn't (at least on camera) say anything or even seem offended, why are you all offended for him? Heck, looking back at running man episodes, some of Kwang Soo's tricks in the past would have been far more rude though (not hating)   I may not know how Korean Variety shows work (how much say the host or cast have when they find something that offends them that they don't want it broadcast) but I believe after all those years, running man production crew might know where/when they shouldn't cross the line. As a variety show's cast, I believe Jong Kook will let it slide due to being it funny (to some people) as it's good material for variety shows. (Again, it's just my opinion.)  Regardless, I personally think when Jong Kook is hitting Kwang Soo with the soft basketball (kinda?) half off-sccreen is more uncomfortable for me. Again, that's just me and this is just my opinion. I hope I don't offend anybody and sorry if I do, and sorry I can't please everyone. Hope you have a good day. Running Man Fighting :)"
koreanvariety,38y59i,JunYiDeWorld,-4,Tue Jun 9 16:39:07 2015 UTC,"How do we know he isn't mad or angry? We all don't but most of us just expressing our concern. That is all.

About LKS, Gary and others getting the same treatment of pranks before this episodes, I do commented on it in other forums/sites from time to time. I don't take anyone's side but I do care for Running Man casts as a whole.   I mean, from what I think (and that's just my opinion), the cast really do try their best to give us funny variety body gag. If it was overboard for them, I do believe they would have stopped by now (be it personally saying from one cast to another) with all the body gag.   Like what Ji Hyo/Jae Suk once said and /u/NowBiggerAndBetter has brought up:  -And as the wise Yoo Jae Suk once told Song Ji Hyo: ""Whatever you do in front of the camera is forgiven. But if you do the same when the camera is off, that is not like a professional.""

koreanvariety,38y59i,GooYo,2,Mon Jun 8 00:18:13 2015 UTC,"It's Running Man, ep 151 Haha makes something like that with Kwang Soo's boxers when they are playing the first game. That is Running Man."
koreanvariety,38y59i,Warlord_X,5,Sun Jun 7 22:06:45 2015 UTC,"No it was fine. You are over dramatizing this and blowing it out of proportion. Big Bang had a great time, Running Man had a great time, most viewers did as well. You didnt, cool story. Just dont watch it next time. Whats the point on coming on reddit and ranting about something that 1. Not going to change how you feel about this issue 2. Look for other people to share your opinion so you can feel justified in ranting. Both are vague reasons for posting.   What happened to KJK to me is just part of Running Man's charm, and this is coming from a 8 year fan of KJK. They are family its all in good fun. You need to lighten up."
koreanvariety,38y59i,ubiquitous_suffering,5,Mon Jun 8 01:51:06 2015 UTC,I think the PD will give him (KJK) a revenge episode to pay them back like some of their previous revenge themed episodes.

koreanvariety,38y59i,Warlord_X,2,Mon Jun 8 05:11:28 2015 UTC,Kookie fangirls are so crazy and hypocritical
koreanvariety,38y59i,kyopda,5,Mon Jun 8 23:48:02 2015 UTC,"Yes, you are definitely not alone. The official SBS Running Man board blew up with complaints asking LKS to apologize and criticizing how the staff went over the limits to air that.  http://program.sbs.co.kr/builder/verticalBoard.do?pgm_id=00000330171&pgm_build_id=149&pgm_mnu_id=23011&pageIdx=1&bbsCd=tb_nsunday_28&searchCondition=title&searchKeyword=  Some of the few I saw are:  -Are you guys in the right mind to air that?  -Now I bet elementary school kids are imitate that to take other people's pants off.  -Both LKS who took KJK's pants off, and you staffs who didn't edit that out, what do you think you are doing?  -YJS, LKS, and the staff, please apologize.  -LKS doesn't know the limits to overreact like that. Please put yourself under control.  -I am disappointed at YJS joining LKS to do that.  Funny thing is this is not the first and the only time. Similar thing happened at 4 years ago when KJK took YJS's pants off at Ep. 38 which got onto news, and KJK and the show received heavy criticisms.   I still can't believe despite what they had to go through and how much KJK had to suffer that time, they returned to doing this after a while. LKS taking KJK's pants off happened once before at 2NE1 episode (Ep. 156), and there are so many times LKS or YJS's pants got taken off during physical minigames. And the staff thinks it's a good joke looking at how they show replays or stop on those moments, and how they poked at YJS's underwear color at Ep. 205.  Looking back at how many times this happened already, taking pants off and making underwear jokes seem like one of the staff's obsessions like the mudfields and pressure mats. However, what happened at Ep. 38 already showed how much Korean viewers are turned off and hate it. And I can't believe they forgot all those troubles to make the same mistake over and over again except it was more direct and clear to the viewers this time.  One quote which described how the taking pants off incident at Ep. 38 was seen back then:  참고로 바지를 내리는 행위는 무한도전에서 박명수가 정준하에게 했다가[방송에는 나가지 않았다] 가해자가 피해자에게 거듭 사과하고 피해자에게도 트라우마로 남을 수 있는 위험한 개그다.  For a reference, the act of taking pants off is something what Park Myung-Soo did to Jung Junha, and it's a very dangerous joke which was edited out at Infinity Challenge."

koreanvariety,38y59i,arumdayo,-5,Mon Jun 8 09:31:16 2015 UTC,"It is a big deal, since complaining at the official SBS forum is more or less means complaining directly at the producers and/or the management themselves.  And to post there, one must use their real name, not using a fake id."
koreanvariety,38y59i,Warlord_X,-1,Mon Jun 8 15:41:22 2015 UTC,"That is SBS forum (Kookie Fangirls), where are the korean articles on naver, pann, etc, telling that its wrong, and where is the apology from PD, Kwang Soo, Jae Suk??"
koreanvariety,38y59i,arumdayo,-7,Mon Jun 8 17:36:32 2015 UTC,"Calling everybody who thinks the joke being too far as Kookie fangirls shows how mature and easy going you really are.

koreanvariety,38y59i,NowBiggerAndBetter,5,Sun Jun 7 22:11:25 2015 UTC,"They were playing a basketball-like game in a river and because their team was behind, Jae Suk, Kwangsoo & others relieved Jong Kook first of his shorts & later also of his underpants, to make sure that he couldn't stand up and play for the opposing team but had to stay seated in the water so no one could see anything ""down there"". It was all in good fun, everyone was enjoying themselves during the game & afterwards & no one seemed to mind. Typical Running Man shenanigans between the members, OP is making a mountain out of a molehill, I'd say."
koreanvariety,38y59i,furyswipesoflove,1 point,Sun Jun 7 22:55:16 2015 UTC,"Just look at all these excuses you loyal fans came up with. So would you defend these Running Man strippings when they strip Jihyo or come to the show all naked for ""fun?"" Would you prefer they even hurl racist jokes or beat someone down on TV just because they are ""close friends?"" Do you think those viewers would forgive those like Jaesuk said. These are the limits and manners you people don't seem to understand here. How can you defend when Running Man proudly promotes it is childish and will do anything for ""fun"" like this?"
koreanvariety,38y59i,concreteroads,3,Thu Jun 11 18:49:59 2015 UTC,"For obvious reasons, Ji-hyo is the only RM member we've never seen stripped/naked. The cast and crew members clearly have set their own personal boundaries, the way any people set social/relationship boundaries in interacting with each other. (Also you talk about RM all coming to the show naked like it hasn't happened... but some of them totally have. How many times has Kwang-soo lost his shirt or pants and hammed it up for the camera? How many times have we seen Wild Gary clearly sleeping naked even though he knows he's being filmed?) Obviously forcibly taking a girl's clothes off on national television is different from showing us a shirtless dude. So I don't see how these two situations are even comparable. You're right, there are limits and manners-- I just don't see this situation as breaking those bounds."
koreanvariety,38y59i,Jynxette,1 point,Sat Jun 13 12:11:56 2015 UTC,The situation that happened and the situation in your comment are on different levels and it would be ridiculous to compare them together.
koreanvariety,38y59i,arumdayo,-5,Fri Jun 12 00:00:30 2015 UTC,"True, it is very funny when you strip someone naked, record it and show it to the rest of the world.   It became funnier when others start to imitate it especially kids who watch the show and start stripping their friends, record it and show it to others because it is no big deal and they were having a good time and the viewers too. Except for the victim who is forced to accept it as for fun."
koreanvariety,38y59i,concreteroads,1 point,Mon Jun 8 15:47:00 2015 UTC,"If you've ever seen middle-school/high-school aged boys fooling around... news flash: they probably already do everything that the RM cast does to each other, except in an even less happy and joking way. With the Running Man cast, you know it's a give and take kind of thing. How many times have we seen other members partially or fully (Gary lol, and Kwang-soo sort of) naked in the past? Usually at the hands of KJK.   Jong-kook isn't ""forced"" to accept anything. In the past, we've seen him actually get angry and turn sullen, but that didn't even happen this time... he was freaking out while his boxers were getting stripped off, understandably, but he was literally joking around and chill with Kwang-soo as soon as he managed to cover up and stand up out of the water. It didn't seem like a big deal at all, and clearly a large number of viewers did find the scene very funny, as was the intention."
koreanvariety,38y59i,arumdayo,0,Tue Jun 9 14:02:07 2015 UTC,"News flash: not everything people do is acceptable. Bullies has, is and will continue justifies their bullying as jokes between friends and they did nothing wrong."
koreanvariety,38y59i,concreteroads,0,Wed Jun 10 02:40:49 2015 UTC,"I think you are taking the definition of bullying way too far. It's only bullying if it's done with malicious intent. Friends joke around with friends all the time-- not to mention family members, which is basically what the RM cast and crew is by now. Are you going to go complain about high school boys horsing around and getting physical with each other, when they're clearly friends and neither party takes the fight seriously? Because that's what this argument seems like."
koreanvariety,38y59i,arumdayo,1 point,Wed Jun 10 02:45:57 2015 UTC,"I think you take bullying too lightly. Bullying can happen between close friends who are having fun by playing jokes on each other. It is not uncommon for friendships to break after a joke went too far.  Often, bullying takes place in the presence of a large group of relatively uninvolved bystanders. In many cases, it is the bully’s ability to create the illusion that he or she has the support of the majority present (just like Lee Kwang Soo & Yoo Jae Suk has the support of the production crews and fans) that instills the fear of “speaking out” in protestation of the bullying activities (Kim Jong Kook couldn’t do anything about it, his protestations ignored) being observed by the group. Unless the “bully mentality” is effectively challenged in any given group in its early stages, it often becomes an accepted, or supported, norm within the group (everything is forgiven by the production crew and the fans, and accepted as the norm)."
koreanvariety,38y59i,concreteroads,1 point,Sat Jun 13 10:54:02 2015 UTC,"I agree bullying is an issue. I'm just saying it's not an issue here. And while bullying can happen between originally close friends, that usually signals the end of a friendship... as even you've said. These RM members have joked around and gotten very physical/""up close and personal"" with each other over the past what-- five years? And their relationship only seems stronger now, even off camera (as evidenced by numerous 'Race Start' events, fan meets, individual interviews, etc etc etc, not to mention their amazing camaraderie), so clearly no one is harbouring any grudges or hard feelings. So to liken this situation to bullying is really extreme.   I don't think the RM crew edits maliciously, or is particularly biased to any of the members. Even the most popular members like Yoo Jae-Suk have had horribly embarrassing moments on camera (I remember in Yoomes Bond episode, netizens went wild then too when Jong-kook pantsed him for the first time), both by choice and because of other members' actions; while even the arguably least popular (in polls and such, I don't mean in terms of my personal opinion) such as Gary or Suk-Jin have moments of blazing glory. So I think there's absolutely nothing to show a bullying minority vs. a bystander majority, since EVERYONE in the RM cast has done terribly embarrassing or aggressive things to each other. As I alluded to in my earlier comments, the RM have done this way too often in the past, including with consent. Someone will lose their shirt or pants and start hamming it up for the camera. Or the boys will raise Jong-kook's shirt and start showing off and praising the Commander's abs for him. Clothing has gotten torn and torn off in many earlier scuffles. People like Gary sleep fully naked, knowing that they're going to get filmed like that, or even exposed like he got fully and totally exposed in the Australia episodes. We saw about as much of him then as we did of KJK here-- and Gary wasn't even doing anything in that case, just sleeping and got ambushed. And yet him and Haha did and still do often refer to each other as good/best friends.   The cast dynamic seems tighter-knit and better than ever. The production crew clearly considers members' physical limitations when designing games (such as Jong-kook's back issues), and the members clearly watch out for each other. (They'll never let each other do too bad things to Ji-hyo for example, even though some of them do get quite physical with her.) Everything about this show is give-and-take. For Jong-kook to have the right to do stuff that's considered crazy and disrespectful in Korean culture, like pushing his hyungs around and threatening them on multiple occasions, he needs to take their retaliation sometimes. The same way any normal relationship functions off of give and take."
koreanvariety,38y59i,arumdayo,0,Sat Jun 13 12:24:22 2015 UTC,"To put it simply, that is what all those bullies are saying... ""No hard feelings"", ""We are still friends"", ""No one harbouring grudges""..."

If you think it's good enough if they have a vacation please go to forced work on india for a full day with another full day of travel before going on to your next travel) but with a week of cooldown i'm less heated about it. I agreed with Haha when he said this was the idea on a brainstorm that they could think it was funny but it was unrealistic. In some sense they could had worse jobs (Ha & Soo got a good one fortunately) with way worse conditions but the simple fact they get to do this instead of doing it of their own free will makes it a bit wrong for me.   In the other hand, and that's going to sound completely contrary to what i'm defending, i think Myung Soo and Jun Ha could had a harder more representative job of what they do in nairobi instead of going to the cliche of the african jungle. It's important to preserve the fauna but i'm going to take the guess that park ranger/zookeeper isn't the main job in Nairobi.   Anyways, don't feel the need to bear with me, if you can go over my criticism you can enjoy (as i did it) how they tell all the bad news in the right moment. It was a nice episode."

I love their banter so much. Jinho is more likely to work with Sangmin than Dongmin since Dongmin is more domineering in teamplay while Sangmin tends to be neutral and prefers to manoeuvre play from the background. That said, half of the cast are like Jinho's harem so, well..."
koreanvariety,38mxib,femacca,5,Fri Jun 5 07:10:03 2015 UTC,"Jinho keeps his word and doesn't betray his teammates, the harem is inevitable."

Off the top of my head people friendly with Jinho this season are Jungmoon, Kyungran, Yoonsun, Junseok, Junghyun, and maybe Dongmin. That's a strong group right off the bat."
koreanvariety,38mxib,Siantlark,6,Fri Jun 5 15:32:27 2015 UTC,"Jungmoon was never part of Jinho's team in season 1 and Kyungran had the most foul face expression in all of the three seasons in the last two episodes of s1. Not sure how Yoonsun and Junghyun will interact with Jinho this time but Dongmin sure isn't going to be.   Right off the bat I see Dongmin and Hyunmin teaming up again. Dongmin with his team making and leadership and Hyunmin with his unprecedented brain. I really do think Hyunmin is the slyer, willing to be more aggressive version of Jinho."
koreanvariety,38mxib,hamhamsuke,1 point,Fri Jun 5 16:32:26 2015 UTC,Jungmoon worked with Jinho in Ep 5/6 and Kyungran worked with him consistently throughout the season which also goes for Yoonsun. We'll see how it works out.

Maybe it's because it's how the show is edited but almost all episodes of s3, Hyunmin had a plan instantly. Like he knew right away how to game it.  I rather Jinho win it though and my second favourite being Dongmin."

I haven't been in this sub for a while so didn't even know there was going to be a G4 but I can imagine shit getting really dangerous for Sangmin because his usual style of play is controling from the background but doing so with the sheep, the less threatening and cunning people, he would be threading a very dangerous line with Dongmin and Jinho, one bad move and he'd get fucked."

Is it just a marketing thing to get their name out there before their debut?  Is JYP really going to trust a tv audience to select the members of his next girl group?

koreanvariety,38krno,SarcasticSarcophagus,1 point,Thu Jun 4 23:01:50 2015 UTC,"He said early on that maybe none of them will make it into the girl group. It is definitely a marketing thing. It worked for DSP because Kara was famous, and now JYPE is doing it with JYP himself being the famous one. The audience has influence because popularity matters, but nobody knows exactly what he's thinking.  With regards to Kara Project, Sojin was already well past debut age, the only other person that I know with a late debut is Girl's Day's Sojin. After the show, the contract between her and DSP ended and she fell into depression having lost her dream as well as her future.

koreanvariety,38is52,dattroll123,7,Fri Jun 5 07:03:52 2015 UTC,"I called it already a week ago in the last episode thread:  ""Btw, i though a couple of weeks ago after watching one episode about really doing a meta-episode. Instead of playing characters, they play a version of themselves (obviously not themselves because there has be a lot of the usual stuff of romance, debt and vengeance...). The crime is that while everyone was either on the dressing room or wandering the channel building (preparing for the incoming recording) a show writer appears in the middle of the scene killed with what seems it would be the murder weapon for that case and then thrown off the high part of the scenario (the part with the lights, don't know what it's called) similar to how the fake crime was committed, but more really in a ironic way than intentionally. You can play it like the show does (the dressing room, offices etc are in that style of rooms with no walls, just props) or you can play it with the real rooms (and the scenario just one more gigantic room but without really much clues). You can have one guest that plays the role of the main producer, or the president of the channel if they have the balls, for example.  Think about the possibilities. Using the murder weapon for the case, for example, implies that that person already knew what it was (if they used it intentionally) so it could be the person with the role of the ""fake"" killer or someone that was cheating to look good on camera deducting things. Another thing they could was instead of playing themselves, playing the role of some other for comic reasons (imagine Jang Jin playing Hani). They could make everything a little bit less serious, like making Jinho being mean to the staff because they laugh at his pronunciation of things or making someone act like they are a huge bitch behind the cameras and being nice it's just a facade. The last thing is something that the cynic me thinks from time to time, although a like to think most of them are nice people.  Edit: Another idea for it. In the episode before make them select the fake roles, then play a preview of the mock case just to make everyone unprepared (basically just record enough scenes to make the preview). In the proper episode make the part of the detective looking at the false dead body, going through the suspects and so on. But, then, before calling the suspects put another shot from a camera that looks behind the scene with the staff preparing things and the cast on the scene before some production assistant goes running to them (to give them coffee or something, nothing serious) and he/she trips on the real dead body (remember that the scenario is dark before they reveal it), shouts like really panicked and everybody comes to there. Then, the footage rewinds to a flashback of them picking the roles last episode and how they were really picking the other roles. Then, they call a real police officer, like last season, to play the real role of the detective."""

koreanvariety,38is52,gyaki,2,Fri Jun 5 03:16:57 2015 UTC,"I sorta had a similar thought as well when I came across this - ""The names of the victims are the names of Crime Scene staff"". Unfortunately I do not have an imaginative mind so I won't be able to craft any decent ideas from it. Nevertheless, it will be fun involving behind-the-scene real life folks with the member cast of the reality show to form a mega-complex episode as a finale.   And since Yoo Jae Suk is going to work with Yoon PD who does Crime Scene and Abnormal Summit, perhaps he can even make a special non-role playing guest appearance in the final episode to end the season with a bang. (I so wish!)"
koreanvariety,38is52,femacca,2,Fri Jun 5 07:20:52 2015 UTC,I was thinking about this and its really hard to setup character backgrounds amd equal set of motives for all the players. Lastly if they would present fake motives for the character themselvesit still boils down on their own enteetainment company to look it over and decide if the said fake motive would not tarnish their images

koreanvariety,386dvn,redqueenalice,3,Tue Jun 2 22:07:40 2015 UTC,it might be because of the production cost of the show? i mean it's a cable show with only about 12 episodes and they dish out over 60k in awards alone. that seems to be alot... but i could be wrong since idk much about these stuff
koreanvariety,3866g2,mkatter,5,Tue Jun 2 03:18:53 2015 UTC,"Yoo Jae Suk and Kang Ho Dong were the only top MCs to have never appeared in a non-terrestrial channel (KBS, SBS, MBC, EBS).    So naturally, reporters from OSEN (in Korean) asked Kang Ho Dong about his stance and his side replied that he isn't limiting himself to terrestrial channels. He has been in talks but nothing had been decided yet. Currently, Kang Ho Dong is only appearing in two shows, 'Cool Kiz on the Block' and 'Star King'.    JTBC is doing a heck of a job establishing itself as the front runner among the general cable channels."
koreanvariety,3866g2,ginastringr,9,Tue Jun 2 03:37:05 2015 UTC,"Whoaa another show with Yoo Neu Nim.. 4 shows a week and all of them are doing well right now.  Speaking of JTBC, I kind of want him in a show like Crime Scene or The Genius lol"
koreanvariety,3866g2,deoxix,2,Tue Jun 2 03:47:38 2015 UTC,"Well, the detective special they were going to do on Infinity Challenge was almost the same as Crime Scene (see for yourself) so there you have it."
koreanvariety,3866g2,natcookie,1 point,Wed Jun 3 00:20:54 2015 UTC,what episode is this? after googling i got episode 368 but some article i found stated that detective special was not aired due to Gil's incident so i'm confused.

koreanvariety,3866g2,Hitokiri2,2,Tue Jun 2 17:10:09 2015 UTC,"JTBC has been landing a lot of big names on many shows lately. I guessing it's a combination of big bucks, big promises, and evidence that JTBC can do well - that even led YJS to say yes to this.   Lately YJS has been creating more mellow talk show host like shows. ""I A Man"" and ""Same Bed Different Dreams"" were formatted this way and I wouldn't be surprised if the JTBC show was like this as well."
koreanvariety,3866g2,i_love_all,1 point,Tue Jun 2 18:07:11 2015 UTC,is he still doing same bed different dreams? or is this another show he is adding to his week?
koreanvariety,3866g2,jsrave,2,Tue Jun 2 03:59:56 2015 UTC,Usually the cable shows I've seen have shorter seasons (ie anywhere from 10-15 episodes) with a break in between. So this might be a good way for him to test his waters with a different styled show without messing with his schedule that much.
koreanvariety,3866g2,pokeiman,1 point,Tue Jun 2 13:00:43 2015 UTC,It's just another show he's adding to his schedule.

koreanvariety,3871gh,HvDreamer,7,Tue Jun 2 08:49:01 2015 UTC,Would it be bad of me if I cheered at this announcement?
koreanvariety,3871gh,Enter_Text_Here,7,Tue Jun 2 15:28:32 2015 UTC,Makes sense especially with the low ratings. Many are blaming Yewon's scandal a few months back for this but who knows...maybe she's being used a scapegoat.   I wish WGM could get one of the famous fake couples on Korean TV to do WGM. Gary and Song Ji Hyo or Kim Jong Kook and Yoon Eun Hye. I'm sure that would shoot the ratings straight up.
koreanvariety,3871gh,Hitokiri2,6,Tue Jun 2 18:10:11 2015 UTC,"Yea, she's just a scapegoat at this point. WGM isn't doing too well even before she joined. Wow, if KJK + YEH goes on, that'd be insane."
koreanvariety,3871gh,alastoris,3,Tue Jun 2 18:51:10 2015 UTC,Yewon came out with a hand written letter apologizing and basically taking the blame for her actions and how it affected WGM. I still think she's being scapegoated but I guess in the eyes of the Korean public she was guilty already.   http://www.soompi.com/2015/06/02/yewon-posts-handwritten-letter-apologizing-to-lee-tae-im-henry-and-viewers/
koreanvariety,3871gh,Hitokiri2,10,Tue Jun 2 19:01:38 2015 UTC,"Kinda expected this, they weren't a particularly memorable couple. They were just very... fake? It seemed just too unnatural and awkward. I'm going to anticipate the next couple, hopefully they can do better."
koreanvariety,3871gh,SarcasticSarcophagus,5,Tue Jun 2 09:11:09 2015 UTC,"i always enjoy new couples. but yeah i usually skip through yewon and henry.   i wonder wat yewon will do now. no more girl group. she just had that controversy with the actress and now no more wgm.  edit: well she just posted an apology letter, like 4 months late -.- guess she had to do something"
koreanvariety,3871gh,i_love_all,2,Tue Jun 2 12:26:19 2015 UTC,They have yet to film their last meeting.  2 new couples will join the show after they leave.  Edit:  English article.
koreanvariety,3871gh,dattroll123,2,Tue Jun 2 08:54:42 2015 UTC,I never really get the hate for these two. WGM has been going downhill even before they appeared on the show since it's the same cookie cutter formula.  I kinda want to see a Henry + Amber couple actually.

Henry is too Forward even for ""Western Style"" of dating, I would say.  It depends on how close you were prior to dating. Seemed like Yewon was uncomfortable at first but she probably accepted it for the show."
koreanvariety,3871gh,polidarida,1 point,Wed Jun 3 04:32:20 2015 UTC,a win-win decision. netizen got what they ask for and both henry and yewon don't worsen their bad image much more
koreanvariety,3871gh,gatchaman_ken,0,Wed Jun 3 12:45:21 2015 UTC,I guess I'm one of the few people that will miss them. I thought they made a nice couple. It's funny how many people are calling them out as fake on a fake marriage show. Jonghyun and Seungyeon seem more fake and nobody can be as bad as Hong Jonghyun acting like Yura had cooties.

koreanvariety,383cnh,arumdayo,1 point,Mon Jun 1 18:47:43 2015 UTC,That epd still doesn't sit right with me the way Eunji was out. Especially when I know apink had a schedule later that day and Eunji had to be out before the closing.
koreanvariety,383cnh,alastoris,1 point,Tue Jun 2 00:27:39 2015 UTC,It is some kind of unwritten rule for the members to let the guests win or at least to make sure they survive till (almost) the end. So Eun Ji's out is scripted to let her go to the other schedule.
koreanvariety,383cnh,and_we_ran,1 point,Mon Jun 8 12:46:58 2015 UTC,"Yea, I realize that. But letting guest win usually means just going easy on them. In Eunji case, it was really obviously scripted. Way too obvious. Which is a shame really, I not sure why they asked her to be a guest when she's only going to be there for 1.4 games."

koreanvariety,37zjbp,icanbeyourzero,10,Tue Jun 2 01:30:14 2015 UTC,"agreed. but i don't mind that though, her 'pairing up' with kwangsoo is so hilarious, KwangMong siblings fight ferociously with each other but then taking care each other when game ended.   anw final game is so good! hope they play that again (with some changes ofc) in the future!"
koreanvariety,37zjbp,natcookie,1 point,Tue Jun 2 02:54:40 2015 UTC,"I honestly cannot remember when they were paired up as a couple - feels like it was about a year ago. However, I’ve always loved Suk Jin & Gary together, their conversations are hilarious. Spartace is a terrible pairing though. I know many people ship it, but in my opinion, they’ve never been fun together, always dead-serious and variety-cliché dialogue."
koreanvariety,37zjbp,Resistantperm,2,Fri Jun 5 02:44:51 2015 UTC,gary also does pretty well when paired with female guests so maybe the PDs would rather give ji suk jin to ji hyo.
koreanvariety,37zjbp,tiniesttaco,2,Sat Jun 6 07:09:25 2015 UTC,So I don't know anything about this stuff but my sister is in Korea and the big rumor with Ji Hyo is that like someone in the Korean mob or something really likes her and so it's like people can't date her basically and maybe Gary is just a bit too chummy in running man. I seriously have no idea if it's true but they say it happens with quite a few Korean actresses. That's just the rumor people are saying there
koreanvariety,37zjbp,blockdmyownshot,9,Tue Jun 2 03:59:48 2015 UTC,she was at one point dating her company ceo and if I remember correctly I saw comments saying he had mob connections.  that maybe what you heard

koreanvariety,37zjbp,BackedBean,2,Wed Jun 3 21:51:20 2015 UTC,"I'm actually not sure since I have never downloaded the 1080p torrents, nor have I paid close attention to the (rarely and randomly available) 1080 streams on KShowOnline. But based on the 1080p option for the YouTube links, it's basically still 1080i, which I know is a format still available for new/current episodes.   I think I also once heard someone else confirm that the 1080p versions had never actually been 1080p-quality as SBS only airs its HD shows in 720p.  Hopefully someone more knowledgeable in all of that can clarify further if that's not the situation."
koreanvariety,37zjbp,amelisa28,1 point,Thu Jun 4 00:30:27 2015 UTC,"The reason I asked, was because I heard they don't record in 1080p, but that youtube video is in 1080p and looks far better than the HD RM on dramafever."

Running Man should've just played simple game like this. Even though the guests this time is great, I'm sure they can do as funny  as this episode without any guest.  Interaction between members is what makes RM great. With simple game like this, they can have a lot of fun interaction compared to bigger and more complicated ones."

But it's okay I guess~    EDIT: I just found out about dramafever being so fleshed out. All these years I've just been looking for WITH or BARO uploads with sub files.. Is dramafever worth the sub?

koreanvariety,37zjbp,CKtalon,0,Wed Jun 3 12:18:54 2015 UTC,Might stick with free dramafever account for a while first. Sometimes I get tired of looking around for the subtitle file. Where do you usually get yours? Within the asiatorrent post?

Last 3 weeks of episodes: 5.0, 6.0, 6.0, 6.7, 6.8, 7.1.  So...when were the last three times SBS's Jagiya was beaten by another program? It seems to be #1 all the time...

Sets a personal high of 10.4% in its 9th episode.   The show started out at 6.1% and hit rock bottom at 5.7% in its second episode. What a quick turnaround.  KBS's 1 Night 2 Days holds onto the #1 spot for 8 weeks in a row and 12 times in the past 14 weeks.    Meh...   SBS Some Guy Some Girl hits 3.1% for the second time in 3 weeks. 3.1% is the lowest rating yet (5 episodes total).   First episode started off with 4.3%. It hasn't broken the 4.0% barrier since then.  MBC Quiz to Change the World falls to a pitiful 3.6%... and it's not a surprise at the very least because the entire show has become a goddamn joke </rant>.   I personally suspect that this is the worst rating ever in its history but not all of the ratings are available.  The show started on April 4, 2009 and it has aired 298 episodes so far. The ratings that I can access only go back to December 25, 2010 (episode 83).  The show was consistently in the 17-22% range in episodes 85-110 (Jan-July 2011) and shows back in 2009-2010 typically had very high ratings (1 Night 2 Days ~30%, Family Outing ~20%, etc.).

It is a drama, as opposed to a variety show. I preferred the Japanese version over the Korean version though. I believe it was originally a manga too if you would prefer going that route.   As for variety shows in general, the ones listed in the right sidebar are pretty much the most popular ones. Crime Scene and The Genius are mostly popular because there aren't many shows revolving around critical thinking (other than also being well done). There are of course many quiz show type shows, however."

koreanvariety,37zfw3,deoxix,0,Wed Jun 3 10:45:11 2015 UTC,"For your good luck, the 4th season (and unfortunately last, more like because they can't get more ideas out of it. I prefer to keep it on a peak than to get it die slowly on 30 seasons though) is starting at the end of June with a special with all people that played before (including the 3 champions).  About your questions there aren't really any other show similar to these two except a couple of episodes in 2 popular varieties. These kind of episodes, however, are more focused on long/physical chases (often through a large urban area like Seoul) with very simple but deep rules so what you see is more improvising and betraying each other for fun (and sometimes just to make it entertaining) than complex strategies. Also, the people playing it aren't really very intelligent people and that's kind of the charm. The point is to don't take everything they do that seriously.   I'm a infinity challenge fan (see my flair) so it's pretty much obligatory to recommend you some of them. Just try one and see if you can get hooked to the difference that you will see in the style. Also, the show isn't really about this, so look for the episodes when they do this.  The most recent ""chase"" (2 episodes) they did:  http://www.dramafever.com/drama/4337/66/Infinity_Challenge/?ap=1 http://www.dramafever.com/es/drama/4337/67/Infinity_Challenge/?ap=1  (if you live in America or have a good proxy) or http://www.epdrama.com/infinity-challenge/infinity-challenge-episode-414/ and http://www.epdrama.com/infinity-challenge/infinity-challenge-episode-415/"

koreanvariety,37sepi,0moe,1 point,Sat May 30 12:58:43 2015 UTC,Probably harder then you think. You have no privacy. You can never act the way you want to or say what's really on your mind. You don't really control your life - your agency or schedule does that for you. You can't have an open relationship due to contract issues or just in case the person you like/love gets hurt. Everyone THINKS they know you but they really don't. Your family is probably mobbed all the time as well mostly when a scandal or something big happens to you. You can't do anything by yourself or out in the open. Most of the money you make at the beginning of your career probably goes to your company. Some people are known for a certain role or a certain type of role all their life never being able to show their true capabilities as an entertainer. Etc...etc..etc..
koreanvariety,37sepi,Hitokiri2,1 point,Sat May 30 16:40:41 2015 UTC,"That its for idols, and Kwang Soo renewed his contract with the company this year and he had many other companies behind him, if he renewed the contract its because he has absolute control about everything."
koreanvariety,37sepi,GooYo,1 point,Sat May 30 20:26:55 2015 UTC,Do you really believe that? I think you should listen to more actors on variety shows like on Happy Together. Their lives are not much different from the lives of Kpop idols. They're pretty much as the mercy of their company and how many people they know. It's not easy at all and I think that's a misconception.   I do believe being an actor or actress is probably easier then being a Kpop idol (thus why so many Kpop idols turn to acting) but it's not far from the life of glam and glory that people think.
koreanvariety,37sepi,Hitokiri2,1 point,Sat May 30 21:29:00 2015 UTC,"All celebrities under contract will be under control of which ever agency they decided to sign with. All celebrities will lose much of their public life due to paparazzi. Idols and actors alike. However, actors dating seems to be generally less of a deal than idols dating. So at least they got that going for them."
koreanvariety,37sepi,InfamousMike,0,Sun May 31 13:53:06 2015 UTC,Its his own choice. Many of the things you mention happen to idols not actors + they have relationships regardless.
koreanvariety,37sepi,0moe,0,Sat May 30 18:54:00 2015 UTC,I don't think so that's why people make fun of Gwangsoo and his relationships. Rumors are that he had some but isn't open with them for the reasons why Kpop idols are. If it was as open as you suggest then why is Gwangsoo hiding it and why is it so fun to poke fun of him and others in their relationships?   I think Kpop idols and Korean actors/actresses live a very hard life in the lime lights. It's just that there are more fans of Kpop then K-variety or Kdramas.
koreanvariety,37sepi,Hitokiri2,1 point,Sat May 30 21:31:29 2015 UTC,If they make fun about it openly thats all the more reason for me to believe that its not a sensible issue at all. LKS should be thankful to the cast for making fun of him about dating because he gets free laughs and air time.   Im not saying that they are open about their relationships - they arent but its an open secret that many are dating yet deny it.

Let me be clear, i'm ok and excited with them trying ""international extreme part time jobs"", however, by their own free will; not after being swindled (twice) and then forced to do their job but knowing what they were going to do. The anterior special was to show how with enough will the hard workers of the country can get to complete their job and live day after day to earn enough money, this is a trap with bad taste in which TaeHo PD literally escaped to cop out on telling them this and they're only doing it because it's in their contracts. I hope TaeHo PD ends having to do the same thing as they for a couple of hours until he gets on his senses.   Also, i said though that it was impossible to do that special, but they really did by reducing the places to three and getting maybe 2.5 episodes out of it."
koreanvariety,37qtw5,deoxix,4,Sat May 30 20:33:08 2015 UTC,I don't know what to tell you but IC being tricked by the pd's is par for the course. Do they deserve a vacation sure (and it's implied they get their vacation after the part-time job) but I think you're taking it a bit too seriously. lol

koreanvariety,37n14z,sportsteambfan,6,Sun May 31 19:51:13 2015 UTC,"One thing you probably didn't know about the victims on Crime Scene: http://kpopkfans.blogspot.ca/2015/05/secret-behind-names-of-victims-on-crime.html  Considering this and that the very first murder of the season was of a PD of the program we can safely conclude that... OH MY GOD STAFF, RUN!!!! THEY'RE GOING AFTER YOU ONE PER WEEK AND BUILD SOME KIND OF BULLSHIT SCENARIO JUST TO COVER IT!!!  and they don't even call the police but let all the suspects guess who did it while tampering the clues. The worst is that they really know who did it but if they don't guess right at the first try they let the murderer go free.   Btw, i though a couple of weeks ago after watching one episode about really doing a meta-episode. Instead of playing characters, they play a version of themselves (obviously not themselves because there has be a lot of the usual stuff of romance, debt and vengeance...). The crime is that while everyone was either on the dressing room or wandering the channel building (preparing for the incoming recording) a show writer appears in the middle of the scene killed with what seems it would be the murder weapon for that case and then thrown off the high part of the scenario (the part with the lights, don't know what it's called) similar to how the fake crime was committed, but more really in a ironic way than intentionally. You can play it like the show does (the dressing room, offices etc are in that style of rooms with no walls, just props) or you can play it with the real rooms (and the scenario just one more gigantic room but without really much clues). You can have one guest that plays the role of the main producer, or the president of the channel if they have the balls, for example.   Think about the possibilities. Using the murder weapon for the case, for example, implies that that person already knew what it was (if they used it intentionally) so it could be the person with the role of the ""fake"" killer or someone that was cheating to look good on camera deducting things. Another thing they could was instead of playing themselves, playing the role of some other for comic reasons (imagine Jang Jin playing Hani). They could make everything a little bit less serious, like making Jinho being mean to the staff because they laugh at his pronunciation of things or making someone act like they are a huge bitch behind the cameras and being nice it's just a facade. The last thing is something that the cynic me thinks from time to time, although a like to think most of them are nice people.   Edit: Another idea for it. In the episode before make them select the fake roles, then play a preview of the mock case just to make everyone unprepared (basically just record enough scenes to make the preview). In the proper episode make the part of the detective looking at the false dead body, going through the suspects and so on. But, then, before calling the suspects put another shot from a camera that looks behind the scene with the staff preparing things and the cast on the scene before some production assistant goes running to them (to give them coffee or something, nothing serious) and he/she trips on the real dead body (remember that the scenario is dark before they reveal it), shouts like really panicked and everybody comes to there. Then, the footage rewinds to a flashback of them picking the roles last episode and how they were really picking the other roles. Then, they call a real police officer, like last season, to play the real role of the detective.   TvN, call me!!!! I will make you rich."
koreanvariety,37n14z,deoxix,5,Fri May 29 02:29:32 2015 UTC,"To be completely honest, I thought that (your meta case) was what was happening when Jinho fell over dead at first.

I would've preferred another regular season before all-stars, but I suppose the producers thought there were enough major players to warrant an all-star season.  I'm happy to see Jinho, of course! completing the champion lineup is Sangmin and Dongmin, which is HYPE. Yohwan and Kyungran were both 2nd-placers so that's great as well (more Lim Jin Rok rivalry too!). Hopefully the rest of the cast to be announced includes Hyunmin, Sunggyu, and Yoohyun, since they are among my favorites.     edit: well, full cast is out! they got Junseok (seriously that guy had untapped potential - I didn't think they could get him because of his politician position). and our four open casting call players, Hyunmin, Yoohyun, Yeonseung, and Kyunghoon! now I'm a little sad Sunggyu isn't involved, busy with his solo and Infinite promos I guess D:"

koreanvariety,37fe8o,gintoki-sama,5,Wed May 27 08:15:44 2015 UTC,"What a great mix of very different characters and playing styles! Jinho and Dongmin are my personal favourites. Hyunmin will bring a strong game on since I rate him as the brainiest of all three seasons. Lee Junseok is my favourite non-top placing player, so I'm happy to see him back. Perhaps he and Junghyun will get to have a politician showdown of some sort as a sideshow. Kim Kyungran is a good choice since she brings a good balance to the cast given her strong image. Not sure if she will work well with Yoonsun since both are tough characters, but I want to see them both pressing down hard on Sangmin and Dongmin, haha. My hunch is Yoohyun and Yeonseung will likely place somewhere in the middle but Yoohyun may go into alliance mode with Yohwan since they are so close. Not sure what Choi Jungmoon could bring to the show though; I'd rather give Kwon Juri a chance. Kyunghoon and Yohwan can fight to see who has a thicker skin and can betray better."

koreanvariety,37fe8o,Siantlark,5,Wed May 27 13:31:27 2015 UTC,Why do you think that the scheming and backstabbing is cringeworthy? The games are designed so that people will scheme and betray other players.
koreanvariety,37fe8o,kyugi0923,9,Wed May 27 18:37:55 2015 UTC,"To a certain point. Some things that happened to Doohee in Season 2 were just distasteful though, producer designed or no."
koreanvariety,37fe8o,Bananauyu,1 point,Wed May 27 20:27:53 2015 UTC,"Oh I totally agree with that instance. How they treated Doohee was really disgusting and a joke that was taken too far.That's one of those things where it's no longer within the confines of the game and downright cruel. However, if a player betrays a team so that he/she can be saved from the elimination, then that sort of backstabbing is perfectly okay. The Doohee instance was more in the line of kicking someone when they're already down."
koreanvariety,37fe8o,kyugi0923,3,Wed May 27 20:35:28 2015 UTC,"I don't think the scheming and backstabbing was cringeworthy per se, I know its part of the game and enjoy most of it but I find it real hard to watch how they did it in season 2 (e.g. S02E06)"

I mean, Na PD decides to get the first 15 minutes to just show how the goat gives birth, how nature changes, the plants grow and blossom, the dog also grows... and while this in many varieties of the same theme it makes them veery boring here it works perfectly here. I think this is because of 4 reasons: they make not just like a documental but like a variety + audiovisual experience (in this episode for example the part of listening to the rain and last season the part of looking to the stars), the cast is kind of charming just to look at them relaxing and working, they have wittier captions than usual (reminds me of the captions they placed with the dog in 2D1N season 1) and because they use a lot of flash forwards just to hook the audience from time to time before going back to the rhythm of the show.  This isn't even the cliche: ""City boys goes farming without having any ideas and funny things happen"", just one groups of persons trying to live and chill out while doing the farmer life in a village.  This shows is why Na PD got a TV daesang this year."

koreanvariety,37azkn,xdestry,2,Tue May 26 11:11:20 2015 UTC,"He originally has kind of a silly personality. That's a fact but there's also that rumor going around that because he doesn't know how to ""properly"" speak in public, his agency doesn't let him go on variety that much. True or not, the dude is just funny in spite of himself lol"
koreanvariety,37azkn,WishedChronicles,3,Tue May 26 12:42:02 2015 UTC,I do remember seeing him on Running Man one time.  He was the spy in that one.  And he had to use a water gun to get cast members out during the missions.

koreanvariety,3795o2,WADDAFKXXD,16,Mon May 25 22:01:44 2015 UTC,"I think it's advised but I wouldn't go out your way to do it, since its a gameshow type program, its easy to enjoy and the games are explained on the spot too.  The downside is that there are a lot of inside jokes, member nicknames and member history that get brought up throughout episodes.  These aren't hard to find out or pick up but you might be confused at the time.  Also there are a lot of idol episodes which might be of interest depending on your bias."
koreanvariety,3795o2,Kairoro,10,Mon May 25 22:51:01 2015 UTC,I started off skipping around random episodes just to watch a particular guest. But after a while I decided to start from episode 1 all the way to current and I have no regrets. It was a blast. This is an amazing cast and it was worth getting to know them and watch them develop their relationships with each other as the show goes on. Do ittt
koreanvariety,3795o2,blarrrgo,2,Tue May 26 01:02:33 2015 UTC,"Same, I would watch the episodes when I knew the guests because I had no idea who any of the cast members were. But the more I watched it, the more I loved the members. I started watching episodes with guests I didn't know and realized that they were good, sometimes better, and then I started watching episodes where there were no guests and my goodness, they were the best. I ended up just watching them all from the first episode. The show is still good without liking the members, but once you know the members it just builds the entire atmosphere and makes it so much better."
koreanvariety,3795o2,khandiments,15,Thu May 28 02:54:05 2015 UTC,"If you have lots of free time, I would really recommend so. The first thirty or fifty episodes from 1 are probably a great deal of the better episodes."
koreanvariety,3795o2,okayAlright_,7,Mon May 25 22:07:15 2015 UTC,I think most people would agree that the first 100 episodes are the best ones.
koreanvariety,3795o2,IClurker,1 point,Tue May 26 08:14:33 2015 UTC,yeah me too
koreanvariety,3795o2,kyoza,1 point,Wed May 27 10:26:15 2015 UTC,So true! Esp. the first 40-something episodes:  Song Joong Ki and Lizzy were really great
koreanvariety,3795o2,joshuamontell,5,Sun May 31 12:05:23 2015 UTC,"Starting from the beginning is probably the best way to go so you can see the show and cast members really develop, but it won't really cause any confusion to start from a random episode."
koreanvariety,3795o2,rikaaah,3,Mon May 25 22:27:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I just rewatched an early episode the other day. There were some problems obviously because it was such an early one, but it was also amazing. By watching the early episodes you will learn what makes the show great. Or maybe you'll learn that you don't like it and stop watching. You'll also be able to understand in-jokes and references in later episodes so that you can fully appreciate them."
koreanvariety,3795o2,apreche,3,Tue May 26 00:24:49 2015 UTC,"Go ahead, it doesn't hurt! However, if you tend to skip some bits, there are lots of memories, flashbacks and inside jokes."
koreanvariety,3795o2,razorleague,8,Tue May 26 06:27:33 2015 UTC,I would say it's safe to start around episode 10 and up.  first few episodes the cast didn't have the chemistry and the guests were eh.
koreanvariety,3795o2,firelion,2,Mon May 25 22:17:42 2015 UTC,If you have access to them just start from the beginning and watch them all.  Don't feel like you need to hurry.  Just enjoy the ride at your own pace.
koreanvariety,3795o2,DFu4ever,2,Tue May 26 00:38:37 2015 UTC,"I watched a few random eps at first that were ranked as super funny, but then I decided to start from the beginning and glad i did! It's been awesome and even the weak eps are still good enough to watch. I took me two years to get to ep200 though! :P"
koreanvariety,3795o2,cubivore,2,Tue May 26 04:55:05 2015 UTC,"I watched like 2 or so random eps before I started watching from ep 1 in May of last year. It took me like 10 months to go through em all, but it was definitely a decision I'd do again, and would strongly recommend.   It's not like the newest eps go out of date or anything."
koreanvariety,3795o2,moocaten,2,Tue May 26 05:03:33 2015 UTC,"Yes, it is better, you get to see how the show evolved and how the cast members evolved and got their current characters"
koreanvariety,3795o2,Reyvaan,2,Tue May 26 10:59:09 2015 UTC,"If you already a fan of running man, then i recommend to watch it from episode 1, but if you are still not a fan then choose episode with the guest you like.  like other have said, it really doesn't matter if you watch it from the middle or from beginning since it's a game show program. but a true fan will watch it from episode 1 to see how the members progressed  i still remember running man is the one that introduce me to korean music/show and got me addicted to the show. i think the first episode i watch when the guest is girls generation (ep63-64), my sister recommend it since i got bored with nothing to watch. and at that time i don't even know girls generation, but after that episode which make me laugh out loud several times, i started to download and watch from episode 1,  i even watch in the highest from available format possible (1080p), shame right now no group release 1080p running man anymore"
koreanvariety,3795o2,JakeMit,3,Wed May 27 08:01:03 2015 UTC,"If you have unlimited time, go ahead. Early Running Man episodes take a little bit to get going, but they have some of the best episodes! What I would suggest however is approaching it one of two ways.       If you like Kpop/Kdramas/Kmovies, find an episode with a Guest(s) that you really like! Here is a list of all episodes and the guests for each one. (Warning!!! The right side of that list has the winners of each episode. Make sure to shield your eyes so that you are not spoiled.) 2.If you are new to Korean media and don't have any favorite actors/singers, or if you are not interested in them and are just in it for that sweet variety goodness, I would suggest chronologically watching generally agreed upon ""good episodes"". There are tons of articles that talk about the best Running Man episodes. Here are a few. If you go about it this way, you can see the relatuionships that happen between the cast members such as the Monday Couple or the Easy Brothers!   These are just a couple ways to go about getting into Running Man, and I dont think there is any ""right"" way to go about it, just jump in and enjoy the ride! Personally I started with Episode 63-64 SNSD Couple Race and I was hooked from the start! Have fun!"
koreanvariety,3795o2,HorcruxDestroyer,2,Mon May 25 22:39:15 2015 UTC,"I think it might help to watch the first year (episodes 1-52) of episodes, as it will help familiarize you with not only how the members' relationships and personas were developed, but also how the show's format evolved.   I consider the first 25 episodes or so the ""classic"" era of the show and a must-watch.  After that point you can skip around and skip a lot.  (note that if you're watching on Dramafever, the numbering is offset by 90 episodes--that is, Episode 1 is actually Episode 90--since Dramafever didn't start subbing RM until then)."
koreanvariety,3795o2,mikejonas,2,Tue May 26 03:01:25 2015 UTC,"Dramafever has all of them, including 1-90 as you state, on their youtube channel.   Running man (Korean show): http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLtfqS0HuW35NbcFtHxVAj_9s1cgZSjXMs  This is the playlist in chronological order."
koreanvariety,3795o2,sweetfrown,0,Tue May 26 07:18:01 2015 UTC,"That's because they acquired the fansubbed 1-89 from the late, great iSubs Squad.  On the DF website and its streaming channels, the renumbering remains."
koreanvariety,3795o2,mikejonas,1 point,Tue May 26 12:37:57 2015 UTC,I know it seems like a lot of episodes BUT trust me it's nothing compared to IC or 2D1N. It's SO funny. Start from episode 1
koreanvariety,3795o2,DaltonSooHoo,1 point,Tue May 26 02:38:33 2015 UTC,"I got into it watching eps with my biases guesting, then eventually when I got into RM itself, I would just watch eps with guests I knew. Eventually I just filled in the blanks and now I just keep up with new episodes."
koreanvariety,3795o2,kvlasco,2,Tue May 26 03:43:17 2015 UTC,I would start from episode 2 since episode 1 is really tense with hyori picking on the guest. They probably took her out because they didn't want other female guests to be scared to come on the show. Best decision ever because Ji Hyo is way better than her.
koreanvariety,3795o2,AnneofSeoul,1 point,Tue May 26 04:05:05 2015 UTC,"Hyori is the first guest because she is great at variety shows. She is probably the second biggest factor why Family Outing was so successful (aside from YJS). Hyori was awesome and she acted how players should be in a gameshow (i.e. trying hard to win and not just half-assing it and go for the lolz). KJK also showed how physical name tag tearing can get.   After that, instead of tweaking the rules to make the show competitive and at the same time funny, RM production made the show partially scripted instead to tone down overly competitive behavior (which is stupid considering you are a gameshow), which led to a lot of awkward and illogical moments during the first quarter or so of RM.  The show started to develop better games about halfway through the series when they stopped forcing traitor mechanics, eased up a bit on scripts, and stopped including chase games every single episode."
koreanvariety,3795o2,themadbat,1 point,Tue May 26 12:05:01 2015 UTC,I always get comments like this for stating an opinion. I still think Hyori was too aggressive and has been for many other instances. My opinion stands that I'm glad she left.
koreanvariety,3795o2,AnneofSeoul,0,Tue May 26 14:20:30 2015 UTC,"Hyori was a guest too, though. She was never a part of the cast."
koreanvariety,3795o2,DrJeremiahOrange,2,Tue May 26 04:55:52 2015 UTC,I guess I assumed they were considering a permanent female member since Ji Hyo stayed.
koreanvariety,3789al,hubwub,15,Mon May 25 18:10:48 2015 UTC,"Kwang Soo & Gary saved this episode, amazing chemistry today"
koreanvariety,3789al,Warlord_X,10,Mon May 25 18:32:28 2015 UTC,I wish LKS & Gary were paired up more. Can't remember the last time that duo was in an episode. Cool callback to include Running Balls in the plot line.
koreanvariety,3789al,icanbeyourzero,2,Mon May 25 22:39:39 2015 UTC,So was the episode not very good? :/  Maybe it'll be nice to temper my expectations a bit haha I've enjoyed pretty much all of them recently so maybe I need to lower it for today
koreanvariety,3789al,blockdmyownshot,5,Mon May 25 19:27:12 2015 UTC,only 2 mini games so short with so many guests aswell :(
koreanvariety,3789al,pcgamer99,3,Tue May 26 06:26:01 2015 UTC,"yeah i was surprised, i was like ""oh, it's done"""
koreanvariety,3789al,aznanimedude,4,Tue May 26 18:19:52 2015 UTC,"It depends on how you look at it. Without giving too much away, our cast members and guests were pushed to their limits in regards to one or two fears. I on the other hand enjoyed the show even without subs and I had watched it right after it aired on Sunday."
koreanvariety,3789al,kyopda,7,Mon May 25 21:11:09 2015 UTC,"It was nice to watch the cast do their best and rejoice/despair on their test on luck. Surely, punishments bring real reactions from the members and urge them to do their best than gold or other lavish rewards. That was something I missed for a time."
koreanvariety,3789al,kelsey_anne123,7,Mon May 25 22:21:32 2015 UTC,I can't believe they actually crossed the river! People usually train for months to do that kind of thing. I liked this episode!
koreanvariety,3789al,Wilbii,5,Mon May 25 22:43:43 2015 UTC,The flippers really help out a lot when swimming.  And the wet suits add a little bit of buoyancy.

koreanvariety,3789al,deoxix,1 point,Wed May 27 05:51:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah, they should have done a two weeks special with 2/3 more games the next time. That resolves also how almost everybody could be chosen at the end with the same possibility."
koreanvariety,3789al,sportsteambfan,3,Sat May 30 03:36:16 2015 UTC,"Nice to meet you, Maknae PD! You the best! XD  As for this episode, I liked this episode.  I laughed a lot. It's been awhile since a certain concept was featured in the show."
koreanvariety,3789al,kyugi0923,2,Mon May 25 21:53:32 2015 UTC,holy crap I love those extreme punishments
koreanvariety,3789al,BrandCAG,5,Wed May 27 18:13:07 2015 UTC,"Holy crap this episode was amazing. The cast and the guests were amazing. And finally, running man had gone back to just doing simple games with rewards and punishments which I love. Whenever Running man has a race for a reward it really doesn't feel like there's anything at stake anymore and the show becomes watching to see who does well in each competition and wastes Running Man's greatest asset which is the cast interaction. This episode was more focused on the cast and guests' reaction to the crazy punishments that the production team had prepared, and it made it so that the desire for victory was a lot more genuine. The episode wasn't about who does better on each game and who wins, but how the cast responds to the rewards and punishment."
koreanvariety,3789al,kyugi0923,3,Mon May 25 23:11:00 2015 UTC,"I enjoyed it as well but it's difficult when so many guests come on the show at once, as it limits the screentime any particular individual gets. I quite like Amber so I was hoping to see a little bit more of her. Still, Gary and Kwang-soo were hilarious and made it a lot of fun to watch."
koreanvariety,3789al,sweetfrown,3,Mon May 25 23:27:32 2015 UTC,"Yeah I don't really like it when there are too many guests also. But given with the amount of guests, I think most of them got decent screentime except for KJK's partner. Also, it is really refreshing to have a guest who WANTS to be partners with Ji Suk Jin and it really looks like Ji Suk Jin really enjoyed himself not being relegated as last pick."
koreanvariety,3789al,SarcasticSarcophagus,3,Tue May 26 02:45:21 2015 UTC,"Right?!? I liked that Ji Suk Jin had fun, they were an enjoyable pair"
koreanvariety,3789al,firdausazmi,4,Tue May 26 07:23:39 2015 UTC,"In my opinion, it was only alright. It felt like a 1N2D episode to me rather than a running man episode."
koreanvariety,3789al,dancingmochi,3,Tue May 26 06:23:22 2015 UTC,"I don't know why the production crews keep inviting idols to Running Man. 90% of them were not funny at all especially the girls. They tried really hard to control their coolness and beauty. Running Man is about being funny and being involved in games but after 248 episodes, idols are not relevant enough for this show. Don't get me wrong, I don't hate them just for me, Running Man is not the place for idols."
koreanvariety,3789al,leonora152000,3,Tue May 26 21:18:06 2015 UTC,"Well they wanted to do a foreign celebs special, so it's inevitable they would choose idols. Kangnam was a really good choice for a guest, and the others this episode were also pretty energetic."
koreanvariety,3789al,blarrrgo,2,Wed May 27 06:08:42 2015 UTC,"no, i disagree . They're halyu show so they have to have idols on the show so that we can continue to see trend rising star like Song Jae Rim, Kangnam , Hani ... I like this part of RM too"
koreanvariety,3789al,YJSubs,2,Tue May 26 23:17:33 2015 UTC,"Man if there's one thing I can change about Running Man...it would be those annoying repeat edits of a scene and audio over and over and over and over and over again, lol.  What were those ramen cup noodles that didn't need water? It sounds disgusting but at the same time I wanted to have some because it looked yummy while they were eating it  ...and sooper excited to see Uee back on RM again!"

koreanvariety,3789al,YJSubs,2,Tue May 26 10:55:12 2015 UTC,I find it funnier if they are really scared. It's not much of a punishment if they're enjoying. That whole time watching it made me want to give it a go though.
koreanvariety,3789al,snomanDS,4,Tue May 26 21:38:07 2015 UTC,"Being in the same team, LKS will give really scared reaction, Mong Ji will provide smile reaction, it's a win-win."

koreanvariety,37727s,CKtalon,3,Mon May 25 14:11:59 2015 UTC,"Super cringe... >_<;; But, in fairness to him, the Big Bang episode was a mess because of the format (the entire episode was 1 long chase gameonly).   On his second appearance, it was that dumb ""wizard of oz"" skit that again, was doomed to suck from the start because of convoluted story/script.  I hope they just go for that simple 2-3 fun minigames (NOT acupuncture mats, ddakji, or blind luck games), + 1 elimination game."
koreanvariety,37727s,themadbat,2,Mon May 25 16:39:22 2015 UTC,Mainly RM's fault for not creating a fun and interesting game. Big Bang on Infinite Challenge a few years back when they challenge each other was great.
koreanvariety,37727s,ZoddGutts,3,Tue May 26 21:07:32 2015 UTC,Damn... that IC episode was nearly a disaster because the rules of the game was pretty weak in terms of IC's standards. NHC singlehandedly carried that show because of his one single cheat!
koreanvariety,37727s,themadbat,2,Wed May 27 03:00:03 2015 UTC,"I recently watched that episode, you're so right. It's the members that make it better.   Sometimes when I watch RM or IC I think how about how simplistic the game is but how much fun it becomes after the members make it interesting."
koreanvariety,37727s,khandiments,2,Thu May 28 02:57:00 2015 UTC,I was expecting something better for this episode than BigBang
koreanvariety,37727s,Warlord_X,3,Mon May 25 12:28:53 2015 UTC,"The only thing I vaguely remember from the last BigBang episode was one of their members getting so badly owned in one game (I seem to remember them doing two tag battles), that it was abundantly clear they basically just let him get revenge in a later game to make him look good.  I think it involved Gary.  It was one of the more poorly scripted moments in the show."
koreanvariety,37727s,DFu4ever,9,Mon May 25 13:32:29 2015 UTC,"2 part episode, all chases, and no minigames. It sucked. The episode where it was only GD, Daesung, and Seungri (Princess Ji Hyo episode) was a lot better."

koreanvariety,3746me,mkatter,15,Sun May 24 18:42:59 2015 UTC,"Looking great!   KBS drama The Producers jumps to 11.0%, its highest rating ever (out of 4 episodes total).   Its rating of 10.2% on Friday was only 0.1% lower than SBS's Law of the Jungle.  Law of the Jungle might lose its status as the most watched program in its time slot but its changing scenery next week with new faces and a new location.  MBC My Little Television leaps to 7.3%, its highest rating ever (out of 5 episodes total). A whopping 1.7% improvement over last week.   Jung Joon-young, EXID Hani, and Hong Jin-young made their show debuts, replacing San E, AOA Choa, and Ye Jung-hwa.  MBC I Live Alone gets back into the double digits with 10.5%, first time since February 20 (12.3%).    Since June 6, 2014, it got double digit ratings five times. It also got 9.9% on two separate occasions.     Meh...   KBS Happy Together's Big Bang Special got a rating of 4.6%, the worst rating in the show's 14 year history.    The second worst rating was 4.7%, which happened 3 weeks ago on April 30. This was the episode with Amber, Henry, Jinusean, Kim Yong Chul, and Jung Sung Hwa. The third worst rating was 5.0%, which happened three times in the past 3 months (May 14, April 9, March 12) and once on November 27, 2014.  For the past year, since May 29, 2014, Happy Together consistently achieved ratings around 5.5~6.5%. It went higher than 7.0% ten times, peaking at 9.6%. Some media sources incorrectly said that the show has a 16 year history. None of them made the correction and sites like Netizenbuzz and Allkpop parroted the same mistake. Happy Together started 14 years ago on November 8, 2001. 16 years ago, there was a drama on SBS also called Happy Together, which is what they incorrectly looked up.  Fellow Thursday night program, MBC's Police 2015, achieved its worst rating (3.0%) in its 4th episode.  MBC We Got Married gets 3.0% for the third time in the past five weeks. 3.0% is the worst rating in WGM Season 4 history, which started on November 15, 2012.   WGM's woes hit headlines when it dropped from 4.8% to season low 3.1% on April 11. Since then, it hit a new record of 3.0% on April 25, May, 2, and May 23.  Oh! My Baby also dropped heavily on April 11, from 6.4% to 4.7%. Unlike WGM, it at least improved over the following weeks (5.3 / 5.1 / 5.0 / 4.8 / 5.6).   The last episode of SBS Law of the Jungle in Indochina resulted in its lowest rating of ""only"" 10.3%. There's nothing to worry about here.   Debut   KBS Human Condition 3 started off with a 2.9% rating.   Not much of an improvement over Season 2, which got 3.8, 2.9, 3.2, 2.8, 3.3% in its last 5 episodes. However, Season 3's broadcast starts at 11:45 PM, instead of 11:15 PM. Mixed reviews. It seems to be better than Season 2 but worse than Season 1.  A lot of people are dubious about the whole idea of rooftop farming. There's a lot of concerns (air pollution in cities, putting soil on top of cement, which also has paint on it, how to water the crops, structural concerns with the cement and the building itself due to water/weight, etc.) I guess we'll see how they'll address these problems (or not...).    Upcoming   SBS Law of the Jungle in Yap starts next week. Yap is an island in the western Pacific Ocean, east of the Philippines and north of New Guinea. It's a part of the Caroline Islands, which is a part of Micronesia.  tvN The Genius Season 4's first episode will be on June 27, replacing SNL Korea Season 6.   SNL Korea Season 6 is not being cancelled nor is the season ending. The show will make improvements to its skits and crew during the downtime while The Genius airs. SNL Korea will resume when The Genius ends. Source: OSEN (in Korean)  KBS's pilot program Looking Back at Myself (나를 돌아봐) will become a regular program.   It will replace The Producers (Fri/Sat 9:15 PM) or Orange Marmalade (Fri 10:35 PM). The specific date and the time has not been determined.  KBS's Lady Action (레이디 액션) is in talks of being turned into a regular program. If Lady Action also gets the green light, it will compete with Looking Back At Myself for the same time slots.

koreanvariety,3746me,dreamraine,6,Sun May 24 18:55:37 2015 UTC,"Oh, it should also be noted that Monday May 25 is a national holiday (Buddha's birthday). As a result, some of the low ratings on Fri/Sat/Sun could be attributed to people enjoying the extended weekend. This also means that the programs that held their ground or increased their ratings did a phenomenal job...like KBS's Happy Sunday (particularly 1 Night 2 Days)."

They need to add 2 more regular casts, since they've become too predictable. They started with 9 anyway. Only a handful of guests for 5 years have done RM as RM should be done. As much as I want seeing my favorite artists on the show, If they're not doing anything new anyway, my view of them just gets lower.  People are better off viewing only selected entertaining clips of episodes on social media."

koreanvariety,374qrj,Jynxette,3,Sun May 24 21:31:03 2015 UTC,I've been watching it without subs and its pretty fun.  The latest episode gave me mixed feelings. I totally agree with the mom about how her kid should be healthy/having fun at that age instead of studying 24/7. I didn't like how almost everyone voted to send her to a hagwon though I can understand why they did.

koreanvariety,374qrj,pokeiman,2,Mon May 25 16:24:35 2015 UTC,"I was sent to hakwon when I was little as well. I remember it started even before I entered elementary school. It was awful. Not the environment or classmates, the fact that I had to study when the kids in my neighborhood were playing hide and seek, and the pressure that my mom pushed upon me, caused me to pull my hair off. And look at me now, more than a decade later and I'm just an average student. When I have kids, I'll never send them to hakwon. After I die, I'll play for the rest of my entire next life."

koreanvariety,36yrph,pokeiman,18,Sat May 23 06:45:02 2015 UTC,"I love it!! Very fresh and interesting for a korean drama. A welcome change to the stereotypical dramas that dominate Korean television. I mean..how many more times can you do the boy-saves-girl City Hunter/Healer?  The mockumentary style is very experimental which may have put traditional Korean viewers off but its really hitting its stride now and becoming more popular. The actors are great too, which is a massive bonus."
koreanvariety,36yrph,Hyperion98,3,Sat May 23 08:32:38 2015 UTC,I like it quite a bit! Looking forward to more Soo Hyun and IU interaction :)
koreanvariety,36yrph,HorcruxDestroyer,3,Sat May 23 08:16:18 2015 UTC,Episode three with the director change was a good alteration. It's shaping up to be much more entertaining. They're going to likely pull a Reply 1997 and wait til the very end to reveal which couples pair off. I'm still hoping for Soohyun and Hyojin.

koreanvariety,36yrph,JonghyunRAWRS,2,Sat May 23 11:10:11 2015 UTC,"i do!   i don't always watch k-drama but since it's variety-themed drama, i decided to give it a shot. and after watching first 2 eps, i love it. fresh style than your usual generic romcom drama, i love modern family - arrested development - the office which are in similar style of the producer (mockumentary). looking forward for next episodes."
koreanvariety,36yrph,natcookie,2,Sat May 23 12:25:49 2015 UTC,"I didn't love the first episode, but this week's episodes (3 & 4) met my expectations for the show, though I still don't really know where the story is going.

koreanvariety,36wrf7,naiku,5,Sat May 23 00:12:20 2015 UTC,"Well.. KwangHee starting to blend naturally with the other members, which is great. And this episode was not 100% about him anymore like the previous one.  I don't know if anyone will agree but he really is the best choice among the other 5. Even compared to JDM which was the strongest candidate before. Think about it, they won't be able to make episodes like this with Siwon, Jang Dong Min or Hong Jin Kyung as the 6th..."
koreanvariety,36wrf7,ginastringr,3,Sat May 23 01:06:23 2015 UTC,"Whether you like him or not, you cannot deny his effort. Whenever there are talking gag scenes (e.g. rebellious guy, what did you learn), he tries his hardest to contribute. I also love it that during this episode, there is a lot less talks about his plastic surgery, which is the default when he got nothing to say."
koreanvariety,36wrf7,themadbat,2,Sun May 24 03:02:28 2015 UTC,Is it just me or timing of sub is a little off? Does anyone know how to fix that?

koreanvariety,36wrf7,lupin88,6,Sat May 23 00:12:31 2015 UTC,myungsoo was the star in both this episode and last episode
koreanvariety,36wrf7,themadbat,2,Fri May 22 23:43:11 2015 UTC,Myungsoo always delivers! His comedy works so well with the IC gang because of the years they have been together.
koreanvariety,36wrf7,MyPasswordisnotEZ,2,Sat May 23 02:19:26 2015 UTC,I'm with you. He had me dying during the tug o' war. He has definitely been giving it his all recently
koreanvariety,36wrf7,Enter_Text_Here,2,Sat May 23 17:45:51 2015 UTC,Myungsoo carried the last two episodes so hard.  I hope Jaesuk will influence Kwanghee to go to the gym and eat more :).
koreanvariety,36wrf7,Hyperion98,2,Sat May 23 14:59:14 2015 UTC,I thought Kwang Hee was the stand out with his body gag.
koreanvariety,36wrf7,syoobb,3,Sat May 23 06:00:36 2015 UTC,Very impressed with Kwanghee again... truly beginning to blend in. TEO PD showing his brilliance again with the way he is slowly assimilating KH into the group... last episode was centered around him and this episode is more about his interactions with the members.

I really didn't know  sits on couch  JSJ - You had to see his expression when he first found out  LKS - oh my god I really didn't know...  PD - We'll prepare for the live broadcast now  LKS - (stands) what do you mean prepare for live broadcast? Get out, what are you doing? This is my house.  JSJ - Look at this. (Reading tv subtitles) In the case Kwang Soo realizes it's a hidden camera, all prize money goes to him.  up until 1:50, more exclamations of how he didn't know what was going on  1:52~  LKS - Wow it became Happy KwangSoo Hidden Camera  JSJ - Yea it changed from Happy Kwangsoo Day to Happy Kwangsoo Hidden Camera Day  LKS - I didn't know T_T  JSJ - It's okay, you're the main character!  LKS - What do you mean main character?!  lights are shown, 2:09  LKS - So everyone knew?  JSJ - Completely everyone  LKS - I'm really going to break a camera. I'm gonna break all the lights.  showing final scene with LKS and JSJ  YJS - Ahh typical KwangSoo  JSJ - Yep that's the Kwang Soo we know. I saw you [rub the liquid on your hand]  LKS - Ah you saw that?!  JSJ - I saw it!  LKS - Oh god I didn't know  kwangsoo screams/wails  JSJ - I was looking away on purpose  LKS - (while wailing) I'm so embarrassed...  JSJ - Look at me laugh because I'm so happy  2:50  YJS - Man we suddenly have to do a live broadcast. It was decided today.  JSJ - Who knew we'd do a live broadcast.   YJS/JSJ - Look (points to TV) it says live broadcast with lee kwang soo soon. We're really going to be on TV in a second  JSJ - Here it comes  LKS - Oh I'm nervous...  JSJ - So our faces are going to be right on the tv as we speak right?  YJS - Yes we'll be shown live  3:05  YJS - (I'm not entirely sure what he says but I think it's...) I might talk about me more than you. Don't be surprised. I really like live broadcasts.  Afterwords that broadcast is subbed on the running man ep so I won't bother."

They are essentially thieves. Steal the work of other subbers and then take payment for a VIP service which then is delayed everytime.  I used to remember when subbing was for the fans by the fans, not a thing to be abused by greedy people.  (i have nothing against vip fan subbing service, but then it has to be VIP, were talking about within 10 hours from release full 720p encoded hardsubbed videos uplaoded to multiple free download servers, not steal a viet sub translate in google translate and release it over 48 hours later)"

Henry and Amber are always awesome. He spent 600 for seaweed and a coat haha. Awesome  Jinusean are so interesting. I love how carefree they are now and just enjoy performing.

koreanvariety,36qf2f,TweetsInCommentsBot,5,Thu May 21 08:42:05 2015 UTC,"I read that the TG team would be putting emphasis on casting non-entertainers (i.e. the public), given the good showing by Oh Hyunmin, Choi Yeonseung and Kim Yoohyun. I did not recall reading any updates about a public casting, so I wonder if they would pick from the pot left from S3's public casting.  For return cast, my personal choice would be Lee Junseok (eliminated in S1E1 and guested on S2E9). I was impressed by his shrewd play in S2E9. However, his political position (he holds a leadership position in the S.Korean President's party) could bring sensitivity and tension to TG if not managed well.   If they are casting actors, I would love to see Shin Sungrok for his sinister vibe in the Korean version of ""Liar Game"". However, I've not seen him in variety so I don't know how he'll do.  Since Jang Jin did well in Crime Scene, movie directors might be a possible consideration."

That was because the country has been very hermetic for decades but now they're opening to these new shows, start to show interest to show them to foreigners (although their huge market is completely enough) and can use their gigantic piles of money and resources to do things korean varieties can dream of (and that's the reason why they will become more popular than korean varieties has been). In some sense being this huge country and with their recent economic advance this was going to happen anytime.   Some others say this is the korean entertainment expanding to China, but i think this is China slowly eating what they can of them, like with the chinese guys of EXO. They are grown there and then go to China. Of course there still will be a lot of tv shows here but the great ideas and super productions will be more likely to happen there."
koreanvariety,36ng2b,0moe,3,Wed May 20 17:59:06 2015 UTC,"I really don't see China becoming a soft power leader anytime soon. Their image is pretty bad across the entire world, especially in other Asian countries. They have to dig themselves out of a deep hole first before they can even think about exporting culture."
koreanvariety,36ng2b,sportsteambfan,4,Thu May 21 07:51:31 2015 UTC,"I'm honestly not worried. For a long time now, America has taken in a ton of talent from other English speaking countries due to the higher pay and those countries still make great art. At the end of the day, this was inevitable since the Chinese market is so much bigger than the Korean market."
koreanvariety,36ng2b,femacca,0,Wed May 20 20:00:30 2015 UTC,Where is the problem? China deserves better TV shows. Have you seen the crap they show on tv? Its third class at best like everything else you can buy in china. They deserve better.
koreanvariety,36ng2b,mkatter,5,Wed May 20 21:26:32 2015 UTC,"Honestly, the thing that will hold China back the most in the long run is censorship. A lot of things can't get made since it won't pass the censors. It's hard to discuss mature themes when you are limited in such a fashion."

I think they were appropriately scaled for difficulty and time constraint - Joonyoung's was pretty easy but he had to go the furthest. The performance of Fantasie-Impromptu was amazing, I can't believe she did that after just ten minutes of practice and years after first playing it."

koreanvariety,36jkn6,Wilbii,3,Thu May 21 13:31:04 2015 UTC,the 2 episodes before this episode are hilarious. if you want recommendations for episodes to watch I would say start from the seollal in seoul part 1 and move up the kbs playlist. The bond the cast has was solidified from these episodes.

koreanvariety,36il67,GooYo,3,Tue May 19 17:33:41 2015 UTC,More then likely they'll have a revenge show or make Kwangsoo believe it's a revenge show just to be fooled again. Running Man likes to keep themes like these but they only appear once a year at the most.
koreanvariety,36il67,Hitokiri2,2,Wed May 20 02:32:32 2015 UTC,they could do an episode for him like the one they did for suk jin where the members had to help him win
koreanvariety,36il67,beadybanter,-3,Tue May 19 19:19:18 2015 UTC,I thought he deserved to lose. The producers have given him many chances to be in the spotlight. He just doesn't have the brains to pull one over the members and always crack under pressure. He's been a spy many times and is always ousted before he completes his mission.
koreanvariety,36il67,Enter_Text_Here,9,Tue May 19 18:46:11 2015 UTC,It's a variety show. Have some laughs

koreanvariety,36il67,aokijie,2,Tue May 19 18:50:37 2015 UTC,"That's why they gave him the chance to break away from his betraying habits in this recent episode. As soon as the hint about the solo win was given to him, his eyes changed."
koreanvariety,36il67,Enter_Text_Here,2,Tue May 19 18:57:11 2015 UTC,"If he break from it, he will lose one of his most popular character. It'll be pretty dumb for the show scriptwriter or kwang soo to change it."
koreanvariety,36il67,aokijie,1 point,Tue May 19 18:59:58 2015 UTC,"Even if he has a revenge episode, knowing him, he will just fail because that's his persona. He only has a chance of success if someone helps him but that would defeat the purpose."

koreanvariety,36bb48,kamenridertag,9,Mon May 18 18:58:03 2015 UTC,"The blurring may have been because of the pirated movies (I also noticed ""Gangster Squad,"" at least two ""Star Wars"" films, and ""Rust and Bone""). The folder name that wasn't blurred in that segment could have had something to do with porn or could have just been focused on because that weird folder name.  Regarding actual porn, in the articles like this one: http://www.soompi.com/2015/05/17/ji-suk-jin-finds-nsfw-material-on-lee-kwang-soos-computer-in-running-man/ it was mentioned that SJ had found a NSFW videos in the recycle bin, which we didn't see since that blurred portion took place in the list of ""Recent Places."""
koreanvariety,36bb48,amelisa28,1 point,Mon May 18 22:25:22 2015 UTC,i might be wrong but i'm fairly sure that when they talk about NSFW videos they might not necessary be talking about porn.  It could easily be rated R movies with nudity.
koreanvariety,36bb48,RyuNoKami,3,Mon May 18 22:52:00 2015 UTC,I think they just blur out movies. They've done it previously as well

I didn't want him to win exactly but having him catch on a little would have been more fun, or their missions at least being even a little bit difficult.  I guess I thought most of the interactions were fine but the games and theme was poorly done. Entertaining but zero excitement."
koreanvariety,36bb48,NoCount,2,Tue May 19 05:45:28 2015 UTC,Yeah imagine if LKS knew the hidden camera the whole time and just played along. I kept thinking that would have been a nice twist for a change.

Obviously if you're trying to suprise someone you're not gonna tell them the full details. Kwangsoo's manager could tell him that someone's gonna visit him but doesn't know the exact time or date that's why when he opened the door to check who rang the doorbell he just thought it was someone else not the running man crew.

Season 3 cast members: Musicians Yoon Jong Shin and Jo Jung Chi, celebrity chefs Choi Hyun Seok and Jung Chang Wook, comedians Jung Tae Ho and Park Sung Kwang.  The new season will revolve around rooftop urban farming. Source: NewsWay (in Korean)."

Three Meals A Day performed so well. PD Nah did such a good job of boosting the standing and rating of cable variety shows."

On May 13, Hidden Singer 4 revealed this graphic on its official website and on its Facebook page. Basically, it's calling for people to tryout for the show.     Example list of artists you can tryout for. The list isn't all-inclusive. There can be rematches against artists that appeared on Seasons 1 through 3. You can also tryout for artists that passed away, like the Kim Kwang Suk episode."

koreanvariety,369bfo,dreamraine,1 point,Tue May 19 13:16:54 2015 UTC,"Thanks ! It's not a high quality drama though, it's parody drama.

koreanvariety,369bfo,fuklief,2,Tue May 19 15:19:32 2015 UTC,"watched it already...some jokes were dated, but still funny! Ok, will check it out"
koreanvariety,369dyu,deoxix,13,Sun May 17 13:31:03 2015 UTC,"I love this season's cast so much, they got better in finding clues/evidences now and their chemistry is on point.   I am so not ready for this show to end. Each case just keeps getting better and better!"
koreanvariety,369dyu,Bananauyu,15,Sun May 17 16:56:36 2015 UTC,"2nd season is definitely much better than the 1st season. One of the main reasons is that the cast is given more time to prepare their roles, so they are more immersed in them, and it really shows during the cases. The cases are better thought out in season 2 also...I felt in season one, some of the motives were quite shallow. But in S2, all the killer's motives have been solid.   And finally, S1's first guest is Henry Lau, while S2's first guest is Kim Jinhoon....the contrast in quality is already evident!!!!  As for the cast, I do like S1's cast as well...except that Park Jiyoon was pulling off some queen bee act on the lawyer which I found uncomfortable to a certain extent....But I do have a soft spot for Season 2 cast...and Jang Jin is a hidden gem!"
koreanvariety,369dyu,dreamraine,9,Sun May 17 16:53:48 2015 UTC,"yeah i'm so glad that they cast jang jin for this, he's a hidden gem indeed. i even thought he should be in the genius 4 (wishful thinking)  kim jihoon and xiumin did really well as guests, i'm actually sad when they don't join anymore. tbh i'm sceptical abt xiumin guesting since he's there for raising ratings, but i'm glad that he can show his stellar play.  as for casts, not gonna lie i still miss jun hyunmoo though i love all season 2 casts"
koreanvariety,369dyu,natcookie,9,Sun May 17 17:53:11 2015 UTC,"i love when jang jin does some random funnies, like when he was trying to speak english once: ""she was perfect"""
koreanvariety,369dyu,rsxstock,5,Sun May 17 19:53:15 2015 UTC,"Not only do the cases get more exciting after each episode, but I am just absolutely blown away by Jang Jin's progress this season."
koreanvariety,369dyu,hybridfantIII,4,Tue May 19 00:09:06 2015 UTC,"The casting worked amazingly well. The characters and abilities of S1's Jinho and Jiyoon and S2's Dongmin, Jang Jin and Hani were different and charming in their own way, and made up for each other well.   It also helped that the guests were given a longer stint (save for the beauty queen). Kim Ji Hoon and Xiumin were more comfortable with the cast, which showed in their performances, banter and overall chemistry that made the show entertaining.   Giving the cast and guests their roles in advance made wonders. They had more time to immerse and became comfortable with their new identities and thus could play a cooler hand during filming. The whole show became less nonsensical and took on a more serious note, which the show deserved, while not compromising on the entertainment level."
koreanvariety,369dyu,femacca,7,Mon May 18 04:52:07 2015 UTC,"Season 2 is just awesome. Mind-blowingly awesome. Be it the cases, the cast (love the new members, especially Dongmin), the guests, the structure of the show (glad the producers didn't stick with the structure used in ep2) or the newly added detective role. This season also has a better reward system, unlike in season 1 where everyone had to put all their gold on the line for the final case. spoiler  Speaking of reward system, these are the amount of money earned by each member as of ep7: spoiler  Definitely looking forward to the rest of the season; more shocking plot twists, more breaking-of-character moments, more of Dongmin screaming at people, more of Jiyoon's acting, more mispronounced words from Jinho, more of easily scared Hani and finally, more triangular deductions from Jang Jin!"
koreanvariety,369dyu,YellOw_Crown,3,Sun May 17 19:38:08 2015 UTC,Jiyoon needs to step it up this season. She have been missing the points.
koreanvariety,369dyu,404feelings,3,Mon May 18 02:19:13 2015 UTC,"Her best performance came from spoiler But this is still short of her brilliance in S1. However, I think she had sort of given up being the best in this season, but focussed on becoming more entertaining instead. Less pressure that way, I guess? Look at how her stylist character fussed over her favourite dancer oppa and Jazz Park sashaying with Fly Me To The Moon, haha."
koreanvariety,369dyu,femacca,3,Mon May 18 04:43:22 2015 UTC,"I agree Jiyoon kinda gave up being the best too, ditching her deduction queen title lol. But now I love the way she portrayed her characters, adding humour to every episode."
koreanvariety,369dyu,YellOw_Crown,3,Mon May 18 10:09:07 2015 UTC,"and when she tried having the miss korea voice then was like ""ugh i'm just going to talk in my normal voice"""
koreanvariety,369dyu,aznanimedude,3,Thu May 21 17:27:57 2015 UTC,"I think the two things that have stood out for me comparing Season 1 and Season 2 have to be the cast and the creative direction of the crimes.  Cast: Not much to say here that hasn't already been said, but Jiyoon and Jinho were perfect to keep, and Hani, Jang Jin and Dongmin were all perfect additions. Guests have been pretty on point as well. New cast seems to have much stronger chemistry and banter than Season 1, though that group had their charms as well.  Crimes: Damn good stuff here. Double murder? I really liked the last few cases. Transgender murder (which was accurately guessed), Xiumin as criminal twice and actually getting away with it the second time? The creativity and red herrings are just off the charts this year, and I'm really looking forward to next week's with how intense the buildup was."
koreanvariety,369dyu,MetaEdgeSpiral,3,Sun May 17 21:16:30 2015 UTC,"its just me or not, i hate when cast member touch the victims body without glove but overall i enjoy this season 2 !"
koreanvariety,369dyu,kyoza,2,Thu May 21 09:01:10 2015 UTC,great season so far. The cast is great at deductions but they also play off each other well now that they are comfortable with each other and it's a lot of fun to watch. The writers are also more willing to do more crazy stories now too that they have a better handle on the show.
koreanvariety,369dyu,sportsteambfan,2,Sun May 17 22:53:18 2015 UTC,The cases are interesting and the prop/set quality is wayyyy higher this season. The one thing I am disappointed about is that not many of these cases are based on real murder cases and therefore seem to be a little less realistic than the crimes from season one.
koreanvariety,369dyu,purofound_leadah,2,Thu May 21 13:28:31 2015 UTC,One thing i have to point is that they're doing really more creative things this time such as the double murder in the entertainment company. Props to being that elaborate.
koreanvariety,369dyu,dattroll123,2,Sun May 17 20:15:39 2015 UTC,"It has been a great season so far, much better than season 1.  At first I worried that this show will get repetitive, but the producers have managed to add new twists to keep it fresh.  Hani and Jang Jin are a surprise to me. I didn't expect Hani to do this well in finding clues and making correct deductions.  She really puts the effort into finding clues, even ditching the heels for more comfortable footwear to make clue searching easier. Also gotta like Jang Jin's triangular theories, which are either completely spot on or way off the mark lol."

koreanvariety,364j7i,potatokaiser,6,Sat May 16 01:50:55 2015 UTC,"2nd episode was better.  The humor is starting to get good, ""Your 1st choice was Yoo Hee Yeol Sketchbook?  You are assigned to Let's Go Dreamteam."" LOL  I didn't realize Kim Jong Kook was acting as a PD, I thought he was just doing a parody of himself.  Pinky4 seems like a parody of MissA with IU being Suzy."
koreanvariety,364j7i,dragonaery,3,Sun May 17 02:22:33 2015 UTC,"Agree to that, thought about Suzy and Miss A right away ! The whole show seems to be hinting to actual situations in the real Producing/Variety world."
koreanvariety,364j7i,WishedChronicles,5,Sun May 17 13:35:52 2015 UTC,i started watching and I find it really funny and refreshing! But I guess maybe Korea don't like non-in your face-romances and non-melo stories? Maybe it's because I love K-variety...but I love all the references in the show!
koreanvariety,364j7i,dreamraine,3,Sun May 17 15:25:27 2015 UTC,"I'm seven minutes in and this seems really funny! They made fun of Happy Together ratings, and there's a character called Kim Tae Ho PD, who is a total asshole. ETA: I watched the rest of the episode, and while it wasn't great, I don't think it was as bad as the Korean reaction. There's potential there, I'm going to at least watch the second episode. IU's acting is really awful, though."
koreanvariety,364j7i,divenose,3,Sat May 16 06:54:38 2015 UTC,"i agree with you, watched first 20 minutes and it's good. the reason why this drama isn't received well in SK perhaps because the style is fairly new for SK viewers who are used to general romcom drama style they've watched. meanwhile the producers reminds me w/ the office and modern family (i like both of them) which are documentary-drama style"
koreanvariety,364j7i,natcookie,0,Sun May 17 01:48:56 2015 UTC,"this drama isn't received well in SK because the style is fairly new to SK viewers   It's a bold move, producer, let's see how it plays out."

koreanvariety,364j7i,dreamraine,3,Sun May 17 15:24:18 2015 UTC,There are mixed reviews about this drama. But almost everyone agrees that the second episode was much better than the first. So don't stop at the first episode. I personally thought that it was okay. I might have hyped myself too much for it. It feels like it should get better and better.

koreanvariety,364j7i,deoxix,2,Sun May 17 20:18:01 2015 UTC,"That's why it felt very familiar to me. I just realized that it has that ""The Office"" vibe to it with like BTS Scene or those interview scenes. I actually like it. I will watch it fully though. I enjoyed watching the first episode."

koreanvariety,364j7i,t2t2,3,Sun May 17 07:06:51 2015 UTC,Unfortunately it was poorly received by Korean audiences.
koreanvariety,364j7i,Hyperion98,2,Sat May 16 08:10:38 2015 UTC,"I've finally watched and it wasn't that bad, maybe a bit dull. I liked the behind the scenes look in a goofy world where producers can't get their shit together and have some comical problems because of it. The humor is a bit more dry and from characters that from situation/misunderstandings (that is what i have seen in a couple of comedy dramas) with some cameos and good references to real varieties. I can't understand why many couldn't swallow the show because it's a different special kind of humor and not the dramaland version of the business. Producer is really ""The office"" korean drama edition (that is, a lot less awkward and more drama-like situations).   After watching the first episode i don't really want to see more than another episode really and i have already seen a couple of plots that i think they're going to expand too much so that's it.   TL;DR: Not bad, just a bit dull and experimental. Watch for yourself."

koreanvariety,364j7i,leopetri,1 point,Tue May 19 08:32:47 2015 UTC,"Since I really enjoyed both versions of The Office and other similar styled US and Brit shows in the past, this drama is a bit of a breath of fresh air on the tedious 4 way love triangle formula.  The jokes can be predictable but it's been delivered well. I especially enjoyed Kim Tae Ho PD especially remembering the actor that's playing him had a really funny moment in one of IC's episodes."

koreanvariety,364j7i,sodiumwaste,1 point,Sat May 16 17:04:18 2015 UTC,"That's just netizens being dumbasses and spouting FUD as usual.  Producer received 10.1% and 10.3% viewership for Ep 1 and 2.  The 'winner', 'Dongsang Imong' only got 6.2% viewership, while 'Three meals a day' got 7.89%.  In comparison, Orange Marmalade 3.3% for its first episode.   I'm lazy to check what other shows were up against Producer during that time slot, but 10% ratings at the beginning is not bad.  EDIT: It was 7th (11th overall) for the drama category for the 1st ep, 5th for the 2nd (6th overall) for the whole day."
koreanvariety,364j7i,CKtalon,0,Sun May 17 05:45:09 2015 UTC,"I think for what it is (dry mockumentary style drama) an hour is waaay too long. The Office/Parks&Rec work because you get in and out of the bits almost immediately with a loose thread to pay off later on with your finales and such. If it was 30 minutes imagine how crazy it would of been to see Tae Hyun scolded in the first 2-5 minutes and then eventually afterwards we see why, you gotta' make a good first impression with stuff like this."

One thing i got sorta tired of was the UEE name drops it felt force the character they were trying to give him.  i dont think people should start judging KwangHee yet, im gonna wait til we get a ""real IC"" ep.  This EP and the next are more to introduce him, so naturally hes gonna get tons of air time and people are gonna set him up for laughs. When i said im waiting for a real IC eps i mean a EP where the focus is on the mission and the whole cast rather then just one person. Then we can see how he really fits in with the cast."
koreanvariety,362z6i,llionell,3,Sat May 16 03:59:58 2015 UTC,"Enjoyed this episode a lot! I think Kwanghee will fit in will with the other members. He brings to the table exactly what MuDo needs 10 years into its run: youth and unbridled energy. You can tell already that he is beginning to form his own character and he fits in well with the other cast members despite the age gap. I think JDM's elimination is a blessing in disguise because he would have clashed too much with PMS's character and created disharmony.  Also, Korean audiences seem to have really taken to Kwanghee. The response to this episode was very good."

koreanvariety,362z6i,deoxix,0,Sat May 16 02:52:34 2015 UTC,"Meh, the episode was good but because of the other members. I feel sorry for thinking like this but if anything he looked good because they were redirecting every joke to him and placed him on the spotlight for all the episode but he is still probably months from adapting to the show and we'll see if he can can make himself funny when they cannot cover for him. I laughed a couple of times with him but nothing too special.    As i said for, kwanghee isn't a bad entertainer at all but IC isn't really his style, he is a talk show persona. The rest is hopeful positive thinking. Maybe i'm resenting him a bit too much because, in my opinion, it was a bit disappointing to make a hiper selection of famous entertainers we ended up with him. I wanted a very active person leading a bit of the conversations but now we have to pray he doesn't ends in the shy/is just here role of jun jin/gil."
koreanvariety,362z6i,ginastringr,15,Fri May 15 20:05:02 2015 UTC,"What can you expect? He's still new... and he got a LOT of criticism before this episode. On that state, a normal person won't be able to even smile.  Of course he can't make a comeback joke towards other members. He's scared that other people will think his jokes are overboard. Plus, he still calls the other member sunbaenim... which is very formal. That's why the other members still need to support him, to make him comfortable.  If you think about it, the other 5 candidates might not be able to reach what KwangHee has done in this episode.  I quite enjoyed this episode. Well done KwangHee."
koreanvariety,362z6i,themadbat,3,Sat May 16 00:56:16 2015 UTC,"I agree. The amount of pressure he was in is absurd. Still, he was able to perform well in his first IC appearance. There is one thing I find worrisome though. He seems to be really shy during the hamburger buying scene. He doesn't seem comfortable being silly in a real environment with bystanders. I hope this goes away in future episodes."
koreanvariety,362z6i,knn328,1 point,Sat May 16 17:30:06 2015 UTC,Well said.  Kwanghee is very spontaneous.
koreanvariety,362z6i,CutieButt,2,Sun May 17 11:48:30 2015 UTC,Yeah I feel the same regarding the other members really making this episode great (namely PMS) and not so much Kwanghee. I just hope they don't continue this forced style of propping him in the spotlight and just let things naturally happen.
koreanvariety,362z6i,Supplycrate,6,Fri May 15 21:25:07 2015 UTC,"I agree this episode was mainly the existing members setting him up very well to succeed (although I think he did a good job hitting the jokes they pitched him). Still I understand why they did it this way, it's his first episode and there was a lot of hate directed at him so it's understandable they'd want to get him off to a good start however possible.   I'm pretty sure Tae Ho will only have one episode like this, he's probably very conscious that continuing the Kwang Hee focus will attract criticism very fast. Especially after all the hate the Sixth Man episodes got for being drawn out / putting the existing members in the background."
koreanvariety,362z6i,Enter_Text_Here,-2,Fri May 15 21:57:37 2015 UTC,Not to complain but why does the subbed episode come out so late? Other shows get subbed within 2-3 days and IC is a popular show.
koreanvariety,362z6i,deoxix,5,Fri May 15 18:56:55 2015 UTC,Soompitv finished their contract to have the rights to air IC subbed so we just have dramafever that gets the subs out the next friday.
koreanvariety,362z6i,airogent,8,Fri May 15 19:52:25 2015 UTC,Man... This is heaven compares to the dark age that was just a couple years ago where it was only fan subbed.
koreanvariety,362z6i,brickbane,8,Sat May 16 04:26:26 2015 UTC,d*mmit. You remind me of the period when there is one ep sub per month and that if we're lucky. Looking back I keep wondering how I can stick to IC throughout that time.
koreanvariety,362z6i,airogent,9,Sat May 16 05:17:36 2015 UTC,"It's a great time to live as a Korean variety fan. We got dramafever, hulu, soompitv, KBS world and myriads of fan-subbed contents now. Thats why it grinds my gear a little when I see people complaining that subs are not coming out fast enough."

koreanvariety,362z6i,chillingwithavillain,-1,Sat May 16 02:58:10 2015 UTC,"Wow, that response must have required all of your brain cells to come in cohesive harmony to shit out such a well articulated and efficient response. Its just a suggestion."
koreanvariety,362z6i,polidarida,2,Sat May 16 07:47:20 2015 UTC,"i am not a native english user. so, i did not really bother to write really long opinion. i did not hate siwon as a person. he is doing well in acting but variety just wasn't meant for him. he is funny in small dose but not as a permanent variety cast. plus, siwon didn't constantly do variety shows for those 5years you have mentioned. except suju VS, he just came as guest on other shows. kwanghee is the one who did VS constantly for 5straight years from guesting in the beginning to co-MCing plenty well known shows like knee drop guru and starking.  you can keep your opinion that kwanghee is a one trick pony. but he isn't one. i see plenty his VS. his chemistry with people is just impressive. from idol, gagman to top MC like YJS and KHD, he interact really well. i did not meant that siwon is bad at interacting with people but siwon's interaction is just not meant for broadcasting. i know in real life that he have such big reaction. but that kind of reaction too will cause viewers to feel uncomfortable and disturbed since the other cast is speaking at the same time.  one critical point about kwanghee than siwon is his traits and behaviours. siwon doesn't really have much point to be pick on compared to kwanghee. he is good looking, rich, popular, strong and come from a popular group and company. traits that are definitely not funny to pick on.   p/s : still both kwanghee and siwon benefitted from appearing on mudo."
koreanvariety,362z6i,lupin88,6,Sat May 16 17:10:50 2015 UTC,my other concern is that he hasn't done his military service yet (he's 28 in korean age so he might be drafted soon) so who knows how that'll go. this isn't a HaHa situation since he was one of the earliest members and left after 3 years on the show.   that being said i don't dislike kwanghee but i'd rather much wish this sixth man project never existed
koreanvariety,362z6i,chillingwithavillain,1 point,Sat May 16 17:52:33 2015 UTC,"I feel the exact same way. The sixth man should'nt have been created in the first place but apprantly the amount of members they currently had, at 5; was somehow afflicting the progress of their other projects or not allowing them do well.   I dont see Kwang Hee lasting that long anyway with IC if last night's performance is going to be prolonged. Kwang Hee is a good dude, but all of his variety mannerisms and behaviours comes across as a desperate plea to be popular or stand out. Which is fine considering ZEA is still struggling but on Muho that type of presence just hinders the team chemistry that we as long time fans have all come to love. If he can adapt, than more power to him but if NHC/Gil return, than what?   People have this idea that Gil/NHC are not going to return to one of the biggest if not the biggest variety show in S.Korea is so baffling to me. Why wouldn't they? Put aside the fact that for NHC; that's his life's work, this is NHC primary source of income. What is the kid going to do from now on? He is on hiatus, he is on vacation, he is having a good time. If he plans on spending the rest of his life on vacation, than kudos but I dont think he worked that hard to retire on a drunk driving scandal."
koreanvariety,362z6i,chillingwithavillain,2,Sat May 16 07:43:06 2015 UTC,"Even if you disagree with what this person said, why downvote a well-articulated opinion? This boards mentality of ""downvote everything you disagree with"" should really stop. For the record I think Siwon would make a far worse pick than Kwang Hee, Siwon is the definition of a ""one trick pony"". Siwon was my least favorite candidate who was in the running for the Sixth Man. I haven't watched the latest episode yet, so no comment on how Kwang Hee did."
koreanvariety,362z6i,Hyperion98,-1,Sat May 16 17:10:50 2015 UTC,"Kwang Hee is also a one trick pony, my point was that with Siwon who is less obnoxious, not unnecessary loud, and not dependent on others to help him as much as well as his immense popularity and plans on branching out in Hollywood. It was a win-win situation for IC, considering they can market their show to the international fans (which is a tremendous market considering Running Man is Korea's biggest exploit to date in the context of their media yet has sub-par national ratings) and if/when NHC and Gil return back to Infinity Challenge and Siwon is not fitting well with the original extremely well liked team, Siwon can be removed without it becoming too much of an issue. NHC and Gil will most certainly come back since it is one of the biggest variety shows in S.Korea, and it comes with a whole bunch of perks that most people in variety would kill for.   I find it surprising people would even make the insinuation that NHC is retiring from variety based on one interview. Not everything that you read is true children, media does an excellent job of twisting words and over-exagerating what people say. Muho is also  his entire life its not like he is an actor or a singer, he is a variety MC. It is also one of the biggest shows in S.Korea as well.  Downvotes from imbeciles who lack basic reading comprehension and essentially down vote because they threw a temper tantrum that someone is proving a review of the episode with a perspective that differs from theirs doesn't affect me in the least. Children will behave like children."
koreanvariety,362z6i,Hyperion98,1 point,Sat May 16 15:44:13 2015 UTC,"NHC and Gil will not be coming back. NHC says himself that he has no interest in returning to TV anytime soon, and Gil has been back doing music activities but not television. It's clear that there is no intention for them to return.  Also, the fact that KTH decided to bring in a new cast member essentially means that NHC/Gil will not be returning anytime soon as well. They keep marketing the 10th anniversary as a new beginning. It is clear that they intend to move on without NHC/Gil. All the better really.  Also, Siwon is the DEFINITION of one-trick pony. All he can do is the American-style mess that got old within one episode! He is uninspiring and just completely bland. He would have been my last choice of all the options."
koreanvariety,362z6i,polidarida,1 point,Sat May 16 16:38:56 2015 UTC,"Re: NHC and Gil I think the one interview is enough to go on. If he truly was just laying low and waiting for the right time to return, he wouldn't have made that interview at all! If you look at this article: http://media.daum.net/entertain/star/newsview?newsid=20150205170808361; the average return time for celebrities after DUI is 4.5 months. So by industry standards it is 'fine' for them to return by now. It makes no sense that Gil can return to music but not television! If he can get back into one then naturally he should be allowed to return to the other! He has performed in concerts since so your logic that its fine that he does music but not television doesn't make sense at all! The fact of the matter is, Gil has no intent to return otherwise he would have jumped back in just like he jumped back into music. NHC has said himself that he is enjoying life without tv and he only did it because it was 'fun'; now that that 'fun' is gone he himself said that he had no plans to return.   Please stop dwelling in denial! NHC and Gil are gone are they are happy that way.  Re: KTH and 6th Man Yes, the intention of 6th Man was to bring in another member to even out the numbers for long-term projects. However, if you think about it this way: If NHC/Gil was to return soon, there would be no need to waste time finding another member because they would soon be back to even the numbers! The fact that KTH did not wait for Gil/NHC to even the numbers means that there are no plans in the future to bring them back - or else they would have just waited a bit! YJS himself clearly stated that 6th Man is not a ploy to bring back Gil and NHC because for all intents and purposes they are not going to return.  Re: Siwon Siwon has no variety skill at all... he was the least liked candidate among Korean audiences and was not received well by critics if you read korean news. You say he has 5+ years of variety experience, but doing what? He has never been part of the regular cast of a weekly tv show... all he does is make guest appearances from time to time. We Got Married isn't an appropriate program because there is comedy to it!! Guest appearances are easy - there is no burden of continuously entertaining the audience week-in, week-out. He can pull the same tricks, the same talents every time he appears because he isn't a regular member. A lot of korean viewers complained about his candidacy in 6th Man because his American-style ploy was getting old.  Maybe you are a Super Junior fan and thats why you are getting all upset about this. But face the facts - Siwan has no variety talent (no acting talent nor music talent for that matter); and the members (who voted and worked with all the candidates) agree!!  Did you even watch the 6th Man episodes? His parts with Haha were bland and unentertaining. The only thing he has is endless motivation but in the end whats the point if you can't entertain? Also - he has so many movie and international commitments that he would be a massive BURDEN on MuDo. Why must MuDo sacrifice itself for him?  Re: Kwanghee I think Kwanghee fits very well with the members, and guess what? The majority of Korean viewers agree! http://media.daum.net/entertain/enews/newsview?newsid=20150511103615644. A poll on Daum gave him a 87% approval rating! He is energetic and is able to verbally spar with the members. He has a lot of talk show experience and is a new character to the group. This episode was great and today's was even better!"
koreanvariety,362z6i,deavyt,2,Sat May 16 08:06:40 2015 UTC,"i do not agree on you in this one. ruling out possibility of NHC coming back to the show obviously will make IC viewers mad.the members, viewers and the show itself have strong attachment to him. the time in the interview were made is during the period of the sixthman project. so, i think he does not want to give extra pressure for sixthman nominee"
koreanvariety,362z6i,blackspade94,2,Sat May 16 16:55:14 2015 UTC,"It's slightly worrying that you're completely incapable of accepting the fact that people can have opinions different from your own.  People are free to interpret things however they want, that's how life is. It also would probably be wise for you to refrain from making assumptions about people based on nothing because it makes you seem childish when you have to resort to insulting others.   At the end of the day NHC/Gil may or may not come back (no-one knows for certain except from them) and Kwang Hee is still going to be on IC. There is nothing you, or anyone else, can do about it so it would probably be healthy to let go of all that anger you're holding and keep discussions civilised."

koreanvariety,360jp9,0moe,1 point,Fri May 15 13:38:05 2015 UTC,"To be fair, the episode was disappointing not because of Big Bang but because of the RM production team. They didn't have any entertaining mini games during those episodes. Long chase games are super boring."

We'll see, but hopefully that's the case since we then won't have to wait too long for some interesting filming reports (unless it's closed off completely to spectators)."
koreanvariety,360jp9,amelisa28,2,Fri May 15 08:32:05 2015 UTC,"The hide and seek game during Big Bang's episode was painful to watch because of how heavy handed the scripted scenes were.   ""Oh I caught you... oops you managed to escape.. silly me..""  RM was able to improve since then by removing those god awful scripted chases (or at least make it less obvious). I hope Big Bang's appearance this time will be better. Seungri and Daesung are really funny in variety shows."
koreanvariety,360jp9,themadbat,2,Fri May 15 13:10:36 2015 UTC,Some parts may be scripted. I dont know if you refere to the HAHA-GD scenes but that was just comedy and basically the highlight/drama those episodes had to offer.
koreanvariety,360jp9,0moe,-2,Fri May 15 13:39:30 2015 UTC,"RM chases are 90% scripted. That's perfectly fine as long as the scenes make sense when viewed from the game mechanics perspective.  For example, the goal of chases is to tear off name tags and eliminate players. When a chaser corners a target, the target should not be able to escape because the chaser ""wasn't paying attention"". That's just lazy scripting.  If the target is not supposed to be eliminated just yet, then just run a bit slower and let the target run away. This way, the scripted scene is believable, unlike the earlier scenario.  I don't remember the specifics of the Big Bang episode. I only remember the sour taste it left in my mouth because of some shitty scripted scenes. It's a shame because Big Bang is awesome."
koreanvariety,360jp9,themadbat,3,Fri May 15 14:17:09 2015 UTC,"I dont think the chases were 90% scripted. There are some unwritten rules on the show like female guests or guests in general are not taken out immediately. Also, they dont use all their strength against guests. I wouldnt call it scripted though.   To fit their characters on the show, LKS in the past pretended to be weaker same for Gary and KJKs weakness against girls. Would it make sense if KJK would attack female guests with all his strenght everytime ?   Would you call these things scripted ? For me, scripted means the outcome is predetermined and can not be changed. But the show lives of its improv and unscripted interactions between the cast/guest (in the past during chases)  Btw: I know some parts are in fact 100 % scripted and they suck hard, yes."
koreanvariety,360jp9,0moe,1 point,Fri May 15 15:52:37 2015 UTC,"The outcomes aren't predetermined, but there is a handful of chosen players who can win, and a bigger pool of players that cannot win. But anyway, the outcome isn't what's wrong with scripted chases.   What matters is that sometimes, the scripted chases results in ingame actions that are totally illogical. For example, letting your cornered prey go for no good reason, and a lot of illogical decision making during ""spy"" missions. These kinds of scenes breaks immersion because the player actions do not make any sense game-wise.  I remember the first appreance of the RM guest (forgot the name, used to be on XMAN, jiujitsu guy, 007 episode). He really wanted to properly play the game using an optimized strategy, but everyone else is just fooling around. RM is still a game show. Scripted or not, the games should still be designed to be played. Right now, chase scenes are more like comedy sketches.  RM chases are fundamentally not meant for character interactions. Think about it, the goal of chases is to avoid the other guy. There is a lot more funny moments to be had during mini-games, especially well designed ones. Chases aren't meant for talking.   Edit: Also, you seem to be underestimating the number of unwritten rules. There is a ton of them compared to IC chases. And it causes guests to second guess whether they can do something or not, which makes them look uncomfortable on screen. How many times have you heard guests say ""oh... what am I supposed to do..."" That's a red flag about how confusing RM chases are."
koreanvariety,360jp9,themadbat,2,Fri May 15 17:35:01 2015 UTC,"I disagree about chases not being meant for interaction. Reasons: Most of the time, unless its a deathmatch situation, there are missions for the chased team to complete and win. Also: interaction comes through alliances and betrayal. This happened all the time. You said the key is to avoid each other but confrontation can not be avoided thus ""talking"" is going to happen."
koreanvariety,360jp9,0moe,0,Fri May 15 20:29:11 2015 UTC,"The mission for the chased team is usually to find objects in a very large place. They have to split up to do that. That doesn't seem to encourage interaction at all as compared to games where all the members are in the same place. You CAN interact, but the game isn't designed well for interaction.   As for the whole alliance and betrayal, some of those work and are funny, but most of the time they are illogical and just a way to control the outcome.  For example,  player A does not need to win, so he just casually turns his back on his ""ally"" and gets betrayed. That is an example of shitty scripted scenes I hate because the scene is illogical from a game mechanics perspective. RM members have been playing the chase game for a long time so they know how to win (like protecting your back at all times, don't trust anyone, etc). But since scripts excludes some from winning, those guys ""forget"" about those and gets ""betrayed""."
koreanvariety,360jp9,themadbat,1 point,Sat May 16 02:52:33 2015 UTC,"I think alliances and betrayal works just fine. I could imagine myself being in such a situation where you know the other ""players"" really well and have to play chasing games every weak. There can only be one winner but enemies are too strong to take on alone. Alliances are fragile because they can not last forever yet you need them.   Its true that often its illogical from a game mechanics perspective. It only makes sense when taking their onscreen characters into account + some common sense."

koreanvariety,360wep,autowikibot,1 point,Fri May 15 06:19:40 2015 UTC,"Heroes (South Korean TV series):       Heroes (Hangul: 영웅호걸; hanja: 英雄豪傑) was a South Korean variety show; a part of SBS's Good Sunday lineup, along with Running Man. It is classified as a ""popularity search variety"", where the female celebrities compete to find out which of them is more popular among citizens. It was first aired on July 18, 2010 and ended on May 1, 2011 with a total of 40 episodes aired. Each week, the celebrities are divided into two equal groups of a ""Popular"" group and an ""Unpopular"" group (or ""Not-So-Popular"" group) and must complete certain missions every episode and whoever wins usually get a prize, such as the other team must make dinner for them, they get a hot shower and beds, etc.      Interesting: Soo-ah | Ok Taecyeon | Korean drama   Parent commenter can toggle NSFW or delete.

koreanvariety,360wep,Enter_Text_Here,3,Fri May 15 17:19:43 2015 UTC,"Showtime series are nice too. They feature a certain group for 10 epd. Girl group wise, I only know Apink and sistar had been featured.  It also depends on what shows you like. Hello baby is another dated one that features a certain group for 20ish epd.   And if you like Apink, there's 3 seasons of Apink news."

As far as I know, he still has to do his military service (someone feel free to correct me), but he's solid as a host and entertainer.    I could see Cha Tae Hyun having success, but really depends on the route his career goes. He's still acting, so that might take time away from him being a MC.    After those two, I have no clue. I don't really watch many other variety shows. Just RM, 1N2D, and Return of Superman."
koreanvariety,360x9u,d0uble0h,5,Fri May 15 05:31:47 2015 UTC,LSG is good MC but I find him too nice that it feels a bit bland
koreanvariety,360x9u,polidarida,8,Fri May 15 14:01:27 2015 UTC,It seems Yoo Jae Suk has been mentoring HaHa for years now but it seems whenever he has the opportunity to MC he's lacking. Maybe when Yoo Jae Suk steps down (please never) HaHa will step up.
koreanvariety,360x9u,Jynxette,7,Fri May 15 07:44:33 2015 UTC,"Yoo Jae Suk also has been mentoring Lee Kwang Soo, whom he dotes the most in Running Man. And lately, LKS has been given more and more chances to lead or at least be the second-in-command."
koreanvariety,360x9u,arumdayo,3,Fri May 15 09:05:14 2015 UTC,Everybody loves Kwangsoo for his silly character. Succeeding YJS and becoming a main MC would mean he would need to change his character to be more serious. Idk if that would be good for him.
koreanvariety,360x9u,PapaBearBrian,2,Mon May 18 22:07:16 2015 UTC,I do really like LKS. We always hear from him about how YJS says he's the best and I agree.
koreanvariety,360x9u,Jynxette,0,Fri May 15 12:15:46 2015 UTC,Don't know if he can lose his betrayer tag and be taken seriously as an MC.
koreanvariety,360x9u,Enter_Text_Here,3,Fri May 15 17:07:35 2015 UTC,His betrayal acts have been fewer and far between currently. And he has started to getting more recognition as an actor.
koreanvariety,360x9u,arumdayo,8,Sat May 16 04:51:57 2015 UTC,"The problem is that the current crop of MC's (YJS, SDY, KHD) are just too good. You could probably throw in the lesser known but equally respected MC's Kim Gura and Lee Kyungkyu as well. They are all relatively old (40-50's) but hold quite a monopoly over the industry.... there have been very little up and comers in recent years and part of the problem is that they don't have opportunities to do so.  A decade and a half ago when YJS rose to the limelight he did so after he was given the main MC for a show even when he was essentially unknown... those opportunities just don't exist anymore because the current crop of MC's are too good. All of the main MC's we see on tv nowadays are all from the 90's...  Now of course there are some bubbling names such as Jung Hyungdon, Kim Shinyoung, Heo Kyunghwan and arguably the 1N2D guys (KJM, CTH, Defconn). But they aren't young either... mid to late 30's!! By his late 30's YJS was already lead MC on 3 primetime shows.... a testament to how the industry is moving backwards as younger MC's have so many barriers to the top of the industry. None of the names I mentioned above have even 1 primetime show that the lead as an MC... and thats the problem right there.  As of now, there just doesn't seem to be an apparent successor... sure YJS has nurtured the likes of NHC, JHD, Haha, LKS among many others... but none of them apart from JHD look like they have a future in MC-ing... Haha was quite disappointing in Invisible Man and LKS is better as comedic foil than straight up MC... if you check out KHD and SDY's shows... many of them are one-man shows. There simply isn't room for younger MC's...."

koreanvariety,360x9u,kelmah,3,Fri May 15 07:43:27 2015 UTC,I am a Man was set to be 20 episode long. Only to be renewed if it did well on the ratings. It became a running joke later on when they beg for viewers that they would become unemployed.  Jang DongMin is good but he is unable to thinking/explaining clearly which got him on trouble twice already.
koreanvariety,360x9u,sirrenitee,2,Fri May 15 08:57:05 2015 UTC,"my list of good MC: kim junho (but he is already old-40+ years old)  jun hyun moo  no hong chul (he is really good and hv achieved success on main channel network..... hope he will return back from hiatus sooner)  haha  jung hyung don (he MCed a lot of shows)  kwanghee (he is really talkative and hilarious. can keep the flow of shows. not awkward with people)  leeteuk  jang dong min  i intentationally didn't include some people like cha tae hyun, lee seung gi, lee kwang soo since i do not see them taking the path as a permanent variety MC for at least next 5years)  p/s: it is very hard to find the successor of YJS, KHD, SDY since the structure have changed."
koreanvariety,360x9u,polidarida,3,Fri May 15 16:36:45 2015 UTC,"Yeah you make a good point about the structure changing. Nowadays, ensemble casts are much more common than MC-led shows. 1N2D's is probably the best example: none of the guys particularly stand out as a MC; they all carry out the role in different ways."

Sometimes I'll watch if a celebrity I like is a guest, but the celebrities really don't get a lot of screen time other than the very beginning. If I do watch an episode now, I'll skip through to see if there are any good parts.   Also, the responses to some of the more serious concerns really highlighted some of the problems in Korean culture as a whole, and it was too disturbing to watch. I was really disturbed by the lady who was a very serious alcoholic, and they didn't think it was much of a concern. There was also the dude who wouldn't quit smoking, and they didn't think that was much of a problem either. The most disturbing was the one where the father was sexually molesting his son, and they didn't think that was much of a problem either!"
koreanvariety,35xjx3,apreche,2,Thu May 14 13:30:55 2015 UTC,"i watched a recent one where a wife was concerned that her husband said work was more important than her....okay yes he is working to support his father and her family, give him a break. But then you learn he called the police on her at work for trespassing and told them he didn't know who she was ""to teach her a lesson"" and wouldn't come to the hospital to consent to surgery when she was having a miscarriage and sent his father instead. He owns a car audio business it isn't like people are going to die if he leaves work!"
koreanvariety,35xjx3,Snickerdoodled,1 point,Thu May 14 14:11:12 2015 UTC,"How many votes were there? If there are a lot of votes, it doesn't bother me so much since it's like this bad person is getting called out. If they don't get a lot of votes, that's what disturbs me because it suggests such horrible behavior is acceptable in their society.  In the US I can't imagine that concern getting less than 140. I'd say 150, but you always have to account for horrible people in the audience."

koreanvariety,35xjx3,reddituser5k,1 point,Fri May 15 04:13:26 2015 UTC,Exactly why I can't watch it either. The more serious concerns 9/10 times aren't taken seriously and if they are (by getting enough votes) it still doesn't really change anything. The whole concept behind the show is questionable and the seriousness of a lot of the concerns can get really disturbing. Glossing over serious issues with 'comedy' will always get on my nerves. (this is one of my least favorite things about variety shows in general along with the hidden camera pranks that get taken way too far too often.)

It's just I get in the bath, I watch a bit of it, then some days later I have some free time and I watch next bit, etc, and then there's the next episode.  Gosh, guys. Yeah, I know, Korean culture is a bit weird for us, Westerners, but I think it's better that there's a show highlighting some issues. Even if MCs respond in a way we do not consider proper, we do need to remember it's a TV show that needs to help and be nice at once.  Yes, most of these guys should go to the mental health doctor, but in Korea it's considered to be a service for real-real crazy people. I think shows like that are doing a big favor for them! They can break the tabu slowly, with no revolution. It's not USA, where everybody is open and vulgar all the time. It's Korea who is getting used to the world's culture. Please understand it, guys."

My thoughts are inline with the other posts regarding the occasional serious disorder that gets completely ignored as being a serious mental condition. The OCD, Alcoholic, and borderline psychopathic guests I feel the worst for. I would think that having 150 people say they're ""fine"" only prolongs the dynamic without professional intervention.

Also, spoilers****  I wonder if Jang Dong Min messed up his script because I don't understand why he was lying in his alibi when he was not the criminal. Also, I never liked EXO, nor did I ever find any of their members attractive and never got the fuss around Xiu Min because he looks like a kid, but I seriously just became a fan of that guy. That was some really smooth lying and good acting, never looked taken back. I am also a bit disappointed they did not look or find the candles suspicious."
koreanvariety,35vsuu,dattroll123,2,Mon May 18 05:46:01 2015 UTC,"Jang Mate did not lie about his alibi. He was at the bridge at 8-8.30 so the gun never left his sight. However, the gun was already short of a bullet by then, as Xi Manager took the bullet from it before 8 to load his own gun and kill the victim during the fireworks. No one had an alibi that accounted for the gun or at the bridge before 8."

Now that i think about it she hasn't been on Gag Concert for a very long time, like a year or so. It's a shame but she was one one of favourite comedians (not just female comedians but comedians) on the show."
koreanvariety,35rk33,deoxix,4,Tue May 12 23:42:41 2015 UTC,http://www.allkpop.com/article/2015/04/shin-bora-discusses-why-she-left-gag-concert-and-her-singing-career  pretty much what everyone said
koreanvariety,35rk33,godlymelonx,5,Tue May 12 23:44:44 2015 UTC,I believe she had ventured into developing her singing career. She recently appeared on music shows and notably on Mask King (she's the one of the left. EXID's Solji is on the right).
koreanvariety,35rk33,femacca,3,Wed May 13 05:06:33 2015 UTC,"She's really quite talented and seems to want to try doing other things, she might go back to gag concert if those don't work out I guess"

koreanvariety,35q42d,qazwaxedc,34,Tue May 12 16:17:13 2015 UTC,"He's a great example of a great entertainer. Here's an example :      He used to be a smoker, but he realize, while the ""pathetic"" character work for some time. In the long run, viewer need more than that. He need to provide an exciting/competitive tag game. This fact were not a wild fans speculation, he actually said this in his interview. Now, how many times you heard A-list entertainer do this for the sake of TV show ?  Never, exactly. He have phobia of heights. It's hard to explain to someone who hasn't phobia, how phobia can be crippling.  But whenever he's in that situation, he doesn't break and move on, just for the sake of giving laugh, keeping his promise. He's up to date with current trend. Did you ever wonder, given his busy schedule, he always keep the chat with his guest always relevant ? While  he's sometimes didn't recognize the unknown rookie artist name, he almost always knew the show/movie they were in, what role/scene, etc. This was not a result of YJS reading a cue card from writer. In his home, YJS view three TV simultaneously ! Yep you heard that right. His schedule was so busy, so he do that in order to keeping himself updated. If you see other host, most of them rely on cue card, and can't get passed the topic beyond what the writer tell them.  This wasn't the case for YJS. He's humble. And his humbleness is a real deal.  He's among the highest paid entertainer in Korean, and one of the most recognizable face in South Korea.  In one of RM episodes, he use a hat that practically cover 90 % of his face, only give a citizen a silhouette look under that semi black transparent hat. Yet, the public still recognize that face ! That show you how his face is almost embedded in people subconsciously, almost like a seeing family member face.   But, he didn't act like many A-list entertainer. He didn't keep distance with his fans, he didn't care about image (well he do, but we will get to that later). He views himself as a regular Joe, just a dude with a job, and nothing else. He didn't use media play to boost his image. All of his good deeds were known because someone else reporting it (eg; huge Church donation, and it wasn't one time deal, etc). Remember when i told you that he actually care about his image ? Well he do, but in a very good way. His house and car actually very modest,  compare to entertainer who has the same wealth and fame as him (even below!). He's very-very hesitant to move to better house and get a more luxurious car, because he's afraid his fans might think he's changing.  No, it wasn't a fans speculation, he actually said this in his interview.   Those character traits is the reason he can stole the heart of Korea, for years and years. You do realize that in South Korea, the higher you go the more 'saint-like-behavior' you have to behave, right ?    One mistakes/scandal and it's pretty much over no matter how famous you are.      But i think his greatest talent that he can evolve, according to current trend, it's subtle, almost unnoticeable unless you follow his career in a long run. In South Korea, pretty much every single celebrity has one 'image', and they sell based on that. When public get bored with the image, it's pretty much the end of your entertainment career. YJS is not YJS you see in present days. He used to be a simple gagman, a slapstick comedian, an actor (yes..actor!), until he focusing to become MC. He's really evolving over the years, while still maintaining his original image (slapstick).   The last one is the important bit.  He somehow manage to retain a different kind of image in different show. This is rare. Like i said, and you can see yourself, almost all entertainer has only one set of image and that was it. On different show, all the entertainer still use that same kind of image. This wasn't the case in YJS.   Example : In RM, you can pretty much bullying him as much as you want. This is his main role.   But in IC, he become a classy leader, not exaggerating reaction etc. He keep the flow of the banter.  This is very subtle, because due editing, it's almost rare to see YJS gives a cue to his fellow member. But it's there in every single episodes,...   In HT3, he become a talkshow host, this is the most prominent where he can be seen giving the cue to member/guest. Still subtle due editing, but more prominent than in IC. You have to focusing in his eyes, where he look while he's listening to story. I'm not making this up, this exact trait is being discussed in various ep of IC and HT3 by guest / member.     Edit: Adding example : In FO, he pretty much use a dumb and dumber character (along with Daesung). In KungKungTa, he delivered his jokes through words, rare to see these days. In X-Man, ah, there's sooo many thing why in X-Man he's soo good (Banter, playword, building up comedy for other to pickup)   The point is, in every show, he changed the way he's appear. And public still accept this ""new"" image. For quick comparison, just see RM early days and present day. And you will see he's really different, yet you barely noticed it."
koreanvariety,35q42d,YJSubs,3,Tue May 12 22:11:07 2015 UTC,"yeah i think the biggest thing that got to me about YJS was from this clip where you see how humble he is because he knew where he was and how fortunate to be where he is.  He knows he's successful now but he also knows at time when no one knew who he was.  He's also aware, as you said, at how quickly people can fade into obscurity when they're no longer relevant, and he has said he knows there's a time coming when he'll one day fade and lives prepared to pass on the baton.  He also thanks people around him and doesn't really take all the credit for himself.  It's just things like this that, that are part of who he is, so it makes it genuine and not feel forced"
koreanvariety,35q42d,aznanimedude,7,Tue May 12 23:46:31 2015 UTC,"Best thing about that clip is, he actually made this 'self-camera' for a show called Beautiful Face which was more than 10 years before that IC fans meeting. This was when the first time he got recognition as a comedian. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6L39zi8zX8  So he wasn't made that statement up on the spot (on IC fans meeting). He really did make the promise and he kept it ever since."
koreanvariety,35q42d,ginastringr,1 point,Wed May 13 01:56:09 2015 UTC,How come you being downvoted ? What you said is true.
koreanvariety,35q42d,YJSubs,1 point,Wed May 13 03:32:56 2015 UTC,Man... the video you linked was beautiful. Yoo Jae Suk is a person I truly look up to now.
koreanvariety,35q42d,airogent,3,Wed May 13 14:58:16 2015 UTC,"I honestly doubt he can fall to obscurity (unless he's getting involved in MAJOR scandal). IMO, he's gonna be like David Letterman, he will have a very long career, and he will resign just because he wanted to resign."
koreanvariety,35q42d,YJSubs,1 point,Wed May 13 00:20:34 2015 UTC,"I agree. And he recognizes that he can't go on forever, that eventually his sun will set (curse that day...) and it will be time for someone else to take his place and continue leading people on the path of excellence. He talked about this with Haha on the IC special and Haha was like what no you can't leave us but YJS made it clear one day Haha would have to carry on without him and he wants Haha to be ready for that day."
koreanvariety,35q42d,SpCommander,2,Fri May 15 23:50:28 2015 UTC,"A consummate and versatile MC and gagman, and the perfect personality destined to be on TV. Being exceedingly demanding on himself to keep up with times and thus becoming the exemplary model for all TV personalities. Staying humble and down-to-earth despite his immense success. Korean TV is blessed to have him."

koreanvariety,35q42d,YJSubs,1 point,Wed May 13 06:33:31 2015 UTC,Little late to the party but one more reason to love YJS.  Before RM he was King
koreanvariety,35q42d,lagniapper,13,Tue May 19 00:44:42 2015 UTC,I think it's because he's genuine and he makes the best out of tough/awkward situations. Also he's really good at keeping the flow/conversation/humor of the show going.
koreanvariety,35q42d,Fist2nuts,5,Tue May 12 16:53:09 2015 UTC,I agree. It's also because he knows how to bring out the best in his guests. he isn't just funny himself he knows how to make other people funny too.
koreanvariety,35q42d,LiteratiTempo,8,Tue May 12 19:58:54 2015 UTC,"A lot of people in the variety scene rely on a certain persona or shtick to be funny, which can become boring to audiences after a while and it's difficult to reinvent oneself when this happens. I think the reason as to why Jaesuk has been able to stay relevant is because he can be funny without having to create a character for himself."
koreanvariety,35q42d,tt-asha,2,Tue May 12 19:27:56 2015 UTC,"First of all, Yoo Jae Suk has the sense of leadership and he can take the leader at any time, under any situation.  He respect the viewers and also the most important thing, He is not the type of selling his face to promote other company unless if the show has a contract.  Finally, He know the value of money and he gave what he got."
koreanvariety,35q42d,KSyndic,2,Tue May 12 20:31:19 2015 UTC,"Respects all those around him (fans, elders, youngsters, etc) Takes care of himself and what others thinks about him Continuously pushing the envelop on shows Connects himself with good people and makes good people connected with him Stays the same but at the same time betters himself in time (like fine wine) Is funny"
koreanvariety,35q42d,Hitokiri2,2,Wed May 13 01:34:48 2015 UTC,He's witty and has the gift of gab.
koreanvariety,35q42d,Enter_Text_Here,1 point,Wed May 13 01:59:24 2015 UTC,"Its all simply because he was unknown before and he worked like a blardy dog to be where he is today.  When one has been poor/jobless/unknown and looked down before and when he becomes successful. He wont not forget those time.   Have you guys ever seen in his shows, whenever he meets the 'ordinary people'. He would greet them first before other casts. He would greet the older folks and try to behave like their son.  In the latest few eps of IC when they had to 'swim' to the boat using the floating thingy. Other casts like PMS quickly gave up but he kept on trying.  He is my favourite entertainer and i respect him alot. There is no one in the whole world who is similar to him."
koreanvariety,35q42d,enrell,1 point,Wed May 13 14:04:32 2015 UTC,"When I first started watching k-variety through Running Man, I didn't like Yoo Jae Seok at all and thought he was butt ugly but the deeper I got into K-variety, the more I found out how humble and how well respected he is, so now, I've become a big fan of his.    Now, he looks handsome to me, no matter how ugly he looks on TV :)  When RM filmed in my country, my only wish was to see YJS live. Unfortunately, it didn't happen, instead all I saw were JSJ and SJH (who was really tiny and pretty).  Oh well, maybe next time, I'll catch YJS>  I'll be very sad if something bad happens to him."

koreanvariety,35lsuo,hubwub,22,Mon May 11 15:38:24 2015 UTC,This episode was really terrific. Jae Suk stealing Kwang Soo's car was amazing. It could easily make a list of all time best moments in RM.

koreanvariety,35lsuo,BrandCAG,2,Tue May 12 04:39:44 2015 UTC,"rofl ""here's how you win, and here's how you become out"", so of course what's the first thing he does?"
koreanvariety,35lsuo,aznanimedude,7,Tue May 12 23:49:29 2015 UTC,"Another Kwang Soo moment I really liked is when Ji Hyo said her leg was cramping and in the next scene she's on the floor and he's massaging her foot lmao. It's kinda cute how they look after her through subtle actions, like Suk Jin tying her shoes."
koreanvariety,35lsuo,khandiments,2,Wed May 13 09:06:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Suk Jin looked really sincere when Jae Suk said he had a cramp. But I think Kwang Soo is so genuinely nice."
koreanvariety,35lsuo,okayAlright_,15,Wed May 13 10:44:56 2015 UTC,"I really like this EP concept of having someone that doesnt know the game rules.  Really excited for  the next ep,  Kwang soo in charge is bound to bring so much laughter. Also them raiding his house similar to what they did to HaHa(Im sure its a completely different mission but still)."
koreanvariety,35lsuo,llionell,3,Tue May 12 00:44:56 2015 UTC,"I liked it, it's like reverse spy, rather than the Spy/Spies knowing something everyone else doesn't, the spies don't know anything and have to figure everything out"

koreanvariety,35lsuo,natcookie,12,Tue May 12 01:47:36 2015 UTC,"This is a good episode. Not a full-of-laugh but really makes you want to follow it until the end. The theme feels similar to old episodes but a completely fresh concept.  By the way the reveal was a huge plot twist. All my guesses was completely wrong. Awesome editing and execution by the staff and members. The actress should've been on the show from the start though, she's funny from her last 2 appearance on RM and on Happy Together.  And next week episode looks like there's no guest and a new concept again. Seems like a super interesting with lots of interaction between members. Can't wait for it."
koreanvariety,35lsuo,ginastringr,1 point,Tue May 12 01:48:06 2015 UTC,I thought it was the guests and discarded Yoo Jae Suk because Ji Hyo said her leg cramped to him and he didn't react!
koreanvariety,35lsuo,khandiments,5,Wed May 13 09:05:14 2015 UTC,This episode was AWEEEEEESOMEEEEE! Everyone looked like they were really enjoying the game. Ji Hyo being so confused was so funny and cute. I really thought it was Gary for a while since he seemed a little clueless in the first game. Such a great episode

koreanvariety,35lsuo,tt-asha,3,Tue May 12 04:05:12 2015 UTC,"Ah, I love it when there's suspense involved in the episodes and as a viewer you're trying to figure out what's happening while you're watching."

koreanvariety,35lsuo,RaginReap,2,Tue May 12 14:15:13 2015 UTC,This episode was pretty good. HaHa's fail moment was one of the highlights as well as Jae Suk stealing Kwang Soo's car.  Next week's episodes looking like it'll be good as well. Can't wait! (I haven't felt this way with RM episodes for a while now so this is pretty good)
koreanvariety,35lsuo,LeT0ucan,2,Tue May 12 17:25:17 2015 UTC,"I have a question. Why did jae suk not respond to ji hyo's code of ""I have a cramp"" the first time? Did he just not hear her?"
koreanvariety,35lsuo,dattroll123,7,Tue May 12 19:36:39 2015 UTC,"I think he did hear her, but since they weren't alone, he couldn't reveal his identity at that time.  That was a good episode. I LOL'd so hard at HaHa"

I'd previously assumed the same things as the other users below, but then I saw that comment.  Though about the sesame oil thing, didn't JH end up being the one saying it because JS had initiated the contact by saying the cramp part? I had assumed it didn't matter who initiated it, just that it was said in the correct sequence. At least that was my interpretation based on the subs since I personally can only rely on them (and other users' comments)."

I was thinking about how easily the whole thing could've unraveled if the members who knew the rules just proved it by simply talking about the instructions they were given. But obviously they all knew how to drag it out and be weary of each other in order to keep the fake detectives confused.  Whether it was random or deliberate, I love that Jihyo was one of the chosen for the job. Her Mongji character always throws suspicion off of her hahah! And really good editing; I was really trying hard to figure out who the other fake detective was and it wasn't until the telephone round that it was finally revealed.  Can't wait for next week!

It's like a mix of reality tv with sit com and it doesn't take itself very seriously.

koreanvariety,35k0m9,TaeTaeyeon,6,Mon May 11 21:49:17 2015 UTC,"I watch both, but you know what's really missing in American TV? The feeling that when you're tuning in, you're watching a cast of familiar friends and family.  Like there are shows like the Kardashians which kind of do that, but only in a way that is just blatantly superficial. We complain about scripting in this sub but that's a whole other level of scripting. It's largely unrelatable shock material. And the stuff that is realistic and warm and family oriented suffers from having no-names lead the show, it doesn't have the A-List talent like Jae Suk running the show.  Korean Variety is just on another level there. The talent is A-Level. Jae Suk and Jong Kook bust there ass for filming once a week..I could not imagine any equivalents taking that challenge on in North America. The filming is crazy and runs the whole day. The whole time, they are mindful to be courteous and to create the best product for the viewer. The camera set-ups are masterful and capture every real moment as it happens. And most of all, these are people and situations you can relate to.  Classic Korean Variety syndrome is when the last few episodes have had a gimmick grown stale, but I find myself watching anyways just because I like it when that dude starts bickering with that other dude and it's hilarious. I mean what I end up being invested in is the people, which I guess is the big difference with North America, in North America I would be invested in the show's gimmick."
koreanvariety,35k0m9,jaytheillest,4,Mon May 11 18:21:45 2015 UTC,"The only American tv I watch anymore is cartoons. There are a few newer shows that I've wanted to checkout, like Better Call Saul, but I'm too busy watching Korean shows that I never have the extra time."
koreanvariety,35k0m9,Supplycrate,3,Mon May 11 06:50:01 2015 UTC,"I still watch documentaries and such fairly often on British TV, the BBC and Channel 4 put out a lot of good scientific and historical programming that I enjoy. Also a very occasional British drama (The Game which just started has been pretty good, about cold war spies), but other than that not much.   British TV has fallen pretty far in recent years, particularly with respect to comedy which used to be our specialty. Sketch comedy is dead, there hasn't been a good sitcom in years, and our talk shows are so painfully unfunny. I guess it's because all broadcasters realised it's way cheaper to clog the schedule with yet another derivative panel show, which can sometimes be good but there's so many and the same comedians are always rotating around them doing their same tired acts that I lost interest long ago.   Comedy/variety on Korean TV just seems a lot more inventive and less staid than what we get domestically."
koreanvariety,35k0m9,eNxy,2,Mon May 11 13:54:06 2015 UTC,"I agree - it's pretty dead now, and the only things I really enjoy watching are the documentaries on where your food has come from or how science has saved your pet.  I think as a whole, Chinese/Japanese/Korean TV trumps the rest of the world in the variety category, just more outside the box ideas and sligtly better execution. On the other hand, the rest of the world doesn't do too bad in the movies and series' department.  Either that or I'm just some horrible amalgamation as I'm British born Chinese and I tend to like weird stuff."

It's not that I think Korean stuff is superior or anything, it's just that the things that all my friends are into - big hit stuff like Walking Dead, Breaking Bad, Game of Thrones, etc - really just aren't my style.   I don't hesitate to tell people I don't really watch American television. If something comes along that I want to watch, I totally will. It just hasn't happened in a couple years. There's nothing really like Korean varieties on American television, and I really enjoy the one season arcs of most dramas.   I do actively campaign long and loud to drag my friends into it with me. So far, I haven't gotten anyone to take me up on variety shows, but several of my friends now watch dramas back to back like I do. There's so much stuff!

The one thing I wish America had more of was variety shows, but Lip Sync Battle has been really good so far, so maybe they'll make a resurgence.

The catch the thief game would be easy to create. All the cards have the same face except for one, which is the thief. You just need as many postcards as players, the card faces the person and the person on the right chooses a card from the person on the left in order, then when the first person picks the game is over and everyone shows their cards. The person with the thief loses. This can keep going with more cards added.  I liked the drawing one the best, where they get a word or phrase, they have to depict it to the person in front of them one at a time, the last person guesses what it is. Kind of like the telephone game.  You could do a Speed Quiz and try to make it relevant to the classroom and put random nonsensical things, it would be fun. Especially if it pertains to them, with shit they're interested in.  I think one that would probably be the most fun would be the telepathy game. Where two people listen to music too loud that they can't hear and one has questions and the other has answers. They read them out loud to one another, but they have to match them. It can be a really funny game depending on the responses to the questions, you could divide everyone by teams of two's and whoever gets the most points wins or something."

One 100% fool proof of being funny are the ones in which there's elephant spins involved. One that comes to my mind is the one in which there's two water guns in the center and two persons in both sides. Both have to do 10 elephant spins and then go to grab the water gun to be the first to wet the other one to eliminate him.   More. How about trying to make a tug of war for three teams. It's like the normal one but you tie three ropes and instead of putting some limit put at the end of the three groups some kind of bell or something clear to touch for the winner.  Take chairs with wheels (like an office chair), make a circle in the center of a field and make two teams to play curling. In RM part of the fun was that first there were trash bins and they were inside but i don't think that's that secure for the kids.   There's a classic reduced version of this that is played on a large table with bottle caps. They take turns to throw the bottle caps in the larger side of the table to get as close as possible to the end without falling over. If they play by teams is fairer because otherwise the last ones to throw have an advantage and they can plan simple strategies like sacrificing caps to throw off the table other bottle caps which can be funny and engaging to them.   Get all of them in a open place (with gym mats on the ground) and play a couple of rounds of the chicken leg fight. That is, if you didn't know, the one in which you are on just one foot with the other one over the other leg knee and have to knock over the other players until there's one winner.   And there a lot more. Look in children games books, like the one they in youth associations (like the boy scouts in america). You will see dozens of games like these, a lot of them that you probably didn't and are pretty funny to play even as an adult."

koreanvariety,35h4fm,smooth_randy,4,Sun May 17 20:54:06 2015 UTC,"Bangtan Subs has subbed the first episode but only Rapmon's parts. I think they dropped it because of they were way too busy and the episodes can tend to be quite long.  There are also a few subbers on YouTube who sub small corners or parts of Problematic Men, mainly Rapmon's parts.  It's a pretty fun show, so I do hope there is a subber somewhere who can do it, but other than that I'll try to keep updated.  Linking on my phone is terrible as well so I'm refraining from doing so."

koreanvariety,35g0vl,mkatter,3,Sun May 10 00:13:39 2015 UTC,"General Comments   Kwanghee's first episode as a member of MBC's Infinite Challenge brought in a rating of 11.3%, no difference from last week.    KBS's Immortal Song and SBS's Star King dropped by 1.4% and 0.1% respectively, meaning a larger proportion of the available viewing audience watched Infinite Challenge.  SBS's Some Guy, Some Girl (썸남썸녀) dropped sharply from 4.3% to 3.5% in its second episode. In general, the late-night Tuesday shows are all struggling to meet the 4.0% benchmark.  KBS's Happy Sunday slips in the ratings for another week but still manages to hold onto the #1 spot for 35 weeks in a row. Could Superman/1N2D possibly fall to the surging Mask King/Real Men? MBC's Mask King is generating a lot of buzz due to ""Golden Lacquer"" and due to various idols breaking the stereotype of being ""bad"" singers. Also, Real Men's enlistment into a special forces unit (ROK Navy, Ship Salvage Unit) generated more viewers, allowing it to distance itself from Running Man. SBS's Good Sunday has found stability in the mid-to-high 6% range. It has increased by 0.2% for two weeks in a row.    KBS Pilot Programs   KBS has been churning out pilot programs as of late, responding to the multitude of changes by SBS and MBC. (Spring and Autumn are the seasons where pilot programs come out in a flurry)   Non-variety show Statute of Limitations aired a two episode pilot with okay ratings around ~3.0%. It's fine for a non-variety show IMO. Exciting India / Dugeun Dugeun India ended last week with deplorable ratings (~2.4%). Lady Action aired its two pilot episodes this week, getting 4.9% and 4.8%. It's a strong candidate to become a full program. In comparison, SBS's Same Bed, Different Dreams got a 5.1% rating in its one episode pilot. Look At Me ended its four episode pilot (4.4, 5.2, 4.1, 4.5%).    Finale   tvN's Grandpas Over Flowers in Greece ends after a terrific seven episode run.   Will be replaced by another season of Three Meals a Day (삼시세끼), starring Lee Seo Jin, 2PM's Taecyeon, and Kim Gwang Gyu. First episode next week on May 15.    Upcoming   tvN's Three Meals a Day (삼시세끼) on May 15, replacing Grandpas Over Flowers.   Teaser (with English subs)  KBS drama called The Producers (프로듀사) will start airing on May 15. It airs Friday/Saturday at 9:15 PM, replacing Lady Action. Another new KBS drama called Orange Marmalade (오렌지 마말레이드) will start airing on May 15. It airs right after Producer ends on 10:35 PM, replacing Look At Me. Orange Marmalade will air its first two episodes back-to-back. KBS's In Depth 60 Minutes (추적 60분) will move to Wednesday 11:00 PM, finally filling the vacant spot left by Invisible Man when it ended on April 1.    In Depth 60 Minutes is a highly respected investigative journalism show on air since 1983.  KBS's Human Condition 3 begins on May 23.   If you know about other notable news, please comment. Also, if you see mistakes, let me know right away. Check back tomorrow ~8 PM EST for Sunday ratings. (Ratings fully updated)  edit: Added Three Meals a Day teaser. edit2: Added comments about the Sunday shows."
koreanvariety,35g0vl,deoxix,1 point,Sun May 10 00:29:25 2015 UTC,"I have been always curious to why the ""slot readjustment"" seasons (where they take out program with bad ratings, change others to other slots and make a lot of pilot shows) are in spring and fall. I don't make these kind of decisions but i think maybe summer and winter, when people are either not watching television at all in a vacation or binge watching shows so there's a lot less competition, is way better to air new pilot shows. In spring and fall you're going to be cut to piece by the other channels if you don't have a good show in the first 2 episodes."

Even the boygirl and girlgroup concept is not unique to S.Korean media so I dont understand how you can say its ""original"". Initially It was just fun to see celebrities act in this manner, and than you stick around because Korean MCs are pretty awesome.   This is how I transitioned, I was a hardcore Shawol for about 1.5 years (I am a proud male fan), eventually discovered family outing and now i exclusively just watch KJK and YJS variety shows.

koreanvariety,35c7pw,franciswei,7,Fri May 8 23:57:24 2015 UTC,"I was actually introduced to korean entertainment through watching kdramas.   I ended up accidentally watching kdramas on Netflix, which I was introduced to after finishing GREEK.   After watching a few kdramas, it introduced me to kpop idols (Dream High) since a lot of kpop idols act as well.   I would search for actors or idols I really liked, it would show me cuts from korean variety shows. I ended up trying to look for which the variety shows were because they seemed really funny.   I didn't understand them at all because I didn't know anyone. I still remember my first impression of all the members of Running Man, Infinity Challenge, Happy Together, etc.   But I began by watching english based ones at first, like Gurupop (it was a lot like After School Club, except better) and then I found out about Running Man, it just went off from there.   I even watched idol shows and a lot of what KBS subbed, even some music programs even though I don't really like kpop.  Now I mostly watch Korean variety shows and entertainment, because well, it's just really good. It's really funny, it's the combination of the hosts, staff, and members that does it for me. Sometimes guests too; at first guests were what was important to me, but I soon got over that as I came to love each member or cast member.  The shows keep me entertained, I wish I had friends in real life who liked them and watched them so I would have someone to talk to about them but atlas, I can't seem to get anyone into it except my family.  But I know it's not all shits and giggles, there's some flop variety shows and the cast members work endlessly along with the staff. I respect their diligence and I wish for them to just keep it up.   And I didn't cut out American entertainment out of my life, but I mostly do watch Korean entertainment. I sometimes watch other Asian shows, movies, or dramas involving BollyWood/Taiwanese/Japanese/Thai/etc dramas/movies."

Everything else I watch just don't give me the same feel-good feeling that Korean Variety Show gives me. There's never a dull moment and there's just a lot to watch. I watch pretty much every K-variety show there is, subbed ones of course.  I also want to learn Korean so I could watch even more cause sometimes, it's just not enough. I'm a huge fan of it.  It all started with Golden Star Bell and back then, I stumbled upon the unsubbed version of it on TV. Even if I don't understand what they were saying, I still laughed a ton cause of their expression. Then, I started to find out that there are actually subbed version of these show and that's when I start Running Man. Watched all the episodes and branched out to other Variety show such as IC, IY and many many others.  Korean Variety has been a huge boost for me.

Jinho really did look like Conan hahaa.  On an unrelated note, watching this show has turned me into a clue finding monster. I went to an ""Escape the Room"" game recently and found clues that the rest of my group missed. I'm very proud of myself."

I'm aware of the way around it, but based on the number of views/comments for the latest episode, it seems like a lot of regular viewers are not.   Before the recent situation with KShowOnline, I also had noticed that it's become more difficult to find both new RM episodes and ""Same Bed, Different Dreams"" in HD (at least under fairly obvious file names) on Dailymotion since they end up being removed by SBS soon after. I've become slightly worried because of that development since there was at least a bit of a break in between before."

koreanvariety,34ry4u,ginastringr,0,Fri May 8 17:34:41 2015 UTC,"As much as I hate it, Running Man has gone past its peak... If PDs are not doing anything new, we're only going downhill from here.   I'm sure that not only the Korean but international fans are leaving RM now, we just can't see it because there's no rating system and no competition (we can watch 1N2D and RealMan in different time, unlike most Korean).   Of course I still enjoy RM (including this episode), but if I really think about it... not as much as years ago."

I personally think running man is still enjoyable, not as much as before though. I'm more interested in seeing the interaction between than them actually playing the game. I'm not saying the games they play are not watchable or anything, it's just somewhat a little repetitive, in a good way (I think). I don't know, I have mix feeling/view on this."
koreanvariety,34ry4u,furyswipesoflove,0,Tue May 5 15:17:04 2015 UTC,"Basically discussions here are about expressing how every RM episode is the most fun episode you evar saw in one or two sentences. Everything else will get downvoted to oblivion and there's no point of using explanations since they don't care to understand it anyways.  Surely, they are bad episodes as there are good episodes, but many people just don't like to admit it.  EDIT: Look at all these butthurt downvotes, lol!"
koreanvariety,34ry4u,0moe,2,Tue May 5 22:13:34 2015 UTC,"Mate, you are not alone. This is not a place for discussion. All I ever read is how great the new episode is. Maybe people dont understand that this is not a RM fanpage/club. I hope you keep expressing your oppinion.    All I can say is this: If you are true RM fans you would notice how freaking tired this cast looks and has looked for the last 50 episodes. They are bored beyond by their own program."
koreanvariety,34ry4u,sfoura,3,Sat May 9 20:28:26 2015 UTC,"Running Man has never been more popular internationally. They just held multiple fanmeets in other countries. SJH/KJK are two of the biggest Hallyu stars in China. They just had a spinoff show... RM still makes a TON of money for SBS.  Yes, the ratings have dropped but that's due to Real Man's persistent popularity eating into their timeslot viewership. RM faces heavy heavy competition from both 1N2D and Real Man so ofc the rating is going to drop significantly. Do you say the same thing about Real Man who is not that far ahead of Running Man in the ratings?  They aren't going to cancel RM because of an 8.0 rating. It'd have to get much worse for SBS to even consider killing one of the biggest Hallyu entities in SK."

koreanvariety,34ry4u,amelisa28,2,Tue May 5 10:02:18 2015 UTC,"While that is true and Kwang Soo is extremely popular in China (and many other countries in Asia), the large difference between those numbers of followers more likely is due to when the accounts were made. Kwang Soo's Weibo account was made in May 2012, while KJK's and SJH's opened in mid-September 2014 and mid-January 2015, respectively."
koreanvariety,34ry4u,khandiments,2,Tue May 5 19:44:10 2015 UTC,"Even if you look at non-chinese platforms like Twitter or Instagram, those who have opened it the longest are the ones with the most followers.

koreanvariety,34stn6,kkmnbgs,28,Mon May 4 07:03:27 2015 UTC,"Yoo Jae Suk has been thinking of retirement for a while now (see IC episode 300) and has been grooming some members to replace him.  The will be no the next Yoo Jae Suk since the era is changing. Rather than one main MC, the current trend is multiple co-hosts with more or less equal standing."
koreanvariety,34stn6,arumdayo,8,Mon May 4 09:57:13 2015 UTC,"He wasn't thinking of retirement on that episode.. He's just imagining that when he retired one of them must lead IC, so he made sure those two are ready.   But I think when he retired (or if somehow his popularity went down), IC will go down with him. Not the other way though."
koreanvariety,34stn6,ginastringr,3,Tue May 5 07:26:14 2015 UTC,"He is thinking of retirement, although not immediate but eventual. It’s in the same line of someone thinking “I’ll work for another x more years then I’ll retire for good. But before I retire, I’ll have to make sure my replacement ready.” And as you noticed, he’s been grooming certain members in both Infinity Challenge and Running Man as his successors."
koreanvariety,34stn6,arumdayo,3,Tue May 5 08:33:29 2015 UTC,"He's been grooming them to be variety personalities and being able to to carry their own shows but Running Man should end in the next few years and even if IC keeps going strong for another 10, the day YJS retires the show will probably end, too. There's no IC without Jae Suk."
koreanvariety,34stn6,AsnSensation,2,Tue May 5 12:34:36 2015 UTC,"I agree with what you said but in 5-10 years many things can happen, so there will be the next Yoo Jae Suk in the making."
koreanvariety,34stn6,qazwaxedc,10,Mon May 4 10:39:44 2015 UTC,"Don't jinx him, but he will eventually retire. I don't know who is if someone would be the next Jae Suk, we will have to wait."
koreanvariety,34stn6,deoxix,5,Mon May 4 12:45:37 2015 UTC,"I thought it was interesting because I was rewatching some of the old IC episodes and he was telling HongChul and HaHa how they have to replace him and the older members of IC when they retire and they have to become better then him and the others. It makes me understand why they picked Kwang Hee (even though Dongmin was probably the first choice) especially since he's a lot younger then the rest of them. That's why I don't understand why people are already writing him off before he even has a chance.  But even if King Yoo retires, his popularity will live on."
koreanvariety,34stn6,khandiments,9,Mon May 4 22:11:17 2015 UTC,"As people said YJS fame comes from the show he's on but I also think it's because he's a really smart guy. He makes great allies, supports his friends, stays humble, does not drink, is known as a great family man, gets along with the younger crowd, at the same time gets along with his seniors - but above all things he respects his fans.   I remember Dong Min complained about how nice YJS was to the fans when they were on ""I Am a Man"" together. YJS was so kind that he made Dong Min look like a jerk and Dong Min hated it. Haha...  YJS could be the greatest TV personality in the world but it's his attitude and personality outside the TV that also makes him just as famous and loved. He won't fall until he either retires or the end of the Earth comes."
koreanvariety,34stn6,Hitokiri2,8,Tue May 5 03:50:02 2015 UTC,"In the next 5-10 years... I see both of these guys already being groomed as the the next Yoo Jae suk.  Next YJS as an MC : Haha.  YJS himself has been grooming him for almost a decade to be the next nation's MC. It's all up to Haha now whether he want to be it, or keep being himself (a reggae artist/businessman).   Next YJS as a comedian : Lee Kwang Soo.  Same reason as Haha. Either fully commit as a comedian, or keep doing his acting."
koreanvariety,34stn6,usus789,4,Mon May 4 22:36:27 2015 UTC,"I agree, but I feel like it's the other way around, or at least the role of an MC applies to LKS more than the role of a comedian does. He gets along with people easily and because of his career as an actor, he's used to memorizing lines. There have been obvious times on RM when he's failed at MCing, but he seemed to do pretty well during his recent guesting on Inkigayo and during the last SBS Gayo Daejun and MAMAs. Plus, he's capable of being very respectful (especially when necessary) but is able to get responses out of people. However, it seems more like he'll stick to acting, though that may work out since it doesn't cancel out him MCing more in the future after YJS retires or something. It'll give him more time to practice too.   There's also always the chance that Haha could spend a bit of time as the next YJS while KS works up to it because of the 6 year age difference between them."
koreanvariety,34stn6,amelisa28,1 point,Mon May 4 23:39:43 2015 UTC,"When Haha was having his segment on Invisible Man, everyone was saying how bad of an MC he is, which he also agreed with and mentioned something about not being in his zone if it's a one on one talk show style situation and that he prefers ""yelling"" (something to this extent, if my mind remembers it correctly). Now, I understand that it was said as a joke, but there is a hint of honesty there. He gets very bashful and then compensates it by making loud jokes.

koreanvariety,34stn6,breakingfree,1 point,Tue May 5 10:41:33 2015 UTC,"he's doing pretty well on YamanTV. I feel his targeted audience is much more narrow, usually does well with children, teens and young adults, not so much with older cast or audience"
koreanvariety,34stn6,AIGOOOMONA,1 point,Sat May 9 03:18:13 2015 UTC,"Haha is good but not that good to replace YJS. i will put Hong Chul or even Hyung Don greater than Haha for that spot. he has good energy but if he wasn't paired with someone who is energetic like him(like ehem SJH n KG ehem), he will just fade into background. his style was pretty much the same almost all the time."
koreanvariety,34stn6,polidarida,1 point,Tue May 5 11:40:01 2015 UTC,"I feel YJS really tried to push NHC since the beginning of his career, he's the one who invited him to all his shows (Come to Play, IC). However, I see so much potential in Jung Hyun Dong, and he even complained that he never gets much help for his character from YJS. I love that guy honestly (although I usually like to root for underdogs) and I find him very natural."
koreanvariety,34stn6,AIGOOOMONA,10,Sat May 9 03:17:11 2015 UTC,"I've been questioning this too lately after reading into his back story more and more, about the years he spent on television before becoming popular. Makes you wonder if the 'next Yoo Jae Suk' is already on our screens..."
koreanvariety,34stn6,Jynxette,5,Mon May 4 07:41:16 2015 UTC,Yeah bro. His name is Jo Seho...  EDIT: It was a joke.
koreanvariety,34stn6,Just4Lulzz,3,Mon May 4 07:56:47 2015 UTC,"Jo Se Ho is one of my least favorite comedians. There are so many better than him. There is something extremely unnatural about him, like he is trying to follow the book and use very cheap ways. For example, I remember there was a guest on Roommate, and he asked if her father passed away which she said yes. She already looked really uncomfortable, but he said sorry then asked more questions. It's like as if he was very desperate for to get some articles for the show. She clearly did not look close to him, nor comfortable, she even ended up trying to avoid him later on. He's also touching Young Ji who looked very uncomfortable and cleary shows through her body language but can't say it because he is older and does not want to get bashed like Nana. Maybe Jo Se Ho is a great guy behind the scenes, who knows, but he seriously should try to read people better and stay decent."
koreanvariety,34stn6,AIGOOOMONA,5,Sat May 9 03:12:14 2015 UTC,In show biz no one stays on top forever. He's someone I wish a lot of good fortune to because he seems very genuine.
koreanvariety,34stn6,Fist2nuts,4,Mon May 4 18:10:33 2015 UTC,"Immediate downfall? It's going to take a hell of a scandal. Or one that will force him to leave all his programs.   Otherwise, he will stay popular until he retires. There also won't be a next yjs either. Program structure are changing and most shows will adapt multiple mc/host format as others have said. Or even a complete lack of a dedicated mc."
koreanvariety,34stn6,InfamousMike,7,Mon May 4 18:58:51 2015 UTC,"Tbh, With YJS, I would probably expect a health issue before I expect a scandal.   That being said, we don't typically see that many of them coming."
koreanvariety,34stn6,Ephriel,2,Mon May 4 21:43:57 2015 UTC,"I sometimes feel bad for him. I think he even wishes he got into scandal or make mistakes so people stop viewing him as a god and gives him so much pressure to live right, because he is a human after all. Then again, he knows how many shows and how much people put faith in him, and how if he gets kicked out, his shows and the cast/staff/crew will suffer also"
koreanvariety,34stn6,AIGOOOMONA,1 point,Sat May 9 03:20:00 2015 UTC,"I only feel bad for him because he has no privacy. He cannot go anywhere in public within Korea without being swarmed by people. That puts him and his family in a disadvantage as he will never be able to take his son to a local zoo, carnival, amusement park, any public attractions without people swarming. However, that is the price you pay to be a celebrity.   However, he knows full well he is a role model and have a lot of influence. I really like that he puts it into good use. For his latest variety show, he become mentor for some reject kids, teenagers that are lost and dont know what to do with their life and heading down a wrong path. The show is about him and his co host trying to correct them and put them back into the right path."
koreanvariety,34stn6,InfamousMike,4,Sat May 9 05:59:42 2015 UTC,No.   Simply put
koreanvariety,34stn6,LiteratiTempo,2,Mon May 4 15:22:46 2015 UTC,"His popularity is tied directly to the popularity of his shows. Not every show he touches turns to gold and lasts forever. It seems extremely unlikely he'll fall to a scandal. At some point many years from now he'll either retire, or his shows will end. That's when his popularity will go down. Father time is undefeated.  As for their being a ""next"" yoo, the question itself is wrong. It assumes there is going to be, or has to be, a next one. Think about other countries in the world. How many of them have individual people you can point out as the undisputed national television MC? The USA hasn't had anyone even remotely close since the days of Ed Sullivan and Johnny Carson.   There will always be TV shows, and they will have one or more MCs. It is not impossible that such a person could appear, but it is very unlikely, especially in the near future. If they are coming, they are nowhere in sight."

koreanvariety,34sb6c,Hitokiri2,11,Mon May 4 03:22:06 2015 UTC,"I find that JongHyun and SeungYeon couple seems very natural. They tend to give off a couple who's in love kind of feel compared to the other two, somewhat of a very innocent feel. I like how JongHyun is mesmerised by SeungYeon and she herself is slowly pulled in by JongHyun's Charm.  JaeRim and SoEun couple is my favourite so far. Their antics or flirty bickering really makes the show fun, they kinda remind me of Joon-Young and YuMi couple. They tend to show more cute skinship recently (etc SoEun kissing JaeRim's Hand after putting on lipstick). Sometimes though, not very often, I feel like it's one sided, more affection from JaeRim, but I can never tell clearly.   Henry and YeWon couple, their cutesy relationship has started to rub off on me recently. I was not really into their part, much like the NamGongMin and HongJin-Young couple, sometimes their antics makes me cringe, in a good way. Something that I feel similar when watching the Henry and YeWon couple as I did with NGM and HJY couple, is that the more I watch them, the more interested I am. It's like their charms are slowly sucking me in. Granted, I didn't really have a good impression of Henry from other Variety (etc roommate).  But that's all my opinion. Sorry if I offended anyone, and hope I can see what you guys think as well."
koreanvariety,34sb6c,JunYiDeWorld,0,Mon May 4 07:30:01 2015 UTC,"Henry is really funny, I haven't watched WGM much or Real Men so I don't really keep in touch with what he does (except really popular cuts that were floating around)  But I saw this episode from Happy Together, the special was called ""What's Your Name?"" and it was so hilarious! Everything he said was making me laugh. I also saw him on Weekly Idol and he was just really impressive on that as well. Donnie was so surprised with him playing the violin. He seems like a very funny guy.  I think on RoomMate he was portrayed as really... really creepy. It was weird. But I've seen him as a guest on a bunch of other variety shows, just those were the most memorable and he seems like a genuinely funny, sweet guy."
koreanvariety,34sb6c,khandiments,1 point,Mon May 4 22:51:49 2015 UTC,"I know right? I first saw him in Roommate and I find him a bit (a lot) creepy and kinda rude(?). Then I saw him in WGM after, seeing how he seems different, I don't know which(In roommate or in WGM) of his character is an act. That's just all my opinion, I do intend to know him more (or just watch more variety show of him happy together etc) before I say anything more. Thanks for letting me know your opinion and sorry if I offended anyone. Have a good day :)"
koreanvariety,34sb6c,JunYiDeWorld,1 point,Tue May 5 15:20:52 2015 UTC,"You didn't offend me! No worries! He just seemed like the biggest creep, I think it's because he needs a new image? Because those episodes I linked were pretty old and that's sort of what shot him into the limelight as a, ""naive foreigner,"" so now I guess he's gearing towards creepy-womanizer-too forward? I dunno. I agree though, it was really weird and if I saw him for the first time on RoomMate I'd think he's weird as hell too haha."
koreanvariety,34sb6c,khandiments,4,Tue May 5 16:39:52 2015 UTC,"Jonghyun and Seungyeon are great, I think Jonghyun genuinely likes her, and she's slowly starting to like him more and more. Jaerim and Soeun are kind of boring now, but they used to be hilarious. Henry and Yewon, I just skip because Henry is annoying and fake. Yewon would probably be ok if it was another guy, but Henry just makes things too awkward and forced."

koreanvariety,34q768,franciswei,3,Sun May 3 16:12:50 2015 UTC,"Here's some (production) suggestion : If you didn't have budget at all, you can record audio with your phone, hid it in your shirt pocket. But be aware there will be cloth friction noise. But you have to sync them in post, easily enough with 3rd party plugin called pluraleyes (but it wasn't cheap). BUT IMO this approach didn't work well in fast paced production, this is the last attempt.  If you can spare some budget, just buy a wireless clip-on, it's cheap in my country, and i supposed it's more cheap in your country (well, depends on the quality). You can get a decent one under $30. Then again, you need separated recording device (plug in your phone/tablet/notebook.    Or you can make DIY Boomer Mic/Shotgun mic, just google it.      Regarding video: RM or any show that game related is multicam by nature, the point is to capture non repetitive moment. Multicam is your friend, set up correctly, it will save you tons of time editing, and make the production value higher. But, it has to be timecode based, otherwise, it will be  a painfull edit.  There are cheap way to do timecode based (it practically free, software wise): DSLRResycnc : http://www.videohelp.com/software/dslrsync https://www.facebook.com/DSLRsync Their actual mainsite is offline atm.    At the very minimum, use 3 camera, 1 act as master, the other two is on MCU or CU. Sync all them using that link above, read their manual.    Happy producing !"

Two weeks ago, Roommate Season 2's finale - 3.2%.  tvN's The Brave Teenagers (고교10대천왕) debuts at 1.085%.   Competes with Crime Scene in the ~1% range but, to be clear, their target audiences are quite different.  MBC's Police 2015 (경찰청 사람들 2015) debuts at 3.6%.   Last week's Match Made in Heaven - 2.3%. Not sure if this show will live up to its predecessor's glory. The original show back in 1993-1999 actually managed to solve several criminal cases, with the producers/staff of the show personally aiding in the investigation and nabbing the suspects. Also, back then, docudramas were scarce. Thus, this show was trendy and fresh at the time.    Cancellations / Finales     KBS's Dugeun Dugeun India (listed as ""Exciting India"" on KBS World)   Ends as originally planned, with a total of 4 episodes. Episode 1 of Lady, Action will replace it next week.  KBS's The Human Condition 2.    Will be replaced by Human Condition 3.    Upcoming   KBS's 불후의 재발견 (roughly: Immortal Rediscovered), a 4 episode pilot show that is a spin-off of Immortal Songs, will air starting May 7 at 8:55 PM. It will spotlight the lives of several musicians that rose to popularity through Immortal Songs, including Ali, Moon Myung Jin, 4Men's Shin Yong Jae, and Son Seung Yeon. While it doesn't fall into any of the time slots in the tables above, reruns of the show will air in Human Condition 2's old spot until Season 3 starts on May 23.

If you watched the previous calendar delivery episodes, they went out to Russia, Vietnam and the  US to meet mostly Koreans. Think about it - the members need to film the deliveries speaking Korean, so that's why they wrote in Korean only. Anyhow, if you want to apply, they say that you need to 'apply NOW'. They will be delivering food. No cutoff dates specified."

koreanvariety,34hbar,themadbat,1 point,Sat May 2 00:35:42 2015 UTC,"I always hated the Yoomes Bond character because it represents the type of games/episodes I hate, specifically badly designed hidden missions / traitor mechanics. Failing at something spectacularly is a lot more satisfying to watch than succeeding at something boringly. There is nothing exciting about squirting water at nametags using an easily hidden water gun when nobody is suspecting you. There is no real tension because that stuff is  super easy to do.  I miss the early hidden missions in RM, specifically the one where they have to put ink on an unsuspecting gary's face, and the quiz with joong ki where the RM members already know the answers. The format is the opposite because it's basically like 7 traitors vs 1 (instead of 1 traitor vs 7), but the mission is a lot more silly and funny. This is what makes hidden missions interesting. Also, in the Joong Ki quiz, the members are actively trying to sabotage the game (DONATELLO!) and that made it even funnier.  These examples are lot better than those ""LOL I rip off your nametag while you had your back to me because you don't suspect a thing"" episodes. I'm absolutely baffled at how these kinds of episodes manage to be approved by the PD's. And it is also ridiculously easy to fix them. A few narrative changes will make these episodes work."

koreanvariety,34gjkm,aziaddict,9,Sat May 2 00:20:39 2015 UTC,"Some people say that Lord Yoo is the reason the ratings were able to stay high over time. That's true, but it's not directly because of him. Not every show he is on is automatically a huge success with incredible ratings. He has had shows fail in the past, and been on shows that had ratings decrease.   The reason the ratings are so high is because it's real talk with celebrities who are hot right now. And the reason that celebrities who are hot right now come onto the show, is because of Yoo Jae Suk.   The best example is Seo Taji appearing there. He specifically chose Happy Together to appear on because Jae Suk was there.   Think of it like any of the late night talk shows in the US. How did Letterman keep going for all those years? Not that many people actually want to see him. He's not really that funny. But because of who he is, big celebrities would agree to be on his show. It became a required place to visit when promoting."
koreanvariety,34gjkm,apreche,9,Fri May 1 03:18:03 2015 UTC,Yoo Jae suk...yes I know he wasn't there from the beginning
koreanvariety,34gjkm,Jeweles_07,4,Thu Apr 30 23:39:21 2015 UTC,the show only invite people that are currently the hot topic. this is probably the reason why the ratings are so high.
koreanvariety,34gjkm,ilangshot,6,Fri May 1 00:11:55 2015 UTC,"Talkshow concept will never gets old... and if the show has the best MC in the whole country, it'll be hard to get the show cancelled"
koreanvariety,34gjkm,ginastringr,3,Fri May 1 01:32:55 2015 UTC,"I've watched lots of Happy Together episodes, even those from the time when they were using the old and smaller sauna. I thought what was really good was that the Happy Together hosts had really good chemistry. Even though you don't get to see it in every episode now (like when Shim Bong Sun has left), they are very good at keeping the show going. For example, Park Mi-seon isn't very funny, but knows how to ask questions at the right time. She also knows what to add to the mood etc. I find that Park Myung Soo and her complement Yoo Jae Suk quite well. It's quite a risk to have different guests every week though it's the point of the show. It's remarkable that the show can keep going on with that kind of instability (because you don't know whether the guests can tell interesting stories or can't open up so well or whatever). Quite a number of episodes are a complete miss because the guests failed to entertain and the mcs have to make the most out of whatever they're given."
koreanvariety,34gjkm,sodiumwaste,1 point,Fri May 1 04:58:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah, honestly Happy Together is really unstable but it works. You are definitely right about the characters/concepts the MC's place. I never noticed that with Misun but now that you mention it, it makes complete sense.  I started watching when there was like the team of gagmen, then it got cut to three of the gagmen, then two, then just one, then Bong Sun got cut, then Seho and Shinyoung were added, but they're probably going to get cut too.  I also enjoyed Late Night Cafeteria, it was a cool segment.   But I still enjoy the show for the guests, especially if it's a guest I know. Sometimes I'm introduced to someone completely new from it, like Henry Lau from Super Junior's subunit or a recent one would be Lee Bum Soo's wife, Lee Yunjin. I've liked all the recent episodes as well, they've been really entertaining and funny."
koreanvariety,34gjkm,khandiments,3,Tue May 5 23:29:54 2015 UTC,"The writers and the producers of the show are doing a good job pre-interviewing the guests and setting up the questions. The MCs of the show also do a good job in setting the overall mood, making the guests comfortable, and asking impromptu questions based on the guests' responses."
koreanvariety,34gjkm,mkatter,2,Fri May 1 05:08:43 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure if it was this show, but as a kid I remember seeing an earlier version? (1st or 2nd season?) having people sit and get hit by a pan on a string that comes down or maybe it was 'Come to play' earlier version, either way it looked fun. I'm not Korean nor did I understand what was going on but Jae Suk drew me in, even back then I knew he was a great host lol.  Sorry for the slight off-topic post."

The show in its base is a interview talk show, so you don't that much money to produce (many of the guests will go even for free if they can promote things), you depend exclusively on guests so the public can expect your show to go like a sine good-bad-good... and not give up on viewing, people will always be curious about the guest so the format is never too old and finally you don't need big ratings to be considered a success."
koreanvariety,34gjkm,deoxix,1 point,Fri May 1 02:57:09 2015 UTC,Only correct answer: Because the ratings are good.
koreanvariety,34gjkm,0moe,-3,Fri May 1 00:03:20 2015 UTC,There's only been one constant at Happy Together and that Yoo Jaesuk. Yes the guest and things like Late Night Cafe helped but those have been changed over the years. Even the PD has been changed but Jaesuk stayed. He's the leader and constant of the show and that keeps the show going. That keeps ratings up and that's what keeps the conservations interesting.

I personally hate all streaming video, but it's just a matter of preference.  Anyway, the best way to do this is to sign up at AsiaTorrents, since they have HD uploads of all the episodes along with corresponding subtitle files. If you were to rip them from DF yourself (which is actually pretty easy using /u/schrobby's dfrip), you'd probably have to retime them to match up with the torrented HD video."

koreanvariety,34cv6x,amelisa28,2,Fri May 15 23:46:35 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure if these replies http://www.reddit.com/r/koreanvariety/comments/2xgbbp/running_man_where_can_i_get_isubs_version_of/cozvdbe have been among the opinions you've seen, but they do discuss several things that would be better to be read there than summarized in here. One of the participants of that discussion also mentioned downloading the MyKSN videos and the DF subs in order to watch them simultaneously, so if you don't mind that, that's a possible solution. There's also the option of not downloading the streams, but finding a specific MyKSN stream that is compatible with an extension that would allow the usage of personal subtitles, or in this case, a download srt file of the DF subtitles.  Anyway, if you prefer streams over downloading anything, I recommend streams of the MyKSN subs since more things tend to be translated (and superficially, I prefer their attempts of styling the translations of the on-screen text). There is the obvious problem involving the translation sometimes being poorly written, more frequently recently, but I personally don't mind that as much since I still get the general idea. Plus, if I need further clarification, it's easier and quicker to check DramaFever's transcript.   Since starting the show last year, after the release of new episodes, I've actually ended up just reading the DF transcript after watching the MyKSN subbed version since then I get both versions and it's not as time consuming as watching both of them. Sadly, that's been a bit more difficult the past few weeks since the MyKSN subs have been coming out later. Plus, for some reason, less dialogue is being subbed in comparison to the past. There are still a lot of moments when something is translated in the MyKSN version and is not in the DF version, but there have been more instances of clearly audible comments not being subbed in the MyKSN version, in addition to there not being as many translations of side comments that would have likely been translated before.  Unfortunately, there's also the issue of the quality and accessibility of the streams of both subs.   For the MyKSN subs: they've frequently changed blogs, so quite a few of their old posts featuring stream links have been lost. They still have the links to download them in their forums, but that's an inconvenience for spontaneous viewing.   For the DF subs: to watch their episodes in HD, you need a premium account (or enough premium credits, but that's also time consuming). They do have the streams on YouTube, but I've noticed the 720p there is of lesser quality than on certain other (free) streaming sites.   So while it is a good idea to support the original subbers, neither has a website I really prefer. With that being the case, I prefer to watch streams on KShowOnline or Runmanclub, depending on the episode. Both also have far more active, and therefore, interesting, comment sections, with the former being more active than the latter these days.  I would add that KShowOnline's streams are the best when it comes to efficiency, especially since they offer more options of full length episodes in HD. However, they more regularly have streams featuring the DramaFever subs, while the MyKSN subbed videos are usually scattered.   Recently, KShowOnline also added a separate link for 720p MyKSN streams (the LQ version is usually the only one available for free users on MyKSN until the 720p version is released later in the week), but before, the MyKSN stream would frequently end up being removed, so it's somewhat more difficult to find in the links for the older eps.    Whenever I would encounter that problem with older episodes, I'd go to check Runmanclub since they have the streams of the MyKSN subs for a lot of the episodes. There is a slight conflict with that now since at one point last year, Runmanclub stopped uploading the MyKSN versions. I personally didn't have as much of a problem with that since I'd already watched the MyKSN episodes the week of their release, but it was (and is) an issue when I'd want to rewatch the MyKSN version. So for a certain range of episodes, it's far more difficult to find streams of the MyKSN versions.   In the end, it would have to be about your preference, especially since both DF and MyKSN have questionable levels quality and quantity. There sort of is a third option: Viki's subs, but not all of their episodes are subbed, and again, there's the issue of streaming them in HD with a free account. The text also isn't styled, but the parts that are subbed are sometimes more accurately translated than DF's subtitles.   Oh, by the way, for the issue with background music, none of the subs are of any actual help with that, but this one Chinese RM fansite does compile lists of the music used in the episodes: http://www.runningman-fan.com/category/runningman-music"
koreanvariety,34cv6x,CraziedHair,5,Thu Apr 30 21:34:46 2015 UTC,I don't know what kshowonline uses but thats where I go to watch korean shows with eng subs
koreanvariety,34cv6x,Fist2nuts,1 point,Thu Apr 30 04:38:26 2015 UTC,Drama fever on YouTube. They have full hour and a half long episodes up to date. If you don't mind paying you can stream fully subbed episodes on their app. If you stream youtube through chrome cast you can skip all the commercials
koreanvariety,34cv6x,0moe,1 point,Thu Apr 30 04:49:48 2015 UTC,"The sidebar of this subreddit should be updated. Questions like this have are discussed all the time. Maybe something like ""Where to watch?"" Another idea would be a kind of community torrent with all RM episodes + DF subs, so you can download the subtitles quickly.   I dont understand how to rip something of Dramafever ( as its proposed in the sidebar) because if I had access to DF, why not use it in the first place? Its not even available in my country.   So, in short, the sidebar imo needs an update to be helpful to people and answer most frequent questions. Infos like SUbbing group or even encoding group is not relevant (although we are thankful to them). For example. KSO doesnt sub but would be the first place id look for things."

They will undergo various tests and the best players will be taken to Europe for further training. Ahn Jung Hwan is the MC of the program and I assume Lee Young Pyo will also make appearances.  edit: Registration is for ages 18 and up so maybe some of the younger applicants could still have hope (as longshots) to making it into one of the lower tiers of professional soccer.

koreanvariety,3471ui,breakingfree,1 point,Wed Apr 29 10:23:41 2015 UTC,"They definitely need someone at attacking position. They kept trying to switch players around and nothing really worked. Sangguk is lacking, Hyungdon is not particularly good either, Junghwan was a failed attempt - he's better at defence.   Not sure why Hodong is a setter on a starting team, he's too slow and his sets aren't stable. I'd definitely pick Jaehun. The difference between his and Hodong's setting was very noticeable."

koreanvariety,34635o,ShamDynasty,3,Tue Apr 28 16:35:20 2015 UTC,"Not every episode is subbed, however here is the most comprehensive torrent I've been able to find of episodes prior to 300 (roughly 100 of them). The video files are generally good quality (for such old episodes anyway) and it's all softsubs so any issues with sync can be fixed by messing with the sub delay on your video player. You need an AT account but registration is open right now so no need for an invite. There are a few very recent DDD subs not included since the torrent hasn't been updated in a while, you can get those by downloading the sub files from DDD's website then chasing down the raw either on AT or a Korean torrent site like Tosarang.  Edit: Oh there's also this list of subbed episodes which contains links to some episodes not included in that torrent, primarily because they were never released in a softsubs format. Often the videos linked there are low quality and the translations are very inconsistent, produced by a variety of groups partly fans of specific celebrities appearing so sometimes it's just cuts and not full episodes. Still it's worth looking at after you've chewed through the torrent (which mainly contains the extremely high quality DDD releases)."

If you watch Running Man then you can finish that episode's game in one episode, or two/three for special occasions.

koreanvariety,340pdw,platinum1004,1 point,Mon Apr 27 11:55:34 2015 UTC,"The thing, though, is that KwangSoo is the youngest. So, as a Korean, he would definitely be in constant 'listen to his elders' mode. I'm not saying he isn't or wouldn't be nice in general, but in Korean society, that's definitely expected. Giving up his seat, getting them food/drinks, etc, is what he is expected, and probably used to doing. What I do like, though, is how much it's obvious that they are all close and like a family anyway. All the time they have spent together means they are all close, but, still, KwangSoo is the youngest, and that comes with certain expectations on how he behaves around them.  And, yes, most Korean celebrities would display 'fake' manners. They have to: it's the whole face of Korean entertainment. Everything has to look good and nice."

koreanvariety,3401bv,Kairoro,1 point,Mon Apr 27 05:37:20 2015 UTC,I have only seen up to season 2 episode 9 subbed. And episode 9 was only subbed for 13 minutes. Couldn't find anything else.
koreanvariety,3401bv,Wilbii,1 point,Mon Apr 27 07:48:20 2015 UTC,"Ah yes.   So Hitmaker S2 pretty much ended with the Big Byung part. The subber finished off the episodes with Big Byung, but chose not to do the Chamsonyeo segment because I guess, they were doing it because they liked the cast of Big Byung.   I do believe though, that later on, someone had subbed an episode or two for the girls (if you do some looking around, they might be fully subbed, but I dunno) but it didn't get a lot of good feedback so they stopped.  As for the future of Big Byung, I'm not sure. I do remember something being said about it, but I don't really have a good recollection of it.   If they decided to do a third season... Well, I'm not sure but I'd like to see a new cast. I think it'd be a bit more fresh, rather than casting Big Byung again, (as much as I love these guys) and hopefully with members from different groups.  In any case, news about Hitmaker has died down as of recent so be careful of fan speculations and try not too have too many expectations, but yes, I too miss good ol' Big Byung."
koreanvariety,3401bv,TheSilencedKnight,2,Mon Apr 27 07:51:30 2015 UTC,"As far as I know, Big Byung had disbanded. They talk about it in an episode of Weekly Idol when both Big Byung and Camsonyeo are guests."
koreanvariety,33zwt2,Hammerraid,2,Mon Apr 27 04:45:32 2015 UTC,"(i just looked it up on google but) it seems like 4starsubs are the ones subbing sistar's showtime. it's highly likely that it's something about their staff, maybe they're busy with rl, rather than something else."
koreanvariety,33zwt2,kjpksc,2,Mon Apr 27 08:00:16 2015 UTC,"4starsubs are the only ones subbing the show, and while they seem to be fairly quick with doing the subbing, they're hilariously awful at uploading their fansubs.  They seem to refuse to acknowledge the fact that there are many other video hosts on the wide web other than youtube or dailymotion (which they seem reluctant to use because of DMCA takedown notices and whatnot), delaying by weeks evidently before they finally do try to upload it (usually to youtube anyway).  I can't understand why fansubbers just don't provide mirrors, with and without 'watch it online' options. Like really, give me a torrent option. I download my video from wherever place it's hosted and watch it with a video player of my choice as it is. And it's very unlikely torrents become inaccessable at the rate which youtube videos do."
koreanvariety,33zwt2,nighoblivion,1 point,Mon Apr 27 20:14:06 2015 UTC,"If you go to their website they explain why it's so slow, apparently college and exams so they are doing all that first. They said they plan to finish but it's going to be slow regardless because of their schedules."
koreanvariety,33zwt2,1stimefun,0,Wed Apr 29 00:38:56 2015 UTC,"Pretty sure it is just fan subbed, they don't have a regular schedule for subbing it, I am sure they have other things going on in real life which is why it isn't subbed ASAP"

koreanvariety,33vo6u,deoxix,6,Sun Apr 26 02:28:54 2015 UTC,"For everyone checking this, i would keep at eye for ""Producer"" because it's a drama not just about how a broadcast company works but more specifically about how variety shows works. For example Cha Tae Hyun has the role of the main PD for a fictitious all female cast ""2D1N season 4"" and IU has the role of a idol star casting for that show. They could have made a dramaland version of this, but having someone as Tae Hyun in the cast and the teasers which are pretty much variety-like (the teasers are literally the cast meeting in some places and talking about how they think the series is going to be, outside of character, with captions and so on) makes me think they're really going to do  a very fresh point of view on the issue."
koreanvariety,33vo6u,berryzsaya,1 point,Sun Apr 26 03:33:14 2015 UTC,So much potential to go full meta. I really hope they break the fourth wall here and there. I'm not much of a drama person as of late but I might watch this just for the meta. Hype.

koreanvariety,33vo6u,MNome,-2,Sun Apr 26 14:00:35 2015 UTC,I think it's might a bit of both but I also believe it's because people are getting tired of the show. I know internationally it's still VERY popular but in South Korea WGM has been on a landslide for a while. I think WGM is facing the same issue that Running Man might be going through.    The show is a long standing show with many fans but the ratings are low The logical thing to do is shut down the show but how about the backlash? Do they count the importance of the show with international fans?    It'll be interesting to see how happens to WGM if it stays like this.

koreanvariety,33mdo2,anxious_throwaway111,10,Mon Apr 27 03:31:41 2015 UTC,yes. He does one of the sickest plays in season 1.

I initially watched Crime Scene first and I had no idea about Hong Jin Ho at the time but I thought that this guy is really smart.

koreanvariety,33mdo2,dreamraine,6,Sun Apr 26 17:11:16 2015 UTC,Awesome episode~!  spoiler
koreanvariety,33mdo2,stijnx,5,Mon Apr 27 03:58:49 2015 UTC,That being pointed out made me believe it as well! They didn't even touch on it afterwards but that was a pretty big clue imo.
koreanvariety,33mdo2,breakingfree,7,Mon Apr 27 07:30:02 2015 UTC,Love how their photo-taking skills don't improve in the slightest from episode to episode!
koreanvariety,33mdo2,deoxix,2,Mon Apr 27 14:14:15 2015 UTC,At least it isn't a photo of half black half white. I guess they don't have a viewer on the cameras.
koreanvariety,33mdo2,onemorelight,10,Mon Apr 27 22:54:52 2015 UTC,"Thank thank thank you Bumdi <3  spoiler  I'm so curious about how Xiumin will do, especially because he's on three cases. I'm looking forward to the episodes."
koreanvariety,33mdo2,femacca,4,Sun Apr 26 21:27:39 2015 UTC,"spoiler Great job by both the production and cast! And I can't believe the season is almost halfway through, noooooooooo."
koreanvariety,33mdo2,deoxix,3,Mon Apr 27 02:42:33 2015 UTC,"I haven't seen the episode yet, did the said somewhere that were just going to be 8 episodes only? I can't find any news except was one post here (by you) saying there would be 12 episodes (http://www.reddit.com/r/koreanvariety/comments/2t4kex/crime_scene_returns_with_season_2_in_march/). Was it a rumor? (Now that i'm seeing it the other two facts were completely wrong, so that's something.)"
koreanvariety,33mdo2,femacca,2,Mon Apr 27 02:50:29 2015 UTC,Thanks for reminding! When they first announced they said it would be for 12 episodes. My memory is failing; I kept thinking this season was for 10 eps like last season. ㅜㅜ   And hope you get to watch this episode soon. The build up was good and the ending mindblowing.
koreanvariety,33mdo2,t2t2,2,Mon Apr 27 03:07:53 2015 UTC,"Bumdi's tumblr has spots for 13, but that might not be accurate"

koreanvariety,33mdo2,kyugi0923,4,Mon Apr 27 02:57:18 2015 UTC,Awww I really liked Hani's reaction in the end. You can totally tell that she really loves this game and is really into it! I love it when the cast really get into the game and take it super seriously. It's better to see them trying hard to take the game seriously than try to just appear to be funny or whatever like some of the cast/guests during season 1.
koreanvariety,33mdo2,Trn4mr,8,Mon Apr 27 05:08:59 2015 UTC,This episode was off the hook. It's hard to describe how good it was without knowing that much Korean. The sequence of things that happened make me really stoked about having English subs very soon.
koreanvariety,33mdo2,wannoe,1 point,Thu Apr 23 18:22:17 2015 UTC,Would you consider watching this from season 1? It looked like a giant game of clue when I watched a bit of the first episode but got kind of bored. Maybe if I watched guests that I like might help.
koreanvariety,33mdo2,Trn4mr,5,Thu Apr 23 23:43:19 2015 UTC,"If you meant the first episode of season 2, the format of that episode was completely different from all the others as a way to introduce the season 2 cast and was not representative of the show at all.  Season 2 has a slightly different format than season 1, but there's no real reason you have to watch season 1 first. Aside from the first few episodes of season 1 which were 1 case across 2 episodes, every episode is 1 case per episode so they're pretty standalone (but may contain minor spoilers when casts talk about who was arrested or something). I'd probably say watch an episode of s1 or s2e3 (s2e2 had a weird format the PDs experimented with for one episode that didn't really work) and see if you like the show."
koreanvariety,33mdo2,defenestratethis,1 point,Thu Apr 23 23:54:11 2015 UTC,"Should have specified, it was the first episode of season 1. It seemed like an interesting concept just different from the usual funny varieties I usually watch."
koreanvariety,33mdo2,Remindedyes,7,Fri Apr 24 00:32:58 2015 UTC,"I think the first four episodes (the first two cases) of season 1 were really rough. Everyone seemed like they were trying to figure out the chemistry between the cast and what kind of variety show this was going to be. The third case (ep. 5-6) with Minhyuk and the later episodes where it was one episode per case definitely helped pick up the pace, as did the increasingly inventive and involved clues the set designers started laying out.  I will say that I don't think the point of this variety is to make you ""laugh"" like most other varieties which is something I appreciate. For example, I generally am okay with Henry (I liked him on Masterchef, for example), but his antics on this show really frustrated me since I felt it actively distracted from the cast's attempts to solve the mystery. There's definitely still humor on the show (including one instance of one of the male cast members being stuck in a female role), but it's generally a much more serious show overall (which is understandable considering the subject matter). If you want to try watching season 1 I'd start with the Minhyuk episodes or after  (unless you like Henry's humor, which then watch Henry) since the general conceit is still roughly the same as in season 2.  If it helps the setting of the cases change quite a bit from case to case so if a murder in a household like episode 1 isn't your kind of thing, you may be more interested in another case (ep 3-4 is in a school, ep 5-6 is in an office, etc)."
koreanvariety,33mdo2,csmslt,1 point,Fri Apr 24 01:05:17 2015 UTC,"I agree. The concept for this show was very new and it took time for the cast to get used to it. It got better around episode 5 of season 1 and I think, so far, all the episodes of season 2 have been better than season 1."
koreanvariety,33mdo2,dattroll123,4,Fri Apr 24 19:10:12 2015 UTC,I've been watching since the start of season 1 (bless Bumdi) and this was one of the best episodes yet. So amazing.

koreanvariety,33mdo2,dattroll123,4,Sun Apr 26 20:47:51 2015 UTC,The Chinese subbed episode came out today for those who are interested. It has already garnered more than 7000 views since it came out 7 hours ago. Expect to see an even higher view count when EXO Xiumin comes on for E05 onwards for three episodes.  E04 was the best episode of the season thus far. Spoilers: spoiler
koreanvariety,33mdo2,dreamraine,2,Fri Apr 24 09:16:41 2015 UTC,I'm tempted to watch it Chinese subbed just to figure out if I understand some of it.  SPOILERS: spoiler  I did not know Xiumin was on for three episodes.
koreanvariety,33mdo2,Bananauyu,2,Fri Apr 24 16:36:20 2015 UTC,just watched the chinese subs. (I will watch the eng subs later since i'm slow at reading simplified chinese)    HOLY SHIT best episode yet heavy spoilers

koreanvariety,33m7ug,anxious_throwaway111,10,Thu Apr 23 17:38:39 2015 UTC,Amazing episode. Enough said haha. The model/trainer is so sexy. That body hhaa   And that chef was 10/10.  I'm glad they didn't focus all the attention on suzy. I love her but god yoo did a great job of getting everyone to talk. Seo woo just a little less but she isn't promoting anything tho.
koreanvariety,33m7ug,i_love_all,3,Thu Apr 23 17:56:06 2015 UTC,"I get a Clara vibe from her though & she hasn't been too smart with what she's been saying. Gotta admit she does have a great bod though!  Seo Woo was funny when she appeared on RM at least, overall this was a really funny episode!"
koreanvariety,33m7ug,gr1zzlybear,5,Thu Apr 23 21:36:32 2015 UTC,She seemed more genuine then Clara imo
koreanvariety,33m7ug,i_love_all,2,Thu Apr 23 21:39:26 2015 UTC,I really hope so! Hope she doesn't rush into everything though esp acting
koreanvariety,33m7ug,gr1zzlybear,1 point,Thu Apr 23 21:47:21 2015 UTC,"I don't like her once she said that she used scholarship for plastic surgery, that is borderline crime. I'm sure a lot of people need that scholarship, but she just used it for something like that."
koreanvariety,33m7ug,ginastringr,7,Fri Apr 24 04:51:22 2015 UTC,"Is it just me or has the latest Happy Together episodes been REALLY good? I really, really enjoyed the last one too. And this episode almost gave me a throwback to the Late Night Cafeteria era haha."
koreanvariety,33m7ug,khandiments,5,Fri Apr 24 03:16:08 2015 UTC,I agree. The interactions have been just great and hilarious.
koreanvariety,33m7ug,Hitokiri2,6,Fri Apr 24 03:25:20 2015 UTC,"I always wondered this , but why does YJS and the others wear those wigs? Is it like an inside joke the show has or some kind of korean custom?"
koreanvariety,33m7ug,Faze717,2,Fri Apr 24 06:44:42 2015 UTC,"Lmao, I never knew it was a wig until I watched that What's Your Name special because I didn't know who Myung Soo was, since at the time I didn't watch IC or watch RM consistently (I did know who Jae Suk was, but I just thought he permed his hair.)  I just remember being like, 'woah.. I've never seen an asian person with that sort-of hair.' when looking at Myung Soo haha."
koreanvariety,33m7ug,khandiments,1 point,Fri Apr 24 23:31:44 2015 UTC,"When season 3 of Happy together was pretty new, there was a section where the MCs would try to make the guests laugh and if you laugh, you will be shot with a water gun. Normally, they will do that by making funny ""Korean mother/grandmother"" talk and that is why they have their wigs which make them look like Korean mothers. Yoo jae suk and Park Myung Soo are the only 2 MCs who have remained with the show since season 3 started.  If you watch the earlier episodes of season 3, you should be able to see it."
koreanvariety,33m7ug,faustlim,1 point,Sun Apr 26 17:22:47 2015 UTC,were they always in a sauna also? i feel like the wigs/sauna/other stuff are all these years-old inside jokes carried over.

koreanvariety,33m7ug,aythrow,3,Thu Apr 23 19:16:11 2015 UTC,Suzy's Misun and Seho drawings remind me of the titans from Attack on Titan. She's pretty good.
koreanvariety,33m7ug,TTF_KSexy,3,Fri Apr 24 09:06:20 2015 UTC,Suzy fielded the relationship questions like a champ. Such a great attitude. I like her even more now.

koreanvariety,33mb4d,jsrave,11,Thu Apr 23 18:02:35 2015 UTC,"He'll be able to come back if he really wants to. There are people who have done far worse things that are able to be on broadcast and make their comebacks. Not trying to excuse his DUI which is a terrible thing, but it seems like he truly has been repentant of his actions, he's apologized numerous times, and I trust his support system, esp the IC hyungs who really care for him."
koreanvariety,33mb4d,gr1zzlybear,11,Thu Apr 23 18:05:07 2015 UTC,"Right now it seems like he's exploring a bit of life and doing stuff he wants (Euro trip etc). Its more a question of when he decides to return.   I have 2 ideas of how he'd return.  My first guess is eventually after a big project with Kwanghee ends and they thank him for being 6th man blah blah, they re introduce him.   Or he shows up in the action movie thing with Mudo company as a villian or an ending cameo."
koreanvariety,33mb4d,themadbat,3,Thu Apr 23 18:32:05 2015 UTC,"While I agree that your second idea is god damn awesome, I don't think the IC prod team is going to do it. They will make NHC's return humble and start first with a sincere apology or else they will never hear the end from the netizens >_<"
koreanvariety,33mb4d,alastoris,1 point,Fri Apr 24 09:39:39 2015 UTC,2nd idea would be fantastic!   Or Kwanghee needs to go do his military and they bring him back in so they have a 6th again.
koreanvariety,33mb4d,alastoris,2,Thu Apr 23 18:39:36 2015 UTC,"I swear every IC fan would go crazy if that happened, after the end of the action mudo he shows up in some sort of cameo or as a teaser for the sequel."
koreanvariety,33mb4d,khandiments,1 point,Thu Apr 23 18:44:17 2015 UTC,"Well, he would need to come back with a bang. It's a great idea for him!"
koreanvariety,33mb4d,alastoris,2,Thu Apr 23 19:01:54 2015 UTC,"I was just watching the 300th episode special and Jae Suk was talking to Haha and Hong Chul about how when he and the other older members retire, they need to carry the torch and things like that. I can see why they did recruit Kwang Hee now, since he's a bit younger and it would make sense. Plus with JDM out (who I think would have won if it weren't for the scandal) Kwanghee was the best choice. I don't want Kwanghee to be replaced, because we haven't even gotten a chance to see what he could bring to the table. But I would love to see NHC or Gil to come back, whether it's in a special or permanently. Kind of the same way I'd love to see Song Joong Ki to come back to RM. Even though it's all a long shot."
koreanvariety,33mb4d,khandiments,3,Fri Apr 24 23:37:29 2015 UTC,"I don't want Kwanghee to be replaced either. But that can be a reentry strategy for Hong Chul. After 2 years, KwangHee can be welcome back as Haha was. I don't know who they'll get to carry the torch. But whom ever that got the Main MC's job (YJS) will have a terrible time being compared left, right, and center to the legacy YJS left behind."
koreanvariety,33mb4d,i_love_all,1 point,Fri Apr 24 23:40:51 2015 UTC,"Man, I can't even fathom YJS leaving. I just love him too much. But you're so right, I didn't even think about that."

koreanvariety,33mb4d,IClurker,3,Thu Apr 23 18:14:24 2015 UTC,The usual reflection period for DUI is 1 year. It has barely been half a year so we'll have to wait a while. People also speculated that he might likely return on another programme first (e.g. I Live Alone) before IC. Anyway it has been a year for Gil but no updates =( I miss him too. I hope my worst fear won't come true. =(((
koreanvariety,33mb4d,kpgfisty,3,Fri Apr 24 09:06:22 2015 UTC,"Honestly what else could he have said? It would put pressure on MuDo if he said he wanted to return right now. Kwanghee needs some time to grow. I'm sure NHC will return the day it feels appropriate. I'm dying for him to get back as well, I keep thinking ""what would NHC have done?"" every other episode."

Usually just segments and skits."
koreanvariety,33jocw,Hitokiri2,22,Thu Apr 23 01:39:23 2015 UTC,"Kim Jun Ho, 2014 Daesang winner and former founder of CoKo Entertainment. The first time I saw him was on Ulzzang Shidae. He was not famous then and I thought he was a decent comedian. In just the next few years, he became popular and eventually landed a ton of gigs. His face appeared day and night on every television in front of millions of South Korean citizens. My love for him could have ended with the reason of him being a well known MC. However, during the recent filming of 1 Night 2 Days, I cried watching him went under a hypnosis. That was when I realized... ah, this person is also a human. He brought me so many laughters and yet I cannot help him. He is in pain and yet he still smile for the viewers. I could only be happy if Kim Jun Ho is truly happy. I do not only love him, but I also respect him. When I visit Korea in the near future, I will definitely meet him. I have made it one of my goals to help this man as I know he is suffering financial difficulties right now. It might sound unrealistic, but I want to do something for him as a fan, that's the least I should do..."
koreanvariety,33jocw,Dawonbi,6,Thu Apr 23 02:49:53 2015 UTC,which ep was the hypnosis one? I really started to like Kim Junho in Human Condition 1...He has a very human side to him. It's so sad especially since his agency was doing well and he already had so many troubles from before. Hope things are picking up for him
koreanvariety,33jocw,dreamraine,6,Thu Apr 23 05:10:59 2015 UTC,It was this episode: @ the 32 minute mark. I got goosebumps while watching it.

You can argue he's barely an emcee but I think he's second to none with making people feel comfortable, his laugh is so genuine, and he's just such a personable guy that you can't help but like.   Without him, 1N2D would not be where it's at. Even in the mountain hiking episode where CTH has to sleep alone on the mountain, the members were talking about how it felt empty/Taehyun should be laughing or talking and they just slept lol."
koreanvariety,33jocw,gr1zzlybear,2,Thu Apr 23 08:36:58 2015 UTC,He was the reason I started watching 1N2D again after Ho Dong checked out. I love his presence.
koreanvariety,33jocw,theinternetpotato,19,Thu Apr 23 09:58:25 2015 UTC,"Kim Je-dong, i love all the eps hes in when he a  guest in shows  and whenever hes  with YJS they are a blast, which is why i was sad when he wasn't even interviewed(not that its IC fault its very much possible he refuse) for the sixth man. Sucks what happen to him in the past."
koreanvariety,33jocw,llionell,6,Thu Apr 23 03:31:37 2015 UTC,"I love Kim Jedong too. He's my second favourite after YJS. I think the top management of the TV stations are still hesitant in reinstating him as a main host given his political leanings. His current main hosting gig is with JTBC, not satellite TV. Even though he was in name a co-host of Healing Camp, his cut in every episode is pathetic, like less than a minute? He got even more screen time as a guest on I'm A Man.  For the younger generation, Lee Teuk is getting a lot of hosting opportunities. People said he could become a second YJS but I think it is still early to tell. It's never easy for an idol-turn-host so I'll reserve my judgement."
koreanvariety,33jocw,femacca,6,Thu Apr 23 07:30:59 2015 UTC,I used to like Kim Shinyoung back during the Invincible Youth days. But after the dog thing she hasn't been as funny as that era. Like.. she seems more defensive? Though I haven't actually seen her in a ton of other stuff recently.

koreanvariety,33jocw,Kyoraha,7,Thu Apr 23 02:27:05 2015 UTC,She found a dog and fed it wasabi or something and then she put the dog inside a plastic bag and threw it in a river. There was another comedian along with her. It was a really huge scandal because they said it during a radio interview.
koreanvariety,33jocw,leopetri,7,Thu Apr 23 02:41:34 2015 UTC,that's ugly. never knew about it. but i guessed something happened to her since she changed quite a lot since IY
koreanvariety,33jocw,mkatter,3,Thu Apr 23 03:20:18 2015 UTC,"The other comedian was Kim Tae Hyun. This happened back in 2007 so not that many people know about it. If it happened today, both of them would be completely cut from all broadcasts."
koreanvariety,33jocw,Kyoraha,1 point,Thu Apr 23 05:49:15 2015 UTC,Thanks for explaining. That is pretty bad especially since it was during a radio interview. It's one of those WTHeck moments.

While what Kim Shin Young did was a bad thing to do it's still way less severe than what Kim Tae Hyun did.
koreanvariety,33jocw,blacksiopao,10,Thu Apr 23 17:11:17 2015 UTC,"I actually think Eric Nam is really good for his age (26). It helps that he's hosting ASC which is in English so it's easy to see what he's doing but I honestly can't think of many MCs I'd rather have than him. He's a genuine good guy, which is a must for an MC, everybody likes and respects him, and he knows how to highlight other people and he also knows when to highlight himself and he knows how to make fun of himself, which are classic MC skills. It seems like hell controlling a live show like that sometimes but he's really good at it. He'll be good in 5-10 years I think."

It's annoying that most of the time she's hosting something there are lots of unfunny jokes about her weight, but that's not her doing. She is very much like some people I know who are like second mothers to me. Also she's very talented and has a great personality. I wish we could see her more often."
koreanvariety,33jocw,boxich,1 point,Thu Apr 23 03:33:26 2015 UTC,My girlfriend likes watching Hello Counselor and I always feel sorry for Yeongja because she's always making fun of her weight and her eating habits. I know she's trying to be funny but does she have to sacrifice her image in order to make others laugh. I think she was more popular a few years back but its pretty tough being a female emcee these days.
koreanvariety,33jocw,I_Plunder_Booty,1 point,Thu Apr 23 05:06:18 2015 UTC,While I don't like the constant fat jokes either I find it hard to feel sorry for her considering her past. Deceiving and preying on the desperate just to make a quick buck? Not OK in my book.
koreanvariety,33jocw,AsnSensation,3,Thu Apr 23 09:55:10 2015 UTC,Jun Hyun-moo. Im suprised nobody mentioned him. Hes a huge talent in my opinion. Hes the Nr 2 MC for me in korea behind Jae Suk.

He has been doing that ""shouting"" style 20 years and it's not really effective all the time.  It worked really well when he was emceeing on X-Man because Ji Sang Ryul and Park Myung Soo will also shout back at him.  Then hilarity ensues when everyone tries to stop them from ""fighting."""

koreanvariety,33jedg,alastoris,3,Thu Apr 23 00:24:14 2015 UTC,Erm. Why are you yelling at me? There are people that likes the show. You should think of the show as a drama that has no plot and focus only on the romance and celebrity life.

koreanvariety,33jedg,tronatula,3,Fri Apr 24 03:47:25 2015 UTC,"By your standard, most shows should be cancelled then. All dramas are fake as actors and actress follows a script; All movies are fake as they also follow a script.   I don't watch the show anymore but I do see its appeal to others. You don't imagine your boyfriend giving you fake love because the boyfriend is fake to begin with. The people on the show aren't dating. Outside the show, they don't claim they're together anymore than actors and actress of love interest in dramas claim they do."

koreanvariety,33jedg,tronatula,1 point,Fri Apr 24 07:09:03 2015 UTC,Doubt it. They might sleep over for a day but even that I'm not sure of since they usually cut and paste scene together. In shows like Roommate you can see people sleeping over night and see that they're literally wearing the same clothes as the night before sometimes. In WGM...not so much.
koreanvariety,33jedg,Hitokiri2,1 point,Fri Apr 24 07:22:24 2015 UTC,"I think at most they might spend 1-2 nights a week in the show house. Otherwise, I'd think you see a lot more non-mission footage. Yura and Jonghyun were ""surprised"" multiple times, when they came back to find their house had been moved or altered. Hard to be surprised, if you're living there 24/7.  Most of the participants seem to move in with just one or two bags. That wouldn't even cover shoes for most of these people. The homes are usually pre-furnished or the couples are shown buying furniture and supplies after they move in. I've never seen anyone move in with a lot of personal items."
koreanvariety,33jedg,gatchaman_ken,1 point,Thu Apr 23 01:15:15 2015 UTC,"WGM is normally shot once every two weeks (so 2 episodes worth of shooting each time, which you can see by the activities/locations varying more or less at that periodicity). Sometimes, less often than that if a member of the cast is unavailable (older peoples might remember SeoHyun getting angry after YongHwa for not contacting during a whole month, with no shooting happening).  The shooting seems to last one day or two days-one night depending on the setting. I would assume that most of those nights, they don't sleep in that room anyway. As alastoris said, this is a set; they go under the covers for shooting and get up once the light is switched off and the camera are stopped. The only shot with a pair sleeping I can remember of is the recent JongHyun/SeungYeon scene at the ryokan. Otherwise, they are only shooting cast waking up (sure, I bet the 6-10 persons crew coming in the house/room with their hardware did not wake you up before that shot), or one sleeping while the other is active in the house. It's pure entertainment; you have to remember that except a few self-shot scene, they have a whole team in front of them all the time and expecting them to produce good images.  As an example, in the aforementioned scene at the ryokan, look at the time when JongHyun wake up. What do you have? A camera doing a dynamic close shot at his face. So there is someone in the room with a camera; this is not a fixed camera. They are not alone so I would doubt they are waking up just now and the cameraman was here waiting for hours for them to wake up ;-)"
koreanvariety,33jedg,Ekken1,1 point,Thu Apr 23 06:56:27 2015 UTC,"Another example may be Hong Jin Yong and Nam Goong Min, when they slept in the same bed so they could wake up for the sun rise.  Also, I thought it was a fixed camera that just zoomed in on him"
koreanvariety,33jedg,Uanaka,1 point,Thu Apr 23 12:24:10 2015 UTC,"I have not watched their cuts but I read they kissed on the show, so they might have felt comfortable enough.  Possible but unlikely: in the scene, all night shots are done with two cameras (one on the coffee table, one in the corner of the room, very high, both being on the same side of the room and totally static). This shot is made from the other side of the room, it moves slightly even ignoring the zoom, and on a shot from the camera in the corner, you can see that there is something obstructing some sunshine that is moving and I would assert that it is the cameraman as the window was not open so no wind to move curtains or thing like this and they are too high for it being a tree (call me crazy for noticing these kinds of details but I work on images all days ^ ^ )."

Maybe I'm missing something but I wonder why its rating is consistently higher than Running Man and sometimes Real Men (I just realised they share the same initials RM!). Can someone point to me some of the better episodes from S3? Thanks!"
koreanvariety,33exs9,femacca,4,Wed Apr 22 15:55:33 2015 UTC,"I'd suggest watching from the beginning of S3, KBS has a playlist on their youtube channel. You can really watch the cast evolve from the first episode to now. 2D1N rarely has guests, so the show focuses on cast interaction, which might be why their ratings are good."
koreanvariety,33exs9,sdpp,3,Wed Apr 22 15:59:29 2015 UTC,"I agree with you. At first, I didn't really understand why 2D1N has better rating than RM. When I tried to watch from 1st episode of 2D1N Season 3, I find that 2D1N is a good show."

koreanvariety,33exs9,gr1zzlybear,3,Wed Apr 22 17:48:25 2015 UTC,"The cast chemistry is so good. They don't rely on just bringing in guests for a ""wow!"" factor but they really work on their humor, Director Yu Hoijin is a hero/celebrity in his own right, and you get everything with 1N2D: body gags, slapstick, wordplay, confessions, physical/mental games...it's the complete package that children can watch and yet appeals to elders as well."
koreanvariety,33exs9,usus789,1 point,Thu Apr 23 08:40:42 2015 UTC,I had the same experience. Watched this show out of curiosity for their ratings.

Firstly, the smoking rates in Korea are crazy high, no one leaves a show for smoking-maybe they get a bad rep for doing something unhealthy but no one leaves as its way too common plus its not a crime so no blowback.  Secondly here are netz comments from an article.   [+ 8167, – 568] Korea’s probably the only country that is absurd enough to pixelate cigarettes in smoking scenes  [+ 7433, – 316] Lim Wonhee said on Real Men that he thought e-cigs don’t really apply as cigarettes so let’s just let this slide, it’s not like he committed a crime.  [+ 6659, – 268] I don’t really get what Ji Suk Jin or the staff did wrong. It’s a mistake, what’s getting on everyone’s nerves? Did they blow the smoke on you or bother you with its smell? ㅋ if you watch gangster flicks you’d all probably get lung cancer then ㅋ  Were comments from an article on this. Also this was a production mistake apparently as they were in between game members so JSJ thought that the scene wouldn't make it to TV."

As some of you might know its mandatory that males up to a certain age and ability must part take in the military for a minimum 2 years. While there many of them pick up smoking to ease nerves and to help them calm down. It also doesn't help that the cigs in the military are very cheap or pretty much free.

Imagine someone you care about is about to jump off a bridge. Of course you are going to want to try to stop them, and be very sad if you can't. When someone smokes they are poisoning themselves to death. Ecigs are probably less poison, but still not great. It's like they already jumped off the bridge, but they are falling very slowly.

koreanvariety,33fj6i,apreche,-7,Wed Apr 22 21:09:36 2015 UTC,I do not understand smoking in the middle of a game. To me it looks like they are in the middle of the game since every one is paying attention and even one guy is on the pool table reaching for the ball. Seems like ji suk ji is addicted to smoking to do it in the middle of filming. Which makes me think what other things get edited out.. Just remembered on talk shows how some of the guests actually bring beers next to theirs seats which caused controversy on some before.

koreanvariety,33d6zf,Kzpher,29,Tue Apr 21 15:58:33 2015 UTC,"He is taking these gigs because he knows he can fit it in his schedule. He is also one of the biggest star so he has a lot more freedom in choosing what jobs he will take. He's busy, but he can manage it just fine, and he's paid really well to do it.  Others have it a lot worse. I.E. the KPOP industry. If you aren't part of the top kpop idol groups, say hello to shitty slave contracts, almost zero freedom, and low pay."
koreanvariety,33d6zf,themadbat,12,Tue Apr 21 16:20:12 2015 UTC,"While that does seem like a crazy schedule, it's actually a bit less crazy than you think. Happy Together doesn't take all day. They usually start filming early in the morning, so he has the later part of the day.  Also, Running Man and Infinite Challenge don't always take multiple days to film. The latest episode of Running Man you can clearly see only took one day to film. Other times, like for foreign trips, they get multiple episodes out of a single filming. There are also weeks when shows don't air because of special occasions.   I'm not trying to say his schedule is light. It's still crazy, and he still works way too much. It's just not quite to the level of craziness suggested by OP.  I do know people here in NYC who work just as much. Personally, I like to keep it well under 40 hours a week if possible. 0 would be ideal. Probably why I'm not rich or famous."

koreanvariety,33d6zf,deoxix,8,Tue Apr 21 17:51:37 2015 UTC,"lol.. he makes lots of money. I am sure anyone active in variety shows would gladly take his place so I do not think there is a reason to feel bad for him. When running man first came out he was making $10,000 per episode and it was not even popular at that time, I think he is probably making more now.  With just MBC he earned $943,600 in 2008, $922,000 in 2007, $865,000 in 2006 (these numbers are straight from MBC so they are accurate). He is probably making $3,000,000 a year easily including other stations and with how popular korea is now."
koreanvariety,33d6zf,reddituser5k,7,Tue Apr 21 18:48:34 2015 UTC,"Yep, millions work those hours or more in much harsher conditions for a fraction of what he makes.  Not saying he doesn't have a great work ethic, but I'm not crying for him and his millions."

koreanvariety,33d6zf,Hitokiri2,6,Wed Apr 22 15:00:04 2015 UTC,It should be mentioned that Running man is mostly mondays and if it's monday+tuesday they have the week after off. Thursdays is the big IC filming and the other reserved days are because IC is obviously his most important project and in case some they need additional footage for certain segments but those days are mostly short filmings.

I think he still is super hardworking and deserves a break more than anyone but like he said in the Infinity Challenge documentary special (about ToToGa) he was basically unknown/took a break for 9 years. He says he's taken too long of a break and that's why he works so hard right now.  People act like he ignores/neglects his family but I don't think that's the case. I think they're a huge joy in his life and I think we the viewer can't see that, especially since he doesn't like mentioning his own family much on TV (wants to let them live normally)."

koreanvariety,33dw8c,CutieButt,6,Sun Apr 26 06:36:13 2015 UTC,"stop the over-the-top boisterous reaction, it's simply just not the style anymore. pick better shows, or at least a cast that he works well with. he just doesn't jive with the casts bc of his on-screen persona."
koreanvariety,33dw8c,kjpksc,3,Wed Apr 22 00:52:18 2015 UTC,"A wall of text awaits!  After he had to take a long break to calm down the public on his tax break scandal he hasn't been able to get back on his feet and to click on the button that made him so likable before. It's not difficult to understand that even today many people cannot avoid to think about it so he is a lot less valued and his personality traits are more hated. Also, while he was gone there was the final step of a definitive change on Mc hosting style towards more group hosting and a more calm and directed style.   Let me explain: 1N2D with Hodong style: Trying to express over-enthusiastically the pleasures of visiting new places, eating food, playing games and meeting new people as seen in the intros for example. A little more focus in individuals than in groups. Sense of duty to the show and a kind of have a debt with the public. A lot of plan changes mid-episodes with more freedom for the MC to do whatever he please (especially to cheat on the evil plans of the PD's). A more big MC (Hodong) to use his charisma, to present things and to talk to the PD.   1N2D season 3: No more presentation from the MC's; they are just as personas to experience (suffer) new things and talk about them. In some way more like Running man with a focus on trips. If you look at the intros in season 3 the PD and the post-editing does all the presentations and things they have to do. It's like a job more than a trip. All of them don't have a personality to break from what they're told to and are more focused while in groups. They still have that sense of duty (otherwise there wouldn't be on 1N2D) but they hide it. That is, while Hodong was very reticent to have a boat trip canceled for bad weather or to do something that would make him lose face (the traditional thinking), the season 3 cast doesn't seem to really care at all (although we know they should care because they have to perform well every week).   I miss from time to time the season 3 cast to be a more livelier or to have something to say on whatever they're doing but their style isn't bad, just different. As other pointed this ""experiencing"" things reality style more than creating things is on vogue today.   Hodong was very comfy on the old style not just on 1N2D but for example also in ""X-man"" (which was scripted but for example the ""Of course"" segment had more active participation than a full episode of todays running man where normally they don't need to be charming or do something special to be funny. Everybody could play the same games and still be funny unintentionally. Beware, that isn't bad, just different) or in ""Match made in heaven"" and now he doesn't have that kind of outlet.   Three of the recent shows he accepted to do and went out of the air were pretty boring and directionless as concepts and he hadn't the backup of the person who has more chemistry with him (Hodong line). He also doesn't have to have a say (like Jaesuk) on how to made them and is more limited to try to change things around so it's pretty easy to understand why he is sinking like the titanic except on two shows. One is star king which has been for a lot of time and has been consolidated and the other one is Cool kiz on the block which so focused on making matches impossible to win for a mediocre team that doesn't give any role at all to him.   What should he do? I don't even know. I think, for one, that he is perfectly fine on what he is, and the critics calling him outdated and noisy have only just seen his role reduced to a one-dimensional occasional character because of show constraints. He doesn't really seem to have a place nowadays and that's a shame."
koreanvariety,33dw8c,deoxix,2,Tue Apr 21 23:19:28 2015 UTC,"I think it's impossible, not just for him but it seems like it'll be hard for anyone else to achieve such a title these days. YJS is obviously unassailable for now but even looking to the future, is there anyone you could call an up and coming MC who might challenge for the title? Seems like most of the newer varieties that have really caught on have been moving away from MC-reliant formats, stuff like Superman/DWAYG and Kpop Star. Or at least towards a more ""collaborative"" hosting style where there isn't one or two main MCs and instead all the cast are on roughly the same level and the PDs propel things (like 1N2D).   As for Ho Dong becoming a national MC again, I think it's even less likely than someone else coming out of nowhere to grab the title. Tainted image, old-fashioned style, dearth of hit shows... Not looking good."
koreanvariety,33dw8c,Supplycrate,2,Tue Apr 21 21:45:18 2015 UTC,"He has to be willing to let others carry a show instead of always taking over.  Cool Kidz in the Block has worked (and consistently wins its timeslot) because 1. the show is centered around the sport (training/matches) 2. he has a large cast who takes attention away from him 3. most of the sports are team-oriented so, even when he sucks (most of the games), his screen time is minimal. He still can throw in funny comments with the best of them yet doesn't seem overexposed on the show.  Overall, his style is grating and outdated though. Even on Cool Kidz, there are times where he doesn't dial down the over-the-top MC work when he really should."

KHD seems kind of similar to Park Myung Soo in the sense that they need someone else to complement their style and humor (which YJS is pretty much godlike at).
koreanvariety,33dw8c,themadbat,2,Wed Apr 22 03:16:01 2015 UTC,"I don't think KHD will end up with YJS again because both became top MCs (at one point for KHD at least) and command high salaries.

Maybe try something new or exciting with his looks.   The reason why YJS is the nation's MC is not only because he's funny but many women find him attractive and sensitive. Many men find him to be a man's man sort of guy.   So Ho Dong....a new hair cut and kiss more babies. That'll show people you're willing to change and have a sensitive side to yourself.
koreanvariety,33dw8c,Hitokiri2,1 point,Wed Apr 22 15:05:28 2015 UTC,he can't. he doesn't fit in with the newer mc style tbh. watching the beginning of match made in heaven made me cringe because i could see that they were trying to a throwback to the old mc style but the screaming just doesn't work.  he's not witty or funny and he's just so loud. look at most of the popular programs rn and imagine him working in any of them? his style just doesn't fit in anymore. The MC style was changing and he wasn't but I think the forced break really just demonstrated the gap even further. I don't think he would even fit in 1n2d if he went on it now.

I used to love Running Man, but with these kind of concept it would be hard for Running Man to beat the other rival show (e.g. 1 Night 2 Days or Real Men). They could not just rely on cast or guest popularity. When I try to watch Running Man rival show, in my opinion Running Man deserve that rating. It's a fact that Running Man has huge International Fanbase, but if they don't innovate better concept, probably they will lose their Fanbase.   It's little bit disappointing when they use huge set, but they only use it for 10-30 seconds footage.  Sometimes I miss the hardship of Running Man mission :D  It's just my objective opinion #CMIIW"

Most people on this subreddit are watching it via subs on a 3rd party website.  I don't think it matters much either because 1) I don't think it's very likely to happen  2) It shouldn't affect the quality of the show (although the quality hasn't been too great recently)  3) If it's in a different time slot it can potentially get better ratings.   It's not like RM is in danger of being canceled. It's still the flagship variety show of SBS with a HUGE international fanbase, an extremely popular sister show (They got Fan BingBing on Hurry Up, Brother!), and the cast is still very popular."

koreanvariety,33b78p,deckard1985,10,Tue Apr 21 02:47:32 2015 UTC,"Roommate's international fanbase was NOWHERE as strong as Running Man. As I've stated before let's not forget that Running Man is not only aired in South Korea but many other countries overseas which SBS also gets money from. I think the international fanbase part of the reason why Running Man is still on or else it would have been cut a year ago with it's ratings were in the 7-8% average. That's is why Running Man does so much to create such a strong international fan base. Whether it's asking the international fans to create shows, taping shows outside of South Korea, making special appearances outside of Running Man, or talking to international fans on their SNS accounts - the international fans are becoming more and more important to the survival of Running Man IMO."

The former two do fantastic in terms of domestic audience but have rather miniscule international fanbases.   On the other hand, RM isn't that far behind Real Man in ratings yet is arguably THE premiere Hallyu entertainment show. KJK, SJH, and LKS are talked about and searched about as much as the top Hallyu actors/actresses and as much as most of the idols in China. That's huge for a company like SBS who cares about the benefits Hallyu.  I always argue the same thing with WGM. Dismal ratings but also has a large international following and that does matter and that's why it hasn't been cancelled yet.

koreanvariety,336klq,small_root,4,Wed Apr 22 17:31:25 2015 UTC,I liked this episode. We get short stories and experiences from the guests and members. It uses the games as a way to get to know them a bit more.  Also that game looks like a simulation on masturbation. You'll know which one I'm talking about.

koreanvariety,336klq,ginastringr,3,Mon Apr 20 18:53:42 2015 UTC,"93 minutes of Running Man... Sooo satisfying.    Too bad the rating gone below two digits. I don't understand, the show is always funny, there isn't a single bad comment from netizens too. But why.."
koreanvariety,336klq,deckard1985,-7,Tue Apr 21 01:20:53 2015 UTC,"because, its always the same, ""same characters"", ""same jokes"", ""same games with variations"", its becoming repetitive, they need a change in format and games, the games are more and more boring and the spy misions are really predictable. The RM spark its over now.  Some of the members are really lazy now, they only go there to get the paycheck like Kang Gary, if Gary talks 2 times in a episode its a record. If the show goes to 7% or 6% for a long weeks sbs will be changing the cast for sure and they will be make Running Man Season 2. 1n2d and real man change the cast and the ratings go up. Only the blind fans didn't see that."
koreanvariety,336klq,sodiumwaste,6,Tue Apr 21 01:38:01 2015 UTC,"What's your problem with Gary? Did he bang your wife or something? You've been mentioning gary the past few weeks.  If you look at the past episodes, you'll find that Gary hasn't been 'lazy' - it's just that he normally isn't witty enough to merit solo screentime. He's always in the background reacting etc. If you are going to attack Gary, might as well attack Ji Hyo who, like Gary, isn't suited to variety.   Stop calling the members lazy. They do talk and react but some of them aren't just suited to variety, so that's why you don't see them often throughout the episode. You can always see them try - Jihyo is always overreacting at things for example.  But I do agree with you - the RM spark isn't there anymore. A change should be in order - especially when it comes to the games. Members wise, I don't know. The international fanbase won't be too happy with changes. But if we review the members... I think Kim Jong Kook, Yoo Jae Suk and Lee Kwang Soo (though a bit predictable at times) have done pretty well. Ji Suk Jin is getting a lot of screentime, but I don't find him that entertaining (but if you do, that's good!). I think Ji Suk Jin isn't leading the way for the others as he should, as he's a senior gagman. Haha is kinda becoming a shadow of the character he took on in the earlier episodes. And as for Gary and Jihyo, I've already talked about them."
koreanvariety,336klq,polidarida,1 point,Tue Apr 21 04:34:00 2015 UTC,"I agree with your last paragraph. but changing concept/games is a lot easier to be said than done. it is because they need better concept but obviously, they already have come up with the best concept.  The simplest solution (maybe most effective too) is changing the cast. i know most RM fans would not like it but like deckard said it is always the same. game-wise, KJK is too perfect to compete with other cast since he has both brain and brawn.   There is not much the element of freshness in recent episodes. it can't be helped that the members have been better in RM games (which is why i miss the time when RM games looks really ridiculous). excluding ep242(the ep that they used fan ideas), RM element of freshness relies too much on the guests."
koreanvariety,336klq,polidarida,1 point,Tue Apr 21 14:50:59 2015 UTC,"having too much guests is really wrong too. some of the guests and members will just fade out to the background. i hope that they kept hving 2 or 3 guests at best. i always like when there are 3 teams of 3 bcos they can kept the interaction balanced between guests and members.  plus, from the latest ep, the mood and jokes between the two teams is very obviously at different level. it seems like the red teams are much more fun and hilarious while the blue team is just going for winning games."
koreanvariety,336klq,kyopda,1 point,Wed Apr 22 06:36:26 2015 UTC,"Although I agree with many of your points, I think we should give the staff a chance because they improved a lot from their previous efforts at least. They DID fix a lot of problems from the past year, and they are actually listening to viewer opinions to implement elimination games much more.  I know sometimes they do take their show in a lazy way by repeating their gold, mud, pressure mats all over, but it's understandable considering they have to come up with new ideas every week. But they are experimenting with new games like at this episode, and I believe they still do have talents provide excellent episodes like Ep. 239 if they are really up to it.  And trust me, new members aren't going to change anything. Do you remember what happened with Lizzy or KJK when he first came to FO? It takes a long time for the new members to assimilate to the environment and they will be attacked until that happens like Gil at IC. Also, if they are supposed to change their entire cast like 1N2D and Real Men did, that means there won't be YJS. And I don't have to tell what happened to FO at Season 2 when they took out YJS and the entire cast.   One thing RM members have over other shows is that everyone there is liked by people unlike some 1N2D members who got into controversies. They would do well if they are allowed to play against themselves instead of babysitting the guests at every episodes, so why change their chemistry? While I agree there are problems, it's something to be fixed with the general format of the show, not something drastic like changing the members."

koreanvariety,332yxj,deckard1985,3,Sun Apr 19 23:56:40 2015 UTC,"its quite sad that it really reached a rock bottom. The cast stops developing. At least in long running shows like Star King, Happy Together or IC, the cast changes or they are actually TALENTED entertainers who know how to and WANT to become better. However, the cast in Running Man, although I love them, they are getting lazy. They keep using the same jokes, the same storyline, things are incredibly scripted that I dont even want to watch it anymore. Fans will obviously deny it, sorry but Song Ji Hyo and Kang Gary and Kim Jong Kook are boring as fuck. They just go there to follow the script... Yea they work hard, but they dont want to experiment with their persona and character. It's not their main career, but still, they should at least try for the sake of the show. I was such a hardcore fan before, but I skip most parts of it, because I already know what happen. The spy missions will ALWAYS succeed because the members turn the blind eye to keep the flow or make it easier for the editing team. So predictable -_-"

koreanvariety,332yxj,femacca,1 point,Sun Apr 19 23:39:39 2015 UTC,"I would like to apologize beforehand if you might not be the best person to ask, but I'm curious if in any of the reports, are the starting/ending times frequently specified for the Sunday shows after the airing? Like I see several notes regarding times for certain shows, but beyond the general time slots, are the specific times ever reported?   For example, for the 6:20 slot (based on the Wiki info since I'm too lazy to search and use Google Translate on more trustworthy sites): 1N2D starts at 6:15, Real Men at 6:25, and Running Man at 6:10.  I only watch RM out of those three shows, so I don't know about the situation for the other two shows, but in the past 11 months of watching RM's live stream, I've noticed Running Man's starting time be more inconsistent during K-Pop Star 4's run.   When Roommate had still preceded Running Man, Running Man barely wavered from the 6:10 slot. There was only a significant delay of less than 10 minutes maybe once/twice after a special episode in Roommate. However, once K-Pop Star 4 started airing, the majority of the time, Running Man would end up starting at varying times between 6:17-6:27, once even at 6:3-something, and the length of the episodes also ended up being significantly shorter. Despite this, articles previewing an upcoming episode and the actual SBS schedule would still report the show's starting time at 6:10 (or even 6:00 on some sites).  Since I'd reluctantly become accustomed to the delayed starting time, I tuned into today's live stream shortly before 6:10 out of hope that maybe the time would be back to normal since K-Pop Star would only air a special today. To my surprise, Running Man had already started a few minutes before, presumably around 6:00. Today's episode also ended up being a normal length, so I was extremely pleased with that too.   But all of this does make me wonder how the starting time and length will be handled in the coming weeks since K-Pop Star 4 had somehow changed all of that during its run. While K-Pop Star 4 obviously majorly helped RM's ratings by keeping viewers tuned in afterwards, it made the starting time for Running Man really inconsistent (and it was never noted in previews). So I'm curious if any of the other competing shows were more or less consistent with their starting times, but I'm unaware if there's anything actually reporting the exact times.   Have you happened to come across anything that may clarify the situation with the other shows' starting times? Thank you ahead of time and apologies once again if you're unable to answer."

He ""introduced"" ZE:A and other members by himself. Yes, sometimes he's annoying and keep complaining but he's a natural for variety show.    I believe YJS will get the better out of him.

Please, take this as constructive criticism.  He isn't that good talking nor improvising nor has really anything to stand out. I have heard his joke of being jealous of his teammates and about having been plastic surgery from him like dozens of times in the last two years so he doesn't have really any new number. I feel he is too much act and too much reaction to the point is annoying. I liked his segment last week but the thing of seeing every person who is bad dressed and and going on a burst of laughter for 3 minutes like it was the funniest thing in the world was annoying as hell (and he does this a whole lot always). He has to go to the army in no that much time. I feel like this new role is too much big to him and i even feel that he has been more voted for his pretty appearance and silly voice and acts more than other more important things by fans of his group.

Sadly, I doubt any final candidates except Jang Dong-Min are capable of that job, and I don't think Kwang-Hee can take the pressure and attention at IC if he couldn't take such at Jungle or Kneeguru. So it's more likely he will add YJS more works trying to take care of him, instead of removing those from YJS which is his original purpose. He has to satisfy high expectations or end up as another Junjin to prove idols indeed don't work at IC.  It's very frustrating that Noh Hong-Chul had to leave the show in the first place, and I wished Tae-Ho PD should have picked his own member instead of asking viewer opinion. He can't satisfy everybody, and the list of candidates people came up was just disappointing. Are these final candidates really the most suitable entertainers for IC at all Korea?

He suddenly became overreacting and fake, busting out that weird exaggerated laugh. I hope he is just nervous because he has to lead a scene with JHD but man, he became annoying really fast.   His project, in theory, should be good. I don't know if I was biased already because I was annoyed with him that time but I found the whole segment to be unnecessarily mean spirited."
koreanvariety,331ht4,sportsteambfan,1 point,Sun Apr 19 03:11:42 2015 UTC,I pretty much agree with everything you wrote. I just don't see him as a fit.
koreanvariety,331ht4,apreche,6,Sun Apr 19 04:13:06 2015 UTC,"Kwanghee is a weird dude. I see him on a lot of shows. I can't think of many shows he hasn't been a guest on, so he has a ton of variety experience. Sometimes when he appears he is hilarious. Sometimes he's really annoying. I think it's really just about moderating his amount of screen time. There is such a thing as too much Kwanghee, but the right amount and he can be comedy gold. Good luck dude."
koreanvariety,331ht4,Hitokiri2,4,Sat Apr 18 20:58:25 2015 UTC,Congrats to him!
koreanvariety,331ht4,khandiments,4,Sat Apr 18 20:28:38 2015 UTC,"This is unpopular opinion, but I actually love Kwanghee! His parts in the last episode were the most entertaining content imo, but Dongmin had the better idea. I'm actually not surprised because as soon as the controversy arose, he was definitely going to be the second pick. I'm glad for him, this is going to be a huge opportunity I can't imagine how elated he's going to be. But I didn't know that this was for real and these guys were going to actually be replacements for Hong Chul and Gil."
koreanvariety,331ht4,pokeiman,11,Sun Apr 19 04:25:52 2015 UTC,He was really the only option after JDM tbh. I reaaally didn't want JDM so I'm happy.   I can see Kwanghee getting as much hate as Gil for awhile though. He'll have to weather through it and do his best.
koreanvariety,331ht4,jsrave,6,Sat Apr 18 17:00:45 2015 UTC,Gil got hate while being in the background. Kwanghee is a guy who always pushes himself forward and tries to make himself known.   Who do you think is going to garner more hate?
koreanvariety,331ht4,AIGOOOMONA,2,Sat Apr 18 19:21:49 2015 UTC,"Kwanghee is already getting hate for the speculations that his company is behind all the media play on Jang Dong Min. I know they are only rumors but I can't help but feeling suspicious. I mean I actually WANTED Jang Dong Min. I thought his idea was very interesting, and he is a smart and witty guy so he can adapt easily. Yes his joke was VERY distasteful but I mean people make mistakes on air, wether its his true persona OR NOT, we don't know him personally. And he already aknowledge he made a mistake and will probably never do it again or that kind of humor. Don't get why everyone has to be so anal and grudgy about it."
koreanvariety,331ht4,pokeiman,1 point,Tue Apr 21 00:12:00 2015 UTC,"Lol yeah I hope Kwanghee isn't that dumb. I feel like even he knows he's going to have to sit in the background for a bit and be careful because everyone will dissect every second of his airtime.   When he gets comfortable, I definitely see a few more scandals on the horizon. Maybe we're wrong? I feel like it doesn't get any bigger than IC when it comes to variety programs so maybe he'll put that ambitious side of himself on the backburner."
koreanvariety,331ht4,rsxstock,4,Sat Apr 18 20:58:22 2015 UTC,"Me too. Didnt like JDM even before the controversy because hes the loud angry type thats not funny. He doesnt have the cute ""babo"" side that pms does"
koreanvariety,331ht4,pokeiman,5,Sat Apr 18 19:19:15 2015 UTC,lol PMS's anger has a pathos to it  but yeah i find that PMS goes back and forth between being loud/angry and adorable/endearing. JDM lacks that quality.
koreanvariety,331ht4,stijnx,3,Sat Apr 18 20:56:19 2015 UTC,"We'll see how it goes but I'm pretty disappointed. Congrats to Kwanghee tho, big break for him."
koreanvariety,331ht4,femacca,5,Sat Apr 18 18:26:45 2015 UTC,"Congratulations to the chosen one. An obvious and probably the most suitable choice after JDM's exit.   All the best to IC for its 10th anniversary and onwards to its next new chapter! Kim Tae Ho, mansae!"
koreanvariety,331ht4,LunaeSol,2,Sat Apr 18 16:41:14 2015 UTC,"I didn't exactly like him on Running Man, but his performance on IC seems decent so far. Not as obnoxious as he used to be. Here's to hoping he'll be even better."
koreanvariety,331ht4,IClurker,2,Sat Apr 18 20:51:05 2015 UTC,"I tried my best to avoid being spoiled, but it couldn't be helped. I stumbled upon it elsewhere. When Dongmin pulled out, I had a feeling that Kwanghee would be picked as the Sixth Man. My first impressions of him are not very good, he's gonna take a while to grow on me. I did like his quips about Taeho. Overall he just rubs me the wrong way. I can't help but feel disappointed. I don't feel that he is a good choice, but I hope he can prove me wrong!"
koreanvariety,331ht4,velspar,2,Sun Apr 19 03:22:40 2015 UTC,"Congratulations for Kwanghee, but I feel he's Hobson's choice after JDM's withdrawal.  I have rooted for JDM ever since I saw him in The Genius S3 (specifically his actions in Episodes 5 and 8). I even went way back to search for Running Man Ep 13 where he was a guest together with Lizzy. Then I watched the show he did with YJS, ""I Am A Man"" and enjoyed his interactions there (all 21 episodes).  He also appeared in several episodes of Happy Together and his rough image is basically consistent throughout the years.  Ah well. Maybe when PMS retires, JDM can come back to take his spot."
koreanvariety,331ht4,beforeyourdawn,2,Sun Apr 19 12:37:11 2015 UTC,"Wow definitely spoiled it for myself. Anyways, I think he's really young and has the opportunity to grow as an IC member. It won't be easy to adjust and he will receive a lot of flack but I'm sure he can grow and mesh well with the members. Go Kwanghee!"
koreanvariety,331ht4,0moe,1 point,Sun Apr 19 13:11:37 2015 UTC,Does this mean the other two are definitely not going to return?!!?!?
koreanvariety,331ht4,IClurker,1 point,Sun Apr 19 01:12:31 2015 UTC,Not at all. It just won't happen anytime soon. They spoke at the beginning of the project that they needed another person for certain activities.
koreanvariety,331ht4,sirrenitee,1 point,Sun Apr 19 03:29:28 2015 UTC,"For some reason, I feel like the show is going to get more whinier. I think he should be able to pull off the Action Star Challenge since he is jealous of his other ZE:A members. But will chicken out on something crazy like the Wrestling Challenge."
koreanvariety,331ht4,pokeiman,2,Sat Apr 18 20:14:42 2015 UTC,definitely whinier! but it can't get worse than ji sangwook during his 3 minute portion of the sixth man project.
koreanvariety,331ht4,femacca,3,Sat Apr 18 20:59:28 2015 UTC,"Some of the 21 candidates were mind boggling choices. Like, Niel?! Really?"
koreanvariety,331ht4,cajunx,0,Sun Apr 19 02:50:29 2015 UTC,what i hate is that this is just an elaborate long con until kwanghee enlist in the army and hongchul can go back in. if dongmin is chosen it will be hard for hongchul to come back unless one of the original member leave.  just you wait many years later this scenario will come true

koreanvariety,333ly2,andy1413,1 point,Sun Apr 19 18:59:35 2015 UTC,You would expect foreigners to be popular but it's exactly the opposite. Alot of korean/japanese/chinese girls simply believe that relationships between foreigners will never work and are completely closed to it. That's just one part of it.  Julien just isn't oozing any charisma/funny/charming on this show. I think it's also the other male contestants reputation as higher end celebrities that also have him being shadowed out.   Daniel Snoeks would probably have a better chance.

koreanvariety,330f2g,SarcasticSarcophagus,2,Sat Apr 18 07:49:19 2015 UTC,"It reminds me of X-man so I can see why it's popular, but the problem with Heejun is that he acts like a 4th MC as opposed to a contestant which is kind of bizarre."
koreanvariety,330f2g,sportsteambfan,1 point,Mon Apr 20 04:49:47 2015 UTC,yeah there used to be a lot of love variety shows in the past but they fell out of fashion for whatever reason. I think the show they referenced in the beginning was Love Letter since Kang Ho Dong was the main MC of that. The blurred out face is probably Shin Jung Hwan since he's not allowed to be on tv anymore after his gambling controversies.
koreanvariety,330f2g,deoxix,2,Mon Apr 20 17:26:17 2015 UTC,"No, no, the show that appeared in a flashback at the beginning was in fact the old version of ""Match made in heaven"" also presented by Hodong."
koreanvariety,330f2g,sportsteambfan,1 point,Wed Apr 22 00:22:35 2015 UTC,OHHHHHHHHHH ok. Makes sense. No wonder I didn't recognize the ep. I guess that's what Love Letter was influenced by. That or KHD just uses the same style all the time.
koreanvariety,330f2g,sfoura,2,Wed Apr 22 03:45:55 2015 UTC,"Per usual, Fuijii Mina is out-of-worldly pretty. Good god _  glad this finally got subbed."
koreanvariety,330f2g,ToastGlitch,1 point,Sat Apr 18 20:45:19 2015 UTC,Henry is doing this show and WGM at the same time? Or is this before he join WGM?
koreanvariety,330f2g,CKtalon,3,Sat Apr 18 13:27:16 2015 UTC,Also this show is split into chapters. His chapter ends after episode 3. The 3 episodes were probably filmed in less than a week.  The next chapter has pretty much a different cast (other than the MCs).
koreanvariety,330f2g,bebicko,1 point,Sun Apr 19 05:54:44 2015 UTC,"This episode was filmed in February, so yes this was before he started filming WGM."

koreanvariety,32zjwr,YJSubs,6,Sat Apr 18 01:30:07 2015 UTC,"Yes! Once I have the measurements of the tag, I can deduce the total dimensions of each individual running man. Then my clone army is one step closer to reality."

koreanvariety,32zjwr,amelisa28,6,Sat Apr 18 03:08:19 2015 UTC,"Thanks a lot for sharing this. I'd heard that there had been some kind of dancing game during the filming outside (source: https://twitter.com/CNBYonghwa/status/582520298366357504), and based on the listed winners and pictures, it seemed like the grid game. But the footage shown of the round made me assume that the movement when the cast would switch spots had been mistaken for dancing. However, based on the original version of your suggestion, maybe that sighting was accurate and they did keep the dancing in the game.  Were you informed of whether it was kept or only knew about the final version after the airing of the episode (based on the footage shown)?  Either way, it's a shame that the round was cut, especially if the dancing was included since I can't recall ever not enjoying a game with dancing involved."

That was the part i confused about, I want to send my idea, but it wasn't enough for a whole episode (i only have 2 ideas;involving night goggles ).     So i didn't submit my email... :/     Oh well..maybe another day, if it ever come :/"
koreanvariety,32zjwr,BillyDuong,3,Sat Apr 18 01:35:12 2015 UTC,"I was confused about that part too, actually. I had seen the video of another fan-based idea of the full fledged episodes and didn't think mine would be chosen since it was only a single game being almost all text-based with only one image drawn in paint explaining the idea."
koreanvariety,32zjwr,determinedheart,4,Sat Apr 18 03:13:17 2015 UTC,I fell sorry for you when they cut your segment :/ But it's still awesome that your game was even on the show at all! Please do post an unboxing of your gift when you get it!

koreanvariety,32zjwr,jeozerkz,3,Sat Apr 18 02:01:39 2015 UTC,"It feels that it was cut due to the length of the game. From what clips were shown they had multiple rounds with everyone playing till there was only two. 10 people would equal 9 rounds and each round seems to take a bit of time. I assume your game took longer than they had anticipated and therefore was cut for time.  It sucks, but at least you got some recognition."
koreanvariety,32zjwr,Lecros,2,Tue Apr 21 17:21:03 2015 UTC,So how does the game go? I assume it was based on luck since that was how it was implied when jihyo won.
koreanvariety,32zjwr,Lecros,1 point,Sat Apr 18 02:30:10 2015 UTC,My original idea actually differed a lot from what they had the members doing. Here is my idea along with the crudely-drawn picture that was attached with the email: http://imgur.com/a/VJ1p9

The segment is ~20 min per episode so it shouldn't take as long as other shows. However, the other shows mentioned in the comments do have a larger following so they might be more worth it."

IMHO K-variety programmes worth subbing have been mentioned by other redditors many times before.

koreanvariety,32y0aj,Remindedyes,5,Sun Apr 19 14:38:14 2015 UTC,"Just throwing this out there, would you guys prefer to wait for this thread to be put up after the English subs are out or just keep doing it like it is now where the thread goes up whenever the raw comes out? I would personally prefer to wait until the subs come out because I think a later thread with English subs included would generate more discussion. In the last thread, there was one discussion chain about the actual episode itself. The rest of it was news about the show or something to do with bumdi.  I made a little straw poll to gauge how everyone else felt. If I'm alone in this, I'll gladly concede and do whatever the majority wants. http://strawpoll.me/4145629  I would also like for the sticky to last until the following week whenever the new ep comes up. There are only a handful of ""main"" shows for this sub and I wouldn't mind if the stickied threads last longer. I don't know. Just throwing ideas out there."
koreanvariety,32y0aj,sportsteambfan,7,Fri Apr 17 20:40:59 2015 UTC,"There are only three shows being stickied which is Running Man, Roommate and the latest is Crime Scene. No other shows have been added to the rotation of being stickied. Roommate is no longer in the equation as the show has ended. Now, it's just Running Man and Crime Scene. Half of the stickied time will be Crime Scene and Running Man."
koreanvariety,32y0aj,sportsteambfan,2,Fri Apr 17 20:50:05 2015 UTC,"Right, I understand but I would like to have both stickied at the same time and then replaced by new threads whenever the new episodes come out. I don't think it would clutter things up too much to have 2 stickied threads up at once. I'm just throwing it out there, if you think it's a bad idea then we don't have to do it.  I was just disappointed by the lack of discussion in the last crime scene thread given how much buzz there was in the pilot thread."
koreanvariety,32y0aj,ChinesePhil,5,Fri Apr 17 21:06:12 2015 UTC,"One, you can't have 2 stickied threads. Only one and that's just because of how Reddit is."

koreanvariety,32y0aj,ilangshot,6,Fri Apr 17 21:46:25 2015 UTC,"Last season (and with The Genius threads) I waited until subs were out due to reddit algorithms: It will only show up on front-page to people who have subscribed for ~24h from posting (depending on the amount of upvotes), and considering Bumdi usually takes ~72h, that's well off the frontpage and less likely for people to see subs are out if they don't consistantly visit here"
koreanvariety,32y0aj,onemorelight,2,Sat Apr 18 05:15:34 2015 UTC,"I honestly prefer seeing the Raw come out as soon as its available.   I watch it until I cant understand it anymore, then I wait for the English subs. it helps with studying korean xP"

koreanvariety,32v4xs,amelisa28,7,Thu Apr 16 23:39:01 2015 UTC,"I haven't seen anyone share this interview yet, and at this point, it seems like this will be the only English subbed version of it. So I thought I'd link it here since it's a pretty entertaining interview of Kook-Soo, and it also includes a few moments of (the return of) Framer Kwang Soo."
koreanvariety,32v4xs,Hitokiri2,4,Thu Apr 16 23:39:39 2015 UTC,"I know that there's been argument over - ""Is Kwang Soo really like that or is it an act?"". Either way to me it doesn't matter because he's doing fan service both ways. I'm sure he's a nice guy or else people wouldn't respect him as people do. I would love to go and drink with Kwang Soo, KJK, Gary, and HaHa one day. I would have a great time even though I wouldn't know what the heck they were saying."
koreanvariety,32v4xs,sirdrizzzle,6,Fri Apr 17 05:53:33 2015 UTC,"In my opinion, it's interesting to observe Kwang Soo's balance of confidence and humbleness. Quite a bit of it may be due to him being an actor, but the extreme levels of both remind me of a child-like innocence, so it's nostalgic and endearing.  I'm also always surprised by the extent of his interaction with the fans and his huge appreciation of them. There's a good chance it's because I don't follow news about him (JH is my biggest RM bias), but there was this post on IG recently that made me aww in real life: https://instagram.com/p/1VX8mAGbqL/ Part of me remains a bit skeptical about that post just because stories can be exaggerated, but there have been other instances that certainly don't contradict that kind of behavior.   For example, he, and probably Suk Jin as well, seems to be one of the RM members that becomes the most excited by fans at the airport, at least based on the amount of fans there. Plus, during the Race Start performances, I recall seeing footage of him going out into the audience (once to rows that were far away), and the other cast members having to call him back to the stage. The same happened when he'd climbed onto the truss and hung off it for a bit: the fans cheered, they were excited, he was excited, but the RM members had to remind him of an upcoming part in the song. I remember seeing another video too of him at the airport after the MAMAs, and based on videos of quite a few other celebrities passing by, it seemed like there was a serious rush for the flight. Out of those several videos of maybe a dozen (or less) celebs, I can only recall Kwang Soo and maybe two other celebrities having been able to step aside for autographs/pics, but I think Kwang Soo was about to get caught up in his major levels of appreciation again since Lee Dong Wook had to step in and guide him away (probably to not risk missing their flight).  I'm sure there have been far more notable instances, but those are the few I've heard that have really stood out in my mind. He really goes above and beyond with his fan service these days, and that level is a bit of a rare sight at this point in a celebrity's career (or any, depending on their personality). His fame is still obviously growing, especially as Kwang Soo the actor, so I hope if in the long run, when/if his level of excitement does diminish, it's because of time rather than a situation where a line was crossed. It would be a major shame otherwise. =/  EDIT: I did not realize how long this was until after posting it. Sorry for that. >.<"
koreanvariety,32svp3,Giiiraffe,2,Thu Apr 16 13:18:18 2015 UTC,I know its for the airtime and the show but Gyuri and Taeho were really unprofessional. It made me cringe when it was they snuck tasting the food.   Still karma paid it back when they were assigned as dishwashers :))

But isn't having physical exams with an endoscopy rather bad for final episode material? I mean, personally i'd rather not see that stuff anyway but I understand that it's a 'lifestyle' type of program."
koreanvariety,32na05,Kairoro,13,Wed Apr 15 23:45:21 2015 UTC,"It was one of the worst ""last episodes"" of any program, tbh. The PDs simply slapped some old, already filmed but never aired scenes together. Couldn't even be bothered to get the cast together one last time to properly say goodbye & for example show them packing up their stuff & clean the house together one last time while reminiscing about their time there. THAT would have been a simple way of making a proper final episode as a 'thank you' for the people who bothered to tune in each week. But it had been obvious for a long time that the PDs didn't care about the viewers & just tried to fill air-time with the least amount of effort from their side, i.e. just inviting guests for every episode. I'll miss the Roommate from the beginning of this season, but not the shadow of itself that the show had become in the end at the hands of thesethese incompetent PDs."
koreanvariety,32na05,NowBiggerAndBetter,4,Thu Apr 16 09:46:29 2015 UTC,"Yup, I guess we now know what it looks like when the PD's give up on their show.."
koreanvariety,32na05,Kairoro,5,Thu Apr 16 11:26:50 2015 UTC,"Yea, I think the ending with the gift exchange part was actually old footage too because the family portrait that the cast hung up had been there since episode 12 (Christmas special)."
koreanvariety,32na05,pinkquest,7,Thu Apr 16 07:03:48 2015 UTC,"It was definitely old footage, one dead giveaway is the fact that Joon still had his blonde hair when this was shot. Pathetic that the PDs used old footage that was probably shot for Christmas to make it seem like the cast exchanged ""parting gifts""."
koreanvariety,32na05,NowBiggerAndBetter,2,Thu Apr 16 09:50:46 2015 UTC,It felt like it was a rather rushed epd from normal. Somewhat 2 or 3 epd worth of material pushed into one.

I don't hate KwangHee (He's actually my favorite, read my comment on previous episode) but now that he's the strongest candidate after JDM is leaving, IF he's chosen, he'll get all the hate. That is why I think it's better not to get permanent member."
koreanvariety,32ljs3,breakingfree,-7,Wed Apr 15 05:10:52 2015 UTC,"Calling JDM ""the victim"" is a bit much. Just because lead broadcasting people think that these scandals and misogynist remarks don't deserve the same treatment as DUI/DWI scandals, doesn't mean they are right. It's Korea afterall, they know such remarks won't leave a lasting impact. It's just a shame that they keep holding onto these wicked ""comedians"", instead of giving a chance to some other comedians or rookies, because Dongmin, Myungsoo, Hongchul, Hyungdon, Seyoon aren't even funny most of the times. But that's a result of being known and being around for such a long time that it's hard to imagine the entertainment world without them."
koreanvariety,32ljs3,AIGOOOMONA,1 point,Wed Apr 15 07:12:06 2015 UTC,I completely disagree. Everyone keeps on suggesting that but don't you think that the cast and crew will be demoralized? Like they work on a project that never got its closure. I think they should just recruit Yoo Byun Jae. He seems thick skinned.

I know big reactions are important in variety but he needs to dial it back because it's driving me nuts. I find Gyun Sung's ""psycho"" act more tolerable now."
koreanvariety,32ljs3,pokeiman,7,Fri Apr 17 04:31:04 2015 UTC,Kwanghee was pretty funny especially when he was making fun of tae pd and I liked that yoo byung jae came back on the show lol. I actually really want to see Jang Dongmin's segment done all the way through but i don't want him to be the sixth man. I've always disliked him.

I don't get the short bob thing, what is their goal now? And Siwon was really great at first, but he's wearing off on me too."

koreanvariety,32ljs3,YJSubs,4,Wed Apr 15 03:06:21 2015 UTC,"My opinion on the projects:  Siwon: The worst project by far of all of them. There's nothing funny nor interesting to take away from this. Haha is now hating having to do 100 km by bike and siwon cannot make it alone interesting. There's not a focus on showing the city or the food or the weird concept of donations so the format is completely pointless. I'm too a bit tired of him being a one trick person and i know he can do better.   Jin Kyung: Without results, this is a bit meh and while i have a bias for her she doesn't have enough experience to make it worth watching although i appreciated how forward was in getting things done and leaving to hong kong now if it's necessary. I said before on the variety ideas thread but i still think that the idea of the 6 grades of separation (starting with one random person and everyone person meeting with a friend/family that they think is closer to the target). Just imagine the imprevisible of everything, to how many places they can travel, the favours they would have to do to have them to agree (better than asking them shamelessly)  and the build-up till the end (make it a 3-4 days time limit). In my mind it's perfect.   The debate idea she had is also pretty good. Take two popular foods or popular things people like to argue with (best snack, best city, mountain vs beach, best female idol) and make a big debate about it with popular campaigns, many celebrities involved and a huge debate episode IC style + voting of people neutral to the issue. The idea is viral, engaging and their debate episodes are impressively very good so this is a very good idea.    Kwanghee: His idea is not that solid for a IC episode and i didn't really liked at how everything they saw or heard in his segments were like the funniest thing in the world. One can be noisy and iC from time to time, but cannot be noisy and laughing all the time without a motive. Many international fans are putting him as the best candidates but i'm not one of them. He isn't that good talker (more adequate for a far secondary on a talk show) or decided or that charming/stand out from the other candidates (as the writer said this episode, he just forgot to vote for him). He will mature and better himself in a couple of year, i'm sure.   Dongmin: I still think the idea is too much aggressive and Dongmin is also too aggressive, calculative and thinking on everything he says while being very timid inside to be in the free-natural style of IC but until the scandal he was probably the best candidate and his project is the one with the most probability of being a semi-good idea and a huge success. We will have to wait to see if the storm dissapears and he backs on on his decision to retire.   Gyun Sung: Nothing more than the imitations and the bipolar style and two tricks will be running out soon. One person with more variety mentality and kind of interesting will beat him any day of the year. Agree with that he is being carried by Jae Suk and doesn't seem more than a guest (bad idea inviting 3 more people) . His project didn't even started yet so i will wait for the next episode but while the idea would be cool for the poor workers i don't think i will make good television (like in the last episodes of ""Invisible man"")"

But man, this episode was a zero. They should've stopped the series after the candidates made proposals, let the production team decide which candidate to use, and move on to other stuff. Splitting up members and have them pursue half-assed ideas is just so boring.   Just a little rant but man, Haha sucks as an MC. Whenever he has to lead a scene on his own, his confidence crumbles and he always has to rely on his shitty over-reacting, over-silly, character. I don't get it.

koreanvariety,32it8w,winterlane,1 point,Tue Apr 14 15:35:11 2015 UTC,"KPKF translated the interview it came from.   ""When I was in high school, I was desperate to 'bang' a girl. It wasn't exactly sex, but for skinship. I was desperate. I gathered information and the ways I could knock off women were drinking, sleeping pills, and pig estrus. But I gave up the third choice because it was hard to get it. I also gave up the second method because it wasn't easy to buy sleeping pills. I decided to use the first method. Liquor was good but expensive, and soju was ruining the mood. I went to a convenience store and bought a few kinds of strong alcohol. I mixed them up, tested, and found a good mixture. At that time, I was illegally tutored by an academy CEO. I borrowed the academy and had the girl over. I told her, ""I made this for you, drink slowly."" I expected her to lean on my shoulders, but instead, she started throwing up. I had to take her home without getting anything. The problem was the next day. People knew what kind of a person I was, so she found out what I was intending to do. She called me and cursed, ""you jerk, don't live like that @#$%&"" I tried hard but I only got the worst result."""

koreanvariety,32it8w,sportsteambfan,5,Tue Apr 14 04:02:09 2015 UTC,"I wrote this elsewhere and just copypasta here:  From what I read, the statements were taken way out of context. Ongdalsaem (JDM, YSM, YSY) were discussing about relationship cases that had been submitted to them on their small private radio show that only their fans would pay to listen to. One case in issue was that a girl compared her bf with her ex while they were doing 'it'. They were highly disapproving with such a behaviour and called her a bxxxx. About JDM's comment on his coordi, apparently the coordi was on the same programme when he made the comments and had laughed along with him because they all shared the same sick sense of humour. In these cases, he had already apologized on the programme in the subsequent episode in case people were offended. If you are familiar with Ongdalsaem, they were known to make outrageous and exaggerated remarks on their own tiny radio programme for laughs. This is why they always appeal more to the guys, but there are girls who like such stuff too. One girl even requested Jang Dongmin to record a clip of him cursing at her as a wedding gift - the sheer absurdity. You can say some people have weird fetish but this is not a crime after all, just personal preferences.  When this saga came up, there were suspicions of conspiracy against JDM because he was considered the most popular choice for Infinite Challenge's Sixth Man. He had since volunteered to withdraw from the special. And now there were now worse stuff about IC members being dug out that made his case almost trivial, like Junha's initial denial but subsequent confession of involvement with prostitution in his businesses; Myungsoo striking his ex-gf 100 times and said that it was difficult to lift his hand for the first time but subsequently it became easier; and Hongchul talking about a failed attempt at date-rape. This Sixth Man special and the programme had now become a sad mess."

Honestly, the other stuff you brought up is way more disgusting. I wonder how much of that is them exaggerating/doing offensive material and how much of it is true.

koreanvariety,32ijbn,myblindy,6,Tue Apr 14 01:51:19 2015 UTC,"There have only been two (pilot) episodes so far. It becomes a regular show starting April 25. And yeah, it seems like the subbed ones were deleted.  Anyways, ff anyone wants to get a preview of what's to come, they did the internet streams yesterday (April 12) and some people recorded and uploaded them. Here's Choa's stream for example: part 1, part 2.   It's 3 hours of content per streamer so I doubt these raw footages will ever get subbed. Maybe extremely dedicated AOA fans might sub Choa's. They'll sub her cuts from the TV airing at the very least."
koreanvariety,32ijbn,mkatter,6,Tue Apr 14 03:42:50 2015 UTC,Here's the subs for Choa's first pilot episode: http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x2lhpn0_armyofangels-150208-mbc-my-little-television-recording-session-aoa-choa-part1-1_fun  The latest show that had Jimin on as well was 3 hours I think so it's a pretty big project to sub them compared to other shows.
koreanvariety,32ijbn,ekoh8873,2,Tue Apr 14 14:26:10 2015 UTC,"!! Thank you! <3  I have no problem waiting, I was just curious if people were were doing it for sure (and more specifically which channels to watch for the subs)."

koreanvariety,32ejpt,mthrow_,6,Mon Apr 13 23:21:34 2015 UTC,"Did i read right? 2,205 entries for games. WOW. If they used like 1/10 of them they have enough good games for a year.   Edit: They were a bit too conservative with the ideas, playing versions of games already played and well known. For example ""What's the time, mr. wolf"" is very popular childrens game in anglophone countries (the segment was funny though), the water gun game is a version of the one with the toy hammer and they already played this with the water gun in 2D1N (after doing some elephant spins which as a fact makes everything funnier every time) and two games that appeared to be more interesting were cut out for the time (one played in a table about linking threads or something like that,i can't know with 5 seconds of footage, and some kind of lottery in which they fall to the ground from a platform if their number is announced). The final game is still of course a very good idea but it's the classic bells hide and seek. Also, and this is being picky, for this final game the proportion 3:7 is way too high for the chasers who can overwhelm 2 persons easily and make 3:5 quickly."
koreanvariety,32ejpt,deoxix,3,Mon Apr 13 17:56:55 2015 UTC,yeah the chasing team is always too OP when there's no way to eliminate them
koreanvariety,32ejpt,sportsteambfan,1 point,Wed Apr 15 23:01:06 2015 UTC,"Could be much much more submission if DF RM Fanpage (2.5 M) and KSN RM Fanpage (1.5 M) posting the announcement. DF DIDN'T posted the announcement at all, their RM fanpage just a front end for their KDrama release.    KSN, as usual, only caring about ad revenue. Me & some guy posted in KSN fanpage, because the deadline is 1 day left, and they didn't posted anything (instead posting WGM and some show instead). Then they started to posted the announcement, which is already too late. The funny thing is, they tricked fans, they didn't posted the actual video, just made an announcement, as if they were the official SBS RM fan page O_o. Yeah,..too bad KSN RM fanpage is being run by some shady dude."

koreanvariety,32ejpt,iTokki,7,Tue Apr 14 20:52:36 2015 UTC,"Wow this episode is such a throwback to the earlier episodes of Running Man where they didn't make over complicated games and let the cast's interaction carry the show. Was great to see Bells Hide-Seek, although I was sad to see Yonghwa be the first few to be eliminated. Yonghwa is probably my favorite guest since he actually seems to try really hard when it comes to playing the games and feels like part of the Running Man cast."

koreanvariety,32bc8k,mercurialheart,2,Sun Apr 12 17:34:41 2015 UTC,"I'm the opposite, Jong Hyun is far too awkward because either he is far to emotionally invested in Seung Yeon or is trying to play a character that is actually hopelessly in love. Seung Yeon on the other hand is approaching this at a more professional level and holding Jong Hyun in check whilst playing a role of a girl in love. In the end looks like a lecherous boy that happens to be an idol trying to get a girl that's not interested but acting interested for another cause."
koreanvariety,32bc8k,SarcasticSarcophagus,3,Mon Apr 13 01:43:50 2015 UTC,"Now, I find Henry to be playing the lecherous boy and over the top with it so I can't even watch his segments.   I think I like that Jong Hyun isn't going for the professional level and seems to be aiming for sincere. I rather he be awkward bc he may genuinely like Seung Yoo, than just awkward like his name predecessor.   Different strokes and all that. I also tried to watch SoLim...when did they get so boring?"
koreanvariety,32bc8k,mercurialheart,1 point,Mon Apr 13 14:42:36 2015 UTC,"SoLim started to die once the other couples left. Before they were the main attraction of the show, but now with Henry/Yewon being the outgoing couple and Jong Hyun/Seung Yeon bringing the innocent image, the producers have put them on a back seat. Plus, moving them to the country and having their segments about farming is not appealing to watch.  I personally don't find anything wrong with Jong Hyun and Seung Yeon, because their relationship seems normal for the reality of what it is (meeting a stranger and whatnot). It is awkward, but I can definitely see them warming up in the coming weeks.  Henry and Yewon are both idols so they know how to act to a variety audience, but it's too false to be believable... At least with Seung Yeon, she isn't an idol and she's quite new to acting so there's some genuine feeling between her and Jong Hyun."

koreanvariety,32cv1t,KnivesMillions,3,Sun Apr 12 22:11:11 2015 UTC,I'm not sure what any of us can do about it lol
koreanvariety,32cv1t,sportsteambfan,3,Sun Apr 12 19:17:57 2015 UTC,"Everyone is talking about low ratings but if you look at the recent ratings Roommate actually was FIRST on March 24th in it's timeslot and was gradually rising in ratings week to week. This was of course until SBS decided to pull the plug from Roommate the week after the 24th and the ratings dipped again to 3.1.   As I've been saying for weeks, Roommate's ratings actually are not that bad. They're not first but they're  not last either - more like top middle.   I think the show struggles from the fact that many of the stars have conflicts with the show. Roommate is unique in that the stars have to sleep and maybe even spend a whole couple or three days there. That's a lot of commitment and many of the stars on Roommate are top notch comedians, actors, stars, and idols.   To find other replacements would mean going through the same cycle over and over and that must be frustrating and confusing to the cast and to the fans."
koreanvariety,32cv1t,Hitokiri2,5,Mon Apr 13 03:29:43 2015 UTC,"Hi, i'm the main RM PD.  Honestly i would call him but i'm still very pissed off at them taking my show ratings down (sometimes they count both shows for one stat) and it's not like we're really that well now so i'm not going to do it. If they want to appear in TV then come to my show that i need 6 new guests for every episode."
koreanvariety,32cv1t,deoxix,3,Sun Apr 12 20:14:04 2015 UTC,"Hi, I am the Roommateu PD.  Don't blame the ratings on me, I was only copying the guesthouse idea from you and every other SBS shows.
