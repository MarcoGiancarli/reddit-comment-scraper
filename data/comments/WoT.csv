WoT,3e3wgz,Somorled,2,Tue Jul 21 20:54:14 2015 UTC,"Right. As I understood, the bell toll is the announcement that another has entered. He hears two, one for Rand and one for Moraine. are the Bell tolls and the shaking directly related?"
WoT,3e3wgz,Nygmus,2,Tue Jul 21 20:57:07 2015 UTC,It strongly seems to suggest to me that the problem causing the shaking was simply overstress on the connection between Randland and Finnland.
WoT,3e3wgz,mattronus,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:37:48 2015 UTC,Mat notes that the tower they're in in ToM is the tower he saw out the window in tSR. I think the sounds were more like alarms for the Aelfin maybe

Oh, also something I found out just a little while back on this sub: apparently the Seanchan accent is a mashup of 25% vaguely-Eastern-European and 75% Texas drawl.

WoT,3e30r9,orru,2,Tue Jul 21 16:36:39 2015 UTC,Exactly. The whole reason he didn't continue doing his normal trip and instead headed to Falme is because two ta'veren hopped onto his ship one night.

WoT,3e30r9,Nygmus,6,Tue Jul 21 18:52:31 2015 UTC,"Well, I tried to figure this out, the best I can come up with is that she needs the rocket tubes casted or something. Just throwing guesses. Mat doesn’t do any better, so he gives up for now.    ""Or something"" would be right. But you'll find out or have it spoiled for you sooner or later, no sense not to RAFO this one. Besides, like I said before, I didn't get it until it was revealed, myself.   I thought they’d left after that battle with Rand, but apparently that’s not the case.    I think the battle with Rand was farther to the north and east. If anything, their soldiers would be withdrawing to Ebou Dar, since it's one of their major bases of operations and landing points.   I wonder how many of these came of their own volition. I mean, most farmers/traders/whatever would prefer to stick to their lands rather come to a foreign country, unless the living conditions back in Seanchan really suck.   You'd be surprised. It's pioneering, is what it is; land and titles are gonna get handed out like party favors out here. Easy for some dirt-farmer to wind up with a parcel of land that makes where he lived back home look like a postage stamp.  We had no shortage of people willing to saddle up and brave the journey West during the gold rush/wagon trail era, after all.   Mat’s savior turns out to be an old man called Noal Charim, and a grateful Mat invites him to the palace because the fellow doesn’t have a place to sleep.   Hi again, Noal! Good to see you. (And thus we continue Mat's tradition of tripping over plot points while looking for ways to avoid them.)   Oh, and for some reason thinking of Rand or Perrin produces “odd swirls of color” in Mat’s head. Hmm, could this be connected to what Rand sometimes feels – where he almost sees a face that’s not there.   I'm so grumbly about this, still. I asked RJ about this directly at a signing and he gave me a RAFO.    But then a Seanchan officer barges into the kitchen, and Mat has to resort to the classic kiss-to-hide trick to obscure Joline’s ageless face.    This scene always makes me laugh. As classic Mat as it gets.   And though Mat realises he doesn’t actually owe her anything:   Yeah... this is one of the reasons I do really like Mat. He won't admit it but dude's got an honorable streak a mile wide under all that boyish charm.   Also, it kind of blows my mind that Bayle, a character that I dismissed immediately as some random guy on whose boat Rand and Mat jumped in  EoTW, has been popping up in so many places and you kind of get this feel of his whole personal plot going on that occasionally intersects the big one.   Bayle Domon is kind of a bro, like that. I think this kind of feel is one of the things that makes WoT feel larger than life.   He recognised Mat in the kitchen. Hmm, it seems Mat’s going to smuggle out quite a number of people.   I can just see it now. ""Do you bloody expect me to sneak out with half the city? Burn me, next you'll be expecting me to take the gholam with me.""  That's a complete fabrication, but I'm sure he's probably feeling a bit frustrated, too."
WoT,3e30r9,random-human,5,Tue Jul 21 22:05:57 2015 UTC,"Back in the city, they find it crowded with Seanchan settlers. I wonder how many of these came of their own volition. I mean, most farmers/traders/whatever would prefer to stick to their lands rather come to a foreign country, unless the living conditions back in Seanchan really suck.   Probably because their Returning has been so glorified in their culture? The Seanchan seem like people who believe in that a little too rigidly.   the fact that they have slavery   Plus, they treat damane as literal dogs, with naming, petting, offering sweets, and even daily walks...   [Mat] finds [Tylin] in a meeting, with Suroth, and more importantly, Tuon   I found the High Ladies' behavior a little odd here - all other times, as far as I can remember, commoners were required to kneel with face down in front of them to show respect, with failure to do so apparently punished, but here they tolerate Mat's casual mannerisms. Also, no Deathwatch Guards at the entrance of the room?   We also saw this seeker at the time [Tanchico].

In more than one way She gets a few of the most bad-ass scenes, and a lot of those are related to that LoC spoiler.  He goes missing from the story for one entire book. But once he's back he becomes even more Mat. More insight into their workings is inbound. Lot's of more insight. He's like the threat you see from the corner of your eyes when walking through a dark alley. You're almost sure it's not there, but what if it is.   What i mean is that some parts of the series might not be your favourite literature ever. But every single bit of near-purple prose is worth reading. Even the descriptions of dresses at one point turn out to be relevant.   If you can somehow convince yourself to keep going, please do. LoC has pretty much the best ending in the series, so surely finish that and than imagine that the last battle is longer than some novels and possibly even more hectic."

There are several hinting factors that Randland is earth (and is even called Earth by one of the forsaken at one point). Taking this into account as well as the various information we know about the breaking (Land became ocean, plains became mountains) i think its outright impossible that the Seanchan Ogier were able to stay on their steadings while the Westerland Ogier weren't as lucky.  That being said, it MAY have been mentioned they did and i just missed it but without knowing it, i find it highly imporbable. More likely is the fact Seanchan has different Angreal than the westerlands in general and it wouldn't surprise me if they had one which could help Ogier against the longing. OR simply that seanchan is hardcore as fuck and their ogier as like ""Longing, FUCK that i serve the empress may she live forever""  EDIT: Did some research and it turns out Ogier in Seanchan technically don't suffer from the longing, but thats because there's a shit-ton of steadings. This over-abundance of steadings makes it so the longing takes much, much longer to kick in."

I honestly think that the whole ""rape of Mat"" is a bit harsh. The entire world Robert Jordan created is female centric. Women like Tylin do that because it is the 'norm' in Ebou Dar. Remember this is a culture where you present a knife to the woman you are going to marry so she can stab you with it if you displease her.  I didn't like Tuon at this part of the story.

WoT,3duhjz,ReculifNatas,3,Mon Jul 20 02:09:37 2015 UTC,I really liked the bit where Mat made an extremely complicated plan to sneak into a village and Talmanes and the others just refused to take it seriously.... then minor spoiler book 11 or so
WoT,3duhjz,H4rg,2,Mon Jul 20 08:31:37 2015 UTC,"there is a lot of hilarious moment, but i think my favorite are  -book 13 : Rand trolls Cadsuane when they go visite the borderland army : ""you can call me Rand Sedai"" -book 13 also : Verin explain to Mat how she got dragged to him by his tavereness  i also liked a lot Aiel humor in general!"
