asianpeoplegifs,3blng1,usedtoilet,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:19:52 2015 UTC,I couldn't agree more :)
asianpeoplegifs,3blng1,DragonscaleDiscoball,1 point,Fri Jul 10 05:42:44 2015 UTC,"I definitely see what you're saying, but I fear it also scares off the community you would want. Like, if you have an apartment building with graffiti on the walls and tenants who miss their rent payments. You can't refuse to clean the graffiti until tenants stop being late on rent. You have to keep the building clean first to attract the tenants you want."
asianpeoplegifs,3blng1,_ChoiSooyoung,1 point,Fri Jul 10 12:25:33 2015 UTC,"I'm honestly not seeing any scaring off and I personally don't have any particular community I want - I just want people to post gifs that they enjoy that are centered around asian people. If the majority is happy, then I'm happy.  The real issue this sub faces is total content, not one specific type of content. I feel the best thing that can be done (if you feel that the content is not to your liking) is to fill the sub with what you would like to see! If that is what others in the community feel they want those kinds of posts as well, they'll follow suit and we could have a more active sub again. I challenge anyone that is unhappy with the type of recent submissions to be the one to take action and change the sub through submission.  Edit: I'm going to take my own advice and try and post up a couple different gifs and see what type of content the community prefers. Please do the same!"
asianpeoplegifs,3blng1,Utrolig,9,Fri Jul 10 13:58:02 2015 UTC,I don't think there are enough posts in this subreddit to justify restrictions like you mentioned.
asianpeoplegifs,3blng1,bwicesoldier,7,Tue Jun 30 11:21:40 2015 UTC,"I've had this feeling for a while, but I assumed it was pointless to actually say it because I really really doubt it would be the consensus. So I'm glad you did.   Yeah, there are a lot of Asians here, but I have another feeling that the plurality of people here, as on all of reddit, are the typical teenage to early-20s white male.   That, of course, is not a problem. But partly because of this, there is some kind of fetishisation going on. Which ultimately is contributing to the content of this subreddit from what should mostly be novel/quirky ""Asian"" gifs to mostly gifs of cute Asian girls being cute. Seriously though, the 'essence' of /r/whitepeoplegifs is like... bad dancing or whatever, not cute white girls being cute. I'd hate for the 'essence' of /r/asianpeoplegifs to be cute Asian girls being cute. I would rather see more posts like this, this, this, etc.  So really I agree with the sentiment behind what you suggest, but like others said, there isn't really enough content to just ban things. Even the examples I gave are relatively recent from the front page, so it's not like that kind of content downright disappeared. I wish it didn't get to that point in the first place (we're there all right). I wish the audience would all of a sudden change their mind as to what they like, but that isn't going to happen. I wish they would all go to and keep it to the two subreddits you suggested or others like it. I wish the accepted 'rule' wasn't just ""Asian people -- check"", but there just isn't enough content or consensus, which is unfortunate on both fronts.  Yeah, I liked the sub better before too. I just don't care for cute Asian girls doing mundane things here, because while there are plenty of resources gathered elsewhere for that, there isn't much for the original 'essence' of r/asianpeoplegifs.  Oh, to actually straightforwardly answer your question in the title: YES. There should be. But there isn't going to be. Only the minority would agree to it, and the mods/creator probably would not."
asianpeoplegifs,3blng1,MrBadNews,7,Tue Jun 30 19:40:01 2015 UTC,"This, basically. I come to /r/asianpeoplegifs for absurdity, not cute things."
asianpeoplegifs,3blng1,appropriate-username,11,Tue Jun 30 22:53:45 2015 UTC,"History has shown that banning certain content doesn't create new content. The 'good' content we appreciate most in this sub isn't being drowned in cheaper or easier submissions, it's just hard to come by in general. I think we would best be served finding ways to increase the number of subscriptions and submissions in order to have more content to be picky about."

asianpeoplegifs,351lxt,autowikibot,2,Wed May 6 17:13:07 2015 UTC,"Paternoster:       A paternoster (/ˈpeɪtərˈnɒstər/, /ˈpɑː-/, or /ˈpæ-/) or paternoster lift is a passenger elevator which consists of a chain of open compartments (each usually designed for two persons) that move slowly in a loop up and down inside a building without stopping. Passengers can step on or off at any floor they like. The same technique is also used for filing cabinets to store great amounts of (paper) documents or for small spare parts.  As a result of safety issues, many such lifts have been shut down. However, a few survive around the world. The largest of these is located in the Arts Tower at the University of Sheffield, which also remains the tallest university-owned building in the UK. Another one can be found at the IG Farben building In Frankfurt am Main. The much smaller Belt manlift which consists of an endless belt with steps and rungs but no compartments is also sometimes called a Paternoster.

I know they can take years and YEARS of use.   I still hold my breath every time I'm in one.  I used to take an elevator every day (just up 4 floors though. Because lazy.) at work, when, one day, there was a fire underground which took the power down. This happened not 20 minutes after I had stepped off the elevator. So, power goes out, and I hear the alarm bell in all 3 elevators ringing. I'm pretty sure I would've shit myself had I been one of those poor souls that got stuck.   30 minutes later, fire department shows up and gets them out and all is well. But still...

A rather funny sight.  The otherwise gracious and titillating moves on the dancefloor becomes nothing but a herky-jerk series of random flailing, akin to an epilepsy seizure.   This strange behaviour is due to the brain being only the size of a walnut, like with the Stegosaurus. As well as the lack of colorful lights and alcohol in the male body.   This all makes you wonder doesnt it? Perhaps we can all take a lesson from these four miscreants, and learn some fucking moves"

asianpeoplegifs,2uyim4,gerrettheferrett,5,Fri Feb 6 05:56:26 2015 UTC,"I saw it on a gameshow a while back. Public apologies on one's knees (dogeza: literally ""ground"" ""below/inferior"" ""squat"", in Japanese) is the ultimate form of apologizing. The amount you bow to someone is how much you are deferent to them, so touching your knees and head to the ground is the most you can bow.  It is not considered socially ""cool"" to dogeza, but some situations of apology demand it. IIRC, this game show was showing exaggerated examples, for comedic effect, of how a man can remain ""cool"" and handsome while doing dogeza in front of a woman."

asianpeoplegifs,2msyms,lovebikeclimb,-7,Thu Nov 20 03:59:36 2014 UTC,What part of this GIF has to do with asian people?
asianpeoplegifs,2msyms,torres240,12,Thu Nov 20 06:29:13 2014 UTC,The boy is asian
asianpeoplegifs,2msyms,TheGreezyOne,1 point,Thu Nov 20 08:25:38 2014 UTC,Is he really? I always assumed that he has Iberian/Native South American ancestry.
asianpeoplegifs,2msyms,Quetzie,2,Tue Nov 25 02:32:11 2014 UTC,Iberian/Native South American ancestry   That's quite the combo . . .  Also here's the video of the dance. Asian features seem pretty clear to me.
asianpeoplegifs,2msyms,smileyman,1 point,Tue Nov 25 18:20:47 2014 UTC,"Not really, since almost all people living in South America are of Iberian descent, with some native mixed in.   The kid in the video looks more like a Mayan or an Aztec than an Asian."
asianpeoplegifs,2msyms,Quetzie,2,Tue Nov 25 23:11:50 2014 UTC,"just let it slide man, it'll be alright"
asianpeoplegifs,2msyms,savedbythehell,1 point,Fri Feb 6 20:30:13 2015 UTC,"I let it slide about 2 months ago, dude."
asianpeoplegifs,2msyms,Quetzie,3,Fri Feb 6 20:58:40 2015 UTC,"So by now it's been three months, but this gif on this sub has actually been bothering me for quite a while now because the boy didn't look Asian to me at all. So I finally got down to some fact-digging and EDIT: basically came across a family photograph which isn't very conclusive.  I'd actually love to get /u/TheGreezyOne and /u/smileyman and hear their opinions on this because I think this actually touches on a longstanding theme of quality control and accuracy on this subreddit, as well as what it truly means to be Asian."
asianpeoplegifs,2msyms,Mykeliu,2,Fri Mar 20 07:35:51 2015 UTC,"Well two things.  You don't have to look Asian to be Asian. If you limit your definition of being Asian to how a person looks, might be close to going down the path of racial profiling. Which is one of the dangerous things of this sub in my opinion. I hope it doesn't slowly paint an image into people's heads on what an Asian should look like because there's many types of Asian and many ways to define it (culturally, regionally, ethnically, linguistically).  A surname is not all that reliable. Take for instance in the Philippines where surnames were uncommon until the Spanish colonization; many Filipinos have Spanish surnames without a hint of Spanish blood in them. The Spanish wanted to give surnames to more easily keep track of citizens, and often times families were given a list of names to pick from (edit: This is why there are many Filipinos that share a last name that aren't at all related. Like Santos, Visaya, De La Cruz, and Cortez). I'm full Filipino and my surname is actually Hebrew.  I feel uncomfortable bringing this boy and his family into it so I'd prefer not to use anymore pictures or names"
asianpeoplegifs,2msyms,TheGreezyOne,2,Fri Mar 20 18:38:42 2015 UTC,"I wholeheartedly agree with you on the points of appearance and the family's privacy, and I'm editing the comment to minimize the family's presence.  I think the whole surname was definitely the weakest point. My parents have told me stories about Western colonization of their home country, and history classes have done their fair share of elaborating on Western influences on the entire Asian continent.  And absolutely yes, I think anyone who embodies, embraces, or even appreciates Asian culture can be considered Asian to a degree. And clearly ""Asia"" is a broad region, yet ""looking Asian"" has developed to become more narrow. I think this sub has its focus on ethnically Asian people, typically from China/Taiwan, Japan, and Korea. I'd actually love a broader sub, like maybe a /r/asianculturegifs, but I'm not sure how that would turn out.  But even with all that said, I'm hoping that maybe we can agree that this gif doesn't particularly highlight any aspect of Asian culture—though I can't say for certain that their dance moves didn't originate from any part of our continent—which was the point that ultimately led to me spending more time thinking and researching than I've ever spent on a high school essay."

Why is it that the proliferation of the internet has lead to such terrible stuff getting popular, I thought it was meant to be good?"
asianpeoplegifs,2jmf8z,PotentialConfidentia,6,Sun Oct 19 03:23:58 2014 UTC,"She's an actress, writer and filmmaker hence the quality of her editing. She has done some short films like Riley Rewind, Here she is and Afflicted, she also appeared on the foster on AbC , Awkward on mtv and shake it up from Disney. Obviously she isn't famous, nor her shorts are any masterpiece work but as opposed to what everyone else may believe you don't necessarily have to be famous to make a living in this industry. Apparently  she's really into what she does so yeah no my cup of tea but she surely isn't terrible."

Also HQ cameras and easy to use editing software are more widespread than ever, hence the greater amount of these vlogs.

asianpeoplegifs,2crd3m,Taknallurmoney,9,Wed Aug 6 21:48:11 2014 UTC,"You may have thought your plea for sauce went unheard...fear not!  I stumbled onto this thread by chance, and I am duty bound to fulfill all requests for a source.  After a bit of reverse image search finagling and some reading (including FunnyJunk comments...these are the sacrifices I must make), I managed to determine that this was from a Brazzers video.  From there, I simply looked at the list of Asian performers, easily picked out the woman from the GIF (Marica Hase), and then picked the correct video out of the only two available: Lost in Squirtation.  Now, if you happen to have a Brazzers account, I guess that link is all you need.  If you're like the rest of us freeloaders...sadly, I'm having a bear of a time locating a good torrent, direct download, or stream.  The best stream I've got for you is this abridged clip from Brazzers' official Pornhub channel.  I have also uploaded the 480p/1000kbps full version I found on TPB (did anyone seed the HD versions?  Of couuuuurse not.).  If I manage to get my hands on a higher quality version, I'll upload it and update this comment (and even shoot you a PM, if you'd like).  As a sidebar: damn, the dude in this video has top-percentage helicopter dick skills.  I'm jealous.  And I kinda wish they had sprinkled more of that HUD gimmick throughout the video, for both the communication and POV aspects of it.    EDIT: Well, one of those seedless torrents had a hidden seeder!  It's now up in 720p (same link).  Wouldn't hold out hope for the 1080p, though...everyone's stuck at 16.6%."

asianpeoplegifs,21rdln,nelson2k,5,Mon Mar 31 00:09:29 2014 UTC,"China Girl (song):       ""China Girl"" is a song co-written by David Bowie and Iggy Pop during their years in Berlin, first appearing on Pop's album The Idiot (1977).  It became more widely known when it was rerecorded and released by Bowie on his album Let's Dance (1983). Paul Trynka, the author of David Bowie's biography, Starman, claims the song was inspired by Iggy Pop's infatuation with Kuelan Nguyen, a beautiful Vietnamese woman.   The UK single release reached No. 2 for one week on 14 June 1983, behind ""Every Breath You Take"" by The Police. The US release reached No. 10.

Same reason why stereotypical asian parents push their kids to be doctors and lawyers, those positions are prestigious and are skill based rather than relying on politicking so they are relatively immune to racism. In Japan's case, classical western music are promoted by a violinist hoping to heal post WW2 Japan through teaching kids to play classical instruments: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suzuki_method  I've heard a testimony of a elderly koto player that she was pressured to switch to piano as piano was more accepted world wide. If in an alternate universe, the East was the dominant military power, you probably would see throngs of Europeans performing eastern music."

The central belief of Suzuki, based on his language acquisition theories, is that all people are capable of learning from their environment. The essential components of his method spring from the desire to create the ""right environment"" for learning music. He also believed that this positive environment would also help to foster character in students.

asianpeoplegifs,1ut5gk,BrodoFaggins,1 point,Thu Jan 9 21:42:22 2014 UTC,I remembered that name Ikebukuro from Japan. I think it was a train stop in Tokio. So I looked up what the full name was. Ikebukuro Uesuto Gēto Pāku. Did they really just transliterate the English words?
asianpeoplegifs,1ut5gk,returnofthecityboy,5,Thu Jan 9 21:51:45 2014 UTC,Not sure if serious.....  Ikebukuro is a large station and major transfer point in North west Tokyo.   Foreign loan words wholly or partially transliterated into Katakana is not at all unusual.
asianpeoplegifs,1ut5gk,ITSigno,1 point,Fri Jan 10 02:46:04 2014 UTC,"I find it mich more surprising because these are all normal words that I think have a Japanese version. And also the Japanese seem to be so isolated and homogeneous. English has all these loan words from colonization, trade and immigration."
asianpeoplegifs,1ut5gk,returnofthecityboy,-1,Fri Jan 10 10:06:28 2014 UTC,"Japan has colonized, was essentially colonized by America after the war in many ways, engages in trade and has immigration both ways. In some ways the country can be described as ""isolated and homogeneous"" but on the other hand they advanced so far beyond surrounding Asian countries during the industrial revolution because of their unique approach toward adopting western technology and ideas, although they put their own unique spin on them."
asianpeoplegifs,1ut5gk,ITSigno,4,Fri Jan 10 10:55:09 2014 UTC,"Japan's practice of adopting foreign words predates the occupation by quite a bit. In fact, there was a bit of a backlash against the practice before/during world war 2. This is the reason, for example, that 野球（やきゅう） is used for baseball instead of a katakana word.   The Meiji constitution was also heavily influenced by the German constitution of the time. Also, a lot of words in the medical field at the time were imported from German (and continued to be so for decades afterwards).   I'd also be somewhat reluctant to suggest that Japan's relatively quick advancement was entirely due to open adoption and adaptation of western ideas and technology. It didn't really help that China suffered under the opium wars, then Japanese occupation, then the cultural revolution. Japan was certainly bloodied by the end of world war 2, but China, Korea and other neighbours had been far more devastated."
asianpeoplegifs,1ut5gk,ITSigno,0,Fri Jan 10 12:27:08 2014 UTC,"I understand that it predates the occupation, I meant to convey that by noting that Japan looked to the west during the late 19th century. (I used the term industrial revolution but I guess that had technically passed in the West but I still feel it describes what happened during and around the Meji restoration fairly well.)   I didn't mean to say suggest that Japan got all it's loan words, or even most of them, from America, just to explain why so many English words might show up. I mean Japan has a number of Dutch loan words because of their historical relationship and the concept of rangaku.  On the topic of Japan's advancement, my original comment was reductive so thanks for the clarification. Mind you I was trying to refer mainly the the 19th century and the early 20th century. You mention the opium was and it's true that one advantage Japan enjoyed was the ability to watch China's relationship with the Western nations develop and learn from their experience. China and Japan's initial reaction to Western intrusion was pretty similar, but Japan was quicker to give in and play along, partly because of . And you're right, no country tried to force something like opium on Japan so that goes a long ways toward engendering what good will did exist.   So you raise an extremely important point, which is that Japan's attitudes and actions cannot be viewed in a vacuum and they enjoyed a number of advantages simply because of their luck. While Japan had their share of troubles during the period they enjoyed a higher level of national unity and avoided the rule of anyone who was absolutely opposed to reform like Empress Cixi. I didn't want to imply that there was anything necessarily superior about Japan or their natural character, my belief is that in many ways they were at the right place at the right time and I think history has always been kind to such people. Now that Korea and China's economies look more vibrant than Japan's we can wonder how things might have been different if everyone involved took different approaches during the first meetings between the Eastern powers and the Western imperialists."

How fucking classy.  EDIT: I meant the comments below. They're not visible now, unless you hit expand."
asianpeoplegifs,1tv81z,kupakuma,17,Sat Dec 28 11:31:09 2013 UTC,Why don't you reply to the comment next time so that we know what you're talking about?
asianpeoplegifs,1tv81z,PunchDrunkBitches,29,Sat Dec 28 20:31:54 2013 UTC,"It's perfectly reasonable to be attracted to a girl from an ethnicity you find interesting or that you think will make you experience new things. I don't think it's a checklist per se, because if someone would date an Asian and love her/him, they may get married and there isn't anything wrong with that. A lot of people are attracted to what they feel is uncommon or unknown to them, so it makes sense as Asians are less common than Caucasians of African Americans in most areas, and it's natural to be curious."
asianpeoplegifs,1tv81z,OhMrBigshot,17,Sat Dec 28 12:37:32 2013 UTC,"I think both of you are correct. I think what's bothersome, however, is the clear objectification of people (women) -- particularly in the two comments below. The way those two commenters phrased their sentences implies that Asian girls are assets, something that you can own and keep and work towards (if you're rich, etc.). This type of behavior is unhealthy.  It is perfectly reasonable to have preferences or attraction. Though, I think that people with yellow fever could phrase their attraction in a more neutral way (and, in turn, actually be able to attract those types of girls):   Wow, there's something about Asian girls that's so inexplicably beautiful - maybe it's the way they speak or act or just how they carry themselves. I would love an opportunity to get to know one."

Lack of qualitative discussion, and instead issuing a drive-by downvote and a parent comment chiding it elsewhere, removes the ability to have those talks, and condemns them to a few, judging eyes.  You have to unfold pretty far down to get to my point, but how many people will do that?"

asianpeoplegifs,1tv81z,Machinax,6,Sat Dec 28 16:17:29 2013 UTC,"To be honest, I think it WAS pretty shitty using a term like ""one"" to describe a person. It objectifies the woman, and it's not a nice thing to say. Your comment didn't come off like a joke, but I can understand that maybe you were trying to be humorous. I'll give you the benefit of the doubt and say you had good intentions, but seriously, treat people like people. It's not okay to say you ""got one"" like she's a new fucking iPod.  This is coming from a white male, if that's important to you."
asianpeoplegifs,1tv81z,AshNazg,-6,Sun Dec 29 06:32:20 2013 UTC,"Ok. Understandably I could have used different terminology to get my point across.  But ""got one"" could be used in multiple ways to not show iPod like ownership? I didn't even think about it like that.  Imagine your buddy gets married and one time during extreme elevation hey says.."" I did it, I got one"" because he just got married.  But oh no, here comes the person in the room who is ""racist"" and can't laugh at the joke because it's politically incorrect due to the offense of woman being compared to objects.. Etc etc  You have to learn how to laugh at yourself and at others, but in a good hearted way without ill intentions.  Laugh with them, not at them.  Lighting up buddy"

Whilst 현 is pronounce h-yeo-n, because of the initial ""ㅎ"" giving it the soft ""h"" sound, & ""ㅕ"" with the ""yeo"" sound which doesn't protrudes your lips so much, kinda like how you would pronounce the word ""young""."

They seemed to think it was a legitimate ""fuck you"" to the Nazis, not only the old ones but also as a ""you're heroes means nothing to us"" to the new neo-Nazis.

asianpeoplegifs,1qv0xf,play150,6,Wed Nov 20 22:51:12 2013 UTC,"It probably says ""I thought I'd go open the door.""  I say 'probably' because the character that should say 'open' isn't actually the character for 'open'. My guess is the font tried to simplify part of the character since it looks similar, but I'm not really sure, so 'open' could be replaced by some other verb."

asianpeoplegifs,1qhs7t,BobRossNTV,5,Wed Nov 13 05:58:20 2013 UTC,Thank you! No one ever knows about the 2 different ju-on versions. Takes forever to explain it all whenever I try to bring it up.
asianpeoplegifs,1qhs7t,otaku-o_o,2,Wed Nov 13 08:02:01 2013 UTC,Yeah. The first one was an absolute masterpiece and perfectly creepy in all the right ways. It was also low production as hell.
asianpeoplegifs,1qhs7t,BobRossNTV,2,Wed Nov 13 14:19:04 2013 UTC,I watched The Grudge first. Scared the crap out of me. Then I tried watching the Asian version and wasn't scared at all. Weird eh?
asianpeoplegifs,1qhs7t,unclairvoyance,3,Wed Nov 13 19:15:56 2013 UTC,I think he's talking about Ju-on: The Curse vs. Ju-on: The Grudge
asianpeoplegifs,1qhs7t,BobRossNTV,1 point,Wed Nov 13 20:55:08 2013 UTC,"Are you sure it was the original Ju-on?  Additionally, it wasn't so much scary, but horror movies tend to not scare me. It's that the subtle elements of it made it good."
asianpeoplegifs,1qhs7t,BobRossNTV,1 point,Wed Nov 13 22:30:39 2013 UTC,"I'm pretty sure. Same thing when I watched The Eye then I watched the Asian version. Also, I watched Battle Royale when it first came out and liked it. But when I watched The Hunger Games, I thought it was ""ok""... I guess once I know the storyline, it kind of ruins it for me. Though, there are times when it's kind of reverse. Like I really enjoyed the latest Dredd but didn't care much for Judge Dredd back in the 90's."

asianpeoplegifs,1przbg,GodzillaFiresox,8,Sun Nov 3 02:18:39 2013 UTC,edit: I AM NOT A FEMINST PLEASE STOP SENDING ME ANGRY PMS  Getting hit in the boobs can hurt pretty bad.
asianpeoplegifs,1przbg,bwukki,17,Sun Nov 3 04:59:43 2013 UTC,"but not quite as bad   you have never been hit in the testicles. Unless getting hit in the boob gives you a shooting pain in your torso for anywhere between 5 and 60 minutes, they can't be compared."
asianpeoplegifs,1przbg,OceanCarlisle,3,Sun Nov 3 05:45:59 2013 UTC,I think they meant getting hit in boobs isn't as painful as in the balls. Though I don't know how there were able to know what both of those feel like.
asianpeoplegifs,1przbg,coldtoasty,1 point,Sun Nov 3 06:21:07 2013 UTC,Maybe if you got your fat ass off the computer once in awhile you would realize getting hit in the balls doesn't hurt that bad.    LOL.. perhaps you need to have your balls examined by medical professional.
asianpeoplegifs,1przbg,ThatCrankyGuy,-2,Sun Nov 3 06:26:35 2013 UTC,"My point is that you can't compare the two. And still, didn't hurt as much you sure you've been hit in the nuts?

The driver stopped the car right on my foot before I started smacking the bed as loud as I could for him to realize what happened. Then he drove off my foot. It was nothing but a weird pressure sensation. It didn't hurt at all but was uncomfortable. I could walk as though it didn't happen immediately after.

asianpeoplegifs,1mumws,germinik,1 point,Sun Sep 22 02:30:41 2013 UTC,Yes. I'm currently in the middle of a move between houses and have managed to cram too much into my iPhone for me to update to iOS 7 or update any of my apps. Most of it is music I've downloaded and I can't delete any of it until I have my computer back to backup the music onto. Would this link work on the new AB?
asianpeoplegifs,1mumws,Antrikshy,1 point,Sun Sep 22 02:35:49 2013 UTC,"Indeed it should. I've had no trouble at all with the current version so far. Note that you DO NOT have to have iOS 7 for the latest version of AB to work. A feature or two may not function such as push notifications for comment replies until you update tho. As always, it's beautiful and worth every penny.  Definitely browse through /r/iPhone before you update to familiarize yourself with some of the changes. Everything is waaay different now.  I can't say that I am pleased with the update. It's kind of like when iTunes and Facebook revamp their look and you feel completely lost for a while.  And on the off chance that you or a friend own an iPad 3, people are reporting performance problems and regret updating."

My brother had it because of his nose bridge was messed up, my mom at double eye lid surgery thing because her eyelashes were growing inwards. I'm supposed to get it too, but I look horrendous with it so I just go to the doctor to have it temporarily fixed occasionally.  But appearance is absolutely crucial in Korean society. When such a small nation has a gigantic population, every aspect of a person is important. A person could be the smartest person in the nation with an amazing personality, but the first impression of the person's face could be ""meh"", and could be denied a job.  There are Koreans that look great naturally, but statistically speaking I think Chinese/Taiwanese (at least, the ladies) look better. I'm Korean, so this is in no way biased."

asianpeoplegifs,1j1eo9,AnotherClosetAtheist,14,Thu Jul 25 17:17:43 2013 UTC,"If you want a serious answer: because the offensiveness of a term comes from the connotations, and not from the actual meaning of the words. The words ""black"", ""negro"", and the other n-word all mean the same thing: they all mean ""black"". But one is often acceptable in casual conversation, one is associated with 60s-style segregation, and on is generally considered quite offensive.  Similarly, while ""black"" and ""white"" are considered okay as broad casual descriptions of ethnicity, ""yellow"" is associated with racism, even though using a colour in itself is not any more offensive."

asianpeoplegifs,1hygcs,TheHopefulPresident,5,Tue Jul 9 20:29:57 2013 UTC,She got it in the right direction and just outside of the area the batter stands in. That's pretty accurate

asianpeoplegifs,1hygcs,DTMaster,-20,Wed Jul 17 07:52:08 2013 UTC,"By 'amazing' do you mean that the catcher had to stand up and step to the side because she missed the plate by a country mile?  Then yes, it is amazing.    Let's get serious, this is popular because it's a female and it would be 10 times as popular if she was nude."
asianpeoplegifs,1hygcs,Lunch3Box,9,Wed Jul 17 16:21:06 2013 UTC,"It is amazing that she still threw better than most people who throw out the first pitch. cough Jessica cough  BTW, you saw that ass right? I'm just making sure"
asianpeoplegifs,1hygcs,rafkong,-7,Wed Jul 10 01:41:36 2013 UTC,"lol, agree with you there.  Throwing out the first pitch is usually an excersie in embarassment.  I think most people don't even realize how far it is to home plate.  Yes, she did better than most, but then again did she do so well as to call it 'Amazing'?  Certainly not, except as a novelty.  Yes, her ass is nice, but I mentioned that in my original post.  If I wanted to see a pretty asian girl's butt, I could do so without watching a long wind up.

He calls a girl with a bunch of guys in the nearby a booth a bitch and then leaves Li to clean up the mess. Li stops short of hitting the girl who dares him to strike a woman.

He did act as the guy Jack Nicholson's character was based off of but this wasn't from Infernal affairs.

asianpeoplegifs,1b229p,batia0121,2,Sat May 18 19:09:01 2013 UTC,I feel like the camera crops/zooms are cheating somehow...
asianpeoplegifs,1b229p,LiterallyKesha,1 point,Wed Mar 27 01:04:07 2013 UTC,"When you change the focus/FOA, it naturally does this. I doubt there was any real cropping, but just the camera's natural expanding and tightening aperture changed the frame so it looks like it's being cropped.  An example of this in film is called zollying, where the camera zooms in or out as it moves in the opposite direction.  Here's a video for reference."
asianpeoplegifs,1b229p,SantaTouchedMe,1 point,Wed Mar 27 07:24:06 2013 UTC,"In the OPs gif the camera is not moving backwards as the lens is zooming, that's what is happening in your video. In the OPs video the frame is being moved so that the tip of the finger is always in center, then the video is cropped so you don't see the edges of frame moving around. Also the exposure is the same with the same amount of light, so it's not he aperture changing size which I don't think changes fov either way."

asianpeoplegifs,19ul6k,voxpupil,3,Mon Mar 11 06:13:41 2013 UTC,"Here's a composite I hacked together from several wikipedia articles.   Yuuko Oushima is a member of the Japanese idol group AKB48, a girl group of 88 pop music idols ranging in age from 13 to mid-20s. The idea of AKB48's producer Yasushi Akimoto was to create a girl group that, unlike a regular pop group which gives occasional concerts and that is mostly seen on TV, would have its own theater and perform there on a daily basis; the fans would always be able to go and see the girls live. AKB48 still performs at the theater every day; tickets are now distributed only via a lottery.  The group consists of four subgroups: Team A, Team K, Team B, and Team 4. Having several teams not only allows the group to reduce the load on its members, since a daily concert at the theater is given by only one team, but also gives AKB48 opportunity to perform in several places and even countries simultaneously. Yuuko is Captain of Team K.   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AKB48  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuko_Oshima"

Too much pride to do that. So Hughes just got the TKO with punches instead.

asianpeoplegifs,18x1qy,Thedrass,11,Thu Feb 21 03:44:33 2013 UTC,"Don't forget the kanji! 凄い  Though it is appropriate to write it in katakana as well. Used for emphatic purposes (similar to italics, I guess)"
asianpeoplegifs,18x1qy,LokitAK,2,Thu Feb 21 05:01:15 2013 UTC,cause I am woefully lame with Hiragana at the moment
asianpeoplegifs,18x1qy,Dr-Venture,1 point,Thu Feb 21 05:52:26 2013 UTC,Katakana is flexible based from some of the manga I've read in Japanese. Sometimes some basic word is spelled in katakana just so you wouldn't be confused with the words that is similar in one sentence.
asianpeoplegifs,18x1qy,RainbowsAreFantastic,5,Thu Feb 21 16:14:47 2013 UTC,"Katakana is mainly used for foreign words, and onomatopoeias. Hiragana is for grammatical terms, and kanji is for everything else."
