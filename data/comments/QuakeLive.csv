QuakeLive,3dlqgo,Qzkx,28,Fri Jul 17 08:05:07 2015 UTC,"Here are some reasons:   Different weapons are better in certain maps. E.g. On small maps with lots of choke points, RL is better than LG. This creates a major imbalance where some players are heavily dis-advantaged based on what weapon they spawn with.  The amount of LG ammo you start with (50 ~ 300 dmg) is not as effective to get a kill as the number of rockets (5 ~ 500 dmg potential). Considering that 300 dmg with LG is if you hit 100 percent, it's even worse when you take a realistic 33 percent accuracy, you only do 100 dmg with LG off the spawn.  The maps were designed with weapon placement in mind. For instance on almost lost / furious heights / the edge / campgrounds etc, rail is in a bad position, it should be dangerous to get a rail on those maps. With loadouts this map design aspect is irrelevant. The strategy of doing damage on weapon and ammo crate positions is removed. Without the need for fresh spawn players to grab powerful weapons, it's no longer effective to show up and do damage at these weapon locations. Working hard to win a fight that leaves you relatively low, and then immediately dying because someone spawns right in front of you with RL or LG is extremely annoying. The LG area on almost lost is a prime example, I couldn't count the number of times I've died because someone spawned near the mega ledge right after I've had a fight, or when I'm trying to jump to mega. There's no penalty to dying. In classic FFA, the player who wins is usually the one with the lowest number of deaths, because dying meant you had to waste time after spawning to find a good weapon. If you were a good player who could stay alive, you had good weapons, which gave you a better chance at getting frags. Loadouts make staying alive un-necessary, sometimes even a downside as you would rather die after each fight and respawn with fuil ammo.   In summary, loadouts took out the challenge in QL to learning a map, the weapon locations, how to survive for longer and take efficient fights.  There are a lot of good things that came out of the changes they've made to quake live, so I'm not in the 'I hate change' camp, but loadouts was not a good thing."
QuakeLive,3dlqgo,noc_ql,2,Fri Jul 17 11:45:38 2015 UTC,"The maps were designed with weapon placement in mind. For instance on almost lost / furious heights / the edge / campgrounds etc, rail is in a bad position, it should be dangerous to get a rail on those maps. With loadouts this map design aspect is irrelevant.   Plus they changed the RL in the RA room to that stupid HMG on Furious Heights.  Not to mention half the fun in ffa was sneaking around to find weapons/armor after you died, and the thrill of scoring a good weapon.  IMO they should have just added something like Rocket Arena ffa/tdm/ctf to solve the issue."

That sounds like the players fault for not selecting an appropriate loadout for the given map. Your second point could be remedied by tweaking the amount of ammo given at spawn. The rest of your points are really good and highlight my biggest issues with the new system."
QuakeLive,3dlqgo,BabyPuncher5000,-1,Fri Jul 17 19:44:09 2015 UTC,"all valid , well thought out points which I appreciate but to me FFA is pure chaos. So I am probably missing some nuance, but I do not consider FFA to be a competitive mode, to me it is very much ""Burning off steam.""  I feel like one weapon loadouts on large pop maps was ok due to dying multiple times without action and with a weapon it gave players a chance to do a thing.  The damage output balancing was for sure way off base.  overall I just think FFA is a super mega casual mode, due to the sheer chaos, that people should give less fucks about so what does it matter.  edit: i still believe that maps were designed with duel in mind but my history may be way off  my experience comes from post loadout QL as before was many moons ago (AKA: I do not remember)  tl:dr; FFA is chaos to me"
QuakeLive,3dlqgo,reallyserious,5,Sat Jul 18 05:40:13 2015 UTC,to me FFA is pure chaos. So I am probably missing some nuance   It became chaos with loadouts. Before loadouts there was actually strategy involved. You had to stay away from the heavily populated places until you had gotten hold of a weapon. You could guard weapon spawn points because you knew people would go there. Before loadouts there were weapon specific ammo boxes so you had to know where you could find ammo for the different weapons and plan your route accordingly. This is all gone now. Now we have weapons from the start and generic ammo boxes which means practically infinite ammo if you just plan ever so slightly.
QuakeLive,3dlqgo,opaco,-3,Sat Jul 18 15:00:21 2015 UTC,Loadouts have one purpose and is to make the ffa learning curve much easier and smoother for new players or fun and enjoyable at least. They should have introduced them a long ago.

QuakeLive,3dlqgo,Yakumo_unr,5,Fri Jul 17 12:26:51 2015 UTC,"copying one of my first posts on it, as my thoughts havn't really changed :   ""I'm in a rush to get out so re-copying an old post of mine and racing through some additional points -  Most FFA games end up 8 or more players so:   It's even faster than it was before As in you die a lot faster, you're often lucky to get a single shot off at all. movement skill is irrelevant, never used because of 1 & 2 Timing items was hard before (as you have to actually get to them!) now it's impossible due to 1 & 2. You used to aim to get a good weapon, before quad, not any more. Weapon denial was a major tactic if a strong player favoured a weapon you tried to keep him off it as much as possible. Not any more. A tier4 spawner was never an easy frag after a fight, now it's almost always a death, this doesn't counter point 1 or 2. Loads of people will never change weapon, there's no point, they spawn with their favourite and get an ammo box anywhere. Bye bye altering the course of the game by trying to block a whatever weapon hoarder from his favourite gun, a major FFA gameplay mechanic.   I don't really mind about the powerup POI or damage plums really, or even the item timers, they're probably good all round ideas.  These things work ok in tier1/2 games where people can't aim or move for toffee, tier3 I don't know, maybe they still find it fun, tier4 - I'm sorry id, but nope nope nope.  The QL servers spawn with 8 players, but it's still a mess.  There is basically zero progression in the game now, maps barely make any difference to play, there's no incentive to move or pick up anything, playing for k:d is practically a myth, the only progression you will see is if a player really concentrates on working their aim, ignoring the fact they won't win this way. Or solely the progression of getting more frags.  It's fundamentally boring to watch, and I don't ever see anyone ever trying to run any level of tournament from it.  Dying is actually an ADVANTAGE as you spawn with a fresh stack and powerful weapons. Killing someone usually just gets you stabbed in the back by them respawning behind you,  Not having the SG as secondary basically means you WILL lose the game, the MG despite it's spread tweak is a completely dead weapon.  The only way it might work for QL is as a gateway to other modes, certainly no-one is very likely to play FFA for years any more.  I don't really see how this can be improved with keeping loadouts other than forcing spawns furthest from the action would reduce the 'lol backrocket' effect some except on the most crowded servers, but overall it's still just not a patch on Classic. At the very least making spawn-nearest never happen is something I've always campaigned for, but now it's really screaming for it :/""    source"
QuakeLive,3dlqgo,Yakumo_unr,3,Fri Jul 17 16:43:04 2015 UTC,"Obviously things changed slightly later on, there are no secondary weapons any more.  This just means that people that want to win almost universally chose to start with the shotgun. The only alternative for dominance is the RL on overly cramped fully packed maps where secondary kills from splash with the RL can be higher than with the shotgun spread.  The removal of the GL as a spawn option removed a small frustration (THE FLOOR IS GRENADES!) but having only one weapon at start actually made the game actually more boring than the first loadout iteration as +forward +attack is the best way to win, flat out, there are no stealth tactics, item collection tactics, the speed (as in frags per minute) lost to trying to do that isn't at all made up for with any resultant multi-frag session you may get from having a bit more armor/health/armor after seeking it out. That makes pretty much all item placement on a map completely redundant.  Basically it's best to just rush and fire at the first thing you see, and don't bother picking anything up, even ammo, it's just faster to suicide for a fresh start where you're more likely to get one or two frags before the next death.  It's completely the epitome of brainless casual game, as opposed to something where a variety of tactics could be weighed for the best outcome against various players.  Classic QL isn't entirely dead, it's what you get in Duel mode, and for FFA given a fair choice for it it would return, it has longevity, a learning curve, unlike such a casual mess."
QuakeLive,3dlqgo,gerdes88,4,Fri Jul 17 16:52:34 2015 UTC,"in my opinion it is the reduction of the challenge. I always liked a good challenge, and when the learning curve is really steep, yet rewarding, it really pays off to put a large effort into it. So i guess u can say, that it's too easy. Too child-friendly."
QuakeLive,3dlqgo,Yakumo_unr,5,Fri Jul 17 09:46:56 2015 UTC,"FFA is still not a competitive mode so why does it matter? but everyone raised good points in that TTK got >faster/ incentive to survive got lower, which very much colors engagements and gameplay. This is an approach >that I did not think about. To me FFA is just pure chaos (I think this is due to high pop maps) and not >relevant (competitively) so why not give them a weapon to practice with( this is why FFa'd personally Rail practice ftw).   FFA WAS actually very competitive for some, whereas I can pretty much guarantee loadout QL will NEVER have tournaments, and would't have even if it was released 10 years ago.  FFA was a kind of chaos that a good player could see patterns in, exploit situations, use various tactics. It was essentially duel but more to have to be aware of instead of basically always knowing where your one opponent was, you had to approach situations differently to be any good.   And of course there's quad damage to worry about, but even that gave the option of join the fight for it for possible high gains, or ignore it and clean up weak players around it which may get you more kills than dying in the scramble over the powerup. Now the chance of getting even 3 kills with quad is incredibly small as everyone has a powerful gun, everyone can see it's about to spawn, someone will inevitably spawn next to you if you get it, and you won't have been able to have hoarded any h/a before trying to get it.  To win loadouts you literally just need aim, but it isn't even about good aim as SG/RL is the best way to win and everyone is even more focused on just running straight forward at the first thing they see than classic FFA so they're even easier to hit as they're not dodging, so it's not even remotely good warmup for duel or CA players wanting to get into something quickly."

I want to add.. that if it wasn't clear, at the end of the day, the loadouts took a lot of the advantage of being a skilled player away, and made FFA into more of a slug-fest / brawl for which knowing what the hell you're doing has too little impact on your end game."
QuakeLive,3dlqgo,rottenmonkey,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:29:47 2015 UTC,"I rarely played FFA with more than 8 players. I don't think it's supposed to be chaotic. More chaotic than duel of course, but still ordered enough so that you could time/deny items and powerups. FFA with loadout is only about doing as much damage as possible in the few seconds you are alive. Maps, items, powerups are mostly irrelevant. So, yeah, it's quite boring."

You usually only download something when you actually want a custom HUD or if you're trying out someones elses config. Otherwise, you can change all the graphic/video settings yourself under Game Settings or using console commands.   Like you can just set Texture Detail to Low, Lighting Model to Lightmapped, and type in the console /cg_drawgun 3, to get that clear weapon.   But if the graphics are the way you like them right now, just go to Game Settings/Advanced/HUD and select the standard HUD Style or whatever it says. I think it should just overwrite your HUD."

(At least in Aus/NZ). (Check QLRanks.com for evidence)  I'm not sure what to do about this or if it's good for the growth of QL. CA is not a competitive mode, there isn't a lot of depth into it, and that's probably why it's played more. You can just sit back, not think about it too much and shoot away."

QuakeLive,3cl15p,uhufreak,3,Wed Jul 8 19:36:26 2015 UTC,"If timing is a weak-point for you then remembering the cycles of items is a good idea.  Remember the order of armors you pick up and the enemy pickups if you see them.  Learn roughly how long it takes to travel from one item to another, remember that megahealth being a 35second respawn will change when it appears in the cycle.  Of course doing heavily cycle-based gameplay will make you very predictable outside of your skill level but with enough games you can manage to counter this with positioning and decision making once your duel game has become stronger."

That being said I feel like dueling people exceedingly more skilled than you isn't the best way to go. While the general rule of thumb ""Play opponents better than you."" holds true I feel that doesn't mean you should dive into masochistic matchups.  For example, I find my game starts to improve if I play against people who are quite a bit better than me overall but not to the point where I don't stand any chance at beating them. This forces me to adapt, to learn, to watch, and to implement changes into my game rather than just get frustrated and have no clue where i need improvement as playing high ELO players tends to.  Basically you should want to play against players who are more skilled than yourself; however, don't take it to the extremes as people so often do.

You can also check opponents out on www.qlranks.com but obviously having a script that tells you in game is much quicker and easier.   I might be on tonight (I'm in EU so early evening your time I guess?) if not I should be on a bit on the weekend. Along with the rest of the dudes from our clan I can explain the basics on movement, weapon choice, timing, positioning etc. And from then on you just need to play play play, and as Pitchatan said above watch your demos back and see where you're going wrong.

QuakeLive,3cdixz,Zeholipael,6,Tue Jul 7 01:52:42 2015 UTC,"Aim can be practiced.  A lot of what you might consider ""good aiming"", imo, is finding the right angles to abuse while you are relatively safe to just focus on tracking/predicting your opponent and paying only the minimal amount of attention to dodging so you don't chew on some rockets/grenades.  What's your setup like?  Mouse sensitivity (inches or cm to a 360?  60hz LCD monitor?  Field of view?"
QuakeLive,3cdixz,KovaaK,1 point,Tue Jul 7 02:24:51 2015 UTC,"this is very well stated, and i would agree to what you said almost 100"
QuakeLive,3cdixz,maheep1,1 point,Tue Jul 7 05:07:04 2015 UTC,"600 DPI Sens 1 (I play Counter-Strike), 60Hz LCD, 100 FOV"
QuakeLive,3cdixz,WorstConnectionCSGO,1 point,Tue Jul 7 15:36:59 2015 UTC,"How is your moving and tracking with that sens? I used to play with ~55cm/360 for a little over a year and eventually went back to my old sensitivity of 24cm for quake. I track nearly the same(slightly worse), though my movement etc is way better. Though I still use the lower sensitivity on games like cs/db where tracking heads is more important. In quake you have to hit a larger hitbox.  My point is, imho you could probably lower your sensitivity a bit and still play fine, maybe even improve. Or maybe try out accel because you can actually configure it properly on quake(via client or pvh's drivers). That is if you want to keep such a low sens. If not maybe try raising it?   I know a lot will disagree with this or say that you should keep sensitivity the same across all games. At least in my case I don't play quake the same way I play cs. Having different sensitivities seems to work despite what people say. I know some top players would suggest this as well. Enough rambling I guess, do whatever works best for you!  100 fov is fine. 60hz might hold you back a bit on this game(at least in my experience).   Maybe watch a demo and use a lower timescale when you engage an opponent. When tracking are you leading too far ahead or too far behind? Is your crosshair ""jumpy"", as in you're prematurely moving your crosshair. Basically if an opponent dodges left you move your crosshair right before moving left. Look at overall mouse control and tweak based off that. Of course also look at your positioning and see if you maximize damage while taking as little as possible. Look at item control and such as well.   I have a feeling your sens is holding you a back though. If someone dodges really wide with LG and does a bunch of jukes low sens might hurt you, simply because they can do circles. As I said before, quake and cs don't really play the same. You don't need to use the same sens. As I said before its just my opinion.   As for as duel that is more item control/decision making versus aim. If you have any decent mouse control and can place yourself well, I would say you're fine."
QuakeLive,3cdixz,volchonokilli,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:01:11 2015 UTC,"I suggest to make your sens higher. ALOT. I was using even lower sens, but when I've started to raise it until 1.manynumbersafter (with 1800 dpi), my aim was getting better. Try it"
QuakeLive,3cdixz,geyseks,4,Fri Jul 10 14:51:48 2015 UTC,"I have awful aim too and have a background in ""team games"" but ended up enjoying duels the most. So dont count it out just because it seems intimidating."
QuakeLive,3cdixz,Neeeeple,3,Tue Jul 7 02:32:53 2015 UTC,"I am in the same boat as you. My aim typically sucks but my decision making is my biggest strength so in team games I try to be helpful by covering items, giving powerups to team mates, getting into fights with people who are chasing my teams capper and so on  There is definitely room for your style of play in quake and while most tournaments are 1v1, team games have a competitive scene too, At this years quakecon (end of this month) it is a team competition including TDM and CTF tournaments.  There are pickup channels for TDM and CTF and they play very often (not sure of the actual channel names). There are also pretty high skill CTF servers in the evenings with some really high level players in them so you can take advantage of these.  Make a team and enter some cups. Keep an eye on ESR, or plusforward or something for cup dates. They crop up fairly regularly.  But like geyseks said, bad aim doesnt mean duel isnt for you. Knowing when to take fights, keeping track of your opponents stack, timing well, settings traps and dealing safe unreturned damage can be more helpful than hitting 40% lg in an evenly stacked fight."
QuakeLive,3cdixz,bobwinters,1 point,Tue Jul 7 13:03:34 2015 UTC,"Personally I think 99% of people can get adequate aim with enough practice. You may not get a Tox like aim however hard you practice, however much time you spend on researching tips or whatever mice/sensitivity you have. But that doesn't matter and that's the great thing about Quake.   Aim isn't everything. If you don't have the greatest aim, you can always make it up by practising a different skill set. Such as timing/dodging/movement/positioning/decision making/patience. There's just so much depth to Quake that you can always focus your practice on improving another skill set instead.  Example, look at Agent. I'm willing to bet his aim is probably the worst out of the current top 100 players, yet he's probably ranked in the top 5, if not, top 10 in the world."
QuakeLive,3cdixz,frx_,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:07:59 2015 UTC,Aim is a skill that either comes naturally or doesn't but can be improved to the same high level in both cases. What's most important sens-wise is to just pick a reasonable sensitivity and stick with it.

QuakeLive,3bolbl,Auxx,3,Wed Jul 1 07:43:29 2015 UTC,"cg_autohop 1. (you can disable it via the hud)  Without autohop, if you wanted to jump continuously (such as strafe jumping), you had to keep pressing the jump key each time you wanted to jump. With autohop, you can now hold the jump key and it will continuously jump for you.   This now makes it possible to make consecutive jumps where the ledges are so close to each other that without autohop, it is physically impossible to hit the jump key faster enough."
QuakeLive,3bolbl,bobwinters,2,Wed Jul 1 11:05:18 2015 UTC,this is basically a ski script in tribes 1 and what is largely killed the series in sequels when they started setting jump rates and things like that slowing down how fast the autohop ski script could work and slowing down the gameplay  i think autohop is great

QuakeLive,3av06a,appleee,6,Wed Jun 24 02:57:36 2015 UTC,"Summer definitely plays a role in that, but I think some of the changes have been pushing some of the frequent players away lately.  But I totally agree, its been a dead man walking for sure.  Something I think plays a big role in this is the community. I've been a solid casual even way back in pre-Q3A days but never 'elite'; lately jumping into some games and getting heckled and asked to leave when I've been playing for 5 minutes is ridiculous. All the hardcore types are really pushing the mid-level players away, all because they care about elo and other such nonsense. So many try-hards and a-holes really detracts from the experience; especially when there are a dozen servers near you with any players at all, it's amazing anybody is still there aside from top tier duel players.  Its not the Quake I knew as kid."

In some cases, its from specs who just joined in, and want me (or others) to leave to 'open a spot for the good players'.  With this sort of attitude, its amazing there are ANY new players trying it out. This is why the game is slowly fading away for all but the hardest of hardcore. This is why there are so few servers when there used to be thousands. This is why id keeps mucking with the formula, only to further push some players away.  I'll stop the woe-is-me drama stuff, it's not my point anyway. I still enjoy playing the game when I have the time, nostalgia is a real pain some times."

QuakeLive,3av06a,KatakiY,9,Tue Jun 23 22:07:10 2015 UTC,Alot.   -Voices are 'not great'   -Different game modes split the community  -Loadouts were a bad idea and the addition of them made many players leave the game  -3rd party elo/mm bots are being used by most servers so why hasn't this feature been added yet?  -Quakelive routing in NA is atrocious  -No integration yet with steam? Why are my QL friends different than Steam friends?  -Most of the menus are very not intuitive and poorly designed (being it was just ported from a web browser and seemingly not updated for steam client)  This is just off the top of my head and I'm sure other people could throw a couple more in here.
QuakeLive,3av06a,-aether-,7,Tue Jun 23 22:55:18 2015 UTC,voices    I dont have an issue :(    -Different game modes split the community   Huh? Should they get rid of some? I mean I guess cutting it down to duel/ca/ctf/tdm/freeze might be a good idea and remove everything else but really no one plays anything else either>   Loadouts were a bad idea and the addition of them made many players leave the game   I somewhat agree but when I played with a group of completely new people (about 15-20) I dominiated (as is expected when someone who plays q3vs someone who sucks at FPS) but the loadouts at least allowed them to feel like they were competing. Without load outs I was just constantly picking up quad and all the armor and no one was haivng fun.    -Quakelive routing in NA is atrocious   Agreed its fucking bad   No integration yet with steam? Why are my QL friends different than Steam friends?   So annoying! And that goes into your next point such a garbage interface. I mean it feels like a shitty web browser game still.   Still its the best F2P Arena shooter out there.  I feel like they need better ranking and more players. I also think the game needs a better way to spend money on it to support development. As is I pay 30 a year for prime just to host servers (which is great imo). The reason it has shit development is the game doesnt make much money.

Just look at all the biggest games on twitch right now - hearthstone, league, dota, CSGO, hots, sc2 - they all have one-click matchmaking systems that makes it extremely simple and easy for players of any skill level to hop on and instantly get a game against similar skill leveled players.

On the off chance I do get into something with a ping less than 80 or so I can't compete because everyone else in the arean will have a 40 or less.   I might as well go in one legged and blind.

QuakeLive,3av06a,Pinecone,7,Tue Jun 23 22:42:05 2015 UTC,"No. I was playing QL 1v1 back in 09-11 and it was still tremendously hard to find players at my skill level. When I started I had to lose every month straight just to get the basics because of the learning curve and almost everyone I played against had years of experience already.  Now imagine anyone trying to get into the game today. The ridiculous limits for free players doesn't help either. You have to really love the game or understand why it's so important to learn Quake to get into it but of course the amount of players who are willing to do so these days is in the single digits worldwide.  There's always going to be a popular game around that will attract the casual crowd.  In fact, the reasons I stated above are also why SC2 is dying in popularity."
QuakeLive,3av06a,tbone13billion,3,Tue Jun 23 23:58:13 2015 UTC,"The argument against that is Dota 2, it's huge and attracting more players and it's extremely difficult to master. The difference between Quake and Dota is the amount of support it gets from it's developers and the insane feature set it has (Have you seen it's in game spectating?) With regards to SC2, blizzard have infinite resources and it makes it sad how lazy they are when it comes to building a brand. All their titles show the same sort of laziness.  Someone is going to come out with an arena FPS, they are going to do it right and it's going to be huge, but I don't think that's going to be id."
QuakeLive,3av06a,niioan,4,Wed Jun 24 00:32:29 2015 UTC,"but with DOTA 2's huge player base skill matching actually works for the most part, so you are not thrown to the wolves. In Qlive if you want to play, you gotta take whats available."

QuakeLive,3av06a,tbone13billion,2,Thu Jun 25 14:18:29 2015 UTC,"Dota is extremely difficult, if it didn't have matchmaking games would be stomps every game, just like quake. It took me like 2 years to get to a high level in quake, I've been playing dota for about a year and a half, and I'm probably still below average. (Albeit, I had a lot more time when I played quake). If it's so easy why do we have the same players/teams win and do well all the time? I'm sure some randoms would push and win some money in it? I don't see fatal1ty playing dota?  Anyway my point was that Dota has the feature set that Quake needed 5 years ago. It's over, the game is dead. Hope that Reflex has a decent feature set at release or that will be dead too. Any competitive FPS arena game released in future HAS to have these things to be successful, otherwise they will all turn into casual COD."
QuakeLive,3av06a,Nimitz14,1 point,Thu Jun 25 14:49:19 2015 UTC,"let me spell it out for you:  any game is difficult to master, the difference between them consists in how many options you have that will let you master it, for example, quake movement is an additional option that few other fps games have which lets better players distinguish themselves. Another example, in Brood War -> SC2 they simplified the mechanics - no matter whether that was a good decision or not - the fact that they did so lead to a reduction in the amount of options a player has to distinguish themselves.  Games like quake and starcraft are held in such high regard because they gave a player lots of options with which they could show and use their skill. MOBAs are a joke in comparison, like it's not even in the same order of magnitude. I could beat a beginner in Starcraft 2 with only workers. I'm not joking (I was mid-GM). In quake I could do it with melee+mg (melee only would be hard on sinister :D ). You cannot do things like these in one dimensional games like a moba.  i do agree with you they've done a great job on features in dota"
QuakeLive,3av06a,tbone13billion,1 point,Thu Jun 25 15:24:51 2015 UTC,"Ok, so you actually know nothing about dota. Yeah the mechanics aren't that hard, but decision making is more advanced. An example I can give is in quake you have 8 weapons, and each have their uses and times to use it, e.g. Rockets are better close range than rail, lg is better medium range, you should switch to shotgun when the enemy is low. Dota is like that, except with 1000 weapons.   Your example regarding beating beginners is exactly the same in Dota, 2k MMR will destroy a 1k MMR, a 6k MMR will destroy a 4k MMR. A 6k MMR could probably beat a 2k MMR with only right clicks and no items. I get what you are saying, but you know nothing about the game and you feel that Quake has to be the Uber most awesome super skilled game. To be honest though I know nothing about other Mobas and have only recently started playing Dota 2 after playing quake for 20 years or so. Although I did play a couple of games of Heroes of the Storm, and that is exactly what you think dota is. (It's horrible low skill shit) But a good analogy is COD is to Quake what Hots is to Dota."

I'm not going to go through the hassle of installing a .deb package on my Gentoo instance. When id dropped official Linux support (my ability to just hit the Play Now button and jump into an FFA), they made it more work than I feel it is worth just to play a stupid game and kill a couple of hours every now and then.

QuakeLive,3assdm,bobwinters,1 point,Wed Jun 24 07:31:37 2015 UTC,I seem to recall the last 125fps final before QuakeCon Cypher won. And won quite impressively. I would be surprised if Cypher can beat Evil this year more so than last year because of that.

QuakeLive,3assdm,tomlette,2,Wed Jun 24 19:49:52 2015 UTC,"He's played in a few NA tournaments for the last couple of months. I've watched Sparks spec and played him a few times.  Just another rant by me :-O. Sparks has said a few times in his stream that Rapha is playing very good lately. His W/L ratio on QLRanks.com is very good. What impressive me most is the time he's put into practising, but also his aim. The game against Chance just a few days ago, he was shooting +60% rg on Aerowalk. We all know Rapha has the best strategy in QL and if he loses a game, it's because of his aim. If his aim is at the level of Tox, he will be unbeatable. But realistically if it's at the level of say Spartie, he will be very hard to beat."

QuakeLive,3a8u4z,wideving,3,Thu Jun 18 05:46:38 2015 UTC,"Hi! New to this sub. Well I was going on a nostalgia trip when I remembered this show years back called Quake Republic on a channel called NOW TV. Thought you guys might shed some background on it as I can't find any by googling it.  EDIT: Found more info, thanks reddit search: http://www.reddit.com/r/QuakeLive/comments/2veoba/quake_ctf_3_league_games_from_2003_are_still/"
QuakeLive,3a8u4z,snaaaarf,5,Thu Jun 18 03:36:08 2015 UTC,Awesome! I was in Clan Dominion :) briefly shown there as the 6th team on the league table. Good times!
QuakeLive,3a8u4z,snaaaarf,2,Thu Jun 18 06:06:47 2015 UTC,Woah! I knew someone in here would know something about it! So were you guys aware that it was televised or nah?
QuakeLive,3a8u4z,snaaaarf,3,Thu Jun 18 09:00:16 2015 UTC,"Oh we most definitely knew this was televised. There was a time when our clanleader NeXus even did a phone interview right after the game to comment on the match :)  I thought it was mostly going to be shown on sattelite tv, so we didn't think audiences were going to be that big. I don't believe they ever were..?  The clanwars themselves were not televised live though afaik... Lots of editing afterwards, and they probably only broadcast those games that were worth commenting on.  It was a time where the Quake3 scene mostly revolved around the official leagues to the likes of ""Jolt CTF"" or even ""Barrysworld"".   This NOW ctf league really was a sort of separate, invite-only type of thing, and lived for only one or two seasons. It featured teams from first as well as lower divisions.  It was taken seriously as a league, but it was very different in that every game was played the one single map, specifically built for this league. As it's a small map, teams were also 4v4, whereas most official leagues catered for 5v5 teams."

QuakeLive,3a1gsw,SoInsightful,6,Tue Jun 16 15:05:20 2015 UTC,Yeah i'm worried it may be locked at 60 FPS like Doom 3 and Rage. If that's the case it'll never be a serious arena shooter. That would be a real shame. We'd be back to waiting for a Quake 5 announcement.
QuakeLive,3a1gsw,Neeeeple,5,Tue Jun 16 15:09:23 2015 UTC,Since pretty much the beginning. CRT monitors back in the early Quake days had much higher refresh rates than the standard consumer 60hz monitors we see everywhere today. All the competitive arena players are on at least 120hz these days.
QuakeLive,3a1gsw,Ottetal,11,Tue Jun 16 16:43:56 2015 UTC,It has nothing to do with the game looking better and everything to do with seeing more information on the screen. Have you actually played a game like Quake Live on a 120hz monitor? It's a huge difference. When shit is moving really fast you get twice as many frames showing it to you. It's pretty straightforward.
QuakeLive,3a1gsw,ASAPscotty,3,Tue Jun 16 17:04:17 2015 UTC,"Ask literally anyone with a 120Hz or 144Hz monitor how it's affected their LG accuracy. Or read this thread on ESR.  I played on a 144Hz monitor for a week and was hitting about 43percent LG on average, on my monitor (60Hz) I very rarely hit over 37%. I didn't believe it at first but it's definitely a real thing."
QuakeLive,3a1gsw,InFerYes,2,Tue Jun 16 17:25:52 2015 UTC,"I play on 60Hz, the LG accuracy on my profile has dropped down to 40% (3000+ matches), and I have a 2300+ CA elo (~80% wins).  I have no doubt that I'd probably play at least slightly better on a faster monitor, but the fact that everyone here seems to think that 120 Hz is a minimum rudimentary criterium for high-level FPS play—to the point where any opposing view is downvoted to oblivion and referred to as trolling—is hilariously absurd."

The only thing I'd hope for was a remake of Quake Live or Q3A with better models and proper matchmaking with a way to help noobs to get into the game. Old announcer and screw loadouts."
QuakeLive,3a1gsw,LoneStar64,4,Wed Jun 17 13:26:17 2015 UTC,"The issue is that people don't like to play games with dated graphics no matter how good they are, so developers end up spending more money on graphics than actualy game design.

QuakeLive,3a1gsw,tbone13billion,2,Thu Jun 18 14:02:09 2015 UTC,"Doom Multiplayer showing, yes, not Doom itself. And I hope Bethesda can overlook any of the silly press about violence, as most of its core fans are at least in their late 20s. Apparently the multi has a very Titanfall-esque feel to it, something far removed from any quake multi.  I don't think there's too much of an overlap, as the main selling point of a Doom game will always be its single-player (and much anticipated SnapMap), whereas the quake5 was intended to be a reveal much in the same way id teased Doom at quakecon last year."
QuakeLive,3a1gsw,siirna,2,Wed Jun 17 02:42:27 2015 UTC,"Titanfall? I did get a Halo vibe at some points though.  The problem is with the MP, to get people excited you have to compete with what is currently popular too. If they added 50 more guns! Levels show destruction! 20 Vehicles! SCORE STREAKS!!!! PERSISTENT STAAATSSSS!! LEVELING SYSTEM!!!!!   You know, just keep throwing crazy terms up on the screen. Titanfall looked super exciting before it actually came out. And that was ORBITAL DROPPING FUCKING GIANT MECHS AND ITS EXACTLY LIKE COD!!!!!  And, ultimately it still didn't matter as people dropped the game fairly quickly. lmao! And honestly, its not a bad game at all too."
QuakeLive,3a1gsw,HappySlice,2,Thu Jun 18 08:36:21 2015 UTC,"Titanfall has no community now because it never managed to build one to begin with. A guy I know named WarSpirit used to play Titanfall ""competitively"" and there just weren't enough players.  Frankly imo Titanfall is an awful game, that's why it didn't sell. I played the beta and I don't think they fixed any gameplay-related problems since that beta. They probably fixed crashes and some things that didn't need fixing. But they didn't fix how mouse input is applied per frame in some weird way that means that your sensitivity varies with your framerate. Add to that the movement system which is robust in theory but doesn't complement the map layouts at all. The maps look like COD maps and that's kinda how they play except now you can be on every rooftop. And that sounds infinitely better than what the game actually feels like."

QuakeLive,39xwj3,reallyserious,2,Tue Jun 16 08:48:24 2015 UTC,"I'm so excited about this tool. They didnt mention ctf in the announcement but I can expect (or make) a version of it with this.  People on indie games such as reflex have been making insanely good maps, imagine what people will do with tools like this on a title as big as Doom.  If Doom is lacking anything in gameplay it looks like the community can solve that with this"

I think this latest (unbelievably) underwhelming update is going to be one of the final nails in its coffin. There are better arena fps games coming out like Toxikk and Reflex, where the devs actually listen to the community and push out regular updates.  Players just aren't on this game as much..."
QuakeLive,39xwj3,-aether-,3,Wed Jun 17 16:11:27 2015 UTC,"My only issue with Toxikk and Reflex is that they're indie-remakes of Q3cpma/cpm and UT.  Never was a fan of UT, couldn't grab me.

Loadouts and their rework were the biggest ones done to Quake 3/Live since their conception, lack of updates is not it. Quake is an old small community, it wont die but it wont grow either  Toxikk and Reflex combined don't have have the userbase of QL, and they are still very early in development even if they look promising"

I always get in matches with folks that have pings much lower than mine. If I bust my ass I can compete for a bit, but after a couple of matches at a high ping I just get frustrated.  High pings have always been the bane of Quake for me. Even a small difference between two players puts the lower ping player at a great advantage."
QuakeLive,39xwj3,SCphotog,1 point,Mon Jun 15 19:27:00 2015 UTC,Play Xonotic. It's faster with great maps from Quake and has its own unique ones. Its free and plays great with amazing customization.

QuakeLive,39xwj3,BroDoYouEvenSysadmin,1 point,Tue Jun 16 02:32:50 2015 UTC,"In NA, there's plenty of CA and FFA servers all day every day.   Generally at least one full Freeze Tag server and a couple CTF servers. A few Duel servers depending on time of day. You should get practice partners for Duel. Very few pub TDM servers.  I ping <20 to LA, 40 to WA, 60 to Dallas, 80-90 to Chicago/DC, and 100 to Ashburn/Toronto. This covers the most popular NA servers from West to East. If you're only getting 150 ping at best, something is wrong on your end.  I used to only play on closer servers, but I find that 100 ping is fine for me for casual CA/FFA, and this allows me to play with everyone in the continent."
QuakeLive,39xwj3,b4u0vbd602zx66wkvnv4,1 point,Tue Jun 16 12:22:49 2015 UTC,It isn't on my end considering I play at respectable ping from where I live on some games.

I too have noticed an up-tick in apparent hacking. I've noticed a lot of sloppy cheaters in CA and a few who I think are hiding it very well.

QuakeLive,38cy6s,sirAMPR,3,Wed Jun 3 15:02:35 2015 UTC,"If you like cpma, you might want to check out Reflex since it has very similar physics and gameplay.  It has an arena mode that is similar.  Plus, the netcode in Reflex is the best I've ever played with, and the built in map editor has already resulted in over 200 community maps in half a year of pre-alpha."
QuakeLive,38cy6s,KovaaK,3,Wed Jun 3 13:14:14 2015 UTC,nice! tnx for the tip. that is exactly the gameplay i was looking for
QuakeLive,38cy6s,lrdchaos3,5,Wed Jun 3 15:56:28 2015 UTC,"Well, that's just not true."
QuakeLive,38cy6s,KovaaK,4,Wed Jun 3 19:18:11 2015 UTC,"More specifically, the netcode stops having compensation over 80ms.  So at that point, you lead as if you are in VQ3 with no timenudge or anything, but you take 80ms away from your ping still.  In most real world scenarios, it's amazing."
QuakeLive,38cy6s,Kered13,1 point,Wed Jun 3 23:26:01 2015 UTC,"I've found that it gets much harder to hit rockets at high ping. On a low ping server, I can hit great rockets, but above ~40 or so my rockets become wildly inaccurate. It feels like I'm playing QL at like 80, or TF2 at over 100. It feels really bad."
QuakeLive,38cy6s,KovaaK,1 point,Wed Jun 3 19:24:45 2015 UTC,"It's tricky because they don't display rockets until the server confirms they exist, but they actually are unlagged (again up to 80ms) in that the server will spawn them forward as if you fired them at the correct time.  I kept arguing for them to make it display a client-side predicted model of the rocket before it really existed so that it is easier for people to see how they should be aiming rockets, but they more or less ran out of time on the netcode and had to move on to other things.  That feature might make it in a second pass (as well as client-side prediction of knockback from explosives)."

QuakeLive,36voxo,Mocorn,1 point,Sun May 24 21:59:36 2015 UTC,"Gamers across the world have long since figured out the best position for this. Tilt the chair back while maintaining a neutral spine. Raise the seat until your arms can rest neutral and comfortably on the desk (preferably a U-desk) releasing stress from your shoulders. Push the keyboard far enough in that you can rest almost your entire under arms on the desk while gaming. Flat screens and U-desks help with this a lot. Make sure the monitor is almost level with your head so you don't have to look downwards.    Thing to note. Everyone who sits a lot run the very real risk of getting atrophied abs, hamstrings and glutes. As a result you can end up with anterior pelvic tilt. This in turn can lead to lower back pain. To fix or counter this, make sure to train these muscles (and others if possible) on a regular basis."

Fighting for weapons, even if it's a 5sec spawntimer is pretty much the only skill you need in FFA and semi-decent aim (seeing as walking through the map to the weapon of choice can kill you 50% of the time).

I can see the fun in playing team modes, of course, but watching that shit is just a let-down. The spectator view is never on the person you would want to spectate (with duel atleast you have a 50% chance and you can't miss a fight) and you never know for sure if there is teamwork going on or if the winning team just had higher average mechanical skill. It's not like football where you can see the entire pitch at once and keep your eyes on and around the ball. In CTF you can pay attention to where the flags are so it's like football with two balls and you can't overlook the entire field. TDM on the other hand is just a complete clusterfuck. What's the appeal? Seriously."
QuakeLive,36depw,JigglyWiggly_,-3,Tue May 19 13:11:15 2015 UTC,"Go watch a game of csgo.  Also if it's CA, just have the camera on me."
QuakeLive,36depw,Field_Of_View,1 point,Tue May 19 14:05:52 2015 UTC,"GO is a great example because it's really a hybrid of baseball + TDM. There is one bomb so the view should always be on the bomb carrier or a camping defender on a site, or on someone close to the bomb if it's dropped/planted. Either way, the bomb is on everyone's mind and that makes CS accessible for viewers.  CTF, by comparison, is like playing football with two balls. You have two critical objects that can each be anywhere in the map. How do you capture that with just one camera? You can't, plain and simple!  Now personally, I find Counter Strike's movement and shooting boring to watch! I am in no way saying that Quake needs a CS like mode. But I'm questioning if team modes really are the best vehicle to expand arena shooters in esports as so many in the scene seem to believe. Going back to regular sports for examples: Tennis is a duel sport and quite successful. And baseball may look like a team sport but only two people actually matter at any point. Guy #1 hits the ball, then guy #2 tries to catch it while guy #1 is running. It's easy to capture visually. CTF and TDM never will be.  Imo Quake duels are a lot more engaging to watch so I would just capitalize on that and figure out ways to make that even better for the viewers. For instance, how about we end the cancer that is play by play commentary. Zoot and Shpuld can talk about meta game when they feel like it, they just don't feel like it often enough. What needs to end is ""nice rail, great rockets, and he gets the frag"". Someone needs to make the meta game accessible to new/recent viewers instead of stating the obvious. When that happens Quake duel viewership will explode."
QuakeLive,36depw,JigglyWiggly_,3,Tue May 19 14:29:44 2015 UTC,"The camera isn't on the bomb carrier. It's usually on the entry fragger on the T side or the ct watching the angle.  Then the camera shifts to the team with less players alive to see if they can pull something.   A lot of people watch CS, so they are doing something right.  I do think an objective gametype should be the main focus for the next Quake game if they actually want the game to not die 1 year in."
QuakeLive,36depw,Field_Of_View,3,Tue May 19 14:34:36 2015 UTC,"How I described CS casting is frankly how I think it should be done.   A lot of people watch CS, so they are doing something right.   Meh. A lot of people play CS. Same as DOTA/LOL, the ""esports"" potential of those game correlates with the enormous size of their playerbase. Is it really that great to watch, and are the casters really competent? Or is the audience simply made up of active players? Just because something is successful doesn't mean it's good (talking about the streams).  Meanwhile, QL is tiny and I got attracted to it after watching that infamous rapha/cooller match, or rather the commentary where rapha explains his strategy. I watched QL duels regularly for months before even installing the game. I honestly think Quake has great appeal as a pure spectator sport if only it's presented right and sadly it rarely is. If fazz took casting seriously he could be the hero we need. Especially if he can regularly bring on other pros as guests."
QuakeLive,36depw,Lesteriuse,2,Tue May 19 15:03:17 2015 UTC,"i think youre vastly underestimating the viewer/player ratio of csgo compared to dota or league, at least when youre talking about the western audience  esl one katowice got up to 600k viewers on twitch, which is actually larger than the all time concurrent player peak. there was literally more people watching than playing the game  compare that to dota and the 400kish it got during ti4 and its 1.2m player peak, there's a pretty big disparity"

I didn't pay too much weight on the phrasing, admittedly. I just meant to bring across that spectating CS should be all about what will happen to the bomb.  The biggest flaw of CS as a spectator sport is that Ts can win by kills. It's like Harry Potter's Quidditch where you've got all these different types of players and three goals on each side and I don't remember how many balls - and at the end of the day fucking Mary Sue Potter gets his special role as a ""seeker"" and wins matches single-handedly, completely ignoring everything else that goes on on the pitch. That's what it's like when you pay attention to CS strategy and why most casting is play by play shit. You wonder which site are they going for, do the CTs know etc. and then pop, pop, pop everyone's dead and the bomb was completely irrelevant."

QuakeLive,369rl7,zypsilon,3,Sun May 17 22:40:38 2015 UTC,"That's true. My experience though has been that there are roughly as many QL servers I actually would play on as in Reflex, which is amazing since Reflex is only in Alpha."

QuakeLive,369rl7,kirreen,6,Mon May 18 12:03:02 2015 UTC,"I agree that movement isn't the same, but you can strafe just like in quake. Also, even if the item timers are visible in Reflex, that doesn't mean playing quake won't help you learn timing items in Reflex. You'll get a feel for when an item will spawn, and the amount of time you need to get there.  While I agree that Reflex or CPMA is the best way to practice for Reflex, they have way smaller communities than Quake, so finding a duel partner at your level will be a lot harder."

QuakeLive,369rl7,zypsilon,2,Mon May 18 12:51:36 2015 UTC,Can confirm. Actually playing Reflex a couple of times made me better in QL because the former is really faster.

For one thing, the map format and map tools ingame cannot be done with stock q3 source as it would take a complete overhaul of the renderpipeline aswell as netcode to handle everything. Other then that the cpma source code isnt exactly a secret as it has been documented by the developers, hell people have even ported over the physics to other engines that arent even connected to quake at all(unity,unrealengine etc).

QuakeLive,36ard6,scottchiefbaker,1 point,Mon May 18 03:33:27 2015 UTC,"16:9 support isn't even hard to make. If I have understood it correctly the things needed to fix it is in the ""wrong"" parts of the code. I.e. you need to make it a mod in order to override the default. Or you could of course say ""screw it"" and just change the core code. But both these alternatives makes the updated client incompatible with the vanilla q3 client. Compatibility is an expressed design goal of ioq3 so there we have a dilemma.   If someone were to make the mod to support 16:9 and wrap it all in a pretty installer I'm sure there would be a community around it in no time. There are even bits of the relevant code posted on the forum IIRC."

Not everyone is a fan of Duel. Other mode of Quake... are still Quake. Duel might be the signature mode - for some - but other modes still has great movement, weapons, maps and long ttk (which is rather rare today).  I'm glad that your favorite mode was unaffected by the updates. I'm actually jealous; truly. But also: you're hardcore, other people who don't think like you are just casuals... Do you lick your jizz off the mirror afterwards?  QL went down the toilet for me and many other casual players as you put it. I miss this amazing game."

While we're almost all Europe based and play on European servers (ie. expect your ping to be rubbish), we can still explain the game to you/teach you relevant things depending on how new you are (ie. weapon selection, starting spawns, in control and out of control play, important angles etc on maps.) We've currently got one (I think it's just one) American who comes on and plays a lot, he's very new and of course plays regularly on American servers. But as there doesn't seem to be another clan like us over in the USA, he comes and plays with us a lot too as to learn all the aspects of the game (other than hitting your shots hah) your ping wont matter.   So if you want to add us the clan leader is: N0cturn3  And you're welcome to add me (ROBO) and another dude (ZITA).  glfh :)  Edit: And I should mention that starting ELO is 1200, however if you've never played any aspect of quake, do expect it to drop a bit. Ie if you play someone 1250 you might get destroyed and be confused as they're 'only' 50 above you, when actually your true starting elo might be around 1000 or less even. Then again I've heard that ELO's in the USA are usually higher for players of comparable skill to Europe so maybe 1200 is actually a reflection of starting skill anyways.

There are obviously exceptions, and some of the best players I know originally came from insta. That being said, I believe that playing a ton of insta reinforces and rewards bad habits. In insta there is really no incentive to move around the map at all if you're in a strong position.

QuakeLive,34td96,newbad,13,Mon May 4 12:05:40 2015 UTC,"Author of minqlbot here. Thought I'd give you my point of view.  People pay for Pro to have their own server, with their own rules and standards. It makes perfect sense for me that it's completely up to the server owner's discretion who gets to play on it. Any less control over the server and you'd basically just be paying to have a server with a customizable name and a couple of cvars. That'd be unacceptable.  And sure, I agree that using the ""Play Now"" button sending people to servers that immediately kick them is a bad thing, but that doesn't warrant removing a server owner's control over the server. A couple of years ago, back when the subscription model was different, people would regularly play on non-player owned servers. Seeing as they disabled map voting on them now, it's quite understandable why people don't care much for those anymore. If the kicking is considered an issue by id, then perhaps they ought to stop spawning crippled servers that no one but FFA players care about.  The main issue, in my opinion, is that the current tier system is not adequate as skill quantification. There's a huge skill discrepancy in tier 4, and regular shuffle doesn't do a good enough job most of the time. A second, but fairly big, issue is that the current system doesn't allow you to ban specific players from your server for any length of time longer than the current map (and even during the same map, sometimes players can join despite having used \kickban on them). It still blows my mind that the latter issue hasn't been addressed after all these years. In fact, being able to keep obnoxious assholes off my server automatically was initially the only goal and motivation for writing the bot.  At this point, if they were to disallow the bot, I'd be pretty upset. However, if they successfully manage to address those two issues, I'd happily accept it. The way everyone plays just to increase some stupid number on a third-party site (and constantly quit mid-game to avoid decreasing it) is pretty disgusting, but I still consider it the best solution at the moment."
QuakeLive,34td96,MinoMino,0,Mon May 4 19:37:12 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply Mino, and btw I think its a brilliant workaround for the clearly inadequate banning system we have (as well as shuffle, permissions, and ability to keep server running etc lol).   I don't think disallowing the bot is a good idea, I do however think that having it on regular public servers causes a lot of problems for newcomers, especially when the server host doesn't feel the need to put in the title : ""Minobot, minimum elo"" etc.   I understand that the server host would kick a new player after joining even without the bot, after manually checking their elo, but when there is no indication of this before joining, it deters new players considerably when finally figure out why they can't join anything.  For me, the 4 main servers running with reasonable ping are all using Minobot, with elo minimums as well as minimum # of games played.  This basically means I have to play a server in europe instead of north america, and completely ruin the game for them (because of ping in the 100s), since I am unable to join or even see any tier 3/lower servers.  I guess the two best case scenarios without getting rid of minobot would be A) Quakelive gets a new matchmaking system (which sync has hinted at:D ), or Minobot forces the serverhost to have an indication in the title of server that mino is running."
QuakeLive,34td96,MinoMino,1 point,Mon May 4 22:15:13 2015 UTC,"Like I said to /u/_agentsm1th, I'll be looking into making the user aware of why he/she was kicked. The fact that you can't find a server to play on is quite unfortunate. I still think it's up to the owner to decide who gets to play there, though. Having a private server instead, like you suggested in another post, makes it impossible to keep a healthy population, so I don't see that as a viable solution.   I guess the two best case scenarios   Personally, I think that the best scenario by far would be id making non-player spawned servers function like player spawned servers, just without admins. That way, you could connect to one of those, ""\cv map your_favorite_map"", and wait a bit for people to connect, just like you could a while ago. You'd start seeing regular servers being used a lot more again, at which point id could also make the Play Now button only send them to those servers, which would solve the issue of players being kicked shortly after joining.  I also can't force anything with the bot, just change default behavior. The bot's open source, so people are free to change it as they wish given they follow the license."
QuakeLive,34td96,_agentsm1th,-2,Tue May 5 15:41:23 2015 UTC,"And sure, I agree that using the ""Play Now"" button sending people to servers that immediately kick them is a bad thing   You think?    The main issue, in my opinion, is that the current tier system is not adequate as skill quantification.    The main issue is that your bot is far more half assed than anything the QL devs have done with ""tiers"" or ""matchmaking"". You're trying to address the mediocrity of the current tier system by creating a horrible user experience with minobot. When the script kicks people, their screen simply freezes at ""awaiting snapshot"", and remains that way until they press esc. There's no indication (other than in the console log) that they were even kicked, let alone a reason given. How anyone can consider this to be a remotely acceptable UX is beyond me.  So... A new user joins QuakeLive, clicks Play Now, and gets auto kicked by some T3 server because T3 minobot servers disallow new accounts to prevent ""slummers"" and ""hackers"". Let's say they discover the match browser, perhaps after web_reload'ing 5,000 times -- now what? Join a T4 or unrestricted server? Nope autokick for low elo. There could conceivably be a situation where a new user can't connect to any populated server. And they won't even know they were being kicked. Then they uninstall."
QuakeLive,34td96,MinoMino,4,Mon May 4 20:48:02 2015 UTC,"You're trying to address the mediocrity of the current tier system by creating a horrible user experience with minobot.   I'm not. Perhaps that's a consequence, but that's definitely not what I'm trying to.   When the script kicks people, their screen simply freezes at ""awaiting snapshot"", and remains that way until they press esc. There's no indication (other than in the console log) that they were even kicked, let alone a reason given.   I know about this and I tried for a short period to delay the kick so that players had time to load the map and give them a reason for the kick through \tell, but then the obnoxious assholes I try to keep off my server start spamming chat or start votes to kick people and whatnot during that period.  What can I say. Like I said, I don't disagree with it being awful for new players, but I still consider it to be the best alternative at the moment. My bot's simply using the very commands id provided us to ban people. The QL client not being able to handle getting kicked during loading is an unfortunate bug. A proper ban system would solve this."
QuakeLive,34td96,_agentsm1th,2,Mon May 4 21:38:12 2015 UTC,"If someone being obnoxious ends up getting banned, then autokicking them at ""awaiting snapshot"" isn't a terrible thing. The problem is that it's the default behavior for all types of autokicks, including for new accounts, low elo, high elo, whatever the case might be. As I said before, new users will have absolutely no clue what's even going on -- they don't know they're being kicked."
QuakeLive,34td96,MinoMino,2,Mon May 4 22:28:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'll look into delaying kicks for the rating and account age filters. The reason I hadn't done it for account age is that there's a very dedicated guy who's banned for being an asshole who literally has dozens of accounts just so he can do his thing on my server for some minutes until it's painfully obvious who it is and gets banned again, just to log on another account and try again. When it comes to the rating filter, the default behavior is to let people spectate the game, but not play, so I didn't think much of it.  The bot's been around for nearly two years now, but only recently has it blown up. I was surprised to hear that OP didn't even manage to find a server without the bot in NA, so I guess it's way more widespread that I initially though, so I can see where you're coming from. Expect a change to the kicking behavior in the next few days."
QuakeLive,34td96,rammsdell,2,Tue May 5 15:07:16 2015 UTC,"I dont feel like this is MinoMino's fault.  The bot has to be properly configured by the user who's running it.  The users running the servers are in control of what the bot can and cannot do.    Typically I disable the auto-kick features and skill level restrictions.  I also play with 30 or so regulars in the server so I add plenty of permissions to several people to keep the server in check and let them decide if someone should be kicked/banned(typically for trolling or hacking).    I think it's better to have someone in the server with some human decision rather than auto-assuming guilt based on stats, but some people dont have that luxury or don't have enough people to trust to help maintain the server so they have to rely on some of the auto-kick features especially if they aren't watching the server often.  Most people I've seen setup minobot servers in the US barely had the know-how to set it up or haven't fully read through the config file to see whats possible or read through the plugins to see what possible commands are for each module."
QuakeLive,34td96,Siouxsie2011,3,Mon May 4 22:07:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah this is pretty bad for new players, if the only games up with players in will ban low skill players from joining I'd be more likely to just `quit than wait around in an empty server for people to join. But I'm assuming these guys with the bots are paying for pro subscription so they can spawn servers and let only good player in.   there should be an option when spawning a server to not send ""play now"" button clickers there for if people want to use bots like this, that would be good"
QuakeLive,34td96,ijnokmp,4,Mon May 4 13:23:25 2015 UTC,Thats why the devs need to get on board and do something positive and productive with the elo bots (recognising their relevance). These bots should not have been needed in the first place.
QuakeLive,34td96,ijnokmp,-1,Mon May 4 13:35:00 2015 UTC,"Well thats why I think minobot should not be allowed on public servers. If you want a private match, then have your match private."

QuakeLive,34td96,ijnokmp,1 point,Mon May 4 13:41:36 2015 UTC,"It's a problem, for sure. But you must recognise why high skilled players and server runners want these kind of controlled public servers (to attract casual play with only more proficient players). It's the games/QL-devs own fault that the servers are breaking apart in this way.  I know this, when QL goes steam only, there will be changes for some kind of match-making. We can only hope that by then, the devs find a way that helps rectify this issue. And produces something beneficial to both parties.  Players without a doubt should not be joining servers to find themselves insta-banned. It leaves a bitter taste."

Unfortunately you are feeling the main side effect :( which is a shame. I have had it a few times in the past, being banned when entering a server, it does feel cheap and dirty especially if no reason is given. You are left thinking.. wtf?  I dont play CA or Duel much, but I have noticed now the large array of servers with messages saying you must be 'this elo', which is obviously disastrous for new players who are completely unaware even what elo is. Duel seems to be a bit more friendly about it, most of the time you can jump on any server to just spectate.  This is an issue that the QL devs need to get involved with, because it is obvious the community wants and needs some kind of elo ranked and balanced servers. But they must make the game off-putting for many people who find themselves bouncing around between them.  I'd suggest, if you are in the EU, join some A&D, there is usually a filled server going in the evenings. if not, try the Team Combat mixed mode servers. Or you have to play ball with these bots and carefully filter out which CA server you can join."
QuakeLive,34td96,Talic_Zealot,1 point,Mon May 4 13:23:13 2015 UTC,"I have noticed now the large array of servers with messages saying you must be 'this elo', which is obviously disastrous for new players who are completely unaware even what elo is.     And I guarantee those people are low/mid skilled anyways who run/play on those servers.  Anytime I see CA servers with elo enforcement I chuckle.  Elo is only useful for ranking in duels(where it's not used at all) and only works best in best-of-3's between two players.  Winning/losing only one map shouldn't change someone's scoring, that makes zero sense.  Now think of one map changing a score in a game mode where there's random/non-picked teams without captains.    I don't quite get why people are so wrapped up in watching some number with their name attached change in some meaningless fashion in a casual/non-competitive game mode anyways.    /end rant"

QuakeLive,34td96,Nicker,1 point,Mon May 4 20:26:06 2015 UTC,"Please correct me if I'm wrong here, but my understanding of the minqlbot is that being banned from joining the server only happens to players that repeatedly quit midgame, and there's a warning against doing that.  Players with too few games (noobs or alts) and players with low elo are allowed to join the server, but if they try to join a team they get moved back to spectator along with a reason."
QuakeLive,34td96,trollsodus,1 point,Tue May 5 14:25:20 2015 UTC,"The problem is QL devs didn't deliver some functionality, and they had plenty of time since 2008. First the built-in Skill Rating shouldn't be hidden, and should be reliable at least like the qlranks ratings. Then there should be options in Create match to limit who can join the server. There is ""Skill Restriction"" option, but only ""Unrestricted / My skill level"", it should be exact elo / SR numbers. Then players would see the limits in server browser, not suitable servers could be filtered out.    I guess the minobot kick -> awaiting snapshot bug may be avoided by delaying the kick a few seconds (optionally the player to be banned may be instantly muted to prevent chat spam). Or maybe there's a way to check if player completed his connecting to the server."

You CAN comeback from disadvantage, you can deal damage over time and choose when to get aggressive and regain control.  Decision making and risk assessment are key.    You can hear an item being taken while remaining out of sight while it's picked up, might be a good idea to do this a few times until you can get over 100/100.  Rails are a good way to come back, damage can be dealt from a distance and immediately run away free.  Spamming grenades or rockets are good for restricting movement or getting an occasional low-damage hit.  Not idea to start a fight with but you have an idea of where someone is.

If you want a great example of how you can still win a game after an awful first spawn check out this video of Rapha in the world championship complete with his own play by play commentary. Just 15 seconds into the match he ends up absolutely crippled and Cooller has item control on all three items for over 6 minutes of the game. Rapha manages to minimize the damage and frags he lets up even in that situation and comes back to win the map.  Most streams follow the person who is winning a map. Try to find demos of good players when they're not winning and try to watch what they do when they don't have control. You want to try to keep timing on items so you can position to do damage, but also so you know where not to be.

QuakeLive,345cv2,bobwinters,1 point,Tue Apr 28 14:07:18 2015 UTC,"Thanks for replying. I'm based in Western Europe, some servers are from around here, many servers also are based in eastern Europe. So far I've found one server that's called ""open for all"", but even then there was a big fray about a low-skill player.  I'm playing on a 1080p 60hz monitor so there's certainly room for improvement, but it takes a while until I can invest hundreds into my gaming hardware again."
QuakeLive,345cv2,flowerbus,3,Wed Apr 29 07:33:32 2015 UTC,"QL desperately needs matchmaking. ID are planning on having one, hopefully it will be implemented by Quakecon in 3 months time, but don't hold your breath.  Stick at it, go into whatever servers that will let you in and practice, you will get better. Try playing for hours at a time every day for a few weeks, you will notice your skill level increasing quickly. Remember to have fun, so you don't want to quit!  Look at what mice/mousepads pros use and pick one that you like. Research your config to get the best settings that fits you. Start with a pros config that you like as a base, then modify it.  Look at the spectrum of mouse sensitivities/accel that pros use and make sure you are within that. The rule of thumb is, the lower your sensitivity, the better your aim is, but the worse your close combat skills are. This is a rule of thumb, it isn't always true.  144Hz probably isn't what's holding back your aim, Strenx uses 60hz and has one of the best lgs in the world."

Matchmaking would be great, knowing once its over you will be able to hop into one is cool.  The other modes barely need it, except for CA maybe"
QuakeLive,345cv2,gerdes88,1 point,Fri May 1 03:51:18 2015 UTC,I feel if you put high skill players from T3 and low skill players from T4 it's gonna work. (At least here in Europe.)
QuakeLive,345cv2,bobwinters,1 point,Wed May 6 16:40:14 2015 UTC,"Now this is really exciting news!  Also thanks for your advices. I do think that my mouse setup is on the high side of the spectrum, 4 sens and 0.4 acceleration. I just don't like swaying my whole arm to move my mouse. But I'm trying to lower sens now."
QuakeLive,345cv2,crazyal_,3,Wed Apr 29 07:36:58 2015 UTC,"Also, it can help to know how to abuse weaker players in certain situations in CA.  Knowing how to dance well (dodge) can help you die slower and do a lot more damage in situations where you'd die but also do 0 damage. (Especiall 1v2, which you should try to avoid, but can happen anyway.)  If someone is attacking you from the side and front, you can dodge the person in the front normally, but you can also move backwards forwards randomly to make the guy on your side miss. Sometimes, they don't expect this at all. It probably doesn't work vs T5 players though, since their aim is so good anyway.  Getting really good at the three main weapons, LG, RG rox is really important. I'm pretty good at LG (35 on a bad day, 45ish on good one, but only versus slightly weaker players than me), but bad at rockets/rail, so I've been working on using those a little more.  The nice thing about lg is that you can't totally whiff large chunks of damage unless someone jukes you bad. Use this to your advantege. You can lg someone from the a weird angle if he has rox out, then backup when he tries to retaliate. Dodging that first rocket can be so bad for the rocket user.  You mentioned CA duels. If you like that, you might like this channel. Descriptions often mention a lot of little combat tricks and little tips for getting better aim and dodge."
QuakeLive,345cv2,styves,2,Wed Apr 29 07:36:13 2015 UTC,Thanks a lot mate.
QuakeLive,345cv2,dk523,6,Wed Apr 29 19:13:48 2015 UTC,"CA is a simple mod. So instead of trying to get good at several advanced aspects, i would just focus on the simple things, and become an expert in those things. Examples on such is being a good team mate (2v1 always wins) and having superior combat skills (dodge, aim, position etc.).  on a side note, i would recommend playing duel. It is a hastle in the beginning, but once u get a feel for it, it is A LOT more entertaining. And FYI i played CA for almost a decade, only to have played duel for less than 2 years, and will never return."
QuakeLive,345cv2,thehappinessmachine,1 point,Thu Apr 30 14:17:26 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your feedback.    being a good team mate   Now I do feel like a noob for asking this, but: besides staying together and occasionally trying to flank the enemy, is there other team tactics for CA?"
QuakeLive,345cv2,SvenTreDosa,3,Tue Apr 28 18:14:22 2015 UTC,"Apart from the obvious 'stay with your team mates'. The most important (but also obvious) strategy in CA is to NEVER get into a battle where you are fighting 2 enemies at once, especially when 1 enemy is behind you. Avoiding this is actually much harder than it sounds, here's some tips I've found.   Do not take the 'get ready to fight 3,2,1' moment for granted, this is a very important time. What you need to do before the fighting starts is to get as much information as possible as to where all the enemy players are AND where they aren't. Knowing where they aren't is very important if you need to escape from a 2v1 battle or to move from a bad positioning. Knowing where they are means that in a 1v1 battle, you won't suddenly get a 2v1 battle from behind.   Getting this information may mean you need to quickly run across the map then back to the safety of a teammate. You need to LISTEN (very important) out for enemy players and visually look around corners because they may be walking/still.  This tip will also seem obvious if spend a second thinking about, but you need to know it by instincts without giving it any conscience thought. (Which is why you need to constantly practice). Running across the map is actually very useful for information gathering. Not just because of the information you can find from covering more area. But it means that any enemy chasing you, you will hear them because for them to keep up, they will also have to run, running makes noise, noise means you will know where they are. If you can't hear them following you, then it means you know they aren't there.   Keep an eye on your teammates. If they are fighting someone, you need to help them out! Not just to be a 'team player' (of course that's the point in CA) but also because if they are fighting 1v1, making it a 2v1 in your favour makes it a lot easier for you to hit damage.  Avoid getting hit by unreturned peek rail damage! Your hp is VERY important and you should be very frustrated at yourself if this happens. Always know where the zones that you can potentially get railed from. Avoid those zones, or if you need to be in those zones, only be there if you are railing back, or if you know they aren't in those railing spots."

QuakeLive,345cv2,roborob0,2,Wed Apr 29 15:00:49 2015 UTC,Stop caring so much. :)
QuakeLive,345cv2,JigglyWiggly_,2,Thu Apr 30 14:15:04 2015 UTC,"Bro, I wish I could, but there's a certain point where I start to care.  I don't care when I lose in general. I can duel someone losing 4 games in a row and it's still fun if the opponent is not like n-times better; lost two CA duels yesterday 5-10 and still enjoyed it. That's the magic of Quake.  But when other players start to pressure me to leave (let's be honest here, no one arriving in T4 is a noob, and noob is a derogatory term in our circle) and eventually kick me, that's where I start to care. Because I'm past 30, have jobs/study/family to manage, and when I find time to play computer games I'd like to have fun (again, not necessarily winning). Not frustration.  Ultimately, why keep playing if the system makes me play with people who do not want to let me play? I have other quality games in my backlog. The moment I stop caring would be the moment I quietly walk away from the game and go do something else. Which would make me sad."

QuakeLive,3424t9,siirna,6,Tue Apr 28 08:15:38 2015 UTC,I'd have to recommend watching Fazz over Zlive.  He streams 125fps cups and other things as well as high-level analysis of gameplay.  It's cool what Zoot and Shpuld do but it's basic ESPN-tier play by play casting. It's impossible to learn anything from hearing what goes on on screen being repeated and not at all enjoyable.
QuakeLive,3424t9,zoot89,7,Mon Apr 27 19:18:30 2015 UTC,"I think there is a difference between a game that is casted and a game that is analysed.  ZLive does game commentary, we are less qualified to provide deep analysis but we do have a team of extremely competent gamers.  Fazz is a top level player, he provides some level of analysis on the game but does not actively do commentary.  Really depends what you are after.  If you think everyone on ZLive provides little insight then I think that's an unfair judgement.  We know the scene extremely well, we know the players well and we know the game well."

It's that simple. :)  The game mode that gets the most media attention is duel. I.e. 1 vs 1. But the most popular is Clan Arena, where you play in teams. They play very differently. Try both and see which you like more. That said, quake live doesn't have a large competetive scene anymore. But it is still the largest fps game (I think). Even if it isn't it is definately the largest skill based fps. It's your skill that will determine if you win. Not how much you have paid for cool weapons or random gimmicks."
