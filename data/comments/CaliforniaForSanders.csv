CaliforniaForSanders,3dzxre,TaxExempt,10,Mon Jul 20 22:00:06 2015 UTC,I think Kamala is great and will be a worthy successor to Boxer.
CaliforniaForSanders,3dzxre,primitive_thisness,7,Tue Jul 21 00:22:15 2015 UTC,Do you think that she'll be a Sanders supporter? She seems more like a Clinton Democrat to me... along with Newsom.
CaliforniaForSanders,3dzxre,WaywardWit,3,Tue Jul 21 01:32:53 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I don't think we want Boxer's successor.  We need someone who will support almost everything Bernie/We needs done."
CaliforniaForSanders,3dzxre,ChangloriousBastard,7,Tue Jul 21 03:32:27 2015 UTC,"Kamala is a strong advocate of consumer rights, and has proven that as AG. She seems fairly popular with the unions, though her pro-worker views haven't really been tested. She may not necessarily be a Sanders-Democrat, but she could definitely be an Elizabeth Warren Democrat* which is okay with me.  *Warren is a major supporter of Kamala Harris, and they've had a strong relationship that dates back to before they were in their current offices. They have similar viewpoints on the role of government and the need for tougher and better enforced regulations on banks and other major economic players."
CaliforniaForSanders,3dzxre,WaywardWit,3,Tue Jul 21 03:45:51 2015 UTC,Warren has also been supportive of Hillary.. That doesn't tell me much about their positions.
CaliforniaForSanders,3dzxre,ChangloriousBastard,2,Tue Jul 21 13:45:31 2015 UTC,"That's a fair critique, but I don't think it fits in this case."
CaliforniaForSanders,3dzxre,primitive_thisness,3,Tue Jul 21 15:01:57 2015 UTC,Boxer's successor would be fine with me.  What I don't want is another DiFi when she leaves.
CaliforniaForSanders,3dzxre,WaywardWit,4,Tue Jul 21 07:18:00 2015 UTC,Can we ask Feinstein to retire instead of Boxer? I think that would be for the best.
CaliforniaForSanders,3dzxre,pastanazgul,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:46:16 2015 UTC,Why not both?
CaliforniaForSanders,3dzxre,remedialrob,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:55:02 2015 UTC,Ha. I was thinking the same thing when I saw the link on my front page.
CaliforniaForSanders,3dzxre,pastanazgul,2,Tue Jul 21 21:20:42 2015 UTC,Kamala is out for herself and nothing else.

CaliforniaForSanders,3dvvl5,hsfrey,2,Sun Jul 19 23:35:01 2015 UTC,"I can't speak to any specific locations of any Sanders campaign offices because I don't know of any in California (I don't think there are any), but I can tell you what campaign offices are for.   They serve as an office for administrative roles on the campaign. Fundraising, event planning, accounting/reporting, communications, etc. all require administrative work. Campaign offices give those paid positions a place to work. They serve as hubs for volunteers and other field staff. Usually there are rooms for phone banking, and most canvassing shifts start at a campaign office to get lists and do any training that is needed."
CaliforniaForSanders,3dvvl5,ChangloriousBastard,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:49:29 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the response.  I'm rather shocked to learn that Sanders has no ""boots on the ground"" (please excuse the militaristic cliche) in the State with the most electoral votes.  Hillary sure isn't ignoring all the democratic donors and voters here!"
CaliforniaForSanders,3dvvl5,ChangloriousBastard,2,Tue Jul 21 01:06:30 2015 UTC,"It's far too early for boots on the ground, considering the primary in California is 11 months away. It's far more important to spend money in New Hampshire and Iowa, as the results there are a lot more important at this stage in the game. If he doesn't win or come close in either of those states, California (or any other state, really) won't matter, as his campaign will be dead.  At this point in time it's all about recruiting volunteers, building a grassroots movement, and raising money. He can do that in California without making the investment to buy campaign offices and hiring field staff."
CaliforniaForSanders,3dvvl5,ChangloriousBastard,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:35:40 2015 UTC,"Why is it necessary to ""hire"" staff, or even get local volunteers?  With the internet, Skype, etc. a volunteer 2500 miles away can be almost as effective as one down the block.  One reason Obama beat Hillary was because of his aggressive use of the internet. I don't see Bernie doing that, and that worries me."
CaliforniaForSanders,3duv5x,thundertd11,9,Sun Jul 19 18:25:51 2015 UTC,"Qualcomm Stadium - Capacity: 71,294  This would be incredible, but at what kind of cost is that? Renting out an NFL football stadium cannot be cheap, but man would that turn heads. I love the idea. It would be incredible if we could start a fundraising campaign for this, anybody have decent contacts? Perhaps link this on /r/SandersForPresident as well."
CaliforniaForSanders,3duv5x,xKommandant,4,Sun Jul 19 18:30:14 2015 UTC,"There are more campaign events coming up in the fall, so there's not much time. I'd start by contacting the campaign and seeing how much interest they can generate to promote it.   Then contact Qualcomm here: http://www.sandiego.gov/qualcomm/rent/index.shtml  ...to see what their specifications, availability, and requirements are. You may have to raise a lot of funds for special insurance and fees.   Contact fundraisers and promoters and see if they're interested in donating their efforts to the cause.   Follow every suggestion they have to get as many people interested as possible, such as blanketing radio, local TV, social media, and live events with promotional material.   Let me know if I can do anything at all to help! I'm a little further north in LA."
CaliforniaForSanders,3duv5x,Lady_badcrumble,4,Sun Jul 19 19:49:48 2015 UTC,Interesting. Filling up Qualcomm is a big undertaking but I'm interested in whatever we can do to grow his support around our marginally conservative county.
CaliforniaForSanders,3duv5x,UserDrew,4,Mon Jul 20 03:41:59 2015 UTC,"Here in Irvine, the UCI Bren Center is pretty big, like 20,000(?). I'm sure that would fill up and be pretty affordable for their campaign. And its 1 hour from both LA and San Diego"
CaliforniaForSanders,3duv5x,Mikey2121,2,Mon Jul 20 17:05:57 2015 UTC,"I would definitely contact some colleges in the San Diego area, specifically democratic and political student clubs so they could advertise and rally on campus"
CaliforniaForSanders,3duv5x,creamedpeaches,2,Mon Jul 20 01:05:25 2015 UTC,"That's a lot of people. But I think with a concerted effort it is possible. With carpooling from all over SoCal and the Southwest, perhaps focusing on college campuses, I really think it's possible. That's a once in a lifetime event that I'm sure many people would not want to miss. I'm in San Diego and I'll bet there's enough support."
CaliforniaForSanders,3duv5x,PapayaPokPok,2,Mon Jul 20 05:19:14 2015 UTC,"What you NEED is to stop thinking about silly, expensive stunts and to start thinking about how Sanders is going to get the minority vote.   If he doesn't, he's screwed. Even if you fill every stadium and auditorium in California."
CaliforniaForSanders,3duv5x,mawnck,2,Mon Jul 20 21:54:23 2015 UTC,I want this
CaliforniaForSanders,3duv5x,marisapiere,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:43:49 2015 UTC,"It's not possible this early in the rally. By the time Sanders starts winning some primaries in early 2016 I think so, but at this time the biggest crowd he's drawn was 15,000. That's slightly more than a fifth of what we need to fill Qualcomm. By Nov or Dec maybe he might be getting close.  I think that doing regular tabling, canvasing, and other grassroots outreach is probably more effective at this point than try to organize some mega-rally. Leave that up to the campaign, they know what they're doing."
CaliforniaForSanders,3du9zr,Lady_badcrumble,2,Sun Jul 19 15:17:06 2015 UTC,I wish I could go. I can't afford the gas money for a trip like that...

Unfortunately we can only really handle the L.A. event, and there are people in San Francisco and Seattle wanting to put something together. That's the correct email, spread the word!"
CaliforniaForSanders,3dj2qy,primitive_thisness,3,Thu Jul 16 22:29:18 2015 UTC,I'm so glad this is happening. What a fantastic idea.  Only one question: how will the proceeds be donated? Will you have no door charge but instead ipads (or something) set up for each person to donate individually?
CaliforniaForSanders,3dj2qy,taygo0o,2,Thu Jul 16 19:38:14 2015 UTC,"Tickets for sale, hopefully 100% of the door goes to Bernie. This largely depends on the venue and what kind of fees they want to charge. Also a place set up the day of to donate more."
CaliforniaForSanders,3dj2qy,jazir5,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:52:05 2015 UTC,"I'm just not sure how that's done. Individuals are limited to donating $2,600 before the primary. The giant, tens of thousands of dollars-per-plate galas go to SuperPACs. Bernie doesn't want one of those. You might be thinking that a few of the organizing individuals could each donate the proceeds ($2,600 each), but I believe every contributor's information has to be taken down. Otherwise you could have, I don't know, a concert attended by a bunch of Iranians or something.  I don't mean to be a naysayer, and I'm truthfully under-informed to know exactly what to say and ask. Please do get in touch with the campaign before you do too much planning. The FEC is a stickler."
CaliforniaForSanders,3dj2qy,klafka,2,Thu Jul 16 21:36:34 2015 UTC,"The idea is to have each attendee buy a ticket (no more than $15) and that money goes directly to his campaign. I don't think most of the people attending will be billionaires donating that much to his campaign, and the point is that Bernie takes donations from small donors like you and I who give a few dollars here or there. And I'm not sure why Iranians attending a concert would be an issue."
CaliforniaForSanders,3dj2qy,balmergrl,2,Thu Jul 16 22:28:30 2015 UTC,"For the money to go directly to his campaign, I believe the campaign has to know whose $15 it is. So name and address and all that. This may be easier to do than I worry.  The Iranian comment was just because foreign citizens aren't allowed to contribute to Federal campaigns.  I'll leave it alone now--I may be overthinking things. When I worked on a campaign some years back, FEC filing requirements were ridiculous."
CaliforniaForSanders,3dfog2,TDcrisis,3,Wed Jul 15 22:17:00 2015 UTC,"Unless the Democrats decide they won't allow independents to participate. I don't know if they've done that before, but they could."
CaliforniaForSanders,3dfog2,RsonW,3,Thu Jul 16 06:02:40 2015 UTC,"This is a big concern.   They could,  and they might,  since Bernie has much more support among independents than Hillary does."

Because that was Obama's thing.  Also in this poster in particular the Outer Glow is a bit much.    EDIT: The best Bernie poster I've seen so far is this one.  Nice and simple both in terms of its message and design.

Traditionally the Dem Party has opened it's primaries to no-party-preference voters. As the SOS website also states: ""A political party must notify the Secretary of State's office whether or not they will allow no party preference voters to vote in their presidential primary election 135 days before the election.""  So we might have to wait a while to see if they'll allow NPP voters to take part. If Hillary wins the party endorsement at convention, then this might be a problem."

I also just found this at http://www.calvoter.org/voter/faq.html: ""Can I vote for a candidate that belongs to a different political party than the one I belong to? In a general election you can vote for any candidate of any party regardless of what party you are registered with or if you are regisetred with no party preference.     However, in a Presidential Primary election, voters registered with a political party can only choose among candidates for president who are registered with the same party (the same is true for party central committee elections). Independent voters (now called ""No Party Preference"" voters) may have the option of voting in the Presidential primaries of political parties that allow independents to participate; whether parties allow this can vary from election to election, but generally the Democratic Party allows independents to vote in its presidential primaries and the Republican Party does not.""     You're suggesting that the California Democratic Party might NOT allow no-party-preference voters to participate in the Democratic Primary if Hillary wins?  As a tactic to reduce the number of non-Hillary primary votes? If so, then wow -- does anyone know if this a tactic that's been used in the past?"
CaliforniaForSanders,3cc5ne,lebastss,1 point,Mon Jul 6 19:49:56 2015 UTC,"I think in light of the fact its up to the party, it would be safer to register Democrat. There is a good chance that the party, who is backing Hillary, might close it this year to shed off Bernie supporters"
CaliforniaForSanders,3cc5ne,Bagginzes,1 point,Mon Jul 6 19:59:43 2015 UTC,"Well, I think that is is within the realm of possibility, that if at the Dem Convention, Hillary is able to get the party endorsement, that party officials could take this route and not allow NPP voters to participate and make it a sure thing.   This has other ramifications however, and would not be an easy decision. There are a lot of down-ticket races that depend on the split of NPP voters to bring elections home for the Dem party. We've noticed in CA that NPP basically just splits 50/50 when they vote, so if you lock out that vote, you could lose some purple districts by silencing those voters in primaries.   I don't know of it happening in the past, it probably hasn't since we've moved to open and top-2 primaries in CA. I think the safest bet for anyone that wants to cast a vote for Bernie is to swallow the same bite he did, and register the Dem party and make sure you're heard at the polls and endorsement meetings at county central committee meetings."
CaliforniaForSanders,3cc5ne,ChangloriousBastard,3,Mon Jul 6 20:13:11 2015 UTC,We've noticed in CA that NPP basically just splits 50/50 when they vote   That's not accurate at all.

CaliforniaForSanders,3cc5ne,ChangloriousBastard,2,Wed Jul 8 21:22:01 2015 UTC,"We've probably been to the same talks, and never once did I leave a Scott Lay or Paul Mitchell talk thinking that NPPs vote 50/50.    Look at this analysis from the PPIC: http://www.ppic.org/main/publication_show.asp?i=784  Of Note:   Independents hold unfavorable opinions of major parties but support Democrats in elections. Most independent likely voters have unfavorable views of the Democratic Party (59%), the Republican Party (73%), and the Tea Party movement (59%). Leading up to the 2014 gubernatorial election, independents prefer Jerry Brown, the Democrat, to Neel Kashkari, the Republican (52% to 28%).   I can't speak for everyone, but most of the modeling we do anticipates the NPP vote breaking very similar to the partisan vote turnout.  In districts with high Democratic registration the NPPs tend to skew Democrat.  In districts with high Republican registration the NPPs tend to skew Republican."

CaliforniaForSanders,3cc5ne,ChangloriousBastard,5,Thu Jul 9 00:05:48 2015 UTC,I really doubt she'll win the endorsement at convention.  It requires a 2/3rds vote and there are a lot of non-Hillary supporters in the state committee.
CaliforniaForSanders,3cc5ne,raise-the-avanc,2,Tue Jul 7 02:08:55 2015 UTC,"The CA primary is less than 135 days after the first primary, so the party could not make the decision to allow or disallow NPP voters into our primaries after seeing how Bernie is faring in other states.  If it ends up being a close race and our electoral votes matter much, though, they very well could change the rules for the next election."
CaliforniaForSanders,3cc5ne,Bagginzes,2,Tue Jul 7 19:57:01 2015 UTC,"Right, we should know by Jan 23rd 2016 whether or not NPP can take part in the Dem primary, and the first round of primaries and caucuses aren't until Feb (as of info based on June 2015).

In a general election you can vote for any candidate of any party regardless of what party you are registered with or if you are regisetred with no party preference.  California's voters enacted the ""Top Two Open Primary"" system in June 2010. Under these rules, all voters, whether registered with a party or not, are allowed to vote for any Primary candidate of any party in statewide, congressional and legislative contests. In these contests, the top two vote-getters will proceed to the General Election, even if they are of the same party. Click here for more information from the Secretrary of State.  However, in a Presidential Primary election, voters registered with a political party can only choose among candidates for president who are registered with the same party (the same is true for party central committee elections). Independent voters (now called ""No Party Preference"" voters) may have the option of voting in the Presidential primaries of political parties that allow independents to participate; whether parties allow this can vary from election to election, but generally the Democratic Party allows independents to vote in its presidential primaries and the Republican Party does not."""

Traditionally, the Dem party has allowed no-party-preference voters to take part in the Dem Primary. If there's some shenanigans however, the party may not allow it this time around to shore things up for Hillary. So we'll have to wait and see to make sure they allow NPP from voting in the Dem Primary.  Also, it's very important to note, ""Independent"" party selection isn't what everyone thinks--it's an actual separate party just like the Dems and Reps. That isn't the same as No-Party-Preference. So you'll have to switch to either NPP/decline to state and hope the Dems let you vote in the primary, OR, the safest best is to just register as a Dem for 2016."

Message the admin for more info or for access. We're organizing clubs on each campus and are receiving help from a campaign staffer.   I think it would be great if you could start up your own club on campus. Perhaps you can create a Bay Area for Bernie facebook group afterwards and organizing meetings for your city. There was a recent meeting in San Diego and way more people than expected showed up and I believe we'll start doing things soon such as going door to door, etc.   If you'd like to receive more info on how to do something like this, join our group and someone who organized it could probably help you out. https://www.facebook.com/groups/SanDiegoforBernieSanders2016/"

Also just to be clear in the state of CA Independent is a political party, and to be a non party-affiliated voter you have to actually specify Decline to state or no preference.

We've seen the GOP primary votes be tossed out.  They're not legally binding because there's now laws governming how a party picks a candidate.  You can have 100% of the DNC supporting sanders and then they can still just pick Hillary.    It's a shitty game.

CaliforniaForSanders,34ue1u,delphinum,1 point,Tue May 5 05:43:09 2015 UTC,"I'll work on an email, too.  Sam Farr is awesome, and he I've gotten a few letters from him personally responding to my emails, even sometimes when they were form letters.  Here's an update he put on facebook the other day:   Today I voted against the USA Freedom Act. Congress may have changed the name but the bill is just a watered down version of the Patriot Act. I commend the bipartisan effort to adhere to the 2nd Circuit Court’s ruling and to develop more safeguards. Unfortunately, it still contains too many provisions that threaten the civil liberties of American citizens.  Just as I have every time the Patriot Act has been up for a vote, I opposed this bill because it doesn't protect our privacy rights enshrined in the 4th Amendment. The risk of faulty information collection is not a risk I am willing to take with any American’s privacy. Upholding the Constitution is non-negotiable."

CaliforniaForSanders,34pe80,delphinum,2,Sun May 3 09:51:56 2015 UTC,Good idea
CaliforniaForSanders,34p8ho,benms2747,2,Sun May 3 07:57:44 2015 UTC,"Hey there, I went through the CA DMV to see what they recommend to register your vote and it's the same site that you used.   So I think it probably just takes time to update (government agencies are sloooooow). If it doesn't update in the next couple of days (maybe give it at least 5 business days) it may actually be interesting that it takes so long. Because I would worry about people registering late, like 1 or 2 days before the primaries, and not being able to vote in their preferred parties race.   Edit: Please keep us posted because this could be interesting!"
CaliforniaForSanders,34p8ho,NotaNovetlyAccount,2,Sun May 3 20:53:12 2015 UTC,Thanks for the info! I'll put an update in a week or 2 to allow time for changes to go through.
CaliforniaForSanders,34p8ho,NotaNovetlyAccount,2,Sun May 3 21:25:07 2015 UTC,Hey just giving you an update to let you know I checked today and my party preference was changed to Democratic.
CaliforniaForSanders,34p8ho,delphinum,2,Thu May 7 04:06:56 2015 UTC,OP delivered :p that's awesome!! Okay it's good to know that it updates in about 5 business days.
