Adelaide,3e58oe,heyitsmeshaz,5,Wed Jul 22 01:33:58 2015 UTC,"If she's screaming at her kids nonstop from 7am, that's pretty indicative of emotional abuse. I'd file an anonymous report to the child abuse hotline.  I know this sounds vindictive, but I'm legitimately concerned if it's happening as you describe. I'm a mandated reporter."
Adelaide,3e58oe,Urytion,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:28:55 2015 UTC,"I've actually thought of this. It is pretty bad. As a child who went through DV, the situation next door worries me. At the very least the kids are going to be emotionally f'd up like I was. They are going to have no self worth, all they hear is yelling... :/ If I was to report something how would I go about it? There was one incident I nearly rang the cops for."
Adelaide,3e58oe,Urytion,1 point,Wed Jul 22 09:05:13 2015 UTC,"You ring up, you give them all the information you can. Direct quotes and times are good. If you can hear the kids' reaction, describe that too. Frequency and patterns are what people look for. You can remain anonymous if you choose. Give their address, and names if you can. Most importantly, make sure the hotline knows whether or not the children are safe and healthy. If the kids are in immediate physical danger, they have to know.  Also worth noting, there is nothing wrong with giving your suspicions. Direct information is great, but if you suspect they're being abused or neglected in other ways, tell the hotline."
Adelaide,3e58oe,pmam,5,Wed Jul 22 10:19:06 2015 UTC,"I've had noisy neighbours who appeared to suffer from emotional abuse. Believe it or not, asking them to quieten things down actually worked.  Assuming you are a tenant, in order I'd:   ask the neighbour to moderate her volume; ask the landlord if they can do anything about it; tell the landlord that if the situation can't be resolved in some reasonable period you'll be forced to quit the lease as it is impossible to remain there.   TL; DR - if all else fails make it the landlord's problem. They've got an economic incentive to help you."
Adelaide,3e58oe,Veganpuncher,2,Wed Jul 22 02:36:48 2015 UTC,"This is the best reply so far.  Disclaimer: I am not a lawyer.  Nonetheless, I have learnt that familiarity with the law can resolve a lot of problems (mostly because it shuts bullying lawyers up, and intimidates those who are not familiar with it.)  You are in a situation which is causing you discomfort and hardship, but which you are, effectively, powerless to alleviate. The key is to find the right lever to pull to relieve the situation. /u/pmam is (mostly) correct. In this order:   Talk to the neighbour quietly and logically - do not get into an argument - just state your case and make sure that you write down what was said afterwards (don't film or tape it, this will just aggravate things); Go to a doctor to explain the effects of this situation - get a medical certificate stating that you are being medically adversely affected by your neighbour's behaviour. Do this even if she shuts up, I doubt any relief will be permanent; Write a letter to the Strata Corp including a copy of your med cert and the transcript of your conversation with your neighbour. Explain that, as you are the offended party, and they are responsible for the peaceable running of the complex, you will have no option but to involve them in any legal proceedings resulting from the situation. CC your lawyer, if you have one. Make sure you insist on a response by a given date (2 weeks is fair).   I disagree with /u/pmam's last point, you should not have to move, you are the aggrieved party, not the instigator.  You do not want to get the courts involved if you can avoid it, but you must, at all stages, look as if you are willing and able to do so. Keep meticulous records, obey the law, remain calm and know your rights.  This should be the basis of all your actions: http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/sa/consol_act/rta1995207/s65.html  See s.1(c), and s.2. Make sure you quote it in all correspondence.  Let me know if I can be of further assistance."
Adelaide,3e58oe,Dimbit,4,Wed Jul 22 04:39:42 2015 UTC,"If the yelling sounds abusive at all you can report her to FSA.  You could go visit and offer to watch the kids,  maybe she's just stressed and needs a break."

Adelaide,3e58oe,Tom555,3,Wed Jul 22 08:39:20 2015 UTC,If you are as passive as you say it might be best to play the pity card. At the end of the day she is probably just a normal person who is at the end of her shit taking meter everyday. Say that in addition to your working hours you have sleep issues and you have tried numerous methods before coming to meet her. Just simply ask that she try to stay a little bit quieter. Remember to keep you tone in check so it doesn't sound like you're criticising her as a person.   If she decides to be bitch after that wellll thats what the cops are for.
Adelaide,3e58oe,Stigface,3,Wed Jul 22 02:00:35 2015 UTC,"I'd suggest a quiet word in passing is better than an anonymous letter. Most people are reasonable and will understand, especially if you're doing night shifts."
Adelaide,3e58oe,hydr0xide,3,Wed Jul 22 01:56:05 2015 UTC,"Suck it up and try and have a friendly, polite and non-aggressive chat. Explain that you work nights and you'd be very appreciative if they could make an effort to keep it down in the mornings.  If she reacts like a spoiled brat/bogan (""F you, you can't tell me what to do, blah blah blah""), then start wearing earplugs, or just move. Cops can't do anything about it because it probably isn't exceeding any noise ordinances. You will never win with people like that. More likely than not the situation would just escalate. If they are renters, you could try having a chat with the landlord, but unlikely that they would care. You could also try telling your landlord, but they probably won't have many options either."
Adelaide,3e58oe,shakaspeare,2,Wed Jul 22 02:15:02 2015 UTC,"I'm similar to you in not liking confrontation, however if it's gotten to the point you can't put up with it I think a face to face friendly discussion is better than a letter. I'd stop by her place when there's a break in screaming (no point catching her when she's at maximum rage) and say something positive like ""Your kids are really well behaived"" and go into your issue ""but the walls are thin and I can hear a lot of the loud vocals"". Try to avoid using the word 'screaming' as she might use it as an opportunity to justify herself or take it as an attack on her character. If you can afford it, give her a small present to butter her up (e.g. a pack of scones with jam) and force some cognitive dissonance (It's hard to be pissed at someone while they're doing something nice for us).  Ultimately, remember that even if she freaks out at you, it doesn't mean it's a loss, it might mean she just has to stew on it for a few days.  I had a neighbour that had a dog (a Pomeranian) that was yapping non stop and it would begin its tirade if I made any sound in my kitchen even like putting a spoon in the sink. I went over and very softly said ""Hi, I'm your neighbour from next store. I can't help but notice that your dog seems to bark quite a lot and I wondered whether...."" and she just stopped me mid-sentence and told me ""Dogs bark, I can't do anything about it"". I was like ""oh, um, okay..."" and walked off, feeling like I was an asshole. Anyway the next day, the barking improved by about 50-60% so she did something. Then a month later their house got knocked down. That'll teach the fuckers."

However if I want a nice meal with friends then I'll still go to a proper restaurant where I can have a beer or a wine and actually sit in a chair.

Having said that, when I did it, there was a pool of maybe 100 or so people for the month. You were allotted into one of five groups and then cycled through the different cases. Some days there was nothing, other days you got called in. I sat two trials in the 30 days and they were only two or three days each. It was interesting."
Adelaide,3e1wd2,Cosmicmonkii,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:48:07 2015 UTC,They pick a pool of 3000-4000 people each year that they then select from each month. With a population of 1.2m adults your chances of being pooled for selection are ~0.3%. You won't actually know if you've even been pooled unless you are selected. No idea what the monthly selection rates are.  I guess if you know 300 people chances are one of them will be picked each year
Adelaide,3e1wd2,basefield,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:17:30 2015 UTC,"Got called up last year, sat a few cases. Very disruptive and inefficient system. Nothing starts til 10AM and if its a new case, you have less than a 50/50 chance of actually sitting as a juror. So some days it hits 11AM and you are not required. Everything wraps up at 4PM too. They cover up to $150 of wages and a few cents per KM of travel. So if you can prove that you earn over $150 a day and jury duty would cause you financial loss, its the easiest way of getting out of it. Common for tradies & sole business owners to get out of it due to this reason. They might not take home $150 per day, but its $150 prior to expenses."

Most days you got called up, sat there for a couple of hours, got told to have lunch and come back, then get sent home around 3pm when there's nothing new starting.

Adelaide,3e1wd2,UnicornPenguinCat,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:17:26 2015 UTC,"A friend at work was summoned for jury duty for quite some time. We knew it was something interesting/juicy and we tried to figure out what case it was she was on by the process of elimination.   We only work around the corner from the courthouse and pondered following her back and see if there was any media about, but we just couldn't be arsed."
Adelaide,3e1wd2,Cleops,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:32:04 2015 UTC,"I got summoned for jury duty a few years ago. Our group/jury was given a trial that day, but when it started it turned out to be pretty full on and one of the jurors got freaked out and passed a note saying that they couldn't sit through it. The trial was adjourned and we basically had to wait until we got assigned a new one, took a few days I think. The second one was went on for about a week and I actually kinda enjoyed it.    They pay you too. If you can show them you're missing out on work/pay they'll give you x amount per day, up to about $150. I worked nights so I only got $20 per day but it was still enough to cop some trainers after it was over. Which was nice."
Adelaide,3e1wd2,g-swift,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:19:09 2015 UTC,When a guy at my work did it for a few weeks he got his normal pay from the company and they claimed it back from the government. He got full pay.
Adelaide,3e1wd2,twisted_by_design,0,Wed Jul 22 00:59:21 2015 UTC,"I didn't think jury duty here was a thing until my friend was summonsed for it - I assumed it was an American trope. From what I recall about my friend's experience, I think she was allocated to serve for a month, and was a juror for three cases. Not sure about the frequency of that kind of stuff though, sorry - all I can say is that we definitely do have jury duty here, I guess."

Adelaide,3e1wd2,hellboy1975,0,Tue Jul 21 11:47:29 2015 UTC,My friend was on Jury duty for week or so on one trial. I used to work in the city at that time and I would catch up for lunch with him and two other jurors when they were on break.

Adelaide,3e0fd2,Fartmatic,9,Tue Jul 21 13:47:16 2015 UTC,"Does anyone remember the Special Effects exhibition they had on once? It would have been around 15 years ago. You could buy a blank video tape and insert it into machines in front of green screens. Then you would stand in front of a camera and act out various scenes from space flight to climbing mountains/volcanoes, sinking on the titanic. They had these miniature models with cameras automated to fly around them and then they would apply them to the green screen backgrounds behind us.  It opened my eyes to the potential of film making and inspired me to learn how to make films. Kids need that kind of place to visit in the holidays."

Adelaide,3dxgej,Koonga,5,Mon Jul 20 09:51:42 2015 UTC,"Yup, went there last Wednesday for lunch. incredibly average food in my opinion. Me and another friend paid $74 in total for our bill which only consisted of 2 mains ($34 each) and a drink. Pretty expensive considering it only is lunch.  In terms of camera, they recorded us while we were waiting outside and also inside while we were eating. They'll tell you not to look into the camera for whatever purposes.While we were outside they asked us how we were and what we were expecting from it. Sometimes they'll tell you what to say. Inside, they just take shots of us from wherever the cameraman is standing. They move quite a bit but don't intrude your personal bubble. After you eat their food you can go into the feedback room where there's a touchscreen and a camera. You fill out your details and you look into the camera and give them feedback for a minute. Other than that, nothing too special. It is quite spacious inside as well although it's made out of shipping containers."
Adelaide,3dxgej,Gueze,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:13:46 2015 UTC,hmm yeah thats more expensive than i was expecting. I would have assumed it would be relatively cheap given it's for a tv show and doesn't really need to make money. Plus you're essentially doing work for channel 7 by being filmed.   Do you have to do the 1 minute feedback thing or can you just fill out a card and walk out?
Adelaide,3dxgej,Gueze,2,Mon Jul 20 12:37:58 2015 UTC,Not sure if there is a card that you can fill out but the feedback room is optional so you can walk out of the restaurant without having to critique them.

If it is, great result.  If not, I want to see that figure to compare roi.  In my job I never get to count already realised benefit in proposals for new projects.  I am however glad it got built, even if it's cost us a fortune. But I also want to make sure the picture being painted stacks up."

Adelaide,3dvvmc,Xperian,3,Mon Jul 20 08:01:01 2015 UTC,"As someone that has been in a lot of airports in Australia and internationally, I love Adelaide airport. There are few nicer airports around, particularly ones of a smaller size like ours. It's modern, sleek, clean and efficient.   One definite downside is the food though. Portland airport is of a similar size and the food options there are incredible."
Adelaide,3dvvmc,Denial23,1 point,Mon Jul 20 08:44:41 2015 UTC,"The next ten years of airport development look really good actually. I think that'll probably fix the food problem an extent.

Adelaide,3dvvmc,pqu,2,Mon Jul 20 08:41:42 2015 UTC,Well of course the Oval Stadium Management Authority want to justify their own salaries. What is more germane is how much more the new oval buildings have contributed than the previous setup? And what is the ROI on the half a billion that it cost.
Adelaide,3dvvmc,Fromage4moi,5,Sun Jul 19 23:43:58 2015 UTC,Well for one thing  attendances have skyrocketed.
Adelaide,3dvvmc,S4mmyK,3,Mon Jul 20 00:27:42 2015 UTC,Exactly that. I've actually been to the footy at the new location because I don't have to find a park in a random suburb and walk for 20 minutes.
Adelaide,3dvvmc,PhotographsWithFilm,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:51:32 2015 UTC,"OK, here is the question.  So, you now go to the footy as it is more accessible  to you.  But, is this new spending for you?  Or is it a case of “OK, I’ll spend less at the local Pub/Café/Restaurant so I can go to the footy instead”?"
Adelaide,3dvvmc,S4mmyK,6,Mon Jul 20 02:13:05 2015 UTC,"it's two seperate things for me, i'd still get me coffee and breakfast at the local near my house and then go to the footy that evening. i don't substitute one over the other."
Adelaide,3dvvmc,PhotographsWithFilm,-1,Mon Jul 20 02:17:05 2015 UTC,"So, going to the footy is new spending - spending money that you wouldn't have necessarily spent before?  In that aspect, it has worked.  But I am not sure it would be the same for everyone.  There would be plenty of people that would be sacrificing something else so they could now go to the footy in the city."
Adelaide,3dvvmc,Mallakyte,9,Mon Jul 20 02:21:20 2015 UTC,"But that's the same for everything... I can afford a house with these low interest rates, but it means I won't buy the car I was saving for. I want to buy that new TV but instead I bought a coffee machine because it was on sale. There will always be people in both buckets - some who distribute the spend, some who spend instead of save. What's being spent in here is almost entirely goods and services provided by South Australians. If instead of buying a TV made in China I attend the footy staffed by 1000 SA'ies, drink 4 Coopers,  then go to a restaurant staffed by 30 SA'ies, and drink a bottle of Church Block, before catching the train home... What possible better way is there for me to spend my money? Your argument that it's not 'New Spend' for everyone is dramatically understating the good for the local economy."

Adelaide,3dvb05,Cure4thitch,2,Sun Jul 19 23:38:06 2015 UTC,Which line do you mean? So many at a con.  I got to the city about 9:30am and I was buying tickets. We got in about 10:30am-ish (at a guess). Was worth it as last time we were in line to get in about 2 hours arriving around 11am. It was funny how you had to go up stairs then down stairs again to join the back of the line to get in. Next year there should be no renovations so the main entrance will be used again - so much better there.  The line to get in for After Dark was very long. Then we had to evacuate and line up again at 9pm so they could boot all the underagers out. I felt sorry for anyone in line for the bar at 9 as the line for the bar stretched across the room for the first 2-3 hours. I was buying 3-4 drinks at a time to make up for it.

Highlights for me were the speedruns, cosplays and that game in the corner of the indie game section where you had to milk the cats. That was absolutely hilarious. Only disappointment was that I didn't make it into the CS:GO tournament due to the high number of entrants, but oh well, it happens.  This was the first year I've been to AVCon, and while I enjoyed it, I think I may have enjoyed it even more if I was in cosplay myself. I'll just have to consider that for next year!"

From memory the memberships are renewed in around December, and presumably those in the waiting lists get offers as well.  In the off chance there are any left over, then I guess they'd go on sale around about then.  General Admission membership isn't sold out (for now), so you can buy that any time.  3-match passes are readily available as well.  tl;dr you'll want to get on a waiting list ASAP if you want any chance of a seated membership in 2016."

A group of women making lots of cash money in an illegal activity are going to need protection from organised crims. So, to whom to they turn for protection? More organised crims. I'm not an expert, but it seems logical.  On the other hand, it is possible that they had no protection, and this is just a friendly 'heads up' from the group that they said no to."

Could have sections for food, like best Breakfasts in Adelaide divided up in to cheap / expensive. Best lunch / dinners in Adelaide, cheap / expensive. Best stuff out North / South / West / East.   Then sections on things to do - activities divided up in to all ages or adult. Indoors, outdoors.  Have a section with some good ideas for long weekends - camping trips for example with a quick list of distance from the CBD and any costs / necessities.   Maybe a rough calendar of the bigger events in the year - stuff like Fringe, OzAsia, etc so people can quickly check if they're visiting, then have a link to weekend notes and whatnot for more specific stuff. Also FB page links to events like Fork on the Road.  I'd be happy to get it started at least. Wouldn't be able to fill out every section but we could get the framework down and have people contribute. And I think disclosure is important (e.g. if you're going to add a restaurant to the list and you work there or your mate runs it or something, just say so. I think people are happy to support other redditors' etc but best to make it clear anyway).  Could be my parting gift to /r/adelaide... might be moving shortly :("

Adelaide,3dowpy,mobilebeta,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:47:50 2015 UTC,"You are referring to the books of Leviticus and Deuteronomy and other books of the Torah that contain the most savage laws in the Christian bible... those laws differ greatly because they have only ever applied to the ancient Levites who chose to be held to a ""higher moral standard"". These laws have never applied to Christians.  Additionally, almost all Christian denominations, including Catholicism, agree that those laws were part of the Old Covenant and were rendered invalid and inapplicable by Jesus' death.  Sure, Christians still refer to the laws in the Torah, however they do so only for insight to god's morality because the laws are invalid for several reasons.   This differs greatly from the laws in the Quran and the Sunnah and Muhammad's moral example, which are claimed by Islam to be valid and and forever.  Don't get me wrong, I'm not a Christian and I believe the Christian god is disgusting, however I also see no reason to lie about religious theology.  So you see, the difference between modern Christianity and modern Islam is the former makes claims about morality for which there are no earthly consequences, whereas Islam claims it is good to murder innocent people for Allah (innocence based on the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, not the Islamic book of violence and flying horses).  This isn't rocket science... almost every Islamic scholar and Imam agree that Islam promotes human rights violations against innocent people... and that's just within the scope of homosexuality and before we discuss the savage punishments for free speech and religious freedom and how pedophilia and rape and domestic violence ARE permissible in Islam."

Most people are perfectly civil and live a life just like you. They have a family, a job, and want to get on with doing the best they can.   Does Islam have an ugly side that can manifest? Sure, just like any other ideology (Australia has a fair few strikes against universal human rights these days).   To say that everyone following it is against human rights is just a numpty thing to say.   For the record I'm a hardcore atheist and would rather we ditched all these kooky religious ideas, but you're misrepresenting a whole group of people (certainly doesn't belong bundled with nazi and KKK)."

I was warned by the librarian (local council library) at the time that it was a pretty dark read. I was well under 18.   It's not brilliant storytelling, and yes, it's quite dark in places. It's served its purpose as another story told, another perspective to contemplate.   I entirely fail to see what cause anyone has to request that a bundled stack of papers and printed words be removed from public sale.

Except, that's not what happened. It was a plain clothed AFP officer, who merely said words to the effect of ""That book's classification requires it to be wrapped in plastic.""  SAPOL had nothing to do with this. The AFP have jurisdiction of film classification and copyright. They don't choose what the classifications are, but they are responsible for enforcement.  As much as you'd like to beat this up to some sort of Police State story, the AFP can't decide to simply ignore a report of an offence. I think they dealt with it entirely appropriately."

Adelaide,3dlgkr,touring123,1 point,Fri Jul 17 10:28:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah I hear you. What they're doing isn't really unique - I made a point when I talked to them that anyone can buy 7 to 14 gopros or whatever and basically make a 360 video. And with Youtube supporting it natively now, they're going to blow up. Basically like drones did.  I guess these guys set themselves apart doing special projects and being a bit ahead - they're a small team but have a decent amount dedicated to production so the quality is a step above the amateur stuff.  Their original business was doing 3D modelling, animations, flythroughs etc of infrastructure and build projects and they've worked that tech in as well. And they have those contacts so, in fact, most of their VR stuff isn't experiential like the ASO thing- it's site visits or visualisations for businesses. Which I imagine is where the money would be.  They also showed me a demo they did for Port / Crows, running out through the big flag thing with the players. I have 0 interest in football but it was really cool. Fireworks going off, running out with the crowd cheering, it was really neat to experience that.   So I think these guys acknowledge the fact that anyone can make a rig themselves or make a little investment and buy one - but it's the content you make and access you have that sets it apart."

Adelaide,3dktdg,hydr0xide,3,Fri Jul 17 02:19:37 2015 UTC,Yeah. The nature of these large scale projects is that lay-offs will occur. Just has to.

Adelaide,3dktdg,skunkops,7,Fri Jul 17 03:46:15 2015 UTC,"Although I agree that this is bad news for ASC and its employees, it still shits me to tears that the government (fed and state) and indeed some SA residents are 100% focused on job creation/job security/jobs in general, and getting people ""off the welfare"".  We live in a global economy run on greed capitalism. Jobs will be outsourced or automated, sooner rather than later, there is no stopping it. So rather than handing out $20'000 to Joe Blow to prop up his shitty coffee shop, maybe the government needs to have a long hard look at how it looks after its people. To make it clear, welfare should not be treated as some scourge on society, it should be used as a basic income so people can work not to live, but because they want to."

It was the worst choice for the 3 options we had to build these ships. I was meant to be on Hobart 18months ago, and now have lost the chance to be a crew member on these ships.... A lot of people are to blame (Navy, Governments (labour and liberal), DMO, ASC, Unions and more). Everyone has tried to extract every little slither of opportunity from these ships for their own benefits.. with the result being atrocious. The slowest ships builders in the world were the indians until this project came along. We could've bought 5 of these for the price of 3, and had them all here by next year.  Everyone is to blame. No-one is innocent. Meanwhile tired ships are awaiting replacement.   It's everybody's fault if ASC never gets anymore contracts, and under the current business, it never should."
Adelaide,3dktdg,jigsaw153,-4,Fri Jul 17 08:54:17 2015 UTC,The Labor government during Rudd-Gillard years didn't order anything for 7 years. It's absolutely ridiculous to blame this on the current Lib government. These projects take years to get approved and then for work to begin. This valley of death was coming whether the subs are built in Adelaide or not. The work is YEARS away from fruition.   Libs now need to commit to new work for the ASC going forward even if it takes years for that work to be started. The certainty will help going forward.
Adelaide,3dktdg,thinkcupcake,-4,Fri Jul 17 02:25:04 2015 UTC,"But of course as per usual (as I can already see with the comments on the articles around the web), Adelaideans live in an echo chamber and will blame this all on TA and the Libs.

Adelaide,3dkt4m,Brokenmonalisa,-2,Fri Jul 17 19:04:02 2015 UTC,"a cultural shift is needed.  off the top of my head, these would dramatically improve rail service quality:  1. bulldoze 50% of the stations. so many stations so close together is a hang up of the pre-automobile era. remove the lowest 50% stations used. 2. less stations = quicker travel times. Imagine if the Gawler line was 6 stops from city to gawler? 3. increase the speeds. You need to make trains the fastest transport medium. I could drive from Seaford or Elizabeth to the city and get there before the train does. 4. grade separation. start this now. 5. Halve the volume of buses into the city/make them feed the railway network. because of the medieval rail strategy in use, there are more buses ferrying passengers into the city along known rail areas (Nth Suburbs for example). You dont need 4-5 bus routes from Elizabeth to the City next to a train line. Make them route people to stations. Sydney and Melbourne have less bus routes going to the city than Adelaide does.  Have a look at the Perth Rail network... it's a city bigger than adelaide, but there rail network is slightly bigger... see how revolutionary it is for a city of it's size. Look at the Mandurah Line, and see what a long distance metro line with less stops achieves. this is how 21st century railways need to be."
Adelaide,3dkt4m,jigsaw153,-3,Fri Jul 17 09:04:51 2015 UTC,"Gawler line you could remove a few stations and service a few less. You could remove - North Adelaide, Dudley Park, Kilburn, Greenfield, Parafield Gardens, Chidda, Nurlutta, Elizabeth South, Broadmeadows, Gawler Oval.  Stations like Womma are in a good spot for feeding buses and Kudla could be the centre on a new housing development. That Would make it 15 stations over 42km, rather then the 25 now."
Adelaide,3dkt4m,torrens86,-2,Fri Jul 17 09:39:35 2015 UTC,The Seaford line needs more stations removed or amalgamated then the Gawler line.  The Belair lines issues are due to it being single track.

Adelaide,3dktat,hydr0xide,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:23:11 2015 UTC,"The real problem is that SA has been a Federal Government experiment for the past seventy years, and now the Feds have pulled the plug. Adelaide was set up as a hub for small agricultural and mining enterprises, and it should have stayed that way. The Federal Government set up Elizabeth and Salisbury to absorb the ten-pound poms emigrating after WWII. In order to give them something to do, the Feds have subsidised the motor vehicle, Defence, and shipbuilding industries in SA since then. Now they've pulled the plug and the State is looking for something to do with all these spare people.  SA has no natural advantages (except the industry that dare not speak its name), is miles from any trade routes or industrial/scientific centres, and has managed to completely mismanage the mining boom so that all the State really got out of it is a bunch of holes in the ground.  So, all the smart people are moving to where smart people get well paid, the State Government spent the entire mining boom arguing over how to manage it, and we have no secondary industry, no primary industry on a competitive scale, and all we're left with is basic wage baristas selling lattes to lycra-clad cyclists once a year, and beer to bogans in March.  On the bright side, there are two viable industries: The Retirement industry (cheap property and lots of unemployed people to train as carers); and the industry which dare not speak its name.

Add to this the fact that you're generally dealing with low-intelligence, low-SE persons who simply don't know any better, and it's a very difficult situation.  Ultimately, however, children are pretty much psychologically 'formed' by the time they're four or five. So the whole rimarole is essentially pointless. You can't 'save' a seven year old. They're already stuffed by that age.  The well of human misery is so deep as to be unfathomable.

Adelaide,3dcuat,Hastys,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:59:23 2015 UTC,"This is precisely the problem I'm talking about - it's absurd that if you sometimes do very short trips and sometimes do longer trips you have to maintain two separate cards with separate balances, and you have to know which journeys you're permitted to use the 2 section card on.

Adelaide,3dcuat,thinkcupcake,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:08:04 2015 UTC,"Ah I don't find it too annoying, I usually know what sort of trip I'll be making beforehand and roughly how far the sections are.   I've thought it would be good if they could implement a tap off system for 2 section trips (don't tap off or tap off outside the area = 2 hour ticket, tap off within the area = 2 section ticket). There are probably technical issues with that idea though."
Adelaide,3dcuat,SparkyRailgun,-3,Thu Jul 16 04:30:25 2015 UTC,Metrocard is awful. I was getting charged $4.9 each way for travelling 7km each way. In WA I only pay $4.70 for the WHOLE DAY and travel 20 km.   South Australians are being ripped off in every single aspect of their lives.

I'm moving to Adelaide next month and I'm looking at catching the 500 or 502 into the city off Bridge Road. Apparently the bus time table says I can get from Bridge Road to Grenfell St in roughly 30 minutes. I honestly didn't think the buses could get there so quick.
Adelaide,3dcuat,MisuVir,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:56:02 2015 UTC,"Depends on traffic.  From Paradise Interchange via the O-Bahn, you get to Grenfell St really quickly. I haven't actually timed the trip, but it is definitely quicker than driving. O-Bahn is a 100 km/hr express bus line that drops busses just outside the CBD on Dequetteville Tce.  The only times I've had a slow trip have been when some dork drives their car onto the O-Bahn and shuts it down, or if something like the Clipsal 500 is on and Dequetteville Tce is congested."
Adelaide,3dcuat,Rerh,0,Thu Jul 16 00:21:30 2015 UTC,"Yeah I find that most of the time my bus / tram is early by a minute or two. If I leave work on time I can make the bus, but not if it's early. I use apps like Moovit to see the realtime arrivals, but I find that sometimes they can be off by a minute... and that's all that makes/breaks me making the bus."
Adelaide,3dcuat,MisuVir,1 point,Wed Jul 15 11:45:00 2015 UTC,"I use apps like Moovit[1] to see the realtime arrivals   If you go to the Adelaide Metro site on your phone, there's a ""real-time arrival"" section. It uses the GPS locations of busses (or timetable estimate if the bus is not GPS equipped) to estimate how long until they arrive at your current stop. Works quite well in my experience."
Adelaide,3dcuat,dav3n,7,Thu Jul 16 00:26:37 2015 UTC,"I grew up in the north east and never had tooooo much trouble with the O Bahn. One week, though, after my bus was late or didn't come for four days in a row, I sent a complaint through to either Adelaide Metro itself, or to the relevant Minister's office (this was at least 3.5 years ago, so the specifics escape me) and received an itemised letter back explaining why each bus had been late!  E.g.  Monday 7am bus - driver was sick, replacement was late. Tuesday 7am bus - engine troubles at depot, left 20 mins late.  etc etc.  Was an unexpectedly detailed and specific response! Though that said, didn't make up for the week long lateness to work!"
Adelaide,3dcuat,jigsaw153,1 point,Wed Jul 15 10:41:49 2015 UTC,"The last time my bus failed to arrive, it was because the driver had crashed into a light pole a couple of suburbs over. Fair enough. :P"

I could rant for ages, but basically they need to bulldoze half of the train stations = trains run faster = faster rail line, and need to invest in more grade separations. I could go on all night, but that's just the tip of the iceberg."

Adelaide,3dcuat,LivinginAdelaide,2,Wed Jul 15 07:24:49 2015 UTC,"The bus that gets me to work and back is fine depending on the time. It's usually on time or at most a couple of minutes late, sometimes earlier (I'm not at a timed spot and 'cause I'm awful at getting ready in the morning I've missed it a couple of times - my fault).  However I do everything I can to avoid it at peak hour leaving the city. On rare occasions I'll bust home early - 4:45 or earlier - and keep working from there, otherwise every bus from 5pm to 6pm is basically a sardine can and unpleasant. Easier to wait.  I catch buses around the city and in every other direction fairly often to go to interviews etc and they vary from reliable and easy to super late. I think the city is basically a focal point where any bit of earliness or lateness is exacerbated by traffic etc."
Adelaide,3dcuat,aytakk,2,Wed Jul 15 07:33:19 2015 UTC,"I think it was short sighted to only order the new trains as 3-car constructs. I don't know if they have the flexibility to detach and re-attach to make longer trains or not, but I think they should have longer sets to better service the higher trafficked Gawler and Seaford lines.  Oh and fuck the B10 to Magill."
Adelaide,3dcuat,dav3n,1 point,Wed Jul 15 08:54:26 2015 UTC,"The new trains can be coupled to make 6 carriage trains, but certain platforms can't hold trains that long, they have been used after football as 6 carriages and the last doors of the last carriage stay shut, it's not really an issue you can walk through the entire 3 carriage 4000 set. The Gawler line can't use the new trains, but the 3000 class trains can couple together to form longer sets, the 2 car 3000 sets outside of peak every 15mins on the Gawler line are perfectly fine, in peak they could couple two together. The one carriage trains should never be used, they should all be used in sets of two which can be joint together to make 4 or 6 carriage trains."
Adelaide,3dcuat,stormraivan,1 point,Wed Jul 15 10:32:20 2015 UTC,I have seen them coupled once before as /u/torrens86 mentioned. But it would be nice to couple two of the new trains on the express train that leaves just after 5pm.
Adelaide,3dcuat,UnicornPenguinCat,1 point,Wed Jul 15 11:46:16 2015 UTC,"That's still a problem though. The 6 car doubles are too long to fit into some stations, and the 3 car ones get too cramped in peak hours. The best solution would be to be able to decouple the sections and make 4 and car trains for peak hours."

Adelaide,3dcuat,nightjesus,2,Wed Jul 15 11:18:46 2015 UTC,Public transit in SA works for the most part. I would rather a bus be late than early as a 30 minute wait (60 mins on weekends) is worse than 15 minutes for a missed connecting train.  The trip planner tied in with google maps has a habit of picking the worst routes possible but the planner on the metro website works great.  What they really need to do is bring back late night buses on Friday nights again. Doing hourly trains on Friday/Saturday nights after midnight would be awesome too - as well as or instead of.
Adelaide,3dcuat,drspeedyy,2,Wed Jul 15 17:13:53 2015 UTC,"The whole system cops a lot of flak but it's really not that bad. Buses are mostly on time, and when they're not it usually can't be helped, shit happens when you're dealing with people/traffic/conditions.  Not much can be done about the trains, you can put shiny new ones on there and make them electric, but it's hard to make major changes to it other than the odd extension.  Light Rail is probably where they need to pick up their game. I know we're probably stuck with them now but the current Trams aren't that great, they get overcrowded very easily and there have been all sorts of issues they've needed to fix (eg. A/C not capable of operating in the Australian heat). They also need to look at expanding the system where they can, I know there are long term plans in place but they really need to happen. It shouldn't be too had to put one through North Adelaide and down Prospect Road, down Port Road, Norwood is happening at some point, places like that that'll hopefully make people re-assess their decision to clog the roads.  The Smartcards and Real-time is where they've really excelled. Some people still struggle with them, but the smartcards really speed everything up, not only when boarding but also reducing the need to buy tickets constantly. The transport/passenger tracking information helps design better routes, and opening up the Real-time data to the public lets people create better mobile apps."
Adelaide,3dcuat,mangringo,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:20:32 2015 UTC,"Moved from Brisbane to Adelaide early last year, I prefer the Adelaide system much better personally it just sucks as much as you'd expect public transport to compared to Brisbane which is way too expensive, never runs on time and where I lived no buses ran after 7pm (great for late night shop when working retail, not) lol. Don't use buses or trams in Adelaide much though so my experience is on the trains which I suffer too often ... they just need to be more of them running on the weekends and after 7pm imo. Sitting around for an hour because I finish just after a train leaves seriously sucks and if I manage to score a shift that finishes before I run my ass off to catch it. Just one more train per hour would be bliss and my only complaint on the system as I've experienced it."

It was slightly cheaper to catch public transport in Melbourne (not sure if it still is) and the train services were more frequent, but in the morning they were often so crowded that I physically wouldn't be able to get on, and would have to wait for the next train."

You can almost never get a park, and need to park heaps far away. WAY more trams needed in the city, always over crowded during peak times. More trains/carriages on the GAWLER line, always over crowded during peak times. As far as reliability with times etc, the average wait time for me is usually under 5 mins for a late bus/train/tram. The longest was 45 mins, but that was a one-off."

I know what parking is like at Paradise so I don't want to be competing for spots there.  Otherwise I might need to catch the bus (500 or 502) from Bridge Rd. Not sure which is better.

Adelaide,3dcuat,franzyfunny,1 point,Wed Jul 15 09:32:34 2015 UTC,Always thought it was rubbish when I caught it in high school but recently I've had to commute via bus for the first time since I finished university and I think it has improved a lot. Buses are rarely completely packed like they are elsewhere in the world and at rush hour they are usually pretty good as far as being on time goes. Metro card is a god send and I'm glad the state government invested in bringing it in.
Adelaide,3dcuat,abuch47,1 point,Wed Jul 15 11:52:55 2015 UTC,I catch buses along Anzac Highway to and from work in the winter months and the occasional tram. Using the real time tracking for my stops I know whether to run to catch one or chill out and take my time walking to the next one. Don't even look at a timetable.  Buses are frequent during peak hour but could be more frequent at other times. Auto topping up MetroCard works a treat but I'd like to be able to buy the 28 day passes online.  Oh and free travel to and from the footy rocks.
Adelaide,3dcuat,franzyfunny,0,Thu Jul 16 06:14:34 2015 UTC,"I don't think I've ever been on a tram that didn't smell like piss... I usually just end up smelling my hands the entire time I'm on them.  Busses are ok most of the time but I've had them drive straight past me when I've been hailing them, that or they show up early when you're on your way to the stop and all you can do is wave them goodbye. Also too many times have I arrived in the city on my first bus just in time to see my second bus leave.   Trains are ok but catching the Gawler line after a certain time and those security guards might as well not be there... extra nighttime security at the stations would be nice too.  Metrocards are cool, the less interaction with people during my commute the better."

Adelaide,3dcuat,euclydian,0,Wed Jul 15 12:03:48 2015 UTC,"It cops a lot of flak (and deservedly so in a lot of cases), but for my area I'm lucky in that it's not been too bad. Metrocard has always worked well for me too. Stinky buses/trains are not a local phenomenon.  I think the problem Adelaide public transport has is the servicing population is small but spread out over a wide area. The vast majority of people drive cars which makes the roads more congested and buses late, and reduces ticket revenue.  Comparing Adelaide to a city like Munich in Germany, the populations are similar (granted Munich would get a shitload more tourists and transient visitors), but the Munich subway+tram+bus system shits all over our public transport. Then you consider Munich has a land area (according to Google) of 310 km2 compared to Adelaide's 1800 km2 and population density may be a very significant factor.   I'm sure a lot of people visit Munich from surrounding large towns too so on second thoughts perhaps that's not the best example. Regardless, I think the spread of our population plays a big part in public transport issues."
Adelaide,3dcuat,dissonate,3,Wed Jul 15 07:39:41 2015 UTC,"Yep, you can't even begin to compare Adelaide and Munich. Yes, the populations are similar, but Munich is 4x smaller in area.  I pay €42 a month for absolutely unlimited travel on tram, train, underground and buses in the first 2 rings which covers 99% of my travel. We used to own a car... But it was being used so little, we sold it.  Munich had the Olympics in 1972 which was predicted to cause massive influxes of people who needed public transport. So in the late 60s they built the beginnings of the S-Bahn and U-Bahn networks and haven't looked back. The systems are amazing and if not for them, Munich would be in gridlock. When train drivers have been on strike, even just for one network, the city goes chaotic because of the huge reliance on our public transport systems."
Adelaide,3dcuat,SparkyRailgun,0,Wed Jul 15 10:28:40 2015 UTC,"I've not had much trouble during peak hour. I usually just walk to the bus stop closest to my house or sometimes I walk all the way to Paradise Interchange. From there, O-Bahn services into the city are pretty much non-stop and rarely full unless everyone happens to load onto one bus.  Once I get to the city, I wait about 10 minutes for a bus heading out of the city to my work. This bus is almost always completely empty.  If I see that one of the peak hour busses is full or nearing full, I usually just choose to wait another 5, 10, 15 minutes for another bus that is less full. There are so many busses going up the O-Bahn that it really doesn't matter if I skip one.  I don't believe I caught a train in the last decade and I've only been on the tram system once or twice, so I can't comment on those.  As for the Metrocard, I think it is great. The system works very well. I have my account set up to auto-recharge my card and my wife's card and all of our student cards. I've never had to go and recharge my card manually. Tapping on when boarding a bus is quick and painless. It is also nice that we don't have to tap off like in some other states. The lack of transport zones helps keep things simple too."

It's not like the ability to do so is hard. With my experiences even if ten people recharge their card on the bus, it doesn't make the bus driver late to the next stop.

I think some neigbouring councils, Charles Sturt or West Torrens shold try and set up Fringe venues, In NPSP and Unley the idea would never get in. Port Road has the free tram and a lot venues. Here's an idea remove some of the Parklands and put them under different council control - eg Bonython Park would belong to Charles Sturt, The Parklands would remain the same, just have more events since the local council would use them and appreciate them much more then the ACC does."
Adelaide,3d8xwt,ireaditonredditsir,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:59:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you're right about the carpark lobby hah. I think the markets are about the easiest place to get to by car in town. I also think the Central Markets are probably one of the few groups that have the power to tell ACC to go stuff themselves if there were objections.  I went to a little presentation by the new Fringe director and she made it sound like they were working on a couple of things... 1) streamlining venues wanting to hold Fringe events, 2) making it way more obvious which venues were Fringe venues and 3) getting it outside of the usual places (3 comes up every year but new director might mean more luck doing it).  So there's a chance. It makes sense along the free tramlines when you have disparate venues (say down Port Road), and also the councils further out with little concentrations of possible venues - Port Adelaide itself, the new Henley Square could even run with it, etc etc.  As for the Parklands idea, it's nice (not sure how it would go) but I think it's very, very unlikely."

Adelaide,3d8xwt,hexiledgame,5,Wed Jul 15 03:48:33 2015 UTC,"Special event pop-up venues often have the benefit of the novelty effect of a new eating/drinking establishment.   Already established venues would have to remodel/relaunch their operation to have this benefit so the argument that venues like RCC are ""taking their money"" really doesn't hold water."
Adelaide,3d8xwt,hydr0xide,0,Tue Jul 14 20:53:58 2015 UTC,It is a novelty. Exactly. It comes and goes. These established places have all year to make money and build a customer base.

Adelaide,3d8xwt,hydr0xide,10,Wed Jul 15 22:12:10 2015 UTC,"I haven't been before, but it's not being canned, it's just being moved somewhere else. Who knows, maybe the new venue will be even better (maybe the park on the corner of South Tce and Grenfell St?)  That being said, this is so typical of the SA mentality and explains  perfectly why this state is going backwards. People enjoying themselves at something that isn't AFL football? Can't have that, shut it down. As someone else pointed out, who are all these people ""enjoying"" Victoria Square anyway? Office workers who need to find somewhere else to sit down and eat their lunch for a few weeks of the year? Jesus, it's pathetic."
Adelaide,3d8xwt,dav3n,3,Tue Jul 14 22:35:07 2015 UTC,"The problem is..... where are they going to move it? and what's the point of moving it? If it still exists in this form then brick and mortar venues are still going to ""lose business"" to it, and where ever it exists in the CBD it's going to ""kill the grass"" (apparently this is an issue, one that gets ignored at other Fringe sites) and create noise.  If noise levels are the issue then they can't move it to any of the other squares are they are much more heavily populated (plus they are too small), and the only real viable parklands are taken up by the Garden/Gluttony. You'll still have noise issues in the south parklands as it's fairly residentual, and dumping it out in the west by itself sounds like an out of sight, out of mind ""solution"". There's Bonython park, but that's a long way out of the way and doesn't really help the city. The Riverbank is used by another RCC site, which is too close to the other option of Elder Park.  It's just ridiculous that they've spent millions attempting to redesign Victoria Square into a usable space, yet one of the most popular things it gets used for is asked to move on."
Adelaide,3d8xwt,dav3n,0,Tue Jul 14 23:31:51 2015 UTC,"This state isn't going backwards, that's another typical Adelaide style mentality. People have this absurd inferiority complex where they always talk about how much they love Adelaide and then slam it as shitty in the same breath.  Adelaide is more vibrant than its been in decades and whilst this a pretty shitty example of the old adelaide mentality we are still progressing.   People in this city need to start being positive."
Adelaide,3d8xwt,insanopointless,4,Wed Jul 15 12:36:26 2015 UTC,"Err, given that previously there was a RCC in Victoria Square, and in future there will not be, I'd say that's going backwards (not to mention the highest unemployment in the country and continually high permanent exodus levels).   My point is that decisions like these only compound the problem. Unless something drastic is done soon, people are going to be in for a very rude awakening.   It's not being negative to recognise that there's a problem. It's being pragmatic."

Adelaide,3d8xwt,dav3n,3,Thu Jul 16 08:01:17 2015 UTC,"I don't see a big issue with this at all. At the end of the day, it's a temporary event which generates an income for a month a year?  How does that add to the economy at all? I would say that the local establishments who dutifully pay rates, state payroll tax, workcover levy, etc etc and employ staff 12 months of the year add considerably more to the economy than a temporary venue that milks a site for a month then is gone. It's like saying that a bunch of gypsys selling arts and crafts in a city for a month is great and adds to the economy. It's flawed logic.  SA needs to perform a radical shift in it's economy in a very short time, and you can't do that with small bars and pop up events. They add nothing. They build nothing. Why do they deserve so many headlines?"
Adelaide,3d8xwt,hal0eight,7,Tue Jul 14 23:30:12 2015 UTC,"You're right, it adds nothing at all............. it only had 210,000 people through the gates (70k for Fringe Shows) and contributed $6mil in ""economic activity"". We're not talking about some mega company who makes millions then disappears, we're talking about some local guys who put on a good show for a month and barely broke even last year. You honestly think that having this ""behemoth"" appear every now and then which causes a slight downturn in profit in a couple of other local venues is going to destroy SA. The State and the ACC are actively trying to revitalize the city and make it more attractive to visitors and potential migrants, you could argue that shunning this kind of event makes the state look less attractive."
Adelaide,3d8xwt,basefield,2,Tue Jul 14 23:56:09 2015 UTC,Would be interesting to see if the numbers for money spent are increased by RCC or its merely moving it around.  If they are barely breaking even and its only moving money that would be spend elsewhere during Fringe anyway /u/hal0eight has a point
Adelaide,3d8xwt,caitsith01,2,Wed Jul 15 01:32:08 2015 UTC,"Given there was a 20% increase in Fringe Ticket sales this year, I'd say RCC would have helped that number a little.  I assume they meant 2014 when they said ""last year"", I'd say they would have profited this year but they certainly wouldn't be raking it in."
Adelaide,3d8xwt,kordos,2,Wed Jul 15 01:55:17 2015 UTC,"What makes the state look attractive is investment into infrastructure and things that are permanent. Those things = JOBS.  Any money spent at the RCC ultimately ends not creating or building anything here, in fact, a fair bit of it gets pissed down the sewer.   What is the actual measure of the $6mil ""economic activity"" created? I mean it's a fairly nebulous term. Is that activity that ended up at bars/restaurants and fringe shows? Did it build any infrastructure that can continue to promote investment into permanent things in the state?  Bread and games do not lead an economic recovery. You need to create a solid environment for investors to invest into infrastructure and a workforce here. I've been doing the rounds of investment roadshows, start up conferences etc for the past 18 months, and the smart money is NOT investing in SA. In fact most of the investors will tell you that you are nuts to invest here.  So that's how you end up with an Australia high unemployment figure and arguably negative growth. Nobody building anything permanent = no business to operate = no jobs = less money to splash around = economic decline = unemployment.  So that's the short version of why I don't understand what the fuss about these guys is. If they are running a business, why should it be local/state government's responsibility to subsidise them and give them special treatment? If they are making a loss or breaking even they need to restructure the business or shut down. Does that mean Mrs. Smith's coffee shop should get special treatment as well?"

He's also trying to get rid of bike lanes, leading to more congestion and a less pedestrian friendly CBD.

It's ridiculous the council won't put up lights as there are people there constantly, actually using the parklands.  I wrote to the council about it a couple of years ago and got a default response.  I also complained that ALL of the solar powered lights in the parklands don't work, at all.  I'm not a parkland crusader, I just live a across the road, get excited to see people use it, and wish they would develop parts of it to encourage usage."
Adelaide,3d39gz,taco_makin,4,Mon Jul 13 09:39:33 2015 UTC,have been looking for one of these in adelaide for so long! honestly think we should petition for the council to put lights on the wakefield st court or the south terrace pultney courts

Adelaide,3d1ejk,In_House,9,Sun Jul 12 18:53:25 2015 UTC,"What you need is a debit card aka EFTPOS card. You can get one with most banks in Australia by opening a basic account. They're usually visa cards, work on online for purchases like a credit card, but the difference is that the money comes from your savings account and there's usually no surcharge. You just say to the cashier, ""savings"".  Except when buying airfares because airlines charge you for everything."
Adelaide,3d1ejk,brradism,3,Sun Jul 12 21:48:15 2015 UTC,Not at Coles or at any of the big stores. Surcharges are usually only applied by small stores.
Adelaide,3d1ejk,MisuVir,3,Sun Jul 12 21:36:17 2015 UTC,"I thought I read somewhere that merchants can't charge fees when the customer is using Visa / Mastercard? Likewise when they shop is using a BankSA / Commbank machine. Could be wrong, and I CBF trawling through T&C's."
Adelaide,3d1ejk,dizzie131,3,Mon Jul 13 01:03:46 2015 UTC,"I've always had a MasterCard and it certainly can have a credit surcharge applied.   Nothing worse than going down to the local bakery, not having cash, and finding they have a $10 minimum and a surcharge for credit cards. Screw it, McDonald's it is."
Adelaide,3d1ejk,MisuVir,3,Mon Jul 13 01:08:13 2015 UTC,"Sorry, what I meant was that in the T&C's for accepting Visa / MasterCard, a retailer isn't allowed to charge a surcharge. However that doesn't stop retailers doing so."
Adelaide,3d1ejk,dizzie131,2,Mon Jul 13 01:10:46 2015 UTC,"Surcharges are usually only applied by some small stores.   FTFY.  Many small places don't charge a surcharge, or only charge a surcharge for certain cards.  And usually it'll be 1% or something like that.  Just ask."
Adelaide,3d1ejk,caitsith01,3,Mon Jul 13 01:11:04 2015 UTC,"The vast majority of merchants won't whack on a surcharge, so you should be OK. Your rent is an interesting one, if I was you I would just wear the 1-2% fee, as your alternative of setting up a local account and transferring it would probably be a pain in the ass."
Adelaide,3d1ejk,holman8a,1 point,Sun Jul 12 22:11:42 2015 UTC,"The surcharge on the rent is probably a disincentive to credit card payments. Agents prefer payment by bank transfer, because then they don't have to issue a receipt unless you specifically ask for one."
Adelaide,3d1ejk,lasseffect,3,Mon Jul 13 03:39:49 2015 UTC,"I've only ever seen a % fee attached to ""American Express"" cards. Visa/Mastercard are usually free (small stores may have a minimum purchase or pay 50c-$2). Thats there because the card machines will charge the merchant a flat fee for using them.  Honestly, I wouldn't worry. Its never impacted my life and I doubt it'l trouble you more than a few bucks during your stay."
Adelaide,3d1ejk,Lifteatsleepdrink,3,Mon Jul 13 01:13:29 2015 UTC,Credit card surcharges apply to:   Flights Hotels (almost all)   Credit card surcharges rarely apply to:   Shopping Restaurants   You will however experience more fees from currency conversions generally speaking.
Adelaide,3d1ejk,taniane,2,Mon Jul 13 02:10:08 2015 UTC,As a foreigner a lot of this is very confusing as well. What OP is asking for is a standard eftpos debit. But what am I actually doing when I say credit on my standard eftpos card? Would I need an associated credit card account for that to mean anything?
Adelaide,3d1ejk,IC_Pandemonium,2,Sun Jul 12 22:50:38 2015 UTC,"credit on my standard eftpos card?   If it's actually just an EFTPOS card, nothing. The transaction will be declined.  If it's a Visa or Mastercard branded ""debit"" card, the transaction is processed by the merchant as though it was a credit card, but it draws from your bank account."
Adelaide,3d1ejk,KoalaSprint,1 point,Mon Jul 13 00:05:18 2015 UTC,"My understanding is that it is the discretion of the retailer. For example at my work there is a surcharge for Amex (common) but not for visa/mc and the surcharge amount was our discretion.   Things like bills, flights/accommodation and things where they want you to pay with cash usually have a surcharge, but not things like grocery shopping, retail etc (unless Amex). Hard to plan because it depends where you will be spending your money. It's not too common in day-to-day life so long as you have a visa or m/c"
Adelaide,3d1ejk,Prompus,1 point,Mon Jul 13 04:09:15 2015 UTC,"Credit card surcharges are pretty rare in Adelaide particularly in actual stores. Generally you only see them in the places with really tight margins, eg computer shops or Asian groceries. Your average supermarket, pharmacy or clothing store will absorb the merchants fee for you.  Surcharges are little more common in online stores, in particular with the ticket booking sites for airfare, accommodation, entertainment events, etc. But again there are just as many online retailers that absorb the charge as well.  As others have said it's a good idea to have an EFTPOS (debit) card as well. Most banks can link two additional accounts into your credit card, so you swipe the one card and then select Credit, Savings or Cheque on the terminal to choose where you want your funds to come from."
Adelaide,3czv7g,gpole,16,Sun Jul 12 07:53:39 2015 UTC,"I'm surprised that to access -any- of your writing I need to get through a pay wall. I'm not sure who's doing your marketing, but that's really sloppy (in my opinion). There's no hook: you're missing out on lots of customers who are not going to just front up $6 on the promise that the writing will be good. You should make one of the articles free to read, or at least the first two pages of one of the articles, just so people know what it's like. I might have bought it if I had more to go on, but no way am I going to buy a magazine by people I've never heard of without having read some of their writing first. Or at least a bit of a bio on who they are, and what they're writing about. Anything, really."
Adelaide,3czv7g,PicklesOverload,-3,Sun Jul 12 13:36:19 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your feedback, it is greatly appreciated. We will definitely take this into consideration, but just to be clear, this post is not intended to sell magazines. That would just be spam.  EDIT: we do have a facebook page which shows a lot more about our publication. https://www.facebook.com/pages/Omission-Magazine/405881872922137?fref=ts"
Adelaide,3czv7g,PicklesOverload,11,Sun Jul 12 13:42:58 2015 UTC,"I looked at your fb page already, in my hunt to see what sort of content I could expect. I don't know, you've got stuff like 'fine print' out at the moment and that magazine really showcases and advertises it's content well. It's hard enough to get people to read your magazine for free. Why should I not only dedicate my time to your magazine, but pay for it? There's nothing to go on. You've got no biographies for your editors that lends credibility to the publication either. You know, who are these people? Are they academics, do they have a history in journalism? This stuff should be immediately available on the website. The whole thing looks nice but I can't shake the feeling that there's going to be a half-baked product underneath it. If there was some writing that could speak for itself that would really help."
Adelaide,3czv7g,AdamDaze,-5,Sun Jul 12 15:03:51 2015 UTC,"We could rattle off our journalistic achievements, but we take a minimalist's approach. An approach that lets our content do the talking. I could be a PhD holder, but that doesn't mean my magazine is automatically considered good. What I am trying to say is that at the end of the day, if the magazine is good, it's good; if it's bad, then it's bad, regardless of our editors' curricula vitae.   The problem is: yes we like to let our content do the talking, but that's no use if potential readers don't know exactly what that content is, and we don't expect readers to be careless with their money. But please keep in mind, we have only released one issue thus far. For this reason I am in no way surprised by your perception of our publication. In an attempt to solve -- albeit just partially -- this problem, we are creating a blog. Our blog will be up and running by the middle of this week. Do you think that could potentially give you a better idea as to if you will be receiving a ""half-baked"" product or not?"
Adelaide,3czv7g,AdamDaze,15,Sun Jul 12 16:32:05 2015 UTC,"You need serious help with marketing and PR.  Every first impression is your last first impression. Mine is that I've gone to a site that lists nothing of note about your first issue. Then demands money. Okay, so your facebook page does, I totally missed the minimalist logo further down that pages design. But why would I click on it after being turned off by a paywall?  There's not even a content list / articles list simply presented on the SALE PAGE of your FIRST EDITION.  Think long and hard about that first sentence. There's minimalist, and there's ""this doesn't communicate anything"". For a communications company, that's a problem.  Your content doesn't talk if people can't read it. You've identified that problem in this thread, but again, have not published the solution at launch, which makes it appear that you don't have one.  Is this even a launch? You mention you aren't here trying to sell magazines. Why in gods name are you trying to source stories with a half-finished end product, from the Adelaide subreddit, one of your potential future marketing channels? Or seed customer bases?  Again, first impressions only work the first time.  Tens of solid free publications have died. Onion, ripitup, all have gone digital-only and free. Best of luck bucking that trend. For paid content online you need an absolutely premium brand and so far this isn't it."
Adelaide,3czv7g,InertiaCreeping,-3,Sun Jul 12 18:28:03 2015 UTC,"So like a preview of each of the stories on the sale page? You see, I am a writer not a marketer. We are currently in the process of acquiring someone's services to help with the marketing, as we've had to do it all ourselves thus far, even though we hardly know anything about it.   Also can you elaborate on what you mean buy a ""half-finished end product."" The magazine itself is clearly not just ""half-finished."""
Adelaide,3czv7g,PicklesOverload,6,Mon Jul 13 01:34:00 2015 UTC,"It is to me, because I can't see anything of it. No previous. No list of interviewees. Not even how many pages you get for the money. People don't like ""Risking"" their money online.  For all anyone knows it's a scam site. You need to understand 1st visitors don't know you. They don't trust you."
Adelaide,3czv7g,OzRockabella,6,Mon Jul 13 03:18:47 2015 UTC,I agree. All I can see are some artfully-composed photos of people sitting in chairs. Who are these people? Why do I care? TELL ME

Adelaide,3czv7g,Lifteatsleepdrink,3,Mon Jul 13 07:46:21 2015 UTC,"Well yeah, absolutely it would. I don't mean any offense by the term half baked, I just mean that I sincerely have nothing to go on, at all, and so that's one of the doubts that arises.  Incidentally, if you do have a PhD and you mentioned it on the site it absolutely would make a difference, because it would show that you're clearly a competent writer, most likely dedicated to your work, and that you would be more likely to have a high standard of content. Listing a biography like that is crucial in garnering interest, because the whole point is that your content can't immediately speak for itself because of the pay wall."

You're going to do really long hours and make very little money. In addition to that, every third client will argue with you and try to scam you. You'll end up doing windows installs onsite for $20 and be on call for the rest of your life. Advertising in the trading post/gumtree/messenger will result in the kind of low spend/low value clients you DON'T want. Aiming for the pensioner/people who aren't at work demographic is a hard sell at all times.  Are you part of a minority community (e.g. asian/sudanese/etc)? If so you could probably do OK by advertising through their native language news/paper service. This is the only place I'd say go for it with a small IT business.  If you're aiming for general people on the street, I'd strongly urge you to get a RSA (responsible service of alcohol) ticket and get a bar/restaurant job rather than try to do a small IT business. Pay is quite high and you can do it out of uni hours. Also, you'll meet a lot more useful people and have more fun."

Adelaide,3cyzy2,saxonf,-1,Sun Jul 12 15:30:38 2015 UTC,"I'd imagine that when Sunday trading was first introduced, the Churchies were bitching that being open early on a Sunday meant that people wouldn't be going to church. Over here (in Sydney), the larger stores tend to be open from 7am or so while the smaller stores don't open until 10am."
Adelaide,3cyzy2,VicBiasWatch,-5,Sun Jul 12 09:34:34 2015 UTC,Their argument might go a little something like this;  Your opening your shop during the recognised day of rest is destroying the morals and values that we as a society hold. You are not free to do that because it is harming our society.

Adelaide,3cswym,Luzern_,7,Sat Jul 11 08:35:43 2015 UTC,"You'll find it's been like that on the Grenfell street bus stops since the mid 1980's. When the O-Bahn first came into operation the bus stops had lines marked on the pavement for people to line up between.  The O-Bahn has a huge amount of different services that use it (they all use the track before splitting off at either Paradise or TTP interchanges), and a majority of those buses use the stops on Grenfell street.  It used to be even more crowded even with the line up as most services used to use only stop F1 which is the one closest to King William Street. But in the late 90's they started adding more stops which are used specifically at Peak to separate services and spread the numbers of waiting passengers away from a single stop and out along Grenfell street. So it could be a lot worse than what it is.  TL;DR - People have lined up since the O-Bahn started and it's stuck throughout the years."
Adelaide,3cswym,E231-500,7,Fri Jul 10 19:17:30 2015 UTC,"""Why do people line up for busses"".  Yep. I'm in /r/adelaide"
Adelaide,3cswym,AdamDaze,5,Sat Jul 11 13:49:41 2015 UTC,Where else should they stand? In a giant mess completely blocking the sidewalk?
Adelaide,3cswym,Sitin,6,Fri Jul 10 18:34:41 2015 UTC,"I remember when stand up comic Eddie Ifft came and did some shows for the Fringe, and his first 10 mins was solely about him noticing how people line up for the bus on Grenfell St. Was fucking hilarious."
Adelaide,3cswym,soundawake,3,Sat Jul 11 05:40:05 2015 UTC,So they leave a 4+ meter gap ... and there is no space to walk through?
Adelaide,3cswym,execicide,0,Fri Jul 10 15:05:50 2015 UTC,"There's a gap, but you have to walk in front of a long line of people and then cut through the line of people getting on the bus.  It just seems more natural for pedestrian traffic to go behind the line of people waiting."
Adelaide,3cswym,MisuVir,2,Fri Jul 10 15:10:07 2015 UTC,Are they trying to shelter under the verandahs
Adelaide,3cswym,LivinginAdelaide,1 point,Sat Jul 11 08:37:35 2015 UTC,"Possibly... but this happens year round, no matter the weather. I think it is just ""the thing that people do"" when lining up for busses on Grenfell."
Adelaide,3cswym,MisuVir,-4,Sat Jul 11 09:55:44 2015 UTC,"Hard to describe, but all the benches and shit are between them and the curb, it's really awkward to walk through. I generally do anyway but most people don't, since you'd have to find a point of entry through all the people lining up anyway"
Adelaide,3cswym,execicide,21,Fri Jul 10 15:09:50 2015 UTC,"Honestly there is enough of a gap to walk through that I never saw it as an issue ... but beyond that, the reason (and its been a while since I have caught the bus, but I caught on to the reason for why) seems to be as follows ...  Most of the stops service a number of bus routes, so people are lining up for a number of different busses ... so they line up away from the curb, when the bus comes up, those catching that bus step out of the line and go to the curb to catch the bus, everyone in the ""back"" shuffles up into the queue for the next bus.  It works and there really is enough space for pedestrians going through (at least from my recollection for them to get through without to much hassle)."
Adelaide,3cswym,greenmartian26,7,Fri Jul 10 15:18:23 2015 UTC,"This is the correct answer. Plus, in winter, when our rains are accompanied by heavy wind, being too close to the kerb facing the road is really not really the most comfortable position.."

Adelaide,3cswym,MisuVir,4,Mon Jul 13 08:31:08 2015 UTC,"I've often wondered this. It is a phenomenon that only appears to happen on Grenfell Street. Combine it with that person who always has to stand next to the wall instead of in the line, and suddenly there's only room for one person to fit through."
Adelaide,3cswym,princesspeachey,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:09:19 2015 UTC,"Only on the northern side of Grenfell Street though - the southern side (ie, for busses that don't go on the Obahn) doesn't queue like this."

Adelaide,3cswym,dav3n,2,Sun Jul 12 00:04:39 2015 UTC,"Each side of the road seems to be different. On the north side everyone lines up nicely and it just works, sure it's slow to negotiate during peak times but given the amount of people in the area it's about as good as it can get. Just do what I do and walk on the inside (between the line and the road).  I've got no idea what people are trying to do on the south side though(particularly across from Rundle Plaza), people just randomly stand in the middle of the footpath and completely block foot traffic."

Adelaide,3cq27c,limbofap,13,Thu Jul 9 21:26:52 2015 UTC,"The typical budget for a 2 bedroom, 1 bathroom apartment in the heart of the CBD near universities is between $370 and $410 per week. 3 bedrooms are usually about $450 to $480 per week so your budget of $800 for rent is not needed.  The closer to Rundle Mall and universities you get, the higher the price is. If you look for properties that are, say, a 10 or 15 minute walk from your university you will pay less depending on amenities provided by the apartment or apartment building.  Adelaide is alright but can get pretty boring after a while. If you're studying full time maybe think about going to the restaurants around Gouger Street and that area of the CBD to find a part time or casual job.  Best of luck with your travels & study!  Edit: here is a website that is mostly used in South Australia to find properties to rent or buy. http://www.realestate.com.au/rent/property-unit+apartment-with-3-bedrooms-in-adelaide%2c+sa+5000%3b/list-1?includeSurrounding=false - Try to stick with companies like Unilodge because they cater to the demographic of Students looking for accommodation.  Also look at www.gumtree.com.au and your University websites as they are also great sources of finding property for students.  If you need help finding something you can PM me. I have some property manager friends near the CBD who may be able to assist in finding you something."

Adelaide,3cmppm,kingy88,5,Thu Jul 9 09:08:40 2015 UTC,"Totally agree. Most people in this thread have got it backwards - you simply cannot have an economy driven by government expenditure alone. Calling for ""clean energy projects"" is going to do SFA - taxing people with the left hand and spending it with the right does not an economy make.  Long-term private sector investment and growth is the only answer. The state government can and should help with this - and this is exactly where they have dropped the ball."
Adelaide,3cmppm,KNuCK13_70P,2,Fri Jul 10 07:31:33 2015 UTC,Agree with you on this. But again we're behind on this. Look at what Singapore has managed to do in getting start ups to move there.

Adelaide,3cmppm,hydr0xide,1 point,Thu Jul 9 09:18:44 2015 UTC,Look at what Singapore has managed to do   You have just proven that you know absolutely nothing with that comment.

I suggest you do a bit of research into the levels of poverty and income inequality in Singapore; you might change your tune and realise that it's not all that bad here by comparison.
Adelaide,3cmppm,hydr0xide,3,Thu Jul 9 11:41:35 2015 UTC,"What makes you think Singapore is corrupt?

Adelaide,3cmppm,KNuCK13_70P,0,Fri Jul 10 00:44:54 2015 UTC,"Corruption Perception Index. Think about the very name; it's how people perceive the level of corruption. Global media, business and governments all work very well together to ensure that as many people as possible perceive them as not being corrupt.  Governments like the Singaporean government do their best to ensure that big business is well looked after as they stand to gain a lot of income from encouraging many businesses to take advantage of their extremely low tax rates. In essence, instead of doing what's actually best for the country and the majority of its citizens, they do the bidding of big business, who in turn provides the government with enough money to keep the politicians happy; this is the very definition of corruption. Both of our major parties in Australia are also accountable to either big business or unions and are also corrupt. They, with the help of the mainstream media, have somehow convinced the majority of the population that this practice somehow benefits everyone, which is why many people perceive there to be no corruption."
Adelaide,3cmppm,kingy88,2,Fri Jul 10 02:38:38 2015 UTC,"You are so deluded. I actually do know what I am talking about.

Adelaide,3cmppm,kingy88,0,Fri Jul 10 03:25:41 2015 UTC,"I'm deluded?  Meanwhile, your company would employ such tactics as paying their CEO's more money at the expense of the lower level workers which would further contribute to the unemployment crisis. Having offices in Singapore, Philippines and Bangkok because you can get away with paying lower level workers next to nothing over there as opposed to having to pay minimum or award wages in Australia. Do you really think that the presence of your business is beneficial to the local inhabitants of these places? Well it isn't; it's beneficial to your business only. You take money from these places to make your business richer while leaving the common people in these places poorer.  This is how every capitalist business operates; to say that yours doesn't would be admitting that you are deluded. Capitalists believe that money is more important than humanity and the environment, so I'm sorry that you prefer to live in a fascist corporatocracy where 1 in 5 people are living below the poverty line with absolutely no hope of ever being able to succeed. At least government businesses operate as public services and not capitalist, for-profit businesses where profits come before service.  Not only does capitalism cause unemployment, it profits from and actively creates it, traditionally with 5% unemployment being the most efficient level. But, businesses like yours with offices in tax havens like Singapore will end up pushing that ideal level of unemployment to higher levels like 10% or as high as they can get away with.  So yeah, place all the blame for the current unemployment crisis on the SA government who are probably doing more than most to reverse it. I'm not saying that they're completely blameless, but they certainly aren't as responsible as the many other factors involved."

Adelaide,3cmppm,shakaspeare,0,Fri Jul 10 00:50:07 2015 UTC,"Big business chooses to operate in these countries because they can afford to pay these workers a much lower rate of pay than what they would be forced to in Australia, for example.

Of the three countries mentioned here, Thailand has the highest minimum wage at ~US$1.22 per hour, Australia's minimum wage is ~US$15.58 by comparison. You can see why these companies choose to set up business in these countries instead of Australia.  Also, these businesses don't employ everyone in these countries.  Essentially, global corporations take money from these countries and add it to their own wealth as opposed to re-investing in that country. If they weren't present, the local economy would be on a smaller local scale where money would remain inside the local level and circulate amongst the community. This is also the fundamental flaw with a global economy.  The real answer to your question is far more complex than what I have written here, this is just an oversimplification."
Adelaide,3cmppm,PAFC2004,2,Fri Jul 10 02:54:28 2015 UTC,"I think you will find globalisation has decreased poverty and improved standards in countries that have participated such as Thailand, China and India. China massively gained from ""opening the door"" which was their re-entry to globalisation during the communist reign, after years of famine and decline. A good example of one of your ""small local economies"" without globalisation or capitalism would be North Korea, which is the sort of structure you seem to be advocating."
Adelaide,3cmppm,shakaspeare,0,Fri Jul 10 04:01:50 2015 UTC,"Don't kid yourself, globalisation has only improved the standard of living of those who can afford it and their numbers are quickly declining. If your argument was correct, we'd be seeing a falling unemployment rate, not an increasing one.  Increasing the wealth of those at the top does not equal decreasing poverty."

Adelaide,3cmppm,suicidal_smrtcar,6,Fri Jul 10 04:20:18 2015 UTC,"Just to put it in perspective, only 2,700 new full time jobs have been created in SA in the last 5 years. In May and June 2015 SA has shed 14,000 full time jobs.   That's what happens when you have no plan and put all your eggs in one basket. SA can blame the ""changing economy"" all they like but why is SA so much above the national trend in unemployment. This is an SA problem and Jay et al need to stop blaming everyone else."
Adelaide,3cmppm,hydr0xide,7,Thu Jul 9 03:55:34 2015 UTC,"It's part of a trend that's affecting various parts of the world to varying degrees. But yeah, so far as Oz is concerned, Adelaide is getting hit hardest and I don't see any let-up.  Where I differ from most people is that I don't think it matters much which party we have in power. They are pushing against forces of larger systemic changes which simply have not been prepared for."
Adelaide,3cmppm,maxblack88,-2,Thu Jul 9 04:36:11 2015 UTC,Disagree. Just look at what they did with the training funding in this budget...awarding 95% of training funding to Tafe SA instead of letting private training providers compete. Now jobs are being shed in productive private businesses instead of getting rid of the over bloated Tafe SA public service.   Edit to add they for the most part though I do think SA Libs are pretty useless. They have little vision for SA.
Adelaide,3cmppm,EyesAllOnFire,12,Thu Jul 9 04:40:00 2015 UTC,"If you think that the TAFE SA shift is a major contributor for this downturn you'd be wrong - the effects of that won't be felt for a while. Not to mention the fact that there were a shit tonne of dodgy trainers and the reason the program was shifted is that the majority of those programs didn't result in jobs. Whether it's the right move or not, time will tell. Plenty of people say it isn't, but it's irrelevant to much of this (for now).  The majority of SA's problems are, as /u/Chartist said, externalities. Out of our control. See the RET dilution killing some of the biggest investments this state would see in a long time (Ceres etc), manufacturing leaving (tried to delay it, could have longer with more Federal support but it was going eventually), Olympic Dam, automation is going to have a large effect and already is, Subs (promised to Japan, the delays and 'consultations' are just to string it out), etc.  Chinese investment has been keeping lots of regions alive and that could possibly dry up if their markets keep going the way they are.  It's a tricky question, and I am by no means saying SA Labor are blameless (They've done good and bad... personally I'd take them over state Liberals as it seems almost anyone would right now) but the last thing is to look at the issue parochially."
Adelaide,3cmppm,maxblack88,2,Thu Jul 9 05:31:54 2015 UTC,"I'm with you guys, I think a lot of the issues facing the state are mostly due to national/global economic problems. Sure that's not the only cause but it seems to be mostly external to me.  It's unfortunate that we seem to be hit with an unlucky combination of circumstances affecting multiple industries and don't really have much else to fall back on to take up the economic 'slack' in this state.   Manufacturing downturn, mining downturn, probable loss of future shipbuilding, oil price falling, construction downturn. Realistically the state government can't do a lot about most of that other than appeal for federal support for some of it, and try and undertake additional infrastructure projects (not sure how successful that may be)."
Adelaide,3cmppm,peckerbrain,1 point,Thu Jul 9 05:54:14 2015 UTC,"Yeah. I think you've basically got it.   State gov is limited in its responses. Some projects I think they've done quite a good job with (SAHMRI is good but payoff might be some time away, Tonsley has potential but I'm not 100% if it'll be as big as they hope). Others ~~~~ eh.   We're talking long cycles with just about anything worth doing here. Just as it takes some industries quite a bit of time to wind up, it takes new ones quite a long time (and encouragement) to spin up."
Adelaide,3cmppm,jigsaw153,-9,Thu Jul 9 06:10:54 2015 UTC,"Yea it's everyone else's fault. The delusion is so strong in South Australia. So glad I left the economic backwater that it is. My only concern is for my family left there, wish they would buy a one way ticket out of there too."
Adelaide,3cmppm,peckerbrain,4,Thu Jul 9 06:00:04 2015 UTC,"Ouch, that's not a very nice thing to say. Perhaps instead of suggesting I'm deluded you could share some thoughts on the internal causes for the high unemployment rate and how they're of greater magnitude and significance than the external economic factors?   You mentioned the tafe training funding and the cuts to government expenditure. I agree cutting government funding isn't helping, but that's something that's happening throughout the whole nation and not just SA.   Note that I'm not suggesting there are no domestic factors at play, I'm just wondering why you feel they're so much more significant."
Adelaide,3cmppm,F4rsight,1 point,Thu Jul 9 06:10:54 2015 UTC,"We never said that... it's just an acknowledgement that there are elements outside of our control. A big problem in SA, both with governments, government departments, businesses, people, is that they only think within SA.  It's the parochial problem. There were industries that were competing with the guy down the road rather than the guy interstate or the guy overseas. The only way that thinking remains viable is with protectionist policies and eventually you're so far behind you get crushed.  I've seen it time and time again that anytime some nice little local thing gets done, everyone pats each other on the back and says job well done, completely ignoring the fact that noone outside of the state gives a shit or is affected by it. It happens in tourism, research, all sorts of shit.  You always have to keep outside forces and motions in mind because that's what you're competing against or trying to keep up with."
Adelaide,3cmppm,amgov,4,Thu Jul 9 06:16:57 2015 UTC,"So I was pretty freaked out by this at first like everyone else but a bit more reading into this it's not quite as bad as it sounds.   SA actually currently has a pretty high participation rate and the highest employment numbers for a couple of years. The big difference is that there are more people entering the workforce and looking for work now, which combined with some bigger job losses in parts of the state have forced up the Unemployment rate as job creation isn't matching the amount of people looking for work.   This isn't to say it isn't concerning, the fact that jobs aren't being created fast enough is pretty bad especially given most of the people entering the workforce are going to be young people. We are at risk of losing another generation to interstate, and the worst part is the fact that for the first time in god knows how long the majority of young people actually want to stay in Adelaide."
Adelaide,3cmppm,F4rsight,2,Thu Jul 9 13:35:23 2015 UTC,"We    The other concerning statistic is that the majority of jobs in South Australia are in ""health care and social assistance"" (so basically a lot of us are employed to take care of old and sick people). That's not sustainable, because old and sick people don't generate income or pay tax. That's probably why the state receives more GST income than it raises (in other words, we are dependent on the other states).  South Australia...the frail state."

But it will be at peak hour lunch time.   Thea tea house is all vegetarian food, asian style. It's good (I'm not vego or anything) and also the most peaceful spot in town I reckon. Nice lower level dining floor.   I agree with another guy, ULC is off of rundle and good food but not exactly quiet. If you get a table outside it can be good though.   Most of the places on Waymouth next to king William are nice and quiet if they're not packed, stuff like Press. Real good food but not cheap.   Does Gallery do food? Might be a choice - it's a rooftop bar. Never eaten there (if they do food) but it's away from the bustle of the city.   Oh, my favourite new place is Gondola Gondola. On the corner of Peel and Hindley. Amazing food, not cheap again, but a pretty nice atmosphere. Vietnamese mostly.   If you like thai food, on the other end of rundle mall, across Pulteney, is Sukhet Soi 38. Awesome thai food. And nice and quiet IF it's not busy. And I haven't seen it busy lately.   Good luck!"

Some events will be age restricted [15+ & 18+], so be sure to come along with some form of ID (or bring a parent / guardian)  All at the Adelaide Convention Centre (next weekend (17-19th July 2015)  This is NOT an event to be missed, come with your friends, tickets still available."
Adelaide,3cihev,throwawayaccount3665,2,Wed Jul 8 09:54:03 2015 UTC,"Hey, I hope you don't mind me asking, but do you know what the lolita turn out is looking like? My younger sister is interested in going to the lolita tea-party and I was wondering what that entailed, etc. Thanks!"
Adelaide,3cihev,HyperThanHype,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:29:43 2015 UTC,"Hi,  I have a question. For games like counter strike which is rated ma 15+, would someone need to bring I'd elven if they clearly look more than 15 (Ie. 21 year old needing id). It seems a bit silly that I need Id even though I have a full beard and can buy alcohol or cigarettes without being asked for Id."
Adelaide,3cihev,tommo_95,6,Wed Jul 8 12:25:33 2015 UTC,"I'm also staff in the games area specifically and yes, you'll be carded. It's a legal thing, not something we can control.   During the weekend we actually have plain clothes officers checking if we're doing it, and if not, the festival will be fined."
Adelaide,3cihev,DoctorDazza,2,Wed Jul 8 12:39:58 2015 UTC,That sucks majorly. I could understand if they looked younger than 15. I don't get the logic behind asking I'd from people who are clearly older than 15. I know it's not your fault but it's just dumb regulation.  Edit: please don't down vote him. If he is actually staff atleast he's giving the info. It's not his fault at all.
Adelaide,3cihev,tommo_95,3,Wed Jul 8 12:45:49 2015 UTC,You can get a wristband from the info desk so you can skip the ID stuff every single time.
Adelaide,3cihev,DoctorDazza,-9,Wed Jul 8 12:51:05 2015 UTC,Yay. Infantilising ourselves to save us from being hassled by the fun police.
Adelaide,3cihev,el_polar_bear,1 point,Wed Jul 8 13:14:26 2015 UTC,"It's mostly due to Australian regulations, as the games in the mature games area are pretty much all MA15+."
Adelaide,3cihev,bps87,2,Thu Jul 9 02:14:49 2015 UTC,"Hi tommo_95,  While It may be obvious to some people (just based on appearance) there will be a large range of all-ages at the event, and for this reason we ask that ID is present for all people entering age restricted areas.  The event will be controlled by our staff, volunteers, security and ACC staff, all of which may not necessarily know age limits until seeing some form of ID present.  To make life much easier on us as we process thousands of people in different areas, and for yourself to gain access to areas faster, it is for this simple reason that we ask to simply just bring along some form of ID, whether it be a drivers license, school ID, Uni/TAFE ID etc.  The main two (18+) events will be the StreetGeek gaming area (which will be blocked off by panels) and the afterdark DJ event (late on Saturday night, as we will do a sweep to move minors out, and the area becomes 18+ only.  We hope you can understand! Enjoy your time at AVcon. =)"
Adelaide,3cihev,throwawayaccount3665,1 point,Wed Jul 8 12:44:59 2015 UTC,Thanks for the info mate. Went last year and encountered some difficulties  (a friend forgot his I'd and lost his cool a bit). Just wanted to check to see if the regulations were similar this year.  You guys ran a great show last year and I'm sure it will be great again!
Adelaide,3cihev,tommo_95,1 point,Wed Jul 8 12:50:29 2015 UTC,"I'm from the StreetGeek LAN team, I just wanted to let people know that the StreetGeek LAN area is not 18+ only. It's 15+ only, as we play games that are MA15+."
Adelaide,3cihev,bps87,1 point,Thu Jul 9 02:13:14 2015 UTC,"Wait, where is the after dark DJ event this year? 2 years ago it was right next to our area (esports) and basically made our stuff undoable for a huge chunk of time, and everyone was pissed that this was happening."
Adelaide,3cihev,FXOfrequency,-3,Thu Jul 9 13:05:43 2015 UTC,"Yes, you'll be carded, because avcon staff and volunteers are mostly low functioning. Some obese woman in cat ears will have told all the volunteers strictly not to let anybody in who is under 15, which in the minds of the volunteers will parse as ""card literally everyone and use zero initiative""."
Adelaide,3cihev,milknondeiru,2,Fri Jul 10 14:35:03 2015 UTC,This will be my first convention and I'm pretty excited. Should I keep my expectations low?
Adelaide,3cihev,JustSmashh,3,Wed Jul 8 08:30:58 2015 UTC,"Depends what you are expecting to be honest.  If you are expecting a good social time with friends, a few panels you might be interested in, maybe a tournament, some good anime to watch, maybe some interesting gaming content to try out at the Indie Games Room - should be about on par.  If you're expecting some sort of psychedelic experience where everything is golden and the best thing ever - yeah, maybe aiming a bit too high.  But don't get me wrong, it's worth it. As long as you are somewhat interested in either anime or video games, there will be something you are interested in there, if anything just because there is so much stuff. Whether it's to play or to watch."
Adelaide,3cihev,JustSmashh,2,Wed Jul 8 09:00:40 2015 UTC,Yeah I'm not really expecting something that is super spectacular. I have a friend that may or may not be joining me but if he isn't able to make it I'm fine with going alone.
Adelaide,3cihev,TheApothecaryAus,2,Wed Jul 8 09:13:41 2015 UTC,"Do you like Anime, Do you like Video Games, Do you like people's insane effort and dedication making costumes that are related to both anime and video games.  If you said yes at any point, you'd probably like it at Avcon.  Just eat a big breakfast/lunch before you go, food is extra expensive. and/or walk into town to find something."
Adelaide,3cihev,JustSmashh,2,Thu Jul 9 00:09:01 2015 UTC,"Yes, yes, and yes. Alright I probably enjoy it to some degree haha"

If you like anime and that stuff then you should find it enjoyable, just dont expect it to be a life changing experience. And do expect to find lots of strange people and more smelly people"

Adelaide,3cihev,Lifteatsleepdrink,1 point,Thu Jul 9 13:03:39 2015 UTC,So I've never been to a con before. I wouldn't mind checking it out even if I am a bit old.  What day is the CSGO tourney on?
Adelaide,3cihev,bps87,3,Wed Jul 8 21:48:24 2015 UTC,"I'm a member of the StreetGeek LAN party team that runs the CS:GO and other PC LAN tournaments for AVCon. I've been doing it for 5 years and I've got some tips for you to make sure you enjoy the CS:GO and other tournaments:   For team tournaments, either having a partial team or full team will improve your chances. However, PUG's aren't always automatically out with a chance. PUG's have done very well and even won team tournaments before. If you do end up in a PUG, spend a few minutes talking to them about strategy and plan's, it helps a lot. Make sure you register as early as possible for the tournaments. CS:GO, TF2, Smash and other popular game tournaments fill up very fast. However, registration only opens a few hours before the tournament start, so ask if you are unsure of when to go Tournament registration all happens in one central point. It doesn't happen in the area that it will be happening in. There should be a huge ""Tournament Registration"" sign in the main game hall. Head over there. The PC LAN Tournaments are in the Mature 15+ area. You/your team will either need to be 15 or over or have a parent/guardian with you in order to enter and compete Get you/your team to be at the area that the tournament is happening at least 15-20 minutes before the tournament starts. If your name or team is called out to compete and you aren't there, you'll be disqualified.  Familiarize yourself with all tournament rules you plan on competing in and make sure to follow them. They can be found here: https://www.avcon.org.au/gaming/tournaments/tournament-rules/    If you have any other major questions, I would direct them to games@avcon.org.au"
Adelaide,3cihev,Lifteatsleepdrink,1 point,Thu Jul 9 02:11:21 2015 UTC,Thanks for the tips. No team here haha (I've played cs on/off for about 10 years and my friends are all console fifa junkies).    Just out of curiosity. Seeing as you can't bring your own peripherals what is the mouse/dpi supplied? (the biggest skill impact is this).  p.s Anyone here going to be participating in the CSGO?
Adelaide,3cihev,bps87,1 point,Fri Jul 10 00:07:27 2015 UTC,"AVCon's a non of profit, so I'm afraid the mouse and keyboard supplied aren't brilliant. They are Microsoft Wired Desktop 600 kits (http://www.theverge.com/products/wired-desktop-600/3959). The mice are 800 DPI mice. While not great, every PC is equipped with them so if there is a handicap, every single person has the same handicap so it's a level playing field."
Adelaide,3cihev,Lifteatsleepdrink,1 point,Fri Jul 10 02:03:42 2015 UTC,Honestly thats fine. In fact its only a handicap if youre not aware (and an edge if you are). The only reason I ask is so you know what sensitivity to set it at as soon as you sit down.  Wouldn't matter so much with lower level players that spray/use smgs but when youre trying to find someones head your muscle memory of how much to move the mouse is a pain to fight against
Adelaide,3cihev,bps87,1 point,Fri Jul 10 02:13:35 2015 UTC,"Agreed. We've been trying to source a way of providing better gaming peripherals for a while, but we've had no luck with either finding something we can get for 40x PC's either cheaply or sponsored."
Adelaide,3cihev,Lifteatsleepdrink,2,Fri Jul 10 02:48:57 2015 UTC,Looks like it's going to be Saturday 11:30  https://www.avcon.org.au/gaming/games-schedule/  Make sure to either bring 4 friends or be prepared to get put into PUG teams...last year I went in and got into a PUG team of 4 under 15s who didn't know what Dust 2 was as a map. It was pretty hilariously bad.

Adelaide,3ci8xa,Ezzburr,29,Wed Jul 8 02:54:54 2015 UTC,All I want back is the French Vanilla Cappuccino one!
Adelaide,3ci8xa,chainsaw_abortion,3,Wed Jul 8 04:01:45 2015 UTC,"I reckon I saw that at Vili's about 12 months ago. Not sure if it's still there, but they did seem to have it after it was gone from everywhere else, so might be worth checking?"
Adelaide,3ci8xa,Aardvark_Man,5,Wed Jul 8 04:16:19 2015 UTC,"It got discontinued around 5 months ago! But I did a little sleuthing and found a video where a representative from Pura called some guy who is behind the whole ""bring back the classic milk"" campaign and he said that they're bringing French Vanilla Cappuccino back! Hoorah!"
Adelaide,3ci8xa,chainsaw_abortion,3,Wed Jul 8 04:18:43 2015 UTC,I believe they have a few flavours that are constant and a few on rotation. french vanilla (the best one ever) is on that rotation along with ones like malt (maybe banana?).
Adelaide,3ci8xa,Annies_Boobs_,2,Wed Jul 8 06:09:20 2015 UTC,From what I've learnt apparently they brought in vanilla malt to replace French vanilla cappuccino? I am not too sure it's on the Facebook page but regardless - IT'S COMING BACK!!! Yeah!!!

Adelaide,3ci8xa,ezzatron,1 point,Thu Jul 9 00:37:48 2015 UTC,Thank you for the detective work. That news has made my week. I think the only reason they keep discontinuing it is to bring it back to much elation.
Adelaide,3ci8xa,Bro-LoElCunado,5,Wed Jul 8 04:58:25 2015 UTC,"If this is true, my wife is going to be ecstatic!  She complained to FU about the flavour change and was invited to be part of one of their focus groups last year.  Not a single person who was in her group liked the new taste."
Adelaide,3ci8xa,PhotographsWithFilm,1 point,Wed Jul 8 04:04:07 2015 UTC,"Me too, I look forward to having one every time I visit SA & the last time was very disappointing."
Adelaide,3ci8xa,mutantruby,6,Wed Jul 8 05:11:35 2015 UTC,"Can confirm, they're reverting back to the old flavours.  A friend of a friend ran the Facebook campaign. He put up a video of the phone call he got from the company when they made the decision to return to the original recipe, which is here.  They've kept the new design but the new message on the side is different and reads:   A true classic always delivers. Fresh milk & simple ingredients for that irresistible smooth & creamy taste, made in SA since 1987. That's the classic way   And yes, French Vanilla Cappuccino is coming back."
Adelaide,3ci8xa,BlokeDownUnder,4,Wed Jul 8 14:01:19 2015 UTC,Where's the goddamn french vanilla cappuccino

Adelaide,3ci8xa,TheMagicSack,3,Fri Jul 10 13:00:57 2015 UTC,"Yes it's true. If you look at the ingredients it's the old BETTER tasting recipe (artificial colours and flavours). They started producing a few weeks ago, so old stock should be sold by now. Oh and they are planning on bringing back Vanilla in the near future. I have to admit I wrote to pura about 10 times upset about the coffee and choc. Glad we got the result we wanted! :D"

Adelaide,3ci8xa,peterwilliams83,2,Wed Jul 8 06:59:23 2015 UTC,"It's true. I saw they'd removed the 'no artificial flavours' label from the carton, so I sent them an email to confirm. I didn't want to spend another $5 just to tip it down the sink! This was their response:  Since launching the new PURA Classic flavours in November 2014, we have received feedback from a number of people who told us they preferred the original Classic flavours.   We are delighted to confirm that flavours Chocolate, Banana, Strawberry, Iced Coffee and Mocha will be back on shelf in leading South Australia  retailers by early July 2015.  Once again, thank you for contacting Lion."

Adelaide,3ci8xa,hellboy1975,1 point,Wed Jul 8 03:10:56 2015 UTC,Awhile ago they changed the recipe of classic chocolate milk as well as a couple of their other flavours. Rumour has it they changed it back. I'm yet to confirm it.
Adelaide,3ci8xa,28828383,3,Wed Jul 8 03:26:04 2015 UTC,"I've never noticed the difference to be honest, but others are convinced there's a significant one.  I'd like to try a blind taste on the two to see if the complaints are warranted."
Adelaide,3ci8xa,hellboy1975,2,Wed Jul 8 06:29:51 2015 UTC,"Well how often did you drink them? I used to have a flavoured milk every day at work. Mocha being a favourite of mine. When you consume at least one every single day for years, a change in recipe is real bloody noticeable. I possibly even had an addiction, yes ""had"". I stopped drinking the classic milks after the change. I may be bothered to purchase them again, if they are back to the original. However after breaking the addiction, it's been a money saver, and healthier!"
Adelaide,3ci8xa,rainbowplethora,1 point,Wed Jul 8 12:29:37 2015 UTC,"Not frequently enough to tell the difference, that's for sure!"

Only thing I can think of is go to an internet cafe (eg there's some around chinatown) and chat with the staff about it.   Or head to internode offices in the city or adam offices, and just ask if you can download this one file, pretend you're interested in getting internet, point out you're willing to pay, etc etc.  Do you not have internet at home, or at work?

Adelaide,3cijft,lileyedmonster,2,Wed Jul 8 04:32:00 2015 UTC,Store assistant here. What brand are they?
Adelaide,3cijft,mx1a,3,Wed Jul 8 13:51:21 2015 UTC,Stephs kicks are Underarmour.  OP you should be able to find a Curry jersey in most sports stores.
Adelaide,3cijft,abuch47,2,Thu Jul 9 09:35:23 2015 UTC,Under armor is now exclusive to rebel in adelaide. Thats what I was told when we couldnt stock it anymore.
Adelaide,3cijft,mx1a,3,Thu Jul 9 10:39:34 2015 UTC,The shoes are underarmour and the jersey/shorts will be Adidas. Thanks for the info.
Adelaide,3cijft,abuch47,2,Thu Jul 9 11:07:18 2015 UTC,Almost any store that stocks adidas should be able to order those in. The chain I work for.. sports power.. can if you head into one of our stores.

Adelaide,3cf5gh,AussieITE,4,Thu Jul 16 13:32:58 2015 UTC,"I don't know if it would have been easier (and possibly quicker) if I was physically in Adelaide but it took me over two years to land a job.  But I guess I was only really applying to jobs that were relevant to my field (civil engineering). The problem that I had was simply that no one was hiring. Even then, the jobs that were being advertised weren't really my forte. I'm lucky that the job I did get was one that I am actually suited to. It just took two years to turn up."
Adelaide,3cf5gh,Reavus,4,Tue Jul 7 22:29:25 2015 UTC,"I work in a pretty niche role and from what I've seen (I'm vaguely looking for new work) there are jobs out there, about as many as you would expect for the kind of work I'm in, BUT there are heaps of applicants for them.  On the other side of the coin, my company actually finds it difficult to get good quality staff for our call centre and sales teams. The jobs are there (although not in call centre at the moment) but the staff are just lacking, not skilled enough or not dependable. So maybe it is more to do with a mismatch between the skills available in the unemployment pool vs the skills desired by employers, more than anything. (That's not to say that the people who are unemployed aren't skilled enough. It means the skills they have aren't the skills being hired for at the moment.)"
Adelaide,3cf5gh,luckiest_wasp,3,Wed Jul 8 01:51:18 2015 UTC,"My mum gave up working as a nurse because so many nursing homes are ""restructuring"" and only leaving a skeleton crew of staff. She worked at the same nursing home for close to 30 years and by the end they treated her so bad she had to leave."
Adelaide,3cf5gh,6APe9,2,Wed Jul 8 02:14:38 2015 UTC,"The biggest difference between the job market here and the Eastern seaboard in my field is that it is not at all fluid. In Sydney and Melbourne people can afford to job-hop. Here, the experienced people tend to get jobs and hold onto them, because it can take a long time to find something suitable. I'm not surprised to hear of people in Adelaide looking for 2 years for a job that fits their skill-set, especially if it's a niche industry.  If you're looking for a job in a niche you might be best served getting something to make ends meet in the short term and keeping an eye on the job market until your dream job turns up."
Adelaide,3cf5gh,pmam,2,Wed Jul 8 02:07:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah, i think its bad in some instances, but its what you make of it. Jobs are around, but i guess people just blanket apply to everything at the moment, and when they do land something they end up being unreliable.  Im in IT, and there is such a lack of good talent in the marketplace that companies are now looking interstate/overseas to get staff. But i deal with many companies that dont use employment agencies as they dont offer any benefit to the company (other than charge a fee) they dont even filter people, just basically pass on a resume. In fact we just help close down and employment agency that had over 100 staff.....  There are plenty of jobs if you dont mind looking or asking people in the respective industries. Get Networking, attend seminars, online forums (LinkedIn has a lot), keep going back to career pages on companies websites and meet as many people as you can.  I know there are jobs that are niche, that dont require much than being reliable that have plenty of on the job training that are not in the retail or food industry. Try looking at Hospital orderlies, customer service, medical records etc, Heaps of Cabling jobs for Network & AV (which can give you a trade as well), Audio techs (have a music interest) and tour guides.....   Heres some links for networking:  http://www.adelaidecitycouncil.com/city-business/growing-your-business/networking-events/ http://awom.com.au/  Reference: I moved to Adelaide 8 Years ago, and have never applied for a Job, just got to know people and they often approach me."
Adelaide,3cf5gh,MrSniper911,2,Wed Jul 8 05:09:09 2015 UTC,"I've been incredibly fortunate with work. I'm a full time student and I currently have 3 casual jobs.   The area that I'm studying is very much a niche. There are 12 people in most of my 3rd year subjects, with around 50-60 over the 5 years (Bachelors and Post-Grad combined). Through networking at an event I was able to get casual work in the field that I'm studying. Around 15ish of the 50-60 students are employed by this company as casuals, with another 10ish now full time employees after having been through the study route that I'm doing.  I also have a casual sales job which I picked up through a family friend. It's largely over the summer, (Sept - Feb), although I do get the odd shift during the year. This coming summer will be my third.   I picked this job up simply because I knew another person who worked there. They put in a good word for myself and one of my mates who also works as a casual.   My 3rd job is in a bulk goods retail shop, stacking shelves. I've been here for just over a year. Before I got this job I had been applying for around 6 months looking for a casual retail position. I was looking multiple times per day and applying for everything that I liked the look of (5-10 applications a week). Most of these applications received no reply.     I have previously worked at Coles. I resigned at the end of 2014.   There are definitely jobs out there if you are persistent in looking. My experience is that a large majority of jobs aren't advertised, it becomes a matter of who you know.   Persistence and networking are definitely the key!   Edit: Formatting"
Adelaide,3cf5gh,SouthAussie94,3,Wed Jul 8 08:37:29 2015 UTC,"Moved to Adelaide from sydney 3 months ago to help out my sister  who's struggling to raise a family as a single mum. I'm an experienced manufacturing supervisor and retail manager so I thought I'd piss in a job after a couple of weeks.   So wrong.   Job market in Adelaide is rough. Took me 2 months to get anything... and that was just some shifty coles casual work. Luckily I started a full time manufacturing job on Monday so I got what I wanted in the end. My biggest issue was a lack of a car. You can get away with that in Sydney because the public transport system is so good, not so much in Adelaide.   Though in the end I got the job that I wanted. In the industry that I wanted. It's just a case of never giving up. Apply for every job you can until you get something. Then keep applying for jobs till you get something you want. There's always work around if you're prepared to do anything."

To be fair, we knew it wouldn't be easy here and I'm in international qualification limbo. But I graduated in the U.S. in the mid-2000's into a shitstorm and finally got here just in time for this one. It's annoying, but we're grateful for my partner's job. Hopefully my qualifications move once I've got them. SA has its charms, but the job market isn't one. We love it here, and adelaide is amazing, but we love to be able to eat more."

Adelaide,3camol,clockwerx,4,Mon Jul 6 15:17:26 2015 UTC,"Interesting, it's like the Uber wars of the past:  ""From 1915 onwards the MTT had to compete against unregulated private buses, often preceding the trams on the same route to steal fares, which the MTT countered by opening their own motor bus routes from 1925.[69] The South Australian government began regulating buses within the state in 1927, although some private operators used a provision in the Australian constitution to their advantage. By notionally marking each ticket as a fare from the pickup point to Murrayville, Victoria (but allowing passengers to board or alight sooner) companies avoided having to abide by the regulation for some time."""

I hated the idea until I saw how many people in the city used them, and this was before the line really went anywhere. Forced me to do a total 180. We spend billions on roads, and I actually think our road network is in good shape. I see heaps getting spent on even minor roads that could go another 10 years without work without really causing any big problems. Diverting half a billion a year to light rail could do this city no harm."
Adelaide,3camol,el_polar_bear,3,Tue Jul 7 02:32:57 2015 UTC,Most of the roads are okay but the South Road Arterial needs to be completed ASAP.

Adelaide,3camol,el_polar_bear,2,Tue Jul 7 03:55:30 2015 UTC,Yeah I'm looking forward to that project being complete. I agree with you about West Terrace. Something has to be done about the Anzac/South Tce/Goodwood Rd intersection to make it flow better.

They don't have the advantages of either.  Why are we investing more in fucking trams?  Is it just cause Melbourne still has a lot, cause that's all I can think of."
Adelaide,3camol,Aardvark_Man,3,Tue Jul 7 01:11:28 2015 UTC,Because they quickly and cheaply move lots of people from A to B without them having to divert from where they'd have to walk anyway.
Adelaide,3camol,el_polar_bear,0,Tue Jul 7 04:35:37 2015 UTC,"Unlike buses?    I just don't see how it's more effective than a bus, especially considering you've gotta lay the tracks etc.  Both are still subject to traffic etc still."
Adelaide,3camol,Aardvark_Man,7,Tue Jul 7 04:43:14 2015 UTC,"Rail wheels have point-contact with the ground. Trams have only an electric motor - no heavy diesel engine - which instantly reaches full torque.  With the electricity supply overhead, they need carry only a relatively small capacitor bank instead of fuel. This makes the vehicle much lighter by itself, so for relatively slow, baby rail like a tramway, lets you get away with making the bogey itself, and the rails it runs on much lighter too.  These points make rail, in theory, the most fuel efficient way of moving cargo on the planet. In practice, busses are usually on-par, and sometimes better, depending on how good your network is.  If you compared how, say, Tokyo moves people with how Los Angeles gets it done, and what it costs them in dollars, infrastructure, and real-estate, I'll bet you anything Japan does way more with less.  Most whole-of-system studies find that the most efficient network (typically for freight) is a combination of rail for long-haul, combined with road transport for the last-miles. Since most people have legs and can be relied upon to walk a few hundred metres to the tramline, light rail makes a lot of sense for the most passenger-intensive corridors.   You're still never going to displace the buses, especially in a city as sprawled as ours, so adding trams is not an either-or prospect, but having a line run along each of the major transport conduits so you can get into the city, and crucially, back out again with minimum layover and fuss while changing vehicles (if at all) is very attractive for someone planning to get the bills paid. The capital investment is high, but once it's done, you can move so many more people."

Adelaide,3camol,Dinnym,-9,Tue Jul 7 00:44:15 2015 UTC,"It just takes to much of the road up, more traffic for cars. The trams are practically empty most the times anyway"
Adelaide,3camol,Thanks12321,7,Tue Jul 7 01:14:43 2015 UTC,"A tram displaces maybe 8 cars at a time, while carrying anywhere between 100% to 2000% as many passengers. You're getting downvoted because you're thinking with flawed theory. Adding more lanes only slightly increases the carrying capacity of any given road. The most important thing is passenger density and smooth flow."
Adelaide,3camol,el_polar_bear,-9,Tue Jul 7 02:44:16 2015 UTC,"I'm just commenting from my point of view, I don't use a team regularly like most people so it dosent benefit me, they should get rid of the tracks and make another lane so I can get around easier"

Adelaide,3camol,bam_stroker,2,Tue Jul 7 04:54:56 2015 UTC,"The trams are full during peak hour, which is the time that the most cars are on the road. They're actually making more room for cars."
Adelaide,3camol,UnicornPenguinCat,-1,Tue Jul 7 13:27:23 2015 UTC,"You could easily make were that track is a bus only lane between peek hours, so all the other hours there would be less trafic even during non peak hours,"
Adelaide,3camol,Thanks12321,1 point,Tue Jul 7 14:51:14 2015 UTC,"Most of the time they're not on the road though; that's only in the city and down near Glenelg.  Same effect though; a bunch of people not using cars, meaning less congestion for those that are..."
Adelaide,3camol,UnicornPenguinCat,-1,Wed Jul 8 04:18:06 2015 UTC,"Since I don't use the tram, the way I see it is that it could be super highway to go to the city to Glenelg quickly."
Adelaide,3camol,Thanks12321,2,Wed Jul 8 06:57:12 2015 UTC,"It already is, you just have to jump on the tram. If it was a road, it would become clogged up with cars in peak hour."
Adelaide,3camol,UnicornPenguinCat,-1,Wed Jul 8 12:00:05 2015 UTC,"But there is still the other roads to take during peak hours, taking the tram from city to Glenelg takes forever when u have to make every stop, in a car with no stops or trafic lights would take 5-10 minutes."
Adelaide,3camol,Thanks12321,2,Wed Jul 8 13:04:27 2015 UTC,"But that's the thing though, in a car you would still have to stop. Traffic on roads crossing the tram line/theoretical new road would still need to get through, so you would have to stop for red lights which would result in cars bunching up and eventual congestion. It wouldn't be much different to adding another lane to the route that already exists from the city to Glenelg (Anzac highway).   Trains and trams (generally/always?) get right of way at intersections, but trams and trains are ""discrete"" forms of traffic, i.e all the traffic (passengers on the tram/train) goes through an intersection in one go, then the intersection can be re-opened. Conversely, on a road during peak hour you have a continuous stream of traffic - and you can't give any one road continuous right of way without stopping the flow on all roads crossing it; which would obviously create massive traffic delays elsewhere.   If you were the only car (or one of very few) on the theoretical road replacing the tram line (and the boom gates and bells operated for you every time you were approaching an intersection so you never had to stop) then yes, it would be very quick."
Adelaide,3camol,UnicornPenguinCat,2,Wed Jul 8 13:52:11 2015 UTC,"They might be mostly empty during off-peak periods (hence the name) but during peak hour each full tram represents about 120 cars that aren't on the road trying to get in and out of the CBD every morning and afternoon.  Consider that during peak hour there's several trams an hour and the number of cars it removes from the CBD and arterial roads leading to it is significant.  Removing trams will make a some extra room for cars, yes, but it will also add vastly more cars back in to the mix."

It'd be pretty easy to fall into a situation of reliance on your top selling product in that situation. But I have no experience with it so I'm only guessing.  I'm not sure the video store example is all that strong - that was a case of an entire media/content delivery format becoming obsolete due to technological changes.

Adelaide,3can3b,basefield,1 point,Mon Jul 6 23:46:18 2015 UTC,"If we're being cynical it's probably more accurate to say he jumped on to defend the 'little guy' rather than for the free trip - it gets a story in the news and maintains his public image as the 'good politician' with the voters. Xenophon has been very good at it for years, otherwise he wouldn't be so well known in SA. Cynics have been arguing that's why he does all these little stunts for years.  On the other hand helping someone out like this isn't exactly an ignoble thing to do, given he may be able to provide them with some real help in this situation (experience with negotiations, political presence adds credibility to their argument).   He's probably the only one that will ever know if he does this stuff for the right reasons or not. I try to be an optimist about this sort of thing myself, as hard as it might be."

Adelaide,3c8sbh,doggoesmeow,2,Sun Jul 5 23:37:12 2015 UTC,"A reference is a piece of text written about you on your behalf.  A referee is someone who is prepared to answer questions about you, usually via a phone call.  OP, be aware of the difference and know whether you want someone to write you a reference, be a referee, or both. If you are trying to get a first job post-graduation you might want them to do both.  If you've already got a strong resume you might only want them to be prepared to be a referee."

Adelaide,3c21nh,ksg1,1 point,Sat Jul 4 02:46:56 2015 UTC,"The one exchange I had was when my parents were nearly jailed, and FSA had all of my siblings medical records sealed from them, all from a false accusation where no research in the matter was conducted.    Nearly ruined my family so yeah, not a fan."
Adelaide,3c21nh,Dylando_Calrissian,9,Sat Jul 4 05:36:20 2015 UTC,"Both my parents have worked for Families SA (both have left).  They found it to be a soul-crushing and highly stressful work environment. The case load was so high that no case got the attention required to make a reasonable decision. Everyone who actually cares burns out, and those who remain are the people who can't escape to a better job."
Adelaide,3c21nh,Veganpuncher,0,Sat Jul 4 06:36:11 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Case load is enormous, there are so many legal checks on taking meaningful action that the practitioners quickly go out of their minds. It's the same when you work in any organisation that deals with society's losers (Police, Centrelink, ED at Lyell McEwin) : you can't really help them, all you can do is give them a band aid and wait for them to fuck up again.  There was a show many years ago called '7 Up' - it took a group of seven year olds and talked about their lives. Seven years later it was '14 Up' - same kids, same idea. I'm not sure how far it got but it was fascinating. The premise was that people are essentially 'formed' by the time they're seven, after that, it's just a process. Working at Families SA seems to be like watching a slow-motion train wreck. You know what's going to happen, but you can't do anything about it because all the damage was done in the first few years of the kids' lives."
Adelaide,3c21nh,ScooberSteve,5,Wed Jul 8 06:50:21 2015 UTC,"I worked for FSA for nearly 3 years before moving over to a non government organization.  I was a support worker, there are two sides to the way FSA worked at the time (probably still is) intake and guardianship teams. They both work completely different and one is less stressful and soul crushing than the other.  Intake teams are the people that handle the reports and investigations. A lot of offices are under-staffed when it comes to intake teams. I.e. At Elizabeth DC they don't get any report lower than a Category 3 from the child abuse report line (CARL). BTW Cat 3 is the highest category there is.   This is the work I hated the most, and the hardest thing I found working in the intake teams was the social workers tried to save as much face with the parents while their children were on intrim orders (temporary foster care) until they were reunified with their parents or given GOM18 orders. Social workers in these teams would get the support workers to do most of the face to face stuff with the parents. Some parents had to ring and confirm that they would be attending access with their child, this is usually either ordered by the courts or due to the fact they would constantly not show up to access. Some of these parents would refuse to contact the office to confirm they are attending, show up and then start yelling at the front counter staff when they get informed that access had been canceled due to their actions. The social workers I worked with would send their support workers out to talk to them face to face so we became to face of all their problems and it got so bad with me with one case dealing with an aboriginal family that I left FSA and went into a non government aboriginal organization where my first client encounter was with this same family however my dealing with them there was completely the opposite to dealing with them at FSA.  Now the otherside of the coin is the guardinship teams, these teams get cases handed to them from the intake team once they have been given a GOM18 order (Guardianship Of the Minister until 18). The way things work is completely different the parents of the children know that they aren't getting their child(ren) back, they generally show up for access and they follow the rules set out by their social worker. As a support worker I don't think I even was abused by a parent while I was in that team, when I moved over to Intake it was all day every day."
Adelaide,3c21nh,firestorm91,4,Sat Jul 4 20:18:10 2015 UTC,"The GOM teams do not surprise me, I've met a few children who are GOM and they tend to go across the entire spectrum from amazing to difficult."
Adelaide,3c21nh,ScooberSteve,2,Sun Jul 5 06:43:29 2015 UTC,"Almost everything is in place before the GOM teams even get the case handed over to them. Think of a case like a car, the Intake team is the factory building the case, putting programs, accommodation, school, medical, parental, access into place. The GOM team is the owner of the new car, it's all routine maintainance on the case, and unless shit hits the fan there isn't much the social worker has to do."
Adelaide,3c21nh,insanopointless,4,Sun Jul 5 08:02:40 2015 UTC,"Not sure on the internal workings, not my beat. I thought this was a good write up by InDaily... interview with some of them."
Adelaide,3c21nh,LastChance22,4,Sat Jul 4 04:18:41 2015 UTC,"Like another commenter, both my parents worked with or for them. Some key words they've used are tough, drastically underfunded, and filled with burnt out people. From what they've said, it seems to me like problems are often side-stepped rather than dealt with, and its easier to move someone who is under-performing or doesnt give a shit than to fire them, so that happens a lot.  There isnt enough money to provide adequate care which is often heartbreaking, wanting to help and being there to help but then looking and seeing there is no room in the system. But even if it was better funded, it has internal issues that would need to be addressed that come down to office politics and working in the public sector. I'm against making it easier than it currently is to fire employees, but its cases like this where it seems like it would be useful, to remove the people who no longer give a shit."

A few of the more naïve ones seem to enjoy the work and feel like they're making a difference. My mother hated being a practitioner and worked her way into management as quickly as she could, just so she could be out of the more harmful areas of FSA.  She has said one thing repetively though: Once you work for FSA, you're stuck in FSA for good."

There's UNISAGA (UniSA Gamers Association) for UniSA, EVAC (Extremely versatile acronym club) for University of Adelaide, and FUDGE (Flinders University Digital Gaming Enthusiasts) for Flinders University.   Gaming events - by far the largest is AVCon, the Adelaide Anime and Videogames Convention, which is coming up soon on the 17th-19th of July at the Adelaide Convention Centre. Tickets sound expensive at $65, but that includes almost everything (except for food, drink and merchandise) in the ticket price, and it offers a lot more to see and do than any of the other conventions in Adelaide by a mile.

Adelaide,3c1r0i,jamds,1 point,Sat Jul 4 05:14:18 2015 UTC,"Couple of things from a man who owes a considerable amount in parking fines to Adelaide City Council. It goes something like this -    Fine Reminder notice Final reminder notce Referral to Fines Payment Unit Reminder notice Final reminder notice Restrictions on license and blocked from doing business with SA Transport authorities. Many more reminder notices   Final note: The Fines Payment Unit no longer refers you to the Magistrates Court if you fail to pay.  This was a loop hole many used because Judges would rarely force you to pay the bill, frequently reduce the fines, or order the penalty changed to community service."

Adelaide,3bx5fk,the_khajiit_of_lies,1 point,Thu Jul 2 23:24:10 2015 UTC,"Irrelevant. You don't get to call someone murderer with impunity until they're convicted. Based on news reports even last night, the accused is unable to instruct his lawyer, which strongly suggests psychosis or other serious mental illness. The police have charged him, but that's a formality even if everyone involved agrees he's completely cuckoo-bananas. Only at commital or trial can he plead, be convicted, acquitted, or excused from standing trial due to his mental condition, and it's important that that process be allowed to happen one way or the others.  In extreme cases of trial-by-media, it is actually possible for a court to have to let an obviously guilty person go because they're unable to give them a fair trial. It's unusual, but it can and has happened."

Adelaide,3bx5fk,timbojj,2,Fri Jul 3 17:47:19 2015 UTC,"Not exactly. The police will obtain the medical notes under a warrant or subpoena then eventually submit them to the court. Once they're presented in an open court they become public record, unless the judge specifically makes a suppression order. So it's kinda the other way around."
Adelaide,3bx5fk,el_polar_bear,2,Sun Jul 5 04:54:00 2015 UTC,Okay. Subpoena still needs to be signed by a judge though?
Adelaide,3bx5fk,timbojj,2,Mon Jul 6 00:28:23 2015 UTC,"A subpoena, yes. But all detectives in SA have a 'general search warrant' that is issued to them personally. So at any time they can just go and get the records if they may form evidence of an indictable offence."

That's rubbish. As humans we always feel more about things and people that we can relate to, and that gets amplified when you either actively follow someone (or idolise someone). I'm aware that people are murdered everyday but it doesn't usually affect me until I either know or had previously acknowledged the existence of that person.   Really though, it doesn't matter. Let OP grieve however he chooses. RIP Phil."
Adelaide,3bx5fk,oliyoung,-9,Fri Jul 3 01:25:46 2015 UTC,"My point is by saying 'as a crows fan' or 'as a footy fan' you belittle the person in question by reducing who they were to nothing but a footy celebrity. It implies, intentional or otherwise, that the only reason you care is because he was involved in football, not because he was a human being.  While that might be the case, let's not be proud of that."
Adelaide,3bx5fk,MisuVir,7,Fri Jul 3 01:35:58 2015 UTC,"Huh, I don't get that vibe. Seeing as this is still breaking news, paired OP's all-caps post title and ""what the fuck"" in post, I don't really see fault in their reaction. This is breaking news, and everyone will react differently - which in hindsight may not be the most courteous, but I don't feel it's right to dictate how people should or shouldn't react. I'm sure, like you mentioned, that it wasn't intentional."
Adelaide,3bx5fk,AdamDaze,4,Fri Jul 3 01:42:46 2015 UTC,"the only reason you care    no. the only reason OP cares THIS much is because of a greater connection they have with their club and their sport.   See, to me personally, this is yet another devastating chapter in a horrific domestic violence issue Australia is not dealing with, but I'm not a Crows fan, or even an AFL fan.   Adding a personal and intimate relationship with a club and a community … man … i don't even know.   Grief is grief, don't judge it, let it be."

Adelaide,3bvhpt,touring123,1 point,Fri Jul 3 02:35:59 2015 UTC,"That photo would have been taken of a still frame for publicity purposes.

I managed to get a heap of acceptable shots that way."
Adelaide,3bvmyn,ThaPenguinFace,11,Thu Jul 2 14:57:31 2015 UTC,"Having visited Sydney a few times and lived in Adelaide my whole life, the biggest difference I could see was that Adelaide is more relaxed. Our population is significantly smaller, so walking along city streets you're less likely to get bumped into.  The streets of the city are well planned however there are city events that create some traffic problems, namely the Fringe and Clipsal 500.  We've got a reasonably large busking scene that tends to stick around the recently renovated Rundle Mall. The mall itself is for pedestrians only, from the middle you can walk to a dozen food courts within minutes.  Public transport reliability varies depending on where you're going - in my opinion it's slightly better to the north-east than to the south. There's a Metro Card - the standard one gives you two hours of travel per swipe (free re-swipes within that time window). Within the city there are free busses and a free tram service that stops being free south of the CBD.  I don't find there's a lot to do in the Adelaide CBD other than food and drinks, but I don't mind that (it's a tirelessly repeated complaint). I play video games or go camping for adventure.  Hope your move goes well, best of luck settling in."
Adelaide,3bvmyn,R3P1N5,6,Thu Jul 2 22:57:33 2015 UTC,"If you are living near the CBD, try to attend uni at UNISA or Adelaide Uni. Depending what you are wanting to do, one will be better than the other for that kind of study.  CBD will be apartment, but just on the outskirts you will be able to get a place and public transport is easy enough to travel in when needed.    Depending on budget, you can head towards the beach also which is perfect coming into summer.   Food and drink hunt around, not too far away from a local place you can enjoy.  Its called a Parmy here, your wrong. Buy a pint. Farmers Union Iced Coffee.  Enjoy."
Adelaide,3bvmyn,Banter_Explorer,5,Thu Jul 2 22:42:08 2015 UTC,"Watch your speed. On a road in Sydney with a limit of 80 and a general flow of 90, the same road here would be signposted 60. Some old lady is going 50 and a beaten up falcon keeps changing lanes trying to pass. There is a hidden speed camera on the only safe smooth stretch. Next traffic lights the major arterial road stops 120 vehicles to let two cars in from a side street.  It then takes 2km of driving to build up to 50 again. Someone tried to change lanes in front of the falcon and now he's royally pissed, driving up close to their bumper and beeping the horn. Old lady wants to turn right into a side street and it's perfectly legit to just stop in the middle of the road to wait for an opening. Traffic on the other side is heavy, one car stops to let the lady across but another one doesn't, leaving her stuck in the middle across the other side of the road where yet another beaten up falcon is yelling obscenities. Finally someone else leaves a gap for her to finish cutting across but the old lady hasn't noticed and still just sits there. Finally she gets across and angry guy does a wheelspin only to slam his brakes on because traffic is at a standstill again to let another car in from a sidestreet."

Adelaide,3bvmyn,immrmessy,2,Fri Jul 3 02:13:18 2015 UTC,"Haha, I get the impression that drivers suck no matter where you are - the drivers in Sydney are just... shudders... mentally scarring. It's almost like there's a sign on my car that says ""PLEASE OVERTAKE ME... AND THEN SLAM ON YOUR BRAKES!""  But yeah, I generally prefer walking anyway, I just get angry driving around the city. Motorcycles are much more fun on a nice, windy road :D"
Adelaide,3bvmyn,firestorm91,1 point,Fri Jul 3 04:20:58 2015 UTC,"As someone who's done the opposite (from what you're doing-I've lived in Adelaide my whole life, am now living in Sydney), I can agree. Adelaide drivers just seem to believe that the indicator is optional and that the right lane is the ""slow"" lane. Sydney drivers are crazy...you'd think that with more hours and rules for gettig your full licence over there they'd be better drivers. Nope-they're crazy!  (This is pretty much the main reason why my partner will do any driving in Sydney when we need to rent a car from goget. If we're in Adelaide though, I will do the driving. It's not because I'm a sucky driver, it's because my anxiety + crazy drivers in Sydney = HELP!)"
Adelaide,3bvmyn,UnicornPenguinCat,1 point,Sat Jul 4 08:07:19 2015 UTC,"It's probably easier on a motorcycle, but if you're driving a car in Adelaide and you want to change lanes, generally the best strategy is to only indicate just before you start to move across. Any more warning than that and the person in the lane you're changing into is likely to speed up and try to block you from changing (I have no idea why people do this, but it's pretty common).   Also, if you're at an intersection turning left, keep a really close eye on people turning right across the traffic... sometimes they don't seem to register that you're there, and if the street you're both turning into only has one lane, trouble may ensue."

Adelaide,3bvmyn,Eggmont,3,Thu Jul 2 17:06:38 2015 UTC,"I moved to Adelaide ~11 months ago from Hobart and my experience has been great so far. As someone who's travelled Aus and the world a reasonable amount I always thought I'd go for somewhere like Sydney or Melbourne, but I've really grown to like Adelaide.  FWIW on top of the Adelaide FAQs, comments, and other stuff you might find around the web, here are a couple of points that stood out for me:   Adelaide drivers are terrible, believe everything you read. Be careful on your motorcycle around the suburbs. One particular thing that really jumped out at me was the fact that when people are turning right across traffic, they sometimes turn when you're uncomfortably close. I imagine it's because a large number of suburban roads are two lanes and 60kph, therefore traffic travels closely, therefore you can sometimes be waiting forever to turn right. All the best things in Adelaide aren't all laid out in plain sight. The cafes, restaurants, shops, sights, etc that I've enjoyed the most are hidden in shopping arcades, laneways, little suburban pockets, side streets, or I found them by word of mouth. Go explore and try new places/things. Pick a football team. There are only two. ;) The first thing you should do is go to the top of Mount Lofty and get a sense for how amazingly flat and expansive (and leafy) Adelaide is.    Enjoy the move!"

Adelaide,3bvmyn,Sataah1,2,Fri Jul 3 04:23:27 2015 UTC,"As someone who's done the opposite, I will give you some points of advice:   -If you need to do your rego for your motorcycle, I would AVOID the rego office as much as possible. Only go there if you can't do it online. Sydney's system is about 10x more efficient than Adelaide's. Adelaide's is full of people who don't trust online websites. You can do it online or at the post office (the latter is MUCH quicker).   -To get around on the buses in Adelaide, you'll need a metrocard. They can be picked up from most newsagents and such and are also the place to top them up. Unlike Opal, which is distance-based, Metrocard is time-based. Basically it's a flat-fee for around 2 hours and you only need to tap on, no tap-off required. So you can, for instance, travel from the CBD-Marion (a roughly 45-minute trip) and then connect to Glenelg all for one fare. You will need your concession card though if you are doing it and there's a list on the adelaide metro website. Trains are TINY over here and there are six set routes. Buses are generally every 15-30 minutes and unless they're CBD based, will typically stop going at around 11pm.   -If you get a chance, go out and visit Hahndorf, it is GORGEOUS. Ditto Port Adelaide.   -For shopping, Rundle Mall is obviously the closest and there is quite a variety in the CBD. If you want to go to the outer suburbs though, Westfield Marion is your best bet.   -If someone mentions a ""stobie pole"", they are referring to the wooden poles that carry electricity or cabling."

The ones here are good but I still miss Sydney."
Adelaide,3bvmyn,InertiaCreeping,-1,Mon Jul 6 01:59:34 2015 UTC,"Stay in Sydney. Here's why.   We follow AFL if you want to watch NRL games you can not watch them on free to air. We get 3 games a year can you guess which 3 they are? I don't care what anyone says the night life in Adelaide is a joke, everyone with a laptop thinks they can be a DJ and this is why our nightclubs and bars a just shit now. Any decent DJs only play at the big venues HQ on west terrace and Red Square in Hindley Street. Both of which are shit hole venues that are over priced and over crowded, staff are shit and as an ex bouncer that has worked in quite a number of places around Adelaide I will say this Security is shit. We have the police against us not helping us as there is a mentality that anyone who wants to be a bouncer must be a bikie. So either we go to far when dealing with a situation or not far enough, and get hounded by the media about what we do. Visiting Adelaide isn't too bad you have the various wine regions and other touristy things, but unless you have either work or study our state becomes very boring very fast. Nothing changes, think of us like your grandma's house it is just full of trinkets of days gone by and if you touch anything grandma tells you off. We have a lot of dangerous run down old buildings especially in the industrial areas not far from the city (again I used to provide security for these sorts of places) that need to be demolished for public safety however they are all heritage listed and there are massive legal costs and shit loads oh hoops for developers to do this. Don't listen to people when they say ""you'll get robbed/bashed/raped/murdered if you go to suburb XYZ"" it won't happen. The media here in Adelaide likes to sensationalise crime when it comes to shit happening in the Northern Suburbs, I have lived in Elizabeth my whole life I have been mugged once and that was at Marion which is South of the city. You will never hear about any crime in the eastern suburbs unless its a quick report on someone's expensive car being stolen but their crime rate is on par with every other zone its just different types of crimes. As long as you show pure hatred towards Victoria you'll fit in just fine"

Adelaide,3bvmyn,liver_stream,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:04:39 2015 UTC,"Thanks! Unfortunately I'm moving to Adelaide due to reasons out of my direct control (of which I won't go into at this point, it's about time I slept). I will be studying over there (Likely working, too).  Nightclubs/nightlife doesnt really matter to me that much, I've never been one for that kind of thing and it's pretty much the same situation (as far as shit clubs go) in Sydney according to my mates. Besides, with full-time study for two years and work inbetween, I doubt I'd have time to do anything besides working out and drinking coffee (lol!)  I have heard of people calling SA the ""Nanny State"" before, care to elaborate? AFAIK there doesn't seem to be any real problems with the SA government and their policies - then again, I've been born and raised in Sydney so what would I know about SA?  Your help is much appreciated.   P.S. This has got to be the longest comment I've ever writted for Reddit - something to do with how tired I am lol. I mat edit this down in the morning..."
Adelaide,3bvmyn,sa87,2,Thu Jul 2 17:14:29 2015 UTC,"Re the Nanny state stuff, it's more due to all of these supposed laws that are nonexistent (or not enforced) in Sydney. You'll hear it very much in the paper. Case in point: Burwood council (eastern suburbs) went after a tiny fish n chips shop because of their ""open sign"" violating some random policy. The WWCC system takes longer than Sydney (it took me about 1.5-2 weeks to get mine in Adelaide, in Sydney it took me 24 hours). Generally it's just anytime a law is introduced, people blather on about the nanny state.  This of course becomes HILARIOUS when people complain about not having a rego sticker on their car, because they ""can't remember when their rego is due."" (these people have typically never heard of a calendar, reminder system on their phone, keeping the rego certificate in their car etc.) Apparently SA is a nanny state, but the second they need to take responsibility for their own actions, they start screaming and crying that the government is ""revenue raising!"""

Adelaide,3bqcyj,MisuVir,3,Wed Jul 1 09:20:45 2015 UTC,"If you haven't already.. take some resume to the pubs and restaurants. Walk up to the bar or whatever and ask if you could speak to the manager or duty manager, hand them your resume and say could do waiting work, kitchen work, bottlo work.  Hospitality has a pretty high rotation - people come and go all the time, so chances are if you keep taking your resume in every few weeks they'll have an opening."
Adelaide,3bqcyj,6APe9,3,Wed Jul 1 10:31:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah just to append to this, get your RSA/RSG (Responsible Service of Alcohol & Gaming) and do the rounds at your locals + anywhere else you are willing to travel. At the least you might get a dish pig job. It is tough atm tho, I'm in the same boat. Good luck!"
Adelaide,3bqcyj,the_arkane_one,1 point,Wed Jul 1 09:34:16 2015 UTC,Try calling an Australian Apprenticeship Centre and seeing what retail things are on the go at the moment. They will point you in the right direction and take you through the steps. You can then also earn a formal qualification (on/off job training) that is fully subsidised and nationally recognised while you are at it.
Adelaide,3bqcyj,Cleops,1 point,Wed Jul 1 14:09:24 2015 UTC,"Even if you cannot find a job right now remember the Government will pay for you to do some courses. Here is the massive list of subsidised courses in South Australia to help people in your situation ala SIR30212 or the cert II.   Ooh, I also forgot to add the site Spotjobs as a lot of the retail ones tend to end up on there and not on the other usual sites. Thus a win-win for those in the know. EDIT: Remember to put whatever your postcode is/want to work in."
Adelaide,3bqcyj,Cleops,1 point,Thu Jul 2 04:13:32 2015 UTC,"Speak to job agencies. They can be good at setting you up with casual work. There are quite a few in the city, so make a list and then spend a day visiting them all.  If you can afford it, sign up for this course. They set you up with a place at the end of the course so you can get some work experience, and it covers all the basic stuff you need to get into the hospitality industry (RSA, general waiting skills, knowledge of how a bar/restaurant operates). If that's too expensive, just do the RSA course online. Check apps like Scoopon to see if any institutions are selling them cheap. The great thing about hospitality is, as others have said, the high turnover in staff (particularly waiters). Whilst experience is usually important, some places prefer less experienced staff that they can train from scratch. Once you have your RSA, apply at AILS (they do the soccer at Hindmarsh Stadium) and Adelaide Oval (I forgot what the agency is called, but they cover AFL, cricket and functions so there's the potential for a ton of work). The bartenders at sports venues are fucking awful and most of them have no idea how to pour a beer, so with even a little training you will be better than most.  If you check Gumtree, I've noticed a ton of ads for pizza delivery drivers recently. All you need is a car and a smartphone and you're a chance to land the job."

The format of once a week worked well as it left enough time for self study between lessons. If you choose to keep studying through levels 2 & 3 you should reach quite a good conversational level in Italian if you study hard.

Adelaide,3bogg5,darthpip,5,Wed Jul 8 07:46:41 2015 UTC,"I hear good thing about the Adelaide Uni courses. I studied Arabic as part of a UniSA degree and the tutors were pretty good but it varies. Having a good teacher is really important. Some pals from that course did the Adelaide ones too and liked them, but said some of the teachers weren't great.  You can also back it up with your own study, whether that's books or something like Rosetta Stone (Rosetta was useless for Arabic grammar but good for vocabulary - I hear it is better for European languages).  Keep in mind there are good resources for tutors via Skype etc, and probably some solo teachers on Gumtree. Caveat being it's hard to tell how good they are to begin with."

Adelaide,3bn24c,JohhnieDame1980,5,Tue Jun 30 15:20:43 2015 UTC,"Hey bro, $5k is a lot of money to travel on. I've gone more than a few months on that without living super frugally - eating and drinking pretty liberally but staying in hostels mostly etc.   The airfare will be your biggest chunk out of that to begin with. Some places like Europe or the US will be more expensive to get to but you'll have quite a few travel options once you're there.  Other places like Japan are pretty cheap to get to, sometimes offset by the cost once you arrive. Then living costs in country vary a lot, but everything is manageable on that budget.  Here's the passport site, it's a bit of a maze but you can download the forms you need, set up an appointment etc. It does take a bit of time to sort out but pretty easy over all.  Costs (and other stuff) to keep in mind:   Flights are the big one but vary a lot. You should be able to get to the US for $1200 if you're lucky, Europe varies a lot between $1300-1800 depending, Asia is cheaper typically. Accommodation. My recommendation is always hostels if possible, as they're cheap, usually have free WiFi, good resources and information for exploring new places, and it's very easy to meet people. You will also get good ideas from other travellers. They can range in price from $10 a night in cheaper countries to $50, usually about halfway there. Some countries it can vary within - like in Japan, a hostel in Tokyo will cost $40 or more, outside of Tokyo you can get ones for $20 or less. You will want a lock or something to keep your gear safe in a dorm. In any case, it's a huge saving from hotels and, if you feel like it, you can spoil yourself with a night or two at a hotel here and there. But you are usually saving $100 or so a night that way which means you can do a lot more while you travel. Food and drink. This varies between countries. Lots of places there is a wide range of options and you should be able to get good food quite cheaply wherever you are. You can also cook for yourself in hostels but I say get out there and try new stuff. Don't be afraid to get outside of your comfort zone. Drink also varies, South East Asian countries a beer will set you back $1, others will be more. Australia is at the more expensive end typically so most places will be cheaper than here for a night out. Transport. This varies depending on how you travel and where too. Within cities is usually cheap, sometimes free. Some places it will cost you up to $20-30 bucks a day if you're moving around a lot but that's rare. If you're doing travel between countries via bus or train that will be more. Some places like Japan and Europe have ticket setups where you can pay a flat rate for X amount of time (usually 2 weeks, a month, three months etc) and travel as much as you like on certain trains and buses.  Travel stuff. Depending how you are travelling and how long for you will want a good bag for it, but this won't cost heaps. Language. You can travel with just english pretty much anywhere on earth now. Places like the US and Europe are easier for this fact, others will like Asia will be harder but I think more enjoyable too. You can always do charades if no one can understand each other. Sometimes it helps learning a few basic phrases like toilet / hostel / menu recommendation etc.   I've done lots of cool trips on less than $5k. Sometimes it takes a while to get in the swing of things and get used to it, but you can travel very cheaply. I've done a two month, 10,000 mile roadtrip of the US on less than $5k (helps to split costs with friends if you are buying or renting a car). I've done two months in Japan living very comfortably on much less than $5k. You can do Hong Kong, Indonesia, South East Asia in general for very cheaply. I spent 1 month in the US + 4 months in Europe on less than $5k in the past (though that was a while ago now) and visited a whole bunch of countries. I had a trip to Germany to visit a friend early this year and it didn't cost much at all. I've lived and studied in the Middle East and travelled around for a couple of months on very little money. You have a lot of options, it really depends what you feel like is best.   I will say, when you don't have a lot of commitments, it's the best time to make the most of travel. If you have time, you should explore a lot and make the most of it. It's one of the best things you can do I reckon, and it does get harder when you have more commitments. Depending how confident you are, book a trip and the first week or two of accommodation... then leave it open and move about as you see fit, be flexible and have a good time.  If you want any advice or more specific info on a specific place, just give me a shout."

Adelaide,3bn24c,hexiledgame,1 point,Wed Jul 1 15:44:06 2015 UTC,"Just got back from two months in the US. It's not especially cheap due to the exchange rate so if you're on a budget, maybe try SE Asia first. Some places will be easier than others if you're nervous about language issues. China is getting easier, but would still be baffling if you didn't know any Mandarin, though you could find a tour of sorts - flights there are cheap at least. Malaysia, Thailand, etc would be easier.  In South America, Peru is fine without Spanish, but in Chile you will struggle. Most of Europe will be fine.  Travel while you have few dependencies. Share with a friend if you can, especially if you want to hire cars or avoid hostels.  Throw yourself in the deep end and challenge yourself!"

Then there's places like Hoi An (get a suit tailor made for under $100)  And you have Ha Long Bay...ah the list goes on. I didn't like Hanoi as much as I liked Ho Chi Minh City (The further North you go, the clearer it becomes you are in a communist country).

Adelaide,3blh1c,Denial23,4,Tue Jun 30 04:35:54 2015 UTC,"So basically........ Brick-and-mortar places have had a great run for years, but now that they have some competition for a month each year there's a big problem? If it wasn't for those pop-up venues I'd say that a fair chunk of the people in them would be home instead of out and about in town.  Businesses need to take advantage of the extra people in the city, not just sit there doing nothing and whinge that it's damaging their business. Give people a reason to come to them over Mad March."
Adelaide,3blh1c,dav3n,-1,Tue Jun 30 07:24:33 2015 UTC,"I think they have a legitimate concern. They pay rent and rates for the entire year through the highs and lows. The pop up events come along only in peak periods, make a killing and disappear until next year. Royal Croquet Club tours from city to city taking advantage of the best time for each.  Also worth pointing out there have been quite a few permanent venues who prioritise hosting Fringe events every year who have ended up going under. If they focused on a regular events through the year they might survive but forcing regular stuff to take a break for 2-3 months means it doesn't come back - they find other venues. This could mean more demand for smaller pop up venues during Fringe.  As for noise restrictions the permanent venues have to abide by them so why not pop ups too?"
Adelaide,3blh1c,aytakk,5,Tue Jun 30 07:46:30 2015 UTC,"What's the old saying........ ""Competition breeds innovation""? The only reason RCC exists is because some guys who couldn't afford a brick-and-mortar place went out on a limb, tried something different and started Little Miss Mexico. They succeeded because they did something new and exciting, and the people came, and this is what the brick-and-mortar places need to do. One of the guys behind it was also involved early on in the rise of the food truck.  Businesses close all the time, and there were plenty of city venues going out of business before the pop-ups came on the scene. Using them as the main reason they aren't making as much money as they'd like to is a bit of a cop out. As for noise restrictions, they have to abide to them too, businesses just want another set of rules for the pop-ups.  The only group that really has a right to complain is the West End Traders Association, the ACC really needs to help attract people down that side of town."
Adelaide,3blh1c,dav3n,0,Tue Jun 30 08:42:58 2015 UTC,See thats the thing about a food truck or a pop-up event. If business tails off they can simply relocate to where the action is. Permanent venues don't have that option.   The pop-ups don't really bring people in. They coincide with festivals that are already happening. Mad March will still be Mad March if they were around or not.   Also worth mentioning we have a lot of small bars that have got going and thrived. But even they see a big dip in trade in the busiest time of the year. This is a problem. If nothing is done the nightlife will die even more and Mad March will be all thats left. That isn't progressive.
Adelaide,3blh1c,aytakk,1 point,Tue Jun 30 20:19:21 2015 UTC,"Most businesses see a big dip in the December-January period when two thirds of people aren't at work.

Last year I went to almost no lectures at all, watched them all online, and found my overall engagement in my coursework was pretty pathetic. Following a string of disappointing grades, this year i decided to go to my lectures and engage in my coursework.   There were two things I found.   First, I actually have managed to make a few friends now which is nice. Last year was a bit shit because I didn't really know anyone.   Two, I feel that my overall learning experience has been enhanced by actually rocking up to my lectures.   I think Bebbington's whole front that he is doing this to move UofA into the technology era is absurd; more likely this is a front to cut essential staff and earn him more money."
Adelaide,3bht4a,ChunkyTomster,5,Mon Jun 29 22:48:14 2015 UTC,"This is exactly why UoA and UniSA and others moved to improving online delivery, because people wouldn't rock up and they were wasting staff time lecturing to less than half the class while others watched it online, so in some instances the staff now record lectures during downtime instead.  The problem is, if they try enforce attendance at lectures and too many start failing on that alone then it reflects poorly on the university.  In the end, uni is whatever you make it to be, if the lecturer is boring and opens for question time, make it interesting by asking some questions and actually interacting, don't be afraid of looking stupid and having some fun. The end of semester evaluations should be taken seriously too but again, students rarely take it seriously to provide proper feedback. So the university then evaluates based on the data they have as to how they provide services, lectures no one rocks up and online is booming? Invest more in IT infrastructure to support the trend."

Adelaide,3bhz5j,DocterXbox,3,Mon Jun 29 11:16:59 2015 UTC,"If I may piggyback on your thread, I've heard lots of horror stories re VORT, especially when done in a manual. Can anyone verify that you are restricted from changing down gears? Does this restriction really mean you must remain in the highest cruising gear (say 4th), brake to a stop for traffic lights in 4th, then clutch in just as the engine revs drop? That goes against everything I know, everything I've been taught, & everything I've experienced in the last 30 years.  You're coming to a stop in 4th - unless you've got a powerful vehicle with lots of low down torque (and a high power output to get you moving quickly in the higher gear) you have no option to accelerate from any hazard. Rev-matched downshifts is what should be expected, to keep the engine in the power band and also providing the best compression to slow you down.  I also believe you can supply your own vehicle for VORT, is this true? If so, this places some learners at a HUGE advantage over others what with blind spot assist and smaller turning circles for parking manoeuvres etc."
Adelaide,3bhz5j,adlcbt,1 point,Mon Jun 29 13:30:26 2015 UTC,"I would love to be the first person to bring a Google self-driving car to a driving test!  Ps.

I'd rather not take the risk."
Adelaide,3bhz5j,greenmartian26,1 point,Mon Jun 29 15:09:08 2015 UTC,"Not 100% sure, but I expect the restriction applies to using the gears to slow down.    My opinion (may not correspond with the official VORT rules): Change gears down while slowing so that you're in the correct gear, but keep the clutch engaged."
Adelaide,3bhz5j,hellboy1975,1 point,Tue Jun 30 07:25:46 2015 UTC,"Aus road rules regulation 297 part 1 - ""A driver must not drive a vehicle unless the driver has proper control of the vehicle.""  I would argue that freewheeling any longer than is absolutely necessary to allow for a smooth gear change is not being in proper control. Every gear you are in should be engaged to the engine at all times, unless between gears or you are almost stopped.  (EDIT: why even have the restriction in place anyway? Its perfectly legal to do)"
Adelaide,3bhz5j,adlcbt,1 point,Tue Jun 30 08:11:23 2015 UTC,"I tend to do both personally, depending on the situation.  I feel like I'm in control regardless of whether the gear is engaged or not.    I agree, it is a silly restriction, and I'm not sure how they define ""proper control"" in this situation."
Adelaide,3bhz5j,hellboy1975,3,Tue Jun 30 11:42:39 2015 UTC,"Myself and a bunch of mates got tested a few years back (by multiple testers) and we all felt that the testers were fair and professional. Even those that did fail admit they can't fault the testers.   One got hit by a random audit, and had to re-sit his test with an auditor in the back seat.. Bad luck on his part, though he still passed. Apparently audits were pretty common back then, so it was pretty hard to find a lenient tester.  You're describing the opposite case, though, where they deliberately fail students. I guess that's harder to catch with an audit..  Bear in mind this was like 5-7 years ago, and around the western suburbs.  As far as tips go, aim for 2-3ks below speed limit to make sure you NEVER go past. Just don't let the needle touch the limit ever. Keep in mind they'll be looking at your speedo from the left, so they'll have a somewhat skewed view.  Don't take risks. If you think you can just make it through a gap in traffic, consider not taking it. If the incoming car has to slow down, you will lose points (yes in real life, there are times where there's just no such thing as a safe gap, and you just have to take whatever gap you can take, but this is a test). My tester actually told me to do exactly that, after waiting about 5 minutes. ""Thanks for telling me why you wouldn't take those gaps earlier, and you were right to do so, but let's just take this one so we're not stuck here for another half hour"".  Oh and always move your head when doing mirror checks. Never simply glance at you rearview. They are human. You can't expect them to watch for eye movements while also watching for traffic and hazards. A head movement is so much more obvious.  And lastly, make sure you empty your bladder beforehand :)"
Adelaide,3bhz5j,greenmartian26,1 point,Mon Jun 29 14:37:41 2015 UTC,"My friend suggested that you should announce it every time you check a mirror. Dunno if that's disallowed or whatever, but it makes sense to me."
Adelaide,3bhz5j,penmonicus,2,Tue Jun 30 03:43:09 2015 UTC,"I think it really depends on the tester to be honest.   In my VORT (about 4-5 years ago now) the tester told me he was sick so I would auto pass the reverse parallel as he didn't want to get out of the car.   To contrast, I had a mate that did the VORT (around the same time) in a different area and got instantly failed for going 50 in a ""25 when children present zone.""  It was a mum with a baby wrapped up inside her coat facing the opposite direction...   I think either way it's a good idea to do at least 2 or 3 lessons with an instructor to get a general idea of the expectations of a VORT, for example they can be very strict about minor things like the order you check your mirrors in, precise amount of time at stop signs, etc."

He even flat out refused to sign off on anything in first lesson we tried something, even if I executed it perfectly 3 times in a row.  The worst was when he refused to sign off on my stop sign bit, because I took to long to go. I took so long because it was peak hour and there was no opportunity.  I ended up going to a different instructor, who signed off nearly half my book after the initial session. He was pretty surprised how empty my book was."

Tea Tree Gully, saved my good friends dog who was involved in a massive car accident but made her walk like new again so they are definitely a good option aswell. Paradise was where we had my oldest dog put down a few years ago which was unfortunate, but they were very lovely and a lot of help.   so in my eyes these are the best vets around the place. Best of luck :)"
Adelaide,3bhgve,Jon2567,5,Mon Jun 29 07:16:26 2015 UTC,+1 for Tea Tree Gully Vet.  Been to a few around the North East and they're the best by a mile.

Adelaide,3bhgve,lseb,1 point,Mon Jun 29 06:53:36 2015 UTC,"Oh hey, you're near me. I take my dogs to the Vets 4 Pets on Fosters Road, and they've always been wonderful, even happy to give me quick answers over the phone instead of coming in for an appointment. They're not 24/7, but they're linked to the V4P up at Golden Grove which is all hours emergency, and your records are shared between both, which is nice.  Conversely, I'd recommend against the Pet Universe up at Northgate shopping center. My staffy has a rash that comes and goes every year or so, and every other vet has prescribed it steroid cream. They pushed hard for diagnostic tests, bloodwork, and cleaning it under anesthesia (?!), all of which was going to run several hundred bucks. Took him back to Fosters' Vets 4 Pets, they gave him steroid cream, it cleared up within days as usual. From other reviews it looks like they do that a lot, it looks sus as hell."

Adelaide,3bhgve,kittenishgirl,1 point,Mon Jun 29 14:59:55 2015 UTC,"Sounds like a contact allergy (is it around the abdomen, armpits etc.?)  Steroid creams will alleviate the symptoms, but do nothing to fix the underlying cause. Unfortunately it's better to spend a bit more sometimes to get the answers."

I took my male Burmese kitten to the Unley Rd one to get desexed, great service, friendly staff. They only charge if they 'do' stuff, so just a check up is generally free. Does make some of the other services a bit more expensive but worth it if you're a helicopter parent!  Edit: regularly took my female English Bull Terrier to the South Rd clinic. Staff were just as brilliant!"

It's cool that if one is booked up on the day, they will check to see if you can go to one of the other branches. When you have an emergency this is nice. I don't think they do free check ups anymore though, had a sign up the other week when I took my cat in to the South Rd one."

Adelaide,3benxz,SparkyRailgun,7,Mon Jun 29 01:33:16 2015 UTC,"Can't really see a downside to this, although it would be logical to have a permit to exempt people from this if they can be proven to breed animals in a suitable manner."
Adelaide,3benxz,lymantriidae_,4,Mon Jun 29 05:02:50 2015 UTC,"Yes to both, and microchipping. Far too many animals are destroyed, abandoned, become feral and so on"
Adelaide,3benxz,IC_Pandemonium,2,Mon Jun 29 03:12:14 2015 UTC,"It's really not that expensive to do (kittens from the shelter, desexed and vacc'd are under 200$) and I'm not sure I really see an upside to having a fertile pet. I don't think there is any normative statement being made about how people take care of pets.  I feel the cat/dog split is the work of some 19 year old intern that took a look at ownership statistics and saw the opportunity to push this through initially on the cat owner majority and subsequently widen it to both."
Adelaide,3benxz,LivinginAdelaide,1 point,Mon Jun 29 06:38:18 2015 UTC,"I'm up for that, as long as people can apply for a breeding license, and have it revoked if they abuse it or are shown to be negligent. I really want stronger rules for pet care minimums."
Adelaide,3benxz,Dimbit,1 point,Tue Jun 30 01:44:08 2015 UTC,I've been wanting to see something like this happen for ages.  There are so many terrible pretty owners who face no consequences of their terribleness.
Adelaide,3benxz,Aardvark_Man,1 point,Tue Jun 30 08:51:36 2015 UTC,I'm torn on this.    I don't like that they don't think I'm not responsible enough to take care of my pets. But I also know someone who has cats that aren't desexed and aren't vaccinated (and somehow doesn't see an issue with this).
Adelaide,3benxz,Azora,1 point,Mon Jun 29 01:58:29 2015 UTC,Cat's should be the priority compared to dogs. People let their cats roam the streets all day and night. Dogs are kept in the property pretty much all of the time.
Adelaide,3benxz,nightjesus,1 point,Mon Jun 29 13:01:04 2015 UTC,No! My beautiful Golden Retriever (turns 5 in 2 months) isn't desexed and is the best behaved dog of all time. And it may sound a bit biased but he is the cutest fucking dog in the world.   I think my parents are going to breed him but I have no idea.
Adelaide,3benxz,aytakk,-2,Tue Jun 30 14:22:43 2015 UTC,This feels like its getting a lot of pressure from registered breeders to help them corner the market. Which will in turn drive up prices.  Should pets only be available to people who can afford to shell out $500+ to acquire them? Isn't that a tad classist?
Adelaide,3beo3d,Badooleoo,4,Sun Jun 28 15:06:56 2015 UTC,"I love the photo of the politicians doing a ""symbolic start""... with shovels. Now move aside and let some people do the real work."

Adelaide,3beo3d,jerry_hellloooooo,3,Mon Jun 29 02:22:33 2015 UTC,"Pretty ironic that he's dressed as a construction worker, considering he is one of the biggest opponents of the working class in the Government. He was one of the key visionaries behind Work Choices and would strip the pay and conditions from every blue collar worker in Australia if he had the chance. The world would be a better place if Jamie Briggs had become a council worker instead of a politician.   Also, this project was inevitable. The Mount Barker expansion has been a disaster, with rapid expansion onto prime agricultural land that has vastly outpaced the infrastructure of the area. All while Liberals have held the area at state and federal level.   Unfortunately, he's in an extremely safe seat so this twit can get away with doing diddly-squat for his electorate."

Adelaide,3beo3d,dexter311,0,Mon Jun 29 09:07:04 2015 UTC,Bout time. Will be great when it's done. 15mins to get on the freeway instead of driving all the way to Verdun.
Adelaide,3beo3d,Koadster,-2,Mon Jun 29 01:11:00 2015 UTC,The long-term plan is to have a road corridor through Adelaide with as few stops as possible.   Except for the region around the bottom of the freeway.

Adelaide,3beo3d,MisuVir,1 point,Mon Jun 29 00:20:10 2015 UTC,I would imagine the long term plan is to connect the SE freeway with the future south road freeway. Then trucks could go from Murray Bridge all the way to Port Adelaide and out again to Gawler/Port Wakefield without a traffic light.

Adelaide,3bdtox,romeowmontague,8,Sun Jun 28 07:28:29 2015 UTC,Caves down in the South East (Naracoorte & Mt Gambier) are well worth seeing.    Wilpena Pound is a great spot for a weekend as well.
Adelaide,3bdtox,hellboy1975,3,Sun Jun 28 07:46:20 2015 UTC,We have decided that is what we will do (Naracoorte/Mt G). Thank you!
Adelaide,3bdtox,hellboy1975,3,Mon Jun 29 10:57:02 2015 UTC,"Things I'd see in the area:   Naracoorte Caves (obviously) - depending on your budget, you can see them all.  If you have to choose I'd go with the Victoria Fossil Cave tour.  It gives you the best bang for your buck with some nice decoration, as well as some interesting displays regarding the Australia's fossil records. Plenty of good wineries around Penola! Umperstone Sinkhole just outside of Mt Gambier is a cool (and free) cave to visit. Tantanoola Cave is quite nice as well, probably the prettiest in the area, but is also quite small. Walk to the top of Mt Schank, which is south of Mt Gambier. Ewens Ponds (also south of Mt Gambier) is fantastic for snorkelling.  Will be bloody cold at this time of year though!  If the cold is no barrier, give it a go.  Bring a wetsuit and snorkelling gear, or hire it at the dive shop in Allendale. Macs Hotel in Mt Gambier do a good feed."

Adelaide,3bco9m,midnightsubzero,11,Sat Jun 27 23:31:18 2015 UTC,I lived at the Village for a year. I really didn't enjoy my time there. There's were a few exchange students from around the world but 80%+ of the people were really quiet asian international students. Visting Urbanest gave me the impression that there was a much larger mix of exchange students and they were a lot more social. You might want to think about going to one of the residential colleges as well. There's not as many international students there but it's a much tighter knit community and easier to make friends.
Adelaide,3bco9m,Adelaide_Strikers,1 point,Sun Jun 28 03:00:53 2015 UTC,Okay thank you! May i ask why you didn't enjoy your time? Unfortunately the only residential college available is St Marks but that's way to expensive
Adelaide,3bco9m,Adelaide_Strikers,3,Sun Jun 28 23:06:43 2015 UTC,"I didn't like it largely because I found it difficult to meet new people there. Becoming friends with the asian international students was hard because they were so quiet and they generally like to hang out with people from their home country. There also weren't very many organised social events. Only a BBQ once a semester and a movie night each week.   St Marks is about $6000/year more than the Village or Urbanest but it also includes all of your meals in the price. When you take that into account, the price isn't that much more expensive."
Adelaide,3bco9m,Mcurt,1 point,Mon Jun 29 00:47:00 2015 UTC,"Ah i see,  its a similar story here at my university. It does seem to lack a bit on the social side of things tbf Yeah i took a look at their website and stuff but it doesn't really seem that appealing"
Adelaide,3bco9m,AnalBenevolence,4,Mon Jun 29 17:31:32 2015 UTC,"Oi!!  I'm at urbanest right now... just did a semester exchange and I'm moving out in two weeks. There's some good and bad things about living here. I've met some of the coolest people ever here and there's definitely a wide range of international origins at urbanest. It really helps you get a solid friend circle right off the bat, which is super nice. As the guy that stayed at the village said, there are still a lot of unsocial asian students, so it's kind of random when it comes to who is in your apartment. I luckily got some really cool roommates from Canada, Germany, and France (I'm from the U.S.). So the social aspect is really good if you take advantage of it. All the people on my floor are awesome. The rooms are a bit small but I didn't mind the rooms at all. The kitchen is pretty good for hanging out, and better if you get one with a TV (or make friends with one haha). Urbanest has a lot of free food events, which is pretty cool. It's walking distance from the North Terrace campus and right next to the tram and train station, also really nice.   Now for the bad stuff. The internet sucks ass. I don't know if they're working on fixing it, but let's just say I'm not sure how they can call themselves student accommodation with such shit internet. It's usually alright during the day, but at night when it's busy it's sometimes unusable, especially if you're not in the right spot of the apt. Like I can't play music from spotify in the kitchen. They also have a strict room inspection DURING the mid semester break, which is completely idiotic. Smoking isn't allowed, but it's pretty easy to just blow it out the window. Plus, most people agree that it's just too expensive. I had a lot of friends living in houses or homestay or whatever it's called, and they liked that plus it's cheaper. If I was staying more than a semester there's no way I'd be at Urbanest.  Overall, for one semester, it was awesome to be living so conveniently close to my friends. Kinda like living in fancy dorms with some benefits and some disadvantages. Anyway, hope that helps and good luck. Cheers"
Adelaide,3bco9m,AnalBenevolence,3,Sun Jun 28 05:30:37 2015 UTC,"Another urbanester here. Internet is, like the accommodation, too expensive. With an ethernet cable though, it's generally reliable. The Wifi is abysmal.  The room inspections aren't strict, and you don't have to be there. However, they might be annoying if you're not the clean type.  The apartments are great, flatmates are lucky dip, but it is simply too expensive. Don't come for two semesters. The people I know who did best with their accommodation found houses. They pay waaay less, have more space, places for parties etc.  TDLR: Urbanest is convenient, well designed and fitted. However, it is waaay too expensive, the internet can be infuriating, and you can get better if you don't mind a ten minute train ride to uni"
Adelaide,3bco9m,AnalBenevolence,2,Sun Jun 28 11:34:14 2015 UTC,Thank you :) So because ill be at Adelaide for 1 year what would you recommend? One semester there and one somewhere else? Thing with the private accommodation you have to find people to live with right?
Adelaide,3bco9m,Mcurt,2,Sun Jun 28 23:18:27 2015 UTC,"I know several groups who found each other in temporary accommodation, and managed to find a house for a year. If you are fairly outgoing, you should have no problem meeting a group to shack up with. If you choose to do this, the hospital offers (apparently rubbish) temporary accommodation, where lots of international students gather for the first few weeks while looking for houses. If you book in there, meet lots of people, go to the events etc. you should be able to make/join a gang finding a house."
Adelaide,3bco9m,Mcurt,1 point,Mon Jun 29 04:34:34 2015 UTC,Ah okay then. Yeah this is something i am really considering at the moment because i have realised how much cheaper it is. Apparently the uni helps with booking accommodation if you do it that way? (or so i heard)
Adelaide,3bco9m,panchlet,2,Mon Jun 29 17:35:58 2015 UTC,"The uni provides some kind of help I think. Have you not forms etc. yet? They will give contact details, accommodation options etc. That's all I know - as I say, I stayed at urbanest"

Yeah sounds like its more mixed than the village is which is always a good thing. Plus im always a sucker for free food Ok so if you was staying for longer than a semester where would you go?
Adelaide,3bco9m,InertiaCreeping,2,Sun Jun 28 23:15:24 2015 UTC,I'd say if you can find a house of younger people that are looking for a roommate that would be good. But if you can't find one I think Urbanest would be just fine

Adelaide,3b8y4f,basefield,2,Sat Jun 27 05:10:25 2015 UTC,"This bloke is on a committee to look into the wind turbine industry, but it seems he's been hijacked by lobbyists or gone fucking crazy.   It's a senate select committee set up by Bob and other senators most of which are against (or have issues with) wind power in the first place, not some kind of independent group that's been hijacked.  These kind of things get set up all the time and give their findings, then in cases like this the government has to try to placate them in the hope of securing their senate votes.  In this case the government has had to secure their votes (when it comes to the crossbenchers) on the renewable energy target by pledging to establish a commissioner to look at complaints about wind farms and what is supposed to be an ""independent scientific committee"" researching the issue and giving findings rather than some senate committee, so we'll see where that goes.   SA is the laughing stock of the nation being accused of a real NIMBY, backwards and out of date, out of touch mentality.   Well South Australia is by far the biggest producer and user of wind power so in practice it's not exactly our backyards that are a no-go zone."

The interstate link is standard gauge.   so even if they were fitted with standard gauge bogies and towed here by train, they would then have to be changed again somewhere.

But maybe the available clearances on a standard gauge line are too tight to ship something designed with broad gauge clearances in mind."

The parklands around the city are always nice, the botanic gardens for a picnic, maybe play some outdoor games or just relax. There's rooftop golf in the city. With a dash of imagination and a positive outlook (which remember a lot of Adelaidians complain that adelaide is boring but it really isn't) you will finds heaps of family favourites! Good luck friend and welcome home :D"

The state government only ever tinkers around at the edges (which, I might add, wastes a lot of money in the process). You aren't going to generate change by sticking some new technology park in the outer suburbs or spending zillions on a new hospital that has fewer beds than the old one.   Better transport infrastructure, lower payroll tax, eliminate zoning laws which require businesses to go through hoops to paint their offices, state-run private health insurer?

Adelaide,3b28o1,Obelisk_Inc,5,Thu Jun 25 22:23:10 2015 UTC,Residential apartments in the CBD are killing pubs and the nightlife. They build them near Rundle St because people like easy access to the culture then they complain because it gets noisy on weekends.

Adelaide,3b28o1,aytakk,4,Thu Jun 25 14:10:51 2015 UTC,"Totally agree with you. The effects that residential complaining has had on our nightlife is ridiculous.

Adelaide,3b28o1,_yourclothesarered,2,Fri Jun 26 01:38:53 2015 UTC,Residential apartments in the CBD are killing pubs and the nightlife.   wait can you explain this further? I would have thought that more CBD housing would actually incentivise people to go out more because its just a short walk (and you can get drunk and just walk home). That all sounds pretty good to me.
Adelaide,3b28o1,Helelix,5,Fri Jun 26 03:48:10 2015 UTC,I used to work at the Crown and Anchor Hotel. There were constant complaints about the noise from apartments built nearby. It got to the point where the pub was forced into adhering to some very draconian liquor license and noise restrictions. Its not fair as the pub was there first.  Its not the only venue being effected like this either. A lot of venues can't have live music from 12am onwards due to noise restrictions. If they have DJs they need to turn it right down.  The 3am lockout is having an effect too but its also noise restrictions. The changes in smoking laws a few years ago didn't help much either as you can't provide loud music in a beer garden/open balcony.
Adelaide,3b28o1,aytakk,5,Fri Jun 26 01:49:23 2015 UTC,Amazing how people can move to an already established environment and then demand a certian way of life. It's like moving to a 20 acre yard in the country and demanding the grass doesn't grow because you hate mowing!!
Adelaide,3b28o1,yukimibubble,5,Fri Jun 26 02:02:14 2015 UTC,"Used to work at the Stag years ago.  We had to drag the recycle bins into the kitchen every night at 11pm, because otherwise one of the people in the apartments nearby would complain about the sound of bottles being chucked in in bins. So we'd have to blanket every surface with tea towels to make sure any fragments of glass couldn't end up in someone's meal the next day. (I still don't know how they got that past health inspectors - the bins were filthy).  There's a reason why the Austral doesn't have a beer garden any more. They had to enclose it ""for noise pollution"" reasons, because fuckwits nearby didn't like the noise from live music.   The Gov experienced similar issues, but fortunately the council pointed out that the Gov was there first and people should have expected noise when they moved in next door.  CBD housing is fine if it's populated by people who understand there are downsides to living in the CBD. Unfortunately, there always seem to be just enough people living nearby who think everything should shut down as soon as they go to bed."
Adelaide,3b28o1,Occulto,1 point,Fri Jun 26 09:46:29 2015 UTC,geez. why would people move into the CBD and not expect more noise? They probably used to live in suburbia where it was rare to even see a car on the road after 10pm. I wonder what they were expecting...

Adelaide,3axfjf,blerko,1 point,Wed Jun 24 18:21:25 2015 UTC,"Nope. Advertiser Newspapers Limited (ANPL) were listed on the stock exchange until 1988 (or thereabouts) and The Advertiser was the direct competitor to the News Corp ""The News"" tabloid published afternoons in SA. Besides The Advertiser, ANPL also had 5AD, 5SE (and I think 5PI), Griffin Press and National Paper Vuepak. It was as independent as you could get back then, as were most broadsheets.  From what I remember: Murdoch purchased a controlling interest in Herald and Weekly Times which in turn had a controlling share in ANPL. He then offered something like an incredible $9/share for stock that was previously trading around $2.25/share to ensure he had full control of The Advertiser. Media ownership laws of the time meant he had to sell off 5AD and the other radio interests. Can't remember if he sold or lost interest in the other divisions, but anyway he had the prize he had set his sights on.   He then sold ""The News"" to his mate Roger Holden who ""tried"" to make a go of publishing an afternoon paper, but couldn't compete and closed The News without offering it for sale some time soon after.   Eventually The Advertiser became tabloid and cuts to the bottom line meant that the quality suffered. Appointments such as Piers Ackerman as editor made sure Rupert's views were reflected.  Adelaide remained the home of News Corp and until HQ was moved to Delaware (around 10 years ago?), and so the AGM was held annually in Adelaide.  Source: Worked there for a long time around the takeover and had to make shared computer systems between publications appear to be independent of each other."

Weren't ""local businesses"" just recently complaining about the reduced amount of on-street parking, and now they've voted to remove even more? What's going on?  Seems like a strange decision. Not sure why they've decided to ignore the independent report.   Instead of wasting money redesigning brand-new infrastructure, why don't they spend it extending the bikeway all the way to North Tce so it actually joins up with the rest of our bicycle infrastructure and creates a safer north-south corridor for cycling through the city?"

Adelaide,3ax98r,ntebis,-2,Wed Jun 24 07:52:57 2015 UTC,Maybe they should be made to pay a nominal fee and then there would be a mandate for all roads to be safe for cyclists.
Adelaide,3ax98r,YourPassportNumber,1 point,Wed Jun 24 08:25:29 2015 UTC,There are a million reasons why cyclist registration is a bad idea. Here's just a few.

Adelaide,3ax98r,hugepedlar,-1,Wed Jun 24 06:59:20 2015 UTC,"I don't mean registration for the purpose of rider identification, but rather to have cyclists represented when roads are designed."
Adelaide,3ax98r,YourPassportNumber,1 point,Wed Jun 24 08:24:23 2015 UTC,I already pay taxes.
Adelaide,3ax98r,hugepedlar,0,Wed Jun 24 07:02:04 2015 UTC,I'm afraid I don't understand what you're getting at. Without rider identification how can their payment be enforced? And why would making cyclists pay a fee be necessary to make roads safe for them? Do pedestrians pay to use pedestrian crossings?
Adelaide,3ax98r,YourPassportNumber,-1,Fri Jun 26 01:00:28 2015 UTC,"With just a generic registration sticker. And pedestrians don't walk along the road, they just cross it out of necessity."
Adelaide,3ax98r,hugepedlar,1 point,Wed Jun 24 07:10:07 2015 UTC,"Yeah you still haven't explained the link between cyclists paying a fee and making the roads safer. Plus the administrative burden of managing a registration system, however simple you think it might be, would push the cost of registration out of the reach of poor people - the kind of people who can't afford a car - not to mention children. The fact is that no other country in the world mandates cyclist registration and there is no support for it at any level of government. Because it just won't work."
Adelaide,3ax98r,Ehnto,-4,Wed Jun 24 07:26:04 2015 UTC,"Maybe it would be easier to give bikes little number plates, then cameras could automatically read the plates and find out if the bike is registered or not."
Adelaide,3ax98r,YourPassportNumber,0,Wed Jun 24 07:39:58 2015 UTC,"Rather than call that the most idiotic idea I've ever read, I'll quote from one of the articles I linked earlier that you didn't read:   Mounting a visible plate would be a challenge. Modern bicycles come in myriad shapes and sizes. Most bikes don't have rear racks, or even the mounting points to fit one. A large, transverse-mounted plate would stick out, possibly injuring the rider and pedestrians, and damaging cars. And think of the costs involved in designing, manufacturing and distributing this range of contraptions."
Adelaide,3ax98r,Ehnto,3,Wed Jun 24 07:44:17 2015 UTC,"Motorbikes manage. Also it needn't be a large metal plate, it could be a sticker that gets checked by traffic officers. The simple fact is if it were to become law, you would have to find a way. Difficulty doesn't negate something from being considered and the end cost would fall on the user and manufacturers so I'm sure the government wouldn't be wildly concerned.  To be clear I think bike registration is a bad idea for a huge number of reasons , but I think the plate concern is a bit flimsy.  If we shouldn't have a regulation it should be because the regulation is flawed not because the implementation is hard."
Adelaide,3ax98r,hugepedlar,-1,Wed Jun 24 07:51:14 2015 UTC,"It'd just be a simple bracket. It's not that hard, even for the typical cyclist."
Adelaide,3ax98r,Ehnto,-7,Wed Jun 24 08:25:58 2015 UTC,"Car registration pays to maintain infrastructure designed for motor vehicles, bike registration pays to maintain infrastructure designed for bikes, including adjustments to motorways such as additions of cycle lanes.  Whether you think it will work or not, it is a pretty simple concept.  edit: it was brought to my attention that this was incorrect."

Adelaide,3ax98r,wordplayar,0,Wed Jun 24 08:35:22 2015 UTC,There are probably a very minimal number of cyclists who don't have a car liscence and also a car they pay registration for.

Adelaide,3ax98r,Kamikaze_VikingMWO,0,Wed Jun 24 09:06:39 2015 UTC,"As a cyclist and driver I found the Frome Rd bikeway dangerous! Better cycling infrastructure is great but the way they're doing it doesn't make sense to me. Cyclists need either separate pathways entirely traffic separated (which I can't see being practical in Adelaide without closure of roads) or safe bikeways and driver/cyclist education. Sharing roads is easy if cyclists are responsible (a big problem) and drivers are responsible (another big problem). Let's start by making car safety checks compulsory for any car over three years of age (emissions, brakes, illegal modifications, etc) like everywhere else. Police enforcement of road rules - you know, old style policing?   When it's not safe as a cyclist you ride your bike in the middle of the lane (away from doors). During most busy hours your moving as fast as motor vehicles anyway and doesn't cause an obstruction.   Separately I'm confused with the removal of left turn lanes in favour of a bike lane (which just mysteriously ends - or is molested by angry bus drivers). No left turn lanes slows traffic greatly and doesn't aid safety of cyclists. If Adelaide is going to fix it's car culture it needs to have a long-term vision and confidence to commit to it. However with an inability to confirm basic details such as traffic suitability/traction of pavers might point to a larger problem..."
Adelaide,3ax98r,Kennen_Rudd,5,Wed Jun 24 08:03:07 2015 UTC,"I agree with some of your points but I don't think those are all solutions. Car safety checks are a good idea, but my safety fear while cycling isn't about car emissions or brakes or whatever - it's about getting doored or swiped by cars, neither of which depend on those checks.  Separated bike lanes are the best in this case and they're targeted at a more casual cyclist like me. That's specifically who the Frome bikeway was targeted to - and it worked, 23% more cyclists. And if it was better connected I imagine that number would only rise.   I want to ride more but 'cause I'm not doing it every day, I can't keep pace with traffic to ride in the middle of the lane. Add to that that it can be quite a long commute the chances of getting hit go up and up.   There were obviously mistakes made in the design - the left turns are pointed out in the report as being a safety hazard since the rules were unclear etc etc.   But better than tearing the thing down, just improve it or extend it out with those improvements in mind. As it is, this is a big waste of money that is essentially ending the chance of getting better cycling infrastructure in the city. And that's the reason the councillors are doing it."
Adelaide,3ax98r,Kamikaze_VikingMWO,1 point,Wed Jun 24 23:33:10 2015 UTC,"You're correct that emissions, brakes etc isn't the issue re cycling safety. I mentioned it to point out the safety-adverse, minimal enforcement that's culturally present in SA. If cars and cyclists actually were fines for not signalling, failing to yield, illegally u-turning we'd have safer roads for all users.  I'm certain as a cyclist you'd easily keep pace at 5:15pm with everyone stationary heading north towards North Tce :-)  It would be great if something could be salvaged or learnt from the Frome Rd trial..."
Adelaide,3ax98r,Kennen_Rudd,2,Thu Jun 25 01:46:11 2015 UTC,"Ah okay, I get you. You may well be right, that enforcement is lacking, but the police can't be everywhere at all times in any case. You're probably right on the 5.15 part. The sheer number of cars would make me a little nervous though and it's not rare for people to get impatient during traffic. Just makes me nervous on the road is all.  Anyway. yeah. It'd be nice if something could be learnt. They're keeping a bike lane if they go ahead ripping it up, but it'll be smaller and basically status quo on the road."
Adelaide,3ax98r,try_____another,1 point,Thu Jun 25 01:59:20 2015 UTC,"As a cyclist and driver    First balanced opinion I've read.  I never understood why they had to make it so big in the first place. What's wrong with normal bike lanes?   As a cyclist It looks to have way more room than the amount of cycle traffic on that section would need, As a driver (motorbike) when I first encountered it barely had time to realise that my lane was ending and merge into the other lane. As someone who used to work in traffic operations i dont understand why they'd want to congest car traffic even further in the CBD."
Adelaide,3ax98r,Kennen_Rudd,3,Thu Jun 25 02:23:11 2015 UTC,"There's a lot of context here.   The road is not wide enough for a cycle path + two lanes of traffic unless the cycle path is the same old thin stretch of paint. The councillors are conveniently not discussing this even though they're well aware of it, but just removing the wide concrete bits will not make the road wide enough for 2 lanes of traffic both ways. I assure you that as a cyclist (and yes, I drive a car too, most of us do) it is not unreasonably wide. Literally any change to the way a street works causes confusion. The biggest problem here is that there's so much pushback on any sort of reasonably cycling infrastructure in Adelaide the council only ever dares to do a few streets at a time. Naturally we get endless complaints about how the infrastructure is dangerous because ""it just ends"" and ""drivers don't understand it"" well of course those things are true, most of the city is still a car's paradise and the infrastructure is barely a year old. Adelaide has roads that are designed to carry high traffic volume and will continue to do so. There's volumes of evidence that car traffic expands to fill additional capacity, in the long term the only real solution is to incentivise alternative modes of transportation - walking, cycling, public transport. The report the Council itself commissioned shows that congestion was not increased along Frome Road. It simply counter-factual to suggest that opening the street up to 4 lanes will do anything positive for the experience of drivers.   Look, I'm Danish born (and on that note, Anne Moran is a terrible person for misrepresenting our cycling infrastructure just to further her own agenda) and I've been telling the cycling community for years that it'd be easier, faster and cheaper to introduce cycling with the simple raised pathways that dominate the Danish infrastructure rather than what is in truth a more Dutch-style fully separated bikeway. I'm not wedded to the idea of massive bits of concrete but the thing is already built and functioning as well as could be expected in this city. Ignoring a $90K report to spend more money tearing it down just because a bunch of residents and councillors live in fantasy land is lunacy."

I don't use it for anything else while in the car unless I am parked somewhere. It would suck to be fined for that.   It would also suck to be hit by a distracted driver fiddling with their phone instead of watching the road so losing the phone entirely would be a small price to pay I guess. I wonder if phones shouldn't have a ""driving mode"" where display and input are disabled. So you could set them up to navigate or play music and then change the mode before driving.

Regularly washing towels & pillow cases is another good one."

If you can forgive the hipsterness (hipsterness?) of the east end, there is a real night out to be had there. Pop up bars, craft breweries and wine tastings are often held here. You have the entire festival season. You have the ELEPHANT (sorry a local favourite of myself and my compatriots)! You have awesome eateries to try.   If the east end is not for you then you can try gouger street and china town for a meal with friends and some drinks.   Inevitably you may end up on hindley street and I agree with the author of the article that most of the dives here are basically shit and worth avoiding at all costs. But if these places are for you, and you aren't one of the vile cunts who frequents this street (which obviously 99% of us are not) then a good night can theoretically be had!

Adelaide,3atqjx,Elixarous,7,Tue Jun 23 13:02:59 2015 UTC,"I did the uni thing straight out of school, and then the TAFE thing a couple years later, and so did my SO. Also in creative fields.  The atmosphere is significantly different, IMHO due to these factors:  1) In uni you will have breaks between classes. This leads to big pockets of time (typically 1-4 hours) where you're not really doing anything, but it's inconvenient to leave campus. This is no accident! You'll inevitably peel off with a group and go to uni bar, go to the library, or lay in the grass discussing Nietzsche or some shit. In TAFE this doesn't happen, at least not in my experience. Your classes will either run all day, with a short break for lunch, or they'll be back-to-back. No extended breaks where you're forced to make friends. You'll still make friends, sure, but those friendships won't be forged in beery extended post-class discourse.   2) The supporting facilities are different. Of course there's the uni bar and coffee shops etc (the uni I went to had a place that did red bull slushies, pretty sure no TAFE has one of them). But, I also mean things like student services (counselling etc), peer-assisted study sessions, mentoring programs, essay-writing help, being able to access your tutors in their office hours - These are all things you won't have/be able to do in TAFE. Taking advantages of these facilities can be the difference between a great time and a terrible time. My SO was bullied in TAFE, and there was literally no-one to go to about it. Everyone just 'not my problem'd it, there just wasn't the infrastructure there to handle anything but administering classes. I saw the same thing happen to other students when I went to TAFE.  3) The class content is different. Lots of people will attest to TAFE classes being more 'hands on' and uni classes being more 'theoretical', and this is generally true, but there's more to it. In TAFE your classes will be focussed on producing a thing, in uni the classes will be more focussed on questioning what makes a thing good, bad, interesting or relevant. But here's the kicker; in both courses you'll be expected to produce a thing. So that means that while in TAFE you've produced your thing in class, in uni you're going to have to learn most of the practicalities on your own, or with your new buddies. In other words; In uni you'll be expected to work outside of class, in TAFE you will not.  TL;DR: Tafe and Uni are different beasts. In both cases you'll get out what you put in, but there's almost definitely more avenues for doing more interesting stuff, both socially and academically, in Uni. Having said this, I had a great time in TAFE and I'm sure you will too - just keep in mind that to get the most out of it (as with anything in life I suppose) you're going to have to extend yourself! :)."
Adelaide,3atqjx,q51,3,Wed Jun 24 05:03:59 2015 UTC,"My degree has this collaborative effort with the TAFESA Tea Tree Campus. Essentially students who enrol in these production based majors would spend 1 day a week at TAFESA and learn from their curriculum. Students would essentially learn from a TAFE certificate course and graduate with it credited as a major. If you're interested, it's the University of Adelaide Bachelor's of Media production majors. There's even one for VFX I think.  At university, as you're forced to be in constant contact with hundreds others, it'll be a decent social experience. Some people are social butterflies and some others tend to be quiet. It depends on what you make of it. Don't think get fooled by American portray of university lifestyle though, it's nothing like that.    At TAFESA, from what I've seen and talked to about from TAFE teachers, TAFE classes are like a typical year 12 class. A class of about 20 students who all know each other and they'd work together on whatever the days lessons are. Some will become great friends and some others will only be classmates.    From my experience at both campuses, I enjoyed being at TAFE A LOT MORE than university. I loved learning their curriculum, I loved their teachers, and I loved their campus. I actually have massive regrets going to university after getting so much out of the TAFESA program. The social experience is what you make of it. Both environments favour social interaction. Being at university will inevitably catapult you into a world of interaction with hundreds others. But don't assume TAFE doesn't have a social experience at all.    If you have any questions, I'm happy to help because I'm so much more proud of excelling in the TAFE program than everything else from university."
Adelaide,3atqjx,SugarCraving,5,Wed Jun 24 09:39:11 2015 UTC,"Not really. TAFE is about going to school to get your certificate/diploma and that's about it. Extracurricular activities are almost nil. This might change between campuses and courses, but in general TAFE does not have the social aspect that Uni does."
Adelaide,3atqjx,SparkyRailgun,2,Tue Jun 23 13:33:49 2015 UTC,"If you're thinking of doing VFX, you might want to rethink socializing. ;)"
Adelaide,3atqjx,naeem151287,3,Wed Jun 24 00:34:51 2015 UTC,"To me it was. Having actually done both. The cool thing about Tafe is most classes are tutorials, (Depending on course) so you get a lot more one on one time with the teacher. Very friendly too.  Also I think you might under the impression that uni in Australia has some great American sort of vibe to it. It doesn't. Plenty of clubs to sign up to if you wish to meet more people which are awesome but most people are just there to study and leave."
Adelaide,3atqjx,Sitin,4,Tue Jun 23 21:41:08 2015 UTC,My university experience was awesome. Hanging out at the cafe/bar/gym/lawns/etc - I wasn't just there to study and leave. In fact it was basically five years of socialising with a few classes in between.
Adelaide,3atqjx,hydr0xide,2,Wed Jun 24 00:23:50 2015 UTC,"Right on man, glad you got so much out of it."
Adelaide,3atqjx,Sitin,2,Wed Jun 24 01:22:25 2015 UTC,"As /u/Sitin pointed out though, for a bunch of people that's not necessarily true. You can absolutely have a good time at uni, but I'd say you do have to put some effort into making that happen - a bunch of people seem to rock up for tutes and that's the extent of it."
Adelaide,3atqjx,Fire525,3,Wed Jun 24 07:30:43 2015 UTC,"No socialising difference between either. Socialising is what you make of it, no matter where you are. On the social side of it, there will be young, mature & middle aged studying at both. TAFE will just have a lot more people who are goal-oriented and interested in taking real applicable skills out of what they do in the class room, where as Uni will have a lot higher percent of those who just want to engage in debate and argument for the sake of it, as it avoids doing actual work. The one big difference you'll come across is the vastly higher number of people you will meet at TAFE who have been employed full time already & have some actual life experience in that regard.  On the education and class structure side of things, TAFE is way more about learning what you need to do for direct employment applications, where as a huge chunk of Uni is theoretical wank depending on the type of degree you are doing. There's no guarantee a big money University will have the same quality of learning tools, equipment and course materials that a typical TAFE will have, either, for the type of course & subjects you are doing. Every facility (Uni or TAFE) is different & has different fields of expertise they dedicate their budget to, at the obvious cost of others.  My advice is to go and have a walk-through of the facilities at any of the places you are considering attending and see for yourself what they offer. Ask to see one of the classes in action if possible. Uni's & TAFE are generally pretty good with helping you out with that sort of stuff before you apply to attend. Take into account things like travel time, course costs, learning material costs, the quality and experience of the lecturers, etc....."
Adelaide,3atqjx,Octopotamus5000,1 point,Wed Jun 24 02:41:57 2015 UTC,"You'll learn something new in both. I went to tafe in WA and found that the classroom was generally dumber. If you aren't academically inclined you'll have a better time at tafe since the study isn't grade oriented, you just pass or fail (pass or pass I mean). I am currently attending university of Adelaide and the infrastructure and quality of students is much better. Remember that the prior comes with a significant money and time investment, you can pretty much be employable with a year in tafe and start earning; so maybe that could be a factor in your decision. Don't expect the Uni experience from tafe though."
Adelaide,3atqjx,imerp,2,Wed Jun 24 22:00:39 2015 UTC,"For some people, there's no social aspect in uni, other than forced groupwork. It's hard to avoid all the stuff that goes on on campus though even if you are really antisocial."
Adelaide,3atqjx,YourPassportNumber,0,Tue Jun 23 15:18:51 2015 UTC,"Some people find TAFE better for learning, some find Uni is better. For me I preferred TAFE as it was more structured. Uni you pretty much have to manage on your own within a framework of lectures and tutorials. Some TAFE subjects have lectures but the numbers attending aren't as high as first-year Uni. A lot more 1 on 1 at TAFE in class unless you seek help outside class at Uni. If you aren't so socially inclined seeking help at Uni isn't easy.  Uni is generally expected to have a much higher drop out rate than TAFE across the board. The extra social aspect of Uni I think is a contributor towards this as its easy to get lost in distractions where TAFE keeps you more focused.  In the end its about training and education. Off campus on the weekend the world is still out there to socialise in. Uni and TAFE students do intermingle at various events/venues around the CBD on weekends."

Adelaide,3as3gd,wordplayar,-6,Tue Jun 23 03:16:32 2015 UTC,It's got nothing to do with political parties. LibLab are both shite in SA. It's a broader problem with how things are being handled and that includes getting tourists to visit. The amount of money lost with these drops in visitors is huge and costs jobs!
Adelaide,3as3gd,insanopointless,-6,Tue Jun 23 03:28:09 2015 UTC,"I intend on posting thing in r/adelaide that the Tiser just wont report on. Like job losses that aren't being reported and the general fucked up state of SA right now. The Tiser are in the pocket of SA politicians and it makes me sick. Of course bad news stories dont sell as many papers but as the ONLY mass circulated newspaper in the state, they have some moral responsibility to report the truth. I would actually like to come back to my home state one day and I am extremely bitter about the current state of affairs. No I am not a liberal - happen to be a Labor voter but there is only so long one can put their head in the sand and pretend things are OK."
Adelaide,3as3gd,h1ckst3r,6,Tue Jun 23 02:18:36 2015 UTC,"I would say that AdelaideNow and most Murdoch papers are generally anti-Labor governments in most cases. The media here is fairly interesting lately, for a few reasons.  The SA opposition is poorly organised enough (Jay, for his typically quiet demeanor, is a formidable politician) that there isn't much of a counterpoint to what Labor is up to. Labor has also shifted economically to the right a bit which suits Advertiser's ends.  The Advertiser, being the biggest game in town, typically gets all news ahead of time, often in the form of a private briefing. So it's not necessarily 'being in the pocket of' as 'being in an advantageous relationship'.  I've also noticed a shift in certain parts of the paper in that rather than taking a combative view to everything, they're actually encouraging a collaborative spirit. Which I think is the right thing to do, because we're fucked if we don't.  Just for your knowledge, everything I hear out of state gov is that they typically prefer what's written in InDaily about them. However, they also have the view that barely anyone reads InDaily (not entirely true but relatively less, sure). In that sense, the Tiser is a much better tool for them to get their word out there. For what it's worth (note that I work for the same company that publishes InDaily), I prefer InDaily's content for the most part, but it's not perfect. No paywalls which is a big plus.  In any case, less people visiting has precisely nothing to do with the following things: What government we have, what media are writing about, what you and I are doing on a day to day basis.  It has everything to do with: SATC's efforts, individual tourism companies' efforts, airlines, airports, travel time, and an infinite number of other obscure factors.  My real problem with the state is that everyone is so protective of their own little corner. Every department or organisation or business is so siloed off and self-interested that you have people actively working against each other when they're trying to do the same thing. How many agencies do you have with their own SA tourism blogs? How many advertising places are out there making commercials or magazines or whatever that have no bearing on actual visitors or whatever? How many of them all pat themselves on the back for not really adding any value to the state? Plenty.   Adelaide is small enough to basically act as a walled city-state, which is great in some ways and also manifests itself terribly in other ways.   There are plenty of other factors that could be to blame though. I mean, it could simply be a readjustment - believe it or not, the Barossa Dirt ad actually was a huge success for the state. Or it could be too hard to get here. Wait until the Adelaide Airport upgrade and there are more directs heading to ADL."
Adelaide,3as3gd,jorcoga,4,Tue Jun 23 08:16:57 2015 UTC,The Tiser are in the pocket of SA politicians   Have you ever actually read the Advertiser? Or any stories on AdelaideNow?  They are as anti-state government as you can get.  I remember just recently they ran a front page story blaming the State government for pension reductions from the Federal government.
Adelaide,3as3gd,KNuCK13_70P,0,Tue Jun 23 03:51:31 2015 UTC,"Nah, they have nothing (and I mean nothing) on the Eastern states Murdoch papers there. There's definitely a bias toward the Liberals but it's not in the rabid, let's run a front page on a minister's expensive belt way that the Courier/Tele/Hun go for."
Adelaide,3as3gd,KNuCK13_70P,2,Wed Jun 24 03:40:21 2015 UTC,"SA has been going down since Abbott won the federal election. This is not a coincidence as all states receive their funding from the federal government. One of the first things that Abbott did was to significantly cut funding to SA which the state government was relying on.  In regard to jobs, the federal government's (both Labor and Liberal) eagerness to create more and more free trade agreements over the years has meant that local industry is no longer viable as goods can be produced much cheaper overseas where they do not enforce minimum wages. This means that eventually all industry in Australia will cease to exist as no one can afford to pay their workers to manufacture the goods at a competitive price.  If FTA's were abolished and the cost of foreign goods was at a similar rate to local goods, eventually demand for the local goods would increase and their price would drop. The theory, for example, is that the cost of setting up the factory to produce 1000 units is a similar price to 100 units so the overall cost can be spread amongst more units, hence lowering the end price to the consumer.  The combination of the funding cuts and the damage that FTA's have on our manufacturing industry is the reason why SA is going down. We were once the manufacturing state and our economy relied heavily on that, but since manufacturing is disappearing the hole that has left in the economy is really showing.  I haven't read the advertiser for a while, but I wouldn't have thought that they would be on the side of the Labor party. The Sunday Mail is certainly biased to the extreme right and against the state government. But then again, the Labor party keep moving to the right anyway..."
Adelaide,3as3gd,KNuCK13_70P,-1,Tue Jun 23 02:50:12 2015 UTC,"I am sorry I cant take you seriously when you begin with ""It's all Tony Abbott's fault"". I will start off by saying I am a member of the Labor party in two states, I volunteer and donate each month. However, I do not agree at all with your assessment. Victoria is also a manufacturing state and is hurting just as much in that sector. What SA politicians have failed to do is show any leadership or vision on this issue. Everyone sat on their goddamn hands for too long and now we're in this mess. Has Tony Abbott's government made the situation worse? Yes, certainly. But the problem didn't start with them.   I personally do not have anything against FTA's. SA just failed to make ANY kind of meaningful transition from manufacturing to a more specialised economy. The opportunities were there, they just weren't taken up and followed through. What's the point of fighting for a dying industry anyway? Why not aspire to something more than manufacturing?   Look at WA for example. There has been quite a downturn in mining and I know plenty of people myself who have lost jobs. However, the wheels were put in motion already for a transition to a more specialised services based industry. Out of all the companies I have worked for in WA, all but one had offices in Singapore, Philippines and other Asian countries.  A perfect example of how absolutely anti competition and anti innovation the Labor government in this state seems to fucking be is the training program being awarded to Tafe SA almost 100% (the real figure is 95% but fuck it may as well be 100%) which is killing many private training providers who actually DO A BETTER JOB!!!! SA Labor is too busy trying to sure up its next election and every decision is about marginal seats and saving failing institutions like Tafe SA.   I could go on..but I just upset myself with this."
Adelaide,3as3gd,NotAllThatWitty,1 point,Tue Jun 23 03:00:43 2015 UTC,"It may not be all Abbott's fault, but he certainly made the situation a lot worse in a very short space of time.  I didn't know there was a ranking system where manufacturing was low on the list. Why shouldn't we produce our own goods for our own people? Why do we need to buy foreign goods? We have the ability to be self sufficient in Australia, but we keep signing new FTA's which prevent us from achieving that.  FTA's bring a global competition to a local economy where well established and extremely powerful foreign corporations can operate at no disadvantage. Local business, unless they are also at a global scale, cannot possibly compete with the major league players and eventually fail. This is exactly why manufacturing disappears, along with the thousands of jobs that it provided. Higher unemployment means that less people are spending which also effects the economy. Less spending leads to less retail which leads to more unemployment.  We should never see low end jobs as a lack of progress or achievement. Low end jobs are just as important as high end jobs and we shouldn't just send them offshore just because it's cheaper. They should almost be seen as a service that provides work for the otherwise unemployed who will then spend their money on goods and other services which keeps the economy working. Exponential growth is a stupid idea as nothing is infinite. We should instead aim to reach a sustainable level and maintain the economy."
Adelaide,3as3gd,foul_ol_ron,0,Tue Jun 23 04:03:21 2015 UTC,"We can't fight against something that is already so long and well entrenched in this country. We opened up our borders to trade long long ago and FTA's have been in place for decades. What we need to do is find solutions now that this is the way of the future. I have no problem with highly specialised manufacturing. I think the subs and car manufacturing should be saved and kept within Australia. I think it is also a matter of national security that we not lose these specialised skills. What if we need them in times of war? All that aside, we just cant compete with these other countries in manufacturing terms. They produce at SUCH a lower cost than us. Even if we didn't have FTA's in place, it would still be hard for us to compete with tariffs on their products.   My father is a builder so I by no means come from a family that was employed in highly skilled roles. I empathise a lot with the people losing their jobs in these industries. However, both LibLab need to show more leadership and vision in developing other industries. I do applaud them for getting the Nuclear industry debate back into the forefront and exploring what opportunities are available there. We can't rely on that alone, nor can we rely on Olympic Dam getting up one day because who knows when that will happen.   I just want to be able to get a decent paying job in my home state, same for my partner. I am not a hater, just want things to get better."

Basically, if a particular purchase is less than $20,000 it can be deducted immediately from that financial year's tax liability.  There are some rules and regulations that surround how the things can and can't be purchased.  Important thing to remember is, this is a deduction, not a gift.

In terms of ELI5: Your parents (the government) take a slice of your pocket money each year to pay for essential things for you (tax). This year, instead of keeping that money, they are going to give that pocket money back to you to pay for something that will help you make more pocket money. For example, a pair of sneakers to walk the local dogs. Or a lawn mower to mow lawns.  EDIT: A better ELI5 that is hopefully less ambiguous:  Your parents (the government) take a slice of your pocket money each year to pay for essential things for you (tax).

Adelaide,3anll8,australiaday2015,6,Mon Jun 22 07:14:35 2015 UTC,"And separate the ""I don't want to learn"" types from the ""I just need more help"" types."
Adelaide,3anll8,KillerSeagull,2,Mon Jun 22 08:23:29 2015 UTC,I think the biggest problem is what to do with the I don't want to learn. We need a serious amount of funding to go to early intervention so we don't get year sevens going to high school with a year 4 level education and then dealing with the behaviour issues from throwing that kid in there.
Adelaide,3anll8,australiaday2015,2,Mon Jun 22 10:05:44 2015 UTC,I think for a lot of those kids it because the course work seems pointless to them. I think having hands on stuff for these kids might help.  For example two kids I went to high school with failed pretty much everything besides tech.  One of the kids scored top of the state for the woodworking course (stage 2) when he was in year 11. The other guy dropped out in year 10/11 and did his plumbing apprenticeship in well under the normal 4 years (and yes the company started paying him full wage)
Adelaide,3anll8,KillerSeagull,2,Mon Jun 22 10:15:01 2015 UTC,"Real interesting idea. My primary school advanced a few kids when they were killing it and it seemed to work pretty well but I don't remember too well.  I got put forward a year in a subject in High School - skipped year 10 and went to 11. Did pretty well. Then did year 12 in 11 and fucked up pretty brilliantly. Well, I still passed, but it wasn't great.  Turned out to be a really good thing though, because it was a solid kick in the butt to work harder before I went full year 12. Ended up taking 5 subjects (could have taken 4) so my shitty grade from the year before got ignored and I ended up putting in enough effort to do a good job."
Adelaide,3anll8,insanopointless,5,Mon Jun 22 07:07:58 2015 UTC,"From what I can gather it sounds a bit different to just jumping up a year, because this system allows kids to shift between levels with more ease.   Probably a good thing, as it means if someone jumps up too fast they can ease back a bit as opposed to being locked into the higher year. Anecdotally I know a fair few Ignite kids at my high school ended up repeating Year 12, so I imagine having the option to drop things back a notch would be preferable.  I've been reading some stuff recently about theory of education and how grouping by age is an outdated way to teach, and it sounds like this system is aiming for a new take on it."
Adelaide,3anll8,Fire525,2,Mon Jun 22 09:56:57 2015 UTC,Part of the problem is also kids not being ready for high school. The current trend in primary school is to pass kids onto the next year level no matter what. This actually does them a dis-service as the learning gap just keeps getting wider and by the time they get to high school its nigh insurmountable. Sometimes being kept back to repeat a year is what they need to get them back on track and catch up.   another part of the problem is having kids raised by parents who saw school as a joke passing that same attitude on. If a parent doesn't take their education seriously why should they?  I do think the year level scrapping idea is great as it should hopefully keep kids interested and help the ones who really need it. Though earlier learning intervention programs should also be a priority so it doesn't come to this point in high school. But they can only do so much with the limited budget they have unless you can afford private schooling.
Adelaide,3anll8,aytakk,1 point,Mon Jun 22 19:40:13 2015 UTC,"I was in a primary school in Adelaide that tried this. We were streamed for Maths and English between years 5, 6 and 7.

Probably engaged students more having work that was appropriate to their level."
Adelaide,3anll8,pmam,1 point,Mon Jun 22 06:23:29 2015 UTC,"My primary school did a similar thing, although only between Years 3 and 4 (Possibly 5, although I don't think so).

Adelaide,3al3z9,DustyMentone,0,Sun Jun 21 11:55:50 2015 UTC,Brutal. They should make a little lookout point or something.
Adelaide,3akj8s,thegooch2015,2,Sun Jun 21 02:34:39 2015 UTC,"No.  The Chinese places here are full of untrained, unprofessional people who do not even take your medical history.  A number of places advertise that they have qualified massage therapists but in reality they have got hold of one Medical Provider Number which is used by all their ""contractors"".  A Medical Provider Number enables clients to claim on their Health Insurance - it is technically fraud."
Adelaide,3akj8s,OWL777,5,Mon Jun 22 12:17:44 2015 UTC,"No such thing exists in Adelaide. You can get the Chinese part of it, but not the ""good"" or ""quality"" side. These types of massage people/mobs/places only exist mostly either in shopping malls or someone's back room of their house, and consist of clueless foreigners and backpackers being paid illegally low amounts on commission as contractors (instead of employees). You literally take your life in your hands by going to one of them.  Just google search for a qualified massage therapist & you should be fine."
Adelaide,3akj8s,Octopotamus5000,2,Sun Jun 21 05:49:23 2015 UTC,"thank you for your replies. if we go to a qualified massage therapist and have top notch private health insurance which covers massage, how many massages can we get per year (month, week etc?)?"
Adelaide,3akj8s,GlF_JlF,3,Sun Jun 21 06:05:00 2015 UTC,"Generally you will have an amount per treatment and then an annual limit, which may be something like $30 and $500. The annual limit may be for massage alone or grouped together with other services like chiro.  Edit: and there are no good Chinese massage places in Australia. They are hit and miss at very best. Other cities have Thai massage which is generally a better product, but here is Adelaide they're just another dodgy Chinese massage joint with ""Thai"" on the sign. What you're looking for is a sport massage."
Adelaide,3akj8s,Sitin,2,Sun Jun 21 12:30:54 2015 UTC,It depends entirely on the coverage you get.
Adelaide,3akj8s,-potatosaurusrex-,1 point,Sun Jun 21 06:45:38 2015 UTC,"Out of sheer desperation and pain, I once tried a place called Chi Body Spirit in West Lakes shopping centre. I saw a man named ""Jack"" who barely spoke English but helped my body in more ways than I could have ever imagined (he knew so much about my body, issues that my doctors later took years to discover). I cannot imagine the hell I'd still be living in without Jack. My dad now visits him regularly for his own problems"
Adelaide,3akj8s,UnicornPenguinCat,0,Sat Jul 11 15:29:48 2015 UTC,"There are a bunch of Chinese massage places in Adelaide, I doubt you would need to go very far to find one. I have only been a couple of times (once at Glenelg, once at Norwood), but both times they were relatively gentle.. I know some of them offer different styles of massage though, so hopefully it shouldn't be too difficult to find what you're looking for.  Edit: Actually, I will add a word of caution to what I just said, kind of tying in with what someone has said below.. I'm not entirely sure what qualifications (if any) the particular masseuses I went to had, as no information was supplied about this. For that reason I was comfortable with a gentle massage (I felt nice, no damage was done, and it was relatively inexpensive) but I would be asking questions about qualifications before agreeing to anything more intense."

Adelaide,3aibrk,thetempest22,3,Sat Jun 20 13:35:07 2015 UTC,"I think that might actually be the reflection of nearby car headlights on the clouds. I know it sounds weird, but I used to see that all the time when I lived at Upper Sturt. When the cloud cover is low, and because there are a lot of hills in the area, the cars headlights sometimes angle upwards and reflect on the clouds.  To me it looks like there might be an intersection, or roundabout where there are cars turning, and that happens to be reflecting on the clouds."

Adelaide,3ahw15,Ninja_Fox_,2,Sat Jun 20 10:07:57 2015 UTC,Just look at Mt Lofty...they're still there. They don't seem like spotlights.
Adelaide,3ahp1y,FootballBallsack,14,Sat Jun 20 07:30:13 2015 UTC,"You'll find lots of people are staunchly anti-public transport. (See: tramline extension, Seaford Extension, OBahn, Electrification)  They claim it's too expensive, and that no one will use it, and then once it's done and crowded, start claiming it wasn't done well enough.  IMO Belair should be extended to Mount Barker via Stirling and Bridgewater, and the Tonsley Line should be extended to Flagstaff and Aberfoyle."
Adelaide,3ahp1y,h1ckst3r,9,Sat Jun 20 08:30:46 2015 UTC,"It used to run out to Barker via Stirling (Mt Lofty Station), Aldgate & Bridgewater.  Afiak, due to the route going around through Belair plus the amount of breaking required it wasn't all that faster than the bus, and that was back in the days of the old freeway."
Adelaide,3ahp1y,Hypatiaxelto,3,Sat Jun 20 08:54:59 2015 UTC,"Obahn electrification* is another good one that now can't be done without rebuilding a load of the bridges along the route. When the last liberal government had to rebuild a few of them (because they'd just gotten old), they were deliberately designed lower so that there wasn't room for overhead electric cables above the busses or any trams. Needless to say, they did it in the name of ""cost saving"", but it didn't actually save a whole lot at all, and will only cost us more now.  * I admit, I didn't see the comma after OBahn in your comment until after I'd written it."
Adelaide,3ahp1y,astalavista114,7,Sat Jun 20 09:05:57 2015 UTC,"Maybe, there's already a train station at Mount Barker and the old disused line is still there I think   http://i.imgur.com/QYXXmJp.jpg"
Adelaide,3ahp1y,Sinkust,3,Sat Jun 20 07:55:09 2015 UTC,"Most of that was sold to Railtrack Australia some years back, and they've stripped out nearly of the broad gauge (5 ft) track past belair, leaving only standard gauge (4ft 8 1/2in) track that the interstate main lines run on, along with the stations platforms anytime they've had to do work through them."
Adelaide,3ahp1y,astalavista114,2,Sat Jun 20 08:05:20 2015 UTC,It was only ever a single line past Belair anyway. When the freight line was converted to Standard gauge (from broad) it forced the Belair line to become a single track.
Adelaide,3ahp1y,immrmessy,2,Sat Jun 20 09:01:11 2015 UTC,"It was still broad gauge past Belair, and isn't anymore. That's the critical point."
Adelaide,3ahp1y,astalavista114,1 point,Sat Jun 20 09:02:24 2015 UTC,The single (only) track past Belair was converted to standard gauge
Adelaide,3ahp1y,immrmessy,3,Sat Jun 20 09:20:16 2015 UTC,"Yep. That's what using the past tense of ""is"" (i.e. was) to refer to the former state of the track past Belair being a broad gauge track means.  I think we are agreeing, and using different words to do it."
Adelaide,3ahp1y,astalavista114,8,Sat Jun 20 09:22:21 2015 UTC,"So it's worth understanding that all of the rail in Adelaide was once broad gauge, however for compatibility, all the interstate lines were replaced with standard gauge with the suburban rail left broad. The result is that between Adelaide and Belair, there are both standard and broad gauge tracks running side-by-side, however from Belair to Mt Barker Junction, there are only standard gauge tracks. (MBJ to Victor is broad gauge again). In order to get suburban service up to Mt Barker the whole distance from Belair to Mt Barker Junction would need to be replaced. Also, I'm not sure on the details, but given the windiness of that route plus the stations to factor in, I can't imagine it would much faster than the 50 minutes down the freeway."
Adelaide,3ahp1y,SavvyBlonk,3,Sat Jun 20 08:57:23 2015 UTC,"The 4000 and 3000 class trains can be gauge narrowed to standard gauge, because both times the government wanted to have the option to standardise the gauge (indeed, the new track that's been laid all over the place has a second set of chairs for standard gauge track). It'll probably be worth it in the long run, but I don't see it happening whilst South Road is being upgraded, simply because that will cause major disruption on the second of the two main north-south routes. However, once that happens, they can do a bit of fiddling around with track at Belair to reconnect the other side of the station back onto the main line, negotiate with Railtrack Australia for use of the standard gauge corridor (or just buy it off them, and lease it back - probably the better option for the state), rebuild all the stations that Railtrack have chopped up to make their maintenance easier, and Bob's your uncle."
Adelaide,3ahp1y,astalavista114,1 point,Sat Jun 20 09:11:41 2015 UTC,"The other thing to consider is that it is predicted the Adelaide-Melbourne freight route will need to be updated in the 2020s to be a more direct route and to accommodate double stacked carriages. Currently the plan is either a very long tunnel, upgrading the existing route, or building an entire new track that goes through the hills north of the city."
Adelaide,3ahp1y,horselover_fat,1 point,Sat Jun 20 14:42:28 2015 UTC,I did not know that. Huh. TIL.
Adelaide,3ahp1y,astalavista114,6,Sat Jun 20 21:43:05 2015 UTC,"With the tunnels now there really isn't any point. The train line takes a pretty winding route up there, heads down to Blackwood before looping back to Belair. it would take longer to take a train to Bridgewater than to drive or catch a bus.   Also past the Belair train station there is only 1 line and converting it to dual lines all the way to Mt barker would be incredibly expensive. At the current population there also isn't much point in spending this much for a rail service as there probably isn't the demand for it and it wouldn't be a very cost effective infrastructure project."
Adelaide,3ahp1y,suicidal_smrtcar,1 point,Sat Jun 20 09:27:13 2015 UTC,Yeah it takes nearly an hour to get from belair to the city
Adelaide,3ahp1y,Obelisk_Inc,4,Sat Jun 20 09:40:23 2015 UTC,"But it is a lovely route. I mean no one cares when they're heading off to work, but if I'm bored as shit I'll take the Belair train ride for fun"
Adelaide,3ahp1y,KillerSeagull,1 point,Sun Jun 21 06:36:25 2015 UTC,"A more suitable upgrade would be negotiating with ARTC who own the standard gauge line and converting the broad gauge belair line to standard, restoring the dual line to belair. Even if services were not extended this could significantly improve the service on the line. IT would not be too bad having one or two standard (or dual) gauge platforms in ARS and converting a small number of 3000s to standard gauge. Although its a whole new story getting them out to dry creek. Something would have to be worked out with the freight network."
Adelaide,3ahp1y,itssmacks_,5,Sun Jun 21 13:59:14 2015 UTC,"So I did some quick calculations on travel time:  The distance between Mt Barker and Belair stations by rail is approximately 33.5 km. I assumed a similar level of steepness, windiness (as in twisty-ness, not gusty-ness), and inter-station distances of the Belair line segment from Lynton to Coromandel, which is 6.5 km and takes approximately 10 minutes. At this rate, travel between Mt B and Belair comes to about 51 minutes. Add on the approximate 40 minutes from Adelaide and... I don't think a one-and-a-half hour travel time to the city is really worth reconstructing the full distance from Belair to Mt Barker Junction.  Even if we took the optimistic speed of the Seaford line (Noarlunga to Adelaide is 30.2 km in 42 minutes), it would still take 1 hour, 17 minutes, which is still significantly longer than the buses which take a bit under an hour."
Adelaide,3ahp1y,SavvyBlonk,5,Sat Jun 20 10:09:55 2015 UTC,"It's 55km via train to Mt Barker and as others have said it's about 38mins to Belair on the train which is 21.5km via train (11km via road) Mt Barker is about 35km via road, so and extra 20km via rail. The trip would take a very long time.  Murray Bridge is 96km from Adelaide Railway Station and takes 124mins on the overland."
Adelaide,3ahp1y,torrens86,1 point,Sat Jun 20 12:27:09 2015 UTC,"Can't we get faster trains?  Those bullet trains in Japan go at a crazy speed, and we can't even get a train to go as fast as an adelaide metro bus."
Adelaide,3ahp1y,wordplayar,3,Sat Jun 20 12:34:38 2015 UTC,"Fast trains require fast track. Which means minimal stations, straight track, no level crossings.   The fastest trains in Japan are for travelling long distances between cities, not for suburban commuting."
Adelaide,3ahp1y,horselover_fat,2,Sat Jun 20 14:37:07 2015 UTC,"Trains can't really go uphill or downhill very well, imagine a Japanese bullet train trying to go down through the Adelaide Hills, it could do it but it would be going 500kph once it got to the bottom"
Adelaide,3ahp1y,Sinkust,2,Sun Jun 21 10:14:18 2015 UTC,"The railcars are not the issue, the issue is the route of the track. Short of tilting trains that would most likely be out of the loading gauge there is not much that can be done short of realignment."

Adelaide,3ahand,circusactone,2,Sat Jun 20 06:30:46 2015 UTC,what do you mean by a bit late ?
Adelaide,3ahand,hellboy1975,1 point,Sat Jun 20 06:52:47 2015 UTC,Just over 3 hours there. 3 hours back. Seems like an overnight stay.
Adelaide,3adrox,Eggmont,15,Fri Jun 19 08:07:08 2015 UTC,"Let's just have one at a pub somewhere in town, make it casual and easy for people to come and leave as they please.  Happy to sticky a thread for this."

Adelaide,3adrox,werisar,1 point,Wed Jun 24 13:29:30 2015 UTC,Was thinking world's end the Saturday after next seems to work for people if you feel like throwing up a sticky thread.

Adelaide,3adrox,peckerbrain,-1,Sun Jun 21 13:58:46 2015 UTC,I just like to drink.
Adelaide,3adrox,AbomodA,-24,Sat Jun 20 12:16:30 2015 UTC,"Hi guys, I commented further down but for some reason i'm being voted into oblivion.   Just want to say I've called dibs on any girls at the meet up. Won't go above quota but do expect to have first selection. Not being rude but just think if we are having a meet up it needs to be orderly rather than everyone getting drunk then overstepping boundaries. Naturally as first dibs I am happy to veto if it's not appropriate to move forward.   Should be a good night, and suggest you call dibs too rather than jump around like a hyena with ADHD on the day."

Adelaide,3adrox,peckerbrain,-10,Sat Jun 20 03:43:53 2015 UTC,I dunno I've never had much luck because it's always a kabana-fest... I figure of we have designated chaps asigned to the limited girls then they will be less intimidated so it's win-win... in my experience of reddit meetups you get one girl and 7 guys approaching... I said last time we should call dibs in future and people agreed... that was a couple of years ago and I had a different username...
Adelaide,3adrox,AbomodA,6,Sat Jun 20 10:02:22 2015 UTC,"Just a thought, perhaps your personality and your attitude towards women is the issue?"

Adelaide,3adrox,ConcernedOctopus,5,Sun Jun 21 12:22:19 2015 UTC,"I might try that, planning to make a final thread tomorrow.  Depends who wants to put their real name to it like that, especially with the dibs guy and stuff"

Adelaide,3adrox,posty,-33,Fri Jun 19 16:22:06 2015 UTC,Well it would be the gentleman thing to do. Trust me I've been to these things before and the guys are usually jumping around like hyenas getting the attention of a couple of girls - it's scary. An orderly dibs system means the girl knows who she is going home with and she can relax a little more and have a little more confidence.  Now as I'm the first to call dibs I get to pick but if there is more than one chick you'd be best advised to call 2nd dibs
Adelaide,3adrox,katiesch,21,Fri Jun 19 14:50:22 2015 UTC,An orderly dibs system means the girl knows who she is going home with and she can relax a little more and have a little more confidence.          Not sure if serious........

Adelaide,3adrox,katiesch,18,Sat Jun 20 02:32:15 2015 UTC,He has to be 12years old. Because any adult knows thats not how the real world works.
Adelaide,3adrox,F4rsight,12,Mon Jun 22 11:44:29 2015 UTC,I'd suggest that if you do show up you don't mention your username...
Adelaide,3adrox,peckerbrain,-14,Sat Jun 20 08:44:14 2015 UTC,Why?  You do the right thing and use the dibs system and everyone gets uptight about it!  I'm looking forward to the meet up and expect those who have called dibs to be honoured.
Adelaide,3adrox,SaintZim2,8,Fri Jun 19 22:39:52 2015 UTC,Good lord you're an idiot.

It's extremely filling, tastes extremely good and is also extremely bad for your health, what with the grease and lethal doses of MSG and what not.   Pretty good value for $7.50 which is the advertised price but 90% of the time if you just walk past pretending like you don't know where to eat, they'll give you a ""special"" for $6. Even better!! And for you really frugal people, if you go just before they close (5pm weekdays, 9pm weekdays) they're willing to give you a even better price of $5 a plate :P it won't be as fresh but goddamnit it's still good."

They say they chose it due to frequency of crashes, which I don't have figures for, so I can't argue with. My gut feeling is that you'd get more crashes on the twisty bits between Mt Compass and Victor.  It seems like they chose it just because that's the only prolonged stretch where people are likely to be going near the speed limit anyway (putting it, say, just south of Mt Compass wouldn't help, as no-one's going 100 on those twisty bits)."

Adelaide,3a88gr,cmdrqfortescue,8,Thu Jun 18 00:20:12 2015 UTC,"I feel the headline misrepresents the statements made in the article. AEMO are the market operator, they're not a generation company or distributor. It's their job to make sure the grid functions properly. After all, the grid is an asset that belongs to everyone and is there for our benefit. They are not there to 'protect' the industry.  It's one of their jobs to make long-range forecasts of how a changing mix of generation and consumption might affect the grid. If they didn't do this sort of work, instead of generators whinging now in a few years it could be many thousands of customers when there is not enough reserve generation available to power the grid.  As others have pointed out solar panels and wall-mounted batteries are not a silver bullet. There will be many less affluent people who will be dependent on the grid for many years to come. Heavy industry and commercial will typically also need power supplied.  I've got solar and I love it, and I'll probably get a battery when they are mass-produced. It's clearly here to stay, and every kWh I make leaves a lump of coal or gas unburned, which is a good thing. But I'm not so naive to think it doesn't pose challenges elsewhere.  I expect that ultimately SA will have a lot more 'fast-start' gas turbines to cover the situations where extra power is needed at short notice. Those things might only run for 10-20 hours a year but they will make enough to cover their running costs, which are quite low (the sites are usually unattended and the plant requires minimal maintenance)."
Adelaide,3a88gr,pmam,-1,Thu Jun 18 04:18:54 2015 UTC,"Ahh, interesting! So this is basically AEMO doing their job. I didn't realise that. That being the case you're pretty much right that the link title is misrepresentative :) Hyperbole. It's a thousand times better than any other rhetorical technique.   I'm not so naive to think it doesn't pose challenges elsewhere   Agreed. It definitely does pose challenges, and those challenges may well end up in the current power companies (and/or power generation companies) shutting up shop due to lack of demand.  I'm playing devil's advocate a bit in this thread. I can't imagine a nicer problem to have than ""we need fewer power stations"", and the fact that it's happening to an industry full of such utter bastards is icing on the cake."

The best write-up I've read of the situation is this in The Monthly:  https://www.themonthly.com.au/issue/2014/july/1404136800/jess-hill/power-corrupts  A long read, but well worth it.

Adelaide,3a88gr,redjuvie,1 point,Thu Jun 18 03:48:42 2015 UTC,I have no love for the power companies but I think the fairly obvious implication here is that when residential solar power is able to generate almost 100% of demand the problem will be that the companies still need to generate some power and maintain the networks but with almost no income. They're going to struggle and we're going to suffer as a result.
Adelaide,3a88gr,hugepedlar,-2,Thu Jun 18 02:10:09 2015 UTC,Waaaaaaah the business model we have might fail at some point in the future. So do something different.  My sympathy levels here are literally zero. Power companies have fucked the people for more than long enough.
Adelaide,3a88gr,redjuvie,4,Thu Jun 18 03:08:23 2015 UTC,"Yes it's all very well cackling over the spiraling demise of the power companies but if that happens then we're all fucked. Solar is a naturally unreliable and variable source of power and requires more load balancing and management than traditional power. Who's going to build and maintain the infrastructure to do that, and with what money? This is going to affect us all, not just the fat cats taking less of our money every quarter."
Adelaide,3a88gr,hugepedlar,3,Thu Jun 18 03:31:59 2015 UTC,"Not necessarily. If the power companies go bust, the government can buy it back for a very low price and begin providing power as a public service again, like it should be."

You don't need to act as if any talk of how to do this reliably is intended as a threat to renewable energy and you'd do yourself a favour by looking into it a bit deeper rather than reading a headline and typing sarcastic ""waaaah"" crap."
Adelaide,3a88gr,liver_stream,-1,Thu Jun 18 05:02:03 2015 UTC,"Cheers, yeah, because I didn't read the article at all.  I was wrong about the role of AEMO, they're not a generation company, and I've said that in my comment above. At this point it'd be pointless to edit the link, so why bother?  At no point did I say it's a threat to renewables. I'm just happy it's a threat to power companies."
Adelaide,3a88gr,wordplayar,0,Thu Jun 18 05:44:18 2015 UTC,"As typical of this government, they totally just dismiss future trends. Power usage is not static. There is already a shortage of power in the city. I know for a fact that one business couldn't expand because there isn't enough electricity to their part of the grid. In the US they pay 8c Wkh  we pay over 32cWkh. The reason solar is able to supply enough power at the moment is because people are too poor to run their air conditioners. If power was cheaper I would run my heater during the night instead of having to wake up to a freezing house. What about the future of cars? They will be electric no matter how much this government hates electric cars.  If electricity was cheaper there would be so much industry could do, could have gone bit gold mining, but our electricity makes that pointless. Instead government makes it easier and cheaper to sell your businesses and leave the state. They could have finished the NBN and helped create more Internet businesses but nope we get more chain hardware stores because having something that the market has already saturated some how creates more business."
Adelaide,3a88gr,wordplayar,-1,Fri Jun 19 13:06:55 2015 UTC,"There's a lot of worry about available power being generated in the grid and all that. I just want to ask... why is it so terrible to not have the power on after 2-3am?  If everyone in the house is asleep and you don't have any issues that require constant access to power i.e. some medical device hooked up to you to help you breathe or help your kidneys work, is it really that inconvenient to simply not have power to significant sections of your house (laundry, living room, office areas) until the sun comes up? Your fridge needs constant power, and it'd be a pain if you were charging your phone, but the vast majority of people don't need power in most areas of their houses.  If you want power on after dark, you should be specifically paying for which rooms you want it on in, and the hours you want it on for. It'd be a much harder juggling act for the network than simply operating Torrens Island, but it's not impossible if we've got enough wind turbines. It's also not something that could happen instantly- we'd have to pay to have power management available on a room by room basis, and it'd take a decade before the majority of the properties in the state worked that way. But it sounds like a cheaper solution than paying for a constant coal/gas power baseload."

Adelaide,3a7rpb,shillingintensify,4,Fri Jun 19 01:52:42 2015 UTC,"The admin of 8chan has responded to the situation.  Perhaps you should add it to your OP.   On Tuesday, June 16, 8ch was in receipt of around ten takedown notices for a single thread on the /aus/ Australia board for offenses ranging from ""child pornography"" to ""revenge porn"".  The thread was >>>/aus/16660 ( archived: REMOVED[thread snapshot] ). I rapidly reviewed the thread and came to the conclusion that no child porn had been posted on the site, and that if any revenge porn had been, it would need to be deleted through the proper channels. That is, as always, photos would only be removed with properly executed DMCAs.  The copyright on photographs is quite an interesting subject, because the copyright of a photograph always belongs to the person who took it. So, for a selfie, the subject and owner of the photo are the same, but in almost all other cases this is not true.  When I informed the people in the thread of their situation, and that they could in fact get their photos removed with a DMCA, they went hilariously ballistic and even got into local publications in Adelaide, one (paywall), two (paywall) and three.  After a bit more email back and forth with one of the ""victims"" (I use this loosely, we're implying that a woman who smiled with her tits uncovered is at one time strong and empowered and another time a victim, of course) I discovered the actual crux of their complaints, which was hilarious to me.  The women sending me emails were not complaining to me about photos uploaded on 8chan at all, but actually were complaining to me about a screenshot of a directory listing of an unknown third party's local computer that that third party had posted on 8chan, shown below.  (archived REMOVED [pic of list of names] )  As was obvious to me but seemingly not the Australian ""Press"" or the Australian Thought Police, we do not have the power to delete things off of people's local computers, only photos uploaded onto our servers.  The board creator of /aus/ deleted many more photos than I would have myself of those actually uploaded in the thread, but him being Australian and afraid of SAPOL caused him to do so (God help him, for that Prison Island resembles Orwell's Airstrip One more with each passing day).  Indeed, you will probably never get the photos you are trying to suppress totally deleted from every website in existence, that's the cost of being a slut.  However, you can get them deleted from 8ch provided they are actually uploaded, and not just a picture of someone's directory listing is uploaded and provided that you follow protocol, which means emailing or mailing in a DMCA request.  Thanks for the laugh Australia, it was sorely needed after some events of the past week.   End quote."

Adelaide,3a8j3v,taniane,3,Thu Jun 18 07:32:07 2015 UTC,"Pillow choice will depend primarily on if you're a    Side sleeper Belly sleeper (not recommended) Back sleeper   Then further how warm you like it (or can tolerate it). Memory foam is great but can be too warm for some.   Best pillow I've found (for a side sleeper like me) is Tempur but others hate it. It also is a bit smaller than standard pillows and pillowcases are a bit 'roomy' on it.  If you're experience specific pain, discomfort or sleep problems see an expert who can help with knee or body pillows if needed to further relieve pressure.  As for actual physical stores - each is a bit disappointing but I found enough at David Jones in the city for my simple needs."
Adelaide,3a8j3v,taniane,2,Thu Jun 18 07:39:48 2015 UTC,"I'm currently sleeping on my side, already do the pillow in between the kness and stuff, but the head pillows I thought were comfortable for me which i bought from snooze and Myers just flatned within months, thanks for ur response"
Adelaide,3a8j3v,emesser,3,Thu Jun 18 11:15:11 2015 UTC,"Sore joints? Check Vitamin D at your gp just in case. Had sore shoulder before but with smaller firm Tempur pillow it is easier to 'embrace' which strains less your shoulder joint. Being EOFY there might be a special on which makes it not to expensive (rrp is a ripoff). Don't mean to spruik it but it's been wonderful after others in latex, down/feather and polyester... Don't hesitate to see a professional if your pillow ain't solving your problems."
Adelaide,3a8j3v,-potatosaurusrex-,2,Thu Jun 18 12:51:09 2015 UTC,"I used to get a sore neck as I sleeped on my stomace so my neck would be bent all night making it sore and tight, now that I'm on my side neck pain has gone away. But on my side I find my shoulders are taking alot of the pressure. I just need a good quality pillow that stays firm yet no to hard if u understand me. My microfibres ones keep flattening with in months"

You'll be given that piece of paper in the meantime.  Wait a few weeks, head back, and trade in your old ID for your new one.  I ended up taking two months to go and get it because I thought they'd notify me that it was there (they didn't). Hope this helps!"

Adelaide,3a38lb,Mister_Slick,9,Wed Jun 17 03:27:11 2015 UTC,Except the usual model is where the cops have discretion over what is recorded and what isn't.   It can go both ways.
Adelaide,3a38lb,posty,4,Wed Jun 17 04:09:59 2015 UTC,"They appear to be part of the radio system. A solution would be to legislate that the camera must be recording for the entirety of the shift, both audio and visual. The full recording should be lodged to the courts and defendants should be allowed access to the part(s) of the recording that the Judge sees fit to the case and not what the police seems fit. This would also include audio of the police receiving a call from dispatch or spotting suspect behaviour, conversations between the officers on the way to the scene or while in pursuit, conversations at the police station between other officers about the case weather in an official and informal basis and other accounts that police would not record.   It would also stop officers from being able to turn off the cameras, especially in cases of corrupt cops who would not want their actions recorded.  I'm all for body cams but they must be handled appropriately or you will have situations like a recent shooting in the US where a police officer turned off the body cam before drawing his weapon."
Adelaide,3a38lb,ScooberSteve,1 point,Wed Jun 17 04:30:02 2015 UTC,Maybe not the whole shift. Sitting there for 2 hours doing his weekly radar camera shift is pointless. Plus I bet the cameras will be gopros.. The batteries dont last 8 hours. It should be turned on as soon as they arrive on the scene of anything.
Adelaide,3a38lb,Koadster,1 point,Wed Jun 17 05:37:05 2015 UTC,"If they are only turned on when they arrive on scene the officers motives and feelings on the way to the scene are not recorded. I know someone who was in a fatal car accident caused by poor weather. The first on scene police officer was recorded saying he was gonna make the other driver pay as soon as he heard because the person who died was a friend. Small country town by the way and other driver was passing through town. Shit like this is why they need to be on record through out their shift. A cop who is effected emotionally especially in country towns where there is only a couple of officers on shift at a time and are emotionally invested in the town can have poor judgment in times like this. Unless another officer puts their career at risk by recording fellow officers in these situations their actions and words can not be held accountable. By taking it out of the officers hands and having every moment of the shift recorded and submitted to the courts if they do anything in that shift that could possibly make it to court, even if it is just audio makes the officer accountable for their actions on their shift.   It was lucky that the other officer who was a british imigrant and had been recently stationed at this country town was the other officer on shift at the time and recorded the other officers conversation  between the two of them, the first on scenes report was scutinised and found to be falsified to look negatively towards the other driver. First on scene was given a suspension and my friend was found not guilty."

Adelaide,3a38lb,try_____another,1 point,Thu Jun 18 05:04:35 2015 UTC,"God, fuck being on patrol if everything you and your partner chat about in the car is recorded. The job is very gritty and if you put half the stuff you talk about on to paper, it would look terrible.  There's also the other issue of victims of crime being interviewed. It's distressing and embarrasing enough as it is for victims, imagine that you were crying and shaking after being robbed, assaulted, raped etc and you had a camera in your face that couldn't be turned off. Awful.  If the norm becomes the camers are used routinely for stuff like traffic stops, public order and stuff like that, then I think it'd be fine. If the camera was turned off without good reason on a job like that, I'm pretty confident our Magistrates wouldn't take any shit. This isn't the USA where your camera can 'malfunction' while you beat the shit out of someone.  The final problem I see with the cameras that non Police won't really understand is that sometimes the best solution for a job for everyone concerned sits in a bit of a procedural and sometimes legal gray area. They even explicitly tell you in the Academy that ""this is the 'proper' way, but you'll learn the real way on the road""."

Adelaide,3a0wqf,mrsboombastic,29,Tue Jun 16 10:39:20 2015 UTC,"You know, if the girl who first shared this on facebook didn't share it, you'd probably all be going on about your day normally like nothing happened. It's only blown out of proportion because it's been pryed open by people who have no idea what's going to happen when they share it. If it wasn't shared, maybe only the 50 or so people who actually browse 8chan in Adelaide, if that, would have seen it if they went on the site while it hadn't 404'd yet. Now you've got news outlets reporting on it, meaning every 15 year old and their brother will be on the web looking for it now, and finding it easily enough."
Adelaide,3a0wqf,-MilkWasABadChoice,21,Tue Jun 16 11:21:07 2015 UTC,"For real. I've seen multiple Adelaide nudes threads on 4chan over the years, but as with any chan thread, they taper off and 404 within hours. But by publicising how bad this is, they're literally stopping it from ending."

Adelaide,3a0wqf,AbomodA,2,Tue Jun 16 11:28:13 2015 UTC,"I didn't mean it like that in that way, what I was saying is that it shouldn't have been posted to facebook for their friends plus friends of friends who've seen that it's been liked/shared etc. That's what's turned it from a thread that's rarely ever made on a website that no one visits into this fiesta now."
Adelaide,3a0wqf,-MilkWasABadChoice,5,Tue Jun 16 11:34:51 2015 UTC,"It shouldn't have been shared publicly. But if I was on the list, I'd want to know. So private messaging the people in it and keeping it quiet would have been the best thing to do.  Either way, it's shared now. As far as I'm concerned, the best thing to do is to make it clear that as a society, this kind of shit is not ok.  If you have nude/risque photos of someone - don't share them without permission."

My whole family now knows of my shame.   The 150+ friend requests and 50+ messages from mostly people I don't know was ridiculous. Not to mention the shaming I got. It's ridiculous. I've reported the photo as child pornography 3 times and still nothing.   Thanks news, helping a lot. Tonnes."

Getting blamed for trusting someone? That's bullshit."
Adelaide,3a0wqf,smallangryrabbit,3,Wed Jun 17 04:50:50 2015 UTC,"It really is a horrible way to learn. People I thought were my friends are spreading cruel things about me and saying them to me also, it's disgusting.   I'm sick of seeing guys victimising themselves by saying ""because of you assholes no girls are going to send nudes anymore"" like shut up. My ENTIRE FAMILY has seen me naked and had someone claim they have a video of me that doesn't exist. But like they believe that. They can't even look at me and I can't look at them. I'm just praying to a God I don't believe in that my possible future career in the army won't be ruined by this. Because if it is I swear to god I will move to Canberra and cry until I die."

How dare she enjoy her body! How dare she send a photo to her ex! Everyone attack her!""   I'm just sick of people.   I've had more support over a silly comment I made on reddit than from the people I know and love(d). I've had ONE person (the one person I know will always stick by me) actually stick by me.

I'm (probably) a bit older than you and I experienced quite a bit of bullying when I was younger (mostly 17-18), but I can tell you that it did get better, and I would be very surprised if anyone involved even remembers what happened now.

Adelaide,3a0wqf,AbomodA,5,Wed Jun 17 09:21:57 2015 UTC,"Social media 101 - bunker down, respond to no one (at least with your real identity) and weather the storm. Do not feed the trolls, go to ground and wait it out. There is no winning engaging with the cruel trolls. And you know what? After a few hours and then a few days off social media you will realise what people say online begins to matter less and less.  Ever missed a whole day of Twitter or Facebook? Did you miss anything utterly crucial? Social media detoxing is really healthy and gives you a new perspective for the value of getting OFFline now and again.  Bunker down, you've got the right idea, maybe don't deactivate, but don't engage and don't keep fanning the flames by responding."
Adelaide,3a0wqf,Speaktomenow,1 point,Wed Jun 17 09:14:29 2015 UTC,I haven't responded to anyone. Except the people who genuinely care if I'm okay and the person that first told me about it. Otherwise I've just been flooded by people with disgusting things through messages. I've deleted all unwanted friend requests (all of them) and ignored messages and blocked the people that were threatening and hateful towards me.   I've re-activated because within 20 minutes I got 8 texts asking if I was thinking about suicide lol. Plus I have a lot of people on Facebook that I genuinely feel the need to keep in contact with through this.   Thank you though :)
Adelaide,3a0wqf,lanadelghey,2,Wed Jun 17 04:39:41 2015 UTC,"I feel so silly for being upset about it, but it's horrible. I just don't understand how people can be so cruel.   A mixture of jealousy, self-defence, and puritainism.  Some people will be cruel because they think you really did something wrong (and when you get right down to it, because they think you offended against God/women's proper place/female solidarity in opposition to porn/whargarble, all of which prescribe surprisingly similar rules).  Rather more will be angry that you're (presumably) getting laid and generally having fun, while they're not. Some of those will be your male peers who at 17-8 will generally be less attractive to young women than vice-versa, but others will be either less attractive or more inhibited women (and they're even nastier).  Thirdly, there'll be quite a few who want to fit in with one of the other two groups (especially if your family/community is fairly socially conservative) and are hoping that by viciously attacking you no-one will suspect that there's pics out there of them.  Lastly, there'll be some who just want to justify themselves in trading these pictures.  OTOH, your grandchildren (if you have any)  will probably think this is all a lot of absurd fuss over nothing, because sending nudes is just a slightly awkward thing kids do and its not like you were sending 3D scans of yourself (or whatever it is they'll be hoping you never find out about)."

Anyone who turns someone in for such breaking such an insane law needs their head examined, but a parent who thinks the criminal justice system is an appropriate replacement for parental authority for what is really only a minor act of self-punishing misbehaviour (if you even see it as wrongdoing at all) doesn't deserve to be a parent."

There was only one photo and some douche claiming he had a ""video"". If there were any more I never saw, and I doubt there are any more of me that anyone would have.

I've been humiliated, abused, threatened, and betrayed.   I think I'm pretty right in being upset about that. If you think otherwise, well, obviously your brain doesn't work right and you're not worth continuing a conversation with.   It's not about my body, I'm far from ashamed of my body.

Adelaide,3a0wqf,ikarka,2,Thu Jun 18 06:37:36 2015 UTC,I totally agree with you. That is why the news outlets should have publicised how concerned people could find out if they were on it. That way no one would have to go to the site and give it more traffic.

Adelaide,3a0wqf,try_____another,0,Tue Jun 16 11:08:05 2015 UTC,"500 is an enormous number for such a small city.   I CBF going through the list of names but I know there were openly-published Adelaide-specific (and for every other worthwhile-sized town or city) collections of stolen/leaked/retained (mostly genuine) amateur nudes at least 10 years ago. Some are simply people who had posted on GW sites and been recognised, or sent out in chats or cam sessions, but most are probably kept by former lovers (and either taken by them or sent to them).  With that long to accumulate collections, and bearing in it is probably around a third of all young women (that's about the number in the UK, I'm assuming that it would be similar here) who will have sent such pictures to someone, it appears that it is  around 1 in 2000 young women (although it seems from some of the other discussions of this that not all of those sets contain nudes, some are ""just"" sexy images off Facebook etc.). IDK how that compares with other cities.  In years gone by I even came across a few girls I knew (and a few guys, although they were ones I know they posted themselves), although I've steered clear ever since I came across a girl I knew who was probably underage when the photo was taken."
Adelaide,3a0wqf,aytakk,2,Tue Jun 16 11:10:17 2015 UTC,We can't even be sure it is even people entirely from Adelaide doing it either. Wouldn't be hard to scour Facebook and instagram for public pictures from attractive people in Adelaide and use those.   I wouldn't be surprised if the people involved do this for multiple cities across the world as part of some sick game.   The revenge porn posters are likely opportunists who saw the chance to be nasty and took it.

Adelaide,3a0wqf,lanadelghey,0,Tue Jun 16 11:24:50 2015 UTC,"Oh, damn. I assume I'd know if I was on it though? I don't want to look at the thread and invade the women's privacy even more but I made some pretty dumb decisions when I was 17 and dating a total jerk and feel really worried :/"
Adelaide,3a0wqf,SpeciousArguments,2,Tue Jun 16 12:14:10 2015 UTC,"You'd know! I had 10 people message me about it before I even woke up in the morning.   I remember a LOT of the names I saw on there, so if you feel comfortable messaging me your name I can tell you. Even if it's just your first name I can tell you all of the people with your name that were on there (if any). A lot of the photos have been removed though, keep that in mind.   My photo was from when I was 17 too, I'm 19 now and it sucks!"

Adelaide,3a0wqf,Tilaurin,7,Wed Jun 17 09:49:54 2015 UTC,It's a pretty fair concern that girls have though. I really think the news sites could have provided the information that people would be contacted.

Adelaide,3a0wqf,nugget2012,4,Sun Jun 21 06:58:31 2015 UTC,Agreed just because a girl takes nudes doesn't make them her a slut. It just means she's comfortable with her body and the approved people seeing it. If she's sending it to someone with her consent I don't see the issue. People shouldn't be dickbags and abuse the trust of former loved ones. These people are ruining the awesomeness of nudes for everyone else.   Yes there's a question of good judgement of character here but what 17-20 year old has that mastered yet?
Adelaide,3a0wqf,try_____another,1 point,Thu Jun 18 05:29:59 2015 UTC,"I agree, I can easily say for myself that as a teenage girl I sent nude photos to someone that nowadays I wouldn't trust to hold an egg. I personally think that teenagers should be educated on nude photos. I know that sounds weird, but just chuck it in with the sex education. We're in a technology filled world where nude photos are not ever going away, however we CAN make situations like this go away if young people are educated on the dangers."
Adelaide,3a0wqf,Raxkor,3,Thu Jun 18 09:53:08 2015 UTC,"If you are over the age of consent, what you do behind closed doors is your own business.  Pure and simple.  I see nothing inherently wrong with taking nude pictures of your self and sharing them with whom ever you want to.  Go for!  Its a free country, live how you want to live!  I also get annoyed when others judge peoples sexuality and sexual behaviour.  If that is how people want to judge, well, then 100% of the population are sluts or he-whores, pure and simple (including me and surprisingly those who judge....).  But (Yes there is a but), please, please, please take heed of what has happened here - really think twice before pressing the shutter button on your phone and forwarding the picture.  Once its out there, its out there.  While what they are doing is not right in any way, shape or form, no manor of shaming will stop these perps from doing it.  They really don't give a stuff about your feelings and are probably having a right royal time behind their screens with all the attention they are getting.  All I am really saying is think twice before snapping, thats all (or seriously consider buying a Instax camera, or an old polariod and some Impossible film!).  Down vote away......"
Adelaide,3a0wqf,AbomodA,1 point,Wed Jun 17 07:17:25 2015 UTC,"Totally agree with everything you just said. Taking nudes and showing maybe one or two people you intended to show, awesome.

Adelaide,3a0wqf,SparkyRailgun,1 point,Wed Jun 17 12:45:37 2015 UTC,"It's alright, it's definitely starting to ease up thankfully. But I'm suspecting that's because I've blocked so damn many people.   I know! It's insane. I couldn't believe it either.  As far as I'm aware, the person that has the photos has pretty much gathered them through trading nudes with others guys (plus possibly getting them from the girls themselves), so they weren't really stolen. But the guys that gave them to him are just as scummy as he is.   My name wasn't on that huge list of people so from what I can gather mine was posted by someone else that just wanted to join in on the fun. Everyone on that thread is super shitty.

Adelaide,3a0wqf,MaxisDiedForYourSims,1 point,Thu Jun 18 01:21:30 2015 UTC,Definitely makes me feel worse.

Adelaide,3a0wqf,Goblinator,-8,Tue Jun 16 12:43:55 2015 UTC,"Here's what I have to say:  When will woman realize that whether they were seen naked by strangers isn't actually that big of a deal they're making it out to be? You realize their family probably didn't care or didn't know about these nudes till they complained about it?  But seriously, where's the harm? I see a picture, I fap vigorously to it, I move on to another picture and so on. There's not a single time where I stop to think about what these women do in their lives, and what their parents think of it.  The problem here is that these qt14s think they're the hottest shit on Earth, which is why they took nudes of themselves in the first place.  So they're basically scared that someone will repost their shit because they think they're so attractive and irresistible. Damn right someone will, but even that someone will get bored of it at some point, and move on to some other girl to fap furiously to. They don't even realize that an average jo like myself sees on average hundreds upon hundreds of naked girls on the internet every week.  They think it's devastating because they somehow think all these strangers looking at their nudes give a damn about them. We're not living in the 50s anymore; a picture of a naked girl isn't worth more than a 2 minutes fap.   Besides, 8chan is just a bloody image board like 4chan where you can create your own boards, like sub reddits. Revenge porn site my arse."

If you do indeed take pictures of your naked self, then you have a serious voyeurism fetish, and you shouldn't be mad that someone else also shares your fetish, and will enjoy fapping to your naked self.  Enjoy fapping to others and let others fap to you. It's a win-win situation."

Adelaide,39zo6n,RobertsSpess,10,Tue Jun 16 02:15:53 2015 UTC,"Yeah, what jaali says. I think it's a combination of factors.    degrees are overvalued now. This is the biggest one. Or perhaps I should say their value has diminished. It seems the bare minimum you need to even get entry level job is a bachelors. In some fields it's a masters or higher. A lot of Uni's have a reputation for letting everyone pass, having soft-ball courses, etc. So the value in those degrees has diminished. I'd also say a lot of degrees don't have the practical experience needed to work in that field. I've dealt with plenty of final year students who I wouldn't give a job to if I was hiring... Over supplied degrees. When you have 100 journalism graduates a year, and there's four jobs in the city, ten in rural areas in South Australia, what are they all gonna do? Fight over scraps. Over qualified Adelaide. Sure, less HQs here etc. Some of the big firms pay as well here as Eastern states, others do less because they expect your living costs to be less. Some like the big 5, Deloitte etc, will pay you based on demand... if you move states and they don't 100% need your job, you'll take a cut, either way.   Personally I found it worse in the US. 4 years of study = fast food job if I was lucky. In the end I was paying more rent than I was earning each month so I came back. I got a decent internship while there but that was another fight to the death scenario between four interns, and one ends up with a min wage job after 6 months. Not worth it. I didn't want to wade through half a decade of bullshit just to get a base level job in my chosen field.  Of course, there are exceptions. Some people get picked up straight out of uni. Some people make a good connection or good impressions during internships, some have family connections, some pursue a different field and end up fine. On the other hand I know plenty of people who are two years out of uni and haven't found a thing yet. It's all chance. I stumbled on my current job pretty easily, but the one before that took me 9 months of applying for jobs 9-5, Monday to Friday. Full time job searching. That's a shitty slog."
Adelaide,39zo6n,insanopointless,5,Tue Jun 16 05:01:16 2015 UTC,Don't post this comment in /r/Australia.. I said something similar about uni degrees and boy did all hell break loose. Never going to that sub reddit ever again.
Adelaide,39zo6n,Koadster,8,Tue Jun 16 05:30:41 2015 UTC,"Ah really? I thought it was a fairly common view. I'm all for education being cheaper / free, and I think getting an education is a great thing, but right now, in a lot of fields, it isn't a major help for getting a job (other than getting you to the very baseline).  I wouldn't say that's unique to SA or even Australia either. But Australia has its own problems with it.  Some Unis are great in certain parts, some have awesome research going on, some are great at getting their story out there... but I find almost all of them are letting their reputation slide down the drain a bit to cash in.  Lots of places in Europe take a pretty dim view of our certifications there.  edit: Again, I should point out that some degrees are still fine. But some are way over allocated. Some people will make the best out of their degree (can't say I did) and make a good thing out of an average one anyway. Real go-getters who smash internships from the very start, work experience, go and do their own projects to back it all up and get involved will usually do pretty well in the first round of job hunting because they've set themselves apart from peers etc."

Adelaide,39zo6n,insanopointless,3,Tue Jun 16 06:02:44 2015 UTC,"/u/insanopointless    Some people get picked up straight out of uni.   Yep. And some people think outside of the square straight out of uni. The problem I see with so many graduates, especially those who have graduated into highly-competitive industries, is their expectation that jobs will come to them through traditional means, e.g. they apply on Seek and get it. There is obviously a disconnect between industry and schools. And there seems too to be an unwillingness by graduates to be creative in how they approach their career, including canvassing left-of-field industries and positions."
Adelaide,39zo6n,paulygoo,3,Tue Jun 16 08:38:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you're right. Any creative flair or point of difference helps and that can include the methods of finding work.   My current job came about because of some overseas work I did while at Uni on my breaks + putting a couple of years in to photography which no one else in my field of study had done. Just enough to edge in front.  I've met other people who've got pretty amazing jobs quite young because they went around creating them, almost... whether it was internships that didn't exist or volunteering for non-existing positions during conferences that later became full time work, whatever.  I mean, you're competing against every other graduate really, which means you might be up against anywhere from 10-1000 people with similar qualifications. They'll all be applying on Seek for the same jobs at roughly the same time. Not including anyone else who already has more experience that might be going for those same ones too. It can be brutal.  My friend scored a great job with the ABC because he wrote to every single foreign office they had around the world, whether it was a proper office or just a stringer or something. Out of 100+, only one got back to him. I travelled to Japan with him, he did two weeks of experience (while I set up some freelance doco, photography & feature work that ended up working out awesome for both of us). When he came back and applied for jobs here in Aus when we graduated a few months later, their correspondent saw his name and vouched for him. He's spent three years moving all over the shop but he's in a really enviable position for his age now, and all that because of a bit of effort before Uni finished.  You're right on the disconnect. I think some courses are coming around now but there are plenty which have very little connection to the industry they're feeding in to, and it's stupid."

I suggested he send physical letters (not emails, which are so easy to ignore and delete) to employment associations outlining his interest and unique passion. Ten letters. Two interviews.

First month or two I was trying to stick to journo jobs, anything in that field, local media, rural, whatever. West Coast, based in LA (had family there) but prepared to go anywhere. Over time I expanded out, copywriting, marketing, etc.   By the end of my time I had a good photography internship at a commercial studio but I was looking for any old job.

The economy is in bad shape at the moment especially since the country spent the last decade riding on the back of a resources boom but has not had the foresight to anticipate the fall in prices. Investor confidence in other industries is low and a recession is on the cards i believe. Me personally, i have a degree and a diploma and 10 years experience in my field but recently lost my job and cant find work in my field.

Adelaide,39zo6n,thinkcupcake,2,Tue Jun 16 05:15:47 2015 UTC,"Yes with a but. While there are some larger mines ramping into production there are plenty that are almost complete. There is currently no investment insentive for new developments and commodity  prices dictate investment. Prepare to see WA suffer in the next few years as the market declines. I should know as mining was my background. Its a shame the renewable  energy sector is being scaled back as australia could really benefit from home grown technology. Solar and geothermal have huge potential here and re skilling workers from the automotive industry would have been a great opportunity imo. Fuck it, the country is stuffed. Lets all grow hydro."

Adelaide,39zo6n,sunshinebuns,1 point,Tue Jun 16 04:54:02 2015 UTC,"Unless your talking about bare bones entry level stuff, or basic admin work, degree's and diploma's mean nothing compared to relevant work experience with at least management-types backing a resume. Even with admin stuff I'm not even looking at education, rather than employment history.  I'd never hire a graduate or someone based on their qual's (other than they can confirm they have relevant qual's as a registered professional for example) for mid-level stuff, management or above. There's just no point. They have no proven track record, or proven ability in general at all. As a specialist a PHD may come in handy if it's relevant & a MBA has some relevance to it at least.  This is coming from the perspective as someone who hires directly from a company though. There are heaps of places out there though that just straight up use shitty recruiters instead of being bothered to do it themselves. Recruitment agencies are a different beast all together and you'll need decent admin abilities to get through the door, a basic understanding of how to manipulate a personality type test for the role you want - and then decent people skills above all else because recruiters just put forward personable people who they think will stay in a job for at least 12 months (so they get their sales commission) & aren't annoying to work with. Recruiters aren't looking for the next Bill Gates of your industry or someone overly technical in what they do, they just want someone they can sell to the employer as an acceptable candidate.  There's also no reason at all to get down on yourself if you end up being unemployed or looking for work for extended periods of time, in our current economic climate. There's literally not enough jobs to keep everyone employed. There's easily 100+ applicants for any job add listed these days & that means 98+ others including you didn't get the job either. You just have to keep at it. At the very least, recruiters are more likely to put you forward to candidates if you've done multiple short term or contract roles with them. They'll put you forward often just for being a personable & reliable person, and little else."
Adelaide,39zo6n,Octopotamus5000,0,Tue Jun 16 05:50:38 2015 UTC,"I understand experience is the key but trying finding someone who will take you on for work experience.

Adelaide,39zo6n,Octopotamus5000,1 point,Tue Jun 16 07:58:50 2015 UTC,"General volunteering is useless for the most part & leads to nothing unless what you are after is a referee for your resume. The only volunteering that will help is if you are a volunteer board member for a charity / non-for-profit. You can get some legit industry contacts through this method & often also via running major or charitable events from the marketing side of things (your basically just meeting or on the phone to people & collecting names/contacts - can get your name and face known by the right people).  Work experience is rarely if ever offered & for the most part offers nothing as you never get experience you'd actually need anyway.  The best option is just to take what ever temp or contract work you can through recruitment and temp places. It's cash for your  time and you end up spending a few weeks here and there all over the place until you can get the opportunity to interview for a real job. Unlike volunteering, it also pays the bills (a bit at least, anyway)."

Adelaide,39z7ou,kaeserdc,2,Tue Jun 16 04:11:38 2015 UTC,"Make sure your resume is short and sweet. Maybe make different ones for different industries, highlighting the skills relevant to where you're applying. Volunteer work is good to get a foot in the door for areas where you could use more skills.   For retail and hospitality, find out the most appropriate time (when the mangers aren't busy) and try speak to them in person. Be direct and to the point and confident.   Also make sure you're dressed appropriately and look the part. Some people get a bit stubborn about their appearance but if there's three people applying for the same job with similar skills it could push you over the line.   And if you don't get the job at a few places or they aren't looking, give it a few weeks and stop past again to say hello. Give them enough time that you're not pestering them, but this makes sure you're fresh in their mind if they need someone. Just having a manager remember your face is an advantage."

In smaller cities like Adelaide where we don't have critical mass, relying solely on an Uber car can be an issue. That said you're not too far out of the CBD but even then you might be waiting a while.  I'd be inclined to play it safe, and just check your phone that morning for future reference.  Another option, since all of the Uber cars are private hire cars, is to find one of those and check if they have any drivers at that time of day."
Adelaide,39zctd,paulygoo,1 point,Tue Jun 16 00:47:34 2015 UTC,I tend to monitor the time slot I need to book for a few days prior - to get a feel for whether there are usually cars around. I have resorted to taxis in the past for early morning airport runs due to a lack of availability.

Adelaide,39wgoa,Aardvark_Man,2,Mon Jun 15 22:26:07 2015 UTC,"Not 100% sure, but maybe try one of the places that hems pants etc.  It'd also depend on if it's vinyl or fabric or what as to what you'd need. Can't think of the name of any, but I reckon there's one in Marion if you go to the mid-level car park near the movies, and there used to be one between k-mart and the food court in Colonnades."

Adelaide,39vxu4,Koadster,2,Tue Jun 30 01:48:37 2015 UTC,"That'd be neat, I'm sure they'd be happy for that.  I think the plan is to give this first trial a go and see how people like it.

Adelaide,39we56,the_town_bike,7,Mon Jun 15 10:05:43 2015 UTC,"former KI resident here, moved from the UK straight to the island, like many rural communities it has its characters, some are the bogans and crazies but its mostly has decent folk. the island is very much if you can make money then its a great place to live. it is very isolated, it takes 1.5 hours to get to the ferry from the city then 45 mins on the ferry then 1.5 hours to Kingscote. its really hard to list pros and cons of the island without knowing likes and dislikes."
Adelaide,39we56,midget_on_meth,2,Mon Jun 15 10:24:22 2015 UTC,"I'm past clubbing, bit of a hermit these days, happy to live the quiet life and do whatever work there is around.  Does it get crazy around tourist season or is the island big enough that you don't really notice?  I imagine purchasing and having furniture delivered, whitegoods etc would be expensive and a hassle."
Adelaide,39we56,midget_on_meth,4,Mon Jun 15 10:56:16 2015 UTC,"it really is a chilled lifestyle and relatively cheap lifestyle, after all there aren't many shops to spend money at. although when it comes to buying things like furniture it is a hassle, unless you buy lots of things at once and have a ute to cart them over with it become really expensive. the island is a great place to be before and during the busy season (around Christmas) its seem to come alive. it feels like the tourist out number the locals which is great, you meet people from all over the world who are excited to be on holiday and just want to tell you about kangaroos and the rest of the island. then once its quietens down which is seems to very quickly its back to having the beach to yourself. when i was over there i had 2km of beach to myself. even if you don't move over there i would highly recommend spending a few days there, a car and a swag and your set for at least a week!"
Adelaide,39we56,insanopointless,6,Mon Jun 15 11:20:24 2015 UTC,"My uncle lives there. He's a bit older now (50s~) and has settled down, married a woman on the island in fact. He was pretty fed up with life on mainland and loves it there.   As others have said, nice and quiet. Lots of space to yourself. The beaches are empty most of the year. He used to have a spot on Emu Bay and would take his dog down and go fishing and would barely see another soul. He's moved a way away now. Worse views but better beach access.  Lots of kooky people on the island but mostly good. Some bogans, some people running away from life, plenty of decent people who just want to take it easy. I would say the majority (that I've met) would be tradies and the like. There's a few builders and whatnot on the island and an okay amount of work for people in that trade but it's up and down.   Tourism is a decent employer, there aren't a lot of shops but yeah. More high level accommodation opening there in recent years for the luxury traveller etc. Also seafood. Decent amount of crayfishing, abalone etc to be found off the island, not sure how that is going though. Seen quite a few premium food businesses etc start on the business, some premium farm type food and that, not sure how big it is though.  If you like the quiet life it suits well. Most of the year it's not too busy. You can always hit the pubs if you want, there's some good ones there though it's been a while since I've hit them up, Penne and Ozone for example.  Worth visiting. The island isn't big but it isn't small... so there's quite a bit to see and different parts have different vibes... and are different distances from centres and all that.  The ferry isn't cheap but as mentioned there's a decent resident discount which I believe you can give to friends and family. Ferry isn't the only way though, there is also an airport which does quick flights back and forth straight to Adelaide Airport (maybe beyond but I'm not sure).  Supplies do cost more than on mainland and you'll likely wanna bring gear on a trailer as mentioned, but there's some perks. If you make pals with the fishing crews you'll get discount crayfish and abalone haha. Biggest crayfish I've ever seen (restaurants don't want em! still tasty). Fishing and crabbing is pretty good all around the island, some of the best I've had in South Australia.  So yeah. Some people love it. My uncle has a dog, he's building a nice little house, got himself a wife and a runabout boat and he's in heaven."
Adelaide,39we56,Trezizi,4,Mon Jun 15 14:01:53 2015 UTC,"It's a great place, the people are nice and the biodiversity is incredible. But the only way to access the island is by an overpriced ferry which (i assume) causes the low house costs and high commodity costs (such as some fresh food) on the island."
Adelaide,39we56,Aardvark_Man,2,Mon Jun 15 10:27:32 2015 UTC,"Fair sure the ferry has a discount for residents, but yeah, still pricey for things.    I have friends that live over there, and my understanding is it's basically like any other group of small towns, just on an island.  If you like the rural life and can get a job, all good."
Adelaide,39we56,circusactone,2,Mon Jun 15 10:56:41 2015 UTC,Or by plane with Rex.
Adelaide,39we56,rulenumber303,4,Wed Jun 17 09:10:41 2015 UTC,"I don't live there but used to interact with quite a few people who did back in the nineties. A little clannish and isolated. If you piss everyone off badly you'll have a difficult time. There's a story (which may be an exaggeration) that they once sent a new  police officer packing because he insisted on giving locals traffic fines and defecting their cars. He started to have a difficult time everywhere he went on the island and with everything he did, for example shops were unco-operative etc until he asked to be transfered.   So to live there you need to be the sort of person who wants a degree of isolation but not the sort of person who universally annoys people.  The population is low in part because there's not a lot of industry or a huge amount of money made from farming. I mean... there is farming but the soils are very poor and the environment is kind of fragile and it can only sustain certain practices. There are a bunch of species that occur only there.  Really it just isn't a good place to exploit economically, and the cost of travel to the mainland both in time and money is significant."
Adelaide,39we56,insanopointless,3,Mon Jun 15 23:52:08 2015 UTC,"True story, probably 5~ or more years back. By the time he left everyone on the island knew his regular traffic hiding spots anyway so it wasn't so bad."
Adelaide,39we56,Sunflowerseeds__,2,Tue Jun 16 00:44:27 2015 UTC,I lived on KI as a kid for a few years. Best years of my life. It's really beautiful but I guess there isn't much employment which would explain the low population.

Adelaide,39tean,AussieITE,3,Sun Jun 14 16:23:16 2015 UTC,"A good artist will generally draw up your design first. Good free hand artists are hard to come by. If you explain what you want to your artist, they can draw it up before getting it done. It does sometimes cost to do this, especially if it's your first and the artist doesn't know you that well.  Expect to pay a deposit upfront. The amount differs between studios.  Lastly, always look at your artists prior work and choose an artist whose style matches your desired artwork. Artists generally have differing looks, much like painters, so find one that you like."

Anything to do with a mobile phone is specifically prohibited.  tl;dr concentrate on controlling the heavy piece of machinery.   Source: radio interview with senior officer.

No. It's very specific. The Act sets out exactly what is not permitted.   It's at the officer's discretion that you are driving 'distracted'.   No. There is no such offence. There are circumstances where a driver distraction may be considered a factor in a charge of Drive Without Due Care but these have nothing to do with Police discretion.   Reasons can be anything from eating or smoking to fiddling with your radio settings or scratching your nose.    None of those activities on their own constitute the offence.

(1) A person must not drive a vehicle without due care or attention or without reasonable consideration for other persons using the road.    Doesn't seem overly specific to me. Surely 'reasonable' implies some level of discretion is involved. I never claimed that any of the distracting activities were cause to be pulled over, just that they were all things that might cause one to be seen driving without due care.   I'm not going to argue the point with someone currently enforcing it, but I'm basing my response on a radio interview with a senior officer around the time of the long-range camera study, in which it was mentioned several times that it was at the discretion of the officer that whatever you were doing was causing you to not drive with due care."

Adelaide,39jzvk,marktx,2,Fri Jun 12 14:20:45 2015 UTC,It would be nice but I don't think we have the expertise here to make nuclear an attractive alternative to wind+solar+storage.

Adelaide,39jzvk,ApexRedditr,1 point,Fri Jun 12 17:09:45 2015 UTC,For nuclear to succeed in South Australia significant infrastructure upgrades will need to be made. Our peak load is so small that one small reactor would be around 40% of our peak (In the height of summer) load. For such a development to be economically viable the plant would most likely need to be larger than one reactor. The transmission lines to export power to Victoria would most likely need to be upgraded.  I'm not saying it's an impossibility but lots of things need to go right for nuclear power to be successful in South Australia. I believe that it is a good option.

Adelaide,39jo26,InexplicableRage,6,Fri Jun 12 04:56:52 2015 UTC,"The federal government is to blame with its FTA's and hostile policy towards local industry. This is not about party politics as both major parties are guilty of FTA's. The ""free market"" encourages us to buy the cheapest available product, which inevitably comes from businesses that have been set up much longer than anything in SA, or the rest of Australia. Local industry can't compete with the far more experienced international businesses which is why we're seeing a mass shutdown of Australian industry.  If the TPP gets signed, it'll get much worse, but all over the country. It won't matter which state you're in then, they'll all be screwed."

Slash taxes/offer subsidies for anything high tech, become the silicon valley of Australia.  After Sub Corp goes it wont be long before the other companies like it go, and with it all the jobs and employees.  Make it attractive for them to be here, and increase revenue from a higher population, instead of draining everything.    It's a solution the state government can implement without the federal government changing anything, and capitalizes on an existing, but ailing, industry."
Adelaide,39jo26,KNuCK13_70P,1 point,Fri Jun 12 14:03:38 2015 UTC,"Our strengths used to lie in manufacturing until the FTA's killed that. I think we should abolish the FTA's and become a bit more protectionist so that we can rebuild our industry. Nearly every major global manufacturing corporation that exists today experienced a period of protectionism in their own countries which helped them become ready for the global market. Australian owned businesses have never had that opportunity. Why are we importing everything that we consume when we're quite capable of producing stuff here?  Imposing tariffs on imported goods will put their prices higher than what local manufacturing is forced to set which will encourage people to start buying local goods which will, in turn, let the local manufacturers set lower prices, eventually. Not only that, but job positions will increase, unemployment will decrease and our economy will vastly improve. Tariffs will also improve the government's budget.  Also, on a slightly different note, why do we export food and then import the same types of food from other countries? Why aren't we consuming our own food first and just exporting the excess and simply not importing foreign goods that we don't need? FTA's, that's why. FTA's make global corporations richer while eliminating the smaller businesses that can't compete on a global scale."
Adelaide,39jo26,kombiwombi,1 point,Fri Jun 12 06:37:05 2015 UTC,"I disagree here on the lockouts. Yes they affected the scene somewhat, but realistically I think the nightlife suffering shows the impacts of the broader economy."
Adelaide,39jo26,jigsaw153,2,Sat Jun 13 12:58:47 2015 UTC,"What's happened is that a lot of long-term issues have come home to roost. These haven't been particularly caused by SA, but the centre of the storm is here.  Firstly, cars. Let's not kid oursleves: we don't have the volume to be efficient, and being owned by GM is no way to do niche manufacturing (if GM wanted to do that, they'd do it in a North American factory where they could manage it more closely). It's been plain since the 1980s that we either needed to get big or get out: the Button Plan was our plan to get big, and with its failure then we're getting out.  My concern here is that in getting out we're not doing pulling back all the efficiencies of not having a car industry. That's mainly because car dealers have their local Liberal Party MP in their pocket.  Secondly, manufacturing. We either need to be Germany or China, there is no survival in between. Here the state government has to take a lot of blame, because although their plan was to become Germany they made only window-dressing attempts at putting in place the depth of education and training needed to do that. The Federal government haven't been much better: its insane that I get better tax breaks for owning a rental property than building capital equipment.  Three, mining. Demand is cyclical. There are huge capital requirements, the availability of which is also cyclical. But we were going to be our properity upon this? No great shock that the cycles didn't suit us. What it did do was allow the state government to avoid facing up to the difficult challenges of transitioing the economy.  Fourthly, construction. This is how the SA government has been propping up the economy. See North Terrace for a prime example. Partly it's expedient, partly it's because the politics is SA is owned by property developers. But this simply isn't a long-run answer, all it does is to create overhangs of debt and space. It also leads to prioritisation of cash over amenity, as the government has done to the Port Adelaide waterfront in the past few weeks.  As to the future of the state. It's fucked. It's been clear since the 1980s that the major employers in Adelaide are all in indutries where Australia cannot compete. And the lack of effective action in that 30 years means that there's no alternative to the loss of those industries hitting heavily.  Your children are not going to get the sort of jobs you want them to have if they stay in SA. Get them the best education you can (and education is still something we do well, but not enough of). And then get them out.  Elizabeth is going to be the focal point of a slum unless the state government gets off its arse, but that's not the type of people or a problem they are happy to engage with."

Adelaide,39jo26,basefield,4,Fri Jun 12 08:52:46 2015 UTC,"Depends what you're in to. SA is getting double boned at the moment by some industries upping and leaving as well as others transitioning (as they are in the rest of the world).  We've lost a few big projects and others haven't quite worked out - Renewables was supposed to be really big here but that got hamstringed by the Feds, so it hasn't quite got to the point it looked like it would.  Research is still fairly strong, though overall in Australia that kind of stuff is getting cut. Aged care, in research, services, product development, etc, is blowing up big time and there's tons of services, grants and startups around that.  Mining isn't good to get in to anywhere in the country, though some places in the state are about to pick up with stuff like graphite on the Eyre etc.   Media is bad the world over.   Education can be hard to find work in but is pretty steady once you do.  I don't think SA is going to collapse overnight. There are big efforts to keep it going and improve its outlook. Even though our unemployment went up this month, there were apparently 2000 jobs added to SA in the same period. The numbers there are hard to decipher at times - are they real unemployment? What are the age brackets? What regions?  Same with employment losses. Losing a car industry is definitely bad and has roll on effects, but any industry tends to inflate its 'indirect' jobs number big time, because they use that to lobby for their interests. Mining does it, manufacturing, health, energy, any industry. Sure it's a kick in the teeth but it doesn't automatically mean you'll lose half the state's employment. The unfortunate thing at the moment is that a lot of the hardest hit areas are places where they're already doing it tough. Manufacturing jobs going screw the guys that aren't making a lot or are living in worse off areas, so those areas will be suffering.  Overall, it's not particularly better or worse. My advice is, if you're looking for a job, apply anywhere you can. Not just in SA. But if you get one in SA, I wouldn't be overall more worried that it's gonna turn Mad Max than any other state. Depending on the sector you can have very good security here. Australia's economy in general is slowing down for a whole host of reasons.  Personally there are people stocking shelves earning significantly more than me and I'm in an industry with terrible job security at the moment and pretty bad future prospects. But I enjoy my work right now and I'm really loving working in Adelaide and living in the area so I'm happy. Might not last forever but the best you can do is be prepared for that.  At least we're not Detroit."

I get a little bit of info about a lot of things, and having worked here, US, Europe, Asia, I can say that the job market in SA might seem bleak but it's nowhere near as bad as it could be. 11%+ used to be fairly normal for SA and we're doing significantly better than that now.   I just make the point that it depends on what sector because it does. Things aren't great overall, you're right, I shouldn't overstate that. But certain areas are fine. Others are boned.   I say look for a job and take it wherever you can... I left SA to get my last job before this one. And if you get a chance, do it.

I observe how the population pretty much believe or accept what gets dished up to them without resistance, but complain about a roundabout, a power line or a footpath. SA doesnt think beyond it's own borders that much. Very one-dimensional, and I find the common attitude in Adelaide about workers rights, unions, pay, wages, workloads as ideological. being competitive is second fiddle. I find the place races off to be the city that doesnt want to be like the other cities, but in the end that is hurting it a little bit. Adelaide has a class system. the Upper class/ Eastern suburbs is strangling the place, because it benefits them if things are left how they are. The state is small enough for an enclave of demographics and 'old money' to wield a ridiculous volume of sway.  a large anti-progress and NIMBY attitude. Adelaide seems to always live in the past, fear and complain about a lot of things, that is just simply everyday life in other parts of the country/world.   the future???  It's going to get ugly before it gets better. Sadly, Government money barely exists, and federal money is drying up. I actually predict SA to be the first Australian state government to go bankrupt.  Eventually, and it may take a decade it will get going again... with a lot of help, a lot of $$$ and a change in attitudes, and philosophy. The mines will eventually be opened, I predict a war is on the horizon, which will bring massive industrial boost, and after ever recession, comes growth again. Adelaide has had it's troubles before this is no different.   I dont completely blame the state government (i blame them about 70%, the eastern suburbs elite 20% and the common idiotic voters 10%), but the state government here has a lot to answer for, and I think Mike Rann could or should face charges for some of the decisions he made, that will cost the state for decades.

My two cost around $1300/year for those things or around $55/month per cat. Even a shelter will charge an adoption fee of around $150 for a cat (obviously that will vary from place to place).  Animals require stability too. There's nothing wrong with being a poor uni student or a poor uni student adopting a cat. You need to provide a stable home and trying to rent with a pet is very difficult because even though your current landlord (or whomever) may say yes, if you have to move it may be hard and that might mean taking a more expensive place that will take your pet too.

Adelaide,39fq4f,Findingcaffeine,2,Thu Jun 11 19:52:49 2015 UTC,"OK, question here: is there a reason why it needs to be a specific Russian Blue cat? If you're after aesthetics, try looking for a cat that has the same colouring but might not be a ""pure"" pedigree (ie mum, dad, grandparents, great-grandparents etc. were all Russian Blues).   If it's a temprement issue, be warned: my family's Russian Blue cat is VERY LOUD. And yes, we know he's a Russian Blue-they did get him from a breeder but they could afford it. He even managed to outmeow the Tonkinese we had (who are meant to be louder given they're part Siamese!). There are plenty of other breeds out there who are also very placid and quiet: a lot of it also has to do with how you take care of them. Those families who let their cats out at night and they wind up turning feral? They likely do not spend a lot of time with them and/or suck at caring for cats. (we let ours out during the day, but only if we're home and only in the backyard.)  Also, not to be sexist here but I would recommend getting a male. Why? Because they're easier to neuter (no stitches involved, it's more like keyhole surgery for them) and also you don't need to worry about bringing home a female cat who's pregnant without you realising it.   That said though, if you're a uni student, do your maths WELL before getting a cat. Factor in the cost of pet food: cats are notoriously picky and sometimes you may need to find 2-3 different brands before you get one that works. On that note: do NOT feed the the pet food from the meat section of the supermarket. Cat litter can get expensive if you don't bulk-buy (we went through a 15kg bag roughly every month or two). Vet visits DO get pricey and they will need their shots and desexing (there are some low cost vet clinics that will do the latter cheaper). THen there's also the toys and other things to stop it from scratching your furniture. These do add up. And also make sure that your house is catproofed."

Moved to Wellington NZ, within a couple days I had several recruiters eager to put me forward for stuff, and within a few weeks a choice of roles - companies/govt over here are WAITING for eligible folk to fill roles. Took a Senior Dev pos paying reasonably up there with Aussie wages. Just today I think our company took in another dozen or 20 dev/analyst/whatevers - lots of newbies walking around getting inducted all day. At our office in Czech they're looking for something like another 45 developers - the good jobs are out there and way under competed for, just sadly not in Radelaide."

I've never worked for a Defence contractor but I understand any job that requires a security clearance would require being a resident of Australia or another Anglosphere country continuously for at least 10 years.

Previous plans have been rejected by north adelaide council. The current plan is over some development limit so the plan goes straight to the state government for approval instead of north adelaide council. I wouldn't be surprised to see the development plan rejected again. The planned hotel is significantly taller than other buildings in the area and looks out of place. I also think the building design is ugly and lacks the addition of much needed parking spaces.

It was very exciting :)   any insight on what will go there will be greatly appreciated   Bwahahahahahahaha  Please excuse my mirth :)  Every decade a new plan is proposed.

Adelaide,394a2t,gattaaca,1 point,Tue Jun 9 08:38:50 2015 UTC,"Insurance should cover it under ""escape of liquid"" as the water is from a fixed apparatus, and the insurer can take the water company up for damages if they can prove negligence.  Providing they are insured."

Adelaide,394a2t,bassfeelsgood,2,Tue Jun 9 07:07:07 2015 UTC,How exactly do you maintain a pipe thats burried under a road?
Adelaide,394a2t,astalavista114,1 point,Tue Jun 9 09:19:52 2015 UTC,"Well, if United Water (or whoever the current contractors are) do what I expect they'll do, they'll just patch this bit of the pipe. Unfortunately, because the pipes are old, they'll have small leaks all along the pipe, and patching this one will just result in another failure further down the pipe. Instead, they need to lay a fresh pipe (using a horizontal borer and that plastic pipe [which they have been using for at least 13 years in the UK, since they were doing the same thing on my road when I lived there in 2002] - and long rolled up segments too, to minimise the joins) then they just switch over all the connections and bobs your uncle. A day or two with no water, and a month or two of irritation with the pipe laying, and the problem goes away. Unfortunately, I suspect that the ""lay new pipe"" budget comes from a different line to the ""repair the old pipe"" budget."
Adelaide,394a2t,face_towel,0,Tue Jun 9 10:25:09 2015 UTC,Routine inspections are a good place to start. Not impossible to notify people that the water main will be shutoff for X hours overnight and run an inspection camera up the inside of a long section to inspect the inside of the pipework and ascertain its condition and determine if there are any particular sections that are at risk of bursting. Unfortunately you'll probably find that in the short-medium term the cost saving of doing nothing probably outweighs what they'll spend over a year to fix burst water mains.

Adelaide,38rj72,BlueGems,2,Sat Jun 6 07:07:55 2015 UTC,"As old-fashioned as it might sound, contact your local state MP and your local council. From my understanding, food regulation is controlled by the Food Act 2001 (a state Act) and enforced by local councils so if you're really passionate about this your best bet would be to contact both.  Write to your local state MP (find their details here). Express your outrage that the Food Act only requires companies that have been found guilty by a Court to be added to a register. Tell them you want that expanded to people who have received warnings/fines/etc.   Write to your local council. If they aren't one of the ten councils trialing this new restaurant safety performance system ask them to get on board. If they are, express your approval of the system but also tell them that you want it to be mandatory for all restaurants (you could probably mention this to the MP too). Explain why increased transparency on this is so important."

Adelaide,38rj72,kombiwombi,1 point,Mon Jun 8 03:03:16 2015 UTC,"Hassle your state MP. The basic issue is the state's defamation laws.  If there's a small error, such as mixing up some photos, the Council's liability if huge. Even of there is no error the Council might run into a defamation suit -- for example the owners may have changed and a court decide the 'old' photos from last week are defaming the 'new' owners. The compensation paid by the court is out of all scale with the Council's action, and acting for a public purpose isn't a defence. Moreover although actions by the state can be protected from defamation (by tabling the report in Parliament) actions by councils are not.  What's needed is a law which forces premises to display reports and absolves councils of any liabilities dur.to the content of that report."

Adelaide,38rj72,KNuCK13_70P,2,Sun Jun 7 04:26:14 2015 UTC,"So you think it's likely that councils would hand over hundreds photographs of filthy kitchens they had what... stolen off the internet?

And you love the sensational... you wouldn't put issues in the appropriate context because you need the click bait title to get people to think you're relevant.   Your piece of shit article  didn't give any information such as perhaps it's only a small portion of restaurants? maybe the photos were from outside a restaurant not next to the bain marie as you seem to allude? maybe those restaurants have been shut down or are under new management? But hey why put things in balanced way when you could be comparing eating in Adelaide with shooting ourselves in the head (could you be any more dramatic?).

Adelaide,38rj72,prettygoodfixie,-2,Sun Jun 7 05:07:38 2015 UTC,"Without knowing where these photos actually came from, the story is nothing more than sensationalism. These photos were most likely from the few restaurants actually shut down last year. But don't let that get in the way of good story, right?  Pure sensationalism:   Just a reminder — these are restaurants operating in your suburb, serving you food.  The one with the rat’s nest could be your favourite local Italian joint. Or maybe it’s your favourite Chinese takeaway.  You’ll never know, because your council won’t tell you.   The only ""proof"" they have is the photos themselves. But without context, they are completely useless to use as evidence. This is a non-story since there is a significant lack of evidence, but Adelaidenow doesn't care; they'll just fill in the blanks like they always do."
Adelaide,38rj72,King_Yeshua,2,Sun Jun 7 04:55:05 2015 UTC,"Also - the lack of further information about what and where these restaurants are IS EXACTLY THE POINT OF THE ARTICLE. The councils are the ones finding and photographing these filthy restaurants, they're the ones who should be obliged to ""name and shame"" them on an official register so there IS context, and people know about where they're eating. That's the entire point this article is making!"
Adelaide,38rj72,peckerbrain,-1,Sun Jun 7 05:07:05 2015 UTC,"No, the point of the article is to create a sense of fear and hysteria by filling in blanks with specious speculation without having adequate evidence to support the claims being made. Journalists rely on facts that can't be proven so they can make up whatever they want to make their stories sound more exciting; they can't prove that they're right, but no one else can prove that they're wrong either. Don't worry though, it's very typical of mainstream media, so I'm sure the boss likes it."
Adelaide,38rj72,peckerbrain,0,Sun Jun 7 06:59:26 2015 UTC,"No, those photos were (as stated in the story) all of restaurants inspected by council health inspectors and issued with fines or written warnings. None of the restaurants photographed were prosecuted, therefore it's unlikely any of them were ""shut down"". They may have closed for other reasons, but that seems irrelevant. Not sure why you think photographs and documents tendered by state councils is ""a lack of evidence"" - it's the exact opposite, isn't it?"
Adelaide,38rj72,peckerbrain,0,Sun Jun 7 05:02:16 2015 UTC,'you're not wrong for long' is what they say in the newsroom there - great philosophy for keeping up your reputation.  My bet is there was just one or two rat photos but like you say why let that get in the way of a good story when you could condemn an entire industry and sell a few stories?
Adelaide,38rj72,peckerbrain,0,Sun Jun 7 05:05:25 2015 UTC,"Actually what would be a better story is if councils were obliged to name and shame restaurants with rats and roaches, as in NSW, and if restaurants had to display their food safety score on the door, like they do in New York and elsewhere in the world. Then reporting could be restricted to those restaurants doing the wrong thing. Which is exactly what this article is saying."

What about the thousands of zygotes in storage that will never see the light of day because their owners' ivf worked? Those all have the same amount of potential as what gets aborted.   Secondly, people in comas do have person hood because they have been able to previously express their views. Further to that, if it can be determined they won't wake up, we do 'abort' them."

Advertising is the private monopoly on largely public spaces and eyeballs.

Their fruits and vegetables plus medicines were largely responsible for dropping the usually massive child mortality rate for the time they were there?

Adelaide,38lwzm,autowikibot,2,Fri Jun 5 04:52:22 2015 UTC,"Southern Expressway (South Australia):       The Southern Expressway is a freeway in South Australia. It was previously the world's longest reversible one way freeway, although it has since been turned into a regular 2-direction freeway. Originally proposed as 'Noarlunga Freeway', it was built as a corridor to relieve heavy traffic from the major arterial, Main South Road, in Adelaide's south. The expressway was built in two stages — the first completed in late 1997, the second in 2001. The total cost of the arterial was A$76.5m, and it is 21 kilometres (13 mi) in total length. Main South Road provides both the start and finish. There are exits at Marion Road, Panalatinga Road, Sherriffs Road and Beach Road. The Southern Expressway is signed as M2.

Thanks  As to spiders and the size, if you are in close proximity to the CBD or in the suburbs you wont see too many. The 'huntsman spider' will be the biggest you should see.  Wikipedia says its called 'giant crab spiders because of their size and appearance'.  Worse than it sounds, in size i have never seen one bigger than maybe the length of a highlighter pen (at work, first thing i saw).  In fact, if you see them its good and you should not kill them because they eat other spiders. Thats the biggest.  In terms of types, red backs in Adelaide are poisonous, but if you are not putting your hands through sheds, under rocks etc you wont see many. Daddy long Legs are the most common you should see.  Too small to bite, skinny, small body, long legs.   In all honesty, the talk of killer spiders in AUS are CBD areas is overblown. Keep your place clean, and in newer places you will not see any to warrant any fears.  But note all this is from no research, someone might have more insight."

I've seen many people of different cultures become quite distressed at the sight of what we would call our small, harmless spiders (ie daddy long legs); it is very disabling.

Don't leave your clothes laying on the floor, you will get white tails in them. Don't walk under trees at night in the dark, there will be orb weavers hanging from them.   But seriously though as far as creepy crawlies go, you only really have to worry about red-backs and white tailed spiders in this part of the world.  Red backs are pretty passive and won't normally be seen since they love to hang out under pots in the garden shed, white tailed spiders are cheeky bastards that specialize in guerilla warfare and like dark places like the ceiling, if you leave clothes on the floor they WILL take up residency in your undies, so keep your floor clean.  Also worth mentioning huntsman spiders, they're big but don't worry, they're completely harmless and only eat other spiders. They're kind of like 8-legged geckos that like to chill out on your wall while you watch the footy. It's always good to have huntsmans in your house so don't bother them.

Adelaide,38h7qq,thatjerkharold,2,Thu Jun 4 21:19:24 2015 UTC,"I'd honestly be more worried of spiders in the US.  There are a lot here, but most aren't that bad.    Huntsmans are big and fast, so look scary, but they don't make web's and eat other spiders, cockroaches etc.  They're true spider bros. Red Backs are the most dangerous, but if you're not an infant or super old they're not a big risk.  There's never been a fatality from one without prior complications.  There's also not been a fatality since the early 80s when antivenom was developed (same for the Sydney Funnel Web, a legit dangerous spider but not one in SA). The 2 other common types are daddy long legs (make webs but are absolutely no issue) and white tips.  White tips have been rumoured to cause necrosis, but that's never been proven.    Compare that to Brown Recluse spiders in the US, who are proven to cause necrosis, and we're actually not too bad."

I'm in the inner east and other than the occasional tiny one or Daddy Long Legs (harmless) they're pretty much non-existent. In the CBD you're more likely to get attacked by the giant cockroaches, unless you like walking through the parklands at night and then you might encounter a few Orb spiders (might bite you, won't kill you, but walking into one is unpleasant) sitting in their huge webs between/under trees.   If you live around the hills or near some big reserves they'll be a bit more common, I lived off Linear Park and grew up near the foothills, Huntsmen (harmless), Whitetails (can vary from slightly sucking to being very nasty if you're allergic to them), Garden Spiders, and the odd ""Wolf Spider"" (they both suck, but aren't deadly) weren't uncommon to find around the place, not to mention the Redbacks (nasty) hiding under things that don't get moved too often.  Just get that ""outdoor"" surface spray and spray every possible entry point to your place, and keep your place tidy, and you'll be fine."

If you do that, you really shouldn't have to worry about seeing any spiders around your home. Also Daddy Long Legs spiders are good to keep, as they apparently eat or get rid of other species of spiders' eggs (I can't google it for fear of having to see pictures of actual spiders haha) But yeah, the whole ""Australia is FULL of deadly spiders"" thing is really over-hyped."

As has been said here already most spiders are innocuous. The 2 I'm personally most concerned with are the White tip spider and the redback.  The white tip is common here. They won't kill you but can have a nasty bite. The thing with these guys is that they love being indoors. They seem to love getting cosy with you, either running across your pillow or hanging out in your clothes.  The redback is very common. A lot more common in Adelaide than some people are saying here. In fact some areas of Adelaide, I'd say they are almost plague like in numbers. I could go outside right now and find a handful. These guys won't kill you unless you're fragile, but do have a nasty bite.  Statistically you probably have more chance of being killed by a coconut or a cow, so I wouldn't worry too much.

Adelaide,38ggcz,beaufingers15,1 point,Fri Jun 5 03:36:53 2015 UTC,"If you want to regularly eat a lot of sushi, I strongly recommend learning to make it yourself. Getting a sushi kit from a supermarket is only $15 or so, an ordinary rice cooker can be bought for around $15-20, then all you need is the rice ($15 for a small sack of sushi rice), seasoning (approx $10 for soy sauce, sushi rice seasoning and wasabi), extra nori sheets ($5 for a packet or two) and filling (two pieces of skinless salmon from supermarket for $15, cucumber and carrot). For less than $100, you can easily make yourself 15-20 sizeable rolls of sushi. Did this myself a couple of weeks ago and ate nothing but sushi for five straight meals."

Adelaide,38ggcz,basefield,2,Thu Jun 4 01:32:57 2015 UTC,I think Wasai is the best Japanese food in Adelaide but I wouldn't call it cheap. My baseline is Sushi Train which is always a just a bit more expensive than I want it to be.
Adelaide,38ggcz,bigvyner,1 point,Thu Jun 4 01:37:33 2015 UTC,"Sushi Train is pretty close to what I would think would be a baseline- they specialise in sushi and pretty much nothing else.

I'm not sure you will get all that much cheaper without purchasing your own raw fish and boiling your own rice, then combining the two.  I'm happy to be proved wrong however.

Adelaide,38gpyr,UnicornPenguinCat,8,Thu Jun 4 02:28:12 2015 UTC,"Rundle Street has a bunch of camping places, they sell merino clothing. Merino is really fine wool, and it's super warm, and you can get it in teeshirts, leggings and things like that. Go check that out - it's really warm and breathes. It's how my friends in the south of NZ survive winter. Bonus points for the fact that you support the Aus and NZ wool industries in the process :)  Other places outside the city: Kathmandu and Anaconda have some of that stuff. I know that there's the store on the corner of Frome/Rundle that specialises in it though."

Adelaide,38gpyr,candlesandfish,1 point,Thu Jun 4 09:26:51 2015 UTC,"Oh, that really sucks. Is it a true allergy?

Adelaide,38gpyr,candlesandfish,1 point,Thu Jun 4 12:13:07 2015 UTC,"I get really itchy unfortunately, though it might be worth seeing if it still happens with high quality wool (a quick google search suggests it might not be an actual allergy, it might just be because my skin is sensitive to coarse fibres)."
Adelaide,38gpyr,heyitsmeshaz,3,Thu Jun 4 13:02:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's why I asked :) See if you can have a feel of the really high quality stuff, there's a world of difference between superfine, well processed merino, and the itchy stuff you usually come across. There's also a world of cost, but it's worth it - I'm knitting stuff that's like baby clouds into mittens for my sister who can't stand wool in normal garments.

Adelaide,385gtg,Veganpuncher,43,Tue Jun 2 00:06:47 2015 UTC,"Hey bro,  I would not eat them. If they look common to the ones found at the store there's a good chance they're Yellow Stainers.   When I lived in the hills, my parents went picking mushrooms one day. I told them not to do it, but they did. These mushrooms looked exactly like the common field mushrooms you buy at the store.  They cooked them up the next morning while I was still asleep. I walked out to find them both vomiting their guts up with huge black rings under their eyes. I've never seen anyone look like creepy corpses before, but that was it.  They were sick for two or three days (brutal gastro, vomiting, non-stop sweating) and didn't eat mushrooms for about three years - if I ordered anything with a mushroom in it they'd start gagging.  So yeah. You can roughly tell if they're stainers a few ways - they look exactly the same from the outside, so you won't be able to tell on that count (apart from a few differences when they're very small). Break open one of them and leave it for a while. You should see part of the stalk and perhaps head start to stain a yellow colour over time (hence the name). However, even if not you should still be careful. The ring underneath the head is larger than field mushrooms typically.  Other tell tale signs are a pretty strong smell when cooking. Apparently they had a bit of a coppery taste when eating - my parents only had a few mouthfuls when the gastro kicked in.  So yeah. Be quite careful. I like the idea of mushrooming too 'cause I love the taste of the thangs, but it pays to be careful, especially with the ones that look like normal fields! If they do turn out to be yellow stainers, pop down to the store and grab some tasty, safe ones to fulfil your cravings."

Plenty of deadly ones around, and while the ones I linked are very easy to ID, you won't get a second chance if you ID wrong. There are also slippery jacks around the same places which are ediable but not as good. There are also psychoactive mushrooms, Psylocibe subaeruginosa and Amanita musceria, the latter of which can be made ediable and non-toxic by parboiling (and surprisingly tasty, very meaty in flavour, not a typical mushroom taste)."

However, if you REALLY want to eat home-grown:  Buy mushrooms from store.  When trimming mushrooms to eat, keep the trimmings.  [or harvest spores deliberately]   Dump them outside somewhere in your garden.    Remember the spot (not exactly, but, you know ""Under that tree there"", or ""by the lupins"".  When mushrooms grow from that spot, it's probably from spores in the mushroom trimmings you dumped there.    Eat and enjoy the decreased chance of gastro.  Repeat this process for years.  Any non-shop-brand mushrooms ought to be out-spored by the shop mushrooms you are constantly dumping."

All of this is contingent upon enough people emailing the management at  info@arkabahotel.com.au to declare your intent to attend upon this event at 0930 this Thursday morning. I shall be there.  The following games are on the 7th, 9th, 11th, 14th, 16th, and 18th. All at the same time (except 7th which starts at 0845.)  AS an added bonus, at the games on the 7th, 14th, and 18th, you get to see this guy: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMmIKoC3DQQ"
Adelaide,382h2x,Veganpuncher,4,Tue Jun 2 00:02:58 2015 UTC,"Update. I just got a call from the Arkaba. They've agreed to open the Sports Bar at 0930 on all Stanley Cup game days. Don't make me look like a douche. Turn up and support the Black Hawks, because Tampa Bay is in Florida, and they don't even have snow there. It's like watching Carlton and Adelaide. Sure, Adelaide's a local team, but it's basically a Frankenstein's Monster created purely to make money by lawyers and used-car salesmen; whereas Carlton has more than a century of history and tradition. Where, in Adelaide's clubrooms (wherever they are) is the memorial plaque commemorating all the players who went off to fight in the WWI or WWII? Where the photo of Jesaulenco taking that specky.  In short, come to the Ark at 0930 Thursday and cheer on the ones who look don't have sun tans and B-List model girlfriends."

Adelaide,382tlw,randomstonerfromaus,3,Mon Jun 1 13:20:20 2015 UTC,It's to keep a record as codeine can be abused. They do it for me every time I buy it.
Adelaide,382tlw,Lady_borg,1 point,Mon Jun 1 13:24:39 2015 UTC,"Oh I see, makes sense. Is it a government database thing or just a pharmacy by pharmacy basis? I tried doing some research before asking here and didn't turn anything up."
Adelaide,382tlw,Fartmatic,3,Mon Jun 1 13:31:11 2015 UTC,"With Codeine I think pharmacies are just required to keep records of it, it's different to the realtime register with Pseudoephedrine where you're on a linked database so people can't go shopping around getting as much as they want."
Adelaide,382tlw,Lady_borg,2,Mon Jun 1 13:37:38 2015 UTC,"Honestly I am not sure, I think it's just pharmacy based. I could be wrong though"

Adelaide,382tlw,YourPassportNumber,2,Mon Jun 1 13:35:20 2015 UTC,"Medicare based?? I used to buy it for a Ex, I was required to show my medicare card everytime I bought some, everytime I bought some from even a different pharmacy, it would show at which other pharmacy I bought it. So that would stop someone buying heaps of it.. Hence the abuse."

Adelaide,382tlw,Veganpuncher,1 point,Tue Jun 2 09:12:14 2015 UTC,Normally for Panafen+codein the pharmacist doesn't record details but they may if they think the customer could be abusing it. The record is internal only and there isn't a cross pharmacy registrar like there is for some other drugs. They will refuse you if they think you are ordering too much from them.
Adelaide,382tlw,Dr_SnM,1 point,Wed Jun 3 11:08:51 2015 UTC,I had a friend whose 'job' was to drive around all day from chemist to chemist and buy as much codeine and pseudoephedrine as he could . He would then drop it off at an 'associate's' house where he would be paid according to how much he had collected.  I don't think I need explain much further why chemists now ask for name and address (and ID) when you buy a highly effective analgesic/amphetamine precursor that could easily be used to synthesize illegal drugs.
Adelaide,382tlw,SwitchAUS,1 point,Thu Jun 4 01:20:16 2015 UTC,It depends where you buy it. In the city or a shitty suburb they will take your name. Go to a nice suburb they don't give a shit. I'm pretty sure it's only for that particular pharmacy's records.
Adelaide,382tlw,DerrickD26,1 point,Fri Jun 5 09:53:38 2015 UTC,"Most pharmacies don't do this yet, but some prefer to and its gaining some popularity. We know who the abusers are a good chunk of the time but a catch-all recording system is a good way of identifying less obvious problem users/people who need better pain management. There has been talk about pushing all codeine products to be recordable (similar to pseudoephedrine regulation) or S4 status to curb the issue so I would expect to see this become more commonplace."

They're a Specialized dealer so there isn't a huge range, but from what I've read around the place their bikes are rated pretty highly, particularly their Hybrids (Sirrus and Crosstrail ranges). Ended up getting the base model Sirrus and I've been pretty happy with it, I was hoping to get a Crosstrail but there was a fair wait for stock to come in at the time.  I was looking into Giant at the time too and wandered around their store for a while, they weren't very busy and no one came over to serve me so I ended up walking out."

Adelaide,381wxe,BensPixels,6,Mon Jun 1 07:10:00 2015 UTC,"I've sold heaps of cars on gumtree   Whatever you know it's worth, add $500 onto the price. I had a 97 Civic I knew had a enthusiast following and knew I could easily get or closer to 2k, I first put it up for 2000 but I would get calls offering 1500 so I jacked it to 2.5k, still got a few 1500 offers but eventually sold it a week later for $1900.   If your car is rare or you think would attract thieves, don't bring them to your house, get them to meet you at a service station so they can't come steal your car in the middle of the night. I've had a few friends with silvias and other niche cars had people come and look and then had people attempt to or steal it later in the night, I almost had it done when I was selling an e30 but I sold it the next day.   Gumtree is free to advertise and probably has the most people looking at it, I think if you're car's not worth over 10k, carsales and other pages arent really worth it, Just whack it on gumtree or on the FB FREE ADVERTISING group on facebook.  Enjoy!"

What I do, is put up one good picture, as many details as you can and your phone number and email address (make one up that you can delete afterwards if you don't like spam).  Put 'more photos available via email' etc and sit back.  I hate phone calls, as I""m hard of hearing, but for a sale, sometimes you have to. I could have sold the last car I put up there ten times over, I got so many calls and emails.  Other than that, poster at your local shops, ad in your local paper.

Adelaide,3820t6,shaftautopump,2,Mon Jun 1 08:21:52 2015 UTC,"The line speed you can get is a function of the wiring between you and the exchange. The general rule for suburbanites is the closer you are to the exchange servicing your address, the better. Then again, I've seen mates who have had longer lines than I have (by the Telstra line database) that have gotten better speeds.  Also seen country folk on extremely long runs getting good speeds (15+mbps) because of the bigger gauge wiring used.  Another thing you can do is, find the phone number of a neighbour or local business that's in the street you're looking at moving to and run that through the various ISPs tools."

The best thing you can do to improve your ADSL speed is to get a central ADSL2+ filter installed.  If you're able change ISPs, most of Ingle Farm is covered by Telstra HFC/Cable. You do pay a premium, but it's well worth it in my experience. Standard speed is 38Mbps, with an option to upgrade to 114Mbps. Plans and pricing are the same as for Telstra ADSL. You may find that this is already installed in your house for Foxtel, in which case they will just send out a modem to you."

I am 24 and have been looking for a steady job for two years. It started off with looking for work in my specialty area and now I am fighting with 16 year olds for positions at KFC and Service Stations. Pretty dismal job market at the moment.
Adelaide,380fyl,revereddesecration,12,Wed Jun 3 06:15:27 2015 UTC,"I moved here from Sydney 6 weeks ago to help out my sister who is a single mum with 3 kids and needed some help.  I thought I'd be a shoe in as I'm an experienced Manufacturing Supervisor/Retail Manager and have been gainfully employed for 20 years now without a break.  I was wrong.  The job market here is rough, and I've seen a few over the years. Most of the jobs are going through employment companies and they're a bastard to deal with. You're just a number to them.  My suggestion would be to make sure you have a few leads lined up before you move. Coming here cold was a BAD move."

Adelaide,380fyl,spuzzlord,10,Tue Jun 2 09:54:08 2015 UTC,I wouldn't recommend it. Unemployment is still rising here AFAIK. Maybe consider it when/if it starts falling.
Adelaide,380fyl,aytakk,2,Sun May 31 23:53:49 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your advice, I appreciate that."
Adelaide,380fyl,IC_Pandemonium,7,Tue Jun 2 09:55:31 2015 UTC,The job market is so garbage right now that I was just let go and struggling to even get a phone call back from bars that I apply to.  Edit: Got 2 calls literally 1 hour after for job interviews after my comment.
Adelaide,380fyl,Ginger_down_under,0,Mon Jun 1 04:29:26 2015 UTC,"Haha thanks for your advice, I was going to say I'm sorry for your situation but now I'll wish you luck!"
Adelaide,380fyl,Ginger_down_under,5,Tue Jun 2 09:44:48 2015 UTC,My wife has been looking for eight months with no luck apart from call centre temp roles. She comes across people who have been looking for 18 months with no luck. Do not move here without a job already lined up or you will be in a world of pain guaranteed. We are leaving after only 6 months for that reason
Adelaide,380fyl,insanopointless,2,Mon Jun 1 06:25:44 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your advice, I'm sorry it hasn't worked out for you. I've got plenty to thinking to do, it seems"
Adelaide,380fyl,insanopointless,5,Tue Jun 2 09:43:31 2015 UTC,Holden are closing soon which is going to add a massive amount to the unemployed here. Not sure how it effects your field as such though.
Adelaide,380fyl,bamdrew,5,Sun May 31 23:02:33 2015 UTC,"The Holden exodus is already squeezing the engineering market. Most graduate/junior positions currently have competition from people with 5+ years experience. Pretty brutal.  Retail is flying pretty well though, especially higher up positions. I have a lot of friends that have opportunities to go higher in retail, but turn them down to wait on ""a real career""."
Adelaide,380fyl,bamdrew,3,Sun May 31 23:25:11 2015 UTC,I'm in sales and training for retail (employed by distributors) and I can definitely say it's not good at the moment on my side of the fence. I can only speculate as to the product/design side of things in Adelaide but we have very few head offices here. If you have a choice and are moving for work you would be better off in Melbourne or Sydney (each have their own problems. The national job website I use is www.seek.com.au so plug in what your looking for and that should give you a indication of what's happening (note: we are heading into our end of financial year so the job market is even more depressed).  If you want to share a bit more about your specific area I might be able to give you some more information.
Adelaide,380fyl,Fenrir101,1 point,Mon Jun 1 01:59:57 2015 UTC,"Thanks very much, I appreciate your insight. I'm not looking for anything directly at the moment so I'll avoid the specifics for now. Seems like I've got plenty to think about before making my next move. Thanks again"
Adelaide,380fyl,Sproutedonthenumber9,1 point,Tue Jun 2 09:50:28 2015 UTC,"No worries, if you do come down send me a pm as its a small industry and who knows I might be of help"
Adelaide,380fyl,Sproutedonthenumber9,5,Tue Jun 2 11:09:02 2015 UTC,"Hey mate,  As others have said unemployment isn't great but it does depend what industry you're aiming for. While a lot of people from Holden will be hunting jobs it's not like you're suddenly competing with an extra few thousand because they'll be going after different stuff. Product design might be one of them - engineers and whatnot - but not on the hugest scale I'd guess.  Retail would be worth a look as there are quite a few opportunities there. There are quite a lot of retail businesses based in Adelaide. Depends what you're doing in Head Office.   Product design, take a look at a place like Hills (and Hills Innovation Centre), Seeley, etc, they're often after these kind of people.  Salary wise I can't tell you - you're on a pretty good stick for your age. You'd have to check Glassdoor or something to see the equivalent over here for your position.  My advice is, before any big move, just start looking online for work. Even if it's a year out, suss out the career pages and you'll have a better idea of what's going and what salaries are like. When you get closer, you can start applying. It's worth having a foot in ahead of time.  Websites like Seek are a decent place to start.  Good luck.  P.S. Moving for romance? I know the feelin' bro"
Adelaide,380fyl,Sproutedonthenumber9,1 point,Mon Jun 1 01:16:13 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your advice.  Romance it is, I fell in love with her, she fell in love with the city. Adelaide is just one of many possibilities looking forward but I like to do my research.  May I ask what retailers are based in Adelaide if you can recall? My area of work (without being too specific) is product based rather than HR or finance etc.   I'll definitely check out the Hills, thanks for the heads up.  Thanks again!"
Adelaide,380fyl,Sproutedonthenumber9,1 point,Tue Jun 2 09:53:47 2015 UTC,"Hey man,  I get ya. It's a tricky one for sure. I'll give you a better answer tomorrow with info on retailers when I've got some time.  It can be a roll of the dice, which isn't a great thing (at least for your sense of security) to make a life decision on for sure. What people are saying is true, generally it's not a great market. But it's not the same all the time for every position - I spent 12 months looking for a job in the US, 9 to 5 or longer every day and barely got a call back. I moved back here and got two interviews (one of which turned in to my current job) within the week - and that's in a pretty hard to get in to field.  So... yeah. You've got your head on your shoulders and sound like you'll be well prepared whatever it is. I understand though, can be real tricky to align your life with an SO when you're doing long distance. Going through that now hah.  Talk soon,"
Adelaide,380fyl,TheRamenator,2,Tue Jun 2 13:58:37 2015 UTC,"Network and try to make some contacts through people you know, promote what you would be bringing, visit and meet up with people if you can.  Job market is a bit tight at the moment, with people nervous it will get worse before it gets better.  Would recommend Sydney/Melbourne if its important to just be in the country (for family reasons?), as the job outlook over there is a bit more optimistic at the moment.   Obviously this is all just my opinion."
Adelaide,380fyl,YourPassportNumber,2,Mon Jun 1 03:41:09 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your insight, I appreciate that. If I were to move over it would be Adelaide or not at all. Sounds like a tough place to break in to and if it does happen for me I will do my best not to turn up unprepared."
Adelaide,380fyl,CherubRocker89,1 point,Tue Jun 2 09:46:38 2015 UTC,"Sure.  Adelaide is a great place, but half the conversations I have these days are about jobs.  All that being said, its definitely dependent on the job you're seeking (I have no experience with your sector).  From where you are now you can use Seek.com.au and au.Indeed.com to job hunt and dig around, and linkedin.com.au to search a little deeper.  Maybe a nice short coverletter that spells out what you're doing and when you're thinking to move would be answered by a few prospective employers?"
Adelaide,380fyl,ikarka,2,Tue Jun 2 23:55:11 2015 UTC,"I came from London two years ago, I went from having one day unemployed for my entire adult life to six months before getting my first job over here. As everyone has said the job market is brutal over here at the moment. If you can get a job before coming over its a much better place to live than anywhere I have lived in the UK (London, Milton Keynes, Oxford, Leatherhead and so on) even if it is crawling with chavs."
Adelaide,380fyl,ikarka,1 point,Tue Jun 2 04:00:27 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your advice, I appreciate that. I've visited on holiday and really enjoyed my time, definitely something to think about."

Adelaide,38162e,refinne,2,Mon Jun 1 03:07:35 2015 UTC,"I did it for a few months. I worked for one of the companies that pay hourly rather than commission-based, and it's pretty good money if you can manage the targets. If you go a few weeks not hitting targets you'll be let go, simple as that.  You need to be a people person, and okay with being rejected all day long. Foreigners tend to do better than locals too, I think people are more likely to stop for an interesting accent?   It's just as easy to get a job in retail, in my opinion, and much better job security."
Adelaide,380p67,tomssi,7,Mon Jun 1 00:09:02 2015 UTC,"The HUB. on Peel street in the city. you can get a few days pass i think.  its basically adhoc seating and offices, alot of start-up are there. kitchen, toilets, walk in and ask. from hindley walk up peel street. its about 15 metres up on the right. glass door and window with a meeting room.  Sounds perfect for what you are after."
Adelaide,380p67,Banter_Explorer,2,Mon Jun 1 02:10:17 2015 UTC,"That's a really cool idea of a place. I'm glad we have this in our city, even if I'll probably never use it."
Adelaide,380p67,KillerSeagull,7,Mon Jun 1 10:16:20 2015 UTC,"The city library in Rundle Mall is good, with free wifi: http://www.adelaidecitycouncil.com/your-community/library-services/city-library/  Depending on how intensive your work is, all Cibo cafes have free wifi courtesy of Internode. You can easily spend a few hours, if you buy a few coffees and maybe some lunch. Best option in the city for space is on Waymouth Street between King William and Light Square.  Also there's (techincally) free wifi all throughout the CBD and parts of North Adelaide, so theoretically if you find a nice place to park yourself you're good to go. I've found the network to be a bit wonky though, doesn't always work. More info here: https://hotspot.internode.on.net/partners/adelaidefree/"
Adelaide,380p67,petstarr,3,Mon Jun 1 01:10:55 2015 UTC,"Hey mate,  Internode has the CBD covered with free wifi. It can range from good-bad depending on where you are though. How good of a connection do you need? Here's a map which shows that most of the coverage is down the North end of town, as are most of the cafes and whatnot.  I would say you won't have a shortage of options. Another idea would be the City Library which is down an alley off of Rundle Mall. There's nice facilities there, it's up on a second floor and there's a balcony with some tables you can sit at.  Food courts typically have decent WiFi.  Also try the state library - even the Art Gallery or Museum should have wifi too, I would think.  Good luck."
Adelaide,380p67,insanopointless,3,Mon Jun 1 01:21:23 2015 UTC,State library is great for this.

Adelaide,37y1ea,touring123,1 point,Mon Jun 1 02:46:35 2015 UTC,"Overall, it's a personal preference. But since you asked for MY opinion, I would say 5th is far better. 4th is great if you want to run encounter after encounter and have a story of how that person who was destined for greatness was great. 5e on the other hand makes me feel different, it's more like ""Ya'know that soldier from group 3? Yeah turns out he went toe to toe with Tiamat... Barely made it out alive."" Combat is more efficient in 5th as well, you aren't playing with all of those card powers and spending a chunk of your time working out what super magical anime named attack you're going to use (I'm looking at you ""Thunder Tusk Boar Strike"")    However, my issue with 5th is that healing is a bitch. For new people, or just getting the hang of a new addition. Healing starts of at level 1 very limited if you only have one healing class in the group, it's very easy to end up surrounded by goblins and thinking ""Well that's a mighty shame, I was starting to enjoy this character. Mind you by the same token, I also enjoy that fact as it forces the group to either work together and actually fill out their roles (Tank, DPS, AoE and Heal) or start thinking seriously outside of the box.    I could go on and do an actual comparison, but I think that you got my opinion. Give it a try and see if you like it."

Adelaide,37wfi3,teh_squid,5,Sun May 31 02:00:08 2015 UTC,"I'd offer to meet up for free to test the PSU but i'm busy all of this week. I've built repaired computers for the last few years as a hobby.  If NOTHING (no PSU fan, no lights flashing or anything like that) it's probably a shot PSU.  Open up the case if you can, once done there should be near the right hand side of the Motherboard (big board in the computer) a large bulky cable around 2"" long known as the 24pin connector. remove this (press down on the connector where you can easily tell it needs it and pull away) unplug any other devices to it, usually at the top there is the CPU power connector (remove this as well the same way). and any SATA / Molex cords (these plug into your dvd drive and hdd's)  Get a paper clip or small metal wire and bend it into a U, take the 24 pin connector and locate the green wire in it (should only be one) and insert the other end of the wire into a black connector (multiple of these any are fine but the one next to the green is easy i find).  This should turn your PSU on, spinning the fan inside of it. If nothing happens reconnect the CPU and sata/molex and try once more. if still nothing your PSU is gone.  Edit: read some of your other posts, remove the GPU as well. Also i'd invest in another PSU you stated your bought a case with an inbuilt one, these are unreliable and often bronze or worse rated with horrible stand alone reviews.  Go ahead and enter your PC details into http://au.pcpartpicker.com/parts/partlist/ and either share a link of it or work it out yourself and grab a new PSU if you can afford it."

Adelaide,37wfi3,Winpro,3,Tue Jun 2 03:25:29 2015 UTC,"It is not really that hard to do it yourself. It's a bit fiddly, but it's basically not possible to connect everything so wrong that you actually damage anything because all the cables have keyed connectors so they can only fit where they're supposed to.  If you're game, you could save yourself, well I dunno $100-$150 or however much someone would charge to do it.    If you post details about your computer (is it a prebuilt system like a Dell or a HP, or did someone like a friend or a computer shop make it for you, what brand is it or where did you buy it from, how many hard drives does it have and does it have a high performance video card in it, how old is it) we could help you choose a new PSU if you want to have a go yourself."
Adelaide,37wfi3,thegeekyguy,1 point,Sun May 31 01:13:24 2015 UTC,"I did built it myself, but the case came with a PSU. I was under the impression that the PSU required a little more knowledge than the lego-style putting together of a rest of the computer, so I've always left that to MSY.   Come to think of it, I'm probably thinking more along the lines of fiddling around inside the PSU requiring some electrical engineering stuff. My knowledge of what I am doing plateaus after 'plug things in where they fit.'  So, on the back of the PSU it says it has an input voltage of 100-240 vac, if that is helpful. I've love to give you a Speccy readout but, well, that requires power, so I'll see what I can dig up.   2 Hard drives Asus Z97-A Mobo I can't find the box for the GPU right now, but it was mid-range.

Adelaide,37wfi3,thegeekyguy,6,Sun May 31 01:37:43 2015 UTC,">I did built it myself    Perfect! You already have 90% of the necessary experience then. It'll be easy. In the unlikely event you do get stuck, just Google it, or check out /r/buildapc  >but the case came with a PSU    Then it is probably a cheapie. It is possible to get a good PSU with a good case, but that comes with a high price tag. Get yourself a good PSU and you won't have to worry, and it might even be able to survive whatever killed your current one. (maybe).  >I was under the impression that the PSU required a little more knowledge than the lego-style putting together of a rest of the computer      Not really, it's more of the same. You're already most of the way there because you've already connected the mobo, HDDs and GPU so the only new thing for you is swapping the PSU over, really. It's 3-5 screws and they're in standard spots so you should be fine.    >2 Hard drives >Asus Z97-A Mobo >I can't find the box for the GPU right now, but it was mid-range    For this kind of system I would suggest about a 550-600W PSU. Your system won't use all off that, but PSUs are most efficient at about 50-70% utilisation, which helps with your power bill and heat generation. And if you get something with enough headroom, then you can always add another midrange video card and go SLI, or swap out your midrange for a single high-end card when it comes time to upgrade, without having to buy a new PSU.  Also there are different ""grades"" of PSU. You want at least ""80+ Bronze"", which means that it is at least 80% efficient at 20%, 50% and 100% load. (The more efficient, the less waste electricity and therefore heat and money).    Therefore I would suggest something like this $120 unit: http://www.pccasegear.com/index.php?main_page=product_info&amp;cPath=15_972&amp;products_id=13567 . You can get it from wherever you want, but I'll link to PCCG as they have a decent range and decent prices. You could also get a different brand, but I will only recommend brands I trust, and those are limited to Seasonic, Corsair (some of the good Corsairs are rebranded Seasonics anyway) and Antec. I am well aware that you can get a 650W name brand like Thermaltake for about $80 but like I said, I will only recommend brands I trust because I did the research to figure out which brands generate clean power, and clean power means your components last longer and are less likely to die for ""no reason"". (Admittedly that research was over two years ago so if things have changed, please correct me here).    You could try using this Corsair PSU finder tool if you want. http://www.corsair.com/en-au/psu-finder. Or have a browse around PCCaseGear's website (even if you don't actually buy from them, they just have a good site to browse). I hope I've given you enough info to get started, if you need anything else, reply again or make a post to /r/buildapc :)    OH! When you're working inside your PC, don't forget to ground yourself!    (Dammit there was something else I wanted to say but I can't remember what it is. If I think of it I'll edit this post) EDIT: Oh of course. There is a way to tell if the PSU really is fried or if it's something else. I'll reply to myself with the info."
Adelaide,37wfi3,thegeekyguy,2,Sun May 31 02:55:59 2015 UTC,"The other thing I wanted to say is there's an easy way to tell if the PSU really is fried or if it's something else. You need a hard drive or optical drive that is confirmed to work. You'll also be playing with electricity but only a couple of volts, so as long as you're not silly you should be OK (I take no responsibility for any mishaps with this method though!!).  You also need a wire, at least sorta 4cm in length, with the ends stripped. When I say wire I mean actual wire, not a cable. If you don't have wire, you can use a plain non-coloured paperclip bent into shape, but you'd need to use a bit of sandpaper or a nail file to remove about 5mm of plating at each end so that it will conduct.    Anyways what you need to do is open your PC and unplug the PSU from everything except one hard drive. You need the PSU connected to the wall and all the switches on (I mean at the wall, and some PSUs have their own switch). Now, with your hard drive or optical drive plugged in to the PSU, and the PSU unplugged from the motherboard, look at the large plug that normally goes from the PSU into the motherboard that you have just unplugged. One and only one of the wires going into that plug is green. Immediately next to that green wire is one or two black wires. Using your wire or MacGuyver'd paperclip, short out by connecting the green wire to either of the two black ones next to it, by pushing each end of your wire/paperclip into the corresponding hole on the plug. Remove your wire after 1-2 seconds; once your PSU starts with this method it keeps going, you turn it off at the wall to power everything down.  If you did this right, one of four things will happen:       Your PSU's fan turns on but the hard drive does not: This means your PSU is fried. The hard drive will start spinning if it has power. Your PSU remains silent and your hard drive does nothing: Same as #1. Your PSU remains silent but the hard drive starts spinning: This suggests that the PSU is OK, but it isn't certain because one or more of the PSU's rails might be broken while one or more others is fine. The only way to find out for sure is to try the PSU in another confirmed working system, or use a real PSU tester. Your PSU fan starts spinning, and the hard drive does too: Same as #3 but your PSU doesn't have the fancy feature where the fan doesn't spin if the load is very low.   If you used an optical drive instead, if it is working then the eject button will work and the tray will eject."

By no means does this give me any authority on the matter, but here's some things I've picked up along the way which might help your decision:   Obviously I've only attended the one uni, so I can't comment on Flinders, but what I've heard is that CS courses at Flinders are mainly practical, whereas Adelaide is a mix of practical and theory. Having the theory makes the practical stuff easier, but it can be very boring/dry at times. As /u/h0pCat said, CS is 3 years, SE is 4. As for the differences between the two: SE (at least at Adelaide uni) contains lots of maths, some electrical engineering courses, and some SE-specific courses about software design/development processes. Following on from what /u/yukimibubble said, I've seen too many people drop out of CS courses. The main reasons for this that I've seen are a) it's a little more work than they expected (ie, not just sitting in front of a computer playing/making games), and b) it's not just about game development (a reason why many people do it). That being said, i highly recommend it and I'm sure you'll enjoy it. Adelaide uni has pretty much everything, all within walking distance, but Flinders has a Subway on-campus.

Another thing that helped me make my choice initially was the fact that Adelaide's degree, at the time, was accredited by more industry organisations (Along the lines of ACM or ACS, can't remember specifics now.) Im not sure if this is still the case, but definitely something to consider.  Finally, it comes down to what you want to do. IT is very, very different to CS/SE. From mates studying at flinders, I know they do things very differently, some programming concepts that they were taught in second year, I was taught in the first month for example. At a really simple level, IT is hands on (Think managing servers, and fixing computers not booting.), CS is algorithms and programming and a lot of theory, and SE is (IMO) a cross between electronics and CS (Think like, building and programming chips, vs CS high level programming.)"

Adelaide,37s966,MythicalWizard,2,Sat May 30 04:11:03 2015 UTC,"I finished my software engineering degree at Flinders last year and am doing my CS PhD at Flinders tonsley.  I can't really comment on Adelaide quality.  The difference between the two courses is that CS is more theory based, so you look at more maths and computer theory.  SE on the other hand focuses on specific skills with a large focus on the SE process of turning requirements into software solutions. You also look at things like databases, machine learning, user interface programming etc.  There is a significant amount of crossover and Flinders provides 2 streams for SE: one for computer based (databases, algorithms) and one electronics based (you use microcontrollers and learn about signal processing and circuit design). You will also do a lot of programming, so you need to learn how to think like a programmer.  Feel free to ask me any questions you have."
Adelaide,37s966,Shinez,2,Sat May 30 03:22:31 2015 UTC,"Flinders just launched its new Tonsley campus and it is very impressive. Great atmosphere and great facilities.  There is a huge redevelopment of the main plaza area + library and other student buildings going on at the main Flinders campus which is due to be finished at the end of this year.  There is a free bus service that goes between the two campuses (which are only a 5 min drive apart anyway).  Courses at Flinders tend to be more practical based, and they pioneered the engineering industry placement program.  Internet access is unmetered for students (and they get 200Mbps on their new fibre line at Tonsley) which is definitely something to consider over Adelaide Uni."
Adelaide,37s966,h0pCat,2,Sat May 30 03:47:20 2015 UTC,"I have studied at both Adelaide Uni and Flinder's and to be honest I prefer Adelaide Uni. I found teaching staff at Adelaide more professional and course structure a lot better prepared. Flinder's, well I am not sure if its because I am doing a Masters, but I found some of the teaching methods to be a little on the lazy side to the point where one of the course coordinators stated that at a Masters level students are required to teach themselves..... (yes they said it on Flo in the course forum, I can screen shot if you want proof).   Stick to Adelaide Uni, I wish I did."
Adelaide,37s966,astalavista114,3,Sat May 30 08:36:15 2015 UTC,"Something to consider is that Software Engineering is a four year degree, and Comp Sci is three years. A Comp Sci master's is four years.   edit: From my understanding, Comp Sci will be very heavily theory based, IT will be much more practical, and Software Eng will be more of a mixture of both practical and theoretical. IT is probably the easiest and least taxing degree by a fair margin, so if you're not prepared for maths up the ass then Flinders will be the only choice as Adelaide doesn't offer an IT degree."
Adelaide,37s966,ChilliHat,2,Sat May 30 00:39:38 2015 UTC,"Adelaide has a Computer Science degree and a Maths and Computer Science Degree. The former has less compulsory maths, and the latter has more. It's mostly a legacy degree from when the two schools were combined back in the early days of computer science, for which there has never been a good reason to scrap it."
Adelaide,37s966,TurtleInATracksuit,3,Sat May 30 03:00:32 2015 UTC,"I'm first year maths student at Adelaide uni, and have to do some comp sci stuff. Honestly I think adelaide uni is the place to be; despite I go right past flinders on my way to it.   Not only is the area really what makes it. Cheap meals, drinks and going out on a friday night after a lecture, where you cross the road to go to the london is always nice.  Also, when I was considering, I thought that down the line it would be easier to find a job and appartment near the city rather than down south."
Adelaide,37s966,-IoI-,1 point,Sat May 30 07:04:16 2015 UTC,"I'm in my final year of Software Engineering at Flinders. I can only speak for my experience there.  Firstly some positives: Tonsley campus is pretty sweet, there's some cool technology in the building and teaching areas, like collaborative desks with a big monitor mounted at the end that anyone in the group can hook in to, or what's on the monitor can be shown to the class on the smartboards. The lecture theatres have massive screens, plus there's other large screens around the place. Little power stations at every seat in the theatre, as well as mics and audio output. It feels a bit like you're at the United Nations or something at first, but again this makes a difference. What people say in the lectures (aside from the lecturer themselves) can be heard on the lecture video. That kind of stuff actually makes a big difference - I wish it had been available when I started my degree. The course itself is reasonably challenging. It's probably changed a bit since I started, but what you will learn is a mix of theory and practical work, in a range of disciplines. I believe there's an electronics or computing stream (when I started there was) - with each one focussing more on the relevant areas, but also a cross-over between the 2. I chose the computing stream, but have found myself taking the electronics stream topics as electives because they're just as interesting.  A couple of negatives: I haven't found the staff to always be as responsive or helpful as what they should be, particularly when it comes to administrative matters, as opposed to academic matters. All the lecturers and tutors are pretty good, easy to talk to, easy to understand and generally know their stuff.  They are a bit slack with grading assignments within any reasonable time. For example, I've submitted 4 lab reports this semester, but haven't had any feedback as yet, so I'm really not sure how I'm tracking for this topic. I could be failing for all I know! Some of the teaching material is a bit old - while that's not always bad for some fundamentals, technology moves so fast that teaching material that's 10 years old feels dated. It's only ever minor things, like maybe a screenshot of an old UI or something like that, but even so, I think any course that has 10 year old teaching material should be reviewed and updated.  Overall, I've gained a lot of new knowledge and skills and found it to be rewarding. At the same time, I just really want it to be over - not because I'm not enjoying it or learning, but just because that grey cloud of having assignments due or exams coming up is always hanging over you.  I don't think it really matters which one you choose - it might just be location that is the deciding factor. Either way you're going to learn similar stuff. The real question you should be asking yourself is are you able to stick it out? Are you prepared to sacrifice your time to studying? Because it can be a lot of work - I don't know what level you're starting from, or how smart you are, but I consider myself pretty capable and intelligent, and even then it just takes time - lots. of. time. For me, it's worth it, but you need to consider it."

Adelaide,37s966,astalavista114,0,Sat May 30 08:27:02 2015 UTC,It is a bit hard to compare universities when I only studied at one of them.  Comp Sci at Adelaide uni was fine when I finished it back in 2004. The first year courses catered to a number of other degrees so it was quite simplistic and assumed zero knowledge. Second and third years were more focussed.
Adelaide,37s966,minnielibrarian,2,Sat May 30 01:02:39 2015 UTC,"This was shaken up about 3-4 years back. There is now an ""intro to programming course"" which is programming for people who had never done the slightest bit of coding, and then that lead into the courses that everyone else did. I believe you lose a second year elective, but don't quote me on that - check the course plan."
Adelaide,37s966,teeweehoo,0,Sat May 30 02:58:39 2015 UTC,"I can't comment on the IT program, but I can tell you that you should completely ignore Adelaide Uni's prestige and reputation. I worked there and that place is stuck in the stone age. They have no problems getting new students every year because of their popularity, so they don't put the effort into improving things like Flinders and UniSA do. Their online class management system is clunky and their library is the worst academic library in the state. If you want to change your password, you have to do it by fax or in person- not online. They put a lot of money into being showy but not a lot into their students. They have the lowest retention rates out of all of the Group of 8 universities because their lecturers put 90% of their effort into research (hence the high ratings) and only 10% of their time into teaching."

You even get an email telling you to change it a month before it expires as well. In general the available digital tools do vary, but some are amazing (like the lecture recording system).  As for lecturers, unfortunately many are indeed just researchers putting on different hats.  And this does change based on which school you are in."

Adelaide,37frx2,alfie_,5,Wed May 27 08:46:12 2015 UTC,"Adelaide Hills is spread out but incredibly charming. Shaw & Smith has a paid tasting of their wines paired with assorted cheese. If you're in a rush it'd be my one stop. Golding Wines is beautiful. Woodside Cheese Wrights are my pick for cheese in the Hills. An uninspiring cellar door to look at but the products are ace. Many specialties and seasonal experiments only available there.  Wineries of note: Barrett, Ngeringa, Golding, Deviation Road, Ashton Hills. Plenty of others I missed too. Lunch or dinner at the new Bridgewater Mill or Maximillians is great too.  Barossa is the other side of the coin. You'd think you're i. A different country vs the Hills. Cheese is from Barossa Cheese Company. They do some interesting cheese at times. If you time it with a Saturday drop In to the farmers market at Angaston. Great to see and feel the produce from Barossa and surrounding plains. Eat at Fino, FermentAsian or Hentley Farm for a treat. Wineries are numerous but don't forget about Eden Valley too.  McLaren Vale is a much underrated gem. Closer together than the Barossa, very scenic (especially the back way down from the B34 into Willunga on those dirt roads). Around the area there is Hindmarsh Valley and some other cheese makers but your easiest bet is Coriole. There range of oils, olives, wines is great. They also offer Woodside Cheese as its a semi related family business. They have a nice restaurant too. Another great place is Joseph, for a fee you can sit and taste their premiums with bread and cheese. Ensure you visit Kay's too - amazing old family winery with great fortifieds, Shiraz, and Cabernet. You may enjoy include K1 (beautiful cellar door). For food, Fino, Salopian Inn, Kitchen Door, Elbow Room. Don't forget to pop down to Port Willunga for a walk on one of the prettiest beaches in SA."

Clare - The Riesling Trail - again, camp, take bike, BYO cheese. The McLaren Vale - great wineries, but they're not kidding when they say vale, I hope you like riding up hills. Again BYO cheese.  I prefer the Barossa because they've really honed their tourism-friendly credentials. Make sure you go to Maggies Pheasant Farm, it's a bit out of the way, but worth the detour. Drive to the Tanunda Caravan Park, get an unpowered site for about $15/night, pitch a tent, set up your kit, jump on the treadly, stay on the bike/pedestrian path and you'll be golden."

We drove around rather than bike (we're not sadists). From memory it was enjoyable and introduced us to some new wineries. If you take notes it's a handy way to teach yourself how to buy and pair your own cheeses which can save a bit on future visits to the vineyards."

Adelaide,37b81h,firestorm91,2,Tue May 26 22:57:36 2015 UTC,Best advice I can give you is to use the practice test online and just keep doing it over and over and over. I think I failed 2 questions and still got through OK. Watch out if you accidentally turn the monitor off though-I did that once and they had to re-do my test.
Adelaide,37b81h,basefield,1 point,Wed May 27 02:21:36 2015 UTC,"I did it years ago but it was piss easy so I wouldn't worry. The guy didn't even check my score afterwards, he obviously thought it was all a waste of time. If you can get most the practice questions right you won't have any trouble at all on the day."

Adelaide,37b81h,Psycadet,1 point,Tue May 26 21:12:55 2015 UTC,"I did mine two months ago. When I finished the test they didn't give me a total score or where I failed, just some things to be mindful of (which I chalk up to the dodgy touchscreens). It's really as easy as everyone says in this thread.  The online practice test uses the same footage for Service SA's test, some questions in the test don't appear in the practice but they're mostly the same situations. Most of the situations where you're stationary can be answered without any input.  You'll be fine. Good luck!  http://mylicence.sa.gov.au/hazard-perception-test"
Adelaide,37bzda,ChilliHat,8,Tue May 26 14:40:45 2015 UTC,"Go to Service SA, tell them you want to get a motorcycle license. They'll give you a form and make you pay about $400 then and there. You then ring the testing place, and they book you in for 2 half day sessions, which are about 3-4 hours each. The first day involves learning how to ride and some basic manoeuvres and one the second some slightly harder ones. After that you'll do a test, which is pretty simple. If you pass you get another form to take to Service SA, and then they'll give you the learners permit."

Get your friends to chuck your CV at the HR department.  If you don't, I'd advise cold canvassing the HR departments of places with high staff turnover, like call centres. I know iinet were opening a call centre in adelaide, it might be worth checking out. Call centre work is fucking awful, but it's a job.  Inquire at places like Myer etc. Don't wait for job ads to be placed, as they get deluged with applications from the cenno crowd. Get in BEFORE the bumrush. It's a lot of legwork, thank the government for that. And for gods sake, research every company and tailor your speech and attire to suit. That's a cardinal rule, right there.  It's hell, trying to find work these days. Especially if you're young and have no real bulk to your CV.

Just add a bit of salt and water in with the koala meat and it should be fine. After canning I can boil it under pressure in the jar for a few hours and then it should be good to go. I don't mind getting the cuts out of the koala myself if you don't want to skin it yourself, but I'd want to keep some of the succulent koala meat for my troubles. PM me if you're interested."

Adelaide,36xoy4,basefield,3,Sat May 23 00:03:17 2015 UTC,They are truck keys. I have a very large very heavy piece of equipment I am supposed to deliver somewhere today. And also packing up equipment into it tonight and driving to melbourne in the morning.

Adelaide,36xlm2,jigsaw153,5,Sat May 23 03:30:56 2015 UTC,"Considering they didn't build the OST's until 2 years ago, its fully realistic that the ships were never going to be dropping in the water until around now.  I listen to the media reports about it all and am stunned how they embelish the state of the project.  There are factors unseen that have most certainly caused some delays.  Nowhere near the extent i see reported though"
Adelaide,36xlm2,calladc,0,Sat May 23 03:36:36 2015 UTC,"I know about some 'higher' delays, but still ASC have been the worst option selected to build these ships."
Adelaide,36xlm2,jigsaw153,7,Sat May 23 03:45:54 2015 UTC,Genuinely interested to hear your reasoning behind why you think that's thr case.  I don't think ASC is as much of a problem but moreso the structure of the program
Adelaide,36xlm2,calladc,2,Sat May 23 03:58:32 2015 UTC,agree to the idiotic tiered management... I need to find the articles relevent to my point.
Adelaide,36xlm2,jigsaw153,4,Sat May 23 04:13:19 2015 UTC,"I was moreso interested in your thoughts, with no media involvement.  As to why you feel the constructor is purely to blame moreso than allowing the other factors to weigh in"
Adelaide,36xlm2,calladc,0,Sat May 23 04:18:42 2015 UTC,"It was doomed from the start.   the capability to build ships here had to be built (no previous experience or expertise) higher startup costs next to building them in Victoria or Newcastle longer lead time before ship construction started compared to the other tenders I know about 14 people who work there, they tell me about the progress and sorts. Unions actually have very little to do with this project because they are (directly) locked out.   If i had to the power to choose where they were going to be built, I would have built 2 x Navantia in Spain at the same time as 2 x Built at Tenix/BAE Williamstown. They have 3 successful projects up there sleeve (with 16 ships in the last 25 yrs), offered a fast start time, and needed little startup upgrades. I wouldve exercised the 4th ship option."
Adelaide,36xlm2,jigsaw153,2,Sat May 23 04:26:47 2015 UTC,"higher startup costs next to building them in Victoria or Newcastle   What's the difference? Australian workers, no matter what state have close to the same wages."
Adelaide,36xlm2,F4rsight,1 point,Sat May 23 09:05:45 2015 UTC,"I have never ever said wages were the issue. The experienced and established builders vs. The upstart... The upstart was the poor choice, takes too long and costs too much. Navantia could've kept the F105 (same ships) production going and we would have the first two already commissioned and operational. Its ridiculous that 3 have cost the same as 6 at normal price."
Adelaide,36xlm2,jigsaw153,2,Sat May 23 09:28:51 2015 UTC,"Edit: we could've bought 7 of them if compared to how much Sweden roughly paid for their version of the design or the Spanish version. I'd say 6 at this cost if made at BAE, where the Anzac class were built"
Adelaide,36xlm2,jigsaw153,0,Sat May 23 09:42:49 2015 UTC,"I  wouldn't take their rationalizations for the delay and waste too seriously:   ""I work at asc.""  - /u/calladc   I mean, I'm sure they do a great job,  but if you work for a company that's also an institution you're going to suffer a bit of bias for pride's sake.  ASC as a whole is like Telstra as a whole - it doesn't matter how many great people work there (and in both cases, there's plenty) as long as the structure is rotten at the core."
Adelaide,36xlm2,veridikal,1 point,Sat May 23 16:19:06 2015 UTC,"I do not disagree with you, and i do not disagree with the delays.  but I do not believe the constructor is entirely at fault for the delays."

Adelaide,36uq3a,nightjesus,2,Tue May 26 03:48:14 2015 UTC,"So after looking up about the parklands, guess what I learnt years ago is wrong.  I was told, the reason why the parklands are a certain distance around all of adelaide, that was the effective shooting range cannons of 19th century had, when the fear of the Russians invading was around. So had the Russians made it into the parklands, the defenders knew the how far away they were and could use the cannons accordingly.  Anyone else heard this story?"
Adelaide,36uq3a,Koadster,4,Fri May 22 07:48:25 2015 UTC,"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adelaide_Park_Lands   Influenced by William Penn's design of Philadelphia, Light set out the city of Adelaide on a grid of one square mile, interspaced by wide boulevards and incorporating five large public squares. Light, recognising the importance of public parks, surrounded the entire city with the Adelaide Park Lands, a green-belt and the ""lungs of the city"".   I see no reason why this story needs to be made more elaborate. The city was planned that way because parklands look nice. If they wanted it for defence, they would have stripped the parklands of trees. There's also the point that no other city in Australia is designed like this, plus the fact that nobody would want to invade Adelaide anyway."
Adelaide,36uq3a,MisuVir,1 point,Fri May 22 08:02:34 2015 UTC,"Yeah I read that in Wikia after seeing this post, hence saying what I was told being wrong.. Though we did build those forts to stop russians so the fear was still there!"
Adelaide,36uq3a,Koadster,1 point,Fri May 22 08:22:21 2015 UTC,"The forts aren't to stop the Russians invading.  South Australia grew the grain which fed Britain. So an enemy of Britain could choose to destroy those ships. Finding ships in an age before radar wasn't easy. But you knew they had to leave from Port Adelaide.  So the guns in the forts were to drive off ships which were harassing the ships carrying Britain's food supply.  The guns were totally inadequate for the task. But in a sense that didn't matter, since if the threat was ever imminent then Britain could send more serious guns to mount in the forts.  That's the official line. I think there was also a law and order and ""feeling safe on the far side of the world"" justification. Without the forts any half boozed up lightly armed vessel could sail into Port Adelaide for a little R&R of the rape and pillage variety."

Adelaide,36uq3a,touring123,1 point,Sat May 23 00:10:34 2015 UTC,There is plenty of reason to believe that Fort Largs was built to defend the colony from Russia.

Adelaide,36urae,bukkaketrutles,2,Fri May 22 15:26:44 2015 UTC,"I am guessing 3x3. No furnishings. I used to have a little dog there, but a new one would have to be negotiated with strata again. I wouldn't mind though, as long as it is small, friendly and house trained. There is a doggy door and a small yard."

I'm wondering how impossible it's going to be to find a place for me and my cat without having to rent an entire HOUSE for $350 a week. :("
Adelaide,36urae,abuch47,5,Fri May 22 09:35:20 2015 UTC,"You'd be surprised. I found a great cheap place right near the city, cat allowed. We've always advertised on Gumtree for new housemates. Just check every day."

Adelaide,36q98i,frogger2504,10,Thu May 21 13:13:14 2015 UTC,Get out.
Adelaide,36q98i,Ehnto,0,Thu May 21 14:00:48 2015 UTC,You get out mate. That green one is at least on par with a FUIC. Only problem with 'em is they make me crook.
Adelaide,36q98i,frogger2504,8,Thu May 21 14:02:30 2015 UTC,So not on par with FUIC
Adelaide,36q98i,jnrdingo,2,Thu May 21 15:17:43 2015 UTC,It tastes better IMO.
Adelaide,36q98i,frogger2504,2,Thu May 21 15:19:29 2015 UTC,Sweeter and thats saying something. Cant do fuic anymore to sweet. Strong is ok but nothing beats a freshly made espresso based drink.

Adelaide,36q98i,TETZUO,2,Thu May 21 11:25:09 2015 UTC,Is that why he's stopped? I couldn't work it out.  Which part of it locks up? The bendy bit?
Adelaide,36q98i,MisuVir,3,Thu May 21 12:43:06 2015 UTC,Yeah there is a mechanism to stop the the bus getting to the point where the chassis is damaged. A mechanic can pull the pin to allow the bus to straighten up.
Adelaide,36q98i,TETZUO,3,Thu May 21 12:55:22 2015 UTC,"Exactly what happend, bus locked up in the middle of the road. Some legendary passer by got down and pulled the pin so he could move."

Adelaide,36q98i,notfinch,2,Thu May 21 22:25:26 2015 UTC,"That explains it. I rarely venture out at peak hour and thought I was seeing standard Adelaide traffic. I turned right at Greenhill but didn't see a broken down truck - but then again, I wasn't looking."

Adelaide,36m2gv,makeoutwiththatmoose,18,Wed May 20 11:34:04 2015 UTC,"West side around Leigh & Peel and beyond etc:    Ricky's Kitchen is the best in Southern Cross Arcade, bar none. Any of the chinese BBQ meats with noodles in sauce and you're laughing. Koreajung on Leigh is really good for Bibimbap. Easy to miss but tasty as heck. $14-15 bucks or so with a bunch of sides and extras so it's worth it. Ajisen does decent ramen. Ryo's on Gouger is way better but it's a bigger walk for me / no beeries as mentioned. Bread and Bone is also good for a dirty burger if you can stomach it. Mandoo on Bank St is really good. As someone mentioned, often the best way to get it is takeaway. It's a big meal though so be prepared. Sit Lo is good too, not as good as Adelaide Pho but easy and quick. I really like Mamak Corner on a cold day, their curries and roti are pretty spot on. Try a Cham / Teh Tarik for a kooky twist on coffee and tea. Around King Willo St, Dumpling King is GTs and cheap as heck. Probably better than the Gouger one. Sushi Train isn't a bad option, or old Zambrero's when I'm hungover. Heading down Victoria Square, I gotta say that I really like the Taxpayer. My favourite burger is the Al Capone and I really only bother to get that hah. As mentioned, Mamachau is good though I don't go often. If you're vegetarian check out (you probably already know it) Thea Tea House.  Up the Mall, check out United Latino Cocina or ULC. Good food and beeries on a Friday, it's down Francis St and pretty easy to miss. Around Pulteney etc, I recommend you check out Sukhumvit Soi 38. Again more suitable for a long boozie lunch I reckon, it ain't super cheap but it's the best Thai I've tried in a long while. Their seafood curry in a coconut is mind blowingly good. There's a Malaysian place in one of the arcades off of Rundle Mall that is the best I've had in town and I just can't remember it right now. Doesn't come up on Google Maps either. The walk down to Gouger / Grote / Chinatown has a bunch of stuff. I like Pitt St Korean BBQ* when I'm feeling meaty and have time. Cheap booze too. I like **Wong Kee Daily Yum Cha in the old food court - great tripe and dumplings. Mum's Kimbab in the newer food court (look, I know it's like 15 years old too but I can't remember what it's called) also has some rocking stews on a cold day. Ryo's Noodles do great ramen, closest I've had to Japan, at least for Adelaide. Pepper Lunch is another Japanese chain that's popped up and is pretty good for the price. It looks like a fast food joint but it sells beeries too. Little NNQ is a different spin on the original, but really good Vietnamese food, great for a sit down lunch. Bings as recommended to me here on Reddit has amazing dumplings. I'd buy some chilli oil from DK next door and take it to bings. Fried chicken and prawn is my hot top. There's loads more around but I waffle on about Chinatown... For food trucks, I gotta give my pals a shoutout at Low and Slow. Authentic American BBQ in the styles they run with, usually reasonably priced and quick. They haul ass to make it out every day. Vege Velo surprised me by how good it was when I first had it. Every friday on Leigh St, which kinda sucks because I usually have a sit down on Friday. Plenty of others around of course.  Most days I'll just hit a Banh Mi or cold rolls or something. My feeling on this are that cheaper are better... Banh Mi should come in a plain white bag. So I avoid Sit Lo and (the place called) Banh Mi. Personally the joint in Topham Mall is just fine for me, or the one in the tunnel that leads to the Train Station from Hindley Street. They have wasabi mayonnaise which is not at all traditional but tastes pretty feckin awesome.   That's a good start - my list for dinners on a late night work sesh completely changes though hah."
Adelaide,36m2gv,insanopointless,1 point,Thu May 21 01:31:36 2015 UTC,yeah Fresh in Station Arcade do good bahn mi and for a good price. Used to go there every day.

I've been going there for about 4 years and they've changed a bit but for most part are less stressed and friendlier.   Mum's Kimbap is probably my favourite Korean place in any food court, their Bulgogi, Spicy Chicken and Dolsot Bibimbap are super delicious."
Adelaide,36m2gv,Flippantry,2,Thu May 21 07:53:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah, think you're right. Seems much easier to get attention at King Will. Food is the same or better. Good spot in any case.  Yep. I go mad for Mum's galbitjim on a cold day. If you haven't tried it, give it a go... tender beefy bits and bones in an awesome stew... once you eat all those bits throw your rice in and soak up what's left. Not sure if that's how you're supposed to eat it, but it's awesome."

SAD Cafe does amazing sandwiches and for a markets food court laksa I go to Laksa House on Flinders St. There's an Indian place on Hindley St next to McDonalds that does a chicken tikka wrap in naan bread for real cheap which is amazing. Just a few favourites."

Adelaide,36m2gv,abuch47,1 point,Thu May 21 01:03:10 2015 UTC,Half hour or bit longer. What is bibimbap btw?
Adelaide,36m2gv,insanopointless,2,Thu May 21 01:33:49 2015 UTC,"Looks like this, basically a korean dish with meat, vegetables, an egg and chilli paste on a bunch of rice. Typically the bowl is really hot, so you mix it all up in to a big (slightly spicy) saucy mix, and the rice gets crispy from the hot bowl as you mix it. I dig it, ultimate lunch food in my mind.  Not sure if you'd have time to hoof it down there and have one, not sure how long it takes to come out but from memory it's pretty quick."

I imagine there'd be some overlap with the Heysen Trail, but there's also a bunch of lesser known tracks (Fire trails and just paths across property) that are also definitely worth checking out.  Morialta is probably the single best spot though. There tends not to be too many people there, and there's also a bunch of different tracks so you can go back and see something different each time."

Adelaide,36keml,CaffeineExperiment,3,Wed May 20 01:41:41 2015 UTC,"They still have a lot of paid staff. I would guess most of the money was spend on a shit load of overtime and operational expenditure like accommodation, fuel and food & water supplies.   In 2014 they spent $9m on aerial firefighting and most of that was for the Bangor fires so $6m isn't out of the question"

Adelaide,36keml,immrmessy,6,Wed May 20 11:43:25 2015 UTC,"Fines, levies, licenses, SA Water pricing - the new taxes propping up the state budget. Many of them act like poll taxes, falling hardest on the poor.  A normal person would be pretty worried when the volunteers themselves are questioning a series of tax hikes that are designed to support the very thing they are volunteering for."

Adelaide,36keml,inewlom,2,Wed May 20 04:04:58 2015 UTC,Can someone explain how the state got so broke all of a sudden?
Adelaide,36keml,el_polar_bear,3,Wed May 20 13:12:11 2015 UTC,A perfect storm of factors:  The GFC changed many people's behaviour from spending to paying down our credit card and housing debts. The cost of housing also finally caught up with us: if you've taken out a loan for $0.75m then that's a lot of money you are not spending. Things from China have caused a huge deflation in the cost of consumer capital goods. The increased skew of wealth has put the money from economic growth into the hands of people who don't spend it.  The result of this large drop in discretionary retail spending has been massively reduced GST collections. The result of those collections funds state governments.
Adelaide,36keml,kombiwombi,1 point,Wed May 20 13:33:47 2015 UTC,"This is all true -particularly the GFC, we were not in debt before 2007 - but only speaks to the revenue side.  The fact that we are broke also includes spending, and remember the falls in revenue from these sources have been partially offset by massive increases in fines, licensing fees and the 'ESL'.   There are a fair few ways our government shoots itself in the foot too, many of which are unmentionables for state government (here in SA or otherwise): unfunded super liabilities, backwards employment conditions, stone-aged procurement practices, automatic/stepped promotions and pay scales, large increases in politicians pay and conditions, relatively high (huge) cost of redundancy (not to mention their 'targetting' mechanism, the adverse-selection fuelled TVSP, and the infamous 'rubber room')...  Tidying up the waste would seriously help our level of debt and credit rating. But most of the solutions to these problems are political suicide, especially in South Australia where we have a relatively high number of (voting) public servants per capita."
Adelaide,36keml,TheSneak333,1 point,Thu May 21 01:34:01 2015 UTC,"Oh please, spare me the politics.  Looking at the finances the payment for superannuation is actually less than 10 and 15 years ago. As you'd expect, because of the changes to the government superannuation schemes.  The government is moving from a unfunded (ie, paid out on demand) to a fully funded (ie, paid out along with the employee's other income) scheme. But that is about containing future expenses, not current expenses. It certainly doesn't explain why we have a problem now.  You think your measures are political suicide? The areas you suggest don't make much sense. Staffing is by far and away the major cost. So you need to get rid of serious numbers of people. That means closing serious chunks of government. Close all hospitals bar Flinders, RAH and Lyell-McEwin. Condensing all metro high schools into about a dozen, and then getting rid of a fair chunk of Education House. Merge universities like we've done with TAFEs, and why are those two systems different anyway. Premier and Cabinet is half a billion dollars of pure overhead, that can go. As for new roads, forget those, it's much more efficient to run a congestion charge.  Now does the condition the state is in justify this? Not at all. But in case you are wondering what real political suicide savings would look like, there you have it."
Adelaide,36keml,kombiwombi,1 point,Thu May 21 04:40:30 2015 UTC,"The point I'm making is that there are a lot of structural issues on the spending side which also contribute to our debt levels.  I never said anything about closing hospitals (?!), merging schools or congestion charges... Actually I would be deadset against all those things.  IMO reforming the public service (which you correctly point out as the largest expense in the budget) is a great place to start, but no one will do it because it means taking on the PSU. Thats what I meant by political suicide - thousands of PS votes threatened.  But it's slowly starting to happen atm - look whats happening in SAWC for a topical example."

Adelaide,36keml,basefield,3,Wed May 20 02:09:15 2015 UTC,"Why do I have to pay for the Murray levy when I only use water from my Rain Tank?  But seriously, do you realize how quickly it goes from Surburbia to bushland? The only reason Surburbia isn't bushland is because they remove everything to make room for houses. Then you have to take into account that people are working farms further out that provides you with food. Then you can thank the Government for not cleaning out their reserves and dam lands that are out that way were as all the farms out there are pretty much cleared of any bush.  Basically its not just people CHOOSING to live in bushland. There not out there ""just cause"". Not to mention that if the fire services weren't attempting to stop this fire it could have jumped into suburbia being only about 3KM's from Tea Tree Gully and maybe 5KM from Golden Grove. Honestly those two suburbs were lucky the wind died down when it did."
Adelaide,36keml,serpentine19,2,Wed May 20 02:24:43 2015 UTC,"I was being somewhat facetious but it's an interesting conversation regardless   Why do I have to pay for the Murray levy when I only use water from my Rain Tank?   You're right, you shouldn't have to. Users should and the primary producers should pay even higher levy and pass on their costs to you as a consumer    But seriously, do you realize how quickly it goes from Surburbia to bushland?   Of course, but it's still a choice to live in high risk bushland. It's not as if urban infill is at capacity in this state.   Then you have to take into account that people are working farms further out that provides you with food.    They should wear the costs and pass them onto me as a consumer. If their farms aren't sustainable that's unfortunate but I don't see why tax payers should prop up their business.   Basically its not just people CHOOSING to live in bushland.    Mostly disagree with this sentiment.    if the fire services weren't attempting to stop this fire it could have jumped into suburbia   That was dramatically overblown. Bush fires are exactly that. Once they hit high density urban areas they run out of fuel. There is a danger to fringe-rural and peri-urban areas but they are zoned accordingly and residents well aware of the risks"
Adelaide,36keml,basefield,2,Wed May 20 02:52:26 2015 UTC,"Distributing a $6 million bill between 1.3 million people at $6 each is a lot easier then splitting it between those that were affected. It also removes the headache of people saying that they didn't ask for fire trucks to save their property or a plane to dump water on their land.  It's just a smoother process.  edit - after further reading I found out this ""levy"" isn't just to recuperate the money spent on the Sampson Flat fires, it's basically a way to apply a tax increase while hiding under the veil of good will. If you don't have 10 million budgeted from your existing ESL of $250 million, a levy that funds the fire services primarily, your budgeting sucks. I would very much like to see how much previous bush fires have cost for comparison. Journalists (or people that just know) get on it."

Just add a weighting for high and/or medium risk bushfire zones  http://i.imgur.com/0HHvizN.png"
Adelaide,36keml,basefield,2,Wed May 20 03:40:28 2015 UTC,"I get what your saying, only pay for what you use but it's just not how it works. Why, well I'm not entirely sure but I presume its because you would get nothing done otherwise. You have farmers and miners in the outback paying taxes towards things like Adelaide Oval, the new hospital, the Airport, the murray river, entertainment center and more that they may never use and you have people in the city paying for hospitals, fire services, police departments in rural areas that they may never use.  If for some reason a natural disaster wiped out the city of Adelaide (obviously an extreme scenario) would you have it that only the people living in Adelaide had to pay to have it all rebuilt? Or would you spread the bill between as many people as possible? In fact if something like that happened I imagine the Federal Government would step in and aid with country wide taxes."
Adelaide,36keml,serpentine19,1 point,Wed May 20 04:07:22 2015 UTC,"I know what you mean, but we're not talking about taxation, we're talking about a levy that is being imposed on home owners. And it's the same for people that choose to build or buy their homes in safe urban areas instead of nice leafy high-risk hills locations.  Pre-1999 the levy was collected from home insurance premiums. The insurers built a risk profile for the property and the levy amount was adjusted accordingly. That made far more sense.  The best solution now is to  split the levy into MFS and CFS service areas."
Adelaide,36keml,basefield,2,Wed May 20 04:32:52 2015 UTC,"Trust me, if the wind hadn't changed direction on Saturday morning, the fire would have burned straight down snake gully, around the Little Para Reservoir, and then straight up the hill into Greenwith, which is completely indefensible, since it in the metro zone and therefore not subject to requirements like clearing gutters of leaf litter. And no it wasn't dramatically overblown. Remember the 2003 Canberra bushfires? 4 people died and 500 homes were destroyed after those fires entered the suburbs. Imagine that, but all along from Greenwith to Burnside.  That's what would have happened if the wind hadn't turned westerly on Saturday.  Oh, and just for the record, I do live in the Hills. In a place you've probably never heard of before January."

Adelaide,36fq4c,jerry_hellloooooo,2,Tue May 19 10:29:50 2015 UTC,"Not sure if historical questions are your forte, but if the SA government held onto the land corridor rather than selling it off, do you think we'd already have something like this in the N-S Corridor?  How much work in the new project is devoted to correcting this?  How much of the MATS plan would have been realistic and come to fruition?  Just curious!  I feel like that move to sell off all the land was one of the biggest mistakes the SA government has made over the past few decades."
Adelaide,36fq4c,dexter311,2,Tue May 19 14:58:16 2015 UTC,"I believe it's been stated in the media that $1B of the $7B alone is set aside for land acquisition so obviously that would significantly reduce the cost.   What most people don't realise though is that there is significant additional costs in building the roads in brown-fields (ie. where there is already development). The need to keep traffic flowing, relocate services and work around properties adds significant delays and costs. That is part of the reason why the NEXY and SEXY were completed first, best return on investment.  I have read parts of the MATS plan years ago and yes obviously if they had held onto the land corridor it would have been a lot simplier. I believe the MATS plan had a massive junction around Ovingham/Bowden which required significant additional land acquisition and was very contentious at the time.  By scrapping the MATS plan though the Dunstan government spent money on lots of other things, festival centre for one, so who's to know how it would have played out."
Adelaide,36fq4c,jerry_hellloooooo,2,Tue May 19 22:26:42 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure Hindmarsh was gonna become the massive freeway interchange. I think the parcels of land that got acquired before the project got cancelled became Hindmarsh Stadium and the Entertainment Centre.

Presumably NorCon will have one as well, given that SEXY and NEXY have one. As for the rest of the South Road project, I'd assume that will be the same as the sections north of the Torrens."

Adelaide,36dzj3,basefield,4,Tue May 19 09:27:11 2015 UTC,Where in Northgate? I'm over in Lightsview and sure it come down just near Fosters Road. Was fucking close anyway
Adelaide,36dzj3,coconut_ice,4,Mon May 18 17:33:26 2015 UTC,"I'm in Greenacres, I saw the flash outside and thought someone was flashing their lights on high beam, then the boom. It felt like it lasted for at least a minute, the whole house shook."
Adelaide,36dzj3,Swoop666,3,Mon May 18 17:54:36 2015 UTC,I'm in Greenacres too. Woke the whole house up. I woke up on my feet thinking someone had crashed through our back fence it was so loud. Then it rumbled for about 5 minutes. Mother Nature can be awesome at times.
Adelaide,36dzj3,kfresh,2,Mon May 18 22:47:20 2015 UTC,"That would explain why the it felt like it made my heart stop for a split second, I'm about 50 meters from Fosters.  Can't say I noticed any light, though, just the deafening boom and my whole house shaking."
Adelaide,36dzj3,MisuVir,3,Mon May 18 21:29:20 2015 UTC,I'm in Holden Hill and could have sworn it hit my neighbour's house it was that loud.
Adelaide,36dzj3,kfresh,2,Tue May 19 00:05:01 2015 UTC,I honestly thought the house was collapsing when I first got woken up.
Adelaide,36dzj3,Rose94,2,Tue May 19 02:57:09 2015 UTC,"I was actually awake prior to the rumbling, I saw the flash so yes, it was probably thunder."

It was not a good way to wake up.  :("

Adelaide,36dzj3,xychromosone,2,Mon May 18 17:55:17 2015 UTC,i was awake and saw a bright flash then EXTREMELY loud thunder-claps that followed after about 3 or so seconds. The sound level peaked after a few seconds of typical rolling thunder with about two or three close together house-moving-claps. It was a single lightening strike. North east Magill area.
Adelaide,36dzj3,DemanRisu,2,Mon May 18 19:05:44 2015 UTC,Heard it in Flagstaff Hill. Goodness. I'm glad I wasn't trying to get to sleep.
Adelaide,36dzj3,mkenner,2,Mon May 18 19:40:02 2015 UTC,Just got power back here in Marden.
Adelaide,36dzj3,fatalcharm,2,Mon May 18 19:43:51 2015 UTC,"Yep, that woke me up too. I remember the house shaking a bit. I live down south, in Seacombe Gardens and surprised to hear that people from all over Adelaide heard it. I thought that it was probably thunder, but it did seem pretty strange."
Adelaide,36dzj3,MisuVir,2,Mon May 18 21:17:03 2015 UTC,"Hehe, yeah. Seemed strange to only have one lightning strike in a storm. Sounded just as loud as I imagine it sounds if my house was struck by lightning... I even looked around outside to see if I could see my neighbours house on fire.  Interested to see if they find out where it actually hit, or maybe it was just between clouds."
Adelaide,36dzj3,marknem,2,Mon May 18 21:35:48 2015 UTC,Big thunder here at Holden Hill at 2.40AM or so.  No warning either or after shocks.
Adelaide,36dzj3,MisuVir,2,Mon May 18 22:05:57 2015 UTC,Hey neighbour. My initial thought was that yet another house had exploded overnight. Happens surprisingly often around here.
Adelaide,36dzj3,marknem,2,Tue May 19 01:22:01 2015 UTC,"Haha yeah, we're not far away from that house that exploded and it woke us all up just like the thunder last night."
Adelaide,36dzj3,Arakhai,2,Tue May 19 02:50:03 2015 UTC,"I was awake and saw the flash, so knew it was thunder, but it was so long and loud, I'm not surprised people thought it was an explosion. For the thunder to go on for so long, the bolt must have been much higher altitude than usual. A quick skim of Wiki suggest it might possibly have been a positive bolt, which originates in the tops of clouds. As a result, they are much longer and more powerful than normal negatively-charged lightning bolts. They can also travel horizontally for a couple of miles before striking down, which helps explain why so much of the city could hear it."
Adelaide,36dzj3,dafunkist,2,Tue May 19 02:25:51 2015 UTC,"I'm in Windsor Gardens and I was just walking into the bathroom when the window lit up with a flash and a second later the thunder clap was that loud it made me jump.

Adelaide,36dzj3,autowikibot,1 point,Tue May 19 10:20:23 2015 UTC,"Thunder:       Thunder is the sound caused by lightning. Depending on the distance and nature of the lightning, thunder can range from a sharp, loud crack to a long, low rumble (brontide). The sudden increase in pressure and temperature from lightning produces rapid expansion of the air surrounding and within a bolt of lightning. In turn, this expansion of air creates a sonic shock wave, similar to a sonic boom, which produces the sound of thunder, often referred to as a clap, crack, or peal of thunder. The distance of the lightning can be calculated by the listener based on the time interval from when the lightning is seen to when the sound is heard.

Most courses will allow you in if you just sit a STAT test. But if your course has prerequisites, you will need to do bridging courses and then a STAT test. The Uni that you want to enrol at will help you with the best course of action if you need prerequisites.  TAFE is also a good pathway to Uni, as it has a much lower entry requirement and you can use TAFE certificates to help with Uni prerequisites. Going to TAFE can also shorten your Uni degree as long as the subject is the same."

I fucked up year 12 badly, and I decided to do the STAT test to get into Adelaide uni - I did okay. I got =/> 75% of people who sat it, so I could get into an Arts degree. I bombed out hard because I was a shitty student who insisted on taking the easy way out (or in), finding the loopholes, not putting in the hard work.  So I bombed, got a 2.2 GPA, got majorly depressed. Decided to get my life in order, went to adult re-entry college to repeat years 11 and 12, I studied full time there. Took on specialist maths, maths studies, chemistry, physics and biology. Coming in as an adult was amazing.  I stuck through the two years, all the better for the added maturity and safe in the knowledge that I wasn't doing this because I had to, but because I wanted to. I smashed year 12 with a 96.2 ATAR, and got accepted into a bachelor of Aerospace Engineering, which I decided against going into because I wasn't interested in the maths. So now I'm three years into an equally amazing and challenging degree. The relationships I make are more profound as an adult, I've had oodles of work opportunities because I demonstrated courage in returning to school.  Better than anything else, one of my friends went to Marden as well, and he became a pilot for the air force - and he only got Cs and Bs in: maths studies, physics, chemistry and english.  Don't be an asshole and take the easy way out, everyone will see that you're just lazy. Do right by yourself and do the hard thing. The military doesn't want lazy assholes."
Adelaide,364wzd,CyberDoakes,3,Sat May 16 14:36:29 2015 UTC,"My experience is similar to yours. Did shit all in school, failed everything, and came back after 20 to try again. I went to Thebarton for my re-entry, and I found it pretty damn good. The large majority of the school are international students, so because of this it's considered a ""disadvantaged"" school because most of the students only have poor English. So you get like 6 bonus points on your ATAR at the end, just because it's filled with fobs.   To answer OPs questions: yes, I did it full time. There was a pretty wide variety of subjects, pretty much anything you'd expect to find at a high school (they even teach Persian). As for payment, centrelink covered that for me, but that might depend on your circumstances."

Adelaide,364wzd,BlueGems,1 point,Sat May 16 06:52:04 2015 UTC,"I did it at a normal pace, I'm not sure if you can accelerate it. You might be able to go straight to year 12 depending on background knowledge, but if you don't have a background in science then I would recommend starting at year 11 to get the foundations. The way it works now is you do 4 subjects and an independent research project on whatever you want. I dont think you'll find a subject purely on geometry, it would be a topic in a more general course."

Adelaide,364wzd,firestorm91,1 point,Sat May 16 06:55:11 2015 UTC,"You've already done half of year 11, and specialist maths only takes up one semester. You could conceivably do second semester chemistry, spec., english, and physics (you only need to do four subjects with new SACE).  Physics isn't tricky, year 11 is a bit of a waste of time. If you feel like you have a good understanding of it you could just do second semester this year (so you can get spec. and english requirements), and then go into year 12 next year. It will only take you a year and a half from now instead of two and a half years.  But yeah, it takes a year to graduate. You need to do all of the coursework in the lead up to exams in year 12. Year 11 isn't difficult in any regard, but you should have enforce good study habits on yourself, because no matter what age you are year 12 is a fucking trial."

Adelaide,364wzd,eifos,1 point,Sun May 17 00:29:55 2015 UTC,"You travel 60km/h for 30 minutes. What's your total displacement (distance)?  Distance (s) = velocity (v) multiplied by time (t). (s = v.t)  Convert minutes to hours so the units match up.  30/60 = 0.5 hours.  Sub into original equation:   s = 60 x 0.5  s = 30km.  Did you follow that? You can now do year 11 physics. Do you know how to do algebra? What if, for instance, you want to find out the mass (m) of an object, and you know its momentum and velocity?  Well, momentum (p) = mass x velocity.  So the equation looks like this:  Note: (Newtons are the units in this case, like seconds, or metres.)  500 Newtons = m x 15 metres/second  You use algebra to make mass (m) the subject. So you want to get rid of the 15 m/s, so you divide the right hand side by 15. Anything you do to the right hand side you do to the left hand side (this will become second nature to you very quickly).  500/15 = m  m = 33.33 kg  If you understand and follow all of that then any of the new concepts in physics you'll learn about (electricity, magnetism, radiation, universal gravitation, collisions, kinematics) will follow a similar vein, just the formulas get longer and the concepts a bit trickier in some cases.  Make no mistake, if you want to impress the military you'll want to do physics and maths. English helps you study at any Australian university. The other subject is up to you, but chemistry won't help you be a pilot. If you're really committed to this you should be passionate about what you're studying."

Chemistry was my favorite subject at one point. I have an interest in it and it is listed on the education requirements page, though not mandatory.  Albegra was probably one of the easiest subjects I did in maths, but it's not like they went into Advanced Algebra. I'd probably need a 30 minute refresher to an hour at most, which can be done via available web resources.  I've looked at Thebarton subjects and I'd most likely do Mathematical Studies A, B & C, as the Maths Applications unit I passed originally is not accepted.

Adelaide,35y6fp,KNuCK13_70P,2,Thu May 14 23:44:43 2015 UTC,"I agree. For example, UniSA is MUCH better for journalism, and boasts impressive alumni such as Sally Sara and many top notch journos.   Edit: also Adelaide is a fantastic city and cost of living is downright incredible for what you get compared to many other capital cities."

Adelaide,35y6fp,shakaspeare,3,Fri May 15 10:25:07 2015 UTC,"I'm studying a Bachelor of Media at Adelaide as a mature age student... It's ok. I'm majoring in Photography which I haven't started yet but apparently the program is now a lot better for that practical type of work (will be doing one full day a week at TTG TAFE campus working in studio, etc).  The reason I chose the Media degree instead of a VA degree is so I had more choices in terms of career prospects - I'm a photographer but I'm realistic about that being a long term thing.  It's a varied degree and can be boring at times, it would really depend on what your friend is interested in pursuing afterwards.  The campus is fairly easy to navigate, you have access to everything, although I try not to spend time on campus because I work better at home.   So far so good to me, I've been there a year."
Adelaide,35y6fp,cntdlxe,2,Fri May 15 01:21:38 2015 UTC,Thank you to everyone that gave some feedback. It's all appreciated!
Adelaide,35y6fp,InexplicableRage,1 point,Fri May 15 10:39:58 2015 UTC,"For Business your best bet would be Adelaide, although going off hydr0xides comments, it is generally not recognised for its industry learning during your degree. Generally it doesn't matter for many Adelaide students as they already have extensive family/friend professional networks but if you aren't from here it can be a pain."
Adelaide,35y6fp,hydr0xide,1 point,Fri May 15 00:28:15 2015 UTC,"Which university is she looking at in Melb?  I wrote the below about UoA in response to a similar question (specific to the Bachelor of Laws) a few months back, maybe it helps.  I got my LLB from University of Adelaide (graduated quite a few years ago so things may have changed).  The good:   good central location mostly good lecturers course structure and choice of electives is pretty good marking standards were generally high (so if someone received a distinction/high distinction, they earned it). assuming they still do them, 3 hour exams (which tends to separate the men from the boys) good library Adelaide is a cheaper place to live than Sydney/Melbourne/Brisbane attractive girls   The bad   low contact hours still very ""academically"" focused and (IMO) not enough practical/mock instruction. I didn't read a single contract until I started work in a law firm. I think I would have been more motivated (and got more out of it) if we were dealing with actual issues more often. I hear the honours system has been destroyed so there's no way to stand out from the crowd. students are mostly Adelaide born and bred with few exchange/interstate students so there's a bit of a herd mentality high school entry standards are high but after that, it drops a bit - so you get quite a few people who are only there to scrape through. You might be disappointed if you're looking for a challenging environment. doesn't have the name recognition of UNSW or Melbourne which makes it more difficult to get jobs in those cities (though if you go back to Canada it's probably a moot point). Adelaide is a smaller city than the others so you really have to make the effort to form a network   Basically I had an absolute blast at Adelaide and I'd have no problem sending my kids there (or even going back there myself), but equally I recognise that there are probably more rigorous/practical universities out there in more ""lively"" cities."

Adelaide,35y6fp,hydr0xide,1 point,Fri May 15 04:43:23 2015 UTC,I graduated from Adelaide Uni under 3 years ago. A few points - Adelaide still have 3 hour exams and the honors systems hasn't been destroyed.

I think it is rather nice that the young people are very accepting today, although, maybe I drop into the elderly rather than the middle age group.

Adelaide,35vwom,Veganpuncher,-49,Thu May 14 03:24:20 2015 UTC,Middle-aged people shouldn't dance. Dignity is a very important asset. Don't throw it away.

Adelaide,35xk1p,AUGN,7,Thu May 14 10:25:14 2015 UTC,"City Gym in Light Square. I've brought this up so many times. They're cheap, the facilities are first class, the staff are the most friendly and helpful I've ever experienced, they have a broad range of martial arts, dance, aerobics etc classes for all skill levels and times, the music is only mildly cheesy, the other customers are all completely cool - no roid-heads or posers, they go out of their way to help. The showers are clean, they have a cool lunch/chill out room, they don't bullshit about supplements, and they have all the machines/weights/kettles/bells/whistles you could ask for.  Their number one policy is inclusiveness. Don't be a dick and you'll be treated like gold. I know there is some homophobia out there so let's be adults. It's a gay gym, but they don't give a fuck about your sexuality, just be cool and don't worry about the Rick Astley music. You may even get invites to the best parties in town.  Ironically, they're right next door to the biggest roid-monster, pissing-contest gym in town: Gold's (I think. It used to be Church Nightclub until it got closed down for being terrible). Mirrors everywhere, nothing but beach-muscles, full of bikies and wannabes.  TL:DR City Gym."
Adelaide,35xk1p,Veganpuncher,1 point,Thu May 14 21:55:20 2015 UTC,+1 for City Gym
Adelaide,35xk1p,hydr0xide,3,Thu May 14 23:42:57 2015 UTC,"It's frequented by the gay community because it isn't full of wankers who think gay=weak. There are plenty of straight people there, too. But it just openly says that it welcomes gay people and won't tolerate prejudice. It's ironic that its Muay Thai team regularly beat the shit out of clubs full of bikies and roid-monsters. It's not gay per se, it just doesn't give a shit if you are. If you're worried about saunas and shit, don't be. The closest thing to a sauna is the fully-equipped boxing ring.  I love the place because there are no posers, no wankers, no roid-monsters. Just people who want to work out in peace and be surrounded by cool people who share their passion for fitness. There are plenty of beginners, everyone helps each other out. It doesn't matter if you're old or young, fat or skinny, or whatever, everyone behaves nicely toward one another. It's cheap, friendly and well-equipped. They don't try to sell you stuff. And it's in the middle of town. What more do you want?  As I said, I don't have a financial interest in the place, I'm just happy that I found it. It's such a nice change from the chains that try to sell you stuff, and the parochial gyms full of dickheads who all look like they want to fight you all the time."
