orangecounty,3e4mo5,Nugur,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:56:50 2015 UTC,I have an 8 year old corgi. He's a bit too old for your girl though. Hope you find someone!
orangecounty,3e4mo5,Battle-Corgi,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:17:07 2015 UTC,"I have a two year old boy corgi who is submissive and super friendly! I always take him into the large or small dog parks, whichever feels best. She isn't too big for the small side, I assure you. She's just a teenager and full of energy, so she's too much for mature dogs.   That being said, regular trips and keeping her in the small side will help her learn doggie manners and appropriate social skills. I live near the Huntington Dog Park and feel it has a better space for small dogs. I'm thinking you might go to the one off the 55 and tustin? Their small dog area is awful.   If you want to meet regularly at the Huntington Dog Park, I would love to set something up! Let me know :)"

orangecounty,3e3kea,findea,2,Tue Jul 21 18:10:13 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind there were no signs of trauma found (on the decomposing body) and I've heard the toxicology came back inconclusive. The events of the night were that she left the club, went to her boyfriend's townhouse, they eventually got in an argument and she left in the middle of the night. Her car was found weeks later parked less than a mile from her parent's house.   Who did she call that night? Seems to me someone picked her up. Who was it? If the ex-boyfriend hasn't been arrested and isn't considered a suspect, it MAY have been someone else. Keep in mind that he had a restraining order out on her. Not the other way around. Did she OD on something and die? Maybe this mystery person she was with panicked and dumped the body.  These parents even in their grieving need to be honest in the fact their daughter had problems. It may have just been a drinking problem, but it certainly could've been more. I think if she were murdered, there would be some sign of it in an autopsy."

I made a lot of friends when I started doing classes at my gym. I know it sounds simple but I would start there."
orangecounty,3e2iz1,colormegold,2,Tue Jul 21 19:13:03 2015 UTC,"That's funny. I'm from NJ and I spent a couple years in Vegas and a little over a year in CA. It wasn't bad, but I really missed the east coast. I ended up moving back to NJ last year to spend time with family and go back to school, but my bf still lives there (in RSM. Also, I'm still considering moving back after I graduate). We have never visited Orange, but maybe I will the next time I visit him (or if I move back, but I'd really love for him to come out here).  What about Orange does your bf find is similar to out here? Do you or your bf have any recommendations for places to go or things to do?  Edit: Just realized I didn't finish typing a sentence before submitting, so fixed that."
orangecounty,3e2iz1,J_cob_of_corn,2,Tue Jul 21 20:31:43 2015 UTC,"I think the overall style of the brick buildings, how you can easily bar hop by walking from one place to another (unlike some areas of OC/LA a California block is different than a NYC/NJ block). Another area you should venture out to is Pasadena. He lived there for quite some time and also enjoyed the culture, community, and sense of east coast vibe in the architecture and bars. Our favorite restaurant in Orange was Felix's (Cuban food), Filling Station for breakfast, and Rutabegorz. I have lived in California my whole life and lived in LA, OC, and the Inland Empire. My favorite cities have always been Long Beach (where we currently live), Orange, Pasadena, and Claremont. Have fun exploring outside of OC too hope you get to check out some of the other cities besides LA.  We like going to wine bars, restaurants, and lounges. Not sure if that is your scene but let me know what you are looking for and I can make some suggestions."

You have The Observatory/The Constellation Room over in Santa Ana which is a bigger venue that gets tons of awesome acts through. Downtown Fullerton has the Slide Bar and The Continental Room. If you're down to go a bit farther there is a ton of super rad venues over in LA as well. Welcome to Orange County, a lot of the people here are pretty awesome!"

Just walk around Downtown Costa Mesa or Downtown Fullerton on a Friday night and you'll easily find the bars with music. If you want something classier, go to Fashion Island in Newport Beach or Irvine Spectrum.  What brought you and your girlfriend to the OC?

Men's league still has to touch the plate.   I do remember it being a great league though. I should get back into it. Thanks for reminding me OP.

orangecounty,3e3vhi,Measure2xCutOnce,5,Tue Jul 21 19:25:34 2015 UTC,"Home Depot sells ant bait that the ants take back to the nest, and kills the queen, which kills the colony. This is what I use, and it usually works far better than trying to ant-proof the entire house or just spraying them. It's less that $10 for enough to leave a perimeter around a normal sized home."
orangecounty,3e3vhi,socalchris,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:27:22 2015 UTC,Awesome. Thanks. I live in a 2 br apartment so I guess it should be more than enough.
orangecounty,3e3vhi,crusader561,2,Tue Jul 21 19:51:21 2015 UTC,I fought ants for a decade.  The Terro bait in liquid form worked the best.  The ants dig that stuff.  But the ants always came back.  Finally called Terminex.  Haven't had a problem since.
orangecounty,3e3vhi,nonironiccomment,2,Tue Jul 21 20:38:21 2015 UTC,How much does terminex cost and what do they do just spray one time?
orangecounty,3e3vhi,crusader561,2,Tue Jul 21 21:17:29 2015 UTC,"I think you can do a one time visit or sign up for varying amounts of visits per year.  I think I have a quarterly visit.  I don't remember the rates..I think its $20 or $30 per visit.  The spray is supposedly OK for pets.  I take that with a grain of salt and keep the dogs away from freshly sprayed areas until it dries out.  Of course they'll take care of rats, mice, crickets, etc.  FYI, I do not work for Terminex or own stock :-)"
orangecounty,3e3vhi,beeplogic,2,Tue Jul 21 23:49:51 2015 UTC,"We've had ant issues during the summer for a few years but earlier this year it got unbearable. I ended up getting a recommendation from a termite guy (who used to do pest control). We did end up having subterranean termites but they were primarily outside the house. He said that some pest control companies just want to hook home owners on monthly services to get a recurring service going.   He recommended an termiticide called ""termidor sc"", its highly concentrated so I ended up with way more than I needed. It's a ""slow kill"" process so you need to be able to essentially spray the ants and where they're going. I was able to spray my house with one gallon worth of mixture. The ants did not die immediately upon spraying but were annoyed they were wet. The next day there was a number of dead ants oustide our house but by day 2 and 3 there were TONS of dead ants outside. After a week or two of no ants they did end up finding one way back into the house, from underneath the baseboard. It was a small area that I lightly sprayed with the tiny bit of the left overs from the initial gallon. We've been ant free inside the house since then (this was back in March) thankfully!"

I went to high school with her and her art is fantastic.  You can buy a custom caricature through Etsy (convo her directly if you are looking at a series of them, otherwise it'll be spendy).  I've also seen caricature proposals at Disneyland-- you have the artist draw a caricature of you two, with you proposing, so when she sees the big reveal, that's when you do it.  The artist will put up a sign on the sketch warning passersby to keep quiet about the surprise."

orangecounty,3dzrca,Office_Zombie,24,Mon Jul 20 21:13:42 2015 UTC,"So she deleted the number she called? I'm sure the police department has gotten ahold of that number. Where did that lead? What did the text the next day say?   Most 16 year olds don't know what type of person they are, so to say she's not the type of person to run away or not to text/call is just wishful thinking trying to deny possibility she ran away."
orangecounty,3dzrca,EllenPaoFan,7,Mon Jul 20 21:29:06 2015 UTC,"Nope; as of yesterday I understand the PD hasn't even talked to the kid who's phone she used. Police department hasn't done much more than tell the family to sit and spin because the cop in charge is on vacation and no one else can access his files. My sister went with the mother yesterday to try to get them motivated and they were told to piss off. (In a much more PC way of course.)   A few days ago, I was thinking runaway. but there has been nothing but silence. No contact with family, friends, anyone. Just one text to the sister saying she was fine last Tuesday.   I'm starting to think this is going to end up on ID Discovery, but I hope I'm wrong."
orangecounty,3dzrca,EllenPaoFan,12,Mon Jul 20 21:50:03 2015 UTC,"This screams runaway to me. You need to find some way to get in contact with the owner of the cell phone she used, then have them get the phone number she dialed from the phone company. From there you'll be able to tell who she called and potentially find her in a matter of hours.  From what you describe the police obviously believe this is a runaway and not a kidnapping. Police love cases of kidnapping (where they find the victim) because it gets them notoriety, so it doesn't make sense for the police to drag their feet unless they don't believe there was any foul play."
orangecounty,3dzrca,knocklessmonster,6,Tue Jul 21 01:55:55 2015 UTC,"If you want to get help, try going to the media, that should get the PD's ass in gear.  It might hurt the chances of finding her, but maybe plastering her face on the news stations will help, if that's possible.  I'm sure they'd eat up a story about cops not helping find a missing teen."
orangecounty,3dzrca,mabahoangpuetmo,3,Mon Jul 20 23:57:23 2015 UTC,"Police in general are more or less apathetic in this type of situation, unless it was an obviously forced kidnapping (something along the lines of eyewitness or cctv footage of the person being forcefully abducted). Runaway teens are a dime a dozen. The GREAT majority of the time the situation resolves itself with the teen getting homesick or running out of money, resulting in them returning home on their own.   If the girl called the person who picked her up and deleted the number, this highly suggests she was a willing participant.   The police simply can't investigate every single missing child (teen) report.  National Runaway Safeline statistics show that 51 percent return before 1 week. 17 percent up to four weeks and the rest even more.   I know when I was a younger, I covered for one of my friends. Being a loyal friend, I would not reveal knowing where he was. That being said, it is possible one of her friends may actually know something or may even be in contact with her.   If I were the parents of the missing teen I would reach out to their friends. Do not pry them too much for information on a location (maybe just ask when is the last they heard from them), but just let their friend's know face to face how concerend I am. If their friend's are anything like I was at that age, you're not going to get much information out of them anyways. If the friend has a way to contact them they may forward the message (once you've left) and possibly sway the runaway's mind to either return home or at the very least make contact to show that they are okay.   P.S. sorry for the thesis"
orangecounty,3dzrca,Dinosaurgasm,5,Tue Jul 21 01:52:25 2015 UTC,"I knew a 16 year old who did the same thing, absolutely no contact, and VERY unlike her to not be all over social media. Turns out, she was visiting her bf in another state and turned her phone off cause she didn't want to be found and get in trouble. Hopefully it's some dumb act like this and nothing more serious.."

They can access the call and text logs and see the exact number she called and anyone else she's been in contact with since she left. My brother pulled this shit too- ran away in the middle of the night and only sent us one ""i'm OK"" message. We tracked him down via the cell records. It's a start at least. I hope you get your answers."
orangecounty,3dzrca,aknite,10,Tue Jul 21 20:54:29 2015 UTC,Right... She deleted the number... She's actively trying to hide something. I did stupid stuff when I was 16 too.   I'll keep am eye out for her and hope we find out she is ok. I am sure she just did something without thinking it through and OP will hear from her soon.
orangecounty,3dzrca,fgben,12,Mon Jul 20 21:38:02 2015 UTC,"If you can reach the kid whose phone she used, it doesn't matter that she deleted the number.  The phone company has a record of that and could provide it in minutes if the police or account holder asked them for it."

Maybe not on the same side of the 5 but with rent prices so crazy it's very smart to ""get in"" the market any way you can.  Maybe sacrifice what area you live in until you build up some equity and in the future you will have more buying power and can move up.  Do you have an agent helping you?"

I doubt they are going to advertise a picture of a newer generation camero and give you some piece of shit one from the 80s. They won't do shit like that. Maybe some back corner rental company nobody has heard their name, run by some guy missing teeth.

I used to live down the ways from there, actually the last house at the end of Santiago where there is a pedestrian bridge over this same ""river"" or ""creek"", acutally 1/2 mile downriver from where this was filmed. Anyways, 1992-1994 while living there,  when rain was a regular thing, this ""creek"" would be a raging river. Living in Santa Ana and waking up to the sound of a rushing river was pretty cool thinking back on it.   The water height in this video was nothing compared to when its been raining for weeks."

It is $800/mo including utilities, shared bathroom, street parking, and private room in a townhome living with 2 other dudes. Not the cheapest, but the area is nice, house is clean, and roommates have similar lifestyles.   I found it on craigslist after about a week of searching and about 15 ads replied to. Maybe got 3 replies total from the poster. My advice is to use the shotgun approach - make a template email and send it out to all the ads that meet your criteria, then weed out the scams. I saw most ads in the range of 600-800 for a private room, so not too bad. Single appartment prices are ridiculous though."

The second time, I rented a room in a townhouse in Tustin with my SO. We had the master + bathroom + 1 parking spot for $950 between the two of us.  I think it's definitely do-able to find something in the $500-$800 range for your own bedroom and bathroom, but you should be open to sharing a bathroom and/or having shared space utilized differently."

They're gonna lord it over you and will always pull the whole ""it's my house"" nonsense and forget you are giving them hundreds of dollars a month. The 1st person I moved in with gave me crap about ""heavy cooking"", drinking and overnight guests. You don't want to pay $500 a month to put up with that bullshit.  Other tips.  If you smoke weed you should search online for ""420 friendly"" etc as you don't want to live with some uptight assholes. Make sure that when you visit it's not too clean either if you're not a clean person. They're gonna expect you to be that clean too and will pitch little hissy fits if you start leaving dirty dishes around or  start doing hot knives in the kitchen.

IDK if you're doing the J1 visa or simply coming as tourists, though. Anyhow, I can't speak for Long Beach, but we definitely have a lot of Irish kids here in OC during the summer. They always seem to enjoy Huntington Beach or Costa Mesa because it's close to the beach, bars, and clubs. I've never heard of them getting a hostel since the people I've met always rent apartments and cram about 15 people into a 2-bedroom apartment. And yes our public transport is really bad. Our coastal areas have more wealthy people who own cars so there's even less public transport available there. It's so bad that a lot of the Irish kids I've met rent/buy bikes because it's quicker than waiting for the bus."

orangecounty,3dkehe,ifallalot,6,Fri Jul 17 11:40:53 2015 UTC,"Long Beach is a solid choice with loads of bars.  It is in Los Angeles County, but since you only mention Orange County I assume you intend to be hanging out mostly around there and further south?  If so, Huntington Beach and Newport Beach are common OC destinations for beaches and bars, and between the two I'd say Huntington is definitely better suited for your purposes -- more chill and youthful atmosphere.  And if you are going to be here toward the end of July, that's when the US Open of Surfing in Huntington occurs, which is a basically just an excuse to have a massive beach party (never heard of anyone going to actually watch the competition) so it's a great tourist attraction.  Newport Beach is a very wealthy area, and that vibe was too apparent in my opinion as I felt out of place at the bars there and found them pretty boring.  If you head to inland Orange County at all Downtown Fullerton definitely has the best nightlife -- lots of bars and food but also lots of college students, so lines galore.   If you do get up further up the coast into Los Angeles County I would recommend the Redondo/Hermosa Beach bars.  Out of all the places I've mentioned, I had the most fun there.  My favorite beach is Laguna, as in for the actual waters and rocks and such, and I've been there the most but never went to a dedicated bar or club there; I'm not even sure they have them -- also a very affluent area so they all seem to be just restaurant/bar situations.  It's a nice place to walk around for ice cream, shops, food, etc though.  As mentioned, public transit is indeed a joke in Southern California so Uber or Lyft are your best bets.  I have never seen or heard of any hostel in Orange County, so I can't help you with that either. :-/"

No, it won't be what you're used to, almost all out busses run I  straight lines and trains in orange county are for leaving the county, not traveling around it. Bus schedules are regular if slow. It's going to take you an hour to get anywhere. Busses do stop running and for nightlife they stop running too early. So you'll need a cab (or an uber) if you're trying to get around after ten at night.   But since you're here for the summer fucking off anyway, getting around by bus before 10 pm is just fine, if a little slow."

Half my friends get sick every time after eating there, and I had one friend that used to work there and he/she verified their ill practices. It's also rated lowly on Yelp with reports of Salmonella (doesn't surprise me). The other one is located inside the food court at H-Mart and it's called Love Letter, which is a substantial improvement over BBQ chicken.

orangecounty,3df6kq,UnluckyPenguin,-3,Wed Jul 15 22:35:50 2015 UTC,"You've probably never heard of the Basic Speed Law (Veh. Code, § 22350)   A person must drive at a reasonable speed. Whether a particular speed is reasonable depends on the circumstances such as traffic, weather, visibility, and road conditions. Drivers must not drive so fast that they create a danger to people or property.   So basically the speed limit doesn't mean anything if everyone else can drive safely above the speed limit, so you should still pull over.   The only exceptions are 25MPH residential and 65 or 70MPH freeways.   *edit: Please see my comment here. Feel free not to believe me and pay your 400$ speeding tickets while I get out of mine."
orangecounty,3df6kq,SpanishBee,2,Thu Jul 16 16:38:54 2015 UTC,So when I get a speeding ticket I just tell the officer that I was driving safe and then I'm good? I don't think that's how it works.

I've gotten a dozen tickets, my other family members have gotten 2 dozen tickets, all for driving safely above the speed limit. And we got out of the tickets by pointing out the basic speed law.  It is seriously common sense, that is why california cops normally only pull people over when they are at least 15mph over the speed limit."

As I said in another comment, Basic speed law is meant to keep people going under the speed limit in unsafe conditions. For example if it is super foggy out and there is 10 foot visibility and you are going 50 in a 60 mph zone, you can be pulled over for speeding. I remember when I was a teenager I read about it and came to the same conclusion as the person who posted, but I was wrong."

The Basic Speed law is also meant to keep people going above the speed limit when going below the speed limit is unsafe, as you can see in the quote below:   A person must drive at a reasonable speed.   Under this law, you can still get a ticket for driving too slow, which is likely under the speed limit.  Question of the day: If you are surround by grandmas, grandpas, and asian women driving 60mph and you are going 40mph, then who is the person not driving a reasonable speed?"

orangecounty,3d8kuk,PakistaniAmerican,8,Tue Jul 14 16:06:35 2015 UTC,"I'll give you my view of the situation as a Democrat that's moved to Irvine in the last few years.   Effectively, he was tarred and feathered by the Republicans. Whether he deserved it or not is not clear. Therein lies the problem from my view. There's enough information out there to show that he did things that at least didn't appear to be above board (even if they were). The appearance of impropriety to me is enough of a disqualifying factor. He did some things that appear sketchy... Which was enough for getting attacked, some of those attacks may or may not be substantiated. Then the Republicans were able to attach the other Democrats to him and thereby disqualify them all.  If nothing else a lot of people view him as corrupt or tainted. He's fallen from grace and the effect was terrible in the last election.  Meanwhile, Krom has been getting in what amounts to pissing matches with the Republican council and she's been attached as an Agran croney. If you look at the polls from the last election and then consider what would have happened if Agran didn't run and stepped out of the limelight, it seems like the Council would have been much more balanced (or at least a closer fight in the election).   Essentially it comes to this: Agran has very impeachable character. The Republicans went right for the throat and scored a swift kill on him and took the other two Democrats (Gaido and Fox, the former actually a pretty worthy candidate from what I could tell in my observance) with him."
orangecounty,3d8kuk,WaywardWit,2,Tue Jul 14 16:20:52 2015 UTC,Agran spends an awful lot of money with very little disclosure and the Democrats seem to be convinced that they can't win without access to his fundraising.

I know it seems like a bold statement, but Irvine has such a diverse population of both races and religions and we like it that way.  I could see them getting away with this if it was quietly done, as if it had always been there, but the moment it hits the media there is going to be backlash like you are seeing.  I just get a feeling the Republicans on the city council just go whole hog sometimes because the world is changing faster than they would like.  They get their support from older and more consevative folks who don't like how progressive the city has become.   As one of the first mixed raced kids in my school growing up (born and raised in Irvine 25+ years), I can see that the rapid change would ruffle some feathers and create a need to ""return to the traditional ways"" of things.  The neighborhood sure has changed a lot in a relatively short amount of time, even though the city is fairly young!  It's not a bad thing that this type of headlines sparks some debate.  Sometimes we, as a people, need to be tried to continue to become the best we can be.  This will hopefully help push the boundaries of what we feel of openness and acceptance.  I grew up in Irvine and I can't really ask for anything better.  I was always accepted and people were always kind, with religion, with sexuality, with differences of people.

I'm pretty sure that conservative/orthodox Jews don't approve of writing ""God."" I often see them write ""G-d."" Also I think some Muslims don't consider ""God"" to be equivalent to ""Allah."" I believe a Catholic priest in Indonesia got in trouble for using Allah during a service. It's way more complex and nuanced than God bring the monotheistic universal Reith. /rant"

orangecounty,3d7coc,littledabwilldoya,3,Tue Jul 14 20:39:25 2015 UTC,"La Habra would need to take drastic measures to have a chance. There is just too much competition from neighboring areas like Downtown Fullerton, Downtown Brea or Uptown Whittier.   If the city is willing to take advantage of the fact that residential demand is high, they could build a few hundred apartment units and three story condos within walking distance. That might bring enough new people to the area to fill in all the for lease signs in the area.   Also, the place is horribly designed for pedestrians. It was clearly designed with only one goal, making cars move quickly. If they want a downtown feel, they will need to bite the bullet and cut the road from 5 lanes to 3. Angled parking and/or a protected bike lane would also be a good idea."
orangecounty,3d7coc,road2stamfordbridge,2,Tue Jul 14 05:26:26 2015 UTC,"Realistically, not every city in OC can have a ""cool downtown."" Only few cities in the county have historic buildings that really frame your typical downtown core. Cities like La Habra have to follow the Brea example and manufacture some form of urban village in the core of their city, but it won't be anywhere near as successful as say Downtown Santa Ana or Downtown Fullerton.  I'm just glad cities that would not normally be in the conversation are thinking about it."

orangecounty,3dal8l,twojailcards,6,Tue Jul 14 22:49:53 2015 UTC,"That's kind of the point, though. It's supposed to make you think. Nonetheless, I do see what you mean about the expected connection between the brand and the art. On the other hand, perhaps by having the art piece, Tilly's is trying to get a point across to the public - that point being that they advocate thought, art, and self-expression."
orangecounty,3dal8l,Mynamesjd,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:10:56 2015 UTC,Zio Ziegler and Vans did a collaboration together and this was kind of for that. Vans has his products for sale right now at Tillys.

Just park across at Orange Coast College which is free and walk over.   Another secret free place to park at is TeWinkle Park on Arlington. It's like next to the baseball/softball field. They use to threaten us that Costa Mesa Police will ticket employees that park there but I did so the entire time of the fair because I hated the employee shuttle. Never got a ticket and people park there daily (employees and people who visit the fair)  Also if you know people that work at the fair, they are allowed to buy up to 20 tickets for $1 each. Most likely they will sell those tickets for cheaper than the $12 retail price."

The Lithium, nickel, etc does not disappear, it's still there. There are ways to separate these materials to recycle into new battery packs. And these batteries with reduced capacity can be repurposed as stationary storage for homes, utilities, and commercial properties.  Also companies like Tesla make batteries and motors without toxic or heavy metals.   States like CA have also commited to phase out coal power plants and transition to cleaner and renewable sources. Also, solar panels can be added with a relatively small footprint on roofs (compared to large power plants). Solar is becoming cheaper to produce and install as well.

Just south is lake forest which will give you some hills to ride and it's slightly less boring and slightly less expensive.  Edit. Read that you were working in irvine, opps!

orangecounty,3cqpca,darkwing42,1 point,Fri Jul 10 06:59:07 2015 UTC,"Tragedy of the commons:       The tragedy of the commons is a term, originally used by Garrett Hardin, to denote a situation where individuals acting independently and rationally according to each's self-interest behave contrary to the best interests of the whole group by depleting some common resource. The term is taken from the title of an article written by Hardin in 1968, which is in turn based upon an essay by a Victorian economist on the effects of unregulated grazing on common land.  ""Commons"" in this sense has come to mean such resources as atmosphere, oceans, rivers, fish stocks, the office refrigerator, energy or any other shared resource which is not formally regulated; not common land in its agricultural sense.  The tragedy of the commons concept is often cited in connection with sustainable development, meshing economic growth and environmental protection, as well as in the debate over global warming. It has also been used in analyzing behavior in the fields of economics, evolutionary psychology, anthropology, game theory, politics, taxation, and sociology. However the concept, as originally developed, has also received criticism for not taking into account the many other factors operating to enforce or agree on regulation in this scenario.

orangecounty,3cr6gh,Whisper,4,Fri Jul 10 21:39:47 2015 UTC,"Well, finding work without a specialized, in-demand skill is always difficult, so don't expect miracles. However, the difference between the high desert and orange county is that orange county has a lot more wealth, and wealthy people, so the demand for service-sector workers is somewhat higher.  I'm not in a position in life where I've looked for ""general work"" for many decades, so I can't speak directly to what your experience will be like, but I do see a fair amount of ""now hiring"" signs in the windows of businesses out here, so you have that going for you, which is nice.   The cost of living difference may be a bit of a shock, though."

Going through that same period of being young and flat broke is an experience that often sucked at the time, but I'm glad I went through it. It not only makes you appreciate and enjoy what you have when you do get that career going, but it also teaches you how to manage money, and how to save it by not spending it on stupid shit that brings you no pleasure.   Good luck."

It was only 6 miles each way, which took a little over 3 hours. When the trail went inland a bit, its desert landscape and you definitely feel the heat. But at the top of some ridges we got blasted with cool gusts coming off the water and up 1000 foot slopes, amazing, like out of a John Steinbeck book. You have to go.  50 miles on one trip is no joke tho. How many days were you planning? There was no shade where we were and no streams. Assume you'll need to carry 4-5 liters of water to do a full day hike in the heat.

I'm an IT guy and I can build my own wordpress website using templates but I would like the web person to have an understanding on how to build a template rather then just relying 100% on the limitations of a template.  Two of the customers don't even have websites currently despite being in business for many years. The websites from my understanding will pretty much be standard wordpress functionality, showing what the company does, perhaps showcase products, etc and contact information and contact form.  One has a website however its pretty much built from the early 2000s so it just looks extremely outdated and they want an up to date site that shows their products and photo gallery.  Obviously with the businesses that don't even have websites currently it would be important to build in time for potentially content creation or time working with the businesses to help them create their website or populate it with content.   As far as amount payed its just going to depend on the individual businesses owners themselves but I would expect it to be market rate. Its hard to say how much since a website that just needs 4-5 pages, main page, about us, contact form, services may be really simple and not require much work. Whereas some of the owners might want much more extensive work. I'm not expecting anything complicated but I'm just trying to avoid someone who doesn't know how to tweak a template a bit if for whatever darn reason they want the logo box on the template moved from the left to the right or something that can't be customized without editing the css or php files directly. The cost just has to make sense with the amount of work involved and I can work with them on setting up their expectations right."

I got big, fast, doing this. Now I work in house and lead my own team, but still wish I had this workflow."

We were not able to remove any of the penetrations we could only treat the symptoms. The venom if you will, in the barb is neutralized by warm water. So when you see people suggesting to pee on it its not due to the contents of the urine but the warmth. We always had coolers full of warm water that people can soak their feet in.  More importantly though we would treat for anaphylaxis. Some people would have allergic reactions to the venom and the penetration.  So kids, listen up. Don't let your friends pee on you, just find some warm water and soak."

orangecounty,3c11vm,GymPartner,4,Fri Jul 3 20:01:32 2015 UTC,"Hi there! I am close to your age and I also have my real estate license for the state of California. Real estate is a hard business.   1) Your age works against you. You need knowledge. You need to know more and put in 110% more work than the people that have been doing this 10+ years.   2) It's commission only. You will have to spend a lot of time doing open houses, walking door to door, setting up a ""farm"" and constantly reaching out to those people to see you as the ""go to"" realtor for a certain area.   3) You cannot sell real estate without a license and hanging your license with a broker (Keller Williams, Realty One, BHHS, etc etc)  4) It's all about connections. You either have to work for someone starting out or you're gonna have a bad time.   At the moment I am not working with a broker and not actively involved in real estate as I have gone back to school. My advice would be to take a class at your local community college, find a realtor that's close to your age and interview them. The Bureau of Labor Statistics states that realtors make 40K per year. But keep in mind you have to pay for classes, copyright fees, and broker fees, and some type of added insurance on your car for when you are driving clients around.   If you have any questions, feel free to ask!"
orangecounty,3c11vm,somenewfiechick,3,Sat Jul 4 00:59:30 2015 UTC,"I'll just let you know that real estate is a ""fall back"" job.  Don't count on it to make your livelihood unless you have a ton of friends who are going to need houses.  It's really easy to get licensed and pretty much anybody with half a brain can do it, so there's a realtor on every street corner.  You might as well look into finance, or if you're a sucker for doing the grunt work of other people do escrow- all those things you say you like..."
orangecounty,3c11vm,TheRoach,1 point,Sat Jul 4 01:07:16 2015 UTC,"Hi.

I also work on negotiations, closing, marketing, etc. I also travel all over the world meeting lots of interesting people and seeing a lot of interesting applications.

To qualify for one of these, an individual must have impaired mobility that is documented by a health care professional.

Since I couldn't get past her car I had to go elsewhere to eat.
orangecounty,3bqydi,Brutal_Ink,-6,Thu Jul 2 09:07:28 2015 UTC,OP call a tow truck next time instead of posting it online. You had two choices and you chose the one that doesn't do jack shit. It's clear  you recorded her solely because a little public shaming probably goes a long way. But next time  maybe call and then film in case she leaves

orangecounty,3bqydi,Ojisan1,43,Thu Jul 2 01:29:39 2015 UTC,"The person making the video is trying to appear non-combative and conciliatory. The act of video recording is perceived by idiots like the woman in the video to be ""threatening"" and so, acting aggressively will make her feel entitled to confront him - perhaps with violence or try to damage his camera. By being soft-spoken, he is able to record without further escalating the situation beyond that."
orangecounty,3bqydi,NathanielGoldfinch,10,Thu Jul 2 09:09:19 2015 UTC,I agree well done OP.
orangecounty,3bqydi,gundy949,9,Thu Jul 2 00:45:57 2015 UTC,Public shaming needs to make a comeback in society; when assholes act like they're above the rules that we all buy into then there needs to be some consequences (even if it is being embarrassed and shamed by a total stranger in public).
orangecounty,3bqydi,gundy949,2,Thu Jul 2 05:21:23 2015 UTC,"Video taping her?  Yes, its completely passive.  The woman could have gotten in her car and left without any sort of issue.   I agree it would be great if a tow truck had been there to tow her but thats not always the case and there should be SOME reaction from society when people do these dickish things."

orangecounty,3boqmy,trackdaybruh,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:01:47 2015 UTC,"The cons about a strong El Nino is that hurricane hitting West Coast is strongly likely, rather than hitting the coast of Mexico since El Nino basically pushes all the weather North towards us."
orangecounty,3boqmy,Mischaw,2,Wed Jul 1 05:10:40 2015 UTC,Strongly likely where? Mexico maybe. This year is being compared to '97 when hurricanes in the eastern pacific sent wonderful surf our way
orangecounty,3boqmy,trackdaybruh,1 point,Wed Jul 1 07:02:21 2015 UTC,"It depends on the strength of El Nino. El Nino is the change of wind pattern --> which changes the temperature of the ocean --> which also influences weather including storms/hurricanes. Usually, the so-cal waters tends to be colder than normal, this discourages any hurricane from Mexico from moving North. However, during El Nino, the oceans around Southern California (and West Coast area all the way to Alaska) gets even warmer where it encourages the hurricane from Mexico to move North.  I believe the 97' Hurricane Nora actually hit California. The hurricane-force winds then hit Dixie National Forest in southwestern Utah where it did damage also."

orangecounty,3bme22,cuteman,4,Tue Jun 30 18:49:45 2015 UTC,so they can make you compare the food while its still recent in your mind.  Just buy a 99 cent burrito at Taco Bell and get your reciept to eat here.

orangecounty,3bme22,unitedballers,1 point,Thu Jul 2 00:08:56 2015 UTC,I think it controls how much free product they're giving away. I probably have a less chance of going and getting one because I don't feel like going somewhere else to get a receipt.

orangecounty,3bme22,mawnck,1 point,Tue Jun 30 21:11:14 2015 UTC,Freegums has it right. They want you to compare their competitors' food to theirs. (Although I would assume that you could buy 5 Taco Bell burritos for the cost of one of theirs.)  Obviously they don't expect you to pick up your free burrito and eat it for the same meal as the other burrito.   Hmmm … Perhaps they're giving their customer base too much credit?

orangecounty,3bjsjl,UnluckyPenguin,10,Mon Jun 29 21:07:22 2015 UTC,"*edit: Using the extra condensation is a great idea if you know your AC is hooked up right.  That's not a good thing. Most AC units have a primary and secondary overflow. The water flowing out of the exterior wall of the home is meant as a back up when something is not right. I recommend you get it checked out.   Central air conditioners in some residences incorporate a primary condensate drain pipe plumbed into the household sewer drain and a secondary backup pipe that drains to the exterior of the home in some conspicuous place if the primary pipe becomes clogged. Water flowing from the backup drain pipe is an alert that a potentially damaging overflow condition is developing in the condensate drain pan. Any amount of water discharged from a backup drain pipe is too much and should prompt a call to a heating, ventilation and air conditioning contractor.   Source"
orangecounty,3bjsjl,UnluckyPenguin,10,Mon Jun 29 21:11:42 2015 UTC,"Keyword here is ""some residences.""  When we had it installed, it was more work to pipe the condenser runoff into the sewer line than to simply cut a hole in the wall of the attic and let it drain outside (the blower and condenser are literally right on the other side of the wall) so that's what they did.  Really, I can't imagine the problems we would've had if they had tried to tap into the sewer line, or the hassle of dropping PVC from the attic into the crawlspace.  We just had the AC serviced a week ago, and other than needing a new capacitor, it was in perfect condition.  Edit - from your article   In most homes, the condensate drain pipe conveys water either to a drain point outside the house or to a connection with the household sewer."

East Side of Costa Mesa is a huge target for break-ins and burglaries because bandits know wealthier people live there.

That's it. It doesn't matter how you look like, what you wear, what religion you belong to (or don't), etc.   You (not you lol) can't give us ONE race. There are many races.  Also, Asian isn't a race either. How about white and black? All whites/blacks don't look the same to me.   I understand what the graphic is trying to say, but it's not correct.   It would have been more interesting to see skin color."
orangecounty,3bh6vk,cj5,0,Sat Jul 4 16:32:48 2015 UTC,IMO this map makes OC look segregated because the red/blue/yellow areas stand out so much. My current apartment complex as well as my last one were both pretty diverse and it shows on the map.

orangecounty,3bh6vk,Asdyc,3,Mon Jun 29 16:05:05 2015 UTC,"I understand why you're getting downvoted but you make a good point (sort of). SoCal is very diverse but it's what we call segregated diversity. Essentially, every race likes to stick together with what they are comfortable with. Hispanics stay with Hispanics. Asians stick with Asians, and whites with whites. There are few neighborhoods in the county that we can actually call diverse by the standard typical definition."

Selfie sticks have only been really popular mainstream for a few months.   You say ""getting out of control"" like it was easily manageable anymore than a viral video. Thousands of these sticks were coming into the parks daily.   They reacted as quickly as they could. The whole development between popularity, widespread ownership, ride bans, then parkswide bans took less than 6 months. That's fairly quick.   They don't want to piss customers off, and think of how many don't know about this rule and go back to their cars or throw them away (some people walk from hotels)? But it's all about safety and liability."
orangecounty,3bfqv5,cuteman,1 point,Sun Jun 28 23:39:55 2015 UTC,"They weren't banned from the park, just on rides. This was the only rational outcome as they were not banned in the park hence no policy to confiscate someone's property."

orangecounty,3bgz8q,cowboi,2,Mon Jun 29 18:01:47 2015 UTC,"Depends on where you want to stay. I saw a redditor say San Clemente and while it's nice its very FAR from a lot of Orange County. Depending on your budget, the beach towns might not be a realistic option. If you want affordable and decent areas, try Orange, Tustin, or Brea. They're a bit of suburbia but close enough to things to do for fun. Fullerton/HB is good if you want nightlife. To be honest, depending on if you like the nightlife, you want to be as close to LA as possible because honestly OC's nightlife is lacking a bit. I'd say to avoid certain parts around Anaheim & Santa Ana.   I don't really know your budget but hopefully you have some money saved because a job might not come right away once you get out here and the last thing you need is to worry about how to pay the bills and feed yourself and your dog.  If you have further questions feel free to ask. I used to live in OC and frequent it a lot. Love it but LA is where work is."

The 91 is the WORST of the worst according to them - that stretch is what traffic nightmares are made of.  There is not a train.  Use the google maps traffic estimator.  If you were to drive it right now its a 30 minute drive from Irvine to Corona.  However, if you drive it on a Monday morning (assuming the 91 to the 241/ 261) anytime from 6AM - 9AM its 1 hour 5 minutes from Corona to Irvine.

(Weekends are a crap shoot either direction any time of day.)  It can take longer than it should to travel those 2-3 miles/exits between the 241 and Corona though. If you have to use the 71 to get in an out of Chino, add more time to your commute. But overall it's not that bad - it's not like you have to drive into Riverside or beyond."

Here are the lines from Irvine Station   If you are thinking the train, using Metrolink over Amtrak should save you money. Do your research, MetroLink service is sometimes limited by their schedule.

And make sure that you find a house manager (aka: landlord) that tries not to snoop in your personal life. I still hang out with my Burning Man friends all of the time and no one tells me what to do.  But I have over two years clean and really active in recovery and my UU church in Costa Mesa."

Turn right onto that and take the first left which will take you to a parking lot of a school. Park there and walk past the school and across the field until you see a concrete trail that goes up with steps. Follow that up and climb the rocks and you will reach the top.

orangecounty,3b9d9m,billytuffnuts,8,Sat Jun 27 01:20:33 2015 UTC,"On Target is way overpriced. Check out OC Firearms they have great prices.  As for a gun range I recommend FT3 Tactical all state of the art stuff and cheaper than On Target which seems a bit outdated.  Make sure to bring two forms of ID for your handgun purchase. Like a lease and a Car registration.  Take a class for beginners, and learn the basics of shooting. But get yourself something in 9mm. Don't buy the gun until you've taken your intro class. And you'll be good. That's how I started.  If you have any questions feel free to P.M. me."
orangecounty,3b9d9m,fade1r,6,Sat Jun 27 01:50:46 2015 UTC,"I scoured OC for the best price possible on my Glock. After I bought it, I went to FT3 to shoot and saw they have guns for sale... And it was over a hundred dollars cheaper. I talked to one of the staff and he said they make money on ammo, so their margins are razor thin on guns. It's definitely where I'd go to buy another."

orangecounty,3b9d9m,snarky_answer,2,Sat Jun 27 03:07:07 2015 UTC,I had to wait 10 days for my rifle. I know it's right away if you have already owned a firearm but not for the first weapon.
orangecounty,3b9d9m,krex_,3,Sat Jun 27 03:47:09 2015 UTC,"Take the HSC test. Read the study guide here: http://oag.ca.gov/firearms/fsc   It's not long and the information is pretty solid. Once your happy with it, go take the short test at a local store/range. Call ahead to make sure they offer it but many do. Once you have that you can look into buying one used or new but that comes first."
orangecounty,3b9d9m,TBatWork,4,Sat Jun 27 01:33:20 2015 UTC,"There's a Firearm Safety Certificate you have to get for handguns. I took the test at Fowler's in Orange, and most shops should have the materials on hand or be able to direct you on where you can take the test.   Some gun stores and ranges have used firearms for sale. They may also have a notice board where people post ads for selling firearms. If you buy a firearm directly from someone, the transaction and paperwork has to be filled out and filed at a licensed dealer.   There's a ten day waiting period after purchase. I don't remember if I had to wait the ten days when I bought a firearm from a friend.   I recommend getting something in .22, because it's a relatively cheap and easy to shoot round. You'll get more range time and develop better habits with it."
orangecounty,3b9d9m,majornerd,5,Sat Jun 27 01:38:53 2015 UTC,"The laws are easier if you buy a gun from a gun store.    You will need a handgun safety certificate. Study and take a short test.  You will need two forms of ID. A state issued ID showing your current address is required as well as a second form of is the corresponds with the same address. This can be vehicle registration, power bill or cable bill.  Something that has your name on it and verifies the address. Vehicle registration is the best. There will be a background check fee on top of the cost of the gun and tax.  There will be a 10 ""day"" wait. It is specifically defined as 10 24hour periods. What the means is if you buy the gun (look at your receipt) at 4:35 pm on 7/1/2015 it will not be available for pickup one second before 4:35pm on the 11th of July. Some places will not release the gun before the 11th day just to be sure.    I typically recommend a .22 as a first gun, but the availability of .22 Lr ammunition may make it difficult."
orangecounty,3b9d9m,iLoveLamp83,3,Sat Jun 27 02:05:50 2015 UTC,"Yours seems to be the most comprehensive answer.  I would disagree on the .22 as a first gun, though that's a matter of personal preference.  I also second /u/slurmloko 's referall to calguns, and /ufade1r 's recommendation of FT3.  I'd also point out that hand strength is a factor for choosing a semi-automatic vs. revolver. My ex gf would need me to load her magazines and pull her slide at the range. And I have a male friend whose arthritis makes loading a magazine difficult. Meanwhile revolvers are generally simpler and don't require as much hand strength."
orangecounty,3b9d9m,majornerd,2,Sat Jun 27 16:36:09 2015 UTC,Agreed.   My standard practice when helping someone pick their first gun is a trip to the range with them and 15-20 of my steel and polymer friends to see what fits and how they shoot.   A .22 is not a bad recommendation for someone I cannot do that with.   However the best advice is a trip to the range and some time at the rental counter.
orangecounty,3b9d9m,Kubi74,0,Sun Jun 28 03:19:43 2015 UTC,wait? what? 22s are out of stock now?

orangecounty,3b5wgy,shaunsanders,1 point,Sat Jun 27 05:25:37 2015 UTC,Proving my point in it's entirety. If you already have two parks that get packed to the brim with the current attractions why bother investing 1 billion + unless you get some kind of concession.
orangecounty,3b5wgy,lozaning,1 point,Mon Jun 29 16:59:26 2015 UTC,"Your assumption is that Disneyland makes its big money based on the sale of tickets and annual passes. This is false.   Disneyland makes its big money on merchandise, food and beverages, and good will. The current parks arguably sacrifice these, as it is becoming more common for folks to visit for brief periods, ride a few rides, then head home. This means no staying around for dinner or lunch, no snacking, and no perusing through gift shops.   By adding another park, they create not only another vector for selling merchandise, but they reduce crowd densities, increase overall enjoyment, and gain better access to a person's wallet.   I'm not saying they don't have some bargaining power in all of this, but it looks like more of a bluff than sound business judgment."
orangecounty,3b5wgy,shaunsanders,1 point,Mon Jun 29 17:51:41 2015 UTC,And your assumption is that the Walt Disney Company makes it's big money on the parks at all.   Segmented operating income for their media networks is an order of magnitude higher then that of the parks and resorts.   http://thewaltdisneycompany.com/sites/default/files/reports/q2-fy15-earnings.pdf  It may make more sense for them to buy the tv rights to the world cup for ESPN than to invest in building a new park. It's all a matter of what offers the best return.
orangecounty,3b5wgy,lozaning,1 point,Mon Jun 29 18:32:09 2015 UTC,"What you just said is neat... but it is not at all relevant to what we are talking about.  We haven't been talking about the Walk Disney Company, we've been talking about Disneyland, a property in Anaheim which is being faced with a choice of either expanding or not. So yes, in terms of WDC's entire empire of profits, the amount of money they make off their media networks surpasses nearly all other revenue streams combined.  Yet, despite that, WDC still seems to maintain its other revenue streams, including parks and resorts. Why could that be? Brand saturation? Diversification? It doesn't matter. Not for what we've been talking. What matters is that WDC obviously has a vested interest in maintaining those other revenue streams, even though they are substantially less profitable segments.  So let's look at what's relevant from the numbers you're using. We can see that the EBIT for WDC's parks and resorts for 2015 Q1 was $566 million. Their EBIT for consumer products during the same period was $362 million.  Furthermore, if you read into the detailed breakdowns of the numbers, you'd see that part of the $566M includes much of what I was talking about earlier (food, merchandise, etc.). From page 3:   Guest spending growth was primarily due to increases in average ticket prices at our theme parks and cruise line, increased food, beverage and merchandise spending and higher average hotel room rates.    To put this another way, if you are familiar with Disneyland in Anaheim, and how there is Downtown Disney outside of the gates, ""consumer products"" appears to be all the sales that area made on all merchandise not inside of the parks (like that big disney store right outside of the gates), while ""parks and resorts"" includes merchandise, food, beverages, and everything else + revenues from ticket sales inside of the parks.  So the actual value of merchandise in 2015 Q1 was $362M + whatever portion of the $566M is attributable to in-park-sales.  Finally, the numbers you are using, overall, are pretty inapplicable to this discussion because we are talking about the decision Disneyland will need to make re: increasing their park and whether or not they want to pay a tax, because the segmentation numbers they provide are EBIT (Earning Before Interest and Taxes). So even if they had to pay the tax, it would not be factored into these numbers (which draws into question what other liabilities aren't being factored in which may reduce that $566M further).  tl;dr: If you want to talk about overall financial decisions of WDC, I'm game. But if you'd prefer to continue talking about what we have been talking about, then I appreciate you finding me those numbers which are only relevant to support what I've been saying already."

orangecounty,3b4u3q,mskillens,5,Thu Jun 25 23:53:14 2015 UTC,At least they gave a tootsie pop with they flyer.
orangecounty,3b4u3q,Chodi_Foster,19,Fri Jun 26 04:28:05 2015 UTC,"My theory is it isn't even a Klan organization dropping the flyers. It's some high school kid just trying to rile people up.  It doesn't even sound like there's any information on HOW to join the Klan if you want to - just a link to a website and a phone number with a disgusting recording.  It's terrible regardless, but I don't think the KKK is hinging its recruitment numbers on 100 flyers in Fullerton..."
orangecounty,3b4u3q,iLoveLamp83,18,Fri Jun 26 02:00:31 2015 UTC,"Nope, sorry to break it to you, but it really is the Klan. They're still around. They did it in a number of communities nationwide, presumably ones where one of the members had an operational car and access to a Xerox machine (and the mental capacity to operate both). Fullerton was just the lucky one for California.  I'd have to be a pretty damn committed racist to eat a Tootsie Pop that came in a bag with a Klan flyer in it.  Interesting that the Fullerton police don't consider it criminal. Most jurisdictions seem to be after the perps for littering.   And in case anyone missed it, which a lot of news reports and police seem to have, the Tootsies were an African tribe. The legend is that Tootsie Rolls (being brown) were named for the tribe, although the company has always strenuously denied it, maintaining that the founder's daughter was nicknamed Tootsie."
orangecounty,3b4u3q,mawnck,4,Fri Jun 26 03:29:00 2015 UTC,"None of what you said makes it more probable to actually be a legitimate flier from the KKK.   Does the KKK still exist? Yes. Are there racist people in Orange County? Definitely. Does the KKK have a presence in Fullerton to the point of organizing some random distribution of fliers and candy to a very localized region? Who knows...  But what I do know is there are way more teenagers and trolls than there are racist folks, and this is an easy way to provoke this very type of news report. I mean, even the flier looks like something a kid put together... It is a KKK flier with ""in California"" scrawled on it in sharpie.   Also note that we are getting into Summer with more and more kids with nothing better to do than try to get something on TV.   So sure, it could be some pathetic cheapy flier made by the KKK randomly targeting Fullerton... Or it could be a troll. My money is the latter."

I mean, even the flier looks like something a kid put together   We ARE talking about the KKK, you know.   Much as I'd like to agree with you, the fact that the flyer matches those found in the other communities nationwide indicates that there is some sort of organization behind it.   And honestly, KKK vs. trolling idiots … is that even a hair worth splitting?"
orangecounty,3b4u3q,mawnck,0,Fri Jun 26 15:20:48 2015 UTC,"Much as I'd like to agree with you, the fact that the flyer matches those found in the other communities nationwide indicates that there is some sort of organization behind it.   Or, you know, the fact that Google exists and the flier is easily found and printed. Again, look at the image of this... It's a generic flier you can download off google with a hand written ""in California"" scrawled in sharpie.   And honestly, KKK vs. trolling idiots … is that even a hair worth splitting?   Yes. Because if it is actually the KKK, and done by legitimate racists, then it is appropriate to report about it, get outraged, and show that such hate speech isn't tolerated.   But if it is trolls, then treating it like the KKK only rewards the trolls with the reaction they wanted and encourages them to do it again. People go through a lot of hassle to prank society, and this shows that all you have to do to get nationwide news coverage and outrage thousands of people is spend about a quarter on copies, a few bucks on candy, and a 20 minute drive.  Feeding trolls begets more trolls. That's why it's worth figuring out the source of these things, especially when it is so obviously within the likelihood of being some random kids trying to get a rise out of everyone.   It's like Westboro Baptist Church. They exist because they offend people. If everyone would stop feeding into their strategy, they would fade away into obscurity."
orangecounty,3b4u3q,shaunsanders,3,Fri Jun 26 15:50:41 2015 UTC,"Because if it is actually the KKK, and done by legitimate racists, then it is appropriate to report about it, get outraged, and show that such hate speech isn't tolerated.   I don't think you're getting my point. You are speaking of the KKK as if it's a real organization like the John Birch Society (or, for that matter, Westboro Baptist Church). It's not.   It's like the anons on 4chan - if you say you're KKK, then you are.  Note that you're also now splitting hairs concerning ""legitimate racists"". What the heck is a ""legitimate racist""? Those fliers not racist enough for you?  Whether they deserve coverage for it is another matter, but I suspect the residents of Fullerton, at least, consider it pretty damn newsworthy. Even if it was some bored kid."
orangecounty,3b4u3q,mawnck,-1,Fri Jun 26 16:00:33 2015 UTC,"Those fliers are indeed racist, but their intent may not be to actually promote racism. Their intent may just be to offend and garner attention.   If that is true, then reacting to them this way will result in more fliers.   So do you hate the fliers? Do you want them to stop, or do you want it to be more frequent? Because if it is just trolls behind it then giving it attention more is asking for it to happen more often because it proves to trolls it works."
orangecounty,3b4u3q,shaunsanders,3,Fri Jun 26 17:34:34 2015 UTC,"What their intent ""may be"" is immaterial.   Yeah, it'd be swell if the news media ignored all racism and hate and general assholery so it gets bored and goes away. (God knows we've seen a ton of that this week, what with the SCOTUS delivering a 1-2 punch to the Conservatives' hopes and dreams.)   Not gonna happen. Not in a million billion years. Of course I hate the fliers, but I have no control over whether they stop or become more frequent, and neither do you. So again, I ask you what difference does any of this make? Official KKK or punk high schooler with time on his hands?   It's like arguing about who peed in your pool. Who cares? There's pee in the pool!  Besides … Right this second, we're both giving our clicks to goddamn REDDIT, FFS, a website that has done more to allow racism to circulate, flourish, and ""become cool"" than all the xeroxed KKK fliers of the last 30 years combined. So we aren't exactly blameless in this thing."
orangecounty,3b4u3q,mawnck,-3,Fri Jun 26 19:07:54 2015 UTC,"What their intent ""may be"" is immaterial.   That's where we disagree, then.  Allow me to offer an analogy... taking the life of another person is bad... but not all instances of taking a life are equally bad. It's why we have terms ranging from ""involuntary manslaughter"" to ""felony murder."" It isn't to say someone who takes someone else's life via involuntary isn't a bad person... but I think you would agree they aren't as bad as someone who commits a premeditated killing in cold blood.  Likewise, I'm not saying that these fliers aren't offensive, or that the people who distributed aren't bad people -- I'm saying that if they are handing the fliers out just to cause a stir, those individuals may not actually be racist... just jerks. In fact, whoever did it may not even be white. Like it or not, there are plenty of people who use horribly offensive things as a means to cause a stir. For example, there was a story about how feet have been washing up on the shore of Canada and authorities aren't sure where the source is... most notably, though, is the fact that since the public was made aware of it, there have been several instances of people placing fake feet around as a hoax.  People have been committing hoaxes since... ever, and hoaxes are only as viable so long as people like you immediately jump to the conclusion that the hoax is legitimate.   So again, I ask you what difference does any of this make? Official KKK or punk high schooler with time on his hands?   If you don't see the substantive difference between an inappropriate teenage hoax and actions by an organization systematically devoted to racism to perpetuate their historical roots of physical harm and oppression towards minorities, then I feel like we've reached an impasse in our discussion.   It's like arguing about who peed in your pool. Who cares? There's pee in the pool!   Take this point for example... we see the world in a very different way. While I of course don't want anyone to pee in my pool, and while, in the end, pee ends up in the pool... it absolutely matters why someone would pee in the pool. Was it an accident due to a medical condition? Well sure, pee in the pool sucks, but I'd be kind of a jerk to hold it against the person. Was it just supposed to be a joke, and the person has some mental issue where they aren't aware that it isn't funny, but they can be taught to stop doing it or never do it again? Then yeah, the person sucks... but hey, at least talking to them can prevent it from happening again. Or did the person pee because they hate me so much that they wanted me to swim around in it because they get pleasure from it? Well, in that instance, that person isn't being invited back to the pool and I'd definitely not be friends with them.  The second you reduce an issue to black and white, you've lost any hope of actually fixing the problem and, instead, have settled for simply reacting to those problems... which doesn't necessarily help the situation. Take the Barbara Streisand Effect, where taking action against an otherwise harmless act results in exponentially increasing the occurrences of that act.  But again, at this point, we've kinda reached a point of beating a dead horse. All I am saying is that this looks like it was the act of some kids trying to get a rise out of the public (and circumstances surrounding it also support this), and it worked. If I'm wrong, though, then worst case scenario is that there is sone lone racist running around passing out stupid fliers, and we have now legitimized his actions by giving him air time and playing the role of victims when we should have laughed at how absurd it all is.  That is, after all, how we as a country destroyed most of the KKK... we reduced them to the joke that they are. Being victims empowered them... exposing them as silly pathetic human beings crushed them.  Anyway... like I said, I feel we've reached an impasse."
orangecounty,3b4u3q,shaunsanders,3,Fri Jun 26 20:00:38 2015 UTC,"All I am saying is that this looks like it was the act of some kids trying to get a rise out of the public   Perhaps this is where our differences originate. I grew up in the South. Went to a high school in a medium-sized North Carolina town where there most definitely was a local organized Klan. Their pamphlets and fliers were readily accessible, and common enough that they weren't considered newsworthy. Hell, they held marches through town on a regular basis (and those WERE newsworthy).   Based on that background, this stunt does not look like the work of kids to me. I've seen the genuine article - and this is exactly what it looks like.  I think you're assuming, or at least would like to think, that there would be no organized racism in Orange County, or that if there were, the perps would have some rudimentary skills in self-promotion. And that's naive. A ""Klan"" cell would have neither the skills nor a reason to create a nice flier. A xeroxed one does just fine.  If anything, the ""Klan"" has it a lot easier now than they did when I was in high school. Our Klan didn't have Stormfront and /r/ coontown. Back then they could only circlejerk live and in person. Now they have this huge national echo chamber to work themselves up in, and to create national flier distributions. I have no intention of wasting my day perusing racist subs and websites, but I bet if you did, you could easily determine where the flier-and-tootsie-pop-in-a-baggie thing originated. The fact that it was a Tootsie Pop (which nobody seems to have ""gotten"" but the racists and those well-familiar with their bullshit) lends credence to that. I don't think a mere dumb kid would've appreciated that symbolism. That's some professional-grade racism right there.  You could be exactly right. Perhaps it IS dumb kids trying to troll the media. But again, I think it's useless to try and parse that, since the end result is the same. Racist fliers were distributed, and I doubt any African Americans who saw them were saying ""oh it must have just been a dumb kid, let's just ignore them"".   You say you want to fix the problem, but you haven't offered a solution other than to somehow force the media to not cover the flier distribution. Good luck with that!   The real fix is to cover the distribution, expose the problem, and not sweep it under the rug based on the questionable theory that perhaps it's not as bad as it looks. That's exactly the attitude that I saw all too often in the South - well-meaning people who couldn't get it through their heads that yeah, it really IS as bad as all that. Matter of fact, there was this flag that tended to constantly get a free pass, even though every damn one of the racists tended to be kind of obsessed with it ..."

orangecounty,3b42gr,Oaky_Doaky,9,Thu Jun 25 20:15:06 2015 UTC,"Sooo...I've only spent a small amount of time in Chicago (vacation, stayed around North Loop/Navy Pier).  I should preface this by saying that I love Chicago.  Love it.  The food and bar scene are just outstanding, the architure is amazing, and the sights are fantastic. Chicago felt (to me) like a cleaner, friendlier NYC.  To me, Chicago trumps OC in many of the things you talk about.  In terms of getting around, you're driving most places.  There just isn't the density of activity compared to Chicago. OC just isn't a walking-around kind of place.  Food scene / bar scene, Chicago >>> OC.  Irvine in particular is a hive of chain restaurants and unremarkable strip malls.  It's getting better, but Orange County (with some exceptions) largely goes to sleep after 9pm.  It's a much quieter and more sedate lifestyle out here.  Cost of living, Chicago is probably cheaper.  You'd have to really sit down with your old vs new salary and compare your costs (housing, utils, car, etc etc).  Golf / volleyball, OC wins here, because...  ...Chicago weather sucks ass for half the year.  I have a good friend who lives in Chicago and she keeps talking about how much weather sucks from October to April.  Out here...it's nice pretty much all the damn time.  It really boils down to what you want in terms of lifestyle--personally, I love the activity and never-sleeps kind of feeling you get from a urban environment like Chicago, but if you like a more laid-back lifestyle, the OC might be exactly what you're looking for.  Good luck!  EDIT: Forgot to address your where-to-live question.  OC is mostly suburban medium density sprawl.  If you're looking for places with more walkability and activity, Huntington Beach is good, as are some parts of Costa Mesa.  There are parts of north OC that are good, like Fullerton, particularly around CSUF.  You could also look at Orange, around Chapman University."
orangecounty,3b42gr,DingDingDao,3,Thu Jun 25 20:29:36 2015 UTC,"I'm totally with you on the areas where Chicago > OC.  That's going to be the hardest thing to give up.  But I think I need to make this jump at this point in my career.  And I can always go back to Chicago.  I'll be honest about the cost of living thing....I'm at 100K now, this new gig would be 150K+.  Cost of living shouldn't be a big deal for a single guy.  So Huntington Beach > Newport Beach?  What parts of Costa Mesa?    I appreciate the insights!"
orangecounty,3b42gr,tossy_mctosserson,7,Thu Jun 25 20:43:14 2015 UTC,"The best advice is this:  Distances are longer than they seem on Google maps, especially for socializing.  Irvine, Lake Forest and Tustin should be ruled out immediately for you.  Not because they're bad places, but without a wife and kids, you'll derisively be calling them ""the burbs"" or worse.  You MIGHT want to look into taking something at an Oakwood or other corporate apartment for two months or so.  They come furnished or not, and you can get them month to month.  YOu can then try a commute, and spend all your free time in the suggested communities.  My bet overall for you is going to be either Laguna Beach or Costa Mesa, depending where on the ""hipster vs. upscale"" spectrum you find yourself.  And since it's unknown whether this will be permanent, you'd do your self a disservice by not at least trying to get reasonably close to the beach."
orangecounty,3b42gr,-Kevin-,1 point,Thu Jun 25 22:16:53 2015 UTC,"This is great advice.  I'm definitely more ""hipster"" than ""upscale"", so maybe Costa Mesa is more my speed.  Is there an epicenter of Costa Mesa from which I'd want to start a housing search?  I'm definitely thinking about doing something temporary to get started while I find a place to live.  Finally, I don't think this would be permanent.  It would likely be for 2-3 years....although if I find a nice california girl who doesn't want to leave, I might be there for a while.  Ha!"

NB is really nice, as is Corona del Mar (CDM) and Balboa Island, but it feels a bit older (more families, cougars, fewer students/young professionals).  Costa Mesa...there are some areas around South Coast Plaza / SoCo / The Lab / The Camp (Google Map the region around 405 / Baker / Bristol / Harbor) that are pretty fun.  There's also an area from where 55S turns into Newport Ave, running all the way to 17th St, and from 17th/Newport to 17th/Irvine Ave that has a lot of new restaurants/bars cropping up.  If this doesn't make sense when you look at a map, let me know."
orangecounty,3b42gr,bacon_strip_tease,3,Thu Jun 25 21:00:02 2015 UTC,"East side costa mesa south of 17th, east of newport is a hidden gem.

orangecounty,3b42gr,sheerjewel,1 point,Thu Jun 25 22:46:02 2015 UTC,thanks for the intel! I think I'm ruling out Fullerton just because it's a hike to the office.  Is the Orange Circle the same as Old Orange?  Anywhere in particular in Santa Ana?I haven't heard anybody mention that area yet.
orangecounty,3b42gr,CoronaFamiliar,2,Fri Jun 26 14:57:02 2015 UTC,"Yes, the Orange circle is Old town Orange. Downtown Santa Ana is a little urban, but gets a bad rap for being sketchy because, well, it is, especially the area that surrounds it (I know I'll get down voted for saying this). They do have a good hipster scene there and they have fantastic dining options as well. Great place to visit, but not live (i grew up there). I think your best bet would be Costa mesa - good nightlife, close to the beach and your work."
orangecounty,3b42gr,tgallinger,1 point,Fri Jun 26 16:24:56 2015 UTC,"btw, fantastic user name.    More and more I'm starting to think Costa Mesa might be the place for me.

orangecounty,3b42gr,ericonly,1 point,Fri Jun 26 17:36:00 2015 UTC,"Thanks! I think a safe bet would be anything EAST of Newport Blvd/55 fwy between 16th though 20th is the sweet spot.  17th is where most of the bars/entertainment are.  I've never lived there but know friends who have. I should warn you that traffic will suck there, especially during summer time as you'll get the beach crowd. Just try to avoid the main roads and you should be okay."

I'm from NYC, was 29 at the time, and single and an opportunity in Irvine came up, that I ultimately took. I now work in an office building in Irvine, literally a 3 minute walk from the Spectrum.   I have a lot of friends back home that ask me how I've liked my year in OC so far and, as a city person, I liken it like this:  I'm not a fan of SUVs, and given the choice, I'll generally pick a car over an SUV because of inherent qualities that an SUV just can't offer (e.g. more nimble, faster, lower to the ground, etc.). However, I'd choose a Range Rover over just about anything because, let's face it, it's a Range Rover. Well Orange County is like the Range Rover of suburbs. I'll always prefer living in a city, but the past year in Orange County has been hard to hate. There's a ton of stuff to do, you're close to beaches, the food's awesome, you're close to LA and SD, the weather's great, and the women are really really good looking.  Ultimately, I'm not completely sold and I haven't decided whether I plan to settle down in these parts, but I've definitely enjoyed the ride thus far. If you don't have any ties holding you back from leaving (e.g. wife & kids), I'd say to go for it."

I'm defiitely a city guy (NYC has always been at the top of my list for cities I would leave Chicago for), but I think this could be a great move.

orangecounty,3b42gr,Caliquake,2,Fri Jun 26 15:03:35 2015 UTC,"I live in Chicago now (funny enough, I actually live in Lincoln Park, too!), but I'm from the Fullerton area originally. At the pay rate you're getting, you'll be able to have your pick of place in anywhere pretty nice. I think you should totally do it. Orange County is fantastic, there's something for everyone and the biggest thing I miss in Chicago is access to the outdoors. In SoCal, you have the ocean right there, mountains and world class mountain bike trails that you can swim in/ride year round. Not to mention, you list golf and volleyball as interests, well, guess what! You can play them both year round without a second thought. That said, you don't have the same drinking culture as Chicago, and bars close way earlier. You have to drive all over, but Uber is pretty big out there too, so it's not that bad if you're going out away from your place.   As others have aluded, avoid the more affluent housing cities such as Lake Forest and dull areas like Irvine because they're full of families and it'll be much too boring/quiet for you. If I were in your position, I would probably choose to live in Old Town Orange. Good luck, I'm at about the same salary level as you are out here, I just wish I could get a comparable offer back home!"

orangecounty,3b42gr,TroyTime,4,Fri Jun 26 15:33:29 2015 UTC,"I've been living in Orange County most of my life. I've also visited Chicago. I think you'll be alright man. Honestly if you want to have good food and bars you can find it, but it's true that Irvine is a baby maker town. Industrial and cookie cutter to say the least. What you'll find is the further into LA you go, the more history in archetecture and diversity there is. I'm sure that's what you'll miss the most.  Fullerton is really cool for a 21-30 age demographic because it has 2 colleges nearby. People come from all over to party in Fullerton. You can meet people from the Inland empire (IE) or orange county or even LA.  Orange has a cool nightlife and more grungy feel to it. Divey kinda bars, tattoos n beards. There's also the block which is a money pit of a shopping center n lots of teeny boppers.  Huntington has a lot of chill people but you might find its kind of hard to break into new circles there. Emphasis on might. A lot of those guys come from money.  Newport is the worst. It has some cool stuff but it's tiny and overpriced. I mean Huntington is expensive too but it's a chiller vibe there. Newport is all about who has the biggest boat n biggest car and biggest shlong. Basically a pissing contest n the women lol, forget it man.  I think you'd be the best off in Costa mesa, even though it's pretty spread out and not much of a ""center"" besides the triangle which has a few okay spots to eat at n some okay bars.  If you're okay with commuting... I'd say think about Long Beach. You can shoot down the 22 but youre probably looking at 45min to an hour each direction every day. Depends when you start n when youre off tho. It's not too far off, has a bigger city feel, shit to do at night and everything is equal proximity. Hollywood, Huntington, Fullerton, Orange, Venice, it would be a good base n has a little city ""action"". Just be careful where you choose to live. As a general rule, the more south you go the ""safer"" it is. You have to keep your street smarts up but has good nightlife for late 20s - 30 somethings.  Orange County is cool man. 2 hours to SD, an hour or less to hollyweird / Venice beach, 4 hours to Vegas, and 6 hours to San Fran all by car. If I were in your shoes, I wouldn't even think twice. You can find a decent single bed for 1200 in any of the above areas except maybe Newport or Huntington. Might be worth it to check out renting a room to save some money n figure out where you want to be before you plant your ass. Also, people are pretty friendly and easy going here... generally speaking."

orangecounty,3b42gr,M5BMW,3,Fri Jun 26 15:15:49 2015 UTC,"I live in Santa Ana on the edge of Tustin -- one thing to keep in mind is the commute you're going to have. I can tell you that driving from the Spectrum north on the 5 is going to be a bitch on the way home every day (unless you leave early). The 5 starts jamming right around Jamboree and slows to a crawl -- so you're looking at anywhere from 20-45 minutes to commute to downtown Orange depending on when you leave and how bad the traffic is.  My friend who works right next to the Spectrum and commutes to HB says it's about 30 minutes for her on the 405; Costa Mesa would be a shorter drive, so you're probably looking at around 20-25.  If it were me, I'd look into getting short term housing (6 months or less) in the Irvine area near your work, and then figure out where you want to stay for good once you get here."

Primarily the bars / pubs / nightlife happens in the orange circle in orange. If you're cool with tats, beards, n ""rough-around-the-edges"" type of seen, this would be the spot. You'll see the same type of guys in huntington, but it's a more of an affluent area there so it's a mixed crowd. Fullerton is mainly young, like fake IDs n college kids, but it's my mainstay cause you can swoop chicks pretty easy. I mean, young college girls who like to drink... and have sex. Kinda growing out of that shit thoncause all my friends are shacked up. I usually play DD and enjoy the shit fest at 2am as well. Enough about me tho.    Specifically some cool spots to check out:  Fullerton Bars: Roscoes, Heroes, Zings n if you're in the mood for a fuck fest, Back Alley or Slidebar.   Slidebar is actually one of my favorite spots after work cause the bartenders are really fuckin cool and the food is pretty fuckin good for a decent price. The band ""Lit"" owns the bar, and they regularly have live shows n cover bands on off nights. On the weekend it's top 40 n djs. I really, really like this place during the week. Not too crowded, not too dead. No cover.  Back Alley is more ""clubby"" and really turns on around midnight. Chicks come here for the last look, easy pickins. Also some live stuff during the week. No cover.  Roscoes has a big outside patio area, and is where a lot of cool people go. I usually end up here on weekends. Does get crowded on weekends. Theres also regularly cover bands inside during the weekend and there are some older people, 40s 50s, sometimes too hangin out. You find some over indulgence but mainly people just out for a good time. Also, they have great sandwiches. Seriously, try one. No cover.  Zings is a piano bar. Therefore it's a bit older / classier crowd. Wine and shit. Might be a cover n dress code here.  Heroes wants to be Roscoes but they have a small patio. Cool part is the have huge drinks for pretty cheap. And free peanuts you can throw the shells on the ground. No cover.  If you like craft beers, there's a great spot called bootleggers in dtf. Its amazing beer, and they have a regular list and another list they rotate. Closes early though i think 11 during the week n 12 on weekends. An octoberfest type setup on a big outdoor area. I like to start my nights here. No food. No cover.  Another brewery not far from downtown fullerton called ""The Bruery"". Also no food, just really great fuckin beer.  Fullerton Food: Sushi: Sushi Momo in dtf. Reasonable, pretty good. Cool environment. Try the spicy tuna rolls, you will not regret it. I took my sister here and now whenever she comes into town it's where we go.   The Olde Ship is pretty good. Also not far from dtf. Acronym dtf = downtown fullerton. Also goes hand in hand with down to fuck it's just the area man.  El Farolito is a great hole-in-the-wall mexican spot. The best. Home made chips, family owned. It's really good man and super cheap.  There's a ton of shit in fullerton, it's seriously the epicenter of activity in orange county. Draws people from all over. I digress.  City of Orange, orange Circle:  Paul's for drinking. There's a couple other places but I can't think of em off the top of my head. Honestly you could ask some locals and they have good recommendations but just walk around old town orange or the orange circle n there's plenty of shit to do. Paul's being the best. Cheap beer, pool tournaments, beards, cussing, spitting, pitchers, sometimes the bouncers will smoke the joint if it's going around, let people fight til they're done. It's a man's bar. I like it.  The outlets of orange, formerly known as ""the block"". Here is lots of teenagers, movie theaters, it's like the spectrum. Shopping, common restaurants like Buffalo wild wings, Dave and Busters, there's a cool bowling alley, it's a shopping center. Money pit. There's a bar called Saddle Ranch which is pretty cool tho, there's a mechanical bull n drunk bitches like getting on.. the guy with the control also likes it n gives you a good show. There's also one at the Triangle in Costa mesa.  Huntington:  Beer Co.: Also a brewery. Good beer. Girls wearing bikinis from the beach. Two thumbs up. Super friendly, kinda hippie, but I think that's huntington in general.  2nd Floor: cool decor, kinda tattoo shop type vibe. Outside patio on the 2nd floor.  Sharkeez: small bar ground level. Free chips. Outside area. Not bad. Sometimes my roommate and I will hit 24HR fitness n stop there for a drink afterwards. Nothing like cycling calories.  Stay away from Fred's mexican. It blows. Idk who's cooking but it's like white people's take on mexican. Just don't man, you'll be disappointed and it's expensive because of the location (balcony that overlooks the beach). Tourist trap.  Hurricanes: Better known as Slurricanes. People get hammered at this bar. Dance floor, club music. Cover charge 5 or 10 bucks.  Aloha Grill is famous for their Rainbow drink. I'm a beer guy, but 2 or 3 rainbows n you're on a good one. Food is pretty decent here.  Digest this info n hit me up if u need any more, man. I'm in London n just showered up, taking a break from sightseeing, but I'm gonna go have a few frosties."

A) You need a car B) You need a car C) Live by the spectrum in an older building if no one is moving with you. D) enjoy the drive up to LA.  Honestly it is more of an investment than a long term stay option...unless the drought turns around.  Don't buy without surveying the areas.    Young and single = Orange / Santa-ana / Irvine (spectrum)  Older/married with children = Irvine (non  spectrum)  It's that easy.

For bottle shops there's Pacific Park Market in Aliso Viejo, Dimension Liquor in Lake Forest. And don't knock the chains, places like Total Wine, Whole Foods and Sprouts do have a decent selection of local beers.     Although how long they've been on the shelves is another issue."

orangecounty,3b4dr9,powerval,2,Thu Jun 25 22:26:19 2015 UTC,"El Toro Meats on El Toro is a little mom-n-pop butcher, but they have a small, well curated craft beer selection. They get a lot of special releases, and they have them for longer because their customer base isn't super beer oriented.  Cismontane Brewing in Rancho Santa Margarita always has lots of their stuff in bottles. Their stuff is on the simpler side in general (at least compared to somewhere like the Bruery), but it's all really solid.  And I know you said non-chain, but Total Wine on El Toro has a sizable beer section. Always a good fallback."

We did that with our puppy, and the store was so loud/crazy, it was difficult to keep her focused. The trainer was also a young girl who I don't think actually had a lot of training experience -- kind of felt like they just grabbed the nearest worker and said ""Here, go do this class.""  Look into the local dog boarding places; they often offer dog training classes, and they work with dogs all day, and are usually certified. We use Wags & Wiggles in Tustin (might be too far for you, but they're great) -- they have tons of classes, great trainers, and an awesome training space. Lots of different classes, too, once you get past the initial Obedience.  For socialization, like someone else mentioned, start taking the pup to places like the mall, shopping areas, restaurants with patios, etc. Obviously be careful until you've finished all her shots, of course.  OC Dog Friendly has some great suggestions on places to take dogs."
orangecounty,3b42dg,dalek_999,1 point,Fri Jun 26 17:00:27 2015 UTC,"Check out Karma dog training in Anaheim (I think there are other locations as well) they have classes geared for puppies that are young and have not had all of their shots completed. We took out lab puppy there last  year and she did great. It's a combination of training and socialization (which puppies need in large doses). Also take your pup to dog friendly places to socialize with people (put the dog in a shopping cart and wheel it around until her Parvo vaccine is done.) Pet stores of course, Home Depot and Lowes are also great places to socialize her."

orangecounty,3b6cgi,le_emperor,0,Fri Jun 26 13:40:31 2015 UTC,"mortars, while inherently a bigger explosive, are not dangerous. If used properly they are just as safe as the ""safe and sane"" fireworks. many of those safe and sane ones are loaded to the max allowable powder. all it takes is a mistake with a fuse or shoddy construction and you have 1/2kilogram blowing up at once on the ground. mortars contain less powder and can be launched into the air. they are illegal because butthurt people dont like the noise and people being stupid can point a mortar at anything/one.

orangecounty,3b1rpg,ZeBearJueden,1 point,Thu Jun 25 09:49:03 2015 UTC,Unfortunately you pay the whole year up front but keep in mind your trainers and training partners are all world class fighters so it was worth it for me.

orangecounty,3b1rpg,beroglu,1 point,Sat Jun 27 20:43:33 2015 UTC,"I also train at Team Oyama. If you go with the monthly deduction option on the 12 month contract, it's 150 a month. I can also attest to the quality of the instruction there. They make it a key focus on making it a productive environment for beginners to grow and learn."

orangecounty,3b1rpg,runT1ME,3,Thu Jun 25 17:17:43 2015 UTC,"I quite like OC Kickboxing too.  Very friendly and nice facilities with showers so I can hop in during lunchtime on a weekday.    Pretty sure a year long contract is around $125ish (maybe a bit more now?), though depending on what classes you do, you'll have to buy your own gear.    Edit: OC Kickboxing deducts monthly from a credit card.  Considering how much fun it is, I think it's worth it for sure.  Definitely try out the jiu-jitsu classes.  I think a lot of folks come to the Muay Thai and end up loving jiu jitsu.  Both are great ways to stay in shape and a lot of fun.   They have a lot of classes too.  So I believe if you enroll in the MMA programs, even if you primarily do Muay-Thai/MMA, if you're bored on a random saturday or weeknight, you can go try a JKD or take a knife fighting class!"
orangecounty,3b1rpg,InsaneDane,1 point,Thu Jun 25 18:08:24 2015 UTC,"The fees vary depending on how many courses you're enrolled in, and once you're into the combat-athlete courses they require a 2-year commitment.  OP would probably sign up for Muay Thai, then take MMA and kickboxing courses on the house. I think it's like $99/month."

I've seen people get tickets doing it in other areas so make sure you're where they want you to be.  We usually have a little camping grill and beers and it's been fine.  I don't even really try and hide it.  I normally put the beer in a red cup, but have had friends drink straight from the glass bottle so I don't think you need to try and hide it.  Just have a bag for trash and keep your area clean and they'll leave you alone as long as you're not being a disturbance."
orangecounty,3azqxp,slntdth7,2,Wed Jun 24 20:52:58 2015 UTC,"Sadly, you cannot tail gate there anymore.  I've put beer in red cups in the stadium lot - or in a del taco cup.  We've changed our tailgating lot to the lot on State College and Orangewood corner. It's a warehouse but you can park behind it. I went 2 weeks ago and it was crazy. Almost everyone was drinking. And it's secluded since its in the back of the yard for the warehouse. The rear gate is also open so you can walk onto the Angels parking lot in 30 seconds. The only issue is restrooms. Either bring some Travel John's if tailgating a couple of hours, a cup, or make the walk to a restroom in the Stadium Lot.  Keep in mind, on Sunday games the lot may not be open as early as some of the others on Orangewood. But when the lot is open, tailgate central. The lot may also not open up as early on night games as well. We've only run into the issue of the lot not being open at 10am (like Orangewood) on 1 Sunday"

Using open air tray carts, from a Toyota mini van, which sat with the back door open for about 30 minutes while 3 girls giggled and fucked around on their phones then not practicing safe handling procedures to get the trays into the shop. Gross."

I'm more concerned about places like one old liquor store near me. If you look up their inspection records, they seem to have rat and/or mice infestations almost every time the inspectors show up, but they still manage to stay in business. It's in an beach community, so I'm sure if they continually showed a C rating it would quickly go out of business. It's businesses like that that are the reason that OC needs letter ratings. Studies gave show that when a place adopts letter grades, quality goes up and reported illnesses go way down."

If he is giving away other things I'd be very worried. He may be planning on joining his wife soon and want to make sure the dogs have a home before he does it. Don't mean to ask so sharp a question. I just had alarm bells go off when I read it.
orangecounty,3ahto1,musical_throat_punch,8,Sat Jun 20 15:34:28 2015 UTC,"He's clearing out his home too. He literally cannot afford to live there on 1 income. I think his plan is to rent a room somewhere but it's hard to do that with 2 medium sized dogs. I'm not so concerned he'd join her, just that he doesn't have the financial means to keep what he had when his wife was alive. I honestly think he'd keep his dogs if he could, but he cannot find the right accommodations given all the circumstances financially and practically."

I can't help him keep them since I can't help pay for it, but I can help him find them a good home if it comes down to that. I'm sure he'd be open to options, he's at the beginning of the chaos and still figuring things out. I offered to help him look for options, I couldn't promise anything more than that as I cannot facilitate other options on my own. I can't take the dogs in personally or pay to help him keep them there, so I am asking around to see who would be interested in helping. :)"
orangecounty,3ahto1,portmanfaux,5,Sat Jun 20 16:56:36 2015 UTC,I would encourage you to urge him to not make rash decisions.  I would be happy to donate food or whatever he needs to keep the dogs at least for a little while.  This is a huge loss that really doesn't allow you to think clearly for at least a few months.  Let me know how I can help.
orangecounty,3ahto1,snarky_answer,3,Sat Jun 20 22:04:28 2015 UTC,I'm also willing to help with food for the dogs (or him) until he has a little more time to figure things out. This seems like a rash decision that he may later regret.

orangecounty,3afp65,Spectaculoos,6,Fri Jun 19 19:30:41 2015 UTC,"Irvine was formed of the Irvine family ranch.  The Irvine family started the Irvine Company but as far as I know sold it to Donald Bren some time in the late 80's after the whole S&L debacle.    Now, the Irvine Company owns and operates almost every for-rent apartment community in Irvine, as well as most or all of the shopping centers.  This explains the ubiquitous nature of the birds of paradise flowering everywhere, the same palm trees, and the same color of stucco you see everywhere you go.  I've lived in Irvine for most of my life - the big brother thing people talk about doesn't really exist except that places all look similar to each other and the rents are all more or less similarly expensive - there are few deals to be had at apartments in Irvine.  Rancho is nice - although somewhere between 10 and 20 degrees hotter than Irvine at any given time, and Irvine tends to be 10 degrees hotter than the beach communities.    Orange and Santa Ana are old - giving them a uniqueness to each other and as compared to Irvine - Irvine was only founded as a city 50 or so years ago and even then it only became a city because the Irvine's donated the land on which UCI sits - guaranteeing high rents and the success of business parks and strip malls for generations to come!"
orangecounty,3afp65,bikespoke,2,Fri Jun 19 19:59:21 2015 UTC,"This post pretty much sums it up.  I also have no idea where the ""big brother"" part came from.   Also Irvine has been listed as the top 10 safest city in the nation by the FBI for its population.  There are no bad part of town in Irvine, every corner of this city is safe.   Irvine is also home to one of Google HQ, Oculus Rift VR, Blizzard Entertainment, Vizio, Ford, Mazda, Kia, and more.  The only cons are that it's a cookie cutter suburban/city where everything is clean, perfect, and sterile--which makes it lack character when compared to the Los Angeles, San Francisco, New York City, and etc."
orangecounty,3afp65,trackdaybruh,1 point,Sat Jun 20 09:01:34 2015 UTC,"Rancho depends on what part of Irvine, but I'd say closer to 5-10 degrees warmer/cooler.  When it's 80 in Irvine, it usually isn't 100 here, that's 909 temps."
orangecounty,3afp65,anomicofficedrone,3,Sat Jun 20 02:42:34 2015 UTC,"Imagine the most genuinely uninteresting, cookie cutter planned community, and you have RSM.  Its identity is its lack of identity.  It could be plopped down anywhere in the western states and not be out of place.  It would just be another set of cul-de-sacs full of pink stucco walls and red tiles roofs.  To RSM's credit, being boring and isolated helps keep the rents down. Plus, lots off their apartments have gas stoves, which I like.  It's nice if that's what you're into, but as someone who isn't married with kids, fearful of minorities or in bed by 9PM, it's definitely not what I'm into. I'd say nearly the same of everything that is both inland and south of the 22.    As for the citrus, not much is left, and what is left is really just for show."
orangecounty,3afp65,Grey_Kit,2,Sat Jun 20 03:57:29 2015 UTC,"R.S.M is alright but it's very far from the freeways that aren't tolls. One thing about living in the more mountain area of Orange County is that most roads over here are toll highways, so you have to travel streets to get to places if you don't want to pay the high toll fee. I'm in Lake Forest city which is between irvine and mission Viejo with R.S.M south east next to mission Viejo.   Basically Irvine is big, but it is just the middle of Orange County. Orange county is huge in the aspect it has many smaller cities. I enjoy Orange county for this reason, it seems smaller cities run more efficiently. Most cities here have some sort of small/medium lake that you can go to, my area has Serrano creek park that includes horse trails and a private stable near the trails. It really just depends on what your interests are, which city you'd prefer.  The beaches are separated by culture. Laguna Beach is near the sawdust festival and attacts many artisans to the area. The beach there has tide pools as well so many educational activities are presented. Huntington is north of Laguna beach and is known for the bonfire pits. Many bbqs, surfing, and late night bonfires on weekends are enjoyed at huntington.   Santa Ana is a primarily Hispanic/Latin American culture, Orange is known for ""The Block/Shopping center of Orange"". Also to be noted is Anaheim where you go for 1 of 4 things: The Grove for shows, Honda center for Hockey or Baseball, or cheaper rent on apartments. Tustin is old town/antiques with casual strolls down old town Tustin. Brea and Placentia are more family communities. Fullerton is college/uni city with the botanical gardens. Laguna hills, Aliso viejo, and most of the southern cities are residential cities with no main feature but unique small shops within each.  Irvine is pretty much known for all the different cities put into 1. It's college/uni to your west, shopping center (the Irvine spectrum) to your south, great park and reginal park mid way/ to your east and comfortable (expensive) homes and apartments for rent in generally safer areas. The big brother concept only exists in the form of public notices and general overly cookie cutter feel of communities. The structure of the city setup is sound and I do generally agree with it. For instance, they focus on a symbiotic relationship with nature. Orange county has more trees and plants with tended landscaping that many other counties do not have because of the setup. Irvine company also has enough land to connect many trails. They even completed an overpass bridge on Jeffery and Irvine Blvd so pedestrians can continue the trail without waiting on traffic at a major intersection. The improvements I've seen after living here for 6 years now, coming from Los Angeles County originally is something I really enjoy about living here. Yes rent is higher, but when you know all your cities departments respond to issues within 5 minutes (accident on my street this past Thursday had all departments of police, firemen, and ambulance on the scene within 5 mins.), you neighborhood is beautiful, and plenty to do in the area, for me it's worth the rent.   Hope that helps! I think I got your questions all covered. Feel free to ask if you have any others :)"
orangecounty,3afp65,tinapasadena,1 point,Sat Jun 20 09:36:58 2015 UTC,"Thanks so much!  It would be great if you could offer a bit of commentary on some selected quotes below that stood out to me in my other topic; they're pretty big statements that are kind of vague, so I'd like to know if they're accurate, and if so, what they're referring to!  1)   ""the OC Sheriff's Dept. literally runs everything, they have their tentacles everywhere, from schools to doctors' offices   This. The police are super corrupt. So are the courts, judges, social services, etc. If you are a non-OC resident and have a conflict with a resident, it is a bit like being a black person in the deep south having a conflict with a white person. You're gonna lose, painfully, and with no regard to the rule of law.""  Is this true? ""From schools to doctors' offices"" sounds kind of hyperbolic to me. If the services come in 5 minutes like you say, then I can't see how they're corrupt, haha!  2)  ""Orange County politics is more centered around affluence than around conservatism (although the two things overlap considerably). It's more of a ""protect my money first, and your rights second"" mindset. Less of a ""I don't want someone to get an abortion"" and more of a ""I don't want poor people living in my neighborhood, driving down the value of my home"".""  Would you agree with this? There seem to be a lot of high-end car dealerships in the OC...but the same can be said of LA County, so again, I don't see this as being super-different.  3) ""OC is just like LA, but there's a lot more rules and regulations in OC""  A generalization? What could this poster be referring to specifically?  Lastly, a question from me: 4) Every place on Earth has its pros and cons; I'd say the pros of OC are pretty obvious, and the cons are probably earthquake and air pollution potential.  From what you know, is there a city that is less susceptible to these than others in the OC?  One thing that concerns me is that, in LA County, there's a very large and nasty-looking oil refinery (I think) that you can see from Manhattan Beach. And then Long Beach has a lot of that too.  IIRC, there's such a facility in Huntington Beach...is this a big deal? If you live close enough to see it, does that mean your chances of getting lung cancer or something are guaranteed to be higher? I've found it difficult to find unbiased sources about this. Where in the OC is the air cleanest?  And what about earthquake regulations? Is San Francisco the best in the state for having up-to-code buildings, or does Orange County have a few tricks up its sleeve? Thanks again!"
orangecounty,3aegfy,ownage99988,3,Fri Jun 19 13:35:39 2015 UTC,"Yes they are accurate, but you need to do more research. These trailers are just about always on rented land. Some places on HB has a contract that good for another 25-50 years so you just need to pay the rent and not worry yet. Some places are actually about to expire, and if you own one of these on those lands and they decide to sell it or do something else with it then you will need to move your trailer someplace else."

orangecounty,3aegfy,pollodustino,3,Fri Jun 19 14:23:28 2015 UTC,"My family's mobile home park charges an average rent of $680 a month for the space, which includes water and trash.  We're currently in the process of upgrading the water system and when that's done the tenants will have individual water meters.  We're a seniors-only mobile home park (No one under 55 excluding caregivers, etc), and we have some of the lowest rents in the county, which is one of the reasons we still have tenants from when the park opened in 1963 when it was an all-ages park.  Other parks charge more, especially if it's an all-ages park.  The prices for the homes themselves is accurate, and some of them are extremely attractive homes.  However you do have to take into account they have a limited lifespan as opposed to a traditional home, so in fifteen or twenty years you may have to start thinking about replacing the unit.  Mobile home parks can be a wonderful place to live.  Cheaper than buying a home on a traditional lot, you don't have to worry about property tax (So far as I know), but since they still feel like a traditional home (Some spaces even have little yards!) your neighbors tend to keep them up like a traditional neighborhood.    If you don't want or need a traditional home but still want that home sort of feel, mobile homes are a great way to go.  Just realize that you'll always lose money, since they can't really be resold easily, and they do need to be replaced eventually.  Oh, and don't call them trailers.  :P"

In mission viejo the average high is like 66/67 in the winter and like 88-90 in the summer. And Mission Viejo is listed at 14.1.  But if you look at some places in the Bay Area, like Berkeley, its usually a high of around 61/62 in the winter and about 71-74 in the warmer months. And Berkeley is listed at 14.  As a matter of actually living in these places, I'd argue the temperature in Berkeley is definitely more stable year round in comparison to Mission Viejo (it doesn't get nearly as hot in the Bay Area and coastal regions in general!)."

I solved that by downloading the audiobooks from the youtube downloader app   On the other hand    no snapchat and lack of many popular apps   many times when I receive texts they'll triplicate (three of the same texts in a row) sometimes when somebody calls, I either won't receive it or the phone will only ring once Here Maps (default GPS and Maps) is kind of shitty in California: it always underestimates arrival time, defaults to busy freeways even when side roads are quicker, and some times will not take you to the exact destinations if you choose it upon suggestion. I searched the Getty museum yesterday through Here Maps and it took me to a gated back entrance rather then the parking structure. there have been a handful of times ( < 10 )  where my phone didn't receive anything such as emails, texts, phone calls, internet, but was always fixed by turning it off and on again   Overall it's been a great phone!

Salsa or surfing or a scotch club or whatever.    Newport has a pretty hopping night life.  The main drag will be exceptionally busy now that's it's summer.

My rent in Albuquerque for a one bedroom apartment was $450. It was off Lomas and San Mateo, so not the best area, but not like the Warzone.  Out here we are now looking at apartments, also one bedroom, for $1300-$1400 in maybe not the best parts of Santa Ana. Right now, we're in a 2 bedroom in an ok part of Costa Mesa, and we pay $1750, not including utilites, etc. We can't afford it so we're downsizing drastically. We'd move further out of the county, but we'd pay the difference in gas and car maintenance.   Pay can vary. After leaving my previous job for medical reasons, I'm finding myself applying for jobs that are just shy of minimum wage. My first job out here was around $46,000 a year, and the most dreadful, god awful job I have ever had. But I was pretty much just hired as a warm body to do graphics. For medical reasons, I have to get out of the high stress and tight deadline world of Marketing and Graphic Design. My partner also makes about the same, and we lived comfortably, but still had to stretch a buck.   So, my advice, California is not for you my friend. Design is a saturated market with TONS of talent that will be competing for the same crappy jobs.You'll be coming from one of the cheapest areas to live in to one of the most expensive.   If you do move out here, please, please, get a job first, or else you're going to be screwed. Oh, and bring me some green chile and I'll show you around."

Yeah, rent here in Albuquerque is super cheap in comparison to SoCal, it a pretty big shock for the wallet. $17.50 for a 2 bedroom? Jeeze.  I'm going alone, so I think I would be much better off if I just rent a room for ~$500-600, to at least get started.  I'm currently applying to positions more focused around customer service instead of the other skills, since it seems there is more availability in that field to at least get started.

orangecounty,3a39tn,abqcub,4,Tue Jun 16 23:20:29 2015 UTC,"You're not getting anything in that price range, sorry. At least not in the ""good"" parts of OC. $900 is the lowest I've seen for a room or studio.  And yeah, you'd think with the cost of living being so high, that employers would pay a livable wage. Nope. If places can get away with paying you $9.00/hr, they will, and do. So anything customer service related is going to be low.  But even then, that's just OC. Have you considered LA, Long Beach, San Diego? OC is full of lots of old money, and their spoiled brood. I had big culture shock coming from 'the land of mañana' to the land of 'I'm rich, so the rules don't apply'. And the prices are reflective of that mentality."

I will usually have one arm out in front and kind of ""superman"" the wave as though I am ""flying"" with the wave. Some people get more into it and get little mini hand boards that are about the size of a frisbee."

orangecounty,3a37kj,meeshkyle,2,Tue Jun 16 22:11:13 2015 UTC,"Yes, you are thinking of Body Boarding or Boogie Boarding then. Still a very very easy thing to learn. I don't think I ever was taught. I may just have been really young, idk. But it is basically the same concept. You get a board, go out in the water, and push yourself with the board down the wave. That is the simplest way. Once you get more advances you will paddle with the board and hope the wave finishes the process of pushing you along. Once you get more advanced than that you get some fins for your feet and that helps you launch a lot better and get momentum to catch some of the bigger waves.   But, to answer your initial question. I haven't really heard of any lessons for that really. Mostly just standard surfing. Maybe check for some beach camps. I was enrolled in a beach camp as a kid (can't remember what age) and went to the beach like 2 or 3 times a week with a big group during the summer. There will probably be some other kids in there that can help teach him or maybe some of the adults watching the kids that can help. I think mine was with like a boys and girls club or something."

orangecounty,3a37kj,ALLEGEDLY_ERECT,2,Wed Jun 17 01:57:02 2015 UTC,"You're thinking of body boarding. I'm sure there's shops along the coast that offer lessons but I would hold off from calling it ""boogie boarding"". The body boarders I knew hated that term.  You could always get him a decent board and maybe some fins and just head out there. Don't buy a cheap board from Walmart, they will fall apart quick and will give him a gnarly stomach rash.  MOST IMPORTANTLY stay away from shallow breaking beaches. Meaning the waves crash close to shore. It's really easy to dislocate your shoulder or worse going over the top of a wave and landing face first on sand."

orangecounty,39y97n,ScreenPrint,2,Tue Jun 16 08:30:41 2015 UTC,Measure BB couldn't be set up better to invite corruption.    Nearly every concern about dispensaries could have been handled with simple ordinances and codes.  So why not handle it that way in a timely manner instead of letting them grow wildly for years all over town?  1. Doing nothing is always easiest in the short term. 2. Putting it on the ballot just freed politicians from accountability while also creating a system that would line their pockets.  Santa Ana voters were played.

orangecounty,39zyqr,AmboC,2,Tue Jun 16 03:45:08 2015 UTC,Balboa pier... VERY small park right there with about 7 grills.... If going on a weekend you need to send someone at 6 am to snag one...
orangecounty,39zyqr,AliceJoy,0,Tue Jun 16 07:27:53 2015 UTC,"In short, I don't know of any city parks that have what you're looking for that don't have some kind of permit/reservation system. But the permit/reservation system is going to vary city to city.  For a group that large, most city parks and the county parks are going to require a reservation/permit. If you really want to know you could just go city by city on their websites and check their parks pages and/or the local ordinances. Some places don't require a permit, but if a group shows up with a valid permit, you've got to GTFO unless you want the cops called. And that's probably not a situation you want to find yourself in.  County parks are pretty certain to be packed on the weekends. No way you sneak 50 people into a grill/table situation at any of those locations without a permit/reservation.  You might have better luck finding a city park with grills, but you would still have to call ahead the afternoon before and try to swindle someone on the phone into telling you weather or not there are any open reservations there for the next day. I say ""swindle"" because most reservations/permits usually require a week advance notice and purchase, not a half day.  If there's not any reservations, you might be able to sneak in without a reservation/permit. The last thing you want to do is try to set up for an event and create a scene with someone who actually paid for the reservation/permit and leave your group without somewhere to hang out.  If you find somewhere to go but your group is really noticeable/loud or rubs someone the wrong way, someone could always place a call and either the cops or maybe park rangers (if city park rangers work weekends) would come by and check for a reservation/permit. Don't underestimate nosy neighbors or ticked off park patrons.  If you're going to be hosting 50 people and you can't afford that cost on your own, you might want to find someone else to chip in. It's $2 a person for the $100 permits. Someone has to be able to lend a hand. City park reservations should be cheaper."
orangecounty,39zyqr,IAmTheWalkingDead,0,Tue Jun 16 05:15:42 2015 UTC,"Irvine has 2 types of parks--community parks and neighborhood parks. all the community parks require reservation, but they don't allow reservations at any of the neighborhood parks. cypress grove park is great--there are 2 picnic areas there, each with a grill. there's also settler's park, and sweet shade park. all 3 of these are neighborhood parks and you cannot reserve them--they are first come, first serve. i'd suggest getting there no later than 7 am. the irvine city website has a park inventory that lists all of the park amenities."

Then, we noticed that on that day... she could have saved $100, but you need to probably arrive at the time they open and claim a spot."

orangecounty,39vpak,zodar,4,Mon Jun 15 17:37:01 2015 UTC,I can't believe everyone in this thread has no idea what a desert is. Rancho Santa Margarita is definitely not a desert or anything close.

orangecounty,39vpak,gsxdsm,7,Mon Jun 15 10:47:02 2015 UTC,Ah.  So grass grows in Rancho Santa Fe without irrigation?
orangecounty,39vpak,zodar,11,Mon Jun 15 16:02:53 2015 UTC,"We are ""artificially"" running out.  The truth is that we are shipping 80% of our water out of the state in the form of fruits, vegetables, and nuts.  Even if all of the residents stopped all laundry, watering lawns, pools, and showers, and literally only drank water, it wouldn't solve this problem because only about 10% of the water is used for residential urban purposes (i.e. house water).  What you should have said is ""If you move to a desert and run out of water to grow fruits, vegetables, and nuts in that desert, you can't grow fruits, vegetables, and nuts there anymore.""  The farmers have ""water rights"" that are contracts with the state from upwards of 150 years ago.  They are leveraging these rights to continue business as usual throughout the drought.  Make no mistake, residential use of water is not the problem in this manufactured drought.  Just the water usage from almond farmers alone (just almonds) uses slightly more water (11%) than all of the residents in California (~10%) combined."
orangecounty,39vpak,grafxbill,2,Mon Jun 15 16:57:10 2015 UTC,"We are ""artificially"" running out of the water we artificially supply to southern california.  If it wasn't for us milking the Owens Valley, the Colorado, and the Sierras, SoCal couldn't be a thing - grass or no.  And we can talk farms all day long, and their location, but the fact of the matter is that the native plant species are considered ""weeds"" and the species we plant absolutely require artificial augmentation of normal precipitation to survive - even in ""wet"" years.  Even if Ranch Santa Fe isn't desert, it's surrounded by it, and it is not capable in and of itself of surviving year-round on the water that falls only on its land.  Now, I agree with you, that our CA farms waste a lot of water.  But we're arguing two points here and neither invalidates the other."
orangecounty,39vpak,lemon_tea,0,Mon Jun 15 19:30:04 2015 UTC,"If it wasn't for us milking the Owens Valley, the Colorado, and the Sierras, SoCal couldn't be a thing - grass or no.   That's everywhere though.  If you're against moving resources around, then everyone in Manhattan should just die or move out.  Everyone not near natural resources shouldn't have any.  Your argument is ridiculous.  The US really shouldn't exist except for some small counties rich in natural resources.  We have a resource here in SoCal.  It's called real estate.  You move the water to the people and you and the state benefit from having exponentially larger value created from real estate than wherever the water was originally going.  California is the fifth largest economy in the world for a reason."
orangecounty,39vpak,grafxbill,3,Mon Jun 15 21:48:04 2015 UTC,"You're taking my argument to the absurd.  I am refuting your point that SoCal is not desert.  It is.  Plain fact.  Since we must port our water in, and so little of it falls anywhere near local, we need to be much more conservation-minded about it.  Having money doesn't exempt anyone of that.  Water has nothing to do with why we're the 5th largest economy in the world.  You're bringing in unrelated facts to support your farcical argument.  The reason real estate is so valuable is our weather, our geography, and our proximity to well paying and plentiful jobs."
orangecounty,39vpak,lemon_tea,1 point,Mon Jun 15 23:15:22 2015 UTC,Not it is not a desert. How can you guys be so wrong? Have you been to an actual desert as defined by what a desert is?
orangecounty,39vpak,gsxdsm,1 point,Tue Jun 16 02:24:30 2015 UTC,"None of that shit would be here if we didn't port in water to sustain a populace was the point.  There is plentiful water for people to grow (gasp) grass, so your point of conserving water by not growing grass is ridiculous.  The point is that there appears to not be enough water to sustain aggricultural industry.  You're strawmanning the argument by saying:    but the fact of the matter is that the native plant species are considered ""weeds"" and the species we plant absolutely require artificial augmentation of normal precipitation to survive - even in ""wet"" years.   There is more than enough water for any one individual to grow whatever the hell they want.  The water that urbanites actually use is dwarfed by the amount of water used by the aggricultural industry here.  So you bitching about what plants someone grows in the dirt in front of their house is infintesimally small usage of water in the grand scheme of things.  Your argument was about using only   the water that falls only on its land    Which I extrapolated to a larger context.  If we all used only the resources in our surrounding environments, the economy would collapse.  I don't understand why you're so irate about where the water resource comes from.    Also, where did I say that    SoCal is not desert   Pretty sure I didn't say that anywhere.  This is a desert, and I have no problem with moving enough water here so that it doesn't look like a desert.  Even if everyone had dirt lawns or had native plants, it wouldn't make any difference to the water shortage we are facing so why are you getting your panties in a bunch about that?  Bottom line is, do you want to cut aggriculture by 15% and have everyone be able to have as much water as they want?  Or do you want everyone to cut their usage by 90% and still have the same problem we're currently facing?  We all can have native plants in our yards and we'd still be in this same boat so I don't know why that's what you're bringing up."
orangecounty,39vpak,grafxbill,-2,Mon Jun 15 23:59:43 2015 UTC,So the solution is to keep having green lawns?
orangecounty,39vpak,zodar,11,Mon Jun 15 17:00:19 2015 UTC,"Green lawn or not, if the farmers don't cut back it won't matter is my point.  Let's say CA does run out of water in the future.  Hypothetically.  We might run out in August 2017.  The difference between the residents cutting back 100% is that you run out in September 2017.  You might buy 10% more time by having all the residents use no water.    It doesn't make a difference what you do or don't do with water that runs to your house, the outcome is the same.  The solution is to revoke water rights and only farm as much as can be sustained by our climate, until a more grandiose solution is available, i.e. skywater or more desal plants.  Having the residents cut back 100% of their usage doesn't even come close to sustainability so I don't get why you're so adamant about that."
orangecounty,39vpak,grafxbill,1 point,Mon Jun 15 17:17:07 2015 UTC,"I do agree with you about the farms.1 However, I do think we shouldn't just dismiss residential usage. It's one thing to take long showers, or even water small patches a couple of times a week, it's another to water multiple acres of land daily. That's only for aesthetics, and it uses a great deal of water in order to maintain it.  1 Though I think you should probably use cattle rather than almonds as an example. Mature almond trees do grow well in California as long as there isn't a drought. Cattle, on the other hand, uses stupid amounts of water even in good years."
orangecounty,39vpak,briefarm,1 point,Mon Jun 15 20:04:12 2015 UTC,"The lawn argument isn't really focused around people with multiple acres of land.  Those are the 1% getting shit for it, but normal everyday middle class people with small lawns are facing unenforceable fines for using more than their alloted water.    Put it this way, if you were trying to curb carbon emissions, would you focus on legislating how much Prius drivers can drive (urban water users), or the coal plants in the central valley (farmers)?"

orangecounty,39vpak,gsxdsm,3,Mon Jun 15 18:09:31 2015 UTC,"Rancho Santa Fe has a Mediterranean climate. That means it's still pretty dry relatively speaking. It's only a little wetter then a semi-desert climate. It's certainly not enough rainfall to support a large English-style lawn without importing large amounts of water, especially since the rainfall is very uneven and the driest months are in the summer when a lawn needs the most water."

I know what we are trying to say, but the definition of that word I don't think fits. The personal gain part of the definition might fit, but that is a stretch. They are simply just being bad cops, unbecoming of being a police officer."
orangecounty,39icev,meeshkyle,10,Fri Jun 12 15:38:13 2015 UTC,"Actually I would say this is the Epitome of Corruption, ""dishonest or fraudulent conduct by those in power""  These cops are doing nothing more than Serving the Government as they steal from the poor to give to the Cause of More government!   They are not doing the will of the people"
orangecounty,39icev,DEDMON,-4,Fri Jun 12 18:25:43 2015 UTC,"I still don't necessarily see that definition working either. Now, don't get me wrong, what these cops did was definitely wrong, stupid, asshole-ish, and all of those words. But I don't see corruption necessarily.  I don't necessarily see them being dishonest or fraudulent. They aren't going in illegally. They went in there to shut it down because it was not one of the 20 approved dispensaries in Santa Ana.   Corrupt makes me think they went in there to sieze the dope to take it for themselves for their own personal gain. That is how I define corrupt. And the definition I find online says ""having or showing a willingness to act dishonestly in return for money or personal gain."" I don't see these cops necessarily trying to act dishonestly in return for money or personal gain.  It would be corrupt if they took the drugs to sell on their own so they can buy new police vehicles or something for their house or self. What are the officers actually gaining in going in there, making jokes, turning off cameras, taking the DVR, and the other stuff. You might be able to make the argument that the one officer who allegedly ate the edible was corrupt because he ate the edible without paying for it for his own self benefit and gain. But that is all I can see.   Like I said before, I am not saying that what the cops did was right. I just don't necessarily believe the word corrupt is the right word for their actions. I think a different word for their horrible actions is better. I just don't see corruption in their actions realistically by what the definition is."

This is a dispensary, not a crack house. Everyone in that location likely believes they are following the law completely. This is NOT a place where armed and dangerous thugs congregate. It's a bunch of folks who (mistakenly) think they are legally hanging out at a legally authorized dispensary.   ""Hey folks, this dispensary is unlicensed. Please return your products and shop elsewhere"" instead of ""HALT CRIMINAL SCUM!"""

The offer a lot of delivery times and they package everything great, and they just leave it at your door,  no hassle They don't have everything, but they have a lot of stuff available. After the trial ran out I did try vons delivery once. They don't have as many drop off options and as far as I can tell,  they need you to sign for your delivery, which I wasn't stoked on. The price point for Amazon seems high,  but  it includes a prime membership. If you plan to have delivery at least once a week, I think it's pretty even, if not cheaper, to use amazon. Plus they have some restaurants that deliver pre made stuff which is kind of cool  but we didn't try it."

orangecounty,39eyzs,Fist2nuts,-10,Thu Jun 11 15:09:14 2015 UTC,Sorry I didn't know the brownies at the shop had marijuana Captain thought they were just snacks. Pretty sure they are drug tested. Don't think they'd have any more trouble than anyone else in passing one of those. Probably got plenty of clean cop friends willing to contribute some clean urine. Give them a break. So they ate some edibles. Doubt the individual cops doing the raid are the ones who ordered the raid. It was likely done under order of your elected representatives such as the city council or the mayor. Why blame the messenger?

orangecounty,39eyzs,antifret,-4,Thu Jun 11 18:34:42 2015 UTC,"Eh, it's /r/orangecounty downvoting because you don't like someone's opinion is the norm here. Think the raid is the issue. Personally I think they need to sell marijuana in walmart with full legalization (regulated like wine/beer with big corporate players and small craft ones and homebrewers) and get it away from some of these gang types running these dispensaries (not sure the % but a few for sure) and jacking up prices (keeping them at black market levels). However, a good rule is to remember the human and that cops are just following orders and trying to do their job like everyone else. They didn't make marijuana illegal, didn't order the dispensaries in Santa Ana closed (don't think they did correct me if I'm wrong and the cops did this against the wishes of the city council and mayor), and were just having some fun and indulged a little themselves during their job. Guess they probably shouldn't be taking edibles while at work but like someone else said you can blame the unions for that one."

orangecounty,39eyzs,Vanetia,6,Thu Jun 11 23:44:44 2015 UTC,They're not being admonished for raiding the dispensary in this case. They're being admonished for consuming products that they did not pay for (mainly). It's like doing a drug raid and stuffing some of the cash you confiscate in your pocket. Officers aren't allowed to do that.
orangecounty,39eyzs,Fist2nuts,5,Thu Jun 11 17:56:37 2015 UTC,They broke the law by consuming the edibles. As I said before they think they're above the law
orangecounty,39eyzs,CtrlCthenV,3,Thu Jun 11 18:22:38 2015 UTC,Do you know what my issue is with cops when they do this? Its that if I walked into that dispensary and just started eating brownies without asking that would be considered theft. They assumed they could do it because they are in power. I wonder how many times this has occurred while the camera was not pointed at them with other things. Was it $5000 on that last drug raid or was it $4000?

orangecounty,39eyzs,ScreenPrint,8,Thu Jun 11 16:01:55 2015 UTC,"A store across the street from a store?  How is that a problem?

orangecounty,39eyzs,secretreddname,2,Thu Jun 11 19:20:34 2015 UTC,"That is really what everyone I have talked to wants including myself.

orangecounty,39ebfd,TweetsInCommentsBot,1 point,Thu Jun 11 19:05:54 2015 UTC,They won't do an Amber alert unless they think the child is in danger. This case sounds more like a runaway then a kidnapping.

The more marketing you do for you self the better. You can list your house on sites yourself I am pretty sure. Id make sure you get someone to price the house for you if you dont think you can yourself after doing research. Look into similar houses in the area with similar amenities like a pool or renovations and upgrades/additions.

Because of that not only do I extremely despise coyotes but some of these idiot owners don't learn from their past mistakes of letting their animals out even briefly, although they never should at all. Or, they simply don't care which is very heartbreaking. Even in the University Hills housing area next to UCI where it's filled with professors and their families, some of the residents with their Ph.Ds are still ignorant about never allowing letting their cat out as coyotes are even more present in that part of Irvine."

Where are you going to be working (what city at least)? How far are you willing to commute (both in distance and time)? What is your budget for a place to live? Are you looking to keep a 2BR or is a 1BR or Studio an option?   A year ago I moved here from Portland, OR and I had the same situation as you (2BR 1100Sqft at about 1100/Mo), here I have a 1BR 750Sqft apartment costing about 1600/month. I live in a decent area (on the Costa Mesa/Santa Ana Border) but there are definitely nicer areas (and a lot worse areas as well).

I'm going to be able to give a few choices to my regional manager and he'll place me somewhere. I would rather not commute and we were looking to be around 1400-1500/mo rent. 2BR would be preferred but 1BR would do.

I think the smallest homes there are around 3 million though so I'm not sure what range of 'reasonably wealthy' you meant.   A nice neighborhood with good schools is what they're looking for   This is all of Irvine.  Literally.  At this point it's which village they like the best and if they care about a 20 minutes commute (in rush hour) vs. a two minute commute.  Oak Creek, Woodbridge, Woodbury, Portola Springs are probably going to be the closest.  You get more backyard space in woodbridge and oak creek, while the newer communities will be more expensive per sq ft of land.    Laguna Altura is gorgeous, but you're paying for being a bit closer to beach access, Portola Springs is brand new and very nice, but further inland.  Orchard Hills is a brand new neighborhood that's about a ten or fifteen minute drive from ICD/Sand Canyon, but it's going to have nice views up on the hill.  At this point it's just prioritizing distance, backyard size, and 'newness'.  Every place is going to be nice, safe, and have good schools."

Denovo (sp?)/Anti-D  program you get paid around $70 if you have specific antibodies that they are looking for and for the Whole Blood program you get around $200-$500 if you have specific blood rare type.

orangecounty,392urc,tyrano421,7,Mon Jun 8 21:18:59 2015 UTC,"Hey, worst decision i ever made was trusting online reviews of the apartments out here. Even Yelp is unreliable. I moved from NY 10 months ago to the Coronados in Newport Beach. That place is terrible. I did a bunch of research over the past 10 months and found that 3400 avenue of the arts costa mesa is the best place to possibly live (in my opinion). I moved here 3 weeks ago. All young to middle age working professionals, top notch security, beautiful apartments. www.live3400.com  right across from the south coast plaza, and near the 405 Freeway, Macarthur blvd, and the 55 freeway to get where you need to go!"
orangecounty,392urc,SCBradley1,6,Mon Jun 8 23:59:53 2015 UTC,I just moved in here also. Best place hands down.
orangecounty,392urc,masturjason,3,Tue Jun 9 00:42:20 2015 UTC,"But, to be honest, nothing in the way of nightlife there."
orangecounty,392urc,tossy_mctosserson,1 point,Tue Jun 9 00:07:53 2015 UTC,"I don't know how others feel about this, but i think living in a beautiful place trumps being close to the bars. Especially when you have Uber which totally mitigates that factor. I saved $300 a month by moving from the beach / bar / nightlife scene, to 3400 Avenue of The Arts. I still go to all of the same bars and probably spend about $80-100 in Uber fares a month. Still $200 profit."
orangecounty,392urc,SCBradley1,6,Mon Jul 6 21:56:43 2015 UTC,"I know people who lived in the Newport Bluffs that have had good experiences.  It's on the corner of Jamboree and McArthur pretty much.  It's a cheap Uber to the Newport Peninsula, which is where most of your nightlife will be in that area.  It's not too far from Costa Mesa (17th St.) which will have some nightlife as well.  It's also 20 minutes to Laguna down PCH."
orangecounty,392urc,Phatferd,2,Mon Jun 8 21:49:04 2015 UTC,"I just moved out of Newport Bluffs. It's really nice, but the demographic is more families and divorcees (at least in the townhomes). They have really cool events here, most notably the holiday pool parties."
orangecounty,392urc,masturjason,7,Tue Jun 9 00:44:28 2015 UTC,"We have a thing here called ""corporate"" apartments or even a Residence Inn.  Why not pay the monthly rate there for a month and explore, then select a place vs. plunking down on a year lease up front?"
orangecounty,392urc,tossy_mctosserson,1 point,Tue Jun 9 00:08:33 2015 UTC,This is your answer. Better safe then sorry.
orangecounty,392urc,pipboylover,4,Tue Jun 9 08:45:31 2015 UTC,"Take apartment reviews online with a grain of salt... almost no one writes them unless they had a bad experience.  Most of the time, the experience wasn't the fault of the building or management company, but an annoying neighbor or ridiculous expectations.    I was moving into an apartment complex in Newport Beach about five years ago, and just about every review I could find (most sites had them in the 20% range in terms of score) basically said it was a shitbox with shitty management, and even worse neighbors.  That couldn't be further from the truth.  It's a nice apartment with great management and the occasional too-drunk neighbor.  It's no paradise, but it's still a great place to live."
orangecounty,392urc,JTRoberts,4,Mon Jun 8 23:49:40 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the great suggestions everyone! And you're right, apartment reviews do go both ways.  By nightlife I just mean restaurants and bars nearby to have social dinner and drinks, not partying/clubbing moreso!"
orangecounty,392urc,MrCelloBoiz,6,Tue Jun 9 00:30:31 2015 UTC,"Park Newport. I'm not sure how much rent normally is for a 2 bedroom but I'm paying $2,050 which is a steal. I was originally paying $1,800 as part of a summer promotion that they were running and although the increase after our lease ended was pretty steep for us, I gotta say it's well worth it. No other apartment complex I know of offers the level of amenities this place has for the price. Considering you work down MacArthur, this location is ideal for you. Your commute would probably be about 5 minutes"
orangecounty,392urc,modernmemo,1 point,Tue Jun 9 02:06:16 2015 UTC,Exactly what I was going to say! Plus you're super close to fashion island where there are plenty of nice places to go for dinner and drinks.

orangecounty,392urc,superbread,3,Tue Jun 9 00:04:49 2015 UTC,"$2,500 for a 1 bedroom is definitely on the high end. I've rented a corner unit 3 bedroom 2.5 bath, 2 story condo with 2 car garage for $2,200 in Mission Viejo.   For $2k+ you're looking at a 2 bedroom or more at the very least, regardless of what area you're looking at. Newport Beach included.  Not cheap of course, but still not $2.5k for a 1 br."
orangecounty,392urc,grafxbill,1 point,Tue Jun 9 04:08:38 2015 UTC,"What do you mean by nightlife?  Like early 20's clubbing/drinking nightlife?  Or $100 dinner dates and martinis nightlife?  If you want to spend that much, I'd just rent a house.  No sense in paying that much for 800-1000 sqft of space.  You're just asking to get ripped off.  The only apartment complex I saw with a 1 BDRM that high is going to be Promontory Point or Los Olivos townhome.  Both of which are a rip off.  I'd go on Zillow and Trulia looking to rent someone's house.  Also try Condosetc.com they've helped me out before and seem to have listings that others don't have."
orangecounty,392urc,jfbruin,1 point,Tue Jun 9 00:07:06 2015 UTC,"Check out the new Irvine Company complex, the Park Place Apartments. Tons of restaurants nearby. Super close to your work and not far from the beach. These just recently opened too, so you may still be able to get one of their intro deals. They initially gave away TVs and 2 months of free rent for a 12 month deal."
orangecounty,392urc,Terefel,1 point,Tue Jun 9 01:15:49 2015 UTC,"If you want to live near the peninsula but above the fray, look at the area around Hoag hospital using Craigslist or padmapper. These are primarily condos so you won't find them on rent.com or whatever. Villa Balboa or the Versailles should have stuff in your price range and it's a cool area that's walkable to the beach and a park and bars etc (albeit you have to go uphill to come back or pay 6 bucks for a can ride). I did a lot of research around this area when my girlfriend moved into the area and I highly recommend.   Regardless of what you do, don't get discouraged. It's hard to move to the beach in the summer so you may need to give it some time."
orangecounty,392urc,Terefel,1 point,Tue Jun 9 02:10:44 2015 UTC,"That's a great suggestion! Would you recommend that I look on padmapper closer to the anticipated date of my move (which is anticipated in first week of August)? I suppose padmapper/craigslist listings have move-in dates which are closer to ""today"" than not?"
orangecounty,392urc,throwAwayObama,1 point,Tue Jun 9 02:35:12 2015 UTC,"Happy to help! I would think your prime time will be the end of June to beginning of July because they tend to advertise a month in advance, but it cant hurt to start looking now to see what's out there and if it fits your desired goals. When my girlfriend and I were looking we used the Craigslist map view and we looked every day for places on the peninsula, next to Hoag, on Balboa and in CDM.  Most of the places we liked ended up being around Hoag but it was very competitive at the time (right before the college kids came back, so similar timing to you) and she ended up in an awesome place on the peninsula instead.  The key is to remain proactive in your search and be wary of scams (e.g., don't send payment without seeing a place, as common sense as it sounds.)  It seems like a lot of work, and it is, but it will payoff in the long run when you end up in a place that's in the right neighborhood and is comfortable enough to call home.  Feel free to message me if you need any more help, because just a few blocks can make all the difference and we saw a lot of frogs before we found the one."

(I'm a bot)     While other cities across America, including West Coast cities like Seattle, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Long Beach and San Diego have been adopting ordinances raising their local minimum wage - climbing toward a $15 per hour minimum wage by 2020 - Irvine is apparently America's only major city headed in the other direction, actually cutting its minimum wage by more than 20%. Councilmember Christina Shea and Mayor Steven Choi have been leading the effort to repeal Irvine's ""Living Wage"" law - now set at a minimum of about $11 per hour.  In supporting Shea's repeal proposal, Mayor Steven Choi invoked a confused analysis that suggested Irvine was somehow ""Subsidizing"" other cities in Orange County by prescribing a wage that was higher than the state minimum wage of $9 per hour.  He dismissed the Irvine Living Wage as what he repeatedly termed a ""Feel-good wage.""

orangecounty,38tyqu,tofucabin,8,Sat Jun 6 20:16:22 2015 UTC,"We often take ours out in Newport Harbor/Back Bay. The easiest launch spot is at Newport Aquatic Center (1 Whitecliffs Dr, Newport Beach, CA 92660). Has ample parking and a real easy beach to launch it from.   There's another good launch spot on Balboa Peninsula, I believe it's at J Street though I would have to google it to make sure.   For a change of pace you can launch from Mother's Beach down in Dana Point and cruise around the harbor there. It's much smaller than Back Bay but pretty nice.   My late grandpa owned a house up in Crestline/Lake Gregory in the San Bernardino Mountains and we take it up to Lake Gregory a bunch. It costs something like $8 to launch but makes for some fun fishing. I'm sure there are closer lakes which will also allow you to launch but I haven't tried any of them.   If you're looking for rivers I can't really help you but would love to hear any other suggestions!"

Make reservations ahead of time, though, like a week in advance at least if you want to eat at a decent hour.   Also while you're in the area, explore 4th Street market directly across the street from playground, it's full of some more great places to eat. The owner of the playground opened it and rented out the spaces to other chefs, some from popular gourmet food trucks in the LA/OC area so now they have a brick and mortar location - try out Dos Chinos Latin Korean fusion in there, their burritos are awesome."

The corner of Hazard and Harbor. Neighbourhood looks skeevy, but it's fine, I promise), Sparks (the patio has a really nice view and it's never as crowded as Fed's and Duke's is way over rated,) 25 degrees, The Sugar Shack, Porky's Pizza (no dine in, carry out and delivery only,) Tandoori Garden, Kung Pao Bowl, Fantastic Burger, Norms (the one in Huntington on Beach, not the one in Santa Ana on 17th), and I think I'm spent.   All of them can be found on yelp for addresses/directions/whatever. Maybe half of them are chains? Cuisine is all over the place, from taco closets to all you can eat Argentinian BBQ. (three bucks a head to fifty bucks a plate plus drinks.) I would have included a Peruvian place but the one I used to go to closed and I've not tried the one near my house yet. Most of these places are low wait times. Cham Sut Gol is always a wait but it's all you can eat korean BBQ and it's good, so yea... And The House of Shabu Shabu can be a wait, but again, all you can eat (including lamb! I love lamb.) they tend to slice stuff pretty thin but ayce what do you expect? An alternative shabu place is Sakura in Huntington, not ayce, but the portions are large, the cuts are good, and the staff are competent. I'd still suggest ayce for shabu if you've never had it though, that way you can try a little of everything."

Boiling crab is great, still my favorite cajun seafood joint.   KBBQ - Mr. BBQ in Fullerton. Get the beef belly. Or you can try Japanese bbq @Tsuruhashi  Steak houses - The Ranch has one of the best prime ribs I've ever had. Can't say much for their Saloon part of the restaurant. Most of the bad reviews are for their Saloon so don't let that deter you.   Downtown Santa Ana has great food and so does Anaheim Packing House.

orangecounty,38k6np,nairys,5,Thu Jun 4 19:27:43 2015 UTC,Two things to take into consideration.  The noise of the freeway and the dirt that it gives off.  I live off of murilands and la paz (behind the Albertsons that is now a Hagen).  My parents have also lived here for 29 years.  They just sold their house june 1st and are moving out of state.  They said the one thing everyone complained about when looking at the house was the freeway noise.
orangecounty,38k6np,ToadGamaken,3,Thu Jun 4 21:21:28 2015 UTC,The funny thing about freeway noise or any persistent noise is that after a while you dont notice it anymore.

The noise is something we're okay with but didn't think about the dust. We had our home inspection today and we decided to talk to a few of the neighbors. Fortunately, everyone seemed okay with the noise. We could barely hear any noise out in the front yard. The neighbors also said an engineering firm came out to do a survey for the project last week and the contractors said they were going to recommend against moving forward with the project. Unfortunately, it's impossible to guess how things will play out."

Found them on Yelp and bought a standard Sony CD player stereo w/ aux jack. Was about $120 installed..they knocked it right out in about 30 minutes. A few months later I started blowing a fuse. I took it back to have them check if any wires were loose or something like that. They looked at it right away. The tech comes back a few minutes later and says he found the problem and hands me a dime. I dropped a coin in the cigarette lighter port in my center console and that was making it blow the fuse. I asked them how much I owed for the diagnosis and they said no charge. I offered a ten spot to buy them a beer after work and they refused and just asked me to refer people to them. So here I am..

orangecounty,38bn6z,Me_for_President,3,Wed Jun 3 07:02:14 2015 UTC,"The hike to the summit of Mt. Baldy (Mt. San Antonio) is interesting. It's mostly covered until you get to the end at about 9,800 or so feet, at which point you're above the tree line and it gets an otherwordly feel to it.  There's some really amazing views, particularly once you get to the Devil's Backbone portion of the trail.  If you go on a Saturday, the lodge at the notch will have live music and a great BBQ that is awesome after the hike.   My preferred way to do it is to take the ski lift to the notch and then do the ~6.6 mile RT hike to the summit from there, possibly adding the 2-mile fire road down to the parking lot if you're feeling up to it. Some people hike up the fire road, but the lift is so pleasant it feels like a crime not to take it up.   The 3+ mile hike in has about 2,400 feet in elevation gain, and it gets really steep as you hit the last leg to the summit. It'll definitely put your legs to the test. That said, it really is an incredible hike. Summiting around sunset is amazing."

orangecounty,388gkg,FawkesFire13,6,Tue Jun 2 16:22:44 2015 UTC,Check out the Promenade at Anaheim/Doria Lofts/Broadway Arms complex in the heart of downtown Anaheim near City Hall and Packing House. I live there and see a TON of Disneyland people here. I asked a few of them and apparently Disney hooked them up with the place pulling the rent out of their check. I am not sure how that works - if Disney pays a portion? - but you may want to look into it.  I really like it here. Excellent walk score with lots of cool little bars restaurants and shops within easy walking distance. Feel free to PM with any questions.

orangecounty,388gkg,WorkinGreen,1 point,Wed Jun 3 16:26:00 2015 UTC,It's the college work experience program. The cast members you see living there are part of it and from out of state colleges. The rent is the same but it gets split between 3 to 4 people....pulled directly from their paychecks.

If you are the type of person that get nervous talking to people you don't know, you can sit down and hangout for a bit. Someone will come to you and ask if you want to join a game. It's pretty easy going. The rules of the games are usually explained at the beginning. So you don't have to worry about not knowing how to play. You might not get it the first time, but you get better as you go. Just go and have fun."

orangecounty,381mnn,HugsAllCats,3,Mon Jun 1 05:01:33 2015 UTC,"Short answer is no. If all cops did was pull people for no front plates and tints, they wouldn't have time do focus on anything else LOL.  I have 35% on my front driver/ passenger and no front plates as well. Had my car for over a year now and never been bothered about either by cops. I even got a ticket all the way up in Arcadia for running a stop sign and they didn't mention my no front plates or tints... but I did get a $300+ ticket for a California roll. However my friend has 15% and got pulled over at night before in HB. They said his trunk light was blue and also warned him about his dark tints. Another friend of mines got pulled over in Orange by the Block for Limo tint on his Prius. He just got a fix it ticket. Honestly you wouldn't get pulled over unless you have limo or 15-20%. And chances are you will get pulled over late at night because it gives cops an excuse to check for DUI's. Also if you get pulled over for other violations such as speeding, texting driving etc they can add those tint/ no front plate as additional tickets."
orangecounty,381mnn,M5BMW,2,Mon Jun 1 09:17:34 2015 UTC,I got pulled over on my way home from Tahoe after not having any problems for years in SoCal. You CAN get pulled over and they will make you take it off but most tint places will take it off for free if you get them done there.

Super light or 'normal any other state dark' (all the other sunny states are like 25-35% transmission)  Oh man, front license plate is going to be a bitch.  Due to my front bumper's winch and d-ring points, I had to cut notches in to my front plate to puzzle-piece is in. And then I had to use bolts & nuts through the steel bumper to hold it in place. Holding the nuts in position required nearly a half-hour of contortion and an array of tape, magnetic pick-up tools, and long nosed pliers. I'm not looking forward to removing my current plate or trying to install a new one when I get down there."

You can also just roll down the windows if you see a cop nearby if you're that frightened of the ticket.  I also have no front plate and have never had any issues.  Don't drive like an ass and you'll be fine.    Also most tint places offer a ""fix it ticket"" insurance, they will remove the tint, allow you to pass the inspection and then replace it afterwards."

So, here's some spots you might want to check:  Corona Del Mar.  Try the restaurants at Fashion Island, 3Thirty3 on Fridays and Saturdays, Xavier's Newport Coast, and Las Brisa in Laguna Beach.  I think you'll find like minded mature people like yourself.  Ultimately though - if you think ""maturity"" means ""LOOK HOW AWESOME I AM!"" I think you're gonna have a bad time.  I know when you're 21 it feels good to have a decent job and drive a convertible and cook your own food, but while those are traits of a grown-up, crowing about them on social-media does not appeal to actual adults, although it will impress other 21 year olds, who think maturity is vomiting in the toilet rather than the gutter.  Frankly, you seem like an OK kid.  And there's nothing wrong with being driven and successful, in spite of what Reddit may think.  But your approach here is all wrong.  As a side note - I find it fascinating how deeply invested in shameless self-promotion millennials are.  It's this weird contrast between ""LOOK AT ME/I'M SO ALONE""."

I would suggest going to Newport Beach on weekends - a lot of recent college graduates move there afterwards and go out to the bars. I would also suggest playing recreational sports if you have any inkling to do so. Great way to not only be active, but also meet like-minded people. They have beach flag football leagues or pick up basketball, etc. Just look around for what peaks your interest.   If you are interested in music, the Observatory has all sorts of genres of artists coming through on a daily basis - this could be a good option to go meet people.  LA is also much closer than you think and there are always great events going on that could bring you together with like-minded folk.    It is obviously very tough to move to a new place so congratulations on making the leap - keep trying to connect with others and getting out."

Right now, it's just a question that has been posed on a Disney Survey, but they are thinking about making the base ticket price cheaper (like 100 dollars) and adding an extra $5 for weekends OR $15 for holiday weekdays/weekends. It's a way for Disney to try and even out attendance on days that are normally slow (by making them more busy) and try to lessen the traffic for the holidays and weekends.

(When I tried to transfer it from Arizona into Oregon, they wanted to charge me $150 just to take the test, which they told me was very difficult, and since I didn't have a bike I gave up my M1, which was a mistake.)  I was able to simply transfer the M1 without retesting in the first instance, which should be your case.   In the second, I had to retake the written test, and take the two day safety class instead of doing the road test.  Honestly, I didn't mind the retesting. It's amazing what I had forgotten that I learned when studying. I would recommend the safety class regardless of how many years you have been riding. It's different here, for one. For another, the more I know, the safer I am.   Last point: Because of budget cuts the CA DMVs that are still open are very crowded and slow. Even with an appointment it took me two visits of almost four hours each transferring title and registration, and getting my M1.

First of all, you can't change your information on Covered CA anymore once medical gets a hold of your case. Calling CC would be useless because MediCal has more power. What you need to keep doing (and that you've been doing) is to continue to call your caseworker, the info you can find on your letters. Since you said that doesn't work, go to the nearest MediCal office and seek immediate help, ask them to release your case and say that you no longer need MediCal because you have coverage from work.   Next step is to update your wage information on covered ca and that you need to do extra paperwork to declare that you are opting it of covered ca because you have coverage from work.   All these needs to be done because you don't want to get fucked over when you file for taxes next year. Don't want you to get audited especially if they find discrepancies. Oh make sure you keep records of every interaction and conversation complete with name and dates. We had a client who called out medical on their mistakes and medical apologized to them.   Hope that helps and sorry about phone shitty format. Let me know if you have any questions"

They auto enrolled you because you didn't chose a plan.   However now that you have benefits through your employer you should be unenrolled with Medicaid. Sometimes it just takes them a while to update their records. You should be auto unenrolled.   You can try calling HealthCare Options, 800-430-4263 and update your info with them. Another option would be to go down to the local Medicaid office and update there.   If you want when I go into work tomorrow I can check your eligibility on the medical website to see if they updated anything.

Prices are significantly lower than Carmax, but you're buying an ex-rental, which worries some people. I had the car taken to my mechanic for a pre-purchase inspection and he said it was in great shape, so I went with it. All of Hertz's cars comes with a 12 month 12,000 mile warranty.

orangecounty,379vwh,antifret,1 point,Tue May 26 18:37:45 2015 UTC,"Hmm, Public Motors worked out well for me. Read some reviews on the internet. They're horrible. They do this fake auction thing where you're ready to buy a car. Agreed to pay listed price or agreed to a lower price and they're saying stupid stuff like ""Bids are coming in now online."" when they're just making stuff up and no real auction works that way (where you can't see others bidding but take the salesman's word for it). But the prices are much lower than carmax and you're not driving a former rental. Also the 10 year old car I bought blew up (probably because I was pushing the rpms) and they replaced the engine under warranty. They offer a 3 month warranty for all the used cars they sell. This is not extra but included in the already lowered price of the car. So they're pretty annoying and shady but offer a warranty when others do not and are cheaper in general."

Since you'll be 20 minutes max from the beach, I think you should definitely visit both Huntington Beach and Newport Beach.  Huntington has a main street filled with restaurants and bars and the pier.  If you go in the afternoon you can spend the day at the beach, and/or walking the pier, and whatnot, and at night grab anything from Sushi to Tacos or whatnot.  Some very lively pubs along with some more upscale places, all walking distance.  Huntington Beach Main Street Info  One of my favorite restaurants is on main street, it's called ""25 Degrees"".  It's a 'fancy' burger places.  Very upscale looking, full bar, dimly lit (great date place) and you can get an excellent hamburger for $12.   Newport Beach is great too, on one side you have balboa where the younger folks hang out, tons of bars, you can tour the harbor, etc.  I definitely recommend a harbor cruise, lot of fun and relaxing if the weather is nice: Cheap boating in Newport Harbor  Further south you have one of the fanciest plots of real estate in the country.  Go eat dinner or have drinks at Pelican Hill resort to get a feel for it.  Get a feel for the 'newport life' at pelican They have a few different restaurants open to anyone of various price ranges."

Like the other poster said, the Orange County Zoo at Irvine Regional Park is pretty small, but has a decent number of native rescued wild life. They're both worth checking out if you have the time. And they're both relatively inexpensive. There's also the LA Zoo up in LA, and the world famous San Diego Zoo and San Diego Zoo Safari Park in San Diego and Escondido, respectively.  The hiking trails at Irvine Regional Park are not very intense. Most of the park is very suburban with green grass and a couple of fake lakes. There are nearby regional parks that are next to or connect to Irvine Regional Park where you could get more of an outdoorsy hike going if you wanted to. I like them just fine for short hikes, but they're all bordering housing developments for the most part.

They would pay these contractors $13.34 instead the usual minimum wage of $10.82.  The article wanders in a few different directions from ""what is a livable wage for those in Irvine?"" and what effects has this had on the city.  For the latter subject, it cites the Orange County great park for its reported mismanagement. The city has in turn stated that companies have been hard to come by because they do not want to comply with these mandatory minimums, and the companies left over know they can charge absorbent costs because there is not that much competition.

orangecounty,37513m,SSSS_car_go,5,Mon May 25 00:30:46 2015 UTC,"If you're taking the Starlight and the bus from Oakland or Emeryville into San Francisco, it's about 30-45 minutes as I recall. Alternatively, there are bus connections from Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo or you can take a bus connection from Los Angeles to Bakersfield and take the San Joaquin train to the Bay Area (with that same 30-45 minute final connection)."
orangecounty,37513m,omgsean1982,2,Mon May 25 01:58:35 2015 UTC,"It depends on which train you take, but it looks like one, two, or three connections. I don't really understand the schedules."
orangecounty,37513m,IAmTheWalkingDead,4,Mon May 25 03:29:23 2015 UTC,"Make sure you're buying:   OC --> Union Station (LA) (Pac Surfliner) Change trains in DTLA LAX --> Oakland, CA - Jack London Square (OKJ) (Coast Starlight)  Don't get on a bus in SLO, Fresno, Bakersfield or anywhere else.   Coast Starlight is one of the most amazing, beautiful trips ever. The bus - not so much"
orangecounty,37513m,IAmTheWalkingDead,3,Mon May 25 16:51:14 2015 UTC,"Alternatively you could do:   Metrolink in OC --> Union Station LA Union Station (LA) --> San Jose [for the Coast Starlight route; Only seems to depart once a day at 10:10 AM going north; Arrive 8:11 PM] San Jose --> San Francisco via CalTrain, which should take approximately 90 minutes on the regular trains (which is all that I think runs that late) Then Uber, cab or MUNI Bus from San Francisco Station to Final Destination.   Assuming all the trains are running on time, that gets you to SF Station by 10 to 10:40 PM depending on if it's a weekday or weekend.  I wouldn't think you miss much of a view after sunset going up the East Bay to Oakland on the Coast Starlight. Plus then in Oakland you still have to go across the bridge or take BART into SF, then probably another form of transport to your final destination in the city. Coast Starlight gets you into Oakland at 9:24 PM. Chances are you probably wouldn't make it into San Francisco on BART until 10ish.  So if it's a weekday it's essentially the same amount of time, again, assuming no delays, to go to either San Jose or Oakland then to San Francisco. If it's a weekend, then Oakland has a 40 minute time advantage. But San Jose and CalTrain have a ""at least it's not BART"" advantage.  Cost-wise I don't know what the difference is for Coast Starlight to Oakland + BART versus Coast Starlight to San Jose + CalTrain. I would guess it can't be much of a difference either way."
orangecounty,37513m,SSSS_car_go,1 point,Tue May 26 08:05:55 2015 UTC,Does this work in reverse? I was now thinking of flying up and taking the train on the way back?
orangecounty,37513m,omgsean1982,1 point,Thu May 28 18:21:25 2015 UTC,"It should work.  The Coast Starlight departs from Oakland at 8:50 AM and from San Jose at 10:07 AM, arriving in Los Angeles at 9:00 PM. You'd have to look up the BART or CalTrain Southbound schedules to see what time you would need to get on either of those in San Francisco to make it to either Oakland or San Jose by the above departure times.  However, getting from Union Station in LA back to OC by Metrolink is going to be problematic I think, since I don't think Metrolink runs late enough. You would probably have to look into taking the Amtrak Pacific Surfliner from Union Station into Orange County.  You'll just have to look at the Amtrak, Metrolink, BART and CalTrain schedules to see if you can piece together a route and timetable that works, and allow time for small delays. (Big delays might really screw you over.)  The train might sound like fun, but if you can get airline tickets cheap enough (usually Southwest is cheap if you book in advance), I would personally do that. Are you really going to stare out the window for 12 hours on the train? Airports are a small hassle but I'd take that 90ish minute flight any day of the week if I could afford it compared to driving or spending 12 hours on a train. And I might guess that taking three different rail systems is also going to cost you close to what an early booked airline ticket will cost, plus time costs."

orangecounty,37513m,Prequalified,2,Mon May 25 17:51:45 2015 UTC,I jumped thru the ticket booker at http://amtrak.com and was able to get a ticket from LAX to OKJ tomorrow at 10:11am (arrives OKJ at 8:30pm). Ticket to LAX from San Juan Capistrano or Laguna Niguel is easy enough to get you into DTLA before 10am. San Jose is another option too. There may actually be BART access there also?

orangecounty,370183,IAmTheWalkingDead,1 point,Mon May 25 14:33:02 2015 UTC,"Many of the cities are named after the families that originally owned the land. A high school friend was great-grandson to the Linda family (of Yorba Linda (orchard of linda)). The family was broke and the direct (named) grandchildren only owned the original mansion.   That doesn't sound correct at all.  In 1834, Jose Antonio Yorba's most successful son, Bernardo Yorba (after whom the city would later be named), was granted the 13,328-acre (53.94 km2) Rancho Cañón de Santa Ana by Mexican governor José Figueroa. Most of this original land was retained after the Mexican American war in 1848 by descendants of the Yorba family. A portion of the city's land is still owned and developed by descendants of Samuel Kraemer, who acquired it through his marriage to Angelina Yorba, the great-granddaughter of Bernardo Yorba. The site of the Bernardo Yorba Hacienda, referred to as the Don Bernardo Yorba Ranch House Site, is listed as a California Historical Landmark.  After the death of Bernardo Yorba in 1858, the Indian servants left and the hacienda went into a slow decline as property and land was divided among the Yorba heirs. In 1926 the property's owner, Samuel Kraemer, demolished the building to prevent further vandalism. The Yorba Cemetery is the only surviving part of the Yorba Hacienda. The cemetery was deeded to the county of Orange in 1967 and is presently administered by the county parks department.  You may have known a guy from a Linda Family that went broke and had a fancy mansion in the area that went to crap, but it doesn't sound like it has anything to do with the history of Yorba Linda.  I've never heard any stories about Samuel Kraemer or his descendants going broke, especially since Kraemer found oil on his property and got even richer off of that. I've also never heard of any Yorba descendants keeping wealth then losing it drastically. Much like Kraemer married one of Jose Antonio Yorba's great-granddaughters, two of the Rowland family sons, John and Thomas, would marry two of Jose Antonio Yorba's granddaughters. The Rowlands are who Rowland Heights is named after, and the descendants are very rich to this day thanks to the oil in the Brea-Olinda Oil Field and their commercial property holdings."

I have always been recommended python whenever I ask for advice too. (Not saying I either is better just mentioning it :P) i actually plan to enter a career in Law Enforcement, although I align most with CS and plan on getting a BA in it. Done with Gen Ed (mostly) so I'll be doing math, geology, and an entry level CS course next semester. Not sure what I'll do (or would do) with a CS degree in LE, but hey... I'm not a psychologist, nor do I find business degrees a good decision. And a degree in LE is a risk if you get denied.  Kinda ranting haha. But yeah man! Seems like a lot of monry is in CS. I presume it takes a lot of work especially learning on your own time outside of school and building a resume that isn't just a BA right?"

I'm 3 years into my career (currently in an Associate Software Engineer role) with a B.S. and I make 75k + bonuses.   Average in OC for a SWE is about 85k but you have to consider the fact that that includes a wide range of experience and education levels.   With your background I'd say 70-75k is a solid offer, I could also see 60k being something an employer could start at given your experience but you can probably negotiate up a bit.   Six figures in my opinion is not ambitious, it's out of the question given your background (not trying to be rude but given that you don't have a degree and you have less than a year full time experience it's really not something I'd expect but if you can get it then hats off to you)."

orangecounty,36p5v8,Kitteas,12,Thu May 21 01:26:39 2015 UTC,"I've helped run the Global Reddit Meetup Day for the past 3 years. Unfortunately, summer commitments are going to prevent us from setting it up. We are, however, willing to impart some institutional knowledge.  Ideal Venue Characteristics:  -One that can hold at least 40-50 people. I would say that we've had about 100 people attend (at the most), but most people come and go throughout the day.  -One that won't necessitate a mandatory fee for all attendees involved  -Not impossible parking  -A place that can accommodate an array of activities (outdoor games, usually)  Hence why parks tend to be the more popular GRMD venue. Please note that it costs money to reserve OC Parks shelters (plus advance notice - book now if you can). We've also toyed with the idea of having a bounce house or inflatable games - OC Parks require a permit for this and you can only use their bounce house vendors.  Impractical Venue Suggestions That We Got Every Year   1) The beach - everyone inevitably wants to have a bonfire and to get one on a Saturday during the summer, you need someone willing to get there early (as in 5-6am) to stake out a spot and wait until everyone arrives. Cooking capabilities to feed everyone are limited without a fire. Parking is also an issue.  2) A bar - depending on the place, you're automatically excluding under-21 Redditors, which is pretty shitty.  What Organizers Need to Keep in Mind to Provide the Day of  -Utensils (plates, cups, napkins, folks, spoons)  -Trash bags  -Water bottles  -Signs (to direct people to your spot)  -At least one substantial food item (not chips, candy, cookies. You're talking like a sandwich tray or fried rice)  -Name tags & sharpies [not mandatory, but helpful]  -Be willing to give out your phone number to help people that are lost.   Take Responsibility  Organizers need to take responsibility for attendees. Unfortunately, this includes policing behavior. We've had issues with open alcohol containers in places we weren't supposed to have alcohol to people bringing weapons -_- Have fun, just be sure to be vigilant of things like this that happen."
orangecounty,36p5v8,peppermintoreo,3,Fri May 22 20:50:22 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't call the beach impractical. We did it a few years back and everyone had a lot of fun (except for the people whose cars were still parked at 10:01 and got a ticket...). For a bonfire, yes, we'd need someone with the morning to kill. But if we could just bring our own little grills that wouldn't even be an issue."
orangecounty,36p5v8,Vanetia,4,Fri May 22 22:55:17 2015 UTC,"Yes. I was the one who staked out the spot and was there all day long.  I challenge you to find someone who wants to do that.   And yes, people can bring grills. However, when it comes to organizing these things, if the event needs it, organizers need to be able to provide it themselves. Folks who have grills may not be able to stay the whole time. Or worse, you have 30 hungry people with things to cook and the damn grill doesn't show up until late in the day... Not ideal."
orangecounty,36p5v8,peppermintoreo,5,Fri May 22 23:54:26 2015 UTC,"I live about 2 miles from the beach near Newland, which is prime real estate on the beach bonfires. I could pull it off, you don't need to be there at 6am, more like 10. I'd be willing to do it if someone brings me some dank beer or something."
orangecounty,36p5v8,snarky_answer,3,Sat May 23 04:45:17 2015 UTC,People brought weapons? I could understand someone who has a license to conceal but since you guys knew about the weapon I'm gonna just guess and say it wasn't that.

We're fine with people owning/possessing weapons, but GRMD is not the place to have them. The last thing we want is someone getting accidentally hurt."
orangecounty,36p5v8,snarky_answer,4,Mon May 25 10:03:08 2015 UTC,Well especially since that weapon is pretty illegal to have

orangecounty,36p5v8,TBatWork,7,Sun May 31 20:54:40 2015 UTC,"I recommend any sort of potluck style park/beach meet, or any business that's a restaurant first.   Bars limit attendance to people who are 21 and over. Breweries tend to be fine in that regard, though picking one that serves food or has options in the area would be preferable. Avoiding places with an admission, cover fee or any other barrier to entry helps too.   We've done park and beach potlucks for previous years and they've worked out very well. Parks may have a reservation or license fee, and we can paypal money for any fees. /u/bananabelle set up an indigogo/gofundme/whatever that was in previous years, with any extra money going to charity after the reservation fees had been paid."

This weekend is the opening of the Disneyland Resort 60th Anniversary celebration, so there's sure to be some serious crowds.   The days that the annual passes are blocked out are the days that the parks are busy and you probably don't want to deal with the crowds anyway. So if your schedule is usually on the weekdays anyway to avoid crowds, do a cheaper SoCal Select annual pass. If the only time you have to go are on holidays and weekends, then go for the deluxe and premium passes. Bear in mind that free parking only comes with the premium pass."

That being said, I'd take an annual pass for Disney over one for Knott's. You can enjoy all the rides you like in Knott's over a few visits, but Disney's atmosphere and experience is something that (for me) takes a lot longer to get old."
orangecounty,36nt80,plastikmissile,2,Wed May 20 19:38:38 2015 UTC,"I really enjoy California Adventure. The rides and boardwalk feel are really pleasant. I have never been to Knott's before, is it kinda like that or no?"
orangecounty,36nt80,Slugzz21,3,Wed May 20 22:14:18 2015 UTC,"For thrill rides I like Knotts a whole lot more. But for atmosphere you can't beat Disney. The Cowboy theme of Knotts is nice (miles better than Six Flags) but Disney does the ""theme"" part better."
orangecounty,36nt80,Shatteredreality,1 point,Wed May 20 23:27:03 2015 UTC,Not at all. I'd really compare it to a step above like the oc fair? but waay cleaner. Then again I am extremely biased soo...
orangecounty,36nt80,karma_nder,6,Thu May 21 04:57:47 2015 UTC,"I can't speak to the value of the Knott's pass but I think the Disney pass is well worth it.  We are pretty new to SoCal so having a Disney pass helps us when we have friends come down. A lot of the time they want to do Disney and we could not afford to go that often buying single day passes.   I do feel that comparing the two is like comparing apples and oranges in a way though.   A Knott's pass is $86-200 Dollars (86 for Knott's Berry farm, $100 for Knott's Berry + Soak City, $200 for All Cedar Fair parks (the next closest is in the Bay Area) and includes parking) in contrast a single day at Disney is 99-155 (depending on if you get a park hopper) and that does not include parking (17/day for Disney, 15/day for Knott's).  In short you can get an annual pass for every Cedar Fair park in the US (plus free parking every time you visit) for $28 more than a single day at Disney (Park Hopper) with parking.   Disney APs start at $300 (assuming you are a SoCal Resident) and go up to $800, only the $800 pass includes parking.  I think it's really hard to compare them since there is a minimum $100 difference, the biggest difference is that none of the Knott's passes have any blackout days (so you can go to knott's 365 days a year with the $86 pass) where Disney has blackout dates for all but the $800 pass (Note: SoCal resident passes are not valid for the 24 hour day this friday).  If you have to choose one or the other really base it on the experience you want.  Knott's/Six Flags both will have a much more thrilling experience (California Screaming at Disney is much tamer than most of the coasters at Six Flags and I've heard similar feed back about Knott's) where Disney is all about the total experience.  I feel way more immersed at Disney than i do at other theme parks.   As /u/mildly_interesting put it you get what you pay for and that shows a lot in the overall quality of the experience. Disney in my mind takes the cake but it's really nice to have some thrill options near by.  I know this may not have answered your question about value but I hope it helps a little!"
orangecounty,36nt80,aholtz,3,Wed May 20 20:04:07 2015 UTC,"I haven't checked the prices recently, but I believe Knott's is cheaper. That being said, I know my son likes Disneyland way more than Knott's. I think Disneyland also has more to see/do vs Knott's."
orangecounty,36nt80,ultradip,6,Wed May 20 19:38:39 2015 UTC,I don't need to check to know Disney is more expensive than Knott's.
orangecounty,36nt80,Shatteredreality,2,Wed May 20 21:13:14 2015 UTC,It is exactly 3.4x more expensive than the Knott's Annual Pass.
orangecounty,36nt80,KKsofierce,3,Wed May 20 22:15:49 2015 UTC,Don't forget Magic Mountain if you really like coasters!
orangecounty,36nt80,Shatteredreality,2,Wed May 20 19:55:38 2015 UTC,If you are going for coaster I'd totally recommend getting a Knott's and a Magic Mountain pass!   Over all it is cheaper than getting the entry level Disney pass.

Disney puts top notch effort into maintaining the atmosphere of the park, and their customer service is superb. Also the Dole whips are delicious.   I personally hate Disneyland because I would prefer to ride roller coasters and not deal with crowds. If you want more roller coasters and you want an empty park to roam around, go to Knott's (or Six Flags if you don't mind the drive)."

orangecounty,36nt80,SushiRoe,1 point,Wed May 20 22:18:28 2015 UTC,"When the kids are out of school it gets packed, but the rest of the year on the weekdays it really is a ghost town.  I tend to only go in the winter and I like that I can walk right onto every ride in the park."
orangecounty,36nt80,thissisnotathrowaway,3,Sat May 23 02:27:08 2015 UTC,I have a Disney pass and everyone else in my family has a knott's pass. Knott's is cheaper sure but it seems like they went once or twice and never bothered to go back. I pay $40/month for Disney and go once a week or every other week so I definitely get my moneys worth. I never get tired of it and nothing makes me happier than getting buzzed and going on star tours. I was the rebel spy. Twice.
orangecounty,36nt80,SushiRoe,2,Thu May 21 00:21:10 2015 UTC,"Disney. It's more expensive but worth it. They do special events for passholders, you get access to 2 theme parks, you get 10 or 15% [forget which] off all the food and merch and it's Disney. Also you can go for a couple hours after work and park for free at DT disney for 3 hours. Sometimes the wife and I just go to watch the fireworks. In addition they're having a ton of new stuff for their 60th anniversary starting at the end of the week.  Disneyland is a great plan B for if you got nothing going on and just want to hangout."
orangecounty,36nt80,muj561,2,Wed May 20 20:45:47 2015 UTC,"Well you need to ask yourself ""Am I rich?"". If the answer is yes, then go for the Disney passes. If not, grab the Knott's one."
orangecounty,36nt80,cejansen,1 point,Wed May 20 19:47:03 2015 UTC,"Disney offers monthly payments to soften the blow. But it does require an upfront payment of $99 + first payment. So, its fairly affordable if you budget for it accordingly."
orangecounty,36nt80,UnderwritingRules,1 point,Wed May 20 21:00:25 2015 UTC,"I saved up for the monthly payment but realized if I pay more for the down payment, I could pay less for the monthly. I ended up paying it off within 4 months because the monthly payment was so low that I just made 2 or 3 payments each month!"
orangecounty,36nt80,FuzzySlippers4Me,1 point,Wed May 20 22:06:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah but those blackouts dates though. For SoCal Passholders, you're essentially paying for the months of June/July/August without being able to go!"
orangecounty,36nt80,ToadGamaken,1 point,Wed May 20 22:16:34 2015 UTC,"I guess it depends entirely on which pass you get. I'm only available during the weekends and on occasions, a few weekdays, so the cheapest one isn't an option for me. I'm not too big on roller coasters - the choice is a lot easier for me."
orangecounty,36nt80,mybikesareshit,4,Wed May 20 23:31:32 2015 UTC,"The fundamental question of OC life.  I think you gotta go DL. It's more expensive, but you have access to both parks there and just being a pass holder makes the DL experience more fun. Kids cranky? Okay--days over. You're not held hostage by the money you paid to get in. Trust me--take your misbehaving kids home after an hour at DL and once the shock resolves they'll never think your bluffing again. Have a free evening with the wife? Just run down for a couple of hours for a cool date night. Bust the kids out of school at noon on a random Tuesday and enjoy five minute lines. It's just really nice having a pass.   We personally rotate. One year DL, next Knotts, next universal or the zoo or something random, then repeat with DL the next year.  Be advised: the Knotts pass is a season pass--January to December. You but it in May and half it's value is lost to the calendar. Not so DL"

The big upside of getting a pass is you can go often for a few hours at a time instead of cramming it all into less frequent visits. There's so much to see, eat and do and the experience is a little different each time."

orangecounty,36k19u,neoreii,1 point,Thu May 21 17:47:37 2015 UTC,Why not both? Have discussions on facebook (private or public?) and ask active members or meetup attendees to join linkedin group.

orangecounty,36kg8v,Blinkboarder85,9,Wed May 20 01:15:15 2015 UTC,"The only one that I know about is The Blind Rabbit in Anaheim.  if you go to their website, they give you their coordinates instead of address.  It's actually hidden in the Anaheim Packing District."
orangecounty,36kg8v,Tbonejones,2,Wed May 20 02:10:30 2015 UTC,Looks like a pretty cool place. I'll have to check it out.
orangecounty,36kg8v,lilteapot,5,Wed May 20 02:42:26 2015 UTC,Definitely make reservations. We happened to be at the Packing District this past Saturday and tried to get a table. The next available time was 11 pm (and it was 7 when we were there).
orangecounty,36kg8v,Tbonejones,3,Wed May 20 15:19:11 2015 UTC,Yeah -- let me know if you can't find it -- I can provide more specific instructions if needed.

orangecounty,36kg8v,poolhaus,6,Wed May 20 16:45:55 2015 UTC,"A more casual ""speakeasy"" in LA. You go up to the bouncer guy sitting outside of a garage. He tells you to make yourself at home and there's beers in the fridge. The fridge leads to the actual bar out back."
orangecounty,36kg8v,nouse66,4,Wed May 20 13:01:55 2015 UTC,Casa Costa Mesa is supposedly a legit one: http://casacostamesa.com  There's also Pie Society behind Pitfire in Costa Mesa but that's really just a bar without a sign.
orangecounty,36kg8v,BlaQout,1 point,Wed May 20 06:56:23 2015 UTC,Casa is great. I go there about a couple times a month. You have to RSVP on their website. I also suggest following them on their instagram as they post who they have playing music on certain nights.
orangecounty,36kg8v,jdbrew,6,Wed May 20 16:31:55 2015 UTC,"People have mentioned The Blind Rabbit, which is cool. Its small. The drinks are really out there but taste very good. Beer selection wasn't great. This is more focused on their house drinks than bringing in good beer.  Not really a speakeasy but its kind of hidden is The Copper Door in Santa Ana. If I remember correctly they only door craft beer but they bring in some great beer.  If you like beer, OC has a pretty lively craft brewing scene. The Bruery in Placentia is probably the biggest name globally that OC has for high quality beers. They ship internationally and have quite the following among beer connoisseur's but outside of that is Bootleggers in Fullerton, Phantom Ales in Anaheim,  Noble Ale Works in Anaheim, Bottle Logic in Anaheim (which to me is the worst in OC, but just my opinion), Barley Forge in Costa Mesa, Newport Beach Brewing Co in Newport Beach, Four Sons in Huntington Beach, Tustin Brewing Company in Tustin, Anaheim Brewery in Anaheim, Valiant Brewing Co in Orange. And there's even more than that, those are just the ones in North OC that I frequent the most.  I'm not much use on goods bars for mixed drinks, when I'm not having beer, I'm having bourbon, and I typically drink bourbon at home not at bars."
orangecounty,36kg8v,skullscrashdown,2,Wed May 20 18:45:09 2015 UTC,"I find it interesting that you have tried all of these breweries and find bottle logic the worst. Was it a specific beer you had? The atmosphere? I thoroughly enjoy their brews, while the Anaheim brewery selection bores me. I also get enjoyment out of their little Noble vs Bottle Logic ""stand-off."""
orangecounty,36kg8v,jdbrew,1 point,Fri May 22 15:23:47 2015 UTC,"I actually had two flights from bottle logic, and had all 10 beers they had on tap. I should say Anaheim is worse in that they had beers that I thought actually tasted awful, but I really enjoyed their Red. Bottle Logic didn't have any that tasted bad, but  all ten I had were completely forgettable and boring and didn't taste good. They were just whatever. Anaheim's red I actually really liked. And Bottle Logic can't hold a candle to Noble. Noble is probably the best small Brewery we have IMO.   I should also mention that I am extremely biased against Bottle Logic because of a lot of the stories I've heard about their owners (I have a few friends in the industry who know them). The rumors are that the owners are three lawyers who don't give a shit about good beer, but had money to invest and knew beer is on a rise right now so invested in a brewery. They limit their brewers from doing anything truly good and want very low alcohol, low flavor beers that would appeal to masses. Think like bud light or PBR with a ""craft"" label. at least thats what I'm told. And then they decided to spend a HUGE portion of their start up funds on marketing, which shows. Its really well designed and looks great inside. The other rumor is that when Hangar 24 came in for a meeting about distributing for them, they threw out some outrageous demands about minimum orders and demanding they be in a certain number of bars and a whole bunch of weird shit. And Hangar 24 walked out and said they were a bunch of assholes... Or so the rumors go. I feel like I need to qualify this over and over as hearsay since they are three lawyers and could probably squash me for slander or some shit like that. They aren't nice people from what I'm told.  But the Patrick Rue at the Bruery? Nicest dude you could run into. Talked and drank with him a few times. Victor from Taps and now at Eagle Rock (I believe) helped me do a school project and gave me private tours of his brewery and gave me a ton of free beer. The guys at Phantom ales are super nice guys, and the guys at Noble only want to make good beer and are nice to everyone who walks in. Never even seen the owners of bottle logic at their own brewery. Admittedly I try not to go as much as possible so the sample is small, but I've had beers with Patrick in his own tasting room because he's just a down to earth cool dude."
orangecounty,36kg8v,vagabondsean,2,Fri May 22 17:39:10 2015 UTC,I had heard of a 20's themed speakeasy in....mission viejo? I'm not sure if it's still there or even how to go about finding information on it.   The TV show Best Bars in America did a speakeasy episode the other week and hit a few in LA. La Descarga was a cool looking Cuban themed bar that you entered through a closet and Blind Barber in Culver city looks like a regular old school barber shop but if you go through the door to the back room there's an awesome bar.
orangecounty,36kg8v,cire1184,2,Wed May 20 18:24:58 2015 UTC,"In LA there are a few.  La Descarga, Good Times at Davey Waynes, No Vacancy, basically anything these guys open is either hard to find or has a secret entrance http://houstonhospitalityla.com/  You can also check out Varnish, The Association, Lock and Key, Next Door Lounge, and Honeycut.   Sorry all these places are in LA."
orangecounty,36kg8v,antifret,3,Thu May 21 23:11:25 2015 UTC,I don't get it. What's the point? If Starbucks did this everyone would make fun of them and noone would go there but Joe Hipster decides to do it and people want to go there?
orangecounty,36kg8v,antifret,0,Wed May 20 16:20:40 2015 UTC,I guess it's just a bit different than regular bars/lounges.  I'm just looking for some place unique and different to grab a drink.

orangecounty,36k1ky,BlurryFont,7,Tue May 19 23:25:05 2015 UTC,"2br/2bath for $1600? Good luck, I think everyone would love that rate around Irvine. Expect to get IAC ass-blasted in price around here. Best I could find is 1665/mo but I can't speak for the community itself. Check Yelp for reviews, YMMV.  http://www.zillow.com/homedetails/100-Simplicity-9426213-Irvine-CA-92620/2103037960_zpid/  For house or Townhome rentals, that's kind of up in the air. Homeowners know they sit on a nice check so their rates vary, Townhome rental may be a good bet though.  http://www.zillow.com/homes/0_fs/0_mmm/1_fr/1_z/2-_beds/2-_baths/Irvine,-ca_rb/33.774477,-117.678462,33.599523,-117.87004_rect/52650_rid/house,townhome_type/priced_sort/  Either way if you mean around as in neighboring cities, lower markets like Tustin or Lake forest might be a better bet, and they border Irvine pretty closely. Also further south Aliso Viejo or Mission Viejo is similar. If you don't mind using the toll roads every now and then, I would recommend Foothill Ranch or Rancho Santa Margarita, too."

orangecounty,36k1ky,hellscaper,2,Wed May 20 00:55:33 2015 UTC,lol yeah I mean its sad to say but the 1665 is more realistic for a 665 sqft place than it is for a 2 bed 2 bath around here.  598 SQFT at my complex is $1650 so its actually about right....probably the 2BR/2BA is the typo.

orangecounty,36ht0t,Brownprobe,1 point,Tue May 19 22:34:12 2015 UTC,"Just do a hard reset. Fixes the ""powers on but blank screen"" issue 90% of the time with laptops. Unplug the laptop, remove the battery, push and hold the power button for about 10 seconds, put the battery back in, turn it on. If the laptop is less than 3 years old, I bet it works.  If that doesn't work and you're getting absolutely nothing on the screen at all, but the fans and lights are turning on, then odds are that your screen or motherboard is dead. You can test the screen by plugging into an external monitor and seeing if you get picture.  If your motherboard is dead, it's probably time for a new laptop."

orangecounty,36ht0t,DEDMON,1 point,Tue May 19 14:59:55 2015 UTC,"What model is your laptop? Do you have anything on the screen? Sometimes it will be really faint.  If you hold down the Letter D on the laptop keyboard while turning the computer on, you may be able to get a display test, This will be a series of colors. If not then you probably just have a unplugged or bad lcd cable and as Chip and Peach said you should be able to just reconnect it.   If you see faint text or colors then your inverter is bad and you will have to replace the LCD screen, which is very cheap as well if you buy it and put it in yourself.

orangecounty,36hsj4,JimSFV,8,Tue May 19 14:13:41 2015 UTC,Been to talbert hundreds of times to ride bmx at sheep hills. There is a little bit of homeless problem but nothing scary. They also always have a ranger or two in the park at all times to prevent all the homeless people there. Anyways the homeless people who stay there are more of the hippie kind than the tweaked kind.
orangecounty,36hsj4,Spooped,6,Tue May 19 15:27:56 2015 UTC,"If you're worried about how the neighborhood you want to move to will be, visit the area at different times of the day (including in the middle of the night) to see how it is.   Also park near the local liquor store or 7-11 and see what kind of people shop there. It'll be a good indicator of the local riff raff."
orangecounty,36hsj4,hardkoretom,2,Tue May 19 15:50:46 2015 UTC,"That report was 15 years ago from information they probably pulled from the 90s. Dana Point had a pretty bad drug and crime problem back in the 90s. It used to be real bad. City has cleaned up quite a lot since then. I mean, 15 years is a really long time.  If you want to know the crime statistics for Newport Beach, look at the NBPD website's crime stats (spots 21, 24, 16, or 17 is my guess for your area?)  Unless you need crime stats for Costa Mesa. That will show city wide crime statistics, not so much of select areas like Newport Beach. Or you can try the search function for your neighborhood or address on this page. Not sure how accurate that is.   Homeless people are everywhere. Maybe more in certain areas, but they are everywhere. Not every homeless person is some cracked out thief that you need to be scared of. Dana Point has it's fair share of homeless and not very much is there any real crime from them. Usually just drunk in public or disorderly conduct or small crimes of that nature.   I don't know much personally about the area surrounding Talbert Regional Park, so I can't say for certain of that exact location."
orangecounty,36hsj4,meeshkyle,4,Tue May 19 14:46:36 2015 UTC,"They are homeless, but (usually) harmless. They just hang out at the park because they have no where else."
orangecounty,36hsj4,oOoleveloOo,3,Tue May 19 16:33:14 2015 UTC,Why not call the police station closest to the park? They'll tell you how many calls they get and the nature of them.
orangecounty,36hsj4,SSSS_car_go,2,Tue May 19 14:34:57 2015 UTC,I live over by Fairview Park. I've heard that there are homeless people that sleep along the river. I haven't heard of anyone causing problems.  A couple of times a year a police helicopter flies over the park and river late at night to shoo homeless people out of the park.
orangecounty,36f2gd,pirateofcatan,21,Mon May 18 21:58:27 2015 UTC,Talk to the neighbors? Maybe they don't realize how loud they are being?
orangecounty,36f2gd,AliceJoy,16,Tue May 19 02:32:10 2015 UTC,"I don't understand why being neighborly is being downvoted while ""call the cops"" like a hermit troll seems to be the standard advice."
orangecounty,36f2gd,WhiteE350,-4,Tue May 19 05:49:17 2015 UTC,Because leaving your home and actually doing something that could be uncomfortable isn't what these pussies do. They'd rather sit and hide and call the cops and then say it's because the neighbors would know who ratted  them out. No shit? People avoid confrontation at all costs like a  scared little mouse.
orangecounty,36f2gd,le_emperor,6,Tue May 19 14:45:47 2015 UTC,"Exactly. Walk out your front door climb your stairs knock on their door, introduce yourself, shake hands, make eye contact, explain your situation calmly and assertively and exchange phone numbers so you can contact them if the problem continues.   If calling the cops is your first move in such a mild situation you are a fucking cowardly asshole. God forbid you actually act assertive. It's good to be on a first name basis with your neighbors."
orangecounty,36f2gd,WhiteE350,-11,Tue May 19 15:04:40 2015 UTC,As much as I loved the lack of certain types of people in Irvine. I had to move to a place where everybody where not such pussies. Hopefully those aforementioned people can't afford Villa Park.
orangecounty,36f2gd,le_emperor,4,Tue May 19 15:26:54 2015 UTC,"I would agree that this is a reasonable course of action at first, but they have already gotten notices about the noise so they should realize they are being loud. At this point it seems to me that they just don't give a shit."
orangecounty,36f2gd,pdelponte,39,Tue May 19 17:46:22 2015 UTC,Call the cops.
orangecounty,36f2gd,drkstr632,13,Mon May 18 22:10:33 2015 UTC,Go with this.  Cops will get sick of you calling eventually.  Doubt they do anything but tell them to stop the first 3-4 times but...they will get fed up a look for a reason to do something more if you call often enough.  Dealt with this myself before.
orangecounty,36f2gd,somenamehere1234,22,Tue May 19 02:13:53 2015 UTC,This is simple: go in to the front office during business hours and tell them and also call the police dept when the noise is happening in the off hours.   your lease guarantees you certain things and quiet after hours is one of them. I have a hard time believing they simply won't address the issue.
orangecounty,36f2gd,Oaktree3,9,Mon May 18 22:18:53 2015 UTC,They've told me that they've spoken to the tenant and sent them notices.  I assume it takes a while to do anything further than that.
orangecounty,36f2gd,Oaktree3,15,Mon May 18 22:50:44 2015 UTC,Yeah probably a few more noise complaints should do it.  My experience with IAC is the squeaky wheel gets the grease. Complain EVERY time. Call or go in every morning after they've been loud after hours.
orangecounty,36f2gd,kadaan,7,Mon May 18 23:00:13 2015 UTC,Keep it up. I'm sure they're required to send a certain amount of notices before they're allowed to take any real actions.
orangecounty,36f2gd,jalop,1 point,Tue May 19 04:30:00 2015 UTC,This. A friend of mine just had the same situation with his neighbors. They can give them 2-3 warnings before they escalate to a possible eviction. Have your other neighbors complain as well. Tell the office that they either need to do something about the noise or find you another apartment in the community.
orangecounty,36f2gd,layer8issues,6,Tue May 19 13:32:24 2015 UTC,"Keep complaining.  18 yrs ago I was the noisy one and the big thing that did it for us was the police visiting. We also got blacklisted from IAC, but that wasn't helpful to my current neighbors,  as it went in effect after we moved out"
orangecounty,36f2gd,skuba21,5,Tue May 19 02:48:19 2015 UTC,"This happened to me at the Esperanza Apartment Homes a few years ago.  I had lived there for nearly two years without a single complaint until I got a new upstairs neighbor who kept me up pretty much every night.  I ended up taking your route and complaining to the office fourteen separate times.  I found that they not only refused to address the situation, they would continually change their story on how to address it; basically they lie.  They eventually allowed me to move to another Irvine Company property without paying for the lease break.  I agree with the general consensus in this thread: call the police, and keep calling for every incident.  Don't listen to anything the leasing office asks you to do because they don't care, they are just trying to get rid of you."
orangecounty,36f2gd,graphique,11,Tue May 19 13:09:42 2015 UTC,"Call the cops...I'm surprised of all companies, Irvine Apartment Communities, or whatever they're called, aren't hawks about this stuff."
orangecounty,36f2gd,HarveySpecs,7,Mon May 18 22:46:47 2015 UTC,Yep. Worked for irvine company. These guys are usually sticklers and assholes about noise complaints and is pretty surprising they haven't jumped on this.
orangecounty,36f2gd,The_Maester,4,Tue May 19 03:02:18 2015 UTC,"Do all the IC properties have a courtesy patrol? We've always been able to call them and have someone out pretty quickly over noise complaints (e.g. people being loud in the pool area at night). If you log into your MyRental-Living account, you should be able to see if there's a number you can call for this kind of thing."
orangecounty,36f2gd,Jehu920,5,Tue May 19 03:50:23 2015 UTC,I've been calling them without seeing any effect.  My impression is that the courtesy patrol is powerless and the tenants know it.

orangecounty,36f2gd,Jehu920,11,Thu May 21 22:02:45 2015 UTC,"Going to go against the grain here and suggest you talk to them first. They're people too and although it's Shitty they don't tell you it may just be a genuine mistake on their part. Maybe I'm too nice, but I'd only call the cops after talking to them"
orangecounty,36f2gd,kadaan,14,Tue May 19 01:42:36 2015 UTC,"I think the danger with that is that with that course of action, it leaves them with no doubt at all who has been lodging all the complaints against them.  There are some people out there who will take that as all the reason they need to regularly go out of their way to screw with their life."
orangecounty,36f2gd,Jehu920,4,Tue May 19 03:18:34 2015 UTC,"True, but with that logic it leaves no doubt who's Fucking with you and then you can pursue further action. I don't know I just give people the benefit of the doubt. I like to believe that most people aren't assholes."
orangecounty,36f2gd,Pablopubes,9,Tue May 19 03:45:43 2015 UTC,"I tend to agree with you, but if they're still doing it after multiple notices from the management it doesn't sound like they really care."
orangecounty,36f2gd,pdelponte,2,Tue May 19 04:32:01 2015 UTC,Well blowing off management and blowing off a kind neighbor are two very different things. I see where you're coming from though. Either way.
orangecounty,36f2gd,ITMANAGER_KILLME_PLS,2,Tue May 19 04:44:42 2015 UTC,I agree. Try to handle the situation personally first. If the problem persists get the authorities involved.

I'm all for being a civil person and giving someone the benefit of the doubt, but these people have already shown they don't give a shit about others. You don't want that kind of person to know who you are, much less have a beef against you because they perceive you to be the one complaining. Just call the cops and keep telling management. They will be gone in 60 to 90 days."
orangecounty,36f2gd,wsupreddit,3,Tue May 19 17:45:14 2015 UTC,Get your neighbors to complain to management a few times as well.
orangecounty,36f2gd,mtux96,5,Tue May 19 01:53:21 2015 UTC,"I do not recommend what I did but it got the job done. I went to the persons door and asked them to stop playing live music in their apartment, literally drums and a guitar. They said ok then did it again ten minutes later. I told the guy to shut up or I would make him shut up. He called the Irvine company on me but other tenants backed me up so they sent him a final notice since he had prior complaints and he was never loud again. Usually Irvine company won't tolerate that stuff."
orangecounty,36f2gd,le_emperor,3,Tue May 19 02:15:01 2015 UTC,"I'm going through this as we speak!  I'm on the ground floor and the apartment above us is constantly having large groups of friends (with kids) over.  Even when there aren't people, there is never a time when I don't know exactly where everyone is in the apartment.  They're stompers, they get into loud verbal arguments with door slamming, and they have a newborn kid now, so they're waking up all hours of the night and stomping their way over to the crib, waking me up at night.  They're constantly pouring things off their balcony and onto my patio, sometimes soaking my stuff.  IAC has been completely powerless in stopping it all.  They act very concerned when I go up to the front office to complain about it, but have done nothing to help.  Calling the after hours security is no help either-- they are unable to act unless they can hear activity from outside the neighbor's house, which they can't because stomping doesn't travel through the front door.  You need to start calling the police when this happens.  Call the Irvine PD non-emergency line.  After repeated calls, Irvine PD will send notification to the IAC office.  Additionally, for noise complaints, Irvine PD will fine the tenants above you based on how many cars are needed to respond to the call.  Because Irvine is Irvine, they'll usually send multiple cars for even minor cases.  Continue to report the problem to front office.  IAC will not do anything beyond giving them a call or leaving them a notice.  After repeated complaints, I even opened up to relocation in within the facility.  No dice-- would not even move me to an identical apartment across the hall without trying to give me a ridiculous increase.  I wish I had better advice for you-- I was not able to resolve my problem and I've resorted to eating the cost of moving.  This time, I'll be on the top floor.    There is nothing worse that people living in apartment who do not realize they're living in an apartment.  Irvine Company gives you the illusion that you're living in luxury, but completely fall flat on their faces when it comes to delivering when push comes to shove and they're forced to deal with a bad tenant.  Please feel free to ask me any questions about my experience.  I've toughed it out for the full year and I'm at the end of my lease now, but I've gone down several different avenues to try to fix the problem-- maybe I can help cross a few off your list.  In any case though, good luck!"

It was our first time living in an apartment in such close quarters to other people, we wanted to start off on the right foot.  We've got a good relationship with a couple neighbors-- unfortunately, they aren't the ones that live above us."
orangecounty,36f2gd,tossy_mctosserson,5,Wed May 20 07:07:50 2015 UTC,"Before you call the cops, make sure what they are doing is even illegal. If Irvine PD is like most cities, they won't even acknowledge noise complaints until after 10pm.  Do some research on that before you call. Also, don't call 911, find out Irvine's ""non-emergency line"" and call that."
orangecounty,36f2gd,pipboylover,2,Tue May 19 03:38:55 2015 UTC,"I'd go to the leasing office and ask the manager if there's a night-time security patrol you should report this to, or whether you should just call the local police. If there's a night-time patrol, they may be able to help.  At the very least, letting the manager know you're willing to bring the police into this might light a fire and prompt some action by the Irvine Company.  Also, if you haven't done so already, start keeping a list of every time you've made a complaint.  It could come in handy in the future.  Good luck!"
orangecounty,36f2gd,didyouwoof,6,Tue May 19 06:11:01 2015 UTC,"Call the cops.  Personally, I'd take the additional steps to let my manager know that I was now going to start calling the cops.  Multiple police calls isn't good for the manager's career."

It will ultimately be paid as part of your deal (deal costs factored into the total deal) but you won't be responsible for writing them a check.

orangecounty,36bixi,Nugur,4,Mon May 18 03:50:44 2015 UTC,"Have you considered asking local rescue groups for help? She seems like a pretty chill cat. Not to sound rude, but why don't you keep her? Cats are pretty low maintenance pets. And she seems to like you if she's following you. Just a thought. Please, whatever you do OP, please do to abandon her. Find her a safe home if you can't keep her. She shouldn't be left behind twice. I'll repost her to my FB and if anything comes up I'll PM you."
orangecounty,36bixi,FawkesFire13,4,Mon May 18 05:01:24 2015 UTC,"You're not being rude at all. And you're right, cats are fairly independent. Unfortunately, I have a few extended travel in the near future. That's too much to leave any pet alone. I would have to board her, either with a service or with a friend. And I'm moving soon. That's a lot of changes in living environment. Rescue group is a last option."
orangecounty,36bixi,FawkesFire13,1 point,Mon May 18 05:21:43 2015 UTC,"That's fair. Would you keep her if a friend was willing to board her for a while? Sorry if I'm prying. I've just seen how some cats react to being shuffled around from home to home. They get depressed. It's sad really. Again, I completely understand why you want to find her a home. I'm not trying to be pushy or rude. Just want to know if I found someone who could maybe board her for a while if you'd come back for her. If not, no worries. I'll still look for a new home for her."
orangecounty,36bixi,superbread,2,Mon May 18 05:34:52 2015 UTC,"That's the problem. I have a few extended travels in the near future. It would mean having the cat being boarded at several different places. I don't have a friend who's willing to be a repeated boarder. If I do, that friend would just have taken the cat."
orangecounty,36bixi,GreatCosmicBlort,1 point,Mon May 18 06:05:40 2015 UTC,"I hate having to say this, but it's the truth. You should start looking for a rescue group right away since they are extremely full with kitten season. It'll take them time to see if they can open a spot for you with a foster or boarding, so it's best to start gathering rescue options. If you cannot rehome her, then at least they may have a spot for her when it comes to the time when you have to absolutely get her a new place.  If you do happen to rehome her, then great! The rescue can then take in a different cat - but if you don't connect with one sooner than later, there might not be a rescue option for her (if there is a deadline)"

Outdoor fireplaces, fire pits, fire rings, or similar exterior devices used at Group R shall comply with this section.  Exception: Barbeques, grills, and other portable devices intended for cooking.  307.6.1 Gas-Fueled Devices. Outdoor fireplaces, fire pits and similar devices fueled by natural gas or liquefied-petroleum gas are allowed when approved by the Building Department and the device is designed to only burn a gas flame and not wood or other solid fuel. At R-3 occupancies, combustible construction shall not be located within three feet of an atmospheric column that extends vertically from the perimeter of the device. At other R occupancies, the minimum distance shall be ten feet.

Where chimneys or vents are installed, they shall have a spark arrester in accordance with Section 305.5.  307.6.2 Devices Using Wood or Fuels Other Than Natural Gas or Liquefied Petroleum Gas. Fireplaces burning wood or other solid fuel shall be constructed in accordance with the California Building Code and Section 305.5. Fires in a fireplace shall be contained within a firebox with an attached chimney. The opening in the face of the firebox shall have an installed and maintained method of arresting sparks. The burning of wood or other solid fuel in a device is not allowed within 15 feet of combustible structures, unless within a permanent or portable fireplace. Conditions which could cause a fire to spread within 25 feet of a structure or to vegetation shall be eliminated prior to ignition. Fires in devices burning wood or solid fuel shall be managed per Section 307.5.  307.6.2.1 Where Prohibited. The burning of wood and other solid fuels shall not be conducted within a fuel modification zone. Wood and other solid fuel burning fires in devices other than permanent fireplaces are not allowed within Wildfire Risk Areas (WRA) and adopted Fire Hazard Severity Zones (FHSZ) and Special Fire Protection Areas (SFPA) or in locations where conditions could cause the spread of fire to the WRA or FHSZ, unless determined by the Fire Code Official that the location or design of the device should reasonably prevent the start of a wildfire.

orangecounty,36bgmd,basidia,5,Mon May 18 01:52:57 2015 UTC,graduate student housing is the best housing in OC in my opionion. Really good prices.

orangecounty,36bgmd,basidia,3,Mon May 18 03:46:21 2015 UTC,There's still hope. I was on the wait list last year and got an offer within a few months.

Depending on your hours, commuting from Anaheim to UCI could be about an hour drive each way (and it will be 30/40 minutes regardless).  $1,500 for a 2 bedroom is definitely low for Irvine, but you may get lucky in certain parts of Costa Mesa, South Coast Plaza metro area, Santa Ana, Westminster, and/or Fountain Valley.

orangecounty,36auu1,wsupreddit,7,Sun May 17 22:36:14 2015 UTC,"Well some Disneyland tips I can give you are:   If you want some Dole Whip, don't stand in the outside line, outside the Tiki Room waiting area. Go through the turnstile (you can get out the same way) into the waiting area and wait for it in there (The Dole Whip place is double sided, but people don't know this and end up waiting like 25 mins as opposed to no wait). Play the fast pass game. If you're going to both California Adventure and Disneyland, they are on different fast pass systems, and therefore you can get 1 at each park at the same time. I suggest you prioritize rides: Indiana Jones, Space Mountain, Thunder Mountain, Cars Racers, California Screamin, for the fast passes. Clam Chowder at the Wharf in California Adventure is pretty dank, and you can go into the Boudin and Ghirardelli places for a free sample of bread and chocolate. You can go in as much as you want, they give it at the door. You can ask for a free water cup anywhere, so don't stress on water.   You can't do everything in Disneyland in one day, so don't expect to and just enjoy your time there. But if you end up being a single rider, many rides have separate lines for single riders and usually they are shorter than waiting through the full line."

orangecounty,3681ie,M5BMW,1 point,Sun May 17 01:59:13 2015 UTC,"I'm sure that they are annoyed, but honestly as long as they get enough people that come in for the $5 gift card that buy a car it works for them.  The vast majority of advertising is ignored by consumers, but if you easily have hundreds or even potentially thousands of dollars worth of profit on a high end model car dealerships can afford to have a lot of their mailers to get thrown away."
orangecounty,3681ie,SAugsburger,3,Sun May 17 15:15:53 2015 UTC,Waste more gas driving there than its worth.
orangecounty,3681ie,Sour_J,1 point,Sun May 17 15:55:03 2015 UTC,Exactly.  Unless you were already marginally interested in buying a car in the near future anyways most people aren't going to bother because unless you live down the street the gas will cost more than the gift card.
orangecounty,3681ie,SAugsburger,9,Sun May 17 16:07:41 2015 UTC,"There's a Nissan dealer in San Juan Capistrano that does this. I didn't have much else to do one Saturday so I walked in with my ""winning ticket"" and walked out with a $1 lottery scratcher.   They didn't pressure me too bad. Just asked if I was in the market for a car and when I said no I was out the door."
orangecounty,3681ie,Bossomatic,1 point,Sun May 17 01:56:54 2015 UTC,Exactly.  $1 isn't exactly a ton of money just to at least get you on the lot.  Most people unless they live down the street are going to spend more than that on gas to get there and back so most people aren't going to go there unless they are at least somewhat interested in a car.
orangecounty,3681ie,SAugsburger,4,Sun May 17 15:12:18 2015 UTC,"You can indeed win one of the prizes if your number matches the prize board, but the odds are slim (obviously). Dealers, or the ad agency that creates and distributes the mailers, buys insurance on the prizes mentioned in the mailers, including the car that can be won.  This may not be typical of all dealers and these scratch off direct mailers, but when I worked for an agency that did these for a large group of So Cal dealers, people who simply came in and claimed a gift card or low value giveaway had their info scrubbed from the mailing list for future mailers, to weed out those who weren't serious about purchasing a car."

orangecounty,364r4r,coconutmango,15,Sat May 16 03:14:37 2015 UTC,"Here's my advice, I've had cats my whole life. This is a situation I've encountered before. First, keep your cat inside. He's probably running into a stray that's territorial. To help with the boredom and meowing try getting new toys, a scratching post and some catnip. Give him some time. He needs someone to love him and rehoming him will only add to this stress. You seem like your heart is in the right place, OP. Try giving him some extra one on one attention. Or get a kitty leash and start training him. That would probably be your best bet. I've got two leash trained kitties and they do great."

orangecounty,364r4r,FawkesFire13,1 point,Mon May 18 02:58:29 2015 UTC,"Of course. He looks like a real sweetheart. But leash training can really help a cat like him. So that way he has supervised time with you can relieve some stress by being outside but not in danger. Territorial cats are a huge problem for domestic cats and they can certainly be bullies to your cat. But try and give him something to burn some energy out on. Like new toys, a small scratching post works wonders. Also catnip. Catnip is great. And spend some more time with him. It'll help a lot. Give him time to recover. If you've got any questions, shoot me a PM. I don't mind giving a few pointers."

orangecounty,364l5h,ocpetthrowaway,6,Sat May 16 02:10:34 2015 UTC,"What breed are the dogs?  If they're not pitbulls or pitbull mixes or Chihuahuas, you might just be able to take them to the county shelter. If they're puppies or young there is a good chance they'll get adopted out fairly quickly. If they're pitbulls or chihuahuas, they'll probably get put down because there's just so many of them going through the shelter system.  Otherwise you should Google OC rescue societies. There are breed specific ones too. They might take the dogs off your hands.  If your mother and her boyfriend won't cooperate with you, I'd seriously consider just ""snitching"" on them to county animal control.

Its way better than HB because of freeway access alone.  Look for a one bedroom that offers parking.  You can walk to all of the local spots.  If you can't find one with parking but like it you can get a yearly parking pass for ~150.
orangecounty,3645wv,stunder,1 point,Sat May 16 15:26:06 2015 UTC,"Here is some information I've compiled since I've lived here and through my co-workers. Newport peninsula : 2 Co-workers newport pier ocean side on the boardwalk - 3500 a month 3 br place (one makes 168,000 one makes 85,000)  Rent split 1900, 1600 Primary complaints: Parking, noise at night  Back up off fashion island in newport park : Rent 2200 for a 2br. Little back off the action but still cheaper.  Lake forest, mission viejo, the 5 corridor : rates range from 1500-2200 for apartments.  Garden Grove / la brea / annaheim  = these areas you can get 1br's cheaper than 1000 with a commute by car.  So with taxes your take home is around 4800.  If you're living in the newport beach area you could be spending upwards of 2000 to live alone. IF you don't mind roommates you can probably get something in the 900-1500 dollar range.   Money saving tactics: Summer rates are always higher, try to find temporary housing till the end of the summer then look at the market again. You'll see rates are considerably lower.

Best place for mountain biking/road biking unless you gonna move to Silverado (you're not as it's relatively far) or Newport Coast (you can't afford it). Right on quail hill trail where you can link up to Bommer Canyon and El  Moro/Crystal Cove. Can even go from here to Laguna Coast to Aliso Woods depending on your endurance/skillz. Best off-road trails in the area and more bike paths here than anywhere else in OC (unless you count the SART maybe). Nothing to do in Newport Beach unless you like well the beach (boring mostly but surfing pretty fun) and weirdass beach bar culture.

orangecounty,363cl1,Halihax,2,Fri May 15 19:26:36 2015 UTC,"I'm just going to throw this out there, but you may want to broaden your search to interior decorating as well depending on what you're looking to do exactly. If it's changing up the furniture and some paint, you could probably get away with just a decorator. Adding/removing walls or anything that's a little more on the technical end would require a designer though. :)  (If I was already done with my certification, then I'd be game.)"
orangecounty,363cl1,mylifesaWIP,1 point,Tue May 19 14:17:08 2015 UTC,Thanks! Not thinking of removing/adding walls. Electrical work is most likely the most technical of things. Mostly just decorating on large-scale in addition to lighting.

orangecounty,35xeip,RaymondTerrific,1 point,Thu May 14 17:35:25 2015 UTC,So you just keep blasting warm water in until stuff falls out? How come when I do that nothing comes out?
orangecounty,35xeip,jairya,1 point,Thu May 14 14:50:59 2015 UTC,It probably wasn't water. There's special solutions you can use. Go to a drugstore and get an earwax removal kit. It's just a little dropper you squeeze into your ear that softens and breaks up wax.
orangecounty,35xeip,markegli,2,Thu May 14 15:10:59 2015 UTC,You're probably right. I have also used hydrogen peroxide and just let it sit in the canal until it stopped fizzing kind of like the earwax removal kit that I have as well. That works a bit. Both were still not as good as syringe from the doctor in my experience.
orangecounty,35xeip,haiimjeff,-1,Thu May 14 17:47:34 2015 UTC,"Not ""warm water"" - hot water, as hot will come out of the tap. And keep at it for 10-15 minutes or so."

orangecounty,35xeip,A_Crazy_Hooligan,2,Thu May 14 18:47:45 2015 UTC,Go to a regular doctor. My sister had a big earwax clog and the doctor used some sort of solution that included hydrogen peroxide.

orangecounty,35xeip,charmed2,0,Fri May 15 00:57:32 2015 UTC,"Buy a bottle of hydrogen peroxide at the dollar store and a big plastic syringe. (The ear cleaning kits are $5-10 depending on where you buy it, but it's just re-labled peroxide..just buy the cheap stuff.) Mix the peroxide 50/50 with warm water in a shot glass. Lay down on one side and pour the mixture in your ear and let it stew for about 5 minutes. It will sound like rice crispies with the mixture breaking up the wax. Then blast out your ear with hot water with the syringe. Repeat as many times as you need. You will be amazed at how much stuff will come out of your ears the first time you do this."

orangecounty,35twqt,ghettosorcerer,8,Wed May 13 18:24:31 2015 UTC,"Sorry for all the food suggestions that follow. I love food... so when I travel, I eat everything that's different. Definitely recommend a hike. Santiago Oaks or Top of the World Regional Park.   Anaheim Packing District is a local hangout, although not sure if it's a large tourist attraction. It's essentially a ""food hall"" a large warehouse converted to multiple restaurant vendors and bars. Go eat, grab a drink, listen to some live music, etc. Similarly, 4th St Market is the same setup, but not as big. Downtown Santa Ana has some great restaurants (Playground, North Left, Chapter One) and bars.   What I recommend though, if you're in Santa Ana is to stop by a crowded taco truck. They're usually parked along the side street. Just walk over and order a taco. I usually gauge by who has a bigger crowd.   I would think South Coast Plaza would be a nice area to visit. Largest mall on the West Coast and has really good food surrounding. If you head down Bristol St, you can find the local hipster hangout at [The Lab](thelab.com/) or [The Camp](thecampsite.com/). Another notable shop in the area is Mitsuwa Marketplace. Their food court has the best ramen in South OC. Santouka  If you like beer, OC has a lot of local breweries that you can visit. My favorites include Bottle Logic (check their awesome beer flight), Bruery, Noble Ale, and Bootleggers.   Beaches. We have the best beaches in Southern California (with the exception of Malibu). Screw Santa Monica, Screw Venice (although it's very fun to people watch there). Go to Laguna Beach.  Go to Crystal Cove. Go to Dana Point. Enjoy the stunning views without all the crowds.   I'm assuming you'll be around LA area too, if you'd like more suggestions for that I can name some. If you want something other than food let me know too. We're all here to help!"
orangecounty,35twqt,theedang,5,Wed May 13 15:14:45 2015 UTC,If you want to see OC than have a drink in the patio at the Orange Hill Restaurant.  The view is amazing and it isn't too crazy.

Check out all trails.com or one of those sites to find ones that might appeal to you Newport bar scene is pretty wild and a mix of dives and upscale. Also Sol has a delicious brunch, but there are probably tons of recommendations of brunches around there. That's just the one I've been to that I felt best.  if you like cars check out some of the cars and coffee shows/meets (usually Saturday mornings in south county/San Clemente, or first and last Saturday morning at a donut shop in HB, I can remember the name but if you're interested I'll find it out). OC is one of the greatest places to check out car culture...   Those are the things that pop lib to my mind that are pretty close in distance"
orangecounty,35twqt,graphique,1 point,Wed May 13 14:32:26 2015 UTC,The Cliff in Laguna Beach. Awesome little bar in the middle of art/jewelers/handmade items that sit on a cliff with great views. Just across the street is Big Fish Tavern. Go there and order the Poke.   Fiesta Grill in Huntington Beach for great hole in the wall Mexican food. Red Table in Huntington is also really good. Go to Aloha Grill on Main Street and order a Rainbow.    Blackies and Beach Ball are the best dive bars/locals spots in Newport Beach in my opinion. They're right on the water too. Go to Goathill Tavern for a real shit hole.   Dana Point has a great harbor with a couple bars. Turks is my favorite and feels more like a local spot. Go to Wind and Sea and get a Mai Tai.

Orange county has the country's 2nd largest tourist attraction, two major sporting venues, an commuter airport, the country's 3rd biggest shopping center, a world class university which also happens to be the county's second largest employer all within 15 miles of each other-- and you build light rail between a regional bus hub and a local civic center?     To me, this won't promote public transportation adoption-- it's going to convert people who already take buses for this corridor to using light rail instead.

Ideally a trolley would have right-of-way to go where it goes without stopping. I realize we can't build underground because of cost (though it would be awesome) and probably not above ground for similar reasons (though that would be even more awesome), so the next best is a trolley that can ignore all the traffic lights it goes through. Even better, if they could build it so it avoids roads entirely.  Trolleys are on tracks. At least, I've seen very few that aren't, but they're just buses built to look like a trolley."

orangecounty,35ojxb,callmeDNA,3,Tue May 12 07:13:14 2015 UTC,"Not sure of your age, but the Orange Circle had that college town feel (Chapman University is there) but without being obnoxious. There are quite a few good places to eat, get coffee, nice parks, and I like the location because if the freeways suck, you can take surface streets to Costa Mesa, Santa Ana, and Fullerton without it taking too much time.   Edit: just saw that you're just out of college. I think the Circle is perfect, it's a happy medium of fun and mellow."

orangecounty,35ojxb,meeshkyle,2,Tue May 12 23:34:29 2015 UTC,"I always like to say the Lantern District of Dana Point is kind of the small town of Orange County. Lots of restaurants, bars, and other things in walking distance. Harbor right below us. I've been in the Lantern District of Dana Point for about 5 or 6 years. The weather is different than the rest of the county, being on the beach (well, above the cliff) and not being so inland. The city puts on awesome events all year round, especially during summer. Always something to do in walking distance on the weekends. Usually free. Not as wild of the bar life as Costa Mesa and Newport. I would say a little more mellow, but still a good time for me going out. And did I mention the bars are all in walking distance? No DUI's or even the thought or attempt to even try. It suits my life and how I want to live it. I'm very happy here."

orangecounty,35ojxb,theseekerofbacon,1 point,Tue May 12 23:26:00 2015 UTC,Irvine. I think the location is right next to the airport
orangecounty,35ojxb,road2stamfordbridge,2,Thu May 14 04:50:11 2015 UTC,"You're actually pretty fine living anywhere at those rates. At long as you want a studio or one bedroom and not at the super ritzy places. Hell, you could easily live in Irvine at those rates.  If it was up to me, I would live within walking distance (or cheap uber distance) of downtown Santa Ana.  There's plenty of safe areas around. And the food and drink culture there is already pretty strong and growing quickly.  But that's where my priorities lie.  Honestly, you do you. If you want to live on the beach, do that. If you want to live in a safer area, go Irvine.  Tustin is a pretty nice area that's fairly central to a lot of places. But, in the end, I would say parts of northern Costa Mesa would probably be the best of all worlds."

And I reaaaally want to be live at the beach, but the prices are so damn expensive. The studios that I've found online are going around $1500. I feel like spending that much money on a bedroom-less apartment is a waste, and would feel wrong. But maybe the prices online don't represent the prices I'll find by driving around the area."

orangecounty,35ojxb,Fist2nuts,1 point,Wed May 13 09:06:28 2015 UTC,"Is that $1500 including gas, food, daily necessities, and rent? or just rent? I saw some apartments near Seal Beach and PCH going for $1000-$1300. It's a one bed, one bath, I'm not sure the sqft though. It seemed pretty roomie for a single person or even a couple. A plus is you're a house away from the beach and 10-15 minute walk from grocery stores and restaurants."
orangecounty,35ojxb,M5BMW,2,Tue May 12 07:16:37 2015 UTC,$1500 just for rent. (Although it would probably be wiser if the 1500 encompassed utilities and grocers). Could you tell me the general area where you saw these apartments? I'm going to start my apartment hunting in a week

orangecounty,35imkb,MephistosGhost,3,Sun May 10 23:04:04 2015 UTC,"It does sound mighty sexist, but consider the flip side with Winter Formal. I know from experience (thanks junior WF date) that the female friend groups had a similar idea, but rather than being randomly decided it was a first come first serve basis. This caused a lot of issues... ""OMG why'd you ask Jason I was going to!"" A lot of cat fights, and even guys fighting about what girl asked them, arose during WF season.   The draft, from my understanding, eliminates these issues. Obviously if 2 are ""talking"" they are removed from the situation. It simplifies the whole asking process for single kids. The rejection and what not was felt by people who weren't in the draft, as boys, myself included, had to pick from the hundreds of possible dates and pray that one worked out"

It's discriminatory in that regard. I'm not surprised this is happening at a South OC School since most people are already materialistic in those richer areas.

Compared to 149,500 per day or 54m gallons per year (365×149,500 =54,567,500).   So it would be 54m as part of 8.6b - 9.4b or 0.62% of Garden Grove's entire water use annually .... While it's obviously more than an individual citizen or household it's interesting to know it would be less than a little more than half a percent.   I'd wager that with more efficient water management and recycling they could use an even smaller percentage of their estimated use.

I wish GG would consider putting in some parks, or maybe open something that would have a good chance of staying open. That skeleton frame is just sad to look at. I keep wondering why it's never been taken down but left to rot."
orangecounty,35gjhw,Isamu66,2,Mon May 11 05:48:04 2015 UTC,Lol for sure.   I read recently that all the parties have finished suing each other and hopefully something will be done.  Maybe they can finish it and consolidate all the bikini coffee houses in one central location lol
orangecounty,35gjhw,FawkesFire13,1 point,Mon May 11 05:52:24 2015 UTC,There were still parted suing each other?!? Oh geez!  Lol! I think having one Mega Bikini Coffee House would be weirdly epic.

orangecounty,35gjhw,cj5,1 point,Sun May 10 18:11:29 2015 UTC,"Well, Southern California, has not hit the mark for needed rainfall since before 2007. Look how much rainfall one El Nino could produce and anyone would see it's not nearly enough to make up for almost a decade of sub-par rainfall. It would take 3 monsoon-like El Ninos to help Southern California catch up.  Have your hopes, just don't hold your breath.  http://www.latimes.com/science/sciencenow/la-sci-sn-el-nino-rain-20150304-story.html  http://www.citylab.com/weather/2014/07/to-end-californias-drought-more-than-1-foot-of-rain-needs-to-fall-in-a-month/374587/"
orangecounty,35gjhw,mtux96,1 point,Sun May 10 21:48:51 2015 UTC,"One good elnino is a start and whatever after that would be a good catch up. But let's assume like you want to propose that we will have this drought for 20 years, I think worrying about a single water park isn't going to matter much as we'd run out of water at some point and it's going to be more than a single water park putting us there. If this is the case, then we need to start an exodus out of California as there will not be enough water for the state."
orangecounty,35gjhw,cj5,1 point,Sun May 10 22:52:35 2015 UTC,"Well, first off, I am not proposing a guaranteed 20 year drought. Second, there's a huge gap between this drought being done and gone in a year, like you proposed, and 20 years.  You're right, being ultra-conservative about water isn't really going to help, especially since it is cycled out of reclamation faster than it is replenished. California has a huge population (a bulk of it in the driest areas of the state). An exodus wouldn't be such a bad idea. There's simply too much demand, in places that cannot support it. Southern California was never meant to carry such a large population, especially in an arid climate like it has. The water isn't here, so we have to draw it from elsewhere in the state.  Another issue with population, is wash systems in SoCal. They are very bad for the environment, especially when you consider that they are meant to draw away from population centers, so as to not wash them away when mountain run off occurs. So, what you have is water, that was once naturally filtrated back into the low-lying valleys that were once less populated, if even populated at all. This replenished the soil with water needed to keep the water tables higher, and keep the greater part of the land wet. Instead, at some point it was more desirable to funnel all this runoff water into artificial rivers, that sent all that fresh water to the ocean, bypassing the land. Therefore making it very dry, and forcing us to use water from elsewhere to water our lawns, wash, and drink."
orangecounty,35gjhw,mtux96,1 point,Mon May 11 00:46:59 2015 UTC,"Well if anything, a good el nino will help and will probably set us up well for the future ahead. It will probably mean that stupid pressure system that was hanging out along our coast which blocked us from getting a lot of storms moved on. But I don't believe it is as dire as it seems right now. It doesn't mean I think we should be wasting water though."

orangecounty,35fzif,hoopera,2,Sun May 10 00:00:21 2015 UTC,"There is a doubletree in orange that I stay at each time now. It is at the intersection of the 5 and state college. The price has been much better than the convention center hotels (by a lot) and it is close enough to be convenient.   This is the address:  100 The City Dr S Orange, CA  92868-3204 United States  I would recommend visiting sunset, Huntington or Newport beaches. The mission at San juan Capistrano and enjoying some of the excellent food that oc has to offer.   I would say: tasty noodle house (Irvine), Mick's karma bar (Irvine) and oscars Cuban (not sure that this is correct) in the orange circle and brodards in garden grove are must visits and not expensive. I would also say that if you have a splurge meal planned you cannot beat some of the excellent sushi places. Let me know if that is on your list and I will give recommendations.   Disneyland is expensive, there are no real deals to be had. Knots berry farm is fun, but filthy. More adult, but lacks the charm and wonder that Disneyland has to offer. Universal studios is much less expensive and close enough to drive, six flags magic mountain is further, but still easy to do, and les than Disney."

I do however, LOVE sushi. Would love to hear some recommendations!  Actually, I checked the prices for the Double Tree, and it looks like it's gonna be about $240 per night for the days around the con. That sucks, because it looks insanely nice. BUT, VidCon's website offers hotel rooms at a discounted price. I can get a room at the Clarion for $138 a night (a little over $500 for the whole thing). That's not bad at all for me! I could also get a room at Red Lion for about $157 a night. Both of which are within less than half a mile of the convention center.  I might go to the beach on my first day. However, we don't really have beaches in the Midwest, so I'm not sure what I would do there. I guess I could walk around, but I do love to ride JetSki's on the lake sometimes.  Thanks for your tips! They're extremely helpful :D"

A good place to start is  www.bwrnewport.com ...make sure you are looking at yearly leases, alot of the units down here go on summer rental period so you have to move out every 9 months!  If you mean the costamesa/newport area then you want to stay away from the Coronado apartments, bunch of trailer trash and party kids pulling fire alarms at all hours of the night  newport coast area is nice, wouldnt call it "" down town"".

Good selection there and great prices on booze and food. Everywhere else is overpriced here. Yard House has an ok selection of beer but way overpriced and dave and busters is a joke.

Buy ads from Google and FB, make sure SongKick and BandsInTown have your schedules. Dead-tree formats are next to useless.   All that said, I know you have to do it anyway for work. Try taking stuff to The Lab and to Camp accross the street. Most shops there will help you out and hit your target demo. Hit the community college campus flyer boards.

Walking distance (real walking distance its actually litterly quicker to walk than drive) to all restaraunts bars groceries etc. Apartment is also right at the main pool with lil cabanas. Gated community. For all these reasons I do not want to lose my apartment. However I am heading to Boston for the summer for bussiness and don't feel like paying two rents all summer. My apartment is VERY sought after so it will be gone the day it's put up.  However maybe you can move in fir the summer and beyond if you feel like it while I'm gone. It would be me and my fiance though. She goes to UCI and I am.a software guy. If interested I'll run it by her.

Also, if you have the fastrak transponder, you get a $1 discount per toll so the 133 comes out to $1.73 in the morning (nothing like the $6 for the 73.)"

orangecounty,350vb4,nubckaes,4,Wed May 6 05:28:42 2015 UTC,You are right in general elections but to get the democratic nomination he needs Cali.
orangecounty,350vb4,Hamster_S_Thompson,5,Wed May 6 14:45:57 2015 UTC,"California is too late in the primary schedule to make sense as a focus for his efforts. He needs to show people he's viable in places like Iowa or hell, any of the Super Tuesday states before he can worry about primaries in June. California's organization can wait until after he's made sure the earlier states are at least something of a contest."
orangecounty,350vb4,nubckaes,3,Wed May 6 16:47:24 2015 UTC,"Yeah,  the California primary is too late to make much difference.   What you will be able to do is phone bank, calling voters in states with earlier primaries. It's hard work,  but it pays dividends.   And Bernie will need money,  and every little bit helps.   Nevada's caucus was a big help to Obama in 2008, you may be able to help out there.   And of course, talk to upper friends and family, let them know why you think Bernie's voice need to be heard.  Just ask them to listen."

orangecounty,34zy5m,mskillens,2,Wed May 6 02:58:34 2015 UTC,"Busway lanes are more practical because it's unlikely that people will walk to train stations in the middle of the freeway. At least with a bus you can have the buses go to UCI or SNA or whatever off the 405.  Also, it costs way less."

So back when I was a freshman at Dana Hills, I volunteered to be the ""teen coach"" for the Varsity Baseball team. Mr. Barragan was the Varsity baseball coach at that time (2002). It was PE Credits, and I basically was a coaches assistant, helping setting up the pitching machines, getting things ready for drills, and other stuff for practices and games.  He had invited me to go to an Angels game with him a few times during the semester. I think I might have went to two games, definitely one. I just thought he was being a cool coach. Looking back (I'm 27 now), I thought it was kind of weird for this older guy to take me, a freshman, to a baseball game, alone, just me and him. Now this article comes out and I am jaw dropped.

The city is located on U.S. Route 101 on the shores of Humboldt Bay, 270 miles (430 km) north of San Francisco and 100 miles (160 km) south of the Oregon border.  At the 2010 census, the population of the city was 27,191,  and the population of Greater Eureka   was 45,034.   Eureka is the largest coastal city between San Francisco and Portland,  and the westernmost city of more than 25,000 residents in the 48 contiguous states.   It is the regional center for government, health care, trade, and the arts on the North Coast north of the San Francisco Bay Area. Greater Eureka, one of California's major commercial fishing ports, is the location of the largest deep water port between San Francisco and Coos Bay, a stretch of about 500 miles (800 km).  The headquarters of both the Six Rivers National Forest and the North Coast Redwoods District of the California State Parks System are in Eureka. As entrepôt for hundreds of lumber mills that once existed in the area, the city played a leading role in the historic West Coast lumber trade. The entire city is a state historic landmark, which has hundreds of significant Victorian homes, including the nationally-recognized Carson Mansion, and the city has retained its original 19th century commercial core as a nationally-recognized Old Town Historic District.  Eureka is home to California's oldest zoo, the Sequoia Park Zoo.

It's not busy-body HOA or neighbors.  It's generally about having a body that upholds a shared view of what properly maintained living spaces are in your community.  The trick is to either avoid them or find one that shares your values.  As a general rule, they do a pretty good job of keeping a neighborhood looking good, which enhances property values."

Like I said, I don't judge or blame those who want to live in an HOA to maintain property values by strict enforcement of homogeneous standards.

The quality is excellent and they're always on time.  I don't know how serious you are about pictures, but one BIG thing that will help your costco prints is making sure color autocorrect is set to OFF. It ruins your pictures. If you order online I believe this option is at the top of the page before the final ordering screen. Not sure if you go in person but you can ask the photo lab tech.   Also if you are doing post-processing in Lightroom you can download color profiles for that exact printer at that exact costco so you can softproof correctly.   Give it a try again, I've been printing there over a year in sizes from 4x6 to 20x16."

Something that shouts to the world ""I LOVE THIS GIRL!""  For example, a friend of mine proposed over the loud-speaker on a flight to Playa Del Carmen recently.  That is a 10 in my book.  Other things that would be great are having a hidden camera or photographer.  Or setting up a neat after-party with friends and family to celebrate.  None of these things HAVE to be pricey.

Based on your grammar both in title and body of post, are you native to the US? The reason I ask is if you are not, is your SO? If she isnt, you may want to look into what the traditional marriage proposal looks like for her/your national origin.  Most women have envisioned their proposal/wedding day for many years, usually it starts when they are young and see friends/family getting married or hear of the story of their parents.....so keep that in mind, if her culture says the proposal should happen during the day vs at night, in a certain month of the year, on one knee/both/standing/sitting....those are the things she will appreciate.  In terms of romantic location....this is easy in Southern California. Any beach/cliff overlooking the beach in laguna at sunset will  work fine. You can also look into http://theflowerfields.com/ very pretty but make sure you go at the right time of the year. We also have wonderful scenery in the mountain areas such as big bear or in the desert such as joshua tree...(lots of stars etc).  You may also want to make a seperate post here looking for a photographer...you would have this person waiting ( a little bit away from you two) ready to take photos as you get down on one knee etc...etc.. she will want these photos(trust me)  GOOD LUCK!"

orangecounty,34rm2d,pandasaurusrex,2,Mon May 4 05:32:35 2015 UTC,"Laguna's weird.  Dogs are allowed all day right now.  Once that peak season hits (June-September), dogs aren't allowed at any part of the day.  The other beach cities, by and large, have hourly restrictions.  For instance, in Newport Beach, no dogs are allowed on the beach from 10am-4:30pm.  Before or after that you're good to go.  Dogs are supposed to be on leash pretty much everywhere, but they'll usually leave you alone if you're within the right time frame to be there."
orangecounty,34rm2d,pandasaurusrex,1 point,Mon May 4 04:57:49 2015 UTC,"I've noticed that while looking around for places, that many beaches only allow dogs on leash after 4-5, which I find very odd."
orangecounty,34rm2d,tinapasadena,2,Mon May 4 05:33:17 2015 UTC,"The logic is to allow for dogs on the beach when most people would be off of work, so they can take their dogs out.  It's off limits during the day because that's when the moms with their little kids come out to play."
orangecounty,34rm2d,Sportyj,1 point,Mon May 4 05:53:40 2015 UTC,I guess that makes sense. I'm just going to have to research and note these times so I don't come home from my trip with a few tickets.

It's more of an issue on the week ends or at the state parks.  So as long as you hit up beach areas that you know are dog friendly, you'll be good."

orangecounty,34mnh3,autowikibot,3,Sat May 2 18:34:50 2015 UTC,"June Gloom:       June Gloom is a southern California term for a weather pattern that results in cloudy, overcast skies with cool temperatures during the late spring and early summer, most commonly in the month of June. Low-altitude stratus clouds are formed over the ocean, then transported over the coastal regions by the wind.  The overcast skies often are accompanied by fog and drizzle, though usually not rain.  June Gloom in southern California is caused by the marine layer effect common to the West Coast,  and is enhanced by the Catalina eddy local to southern California. May and June together are usually the cloudiest months in coastal Southern California.  June Gloom has other colloquial names if the same weather pattern occurs in May, July, or August. June Gloom is stronger in years associated with a La Niña, and weaker or nonexistent in years with an El Niño. This weather pattern occurs in other parts of the world where climates and conditions are similar.  Scientists study the cloud fields that make up June Gloom to increase understanding of cloud behavior at the onset of drizzle and precipitation.

orangecounty,34mnh3,DDotJ,2,Sat May 2 20:45:02 2015 UTC,"The weather is quite pleasant right now, warm summer weather. Temperatures are about 72 F, which is 22 C. Not humid at all, the heat from the sun is what makes it hot. So if you're standing in direct sunlight, you will get really hot. But if you're standing in the shade with a cool breeze blowing, it will be pretty cool and pleasant. It was pretty hot the past few days with temperatures in the 90's (35 C) but has cooled off significantly.  You most likely won't notice the drought situation, especially if you are here just on a holiday. Maybe just a sign or sticker on a mirror reminding you to conserve water.  And others here have mentioned June gloom, in my experience living in NB for about 12+ years, it does occur, but it's not consistent (it's occasionally gloomy, but not every day). Usually starts off with the morning being a bit foggy, but it goes away by noon. There's still plenty of sunshine. July technically more of the sunny and hot summer weather that California is known for, but June is perfectly fine. I've been to the beach in June, and it's perfectly enjoyable.

orangecounty,34g57h,Fatt_Rascal,3,Fri May 1 02:22:38 2015 UTC,"This is a question for /r/askcarsales  I'll save you some time and money and give you the answer in a nutshell: Don't use a broker. It's a waste of money. Usually their fee will be $500-$1000 and the price they negotiate isn't all that great. Source: I work in the business.  Here is what you need to do: 1) Research cars and narrow it down to what you want. Do homework online, go test drive cars on dealer lots, etc. While you're out test driving, make a relationship with a salesperson/manager at your local dealer that sells the brand you decide on. Once you decide on exactly which car you want to buy, 2) Go on www.truecar.com and get a price quote by building the vehicle you want. Make sure to build it exactly as you want it, i.e. with the correct packages & options. This will give you an accurate and attainable quote. TrueCar is, 9 times out of 10, as good as it gets. It works by having several dealers 'bid' at once for your quote. Then, 3) Go back to your local dealer and meet with the salesperson/manager you talked to when you test drove. Give them your printed TrueCar quote for the car you want, and buy or lease it at that price!  If you want any financing/leasing advice, feel free to ask. But, the above is the best advice for getting an excellent price on the car you want with minimal hassle."
orangecounty,34g57h,stickyrubber,3,Fri May 1 17:21:31 2015 UTC,"Truecar is awesome. I bought a car last year... Once I new exactly what I wanted, I got the quote from truecar. I printed it out and went to a dealer who was not even on the truecar quote... They matched the price without even thinking about it.  If you have a trade in, go to carmax a few days before you intend to buy/trade-in... Let them inspect your car and they will give you a quote to buy your car. This quote is good for about a week. When I went to trade in my car at the dealership, they offered me hardly anything. But, once I showed them the carmax quote, they matched that also (5x above the dealers original offer to me)"
orangecounty,34g57h,Fatt_Rascal,1 point,Fri May 1 19:45:14 2015 UTC,Yep. CarMax should be everyone's baseline for trade-in value. I recommend my customers go there all the time.

Just cross reference their quotes with TrueCar/Edmunds but those have become dealer friendly according to some people I have spoken to.  A broker won't get you as good a deal as you would get hustling and emailing multiple dealers but they are convenient.  They will often beat truecar.

And of course, only few of them will be under invoice. There are two reasons to hire an auto broker: save time and save money. Good brokers know the bottom line prices, which include discounts, rebates, incentives, etc. When people negotiate themselves they do not know the number they can reach. A dealership can offer you to pay 450 per month, and you can negotiate to 400, while in reality you could have gotten 350. That is why it is nice to have a good broker. That being said, of course you can do everything yourself and invest time in research and running around dealerships. You can do a lot of things yourself: change oil, rotate tires, wash your car, etc. All depends on how much you value your time."
orangecounty,34g57h,Panauto,0,Fri May 1 18:56:55 2015 UTC,"Pure ignorance. My TrueCar price on a new Hyundai Sonata is $1,500 under dealer invoice right now; and that is before taking off the factory rebates. And, by the way, all of the available rebates are listed on both the manufacturer website AND on Truecar.com. You don't need a middle-man to tell you what they are.  Again, brokers charge $500-$1000. So, if you want to pay at least $500-$1000 too much for your new car, go through a broker. Usually it is worse than that though, because the broker has a kick-back deal worked out with the dealership he refers his clients to, and the dealer has to charge you an even higher price to cover the kick-back. Basically, the broker is making a commission on you AND on the dealer. It's a racket."
orangecounty,34g57h,Fatt_Rascal,1 point,Fri May 1 19:51:12 2015 UTC,"n a new Hyundai Sonata   I agree, there are certain models that are ""being sold"" under the invoice. You brought the perfect example. Total discounts on Sonata are shown to be around 4K, but a broker can get you around 7. Neither manufacture nor truecar.com list all available rebates and discounts. Dealerships get leads from truecar!!! They would not shoot themselves in the foot by showing the absolute bottom price. It especially applies to luxury models. To be fair, brokers are not hired to buy Sonatas and Civics. Most of our customers look for cars over 50K.  Most recent example: Jaguar XF 2.0. MSRP: 51K, Invoice 48K. Average paid; 49K. None!!! of the clients would ever get a Jag with only 3K discount off MSRP. That will be Jaguar's wet dream. 36 month lease with 10K!!!! due at signing and 359 per month? Yeah right. I have yet to find a customer who is willing to shell out 10K due at signing for a Jag. And those are awesome truecar numbers."

Every other speed test site and our actual usage shows us typically getting under 1Mbps/download and around 300Kbps/upload.   Previously, I had Verizon FIOS before we moved. FIOS was superior in every way, and consistently met the speeds which we were sold.  As soon as there's a viable alternative, Uverse can suck it.  Also, it's worth pointing out that Uverse is NOT fiber to the home, like FIOS and Google Fiber. It's fiber to the neighborhood. The last bit of your connection is still going through the old wiring that's likely been there since your neighborhood was built, and which wasn't designed for high speed data transfer. The ATT salesman likely won't tell you that, and will pretend that the fiber service that they're selling is comparable to FIOS/Google Fiber. It isn't."

Anyway after about a day, I couldn't stand it anymore, went to COX got a nice 12 month promotion that was more expensive than the ATT deal and had internet before the end of the same day. Canceled my ATT immediately and got my cancellation number. Perfect.  Two weeks later my internet stopped working. Called COX, they sent someone over, some idiot had unplugged the COX cable and plugged in the ATT cable (wonder who would do such a thing). Then two weeks after that I received a DSL modem, and got charged 100 dollars. You can tell I don't have many good memories from ATT.  All I'll say is this, sometimes paying a bit more is worth it.....COX isn't perfect and they're pricey but at least it works (mostly) until someone else comes along.....GOOGLE PLEASE :("

orangecounty,34a7up,Trying2BaWiseGuy,5,Wed Apr 29 15:12:09 2015 UTC,"I have only recently moved to Mission Viejo, but when this issue came up I contacted her in March just to see what Pat Bates would say as I was expecting an immediate dismissal from her (granted I knew very little about her and was basing my opinion on perceived bias). I have actually talked to my neighbors and many of them had simply assumed their senator would vote against it. A few of my neighbors have now gone out of their way to contact her after simply hearing from me that she was actually on the fence. So if you live in her area don't just contact her, go the extra mile I tell your neighbors and friends. I think many liberals will find their conservative neighbors in the area are actually big supporters of vaccinations especially the older ones were around when or whose parents told them about whooping cough and measles. Even then, telling people is important, whether you support or oppose this bill everyone's voices should be heard in regards to something so important.  This was the response she sent me back on March 9th:   Thank you for your correspondence regarding vaccinations. I appreciate you contacting me on this very important issue. Existing law requires students of any public or private elementary/secondary school, child care center, and other facilities to be fully immunized against various diseases, including measles prior to his or her admission. The law also currently allows exemptions for medical reasons or personal beliefs.  As you know, Senate Bill 277 would eliminate the vaccination exemption based on personal belief, but it would still allow for medical exceptions. This bill was prompted partly because of the spread of measles in Southern California last December, when at least 40 people contracted the disease. The outbreak has now spread to at least half a dozen other states.  This is a difficult issue for me as there are equally compelling priorities to consider – ensuring public health and protecting individual choice. Over the past few weeks I have received passionate appeals from supporters and opponents alike on SB 277, citing one priority as taking precedence over the other.  Supporters have made compelling arguments about having more people vaccinated to prevent outbreaks like the one last December. The science is indeed clear that vaccinations have dramatically reduced diseases that were once widely feared.  For example, California reported 59 confirmed measles cases, and the U.S. reported 644 in 2014, the most in a quarter-century. In 2012, the U.S. had its biggest whooping cough epidemic since 1955. Nearly 50,000 Americans contracted the disease, which caused 20 deaths – mostly infants under three months. These increases coincided with plunging vaccination rates.  Opponents of SB 277 have also made compelling arguments about giving people the choice as to what goes into the bodies of their children. I have heard from many that they are not opposed to vaccines, just to the notion that the government can require them, especially if they believe vaccines may harm their children.  I am sympathetic to such concerns as I believe there should be strong limits on government. However, when it comes to vaccines, the impact of one’s decision to not vaccinate is not confined to that person – it affects the greater community by putting neighbors, including children, at risk of being infected with preventable diseases.  Thankfully, the scientific evidence also shows that not every individual has to be vaccinated in order to achieve “herd immunity” from such diseases. However, in order to ensure such immunity, an overwhelming majority of the population must be vaccinated. That is why I support tightening the personal belief exemption, but not eliminating it entirely.  Given our nation’s constitutional guarantee of the freedom of religion, exemptions should still be granted for those with legitimate faith-based concerns. If the bill includes these exemptions, it is a bill that I could probably support. However, the first draft of SB 277 eliminates faith-based exemptions entirely, which I cannot support.  As with any legislative proposal, the devil is in the details and I will withhold judgment on SB 277 until a final version is presented to me for a vote.  Once again, thank you for your correspondence. If I can be of further assistance on this or any other state-related matter, please do not hesitate to contact me. It is an honor to represent you in the 36 th Senate District.  Sincerely,  PATRICIA C. BATES Senator, 36 th District"
orangecounty,34a7up,Boomsome,2,Wed Apr 29 21:22:18 2015 UTC,"Interesting! Thank you for including her response.  Honestly, this doesn't mean she's a definite no. Rather, it means she's trying to use religious freedom as an excuse for voting no, thus quelling the protests of anti-vaxxers.  For those who call her, I think the point to raise with her, then, is that both the US Constitution and the California Constitution put public safety above religious freedom--with good reason. We don't allow human sacrifices, for example, but that impedes religious freedom.  I'd encourage you to call her office again and perhaps stress that point, indicating that you respect religious freedoms (if it's a phone call, they may not realize you're the same person). Federal court cases have affirmed that interpretation, too.  It's also worth noting that a VERY few religions object to vaccines, but that doesn't make for a compelling argument.  Edit: I updated my post to include this as a tip for what to say."

Not giving the people the option to not vaccininate their children, regardless if the vaccines are ""currently"" known to not cause any immediate harm, is anti-thought at best, and leading into a culture where governmental restriction is expected. What of the cases of the spinal inflammation and resulting paralysis that can be observed (and known) for be caused by many of the vaccines the bill lists? What of those with bodies that react sensitively to those vaccines (and are more likely to find themselves faced with the very real situation of the above condition)?  I'm all for ""herd immunity,"" but ending the choice for a family to responsibly choose to not to vaccinate their child is ... seriously wrong.  After seeing you brigade many other California reddits with your opinions, I will express mine: this bill is not what any parent who has a child (such as one with that of a medical condition which a vaccine could trigger an auto-immune response of quite serious proportion) nor of any parent who values the ability to trust the their own decisions.  I will happily call Mrs. Bates to express my opinion on the matter."

orangecounty,34a7up,plastikmissile,6,Wed Apr 29 21:21:42 2015 UTC,Some kids can't get vaccinated for medical reasons. They often have comprimised immune systems. You're putting those kids at serious risk for no legitimate reason.
