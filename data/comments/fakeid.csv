fakeid,3e48qc,tniemuth95,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:05:46 2015 UTC,"All depends on the place.  Each bar has their own standards for door guys.  Some places like their door guys to be have massive football player-esque bodies while some places like to have scrawny white kids be their door guys.  It all depends on what the owner wants.  The best way to get a job is to get your foot in the door.  Apply for literally every position they're offering.  If it means being a dishwasher for a couple weeks to eventually move on up, so be it."

People say FYD WA is instate passable but this looks so much better. A couple of things, the color for the blue font of Sex, Wgt, etc looks too light of a blue, but that could just be the picture. Also, the signature on WA IDs usually ends up going over part of the person's picture.

I knew a couple, but none of them made the kind of quality I was looking for. I decided check out a DNM, Silk Road 2. During my research for reviews and such, I found this sub and started asking questions and trying to find reliable, quality vendors.    I decided to be a part of it, because I saw the potential for growth and the kind of resources this community would provide as it grew bigger and bigger. I stuck around, contributed information regarding laws, enforcement procedure, the social aspects of using fakes, etc. After a while, Reddings saw me as a valuable member and made me an Honorary Mod.    As far as contributions to the userbase, I haven't really done anything besides offer informational support and aid in making this a safer place to find reliable vendors."

The ID is tested using infrared lighting techniques to check template accuracy. This is why there have been rumors of really good old NC's passing the dreaded box scanner.   If it's not a box scanner it's then some sort of advanced scanner or less. The barcode or mag strip of the ID is scanned/swiped and tested on the encoded information. Barzapp like you mentioned is checking for age, gender, name, etc...but mainly if the Information on the ID is encoded following the state specific guidelines(which holds a mass amount of invisible characters and symbols)"

It's not that hard to find out exactly how they work and how to appease them.  I'd like for us to have our own software-based box scanner (not impossible at all, as long as we have the brains) to help vendors QA their PDF417's.  After all, it would behoove us to know enough about this to create our own scanner.  The tricky part is that we need state-specific knowledge, and can't just rely on AAMVA and ANSI standards.  Many states are not standards-compliant at all.  I found a resource that has intel on barcode specifics by all 50 states, compiled officially by members of the industry.

At the end of the night drink a few glasses of water. Now obviously if you're blackout drunk then you likely blacked out before water was an option. When you wake up you need to drink gatorade as that'll help hydrate and get electrolytes in your body as well as providing some carbs for your body to work off of. Also, you're not gonna want to at all, but eating WILL definitely help. Occasionally you might have heard people talk about sweating off a hangover so you could go for a jog or something like that depending on how bad it is. The WORST thing you can do is stay in bed all day after. It'll prolong your hangover. I like to stay inside and chill till like 1 or 2 (pm), but after I have to get out and go do something.

I’ll have you know my name is John, and I woke up this morning 5:30 sharp to the smell of wet pussy. I was getting a blowjob from two bitches (Shit was SO Cash), one was trying to fit my humongous 3 pound balls in her mouth while the other was choking halfway on my 18 and 3\8 inch dick. She started to squirt hard, she was convulsing and having 6 orgasms at the same time. I gave it to them and they were on the floor squirting like motherfucking fountains. Must have come about a quart of sperm and compressed air. Imagine your best orgasm, then multiply it by 35. I had to go to base camp so I front-flipped from my 14th floor barracks into my valet parked 2012 Ferrari (I got connexions). Pushed my shit to about 4 hundo (mph, mind you) and I was at base camp in no time. When I entered, I became a top sniper and was granted access to the entire arsenal of the USMC. I learned how to kill someone in over 700 different ways and was assigned to be the leader of a squad that will kill 300 terrorists using gorilla warfare tactics. Also did 6000 push-ups, 8000 sit-ups and bench-pressed 30 plates in 16 minutes. After basic training, I met a network of secret spies who will help me trace your IP address, while eating gold plated sushi and 15,000 $ champagne. My unit got the rest of the day off and I became captain of our base’s football team and starter of the basketball team. I got straight A’s on the military entrance exams and received more awards. Meanwhile, you were jacking off to pictures on Facebook and naked drawn Japanese people. Went back in the Lambo to my barracks and now I am getting ready to go to sleep. I am going to graduate at the top of my class in the Navy Seals tomorrow and I want to look pretty much perfect for it.

fakeid,3e0nq9,NoItsNotMySisters,2,Tue Jul 21 01:37:11 2015 UTC,he's selling again. He just made a thread a couple days ago. He's offering both his pink ohio and the new blue ohio with old oh holos.
fakeid,3e0nq9,cokecola123,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:38:08 2015 UTC,$250...........* sign *

fakeid,3e0nq9,Fakeaddress34,2,Tue Jul 21 01:41:00 2015 UTC,"yep. Quick turn around isn't a common thing in the fake id world, so any established vendor who can offer it can charge basically any price, especially when it's coupled with ted's cs. I probbaly sound shilly as fuck right now, but honestly ted's cs is a new level. I had an issue with my first order that he could have easily brushed off, but instead offered up a very fair deal and since then has always been a quality vendor. Plus he's one of the funniest vendors on here next to Scannable and House of Fakes."

fakeid,3e0nq9,IceIceDanky,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:38:05 2015 UTC,In DonJon inc. we are always bringing new ideas to the game of Fake ID's and we wanted to know if people would like to receive their ID’s in around 2 business days. My current crew is ready to start working and believe that they can produce it in an astonishing time guaranteeing it’s arrival in less than 3 days. This service will come with a greater price but with the same care and quality control as the other orders. Prices for the Perfect TX with this service will be of $250 (when placing your order mention that you want the flash shipping beside the state)   https://www.reddit.com/r/fakeid/comments/3b811n/donjonfakes_4th_of_july_promotion/

I would say his OH is on par with most of the other Oh vendors minus ted, so not great, but not the worst out their (although none of them can get that pink fade right, so they all look either too dark and red, or way to pink. OH is a very subtle pink that transitions to white from left to middle and right to middle."
fakeid,3e058f,Crappy_IDs,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:28:28 2015 UTC,His OH has the worst faux micro ever. Those lines are giant. I'd be surprised to hear his IL has actual micro
fakeid,3e058f,cokecola123,2,Mon Jul 20 23:48:46 2015 UTC,i think so at least. I think i remember seeing him offering pre-printed microprint pvc cards for IL.   I might also be over judging his IL due to Il's reputation. So even semi-decent ILs look like shit to me.

fakeid,3dzz12,catejanedo,2,Mon Jul 20 22:09:33 2015 UTC,Haven't seen a full Ted review in awhile. Thanks
fakeid,3dzz12,Crappy_IDs,2,Mon Jul 20 22:14:49 2015 UTC,"well he was on summer vacation for 30 days. Plus i think a lot of users stop posting reviews due to the inital high volume of reviews (you get the mentality like ""i don't need to post a review, everyone knows his ids are beautiful, plus so many other people post reviews. Social loafing at its best, and yes i know it's not really social loafing :P)"
fakeid,3dzz12,cokecola123,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:36:14 2015 UTC,He also had a thread where people would post reviews but never pictures and frankly a picture is better than any review anyone has ever posted here
fakeid,3dzz12,Crappy_IDs,2,Mon Jul 20 22:46:34 2015 UTC,"true, pics show way more than most reviews, especially because a lot of reviews are made by newer buyers. So even if they get an id that isn't that great they often go ""wow i could never tell the difference between this and a real"", having never seen that state's real. I know i posted a comparison of my real and my ted on an old account, as did a lot of the initial buyers/reviews. Those reviews really helped cement Ted's ids as some of the top notch around here, and especially the best OH fake by far."
fakeid,3dzz12,cokecola123,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:48:36 2015 UTC,I'd really like to see the UV and the microprint on a Ted ID. The pics I've seen are pretty good but people always just focus on the holos
fakeid,3dzz12,Crappy_IDs,2,Mon Jul 20 22:57:36 2015 UTC,"https://www.reddit.com/r/fakeid/comments/2soe81/ted_ohio_review/   this one has a decent comparison. Ted's uv is duller for sure, but it's clearer than all the other OH vendors based off of the reviews i've seen. Real OH's UV's are just unbelievably bright, so when compared directly the difference can be shocking."
fakeid,3dzz12,cokecola123,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:00:28 2015 UTC,You are a scholar and a gentleman. Thanks. Looks like Ted has the same UV problems as all the other fake OH IDs I've seen lately
fakeid,3dzz12,Crappy_IDs,2,Mon Jul 20 23:05:00 2015 UTC,"No problem. Just want to help the community out when i can.   It for sure could be better, but at least it's clear (my photos were pretty bad due to my uv light not reacting well with my phone's camera). Compared to say an idgod OH, the state seal uv on my ted is 110% clearer, just a bit too dull compared to a real id."
fakeid,3dzz12,cokecola123,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:11:22 2015 UTC,Every OH fake I've seen has the UV offset from the holos or whatever that state outline is.
fakeid,3dzz12,Crappy_IDs,2,Mon Jul 20 23:18:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah that's a common thing. I've been through 3 ted's (not through necessarily, but the first had a color issue with my photo, then i ordered another 2, one as my main and one as a dupe). My main had a perfect line up with the state outline and UV, the dupe was off by just a tinge. It comes from having to hand apply the Holos post UV printing. Plus MM on an id seems like a ton of space, so even if the holo and UV are off by 1-2 MMs, it looks like they're off by miles."
fakeid,3dzz12,cokecola123,2,Mon Jul 20 23:20:07 2015 UTC,now just don't use this information for evil (or at least be nice when you do).

fakeid,3dzz12,hideintrees,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:46:19 2015 UTC,Not totally sure what I can divulge here but the envelope is nothing out of the ordinary. You'll know when you see it.
fakeid,3dzz12,cokecola123,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:25:23 2015 UTC,Oh yeah sorry my question sounded a little sketchy haha. My school just has separate systems for letter envelopes that fit in a 2x2 mailbox that you can retrieve on your own and larger envelopes that you would have to go pick up at the package center. It would just save me a lot of time if I knew how big the envelope is because then I wouldn't have to go keep checking my mailbox and I could just wait for an email from the package center. But no worries haha I'll just wait it out

I'm exercising my right to the fifth amendment.  so if they ask you any questions plead the 5th (don't say anything).   That only applies when your under arrest.   Most of the time they strong arm and intimidate people into confessing.   No, they dont. They probably don't care too much quite honestly.   Source: I fucking hate cops   You're admittedly biased and predisposed to assume the police are all bad people.   I... have dealt with bullshit kinda like this before.   Yeah and it sounds like you probably pissed off some cops by not even knowing when or how to properly invoke your rights."
fakeid,3e0c2d,good-afternoon,0,Tue Jul 21 00:15:43 2015 UTC,"1) Sure, I guess you worded it oddly or maybe I misread. No big deal  2) The 5th amendment is known as the 'rights of the accused.' If you're not being accused of a crime, those rights don't apply and you can not invoke them. You staying silent is simply your right to free speech, or the lack thereof.  3) It's relatively rare that cops will do this, especially when dealing with such a small crime like this.  4) Your hatred of cops means you make biased statements. (see #3)  5) You didn't properly invoke your rights. You probably just acted like an asshole in a situation instead of staying calm and being mature about it.  No, I'm getting my undergrad degree at one of the best schools in the nation."

Not as bad as asking about 3 day turnaround, but hoping i could get a week-1.5 week turnaround. Now i know only a few vendors can offer such service. They either need a big team and fast shipping options, or are new vendors with a low number of buyers (plus new vendors generally can only really offer one major deal sealer, and that's strong cs and quick production time)"

If you're gonna do this, you need to know what you're doing.  Be a professional.  After doing that, find barcode samples for that state, decode them, and analyze the content.  Make sure your data conforms to that state's format.  BE AWARE of AAMVA and ANSI's guidelines, but also be aware that states don't always choose to follow them.  If you know how the state does it, do it that way.  If you don't, fall back on AAMVA and ANSI, but it would behoove you to get yourself some samples."

fakeid,3dwag6,Crappy_IDs,7,Mon Jul 20 01:51:55 2015 UTC,The current Greek system of hazing originates from world war two when young men went to basic training. They were degraded to the point that they respected their elders and didn't question their orders.  It's about breaking someone down mentally so that they will follow you and join you in your mission. Or brotherhood. Or so I was told while questioning hazing

fakeid,3dusbd,WeIdon,0,Sun Jul 19 19:07:27 2015 UTC,I've done the math and gross profit is about 8.5 million per year. That is a semi-rough estimate though. Its potentially 10-12 mill or more per year.
fakeid,3dusbd,IDFakeThatCSRep,3,Sun Jul 19 19:11:03 2015 UTC,I've done the math   6th grade math yay
fakeid,3dusbd,dumb_acct,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:13:01 2015 UTC,"that 8.5 million would just be his gross profit, not what he actually makes. im guessing you calculated that figure as his revenue minus the cost of goods sold (ie. the cost of materials and labor per id).  IDGod also spends money on developing new states, although this cost is probably just a drop or tow in the bucket for him. He also spends money on purchasing/upgrading/replacing printers and other equipment. again, this cost probably isn't too significant to IDgod. He then also surely has people in management/taskmaster/supervisor roles making sure everything is running smoothly on the production floor, everyone is doing their job properly, and any hitches in production do not snowball and cause a factory-wide problem. He then also either pays rent or has purchased space for his factory. This is cost that is more that just a drop in the bucket.  Also, i have no idea how things over where the god is are, but he may be paying kickbacks to certain officials or crime syndicates as what could be a kind of ""protection money"" or ""dont ask dont tell"" money.  Also, he has to pay for the electricity his factory uses (in addition to the water and gas bills). And I'm guessing he probably has to pay a premium on converting all his bitcoins to cash.  All these costs (and more i have missed) add up, so IDGod (as in the upper level management, which it seems is just one guy) is probably taking in less than 8.5 mil (im assuming you mean dolars). id guess his biggest non-operating expense is by far the premium he pays on converting his bitcoin, so his actual income depends on that and on whether he holds his bitcoin and ""plays the bitcoin market"""

fakeid,3dvbzo,QuigsFTP,0,Sun Jul 19 20:57:22 2015 UTC,Yup grab a Ted Ohio. Cost $200 for the OLD Ohio and it is one of the most faked states. /s
fakeid,3dvbzo,runnernikolai,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:31:25 2015 UTC,Yup that is an accurate summary of what I posted above
fakeid,3dvbzo,QuigsFTP,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:39:25 2015 UTC,Ohio is faked without the OVI in most cases. Ted is the only vendor that has it. Idgod uses done wierd glitter lmao.

fakeid,3dvb0v,HouseOfFakes,3,Sun Jul 19 20:40:23 2015 UTC,You posted the same thing yesterday. The bouncer was an idiot and there's nothing you can do about it.
fakeid,3dvb0v,materialbreed,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:20:36 2015 UTC,"Real ID's crease, so do fakes."
fakeid,3dvb0v,Faketossawa,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:44:19 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure what real ID you've seen that ""creases""? I've yet to encounter an authentic PVC ID laminate that creases. This is probably what the bouncer meant.  While real IDs can get folds or bends in them, the Laminate will not form a crease the same way a fake would."
fakeid,3dvb0v,Clubouncer,1 point,Mon Jul 20 10:41:47 2015 UTC,"Mississippi, Florida, technically Florida is polycarb but still it develops creases in the laminate.   For teslin states GA, MO, are both teslin states that I have seen with SEVERE creases in them."
fakeid,3dvb0v,Faketossawa,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:39:17 2015 UTC,"I'm aware that teslin can crease, however I'm almost positive this is what the bouncer meant. Here are 2 IDs from same state. Guess which is real and which one is fake.   http://imgur.com/svNoU4Y http://imgur.com/NyoljpO"

fakeid,3dva13,DiscountID,3,Sun Jul 19 20:31:35 2015 UTC,I would be incredibly interested!
fakeid,3dva13,snippythetippy,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:37:52 2015 UTC,So would I. Though I need help getting there by getting the holograms.
fakeid,3dva13,how-long-to-wait,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:07:55 2015 UTC,Sent you a PM.

fakeid,3dva13,fakes4mi,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:13:59 2015 UTC,How about a free one? Hmmm
fakeid,3dva13,fakes4mi,2,Sun Jul 19 21:17:27 2015 UTC,Counterproductive to releasing a final product.
fakeid,3dva13,spritejack234,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:41:07 2015 UTC,That's true what would your price be for one with out UV?
fakeid,3dva13,WeIdon,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:37:16 2015 UTC,Holos*
fakeid,3dva13,macmac49,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:47:24 2015 UTC,$50 without Holos. Comes with UV.
fakeid,3dva13,Sinternet,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:03:58 2015 UTC,What would the cost be? Finished and unfinished
fakeid,3dva13,PseudoMario,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:04:40 2015 UTC,$50 will get you a WA without holograms.  $100 will get you a WA with holograms when they are done.
fakeid,3dva13,WeIdon,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:06:38 2015 UTC,$50 seems steep for one without holos.

fakeid,3duifv,bchamp227,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:24:20 2015 UTC,Address should show up as far as I know. I'm from IL and have scanned real O21 ILs with BCS and it shows up.
fakeid,3duifv,Zakkour75,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:39:14 2015 UTC,"But on YOLO Illinois it doesn't, he says so on the order form. Something with them being encoded in a different way or something I don't remember."

fakeid,3duifv,IceIceDanky,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:28:53 2015 UTC,For what reasons?
fakeid,3duifv,Jerryleeid1CS,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:40:27 2015 UTC,"Fonts are off. UV is visible. Eyes should say ""BLUE"" to point out a few things"

fakeid,3duhlr,eljefe6969,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:30:17 2015 UTC,"That's what I'm worried about though...I go to school in a very small town and most of the bouncers seem like guys they just pull of the street. They usually look at the ID, squint a bit, see if it blacklights and then let you in."
fakeid,3duhlr,OneStopIDShop,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:33:05 2015 UTC,seems like a good story of why you should get in then. this is fake no uv. dude im from maine we dont have uv on our id's.

fakeid,3dv7ht,Jason14th,4,Sun Jul 19 22:29:32 2015 UTC,So are you saying you only sent me an SC at a discount so I would unknowingly forever praise you and help you achieve instate-passable ranking on the VVL with side by side photos?? I'm okay with that!

fakeid,3dv7ht,OTCIDs,4,Sun Jul 19 20:38:22 2015 UTC,I figured I should benefit the community in some way  If that is by letting them know the best SC (Southern ID in general) they can get so be it
fakeid,3dv7ht,Faketossawa,2,Sun Jul 19 21:02:54 2015 UTC,Word of mouth for me. Less risky in my opinion
fakeid,3dv7ht,Zakkour75,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:13:22 2015 UTC,As an experience business man marketing is through user experience. Yes all those little things help! BUT when it comes down to it get your customers to leave reviews and sure enough people will buy! Same goes for the real world with things like trip adviser or yelp. Statistics have shown that those have a huge influence on marketing and company success.
