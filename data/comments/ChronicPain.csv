ChronicPain,3e4tn9,zutroi67,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:32:04 2015 UTC,"Hello mate. I'm 48. Have had cervical neck facet arthritis (+ a few crumbly disks) for about 12 years now. Constant upper right-sided neck pain, bilateral headache and painful bilateral musculature around the front of my neck. Medicated with Tramadol 200 BD for years, but recently made the nasty jump to Targin 20/10. Tramadol was good, but I increasingly became tolerant to it and was taking 400 BD instead. Have been taking Lyrica or like for a few years, but these drugs make me DUMB. I'm a health professional, and these drugs have robbed me of my mind. I'm now on Sodium Valproate, which is weaker, but still helps with the headache and neck pain (a bit!) Physical therapy used to help, but at AU$100 a pop, I couldn't afford it really, and besides, it started to become ineffective. My facet pain started as a small upper right C3-C4 spot of pain and it now controls my entire life. I have become a nasty, shitty, annoying person, with no tolerance for anything challenging. I am sometimes a total asshole to my little boy and wife, and this makes me feel like shittier than shit. My marriage is about to break. I have had the same GP/doctor for 10 years. He recently turned on me when he found that my pain specialist had moved me from Tramadol to Targin. My GP now thinks I'm drug seeking, which is semi-true, as I cannot tolerate the pain some days, and without the analgesia, I would have suicided years ago. I recently paid AU$1000 to see another pain specialist here in Melbourne, who actually showed some understanding and listened to me when I complained about my medication issues (both the Targin making me feel sick and my GP angry that I had ""escalated"" to full opiates. We are now trialling Palexia, along with my other secondary drugs, while weaning off the Targin. I'm surprised the wean is going well, but today I am in hell (pain) but in good spirits mentally. I truly hope that your facet stuff doesn't worsen like mine did. On a graph, over time, my pain is just trending up and up, busting the usefulness of my medication. I swore to my wife and GP that I would NEVER use opiates (full opiates, as opposed to partial agonists like Tramadol) but I'm now fully dependent on these drugs just to survive. There is nothing to say that your pain will worsen like mine did: we're totally different people/cases. I think the only advice I can give you is maintain a good relationship with your carers, both personal and professional. I don't know where you are in the world, but I hope you have a good doctor etc. Knowing how most doctors treat chronic painers, you may need to keep your options open as far as finding another doctor. These guys either just don't know chronic pain, or they also don't want to know about chronic pain. I'll finish my rant now. Good luck!"
ChronicPain,3e2z06,DrLemniscate,6,Tue Jul 21 15:42:48 2015 UTC,"If you want to you should. But they won't know that you have them either way and you don't know if you will need them at some point in the future. What if you go there for 2 visits and it sucks and you don't have any meds leftover?  I'd say don't toss em, don't bring em in, and don't tell them you have them.   I only used to bring in the meds that my doc prescribed me to the doc that prescribed them when I was switching meds. And he still lets me keep them now for emergencies. I have to switch every 2 weeks to make the lowest dose have an effect on me. Can't wait till I'm off them and on to better management solutions."
ChronicPain,3e2z06,Halt_I_Am_Ragnar,2,Tue Jul 21 15:54:55 2015 UTC,I agree. You never know if you are going to have a bad pain day that is worse then normal. Or if your appointment gets bumped a few days and you are going to appointment for refills. Shit happens. Best to keep it and use it if you need it. You are clearly responsible about it. I don't think you should disclose it.
ChronicPain,3e2z06,Viperbunny,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:13:19 2015 UTC,Pain specialists are always on the lookout for drug seekers. ANYTHING could make them suspect you. My policy is to never mention a drug. Let them bring up opiates. If they don't give you what you need then you need a new doctor. Sorry if it sounds bitter. I've just learned that some doctors play hardball so I have to play too. (I hate opiates btw but I've been labeled as a drug seeker because I told a doc that Ambien helps my pain a lot. I thought he would find it as weird and interesting as I did. But he thought I was lying(?) and ended my prescription.)
ChronicPain,3e2z06,sandhouse,2,Tue Jul 21 17:09:19 2015 UTC,"Yep, sandhouse is pretty spot-on here. I understand OP's views on showing the establishment that we aren't necessarily hunting drugs for the sake of it, but most doctors don't give a shit (don't get me wrong, sometimes I NEED extra drugs). It's difficult to keep your mouth shut while remaining informed and self-protective. For instance, if a new doctor says ""Well, try acetaminophen for 2 weeks and see how that goes"" then most of us chronic painers are gonna think ""Hey, you know what you can do with your shitty, weak, ineffective tablets?"" Showing your hand is probably going to end in tears, unless you are on amazingly good terms with your doctor. They say it's about trust, but really, they're just worried about you eating your tablets, turning into an injecting drug user and then getting them into trouble by overdosing. That's my exact problem with my doctor, despite him treating me solely for over 10 years: he doesn't trust me.    Before I go to my doctor, I write a list of my arguments as I often forget exactly what to say when I'm there. I would include self-preservation notes on that list, so that you can counter and argue your points clearly and articulately without screwing yourself over with a slip of the tongue about what you want/need. It would be great to be able to go to your doctor and say ""Fuck doc, my pain is getting worse, and I'm losing my mind. I have thought about how peaceful it would be to hang myself, just to get an hour without pain: GIVE ME SOMETHING STRONGER AND EFFECTIVE"" but most of the time the result will be not so good!    TL;DR IMO, no, don't take the tablets, but do take a list of things you have tried previously. How you deliver your opinions about old therapies is up to you, but I wouldn't overdo it."
ChronicPain,3e2z06,zutroi67,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:18:48 2015 UTC,"Just a note on the depression - I recommend seeking out a counselor or a pain psychologist if you can. While you could get prescribed antidepressants for your pain, your pain management doc is worried about your pain symptoms, not your depression ones. You also need to make sure to actually treat the depression. And talking about how you deal with pain and the effects it has on your life with a counselor can be really helpful. Pain and depression don't have to be synonyms."
ChronicPain,3e3nw5,vegasidol,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:33:42 2015 UTC,"I can't give a lot of advice from here. Have you asked the doctor about this? Were the injections done with some sort of scan to determine where his needles were pointing? I don't have much experience with nerve block specifically but my understanding was in this day an age doctors should not be injecting things without ultrasound or some other sort of scan because they cannot definitely know where the tip of the needle is as the structures in joints are all so close together. I don't trust shoulder or knee injections done by very qualified doctors unless they are done under ultrasound. If they were done with some sort of imaging then there is a chance that despite looks they did inject the same area. My brain is not functioning well at the moment but I do know that in spinal injections they need angle the needle and things so the entry point on the skin could be different . This would be even more the case if your back happened to be bent slightly differently in the second procedure. To be honest though, you really need to talk to the doc who did them about your concerns and see what he says.  God luck with it all. Have you noticed any effect from the blocks?"
ChronicPain,3e3nw5,ninja_wifey,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:35:27 2015 UTC,"I have an appointment to talk to the doctor next Wed. I just thought I'd get anyone else's thoughts or experience with this, since I have nothing else to go by.  The Block is done with xray guidance. They have to get the anesthesia close enough to the Medial Branch nerves. I don't doubt that he actually did the procedure correct, just the wrong vertebrae. I was on the same table with the same pads in as in the first procedure the second time, so position should not have mattered.   Effects from the block(s). The first time, the dr 'hit the nerve' or I was 'really sensitive in that area'. I say it this way, because the dr didn't give me a straight answer about exactly what did happen.   The first two vertebrae hurt mildly. There as a lot of pressure and it was pretty uncomfortable. The third one (working from bottom to top, so that 'should have been T8) hurt a lot. Enough for me to vocalize an 'ouch' and a sharp electrical sensation to radiate around my rib cage to my chest. That got me pretty freaked out.  So, that block...I had some relief. I'd like to say that a couple 'golf balls sized areas' around where I had the injections felt okay after 'testing' the injection (doing regular things that cause you pain, for me - walking). But the rest of my back around that area, hurt, maybe slightly less than usual.  Knowing that going into the second block, the dr said he'd 'be more careful' around that area (in fact, looking like he missed T8 all together).  That the pain I felt the first time could have been because of the painful reaction I experienced. The rest of my back should not have hurt. The second time each injection hurt more than the first ones did, but I did not have the shooting pain around to my chest.  Testing it out that afternoon, I felt as though I got more relief than the first time. At the end of the day after exerting myself I was starting to hurt for sure, but that was hours after the block was supposed to have worn out. I was hurting but not 'paralyzing pain-hurting'. It was manageable.   It's a tough choice...whether or not to go forward. Obviously there is the trust issue. There is the pressure to go ahead and 'try' the ablation since I have met my deductible with 2 of these $5600 procedures. But there is also fear. Killing nerves in your back...knowing it 'might not work' is pretty scary.  There's a lot to think about..."
ChronicPain,3e3nw5,zutroi67,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:19:17 2015 UTC,"Hi vegasidol. The docs can use several techniques for judging positions: manually palpating and counting, or using low-power xray/fluoroscopy while positioning the needles/injections. Your scans suggest a couple of issues that the doctors could be trying to block, so your question is difficult to answer with any precision. Also, MBB's aren't necessarily definitive. I've had 6 bilateral blocks which NEVER gave me any relief from my cervical facet arthropathy. Sometimes the blocks just don't work, making judgements on forthcoming RFA's difficult. Personally, if I had never-ending money, I would have all of my cervical facet medial branches burnt off, just in hope of SOME relief! I hope you can find your answers. Good luck. (Source: I'm a longtime, experienced RN, with longtime facet joint pain.)"
ChronicPain,3e3nw5,philnoir,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:43:24 2015 UTC,"Yes, but where is the facet hypertrophy? The quote you share says that you have facet disease located everywhere in the thoracic spine.  The facet athropathy is why you're considering medial-branch neurotomy. It is an excellent tool for eliminating this aspect of back pain.   It could very well be that your severely hypertrophic facets ie, the worst arthritic facet joints, are not bilaterally symmetrical.  Your doc is working off the MRI to decide on which levels to anesthetize, and using the flouroscope to find anatomical landmarks that identify specific throacic structures.  So, ask more questions about his decisions. Why these joints? Why only 3? Etc."
ChronicPain,3e2bqh,upandalive,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:26:30 2015 UTC,"It can't hurt to ask but in my experience my pain doctors only handle my pain, rheumatologist has their orders and meds.

I wake up in pain, I go to bed dreading waking up again.   I can't work..I may never be able to work, it drives me insane...we just want to be able to work and lead our own lives  I want my own house or my own apartment, I want to be able to have my own dog, I want to be able to work every day and have friends  FUCK. it's really fucking miserable and fucking unfair, that sounds so childish to say but it is...so many people are blessed with baseline health and they don't even really comprehend how lucky they are  I'm so so sorry.

I truly believe things can be okay, and you can focus on fulfilling things that you're capable of doing - focus on the things you can control, not the things out of your control (I know there are..far too many things...it can be maddening to obsess over them) - at least that's what I'm trying to do..

I feel so alone right now, mostly because I am always alone, but even more so now that I have no idea what to do.  I first applied for disability back in Dec. 2010 and since then, went through my entire savings, lost my apartment, my car, everything I own and had to pack up what remained and move in with my mother, who is not a supportive person on her best days, which are far and few between.  I had been in a perfect place in my life, having moved to a different state to continue working on my degree while dealing with the pain I was having until it became too much for me to even get out of bed in the mornings.  I had no insurance so no real way to get the treatment I needed to keep the pain and degeneration in my spine at bay and now I am paying the price.  I have lost almost all my friends over time and feel like a burden to anyone else, so I try to keep my true thoughts to myself, which makes things even worse.  I was going to therapy for a while last year until things became difficult between my mother and myself and I could hardly ever borrow her car and I had to stop going to my weekly therapy appointments.  Now I just sit alone every day in my room, keeping myself occupied with the internet or gaming, but that gets very boring after years of the same old thing every day.  I feel like I am lost in a foreign world with nobody even noticing I am even alive unless I stand in front of them screaming my head off, and even then I feel like I'm just pushed aside as someone brushing off an annoying fly or mosquito.    As you said, you are going through similar things but it still feels like I'm all alone in this fight for survival and someone just took my last scrap of clothing from me, leaving me naked and cold and scared in a corner, afraid to even speak.  I used to have dreams, I used to have goals, I used to have fun even on my own, but now I dread the future and my biggest fear of all is coming true...  I will probably die alone, yet another penniless vagrant that will get tossed aside and regarded as a loser in life as the winners forget about me a second later.  I have lost all strength to fight for what I want or even what I need and I have no clue how to get that back."

The judge actually told my lawyer that he felt it was his job to save the government money. Not like, ya know, help determine who has a legitimate disability... but to save the fucking government money. The expert even said there were no jobs available for someone with my limitations. Judge was just like nahhhhh. I'm still pretty bitter about it. I got the same judge twice. That shouldn't be a thing. My state can be a total cesspit sometimes... The governor is an asshole and it just goes down from there, apparently. I had a good lawyer and everything. But the judge just dripped with disinterest and disbelief. He went so far as to call my testimony ""not credible"" which I think just means he thinks I'm a liar. I at least have a husband who supports me, money is tight as fuck but we get by most of the time. I am so sorry about your situation. It sounds a lot less tenable than mine. But please don't give up, there has got to be a way to get by. Do you have places local to you like food banks or other types of charitable assistance? I'm currently going to a low cost clinic in my area and the copay is only $5 per visit and $2 for each medication. Places like that can be really helpful if you're not already on that. And sometimes they can point you toward other types of assistance that's available in your area, especially for people like us who tend to slip through the cracks. My lawyer advised me to get more evidence and go back to try again later. Maybe with this clinic helping me out I will be able to obtain enough evidence of being permanently screwed to convince them that, yes, I really am fucking disabled. Friend, please don't lose hope entirely. Things may be really hard right now but there is always the chance that they will get better. You just have to give it time and keep looking. There have been so many points where I was convinced nothing was ever going to change, but then it did. Life is change, and it's not always for the worse.

ChronicPain,3e0uu7,AmantisAsoko,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:01:10 2015 UTC,"I have spent the past 5 years dealing with this since I first applied for disability, but I've been dealing with the pain for well over 20 years.  It was an annoyance at first but when I was in my late 20s I had a back injury that aggravated things which is why I tried to return to college.  After 2 years of community college I transferred to a university, moving across the country as well.  I had to take a year off from school to become a resident of the state so I didn't have to pay the out of state tuition, so I kept working, even though the pain was getting worse and worse every day.  I have done nothing except work as a chef since I was 19, so I had to continue working in a kitchen since I had no experience with anything else.  When I did finally become a resident of the state (one full year since moving) I started classes again and that is when things got really bad.  I had to withdraw from the semester, took the summer off and kept working, then decided that I couldn't work and go to school at the same time since it was too much for me to handle, so I left work in August of 2010 and focused on the fall semester.  By October I had to again withdraw from classes because I was barely able to make it to classes or even focus on my school work.  By then my pain was a daily 9/10.  After another year living in another state, having no income and then no savings left, I had to move back across the country to move in with my mother.    At that point I was able to get on Medicaid and get some kind of treatment for the pain, but ever since then I have been told many times that my pain is only in my head.  Even after all the exams and MRIs and xrays show degenerative disk disease, bulging disks and a region in my SI joint that was inflamed, I'm told my pain doesn't exist, and my doctors repeatedly have commented on that in my medical records.  Because of that, the judge determined my condition is only ""moderate"" not ""severe"" and that does not constitute full disability.    I have been through so much over the past 5 years, dealing with my living situation which is not healthy to begin with since my mother is an alcoholic and has told my entire family that I'm ""faking it"", I have given up hope.  If my own family doesn't believe me, yet I am in agony every single day, how am I supposed to go on with trying anymore?  I don't have a spouse, or significant other, to rely on or support me, so I live on food stamps and that is it.

Honestly I don't have any idea how you can fix that except maybe to keep getting new evidence. Your pain very obviously DOES exist. I guess I'm just annoyingly optimistic, but I really believe something will change for you. Maybe not what we all wish would change, the pain, but perhaps something in your support system/network. There are resources out there, sometimes hard to find but there has to be something that will help you. I know this really doesn't help much right now, though, and I'm sorry life has become so difficult for you. You deserve to be believed and you deserve the proper support. Pain is such a hard thing to deal with. No one should have to deal with it alone. Have you joined any support groups in your area or seen a therapist? Sometimes they can offer a fresh perspective and help you change your thinking. I know how defeated you are feeling, and it's totally understandable and valid to feel that way, but I don't want to see you eaten alive by it. We may be strangers but I really do care what happens to you."
ChronicPain,3e0uu7,potpastor,2,Tue Jul 21 14:42:19 2015 UTC,"First up, if you're hard up for cash and in any way related to veterans, check out the american legion, the eagles, etc. Also, I dont know if theyre the same, but try applying for SSI. You can also probably contact your local chamber of commerce to get the numbers of disability lawyers. I have one a town away, so you might have one too, and you might be able to get disability with their help. Talk to your doctor about what your condition is doing to your life and ask about disability options. If they aren't onboard, check around for a community counciling center. A lot of the time they have group therapy or private psychologist/psychiatrist services for cheap that you can utilise. They can sign off on disability if it's impacting your mental health. Most hospital systems also have some kind of ""option advisor"" that you can go to with your care issues and they'll advise your best route. I know of a couple people who've had them also offer advice and options for assisted living, so you might have one that advises on disability, too."

My doctor knows everything that is going on with my live including my difficulties with daily living and even still, after reading the judges decision and the records he based that on, my doctors all still have doubts that my pain is even real and it is a ""somatic response"", basically saying it's all in my head.  I have been to a therapist, and even she had told me, after 10 months of weekly appointments, that maybe therapy wasn't for me.

He unfortunately is no longer with us due to complications from MS 4 years ago, so I can't ask him about anything.  He never really liked to talk about his service for a couple of reasons, but he always said that he joined the Air Force to avoid the draft (his little joke I guess).  After doing some research after his passing, I found out a little about his service history and he was a Sergeant part of some kind of Voice Intercept Processing Specialist.  I now know that he spoke at least 4 languages, including Mandarin, Korean, and Russian.  This was all kind of a shock when I had found this out as part of my research into his service history."

ChronicPain,3e14sz,geckocurly,2,Tue Jul 21 03:49:47 2015 UTC,"Honestly most physical therapists have very little training and can cause you more pain however I would NOT recommend getting spine surgery. Surgeons make a lot of money off surgery so they won't tell you the truth that around 30% of back surgeries are failures (meaning the pain is the same or worse).  I did have a friend who was able to get rid of her sciatica via yoga and core strengthening exercises. Doing the right type of exercises can help in some cases. Did the doctor tell you what the ""grade"" of the spondylolisthesis was? If it's a low grade then you really should avoid surgery. Avoiding high impact activities like jogging or any heavy lifting is a must but you probably already know that. It is possible to avoid surgery if you are careful with your activities and keep your core strong.   I know I am biased since I did have two different surgeries for my spondylolisthesis and I am far worse off now due to permanent nerve damage. I also now have a type of spinal arthritis that is considered a ""normal"" result of having a spinal fusion."
ChronicPain,3e14sz,leilahazlett,2,Tue Jul 21 04:27:56 2015 UTC,"Exercise, pilates, eating very well, no alcohol, never doing heavy back work ever. I was a UK TV camera operater. I had to stop when at stage two. I retrained as a teacher and now train camera operators. I never lift heavy items any more, I try to keep healthy. I have chronic pain for a different reason now - not connected to this issue. Weight is a big factor here and if you're underweight try to put weight on. Your core muscle needs to be strong enough to handle daily tasks. Even when I was carrying all my TV gear around my core was not strong as I was underweight. Same can happen if your over-weight too. The core muscle must be strong. It took about two years from being not able to walk on my honeymoon to being in a life where I forget I had back pain. I was diagnosed 2005. Thought about surgery myself but knew deep down I was not healthy enough to justify saying I had tried everything. I'm glad I did not have it but I understand why people do. Some people heal fast and have no issues, I felt I was always unlucky so always thought try anything you can before going under the knife. I hope you find an answer. Good luck."
ChronicPain,3e14sz,PWaiters,2,Tue Jul 21 08:32:35 2015 UTC,I have lumbar spondylosis and I'm in constant pain so you have my sympathy.
ChronicPain,3e14sz,thefragile99,2,Tue Jul 21 12:52:47 2015 UTC,"With a grade II spondylolisthesis you're smart to avoid surgery.  Lumbar fusion should only be considered in the presence of gross spinal instability.  Gross spinal instability is most often times present after an accident.  A grade II spondylolisthesis does not result in gross instability.  A lumbar fusion should not be considered to reduce pain, often times following fusion pain is the same or worse.  A fusion should only be considered to stabilize a spine that is so unstable the spinal cord or nerve roots are being compromised or may be compromised.    With a spondylolisthesis you need to work the anterior trunk musculature and the gluteal musculature.  Lumbar extension increases the stress and strain on the pars interarticularis (site of fracture with spondylolisthesis) and increases anterior shear forces.  Strength, endurance, and neuromuscular control of the anterior trunk musculature and gluteal musculature controls excessive lumbar extension and thus anterior shear forces.   Specific exercises, sets, reps, etc. are dependent on your current trunk and gluteal strength, endurance, and neuromuscular control levels.  This would need to be assessed by a professional, in person.  Improving the ability of these specific muscle groups to control anterior shear, lumbar extension, and basically stabilize your spine more efficiently will reduce pain and disability.

This, as far as I know, is supposed to be a support group. I'm new to this sub and can't offer much advice on anything; I can't tell you that it will get better, I don't think anyone can. I can tell you time usually helps dull the pain of losing someone, even if it doesn't go away completely.   I know having unexpected complications are a huge bummer. All you can do here is roll with the punches and explore all your treatment options. Try not to get bogged down on all the things that could/have gone wrong and maintain optimism for future treatments and the things that have gone right so far. Some of which are that you have a diagnosis, something that several people here do not have. You also had 30 years of pain free regular-people living, which in itself is a blessing. Although that can make the loss feel more significant, it is definitely a blessing that you had that time. But then again, I'm definitely a little biased on that topic.  I developed a ton of back problems when I was 19 with no discernible cause and it forced me out of my very promising career track as a critical care nurse. I've given up hope that I will live without pain, that just doesn't seem feasible. But I have not given up hope that I will accomplish different goals and still live a very fulfilling life.   Your life has changed and it's totally not fair. Don't let the shitty changes bring you down. Everything is an opportunity. I know that sounds like a terrible cliche, but it's true.

But no one talks about the fact that pain perception is a very real factor, which is that the same pain stimulus can be felt either stronger or weaker depending on your mental state.

ChronicPain,3dwb9l,bugmom,6,Mon Jul 20 03:52:12 2015 UTC,"Sorry - my reaction is not so positive.  The problem I have is that there are many of us with chronic conditions that cannot be cured and that leave us in constant pain but we frequently get lumped under the term ""chronic pain""  Chronic pain is often defined as ""any pain lasting more than 12 weeks. Whereas acute pain is a normal sensation that alerts us to possible injury, chronic pain is very different. Chronic pain persistsâ€”often for months or even longer.""  However, in a disease like Rheumatoid arthritis, my pain really is acute pain - the finger joints that are screaming in pain as I type this ARE being damaged, right now, this very moment.  They are swollen, red, inflamed, and let me repeat, being damaged.  I know this and my doctor knows this from the MRI's we use to follow their ongoing deterioration.  However, because it is a lifelong condition, it gets thrown in under the term ""chronic pain.""  A great attitude, exercising more, eating the right berries will not stop the ongoing damage or the constant acute pain associated with it.  And there are many other conditions that fall into this category.  The condition is chronic but the pain is acute but since it goes on for years they call it chronic.  Articles like the one you wrote do a disservice to people like us because they cause others to think our pain isn't real or it could simply be ""cured"" if we just worked harder at it.  I work very hard at living the best life I can, every day.  I also work very hard just to walk across the room.  Hell, some days I work very hard just to be able to shower.  And my two knee replacements have me pretty convinced that the pain I had before them, bone on bone pain due to horrible deterioration, well that pain was not in my head."

However, I disagree that a good attitude is not important even if pain is the result from a damaging condition.   I recognize that there is no finish line when it comes to this stuff. But a negative mindset will do a person more harm over the course of ones life than a positive one.   I'll have the go over my wording again because the last thing I want to do is give an impression that the pain is not real. All I'm trying to draw attention to is that some people add to their real pain with unnecessary psychological pain. I know my pain was real, but I also know that some of my behavior was self sabotaging. I'm not talking about being cured, or that pain is illusory. Just that pain wrecks havoc on the mind, and then it interferes with our ability to help ourselves achieve a better quality of life, whatever that means for each person.

And we are surrounded by people (including many in the medical field who are supposed to be helping us) who cannot fathom what our lives are like, who think because they cannot see our conditions (funny, you don't look sick,) or they believe we are drug seeking, or just lazy slackers, and those people jump at the ""you can make yourself feel better"" aspect as proof of those beliefs.  I realize it's not what you set out to do but I long for a way for those people to understand the hell in which we exist -- not because I'm loving my pain but because we long for a little empathy.

He actually worked with me, had a plan of other pain medication management if the current medicine I was taking wasn't working.  He was not afraid to prescribe the dose that I need which is quite high. He also gave me a few refill which nobody has ever done. Gave me hope and relief I hadn't had in a year or with any other pain doctor."
ChronicPain,3dwwnz,VidenTheColdOne,5,Mon Jul 20 05:19:56 2015 UTC,I have had the same experience in my foot and I am also on gabapentin. In my situation when I try to sleep my foot feels like an oven and little gnomes are stabbing it with the swords you get in a drink. I have found lidocaine gel pretty helpful at calming it down to the point I can at least sleep. It may not be affective if you need it for your whole lower body though :/
ChronicPain,3dwwnz,unclepierre,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:31:56 2015 UTC,"Afaik with gabapenton the doses have to be huge beige you see any real effect. My mom took doses of like 2600/3200 or so before seeing an effect.   Also, cortisone shots? I get them in my spine to help the horrific nerve pain I get down my buttock ad leg. Works for about 8-12 months at a time if done correctly."

The cold numbed the burning/stabbing sensation so I could at least get a few hrs of sleep.   I tried all sorts of supplements like b12, co enzyme Q10, alpha lipoid acid, etc. but none of those made any difference for me."
ChronicPain,3dx0n9,just_me_29,3,Mon Jul 20 06:07:43 2015 UTC,"The exchange varies by state, as do the plans. You HAVE to read the literature on the plans to see what is covered and know what you will be expected to pay. If you need help, you can call and they can assist you - some states even have exchange sites where you can go in.  Here's an example of my current plan sheet: http://docdro.id/hmiZlIv  They'll all look similar to that - they're standardized for a reason. HMOs are cheaper than PPOs in general, however they usually have a more limited network of doctors and often require you to select a PCP. The HMO will then only cover specialist visits if you have a referral from your PCP.  For example, re bloodwork with my plan - it says once my deductible is met, I'm only responsible for 10% of the bill. Up until my $1500 deductible though, I'll pay the prorated UHC rate for them. I just switched from a PPO to an HMO because I've been out of work for a year and need to save money.   You just really need to research your plan before you commit to it. You can call them directly to ask as well. Also, ask your doctors which insurances they accept (and let them know you'll be getting an ACA plan - my doctor took Aetna for example, so I made sure that's what I got, and when I tried to go in - NOPE, just kidding!! Not ACA Aetna! :|)"
ChronicPain,3dx0n9,lbsmith5,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:47:49 2015 UTC,"As long as I can physically afford it, I plan on using a PPO. I have heard a lot of bad stories about the hurdles of HMO's. I read almost the entire benefit booklets for the 2 I was looking at, and called the company to verify providers that were covered. I am doing a cost analysis if it can save me money, because I do not make much per year anyway. Healthcare is expensive.  I called BCBS, w/ my current plan info. They explained what their network system is, and what it would be if I bought the plan. They then looked up the providers for me. I am pretty sure it is what I need. It is only for a few months until open enrollment though.  What I have to make sure: PT and Lab tests are covered. The lab bill to insurance on Average for a comprehensive gc/ms UDS from PM doctor is $4000.  I can't afford a HDHP, I would go broke."
ChronicPain,3dx0n9,lbsmith5,2,Mon Jul 20 23:00:41 2015 UTC,"Definitely get a PPO. My best experiences have been with PPOs. I was on HDHPs for many years through work before ACA, and it was a horrible experience. I only recently switched to a HMO because I'm having some money issues right now (getting divorced, out of work). I have a bunch of interviews lined up and made sure they all had great benefits, haha. Healthcare is SO expensive - my PPO was almost $400 a month, my HMO is just over $300. But I knew what I needed to be covered."

ChronicPain,3dx0n9,Halt_I_Am_Ragnar,3,Tue Jul 21 04:41:45 2015 UTC,"The trap I fell in is that there is a difference between the ACA and non-ACA version of an insurance. For example, it's not just BlueShield -- it's ACA BlueShield.   If you want to make absolutely sure the new insurance is accepted, call and ask specifically if the Healthcare Exchange version is covered.   I was fucked over royally with this. Spent $550/mo on a plan that no one could accept because no one had any contracts with that version yet. I had to pay all my doctor visits and proceedures out of pocket."

I think I'm three years on without an explanation for the various types of pain that have cropped up. The rheumatologist said I definitely have arthritis, but it's idiopathic and there was nothing he could do for me. I've seen so many other specialists, to no avail, and I know I still should get checked out by a neurologist for the nerve pain, and someone for the muscle pain. So many tests, so many disappointments.  I hope you find an answer that comes with a reasonable solution. I'm grateful that I'd been forced to go into business for myself after I was laid off in 2009 because I can work from my bed using my laptop. (That's what I'm doing right now.) I have other complicating factors like CFS that are more debilitating than the pain, though. I'm actually kind of lucky that the pain isn't the worst of my troubles, after reading how many people in this sub live each day.   I'd like to thank you for being a nurse, because nurses are so often overworked and underappreciated, and we were blessed with a wonderful nursing team when my dad finally succumbed to cancer last year.

Other times I'll get grumpy over people complaining about minor everyday stuff. In my head, not out loud.   Occasionally people are tactless like my colleague who was told she couldn't dance for 8 weeks following her sprained ankle. At this point I hadn't been able to dance in 4 or 5 years & unlikely to be able to ever again. I was very sympathetic but I definitely wasn't feeling the empathy that day.   You know those people who have nothing else to do except complain about nothing? I don't have much energy for those people anymore.   But for people who are genuinely having a hard time, I still have all the empathy in the world."
ChronicPain,3dsn6h,printerclips,4,Sun Jul 19 08:59:12 2015 UTC,"I think (some) people want to feel empathy. I don't think they are capable of understanding something on this level the same way I'm not capable of understanding what a rape victim feels or what it's like to grow up in a war zone. You can attempt empathy, but sometimes it's not possible.  Then there are people who don't even try. Those are the people that make life more complicated."
ChronicPain,3dsn6h,Pharmapill,3,Sun Jul 19 03:46:41 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's impossible. There are many writers out there who have written very convincingly about things they themselves have never experienced. Most people simply don't want to feel the ""bad feelings"", in fact, a lot of people have grown up in families where ""if you don't have anything good to say, don't say anything at all"" wasn't just a colloquialism, it was more or less a rule. It's not hard for that to evolve into ""if you can't think about anything good, then don't think about it.""  I've watched enough war movies to consider myself a pacifist. Do I know exactly what it's like to get shot at, to watch everyone around you die randomly, to wonder when it might be you? No, of course I don't. They're movies. I just imagine that as bad as the movie looks, the real thing is immeasurably worse, and no one should ever have to be in that situation."

They certainly don't need you to make more for them. :) I think empathy is always going be an imperfect thing by definition -- there's no way to physically be in someone's head -- so when someone doesn't quite understand what it's like to have a physical or mental illness, or what it's like to be abused, or to be a minority, or to be poor, etc., that's okay. But when they don't want to or are unable to even accept it, that's something else. It means they're scared of the thought that horrible things can happen to anyone, regardless of who they are or what they do, and yes, in my experience, they often blame the person who ""forced"" them to think about it. It's like runners in a race being told ""Okay, here's the rules: Run as fast as you can to the finish line. Every so often during the race, we're going to randomly shoot at you, no matter how close you are to the finish line, or even if you've already crossed it. Good luck!"""

I still have empathy for anyone experiencing pain, even if it's a seemingly small, short lasting one. Because:  A.) Pain is entirely subjective, and what might be a 3 for me could be an 8 for them. Meaning, they could actually be feeling more pain than I am. I run into this with doctors all the time. They treat me based on how much pain they think I'm in, not on how much pain I'm telling them I'm in. If I say it's a 9, it's a f*#king 9, dammit! I don't care what you think it is.  B.) Let's say someone is happy about buying a new car, but I just bought a new house. I wouldn't be disdainful of that person's happiness because I think I'm happier than they are. I would be thrilled for them. So, why wouldn't I empathize with a person's pain even if I feel I'm suffering more than they are."

Meaning, they could actually be feeling more pain than I am.   I think this is extremely important to remember. Everyone deals with things differently, whether it's physical pain, emotional pain, social rejection, etc. It may seem ridiculous to hear a teenager crying her eyes out because she got dumped, or ranting in his blog about some girl whom he's crushed on forever, whatever. It seems laughable when you've gone through a lot of ""stuff"" in life. But their pain is still real, and it's still something you can empathize with.  I try my best to practice what I preach, but I totally get what /u/deletetables is saying. Empathy is like a muscle -- it gets stronger the more you exercise it, but it also can get tired if it's been overworked (in the case of dealing with your own pain, which requires its own brand of empathy to prevent you from being too hard on yourself)."

Meanwhile I suffer invisibly every day, have for years, and might suffer until the day I die.

There's no way for them to know that I have constant, chronic daily headaches, but inside I'm all ""GGGGGGGGGGGAAAAAAAAAAAHHHH"". Although sometimes it's someone who does know about my condition and complains anyway, which sometimes makes me feel that all relationships are false. But that's a separate issue... kind of...  And I think you've made an important point about having more empathy because you ""know what it's like"". That's what got me thinking about whether empathy is possible without actually having the same experience as someone else. I think my sense of compassion for anyone living with chronic pain is so much higher than it ever could possibly have been had I not experienced it myself. So what I'm really wondering is, can you ever really ""understand"" and ""share"" (which are strong words if you think about it) the experience of someone else if you haven't experienced it yourself?"
ChronicPain,3dsn6h,netbich,2,Sun Jul 19 03:41:58 2015 UTC,"I would say, yes. I've had severe pain for over a decade, and on strong drugs for it for about 8 years (like Fentanyl and morphine) now. To me, the worse it hurts, the more empathetic I feel. I absolutely hate seeing anyone in pain, and truly wish that they would be free of it- just like I wish that mine would stop.   I suppose I don't understand exactly what another person goes through (everyone's pain is unique to themselves), but I still feel like I understand what they go through as a result of it.  Oh, but I guess I do agree a bit with /u/deletetables, in that, if it's something like a temporary problem like a sprained ankle or something similar, I feel like I'd rather have those problems instead. And it does bug me when people complain about how ""extremely difficult"" and ""how unbelievably painful"" (physically and mentally) having a sprain that prevents you from running for a few weeks is. It's temporary- be grateful.  Overall, though... I'd also agree that I have more empathy. Especially as the pain gradually gets worse."

At my first visit, the pain specialist showed me a chart of 10 or so different 'levels' of dealing with back pain, from chiropractors and physical therapy, up to injections, drugs, etc. There's a lot of different things a pain specialist can do that a PCP won't necessarily have the expertise to try.

I just read the NY Times article warning against taking any of those very much--take sparingly and only occasionally.  I don't know how to create a link but the article is titled Experts Urge Sparing Use of Nonaspirin Painkillers and was published on July 13.

Here's a quote for those that don't have the time to read the full article:  ""Looking at people treated for Oxycontin addiction alone, a study in the American Journal of Psychiatry found that the vast majorityâ€”78 percentâ€”never had a legitimate prescription and a similar number reported cocaine use and previous treatment for substance abuse.  Unless you're ready to believe that doctors can turn pain patients into coke fiends, the simpler explanation is that painkiller addiction hits people who are already abusing other drugs. These people know where to buy stuff like coke and heroin, unlike pain patientsâ€”a.k.a. your parents and grandparentsâ€”who tend to be unfamiliar with how street drug markets operate.  Data on people who start pain treatment yields the same conclusion: The vast majority don't misuse their drugs."""

Sorry for the rant. I am so sick of hearing the newest efforts to crack down and fight the new problem of Rx and now heroin addiction (in which the newscaster says, ""was caused by pain medications being prescribed"" and nods her head). It is just fine to ignore the problem that they are creating which is restricting access to effective and humane treatment of pain, whether acute or chronic. It feels like what they are doing is restricting access to a problem that they themselves contributed to in the first place.   I am sick of going to work fighting every day to come home and have to sit down for an hour to get myself and head together after fighting another day in pain, and I need/have to keep the job to pay the bills and the insurance.

Level 5 headache is intolerable but can often be helped with acetaminophen and/or ibuprofen, and level 6 is the tipping point at which a heating pad or OTC drug isn't going to cut it.)  I hate taking opiates. I hate the way they make me feel - other than the pain relief part, of course. Friends want me to try MJ, but I'm going to wait until it's legally available. Secondhand pot smoke at rock concerts makes me terribly ill, and I'm not convinced that illegally obtained edible MJ won't do the same. They've technically voted to legalize MMJ in my state, but patients won't have access to it until at least next year.

ChronicPain,3djhbc,xsunxspotsx,3,Tue Jul 21 15:23:57 2015 UTC,"Opiates, well, they help my pain, some of it, but they don't really improve my quality of life. If my pain is too great to where I need opiates it's already too great for me to do anything that causes me pain and thus kind of pointless. Marijuana on the other hand I find actually makes my pain worse, I think only mentally, I focus on it more, well, mostly mentally, it does cause mild muscle soreness which I already have a problem with so that's no good. It does however amplify the pain killing effects of opiates, but then we're in the same problem back with opiates.   I'm not everyone of course, but my point is it's not for everyone either. However I do feel, from general opinions I've heard over the years, that it probably could be used in conjunction with opiates to decrease the amount needed. It also helps some of the side effects of opiates, particularly the nausea and decreased appetite."

ChronicPain,3djhbc,kryptobs2000,2,Fri Jul 17 02:19:32 2015 UTC,"With my questions, I wanted to eliminate our social bias against either of these plants -- the hemp plant, and the opium poppy. Consider a world where we don't regulate what can and cannot enter our bodies.  Opium has been used since prehistoric times. Evidence exists for its use as a pain reliever and ""heart warmer"" in the Mediterranean civilizations c. 1100 BCE. The Greeks used a mixture of hemlock and opium to put people to death.  Laudanum, a tincture of opium and alcohol was used to treat pain and a number of other conditions in Europe as early as the middle ages.  Morphine was isolated from opium in 1804 and has been since then, the drug of choice for moderate to severe pain.  Cannabis has been used for an equally long time for relaxation, sleep, and spiritual purposes. Yet, some people do achieve some amount of analgesia from smoking reefer. We get a similar result with some of the minor tranquilizers -- people experience pain relief from their sedating properties.  Modern research shows that certain cannabinoids are opioid sparing, and there may be other medical uses of grass. These two plants can be used together in the treatment of pain in a way that is safer than the use of opioids with benzodiazepenes.   Those frightening, addictive, society threatening opioids have always been and are still the best medication for analgesia, especially for the relief of moderate to severe pain.  Both of these plants are gifts from God.  Our nervous system is activated by both marijuana and opium. The human body contains both  neuroreceptors for the medicinal use of compounds derived from both plants, and itself manufactures endogenous compounds that mimic the effect of these substances.   Only in the late 19th century did these substances become regulated and outlawed. The English, looking for a source of cheap labor, outlawed the use of opium in China. In the US, legislation against psychoactive substances began in the first decade of the 20th century, when American industry needed a cheap source of labor.   Who knew that Coca Cola contained cocaine until 1906. Many health tonics available in the 19th century contained a mixture of opium and cocaine.  All the fuss about addiction and abuse are symptoms of modern society. Most of the harm that is derived from either pot or opioids comes from the legal consequences of breaking the law. Would opioid addiction be a problem if there were no laws preventing its open purchase?  Would people die from heroin overdose if pure heroin (diacetylmorphine) could be purchased from your local 7-11? It is only our drug laws that create artificial heroin like China White that contains fentanyl, a synthetic that is 200 times as powerful as morphine.  Now, look at what's happened in Colorado since Mary Jane became legal in 2014. Crime is down and many of the alarmist warnings about the decay of society have been proven false.   Have I've turned this post into a call for the legalization of medicinal substances?  You bet your sweet ass I have."

I have herniated discs in my cervical spine but when I was in physical therapy they always told me my exercises shouldn't hurt while I'm doing them. They told me specifically to tell them if something hurts so we could try something else. Is it while you are doing the rowing and stuff that it hurts or is it just after you're done?
ChronicPain,3dkgwi,Sarahtaha,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:44:56 2015 UTC,"It hurts during and it lingers a bit (pain to a much lesser degree) when Im done. Honestly the pain during the exercises is very minimal. Im more concerned on the days after I do the therapy. Right now, it seems like my symptoms are getting worse on my off-days but Ive only been doing this PT for a week. Shes saying that most likely the muscles and ligaments will adapt and the pain will subside soon.  By the way, can I ask how you are doing now and how long it took you to get there?"
ChronicPain,3dkgwi,Sarahtaha,1 point,Fri Jul 17 04:08:15 2015 UTC,"Hmm maybe your body needs to adjust to the amount of activity you're doing then. It's been awhile since I've been in PT and my struggle with my herniated discs is on going, but I don't remember feeling like my pain was getting worse from PT even at the beginning. I only was in physical therapy a couple of months and had to discontinue because of work/insurance stuff. It seemed to help decrease my pain for a little bit but my pain came back. I remember liking the traction machine a lot. I think if I stayed in physical therapy longer it would have benefitted me more and maybe had more permanent results.  I started on Cymbalta not long after that and it was helping control my nerve pain really well for awhile. I've been using Tramadol for breakthrough pain. My pain has been increasingly coming back though in the last couple weeks, so I may look into getting back into physical therapy because it's been over a year since I went."
ChronicPain,3dkgwi,shootingforthesudan,2,Fri Jul 17 05:45:59 2015 UTC,"Generally speaking if you're in pain, and PT makes the pain worse, its not very good PT.

Using muscles again is great, but if you havent been using them for a long time it doesnt take much to stimulate them, and shouldn't be painful.  IMO"
ChronicPain,3dkgwi,LethargicSuccubus,2,Fri Jul 17 03:28:00 2015 UTC,"One of the biggest things she was telling me was that out discs arent as flimsy as many people make them out to be.

She says the increase in symptoms is just inflammation and my body adapting. Shes also telling me that she can get me pretty much better in the next 6 weeks or so too, so im not sure if this type of therapy is just really aggressive, and thus resulting in more initial discomfort than some other types of therapy.

If you have a 5mm herniation there is no such thing as ""just inflammation.""  5mm is not huge, but still could be impinging on a nerve or you could cause spondylolisthesis (when the vertebra's slip).    I did 5 years of PT on and off before finally having surgery.  Never had anyone tell me pain of any kind in my back or legs could be a good sign. Just keep it simple - pain (not soreness) is bad.

The fact that you dismissed the facts that the physio provided (which are accurate in regards to the discs), just because they're not a neurosurgeon is ridiculous.  Disc bulges and osteoarthritis are common occurrences in people with NO low back pain. They're a general sign of aging - much the same as wrinkles.

My point is very simple - increased SORENESS, Muscle Pain, etc etc can all be expected from PT.  Dismissing increased NERVE pain as 'normal' concerns me.

I suffer spasticity in general, but by far the worst is my upper-back and neck. I had Botox shots a few days ago, there's no noticeable improvements yet. They've got me fairly medicated though. I don't have some of the nerve pain component that you describe, but there is some to a certain extent.  By far the worst pain of my condition because it's always a constant. I'm sorry that you're having such a tough time. I'd really speak to your neurologist about an anti-convulsant and perhaps Cymbalta or Gabapentin (or both) to control pain levels. I'll be honest though, I've not found anything to fully combat it yet, Botox is my last hope.  The facial pain can possibly be early signs of Trigeminal Neuralgia, folks with MS often have it. You'll definitely want to speak to a neuro regarding this. I'm not sure if any of this helps, but as a fellow neuro patient, I really hope you find something to deal with this painful issue."

If you can get the nerve pain issue worked out, and there are many medications for it, you might have the Botox option too. It's a fairly expensive option but I have a medical retirement from DoD, so my insurance is tip-top and my copay was luckily only $15 - it still took some convincing and considerable efforts for prior authorization by my doctors in lobbying the insurance company.  I have been titrating off Gabapentin because it has some unfortunate side effects at the dose I was taking it - the daily max at 2700mg per 24 hours. It's caused significant edema, which if you're trying to live a life of normalcy, is pretty frustrating. I'd suggest avoiding this drug if you can when speaking to your doctor about neuropathic pain. I doubt you'll be on MAO inhibitors with a confirmed neurological diagnosis, but I'd suggest seeking out Cymbalta if you can. However, be forewarned, Cymbalta has a pretty short half-life and it's very difficult to come off of it once you're on; the withdrawal effects are excruciating. It has a positive side effect of raising your mood, at least it has for me, but my particular disorder hallmarks depression so that may not be the case for you.  Anyways, just a bit more info here.

I know what you mean about lobbying the insurance company, because the doctor I was seeing at the time said that my insurance required me to try three different drugs first (for Chronic Migraine) and to have them all fail to work before they would consider paying for Botox. I tried the three drugs, and we were just about to apply for coverage on the Botox when I got pregnant. When I was pregnant, I didn't have many symptoms and couldn't do Botox anyway.   Right now I'm breastfeeding, and I'm trying to wean my son so that I can at least go back on medications and also try the Botox. My symptoms hit me like a ton of bricks a couple months after my son was born. I was on Nortriptyline before I was pregnant and saw a small improvement, but I haven't tried Cymbalta.   I'm fortunate I'm not dealing with the depression issue at this time, just some anxiety because I'm always afraid of the next big pain attack and the days and nights are so unpredictable.   Thanks again for your reply and I hope the Botox really starts to make a strong difference for you soon. I'll definitely keep everyone updated and hope you'll do the same."

I have spasticity, as well as herniated disks and other spinal cord diseases. Most of my pain that is similar to what you are describing comes from my herniated and bulging discs. That is typically what the docs look for when pain ""shoots down"" the arm or leg. It is also very different from fibromyalgia pain, which is very similar to myelitis to the point where they missed my fibro Dx for years because they blamed the myelitis. Of course that is all just my experience. Myelitis is in the same family of diseases as MS and I had all the work up for that as well.

Amitriptyline dosage for depression is 75mg-150mg. So, dont worry too much about it.  All drugs will have side effects and the manufacturer has to put everything down. Being on 10mg I highly doubt you will get any. From my own experience I never ever had anyone that had trouble with amitryptyline except maybe drowsiness at the start.  A side note, you will grow tolerance to the drowsy effect after a week and after with that same dosage it shouldnt make you drowsy anymore. We recommend you to take it before bed because we dont want you to hurt yourself at work or driving.  Give it a go and you might need to increase its dosage. There are other drugs that reduce over-reactive nerves to try. Hope you eventually find something that works for you.   All your concerns should be able to be answered by your local pharmacist."

Its the  trying that can be hard. Good luck!"
ChronicPain,3djy4k,indigoherring,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:52:00 2015 UTC,"I have some pudendal nerve damage, and one of my docs put me on amitrypyaline. It is an SSRI but your nerves act in a system which relys on dopamine and serotonin triggers to work, and this works to re-adjust the overall sensitivity of your body's physiological reaction and ""tune down"" the nerve spikes. I assume they were prescribed at a low dose, at which they aren't really treating depression unless it is something you already have (which, with chronic pain quite honestly is always a factor, and sadness makes the body feel pain more intensely). It has turned down my nerve pains maybe 10%, and helped me sleep deeper which allows the body's literal time to heal. Warning I was tired the first few weeks, but now after a few months I can get by with some coffee and really enjoy that I have a pill which can help me get some better quality sleep. On a side note, it also works to relax the bladder wall, which for pelvic pains seems to mean this drug is specially indicated for that area to relax and rejuvenate. No side effects other than extra fatigue while adjusting I found."

Its just worst case."
ChronicPain,3didw8,dorkacon69,2,Thu Jul 16 14:53:42 2015 UTC,"That sounds horrible and I hope it goes away soon.  I don't know what an NCT is but I hope it shows the cause; also I hope you see your neurologist very soon.  I have pain from trigeminal neuralgia and it often feels like a very bad toothache, or two, sometimes both upper and lower, and it does radiate across the face.  I hope you don't have that!  It is apparently not diagnosed from any test, but just from the person's description of the pain, and the lack of anything else on an MRI.  I also hope your husband understands and doesn't call you a hypochondriac.  Sounds like you need to be worried about your health and pain."
ChronicPain,3didw8,manaolana,2,Thu Jul 16 15:28:17 2015 UTC,"I looked TN up last night. I read what can cause it, I think that's why the nerve pain thing clicked. I just got off the phone with my grandmother, she said she got it a lot with tooth aches. I have never had this pain before in my life. I have bad teeth, this isn't my first abceess. This sucks.   A NCT is a nerve conduction test. They're going to stick needles all in me and sock my nerves and see how they respond to things. Yay, not. Depending on what that shows, it will tell why I'm having this pain. If my nerves are messed up or if it's my tooth causing it. I'm in hell. Why can't this just be numbness or tingling like the rest. I can't feel from the waist down. It's wonderful because I don't feel the sciatica anymore unless it's really really bad.   As for my husband, he's an ass. All men are (usually in their own way). He has no idea about pain. He has chronic kidney stones, you would think he'd understand, he doesn't. He treats me differently now because of my pain. He thinks he'll hurt me. :/"
ChronicPain,3didw8,manaolana,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:13:18 2015 UTC,I am so sorry.  It sounds like my TN is not even as bad as what you have. It is too bad about your husband. I wish he understood he is hurting you by not being sympathetic and supportive.  I hope against hope it gets better for you.

ChronicPain,3dk7nm,IntoxicatedFury,6,Thu Jul 16 22:57:57 2015 UTC,"I'm not a good example of this. My pain/injury caused me to have to retire (at age 28) from my career, since I wasn't physically capable of doing it any more.  After that, all I could get were crappy minimum wage jobs. I had no office skills or similar.   Because retail jobs need you to be on your feet and often working long hours, my body would totally revolt sometimes. I tried to keep the calling in sick to a minimum - once every other week or less - but it didn't matter. I got fired from 3 different jobs and one just stopped booking me for shifts unless I complained, then I would get a few short or otherwise undesirable shifts, then the cycle would repeat.  Many people don't understand, because these diseases are invisible. You look just like anyone else, they don't know what's happening inside your body.  I would often get flack, people thought I partied too hard the night before, that sort of thing. They didn't understand how a relatively young person could be in the pain I am in. When all this was going down I didn't have proper treatment for my pain, so I was eating over the counter pain meds like candy just to get through the day. I'm sure my co-workers thought I was an addict.  My best advice is to find out what the labour laws are in your area - knowing your rights is always a good thing. It may also help you in getting accommodations, if you need them, to make working easier for you.   You may also want to consider training for less physically intensive work. It's better to prepare now, so that you don't find yourself between a rock and a hard place.   It's taken me a long time to put everything together, but I've been self employed for a few years now. I can work at my own pace, work when my body allows and take as many breaks as I need (within reason, of course). For me, it's been a good solution.   I hope things get better for you, it really sucks to be so young and have these issues."

Glad to hear you found something that works for you, if you don't mind my asking what kind of business/work are you doing? I would love to do something similar but all that comes to mind would be doing odd jobs for people on kijiji or whatever. I'm kind of in a situation where everything I can see myself wanting to do, I probably couldn't, at least not reliably, and everything that seems like I could do, I have no interest in. I'm going to book an appointment with a career counselor in hopes that my dream job hasn't come to mind yet.   As far as feeling guilty about time off did you ever start feeling like 'fuck it, my health is more valuable than a job' because I'm trying to get that mentality but it goes against my work ethic big time, and I'm feeling like I'm losing an uphill battle with my mind and it's slowly bringing me down.    I'll definitely take your advice as far as training for something less physical before it's too late but with the recession is going to be tough I'd imagine, fingers are crossed though.

ChronicPain,3dk7nm,ninja_wifey,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:40:27 2015 UTC,I really struggled with the pain vs my work ethic too & it took a couple of health professionals telling me if I did not back off I had no chance of getting better for me to finally stop.  At this point I am 29 and have not worked for 2 years. I have recently been trying some very small & very light volunteer work but that has meant everything else has basically had to stop again. Something I learnt when I finally stopped is no one else actually values the amount of your life you give up to keep working & no one at work has to deal with the consequences. Also your workplace goes on without you.  It is hard but please know your value is not in the work you do & your body has to last you many more years. That said I still struggle with this daily & have to keep reminding myself.

ChronicPain,3dj5ol,DiabolicalDee,2,Thu Jul 16 18:17:20 2015 UTC,"I have no words of wisdom but want you to know you're not alone, you will get through this and this to shall pass. Cymbalta withdrawal is terrible. I'm an ""old lady"" (47) with EDS Hypermobility, moderate to severe osteoarthritis in my spine and hips, costochondritis and was diagnosed with fibro before my EDS diagnosis but I'm not sure if that's still considered accurate or not. I also broke a few vertebrae about 15 years ago. The arthritis and DDD were both originally diagnosed over 30 years ago now. Here's what works for me and helps me work full-time.   In no particular order: Yoga for strength done in front of a mirror to prevent overextension. Walking -- outside and on treadmill. Getting a job that allows me to change positions as needed. Meditation. Heat. (Love my heavy duty heating pad that is weighted.) Keeping a gratitude journal. Learning to consciously notice the good small things in a day (like a perfect cup of tea). Laughing as much as possible every day. Long-acting pain med taken at same two times each day with another for break-through pain. Resting when necessary. And most importantly, good sleep hygiene. I don't always sleep well, but I always do all in my power to ensure I've given it a good try. I have accepted the fact that I will always have pain and that there are things I can no longer do. And I'm at peace with it.   My Cymbalta withdrawal honestly lasted a few weeks. Same with Savella. Horrible. It does get better though. Hang in there!"

It would get so bad that I would have upwards of 20 zaps in a minute at its peak.  The only thing that made them stop was my pain doc putting me on Savella. It's not easy to get with insurance. Its an automatic denial + appeal process. I've read that it can also give you zaps so its kind of a ticking clock. Trying to stay hopeful that it won't happen but...yeah

Expect the doctors to shovel the responsibility of actually diagnosing and treating you back on to your regular doctor. Pros: You might get dilaudid.
ChronicPain,3dgrj1,rainbow_butterfly,2,Thu Jul 16 17:30:24 2015 UTC,I'd suggest going to the hospital if you're close to a 10 because that's pretty bad with no pain medications.

I understand that many doctors don't take poor people insurance, but maybe there is a clinic that has some good ones.  My brother is living on SSDI and has to be on the state's (Hawai'i) free insurance.  He found a clinic with really good doctors.

So what Im saying is that if you take care of yourself and look after it, the situation might not be so bad when it comes.  Regarding self blame,  I too went to the gym to try and stay strong to avoid other issues but fked up my hip flexor and have been suffering from pain for over 7 months. I too ask myself why Im so frigging stupid but as time passes anger is replaced by acceptance? I dont know how to solve that problem but I feel you...  It seems like at the moment there are a lot of things to think about, what happened to you in the past, what is happening now and what will happen in the future.

I've had Complex Regional Pain Syndrome in my right foot/leg for the past five years and I've tried so many ineffective treatments but Calmare has worked for me.   Last November I took part in a clinical study at Mayo where they hooked up six sets of electrodes and ran a current through my back and leg for about a half hour a day for two weeks. I went from on crutches and not being able to wear a shoe or sock to running and sitting in the hot tub.   It wore off after a threeish months so I went back for a booster treatment in April felt great again. I'm scheduling another booster for the near future because my pain has come back but so far this is the best treatment I've tried. Let me know if you have any other questions!

The perception of pain is cancelled when the no-pain message replaces that of pain, by using the same pathway through the surface electrodes in a non-invasive way. Regardless of pain intensity, a patient's pain can be completely removed for immediate relief.   Here's the study done in 2010 (pdf warning) with chemotherapy patients.   At the end of the study (Day 10), a 20% reduction in numeric pain scores was achieved in 15 of 16 patients. The pain score fell 59% from 5.81+/-1.11 before treatment to 2.38+/-1.82 at the end of 10 days (P < 0.0001 by paired t-test). A daily treatment benefit was seen with a strong statistically significant difference between the pre and post-daily pain scores (P < 0.001). Four patients had their CIPN reduced to zero."
ChronicPain,3dcp2b,ninja_wifey,2,Wed Jul 15 06:16:08 2015 UTC,"I have not heard about it before. I would take what that study says with a grain of salt as there are a few too many variables. The patients are not blinded (ie those being treated know they are being treated), there is no control and there are very few people involved. I realise it was only a pilot study but I feel like if there were big results still being noticed we would have heard more about it. That said, I'm curious professionally and personally about what is out the and am interested if you find any more studies of ppl who know more about it."
ChronicPain,3dcp2b,rainbow_butterfly,1 point,Wed Jul 15 12:07:47 2015 UTC,"Some more sause I found:  Apparently there are trials at Johns Hopkins, the Mayo Clinic, BYU, and other universities. On the Calmare site, if you go under Locations > U.S. Treatment Centers, most of the clinics have websites and accompanying testimonials.  The Johns Hopkins trial  The site says that they only sell the Calmare to allopathic (the opposite of homeopathic) physicians. The site also claims it has helped over 4,000 patients worldwide with no negative side effects."

I use my TENS machine on very bad nights and it really helps. If my skin would tolerate it, I'd use my TENS every night.   I actually sleep best after my 6am meds.

ChronicPain,3dcfj7,dyliecious,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:42:27 2015 UTC,"I'm prescribed Neurontin (gabapentin) for nerve pain and RLS.  I'm also on a decent sized (legal) cocktail of other opiates,  benzos,  amphetamines, etc but that's a whole other story lol. So anyway it turns out that I can't take the neurontin at all during waking hours because it throws me through a flipping loop even though I  have an extremely high opiate (I know they're not an opiate, I'm just using that for an example) tolerance.  Weird, right? Anyway, I take about 900 to 1200 mgs a night (depending on how my day went, my pain level,  anxiety level, my RLS severity,  how tired I am in general, etc) And it knocks me the the HECK out.  I get (mostly) good quality and a decent quantity of sleep with minimal nerve/RLS pain throughout the night.  My only advice is to go right to bed after taking the meds or you'll most likely feel very drunk and not in a good way,  also make sure you have enough time in the morning before you have to function in any adult or responsible-type capacity, because sometimes I'll still feel ""drunk"" for an hour or two after I wake up (dizziness,  double vision,  for example).  But all in all,  after countless OTC and prescription sleep  meds, antidepressants, herbal supplements and even some good smoke this seems to be the only thing that works for me at the moment. It's truly been a Godsend.  I hope I helped some,  and I hope you get relief soon.  There are very few things worse than insomnia and that's not even counting when the insomnia is caused/exacerbated by chronic pain/illness. Good luck!   Also, don't take neurontin or the generic, gabapentin, without talking to your PCP first.  It's essentially an epilepsy drug that's not to be messed with unless you're under your doctors care.    :)"
ChronicPain,3dcfj7,LittleKitchenWitch,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:50:22 2015 UTC,Thanks for your reply! I see a new doctor in a few weeks. I just moved so starting over. I think my rls is a huge contributor right now. Is that stress related in your experience? Definitely something I'm going to speak to the new doc about though

ChronicPain,3dbupi,shrimpsmalls,2,Wed Jul 15 02:00:16 2015 UTC,"It works but you gotta give it 10-14 days to set in. It does need to be repeated regularly. I had one spot stay relaxed for 11 months, but it's common for them to repeat it every 3 months."

Not a bad feeling, more of a neutral feeling (after the injections). I found that my facial muscles didn't move right after, but that's really what Botox does. You can try and move with all your might, and it'll feel like you're moving it but it only responds a fraction, kind of like if a limb falls asleep and doesn't move quit right.

I told him I was suicidal and he just wrote it on paper and did and said nothing else.   This is what I would consider unethical behavior worthy of a malpractice claim.  Edit; YOU have nothing to be embarrassed about. It's this quack who should be embarrassed.
ChronicPain,3d9194,netbich,2,Tue Jul 14 13:36:49 2015 UTC,I wouldn't even know how to go about it. I just feel so crappy.
ChronicPain,3d9194,sushisay,5,Wed Jul 15 06:45:40 2015 UTC,"I know it wasn't your intention, but your post brought me to tears.  I'm so sorry you're having it so rough.  I can relate, of course.  Your doctor is an ass, to say the least.  I'm sure if there was a way to switch, you would, right?  I would hate to give you any useless advice because I hate getting useless advice and people give it to me all the time.    What is an embarrassment is that we got this issue shoved down our throats:  chronic pain.  Not just pain, but the kind of pain that makes us question our will to stay here in this life.  When I reach that level of frustration, I just try to focus on the love I have for my family.  For me, the pain started later in life though (8 1/2 years now of chronic daily fucking migraines) so I do have kids and a husband, but with that comes a great deal of guilt...it's hard to take care of anyone and that, essentially is my role...I'm the caretaker and I definitely am embarrassed when there's no food the house and my husband has come home from an exhausting day of busting his ass at work and the kids are hungry but I just can't possibly do a thing about it.    So even though our situations differ, you can become a toddler any time in life.  ;)  But as I mentioned earlier, we are not the embarrassment...it's this fucking lot in life we were handed that is the shameful thing.  Nobody chooses this kind of life.    I really do hope you get the automatic car.  You know, things do change in life sometimes.  I'm not going to sit here and tell you that you'll get it one day, but it is a possibility.  If you do get a different car, then maybe you can get one that has these sensors on the side that tell you if there's a car in your blindspot.  It's a really useful feature for those of us who struggle with turning our heads.    I really hope you get that DSP payment.  How long before you find out?    Hey, please know you're not a failure because if you are, then a lot of really good people who are suffering would be considered failures too.  Does that make sense?  I struggle with making sense because my head hurts too much.    For me, the mornings are the worst usually.  I wake up and am already in agony so it takes a few hours to just come to terms with it.    Finally, is there anyone you can talk to about being suicidal?  If you feel like a failure, please don't.  Your post means a lot to me because I feel so alone with my troubles.  I do think that our chronic pain should be our job because it takes a lot of effort to live this way...much more effort than any normal job requires, that's for sure."
ChronicPain,3d9194,sushisay,2,Tue Jul 14 13:50:39 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry if this upset you :( It wasn't my intention.   I am going to get a new doctor. I have been thinking about it for awhile, the only reason I stayed with this guy is because I have been his patient for 15 years (off and on, I first visited him 15 years ago). He is also very quick to hand out the scripts I need. I'd hate to go to a new clinic and be denied anything that will help me.   Having said that, I think his complete lack of interest or care outweighs the benefit of script writing. My friend has a doctor she really likes and I will be trying them. I will just have to take the risk and hope that they will be able to help me instead of throw pills at me.   I try to focus on things that make me happy, or moreso things I have responsibility for. I have a dog. She is the only thing keeping me here. It would be pretty cruel to have adopted her and then left her. I stay for her.   I have never heard of cars with sensors on them on the sides. That's cool. The one I looked at has very big mirrors. I can get away with only moving minimally. I'm glad you understand thestruggle to move the head issue though. Most people think I am insane.I have no lack of function or flexibility, my neck is actually really flexible. The issue is that it effing hurts to turn it, especially multiple times or quickly. Grocery shopping is exhausting.    Hey, please know you're not a failure because if you are, then a lot of really good people who are suffering would be considered failures too. Does that make sense?   I would never think anyone else is a failure because of this. We are always the harshest on ourselves, I guess.   I do have a psychologist, but we don't really talk about it. Maybe part of me is afraid what will happen if I admit it. Will they commit me? I have visited someone in a mental institution before and it was awful. We have talked about me feeling worthless, but there isn't really quick fix for it."

If we can't be honest with complete strangers, then who can we be honest with? ;)  I just searched on Google and you can actually purchase car blind spot detectors.  I'm not sure how effective they are compared to the ones that are already on the car.  I know the new Subaru Outback has this feature.    I'm not sure about shrinks and their policy on suicidal ideation (btw, I don't like the term ideation when it's next to the word suicide).  Perhaps you can ask here on reddit.    Dogs are so incredible.  I'm so glad you have your dog and that you adopted her is even better.    Glad you're going to a new doctor.  You can always go back to the old one if you get desperate for scripts (we call them prescriptions here, so I'm guessing you're in England?).    I was going to say something else but now I've forgotten.  I think all these years of chronic daily migraines have left me with a worse memory...but it could just be that I'm getting old.  Oh and yeah, not only can't I turn my neck but just walking, I have to be so careful with how I step on the ground.  If I don't walk very carefully, my pain can go from a 6 or 7 to an 8 or 9, which is very different...although sometimes it can get that bad for no apparent reason.  A few weeks ago, my mother in law was visiting and when she gave me a kiss on the cheek, she bumped my head a bit too hard (nothing any normal person would notice at all) and I was in agony for many weeks and I hated my life more than ever.  Now I don't let anyone kiss me on the cheek unless they promise to do it very gently.  So yeah, I can relate to people thinking I must be crazy.  The only reason they don't completely thing I've lost my mind is that I have an abnormal MRI which shows my migraine on it.    Have you heard of myofacial release?  Someone here on reddit chronic pain suggested it.  It's a type of massage that can help with chronic pain.  I don't know if you can get it or if it would even help but it's one thing I haven't tried and am hoping to try one day.    Actually, I just remembered something I wanted to say.  My husband's friend was in a mental institution.  It was horrible and I was very angry at the way things were in there and I was glad once he got out of there but then a week later, he hanged himself and now I wish he had stayed there longer because even though it wasn't a great set up, maybe it would have helped him somehow.  I don't even know what I'm trying to say but I want you to find more to live for than just your dog.  It's none of my business, of course, but I do care.    I hope I'm not driving you crazy with this jumbled post but can you do your grocery shopping online?  I know we have that option here and it could save you some pain."

On the doc front, new one if possible. He sounds like a money hungry crack who lost his care for patients years ago. Find a health care team all around the listens to you. It's worth it. I went from doctors trying to commit me because they assumed it was in my head and years later I'm still trying to remind myself that I'm sane, there is a physical cause.

I don't tend to dwell on it per say, but it has made me turn away from people and things. I was planning to get a dog awhile back for instance, I was pretty excited about it for awhile, but then I decided against it knowing it would be with me for 10+ years and I may not make it that long. Same thing with a girlfriend, I've taken myself out of the dating pool for about a year now for the same reasons. It's a tough choice.   On the one hand I know those things will help keep me going, but on the other it's just more work in the case of a dog, and it's already hard to do basic things. In regard to a girl I feel like I'd be a burden and in regards to both it's just more holding me back if I did decide to go one day it would not be fair on them. I dunno, it's been a year now since I made that decision and I haven't wanted to do it, I've still got at least a few years I think if not more, and most of my relationships don't even last that long lol."

I'm in Canada where MMJ is legal, but access isn't great and fairly expensive.  I don't know how you've been taking it, but I make oil (with coconut oil) and I've been given butter. Use those to make some baked goods (peanut butter cookies seems to have the best flavour, but I haven't experimented too much), and eat a bit at a time. It takes about 20-30 min to get into your system that way, but I prefer it because I don't get high unless I eat too much.  Would you mind letting us know how things go, if you can find a good strain or two?   Oh yes, I do remember reading about some oils that were being sold in places where MMJ isn't legal. It was marketed as CBD oil (I think), but it was basically a scam. I will see if I can find any of the articles."

If people can get Charlotte's Web MJ, that's awesome! But the poster was asking both about it and about the 'CBD oil' that is sold online - which is hemp oil and ineffective.

I was specifically wondering about this http://cwbotanicals.com/charlottes-web-hemp-oil-products.html?mode=list ...made by the people who created the Charlotte's Web strain. But it's really expensive, and I can't understand how they can sell it online.   I was doing a little Googling and looking around on Reddit and found this, which listed some of the high CBD strains.  http://www.medicalseeds.com/cbd-high-strains.html  I'm just not sure how many dispensaries carry them.   Nymphetamean, I really don't have access to much pot. I'm on the older side, and I don't know many people my age who smoke it anymore (or at least admit that they do). I don't get enough or have access to enough to be experimenting. :)  I had a bad experience the last time I tried it. Initially it helped with my pain. But then I smoked it one time and I felt like it made it worse...but I think I got really paranoid and that contributed.   I might have my hopes too high. Valium really helps me--with anxiety but also the muscle relaxer helps with with the nerve pain somehow. But I have a limited supply of valium and don't want to build up a tolerance."
ChronicPain,3d6ohk,ErisGrey,3,Tue Jul 14 00:57:10 2015 UTC,"Charlottes Web is some of the best CBD stuff you can get for pain. There are many knock-offs of the stuff out there so you need to be careful. /r/CBD has a lot of great advice if you are interested in pursuing that option. I personally switched to high cbd strains I grow for myself in California.   Every year there are different strains with different levels of THC and CBD. Smoking isn't always required. You can make edibles, make capsules, concentrates. There are a dozen different ways, most all are better than smoking for health reasons. I personally grow CBD Shark, which runs equal levels of THC and CBD. I've tried higher CBD strains such as Harley Quinn but couldn't find breeders or seeds to grow myself.   Most collectives in mmj states should have the cannabis broken down by type. Unfortunately you will only really ever have 2 choices on the type of really high CBD strains they carry at one time.   I've never shopped from medicalseeds.com, so I can't vouch for them. However, those prices seem super inflated. I add to my seed bank twice a year, always buying some top genetics/cup winners. Purchasing 16 seeds, plus 17 free seeds I got for frequent shopper/bonus buys, for only $154 counting stealth shipping.   There are so many strains and breeders around the world, you can find something equally effective for less than half the price if you shop around."
ChronicPain,3d6ohk,WhiskeyHeart,3,Tue Jul 14 05:19:12 2015 UTC,Refer to /r/medicalmarijuana. Lots of really good information and experienced people there regarding different strains for different kinds of pain releif.

ChronicPain,3d6ohk,getmaimed,2,Tue Jul 14 10:35:08 2015 UTC,"I live in Seattle and the best advice I can give you is when you get here either just go to a good recreational place and then talk to the budtender, they will recommend the best strain they have available. The high CBD strains are rarer and they usually only have one or two available at a time, so even if you get a specific strain recommendation here on Reddit, it will be near impossible to find that exact strain when you come. You can also get online and look at the stores inventory, they usually update their menu's daily and will give you info on all their products, including g what CBD oils and strains you can get that day. I would try CBD oil capsules if you can find them when your here, they work really well for me for fibromyalgia pain. I also smoke high thc pot myself, and the CBD stuff is much better for pain and doesn't give you the stoned feeling. I like to use a bit of both myself so I'm in less pain and also am stoned enough to not care as much about the rest of the pain lol. Every place I have ever been has really friendly people working who are more than willing to answer any questions and help you pick out the best stuff. There are only a few recreational stores in Seattle at the moment anyways until next year when all the medical places become 502 compliant, so if you need a recommendation for a good place in Seattle than you should try Uncle Ike's Pot Shop on 23rd and union. They always have CBD products and are one of only like four legal recreational places around. Most people from out of town have a tough time finding a place that isn't medical when they come here, which requires a state medical license to even enter. If you have any questions I can maybe answer you can PM me!"

I use a MagicButter machine to make my coconut oil. Then make brownies with the oil. Just substitute the oil in the recipe with your DIY CBD/THC oil. Use the same amounts. Freeze most of the brownies. Get a very good gram scale from Amazon. I recommend the AWS for about $20. Calculate your dose. My brownie mix (from Costco) gives me a good pain relief dose at 7 grams of brownie. Be very cautious testing doses. It can take up to three hours for full effects to hit. (My first over dose had me thinking I'd had a stroke. I was out of it for 36 hours, never again). You have to eat your CBC/THC. Smoking it is really difficult to dose and short lived. Good luck."
ChronicPain,3d5uzy,workerdaemon,6,Mon Jul 13 19:35:11 2015 UTC,"I spent 5 years taking percocet and morphine pills nearly every day, multiple times a day. Since I actually needed them for significant pain management, it wasn't hard for me to obtain the help I needed. As long as I kept seeing the same doctor and signed a pain management contract. The medication had many benefits for me with virtually zero negative side effects. So I can relate to the desire to crave more once the dosage wears off. They gave me a sense of confidence, energy, euphoria and the ability to overcome most social anxieties. But the pain was always still there. I never took my meds in any other way then rx'd, I generally never took more then I needed to in a single day. Ultimately, the positive effects started to diminish. My body felt starved, uncomfortable and was obviously trying to tell me something. So one day. I just quit..Cold turkey..Which was a bad idea! I wont go into details. But the effects of quitting without medical guidance is a dangerous and stupid thing to do. So what I'm trying to say, is you have a very legitimate fear, and if you can help it. Please try to seek another form of relief, and continue to peruse any possible underlying issues that may be causing the headaches..Maybe ask for some Cymbalta? I take it for depression, but it also has some good pain management qualities as well..Good luck!"
ChronicPain,3d5uzy,vanteal,3,Mon Jul 13 20:14:40 2015 UTC,"I've read a lot of stories like yours, which is why I am extremely tentative to start taking pain medication daily. I have taken 2 Norco and a Tramadol in the past 3 hours, which is just insane.  I'm facing this incredibly difficult choice: pain now, or potential pain later with additional frustration from doctors.   I'm also frustrated with my doctors. Lidocaine nasally makes both my pain and fatigue go away. I have asked them to work with me on a nerve block, but all I got was an increase to my gabapentin. Sigh.   I've been on anti depressants since before this happened. I have tried more anti depressants, but it triggered a seizure. We do have plans to change my meds rather than add on to them, but now I believe I have a pinched nerve so I am working on trying to get nerve blocks and surgery right now."
ChronicPain,3d5uzy,vanteal,5,Mon Jul 13 21:03:10 2015 UTC,"It's unfortunate how people with legitimate pain are asked to dance through hoops before they're able to obtain any kind of relief. Especially with narcotics. In your case, I'm willing to bet if you continue down the course of narcotics, that the hoops you will be forced to jump through will only add to your pain and act as a severe trigger. The havoc they reek on your body and the potential damage they can do just isn't worth the struggle. And you can easily be labeled a ""Seeker"", and then it's even harder to get pain medication. I must of just been lucky in that the Cymbalta does just enough to limit my pain to a dull roar..I was given every muscle relaxer and non narcotic pain medication available. When nothing worked and I was spending most of my time crippled in bed. They finally let me have the real deal pain meds..I wish I could of gone back and continued to seek other treatments ""besides the surgery constantly suggested to me""...It's just not worth it. Please keep looking and asking about forms of treatment before you give in to narcotic medication..."

Not entirely sure what you mean by this, but this pain just won't stop. Not everybody suffers from any long term side effects of some of the meds and you could be facing pain now and pain later, no matter what. You can always use an opioid rotation, I have to do that because of my rapid tolerance. But I use the lowest doses of some strong meds, and none of the meds really touch my pain more than a point."

ChronicPain,3d5uzy,bittybrains,2,Wed Jul 15 00:48:07 2015 UTC,"It sounds like one option could be to be put on a long acting opioid with some breakthrough mess like lidocaine sprays and oral meds for the breathing pain.  I'm a veteran of chronic pain, and the situation you describes sounds absolutely terrible.  You deserve to be able to test out  various tools. While I can't speak for everyone else, I've found many of the dire warnings about opioids to be somewhat overblown,(not that you shouldn't be careful) especially for people whose lives have already been destroyed by chronic pain.  You can get opioids in different delivery systems.  If you have constant pain, Vicodin might actually be more risky since it's a breakthrough med.  also these days, they even have meds that can cancel out the worst side effects of opioid pain meds.  That said, you really do want to work through every single other option before resorting to opioid based pain meds.  Also i see that you may have trigeminal neuralgia, I'm no expert but I'm think this antidepressant called Cymabalta is effective for that, possibly more effective than opioid pain meds.  Also, if it is nerve pain, I believe methadone is the best of the opioid class.  Just remember, the public view on these drugs is insane, all these drugs effect everyone differently. I remember reading about one drug in the newspaper as if it was the end all pain med, when I tried it for my pain, I just had a feeling of anxiety, restlessness, and a sped-up feeling -junked the entire bottle immediately.  This is why your pain doc needs to listen to you.  Good luck, I really hope you see an improvement in your situation."

I used to write really well and I can see a huge difference. I don't spell very well - I even went to a neurologist because I was getting worried. I failed a whole bunch of tests he had. some I did very well on but many of them I was just shit at. He said Lyrica can effect things like that sometimes.  I dont know if I've just ended up using it as a scapegoat but it didn't help enough to risk it anymore.  I don't feel a difference in my pain level from not taking it.

I felt like all it did was make me sleepy and done nothing for my pain. That's a bold statement I know, but it was that shit. I just felt the same pain but also tired and confused."
ChronicPain,3d72vx,IAMLEAVING,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:10:38 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your response. I appreciate your honesty about your experience, since I know it can be difficult to accept that something your hope is going to help just falls flat."
ChronicPain,3d72vx,IAMLEAVING,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:04:13 2015 UTC,"Also I was doing 400mg three times a day for a year.  But 90% of the time, skip all my doses but the night dose as I couldn't function. From breaking my back I have shooting pains that run down my left thigh (the least of my problems) and it just didn't work. I've found the pain comes regardless as it's a movement issue of ""arching"" or pushing my pelvis forward.  It gives me pain 100% of the time no matter what."
ChronicPain,3d72vx,QuasiQwazi,1 point,Thu Jul 16 09:05:18 2015 UTC,"Zero problems for me getting off Lyrica, just had to be done gradually.  My experience. The drug made me into one of the walking dead, with no pain relief, didn't like it at all."
ChronicPain,3d72vx,dyliecious,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:39:59 2015 UTC,"Wow, that sounds like a difficult time, but I am happy that you didn't have what many Lyrica users call the ""Lyrica withdrawal hell."" How long did it take you to taper off, or did you just stop? If you don't mind me asking, how much were you taking?"
ChronicPain,3d6phb,skeeter_hater,2,Mon Jul 13 23:15:41 2015 UTC,"I can't speak to the withdrawal question, but can comment that my quality of life has improved with Butrans. Of course everyone's physiology is different (as evidenced by u/FailedTech's experience) so you generally need to do a lot of trail and error with pain meds. And unfortunately opiates/opiods aren't as effective for chronic pain as acute pain, and this leads to a lot of skewed expectations and dashed hopes. But having said that, even a small decrease in pain can mean big things for your quality of life, so the frustration of trying to find something that works to some degree and that your body ca.n tolerate is worth it.  I would talk to your doctor about your concerns with the withdrawal process, and try to nail down that he or she will be available (within reason, of course) during the process if you're struggling.  Best of luck!"
ChronicPain,3d6phb,Rangerbear,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:29:26 2015 UTC,"Thank you. So far I've had very few, if any W/D symptoms and my last dose of morph was 36+ hours ago. I don't ""feel"" the Butrans patch, but it has definitely helped me with pain already. I'm anxious to see how tonite goes and into tomorrow."
ChronicPain,3d6phb,FailedTech,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:29:23 2015 UTC,"I did not have a good reaction to it, but that is me."
ChronicPain,3d6phb,FailedTech,2,Mon Jul 13 23:44:42 2015 UTC,"Would you mind elaborating? Did it push W/Ds on harder, or did you not get pain releif?   I have had an awful time with hydromorph and oxymorph, and hydro doesn't do shit for me anymore (Zohydro made me ill too). Morphine is the only thing that has been effective to ease pain, though its short acting - it just doesn't mess me up like the newer, patented products. I also have stomach problems so I can never go back to Vico-anything."
ChronicPain,3d6phb,FailedTech,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:56:36 2015 UTC,"After two weeks of being on a patch it would trigger manic episodes. I would get irritable and feel really weird, not act like myself.  I took it for pain only and this was before they discovered I had a tumor. I am now on nucynta and it works very well for my type of pain. My doc also said nucynta withdrawls are usually mild, I do not know how true that is but I have been through vicodin withdrawls before and that was not fun."
ChronicPain,3d6phb,potpastor,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:09:48 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the additional info. I'm sorry you've had to deal with what you had and I wish you the best of luck. Whenever I hear others' stories I'm always reminded that for now I'm quite lucky that my back problems are not too severe, but I still can remember 6 years ago when I didn't have pain during every waking and sleeping moment. Life was much better...if only for the lack of hurt, and not also for the constant judgement and assumptions that others lay upon chronic pain sufferers (including doctors) and the stress that comes from trying to manage pain and dealing with suspicious doctors who have to watch their asses because of the addicts and junkies that ruin things for everyone and ""concerned"" loved ones who have no comprehension of constant, nagging, debillitating pain.  I've never heard of nucynta, but I'm happy to learn it works for you. W/Ds from any opiate suck, but I fear the newer, patented ones are even worse to deal with once one quits. My doc gave me a coupon for the Butrans, and it basically says ""the first one is free...and after that I'll give you a discount, temporarily."" Shitty ethics, but from a business practice standpoint its ingenious. And sinister.   Thanks again for your help. Peace to you."
ChronicPain,3d6phb,QuasiQwazi,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:32:04 2015 UTC,"I am very lucky in the places I have gotten treatment at.  The Pain clinic I go to was one of the places that did a study on Nucynta and the doctor was very knowledgeable.  So, I have a little more faith in him that the W/D for Nucynta are not nearly a bad as the older opiates. In fact, Vicodin/oxycodone and similar do not cross tolerance over to Nucynta. So when I quit those to go on Nucynta I hat to deal with the Vico withdrawls. Luckily nucynta kept the bodyaches down but definitely not the stomach issues. -- So it is entirely possible that the W/D are not like normal opiates."
ChronicPain,3d53fv,Window_to_your_heart,10,Mon Jul 13 16:22:12 2015 UTC,"It doesn't help my pain at all, but it knocks me out like crazy. I actually dislike it and only take it when desperate."
ChronicPain,3d53fv,lll_lll_lll,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:07:50 2015 UTC,Thanks for your input. I seem to be one of the few that it doesn't make sleepy.
ChronicPain,3d53fv,godofallcows,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:18:35 2015 UTC,"Exact same here, I take it when I'm having trouble sleeping or if I don't want to be conscious in pain."
ChronicPain,3d53fv,FF00A7,3,Mon Jul 13 19:38:16 2015 UTC,Ringing in the ears is a common side effect of chronic pain. It's one way I measure how severe my pain is how bad the ringing is. Also can be influenced by ear wax in fact I am going to get my yearly ear wax removal and that always helps some (ear nose and throat doctor).
ChronicPain,3d53fv,tim1967,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:36:39 2015 UTC,"Now that you mention it, the ringing is worse when my pain gets wo se. Thank you."
ChronicPain,3d53fv,Myfourcats1,3,Mon Jul 13 17:01:15 2015 UTC,I had ringing in my ears and the docs said I had to go off it as it can be become  permanent. Talk to your doc you may have to switch meds.
ChronicPain,3d53fv,FailedTech,2,Mon Jul 13 18:06:53 2015 UTC,"Good info to know, thank you! I am adding that to my questions for my doctor tomorrow."
ChronicPain,3d53fv,M153RY,3,Mon Jul 13 19:10:52 2015 UTC,Yes it helps me. Knocks me out. Doesn't cause ringing. My hydrocodone does cause tinnitus though.
ChronicPain,3d53fv,M153RY,2,Mon Jul 13 19:10:55 2015 UTC,I have had the ringing longer than I have been on hydrochodone but it may be making things worse. Thanks for the heads up.
ChronicPain,3d53fv,Mechiko,2,Mon Jul 13 19:15:22 2015 UTC,"Made me sleepy, insanely sleepy."
ChronicPain,3d53fv,Mechiko,3,Mon Jul 13 16:49:20 2015 UTC,"I wish it had that effect on me, then I wouldn't deal with insomnia."
ChronicPain,3d53fv,Mechiko,2,Mon Jul 13 17:02:00 2015 UTC,"I've had my battles with insomnia, usually i wake up at 6:00am, have a couple cups of coffee, it seems the caffeine early in the morning helps wear myself out during the day. If i wake up any later than 8, or don't have any caffeine in the morning, i won't sleep. It's tough to deal with, but if you find what works for you, use it. I take flexeril when I'm out of my other meds, if i take it before dinner, or on an empty stomach, it helps me sleep"
ChronicPain,3d53fv,slientmalice,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:41:21 2015 UTC,Insomnia sucks. I have caffeine before mid-afternoon. I take the cyclobenzaprine in the early evening and then diazepam at bedtime. I still have bouts of insomnia. I used to take Lunesta on those occasions but it (& it's generic) are over $300. Now I have tea with a little mmj infused coconut oil in it. That helps me get better sleep more than anything else I have tried. I do take two hydrochodone a day and I try not to take any after five because they seem to keep me up. I do take tramadol at bedtime but I don't care for it.
ChronicPain,3d53fv,slientmalice,2,Mon Jul 13 18:05:04 2015 UTC,"Hydrocodone takes my pain down a few notches, but i get insanely high off of it, and it upsets my stomach it doesn't help me sleep either, so i try to not take it after midday."
ChronicPain,3d53fv,JessticlesLeigh,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:19:29 2015 UTC,It is amazing how differently people can react to meds. I don't get a high from hydrochodone. Though that used to be the case when not taking it regularly. If it is working on pain it doesn't get me high. I do have to take it with food as well. It is nasty if I don't.
ChronicPain,3d53fv,JessticlesLeigh,2,Mon Jul 13 19:09:09 2015 UTC,"I take 10mg three times a day, it doesn't make me sleepy or anything. It does help with my muscle spasms in my back, most of the time. When it gets super bad it's not enough, but I definitely feel it wearing off towards the end of its six hours."
ChronicPain,3d53fv,JessticlesLeigh,2,Mon Jul 13 19:41:17 2015 UTC,Interesting. Maybe I need to change the timing of my doses. Ten mg every 12 hours maybe? Another question to add to my list for my doctor. Thank you.
ChronicPain,3d53fv,JessticlesLeigh,2,Mon Jul 13 21:42:02 2015 UTC,Mine is every 6 hours.
ChronicPain,3d53fv,rainbow_butterfly,2,Tue Jul 14 21:01:55 2015 UTC,I am switching to 10mg three times a day. I hope it helps & I don't need Vicodin as often. Thanks for bringing it up or I may not have asked my doctor about it.
ChronicPain,3d53fv,banjaxe,2,Wed Jul 15 02:03:54 2015 UTC,Fingers crossed that it helps you :)
ChronicPain,3d53fv,banjaxe,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:51:28 2015 UTC,Thanks. :)
ChronicPain,3d53fv,wildgreengirl,2,Wed Jul 15 21:08:26 2015 UTC,I'm taking Flexeril right now and it's a joke to me. All it does is makes me sleepy. Now at one point I was taking Zanaflex and it works better than Flexeril IMO. The only downside with Zanaflex is that it knocks me out I would sleep the  whole day away.
ChronicPain,3d53fv,wildgreengirl,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:31:36 2015 UTC,"If you took it at night time only, do you think the Zanaflex would still be helpful for the pain? I feel like the cyclobenzaprine may maintain my normal muscle pain but if it flares up it feels worthless. At least it doesn't cost too much."
ChronicPain,3d53fv,wildgreengirl,2,Mon Jul 13 21:39:24 2015 UTC,I think it would but I also take Amitriptyline as well but that's on the only as needed bases. So I really don't take it as much unless I'm in unbearable pain.
ChronicPain,3d53fv,JessticlesLeigh,2,Tue Jul 14 05:46:36 2015 UTC,It actually used to help me but then I started having blackouts on it. Not fun at all and very frightening not being able to remember what you did for sometimes an entire day. So I'm not allowed to take any type of muscle relaxant anymore.
ChronicPain,3d53fv,Dalekette,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:47:29 2015 UTC,That is terrifying. I would stay away from it as well if I were you. My pain doctor said the best medicine for muscle spasms is Valium. I do take 20mg at bedtime only. Helps me sleep unless I am having a bout of insomnia. Maybe that would be an option for you to ask your doctor about. It doesn't work well to take during the day though.
ChronicPain,3d53fv,just_me_29,2,Tue Jul 14 02:02:00 2015 UTC,That's the really depressing part isn't it? 90% of the drugs that do help make you sleep or you can't take during the day because they make you too drowsy. The other 10% cause potential death.
ChronicPain,3d53fv,just_me_29,1 point,Wed Jul 15 07:14:28 2015 UTC,"I am honestly considering moving to a fully legal marijuana state at my doctor's advice. I use mmj for gastroparesis which causes slow motility, nausea and lack of appetite & the symptoms can be severe. It is the only medication you can't overdose on. There are still side effects and of course, two for me are sleepiness & being dehydrated. I can't be stoned all of the time but once a day on good days get me through the day. I want access to low THC and high cannabinoids for my muscle pain and gastroparesis symptoms. My doctor suggested a fully legal state because a pain clinic wouldn't be able to discriminate against me for using marijuana & it truly is helping me stay alive. I need to make sure that is true. There are few options to help gastroparesis and I have tried the two medications that are used for it so a good portion of us with this condition turn to mmj. Thanks for your input!"
ChronicPain,3d3jv6,netbich,6,Mon Jul 13 06:10:28 2015 UTC,"Ugh. That's not so much an article, but a short string of words with a picture.   Also, I think people mix correlation and causation. Is there a relation? Of course. But how is that any different than saying addicts are 40x more likely to try and get opioid prescriptions?   Or, let's look at a different medicine. Let's say I go to a doctor and was put on an anti-depressant. I am still depressed and end up killing myself. Does that mean that antidepressants make me more at risk for suicide, or is there AN UNDERLYING CAUSE other than the medicine?? Hmmmm..."
ChronicPain,3d3jv6,idontgetbacon,3,Mon Jul 13 15:29:41 2015 UTC,Didn't they determine that some antidepressants DO actually increase risk of suicide?
ChronicPain,3d3jv6,rainbow_butterfly,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:32:52 2015 UTC,"Yes, but not all. I'm just saying generalization hurts everything, not just opioid drugs."
ChronicPain,3d3jv6,idontgetbacon,10,Mon Jul 13 23:42:00 2015 UTC,"So according to this article myself and probably a lot of you on this sub are 40 time more likely to become heroin addicts.  40 times!!!  This reminds of the reefer madness film from the 1930's. If you've never seen it, click the link. Don't be taking a drink of anything while you watch it. There's a risk of you spitting it all over your monitor as you watch it.   I see no sources sited, just a nifty little graphic that will no doubt cause a lot of us grief.

Not to mention, that when students in school had to take those ""Predicting the Future"" or whatever anonymous surveys, I remember hearing that people put that they had done all of stuff: x, y ,z because ""it sounds cool"". It shows how inaccurate the data may likely be.  The facts are, we can sit here and complain, that's easier. The other way is to advocate. I wish I knew a constructive positive way to do this, w/o ranting and it would actually make a point (a professional appeal/letter, signed by thousands), or something of the like."

ChronicPain,3d3jv6,jodycwilliams,10,Mon Jul 13 21:31:16 2015 UTC,"Honestly I think the article is not that far from truth (braces for downvotes) on the link between prescription opioids and illegal narcotics addiction.   Having experienced the Veteran's Administration hospitals first-hand, the first thing they do when you go in and complain about pain-- any pain-- is write a prescription for opioid pain killers. They hand them out like Tic-Tacs with the hope that you will just you go away because they have so many other people to see and they don't want to be bothered with you.  So many veterans end up hooked on opioids because they were given them so freely. Eventually some admin looks over their file and says, ""Hey, this guy's been getting Codeine refills every month for the last five years; he's clearly just abusing them. He should be better by now; nobody has pain that lasts that long.""  So they refuse to refill his prescription any more, and because he probably actually has become addicted by then, and because he also probably still has chronic pain, he will look anywhere he can for a substitute, and often that substitute turns out to be a narcotic. So many of the homeless vets you see on the streets are addicts because of this problem. So many of them were started on opioids that their doctors gave them.  The article is still a joke, though, for other reasons."
ChronicPain,3d3jv6,godofallcows,7,Mon Jul 13 09:05:42 2015 UTC,"My friend (double BKA) and I (single BKA) can't get them to refill meds we've been on without a problem for a decade.  Why?  Overdose fears.  I even had to take a class just to refill it and still have major issues.  I was told by my PCP that I ""chew them like candy"" even though I've voluntarily reduced my prescription from 2 10/325s 3x daily to 1 5/325 3x daily in the span of 8 months.     Yes, it was once easy.  No, it is not anymore.  As the government always does, the VA has overreacted and is punishing actual pain patients so they can meet quotas.  I was told by my doc she has to report to her boss for every single refill and justify it.  Bureaucracy has taken the place of common sense.    Edit:  PS most of the VA patients I know have taken up weed because it is easier to get.  I can't stand the stuff so I'm screwed."
ChronicPain,3d3jv6,sniggity,3,Mon Jul 13 14:26:45 2015 UTC,"I chose TriCare instead of the VA when I medically retired, I'm shelling out $12 copays left and right like nobody's business but I'm not sitting in a line at least."
