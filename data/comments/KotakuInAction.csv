KotakuInAction,3e4shp,YetAnotherCommenter,3,Wed Jul 22 07:39:56 2015 UTC,How much of that Patreon money is the IRS supposed to get?
KotakuInAction,3e4shp,Y2KNW,58,Wed Jul 22 00:14:41 2015 UTC,"Sorta depends on how it's set up, but if the money goes straight to her and not a non-profit organization or something (the patreon page is unclear but looks like it goes straight to her) then it should be reported and taxed just like regular income. Making some basic assumptions which are probably wrong (no deductions, no other income, etc) approximately $5,500 would go to federal income tax.  Edit: got my math a little wrong, and said she'd owe the IRS about 4k. I believe the new figure ($5,500) is more correct, though still very much an approximation."
KotakuInAction,3e4shp,falconic,38,Wed Jul 22 01:10:48 2015 UTC,"She'd likely owe more than that. Patreon would presumably fall under self-employment, meaning she'd have to pay the self-employment tax, which is the equivalent of both the employer and employee share of payroll taxes (for Social Security and Medicare). That alone would be roughly 15%, or about $6,000.   Some of that would be deductible, so her taxable income would then be lower than $40,000 (before the standard deductions presuming she doesn't itemize). Rough estimate about $3,000 income tax on top of SE. Plus whatever state/local taxes. Best guess $9-$11 to the various taxmen."
KotakuInAction,3e4shp,Grst,20,Wed Jul 22 03:40:32 2015 UTC,"There is a very good chance you're right, I'm not sure. I didn't think it would fall under self-employment tax, since it's not really a business, it's hardly like she's doing anything in return for the money really. I was thinking about it more like a tip. I'm definitely not an expert though."
KotakuInAction,3e4shp,falconic,22,Wed Jul 22 04:00:58 2015 UTC,"While she is self-employed, I don't believe patreon money works that way.  The money given too her via patreon is closer, I assume, to trust-fund money. As it's money that's received from someone else simply because you exist.   But then again, I'm not sure... Anyone know how patreon works?"
KotakuInAction,3e4shp,jroth005,9,Wed Jul 22 06:27:46 2015 UTC,"I've been wondering about  this process for a while. I've been looking around and this was the best response / explanation I have found.   Donations, particularly those in the context of you providing a free service (software, libraries, etc.) are a notable grey area in tax code.  Simply naming a button ""Donate"" doesn't necessarily classify the money transfer as a ""gift"". The IRS can decide that it's money you're being paid to continue your excellent work/service, making it taxable income (unless you're a registered non-profit organization).  In the instance of Patreon, and many other crowd-funding services, you're providing a certain level of ""service"" for each tier of donations (such as early access or something, I'm not sure what you're offering), which means they're receiving consideration for their donations, which most likely makes it fall into taxable income (again, unless you're a registered non-profit organization).   So since her account is setup suggesting that supporting her allows her to write more tools it would be considered income."

My ability to empathize is powerful, and her past is very troubled, and I got to read it in her own bare-knuckled words.  Doesn't excuse her behavior now... but I get her now in ways I couldn't understand before.  I didn't even read many of Milo's comments... he clearly doesn't like her much, which would be ok, but he spends too much time trying to make quotable pithy quips that some may see as clever, but I see as petty.  Milo: Good work outing this, it needed to happen, but if you want the respect of someone like me, you need to actually be the adult in the room.  In terms of realpolitik, she should not to be hated or vilified - she should be ignored, pitied, just politely denied a seat at the table.  That's all.  EDIT: Thanks Milo.  I didn't anticipate a direct response.  However, it made me re-read, and I realized I did the same thing you did.  I constructed a pithy... well you get it.

Now the cocaine and meth and (very probable) abuse of adderal? All not good for your heart, but two of those are much more dangerous than the other."

Aerobic exercise is definitely a great, short-term boost to attention. Along with medication and CBT, exercise is a fundamental part to treatment. Science agrees with you there.  However, it is silly to argue that your experience with health somehow trumps the findings from one of the largest clinical dataset on ADHD patients in the world (which Barkley works on). The statistics clearly indicate patients with ADHD are at very high risk for certain diseases and obesity is one of them.  ADHD is not only kids bouncing off of walls, even though that may be the extent of your experience with it. It is by and large an executive functioning problem: the same symptoms that lead to forgetting to pay bills on time can (and do!) also lead to impaired regulation of dieting and exercise which lead to obesity and obesity-related illnesses.

KotakuInAction,3e4shp,AwesomeInTheory,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:43:25 2015 UTC,"Big difference.   The claims about Randi Harper already existed -- Milo investigated them and, as we saw in part 2, debunked a couple of them. Harper is a public figure who talks about specific things and does so because she feels that she is on the moral or 'right' side to be doing so.   It's kind of hard to be an advocate of diversity when you're insulting Mexicans.  It's also kind of hard to be about 'equality in the workplace' or 'more women in the workplace' when you've demonstrated that your reasons for doing so might have ulterior motives. Are you saying that because that's what you truly believe, or because you are an unemployable trainwreck with a whole host of substance abuse and social issues?  Ultimately, it's kind of hard to be this open-minded, moralistic, free thinking type when it's been demonstrated that your true character is pretty much the antithesis of what you're portraying yourself as. Why is that important? Well, when you're influencing policy on websites like Twitter, you may have cause for concern.   While what the Conde Nast CFO allegedly did (there hasn't been a way to verify that everything the gay hooker sourced to Gawker yet, AFAIK) is morally wrong and should be condemned, I don't think that there was any burning need for the public to know about his infidelities -- he was just one guy out of a bunch who was cheating on his wife.   It's also kind of hard to denounce your critics as being ""100% full of shit"" when people who have looked into it have determined that, while there may be some bullshit going on, the major claims about you that you are claiming are false are actually true."

Woman call all men ""dumb"" because that's what they call anything they don't understand. It'd be like someone who likes classical music calling metal dumb. Even if they're actually related. Even though there's plenty of beauty and complexity in metal... they don't ever dive into it so they deride and dismiss it. They don't bother to understand something different from themselves because if they don't understand it, everyone must be stupid.  So they take things like:  The need to compete? They think it's violence.  The need to shit talk? They think it's bullying.  The fact that men can look at other women and not cheat? It blows their minds that men can actually feel pleasure just seeing a woman of beauty... and that's it.  The list goes on.  The reason they think women get bullied out of games is they mistake normal shit talking for something much more aggressive... because it would be that much more aggressive if it was coming from a fellow woman--since they're normally much more passive with their threats."
KotakuInAction,3e28oc,Katastic_Voyage,62,Tue Jul 21 19:21:08 2015 UTC,"It's what happens when a bunch of women get into male spaces and some fail to understand it.  Gaming has always been competitive. I can't even begin to count the amount of times I was called various names and derogatory remarks, but it doesn't fucking matter. You get insulted all the time, and it takes a special type of person to actually take offense to that. I mean, do you really it it personally that some dude you don't know, halfway across the country, called you a faggot? Really?   It's not that we hate women. With gaming being a predominantly male hobby, it's going to have elements of masculinity, competitiveness, and testosterone floating about. When people shit talk, they will use any sort of ""weakness"" that you have and attack it. If you're unskilled, you're a noob/scrub. If you're an obvious underaged child, you get called a kid. If someone needs a quick all-purpose insult, you're now a faggot.  When some women see this, they immediately think that it needs to change to fit their worldview. To them, these insults are simply unacceptable, and are ""x-phobic"" or whatever tumblr buzzword they feel like using today. Never mind the fact that gaming was born from a bunch of socially awkward men who carved out their own space with their own culture and lingo. No, now you have to cater to ME, because I'm a GIRL."

KotakuInAction,3e28oc,EAT_DA_POOPOO,19,Tue Jul 21 23:09:06 2015 UTC,"It depends on how literally you take it I suppose...  It's a little colourful, but in essence it's about meritocracy to me. Online and especially in games it doesn't matter if you are a girl. Your gaming skills matter and if you are a good team player nobody is going to hold your gender against you.  OTOH, if you make your gender an issue and try to use it to gain an advantage, the whole post tits or gtfo bit is a way to let you know what people think about trying to use your gender as an advantage.  It's all a little simplified and I suppose teenage hormones play a large role in the whole thing, but there is a certain kind of justice in the fact that if you bring up your gender you're going to be called out on it."
KotakuInAction,3e28oc,nodeworx,8,Tue Jul 21 23:24:01 2015 UTC,"I mean, people can find a way to be offended by puppies if they try hard enough.

KotakuInAction,3e28oc,EAT_DA_POOPOO,17,Wed Jul 22 00:13:03 2015 UTC,"I'm a bit confused by the general acceptance of the idea that games are ""male spaces"" in this conversation. The internet and gaming are mainstream as fuck nowadays, and women have been using both for many years. You just don't notice most of us because we aren't bouncing around with flashing arrows that scream ""PAY ATTENTION TO ME"". We're here though; I've met a ton of fellow women. I don't think gender is the issue."
KotakuInAction,3e28oc,VikingNipples,22,Tue Jul 21 20:58:24 2015 UTC,"Well, take a look at League of Legends as an example. A few years ago (2012), Riot released a bunch of demographic information, and it showed that at least 90% of League's playerbase is male.   Coming from the Doom community, it's a sausage fest. Always has been, and continues to be to this day.  If you go to SpeedRunsLive, essentially a Twitch speedrunning stream aggregation site, you'll find a huge male majority.  That's a huge range of gaming environments. In fact, the only time I can say I've experienced relatively equal numbers of men and women in gaming was in a now-essentially-defunct Zelda fansite, and that only applies to their staff. Even then, it still wasn't an even split for staff or for site visitors.  Gaming is called a male space because, well, it is. The only time the demographics start evening out is when you start generalizing so much that your numbers are now completely worthless for anything other than pushing an ideology. Yes, you can include grandma playing a crossword game on her phone alongside a college-age dude grinding out Super Mario World hours every day so he can beat it faster than anyone in the world has done before, but all you've done is shown the difference between two entirely different kinds of gaming. It doesn't mean grandma is also trying to beat the SMW world record."
KotakuInAction,3e28oc,AkiraZXE,5,Tue Jul 21 21:32:20 2015 UTC,"Males dominate certain areas of gaming, but females dominate other areas, and areas where the genders are equal exist as well. You noted it yourself: competitive communities have more men, and puzzle/social communities have more women. Then you look at co-op PvE games like WoW, and I meet as many women as men.  I don't think the problem is about men vs. women, but about misunderstanding varying subcultures. While the fighting game community is dominated by men, there are still a lot of women. They aren't masculine or trans, they just understand how to interact in the subculture that they're a part of, and their sex/gender has nothing to do with it. Plenty of men outside the FGC see it as being very crass and aggressive."
KotakuInAction,3e28oc,VikingNipples,4,Tue Jul 21 21:52:13 2015 UTC,"Males dominate certain areas of gaming, but females dominate other areas   While accurate this is misleading. The areas that males dominate consist of the vast majority of gaming revenue and most of what people think of when you mention ""gaming"".  Women on the other hand are more common than men only in a few genera that sell far, far less and are typically non competitive.  Once you get into mobile gaming the spread is so diverse that it includes everyone in more equal amounts. Of course, aside from a few outliers, the majority of the revenue in this market is also male."
KotakuInAction,3e28oc,haneybird,3,Wed Jul 22 01:29:55 2015 UTC,What does revenue have to do with anything? We were talking about social interaction.   The areas that males dominate consist of the vast majority of gaming revenue [...] the majority of the revenue in [the mobile] market is also male   Got data to back up that claim?   Once you get into mobile gaming the spread is so diverse that it includes everyone in more equal amounts.   So you agree that it's not male-dominated.  Not everyone has a narrow definition of gaming. You seem to be latching onto competitive scenes like they're the only legitimate gamers.

It would make sense why they mentioned some things in the article but not others knowing this.  The study isn't saying that male players aren't insulted.  What it seems to be supporting is that male players are treated more generically with less variance when their deaths are low, and kills don't matter so much.  For females, kills reduce insults and deaths increase them.  I'd speculate the lower-performing females would get a response like ""oh great, someone's girlfriend is on our team.  We're fucked"", while the higher-performing ones would get something like ""wow, this girl can actually play!  That's amazing!""  I can see why being treated differently because of your genetics would feel shitty, but on the other hand it does suggest that playing better would get you more positive and less negative comments, and that gender isn't a huge issue unless you have an extremely good or extremely bad game."

KotakuInAction,3e28oc,AndaliteBandit,12,Tue Jul 21 16:17:36 2015 UTC,"http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0131613#sec009  There is the actual study.    For the examination of negative statements, there were two focal players in the female-voiced manipulation that made 10 more negative statements than the next highest individuals (greater than 5 standard deviations from the mean). As a result, we removed them from our analysis to ensure they did not skew our results towards significance. Focal players stated more negative statements in the female-voiced (2.66±0.36) compared to the male-voiced manipulation (1.90±0.34, χ2 = 5.88, p = 0.0015; Table 1). The maximum skill level achieved by focal players was negatively correlated with the number of negative statements (β = -0.18, χ2 = 3.99, p = 0.046). There was also a significant interaction of the manipulation with both measures of focal player performance. Overall, there were a greater number of negative comments made by focal players in both manipulations as they died more often (i.e. their team performance decreased). However, focal players made a greater number of negative statements in the female-voiced manipulation when dying less (i.e. greater performance), and a greater number of negative statements in the male-voiced manipulation when dying extremely often (i.e. very poor performance) (β = 0.28, χ2 = 5.44, p = 0.02; Fig 3). In contrast, there was no effect of individual performance (i.e. the number of kills) on the number of negative statements made by focal players in the male-voiced manipulation, but focal players in the female-voiced manipulation stated significantly more negative statements when their performance was poor (i.e. fewer kills) and stated fewer negative statements when performing exceptionally (β = 0.35, χ2 = 6.07, p = 0.014; Fig 3).  We next examined whether the number of negative statements made by focal players was correlated with their performance metrics relative to the experimental player. Again, there was also a greater number of negative statements in the female compared to the male experimental manipulation (χ2 = 7.06, p = 0.008). There was a positive correlation between the difference in deaths and the number of negative statements (β = 0.24, χ2 = 9.43, p = 0.002) with focal players that died relatively more often than the experimental player (i.e. relatively poorer team performance) making more negative comments. There was also a negative correlation between the relative difference in kills and the number of negative statements made (β = -0.16, χ2 = 5.52, p = 0.019) such that focal players that had relatively more kills than the experimental player made fewer negative comments. There was no effect of any other factors on the number of negative statements (Table 2)."
KotakuInAction,3e28oc,Strill,19,Tue Jul 21 18:16:04 2015 UTC,"For the male and female manipulations, the researchers also played in the matches as expected, but also developed a list of roughly a dozen phrases that were recorded separately by a male and female voice (S1 Text). These phrases were broadcast, during the games, to other players using the real-time voice channel. These prerecorded phrases were identical in the male and female condition, harmless in nature, and designed to be inoffensive. Phrases included: ‘I like this map’, ‘nice shot there’, ‘I had fun playing that game’, ‘I think I just saw a couple of them heading this way’, and ‘that was a good game everyone’.   These are far from inoffensive, and depend heavily on context.  ""Nice shot there""  can easily be seen as an attempt to rub salt in the wounds of another player, depending on whether it's played in response to a hit, a miss, or a death. In fact, the use of inoffensive language when one is performing exceptionally well or exceptionally poorly can easily cause it to become offensive, as can the lack of any apologies for poor performance or anti-social behavior, or the refusal to respond to someone else's comments. Without being able to control for the widely varying context of these phrases, it's impossible to glean any useful information from this. It's obvious that these researchers didn't know what they're doing.  I also find it suspicious that they didn't say what the game mode was. They rated player performance by kills and deaths. If they were playing Team Slayer, then that's correct, but if they were playing capture the flag, then their whole methodology was worthless because kills and deaths are only tangentially relevant.

One post, cropped to be the only thing she's showing, about someone saying something like that, but with tons of people calling it out, reporting it, and it ended up getting deleted. There's even proof of false flagging, because when GamerGate discussion was banned from 4chan and only allowed on 8chan, the morons didn't know there were poster IDs so people got caught doing stuff like this:  http://i.imgur.com/H2in8Wh.png  There was no actual planning on 4chan to hack, dox, or harass ZQ on 4chan. It was against the rules, and even though there were anons who suggested it, they were deleted, ignored, or called out. The same can be said for the burgerandfries IRC chat. There were users who suggested ""Hey, let's dox her"" but no one said ""Good plan, how do we go about doing that?"" Just because assholes or false flags say these things, and isn't proof ""planning"" went on, because the actual plans weren't laid out on any of there venues.   Like I said before I'm working on a much more detailed summation of the lies these LWs brought forth, and comprehensive sources to provide evidence. If you haven't see it yet, I suggest checking out the one I made for Brianna Wu, to see just how detailed I'll get.

But it just can't quite stay there lol.   I think this has to be my favorite line.   ""In contrast, there is no evidence that a woman’s fitness is determined by her position in a hierarchy, making overt hierarchical navigation less important."" - I don't think that is true. Surely evolutionary biology perspective, a man would desire a mate with the strongest indicator, be it status in ... a hierarchy ... or physical attribute, that will give advantage to his offspring being in a better position.   ""In addition, because direct conflicts are relatively more costly for women [16], women generally use more subtle competitive strategies that reduce the social status of rivals and minimize retaliation."" - That sounds ... kind of sexist. Women ... more subtle than men lol.  And then there is this ... ""Nonetheless, video games remain a bastion of sexual stereotypes and inequality for several reasons. First, men are often graphically depicted as aggressive and hypermasculine, while women are portrayed in an overly sexualized manner "" ... because hypermasculine and aggressiveness has nothing to do with sex appeal at all!   The results were pretty interesting. Higher scoring males made more positive comments to female players than lower skilled males. Behavior that might be to impress upon a potential mate. But it also have something to do with the fact that the female might provide a novelty bias to the high scoring male. He could just believe that her skill helped the team and in turn him, achieve a higher score.   Lower skilled males made more negative comments to females than lower skilled males. But extremely low skilled males were subjected more negative comments to males than females. The negative comments towards males rises and overtakes negative comments to female the more deaths a player has. How this relates to sexist attitudes would require more study because ""hated of women"" cannot explain why beyond 15 deaths, male players made more negative comments to males than females.   But the presence of ""hostile sexist statements"" actually had nothing to do skill achieved or number of kills made by the female player to relative to the male player is really what points a kink in the narrative here. The people that made truly sexist comments where just going to make them regardless.   Which I think lends to the fact that the ""novelty"" factor of a female player needs to be studied more and how that plays into the sexist perception that clearly exists. Basically, is the female player an easily recognizable factor that a player, doing well or poorly, lazily attributes to their performance.  Also ... if a Man makes more female player targeted negative comments because he perceives himself as a loser ... we'll lets have an article that calls him a loser and that will make him stop lol.  Also this article had a pretty big fat lie: (this one was from the washington post article but yahoo news said something similar).  ""no matter their skill level, or how the game went — men tended to be pretty cordial to each other.""   Which is not true as males experienced a greater number of deaths, they make more negative comments regardless of gender.   It's worth nothing that these articles pull this out of their ass as even the researchers made no allusion to this. IMO is it clearly there to support the narrative that males only subject other females to negative comments, because if males made negative comments to other males, the narrative would change as it would be advocating that women need special treatment.   TL:DR; Basically, it does point to sexist perceptions, but, honestly this is hardly a smoking gun for so many people that scream ""misogyny""."

There are any number of reasons why it might be women getting most of the abuse.  As the story indicates, women are (moreso than men) newcomers to gaming. This would suggest they're on average less skilled players. Perhaps they're getting yelled at because they're not as good.  Or, it could be a subconscious analogy for mating. Men who have been identified as low status losers are less likely to attract women, and because of that rejection (either real or merely anticipated) they lash out at women.  I'm sure you fine folk can imagine any number of other reasons why there would be a gender disparity in trash talk that has nothing to do with women invading men's space. So, even if the stats on abuse are correct (and there's good reason to think they're not), there's no reason to think it's due to the author's hypothesis."

I've had a bottom fragger telling my friend (top fragger at the time) he sucks (okay lol that actually fits the study) and I've had a butthurt ... again, bottom fragger who tried (and eventually managed) to kick me (second top) because I told him to go fuck himself and muted him after he begged for kick for 3 minutes straight. I've seen multiple instances of top fraggers (and sometimes even others) on the losing team do their dirty laundry on the all chat. The opposing team in the latest CS:GO match on de_dust2 (where else would you get rude players?) was full of obnoxious faggots insulting everyone during the warmup (and they won).  Sample size: ~73 competitive matches won, I think my win/lose ratio should be at around ~50% so that's nearly 150 games  of CS:GO (comparable to their sample size) saying otherwise.

KotakuInAction,3e3rbn,LunarArchivist,8,Wed Jul 22 02:58:40 2015 UTC,"They used a set of prerecorded messages from a male voice and a female voice.   For the male and female manipulations, the researchers also played in the matches as expected, but also developed a list of roughly a dozen phrases that were recorded separately by a male and female voice (S1 Text). These phrases were broadcast, during the games, to other players using the real-time voice channel. These prerecorded phrases were identical in the male and female condition, harmless in nature, and designed to be inoffensive. Phrases included: ‘I like this map’, ‘nice shot there’, ‘I had fun playing that game’, ‘I think I just saw a couple of them heading this way’, and ‘that was a good game everyone’.   These are far from inoffensive, and depend heavily on context. ""Nice shot there"" can easily be seen as an attempt to rub salt in the wounds of another player, depending on whether it's played in response to a hit, a miss, or a death. In fact, the use of inoffensive language when one is performing exceptionally well or exceptionally poorly can easily cause it to become offensive, as can the lack of any apologies for poor performance or anti-social behavior, or the refusal to respond to someone else's comments. Without being able to control for the widely varying context of these phrases, it's impossible to glean any useful information from this."

KotakuInAction,3e3rbn,The-red-Dane,6,Wed Jul 22 01:24:36 2015 UTC,"Haven't read the whole thing so I don't know if the article already covers this, but...  ...Even if the study results accurately reflect the social behavior of male gamers, the conclusion is still weird, to say the least, since it's centered around succeeding at video games. Being good at video games isn't exactly known as a way to attract women. If anything, skilled gamers are seen, even now, as little more than nerds by the majority. So why would any man rest his 'hierarchical status' within gaming to attract women, like, ever?   I think what's happening here, if the survey is any good, is that frustrated male gamers are more likely to lash out at female gamers precisely because they are a lot more likely to lash out at male gamers otherwise. I think men are usually a lot more aggressive toward other men, whether it's while gaming or not, and so we are a lot closer to an anger threshold when dealing with other men. The closer you get to this threshold, the harder it is to get even angrier but, when dealing with women, we are nowhere near the limit and it's easier to become more hostile.  It probably doesn't apply to the opposite sex, either, but also in relation to people you feel good will toward in general. I'm sure we've all met people who are very sociable and friendly to strangers (not in a vulgar 'nice to meet you ya cunt' way, either), who then go on to loose their shit and lash out at you when they are especially frustrated.   Of course that may only apply to straight men.   My two cents, anyway."

KotakuInAction,3e3rbn,Logan_Mac,3,Tue Jul 21 20:09:20 2015 UTC,"Now I don't play Halo or FPS games, but I do play League and Smite.  I've dealt with ragers before on numerous occasions, and the study ignores a couple big and little issues.  Most notably to me, is whether the team is winning or losing.  They look into personal performance, but don’t actually take into account whether or not the game is being won or lost.  Part of what makes a rager is the need to disperse blame on teammates.  There isn’t as much need to do so if you are winning anyway – you can’t be blamed for a loss if you don’t lose.  The surveyed commenters have a total overall w/l record of 102-45.  As two games have multiple commenters (M062709H and M062109C) the researcher’s overall record in the games with interactions with other players is 100-45 or .6896.  The researcher’s record while acting as a male however is 48-15 or .7619.  The researcher’s record while acting as a female is 52-30 or .6341.  That’s a huge discrepancy.  People receive on average about 12% more negative comments when they are on the losing team.  Since the study removed the two biggest outliers, we will too.   Average negative comments in a loss is 2.54/game Average negative comments for a win is 2.27/game Average negative comments in a loss as a male is 2.86/game   It's hard to know how relevant that last stat is though, because the sample size is literally 15 games.  People are overall more negative when they are losing. 35 users made at least 2 more negative comments to the researcher than positive ones, 20 of them in losing games.  So, 44% of commenters are predominantly negative when losing compared to 15% of players who were winning the game.  Also, the researchers didn't use an actual person on the microphone to interact with the other players.  Without them posting all the instances of abuse, I can see players getting upset when trying to communicate with a soundboard.  If the researcher played 183 games with 7 teammates per game, then they played with 1281 teammates.  By their own metric, 11 made sexist comments.  13% of games with the female voice included any sexist comments and less than 1% of the researcher's teammates used any sexist language and only about 8% of them made any negative comments. The example insults given are very similar between the male and female voice as well.    The fact that they state that women deal with ""rampant"" sexism in online environments and then admit that the number of sexist abuse they found in their study is a very small sample size though is absolutely hilarious to me.  There ARE racists, sexists, assholes, etc. in the gaming community and other predominantly male spaces.  It isn't the bulk of the community though.  The fact that they ignore that when their own numbers are saying it is getting old.  With that said, at least they acknowledge that their results go against the expectations of social constructionist theory.  TL;DR  The study isn't all garbage, but it has been taken out of context by the media.  They ignore the w/l factor though and the sample size is absolutely tiny (even if they want to say otherwise)."

""Stating something has a non-representative sample size is a flawed arguement unless you can submit your own findings with an equal or larger sample size. Otherwise as stated by Name redacted you are just trying to discredit findings. Scientific method works on a group of diverse individuals that are part of a group.""

KotakuInAction,3e3rbn,Kroljas,5,Wed Jul 22 05:07:27 2015 UTC,"No. With small sample sizes, it is impossible to extrapolate out. Taking an extreme example, let's say you flip a coin once, and it lands heads. Because of this, you say that coins will always land on heads. This is a ridiculous claim, but that's what the 'study' showed. And when you have more complicated system, such as interactions between players in a video game, there is so much more you need to take into account."
KotakuInAction,3e3rbn,Din182,2,Wed Jul 22 05:26:55 2015 UTC,"I'm not a statistics wiz by any means, but the fact that there is a 13% difference between Male and Female voice winrate is a pretty big deviation. Also the fact that out of 4 possible outcomes (male/female voice with a w/l), one of those 4 possibilities only occured about 10% of the time.  Not sure how Halo's matchmaking works though, so I can't speak to how strange win rates ~70% are in the game.  Like I said, I don't think their information is all garbage, but they literally didn't account for the main objective (winning) in an objective based game."

Saying that the position of women has to improve DOES NOT mean that the position of men therefor has to be undermined. It does not mean that there's an effort to improve the position of women above the position of men. It does not mean the position of men is not important. But men are generally in a better position than women in many places, and if you want to affect permanent change you have to do it with the support of the gender 'in charge'.

At the same time, some trans folks see drag as parodying and ridiculing their gender identity and get incredibly defensive about it without taking into account that drag has a very long and prodigious history that pre-dates the relatively modern concept of being transgender, but not conventionally gay i.e. MtF trans folk who are attracted to women.  I've had serious disagreements with gay guys who refuse to believe that transgender women are anything other than gay men with a mental illness.

Doesn't that sound familiar?   Homosexuals in the DPRK have never been subject to repression, as in many capitalist regimes around the world. However, North Koreans also place a lot of emphasis on social harmony and morals. Therefore, the DPRK rejects many characteristics of the popular gay culture in the West, which many perceive to embrace consumerism, classism and promiscuity.   Gee, I wonder what life would be like if this lot got a thread of power."

So everybody needs to uphold your moral standards and judgement, and when they don't, they deserve to be doxx'd by parasites like Adrien Chen!  And it definitely wasn't Adrien Chen who got access to the guys information by tricking him with an ""interview request,"" and then had the reach from belonging to a huge ""news"" site so that millions of people got his entire identity and were able to threaten his life and harass him. It's all his fault, and Adrien Chen is the grand beacon of morality and delivered upon him his inevitable fate. That's why Gawker fired him, because they realized he was above their moral standards so much so that they could not have him making their look more reputable. Why, I'm sure every news site in the world is clammering for even a second of the grand beacon of morality, Adrien Chen's, childlike ramblings journalistic pieces!"

You bolded the word ""deserve"" which I never said.

And that example isn't even evident of what we're talking about, in the case that this person did nothing illegal and did nothing that caused harm to anyone, he simply moderated a forum that was doing something you (and I) don't agree with.  And making the statement that someone can't complain that someone else was doxx'd because they shared photos you don't find moral, that is making the argument that they deserved to be doxx'd because -insert reason-."

The underage bit, the ""income"" from moderating a subreddit, are both bullshit. Regardless, for arguments sake, let's say the guy was sharing naked photos of minors (which there's no evidence he was), you don't doxx him and share his information with everyone to create a vigilante mob who will threaten and harass him, you notify the police and have the police investigate him.  He basically made the same argument that people make for saying rape victims ""asked for it"" by dressing suggestively or drinking excessively. A completely reprehensible and disingenuous position. Adrien Chen doxx'd someone with a disabled wife who ended up being sent quite credible death threats and harassed endlessly. Adrien Chen is a vile parasite, period.

KotakuInAction,3e3w59,HandofBane,10,Tue Jul 21 19:32:18 2015 UTC,checks link   Financial Crimes Enforcement Network   OH BABY! My favorite kind of crime! People sometimes get sentenced to 100 years in prison or more for financial crimes!  But back on topic: Why did you email them about Patreon? What did you say? What are you hoping to get out of it? Do you have grievances with specific beneficiaries of Patreon? We're missing a lot of context here.  Would also like to see proof of emails with the relevant dox stuff blacked out.
KotakuInAction,3e3w59,SomeThrowAwayForKiA,7,Tue Jul 21 19:43:55 2015 UTC,"I have nothing to get out of this, I just fired off an email back in May about it and received a call from someone there a day later and sent a follow up email yesterday.  I added a screenshot of the email I received today."
KotakuInAction,3e3w59,endomorphosis,24,Tue Jul 21 19:49:26 2015 UTC,"This is excellent work my friend, government regulations are the most effective means of holding them accountable, to make sure that people aren't being conned or there's no laundering going on.  I wonder if this will effect randi harper https://www.patreon.com/freebsdgirl?ty=h, being that she has liens from the government against her that could be garnished, and that her blockbot is being used by ISIS."
KotakuInAction,3e3w59,FuckAllRedditCEOs,5,Tue Jul 21 19:51:48 2015 UTC,"I'm actually very surprised Patreon isn't. I must have flown under the radar, or see very little activity. If there's something governments don't like, it's secrecy in financial transactions."

KotakuInAction,3e3w59,AlseidesDD,13,Tue Jul 21 21:55:14 2015 UTC,"On one hand, Patreon is starting to work like PayPal but instead of business accounts it's an income facilitator and that will require compliance with all kinds of financial regulations (chief issue is to prevent money laundering).  On the other hand, there are a lot of amazing creators who use patreon and some of them get barely minimum wage for their work. If shit happens to Patreon that fucks with hardworking people who depend on regular donations to keep afloat, I would be disappointed."
KotakuInAction,3e3w59,melanchthon_,16,Tue Jul 21 19:53:00 2015 UTC,"It's simple, if you want to be a money processor in the US you have to register with FinCEN and report things to the government to prevent money laundering.  So right now Patreon may or may not be operating illegally, but that is up to FinCEN to decide."
KotakuInAction,3e3w59,BigTimStrange,3,Tue Jul 21 20:14:39 2015 UTC,"hardworking people    Like hotwheels? I'm sorry, I know I'm being facetious, but there's something to be said for the rules of the game we find ourselves in sucking, but them still being rules. (Which we didn't come up with too.)"

If Patreon isn't keeping their house in order, it would have bit them and the creators that use the service in the ass eventually."

KotakuInAction,3e579v,Danielle_S,5,Wed Jul 22 02:28:59 2015 UTC,Was trying to think of why his name sounded familiar. He was the person who doxed violentacrez from reddit. He also tried to purchase internetaristocrats dox.

KotakuInAction,3e579v,urection,3,Wed Jul 22 02:04:17 2015 UTC,there's no rhyme or reason to it; I regularly see antigamer nobodies with a couple favs/RTs right up there in the top results with tweets from GG supporters that have hundreds of RTs from thousands of followers
KotakuInAction,3e579v,ClitInstantWood,3,Wed Jul 22 02:18:30 2015 UTC,That's technically an attempt of vote manipulation. Shadowbanned account when?
