No seriously, that MacBook Pro's scores are about half of what the base 2014 model Air (scroll down to the first tech specs section). Core 2 Duo's are crap compared to the i-series.  Any graphics work will run better on a 2014 Air than it would the Core2Duo.  Then there's the RAM, it's a lot slower too. 1066 MHz compared to 1600 MHz in the Air.  Finally, the storage in the MacBook Pro is is an old (probably dying) hard disk drive whereas the Air has a super fast PCIe SSD flash drive.  As for your link to ""not buy"" a MacBook Pro... umm, that's the old MacBook Pro that no one should be buying and Apple should have killed off years ago. What you want is a MacBook Pro with Retina Display or a MacBook Air.

If so then you probably have damaged the volume and it is not mourning anymore. Open your applications folder and open the utilities folder in there and open Disk Utility.

If you bought them both from the same Apple Store, I'd just bring them both back in, show them what has been going on, and let them diagnose the problem.

There are three steps to a ""drag and drop"", click, drag, release. Which of the three problems is it?  Click: You can't click on anything on the desktop? Restart. Or try logging in as another user, and see if the problem happens there. If it does: Hardware. If not, your main user account has a software problem.  Drag: You can click a file, but can't ""drag"" it anywhere. This would probably be a mouse problem. Can you select text in a document? If you can, then my guess is something is activating your mouse button (or deactivating it), and causing the drag operation to fail. Possible hardware problem.  Drop: You can click a file, drag it, but can't release it. Mouse problem. The ""unclick"" isn't happening, so the mouse button is probably broken.  Crap. Too lazy to change every occurrence of ""mouse"" to ""track pad"". Sorry.  Also check your System Preferences: Trackpad options. Make sure there isn't anything ""unusual"" turned on in there, or in the Accessibility preference.
