YouShouldKnow,3e3jct,tptguy83,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:49:22 2015 UTC,The connection to their upstream carrier is probably very restricted on either bandwidth or data so they pass that on to the consumer.

What you're experiencing is the fact that you do not have a dedicated fiber line from your house to your isp. You share a connection with your neighbors. It's very expensive to have a dedicated line to your home and most providers wouldn't even sell you one. (thousands of USD per month for a dedicated gigabit line)
YouShouldKnow,3e3jct,Gankstar,2,Tue Jul 21 19:34:01 2015 UTC,Hate to admit this but fios had higher latency times for all games i played than comcast when i lived in an area that had both.  I mean like 30ms vs 90ms
YouShouldKnow,3e3jct,kenmacd,2,Tue Jul 21 19:14:55 2015 UTC,Not really useful. The distance that your signal is travelling to the ISP is tiny. You will notice no appreciable difference between copper and fiber.  You can have a high latency fiber connection or a low latency ethernet connection (although I'm guessing you're actually talking about cable or dsl).
YouShouldKnow,3e3jct,Patriarchal_Wiener,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:15:52 2015 UTC,"Hey, I'm a cable guy.  Well.  Internet and phone guy.  Our fiber optic services range from about 50 meg to 1 gig.

Plus, an fttn circuit running at 50/5 with 10ms ping will run Netflix the exact same as a gigabit circuit. Same goes for gaming, though a true fttp circuit will probably net a lower ping than copper or fttn(marginally anyway). If you can notice a difference between 2ms and 10ms ping in game you are a fucking wizard."

YouShouldKnow,3e3jct,Brownigan,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:41:17 2015 UTC,"My local cable company kinda pisses me off with their generous definitions of fiber.  They have a great cable plant in town, they have 8x4 bonding, speeds that are pretty decent for the price (I pay $75 for 100/5 but they're letting me test out a 200/10 plan for the same price right now in return for giving them speedtests now and then) but they still have to throw buzzwords around to confuse people.    On their website, they say ""Speeds up to 150mbps"" ""Powered by Fiber Optics!!!11"".  Okay, I guess technically that's true, the fiber goes to the CMTS, maybe as far as my cable node? (Not sure, I'm not a DOCSIS expert) but come on, their access network is mostly powered by RF/Coax.  Until they run the fiber right to my pedestal, I think it's disingenuous to throw the term fiber optics around in that context."

YouShouldKnow,3dy3k3,KeisariFLANAGAN,2,Tue Jul 21 04:46:55 2015 UTC,"I worked there as a part-time cashier one summer and they paid me a dollar better than minimum wage, which is way more than I was expecting. My fiancé has worked there for 4 or 5 years now and started at over $10/hr on 3rd shift and is now at over $13/hr. The pay really isn't as bad as everyone makes it out to be, at least in my personal experience.   Unless you're going to try to move up the management chain, you can't really make a living in any retail job. I have no idea how or why people try to make a living working in McDonald's or Walmart. Those kinds of jobs are obviously not going to cut it and should only be places to build experience for something with better pay and benefits, or for a part-time summer job for teenagers.   The workers at these places become complacent with the low wages, and management realizes that a lot of them are too comfortable or uninterested to move to a better job and will continue to pay them as little as possible because that's how business works. If these people would try to move up and out of these lower positions, Wal-Mart would be forced to pay competitive wages to keep them on board, or to just go to hiring teenagers and people looking for part-time work without a lot of pay.   So what I'm saying here is that the employees' stagnation is really hurting themselves. Wal-Mart is doing the capitalist thing, and I'm enjoying the low prices it brings to me. And again, I'm saying this as a former employee and fiancé to a current employee."

I now use ""daylighters"" in my office, which are florescent bulbs that simulate natural sunlight.  When I first acquired my office, it had standard florescent bulbs.  I no longer have any issues staying awake at work."

The way I found out about it was I put on a pair of yellow gun shooting glasses once and I felt more relaxed so I started researching why. I've never used those irlen glasses or taken their test, but I do use a pair of cheap yellow tint glasses if I'm in a situation that has fluorescents and I need to concentrate."

My eye muscles get tired from the strain and ache just like any other muscle. Overhead fluorescent lighting causes the most strain. I have reading glasses to help with this. If someone with perfect vision put them on they would think they're faux glasses; that's how minor my prescription is. If I read a lot under heavy overhead lighting I get really bad headaches and I can't open my eyes if there is any light. The cure, especially during standardized testing as a kid, rub my hands together like Danielsan until palms are warm and apply to eyes, if there is a faucet with warm water, use cloth or paper towels to absorb hot water and apply over eyes. They are not migraines, but they will def leave me on my bed with pillows over my face until my muscles relax."

This occurs because of how the cerebellum copes with vestibular deficiency, and the slightest bit of overstimulation can cause a blip in the corrective process, generally known as cerebellar compensation. It is indeed very uncomfortable, and while I don't suffer even close to the same level of symptoms I did prior to my first surgery, I'm still not immune to the phenomenon, as the surgery intentionally left with my a permanent vestibular loss in my left ear.  In other words, if you're curious as to how something completely unrelated to the ear can make someone dizzy, that's how. The trigger doesn't actually make the person dizzy, but it takes an already heavily taxed brain and diverts its attention away from trying to stay balanced and focused."

YouShouldKnow,3du5h9,ckfighter2,22,Sun Jul 19 14:29:03 2015 UTC,"These are some good points. I have been coaching kids in jiu-jitsu for a couple years and here are some things I've learned: * Managing parents' expectations.  Every parent wants their kid to succeed, esp right away. It takes hard work and time to be good at anything. Patience! * Parents must not even try to give advice to their kid in this sport. Our academy does not allow parents to coach during practice. It doesn't matter how many MMA shows you've watched, we are coaching, not you. Don't undermine our instructions. * Having fun!  Make sure the kids are having fun is vitally important. Drills can be boring at times, but overall, if they aren't interested in getting better, they won't try at all, and coaching will be futile. * Positive reinforcement is definitely the best approach.  Physical punishments (running laps, burpees, pushups) are completely ineffective. For some reason, kids will do 200 burpees like it's nothing. What can work, however, are timeouts.  Booting a kid from practice has shown to be surprisingly effective in getting them to shape up."

Discipline and negative criticism should be used to correct laziness and carelessness, not mistakes or failures. If your players are too afraid of making mistakes, they won't bother taking risks to make good plays. Even if they take a risk and fail, compliment them on their effort (unless it was a careless mistake).  Players work much harder when they compete for something and are having fun. Punishment for losing should be mild, but make the players really want to work hard and win. If you are too threatening, players will becoming demotivated, accept their punishment and just try to get the drill over with and move on.  Don't become your players' enemy. Motivate them, give them confidence, instruct them one-on-one. Make sure they understand the system and are clear on what to do. Let it be clear that you want to help them succeed, not feed off of their failure.  Yelling and anger don't give any positive results. Conditioning (or the possibility of conditioning) is probably the best motivator to get players to focus up and not mess around. In my experience, the quiet coaches are the ones I was most afraid."

YouShouldKnow,3du5h9,thekev506,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:04:30 2015 UTC,"Third year youth baseball coach and division coordinator. I coached tball for 2 years and machine-pitch for 1. And here's what I've learned about coaching kids:   pick up to five fundamentals to focus on each season. For me this season these were: throwing, catch, fielding ground balls, making the play at first, and identifying where the play is beyond first. start with basic drills that you can build on. Coaching kids is like building with blocks, you have to lay the base before you can build upwards or your tower will fall. Each week you add another component to the drill. Soft toss from the knee begins five feet apart and does not use gloves. As they learn the proper form, they earn distance and use of gloves. Then they earn standing. Each part of the drill is earned by successful completion of the last step. running is key. If they lose their focus, they run to the fence and back. If they disease the other kids or cause problems, they run to the fence and back.every practice begins with a run, if I beat them jogging, they run again. Every practice ends with a run. My team runs a lot... a whole lot. But they're damn quick on the bases by the end of the season. learn their limits. You'll notice when your team reaches the end of their abilities. Taking the next step is just something most of them are not physically capable of doing. Don't force them beyond this or they'll get frustrated with the lack of success. But continue to toe that line. Work up to it and continue to work on the fundamentals up to that level. team spirit. I'm not saying turn them into cheerleaders, but cheering on their teammates goes a long way to building everyone's confidence. Lots of relays and team drills. lastly, best start of the season drill for little kids: hot potato with names. Have kids stand in a circle, the ball must stay in motion, kids must call the name of the kid they're passing the ball to before the pass it. No passing to the same kid twice on a row. It helps them learn the names of their teammates and helps you learn their names."
YouShouldKnow,3du5h9,BobThePillager,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:51:20 2015 UTC,"Former camp counsellor, teaching assistant, ESL teacher, youth worker here.  Here are some general tips to add onto what's already been said:  1 - Put up a unified front.  Always back up your coworkers in front of the kids/their parents - you can always discuss something you didn't agree with later on, in private.  2 - Strictness (within reason) pays off.  When starting with a new group it's always better to be a little too strict than a little too lenient.  Those initial few sessions are your chance to set your standards and expectations; you can always ease up once you get to know them.  Think back to your time in school and a teacher with a badly behaving class or a really well behaved class - it's much much harder to get stricter once those standards have bedded in, but it's really easy to relax things a little when the class proves itself.  3 - Encourage peer teaching.  Got a kid that's way above average in something?  Encourage them to help out in teaching it to the other kids rather than showing off.  That leads me to...  4 - Ownership.  Let them have a say in things - picking the kinds of training and games they play would be a good example.  A lot of the time you'll find they come up with the same suggestions you would have done, but because they feel empowered from having a say they're much more willing to engage with the activity at hand."

The cost savings between Viagra and Revatio are minimal at best, and most certainly not enough to warrant writing off label.   We live in an unfortunately litigious society where lawyers don't even need to pop a Viagra to get a huge hard-on for suing a doctor. It's sad but true. This is why malpractice insurance is so expensive."

It's an actual, recognized learning disorder in the same vein as dyslexia, it's just much less known and I think it's important for people to hear about it. For those who suffer from it without knowing what it is, it helps to make them feel less alone and puts words and research to something they struggle with. For those who don't personally have it, it can help to reduce their propensity to judge others who may have it.   edit for your edit: Since no one was ever saying that just ""being bad at fractions"" meant you had a disorder, most people are going to assume you meant to insinuate dyscalculia either isn't real or is blown out of proportion.

It is illegal to sell a product with this type of date code beyond the date listed in Australia, it is also illegal to modify these date codes (any date codes, actually).  ""Best Before"" is for pretty much everything else, and is generally a manufacturer listed date of when the manufacturer considers the product to still be the same quality as when it was made.  It is legal to sell this stuff beyond the date listed, but most major retailers won't, except a few discount places.  There is also a push for retailers that would throw these date code products out to start donating to various welfare charity groups to feed the poor and homeless.

Packaged foods have to have some kind of kill step that controls dangerous bacteria but also usually kills spoilage causing bacteria too.  Acidic foods, like salsa, will keep for a long while in the fridge. They will probably go mouldy first since moulds can be difficult to kill completely and usually grow under a very wide range of conditions. Most harmful bacteria won't grow (or grow very slowly) in the refrigerator and many won't grow below pH 4.6 (pickles, salsa, and tomato products are often well below this). Salt also helps a lot to delay spoilage. You can also dramatically increase the shelf life of your foods by keeping them in the refrigerator. If you want a spoon of salsa, just spoon some out, then immediately return it to the fridge instead of leaving it on the table allowing it to warm. This is especially important for milk and dairy products."

I would say that in speech using it is useful and acceptable under the circumstances described, a sort of default, as the pronunciation difference makes it obvious. but for writing staying with the traditional defaults is probably wiser, at least in formal writing.  interestingly, here in the south using miz as a generic honorific is a long standing bit of dialect. further, using miss and the person's first name is a middle ground between friendly conversation and formal. you'll hear it at social gatherings where the majority aren't family, nor quite friends, but are more than acquaintances."

YouShouldKnow,3di5dc,Duke_of_Pillows,25,Thu Jul 16 16:37:23 2015 UTC,"What you are doing with this technique is relaxing the muscles in your body. This is required in order to fall asleep as the paralysis that your body undergoes while asleep can only be started if your body is calm.  Another great tip; try not to move. Like, at all. For very long periods. Make sure you are fully comfy. The motions that are 'allowed' while falling asleep are breathing and swallowing, as these (concious) movements also persist during sleep.  The last tip that aplies for some, but not all: when you are laying in bed, fully still, you might experience increasing amounts of itches. This is because your body uses this to check whether or not you are tired and sleepy enough to fall asleep. If you were to respond and thus scratch, your brain knows youre still too awake to fall asleep. Here's the trick: just ignore the itches. This way you can trick your brain into thinking youre more sleepy than you really are, allowing yourself to fall asleep earlier than normal.  I hope I am the only poor soul who has this, but you might also experience sudden pain signals instead of itches. They are there for the same reason.  Both the itches and the pain, when succesfully ignored (as in you havent moved at all since) should go away within minutes. Then you should start slowly drifting away towards sleep. A trick I use to safely enter this phase is by distracting myself by thinking as if you were talking to yourself, but in your head. Dont get too crazy with this however, as heavy emotions (may it be happy or sad) wake you up entirely.  Using this technique I fall asleep within 2 minutes if everything works out, as usually I wouldnt fall asleep at all.  Edit; typo Edit; grammar. Not my best day as far as english goes. Edit; Lastly, I forgot to mention that it can take up to weeks to learn this technique. (though for some it might not) Laying still is harder than it sounds, and more conciously falling asleep can sometimes be experienced as scary. Just take it slow. Go as far as you are comfortable and remember that nothing harmful can happen. Personally I had a lot of difficulty with laying still and keeping my eyes closed during the itches but since I have ADD (Attention Defecit Disorder) distracting my mind for me was easy as pie. My advice would just to experience it and to experiment and to thusly figure out your own way to achieve falling asleep with this method."

YouShouldKnow,3di5dc,Scarfall,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:23:36 2015 UTC,"Isolated sleep paralysis (or ISP) only happens if you happen to be going for lucid dreaming. Lucid dreaming requires you to stay awake mentally troughout the buildup of the dream and the dream itself, that being faaar longer than you will be during the technique I explained. ISP is caused by your mind failing to fall asleep when your body has fallen asleep. Your eyes are asleep as well, hence the hallucinations. Like I said, keeping yourself distracted once the itches have faded will keep you from this 99.9% of the time.  Just keep your eyes closed. If you want to open them anyway, move your entire body first before opening your eyes. This way you ensure not causing ISP as you have already moved your body, releasing it from paralysis that may have formed.  That said, you did make me realise I forgot to mention something. Try to avoid this technique if you are new to it and happened to be stressed. (From other sources such as a bad day or a upcoming deadline or  anything of the sort) as it can cause you to stay awake longer than supposed due to the heavy emotion, in the form of stress, that would you be experiencing.  Other than that, its completely safe if you do it step by step and make sure you dont stay too awake. I have only once experienced ISP due to going for lucid dreaming and messing up.  It is safe. If it were not, I would not have put in all this effort to explain this technique. Seriously, ISP is not a joke.  Edit: illusinations."

YouShouldKnow,3di5dc,melance,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:14:15 2015 UTC,"I suspect the breath holding is the important part, because it builds up carbon dioxide in the lungs. The carbon dioxide has a soporific effect. The exhalation clears the CO2 out, and then you breathe in, hold your breath to build up the carbon dioxide again. So with each cycle, you are getting more and more of the sleep-inducing effect. (Of course, too much CO2 at any one time will make you feel like you're suffocating and the gasping reflex will kick in.)  Tried this for the first time last night. Seemed to work! Best part: woke up in the middle of the night, usually a sign that I'll be up for 1-3 hours before feeling sleepy and being able to fall asleep again. Used the technique again and pretty quickly fell back into sleep until morning.   It was hard doing the 4-7-8 count, but I think as long as there is breath holding along the approximate intervals, the technique will work. So take a slow deep breath at your natural rate, then hold the breath for twice as long as it took you to take that intake. Make a slow exhale also at twice the time of the intake."

There are several articles on this topic, and the way the Kindle Paperwhite (or Kindle voyage, or Nook Glow) works is by shining a light on the screen that is then reflected back into your eyes. This is no different then reading a paper book with a dim light shining on the pages before bed. It's the backlit screens where the light is shining directly into your eyes that is a problem. Obviously, you should dim the screen of the paperwhite though when in a dark room."

As someone who's roommate has a therapy service animal, I can tell you that this works just fine.  If you have a prescription, present it to your leasing office.  They will copy it and put it in your file.  They are REQUIRED by law to allow you to have that service animal.  Not only that, but they are very limited in what they can legally ask you.  And this applies to any pet, not just dogs.  Birds, snakes, lizards, hamster, cat, doesn't matter.  The same thing applies to public transportation BTW, though there may be muzzling rules.  Interestingly, it does not apply to an individual renting out a personal home, only to businesses.   Note that I live in California.  Mileage in other states may vary.

There has been so much abuse of this that the government has begun providing clarification.  For example you are now able to make the determination that the person is actually disabled.  The guidelines from HUD specifically state that as the business owner you must consider ""Does the person seeking to use and live with the animal have a disability.""  In response to /u/epracer71's roommate who has ""mild anxiety"" the answer would be no on at least the federal level requirements.  Since they are in CA there can be state laws governing the situation but federally I doubt any reasonable person would say someone with ""mild anxiety"" is a disabled citizen.

Shit, piss, pet dandruff, and other allergens would be the next concern.   Either way, the correct nomenclature OP is looking for is Emotional Supportive Animal. You can research from on Google. One option is Skype dates with some therapists, other option is to see a local therapist.   I certified my dog with an Emotional Supportive Letter from my therapist saying she provides me daily emotional support and my landlord accepted it. Thankfully my landlord isn't a total cock.  Just throwing it out there, you can also pick up a ""Service Animal"" jacket off Amazon for <$40. Just please don't be an asshole about it in public places. You should at least be able to control your animal in a calm manner.   Thanks for letting me share.   Edit: Appreciate the downvotes, and thank you for the pitchforks! Been receiving very interesting PM's. Ive only done what OP had mentioned. All I can say is go fuck yourselves. You would all make excellent discriminating landlords.   Mocha helped me meet my now girlfriend at a party last halloween that I was about to not to attend due to my anxiety. Mocha gave me the confidence to say fuck it, and I haven't been happier since.   My sub lease agreement  was unexpectrdly terminated. Mocha was allowed to live at the house without certification. My coworkers baby brother was moving into a downtown apartment and asked if I would move in with him. Told him I had a dog, but he didn't mind either way.   I talked to the landlord upfront and told her what I intended to do with Mocha. She was more than happy to accommodate us based on the fact that I was honest, and Mocha obviously aids my mental health.  So I had 3 options if I wanted the opportunity  to live in this great apartment.    1) Abandon Mocha and live in a pet free apartment.   2) Be homeless for a minute and search for a pet friendly apartment and pay ridiculous fees.   3) Certify Mocha as an Emotional Service Animal through my therapist who has diagnosed me with depression and anxiety.  I do not regret my decision to stay by my best  friend, and I certainly will pass along the information if it will help somebody."

In most cases, a therapy animal is an essential facet of that person's course of treatment.  I do suffer from anxiety and panic attacks.  I don't have a therapy animal.  If I did, being forced to not have him with me would cause a major panic attack while at 35,000 feet in the air (already a stressful experience) while being trapped in a big box that recycles the same air.  Panic attacks basically feel like you're dying.

That's why I specified ""objectively"" and made sure to acknowledge that the therapy animals are definitely needed.  I get that a panic attack can feel like you are dying, but feeling like you are dying and actually dying from anaphylactic shock still deserves a distinction.  Someone with an allergy serious enough to kill them should probably have an epi-pen with them, but it's not some sort of cure all, it's a last resort. That plane would still be making an emergency landing with paramedics waiting on the tarmac.

YouShouldKnow,3dfzmu,MisterTruth,2,Thu Jul 16 15:15:05 2015 UTC,"I'm not trying to put you down or anything but that's kind of a poor analogy.   Peanut butter allergic people can be catered to by maintaining a special allergy standard prep area and tools. With some preparation and planning, cross contamination can be prevented virtually 100% of the time as long as everyone is careful. Since the school is responsible for the care of the students as well as their feeding, it is on the school to properly provide for those with extra needs.   The problem with animals on an airplane is that there is no plausible plan or process to protect people who do have insane allergies. Everyone shares the same environment and unless companies start cranking out locally partitioned airplanes, it's going to be an issue.   I guess we could say it's on the airline to make sure they don't match up deathly allergic people with pet carrying people during reservation times. Then it would just be a matter of designating animal/no animal flights and/or first come first serve.   But since it isn't that way right now, we have to kind of put the onus on the people with the animals since they're changing the status quo.   People with allergies have, until now, have had reasonable expectations to not see any animals on airplanes. Animals have been banned on flights for a long long time and it's only changing recently, and only in some places, in certain cases, where animals are being allowed on.   The ideal, again, is to have the airline take care of it with a new system in place so that animal/allergy people never end up on the same flight in the first place while still giving both accessibility to light options."

It just never happened in my immediate family. I love dogs.  When I finally got my first dog I was amazed at how much it increased social interaction. People would just stop you on the street and compliment the dog. For someone with social anxiety it might sound daunting but the focus was always on the dog so you could kind of be peripherally sociable without being overwhelmed and you can always just focus on the dog and ignore the rest of society if you needed to.  I love talking to strangers and don't have any social anxiety but I totally get how a dog could be therapeutic for someone that did.

YouShouldKnow,3dfzmu,KitRook,3,Thu Jul 16 12:52:35 2015 UTC,"There are actually limitations in the FHA on what kind of dwellings qualify as required to allow you to live there with an ESA. It basically only applies to places like a large apartment complex or a single-family home that is being rented out by a realtor or broker and not the owner. And it's for no other reason than to prevent discrimination based on a disability.  Are there people that abuse the system? Absolutely. When I was researching the process for myself I couldn't believe how simple they make it. Nothing more than a letter from your doctor that states you have a disability and the animal assists you with one basic function and you're set. A lot of websites out there even provide a link to an online office where you can speak to someone who will determine if you have an illness and then write the letter for you. They charge out the ass for it, too.  It's a shitty situation because there are people that genuinely benefit from an ESA, but at the same time it's hard to find trainers who specialize in training ""true"" service animals in the field of psychiatric health. Ultimately, any landlord is going to get their pet deposit and cleaning fee from me anyway, because I have cats.

YouShouldKnow,3dfzmu,winkers,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:47:58 2015 UTC,"Just an FYI for everyone (from servicedogcentral.org:   According to the U.S. Department of Justice, ""The term service animal includes individually trained animals that do work or perform tasks for the benefit of individuals with disabilities, including psychiatric, cognitive, and mental disabilities."" However, ""[a]nimals whose sole function is to provide emotional support, comfort, therapy, companionship, therapeutic benefits, or to promote emotional well-being are not service animals.""  What's the difference between ""work"" and ""tasks"" in the ADA definition of ""service animal""?  There is overlap between the two terms. Legally it is not relevant which the service dog does, so long as he does one or the other or some of both. A service dog's legitimacy is not determined based on whether he does one or the other or both. It's a little puzzling why we get so many requests for an explanation of the differences between the two when the differences aren't what matters.  First, what they have in common: 1. must be individually trained (not natural behaviors of dogs such as needing to be walked or turning their head when they hear a sound, emotional support, or companionship) 2. must mitigate the person's disability (ie be something the person's disability prevents or substantially limits them from being able to do for themselves)  A task is an individual, discrete (a complete stand alone unit), specific thing that needs doing. It has one cue and one result. It might be a simple behavior or a complex one with multiple steps, but there is always a single objective. Examples of tasks include: opening doors, picking up dropped items, and notifying the handler of the sound of the doorbell.  Work is a broader term that may include any of the following: 1. a group of related tasks (such as hearing work consisting of signalling for several different individual sounds with a different response for each sound) 2. a trained behavior that has a decision tree where the outcome is not always the same but requires the dog to evaluate different options and choose the correct one (such as guiding around obstacles)  Do I qualify for a service dog?  Can you train your own dog to be a service dog?  In the U.S., yes, but in most other countries, no. Regardless of who trains the dog he must be correctly trained. Few pet owners would have the level of skill required to produce a true working dog."

I've never had it not work and I've shown tons of people. There was a medical explanation as to why it worked, which I've forgotten, but I've never been stuck with the hiccups since I learned the technique.   I've heard of and tried other methods, but always ended up with hiccups that I couldn't relieve. I don't care if it's magic or juju or what, the method I described fixes it 100% of the time, and no one I know has ever had it fail.

I think it's because of pressure on the diaphragm muscle.  I've read that doctors think hiccups are due to irritations of this muscle so it makes sense.  I'm telling you...  This always works.

The neti pot causes water to hit your olfactory epithelium pretty much every time (what it's supposed to do). This also happens to be the same area the amoeba needs to land in order for it chew through the olfactory nerve, which it is attracted to, to get to your brain.  Also, while the irrigation helps remove the bad mucus, it may also dilute or wash away beneficial antibacterial, antifungal, and antiviral agents in the good mucus, which provides an easier access point for the amoeba. So the risk becomes two-fold."

Mam went on for ages about him using words like that on telly and showing himself up and making it look like we all had no manners and people from down south would be looking down on us. Don't know why I remember that so strongly, it's quite odd.   We're  from the collieries and the word wasn't used that much, but it was used. The Charltons were from Morpeth I think, somewhere around Ashington which was a fair bit further north than us, and as you must know, the accent changes and gets stronger with every village you pass through.

Below I will show you how to use adwcleaner to remove unwanted junkware, adware, and browser related garbage. Adwcleaner is great for clearing simple junkware and adware. It may not always remove all viruses, junkware, or adware, but it seems to get most of it. If you have a serious infection which is not resolved by adwcleaner, please post a new topic here: Infected? Get Help With Viruses and Pop Ups.  NOTE: adwcleaner will ask you to reboot your computer when it is finished, I recommend you save all of your open files and then close everything prior to running adwcleaner.  To use adwcleaner, first download and then run (adwcleaner download). I recommend you get the new version every time you use this software by using the download link above. If you saved the file and need to run it, locate the adwcleaner.exe then double click on the the adwcleaner.exe icon:  adwclean_zpsoddqirv0.jpg  Click yes to continue to open the cleaner.  When adwcleaner opens, you will get a new window, click the ""Scan"" button to start scanning for junk (red arrow).  adwscan_zpss1uth1qa.jpg  When the scan is complete, you will be able to look through what it has found by clicking each tab (red Arrows). Here you can verify that everything you want removed is checked. Anything you do not want removed, uncheck the boxes next to the item. When you are done looking at the objects from the scan go ahead and click the ""Cleaning"" button (green Arrow).  adwscan2_zpsxaob4dzt.jpg  After clicking the ""Cleaning"" button, you may be prompted to click ok for a reboot. Go ahead and click ok and let the computer restart.  On the next boot you will see a notepad document open which is the report for what adwcleaner has done. You can read through this to verify that items were removed or you can ignore it and close it. The report is stored on the hard drive and can be brought up at a later point if needed.  Happy Computing."

Two cheap flights are often a lot cheaper than your original search. See example by HairyRunt  We analyze about 15-30 different airports in every search (within a certain distance). You might know Oakland is near San Francisco, but do you know the Oaklands of Berlin or Paris?  We split tickets and change airports (e.g. SFO-LON first flight, LON-OAK return flight) or multi destinations in split tickets (to take advantage of low cost carriers) many other features that make flight search a lot easier  What we want to do is have you search one time and see all possible combinations that otherwise would take a lot of time to find. If we don’t find a better combination of airports and flights, there probably isn’t any.  We are always working on our features (airport suggestions sometimes do not make sense for example) and love to hear your ideas what we should implement!"

YouShouldKnow,3d8yje,stls,5,Wed Jul 15 01:52:47 2015 UTC,I would say pretty effective. Asia has great low cost carriers and we help you in finding and combining the best connections. Often you can find connections you did not even know about because many leave from lesser known airports that are still easily reachable.

We find two cheap flights and combine the two to save you money. They are just that: Two normal flights and you can, for example, stay a day or two in a cool city and of course bring luggage (if you want and have enough time). Skiplagged on the other hand takes one flight and “splits” it: You leave the flight at a stopover. Cool feature, but the airlines don’t like it (can't say if it is legal, sorry) and you I think you cannot bring luggage"

Say you earn $2000 a month and you spend $500 on bills, $500 on food, $500 on entertainment and save $500.  Now you get a $500 raise. If you make a conscious effort to put most of that towards savings your expenses won't raise that much, let's say they'll be 500/bills, 550/food, 600/entertainment and 850/savings. This way you're living a little bit better so you actually experience the raise but most of it goes towards savings. And if your salary ever gets bumped down for any reason you'll not experience it so hard and still have a good bit of savings to fall back on.  On the other hand if you make no effort to put the raise towards your savings the money will disappear very quickly and you won't even feel the difference (the new, more expensive lifestyle quickly becomes a new normal for you). Suddenly you're buying better beer, eating out more often, sleeping in better hotels, driving a better car but none of this makes any real difference. Your savings don't raise with your income and at the same time if your salary ever goes down you'll experience it very painfully - it's easier to not eat at expensive restaurants and drive a cheaper car if you're not used to treating yourself to more expensive things on a regular basis."

The core of the book, though is actually pretty interesting: We could eliminate a lot of unnecessary things by clear more precise but ultimately less communication, thinking less in familiar work structures and granting more responsibility to people who usually don't have it (by the hypical boss).
