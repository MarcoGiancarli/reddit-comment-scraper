Boxer,3ddkii,justwanttolurk,3,Wed Jul 15 12:57:38 2015 UTC,"What might work is to let them play first.  Let them get it all out and wear each other down.  Then give them food separately.  By then, your dog may be super hungry from the energy used and want to eat right away.  Your dog may need to learn to eat when food is given, instead of having it available all day as well"
Boxer,3ddkii,envregs,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:32:15 2015 UTC,"Teach the one who eats everything in sight that it is not ok to eat the other dog's food.

Boxer,3ddkii,murm87,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:50:03 2015 UTC,Ask your brother if he's ok with you correcting his dog if she starts to eat the puppy's food.  Granted it's something that you would have to keep an eye/ear on.  Otherwise feed your puppy in a separate room in the morning and evening when you wake up and go to bed.

As he's aged; we've tried to be a little more careful with his diet.  He's tall and muscular. I imagine yours will gain 10 pounds or so.

Boxer,3d6md9,defragmeout,3,Tue Jul 14 01:33:30 2015 UTC,"We went through cardiomyopathy with our Dane. The medications did a lot to relieve some of his symptoms, so off hand, I'd say give it a shot. If you have another episode, or if you notice any other symptoms, it's time to reevaluate."
Boxer,3d6md9,Shadow1ane,2,Mon Jul 13 23:05:54 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry you had to go through that. I just edited my post, they did prescribe him enalapril, until we figure out our next step. Did you go for further testing or was your Dane on meds prescribed from the regular vet?"
Boxer,3d6md9,Shadow1ane,3,Mon Jul 13 23:15:57 2015 UTC,"Danes are prone to cardiomyopathy, so we knew what to look for and found it early (1.5 years old). He was on increasing doses of enalapril for the rest of his short life (he had A LOT of health problems), but it seemed to do the trick for him without need of additional testing with a cardiac specialist.  Honestly, I'd hold off on the testing and give the enalapril a couple of months unless he has another episode. I'd be concerned with them having to sedate him in his current condition."
Boxer,3d6md9,object_on_my_desk,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:24:04 2015 UTC,"Wow, you are wonderful! That's some really good insight.  I am afraid that with how severe his episode on Saturday was that if it happens again, we might not get so lucky. But the vet did say that if that happens, sometimes they can come out of it on their own. They did say that it sounded like I saved his life so I really don't know."

Boxer,3cqoe9,ElJefe10,0,Fri Jul 10 18:12:30 2015 UTC,As do I. I only found those studies to satiate the needs of the other redditors.
Boxer,3cqoe9,n2speed125,3,Fri Jul 10 22:50:25 2015 UTC,Don't post bs unless you have proof
Boxer,3cqoe9,ElJefe10,0,Fri Jul 10 17:34:49 2015 UTC,Here you go http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/dog-spies/do-spayed-and-neutered-dogs-get-cancer-more-often/. This article evaluates both studies in 2013 and 2014 which point to increased cancer in dogs that have been spayed/neutered.
Boxer,3cqoe9,n2speed125,0,Fri Jul 10 17:48:28 2015 UTC,"The Vizsla study involved 2,505 dogs, and reported these results:      Dogs neutered or spayed at any age were at significantly increased risk for developing mast cell cancer, lymphoma, all other cancers, all cancers combined, and fear of storms, compared with intact dogs.     Females spayed at 12 months or younger, and both genders neutered or spayed at over 12 months had significantly increased odds of developing hemangiosarcoma, compared with intact dogs.     Dogs of both genders neutered or spayed at 6 months or younger had significantly increased odds of developing a behavioral disorder, including separation anxiety, noise phobia, timidity, excitability, submissive urination, aggression, hyperactivity, and/or fear biting. When it came to thunderstorm phobia, all neutered or spayed Vizslas were at greater risk than intact Vizslas, regardless of age at neutering.     The younger the age at neutering, the earlier the age at diagnosis with mast cell cancer, cancers other than mast cell, hemangiosarcoma, lymphoma, all cancers combined, a behavioral disorder, or fear of storms.     Compared to intact dogs, neutered and spayed dogs had a 3.5 times higher risk of developing mast cell cancer, regardless of what age they were neutered.     Spayed females had nine times higher incidence of hemangiosarcoma compared to intact females, regardless of when spaying was performed, however, no difference in incidence of this type of cancer was found for neutered vs. intact males.     Neutered and spayed dogs had 4.3 times higher incidence of lymphoma (lymphosarcoma), regardless of age at time of neutering.     Neutered and spayed dogs had five times higher incidence of other types of cancer, regardless of age of neutering.     Spayed females had 6.5 times higher incidence of all cancers combined compared to intact females, and neutered males had 3.6 times higher incidence than intact males."

My dad stopped her and made her come back in the room and suffer through it with the rest of us.  The farts were roses compared to the smell of adrenaline she would emit when she heard or saw one of her triggers.  One was UPS trucks.  We were in my dad's truck going down the road and she saw a one and she got all riled up, and the scent she released was awful, and you could only roll down the windows so much because we were afraid she would smash it out to get at em.

We first found friends that would take a few puppies, and we found the best people we could to take good care of them since we will keep only two of them, but we are lucky enough to have boxer-lover friends too :)  One month from now, my house will be full of boxer puppies!

Toys with stuffing are commonly not a good option, as you'd be suprised at how much and how fast a boxer can unstuff just about anything.   Durable leash, and collar. Big chewers. Raw frozen bones are a great thing for dental hygine, and keeping the little ones busy. Would wait until he or she is around 10mo for the raw though.   Training. I always suggest starting early, as it strengthens the bond and time spent training.   Boxers jump, get used to it. Even the friendliest of the bunch do it."

It's still worth a try, but the point to the reply is, boxers somehow seem to break all assumed general rules. ;)   We're worried about the potty training more than anything. Some real horror stories floating about the Boxer and stomach issues.    If you find stomach issues, try a limited ingredient food.

My Forever Pet by Susanne Taylor  There's something missing in my home,  I feel it day and night,  I know it will take time and strength  before things feel quite right.

Boxer,3c98wq,BeerMang,5,Mon Jul 6 02:10:59 2015 UTC,"I highly recommend going through a local boxer rescue. Our local rescues test each dog for temperament and how well they do with other pets and children.  They typically do a great job of matching dogs to potential owners as they want each dog to find their forever home.  I think you'll find their individualized guidance very helpful.   Edit: Yes, this can absolutely be achieved with an older dog."
Boxer,3c98wq,MsTexas,3,Mon Jul 6 02:35:14 2015 UTC,"Absolutely. You'll want to do this because they'll know if the dog is right for you. A vast majority will be great with your children but it would still be nice to know for sure and it's a real crapshoot with cats. Our family has had a lot of boxers and none of them have ever been violent towards cats, but some have been obsessed with trying to play with them and chase them. Cats don't generally like that."
Boxer,3c98wq,burts_beads,3,Mon Jul 6 02:53:17 2015 UTC,Most dogs adapt to whatever is expected of them as long as you're loving and patient. It can be harder if the dog has extreme anxieties. It would also be good to pick a dog with history of small children and/or other animals. Best of luck!
Boxer,3c98wq,nuttynelly,3,Mon Jul 6 02:36:03 2015 UTC,"I foster for a local rescue, and I often get older boxers. They still have the boxer traits, but their recovery time is slower. As others have mentioned already, you'll want to go through a rescue. We learn quite a bit about the dog as we foster them.   Boxers can get a little stubborn, but the trick is giving them no leeway to the behaviors you do not want them to do, and they will understand that the new environment = new rules."
Boxer,3c98wq,PolarBill,1 point,Mon Jul 6 12:47:44 2015 UTC,"Thank you!  On a separate note, I'm interested in that last part about no leeway. Does this mean a loud ""No"" when they are doing the undesireable behaviors and a treat when they are doing the desirable behaviors?"
Boxer,3c98wq,PolarBill,1 point,Mon Jul 6 23:59:06 2015 UTC,"Definitely treat when they are doing the desirable behaviors, but it kinda depends on the undesirable behaviors. A ""No"" doesn't need to be loud, more so that you need to feel authoritative while saying it."
Boxer,3c98wq,kaylaabby09,1 point,Tue Jul 7 12:35:05 2015 UTC,I've had 4 boxers over the last couple years. 3 young and one old.. Boxers will be more rambunctious than most breeds but there are so many benefits to them that cancel that out. :) I did have an older boxer when I was in high school love me and my dad but HATED my mom. I'm not sure if that was because we didn't come into the picture until he was already 6.. But he never did anything but my mom couldn't even get onto my younger siblings without him looking lime he wanted to eat her. Lol I feel like a puppy would be safer. But this is solely based on my personal experience. And I think it depends on the family that had the dog first and their intentions also.

Boxer,3c35y9,AliceA,2,Sat Jul 4 17:10:16 2015 UTC,From my experience the more you work at it the more you just provide an interesting problem for them to solve! Is she under 3 years? They mature around that age and usually all this nonsense (most anyway) seems to get under control about then.  Maybe buy an old couch (or a free one) and put it out there and let her rip it up...had friends who had two young males and they just kept replacing old couches in their kennel until they matured.
Boxer,3c35y9,AliceA,1 point,Sat Jul 4 17:13:33 2015 UTC,This answer makes so much sense but it doesn't exactly solve my problem. It just gives me extra mess to clean up! But I agree with the maturity aspect based on past boxer dogs.
Boxer,3c35y9,Bthur,1 point,Sat Jul 4 17:20:14 2015 UTC,Well yes but it gives you a good laugh and memories too!
Boxer,3c35y9,PolarBill,2,Sat Jul 4 17:22:42 2015 UTC,I had a boxer who hated having a dog bed in his kennel and would tear up any that I put in there (age 7 when I finally figured everything out).  It finally got to a point that I swapped the bed out for a few blankets and that made him much happier.  He liked being able to move the blankets around to create the spot he wanted to lay in much more than having the bed define everything.
Boxer,3c1p10,Cgib512,5,Fri Jul 3 23:09:37 2015 UTC,Why?
Boxer,3c1p10,beerbreadcheesemetal,1 point,Sat Jul 4 04:14:41 2015 UTC,He was a rescue dog. They found him about a year ago in California as a stray. The vet's determined from the CT scan that this injury happened when he was a super young puppy. His Zygomatic arch (eye socket) was crushed and fell down fusing his skull to his bottom jaw. So whether it was abuse or just neglect he spent over three years of his life eating kibble whole (Couldn't chew) out of a small little hole that his tongue had created by pushing his teeth outwards.
Boxer,3c1p10,beerbreadcheesemetal,1 point,Sat Jul 4 15:31:47 2015 UTC,"Poor guy. I had a Beagle that was found in the woods with a broken leg. We expected him to be a quiet lap dog, but dogs always find a way to push through those injuries, don't they? I'm glad he's improving!"

Boxer,3bx9of,MechaTech,1 point,Thu Jul 2 22:25:15 2015 UTC,"Ever have one of those things that just falls into your lap?  Well, here's Bella, the Boxer.  She fell into my lap last night thanks to a facebook message and someone moving who couldn't take her with them.  She is the third dog in a row that I got for free (the first being a retired corgi, the second being a mutt with beagle and Australian shepherd in her) and we're really looking forward to seeing how things go with her.  She's integrated herself into the family fairly well, considering this is the second day we've had her, and the boys (I have 4 sons) are all arguing over who's bed she gets to sleep on.    Bella is six months old, so we're scheduling her for the earliest vet visit we can at our local vet to get on heartworm and flea medication, and when we can get the funds together, we'll get her spayed so hopefully we can avoid her going into heat.    Anything I need to watch out for?  Any advice you'd give a new boxer owner?"
Boxer,3bx9of,Grhylln,4,Thu Jul 2 22:29:31 2015 UTC,Is she mixed? Her face seem to be a tiny bit of something else imho. She's looks absolutely gorgeous. Boxers have the best personalities and are very smart. If you train her well she will be the best dog you will ever have and also be the best person to play and run around with. They have tons of energy but will destroy the yard if you don't play with them much. Enjoy!
Boxer,3bx9of,Grhylln,4,Fri Jul 3 01:02:38 2015 UTC,"Thank you!  From what we were told she is a purebred boxer, but there aren't any AKC papers to back that up, so we're just going with 'pseudo-boxer.'  Close enough for us!  She's already starting to wiggle her way into things - specifically our bed, right between my wife and I, just to cuddle.  We're giving her daily walks and lots of attention, and we're working on basic training now - sit, lay down, shake, stay - we're having a lot of fun with her. :)"

Boxer,3bw4jg,Dirtyrockstar,7,Thu Jul 2 17:12:29 2015 UTC,Why did you think it was a good idea to get a puppy when you're still dealing with a 7 month old child? Sounds like you made a rushed decision and didn't consider the negative aspects of your choice.
Boxer,3bw4jg,OccasionalAsshole,-1,Thu Jul 2 18:41:45 2015 UTC,As I said it was a litter my friend was having. They had puppies for sale and it seemed like from the research we had done that boxers were great family pets and good with small children. We have a good friend who had a boxer a couple years old when they had a newborn baby and the boxer was great with their child. So we didn't think it would be an issue. But this puppy seems like more work then the 7 month old and we are trying to fix the issues
Boxer,3bw4jg,somethingfabulouss,3,Thu Jul 2 18:51:09 2015 UTC,"Older boxers are fantastic family dogs. Our girl loved my cousin's baby and there were never any issues there. Your issue is not the breed at all, or your dog, but a new puppy that isn't trained isn't going to be calm. They're going to want to play and the baby is just another friend to an energetic puppy. The other commenters have made good points about getting chew toys to curb the chewing on arms/legs and what not but it is a puppy behavior to chew and play and there's a certain amount to be expected. It is a fixable issue, though, and with training and time it will subside.   In addition, look up resources on proper crate training.  The humane society website has an excellent tutorial on training your puppy to enjoy their crate and see it as a shelter rather than a punishment. We used this exact method training our boxer when she was a puppy and hardly had any issues with separation anxiety. It takes a lot of patience and you're not going to be able to just stick the dog in the crate for the night for quite some time, it has to be a gradual process.   Lastly, about the diarrhea, I'm obviously not a vet but our girl had the exact issue when she was a puppy, she never had solid poops and would play outside for forever then come inside and poop, and she was super skinny. When we took her to the vet, it turned out she had worms and serious stomach issues. We had her on a cottage cheese and anti-worm medicine diet for a while and from then on we've had to be careful about what food to buy, only higher quality ones (sadly more expensive) to make sure her stomach stays healthy. Anyways, you may want to take your puppy to the vet and make sure there's nothing wrong with him/her.   Overall, just know that since boxers are larger dogs and your dog is just a puppy, it's going to have a ton of energy all the time. Make sure it gets a lot of physical activity and be patient, after the puppy stage they are fantastic dogs with good training."
Boxer,3bw4jg,MaLeskee,2,Thu Jul 2 19:32:29 2015 UTC,Thank you. Yeah there has been some great info we've been getting from people. I thank you for your suggestions and will be trying them
Boxer,3bw4jg,beingabitch,3,Thu Jul 2 19:38:08 2015 UTC,"This just sounds like classic puppy to me. If you haven't had bigger dogs before, it can seem like a handful, trust me.   As far as the nipping and things go, that just sounds like teething. Invest in a few good chew toys; if you can fill them with peanut butter, thats better. Let her spend some time with those, but make sure to praise her when she directs her attention to those instead of your arms. That should give you some quiet for at least a little bit. I've also heard of putting really wet hand sanitizer on your hands and then letting her try to nip. It doesn't taste good, and she'll learn real quick that hands = off limits. If she persists too much, then you need to turn towards negative reinforcement. If you are against shock collars, I've heard of getting an airhorn, and whenever the dog gets into a situation like that, you can blow it and scare the dog so they know not to do that. Seems cruel, but if the safety of your family is at stake it might help.  In that same vein, throw the toys in her kennel for her to lick out. She'll work off some teething stress and also grow more comfortable in her crate with the door open. Start with only a few minutes at a time and stay right by her side so she knows you aren't going anywhere. Increase to 5 minutes, 10 minutes, with you removing yourself for more time each time you practice. Eventually she should be more accustomed to this.   Above all, not just exercise but mental stimulation is important. She can start learning simple commands like sit, stay, and lie down. Even just practicing for a a half hour each day helps. Leave it was a HUGE command for my boxer to master. With boxers, EVERYTHING can become a toy, so for him to learn leave it was crucial.   Honestly, I would invest in some introductory dog training classes. Find out who is good in your area and go. Even if its just for the socialization, so your pup can play with other puppies, burn off some energy, and get some obedience training in. Boxers are phenomenal dogs and are great with children. Just try to manage her as much as you can in this puppy stage and you won't regret it."
Boxer,3bw4jg,burts_beads,3,Thu Jul 2 18:19:41 2015 UTC,"When I was kennel training my pup, she would go crazy and cry at night when I left her in there so my boyfriend and I put her kennel in our room for a few weeks. It made her feel better and we knew when to let her out to go potty.   Then we moved her out to the living room and then to the play room where we wanted to originally keep her.   I don't have any children so I can't help you there. Sorry.   Edit: We have a cat and when we first introduced our puppy to him our puppy (Marina) would always try to go find him in the house and we just started to call her name and she would come back and we would reward her with pets or kisses or whatever. It was definitely a process. Fast forward 9 months and Marina is so well behaved. She is always in the room with us and she is perfect off-leash.  It doesn't really sound like you have the unlimited free time that I had to devote to training though. Good luck!"
Boxer,3bw4jg,burts_beads,2,Thu Jul 2 18:37:17 2015 UTC,"A lot of this is typical puppy stuff, just do you best to correct behavior. As for pooping inside, keep a close eye on her. All our puppies have always made it fairly obvious that they were looking for a place to poop (sniffing around, you can tell by the body language, etc.)   As for the nipping/biting, you have to correct this behavior. My guess is that even if you're correcting it, your young kids aren't and this is confusing her."
Boxer,3bw4jg,Jdubb750,-2,Thu Jul 2 18:20:24 2015 UTC,It's hard for a 7 month old who is rolling around or trying to crawl to be able to defend himself or make it seem like he doesn't want to play when his arms and legs are flailing widely and uncontrollably and the dog thinks it's a game to try catching his limbs
Boxer,3bu3yn,BishopMyriel,1 point,Thu Jul 2 04:08:47 2015 UTC,"There are a few possible causes of seizures in dogs. Most of them are not good. I would go to the vet as soon as you can and have bloodwork done. If she has another seizure, try to time it. Your vet will want to know how long they last. On the plus side, treatment can be possible. One of my cats has what the vet believes to be idiopathic epilepsy and it is nearly totally controlled by a small amount of phenobarbital twice a day."
Boxer,3bu3yn,defragmeout,1 point,Thu Jul 2 13:48:31 2015 UTC,"I had a Boxer that did something that sounds similar to this. He would just start shaking his head but he never lost consciousness and was alert throughout them. You should def. time how long they last the next time she has one. We took him to the vet and they gave him medicine that was about $50 a month, Phenobarbital, but the vet didn't really know what was causing them. He suggested more testing. We gave him the medicine for a couple months and they started becoming less frequent. That summer we stayed in a rural area and stopped giving him the med., the seizures stopped. When we came back home it started back up occasionally. I think it was from city living. When he did have them, if we held a treat in front of him and let him sniff it, it always stopped pretty quickly.  Let her get a good sniff before giving the treat. My boy liked peanut butter on spoon. Which was good b/c he'd spend a moment licking it."

Boxer,3bp28p,HalPaneo,3,Wed Jul 1 00:09:49 2015 UTC,"I have a dog that has been on phenobarbital for seizures for about a year now. I don't know what the vet told you, but when we started her on it, we were told it would take at least 4 weeks for the meds to build up effective levels in the blood, and would most likely take 6 weeks before she fully adjusted. We did what the vet said, and the first six weeks were very difficult. She could not control her bladder, was eating everything in sight and gaining weight and seemed quite high most the time. After the 7th week, most all the side affects went away. Her weight normalized and she stopped eating so much. Her bladder control became much better - she only has accidents about once a month now. She's only had three seizures in the last year. I do not think two weeks is enough time for the medicine to work or for the dog to adjust. During that first six weeks, we thought about adjusting the dose or giving up, but I am glad we did not. We did what the vet said and our dog is much better for it.   TLDR: Do what the vet says regardless of how it feels/looks - they know more about what they are doing than we do."
Boxer,3bp28p,tekstuph,2,Wed Jul 1 16:16:06 2015 UTC,"ETA: Don't change the dosage of any medication without checking with your vet first.    You could try lowering the dose of the phenobarb to see if that makes a difference in how loopy he appears. I found one instance where gabapentin and pred were used instead of phenobarb. Prednisone will reduce some of the swelling in the brain. The shitty reality is phenobarb and steroids are all you can do, aside from radiation that is probably not going to be that effective - especially at this stage. If I were you, I would try a lower dose of phenobarb and inquire about gabapentin/prednisone. I don't have first hand experience with gliomas in dogs, but from my experience with them in people, you are in the end stage now. Having said that, I would wait to euth until he stops playing and eating. <3 and cuddles to you and your boy"
Boxer,3bp28p,defragmeout,2,Wed Jul 1 13:39:49 2015 UTC,Do not lower the dose of phenobarb without the advice of your veterinarian. That is a stupidly bad idea. Inquire about leviteracitam (aka Kepra) Source: I am a veterinarian. You should never take internet advice as medical advice.
Boxer,3bp28p,cr250guy,1 point,Wed Jul 1 13:51:13 2015 UTC,Oh dear. Yes. All of what I am saying assumes that you are in constant contact with the vet. I should have made that more clear.
Boxer,3bp28p,defragmeout,2,Wed Jul 1 15:57:32 2015 UTC,"Same thing happened to one of my boxers.  It got so bad that the poor thing would walk in circles, walk into walls (when not having seizures), and going to the bathroom wherever she stood.  I had no choice but to have her put down.    Was the hardest thing I've ever had to do but watching her like this was even harder on me.  Do yourself and your boxer a favor, euthanize the poor thing so it doesn't have to suffer anymore."
Boxer,3bp28p,Poguemohoin,1 point,Wed Jul 1 12:25:31 2015 UTC,"First off, there is nothing wrong with asking for help and support, so ignore some of the rude comments. What you are going through is something all boxer owners dread. I think you should trust yourself and your boy to make the right decision. Take people's advice with a grain of salt because a lot of them are biased based on their personal experiences. To give you my biased advice though, all of our boxers have given us signs they were ready to go. If your boy isn't in pain or discomfort then let him live his life until he decides it's too much. My boy has seizures monthly to weekly and has cancer, but he is extremely happy otherwise. You said he was 11 years old so I am sure he has lived a wonderful life, you just need to decide if he is telling you he can't go on further. Keep a close eye on him and of course enjoy whatever time is left, but dont do anything prematurely because of what other people say.  Im truly sorry you have to go through this, it really is like losing a member of the family."
Boxer,3bp28p,dubois1919,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:25:27 2015 UTC,"Sorry.  Our last Boxer had a brain tumor. Inoperable. He did not get any seizures until the very end, and even then it was just shaking, almost like constant shivers. I'm surprised the Dr did not order a MRI to find out instead of saying ""It is most likely a brain tumor."" They are really expensive though, so that my play into it.  Look, you are going to have to put him down. Maybe not today, but soon. Make you peace with that reality. Do it now. You can give him the drugs, or like somebody else suggested, look into other medications. Those are just prolonging his life though, and if his quality of life isn't better on them, then you already know what the right thing is."

Boxer,3bf993,aedud11,2,Sun Jun 28 21:08:03 2015 UTC,Mental stimulation!  Teach her the names of her toys by hiding them and having her find & fetch them around the house.  You can do this from your couch.  I've found mental workouts with my boxers work twice as effective as physical exertion.
Boxer,3bf993,jobaedraws,2,Sun Jun 28 21:44:44 2015 UTC,"Omg this is a great idea!! I love it! I'm trying to find ideas for indoor play. Right now, we can spend all day outside, but I need some rainy day/winter ideas :)"
Boxer,3bf993,klevenisms204,1 point,Mon Jun 29 00:08:40 2015 UTC,How much time do you spend walking it each day? I recommend a minimum of 30 minutes of vigorous walking each day (that would be about 2 miles for me).   Any further distance is even better.

Boxer,3b2mon,BabyBrute,1 point,Thu Jun 25 13:56:47 2015 UTC,Most definitely. When Caesar was a puppy he got the vaccine and then about a couple weeks later ended up with kennel cough. I just called the vet and described what his cough sounded like and they called in a prescription to the local pharmacy. After a couple days of antibiotics he was fine.
Boxer,3b2mon,samsquanchisagirl,1 point,Thu Jun 25 14:14:15 2015 UTC,My boy is still getting over his kennel cough. My vet says there are come bacterial strains and some viral strains. We were unlucky and got viral. So keep a rag handy and get some ear plugs if your puppy sleeps in the room with you. Good luck and I hope he/she feels better!

I'm so glad yours is healthy and recovered too! That removal surgery stress is no walk in the park. Did yours do a course of prednisone after the surgical removal?"
Boxer,3amu4b,adagrl,2,Mon Jun 22 18:25:50 2015 UTC,Yep.  Bambi took that and benadryl to help her sleep. She was in so much pain and confused after surgery that she cried all night.  I finally called the vet asking what to give to help her. She had a 4 inch incision that took awhile to heal up.  I only let her outside on a leash for about a month to help control her from running wild and reopening her stitches. Had to contain the wiggle butt.

Among other things, they made these organic oatmeal-cinnamon-apple cookies, dipped in carob.    Which of course always needed to be dipped in peanut butter before being doled out.    I tasted one once, and those spoiled brats ate better than me!  I miss them so much, one day I will have another pup."

Reward apology gestures, like them checking where they bit you. Continue polite play, they need party. Redirect to toys or activities. That works. Eventually dogs trained like this have the extra benefit of having a soft mouth. Good luck :-D"

A nylabone or one of his toys... We had a puppy teething toy that you put in the freezer too and he liked that. Eventually he was nipping less and less and then not at all. And it showed him what was ok to chew and what wasn't."

I walk him between 6 and 8 miles a day and he does fine on the walks but running or playing with another dog and he's done for in 5 or ten minutes."

Boxer,39rg2a,OptimusDiabetus,1 point,Sun Jun 14 03:40:54 2015 UTC,I gotta figure out how to train him so he'll have more stamina. I can't run cause of bad knees and I think all the walking just builds his muscles.

I was touched by the random act of kindness and I've taken to sharing it with other Redditors when they experience the same loss that I did.  I'm hoping it provides you with comfort as it did for me.  Internet hugs from me as well.    My Forever Pet by Susanne Taylor  There's something missing in my home,  I feel it day and night,  I know it will take time and strength  before things feel quite right.  But just for now, I need to mourn,  My heart -- it needs to mend.  Though some may say, ""It's just a pet,""  I know I've lost a friend.  You've brought such laughter to my home,  and richness to my days.  A constant friend through joy or loss  with gentle, loving ways.  Companion, friend, and confidante,  A friend I won't forget.  You'll live forever in my heart,  My sweet, forever pet."

Boxer,39nmja,NuclearSun1,3,Sat Jun 13 02:09:18 2015 UTC,"Op I'm sorry for your loss. My last boxer was believed to have had brain cancer. He had a very bad seizure late one night and then  passed away in his favorite spot in the back yard the next morning.  My neighbor found me laying with him full on sobbing and crying. He offered to help me bury him but I declined. I felt it was the last I could do for him and it was something I wanted to do alone.  I take solace in the quality of life he had with me and my family. When I found him he was wandering the streets with bb gun wounds on his back and legs. That night, Halloween  actually,  a family came by and said it was their dog. During conversation they told me they were going to have him put down for biting their daughter.  I asked what happened and to see her wound. She had the tiniest red mark on her hand and they told me that he was eating out of the garbage and they sent her to make him stop. I though the entire scenario was fucked and asked for him. They said sure as long as I signed something saying I wouldn't hold then responsible if he attacked someone.  He turned out to be one of the best dogs I ever had the privilege of living with and had 5 years of pure spoiling. I miss you Mac."

You must not have faith in your ability to train a well mannered dog. Every single rescue I have seen come into our rescue is eager to please and wants the companionship of a pack. You are seriously misguided about what rescuing is all about. These dogs deserve the love more then the ""clean slate"" puppies you speak of. They have been through more in their lives then you can imagine and still can be moulded into beautiful family pets.  Case in point, the beautiful fawn boxer I have laying at my feet who was beaten and sent through 5 different homes before I got him, he was afraid of his own shadow. Now is one of the most well mannered, confident, and playful dogs I have had come through my house. All they need is time and compassion. If you don't have that to give to an animal you shouldn't be bringing an animal home anyways."

I train my dogs to be extremely well manned and extremely obedient. I can take my dog to a crowded store and never have her get further than 2 inches from my leg, without using a leash. I can train just about any puppy you give me to do this, but maybe 1/10 rescues will pick it up.    These dogs deserve the love more then the ""clean slate"" puppies you speak of.   Once again, one of the most ignorant statements I have ever seen.   They have been through more in their lives then you can imagine and still can be moulded into beautiful family pets   Beautiful family pets that you have to constantly keep an eye on around children. If you adopt a dog with a history of abuse and leave it alone around children you're a moron.    All they need is time and compassion. If you don't have that to give to an animal you shouldn't be bringing an animal home anyways.   I agree dogs need compassion. I also however believe that mixed dogs need to be made illegal. The rescue and shelters are always full to the brim and putting down dogs, the vast majority of which are mutts. Stop making mutts and you'll help clean em out and cut the number of dogs being killed."

Boxer,381rj2,AuschwitzBBQTeam,3,Mon Jun 1 20:10:28 2015 UTC,"Please research the Tagamet and Benadryl preventative protocol: http://veraboxers.com/cancer.htm  Please note, I am not the page owner; however,  I referenced the page often during our cancer fight with our girl."
Boxer,383lrr,Dirtyrockstar,3,Mon Jun 1 16:42:34 2015 UTC,"Quality foods include brands like Orijen, Fromm (awesome food for the price, all ingredients from USA, have not had any recalls last time I checked), Taste of the Wild (again, pretty awesome food; downside is that it is produced by diamond, but ToTW itself has not had a recall if I remember right), Acana, and so on. Now, those are a bit pricey. Fortunately, there are foods available that are decently priced for a decent food. These include Kirkland Signature (costco dog food; again owned by diamond, not a bad food), Nature's Domain (costco, basically grain-free version of kirk sig; owned by diamond), Purina One Beyond, etc. Foods you definetley want to stay away from: Beneful (bleh!), and Ol' Roy (I have heard they now offer a grain free line, but if I remember right they get their ingredients from China... they were a part of those very scary recalls back in 2007, and have had 39 recalls since 2005). Science diet is overpriced especially for the quality, as is Royal Canin. So unless your dog needs a prescription diet, I would look for something of better quality.  Good rule of thumb is to look for a specified meat listed first, as whatever is listed first is what the food contains the most of. Example: look for turkey, and not turkey by-product. Turkey meal would be a dehydrated form of turkey and is used to pack the protein into the kibble... many people are picky and just want to confirm the first ingredient would be actual turkey, then turkey meal coming second. I am personally okay with a specified meat meal coming before the specified meat listed in the ingredients, but that is your own call after doing research. Try to steer clear of corn, wheat, and soy (especially when listed in first 3 ingredients). Visit dogfoodadvisor.com if you are unsure about a new food and want to see their review. Many foods do not offer a puppy kibble, as they have an ""all life stages"" option. The general difference in puppy food is that it has extra calories :)  I feed my own dogs Fromm, and Nature's Domain. They poop less on Fromm lol, but they do well on both foods. Good luck with your puppy!! That is going to be extremely exciting :)"

Boxer,383lrr,mercjr443,2,Mon Jun 1 17:38:16 2015 UTC,"Just got a boxer puppy as well and went thru the same thing. Kibbles can be convenient once in a while but the best you could do is to feed your dog less processed foods. Google around Raw Diets for dog or home cooking for dogs. I eat Paleo so essentially my dog eat the same thing I do minus a few things (macademia nuts for example are poisonous to dogs). I feed my dog mostly meats including seafood, some vegetables and rice. Stuff like organ meats, bone marrow, etc is pretty cheap at the grocery... Hopefully this will lead to a happy healthy dog which will be able to keep up with my activity levels! Not an expert but that is what my research led me to..."

Haven't had any ill effect and it's an all stages kind of food so you can start feeding it to him right away.  I don't remember where I read it, but I read somewhere that feeding the dog a puppy formula food is not a good idea cause it contains some growth additives.  I also add raw meat to his food during the weekends and wish I could do it a little more often but it gets rather pricey.  I get compliments on him almost everywhere I go."

I also found a natural ear cleaner thing on amazon that we are using, but since he has an ear infection right now we will wait to use once that's gone, and hopefully it will keep his ears from getting any worse."
Boxer,37mc0h,crookedoldman,2,Thu May 28 19:59:13 2015 UTC,Could be allergies as well. Not sure where you live but my two girls always suffer during Summer. Sometimes we have to give them half a dose of Benadryl to get them some itch relief. (Vet suggested)
Boxer,37mc0h,StrangerMind,2,Thu May 28 18:41:54 2015 UTC,We occasionally have to give our boxer benadryl just to keep him from going at his ear or foot. I always worried too much about keeping him drugged up by doing so. We try to spread it out.   He hears the Benadryl package opening when we do give him one and he comes up excited as ever. I always ask him if he is turning into a junkie. lol

My little girl (14 months) does the paw ""snarl"" almost daily and will sometimes do an excessive head shake-to-ear scratch combo usually followed by an uber cute double paw ear/face rub. i really hope it's not allergies :( but off to the vet we go now.

Boxer,37ej7a,theoldpretender,4,Wed May 27 01:21:57 2015 UTC,That doesn't look good to me. My dogs have no visible remnants of their tail dockings.  Boxers are prone to skin growths and tumors. You should get this checked out.
Boxer,37ej7a,ratstack,3,Wed May 27 02:16:55 2015 UTC,"If you've had him over a year and never noticed it, I'd say it's new and best checked by a vet. Crossing my fingers for you that it's nothing, though."
Boxer,37ej7a,CobhGirl3,2,Wed May 27 02:26:42 2015 UTC,"My boxer has something similar to this on his nub. The vet said his was fine. I don't think it was there when we got him, and I can't remember when it came up. As soon as I saw it I asked the doc. She wasn't worried about it. I hope all is well with your pup."
Boxer,37ej7a,sweetjosephne,1 point,Wed May 27 02:52:01 2015 UTC,"Mine has always had something like that because we got him from a questionable ""breeder"" who basically botched the tail dockings. Just be sure it doesn't get hurt further or infected; the doc will probably have to re-dock the tail even shorter."
Boxer,37ej7a,MaLeskee,1 point,Wed May 27 05:25:09 2015 UTC,"My boxer's tail is also docked, and there is an exposed bit on the tip of her tail that is bald and scarred over. If your dog is five years old, then it should have healed a long time ago. Unfortunately, boxers are prone to growths. Observe it and go to the vet."
Boxer,37ej7a,AmIPopularNow,1 point,Wed May 27 20:49:52 2015 UTC,What happens when they dock a tail is they pull the skin back then dock the tail then they release the skin and stitch it so it covers the bone...sometimes the dogs eat the stitches and this can happen or if someone who doesn't know what they are doing they cut the tail straight and then there is no skin and hair to cover the bone. That's what this looks like.  On the other hand Id think you might have noticed in the year you have had him so maybe check it out especially if inflamed.

We keep a leather collar on our pup (11 months) and only use it for identifying purposes.  The harness only comes on when we take her for a walk.   What kind of food are you feeding Marty?
Boxer,36s20v,Greetings_Stranger,3,Thu May 21 19:04:21 2015 UTC,Our currently 7 month old boxer started having diarrhea around 5 months old. The vet wanted to try to put her on some kind of expensive prescription dog food so I decided to see if she just had a poultry allergy because our previous boxer had the same issue. Sure enough we got her off of a poultry based food to a salmon based one and it fixed her diarrhea issue.
Boxer,36s20v,dfwtokc,2,Thu May 21 19:46:13 2015 UTC,Can I ask what the vet said?    If you haven't yet please get him there!  Ongoing diarrhea and blisters is a miserable experience for your pup.    I would see if allergies could cause one or both of the issues.

I neutered my pup at a year, according to my vet a 8 months - 14 months is a healthy time to snip the boxers because they are still growing."

Boxer,36ogsm,txbobcat,3,Wed May 20 21:43:46 2015 UTC,I was pretty confident he had been stolen from the backyard while I was at work on 4/3/15. Someone who wanted to remain anonymous took him to the animal shelter yesterday . Whoever had him kept him in good shape and did well continuing his Potty training.
Boxer,36ogsm,defragmeout,2,Wed May 20 21:45:24 2015 UTC,So glad you got him back!

PSA: If your dog goes missing, check Craigslist ads (throw a wide net, dogs get transported). Criminals will steal dogs, then list and sell them on Craigslist. Despicable.  OP, I am soooooo happy you got your dog back.  :)"

Boxer,36kt5z,hawksbears2012,3,Wed May 20 02:56:53 2015 UTC,Our boxers shed at a fairly normal rate. The best thing we have done for them is feed them a quality food and they each get a fish oil pill daily which helps and makes their coats shine.
Boxer,36kt5z,IGOTURJEEPTHING,2,Wed May 20 15:35:05 2015 UTC,It's just the time of year when the weather changes and animals shed their winter coats to summer coats.    I've never had a boxer shed a lot though.  As long as he isn't losing hair at an incredible rate it may just be that he's a longer haired boxer and needs the daily grooming sessions to keep the coat pristine.    Don't worry too much about it.  If you enjoy the time with him and he enjoys being brushed then it's a win/win
Boxer,36kt5z,murm87,1 point,Wed May 20 14:14:23 2015 UTC,"They have dog brush attachments that you put on the end of your vacuum. I haven't looked into them AT ALL since our boxer is terrified of the vacuum, but my in laws told us about them when we complained about how much he sheds. Instead of the vacuum brush we just use a dog brush with those stiff but kind of flexible bristles. The metal ones irritated him and he never let us brush him with it, but the black bristles that are a little hard work somewhat well. I still vacuum the carpet 1-2 times a week and wipe down the couches (which he doesn't get on but are still covered in hair) just as often. Some boxers are just hairy-er than others."
Boxer,36kt5z,myh2oisblue,1 point,Wed May 20 18:09:30 2015 UTC,"my Boxer rarely sheds and his coat looks shiny.  I feed him Nutro dog food. We bathe him about twice a month.  But he loves water, so he runs thru the sprinklers all the time and sometimes jumps in the bath with my son."
Boxer,36i9jg,bacon_burtango,3,Tue May 19 16:16:26 2015 UTC,WOW! THAT DOG HAS A GIANT...front left foot.  Very cute!
Boxer,36jt3h,Jigsaw02,4,Tue May 19 22:22:33 2015 UTC,"I have grown up with Boxers and now finally have my own since I moved out of my parents house. One thing I really remember my older brothers and parents doing (because my hands were so tiny) was to grab a hold of their (the boxers) lower jaw and push your thumb down in their mouth, under their tongue. Every time one got a little too rough or mouthy they would do that and it kept the boxer from biting them because it was uncomfortable, and it helped teach them not to bite because they knew what would happen if they did. I hope that helps, I'm sure other people have other solutions, but this has worked for me through the years."
Boxer,36jt3h,clairedowns,4,Wed May 20 04:36:22 2015 UTC,Thank you for the suggestion. I used that technique when he was teething and puppy nipping. That along with gum massage worked quite well. Maybe it's time to take a few steps back.  Again thank you!
Boxer,36jt3h,fireflyfire,3,Wed May 20 05:11:50 2015 UTC,"Is he nipping you while playing or is it just literally as you're walking past him?  I think this will work either way, but basically when puppies are playing together and someone nips too hard, the other will yelp and the game stops.  You can do the same thing! If you're playing or even if he's just walking past and he nips you, just yell the highest pitch, loud 'ow!' you can. Then cross your arms and ignore him, don't make eye contact. The fun is over. If you have a crate for him, put him away. Biting people (even accidentally!) means there is no reward and fun times end immediately.  Our Boxer learnt quite quickly this way and will now only nuzzle or mouth rather than nip or tug at people.  Ignoring a Boxer seems to be the best punishment for them, they are so attention seeking and people-centred they can't cope if you're not looking at them haha."
Boxer,36jt3h,myster_furious,3,Wed May 20 18:59:38 2015 UTC,"He only does it while we are out in our fenced yard and he is off leash. He grabs my forearm and uses enough pressure to leave a bruise. My mistake is standing still but NOT crossing my arms...I will do so from now on.  So right about ignoring a Boxer, never saw a more desolate pup when he's being ignored.   Good news is that today we were in the yard doing our thing and I was carrying a flower pot in my hand...Jack made a move toward it but I was a bit more alert. A sharp ""leave it"" worked this time, but timing aside he was definitely less amped today.  Work in progress, but oh so worth it! Thank you for taking the time for responding to my post, I will remember to cross my arms in the future :)"
Boxer,36jt3h,shooter_mcgavin2,2,Wed May 20 20:40:13 2015 UTC,"Would be interested to know how this is working out for you.  My 7 month old has been doing something similar with jumping and 'attacking' me.  I've started to cross my arms and ignore her, and it does seem to be working."

Short little tail is going, so he's obviously happy with the love and attention he's getting. We can't afford a vet bill, so I'm gonna wait until Monday, when the vet office his rabies tag is from is open. Got the number, so I'll be able to get some information. I know I shouldn't be looking a gift horse in the mouth, but what kind of idiot dumps a dog without taking the tags off? That's like putting up a sign ""please, arrest me""... Oh well, the stupidity will be their downfall.  I see some scars on him, with one that looks like an elongated cut on the side. I'm inclined to think they tried to use him to fight, and he wouldn't do so, and that's why they got rid of him.   There's more here to look at, better pictures. http://imgur.com/a/yM7X0"
Boxer,3668nb,WendellX,5,Sat May 16 16:12:10 2015 UTC,Maybe someone stole him. He could have people out there looking for him. But if that's not the case you should report them to the authorities.

Her husband let him out unsupervised and he ran off, but got picked up by the owner who'd been looking for him.... Seems he really was stolen....

He barely has any back teeth, it's like they're barely poking out of the gums... larger, but barely there. Don't know what that says about his age... I've never dealt with boxers before, but I know how to care for animals... You pick up these tricks being a pet boarder, which was what I did as a part time job as a teenager."
Boxer,3668nb,defragmeout,3,Sat May 16 18:46:58 2015 UTC,"Poor thing!!! How do his teeth look? If he's malnourished he might be a little sensitive. Try giving him some wet food which would be easier to chew. Barring that, put some water in the dry food and let it turn to mush.  My boxer has good teeth but is a SUPER picky eater (I call him Diva Dog) and sometimes simply refuses to eat no matter what I do. It really scared me until I took him to the vet and she said as long as he iisn't getting too thin, not to worry about it - just keep to the usual schedule and when he's hungry...he'll eat."

Apparently it's a good hypoallergenic option but is a little more pricey and they would have had to order it in for him. He's done well on lamb for over a year but seems to be having a flare up this spring. Hard to tell if it's environmental or food allergy flaring up. He has both. He's on allergy medication daily. Poor bugger. He also had an anaphylactic reaction to a spider bite, his throat was closing when I came in the door from work. My boy is allergic to life lol"

Boxer,35qna5,diesel8358,-7,Fri May 15 02:35:58 2015 UTC,I give my dog Natural Balance Vegetarian formula just because I'm a vegan and felt like it was a solid decision. She loves it though! My vet approved it and everything too.
Boxer,35qna5,beingabitch,5,Tue May 12 19:25:44 2015 UTC,"This has got to be the stupidest reason for feeding an animal a vegetarian diet.  Do what you want for yourself but don't force your diet on your animal who will eat anything once they get hungry enough and can't straight up tell you that he's not ""vegan"".  IDIOT."
Boxer,35qna5,n2speed125,-3,Wed May 13 14:50:04 2015 UTC,I don't see what the problem is. She gets all of the necessary nutrients she needs.   Some people want to feed their dog $10 dollar food from Walmart and I want to feed my dog this.   I've done a lot of research and educated myself on the subject before I made my decision and I'm very comfortable with it. But thanks for your input.
Boxer,35qna5,beingabitch,4,Wed May 13 23:17:37 2015 UTC,"Dogs are natural carnivores and require protein from meat. I'm sure in your head you justified your poor choice but you're essentially torturing your dog and denying him a healthy diet all because it seems ""right"" to you. It's in line with the people that deny immunizations to their kids cause they ""feel"" it's not needed."
Boxer,35qna5,n2speed125,-3,Wed May 13 23:26:16 2015 UTC,I don't know if I could go so far as to compare it with that considering I have discussed it with my vet who okayed it but whatever floats your boat.   Protein is protein. My dog gets all of the amino acids that she needs. Same with vitamins and minerals. Technically dogs are omnivores. She doesn't eat this because she's starving and I'm torturing her. She thrives on it. I acknowledge that I am denying my dog this ancient desire to eat meat but this is 2015 and my dog can eat a vegetarian diet and be healthy and happy. I know that I can't convince you that I'm not some crazy hippie but that's fine. Enjoy the rest of your day.
Boxer,35qna5,beingabitch,1 point,Wed May 13 23:38:40 2015 UTC,That is what we are feeding. It has done well. Although I do not think dogs or humans should be vegetarians normally. To each his/her own
Boxer,35qna5,beingabitch,-2,Wed May 13 01:57:48 2015 UTC,"Yes exactly. I've been a vegetarian/vegan for over 13 years and am never going back and hopefully my dog isn't either. But if for some reason her veterinarian suggested that we switch diets for her health, I would do it."

She also locked me out of my bedroom once, trying this. She rode shotgun, always, and never surrendered that right, no matter how decrepit she got. She had supernatural hearing, attuned to the rattle of a lid against the peanut butter jar. Willful and stubborn, when she didn't want to go any further, she won by outlasting me. She bullied little dogs, kissed up to big ones and would try to climb in your lap while you were standing up. I am going to miss her something fierce."

He doesn't seem bothered by it.  I was figuring I would take him to the vet in a couple weeks if it didn't clear up.  He has been to the vet for checkups, and seems in fine health."

And if your guys is losing it the same time of year that is most likely it. We started giving her melatonin at night which is suppose to help. we also give her a half a teaspoon of coconut oil with her food once a day, started her on a high quality food and get her out in the sun as much as we can....Not sure which of those is helping the most but her fur is SOOOO much better.

Boxer,34s0jb,PolarBill,2,Tue May 5 00:29:19 2015 UTC,"Good idea, and its also a good idea to start enforcing good behavior now instead of letting it go ""because he is a puppy.""  Have patience and be consistent, and you will see results."
Boxer,34s0jb,bbeach88,2,Tue May 5 01:15:07 2015 UTC,"It sounds like he may not be getting very much exercise. Boxers have tons of energy, and if they don't get a good outlet for it, it comes out in every interaction they have. A tired boxer is a well-behaved boxer. They really need 60 minutes of good exercise daily, at least 30 minutes though would probably be enough.  It sounds like you might not be too familiar with dog training. There's plenty of media to help you with that if you want to do it yourself, although you need to be patient with boxers, getting upset will only slow the process down. If you don't think you have the patience or you think you need assistance, definitely go to a dog trainer for guidance."
Boxer,34s0jb,iCal3b,1 point,Mon May 4 22:09:19 2015 UTC,"Thanks, i found a lady who comes and does in home training for a 6 week course. The only problem is that she's on medical leave until July.

Boxer,34s0jb,murm87,3,Tue May 5 00:27:38 2015 UTC,"I would try a spray bottle with water in it... to try to get his attention off of your guest and turn it to the uncomfortable water spray... harmless but may be effective, also try a shock collar... I bought one online and it has a vibrate mode that I use because it will not harm the dog it just distracts them and takes their focus off of the excitement of the guest... oor maybe even try more walks to unleash all his energy... boxers are good at storing all that energy and it doesnt take much to release it... a simple walk for 10-15 mins... a jog/run... or bring him to a park and toss a ball/frissbee around... I have 2 boxers and the little one loves when we have guest over, soo we'll take them for a nice long walk earlier that day to get his energy out and our guest arrives he could care less that theres new faces around"

Boxer,34s0jb,TheRagingRhino,1 point,Mon May 4 21:44:23 2015 UTC,"Our vet said it's best to wait until he's a year old because it helps fight some types of cancer. I haven't done any research on the subject, i just assumed she was a pro, and i took her at her word."
Boxer,34s0jb,n2speed125,3,Tue May 5 00:25:34 2015 UTC,"I have never heard that, very interesting.  As others have said, if you neuter him now it may help with some of the excess energy.  That was the only reason I asked."
Boxer,34s0jb,bacon_burtango,2,Tue May 5 13:45:34 2015 UTC,"He thinks that he's the alpha in the house. He's not being trained correctly. I have a 4 year old that I've had since he's been 7 weeks old and while he does get excited when people come over, he will listen to me when he gets out of hand. He hasn't been fixed cause I choose not to.  He gets walked for a minimum of three hours a day and is the sweetest dog I've ever met."

Boxer,33voa9,Something_for_Sordo,2,Sun Apr 26 23:37:17 2015 UTC,"From my experience, they become a dynamic duo, keeping each other entertained. You still need to provide space for them to get their physical energy out, but their mental energy is pretty much taken care of with each other and their humans. I still take both hiking and to the dog park, but feel less guilty if I have to skip a day in a busy week. I live in a small townhouse, with a small yard and both get their energy out with a couple of trips to the dog park during the week and a good hike on the weekend (dog park fine here too, but I like hiking). Otherwise just play with your dogs when you have time after work and they will always be happy, wiggling good-balls."

Boxer,33lbxl,myster_furious,3,Thu Apr 23 13:31:55 2015 UTC,Ace should absolutely never be given to Boxers!  I would be seriously questioning why your vet prescribed a drug that is listed in veterinary manuals as one not to be used with Boxers.  http://americanboxerclub.org/ace_boxers.html  http://www.jlhweb.net/BOSS/ace.htm
Boxer,33lbxl,cb83580,2,Thu Apr 23 17:57:50 2015 UTC,"My boxer's breeder warned about ace, giving us a copy of the latest literature. I relayed the info to my vet, she flagged his chart to prevent dispensing ace to him.  There are other meds than can safely be used. I'd rather err on the side of caution!"
Boxer,33lbxl,Jigsaw02,1 point,Thu Apr 23 19:44:24 2015 UTC,"I do not give my dog Ace, though I did once in the past before I knew about the breed's sensitivity. She suffered no ill effects, but it is not worth it to me to risk it again. I told my vet to put NO ACE on her file. I don't mind if they think I'm crazy. As far as being worried about telling them what to do, you have a right to tell them you don't want your dog to receive this medicine. As long as you are polite about it, they shouldn't mind at all. These days, if Nym needs a light sedative, I just give her some benedryl."
Boxer,33lbxl,defragmeout,1 point,Thu Apr 23 14:22:23 2015 UTC,"I've been told the rule of thumb is one pill per 25 lb's, but even in older boxers, i haven't seen it sedate them at all. How much do you give?"
Boxer,33lbxl,PolarBill,1 point,Thu Apr 23 14:38:20 2015 UTC,"She only had one 25mg pill.  Half of it at first, then the other half an hour later.  She is around 33 pounds.  It knocked her flat out for 6 to 7 hours.  Just scary to see her in that state then think about heart complications, etc..."
Boxer,33lbxl,PolarBill,2,Thu Apr 23 14:57:22 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry, I was referring to the benedryl. I didn't have much else to add to /u/defragmeout 's comment So I didn't include that we also do not allow ACE because of all the warnings."
Boxer,33lbxl,defragmeout,2,Thu Apr 23 15:08:53 2015 UTC,"Oh ok.  Yea even at my dog's size, the Benadryl seemed to calm her a bit, for a day or 2.  After a while, there was no noticeable effect.  Extremely stressful trying to keep this ball of energy from hurting herself!"
Boxer,33lbxl,defragmeout,1 point,Thu Apr 23 15:35:13 2015 UTC,Tolerance for the Benedryl does build up quickly. You may ask the vet what all they offer in a rx sedative that isn't Ace.

Boxer,33hrmy,petuniathebox,6,Wed Apr 22 16:57:51 2015 UTC,Sorry for your loss. Tell us a bit about him...
Boxer,33hrmy,PhatPhuk,24,Wed Apr 22 17:15:13 2015 UTC,"I would love to :) he was such a special guy.  Everyone loved little bully.  He and his older sister, Gertie, were from the same mom and dad one year apart and they were just an inseparable dream team.  They are the boxers that launched a thousand boxer adoptions.  I can't even count how many people have adopted boxers after meeting these two.  They were so goofy and hilarious, yet ridiculously emotionally intelligent.  Tonka was always a mama's boy, and he would just know what I needed.  If I was crying he would just rest his head on my shoulder and nuzzle his nose in my neck, if I was stressed he would put his little paw on my hand and just stand there until I felt better.  We fixed him before his sleeker adult fur came in (I think he was a late bloomer) so he was always incredible fluffy and soft.  He had big soulful eyes, and I would quite often wake up in the middle of the night and the first thing my eyes would adjust on is his little face just staring at me.  No matter how sick he might have been these past few days he still would jump up and claw at me in frenzied excitement, I have a scratch on my arm from him and it is so weird to me that he isn't here anymore.  He loved birds and by loved birds I mean he did everything in his power to attack them.  He always missed, but one time he got one, and I remember the shocked look on his face as he looked at me, then at the pigeon, then back at me, like, ""WHAT NOW??""  The pigeon waddled off in the confusion.  He was a snuggler and super sensitive.  I once joked that he had crack head teeth and his smile closed, he drew his chin in, gave me a death stare, then turned around and laid facing the other way.  I had to apologize for like an hour, I swear.  He would also flex his back legs for us, then look at us like ""yeah?? you see that shit??""  As with most boxers, he was as human as it gets.  Thanks for asking, talking about Tonk makes me happy."
Boxer,33hrmy,ManicOwl,5,Wed Apr 22 17:54:01 2015 UTC,Now I'm crying. I'm sorry he's gone.
Boxer,33hrmy,eyeseayoupea,3,Wed Apr 22 18:19:06 2015 UTC,Get the onions out of here.
Boxer,33hrmy,Derpetite,3,Wed Apr 22 19:08:13 2015 UTC,Thankyou so much for sharing about Tonk. He sounds amazing. I'm so sorry he's gone

Boxer,33hrmy,macarlo,2,Wed Apr 22 21:16:33 2015 UTC,He sounds like an amazing friend to have had. I'm sorry for your loss and I know I can't help but remember that he would not like to see you sad and what would make him happiest is seeing you happy :)
Boxer,33hrmy,PhatPhuk,3,Wed Apr 22 23:56:07 2015 UTC,"I lost my boy a few weeks ago too. He used to come to work with me every day and greet all our customers with a big waggy tail. The first few days without him were really hard with everyone asking about him, but I soon found that talking about him helped me remember all the good times, and helped me through the grief. Now I always make a point to ask people about their lost loved one.  Keep telling Tonka's stories and he'll always be with you."
Boxer,33hrmy,timbo4815,2,Wed Apr 22 19:36:16 2015 UTC,"I am so sorry for your loss as well.

I have been talking about my little Truck all day to anyone who will listen.    Thank you again :)"
Boxer,33hrmy,lordnecro,4,Wed Apr 22 21:06:29 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry about your loss.  Five and a half years later and I'm still hurting from losing my dog of 17 years, he was basically my brother.  Isn't it funny how we can develop a stronger relationship with an animal than with another human being?"
Boxer,33hrmy,Zotmaster,2,Wed Apr 22 20:10:34 2015 UTC,"Oh my goodness, 17 years!  I am sorry for your loss as well.  They are just so loving and honest and sincere in everything they do, it is easy to make these insane bonds.  It sucks so bad when they go, but they are worth every bit of it."
Boxer,33hrmy,NahNotOnReddit,2,Thu Apr 23 00:38:05 2015 UTC,"As a teenager I got a dog, and we were also like brothers. He died a few years ago, and it took me about 3 years before I could even stand to think about him. It has been about 4-5 years now, and I am not sure if I could stand to look at his picture.  My wife decided she wanted a puppy a few months ago, and it was hard to think about getting another dog, even though mine had passed so long ago.  It really is crazy how attached we get."
Boxer,33hrmy,Bridonnelly,4,Wed Apr 22 23:59:35 2015 UTC,"/u/crow_baby shared a poem with me a couple years ago when I lost my last boxer.  I was touched by the random act of kindness and I've taken to sharing it with other Redditors when they experience the same loss that I did.  I'm hoping it provides you with comfort as it did for me.  Internet hugs from me as well.    My Forever Pet by Susanne Taylor  There's something missing in my home,  I feel it day and night,  I know it will take time and strength  before things feel quite right.  But just for now, I need to mourn,  My heart -- it needs to mend.  Though some may say, ""It's just a pet,""  I know I've lost a friend.  You've brought such laughter to my home,  and richness to my days.  A constant friend through joy or loss  with gentle, loving ways.  Companion, friend, and confidante,  A friend I won't forget.  You'll live forever in my heart,  My sweet, forever pet.    Also.  My last boxer was named Tonka.  Reading this one brought a tear to my eye.  More internet hugs from me."

Boxer,33gyc0,Never_Coming_Down,4,Wed Apr 22 13:11:08 2015 UTC,"Might want to have it looked at by a vet, my boyfriend's boxers had a few lumps and bumps that looked like that, and they turned out to be benign growths. Sometimes they would change a little in size. I would get it looked at to be sure though! Better safe than sorry :)."
Boxer,33gyc0,mooper_,6,Wed Apr 22 14:05:20 2015 UTC,"You should for sure have this checked by a vet. Unfortunately, it does have the potential to be cancerous, so sooner is better than later. Ours had one and it ended up being benign, the vet says a lot of the times they are, but to have each one checked for that chance that they aren't."
Boxer,33gyc0,DisheveledSaint,3,Wed Apr 22 14:12:54 2015 UTC,"Is your dog young?  Like 3yrs or younger?  Looks like a button tumor.  They occur on young dogs on extremities and can come and go within a few months without issue.  If your dog is older than 3, it could turn malignant.  Either way, go to the vet to make sure."
Boxer,33gyc0,envregs,3,Wed Apr 22 15:14:31 2015 UTC,"A vet should definitely aspirate it, do a check. That looks way too much like a tumor/growth. Good chance it's benign, but it needs to be looked at. Boxers are notorious for tumors. And white boxers even more so."
Boxer,33gyc0,ZRX1200R,2,Wed Apr 22 16:26:38 2015 UTC,"Yes get it checked by a professional. Everyone is claiming it could be benign or worse, one of my girls had something in that spot that was similar looking and it was just a cyst that got infected. If you squeezed it was something r/popping would have appreciated. It's hard to tell from the photo.   Again go get it checked."
Boxer,33gyc0,KhaoticOrd3r,2,Wed Apr 22 14:40:59 2015 UTC,Mine has the same looking thing. Vet said it was a benign tumor/mole that usually clears up on its own after a couple of months. Of course though you need to have your own vet confirm and run tests and what not.  edit: My dog's diagnosis was confirmed via lab work. So really take your dog to the vet
Boxer,33gyc0,I_Like_Turtlz,2,Wed Apr 22 15:37:03 2015 UTC,"could be a tumor, fungus, mange, bacteria.  Take him to the vet and have them check it over."
Boxer,33gyc0,AuschwitzBBQTeam,2,Wed Apr 22 15:45:44 2015 UTC,"Mine did too, had to removed, was a tumer"
Boxer,33gyc0,requiemsoull,2,Wed Apr 22 16:13:13 2015 UTC,Do you notice your dog licking it's paws a lot? My boy developed something that looks like this on the side of his paw after he developed allergies. We spray his feet with a anti itch spray and they go down. They pop back up if we forget to spray his feet for a few days. If they go untreated they can develop into tumors and become cancerous.
Boxer,33gyc0,XectriK,2,Wed Apr 22 16:24:10 2015 UTC,"All the advice here is great.  Definitely see the vet.  My female developed this exact thing at 4 years old.  Went to the vet, and we tried a series of treatments - antibiotics, ringworm, prednisone...Eventually 2 months later, we had it removed and biopsied.  Benign growth, but it had the potential to be a mast cell tumor."
Boxer,33gyc0,k-diddly,2,Wed Apr 22 16:35:45 2015 UTC,"I'm going to sound like a jerk here so for that I apologize.

Boxer,33gyc0,beaker87,2,Fri Apr 24 10:51:40 2015 UTC,"My dog had one of those on his wrist joint a few years ago. Vet removed it for biopsy and sent it to state... Turned out to be a fungal infection under the skin that could've been easily treated with anti fungal meds but instead was removed and he has a gnarly scar on his wrist. If you take him in, ask them to aspirate the mass first before removal :-/"
Boxer,33haq4,justwanttolurk,2,Wed Apr 22 14:54:19 2015 UTC,"If the dog doesn't appear to be in pain, it could just be a stage one luxating patella which generally doesn't require treatment. If it is higher than stage one, arthritis will occur in the joint if left untreated. Surgery is not cheap, but if deemed necessary at least you can be proactive and have it done while the dog is still young before serious damage is done. Here is an article about surgery. Amazon sells canine braces to keep the knee stable. You may also look into glucosamine, chondroitin and MSM supplements for general joint health."
Boxer,33haq4,defragmeout,2,Thu Apr 23 13:00:45 2015 UTC,She does not appear to be in pain.  Mostly just a confused look on her face as to what is happening. :(  I am able to massage it back into place and she instantly goes back to walking or sadly jumping in circles.    Was looking into supplements and will ask the vet about those.  Have an apt on Friday.    The cost of surgery is not an issue.  We have the ability to pay outright and also have dog insurance that has already said they would cover 90% the cost anyways.  The main concern I had with surgery was recovery time.  I walk my girl about 1.5 miles a day and she gets pretty upset if we break her routine.  She's only 10 months and I am not sure how 2-3 months of limited activity would do to her.    Also concerning is from what I have found is this condition is not typical for the breed/age combo my pup is at.  A friend informed me of the situation with her dog but she has a 9 year old Yorkie that weights 12lbs.  A big difference from my 10 month / 44lb girl.  I am new to the area where I live and there is not a boxer meetup here so I hoped I could find a similar conversation that I had with my friend but breed and even possibly age related.    Thanks for the links.  Much appreciated.
Boxer,33haq4,defragmeout,2,Thu Apr 23 13:28:02 2015 UTC,"Be careful not to overexert her while her joints are still developing. I know the recovery time seems like a long time, but think of it as an investment in future playtimes. I have read that some people  sedate their dog for a week or so after these kinds of surgeries. I don't know that I would choose to do that, though it is an option - BUT - Do be sure that your vet does not give or administer Acepromazine to your dog."
Boxer,33haq4,buttsnuggler,1 point,Thu Apr 23 14:06:44 2015 UTC,you should probably ask your vet
Boxer,33haq4,buttsnuggler,0,Wed Apr 22 15:48:41 2015 UTC,Obviously will be doing that but the vet we have is new to us as Cali is our first dog and she is less than a year old.    The reason I am asking questions to other boxer owners is to get perspective and educate myself before I go into a vet so I can ask the right questions and know all sides.  I have been told of vets who are 'cut first' and fix in surgery for issues that were not always necessary.  But thanks for your input.

When I wrapped pills in cheddar cheese, my boy would know and would drop the pill out. With goat or blue cheese, which is also easier to mold around the pill, he gobbles it down. I think the strong smell of the cheese helps to better disguise the smell of the pill inside."

If she needs those pills and won't swallow them voluntarily, it's really the only option.  I've been through this recently with my old boy. He developed pancreatitis and was off his food, so wouldn't eat the pills in anything we tried. It was heartbreaking knowing that he needed them, but that we couldn't get them in him, and I'm sure it's breaking your heart in the same way or you wouldn't be here asking advice.  I wish now that our vet had showed us how to pop them down his throat. If they had, he might still be with us now.  By all means try everything you can to get her to eat them, but if she absolutely won't, then get some help as soon as you can, don't wait till tomorrow."
Boxer,32u7iu,flowerscup,1 point,Thu Apr 16 22:07:45 2015 UTC,I had to wrap my boxers pills in pieces of raw steak. He ate it with no issues. The cheese didn't work cause he somehow knew that something was wrong and would eat the cheese and spit out the pill.

Boxer,32p0j2,ExoThrow,3,Wed Apr 15 15:35:55 2015 UTC,Does he ever appear to be in any form of pain? Dogs can turn pain into being aggressive.   My sister's mastiff went through about exactly what you're talking about only they ended up finding out that she had hip dysplasia. Whenever she was in pain from the dysplasia is when she would become aggressive.
Boxer,32p0j2,Fuck_Off_Cancer,1 point,Wed Apr 15 20:09:42 2015 UTC,Could he be having issues with his eye sight or hearing?
Boxer,32p0j2,Fuck_Off_Cancer,1 point,Thu Apr 16 00:14:44 2015 UTC,I agree with the others. First you should probably try to rule out any underlying physical issue. I would suggest taking him to a good vet with your concerns.
Boxer,32q1am,Boxer1478,1 point,Wed Apr 15 20:08:17 2015 UTC,"This happened to my boxer a couple of months ago.  The day it started, it was pretty obvious he was not feeling well.  He was pretty sluggish and he ate some grass and vomited in the back yard.  After that day, he seemed to feel fine and acted normal as far as playfulness and activity but would hardly eat any dog food (went from 4 cups/day to about a half cup/day).  I even bought him a different food thinking he was just bored with what he had been eating.  I took him to the vet after about 5 days. She pushed and prodded on his tummy and said she didn't think we shouldn't do x-rays since he had no sensitivity to all the poking and he was pretty well hydrated.  She ended up giving him a shot of antibiotics and a shot of Famotidine with instructions for me to give him Famotidine pills for the next 7 days.  His appetite came back after that to where he was eating normally after about a week.  I have no idea if the antibiotics or Famotidine had anything to do with it or if he was just having a spell where he didn't feel like eating and then he felt like eating again.  I'd give it a few more days as long as your dog is not in any pain, plays normally, and is well hydrated.  You might try changing up some of the ingredients in his raw diet or supplementing with some commercial dog food in the meantime.  If it goes on for much more than a week, a trip to the vet is probably warranted no matter what."

Boxer,31t7kr,Padfo0t,2,Wed Apr 8 15:12:14 2015 UTC,I have a 9 month old boxer and my whole family has had many boxers over the years. The breed is very known for their high energy. The usually will start to calm down at about 2 years old. We take our dog to the dog park at least every other day. We do not walk him for long periods of time because we have been told that excessive walking in young dogs can lead to hip problems later in life. Boxers also really need to run. And I really mean to run. We also have a big enough yard for him to run even on the days that he doesn't go to the off leash dog park. We also have so many chewies and toys for him to chew on. This is a great way too use up some of that endless boxer energy. We also spend at least a half hour every night just playing. We usually do this about an hour before bed so that he has time to settle down. Boxers are such great dogs but it is so important for them use up that energy. A schedule will also help. Lots of luck to you and your boxer baby.
Boxer,31t7kr,Pitapot,2,Wed Apr 8 00:50:50 2015 UTC,"Exercise, exercise.... oh and EXERCISE!!!!!!!!  Dog needs to run and play and then run some more."
Boxer,31t7kr,hooooves,1 point,Wed Apr 8 04:21:27 2015 UTC,"My bosses have 16 month old boxer, he's still got as much energy as when he was 2 months old. When they can't be at home to walk him regularly they put him into a doggy daycare. If money isn't an issue I'd suggest trying that. Whenever they pick him up from daycare he's a lot calmer for the rest of the night and sleeps through instead of being up crazy early.  Good luck!"
Boxer,31t7kr,media_bachanalia,1 point,Tue Apr 7 23:55:54 2015 UTC,"Like others have said, exercise!  Dog parks, daycare, anything to get him / her out running. Boxers are full of energy until 2-3.   A second boxer would be ideal but not always possible. Lol  Good luck"
Boxer,31t7kr,Sachmo78,1 point,Sat Apr 11 13:27:00 2015 UTC,"Lots of walks, lots of exercise, lots of time at the dog park. Keep him/her stimulated and moving around. That way he/she will burn off as much energy as possible. That what my wife and I did with Miley, it took a while, but now she is all go no stop whenever we are home (mostly). Then right about 7pm, boom!  She turns into a snuggle pups. She is 20 months now. Sleeps all night from about 7pm till I get up for work around 5:30. My morning routine is what usually wakes her up. If I make a point to be quiet she will stay snuggled up with the wife till about 8."

Boxer,31hlxh,eslam102192,10,Sun Apr 5 03:52:22 2015 UTC,"They are high energy and need daily exercise. Ours need to RUN. They love people. They LOVE kids. They are giant cuddle bugs and like to be with their human pack.  I think they are average-smart for the dog world. They do train easily, but you have to be consistent. Ours crate-trained effortlessly.  They love outings and adventure.   Their short snouts make them susceptible to overheating. They will need shade and AC if you live in a hot climate. They are definitely ""inside"" dogs, and will spend most of their time on your couch.  They tend toward cancer and heart disease, so high quality food and regular vet care are essential.  Mostly, they are goofy, friendly, love-bombs."

Boxer,31hlxh,gottakilldazombies,6,Mon Apr 6 17:23:58 2015 UTC,"There's a great 'for dummies' book on boxers that I read.  They are rambunctious but eager to please.  I think the biggest hurdle with Duchess was jumping up on people.  She's almost 8 and we're still working on stay though.  Like I said, they are eager to please though.  She used to get really upset when she knew I wanted her to do something but she just didn't know what it was.  I think they are by far the friendliest and most loving breed.  They always want to be with you and included in anything going on.  They have absolutely no concept of personal space, that might bug some people, they love cuddling and insist they are lap dogs.  Resistance to that is futile.  Sometimes i feel cold on my nose in the morning, and open my eyes to a little wet nose and two eyes staring directly at me inches from my face."

Boxer,31hlxh,Shadow1ane,2,Sun Apr 5 12:46:46 2015 UTC,"we will have our boxer for 2 years next month, we got him when he was 5 months old.  I would have to say there is nothing better than having a boxer.  He is smart, sweet and wonderful.  He was easy to train (practically house broke himself) When he wants to play he has a ton of energy, but he does sleep a lot at other times.  we have 2 teens at home and he loves them and all their friends.  He doesn't really jump on people and when we have the holidays here he is so good and just sleeps under the table.  The biggest issue we had was FOOD, he has a delicate digestive system (we went months with diarrhea ) we tried changing food a few times and finally took him to the vet, he gave him some antibiotics and put him on the Royal Canin limited ingredient diet.  We have since been feeding him Natures Balance LID diet (much cheaper than the vet stuff) and he seems fine.  we really never give him table food.  Also the only biscuits we use are Nature's Variety Instinct Grain-Free Biscuits with Chicken Meal, Cranberries & Garlic Dog Treats. should you adopt a boxer I think you will be very happy."

Boxer,30q8b8,walkerlucas,2,Sun Mar 29 19:40:50 2015 UTC,"I certainly hope she finds a nice family. I have adopted two senior boxers before, and they couldn't have been better friends. Is it just me, or is $250 crazy steep for an adoption fee? My local animal shelter charges $30 to adopt a senior (half off regular adoptions). Of course the money isn't what is important, but I am curious if this is the standard rate for most rescues."
Boxer,30q8b8,tbrean,3,Mon Mar 30 04:08:55 2015 UTC,BRO does vet checks and also does bigger rescues - they just brought in a group of 5 Boxers. Becuause they're working with a smaller number of dogs I think that's why the fees are higher.
Boxer,30pzl2,pescurris,4,Sun Mar 29 18:27:51 2015 UTC,"Well, your first stop should be a veterinarian. First, visit with your girl Ona to find if she is healthy enough for pregnancy. Your vet should be able to explain the basics of how the happy couple gets down to business when the time comes.   Next, make sure you understand what this all implies, what you owe to your girl now that you have her impregnated, what you have to do to care for the puppies, able to meet veterinary costs for the pregnancy, and the litter (food, shots, papers, docking if desired).   While boxers are in pretty high demand, you need to prepare for the possibility that multiple pups may not get adopted. (will you care for them long term?)   You also need to be sure you have the proper contracts for selling the dogs (I'm guessing you're in the US, people are only to happy to sue over trivial BS). This probably means meeting with a lawyer beforehand to get this figured out (probably ask the AKC for lawyer referral).   All that aside, I once went to look at a boxer pup that had been carried by a girl like yours (i.e. Not a professional breeder, just a family dog that had puppies) and they managed it fine.  Like having a human baby, you have to be sure you understand your responsibilities in caring for your girl and her pups until they have been adopted. There are too many unwanted puppies in the world that have to be euthanized, do your best not to add to that number."
Boxer,30pzl2,Sir_Dude,2,Mon Mar 30 17:26:36 2015 UTC,"Thank you very much for the info! I'm going next week to the vet in order to make sure Ona is in perfect condition.  I am living in Spain, and even before getting Ona pregnant I know 4 people that I trust willing to get a boxer. The last thing I would want to do would be to add up the number of unwanted dogs. About the responsability of having them there would be no problem financially nor about having enough room for them. I am willing to have them until everyone of them has a nice home, and since I don't want money for them I know it won't be difficult.  Next stop, vet!"

Boxer,2zymrf,beingabitch,5,Mon Mar 23 00:48:18 2015 UTC,"Nobody derps like a Boxer.  Nobody.  For some reason, between our own experience, and he pics I've seen including OP's, the brindles dont look quite as derpy if it's a still picture.  In motion, they're all the same.  Picture this: walking down a level dirt road, Java and I. It's been hard cold for a long time, and today is the first ""warm"" day in about a month. I'm walking along, she's off-lead because the terrain and her temperament give me time to hook her up if another dog comes along. From behind me, I hear her approaching at a run, but I'm still looking forward. Then, starting at the edge of my vision on my left is a moving object, man-high, but silent.  Somehow Java had taken it into her head to leap when she got close to me, and as she went by me, she was nearly vertical, not touching the ground. But that wasn't what caused me to nearly hawk up a lung (non-smoker) in laughter, it was because as she was flying by me, she was smiling at me. Those lower teeth were jutting out in what passes for a Boxer grin, and knowing this Boxer girl for 8 1/2 years, I know she had been ""struck by a thought"", and was still thinking ""Isn't this warm weather great!"" as she went sailing by, a flying, smiling, brindle derp, loving life in the moment, and inviting (all) to join."
Boxer,2zymrf,Old_School_New_Age,2,Mon Mar 23 10:24:56 2015 UTC,"It's true, boxers are like no other dogs! I used to love ALL dogs equally but since I got Marina all other dogs aren't interesting enough for me haha."
Boxer,2zymrf,Old_School_New_Age,2,Mon Mar 23 17:19:31 2015 UTC,"Here is a list of all dogs I or my family/close friends have owned (breeds I know well): (In no particular order)  Border Collie (3)  Husky  Pug  Golden Retriever  Great Pyrenees  Black and Chocolate lab  Newfoundland  Mini-Poodle  Shepherd-X  Dachshund  Greyhound  Papillon  Boxer  Irish Wolfhound (2)  Rat Terrier (5, much to my dismay)  About seventy-five different kinds of mutts.  Mini Schnauzer  Sheltie  I don't know all these breeds equally well, but I do know who the two smartest breeds on that list are. The Border and the Boxer.  My first Border Collie was my best friend from ~8-20.  Saved my step-brother's life on a verbal command, just like Lassie in the old TV show.  And I swear to you, even though Borders are pretty much universally agreed upon as the most intelligent breed, my current Boxer friend is all of that for sure.  I know a lot of Regal Derp owners will disagree with me, but I have watched the actions of smart and not-so-smart dogs/breeds all my life, and I tell you the Boxer, with its nearly pathological need to please, works harder to please their person than any other breed this dog-lover has encountered.  I have run out of synonyms and colloquialisms for the word ""walk"", when apprising my wife of my plans. Java even understands ""going"" means ""out"".  The reason Boxers and Borders in specific and dogs in general get along with people so well and not coincidentally, consistently out-perform monkeys, chimps, and the great Apes in the ""Do what the scientist is trying to get you to do"" competitions.  This seeming failure on the part of primates to prove their superiority (and in what should be handy fashion) drove certain elements of the scientific community nearly crazy.  We long-time, multi-breed dog people were sure whether or not there was a lack in the primates, there was something inside the dog that was aiding them in their triumphs over their supposedly smarter fellow mammals.  Take a look at listings 2-6. All this time they literally have been our best friend, and we're still finding out really important stuff about how they manage to interact so well with most two-leggers, to the point where they sometimes anticipate our movements.  And maybe you heard about the little English doggie who could predict exactly when his owner was coming home, and always (except for the days where he failed to anticipate his owner), the dog's failure said to be attributable to geomagnetic forces and the like.  Back on topic, Boxers work harder to please, in general than any breed I know. Our girl greets us at the door with a ""gift"", one of, and usually her newest toy.  Unless she has misplaced it, in which case you could be greeted with a rubber chicken or a custom-trimmed (by Java) plastic dragon. Minus half the wings, the outer half with the points on it, the ears, the lower jaw with the pointy teeth, the claws on feet and paws, and the tip of the tail.  You can still tell it's a dragon.  But it's been trimmed so there are no more sharp points to poke a tender Boxer mouth, lol.  Oh, and still, after 8 1/2 years, she makes me laugh just about every day, just by being her own derpy self.  I will own this breed until I am too feeble to walk them safely.  Edit: Punc."
Boxer,2zymrf,Old_School_New_Age,2,Mon Mar 23 21:11:50 2015 UTC,"That was very insightful! It's true I do feel like Marina understands muh of what I say and she also tries to talk back to me which is so cute.   I grew up with Maltese's and I always craved the kind of fun-lovingness and devotion that I've only been able to find in Boxers.   I watch a Newfoundland puppy when her owner travels (which so far has been 2 months out of her 5 month life) and although she's super fluffy and cute and sweet, I'll never have another dog other than a boxer. http://imgur.com/3sRrXmd"

Here is troopers story  ""he was hit by a car and left in the shelter for 11 days with a broken leg with no real treatment. Due to his stray hold, legally no vetting was allowed to be done. We pulled him the minute his hold was up and rushed him to the vet. We had to wait an additional 7 days for surgery due to a horrible infection. After the infection was cleared, our vet operated. His leg required a rod and 7 pins to fix it. After 3 months they were removed and we were hoping the bone would hold. Sadly, the infection ate away at his bone and as soon as he started feeling better and running, the bone snapped.""

My boy is definitely embarrassed by the cone, and feels he can't do anything with it on. He just walks from room to room occasionally standing there for a couple minutes. He'll hover his face over his food/water thinking he can't reach when we can. And he keeps hitting the cone on things so he gets scared :("

Boxer,2yztjt,boxxerrebellion,1 point,Sat Mar 14 05:42:12 2015 UTC,Our boxer had a MCT removed from his ear/head 5 years ago.  We dropped him off at the vet thinking he would come home with just one ear but the vet was able to save it while still removing the tumor with enough margins.   Caught it early and he will be turning 11 in a few months. Good luck to you and your little Lila.

Boxer,2yso7q,letsgodevils123,6,Thu Mar 12 14:20:59 2015 UTC,"So you have a Boxer! Yeah! They are the most fun dogs in the world but as ""working breed"" dogs they were bred to think for themselves, which works out well for them but not so good for us sometimes!  If you look at the world through a Boxer's eyes you will see it as EVERYTHING is a play thing! EVERYTHING! They do not differentiate between a purchased toy and your couch...many longtime Boxer owners have destroyed couch stories. The best advice I can give you is to be really consistent with your training and reward him with high praise and a teeny biscuit each time he does what you want him to do. If he begins to be too rough with his toy say NO! and praise him when he stops...he'll learn.   When you are not at home, able to watch him, crate him with a hanging water bucket (put it on the floor of the crate and it is immediately tipped over) and give him a hard rubber chew toy. Don't make a big fuss, just ""In your crate!"" and toss a dog biscuit (can be teeny even) and let him chase it in, say good boy. Then just leave. Do not make a big deal out of it or it will stir up his emotions/anxiety. Many people leave the tv on for company. I have no idea if that really helps but I do it too. When you come home say ""Let's potty!"" and take him out to do so and then life is good.  As for walking and stopping...made me laugh! My first day of obedience with my Boxer she walked about 3 steps and refused to move. Nothing I could do so the instructor took her and gave her a command, which she resolutely ignored and he dragged her a couple of feet! Still nothing so I stood her up and he got a biscuit to bribe her which kind of worked. Mind you I walked her on a leash every day but in class she had a complete meltdown. I think it was too much for her to take in all at once. By the next class she had figured out what was going on and did beautifully.  Here's what I think happens with Boxers: they learn really quickly (some people think they are dumb but most are not) and then they figure they've already done this why do it again? Remember to laugh when this happens because otherwise it will drive you crazy!  I highly recommend a good obedience class for your boy and you and can only tell you that my first Boxer totally changed my life and made it so much better. Have had several at a time ever since.  Best of luck and remember lots of praise as Boxers are emotional saps...and lap dogs!"
Boxer,2yso7q,AliceA,3,Thu Mar 12 14:39:28 2015 UTC,"We live in an apartment...He had a very bad diarrhea problem for 2 months that made us take a break from training him, and just letting him relax. We tried a cage/fenced in pen...He destroyed it...like bent the metal. He doesn't like his cage...he has broken it also. He has also eaten through rubber toys."
Boxer,2yso7q,AliceA,3,Thu Mar 12 16:03:48 2015 UTC,This is typical of Boxers! They are/can be a handful until they settle in around 3 years of age! Well worth the struggle but they can drive you crazy.
Boxer,2yso7q,rigbone93,1 point,Thu Mar 12 17:33:54 2015 UTC,"I agree with Alice. They're a very high energy breed much like most working class dog breeds. Mine doesn't destroy anything but my lab/beagle mix is bad at destroying things. I got him a little rubber tire toy at petco and so far it's holding up well. Also, I found a pretty good link about trying to get your dog to stop chewing I'll link it here if I can find it.."
Boxer,2yso7q,rigbone93,1 point,Thu Mar 12 21:48:50 2015 UTC,"Sorry couldn't find the article.

Boxer,2yso7q,PikachuDruggy,1 point,Thu Mar 12 21:54:36 2015 UTC,"I lived in an apartment upon getting my Boxer. He's pretty laid back, so I suppose it could just be your dog? Whenever he became rowdy (quite often as a pup), we bribed him with treats to be good and do the right thing. After a few months, he became pretty used to the routine even without treats. Your dog also might have a bunch of pent up energy and might just want to burn it off by absolutely demolishing everything in sight. As I said, the dog itself matters a ton, especially the personalities Boxers as a breed can have."

There will be one moment when he/she will kind of settle, but considering it's a puppy yet, it's really common. I deal with this issue by using toys such as some kind of really strong rope but both my two boxers ""clicked"" when they grew a bit and stopped breaking every toy like there is no tomorrow. Just wait and keep the training!"

Boxer,2ydn0n,AliceA,1 point,Mon Mar 9 17:31:55 2015 UTC,"Oh yes, I was aware the breed was founded on those breeds.  This is just what I was told when I got Lucy.  Never questioned it.  Just happy to have found a Boxer in my price range as I was looking for an emotional support dog.  And thanks!"

Boxer,2yatp7,madmaninabox,1 point,Mon Mar 9 15:04:42 2015 UTC,I met a boxer named Bailey at my family reunion last year. Fell in love with her and that's what lead me to get my boxer :)

Boxer,2y8wf7,PolarBill,2,Sat Mar 7 18:58:43 2015 UTC,"MUST be a boxer thing. Mine does this as well, in the car, on the couch, in his bed. Weirdos."
Boxer,2y8wf7,burgerslave,2,Sun Mar 8 01:53:36 2015 UTC,Yep. Mine does too! My docked boxer never sat like this though. Could be a tail thing?

Boxer,2y8wf7,jderm11,1 point,Sat Mar 7 22:31:10 2015 UTC,I've seen boxers do this many times! Do you think it might have something to do with how prone they are to hip dysplasia?
Boxer,2y8wf7,happytrails1,1 point,Sun Mar 8 03:34:05 2015 UTC,Mine does the same when he's sitting on the couch. He likes the back support!
Boxer,2y8tnl,AliceA,1 point,Sat Mar 7 15:17:46 2015 UTC,Either moving around or on my pillow for a snooze! That's how he stays so handsome.

Boxer,2y6ybo,gamayogi,4,Sat Mar 7 04:31:29 2015 UTC,He's magnificent.
Boxer,2y6ybo,ratstack,3,Sat Mar 7 04:58:00 2015 UTC,My best friend. Always there when I need him. Wouldn't trade him for anything.
Boxer,2y6ybo,AmIPopularNow,2,Sun Mar 8 03:38:14 2015 UTC,Haha. That's not a walk. That's a protest.
Boxer,2y313x,Tsquared10,5,Fri Mar 6 00:23:25 2015 UTC,"Man, I have 2 boxers and my girlfriend's always kicking them off the couch or out of bed.  This face is incredibly common in our house."
Boxer,2y313x,DrCE,2,Fri Mar 6 01:46:46 2015 UTC,"Omg that face let him back in! That's exactly why my boys are so spoiled, I can't deal with the face!"
Boxer,2y24e3,Aj84,4,Thu Mar 5 20:18:00 2015 UTC,I bet that tail knocks things all over the place.
Boxer,2y24e3,DrCE,1 point,Fri Mar 6 01:17:50 2015 UTC,Gave the wife a black eye one time. She has learned a little more control with her tail now tho

Boxer,2y20sg,someguynamedg,1 point,Thu Mar 5 19:51:49 2015 UTC,"My girl is 65 pounds and I use the Easy Walk Harness on her. I think I got her a large, but I can't remember. I put it on her somewhat backwards (where the leash clips on at her chest, not on her back) to keep her from pulling so much. Works like a charm. They are adjustable, but I'm sure you could return 1 to petsmart if the first size you try doesn't fit.

Boxer,2xz7w8,Conner-aligor,1 point,Thu Mar 5 17:58:38 2015 UTC,She just crawled under the mattress topper while we were making the bed. Then her brother laid on top of her like a real jerk.

Boxer,2xs247,AliceA,1 point,Tue Mar 3 16:19:19 2015 UTC,Mine is easy to bathe but thats only because he just stands still and looks sad for the duration. He is super happy when he is done though and spends the next 15 minutes rubbing himself on the floor.
Boxer,2xs247,maniakb416,2,Tue Mar 3 20:12:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah, my dog was the same way.  You could tell he didn't like it, tail between his legs (well, nub) and a sad look.  But he held still and then ran around like a madman afterwards."
Boxer,2xs247,burts_beads,1 point,Tue Mar 3 23:00:18 2015 UTC,Mine hates the bath but loves running zoomies all over the house afterward!
