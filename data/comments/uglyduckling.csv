I have deep knowledge of gear and not because I think it is evil, rather I gained it when I was, ahem......gaining if you know what I mean. Just be very safe. I have a strong hunch I paid a price and now have to take therapeutic doses of my old favorite. Cypionate."
uglyduckling,3bznih,Jwats96,0,Sat Jul 4 04:35:05 2015 UTC,"Really? I can't stand this shit. People are always saying that others can't possibly be that big without gear. There were 3 years between the first and second pic. That's more than enough time to make the progress OP did. And he's big, but if he was on gear he would be massive."
uglyduckling,3bznih,bradfromearth,2,Wed Jul 15 23:31:08 2015 UTC,"First off you have far too many assumptions and based on what your saying it is safe to assume you don't know a whole lot about gear.  In the pictures he may be perfectly clean but that does not mean he was never on gear and he would not automatically be massive if he was. It would all depend on which specific drugs he was taking. have been there and done that. I once weighed 240 lbs and was rock solid. I was bloated on gear and while I was huge and strong I looked like a giant marshmallow. After I got off the gear I dropped down to 210 and looked like a greek God, Totally clean and stayed that way for years. And that was in less than 2 years.   I will give him credit because he did a great job and he looks fantastic. But it is not natural. You ask 50 guys who have years of experience with steroids and as long as they are all over the age of 30 100% of them would say the same thing I am."

Well, It's not. It's an umbrella term that can be used to describe a lot of things. Birth control are steroids. One of the most common anabolic steroids is testosterone, which can be used to gain mass OR get shredded, and does not give you a gut (which is a sign of Hgh use, as I've said) or make your tits sag like Arnold's. In my opinion, this dude at least did testosterone."
uglyduckling,3bznih,notforrealb,-1,Fri Jul 3 16:07:08 2015 UTC,"I'm talking about anabolic steroids, easily the most common ""get big"" steroids used. Maybe this guy did some T, even if he did, he's gonna need to bust his ass to get that big. It's not like you take it and getting big is easy. Besides, this dude had ~2 years to get fit. He looked in decent shape in his first picture. The transition from year 19 to year 21 isn't insane. It's hard work and dedication. No reason to assume he did roids when there's so sign of them."
uglyduckling,3bznih,ASassoNation,1 point,Fri Jul 3 17:53:38 2015 UTC,"Saggy tits, I don't know where that came from. Maybe gyno? But expanded belly comes from hgh + insulin, which not your typical roid user can afford."

It's the goddamn ""muh feels"" generation. Well, fuck your feels, learn to be rational instead. Acting on one's own initial emotional reponse is almost always a bad idea.

uglyduckling,3bib62,AndiRoo91,18,Mon Jun 29 18:33:59 2015 UTC,"I started out with 3-4 months of strictly cardio. Running around 3-5 miles a day or biking 8-12 miles a day. After getting down to around 180, I didn't have much muscle definition. So I started a 5 day body split  Mondays: Chest/Biceps  Tuesday: Shoulders/Triceps  Wednesday: Back  Thursday: Legs/Abs  Friday: I would try to hit whatever part of the body I wanted too, kind of a tune up before the weekend. Mostly Cardio/Abs/Arms  I started cooking my own meals, (Chicken, broccoli, rice, quinoa, protein shakes, healthier cereal and random fruit & vegetables) I have been eating mainly that for the past 8 months.  I cut out alcohol out of my diet as it was racking up with calories and then giving me munchies later in the night. I also decided to enter myself in my first half-marathon and the 3 months leading up to that, it really kept me motivated to stay healthy. I ended up running it in 1:38:49 (7:30 mile pace)  All in all, I made sure to workout almost daily, sometimes hit double days. No matter how many times I slipped up and ate pizza or ice cream, I made sure to get my ass back in the gym the next day and keep going.  The only Max I really know is my bench went from 150-220 in those 13 months. I hit chest quite often."

uglyduckling,3aswu2,beep41,24,Tue Jun 23 06:30:32 2015 UTC,"Question: What's your experience been with people positing the existence of ""Attractive  Redheads"" and ""Unattractive Redheads"" or the notion that Redheaded people are more prone to being unattractive but occasionally sometimes very attractive?  Have you ever heard the phrase ""You're cute for a redhead"" or some variation?  I'm only asking because I had a redheaded friend who thought it was inexcusably rude to say, on par with saying ""You're cute for a Black person"" or ""You're cute for an Indian."" Or positing that any other group of people were mostly irredeemably ugly but with a select few who were attractive.  I don't hold to this opinion mind you. I will say that my formal position on your personal transformation is this: Damn."

Wouldn't that leave me with uninhibited drive for what I desire? I would take what I want, relentlessly pursue, at any cost to others, what ever I would desire.

So the August before my junior year of high school, a light went off in my head and I realized I wanted to look better physically so I took up weightlifting. I dicked around for a month and adapted a more concrete plan afterwards which was still pretty abysmal because I focused mostly on arms. A few months into this 'transformation,' I joined my school's swimming team and started to do PHAT by Layne Norton; it's a routine I still adhere to to this day, albeit with a few minor changes. I don't follow the routine by heart; I'm actually quite shitty in that regard. I would regularly take days off here and there because I didn't want to be sore for a meet. Despite this, I made it a priority to get in the gym at least 3-4 days a week. I continued this routine of swimming and weightlifting throughout my senior year of high school; I'd bulk during the fall and winter and cut during the spring. Diet is the key factor in muscle growth and weight gain/loss and I spent countless nights and hours researching nutrition, workout routines and the like. It takes time, commitment and consistency to attain results. Just putting your best foot forwards and making an effort will take you one step closer to your desired physique. Nowadays, I row for my college (off-season right now) and that's much more rigorous and strenuous in my opinion so I usually double up with rowing in the morning and weightlifting in the afternoon and just eat a lot of food. I currently sit at 5'9, 175, 14% BF so I could afford to shave off a few pounds.  TLDR; Just make an effort to hit the gym or be active. Do research on nutrition, food, workout regimens (I suggest Starting Strength if you're new to weightlifting) and pay a lot of attention to your diet. This means poring through scientific articles, reputable Reddit threads, and books. Don't worry about how big your arms or chest are; proportion is key. Learn the compound lifts (powerlifts & Olympic lifts) and utilize those exercises the most. When you master your technique and attain a decent base of strength, feel free to move onto a new regimen, but at this point you should have a pretty sizable knowledge base about the subject. You will not look like a Greek God instantaneously so be realistic in your expectations. Remain consistent and never lose sight of your goal; it's entirely upon you to induce the change in your life. But don't let vanity consume you entirely; remember to also improve yourself intellectually and socially by nurturing your brain, opening up to new experiences and meeting new people. I find that trying to improve myself in every facet will translate into better results overall."

uglyduckling,37ucvw,tongue_kiss,-1,Sun May 31 02:15:05 2015 UTC,"Sorry, it only looks like you started using make-up to me, not sure why honest criticism is getting downvoted. Using make-up isn't enough for me to say there was a ""transformation""."
uglyduckling,37ucvw,Andthentherewasbacon,5,Sun May 31 01:51:07 2015 UTC,"That's fair enough and I think people are entitled to their opinion.  Personally I think that make-up and personal grooming is a huge part of a transition/transformation and it's not until I really started to learn how to dress, take care of my skin and actually put some eyebrows on that I noticed a measurable change in my life (with self-perception and how others treated me as well)"
uglyduckling,37ucvw,forrman17,4,Sun May 31 02:17:30 2015 UTC,Which is very hard to portray in 2 pictures you can imagine! I bet if you found more photos throughout the transition it may be even better received on the sub. Congratulations on your newfound self-image!
uglyduckling,37ucvw,tongue_kiss,1 point,Sun May 31 02:30:09 2015 UTC,Yeah that's true :)  I actually don't have many photos of my younger self (I found this one through my school's facebook page and cringed!) but that's definitely a good point.  I've shied away from cameras a lot in my life :P

uglyduckling,37ucvw,forrman17,-15,Sun May 31 02:41:33 2015 UTC,You've always been beautiful. It's a shame you only feel beautiful behind makeup
uglyduckling,37ucvw,tongue_kiss,15,Sat May 30 17:28:47 2015 UTC,"Makeup is nothing to be ashamed of. It helps people far more than whatever damage you think it's doing by helping people feel more secure and confident about themselves. You should really reconsider this comment, think about the fucking sub you're commenting in the first place. No one deserves to be patronized like that when all they're trying to do is show how they've grown over the years. I'm sure she doesn't care about your opposing view on the value of makeup, and rightfully so."

uglyduckling,36wbup,SorrowSixx,2,Tue May 26 15:01:43 2015 UTC,"I dunno. I always hated my teeth for one, but that's changed since I got braces. What's not really obvious in these photos is that I had a severe overbite, like literally as bad as can be categorized. Other than that I guess it was just comparing myself with everyone else. I was bullied for a long time in primary school and for the first few years of secondary due mostly to the fact that I was never sporty or anything, and seeing everyone else really fit and active while I was skinny and pudgy affected me. That kinda bore down on me I guess.   So yeah, that'd be why I guess"

uglyduckling,36sodx,long_live_mcqueen,2,Thu May 21 22:13:09 2015 UTC,Between the ages 14-15 I put on quite a bit of weight. The photo shows towards the end of my weight loss. I don't have any photos of myself from when I was larger than that because I got rid of them all

uglyduckling,36kduw,BatmanMcladswag,3,Wed May 20 12:11:10 2015 UTC,Omg lmao
uglyduckling,36kduw,BigGreasyGil,4,Wed May 20 16:26:11 2015 UTC,"I second what /u/lex917 says. I'm curious though- was the weight loss from the process of maturing or did you diet to bring it down? If so, what did you do?"
uglyduckling,36kduw,BigGreasyGil,9,Wed May 20 03:48:08 2015 UTC,"was the weight loss from the process of maturing or did you diet to bring it down? If so, what did you do?   I think it was partly me just growing into my body. But a lot of my weight loss and muscle building had to do with the fact I picked up horseback riding as a hobby and now I'm an amateure athlete riding 9 times a week. When I initially lost weight when I was 14 it was from an eating disorder. The initial weight loss from when I was 19/20 was an eating disorder relapse. However I had a reality check when I passed out after riding a horse (due to lack of food + overexertion). I immediately sought therapy and found a nutritionist who helped me create a diet that catered to my highly active lifestyle. After seeing the nutritionist I had an extremely healthy diet and was still able to lose weight and maintain all the weight I lost through the disordered behaviours. I state I was at my lowest weight in one of my pictures, but to clarify, I was never underweight. I successfully overcame an eating disorder and couldn't be happier."
uglyduckling,36kduw,dispo916,3,Wed May 20 03:55:17 2015 UTC,That's awesome! Thanks for sharing your story. The fact that you overcame your obstacles makes the end result even better!
uglyduckling,36kduw,lex917,3,Wed May 20 03:59:28 2015 UTC,Good for u I'm really happy u sought help. Also u are gorgeous
uglyduckling,36kduw,RoyallyTenenbaumed,4,Wed May 20 05:11:32 2015 UTC,"After seeing the nutritionist I had a basic dietary plan to follow, that I still follow to this day. In the morning, I make a fruit smoothie with whatever fruit I wanted, either almond milk or kefir and a scoop of protein powder. I also have either an egg white omelet with low carb bread or a cup of lowfat vanilla yoghurt with a quarter cup of granola and half a cup of fruit.   Between breakfast and lunch I usually have a snack like raw veggies or a handful of nuts.   For lunch I generally have a deli sliced chicken sandwich, pretzels or pita chips and fruit (usually grapes or blueberries).   Between lunch and dinner I'll usually have something like a Luna bar or a balance bar.   My dinner is typically more carb loaded than my other meals (not sure why my nutritionist had me do that). I'll usually have chicken with a carb (rice or pasta) and a vegetable. One of my favourite things to make is sausage, pepper, onion pasta. I usually will buy a variation of spicy chicken sausage. I always make sure there's double the amount of protein over the carb in whatever dish I make.   Keep in mind, this type of diet is more for weight maintenance/for an athlete."

The Simpsons did that same joke with Apu's last name, and it's also a shitty joke there. Is this something that's appropriate to say to someone you think is hot and also Indian in person?

uglyduckling,36c42t,PokefanErick,1 point,Mon May 18 19:15:21 2015 UTC,"Well fashion is different for every body. What I think looks good and what others think looks good has too many variables to give a definitive answer to what looks THE BESTEST EVAR on every one else. For example I tend to like to dress in an attire that fits into the category of business casual because I want to grow up to be a scientist or a professional artist someday and I want people to take me seriously and treat me with respect, but that I also don't like things to be not too formal and boring. I like wearing clothes that are vibrant, colorful, and often times I like to wear one garment with a simple or complex patterns (EX. a tie or shirt with plaid, polka dots, squares, tiny roses, or tiny doves on them) because I simply have always been in love with colors and designs because of my life long fascination with art and I feel they make me look, young, joyful, and chock full of vigor. I have a chain wallet I always wear, dye my hair funny colors, I have a Mohawk that I like to part on the right hand side of my head and comb the rest of my hair to the left,  and will on occasion wear vests I made out of old dress shirts that tore because I was a punk growing up and still identify as one. I am Latino and was raised in the mid-west and like to wear cowboy boots and Cowboy hats from time to time. I like to think that my fashion style will change as time passes, new trends form and pass, and I grow older and older as will everyone else but my personal style will just incorporate what's trending with my own unique flair that in of itself will change maybe I'll end up being a Chemist and have to go to meeting and conferences and people reject my findings or research just because I have a Mohawk or get my pitch for a cartoon to Cartoon Network,Nick,Disney,etc. shot down because I didn't dress formal enough. I only meant to give OP a tip because I sometimes feel like if I had followed fashion trends or tried something new things might be different."

uglyduckling,36c42t,WastingOurYouth,6,Tue May 19 10:30:04 2015 UTC,"Not all of us want to 'pop out more', some of us just wear what's comfortable."
uglyduckling,36c42t,Tainted_Bruh,3,Mon May 18 13:21:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah...I'm no pagan goth, but this recent trend of looking like a bowl of skittles leaves me a little mystified, especially when i visit MFA.   Or maybe the young fella with the red chinos, lime-green polo, and cream loafers is too hip for an old fogey like me."
uglyduckling,36c42t,PokefanErick,1 point,Tue May 19 04:17:58 2015 UTC,You don't have to sacrifice comfort to look nice and stand out. I understand what it's like to struggle with body issues I was the fat kid growing up and I always tried to hide my body by wearing clothes that were larger and much more roomy and comfortable and it was all well and good when that was the trend but then clothes went back to fitting right and I just stayed looking the same. I eased my self into fashion for a long time little by little and now I dress in a way that complements my figure instead of hiding it and looking bigger in the process. I also started working out and have lost a lot of weight my self confidence is through the roof now.
uglyduckling,36c42t,Hipstermankey,1 point,Wed May 20 13:35:38 2015 UTC,Well the only things I saw them recommend therewere super expensive (or I've seen the wrong posts) so for me it was kind of useless because not everyone can spend a fortune on clothes :/ But yeah like I said maybe I just saw the wrong posts
uglyduckling,36c42t,PokefanErick,2,Mon May 18 13:46:34 2015 UTC,You just need to learn how to shop correctly! If money is an issue try shopping at off-price department stores such as Ross or Marshalls they get the same merchandise a more upscale department store has but like 50%-80% off here's how they do it!
uglyduckling,36c42t,Hipstermankey,1 point,Wed May 20 14:06:13 2015 UTC,Wow I really thought I might get angry responses but thank you very much! :) I just don't think I will be able to go to a Roos or a Marshalls store since I don't think they have stores here in my country
uglyduckling,36c42t,PokefanErick,2,Wed May 20 14:23:28 2015 UTC,"Then my other tips are to buy online (from local designers and manufactures they'll usually give locals a good deal plus shipping is much cheaper or can be picked up at a shop in your area) or if the page has a discount code system in place (most do) search around online for coupons, another good way to get deals online is subscribe to a fashion blog, forum,and/or a designer/stores newsletter (it'll also let you know what's trending if your into that or not and some even have special coupons for clothing shops from time to time) preferably one from your country so that you get a better sense of what's trending in your country, another good tip is to start talking to other people you know about clothing and fashion (it's a good way to hunt down good shops, designers, and/or sales) since everyone wears clothes, likes to look good, and being told they look good it's a good topic to talk about even with a complete stranger (especially the ladies), if you are talking to a stranger try keeping your remarks positive you don't want to say things like ""I like your shoes do they come in a better color"" and keep complements from being sexual to help keep others from misinterpreting your comments (ex. ""I like your skirt girl it makes you look sexy as hell!""), use words like cool, cute, or trendy and not words like sexy, making your body part look like x, or hot, also look up stores online to find out what their primary customer base is (low,medium, or high end shops have varying pricing ranges) and find out what shops are partnered with them to sell their over stocked, out of season clothing, and/or defective and returned merchandise (these are those off-priced shops I was talking to you about), and lastly always buy your clothes outfit by outfit and try on every piece of clothing (for ex. buy an outfit for your favorite pair of casual sneakers) instead of piece by piece so that you know every article fits, that you like it enough to wear it regularly, and you buy something that has a purpose.   other tips: go to a tailor and get your measurements given to you and ask them what they recommend your size be xs,s,m,l,xl for shirts and 38/32, 36/30,etc. for the size of pants in waist and length of pant leg so that you can shop online or find stuff in shop much more easily and accurately, keep in mind every style and garment cut will fit differently and look differently, think about clothing as a necessity not a luxury treat it with respect and don't be afraid of spending a bit more on things if they'll last you longer and make you feel comfortable and confident, don't afraid to look up a review or two to see how good or bad a specific brand is everyone of them his it's strengths and weaknesses, and lastly have fun when you go shopping to keep it from feeling like a chore when you go shopping."

It was great that you did eventually grow out hair XD hopefully like yours, I would be able to grow back some of what i have lost. I understand what you mean about ""you never knowing when you may lose it"". You should definitely take full advantage of it now. You should share your story more so people with Alopecia do not lose hope and do not give up! It is truly inspiring.

uglyduckling,35j1lw,Odins-raven,2,Mon May 11 05:36:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah it killed my confidence. Thats all i thought people were thinking when talking to me, how disgusting my skin was. Going on roaccutane changes your life!"
uglyduckling,35j1lw,geekygirl23,1 point,Mon May 11 21:00:10 2015 UTC,"Yup, same here.  I was constantly thinking about how my face looked 24/7.  Yeah accutane is amazing although the side effects are prettyyy gnarly."
uglyduckling,35j1lw,jasminkkpp,2,Tue May 12 02:16:18 2015 UTC,Yeah i left alot of skin behind everywhere haha and copped a savage sunburn with blisters. But well and truely worth it!
uglyduckling,35j1lw,fg33473r2d2,14,Tue May 12 10:11:52 2015 UTC,Very nice and a good attitude to have.
uglyduckling,35j1lw,zodberg,2,Sun May 10 22:20:05 2015 UTC,"Thanks!  I had to find something positive to hold onto or else I probably would've let the low self esteem consume me, and I didn't want to succumb to the idea that I didn't live up to society's expectations of beauty."
uglyduckling,35j1lw,unravellingmagic,4,Mon May 11 05:33:46 2015 UTC,"Wow, how did you make the acne go away?"
uglyduckling,35j1lw,Earthbounded,3,Mon May 11 00:27:46 2015 UTC,Accutane & drinking lots of water.
uglyduckling,35j1lw,23AndLifesBeenHard,3,Mon May 11 05:50:33 2015 UTC,You look great now! Were you by any chance bullied growing up?
uglyduckling,35j1lw,thirddayiii,9,Sun May 10 22:52:04 2015 UTC,"Thank you!  I wasn't at all from 1st-8th grade, but I think that was because I went to a really small private school with kids that I had basically grown up with.  But I was bullied a little my 1st and 2nd years of high school.  I had acne probably starting around 6th grade, but it got really terrible when I was 15/16 years old.    Kids in high school would just comment on how red my face was or would ask why I didn't try to get rid of it (like uhh don't you think I've tried everything?!).  This one kid would literally screw his face up when I would talk to him and he told me once that everyone in his lab group was talking about me and why my face was so red and puffy.  But honestly in the grand scheme of bullying, I would say I was never bullied to an extent that made me feel shitter than I already made myself feel, ya know?  Or at least I just never let it affect me that much."

uglyduckling,35j1lw,TornCondom,2,Mon May 11 05:51:27 2015 UTC,Seeing how wonderfully good looking your skin became after it was so bad gives me hope. I'm currently in a phase where the redness and overall bad condition of my skin is killing my self esteem. Trying to keep my hopes up that one day my skin will be as beautiful as yours!
uglyduckling,35j1lw,rhonx2,1 point,Mon May 11 10:14:25 2015 UTC,"Keep your head up!  It'll go away eventually - there are so many options out there for acne and everyones skin reacts differently to each kind of medicine, but one will work for you.  Just keep telling yourself that the acne won't last forever!!  You'll kick it in the ass.  And don't let anyone bring you down, because you're better than them, and they just wanna tear you down to make themselves feel better."

uglyduckling,32eb9x,LeyTimTV,20,Mon Apr 13 02:15:08 2015 UTC,My parents had the same concerns but when we got a conseltation the doctor explained that 15 is a good age for a nose job. This is due to the fact that at 15 the face is for the most part done growing and the bone is still young enough for a speedy recovery. In fact the after picture was only taken 2 weeks after the surgery and by then I had no bruising whatsoever and my nose was only slightly sensative. Thanks for your concern!
uglyduckling,32eb9x,monk3ytheboy,13,Mon Apr 13 04:36:52 2015 UTC,I'm going to throw my hat in against plastic surgery before puberty ends. I'm glad you're happy but it still seems irresponsible to do something like that to your child. I know you say your doctor said it was fine but you can't deny he has a potential conflict of interest in suggesting you go ahead and do it.
uglyduckling,32eb9x,tearsinthesea,4,Mon Apr 13 04:50:16 2015 UTC,"Yeah, if anything he should have waited till his later years"
uglyduckling,32eb9x,phukhugh,5,Mon Apr 13 13:33:17 2015 UTC,"Not to be rude, but being honest, they made your nose quite literally the opposite, doing a slight ""slope"" now. I know you consulted with a doctor, but my nose has changed dramatically since I was 16, being 21 now. I would have waited and talked with a different doctor for a second opinion mate."
uglyduckling,32eb9x,Earthbounded,34,Mon Apr 13 14:25:57 2015 UTC,"in response to that, it seems like he's very happy and satisfied with the procedure, and consulted a physician and made the decision with his parents. even if his nose shape would have changed as he got older, the surgery is in the past and he's happy with his appearance, so i don't really see an issue here.   I do see the merit in your comment for those who may be reading the thread and are contemplating a rhinoplasty, but for OP's case, it seems to be an ideal operation!"
uglyduckling,32eb9x,phukhugh,3,Mon Apr 13 06:06:24 2015 UTC,"Very true, but I do know that most people ""grow into"" their faces and most of the men on uglyduckling who have more of a hump on their nose typically pull it off when they settle into it in the after photos, although it's not my decision and like you said, OP is happy with the results, just a matter of opinion."
uglyduckling,32eb9x,iluvmypups,2,Mon Apr 13 06:35:13 2015 UTC,I hope you have a happy teen hood. you seem really happy after your nose job.   Are you open to getting a 35 year old woman's opinion on noses?    Edit: I can't spell
uglyduckling,32eb9x,coldvault,0,Mon Apr 13 06:45:45 2015 UTC,"Totally relevant anecdote time! I remember when I was in high school and one of my classmates got a nose job. He said it was because it was broken or he had a deviated septum or something, but he was such an obnoxious douche that we all made fun of him for it (because, as high schoolers, we were all obnoxious douches in our own ways).  What I'm trying to say is that I hope your peers like you enough to not bully you about your nose, before or after the rhinoplasty. Not being a homophobe helps."

uglyduckling,32622g,chantistar,6,Sat Apr 11 00:41:57 2015 UTC,can you or anyone say what causes a child to suffer from this? i assume something in their life causes them to find relief in some way from doing this to themselves.
uglyduckling,32622g,chantistar,8,Sat Apr 11 02:29:21 2015 UTC,"It's hard to explain, exactly. It just feels really satisfying to pull (for me it's my eyelashes and eyebrows.) Of course, I hate myself afterwards, but it feels good while I'm doing it.  I often find myself pulling unconsciously when I'm stressed, so it could be related to stress relief or something."
uglyduckling,32622g,freckledcupcake,7,Sat Apr 11 04:33:57 2015 UTC,"I know mine happened around the time my parents were divorcing. I always chalked it up to that. And then bullying in school.

uglyduckling,32622g,nubbie,4,Sat Apr 11 03:03:56 2015 UTC,I know mine is directly related to my stress level. And then I just get stressed over that so I pull more and its a vicious cycle

I'm glad everyone shared their opinion, but I am not lying when I assure you that I posted originally to show what I thought was an important transfortmation for me. If I wanted easy attention, I believe there are other subs I could have posted to like r/amiugly, r/amipretty, etc. (in which case I wouldn't even have to share my embarassing--to me--old pictures). However, I don't want to know those things (I am confident in myself now and I have no need to validate it), I just wanted to share the way my life and appearance has changed over time, going from insecure to not.   I am honestly shocked by the reaction this has received, because I do genuinely believe (and also was taught to believe by my peers) that I was an ugly kid, which is why I worked so hard to change my appearance when I hit high school. Though people are legitimately angry that it wasn't enough of a transformation, it has been equally hard for me to hear that all those years of self doubt were wrong, since I can't go back and be nicer to myself or raise my confidence during those years (I just feel terrible for how I treated myself honestly).   I'm new to this sub so I know my opinion doesn't hold much weight, but I wish people would be less angry about this for me and future posters. It's fine to share that you think I was never ugly and I understand that you are trying to be nice and I appreciate that, but I don't see the need to attack my character (saying I'm just here for attention), since you don't know actually know me or my motives and it's quite hurtful and discouraging.   Finally, on the boobs, since that's also an issue, I can finally say that, yes, I look good in a bikini! For years I was really self conscious about that as well, because my girl friends would often tell me that guys were only interested in me because of my chest, which made me even more self conscious about my face and general appearance. I understand where everyone is coming from, but I just wanted to make these things clear, so hopefully there isn't so much animosity in the future before knowing where the poster is coming from...   Thanks for all your comments, regardless, they have been interesting for me to read!  :)  EDIT: Oh my god, sorry for the length... that was wayy longer than I expected. Just a conscious stream of thought, definitely should have edited..."

I went through some hard years where I was really self conscious of the way I looked and have been sorting out the way I look and my self confidence ever since. I think lots of people can relate to the feeling of transformation for the better, so I don't see the harm in wanting to share it. Everyones entitled to their own opinion so you can downvote and others can chose for themselves if they'd like to upvote or downvote!  Edit: if this is a problem, and people feel like other posts aren't getting enough attention, I will happily delete this. I'm proud of my changes but I don't want to cause problems for other posters!"
uglyduckling,30aq23,JosephBalin,27,Thu Mar 26 02:44:23 2015 UTC,"1) Every subbreddit likes ""sticking"" to its designed purpose. /r/uglyduckling is no different. This place tends to get a bit callous on these subjects so don't mind the upvotes on posts like the one above.  2) You're a very attractive girl and it might be hard for others to understand that you went through hard years. I think that's a given as a human. We are never quite satisfied with what we have especially at a young and naive age. Just keep doing you and don't delete the post."
uglyduckling,30aq23,DowntownSecrets,3,Wed Mar 25 22:42:39 2015 UTC,"I want to touch on comment 2.  There are always people in nearly every post that complain about someone not truly being ugly as a kid. Who quantifies this? I don't understand how you can reasonably tell someone that was bullied, made fun of ect not to post here because you don't think they were ugly enough as a kid.   A lot of people say it's because OPs look for attention when we allow this, but who's going to distinguish between which OPs are just looking for attention vs which actually had insecurities as a kid? It's bullshit and unless we have some sort of ugly police rolling around it's not even possible to enforce the rules. Ignoring that point even, who cares if someone is looking for a little bit of attention? Aren't we all? This sub is literally based around that fact. Who cares. Get over it."
uglyduckling,30aq23,JosephBalin,2,Wed Mar 25 23:07:13 2015 UTC,"I've commented this same thing in the past, and I wouldn't be surprised if the people rallying against these sort of posts were less attractive than the poster.   It feels like a lot of the commenters here lack the ability to put themselves into another person's shoes and try to understand why they may feel a certain way.   On the flip side, there's posts on here with really underwhelming transformations, and you don't see any comments with 100 upvotes on those posts telling them that they're still an ugly duckling.   This isn't a gigantic sub, if only the most extreme changes were approved to be posted then there'd be fuck all content. People need to get over the fact that others can feel unattractive without looking like Susan Boyle."

I was bullied relentlessly-- I was the butt of mean jokes, dares, and people talked about how hideous I was, often loud enough for me to hear. I suppose attractiveness is a very subjective thing though, and maybe I would have had a more normal experience if more people like you went to my high school! I do think there is a big enough difference though, considering how there were even some relatives that didn't recognize me. Thanks for the compliment though! :)"

They forget the years that you've spent living with yourself trying to improve. Even just from the pictures you can see that it's more than just a bit of makeup and taking the glasses off. It's doing these things well which make you standout.   So many people in here underestimate the effort it takes to do this sort of thing. You don't suddenly wake up one day and just decide to put some makeup on, do your hair nicely, dress up and take your glasses off. It takes lots of tweaking to figure out what works for you."

I had never been anywhere close to obese, but I was awkwardly tall for my age (I was nicknamed Big Foot) and stuff like this gave me the worst body image issues.

But I am a loner these days and have a hard time making friends because if it. But kids are just assholes. I dont know what drives them to be so cruel? I never went around making fun of people. I just kept to myself.  But I can definitely tell you, you weren't ugly as a kid. You looked normal.

uglyduckling,2zw0lo,IStillWork,-2,Sun Mar 22 09:34:49 2015 UTC,I thought i was an ugly duckling.
uglyduckling,2zlscg,beccyftw,21,Thu Mar 19 17:25:43 2015 UTC,"Yet you look 17 in both. Though, I wouldnt say you were much of an ugly duckling.  Youve gotta be ugly to start for that"
uglyduckling,2zlscg,Kindly_PM_your_boobs,5,Thu Mar 19 20:25:29 2015 UTC,I have to agree  with  you. I wouldn't  mind looking  like her from either picture.
uglyduckling,2zlscg,grandteton,-17,Thu Mar 19 23:19:21 2015 UTC,"Oh come on, stop white knighting if you are. She went from unattractive to attractive. Her change from 17 to 22 is great."
uglyduckling,2zlscg,HallowSingh,9,Thu Mar 19 21:26:22 2015 UTC,"I hate that term. Clearly, she got more attractive. However, I wouldnt call her 14 picture ugly. A little awkward, yeah, but a I just dont think it qualifies as ugly. Mildly attractive to pretty darn attractive isnt really ugly duckling,  its just... self improvement. Admirable still, though."
uglyduckling,2zlscg,Kindly_PM_your_boobs,-4,Thu Mar 19 21:35:52 2015 UTC,Yeah i didn't mean to call her ugly but it is a huge improvement. I didn't even say she was ugly
uglyduckling,2zlscg,HallowSingh,11,Thu Mar 19 21:47:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but you argued with me and accused ne of white knighting when I said she wasnt. Unnecessary drama, man."
uglyduckling,2zlscg,Kindly_PM_your_boobs,-5,Thu Mar 19 22:49:42 2015 UTC,"Sorry i must have interpreted your comment wrongly. My understanding was by you saying she's not ugly you were complimenting her saying she was good looking (14), and she is now (22) which is understandable; but, saying that with the intentions of hoping you could win her over by being nice if you get what I mean. It just seemed like you were sugar coating and that's a personal pet peeve of mine, sorry."
uglyduckling,2zlscg,HallowSingh,6,Thu Mar 19 22:59:59 2015 UTC,People can't give out compliments without an ulterior motive?

uglyduckling,2zlscg,am00sed,-8,Thu Mar 19 22:13:53 2015 UTC,Correction: she went from unattractive to unattractive; with boobs
uglyduckling,2zlscg,Akitador,3,Thu Mar 19 23:51:22 2015 UTC,you look adorable!

uglyduckling,2zkxu1,beccyftw,-13,Thu Mar 19 17:36:19 2015 UTC,But he said he took ONE gap year. Which means it took him seven.

uglyduckling,2zkxu1,grobend,5,Sat Apr 4 15:09:56 2015 UTC,"OP- I didn't, it only took me 4 1/2 years to complete it. Started in 2010 and finished mid-2014 (after failing a subject one semester it pushed me back a bit). But because I finished mid year I had to wait until March 2015 for my graduation ceremony (don't know why they hold it then lol)."

uglyduckling,2yzjfb,righteous-bucks,15,Sat Mar 14 13:28:55 2015 UTC,In that last pic you remind me of Turk in scrubs whenever they flash back to him in college

uglyduckling,2yzjfb,hattu,5,Sat Mar 14 04:42:49 2015 UTC,I came here to say this too!   OP has an amazing smile :)
uglyduckling,2yzjfb,hattu,23,Sat Mar 14 07:40:46 2015 UTC,Keep your eyebrows in check and lose the neckbeard and mustache

uglyduckling,2yzjfb,prematurememoir,4,Sat Mar 14 13:12:38 2015 UTC,you look somewhat like Turk from Scrubs
uglyduckling,2yzjfb,The_Holy_Yost,3,Sat Mar 14 13:19:55 2015 UTC,Posting to tell you that I love the last picture! You look so happy!

uglyduckling,2yr19v,hellya,3,Thu Mar 12 17:22:23 2015 UTC,I shaved half of my eyebrow off at a party for some reason or another.
uglyduckling,2yr19v,backbitting,5,Sun Mar 15 13:00:42 2015 UTC,HEY looks great. also have you considered a beard or scruff? might add an edgey look. you look very wholesome.

uglyduckling,2ygqvp,ThatGuyNamedElliot,3,Mon Mar 9 20:33:05 2015 UTC,People don't realise that diet is the key to any weight loss. I used to be very lazy and constantly ate out. All I did was cut my portions down by counting calories without eating out too often and did cardio at the gym. I'm now looking to build muscle and looking into weight training programmes
uglyduckling,2ygqvp,Confuzzled11820,1 point,Mon Mar 9 20:45:42 2015 UTC,"Exact same story here. I was super lazy and overate all the time. At the beginning of the school year all I did was cut down my portion sizes and currently I have lost ~35 lbs! I still have a bit of a gut, but definitely better than before. It is surprising how much you lose through portion control. You look great man, keep it up!  Did you know that all the weight you lose is literally breathed out of you as CO2? I was honestly shocked when I heard that!"
uglyduckling,2ygqvp,i_duca,2,Tue Mar 10 01:27:18 2015 UTC,You look fabulous now. I'm proud of you stranger !

uglyduckling,2y3cgr,TheRealChizz,2,Fri Mar 6 05:22:32 2015 UTC,6 Feet tall exactly. And I can't wait for that day! It's coming faster then I used to think it would.

uglyduckling,2y3cgr,kendallyeah,3,Fri Mar 6 05:51:24 2015 UTC,You look much better now! Things can only get better from here. Also I'm not sure if it was the picture but do you have 2 different colored eyes?
uglyduckling,2y3cgr,kendallyeah,2,Fri Mar 6 04:18:59 2015 UTC,"I do actually! It's hard to notice usually, one's gray and the other's blue. I think it's only noticeable if the blue eye has a glare or sun on it like it does in the picture with the Just Do It shirt."
uglyduckling,2y3cgr,farkenell,2,Fri Mar 6 05:03:57 2015 UTC,That is really fucking cool.

I love this so much.  Great job love. you're very pretty now but even more importantly you learned from all your mistakes and you're continuing to work on the dysmorphia.  I struggle with the same thing.  No matter how handsome strangers will tell me I am I just can't see it."
uglyduckling,2xzy98,Kirchyking,3,Thu Mar 5 18:27:44 2015 UTC,"I think that's the biggest thing I'm grateful for, that it's made me a better judge of character and made me judge others less quickly. I don't know if we'll ever look in the mirror and say 'dang I am on fire' haha, but I definitely think the compliments become a little easier to take and believe over time. Would love to see your transformation!"

uglyduckling,2xhnll,Flightless_Ferret,16,Sat Feb 28 23:05:10 2015 UTC,I need to get my hands on some of that makeup Matthew Lewis and Joe Manganiello used!
uglyduckling,2xhnll,Flightless_Ferret,14,Sat Feb 28 23:47:06 2015 UTC,"I like to imagine Matthew Lewis is still that same kid in his mind's eye.  A bit unaware of his current self, his image still not fully recovered by Emma ignoring his little advances.  Self esteem not fully recovered and in line with his current self.  He looks in the mirror and still finds himself surprised every time: ""Woah, I'm hot? This is me? But I didn't think I'd get to be hot..."" then when he goes out in public, cracks a smile, and thinks to himself, ""Oh yeah, I'm hot now...bet you didn't see that coming world"".  Then as the night goes on he starts to forget he's so handsome and is a little stunned when women who are pretty enough to make him nervous approach him.  Self esteem isn't low, but he thinks to himself ""Wouldn't you rather talk to Rupert? I bet she's just settling"".  I understand you Matthew, I understand..."

Completely agree Kerry Washington was very amazing the entire time"
uglyduckling,2xhnll,Gummibehrs,4,Sun Mar 1 04:13:07 2015 UTC,"I promise I don't mean anything by it, I think you're mistaking my intentions. I absolutely agree, Kerry does look incredible in her before picture, and it's apparently impossible for Brad Pitt to take a bad picture. The best I could find on the two of them was a picture of young Kerry Washington in a denim jacket and two pictures of Brad Pitt with funny hairstyles. All I was doing was showing that celebrities change too. They weren't just born the super well-adjusted and amazing people they are today, they had awkward phases too."

I do realize that some of these pictures (as /u/obligatorysomething pointed out) were actually taken when the actors or actresses were in character, and so are not true transformations. If any of you find pictures of the celebrities in this post that more appropriately show their transformations, please, feel free to reply with a link and I'll add it to the album. Also, some of the celebrities look much better in their ""before"" pictures than I could on my best day. Besides that, I encourage you to have fun looking at the beautiful people we see today vs the kids they were before. I understand if you don't appreciate this post, and if that's the case you have my sincerest apologies (really, truly, honestly sorry). But I hope that you'll like it for what it is and I wish all of you a great day! Thank you!

I'm sure you are already aware of this, and would do no such thing to put this identity in jeopardy. You're a nice girl, if my memory serves me correctly.  You are also quite intelligent; it would be smart not to question the abilities of a redditor in fear of having to change his username to /u/deleted.  Long time no see, by the way!

I ended up really REALLY pleased with the results, but man it was nerve racking the entire time.  If you need any advice, send me a message."

As I've grown up I've realized that the type of people with that style generally (not always) have personality traits that make them less attractive which is a big reason why I don't find it very good looking anymore, but some people can really pull it off."

uglyduckling,2wcdgu,nauree,1 point,Wed Feb 18 21:25:22 2015 UTC,"thats an annoying trend on here for sure, but I really wouldn't call this a case of it. I definitely thought she looked like a very disproportioned and homely little kid in the first photo. This feels so mean and backwards to defend someone by calling them ugly lol. but her huge teeth and invisible eyebrows were a very awkward combination. You can see how her face really proportioned out a LOT more than I expected it to. I think she's beautiful now but that's irrelevant. The point is she looked odd as a kid and normal now."

uglyduckling,2vp50o,bloodyhaze,-10,Fri Feb 13 16:10:58 2015 UTC,"Thank you! :)  Yeah, I'm from a country where basically every teenager drinks and smokes, but I'm definitely not planning on continuing forever. Enjoying it right now, though :)"
uglyduckling,2vl1qe,dragoness_leclerq,47,Wed Feb 11 22:10:10 2015 UTC,"Amazing transformation.  Did you keep the same friends?  Oh, and shout out from Scottsdale."
uglyduckling,2vl1qe,Warlizard,38,Wed Feb 11 22:57:35 2015 UTC,"Wait, are you from the Warlizard ga... Nah, I'm fucking with you. Thank you! As far as whether I kept the same friends? Eh, I had very few to begin with but once I started losing weight things got a bit complicated. Made lots of new ones though!"
uglyduckling,2vl1qe,Warlizard,26,Wed Feb 11 23:00:29 2015 UTC,"That's cold...  ಠ_ಠ  I'm not surprised though, I kinda figured.  Did your old friends stop accepting you or did you not accept them after you decided to change?"
uglyduckling,2vl1qe,PRGrl718,56,Wed Feb 11 23:02:36 2015 UTC,"Both really. I never made some kind of public ""I'm going to get fit!"" declaration or anything and it happened fairly quickly so it kind of blindsided them. Things got messy.   My ""role"" in our little group was that of the classic 'fat friend'. I.e. bottom rung, no competition, butt of all jokes and eager to please, etc.   They started off supportive but honestly, I think it was assumed I would fail eventually. When I didn't and kept going they stopped being so supportive. Accusing me of drug abuse, etc. Power dynamics shifted and all that. Plus I was getting attention and more confident and thus ""competition"". It was toxic all around."
uglyduckling,2vl1qe,Warlizard,47,Wed Feb 11 23:31:04 2015 UTC,"Wow, fuck people like them. Good on you for doing you, you look great."
uglyduckling,2vl1qe,CryHav0c,16,Thu Feb 12 00:02:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's the way it is. Your friendship is dependent on your role and once you're out of it...   Anyway, fuck 'em. You're happy now and that's what counts."
uglyduckling,2vl1qe,TaylorS1986,10,Thu Feb 12 00:55:21 2015 UTC,That's horrible...  Good thing you're rid of them.
uglyduckling,2vl1qe,CR00KS,3,Thu Feb 12 01:28:58 2015 UTC,"Wow. Just, wow.   If one of my friends lost a lot of weight I'd be ecstatic for them. I'd invite them along with me on runs or head to the gym with them to push each other.   I can't believe people can be so small with someone they supposedly care about.   You look great, btw.

Thank you. You've done amazing for yourself and you deserve to feel great pride everyday! I think you were beautiful to begin with, though."
uglyduckling,2vl1qe,sweetnwild,6,Thu Feb 12 09:53:40 2015 UTC,"Wow, that's really incredible to hear and you're welcome.  The struggling with diet is a feel I know all too well. Sometimes looking at 'transformation' pictures of regular people like the ones in this sub was the single most effective motivation tool. Often times it was the ONLY one; because it was something real, tangible.  Better than any mantra or trite platitude or wishful thinking. Just actually seeing that it was possible and that it all pays off in the end made determined to reach my goals.   Anyway, I really do appreciate your kind words <3."

uglyduckling,2vl1qe,ThatGuyNamedElliot,2,Thu Feb 12 14:48:27 2015 UTC,Are you serious!? You must still be in your teens then cause Linkin Park was the battle cry of my pre and early teen years as it was for most other angsty girls I knew.

Eventually I picked up the pace, working out, eating healthier, dressing nicer. In the end, what was detrimental for my success was that it was gradual and that I always got back up on the horse."

uglyduckling,2tcfiv,Flightless_Ferret,17,Fri Jan 23 03:45:03 2015 UTC,"Definitely incredible. We've been friends for 15 years, and we were super close. In middle school people (like my uncle) would assume she was a dude and my boyfriend because we hung out all the time.   A switch of clothes, hairstyle, and puberty can really change things up! I just wish she was taller, then I could steal jeans from her, but she's like 5'2"" and super petite so I just look like I'm wearing children's clothing."
uglyduckling,2tcfiv,Tattycakes,5,Fri Jan 23 03:49:32 2015 UTC,"The jawline looks similar now that I glance more in the first/last pictures.  I think it's all about how the hair frames the face (I bet I'd make one sexy lady with some professional do up!).  Oh yeah and that shirt in the first pic is NOT flattering for a girl (or anyone really).  I'm 6', I can't even fit into a 5'2"" person's socks...the struggle is real."
uglyduckling,2tcfiv,akay193,5,Fri Jan 23 03:54:47 2015 UTC,"The hair definitely helped, and so did orthodontia. But yeah, once we got her to let her hair grow, it was so much more noticeable that she was a girl.   I tried to get my husband to let me do an up-do with his hair before he chopped it off and he refused. It was past his shoulders and curls naturally, it would a been so pretty! And I can't do it with my hair since I keep getting pixie cuts. Long hair drives me insane."
uglyduckling,2tcfiv,akay193,3,Fri Jan 23 03:59:14 2015 UTC,"Guy missed a golden opportunity!!  It's fun having long hair - for a time.  I'm a guy (if that wasn't apparent) and I had about 12 inches of curly, fiery red afro.  I had a friend straighten it (took about 1.5hours) and it still had massive volume, but it was eye opening, worth the experience.  Finally cut the mess and man, short hair is so much less hassle."

uglyduckling,2ta8jf,DBuckFactory,19,Thu Jan 22 14:04:17 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much! The change in the face was due in [large] part to my orthodontist cracking my palate and expanding it something like 9-11 mm [I think I've blocked out that information, since], and braces."

The device was cemented to a top molar on either side, and it took up all of the space in the roof of my mouth [making speech and eating really adorable]. There was a split down the middle where the crank sat, which is where the ""key"" went. I had to crank it myself, twice a day. Extra cruel.   As the months of cranking went on, the pressure against the sides of my palate was tighter and tighter, causing the device to push up into the roof of my mouth, with nowhere else to go. The roof of my mouth has permanent indents as a result."

My son is currently going through the palate spreader.  He didn't need as much widening as you got, but it's a hell of a lot easier before the bones have hardened!"

uglyduckling,2rb60d,FleeForce,7,Mon Jan 5 04:15:47 2015 UTC,sorry for the late reply:  I'm working in a web-agency and I create digital experiences (web/mobile applications and/or simple websites). My job title is 'User Experience Designer'. I'm involved in the whole process from start (research/concept) to finish (designing and working with the developer to implement the design and the interactions & QA). Altough I have had basic education I'm mostly self-taught. I'm working with a very young and highly flexible team of great people. We have an awesome boss who let's us work however and when the fuck we want - as long as we deliver. I had almost no experience in this field when I started (some basic html skills and an understanding of how the web works) but my boss saw the passion and hunger in me and offered me an internship. After 6 months he offered me a job on a permanent basis and here I am!  edit: If you'd like to learn more about that topic I strongly recommend this website: https://gibbon.co/ It's free and there are tons of courses (known as 'playlists') about several topics. Here's one about the fundamentals of UX: https://gibbon.co/wdeb/user-experience-design-from-a-z  If you have some questions or would like to know more about UX (or web-work in general) just PM me. There are tons of blogs and other great resources available for free on the internet. It's a huge and awesome community!

uglyduckling,2rb60d,k4kuz0,1 point,Sun Jan 4 23:50:29 2015 UTC,"There are so many different hair types man, you're probably just not the same one. I'm white and my hair's curly as hell, I couldn't pull off that look no matter how hard I tried."

uglyduckling,2rb60d,waitwert,1 point,Mon Jan 5 05:38:31 2015 UTC,"thanks dude! like /u/darkguitarist mentioned every hair is different. I'd suggest lurking /r/malefashionadvice (that's what I did). I'm using this product:http://www.themotley.com/hair/hair-style/lock-stock-barrel-pucka-grooming-creme.html (someone recommended that on mfa so I tried it). But the most important part is not the product - it's the haircut itself.   here's how I do my hair, takes about 5 minutes:  1) get the hair wet  2) blow dry it (using a circular brush on the front) - I'm not syling my hair in this step (just giving it a little bit of form)  3) apply product   4) using my hands and a blow dryer I now style my hair  5) optional - add some hairspray. I only do this if I know it will be a long/rough day and I need a long lasting hold. Usually I don't like hairspray because I want to be able to restyle my hair throughout the day. And the ladies prefer the 'natural' feeling of my hair so they can mess around with them (at least that's what I've been told :p )  There are a lot of videos on youtube on how to do your hair like that. Just search for undercut or quiff. And dont forget to lurk mfa ;)"

uglyduckling,2r882g,Geminigrl6791,7,Sat Jan 3 19:42:38 2015 UTC,Thanks for not using a bunch of filters and amazing lighting on the last pic.
uglyduckling,2r882g,c4lmlikeab0mb,7,Sat Jan 3 23:55:33 2015 UTC,"I don't understand filters. I think I used one on the december picture because the lighting was really funky, but that is the only one with a filter. I seriously don't know how the lighting worked like that in that last picture. I was in my dorm and using photobooth."
uglyduckling,2r882g,c4lmlikeab0mb,3,Sun Jan 4 00:43:55 2015 UTC,"Oh no I meant the lighting wasn't amazing either. Like you see some pics on here, the first one is all grey and blurred and just a really bad pic. Then their last pic has all this perfect lighting, and makeup, etc. Making it look like a much more drastic change then it really was if you compare two pics that were more alike."
uglyduckling,2r882g,WeAllWantNiceThings,2,Sun Jan 4 01:28:05 2015 UTC,"Gotcha! Well I still maintain that I don't know why that last picture looks so good (whether it was angles or my makeup abilities).   It was funny, I posted the picture of my first day at school and graduation and it was pointed out that both times I had a sticker in the exact same spot, which I hadn't even noticed.   My goal is to choose similar photos, so I am glad I came through on that.   Edit: I totally just reread your first comment and I am not sure how I misinterpreted that. I am gonna blame the fever I currently have. :)"

Add 500 calories to that and see if you gain weight within 2 weeks...if not, add another 500 cal."

uglyduckling,2qlckj,Musicly2343,1 point,Tue Dec 30 10:45:49 2014 UTC,Haha thanks! Neiman Marcus on the tie. I think a lot of the transformation was mental. I had really pushed myself into believing that being individual was more important than being happy. I had to find that balance.
uglyduckling,2qlckj,Musicly2343,1 point,Tue Dec 30 16:32:58 2014 UTC,Neiman Marcus   .... yeep i'm gonna have to wait until I have a job until I buy anything there. But cheers for telling me where you got it from.

uglyduckling,2qhwx2,Gatorguylol,3,Sat Dec 27 06:39:55 2014 UTC,"My husband was super shy. One day he decided to start putting himself out there more. I happened to be throwing a party and that's when we fell for each other. It's crazy to think that if he hadn't made that pushed we might not have met, at least not for a couple of years. Hopefully that kid you know will gain a little confidence and meet someone who adores him just as much as I adore my husband."
uglyduckling,2qhwx2,HDstream4u,-6,Sat Dec 27 14:11:04 2014 UTC,"This could be said for absolutely everyone. If everyone made a couple of lifestyle changes, everyone could become a stud. However, being a stud is relative to everyone else, so if everyone is a stud, then everyone is in fact normal and therefore no one is a stud. It is lucky that not everyone has the same drive and will power to better themselves because if everyone did, then everyone will not be successful, but in fact normal as success is relative."
uglyduckling,2qhwx2,DoobaDoobaDooba,4,Thu Jan 15 03:28:25 2015 UTC,This sounds like something I'd turn in to meet a word count in English lol

They have not experienced the lifestyle of different cultures, which leaves them to believe that their lifestyle is one that most people on this earth live. This ignorance is not their fault, but a product of government brainwashing."
uglyduckling,2qhwx2,DoobaDoobaDooba,1 point,Fri Jan 16 19:46:53 2015 UTC,"Remember when this was UglyDuckling? So does the government. The constant subliminal broadcasting of their will being imposed upon your feeble mind has left you a husk in the shell of your previous existence. Conspiracies, Stockholm syndrome, and propaganda. These are all words that mean things. This is a really long sentence about things in the world that I am pointing out while surprisingly retaining your attention; seriously, why are you reading this. Andddd we are still on UglyDuckling."
uglyduckling,2qhwx2,chantistar,-5,Fri Jan 16 23:18:15 2015 UTC,"How unfortunate that you grew up in a Western country. Let me take a guess, judging by your use of language and lack of critical thinking, you grew up in America? I have also inferred though careful investigation that you were born in Alabama. Am I correct? Why am I asking if I'm right; of course I am. Even though your state voted against Obama, his government's brainwashing tactics have managed to turn you into a republic loving cowboy of America, set to make a mark in the world, good or bad. If you were to experience the culture of less wealthy countries, you would immediately be repulsed by their rather primitive lifestyles and make an immediate comparison to your homeland, the US of A. Anyway, I would still like to invite you into my home in the Netherlands if you were to ever visit my country, even though you may interpret my way of life to be comparable to the way the Jews lived in the Nazi concentration camps back when Alabama, USA were in secret alliance with Adolf Hitler. Good transformation OP's husband!"

uglyduckling,2qhwx2,DoobaDoobaDooba,2,Sat Dec 27 04:11:24 2014 UTC,That is really a great time to find someone! Having a partner that has gone through the hard work of transforming themselves and understands the hard work you've put in to yourself is such a valuable gift. You two have developed a skill set that is vital to maintaining a solid relationship.

uglyduckling,2qh00a,Gingercuddles,1 point,Fri Jan 2 02:26:10 2015 UTC,Your beard hair and your head hair are two completely different kinds of hair that are controlled by two completely different genes. So your head hair not matching your beard hair color is completely normal and likely won't change much.

uglyduckling,2pjnok,CryHav0c,14,Wed Dec 17 07:08:01 2014 UTC,How has the transformation changed the way people treat you? And do you find that encouraging or discouraging?
uglyduckling,2pjnok,WWHarleyRider,88,Wed Dec 17 07:18:29 2014 UTC,"The way I am treated by strangers is definitely different now. My social life was basically null before, but now I go out to a lot more party's and social gatherings. I used to NEVER (and I mean never) get hit on, but now when I'm at parties it's more frequent. Getting attention from guys is still a new concept to me. The people who I used to know before my ""transformation"" treat me about the same. I have lost about 50 pounds since May, so most of their comments about my change is about that. But other than that, people I've known still treat me the same.  I think it's encouraging how much my life has changed after my looks got better.  What I mean by this is that all the steps I took to improve myself are things everyone can do (lose weight, change hair, fix teeth, ect.). We live in a time where if you're self conscious about something, there are so many options for you to pursue to better yourself. I don't have model genetics or anything but I was able to make myself more confident just by improving the things I didn't like, and it's encouraging to know that if I can do this, literally anyone can."

The same thing happened to me for the most part, and it's many years later and I'm still adjusting.  Just use this as an opportunity to take care of yourself and be healthy.  It's easy to rest on youth and drink every night, but it definitely gets you later on."

uglyduckling,2oy5fs,SolidMiddle,1 point,Thu Dec 11 09:30:43 2014 UTC,Are you somewhere in the age range of 13-19? Then you probably overpluck. (Kidding -- but that was my/everybody's...er...training period.)

uglyduckling,2oy5fs,blackswan91,7,Thu Dec 11 09:49:42 2014 UTC,Brendon Urie has a huge nose and everyone loves him so don't worry about it. If you hadn't mentioned it I probably wouldn't have even noticed your nose.
uglyduckling,2oy5fs,KellynHeller,7,Thu Dec 11 17:52:54 2014 UTC,You look like Zoe Saldana. Which is awesome.

uglyduckling,2oy5fs,sabin357,2,Thu Dec 11 18:38:57 2014 UTC,Well it finally fits my face.  The bad thing about having a larger nose is having a larger surface area of skin so you have a higher chance of getting pimples there... I have a pimple on the side of my nose right now... fml.
uglyduckling,2oy5fs,sheepsuicide,3,Thu Dec 11 18:50:04 2014 UTC,I (also) think you were a really cute kid :) you look gorgeous and I love your hair!

But if I recall correctly, that photo of when I was 15 was taken after having spent a couple of weeks in India so I'd have gotten pretty tan. The picture on the right is probably a little washed out since it was taken in summer sunlight, but it comes pretty close to my natural skin tone. Even though I'm of Indian descent, I am quite fair but can tan very easily and heavily."

uglyduckling,2o6f3l,justacommontater,6,Wed Dec 3 21:14:44 2014 UTC,how powerful do you feel looking at these pics
uglyduckling,2o6f3l,mary_widdow,2,Thu Dec 4 05:29:05 2014 UTC,I sometimes find it hard to believe I ever looked like that.
uglyduckling,2o6f3l,SYKoff,4,Thu Dec 4 14:18:38 2014 UTC,Holy Hell!  That transformation is amazing!
uglyduckling,2o6f3l,Grymninja,3,Thu Dec 4 00:46:30 2014 UTC,damn son
uglyduckling,2o6f3l,JaguarU,4,Thu Dec 4 03:36:53 2014 UTC,So there is hope!
uglyduckling,2o6f3l,bluemannequin,3,Thu Dec 4 05:21:51 2014 UTC,I mean this in the best way possible - this is one of the best ducklings posts I've seen to date.  Nice work and congrats!
uglyduckling,2o6f3l,d_frost,7,Thu Dec 4 06:04:36 2014 UTC,And this is what this sub is for. You look amazing.
uglyduckling,2o6f3l,Wooleyty,3,Wed Dec 3 21:25:52 2014 UTC,Awesome!
uglyduckling,2o6f3l,BrianDR,3,Thu Dec 4 05:26:16 2014 UTC,The change was so dramatic I had trouble figuring out who you were in the following pics!
uglyduckling,2o8gzv,sheamonsterx3,2,Thu Dec 4 05:40:36 2014 UTC,You looked great as a freshman.
uglyduckling,2o8gzv,SlamDrag,2,Mon Dec 8 05:52:44 2014 UTC,"You weren't ever ugly, and I actually like your haircut for a 12-year-old."

uglyduckling,2o8gzv,skinnyasianthrowaway,3,Tue Dec 9 03:30:25 2014 UTC,you were never even ugly...
uglyduckling,2o8gzv,kurtcobain94,1 point,Thu Dec 4 18:40:33 2014 UTC,You are insanely cute
uglyduckling,2o8gzv,niceguysociopath,1 point,Thu Dec 4 18:28:22 2014 UTC,"Meh...you're really cute now, for sure, but to be honest I think you were better off before. The short hair and paler skin really worked for you. Idk if you ever go tanning but if you do you really don't need it. But fuck what I say, if you like how you look then awesome. All that matters is that you're happy when you look in the mirror. I just wish you could have been happy looking in the mirror 4 years ago, you really should have been."
uglyduckling,2o8gzv,niceguysociopath,1 point,Mon Dec 8 13:59:44 2014 UTC,I don't go tanning lol.  I used to always be told that I looked like a boy so it really hurt my self confidence back then.

uglyduckling,2o75z2,LordOfDemise,2,Thu Dec 4 02:53:24 2014 UTC,"You went from just a TARDIS to actually looking like the 10th Doctor. You look good, dude!"

uglyduckling,2o3hrs,AdvocateForGod,4,Wed Dec 3 04:40:18 2014 UTC,Wow. From weird teen boy look to beautiful lady. Also did those dermal piercings hurt when you got them? Also your ex is a total knock out.
uglyduckling,2o3hrs,MoonReject,3,Wed Dec 3 04:04:56 2014 UTC,"Aw thank you! And yeah, she's pretty gorgeous :) I adore her and I'm glad we're still bestfriends."
uglyduckling,2o3hrs,justclay,9,Wed Dec 3 04:51:25 2014 UTC,Beautiful!  PS: You look naked from the waist down in your Cat photo. And I almost freaked out for you.   Edit: mah fone
uglyduckling,2o3hrs,AdvocateForGod,9,Wed Dec 3 00:26:00 2014 UTC,She isn't??
uglyduckling,2o3hrs,Gnes990,3,Wed Dec 3 03:24:09 2014 UTC,I'm still not sure if she is or its just a really tan color underwear.
uglyduckling,2o3hrs,SL1NK,0,Wed Dec 3 04:02:23 2014 UTC,Thank you so much!! <3
uglyduckling,2o3hrs,Gugulio,4,Wed Dec 3 04:19:51 2014 UTC,"I think I'm going to not answer the ""is she naked"" question haha. I didn't realize that much was showing... :s"

uglyduckling,2nx1hi,yourproblematicfave,11,Mon Dec 1 06:10:55 2014 UTC,Did you edit your newest pic? You're beautiful but would probably be even more without the fake looking picture.
uglyduckling,2nx1hi,mariataytay,-1,Mon Dec 1 13:41:24 2014 UTC,"I think I just brightened it up a bit. I don't have photoshop/have the time to learn how to use it so edited colors/contrast is about as ""fake"" as my pictures get."
uglyduckling,2nx1hi,mariataytay,3,Mon Dec 1 17:40:39 2014 UTC,"I didn't mean ""fake"" it a totally negative way! I'm usually looking at pictures of makeup so it's one of the first things I look for."
uglyduckling,2nx1hi,sukiiii,-2,Mon Dec 1 17:55:23 2014 UTC,No worries haha. I just don't understand why someone touching up the lighting on their pic is such a big deal to some of the people commenting.
uglyduckling,2nx1hi,cooljesus69,2,Mon Dec 1 18:02:36 2014 UTC,Why are you acting like you didn't use an app like Facetune or MoreBeaute2 to soften/blur your skin?
uglyduckling,2nx1hi,AzureSkittle,31,Mon Dec 1 20:50:56 2014 UTC,Make sure you filter the shit out of yourself in the last pic. ;)
uglyduckling,2nx1hi,JakeSmithsPhone,-1,Mon Dec 1 11:26:58 2014 UTC,"I dunno. I think it might just be a LOT of makeup and a better camera. I mean she doesn't look miraculous even now, just like a solid 7 or so."
uglyduckling,2nx1hi,AzureSkittle,-17,Mon Dec 1 21:18:43 2014 UTC,"Maybe if I ""filtered the shit out of myself"" I wouldn't look so ""orange"" as one of the other commenters said? I thought this was supposed to be a positive subreddit but maybe I was wrong!"
uglyduckling,2nx1hi,coldvault,10,Mon Dec 1 17:38:37 2014 UTC,Pic 1: age 10 or 11  Pic 2: age 13  Pic 3: age 15  Pic 4: age 19  Pic 5: age 20  Teenage redditors: stay strong. You'll get there eventually.
uglyduckling,2nx1hi,AzureSkittle,-14,Mon Dec 1 06:12:36 2014 UTC,"Well, you certainly got there. But you are unnaturally beautiful. A common person isn't going to come out of puberty quite like you did."
uglyduckling,2nx1hi,Tom_the_Pirat3,14,Mon Dec 1 15:16:18 2014 UTC,"Let us know when you get laid with OP. With smooth lines like that, it's inevitable."

uglyduckling,2nx1hi,dirtyfool33,3,Mon Dec 1 23:06:09 2014 UTC,you mean your panties aren't halfway to China from that?
uglyduckling,2nx1hi,OliveIsABoss,12,Tue Dec 2 00:52:41 2014 UTC,Too Orange
uglyduckling,2nx1hi,cainthefallen,8,Mon Dec 1 06:17:33 2014 UTC,My current pic? Pretty sure it's the lighting...I'm actually pretty pale in person right now.
uglyduckling,2nx1hi,jackrabbit02,2,Mon Dec 1 06:18:33 2014 UTC,"all good, just looking out for you. I feel bad for people who look too orange, either their fake tan fucked up or they were in a tanning bed too long or some other such thing. Sorry if it came across a little harsh also."
uglyduckling,2nx1hi,Conquerz,2,Mon Dec 1 12:32:30 2014 UTC,"You fake tan?  Or real tan?  Either way, you look orange in that last pic, and just kinda pale otherwise."
uglyduckling,2nx1hi,SL1NK,4,Sat Dec 6 19:52:28 2014 UTC,In your opinion.
uglyduckling,2nx1hi,Jill4ChrisRed,3,Tue Dec 2 00:38:23 2014 UTC,Your transformation gives me hope
uglyduckling,2nwck2,Kezas,6,Mon Dec 1 01:57:02 2014 UTC,"I sat looking at the first picture for a few minutes, trying to tell if you were male or female.  pic 2: probably guy, but maybe lesbian... Pic 3: It's a boy!"

uglyduckling,2nwck2,FireImpossible,2,Mon Dec 1 03:22:06 2014 UTC,"How did you lose all that weight and get the motivation to? I need your method, lol."
uglyduckling,2nwck2,Fimbultyr,3,Mon Dec 1 03:28:32 2014 UTC,"It's honestly not hard to lose the weight. The hardest part is going to the gym and lifting. You don't even need to go to the gym if you're only goal is to just be skinny.  You can easily lose the weight if you just consistently eat healthier and less. It really is that easy.   My motivation to start was because I hated how I looked, hated being self conscious, and hated the teasing from my friends. I just finally got to a point where I was finished with all of it and decided to change my life.  It really is a lifestyle change, not a temporary change.  Hope that helps :)"
uglyduckling,2nwck2,I_huff_acetone,2,Mon Dec 1 04:35:49 2014 UTC,Thanks man.

Don't have the height to model. :(   Had no idea what rodd and gunn was until this post. Just went to their website now. Most of the stuff is totally my style. But in my opinion the thrill of wearing vintage style clothing is thrifting most of your pieces. Got the blazer in this pic for 2 dollars.

uglyduckling,2lawmz,SamW4Life,17,Wed Nov 5 01:33:16 2014 UTC,"Honestly, I'm getting a bit tired of seeing people here who call themselves ugly ducklings when they were never ugly."
uglyduckling,2lawmz,blackswan91,6,Wed Nov 5 11:50:45 2014 UTC,"My guess is that kids in school made them feel like shit.   I tell my friends I was an ugly duckling, but they think I'm just saying that when they see pictures of me. The thing is they weren't there when a group of girls were listing off the guys in 7th grade deciding whether they were cute or not. When someone mentioned me, the group is scattered with ""EEWWW NO!""s and vicious laughter."
uglyduckling,2lawmz,Sindelian,3,Wed Nov 5 16:22:36 2014 UTC,"Could be that kids in school made them feel that way, but I have a hard time to believe this girl in particular experienced those things. Ugly ducklings imo are either overweight or too skinny with a weird/greasy hairdo and having braces. Just really awkward looking. It's a shame if she thinks she was ugly before, but to me it looks like she's just fishing for compliments. Btw, it's a fact that those girls made fun of you. Your belief of you being ugly is your evaluation and it might not be so necessarily :)"
uglyduckling,2lawmz,blackswan91,1 point,Wed Nov 5 16:42:34 2014 UTC,"My opinion: yes she was very pretty as a young girl.   Possiblity: the other kids considered her not as pretty by comparison to the prettiest girls, and therefore made her feel inadequate or maybe straight up picked on her.   I'll never underestimate the viciousness of 10 to 18 year olds."
uglyduckling,2lawmz,Sindelian,2,Wed Nov 5 20:24:31 2014 UTC,"I'm going to guess the opposite, actually, for most of the perpetually non-ugly people. They were kids with low self-esteem, who felt inadequate and insecure about their looks when they were young. As they age and grow into themselves, that sentiment remains in a ""Man, look how ugly I was back then,"" because being ugly during that period is a part of the mental narrative they have for their lives.  Basically, ""I thought I was ugly back then, but I know I'm not now!"" and attributing it to getting more attractive instead of having self esteem.  DISCLAIMER: I am not at all qualified in any way to support this, it is a complete guess."

[To commenters]: the whole point of this subreddit is that there was a time when people didn't have high opinions of themselves, but now they're willing to share what they look like and who they are to a supportive community.  So your job isn't to evaluate whether people's feelings are ""valid"", your job is to support them."

uglyduckling,2kv0gg,A-D-A-M_,9,Fri Oct 31 06:03:25 2014 UTC,"But how did you do it, any tricks for someone who is trying to do the same?"
uglyduckling,2kv0gg,rentmaster,20,Fri Oct 31 06:11:39 2014 UTC,"Step one: Got out of a mentally draining, psychologically abusive relationship.   Step two: Started eating better. Knocked Fast Food/Sodas out of my diet completely  Step Three. Try to be active at least three times a week for at least an hour. This started with jogging. Then I started working out once I didn't feel so bad about my weight.   Confidence Skyrocketed from there. Hope it helps. Good luck on your journey! :)"
uglyduckling,2kv0gg,JunkyThought,7,Fri Oct 31 06:17:50 2014 UTC,"Not OP, but I recently lost a bit of weight, so I hope you'll want my advice. I think the key is not to look for a 'trick'. I always looked for new ways of losing fast and none really stuck. The only thing that worked for me was to go to the gym every single day. This is easier for me than others because I am a college student, but it was the only way I could lose weight. It doesn't mean that you have to be there forever - I just run on the treadmill for forty minutes and leave. But committing to going every day (with weekends off) was the only real way to do it. I hope that helped a little; I know it isn't what most people want to hear, but it was the only way.  Good luck!"
uglyduckling,2kv0gg,the_real_chronos,11,Fri Oct 31 06:15:58 2014 UTC,Eating better and running consistently is always a great start to losing the initial pounds that help you gain the confidence and stay on track! Great advice man.
uglyduckling,2kv0gg,JunkyThought,2,Fri Oct 31 06:22:15 2014 UTC,40 minutes of cardio? Holy shit dude get a good bodybuilding lifting routine going. You're wasting your time at the gym.
uglyduckling,2kv0gg,the_real_chronos,3,Sat Nov 8 08:04:49 2014 UTC,"Why do you say that, out of curiosity? I'm relatively new to the fitness scene, so I'm not exactly well-versed. Keep in mind that I am a relatively small girl. I want to get opinions on what's best for my body type."
uglyduckling,2kv0gg,JunkyThought,2,Sat Nov 8 09:40:00 2014 UTC,"I assumed you were a guy, but my advice still applies. You don't want to go to a gym and do only cardio. Sure you will burn some fat and have better cardiovascular endurance, but you are not really training your muscles for anything at all.  If you just do cardio you'll be missing out on a tighter body (thighs, arms, glutes, legs) and you'll just look skinny at best.   Now for a girl, being skinny/fit is perfectly fine (though you should really at least squat with some weights). But for a guy it is extremely important to do weight lifting, because being skinny really means nothing for the average guy."
uglyduckling,2kv0gg,the_real_chronos,2,Tue Nov 11 01:44:09 2014 UTC,Thanks for the input! I think I'm going to add some muscle stuff to my routine tonight now. Everyone can use some tightening up.
uglyduckling,2kv0gg,freckledcupcake,1 point,Tue Nov 11 14:02:02 2014 UTC,"Yes! Try finding a good routine, maybe online or if you have a trainer in your gym you can ask around. Also don't forget about nutrition, you can exercise all you want but if you have a poor diet and have an excess of calories/lack of protein you won't be looking good any time soon.  Like they say, ""A body is made in the kitchen and sculpted in the gym."""

uglyduckling,2kh2ww,lovelessllama,2,Mon Oct 27 17:20:29 2014 UTC,I think people with braces in their first photos should always include a full smile pic to show the progress. Are you happy with what the braces did for you?
uglyduckling,2kh2ww,havocxtreme,6,Mon Oct 27 21:09:50 2014 UTC,"Here is a picture of my smile.  It's very hard for me to find a picture where I smile fully, but I would say that I absolutely loved what the braces did for me. I had something called an irregular eruption pattern that was made worse by calcium deficiency, where some of my teeth didn't come in until I was in my late teens. I got my last four baby teeth pulled at 16 and then had to do a bunch of surgeries and such to get them fixed. The braces were a part of that. Now I have a great smile! I just need to get my teeth whitened.  After literally never smiling my entire life because of how weird my teeth were / the gaps for missing teeth, it is taking a long time for me to learn to smile properly. Besides, I kind of like my smirk."

Being a nerd is not some exclusive club. By telling people (specifically women) to show their ""nerd cred"" all you do is exclude some potentially amazing people from sharing in a hobby you both might enjoy. Who cares if a girl doesn't know a lot about gaming, or comics, or cinema?

uglyduckling,2k7hg5,twister-girl,7,Fri Oct 24 22:18:01 2014 UTC,First pic looks like you were balding or something. So OP prob thought the bad lighting was lack of hair.
uglyduckling,2k7hg5,Lorkovicious,8,Fri Oct 24 23:00:30 2014 UTC,"I had long hair that was pulled back. It was terrible. But yeah, I was cursed with a high hair line."
uglyduckling,2k7hg5,chantistar,1 point,Fri Oct 24 23:05:39 2014 UTC,A hair transplant is the process of relocating hair follicles to balding areas. Each individual follicle is nicknamed a 'plug'. It's quite a common procedure and yields great results.  tl;dr: He was asking if you had a hair transplant because it looked like you were balding pretty badly in the earlier photos.
uglyduckling,2k7hg5,chantistar,1 point,Fri Oct 24 23:08:23 2014 UTC,"Hair transplantation:       Hair transplantation is a surgical technique that moves individual hair follicles from a part of the body called the 'donor site' to bald or balding part of the body known as the 'recipient site'. It is primarily used to treat male pattern baldness. In this minimally invasive procedure, grafts containing hair follicles that are genetically resistant to balding are transplanted to the bald scalp. It can also be used to restore eyelashes, eyebrows, beard hair, chest hair, pubic hair and to fill in scars caused by accidents or surgery such as face-lifts and previous hair transplants. Hair transplantation differs from skin grafting in that grafts contain almost all of the epidermis and dermis surrounding the hair follicle, and many tiny grafts are transplanted rather than a single strip of skin.

uglyduckling,2k4f6d,ElBiscuit,12,Thu Oct 23 21:23:48 2014 UTC,"Right you are! It was valid as photo ID for two years and officially expired completely about two weeks ago, I pulled it out of storage yesterday (haven't been overseas since I was 13) to renew it, and had a bit of a laugh over the photo.   EDIT: fixing up some autocorrect"

uglyduckling,2k4f6d,MrMcCringleberry,8,Thu Oct 23 22:25:29 2014 UTC,"It still is! which is why I tend to take photos at the angle that I did - I actually posted in /r/MakeupAddiction a while ago about it, about how I use lipstick to hide it but, if you tilt your head haha (sorry) you can still see it... the head tilt and lipstick are diversion tactics.  I have no idea what caused it, if anything it's getting more prominent /: definitely one of my most ridiculous insecurities"
uglyduckling,2k4f6d,knudude,3,Thu Oct 23 22:33:17 2014 UTC,"I hear you on the insecurity, mine does the same thing. Someone once told me it might be TMJ but after visiting a dentist I think mine might be caused by very large wisdom teeth that are under my gums still."
uglyduckling,2k4f6d,knudude,4,Thu Oct 23 22:53:20 2014 UTC,"One thing I can think of is when I was about 7 or 8 I slipped over on a wet wooden deck and my tooth went through my lip, I can't remember what side it was on because it didn't break though the skin on my chin, but in the lip itself (if that makes sense) so there's no prominent scar. So if it was the left side it could be scar tissue inside that part of my lip?"

I'm planning on moving over when I've finished my pregrad, to go to a postgrad film school in London, England has always felt like my second home, can't wait to make it permanent :)"

uglyduckling,2jratv,Hybirds,9,Mon Oct 20 19:46:36 2014 UTC,"Not OP, but I can recommend a few things:   Do NOT towel dry your hair, get a decent blowdryer with changeable tips.  While blow drying your hair, run your fingers or a comb through it repeatedly to keep it up while drying. You should notice after it is pretty much dry that it should stay up pretty decently without any product (but you will need some for it to stay like that all day). Don't cheap out on hair product! You don't need to go insanely crazy on hair product, but paying a bit more for a product from a salon vs. a drug store is well worth it. You typically have to use less (so it lasts longer) and doesn't leave residue or such things. I personally use TIGI Bed Head Men Matte Seperation and love it.  Don't use shampoo everyday (Depending on your hair, this could be one of the most important things). I personally use Shampoo every fourth day, after about two to three weeks, your hair doesn't look greasy/oily anymore at all and it gives your hair a ton of volume and styling capabilities. The day I have to use shampoo is actually the day my hair looks the worst."

Eventually I just focused more on lifting and allowed myself to eat at maintenance.  I have been about 200-215 for the past 2 years.  205 generally.

uglyduckling,2igka4,Sciar,4,Mon Oct 6 23:38:25 2014 UTC,no. people aren't coloring their faces purple with makeup. theyre covering blemishes and emphasizing facial features. going from asian black/brown eyes to creepy fake blue isn't cosmetically similar to just putting on makeup.
uglyduckling,2igka4,Wakka_bot,5,Tue Oct 7 02:52:05 2014 UTC,Makeup often changes shades and colors of everything surrounding the eyes but now we're gonna stay at some girls pride for changing the color of the eye itself?   It's such a stupid thing cosmetic is cosmetic and done for similar reasons no matter the look modification and shouldn't be crapped on.

uglyduckling,2i5vev,AdvocateForGod,3,Sat Oct 4 22:03:09 2014 UTC,Lol you just negated your own point. Bitchy is an adjective describing my resting face. Your way then resting is an adjective describing my bitch face. Totally different things.

Have you accepted the new you and left some old tendencies that made you quirky locked away, if you were quirky? You have seen both worlds -- what have you learned if any?"
uglyduckling,2hsmw3,InfoSponger,4,Tue Sep 30 03:02:45 2014 UTC,"I had to really think about this one, so sorry for the essay.  I was always insanely shy and socially awkward, and I never fully got over that.  I still can't talk to guys like, at all, and I never notice if/when they're interested, but that’s getting better.    I noticed that my classmates became nicer as the years went by.  They were never bullies (save a few insensitive offhand comments), but they were definitely friendlier.  My close friend group stayed pretty much the same.  As I made some new friends though, there was always a nagging at the back of my mind.  I can't help but wonder if people would have wanted to be friends with me if I still looked that way.  People say looks don't matter, but we all know that, to some extent, they do.  I try not to judge people based on appearance, and I look down on others who make nasty comments.  I know what it’s like to be on the other side of those judgments, and it generally keeps me from making them in turn.  However, we've all done it, and I feel terrible when I do, because that used to be me.  I think a lot of us can relate to that here.   I’ve never let go of who I used to be.  I've let my quirks show more as my confidence has risen.  Sometimes I'm ashamed of my past though.  I untagged all those pictures.  I wonder if my peers remember what I used to look like, or when I meet new people, I think, “Thank God he doesn't know I used to look like that”.  But really, what does it matter? It’s who I am, I think it helped build my character, and it’s shown me a lot about the nature of people with regards to appearance."

uglyduckling,2hrda4,WDT1990,14,Mon Sep 29 04:07:07 2014 UTC,Looking good! Did your hair get straight or did you straighten it for that picture? Considered cutting it shorter so you don't have to slick it back like that? A cut that has a bit of longer fringe in front could help minimize the impact of your forehead
uglyduckling,2hrda4,133713,12,Mon Sep 29 06:25:43 2014 UTC,"agree. the slicked hair makes you look older than 24- about 10 or so years I would say! You're still young, would definitely recommend some of the tousled hairstyles as recommended by /u/freckledcupcake here. wonderful transformation!"
uglyduckling,2hrda4,_wander,2,Mon Sep 29 07:46:53 2014 UTC,"A little of both the former and the latter haha. I have it chemically straightened every four months or so. I usually wouldn't go down that as it's so damaging for the hair; however there's a new treatment in Australia that is formaldehyde free and actually repairs the hair as opposed to damaging it. I've had it done twice now and as far as I can tell I haven't lost a single hair.   I've been styling it that way for a while now; I've been trying to go for a 'bradley cooper in The Hangover' sort of a look. Can I ask, how would a longer fringe help minimize the impact of my forehead? I'm not quite sure what you mean there?"
uglyduckling,2hrda4,133713,7,Mon Sep 29 06:35:42 2014 UTC,"I meant your forehead looks kinda big, and letting your hair fall over it could look a lot better :)"
uglyduckling,2hrda4,freckledcupcake,3,Mon Sep 29 07:24:14 2014 UTC,I would do something more like these to work with your curls rather than working against them(aka: find the right product and make it work!):  one      two  three

This is my third time being on an anti-biotic, before this, I was dealing with just scars and red marks...now I have to start over, which is quite frustrating.   I have thought about accutane and will consider it with my derm next time if my acne persists.   Just trying to keep positive atm until that light comes through! :)"

uglyduckling,2fpcsx,beatboxpoems,1 point,Sun Sep 7 14:02:38 2014 UTC,True but also you can see from the top few super models that angular faces and strong brow bones are a thing.  No arguing that.

uglyduckling,2dnwvn,Lord_Sanders,12,Fri Aug 15 20:04:39 2014 UTC,Kids should be kids. Looking to be attractive to others comes later. Both times of life should be honored and savored. And you look like you are enjoying both.

uglyduckling,2dnwvn,Mintilina,1 point,Sat Aug 16 15:00:54 2014 UTC,"Great thing to say, and I hope everyone posting on/viewing this sub has as positive and healthy an attitude as you on that. It's easy to place too much importance on looks in life in a subreddit like this, but really everyone looks fine both before and after, they just get more conventionally attractive and sometimes happier/more confident. I guess I think it's important to recognize that as sometimes people almost seem to have resentment toward their earlier self for acting or looking a certain way, when that's really not necessary or important.   You looked adorable btw and congrats on the fashion sense/puberty win!"

uglyduckling,2dex1t,TINYDANCER07,6,Wed Aug 13 14:29:04 2014 UTC,"Thank you for the compliment! I like to think of myself as more of a hard worker rather than extremely intelligent, so I tend to stray away from bragging in any context. More than often I only bring up my job if directly asked in some way or if I suspect I have a fellow nerd in my presence. I've found that most guys will take it as a blow to their ego and most girls will take it as some kind of territorial threat, even if I don't mean it in any of those contexts. I've heard that I don't ""look the part"", as if you have to be overweight and ugly to be an engineer. But luckily nerds, god bless them, tend to get extremely excited when I mention my love of nuclear power... if I mention it in a group setting there will, without doubt, be table announcements made. ""Hey guys! Did you know she was a nuclear engineer in the Navy?!"". The wingmen of the group will almost always attempt to set me up with the closest professional connection (ex. engineer or physicist). I always thought that was pretty awkward, but I'm a very friendly and open person now, so I've learned to just roll with it. All in all, I've learned to deliver this piece of information about myself in the right setting if I want to make friends. The struggle is real if you're a female engineer in today's workforce."
uglyduckling,2dex1t,emit_,2,Wed Aug 13 18:58:34 2014 UTC,I know about that trouble. One of my best friends is an engineer and she was the only female in the course and usually the only female in the engineering department of anywhere she worked.

However, let me throw in my two cents if I may: Once again, sports are great and they can get you in shape and teach you a lot of good things. However, now on the brink of 22 with a lot of friends who were high school athletes, let me tell you that it is VERY hard to sustain such an active lifestyle so young and that I've found a lot of high school athletes can become very complacent adults in my personal experience. On a similar note, it's not about finding the quickest solution, but, rather, a lifestyle (corny, sorry). People who find quick solutions 1) Usually don't keep it off and 2) Didn't address any of the mental/emotional flaws they had and became complete pieces of shit once they got their comeuppance. You're young dude, you still have a while to make small changes that will spiral out much better than going HAM and hating yourself will"

The main reason I posted this here instead of /r/loseit was because the physical change has really been this past year (I've dropped 70lbs since last September), so it's kinda been weird having to adjust to, say, girls being okay with me making eye contact with them and smiling haha but I've definitely been going through a longer transition from cringey to bullied and quiet to angry and sad to letting go and being happy"

Bazillion kids solely browsing imgur, downvoting me to oblivion for posting selfies..jesus...  Anyway, little story. Losing weight and dressing better and performing helped my confidence and social anxiety incredibly. Throughout high school and half of college, I had pretty low self esteem, not that many friends, and issues with food. Then I sort of went the other way and probably had a definable eating disorder for two years and then evened back out. The point is; spending time on yourself and getting your outside to reflect how you feel like you should be on the inside has been the most holistically beneficial improvement I have spent my time on."

I get is done every two months. Call up some high-end non-commercial style salon and ask if they have any stylist who perform keratin Treatments to straighten your hair.

uglyduckling,2ar43c,AwakEning123,3,Tue Jul 15 19:02:19 2014 UTC,"How did you go about losing weight, and what do you do to keep it off? I'm a 22 year old guy that has always struggled with weight. I maxed out at 275, and got on a diet and went down to about 240, but due to lack of dedication I fell off the wagon and went back up to 255. Then last august got on another diet, went from 255 to 210, fell off the wagon again hard. I've gained back a lot of the weight that I had lost the second time around. One of the hardest things I've been dealing with lately is getting back on the diet. Also, and this might be a really personal question, how did you deal with all of the extra skin from the weight loss? That's something I noticed after my recent diet is the skin just... hangs there."
uglyduckling,2ar43c,SimonAndGarpunkel,3,Tue Jul 15 21:09:45 2014 UTC,"Well the thing was I never really dieted, when I was a kid I developed really bad eating habits so its more like I switched to eating a more average diet. I also increased my outdoor activity, I was a very classic indoor kid. I found this easier then going to the gym as I've often find working out monotonous.     As for the extra skins, I won't lie it's definitely a thing. I was lucky I lost the weight as early as I did as it can be a much more serious issue if you lose weight later in life. Also it is an issue that can definitely be improved with exercise. Keep at it I remember when I was in high school and I would attempt to lose weight by dieting thinking it would take years, and in the end I was right, just back then I didn't think the time would be worth it. Good luck."

uglyduckling,2ae7eh,M374L,16,Fri Jul 11 03:15:04 2014 UTC,VIKING FIGHTING? Tell me more. This sounds amazing.
uglyduckling,2ae7eh,Boxwizard,4,Fri Jul 11 21:42:10 2014 UTC,"There's so much I could talk about, but here are a couple of videos for you for a brief little introduction. I live in Texas and this was a documentary done about specifically the Texas vikings in a world wide brotherhood. It was shot about a year and a half before I joined in.   It's worth noting that most of these two videos focus about when we go across the seas to different festivals, which have two parts: A really large training aspect and a public show aspect (shown mostly in the videos).  But a short(ish) textual description: We're live steel martial artists who focus on learning the disciplines and fighting styles of Dark Age/Migration period vikings through historical evidence and historical fight manuals. It's based out of Europe but has groups (lags) all around the world. There are multiple ""viking age"" groups but the biggest one, the one I train in, is called The Army of Jomsborg. We use steel, blunted weapons to train together and spar as well as promoting brotherhood, unity, and lifelong ties. Our range of weapons include, but are not limited to, Viking long sword, langseax, scramseax, Dane axe, hand axes (bearded and non), 1h spear, and 2h spear. While it is historical re-enactment on the surface, a lot of us take it to heart as a true discipline to answer the call of the sword and all around better ourselves and each other.  To Go Viking Trailer - 1:45 To Go Viking Promo - 4:32"
uglyduckling,2ae7eh,Boxwizard,3,Sat Jul 12 05:07:25 2014 UTC,"My ancestral blood is calling me. This sounds awesome! Seriously, I'm ridiculosly interested. I'm a Swede so I should probably be able to find some groups..."
uglyduckling,2ae7eh,Dups_47,1 point,Sat Jul 12 07:56:56 2014 UTC,"In the promo video someone says that it's not a re-enactment, its a real fight; they then show someone wearing a helmet that has a big dent in it.  Are you taking full force swings on each other? Even if the weapons aren't sharp, does anybody get seriously injured?"
uglyduckling,2ae7eh,Marclee1703,1 point,Sat Jul 12 10:34:17 2014 UTC,"There are three different styles in which we fight, but to do all of them we are all very well trained with a focus on safety for our partners. We also have different gear to protect vital areas.   The clusterfuck style of fighting you see in the video is called Eastern Style which focuses on hard hits with being allowed to crown someone on the head with a weapon, but not directly thrust them in the face. This style requires a gambeson, a specially made protective, padded leather vest, and a steel helm in addition to our usual training gear.   Western style is our most commonly trained fighting style. It is torso(balls count too) and upper leg shots only. No hands, feet, or anywhere near the head is allowed. It's also the safest. This style requires knee pads, leather bracers, and gloves.  Then there's full target fighting similar to HEMA. Any shots goes, it hits harder than western, but not as hard as eastern. For this style a high guage fencing mast and gorget is required as well as a gambeson and all of out usual gear.  People do get hurt yes, sometimes seriously, but not as often as you might think since we're all well trained. Head shots in western usually aren't serious as long as you had good control if your weapon, but they could get ugly if you don't. My sparring partner had to get stitches on her forehead last year because the head training officer was fighting with a weapon combination he was rusty with and gave her a bad head shot. Also, one head shot = one beer. Or depending on the severity, a pitcher or 5 of beer. Beer is tasty."
uglyduckling,2ae7eh,CorncobJohnson,1 point,Sat Jul 12 18:26:12 2014 UTC,I'm here for the viking talk!   You enjoying the show? The second season finale was badass! Are you aware of reenactment in Europe. It's very much focused on 'authenticity'. The use of real materials and basing stuff as much as possible on what we know of history. LARP and Reenactment in Europe is just on a different level than overseas. Exception is of course Civil War reenactors. Those guys are very dedicated and strict I believe. Very comparable.

uglyduckling,296sza,xenorama,5,Fri Jun 27 05:00:44 2014 UTC,What made you pick up breakdancing specifically? Had you done it in the past or did you start getting involved during college? Oh and good job OP!
uglyduckling,296sza,xenorama,6,Fri Jun 27 00:57:16 2014 UTC,"Thanks! I initially learned off of Youtube videos in high school, but I started taking it seriously in college. I'm really glad I chose to learn how to dance, because it's a huge part of my identity today. I'm not even sure why I started, because back then I could never have imagined myself having the rhythm, confidence, or physical ability to do the stuff I do today."
uglyduckling,296sza,xenorama,1 point,Fri Jun 27 17:35:16 2014 UTC,What videos did you watch or moves did you practice to start out with if you dont mind me asking? I always wanted to learn breakdancing but always seemed to difficult
uglyduckling,296sza,iamkatemiddleton,8,Mon Jun 30 16:39:19 2014 UTC,"Here's a list of common basic moves you can look up tutorials for on Youtube. I divided them into four different categories.   Toprock -- Indian step, hip twist, side step. Toprock is mostly about being able to dance and groove while standing up though, so learning some other hip-hop styles like cwalking, house dance, etc. can help a lot.  Footwork -- CCs, six step, three step, two step, twelve step, pretzels  Freezes -- Handglide freeze, turtle freeze, baby freeze, nike freeze   Powermoves -- Backspin, crickets, handglide spin, windmill  Even though these are just the basics, it'll take a LONG time to get these down solid. I suggest you work on a couple of them at a time until you feel comfortable, then move onto others. Once you have a decent grasp of some of the moves, work on putting them together.   It is very difficult at first, because lots of breakdance moves require a ton of dexterity, precision, strength, and flexibility. There's a reason why breaking is probably one of the most respected hobbies and skills out there, because it takes a ridiculous amount of dedication and discipline. I think it's worth it in the end, because it's a skill you'll always have no matter what, and a way of expression that is uniquely yours. Good luck!"
uglyduckling,296sza,Doublehandbanger,1 point,Mon Jun 30 20:57:59 2014 UTC,"Thanks. And one last question, do you recommend taking dancing classes to learn breakdancing? or is it something you can learn on your own?"
uglyduckling,296sza,dofsmartins,2,Sat Jul 5 19:34:38 2014 UTC,"Classes can definitely help, but it's possible to get to a pretty high level without taking any classes. I'd say that I'm a pretty advanced dancer nowadays in that it's not hard to tell that I've been doing this for a very long time, and I've never taken classes before."

uglyduckling,296sza,TouchaCat,6,Fri Jun 27 00:57:20 2014 UTC,"Hang in there dude. Looking young, especially as an Asian guy who already has to go against emasculating stereotypes, really sucks. A lot of people won't take you seriously or will treat you like a kid as opposed to like a man. The best way to lose the ""baby face"" is to get to a low bodyfat percentage. It'll be hard because Asians typically hold onto face fat a lot more, but in the end it's worth it. Looking back, the difference in the way I'm treated now in comparison to the way I used to be treated is astronomical. Good luck."

uglyduckling,28wxz4,strivingforever,4,Tue Jun 24 22:55:58 2014 UTC,"A 12 yr old course? I don't even know what you mean by that. Your niece shouldn't be wearing makeup at 8, its defiantly not the norm. A little eyeshadow and lip gloss when they are playing dress up is fine, but I seriously doubt she is wearing daily full on make up like an adult, or like a 17 year old would (primer, foundation, concealer, eye liner, mascara, eye shadow, brow filler, etc etc). I bet you are a teenage boy so you really can't discuss makeup now can you?"
uglyduckling,28wxz4,pillage4life,-11,Tue Jun 24 23:06:48 2014 UTC,Teenage man more like and no I will not discuss make up

First day that i walked into work everyone was like wtf why did you do that we love your hair etc. Keep it clean and you will do great

The ""raised eyebrow/quirky expression"" thing is something a lot of guys do but, to be honest, it usually just makes me assume they're insecure, and you have no reason to be! A nice smile makes you look cool and confident, while pulling a face makes me think you're not comfortable in your own skin so you have to ""put on an act"" to take a picture. You're a very good-looking guy, you don't need to pull a face to look cute!"
uglyduckling,289783,NeekaSqueaka,5,Mon Jun 16 15:46:26 2014 UTC,Haha I suck at smiling but I will try more. I always look weird that's why I don't do it much.

Only extremely pale eyes don't look dark in dim indoor conditions. I have grey eyes and most indoor light is kind of yellowish, so yellow+darkness=dark eyes. Sunlight is way way brighter and is less colored so my eyes look much lighter in sunlight. Your pupils automatically adjust  for brightness and your brain automatically adjusts the color balance so you don't notice much of a difference IRL but its shows up in photos"

uglyduckling,282zqx,Fingebimus,9,Fri Jun 13 21:45:52 2014 UTC,I got lucky because I have really straight and thick hair so it's not much of a hassle other than having to cut it often. I use Malin + Goetz in my hair because it's one of the only things I've found that hold my hair during the summer in Texas. Everything else sort of just loses hold cause of the sun.

uglyduckling,282zqx,IfThisNameIsTaken,10,Fri Jun 13 22:00:48 2014 UTC,"Yeah dude my best advice honestly is be very, very particular when you get your haircut unless you have a dude you go to all the time. Use a barbershop that caters to younger clientele instead of some salon. Have some reference pictures and don't go in and just say ""Uhh, I want this"". It'll take a little bit to get it down exactly but work with the barber and figure out how high you want your sides cut/how short and excreta. Tell him you'd rather have him/her cut it a little too long than a little too short. I usually say stuff like ""use a 1/2 guard on the sides and cut it up to the line where it was cut last time(I don't blend my hair I just shave it up to where it is ontop) and leave the length on top where it is but thin it out a bit towards the front so it lays better when it's back"". When your hair gets to the cut you like take a picture of it for future reference and when you go in for a cut style it like you usually do or else they might cut it a little different. Find a person you like and get their card.  Took me a few bad haircuts before I started telling people exactly how I want my hair done. Sorry for the long American Psycho esq reply."

Might end up trimming it soon, it's actually ~2 inches long on the bottom now but it's curly. I might buzz it down once it gets heavier and the hairs straighten out."

uglyduckling,27k8m9,yoci,3,Sun Jun 8 03:08:05 2014 UTC,Oh god...I would have to submit a ton of pictures lol...but it would have to be when I was 11...I pretty much had a unibrow and was pretty chunky...I will definitely be posting in the future!

They were all wangs anyway and I didn't really think any of them were hot, so I don't think it'd be as validating as it would be if I went to a larger school—if that makes sense?"

uglyduckling,258gpq,Sciar,5,Sun May 11 00:46:57 2014 UTC,You might have improved but you were actually really pretty even younger. If you call that an ugly picture I think there are a lot of women out there who might want to maul you to death in their jealous rage.

uglyduckling,258gpq,Sciar,1 point,Sun May 11 02:36:37 2014 UTC,"I'm not sure if this will help but the only reason I find people ever feel really bad about their personal image is because of the criteria they select for comparison. Next time you're out sit down and look around the bus/subway any public area and count out ten people.  I'm willing to bet out of your sample of ten available people you're more attractive than all of them.  Then up the size to the entire bus, lets say you're having an unlucky day and there's one person you feel is more attractive than you on the bus.   It quickly starts to put it in perspective how you rate globally vs. how you rate compared to the hottest latest celebrities or whatever other media you're constantly absorbing.   I'm not the prettiest man on the planet by any means, but I feel like I'm a pretty damn good looking guy especially when I look at everybody as a sample. When I just think about the most attractive people as my comparison point it's pretty easy to start feeling like you look terrible.   Anyways I dated a very pretty girl once who seemed to benefit significantly from having me share this mentality, maybe it's useful for you too."
uglyduckling,258gpq,Sciar,2,Sun May 11 03:16:54 2014 UTC,I appreciate that. It makes sense and would probably help. But my issue isn't completely comparing myself with other people. It's honestly mainly just how I feel when I look at myself. Like I'll be sitting and look at my legs and have to completely reposition myself AND avert my eyes because I hate how it looks. Or start crying at the mirror lol. But I do appreciate your input and should try that.

Maybe you won't get EVERY girl you want to, but it's not about levels (""I can't get this level of girl"") NO, you can, maybe this particular girl won't say yes, but it's not her level that you can't get, it's just her.

I guess that's something the photos don't really show well, but I think it's the most critical part of getting out of the 'ugly duckling' phase.

I think we all carry our awkward phase with us throughout life, but it's something that adds to your character, not take away from it. That said, I think what's more important is developing self-esteem and a sense of worth along the way. I know I don't fit conventional standards of attractiveness - few people do, in fact, yet we hold that to be the norm and constantly strive for it. Getting to the point where you can say 'Screw it all' and just learn to love yourself is more profound than any outward transformation. However, I hope you can get your cake and also eat it!"

uglyduckling,252u04,Lorkovicious,1 point,Sat May 10 09:47:28 2014 UTC,"Well, I was in those exact same shoes, right around that age too. Many times I had given up, resigned myself to a life of 'forever alone.' But that there is the first problem, and the first step to getting out of it. Stop thinking negatively, because all you'll see around you is negativity, especially in yourself. Re-prioritize and put you first, not a hypothetical girlfriend or anyone else. See how you can improve as a person starting with what you CAN control - could be at school, work, hobbies, talents, fitness, even the way you dress. And while you do all of this you have to not give any fucks about other people or about the world. Turn that loathing energy into something else, something productive. Yeah, I know it's really hard to take in while you're in that phase, but trust me (a stranger on the Internet) that you can and will get there. Just don't give up, and make sure the friends you have are people you can trust and will stick by your side. Let go of the ones who aren't or won't.  I still have slip ups now, but I'm pretty happy. Much, much happier than before."

uglyduckling,245l6w,mog75,32,Mon Apr 28 04:09:10 2014 UTC,"I agree. I used to be extremely insecure about how I looked. When I first started dating my wife, guys would hit on her while I was standing right there... Now, no one does that anymore.  I always have a soft spot for the smaller guys I see in the gym. I can completely relate to their situation and I'm always silently rooting for them."
uglyduckling,245l6w,Chewbacker,18,Mon Apr 28 04:16:41 2014 UTC,"Don't be silent, man. Let them know."
uglyduckling,245l6w,faisalm1991,26,Mon Apr 28 07:02:30 2014 UTC,"I should really change that. I've just been really careful about approaching others while they're working out. I've noticed that people are a lot more sensitive at the gym and are more prone to taking things the wrong way.   The last thing I want to do is come off to some one as ""high and mighty"" and weird them out, so I've always kept the head low and headphones in, only really speaking to people when they approach me."
uglyduckling,245l6w,Throwcore,5,Mon Apr 28 13:55:10 2014 UTC,it's great to know there are guys like you at the gym rooting for the rest of us!
uglyduckling,245l6w,Throwcore,3,Mon Apr 28 05:52:38 2014 UTC,"Been lifting for 3 years on and off. By on and off i mean i did 1 year with a trainer, got nowhere. Then i did 1 year of kettlebell, also with a trainer and group, and got nowhere. Now did 1 year with a friend who knows what he's doing. Got nowhere (weight gain wise).  Never been able to keep a steady diet. I have eaten more but still got nowhere. Supplements are iffy because my parents and one doctor told me they are bad, but i feel like i couldn't get anywhere without them and i just hope they aren't bad (by supplemnts i mean protein/creatine).  Anyway, 22 years old, at 53kg as a male (which is like 110 pounds), kissless and a fucking virgin. I don't think there is rooting strong enough at this point.... sigh."
uglyduckling,245l6w,faisalm1991,1 point,Sat May 3 13:29:31 2014 UTC,"I think it all depends on how badly you want it. Your entire post basically states exactly why you haven't gotten anywhere. You already know what the problems are. How badly do you want to fix them?  1) Fix your diet. In your case, you're not going to get anywhere if you don't eat enough. This post helped me determine what my maintenance calories and macros are:  http://forum.bodybuilding.com/showthread.php?t=121703981  I used a fat caliper to get as accurate measurements as I could and used the Katch-McArdle formula. Once I got my numbers, I ate that calorie/macro split for a week or two. Did I gain weight? Reduce calories by 100. Did I lose weight? Increase calories by 100. Did my weight remain the same? Congrats, you've found maintenance. At this point, if I wanted to get bigger, I added 500 calories to my maintenance. If I wanted to get leaner, I deducted 500 calories from my maintenance. Increasing or decreasing my weight is incredibly easy for me now. I've got my diet in such straight order, sometimes I feel like I'm cheating with some unknown secret.  2) Finding a lifting routine you like and stick with it. A popular one in /r/fitness is Starting Strength. This is a strength building routine that will teach you the fundamentals of the main compound lifts (deadlift, squat, benchpress, overhead press). Once you've finished that, you can move on to more advanced routines that fit your goal, be it powerlifting or bodybuilding.  The most important thing to gain from all of this is DO NOT STOP. You need to remain consistent. If you're trying to bulk, hitting your daily calorie goal a couple days here or a couple days there isn't going to do shit. You need to eat the same EVERYDAY, until your ""bulking period"" is done. Same with training. Only pushing yourself certain days and then skipping out other days isn't going to get you anywhere. Stop training with the same weight day in and day out. If you're still lifting with the same numbers several months later, you're not pushing yourself. Push yourself for heavier weights or more reps each week. Eat big lift big. There's really no other way around it."
uglyduckling,245l6w,scottsouth,1 point,Sat May 3 15:15:25 2014 UTC,"Me and my friend have been doing starting strength for the past year. And the numbers I lifted did improve, for example from a measly 30kg bench press to a still measly 40kg bench press, although compared to myself at least it was an improvement. But gaining weight? Nope. Also I don't know how you people manage to somehow do it but the diet part literally requires you to build your entire life around it. And stuff like... I just had Septoplasty done for a second time because my nasal bone was not straight, and it means 6 weeks of no physical activity what so ever. I mean with shit like this coming up all the time how the fuck do you ""never skip a day"". It's fucking impossible.  The truth is I don't even like bodybuilding that much. The only point to it is that it's a sport, it makes you move/excersize and is therefore healthy, and it's seemingly required to get fucking ANYWHERE with women.   Oh I'm a 52kg little faggot? You die a virgin then. Whatever. Honestly I don't even care at this point, because all I see around me is people who have had it 15x easier (and I don't mean you) and what the fuck is the point."
uglyduckling,245l6w,websqueeze,1 point,Sat May 3 15:26:09 2014 UTC,"I understand the frustration. The diet part does seem like a lot, especially for someone who's not used to tracking everything they eat. After awhile it will seem like second nature. I don't really think about it anymore since I already know what foods I respond best to.   I don't really eat out anymore, however if you do, then this may be harder for you. It really is a lifestyle change. So, unfortunately, if that's out of the question for you, then there's not much more advice I can give you :/  As the old adage goes, ""if it were easy, then everyone would do it"".   Also, if you don't like bodybuilding, then don't do it. I hate cardio. So, guess what I don't do much of ;)  It doesn't make sense to do something everyday that you hate. You're less inclined to remain consistent. Find a sport or activity you love that you can use to reach your goal, and be consistent."

uglyduckling,23555q,PhoOhThree,2,Wed Apr 16 06:11:21 2014 UTC,"Yeah, but that's basically what this sub is about. There are three things that can drastically change one's appearance: fashion, puberty, and weight loss. Ugly duckling is a subreddit about the change one underwent through one of these methods. We shouldn't try to stop people from showing how they changed after puberty. After all, the ugly duckling grew up to be a swan. Puberty is a time when we can change everything about ourselves. Of course, there is luck involved, but often the change you see after someone undergoes puberty is often the result of the teen's own effort. The only time a post should be disliked is when they were obviously handsome or beautiful from the start.  Tldr: Don't hate on the teens yo"

Most models start out with a ""mother agency"" who trains them and helps along the way in connecting with bigger agencies like Ford, elite, Wilhelmina, etc. In the mean time, find a friend who takes pictures and ask them to help you out with some shots, just to get comfortable in front of a camera!

For muscle, I had no life and my brother is a personal trainer so I could go to the gym everyday (super plus for me to have him around I recommend getting a trainer 100%)"
uglyduckling,22zbop,fiqar,1 point,Mon Apr 14 14:57:32 2014 UTC,"He probably won't answer, but I don't think he did anything special. As you can see from the pics, he was fat when he was young and lost weight at some point, going from fat to the 'skinny fat' you see in the non muscular picture. All he did there was lose his fat by eating less calories than he burnt. After that, gaining muscle isn't hard. Eat more, meet your protein needs and you'll gain the muscle. It's a slow climb but it'll happen - trying to do it quickly will just make you fat again."

uglyduckling,22toj7,NegativeNancy18,3,Sat Apr 12 11:35:55 2014 UTC,"Your teeth are seriously perfect.  My teeth were really awful when I was young, they were literally all over my mouth! I got them sorted and now people say my teeth are perfect and that they're jealous of them! Even my boyfriend who has perfect teeth stares at mine randomly and says how he's so jealous of them. So I think having really bad teeth when younger isn't really a bad thing because dentists seem to work twice as hard to make them perfect."

uglyduckling,22tqud,passionatesocks,8,Wed Apr 16 02:27:31 2014 UTC,You were never an ugly person at all. The only thing is you had the syndrome a lot of younger girls go through these days. Where you were 13 and looked like you were about 18. Now you're 20 and look like you're about 18. You literally haven't changed since that 13 year old photo of you in the pink shirt on the boat. Except you added glasses.
uglyduckling,22tqud,PuddinTubes,6,Wed Apr 16 12:29:07 2014 UTC,Going to have to downvote because you have to actually be ugly at one point.

uglyduckling,21zxny,cyberkitten,19,Thu Apr 3 03:10:36 2014 UTC,Why down votes?? Dudes just asking what I know everyone here is wondering.
uglyduckling,21zxny,redmustang04,17,Wed Apr 2 13:42:20 2014 UTC,"Because it's none of our business. Just because we've seen pictures of her post-transformation does not mean that we deserve to know the answer to that question.  And before you say something along the lines of, ""well we still have the right to ask/wonder...."" you're right. But along the same lines, we have a right to downvote questions we do not agree with being asked."
uglyduckling,21zxny,redmustang04,21,Thu Apr 3 03:13:56 2014 UTC,"Wow, still kinda hard to believe you got downvoted for urging people to be polite. Clearly there aren't many people versed in polite vs impolite questions when it comes to trans people in here. But good for you for trying."
uglyduckling,21zxny,Dagoth_Draal,7,Sun Apr 13 05:11:03 2014 UTC,"Whatever. Reddit uses upvotes/downvotes as a way to keep people from speaking out against ""their"" norm, but all they really do it succeed at showing what assholes the majority is.  But thanks a bunch for not being that asshole. I'm glad you agree with me."
uglyduckling,21zxny,Dagoth_Draal,4,Sun Apr 13 20:05:13 2014 UTC,"Give her a chance to defend herself.  You can't know what she finds and doesn't find offensive.  And honestly she is putting her experience on a public forum, so most questions we can ask are fair game.  She can choose not to answer them if she wants, which so far she hasn't."
uglyduckling,21zxny,Dagoth_Draal,16,Thu Apr 3 04:50:49 2014 UTC,"I've already quoted her previous comment, and I'll do it again.

uglyduckling,21zxny,wildontherun,13,Thu Apr 3 06:52:27 2014 UTC,"Yes, that has to be the only reason. No other reason to ask something like this to someone who is willfully sharing her story."

uglyduckling,21zxny,Puskaa,1 point,Wed Apr 2 16:54:25 2014 UTC,"Looking at your picture, you are wearing a mario cap, meaning you were or probably still a gamer. How does that impact your change? I mean I don't know if you this addicted gamer, or you are just a casual gamer, but I feel like going through something like a sex change, takes a lot of time, emotions and much of your life. So in other words, did you drop out gaming while you were going through all that? The only reason I am asking that is because I am a gamer, and usually I like to game, if i am having a bad day or trying to suppress something, so in other words, if you were an hardcore gamer, it just wasn't enough wasn't it?"

Even though every doctor that isn't some back country quack agree that its the best course of action  The State I live in requires me to have surgery before I can change my gender marker on my drivers license, its pretty embarrassing trying to cash a check with it :("

uglyduckling,21zxny,happypockettoad,3,Fri Jul 18 09:09:08 2014 UTC,"I agree, all natural, and that was the ugly duckling phase into a lovely lady.  It seems second puberty did you well. I have a friend that went through this and it is emotional until you feel you have become what you are on this inside.  He use to be a girl, but now as a man he feels like his true self.  It is great to find that, and hard to transition to."

uglyduckling,21xrie,k4osth3ory,2,Wed Apr 2 05:33:38 2014 UTC,"It seems like the consensus in the thread is that the changes were only due to makeup. While I don't agree ( acne since grade 6, was really out of shape when I was younger, bad grooming etc) , it did make me realize that maybe I was too harsh on my self when I was younger. Always being teased about being ugly really didn't help myself esteem."

How did you get rid of your man boobs? did they completely disappear as you lost weight? Was there a point during the wight loss that they stayed the same?  I'm asking because two years ago i lost 35lbs and went from 200 to 165 but i didn't see very outstanding changes in my moobs as compared to the rest of my body. They obviously decreased but i thought that by then they would've been almost gone.. Did you experience something similar? Maybe i should've kept losing more weight?

uglyduckling,21337s,Dewey382,10,Sun Mar 23 07:21:25 2014 UTC,I tried all sorts of products but nothing helped much. Changing my diet (cutting out sugary and greasy foods) and drinking a lot more water played a huge part. A lot of it was hormone-related; as I got older I got fewer breakouts.
uglyduckling,21337s,BlastShadow,5,Sat Mar 22 17:43:22 2014 UTC,How much water are we speaking?

uglyduckling,21337s,ArthurDigbyS,10,Sat Mar 22 17:52:10 2014 UTC,"There was definitely a conscious decision to change. Not so much looks-wise, but mentally. I have dealt with chronic depression since my early teens. I really let myself go, to caught up in it to care much about anything. Slowly, I realized I was never going to be happy living like that and I started forcing myself to be proactive in becoming a better person. The physical change was just kind of a side effect of me becoming happy with who I was on the inside."

That's the first problem. I also took some hardcore kidney meds as a kid and that stained them as well, but the biggest game changer in my teeth whitening was getting new, permanent, expensive, fake teeth. My dentist had me use some pre-filled trays, and I'd leave them in for an hour or two a day for I think 2 weeks. I can find out and let you know! But thank you!"

I imagine the older ones figured out what they liked and went with that and the granddaughters are trying different things to find out what they like.

uglyduckling,20pyjp,Samonuh,0,Tue Mar 18 15:41:50 2014 UTC,99% of the time a woman looks better with long hair. no disputing it.    That's your opinion. Is it that hard to grasp? I love short hair over long hair in most cases. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder.

You shaved them a bit too much, so let them grow back a bit into the middle (but not like before!). Also just trim the top inside corner hairs so that they don't stick out as much. Just take little scissors and align your hair with the rest of your brow."

As a girl growing up with some crazy eyebrows, I know how much of a difference it can make in others' perceptions and this guy needs it."

uglyduckling,1zjad3,IrrationalConsumer,27,Tue Mar 4 15:38:29 2014 UTC,"I don't mean to be rude, but it seems like a lot of the ""final stage"" pictures on this subreddit are always super pixelated. I understand just scrounging around for a modern picture, but why so low quality?   eidt: grammar"
uglyduckling,1zjad3,DrSinistar,23,Tue Mar 4 17:08:04 2014 UTC,"My guess would be that a lot of people these days take the photos they like best of themselves as selfies on their phones. This would be a little less than best quality anyway, but also consider that they might be documenting themselves looking at their best just before going on a night out, so the photo is taken without natural light.  That's why all my favourite pictures of myself are bad quality, at least."
uglyduckling,1zjad3,Ihaveafatcat,11,Tue Mar 4 17:27:34 2014 UTC,Pretty much sums up my feelings and why there's all these low-res photos posted as the 'final stage'.
uglyduckling,1zjad3,DrSinistar,22,Tue Mar 4 17:35:26 2014 UTC,"Fair question. I can only speak for myself but I usually only take photos with the front camera on my iPhone which = low quality raw images in most situations.    And then I must admit as a female - it's hard to go past using a filter on the final photo.    Then you're usually left with a huge ass file when you transfer it to your computer so you have to resize it if you want to upload it etc.  I've only had my current hair for about three days so don't have many unfiltered photos to pull out. Here's a photo I've tried not to make 'super pixelated' and kept the original file size - hell I even sharpened it for good measure, I don't think it detracts from the fact that I do look different from nine years ago."
uglyduckling,1zjad3,Louaym,5,Tue Mar 4 17:25:45 2014 UTC,"No, it doesn't detract from the fact. I'm just picky when it comes to consistent image quality in an album.   That is a very nice picture! Thank you for the upload, the hair is very pretty."

uglyduckling,1zjad3,Louaym,-2,Tue Mar 4 17:17:51 2014 UTC,It just irritates me when people completely ignore the subject matter when they comment and ask an IT question instead. Consequently I met your comment with snark.
uglyduckling,1zjad3,KingGorilla,0,Tue Mar 4 17:27:47 2014 UTC,"Lol, that wasn't even an IT question. I would think that you would realize that it's not Imgur's fault that the final picture is super pixelated, but I thought wrong.   Also, it is completely relevant. This subreddit is for people to upload pictures of their changes, but often their final picture looks like ass, while every other picture is of respectable quality. It limits how much change we can actually see."

uglyduckling,1zjad3,shalamar82,8,Tue Mar 4 18:43:54 2014 UTC,Did your irisis get bigger? Contacts?
uglyduckling,1zjad3,shalamar82,0,Tue Mar 4 22:23:19 2014 UTC,Haha not going to lie I do like wearing circle lenses (lenses Asians wear to make your eyes look bigger or to change the colour) so I think I'm wearing them in about half of these photos but in general I think once I lost weight my eyes started losing that chinky look and they just looked bigger on my smaller face.
uglyduckling,1zjad3,ohhhhboyyyy,6,Wed Mar 5 01:55:53 2014 UTC,"Yes, eyes do get bigger as you lose weight on your face. Seems from your other comments that you are mixed, but I sincerely hope you can be proud of your look as an Asian (half), and not associate it negatively."
uglyduckling,1zjad3,djeinstine,6,Wed Mar 5 06:36:56 2014 UTC,"Oh believe me, I'm one of the most culturally proud half Asians you'll meet, I think some people are misunderstanding my comments because they don't know me personally and they think I'm ashamed of being Asian or I throw around the word 'chinky' in a derogatory way (though I get if you get offended; me, my family and Asian friends use words like that and joke around with non-PC terms).  As for people feeling uncomfortable about me wearing lenses to make my eyes look bigger, it's totally a practice based around Asian fashion (particularly Japanese) and not because I want to look non-Asian haha. People may find that hard to believe but that's the truth!   Thanks for the comment anyway, gives me a chance to explain myself."
uglyduckling,1zjad3,cadmiumred,-1,Wed Mar 5 08:47:13 2014 UTC,'chinky' ...seriously!?!
uglyduckling,1zjad3,cadmiumred,3,Wed Mar 5 04:09:15 2014 UTC,"Sorry if you find that offensive but I honestly would not have a problem with using that word with my family, Asian friends or Asian strangers and we often joke around with that term.  I understand you don't have to be Asian to get offended and I understand why I'd get downvoted but I don't feel the need to not be myself and be totally PC."
uglyduckling,1zjad3,Arkgain,-9,Wed Mar 5 08:54:43 2014 UTC,"The language you use in private where you may be using it ironically/jokingly, and everyone involved is aware that that is the case is one thing, but using the same language in public is rather different.   If being yourself means being knowingly offensive to a huge number of people then perhaps you should reconsider how much of yourself you want to show in public - it may have little to no consequences in this environment but in the real world as I know it, using that kind of language would certainly create a confrontation.  Anyway I still appreciate you replied and explained your point of view."
uglyduckling,1zjad3,wooktar,13,Thu Mar 6 08:14:34 2014 UTC,wow. def improved. congrats
uglyduckling,1zjad3,Colorfag,8,Tue Mar 4 15:51:48 2014 UTC,Puberty and self motivation propelled you to a 10/10. Congrats.
uglyduckling,1zjad3,rupesmanuva,3,Tue Mar 4 19:44:45 2014 UTC,How did you lose the weight?? I'd love to know :D
uglyduckling,1zjad3,Louaym,3,Wed Mar 5 03:04:01 2014 UTC,"I think I owe it to you to give you an honest answer, lots of fasting, calorie counting and drinking diet sodas. I don't recommend it at all and I think my metabolism only could put up with it because I was young. I also became super untoned.   Now at 22, I'm trying to fix all that by weight training at the gym and cardio.  But yeah that's the sad honest answer."
uglyduckling,1zjad3,Louaym,4,Wed Mar 5 09:02:05 2014 UTC,"Thank you so much for the response! I understand. I've been on a weightloss journey for years now, and the temptation to speed things along with minimal calorie intake is always there. Good for you, turning it around!

uglyduckling,1yualj,Empress_Lycisca,28,Mon Feb 24 23:50:32 2014 UTC,"You have one interesting look.  Not a look I'm particularly attracted to, but to those who you'd score pretty highly. You have great eyes and a lovely facial bone structure. I'd like to see a picture under normal conditions, and maybe without the makeup."
uglyduckling,1yualj,live_free,5,Tue Feb 25 00:04:36 2014 UTC,I'm the first to admit the heavy eye makeup is the result of me maintaining pre-pubescent confidence levels. My insecurities (especially concerning the size of my eyes) make it very rare for me to leave the house sans a full face of makeup.  The best I can do is super grungy pictures of me from when I had to go traipsing around in the woods to earn extra credit for a class. one und two
uglyduckling,1yualj,MidnightFlight,3,Tue Feb 25 00:58:34 2014 UTC,"Same. I feel like the look in pic 4 is so much nicer.  But to each his own. Whatever makes you happy, OP."
uglyduckling,1yualj,jagger13,2,Tue Feb 25 00:08:17 2014 UTC,"no offense to OP but it looks like the ""lovely facial bone structure"" you see in the photos is just the result of makeup + angle + her sucking in her cheeks and pursing her lips."
uglyduckling,1yualj,mutterfunker,5,Tue Feb 25 09:12:08 2014 UTC,That's really all it is. I'm a criminal offender of contour powder and werking my angles.

uglyduckling,1ym2h6,coldvault,2,Sat Feb 22 10:05:10 2014 UTC,"I guess that would be a more accurate description, but having jeans that were tagged husky has always made me associate with that word.   And yeah, I live in California."

uglyduckling,1ym2h6,englishamerican,3,Sat Feb 22 14:26:17 2014 UTC,"It's not so much people's perceptions but how I saw myself. Sporting a 36"" inch waist wasn't very desirable. Very much mental during the teenage years."

uglyduckling,1yi230,raznog,5,Fri Feb 21 03:14:46 2014 UTC,Damn no way look better now. Though I think it's probably due more to fashion choices than physical changes.
uglyduckling,1yi230,Throwcore,3,Wed Feb 26 17:48:50 2014 UTC,Actually 16 you looks much friendlier to be honest.
uglyduckling,1yi230,viotate,6,Mon Feb 24 19:01:53 2014 UTC,"man I've been through some ugly shit between those two pictures. I never experienced depression till I was 20. I lived with my drug addict brother for a year, he stole my instruments and pawned them, I hit him with a beer bottle and went to jail, plus so much more shit. I'm still the same on the inside; I think every day is a new layer. Im just starting to develop my callous, thats all.  Edit: Im also better with girls. So if that means I come off like an asshole at first, HEY why not. And I actually used to be MEANER when I was 16. I made fun of everyone, called girls fat, all kinds of crap I don't do now. One time I said to this girl ""You have the most predictable personality ever"" and then later she confronted me about it and I felt pretty bad. Thats probably when I started to be a little more curtious"

uglyduckling,1xpr9e,PenetratingGranny,33,Wed Feb 12 15:56:43 2014 UTC,"One of the best of these transformations I've seen. Fair play to you, it's hard going starting that change, but well worth it."
uglyduckling,1xpr9e,gkalmbach,11,Wed Feb 12 17:27:29 2014 UTC,you're right it is very worth it. :) and thank you.
uglyduckling,1xpr9e,MalloryMarie,4,Wed Feb 12 17:33:19 2014 UTC,I love seeing all these transformations but man they really depress me because I can't lose my weight.. maybe its just harder in your 40s..   congrats btw!!
uglyduckling,1xpr9e,SumKunt,10,Wed Feb 12 20:52:14 2014 UTC,Thank you.. You can do it..just stay motivated and dont give up. :)
uglyduckling,1xpr9e,eraserhead,4,Wed Feb 12 20:55:44 2014 UTC,"Oh, it's DEFINITELY harder the older you get. In my early 20's, it took me like ... a month of semi-consistent working out to lose the weight I packed on in the winter. In my late 20's (which I don't even feel is that old!), it takes months of hard work AND good diet to shed the weight I lost before with minimal diet change and casual working out.   The older you get, the more your body starts to hate you. It's true. :-("

uglyduckling,1xpr9e,CleanMyWounds53013,6,Thu Feb 13 04:52:11 2014 UTC,"The difference is startling, amazing, and (I'm sure) very gratifying for you!   I lost 90 pounds several decades ago (and have kept the majority of it off, I'm happy to report), but I had several experiences that made me kind of resentful: there were several women with whom I crossed paths maybe once or twice a week for several years; I thought they were attractive, and would attempt to make conversation with them, but as far as they were concerned, I was invisible (a fairly common reaction when you're fat).   A year and 90 pounds later, I ran into several if them (on different occasions), re - introduced myself, and not only did they have no recollection of the ever having met me, they came on to me, strong.  While I appreciated the attention, I politely extricated myself from the conversation and walked away, a little sad both at their shallowness as well as my own: how often had I missed the opportunity to get to know someone who was sweet, fun, funny, charming, etc. simply because I wasn't immediately attracted to the shell they live in?   I've never looked at people the same way."
uglyduckling,1xpr9e,reddtipbot,2,Wed Feb 12 21:42:48 2014 UTC,"It's really not that messed up bro, I'm allowed to say this cause I'm still fat even though I lost 85lbs and I'm fine with people being shallow because the motto what attracts you is the looks what gets you to stay is the personality. Honestly, why does fat slobby me deserve the girl I find really attarctive, I treated myself like crap with food for years, when I'm done if I get the same attitude, fuck em."

uglyduckling,1xn5q7,junk2sa,2,Tue Feb 11 23:39:17 2014 UTC,Thanks. Can you diverge some about your success? Did you do any special diet or old-fashion calorie counting? Did you start exercising?
uglyduckling,1xn5q7,inferi22,4,Tue Feb 11 23:45:00 2014 UTC,"I started to use My Fitness Pal and keep track of what I ate on a daily basis. That helped some, but I am convinced that I have the metabolism of a snail or something because the calorie deficit alone was not enough to make me lose weight. It helped some, but not at the rate that I wanted everything to happen.  I started going to a community college in August and I happen to live 2 miles away from the campus. I walked there and back every day for atleast a month or two. 4 miles a day has a way of making me lose weight pretty fast. It was so fast that 190-170 happened in what seemed to be a week (was probably longer but it literally dropped off).  Now I stopped at 170 for a while, but after venturing around and doing things I'm finally at the point where I want to move on and get to that state of nirvana with my body. I'm starting to count my calories again and I now walk home from school, even though its cold. If it wasn't cold I'd walk both ways, but its way too cold in the morning to walk 2 miles. On days that it's warmer, 40's, i throw some shorts on, my sneakers, and a t shirt and go jog for a mile and a half and then walk the remaining mile back to my house. The mile and half is amazing to me because I have not ran since 10th grade and I do not remember being able to run for this long since middle school or earlier."

I understand liking the brightness, I would just put them under a layer of your natural color. That way the roots won't be glaringly obvious within a week or two (at least for me they were) and the highlights will look a little more sophisticated while you can still enjoy the contrast =) Just a suggestion!"

uglyduckling,1ws12d,GDBird,11,Sun Feb 2 04:17:24 2014 UTC,"I see it in the tiny things. His facial structure is handsome, but at some periods he probably  had no idea about his hair, and acne never helps self esteem. Also the smile in the ID pic prob did it for him. I think it was there all along, he just needed to find it."
uglyduckling,1ws12d,atavan_halen,2,Sun Feb 2 04:22:43 2014 UTC,Isn't every (non-famous) kid like that? I feel like 12 year old me would have found 12 year old him hot.
uglyduckling,1ws12d,GDBird,4,Fri Feb 7 05:38:49 2014 UTC,But is he ugly?
uglyduckling,1ws12d,NeverNo,3,Sun Feb 2 04:24:03 2014 UTC,"I would say no, because it was hiding underneath a whole lot of funk, but there is certainly a transition to a more confident and more attractive man."
uglyduckling,1ws12d,Odins-raven,5,Sun Feb 2 04:33:39 2014 UTC,"Like the majority of the people who post on this sub, I was an 'awkward' duckling. I didn't see too many truly ugly people on here. Just people, like me, who hadn't grown into their own sense of self and style.  Bowl cuts or buzzcuts, vests and ill-fitting clothes my mom picked out, and periods of being uncomfortably lanky (think: Stephen Merchant) with acne and braces made me feel pretty awkward and ugly throughout high school."

uglyduckling,1wohk8,kmart9706,7,Fri Jan 31 22:08:45 2014 UTC,something about the way you put your (not so much) younger self down made me feel pretty sad.
uglyduckling,1wohk8,sephera,10,Sat Feb 1 06:37:49 2014 UTC,"What's actually a lot more sad is that looking through old pictures of myself for this post was so painful that it drew tears. That younger me was deeply unhappy. I was desperate for other people's approval, but I was bullied for how I looked, how I talked, and what I thought was important in this world. I could have been the bigger person and dealt with mean kids in a collected, classy way, but instead I acted like a bitch and caused a lot of people to dislike me. It didn't have to be that way, but I did it to myself, and that furthered my loneliness and resentment of other people. Even as I changed (both physically and socially) in high school, other kids remembered me as I was when I was younger. Most girls didn't want to be friends with me, and no guy ever showed any interest in me. I didn't have a date to junior or senior prom, I was never invited to a party, and I had never been properly kissed.  Now that I'm away at college, out of my hometown, starting fresh, I've come to realize all that I was missing in high school. I've sort of been reborn. Everything's turned around for me  emotionally and socially. I believe in my worth as a person, and screw anyone who disagrees (although that hasn't been a problem I've faced here). I can be friendly and genuine without people remembering how I used to act towards them and questioning my integrity. I'm one of those people who's just happy most of the time. I can walk into a party with mad confidence. Those are all huge things for me.  So while I'm not sorry I was that girl -- she's part of what made me who I am today -- I'm really, really, really glad I don't have to be her anymore."
