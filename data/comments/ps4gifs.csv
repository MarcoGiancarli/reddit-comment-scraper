ps4gifs,3bxeta,TauriqM,1 point,Mon Jul 6 09:43:26 2015 UTC,Uploaded the video to YouTube via the PS4.  Then I went into Imgur clicked on the arrow next to Upload images and clicked Video to Gif   There you can use Imgur's tool to select up to 15 seconds of footage that will turn into a gif image. They have a new format called gifv that basically transforms the gif into a compressed video for you to view at any time.

A game in the 70s on Metacritic while all others (including this one) are in the 90s.  So if you liked Origins you'll probably really enjoy Arkham Knight.  Personally, it's great except the Batmobile stuff to me."

They recently passed their Kickstarter goal, so I guess they released the demo to celebrate or generate more interest. It's still in its early days, so the demo is Single Player only and quite glitchy. Demo is up on the Store if you want to try it out."

A random guy in a full lobby stole a bus and just started picking up other players (I was one of them). Eventually we had a pretty full bus, just cruising around the city. It stayed civil for a while, with us all flipping eachother off, doing gestures, putting on our masks etc.   And then the guns came out. And so did the police. So we were just speeding around the city with guns sticking out of most of the windows of this beaten up bus, just slaughtering cops and other players. It was so fun."

The only reason I bought a keyboard was because my FC (guild) constantly pestered me that I don't chat enough (obviously, typing with a controller isn't ideal).

ps4gifs,2xdvoz,BigBoss9293,7,Fri Feb 27 19:44:43 2015 UTC,Holy shit that last moment where he pleads for mercy. I've never played the multiplayer. What causes that? Are you playing against AI? Is it an automatic emotion animation when a character is downed? Is the player able to trigger his character to show an emotional plea?
ps4gifs,2xdvoz,orionsbelt05,9,Fri Feb 27 19:59:05 2015 UTC,"Its multiplayer! If you haven't played it, you MUST! Very underrated. Make sure to party up with others though, if you want you can add me. And in the clip, it was the execution animation! Check out this video that shows some new ones they added recently: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xhx2a-xMKeI  However, in single player you are able to have the characters plead. All you do is hit them to the ground (you should be able to pick them up normally) and just point your weapon at them. They will begin to plead for their life, ""Hey man...be cool, lets talk about this!"" ""Please, don't shoot"", its really cool, feels very fluid in the brutal world of Last of Us. Here is a GIF showing this in action: https://gfycat.com/BigInformalIndusriverdolphin"

ps4gifs,2wrlzr,PutYouToSleep,2,Sun Feb 22 20:17:59 2015 UTC,"Hah, no no. It really does look like it though and I'm sure you could do it if you're some sort of master of timing but look closely, they are two different weapons  :)  When you throw a weapon you will automatically equip another one from your weapon-wheel."
ps4gifs,2wrlzr,PutYouToSleep,1 point,Sun Feb 22 21:26:58 2015 UTC,Thanks! I did notice they were a little different. Like I said I haven't played the game so ya know there could've been different forms or whatever.

ps4gifs,2wor4a,HeavenHole,4,Sat Feb 21 20:17:40 2015 UTC,"I just got this game yesterday, and drop kicking is the best feature so far"
ps4gifs,2wor4a,Creativeusernam3,2,Sat Feb 21 21:08:30 2015 UTC,"When I heard this was a spiritual Dead Island sequel I wasn't particularly interested. I thought the concept of Dead Island was fun, and the environment was actually pretty creative, but the game got repetitive really quickly. Then I read the reviews for Dying Light and they all compared it to Dead Island, one going as far to say that if you liked Dead Island you'll like Dying Light. That again turned me off. By god these gyfs and videos look great though. I might have to wait for this to go on sale or something."
ps4gifs,2wor4a,polakbob,1 point,Sat Feb 21 23:25:20 2015 UTC,"I enjoyed it a lot more than Dead Island. Also, drop kicks ARE so satisfying to do, especially to zombies off the roof of buildings."
ps4gifs,2wor4a,allchiefedup,1 point,Sat Feb 21 23:45:39 2015 UTC,"I played Dead Island, and you can see the way it influenced Dying Light, but they are also very different. Dying Light is WAY better. Controls feel tighter, it's more fun to explore (way more open), everything is more polished. It's also legitimately scary. Really enjoying this game more than I thought I would. I didn't even finish Dead Island, it felt like a chore trying to get to the end, but I've played hours of Dying Light and I'm only at about 12% story completion."

ps4gifs,2wfho9,Scoldrozy,2,Fri Feb 20 05:34:44 2015 UTC,I threw a remote bomb on a car that was shooting at me (a custom vehicle owned by the user).  I waited a few minutes to give him time to forgot about it. I then detonated it while he was many blocks away destroying both his car and him along with it.
ps4gifs,2wdxxd,crantastic,2,Thu Feb 19 02:39:16 2015 UTC,As a Steelers fan I hate you. That was nice though.

ps4gifs,2vqr98,GamerX44,2,Fri Feb 13 21:15:25 2015 UTC,"Definitely go straight for Grounded. There's no listen mode, virtually no supplies, and both you and enemies die super fast. It's where the real challenge is."

ps4gifs,2vcxs4,antwilliams89,0,Tue Feb 10 07:56:20 2015 UTC,"False. It's cops vs criminals. Only one game mode features robbing banks. The criminals also take hostages, make meth, grow weed, steal cars, and rob armoured trucks, among other things."
