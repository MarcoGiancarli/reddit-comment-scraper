AnythingGoesNews,3e28rh,plutonicraven,2,Tue Jul 21 15:35:52 2015 UTC,"Oliver is awesome for this. He chews up complex matters and delivers them ready for public consumption (of course with some liberal bias spices)   His ""dick pic"" critique of NSA spying is a perfect example."
AnythingGoesNews,3e28rh,godiebiel,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:56:24 2015 UTC,"If properly spent, the money should already be going to the city, buying local resources, hiring local construction workers, providing people with jobs as stadium staff. So then the city gets tax off the ticket revenue. And a good stadium can be used for thousands of other kinds of events."
AnythingGoesNews,3e28rh,zodberg,7,Tue Jul 21 13:02:15 2015 UTC,"Except that that never happens.  It's more like, build us a stadium, we'll charge people to get in, no money for you.  We'll sell stuff, nope, you don't get the money for that either.  And if our stadium isn't perfect, we'll threaten to leave until you build us a new one at your expense, and we keep the revinue for anything happening there."
AnythingGoesNews,3e28rh,maiqthetrue,2,Tue Jul 21 13:21:07 2015 UTC,"They also use the tactic of pitting levels of local government against each other, such as a city vs a county. Sports teams do the same as other businesses today: close to bribing/blackmailing officials into competing for jobs and economic activity. The only way around it is for a united front among government(s), but where are there ethical governments?"
AnythingGoesNews,3e28rh,sugarfreeeyecandy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:42:35 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say never. The City of Arlington is paying off the debt they incurred years early. Source. After that, all the additional tax revenue, and their cut of the parking fees from all the events at the stadium is a return on their initial investment. And there are a lot of events. The College Football National Championship game, as well as multiple big name match regular season match ups through the college football season, the Super Bowl, NBA All Star Game,  Pacquiao boxing matches, the CONCACAF Gold Cup, NCAA Men's Final Four, and several grammy winning artists just scratch the surface of the events that the stadium brought (obiously that's in addition to the Cowboys Football games, that being their home stadium).  So to say it never pays off for a city is not true. Cities need to demand more from the teams before they hand over the cash. Stop letting the teams walk all over them and make sure they can come out ahead like Arlington did with the Cowboys."

AnythingGoesNews,3dww7l,ShaunaDorothy,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:14:44 2015 UTC,"http://www.thenation.com/article/my-teeth-hurt-from-grinning-washington-football-brand-dealt-legal-blow/  Traveling today through Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, site of the most critical—and bloody—Northern victory of the Civil War, I saw perhaps three Confederate flags up in front of people’s homes, emblazoned with the phrase, “Keep the Flag Flying!”  It was shameful to see a flag of racist terror so close to this hallowed ground. But it was also a reminder that there will always be dead-enders in this world: people who look at the 21st century and can only summon the urge to retreat. Racism is the ultimate dead end. It’s an embrace of violence and oppression, as well as a concession to the fantastical idea that time can somehow be turned backward. It says that we can lumber regressively toward a proud “tradition” that was largely fantasy and anything but proud.  The Confederate Flag is, as we have written about before, connected with iron chains to the logo of the Washington football team, and just as the flag is being denied official sanction over state houses of the South, the football logo was dealt a devastating blow on Wednesday. Judge Gerald Bruce Lee, in strikingly definitive terms, affirmed a previous ruling and ordered the federal Patent and Trademark Office to cancel the team’s trademark registration. Judge Lee wrote in his 70-page decision that the name meets the “legal standard” for defamation in that it “may disparage” a substantial part of the Native American community. In proving that the name met this standard, Judge Lee did not reference academic texts or polls or the decades of activism by Native Americans to get the name changed. Instead he referenced a radical text otherwise known as “a dictionary.” Sincerely. Judge Lee ruled that since the name is a dictionary-defined slur, arguing that it is not a slur, as team owner Dan Snyder continues to do, is absurd.   Dan Snyder, seething and sweating behind closed doors, may not get it (this is a safe characterization because he is always seething and sweating); and team president Bruce Allen, brother of former US Senator George “Macaca” Allen, may pledge to appeal this ruling, but they are like half-mad generals braying orders on the battlefield long after the war has ended. Meanwhile, attorney Jesse Witten, who represented Amanda Blackhorse and her co-plaintiffs, called it “a victory for human dignity and for my courageous clients who have waited so long for this ruling.”  It is also a victory for Suzan Shown Harjo, the writer and activist of Cheyenne and Hodulgee Muscogee heritage who brought the first trademark suit against the team 25 years ago. I spoke to Ms. Harjo and she said, “What a glorious day. Point by point we won everything. We won every single point. The ruling recalls the way all the public officials called for the Confederate Flag to come down after the horrific church murders in Charleston. It is politicians and judges saying that racist symbols and hate speech are things of the past and in the public interest—not just the interests of Native people or African-Americans—we don’t want to take them into the future. This ruling is like that. It is inserting these big ideas of racism being against the public interest into the American Bloodstream.… I’m grinning so much my teeth hurts. I want to hug this judge.  In practice, this ruling means that the team is still allowed to use the name. However, there is now no legal protection that accompanies it. This means that the team can continue to use it, for now, but it also cannot sue anyone else who attempts to profit from their brand. In other words, we have entered the “South Park Zone.” It is now open season on bootleg merchandise. We will see the market flooded with everything from Confederate Flags with the team logo (you can guarantee this team now getting embraced by the Stars and Bars crowd) to R—-— toilet paper, and the team can’t do a damn thing. We’ll see how long the 28 other NFL owners, most of whom find Snyder to be about as charming as Lyme disease, put up with this kind of “brand degradation.”  Meanwhile, Wednesday, July 8, 2015, will stand as a proud day for Amanda Blackhorse, Suzan Harjo, and the original members of the American Indian Movement who stated that the issue of racist mascotry was inextricably intertwined with the so-called “real issues” facing Indian country. Dan Snyder and Bruce Allen seem committed to stand with the racist, Confederate-loving original owner of the team, George Preston Marshall. Yet while they stand in the past, time is moving on without them. Fans of the team should also move on until they change this shameful, harmful, and altogether anachronistic name."

Trump is plowing though all the politically correct crap and speaking his mind. I doubt he'll ever be president but he's opening discussion that needs to be said.  Further, a hero would fight to the death, not allow themselves to be captured. Is getting captured a sign of cowardness? NO! But it is not an act of heroism.  A hero accomplishes something positive. Getting captured is not positive. Not being a pilot able to evade being shot down is not a positive accomplishment.  And barbadosslim, we weren't given a choice.

I absolutely promise you that if the cops come and you just stand there with a hammer in your hand that you will never be fatally shot in the chest by law enforcement.   Even the most competent mental health workers will tell you that when dealing with a patient suffering from ""schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, prolonged post traumatic stress disorder, major depression, personality disorders, and otherwise was diagnosed as seriously mentally ill"" there is not playbook. There is no right and wrong way when handling every situation. Someone with those challenges actively in crisis is absolutely unpredictable if anything.  Multiple all of that by the fact the officers had no training at all on how to deal with this? Well, that's how we handle mental illness in this country, with law enforcement and incarceration. So sad.    Dupra could have used a Taser or pepper spray instead of killing her, Michelle’s mother says. Or police could have simply kept her in her home until trained help arrived.   Not going to google it now as I am ass tired. However, know that a sheriff in the US was basically letting his rich buddies do ride alongs. The thing is, the buddies were not observing, they were in body armor and armed with tasers and guns. Well, one of the rich numbnuts with no law training at all goes with them to serve a warrant. Things go as they do, suspect running, and the civilian playing cop pull his taser and fires hitting the suspect in the chest. Except the guy didn't grab the taser, he grabbed his 9mm and fired hitting the suspect. I believe his first word was ""ooops"".   now ain't that fun?!"

Some GMOs can encourage biodiversity, others can encourage monocultural, the exact same as ""natural"" foods. New GMOs can be harmful to humans, as can new ""natural"" foods.  There is absolutely no good, scientifically backed reason to put GMOs in a different group than ""natural"" foods.  Labeling foods with ""GMO"" is like giving equal time to climate deniers on news programs: it encourages the ignorant belief that is not supported by scientists. It confuses the consumer because it suggests to them that something that really makes no difference might actually make a difference.

Depending on the belief of the person doing the evaluating, a Catholic who adores the sacrament every day after attending daily mass could be a fanatic.  Or it could be based solely on political ideology -- anti abortion or opposition to gay marriage (both are pretty orthodox in Christianity) -- may mark one out as a fundamentalist.  Short of defining fanatic as ""pulling out a gun and shooting people "" which is kinda pointless as diagnostic criteria (like saying that the proof that you have cancer is that you just died of cancer) -- any definition of fanatic is going to be up to the political and social mores of the day and the area.  Daily mass is probably rare on Castro St.  Daily church meetings are normal in the South.  So if you moved a normal Southern Baptist from Mississippi to California, does his mental health status change? This also neglects the bigotry against other religions.  What if the person attending daily worship is Muslim?  Most popular opinion holds that the majority of terrorism comes from religious Muslims -- so a level of devotion that wouldn't be a big deal for a Christian or Jew or Buddhist might be mentally ill for a Muslim.  Not because the guy really wants to harm people, but because people think a religious Muslim is automatically a terrorist."

This terminology is not ISIS-specific, it's used by all Muslims. It's not an indicator of radicalization.  ISIS views themselves as followers of some sort of puritanical strain of Islam, they believe that the rest of the world is living for the worldy/materialistic and they have abandoned it for the here-after.

What it says is that it isn't about ""the details of the deal"" (emphasis mine). Much of the rhetoric against the deal is about how the ""holes"" in it give Iran a path to the bomb.

They're not the same thing.  If you're saying ""whoosh family"" you're referring to the taxonomic grouping of Whooshidae, which includes things from whishes to swoshes to threes.

You said a swish is a whoosh, which is not true unless you're okay with calling all members of the whoosh family whooshes, which means you'd call whishes, swoshes, and other sounds whooshes, too.

AnythingGoesNews,3cn987,ShaunaDorothy,1 point,Thu Jul 9 05:44:25 2015 UTC,"'What about insects? Do they have rights too?' Animal Liberation Front  by Alfie        08 Jul 2015  Before considering the issue of rights, let us first address the question ""What about insects?"". Strictly speaking, insects are small invertebrate animals of the class Insecta, having an adult stage characterized by three pairs of legs, a segmented body with three major divisions, and usually two pairs of wings. We'll adopt the looser definition, which includes similar invertebrate animals such as spiders, centipedes, and ticks.  Insects have a ganglionic nervous system, in contrast to the central nervous system of vertebrates. Such a system is characterized by local aggregates of neurons, called ganglia, that are associated with, and specialized for, the body segment with which they are co-located. There are interconnections between ganglia but these connections function not so much as a global integrating pathway, but rather for local segmental coordination. For example, the waves of leg motion that propagate along the body of a centipede are mediated by the intersegmental connections.  In some species the cephalic ganglia are large and complex enough to support very complex behavior (e.g., the lobster and octopus). The cuttlefish (not an insect but another invertebrate with a ganglionic nervous system) is claimed by some to be about as intelligent as a dog.  Insects are capable of primitive learning and do exhibit what many would characterize as intelligence. Spiders are known for their skills and craftiness; whether this can all be dismissed as instinct is arguable. Certainly, bees can learn in a limited way. When offered a reward from a perch of a certain color, they return first to perches of that color. They also learn the location of food and transmit that information to their colleagues. The learning, however, tends to be highly specialized and applicable to only limited domains.  In addition to a primitive mental life as described above, there is some evidence that insects can experience pain and suffering. The earthworm nervous system, for example, secretes an opiate substance when the earthworm is injured. Similar responses are seen in vertebrates and are generally accepted to be a mechanism for the attenuation of pain. On the other hand, the opiates are also implicated in functions not associated with analgesia, such as thermoregulation and appetite control. Nevertheless, the association of secretion with tissue injury is highly suggestive.  Earthworms also wriggle quite vigorously when impaled on a hook. In possible opposition to this are other observations. For example, the abdomen of a feeding wasp can be clipped off and the head may go on sucking (presumably in no distress?).  Singer quotes three criteria for deciding if an organism has the capacity to suffer from pain: 1) there are behavioral indications, 2) there is an appropriate nervous system, and 3) there is an evolutionary usefulness for the experience of pain. These criteria seem to satisfied for insects, if only in a primitive way.  Now we are equipped to tackle the issue of insect rights. First, one might argue that the issue is not so compelling as for other animals because industries are not built around the exploitation of insects. But this is untrue; large industries are built around honey production, silk production, and cochineal/carmine production, and, of course, mass insect death results from our use of insecticides. Even if the argument were true, it should not prevent us from attempting to be consistent in the application of our principles to all animals. Insects are a part of the Animal Kingdom and some special arguments would be required to exclude them from the general AR argument.  Some would draw a line at some level of complexity of the nervous system, e.g., only animals capable of operant conditioning need be enfranchised. Others may quarrel with this line and place it elsewhere. Some may postulate a scale of life with an ascending capacity to feel pain and suffer. They might also mark a cut-off on the scale, below which rights are not actively asserted. Is the cut-off above insects and the lower invertebrates? Or should there be no cut-off? This is one of the issues still being actively debated in the AR community.  People who strive to live without cruelty will attempt to push the line back as far as possible, giving the benefit of the doubt where there is doubt. Certainly, one can avoid unnecessary cruelty to insects.  The practical issues involved in enfranchising insects are dealt with in the following two questions. --DG  ""I want to realize brotherhood or identity not merely with the beings called human, but I want to realize identity with all life, even with such things as crawl upon earth."" --Mahatma Gandhi (statesman and philosopher)  ""What is it that should trace the insuperable line? ...The question is not, Can they reason? nor, Can they talk? but, Can they suffer?"" --Jeremy Bentham (philosopher)  See also: http://www.animalliberationfront.com/Philosophy/Morality/Biology/InsectAR.htm#faq39"

Giving money to Greece means giving it straight to the banks(ters). This money is not used for investments, it's just used to pay off debts. If there is no financial haircut (regarding the greece debt), bancruptcy is inevitable. Greece is in this spot, because they cooked the books and the other EU nations looked away. It was so obvious it was in the news multiple times. All, BEFORE the introduction of the Euro in Greece. In my opinion, the only thing able to save Greece is a massive financial haircut, but this means loosing a lot of money and the creditors are going to try anything to avoid it. In other words tax payers money is used to save the interest of the (private) creditors and the new creditors, european countries can't admit it."

We have made lawful to thee thy wives to whom thou hast paid their dowers; and those (slaves) whom thy right hand possesses out of the prisoners of war whom Allah has assigned to thee""  This is one of several personal-sounding verses ""from Allah"" narrated by Muhammad - in this case allowing himself a virtually unlimited supply of sex partners.  Other Muslims are restrained to four wives, but, following the example of their prophet, may also have sex with any number of slaves, as the following verse make clear:  Qur'an (23:5-6) - ""..who abstain from sex, except with those joined to them in the marriage bond, or (the captives) whom their right hands possess...""   This verse permits the slave-owner to have sex with his slaves.   Qur'an (4:24) - ""And all married women (are forbidden unto you) save those (captives) whom your right hands possess.""  Even sex with married slaves is permissible.  Qur'an (8:69) - ""But (now) enjoy what ye took in war, lawful and good""  A reference to war booty, of which slaves were a part.  The Muslim slave master may enjoy his ""catch"" because (according to verse 71) ""Allah gave you mastery over them.""  Additionally, the Hadith specifically mentions ""coitus interruptus"" (the act of removing one's genitals before ejaculation, aka. ""pulling out"") with slaves and captives. Both times it is mentioned, Allah's Apostle essentially explains that there is no reason for ""coitus interruptus"" because any soul that Allah has destined to exist, will exist regardless.  Volume 7, Book 62, Number 137: Narrated Abu Said Al-Khudri:  We got female captives in the war booty and we used to do coitus interruptus with them. So we asked Allah's Apostle about it and he said, ""Do you really do that?"" repeating the question thrice, ""There is no soul that is destined to exist but will come into existence, till the Day of Resurrection.""  Volume 3, Book 34, Number 432: Narrated Abu Said Al-Khudri:  that while he was sitting with Allah's Apostle he said, ""O Allah's Apostle! We get female captives as our share of booty, and we are interested in their prices, what is your opinion about coitus interrupt us?"" The Prophet said, ""Do you really do that? It is better for you not to do it. No soul that which Allah has destined to exist, but will surely come into existence."

Pretty much all of last year, the biggest stories were racial profiling and violence by police in New york City and in other urban areas, and yet recently we find that the south is some how more racist all because of a flag waving moron killing nine unarmed people in a church. Are we to concede that the real demon here is the weapon of choice rather than the hatred and intent to cause harm?"

It's a fact that the confederate flag represented those states the same way the swastika flag represented nazi Germany.  It's a fact that the confederate army fought to ensure that blacks continued to be enslaved, in fact that was their battlecry.   It's a fact that no amount of damage done by police compares to the harm done by confederate states against blacks. No cop ever sold a black man's 12 year old daughter or wife to a white land owning sexually depraved sadist like southerners did regularly.  It's a fact that the confederate states got their asses handed over in half.  It's also a fact that they lost the war and that the rich land owners fled like cowards and left their toothless whip crackers to fight it out for them until they were obliterated by moonshine and bullets.  It's a fact that the real confederate flag is a white rag on a stick.  It's a fact that you flunked basic American history.  It's also a fact that you really don't give a shit about black people and that not a single white 2nd ammendment and pro gun zealot will ever stand up to defend blacks, or whites, from being murdered by the tyrannical police departments.

However, the term may also refer to Australian-born persons who have Turkish parents or who have a Turkish ancestral background.  Turks first began to emigrate to Australia from the island of Cyprus for work in the 1940s, and then again when Turkish Cypriots were forced to leave their homes during the Cyprus conflict between 1963 and 1974. Furthermore, a large scale of Turkish immigrants began to arrive in Australia once a bilateral agreement was signed between Turkey and Australia in 1967. Recently, smaller groups of Turks have begun to immigrate to Australia from Bulgaria, Greece, Iraq, and the Republic of Macedonia.

AnythingGoesNews,3c53ic,sugarfreeeyecandy,2,Sun Jul 5 14:29:22 2015 UTC,"Thanks a lot buddy for showing your love for my article.  Well the difference between Ram and Storage is:  When talking about internal memory in mobile phones they usually mean Flash memory. This is the memory which holds your system software (operating system and such) and the applications. This memory is non-volatile, which means that data is retained even when power is switched off. That's what you want, otherwise your phone would become worthless if the battery is drained.  RAM is volatile memory, which means that the content is gone when the power is switched off. This is used by the OS and the applications to hold their temporary content, which becomes irrelevant if the device is switched off and/or which easily can be reconstructed.  Hope you understood.

Keyon Taylor and Maurice W. Miner-Gittens rented a U-haul truck and followed the USP delivery truck with a plan to rob the driver and steal the truck. Near Clermont Street, and Bailey Street Taylor got out of the U-Haul as Miner-Gittens waited behind. Taylor confronted the postal driver, pointed a gun at his head while demanding his wallet, shot him in the hand as the postal worker pushed the gun away, shot him in the arm, hit him on the head with his pistol, and demanded that the driver open ""the cash drawer."" The bleeding driver in shock from his wound and stunned by blows to the head could not understand. ""What cash drawer?"" Postal delivery trucks do not collect funds, and have nothing like a 'cash drawer.'  Taylor took the time to beat the postal worker in the back of the truck to vent his anger at the 'missing' cash drawer. Mines-Gittens followed behind in the rented U-haul. They had planned to unload the many packages in the truck with holiday merchandise and gifts. But the postal worker made it to the back door and opened it: he jumped to freedom running down the street as the U-haul driver observed him. People on Baily Street saw the postal worker in distress and went to his aide, and called for help. The postal worker was in his winter underwear without pants and bleeding from wounds to his arm and hand. Taylor drove off erratically in extreme anger, and crashed the postal truck into a snowbank near Clermont Street. He ran off on foot.  Mines-Gittens U-haul truck was spotted and reported by people who came to the injured man's aide. Mines-Gittens was stopped by police later that night in the rented U-haul. Keyon Taylor was able to avoid arrest until he was captured in January 2014.  Keyon Taylor, 22, was found guilty of assault on a federal employee, robbery of a U.S. Postal worker, kidnapping, attempted kidnapping, and use of a firearm in a crime of violence. A second man, Maurice Williams Miner-Gittens, 24, pled guilty to robbery and conspiracy, and possession of a firearm in February 2015; he has been sentenced to ten years in prison.  On Friday, June 19, 2015, a federal judge sentenced Keyon Taylot to 29 - 1/2 years in prison. Taylor is ordered by the court to pay $625,000 in restitution to the man he shot and robbed."

But just like any other country who's attacked America, you don't get to fly your flag over an American state house. That's just not how it works.  I'm not even going to touch the racist roots of the flag. It's perfectly clear that the flag is racist when it's own creator refers to it in the flag's description as ""The white man's flag"".

That's what it means to secede from the United States, renounce US citizenship, and form your own country. And they did have an invading army. That's what it means when you take an army from one country and cross the borders into another country without their permission.  So no, I'm not going to ""pay some respects"" to them. Let's say the head of my family sent out a letter to the rest of the family saying ""I don't think it's right for us to own people anymore."" If my uncle renounced the family, went to another family member's house, and killed them, that guy isn't owed any respect at all. He deserves what he gets.  You want to put that flag in a museum for it's historical importance, that's just fine. You want to fly it in your front yard, go for it. Nobody's stopping you.

If you treat prisoners like animals when they're in prison, we should not be surprised that they act like animals when they get out of prison. Duhh!!  We in the US invented the penitentiary form of imprisonment -- a comfortable room with a bed and a desk -- at the same time Europe was still throwing prisoners into literal dungeons. Our idea was to give prisoners a room where they could do ""penance"" (the root word of ""penitentiary"")  and contemplate their crime(s). We considered Europe's dungeons to be barbaric, medieval and ineffective.  Today, the Dutch give their prisoners a ""jail cell"" that we in the US would consider an apartment -- complete with a TV.  If you're a teenager in Denmark and commit the routine type of crimes that teenagers commit, you're likely to be ""sentenced"" to an island in the Caribbean. There you'll be housed in an apartment and given a monthly stipend to spend, free to roam about the island to shop, surf or to do what you want. Of course, you'll be encouraged (but not required) to talk to counselors. Danes are smart enough to realize that these youths are just teens and that removing the teens from their peers and criminal environment is the key to changing their behavior, and that locking the criminal teen into a cage/prison will accomplish nothing.  Can you imagine such common-sense policies here in the US? What would our corporate-funded politicians and mass media say?  Our country worships greed, money and ""our economy."" 200 years ago we were the radicals pushing sane policies of human rights. Today we seek an ""eye for an eye"" (a concept Christ refuted) and are the medieval barbarians. :("

AnythingGoesNews,3b79ia,Beowulf891,0,Fri Jun 26 20:59:56 2015 UTC,"? you have to ban speech to ban racism. Racism is an idea. This is really such a dumb cause to stand up for I don't quite understand why you don't just go fight for some other cause. Racism is more than just black people having civil rights. It's a deeply laid ground of ideas and beliefs likened to society by the power of the government. It's really unnecessary for you to fight for this specific case of freedom of speech, it's helping nobody and supporting the system of racism that has been in place for hundreds of years in america"
AnythingGoesNews,3b79ia,furretfan450,2,Fri Jun 26 21:12:29 2015 UTC,freedom of speech includes the freedom to hate. you are allowed to think what you want. its your actions you need to be careful of. hating someone is not the same as shooting someone you hate.

People died under it to defend what they believed in, a VAAAAAST majority of which were NOT slave owners. If a man wants the flag to rub all over his ass and junk, what right do you have to deny him that? It's ignorant shits like you who are the reason the US has gone batshit stupid over something that had nothing to do with the Charleston shooting."

Are you actually reading the news or just making up your own stories?"
AnythingGoesNews,3b79ia,furretfan450,1 point,Fri Jun 26 21:57:28 2015 UTC,"The war was fought over what rights that states had to govern its civilians. This is fucking elementary school stuff, idiot. Simplified, the Confederate States wanted the right to make their own laws. They wanted to be a group of their own governed states, not a single country united under one rule of law. There's A LOT more to the Civil War than just slaves."

This, our new government, is the first, in the history of the world, based upon this great physical, philosophical, and moral truth."" - The Vice President of the Confederate States of America.  This is an exerpt from the Cornerstone speech. I'm not taking a position on the cop firing, but it is clear that the South seperated because of slavery. Not state's rights.   The only major rights that the Confederate Constitution gave to states was the right to tax ships and impeach federal officers and judges. It did however take away a state's right to ban slavery and banned them from allowing immigrants to vote."

AnythingGoesNews,3b79ia,furretfan450,2,Sat Jun 27 00:35:27 2015 UTC,"Folks, the first amendment means being able to say what you want without criminal penalties.  It doesn't mean no consequences.  If you work at McDonald's and post ""Fuck Mickey D's"" on your social media, the clown is well within his rights to tell you to hit the road.  If you do or say something that affects your fitness for duty, the police department will absolutely fire you.  This cop arrests a black guy for armed robbery next week and has to testify that he observed the accused leaving the scene of the crime with a weapon in hand and a sack of money with a dollar sign on it.  During cross examination the defense attorney slaps this photo in front of judge and jury and asks, ""Are you sure you didn't just want to see an innocent black man go to jail?""  Why worry about that eventuality?  Why not tell this guy to go find a different job, and hire one of the candidates lined up around the block who does not have this problem.  I get it.  It's just underpants.  And that's why this Einstein shouldn't have thought they were important enough to share with the whole world."

This was a speech she gave against amending the constitution to make marriage defined as between one man and one woman. How one can turn that into speaking out against gay marriage, when she made no mention of it at all, seems disingenuous. She doesn't speak out against gay marriage she, politically, avoids the discussion altogether by saying that there is no reason for the amendment because the laws already allow the states to ignore marriages from other states.  I don't like her, and won't vote for her, and this speech was clearly political fence sitting. But let's be honest about what's going on rather than taking comments out of context to make someone look like they were supporting something they were not."
