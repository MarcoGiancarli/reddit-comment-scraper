mlb,3e3nxw,fakeshits,0,Tue Jul 21 18:34:00 2015 UTC,I don't like Roger Clemens.
mlb,3e3nxw,chrisgond,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:30:31 2015 UTC,Does anyone? Hes right up there with Barry Bonds and curt schilling in terms of likeable personalities.
mlb,3dyzwr,keep_pounding_412,5,Mon Jul 20 18:00:14 2015 UTC,How do you hit a walk off in the sixth inning?
mlb,3dyzwr,Jasonp359,3,Mon Jul 20 23:20:20 2015 UTC,Was wondering the same thing. Maybe the games were called for weather?
mlb,3dyzwr,SerialReapist,3,Tue Jul 21 01:01:44 2015 UTC,Found the 1952 game:  http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/1952/B08020NY11952.htm  It says at the end of the box score that the game was called due to rain. I guess it still counts as a walk-off....
mlb,3dyzwr,dhork,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:16:11 2015 UTC,It doesn't count games before 73
mlb,3dyzwr,joethehoe27,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:26:26 2015 UTC,On that section it specifically states 1948 and 1952
mlb,3dyzwr,SerialReapist,3,Tue Jul 21 18:43:14 2015 UTC,Surprised to see St. Louis towards the top of most walk offs allowed. Not surprised to see the Mets at No. 1
mlb,3dyzwr,mustangswon1,2,Mon Jul 20 18:17:52 2015 UTC,I wish our offense now was even a quarter of how good those 90s teams were.
mlb,3dyk8l,lift_ticket83,5,Mon Jul 20 16:11:17 2015 UTC,So that's how Sosa got all his juice...
mlb,3dyt1a,fakeshits,6,Mon Jul 20 17:12:53 2015 UTC,"I was at that game, it was an amazing finish to an amazing tournament.  Great baseball all around."
mlb,3dyt1a,Compley,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:23:52 2015 UTC,"Lucky, I couldn't find tickets. The sales for the games worked kinda funny."
mlb,3dyt1a,BombDisposalBob,4,Mon Jul 20 23:28:01 2015 UTC,crazy way for a game to end. cool.
mlb,3dyt1a,seapants,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:07:46 2015 UTC,Damn Canadians
mlb,3dyt1a,HaxorusOG,-5,Tue Jul 21 03:17:50 2015 UTC,Surprised?
mlb,3dyt1a,creativerecs,4,Mon Jul 20 22:07:21 2015 UTC,I mean yeah. How many years in a row have we won the World Series? You'd think the Pan Am games would be easy.
mlb,3dw8q6,Khajitoverlord,38,Mon Jul 20 01:31:29 2015 UTC,"Damn, 10 hits and only 1 run!? So they are like storm troopers that can actually hit something but nothing that will do any damage?"
mlb,3dw8q6,statsjunkie,19,Mon Jul 20 02:55:33 2015 UTC,Set bats to STUN
mlb,3dw8q6,Rdubya44,7,Mon Jul 20 08:43:34 2015 UTC,"my favorite part was the opening credits, when they called Kershaw, the Evil Sith Lord Kershaw.  They did a great job the whole day."
mlb,3dw8q6,frugalwater,5,Mon Jul 20 10:38:39 2015 UTC,That was hilarious! I liked that Darth Maul won the presidents race. The whole day was great
mlb,3dw8q6,drewski3420,6,Mon Jul 20 14:39:58 2015 UTC,Braves had star wars day and Ryan Howard's picture was jobba the hutt. I thought that was appropriate.
mlb,3dw8q6,tysole,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:19:53 2015 UTC,Fat with too much money? Sounds about right.
mlb,3dw8q6,killerpikachu33,6,Tue Jul 21 01:02:28 2015 UTC,Grienke must've been Vader today then... He was dominant!
mlb,3dw8q6,Jackman_Bingo,2,Mon Jul 20 03:17:51 2015 UTC,He was.  Scherzer was Obi-wan.  Totally appropriate.
mlb,3dw8q6,capisill88,3,Tue Jul 21 21:49:14 2015 UTC,It's things like this that make me love baseball. Things that none of my baseball hater friends will ever understand.
mlb,3dw8q6,AllThatJellyNoToast,3,Mon Jul 20 12:29:58 2015 UTC,"as much as i hate the nats, i love that they do cool stuff like this. Between this and the president's race, watching a game there is always entertaining"
mlb,3dw8q6,inoucit,2,Mon Jul 20 18:28:12 2015 UTC,Does every team have a Star Wars night?
mlb,3dw8q6,cerebralshrike,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:34:01 2015 UTC,Star Wars night is coming to Globe Life soon. I gotta get tickets!
mlb,3dw8q6,Quesly,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:16:02 2015 UTC,the john williams music playing the whole game was a really nice touch
mlb,3dw8q6,Horsesaredumb,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:08:58 2015 UTC,Angels did the same thing for the A's; they even put the glasses on the Sogard Stormtrooper.  Oh and your stormtroopers had names; ours were serial numbers lol
mlb,3dw8q6,bradd93,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:34:43 2015 UTC,Kershaw is a master in the Force Choke.
mlb,3dw8q6,ThePaulitician,0,Mon Jul 20 14:41:41 2015 UTC,"It's good that they used that picture for Puig... All he did was strikeout and run back into the dugout until the side was retired, much like a robot."
mlb,3dw8q6,Clash21,3,Mon Jul 20 16:29:22 2015 UTC,Oh you mean besides the two run RBI single he had? Yeah okay
mlb,3dw8q6,tysole,2,Mon Jul 20 19:12:32 2015 UTC,Storm Troopers aren't robots
mlb,3dw8q6,MustBeNice,-3,Tue Jul 21 01:03:52 2015 UTC,"Guys remember when Puig was good? Yeah, those were the days."
mlb,3dw8q6,sarahcasarah,-13,Mon Jul 20 10:36:25 2015 UTC,"Ryan Howard got Jobba a few weeks back. They're reminding me of middle school girls, those Nats. Are they still doing obnoxious pop songs for the opposing team's warm up?"
mlb,3e0032,wizkids121,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:17:29 2015 UTC,"Could likely add David Price and Yoenis Cespedes into this mix now. Marlon Byrd, Jim Johnson as well."
mlb,3e0032,enigma2U,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:51:50 2015 UTC,Entire Braves organization..
mlb,3dyey7,fakeshits,2,Mon Jul 20 15:33:01 2015 UTC,"Love him or hate him, from Jordan to Cobb, to Ruth, and Tiger, Bonds, and Lebron, the greatest of all time have often been so confident in their ability that everyone says they're assholes. At the end of their careers the numbers spoke for themselves. Harper could be in their crowd when he's done, and he'll be right for saying this. To him, Greinke may not be that tough to beat at the plate. Kid has an generationally legendary amount of ability. Let's just hope he doesn't go the way of Griffey and end up with a career shortened by injuries."
mlb,3dyey7,Kenny_Login,3,Mon Jul 20 16:58:01 2015 UTC,you mean lets hope he doesnt end up with 600+ homers??? He would be extremely lucky to come anywhere close to griffey.
mlb,3dyey7,Jaylaw,2,Mon Jul 20 21:02:06 2015 UTC,"I'm an O's fan and we have a pseudo - rivalry with the Nats. People always cheer extra loud when he gets called out (specifically strike outs). A lot of the baltimore fan base can't stand him.   Personally, I find him to be a bit of an asshole, but I'd love to have him on my team...attitude and all."
