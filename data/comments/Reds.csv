Reds,3e580s,ukfan693,3,Wed Jul 22 01:28:46 2015 UTC,According to the broadcast it was a crew chief review
Reds,3e580s,DoDaDrew,2,Wed Jul 22 02:07:00 2015 UTC,"I didn't catch that live, no idea what happened.  Gameday doesn't mention a triple."
Reds,3e580s,cincyfan04,11,Wed Jul 22 01:44:38 2015 UTC,"Cubs hit a ball to LF. Ball appears to hit the wall and come back in. Fans were reaching for it. Batter ends up at 3rd.   Umpires talk about it. Leave the guy at 3rd.   Price comes out and says ""hey, looks like a fan touched it. Isn't that a Ground rule double?"" Ump says we will look at it.   They look at it. Decide it would have gone OVER the wall of the fan hadn't interfered and award the batter home.   Bryan Price goes ape shit because he now looks stupid. Baseball version of an own goal. Umpire refuse to eject him. Game continues."
Reds,3e580s,thehulk0560,13,Wed Jul 22 02:13:48 2015 UTC,Its like they left him in as more of a punishment than ejecting him.

Reds,3e2d9t,whatsout,9,Tue Jul 21 16:45:09 2015 UTC,Pretty slick. I'm going to miss this if we actually manage to find a trade partner.
Reds,3e2d9t,mbertels,8,Tue Jul 21 13:23:57 2015 UTC,I think BP is pretty far down the list of potential trades.
Reds,3e2d9t,Sideonecincy,2,Tue Jul 21 15:05:21 2015 UTC,i think he'd be an add on to a Leake or Cueto trade to dump salary and lower the cost for the trade partner.
Reds,3e2d9t,Vitapak,4,Tue Jul 21 15:38:50 2015 UTC,You guys do understand that if Brandon doesn't want to leave he doesn't have to because he has 10/5 rights
Reds,3e2d9t,ice_veins,4,Tue Jul 21 16:06:13 2015 UTC,"Yes but I think if he gets offered a team that's ""in it"" now he'd rather be there than stuck on a rebuilding team."
Reds,3e2d9t,Vitapak,3,Tue Jul 21 17:27:06 2015 UTC,"I don't think so. Who is contending that needs a starting 2B? Not the Dodgers. Not Toronto. Not Houston. Maybe KC, or the Yankees.   BP isn't going to ride the bench. Even on a championship team. So maybe we package him with a pitcher (Cueto) and send him to NY (sound familiar?). That's like the only way I see Phillips leaving Cincinnati before his contract ends."
Reds,3e2d9t,thehulk0560,3,Tue Jul 21 21:44:05 2015 UTC,"I know its all speculation, but according to recent trade rumors, they are trying to package Bruce or Byrd with Cueto or Leake. We will see soon enough"
Reds,3e2d9t,Sideonecincy,2,Tue Jul 21 15:57:19 2015 UTC,I'm not saying he will or won't go...but hypothetically if he does it'd be with them as a salary dump.

Reds,3dyamz,tehjarvis,14,Mon Jul 20 15:01:00 2015 UTC,"Marty is just annoyed at how shitty this organization has been the past few years. Wrong contracts to wrong players, wrong coaching decisions, wrong everything. He has a right to bitch about it just like we do. The Reds have been making the wrong moves for quite some time."
Reds,3dyamz,easymac11,5,Mon Jul 20 17:24:00 2015 UTC,"The people he has criticized harshly aren't the leadership, they are the players. At least once a year he calls them collectively stupid. One night he wasn't even working, but Cozart made an error so he had to call in to get this comment on air: “Honest to goodness, we have seen more bad decisions in the last few days and you truly wonder about the intellect, the baseball intellect of some of these players wearing a Reds uniform.”  No, he doesn't dislike the leadership or ownership. This guy survived the entire Marge Schott era. He had Schott chastising him for having dinner with someone she didn't like. I can't even imagine what went on that we don't know about, but I'm sure Marty is much happier with current ownership.   Even when Marty shits on a contract, he does it by blaming the player. ""Votto needs to be more aggressive, he's not being paid to walk."" That kinda shit."
Reds,3dyamz,vl06,2,Mon Jul 20 20:20:45 2015 UTC,Players play the game. Players make the big bucks. Players right now suck.
Reds,3dyamz,easymac11,6,Mon Jul 20 21:16:08 2015 UTC,"I agree with the premise of the article, and I feel like Marty has been a surly curmudgeon since Nuxy left the booth. Marty has been acerbic since Dunner, Griff and Kearns first started together. You can say he's the HOFer and earned his keep, to that I say, has Vin Scully approached his job with anything but class or ever turned away Dodgers fans, either old or new? No, the differences is that Marty self promotes himselfand his dated views of baseball and while constantly criticizing players the Reds put out there; Vin Scully is pure class and a Dodgers advocate and face to the fans in times of good and plenty. I miss Nuxy, I am no fan of Marty."
Reds,3dyamz,UrbanAppalachian,4,Tue Jul 21 00:23:29 2015 UTC,"My theory is that Marty is still the way he was, but working with the much older announcer partner Nuxhall kept him feeling young and lighthearted. Now his partners are all younger than he is and this constantly reminds him of how things are not like they used to be."
Reds,3dyamz,excoriator,16,Tue Jul 21 00:41:10 2015 UTC,If the team was 20 games over .500 nobody would give a shit.  Marty is fine and has earned his keep.
Reds,3dyamz,roach8101,9,Mon Jul 20 16:57:07 2015 UTC,"Yeah, he's earned what he's been paid each year like you and me. That doesn't mean he's entitled to keep his job for life. And people have complained about Marty almost as much as they've praised him throughout his entire career. It's not new or limited to losing seasons.   The difference now is that there's not many people left that are praising him. I want to like the guy for nostalgia reasons, but he's becoming harder and harder to listen to each year. Then I hear announcers for another team that are upbeat and entertaining regardless of how their team is performing in that game or the season... and I want that for our games."
Reds,3dyamz,vl06,2,Mon Jul 20 20:32:15 2015 UTC,"Seriously, if he liked everybody they would complain that he is a kiss ass."
Reds,3dyamz,jorio,7,Mon Jul 20 19:47:30 2015 UTC,Marty changed after he got into the Hall. He talks like he's going to die before he sees anything good and it's everyone else's fault. Well I would like to see something good and that is a new commentator. Marty is just too old to do this.
Reds,3dyamz,reagan-nomics,5,Mon Jul 20 18:54:43 2015 UTC,"The game changed. Marty didn't. Now he has tenure and a plaque in Cooperstown, so we're stuck with him."

Reds,3dyamz,Golden_Smog,2,Mon Jul 20 21:15:31 2015 UTC,"I grew up listening to Marty and Joe, and I have to say it just pains me to listen to Marty these days. The never ending disdain and contempt that just drips from his voice, as if he's somehow owed a World Series performance gets harder and harder to listen to.  I suppose he's earned some of that, and I do appreciate that he's not a total Homer of an announcer, but he's gone so far off balance with his bitterness it makes me, sadly, look forward to the times he takes away from the mic."
Reds,3dyamz,teemark,3,Tue Jul 21 00:58:31 2015 UTC,"Marty is the epitome of Cincinnati. His attitude reflects the way most sports fans in Cincinnati feel. If our teams suck we get pissed. If our players suck we get pissed. Now we think our announcers suck, so we're getting pissed."
Reds,3dyamz,thehulk0560,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:22:42 2015 UTC,"I understand Marty seems to be getting a bit more hard to listen to as time goes on, but I still really enjoy listening to most of the broadcasters in Cincinnati personally. I'm usually watching on Fox Sports Ohio instead of the radio though. I can't get a good radio signal (just outside of Charleston, WV)"
Reds,3dzcej,FlyingMammothHunter,2,Mon Jul 20 19:28:23 2015 UTC,This might be a silly question but can't you just call them and have them hold the tickets until tomorrow?
Reds,3dzcej,xeniad2003,2,Mon Jul 20 20:33:27 2015 UTC,The only number I could find was still for reds ticketmaster (off the reds website) and it appeared to still carry the fees
Reds,3dzcej,xeniad2003,4,Mon Jul 20 21:08:11 2015 UTC,Any reason why you can't just by them on the way into the game tomorrow? It won't be sold out. There is a $5 lot west of Paul brown stadium. Not sure how much fees are for tix.

He always had good years though.  He later became a Republican Senator from Kentucky but the less said about that, the better.  Jay was the first Little League player to advance to the major leagues.  He was also the first ""bonus baby"" players in the major leagues.  In 1961, Jay won 21 games (the first Red to win 20 since Ewell Blackwell in 1947), tied for the league lead in wins and shutouts, as the Reds surged to their first National League pennant since 1940. However, the Reds faced a powerful New York Yankees that won 109 games and featured Roger Maris, Mickey Mantle and Whitey Ford, as the Reds lost in five game. However, the lone Reds' win occurred in Game 2, a 6-2 victory as Jay threw a complete-game four-hitter at Yankee Stadium."

Reds,3dvmzi,excoriator,3,Mon Jul 20 00:37:57 2015 UTC,"You tell me. Your posts implied you wanted to do a deal now, any deal, before players get hurt and become untradable."

Reds,3du5pr,mtndewgood,3,Sun Jul 19 22:05:42 2015 UTC,Pretty sure Cingrani will start.  Let's put it this way: if Cingrani doesn't start it means Walt kept Leake and Cueto and it won't matter who gets called up.

Reds,3du5pr,Bhunt49,3,Sun Jul 19 21:05:05 2015 UTC,Franconia does things that make sense.
Reds,3du5pr,thehulk0560,5,Sun Jul 19 21:07:07 2015 UTC,"I am confused which happens often, I admit. If Reds senior management have made a decision to trade starters, and you have to think they have, why are we running these people out there to play after the All-Star break risking injury? If you're going full fire sale to rebuild like the Astros 2-3 years ago, why not pull the trigger? Is one more conditional pick or career minor leaguer to sweeten the deal going to make a big difference? Doesn't Walt know what he wants at this point? How much more can you get by waiting another day or two?"
Reds,3du5pr,UrbanAppalachian,2,Sun Jul 19 21:00:23 2015 UTC,"It's all about negotiating. Sure Walt knows what HE wants, but the other team probably won't give in that easily. So it's like a game of chicken to the deadline.   Goodnews is nobody else has been traded (ie Hamels) so it doesn't appear that we are missing out on anything....yet."
Reds,3du5pr,thehulk0560,2,Sun Jul 19 21:11:22 2015 UTC,"My guess is the rumor thread at the mothership isn't far from the truth, that Bob still thinks they're one or two pieces from contending. Waiting to get the right pieces."
Reds,3du5pr,icyone,2,Sun Jul 19 21:03:54 2015 UTC,"I don't disagree. While healthy, I feel this team is a couple of pieces away... The problem lies in either the ownership not wanting or not being able to increase the payroll to be able to retain key guys and add the necessary pieces...  Basically, if we were a bigger market team with a bigger budget, we would be in decent shape."
Reds,3du5pr,maniacalxmatt,2,Sun Jul 19 21:11:18 2015 UTC,"This team is easily a half dozen pieces from competing. And I don't mean big name big money pieces, I just mean major league pieces. You've got a completely garbage bullpen. The top 2 starters will not be here next year but the bottom 2 guys in the rotation aren't even ready now and there's no one in the farm more ready than them.  More importantly, however, the farm hitting instruction has to change and that takes time to take effect, so you've got a while before you bring up guys who can hit without having to hit homers."
Reds,3du5pr,icyone,3,Sun Jul 19 21:16:37 2015 UTC,The team could really use a walkoff from a morale perspective
Reds,3du5pr,Dent18,3,Sun Jul 19 20:58:47 2015 UTC,"I am a fucking moron. I had the trade thread pulled up thinking it was the game day thread. Was thinking to myself ""where the hell is everyone..."""

Reds,3drd6y,KeepinItOneHunda,8,Sat Jul 18 18:44:41 2015 UTC,"It's really going to depend on the park and what the normal cost for tickets are sold for at your teams games.  GABP a are pretty cheap tickets in general, so the price probably weren't as steep as say it was at Dodger Stadium.  If you don't have season tickets or some type of contact to get tickets, you are going to have to resort to stub hub or something like it, and that's where it's going to get pretty costly.  Especially in California."
Reds,3drd6y,TurnDownElliot,7,Sat Jul 18 19:38:31 2015 UTC,My buddy got tickets to the derby for around 160 each I believe.
Reds,3drd6y,milez1305,3,Sat Jul 18 19:48:49 2015 UTC,My derby tickets in right center field were $245 face value. ASG in the same spot were $255.

Me, I had on my gray reds hat with the red brim and was sitting with my mom, about six seats in from the center field side of the section."

Reds,3drd6y,PF_Flyers,5,Sat Jul 18 21:39:40 2015 UTC,I checked an hour before the ASG started and the cheapest available on stubhub was $260ish. SRO would have been cheaper but none were listed. So if you start shopping early I'm sure you could get them for a lot cheaper. Not sure of HRD but I know several people that went that wouldn't have paid an arm and a leg
Reds,3drd6y,Ozzyo520,2,Sat Jul 18 20:20:30 2015 UTC,Thanks for this info!
Reds,3drd6y,redlegsfan21,2,Sat Jul 18 21:50:00 2015 UTC,"Well, I was shopping around since April and through June 30th, nothing broke $500 except SRO and bleachers. As the forecast for rain came, ticket prices started to drop. I watched the same thing happen in Minneapolis last year as I was preparing for this years game. The closer to the game, the more ticket prices drop. I would wait til about a week before but set yourself a limit and go for it when you see that price."
Reds,3drd6y,sully3333,3,Sun Jul 19 03:36:51 2015 UTC,I was able to get seats in the third row of right field for $275 each the night before the Home Run Derby.
Reds,3drd6y,Throwwawaycamera,3,Sun Jul 19 02:42:04 2015 UTC,I bought some nose bleeds at the box office the day before the derby and paid $120. Stubhub had a lot of tickets left but the same section I sat in was going for $180 on stubhub.
Reds,3drd6y,whitegrb,2,Sun Jul 19 13:34:56 2015 UTC,"I went through vividseats.com and bought tickets for just the game itself, but they had the option for doing everything-Sunday events, HR Derby, and Game-as well. I bought SRO, but they had seats too. It will probably be expensive, but definitely worth it in my opinion. I was not even 2 months old the last time the ASG was in Cincy and playing those odds again, I'll be in my 50s or 60s the next time."

At GABP seats that are $15 during normal season were $250+ for the ASG. $250 normal seats (best in the park) were $2,000+ during ASG. These of course are 2nd hand ticket prices."

Reds,3dr82k,Monkeyfeng,4,Sun Jul 19 00:32:25 2015 UTC,Whaaaaat trade rumors about Smiley are these national broadcast turds talking about?!
Reds,3dr82k,BigRedJon,5,Sat Jul 18 23:42:27 2015 UTC,"Not so sure I understand it either. If Mes were healthy, you've still got Barnswallow to backup, and Pena's good value right now. But as is, trading Pena better come with a complete rebuild, even Frazier."
Reds,3dr82k,icyone,3,Sat Jul 18 23:46:19 2015 UTC,"I doubt very much that Pena has any trade value at all. We've seen him play a lot the last two years and he's had some nice stretches, but ultimately he's a backup catcher with zero power. And he's a free agent at the end of the year.  I have a hard time believing you're going to find a team willing to expend any resources at the deadline on a rental Brayan Pena."
Reds,3dr82k,BigRedJon,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:57:59 2015 UTC,"He's getting what, 2 mil, is better than most of our starters at the plate, and can play both first and catcher? He'd be a strong bench player for a team looking to shore up. Cheap for the buyer, but the Reds could snag a non-catching prospect."
Reds,3dr82k,icyone,3,Sun Jul 19 00:06:42 2015 UTC,"He has a .676 OPS. That's not good at the plate. If he's tradeable, it'd be money dump only, or PTBNL. So essentially for nothing."
Reds,3dr82k,BigRedJon,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:18:33 2015 UTC,"That's why I said if it comes to that it has to be a total rebuild. His OPS is better than BP and Billy, and his OBP is second only to Votto. Insisting that if you can't hit for power that you aren't good at the plate is the Reds way, though."
Reds,3dr82k,icyone,3,Sun Jul 19 00:24:59 2015 UTC,Hamilton and BP aren't good at the plate either though...   and Pena's a good value right now.   I'm just telling you he's not.
Reds,3dr82k,BigRedJon,3,Sun Jul 19 00:34:40 2015 UTC,"Peña is not good at the plate and never has been.  There literally was a FanGraphs article that kept on repeating ""Brayan Peña is not a good hitter"" last year.    EDIT:  Found it"
