radiocontrol,3e2xc1,Jaracer64,4,Tue Jul 21 19:02:13 2015 UTC,"Weight is the enemy of planes (generally). If you crash hard enough it'll just ""liquefy"" whatever the tape is protecting anyway. Weight also increases momentum, which makes crashes more break-y.  I would suggest removing the tape and maybe having a few pieces strategically (like if it belly-lands, a single strip along the bottom).  Now that I look at it, do you have the LiPo hanging off the bottom? That's a bad idea, any punctures upon landing will burn your plane down.   I would suggest: build it as light as possible, this will make the plane perform much better, and be less likely to crash. It'll also be easier to repair without several layers."

Carve down the balsa to match the inside diameter of the carbon tube and leave the plywood a little larger to match the outside diameter.  Glue this assembly to the carbon tube.  You can drill a few holes straight through and add some small carbon rods to increase the strength a bit.  Bolt the X mount to the plywood and you are good to go.  Be aware you will probably need right-thrust and down-thrust.  You can do this easily with washers mounted under the x mount.

I think it could handle the amp load, but solder joints are generally pretty brittle.  If you put any force on the connectors, they could break.  I would expect it to experience plenty of force in use, so I would prefer a connector that used a good bit of cable to allow some shock absorption.  Other than that, I wouldn't worry too much about current draw.  I'm sure you'll pick a more than sufficient wire size."

As for the improvement, again for mobile devices - a single column layout.  the 3 wide grid is perfect for desktop and landscape tablet, but is too cramped on phone.

Fly it until it cuts out (or you feel it's getting too slow), then check the battery voltage with a volt meter. If it's anywhere around 3.8V, you're good to go.  If it's lower, you should put a maintenance charge on it (get it back up to 3.8V).  If it's much more than 3.8V, you should consider flying some more. :D  If you don't have a lipo voltage checker, you should consider getting one. They're dirt cheap and very handy.

If it would qualify for someone to call 911, then it's time to immediately abort the mission, return to base, land and cease all operations. Unless authorized to be there, FPV pilots have no business at all being in the air near an emergency situation.

If even 1 drone hits 1 plane, the relative danger of a drone well outweighs a bird. And they ground the planes to make sure that 1 drone hit doesn't happen, because that's endangering more lives."
radiocontrol,3duvej,shodanx,-2,Mon Jul 20 14:35:51 2015 UTC,"RC aircraft are very very small but so are normal aircraft and the sky is very very big. That means from the get go, chances of collisions are tiny.   Then you have the RC pilot, who can use flightradar24.com to warn of nearby aircraft and get out of the way as needed. He doesn't want his toy damaged anymore than the bird wants to get sucked in.  Birds, being very numerous, get sucked in very often. I often have to deal with engines full of stinky ground meat and even though they are more damaging to aircraft than a rc aircraft ingestion, they still don't cause enough damage to risk the safety of the passengers."

That blows the carbon seals and often causes and internal engine fire.  Harder things turns to dust and have much less effect on the rest of the engine.  Bird strikes often trip the excess vibration sensors and force and immediate engine shutdown. Something much less likely in case of drone ingestion."

radiocontrol,3duvej,shodanx,1 point,Mon Jul 20 07:16:12 2015 UTC,"Propellers and helicopter rotors are extremely strongs, they can hit the ground several times without breaking. They would pulverize a rc aircraft with ease and only need superficial repairs. Turbine engines are by far the most vulnerable aircraft part to a drone but that still would not be a danger to the passengers.  As for airfoil impact, at worst the paint would be scratched (because you don't do firefighting at high speeds)"

People who run 2wd trucks have excellent control over their vehicles and are looking for a challenge when driving.

Also remember to monitor your breathing. This is surprisingly important when dealing with our shaky limbs. Lol.
radiocontrol,3drxes,Doctor_Murderstein,2,Sun Jul 19 02:47:14 2015 UTC,"I am would suggest twisting the wire together and tying it with a bit of copper (pulled out of other wire) to hold it. The I would put the soldering iron on the table with a weight on it so it doesn't move. Clip the wires into the helping hands and adjust the hands to provide contact with the iron. Use flux, it makes life so much easier. Apply solder using hands then move the iron away when done.   This is how I do fine or tricky stuff because the iron doesn't move and the resistance of the helping hands makes them hard to bump.   Best of luck!"

radiocontrol,3dsi6w,Jamaican_In_NY,3,Sun Jul 19 01:01:08 2015 UTC,"""Two of the drones pursued our lead plane. One underneath, one actually flying over the top,"" Miller told NBC's Gadi Schwartz.   And   The fire began near the Interstate 15, the main highway between Los Angeles and Las Vegas, at around 2:50 p.m. Friday but was fueled by hot winds gusting at 40 mph and quickly grew. Eighteen vehicles and two big rigs were set ablaze and destroyed after the fast-moving fire jumped the freeway.   Are there hobbyist drones that can take 40mph wind gusts and chase a full scale plane? The plane in the video looked like it was one of them modified DC-10s, which I think takes off at something like 150mph, and so will fly I guess closer to 200mph?   Not to say that the news report is false, but there are no pictures and I would really like to know what kind of ""drone"" can fly in those kinds of conditions."
radiocontrol,3dsi6w,theony,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:16:51 2015 UTC,"I can't comment on exactly what was flying, but usually there's a smaller plane or helicopter coordinating the bombers. The quote says lead plane. It could be anything.  It doesn't mention anything specific about the ""drones"", but if it's hanging with full size I'd say they were fixed wing. I've never seen a Phantom do more than 40 or 50. There's some custom builds running 6s+ that appear to be capable of much more but they are the minority for sure."
radiocontrol,3dsi6w,92PathSE,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:36:49 2015 UTC,"Ah that makes more sense, could be slower.   The ""chase drone"" will still have to be pretty zippy though.

radiocontrol,3dlsxi,Websurger,5,Fri Jul 17 08:41:45 2015 UTC,Yup. 18 and 16 scale have a tiny hex. 10 scale and up have either a 12 or 17mm Hex. Usually you'll find the 12 mm hex on rtr trucks like traxxas associated and the like. The racing truggys and buggys 8 scale usually have the large 17mm Hex and a large nut that holds it all together like the Baja 5b.

radiocontrol,3dlsxi,rcpongo,2,Fri Jul 17 14:45:45 2015 UTC,"Subject says wheels, but post says tires, so I'm not sure which one (or both) your asking about.  Tires are universal. As in a tire made for a certain wheel size will fit any wheel of that size.  Wheels are not necessarily universal. Even though they may be the right size, and even the right mounting (hex vs pin), the offset may be different, resulting in a narrower or wider car.  Wider isn't necessarily bad (unless you're racing and have width limits, or the tires end up hitting the body), but you don't want to end up narrower, because that can cause the reinforcing webs inside some wheels to interfere with the suspension parts on certain vehicles."

But since you're essentially 'new' I think this plane is not good for you. Here's why: It's old: The motors could be seized and may need to be completely disassembled and soaked just to get good compression. The servos and all related electronics are old and outdated, and will give you headaches that will likely only cost you more money.  Nowadays it's very cheap to get a quality entry level setup at the right price. If you do a little research you can find the right setup, ready to fly for your budget. For instance, the Ready to Fly (RTF) E-Flite Apprentice S 15e (Germany Link) comes with everything you need, including battery and charger, for another 100 bucks or so. You would need to spend at least another 100 bucks if you buy the plane from your friends. So why not spend it on something that is new technology and is perfect for your needs? The transmitter (controller) that comes with the apprentice will also work with all ""bind and fly"" models that use spektrum - which would be very useful for you in future RC plane purchases.  That's just an example. I'm speaking from experience...it's best to get something that works and will fit your needs. Do your own research :)"
radiocontrol,3ddzq2,jugzeh,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:33:47 2015 UTC,"Thanks a lot, the engines were the part that worried me the most, I thought about it for almost 2 weeks now and an electrical plane would probably be the better choice. I don't think it's worth to get this plane with all the problems it could cause, but I still wanted to know what people with more knowledge would say about it.  Not to mention I would have to drive around 30-50 minutes to the next club with an airfield that allows nitro engines. I don't know the regularities in other countries, but in Germany you have to either go to an airfield where they allow nitro engines or you have to be at least 1.5 km away from the next village or town.   The plane you suggested looks great, I'll look into it and probably some other models and manufacturers, just as you said, I'll do my research.  Just to have it mentioned, I'm not completely new to RC models, I did have a nice electric RC Truggy for quite some time until i sold it 3 years ago. I'm a big fan of tinkering with everything I can get my hands on, but the one thing that always bothered me with the car were the batteries. I loved driving it, but always having to go home when I drove through my 3 batteries was quite annoying, and with each engine upgrade, the old batteries would empty out faster :P . So I thought about a nitro modell, but as I already mentioned it, an electrical plane is probably the better start, I can always buy a second (or third) plane with a nitro engine.  Again thanks for the advice."

Definitely. I'm also a tinkerer and that's exactly what I did (had some experience coming in, but started with electric just so I could get experience learning & flying). Now I have all three - eletric, nitro, and regular gas. I love them all. Giant scale and gas is the best IMO :) My house is really just littered with airplanes and parts, and I love it (girlfriend does not, hehe). This is what I have instead of a dinner table on any give day of the week. I think this will be you soon :)  Some good news is the price for new nitro motors has come down a lot.

radiocontrol,3ddzq2,11e10,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:22:07 2015 UTC,"Good advice. You can get a bixler type glider arf (easy to fly and can do some fun stuff too! It's my test bed, I've done all sorts of experiments with it, solid plane) and piece  together a tx/rx/9 channel radio  for a total of <$200. Sure, it might be more expensive than a rtf, but now you have a great tx/rx that you can easily move to any plane you buy in the future!

radiocontrol,3ddzq2,11e10,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:28:46 2015 UTC,"Thanks, but gliders are not the type of plane I'm interested in and the bixler doesn't seem to have tires to lift of and land with, I'd prefere a plane with them. I don't want a plane I'll get bored with fast, so I'd rather spend over 300€ to get something I can both learn to fly with and then maybe do some upgrades later on to be able to do more advanced maneuvers. ( being able to do that without upgrades would be even better)"
radiocontrol,3ddzq2,Badapple18,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:37:57 2015 UTC,"Understood, just thought I'd share. Some people clip the wings and shorten the fuselage a bit to get extra maneuverability, but you're right that you should go with something more aggressive from the beginning if that's what you want!   Either way, I would still recommend purchasing a nice tx/rx/radio separately. You put together a pretty robust system for about $100, and you can easily move between aircraft as you get more/upgrade (you sound like the type of person who will end up with multiple planes!). My equipment is 9 channel with telemetry, and can support helos if I ever decide to try it. More than I'll ever use, probably, and it cost me about $80 at the time. The way I see it, I'm at no matter what aircraft I decide to fly in the future!   Good luck in your search, and happy flying!"

You didn't damage anything. Some chargers are very picky. If you have trouble with it, you may consider plugging the battery up to your quad and draining it as low as you can (say 3.5V for the two lower cells), and then doing a very slow balance charge (0.5A or less) to see if your charger will bring those two cells back up before hitting the 3rd. But again to answer your question the battery is fine. I would invest in a charger that measures internal resistance, as that is the true health indicator of a battery."

Even 4 is on the medium-high side. You do indicate you typically charge at 3C which is fine unless the pack isn't rated for it. I have packs with over 200 flights that still read 0.1-2.0 mOhms. Sounds like you're good to go though!
radiocontrol,3ddhow,jugzeh,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:44:14 2015 UTC,"You mis understood, it displays 2, 4 and 6 because theyre all measured against the same ground lead, so its 2 each ;) standard turnigy 30-40c pack btw"
radiocontrol,3ddhow,darkhelmet46,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:50:07 2015 UTC,"The charger is measuring the voltage of each cell under load (taking readings from the balance lead..) and thus calculates the IR of each cell individually. I've seen the accucel measure IR @ our field, and it's definitely per cell, and not the IR of the whole pack divided by cell count. Unless your accucel has some firmware I am not familiar with. Plus, what would be the point of displaying IRs cumulatively with cell count?"

radiocontrol,3df50p,hippiehater23,2,Wed Jul 15 19:57:47 2015 UTC,"If it has dihedral or polyhedral it should fly fine, as the rudder will allow you to make slight banks and turn the aircraft while the wing keeps you level."
radiocontrol,3df50p,DrKite,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:15:40 2015 UTC,One thing that I've noticed is that if you add too much power to a craft with dihedral etc it will fly as if its out of control
radiocontrol,3df50p,d0dgerrabbit,2,Wed Jul 15 20:37:14 2015 UTC,Sounds like it was poorly trimmed.  Most likely thrust angle.
radiocontrol,3df50p,dusty78,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:56:01 2015 UTC,"It was swooping left and right. Yeah, trim and expo were bad. All fixed but it still gets bad if I floor it"
radiocontrol,3df50p,d0dgerrabbit,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:48:34 2015 UTC,Unstability at low speeds is usually an aft CG.  Unstability at high speeds is usually thrust angle.  Try adding a washer to point the engine down/right a couple degrees.  Trim isn't just the little knobs next to the joysticks.  EDIT: unless it's an over-wing pod; then you want right and up.
radiocontrol,3df50p,dusty78,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:55:49 2015 UTC,"I think it's a dampening problem with the way the dihedral works.  Dihedral/polyhedral is an aerodynamic linkage between sideslip and roll. Usage of the rudder induces sideslip, causing the angle of attack on the wings to be differential, and one side generates more lift than the other. It will then roll until it hopefully finds dynamic equilibrium.  However, without proper damping it oscillates before settling, and if roll or sideslip are underdamped enough it may become uncontrollable. This would most likely show up at high energy flight with strong aero forces- where small disturbances may create large oscillations.  Again, just theory."
radiocontrol,3df50p,Datum000,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:04:54 2015 UTC,"Fuck theory, that makes perfect sense based on what I've seen in my polyhedral plane!   What is damping?"
radiocontrol,3df50p,d0dgerrabbit,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:49:18 2015 UTC,"Damping is the absorption of energy in a dynamic system- like shock absorbers in cars. If you've ever driven in a car with bad shocks you may remember how a dip or bump lasts quite a while after the matter ;)  In this case it would be an aerodynamic damping, wings and fuselage will make subsidence of all motion (primarily drag from the forward flight), and as such it also occurs for roll, pitch, and yaw rates.  Making the plane more damped is probably going to mean more drag all around, so I think best thing to do is to decrease the polyhedral so it's less sensitive."
radiocontrol,3df50p,Datum000,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:14:39 2015 UTC,Is adding shocks an option? I have materials designed for converting audio frequency vibrations into heat. Adding weight is OK since my drunk plane could go faster but the oscillations keep me at a cruise
radiocontrol,3df50p,d0dgerrabbit,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:31:47 2015 UTC,"Interesting idea. I'm not sure it would work since these are flight oscillations and not structural, but aeroelasticity is a hugely important part of structural design- play around with that stuff and see what you can find!"
radiocontrol,3df50p,Datum000,2,Sun Jul 19 06:00:56 2015 UTC,"For planes designed for it, usually it isn't too hard at all. My slow stick is rudder only and it flies just fine."

radiocontrol,3df50p,Dax420,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:37:57 2015 UTC,"To prevent it from out of control you do nothing...literally let go of the stick and it will level out by itself.  As others have said, it's generally easy to fly a well designed rudder-elevator airplane one with ailerons, especially for newbies.  However, if you are used to ailerons, you might need to get used to the slower response time that you get with just rudder.  This won't quite be the type of airplane where you just think about a manuever and it does it.  It's a more relaxed style of flying.  I like to use the surfing analogy of comparing it to riding a short board (ailerons) vs a long board (rudder-elevator ""floater"")."
radiocontrol,3df50p,WarthogOsl,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:39:33 2015 UTC,It's no problem. Just avoid any crazy aerobatics close to the ground until you're familiar with how it handles. The bird of time is a cool plane :)
radiocontrol,3debk7,d0dgerrabbit,3,Wed Jul 15 16:34:26 2015 UTC,"Landing in the tall grass sounds like your best option. You can get parachutes (and plans) but deploying it without tangling on your tail could be tricky.   Alternately, build a delta because they can be fast (just not efficient in tight turns) and also slow right down without a sharp stall.  Military drones often recover into a net or something similar, but that's hard for a modeller.  A bungee launch is much easier than an air-drop, BTW."
radiocontrol,3debk7,IvorTheEngine,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:04:02 2015 UTC,A bungee would totally be easier but I'm concerned about the G-force. The airplane is experimental to try and find the maximum airspeed for the building materials.
radiocontrol,3debk7,IvorTheEngine,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:12:01 2015 UTC,"A launch bungee for a fast model is fairly gentle compared to a glider launch, as it's not pulling against the wing. I've got a model where the hook is only held on by tape and it's more than strong enough. It's probably less force than a throw, just applied over a lot more distance.  Deltas are good for strength too. A tradition long thin speed wing needs to be really strong. Presumably you don't need to do tight 'pylon racer' style turns?"
radiocontrol,3debk7,IvorTheEngine,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:33:21 2015 UTC,"Presumably you don't need to do tight 'pylon racer' style turns?   Not at all! If I have to turn using an immelman I'm fine with that. This is almost purely a speed thing. Another of my self imposed requirements is that it looks like a traditional prop plane in some way. IDGAF about scale, I just want it to look like it could be a real plane.  I'm not sure a delta is a good idea because the plane needs 2-3 batteries at 5S for the motors I've selected in addition to not looking real/normal.  For the bungie, I'm sure if I include a wood frame as part of the main fusalage it might work as long as the motors are attached to that as well. The motors themselves are 187g and the controllers are 150g. The 5S batteries are 400g but I might use 6S and risk the motors health.   If the bungie does 0-60 in 1 second thats 3 g's."
radiocontrol,3debk7,dusty78,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:02:26 2015 UTC,"Fair enough, we all have standards for how a model should look.  3g is nothing though, it's common for a model to pull 10g in a loop or tight turn."
radiocontrol,3debk7,ConvertsToMetric,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:01:36 2015 UTC,"A couple quick observations:  If your 'building materiel' isn't strong enough for a bungee launch, it's too weak to mount a motor that fully utilizes a 5S battery.  If your 'building materiel' is strong enough to withstand the aerodynamic forces at high speed, it's capable of landing in grass and bungee launching.  I've had a plane that was so structurally unsound that it blew apart ~60mph (pitch speed, no idea of true speed, but undoubtedly less), but had no problem with the bungee or belly flopping.  You're either seriously underestimating your materiel's strength and worrying about nothing; or overestimating it's strength and the plane won't hold up to any launch or high speed.  Either way, design for bungee/bellyflop and hope for the best."
radiocontrol,3debk7,TomTheGeek,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:42:30 2015 UTC,"Ok, my planes totally handle 60mph just fine. My worst plane only gets squirrely at highspeeds due to being 3 channel."

The salt water causes he tabs on the LiPO to be damaged - essentially etching them away. This results in the discharge process halting before the battery is completely drained.

radiocontrol,3daggf,GoldenShadowGS,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:50:20 2015 UTC,"Batteries connected in parallel will have an average voltage reading of all connected packs. If you leave them all connected long enough, (charger or not) they will equalize and all will read the same voltage when you disconnect them.   -NOTE: connecting two packs in parallel allows charge to flow from the batteries with higher charge to the batteries with less charge. If the this difference is too great, too much amps could flow, charging the lower battery at a greater CRating than it was designed for.  Charging in parallel is not any more dangerous than normal if you allow the packs to equalize for 5-20 minutes before you plug in the charger. The time needed to equalize depends on how closely their voltages matched to begin with."

radiocontrol,3d7niu,TomTheGeek,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:53:35 2015 UTC,So I just went to my local RC store and they were trying to sell me a Spektrum DX6i for 160$ and that was without the receiver!   From what I can see the two radios are basically comparable. Is there something I'm missing?
radiocontrol,3d7niu,kcdale99,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:53:47 2015 UTC,Not really. They have brand name and out of the box compatibility but that's about it. You can buy a module for the back of the 9x to make it compatible with the Spektrum stuff for $10-20. Also you can buy extra receivers for the 9X for $8.

I'm not saying this applies to everything they sell, quite the contrary. I am saying you should look around for product reviews before deciding to purchase the product.

Also, you can check the motor for wear.  I suspect it's a brushed motor, and those things do wear out.    I would suspect it's more your batteries have passed their charge/discharge life though.

But the Hammer - that thing was fast, handled well, and could make it over just about anything that 12-14 year old me could throw at it.  I have had a few other hobby grade R/Cs since then, including a few Tamiya road cars, a T-Maxx, a Sprint32 Sport, and an SC10RS...  The SC10RS was the first one that really made me feel like a kid again.  The T-Maxx was bigger, faster, and really awesome, but I broke so many parts on it and was always having reliability problems with the motor (it was my first and so far only nitro)... the SC10 I have put through a lot and it's taken all of it, and it's easy enough to work on where when I break something (which I will sooner or later), I am not afraid to try working on it like I was with the T-Maxx."

radiocontrol,3d4t55,nate51595,2,Tue Jul 14 08:17:55 2015 UTC,"How much do you want to spend? If you want a simple upgrade, I would put a LiPo battery in there that's a couple volts higher (because fuck it) and include a low-voltage cutoff between the battery and the current electronics. Get a small charger with it, and for less than $50 you should be seeing multiple-hour run times with a 30-minute charge or so.   Wanna do more? Here's the rabbit hole...  LiPo batteries shouldn't be discharged below a certain level, and the current electronics don't handle this. You'd need a better speed control, which won't be compatible with the proprietary electronics, so you'll need a receiver to handle it. The receiver likely won't work with the proprietary servo, so you'll likely have to get a servo and rig it in there somehow.   Then, you'll have a stock motor, which is pretty useless, but if you upgraded it, you should be concerned about the drivetrain as it will most likely strip gears almost immediately. You'll probably have to fabricate something using replacement parts from another truck.   But then, you still have an upgraded toy you dumped money into. I totally get the sentimental side of it, but Team Associated RTRs, with all this crap in it and a proper radio, is $250. You can take them to a racetrack right away, they're a lot stronger, and they're designed to be fast and upgradable.

radiocontrol,3d4y05,MelloCooper,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:31:27 2015 UTC,"Just to give you a reference, I think I spent $40 on the original, and our budget was $80. Other group members pitched in too. But the frame (pontoon supports, hull struts, and hull cross members) are all PVC, the pontoons are pool noodles, and the hull is laser cut compressed hardwood (basically a cheap flexible wood one notch bellow plywood but more uniform in composition) (and the laser cutting was free from the university). We bought the cheapest Chinese brushed motors plus the props and couplers, and I didn't even bother to water proof them. I already had the Arduino, and I had to borrow the motor driver and battery. I also bought the sensor. The rest was hacked together with duct tape and way too much silicon grease. The boat minus all electronics was maybe $15-$20. And I no longer have the most expensive electric components. The hull wouldn't even have room to fit these things. However, because of that link I found Voith, the company that seems to be the primary manufacturer for industrial versions of that prop. They make a lot of really cool stuff, including a rotating cylinder on their skeg (not sure exactly what that is, it seems to be a fixed rudder/ part of the keel) that gives their boats a lot more turning force for towing and better maneuverability. I don't think I'll use that either, but I'm really interested to see what else they have. Between all of this, the use of jets for industrial use, hydrofoils, variable pitch props, and rim driven props, I'm really starting to get blown away at the diversity of prop and navigation systems in water craft nowadays. I never realized that there was so much more that fixed props and rudder combos!"

I might see if they have some position keeping software I can learn from, but I'll be starting with my own material. The GPS and compass alone should give me lots of control. Just point towards the waypoint, go until you get there, correct heading as you go. I can add a PID loop and give it strafing capabilities (to make full use of the azi-pods, eliminate unecissarily hard turns and use of the primary motors, and maintain optimal heading relative to wind and current) etc later. The hardware isn't very similar to that ROV. Their forum may be helpful, but regular RC covers almost all of my hardware. Their forum might help if I decide to try an anchor to reduce battery draw or if I want to drop a payload in the water on a string (like a sensor, light, data logger, depth sensor, or maybe a camera with stabilizing fins that I can drag) through the water."
radiocontrol,3d4y05,shitterplug,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:56:39 2015 UTC,To control translation and rotation you'd want 8 fixed motors directed as below.  _|  |_ _    _  |  |   Diagonals pairs to control rotation and adjacent pairs to control translation.  Should be achievable with gyro/mag sensors on an arduino board.  Could probably control it by hacking a cheap octo capable arduino multirotor board.

Not complaining at all and I was one of the volunteers, but there were just a TON of midairs at this event.  It was a combination of the number of beginners and the number of people who aren't familiar with event or club field flying etiquette.  I personally had a midair with a quad that was loitering and bouncing around over the runway, despite flying with a spotter and clearly calling out the landing approach.  Additionally if there was any kind of failure there were SO many people right on the flight line that I was worried about hurting someone.    If I could have had the maiden in a week earlier I would have felt much better but would still have been worried about midairs.

What's the deal with the servo though? I've not seen that with any quads before. Is there some sort of intrinsic need with the tri design?
radiocontrol,3d06b4,Popetown,2,Sun Jul 12 12:26:41 2015 UTC,It provides yaw
radiocontrol,3d06b4,psychometrixo,1 point,Sun Jul 12 13:18:38 2015 UTC,Interesting. I'll have to look into that. Is that because you can't effectively control it with prop speed bias since there aren't an even number of props?
radiocontrol,3d06b4,Popetown,2,Sun Jul 12 13:53:17 2015 UTC,That's exactly it. On a craft with an even number of rotors you can provide yaw control via differential torque. A tricopter cannot do this and needs a mechanical control for the last degree of freedom.  Good intuition on your part.
radiocontrol,3d06b4,psychometrixo,1 point,Sun Jul 12 13:57:28 2015 UTC,"Right on. Yeah, I've never dabbled in any of that but I've owned a few helis. Mostly toy to hobby level.

So scary that thing. I never truly figured out all of the TX configs and it was never really tame enough for my novice level.

radiocontrol,3cxj21,pawnzor007,1 point,Sun Jul 12 01:53:50 2015 UTC,I am assuming that to get into this hobby with a basic kit it would require several hundred dollars?
radiocontrol,3cxj21,IvorTheEngine,3,Sat Jul 11 19:34:36 2015 UTC,"You can do it cheaper than that. There are lots of RTF (ready to fly) models but they tend to come with gear that you can't reuse on later models (and only one battery, which sucks once you can fly for a few minutes without breaking something!).   Many people start with one of those to see if they like the hobby, and then go on to buy a decent transmitter, battery charger and a stock of batteries. If you're sure you want to get into the hobby, you can save money by buying reasonable quality stuff at the start. (You don't tend to crash a transmitter or charger, so they last years)  You don't say but it sounds like you want a plane. The ideal model really depends on your flying field and weather. Small models bounce better than big ones, are cheaper and need less space to fly, but they don't like the wind - they get knocked around or just blown downwind.  If you've got a club or friend to help, you can start with a much better model than if you're teaching yourself.  A good place to start if you're on your own would be the Bixler from hobbyking (order from the warehouse nearest to you) - but I'd strongly recommend finding a club. Not only is it much easier to learn, but it's a lot more fun in company. Clubs vary though, if you find one that's not very welcoming, try another.  Also, see the 'getting started' link on the right."
radiocontrol,3cxj21,Anonymoushipopotomus,1 point,Sat Jul 11 20:02:30 2015 UTC,Thank You for a very detailed and informative answer.   I found a Super Cub S on a local classifieds for $100 including the transmitter and charger. What should I look out for? Really tempted to go pick it up today
radiocontrol,3cxj21,IvorTheEngine,2,Sat Jul 11 21:17:31 2015 UTC,Is it blue or red? Red models are newer and have LiPos. Check to make sure the prop spins straight and that theres no crazy vibration when applying heavy throttle. Make sure all the controls work and no large chunks missing from the foam.
radiocontrol,3cxj21,Wrobot_rock,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:15:25 2015 UTC,"That's the HobbyZone one? It's a good model for learning your own, as it's really stable and pretty tough.  Check how much they are new, as that doesn't sound particularly cheap. Note that the same model sells with and without a transmitter. The stock transmitter is fine for this model but when you get your second model, you'll probably want one with more functions.  Get the seller to show you all the controls working, and look for obvious crash damage. Most things are repairable (or you can get spares) but you should be able to negotiate a lower price if you can see glue or tape repairs. Take 8 (or 4, for the newer models) AA batteries with you to check the radio. If the seller can't show you it working, walk away and spend a little more on a new one.  Most likely the battery will need replacing, they only last a couple of years, but they're only about $10, and you'll want more than one anyway. I'd budget another $50 for a better charger and 3 or 4 batteries. (It's normal for each battery to give you a 10-15 minute flight). Old, tired batteries look as if they're working when you try them on the ground, but just can't deliver as much power as they used to.  This model needs a field big enough for a couple of football pitches, and (at least for your first few flights) almost no wind."

You only need one channel for flaps, they lower the stall speed so its easier to land, but I find the plane flies so slowly that it's hard to bring it down for a landing with flaps down. I like using the stall to help bring it down. Also, the bix3 comes with y connectors for the ailerons and flaps, so you only need one channel for the flaps"
radiocontrol,3cxj21,Anonymoushipopotomus,2,Sun Jul 12 01:20:41 2015 UTC,"Jumping in to second on getting a quality transmitter if your going into the hobby for 'keeps', the 9x is IMO the best budget transmitter for the massive range of open source firmware and community support for it.

Most shops will match the U.S. price with exchange and you shouldn't have to pay any shipping or worry about getting LiPos over the border.
radiocontrol,3cvww8,BTallack,1 point,Sat Jul 11 05:52:04 2015 UTC,Ontario Canada. I've just noticed that a lot of shops up here really gouge you on the prices.
radiocontrol,3cvww8,BTallack,1 point,Sat Jul 11 05:56:28 2015 UTC,"You've got to take exchange into account. The 200QX is $229.99 USD but with current exchange, that's $291.22 CAD before you add shipping and customs. Even if your LHS is selling it for $299-$320 it's likely still cheaper than buying directly from Horizon."

Take off and landing on a runway is a whole element of fun and skill. I would say to get a plane that has flaps and retracts, maybe a 1400 t28 or something like that. I fly Spektrum and use a dx transmitter but I must admit that if I were starting out I would probably go a different route because of the Taranis tx."

For the transmitter, if you can get a Taranis now, you'll probably never want anything else. But it may be more cash than you want to spend at once. The FrSky system is fantastic, and way more economical overall than other systems out there."

radiocontrol,3csfxi,Jimmars,7,Fri Jul 10 12:02:59 2015 UTC,Dont waterproof it at all. Use a brushless inrunner.   Seal the stator / windings with epoxy / plastidip / whatever. Let the rotor be submerged. Use low-rpm and high clearance rotor-stator motor or friction will be a problem.   Deep dive pros do it that way.
radiocontrol,3csfxi,NoTifuToday,2,Fri Jul 10 14:57:56 2015 UTC,"This. I had to build a boat for an engineering class, and we got standard brushed motors. I was worried about them shorting so we designed the pontoons with recesses to encase the motors, and we would tape the other vents. Turns out, not even brushed motors care about water. I wouldn't recommend flooding them for long durations, but we didn't even insults our terminals. The suckers each drew a 15A spike when we spun them up to full throttle (we ran out of time to program in a sensible PID loop) and they ran at 5v. I never even saw an arc. Brushless motors would do even better. Hell, they'd probably appreciate the extra cooling.  Edit: just make sure you test them first. Put them in fresh water, keep your hands out of the water, and slowly ramp up the power. Test in salt if you need to use it there."
radiocontrol,3csfxi,Red_Raven,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:57:18 2015 UTC,I had some tiny electric motors  from a quadcopter laying about that I hoped would serve me well. So you're saying they'll run wet?
radiocontrol,3csfxi,Red_Raven,1 point,Fri Jul 10 22:48:34 2015 UTC,"I would think so, especially if they're brushless. Be sure to let them dry out when you're done. The only question is, is any of it's metal exposed (ie, without an enamel coating, paint, oxide layer, anodized, etc)? Exposed metal will probably rust over time. But brushless motors SHOULD be able to operate in water just fine. If the vents are easy to cover, I'd still do it. You'll still get extra cooling from the water. I'm being cautious in my wording because those motors are not explicitly built for water. Ones that are manage water cooling better, have corrosion-resistant coatings, and more insulation. Like I said, I'd be perfectly willing to try most motors in the water, especially if they're not too expensive. But start slow. Higher voltage means a spark is more likely, and while a spark might not be immediately lethal to the motor it won't help. Water is more conductive than air because of all its impurities, so motors spark in water more. Just use caution, and trust your judgement. Remember that water can also strip the grease out faster, so come up with a plan to replace the grease and remember to run the motors out of water sometimes so you can hear the bearings."

The arduino code for the current version can be found here: http://pastebin.com/g1eMrQ0w  Turning in reverse doesn't work at the moment because I haven't tidied that part up, but it otherwise works very well. I'll try to post a video of it in operation some time soon if anyone's interested."

radiocontrol,3cbutp,kwaaaaaaaaa,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:07:26 2015 UTC,"I don't see why it would be all that difficult. Most transmitters have a trainer port you can bind to any channel (in this case, throttle). You just need a pedal and some way of sending ppm signals to the trainer port in relation to the pedal movements. Not sure if a turnkey solution exists for pedals, but you can probably use something like an ESC/Servo tester that can do ppm. Or hack a cheap transmitter to use the pots and electronics. If you know microcontrollers, you can also use that to generate the signals."

radiocontrol,3cbutp,Willard37,2,Tue Jul 7 02:06:55 2015 UTC,"I found this PPM encoder, for you.   Here's a servo tester  The servo tester outputs PWM (which most servos are controlled with. But a trainer port only takes PPM, so the encoder will convert PWM to PPM. Once you setup your trainer port, you can bind the throttle channel to the PPM channel so the external device controls it (this will depend on your TX brand/model). Also be careful of voltages, make sure the trainer port doesn't require some lower voltage, like 3.3v."
radiocontrol,3cbutp,Willard37,2,Tue Jul 7 02:18:25 2015 UTC,"Not that I want to counter you, but you could have it still enabled on the TX, so if you have to jump, you don't have to fuzzle for control."

I bought lots of other stuff too throughout the years including a charger that would not power on. I called them and they took care of it right away. They do sell out of stuff and don't restock it many times but most places are the same way. It seems to be more of a manufacturer issue than a store one.

I got a plane from them and needed a new motor (it arced and poofed up on me during the first power-up and wouldn't run anymore).  They said ""sounds like a defect, yeah.""  Trying to get them to send me a replacement motor was impossible, and they sounded like they didn't even want to take my phone call in the first place.  I decided, after that, to not buy from them anymore.  That's my personal experience.  Surely there are hundreds of people who have had no issues with them.  I get the impression that, if you are interacting with their website only, it's no different from anywhere else.  If you're interacting with someone there via email or phone... you might consider looking elsewhere.  If you buy from them and DO need phone support, it might be beneficial to look for one of their competitors for parts.  They probably have better customer service and, adding to what others have already said, their item availability is poor and restocking lead times are very long."

On a whim I build a Flight Test Versa which can probably be built with spare parts you may already have (lots of flight test diy builds to pick from and if you have spare motors/escs it doesn't cost much to pick up some servos and another receiver).  I've been enjoying it ever since.  I have an EPP foam PopWing (which is basically indestructible) and I'm just finishing up my build of a FT-22.  What surprised me is how much I enjoy LOS for airplanes.  I don't really like LOS on my miniquad but on the planes LOS is really fun for me.

Looks easy enough, but I am sure some cuts I make might not be %100 accurate like in the build video.  Do you think there is room for a pixhawk inside?  I was debating about going with blunt nose if needed to fit it.  What motor/prop/battery did you use?  I have a spare DJI red 2212 920kv, some 8"", 9"", 10"" props, spare 30amp ESC, and 3s 2200mah, 3300mah and 4s 5000mah, would that setup work?"
radiocontrol,3c713w,notamedclosed,3,Sun Jul 5 23:00:37 2015 UTC,"I cut it myself.  Just start with a fresh, sharp X-ACTO knife.  Build was quite easy, even though I messed up more than a few things.  Most of the flight test builds are pretty forgiving.  The blunt nose should have room for a Pixhawk.  Personally I would skip it for your first build (just do a regular Versa wing first).  Setting up the flight controller stabilization is just additional complexity, plus you'll learn a lot about your transmitter.  For a second build you could get fancier but at that point maybe you'll want a more serious airframe.  I've got a Popwing with a plywood blunt section that I have the full APM stack on and it's quite a nice machine to fly.    I think you could make what you have work but it might not be ideal.  My first setup was a little out of whack.  I had a 800kv motor that I attached to a 4S 5000 mah battery.  That battery was way too big for a Blunt Nose Versa.  It still flew though.  I later built a regular FPV Versa wing (still pusher though) where I used a 2206 2250Kv motor on 3s 1800mah with a 6"" prop.  That was a fun little plane.  Lastly 2 key components to building a successful airplane are:   CoG - Must be in the correct spot.  Flying wings have a very narrow valid CoG range.  There are marks on the plans for both regular and blunt.  It can be very slightly forward, but if it's backwards you won't be flying.  The Versa wing tends to be tail heavy which is nice if you want to add FPV gear up front, but otherwise you might need to strap some weight up front (I used 25c coins). It's not mentioned in the build videos that I saw.  However, you need to center your servo before you put the servo horn on.  To do this just power the servo up with your receiver and ensure the channel it's on is receiving a middle signal from the transmitter.   So plug it into the aileron channel and wiggle that stick so you can hear it move.  With it centered then mount the servo horn (keep the servo powered).  Now you can wiggle the aileron stick again and watch the servo horn move."

This one required some paperwork from the county, where we have the ability to block off a parking lot and use it as a runway, but only on Sundays. There's no dues or anything.   What you should do is check with the land owners and see if there's some way to make it happen. Just be sure it's nowhere near an airport since that would be a waste of time.

Don't run them RIGHT after charging. Keep driving until the speed is boringly slow and wait for the batteries to cool a bit and charge em again! Run them till they are dead and put them away.

I went to run it and they ran full strength for about 45 seconds before getting super weak. I trickle charged them for 5 hours and they were good as new. Storing them for a week should cause no issues. You will notice that they are much stronger right after charging however.
radiocontrol,3c6pc7,link_dead,2,Wed Jul 8 14:36:41 2015 UTC,"No, but you don't want to do a deep discharge or store it with a charge lower than about 40%. When the car starts to get slower, it's generally a good idea to throw the pack back on the charger after letting it cool a bit."
radiocontrol,3c6pc7,shitterplug,5,Sun Jul 5 11:29:34 2015 UTC,"Not correct for NiMH, for best performance and life you want to store them discharged.    If you don't care about getting the most performance from the cells or they are not quality cells you can store them however you like."
radiocontrol,3c6pc7,link_dead,2,Sun Jul 5 16:06:56 2015 UTC,Absolutely wrong. Read the manual that comes with any nimh pack. If you store them flat the cells will unmatch.
radiocontrol,3c6pc7,shitterplug,2,Sun Jul 5 20:37:39 2015 UTC,"The manuals are derived from the manufacturer's datasheets for the cells.  In our hobby we go well outside the datasheet's recommended discharge and recharge envelops.  We have over many years created our own best practices for cell storage, charging, and matching.  It can be considered a lost art form at this stage since lipo is now the dominate technology.  If you had asked this question 10 or 15 years ago on any of the major email lists or BB at the time everyone would have told you to store them with no charge.    Cells are matched by internal impedance, only age and cycles will change that outside cell failure.      The best practice is store the cells discharged, take packs directly off the charger and put them into use.  Cool the packs back to room temps before recharging."
radiocontrol,3c6pc7,link_dead,2,Sun Jul 5 21:14:29 2015 UTC,"No. I used to zap my own packs. I've been in this game a long time. You do not discharge nimh packs before storage, period. Storing them discharged causes the anode wrap to delaminate because the primary buffer starts to oxidize."

radiocontrol,3c5dxl,Ben_there_done_that1,6,Sat Jul 4 23:26:54 2015 UTC,"Flite Test is the way to go if you're just getting into it, but the Storch is pretty complex. What about the FT Flyer, or the Nutball?  A FlySky FS-T4B transmitter/receiver can be found on Amazon for <$40, and the electronics for the smaller FT planes (Flyer, Nutball, etc) can be acquired on Flite Test or LazerToyz for around $60-70.  Around $100 initial investment is pretty reasonable, and if you're careful you can re-use the servos/motor/ESC/etc as you move up in model complexity.  I started with the FT Flyer, beat it to pieces learning to fly, and re-used all the parts on the next plane, and the next."
radiocontrol,3c5dxl,cupkeyboardpaper,2,Sat Jul 4 23:55:14 2015 UTC,"Thanks for those plane suggestions, I'll definitely look into those. Instead of the FlySky FS-T4B transmitter, I was considering the Turnigy 4X FHSS 2.4ghz Transmitter. Are there any distinct advantages that one has over the other?"
radiocontrol,3c5dxl,whidzee,3,Sun Jul 5 00:51:05 2015 UTC,Definitely look at the FT Flyer as a first plane. Easy to build and repair. Cheap to build.   As for the radio. My first radio was a cheap hobbyking 6 channel radio. I think it cost me $30. Although it was great for what I wanted at the beginning I found I quickly grew out of it.   I would recommend against a 4 channel radio. Get at least 6. Let's say in 6 months you want to try flying a mini quad. You'll need extra channels for mode switching and stuff like that.   The Turnigy 9x is a great radio and at the moment it's only about $60. You won't need to upgrade your radio for a very long time. Obviously if you're trying to get I to this hobby as cheaply as possible I understand that. But try to think of the near future. That extra few dollars now will save you a bunch in the future.   Also get a reliable battery charger. That and a transmitter you'll have for a long time. Getting quality ones will give you a better experience.
radiocontrol,3c5dxl,whidzee,2,Sun Jul 5 11:40:12 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the input, I'll see if I can cough up a few more dollars for a nicer transmitter.

radiocontrol,3c5dxl,cupkeyboardpaper,1 point,Sun Jul 5 14:24:22 2015 UTC,"yep thats a good charger, very popular, just think that you will need to power it with a power supply, it cannot be plugged directly into your wall socket if that's what you were hoping. some people use an old pc power supply. it will connect directly to a car battery if you wanted to charge at the field though"
radiocontrol,3c5dxl,trekkie00,1 point,Sun Jul 5 16:18:19 2015 UTC,I've had my hands on a few ~$30 transmitters. At that price level I think they're all about the same. As long as it's got the ability to reverse and trim the servos it's fine.

I started out in a cheap $30 transmitter and ran into limitations the first fine I tried to set it up, and it at least had the ability to be programmed! That one you linked can reverse servos and elevons but not much else. Mixing, dual rates, and expos are your friends!  I ended up getting a Spektrum DX8 which is expensive to start with, but I've seen people have good luck with a 6ch Orange transmitter (programmable with screen!). It would be much more flexible.

radiocontrol,3c5dxl,Datum000,3,Sun Jul 5 02:50:23 2015 UTC,"I'd say get an RTF plane and get some flying experience first.  Then you'll be able to separate potential design/build problems from your flying skills.  I can't recommend the Hobbyking AXN Floater Jet enough. The plane itself is $65 and you just need to add a radio and a battery.  I bought the Turnigy 9X which is a very nice radio.  You'll want to get aaa smaller receiver than comes with the radio, usually less than $10. I flew yesterday for 37 minutes on a 2200mAh battery, with the motor off about 1/3 of the time.  The plane is good enough of a glider that I managed to catch some lift in thermals.  Bruce Simpson (Xjet and RCModelreviews on YouTube) Is a huge fan of the plan for beginners and had a great set of build videos that really do help a beginner.  Here is his overview video.  I went from a total noob with a little simulator time to flying very comfortably with no crashes or hard landings.  I keep the AXN in the back seat of my truck and fly it for 10-20 minutes on my lunch hour."

It turns out the 4 channels are a bit of a handful for me, and I grew up playing flight sims for fun! Admittedly, I never acquired rudder pedals so it just isn't part of muscle memory.  Scratchbuilding is going to be cheaper, and if you at all like building stuff will be very fun and fulfilling.  If you're scratchbuilding, try for the FT Tiny Trainer or some type of 3channel plane first, it will save you lots of propellers."
radiocontrol,3c5dxl,skytrain7,1 point,Mon Jul 6 07:42:55 2015 UTC,"Well, I also jumped into the hobby heads on this summer. I also can just upvote for the Turnigy 9x and a decent lipo charger. Accucell 6 also from Turnigy is a good deal and enough if you aren't going to seriously into it. This will be also your biggest expense. I bought a cheap combo brushless, esc and 3x mini servo for around 25€ from a china store (aliexpress, dealextreme, banggood all free shipping) and a pack of 5 propellers for 2€. I was not even using hobbyking couse i wanted everything the cheapest possible, even if it is horrible quality. I will restock some better parts, when I build a more advanced plane.  I also started building the FT Simple Storch, but then midway decided it was to much of hassle to build one just to crash it. So I went with the FT Delta as all parts have a straight cut to get the pieces out of the foam, but the FT Flyer should be better to start with. I had a few crashes, from which only 2 went horrible and I smashed the exchangeable power pod both times and a few propellers the other time. I haven't yet loosed any electronic parts and the engine shaft is still intact :)  As for a bit of preflight training, download the free game Absolute RC Plane Sim from google play. It will give you a nice feel of what to expect. Only the Cessna model is free, but once you are able to do all the important stuff with it, you are good to go for a real flight, well, at least I managed it. Choose a day where there is no wind, as the small planes from FT like the Delta and Flyer, you will have to much trouble keeping them in the air and under full control."

radiocontrol,3c269k,prometheus5500,3,Sat Jul 4 04:57:07 2015 UTC,"If you are going for jumps, go ahead! Really, whatever you feel fits your driving style. That's the beauty of a track. Just make sure to make it wide!"
radiocontrol,3c269k,dem_welshcakes,2,Sat Jul 4 06:07:56 2015 UTC,The high speed straight away if you have one should be as close to the drivers stand/area as possible.
radiocontrol,3c269k,1320Fastback,1 point,Sat Jul 4 03:45:49 2015 UTC,Can I ask why?
radiocontrol,3c269k,PimpinPoptart,2,Sat Jul 4 06:01:43 2015 UTC,Going fast in a straight line is hard when you can't see properly
radiocontrol,3c269k,Jimmars,1 point,Sat Jul 4 07:37:35 2015 UTC,This.  It's very difficult to control your vehicle at 50mph when its 40 feet away going left to right and the whole track is in your vision with 10 other vehicles jumping and turning in your view.   Any track with the high speed part opposite the drivers stand is just poor planning.
radiocontrol,3c269k,1320Fastback,1 point,Sat Jul 4 16:30:59 2015 UTC,"I'd go for a track in a figure 8 layout, that way you can have exactly the same number of right- and lefthanders. The crossing can also be a jump of course, in case you often drive on the track with other drivers. Also, it should be halfway rhythmical - all the fast swepers bundled in one section, all the tight corners in another. That will cut down on battery- and tire-eating, motor-heating braking and acceleration maneuvers. Jumps should have a downsloping landing ramp, much easier on the car."
radiocontrol,3c269k,mhpr262,1 point,Sat Jul 4 10:29:52 2015 UTC,you could just do every second race in reverse.
radiocontrol,3c269k,henry82,1 point,Mon Jul 6 03:48:57 2015 UTC,"That doesn't work with the jumps if they are proper jumps, not just bumps in the track."

As a practical matter there's not space to use in the HF bands, but anything above 400 MHz, sure ...  (TV channel 2 takes 54-60 MHz (pre-digital switchover, of course), so you certainly can put them into the lower frequency bands, but it'll take a lot of space, relatively speaking, even if it's still 6 MHz.)"

The lower the frequency, the larger the radio wave and therefore, the less information you can transmit. This is why 5.8Ghz can pass so much more information than say, 900mhz. The flipside is that 900mhz, because it's wave is so much larger, can deal with much more obstruction than 5.8ghz, because the smaller wave is easier to scatter (and therefore lose information).

radiocontrol,3bvv85,Qwigs,2,Thu Jul 2 19:30:05 2015 UTC,Check that your servo horn hasn't stripped. Best way to check is dissconnect the horn and see if your servo responds properly. If the horn is stripped the teeth on the inside of it will be damaged or gone. It may have just worked itself loose. Check it all out before you lash out on a new servo.

radiocontrol,3bvzq7,xiMbd03u1,2,Thu Jul 2 17:27:28 2015 UTC,"Hadn't thought of cross posting. Thanks!  I think I'll try the resistor thing tonight.

radiocontrol,3bvzq7,Flite_Brothers,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:35:38 2015 UTC,"Since the pot is almost certainly being used as a voltage divider, it doesn't seem like the actual resistance should matter. (EDIT: assuming a DC signal, which this is)"
radiocontrol,3bvzq7,Fragmaster,2,Fri Jul 3 02:58:38 2015 UTC,"Put the old pots back in the radio, recalibrate it, and use subtrims to center on 1500 like everyone has to do"
radiocontrol,3bvzq7,xiMbd03u1,2,Thu Jul 2 20:20:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah, definitely tried to center them with sub-trim, adjusting end-points, re-calibrating several times, restoring to factory settings, etc.  After setting it with subtrim, it stays good for maybe 2-3 minutes. Then it starts to wander anywhere between ~1350-1650 with absolutely no stick inputs.  I used it like that for a couple weeks, but it got so bad I couldn't arm/disarm the damn thing."
radiocontrol,3bvzq7,SurvivingAthens,2,Thu Jul 2 20:30:11 2015 UTC,"If your pots are half the expected resistance, you can simply set your curves to linear default and apply a 200 scale factor in er9x.  Adjust the first number on the channel to 200. Your resolution will be half of that of a true 5k pot, but it should still be smooth enough.  This may aggravate your floating center stick resistance though."

radiocontrol,3bkxf6,AgEnT_x19,3,Tue Jun 30 01:44:12 2015 UTC,"""Secure digital connection"" probably means encryption, with two main goals :  #1 Encryption to make sure that nobody can read the signal from either direction (reading the positions of your sticks could be of some use (see what the craft is doing before it does it), but reading the telemetry to see what the aircraft is sending back, including video or other sensor data certainly could be), and  #2 Encrypting to make sure that the signals that reach the aircraft were actually sent from the proper control center rather than from an impostor.  I'm not sure about DSMX specifically, but DSM2 just had a unique GUID for each transmitter (or each model on each transmitter), and the RX was designed to only listen to that particular GUID at bind time.    That works great when nobody wants to cause problems, but it would be a simple matter to hack a transmitter to listen for what GUIDs are being transmitted and then let you pick one, and then it starts transmitting with that GUID.  Add a 100 watt transmitter instead of the default <1 watt transmitter, and now you've got control over the plane and the original pilot does not.  There's always the problem of having your transmitter not being programmed properly for the plane after that (control surfaces reversed and such) but even that could be worked out by a smart computer listening to the original transmitter's signals and comparing to what the craft actually does for a minute or two.  Side note: There was a bug in some DSM2 transmitters where you could reset the GUID for that TX to all zeros by turning it off at the wrong time during startup.  Your plane would still fly (after rebinding it), but if two transmitters ended up at the field with that problem, both would crash.  Spektrum gave hobby shops a device to detect the problem and they recalled the transmitters or something.  But unless DSMX added some encryption that I don't know about, I imagine that all of this is an option if somebody is sufficiently motivated.  (And using it to steal other people's aircraft might actually be sufficient motivation!)  And being US specific here, the US has laws regarding the export of encryption, as do other countries.  In fact, if Spektrum did add such encryption to their DSMX standard to prevent the hijacking scenario I mentioned, it might make the export of such gear illegal because it could also make it more useful for military purposes.  Of course, it's also possible that the Ukranians don't have any encryption at all on this (especially if they're using off the shelf consumer hardware), and they just used that phrase because they liked the sound of it.  edit:  To expand on this, note that ""secure"" probably does not mean ""reliable"" or ""jam proof"".  No matter what you do with your RF link, it can always be jammed -- no matter how much power you use or what sort of spread spectrum or whatnot, it's always possible that somebody else can use more power and cause your signal to not be received.  But while you can't prevent them from jamming your signal, you should be able to prevent them from eavesdropping or tampering with the signal (at least in an undetectable way) via encryption if you do things right.  Of course, if you design the entire system properly, it'll handle such a loss of valid signal gracefully, and will ignore any invalid signals/commands.  Also note that GPS cannot be relied upon to be unspoofed.  (Though perhaps the military has an encrypted version that can be relied upon, that can be jammed but not spoofed?)  Aircraft can be made with inertial guidance systems rather than or in addition to GPS, and that's harder to jam/spoof -- but it's also bigger and less accurate (especially over time) than a GPS receiver.  There was a US military drone that was supposedly hacked by Iran and taken intact -- it's said that it was hacked by jamming its control signal and spoofing GPS, though the US denies that that could have been done.  What really happened?  Got me."

radiocontrol,3bkxf6,dougmc,1 point,Tue Jun 30 02:09:42 2015 UTC,"I don't have the impression that this guy knows a lot about the technique used for the drones. He stated that they started with hobbyists parts, but just have a look at the engine: It's a standart combustion engine used for RC models. It has a simple wood prop. The design is similar to other high-tech drones, but it isn't optimized for a prop. This might give the impression for a high tech drone, but I don't think that a lot of effort went into it. Another good indicator is the landing gear, which can't be retracted. If you want an autonomous drone, you must have a very long flight time. And for this you can't accept any compromises. . So why the heavy wall of text? What I want to say is that the guy heavily overstates the tech used and the capibilities of the drone.  He's doing marketing for his drone. This means further: don't overthink what he's meaning with a ""secure digital connection"". All we can really say is that the drone will not use a standard transmitter similar to the ones we use (for the range alone). . To answer your question: let's just break it down: secure: I'd say that most of the systems we use are secure. They are vulnerable for jamming, but there's not much you can do with our 100mW transmitters against that. digital: Every 2.4 Ghz system used in transmitters are digital connection: I guess this one is self explanatory encrypted: DSMX relies on DSSS to transmit data, which always uses encryption. (Altough you can of course encrypt the transmitted data as well)"

radiocontrol,3biqhc,FantasyLiver,2,Mon Jun 29 15:42:15 2015 UTC,"Use hot glue and cellotape, it's all you need. You can cut little channels in the foam and stick some pine or balsa in there for added strength.   I'd rather not be sinking hundreds of dollars towards repairing this thing   You're doing something wrong if you feel that you'll have to spend hundreds. Hot glue is cheap. Foam-safe CA glue is also not that expensive. It doesn't expand so you can only fix small stuff with it, but it's much lighter than hot glue.  You can also use typical white glue (carpenter's glue, PA glue, it's the same thing).    However, my question is whether or not crashes like this happen often    That depends entirely on your skill. I spent a few weeks on simulators while I waited for parts from China, so I learned to control the thing way before I got it. As a result, I flew without an accident for many weeks, almost daily. First crash was because a wing servo gears decided to just fall apart."

radiocontrol,3bh9qu,silverwidow4,2,Mon Jun 29 05:19:30 2015 UTC,"Unless something's been unplugged I would say to leave that assembly alone for now. GPS return to home and other flight modes are triggered by switches on the transmitter, or combinations thereof. You can find out what it's set up to do by plugging the naza into your computer with the DJI NAZA assistant software (iirc there should be a micro-usb on the LED module). Yes, this is the main battery plug. It's possible your brother might have set it up to power some of the systems (I.e. camera gear) off a separate battery, but it depends how he set it up. 10x3.8 are quieter and more efficient, but only use them with 3s as 4s will draw too much current. The 8x4.5 props are good with 4s for some extra power, but they're quite noisy and will reduce your flight time. They also will not produce enough lift on 3s. I'd recommend the 10x3.8, but it depends what batteries you have. I don't know much about this, unfortunately. It's possible you could get it repaired by spectrum for a fee, or you might be able to DIY it with some replacement switches. I would recommend a 3s 4000 or 5000mah battery, at least 25c rated."
radiocontrol,3bh9qu,remotaholic,2,Mon Jun 29 06:22:45 2015 UTC,"Yea, I've followed all the wires and they seem to be right (he knew what he was doing... Woo-hoo!!) He was using a Gopro gimbal but its shot after a bad crash, needs new motors, other than that all wires / plug ports seem to be used and in their proper place, also found the Micro-usb port. Talked to him and he apparently set it up for FPV gear, but trashed it in a crash (on a different board/drone) so there was extra gear for FPV transmission. Thank you I'll contact Spectrum in the mornin and see what they say.... If they want like 60$ for a repair I'll just replace them myself.... I believe its just 'cut here, solder here'   FYI I currently have x3  Turnigy 2200mah 20C-30C rated, while not a long flite, I figure they would get me off the ground and hovering for a few minutes."

You really only need 1 three position switch that works to set your flight modes. you can set any switch to trigger rth as long as you have a position stored before you take of AND your fail safe is set correctly. Have you installed the naza assistant on your computer and hooked it up to make sure everything is right? Blades, anything from 8-10"" should be ok, you will break them so dont get too hung up on perfect thrust. 8"" for 4s and up to 10"" for 3s. Test it with the blades off, also check the fail safe with them off. Figure out how to set up the 3 flight modes on a 3 position switch. you need this to calibrate the fc (Naza Dance) i run everything from 2200-5000 3s and 4s on my bigger quads and 1000-2200 on my 250."

But collectively, for the RC community as a whole, I believe such a large data set can add real value.  Second, data entry must be as painless and quick as possible. Excel is probably not the best UI for that. A web application (or a native iphone/android app) can be designed to support workflows specific to each task. My goal is to make the app usable in the field, on mobile phones. I use QR codes to identifiy batteries.

I love my 9x, but I had to spend a couple evenings modifying it to get it close to the functionality of the Taranis (backlight, OpenTX) and I eventually put an XJT module in it because the FrSky link is much better than the Turnigy/FlySky protocol.  Get the Taranis. You'll thank yourself later. The DX6i is honestly not up to snuff compared to the either a Taranis or a 9x with FrSky module (and cost as much or more than either option.)"

radiocontrol,3baf7i,star_boy2005,4,Sat Jun 27 11:31:48 2015 UTC,"First is the lack of channels. Six just isn't enough for me, and for most people I fly with. Even if it's just a miniquad, being able to assign knobs to different gains, etc, is incredibly useful. Aileron differential, wingtip drag rudders on flying wings, all these become easy with extra channels and awesome transmitter firmware (see below!)  Second (although the latest generation of DX6 fixes this, I think) is the lack of ability to freely assign the trainer input...basically, makes it difficult/impossible to use headtracking with a DX6i.  Last I'll mention, the Taranis runs OpenTX, a phenomenal open-source firmware (my 9x has been modified to run it as well.) It's incredible...assign any physical knob to any channel, in a ridiculous array of ways/combinations. More software features than I can name, but still fairly intuitive to use. The online community for it is active and relatively large. You can do editing (and simulating of outputs) on your computer and download it to the transmitter, or back up all your transmitter models on your computer."

radiocontrol,3b22zc,kwaaaaaaaaa,2,Thu Jun 25 18:41:38 2015 UTC,"Does Seattle or Washington have any laws that would restrict this flight?  Did it happen within restricted airspace?  If neither is the case ... I'm not sure that there would be any permission to ask for.  Contrary to popular belief, advisory circular 91-57 is advisory and so does not make it illegal to exceed 400' AGL.  Even the AMA safety code (also not law) doesn't have such an altitude limit unless you're within three miles of an airport.  (That said, an actual restriction seems to be coming ... but it's not here yet.)  This story certainly didn't answer the question of legality, though the fact that he wasn't arrested or even cited does suggest something.  Here's his video.  This map shows the area, with the Space Needle being about 11 nautical miles north of the airport.  If I'm reading it right, one can fly up to 1800 feet AGL before running into restricted airspace near the Space Needle?  This map shows the area around the Space Needle being OK, though just a few miles South is not OK.  That said, the map doesn't cover local laws, just restricted airspace.  I certainly would agree that this might not be the best place to fly, but unless the answer to one of my questions was ""yes"", I imagine that this flight would be legal.  (And that said, I expect that such flights won't remain legal forever.)"
radiocontrol,3b22zc,dougmc,1 point,Thu Jun 25 22:10:26 2015 UTC,"I'm rusty on the current legality because the FAA won't make up their minds, but I remember reading last year a similar incident was because it broke 500ft and the needle observation deck is well above that height.

The guy wasn't arrested, wasn't cited, but the police did talk to him -- probably because they were told that his aircraft crashed into the landmark.  (It didn't.)  He agreed not to fly it there again, but as far as I can tell, the flight didn't actually break any laws.  And in fact, after it happened, Seattle said that they wanted laws against it, but it would mostly be up to the FAA.   because the FAA won't make up their minds   They would have to actually make up their minds to make something illegal.  I think an absolute altitude limit is coming (well, beyond the 18,000 foot controlled airspace limit), but it's not here yet."

radiocontrol,3b0u79,marcusdrifter,2,Thu Jun 25 03:48:33 2015 UTC,My turnigy lipos showed heavy degredation over the last winter (they are just over 1 year old). They're down to around 80% capacity and their internal resistance god very high. (But they are only the 30C version). Also check the C rating. There shouldn't have been any 6C or even 3C lipos for propulsion. (such low rated lipos are only used for transmitters or other things that consume very little power)

radiocontrol,3aza0a,delta590,3,Wed Jun 24 18:22:01 2015 UTC,"Your problem is that the video signal and the controls with the transmitter use 2.4Ghz. So you have a 2.4Ghz transmitter right next to your 2.4 Ghz receiver on the model. This causes a lot of interference for the receiver. No wonder that you're not getting a large range. There is no real budget solution. Get a ""real"" 2.4Ghz transmitter (I'd suggest the FrSky Taranis) Then use a 5.8 Ghz system for the video signal. This will grant you well over 1km for the control inputs. The video range depends heavily on the system you use."

That spike can deliver some high voltages, so I am using 50v capacitors for my 6s (21v-25.2v). Redundant 5v/12v power supply so that the flight controller, receiver, camera, gimbal, and transmitter can stay on during issues with the ubec.  Don't go for an expensive distance plane to start. You will not fly successfully. Cheap planes can do some serious long range. Invest in the radio equipment, take the time to study for the ham test, and play with something a bit less full on.

radiocontrol,3aza0a,0fx,2,Thu Jun 25 15:06:36 2015 UTC,"ez uhf, along with other uhf Tx, is a separate unit that you attach on to your radio, and replaces the Rx on your plane. Frequency of your radio does not matter, so you see some people using older 9 channel fm transmitters and what not.    For long range video people generally use 1.3 ghz or 900 mhz at 500-1000 mW. Keep in mind you are not going to get 1080p video over 1 mile away. Most people use a small security camera with osd to fly, and a separate camera like a contour or gopro to record HD video.    For long range flying a fixed wing glider type is generally recommended, as they can extend the range and battery life by gliding with the motor off.  If you are trying to extend the range of your quad, there's really no point in doing all this, as a quad will never fly far enough for a uhf system to have any advantage."
radiocontrol,3aza0a,snugglebandit,1 point,Wed Jun 24 22:53:36 2015 UTC,HobbyKing's OpenLRS products are an alternative to the EzUHF.

radiocontrol,3b03s0,tterev3,3,Thu Jun 25 01:38:09 2015 UTC,"It's possible to control multiple receivers with one controller. It's a one-way communication protocol so multiple receivers can't interfere with each other, or even know about each other.

If it wasn't TOO heavy, put out a lot of smoke, and didn't stand out like a sore thumb on the airframe I'd get excited about it."

I'll be designing the entire system, from reservoirs to the electrical system, so the only limiting factor will be component size. I should, in theory, be able to create something small enough to go on even the UMX series planes.   The idea is to make something that is indistinguishable from a FP smoke system in its smoke trails, is light, efficient, and doesn't require much power. I'd like to run it off a 2C battery. We'll see though. And this system will be designed to be housed in the fuselage, out of the way."

Normally the batteries have enough to give them at least a short time though we're starting to think it was an out of the box issue.  These are usually held in great regard in reviews and it seems odd it's damaged so soon. The rotors seem to be unable to be turned at all by the motor but the motor does seem to work, alternatively the resistance on the top motor isn't too intense but it's certainly a lot more."
radiocontrol,3al8gc,Tonkerino,3,Sun Jun 21 08:11:29 2015 UTC,"Radio troubleshooting:   Swap out servos/ESCs.  Does this fix the problem?  If not, continue Swap out Rx.  Does this fix the problem?  If not, continue Swap out locations (does this only happen at one specific field?) Does this fix the problem?  If not, continue Tx is bad   Reasons?    Servo jitter (buzzing) is usually caused by (impact) damaged potentiometers.  Cheapest way is replacing the servo.  This is a fairly common failure mode.  Most radio failures I've had are complete, that is, either on or off, not intermittent.  Also, here check battery leads/ESC leads.  I usually have a couple Rx's laying around to do a quick swap just to check though.  If you only have the one Rx, skip this, it's an expensive buy for a test of an unlikely failure source.  In the old days, radios for use in UK were on the 35MHz band and in the US, the 72MHz band.  the 35MHz was reserved for other things, using such a radio in the US risked the legal users of that band 'shooting down' your signal (likely on accident).  Now, in the 2.4GHz band, which is mostly unregulated, spurious signals from old/broken internet routers, cordless (handset, not cell) phones, and all other users are potential interference, though very range limited.  Don't just go out and buy a new one.  Check the battery/cable.  Put it on a multimeter and wiggle the wire around.  Static from the battery means poor computer performance.  Open up the case, check for poor solder joints (hazy, cracked, anything but bright and smooth).  Youtube how to solder for some visuals.  Could just be a 10 second soldering (probably on the battery cable) job to fix it all.   Now, go get a new Tx"
radiocontrol,3al8gc,dusty78,2,Sun Jun 21 12:08:12 2015 UTC,make sure the module on the back is fully seated.  After you do all the troubleshooting above you might flash the firmware to one of the open source versions available (i've been using ER9X and have never looked back).  That would be cheaper than buying a new TX outright if it works.
radiocontrol,3al8gc,KillerSpud,1 point,Sun Jun 21 14:21:53 2015 UTC,"Since the fault affected multiple servos and the ESC we can be sure that these are not the cause of the problem.

So yeah, $620 plus price of a go pro is a pretty good price for what I was expecting. Would this be a good build to go with if you wanted to skip the cheap first time flying and jump right into buying something you wouldn't regret buying? I prefer putting money in the first time rather than having to start all over again. Think of it as skipping to the middle of your hobby rather than starting out with that first $200 set.

radiocontrol,3ae14u,dmanww,1 point,Fri Jun 19 21:08:29 2015 UTC,"How easy would something like this be to implement?  I've been thinking of building a UGV out of an ATV or a golfcar or something similar, limiting it to only maybe 15 km/h and with bumper that activates a kill switch in case it drives into something."
radiocontrol,3ae14u,RaccoNooB,1 point,Sat Jun 20 12:02:17 2015 UTC,"Well the hardest part is the actuators on the propel and steer.  If the system is already electrically driven. (Like a hydraulic skid steer) then it is really easy.  If it is not electrically driven, then the hardest part is mounting a system to make it electrically driven."
radiocontrol,3ae14u,ShadowRam,1 point,Sat Jun 20 13:44:30 2015 UTC,"An all electric system would be the easiest way of doing it. I wouldn't even need steering as it could drive like a tank.  But I would really like it to be gas powered since I can keep it running for much longer and can also refuel it. A hybrid would be the absolute best option since I get the benefits from the electric motors, while being able to refuel it anywhere and quickly. I haven't looked into how difficult that would be though.  Honestly, if I can find a quad with power steering, I could have a servo pull the throttle cable, and a strong stepper motor turn the handle bars.  I wouldn't really keep the handle bars though. Strip it of anything not mechanical and weld a new ""case"" for it. I'm thinking of something like the AMSTAFF UGV, but with 4 wheels and the front ones turning. It's never going to be as pretty as that thing, but the idea is to have it function in a similar way.     I know the principles behind how I get it to go where I want it, but I'm worried about interference with other signals making it do weird things or simply not responding. I plan on having a bunch of kill switches on easy to reach places to kill engine power, but if I can stop it from happening all together that would be the best. I'm not planning on having it travel far from me. It sounded like you knew of a way too keep it from becoming sentient once it's able to move and so that's why I asked."
radiocontrol,3ae14u,RaccoNooB,2,Sat Jun 20 14:41:49 2015 UTC,"Today's radio's are digital. Where commands are encoded and error checked, and identifiers are used to verify the signal is coming from the correct controller.   So you can't get radio interference that would cause unwanted motion. It's not possible.   If there is too much radio interference the system just stops receiving commands.  You also have a heartbeat setup as well. Where the transmitter is sending out commands (even if they are zero) every so often.  You pre-program the machine to stop if it losses that heartbeat signal.  For an Ackerman steering application, yes you can hook up a strong actuator that will either physically move the bar, or in some cases a hydraulic cylinder is what moves the steering, and you can hook up an electric motor to the steering valve."
radiocontrol,3ae14u,ShadowRam,1 point,Wed Jun 24 15:23:58 2015 UTC,That's pretty cool. That's REALLY fucking cool actually.  So what sort of radio malfunctions can I expect? Loosing the signal and have it stop responding is the only one I can think of atm.
radiocontrol,3ae14u,RaccoNooB,2,Wed Jun 24 16:00:17 2015 UTC,"That's basically it. Since it's digital. You either you are connected or you are not.  Example, some people pre-program their drones that when connection to the radio transmitter is lost, it can do a few things.  Auto-Hover in place.  Auto-Hover and the slowly descend straight down.  or go to set altitude, return to 'home' GPS co-ordinates and then Auto-Hover and descend."
radiocontrol,3ae14u,ShadowRam,2,Wed Jun 24 17:59:10 2015 UTC,"the controller is too poor, I think you shouldn't buy it... or maybe buy it with another controller, but that will come up more expensive, would not recommend for a beginner"

radiocontrol,3aeabb,bigred326,3,Fri Jun 19 13:42:24 2015 UTC,I'll be making a new larger wing (I think one the text bubbles in there says that) which should drastically change the wing loading value.

They have plans for planes you can build with white foam board that will cost you maybe $1 per board ($1-2 per plane).
radiocontrol,3aeabb,galorin,2,Fri Jun 19 19:23:35 2015 UTC,"I think the easiest ways to cut you're weight are to move to a 2S Lipo with lower mAh capacity and a smaller motor with a higher Kv rating.

The servos are too big too. 6g servos would be more than adequate.  Better yet, if you can get the esc/radio/servo block  that comes standard in all micro planes (e.g., Parkzone um P-51) you could save a ton of weight.

As others have said, please watch flite test videos.these are good parts for a slightly larger model. Your biggest issue here is the battery and motor and esc. There is just no room.

My plan to extend the wing was to cut through the top of the fuselodge (the wing is in a slot, that gets slid through), through to the wing slot, expand the slot back. I'm planning to reinforce the length of the fuselodge with a piece of arrow shaft. I will use that to mount a new larger wing to, most likely hot wire cut from insulation foam then reinforced to the max for strength and durability.  Probably going to destroy a few innocent chuckers in the process, but for $7 each the price is just right in my books!"
radiocontrol,3a9j04,Thomas9002,2,Fri Jun 19 00:29:41 2015 UTC,"I can tell you with certainty that that is too much weight. that little glider would be happy with something like a ""250 quad size"" motor, 10 amp speed control, 4 x servos 5 grams or smaller, and a 500 3s or smaller. The wings, even if they're reinforced will not support that weight.   I'd suggest starting off by following plans by flitetest, experimental airlines on youtube first or dig around rcgroups.com. If you want to fly around 700-800 grams, you'll need a lot more wing area.   All that said, where did you get that glider? I want one."

That one will be near impossible to fit all of your electronics in and the tail will be too short and small for a plane that needs a 50-60"" wingspan. Just my words of advice but that plane will never be suitable for your goals. If you want to make a new wing for it, I'd just go ahead and make a new fuselage as well. That's just me though.  A plane the size of a Bixler or so is one that's designed for 700-800 grams AUW. Sorry if this comes off as harsh.  Thanks for letting me know where you got it!"

radiocontrol,3a9j04,pbostrom,1 point,Thu Jun 18 14:26:11 2015 UTC,You must only use one BEC per model. If you use more than one they'll fry each other. Also bear in mind that these are the cheapest BECs you can get anywhere. They aren't very failure resistant and the voltage drops heavily under loads. I wouldn't connect more than 4 micro servos to that BEC.  It's much better to invest in a good BEC
radiocontrol,3a9j04,galorin,1 point,Thu Jun 18 20:19:46 2015 UTC,I had no idea they would fry each other! But just more reason to have a bunch on hand when I inevitably let the smoke out of a few.  What about the BEC in the ESC? Will it kill another BEC in the circuit?  So I guess the right idea is more to have one really big BEC to take care of everything reliably!
radiocontrol,3a9j04,MarshallX,2,Thu Jun 18 20:36:07 2015 UTC,"What about the BEC in the ESC? Will it kill another BEC in the circuit?   Yes, but you can circumvent this by taking the small red cable from the ESC  out of the servo plug. (Take a needle to bend the plastic up, then pull on the cable. Make some shrink tube over it so you won't get a short) This disconnects the ESCs BEC from the receivers power circuit.   So I guess the right idea is more to have one really big BEC to take care of everything reliably!   Correct. .

The BEC is oversized for a T-Rex 500, but there's no better BEC available for the same price. You also need a better BEC for helicopters,  because the Servos can generate high peaks and the voltage must stay stable.  Otherwise the FBL System may restart"
radiocontrol,3a9j04,boomertsfx,1 point,Fri Jun 19 06:08:52 2015 UTC,"Yes. When using multiple ESCs that all have BECs built in, you need to disconnect the power (middle) wire from all but one of the ESCs. If using a BEC, all ESC power wires should be removed."

I would connect a high resistance load (like a big wattage, 500-1k ohm resistor) and leave it in the dirt for a long time untill the whole battery reads 0v. Then depending on your local laws you'll probably be able to dispose of it in regular trash."

Flew this plane and after nearly a full successful second flight, as i was bringing her back in I flipped my senses and dropped 30 feet straight into the mud. I hit so hard she bounced 3 feet back into the air. Every piece was broken except the rudder. Even the little pilot bailed. Bent the battery.

If one cell has vented, you may not have voltage at the main discharge lead. You may need to manually discharge each of the remaining cells via the balance lead. Because you know that the pack is damaged, be sure to discharge the pack somewhere completely fire safe. Once the pack is discharged, it is safe to throw in the trash, although it would be more responsible to recycle it. You can take batteries in for recycling at many big-box hardware stores."

I highly recommend going the scratchbuild route. For example, take a look at the fury flyer. A couple bucks worth of foam, a few servos, and a motor and you can crash and rebuild it as many times as you need to."

Hes no pro with the multis but flew the bonsai with no problem. Its a perfect beginner plane when setup on the mild side. Use the turnigy park 250 motor and a 5x3 prop. 800mah 2 cell and a 10a esc.  Dial in your dual rates to be at 65% or 70% and plan to have to give it some up trim on the first take off. Put a 5x4.3 prop on once you get used to it and want more power. Its a $25 dollar piece of foam with the motor in the back. If you crash hard you can glue it back together. The only bad this plane has is the control links. I made one peice z-bend wires instead of using the 3 peice linkages it came with. highly recommend it with the above setup, even for a beginner."

My advise is to keep it light as possible because you'll probably be crashing quite a lot and the heavier it is, the more will break. I use a zmr 1804 motor, 10a ESC, 5030 prop and 3s 460mah battery and it flew first time without and messing about with cg. It has crashed a lot and required very little glue. The control rods that come in the box are horrible. I replaced with a single piece of wire with z bend on one end and linkage stoppers on the servo arms."

I also put together a Royal Air 20H ARF.   I'm somewhat at a loss for how current fellow flyers can marvel at a factory molded plane for its detail.  I figure that if you see one, you've seen them all versus either cutting balsa and plywood or kit assembling and covering.  Anyhow, the barrier is certainly lowered for getting into the hobby.   3D aerobatics didn't exist back then and I'm sure people wouldn't have pushed that envelope as much if they all had to handbuild everything from nearly scratch."

With paint it got heavier and tail heavy so I had to add counterweight in the nose, adding even more weight. The counterbalance is the black piece you see attached under the prop where the mouth is. Attached with magnets to make it possible to remove it when extracting the power pod.  I've only had one proper flight with it with the new paint and weight. Needs quite a lot more speed now. All up weight is now 1200g. This model should be max 800g if built with the ""correct"" foam. So now I really need the power. I think it is just enough, but I do have to keep much higher throttle to cruise.

(Remember, if it's to help a car start -- it's claiming 400 amps at around 12 volts, almost 5000 watts.)  ... which is still possible, but very unlikely, especially for a consumer device that small, and it's flat out impossible if it's a 1s 13Ah battery that requires a DC to DC converter.  Looking through the comments on the item itself, it seems to have a 3s 4400mAh battery in it instead of a 1s 13Ah one.  But given the size of this thing ... no frickin way can it put put 400 amps as 12 volts.  The cables and plugs are certainly part of it, but they're not the only thing preventing that.  That said, if it can put out 20 amps for a minute or two, it could charge up a car battery a little bit and let you start it.  But 400 amps is fiction."

That said, if it can put out 240 watts (20 amps at 12 volts) for a minute, that may be enough to get the car's battery going enough that it can start the car on its own.

We're not talking for any period of time; we're talking literally for a moment, not even a second, but milliseconds.

Not a good plan for a consumer device, though at least the short cable ensures that it'll be in the engine compartment rather than in the car itself.  They seem to use a standard EC3 plug, which is rated at 60 amps continuous.  There's a fuse in their jumping cable, but I can't tell what its rated amperage is -- but I suspect it's less than 400 amps.  (But even if it's 100 amps, it could permit 400 amps for a few milliseconds, as you suggested.)  Either way, even if it can help you start a car (you don't need 400 amps for that -- 20 amps will do that) ... it's probably not a very good fit for what the OP wants, unless he's charging tiny batteries.

radiocontrol,39xz2b,GoldenShadowGS,1 point,Tue Jun 16 13:41:57 2015 UTC,"You could just get a fairly large 3s LiPo cell -- 5000 mAh or or bigger -- and use it to power your LiPo charger (most run on 11-15 volts, after all) and then plug your charger into the wall or your 12v supply and then charge your source battery when you get home for your next flying trip.  As for if that's big enough, that depends on what you're charging.  If you're charging 2s or 3s cells, the capacity used will be approximately equal to the battery charged, so a 3s 5000 mAh pack will charge a 2s or 3s 2500 mAh pack almost twice (but not quite.)  If you're charging 4s or more packs ... it'll use even more of your capacity.  If you need more than 10,000 mAh, it'll probably be significantly cheaper to just get a 10 Ah or bigger gel cell battery.  Heavier, but cheaper.  But this thing that you've found doesn't look like it's a good fit for the money -- it's probably got a 1s 13.6 Ah battery inside (assuming that they're not lying!) so that's roughly equivalent to a 3s 4000 mAh battery.

radiocontrol,39rv8p,nemisis_25,1 point,Sun Jun 14 15:42:07 2015 UTC,I basically just attached the existing control lines to servos and set them up as elevons with mixing on the transmitter. Didn't fly long enough to get a good idea of operating time or performance but it was definitely an improvement on the stock version. A brushless motor will be more efficient than a brushed motor but you'll probably have to modify/build a mount for it if it's not exactly the same size as the existing motor so it depends how much work you want to put into it.
radiocontrol,39rv8p,kwaaaaaaaaa,1 point,Thu Jun 18 05:33:53 2015 UTC,"From the parts list, it looks like it uses 6 NiMh batteries, so 7.2v. I suppose you can get away with a 2 cell lipo @ 7.4v.

The 300 will take about 5 amps and the 400 will take about 10 amps, but anything more and they will burn out quickly. Even at that power, the push-on props often need to be glued on. These motors were very cheap, and quite inefficient (especially at 3s) so you might be better to consider going brushless from the start.  If that wing was designed for 2 channels, adding ailerons won't do much as the wing has too much stability built-in. You really need a flat wing for ailerons.   An elevator will be useful though; once you've got it flying, experiment with moving the CG back gradually to make it more responsive."

radiocontrol,39qhw1,gyrnik,1 point,Sun Jun 14 00:43:55 2015 UTC,"keep lipos in a fire safe containers.   All the time, or just while charging them?  I've just been keeping them in the retail box the quad came in..."
radiocontrol,39qhw1,Wrobot_rock,2,Sat Jun 13 22:58:27 2015 UTC,"Ideally all the time. I'll admit I don't always keep them in a safe container but you really should. Sometimes (very rarely though) they self combust and can cause serious damage. However, even a puffed up lipo can still be safe and work well.  The main cause of catastrophic failure is a puncture or severe mischarging. I have a lipo pouch. Its not much work to toss them in there for storage or charging. You can see videos online showing how they contain the fire. Charging multicell lipos without proper balancing greatly increases the chance of failure though.   You're dealing with pretty small batteries. These safety measures are much more important with batteries that have 10-100x the storage capacity. Those batteries can burn down your entire house or car."
radiocontrol,39qhw1,Wrobot_rock,1 point,Sat Jun 13 23:50:12 2015 UTC,"Those are 1s batteries and there's nothing to balance. Others have touched on it, but it was probably a voltage difference (fully charged info a discharged)."
radiocontrol,39qhw1,psychometrixo,1 point,Sun Jun 14 04:11:50 2015 UTC,"As /u/pheyd69 said, what happened is one of the batteries was at a different voltage than the others. When you connect them in parallel, they will all balance each other to the same voltage.   So if one battery was at 11.6v and the other two were 11.2v, the one battery would discharge the .4 volts of capacity as fast as it can, the equivalent current draw of a short circuit.   When you discharge more current than the battery is rated for, permanent damage occurs. This damage usually produces a gas that gets trapped in the cell, which is what makes them puffy. In a 3 cell, if one cell has lower internal resistance than the others it may have discharged even faster than the rest and be the only puffy one. Often charging them will dissolve the gas back in to the cell, but the damage is still done and the battery is just as dangerous as before, even more so with the additional energy you put in to it through charging.   As others said, its probably best to discard the battery in a safe way. Shooting it or puncturing the cell in any way will likely release a cloud of smoke and jet of fire, so don't do that. Or just don't blame me if you injure yourself. The fire comes from the lithium reacting with the moisture in the air, so don't plan on using water to put it out if you decide to pop it by the way"
radiocontrol,39qhw1,psychometrixo,1 point,Sun Jun 14 16:31:17 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the reply.  All of this is quite the education.  I'm surprised that this battery charging business is so potentially dangerous, I've never heard these warnings before.  Here's the charger that came with my quad:  Should I be as careful charging with this thing, too, charging just two at a time?  I noticed that the plastic on this charger gets ""warm"" while it's working, but the batteries themselves do not.  What would you suggest as the best method for charging five batteries at once?  Thanks."
radiocontrol,39qhw1,psychometrixo,1 point,Sun Jun 14 00:06:18 2015 UTC,"The plastic gets warm for one of two reasons. A single lipo cell charges to 4.2v, and USB runs at 5. To step down the voltage either a switching voltage regulator is used, where it turns the power on and off very fast. If its on for 80% of the time it produces an average of 4 volts (.8x5). This is how pulse width modulation works. Capacitors and inductors are used to make it a steady 4v rather than an oscillating 5v.   The cheaper way of doing this is by making a voltage divider using only resistors. The extra energy is released in the form of heat from the resistor.   If your charger uses a voltage divider to get the right voltage that's where the heat is coming from. It's not bad, just not ideal. Of it uses a switching regulator then the heat is coming from the wires and circuitry of the device, also something to be expected when charging. Either way, if it gets too hot to touch I wouldn't use it anymore because it may be faulty.   As for charging multiple batteries at once, you could put some large resistors between the batteries and charge them in parallel or search for a charger that has separate charging circuits for each battery like this one obviously more than you need but its to give you and idea"

Do the two flashes change to 3 if you press the bind button three times in a row? And then what if you do that again?  On mine, the number of flashes indicates the DSM mode and pressing the bind button three times causes it to cycle between the four modes one at a time.  Something like DSM2 11ms, DSM2 22ms, DSMX 11ms, DSMX 22ms, if I recall. These are indicated by 0, 1, 2, and 3 flashes respectively.

If you re-enforce the tail that'll mess up the center of gravity and a little weight in the tail means you need several times that weight in the front -- so the battery may go ahead of the CoG.  Use pushrods to control the tail rather than trying to put the servos back there, because of the CoG thing I just mentioned.  Getting the right CoG is key for a job like this.  But really, just make it look like a foam glider and have the CoG right and it'll probably work."

That's a pretty small glider, so you'll need tiny gear -- a small RX, small servos, narrow push rods, etc.  Really, a larger plane might be a lot better for a first shot -- one of those with a 4 or so foot wing span.  But for yours, perhaps a 3s 500 mAh battery and a 10 amp ESC and a 5 amp motor or so with an appropriate prop (the motors tend to suggest props, so use what it suggests.)

The only place in your home that is safe to store lipos would be inside the oven, and it will still vent a ton of gas and make a mess (but you won't burn the place down).  Ideal situation is a concrete floor or put down some fireproof board like they use in construction, and cinder blocks. You could use a metal open top container like a garbage pail or ammo can, but covering it is a bad idea. Instead find an area where there is nothing flammable within a few feet above and beside, so it won't set fire to any structure. Even better if you can vent the gas, i.e. outdoors but obviously not exposed to the elements. Get a chemical fire extinguisher!  I know this is super tedious but you should see what your house looks like after a lipo fire.

Currently I'm using some 16 in. x 8 in. x 4 in. concrete blocks arranged in a square. Inside the space I've put some sand and on top 2 2x4's with a full bag of sand resting above that. The thought is that if they catch on fire the bag of sand will burst and put out the fire. I put my lipos in a ""lipo-safe"" bag and put the bag inside this ""bunker"" while they charge. (this is all in my garage BTW)  Lately I've been thinking of a more elegant solution. If a smoke/fire detector can be rigged up to trigger a hatch where sand is above, it can release sand into this space and put out the fire. At the same time the alarm can go off to alert you.  What do you guys think?"

A better solution would be to drill a few holes into the ammo can and then place it somewhere, where it can't ignite something else. The other mistake: Why did hell did he wrap it in !!!12!!! layers of fiberglass cloth? As I said before: It's not a good idea to contain any of the gases. You have to make the ventilation as easy as possible. By wrapping 12 layers of fibre cloth around the lipo he causes 2 problems: - the air can't vent freely because it has to go around the cloth. And 2nd, and much more important: The lipo expands before exploding. And when the gas vents out it increases the pressure as well: The cloth gets pushed against any holes for ventilation (including his 12"" pipe): And very nice: You're trapping flamable gas inside a closed container.

(They can even be used together, and some R/C things that call themselves FHSS may use both.)  Either way, these are technologies, not products or standards, used by a great many things.  That said, companies have taken these technologies and built products and standards on them and then sometimes call them by similar or the same names, which can cause confusion.  I was mapping the R/C variations to to the technologies -- FASST uses the technology called FHSS (and I think it was the first in the hobbyist R/C market to do so on a wide scale at a reasonable price), but that doesn't mean it's compatible with others that use the technology called FHSS.

One time I visited a speed event. I shit you not: A goblin helicopter reared up while beeing over 200 km/h (over 120mph). This means the heli takes up its nose (without any input from the pilot). So since the pilot was flying at a very high RPM and around 15 degree of pitch the helicopter stopped in a split second. And it somehow survived

radiocontrol,3962y7,SuperFrodo,2,Tue Jun 9 14:59:34 2015 UTC,"DO NOT, repeat DO NOT buy it.  wall of rant text incoming.  Firstly, let me establish that I now have about a years experience flying gliders, not DLGs, gliders, but anyway.  I thought it was a bargain, and picked one up last week.  It arrived, and straight out of the box there were problems; firstly, the entire tail section was attached at an angle. I'm not sure if this would have drastically affected flight characteristics, but I decided to fix it anyway. It was 15 mins work, so nothing bad, but annoying nontheless.  Next, I noticed that the canopy wouldn't stay attached. Ok, fine, a few rubber bands fixed that.  Anyway, the first few flights were ok, I had to spend a lot of time finding the CG and weighing it down (one AAA battery in the nose did the trick). However, after about 30 mins of flying, I noticed that a huge crack had formed along the fuselage, from where the wings were attached to the body.   This looked really really bad, so I requested a replacement from hobbyking. 5 days later they didnt get back to me and I was DESPERATE to fly, so I spent about an hour delicately fixing the fuselage, at this point just wishing I had built a proper DLG.  So, after fixing it, I went to fly it again. Then get this, on one of the first proper discus throws, the plastic canopy SPLIT IN HALF, and threw the battery out, so the plane soared up about 40 feet, with no control, then nosedived HARD into the ground.splitting the wing right down the middle.  I was pissed, but I had now invested so much time and money into this thing that I committed to doing whatever I could to repair it.  I spent about 1.5 hours designing a 3D replacement for the shattered broken wing connector, and then 3D printed it, which took 2 hours. I reattached everything, painstakingly gluing and repairing.  After that, it turned out my repair actually seemed to be MORE RIGID than the original construction, so it was less loose, and just better.  Anyway, so today I decided to try out my repairs, and it was great, in fact, I would go as far as to say that it was BETTER, more rigid, than the original.  But then guess what happened. I had a slightly hard landing, and the tail completely broke off...  I quite literally gave up on the spot. I've never regretted buying something so much in my life."

radiocontrol,3937n6,wolfcry0,1 point,Tue Jun 9 05:32:00 2015 UTC,"But then you hobble yourself when you go to learn something that requires fine throttle/collective control or some other type of multi flying.  Learn how to deal with various types of lift manually then you'll be in a better position to fly anything easier (like hovering a helicopter, plane, or multi without that hold).  But I guess I'm old school.  Any other type of flying requires all kinds of fine stick movements on throttle/collective.  3D flying (plane or heli) requires the throttle/collective to be moved full positive and negative very quickly."

So, first of all, the big Turingy controller is not their controller. We bought many servos from them and in one of the packages they added a sticker label we just placed on top of our receiver.  The receiver is just a plain old 8 channel receiver. We use it for servos and engines. Gear box (manual) is controlled via 2 servos (about 40kg), throttle control is done via a small 5kg servo. When it comes to the heavy stuff, the cluch and the driving weel are controlled via an H bridge VNH3SP30 board connected to more powerful engines. In example the driving wheel is connected to the engine taken out from a cheap hand drill :-)  I'll be happy to explain more if anyone is interested Cheers!"

radiocontrol,38y2ts,psychometrixo,2,Mon Jun 8 00:59:36 2015 UTC,"Partially this is true - sometimes we find it hard to straighten the steering wheel, we still work on it. The reason is that my father assembled his own hydraulic power steering, otherwise we wouldn't be able to control the wheel at all - this tractor is really old and requires bit of strength. So because of that custom power steering we found that the profile of turning is not linear - steering to the left is a bit better than steering to the right (I don't want to go into much details here, but this is mostly because of the amount of fluid in the pump that stays there after turn). You won't spot this when you drive manually, but for the R/C it really matters. Now we experiment with the separate resistors to control the H bridge better. Day after we made this film it went much smoother, but the work is still in progress. Thanks for your input!"

radiocontrol,38zwhm,galorin,1 point,Mon Jun 8 05:59:44 2015 UTC,"I see a few problems with your idea... That particular quad combines the receiver, speed controllers and gyroscopic stabilizer into one unit.  In order to replace the receiver with one that has greater range, you would need to put in four speed controllers, a new receiver, and your own gyroscope if you wanted to maintain any semblance of stability.  I just don't think that thing has the room or the payload capacity required to make those modifications.  So that's option A out.  For option B, transmitters don't really work quite that way.  However - see this page for a list of recommended compatible transmitters from the quad's manufacturer. Getting one of those may well increase your range over whatever transmitter came with the bird, if you got it in the RTF kit.  You may be able to do something like give the copter a better antenna... but that's quite risky and deals with a lot of delicate electronics.  That thing is also tiny.  How do you expect to be able to see it to fly it past the ranges you do get?"

I suggest this because it lends greater configurability (each servo can be adjusted individually for various settings like throw and center).

radiocontrol,38y8in,TwistedInferno,1 point,Mon Jun 8 01:28:49 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, since it doesn't look like it's a programmable transmitter, that option won't work for you. The Y-cable will be your only option unless you replace the transmitter.  You may also need a servo reverser, depending on how you mounted the servos on the aircraft. If both the control arms are on the inward or outward side you should be good; if they're both on the left or right side you'll probably want to re-mount the servo."
radiocontrol,38y8in,SoPoOneO,2,Mon Jun 8 03:13:20 2015 UTC,You need a Y servo lead. It takes the signal from the receiver and splits it so the servos for the ailerons work together but opposite.
radiocontrol,38y8in,trekkie00,3,Sun Jun 7 22:04:32 2015 UTC,"Right. I was confused about this when I started too. Plugged through a Y-harness into one receiver channel, the two servos will actually move in unison, the same direction. But because they get mounted in opposite directions on the wing, the effect is that one's push corresponds to the other's pull."
radiocontrol,38y8in,atomicrobomonkey,2,Mon Jun 8 00:37:38 2015 UTC,Amazon link for option 1 and option 2 since it will undoubtedly be faster than HobbyKing shipping.
radiocontrol,38y8in,galorin,1 point,Mon Jun 8 03:16:07 2015 UTC,This is the best I could find.  Gives a pretty good set of photos on how to do it.  All my old planes work like this.  Only they use rods and not the wire. As the servo arm moves to one side it pushes on that side and pulls on the other.  Resulting in one aileron going up and the other going down.  I'd send picks of mine but it's all hidden in the wings. http://supercubclub.proboards.com/thread/3099/single-servo-ailerons

What I mean by this is that it will require a larger space and faster airspeeds to fly, while something like The Champ will be more casual and slow.

You'll want to make sure there is no trim on the transmitter and then make sure the control surfaces are level with the rest of the plane (or what it says in the owners manual!).   If (b), and the surfaces look like they're moving right on the ground, then it might be an issue with the center of gravity of the aircraft. Take a look at it, is everything aligned correctly? Nothing bent? Double check to make sure that, after you put the battery in, the aircraft balances to where the owners manual indicates - generally speaking, at roughly 25% of the chord (wing ""length"" from leading edge to trailing edge).  Like I said, I'm not the most experienced with troubleshooting, so if you have any other description of what's happening it would be helpful. It looks like it's a very small aircraft, so it might even be an issue with the wind speed."

radiocontrol,38qooc,spsheridan,14,Sat Jun 6 00:22:55 2015 UTC,"Firefighter and rc enthusiast. At first I had mixed feelings about this, but after reviewing the entire video I have to side with the responders.  The operator initially kept a good distance from the scene. However shortly before the incident he started flying in really close. As we hobbyists are aware with our wide angle lenses ""objects in frame are closer than they appear"". He sustained a hover damn near rooftop level for quite some time and approached very close to the structure.  The primary consideration for these firefighters in this situation is probably noise. Yeah we use noisy equipment in the fire service, and we make use of radios, but the majority of fire scene communication is the old fashioned way. Plus our hearing while wearing all that protective gear and SCBA is severely hampered. It is important to be able to hear what your fellow firefighters are saying, listening to auditory que's from your equipment as well as the sounds of what is going on to the structure around you. To have what is probably a decent sized multirotor buzzing only about 30 feet over your head while you're trying to listen to and focus on what is going on during a live interior fire, that's adding an element of difficulty that doesn't need to be there and goes beyond a tolerable inconvenience. In fact, look at the Chief (white helmet) communicating with the other firefighters and finally the firefighter on the balcony. You can see in the seconds before the spray happens that that is what the Chief intended for the hose line operator to do, but notice how long it took to relay that message. Shouting and listening with your face in a respirator is bad enough, never mind a noisy multirotor overhead.  The model operator should have used better judgement and kept his distance. Saying he is going to try to get the dept to pay for damages is laughable. He was very arguably interfering with active firefighting operations during an IDLH environment over property he had no permission to be over and he kept doing so even after a blatant demonstration that it was not welcome.  If I were him in that situation I'd keep my mouth shut, walk away with whatever damage I received, and take it as a lesson. As is he will be lucky if the fire marshals don't insist on pursuing charges after he insisted on making a big deal of it."
radiocontrol,38qooc,VoteThemAllOut,3,Sat Jun 6 04:42:46 2015 UTC,The deal is the firefighters actions made them liable for replacing the phantom.  The proper action would of been to get an officer to go over to the operator and have him move it away from the scene.

radiocontrol,38qooc,birdphilosopher,3,Sat Jun 6 12:06:20 2015 UTC,"But what about the dangers of shooting down a helicopter? Where will it fall?   Really now? We hobbyists crash our models all the time. If the operator is so concerned about safety he wouldn't have approached the scene so close anyway. Besides, if this guy had any genuine concern for safety or his equipment, he would have immediately landed after receiving a direct hit to lessen the chance of losing control in the air and to have a chance to inspect his model. The fact he just kept flying tells me he really doesn't give two shits.   Submerging LiPo batteries in water is also the least firemen-like thing I can think of at the moment. A LiPo fire started in a grassy field that just got a toasty convection treatment from the upwind house fire is not on my list of ""top 10 things to do when annoyed by a drone"".   One, I think you are conveniently overblowing the dangers of a model getting sprayed. If it got wet enough to cause a serious problem, which it didn't, it would probably short out some component in short order and crash nearby. The risk of fire for a wet battery is still low. You can google search questions from our sea and land based brothers about wet batteries. Tons of people have had it happen and rarely does it cause problems. Even if a short did catch fire, those hoses the firefighters are carrying around are each capable of flowing at least 200 gallons per minute. If they can knock down a heavily involved house fire, pissing on a lipo is chump change. Also vegetation in a fire like this is likely to be unaffected as most of the heat rises with the smoke, which the model sustained a hover in for quite some time.  Secondly, you're coming at this from the perspective of an informed hobbyist. Most layman's are going to look at that model and think ""oh expensive toy"" and treat is as such, a toy. How many incidents do we hear about when people who are ignorant about these models do something that takes them down only to result in an injury. That is not on the individuals on the ground, it is on the operator. We have to understand the safe operations of our aircraft and how that relates to people on the ground who are unfamiliar. Never assume Joe Public understands the hazards posed by your model, that's on you. The best way to ensure everyone's safety is to maintain as much control over the model as possible, and that includes flying above the level of ""ground interference"" so to speak. Similarly even firefighters aren't going to be aware of the types of batteries in our models and their characteristics. People get their phones wet all the time, and they tend to break, not to explode or catch fire. Why should the average person expect an ""rc toy"" to be different?   I'm just kind of miffed because the firemen responded in the least mature way. Perhaps they had some justification. But they could have easily walked out front instead. They obviously weren't busy since three of them could take the time for target practice.   Then how would you have liked them to respond? They had a great deal of justification. They're operating in a hazardous environment. If someone had walked 30 feet from the firefighters and decided to do a spot of weedwhacking they would have been told to piss off too. The difference here is how do you say ""piss off"" to a flying model? What are you talking about ""they could have walked out front""? Did you even watch the video? He took off from several houses down the street. How are the firefighters expected to know where the operator is? It is likely the operator didn't even bother to approach the scene until after he was sprayed at, I mean why else would he have?   The operator should have taken a hint when responders repeatedly turned their attention away from the structure to look at the model. It's distracting at best. The only thing the firefighters could be docked for is not waving it away, but again think of it from their perspective, how do they know what the camera is focused on at that particular moment? The media paints a picture that these things can zoom in on you entering your code on your home alarm system. Short of lying down and spelling put ""Go away"" with their bodies whadya expect.  As far as saying they weren't busy, I don't expect you to know any more about firefighting than they knew about drones, but suffice to say crews are frequently swapped out and put on standby for rehab or rapid intervention in case the folks inside run into problems. Also when operating a hoseline at extreme angles, such as shooting very high, the more people you have to brace it, the better.  Ultimately I think it is important to take away this is yet another example of a model operator failing to use good judgement in maintaining distance from something they don't need to be near. Furthermore, by continuing to operate the aircraft in close proximity after being sprayed, the operator demonstrated a lack of concern for how his flying impacted responders on the ground, and a lack of concern for the state of his equipment and the potential for unintended operation.  That's my input."

If he was standing next to the fire chief, I bet they would have just told him to bring it down and go home.

radiocontrol,38qooc,Cin3va,6,Sat Jun 6 02:10:17 2015 UTC,"They fired their first hose from the 2nd floor of the house.  How ""active"" is this fire?  Come on.  When they decided to fire, they had nothing better to do than worry about who is watching them.  By that point, they were just gawking around, with one or two guys actually doing something.  I do think that all these ""community reporters"" need to get a new hobby and stop pretending they're ""helping the community.""  But at the same time, I don't think any government workers should be trying to destroy people's stuff just because they don't like that they're being watched.  The exception is if the quad is actually over them (safety) or causes some sort of interference (noise?)  But ultimately, there IS value is recording events.  This is why people record cop interactions/arrests.  And increasingly, police departments are getting body cameras."

Also the first guy to fire at the quad was spraying down the upstairs ceiling moments before aiming at the quad. Both lead me to believe they were still busy working, beyond that I won't assume to know how firefighters do their job.  I also worry that if the quad moved directly over the house, it would start pushing alot of fresh air directly onto a smouldering fire which could re-light some of the embers.   Yes there is value in recording events, but other than a possible payout from a media source, where is the value in recording a house fire? Do the home owners need protection from the fire dept?"

radiocontrol,38qooc,birdphilosopher,2,Sat Jun 6 12:03:17 2015 UTC,"""I don't think any government workers..."" What difference does it make if they are government workers or not, besides the majority of firefighters in the U.S. are still volunteers. Also being watched is not their concern. News media literally listen to our radios to chase after us and get footage. Huge crowds gather with cell phone cameras poised for anything from a working fire to someone who fell and needs help getting up. The only concern we have in such situations is privacy for our patients or victims. Firefighters are used to bring watched. You sound a bit indignant taxpayery.   Apparently by your own admission, you didn't actually watch the video either. ""Just how active is this fire"", ""the only exceptions are if the drone is right over them, or maybe making noise.""  The model flies directly overhead at rooftop level several times, while easily flying close enough to be a noise distraction, with active fire in plain view, just seconds before being shot at. So...by your own implications, you tell me...  Also, while between the initial fire knockdown and extinguishment the need for lots of personnel in the interior decreases (meticulous accountability for a smaller number of frequently rotated personnel is best) that does not decrease the need for clear communication or unhindered observation as conditions are still hazardous and could rapidly change.  Plus if you have a fire department that can dedicate this number of personnel to a residential fire, be grateful. It is safer for the responders and greatly increases capability especially in a situation like a victim rescue. Lots of departments/communities aren't so lucky and everyone pays the price."

radiocontrol,38j6fg,NASA_propulsion,3,Thu Jun 4 15:58:06 2015 UTC,"I am new to the hobby, but I have never liked the RC controllers on the market.  Flying around with a joystick just seems so much more fun... and it is!  I took a USB computer joystick and hooked it up to an Arduino Mega.  The mega formulates a PPM stream and pushes it to a FrSKY radio transmitter.    I've had a bunch of people (complete newbies!) fly with this setup, and it's very intuitive and fun.  We haven't noticed any lag at all.  The arduino formulates the PPM with an interrupt timer and spends all other time simply querying the joystick pots.  It's fast and there aren't any lags like you would get with folks controlling their quads with joysticks going in through the 3DR telemetry link.  For extra fun, there are 6 arcade push buttons on the top of the electrical box.  These allow me to select a flight mode for the APM on either my quadcopter or airplane.  There are also opt switches for channel 7 and 8.  Here is a video of us flying around a quad with this setup.  Ask questions if you have them!  Here is a more detailed build thread.  Alot of credit goes to a guy named Ian on this thread who wrote most of the code base."

It would not be difficult at all to simply implement this driver sfotware and make a few small changes to the base code to make this work.  Again, this would be a very low lag solution"

radiocontrol,38j6fg,FSMCA,2,Thu Jun 4 19:34:14 2015 UTC,"At the moment, the best way to describe this is an expensive prototype/ hobby project.  As you can see under the hood, it's run by and arduino mega and there is alot of manual soldering and wiring to buttons and the power supply and whatnot.  (Which makes it a fun project!!)  The next step before selling this would be to develop a commercial product with everything on an embedded chip.  Honestly, there probably is a market for this kind of thing.  I only made this build after of hours of searching for an off-the-shelf joystick solution."
radiocontrol,38j6fg,Jens1970,2,Thu Jun 4 19:57:43 2015 UTC,"Just saying, I would put it on ebay/rcgroups classifieds for a price that you would be happy to sell it for and build a version 2 when/if it sells, you might be surprised what some people will pay for something like that even in a DIY/prototype package."

Materials for the current version come out to somewhere around $275 after tax and shipping.  Throw in $125 or so for labor... I would imagine a price tag of around $400 for someone wanting a finished product of this prototype.  Maybe $300 for a DIY package with instructions.
radiocontrol,38j6fg,jjmelo,2,Thu Jun 4 20:13:57 2015 UTC,Could you map the flight modes to buttons on a joystick?  That could make the base unit much smaller (portability) on version 2.  Maybe version 3 could do that and be small enough to clip onto the back of an xbox controller.  I could see people going crazy over this.
radiocontrol,38j6fg,jjmelo,2,Thu Jun 4 20:28:19 2015 UTC,"Actually, yeah, you certainly could!  The driver set that I'm using pulls down everything from the controller --> so you have full knowledge of what buttons are being pressed.  That's not a bad idea.  And yes, if an actual chip were designed with everything on it, it could be made pretty compact - probably to the point where it could be thrown onto the back of an xbox controller.  It would add a bit of weight and bulk out a bit, but probably not too bad.  Yeah, this would actually make a great kickstarter idea"

Take it to a field where the grass is long and give it a gentle toss, beginning just a few feet above the ground.  If it dives into the grass, then the CG is too far forward.  If it tries to gain altitude and stalls, the CG is too far back.  Make corrections with clay, or whatever weighty stuff you have (coins and tape, etc) until you get a nice, flat glide path and no tendency to either dive or stall.  You will need to do this whether or not you have the mfr's recommended CG, as their suggestion is usually too far forward."

The centuries that we spent devising  physics, mathematics, chemistry, engineering, metallurgy - All of our combined knowledge and technological advancements as a species were to finally culminate in the creation of a machine of such flawless beauty that it now clearly stands out as human civilization's crowning achievement:  Airwolf.  In 1984 the world's most brilliant scientists and engineers were assembled in secret for the sole purpose of constructing the world's most advanced  Mach One Plus attack helicopter.  This would be more than just an instrument of war. It would be a work of art.  And no expense was spared in this, mankind's boldest endeavor to date.  The original Da Vinci parchments were consulted. Extrapolations were made. Fifth generation Swiss craftsmen were flown in merely to construct the dashboard.  There was painstaking attention to detail.  And upon its completion,  those present were unable to do anything  but stand and marvel in wonder and in awe  at the sleek, black aerodynamic perfection . . . that was Airwolf.  And I know there are voices of dissent shouting, ""What about Blue Thunder? What about Knight Rider?"" Fuck Blue Thunder. Fuck Michael Knight!  Airwolf.  Airwolf is the adjective we should use to describe anything  of majesty, beauty, and intensity.  Something that is simply fucking bad ass . . . is Airwolf. James Brown's music is Airwolf. Shakespeare is Airwolf. Sex so good it makes your spine ache and your knees buckle. . . That's Airwolf.  And nothing is more Airwolf than Airwolf.  Airwolf is the Holy Grail. The Golden Fleece. The thing you want that you cannot have. When you go sprinting through the Mall desperate to fill the emptiness in your life  through the purchase of name brand clothing and electronics- You will never achieve satisfaction. Because the one brand name you really want is the one you can never have. Airwolf? Oh, I'm sorry, we're all sold out. That item was only available for a very limited time and in very limited supply.  One.  And only one man stepped forward to purchase it. String Fellow Hawk! And he bought it for the bargain basement price of having the solid brass balls to steal it from the US government,  when, in their hubris, they were foolish enough to ask him to be the test pilot!   You don't ask a guy with a name like String Fellow Hawk  to fly your top-secret black helicopter.  Why? Because he is obviously going to steal it! He's obviously a prototypical American anti-hero,  for fuck's sake! He lives in the mountains.  He plays the cello. His name is String Fellow Hawk. He cannot be trusted. He's not going to use Airwolf to execute American foreign policy. He's going to keep it for himself.  Which is exactly what you would do.  Walking out to your back yard to stare at it every night around sunset. The sight of it filling you such peace and resonant satisfaction  that you would come to believe the perfect haiku  would have just two syllables: Airwolf."

radiocontrol,387in9,azureking32123,3,Tue Jun 2 12:18:21 2015 UTC,"The motor and ESC will almost certainly be able to handle the extra voltage, but you can't tell if they can handle the extra current.   For motors you can run it for a bit and see if it gets hot, but ESCs burn out much faster than motors because they don't have the metal parts to act as a heat sink. Normally you would use a watt-meter to measure the current as you throttle up, but with no idea how much the ESC can handle, there's not much point!   If you dangle it from a wing tip and throttle up (carefully), how far up does it swing? Anything over about 45 degrees should fly, but nearer 90 degrees is better. If your friend flew it on 2s it should be OK. Flying wings don't need a lot of thrust, they prefer to fly fast and smooth."

radiocontrol,387in9,full_trucker_effect,2,Tue Jun 2 15:54:27 2015 UTC,/u/Habitat__ is right - build another one! The air frame is the cheapest part! You can either scratch build a cheap air frame or buy an arf/kit. A couple hours and just a few dollars and you'll have a brand new plane.  Here's a ton of simple foamy plans. Also check out the plane kits designed by the guys at Flite Test.  EDIT: words
radiocontrol,387in9,encaseme,2,Tue Jun 2 20:08:11 2015 UTC,"In-general (I see you've already crashed, don't worry, it happens) you'd want to identify the make/model of the ESC, Battery, and Motor, to ensure that they are all compatible:   The battery needs to be able to provide as much current as the motor will draw at maximum (at a minimum it should be able to do this, probably much more, so you get less voltage-sag as the motor attempts to draw more current). This is calculated from the capacity and ""C""-rating of the pack. The ESC needs to be rated for at least as much current as the motor will draw at maximum. The ESC needs to be rated for as much voltage as the battery pack you are using. There exists such a thing as a two-cell-only ESC, if you put three-cells on the input of that sort of ESC you'd fry it. The motor needs to be rated to handle the amount of voltage the battery pack puts out.   That being said there are plenty of models that fly just fine on 2S packs. I have a handful that use 1S packs as well. The larger-series packs can generally put out more power, but don't discount the smaller ones. Planes generally fly well on what they're designed for, once you start upping the pack-size, you're putting more weight into the craft, which can greatly affect the handling characteristics. I, too, once always would ""upgrade"" my batteries (in size, and capacity), but realized my models often fly better as close to ""stock"" as I can get them."
radiocontrol,387in9,dougmc,1 point,Tue Jun 2 23:19:48 2015 UTC,"For future use, buy something like this, if not exactly this -- the price is certainly right.  Then fully charge the battery, put the device inline with the battery, hold the plane down good, and go full throttle and see what it says.  In flight the motor will ""unwind"" a bit more from what it'll do on the ground, so the current draw in air will be a little less, but it'll give you a good idea of the current draw.  Is it more than the ESC and motor are rated for?  Then use a slightly smaller prop and see what you get.  (You can often cut off the tips of the prop to make it smaller/use less current, then sand the tips to make them smooth again, and then make sure you balance it again.  If you're not comfortable with this, just buy a new prop.)  Beyond that, you can use the program ""motocalc"" or use this web page to calculate how much current something should use based on the prop and motor and other stuff, but actually measuring it is good too."

That, or they don't understand CoG and the plane is way tail heavy, or have the controls reversed or something ... but mostly it seems to be the ""the plane is coming towards me, so the controls are reversed!"" thing that does in most of them."

When an analogue servo is torqued away from where it thinks it should be, it applies power to the motor, proportional to how far displaced it is.  When a digital servo detects that it isn't where it should be, it applies full power straight away.  So if you go digital, you'll probably want a slightly bigger BEC. On the upside, digital servos hold their centre-point a lot better, and should respond faster to small changes in their input."

radiocontrol,388osn,NoTifuToday,-2,Tue Jun 2 19:56:48 2015 UTC,"The company's plan is to use many drones to create a 'conveyor' system for deploying many small packages. They are trying to bring aid to areas that can't receive it through traditional means, mostly because militants see large aircraft and other transports as prime targets. When you can disable a vehicle that costs hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars with an RPG that costs $500, it's probably worth it.   But the drone/swarm approach not only makes it more difficult to destroy the vehicles because they are much smaller, but brings their kill value down to the point that it's not worth it to try to destroy them.   I appreciate the skepticism, but with it needs to come some due diligence. I'd encourage you to research their project.

As for an osd, the top of the line at the moment is the EagleTree Vector. It has gps, return to home, and all the other sensors and information you could want displayed in screen. It's also stupidly easy to setup.   As for fpv, there are a few things to think about. How far are you wanting to fly? Do you use UHF or 2.4ghz for control? UHF will give you a lot longer range, I recommend the DTFUHF system. This will determine what fpv frequency you can use. If you use UHF you can use 1.3, 1.2, 2.4ghz bands, but only if you're flying alone, as many people fly on 2.4 for their radios they will drown out your fpv signal. You could fly 5.8ghz too, these are really popular, but you won't get the range. If you want some good long range flying I'd recommend 1.3ghz as your fpv frequency.   A friend of mine has this exact setup, radian pro, UHF, 1.3 video and esgletree vector and absolutely zero problems. He can get a bloody long way away and still get amazing video signal with no dropouts."

Flatter shapes that skip across the water are more efficient in flat water but too bouncy in waves.  I wouldn't advise buying anything with a plan to upgrade immediately, as you'll be throwing away the original power system and the hull might not be strong enough for much more power.  IMHO small models are as much fun as big models, the action looks the same and just takes place further away with a big model. Big models cope with rougher conditions though."

radiocontrol,37q4hi,Huttser17,6,Fri May 29 15:42:53 2015 UTC,Not worth the risk. If the chip is damaged it may give out any time during flight. It's much safer just to replace the ESC.

radiocontrol,37rf8t,dougmc,1 point,Sat May 30 10:03:28 2015 UTC,"Did it come with a battery?    It looks like it's missing a battery that might look something like this -- that's a pretty standard old-school R/C car battery, though your tank might take a battery in a different size/shape.  That said, this looks like the same size/shape.  In case you do have a battery, you plug the charger into the battery for the length of time they prescribe (or stop when it starts getting warm), and then put the battery into the tank and plug the tank's connector into the battery connector.  You should probably unplug the battery when the tank isn't being used -- I don't know if it has a switch or not, but even if not, sometimes they will still drain the battery slowly even with the switch off.  If you do need to buy a battery, this looks like it's about right but of course it's hard to tell without having it front of me.  The exact capacity and type (NiCd vs NiMH) probably doesn't matter, but certainly, don't use LiPo unless your charger is designed for it -- and I doubt it is.  Your local hobby shop probably has appropriate batteries ... but they'll probably want more money for them."
radiocontrol,37rf8t,dougmc,1 point,Fri May 29 20:12:04 2015 UTC,It didn't come with a battery or a manual either.

radiocontrol,37rf8t,Airazz,2,Fri May 29 20:21:28 2015 UTC,"It probably takes a battery of the exact shape and size that I showed -- that's pretty standard.  As for capacity, you'll find them between 1500 and 5000 mAh, paying more for the higher capacities.  They'll all work, but the smaller ones will give you less runtime and will take less time to charge.  There's no need to get exactly 3300 mAh if that's hard to find."

Motors may be similar, but the Kv ratings commonly used are different, and cars generally have a gear on them (though sometimes you can swap the gear or add it to something that didn't have one before.  Also, the mounting options tend to be different.)  Cars don't usually have control boards at all ... just a RX.

But you can still use the receiver and one of the transmitters to fly a plane.  You should google the transmitter name and see what mixers it can provide.  That'll decide what you are able to fly.

They told me that there would be shipping delays from US West but only after complaining several times.  I was about to do a PayPal charge-back (or whatever their equivalent is) but they shipped it right before I was going to.  When they finally shipped it, I noticed on the tracking information that it came from Oregon.  I believe it used to ship from Washington State.

Try to be respectful no matter what. The old guys tend to be reserved at first because they expect young people to be disrespectful. Its an age-based stereotype, but they want to be pleasantly surprised and will bend over backwards to help when they discover you're a good guy.  As for losing planes I'm going to take a guess that you're having orientation problems. It's a universal problem that all RCers have to initially overcome.

They should be, but sometimes people think that's not how things should be -- usually right after there's a crash of some sort and they feel that the other guy caused it and should pay for their plane.  In general, the people with the $10+ K planes don't fly them unless they are the only people flying or they fully trust everybody else who's up in the air with them, but even with a $400 plane there can be plenty of drama if something goes wrong.  Ultimately, it's just part of the hobby ...  At least now most people are on 2.4 GHz stuff.  Back when everybody had distinct channels you had to make sure that only one person was using a channel at a time -- because if two people tried, their planes would probably crash.  It meant taking turns if two people who up at the field on the same channel and neither can change channels, and it also means that if one of them has a problem where they lose control they may be accusing you of turning your radio on and causing it ...

So it would be appropriate for a small park flier or glider.  (I wouldn't use the motor for anything, however.  A small brushless motor and ESC is now cheap and would perform much better.)  There's nothing really wrong with AM -- it worked about as well as FM.  That said, a lot of old AM gear was pre 1991 and so not narrowband and was therefore illegal to use after that ... but this stuff is clearly newer than that.  Assuming that this is 72 MHz gear (US), using it on something that doesn't fly would be illegal -- 75 MHz is for ground, 72 MHz  is for air."

If the image is representative of the model you are planning on building, I would also say, stay away from a v-tail for your first bird.   I would take a look at the testflite swappables. They are a series of good panes ranging from trainers to advanced acrobatics. Also means you don't have to design your own build.  I am making my own plane from scratch cardboard. It's a heavy material when it comes to model aircraft. I am on mobile right now but if you like, I can link to some of the info I found when designing my plane. I went against my own advice here but I have a good head for math, don't know if you do.  I know my plane will fly, because I built it, sans electronics, and threw it into the wind. It climbed, went tail heavy, went higher and stalled. It didn't fall like a rock until after the stall. I just need to adjust the center of gravity now.

radiocontrol,37jw3h,GoLeePro427,1 point,Sat May 30 08:21:34 2015 UTC,"TL;DR: Go for it (as long as you know how to fly already). Stick to high T:W, low wing loading, and look at a lot of similar aircraft.  Others say don't make your first scratch-build complex, I say if you know what you're doing it doesn't matter; my first scratch-build was complex and it worked great. But my first scratch-build wasn't my first plane.  If you haven't flown before, you shouldn't do your first flights on a build of your own design. The principle here is that it can be hard to identify if failures are due to poor piloting or poor engineering. Definitely start on a proven trainer model.   That aside, if you design to match the wing loadings of similar aircraft which are also capable of hand-launch, you should be fine. As is right now, it sounds like your wing loading is maybe 3 times what it should be. For a glider like this, where is all that weight coming from? shouldn't be 13 lbs...  If it were me, I would take one of my hand-launch planes out (bixler should be fine), put some flight data recording stuff on there, and hand-launch it a buncha times. I would find the slowest launch speed that worked and derive a reasonable formula for estimating if an aircraft can be hand-launched. I understand though that most people don't have access to a good pitot-static setup. You'll have to just stick to high T:W and low wing-loading and look at a lot of similar aircraft.  V-tail is not difficult - if you're using XFLR you can verify the stability just the same as any other tail. Typically the longitudinal S&C requirements push the tail dihedral angle closer to 30-35 degrees rather than the 45 deg you have there: something to experiment with at least. Also, you'll have more efficient, stronger, cooler looking tails if you add some taper in there. My recommendation on v-tail is make the tail long (you're already on a good start for that one), and try to make the v-tail free-floating during cruise. What I mean by that is don't put a lot of downforce or lift on it, keep it low-load."

Gliders are incredibly hard to control for a beginner, require racecar-like precision and experience to tune the balance and surfaces. V-tails also add huge obstacles if you're designing your own.  What happens when wind hits this and you lose control and a 13lb, 10 foot wide missile is dropping out of the sky at 100 kmph?

For this application, any typical 90° or 180° servo will work just fine. The servo can even be powered directly through the arduino 5v pin, given it is a small servo. Otherwise you may need a different power source. Regardless, an interface board is not required to talk to servos."

Servos differ from motors in that they have a potentiometer that tells them how much they have moved.  You send them a signal that basically says move to this percentage of your total range of motion.   As long as the servo has power and signal it will try and stay at that point. If there is no forces acting on it then servo no longer has to work, but as soon as a force is applied, like gravity, the servo has to continually work to overcome it."

radiocontrol,37juvj,star_boy2005,3,Fri May 29 05:36:46 2015 UTC,"Most radios have two sticks with two axes per stick. It is not uncommon for the stick that controls the throttle to stay where you leave it in the up/down axis, but the remaining three axes usually auto-center. The controllers themselves are the same, though. The return spring is simply removed from the throttle control. If you open the transmitter you can easily add a replacement spring of the throttle control to make it auto-center as well."

radiocontrol,37ibp4,ChoaticRobot,2,Wed May 27 21:39:18 2015 UTC,"Both of Radios have great community support, and can be flashed with open source firmware. You pay over twice as much for the Taranis, but the advantages are huge:   The Taranis can be flashed via the usb input. The 9X need a little soldering to do the same thing(I heard there is a method to do it without soldering, but I am unsure). Flashed with new firmware allows you to create model mixes with you PC, using OpenTX Companion Software. Also, allows the radio to function as a usb joystick, I use my Taranis with a simulator.  The 9X requires a Transmitter module, the Taranis doesn't need a module, its built in. The radios can only be used with their respective brand of receivers. However, you can add or change the module to use other receivers. Like the OrangeRX module, this will allow you to use any DSM2/DSMX receiver (OrangeRX or LemonRX are some cheapest receivers on the market). With the Taranis and a OrangeRX module you can use FrSky receivers and any DSM2/DSMX receiver without changing any hardware on your radio. Great when flying planes with differing receivers. The Taranis has a backlit LCD The Taranis comes with a battery(I don't think the 9X comes with battery).   I would say wait and save up a little more for the Taranis."

The more pitch, the more forward motion per one revolution of the prop. The bigger diameter prop will have  more bite per revolution (this is thrust, basically you're moving more air).  All things being equal, and I'm just pulling numbers out the air here, but a 10x6 vs 11x5. The 10 will be faster because of pitch, plus it will be a little faster because of size. It will use more battery compared to the 11x5. You might also say that the 11x5 would be more efficient. So prop selection really depends on your goals. Lots of this would depend on the motor and airframe and (wing loading). Ask more questions and I can maybe help a little more"
radiocontrol,37iwca,gyrnik,1 point,Thu May 28 00:05:54 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply, Im finishing up converting an old gas plane my dad build forever ago to electric. My main goal is to get the longest possible flight times. Because its a trainer model I'm not concerned about getting a ton of speed out of it but i dont want to have to be at 3/4 or full throttle just to keep it in the air.  When you say the 10 is faster, is that air speed of the plane or rotational speed of the prop?  That would seem backwards to me (Which it could be) that a smaller prop would make the plane go quicker. Is the difference in one unit of pitch more significant than an extra inch of length?  Thanks again for the reply."
radiocontrol,37iwca,gyrnik,1 point,Thu May 28 01:36:42 2015 UTC,"No, they are both very meaningful. It may be easier to explain with ecalc. I'll have to see if I can run some calcs on it.  The 10 is faster in both ways. The diameter is smaller, which lets the motor spin it faster. Combine that with the lager pitch, and you get a faster plane. (think like a slightly coarser thread on a screw, which would get you a little more forward travel per each revolution of the prop)"

radiocontrol,37f3ca,star_boy2005,3,Thu May 28 18:23:44 2015 UTC,"A few things I enjoyed working on when I got to that stage was flying inverted and holding position in the wind.   The first requires inverting your mental orientation, such that what you've learned to do to turn left is now what you do to turn right. It helps exercise your mind's flexibility in changing orientation. It's also a lot of fun. The Champ requires a little bit more skill to fly inverted because it wants to flip back over. I like to start out in normal flight at a safe altitude and then push over forward like you're going into a dive but keep forward pressure on the elevator until you're upside down. Going this way is a bit easier than pulling up into an inverted posture because you've got more airspeed diving which you'll need because the Champ isn't quite as lifty upside down. Another method is to go into a dive and then pull back on the stick until you're inverted. You get the added speed but you don't have to be as high.  Holding your position in the wind helps you master fine stick control. You'll be in a little more wind, which is challenging itself, and you'll be adjusting throttle as well as rudder and elevator to keep your position. It's real obvious when you change position so you have to be quick on the stick to compensate for gusts.   Both are a lot of fun and I still like to practice them in my Champ when I get a chance."
radiocontrol,37f3ca,UsernameOmitted,2,Wed May 27 16:09:00 2015 UTC,Thanks for the reply. Definitely some things to try out. I hadn't considered practicing holding position in the wind!
radiocontrol,37f3ca,Jojosu,2,Thu May 28 18:25:08 2015 UTC,"The Champ, being high-winged with a dihedral wing shape, will tend to self right itself, and the lack of ailerons make flight inverted or knife edges difficult.  This is great though in a beginner plane because you want it stable and consistent until you've got the controls down pat.   Figure eights in both directions work well for practising orientation skills.  Try to aim for being able to consistently just know what direction to go when the plane is facing any direction.   Another poster mentioned touch and go landings. This is great. You definitely want to have landing skills perfected when you get a fast and expensive plane.   Near stall flight is another area I like to practice. Planes that are going too slow will start to stall and it can cause crashes, or loss of control especially during landing.  When I started getting into 3D flight, I learned how to Harrier and I surprisingly learned a lot about being able to look at my plane and notice when a stall was coming and how to control the plane in that near stall state. I am not too familiar with the motor power available to The Champ, but look up videos of planes performing the 3D move called a Harrier.  When you do get a new plane with ailerons, knife edge flight and knife edge figure eights would be a good next step to practice.   Best of luck!"

radiocontrol,379dt8,Clock_Man,5,Mon May 25 23:05:25 2015 UTC,"I practiced on a sim for several hours, but still had a couple of crashes before I was comfortable.  When you say ""nosedive"", are you saying that you are crashing in the same way every time?  Or just crashing in general?  If you're really just pitching forward into the ground every time you might want to check that your CG isn't too far forward and/or that you have reasonable throws set up...  The Nutball was my second plane; they can be a bit twitchy and flying in any real amount of wind will make things harder for you.  If you're still struggling you might try a somewhat easier-to-fly model."
radiocontrol,379dt8,alfpope,6,Mon May 25 23:20:24 2015 UTC,"I will second this suggestion. When you ease off the sticks, your plane should fly pretty straight. If you need to be holding a direction to keep the plane flying straight, something is wrong. It especially concerns me that you have had multiple crashes from the same issue, that is not normal.    If you have the 24"" Nutball, put a ruler where the leading edge of the wing meets the fuselage and measure 6"" back. Pinch the plane at that point and it should just balance there. If it leans forward or back, move stuff like the battery around until you have it balanced.   Best of luck!"

radiocontrol,379dt8,Youdontreddit,2,Tue May 26 04:11:20 2015 UTC,"Every time I crashed it was straight into the ground, I had a hunch that the cg was slightly too far forward. I was able to keep it in the air, but if I caught an aggressive bank to the left I found it hard to recover and pull out of it. I might have been slightly out of trim. I was flying 30% expos and 50% rates to keep things under control.  What was your first plane? I've built the three ""starter"" swappables from FT, and I'm flying the nutball because they said it was the easiest to learn on. Would you disagree? Would the flyer be a better choice?"
radiocontrol,379dt8,xrstunt,2,Tue May 26 01:28:52 2015 UTC,"You want your gear to be setup very good from the start.  Don't be hobbled by improperly setup things, it will make learning 10x easier when your plane is correct.  Set your plane up mechanically first, then use your radio to fine tune.  Get your CG right, do a preflight, and use a sim if you're still crashing.  If you're constantly having trouble after a few weeks, it's time to slow down and (IMO) get help from someone more experienced."
radiocontrol,379dt8,alfpope,1 point,Tue May 26 20:03:09 2015 UTC,"You probably noticed that the rudder has to be trimmed to one side to keep the Nutball from banking due to prop torque.  This trim will also cause it to lose altitude fast when you bank in the same direction.  So that at least is expected.  If I'm turning that way I just try to keep it gentle.  My first was a ""Simple Wing"" depron plane I found on rcgroups.  It flew surprisingly well, but being a wing it's fairly pitch sensitive and I crashed it a few times before I got the hang of it.  I do think FT recommends you go with the Flyer first, but I have no personal experience with it."

radiocontrol,379dt8,OldGuyzRewl,3,Tue May 26 12:14:14 2015 UTC,"In order to fly, you must first learn how to land.  A flight simulator can be very helpful here, and will save you lots of time and $$$.  Once you can land the simulator 100% of the time, you can try a micro sized model, preferably outside on grass.  A tiny light model like this will be much more durable than a larger, heavier one.  When you can ""land"" the micro plane, step up to a larger model.  It takes about 1000 landing attempts to gain the skill."

radiocontrol,379dt8,monkey_man_,1 point,Thu May 28 06:06:29 2015 UTC,"Well so the first thing that helped me was that I wasn't so nervous when flying after training on the simulator.  Before the simulator, when I would set my brand new $250 plane on the ground and do a pre-flight check, my hands would literally start to tremble lol.  It's was so nerve racking for me.  The simulator helps you get a feel for how a real RC plane flies and the sensitivity of the controls.  I mean, the physics are dead-on.  Also as a new RC pilot, it's very easy to lose orientation while in-flight.  When you want to turn or roll, it's easy when the plane is flying away from you, but when the plane is flying towards you, you have to flip everything in your brain.  This was such a hard thing to overcome without the simulator.   And when you wreck in the sim, no big deal. Press the reset/rewind button and try again.  It makes you feel soo much more incredibly confident when you are flying in real life, and you KNOW that everything is going to be okay."

I went to the local hobby shop (Hobbytown USA, the same place I purchased the car) and asked for a replacement ESC.  They sold me this ESC.  I had to pack up before I could replace it.  A few months of procrastination later in NY, I took it out of the closet and I noticed that it was different from the ESC that was in the car before.  I plugged it in anyway, but then the car was hardly moving, and when it did, it moved in reverse, and didn't have enough power to move the wheels unless I picked it up.  So I put the old ESC back in and now it doesn't respond to throttle and all, but responds to steering just fine.  I haven't checked the batteries in the Tx, but I'm pretty sure that's not the cause.  I'm led to believe that it's a receiver problem at this point, but on the other hand the steering works fine.  I'll be taking it into the hobby shop as soon as I can.  Any information is greatly appreciated.  Thanks!"

As u/mahamoti said, probably a 12V (usually 1-2A) The manual (which you can probably find online) should specify the volt and amp rating of what you need. Just make sure you get the voltage right.

radiocontrol,375tml,pX_,3,Mon May 25 22:36:36 2015 UTC,What do you mean remove the dihedral? Isnt that what self-corrects the plane? I think it'll be okay with a 3ch airplane. I'm just 2 months into the hobby so please correct me if i'm wrong
radiocontrol,375tml,pX_,3,Mon May 25 05:58:21 2015 UTC,"In the case of a free flight glider, it's there to correct for the fact that the plane has no one controlling it.  If you add ailerons, you'll probably want to remove most of the dihedral (I would still leave 3-5 degrees)."
radiocontrol,375tml,nicolaib211v,1 point,Mon May 25 07:39:07 2015 UTC,"I'm going to have to do more research on the matter. I've built 3 planes with polyhedral and dihedral which all handled beautifully. If the plane acts super funky, i'll dial the dihedral down, but I feel it wont be necessary."
radiocontrol,375tml,galorin,3,Mon May 25 08:07:03 2015 UTC,"It's not like it won't work with lots of dihedral, but a plane with ailerons is going to be a lot more fun to fly without too much of it.  All of my slope gliders have some amount of dihedral (or poly), for example, but not nearly as much as a glider with just rudder and elevator controls would.  Also keep in mind that swept back wings provide a dihedral effect, so even if you took all the dihedral out, you'd still have some stability effect because of the wing speep."
radiocontrol,375tml,Huttser17,3,Mon May 25 08:49:17 2015 UTC,This shouldn't apply to this build then correct? I'm building a 3ch as I prefer slow flyers. Just for aesthetics I have the urge to sweep the wings back forward but I havent made up my mind yet. I might use sweeping them forward as a last result for adding weight to the nose
radiocontrol,375tml,kwaaaaaaaaa,1 point,Mon May 25 09:38:54 2015 UTC,"If you mean it's only going to have rudder, and no ailerons, then yes, you'll need the dihedral.  I'd suggest doing a test before you put too much effort into it.  Hinge the rudder and tape in place with a small angle. Then give the plane a free flight toss over some tall grass and make sure it turns properly.  If it doesn't turn, you might actually need more dihedral."

I used a hotwire cutter to chop off the fuse behind the wing and shorten the wings. Then sand down or cut out the wing dihedral and some sweep. Mount as a pusher with elevons and you got a jet. I glued some leftover bits to the front as canards too.   Did the other as a pusher jet with tailerons. Didn't modify the fuselage at all. Same wing procedure as before but no elevons. I've had a thought to mix the ailerons with the tailerons just to see how insane the roll rate could get.   Just don't mount the motor on a pylon, the thrust line is bad.   Otherwise converting these is a nice break from FT planes and still very cheap."

They'll work, sure, but I doubt they'll be able to produce anything like their rated power without overheating. The temperature may have damaged the magnets (quite sensitive to heat, the ones used in these BLDC motors, some start to irreversibly lose magnetism at as low as 80C temps I think), so you'd need to compensate with less aggressive higher-kV props, maybe, as one of the side effects of the weakened magnetic field would be an increase in the kV rating of the motor (as well as reduced power handling).  I don't know, I'm going from hazy memory here. Worth a try I suppose, I guess you could fly very cautiously for a bit and regularly check if they were burning up."

radiocontrol,375nxt,nolebotic,2,Mon May 25 03:28:15 2015 UTC,"You could use the existing powerpod mount, but nose mounting would be more aerodynamically cleaner with a folding prop that feathers/folds against the fuselage when the motor is off and the plane is gliding."

I didn't really know much about RC planes, and no Internet to help.  I remember using parts from RC cars to get it going. Figured a 2 channel radio works like any other! Took it to a local park to try, had the elevator backwards and over compensated as it dived. Ended up landing tail first, that was that.  I did then mount the wings to the chassis of a Kyosho touring car I had, that worked slightly, got it about a foot of the ground a couple of times! Then naturally it had no stability so one time it went sideways and crushed the wing.  Around that time I was building a balsa trainer that used a glow engine, I'd got it ready for covering and my sister stood on it, fuselage and wings. Bah.   Thankfully, I'm an adult now and have access to huge amounts of rc shops! That younger me would have been in awe at what I have now.   Thanks for reminding me, I might have to get a kit and try make one."

But here's the thing- you dont need the plans to rebuild it. You can simply take the existing dimensions and study the existing structure carefully and rebuild it that way. I would also recommend that you rebuild the new fuse with the intent of installing a brushless electric motor in the nose. That old 1/2a wet fuel engine is going to be underpowered, loud and messy.

radiocontrol,375lfv,spikes232v2,3,Mon May 25 02:03:56 2015 UTC,Horizon hobby has some pretty excellent customer service.   The servo issue and quite possibly the esc issue were probably both caused by a bad reciever.   Call them and ask them to send you a new reciever. Ask for SR200WP 2-Ch DSM Sport Receiver Waterproof  SPMSR200WP  if you can get them too.   You can then bind your good car radio to it.   I'd ask for a new servo as well.   The stuff rattling around while it may be frustrating seems mostly cosmetic to me.

What kind of control system are you using on the droid?  Do you just need direct control of each axis?  If so any regular RC Tx/Rx system would work.  And what do you mean by USB transmitter?  Something that can be programmed vi USB or that connects to a PC as an HID?
radiocontrol,36y187,KillerSpud,1 point,Sat May 23 15:18:38 2015 UTC,I was thinking of trying to plug a rc transmitter into the usb port of the Nvidia shield.  that an app can use to send signals o a motor controller.
radiocontrol,36y187,KillerSpud,1 point,Sat May 23 15:32:54 2015 UTC,"That seems like a lot of extra work when there are many more direct options the require no extra programming at all.  Most motor controllers can accept an RC servo signal directly from a hobby Rx, so that would eliminate the Shield, the app for the shield, the WiFi device in the droid, and whatever interface you need from the WiFi to the motor controller.  K.I.S.S.  Personally I would recommend a Turnigy 9x from Hobbyking.com, they are inexpensive, and if you aren't afraid of a little soldering can be programmed with open source firmware that rivals $300 radios (I use one called ER9X)."
radiocontrol,36y187,KillerSpud,1 point,Sat May 23 15:39:00 2015 UTC,"I need to be able to control lights, sounds, servos that open/close panels, dome rotation, and of course drive.  I figured that I could use the Shield's touch screen to control all the light, servos, and sound, and use the gamepad to drive and rotate the dome.  I would like to avoid multiple controllers which is why I was looking at the Shield."
radiocontrol,36y187,remotaholic,2,Sat May 23 23:22:02 2015 UTC,"There is a type of serial protocol that some higher end servo systems use called SBUS.

Those radios are going to be on the more expensive side though."

The really cool thing is that it dives and surfaces much like a real sub - by changing its buoyancy. It has a little jack screw driven diaphragm that you adjust up or down with buttons on the remote. There's an astonishingly small prop for forward/aft motion, and a tiny two direction thruster on the stern to turn left/right, giving it the ability to turn without otherwise moving. It's been enough to get my sub fix :)"

If you just soldered the shield wire and it didn't melt through and contact the signal wire then you might be OK. If you did then you probably need to try again or replace the entire dipole antenna. A better solution is to ditch the receivers that come with the 9X and go FrSky.

radiocontrol,36vn1a,nicksuperb,1 point,Fri May 22 15:27:11 2015 UTC,I don't exactly understand the question. Are you looking for add-on transmitter modules? Do you mean transmitters vs. receivers?
radiocontrol,36vn1a,star_boy2005,1 point,Fri May 22 18:47:37 2015 UTC,"Two of the main brands in the RC space are Spektrum and Futaba. Most of the electronic components (transmitters, receivers, servos, ESCs) are compatible with one brand or the other. You'll want to stay within the same system.   There's also the question of frequency class. Receivers and transmitters can be either FM (e.g., 27 MHz, 35 MHz, 49 MHz, and 72 MHz) or they can be some form of digital spread spectrum such as DSM/DSM2/DSMX (which operates at 2.4GHz).   ""Modules"" usually refers to receivers. So, if you're starting with a particular receiver and don't know what it's compatible with, Google its model #/name and see what comes up. The two questions you'll want to answer are: 1) what frequency class is it (FM vs 2.4GHz) and 2) what system is it compatible with (Spectrum vs Futaba). Once you know those two things you can narrow down the range of compatible components.  Note: The brand may be some off brand like OrangeRX but they'll usually be compatible with one system or the other."
radiocontrol,36vn1a,star_boy2005,1 point,Sat May 23 02:57:21 2015 UTC,What brands are best bang for buck? modules that is. That will shape my transmitter choice.
radiocontrol,36vn1a,star_boy2005,1 point,Sat May 23 03:37:28 2015 UTC,"Both have their fans. I'm on the Spektrum system because there are a greater variety of inexpensive models and components available, but they're both good systems. For instance, OrangeRX is a cheap, decent line of small receivers available on Hobbyking. They're available for both Spektrum and Futaba, but I think they have more options for Spektrum.  As for the actual model, you'll want to buy based on your needs, i.e., range, features.   What kind of model are you looking into?"

radiocontrol,36u5pu,fullnorcal,2,Fri May 22 03:58:56 2015 UTC,centimeters. 45.5cm wing span.
radiocontrol,36u5pu,fullnorcal,2,Fri May 22 04:05:12 2015 UTC,"Add winglets.  Add reflex (basically, the elevons should have some up throw added to them in the resting position). instead of packing tape, use really thin (1.3 or 1.7 mil) laminate, the packing tape will add a lot of weight. If you're gonna do an airfoil, and plan to mostly fly non-inverted, a flatbottom or maybe semi-symmetrical airfoil is probably gonna work best for you.   Honestly, i'd personally go for something a little bigger like the mini popwing or crash test hobbies Scythe or the sweepwings runt (actually, i'm not sure if rub has released this one yet). Wings are definitely something that takes a good deal of knowledge to design/build right."

radiocontrol,36u5pu,whidzee,2,Fri May 22 12:06:32 2015 UTC,You need your plane to balance on the cg. Move your components around until that happens. For a flying wing it needs to be spot on. For a tiny flying wing it's even more critical. A balance point too far forwards will make it feel like you're trying to control a whale. A balance point behind the cg will fly once. It will be uncontrollable in the air and you will crash.
radiocontrol,36u5pu,Clustertruck,1 point,Fri May 22 12:13:20 2015 UTC,I'm fine with that level of attention to detail. :-) I could also just add motors until it's balanced (I have 4 brushless 2300kv motors not being used right now)  is the cg the same as the balance point? I've found that the balance point is different from what the calculator said
radiocontrol,36u5pu,Clustertruck,2,Fri May 22 12:25:15 2015 UTC,"You need to get the plane to balance on the cg mark the calculator gives you. Move your battery and other components around until you achieve this. Add extra weight at the extremes if need be, but it's very important"

radiocontrol,36pvai,RC_OUTLAWZ,3,Thu May 21 16:26:20 2015 UTC,"My experience was unfortunately reversed. I got a $40 Radio Shack ""Twin Turbo"" RC plane that was quite ingenious. It used throttle for pitch (faster, it climbs, slower, it dives) and yaw was effected by slowing one of the turbines (tank style). This was automated somewhere since the controls were standard up/down stick and left/right stick, not two throttle sticks like a tank.  Anyway, I had developed muscle memory flying that around, and then a friend of mine got a couple of bona-fide RC planes. While I knew perfectly well how to fly a proper airplane with ailerons, rudder, and elevator, that damned muscle memory had me increasing the throttle whenever the plane would dip toward the ground. Which, of course, only made it get to the ground quicker.  (As an aside, it was funny that he kept smashing his plane into the ground too because he didn't know the first thing about flying. He thought ""up"" on the left stick would make the plane go ""up"" because he was used to always reversing that control on console games. He also thought you only turned by banking and using the elevator. I had to teach him how to fly properly, while not being able to adequately demonstrate it myself due to that damned muscle memory. :-P)"

radiocontrol,36pt4h,Superkatzo,2,Thu May 21 14:15:12 2015 UTC,"Some RC planes are harder than others to fly. That's why you need to select a first plane that is of a type called a ""Trainer"". This trainer plane is easier to fly and learn on. But before plunking down your money, it's important to get a little more knowledge.  Learning  RC is fun but it will be more fun if you do a bit of learning about it first. Most people that just buy a plane and run to the park and throw it in the air, don't have a very good experience. Reddit can be a good place to learn but I also suggest a forum called RC Groups. It's the world's largest RC forum and most of what I know about RC I learned there. On RC Groups there is a Beginners Forum. Go there and read the stickies at the top. There is a ton of good info that will save you time and money.   Select a Trainer Plane  I would suggest the Horizon Delta Ray which should be available at your local hobby shop but there are many good trainers. I know a couple of people that learned by themselves on it. I like it because it's a little smaller than the commonly recommended Apprentice. More importantly you can remove the landing gear and hand launch it then glide in with the power off and belly land on grass. When belly landing on grass you don't need to line up with a runway. Launching and landing are the two hardest parts and that really simplifies things when you're getting started. The Delta Ray also has the SAFE assist technology for when you're in the air. Then once you've done a couple dozen flights like that, add the landing gear.  The Delta Ray also has a version that comes with a transmitter which will actually be useful with other planes (some low-end planes come with a poor transmitter). If you have the money, get an RC flight simulator. I trained with a sim for a few hours before my first flight and it really helped.  Your First Flight   There are many local RC clubs that have people who will teach you to fly, usually for free. See if there is a club near you. If so you can skip the following steps. Go somewhere like the middle of an empty football field with absolutely no trees or obstacles nearby. I know it sounds paranoid but it's worth driving an hour if necessary to such a place for your first flights. Make sure there's very little or no wind. If you can find an experienced RC pilot to go with you on your first flight it can be very helpful, but not everyone has that option. There are sub-forums on RC Groups specifically for most larger cities. If there's a forum for you city you can post there and usually connect up with someone who'll help you with your first flight. That's what I did."

The signal voltage running from the receiver to the esc is in milivolts, so any additional resistance can cause a loss of signal. You may also have to program your esc/receiver to the motor, or in lamens terms you have to tell the receiver the motors full forward, full reverse and neutral positions. Also have you hooked the motor up to an independent power source to verify that the shaft even turns. I dont know if any of this helps, ive only ever used castle motors and ESCs so i dont know much about venom/atomik, but hopefully this points you to some answers"
radiocontrol,36mwi3,twin_cam,4,Wed May 20 18:13:53 2015 UTC,"Well the first point is pure bullshit, the signal is at least 3.3V, and the repair job must be seriously bodged for it not to work.

They do have an RTF version that comes with a transmitter but if you plan on expanding I recommend you get a better transmitter that will expand/grow with your hobby. They can be bought fairly inexpensively. I hear FrSky is a VERY good brand that is quite inexpensive. I use Hobbyking for additional batteries as I've never had an issue and they are pretty cheap. Shipping can take a few weeks but if you know that up front then no worries.
radiocontrol,36ncv7,tryllast,1 point,Wed May 20 17:39:37 2015 UTC,"Best thing you can do is find yourself a RTF (ready to fly) package from a factory manufacturer that you feel comfortable flying - I would suggest an above-wing mounted motor, like the AXN Floater Jet (http://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/__8359__AXN_Floater_Jet_Glider_EPO_1127mm_PNF_.html) or something similar .. check HobbyKing or your local hardware store for some similar plane, as there are a lot to choose from (I have a Floater Jet, its awesome..)  The reason is that as a beginner you're going to have your ups and downs, and the downs are the hard part - so you want to have a plane that will be resilient and tough for while you are learning. A wing-mounted motor will protect your prop, and generally these are tougher planes.  You should also get a few spare batteries - no fun going flying and running out of batteries, especially when you're learning - as well as a decent charging station.  HobbyKing can help you with all of these issues - just choose your plane first, learn what battery it comes with (RTF packages come with everything - transmitter, plane, receiver, battery - but rarely with a charger) and then get a few extra in your order, and then find a valid charger - HobbyKing has a great section on this that you can learn from.  Good luck and happy flying!"

radiocontrol,36j00b,monabender,3,Fri May 22 04:27:59 2015 UTC,"It really cool but it looks like it uses pitch change, in my experience the controls are never robust enough to survive blade strikes."
radiocontrol,36j00b,Potatoe_away,1 point,Tue May 19 22:24:13 2015 UTC,They mentioned something about having a brake prior to landing. Shouldn't the control surfaces be independent of the rotational inertia of the blade? Even if the blade came to a complete stop how would that affect the pitch change?  They also mentioned something about a braking the props prior to landing. I wonder how they will do that.
radiocontrol,36j00b,monabender,1 point,Fri May 22 03:55:37 2015 UTC,"RC aircraft run into things occasionally so I'm not just talking about landings.  The blade is the control surface so how could anything attached to it be independent of its inertia. When I was learning RC helicopters I crashed them a lot, the forces from the blade contacting things would feed back through the linkages and screw everything up. Bent or broken p/c links, broken swash plates and stripped servos were a common occurrence. Not to mention the slop that starts to develop with wear.   Edit: as for the braking, you just use the motor as the ""brake"". Instead of coasting when you reduce throttle it slows to a set rpm,and with throttle at zero the speed controller doesn't allow free wheeling;  gliders use it and it can be turned on in most speed controllers."
radiocontrol,36j00b,Potatoe_away,1 point,Fri May 22 06:39:08 2015 UTC,"You are correct, it is not independent of the inertia of the blade however the swash plate separates the largest force in the blade.  You have the x axis force, which is the blades rotational force, and the y axis force, which is the control surface.    The x axis force should have very minimal impact on the control surface as the swash plate basically separates the two entities.  However the y axis force can have a huge impact on the control surface.  The y axis is impacted any time the blades pitch changes.  In a fixed blade scenario as soon as the helicopter comes down on some obstacle you would have a change in y force.  However since these are folding props the prop should exert most of the change in force to the prop folding upwards or downwards."
radiocontrol,36j00b,monabender,0,Fri May 22 13:22:25 2015 UTC,"In my experience when blades contact a fixed object the contact tends to force the blade to maximum pitch therefore transferring most of the rotational energy through the controls, this very rapid transfer of energy will probably do damage before any blade folding can even begin to occur.  Also, folding upwards is a bad, and shouldn't be allowed at all in the design, so if it happens in a crash sequence, it will force the controls in a direction they shouldn't be designed to go."
radiocontrol,36j00b,Potatoe_away,1 point,Fri May 22 14:08:56 2015 UTC,"Ya, never thought about the folding upwards completely.  If the blade was able to fold upwards how would any force be generated downwards! duh! lol.  Thank you for lending your ear!"

radiocontrol,36l1hl,Desolationism,30,Wed May 20 04:14:26 2015 UTC,"The speed of light in the copper slows down, so antennas have to be around 5% shorter than they should be. Also, antennas usually are much shorter than the wavelength, with dipoles at half a wavelength and monopoles at a quarter wavelength. That is only if you want them resonant, which still won't give you a nice impedance match to that coax. So by shortening it further, they could be bringing the impedance up to provide a better match.  A more likely cause is that the antenna coax has been crushed or damaged, or the connection to the circuit is poor. Or the transmitter is at fault, withe either low power or a faulty antenna there.  Tldr, antennas are black magic."

radiocontrol,36l1hl,star_boy2005,1 point,Wed May 20 18:46:19 2015 UTC,"Carbon fiber is a half decent conductor. If you surround your antenna with it, the signal will be greatly attenuated. Though if you had the antenna away from it, it might have been doing something really weird like acting as a dipole oscillator and amplifying the noise from your brushless motor, overloading your receiver. Though once again, that's a long shot. If that was the case though, cutting it shorter might have improved things."

radiocontrol,36l1hl,addrian27,1 point,Wed May 20 21:09:24 2015 UTC,"I phrased that really poorly. The velocity of the wave is determined by the permittivity of the material around it (permittivity is how easy it is to make the voltage field in a given material). What with insulation and wood around your Rc antenna, as well as the air around it to a small degree, the velocity of the wave will drop.  As a side note, the best way to think about it is not as light while it is still in the antenna, but as an oscillation.

That oscillating magnetic and electric field is the electromagnetic wave, or light."

radiocontrol,36gfyz,HNDMM,2,Tue May 19 04:54:06 2015 UTC,"R/C airplanes can be made for so cheap that I would be tempted to skip the simulator.  You can build a Flight Test Versa wing out of dollar store foam board in an evening or two.  Probably steal some equipment off an unused multirotor, or just some spare parts.  I basically built mine for free, the only thing I had to pickup were some servos and control rods.  Now, I'm a commercial pilot so that's probably cheating a little bit however if you know the basics of how an airplane flies and can handle the relentless forward progress (no hover) then the transition shouldn't be too hard.  The hardest part for airplanes without landing gear is hand launching them.  That's a skill that you can't learn in the simulator.  The biggest problem is that light RC airplanes can not handle much wind, especially gusts.  I now have a Popwing carrying an APM and the stability/fly-by-wire makes a big difference."
radiocontrol,36gfyz,notamedclosed,1 point,Tue May 19 05:13:39 2015 UTC,"I can takeoff and land in all the videogames I have played from my first flight sims in the early 90s, like Jet Fighter and Chuck Yeager's Air Combat, to modern Microsoft Flight Sim.  I consider myself a competent pilot in those, but terrible at dogfighting vs other players online.  However I doubt my dogfighting skills will ever come into play when simply wanting bring back a plane that has had an error during autonomous flight, but who knows.  Of course those are all ""FPV"", so the thought of LOS flight worries me.  I am sure I will obliterate my scratch build with in the first flight unless I put on goggles.  That is why I am considering either a flight sim or something with training wheels.  I have a few APMs that have no other purpose right now than gather dust.  Is there a cheap foam board build you would recommend that could carry one?  I have a few spare DJI red 2212 920kv motors that I could use, and some 3s 2200/3300mAh packs, I assume 4s 5000mAh is too large for a starter plane.  Either way smaller motors/esc/batteries are so cheap, I don't mind spending some cash to get started.  Any suggestions?"
radiocontrol,36gfyz,notamedclosed,2,Wed May 20 03:10:41 2015 UTC,"Airplanes are a little different for FPV...Mainly because it's tough to hand launch them with the goggles on.  I wear glasses so it's doubly hard.  I tend to launch my plane LOS, then after I have it up and stable (this is where the APM sure helps) pop the goggles on and go from there.  I know you are targeting the longer distance flights, but for me flying airplanes LOS has been surprisingly enjoyable.  I never would have thought that before I started trying but it's so simple compared to my big hex.  Just me, the plane and my transmitter.  No goggles, no telemetry tablet, no pile of extra batteries.  Anyway, look up the Versa Wing by Flight Test.  They have build videos, and you can even purchase their speed build kit for cheap, but if you go that route I would actually point you to a tuffwing/popwing/tek sumo as they aren't much more and EPP foam is practically indestructible."
radiocontrol,36gfyz,nicksuperb,2,Wed May 20 19:34:10 2015 UTC,"Definitely do a foam board scratch build. You can do it for such little money and you'll probably be able to use the majority of the spare parts from your multirotor stuff. You can fix it easily with tape and glue. I think its important to have fun while you learn, rather than suffer the anxiety of damaging $100's in goods. Flitetest is the way to go. Some people may glower at such a thing but many of the designs out there are extremely resilient and very customizable. I've built a few FT Versa wings myself."

I can spare one.  I do worry about flying LOS with planes and no stabilization.  I have played enough flight sims, that I think with a properly built and tuned FPV goggle setup that I would be fine, but I fear with LOS I would lose how far I am tilted or something and crash with in the first flight.  So thats why I am thinking something with stabilization and ""training wheels"" would be much better, so I can learn to fly and slowly get used to shedding the assistance.  Could that versa wing carry an APM?"
radiocontrol,36gfyz,MaxeMouse,2,Wed May 20 03:13:55 2015 UTC,"Your 2212 should be just fine for a fixed wing build.  Stabilization is absolutely not necessary for a fixed wing plane. Especially one that's not particularly tiny (like in the Ultra Micro category). You do not need it at all and I wouldn't recommend it. Just practice, you'll get the hang of orienting nose-in/out from a distance in no time. In fact you can practice this with your multirotor LOS.  A versa wing with the blunt nose option can very easily carry an APM board with all the extras.  The most valuable bit of advice I can give you is, find a good large open area to fly and.. expect to crash, you can't learn very much without making a few mistakes."

radiocontrol,369mdm,jjmelo,2,Sun May 17 21:11:52 2015 UTC,"Forgive my ignorance, but without thrust vectoring or air speed, how does one hover a turbine jet?"
radiocontrol,369mdm,Jmersh,3,Sun May 17 19:49:21 2015 UTC,"Watch the video, it is not a true ""hover"" like you would see from a 3D ship.  They still maintain some forward airspeed to give the control surfaces some authority."
radiocontrol,369mdm,link_dead,3,Sun May 17 20:06:41 2015 UTC,"They use the term ""high alpha"" on the flite test videos on youtube."
radiocontrol,369mdm,Eric5989,1 point,Sun May 17 22:36:08 2015 UTC,here is a F/A-18F doing it for real.  https://youtu.be/Fmg-PTf507A?t=538
radiocontrol,369mdm,HeyItsTman,1 point,Mon May 18 03:36:34 2015 UTC,They are using a thrust vectoring system which gives them yaw and pitch control. Their roll control is still dependent on airflow over the control surfaces which is why they never come to a full stop and why the wings rock quite a bit.
radiocontrol,369mdm,TollBoothW1lly,1 point,Mon May 18 17:03:39 2015 UTC,You can't. Combination of the thrust vectoring nozzle and the Powerbox iGyro is what achieves it. No airflow over the control surfaces. It's like balance a broom handle on your hand. The iGyro reacts quicker than any human could.
radiocontrol,369mdm,airplaneshooter,1 point,Mon May 18 20:57:17 2015 UTC,Wow.
radiocontrol,369mdm,Eric5989,1 point,Sun May 17 19:33:38 2015 UTC,Are they using gyros?
radiocontrol,369mdm,charmandeross7,1 point,Sun May 17 19:35:45 2015 UTC,"I am almost certain that they are not using gyros. A stock gyro might be able to help hold the plane in one or two axis of rotation. However, if modified or tuned well, the plane would not wobble like it does, it would be able to lock into an orientation.  I have seen this done with propeller planes, but never with a turbine irl. This is very hard because they have little to no airflow over their control surfaces while stationary in the air. Those hovers would require thrust vectoring in at least one axis, maybe two. It could be done with fins in the back of the turbine, making it almost hidden. Also some nerves and probably years of holding that transmitter would help pull that off."
radiocontrol,369mdm,Eric5989,2,Sun May 17 20:10:46 2015 UTC,"Thats kind of what i was thinking. Ive seen it done with a big ducted fan jet, it looked similar, but nowhere near that low. He was talking about maybe adding gyros, its still amazing either way"
radiocontrol,369mdm,dougmc,2,Sun May 17 22:32:38 2015 UTC,"I have a ducted fan jet with thrust vectoring in two axis, in addition to the normal control surfaces.  The vectoring is very simple to do, it's just two servos that move the ""skirt"" after the fan around.  That said, I don't have the skills to hover anything, let alone a jet, but it's kind of a novel concept.  I have those channels mixed to the rudder and elevator channels so they help out a little bit, but really ... they don't make much of a difference for me, they're just more of a novelty.  But maybe somebody with the right skills could do something more impressive with them, like make the plane hover.  (That said, I don't think mine has enough thrust to hover.)"
radiocontrol,369mdm,charmandeross7,1 point,Sun May 17 23:20:45 2015 UTC,"Yeah edfs are notoriously bad at the whole static thrust thing. Ill bet the mixing and vectoring setup you have is similar to what these guys are working with. They, however, have thrust a plenty."

radiocontrol,36bom2,nicolaib211v,1 point,Mon May 18 14:33:20 2015 UTC,"Well, it will either be an ATV, Helicopter, or Airplane. Or maybe even a drone. I'm shooting for the one I can take advantage of the most inside my budget, really.  As for the range of the signal, one mile would be ideal. However, I'm willing to cut back on it for my budget. Although if I'm not mistaken, the comment above with the product has a 1 mile range for under 30$ (which doesn't seem so bad)."
radiocontrol,36bom2,Coastreddit,1 point,Mon May 18 20:24:39 2015 UTC,"Well what's the mission? is there one? or just building something to have fun?   Aircraft are far harder to fly than an ATV would be to drive, but your range for FPV would be much higher due to less ground interference.   The 1 mile range is in ideal conditions with the world praying for you. i'd be pretty surprised if you get a couple football fields away and still have a usable signal. That being said, it's pretty unheard of for that kind of system for that little. Remember, you still need an RX, and a way to see the feed (e.g. a monitor or goggles).   I've never built one, but I'd venture to say your cheapest option would be a car of some kind."

The setup they had was 2x 3 cell batteries wired in series for higher voltage for higher speed. The banana plugs on the batteries are a bad idea, and you can make a series harness with some more foolproof connectors. Personally I would not double the components, but I would make provisions for using larger capacity batteries."

That means you will have 2 batteries to mess with rather than 4, one per motor/esc/axl.  Also, you can get higher MHA ones and that will mean longer run times.  I would recommend a charger like this http://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/__76462__IMAX_B6_AC_DC_Charger_5A_50W_With_US_Plug_Copy_.html at least but I personally would use a higher wattage one because it will charge the batteries faster, however most of those will be DC only and you will need an AC to DC converter...

I have nothing against anyone in this thread, I just strongly disagree with the notion.   It's basically been a long lesson for everyone involved on how not to build a fighter plane, so whenever we finally scrap it and move onto the next gen, everyone should have a nice long list of things not to do.   This part for example - without the way that it was developed, the F-35 likely would have been significantly more expensive. There are some things that should be learned from, but:   Agreed, but that lesson should have been learned from the F-15. It tried to put every bell and whistle under the hood, and made it a jack of all trades but a master of none. From what I understand the F-16 is the most recent actually good fighter produced.   this is definitely not one of the things that should be taken away, nor should the concept of concurrency. To do so would be to go full circle and reiterate the problems of the 1960s, etc where going with role-limited aircraft severely limited the effective use of air power.  The F-16 for example can hardly be argued as a better fighter than the F-15. Besides the fact that the F-15 gets a far greater kill-to-loss ratio, the F-16 averaged from about 10 crashes a year in the years after it's introduction, due to engineering flaws and a lack of testing."

radiocontrol,36664s,Jmersh,7,Sat May 16 15:08:58 2015 UTC,"No you wont double the C rating, it will stay the same, but you will be able to draw twice as much current out of the battery because its effectively twice the capacity."
radiocontrol,36664s,Tagels,3,Sat May 16 16:35:49 2015 UTC,I agree with this answer.
radiocontrol,36664s,theflyingspaghetti,3,Sat May 16 18:24:26 2015 UTC,"Yes, kind of. The problem is that unless you have a matched pair, one of the batteries will discharge faster than the other.  If you keep your current draw < 90% of the rated C (for each battery) you'll be ok.  When you charge them, do so separately.  Example: 2 @ 3s 2200mAh, 20C.  In Parallel.    You effectively have a 3S 4400mAh 40C.  You probably don't want to pull more than about 36C which in ideal conditions is 18C from each.  Ideal doesn't happen, One battery could put out 20C and the other 16C.  You don't want to push too hard, give it some breathing room.  What's a matched pair you ask?  The internal resistance of the battery packs need to be the same, so that when you draw power from the battery pair, it draws the same power from each.   If one battery has less resistance then more power will be drawn from it as its 'easier' to extract.  Conversely the battery with higher resistance will have give up less power given the same conditions.   So, the battery with low resistance will drop below safe voltage first, which is bad.  EDIT:  I was thinking Current, not C rating.  Twice the Current available at the Leads of the paralleled pack."
radiocontrol,36664s,Hystus,3,Sat May 16 16:27:13 2015 UTC,"Yes, kind of.   No, not at all.   2 @ 3s 2200mAh, 20C. In Parallel. You effectively have a 3S 4400mAh 40C   No, you have a 3S 4400mAh 20C.   So, the battery with low resistance will drop below safe voltage first, which is bad.   The batteries will be at the same voltage, all the time, since they're connected together.  Running batteries in parallel is not as hard as people think. Connect them when they're the same voltage. Charge them in parallel if you want. Keep an eye on the cell voltages like you would any other lipo."
radiocontrol,36664s,MystX,2,Sun May 17 03:37:35 2015 UTC,"You can pull 20C from each pack. So 20C from pack A + 20C from pack B = 40C Total.    EDIT: yes, you're right.  I was thinking CURRENT not C rating.  Gah!  You're right about the output battery voltage of the pair. Ideally, there would be a circuit to prevent the undervoltage battery from being back charged from the higher voltage battery.  Could be as simple as 2 diodes. they aren't efficient, it's just an example.  Charging in Parallel is probably a bad idea unless you can monitor each cell individually.  Parallel cells can have slightly different mAh ratings. 2200mAh is nominal.  Two in parallel can lead to one of the cells getting slightly overcharged and the other undercharged.  Parallel charging is bad.   Serial Charging is fine.   Make a harness to put them in serial and make it 'look' like a 6s 2200mAh to the charger.  Balancing chargers know how to deal with voltage equalization."
radiocontrol,36664s,Hystus,1 point,Sun May 17 03:56:10 2015 UTC,"You don't have to worry about ""back charging"" as that's not really how it works. You don't need diodes and one battery cannot have less voltage than the other one. It's impossible.   Parallel cells can have slightly different mAh ratings   This is also true for your example of charging in serial.  Parallel charging is not ""bad"", you buy a parallel balance port cable and your charger monitors the voltage of a pair of cells instead of each cell, exactly the same as it normally does. Why do you think parallel charging boards exist?"
radiocontrol,36664s,MystX,2,Sun May 17 04:13:37 2015 UTC,"In addition, one battery may be slightly more charged. Most of the current would come from the higher voltage battery (assuming you have reverse current protection). Without reverse protection, the higher voltage battery will cause a lot of current to flow to the weaker battery when you initially connect them"

radiocontrol,35z8y4,AgCat1340,1 point,Thu May 14 19:31:14 2015 UTC,What are the spars made from?  What other materials besides political signs do you use?  I like em!
radiocontrol,35z8y4,AgCat1340,3,Thu May 14 20:08:18 2015 UTC,"Traditional spad spars are made of wooden yard sticks. The spar in the Edge is a yardstick glued and zip tied to a thick chunk of foam. I usually buy 1/4"" thick lattice from the hardware store though. I can cut it to the length I need and it's generally a bit better piece of wood than yardsticks.  Political signs are 4mm. I sometimes use signs for interior parts that will not be seen, but for the most part I buy fresh 2mm for skins and wings and 4mm for control surfaces."
radiocontrol,35z8y4,shitterplug,1 point,Thu May 14 20:16:47 2015 UTC,What kind of glue?
radiocontrol,35z8y4,galorin,3,Thu May 14 20:18:47 2015 UTC,"Depends on what kind of build time and what kind of joint you need.   If you want to just press it together and have it stick, I pour a little acetone on the plastic and rough it up with a scotchbrite pad or fine steel wool, wipe it clean, then use medium CA (super glue).   You can't use CA on foam, so if I am gluing foam or just need a longer build time I use Gorilla Glue. You can poke a bunch of little holes in one side of the coroplast when using Gorilla glue for a stronger hold. The glue foams up, goes through the holes and expands on the other side, works like hundreds of tiny rivets. You can also mix the gorilla glue with a little water before applying. It makes it foam up more and set faster, but the joint isn't quite as strong.   If you need a REALLY strong joint, 5 or 30 minute epoxy is best."

radiocontrol,35z8y4,11e10,1 point,Fri May 15 04:34:01 2015 UTC,"That hasn't been my experience at all. Several years back a friend of mine gave me his combat fleet including 6 or 7 Norvel .25's The original Russian built Norvel company had gone out of business and it was hard to get parts. I understand that they have sold off their designs and ""new"" Novels are available. I haven't tried any of those, but the ones I have will out pace an OS .25 FX all day. On a 9x4 they will pull a stock dogfighter close to 85. The only issue I have is that when pulling sustained G loads, they get fuel starved and bog down."

Do you know if he ever got around to uploading his set of plans?  I think they are significantly better than the ones I have... heck, the ones I have aren't even real plans, more instructions for drawing.  Then again... a Corsair is probably not the right thing for a first-time pilot to be building.  I'm thinking more along the lines of the SPAD mini-pizza box flyer or Buhor 25 with electric motor adaptations."

radiocontrol,35ymyh,Pedofalap,2,Thu May 14 19:52:20 2015 UTC,Took about half a day of working on and off.   Its an intermediate difficulty building process. The most difficult part was fusing the main body/wing together from 4 different pieces because the plans were way bigger than my 20x30 adams board. I build with adams dollartree foam board so I had to resize a lot of slots and holes to fit my 5mm foam. Its mostly a big origami project.

radiocontrol,35yopl,IvorTheEngine,3,Thu May 14 17:31:23 2015 UTC,Pretty much the only advantage of a hex is that it won't crash immediately if one motor stops working - unless you're building such a big one that you can't get motors big enough.

There's also this thing from Parrot.  It sounds like you're gonna have trade-offs with ground speed vs flight speed. Personally, I would try to make it primarily a flyer, with some lightweight wheels so it can roll around.  Another idea would be to not power the wheels, but use the props to move around."

The jet guys at my field always put on a good show, but with all the modern technology in the control portion of turbines, there's not as much tinkering as you might think.

radiocontrol,35u0no,KillerSpud,2,Wed May 13 15:24:14 2015 UTC,"I really want to be able to do water landings for a couple of reasons:    there are no good places to belly land in the high country around here; even in what small meadows you can find, lurking rocks are a menace. bushes are actually the best location, which is horrible. With the thin air up at 8-10,000 feet, stall speed skyrockets, but glide ratio stays the same. So you've got a plane which is moving at least 30% faster than at sea level, but it still needs the same amount of approach to touch down, and if you over- or under-shoot, everything's way less forgiving."

If you build small and light you can overpower it so launches are super reliable. For example on my 600mm wings I am running 2:1 thrust to weight so any toss works. It will just fly straight on full throttle till I am high enough to turn it over/around or whatever.  Catching alone isn't a viable strategy for fpv wings (too heavy). Two handed catching is showing off mostly, not a good plan for bush flying (always avoid risk of injuey when far away from primary care)."

It's one of my favorite airframes - it's big, relatively aerodynamic, trike landing gear, adaptable battery bay, removable wing, etc. I would consider it slightly underpowered, but I've flown with gopros and whatnot. Just don't expect vertical performance. Recently installed floats - although the takeoff is a little long, it'll land on a dime. Horizon chose a great airfoil and wing loading for this bird, as the stall characteristics are extremely gentile. Parts are easy to find. I will say that having a trike gear may make takeoff/landing difficult if you're landing in long grass or gnarly terrain."

radiocontrol,35rx69,1320Fastback,7,Wed May 13 03:41:37 2015 UTC,It is a Binding plug.  Basically a jumper that allows the receiver to bind/pair with your transmitter.  Here is a short video with the binding procedure.  https://youtu.be/dpXL3fAKcGc

I'm sure this is cheaper. On the other hand, I don't really understand why they've used dummy cells in that power bank instead of just gluing random bits of scrap metal for weight, which must be cheaper. I wonder if whoever made the fake power bank got scammed into buying the dummy cells expecting real (recovered) cells."

radiocontrol,35pdcc,dougmc,2,Tue May 12 19:18:59 2015 UTC,"Yes, there were four cells in parallel - two fakes and two real li-ion. There is indeed voltage regulation circuitry on the PCB which allows normal powerbank behaviour. It charges new li-ion to 4.25V and gives 5V ~1A on the output side.

I've been buying those cheap ~ $20 bicycle lights (like this one though there are many different varieties)  that come with a pretty decent light head and a 2s2p 18650 battery pack.  Measuring the capacity of a few of these packs with my R/C charger I've found some of them to have about 40-60% of the capacity they should have even when fairly new and assuming that they used 2200 mAh cells (about the lowest that I've seen.)

Left rotor produces forward thrust, right backwards and it yaws to the left, and vice-versa. Everything else is pretty self explanatory. Seems like a really neat idea, with a great advantage to lift.

radiocontrol,35ii4t,Scripto23,2,Mon May 11 04:44:04 2015 UTC,"Rolling shutter:       Rolling shutter is a method of image capture in which a still picture (in a still camera) or each frame of a video (in a video camera) is captured not by taking a snapshot of the entire scene at single instant in time but rather by scanning across the scene rapidly, either vertically or horizontally. In other words, not all parts of the image of the scene are recorded at exactly the same instant. (Though, during playback, the entire image of the scene is displayed at once, as if it represents a single instant in time.) This produces predictable distortions of fast-moving objects or rapid flashes of light. This is in contrast with ""global shutter"" in which the entire frame is captured at the same instant.

But this should be pretty good with a good charger. Probably more important, check the specs of your charger and what input voltage range it accepts, the one I have says it'll take 10.5V - 18V DC input. Any lower than the 10.5V may have some funny effects on the charger (nothing dangerous or damaging, probably just the output voltage may not be correct)."
radiocontrol,35agzu,Panglo,3,Fri May 8 14:07:02 2015 UTC,"Exactly this.    As for the ""funny effects on the charger"", the most likely effect is that the charger will shut off or give an error and refuse to charge.  If the charger takes 10-18 volts (and many do) ... a 4s battery will work even better, but 3s is likely fine, though the charger might shut off/stop working before the battery is fully discharged.  Just make sure you monitor the voltage of the battery powering the charger -- don't let it get too low.  (The OP is doing this, so good.)"
radiocontrol,35agzu,dougmc,-2,Fri May 8 18:25:45 2015 UTC,To help with the correct voltage OP could get a 12V step-up/step-down regulator.

radiocontrol,35agzu,Panglo,1 point,Fri May 8 14:40:37 2015 UTC,"Just one more thing to note, the voltage of your lipo's drop as they discharge meaning they may well go below the 11V. I can't say whether this will stop it working at that point though, just something to be wary of."
radiocontrol,35agzu,agenthex,1 point,Fri May 8 18:09:45 2015 UTC,"12.6V is fully charged LiPo. Any significant load is probably going to drop your LiPo voltage below 11V. This may result in low voltage cutoff or undesirable operation. LiPo will be ""low"" at 10.8V (resting, no load) and dead by 9.6V (resting). Voltage will drop in real time relative to current/power consumption, so your mileage will vary.  I would suggest getting a lead acid battery for field charging. 5Ah is nothing."
radiocontrol,35agzu,btpav8n,1 point,Sat May 9 17:18:27 2015 UTC,BEC's usually aren't buck/boost. To get 12V out of the one you linked you would still need over 12V input.

I run two of the Turnigy Accucel 6 chargers with voltage cutoff set to 10.5v. So they automatically shut off before the lipos are on the dangerous low end.

Easy enough to put together, but the 4 screws that attach the wing to the fuse were very hard to screw in.  On launch, I noticed that this thing launches VERY high for its size.  I would say that it launches as high as my Libelle.    Hard launches can bend the wing, which can form stress cracks where the fuse meets the wing.  The plastic nose cone also tends to fly off in hard launches, so be aware.   The best way to launch it is to face your palm up.  Palm down launches can also strain the wing too hard.  Overall, this thing is worth it for $70.  Though it has a few flaws, it gets tons of lift very easily.

radiocontrol,353bev,JohnnieRicoh,1 point,Wed May 6 20:16:23 2015 UTC,I don't believe my optic 6 sport has ppm output.
radiocontrol,353bev,dougmc,2,Wed May 6 21:45:26 2015 UTC,"The old Optic 6 was Spectra module compatible, so they definitely did have PPM.  The Hitec Spectra modules worked in Futaba gear (even though they weren't FCC certified), so I see no reason why it wouldn't go the other way, and so I'd expect this to work just fine on one of those.  That said, it looks like the newer Optic 6 Sport doesn't have the module, so it won't be that easy.  Looking at the manual, it does have a buddy box connector, and it's compatible with other Hitec radios (not just the Optic 6 Sport) so that is almost certainly PPM.  So you could wire something into that, or you could open the radio up and wire something into the signal that goes into the buddy box and do it ""neater"" (built into the TX), but I don't think there's going to be a drop-in replacement like you could have with the original Optic 6.  You should be able to to do something like this -- but of course where you wire stuff will be different.  As for the TX module, this would probably be the right choice.  (I assume this is smart enough to be able to deal with both positive and negative shift on the PPM signal.)  edit: and it looks like JohnnieRicoh had already come to the same conclusions."
radiocontrol,353bev,cb600fshornet,1 point,Wed May 6 22:29:48 2015 UTC,"You can get compatible receivers from HobbyKing for a very reasonable price (from 7GBP to 13GBP)  The Hitec 2.4GHz system is much more reliable than DSM2, on the Hitec system it hops between various 2.4GHz channels, and in scan mode it detects any interference on other channels, and avoids them. The Spektrum DSM2 technology picks two random channels when the transmitter/receiver combination boots up and only transmits on those two fixed channels. Sometimes these two channels are very close together so interference can knock out the connection totally.  If you want to go with Spektrum, use DSMX, DSM2 is a bit risky."

The Parkzone Sukhoi or the Visionaire would be good choices to start with, with my vote going to the Sukhoi based on looks and my experience with the Visionaire. There are some full fuse EPP models from Aerobeez that would be good too, but the cost of building one would be significantly higher than an RTF Inverza or Viking."

They are a bit sensitive to wind, but they are cheap, don't need a lot of space to fly, and can take a pretty good beating. I have one of these (not my video): https://youtu.be/SrsbJuCTRIo"
radiocontrol,34wmo1,djtogi,1 point,Tue May 5 05:29:20 2015 UTC,"These planes you consider are quite small, they are thus fast. A bigger wingspan and bigger wing planform will make it float better and easier to practice with. Also most EPP models seem to be bigger. I can personally vouch for the hobbyking reaktor. But considering your budget, take a look at the techone tempo. These are topnotch EPP foamies. The best part about these is, tone down your rates and you can fly it like a normal plane. These planes never fly as thight as epo, but you don't need to worry about a rough landing or light crash. And you can fly them everywhere, add to that my reaktor uses 2s 850 zippy compact, which is more than enough for unlimited vertical and they are dirt cheap."
radiocontrol,34wmo1,planesnstuff,1 point,Tue May 5 12:01:09 2015 UTC,"I have the Inverza and sold my Viking. I did not like the way the Viking handled or the soft foam they used for the body. The Inverza and Edge 540QQ are fast but aerobatic, but a lot of fun. If you are going to be doing 3D, I agree with baba that the Visionaire might be the way you want to go. It is a slow speed and incredibly floaty plane. Easy to fly and land. Plus the latest one has lights and looks great at night (https://youtu.be/D0SpKktqxLM). The Sukhoi is a bit heaver and you need to keep some throttle going when landing. Not really good for flying in a street. I fly that the least of all my planes. I also have two profile foamies and while they fly different, I started hovering by practicing on them and you can fly them just about anywhere. The EPP ones can take a beating.  I'd say Visionaire or Inverza and pick up a profile foamy later for fun."

If you have flaps set up half flap for no load and full flap for any load or battery >2000mah. Remember you'll need a bit more power with flaps because they create drag, even with the reduced stall speed.  Learn on a windless day with no AP or stab. Then move onto wind, then more complex maneuvers. Once you learn your aircraft add an AP to make it easier. Never add an AP to supplement your skills, you'll become a statistic and we will laugh at you.  Bixler 3 has a maximum head/tail/crosswind of approx 10/0/3 kt."

radiocontrol,34nayj,Chrthiel,2,Sun May 3 07:59:50 2015 UTC,"From what I understand they're trying to build a scale prototype of what would become a full-scale UAV.  Having 10 motors adds significantly to the cost, complexity, and potential failure points.  The term ""Keep it simple, stupid"" should be used as much as possible while designing aircraft.  All aircraft have mandatory service intervals where after X hours of flight time engines need to be serviced or replaced.  This labor and parts cost is literally multiplied by ten every time a service interval is met.  Imagine if you had to change your oil on ten separate little motors every 3000 miles on your car and change 60 spark plugs and rotate 40 tires.... Then there's the added weight/cost of 10 separate engine management systems, 10 sets of fuel lines, 10 propeller assemblies, 10 motor mounts.  What works in scale on electric will go up exponentially in combustion.  There is no practical reason to do with 10 motors what can be achieved with 4."
radiocontrol,34nayj,Jmersh,2,Sun May 3 13:34:45 2015 UTC,"Distributed electric propulsion is a big in aerospace right now, not saying it makes sense necessarily but the idea is redundancy. Joby and zee.aero are doing it on for small personal aircraft for example.  This is never intended to have 10 IC motors, a larger version would have a single diesel engine running a generator which runs electric motors (much lower maintenance cost than IC and more efficient.) There's also some notion that you can use distributed propulsion for control if primary flight surfaces go out, get some aerodynamic 'efficiency' advantage (still really not convinced on that one....) etc."

radiocontrol,34o1qo,Gavitron,1 point,Mon May 4 02:19:02 2015 UTC,"I'd actually suggest starting with a $100 HobbyZone Champ. Since you're only wanting to spend $200 total, and that price needs to include a transmitter as well as the plane, you won't be able to buy a truly decent transmitter and a decent plane at the same time.   So start by spending $100 on a Champ, which comes with its own transmitter, and then if you really enjoy the hobby and want to go further, save up a few more bucks and buy a decent multi-plane transmitter, like the $130 Spektrum dx6i. You'll then be able to use the better transmitter with the Champ until you buy another plane, at which point, you'll be able to continue using the transmitter for both planes (up to 6 total).  On its own, the Champ is a really great plane to learn on and it's so fun you'll continue to fly it even after you've learned the ropes (I do!) It's good to learn on because a.) it's durable, b.) it's easy and c.) it's not super fast, which means you don't need a huge area to fly in.  Later, you can ""step up"" to bigger, faster planes, which the DX6i will continue to support and you'll be able to use its more advanced features."

radiocontrol,34jyy2,SamMaghsoodloo,2,Fri May 1 20:23:27 2015 UTC,"There is a lot you could salvage from that, although if you are just getting started there won't be much for you straight away.  The electronics should most likely be in working condition. The Fuselage doesn't even look that badly damaged and looks easily salvageable. Are there wings with it? Even if those are broken, the whole plane may be able to fly again. If you don't have them, you can buy or make replacements.  Unfortunately, EDF's (Electric Ducted fan) models are not really for beginners though. You may be able to use the receiver, battery, servos and ESC in a different plane. The ESC is a big one though, so probably beyond anything that you will need in a starter plane.  Edit to add: I saw the other posts about contacting local hobby stores, and I would agree, but due to the timetable, you may just want to put it up on eBay or something,... someone will want that and you may get enough to trade for a small starter plane.  So many new planes are available as RTF (ready to fly) though, that you may be better off with a whole new setup.  For a scratch builder, or someone willing to put in some work, there's definitely something there."
radiocontrol,34jyy2,sunfishtommy,1 point,Sat May 2 00:33:43 2015 UTC,"You can use the reciever and the speed controller.  That should save you about 100 bucks if you were going to buy expensive stuff.  You could have bought cheaper versions of those same parts, though, for about 40 bucks.

Orientation is more difficult than a normal plane and there's no dihedral in the wings to help you level out. While they can fly slowly, they can get fast, fast.  Definitely one to get as a second or third real plane, but not good for a first.

I have a 25c-50c 5000mah 6s turnigy nano-tech (part of the deal) and I'm trying to determine if I'm getting healthy flight times.  Does you main shaft have any vertical play at all?   Are you using the stock ESC? I find mine starts pretty hard so the rotors slap the blade grips a bit. I need to follow the instructions on setting the ESC to super soft start.

Have it fly up there, then push itself against the wall and move around on the wall like a car (with wheels!) for precise control.  Give it several different colors of paint so it can do something in full color.  Allow it to draw complicated things -- ideally fully automatically and quickly, but if it's manually controlled at that time, then so be it.  But this?  This aint cool, and if this is the best this guy can come up with ... then clearly we need a hacker to go to the graffiti side (or work with a grafitti guy) rather than a graffiti guy to dabble in the hacker side of things.  Or maybe we just need a more clever graffiti guy.  And even if I can appreciate that there's much unrealized potential for coolness here ... I can still also feel sad at the same time for how it will be abused (and how this asshole abused it) and how people will overreact against that.  Already the media is full of stories where people claim that somebody was hovering a ""drone"" outside their window, and this will be just another nail in that coffin.  That said ... if somebody builds up a decent grafitti device like this, and uses it where they're allowed to put up their art, out in the open and they do a good job ... that could be pretty cool.

I can appreciate good graffiti ... but this isn't it.  It isn't even a good proof of concept ... he could have done so much better.  But as it stands, with this stunt ... he's not being an artist.

radiocontrol,34evgp,Entenna,2,Thu Apr 30 19:21:53 2015 UTC,the 90 degree FOV on the Hero 3 is achieved by reducing the resolution way down. Might not matter for your application but it should be noted.
radiocontrol,34evgp,dougmc,2,Thu Apr 30 19:46:29 2015 UTC,"If I recall correctly, the Hero 3 Silver has a 5 megapixel sensor.  Full HD only uses 2 megapixels (1920x1080) so it's just a matter of picking which pixels make it to the video -- you can take those from a box in the middle, which gives you a low FOV and little barrel distortion (fish-eye), or you can take them from the entire sensor (but still, only 40% of them) which gives you a wide FOV and more barrel distortion.  The Hero 2 and the Hero 3 Black and 3+ Silver have a sensor with more than 5 megapixels, so you can have more options, but that's still what it boils down to -- by picking which pixels are saved and which are thrown out, you pick the FOV of your video and how much barrel distortion you get.  For a given lens, a wider FOV = more barrel distortion.  If you're just taking pictures rather than video, usually the best plan is to take pictures using the highest resolution (and therefore the highest FOV, with the highest barrel distortion) that the sensor offers and then you can process the results into what you need on the ground -- if you want low barrel distortion and low FOV, you just crop the pictures to the desired degree."

radiocontrol,34c68e,Mike12344321,2,Fri May 1 00:55:41 2015 UTC,"It seems to me like you are still confusing your different radio systems.  So, to control a RC vehicle, you need a control radio. A control radio can come in 3 different frequencies:   72 MHz, a very old standard that is falling out of use, but still has some significant pluses that are still relevant in the hobby, especially for FPV; 433 MHz, a new long-range system for control that is powerful and complicated, but has great returns and penetration; 2.4 GHz, a VERY popular radio system that is ubiquitous, cheap, reliable, and simple to use;.   In addition to the control radio, to properly view the images that is sent back from the quad, you will need a separate system called a video radio. The control radio and the video radio are isolated systems and do not interact with each other, however they do have the ability to interfere with one another. More on interference later, but for now, a video radio comes in 4 common frequencies, in order of video quality and in reverse order of transmitted distance:   5.8 GHz, a very popular and relatively weak frequency that is able to transmit a large amount of data a short distance, resulting in excellent video in short ranges; 2.4 GHz, a relatively rare frequency; 1.3 GHz, a popular and powerful frequency that balances transmitted distance and image quality; 900 MHz, an extremely powerful, long range frequency that has excellent penetration.   Interference is a complicated topic, but can be summed up into two simple rules: Don't run 2.4 GHz control and 2.4 Ghz video together, and don't run 2.4 GHz control and 1.3 GHz video together. The most common system for beginners is 2.4 GHz control and 5.8 GHz video.  Now, on to the items you selected. The control system you purchased or indicated you want to purchase includes the receiver, so in this sense it is a totally inclusive system that is plug-and-play with any multirotor; simply drop the included receiver in and hook it up to start flying around. The video radio you posted is the correct frequency (5.8 GHz), but is only the transmitter portion of the radio system. You will need an additional item to view the image on the ground, a 5.8 GHz video receiver.  TLDR: If your question is ""Will these items work together to provide me with control and video?"", the answer is no. They are two different systems and are separate. If your question is ""Can I use these two different systems together on one multirotor without causing interference?"", the answer is yes.  Note: I do not recommend the items you selected. Unless you are on a budget, your control needs will be better served with a FrSky Taranis, a 16 channel radio that can be found for approx $220ish. As cliche as it sounds, it will grow with you. Never buy anything less than 8 channels, you'll outgrow it in a few months. I also recommend a RMRC FPV starter package, vice picking out all the parts manually from amazon. This will ensure that you have all the correct parts that have been proven to work together, the first time. I highly recommend saving up and waiting if you cannot afford ~$500 combined for both the control and video radio systems. Buying cheap radio components is a surefire way to get bummed out either because it craps out mid-flight and wrecks your plane, or because you never figure out the proper connections and get discouraged. It's better to buy the good kit once, then buy the bad kit, try to save your investment in the bad kit, and then eventually buy the good kit when the bad kit kicks the bucket."

I thought both signals went through the same transmitter on the Quad, meaning I needed the Frequencies of both to match.   I highly recommend saving up and waiting if you cannot afford ~$500 combined for both the control and video radio systems.   I completely agree with you, I don't want to pay out a little now just so I have to double/triple it later.   Understanding the build quality, I am still very new to this, and I am on a budget, so I would like to get a hold of one to play with and learn on it before I sink $1000+ setup on a Racing Quad w/FPV, if I was not so broke I would be taking the leap; FatShark Dominator w/ head tracking, directional antennas, and OSD in a heart beat.   So, to control a RC vehicle, you need a control radio.   Assuming that the build I linked above can trade out parts, I'm taking your advice and saving up for the bigger channel radio.

How do I fix this?"
radiocontrol,34b74w,IvorTheEngine,1 point,Wed Apr 29 21:23:10 2015 UTC,"That sound like the swash plate has separated. It's a bearing, with the lower half connected to the servos and the upper half connected to the rotor head. It's fairly common for the bearing to pop out of one or other plastic piece.  Try just pushing it back together, if it comes out again glue it back together with superglue. To make sure you don't use too much and have it ooze into the bearing, put a drop on a bit of scrap card and use a toothpick to put a thin smear on the plastic bits.  If that doesn't make sense, please post a photo."

Very often around them is cooler air wanting to get down. Watch for one wing to either dip or bump up. Steer towards the wing that bumps up and you will find the thermal. Some thermals will be small and others can be massive, same goes for the cool downward air. Keep your plane as flat as possible while circling, lots of rudder and opposite aileron. Watch for the wing bumps.   If you get in a cold thermal where there is cooler air forcing your plane down faster than your normal glide plane get moving and get the hell out of there. Check out your flight area also, is there a blacktop parking lot close that might be the source of thermals or even the color of the grass can cause thermals to pop. Hills and buildings can steer wind currents so that you are in a thermal dead spot. Your stronger thermals will normally pop in the morning while the air is cool and the heat concentrators start making bigger temperature differences.   As with all things, some days you will get nothing but three minute flights and other days you have a full day of hour long flights."

radiocontrol,3497ow,freewarefreak,1 point,Wed Apr 29 12:57:37 2015 UTC,I'm waiting to buy the Electrohub Kit from FliteTest. It's out of stock currently but you can also buy it with the electronics kit for $158. This can make a quadcopter or tricopter of any size.
radiocontrol,3497ow,NinjaSix50,1 point,Wed Apr 29 15:50:18 2015 UTC,Just built one. I've barely flown it but I already fuckin love it   Highly recommend the RTFQUADS power pack
radiocontrol,3497ow,OnceYouGoJack,1 point,Wed Apr 29 16:13:20 2015 UTC,How well do the 250s do in a bit of wind?  (5MPH) When I mentioned upgrading it was more along the lines of upgrading/tinkering a 250 type model.  I flew the blade 350 and it's great to fly but as you mentioned it isn't something that could utilize all the awesome FPV electronics for the 250.

radiocontrol,3497ow,Micubano,1 point,Wed Apr 29 22:34:34 2015 UTC,I was wondering if you could help piece together everything I would need on Rotorgeeks (or smilar site) minus the transmitter and charger. It would have to be a Spektrum rx for my DX5E.  Since I'm new to FPV it would be a big help seeing a cart of all the parts I would need.  I can toss it together but there's all the little things like what frame to start out with or if it's worth getting the better motor.  I'm having trouble finding any sites that do full assembly of a 250.  I have 3 crawler kits I'm currently finishing up and would love to be able to have a big jump start right out of the box.    Any help would be very much appreciated.
radiocontrol,3497ow,Micubano,1 point,Thu Apr 30 03:38:02 2015 UTC,"Soooo Rotorgeeks will sell everything you need to build a quad. On their site there's a ""combo deal"" called ""Build a Quad""  Their customer service is amazing and I've spoken with him on the phone several times to help tune and fix.    Pick whichever frame you want (cheap is fiiiine!)   Acro Naze is good  I've got the Cobra 1960kv motors and they're plenty quick.  For spektrum, there's a ""DSMX"" or ""DSM2"" option on the build a quad section  Definitely pick the ""Solder Service"" option.  He even includes a power distribution board, all of the wires/props/etc that you'll need.  Just solder the ESCs to the power board, solder the battery connector on, connect the ESCs to the motors and put everything together.  I'd get the ESC USB programmer option, too.  Helps for quick motor reversals etc."

I have only flown for a cumulative 60-90 minutes with the AA's that came with the transmitter, so I think they would be OK.   I will pop the top off tomorrow and look at the receiver, but when I had to glue the last time it looked OK. Not sure what I would look for on an intermittent issue.   What exactly is a range check? I have had it fail to adjust within 50 feet and work fine at 100+ feet. It almost felt like someone had a jammer or something and was messing with me.  On another note, is it OK to keep taping the same spot over and over when taking the plane apart?"

radiocontrol,344kus,MatusisDrake,2,Tue Apr 28 06:35:21 2015 UTC,Are you using a balance board? On my IMax B6 Duo the other day I had one cell on a 6S 1300 registering as really low. It turned out that when I put the lipo in the lipo fire bag I pulled out the balance board a little. I reseated it and it was fine. If you are using a balance board you can unplug it and try plugging the balance lead on the battery right into the charger to see if that makes a difference. Just make sure you get the pins on right with the black wire all the way over on the negative pin
radiocontrol,344kus,Micubano,3,Tue Apr 28 13:33:48 2015 UTC,In his picture he's plugging the balance plug right into the charger
radiocontrol,344kus,freewarefreak,1 point,Tue Apr 28 15:51:44 2015 UTC,Didn't see the pic. I thought it was a link to the charger.
radiocontrol,344kus,Micubano,1 point,Tue Apr 28 19:21:40 2015 UTC,It's this charger here. It's got a balancing board built in and I have the battery plugged directly into it.  I've checked to make sure the connection is firm and the individual wires are seated correctly.  I haven't pulled them out and recrimped them.  Do you think I should?
radiocontrol,344kus,Micubano,2,Tue Apr 28 17:27:23 2015 UTC,"Now that I see the pics it looks like you are doing everything right. Do not use the discharge function on the battery until you are going to throw it out. You can try running storage on it. That balances the batteries down to 3.8. You mentioned you have more than one battery. Are they balancing OK? If they are, then that battery might have issues. If not, the charger might have issues. I don't think recrimping would help unless one of the cells was not being read at all.  I've had a few batteries where one cell read lower during the first few times balancing and it took a few cycles before they were all even, but not that low."
radiocontrol,344kus,swegin122,2,Tue Apr 28 19:30:22 2015 UTC,"It sort of sounds like either the cells aren't connected to each other inside the battery very well, or the balancer on your charger is dead. I wouldn't charge it more without getting it balanced since that 1 cell could get overcharged. I'd try the storage mode and see if that would get all 3 cells to 3.8v, then either try a balance charge again, or try a normal/non-balance charge to see if the cells all get charged or if it just goes to that 1 cell. If the balance charge doesn't work but normal charge does, then the balancer is dead. you could still use the charger by using an external balancer."
radiocontrol,344kus,mabasakura,1 point,Tue Apr 28 18:18:47 2015 UTC,It depends on what your batteries are. Are they LiPos or NiCd or Lead? Did you input the correct battery settings on the charger? Different batteries charges differently.

radiocontrol,341yr5,frothface,2,Mon Apr 27 19:12:46 2015 UTC,Yep. Before you ask they are pretty loud so yes you will hear it while its in the air.
radiocontrol,341yr5,dougmc,2,Tue Apr 28 00:34:09 2015 UTC,"It does omit one useful fact -- this alarm can be used on packs that are more than 4s as well -- it won't explicitly monitor the cells above #4, but given that all the cells should have approximately the same voltage, if one of the cells over 4 is too low, the odds are that one of the cells under 4 is too low as well and that'll set the alarm off."

radiocontrol,341yr5,dougmc,4,Mon Apr 27 19:45:21 2015 UTC,"It's really not that hard to do.   most ESCs have a low voltage cutoff that cut power to the motor when the voltage goes low.  (Note that this is a very bad thing to have enabled on a multicopter!  Better to ruin your batteries than have one ESC cut off before the others, or to have them all cut off!  At least with a standard helicopter you can land via autorotation, but not a multicopter!) even without that, a LiPo at 4.2 volts will put out about double the power as one at 3.0 volts (just about dead, and already lower than you should go!), so you'll very much notice the reduction in power that you've got as it starts to approach that level. many of us do use alarms that will warn us -- just plug them into the balancing port. telemetry is an option, though I imagine most of us don't have it yet, and  simply timing your flights will work pretty well, especially if you have a TX that you can tie the timer to the throttle -- count time as long as the throttle is at least 20%, for example."

radiocontrol,341yr5,sschering,2,Mon Apr 27 22:15:01 2015 UTC,"If you weren't to use a low voltage alarm, just set a timer.  You could easily take, let's say, a 5 minute flight. Come down, check your cells. If they're around 3.8V, then you've found pretty much your full flight time. You could probably add another 30s-1min on.  Now just set your timer to 5 minutes and fly like that."
radiocontrol,341yr5,Airazz,2,Tue Apr 28 00:23:15 2015 UTC,"All the ESC's I fly with have a Low voltage cutoff.  Well not so much cutoff as drop in power.. it's quite noticeable but you have enough power left to wing around and land.  I have Hobby Kings, Turniggy, Castle.. they all have an LVC."
radiocontrol,341yr5,wolfcry0,2,Mon Apr 27 20:17:14 2015 UTC,"Most ESCs will shut down the motor once the battery is close to empty. Usually you can adjust the voltage and how it will act once it reaches that voltage. Mine simply drops the max revs down by 50%, so I know that it's time to land but I still have some power to do it.   It will not cut the power to the servos."
radiocontrol,341yr5,btpav8n,2,Mon Apr 27 21:00:45 2015 UTC,"For planes you can use the ESCs under voltage cut-off if it has it, that's the simplest method as it doesn't need any extra parts, but a downside is you might end up having to glide into a landing  The other option is a low voltage alarm, they're just insanely loud beepers that you can hear from quite far away  And finally there's telemetry systems for radios that support them, so you can see your voltage remotely and have an alarm on your transmitter itself"
radiocontrol,341yr5,swegin122,1 point,Mon Apr 27 23:50:47 2015 UTC,"Almost all ESC's have low voltage cutoff, when you get down to some set voltage they can either decrease power (soft cut) or shut down the motors (hard cut.)

When you say it drives forward, do you mean slowly, but faster when you throttle up?  If so, then the trim on the throttle channel needs to be lowered, perhaps all the way down.

It works well on plastic and metal and it comes with the oil pen type tip on the bottle. I go though about a bottle a year and I'm on my 4th bottle. I also use it on my 3D printer and anything else that needs a little oil.
radiocontrol,343qyy,Micubano,1 point,Tue Apr 28 19:52:47 2015 UTC,"Honestly a 200 srx will not need much lubrication. A little silicone grease on the main shaft is probably all you will need (if that and only if you are removing/replacing the main shaft). Lubricating helicopters is more for collective pitch. They have considerably more moving parts on the head and tail. I never lubricated my 200 SRX and never had a problem. Also excess lubrication tends to collect dust and dirt, so be careful not to apply big globs of silicone grease if you do lube your 200 SRX."
radiocontrol,343qyy,Anoma1y,2,Tue Apr 28 07:06:23 2015 UTC,"But which one, silicone oil or lithium grease? I have lithium grease in the servos when I replace the gears"
radiocontrol,343qyy,Anoma1y,1 point,Tue Apr 28 08:07:26 2015 UTC,"I believe either would work. The main difference between lithium and silicone grease is that lithium grease is petroleum based, which means you should keep it away from rubber and plastic. I doubt that the lithium grease would hurt any of the plastic in a short amount of time, but why risk it is how I feel. Silicone grease is like $2 at lowes or homedepot in the plumbing area. Also I know a ton of people use triflow on their larger helicopters and it seems to work well, however, these helicopters are usually made mostly of carbonfiber and metal."

""3D"" usually refers to the ability to fly inverted, which is only something that a few micro quads and helis can do.  Did you look for your nearest RC club? It might be nearer than you think, with a nice field.  There are a few small planes, such as the Night Vapor or the Champ.  You could get an RC car. They don't need as much space and can be used in an empty parking lot, or on your street if it's not too busy.  Or a simulator. Sit inside and pretend to fly! :)"
radiocontrol,33yyn6,R1cket,1 point,Mon Apr 27 00:59:46 2015 UTC,Any suggestions on a small heli or quad kit? Or parts to make one?
radiocontrol,33yyn6,R1cket,0,Mon Apr 27 02:18:05 2015 UTC,"Syma S107 is a cheap first heli. Unfortunately the battery is non-replaceable, so you'll have long wait times between the flights (flight time for a heli is typically 5-8 minutes, no matter what size or battery). Blade mCX2 is a good quality one but more expensive -- fully 4 channel, which is great if you want to move up to more serious helis, and comes with 1 battery, make sure to buy more and then you can fly and charge at the same time. I don't know about others, I have a mCX2 myself, it was my first serious RC heli.  For quads, Hubsan X4 H107L. Don't get one with a camera, it'll only disappoint (crappy quality, and the quad won't fly very well because of the extra weight). Just my opinion of course. Get extra propellers and batteries. If you want a TINY quad, look into the Cheerson CX-10 - but again, non-replaceable battery there, so 6-8min flight and then long charge time (30min? 1hr? I'm not sure).  For other suggestions, you could search this subreddit (search box is in top right corner) using keywords like 'beginner' 'first' 'quad' 'quadcopter' and trying the different sorting options (relevance, votes, recent)."

radiocontrol,33yyn6,felixthemaster1,1 point,Mon Apr 27 21:44:45 2015 UTC,"I suggest getting a nanocpx or a mcpx. Both are great micro helis which can do 3d but most importantly, they are durable, will teach you collective management, and you can (infact the nano is made for) fly inside the house.  Quads, I feel you;ll get bored of after a few weeeks especially since you dont have much room but with a heli there are so much stuff you can do after mastering basic flight and hovering, like inverted stuff and 3d. I felt the same way you did as well but you'll open up to 3d later down the road after you've done your fair share of normal flying.  If not a cp, you could get a blade 200 SRX which is an fp so its a lot simpler and easier to fix and will last int he wind better than these much smaller helis I mentioned (more f a 100ish size). It would be easier to learn hovering and basic flight with and you can have a ton of fun with it without worry of losing it in the sky or crashing. It has 3 modes (beginner and intermediate self level like quads which you can have fun with and expert you can fly like a real heli and practice serious stuff with and pull off loops and stuff)."
radiocontrol,33yyn6,R1cket,1 point,Mon Apr 27 18:53:14 2015 UTC,"Nano CP X is an advanced heli, not a first helicopter (probably not even a second). mCP X is also advanced, only the BL version is sold nowadays and that one has WAY too much power for a beginner. Collective pitch is not something that a beginner needs to be worrying about. After learning to hover, maybe doing some forward flight, then you learn to use throttle hold and then you get a collective pitch copter. Of course you could shortcut this by using a simulator. Did you actually start with one of these helis as your first one?  200 SRX could be a beginner heli, but depends on just how small a space OP is talking about. Learning to fly a helicopter in a cramped space is stressful, not fun. At a soccer field? Definitely fly the 200 SRX, it'll feel like you've got all the space in the world. In your bedroom? Nope, you could hover it but not much more than that (and for an absolute beginner it'd probably be dangerous and very quickly end in crash). Also 200 SRX surely would be less durable than a micro copter."

Your point about the nano and mcp;x is good, but i feel like you can tame them down a lot, also it's a great choice due to his space and also they don't really break (the nano anyways).

radiocontrol,33yyn6,R1cket,1 point,Mon Apr 27 21:20:52 2015 UTC,"We're probably just going to have to disagree, we have different first experiences I guess. I refuse to believe that a collective pitch helicopter is a good thing to recommend as a very first helicopter purchase, there is no way this is the case. To say it can be tamed down, a beginner is not going to know how to tame it down. It just adds unnecessary complexity. A beginner just needs to practice hovering and orientations. You criticized my suggestions that ""he might get off the hobby"" but I think this is the best way to put someone off the hobby.  I know a guy who is exactly the type who would be into R/C, but his only experiences were with a couple advanced planes including a fast delta wing (someone at the hobby shop probably recommended them to him with excuses like these, ""you can tame it down, reduce the rates"", ""if you crash, don't worry it doesn't really break""). Now he stays away from R/C because he thinks it's all crashing and fixing.   Suggesting a self leveling heli will just teach him bad habits.   So you suggest the 200 SRX, a fixed pitch helicopter that self-levels in beginner and intermediate modes, in addition to enforcing a flight envelope...  Self leveling does not scar you for life, it's like training wheels. I think the 200 SRX is a great option if he can find a good size area for it and can be very patient with learning. Absolutely a great second helicopter after learning a little on a micro, hands-down."

Also, if you are pretty sure you want to pursue RC flying I would highly recommend getting a simulator for the computer. Realflight and Phoenix are the most popular,  but there are plenty of others. A good sim will save you tons of money, give you more confidence,  and allow you to fly on days you aren't able to  get to the field. Well good luck with the hobby.

Honestly though I would highly recommend getting the transmitter and simulator before you buy a plane, or at the same time at least. Just a couple hours on a sim will make the whole process of learning to fly easier. I had Phoenix sim for over a year before I ever got a collective pitch helicopter (very hard to fly) and had no problem flying it just from all the sim practice. A sim might seem expensive at first, but it will save you sooo much money and build time and is the most painless way to learn. Phoenix sim has tons of different planes (unpowered gliders all the way up to huge scale jets with turbines) and helicopters (you may want to try them just for fun). There are some free Sims to try but you'd have to have a transmitter and a way to hook it up to the computer. Im sure a Google search could help if thats a route you want to take.

I would definitely buy the DX6 if you can afford it, its basically the newer better DX6i).  Also you can't go wrong with Phoenix because you get free upgrades and models when they are released. On a side note I would recommend NOT building your first plane. You dont want the worry of wondering if everything is hooked up right in addition to your fears of crashing due to new piloting skills. If you do crash you'll probably always wonder if you set the plane up right. There are so many BNF models, dont feel like you are limited to a Bixler or Radian. There are other training planes that you might want to consider.  Honestly though, everyone enters the hobby differently.

You don't really need flaps, especially as a beginner but it's certainly nice to have the option.  Assuming you go with the Bixler, go with a decent ESC with an SBEC (instead of linear BEC) and go with metal gear servos (digital metal gear if you're feel like spending the extra couple bucks).

radiocontrol,33tuv5,R1cket,1 point,Sat Apr 25 18:17:19 2015 UTC,"So I sanded down the blades so they would fit in the blade grips but the tail rotor ones fit on easily.  BOY does it have power! It's like a whole new beast! Careful though, there is a lot more mass so even the brushless motor stops slowly (before the brushless stops abruptly so if I cut throttle the heli spins to the ground).   Make sure the blades are on straight, otherwise it will topple over when spooling up. Don't do what I did and hold the heli as it spools up. I got hit and it chopped a fair bit of skin on my knuckle off.   batteries last half as long as before, but the power, is insane. I can't imagine this is good for the motor? I'll save these blades for a day in the park.   You know when you cut throttle when the battery is low and sometimes it doesn't listen, and it takes a while for the command to register? Well, it spun for a second or two in a tree and cut a lot of twigs off, but the blades and the heli were fine!"
radiocontrol,33tuv5,R1cket,3,Sat Apr 25 16:06:16 2015 UTC,"This is bad for basically everything - the motor, the ESC (if brushless), the battery... In order for the motor to try to handle the longer blades, it has to draw more amps than normal, so the ESC is going to pass along more amps than it's rated, and the battery is going to go over its rated discharge. Voltage will sag, battery may get warm and the life will be shortened, ESC and motor will get hot and if they get too hot then they die.  Basically it's neat while it lasts but it isn't likely to last long. If you actually want to do this in the long run, attach a wattmeter to actually measure the amp draw, and adjust your throttle low enough where it's not far over the limit, and then it would be okay. But then it'll probably be so low throttle that it'll have less power than with the normal size blades. Probably the normal blades were the best balance of thrust vs amp draw for that size motor.  I overprop my airplane motors a little but use a higher amp ESC and a battery with adequate discharge -- so only the motors get hotter than they should, but with adequate cooling, this can be okay. Still, last time I went one step too far, in the middle of my flight there was a little puff of smoke and my motor stopped spinning. The motor had gotten too hot, melted the wires (in the windings), it was toast. In your case, you have inadequate motor, ESC and battery, so that's a lot of failure points."

What electronics are you using on your X3?"
radiocontrol,33tuv5,R1cket,1 point,Wed May 20 21:20:13 2015 UTC,"Stretch = longer tail boom so it can fly bigger blades.  Bigger blades = more ""floaty"" and less twitchy.  Ikon FBL has a self-level switch, too.  What radio are you using?  Self-level switches require an extra channel on the radio, so if you've got a DX6i it won't work (without some tweaking).  Bigger helis = dangerous in the wrong hands.  Oxy is releasing a stretch kit for theirs that will swing 275-285mm blades. They're also releasing a 3-bladed head for it!  If I didn't just get my X2 I'd 100% get one of those.  The X3 is a serious heli.  High RPM + big enough blades to do serious damage if you get hit.  Jumping from a nano to that is big (strongly recommend the Oxy3 :P  ).  I went from a nano to a 130x to the X5, then down to the X2 and X3 to have something smaller to fly at local fields.  The X5 scares the shit out of me still :P"

The next thing I would do immediately if you're racing is to put tires with lower traction on the rear to be able to kick out the rear in turns.

Sounds like another turbine plane is flying around that we're just not seeing, or the sound is dubbed over. There's no smoke, not heat distortion, nothing. I'm also unaware of a gas turbine that is actually small enough to fit in that little plane, the smallest is a Kolibri. There's one guy who managed to fit one in a plane roughly the same size, but his stall speed is crazy fast, and the plane is basically a blur because it has to fly so fast to generate enough lift.

Keep your TX and especially your RX batteries charged!  If you're flying all day, use a field charger during the day.  Occasionally discharge your RX and TX batteries to measure their capacity if possible, and replace the battery if they've lost much of their capacity.  (Of course, this is all less important with an electric that uses a BEC, because you'll know when the battery on that is getting low because the motor will get slower or turn off.)

radiocontrol,33mu7m,jjmelo,1 point,Thu Apr 23 21:19:20 2015 UTC,"Hi everybody.  I'm looking for some help on balancing my new plane.  I posted some photos of my last home-built and got some great advice on what I was doing wrong.  The advice really helped and the plane (the green melon special) actually flew.  But my flying skills really suck and the plane didn't last long.    Well, this time I've decided to go big!  It's made of about 5 sheets of Dollar Tree foam board using a combination of Flight Test and Experimental Airlines techniques.  The nose is made of a double layer of foam board to help move the weight forward and add additional strength to the nose.  The tail is a single layer of board and the tail surfaces have bamboo skewers glued to the leading edges.  The battery (see photos of battery mount in nose) is moved as far forward as I can to keep the center of gravity forward.  So, my problem is the center of gravity is located almost in the middle of the wing, and I think it needs to be farther forward to around 30% from leading edge.  Is this just a matter of adding more mass to the nose?  Maybe a larger battery?  Have I made the tail too long or the tail surfaces too big?  I still need a lot more practice flying before I try to maiden this thing, so I have time to reconsider the build details.  Any advice or criticisms would be awesome!"

radiocontrol,33m9h9,dougmc,1 point,Fri Apr 24 06:29:27 2015 UTC,"Maybe.  With about 1% of the atmospheric density, you'd need 10x the wind speed to cause the same force as you'd get with our atmosphere.  But with only 1/3rd the gravity, that might translate to only 6x the wind speed needed to to tip it over as would be needed here.  The Viking landers detected wind speeds up to 60 mph -- so that would have the knock-over potential of a 6 mph (or 10 mph?) wind here.  But this thing looks to be really light, and maybe that's enough to knock it over?  That said, given the way it's designed with the coaxial props and how it's so light and how Mars has 1/3rd the gravity we have here -- it may be that the props have enough torque to right itself the moment it starts up.  I imagine that that would have to be part of the design -- something to handle it being tipped over, because that would have to eventually happen, either due to wind, or a poor landing spot, something.  My Blade CX will do that -- if it's tipped over on it's side and I throttle it up, the motors have enough torque that it'll right itself.  It's probably not good for the ESCs, but it can do it."

At the very least you need something like a Mega, or, even better (and this is my plan) something like a Due with a 32-bit ARM micro. The great thing about the APM is that you can program it just like an Arduino, so spend the $70 or so (you can find good deals on eBay) and you'll have a much better time.  The other advantage of starting with the APM is that all the necessary hardware is included on-board (with the exception of the compass, usually bundled with a GPS receiver)."

I thought when charging multiple lipos they all had to be the same mah capacity and have close to the same voltage... But then I found this video...   https://youtu.be/D2H1_tDp7jw
radiocontrol,33h46s,ichelo,3,Wed Apr 22 14:07:32 2015 UTC,"The main problem when you parallel charge different capacity packs is that there is less control over how much current goes into each battery.    Usually when you parallel charge, you add up all of the capacity, decide on the same charge rate, and set that as the current so in this example, using 2c, (1.8 + 1.8 + 1.3 + 1.3) * 2 = 12.4amps.  The problem is that the lower capacity battery packs will rise in voltage faster, so at a given voltage they will be taking less current (which makes sense because over the same charge time they need 500 less mah), so if the 1.8 packs were only rated for a 2c charge rate, they would be being charged too fast.  Another potential problem that you have even if you don't mix capacities is if they are at different charge levels, if you have a battery at 30% and one at 70%, the low one will take an initial charge from the other battery and then will take a larger amount of current through the charge cycle.  In your specific situation your charger is only rated for 6 amps, and those nano-techs are normally rated for a pretty high charge current, so you should be fine, just be careful with charge levels, and keep that in mind for future situations.  I personally like to make sure that the overall charge current doesn't exceed the safe charging current of any of the batteries so that no matter how the current is flowing everything is safe."
radiocontrol,33h46s,syspig,3,Wed Apr 22 14:33:19 2015 UTC,"The problem is that the lower capacity battery packs will rise in voltage faster...   This is false.  Grossly oversimplified, but voltage is like pressure - it will always equalize when packs are connected in parallel."
radiocontrol,33h46s,ichelo,2,Wed Apr 22 19:09:18 2015 UTC,"I did phrase that incorrectly, the voltage will not rise overall, but at a given incoming voltage a pack can taper off on the amount of current that goes into it, and if all of the packs are not charging at the exact same it can be out of balance.  To say that it will split perfectly evenly between the packs according to their size is great in theory, but is a gross oversimplification of the actual situation.  Relative charge rates, internal resistance, differences in resistance in connection, age of pack, etc can all affect how the much current a pack will actually receive compared to what it would in an ideal situation."
radiocontrol,33h46s,Clustertruck,1 point,Wed Apr 22 20:16:49 2015 UTC,"Wrong. The cells are going to consume the power they do and the indicator on the charger will display the sum of the load.

radiocontrol,33h46s,ichelo,2,Wed Apr 22 19:34:01 2015 UTC,"I didn't say that the power was being pushed in, I was saying that with them in parallel you don't have control over how much current goes to each pack which is a function of many factors.  To say that it will split perfectly evenly between the packs according to their size is great in theory, but is an oversimplification of the actual situation which can and will be affected by relative charge rates, internal resistance, differences in resistance in connection, age of pack, etc.  And any of those factors can cause a pack to get a higher relative charge rate than it should in an ideal situation."

The rest I don't disagree with, although mixing packs in these ranges (1-3Ah) is pretty trivial.  I usually charge several identical packs when I do this, for the reasons you point out."
radiocontrol,33h46s,TheCountryOfWat,1 point,Thu Apr 23 03:15:31 2015 UTC,"Just charge them all together at 1300mah, or 1.3 amps. If you never attempt to charge a lipo past its 1C rating then it'll be fine. The 1800s will take longer to charge, but the single charge will be a time saver.  So since you have 4 lipos and a parallel charge board you take the lowest 1C rating of the bunch and multiply it by the number of batteries to charge. In your case 1.3 * 4 = 5.6 amps. It'll probably take about 70-90 minutes to charge all 4."
radiocontrol,33h46s,encaseme,5,Wed Apr 22 14:16:19 2015 UTC,"This is incorrect (though almost correct) - if you're charging in parallel you add the capacities, so if you're charging two 1300 mAh batteries that are rated for 1C charge in parallel, you can put 2.6A into it (each pack will get 1.3A).  If you're charging 1300+1300+1800+1800 (and everything is rated for 1C charge) you can put in 6200 mA (6.2A).  The part you need to pay attention to (and the part where Wat is correct) is the smallest charge ""C""-rating. So, if you have one pack that can charge at 5C, and one that can charge at only 1C, then you need to charge everything in parallel at 1C (for the total combined parallel capacity)."
radiocontrol,33h46s,notamedclosed,1 point,Wed Apr 22 15:27:01 2015 UTC,Will the 1300mah ones stop charging while the 1800mah ones continue charging? Will the 1300 get overcharged?
radiocontrol,33h46s,TheCountryOfWat,2,Wed Apr 22 14:20:25 2015 UTC,"I personally would just do them separately.  However, the reason it works is that the voltage will always stay (roughly) balanced as you charge.  I'm not an electrical engineer so here is my best hack at explaining it.  It takes more energy to charge the 1800 mah battery from 10.5v to 12.5v then the 1300 mah, however because the batteries are in parallel they will always be equalizing with each other.  So all batteries start of at 10.5 (and you need the batteries to be close to the same voltage when you plug them in or bad things will happen because they will equalize with each other). As the charger adds energy to the system the 1300 mah battery will start to have a higher voltage, but volts must always balance (think of it like air pressure, if you had a 2 balloons, one very full of air, the other only partially full and you connected them together you would end up with 2 balloons of the same size/pressure). I'm not actually sure if the energy would flow from the smaller capacity batteries to the larger capacities, or if the 1800 mah batteries would simply absorb more of the energy.    The end result though is that all batteries should stay very close to the same voltage during the charging cycle and finish charging at the same time.  However, the reason I would still do them separately is that you lack control over the individual cells.  For reasons that are beyond my understanding, the whole voltage thing does not equalize perfectly (hence why we have balance plugs on our lipos because even just a single battery can have variances between cells).  Thus, over time you risk having a cell or two start to get out of valid range.  So if you are going to do this then make sure that you individually balance the batteries at regular intervals."
radiocontrol,33h46s,Clustertruck,2,Wed Apr 22 14:47:05 2015 UTC,"This is a very good point, while it may be safe, you do risk damage to the batteries over time due to imperfect balancing."
radiocontrol,33h46s,Clustertruck,1 point,Wed Apr 22 15:07:56 2015 UTC,"Not if you do a finish balancing charge after getting them all up to near capacity. I charge 12 packs at a time this way on two balance boards, and finish the packs on my other two ports (quad charger)."
radiocontrol,33h46s,encaseme,2,Wed Apr 22 19:30:33 2015 UTC,No because on a balance board like that all of the first cells are connected together and the balancr charger is going to stop at 4.2v. Same for 2nd and 3rd cells.  The way I do this is I charge them to 4.15v then split them off one at a time and finish the balance charge on another charger.
radiocontrol,33h46s,Clustertruck,2,Wed Apr 22 19:28:45 2015 UTC,"This isn't exactly the correct way to look at it. When you put the packs in parallel you're essentially just making one single larger pack. You don't have to worry about over-charging one small portion of a cell, it distributes evenly due to chemistry and physics. You can put a tiny tiny 300 mAh pack in parallel with a 5000 mAh pack (assuming both are the same pack-voltage (same number of cells in Series, the ""S"" value)), and charge as if it were a single 5300 mAh pack."
radiocontrol,33h46s,TheCountryOfWat,2,Wed Apr 22 15:28:56 2015 UTC,"Yes. Except a tiny note: its still a balance charge, just that the cells in each pack are bundled so you get the average for cell 1, avg for cell 2... Etc"

radiocontrol,33h46s,xiMbd03u1,1 point,Wed Apr 22 15:46:22 2015 UTC,"They will stop, essentially. They reached capacity and you are not pushing in more than their capacity therefore they will stop progressing. It's more complex than that though.   The balance charging means that if any cell on any battery is lower than it's capacity it is essentially drawing power from other battery cells. They work out their own equilibrium.   I have read that a 200mah spread is safer than a larger difference between battery capacities, but basically if you never push more charge than the lowest capacity battery you will be safe."
radiocontrol,33h46s,xiMbd03u1,3,Wed Apr 22 14:51:49 2015 UTC,"OP, there's a lot of good info posted in this thread and this is exactly how I apply it:   Make sure all batteries I plan to parallel charge are the same cell count, which you said is true at 3S. Make sure they're all within about .3 Volts of each other, which mine usually are since I always land when the alarm goes off. I don't worry too much if they're a little further apart than .3, but that's a risk I accept. Add up the capacities of all packs. Yours sum to 6.2A. If your charger (and the power supply behind it) can push 6.2A, then you can charge at 1C. If your charger can do more, you could do a higher C charge rate. I personally don't charge above 1C since I have lots of different batteries and don't want to bother keeping track of the smallest C rated one.  At 1C, no matter how many batteries are hooked up to my paraboard, mine always takes about 40 minutes to charge. If your charger can't do 6.2A, you can charge at less than 1C and it will just take longer but probably still be faster than multiple charge sessions. I see a lot of advice about lipo charging that I think is misinformed or way excessively careful.  I know a guy who always charges at like .25C which is just silly. I do believe in charging/discharging them to storage voltage if you're not going to touch them for a few days.    There's a lot of info out there that I put in two categories:   How not to create a dangerous situation with your lipos How not to kill your battery causing you to have to buy a new one.   EDIT: I just looked up your Hitec X1 charger and it looks like its a 6Amp charger. You'd have to do a little less than 1C to do all those batteries at once. Like .95C  My personal style of risk management with these batteries is to not create a hazard but toe the line when it comes to creating a paperweight. I know that I'll crash and destroy one of these batteries long before it dies from natural causes. I don't try to make them last forever. I want to charge quickly and get back to flying."

radiocontrol,33h46s,Hblife,5,Wed Apr 22 21:38:23 2015 UTC,"I can't tell for sure from the photo, but it looks like they are not the same S rating. If so, you cannot charge them at the same time, unless you have two separate chargers. You can combine any mAh of battery as long as they are the same voltage, but you cannot combine different voltage packs.  The reason for this is that voltages in parallel seek to equalize, so if you plug a 5S pack in parallel with a 4S pack, current will flow between them until the voltages equalize. This will over-charge the 4S and over-discharge the 5S... assuming the fire from the 4S doesn't destroy the whole setup first.  All of the batteries in the video you posted are 4S."

A couple of tips, in case you need them:   Pack voltage should be within about 0.3 volts of each other (0.1 volts per cell) when you plug them in, to prevent excessive current flowing between them. When you plug the packs in parallel, their voltages will equalize, and this can result in excessive current if their voltages are too far off from each other. The higher-voltage battery will be fine, since these batteries have very high discharge ratings, but the lower-voltage battery may be charged up (from the higher-voltage battery) at an excessive rate. Always plug in all of the main discharge leads to the parallel board first, then plug in the balance connectors second. This will allow the equalization current to flow over the heavier discharge leads. When you charge in parallel, the batteries act like one big battery, with a total capacity the sum of their individual capacities. So if you charge 2x 1300 mAh and 2x 1800 mAh, the total capacity of the parallel system is 6,200 mAh. This means that you can charge at a higher rate than if you were charging the batteries individually. If you were intending to charge at a 1C rate, you could charge the parallel system at up to 6.2 amps. If you have a 50 watt charger that will only push out 4.5 to 5 amps at 3S voltage, the effect is that you are charging at a lower C rating, which is better for your batteries. The reason for this is that the current is divided between the batteries."

radiocontrol,33jncc,KERBAL_BASS,1 point,Thu Apr 23 01:30:28 2015 UTC,"This sounds like an awesome project! Here is a calculator that I found after a quick search (""hovercraft lift fan calculator"" in Google). One thing to be aware of when using a calculator such as this is that fluid dynamics does not scale well. What this means is that a model that works for estimating airflow of a normal scale device may not be valid for a device at a smaller scale.  You mention you will be using a micro-controller so I assume you will want to do some control of the lift and directional control to improve stability. I have given this some thought in the past and I think a good approach would be getting a large volume of air equally distributed into the skirt of craft. You will need to determine the best propeller, fan duct, and fan exhaust that will give stable control. Skirt design and construction will play an important part in obtaining stable control. A good place to start may be reading up on the designs of the USN LCAC and other successful hover crafts.  That said, I have seen several videos on youtube of thrown together RC hovercraft which work great. If you use a big enough motor and aggressive enough propeller as the lift fan, your hovercraft will go somewhere. Sometimes you just have to try something to see if it works. Good luck!"

I'd also highly recommend looking up plenum chambers if you haven't already incorporated that into your design.  another shopping technique i have employed is to find how much I want to spend on a lift motor, then make an index of all the different variety of fans I can afford and their air volume & pressure.  pick the best looking combo and hope it works.  Even underpowering your lift motor won't be too big a deal as long as it can get some air pushed out under the skirt.  Bag skirts are great for that.  the craft will move, just with more contact between ground and skirt which will make it slower and wear out over time.  one of my first hovercrafts was lifted by a server fan and the skirt was a garbage bag.  the skirt got some holes in after a while but was surprisingly durable."

radiocontrol,33hspd,Kimmykix,6,Wed Apr 22 17:05:43 2015 UTC,You've got the right idea holding off trying to flying that right away.    Look for a local RC aircraft club.  Depending where you live there is often an association worth joining which can have benefits like insurance.  At a club you will find people with the knowledge to help get your plane running right again.  You can also find someone to instruct you with a buddy box (their controller is the master so they can take control if you are losing it).
radiocontrol,33hspd,notamedclosed,1 point,Wed Apr 22 17:12:06 2015 UTC,"Luckily i know of a local RC flying field that I used to live near and ride my bike to to watch the planes, I talked with them once and they are really nice people, the only problem being that i live a good hour and a half away from there now, so its a bit of a drive. Nice to know about that Buddy Box thing, that seems like it would be amazingly helpful. Hope someone there has something like that. I'll have to take a trip down there one weekend soon."
radiocontrol,33hspd,figuren9ne,1 point,Wed Apr 22 18:01:51 2015 UTC,"If you're in the USA, do a search on the AMA website to see if any fields exist closer to your area. You'll want to avoid park flyer fields, not because they're bad, but because they won't be able to help you much with a glo/gasoline power plane as park flyer fields are limited to electric and unpowered planes. Like the previous poster said, most clubs have some sort of high wing .40 sizes glo trainer with a buddy box to get you experienced flying. If you have RC simulator experience, you'll get the hang of it quickly.   I'll be completely honest, most of the stuff in that plane is probably salvageable and useable but I wouldn't use it. It's a beautiful vintage plane and you don't want to wreck it because a servo failed. I'd save this plane for the future when you're more skilled and give it a modern rebuild with new electronics and maybe even convert it to electric. Your uncle will get a kick out of watching it fly with modern hardware in it and you'll have a cool vintage plane that works reliably for years to come.   Go to a field, see what people are flying. Maybe you want to go with glo power like your uncles plane, or you may want to go electric. You'll be able to see examples of both types flying at many fields and it may get your dad even more interested in the hobby and help finance a new, beginner plane for the both of you to learn on. Someone may even sell you a plane or electronics to get you started more cheaply."

It's a top of the line aircraft and you will crash while learning to fly, no matter what the plane, so learn on something not so valuable.  The radio is the most expensive part (followed by the motor). The good news is that planes are cheap, and the more time you have, the cheaper they are). I never had any money either, but I did have a relative who was into model aircraft, and so I did have a nice radio. The planes only cost a few dollars in balsa wood. Today it's more common to build out of foam board. Go to http://www.flitetest.com for free plans. Take the hardware off the CE and use that saving the plane until you are a better pilot.

As for the plane, it's RARE, my dad has the Byron S-1,  I flew it and it was a handful to fly. It's heavy, with a high wing loading.

You will also benefit for the knowledge of other experienced pilots to get your setup running safely and properly.  As for the Christian Eagle, it is an advanced, unstable aerobatics biplane.  The fuel system will need to be re-plumbed, all batteries replaced and engine gone over but I wouldn't say the servos need to be replaced as long as they are functioning properly.  If you are serious about getting into the hobby make an investment into a good 2.4 ghz radio system (futaba, JR, spektrum, Hitec, ect).  What no one has touched on is the second airframe that you were gifted.  It looks to possibly be a Goldberg Eagle or Eagle 2 high wing .40 sized glow powered trainer.

I also had some deans stuff laying around that I wanted to convert to xt-60 and I've always had a hard time soldering. I was trying to get by with the cheapest equipment (30watt soldering iron, no heat gun for heatshrink, i'd just use candles, etc..), so last week I got a good 60watt iron, a hobbyking 1500 watt heat gun, and flux. The new iron melts the solder quickly before the wire and connector get too hot, the flux sucks the solder into the connector quickly without leaving bits of solder everywhere, and the heat gun shrinks the shrinkwrap nice and quickly. I was up very late last night converting the last of my stuff over to xt-60 and several of the connections looked near professional quality.  In the past I've used EC3 which were nice that the connectors are easy to solder and then pop into the housing, but I was worried that since they popped in, with enough force they could pop out and touch each other and cause a short.

Since each aircraft flies different, a lot of flying is figuring out how each aircraft handles.  Some guy showed up at my AMA field and wanted to see his aircraft flown.  He crashed his stryker since he was new and all he wanted to see was the plane in the air.  I was able to fly it alright but I wasn't comfortable with it."

I also upgraded the firmware on the Taranis to OpenTX, it allows you to use it as a USB joystick.  Real flight or Phoenix might look better or have better simulation of real world effects on a airplane, but it will never be exactly like flying a real airplane. Remember, the main goal of using a sim (for beginners) is training yourself to correctly react to how the plane is flying, no matter the orientation. For instance, if the plane is flying toward you, which way do you move the stick to roll the plane left? You shouldn't have to think about, you should just do it correctly because of muscle memory. That way when you are flying a real plane you reduce the likelihood of crashing a plane due to pilot error."

Realflight releases aircraft in ""mega"" packs (which you have to pay for), but the newest version includes either an airplane pack or a helicopter pack, which denotes what you end up with more of. It's possible your friend just opted for the airplane mega-pack.  There's also a pretty big community and swap file system with Realflight, which has a huge amount of user-created resources available.

What I really dislike about Realflight is it just seems like a cash grab, add-on DLC is a huge problem where as Phoenix lets the users create their own planes and helis plus even offers them for download. Also the copy protection is really a pain for RealFlight if you want to use your own TX, I have mine plugged in tot he back of my laptop, after a few times when you crash you need to press a button on the dongle to reauthenicate, it's annoying.  So those are the two main commercial ones, you might want start with RC DeskPilot it's totally free and very good considering that it was made by a guy in his free time.    Leo's RC Simulator is also good, also free and there is an Android version as well.   Besides those there are also more niche sims around like heli-x, Clearview, Aerosim RC, Accu-rc,  neXt Flight Sim and likely a few more that I don't know about as well."

radiocontrol,32xhxo,Silverhold,4,Fri Apr 17 15:09:47 2015 UTC,"Dude that's a steal!!!! Wish i was that lucky. I've had a few E-MAXXs over the couple years and it's by far my favorite truck. I've never run them brushless. I like the controllable low end torque of brushed motors, But if you wanted to go brushless you'd just need a motor and ECS. When you start running higher cell count LIPOs is when you have diff issues. Honestly as it sits you could probably slap some fresh packs in there and run it for a while!"
radiocontrol,32xhxo,MaxeMouse,2,Fri Apr 17 15:24:00 2015 UTC,"I might do that. I was considering getting some cheap HobbyKing brushless motors and running them in there. I had good fun doing that with a couple on-road vehicles. I've never experienced a dual motor setup before though. I take it you need a special ESC to run dual motors and servos?  Plus, I got two E-Maxx trucks so I kind of want to convert one to brushless and that way I'll still have the other brushed to use if I want."
radiocontrol,32xhxo,MaxeMouse,2,Fri Apr 17 15:30:47 2015 UTC,"Sounds like a plan! A little on the dual motors.  Traxxas supplies those trucks with the EVX 2 speed controller. It is one of VERY FEW, maybe even no, dual motor speed controllers on the market. Upon closer inspection you'll notice there are 2 battery inputs and two pairs of motor outputs. Everything for power is controlled in that one box. The E-MAXX is a torque MONSTER. With good batteries it will stand wheelies no problem.  On the cons side it is quite heavy. I've got an original E-MAXX (3906) and it has only a single steering servo and without an expensive high torque servo the steering is quite sluggish. Traxxas' fix for this was to install 2 steering servos on a Y adaptor so they run off a single input from the receiver. You can run 2 25 dollar servos and get the same performace I get from 1 100 dollar servo.  Hobbyking is a great place to start for budget Brushless systems. Do some searching and you'll find countless people running brushless, but you'll get a lot of stories about stripped differentials. It's to be expected. Its a basher monster truck. If you're doing wheels stands and stoppies with a vehicle that can do 60-70 MPH, you're gonna break stuff. A little self control goes a long way."
radiocontrol,32xhxo,MaxeMouse,1 point,Fri Apr 17 15:50:46 2015 UTC,"Interesting. It looks like people tend to convert to a single brushless motor set up. Would I need to convert over to a single servo on that as well?   If I went the hobbyking route, is there anything particular I should be paying attention to ESC or motor wise? The E-Maxx is considered 1/8th scale, right?"
radiocontrol,32xhxo,MaxeMouse,2,Fri Apr 17 17:23:40 2015 UTC,Most motors and ESC;s are sold as pairs. If you piece it together yourself make sure you match the power comsimption of the motor to ESC and batteries. If the motor pulls 100 Amps max you want a speed controller that can handle that and a battery(s) that can supply it.

For example my ORX T-6 ""DX6 clone"" you use Positive expo to slow the input.  As for reasons? Going to use my radio for this. I would use positive expo on a very small twitchy plane to smooth it out. Or I would use negative expo to increase the rate of input for a 3D plane.  Sorry for the terrible examples, hope this helps."

But just because I can't think of something, that doesn't mean nobody can ...  And had the feature been disabled by the radio manufacturer, then even if somebody did have a use for it -- they wouldn't be able to do it.  It's kind of like this old Unix quote/joke --   ""Unix gives you just enough rope to hang yourself -- and then a couple of more feet, just to be sure.''     -- Eric Allman  ... ""We make rope.""  -- Rob Gingell on Sun Microsystem's new virtual memory.   If you stop people from doing stupid things, you also stop them from doing clever things.

I have bashed my walls so many times xD The bullet blades instantly shatter but the normal ones are still uncracked! Any tips for fixing any stock problems?"
radiocontrol,32q8ia,Micubano,1 point,Fri Apr 17 13:32:58 2015 UTC,"Mine were fine when they were stock. On thing I learned fast was hitting the throttle hold the moment I realized it was going to crash. It really minimizes the damage. After 4 years, it is just instinct now. Sometimes I will be flying a plane and have a close call. When I am done flying I notice I hit the TH switch I use for helis.   Keep an eye on your blade tracking at 0 pitch to make sure the feathering shaft in the head is not bent. If one blade looks higher than the other while they are spinning, then you may want to take the feathering shaft out and roll it on a table to see if it is still straight. I went through a couple of them early on. The plastic swash arm sometimes crack but do not break and you will not see it. It will affect the flight, so inspect them closely. Make sure that hair is not getting stuck in the head, around the shaft, or in the motors. I have dogs so that happens a lot. Do not try and burn the hair off. I know one guy who tried that and needed to replace the head. If you have any 3 in 1 or bearing oil, you can put a little where the swash moves on the main shaft and by the bearings. That helps with vibrations a little. Landing gear can be hot glued or CA'd, but I bought the AirTimeRC low profile set and they are unbreakable. If you are not using the 45c batteries, pick one or two up. It makes a huge difference in power. And finally, you never know when the motors are going to go but if you take 10 to 15 minute breaks between flights to let them cool down they will last longer. The brushless upgrade is worth it because they last a long time compared to brushed and have more power. The one from Blade is really easy to install.  Once you have a handle on the NCPX, everything bigger will seem easy to fly. I would skip anything else with a direct drive (separate tail motor) and go to something with a torque tube like the 130x or 180 cfx. A lot of people hate the 130x. It took me about 10 flights before I had my first one tuned (oil the torque tube to stop the crazy vibrations), but both of mine still fly great. The 180 CFX is so much easier to work on and fly, but immediately replace the torque tube with an after market one that has metal ends. The stock ones break real easily."

radiocontrol,32k94d,ThrowinStacks,2,Tue Apr 14 17:33:38 2015 UTC,I've actually done this a few times. Trick is if the main car battery is only just flat to connect a 4cell lipo for a few minutes. This will raise the voltage of the main battery enough to crank over. You can use a wattmeter to monitor amperes and transfer stats etc.   Not a great idea to crank with a lipo attached unless you have real high current wiring and connectors.

The Blade is great for the price if you can get one of the older models. I've seen the Q500 price dropping because a new model is coming out soon and the discontinued the original one. If you can pick up any quad with a gimbal, do it. Going from the flat mounted 350 QX to a 350 QX2 AP with the GoPro gimbal made a huge difference in video quality. I sold the QX2 and upgraded to the Q500 to be able to tilt the camera in flight.

It's also closed source.   I will put this bluntly, 3DR lie, a lot. Seems that we are talking about multiple processors, they have done that before and claimed the APM, based on a tired 8 bit Ardunio, was triple core. Really, you will find some of it here.  3DR is one of those companies that always claims to be ""the world's first"" in everything, they simply aren't at anything. Anderson got caught stealing stuff from Wikipedia for a book and in a huge ironic twist of fate it was about how things should be free, doubly ironic now they are going closed source."

Before that the Paparazzi project was raped in a big way for fixed wing code and implementations, all been white washed now and thrown down the memory hole. Of course how else could you claim to have invented everything if people knew you took it from everyone else.   PixHawk also forked Openpilot in the past as well, it's honest a shame projects like Paparazzi and Openpilot don't do any marketing, those projects really got us where we are today along with MultiWii of course. 3DR is all about money and marketing."

This guy on Twitter is worth following, he trolls them but has a sense of humor with it:   https://twitter.com/diydronesafety  He leaked the solo a few days ago, showed a video of it as well, he is exposing all paid for articles and marketing now. It seems very underwhelming, that is the danger in how 3DR are acting, they do nothing new, they are purely hanging on to coat tails. There is a famous quote by Jordi, one of the founders of 3DR in a moment of candor admitted he stole everything.   3DR have not made any innovations, so what? Many companies don't, I do not see the desire for them to try to be remembered that way, focus on it being Open Source or something that is real.   Edit: They also have some disclaimer where if it flies away you get a new one, shame they didn't have that last year when mine flew off and they did everything they could to deny it was their issue, turns out it was a software bug."
radiocontrol,32huh5,The_Rob_White,2,Tue Apr 14 04:21:41 2015 UTC,"A lot of the stuff diydronesafety RTs or claims as 3DR failures is people using hobbyist kit aimed at people who give a shit about setting things up right when they simply don't. There was one guy a month or so ago who was screaming till he was blue in the face (okay, via email/github, but hey) about how the RC failsafe (which he hadn't configured) didn't save his craft when his RC set lost signal (because the copter hadn't been set up with a RC failsafe, so how could it?). Some people just shouldn't be buying and flying 3DR's hobbyist kit - it's advanced, it's complex, it needs understanding and using properly. Solo should let people do the advanced stuff DJI kit won't let you do without having to do all that. So that's a plus in my book.  3DR do make good parts for hobbyists. They support open source, which helps the wider community. I don't think I'll be buying a Solo but I wouldn't buy a Phantom either - I enjoy the nuts and bolts too much to go RTF. I'd happily recommend a Solo to people, though, much as I'd recommend a Phantom. It's all new options.  Marketing - well, most of the time how good the marketing is has nothing to do with how good the product is. I don't really give a fuck, so long as the hardware and software is good. If people really want to bitch about it all, that's their right, but it'd be nice to see some of these people doing something productive instead, to help the community."
radiocontrol,32huh5,ixforres,1 point,Tue Apr 14 19:29:37 2015 UTC,"I think the blame the user culture needs to really vanish, this was a major issue I had with my 3DR gear, their support tried to do the same thing to me, when it was in fact a software issue that they even knew about. I have seen them do the same pattern consistently, blame the user or blame things being open source even.    Sure you will get the odd idiot but this is the exception and not the rule. 3DR has a bad reputation and it earned it all by it's self. It also has a very bad reputation for flying poorly and it certainly does, again it was well earned.   3DR claim their items are an RTF, are sold as such and tout any idiot could use them, yet you say they are hobbyist grade, I'd agree, they however push them very differently. If there was more honesty, that they are hobby grade only, then there would be far less issues, they bring it on themselves with their famous over sell tactics. The Solo will yet again end in tears with flyaways, people getting hurt and feeling like they have been conned. Just watch, it's not a hard prediction as the IRIS+ was marketed the same way.   They support open source, which helps the wider community   With most things you say, I have little issue with, I have had difference experiences than you and that is fine, this however is double speak straight from Orwell.   3DR took orders of magnitude more from the Open Source community than they have ever given, this is not even contentious and is well understood. I can not think of even one thing they originated, there are many things they claim to have, but as always with 3DR it's dishonest. Additionally Open Source survives on credit, 3DR are notoriously parasitic and deny credit as a rule.       There was however, one spot of honesty in their past, the co-founder of 3DR admitted he stole everything and yes, the word he used was stole. Right from the horses mouth.  I think it is productive what people like DIYDroneSaftey do, it makes it far harder for 3DR to cover things up, it sets realistic expectation for people and most importantly it makes them less trusting of the used car sales tactics employed by 3DR.   Critical thinking and skepticism is something that is missing from a lot of people minds, having a personality to counter to the spin matters, besides that he's also very funny.  After all that, I am buying a Solo, it has a nice 30 day free loan period, I'll fly it make up my own mind and then likely take them up on their offer and return it."
radiocontrol,32huh5,The_Rob_White,2,Tue Apr 14 23:54:29 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure you really understand open source. I work on a multitude of open source projects. Stuff gets forked, incorporated into products, often uncredited, all the time. I know for sure that hundreds of pro audio codecs out there have code I wrote under the hood, and I'm fine with that. Even more so because quite a lot of the vendors using it fed code back to me and shared it, even though they had no obligation to.  Solo is the first real RTF consumer drone that 3DR have sold. IRIS and co were always targeted at the prosumer market, more like an S900 or similar than an Inspire. It'll be interesting to see how it goes. As for flyaways or people being injured, frankly drones are not safe. DJI stuff does fall out of the sky too, DJI stuff flies away too (only last week I was helping someone debug an A2 which was repeatedly trying to head for the hills). Shit happens to everyone. Robustness is important, but users will always be able to make stuff fail in interesting ways in this market."
radiocontrol,32huh5,Krussia,0,Wed Apr 15 17:13:57 2015 UTC,"Either you are grossly uninformed or trying to rewrite history just as 3DR keep doing, it's dishonest.    Solo is the first real RTF consumer drone that 3DR have sold   Oh really? IRIS+ in Best buy. What do you say to that? Just an accident?  IRIS+ was sold as a Phantom competitor (the word killer was used to me), I was told this directly by 3DR, they claimed to me it was better than the Phantom, easier to use and safer, it isn't, not even close. I have no love for DJI, I find their products boring and over priced, but they handle things with more honesty than 3DR are capable of and they can innovate, you dodged my question about what 3DR have ever done that is new, or simply ignored it as the answer is nothing.  I am not really sure you understand Open Source and sorry I not believe your claims, same as your ones about IRIS+ not being sold to consumers.  There is the right way to act in the community spirit. Please research Tivoization, that stays within the license technical but it is scummy and the GPLv3 was designed in part to address it, if you are unaware that is exactly what 3DR did to work from other people.   It's douchbaggery 1st class. Yet you claim they help the Open Source community? See now that is where I take offence and find that marketing so insidious, I have seen Anderson spew that crap often. Then use DRM to lock down the work of others, that is helping the community? A community that widely flat out rejects DRM.   3DR are parasitic, always have been and always will be, DRM is the proof of that. Going closed source with the Solo hardware is yet another example.    Are you even aware of Makerbot? I suggest you look that issue with them and the fact the co-founder (Zachary Smith) even came out against them.   Now if you look further, you will find two things. 1. The VC firm behind Makerbot is also a lead one behind 3DR, they are pulling the same tricks, not a surprise. 2. Anderson himself came out and stated they are adopting the Makerbot model, yet again from the horses mouth. Yuck.  So if you support Open Source, 3DR are certainly not the company to get behind or defend, their claims that you parroted that they support the wider community are busted, their actions betray your and their words.  I'll just leave this here:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFWwvUpth7w  A guy had to stand on the Solo to prevent a fly away. Same old 3DR, currently they are trying to suppress that video, it already got removed from their Facebook. Censorship is also a key trait of the Open Source community as well now? I don't think so.   I have a quote for you, you have a choice to make yourself: ""When people who are honestly mistaken learn the truth, they will either cease being mistaken, or cease being honest"".  I suspect you will continue to pick the 2nd option sadly."

The wash from the tail rotor and reduced lift from the vortex created against the ground is the cause. Totally normal.  7 minutes sounds pretty normal for flight time.  BASICALLY, a flybar controls pitch of the rotor deck. It also acts as an automatic stabilization method for fixed pitch flight. A flybar with Fixed pitch has no automatic leveling( more or less). If flybarless and fixed pitch, your bird will need a gyro to auto level. If flybarless and collective pitch. You'll need a gyro to auto level."

Here is a picture of my hand out the window pressing a button on my remote control, notice the bright infrared light...  However, I learned from searching that some homes have ""low-E"" windows that block/reflect IR light, so it does depend on your windows. These seem to have popped up in the mid-00's, at a higher price of course, so if you're in the small minority of homes which have those windows, you won't have this problem with infrared R/C copters...  The original statement ""glass reflects IR"" is misleading at best. The low-E windows are glass with a coating (and in some cases, double-paned with argon gas in the middle) and that's what highly reflects the IR. From what I can find, normal glass and other things which I would consider ""types of glass"" such as tempered and frosted, do not block IR any more than they block natural light."

radiocontrol,32672k,diabetic_debate,2,Fri Apr 17 04:45:43 2015 UTC,How do you like flying with the floats?
radiocontrol,32672k,Pete3,1 point,Sat Apr 11 02:53:01 2015 UTC,"It's a bit strange, honestly. It makes the airplane act like a pendulum, plus if you put the flaps down with the floats on it it does some seriously strange stuff. With this aircraft on floats, I have noticed it likes to stay shiny side up or it has really weird behavior. Inverted flight is miserable, and it struggles to do full aileron rolls without some sort of weird change in pitch attitude.   I get around these issues by simply not doing aerobatics with this airplane when it is on floats.   However, I have other float aircraft and they fly beautifully with them. I think this plane is just a tad too light to be rock-solid with floats on it, though.   Edit: I was able to set up the aircraft to fly well with floats by doing a few things - I have a Spektrum DX8 and I mixed the flap channel so that it goes in stages roughly equivalent to 0 degrees, 20 degrees, and 40 degrees. I added in a 2 second delay so that the flaps don't just pop down, they come down slowly - this was a big part of the problem as the sudden change in wing chord line used to make the aircraft pitch up wildly. Another thing to note is that you do not need flaps for takeoff at all. This aircraft will happily fly of just about any surface flaps up. However, you can use about half flaps (roughly 20 degrees) to take off in a very short distance if you don't take off at full throttle. Flaps are very useful for landing, though, as they are quite effective at making the plane fly well at slow speeds - just make sure you slow the airplane down before you deploy the flaps or it will balloon and pitch up hard. When fully deployed and holding 25-40% throttle for the approach, the plane scoots along at a brisk walking pace and will basically float calmly all the way to the surface with floats or wheels. Carry throttle until the moment you touch down and be sure to flare before touchdown or the aircraft bounces on wheels. However, don't use the flaps in gusty or windy conditions - one good gust will cause it to balloon and stall and pancake down on the ground. You don't want to be flying that close to your stall speed in gusty wind as a gust will give you extra lift and then when the gust passes, you will lose all your airspeed and lift and make friends with the ground real fast. Flaps on this airplane are pretty much exclusively for calm days.   Finally, avoid unusual attitudes with the floats attached. Keep it to 45 degrees of bank or less and the same for pitch and you'll be fine."
radiocontrol,32672k,Pete3,2,Sat Apr 11 07:47:13 2015 UTC,"Good to know. Always loved the beaver, iconic plane living in north west Canada.  I think I need one, but may look at other options if it doesn't fly to well with the floats. Thanks for the reply"
radiocontrol,32672k,Airwarf,2,Sat Apr 11 13:11:04 2015 UTC,"I've got this beaver and it flies fantastically. Plus, it has lots of power and nice scale details like landing and nav lights as well as flaps and water rudders so you can steer the plane on the surface. Doesn't have any of the weird behavior that the cub does and is much more forgiving when it comes to deploying the flaps while flying too fast, but I would still only use flaps at low airspeeds and they aren't really necessary for take-off.   also, I repainted mine in a Harbour Air Livery."
radiocontrol,327tl4,dontbreaththis,2,Sat Apr 11 09:46:45 2015 UTC,"My understanding is that a car motor would overheat trying to push the prop once it starts to hit a wall of top speed.

radiocontrol,328rr3,remotaholic,1 point,Sat Apr 11 18:50:58 2015 UTC,"No particular reasons that I know of.  Most people go for a 9X because it's only $10 more, but in your case with shipping if the price difference is too big, I can see how an i6 could be alright.  If the 9X exists in the UK warehouse (and is just out of stock), unless I needed a tx asap, I would just backorder it or sign-up for stock alerts and wait it out for around a month. The 9X is so highly recommended that it's probably worth the wait in one way or another.  If it doesn't exist in the UK warehouse and I didn't want to spend the extra money, I'd probably just go with an i6. (just check reviews and youtube videos first to see what people complain about)  Another option is that HK shipping usually goes in 1kg increments, so if you're at say, 500g, you can add another 500g of cheap propellers or other gear that doesn't exist in the Uk warehouse to offset some of the additional shipping cost. If you have friends that fly, offering to split shipping on some int. warehouse stuff that they wanted could work too."

radiocontrol,325u3z,TheKorzik,2,Fri Apr 10 21:18:41 2015 UTC,"There are 2 black dots on the bottom that show where the CoG is supposed to be.  The dots are are about 30% from the leading edge.  I hope that is correct.  When the battery is in, it mostly balances there, and I can adjust a little pushing the battery forward.  I was really worried about fixing the wing into one location with hot glue, but thought I'd try it out instead of using skewers and rubber bands.  Anybody have a good link about dealing with CoG?  I've read and watched many things from Youtube and rcgroups, but always looking for more information!"
radiocontrol,325u3z,dougmc,5,Fri Apr 10 21:23:02 2015 UTC,"Skewers and rubber bands may look bad, but they're very strong and yet if the plane does crash they give and often can spare the plane some damage.  They're also easy to adjust.  They're good for initial attempts at a design, and once you get everything right you might want to try something else more solid to mount the wing.  As for the center of gravity, it sounds like you already know what you need to know about that, but I'll add that the further forward it is the more stable the plane is, but the more up elevator it requires for level flight, and the further back it is the less stable the plane will be and the less up elevator it'll need.  There is no ""perfect for all things"" setting, but further back generally give you higher performance and further forward makes planes easier to fly.  More than 35% back often results in a plane that cannot be kept under control and a crash is very likely -- better to be too far forward than too far back, though if it's too far forward the plane may not have enough elevator control authority to keep the nose up and so it won't fly at all."

I did it and had the wing separate from the fuselage while flying. You can however remove some the tape and paper to expose the foam and hot glue the foam surfaces together. I found that the glue gets a better hold on the foam. I think the tape is too smooth for good adhesion."

radiocontrol,325u3z,GoodFortuneHand,3,Sat Apr 11 01:59:30 2015 UTC,"30% should give a good conservative CG to start with.  For future reference, keep in mind that any weight you add in the tail generally means adding 3 times as much in the nose to balance out (or making the nose very long).  For future light weight designs, considering moving the tail servos forward.  It looks like you could easily mount the elevator servo on the bottom of the fuselage, near the trailing edge of the wing, for example."

radiocontrol,326t0t,sunfishtommy,3,Sat Apr 11 01:54:42 2015 UTC,"Yes. DSM2 and DSMX are the protocols that the DX8 supports, so anything which is DSM2 or DSMX compatible will work.  Basically any bind-n-fly aircraft from Horizon Hobby's empire (Blade helis, E-Flite and HobbyZone planes, etc), official Spektrum receivers of course, and unofficial DSM2/DSMX things such as OrangeRX or LemonRX."

Also follow up question could you give me a brief summary of satellite receivers.    I understand they serve as a backup to your main receiver, but I don't really understand, and I don't understand how they work."
radiocontrol,326t0t,kwaaaaaaaaa,4,Sat Apr 11 02:47:05 2015 UTC,"Satellite receivers allow for path diversity and signal polarization. Essentially, it's just another receiver connected to the main receiver and it selects the better signal of the two.   When you fly large aircrafts, you're limited to where you can mount a single receiver. If you happen to bank the plane, the fuselage can essentially block out the receiver. Another reason is the polarization issue. Higher frequencies matter more that the antennas are parallel to each other for best reception. So if your craft banks a turn, it can put the antenna in a perpendicular plane. A satellite receiver can be installed 90 degree from the receiver antenna to allow for more angles of orientation."

radiocontrol,3250r0,exocaged,3,Fri Apr 10 17:12:02 2015 UTC,How big is your bank account? LoL. Scalerfab makes some of the best bumpers and sliders around. You will need aluminum links as the stock ones will bend easily. Be careful of the front axle hooking rocks as the servo gears are weak. Also don't bounce it on the throttle too much or you will strip the idler gear in the transmission.

I was only ordering those parts to get a better approach angle."
radiocontrol,3250r0,exocaged,3,Fri Apr 10 18:51:14 2015 UTC,The things I listed are normal issues with these trucks. When you bind it up you will see. The nice thing is the idler gear is RRP 1541 and if you can fab up things you can make your own links.

radiocontrol,322rk7,TheAverageKerbal,1 point,Fri Apr 10 21:20:30 2015 UTC,"I doubt the new DX6 has anything built in, but if you simply want to apply some differential thrust to your engines from the rudder channel, you could do it in the plane with one of these or something similar.  (Any sort of V-tail, delta-wing, or elevon mixer would work -- they all do the same thing.)  It's not a perfect solution, but it'll work fairly well, especially if you make the differential between the two ESCs small.  Your inputs to the mixer would be the throttle and the rudder (or another channel), and the outputs would be the two ESCs for your motors.  On your TX, if you don't have a rudder on the plane you just adjust the endpoints on your rudder (to adjust how much effect the rudder has on the throttles) and you're done.  If you do have a rudder, you'd mix the rudder into ch5 or ch6 and then adjust the endpoints on that channel (and that channel would be the one that goes into the mixer in the plane.)  This should work with your DX6i, and really, you could even make it work with a four channel TX if you didn't need to be able to adjust the strength of the rudder and differential thrust independently.  Now, if you want a separate analog control for the differential than the rudder, so you can adjust it completely independently from the rudder, then the DX6i won't do it, and neither will the DX7 or the new DX6 -- you'll need something with another slider or knob.  (Unless of course you can give up your aileron channel for that!)  If you do decide to do this, make sure you set things up with the props off -- that's good advice with any new plane, but in this case there's a lot more places to get confused about what does what and so it's harder to get things setup properly, and since the throttle is involved ... it pays to not put the props on until everything is right even more than usual."
radiocontrol,322rk7,dougmc,1 point,Fri Apr 10 06:48:12 2015 UTC,I have an idea of how to do it by using mixes in the transmitter. The only issue is that the dx6i is flawed and won't let you use the throttle as a slave.   That's why I was curious if the issue was resolved in the DX6
radiocontrol,322rk7,dougmc,1 point,Fri Apr 10 19:13:48 2015 UTC,"Yes, I've heard that the DX6i is flawed in that respect.  But you can still do it there -- just get the $3 mixer I pointed out.

radiocontrol,31vyge,xiMbd03u1,4,Wed Apr 8 19:49:15 2015 UTC,"Orientation with fixed-wing is not too difficult with some practice.   If the plane is in profile (i.e. flying left or right relative to you)  The plane is always flying forwards, right? Okay. So you always know which way it is pointing. Pitch always works the same regardless of orientation, so that's no problem. So the only challenge is which way the plane is rolled. First, you should be able to see from profile whether the plane is level, or whether it has a wing tipped up/down. If the plane is level and you know which way it is pointing, then knowing which way to turn it is easy. The only real challenge comes in when the plane is far away, and you can see that a wing is dipped, but you don't know if it is turning towards you or away from you.   Step 1: Don't panic.  Step 2: Maintain altitude. Whether the plane is flying away from you or towards you, as long as you maintain altitude, you're not going to crash.  Step 3: Make a guess as to which way the plane is tilted, and push the aileron stick gently in the direction that you want the plane to roll. One of two things will happen. Either the plane's profile will change so that the wing looks more dipped, or the profile will change so that the plane looks more leveled-out. Now you know which way the plane is tilted. For example, if you push the aileron stick to the left, and the wing dips further, then the plane was already banked to the left. If you push the aileron stick to the left, and the plane levels out, then the plane was banked to the right. Now that you know the plane's attitude, you can input controls to make it do what you want.  If the plane is flying directly towards/away from you  Maybe the plane is so far away that it's hard to tell if it's pointing towards you or not.   Step 1: Don't panic.  Step 2: Maintain altitude.  Step 3: Gently input a little bit of aileron. If the plane turns in that direction, it's flying away from you. If it turns the opposite direction, it's flying towards you.  Ultimately, maintaining orientation is NOT a visual thing as much as it is a mental thing. Visual cues will help, but under most normal circumstances, you should be able to fly a perfectly black sphere, in theory."

radiocontrol,31vyge,Hystus,1 point,Wed Apr 8 23:06:01 2015 UTC,"I would suggest making the left wing and tail one colour, and the right wing another.  So you end up with a ""line"" with two colours (the wings) and a ""blob"" being the tail.  The fuselage tends to become indistinct  at a distance.  Dark and Light are best.  White/Black, bright Yellow/Dark Blue etc., not Green/red.  Colours with the same intensity tend to become indistinct further away.  It's not that you can't tell the difference, it's just that it's more difficult to do at a glance.    Try it.  Put 2 colours on a scrap card and have someone spin it across the room then quickly glance at it.  I think you'll find black/white shows more easily than red/green.  That being said,I looks to be a nice build!   Well done."

You will be in a left hand turn flying away from you when all of a sudden it hits that perfect angle where it now looks like it's coming towards you and turning a different direction. The trick is to stay calm and not cut the throttle or start banging the sticks. Keep focused and visualize what the plane is actually doing and likely orientation will return quickly."

Forward and backwards on the left stick would be forward and backwards (X) on the wheels, left and right on the left stick would send a Y to the front 2 wheels and a -Y to the back 2 wheels.  That would also allow for a center up/down and movement on the left/right of the left stick to spin the vehicle in place.    Right stick(left/right) would just add or subtract mix from whatever Y is currently being sent to all wheels to allow it to stride.    This would also allow for the self centering stick to remain in place.  Letting go of it would stop the vehicle.    So yes, it's possible.  A pretty complex mix, but it's possible I would think.  Neat project btw.    Edit : here is a document on controlling them : http://thinktank.wpi.edu/resources/346/ControllingMecanumDrive.pdf"
radiocontrol,31y4qc,HowInTheHell,2,Thu Apr 9 05:00:07 2015 UTC,Yep. I understood some of those words. Sounds like a cool project. I don't know what transmitters can do that and how to set that up but it seems possible from what I've seen under quick searches about mixing channels. Keep us posted on the project as it comes along. I'd love to make a rover of some sort.

radiocontrol,31y4qc,dusty78,2,Thu Apr 9 23:16:40 2015 UTC,That's mathematically the same as a quadcopter mixing.   All motors work together:  Quad throttle; Mecanum fwd/aft motion Front motors oppose back motors: Quad tilts fore/aft; Mecanum ??? nothing? motors fight each other? Right motors oppose left motors: Quad tilts right/left; Mecanum rotates about Z axis Diagonal motors oppose opposite diagonal:  Quad yaws; Mecanum moves left/right   You can hack out the stabilizing part of the open source quad and just use a quad controller as a mixer; then you'll only need to output 3 channels from the Tx to the robot (leaving the rest for FUN)  You'll also need ESC's that center around 0 (where quads center around 50% throttle)
radiocontrol,31y4qc,dusty78,1 point,Thu Apr 9 15:19:37 2015 UTC,"I build my own ESCs with DRV8833 h-bridge chips and Picaxe microcontrollers (I made RC Lego controllers this way) that zero at 1.5ms servo pulses, which is in the middle of the servo throw, so that's no problem.  I shouldn't need a quad controller though, right?  That's the part I'm confused about.  I'm pretty sure you've got it right, in that I'm going to use conditions 1, 3, and 4, but the difficult thing to get my mind around is that sometimes I'm going to use 3 and 4 at the same time.  Can I make my sticks mix to do that?"

radiocontrol,31v8q7,The_Rob_White,2,Wed Apr 8 19:21:11 2015 UTC,"Not exactly what you asked but as no one has replied yet, I'm using the 8S with Deviation so can comment on the firmware at least: it is great.  I have a Taranis also, but find the Deviation firmware much easier to use. For range on the 8S it's fine, better than Spektrum as it can be power boosted to 150mw, Devo 10 uses the same radio module.  The 9RX however has the module support, this is the sole reason I bought the Taranis, while it's caused you an issue, I missed this a lot with the Devo.   What about another source for the module? They were available on eBay at one point."
radiocontrol,31v8q7,The_Rob_White,1 point,Wed Apr 8 14:26:15 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your detailed reply!  There is one US seller that sells the orange module, but for 38 dollars plus relatively high shipping to germany, plus the usual import tax / duty fees.  I did not know the devo have 150mw modules, that would be another reason to use outdoors.   Thanks for your opinion on the firmware/usability, after my first difficult computer transmitter I really want something easy to use on the field :-)"
radiocontrol,31v8q7,The_Rob_White,2,Wed Apr 8 18:09:52 2015 UTC,"The Devo as well as the Spektrum stuff uses the Cypress ProC wireless chipset, so in theory they can both run at 150mw output, however the Spektrum guys limit theirs in software to output a max of 100mw (to stay legal). The Cypress stuff is also used by a few other people as well.  Thanks to the Open Source nature of Deviationtx, you can configure it to run at the full 150mw power output if you like, it's an option in the bind menu (I think it's there, but it's obvious and easy to find).  The output is very configurable, I tend to turn it down to 50mw for indoor stuff.   I love my Taranis but it's main use is with racing multis because I use an LRS with most of those, the programming however is complex. This is not a criticism; it's simply as OpenTX is really powerful and high configurable, still the Devo 8S is my go to for anything that doesn't need an LRS.   I like that deviationtx has a simple mode as well as an advanced mode, but here's the Devo 10 manual:   http://www.deviationtx.com/user-manual?download=11:deviation10usermanual  It shows the screens, I have zero issue using deviation at the field to make changes, it's no harder than the stock software or the software from Spektrum.  I wonder what is going on the with Orange stuff, might not be anything serious but not allowing back orders is weird, maybe nothing more than they have something new soon to be released."
radiocontrol,31v8q7,The_Rob_White,1 point,Wed Apr 8 18:41:42 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the manual link, looking good!  Yes, I have just read up on the Devo 10 and the 10mw/100mW/150mW settings. What I did not find out is how easy the 10mW European version can be flashed, according to a random blog the European version is protected but it can be overcome. Browsing rcgroups it seems like installing Deviation firmware is possible without issues.  I was wondering about the backorder issues at Hobbyking too, I experienced more then once that items did not return or where replaced. It is allways unclear if there is just no ETA or if they simply choose to publish a new product. Some items are still in the system even though they clearly have a successor.  I would love a Taranis (plus), but at 300€+, it is just no option at the moment. I suppose it either boilds down to a (used) dx6i or the Devo 10. The latter seems like a very flexible but still affordable option.  I never had to return stuff to Hobbyking, any idea how smooth that goes? Support in general has been rather wonky. I suppose they just give you in-store credit refunds?"
radiocontrol,31v8q7,jrwperformance,2,Wed Apr 8 19:19:14 2015 UTC,"Yeap, there is only one Devo 10, it's the same readio but the EU one has different software (I think it's a different bootloader), this only is with the stock firmware, with Deviation this limit is removed.  I am curious how Hobbyking will handle things, I've never had to return anything there, I've had quite a few bad parts and the odd thing missing from the order, but never returned anything either eaten the cost or had replacements sent."
radiocontrol,31v8q7,jrwperformance,1 point,Thu Apr 9 04:46:30 2015 UTC,"Devo 10 ordered :-) From a direct import company, seems like most national businesses don't carry it (yet), not even the old version.  We'll see about Hobbyking, but even if it is in-store credit, I am sure I can spend it somehow ;-) Luckily I never had real problems with them - so far.  Just when I ordered the Devo, I notices Hobbyking has a new OrangeRx futuba module with adjustable power output. Perhaps they will announce one for the jr/t/9xr as well?  But I think the Devo is the best overall choice on a budget with better gimbals. The touch screen Devo seems nice, but costs almost twice as much and it seems like be a bit problematic in sun light, despite the easier use.

Gotta bust your balls :P  You're probably not looking for tips, but just some advice: Work on 'blending' in yaw input with your rolls more. Give your yaw a bump right before you give the roll and use them together till you find the 'sweet spot'. Adjusting expo helps. You'll smooth out your sweeps and bank turns and everything will eventually get more fluid with practice. Boxing the sticks is fun, but when you can rip out fast and sharp circuits through FPV your flight game will open up all kinds of new possibilities. Try getting better flying LOS too, will help. Once you've got your yaw and roll ironed out, you can mix in pitch on those turns which is really where the money is at, especially if you're filming (sans gimbal) while flying FPV.  Also, make right turns!!!!!!!! :) Keep it up!!!"

You are wasting your money to put a fancy battery in it, since you will never ever feel the difference. Traction is the limiting factor, followed by either the motor or the ESC, not the Lipo.  Even the cheapest hardcase 5000mah 2S lipos can handle that car without even getting warm. What's the ESC rated for, 45 amps (probably overkill btw)? That's peanuts for any 5000mah lipo.  Also no sense in going only 4000mah if 5000mah will fit. Price is almost the same, weight difference is negligible and 25% longer runtime.  Both US Hobbyking warehouses have several different ones in stock to choose from for about half the price of the Venom. The connectors will be different than your Losi, so you'll have to convert the truck or the battery, or make an adapter."

I was about to say 'nothing much has changed' but for quad-copters, most radio brands are now offering a mode where you can send all the channels from the receiver to the flight controller with one signal wire, instead of one per channel. This means the Rx can be tiny and the wiring is neater. It's unlikely to be a problem unless you try to build a small quad.  It's really nice to fly without glitches though..."

radiocontrol,31hxs1,Anoma1y,1 point,Sun Apr 5 07:58:32 2015 UTC,"Make sure to center your servos. Plug servo into receiver, no trims on transmitter, power it on. Now put the horn on the servo at as close to 90 degrees as possible. Now go into the subtrim setting of the radio and apply a little subtrim to make the horn at 90 degrees. Your servo is centered, now you may attach it to the pushrod and make sure the length is right so that with the arm at 90 degrees, the flap is flush with the wing it's attached to.  It may still need some trim to counteract CG or other tendencies, but it probably won't be very extreme at all. I most recently built the FT Storch and it needed two clicks of left aileron and that was it. It flies like a dream. I think some folks don't know what is meant by centering a servo, or don't then use subtrim, so the control is asymmetric and the surface isn't neutral at center. If this was you, now you know!   After you trim, if you are using adjustable linkage stoppers, you can then loosen the linkage stopper and hold the surface in place as you undo the trim on your transmitter back to 0, then tighten the linkage stopper down, now you've sort of made the trim permanent."

I lost an entire season because the plane I bought/assembled didn't have properly sized control surfaces and was extremely tail heavy. My next plane I built from scratch and it has been great knowing that I can come home with a pile of broken foam and come back to the park with a working plane. The lessons learned have been fantastic.  As already suggested, a flight simulator is a must. If nothing more than to help you with the speed of your reflexes.

So many issues that they sent out a free upgrade, still had issues and eventually discontinued.  The engine never ran right on mine, it would never hold a tune, and I can get my jato engine running all the time perfectly.  The design was terrible too.  Because of the way it is designed, minor impact to the front left or right would bend the 6 bolts that held the front assembly.  It sits in pieces in my garage reminding me of the ~$500 I wish I could get back.   I've been out of the hobby for over 5 years but I used to know a lot.

radiocontrol,31ayds,Twisted_Cuber,1 point,Fri Apr 3 16:30:27 2015 UTC,"Also keep in mind that a battery's capacity depends on how much current you ask from it.  for example, if you take a battery that says ""1000 mAh"" on it, that value is implied to be at a specific load (or current).  It does not mean it can output one amp for one hour, even though arithmetically it would seem to do so (1000 mAh or mA*h or milliampere-hours, which is 1 ampere-hour, that is, one ampere for one hour). the rating is usually for relatively small loads. For Li-ion batteries, because they are used generally in high current devices (quadcopters, for instance) the rating they display are appropriate for that use. So a 1500 mAh li-ion (""LiPo"") battery probably can output 1.5 ampere for one hour... but for (say) four times that current, 6 ampere, the duration is not just one hour divided by four, 15 minutes, but less. could be 12 could be 10 i dunno.  for NiMH on the other hand, while an AA battery says 2300 mAh on it, they are usually for far less than an amp. NiMH batteries are the worst choice of the big three types of batteries (NiCd, LiPo, NiMH) for big loads.  In short... you probably can use the 9V but it will probably shorten the batteries' life a whole damn lot. Just don't. Also, don't mess with them, don't open them, don't make a voltage divider because you will melt everything. A buck converter might be theoretically possible to use, but practically... just... no. There is no point."

radiocontrol,31ayds,Twisted_Cuber,3,Fri Apr 3 20:45:58 2015 UTC,"lets's say  you want to go from 9v to 7.5v with a vol.div. and your quad sucks 10 ampere   so you put a 1.5 and a 7.5 resistor. 7.5*9/(1.5+7.5)= 7.5 so you get your 7.5 volts  how much current is going through that resistor pair? 9v/9ohm is 1 ampere. which means the 1.5 ohm resistor sucks up 1.5 w and the 7.5 ohm resistor 7.5 w.  you are losing 9 w at the resistors as heat. you would need to use high power resistors, a 2 W and a 10 W. those things are heavy.   and you'd still not take what you want. if you stick your quad to the 7.5v point at the vol.siv, and it sucks 10 ampere, those 10 A would go through the 1.5 ohm resistor. 10 a through 1.5 ohm is 15 v... you don't have that much  in short: voltage dividers are use only when you want to get a particular voltage but do not want to draw significant current."

radiocontrol,319n57,1541drive,2,Fri Apr 3 03:24:39 2015 UTC,Are you sure? The description says that they can handle 2-4s. What ESC's would be better?
radiocontrol,319n57,Act10n_List3n3r,1 point,Fri Apr 3 03:42:18 2015 UTC,"Specs says 4s, so they should handle that voltage just fine.  But 12A is the number to watch here. So google(something like ""2206 babybeast current draw prop"") for some data for those motors with different prop combinations, and match motors&props so you know you won't exceed amperage ratings.  Anyways, remember to get spare parts."
radiocontrol,319n57,xiMbd03u1,0,Fri Apr 3 04:03:53 2015 UTC,"Presumably if the motors are sold with the ESCs, then the ESC's aren't under-sized. They say they can be used with 6 inch props, so I would expect them to be able to handle at least 6x3 on 3S, and possibly 6x4.5. An amp meter would be a good investment to be sure.  People seem to have great results with the 12A Afro ESCs, so I wouldn't hesitate to get them. The Multistar motors sometimes have quality issues however. Also, I wouldn't personally get a CW/CCW set. The CW/CCW refers only to the direction of the threads on the prop shaft. All of the motors can spin in either direction depending on how they're wired up. The thinking is that you want the prop to be spinning in a direction that causes the nut to tighten, not loosen, so if the prop is spinning the other way, then you want the threads going the other way. The problem with this is that if you lose a reverse-threaded nut, it can be difficult to find a replacement. A good workaround is to either use Nylock nuts or to double-nut the props. This way, you can use all CW (standard) threaded adapters and not worry about finding spares.  These motors would not be particularly powerful compared to others. The ""standard"" beginner setup for a mini quad, if there is such a thing, is a 2300 kv motor running on 3S with a 5x3 prop. This will give low-ish thrust and longer runtime. Once you get more experience, you can step up to a 6x3 or a 6x4.5 prop, although not all motors and ESCs can handle 6x4.5. These motors are 2150 kv instead of 2300 kv, so they will spin a little slower and generate a little less thrust even than the usual 2300. However, their slightly lower kv rating makes them more suited to eventually running on 4S. Some ESCs and motors have sync issues with the very high rpms that result from running a higher-kv motor on 4S.  The battery you linked to is 4S. It's not generally recommended for beginners to start on 4S, but if you have enough flight experience and you apply a liberal dose of throttle expo, you could do okay with it. If you're a first-time flyer, I strongly recommend you stick with 3S. If you go with 4S and 6"" props, you may exceed the ESC's ratings, but I couldn't say for sure. Again--definitely invest in a cheap amp-meter to verify that you're not going to blow anything up. Something like this only costs $5."

radiocontrol,314s83,Airazz,2,Thu Apr 2 07:19:23 2015 UTC,From 5v USB it can take up to 4 hours.   You mean from the PC port? That's probably because most PCs can only supply 500 mA. That's why it charges longer.

Basically how it works is the inside of the hull is sealed off when in use, so everything could over heat very quickly. There's an intake on the bottom of the rudder, a NACA duct almost, and it picks up the water and pushes it through the water cooling, first to the ESC, then the cooling jacket on the motor, and finally out the side of the boat."

radiocontrol,310s18,lunarNex,1 point,Wed Apr 1 10:31:43 2015 UTC,"The invisible jet entered service in January 1942. It was designed by William Moulton who at the time worked for DC Comics. The invisible jet was first piloted by the super hero Wonder Woman, who demonstrated its abilities to fly supersonic. The invisible jet was the first aircraft to hold stealth technology, which at the time was known as a cloaking device. It was also known for its silent propulsion device, as well as it’s abilities to fly into outer space. Beyond all of this it was the first aircraft ever to operate as a drone, flying solely on Wonder Woman’s thoughts.  An industry first, the HobbyKing™ Invisible Jet is made from tough EP-NO foam and is superbly finished with transparent waterslide decals. As well as not looking the part, being Plug-and-fly, it is easy to assemble. The EDF unit, ESC, UBEC and servo's are all pre-installed, saving you the time in trying to find the invisible parts in the invisible box.   Jets are about performance and the HobbyKing™ Invisible Jet will not disappoint. It has excellent speed and climb rate, when you combine this performance with the real invisible presence of this model, not to mention the un-canny scale-like silent sound, the end result is one of the most unrealistic jets in this class. Where this Invisible Jet differs from other scale jets is that it is almost impossible to see. Fast, stable, scale, reliable, easy to store with, easy to fly and with zero visibility, the HobbyKing™ Invisible Jet will be extremely hard to see at any airfield. Ideal for people with poor vison, a must for any blind person!

radiocontrol,30ykkx,monkey_man_,1 point,Tue Mar 31 21:45:26 2015 UTC,"I have not tried it on this plane, but I have others with it too. It just rights itself and levels out quickly. Just make sure it is not heading towards trees when you use it. I almost lost my Apprentice S15e while testing out that mode a few years ago."

radiocontrol,30w2c9,MaxeMouse,2,Tue Mar 31 14:42:30 2015 UTC,Next up: A-team van. The stripes may not be on the top but it is fits your theme!
radiocontrol,30w2c9,Jens1970,1 point,Tue Mar 31 08:19:21 2015 UTC,"Not necessarily, the A-team van is a GMC, /u/jamesbecker211 is clearly a ford fan."
radiocontrol,30w2c9,MemorableC,2,Tue Mar 31 13:32:29 2015 UTC,Awesome Mustang body. Did that come in a kit or did you just buy it separately?

radiocontrol,3107hq,coonster,3,Wed Apr 1 02:28:52 2015 UTC,"I'd be leading more towards your battery is what's struggling.   The esc doesn't really power the motor and servos, it just lets the power through that is asked for by these components.   What battery are you currently running on it?  Edit: regarding your upgrade request, I'm on my phone at the moment but if you look through my comment history, I posted a recommendation to someone else recently."
radiocontrol,3107hq,Jeeeeesh,1 point,Wed Apr 1 04:54:23 2015 UTC,"It's this Turnigy 3S 2200mAh 20C pack.  The battery should be good for up to 40A and over 400W at 11.1v.  Of course, the voltage will sag under load but the plane should already be landed by the time that becomes much of an issue unless I'm underestimating how much the voltage will sag.  The ESC is a known weakpoint in the Bix3 RTF and PNF kits and gets very hot after flights.  It's this 20A ESC/3A UBEC."
radiocontrol,3107hq,Jeeeeesh,3,Wed Apr 1 05:05:30 2015 UTC,"Even with the 8x4 prop on, you shouldn't be pulling 20A peak, so might just be a case of overheating due to poor ventilation in the Bix3 and it's just shitting itself.  While you wait for new upgrades, try mounting it on the top of the engine cowling to get a bit of airflow to keep it cool.   When you say that you lose control under full throttle, do you mean your servos stop responding, or the motor loses power?"
radiocontrol,3107hq,Jeeeeesh,2,Wed Apr 1 05:29:55 2015 UTC,"I'll see what I can do about mounting it elsewhere but the battery wire and servo wire on the ESC are very short and I don't have any extenders or extra wire.  The problem with the Bix3's ventilation is that the battery placement (at least in some configurations) with proper CG blocks the air vent on the front.  The loss of control was from the servos not responding for a second or two while under full throttle or near-full throttle.  While ventilation seems to be a likely culprit, the ESC is known to be lousy.  Once I get a new ESC (and wire extensions), I'll definitely mount the ESC elsewhere.  Thank you for all your help!"
radiocontrol,3107hq,Jeeeeesh,3,Wed Apr 1 05:46:47 2015 UTC,I put my 65A one in this spot and haven't run in to any problems.  Pic 1  Pic 2   It's seen some rough flights but not a single issue with the electrics. I'm running a UBEC on it too.  I highly recommend the power set up I mentioned earlier. Gives you more than enough extra headspace to fly however you feel like on the day.
radiocontrol,3107hq,NoTifuToday,2,Wed Apr 1 06:02:22 2015 UTC,"Thanks.  I can't actually mount the ESC in that spot since it's the top of the removable wings on the Bix3.  I'll see where I could mount it externally (such as behind the main part of the body).  Do you mean that you are running a UBEC separately from the BEC in the ESC?  If so, how are you powering both?  How do you like that ESC?  The specs are excellent for the price and would give me a ton of room to upgrade.  The built-in BEC is also rated for 4A which is way more than most so it should more than alleviate my initial issue."
radiocontrol,30xmm2,TxRENEGADE12,1 point,Tue Mar 31 15:18:32 2015 UTC,Don't mind the date I couldn't figure out the time stamp. It is from a few days ago. There is a crash at the end for the lazy
radiocontrol,30w7vn,Badapple18,2,Tue Mar 31 05:07:54 2015 UTC,"So with my spitfire dead and needing to fill my warbird racer gap I found a used kit built 64"" P-40 warhawk. The OS .55 ax that powered the spitfire was to small for this new bird so I repurposed my OS .15gt gas motor. It seams to be a perfect fit and should fly this model with authority. I still need to make custom wheel struts for the retracts and get a BEC for the ignition so I don't have to run a second battery. I can't wait to fly and report back. Nobody that I have seen is racing with a gas engine it will be interesting to compare."
radiocontrol,30w7vn,Anoma1y,1 point,Tue Mar 31 05:12:50 2015 UTC,That's one beautiful warbird! I bet she'll be quite the racer. Make sure you report back with your maiden
