If OP is not lying, then yes, the father has no business becoming clergy and you are defending a pedophile.  Even if the father is repentant, any church of sane disposition would avoid him since he doesn't meet the Biblical qualifications.  We have seen what happens when you put penitent pedophiles back around children - a number of churches are dealing with the abuse they caused when they reoffended.

God is not going to stop you from pumping out kids you can't afford... I have a conservative Catholic coworker who has been married for 3 years and has 3 children... His youngest is 3 months old or so , therefore I am expecting his announcement of additional offspring any time now. He is soon going to hit the point where he will not be able to afford the number of children he has.   My wife and I have 4 kids... we are no slouches in the offspring department... (we planned on having 2 children... remember those disclaimers that state no form of contraception is 100%...well we are a living testament to that fact) I believe God gives us a head to be more than a hatstand and has endowed us with a level of free agency to make wise decisions based on things like income, time one has to spend with ones kids, ministry ,et cetera. Having so many children that one cannot financial my care for them or give them a proper amount of attention is foolish in my book."

The missionaries would send their kids to boarding schools when they hit the age of 5 or so and see their kids at Christmas and for a bit at summer break... Sometime this separation was due to the safety issue of having children there and sometimes it was due to the overwhelming amount of work that needed to be accomplished precluded educating one's children in the field.  In some ways it would have been better to not have children if they are going to spend the overwhelming majority away from you.  Second, they are a lot of children in foster care and in need of adoption by loving, stable families. If a couple was to forego having biological children in favor of adopting, I would see this as a very honorable thing."

To wit:     Immaculate Conception? or The Persistence of Sperm?  In 1988, a 15-year-old girl living in the small southern African nation of Lesotho came to local doctors with all the symptoms of a woman in labor. But the doctors were quickly puzzled because, upon examination, she didn't have a vagina.  Her birth defect -- called Mullerian agenesis or Mayer-Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser syndrome -- didn't necessarily surprise doctors, but her pregnancy did. Even the 15-year-old girl could not believe she was pregnant.  Yet by looking at her records the hospital staff realized the young woman was in the hospital 278 days earlier with a knife wound to her stomach. The average pregnancy lasts 280 days. After interviews, they gathered that ""Just before she was stabbed in the abdomen she had practiced fellatio with her new boyfriend and was caught in the act by her former lover. The fight with knives ensued.""  The girl arrived at the hospital with an empty stomach -- and therefore with little stomach acid around -- and doctors found two holes from a stab wound that opened her stomach up to her abdominal cavity. The case report said doctors washed her stomach out with a salt solution and stitched her up.  ""A plausible explanation for this pregnancy is that spermatozoa gained access to the reproductive organs via the injured gastrointestinal tract,"" the authors wrote."

That's pretty clear from scripture and tradition. Yes, most people, even most observant Christians, violate that sometimes. It's wrong, but shit happens. When we've done it we have to deal with the consequences and move on.  But sex also changes us a bit in an immediate temporal way, one that can't be taken back by repentance. That's backed up studies (which have repeatedly shown that premarital sex seriously lowers both chances of staying married and marital satisfaction, for both men and women, I'll cite if you like). We can be forgiven, but that act works irrevocable changes on our character.  That's not just a sexual thing. Guys who've killed people have trouble reintegrating back into civilian society. There's a whole spectrum of behaviors out there that we can repent, but we can't quite erase from our persona, at least not during this lifetime.  TL;DR: We can be forgiven anything, but our actions change us."

Treating children as a burden to be carried rather than a blessing to be cherished is just fucked up, and it's an attitude that is incredibly prevalent in secular culture- it goes hand in hand with anti-Christian sexual mores which have divorced sex from the production of children, a certain brand of naturalism which seeks to kill off humans before we can kill Mother Earth, and all sorts of other non-Christian ideas."

brokehugs,3dnrwv,drunkenrabbit,-1,Mon Jul 20 00:13:03 2015 UTC,"So, Franklin Graham is a moron, but still...  Liberal democracy isn't great at tolerating the intolerant. And the European countries that have large Muslim populations have serious domestic issues - with honor killings, etc.  The US is uniquely blessed in having a population of fairly western-sympathetic, democracy compatible Muslims. But that might not always be the case. Patterns of immigration shift. And if they ever do, we might be stuck with asking ourselves what priority we have to put on accepting the religious and cultural beliefs of Muslim immigrants versus upholding the values of American democracy and civil rights.   The irony being, we can't restrict Muslim immigration while adhering to our own principles. I'm not saying we should restrict immigration from any specific ethnic or religious group, but that mass immigration raises questions that most of us are too squeamish to answer."

I just stopped wasting energy over there because I realized that actually meeting and discussing religion face-to-face is a far more life enriching experience. Sure, it takes a bit more courage, but I rarely leave those encounters feeling like I need to take a shower - which is what my encounters on the mothersub were devolving into some months ago.

brokehugs,3dh699,Lankshire,21,Thu Jul 16 06:13:37 2015 UTC,It just looked like people questioning the actual numbers and the methodology used. Maybe I missed something?
brokehugs,3dh699,funny-original-name,19,Thu Jul 16 07:21:18 2015 UTC,"I think my frustration came from reading the researched journal articles that were cited, not the websites, but the articles, and seeing how most of them were very humble and would say that their study was not an exhaustive study and that further research was necessary.   It's not like someone surveyed thirty gay people, and said ""Welp! Half of them were kicked out of the home, therefore half of all gay people were kicked out of the home"". That's not what happened, and those who were criticizing the studies [that never were meant to be exhaustive, but rather help gain preliminary research], made it sound like the original researchers were saying that their results were conclusive to an actual number.   The articles I read all stated about how any methodology counting homeless adolescents is going to be incredibly difficult, so an actual number is going to be near impossible. This is because homeless kids avoid people who look like they're authority figures [i.e., people walking around town with clip boards to count kids]. Counting lgbt kids would be even harder because of abuses they faced and face today.   So my problem wasn't that the articles were being criticized, but rather that the criticisms weren't coming from a place that seemed like they respected the researchers. I have a friend who almost hates academia, and he is always nit-picking articles. His recent bend is on an article our professor wrote. My friend said that the sample size was shit, and our professor needs to lose his job since he can't research for crap. The last line of my professor's article is ""My results are not generalizable, but do indicate more research is needed"". My friend cannot read with charity.   Likewise, the researchers were mostly open about the limitations they faced, or at least were slow to generalize their results to the entire population. The people who were criticizing the studies made it sound like the researchers 100% sure their results were conclusive, when the researchers were very open to their limitations."
brokehugs,3dh699,wildgwest,9,Thu Jul 16 12:47:45 2015 UTC,"This stuff just isn't being studying well and competently. It needs more funding.  Anyway, all homelessness is a problem, and I think we can certainly say that homeless GLT youth are probably over-represented, since they should be, at most, what, like 7-8% of the population? Christians need to take this seriously, and they need to not contribute to it.   One of the people who is most critical of the studies, or the conclusions people who were not the researchers were drawing, also said those two things."
brokehugs,3dh699,OntologicalAbsurdity,3,Thu Jul 16 13:12:42 2015 UTC,"I saw this and this definitely helped me understand that he wasn't coming from a place of hostility. My points still remain. This isn't relevant to my post though, because criticisms were being directed at a strawman (that the researchers had conclusive evidences), rather than what the studies actually said (that there are troubling trends that deserve more study).  I'm glad he said that he still agreed with some of the conclusions, even though he felt the studies were poorly done."

I even said that GLT homelessness and Christian contributions to it were a real problem. But bad data is bad data, and inconclusive data is inconclusive. It's fine if your funding or cooperation of subjects runs out before you get where you need to be, we've all been there, but in that case, you state that loud and clear ""Our findings were inconclusive because we couldn't get the proper demographic of homeless programs to respond,"" you don't be mealy-mouthed about ""needing more study"" it so that doofus bloggers think you've got hard evidence to support their viewpoint( relevant ). Again, I got burned on this before; I tried to look up stats supporting trans* suicides and it was just a lot of shadows and rumors, hard data was limited and far between.  Sorry your funding ran out. Hustle more and present next year when you have something solid. Maybe target a smaller area (Queens only, etc.) and go in person to wrangle the data from faith-based organizations. The methodology of this survey specifically polls the places where concentrations of GLT teens are likely to be highest, and presents what is most likely a very skewed sample as a result which is not representative of the national network of homeless programs. While others said that they don't think that the number would change much, I have no such confidence. I think that, if gay teens are sensible about wanting to avoid the religion that threw them out, that the concentration at these non-religious shelters that made up 75% of the survey but in reality make up probably 40-50% of the shelters IRL, might have a GLT population that is twice as high as the religious shelters.  I definitely didn't mean to dismiss the issue, and, of course, the anecdotal support of Plaver, who has been both homeless and a minister to them, is worth hearing out."

And I'm the horrible liberal who does care about LGBT youth...stuff like this doesn't help anyone."
brokehugs,3dh699,PaedragGaidin,5,Thu Jul 16 14:53:18 2015 UTC,"That study, if RHE even cited it, was not about a comprehensive study, it was a qualitative interview of variots gsy adolecents. RHE cited a website with similar stats, but the website didn't formally cite that specific article directly, so idk if that's the actual article being cited for the percentages."
brokehugs,3dh699,wildgwest,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:54:33 2015 UTC,"I guarantee this is the exact study she is citing.  You're right that her link takes you to a site that doesn't provide sources.  But if you google it, you see the same 26% statistic all over the place.  The source of it is a 2006 report done by The National LGBTQ Task Force, which seems to be an advocacy group.  If you read the report--pdf link, you see that the 26% statistic is referenced.  And the study referenced is the one I described in my post--the 1987 study in the Journal of Pediatrics.  This study is also the original source of the ""50% of gay teens experienced a negative reaction"" statistic that RHE also references.  My problem is that this not-at-all comprehensive, out-of-date study is being presented as the scientifically proven current state of affairs."
brokehugs,3dh699,jobeavs,-2,Thu Jul 16 19:28:47 2015 UTC,There's a technical word to describe those sort of studies.  Bullshit.
brokehugs,3dh699,davidjricardo,7,Thu Jul 16 17:24:34 2015 UTC,"As a social scientist, what are non-bullshit qualitative studies like?"
brokehugs,3dh699,asked2rise,5,Thu Jul 16 18:42:28 2015 UTC,"First, the study in question wasn't really a qualitative study.  It was just a really shitty quantitative study.  The author used a crummy sampling design to gather a tiny sample of individuals, then administered a survey, and reported results with some minimal analysis.  There may have been some small qualitative aspect in coding the survey answers, but that's about it.  Most quantitative studies will have some degree of similar qualitative work.  What constitutes a good qualitative study?  One example would be pure ethnographic studies, like this paper by Levitt and Venkatesh.  Other good qualitative work would include anything with sound, objective methodology and independently verifiable results.  For example: this paper by Romer and Romer uses narrative analysis to identify the primary motivation for tax bills."
brokehugs,3dh699,davidjricardo,3,Thu Jul 16 20:31:05 2015 UTC,Not really. Qualitative data like the study i mentioned can suggest to us problem areas worth digging into. It allows us to not fly blind in our more quantitative studies.
brokehugs,3dh699,wildgwest,4,Thu Jul 16 17:41:52 2015 UTC,"that's fair. But beyond the data, instead of people going ""well shit, homeless is a problem that should be fixed! They say, ""let's jump into the numbers and prove we arnt terrible people!""  The majority of Christians are very decent people, I just was annoyed. I was also very tipsy, so there is that."
brokehugs,3dh699,monarchynotdemocracy,8,Thu Jul 16 15:51:15 2015 UTC,It's a valid point though. A sampling of 29 people isn't very strong evidence of anything.
brokehugs,3dh699,wildgwest,6,Thu Jul 16 07:22:07 2015 UTC,"The study of 29 people was not intended to be a comprehensive study of lgtb homelessness. It came from a study that simply interviewed 29 gay adolescents, and asked them about their experiences. It was not indented to have its results generalized to the entire population."
brokehugs,3dh699,jobeavs,5,Thu Jul 16 12:12:34 2015 UTC,"And yet it is being generalized.  That's the problem.  Google something like ""26% gay kicked out"" and you see several sites stating this number as current fact.  On the first results page alone, I found six sites that referenced this statistic.  If they do list the source for this number, it always goes back to the task force report and the original 1987 study.    The most hilarious example of this is from The Gay and Lesbian Connection site which states the following   Twenty-three years ago statistics indicated that 25% of LGBT youth who came out to their parents were kicked out of the house and abandoned.   With all the progress that has been made since that time for gay rights, and all the exposure and acceptance that gays have received, I was disheartened to read an recent article from the Indypendent that currently twenty-six percent of LGBT youth who come out to their parents are kicked out of their home. (Stats from a report from the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force)   In both cases, literally the same freaking study is being referenced.  The same. freaking. study."
brokehugs,3dh699,wildgwest,0,Thu Jul 16 19:46:18 2015 UTC,"It seems your problem is not the original article, but rather how it is used. My problem is, it seems like the the article is being attacked for something it was never meant to be. If people are pissed at it being used, go for it, the article isn't the problem, it's the misuse of the article. That's my issue. This should also serve as a response to your other reply to me."

As for rape, well most people (especially most women) are horrified of the thought of even thinking or mentioning of rape. Just because of someone is raped it doesn't mean that they probably won't enjoy getting raped and might even want more of rape. For example, when I was a 10 year old boy hitting puberty and becoming sexually interested in girls, I had a fetish for wanting to get kidnapped by older girls (in their 20's and 30's as long as they were very sexy) and they each take turns raping me nonstop and treating me like a human dildo and an object and even treating me like their personal boy whore, all without me giving any consent at all and my mind wouldn't even be capable of getting the police.

The top post is from /u/terevos2 saying to talk to the person as a church member, not starting a process of church discipline.   He even specifically stated in the thread not to make an assumption about the church member's motivation before doing so, that doesn't sound like a witch-hunt.  For many churches, especially those in the Reformed tradition they do have a process of church discipline and asking a question on the Reformed Subreddit over whether or not that should be considered is, I think, a fair discussion to at least have.   A lot of churches do not practice church discipline at all-    Right   but to even consider informally starting procedures is unfounded.    If the church in question was opposed to same-sex marriage, I don't see why you wouldn't at least have a conversation with the person in question.   I am not rocking a rainbow avatar, but I was fully supportive of marriage equality. I don't do trendy.    Cool?   So it sets up a witch hunt of sorts- is the church going to informally question everyone who has a rainbow avatar?   I guess? If I saw a group of church members marching in the gay pride parade I would ask them questions about it. I wouldn't assume what their motivations were though.    If they are in support of marriage equality, what then? No communion for you?   Well I'd probably agree with /u/terevos2, one could have changed it and been in favor of marriage equality because of their view on Separation of Church and State.   The only concern for actually going through with church discipline would be if they felt that same-sex marriage was non-sinful."

Surely your church wouldn't let an atheist take communion?   I moved recently, but the church I mist rececently attended had a boilerplate spiel about Communion being for Christians-but they didn't police it. I grew up in a Plymouth Brethren church for a good part if my youth and they have ""closed"" congregations where one has to prove ones self in order to partake.

I take no issue with church discipline and in this scenario it would be prudent to dig a little deeper and talk this through. I have a friend who is a pastor in a town nearby- When he arrived at the church the youth pastor pro tem was a dude who was big into Holocaust denial and quoting David Duke.... Needless to say they had a chit chat and he was no longer youth leader. This is a situation that needed to be addressed. Racist youth pastor left the church and is now in leadership in another small Baptist church. All in all there is a rather large segment of the population in the state I live in that believes something akin to what you stated about those of Hispanic descent. The ""n"" word is used quite liberally as well as other ethnic slurs. So some churches in my area would not bat an eye if someone spouted off like this.   Where do you draw the line?

People with ancestors of mixed race were considered to be black and only people who had no black ancestry were considered to be white.  In practice these people are not opposed to interracial marriage - they are opposed to diluting pure white blood lines because they have no problem with the idea of a mixed race person marrying someone of pure African descent - it only becomes when a white person is involved.

Whether any one person finds a particular justification compelling is a distinct question.
brokehugs,3cvlm8,wordsmythe,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:12:11 2015 UTC,"No. That's the point. There are some issues which have two sides which both have reasonable arguments. Homosexuality on the other hand is a closed case. There's no real moral arguments that hold in any well defended moral theory, as well as no real room for one to come up later, so they keep dredging up a thing which has not been a serious argument in hundreds of years and insisting that because it is technically an argument it must be a reasonable one. Their very particular interpretation of natural law has so many arbitrary assumptions worked into it that to consider it a serious case basically implies not understating or willfully choosing to not care about how serious ethics are done. Standards which consider it serious despite its like 20 assumptions that have to all work for it to be true, most of which are arbitrary, and some of which are openly incorrect / special pleading are so low that you could make a case for almost anything if you accept those as reasonable standards. And all that is on top of that you can't make it correspond to a meaningful value, so you have to use poetic language to make it sound like you did.  Basically anyone who finds their anti homosexual arguments compelling either doesn't really get ethics, or does but doesn't care that they're letting the fact that a tradition wants it to be true override whether it is. This is close to the level of evolution vs creationism by now. The ""other side"" is just people who don't get the field."

brokehugs,3cvlm8,wordsmythe,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:13:04 2015 UTC,"Yes it does? People aren't morally allowed their own facts that contradict reality just because they define themselves as in a tradition where that's okay. Just like its incorrect for them to be creationists, except in this case they are hurting other people directly.

brokehugs,3cvfv5,EmeraldOrbis,1 point,Sat Jul 11 08:37:16 2015 UTC,"The SRS use this excuse to justify non-NP linking all the time. Just because you decided to make a run at a sub 4x+ your size and so the brigade ends up doing little to influence voting patterns, doesn't mean it wasn't a transparent attempt at hostile traffic recruitment. If you punch a rhino in the head, and it doesn't notice and continues eating, it doesn't mean that the statement ""I didn't attack the rhino"" is true.  I don't know anything about 8Chan, so I can't really speculate on what their power to influence the sub might be. For Reddit (at least on other subs where I've tested this more closely), a good rule of thumb is that for a sub the size of r/Christianity, posts with <600 upvotes have about a 40-50x traffic multiple, meaning that if you've got 75 upvotes it's been visited around 3500-4000ish times. Once it goes much above that, the multiple may rise to 75 or 100, and if it reaches /r/All like the post of the dad's marked up bible years ago, all bets are off. You may be talking about a 200x multiple before it drops off the radar.  Of course, the participation vastly favors lurkers; having 3500 upvotes on comments in a thread with 50 total upvotes is absolutely unheard of."

The idea of a marriage, despite the reality of infertility, being ""ordered to procreation"" exists in Catholicism.  It simply doesn't exist in US marriage law, though, and I can't think of a place where that a similar idea exists in US law overall.  /R/catholics and Ryan Anderson don't seem to realize it, but this is where their beliefs about marriage become practically incoherent when it hits the secular sphere.

True, this is already Catholic teaching   I did not know that the Catholic Church has a monopoly on marriage (since as a sacrament it was instituted by Jesus Himself, not having its roots ""from the beginning""). Huh. TIL.   The Catholic Church should consider all Western marriages “dubious” since most contemporary married people are generally lacking formal and material intent. Those who are not practicing Catholics enter into an arrangement called “marriage” that does not correspond to the traditional Christian definition that ensures monogamy, procreation, and heterosexuality.   Not at all true. Despite what facebook may tell you, most people are straight, most think of marriage as monogamous, and most connect their kids with their marriage. People reserve the right to do whatever they wish after the Sexual Revolution, but most people don't actually exercise that much freedom beyond premarital sex.  It's still pretty ideal and normal to get married, have kids, settle down. Yay pair bonding.   The Catholic Church has traditionally and charitably presumed that Protestant marriages are valid and even sacramental. The Catholic Church should rescind this presumption since most Protestant denominations believe in divorce and remarraige   Mmmmm. Delicious. Don't mind me, I'll just be over here with my no-divorces-in-four-generations-and-31-marriages Protestant family having invalid sacraments.   All Catholic marriage prep should end with a video recording of the male and the female to be married in which both personally articulate the Catholic teaching about matrimony, monogamy, indissolubility, procreation and contraception, and heterosexuality.    The goal of this video taping is to increase cognitive dissonance when the couple wants to get divorced an annulment because Catholics don't get divorced, silly Prot.  The more cognitive dissonance the better- the goal here is to guilt-trip people into staying in their marriages.  THIS IS WHAT CATHOLICS ON THE INTERNET ACTUALLY BELIEVE.  ...followed by some actual good points on how marriage should be viewed as religious in nature for religious people and pre-marital sex is Badong.  Then:   When the judge or minister says, “Is there any reason why these two should not be married? Speak now or forever hold your peace,” you are morally obliged as a patriotic citizen of your community and as a baptized Christian to speak up and say it.   That's a real thing?

You cannot be leading each other into mortal sin as you prepare for this holy state. What if a Seminarian started to celebrate Mass and hear confessions before his ordination? He would be dismissed. But what if the seminarian said, “Yeah, but I needed to try it out to see if it was a right fit?” Sorry. Still dismissed. He’s not worthy to be priest. Yet, why are we so lazy and lax when it comes to the other sacrament of vocation.   You wouldn't have any married couples then, lol!   Recapture Holy Matrimony as a church event and this means we need to distance ourselves from the pomp of the afterparty, flowers, cake, guests, etc. Holy Matrimony should feel more somber like a priestly ordination and less like a Quinceañera or debutant ball. Holy Matrimony is not a narcissistic parade for princesses and their mothers. It’s a sacrament. Rein it in.   Bah, humbug!  Sorry, I'm going to a catholic wedding soon, and while there will be a serious sacrament, afterwards we are going to go party hard.   Oh, the couple has also already lived together for a year and uses birth control. Just FYI.   Hang on to your Catholic vocabulary. If you have a gay co-worker who is “married” don’t call his partner a “husband” and don’t call his union a “marriage.” You wouldn’t call a Protestant service “a Mass” and you wouldn’t call the Reverend Jesse Jackson a “priest” or “Father.” I also don’t call a Lutheran a “Catholic” even though he claims to be one. Sorry, I have to be true to my beliefs. If I get fired, so be it. If you don’t follow your conscience, you’ll be miserable.

brokehugs,3c1jar,asked2rise,-2,Sat Jul 4 04:23:13 2015 UTC,"To me, justice means criminal penalties for crimes, civil penalties for civil issues. If the bakers committed a crime, they need to be doing community service or in jail. If there is a civil issue, they need to make restitution in kind. Civilized countries should not use fines to punish crimes, you shouldn't be able to buy your way out of a crime.   No person has ever or will ever endure $135,000 worth of ""emotional distress"" over not getting a cake from their first choice of baker because the baker is a nasty bigot. That's like a doctor's post-tax-and-insurance take-home salary for an entire year, over one cake."
brokehugs,3c1jar,TurretOpera,10,Sat Jul 4 04:34:42 2015 UTC,"It's not about putting a monetary value on the damage caused. Fees like this are not intended to reconciliatory but rather to be punative. The judge would have chosen this number based on how much revenue the bakery has to determine an amount that would sting them appropriately for misbehavior.  As far as the judge is concerned, this is the amount that will convince them not to do this again... It's not the amount that the victim's suffering is ""worth"". You can't put a monetary value on something like that.  Without knowing how much capital the bakery has, how much their annual earnings are, etc, none of us are in a position to say whether the judgment is fair or not."

Because that's literally what ""emotional damages"" implies. And yes, while death and dismemberment may be incredibly difficult to put a dollar figure on, is rather simple to put a monetary value on the suffering caused by not getting a $300-1200 cake; $300-1200+maybe two 8-hour days' wages max to make up for the aggravation of having to source the cake somewhere else if the gay couple is too old or technologically illiterate to use Google. Sure, maybe pegging the precise dollar-and-cent value might be hard, ""Is it $675 or $675.25?"", but although you can't say that a carpenter punching a hole in your wall out of bigotry when finding out you're a Wiccan caused precisely $100 or $500 worth of ""emotional damage,"" logic (which is almost always absent from tort rulings) dictates that the emotional damage probably does not mean that the carpenter owes you a second $350,000 house over a damaged sheet of drywall and a religious slur.   If the judge's intent was to make sure the bakery wouldn't ""misbehave"" (legally) again, then he should have said either recant and make this couple the most expensive cake you regularly produce that they desire, or else lose you right to operate this kind of business in this county or state. If a restaurant won't serve black people, I don't want them to have to pay one black couple $100,000 over a lost sandwich, that's asinine and unjust to all parties involved (except, invariably the lawyer, who will collect his $60,000+ in ""you-don't-pay-unless-we-win"" legal fees happily). I want them to serve all black people or close, since that's what the law demands, not money, but operating with equity. Equal protection shouldn't be a lottery jackpot for the first couple to accidentally walk into a bigoted business; it should take the ""lottery"" aspect of getting fair and decent service out of it entirely, by ensuring compliance, and closing (not fining) businesses that won't agree to abide by federal and state regulations."
brokehugs,3c1jar,TurretOpera,10,Sat Jul 4 16:19:41 2015 UTC,"It's not the cost of the emotional damages, it's the punishment for causing emotional damages in the form of money, the only relevant form of punishment for a capitalist business.

If a crime has been committed, jail or community service should be the punishment. If what happened was not a crime, than restitution fitting the material harm (in this case, like $1000) should be the punishment. Discrimination laws shouldn't be a lottery where one person gets paid for crimes that affect a whole class of people; the most direct way to stop a business from discriminating is to tell them to stop or close, not to give them a fine that they might be able to pay off and then continue."

Being on the internet is a massive boon to forming these deviant views, because the anonymity relieves the social pressure to conform and eliminates shame associated with those views. This is often bad, but sometimes not. My views on a host of Christian issues have been improved and nuanced by posting here, whereas in my more insular real life, I might never have had a chance to have my views informed by, say, an Orthodox Jew, or a Syriac Orthodox Christian, or an antitheist. I know for a fact from their testimony that a number of GSM regulars here have found a similar outlet online to grow away from their conservative upbringing and embrace more critical/liberal forms of the faith.

brokehugs,3bj1tn,US_Hiker,7,Tue Jun 30 18:26:44 2015 UTC,"I mean, that's been a point made recurringly by folks here, and by many folks I know that have simply ended up leaving because it became too difficult and aggravating for them.  The clincher is that the rules say that ""bigotry"" is not allowed. But clearly certain forms of bigotry are not just allowed, but pretty much given the mod ""seal of approval."" This underhanded practice has the effect of presenting bigoted views (such as ""conversion"" therapy) as inherently benign and not bigoted.   But the mods seem more interested in protecting not just conservative voices, because there are many decent conservatives there. But, rather, a subset of very conservative voices because these folks continually complain that the subreddit isn't enough like a church, doesn't conform to or like their theological positions, allows LGBT folks like myself to even post, and so on. You'd think, upon seeing the 8chan clusterfuck, that the mods might reconsider their actions.   But these groups of people complain, and make the big ""screw you guys, I'm leaving"" posts, and continue to ""legally"" (according to subreddit rules) hound and abuse more ""liberal"" and LGBT users. And they get not just a blind eye from the mods, but actual protection. Whereas the more liberal folks and LGBT folks simply seem to quietly melt away when they can't take the abuse anymore. They just slowly stop posting there, or just leave reddit altogether. But the mods, or at least those who matter, just don't give a shit."

One of the reasons I went to /r/Christianity was to explore the idea of whether I could be in the same church/denomination with people who had bigoted ideas about gay people.  The answer for me is that I think I belong in my church, which is affirming and fighting the good fight within our denomination, but that there are some flavors of Christianity that I just don't think I want to deal with.

Tepid_Radical_Reform, funny-original-name, PaedragGaidin, giziti, Acorn_Prof, and I could probably list dozens more. But, on the other hand, I don't live in a bubble in my offline life.

Some have taken Orthodoxy to mean Russophilia.  This is particularly true in ROCOR parishes, though you see it in some corners of the OCA (though it's not as common, as the OCA is a bit more American).  Some Greeks really do want Byzantium back (which is a result of Ottoman rule).  My friends and I joke about launching a crusade against ISIS, but it's nothing more than us being ridiculous.

brokehugs,3b74hd,PaedragGaidin,18,Fri Jun 26 23:48:06 2015 UTC,"They're not all making fun of you. Many of them are concerned because you seem lost in fear right now. Whoever taught you these things about God and Christianity - that we're fighting a literal war, that we should pray for God to pour his wrath on America - they're either lying to you or similarly lost to fear.  God is love. Jesus called us to love constantly. In fact, he was pretty clear that loving God and loving others is the most important thing. Paul tells us how to love in [1 Corinthians 13]. He describes it as patient, kind, not boastful, envious or proud. He describes it as not self-seeking, not easily angered, and not keeping a record of wrongs committed.  He goes so far as to say that no matter how faithful we are, no matter how correct our theology is, no matter how many miracles we can or can't perform - if we are not loving in the way described above, we are nothing.  And so that's why people are upset at your post. There is no place for Biblical love in a prayer for wrath and judgment, even if you believe homosexuality is a sin (and you can definitely believe that while still holding to Biblical love for others). You seem like someone who's sincerely trying to figure out this Christianity thing, so I hope and pray that you can understand the importance and meaning of God's love.   God bless!  /u/versebot"

[2] If I have the gift of prophecy, and know all mysteries and all knowledge; and if I have all faith, so as to remove mountains, but do not have love, I am nothing. [3] And if I give all my possessions to feed the poor, and if I surrender my body to be burned, but do not have love, it profits me nothing. [4] Love is patient, love is kind and is not jealous; love does not brag and is not arrogant, [5] does not act unbecomingly; it does not seek its own, is not provoked, does not take into account a wrong suffered, [6] does not rejoice in unrighteousness, but rejoices with the truth; [7] bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things. [8] Love never fails; but if there are gifts of prophecy, they will be done away; if there are tongues, they will cease; if there is knowledge, it will be done away. [9] For we know in part and we prophesy in part; [10] but when the perfect comes, the partial will be done away. [11] When I was a child, I used to speak like a child, think like a child, reason like a child; when I became a man, I did away with childish things. [12] For now we see in a mirror dimly, but then face to face; now I know in part, but then I will know fully just as I also have been fully known.

brokehugs,3b74hd,IdlePigeon,7,Sat Jun 27 01:07:46 2015 UTC,"If a decision by the courts makes you physically angry, it would be wise to step back for a bit and contemplate why. Does it draw anger because of your religious views or does it draw anger because it violates the principle spirit of the constitution that founded this nation?    If it is the former, then perhaps take moment to realize that not everyone believes as you do and very much have as much right to disagree with your views as you do to hold such views.    If it is the latter, then the correct response is not anger, but action. If you believe that this decision by the Supreme Court oversteps their bounds and violates the checks and balances of the governmental system, express such sentiment through writing everyone you can: senators, representatives, governers, the president, justices, etc. And back up your opinion through active voting practice.    If anger is your first reaction, rather than concern for others with a loving heart, then something is amiss and you are not fulfilling the vocation of love commanded by your Lord.     I get that you have some controversial opinions, but if you believe that you are called by Christ to hold such views, than you are equally called to accept the reactions of those who oppose you.

Did a brigade happen here? That post was pretty well into positive earlier today... and at that point I assumed that my point was understood well-enough. But now I'm not so sure, so I'll elaborate a bit.  I agree with you, I don't think it's a serious threat to the United States that churches or pastors will somehow be forced to marry gays or face imprisonment. To treat it like a tangible threat, yeah, it's not, in my opinion.  But ... Denmark, one of the first countries to legalize gay civil unions many years ago, has recently had a court case forcing all churches to allow gay marriages. There's also been a case in the past couple years in the U.K. where a couple of millionaires, who have the resources to go anywhere they want for a wedding, are suing to force U.K. churches to allow them to have a same-sex wedding there. It's pretty clear to me that there are individuals, if not the entire community, who are, in fact, interested in taking this decision and going further. This isn't a ""mole people stealing toothpaste"" conspiracy theory. This is a ""apparently, people are already issuing these types of challenges elsewhere, some of the dissenting Supreme Court Justices have expressed some concerns, and a few news outlets--serious, analytical news outlets, I mean, not Glenn Beck or something--are carrying stories about negative side-effects of this ruling on tax-exempt status of churches or religious-institutions with rules against same-sex marriage.  But it's not only realistic to think that at least some people do want to force all churches to marry gays (or at least, to have to choose between marrying gays and losing tax-exempt status), it's naive to say that it's so unlikely as to not even be worth discussing.  And what I did here was not advocate that this is something to fear, or worse make the hackneyed slippery-slope argument that it is somehow now inevitable. I don't believe that.  What I said was that instead of burying anybody who shares such an opinion, we should address it as adults who can politely disagree. -1 points."

brokehugs,3b74hd,Duke_of_New_Dallas,8,Fri Jun 26 20:11:07 2015 UTC,"The cases in the UK and Denmark both involve state churches, they are fundamentally not comparable to the United States. Actual churches in the US are not at risk of losing their tax exempt status, they been discriminating against far more protected groups for generations and there's never been any serious movement to take away their tax exemptions. Non-church organizations will of course be expected to follow the same rules as everyone else, this is not oppression.  And of course you still haven't answered why it is that churches have never been forced to conduct interracial marriages despite the fact that opposing such marriages is almost universally despised.  There are people who believe the world is the centre of the universe, people who believe it's flat, people who believe the it's a hollow sphere with us all living on the inside and the rest of the universe in the centre, and of course there are people who believe there's a serious risk of American churches being forced to conduct same sex marriages, not all opinions are worthy of serious consideration."

I'll go ahead and repeat it now, too. I'm not making that argument. I'm making the meta-argument that people who want to talk about it are people, and that it's worth listening to them and talking about their perspectives as peers, not as subhumans. You could tell them, for instance, the difference between the US and Denmark or the UK, like how we have a constitutional protection against establishing religion or prohibiting its free exercise.   the only thing they illustrate is that people who bring them up are one of two thing:   Extraordinarily ignorant and therefore not worth listening to. Maliciously twisting the facts and therefore really not worth listening to.    In my opinion, if someone is communicating with a respectful tone about a sincerely held belief, they're worth being heard, even if they're wrong. If you disagree, just explain why. What's the point of going out of your way to label them as ignorant or malicious?  If people are trolling you with insincere beliefs, or they have sincere beliefs but they're treating you uncharitably, sure, it's reasonable to treat them as noise, suppress if you want and move on.  But if you just disagree with them, whether they have a good point or not, turning down their volume is a judgmental and degrading thing to do, and it serves no good purpose... and ironically, it leads away from the kind of productive, ""safe"" dialogue that might change someone's mind. In my opinion it's really a bad way to approach it, and even more so if you feel strongly that they're wrong on an important issue."

If someone says that your thing isn't topical, it's probably X019, and most of the time he's right. He's always applied a topicality litmus test to stuff and that's why we don't have a lot more off-topic junk than we do. You want to know why we don't have atheists posting science lessons for Christians, or people posting studies analyzing HIV transmission rates in order to prove that being gay is bad, or very many exhortations to boycott Pepsi because it's made out of dead babies, this is why.  Secular news links regarding the court ruling on same-sex marriage are off-topic in a strict sense, and that's the lens through which he views the issue. I think this is probably a minority view on the mod team, and I think a case can be made that it's a minority view because it would have been better to view it another way. We had a conversation this morning that was pretty dicey because there weren't a lot of mods around and it needed to get done fast because people were starting a revolution in the mod queue, and those who were had strong opinions, but bottom line is that we took down the sticky and opened the conversation.  You guys can be mad at me about that, you can be mad at X019, or you can be mad at someone else, it's up to you. I'll listen to what you say but ultimately we did the best we could with the cards that were flying around the room, and tried to root what we finally did do in at least partial agreement of the people who were there, which is probably the best we could do given that the exploding cigar had already gone off.  We should have been better prepared and we weren't. We didn't say word one about what to do about this, which is funny because we talked for days about what to do about some tiny court ruling we expected a year ago that turned out to cause zero reaction.  But nobody, including X019, is ""afraid"" of moderating this, and he doesn't deserve to be insulted here because he took a line that people disagree with."

brokehugs,3b2c16,drunkenrabbit,12,Thu Jun 25 16:17:13 2015 UTC,"RSS is a Hindu nationalist organization(or Hindutva). The crux of Savarkar's(the founder of this ideology) Hindu nationalism is that a person's religious faith must have an indigenous origin.Also,Hindu nationalists are concerned with the strength and unity of Hindus as a political community rather with their forms of worship.So...other Indian communities of different religions usually get accused of divided loyalty to the country all the time.For them,there are traitors,but there are are no apostates(like there may be in Islam/Christianity).   Now,Congress was the party which ran the country for quite a long time,and it got embroiled in a huge number of corruption scandals,combined with slow economic growth,led it to be booted out of power completely,being replaced by the Hindu nationalist BJP. A lot of their supporters,interestingly,seem to be atheists who seem to be concerned about 'our culture being destroyed by foriegners'(it is actually valid,though I consider them woefully misguided in their solutions).  The corruption in the church hierarchy in that local region is just used to stick it to the Christians there....  Also, /u/ur2l8 is right. Those American Protestant missionaries(Gospel for Asia is one of those species) are fucking horrible predators. They do nothing but rudely insult Hinduism all the time(I see them calling Hindu deities snake-and-phallic demons),and even calling native Indian Malankara Orthodox Christians as satanic snake-worshippers. You can imagine the anger amongst locals of all religions right?  Note:Hindu nationalists usually make exceptions for communities like St. Thomas Christians and Indonesian Muslims and Jews."

It's semi-Pelagian if you think people have the natural ability to respond to God's grace, without that grace first influencing the possibility or capacity of producing such a response.  Arminians aren't even semi-Pelagians- they think God's prevenient grace is given to all men, giving them the capacity to have faith. Without such grace, men would not have such a capacity."

No evangelical pastor anywhere will ever refer to a physical means of receiving grace because that's somehow being ""works-oriented"". Like, you can't receive grace through the bread and cup because that involves physical action. Hugging your grieving friend can't be an outpouring god's grace because if you hadn't acted, that grace would not be received by your friend.  I've grown up being told that grace is exactly a mystical force that God zaps you with, Thor-style. It's made a real blind spot for me as I've been researching theology outside my own upbringing."
brokehugs,3akfan,Agrona,1 point,Fri Jun 26 16:19:27 2015 UTC,"Like, you can't receive grace through the bread and cup because that involves physical action.   Yep. Same thing with baptism which becomes entirely concerned with the actions and decisions of the baptizee, not the actions of the baptizer or the name you're being baptized into. Oddly enough, though, this logic is suspended for Scripture. In my experience, evangelicals think it's perfectly normal to say that God speaks through Scripture, using that as a physical means of grace. Why does God interact with us using Scripture as His instrument but not the Sacraments? Dunno. But I've always found it inconsistent."
brokehugs,3akfan,PaedragGaidin,1 point,Mon Jun 22 12:31:44 2015 UTC,"Scripture serves as a handy catch-all for evangelical mysticism. It makes sense to me because evangelicals are true Gnostics, and it's not hard to frame the biblical text a sort of compendium of arcane secret knowledge.  That's one reason they are so intoxicated with young earth creationism, climate change denial, faith healing, spiritual visions, etc. they want to believe scripture has secret mystical knowledge about reality that eludes science.  If you want to make an evangelical's skin crawl, try to get them to visualize the point in time and space when the words of Genesis were penned by a living breathing scribe."
brokehugs,3akfan,funny-original-name,2,Mon Jun 22 13:36:43 2015 UTC,"Interesting. Could it be that Baptism is that means of grace that allows people to respond?  Hmm. But that doesn't quite cover adult converts. How do adult conversions happen? What physical means of grace is extended to them that they might accept God? It seems belief comes first in this case, and so there is some invisible Grace. (Perhaps evangelism from the Church?)"

This verse has (rightly) been used to defend equality between men and women for centuries. Theologians have written books on imago dei. It's pretty widely considered that being made in the image of God is what makes us human. It's the difference between us and animals. It's what makes us children of God.  So to say that maybe only men are made in the image of God, you're suggesting that women are literally subhuman.

It's doing the opposite of making a division between men who are made in the image of God and women, who aren't.  If I say that I ate my entire lunch today, my fruits and my veggies, all things both nutritious and sugary, it would be ridiculous to think I meant that I had lunch and then later had fruit and vegetables. It's an expression.  Also, for a religion which has thought a lot about the ways in which men are the head of women and Adam is the head of mankind and Jesus is the head of the Church, it shouldn't be a weird grammatical I-need-to-go-get-my-Hebrew-dictionary moment to say that Adam being made in the image of God serves as a stand-in for all people.

One of my science heroes was absolutely legendary myrmecologist and Harvard professor Edward O Wilson. His study of self organizing behavior is really unparalleled.   About 5-6 years ago, he started quietly blogging about some racist stuff about genetics. Fortunately, I think it was too technical to catch much public interest, but I was absolutely devastated. Like, crushed inside.  Now, has EO Wilson always been a racist? Maybe, deep down. Maybe he just had the hold over of very blatant institutional racism that pervaded during his ""prime"" years in the academy.  But consider. He, like Tim Hunt, is old. He's much older than Hunt, but still, neither one is a spring chicken.  In Wilson's case, most people think there's a far less sinister explanation than that possibly the world's greatest living invertebrate biologist had become a secret Golden Dawn sympathizer: Dementia.  What Hunt said was inexcusable, but I wonder if anyone close to him knows how he's doing mentally, because this kind of thing feels sort of familiar to me, and it's an angle they haven't talked about in the press.

Either way, like I said, very bad, and he should have had to resign those positions. One of the things that happened with Wilson when he went nuts is he basically had to retire from public life.

brokehugs,3a8313,_watching,8,Thu Jun 18 18:14:06 2015 UTC,"Not to be that guy, but...  You can't get a really solid condemnation of slavery out of scripture. The NT, especially the epistles, shows us that all races/genders/nationalities are equal under God, and that slaves and masters are both equal under God, and had best keep that in mind in their behavior towards each other.  But it's not outright abolitionist. The strongest argument that you can make is that slavery isn't a positive good that we're required to practice, and since it's always open to abuse, then all things considered we're better off without it. That's not immensely satisfying or in line with modern mores, but trying to stretch it to say more roams into bad theology and bad exegesis.  I'm not fully defending everything the user in question said (and they seemed to misunderstand the nature of ANE slavery in a few ways), but that's the truth.  Edit: punctuation"

brokehugs,3a8313,drunkenrabbit,7,Thu Jun 18 07:18:16 2015 UTC,"And I feel this is the best argument against the extremist Sola Scriptura attitude. Because you can see in scripture that ideas about slavery were changing, within the Church, but the canon ends before the dam broke on that issue. If the Bible is supposed to be this eternal infallible document, there should be no loose threads at the end. There shouldn't even be any major changes of ideas or debates within the text. But they're everywhere.  Slavery is a weird problem because the clear Christian stance is a logical evolution above the clear Biblical stance."
brokehugs,3a8313,we_are_sex_bobomb,2,Thu Jun 18 12:10:33 2015 UTC,"See, that's the kind of theology I worry about, because when you start seeing trajectories in scripture and making arguments about ""logical evolution"" you can extract almost any message you want.

brokehugs,3a8313,Thomist,1 point,Mon Jun 22 04:52:31 2015 UTC,"I don't think this is out of character for early Christianity though. I'm not even sure you can avoid it if you want to; at best you can do it without realizing you're doing it. The canonization of the Bible is a fixed point in history but the world and the church are hurdling forward in time. That doesn't mean scripture is outdated, but the culture that birthed it is long gone.   Jesus dropped a pretty huge theological/philosophical bomb on humanity and we only have the beginning of the fallout of this recorded in scripture. The rest is found in church history.  And that doesn't mean anything goes, in my opinion. It should be something we wrestle with."

brokehugs,39i39j,Kidnapped_David_Bal4,13,Fri Jun 12 02:30:43 2015 UTC,"I'm typically troubled for two reasons:   The perpetual virginity of Mary doesn't exist in a vacuum. It's coupled with the sinlessness of Mary, which  I find cuts against the ethos of the Incarnation as a whole if the story of God becoming a Man and making His dwelling among us instead becomes the story of God becoming a Man and dwelling with super sanitized people who you are unlike. Plus, the implications of tying these things together is that sex is gross and wrong and defiling, even for married couples. Marian dogmas in general really are doctrines of men, and I while I think the perpetual virginity of Mary is an allowable belief and is more probable than not, it's not a teaching which should be a required belief. Yet many beliefs about Mary are, on the basis of historical precedent and because a guy with a funny hat tells you."

I've read that claim myself several times, most recently in the otherwise excellent post by /u/Im_just_saying above.  But it's just not true.  Consider this passage from Calvin's commentary on Matthew 1:25:   25 And knew her not This passage afforded the pretext for great disturbances, which were introduced into the Church, at a former period, by Helvidius. The inference he drew from it was, that Mary remained a virgin no longer than till her first birth, and that afterwards she had other children by her husband. Jerome, on the other hand, earnestly and copiously defended Mary’s perpetual virginity. Let us rest satisfied with this, that no just and well-grounded inference can be drawn from these words of the Evangelist, as to what took place after the birth of Christ. He is called first-born; but it is for the sole purpose of informing us that he was born of a virgin. It is said that Joseph knew her not till she had brought forth her first-born son: but this is limited to that very time. What took place afterwards, the historian does not inform us. Such is well known to have been the practice of the inspired writers. Certainly, no man will ever raise a question on this subject, except from curiosity; and no man will obstinately keep up the argument, except from an extreme fondness for disputation."

Also, they openly reject the idea that for something to be good it has to correspond with good ends in some sense as ""hedonism."" Its hedonistic to point out that because nothing is wrong with something, and people like doing it, and for some of them its anguishing to avoid, that that means you shouldn't say its wrong. Because obviously its more faithful to know morals correspond to nothing but God's whims, rather than any of the things that make sense for them to be about."

They very much can and often do accuse it of being ""hedonistic"" to point out that no suffering of any kind is caused by it, and people's natural orientation is to do it, and so they need a good case to say its still wrong. They are the ones who are in the wrong trying to stop something nothing is wrong with based on arbitrary gibberish."
brokehugs,394b30,GoMustard,1 point,Wed Jun 10 02:17:33 2015 UTC,"But isn't it interesting that such a phenomenon happens only in this situation? I'm sure they wouldn't consider it hedonism to point out e.g. that no suffering is caused by eating ice cream and people are inclined to do that, so if we want to say it's wrong, we need a good reason. Perhaps you are glossing over the actual reasons they have for opposing it (like at least prima facie Scriptural evidence, traditional opposition of Christian communities). It seems disingenuous to claim that there's just no reason at all to believe what they do, because then you (1) can't explain why they believe this, and (2) aren't productively participating in a conversation, but just ranting."

I'm referring to one very specific phenomenon they do where they struggle to understand that people explaining that there's no tangible effects to something that are bad is a good case for it not to be wrong, and insist that its radical libertine hedonism to think this way. I don't get why you're trying to talk them up. If they didn't use bad arguments ever, they wouldn't be against homosexuality. Of pretty much every moral ""dilemma"" this is as closed of a case as there's likely to be, since there is no serious case against it. That some people don't like this reality since it contradicts traditionalism, and so profess fringe gibberish is neither here nor there."
brokehugs,394b30,Geohump,2,Wed Jun 10 04:10:53 2015 UTC,"No. I know that they have other arguments, and that all of them are bad.    Ok then. I guess we just disagree on that point, because I don't think a line of thought that is so easily dismissed (regardless of whether, in the final analysis, it comes out being true or not) would have endured as long as it has. e.g. I disagree with David Hume on a lot of things and think he can be pretty weak at times, but I am not going to say he's ""bad"" because he's captivated philosophical imagination for quite a while, and many smart people have seriously engaged with him.   I'm referring to one very specific phenomenon they do where they struggle to understand that people explaining that there's no tangible effects to something that are bad is a good case for it not to be wrong, and insist that its radical libertine hedonism to think this way. I don't get why you're trying to talk them up.   I suppose I'm confused because your original post that I responded to seemed a bit less clear - the quotation I originally made suggests that ""nothing is wrong with something, and people like doing it, and for some of them its anguishing to avoid"" is a sufficient condition for ""you shouldn't say its wrong"". Now you are saying that the appearance of the first of those three conditions and the obtaining of the next two makes a good case for it not to be wrong, and good reasons are required to counteract that. I don't disagree, but that remains in the arena of the prima facie and can't be the final word like I thought you were originally saying.   If they didn't use bad arguments ever, they wouldn't be against homosexuality.   In any event, I only care to defend those who are against homosexual actions, not homosexuality simpliciter, because morality is about choices. I certainly think the moral case for assigning blame for an involuntary disposition is weak.   Of pretty much every moral ""dilemma"" this is as closed of a case as there's likely to be, since there is no serious case against it. That some people don't like this reality since it contradicts traditionalism, and so profess fringe gibberish is neither here nor there.   Aristotle seems to disagree (NE 1148b25-34), and I don't think he can plausibly be construed to be upholding traditionalism, given the Greek attitude regarding this issue. Please be charitable - you might disagree with others, but many of those people may well be seeking the truth as earnestly as you are, merely happening to come to different conclusions."
brokehugs,394b30,cheese93007,2,Wed Jun 10 04:49:44 2015 UTC,"Aristotle seems to disagree (NE 1148b25-34), and I don't think he can plausibly be construed to be upholding traditionalism, given the Greek attitude regarding this issue.   Aristotle also had a lot of other wacky ideas that turned out to be wrong, like his theory that the heart was the center of the nervous system or that some people are naturally slaves. I personally don't hold his opinion in very high regard."
brokehugs,394b30,lower_echelon_peon,3,Wed Jun 10 08:16:17 2015 UTC,"He also lived 2300 years ago, so it's expected that his knowledge of empirical science wouldn't be the most developed. Especially since he kind of invented it, so everyone who worked on it more came after him. And inventing logic didn't hurt. But I guess this redditor knows better than one of the certainly top 10 minds in Western history.  That said, the point of the counterexample wasn't to show that he's right but to show that not everything in opposition to homosexual acts is reducible to traditionalism, because Aristotle's issues with homosexuality would not likely be related to that."
brokehugs,394b30,dolphins3,0,Wed Jun 10 09:23:59 2015 UTC,"I don't think a line of thought that is so easily dismissed would have endured as long as it has.   Medicine and social theory weren't good enough until modern day that people could think all sorts of things had bad aspects they didn't. To say nothing about developments in ethics. Considering that the idea that slavery should definitely not be done wasn't mainstream until like the 1900s, your implication here is bizarre. I mean, this is if anything the opposite of the truth. The fact that the idea lasted a long time under a veil of ignorance, but struggles in modern day is a reason to consider it suspect.  And I do give people the benefit of the doubt. Unlike liberals, I don't think people sit around trying to be actively malevolent just because they admit they hate certain people for no reason. But the fact that they may be well intentioned doesn't make their position okay. That would be a weird form of relativism. In the end, we have to find a nice way to help erode their damaging ideas without causing them an existential crisis from losing their traditionalist paradigm. But either way its a real thing we have to do for the good of the future. For instance, I think words like ""homophobe"" and ""bigot"" should not be used since it turns people into villains by trying to represent them as actively evil, and it only exists because the people using it want to spite them and shame them for being wrong."

Because to conservatives that's letting two feet in the door already, and once churches change after that will be just a formality. Which to be fair is kind of true, but down the line, and not for the same reason. Its just that once a few generations pass where its obvious to everyone that there's nothing actually wrong, if they even still have rules against it churches' positions will erode to on paper only that close to no one takes seriously other than in the most fringe groups. And most will be too embarrassed to even keep that around. Cue people who have never even looked at a book of ethics in their life assuming they're a dichotomy between the eternal completely true traditionalist biblical interpretation versus culture that's decided by nothing more than A gay orgy where they cover themselves in ink and have it on top of a large sheet of paper to decide moral laws."

The problem is that him doing this was him doing it.

Often while we're being physically assaulted, disowned by our families, or on political ads used to deprive us of our legal rights. Yet the anti-""bigot"" brigade didn't lift a finger to stop that. But suddenly their views of heterosexual supremacy are being described as bigotry and they have an aneurysm. I think they're bigots. They think my family is a perversion against God and that I'm going to hell. Okay, good. Glad we have that settled. Nobody is happy with that arrangement. But we've had to grin and bear it for most of history. They can deal with a little unpopularity too.  I don't use ""bigot"" as a debating tactic, nor do I tell the bigots in my life that they're bigots to their faces. That's just rude and unproductive. But I do not feel that I'm morally obligated to be a good little faggot who falls in line and is given my right to exist (kinda) in exchange for excusing those who hold me in such low regard as ""merely having a disagreement of opinion.""

Since x hurts nobody but those involved, don't outlaw x, just don't do x.  That is a MUCH more legit argument.

I used to post on that sub, knowing that largely consisted of a reactionary, super right-wing crowd (a surprising number of SSPX sympathizers, Michael Voris types), as part of a personal effort to make the sub reflect more of what mainstream Catholicism looks like.  Ever since I made a post there about the Catholic Church's position on Judaism since Vatican II (namely, that God has not revoked the ""Old"" Covenant) and was met with consistent hostility (with the approprobation of most mods - I was in contact with them in the wake of the whole matter), I've not returned.  I can deal with wrong and antiquated attitudes about a variety of things, but that particular issue is an enormously important one, and the vitriol that /r/Catholicism has toward the Catholic Church's official teaching on the matter is genuinely scary stuff.  That sub is a dumpster fire, and as a committed Catholic I'm embarassed by it and more than a bit scandalized that anyone uses it as a measure of what Catholicism represents.

Eh. This is disingenuous in two ways. The first is that its not representative of the larger catholic population, since many of them simply don't take vatican traditionalism seriously. And the second is that its not on paper because on paper the ""official teachings"" try to word things neutrally. They obviously really think homosexuality is bad enough that it cant be done under any circumstances. Which means that you either have to assume that they think there's a reality that surrounds this which justifies seeing them this way, or they unrepentantly think so while admitting there's nothing in the real world that makes it true.

I'm not quite getting the relevance here.   Priests can be wrong, too. We see this a lot lately, especially when dealing with sexual ethics.   So if the trained minister who has a Master's or PhD in Catholic theology finds nothing wrong with trans people, it's obviously him who's wrong. Notice the lack of catbot references - there is no official teaching anyone can actually cite.  What I especially like is that this person is a convert - OP transitioned first, and then converted to Catholicism. And this is how we treat people who willingly enter into our Church? Nobody ever congratulated her on her conversion, or even tried to welcome her into our faith community - everyone just went straight for ""I reserve the right to judge.""   And there's absolutely no reason for any of those comments to begin with. OP was talking about being patient and understanding with trans people in general, and everyone turns it into a personal attack on her and their God-given right to judge trans Catholics (no seriously, look at all the context-less verse-dropping). And she already transitioned before she converted, it's not even like telling her that you disagree with transgenderism is going to to change anything. But of course, smug self-righteousness is more important than mission and community.  Watch how long it takes before there's yet another post about how the reason more young people don't convert to Catholicism is because our Church is full of wishy-washy V2 liberals who spend too much time strumming guitars instead of telling people how depraved they all are."

That's why it's written on the hearts of Gentiles, that's why men are without excuse, that's why idolatry is so useless: it's worshipping a created thing rather than the Creator who made that thing. This giving up of natural relations to be inflamed with lust for one another then remains as a separate and additional example of the anti-creational aspect of sin, not just an extension of idolatry. There are many ways to practice idolatry without having temple prostitutes. There is no way to make unnatural relations natural or creational. Paul mentions that even women do this. There's a magnification there which I don't know how the ""temple prostitutes"" idea can account for (maybe it can, I'm more open to that possibility than pt 1, I just don't know enough about temple prostitution to say). It seems strange to narrow the scope to temple prostitution if Paul expands the scope to women as some sort of example of how this is an especially obvious sin. There's another magnification where these shameful lusts come as a consequence for idolatry. Why say that idolatry is bad, but this is worse if the ""real"" reason why homosexuality is bad is that it's done by idolatrous temple prostitutes?"

They convince themselves that morals are so incomprehensible that even if they have every reason to consider something wrong, that they are at risk of hell for so much as vaguely questioning a tradition, because if its a sin its a sin and that's absolute. And they defend this irresponsibility by saying that God is so smart that if God says something its right. Which they seem to not realize that the issue here is that if its not right, then God didn't say it. No one thinks god did say it, but that its still wrong. But they use this weird defense to avoid having to consider that any part of something they think might not be true.   life sucks because the guy was now doomed to a life of celibacy and it wasn't even his fault. Like, how can you not see that your teaching is the only thing keeping him from being happy in another relationship?    Yeah. My parents had a family friend who lived a terrible life for this reason. They had several kids with some guy. But this guy after having kids decided he'd rather be single and didn't like kids. So he left her and moved in with some girl a lot younger than them. (I think at this point they were both still mid thirties, but this girl was like 20 at the time.) He cared about his kids so little that even though he lived in the same city, he apparently didn't visit them at all in the next like 17 years. He just cut off all contact. But the mom, despite still being young, was convinced that it was her religious duty to never marry or date again. So she just lived poor for the next few decades trying to both work and pay for kids. (I don't even know if he paid child support) And the worst of all is that when they were like getting past fifty, this guy and his new girlfriend eventually broke up. Since she was still young and wanted to go out and do things, but he was old and wanted to settle down. And only then, did he decide that since he was old and finally got ""done with"" being free that he wanted to have a family, and went back to his wife. And the kids were all adults who knew he didn't care about them before, and refuse to talk to him. But the mom was convinced that this was the restoring of their ""true"" ""eternal"" marriage, and so it was correct for her to think it was good to have him back, and his kids should forgive him.  Now, -I- would represent this story as a horrifyingly bad result of taking obviously bad precepts seriously. But my parents, being rabid traditionalists still present it as if its an inspirational story because it shows that even though her life was hard she did ""what was right."" And it boggles my mind that anyone can actually look at this story, and assume that its actually true that it was right to subject all her kids to this deliberately in favor of some abstract sense that you can only have one true marriage, and always need to return to it, even literally a solid decade after it ended, and the other person showed that they didn't care about it in any realistic sense. It makes you wonder how little these people actually think about morals that they don't even bother asking what it is that makes something right other than ""God says so,"" and so asking how this was actually the better solution. And it never occurs to them the moral epistemological issue of not really trying to asses the morality of anything, and not caring whether their assumptions are bad.   Even Jesus himself said ""except for infidelity"" in his prohibition on divorce.   I think another problem is that they focus too much on the ""Jesus is God so everything has to be derived from throwaway lines in the gospels"" and less on the fact that Jesus was actually pretty pragmatic. More or less implying that when traditions are wrong, you need to throw them away, to try to restore the ""true"" goodness that they should have been trying to get to. And that it was practical, and logical. He didn't just give a list of commands. He made thought experiments to show people how to determine if they were obviously wrong about something. With the assumption here being that even religious leaders have to be done away with when they are. Yet after not even a few hundred years it was back to tradition and rigid hierarchy that you had better not question, even if they have obviously dubious morals. And why not, lets throw on the idea that the traditions literally can't be wrong, too. Just in case Jesus comes back and gets uppity again, trying to break down traditions that were taken in a wrong direction."

If ultimately good and evil are so alien to us that they have no bearing on what actually makes the world a better or worse place, then it all becomes rather pointless to me. Why should I care if ""Good"" wins, if ""Good"" isn't actually good in any practical way. How can someone who believes that say that God is good and actually know what they are saying?"
brokehugs,37ysde,bunker_man,2,Sun May 31 23:39:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah. The problem here is that the people saying this often literally think that ""good"" has nothing to do with making a better world in any tangible way. But that its some kind of abstraction that is about personally doing ""correct"" things regardless of it improves anything. Which gets weird when they reveal that they simply never thought about what they think it actually means to be good then. And actively say strange things like in a world where everyone was good everyone would make so many sacrifices that it would make the world worse. Where they're ignoring that making sacrifices by being good is meant to be to make it better for other people. Not to burn resources for the fuck of it."

Right, and pretty much all their moral arguments, I hate to say it, are post-hoc rationalizations. They were originally devised that way because the dogma came first, but it's reflected in the way they teach it too, since they tell you ""this is what the church teaches"" (if they get that far since a lot of people don't even know their own religion) but rarely if ever tell you why, even the official canned answer why, they teach it. There are tons of people who will oppose gay marriage or divorce or whatever, any issue that the church tells them is important they will defend, but they don't even know why they're defending it. And if they come up with reasons why it'll be from their own little bubble so they only know strawman counterarguments if they know anything about the other side at all, other than ""rah rah we're great you suck"". They assume that because they took a leap of faith into the religion (or were just raised in it) that that means your learning stops there and they can never be wrong about anything again.   But my parents, being rabid traditionalists still present it as if its an inspirational story because it shows that even though her life was hard she did ""what was right.""   Yeah, this is by far my biggest problem with deontological ethics. Even ignoring all the detailed philosophical objections, just the human element screams to me that so many applications of it are missing the entire fucking point of ethical systems. The rules exist to make life better and to teach people not to do things that hurt other people, life doesn't exist so we can follow some rules and get a cookie at the end. Hell, some traditionalists still hold to the Kantian view (although they claim to hate Kant) that you can't lie under any circumstances, even if there are Nazis asking where you hide your Jews, but somehow equivocation and mental reservation with intent to deceive are okay. Like what? That's the biggest example of following rules for the sake of rules while at the same time defeating the entire purpose of the rule that I can think of.   Yet after not even a few hundred years it was back to tradition and rigid hierarchy that you had better not question, even if they have obviously dubious morals.   Yeah, the comparison of modern Christian leaders to the Pharisees is getting stale at this point, but that doesn't make it any less true. There are a staggering number of people who read the Gospels worshipping every damn word who at the same time manage to miss the entire point of the wider passage or story or whatever and focusing waaaay too much on JESUS IS GOD SO THIS THING HE SAID IN THIS SITUATION IS ABSOLUTELY UNIVERSALLY APPLICABLE AND IF YOU DISAGREE YOU'RE GOING TO HELL. They have no problem hand-waving Jesus almost advocating stealing from your boss because that obviously wasn't the point of the story but when he says he doesn't know when the world will end they go off on how he knew it in his divine but not his human nature (what happened to the hypostatic union?) to rationalize it because that doesn't jive with the homoousios. TBH I think that tendency is very hard to avoid in any religion with any degree of organization that claims to be the answer to the meaning of life. The people who are more serious about it and invest more time into it are going to like rules more and also be more quick to condemn people who aren't like them. I don't know if there's a catchy phrase for that pattern but it's extremely common."

Yeah. A lot of people tend to forget that just because some comparisons get stale doesn't mean they're wrong. Sometimes its because they're right, but the people the comparisons relate to are so unrepentant about it that no amount of comparison will ever help them see, so it keeps getting done. The funny part is how overt the ad hoc rationalizations are. Like when they pretend that anti sex natural law is still a serious theory when its not, and only really is still around as part of history of philosophy, and because religious people keep using it. The leaders know its not well defended. They don't believe it because they think its well defended. They believe it because its literally the only even vague way to try to crowbar any existing theory into something they can be correct in without throwing everything to the wind and saying God decides things arbitrarily based on no standards, and all that matters is listening.   Yeah, this is by far my biggest problem with deontological ethics.   Yeah. I think this is a problem with deontology in general, but the religious element really takes it into overdrive. They will simply try to uphold things that even in deontology are not easy to defend, but insist that some principle makes it okay. An added interesting part about this is that even when they claim to understand religious pluralism, and that they can't assume that other people have to accept that they're right, they are faced with the reality that their morals are still based on this assumption. Its an epistemological issue where the amount of doubt there is combined with the fact that in real theories they are wrong means its not acceptable to actually push these ideas, even within your own group (Which they try to justify using strange relativist arguments), yet despite vaguely claiming to understand the faith element, morally treat their dubious ideas like proven matters of fact. Because they simply want their religious tradition to be considered a matter of fact rather than a metaphysical possibility. And they don't like the fact that its not this obvious."

Exactly, at least on my part. Like I said in a comment above, I haven't gone there often, but when I have, it's seemed a place with a very narrow and restricted view of things from a Reformed perspective, namely a place where a (mostly) Reformed Baptist, strictly credobaptist, anti-Catholic attitude prevails. If that's not representative of the views of most /r/Reformed users, I apologize, but that has been my impression on my infrequent visits. From what I understand, the Reformed tradition is much broader than this, and encompasses infant baptism (which Calvin himself encouraged) among other things.   And this situation, if indeed it's as I have presented, is not unusual; I think niche denomination subs aren't very good at representing a broad spectrum of their tradition. When I was a regular at /r/Catholicism (over two years ago), the place was dominated by a cadre of radical traditionalists and political ultra-conservatives, which is not at all representative of Catholicism as a whole. For some reason, these subs tend to draw a particular subset of adherents.   On the other hand, just as with Catholics (as opposed to /r/Catholicism), and Reformed Christians (as opposed to /r/Reformed), I've had many good conversations, and friendships with a wide range of Reformed Christians, including Baptists, Presbyterians, CRCers, and others online and in real life.   Also, I've seen in this thread (and the one linked) several accusations that /r/Brokehugs folks are unwilling to engage /r/Reformed people in serious and constructive dialogue. Let me ask you this: why should I, a devout Roman Catholic, want to engage in serious dialogue in /r/Reformed? Would I be welcomed there? Would I be able to defend and explain the beliefs and practices of my Church, and why we believe those of Reformed Christianity are in error? Would I be allowed to defend and explain the Catholic interpretation of Scripture, and why we believe the Reformed one is wrong?   I would ask the same regarding any other Christians who are not from the Reformed tradition.  If such things are not welcome in /r/Reformed, that's perfectly fine. We all deserve a safe space to talk amongst ourselves without having to answer views we consider incorrect and offensive. As long as we don't keep our intellectual or social interactions solely in these safe spaces, they are a valuable addition to our life. But, it would not then be appropriate for the folks of /r/Reformed to come here and complain about us not engaging in dialogue, if we would, in actuality, be prevented from doing so."

But what I found here was just a bunch of glad handing all based on a false premise. Some users here learned that they were misreading the post, but not until after I showed up to engage.  So, I definitely enjoy discussing anything with anyone and I even protect those under the heavy hand of the mods, and everyone in /r/Reformed knows I am a troublemaker that enjoys discussion with all. I was almost banned with my ""Should the Jews have been credocircumcists"" post and have had my share of posts deleted.

Then explain your more detailed reply http://np.reddit.com/r/Reformed/comments/37guol/seems_like_we_havent_been_very_loving_and/crnthkm   I honestly did not make a connection between the two.   Yeah, so you claim ...   What I am saying is is that once a new category of Christian can be carved out based upon a person's evil proclivity, e.g., gay Christian, then the peder-jihadis first objective will be complete. There will just be those who have a sexual proclivity to children but are Christians. This will lead to more and more acceptance.   Oh look, we've got a slippery slope argument!  Acceptance of any other groups you consider bad (like Teh Gay) is leading to acceptance of Pedobear-Christians!  Won't anyone think of the childrenz!!!!!!1!!1!   I am not implying that it starts with gay and leads to pederasty, though that may indeed prove true, but it is beside the point I am making.   And then you deny your gay->pedo connection by continuing to try and tap dance around it with your hiding gays in a grouping.  Trying to add an extra layer of indirection and obfuscation with ""Acceptance of any part of Group X (which includes the gays) leads to pedo-acceptance"" is still the bullshit of ""acceptance of the gays leads to pedo-acceptance.""   We need to just be aware that what disgusts us today can find its nose under the tent real soon. And a good example is what we see with homosexuality; but not saying one necessarily leads to the other.   Then you end with empty general platitudes that can apply to anything."
brokehugs,37ns7r,BSMason,-6,Fri May 29 17:36:07 2015 UTC,"Oh look, we've got a slippery slope argument!   We do, but not slippery slope from gay to peder, but rather from softening a resolve against any hint of pedophilia to acceptance!  And it is easy to make the Biblical case that softening in our resolve against sin leads to more and more of it.  Take the increasing giving over to sin in Romans 1.  But to suggest that the argument is ""if you accept gay soon you'll accept pedophilia,"" then you are just plain wrong; that argument just isn't there.  You really are having difficulty reading.  To make an analogy is not to suggest causality.  I've claimed no causal connection between acceptance of gay and acceptance of pedophilia, no matter how many exclamation points you use.    Trying to add an extra layer of indirection and obfuscation with ""Acceptance of any part of Group X (which includes the gays) leads to pedo-acceptance"" is still the bullshit of ""acceptance of the gays leads to pedo-acceptance.""

brokehugs,37ns7r,lower_echelon_peon,6,Fri May 29 09:52:25 2015 UTC,"The problem is that it's a bad analogy. If you want to compare homosexuality to something, then use something that's actually reasonably comparable, something that involves consenting adults. If you think it's a sexual sin, then use a comparable sexual sin. Don't use pedophilia or bestiality (which involve victims who are unable to consent), or murder or rape (which always involve violence). Those things are fundamentally different than any kind of sin that involves knowing, consenting adults.   A better example would be adultery, or possibly divorce. But, no, people keep using pedophilia, bestiality, and murder as analogies to homosexuality."

brokehugs,37ns7r,BSMason,0,Fri May 29 12:00:34 2015 UTC,"I'm not comparing homosexuality to anything in order to say something about homosexuality.  I am discussing pederasty and using the change of attitudes toward homosexuality in the church, how that occurred, and where it led, as a case study in what can and may happen with pederasty.  The analogy works because acceptance and normalization of sin in general follows this path.  The pushers of peder, who are out there, will infiltrate the church's consciousness by first making a seemingly valid point, like with the homosexual debate, that it is just some folks' besetting sin.  Next there will be a push for a new category, e.g., Christian Pedophile (I don't think that phrase will actually be used, but the concept will exist), just like in the gay debate. Next we will be allowing practicing pederasts to be church members, so long as they are trying to get better, like it occurred in the gay debate.  Etc., etc. You see, I am only using homosexuality as an analogy and am in no way saying that one leads to the other.  And the discussion's focus is not homosexuality.  I've taken it for granted that we've failed there, I've observed how I think it occurred, and I see that a similar path could occur for even more egregious practices, and we shant pretend it is impossible for the normalization of pederasty to occur.    Also, it might be helpful to note that my original post was done right after and during a bunch of posts on the Duggers and other high profile cases.

Doesn't that strike you as strange that I have this weird knowledge given I haven't even had a reddit account - and you can check with the admin and whomever else to ensure it is in fact new, it's not by cheating or ban evasion I can promise. I know you don't likely believe in things like people sent by the holy spirit. But you can't quite explain how I can know so you jump to physical explanations like ban evasion because you don't like spiritual ones. Just know I'm not the only one being sent.

brokehugs,37g2wf,bunker_man,8,Thu May 28 09:53:16 2015 UTC,"It depends on what you think ""always right"" means. Most Catholics take it to mean ""without error in doctrinal matters of faith and morals,"" recognizing that in Catholic teaching there's a difference between the Church and the humans who make up the Church. There are bad priests and bishops. There have been many bad popes, who have made stupid political decisions, started wars, indulged in all manner of vice, and used their office to settle old family vendettas or advance their earthly wealth and power. There have been scandals and other horrors sown by human sin. None of that makes the Church, or her leaders when speaking for her, incorrect on doctrinal matters of faith and morals.    That's what most of us Catholics mean when we say ""the Catholic Church is always right."" We don't mean ""the pope is always right"" or ""the priests are always right.""  Rad trads on the other hand take ""always right"" to mean ""without error in doctrinal matters of faith and morals plus unimpeachable personal holiness, following [insert their particular brand of secular politics here], and a dedication to [insert their pet liturgical style or culture]."" They want the Church to return to a fantasy version of the 1940s (or 1870s) that was never real. They look at the past and see perfection where it never existed. They look at the things they hate in the modern Catholic Church (Vatican II, the Novus Ordo Mass, ""liberal"" papal statements condemning political, social, or economic causes they hold dear, etc.) and they think ""but wait...if the Church is always right, and these things are wrong...then maybe this is not the Church anymore, or maybe evil people are in control and need to be cast out.""  It's a leap of reasoning that leads some to go into outright schism, and others into paranoid conspiracy theories about secret groups controlling the Vatican. The thing they don't seem to understand is that every single Christian church has leaders, clergy, and lay faithful who are evil people doing sinful things in the name of Christ. No church is immune to this, not even their own, loathe as they would be to admit it. It's always been that way. The Apostles were sinners just as much as we are today; that doesn't change their spiritual offices.   Rad trads don't get that. They think they really are more Catholic than the pope. It's literally Donatism, and it's just as stupid and prideful now as it was in the third century."

brokehugs,37brgu,shannondoah,15,Tue May 26 13:38:38 2015 UTC,"Good gravy, the sedevacantism is strong in this thread. First, a known sedevacantist True Catholic™ says,   /r/Catholicism has always been anti-Catholic AFAIK.   (ahahahahaha...)  When confronted about his schismatic shenanigans (he went so far as to call Pope Francis an ""Anti-Catholic"" and ""heretical antipope"" which...is just hilarious), he said,   In kind, I respectfully ask that the derogatory and inaccurate (among other things) term ""sedevacantist"" not be used to refer to me.   i.e. the technical term for my beliefs vis-a-vis the Catholic Church is ""derogatory"" and ""innacurate."" Dude...you think the Diocese of Rome has been held by antipopes for the last sixty years. That qualifies as sedevacantism.   Then we come to the expected ""Ireland is no longer TrueCatholic™!!"" comment:   Christ has not and will not abandon His Church, but it is not a farfetched concept for most of the Church to abandon Christ. One look at Ireland would back this up. There will always be the Church, but that doesn't mean she has over a billion followers.   ...followed by typical schismatic-apologist language about Vatican II and evil Protestants:   Something here doesn't sit right. The Protestant reformers all sought change. Many of them tried to destroy the Mass, eliminate the sacraments, divorce their wives, abandon the priesthood, et cetera. Sedevacantists are very much the opposite. The watched modernist reformers wreak havoc on the Church in the spirit of Vatican II and rejected this change. They jumped to conclusions that you and I may not have (i.e. sedevacantism), but they didn't change anything. They don't reject the papacy or the sacraments. They reject the papability of the man in the Chair of St Peter and his reformed Mass.   No, sedevacantists like homeboy up there very much do reject the papacy. They hold Vatican II as an evil invalid council that taught heresy, and they justify this by retconning John XXIII into an antipope. They do this not because of the abuses done ""in the spirit of Vatican II"" (which really happened, were all too extensive, and in some ways still need to be corrected), but because they disagree with the council itself. The abuses didn’t start until after the council had concluded. They're no different than the Catholics who went into schism over papal infallibility and Vatican I. They accept the papacy and the authority of the Church only until they run up against things that harsh on their personal Jesus, and then they conveniently say ""well [x] pope is an antipope anyway."" It's ecclesiastical sour grapes.    And they do reject the sacraments. They dismiss the Novus Ordo Mass as being invalid. In so doing they deny that the Eucharist as practiced by over a billion Catholics is really the Body and Blood of Christ. They follow men whose priestly and episcopal orders were, by and large, illicitly conferred by bishops in schism from Rome. They, like Marcel Lefebvre himself was, are paranoid conspiracy theorists who see evil Protestant/Masonic/Communist/Modernist/Liberal cabals lurking behind every corner, out to destroy TrueCatholicism™. They're basically Donatists, and Donatism was condemned as a heresy a very long time ago."

brokehugs,37brgu,smikims,8,Tue May 26 20:57:29 2015 UTC,"Remember when /r/catholicism had a discussion about whether homosexuality is worse than rape?  There are some gems:   homosexuality was so widespread within Sodom it was common to all the men in that town.   They all must have caught the gay from the drinking water.   There's your problem. If you have nothing more than your own feelings and opinions, then you don't have anything. Morality is objective, not subjective. Your personal feelings on which is worse are kind of irrelevant. What matters is actual moral philosophy, actual theology. Built on something deeper than ""I think"". Which is why Aquinas' position demolishes yours - his is based on something real.   What's Aquinas' position again?   Some Church Fathers, including Augustine, and later St. Thomas Aquinas, would have ranked homosexuality as 'more disordered' than rape.   Oh.   But, your purple prose aside, yes. Homosexuality is a greater sin.   Finally, straight talk.   frugalninja is a homophobic fucktard who uses religion to justify his bigotry   Some more directness.  There's also a courteous discussion about whether it's acceptable to lie to non-believers by saying that homosexuality isn't worse than rape. ""it is not your duty to speak truth at all times.""   But again, it is like comparing which painful way of dying is ""better"", being stabbed by a rusty knife or by jagged shards of glass. Both are pretty Shitty. In the eyes of the Church, homosexual intercourse and rape are both pretty shitty practices.   Perfect analogy comparing homosexuality to both rape and death by stabbing.  I have to stop now."

I mean, we Orthodox don't even officially deny that the current Pope is the valid bishop of Rome.  We've never done that.  We're just not in communion with him or his flock.  Some will try to say it's about heresy.  The heresy nail is rather flimsy, in my opinion, but there are differences that have evolved in the last millennium that need to be inspected by learned people in order to determine if the situation remains just a schism and not a result of a fundamental disagreement about what we believe.    Basically, we should remember that Christ's Church moves in centuries.  If it's a schism that does not result from difference in belief, it will be resolved one day."
brokehugs,37brgu,fr-josh,8,Tue May 26 18:28:33 2015 UTC,"How do these guys think Vatican II is going to be reversed? I mean are we just supposed to wait until a new fake pope gets in and sees the light, reverses it, and is then re-popified as True Pope?  Or are they just going to have their own churches in eternity which basically makes them Orthodox-lite?"
brokehugs,37brgu,allamericanprophet,7,Wed May 27 03:40:16 2015 UTC,"From what I've heard, they want either a soft or a hard reset to 1962 (or 1958, depending on which pope they choose to antipopify). The soft reset would mean declaring that Vatican II was not an ecumenical council, isn't binding, and taught errors that need correction. (Catholics who don't go schismatic but still hate Vatican II commonly argue along these lines. It takes a bit of mental gymnastics, considering that John XXIII's letter officially calling for the council explicitly called it an ecumenical council, in direct line with the 20 preceeding ones.) This is, of course, not going to happen.   The hard reset would mean the Vatican officially saying ""oops, we done goofed,"" recognizing one of their guys as pope, and completely sweeping away Vatican II and every reform that followed. This is about as likely as Pope Benedict drop-kicking Francis off the papal balcony and declaring the Koran to be the true New Testament.    Most of them also want the Novus Ordo to be completely destroyed and the pre-1960s liturgies enforced on the whole Church."
brokehugs,37brgu,PaedragGaidin,9,Tue May 26 18:34:13 2015 UTC,"Just to give a little more context on where the crazies are coming from:  There was a council, II Ephesus, that was explicitly declared as ecumenical.  Its findings were enforced upon the Church for many years.  However, another council, II Nicaea, was the entire church, not just the Vatican, but Constantinople, Alexandria, Antioch, and Jerusalem as well, saying ""oops, we done goofed"".  As a result, II Ephesus is called the Robber Council of Ephesus.    That's the basis on which the crazies say that Vatican II can be undone.  That said, Vatican II didn't really say much about the teachings of the Catholic Church, but really addressed practical issues.  There's just no way you're going to hang the bishops of Vatican II on the gallows of heresy.  They didn't teach anything new."

brokehugs,37brgu,PaedragGaidin,10,Fri May 29 23:01:12 2015 UTC,"I think they think there's going to be a solution like the Council of Constance (which ended the Western Schism by basically kicking out all rival claimants to the See and electing Martin V): A new Council which will denounce the old ""bad"" one and elect a true pope to replace the current antipope(s).  Who they think has the authority to do that is anyone's guess. I suppose the current ""antipope"" in Rome would have to resign, and then the bishops (led by the schismatic ones, presumably) would gather to convene the council. But these guys are almost to a man ultramontanists, and believe a Council can only be convened by the pope. So we circle back to ""who is the real pope?""  In reality they know none of that is ever going to happen, and so the hardcore ones are just going to stay in schism and keep drifting further and further away from any hope of reconciliation. The same as happened with the Old Catholics."

The rest, no kidding, was filled with co-workers, friends, church members, and just random people she'd talk to once or twice a week when she visited a certain store or organization.  The funeral went on for an extra hour because so many of these people wanted to share how brightly she shone in their lives.   It moved me deeply, because there were people from all walks of life there. Grandma was Christian - Episcopalian - and I remember hearing the crap she would get from my more conservative family members about her being close to some of these people.  I don't know if I'd be who I am if grandmama wasn't around to be that example for me. She, to me, was the ultimate example of Christ's love in this life.  So. I don't get it, either."

I feel like I hang around a lot of non-Christians and nominal Christians without it affecting my faith much (except for a few issues like swearing, and formerly irresponsible use of alcohol), but some people just can't handle it.  The problem is when people apply what they have to do in their life to everyone else's life without qualifiers.  What might be the best decision for you might not be the best decision for someone else.  A big consequence of this, however, is that people tend to raise their children either in the isolationist or non-isolationist mindset without much regard for how their children actually deal with that sort of thing.  Some children you have to steer away from certain other children; some children can hang out with whoever they want without letting it effect them.  You have to be discriminating."

I experienced this a lot through high school--it was a fear of being wrong. I was afraid that if I read too much non-Catholic stuff I would eventually be convinced by it, so I made sure to stay away. When you read something that's the complete opposite of your current beliefs (which have to be right) and it starts sounding reasonable, it can scare you pretty good."
brokehugs,377h1s,smikims,1 point,Tue May 26 23:52:51 2015 UTC,"I agree with you to an extent- But how does one share their faith with others if they do not have relationships with others outside of their church community. I am not talking about anything too radical- just sharing life with neighbors, co workers, et cetera. I know this is a difficult thing for some as it is difficult for me- I am ""on the spectrum"" (millennial white male on reddit, go figure) so a lot of social interaction is anxiety inducing... But I make an effort to get to know people and help in my community. Paul says :    When I am with those who are weak, I share their weakness, for I want to bring the weak to Christ. Yes, I try to find common ground with everyone, doing everything I can to save some.   I think a correlation one can draw from this verse is that we are uniquely situated to influence others for the sake of the Gospel. I am a carpenter, I work 10+ hours a day with tradespeople- I have opportunities to build relationships with these people... Someone who is a college professor or an IT tech are going to have different people in their sphere of influence. I want to make a disclaimer that I am not talking about building targeted friendships- so that if someone I am building a friendship with rejects Christianity I am going to drop them and move on to the next ""project""  As to the swearing- A lot of that is a contextual thing... as I said- I am a carpenter and there is language that is acceptable and communicates in the context of a job site that is not appropriate and would cause offense with older people at church. I don't sweat it too much.  With the bubble theory in families- I have really seen the shit hit the proverbial fan with families that overly sheltered their children and kept them in an artificial bubble and all hell broke loose when the kids had no external forces exerting control over their lives... That said, every family dynamic is different and every child within that family is different. Part of parenting is preparing your child to face the world outside their doors- I like what Craig Gross said (in response to the whole Duggar debacle - but it applies across the board)    This is the biggest one to me, because it feels like much of this whole thing could’ve been avoided through some honest conversations. Look, you’re not going to be able to shield your kids from the world – it’s just the way it’s going to be. Plus, avoiding the topic of sex or sexualization in our culture is just going to turn it into forbidden fruit and make it all the more tempting.  So don’t. Quit trying to build a world for your kids that doesn’t exist and instead start teaching them what it means to be a Christian in the one that does. Teach them how to be a force for good, how to reject what our sexualized culture tells them is normal, and, most of all, what sex is all about. Does that make you uncomfortable? So what? Your kids are counting on you, so get over yourself and do it."

He could not falsify Himself; what, then, was God to do? Was He to demand repentance from men for their transgression? You might say that that was worthy of God, and argue further that, as through the Transgression they became subject to corruption, so through repentance they might return to incorruption again. But repentance would not guard the Divine consistency, for, if death did not hold dominion over men, God would still remain untrue.   Or, from Hebrews:   Indeed, under the law almost everything is purified with blood, and without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness of sins. - Hebrews 9:22   You can't claim that the author of Hebrews is a bad Jew or that he's a PSA extremist."

It's one thing if your non-PSA theory of the atonement can make sense of all the biblical data. But when you deny that Jesus died for our sins, or that his death was sacrificial, you demonstrate that you're not so much interested in being faithful to the bibilcal witness as you are to not sounding like an evangelical.   I think the real controversy is not whether Jesus is a sacrifice, but rather who he was sacrificed to. Was it sinners sacrificing God to appease Himself, or was it God sacrificing Himself to sinners?   I'm not up on the specifics of mimetic theory, but I think the aspects of it that you've mentioned (Jesus having been murdered by sinners, God willingly handing himself over to be killed to reveal our sinfulness) can be assimilated pretty well into a penal substutionary model. In fact, it's been my experience that PSA usually comes with a strong sense of personal culpability for Jesus' death. The difference between ""Jesus was murdered by sinners"" and ""Jesus suffered the righteous punishment for our sins"" is really not that great. Jesus died because of our sins. His death was something we did to him."

If, on the other hand, we see Christ’s sacrifice as the same kind of sacrifice a loving parent makes for a child, then the sacrifice isn’t Godward–it is instead a selfless act to accomplish something. And the “something,” in this case, is the doing away with sin….He sacrificed for us. Or, as the writer of Hebrews says, ‘He put away sin by the sacrifice of Himself’ (9:23)”   I'm not sure if this post was referring to me, but my intent was to state that God didn't sacrifice Jesus for us, and we didn't sacrifice Jesus to appease God, and God didn't sacrifice Jesus to appease himself.

brokehugs,36jeus,bunker_man,19,Wed May 20 02:59:52 2015 UTC,"Yeah. Some catholic arrogance tends to be pretty staggering in its worse manifestations. Common examples being these:   ""Quote from that one bishop where he said that no one disagrees with church teachings. Only what they think the church teaches. If they knew the real teachings everyone would be catholic.""    I'm pretty sure that people actually disagree with questionably thought out ethics that are upheld with ""But we can't be wrong,"" when it comes to light that they are fringe ethics positions that are not defended well.   ""We have thousands of years of developed traditions. That means if you disagree you're wrong, and following modern culture!""   Minus the part where some of these traditions involve assumptions that were never challenged, but were rationalized post hoc, and which like the above case involve building on ethics that aren't supported. Something being old doesn't make it automatically right. In fact, there's a good change it means its wrong, especially if questioning it openly was never on the table, or like homosexuality it also ties in to that as recently as a few hundred years ago they also thought it was behind most disease, much less just disrupting the social order.   Rigorous use of the words objective, rational, and things you associate with young atheists.   Atheists might be wrong, but at least you can understand why they use those words. (Unless they're moral relativists who think morality doesn't real.) With Catholics its just confusing. Since they struggle to explain why they refer to objectivity as assuming they're right whether or not they have good arguments.   We buried every empire! We'll bury the empire of thinking homosexuality is okay!   This one is not only cringeworthy but borderline offensive. Since it phrases it like they're some force that endured endless onslaughts when what they are actually referring to is a history that for most of it past the very early roman days they were a force that actively persecuted opponents, and was the power that spanned multiple states. Enduring for most of that time other than the very beginning was not impressive, and was actually tied to a lot of immoral things they tolerated or sometimes did themselves.   Natural law; teleology. These are totally well supported real ethical theories that explain why homosexuality is wrong!   No. That argument isn't even considered a real argument anymore in ethics, other than as a historical novelty it helps to know was made at one point. You can't try to appeal to philosophy when you're appealing to something philosophy more or less crossed off, but insisting that because an argument was kind of made for it, that that + catholicism can't be wrong proves its a good argument. They also get annoyed when you point out that it involves appeals to nature. And explain that that's not what natural law means. Even though it does in fact include appeals to nature.  I think those are the big ones. They are all recurring things that really need to stop."

Which by extension means that anyone who does disagree must be willfully choosing to be wrong."
brokehugs,36jeus,Decayde,7,Wed May 20 03:17:31 2015 UTC,I never thought about it that way before. Now it makes sense why my old church was always preaching that atheists are self-hating lunatics.
brokehugs,36jeus,bunker_man,5,Wed May 20 03:34:39 2015 UTC,"And the worst part is that they present all of this in their schools as absolute fact and don't even acknowledge that other viewpoints exist. The only philosophy, moral or otherwise, I learned through high school was based on Aquinas and Aristotle, with maybe a mention of Plato's existence to show that he was wrong and Aristotle was right."
brokehugs,36jeus,gaycatholicaway,8,Tue May 19 22:09:24 2015 UTC,"Yeah. They try to justify it by insisting that having been around a long time means their traditions are so developed that any possible mistakes were gone through, contrasting it to ""modern philosophy"" which is apparently a guy dressed in pink who taped a pen to his dick and did the helicopter over a piece of paper until he was sure its content was sufficiently hedonistic. Therefore you can't disagree til you read hundreds of books explaining moral theories that aren't actually considered serious theories, the books of which aren't considered to have much use outside of their traditions. The irony of course is that pretending that this has anything to do with the work put into the traditions is basically a backup plan to fall back on even though the real reason is that they just assume they're incapable of being wrong, which means it would be bizarre to even consider anything else.  Which is kind of literal. They make sure to announce that they don't really get ethics by responding to any argument pointing out that there's reasons for people to want to do some things, but none against them (homosexuality) by insisting that its ""hedonistic"" to think that morality has anything to do with their happiness mattering. Apparently this also means anyone who thinks that matters thinks morality is subjective, since their happiness matters. Which means its objective to not care about that (???). Apparently its way indulgent to think that morality in any way corresponds to not causing needless suffering just to uphold very vague rules about what some people before the creation of ethics as a field in ancient days decided was unnatural because they though it was disgusting. And the fact that their one tenuous argument has no weight, and even if it did its still being contrasted with an overwhelming other side apparently doesn't need to be factored in. The moral epistemology here is lacking.   The other irony about them hating Plato is that historically its suggested that identifying God with being the ideal representations of all good qualities, especially goodness itself was inspired by Plato's ideal forms. They just really love substance, since apparently this is necessary to make communion work. And you need to move past plato's idealist shenanigans to make sure people know that things just concretely are and have substance, and form, and order, and that's why you'd better not put your penis near a man's asshole."

Yep, once the magisterium is infallible everything is basically just a post-hoc rationalization of anything and everything they proclaim to be The TruthTM. And if the doctrine changes they'll just say ""well that part wasn't infallible anyway"" e.g. with religious freedom (formerly called the heresy of Americanism, now the most important thing evar) and usury (now called our entire financial industry).   They just really love substance, since apparently this is necessary to make communion work.   I honestly think that's the biggest reason they only accept Aristotle and no one else.

I'm a bit reminded of a quote from MLK Jr that I read last night -   It has been my conviction ever since reading Rauschenbusch that any religion that professes concern for the souls of men and is not equally concerned about the slums that damn them, the economic conditions that strangle them, and the social conditions that cripple them is a spiritually moribund religion only waiting for the day to be buried.   Now, obviously this doesn't wholly apply. As the comment points out, the Catholic Church does a lot to help, just apparently not for these specific folks.  Also obviously, as an atheist I really don't have the right to order around religious folks, and am tired of atheists doing so.  That said -  If I were part of an organization dedicated to helping people, and someone was angry with me for utterly failing to help them, I would do my best to look beyond the irrationality of the situation and to try to understand. None of the logical or theological arguments in the world matter when you're struggling to get by, to most people. And as someone who would want to optimize the amount of help given by my organization, I would try to listen to their concerns and glean from them some way to prevent the problem in the future.   To me, that's what acting in love is all about, not this tough face of ""Well, tough luck for you, you're choosing wrong. So irrational. smh"". I see completely where that reaction comes from, but idk... hardened hearts? Meh. Probably reaching. Again, total not Catholic here, so I'm probably missing something."
brokehugs,36jeus,Salivific,5,Wed May 20 07:17:36 2015 UTC,"This was basically the primary reason I didn't decide to go with Catholicism when I was denomination shopping (alongside a couple doctrinal points and social issues like homosexuality).  Growing up, I was offered the possibility that maybe different denominations can fulfill different individual needs: maybe some people need the emotional worship experience of a charismatic church, or the accessibility of Lifechurch, or the elaborate and rich liturgy of the Catholic Church, or the intense focus on scripture of the Church of Christ, or the extreme theological liberty of the Disciples of Christ, depending on what's happening in their lives--and this was in the Church of Christ, which has historically...not been particularly ecumenical.  I would nowadays heavily criticize a lot of the sentiment there, but at least it taught me to respect other traditions and understand that other people can fully appreciate Christ in other denominations.  The Catholic response--and not just these ultratraditionalists, just the default Catholic response--to other denominations is to, at worst, label them all heretics and shun them or, at best, patronizingly recognize them as Christian but not actually the Body of Christ.  I mean, I completely understand their position, but it's just so...arrogant."

It was bad enough during Christmas and spring break, but summers? Oh my Lords of Kobal, summers sucked so bad. I always felt sorry for the admins...none of whom were around at 2 am when, predictably, a bunch of young idiots would come into the chat and spam the screen with the n-word. It was probably even worse on the big sites of the time (Dragonmount, Wotmania, Theoryland...all except the first of which are long since gone).   Us? We were a small, close-knit community, little known in the world of WoT fandom. Wtf, didn't these kids have anything better to do on break than dick around on small literature fan sites?

And OP was trying to stir everyone up in the initial post, and everyone flipped.  Would you cough up your own son on Facebook to random people including his best friend?  No parent I know would do that.  I wondered, could I concoct such a screenshot myself?  It turns out I couldn't- because my Facebook is actually connected to other people, which causes numerals to show up down the left hand side that this guy didn't have, most notably beside the word Pictures.  What normal Facebook is connected to people who have no pictures?  Is OP in some sort of Amish enclave that allows Facebook but forbids flash photography?  Well it turns out that people create troll facebook accounts to mess with people.  And the simplest explanation is that OP made a post in his troll facebook that's not connected to anyone, blackened out his portrait and name in MS Paint, and fired it into the mother sub.  When I posted, ""this is a bunch of crap, where are the numerals down the side?"", someone reported me and the mods deleted my comment, ""because it didn't fit the theme.""  What theme is that, the ""all Christians are stupid laugh at them"" theme?  What are we supposed to think?

Someone makes a post about differentiating religious marriage from secular marriage, and people still use it as an excuse to push their viewpoint. That isn't even what the thread topic is about, people!  Not to mention the wave of condescending arguments that follow:   all of those who claim to be Christian yet support homosexual marriage are not Christians at all. They are false Christians. They may go to church, they may be nice people, but they are not born again. They're not Christians at all of them. They are lying to you   Prerequisites for the True ChristianTM faith: 1) Belief in the Resurrection, 2) Belief in the Trinity, 3) Believe that gays, including non-Christian gays, should not be able to marry   There are plenty of people who used to be homosexuals but I'm born again. They've been cleansed from their homosexuality. Jesus Christ can cleanse a person completely from homosexuality. He can set them free not only from the ex but also from the desire. It's going to be determined by how much you believe what God says he can do.   This is just willful ignorance, the standard ""I'm not disagreeing with science, you're disagreeing with God"" response. A homosexual can live a celibate life if he/she chooses, but there's no valid evidence of gay conversion therapy working.    As a Christian, what other sin do you support ?   Try substituting this with any other sin that isn't illegal.   ""I'm against premarital sex but don't think we should outlaw it.""  ""As a Christian, what other sin do you support?""  ""I'm against blasphemy, but don't think we should be locking up atheists.""  ""As a Christian, what other sin do you support?"""

A lot of the problems when talking gender-sexual issues is that conservatives can't or won't accept progressive terminology.  It's hard to argue your point when people aren't talking the same language.  But, I'm not sure this is a great example of this.  This conception of the term ""gay"" has been around for a while and has in my useless anecdotal experience already seeped into conservative thought.  I rarely hear people bashing homosexuals, the rhetoric is shifting towards ""active homosexuals,"" and in between these two points people talked about ""the homosexual lifestyle"" for the longest time."

Someone says something hateful towards gays, and the pro-gay folks fall over themselves saying something hateful about the anti-gay folks, thinking that somehow their own statements of hatred will improve the situation. The gay issue is often compared to the civil rights issue, but Martin Luther King did not go on a name-calling tirade, though he certainly had the right to do so. He chose a better way, and so should we.   So, you strongly disagree with your father on this issue. Ok. But your dad also did a good enough job to get you where you are, so careful on the ""bigot"" talk. He's still your dad.

That is his right and I, as his son, do respect his beliefs and convictions.  What angers me is when beliefs turn to actions that harm others and end up being against the very gospel they preach. I am specifically against the denial of a child from learning the gospel and being a part of the church based on any characteristic of the parents. It's a child. They don't know about any of this debate, they didn't ask for it. If a child wants to come, it is the duty of the church to welcome them with open arms. That is straight from the words of Christ himself.  So it isn't my father's position that edges on bigotry, necessarily, but rather this entrenchment of a position deep enough to refuse a good to those who are innocent.

brokehugs,35ap4x,wcspaz,10,Fri May 8 20:01:24 2015 UTC,"I reject IQ as a realistic standard of measuring human intelligence, and I reject the notion that certain academic fields inherently draw more intelligent people than do others. An IQ test is good at measuring how well people do on IQ tests. That pretty much goes for every kind of standardized test.  Very few lawyers, for example, think that someone who scored a 160 on the LSAT is actually more intelligent than someone who scored a 150; they were merely better at taking the LSAT and more geared towards the particular mental challenges it presented. No lawyer I've ever met thinks someone who scored a 169 on the bar exam and didn't pass is less intelligent or has lower potential to be a good attorney than someone who scored a 170 and passed. It's all arbitrary.   Math and science people are smart at math and science. It doesn't mean they're actually smarter than, say, a librarian or a social worker.   If that makes me a stupid drooling history/polisci yokel, so be it. :P"
brokehugs,35ap4x,VexedCoffee,0,Fri May 8 21:29:36 2015 UTC,"So we can discard the IQ discussion, as it doesn't matter whether or not different majors have different IQs, but it is clear and obvious that different majors draw different types of people. Some majors draw people who are really good at understanding STEM, while others are good at engaging emotionally with people. And when the people who are really, really good at STEM (like the physics folks) hear the social workers talk about the importance of their work, the STEM folks can completely respect it. But when STEM folks hear people who don't seem to grasp the basics of the scientific process claiming to be scientists (like many psychology majors), it's hard to keep that same level of respect.  (this is similar to when polisci majors hear others talk about politics, is it not? What do you think when you hear regular folks stating what they think the US should do in Ukraine when you're quite certain those folks couldn't find the Ukraine on a map? That feeling is what STEM folks feel when they hear many English majors talk about science)"
brokehugs,35ap4x,PaedragGaidin,5,Fri May 8 18:45:48 2015 UTC,"See, I agree with you here...different kinds of people are intelligent in different ways.  What annoys me is when people say that one of those ways is superior or more ""useful"" than another."

You'd need to approach the matter in a much more civil manner.  It's like if I wanted to make a point critical of African Americans, but I started out with ""The problem with you niggers is..."".

First of all, let me start by saying I find the theological viewpoint espoused in the comment to be offensive and wrong. I don't like it. Having said that, it is a doctrinal viewpoint that many denominations have held for many, many years; like it or not, it is a facet of the broad gem that we call Christianity. We can argue about it and debate it, but since it is a theological issue, it is not our job as the moderation team to police that.  Second, the comment was actually on-topic for the thread. It's not as if the user jumped into a thread celebrating a Catholic baptism and starting calling the pope the Antichrist; the thread was about ""When do you think the Antichrist will appear,"" and the user chose to give his or her opinion on the matter - an opinion, again, that has a long history in Christian tradition that you and I personally don't like.  I was one of the mods originally pushing for its removal, and then I realized that the main reason I was pushing for it was because I didn't like it. It's a theological position. It was stated as a theological position - even though the position itself is offensive - in response to a theological question. We might not like that position, but it is not our place just to remove stuff because we don't like it. Some theological positions in the broad scope and history of Christianity are going to offend people. Be offended; I was. But the mod team is not the theology police, and I don't think it ever should be. If the answer to the question ""Is this view, even though it is offensive, held by a significant portion of historical Christianity?"" is yes, and the answer to the question ""Is this view, even though it is offensive, presented as a theological issue in a thread dealing with said theological issue rather than an off-topic personal attack?"" is also yes, then we should not remove it.

My understanding is that we have that rule in place because while we discourage bigotry, there are going to be views within the broad category of Christianity that many might view as bigotry, but are historically legitimate doctrinal positions. It is not our job to modernize such views; /r/Christianity is a place to discuss the faith, and some members of the faith will be holding to older views regarding Christianity. The rule is in place to prevent insults (in, say, a completely off-topic thread or a prayer request thread), but still allow those who genuinely hold those views to be able to state and, if they so choose, defend their doctrinal positions."

It is not our job to modernize such views   In other words, you discourage illegitimate bigotry. That's a big difference, since just about every bigoted view out there can be theologically/historically justified unless we're writing off the SBC.  Yet the sidebar simply says ""Bigotry"" the same way it does ""Spam"" and ""Harassment"", which lack a theological exception. This confuses people (such as LuluThePanda in the link here) into thinking that polite, theologically sound bigotry is treated the same way polite, theologically sound spam is. It's not. And that misleads/disappoints people and implies that the ""many [who] might view as bigotry"" are officially wrong, and it isn't bigotry to think black people bear the Mark of Cain because LDS history makes it OK.   Which is why I think the sidebar should say something more like  ""insults (in, say, a completely off-topic thread or a prayer request thread)"""

""Non-Christian Bigotry"" (Clearly shows the divide between legit/not legit, so that people saying ""Personally I think all Asians are mentally handicapped"" can't hide behind a lack of slurs. But this might encourage the use of theological slurs since it implies acceptance of ""Christian Bigotry"".

I understand that other people also claim that, but they are wrong, as determined by reading, not by personal feelings. Scripture is not so obscure that we need people to tell us what it means- Paul wrote to churches and was read aloud. This is not ""he said, she said"", this is ""he said, she said, and he is wrong because he contradicts Paul on the subject of justification.""  Furthermore, as a layman, I hold no authoritative teaching office. I cannot set myself up in God's temple as the man of lawlessness can in 2 Thess 2. All churches have a doctrine of the Antichrist or of the Man of Lawlessness. They must- it is addressed by Scripture. It is not a basic smear or ad hominem."

Or do they want no bigotry? You can't have one or the other, because bigotry is (sadly) a crucial part of many Christians' faiths.

From the /r/trees FAQ:   Originally everyone used to hang out at r/Marijuana. One day the mods issued a new set of rules about what belonged in the subreddit, and encouraged the mellow stoners to report any of their compatriots who broke them. That didn't fly with the peaceful people, and one of the mods (Sabbetts) resigned, leaving only b34nz. b34nz started banning anyone who A) pointed out what an ass he was, and B) discussed starting a new community. Upon investigation, people realized that b34nz was an asshole racist islamophobic dick. Numerous ""new"" weedits were created in the aftermath, but only trees stuck. And thus, here we are today.   It takes something seriously upsetting to get people to relocate and move a subreddit like egregious moderator abuse (literally banning people for disagreeing, trying to profit off the subreddit etc, discovering your mod is literally a racist etc.)  Because people look at a subreddit for content, and when you make a new subreddit and start getting it off the ground it has little content.

For a start, bring back appropriate warnings and banning for people who are there to make trouble.  Said bans should not take weeks to bring about.  Bring back the old community policy, but fix it (many improvements were suggested) instead of the giant and convoluted current one.  De-bureaucratize the system, allow mods to be good caretakers for the sub.  Remember that it is a sub primarily for Christians to talk about Christianity (Yes, I know that may sound funny coming from a non-Christian), and hold the non-Christians to a higher standard than they have been in a long time.  There are a number of people there with clear nefarious intent that have simply figured out how easy it is to avoid the policies.

brokehugs,33ylr9,_watching,11,Mon Apr 27 12:48:51 2015 UTC,"You get this a lot in pre-WWII history too, tbh. People are generally really unfamiliar with the idea that concepts of romance and sexuality and friendship changed over time, and fairly recently, so you get a lot of American presidents and soldiers being described as probably bi because they basically told a dude ""man we're such war buddies <3 :)"" at a time when that was more standard.   Idk how it was that far back, but given the authors of these texts clearly not being the most friendly towards man on man action, I'm gonna assume this is a similar case.  Side note it'd be rad to bring this back, I want to have a soul-bound comrade in arms but all I get is chatting with bros between classes :/"
brokehugs,33ylr9,blue9254,10,Sun Apr 26 23:30:18 2015 UTC,"Some of it is warranted; until fairly recently there was a tendency to sterilize or otherwise dismiss any notions of romance/sexuality between people of the same sex, particularly men and particularly those who are heroic in some way.

brokehugs,33ylr9,_watching,5,Mon Apr 27 00:37:41 2015 UTC,"1) well if it was just about that it'd still be interesting. I mean, I would be pretty interested to find out that Abraham Lincoln was into BDSM or something. You might as equally say ""well how are any figure's eating habits interesting"" but we study those things too, because...  2) mostly it's less about the person and more about the erotic tendency. So again, if we found letters from Abraham Lincoln going ""I like to be spanked and also tied up"" it wouldn't tell us much about the civil war. It WOULD tell us a lot about the history of BDSM. The history of the little bits and pieces that make up culture and society are incredibly interesting, and important to understanding both the mindsets of people back then and also how we got where we are now. A bunch of letters from a famous dude telling us how gay he was would tell us a lot about being into dudes back then.  3)  It's important to remember, as well, that we're not just talking about erotic tendencies. The identity and understanding of homosexuality we have is a recent development, but that's partly because we know now that it's apparently not just a choice made by pervs. And examining how a gay!Lincoln responded to his society and was changed by it would be fascinating.  4) Finally, it's important to remember that the general ""default"" here isn't ""we don't know their sexuality"". It's ""they were straight"". If that's false, it needs to be corrected, lest we ... ""straight-wash"" (i guess) history."

I've seen Yeshua, Yeshoshua, Yahushua, and Eesa.   What is it, really? As I was always told, Jesus is just a Greco-Roman adaptation of Yeshua/Joshua."

There are a lot of people who think that Arabic names are the original ones when they don't know the Hebrew, which is weird and annoying.  Yeshua is the probable original, but it's sorta related to the name Yehoshua.  These two have the same version in Greek, but are different in Hebrew/Aramaic.  Though some of the difference is probably change over time.  Yahushua mangles the name to emphasize the theophoric element in it.  Yeshua sorta obscures the theophoric part of the name a bit, this one adds it but not to the original name.  Yoshke is a Yiddish term, where you add the diminutive -ke.  So it's sorta the equivalent of ""Joshie"", and is a common way of referring to Jesus in Yiddish."

I mean I have no problem with a congregation of Jews (Orthodox or not) who accept Jesus as the Messiah and simply keep Mosaic Law because Jesus said that not a single iota will pass from the law. I mean like plenty of these people don't seem very Jewish and plenty of Jews see it as appropriating Judaism for Christian purposes and that's true most of the time.
brokehugs,33o246,PaedragGaidin,10,Fri Apr 24 16:37:49 2015 UTC,"I think you just described the main problem most of us have with them. Beyond wacky linguistic hijinks and shitty Bible translations, the Messianic movement seems largely geared to convince Jews to become Christians by saying ""look, you can still be Jewish, just like we're Jewish! Look how we keep Torah and all that!"" and mangling their alleged Judaism in the process, and to make Christianity more ""authentic"" by getting in touch with its ""Jewish roots.""   Like...are you Jewish, and became Christian, and want to keep celebrating Jewish holy days and rituals? That's cool. It's part of your heritage. If you want to keep observing the Mosaic Law, I guess that's ok, as long as you understand that as a Christian you're not required to do so.   But, are you Jewish, and became Christian, and want other non-Jewish Christians to celebrate Jewish holy days and rituals and observe the Mosaic Law? That's not cool, and it's one of the things that the New Testament is actually absolutely crystal clear on. Gentiles aren't under the Mosaic Law. We aren't supposed to follow it. Saying that we are is actually a heresy condemned by the early Church. (And one thing I notice is that, on this point, Messianics will typically say that they don't think Christians are obligated to observe the Mosaic Law, just that it's cool and authentic and we should think about it. But it's pretty obvious that they think you're not doing Christianity right if you don't.)  And, are you Jewish, and became Christian, and want other Jews to become Messianic Jews Jewish Christians (because let's face it, that's a more accurate term), and you try to entice them by playing the part of a totes magotes observant Orthodox Jew who simply accepts Jesus as the Messiah, but have in actuality cobbled together a weird mish-mash of elements that doesn't resemble either the first-century Judaism or the early Christianity you're hearkening back to, and you do this with the aforementioned linguistic hijinks, cherry-picking the Talmud for Rabbinic teachings you like, and other assorted shenanigans? Not cool, not cool at all.   Or, are you not actually Jewish, but you just really really like Jewish stuff because it's ""authentic"" since Jesus and Paul were observant Orthodox Jews (and as /u/namer98 said, that's an anachronism), the kind of guy who leads clueless Christians to hold an imitation Passover seder around Eastertime and selectively incorporates elements of Judaism into their Christian worship and living while conveniently ignoring the other 99% of it, coupled with a typically egregiously bad understanding of Hebrew?

Yet they jump at anyone reading it differently, even though most of them believe things that are as much removed from the tone of what one could assume original christianity, much less consistent with judaism was as the person they're attacking.

Christianity also has rules about what is required to be a Christian. That the sub has a big tent rule doesn't really change the creeds as normative professions of faith.

""Christianity"" can't agree on which authority the rules come from. There isn't anything in common that's ""set in stone"" as you put it. Baptists have the Bible (i.e., the Protestant Canon). Catholics and Orthodox have Scripture, Tradition and apostolic authority (i.e. their respective canons, and their respective patristic writings, and their mutually-excommunicated bishops).   The creeds are 'normative' in some sense only among Christians who confess them. But that isn't all trinitarian Christians by a long shot. Baptists are non-creedal  and rely solely on Scripture as an authority. Some (though not all) might acknowledge the creeds or parts of them as Scriptural, but that doesn't mean they necessarily view them as central to their faith, or as authoritative in any sense."

brokehugs,33bis2,namer98,3,Wed Apr 22 18:50:01 2015 UTC,"I think Christianity is different from Judaism in this respect, and as much as I do admit clear guidelines can be a strength, in this case I like Christianity's approach.    Christianity admits to the contest over its own label.  If you call yourself a Christian, that opens us all to a conversation about what that really means.  A group granting or denying permission to a label is not the important part: the discussion is the important part.    Claiming to be a Christian in complete isolation is indeed similar to your rhetorically calling yourself asian.  But that's never how this kind of conversation takes place.    Claiming to be a Christian is implicitly claiming some position on what it means to be Christian!  Regardless of whether or not it is a logical position, it still comes from a place of yearning that a group can affirm, that then gets broken down and reintegrated through discussion."

Such a person could rightly expect heated discussion every time they claimed to be Asian in a public forum, but in the end it's a sort of natural right to call yourself whatever you damn well please as long as no one's looking.    That's where I'm inclined to see this bickering about terms to be a form of group authoritarianism that I have no patience for.  Christianity has branches with strong doctrinal urges and rigorous qualifications so that everyone within that group can recognize one another.  (A softer term than 'group authoritarianism' is 'organizational tactic.')  Secondly, unlike whatever biological component there is to race, I think there is something in merely wanting to be Christian; perhaps it's that mustard seed."

brokehugs,33bis2,wordsmythe,2,Tue Apr 21 23:57:37 2015 UTC,"Hmm.  That didn't help, it doesn't seem to me to relate to what you said above.    You're saying that your identity as a Jew suffers if someone else says they're a Jew but is wrong?  What about the rifts within Judaism?  Do you agree on every point of Jewish doctrine with every other Jew?    Presumably not; presumably they're ""Jewish enough"" at some point.  You don't let the minor inconsistencies bother you.    For Christians, I would argue that that bar is set extremely low.  I'm in the company of thieves and murderers here, I'm commanded to love my enemies, and this pushes the boundaries of our inclusiveness.  This is the reason for my preference described elsewhere.  (Shouldn't we believe that even the major inconsistencies between people are minor in the face of God?)    What happens when you believe that how other people use your label is important to you is that suddenly your happiness becomes contingent on other people using words the way you want them to be used.    And it's not that I wouldn't assert a few things about Christianity if I ran into someone that claimed they were a Christian and that meant they needed to eat tacos every Wednesday.  But I'm free from the burden of having to forcefully convince Taco-Christian of anything.    On the other hand, if I run into someone that thinks they need to murder someone every Wednesday because that's what Christianity means to them, nothing in my Christianity forbids me from contacting the authorities, and compared to so many of the other things people have done in the name of Christ, I don't feel like my identity is threatened because someone was murderous."
brokehugs,33bis2,namer98,3,Wed Apr 22 00:05:47 2015 UTC,"Sorry about my snarkier response downthread, but I see there are two sorts of issues here:   Semantic arguments over definitions, and Identity arguments over who's in the in-group.   Judaism is an outlier in social groupings in that it has explicit, codified rules about inclusion. Other groupings, like Christianity, have had some rules for some traditions (and those rules have changed over time), but no fixed and widely agreed-upon definition exists in contemporary humanity. Plenty of folks might be willing to offer potential definitions or descriptions of the way they personally draw the line, but that's really more part of issue #2. If we're just talking about semantics, then there is no stable, generally accepted definition. So while we might offer a specific definition to apply within the context of a paper or argument, we have no universal definition to fall back on.   As for identity politics, we all have motives for trying to define who's in our group and who isn't. It's relevant to how we and others see the group. There's plenty of danger there in the way it can play out, but I'll readily admit that it's valid for people to pay attention to what people they associate with. The important thing to remember is that social identity is a different conversation than the semantic argument—rather than a ""what X means"" discussion, it's a ""it's important for me to see these boundaries on X for the following reasons.""   If we can get past the stuff about what ""Christian"" must mean and get to talking about why people desire to draw the lines in certain places, maybe we can have a discussion."

If you were any better than I am , wouldn't there be two sides of a debate represented in the link to the thread I posted?   Call me an intolerant bigot and hypocrite, Im fine with that title.  But if you want to consider yourselves any better than me, you have to ask yourself, in your discussion that I link, why is only one side of the debate represented, what happened to the other side of the debate on the controversial issue in the link I posted?  Why is no one speaking up?  Are you guys any more tolerant of dissent and diverse opinions than someone like me who is probably a homophobic nazi?    And if not, what does it feel like being no better than one of the most hated posters on /r/christian?  At least I can admit I'm a hypocrite.  So if I'm a son of hell, guess that makes you two fold sons of hell, because (1) you are just as bad as I am (2) unlike me you are incapable of seeing or admitting to your flaws.    What you need to do if you want to avoid hell is renounce Christianity and go to the atheist team, because right now, you all have just enough Christianity to dull your conscience and send you straight to hell.  If you were atheists or agnostics you would  at least have a chance at heaven the way dolphin3 has a chance at getting into heaven, as it stands now there is no hope for you Christians because your religion has dulled your conscience and made you evil.  Everyone thinks they are great and wonderful and pure by their own standards, but trust me you are not, because even  measuring by your own standards, you are not even better than me whom you hate and think evil and mad.

I'm not trying to debate you I'm trying to get you guys to see something.  Does your love and tolerance and acceptance surpass mine, and if so why is there only one side to the debate in the thread I posted.  And if your love, tolerance and acceptance does not suprass mine, how can you hope to get to heaven.     Avoid hell by going atheist? That's an odd thing to suggest.   Read scripture, Romans 2 condemns you and gives hope to them.    Romans 2:15  For when Gentiles who do not have the Law do instinctively the things of the Law, these, not having the Law, are a law to themselves,  in that they show the work of the Law written in their hearts,   Atheists and agnostics on that board are probably going to heaven.  If you look at their conduct they are usually respectful or at least ordered in their thinking and acting.  The law in their hearts keeps them restrained.    Now of yourselves read Romans 2:1  Therefore you have no excuse, everyone of you who passes judgment, for in that which you judge another, you condemn yourself; for you who judge practice the same things.   So if any of you want to go to heaven your love and your tolerance and your acceptance or whatever has to at least surpass mine.  And you cant show that because the thread I posted has only one side of the debate.  And you can check again, its the Christians not the atheists or agnostics behaving intolerantly towards dissent.  Its the Christians who have failed to behave more lovingly and tolerant than I have.  Even, Dolphin3 when told he was behaving improperly by attacking Christians and Christianity toned it down and behaved more appropriately and lovingly and tolerantly,  Romans 2 gives him the possibility of heaven.  The Christians however did not respond the way Dolphin3 did.  When rebuked the way dolphin was the Christians responded with even more hate and even more anger and even more scoffing.  Their faith has dulled their conscience, and you can see it by how they acted.  You can see it by how there is only one side of the argument that dares speak in the link I posted (and its not the only one like that I could post more) .  Im not here to win debates.  Just please see the point Im trying to make.   How can you expect to get to heaven, when your love and tolerance and acceptance doesn't even surpass mine, and if it does, how can you explain how only one side of the debate is speaking in the thread I linked."

There`s this saying - when you point a finger at someone, you point three back at yourself.

brokehugs,32d6zj,PaedragGaidin,37,Sun Apr 12 20:27:04 2015 UTC,"I think treating baptism as a thing you do to show off your choice of beliefs is a terrible teaching that ignores every single piece of Scripture we have on the subject and robs consciences of comfort and the Holy Spirit of any power whatsoever.  You know what I do?  NOT POST, ASSHOLES"
brokehugs,32d6zj,Kidnapped_David_Bal4,9,Mon Apr 13 00:45:51 2015 UTC,Yep.
brokehugs,32d6zj,Panta-rhei,10,Mon Apr 13 01:56:40 2015 UTC,"I saw the post and thought ""oh that was little early"" and then I remembered that I thought it would be awesome to get baptized at 10 (possibly earlier).

brokehugs,32d6zj,spacekobra,5,Mon Apr 13 03:18:13 2015 UTC,"I love you, man."
brokehugs,32d6zj,tuigdoilgheas,3,Mon Apr 13 20:17:56 2015 UTC,"This is an interesting point. Some churches treat baptism as a personal thing, others as a very public statement to others. What are your reasons for concluding that the latter is unbiblical? (And I just found this sub. Perhaps this sub is only for meta-comments and not for actual discussion? If so, I apologize for the question)."
brokehugs,32d6zj,M4053946,7,Mon Apr 13 14:23:25 2015 UTC,"The distinction I'm trying to make is not 'my private action' vs 'my public action', but rather 'my action' vs 'God's action'.  Baptism is always and everywhere a passive thing which is done to you. Furthermore, it is not a sign or symbol of something invisible which has changed, it is the thing which does the changing.  We have been baptized into Christ's death (NOT 'baptism shows how we are buried with Christ already'). Be baptized and have your sins washed away (NOT 'baptism represents how your sins have been washed already'). Baptism now saves you, as an appeal to God for a clean conscience (NOT ""baptism represents how you have been saved already invisibly""). Christ cleansed the Church, His bride, by the washing of water and the word (NOT ""the water and word are outer things which demonstrate that the church has been cleaned...somehow"").  If you come from that background, then putting such a big focus on 'my decision, my choice, my profession, my confession, my promise' is to make the sacrament about man's obedience to a new Law, not God extending promises of the Gospel. And that is Very Naughty.  But, hey, it doesn't matter! God is at work even in a very naughty baptism because of a serendipitous inconsistency."
brokehugs,32d6zj,Kidnapped_David_Bal4,6,Mon Apr 13 16:22:56 2015 UTC,God is at work even in a very naughty baptism because of a serendipitous inconsistency.   Someone needs to have that as flair.

But I'm not a parent, it isn't my child, and I'm not doing the baptism, so my opinion is moot."

brokehugs,322vin,Jooseman,2,Fri Apr 10 05:12:44 2015 UTC,"Moderators can see if a comment was made by a shadowbanned account, and make them visible afterwards. You can check yourself by making a comment, logging out and checking if it's visible [edit] I think. [edit2] To be 100% sure, you should check from a machine in different IP block (from which you normally don't browser reddit), with a different OS and a different web browser. Not sure however if the reddit software goes to such lengths to conceal from a user that they're shadowbanned. BTW, I can read you so you should be good :)."
brokehugs,322vin,beatboxing_parakeet,2,Fri Apr 10 05:26:31 2015 UTC,Usually opening a new incognito or private window in your browser pointing to your user page can tell you if you are shadowbanned—your page will say user not found. I know this from experience (got unbanned).
brokehugs,322vin,KiOulixeus,2,Fri Apr 10 06:00:12 2015 UTC,"Well, I wasn't sure if reddit put any additional effort into hiding the fact you're shadowbanned from you. Your method is easier than what I suggested with a comment."
brokehugs,322vin,beatboxing_parakeet,2,Fri Apr 10 06:48:03 2015 UTC,"If you can't see someone's account history page, they've either deleted or have been shadow banned.  The mod of a sub can tell the difference if the person tries to post in the sub after being shadow banned, because Reddit will spam filter what they say.  I noticed that /u/EACCES was shadow banned because I saw him say something in /r/Christianity, and it was backgrounded in pink.  If I see a shadow banned person trying to contribute in /r/Christianity, I tell them, because I don't want our subscribers living in that kind of underworld there. I have no idea if the admins are okay with me doing that."

brokehugs,31zywm,blue9254,4,Thu Apr 9 21:03:55 2015 UTC,"It doesn't. It just demonstrates that Catholics and Protestants alike were quite adept at killing one another, including Protestants who now by and large are opposed to capital punishment.   Example: Anglicans/Episcopalians. Article 37 of the Thirty-Nine Articles explicitly supports capital punishment, but in 1988 the Lambeth Conference condemned it. Very similar to how the issue has changed within the RCC. Our respective churches both once said it was okay, and both now say it isn't.   So to say ""ewww the RCC is sooooooo hypocritical because lookit what they did to Protestants but now they say it's bad"" is, well, hypocritical, when Protestants have done exactly the same.

You can interpret the Bible however you want, but pretending all this nonsense about being LGBT, like that it is a choice, was explicitly condemned in the New Testament, is unhealthy or bad for society or children, is simply not true and is rapidly becoming the psychological equivalent of arguing for Young Earth Creationism or anti-vaxxer. It simply isn't worth respecting as a valid opinion."
brokehugs,31wgtz,smikims,12,Wed Apr 8 20:58:50 2015 UTC,"Flippant christian nihilism is pretty disingenuous as a whole. They think that if they assert that morals are so incomprehensible that no one could even begin to try to understand what types of things are bad without divine guidance, that it reduces everything to a void where any morals not directly from something claimed as Revelation are just opinions that can be thrown out, and thus revelation overrides it. They legitimately can't comprehend that they are wrong, since they think that the dichotomy is either that they are right, or nothing is. And this gives them the idea that they need to cling to this, since they must be a light in the darkness.  But there's nothing surreal or transcendent about bad traditionalism that implies a surreal incomprehensible being came up with it. Its simply very obviously the hangups of past people. Superintelligent transcendent beings shouldn't act like drunk grizzled rural forty-five year olds who think that anything they find distasteful must be wrong."

This x1000. It's the false humility complex a lot of churches seem to breed where obedience to the arbiters of morality is the ultimate good no matter what they say, and you should be judged based on your loyalty to them rather than actually figuring out what's good and what's bad."
brokehugs,31wgtz,_watching,5,Wed Apr 8 22:56:07 2015 UTC,"Yeah. I figured out when I was like 10 that a lot of religious bodies had this weird obsession with the concept of obedience, presenting it as the highest ideal. Religious structures need to let everyone know that regardless of their place in the hierarchy they must always without question follow commands from higher authorities, unless they know that they are sins. And that this extends sometimes to relationships and families as well, with after the family as a whole subordinate to minister, wives subordinate and kids subordinate and that they should listen even in abusive situations. And incoherent stories were presented as proof that it was good most of which it wasn't actually good in. And this was tied with bad logic, like you can only be obedient to god by learning to be obedient to other figures. Despite those connotations being radically different, not to mention its bad to encourage figures who are acting badly by complying with them without question."
brokehugs,31wgtz,TotesMessenger,3,Wed Apr 8 23:14:35 2015 UTC,"And often they don't think to criticize their leaders or become blind to their flaws because they're also taught that ""They know better than you"" and even ""They work in mysterious ways"" like they're also often taught about God. The default position becomes ""They must be right and I'm wrong and I just don't understand why yet"" instead of rationally analyzing things."
brokehugs,31wgtz,lower_echelon_peon,3,Wed Apr 8 23:19:52 2015 UTC,"Religion has a lot of uses, but ""excuse to justify things which would very obviously have no justification if not appealing to exclusively religious logic"" should not be one of them. When things like ""getting remarried has no actual negative aspect (Even if obviously divorce being used trivially does), but God invented an irrevocable mark for the soul of connection once you do it just to justify the conclusion that its bad because it harms your soul in some esoteric way"" are passed off as real arguments, people should sit down and realize that they basically admitted that there's nothing actually irrevocably wrong with what they're trying to pass off as unthinkable.  The fact that people when asking about religion have to consider it an equivalent of what non-justified moral assumptions someone is assuming explains why it is slowly dying out. Especially since worse, many religious people actively realize this, but don't consider it an issue."
brokehugs,31wgtz,InTheSpiritOfElijah,2,Wed Apr 8 23:46:37 2015 UTC,"do you think possibly, just with a little introspection  there might be a contradiction between being calling oneself a christian and thinking God acts like a grizzly rural forty five year old.

brokehugs,31wgtz,PaedragGaidin,0,Tue Apr 14 15:58:24 2015 UTC,"It is possible to try and understand good and evil without divine guidance, but it is not christian to do so.   Just because you profess having a self identified flaw doesn't mean you should project it onto Jesus. Read this, and then stop and actually think about what is being said. This isn't a problem with God, its a problem with people who are themselves flawed, who then spend time developing tradition that justifies many of their own flaws which over time they convince themself is from God. which they then try to defend not as an opinion, but as if God handed it to them directly. Much of Jesus' message was very definitely about why doing that is wrong, and you need to actually simply have pragmatic morals, as he showed how they work, and which you have to do even when it seem religious prescription contradicts. There's very little controversial about Jesus himself presenting this in this way. The issue is that people simply don't like the uncertainty of this, and so immediately revert into assuming that there is no uncertainty, and trying to shift the focus merely into complying with an already existing complete solution to everything.  Its not only wrong, but what is your point? Many of these people legitimately see God as an equivalent to the type of angry drunk middle aged guy you see in bars who rambles completely preposterous things about gays that you then have to pretend to agree with due to literal threats of violence, not because anything they say actually makes sense if you examine it. But who you simply avoid the fact that you believe anything preposterous by insisting that they must be right about everything they say. This isn't really an acceptable outlook on life, no matter whether or not people define it as how their internal system works. And its not even how Jesus wanted people to look at things, so defending it based on pure human tradition that is highly fallible makes it even worse."

I mean, I'm sure there are people who comment here in /r/brokehugs now and then who have gone over the line in similar ways, should we launch an inquisition into everyone's comment histories and permban them from the subreddit because we don't want to be associated with stuff like that? Same slippery slope.

It's not there for shitbirds who post ineffective trolling attempts and then say ""LOL I TROL U"".  Then again, an emotional response is not a bad thing. Even if he is trolling, who cares?

Other Christians do far more and a far better job driving people out of and away from Christianity than the big name atheists.  In one of the nuked threads from the ""I don't think I'm a christian anymore"" post, when one Christian with emergent flair pointed out to one of the attackers that just quoting scripture at someone isn't helpful or productive, the attacker then tells him to shut up as he must really be agnostic and not a Christian for having ""no appreciation of the importance God's word"".  I did a double-take that I wasn't reading /r/sidehugs.  As an outsider, it's fascinating how some of these people think they are helping/promoting their view while they help drive people away from it. I feel bad for the people on the receiving end having to deal with all the crap though, whether in /r/christianity or in real life."

That is what an unbelieving world simply finds unbelievable.""  It's true.  I look at these threads and it's like a reminder, every single time, as to why half of my friends don't believe. Why I still sometimes struggle with doubt.   And it breaks my heart. I see beautiful things happen within the lives of people through small outreach groups of genuine Christians, get excited, go on the mothersub, and just feel my soul get beat back down.   It's just really shameful at this point."
brokehugs,31m55y,beatboxing_parakeet,2,Mon Apr 6 16:17:25 2015 UTC,"I'd say that quote covers part of it, though depending on how you read it is too focused on hypocrisy.  I view it as about the incoherence of the Jesus/God professed from their lips.  When one speaks of love and compassion while using examples of hate and manipulation, speaks of justice and mercy while an outsider only sees arbitrary cruelty and malice, that is completely unbelievable.  It's like something out of an Alice in Wonderland, up-is-down black-is-white world."

I would like to remind people (and myself, since I have made some comments here) of St. Paul's words in Romans 2:1:   Therefore you have no excuse, whoever you are, when you judge others; for in passing judgment on another you condemn yourself, because you, the judge, are doing the very same things."

TC is very small, is geared towards Christians of a more conservative theological bent, and is meant to be a ""safe space"" for Christians. It has 7,659 subscribers (and probably around a hundred regular active users), five human mods (all of whom are active), and the AutoModerator, which does quite a lot of work every day. A fairly tight reign is kept on the sub, as far as its rules are concerned.   Seems kind of apples and oranges to me. I guess the main thing is that a few TC regulars used to be Christianity regulars, but left for one reason or another.

She constantly judges other people. Calling women who dress as she disaproves sluts and women who annoy her bitches.  Truly this it is a vain and self indulgent group who make up much the modern church. A pit of vipers and wolves in sheeps clothing.

brokehugs,31h28j,EvanYork,10,Sun Apr 5 01:58:49 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the response, but I find that answer disappointing. It says:   The Orthodox Church allows remarriage out of mercy and for the salvation of its faithful whose first marriage has died. Alexander Schmemann - a prominent Orthodox theologian - speaks of the ""condescending"" of the Church ""to the unfathomable tragedies of human existence"" when speaking about remarriage and divorce. As such, pastoral economia take into account the fact that Christian people are surrounded with erotic propaganda, urbanization, uprooted ness and a culture that is at odds with Christian values.   I think that's sensible, but I fail to see why it doesn't also apply to same-sex marriage, especially considering Jesus and St. Paul are just as opposed to divorce/remarriage (if not moreso) than homosexual acts."

It's not something I agree with but it's not exactly broke hugs material. It's a common trend in most modern christian analysis of biblical text.   I don't except non-christians to be perfectly versed in Christian theology and I don't expect them not to say things like    I don't trust Luke, Matthew, or John, they were clearly written with an idea of what Jesus meant to them, rather than an objective account of his life.   That is actually a perfectly rational skeptical non-christian take on the gospels. It is our job to show why they are wrong.  You can not apply your world-view to everything and expect the world-view of others to fall into line. Any kind of evangelization must be done with an approach from the world view of the other party."
brokehugs,31g45k,electronicmaji,7,Sat Apr 4 20:31:19 2015 UTC,"What exactly are you complaining about? Paul's teachings and focus are different heavily from Jesus. Note that sola fide types to support it have nothing from Jesus that's not an open misrepresentation of the context, and Jesus was much more clear that works were the point of his teachings. So they go to paul who may or may not disagree, insist he does, insist both are on the same page, and then believe what they want. Insisting that there's not discrepancies in tone or content isn't the standard scholarly interpretation. Its something people just kind of wanted to believe 1500 years ago."
brokehugs,31g45k,bunker_man,3,Sun Apr 5 01:58:34 2015 UTC,"I think the focus on blind reductionism in both cases is a little bit less than honest in representing Paul and Jesus's positions.

brokehugs,31g45k,bunker_man,3,Sun Apr 5 02:15:19 2015 UTC,Hold on a second though. I'm saying that the teachings of Jesus and Paul aren't easily summed up in little one line zingers like Paul is clearly pro-establishment and Jesus is clearly anti-establishment. In no sense other than the broadest generalizations is that true and even then I'm not sure it's really correct. Honest in this case has nothing to do with which you think is right but much more to do with the fact there are not easy delineations. It's a reduction black and white when clearly the discussion is more nuanced than that.

Your thread here seems to be lumping any type of issue along that nature one could bring up together though, and dismissing them as a whole. Your title alone is making a phrase that its trying to imply is ridiculous, but that reflects something that can very well be a large portion of the case. You also handwave the real scholarly issue that the gospels paint somewhat different of pictures. So you are making just as bad of implications as you are critiquing."

brokehugs,315c06,PurpleSabbath,3,Fri Apr 3 00:05:17 2015 UTC,"I suppose so, yes, though I personally can't think of a better way of explaining it. What's vague about it? I'll try to be more clear if I can.  Either way, /u/Boogerstache's point above remains; the fact that we're using metaphorical language should not be taken as license to try to force that metaphorical language into a literal interpretation and then say ""See?! That's stupid!"" Any metaphor or figurative language interpreted literally would become idiotic."

brokehugs,315c06,PurpleSabbath,2,Fri Apr 3 00:19:00 2015 UTC,"Its pretty vague because it basically says that sometimes some feelings you have might be messages from God, and maybe not, and it gives no real good way to know which is which.  Coupled with the teaching that I remember hearing at church, that the human human heart is evil, it's really confusing.  We are not to trust our selfish fallen hearts, and at the same time, listening to our heart is how we know God is real and what He is saying to us.  I guess I see their criticism differently.  I essentially see what they are saying is ""this doesn't make any sense,"" although they are taking it to an extreme and with a mocking tone.  When ""listen to your heart"" doesn't make any sense and people either don't explain what it means or give confusing explanations, I can understand how people might be dismissive as I share in their confusion."

Sure, except that we Christians believe there is a way to determine which is which; if it's buttressed by Scripture, it's most likely of God. Paul even told us to ""test every spirit"" to see if it from God.   We are not to trust our selfish fallen hearts, and at the same time, listening to our heart is how we know God is real and what He is saying to us.   But our mind is fallen, as well. Fallen does not mean ""always wrong."" It means having an ultimately irresistible tendency toward evil. We know both good and evil, which is why we are to seek the good in our hearts (underneath our external actions and speech).   And I totally get that response, especially considering the lack of explanations given. However, my problem with that dismissive tone is that it shuts down conversation; it indicates that the person is no longer interested in the pursuit of truth though conversation and discussion, and is simply interested in ripping apart a person's language by twisting it into something it was never meant to be."

And sure, both of those ideas don't match up with the bible, bit I've never had the opposite feeling in my heart that does loves me that I can match up with the bible.

Fair enough, but the fact that you've never had the experience should not be taken that others have not had such an experience themselves; I suppose when we say that you should listen to your heart, we assume that you've felt or are feeling that sort of emotion of intuition that we have had.   And it still seems like a bad way yo know what God's saying overall   While there are disagreements, I don't think that's because of the system of beliefs is at fault; it's a much more reasonable conclusion to say that there are disagreements because we are human beings. Even the apostles weren't always in agreement with one another on everything, and they had the Holy Spirit guiding them. Christian or not, we're still people with our own ideas, opinions, and personalities."

That, too, is extremist. It's saying that if the text is not true to the extreme literal limit, it's altogether irrelevant.  I understand there are valid reasons to feel the bible is irrelevant but you seem to be saying it's irrelevant because it's extreme, which is, as you said, a self-imposed circular and fear-based bias one brings to the text."

brokehugs,315c06,spacekobra,8,Sun Apr 5 02:03:43 2015 UTC,"Common atheist arguments   The social argument – it’s true because if you accept that it’s true you get a better life. You become part of a community (/r/atheism) The book/written/oral argument – it’s true because someone/something said it was true (eg. Richard Dawkins said there is no God). The force of numbers argument – it’s true because lots of smart people think it's true, therefore I must be right. The belief argument – it’s true because I believe it to be true.  The investment argument – it’s true because I’ve thought too much into this subject to worry myself about alternate belief structures, and it's easier to refute arguments with cookie cutter pastas (eg. misinterpreted Biblical verses). The integrity argument – It’s true because I'm a reasonable and logical person, and anyone who believes in a god is not a reasonable and logical person. The experiential argument – it’s true because I have not experienced the influence of a God.  The inner peace argument – it’s true because I feel peaceful when I know that the universe is logical and that humanity can possibly understand its inner workings. The strength argument – it’s true because I feel stronger/more intelligent inside when I think that I've used science to disprove something. The ignorance argument – it’s true because there are a lot of complicated things that at one point were thought to be magic, when it was proved it wasn't. Therefore, more complicated things (belief in God) fall under the same conditions and can be explained. The indoctrination argument – it’s true because this is what I have been taught (eg. parents that talk about religion are brainwashers, but parents who don't and instead make their kids read atheistic texts are just being reasonable). (Also, the entire atheistic lifestyle of the former Eastern Bloc) The frightening alternative argument – it’s true because the alternative (Humanity [I] can't actually understand everything) frightens me. The self-interest argument – it’s true because people have told me that if I am stupid if I believe in a God, therefore I don't because I am not stupid. The character reference argument – it’s true because I am a rational thinker, and all my friends know this so this so they know I wouldn't believe in something that isn't true. The false prophet argument – it’s true because everyone who disagrees is a stupid fundie. The shifting sand argument – it’s true because I hold fast to each argument until you prove it is not valid. The scared argument – it’s true because I don't know everything in life, so if I think that the entire universe can be understood by humanity, the belief will empower me to make decisions that align with ideas of groups that stand for ""humanity"" (eg. gay rights groups). The intelligent design argument – it’s true because it is completely obvious to everyone except those who refuse to accept it that this fantastic world we live in is random and just sprung out of nowhere. The can’t think argument – it’s true because I really can’t think that there are things like symbolism and metaphors, so I have to take all religious ideas literally, and the ideas are so absurd that they can't be true The how dare you argument – it’s true because how dare you question science? The me argument – it’s true for me, and that’s all I care about."

brokehugs,315c06,PaedragGaidin,1 point,Sat Apr 4 02:59:07 2015 UTC,"nah just going by the overall psychological profile of your initial response. if you're an atheist, you share a lot of common psychological properties stuffy knowitall religious people have. haven't met a lot of atheists like that so the logical conclusion is you're lying through your teeth (like many people, especially the religious, are inclined to do)  actually it's less about where you're from and more about where i'm from. good assumption powers, man! (there's also the problem that you're much more likely to encounter someone from another country, even if they speak the same language, on the internet and therefore they are of a different culture. balance of probability demands i treat you as if you come from somewhere else :D )  your flair could say you're a purple hippopotamus and it would have the same effect. your tantrum could easily be shared by christians who hate other christians, as this whole subreddit is apparently inclined to do. and no, i'm disregarding you because you didn't make any points which made me even think the slightest ""hey, maybe he's right."" not because i'm obstinate, but because you don't make any good points. just so you stop trying to twist my words, i guess i have to say them twice. not really helping your ""i'm an atheist"" case, man."

So a couple of the jokes are that atheists on reddit wear fedoras, eat cheetos, and drink mountain dew. So if anyone references any of these in conversations with you, and they know you're an atheist, they're either making fun of you or gently ribbing you. Also, being outspoken about being against religion is called ""being brave,"" or ""bravery."" So again, if you post something criticizing religion, and someone replies with something like, ""So brave,"" they're making fun of you. Going back to the fedora thing, if someone says something like ""*tips le fedora,"" that's a reference to that stereotype. Also, on the /r/Christianity sub (and all related subs), another common joke is that atheists eat babies.   these are things that are good to know, thank you :D"

Paul called himself a Christian; the authors were Christian. It is therefore illogical to claim that no one became a Christian before reading the letters and epistles written by the apostles, since the apostles themselves were Christians."
brokehugs,315c06,zkkk,1 point,Fri Apr 3 12:53:57 2015 UTC,"well that's my point, the bible and its contents are the claim. it needs other stuff confirming its claims.  well there are more problems there, like the many translations transcriptions and edits. they may not have called themselves christians but others after them could easily have put those words in their proverbial mouths and maybe added some more. there's also the problem that they all clearly did not believe exactly the same things as each other, rendering them each a different ""sect,"" coalescing their total works into the one portion of the book known as the new testament. it is that product which has since been used as the basis for christianity."

[2] He opened the shaft of the bottomless pit, and from the shaft rose smoke like the smoke of a great furnace, and the sun and the air were darkened with the smoke from the shaft. [3] Then from the smoke came locusts on the earth, and they were given power like the power of scorpions of the earth. [4] They were told not to harm the grass of the earth or any green plant or any tree, but only those people who do not have the seal of God on their foreheads. [5] They were allowed to torment them for five months, but not to kill them, and their torment was like the torment of a scorpion when it stings someone. [6] And in those days people will seek death and will not find it. They will long to die, but death will flee from them. [7] In appearance the locusts were like horses prepared for battle: on their heads were what looked like crowns of gold; their faces were like human faces, [8] their hair like women's hair, and their teeth like lions' teeth; [9] they had breastplates like breastplates of iron, and the noise of their wings was like the noise of many chariots with horses rushing into battle. [10] They have tails and stings like scorpions, and their power to hurt people for five months is in their tails. [11] They have as king over them the angel of the bottomless pit. His name in Hebrew is Abaddon, and in Greek he is called Apollyon. [12] The first woe has passed; behold, two woes are still to come.

It's true that Catholics are a much bigger and more accepted group than they were in the past, but I think it's clear  (I guess this means  to me and I could just be entirely wrong!

It looks like about 25% of the US population are some flavor of Baptist.  The rest of the protestants taken together make up about that many.  So, I'm not sure that your characterization of Catholics is good.  I wonder if the part of the dialog you're hearing is specific to where you are, but maybe not reflective of secular voting habits that would have to do with liberal politics at large in the US.  As far as who's shouting loudest in faith dialog in the US, that also appears to boil down to who you're listening to."
