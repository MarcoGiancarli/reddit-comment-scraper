MonsterHunter,3e2tpg,cpuonfire,9,Tue Jul 21 15:32:19 2015 UTC,I threw a farcaster on the ground and a monster knocked me away. Really annoying because it was my last farcaster.

MonsterHunter,3e2pk7,Foxhound91,5,Tue Jul 21 14:31:23 2015 UTC,Why do I see so many ppl use this CB? It seems to max out on blue sharpness. I watched someone solo a 140 apex Rajang with it. Am I missing something? It looks like the Akantor CB.
MonsterHunter,3e2pk7,DrRad,6,Tue Jul 21 15:11:02 2015 UTC,"It trades sharpness for a larger amount of Raw. If you have Minds Eye or Steady Hand, the sharpness doesn't matter."
MonsterHunter,3e2pk7,crooked_robot,8,Tue Jul 21 15:14:26 2015 UTC,"Also, because the impact phials scale off Raw and are not affected by hitzones or sharpness"
MonsterHunter,3e2pk7,LiuMeister,4,Tue Jul 21 15:30:10 2015 UTC,Impact phial explosions don't give a shit about sharpness. Only raw attack matters and Akantor CB has plenty of it.
MonsterHunter,3e2pk7,Canta_MH,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:26:39 2015 UTC,So is it actually like the best CB or? I'm really asking I'm trying to get into CB lol. I made one for each element but idk if you wanna play like that with CB's as you said only raw matters?
MonsterHunter,3e2pk7,DrRad,3,Tue Jul 21 15:43:12 2015 UTC,"It's a good CB if you want to play an artillery-style CB. In other words, there is a huge emphasis on landing your Phial Bursts and Guard Points. Such a method works best in single player to exploit the fact that a monster is constantly on you to make guard points effective.  Now, Elemental CBs can be very strong. You can play this same form of artillery-style playstyle with an elemental CB, trading off the impact phials for elemental phials concentrated on elemental weak spots."
MonsterHunter,3e2pk7,Laxaria,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:55:09 2015 UTC,"Element is useful for speedruns and if you can consistently hit elemental weakzones. Impact is a general purpose tool with knockout power, plus the explosions ignore armor and scale off of the weapon's Raw damage (which is why Akantor CB has a following).  Also, it's not the best CB per se, but it ranks among one of the best craftable CBs (the top three are Akantor, Ceadeus and Diablos IIRC). Only Relics can beat it out in terms of true attack stats."
MonsterHunter,3e2pk7,S20-TBL,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:07:07 2015 UTC,Not sure if you misunderstood me but I meant I crafted one for each element not each element phial. All my cb are impact. Would akantor be my best bet for crafted? Basically do I want to take raw for cbs over everything like great sword?
MonsterHunter,3e2pk7,DrRad,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:13:24 2015 UTC,"raw over everything else   This again goes back to your phial type. For impact however raw is very much king.  Be aware though that while akantor CB explosions are amazing the actual axe damage off of CBs is a pretty good component so the cedeaus, kushala, etc are all still pretty good. Plus while element is not king it still adds up if you are cautious and spend more time in SnS mode racking up quantity > quality.   Be aware however that overall, and this is by an incredible margin, CB might be the best elemental class. Element phial takes a lot more armor skills and much, much more precision but we are talking about the single largest unloading of damage possible in the game."
MonsterHunter,3e2pk7,Arterra,-1,Tue Jul 21 16:23:26 2015 UTC,"Not all top out at blue, I know that Schwarzschild, at least, hits white. It doesn't have much white, but still. That bit about impact-based attacks ignoring sharpness comes in handy too."

MonsterHunter,3e2yr3,ShadyFigure,3,Tue Jul 21 19:12:10 2015 UTC,"Is holding R to guard (as opposed to guard point) with CB a noob/emergency thing to do kinda like GS guard, or is it common tactics even for experienced players?"
MonsterHunter,3e2yr3,Ivalia,5,Tue Jul 21 16:24:11 2015 UTC,"The shield is good. Though it can lessen your sharpness, in a pinch it's still very effective and helpful. Good for roars/wind/ect. Just because you can't GP everything every time doesn't mean you're a noob. You have a shield, you can use it."
MonsterHunter,3e2yr3,JFW0RD,4,Tue Jul 21 16:28:34 2015 UTC,"With a charged shield you are basically a lance, so minimal detriment to blocking. Plus you can still pull off counter attacks off a block like you can GP, you just get more knock back and no free phial burst."
MonsterHunter,3e2yr3,Arterra,2,Tue Jul 21 16:31:36 2015 UTC,"It's more of an oh, shit! tactic. Sometimes you'll find yourself in a position where you can't evade an attack, and I would much prefer to guard an attack I can't evade, than eat full damage.

MonsterHunter,3e2yr3,ExiusXavarus,2,Tue Jul 21 16:39:06 2015 UTC,"In relation to elemental LBG -   If the hitzone for shot is high, but it has relatively low elemental hitzones, is it better to NOT use elemental shots, ie go HBG instead?   Also, on Najaralas, what ARE the Resounding/Freezing Organ hitzones, and are hitzones still viable to shoot at if they're broken?"
MonsterHunter,3e2yr3,JFW0RD,4,Tue Jul 21 16:27:15 2015 UTC,"Elemental shots do some raw, but nowhere near enough to waste on high shot hitzones.   As for naj im not aware if the hitzone changes when broken, but regular the sounders are hard and for tidal they are soft."

Ele LBGs are definitely not so good on certain monsters.  For example Zamtrios is best done with Pierce, and Kirin doesn't care about element too much iirc."
MonsterHunter,3e2yr3,Ivalia,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:04:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but I enjoy Ele gunning, especially in groups. I definitely see how solo it can be a little more tricky. LBG has been my favorite gunner weapon to use, (bow I find too finicky and HBG too slow) but I can see I'll need to diversify anyway. It's also I guess just the popular opinion thing that HBG is always ""better"" that's putting me off, because while I like fast kill times like the next hunter, I also enjoy the hunt and the ninja mobility of ele gunning.  The proof is in the pudding, and I know some monsters just aren't made for ele gunning. Zam I used my fire LBG and seemed to do fine, kirin the same. Kirin doesn't really care about any damage anyway, but I liked that even when charged up I could at least still hit it and break the horn."
MonsterHunter,3e2yr3,JFW0RD,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:12:55 2015 UTC,You can play raw LBG as well.  I'm willing to bet a Pierce LBG can do Zam faster than ele.

I generally use my Rath Line in a pinch since the armor I use it with has Fire Attack +3 and AuL, which works for the rapid Flame S and Normal 2. I'm sure the Griscannon or Destiny's Arm would work for that too, but I'm still just shy of getting my Ace/Sororal Set together.  In general though, I've read that Raw LBG isn't very effective (especially not pierce) due to the wait times from Rapid for pierce."
MonsterHunter,3e2yr3,JFW0RD,2,Tue Jul 21 17:29:44 2015 UTC,"I use Pierce LBG limiter removed and almost matched Gopherlad's ele LBG kill time for a HR jho (something like 6:10 vs 6:27).  And in teams my gun has a bit more utility because limiter removed.  Rapid fire Pierce isn't very good, but Vayu is definitely not the only good raw LBG."

MonsterHunter,3e2yr3,Ivalia,2,Tue Jul 21 17:51:15 2015 UTC,What do gaurdpoints do aside from guarding and looking cool
MonsterHunter,3e2yr3,XMrCoolWhipX,4,Tue Jul 21 16:32:00 2015 UTC,"If your shield is charged, it's a free phial burst. Which translates to simultaneously blocking said attack, and essentially hitting it with an Axe phial attack. It's handy.   Edit:if it's an impact phial, the GP will also do impact damage. You can actually knock a rath out of the air by GPing a fireball. GP KOs feel soooooo good, too."
MonsterHunter,3e2yr3,GinghamLion,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:35:14 2015 UTC,"Impact phials don't actually do impact damage, they do non-type, meaning it ignores hitzones. They also do KO, but that isn't tied to impact type damage."
MonsterHunter,3e2yr3,ShadyFigure,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:15:30 2015 UTC,"Ah, that makes sense, I've almost always used cutting weapons so I forget that impact means blunt weapon. KO is what I was thinking of.   Just another example of the same word being used in too many places in monster hunter. All meaning different things."
MonsterHunter,3e2yr3,GinghamLion,2,Tue Jul 21 19:32:44 2015 UTC,"They add one more level to a block. So for an uncharged shield you go from GS level to Lance level, and with a charged shield and guard +2 you actually have stronger guard than lance ever can. All in all this means less knockback / chip damage which lets you act sooner.   And with a charged shield you also unload a mini phial burst, making it great for free damage."
MonsterHunter,3e2yr3,Arterra,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:34:55 2015 UTC,Is evade distance a must have for switch axe? Like how GS needs fast charge and gunlance needs artillery god. I searched for switch axe skill threads and sometimes people say it's must have and sometimes people don't mention it at all which is kind of confusing and makes me think it's more of a convenience skill? I don't know. Help me play switch axe effectively.
MonsterHunter,3e2yr3,Wanderlus7,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:39:27 2015 UTC,"Using Evade Extender with Switch Axe allows you to be a lot more mobile without having to sheathe your weapon. I personally cannot use switch axe without evade extender, as it's too sluggish otherwise."
MonsterHunter,3e2yr3,JFW0RD,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:46:47 2015 UTC,"You CAN live without it against some monsters but against most, particular monsters that move around a lot you will want Evade Extender.

I managed to beat the first urgent quest without to many problems, but then when I tried the emerald congalala he was 3 shotting me. I was wondering if that I need to start playing more defensive with my ig or try and get a new armor set? Currently using the full nerscylla set from low rank"
MonsterHunter,3e2yr3,polygone3,3,Tue Jul 21 16:53:15 2015 UTC,"Welcome to High Rank! It's the first proper introduction to how punishing MH actually is. It's definitely encouraged to create a new set for your High Rank adventures. Personally, I would do the double velocidrome quest to craft the Velociprey S set, as it has good defense, half stun and high attack. With some gems you can fit in Psychic, and anything else that your talismans allow. (It has torso up, so anything you gem in the chest piece will be doubled!) Be sure to use the armor spheres to keep your defense upgraded.  Also in high rank, monsters will combo their moves a lot faster, and have less ""rest breaks"" for you to punish. Don't overcommit to your attacks, and be ready for anything. Also at this point, there's no freebie items at the start of quests, so you'll need to begin to prepare ahead of time for every quest henceforth."

MonsterHunter,3e2yr3,Arterra,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:59:54 2015 UTC,"Both. Armor will only carry you so far, the rest is up to you. That said, you definitely want to upgrade your armor, high rank armors offer better or different skills, as well as much better defense."

If you guys got any suggestions I'd love to hear them. Thanks."
MonsterHunter,3e2yr3,NotDedfelica,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:01:01 2015 UTC,"Awaken is so niche, and even more so with focus being the main skill.  One option I see float around is the Molten Tigrex Greatsword.  Great raw, great (awoken) blast, but absolutely requires razor sharp if you want the purple to last.  I suppose the reason people avoid it is due to needing four skills to use it: awaken, focus, razor sharp, and shrp+1 / honed blade. That set is entirely possible but you need a good talisman and possibly edgemaster relic armor to pull off anything greater.   In fact speaking of relics, that's probably the best option for Lag armor.  A relic weapon with great awoken element/status."

MonsterHunter,3e2yr3,azchocula,2,Tue Jul 21 17:32:28 2015 UTC,"I made a side character as my main was well into G-Rank and it was a mental thing for me. I don't like trying new things right away with already having the ""best"" available. I kind of like to feel the struggle of learning from scratch, to better appreciate what the top-end weapons really can do.  That said, it's not for everyone. If it's an element weapon, go test it on a High Rank monster that would be weak to it. Otherwise, go try it out in an expedition!"
MonsterHunter,3e2yr3,JFW0RD,2,Tue Jul 21 17:57:54 2015 UTC,"Expeditions work well for this!  You can die as many times as you can stand (eat for Feylne Foodie), pick up cathanagea items for boosting Wycoon trades, and score caravan points along the way.    First though, I'd play through the weapon tutorial a few times, before and after watching some GaijinHunter videos, or reading his blogposts.  There's a megathread here for each weapon type as well, that can prove useful for finding good sets/mandatory skills, and figuring out what qualities to look for in a weapon."

When I get something new or cool I use it on a Caravan quest, unless I am trying to farm to upgrade it. I don't want to embarrass myself in front of the online people so I keep it to myself till I get decent at it. Try it on every type, flying/large/small etc.   If you are looking around for something new to try then make sure you checked out the Arena quests in 1* and see what suits your fancy.   This is probably all well-known to you but figured I'd mention it anyway. GOOD LUCK!"

IM READY:  When you are in the Guild Hall and sign up for a quest, some of the ""pages"" above your head are grey, red, or green. WHY?!  Combining shit. What is the benefit of combining one item with another... To make the same item? Like Slickaxe and ore? Or the meld items?"
MonsterHunter,3e2yr3,HugYoMama,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:44:13 2015 UTC,Grey means it's a capture quest. Red is hunting/slaying. Green are usually gathering quests like Harvest Tours.
MonsterHunter,3e2yr3,deviousSprite,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:54:40 2015 UTC,"Red = Kill or Capture quest. Grey = Capture only. Green = Gathering/Delivery quests.  Slickaxe will allow you to make two of a very rare item. It obviously doesn't make sense to use it on iron ore, but a Dragonbone Artifact though...  Melding items isn't really necessary since you have the Wyporium and it can do most of it. Melding talismans can allow you to trade junk talismans for some new ones."
MonsterHunter,3e2yr3,JFW0RD,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:54:56 2015 UTC,"Red ""pages"" are for hunting or slaying quests.  Quests where you kill stuff.  Green are for gathering quests and harvest tours.  Quests where you pick stuff up off the ground (maybe with a pickaxe or bug net).  Grey are for any other quests.  Mostly, this means capturing quests.  Slickaxes combine with ore to make more ore than you started with.  So you consume the slickaxe to multiply the ore.  Melding items similarly duplicates them at the cost of frenzy crystals.  Since most of those items are relatively annoying to farm, and you get bunches of many frenzy crystals that you'll never use, it's a good way to keep up stocks of some things.  (I like it for pale extract, but I don't use dash juice.)  Melding talismans turns them into other talismans.  Speeds up charm farming if you can spare the vile frenzy crystals."

MonsterHunter,3e0t0u,InstaCakes,4,Tue Jul 21 10:23:54 2015 UTC,EXPLOSIONS!  I'm just dissapointed they weren't blast DBs. One good Demon Dance would've been hilarious to see.
MonsterHunter,3e0t0u,SuperfluousMoniker,9,Tue Jul 21 11:37:43 2015 UTC,That shit would proc if he breathed near the monster.
MonsterHunter,3e0t0u,Syvera,12,Tue Jul 21 04:55:34 2015 UTC,"No the status itself still has a 1 in 3 chance to proc and when it does it inflicts 1,900 blast ailment, surpassing the blast threshold of the monster and causing an explosion that deals damage similar to a LBB"
MonsterHunter,3e0t0u,Quivering_Star,4,Tue Jul 21 05:04:48 2015 UTC,"Wouldn't that cause about 10 explosions at the same time, then?"
MonsterHunter,3e0t0u,OnnaJReverT,5,Tue Jul 21 06:25:38 2015 UTC,"it doesnt cause multiples because when the statusbar fills up it procs, then ""empties"" the bar again, it doesnt fill multiple times and counts the fills"

MonsterHunter,3e0t0u,Ryukapples1,8,Tue Jul 21 13:26:52 2015 UTC,I dont get cheaters seriously. Seeing tons of hr999 online as of late. So its good to know when i reach that rank legitimately ill just look like all those cheats. I dont get whats the point if u didnt reach it on your own. Those numbers mean shit if u didnt. Your so bad at a game you gotta hack it huh? Maybe they should play something more their level like tic tac toe.
MonsterHunter,3e0t0u,StayNightMH,24,Tue Jul 21 02:52:10 2015 UTC,"I kinda agree and kinda disagree with your comment. I agree that the hacked HR999s do somewhat devalue the achievement of legitimately achieving it, but it comes down to perspective. I'm gonna get HR999 for me, because to me it means something. I don't care if it means nothing to someone, or the world to another. Seeing someone with hacked HR999 just makes me chuckle when I see their guild card. But seeing the guild card of someone with legit HR999? now that's a humbling and respectable thing indeed. When the time comes I eventually get it myself, (about 326 ranks to go), I'll feel proud of myself at my own achievement and that's all that matters to me.  Hacking the game doesn't necessarily mean people are bad, it just means they play the game differently to how you do and want to experiment with things, typically out of humor. That being said, I don't encourage hacking or powersaing impossible charms etc, and don't play with people that do. (Unlocking jpdlc gear is fine by me, but broken charms isn't - just to specify)"
MonsterHunter,3e0t0u,Scipio_Wright,3,Tue Jul 21 03:30:08 2015 UTC,"On a side note, try having your final quest to 999 be memorable. Like killing with kicks only, or only wyvernfires."
MonsterHunter,3e0t0u,StayNightMH,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:30:25 2015 UTC,Will do! :D
MonsterHunter,3e0t0u,Phenyhelm,3,Tue Jul 21 06:05:55 2015 UTC,Just looking at a false HR999's guild card will tell the story. No way someone with a handful of IG hunts made it there legit.   Your card will speak for itself when you make it there.
MonsterHunter,3e0t0u,S_all_Good,-5,Tue Jul 21 12:12:02 2015 UTC,"Why are you mad? It is a video game. You know, a toy meant to be played with. I've never cheated, and never gotten mad at someone for doing as they please. You should be happy more people are playing MH."
MonsterHunter,3e0t0u,Gopherlad,23,Tue Jul 21 03:16:53 2015 UTC,"My opinion is that one's right to fuck with the game ends when public multiplayer is involved. Mod and hack all you want in single player, but hop online with that stuff and you're devaluing the experience for everyone else. That's just not cool.  Now there's kind of a weird line with HR hacking since that doesn't technically affect anything related to gameplay, but you devalue the achievement for those that reached HR999 legitimately."
MonsterHunter,3e0t0u,SomeWriter13,8,Tue Jul 21 05:01:34 2015 UTC,"One thing that hacking 999 does to gameplay is that it is no longer a good indicator of one's experience. For all I know I could be hunting alongside a carried individual, and won't know how inexperienced he is with a certain monster until it's too late (apex, maybe, or something not available in lower G-ranks like a Shah Dalamadur).   When I hunt with players who have 400+ HR rank for example, I can tell during a quest that they know their stuff.  They know how to dodge, sometimes with ridiculously impeccable timing. They know when to use Life Powder, and when to let me heal on my own. They know their weapons intimately. And they just understand the monster at a higher level than those with less experience. They are able to dance with the monster.  Beyond devaluing the achievement of 999, you are also masking your true experience level. And to some players who don't have a lot of time per session to play, being misled by someone's experience level could lead to frustration. Just my two cents. Not discounting what you said!"
MonsterHunter,3e0t0u,miguidotcom,6,Tue Jul 21 06:12:45 2015 UTC,You'd be then surprised on the amount of legit hr999s that simply got there doing hame for a while.
MonsterHunter,3e0t0u,SomeWriter13,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:08:55 2015 UTC,"True. I've never really encountered any of those types, to be honest. But I bet I'll know within a few minutes of a hunt if they are legit experienced hunters. And I'd be thankful to hunt with them!"
MonsterHunter,3e0t0u,StayNightMH,3,Tue Jul 21 19:45:13 2015 UTC,This is a solid response.
MonsterHunter,3e0t0u,SomeWriter13,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:49:53 2015 UTC,Thanks!
MonsterHunter,3e0t0u,SotiCoto,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:39:02 2015 UTC,Coming to 4U from 3U... all I see when I notice an HR999 is someone who ran out of things to do and just decided to spend hours a day grinding for HR. Except now they can do it in less than an hour.   They have HR999 because they want to show off. Like they're just whipping their cock out and swinging it around.  That shit is crass. Real crass. Whether cheated or legit. I tend to find middling HRs more impressive. The 400 region. Usually more indicative of just having got there through doing a lot of regular hunting... rather than obscene HR-grind.
MonsterHunter,3e0t0u,Vizria,2,Tue Jul 21 08:46:17 2015 UTC,No but problems start to arise when we start getting into this huge cheaters are ok/not ok argument. I honestly don't want them in my rooms unless they only used it to get back things because of corrupted save/deleted one by accident/etc...   The thing with cheating in MH is that it devalues the whole experience far more than any other game because of the gameplay. You're also doing a huge disservice to yourself for making the fights easier than they should be. I'm only talking about those who cheat to just blast through everything their first run through a MH game. So I can sort of see why people don't want them in their rooms. Especially if the hacker has no experience on their belt whatsoever.

I ran outta power coatings and the apex came. it took my Horn user 3 carts to attempt the wystone. She hit him once and noted right out of there. You get so many potions and crap along with 9 FREAKING CARTS you think she would have tried something more then hitting it once.   EDIT: I've used the bow all of like 6 times so I'd like to say I'm gettin' it but thats a lie.
MonsterHunter,3e2fuo,Ivalia,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:29:49 2015 UTC,Have you done the triplets yet? Only 2 sets have wystones...
MonsterHunter,3e2fuo,Laxaria,-2,Tue Jul 21 14:21:07 2015 UTC,dual hammers easy. Bow and horn combo should have been easy but my horn user didn't even try. She just ran around thinking I could kill it before she died...
MonsterHunter,3e2fuo,Ivalia,0,Tue Jul 21 14:48:40 2015 UTC,"Honestly I don't see why people complain about Arena. I've gotten S or A in all G Rank arena quests with every weapon because I wanted all the stuff you get for doing it. It took me a couple days of light playing, but it's really not that hard. They don't give you horrible stuff, and it's like getting to try out a ""demo version"" of an armor set and weapon that you would otherwise have to grind for.   Yeah, sometimes they really mess with you with horrible stat stealing talismans, but it's to show you how little you need to be successful. Embrace the idea of it being a way of teaching you how to use new things, and to deal with whatever comes your way. None of the weapons are crap. None of them. If you're used to using top tier weapons, that's on you, but I guarantee you that you do enough damage with the arena ones. You wouldn't want to do it solo, but it's not impossible.  The triple tigrex quest is easily the most hellish not only because you deal with three tigrex, but because they give you sets that are actually hindering you. Hammer and HH with Taunt (not good when you have two tigrex in the arena at once, trust me), lance and GL without wystones (mind you there's an apex tigrex). You're really messed up for that fight and it's tough as hell. Do you know who hasn't carted to a tigrex ever since then? Me, because I did them all, some of them even multiple times."
MonsterHunter,3e2fuo,Laxaria,-1,Tue Jul 21 16:00:58 2015 UTC,Honestly I have done the triple tigrex with Hammer and Bow and so long as someone sticks to hammer or horn once you kill one the others drop like flies.   Now I hate hate hate the low and high rank ones because the weapons are just terrible. I know I'm now super spoiled with G rank but honestly Low and High Rank weapons are just no worth using.
MonsterHunter,3e2fuo,Ivalia,-1,Tue Jul 21 16:26:22 2015 UTC,Arena map is pretty bad but still doesn't change that APEX is a lazy and stupid concept. Still my IMO
MonsterHunter,3e2fuo,Laxaria,2,Tue Jul 21 13:16:36 2015 UTC,"I don't think Apex is lazy, it fits in well with the story and adds an extra layer of difficulty. What I dislike about Apex is the wystone mechanic/bouncing mechanic especially at 140 GQ's, by the second time a monster is knocked out of apex get ready for a needlessly long hunt in addition to those beefed out 1 shot monster stats."
MonsterHunter,3e2fuo,Ivalia,-3,Tue Jul 21 15:20:00 2015 UTC,I can tell you I hate them both. Apex I hate cause its a lazy mechanic. Arena I hate like my ex girlfriend.

Sad we didn't get to see the mechanics behind it. (Edit: According to Arekkz, it's like a meter on the touchscreen which builds up, which would make it a bit balanced.

The problem I have is that the older pre-4th generation levels brought back like Forest and Hills look completely out of place in MHX due to the fact that they haven't been upgraded visuals wise to look more modern.  Compare the Forest and Hills with the new forest-like area that is brand-new to MHX. The former looks spare and dry, while the latter looks very rich and has much better textures. They really look like they just lazily copy and pasted the old levels from 1st/2nd/3rd generations without improving the visuals to make them look less dated.   It's jarring to see the complex visuals of the character/monster animations contrasted with the simplistic and old-looking levels."
MonsterHunter,3dy19e,snakedawgG,14,Mon Jul 20 17:18:08 2015 UTC,"Often in game design, they don't do things like the blue knife flashes for ""flashiness"". It's more likely they do these things to give players tells and visual cues (granted it's still kinda flashy--I like it though). So now, players on the ground will be able to SEE if a player is mounting a monster right away. I also noticed the fire effect on players is much larger than before, so it's easier to see you're in danger. Especially on a smaller screen like the 3DS, these bright effects help players know what's going on right away."
MonsterHunter,3dy19e,zStatykz,5,Mon Jul 20 17:59:23 2015 UTC,"Personally, I found that little glimpse nostalgic. It absolutely has been updated visually, the textures are much smoother than I remember them being. What you're getting at is that they haven't redesigned them much to conform to modern standards.  I think that's a bit early to say, though; we only saw 4 of the areas, 3 of which, off the top of my head, looked much more interesting to fight in than they used to be. Area 4 in particular has changed dramatically with that gigantic rock in the middle now being a small platform.   I would very surprised if the rest of the areas didn't get a significant overhaul; 6 will likely be much more traverseable and all of the heavily wooded areas are ripe with opportunities for terrain mixups."
MonsterHunter,3dy19e,ArcTruth,2,Mon Jul 20 17:58:48 2015 UTC,"I'd say that the old zone looks sparse, but it still looks really good."
MonsterHunter,3dy19e,Draffut_,2,Mon Jul 20 18:07:10 2015 UTC,Yeah. Best to get more information.
MonsterHunter,3dy19e,Vizria,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:55:45 2015 UTC,"I think the SnS may have used it twice because either A) it's not as powerful and therefore allows a couple of uses per bar. or B) he was tripped and didn't finish it, so maybe it allowed him to use the meter again, kind of like when you get knocked over doing a CB Ultra. Not 100% sure though because as you say, we didn't see the bottom screen"
MonsterHunter,3dy19e,hvk13,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:03:30 2015 UTC,I think its ok for SnS to be able to cast a few times. Provided the dmg isn't too high.
MonsterHunter,3dy19e,Anthan,0,Tue Jul 21 03:24:55 2015 UTC,"Maybe it's diminishing returns. I noticed that the Gunlance also used its special move twice in succession when the hoppy kangaroo birdy thing was stuck in the pitfall trap. Only the first time it used it the explosion was very large, but the second time it was much smaller."
MonsterHunter,3dy19e,Meowsticgoesnya,2,Mon Jul 20 19:44:37 2015 UTC,"I think the first time was super, and the second was wyvern fire."

MonsterHunter,3dy19e,TacticianRobin,13,Mon Jul 20 18:51:14 2015 UTC,"What the heck is the bar at the Gunlance section of the video? It looks like a sharpness meter, but it didn't go down as the sharpness went down to orange.  Is it a new mechanic of the weapon, a bar used by one of the hunting styles, or something entirely different? I'm curious, damnit!"
MonsterHunter,3dy19e,Kazuja,4,Mon Jul 20 16:18:11 2015 UTC,"My completely uneducated guess, maybe your gun can overheat if you spam shells? It definitely seems to have something to do with shelling, since it has the number of shells on the right side of the bar, and the indicator on the bar flashed red after he used Wyvernfire (and I'm presuming stopped flashing when he could use it again).   Maybe if you start spamming shells the indicator goes up to yellow, then orange, then red, and if it overheats you have to wait for it to cool before you can shell again? Or not, I could be completely wrong.  Edit: Or could it have to do with charging shells? Like now it just charges for a certain amount of time then fires, maybe in X you can hold the button to charge then let go to fire, but run the risk of messing up if you wait too long? I like that idea better."
MonsterHunter,3dy19e,il-maleducata,3,Mon Jul 20 18:22:56 2015 UTC,"I do kinda suspect it's something about overheating as well, but we can only guess from what we saw, which annoys me a little.  It would be kind of cool if the overheating would actually grant benefits rather than disabling shells on overuse though. Like, if you use shells often enough to stay in red, but without getting to the edge of the bar, you'd get damage bonuses or something because the shells fire with some extra power to them while the weapon is running hot."
MonsterHunter,3dy19e,Fruntunka,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:49:08 2015 UTC,"Totally my guess, as well. The gunlancer was a full-burst guy and not a combo chap, so it's still tough to tell."
MonsterHunter,3dy19e,Kansoku,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:56:38 2015 UTC,"I sincerely hope because it's really hard to spam shelling since it's so slow and leaves you terribly vulnerable. An overheat bar as that would be a downright nerf, which GL doesn't need at all.  I do hope that it's a bar where you can charge shells though--with limitations."
MonsterHunter,3dy19e,skuFFFace,3,Tue Jul 21 18:09:49 2015 UTC,"I think the colors are related to the sized of the Wyvern Fire, with red being the ""supernova"" sized that was shown in the first trailer/screenshots. What i don'  know tho is how do you increase the bar. Nothing he did moved the bar."
MonsterHunter,3dy19e,Kansoku,2,Mon Jul 20 18:30:14 2015 UTC,"He did the supernova once when the monster was trapped, but the bar didn't change through the entire time."
MonsterHunter,3dy19e,skuFFFace,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:56:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but it was way smaller than what we've seen previously"
MonsterHunter,3dy19e,Kansoku,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:00:59 2015 UTC,Have you compared it to the trailer? I didn't but it seemed pretty much the same to me
MonsterHunter,3dy19e,JouresKoh,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:48:01 2015 UTC,"I went back to check it and now I'm not sure. They seem roughly the same size, but on the trailer it was far away, not close up like on the gameplay. No idea what the bar is then."
MonsterHunter,3dy19e,Gerff,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:54:13 2015 UTC,"The number inside the bar shows the number of shell you have, the white cursor serve two functions, once it's flashing it mean your Wyvern Fire is cooling down, it will stop flashing once your Wyvern Fire is ready. The another function is unknown for now.  My guess is, it is the level for Charge Shot. You will know exactly how much you had charged for your charge shot with this indicator. I believe this is most possible reason of it."
MonsterHunter,3dy19e,Fruntunka,8,Tue Jul 21 03:48:19 2015 UTC,"WOOO GUNLANCE BUFFS! I have no idea what the colors on the bar mean, but I do know that the number indicates the number of shells. Was that a giant fireball or flamethrower? I also love how you can wyvern fire in pretty much any position now."
MonsterHunter,3dy19e,Gerff,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:54:48 2015 UTC,"I'm glad that it plays the same and given new properties (that mystery bar??!!), and it seems that they have reduced some end lag on a lot of attacks, making it a little quicker and smoother."
MonsterHunter,3dy19e,Fruntunka,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:18:07 2015 UTC,"That's the best buff to it honestly. It won't be overloaded/op like the CB or IG, its just quality of life changes. I wonder what the hammer gets. Maybe a jumping hammer pound?"
MonsterHunter,3dy19e,BanderCo3url,2,Mon Jul 20 18:41:27 2015 UTC,"We have the same taste in weapons! Well according to previous mhx info, hammer gets a special 1HKO swipe so that's a good bonus. I'm not sure if it's a meter that must be filled to unleash or not, but if hammer could KO more easily, then I think that's the buff it definitely deserves."
MonsterHunter,3dy19e,Arterra,0,Mon Jul 20 18:48:37 2015 UTC,"Being able to dodge after shelling would be nice, too. And triple hop like its cousin, and a counter-shell, and being able to block while charging WyvernFire. (I have no idea how balancing works)"

XD And if you watch the gunlance and the IG users showcasing that jumping feathery Jaggi-type as well as how Nargacuga looks in the current engine, they're at least decent hunters. :P"
MonsterHunter,3dy19e,il-maleducata,6,Tue Jul 21 04:39:05 2015 UTC,"So Switch Axe can unsheathe into the Hack 'n Slash combo finisher eh? Interesting.  Also, that Gunlance bar, anyone think it might be like your gun overheating? Maybe spamming shells moves you closer to red, and if you overheat you have to wait for it to cool down? I did notice the indicator on the bar started flashing after they used Wyvernfire, so I'm guessing that will stop when you can use it again."
MonsterHunter,3dy19e,MacksJackson,6,Mon Jul 20 16:43:52 2015 UTC,"Anyone else notice that Royal Ludroth insect glaive? Is that new?

I saw a lot of chatter about the IG getting heavily nerfed, no more infinite combo, etc., but it looked pretty much exactly the same. I think I heard them say he was using Guild style though, so who knows how the others work.  Lance looked wonderful. :]"
MonsterHunter,3dy19e,the_neutral_scrub,9,Mon Jul 20 14:37:05 2015 UTC,"Why would it get nerfed? You can only do the ""infinite"" combo while you have the red juice. It's not like you can do it at any point without even trying."
MonsterHunter,3dy19e,kabuto_mushi,-4,Mon Jul 20 14:44:55 2015 UTC,"Why would it get nerfed?   Because it was at least a little overpowered in 4U, at least in my humble opinion. Not so much that it breaks the game or anything, but still noticeably more effective than say DS/LS. Apparently it was even stronger in the original too. I'd argue that it's brought more down to the level of other Blademaster weapons by the fact that everything can do jump attacks now...  Also I thought you could do the infinite whenever you want? You just wouldn't without red sauce because of how much damage you miss out on."
MonsterHunter,3dy19e,the_neutral_scrub,11,Mon Jul 20 15:04:26 2015 UTC,"No, you need the red juice. Without it your attacks are a lot slower and have a considerable delay between each other if you don't combo."
MonsterHunter,3dy19e,kabuto_mushi,-2,Mon Jul 20 15:08:33 2015 UTC,"Just so I'm clear, the infinite combo we're talking about here is neutral X-X-A-repeat, correct? Because I just tested it in game with and without red, the time between the moves is exactly the same and they both chain infinitely. With red each move just has an extra hit..."
MonsterHunter,3dy19e,Answerofduty,9,Mon Jul 20 15:20:51 2015 UTC,Honestly if we're going with that then every weapon has an infinite combo. I can just mash X with the SA and never stop attacking.
MonsterHunter,3dy19e,MoralTrilemma,-2,Mon Jul 20 15:22:29 2015 UTC,Ya you're probably right on that one. Really the only reason X-X-A is noteworthy is because X-X-X and A-A have a strong finishing move but your hunter has a long finishing animation on the last hit where you can't do anything while he twirls the stick around. You know?
MonsterHunter,3dy19e,kabuto_mushi,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:36:55 2015 UTC,"You can hit X after the red juiced A - A (or X - X - X - A) finisher and you'll do the quick poke, which loops back into the second part of the X combo."
MonsterHunter,3dy19e,MoralTrilemma,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:36:13 2015 UTC,"Jumping isn't the reason IG is OP, Mounting makes fights easier, but doesn't make them faster. There's a reason IG has the fastest solo times on pretty much everything (Master's test in 7 minutes anyone?), and the solo runs don't use mounting."
MonsterHunter,3dy19e,VagabondWolf,2,Mon Jul 20 22:25:43 2015 UTC,"Oh, is that why downvotes happened? I didn't mean to imply that IG was OP just because it has good mount attacks, obviously it's speed and essences (red and white in particular) combine to make it as strong as it is."
MonsterHunter,3dy19e,MoralTrilemma,2,Mon Jul 20 22:47:42 2015 UTC,"No idea why particularly you were downvoted, but I wouldn't take it to heart.

MonsterHunter,3dy19e,CislunarR,6,Mon Jul 20 17:29:23 2015 UTC,"It's tied to your stamina, so you can only spam it until your meter runs out. Pair that with mega dash juice however, and I guess so?"
MonsterHunter,3dy19e,GoatsEatingCoins,4,Mon Jul 20 18:29:54 2015 UTC,On the brightside it looks like they nerfed how many jumps it takes to take down a monster as Rathalos wasn't mounted in 2 hits as he usually is in 4u

MonsterHunter,3dy19e,DefiantTheLion,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:18:53 2015 UTC,"I think that the jump attack (for SnS) is done by beginning a roll and then canceling it somehow, probably with another press of the B button. This is as far as I have watched but maybe those that have watched the full thing can provide some insight.  EDIT: upon further viewing the CB also does the same movement as the SnS right before the jump attack, perhaps confirming my first thoughts (no other weapons have shown their jump attacks as of yet 20 minutes into the video)."
MonsterHunter,3dy19e,Meowsticgoesnya,4,Mon Jul 20 16:47:39 2015 UTC,"Those were the only 2 that showed the jump because they were the only ones using the Aerial style. The Insect Glaive for example was using Guild (legacy) style.  The style mechanics apply to all weapons, so I imagine all 14 weapons will jump in the same (or very similar) ways - while still maintaining their unique movesets."
MonsterHunter,3dy19e,N0Name01,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:59:34 2015 UTC,"I love the jumping style! But it pretty much took away the Insect Glaive's main use, as well as reduce the impact of the SNS' up-cliff jump.  More balance, I suppose. Looking forward to perma-mounting monsters harharhar."
MonsterHunter,3dy19e,easternmind,3,Mon Jul 20 16:54:42 2015 UTC,"The way I see it is, IG is no longer a requirement to get access to that form of CC, but still excels at it.  I don't know much about the system but the advantage I'd imagine would be having access to the other hunting ""styles"" while still having access to mounts where other weapons would have to pick that acrobatic hunting style just to mount."

MonsterHunter,3dy19e,slowebro,2,Tue Jul 21 04:32:46 2015 UTC,"The IGs main purpose definitely isn't mounting. The mounting is nice and all, but the main appeal of the weapon is the buffing mechanic. With a max speed bug and extract extender, DPS goes through the roof. In G Rank, constant mounting actually lowers DPS  and it's too risky throwing out jumps. I spent 300 hours using only IG in 4U haha. I'm interested in seeing how the aerial style will work for the IG. Like maybe it'll just be a less laggy jumping alternative."
MonsterHunter,3dy19e,Jlikew00t,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:15:13 2015 UTC,"Ah. What I meant was use to the team. While buffing (red extract is what I hear my IG friend keep mentioning) is really good at making him a powerhouse (we always appreciate that) every time we have an IG user on the team his responsibility is to make mounts easier. (If I go with SNS, we split that responsibility. doesn't mean no other hunter mounts, of course.)  I like someone else's comment that what IG will bring to the table is that it doesn't need the jumping style, making it free to essentially have 2 (or 1.5) styles because it already has jump built in."

MonsterHunter,3dy19e,Anthan,2,Mon Jul 20 22:49:33 2015 UTC,"It could be to do with the Guild (legacy) style. If you remember the Famitsu scans when they spoke about hunting styles, they said that the Guild style would be like the original style everyone is used to, but there would be some enhancements. In the screens it showed an SnS with a hone-like glow.  This could be an extension of that - perhaps blue is some sort of team-buff, whereas red could be damage, etc. Obviously just speculation, as they didn't talk about it in the stream, but I imagine they'll explain it in that week in August."

MonsterHunter,3e3o5h,Suck_A_Turd,2,Tue Jul 21 18:35:29 2015 UTC,"In terms of Akantor weapons, it's useful to know that they all follow the gimmick of very, very high raw and affinity, with very little sharpness (as in, they only reach a maximum of blue with Sharpness +1). Sharpness not only prevents bouncing, but is the most useful damage multiplyer in the game. Purple sharpness multiplies raw by 1.45, as opposed to the 1.20  multiplier for blue. So they aren't as powerful as the numbers suggest because you miss out on damage from the low sharpness.  As for what to use it on, the Akantor weapons most widely used are the Hunting Horn, the Charge Blade and the Bow. None of those are weapons you use at the moment, so it might be better to save it for later if you decide to take up one of those weapons. PLEASE do not make the DS, because they are pretty awful due to poor sharpness and lack of element.  Also be aware that after completing the HR7 Quest Advanced: Akantor Coup, you can trade it and an Accolade for an Ukanlos Gem, which may be of more use to you.  As a final note, once you are accomplished at slaying it quickly, Akantor is a good source of money, because all of its parts sell for a lot, and the Caravan quest is not too difficult once you progress a bit further in the game. Heck, you can even farm it multiplayer if you want, so you may end up with stacks of Gems. By which I mean don't be afraid to use it on something you aren't sure about, because you may end up getting quite a few more."
MonsterHunter,3e3o5h,Dysprosium_164,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:24:16 2015 UTC,"Lucky... I didn't get my first Akantor Gem until G Rank.  But either way, if you look at the weapons in the Forge, you'll see some are listed as costing 99,999 zenny. This signifies that they are better than the others.   The best weapons are   GS (depends on preference)  SA (because of the Mind's Eye in sword form)  CB (because of high raw)  HH (because of High raw and good songs)  HBG (because it is strong)  The Akantor weapons universally have low sharpness and high affinity. To get the most out of them, you should at least have Mind's Eye (which is why the SA is good, because of the sword mode Mind's Eye), and the best skill for them would be Sharpness +1. This would get their final upgrade to Blue Sharpness.  So some shine, and some do not. I would advise you hold off on using them, since they only stay good temporarily, until you upgrade them."

MonsterHunter,3e2gzo,maniack_,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:26:43 2015 UTC,"It is a matter of efficiency & it's not that boring TBH. I just consider it the only way to do it. I don't want to do 30+ min  GQs with random shit weapons that i can do in 3 minutes with Hame, specially cause all i want from those quests are the relics themselves. Ofc hame is not something you'll do all day, cause then it gets tedious.  P.S. Now i have always been LBG in Hame runs, using the Kettleblower (Best material efficiency, hardest lbg to control the monsters with) & as an LBG it is quite fun & tense, there is a shit ton of tension every time the monster takes half a second more to fall on apex or when you think your trap might be placed a few cm away from where it should or when you see that freaking bnahabra is going to blow up the bombs before the HBGs are ready.

HAME is fast and easily regulated for higher chances of success and thus more often presents the rewards. Relics are extremely tedious to farm in comparison to rare drops. Increasing your output of rewards is similar to how a person would repeatedly hatch hundreds and even thousands of eggs in pokemon to get a perfect Shiny with maximum stats, benificial nature, and correct ability."

IF THE LBG APPROACHS YOU AND KICKS YOU OUT OF CROUCH FIRE YOU PROBABLY SHOULD MOVE TO WHERE EVERYONE ELSE IS  There is people that crouchs so close that as an lbg you have to do tricks to not get him with the small barrel bomb + blast when waking up the monster after you go kick him & he stays on the same place.

MonsterHunter,3e2gzo,Laxaria,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:43:15 2015 UTC,"Standard courtesy like giving some materials to the LBG. Even with low maintenance LBG's, you run very fast through fishes, spider webs, genprey fangs, etc. Tipping is a great thing to do and helps your fellow LBGer keep doing the awesome job.   This has NEVER happened to me as LBGer.   we fail the run and they BLAME THE LBG!!!   Happens a lot too. Never mind the fact that I nail the 6 frame window to keep a raged Rajang stationary.  In general, most random rooms are average. Average in the sense that a typical Stygian+Raj run may be about 3 minutes, which isn't too bad. I've hit faster kill times with better players and more consistent players, reaching something like 2:30 with the Heavendoll.  If you're the LBGer, and the HBGers screw up, just make a new room. HBGers are far and plentiful.  I personally also refuse to HAME a quest I don't host unless it is a friend. If you're a HBGer, do not expect a LBGer to level your quest or run it. A LBGer may. I personally refuse to out of principle.  The fact of the matter is that it is very obvious when the LBG screws up. However, more often than not, the HBGers are the ones who determine the success of a run. An average LBGer should have enough consistency to control a monster fairly well, even if it means letting Rajang leap backwards into a Pitfall. The HBGers determine the success of a run in a majority of cases."
MonsterHunter,3e2gzo,fodes96,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:43:09 2015 UTC,"The HBGers determine the success of a run in a majority of cases.   And that's why they must understand why the LBG is the boss and if he says that you are not properly placed, you must move."
MonsterHunter,3e2gzo,fodes96,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:46:57 2015 UTC,"The mentality of most HBGers is ""lol shooting is easy I don't need to do shit.""  Realistically though, I just make new rooms. If a group can't even clear Stygian I don't even bother sticking around. Wasting my time & resources is not something I want to do."
MonsterHunter,3e2gzo,HeatIce,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:48:34 2015 UTC,"The problem is that most of the monsters, even Rajang, are pretty forgiving to subpar damage. But Rajang is in Apex at 140 and you NEED to do your shit properly.  We host our HAME runs and end kicking nerds that do stupid things like what I said. But it baffles me when I see a guy that clearly has a lot of hame runs behind and yet doesn't know how to position. Like, after 4-5 times you should already know everything as HBG."

It is very unlikely that you show up in this room and everyone is in sync and it won't be as fast or as smooth as you see on some streams or videos.  Sometimes shit goes wrong with PuGs. Don't be a dick, explain what needs to happen even if it is tedious to type on the 3ds - no one benefits from people raging out and such. Then 'el boot or leave in my opinion. Own up if you messed up by shooting through the mob and hitting your LBG'r or something If someone doesn't have the right skills, let them know and properly give them the el' boot if they can't produce. You can make good HBG hame sets SOLO (grand mutsu can easily be farmed offline which is majority of hame gear).  I disagree with the point of changing gear. Create a hot saying for 'HAME ROOM' and if they take more than a minute, 'el boot.    Anyways, TL;DR Don't be a dick and lower your expectations"

MonsterHunter,3e30rc,Ivalia,7,Tue Jul 21 15:55:33 2015 UTC,"Pings don't work in text posts; only in comments.  I cannot give an exact time improvement. What I can say is that I never really bothered with Dash Juice until I tried it once or twice and I haven't really stopped using it since then. It makes a huge difference in solo play IMO.   It's a convenience factor. It also leads to developing some not-so-good habits, something I notice myself.  It really comes down to how well you make use of that stamina. Qualitatively it feels a bit nicer to have that leeway for error in stamina management. Quantitatively unless you are constantly depleting your stamina bar I do not feel that the improvement is that significant. For some monsters, depleting that stamina bar can be quite quick. For other monsters you may not have that many opportunities to really make use of that stamina. I am, of course, assuming superior positioning skills; the more you need to roll the more likely you'll deplete your stamina.  I am not convinced it is mandatory to use the Bow outside of very specific situations, like constantly throwing Power Shots, which is not all that common an occurrence IMO. Dash Juice gives you all the leeway in the world to ignore your stamina, which eases some of the mental work in using the Bow. At the end of the day it's nice to have and opens up more room for error (at the cost of developing some less than ideal habits with excessive dependence, mainly holding shots for too long and committing the sunk cost fallacy)."

MonsterHunter,3e306m,GinghamLion,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:51:27 2015 UTC,"Practically every monster has a spot you can hit without bouncing even at Blue or White sharpness. The issue is being able to hit them consistently and knowing when and how to hit them, which is often the hard part to master.  Sharpness+1 is probably not as integral to the Akantor CB as it may seem, because Sharpness levels do not impact the Impact Phial bursts. Focusing on stacking Raw (AuXL/Ch+2) is a good idea, as well as Razor Sharp to preserve some of that sharpness. Guard+2/Guard Up can be nice, and Artillery Novice is mandatory."
MonsterHunter,3e306m,Laxaria,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:57:40 2015 UTC,I read somewhere that attack up skills don't have as big of an impact on this weapon. Is there any truth to that? Is that why so many people hone it for life?
MonsterHunter,3e306m,Laxaria,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:07:23 2015 UTC,"Possibly. The Life Hone does have a benefit of keeping your life topped up during all the chip damage from guard points and what not.   I'm personally not too familiar with the precise mechanics myself, unfortunately."
MonsterHunter,3e306m,Arterra,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:08:44 2015 UTC,"Put it this way: impact phials are a percentage of raw, so the less base raw a weapon has the more benefit you get from added raw. Since Akantor CB has the highest raw possible it technically also benefits the least from it.   That said honing for life is usually a technique used to never stop attacking (no need to sheath and heal) rather than a lack of options. An attack honed Akantor CB is actually one of the few weapons that 100% outdamages max damage relics and hey every little bit helps since axe attacks are still useful."

MonsterHunter,3e306m,IcenEdelia,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:59:43 2015 UTC,"I would keep Sharpness +1, especially if you don't run Mind's Eye. You can get phials by repeatedly bouncing off of a monster, but needless to say, that's a stupid way to get phials. Two sets I absolutely love with the Akantor CB are the typical Honed Blade/Razor Sharp/Challenger +2 set (Easy to get Artillery Novice on top) and Star Knight, because it gives you literally everything you could ever need with 11+ slots to get extra skills (Attack Up, Artillery Novice, Guard, etc.).  I run a mixed set that uses Star Knight pieces for my Akantor CB and I have amazing hunt times with it. It's the perfect Charge Blade for expeditions IMO."
MonsterHunter,3e2yjj,takutotsuna,2,Tue Jul 21 15:39:21 2015 UTC,"Seregios GS actually has a few unique options to it.   The obvious solution is to just build a focus and crit draw set and stack as much raw damage as you can.  While its a decent sword it certainly lacks in the actual damage compared to other swords, so while you dont need sharpness+1 you instead focus on attack up and misc bonus skills like challenger or weakness exploit. Oh, and while not necessary razor sharp is absolutely amazing if you sheath and run a lot more than you roll.   The second option is to go for a more... Full offense set. Since you only regain sharpness when rolling unsheathed you can build around constantly repositioning with rolls to get constant charges with no sheath downtime. For casual hunts crit draw is better but for teams that create huge downtime for combos you outdamage the GS meta by ditching crit draw in favor if more attacks and other skills. This is also where life honing shines due to never having to sheath and heal, and believe me that first experiencing an evade distance GS set making things get crazy.  (Though not necessary it helps like HBG).   A not on life hone: it is not a replacement for attack hone when combined with peak performance. The raw boost is the same but you are trading constant damage output for the possibility that a konchu or slight leg movement can at any moment temporarily weaken you. Life hone should exclusively be used for constant offense rather than a bandaid for attack hone wannabe (even if it helps)."
MonsterHunter,3e2yjj,Arterra,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:55:57 2015 UTC,"Crit Draw and Focus are going to be your core skills. Quick Sheath is a useful skill, even more so through Sheath Control, which gives you Punishing Draw, a fun but not strictly necessary skill.  Seregios weapons love Razor Sharp/Steady Hand, since their purple is so short, but you might be able to get away without it since GS attacks so infrequently vs how much it rolls.  Challenger+2, Attack Up, Unscathed if you can maintain it, all skills that can boost your damage output.  Basically plug a few combinations into Athena's and see what you can manage with your talismans.  Tremor Res and HGE are also good situationally, for specialized sets."

MonsterHunter,3e2on1,-Lubber-,5,Tue Jul 21 14:24:01 2015 UTC,"Bows are stronger in 4U than 3U.  3U bows were fairly underpowered.  However the terrain change does add some complications to aiming.  Also, IG is an extremely strong weapon for all monsters, while the bow has strong clear times in a lot of things but can be weak vs others.  For example Seregios bow vs Seregios or Chameleos don't do too well, and Kushala can be tricky too if you are not great at aiming"
MonsterHunter,3e2on1,Ivalia,10,Tue Jul 21 14:40:17 2015 UTC,"However, in MH4U, I feel that the bows have gotten weaker comparatively.   No.   I mained IG for the entire way up to G-Crown and have recently switched to bows. Made myself a good set with All the skills appropriately using the Bow Guides on here for reference as to what was necessary and what was optional (shoutout thanks to /u/Laxaria [1] ) and I still feel weak!   Pray tell, how many hunts do you have on an IG?  Now, pray tell, how many hunts do you have with a Bow?  The Bow is a weapon with one of the highest skill floors in the game. The IG may take maybe 5-15 hours to become proficient and effective with. To match the IG's kill times, you need to spend maybe some 25-50 hours. I have over 1,000 Bow hunts in 4U and I will never claim myself to be a master with the Bow. There is always room for improvement.  What I do know, from my experience, is that the Bow is one of the strongest weapons in the game, and it shows. In Speedruns, it is one of the fastest, paling to few weapon set-ups. In a vacuum, the Bow excels at what it does.    I did a comparison test last night with a few friends in a hunt. Took out the bow set with power and c.r. coatings, a solid 95% of my shots were in critical range, and I made sure to study the damage charts for weakspots and aimed for those the entire time. Cleared the quest in about 8 minutes give or take. Switched to my IG main set (yayyy Hellruin) and cleared the same quest in under 5 minutes with the same team.   Once again, you are comparing a weapon that you have used countlesslessly, that you've ""mained,"" to a weapon that you have just picked up with limited experience. I do not care that you played 650 hours of MH3U with the Bow. I did the same in P3rd with some 700-800 hunts with the Bow, and I sucked so damn hard when I started 4U.  The measure of a Bow user's success is not ""how many coats I used."" It is not ""95% of my shots were in critical range."" I highly doubt that you ""aimed for those weakspots the entire time,"" and if you did, you probably fired a small amount of potential shots. I highly doubt that you exploited every opening that was available to you.   In fact, for all anyone else here knows you took the Bow to hunt Chameleos, a monster that is well known as a very Raw-resistant monster that you are better not taking the Kama out on.   Am I simply doing something wrong? Am I missing something about this wonderful weapon? Or is it really the case that bows just aren't as viable a weapon choice in 4U as they were in 3? Any thoughts would be appreciated my fellow hunters!   You're just wrong, because you expect to achieve similar kill times with a weapon you've used extensively (the IG) when using a weapon you have not (the Bow), and are too lazy to put in the time and effort to master a weapon to proficiency. You are making a blanket statement about the strength of a weapon based off anecdotal experience.  More specifically, the viability of the bow is terrible for you. For me though, I am incredibly comfortable with it. In my hands it is an incredibly viable weapon.   The Bow is as strong as the player. The largest reason for feeling the Bow is weak has absolutely nothing to do with the weapon, and everything to do with the player.  I wish we can all stop all of this ""This weapon is terrible because I cannot get the same kill times as I could with a weapon I've used over 600+ times"" mentality. If you truly want to make an evaluation of the viability of the Bow, make the effort to match the number of times you've hunted with the IG first."

Try to do that comparison solo, and don't forget to compare two smooth runs."
MonsterHunter,3e2on1,Blinc0,3,Tue Jul 21 14:30:01 2015 UTC,"The bow has a very solid damage output, but pretty much anything that isn't a Great Sword or a HBG will look weak compared to the Insect Glaive, especially if you have more recent experience with the latter. The best speed run times for lvl140 Rajang are 8:54 for the bow and 7:51 for the IG, for example, so once you get back in the groove the power gap should shrink down."
MonsterHunter,3e2on1,TacticianRobin,3,Tue Jul 21 14:53:40 2015 UTC,"Did you get more mounts the second time around, since you used the IG? 10+ seconds of sustained damage by 4 people can definitely shorten up a quest.  That's my only real thought, other than yeah IG is one of the strongest weapons in the game. Best to try to compare solo, and don't expect Bow (or most weapons) to have the same kill times as Glaive."
MonsterHunter,3e2on1,Aninymouse3,2,Tue Jul 21 15:02:23 2015 UTC,"This is important. Good archers don't mount much. On certain maps, you might get lucky and mount once, but most of the time, an archer needs to focus on killing the monster, and moving in such a way as to do so. The Glaive can focus on mounting while killing, and doesn't need to change it's strategy or positioning much in order to do so. Bow needs the monster right next to the ledge.  By G rank, the Bow also probably will have to land 2-3 mount attacks before they can mount even the first time. That's not realistic.  What this means is that Bows don't get that ""free"" DPS from downing a monster."
MonsterHunter,3e2on1,Arterra,-1,Tue Jul 21 15:51:27 2015 UTC,"I try to stay away from mounting as much as possible because it actually slows times down. You lose DPS overall by taking time away from when your team could be exploiting openings to try and create a 10 second opening where you could just as easily focus damage and topple a monster without sacrificing DPS and get the same opening :P A lot of peoples' mistakes when using the IG is too much mounting..unless you're trying to save other teammates, that is. In which case, mount spam.   And I wouldn't expect them to have exactly the same, but at least somewhere similar. I consider myself competent with bow as it was a main weapon choice for me in the third gen and I wouldn't have expected the time for a kill to drop by nearly half when switching to a weapon I know fairly well."
MonsterHunter,3e2on1,Aninymouse3,2,Tue Jul 21 15:43:34 2015 UTC,"Your questions and fears have been answered.  I would just like to reiterate one basic fact however: everything is viable, if you don't think a particular weapon is then you are bad (at it).  In fact the term ""viable"" is still too soft to convey the message: while each weapon has strengths and weaknesses they are each fully capable in the hands of an expert to wreck face."
MonsterHunter,3e2on1,Laxaria,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:45:03 2015 UTC,"Bows can be good at applying status in some situations, with the right armor setup, weapon, and monster.  Nothing will ever be better at spamming status than the LBG or Dual Blades.  Bow certainly does better than the Greatsword at applying status.  Status really is only relevant in solo hunts if you're using Poison against certain monsters, or sleep bombing. In groups, status can help the whole team, so it becomes worth using. Still, if the team you have isn't good at fighting as a team, then that won't mean much...  The most applications you're going to get, with a coating boost, combines for more shots, Status +2, Status Crit, and positive affinity, is about 3-4 applications per hunt. That's pretty near top-tier. If you just slap on a status coating without any of that, you might get 1 application -- 2 if the monster is weak to that status or you brought combines for more."
MonsterHunter,3e2on1,Aninymouse3,2,Tue Jul 21 16:00:17 2015 UTC,"The most applications you're going to get, with a coating boost, combines for more shots, Status +2, Status Crit, and positive affinity, is about 3-4 applications per hunt. That's pretty near top-tier.   The opportunity cost is too high to do that though, honestly.  If you truly stack Status then yes, the Bow can be a good status weapon. However, if you truly stack Status, even the GS can be a good status weapon. On the other hand, you don't depend on a GS to reliably status something.  It's sort of the same idea with the Bow. Status Coats are nice and useful on the side as something additive to damage. It really should not be something you should focus on IMO. If you really want a status-centric playstyle, the LBG, SnS and Dual Blades all offer a status-centric option without sacrificing too much in damage.  Getting Status +2, Status Crit and some additional affinity means you are less likely to stack on the skills that let the Bow's numerous raw multipliers shine. There is also the opportunity cost of not being able to use Power Coats when using Status Coats.  If you take maybe 5-6 shots to Paralyze a monster, you could've also spent those 5-6 shots using Power Coat."
MonsterHunter,3e2on1,TheRetroPanda,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:15:53 2015 UTC,"I'm not arguing with that. You're correct. My point was just to lay out the reality of what it means to use status with Bows. What conclusions we derive from this reality depends on the person viewing the facts.  I think most people would conclude that status on the Bow is not worth it most of the time.  But, on some monsters, status trumps raw damage in a group. I'd argue that all forms of Kushala Daora are this way, unless you are good enough (and have a good enough relic to) hame the thing with high dragon element."
MonsterHunter,3e2on1,ReiheiArai,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:01:37 2015 UTC,How does one bow? I've never figured out that weapon and always just opted for the HBG (which is much easier for me to use IMO).
