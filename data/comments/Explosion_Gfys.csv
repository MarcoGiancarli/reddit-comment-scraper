You hear about stars being balls of burning gas but there isn't much gas, and there is no burning. The ""gas"" is actually in plasma state, and the heat and fire comes from fusion reactions. This explosion is likely caused by a magnetic fluctuation in the sun's corona.   The sun's magnet field is constantly ""boiling"" and twisting about violently. This often leads to events such as these. Known as coronal mass ejections the magnetic fluctuation makes the sun spit out a bit of its corona."

This phase was predicted theoretically in 1935,  but has not been reliably produced in laboratory experiments due to the requirement of high pressures, on the order of hundreds of gigapascals. At these pressures, hydrogen might exist as a liquid rather than solid. Liquid metallic hydrogen is thought to be present in large amounts in the gravitationally compressed interiors of Jupiter, Saturn, and in some of the newly discovered extrasolar planets.

The second wave is caused by reflection of the blast wave from the ground, this eventually joins the first wave as it slows down, eventually it will slow down enough to be sub sonic and then will be called a soundwave. If you could see the wave travelling along the ground you would see this phenomenon, in this state it's called a precursive wave and was first observed during testing of atomic weapons in Nevada during the 40's. The precursive wave has a lot more pushing/destructive power than a typical shockwave due to the wave front being constantly added to by successive pressure waves."

I remember my step-dad (prior Army) saying, ""You need to watch this, boy. Now this is what we should have done in the first place."" That and, ""They should have let us finish the job so you kids wouldn't have to."""
Explosion_Gfys,3by7h2,Really_Dont_Know,1 point,Fri Jul 3 06:50:42 2015 UTC,That is an incredibly ignorant thing to say. My step-father is not a stupid man. His perspective then is not what it is today. Information wasn't as easy to come by as it is now. I was just recalling a memory I had. That doesn't in any way sum up the amount of intelligence that this man has.
Explosion_Gfys,3by7h2,Really_Dont_Know,2,Fri Jul 3 12:32:12 2015 UTC,Your step dad was right. They should have gone into Iraq and finished it. There was enough positive sentiment within Iraq to hold the country together and a lot more opposition to the Baathist regime than during the 2003 invasion. By encouraging that and expressing a desire to help then not following through it gave Saddam the knowledge of who his opponents and detractors were and he wiped them out. Of course if Paul Bremner hadn't fired the police and army in totality then there wouldn't have been so many problems after the '03 invasion either.
Explosion_Gfys,3by7h2,Really_Dont_Know,2,Fri Jul 3 12:51:59 2015 UTC,"That was always his biggest regret. Actually, even my Dad and my Uncle regret what happened; they were Army as well. It's not like they really had a choice, but it still bothers all of them that they went in saying they were going to help, but they didn't. It was never the plan and they didn't know that at the time. So it kinda haunts them. In that respect his perspective changed, because they were told they were going to liberate Kuwait from Iraq then take out Saddam. After lie after lie from his time to my time; he just feels everyone would have been better off if we hadn't gotten involved."
Explosion_Gfys,3by7h2,Really_Dont_Know,2,Fri Jul 3 13:11:18 2015 UTC,"There really was no choice for the international community to get involved. Saddam would have taken any sign that the UN wasn't prepared to invade as an OK to take out Saudi and the Gulf States next. What should really piss you and everyone else off is the OK to invade Kuwait Saddam got from US ambassador April Glaspie. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/April_Glaspie     Some people argue that it's twisting her language but it's diplomatic speak, of course you twist it to get the meaning."
Explosion_Gfys,3by7h2,eleitl,2,Fri Jul 3 13:32:25 2015 UTC,"That's exactly the point. There were so many lies and cover ups before, during, and since after that it's getting harder to determine how much is due to poor communication, incompetence, or strategic (non)action. Every bit of it pisses me off. Sometimes, if I didn't know any better, I'd think all this chaos was manufactured. Sometimes, I'm not sure I do know any better."

Explosion_Gfys,3an2ia,MyShamefulShit,6,Mon Jun 22 07:21:54 2015 UTC,Kamikazes were just Imperial Japanese aircraft that were carrying a bomb on a hard point and if possible some more explosives inside the aircraft. The explosion is actually from the munitions aboard the John Burke detonating simultaneously from the fire caused by the kamikaze. It was an ammunition transport ship I believe was headed towards Okinawa.

The ship was named for John Burke (February 25, 1859 – May 14, 1937), the 10th Governor of North Dakota. Burke was built at Kaiser Shipbuilding Company's Oregon Shipbuilding yard in Portland, Oregon. Burke's keel was laid November 20, 1942  and 33 days later, on December 13,  the hull was launched. After fitting-out over the following ten days, Burke was delivered to the US Navy December 23.  The Navy placed Burke under charter to Northland Transportation Company in early 1944.

The campaign consisted of a three-pronged attack, with the two main assaults spearheaded by Ahrar ash-Sham, al-Qaeda-affiliated Jabhat al-Nusra and other Islamist factions under the banner of the Army of Conquest, and the remaining attack force including collaboration with Free Syrian Army brigades.   The commander of the FSA 13th Division stated that coordinating with other groups such as al-Nusra Front did not mean they were aligned with them.  Within days, the rebels captured the city of Jisr al-Shughur and later on an Army base.  The success of the campaign was attributed to better coordination between the Syrian opposition's backers.   Still, the operation resulted in a high attrition rate for both sides.

By having the two blasts detonate simultaneously he is able to focus the blasts together into the center of the road, this process is also used in mining to increase the cracking power of shots. It's the same theory that Rods from God would use to create small earthquakes radiating inwards towards the target army. When they reach the center they are much more powerful then a single charge equating the same input force would be. Physics, gotta love it."

Explosion_Gfys,394s14,KingofCoconuts,2,Tue Jun 9 06:47:01 2015 UTC,"My grandfather used to do this after the war in Germany. He lived next to a rather big lake (Starnberger See/ Lake Starnberg) a few miles from Munich. They used all kinds of chemicals /left over munitions, creating charges and throwing them into the water. He said if you got the amount of explosives and the depth of it just right, you could kill a good amount of fish in a 30 meter radius. However, they had to stop doing this, as they got busted a few times by the local police and a friend of his lost four fingers while building one of the charges. Afterwards, they used batteries and other electrical components to fry the fish underwater, which didn't work as well, but, according to him, was still more efficient than using a fishing rod."

Explosion_Gfys,386wwz,redmercuryvendor,2,Tue Jun 2 19:16:07 2015 UTC,It's more for vehicle peneteation. It is one of the most powerful warheads fired by infantry. I don't think there's a tank that it couldn't defeat bar active protection systems like Trophy.
Explosion_Gfys,386wwz,redmercuryvendor,2,Wed Jun 3 03:14:54 2015 UTC,"This is actually a different type of tandem charge warhead. The one you are thinking of ejects two EFPs; one to defeat passive (e.g. spaced plates, 'slat armour', cages, etc) or stationary active (e.g. ERA) protection systems and the second to penetrate the actual armour. This warhead is designed to defeat those protections, but only for 'soft skinned' targets. The second charge physically penetrates the armour (with some assistance from the initial EFP), so can only penetrate a small amount of armour without being catastrophically deformed. It's main purpose is to be very effective against large softly armoured volumes (e.g. buildings), hence the second charge is a fragmentation warhead inside the target rather than an EFP outside it.  Note that the target object here is a relatively thin brick wall. Even a very simple fragmentation warhead could probably penetrate it unassisted."

It was a small satellite designed to test the launch capabilities of the three-stage Vanguard and study the effects of the environment on a satellite and its systems in Earth orbit. It was also to be used to obtain geodetic measurements through orbit analysis.  At its launch attempt on December 6, 1957 at Cape Canaveral, the booster ignited and began to rise; but about two seconds after liftoff, after rising about four feet (1.2 m), the rocket lost thrust and began to fall back to the launch pad. As it settled the fuel tanks ruptured and exploded, destroying the rocket and severely damaging the launch pad. The Vanguard satellite was thrown clear and landed on the ground a short distance away with its transmitters still sending out a beacon signal. The satellite was damaged, however, and could not be reused. It is now on display at the National Air and Space Museum of the Smithsonian Institution.   The exact cause of the accident was never determined with certainty due to limited telemetry instrumentation at this early phase,  but Martin-Marietta concluded that low fuel tank pressure during the start procedure allowed some of the burning fuel in the    Image i     Interesting: Vanguard (rocket) | Vanguard TV3BU | Project Vanguard | Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Launch Complex 18   Parent commenter can toggle NSFW or delete.

Explosion_Gfys,2xxe37,forte2,3,Wed Mar 4 17:40:57 2015 UTC,"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTAViMX-w6c http://www.historynet.com/uss-franklin-struck-by-a-japanese-dive-bomber-during-world-war-ii.htm     Up on the bridge, navigator Jurika started scribbling in his log. Franklin turned into the wind and cranked up to 24 knots, ready for launch. At 6:57 a.m. the first Corsair was airborne. At 7:05, Jurika heard a scratchy message on the TBS (talk between ships) radio from the carrier Hancock: Enemy plane closing on you…one coming toward you!     At that moment, logged at 7:07, Commander Jurika saw an enemy plane sweep over his head. It was a Japanese Yokosuka D4Y Judy dive bomber, and it dropped two 500-pound bombs on Franklin. The twin blasts hurled Jurika into the air, and he hit the steel overhead. The first bomb ripped through 3-inch armor to the hangar deck. The second bomb detonated two decks below that, near the chief petty officers' quarters. The explosions knocked Captain Gehres off his feet. He saw great sheets of flame envelope the flight deck, the anti-aircraft batteries and catwalks. The forward elevator — weighing 32 tons — rose in the air and then disappeared in a great column of flame and black smoke. Five bombers, 14 torpedo bombers and 12 fighters were on the flight and hangar decks, carrying 36,000 gallons of gas and 30 tons of bombs and rockets between them. They became an inferno. Franklin was listing at 13 degrees. Her radar was out, her CIC and communications gone. Gehres thought his ship was damaged on the starboard side and turned Franklin in that direction to put the wind on the port bow. That move instead fanned flames near the fueled aircraft. Franklin presented a terrifying sight to the rest of Task Force 58. On a battleship 1,000 yards off, crewmen stared in horror at the carrier covered in smoke and flame. Marine Corporal Bill Clinger saw the Judy that had bombed Franklin whiz over his head. Lieutenant Scotty Campbell saw Franklin's bombs and rockets exploding in all directions. One observer reacted immediately to the situation. A Corsair orbiting Franklin swooped down on the Judy and shot it down. In Franklin's engine room, the black gang (stokers, so-called from the grime of coal soot) were able to keep the boilers running. To Ensign William B. Hayler, the bomb impacts were like a giant sledgehammer had been cut loose on the deck above us. As the ship heeled over, Seaman 2nd Class S. Aaron Gill slid down oily grates and somehow managed to cut back the superheat-1,200 pounds per square inch-to reduce the oil supply to the fires. The engine crew was trapped. Jurika suggested Gehres turn Franklin into the wind. Gehres put Franklin on course 355, due north, which put relative wind on the starboard bow and allowed firefighters to work fore to aft. It also put Franklin on a 24-knot course directly toward Japan. But there was no time to think about that. A 3-inch gasoline line aft had ruptured. Bombs, rockets, and .50-caliber ammunition were still exploding. Then a 40mm ready-service magazine exploded. This new blast lifted Franklin and spun her to starboard. A sheet of flame rose 400 feet over the carrier, rupturing the flight deck in a dozen places. Tiny Tims were flying in all directions. As Commander Taylor later recalled: Some screamed by to starboard…some to port and some straight up the flight deck. The weird aspect of this weapon whooshing by so close is one of the most awful spectacles a human has ever been privileged to see. Some went straight and some tumbled end over end. Each time one went off, the firefighting crews forward would instinctively hit the deck…their heroism was the greatest thing I have ever seen. The heroes were not all on Franklin. The destroyers Miller and Hickox moved within several hundred feet of Franklin and played hoses on the damaged ship. At 7:41, a Japanese Mitsubishi Zero fighter was reported diving on the carrier. Determined flak brought her into the sea. At about 9:20, Santa Fe blinkered Franklin to ask if the carrier's magazines were flooded. We believe the magazines are flooded, Big Ben answered. Am not sure. The water valves were on, but the pipes had split. No water had reached the hundreds of tons of explosives stored in the after magazines. Nobody knew that.     It would take another two days to put the fires out, eventually Big Ben would reach Ulithi and be able to drop anchor, ending one of the most harrowing incidents to ever happen to an aircraft carrier."

Conducted in northern Queensland, Australia by a joint Australian-American-British team, it was designed to simulate the effects of a nuclear weapon on tropical rainforest, using 50 tons of conventional explosive (TNT).  A device containing 50 tons of TNT was detonated to partially simulate a ten kiloton air burst in the Iron Range jungle of the Cape York Peninsula. The explosives were sourced from obsolete artillery shells and placed in a tower 42 metres (138 ft) above ground level and 21 metres (69 ft) above the rainforest canopy. After the explosion, troops were moved through the area (which was now covered in up to a metre of leaf litter), to test their ability to transit across the debris. In addition, obsolete vehicles and equipment left near the centre of the explosion were destroyed.  The explosion was intended by the Robert Menzies government to test and examine the feasibility of air burst nuclear weapons for clearing forests and the use of mangled forests to slow troop movement in South East Asia, primarily Indonesia and Malaysia in the escalation of the time against Sukarno and the Konfrontasi Malayan Emergency. There was also a view to use such techniques in the later Myanmar conflict and Vietnam War, which were simmering at the time.

Explosion_Gfys,2tvejg,runedisc,1 point,Wed Jun 10 21:05:02 2015 UTC,"Superheated water:       Superheated water is liquid water under pressure at temperatures between the usual boiling point, 100 °C (212 °F) and the critical temperature, 374 °C (705 °F). It is also known as ""subcritical water"" or ""pressurized hot water."" Superheated water is stable because of overpressure that raises the boiling point, or by heating it in a sealed vessel with a headspace, where the liquid water is in equilibrium with vapour at the saturated vapor pressure. This is distinct from the use of the term superheating to refer to water at atmospheric pressure above its normal boiling point, which has not boiled due to a lack of nucleation sites (sometimes experienced by heating liquids in a microwave).

There is an enormous amount of pressure. There are mine locks on all the doors and if they aren't locked the doors will all pop open. Everything not tied down flies. Terrible headaches. The worst part is the suffocating dust in the truck. Takes about five minutes to settle. The smell is absolutely awful depending on the type of IED. The front ends usually shear off so you sit at an awkward angle. You lose power so the radios go out. The AC goes out so it starts getting really hot and sweaty. There is usually a terrible 30 seconds before they can communicate their situation. It's kinda like NASCAR crashes. Sometimes they look awful and everyone makes it out. Sometimes they look minor and everyone dies from the pressure. It's a game of inches. Recovery is the worst part. I've missed dinner chow so many times because of late in the mission IED strikes."

Explosion_Gfys,2q9snu,cactusiscooler,3,Mon Apr 13 16:09:37 2015 UTC,"You're right about the angle. They're doing a combat take off which entails gaining height as quickly as possible to evade any missiles. I have no doubt that this is what caused the cargo to break free. The weight calculation for the fuel is a normal part of every flight, it's distributed evenly throughout the wings and body to give an even CG and is pumped in an order so weight isn't unbalanced."

Attached to the rocket motor 250 mm L9 53 kg is a 228 m long hose packed with 1455 kg of pe6/al explosive. After the hose lands on the ground it detonates and destroys over 90% of mines along its entire length. The 10% that are not destroyed are simply pushed aside to safety. It can be used in tandem to defeat double impulse mines or mines of greater depth. It also contains a 9 kg High explosive substitute at the end with a .9 kg booster of pe4.   Python has been used operationally with the Trojan AVRE in Afghanistan.  During Operation Moshtarak the Royal Engineers attempted to use this traditional mine clearance equipment in the Counter-IED role in support of a major British Army advance.

Explosion_Gfys,2jsvy5,autowikibot,1 point,Mon Oct 20 17:29:44 2014 UTC,"2S1 Gvozdika:       The 2S1 Gvozdika, (Russian: 2С1 «Гвоздика», 'Carnation'); is a Soviet 122-mm self-propelled howitzer that resembles the PT-76 but is essentially a lengthened version of the MT-LB APC, mounting the 2A18 howitzer. ""2S1"" is its GRAU designation. An alternative Russian designation is SAU-122 but in the Russian Army it is commonly known as Gvozdika. The 2S1 is fully amphibious with very little preparation, and once afloat is propelled by its tracks. A variety of wider tracks are also available to allow the 2S1 to operate in snow or swamp conditions. It is NBC protected and has infra-red night-vision capability.

Explosion_Gfys,2jrk76,forte2,2,Mon Oct 20 07:10:53 2014 UTC,"Do you know what kind of artillery is being used in these GFY's?  The airstrikes seem to be accurate (considering they're most likely guided rockets), but the artillery just seems.. Well, to put it bluntly, inaccurate as all hell. Some of the strikes are hitting more than 100m off intended target!"
Explosion_Gfys,2jrk76,Kanthes,2,Mon Oct 20 14:17:59 2014 UTC,No idea whatsoever. I'm going to guess it's going to be old US 122mm or 155mm although the fact that is seems more a TOT strike could mean that it was MLRS. I don't think that the Iraqis practice TOT with their towed pieces.

Explosion_Gfys,2jf6te,Kanthes,3,Thu Oct 16 14:51:36 2014 UTC,"The story behind this explosion is probably even more amusing than the GFY.  Leaving whale carcasses to rot is usually a bad idea (see /u/wholeein's earlier post), so they had the brilliant idea to blow it up using dynamite! The carcass would be disintegrated into smaller chunks which the sealife would eventually carry away.  ..or atleast, that was the plan.  They had no idea how much explosive to use. Which means they used much more than necessary. Which resulted in a whale being truly blown to the heavens, only to rain back down onto Earth in medium-sized (and well tenderized) chunks!  Luckily, the only casualty was a beautiful new car, which ended up being crushed by a chunk of whale crashing down from the sky. Whether or not the insurance company believed the owner is unknown."
