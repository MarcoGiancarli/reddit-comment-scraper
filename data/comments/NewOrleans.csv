You reserve a car online and then use the card they sent you in the mail to unlock it and go. At the location in the parking garage on o'keefe they have 3 prius's and a minivan.

NewOrleans,3e4kyb,Flyamese_Cat,2,Tue Jul 21 22:47:51 2015 UTC,Well CarShare isn't normally meant for daily rates but they have them just in case.  More of a tourist type thing to where they can just swipe and ride out to Metairie or something that may be to far for a cab.  If you plan on having a car all day or if you're a local leaving town you should just rent one online and have them deliver to your door.
NewOrleans,3e4kyb,MutantToenail,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:39:11 2015 UTC,Yes but I can pay $15 for three hours instead of $50 for a day. Why rent for a day when I just need to take my cat to the vet?

Try to get a PPO plan, not an HMO, if you can swing the price, because you can go out of network and still get covered with a PPO.    Louisiana health cooperative was also fine, but they're newer so doctors don't always know if they take them.   Edited for clarity: A PPO means you get to choose your own physician, as opposed to having to stay with one your insurance agrees to cover, and that you won't be penalized. This is mainly important if you have specialists you want to stay with."

On a similar note, the day I broke my hand and went to the ER, I had double insurance; United and whoever Starbucks used. Both of them denied coverage, saying the other one was responsible for the bill. The hospital ended up sending the $1,800 bill to collections months later; I've been giving them the finger since (not recommended, but I think it recently dropped off my credit report)."

Priest shouldn't have denied him because it's not his place to pass judgement in the house of god per Catholic dogma.  Both are in the wrong here.   Side note, this priest baptized my firstborn son (yes I'm originally from Amite) and made the entire homily for that particular mass about the importance of marriage and raising a child while married.

NewOrleans,3dyu7m,Spencypoo,2,Tue Jul 21 01:08:16 2015 UTC,Yeah I'm also episcopalian but whenever I went with Catholic friends to church I used to get communion no questions asked. It wasn't until later that a friend told me since I'm not Catholic and was never baptised I wasn't supposed to. But when my dad was at olol the nuns used to bring us communion even though they knew we were episcopalian. I suspect there is a lot of individual judgement going into it from both sides.

The parade was for the conference and likely just to give its attendees a fun experience. The protest that showed up to the parade was organized by an organization called the Debt Collective. They showed up, yelled at these financial aid administrators who have no control over the cost of education, and threw shit around. Don't be upset with the conference. It was some frustrated students venting to the wrong people while tossing paper around.  http://wwno.org/post/student-loan-protest-marks-financial-aid-conference"

There are still plenty of tourists but hasn't seemed like as many so if you want fewer people bogging your lines and walking areas down, August has that going for it. It is in the middle of storm season so that's def something to take into account in terms of travel. Find a pool. And a snoball. 👍🏻  Oh.

NewOrleans,3e02js,hikemogan,11,Mon Jul 20 22:36:01 2015 UTC,"Here's the deal: as a liberal arts major, your career path is not set -- and the career paths that seem the most sensible and obvious, like marketing writing and working in journalism, are extremely fucking competitive. You probably don't want to get involved in that mess unless you're ridiculously driven. The good news is there are all kinds of other jobs where people with your skillset are needed.  So what you need to do is find what jobs people are actually hiring for. Most likely you will have to round out your skillset with some software skills and an understanding of certain industries or audiences. The general office admin work helps position you for a lot of jobs, so that's a plus.   I say type your skills into Indeed and see what comes up. Don't limit yourself to writing jobs; look around and see what's there. I fell into my own industry, training, by complete accident, and it's proven very good to my English/Philosophy major skillset.   Find something that you think you can do without going absolutely bonkers and strive to fill out the requirements on the listing. You can't do anything about your inevitable experience gap, but you can quickly master software like Word, InDesign, or what have you with the help of lynda and 30-day trials. Industry knowledge can be obtained through mixers, linkedin groups, classes and the like. Ask around your school alumni network to see where people have ended up, too, because nepotism is just a thing and you've got to get used to it.   Then, from there, what you need to do is some kind of combination of shameless networking and resume padding, aka internships or volunteer work (what's the difference these days?). Get a clean, nice-looking portfolio up as soon as you can.   It'll be hard -- it's rough out there for millennials-- but eventually you'll get your breakthrough and for what it's worth, I have 0 regrets about getting my English major. It was quite fulfilling and I use it every single day."
NewOrleans,3e02js,lampadophoros,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:33:22 2015 UTC,"This is also my experience.  My combination of work and volunteer experience has gotten me my career in systems analysis.  I wouldn't have needed my degree to get my first jobs, but I wouldn't have been able to get my last 2 jobs without a bachelor's.  Mine is in political science, which is in a similar boat as you English folk.  Along the way, I picked up SQL, crystal reports, a little programming, etc, which only augmented my statistical analysis learning from college, making me perfect for this kind of job.  There's something in English that can do the same for you."
NewOrleans,3e02js,phacey,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:38:12 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the constructive advice and encouragement. It remains to be seen if journalism is worth pursuing seriously, and I'm sure that will be contingent on the success or failure of what I'm doing for the school this year.   I've taken not so stimulating internships for the purpose of shameless networking and figure I'll have to keep that up from here on out, and in the meantime keep working on my portfolio.   Just out of curiosity, how did you get into training?"

I doubt you can get a telecommute job for it straight out of college, but there's local places hiring for it, and after 2 years you can upgrade and work remotely.  Another option that I think a lot of english majors would be good at is corporate training. There's an art to preparing materials. I'm not sure how hot the job market for that is in New Orleans, though."

Sorry, but English degrees are worthless. I'm unfortunately speaking from personal experience here. I'd say law school is your best bet, but I understand there's already a glut of law students making those jobs tough to come by.  I'd encourage you to realize the likelihood of jobs opening up in those related fields are nil. You're better off doing your own thing as a side business/hobby, soliciting work via Internet ads and whatever connections you have. Freelancing is the name of the game from my experience. If and when something does open up, then you'll at least have a portfolio to show instead of just a degree all other candidates will already have.  Also realize that a lot of writing jobs are global now thanks to the Internet. Don't confine your search locally. Everyone I know (including myself) who has written ""professionally"" has done so for out-of-state businesses."

NewOrleans,3dyuat,MutantToenail,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:51:54 2015 UTC,Doesn't that take all the fun out of making your own list?
NewOrleans,3duoct,mrmojorisingi,13,Sun Jul 19 17:28:08 2015 UTC,"Former New Orleanian here in the UK.  Problem with the London Underground, is that heat gets trapped Underground and the air doesn't move.  It's more of a feeling of being suffocated"
NewOrleans,3duoct,vipergirl,10,Sun Jul 19 19:39:43 2015 UTC,Sitting in my backyard in broadmoor right now sweating like a banshee. Give me 73 degrees puhleazzzze. It's 101 right now......come to think of it....why am I outside.
NewOrleans,3duoct,Smelbe,2,Sun Jul 19 20:23:55 2015 UTC,You can drink beer outside and leave the A/C off until nighttime whereas if you stay indoors Entergy gonna pillage you.
NewOrleans,3duoct,Flyamese_Cat,3,Mon Jul 20 00:19:34 2015 UTC,Between me and you(and I guess the other 36 million reddit users) I am fairly certain I have a faulty meter. I keep the system at 72 and my bills are only 175 without leveled billing. Secret.
NewOrleans,3duoct,Smelbe,3,Mon Jul 20 00:38:34 2015 UTC,At my old place I left the thermostat on 76-78 during the hot times and 64 during the winter and would still somehow average $200 bills.  They just kinda make shit up and tell us if we don't like it we can get solar.
NewOrleans,3duoct,Flyamese_Cat,3,Mon Jul 20 00:57:07 2015 UTC,I keep mine on 69-71 year round and have never had to turn the heat on. $80/month. I think NASA insulated my building.
NewOrleans,3duoct,reeln166a,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:56:13 2015 UTC,You'd probably do better with improved insulation and new windows.

NewOrleans,3duoct,JohnTesh,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:26:16 2015 UTC,That storm was some shit. Wow
NewOrleans,3duoct,Smelbe,3,Mon Jul 20 21:34:00 2015 UTC,"On the north shore right now, 95.  Was 85 when I left the bar at 2 am last night."
NewOrleans,3duoct,MyUserNameTaken,9,Sun Jul 19 20:50:20 2015 UTC,It all depends on the weather you are accustomed to.
NewOrleans,3duoct,PoorlyShavedApe,6,Sun Jul 19 19:32:18 2015 UTC,"Exactly. People here are just as bad about the cold.   Anecdote: My friend and I were riding our bikes in Baton Rouge a while back, and some guy started yelling out of his truck ""IT'S TOO COLD FOR DEM BIKES."" It was ~60f, according to an electronic bank sign. The friend I was with is from New York and rides to work in sub-freezing temperatures all winter, so we've started to quote that to each other as a joke all the time."
NewOrleans,3duoct,Lady_Bernkastel,9,Sun Jul 19 22:01:03 2015 UTC,But with the humidity it probably FELT like 79
NewOrleans,3duoct,GhostPepperEater,7,Sun Jul 19 19:39:46 2015 UTC,73 sounds divine right now.
NewOrleans,3duoct,BossyBlossom,4,Sun Jul 19 18:42:49 2015 UTC,wat?
NewOrleans,3duoct,swamptech,2,Sun Jul 19 17:45:18 2015 UTC,"Right now, which is 3:30am GMT, it is 58 fuckin' degrees Fahrenheit. High temperature tomorrow there is 77!"
NewOrleans,3duoct,_iPhoney_,2,Mon Jul 20 02:31:28 2015 UTC,This sign is specifically advising people who are using the Underground transport system. It gets absolutely stifling down there. I imagine people pass out from the heat sometimes and this sign absolves TfL of any liability.
NewOrleans,3duoct,helypants,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:23:59 2015 UTC,"To be fair, most of the UK doesn't have air conditioning."
NewOrleans,3duoct,EPHomie,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:01:35 2015 UTC,Kinda like what the north thought when we shut the city down for 2 days bc of icy roads
NewOrleans,3duoct,popealope,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:44:02 2015 UTC,I laugh at the August tourists and their faces melting off!!!
NewOrleans,3duoct,spacedust666,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:42:45 2015 UTC,Any chance that was left up from a few weeks ago when it was 95 out?

NewOrleans,3duoct,razaeru,3,Sun Jul 19 18:29:02 2015 UTC,"In Texas we get 73 degrees in late October. Its what we define as ""cool weather"""
NewOrleans,3duf3t,PoorlyShavedApe,24,Sun Jul 19 16:06:52 2015 UTC,"Not usually a guy who points out typos but that should read 9 PM SEPT 19,2015."
NewOrleans,3duf3t,GhostPepperEater,9,Sun Jul 19 19:41:57 2015 UTC,Maybe after the heat death of the universe it'll finally cool off a bit
NewOrleans,3duf3t,daybreaker,4,Sun Jul 19 20:05:08 2015 UTC,This was getting into our truck just now http://imgur.com/XnMKidt
NewOrleans,3duf3t,absolutspacegirl,2,Sun Jul 19 21:33:30 2015 UTC,Ugh. It's only 95 and my AC cant keep up. It's supposed to be 98 some days next week.
NewOrleans,3duf3t,daybreaker,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:05:49 2015 UTC,Keep a fan on and put one in front of your AC unit.
NewOrleans,3duf3t,Galaxyhiker42,2,Mon Jul 20 04:28:47 2015 UTC,"Fuck the tourists, what about the homeless?"
NewOrleans,3duf3t,chuckWAGONhayes,21,Sun Jul 19 16:28:24 2015 UTC,They are more likely to know about the heat already.
NewOrleans,3duf3t,cholli8,27,Sun Jul 19 16:29:40 2015 UTC,And less likely to be browsing Reddit
NewOrleans,3duf3t,Galaxyhiker42,5,Sun Jul 19 17:57:32 2015 UTC,what else are the gutter punks looking at on their iPhones?
NewOrleans,3duf3t,NyctophobicParanoid,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:27:39 2015 UTC,"Not from the south so I'm genuinely curious - what do homeless people southern cities like NoLa do in weather like this?  I'm from the great white north, so our occasional summer heat wave outreach is pretty big since we don't really have a homeless population 2/3 of the year and that leaves the budget in good shape the rest of the year, but somewhere that's habitable all year round must have a hell of a time."
NewOrleans,3duf3t,LaDunkelCloset,5,Sun Jul 19 18:56:07 2015 UTC,"They stay in the shady areas and have adapted pretty well to it by now, hence why a 40 degree winter can be unbearable to some.  Some will feign mental health issues to go into a hospital for a while as well."
NewOrleans,3duf3t,Spencypoo,10,Sun Jul 19 18:59:24 2015 UTC,I don't think I'd even have to feign mental health issues if I had to sit outside in this shit all day.  I would genuinely go werewolf insane.
NewOrleans,3duf3t,NyctophobicParanoid,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:14:23 2015 UTC,"Makes sense. I know a decent amount of the usual population up here saves up for a bus ticket somewhere south and leaves once we hit the first few sub-zero days, so I wonder if people from down your way do the same in reverse."
NewOrleans,3dwono,m0ondogy,3,Mon Jul 20 03:58:02 2015 UTC,You're neighbors(ish) with my parents. I bet they're shitting bricks right now.

NewOrleans,3dwono,digitalaudioshop,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:38:13 2015 UTC,Absolutely not. I really am quite lazy.
NewOrleans,3dwono,ithinkimasofa,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:46:32 2015 UTC,Fuck' em.  I don't mean that.
NewOrleans,3dwono,digitalaudioshop,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:48:56 2015 UTC,"I assume I would have heard already if they were dead, so... I'm sure it's fine."
NewOrleans,3dwono,ithinkimasofa,2,Tue Jul 21 22:05:39 2015 UTC,I'm closer to that area and they still sounded further towards I 10 assuming it was gunshots and not fireworks
NewOrleans,3dwono,turby14,2,Mon Jul 20 04:21:40 2015 UTC,Reporting near wit's inn - sounded spaced apart like shots not fireworks
NewOrleans,3dwono,celtonceltcrimes,4,Mon Jul 20 20:01:07 2015 UTC,You expect people to see things and talk about what they saw? You must be new to the streets.
NewOrleans,3dwono,MayemMonkey,1 point,Mon Jul 20 07:43:50 2015 UTC,I heard it.
NewOrleans,3dwono,lamic,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:29:33 2015 UTC,I heard it too. I've been waiting for news on it.  My dog freaked out.
NewOrleans,3dwono,shihtzulove,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:18:52 2015 UTC,Is this the AK47 incident?
NewOrleans,3dwono,Cajun_Sensation_,2,Mon Jul 20 18:45:47 2015 UTC,"No, that happened this afternoon.  This was last night."
NewOrleans,3dwono,sharedinsanity,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:53:59 2015 UTC,Heard via person who was outside around then that it was just fireworks
NewOrleans,3dwono,acalmerkarma,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:14:43 2015 UTC,I heard something around that time but it sounded like fireworks to me. I'm near Finn McCool's.
