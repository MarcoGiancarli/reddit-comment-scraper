Blink182,3e4cy3,ShawnisMaximus,18,Tue Jul 21 22:16:20 2015 UTC,I think the Vegas stuff with Travis gives him enough days off for it to be doable. He's pretty good at coming in and nailing the drum parts.

And while this isn't exactly Tom's guitar, it looks similar and has a nice, punky sound.  Since I'm a cheapskate I bought a $90 Alston Stratocaster kit off of Amazon, as well as the materials to paint it Daphne Blue. I also ordered a knock off TD Pickguard off of EBay. The total ended up being around $250 I think. Again, I know it isn't exactly Tom's guitar; it's got a trem bridge, different wood, and not a legit Seymour-Duncan invader, it was a fun project.

It sucks. It's pretty apparent that they don't always get along and that their music tastes all differ drastically now. I believe Tom even said punk was just a phase for him.

Blink182,3dv3wb,Metalcentraldialog,4,Mon Jul 20 01:59:40 2015 UTC,Well if they could still be friends or amicable terms at least I'd take a last great album for them to be remembered by. If they were to make the album and then hate eachother I'd take the touring.
Blink182,3dv3wb,trainsaw,2,Sun Jul 19 23:36:00 2015 UTC,I'd prefer them to be on good terms and just go their separate ways. Mark does some guest vocals on an AVA track. Maybe Mark starts a band and Tom does guest vocals or Tom does guest vocals/guitar on a track Mark is producing. Mark and Tom both guest on a track from Travis's next solo album. And maybe we get a small blink tour every other year.
Blink182,3dv3wb,Metalcentraldialog,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:15:48 2015 UTC,Why not neither and they continue to make great music and love what they do.
Blink182,3dv3wb,trainsaw,0,Sun Jul 19 23:21:25 2015 UTC,"No new album, just touring."
Blink182,3dv3wb,Metalcentraldialog,6,Mon Jul 20 22:25:37 2015 UTC,"He's trying..  Poor Tom. Again, he obviously does love blink, and from the looks, it feels it was a fucking misunderstanding like in 2005."
Blink182,3dv3wb,i_shit_my_spacepants,-1,Sun Jul 19 21:37:41 2015 UTC,I don't know how a year of delays and backing out of commitments could be a 'misunderstanding'
Blink182,3dv3wb,rUafraid,3,Sun Jul 19 23:26:09 2015 UTC,"One word: Workaholic.  It isn't that fucking simple with Tom. If anybody that complains pay attention, Tom is a fucking workaholic  Ohyeah, downvote me. Cool."
Blink182,3dv3wb,Metalcentraldialog,-3,Mon Jul 20 02:32:38 2015 UTC,"No one disputed that fact, the part people question is how he wants to play victim in this whole thing when he was given ample opportunity to prioritize blink, he didn't and lead them on constantly. Misunderstanding or not, that final time, he had already laid a solid foundation of mistrust to where they told him they were moving on without him."
Blink182,3dv3wb,andrewhl2,5,Mon Jul 20 02:59:18 2015 UTC,"I still believe it's a misunderstand, and I'm pretty sure him stating how he was working on various projects (which has been shown as seen on his FB page) was probably taking his time. Remember, It took the director of LOVE and Tom a total or probably Five fucking years just to make the movie because it went from I-Empire to LOVE.   While I do think Tom is at fault, acting like he's the only one at fault isn't going to help the cause.  And I know some here hate Tom like he's satan and make this subreddit into a damn anti Tom circlejerk but fuck it, I'm standing my ground."
Blink182,3dv3wb,nmycon,0,Mon Jul 20 04:37:06 2015 UTC,"Tom is a fucking workaholic  he was working on various projects  Five fucking years just to make the movie   These are the habits of someone who doesn't know how to manage their time, not a workaholic.  Working on too many things at once will make all of them suffer, and this is pretty evident with everything Tom does. He puts out a bunch of unrelated, mediocre things and seems to hope that his name will make them sell despite their quality.  If he would put all of his effort into one thing the way he used to do with Blink, he could make something great again. The spray-and-pray of media releases is just disappointing."

Blink182,3dv3wb,wildcard6270,2,Mon Jul 20 16:13:34 2015 UTC,Nope :P
Blink182,3dv3wb,OkieME,3,Mon Jul 20 17:26:28 2015 UTC,"Well kudos on posting proof, I honestly thought that it was bullshit."
Blink182,3dv3wb,baggyizzle,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:47:01 2015 UTC,This is not proof of anything...  It's either tell the truth and gets booed or give an ambiguous answer like this one. Nothing more than a deflection.
Blink182,3dv3wb,Iokuas,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:10:41 2015 UTC,"I was referring to proof regarding him saying this, since there was another thread saying he said it."
Blink182,3dv3wb,yourexzacklyright,3,Mon Jul 20 05:30:53 2015 UTC,"I love that even when he's at an event for unrelated shit he can't escape it, that's good, cause his unrelated shit wouldn't even have its own event if it wasn't for blink 182, hope it just nails the point home that it's the only thing fans really care about at the end of the day. The other stuff we could take or leave."
Blink182,3dv3wb,Tma94,2,Mon Jul 20 01:35:35 2015 UTC,"I like AVA, but I could live without it."
Blink182,3dv3wb,Step1Mark,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:57:10 2015 UTC,This will probably get buried but what other alternative did he have besides deflecting this question like that. I don't see this as a true statement and was purely said to keep the crowd happy.
Blink182,3dv3wb,Tma94,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:03:09 2015 UTC,Video PROOF Tom telling a bald faced lie.
Blink182,3dv3wb,Step1Mark,1 point,Mon Jul 20 07:28:12 2015 UTC,He sounds very sarcastic to me.
Blink182,3dv3wb,Danny_Disco,7,Mon Jul 20 03:34:36 2015 UTC,She just gave us a brilliant idea.. Why don't we do a kickstarter?
Blink182,3dv3wb,Step1Mark,-1,Sun Jul 19 21:38:47 2015 UTC,To fund what ... an inception?
Blink182,3dv3wb,Danny_Disco,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:42:01 2015 UTC,To show them how you can't just replace the guy who created the band lol
