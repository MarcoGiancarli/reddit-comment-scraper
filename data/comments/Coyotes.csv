Coyotes,3e5kzy,McNugget14,2,Wed Jul 22 03:15:41 2015 UTC,Strome will be either with the big club or juniors because he isn't 20 yet. Most likely juniors.  The brothers Samuelsson will be down there.  Depending on space Lessio much pay there a bit.  A first year AHL guy who should be exciting for sure is Laurent Dauphin.  I'm not sure if Perlini is eligible for AHL  yet or not but he is fast and has an amazing shot.  Welcome to the Yotes/Falcons. Glad to have you!
Coyotes,3e5kzy,LoneWolfComando,2,Wed Jul 22 03:39:20 2015 UTC,"It is not possible for Strome to play in the AHL. He can only play in the NHL or the CHL. In terms of prospects though that will be down there look for Samuelsson and Lessio. I would say Domi and Duclair also, but they are almost shoe-ins to make the NHL team."
Coyotes,3e5o8u,Ramza_Claus,3,Wed Jul 22 03:44:01 2015 UTC,Bc a lot of people are un familiar to hockey and do not follow the team and all they here is bad news from the local news due to the COG woes.
Coyotes,3e5o8u,DobbyD43,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:54:17 2015 UTC,"Pretty much what /u/DobbyD43 said, also where I'm from (Tucson) Hockey is treated as a joke and no one respects the Ice Cats either. It really sucks to be a hockey fan down here."
Coyotes,3e12eu,VaporKraze,2,Tue Jul 21 03:28:21 2015 UTC,How often do they broadcast.

Coyotes,3dzn8i,DobbyD43,4,Mon Jul 20 20:45:06 2015 UTC,Thanks! I was looking for something to do. It also looks like Game 5 will be on after this one.  Edit: I derped out and forgot that the series didn't go to game 5.
Coyotes,3dz0n0,LoneWolfComando,4,Mon Jul 20 18:04:55 2015 UTC,Santa Klas only signed a one-year contract? :-( Our coaching staff seemed to have a lot of confidence in him.
Coyotes,3dz0n0,KYOEL,4,Mon Jul 20 18:46:54 2015 UTC,My guess is he wants to go out and earn a one way deal.
Coyotes,3dz0n0,Bert314159,3,Mon Jul 20 19:16:38 2015 UTC,Yup. He's 24 now. He's gunning for a full-time NHL spot.
Coyotes,3dz0n0,PhxRangers,4,Mon Jul 20 23:04:38 2015 UTC,There's going to be lots of work to be done next season with all these 1 year contracts being signed.

Coyotes,3doall,VaporKraze,4,Fri Jul 17 22:12:00 2015 UTC,"Executive session is used when there are outstanding legal issues that warrant council attention,  but are not public discussion. It could be related to people hurt on city property, employee issues,  traffic incidents,  police actions,  or the Coyotes. Let's be serious though,  it's about the Coyotes."
Coyotes,3doall,ViceroyFizzlebottom,4,Sat Jul 18 18:14:26 2015 UTC,"I know we all want the blood of the City Council but the Ice Arizona really doesn't want to put their case (no matter how strong) in the hands of the Arizona Supreme Court.  At best they'll get special performance and just keep the contract while Glendale finds another way to weasel out, at worst the Yotes lose and probably leave the state.  If IceArizona and CoG find a deal that doesn't disrupt the teams financial stability and keeps them around then that's fine."
Coyotes,3doall,97EchoEcho,3,Fri Jul 17 23:38:06 2015 UTC,For fucks sake.
Coyotes,3doall,LoneWolfComando,2,Fri Jul 17 22:36:07 2015 UTC,Yeah I know. :/
Coyotes,3doall,DobbyD43,2,Fri Jul 17 22:38:08 2015 UTC,What does this mean??
Coyotes,3doall,DobbyD43,2,Fri Jul 17 23:10:12 2015 UTC,"You might need to have someone else help explain, but I think this means that Glendale scheduled a meeting for next Monday, and in that meaning they will talk about what they are going to do with the Coyotes deal. This might mean a couple different things, and one of those could be that the CoG and Ice AZ have come to maybe come to an agreement on a new contract."
Coyotes,3doall,glid3r,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:41:48 2015 UTC,Thanks. I just don't get why their pissed
Coyotes,3dof4n,Bert314159,10,Fri Jul 17 22:49:53 2015 UTC,"I can't help myself.  It must be a sickness but I am always optimistic about a season before the first puck drop.  I set myself up for disappointment a lot that way but the Coyotes have taught me to get over that quickly (lots of practice haha).  I've see your posts and they always look well informed to me, so I think you have a pretty good guess at our offense.  I guess I'll just root for a better defense and a return of crazy good Mike Smith (shhh - don't laugh at me)."
Coyotes,3dof4n,Gremlich,2,Sat Jul 18 00:57:33 2015 UTC,"Me too, and I'm doing it to myself again this season."
Coyotes,3dof4n,deucemcsizzles,7,Sat Jul 18 15:14:06 2015 UTC,"I have to think that both Domi and Duclair will be in contention for the Rocket Richard. 50+ each. Book it.   179 is not exactly great though, is it? I suppose we should be pretty happy if they both hit 10+?"
Coyotes,3dof4n,em483,3,Fri Jul 17 23:58:10 2015 UTC,"Generally speaking, 200 goals in bottom 5 in the NHL, if not worse. Scoring was down last year so the number was skewed a bit. Usually only 1 or 2 teams score under 200, last year 5 did.  I think we should be happy if one of them gets 10+."
Coyotes,3dof4n,zuul99,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:15:40 2015 UTC,I am thinking they will go after Selanne's rookie record of 76 goals
Coyotes,3dof4n,LoneWolfComando,5,Sat Jul 18 07:14:56 2015 UTC,"Here is the quick analysis I whipped up, which could potentially make us top 10 in the league. Although with injuries and what not I'd probably drop off 15 or so, so lets call it; 232 which is right about average."
Coyotes,3dof4n,LoneWolfComando,6,Sat Jul 18 01:41:40 2015 UTC,Damn I should have added 1 for Smith.  I think that's more likely than Stone getting 10.
Coyotes,3dof4n,VaporKraze,3,Sat Jul 18 02:01:38 2015 UTC,I gave him 10 under hopes he will pay PP1. If he does I think it's possible.  Maybe should have went with 7?
Coyotes,3dof4n,LoneWolfComando,3,Sat Jul 18 02:10:27 2015 UTC,"If he uses his cannon of a shot more I think he could get to 10 as well. Now not every shot from the point has to be a slapshot, but if he used it more and we maybe set up a umbrella style PP with him at the point, I could see 10."
Coyotes,3dof4n,LoneWolfComando,2,Sat Jul 18 02:39:33 2015 UTC,"I'd guess 5. He got to 8 two years ago, and had a very low shooting percentage this year. I imagine he can average 5 per year. 10 goals is pretty elite for a defenseman."
Coyotes,3dof4n,agerry21,3,Sat Jul 18 03:14:05 2015 UTC,True but I feel like he has a pretty elite shot.  His passing just isn't anything special.
Coyotes,3dof4n,Buggymaster,4,Sat Jul 18 03:21:52 2015 UTC,"He does have a good shot. Let's see... he had 144 shots last year and only 2 goals. Those will start to go in. If he gets more powerplay time, then his shot production could go up too.  160 shots with a 5% shooting percentage is 8 goals. He could actually get to 10 with more PP time now that I really think about it."
Coyotes,3dof4n,agerry21,4,Sat Jul 18 03:56:16 2015 UTC,:D that's what I was thinking.
Coyotes,3dof4n,Buggymaster,4,Sat Jul 18 07:08:24 2015 UTC,I just noticed Brandon McMillan is on that list. Boy he dropped off.
Coyotes,3dof4n,shoegoo,2,Fri Jul 17 23:19:14 2015 UTC,McMillion$$$  Yeah he really wasn't great. Seemed to at least skate hard during his time here though.
Coyotes,3dof4n,spoopy_fondue,3,Sun Jul 19 06:37:17 2015 UTC,I honestly find it hard to believe that John Scott will only get one goal. I believe that he'll stumble into at least three.
Coyotes,3dof4n,VaporKraze,3,Sun Jul 19 03:01:33 2015 UTC,He has 5 career goals with 1955 minutes played. He'll be lucky to get one.

I‚Äôll have you know John Scott is the top grinder in the NHL, with over 1500 fights won, and a hattrick across the course of last season.

You are nothing to him but just another greaseball. He will wipe you the fuck out with brutality the likes of which has never been seen before in the NHL, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to him over the Internet? Think again, hoser. As we speak I am contacting John Scott himself to inform him of your ""clever"" chirp, and within moments he will have a team of cult members outside your basement, awaiting his arrival so that they can watch him end your pathetic little life.

Coyotes,3dlmtv,Spuddyy,7,Fri Jul 17 17:05:58 2015 UTC,I want Domi in the 60 point marine 20-25 goals and 35-40 assists. Optimistic but if he plays with Hanzal possible.
Coyotes,3dlmtv,LoneWolfComando,7,Fri Jul 17 18:45:21 2015 UTC,I want Domi in the 100 point marine but I tried to hold back my expectations maybe to the point of being pessimistic
Coyotes,3dlmtv,Spuddyy,5,Fri Jul 17 19:06:02 2015 UTC,I get that. I'm just hopeful that since we gave him 2 extra years to develop that he'll really come in and blow us away. If not there is always AHL time :/

Doan gets to lift it, then Yandle becomes our new Captain after signing a long term deal in the off season.   Domi wins the Calder trophy with an 83 point season, he loses out on the Art Ross trophy by about 20 points. Vermette wins the Conn Smythe Trophy. Doan wins the King Clancy trophy and retires. He joins the organization as a staff member. Despite an incredible season OEL is snubbed and not considered for the Norris trophy.

Coyotes,3diupt,LoneWolfComando,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:33:28 2015 UTC,"Good decision, Tippett wouldn't play him anyways."
Coyotes,3diy9g,LoneWolfComando,3,Thu Jul 16 17:24:17 2015 UTC,Did anyone else start sweating when reading the part about possibly hiring Mike Smith's personal coach as the team goalie coach?
Coyotes,3diy9g,shoegoo,2,Thu Jul 16 22:39:06 2015 UTC,A little bit.  He obviously hasn't been the best lately
Coyotes,3diy9g,spoopy_fondue,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:42:01 2015 UTC,He also isn't a coach Smitty works with year round. He helped him at Worlds so maybe he wouldn't be a bad sign
Coyotes,3diy9g,VaporKraze,2,Fri Jul 17 17:23:41 2015 UTC,Of those players still available I wouldn't mind signing Fehr out of all them if we could get him for the right price. He could play C or wing and is good for at least 25 points if not north of 30.
Coyotes,3diy9g,DobbyD43,2,Thu Jul 16 17:54:50 2015 UTC,Of players available up front I think I'd want Glencross or Stempniak
Coyotes,3diy9g,VaporKraze,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:57:34 2015 UTC,bodeker-vermy-fehr?
Coyotes,3dgrv1,diceone,11,Thu Jul 16 03:42:58 2015 UTC,"That's awesome. I hate when people say we don't have fans, because even my dog used to enjoy watching Coyotes games with me, and when I was a little kid he would play goalie in knee hockey.  It is such a stupid joke at this point to say a team doesn't have fans. Whether they are being serious or not, it is just stupid to say to begin with. By the logic of some people that says we have no fans....  13-14k a game = No fans, move team.  17k a game = A lot of fans and great fan support."
Coyotes,3dgrv1,VaporKraze,7,Thu Jul 16 03:55:03 2015 UTC,Someone should send this to the Coyotes twitter account.
Coyotes,3dgrv1,mynameisnutt,5,Thu Jul 16 07:03:52 2015 UTC,"My son is the same way.  Always wants to wear his Coyotes Jammies and Cyotes shirts and Coyotes jersey, wants to go outside and play with his hockey set.  He has been going to games since before he was born.  The last two seasons we have taken him to every Saturday game and he LOVES it.  He is howling, telling them to ""go go go go"" and ""shoot puck"".  So adorable - hope they stick around for him and other kids like him."
Coyotes,3dgrv1,Gremlich,5,Thu Jul 16 14:35:03 2015 UTC,Aww! That howl the little dude let out was adorable.
Coyotes,3dgrv1,cardinals1996,3,Thu Jul 16 04:48:32 2015 UTC,"haha, this is cute... I have a 6 months old one who already have all things Coyotes ready for him :P I guess he'll not really have the choice :D"
Coyotes,3dgrv1,thepetrochemist,2,Thu Jul 16 08:59:41 2015 UTC,haha very cute. He will be a fan for years to come.
Coyotes,3dgrv1,DobbyD43,2,Thu Jul 16 03:59:17 2015 UTC,This was the cutest.   Can he play goalie?
Coyotes,3dgrv1,em483,2,Thu Jul 16 14:41:00 2015 UTC,"He's working on his lateral splits, but he likes to jump in front of the ball when I try shooting it in.   We're thinking that might be his future position :-)"
Coyotes,3dh42l,singletracker,3,Thu Jul 16 05:48:25 2015 UTC,More back to backs though. :/  Little victories I guess.
Coyotes,3dh42l,roboyote,2,Thu Jul 16 06:02:36 2015 UTC,Yeah but that means more kids ice time!
Coyotes,3dfnhn,Rhyanbass,2,Wed Jul 15 22:09:25 2015 UTC,"That is interesting. The way Leblanc was talking about the situation during the Scottsdale town hall gave me the impression that both sides were working towards a solution, so this makes sense to me. I wonder how it will play out."
Coyotes,3dcews,DobbyD43,6,Wed Jul 15 04:25:33 2015 UTC,Plays the wing and would take a spot away from a younger prospect.
Coyotes,3dcews,Spuddyy,5,Wed Jul 15 04:34:58 2015 UTC,"Nope. Tip would never go for that. Our RW line up has Doan, Downie, Vitale, plus Rieder, Duclair, and Boedker could also slide over to that side I don't see it happening."
Coyotes,3dcews,Bert314159,2,Wed Jul 15 04:47:38 2015 UTC,But we need  a top guy. I really miss verb ;(
Coyotes,3dcews,VaporKraze,7,Wed Jul 15 04:49:59 2015 UTC,He isn't a top guy anymore. Plus he is a defensive liability and is lazy.
Coyotes,3dcews,Bert314159,5,Wed Jul 15 04:52:05 2015 UTC,"The only way we're getting a top guy is through our prospect pool and future drafts. Fortunately, we're loaded in the prospect pool and will likely be picking high again next year. The only FA I'd like to see us go for at this point is Cody Franson."
Coyotes,3dcews,retrofade,4,Wed Jul 15 04:54:42 2015 UTC,"No. No. No. No. Fuck no. No. No. No. No.   http://imgur.com/UY5GMqF  I live in Raleigh and have watched him play for the Canes the last two seasons. He's lazy all around lazy, sucks on offense now, and puts forth a barely lackadaisical effort on defense. He'd be a ridiculously awful fit for this team."
Coyotes,3dcews,JeffF1,3,Wed Jul 15 20:39:07 2015 UTC,Nope. Nope. Nope. Nope.  No way.  Nope.
Coyotes,3dcews,RockingtheRed,2,Wed Jul 15 07:39:59 2015 UTC,"Good idea.  Let's take a veteran with literally 0 work ethic, and a reputation for having a crappy attitude, and put him in the locker room with all of the Yotes' impressionable youngsters. That'll end well..."
Coyotes,3dcews,ProJoe,2,Wed Jul 15 13:09:56 2015 UTC,here comes another multi million buyout!  fuck you Ribero.
Coyotes,3dcews,zuul99,2,Wed Jul 15 20:12:55 2015 UTC,I consider him a high risk player. He has the potential to be good but he is more likely to suck wind.
Coyotes,3dcews,LoneWolfComando,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:07:35 2015 UTC,NOPE.
Coyotes,3dbg4t,Bert314159,3,Tue Jul 14 23:45:16 2015 UTC,Phillip?
Coyotes,3dbg4t,PaulRuffin,3,Wed Jul 15 00:49:10 2015 UTC,Yes.
Coyotes,3dbg4t,LoneWolfComando,2,Wed Jul 15 00:50:13 2015 UTC,That's a pay cut for Philip isn't it?
Coyotes,3dbg4t,SpacedCoyote,2,Wed Jul 15 03:41:23 2015 UTC,"Pretty much the same as far as NHL salary, 600k. He was making 900k including bonuses though with his last contract, not sure if that's changed. But seeing how he is basically our #8 Dman, behind Dahlbeck and Gromley, we're probably only going to pay him around 65k to play in the minors."
Coyotes,3dbg4t,TweetPoster,0,Wed Jul 15 14:22:12 2015 UTC,"@TimWharnsby:   2015-07-14 22:27:53 UTC  #Coyotes settle with Samuelsson + Shinnimin Samuelson 2015-16: $600,000 (NHL) Shinnimin 2015-16: $600,000 (NHL)     [Mistake?] [Suggestion] [FAQ] [Code] [Issues]"
Coyotes,3dbdqw,VaporKraze,7,Tue Jul 14 23:26:13 2015 UTC,While I'm excited to see them on the ice and playing for AZ ... This interview seemed really forced.
Coyotes,3dbdqw,Spuddyy,4,Wed Jul 15 01:17:12 2015 UTC,"Agreed. A tad cringeworthy here and there. That being said, I was glad to hear they're close from u18 and that they had joked about being on the same team. I'm super excited to see them step up in the nhl and to see how they do. Should be interesting. Speaking of young guys, does anyone know the situation with lessio? I thought he played pretty well when they recalled him last season."
Coyotes,3dbdqw,weaselninja,5,Wed Jul 15 01:48:07 2015 UTC,"""We both like hockey""  Wow, I never would have guessed"
Coyotes,3dbdqw,lululandia,6,Wed Jul 15 04:47:01 2015 UTC,so awkward...I personally would have liked to see them interview each other. I don't dislike Lindsey but I don't like how she does interviews. They all seem so forced...
