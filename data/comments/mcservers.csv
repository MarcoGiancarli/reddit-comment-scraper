The website suggests the most people who have ever been online at the same time is 4, is that just because the user-base is still growing? The /warp command is handy but seems over-powered, is that supposed to be available to all users? :P  Is there a plugin for protecting builds (i.e. claiming blocks like in GriefPrevention) or is it a trust system?

mcservers,3du2pk,Zyrak303,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:15:40 2015 UTC,"Yes, our current world is medieval/fantasy themed, but the new one won't be. There will be no limitations in building styles/themes. A great advantage compared to many other servers is that you will be entering it when the new map starts. This means that you will be involved in (if you like) planning things like spawn, nether hub etc. In my opinion, joining a server where everything already is set up for you, isn't as fun. The fact that the map will be new, also makes a great opportunity to get to know the community.  Other than that, we're a small and nice community with experienced players. If you have any specific questions, feel free to ask!"

mcservers,3du2pk,SuperHappyMC,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:21:20 2015 UTC,"Hi, we are really well protected and our ranks don't enable any cheats... Maybe I don't really understand what you mean by it? We're not vanilla (although we do have a more vanilla test server) so higher ranks do get more permissions, but the plugins are really well balanced so there is nothing really OP. But anyway I am not really sure what you meant by the cheats, however, I can assure you we don't sell anything for real $. I don't know where you got that from but I very much know it's against the rules and I don't do it. People donate if they want and get a sunflower for it, and a couple cosmetic things like access to the /nick command and ability to make fireworks. We also have some good, dedicated developers that take care of security stuff, so I hope this info at least helps clarify some things. You are welcome to join us and see if you like it and ask any other questions, the community is really friendly. There is no abuse of power, no drama, and again, it is not pay to win at all!!"

mcservers,3du2pk,LittleMissOlive,1 point,Mon Jul 20 09:24:41 2015 UTC,"No, you're fine to point that out!! It's just NOT REAL MONEY :). That's forum points... it's a donation shop where you can donate real life money (and get a sunflower and the cosmetic changes, like I said), OR purchase all kinds of things with points you earn by just using the website and the forums. It's not pay to win, trust me, I made it like that from the beginning. This REALLY is the kind of server I set up to have fun, not make money. I do not recruit for $ at all, I don't remind people to donate, I don't sell items or ranks. People have tried to offer me $ for ranks or items and I've always said no. I don't even do drop parties on the server. It's all legit, friendly, and not for profit!"
mcservers,3du2pk,alwaysonmylastbowl,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:43:08 2015 UTC,so you say its kinda a reward program for regular player's? well i think that's fine but idk for sure so u should ask mojang if its allowed before they pull your server down. anyway i decided wich server i wanted to play on already so its kinda too late to change now or does your server has always player's online and no need to make a acount for new ranks or delete my progress after a month of inactivity (or longer idk if i need to study hard for the stuff i want to learn next so)  anyway i will give you another chanse only thing you need to do is answering my questions in this message and i might change my mind  Ps. If you answer then it wil take a while before I answer because I'm going on vacation so I probably answer the end of this week

Some of the more important things I can offer you are:   We will have regular meetings with the server members, ensuring that everyone enjoys the server and all builds that might ruin the visual appearance of your stream can be talked about and their problems resolved. During this process we expect to create a solid community, which ties in perfectly with your desire to play in a community, some of which might be very willing to stream with you. Our server is 100% vanilla, no outside plugins and things like head dropping, 1 man sleeping or world borders get discussed by the group. This way you'll never feel like your wishes are being ignored.   I do have to mention that we are not accepting just anyone. So if you are interested, I would like to have a little chat on skype to see if you are a good fit for us.  Thank you for reading, and hopefully till soon!"

It's a skill building plugin that gives some pretty interesting perks if you build up skills enough. We also don't allow griefing, anything that is messed with is instantly rolledback to its non-griefed state, and the player who griefed is banned. We have a pretty strict no cheating rule in place as well to keep things fair.  Anywho, if this sounds interesting, I can't wait to meet you in game.

It's quite a large map with plenty of space to build and so many towns you could choose to be a part of with breathtaking builds around every corner. I highly encourage you to join Freebuilders.
mcservers,3dekoh,Majyyks,3,Wed Jul 15 20:11:35 2015 UTC,"I've been a part of a lot of online communities and normally when you join one it's a pain to talk and interact at first because most places come with cliques and people normally stick to them. Freebuilders is different. I was welcomed in instantly. The groups all co-mingle and help each other out.   It's a really refreshing experience. You never feel unwanted! There's always things to do, projects you can assist with. Or you can build up your own projects and show them off (Or live far far away like a crazy hermit like I do). The community really enjoys visiting each other and checking out other builds. There's also random in-game events like parkour for example (which I'm hilariously bad at).   Every server says they're friendly and active to lure people in. But Freebuilders is genuine and the people I've met on here are irreplaceable. It's a really rare thing to find a group of people of this caliber all in one place. Who knows how many friends you have in Freebuilders that you haven't even met yet?  <3 Freebuilders"

mcservers,3df14d,greener_ca,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:30:09 2015 UTC,"Crap, I'll have to look into that.  So overviewer:  It parses the mca files and collects all tile entities/entities when it does a POI update, it also gives you an API to filter any of these to display on the map. I just wrote a bunch that look at the text on signs and displays an icon depending on what the first line is.  Mailboxes: related to overviewer, filters can also contain pretty much anything you can do with Python, so I just look for chests named after a player that may or may not have stuff in them and store that for notification in game, web and eventually Slack.  Snapshotting: that's just ZFS. I suggest you read about zfs, it's like LVM but better. Snapshots only save the changes between states so a 20 minute snapshot only stores about 10MB instead of the entire world data (about 7GB) right now.  PM me if you want to know more details. Code is not ready to be released."

mcservers,3dfens,AudaciTEA,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:04:43 2015 UTC,"Name: Kate  Age: 17  Country: USA (Northeast, NJ)  Email: N/A for now until it's needed, if that's alright.  Skype: N/A for now also.  Minecraft Username: Shimmerine  Why do you want to be whitelisted on our server? I'm looking for a vanilla server with a good community that understands that sometimes its nice to be off on your own, building peacefully, and when community needs to come together. I figure YouTubers, whether the entire server is or isn't, would understand that the most. It's kind of their job to speak and choose content and timing, if that makes sense.  In a paragraph, please describe yourself: I like to build things in a different style on every server/biome I visit. I don't like building the same thing over and over again and I'll even get annoyed if I find myself slipping into building habits. I like pushing my creativity. I like when things aren't too extravagant and over the top, unless they're done right. (I was just on a server with a spawn that brought my comfortable 50fps down to 5fps. No fun.)  How long have you played Minecraft?: Since 2012, I think. It's been an on and off obsession once school comes back into play.  Do you have a Youtube Account? If YES, please give us the URL: No, I'm sorry, but I don't.   Will you be participating in Events?: Yes. Looove events. It keeps any community alive.  Will you be helping with Community Projects?: Of course.   How active will you be on our server? (Hours per Week): ~20 hours a week? Depending on work, I can be on 3-4 hours a day.  Do you understand that Teamspeak is Mandatory?: Yes, but do I need to be online at all times? I have Teamspeak and a microphone, but sometimes I'm more in the mood to just build quietly to my music rather than talk.  If Accepted, what time would you like your Teamspeak Interview? 7:00 PM EST would be great.  Do you agree to our rules? (You MUST Join The Website): Yes. I'm joining the website as I type this, just to speed along the process."

mcservers,3deqj5,raybob_11,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:47:33 2015 UTC,"IGN: KarlWhale. Skype: C_whale77. Age: 22. Country: Lithuania. I consider myself a builder and I usualy try to create a city or a village of some sort. Building encompasses redstone contractions aswell. But I do believe I'm best at building relationships. Minecraft caught my eyes because of endless posibilities of playtime as well as great communities you can meet. If the server were to become inactive I feel it's important to keep on trying on building the right community. There should be a regular rotation of members. Like when the timber burns out you throw in new ones. I also believe server should improve accordingly, maybe collect surveys of members. Also donation fund should be established because it's expensive and difficult to run a server. I dont have many hobbies but I like geocatching and overall travelling to various cities in Europe and beyond. I like programming (not really). I am very keen on following and analyzing politics thought thats more my field than a hobby. I will follow the rules. Hope I'll be accepted.

We've got a very strong core community who invest in everything from small personal homes to the largest, grandest of facilities.  Our founding principals are simple:   Create a server that mimics the vanilla game as closely as possible while allowing a large, vibrant community to fill the map. For our map to continually expand rather than reset. To be professionally maintained. To retain a relatively mature community. Our average age is 21, although we have people of all ages.    We achieve this by only using plugins that affect administrative aspects of the server. It is extremely important to me that there are no artificial changes to the way the vanilla game behaves.   We believe you would be an ideal fit because you seem to have a strong interest in working with a community and to thrive on a stable server that will be around for years to come.

Age/Country: 23, United States  MKE: Been playing since the game was in alpha. I know combat and mining and building, but am wholly lacking in the redstone department. I can set-up mob farms, and even set-up some fairly remarkable automatic farms in the day for potatoes so that I could get food and a steady drip of XP. Probably my most laborious task was chopping down an island in an ocean biome until it was level with the seabed, layering the seabed with gravel and sand to make it look natural, and then ensuring that the water levels above stayed constant, all so that my base (which I had built far too close to spawn) would stay intact on a hardcore server. I have flashbacks to that task mates… man. Lol My experience can basically be summed up to a jack of all trades, with a heaping helping of patience.  Why us?: I always find myself alone in a server, politely asking the wind if it needs any help and not getting a response. I tire of that. You guys seem to run a very tight, close community where my desire to help can be met with a need. I like helping, and I focus often on helping others more so than my own builds. Whatever I selfishly build in my own corner is one thing, but working tirelessly so that players can enjoy a mob grinder for example, yields a much better experience. You guys seem to offer me just what I want, and I’m willing to give back just what you need in return: Community.  Previous Servers: I usually stay on a server for a year until for whatever reason it declines and everyone leaves. I’ve built jungle homes, savannah homes, undersea fortresses, dwarven citadels, and all manner of things only to seem them disappear as the server’s fateful ping is silence forever, but that’s fine, because the labor, the joy, and the camaraderie I experience still lingers even after the IP no longer returns my call. I’m loyal, and I’m damned certain that on those servers I was the last lummox slugging away in a marsh trying to find slimes by moonlight, helping out every newcomer best as I could.

Srimes  Skype? srimesmc  Age and Country? 19, Living in the states, VA to be exact  Minecraft Expertise: I have been playing Minecraft since before you got a hunger bar. I think like 1.7.3 beta or so. I understand Minecraft to a level where its sorta embarrassing. I'm can build XP farms, understand redstone, can build shops. I can set up redstone contraptions, and I like to build towns. I've seen lots of Zipkrowd stuff I understand it. I've played videogames since I was very young, and I like to master games, like minecraft, Super smash brothers Melee, and so on.  Why? I like playing Minecraft with people. I rarely play single player after I joined my first server. SMP is just a lot more fun. I used to play on a good server, but bad stuff happened (I'll explain next paragraph) and after all I could find were bad ones. I think this server might have the SMP fun I've been longing for.  Past SMP: I used to run a SMP with my brother, and we put it up /r/mcservers, It was called AporCraft, due to my brothers IGN, Aporatzi (We had a subreddit, /r/aporcraft). We had about 15 people on, and It was great. One day, a new player got accepted, and he griefed every thing. Our last server save was a week back, so lots of peoples stuff or achivements were stripped from them. Everybody sorta got burnt out, and stopped playing. Since then, I played on a friends server for a while. Not the same at all. There was next to no spawn town, and I was the only one who had a shop. It felt like single player with a chat room. I know the in's and out's and what to do and not to do on a sever, so you don't have to explain stuff like nether hub, or community events.  Imgur stuff: I don't have much to offer, since all my good builds were on servers, but I have this snapshot of a shop I built that sold baked potatoes http://imgur.com/kpZtciI"

A description can be found on our /r/mcservers post at http://bit.ly/1JdN5he  We've been around for a while so our survival server is well developed, but we've always been a small community so it's never crowded.  Semi-vanilla with an economy system and anti-grief plugins, but otherwise normal survival.  We are not whitelisted, but we have many active staff members to maintain the chatroom.  Survival is almost entirely PVE, but we do have a world where PVP is allowed.  We also have 1vs1 PVP arenas and Mob Arenas.  Take care!  (edit:  Just to add that we are 1.8.7, but since we have been around for a while, most of the terrain maps were generated when we were 1.7.10.  However we also don't have worldborders on our survival worlds, so you can move into an ungenerated area and the chunks should generate as 1.8.)"

About me:  I used to play on a server called dreamcraft. It was a great server. It was also whitelist only, and the player quality was high. It was the kind of server where you could build something without protection, leave it for a week, and it wouldn't be damaged when you came back. They shut down almost exactly a year ago though. I've almost exclusively played single player since then.   I'm over 18  I've played Minecraft since June 10, 2011. I played the ""classic"" demo a while before that though.  Survival is my favorite game mode. Creative never felt as rewarding. It's much more satisfying building something cool with resources you put a lot of effort into getting. I'm not really into PVP at all.    One question. I saw that it said mob grinders are banned. I was wondering if automatic cactus farms are also banned for the same reasons. Auto cactus farms are one of my favorite things to build, and I wanted to ask before I made one. If they're banned I'll just not build any."

IP: 198.143.131.99  PMC Post: http://www.planetminecraft.com/server/kingdom-of-naelov    To the end of making survival enjoyable, we have a bunch of objectives that you can complete to rank up, such as building an automatic potion brewing machine, making a two-story log cabin, crafting the five banners found in spawn, or writing an original story in a book. You rank up when you complete certain numbers of these objectives, which gives you access to more and more spells to cast.  PvP is allowed in the Kingdom, but not encouraged. It's rare for someone to initiate PvP with anyone but a friend they're playing with.  We use the common GriefPrevention to allow people to protect areas, and can roll back any damage done to unclaimed areas with LogBlock.  Right now we have 5-8 active players on, which have formed two towns.

mcservers,3cdkyd,The_Holy_Bison,3,Tue Jul 7 02:09:13 2015 UTC,"IGN: LiteralBlocks  Age: I am age 18. I was born on September 30, 1996 sometime around 6 a.m.  Skype: Skype is a VoIP program that can easily be used for online communication. Skype was founded in 2003 and has remained a staple communication application for many years. You didn't specify, but if you are asking for my personal account it is ""eugene.park52"".  Timezone: CST  Do you have a youtube/twitch? Yes, my youtube channel was created 3 years ago and I have uploaded 11 videos. Some videos, for example, are titled ""Shake"", ""Every song of Nickelback's 'All The Right Reasons' at the same time"", and what I'm best known for: ""2 Hours of EPIC! Butt-Rock."" My youtube channel has 96,516 views and 80 subscribers. My youtube picture is of a cat with a bow tie on. My youtube channel does not have any ""channel art"" for a banner. My most viewed video has 68,078 views currently.  Have you ever been banned? If yes, why? No, I have not been banned. However, I do not believe that the number of times someone has been banned should be used as a benchmark of good-will. Anybody can be banned by an admin or moderator for no reason. It's impossible to assume that every admin or mod will accurately and maturely judge every situation. There also situations where friends will ban their friends as a joke; would that count as being banned? Because of the inconclusive standard you are setting by using bans as a testament of a player's worth, it is impossible to ensure you are actually accepting all the worthy players. What about the kid who got banned for calling his friend a name? Is he bad? Does he deserve to die? Why are you killing him?   What youtuber best represents you and why? What does this have to do with anything? I represent me, not some two bit hack on the internet. Do not compare me to any lesser human. I am who I am, nobody else. I'm sorry if I come off as aggressive, I am simply trying to emphasize my point: we are who we are, comparing ourselves to the stars in the sky is meaningless. We have to embrace who we are, not struggle to try and be someone else. Anyway, major youtubers are usually not even acting like themselves. When you gain a large audience you can't cater to everyone unless you change how you act. This leaves us with popular youtubers that are obviously operating on a formula to keep their fans happy and to gain more fans. Popularity changes people, this is especially relevant in pop culture. How many celebrities have we heard of that have crashed after getting popular? Almost in direct response to these tragedies, popular youtubers avoid this crash by completely changing themselves. Whether by becoming PG and family friendly, or going for very easy and immature humor, these youtubers pander to whoever is watching. Videos, like any other form of media art, should be an expression of the creator. These youtubers aren't even expressing themselves anymore. They are expressing what their audience perceives them as, surrendering any personality or quirks they have in exchange for sappy humor or smiles and rainbows. With all that said, PewDiePie.  What is your best skill in minecraft? In Minecraft I have always been good at mining. However, I am reluctant to tell you this for fear of ill intent. Are you going to force me to mine? Am I going to be a slave? Why would you need to know this? You don't just ask this of a person. I fear that by asking any applicants this question you are attempting to pigeon hold them into a certain role or position in the server. There's a little thing called the constitution, have you heard of it? Everyone has certain inalienable rights that you cannot infringe upon. What about the american dream? Westward expansion? Manifest Destiny? If a person joins the server as an appointed farmer, is it impossible for them to work their way up? Can they not be a miner? Can they not achieve the status of moderator? I thought this was America, not 1800's rural south. You can't reimpose slavery, stop trying.  How often do you play minecraft? Why do you need to know? Are you the NSA? No, the NSA would already have that information. You are clearly someone who wants to know a lot about me. Are you with the government? NATO? It doesn't matter, I'm not going to answer this question. I've read a lot recently about how the government is spying on everyone. The article titled ""Spy America and Its Willing Victims"" goes into detail on the NSA's operations. Having read this article and feeling learned on the topic, I respectfully decline to answer this question.  Why do you wish to join suncraft? Why does anybody wish to do anything? Our brains are just a network of electricity with which we derive meaning and desire. There are few things we ""have"" to do, meaning that without doing these thing we will simply wither and die. Of these select functions, such as breathing and eating, there is a lack of ""play minecraft."" So if it's not an innate need, why do we play minecraft? Is it simply a fun hobby to pass time? I think it's more cerebral. We willingly throw our time into this video game that, at least at the surface level, does nothing to help our own self. But just as we derive meaning from whatever we personally choose, we derive meaning from playing this video game. Perhaps I am seeking this meaning, thus wanting to play on ""Suncraft."" Maybe it's the need for companionship, or the need for social activity. Assuming most of the minecraft player base spends a vast amount of their personal time on the computer, it is easy to imagine a lack of social relationships. Minecraft servers provide a real and visceral social experience, allowing players to interact and socialize with other players.   Do you agree to the rules listed above? Yeah sure."

Yes to both, but so far I haven't really posted  Have you ever been banned? If yes, why? I've been whitelisted due to inactivity   What youtuber best represents you and why? Probably HeyImBee because we have similar personality traits.  We might not be the best at building or at pvp but we are actively trying to get better.  What is your best skill in minecraft? Probably finding things like fortresses, villages, spawners, etc.  How often do you play minecraft? As often as I can when I'm on a server I enjoy.  Usually at least 3/5 days a week.  Why do you wish to join sun craft? I recently joined a smp but it had really bad lag so I'm looking for a new community I can start on.  I've played smp servers before but got bored and ran out of things to do so I'd like a new start where I can work my way up again.  Do you agree to the rules listed above? Yes"

PewDiePie, because he likes having fun and helping others, also he is not afraid to be himself. What is your best skill in minecraft? Building and mining. How often do you play minecraft? almost every day. Why do you wish to join sun craft? I need a new SMP server after my old one closed and this seems like a nice server to join.

I guess Markiplier, because he seems to really care and empathize with people and wants everyone to have a good time.   What is your best skill in minecraft?  Mass-producing potions and consumables for trading.  How often do you play minecraft?  I come and go, playing often for weeks at a time and then vanishing for a while (but that's usually because of servers dying/being shut down)  Why do you wish to join suncraft?  I like playing on servers as long as other players are mature and cooperative.  Do you agree to the rules listed above?  Yes."

I actually ran a server for family and friends for most of this time, but almost no one plays anymore and I could not justify the monthly expense for an empty server. I am looking to get on to a survival server with a cooperative group of players. I do not necessarily want to build a community, but rather play in a supportive and respectful world. I have read your rules, understand them, and would like to try out your server if you have space available.  Your rules: Don't be a jerk, respect other players and their space, 500 block minimum build distance from ~other player-made structures~ spawn, no lag machines.  Thanks for considering me, hope to see you online!"

If applied/accepted to the server this is all detailed pretty thoroughly in the acceptance letter. One diamond - 500$. It's balanced but not very extreme."

mcservers,3c9j2o,Bruinman92,1 point,Mon Jul 6 04:15:46 2015 UTC,"haha I had hoped to spook you.   The first question is hard to answer specifically. We have been around for a long while now, and have seen over 150 faces. However, not all 150 play anymore. Infact, probably only around 15-20 play once a month nowadays. We get people who come back after long breaks often, and we have a consistent 4-5 people on. This is why we are advertising - we hope to grow a bit in numbers.  We do not force people to play as teams or together - but there are people who do, so if you are against or for team playing we have it covered.   We do have mumble and many people use Skype, but it just depends on the person - I am sure if you were playing more team based you could use voice comm with them, but it is up to each player, again, we do not force it.  Hosted in Canada, just north of the border. I do think that it affects performance, if that is your concern."
