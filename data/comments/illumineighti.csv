illumineighti,3duwe9,RDWaffle,3,Sun Jul 19 18:36:17 2015 UTC,Can I also just say that  this emote is honestly one of the most adorable things I have ever seen. Seriously.   This is why Sweetie is the mascot of the illumineighti
illumineighti,3duwe9,TheGreatAndPowerful1,3,Sun Jul 19 18:37:59 2015 UTC,She's a pretty awesome character and her stare is some top tier stuff.
illumineighti,3duwe9,Ircza,3,Sun Jul 19 19:01:17 2015 UTC,Like a thousand yard stare that sees into your soul.  She's got some sweet stare game.
illumineighti,3duwe9,Ircza,3,Sun Jul 19 19:12:13 2015 UTC,Y'all suckers now need to read the Stardust fanfic. ASAP.
illumineighti,3dqnbj,Aurelleah,7,Sat Jul 18 14:47:49 2015 UTC,You can try searching +* with the search limit in the setting set to 8806. Although when I tried my web browser crashed for a bit before it stared working. I'm not sure if this is the best solution.
illumineighti,3dqnbj,gabe2252,6,Sat Jul 18 15:56:28 2015 UTC,"If you click on someone else's emote, it'll minimize it and show you the name."
illumineighti,3dqnbj,Cinderheart,6,Sat Jul 18 17:21:39 2015 UTC,oooooooooooo ty
illumineighti,3dqnbj,aidotato5,8,Sat Jul 18 17:58:20 2015 UTC,Same if you hover.
illumineighti,3dle7a,Aurelleah,6,Fri Jul 17 05:26:39 2015 UTC,"[](/flutteryay ""Like this!"")     Just add your text next to the emote name and put it in quotes.  It's invisible to all non-BPM users...except people who use mobile apps to browse Reddit. I know /r/readit displays the raw emote text instead of hiding it. I'm not sure if others do that too.  People who use RES can also click the ""source"" link and see the raw text if they suspect secret pony threads are afoot."
illumineighti,3dle7a,soren121,5,Fri Jul 17 05:58:15 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I've been trying to figure out how to do the hidden text all day.  Edit: english"
illumineighti,3dle7a,Mohanoman,6,Fri Jul 17 06:08:22 2015 UTC,"Not to be rude or anything, but there's a link in the sidebar at /r/mylittlepony which teaches quite a bit about emotes, including hidden text. I didn't think it was that hard to find."
illumineighti,3dle7a,TheGreatAndPowerful1,6,Fri Jul 17 07:33:39 2015 UTC,"oh snap, missed that. I am the dumb."
illumineighti,3dle7a,Mohanoman,5,Fri Jul 17 19:36:59 2015 UTC,"Also worth noting that if you have Android, you can download the Ponymotes app and it will integrate very nicely with the Relay For Reddit app."

illumineighti,3d9ums,Fuzzy_Gauntlets,6,Tue Jul 14 17:01:25 2015 UTC,This whole /r/mylittlepony and /r/SquaredCircle  affair has just been wonderful
illumineighti,3d9ums,TheGreatAndPowerful1,4,Tue Jul 14 20:35:52 2015 UTC,It's been a massive fun fest for everyone
illumineighti,3d9ums,RDWaffle,6,Tue Jul 14 22:00:48 2015 UTC,"This has been work. So many terms, so much meta, but also so much fun."
illumineighti,3d9ums,Hcmyth,4,Wed Jul 15 01:31:09 2015 UTC,"Pretty sure you can still post here.  I won't ban you, if that's what you're wondering!  And I'm glad you're having fun.  I've heard they're pretty inviting."
illumineighti,3d9ums,Hcmyth,4,Wed Jul 15 01:52:36 2015 UTC,Thanks! I need a pony break from time to time. WWE can be intense.
illumineighti,3d9ums,gingertou,5,Wed Jul 15 02:22:53 2015 UTC,"Is.... This is still the wrestling sub, r-right? Must.... continue learning."
illumineighti,3d9ums,Hcmyth,3,Wed Jul 15 05:21:43 2015 UTC,"Have this mesage sent to me from lurker named RipeGripe:Here are some of the sub's favorites:   Undertaker vs Shawn Michaels I: Wrestlemania 25- This match is regarded as one of the best matches in the past decade. Both Shawn Michaels and Undertaker have gained a reputation of being two of the best performers at every Wrestlemania (wrestling's Superbowl). Undertaker vs Shawn Michaels II: Wrestlemania 26- A lot of people say that this match isn't as good as the one from Wrestlemania 25, but this match had more storytelling and more emotional than the previous one. CM Punk vs John Cena: Money in the Bank- This match had the entire fanbase go crazy. This match was a result of CM Punk's ""pipe bomb."". Punk took the mic announced to the world that his contract was expiring soon and had no plans of re-signing. He made it clear that he intends to win the WWE title before he leaves and since he is leaving soon he decides to be a whistleblower. He ranted about all of the legitimate problems that was going on behind the scenes. This promo led to the creation of /r/SquaredCircle. The whole thing blurred the lines between reality and fiction so well that every week people were debating whether some of the stuff was real or not. Daniel Bryan vs Triple H: Wrestlemania 30- This sub was very invested in this storyline. Bryan was an internet darling who struggled in the independent scene before making it into the WWE. In Summerslam 2013, he won the most prestigious title but literally 5 minutes later Triple H came out and screwed him over and made Randy Orton champ. A lot of fans were furious as a result. The following months consisted of Bryan trying to get his title back and gained a crazy amount of fan support. He finally got a chance to fight for the championship but he needed to beat Triple H first. The winner of the match would be placed into the championship match. Here's the Championship match later that night. This video shows Bryan's journey.and now it is."
illumineighti,3d9ums,gingertou,3,Wed Jul 15 05:28:33 2015 UTC,"I've been meaning to watch Undertaker vs. Shawn Michaels  during the Wrestlemania 25, haven't gotten to it yet.  This is what I'm watching right now. You cued me in to Rollins working for the Authority and one of our new wredditor friends sent me the link."
illumineighti,3d9ums,FringePioneer,3,Wed Jul 15 05:46:22 2015 UTC,"Work?  Nonsense!  If I ever had to legitimately forfeit /r/mylittlepony, I would definitely turn heel and use /r/SquaredCircle to take its place."
illumineighti,3d9ums,Hcmyth,3,Wed Jul 15 08:26:14 2015 UTC,"If I had to guess: you would threaten us with a sledge hammer to get mod, than use the mod powers to form a mindless army out of /r/SquaredCircle in order to invade Equestria /r/mylittlepony. One can only hope for a friendship induced face turn  before you succeed."
illumineighti,3d9ums,ksheep,5,Wed Jul 15 09:03:08 2015 UTC,"Quick note: This was the first time I used a full screen capture service.  The final image was cropped down to half its size to what it is now, but that leaves quite a bit of empty comments.  I guess tell me if you prefer one large image or individual screenshots of relevant sections."
illumineighti,3d2qof,Fuzzy_Gauntlets,17,Mon Jul 13 01:34:24 2015 UTC,That's a looooooooot of blankposting there...
illumineighti,3d2qof,Onlyhereforthelaughs,11,Mon Jul 13 04:08:11 2015 UTC,Yes it is.
illumineighti,3d2qof,Onlyhereforthelaughs,12,Mon Jul 13 05:22:53 2015 UTC,Are they trying to expose our secret order?    Because that's how you expose a secret order.
illumineighti,3d2qof,Onlyhereforthelaughs,7,Mon Jul 13 15:12:11 2015 UTC,"We risk exposure every single day, it comes with the territory."
illumineighti,3d2qof,Onlyhereforthelaughs,9,Mon Jul 13 15:42:27 2015 UTC,"True, but blankposting is like throwing a bottle at your feet in The Last of Us. Not the best plan of action."
illumineighti,3d2qof,Onlyhereforthelaughs,7,Mon Jul 13 15:43:26 2015 UTC,"True, but the comment was buried pretty deep to begin with.  How many people show more than the default comment number loaded, and then how many people do that twice?"
illumineighti,3d2qof,ImperatorTempus42,7,Mon Jul 13 16:04:18 2015 UTC,"All I know is it had 3 points. I don't know how big the askreddit thread is, or how far down 3 points would make it. If it had 0, sure. It won't be seen by many, unless they want to know why it was 0.  Blankposting is an unnecessary risk."

illumineighti,35st0h,FringePioneer,3,Wed May 13 05:33:29 2015 UTC,"Because I spend way too much time thinking up civs for the show (Note: this civ is based more on SS before reformation, because I couldn't think of one for after):   The Scymrian Meritocracy: ODLtOTPOTSoRRaAPoCH Sunset Shimmer  UA: Ambition is Magic - 10% discount in researching techs that no one has researched yet. 10% production bonus when building World Wonders. 10% combat bonus against civs with a higher score than you.  UU: Magic-enhanced Demon - Replaces Composite Bowman. 2 more combat strength than the CB, but costs 15% more.

illumineighti,35st0h,FringePioneer,3,Thu May 14 18:17:43 2015 UTC,"Basically, it encourages trying to pull ahead of everyone else and taking risks that lead to great reward if they pan out, which I figure fits Sunset.  The research bonus encourages you to be a trailblazer for new technologies, the Wonder bonus encourages you to build Wonders, which are special building that are very powerful, but you can only reap their benefits if you build them first, so there is an element of risk as you lose out on resources if you fail to build it first. And the combat bonus encourages you to take on stronger opponents whose empires will make greater additions to your own than a weaker opponent's would."

This is the best I've got:   The Equalist Ponies: Mayor Starlight Glimmer  UA: Branded by Equality - all cities founded or captured become Equal cities. All food before percentage modifiers generated by Equal cities are distributed equally between Equal cities. All production generated by Equal cities after percentage bonuses are given to the capital. Any building produced by the capital appears in all Equal cities, and the cost to build a building in the capital is equal to number of Equal cities*building cost*0.9. The same aplies to purchasing building with gold (purchasing causes all cities to have the building, and cost scales up with number of cities). Purchasing units only causes one unit to appear in the city where it was purchased, and producing a unit causes one unit to appear in the capital. All non-one-time effects of national wonders are replicated over all Equal cities (i.e. Heroic Epic provides morale promotion to units created in any city, but Oxford only gives one tech and two slots in the capital). World Wonders appear in the capital.  UB: Cutie Vault: replaces monument. +1 Happiness and half cost to build/buy.  UU: Equalized Pony: Replaces Pikeman. +25% flanking bonus and receives a +10% combat boost if adjacent to another Equalized Pony."

illumineighti,35st0h,TheGreatAndPowerful1,4,Thu May 14 18:39:18 2015 UTC,"It's a really fun game, but ridiculously addicting. I went from sleeping at about 11pm to staying up until 2-3am on a regular basis after getting this game. It has a way of sucking you in so that you just want to finish one more turn.

illumineighti,35st0h,TheGreatAndPowerful1,4,Thu May 14 19:57:34 2015 UTC,"Yeah, if you want to become ""very skilled"" at Civ V, you're looking at a good 500 hours of playtime, possibly a lot more. I've got over 400 and have only beaten the hardest difficulty once with a somewhat cheesy strategy, and others have played thousands of hours and still can't manage that. It's a massive time sink."
illumineighti,35st0h,abccba882,3,Thu May 14 20:02:20 2015 UTC,"I really should try out some of the mods for the game.

We don't have that many members, you're probably better off contacting someone who makes pony gifs or asking on /r/MLPLounge or /r/mylittlepony."

illumineighti,2dz6or,Darktowelie,2,Wed Aug 20 00:24:46 2014 UTC,Reddit News. I used the Ponymotes app which makes it easier to get emotes.
illumineighti,2dnjja,Onlyhereforthelaughs,4,Fri Aug 15 18:02:11 2014 UTC,"How can a mobile user see them?  I don't know.  I can tell you that those with RES can click ""source"" underneath a self-post or a comment to see the Markdown, thus revealing the use of emotes, but I'm not sure how a mobile user who doesn't use BPM or RES can see ponymotes and humanmotes."
illumineighti,2dnjja,FringePioneer,4,Fri Aug 15 20:16:10 2014 UTC,"One of the apps, maybe Reddit News, just puts placeholders in with the name of the emote, but I don't think they see the actual emote picture."
illumineighti,2dnjja,kekerino,3,Sat Aug 16 03:26:31 2014 UTC,What if there's a reddit app with bpm installed or maybe a glitch in the matrix. I have never experienced anything like this myself though.
illumineighti,2dnjja,TheGreatAndPowerful1,2,Fri Aug 15 19:51:37 2014 UTC,Weird reddit  is fun doesn't show emotes i wonder which one does?

illumineighti,2dchem,RDWaffle,3,Wed Aug 13 22:32:31 2014 UTC,"It's more or less proper etiquette, We really don't know who wants their name censored and who don't. It's just easier to censor everyone instead of going around asking people if they're okay with showing their name."
