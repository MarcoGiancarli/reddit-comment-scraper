Especially as I haven't found any books that really focused on the stuff I care about Meaning I've found fandom of celebrities (don't care at all) or a weird/interesting book on female Star Trek fandom in like the 80s (bad memory, could be off) that a friend who is also a PhD student suggested... and not much else.

UniversityofReddit,3dqf14,marshmallowmania,3,Sat Jul 18 14:58:58 2015 UTC,This is a pretty good idea of the content: http://www.tjcs.org/high-school/courses/spanish  It will be somewhat of the UoR format with a little bit of differentiation as this is a language course.  You will be required to complete an oral exam via telephone (voice message through Google Voice.)

There are lectures, homework, and tests... but you do them at your own pace so long as you complete them by the date that they are due.  The courses go as fast as the group can get through the curriculum.  The lessons usually are released in sets of two and each lesson is due in 2 days time... so Lesson 1 will be due 2 days after the course starts, Lesson 2 will be out the day that Lesson 1 is due (sometimes earlier if I finish them), and that will be due 2 days after that.

UniversityofReddit,3b6anx,kirakun,1 point,Fri Jun 26 11:55:03 2015 UTC,"Well, from personal experience:  They change syntax pretty often. Suddenly your three-months-old project refuses to compile due to slight syntax changes and you have to go through all places something changed. Ok, minor annoyance, but takes time.  Most third party libraries are written in Objective-c and using that code in your project is a pain. This is a biggest issue, since you will use a lot of third party libraries in your code.  A lot of work for iOS developer is extending and supporting projects, and since those are written in Objective-c, you need to know that.       As a hobby, it is fine. You won't have to mess with old stuff, and production environment quirks. But after you know Objective-C, learning Swift is a matter of days/weeks.  Only the first language is hard."

UniversityofReddit,2zf1ud,redog,4,Wed Mar 18 20:48:18 2015 UTC,IMO a gentoo install from stage 1 is the gentoo class.  [edit]: #gentoo @irc.freenode.net

UniversityofReddit,2zf1ud,redog,1 point,Wed Mar 18 20:45:31 2015 UTC,Stage 1 and stage 2 aren't provided anymore is what I thought...
UniversityofReddit,2zf1ud,redog,1 point,Wed Mar 18 15:32:11 2015 UTC,"They aren't the official way anymore but the process is still there and Gentoo still provides stage1 and stage2 tarballs but a stage3 can be used to bootstrap the system.   It's been awhile but essentially the only difference is the bootstrap and an emerge -e system.   To bootstrap the system, perform a stage3 installation cd /usr/portage/scripts ./bootstrap.sh emerge -e system continue by configuring the kernel   It's not advised for users because a lot can go wrong in the toolchain build and users tend to muck around with CFLAGS sometimes causing a bit of chaos when trying to help them troubleshoot builds. Once you hose the toolchain you often need to stage3 again....  To be honest even a stage3 install of gentoo is basically a class on the settings for the hardware you're working with. That was my favorite part about learning to install gentoo. That it forces you to learn the intimate details about your hardware. It's also the pitfall if you miss details."

UniversityofReddit,2utp2s,ProbablyAn00bis,4,Thu Feb 5 01:57:42 2015 UTC,"What it basically comes down to, are the three options that the ball handler has at all times:  Pass  Dribble  Shoot  If there is a wide open guy - or just a guy in a better position, than the current ball handler - the ball handler will pass.  If he believes he is in the best position himself, but not open, or can get a better shot by dribbling, he will dribble.  If he is wide open, or he believes he has the best shot of the 24 seconds, he will shoot.  The interesting thing about basketball is the flexibility of the two teams. The offense will cut, set screens etc. in an attempt to draw attention to, or away from themselves, to create more empty space on the floor, where they can set up an open shot.  The other thing that's interesting, without getting too technical, is change of speed/change of direction. That's the premise of one-on-one basketball. That's what makes dribbling so beautiful in basketball. Guy slowly dribbles left wards up the court, boom! he crossed to the right and takes it all the way home."
UniversityofReddit,2utp2s,hamfraigaar,1 point,Thu Feb 5 11:28:45 2015 UTC,"Not sure how to teach this, in a purely theoretical way. I play basketball for close to 20 years now, however none of the teams I played on had a super-extensive playbook or so. Maybe 5 plays that were used regularly max., plus a couple options in them. On a lower level, ""pseudo plays"", such as isolation or pick and roll / pop usually worked better."

He reliably produces on or two or even three massive articles per week that get into the minutae of the NBA. He routinely uses pics, gifs, and videos to illustrate his point about how players and teams are (un)successful. I've really learned a lot about basketball from him and Kirk Goldsberry, who is more on the stats side of things.  For example, here is his 3,000 word writeup this week on the Clippers: http://grantland.com/the-triangle/time-for-your-western-conference-wake-up-call-dont-sleep-on-the-clippers/"

UniversityofReddit,2utp2s,soapdealer,1 point,Fri Feb 6 01:15:57 2015 UTC,Best book I can recommend for learning basketball strategy from an analytic perspective is Dean Oliver's Basketball on Paper.
UniversityofReddit,2utp2s,soapdealer,3,Fri Feb 6 01:18:53 2015 UTC,"Sorry to say, but you are most likely dead wrong about these things. I know people who regularly play basketball and watch basketball and still don't understand the fundamentals. There's a big difference between doing and seeing. Teaching it is another story.   Haha, I didn't mean to come across as knowledgeable about these things. My point was, I don't really care about learning fundamentals of shooting/passing/dribbling a basketball because as a viewer who never plays, it doesn't matter to me as much as understanding strategy does.   The x's and o's coach K might draw on his board will demonstrate only a few basic things like a cut, a pass and a screen, but there is hours of practice put in for players to be ready to make a play like that.   I used to play a LOT of Madden as a kid, and became really familiar with the playbook. One of the games (I think 06 or 08) introduced a playmaker feature where you could add offenses with routes/blocks or defensive sets to your team's playbook. I learned so much about football like this, and learned how complex every play from scrimmage is.  Obviously basketball isn't quite as complex because there's 5 players instead of 11. But what exactly is going on, for example, when a point guard backs up to midcourt and holds up a number, with his coach barking at him from the sideline? Are they running a carefully designed play, or just setting screens, making cuts, and passing on the fly, hoping something happens?"
UniversityofReddit,2utp2s,Seven_Cuil_Sunday,1 point,Thu Feb 5 03:24:38 2015 UTC,"Actually, I'd argue that basketball is more complex and challenging to understand, because unlike football, you don't reset to a 'static' point every few seconds. 'Plays' are like an infinite series of options, designed to force the defense into making choices that leave a player open for a clear shot/path to the basket. That means the offensive player (both with and without the ball) must make instantaneous decisions about something like whether to cut for the basket or pop out for a jumper based on something as subtle as which way the defender's feet are pointed.   The lay of the land (IE, the number of people on the court and the size of the court) also makes it much easier to spontaneously take advantage of a mistake or open player in basketball, making for, IMO, a more exciting game.   I'm sure there's some stuff on the web that talks about various offensive sets and strategies, like the infamous Triangle Offense run  by the Bulls in the Jordan era, or the run-and-gun) of old school Lakers teams. (although 'run-and-gun' is to some degree about DE-emphasizing set plays, and I guess it's more 'mid-school' Lakers than old-school Lakers.)   TL;DR: Basketball is awesome."
UniversityofReddit,2utp2s,iamthekevinator,1 point,Thu Feb 5 03:38:51 2015 UTC,"Football is like chess, you have to position your pieces and out maneuver your opponent.    Basketball is like chess or checkers but you only have a few seconds to make each move. The overall strategies might not be super complex (checkers) or they could be incredibly complex(chess). Regardless you have a short amount of time to make decisions and reactions."
UniversityofReddit,2utp2s,aspbergerinparadise,1 point,Thu Feb 5 08:46:14 2015 UTC,"As someone else has said, teams will typically have a handful of set plays, and additionally they will also run smaller parts of those plays independently.    When you see the point guard holding up a number, that is a designed play.  They will either do this, or they will react to how the defense is positioned and start running smaller movements designed to set picks for those defenders.  I think what would help you the most is just to start looking at some designed plays on youtube, like this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TiZOBHYhig  That will give you an idea as to what a player is thinking about when a play is called.  Other things that a team will practice are more unique scenarios.  When I played in high school, we had 2 or 3 different plays we would run when in-bounding a ball (typically those only apply when the opposing team is running a full-court press).  And we'd also practice some fast-break scenarios."

You're right though; its not a physical island of large objects as some narratives incorrectly suggest. They are instead comprised of the smaller plastic pellets you mentioned, called nurdles, that can be small as some phytoplankton (although some can be relatively large) or as big as a pea! Have you ever used face wash with those ""micro scrubbing beads""? Well that's a great example of the source of some nurdles.

You're talking about putting a senior-level topic in a freshman-level course.   The actual simulation part is fairly easy once you have the full transportation engineering curriculum in your head so that you know what to actually input into the software. Speaking of the software, traffic simulation software is very expensive and companies charge hundreds of dollars just for a seat in a training course on how to use their software, let alone the software itself. The companies will also give away copies to universities to use in their computer labs, but they are not going to give away copies to a free Reddit university course."

I was thinking the core concepts of simulation could covered in a one or two hour lecture without going into detail and actually needing to physically do the micro-simulation module.  Maybe SUMO or MATsim could be utilized??  Introductory doesn't necessarily need to be a freshman course. Perhaps a course for people who have completed a Bachelor and Masters degree in Civil Engineering and are now interested in Transport (that describes me).Also, I self-taught myself PTV Vissim in the last 3months (the first 2-month being limited to the trial). I'm sure a course of sorts could be put together, although maybe not a freshman course.

The topics that are suggested on the wiki are also almost entirely concerned with theory and design; the section that mentions ""practical fundamentals"" is miniscule.    These simply do not lend themselves well or succinctly enough to improving the capabilities of a technician or electrician in their day-to-day duties -- I'd assume this is written by designers or academics for designers and academics, whether professional or hobbyist.  The audience I am part of is blue collar technicians that have little to no formal education, and just need what they need to quickly and safely resolve issues in the field.  They don't need to know ohms law-- they need to know how to tell a bad resistor from a good one.  They don't need to know the theory of transmission lines, they just need to know how to properly megger and ring out a cable.  They don't need to know how to perform Fourier or Laplace transforms, they need to know how to use an oscilloscope or a sniffer to measure signals and then track down/fix a ground when they find they've lost said signal.  They especially need to understand safety in a practical way-- how they can isolate power and keep themselves safe in sometimes high voltage environments with ground straps, for example (actually the wiki page does have a nice writeup for some of this:  https://www.reddit.com/r/ToobAmps/wiki/safety).    I hope this makes sense-- I don't mean to minimize the importance of a strong background of this sort for some people, but I do want to emphasize that not everyone that works with electricity needs or has the capability of achieving such a background and I believe there is an informational void for such individuals."
UniversityofReddit,2pm7ke,meangrampa,2,Thu Dec 18 01:25:05 2014 UTC,"It's like trying to get a drivers license by just taking the written test and refusing to read the learners manual first. Understanding what each part does isn't enough to get a true understanding of how a circuit is supposed to perform. The basics start at ohms law. Granted an understanding of ohms law isn't required to wire a house to a blueprint, but you've got to know how to read the blueprint. To gain a true understanding of electronic circuits and how they function you've got to know why they function. Without being able to do the math there is no way to understand what is shown on an oscilloscope. Sure if you were to be part of an assembly line and someone else that understood it were to set everything up for you, you could perform a simple setting of a coil. You wouldn't understand why this setting was important or what it's purpose was or how it related to the output of the circuit.   The maths aren't that hard. The US army taught a few thousands troops these skills in 8 weeks in WWII and these troops were sleep deprived and had somebody yelling at them the whole time. This needn't be a part you skip and it really can't be if you want to truly understand electronics.   I don't know how this course could be taught without covering the main parts of theory. I'll take it if it comes up just because I'd like to see it done and I could always use a refresher."
UniversityofReddit,2pm7ke,Pennyw1se,2,Thu Dec 18 02:32:33 2014 UTC,"Hmm, I don't think that's what OP is saying (though I think the first example of not having to know Ohm's law was a bit stretching it). I think the point being made was that the links provided touch upon basic theory, sure, but they quickly transition into engineering and design topics (like most courses fund all over the internet do).  I'm willing to bet a lot of cash that the military did not teach their techs (drawing directly from the topics in the wiki linked):  derivatives, integrals, Taylor series, Kirchhoff's Laws, Thévenin's Theorem, Laplace Transforms, Fourier Transforms, numeration systems, calculus, and/or differential equations.    I think OP is looking for a crash course on theory followed by real-world maintenance/repair type topics.   There really isn't a course out there I know of online that provides that; it's something I'd imagine a trade school or, yea, a military training program providing.  In fact, I bet a lot of this sort of stuff is on-the-job training or apprenticeships, and hasn't been well documented/organized into a class.   My two cents:  I'm in agreement-- there is definitely a void like OP says and I'd totally participate in this class if there's anyone out there willing to teach it."
UniversityofReddit,2pm7ke,meangrampa,1 point,Thu Dec 18 03:18:14 2014 UTC,"I think OP wants a crash course on theory followed by wiring, troubleshooting and safety topics; I agree you don't see much of that out there.   Agreed. Techs don't need differential equations. These things are for advanced design and there isn't a ""crash course"" for electronics. I'd take this course if it was presented. The hard part is, will the teacher be able to keep it simple without going off an a design tangent? The ones best able to teach the basics know design well too. It's reigning themselves in that's the hard part. It's all closely related and far too easy to get into the more complicated portions of the subject. I'd like to see somebody try to do it."
UniversityofReddit,2pm7ke,Pennyw1se,2,Thu Dec 18 03:25:33 2014 UTC,"Sorry I edited a bit on you once I re-read OPs write-up, but the same flavor holds.  I think most teachers are going to go off on design tangents unless they are in the ""blue collar"" group mentioned (who probably aren't all over the internet making videos like the engineers/professors/academic-types are honestly)."
UniversityofReddit,2pm7ke,Pennyw1se,1 point,Thu Dec 18 03:31:53 2014 UTC,"I had no doubt there were more extensive training programs, but (in context) I was responding to the notion of the military teaching ""thousands of troops"" these skills in ""8 weeks"" during world war ii."
UniversityofReddit,2pm7ke,SydJester,1 point,Thu Dec 18 04:27:18 2014 UTC,"This whole post makes no sense in terms of the target audience you are specifying.  There is no reason you should ever be hired as a technician or especially as an electrician without having a formal background  in these fields. The things you want to know make sense for a homeowner or hobbyist not someone being paid to do the job. I don't know where you live where you can get a job specifically working with electrical circuits without some sort of accredited education, but I can assure you it is a place I want to avoid."
UniversityofReddit,2pm7ke,SydJester,2,Thu Dec 18 06:31:08 2014 UTC,"You can go ahead and make your brash statement about my post as a whole because of one phrase, but formal education was just a poor choice of words on my part.  Perhaps what I should have said was ""degree"" or ""theoretical background"", as formal education can technically be anything from a fast track training program to a PhD.  The point of the post was that the usefulness of most of the theory described on that wiki and in most of the courses you find littered around the net (which are geared towards designers/engineers) is minimal to most of the blue collars working out there in the field."
UniversityofReddit,2pm7ke,SydJester,2,Thu Dec 18 17:51:13 2014 UTC,"Maybe I'm just misunderstanding what you're asking about, but it sounds like you want an online course on how to do the job you've already been hired to do.  What you're asking for makes sense to me for a person who is thinking about starting an electrical apprenticeship, but hasn't been hired yet or someone who wants to start repairing things around the home.  I just can't understand why, if you're already working in the field, you wouldn't already have learned how to use measurement tools and how to work safely or why the company you work for wouldn't have resources to train you.  What I do know, is that where I'm from, if your going to be working with circuits, you would know how to already, or you would be paired with someone who does to train you.  I'm not saying the information you're asking for isn't useful or worthwhile, it just really freaks me out that your asking for information on how to do a job you're saying you already have."
UniversityofReddit,2pm7ke,syberdragon,2,Fri Dec 19 05:15:13 2014 UTC,"No need to ""freak out""-- I never said the course would be for me personally, though I'm sure I'd pick up at least a few things I don't know, and it would be a great refresher on some of the equipment I don't use daily."
UniversityofReddit,2pm7ke,Murphdog024,2,Fri Dec 19 14:49:51 2014 UTC,"Sorry, I tend to be unnecessarily harsh.  I'm not actually trying to shit on your idea.  It just struck me as an odd demographic for what you were requesting.  Perhaps try building a community of experienced workers to discuss whatever questions anyone has.  You could build a wiki of your assembled knowledge."

UniversityofReddit,2ny55l,wspaniel,4,Mon Dec 1 15:54:43 2014 UTC,"The class is about half way done. New lectures appear on the YouTube mirror two or three times a week, with a break scheduled at the end of December. I will post an update to /r/universityofreddit when the class finishes.  I just want to be clear that this course is technical. It is not ""this is how you should politely ask your boss for more money."" Rather, the lectures focus on under what conditions your boss, car dealer, or flea marketeer will have to cave to your demands. It also serves as a technical guide for readers of the associated book, Game Theory 101: Bargaining. As such, expect plenty of math.  After this course wraps up, my next project will be on applied bargaining theory, which will focus more on explaining why real world bargaining works the way it does. Examples could range from Deal or No Deal to sports free agency to current negotiations between the United States and Iran!"
