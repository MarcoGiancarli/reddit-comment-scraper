OnePieceTC,3e3b23,yespadrille,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:20:54 2015 UTC,He is like a slightly better version of the gear 3 Luffy. After Good->Great->Perfect he gives a 4xatk buff. And his special deals 50k-200k non type specific damage :D
OnePieceTC,3e3b23,Ninjafro,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:19:49 2015 UTC,"He's called Log Luffy, his captain ability is very similar to G3 and his special gives him a STR orb and deals neutral damage to all enemies iirc. Awesome art imo :D"

OnePieceTC,3e3enb,dragonballk100,6,Tue Jul 21 17:30:57 2015 UTC,Killer's evolved attack.  Nice timing and looks cool.  Garp's is pretty fun too.
OnePieceTC,3e3enb,Ironman2131,3,Tue Jul 21 17:53:04 2015 UTC,First time I used Killer I completely missed the attack because I was too busy watching the animation.  It is definitely one of the more creative ones.
OnePieceTC,3e3enb,Kinnikufan,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:59:47 2015 UTC,yeah killer is awesome
OnePieceTC,3e3enb,tadabola,6,Tue Jul 21 19:57:55 2015 UTC,Currently evolved X-Drake. Hard to argue with a T-rex chomp!
OnePieceTC,3e3enb,Dr__Horrible,4,Tue Jul 21 19:23:26 2015 UTC,Basil Hawkins attack animation though...
OnePieceTC,3e3enb,Tvingman,4,Tue Jul 21 19:08:19 2015 UTC,I like Garps and Law's Room! iT'S AWESOME
OnePieceTC,3e3enb,MightGuy8Gates,3,Tue Jul 21 20:31:02 2015 UTC,"Most of the animations that aren't just straight up attacks (like punches or slashes) are fantastic.  Kid and his metal arm crush, or even his metal ball throw in his 4* is really fun to watch. X Drake, like many people have said, turns into a T-Rex and there's no way that's not awesome. Marco is also cool, swooping in and kicking his opponents in his half-Logia form. Log Chopper is also really cute! He goes from his regular form into his Arm Point form while still having his crown.  Law and Robin are probably two of my favorites. Law makes his Room, and Robin doing her usual arm cross like she does for most attacks really exemplifies the characters."
OnePieceTC,3e3enb,xAndrenx,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:45:02 2015 UTC,"I do love Marco's animation, though it is worth noting he is a Mythic Zoan (Phoenix model) type - better than a Logia!"
OnePieceTC,3e3enb,CountFranklin,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:14:56 2015 UTC,"My favourite ones so far are probably Killer (evolved) and G2 Luffy. As for sprites, I quite like evolved Shanks, G2 Luffy and unevolved Mihawk :)"
OnePieceTC,3e3enb,Ninjafro,2,Tue Jul 21 18:30:31 2015 UTC,"Can't decide on my favorite attack, but for some reason one of my favorite sprites is Don Krieg, because to me his mouth looks like a mustache, and I just picture him being old snake from Metal Gear Solid 4"
OnePieceTC,3e3enb,Kirkambrose,2,Tue Jul 21 21:55:51 2015 UTC,"Probably Rayleigh because Kamehameha. Log Luffy might be my favorite sprite though, because he's getting the meat he deserves."

OnePieceTC,3e3enb,day2k,2,Tue Jul 21 19:06:09 2015 UTC,"thats why I really think there should be a ""costume"" system. unevolved SW zoro and unevolved SW brooke are awesome. there should be an option for you to evolve and choose what sprite to atack"
OnePieceTC,3e3enb,tadabola,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:34:30 2015 UTC,"yea I agree, I have SW Usopp and SW Robin, and I love both of them [unevolved]  However, changing the costumes/sprites will change the attack timing, and I dont think Bandai will allow that because it's such a big part of the game...unless they make the timing the same..."
OnePieceTC,3e3enb,day2k,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:05:25 2015 UTC,I think it wouldn't be hard to change the atk timing as well. even the more complex ones like killer's

I also like monster chopper, sanji. kidd, paulie, killer, tashigi, kuro, shanks (only evolved) and coby.   The ones I don't like are: g2 (to steamy), asura zoro (actually most zoros with the headband on), sogeking (should be way more epic), evolved mihawk (don't really click), and alvida (seems weird, she should be prettier). I also don't like that vivi is on carue"

OnePieceTC,3e36m9,rayleighisop1,5,Tue Jul 21 16:36:54 2015 UTC,"The thing is I was able to get to stage 19. The trick is to take  Marco/Marco/ Garp / Django / Coby / Golden pound.  stage 1-12 is just stalling and killing.  stage 13 is bursting kuro and django.  stage 14 is easy just kill them and stall on don krieg before he attacks.  stage 15 you have to burst arlong and then kill hatchi. You will get dmg by hatchi and with some minimal meat luck you will kill him without your x9 bonus after a few rounds. You will probably survive him with 40% hp and get the preemptive from stage 16.  Stage 16 get the preemtive heal max with marco and use django + coby to burst them all.  Stage 17 use golden pound kill  tashigi and bring smoker over 21% hp and try to get some meat orbs. You will have to stall 6 rounds on him. So burst him to about 25% then use garp ult to get some meat orbs to heal to max health. With some huge meat orb luck you will be able to stall another 3 rounds (6 rounds all in all) on him with getting 2 x 5500 dmg.  Stage 18 just burst them.  Stage 19:  If you had meat orb luck and you could stall long enough you can use God lysopp after bursting Lysopp in 1 round.  Stage 20. Use marco full heal for the preemptive burst him in 2 Rounds.  My levels are: Max Marco/ 73 Marco / 43 Django / Max golden pound / 71 Garp / 64 Coby.  I still couldn't do it because of lack of my ""huge meat orb luck"" :("
OnePieceTC,3e36m9,bitereality,2,Tue Jul 21 17:06:49 2015 UTC,"my issue is stage 19, cant use gp usopp since its at 15cd. if i had max usopp it wouldnt be, but till kuro isle returns... i always got close to killing luffy and lose there since i cant use gp usopp on strawhat stage. My levels are high though. You might want to switch out django for someone like mihawk, yu'll probably have a better chance."

OnePieceTC,3e36m9,bitereality,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:10:48 2015 UTC,garp special  Eidt  plus usopp special. Heal the premptive and negate the bad orbs in one swoop
OnePieceTC,3e36m9,wildcat2084,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:15:37 2015 UTC,"use marco special on stage 17 instead, you can farm for matching orbs on the umbrella girl in previous stage. Just tank the damage till your captain is unlocked b4 using marco to full heal."

OnePieceTC,3e36m9,KSmoria,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:08:43 2015 UTC,Due to preemptive attack he probably can't. It should be doable with a double Garp tho

However I only got to round 19 and got slaughtered by zoro, sanji, and luffy. However if I used my specials more strategically I may have been able to beat it.   The team I brought along was; Garp, Mr2,Marco, coby, and GP Usopp."

My team has marco, garp, golden pound usopp, coby and alvida. I'm having trouble finding friend marco captains though since turtle time is over. Damn I should have swapped alvida for streaming wolf swords zoro- it will get luffy's attack to 0 and would be really helpful."

OnePieceTC,3e33lz,Devin__,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:22:42 2015 UTC,"Yes, powering up the same characters is usually the best option.  Not just for the experience boost, but also for the chance at a special level.  The Usopps you might just want to fuse to whoever could use experience if you already have GP maxed.  And the extra Cobys can be used on whoever needs it as well (or just be sold).  Killer, Law, and Apu should definitely be powered up with themselves and the sooner the better since the skill-up event will be ending soon."
OnePieceTC,3e33lz,Kinnikufan,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:18:36 2015 UTC,"Use the duplicates to power up the same character only of they have the same special name.  Some units change special when they evolve, so it's always good to check.  If the unit was recruited at level 20 it may be worth feeding anyway for the exp and same character bonus, but most level 5 recruits without the same special will not be worth feeding, and can be sold."
OnePieceTC,3e33lz,Oedipustrexeliot,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:19:21 2015 UTC,"In general, yes, I just feed duplicates to the same characters to try to get skill ups. However, there are a few exceptions here and there. Streaming Wolf Swords Zoro has the unique ability to nullify STR damage and loses this ability when evolved, so people like to keep a copy of his unevolved form for the ability.

OnePieceTC,3e1w0y,gvon89,2,Tue Jul 21 16:19:00 2015 UTC,Don't forget the fortnight island. So that's 16 gems.
OnePieceTC,3e1w0y,andrekenny,2,Tue Jul 21 10:13:13 2015 UTC,can you do the miss monday mission with a captain friend who has her?
OnePieceTC,3e1w0y,hkreeves,3,Tue Jul 21 12:58:18 2015 UTC,No
OnePieceTC,3e1w0y,andrekenny,2,Tue Jul 21 13:59:29 2015 UTC,"well that sucks, not sure if its worth farming her. Thanks anyway"
OnePieceTC,3e1w0y,hkreeves,2,Tue Jul 21 14:32:28 2015 UTC,"No hurry. And she is a 2* drop like patty and carne, so chance is not slim. Just try maybe one time on 2x every week."

OnePieceTC,3e2gx3,Gol-D-R0ger,4,Tue Jul 21 13:17:41 2015 UTC,New story islands used to be at 00:00 and fortnights at 19:00 but they most likely changed the times to release both at the same time with the new app version release due to a possible maintenance.

OnePieceTC,3e0lo4,opoptc,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:54:09 2015 UTC,oh i see what you mean. that is a great idea that might work. Most raid bosses nowadays are set up to prevent zombie farming but that is a good new tactic.

OnePieceTC,3e2s6n,Mordecaibest,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:52:13 2015 UTC,It's doable but it definitely depends on the cd on Garp.  If it's too high then a lot of luck is required when stalling.  Should be fine if Garp has maxed or close to maxed special level.
OnePieceTC,3e2s6n,FellatioRex,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:57:52 2015 UTC,G3 can clear almost everything

OnePieceTC,3e3len,Shawncertain,0,Tue Jul 21 22:16:20 2015 UTC,yeah i got chopper and nami so far
OnePieceTC,3e3len,archevil,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:25:23 2015 UTC,I got chopper both times sadly. And i dont know if you guys noticed this but it gives a gem every time you play it which is pretty cool.
OnePieceTC,3e3len,wildcat2084,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:36:12 2015 UTC,u can use them in monster chopper
OnePieceTC,3e3len,Byronlove9,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:01:58 2015 UTC,I know I thought of doing that but I dont have Monster Chopper yet so hopefully he'll come back soon so I can put Chopper to good use.
OnePieceTC,3e3len,wildcat2084,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:06:15 2015 UTC,I got Nami twice.

OnePieceTC,3e2vr7,With_Hands_And_Paper,2,Tue Jul 21 17:21:54 2015 UTC,"It's not just a WB and Ray fresh, it's a WB + Gear 3. The Gear 3 and extra P-lvl edges it out in favor of your original account.  It doesn't really matter whether which account can clear all contents, in my opinion. A double monster chopper team with the right subs is a better team than either Ray or WB for Doflamingo, for example. What's important is not missing out on raidbosses and leveling your units.  Plus, you realize that Enel is literally months and months away. Like a good 7 months at the minimum. In a span of time that long, pretty much anything goes. You might have a technique slasher team using the coffin boat, which is the best suited team for that raidboss anyways.  tl;dr  G3 + WB makes the first account more worth it / It's really no use worrying about a raidboss that will take half a year to arrive."
OnePieceTC,3e2vr7,troubled_bison,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:30:16 2015 UTC,"Heya, seems like you know a few things about Enel so I need to ask: do you know if a Double Asura/Double Law team with Apoo, Mihawk, Paulie and Doffy can take out Enel 60 stam?"
OnePieceTC,3e2vr7,With_Hands_And_Paper,2,Tue Jul 21 15:49:59 2015 UTC,"Possibly. Though if you have a Mihawk and/or a Doffy, I think it'd honestly be less of a hassle to just go the Double Mihawk or Mihawk & Doffy route.  I know there was a team that cleared 60 stam Enel using Asura captain with a Mihawk friend captain- the subs were Doffy, Mihawk, Doublefinger (Assuming Global will get her before Doffy arrives), and GP Ussop. That guy had all of his units maxed though."
OnePieceTC,3e2vr7,bitereality,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:58:10 2015 UTC,"True that, there's still a long way before we get Enel so who knows how much things will change but for now seeing as my luck with upgrading Merry is abysmally low Idk if by the time Enel hits us I'll manage to have Coffin Boat maxed and run a Slasher team with it."
OnePieceTC,3e2vr7,onedreampiece,2,Tue Jul 21 16:10:08 2015 UTC,"not double asura, but law and apoo are in this team with mihawk and doffy  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-RHp88z_8Q&list=PLXfucIDqiDplsDBqlcSlrO1iCxyCeGXQ9&index=45  oh, wb g3 is the better account. Combination of those 2 in my opinion gives it the leg up on the ray account and it being farther ahead."
OnePieceTC,3e2vr7,troubled_bison,-1,Tue Jul 21 17:27:45 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your opinion. Just a side question, but I want to know whether G3 can clear raidboss(es) which Rayleigh can or not. If G3 can somewhat play the role of Ray, then I have no more worry about raidbosses that WB has trouble with.  Not related to the topic, congratz on your p-lv 300. It will take me ages to get to that level. Keep up the good work buddy xD"
OnePieceTC,3e2vr7,MonicaOPTC,2,Tue Jul 21 15:38:11 2015 UTC,"I agree with troubled bison stick with wb account. Wb+g3>rayleigh. Also, when wb skill books come out wb really shines. Wb cant clear enel (idk maybe now it can with the new special passive that ignores map stage attacks) but everything will be doable as you farm other raid bosses"
OnePieceTC,3e2vr7,pakxmanx21,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:58:36 2015 UTC,"Doubt that G3 can clear Enel. But again. A double Doflamingo team can clear Enel. Doflamingo is farmable with G3 and WB.   That's how this game sort of works in my experience so far. You build momentum as you go.  Those with high level Monster Chopper will be able to farm Doffy. In turn, having Doffy will let you farm Enel. Having a Garp (and the right PSY units) will let you farm Zephyr in the most efficient way.  Don't get me wrong though- if you insist that you want a guarantee of being able to clear the raidboss with the 6* that you are starting out with, Rayleigh is an excellent unit to start out an account with.  (I just happen to spend more time/gems than people usually do. Nothing super difficult or skilled about what I do, heh. But thanks!)"
OnePieceTC,3e2vr7,MrKoontar,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:45:54 2015 UTC,"Personally Rayleigh is slightly better but you WB account at this point is far more worth while, Than going through the whole process of leveling and gaining teams and raidboss's, i mean you have gear 3rd Luffy which is always great, Mihawk which is great. why give all of it up just for Rayleigh at this point."
OnePieceTC,3e2vr7,MrKoontar,0,Tue Jul 21 15:22:43 2015 UTC,"I still wonder, whether G3 is able to play the role of Rayleigh in raidbosses that WB can't defeat, or he will never be the same tier with Ray. I heard that Enel/Enei is a good unit, having him will be a goal for any player in the future. That's why I'm worry, since I decided to stop rolling on WB account, only saving gem for refilling, which means that I won't have any new gatcha-only unit."
OnePieceTC,3e2vr7,Isy786,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:29:30 2015 UTC,you should save the gems for wb's book special which should be like a month or so away.
OnePieceTC,3e2vr7,_Madara_,0,Tue Jul 21 15:38:14 2015 UTC,"Thanks for information. I definitely will, since WB is my best character, so maxing him will be my goal. Cheer :)"

OnePieceTC,3e2vr7,Kinayalol,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:50:15 2015 UTC,"Leveling up is fun and part of the game.  If you really like Ray then work on that account is my opinion. btw, I thought someone did post a video of wb vs enel on this forum.  Can't remember who."
OnePieceTC,3e2vr7,Oedipustrexeliot,0,Tue Jul 21 15:31:21 2015 UTC,"Personally, leveling up is fun if you are using an account with low cost units like G3. For me, it was a real pain to lv-ing that WB account to 80, I failed so many missions and maps before I can make a good team out of that :( But yea, if WB can clear Enel, then, I will stick to my WB account."
OnePieceTC,3e2vr7,Oedipustrexeliot,2,Tue Jul 21 15:44:09 2015 UTC,"WB can't clear Enel and Duval (yet, he might be able to do it with the new abilities introduced in 4.0) but slasher teams can. Just use your WB or G3 to farm Mihawk and Doflamingo then use them for those raids."

OnePieceTC,3dzuff,day2k,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:22:45 2015 UTC,"So does it boosted rate apply for each individual unit? That is awesome, probably the best ability to have besides the unlock and unsealed abilities (maybe the heal as well). But I would think they would make these better abilities rarer."
OnePieceTC,3dzuff,rubbertrain12,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:54:45 2015 UTC,"That's what it reads as. It also makes sense because otherwise in a rainbow team, how do you determine which orb rate to boost?"
OnePieceTC,3dzuff,beardedheathen,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:03:23 2015 UTC,"Yup, I agree. Initially, I just thought it seems very OP to have this particular ability applies to each unit. So maybe it boosted the orb rate of the ability owner. E.g. if SW Ace (green) and WB (red) owns this ability it will boost green orb and red orb only. But after doing my research and doing more reading, it seems you are right. Cheers man!!"
OnePieceTC,3e2otb,Zilas,4,Tue Jul 21 14:25:29 2015 UTC,"My personal preferences:  Purple - turtle time on Mondays  Yellow - Syrup Village 2 (may get purple instead, hardest to farm for)  Red - Orange Town 7 (may get seahorses instead)  Blue - Orange Town 8 (may get seahorses instead)  Green - Orange Town 9 (may get seahorses instead)  Also, it is recommended that you save your keys for when the chance for super-success is doubled.  Some people even say to save keys until Global gets every color of turtle time weekly."

Currently can't use any of my fully evolved porcs because I don't need experience, If I evolve one of my characters they will cost too much.

OnePieceTC,3e2otb,Kinnikufan,2,Tue Jul 21 14:46:07 2015 UTC,"No problem.  And if you're looking for things to do with your gems, a lot of people are saving for the (please, please soon) box increase Global will eventually get and others are saving in order to refill stamina to farm specific event islands and raid bosses.  And of course there's always saving up for Sugofest to potentially get a 6* character.  Just a few options to consider."
OnePieceTC,3e2otb,FellatioRex,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:56:53 2015 UTC,"I'm still chilling with 100 box space (noob here) so that's not a big deal for me just yet, I feel like next sugofest is gonna take a while and I won't have the patience or run out of characters to level up before it happens ..Right now I need to level up to increase my party cost so that I can evolve my mihawk and then arlong after, those 2 should keep me busy for a while.. Will just wait and see what the next rare recruit event is. I'm also gonna try and keep around 5 rainbow gems at all times for random events."
OnePieceTC,3e2otb,KSmoria,2,Tue Jul 21 19:44:54 2015 UTC,IMO don't use your keys as you get them from the friend game.  Use them when you have the room and time and need to evolve your porcs and use them.
OnePieceTC,3e2otb,MrKoontar,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:59:04 2015 UTC,"Seems to be the best way to go about it indeed, Just got porcs in my inventory from my first 2 runs ever, didn't realize they would be this difficult to evolve (although definitely worth) Probably gonna just collect keys untill more color varied turtle times happen .. Unless I really need experience fast in which case i'll use a few keys:p"
OnePieceTC,3e2otb,MrKoontar,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:47:08 2015 UTC,5 sta Khalifa for red/greens. 5 sta Lucci for blue/greens. And the occasional yellow turtle islands.
OnePieceTC,3e226x,Goldfire14,11,Tue Jul 21 10:31:07 2015 UTC,"Usopp -> crab evolution  Luffy -> one way  Zoro, Sanji -> no crab evolution, since it allows u to evolve them again lvl 35 instead of 50  Nami -> crab evolution, this is the best version due to her special that blocks INT attack for 1 turn, do not evolve her to 5* version"
OnePieceTC,3e226x,wagner_46,2,Tue Jul 21 10:34:03 2015 UTC,"My shame is still supreme for rushing to build a Thunderbolt Tempo Nami during my Garp preparations, only to ultimately end up using Laboon to get him.  I really wish I had a Mirage Tempo, but I guess I'm waiting for a bad Sugo pull or Kimono Nami from the Kimono Strawhats Isle.  At least Kimono Nami will have better stats, though."
OnePieceTC,3e226x,Ezrius,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:48:37 2015 UTC,"No worries. Since you are starting (I suppose) her use for now is against Zephyr, which you won't be able to farm unless you've got decent levels. Anyways, I'd highly recommend to evolve Zoro first, since we are getting Lucci's island."
OnePieceTC,3e226x,wagner_46,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:03:16 2015 UTC,"Thanks, that definitely clears that up"
OnePieceTC,3e226x,drunkenrabbit_,4,Tue Jul 21 10:49:17 2015 UTC,"Zoro and Sanji have a very good 5* evolutions, go for them.    Mirage Tempo Nami (4* second form, the one you evolve with the crab) can entirely block and INT attack for 1 turn, which is very useful. I would keep her at least until Kimono Nami comes to global, who has the same special.    GP Usopp I guess you already know about him, and Luffy is only one way to go, yes."
OnePieceTC,3e226x,day2k,2,Tue Jul 21 10:35:54 2015 UTC,"I think kimono max CD is 13 while mirage is 8, which makes for near infinite stalling on Zephyr 😊"
OnePieceTC,3e226x,MrKoontar,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:29:35 2015 UTC,you wouldnt be able to use them both at once
OnePieceTC,3e226x,day2k,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:05:31 2015 UTC,"no, you can't, but Mirage @ 8, Alvida @ 9, and GP Usopp @ 10 gives you an average of 1 stall per 3 turns, which matches Zephyr's CD.  Otherwise, if you use it just once, Kimono has much better stats.  oh I just checked, Kimono has max 10 CD, which is pretty damn good too. Most people can't max Mirage/Alvida anyway, so it probably wouldn't matter"
OnePieceTC,3e226x,TiggerTheTiger1999,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:00:23 2015 UTC,Just remember to swipe left for Usopp evolution
OnePieceTC,3e2mqv,Mordecaibest,4,Tue Jul 21 14:08:24 2015 UTC,"ATK and HP hands down. RCV really does nothing.  RCV if anything should go on a support.  Generally Speaking HP/ATK is a must on every char. But to benefit most from HP/ATK/Recovery depends on the unit itself.  HP/ATK is constant RCV isnt (only when you use meat) so just think of it that way.  HP raises the cap on WB's Captain ability, albeit a small amount but it all adds up."
OnePieceTC,3e2mqv,LostTrooper,2,Tue Jul 21 14:40:52 2015 UTC,"I'd say it depends on what kind of units you often use. Units like Garp or Zorro which give 2x Atk & 2x HP benefit from +ATK/+HP. Supportive units (e.g. GPU), which don't play a big role in dealing damage would benefit more from RVC imo."

OnePieceTC,3e0ec9,soveliss_sunstar,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:41:45 2015 UTC,"From the first glance the microtransaction policy looks really similar to treasure cruise, but i dont know if rare recruits become mandatory in the future."
OnePieceTC,3e0ec9,andrekenny,2,Tue Jul 21 08:54:57 2015 UTC,"Rare recruit is mandatory, as only shitty characters drop from the missions. However, they are much more liberal with the dragon stones. Every stage gets you one for first clear, except for area 'ends' which get you more, and you can clear each stage 3 times (normal, hard, and z-hard). In addition to that you get stones every other total login bonus and FP recruit is not nearly as shitty as in TC (50/100 from guests and friends respectively and it doesn't just give you shit fodder). In this aspect it is more addictive than TC to me because I just want to get more rare pulls."
OnePieceTC,3e0ec9,MightGuy8Gates,4,Tue Jul 21 09:09:20 2015 UTC,"dragon ball dokkan battle, i don't really like it though"

OnePieceTC,3e0ec9,Jalidric,4,Tue Jul 21 07:17:49 2015 UTC,"Summer Vacation Luffy is character 659.  If you had a copy of every character released on the japanese version, including every stage of evolution, you would have 41 slots left over for miscellaneous storage (dupes, etc.).  Note that those 659 slots already include evo and booster materials.  Global has 200 slots for over 300 characters.  It includes ""fodder"" though."
OnePieceTC,3e0ec9,hkreeves,2,Tue Jul 21 00:52:37 2015 UTC,I though Bandai wanted me to spend gems? Why are they keeping global on 200? ._.
OnePieceTC,3e0ec9,bananafish707,3,Tue Jul 21 03:54:46 2015 UTC,"Well, for box size, once you spend it, it's always there. If they restrict your box size, you are forced to power up outside of skill up events, so you end up spending more gems to farm. However, they're walking a very fine line between this and pissing off all the pack rats."
OnePieceTC,3e0ec9,MightGuy8Gates,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:02:04 2015 UTC,This is a good hint that global may go a box increase silently as well. Hope is up!

OnePieceTC,3e2sqi,Kinnikufan,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:01:44 2015 UTC,Nice!  I'll hopefully get it once I get a few levels on my units.  It's a shame that I always lose to the Strawhats because of one mistimed perfect or bad orb luck.  I feel like I can burst Mihawk down in two turns if I can just make it to him.

OnePieceTC,3e2536,Chaoskel,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:10:26 2015 UTC,"According to this translation I believe it's:  Captain Ability: Cooldown reduced 1 turn at the start of the game, Shooters ATK x2   Special: Delay 2 turns and reduce enemy defence by half in those 2 turns  But wait for someone else to confirm this."
OnePieceTC,3e2536,etnanisor,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:19:24 2015 UTC,"what you stated is correct for special, captain ab is only shooters x2 tho, the picture has no mention of CD reduction"
OnePieceTC,3e2536,imket2,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:31:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah, i found it wierd but the translation from gamewith.jp says:   Deadly turn shortening + attack power doubled  Captain effect such thing as ""killer turn the 1 shortened, to double the attack of shooting type character"". The one turn shortening + power attributes of attack twice Aaron (the Sun) is a shooting version of.    Nonetheless what the picture says, it prevails."

Lol, I'd like to know what you'd consider a good team    Anyway, evolve to G3 and farm arlong and other story drops for now. Save your gems for box expansion and next sugofest and you should get a good set of units."
OnePieceTC,3e3yfy,Altair1124,2,Tue Jul 21 19:57:40 2015 UTC,"This, i don't really understand why you call it a bad team, rayleigh and g3 are god tier"
OnePieceTC,3e3yfy,andrekenny,-3,Tue Jul 21 20:01:24 2015 UTC,hahah i meant atm (since no g3 yet).. So no gems for farming yet? And thanks for the answer :D
OnePieceTC,3e3yfy,Altair1124,2,Tue Jul 21 20:02:31 2015 UTC,"Np. Nothing worth farming yet really. Plus your pirate level is low so you'd only get like 1 run on raid bosses per refill so not worth it.   You should be fine with what you got for now.  Just try to get atleast one copy of each raidboss, which may mean you need to farm laboon/vivi."
OnePieceTC,3e3yfy,Mihawkisbae,4,Tue Jul 21 21:16:16 2015 UTC,"Id say save rolls for sugo, whatever amount of gems you have come sugo spend like half getting new fellas and the other half use for stamina refill / potential box expansion in the future"
OnePieceTC,3e3yfy,bitereality,-1,Tue Jul 21 19:54:10 2015 UTC,Thank you for the answer.. Ill definitely take this into consideration :D
OnePieceTC,3e3yfy,MrKoontar,3,Tue Jul 21 19:57:19 2015 UTC,"youve got ray and a soon to be g3, its a great start. What to do with gems depend on if you are a p2p or f2p. For now, your gems really should only be used for sugos. Gem refills shouldnt start till at least 60 stamina, some wait till 75. It's just going to take time to fill out your box. But it will fill out with fortnight and raid reruns. Just in case, dont evolve your gp usopp and your mirage tempo nami. goodluck"
OnePieceTC,3e3yfy,PDPGINSU,-1,Tue Jul 21 19:59:39 2015 UTC,Hmm okay thanks for the answer! :)
OnePieceTC,3e3yfy,Ninjafro,2,Tue Jul 21 20:03:39 2015 UTC,"in terms of gem usage id highly recommend that once u get ur stamina up to 45 you use 2 gems a week at least to refill stamina for a turtle time (1 gem per turtle time) ull squeeze in 6 runs per 30 min period easy and thats 12 runs total for both times, ull easily level up your drake and ray altho i recommend evolving that luffy first"
OnePieceTC,3e3yfy,Ninjafro,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:05:15 2015 UTC,Okay! Thanks for the advice/answer :)
OnePieceTC,3e3yfy,PrimalOPTC,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:28:58 2015 UTC,"this. Beyond this, box expansion and save for sugofest."
OnePieceTC,3e1c0f,CorvusMell,3,Tue Jul 21 04:59:45 2015 UTC,"It really depends on your units and what fortnight it is, but I think if your an active player level 80-90ish is a good range.If your hardcore you could do it level 70ish."
OnePieceTC,3e1c0f,Adrales,2,Tue Jul 21 05:02:37 2015 UTC,Honestly kind of depends on what team. You could be P-level 100 and something and not be able to do the next upcoming island on Global if you do not have a good DEX team.
OnePieceTC,3e1c0f,troubled_bison,2,Tue Jul 21 05:13:37 2015 UTC,"It's kind of funny, there kind of is no p-lvl minimum but like Adrales said 70-90 is probably the time it would take. It's about playing for longer(obviously the two go hand-in-hand). It's not necessarily the lvl cuz you amass more characters from good pulls and farming. I was lvl ~50, got super lucky and got a laboon drop. I could clear Mihawk's 30 stam after only playing for 2 months. The fortnights are kind of like ""color"" challenges not really level challenges."
OnePieceTC,3e1c0f,bananafish707,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:15:52 2015 UTC,"I used to save up my gems for 30 stam at around 60/70ish. Now I've seen how stupid that was I'd recommend levelling to 80ish probably, although it does depend on luck of drops and the strength of your team."
OnePieceTC,3e1c0f,hilariousninja,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:37:43 2015 UTC,"I just broke 100 a few days ago and barely managed to do Kalifa 30 stam. First 30 stam fortnight I have done. Got super lucky with orbs, that's the only reason I go trough it."
OnePieceTC,3e1c0f,Freyzi,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:50:59 2015 UTC,"If you can beat the 15 stamina island by more than the skin of your teeth, then the 30 stamina is possible.  Some of them are really team dependent, so you might be able to easily beat one 30 stamina island and have trouble on another, seemingly easier one.  A big factor when I was starting out was whether the boss appeared with other units.  For instance, Krieg and Buggy were much harder for me than Arlong.  Of course, that's also because PSY units were pretty scarce when those islands popped up.    BTW, I just checked and the next three islands all have restrictions like Khalifa.  So unless you have solid DEX (against Lucci), INT (against Franky), or QCK (against Kraken) teams, those 30 stamina islands may be difficult to impossible."

OnePieceTC,3e316j,OPTCBail,2,Tue Jul 21 15:58:47 2015 UTC,"We got similar pirate level, and I'm about to hit my 150 days as well. Just a reminder, I'm sunny level 155 on your friend list. For Doffy, the team I'm going to run would be: double G3, MC (approximately 20 CD, hopefully with MC's return), Mihawk (already maxed just like you), max skilled GPU, and Perona. Not sure what team you are going to run, but since we got similar units, I'll just offer some of my advice.   First, G3 needs to be maxed. Against Doffy every bit of damage counts.  Second, MC's cooldown needs to be lowered as his special delivers about 300K damage against Doffy. I know it's all RNG but if you are not happy with the damage, you can log out and log back in, and you can try the special again. It'll give you a different damage. You got maxed hawk so that's all good.  Lastly, what's your GPU's CD? I made this comment in a different thread, but with maxed GPU's CD, you can activate his special on stage 4, and it'll be ready just in time against Doffy. This way your Mihawk's special will be ready right from the beginning against Doffy. With max skilled GPU and max skilled Mihawk, it's almost a guaranteed win against Doffy 60, granted if your MC's CD is somewhere around 20ish, it'll make your life much easier.  That's all I can recall for now. Nice box overall!"
OnePieceTC,3e316j,BankaiKenpachi,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:34:35 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the advice, my GP Usopps skill is maxed, but my MC skill is at 30 still. I'll definitely be working on pumping up Luffy and MC's level for Doffy. Not sure if I be able will get MC skill to 20 the next time he comes back, but it depends on how easily I can beat him."
OnePieceTC,3e316j,Ironman2131,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:14:07 2015 UTC,Not sure you really need to work on much for Doffy since you have G3 and other strong Force units.  Good box.
OnePieceTC,3e316j,Kinnikufan,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:08:49 2015 UTC,"Since I don't see Jozu, I think you'll need double G3 or double Monster Chopper leads with Monster Chopper/Arlong, Mihawk, Alvida, and GP Usopp if you want to farm Doflamingo."

With so many units, leveling focus is usually the issue. With the next few fortnights having type restriction, your g3 wont be getting as much use outside raids. So just prep type teams that are going to be used.

OnePieceTC,3e14ia,pikminolimar,2,Tue Jul 21 03:47:03 2015 UTC,Yes it is if you don't have an alvida. It mitigates damage by that percent and that will come handy with heavy hitting bosses (especially raid bosses)
OnePieceTC,3e14ia,RickyDonovan,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:49:08 2015 UTC,"And additionally to what ricky said, he is a heavy hitter with about 1200 attack himself too later on, but it takes some time since you have to evolve him 2 times and his 2nd evolution needs to be lvl99 to be evolved"

OnePieceTC,3e14ia,Tenji_,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:47:26 2015 UTC,Like Rick said nice if you don't have alvida. He's also one of the few characters with two evolutions so his stats are super freaking tanky. A good hitter. If you end up getting Law you and run a double Law team to burst but still fall back with his defense special.

The secondary level of satisfaction when I look at my box is definitely there and all, but it's when I actually play the game that I have the most fun, not when I look at my box. So I kind of view it as having paid to support the kind of playstyle that I personally enjoy, not paid to posses some kind of ""super duper awesome account.""  I personally think it isn't a good idea to say ""I put money into this game so now it is worth that X amount I put in."" That's how you start turning a game into a chore or some kind of duty.

OnePieceTC,3e2g4v,gianmk11,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:31:08 2015 UTC,"I'd say your PSY units are lacking quite a few levels and a heavy hitter (like Marco, Shanks, or Urouge).  I imagine 30-stamina won't be too difficult with Double Garp, but 40 seems like it'll be more problematic.  As for your every day teams, G3 and White Beard are excellent captains thanks to their lack of character restrictions, so you can build practically anything around them.  Might want to level your DEX and QCK units for future content (Lucci's island tonight, Kraken island in a month or two).  PSY and INT could use levels for the fortnights that restrict crews to those two types, but they're a little better off."

So far I maxed out or near-maxed out some of important units: GP Usopp, Mr.3, Coby (one more to go), Smoker (two more to go), and Mihawk.

OnePieceTC,3dyhyc,Im_Stormz,0,Mon Jul 20 16:24:22 2015 UTC,Them runs really grind my gears.
OnePieceTC,3dyhyc,Im_Stormz,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:07:34 2015 UTC,"yes very much so, if it was say 4 babies and an Elder there would be no complaints hahaha"
OnePieceTC,3dyhyc,Takinshoto,2,Mon Jul 20 18:22:37 2015 UTC,6 runs 4 elders cant complain ;)
OnePieceTC,3dyhyc,Dish4330,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:07:24 2015 UTC,nice! Hope you get the same or better on the next run!
OnePieceTC,3dyhyc,Dish4330,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:19:38 2015 UTC,"Managed to max out Mihawk's level from 94. Leveling up from 90 is seriously pain in the butt. Teens can only get you so far, only elders would cut it."
OnePieceTC,3dyhyc,CountFranklin,2,Mon Jul 20 16:05:47 2015 UTC,"hahaha i feel you on that one, my Mihawk is at 95 and I'm wondering if I should try to max him or feed the turtles to Law."
OnePieceTC,3dyhyc,bananafish707,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:20:19 2015 UTC,How do I know when turtle time is :(

OnePieceTC,3dyhyc,tadabola,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:12:17 2015 UTC,oh boy...ok find out what the 6th digit of your id is and use the turtle time calculator located on the sidebar -  http://cyung.github.io/optc/index.html  Enter it in the blank and it should tell you what your turtle times are.
OnePieceTC,3dyhyc,tadabola,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:15:14 2015 UTC,"Sorry still a little new to everything, thank you for helping me!  Also not sure if this is the right place to ask but is which team would be best for turtle time. http://m.imgur.com/XhoV7H6,LmQyN6n"
OnePieceTC,3dyhyc,MightGuy8Gates,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:40:58 2015 UTC,"No problem at all, I still have a lot to learn myself.  I believe right now the fastest team for turtles is the Psy team with Marco as the captain. I believe runner up is a Mihawk/Slasher team and then its the Marine team and lastly a G3 team."
OnePieceTC,3dyhyc,AlecarMagna,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:49:47 2015 UTC,"4 runs because the first fell while i was at work, 2 elders and 6 teenage, hoping for a few better at the midnight run when i can gem"
OnePieceTC,3dyhyc,xfizzle,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:34:48 2015 UTC,It'd be a lot better if I didn't have to switch from a Marco captain to Mihawk halfway through
OnePieceTC,3dyhyc,L-9,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:37:23 2015 UTC,"yea it sucks when I run out of Marco friends, but sometimes you can go back to the title screen and your friend list will sort of refresh bringing back some of your Marco friends."
OnePieceTC,3dyhyc,L-9,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:45:04 2015 UTC,Yea but that takes too much time for me
OnePieceTC,3dyhyc,OddSensation,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:46:54 2015 UTC,ah yea I can understand that.
OnePieceTC,3dyhyc,OddSensation,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:52:54 2015 UTC,"I typically sacrifice one run's worth of time to go back to title halfway through Turtle Time.  Refreshes a bunch of my Marco friends, but more importantly, refreshes me on their lists!  Mondays are always good days for FP."
OnePieceTC,3dyhyc,BenUniverse,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:52:51 2015 UTC,"I live on the west coast and got the 2pm & midnight times. Wish me luck. I'm curious to see if double-garp can work, but I'd rather just do my Mihawk one cuz I know that kills it in ~2 minutes."
OnePieceTC,3dyhyc,CoRMythe,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:44:23 2015 UTC,"yea that Midnight time, not my most favorite time hahaha.  Double Garp can work but I think it works best if he is high leveled. If anything its probably safer to stick with Mihawk"
OnePieceTC,3dyhyc,CoRMythe,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:55:44 2015 UTC,I tried a macro-garp thing. Still needed Fullbody but it's seems about as fast as mihawk.

OnePieceTC,3dyhyc,sabologia,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:04:15 2015 UTC,"6 runs, just my 90 stamina.   it was ok. 4 elders, thats cool.   now I'll maybe refill"
OnePieceTC,3dyhyc,TapToDie,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:57:28 2015 UTC,4 elders out of 6 runs is pretty good. Hope you get some more on that next Turtle Time!
OnePieceTC,3dyhyc,TapToDie,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:59:54 2015 UTC,"yeah, it was good. kinda was 4 runs with 4 babies and a elder but still counts"

OnePieceTC,3dyhyc,With_Hands_And_Paper,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:29:45 2015 UTC,14 elders in 17 runs. Used the teens to max my 3* Arlong and 4* Apoo to prep them for evolving. Saving the elders for post-evolution exp and maybe stash a few for Zephyr

OnePieceTC,3dyhyc,Jnty,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:10:50 2015 UTC,"oh man, that has happened to me so many times. I think a week or two ago I had 10mins before TT started and I went to get a coffee, while happily drinking my coffee and reviewing work emails I glance over the clock and it was 20mins into my turtle time. I was not very happy..."

OnePieceTC,3dyhyc,Ezrius,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:03:25 2015 UTC,"How do u guys get 16-17 runs per 30 minute session? The most I did was probably like 11-12.  I run a psy team with evolved shanks, garp, coby, Marco and sanji diable jambe for the elder turtle in the last round.. That's my fastest team so far. What team do u guys use?  And replying to this post, I ran 9 runs today and got 7 elder turtles. Not too bad:)"
OnePieceTC,3dyhyc,Kinnikufan,2,Tue Jul 21 04:05:41 2015 UTC,"This is the team I use for my turtle runs. On average i usually get about 17-18 runs per session, I have to gem of course. I use Fullbody because his specials cooldown is at 5.  http://i.imgur.com/g1I0AAs.jpg"
OnePieceTC,3dyhyc,Kinnikufan,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:19:51 2015 UTC,"I don't have any purples to max so TT wasn't much of a priority to me. My runs were 9am and 7pm, did around 10 first time (woke up a little late and missed 12 minutes) and 11 the second time (stopped caring about it, went back to playing Dokkan) got a total of 6 elders and 30some daimyos. Levelled my Urogue to level 40 and got my Paulie to 91."

OnePieceTC,3dyhyc,MinTef,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:15:04 2015 UTC,It was ok I guess. I woke up half way through the turtle time and tried to rush and get some runs in. I got enough to evolve Crocodile and Helmeppo at least but only a few elders.
OnePieceTC,3dyhyc,dondit,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:02:40 2015 UTC,Congrats on the evolve! Yea I hate the feeling when I oversleep for turtle time. There was a time I fell asleep 15 min before turtle time started and I woke up with about 5 minutes before it ended..i was not happy hahaha
OnePieceTC,3dyhyc,HeadBreaker,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:21:38 2015 UTC,Dont congratulate me yet I still have to get a rainbow dragon first. Hopefully God Coby will bless me and it won't take more than 1 or 2 runs to get.

OnePieceTC,3dzkwf,hkreeves,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:44:12 2015 UTC,He has a debuf for 3 turns anddefense for 4 if i remember right and an attack patern of 3 so he will hit u once for smth like 3.8k but its easy on first isle a double mihawk can clear it very easily without the need of gp usopp even that u can use it after he hits u once if u dont have enought burst to kill him then in the second isle its recomended to use a x2 atck and hp captain cause he poisons and there r mobs that silence before boss so u need some hp

OnePieceTC,3e1f2q,gallosh11,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:00:20 2015 UTC,Paulie was maxed and Kalifa is useless to me.  My beginning RR was Zoro.

Are you saving rainbow gems for Sugofest?

But I started out with a Mr. 5 and Vivi and didn't reroll.  Fortunately, Vivi allowed me to do everything up to this point (except for Hina). One of my friends quit this game after having shitty starter captains and not being able to do anything and I'd hate to see it happen to someone else.  At least now this person knows and can make an educated decision."

That means at 301 people will have +50 more stamina. Thats 170. Now so actually at lvl 321 you will have 180 stamina enough to run 3 doffys. Was 10 off

OnePieceTC,3e1mr5,MightGuy8Gates,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:15:25 2015 UTC,yeah that seems like a great idea or maybe even you just have to activate it sometime monday and once you activate it you have 1 hour or two activations each half an hour.

OnePieceTC,3e1mr5,bananafish707,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:55:20 2015 UTC,Usually I can just take breaks as appropriate to accomodate the TT but when I get a turtle time (this morning) at 8am when I start at 8am there's quite literally no leeway
OnePieceTC,3e1mr5,Curryriceandpeas,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:39:04 2015 UTC,I live on the West Coast and it's pretty unreasonable. I can't imagine Europeans or even just someone in New York getting both the turtle times.

OnePieceTC,3e1mr5,Kinnikufan,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:21:20 2015 UTC,Yep. The only times I can catch both is if the first one is close to noon and the second close to midnight. But usually the first is close to the evening and the second in the middle of the night or at the crack of dawn. Screw that.
OnePieceTC,3e1mr5,Kinnikufan,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:58:12 2015 UTC,Case in point: My times for the next two weeks are 21:00 and 07:00 and then 19:00 and 05:00.
OnePieceTC,3e1mr5,Mordecaibest,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:59:35 2015 UTC,"I see this a lot and maybe it's just my own whacked out sleep schedule in conjunction with my time zone (EST), but I make every turtle time except in the one-in-five instance where one is 3 AM for me. That being said, I do feel for everyone that can't make them. I read that their goal was to make sure different time zones could all make it to 1 of them a week, so why not at least make them a full hour and still twice a day?"

OnePieceTC,3e12ce,Ayk17,3,Tue Jul 21 03:27:44 2015 UTC,Any particular reason why you are using the Baratie over Merry?  Replace Blamenco with Kaku when he comes out in a day. Better color coverage + better special for a striker team.
OnePieceTC,3e12ce,troubled_bison,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:39:31 2015 UTC,"Im using baratie because it is still better than my merry as it doesnt give me atk boost yet, and thanks for the advice"
OnePieceTC,3e12ce,troubled_bison,2,Tue Jul 21 03:41:43 2015 UTC,Gotcha. You could also replace Smoker with Paulie- as the damage reducing utility spot is generally sufficient with Alvida alone.

OnePieceTC,3dzqo9,CorvusMell,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:08:52 2015 UTC,"Just play at your own pace. There'll always be people spending more money/time than yourself on this game. Luckily, raid bosses will return, and if you're not quite at a stage where you're able to farm them, perhaps you will be able to next time!  I'd focus on your Slasher team:   Evolve Mihawk, recruit Rob Lucci in the coming fortnight, bring Arlong, Shanks and Mr 3. Neat color coverage & handy delay from Mr 3. Depending on the colour of the enemies, you can switch in Zoro, Buggy, Kuro etc for type advantage.  Whenever Twin Capes is on 1/2 Stamina or 2x drop it wouldn't hurt to farm for a Laboon, just so that you'd be able to grab a copy of Monster Chopper and Garp should they return.  Other than that, just make sure to recruit all the new characters from each fortnight island as they come, and you can level them up at a later point! (it's a good thing you got Coby, Hina, Kalifa, Paulie etc)  Good luck!"
OnePieceTC,3dzqo9,Tvingman,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:58:15 2015 UTC,"Imo Turtle time every monday should be your main focus to level up your chars. Go with half stam to get cola and upgrade the merry. Mihawk will come again so dont fret. Try friend some mihawks with maxed special. I generally use g3 if not then mihawk 333462778 add me if u want. Get as many chars as u can so u have more options. But focus on your key chars first to build a base team so you should be able to tackle most enemies. I'd go slasher team. Mihawk, arlong, zoro, purple slasher (bon clay) useful for turn delay. Alvida if u need the 80% red or buggy for attack."

OnePieceTC,3dzqo9,Ironman2131,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:01:21 2015 UTC,I sold nami and usopp and the ones u mentioned i used for power up
OnePieceTC,3dzqo9,Erickj,2,Mon Jul 20 22:05:09 2015 UTC,Go farm for Usopp at stage one of syrup village. He is a top tier essential unit.
OnePieceTC,3dzqo9,Ironman2131,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:11:28 2015 UTC,"Honestly, given your pirate level, units (and those you've lost), and lack of a maxed box, I'd probably start your account over by rerolling next Sugo.  But failing that, go farm Usopp since he's basically a must to beat most tough bosses.  And level and evolve Mihawk since he's your best lead.  Towel Nami is your best current lead."
OnePieceTC,3dzqo9,RobertOConnor,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:21:28 2015 UTC,My boxcaption
OnePieceTC,3dzqo9,Ironman2131,2,Mon Jul 20 21:10:09 2015 UTC,"you don't have many units but you can build a slasher team with Mihawk, Zoro, Arlong, Shanks and Kuro (glasses guy, i think his name is kuro). Level them up and you will have a strong team. Also for a bit of diversity you can build a DEX team with Zoro as captain for x2 HP and x2 DEX ATK (surprisingly much better when you have x2 HP).  Learn the turtle times (which are right now so check) and you'll be able to level the fairly fast. Lastly save your gems for sugo to get more characters, not sure what you've been spending them on.  Maybe when its half stam try get usopp back as he is a must have unit for most raid bosses or sit and hope you get him in a pull."
OnePieceTC,3dzqo9,RobertOConnor,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:16:12 2015 UTC,I just pull when i can thats why i have not many gems
OnePieceTC,3dzqo9,BankaiKenpachi,2,Mon Jul 20 22:19:04 2015 UTC,"Stop doing that.  Use them first and foremost to increase box space.  You also might want to use gems during turtle time to get another four runs in.  You should really only pull during Sugos, and to be honest you have a lot more needs than the chance at a strong unit."
OnePieceTC,3dzqo9,MinTef,2,Mon Jul 20 22:23:32 2015 UTC,"Save them for sugofest, and im sure you,ve learnt now but only sell or feed away fodder pirates not unique characters."
OnePieceTC,3dzqo9,Ironman2131,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:28:58 2015 UTC,Do u think it would be a good idea to reroll next sugofest? Ive wasted many gems and as u have said dont have many good units
OnePieceTC,3dzqo9,MinTef,-1,Mon Jul 20 22:21:50 2015 UTC,"Hard to believe this is 150 days old account. Unevolved Mihawk at level 34 at 150 days... Also, where are your monster chopper and Garp? It could be that you are just too busy and you got other more important stuff to take care of. You just don't have time to play this game.   So, to catch up with the current content, obviously you don't want to miss turtles, even if you don't have gems for refill, you can calculate your stamina bar so that when you use up your last stamina, you get the level up and full stam again. Then wait 10 hours and run again. This way it would give you at least 12 runs, more than enough level up your characters quickly. Also, always prepare for the future fortnights or raid bosses. I'm not sure if you can clear Kahlifa 30 without MC, but it's kinda late anyway, so start preparing for Lucci. It seems like you got decent green units, so your No.1 priority should be evolving Mihawk ASAP. Lucci 30 is not to be taken lightly, so you got quite some work to do here."
OnePieceTC,3dzqo9,BankaiKenpachi,0,Mon Jul 20 23:50:48 2015 UTC,You have a really low level compared to how many days you have been playing it should be somewhere around plevel 200. Are you farming the 30 stamina isles? and leveling up the units appropriate for the next isle/raid?
OnePieceTC,3dzpcm,Zypherss,3,Mon Jul 20 20:59:43 2015 UTC,QooApp automatically gives me the option to install the update after I download.   Maybe try re-intalling QooApp if yours doesn't work that way.
OnePieceTC,3dzpcm,Kaladin77,0,Mon Jul 20 22:02:58 2015 UTC,I'm having the same issue. Need some serious help. I don't wanna go through account retrival process (again) >_<
OnePieceTC,3dzp1j,nightgt,3,Mon Jul 20 20:57:38 2015 UTC,"It is not the only one. Vivi has a 3, 4* book, v2 usopp has a 3* book, v1  strawhats have 3, 4* books. I mean who care about those unevolved books in most of the cases. But they do exist, and for not just Ace but a lot more units. So it is useless, but fair, because for any form and any version of a unit, there is a way to farm to level skill (either copies or skillbooks) in case anyone wants to."
OnePieceTC,3dzp1j,hkreeves,2,Mon Jul 20 21:08:31 2015 UTC,"Mostly true... But talking from the ignorance... 4* and 5* ace have different specials... So it makes sense to have 2 separate skillbooks. And from vivi, u can use 5* books to lvl up the 4* version (did not try it with the 3* but I think it will be similar)"
OnePieceTC,3dzp1j,Davidenko_7,3,Mon Jul 20 21:16:56 2015 UTC,"Right, the Vivi books from prior forms will work and carry through the same so I can see a relevance. As for the v2 Usopp books I would also have to cry useless because why would you ever want to waste time leveling up a skill that the evolved form does better.      As for Ace though, the special he has of 25x to one character, at best, can deal 13625 (multipliers unincluded). 5* Ace can hit a base max of 15300 to all characters. So other than a lower cooldown I don't see a reason to even want to collect this book. True, it is a different skill but WHY would you collect it? That's what I'm wondering :-P The other strawhat crew books are also useless for the lesser Luffy's, Zoro's etc (barring mirage Nami or his holiness GP Usopp). At least with those lower version you could control which one you were farming by it being limited to a certain stamina level. Since it's all in the same pool that is why I am venting about it. Since we can't avoid it by not doing lesser stam levels I just think it's pretty dirty to throw in such a useless book. At least Gin and Chopper have some slight relevance."
OnePieceTC,3dzp1j,kingofdabz,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:26:29 2015 UTC,"Maybe there will be a mission down the line that will require you to use specific characters such as unevolved versions of characters, so you'd wanna have their skills maxed just in case. For example I hear in the Japanese version there will be missions that require an unevolved Mihawk. And if it's him I'm sure there will be a lot more like that after him too"
OnePieceTC,3dzp1j,lookingforlaboons,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:37:17 2015 UTC,"Even if you'd specifically need an uneveolved Ace for a mission, I don't see how having his skill maxed would be necessary in any way."

OnePieceTC,3dzp1j,KSmoria,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:03:21 2015 UTC,"I made a mistake, Vivi 4 and 5 is the same, but 3* has a different skill. Her book comes on Kraken's island. Essentially, Baidai makes sure there is a way to mass farm (not just farm, like broggy and story luffy, you can have them dropped from story, but you can't mass farm them consistently, therefore they have books) either copies (like fortnight or raid characters) or books (like all RR only units) for ANY skill on ANY unique unit.   You consider ""better"" unit from a game point, what if someone considers from a personal point. Someone who just loves v2 Hammer Usopp but hates Dial Usopp. Baidai provides every possible book for the sake of completeness and fairness."
OnePieceTC,3dzp1j,xcwjxc,4,Tue Jul 21 01:03:12 2015 UTC,"They can be 4* Ace books, v1  Coby books, Hacchi books and whatnot. I don't give a damn, they are all fodder books in the end of the day."

OnePieceTC,3dzdc8,yorunomegami,2,Tue Jul 21 03:31:37 2015 UTC,"Used double MC, but didn't farm him because we hadn't kaku. With kaku you have one extra quick unit which makes it much easier since you can't stall 2 quick orbs for killer.   Team would be 2x killer, sanji, kaku, GP usopp an alvida/hina.   Adjust quick slots, priority: higher killer, subs with highest att.  Stall on penguin with usopp, use sanji vs seahorse stage. If alvida, tank one attack with her special, with hina use gp, kaku, hina."

Also i see you don't have mirage nami as her special nullify 1 INT attack.  As it is now, you don't stand a chance against Zephyr."
OnePieceTC,3e159j,BankaiKenpachi,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:32:03 2015 UTC,"When I look at the box, the first thing I tend to look at is the box space, then number of gems. But you can work on those later.   Now, obviously lack of GPU is going to hurt you, and do you farm him during Usopp village skill ups? That is what I did when I sold my Usopp early in the game and it took me weeks. As you know, GPU is perhaps the most important unit in the game, and you just have to get it done sooner or later.   As for your team against Zephyr, what team are you going to run? Garp needs to be evolved and leveled up to at least 50ish (I think), which is a lot of work, and time is running short till Zephyr arrives. Also, without GPU, it's going to be extremely tough because of Sogeking's high CD. You don't have Mirage Nami either. I'm sorry but I just failed to see a good team against Zephyr at the moment. All I see is unevolved Garp, Alvida, low-leveled Coby, Sogeking, this team is not good against Zephyr.   Lastly, why is your Mihawk still unevolved? Mihawk should be on the top of priority for everyone. What is your Mihawk's CD? if too high, then it won't cut it against Lucci."
OnePieceTC,3e159j,BlitzAction,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:32:26 2015 UTC,"Ok, well, if not Zephyr, can I at least beat Lucci, running double Zoro, with Zeff, Paulie,  Khalifa, and another unit(Smoker because his ATK is highest)?"
OnePieceTC,3e159j,bitereality,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:38:41 2015 UTC,"I thinki Lucci is doable: Double Zoro , Izo (better stats than Zeff, if evolved even better), Paulie, Khalifa and Mihawk/smoker."

My PSY units are not leveled enough so I got a friend to do it for me, he has an average of level 90 units. He used GP Usopp instead of V2 and Jozu instead of Coby.  Stages are pretty easy until Luffy's stage:   Activate GP, activate Garp twice, Kill Usopp (2turns) , then Nami (1 turns), then Sanji (3 turns), tank Zoro's attack with Jozu, tank  Luffy's attack with HP. Full heal with Marco. Kill Luffy, then Kill Zoro   Take pre-emptive, use GP Usopp. Kill Mihawk."

I already have my int slasher filled with helmepoo or buggy. Also Crocodile is gonna be farmable soon too. He envolves to another powerful int slasher

OnePieceTC,3dxyvr,wildcat2084,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:34:24 2015 UTC,Dex team like everyone says.. also Urogue and Garp since Zephyre might come soon...

OnePieceTC,3dxyvr,Ironman2131,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:38:38 2015 UTC,"Let's see.  Since you have got G3 all ready you should get him to a decent 40-50 for now. In the end it is more of a Marketing movement as a way of getting high G3 max friends than another thing. What you are interested in is getting heavy hitters for your team. Arlong would be STR, Mihawk or Zoro or Law could be for DEX (although I'd go with Mihawk since his special is op + he has very decent stats). I'd say you wait for Lucci for the QCK unit, Garp as PSY hitter (sine Urouge is involved) and Vista as INT hitter.  In the second place, it would be pretty interesting to evolve/ level Apoo & Law since they are going to be very useful for Lucci event isle and Ivankov (next Raid after Zephyr).  If would definitely prioritize Apoo & Law first and then Arlong/G3 since you will be using them for Doffy, raid after Ivankov, it's 2 months but u are going to need lot's of preparation."
OnePieceTC,3dxyvr,wagner_46,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:39:36 2015 UTC,I agree with wildcat.  Level/evolve law and apuu with a sure zoro mihawk and Paulie.  Good combo their  orb manipulation plus orb locking.  25 turn cool down but you'll be farming 30 stamina Lucci fortnight so it'll be okay.

OnePieceTC,3dwdwv,wildcat2084,4,Mon Jul 20 02:34:35 2015 UTC,"Since cotton candy is also release right now and you'll also get a title i plan to run the last stage at least enough times for the title.  I delay farming him till lucci's Isle is over since for me farming lucci's Isle has priority vs following fortnight isles due various reasons (Turtles, kaku, skillbooks...). With alubarna release i give Mr.1 a higher priority mainly because i've maxed/nearly maxed Mr.3, v2 helmeppo and vista and Mr.1 is the more stabile/useful slasherteam upgrade."

OnePieceTC,3dwdwv,Matainer,3,Mon Jul 20 06:01:07 2015 UTC,"Both Mr.1 Version seem to be useful, depending on enemies etc.  Mr. 1s attack is a little bit higher than his prisoner version (1042 vs 1011). And his splvl CD is lower (18 vs 22, which basically means you can almost always stall for Mr. 1s special - even when the special isn't leveled) while you will need a nearly maxed CD for the prisoner Version (17 is max).  The prisoners upside is that he buffs for 2 turns. This would often be overkill i assume. Therefore people seem to stick with the str one if they only need a one turn buff.  Another thing is that mr.1 will be released in roughly one month while we have to wait for the prisoner until impel down will be release, roughly 24weeks away."
OnePieceTC,3dwdwv,yorunomegami,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:51:08 2015 UTC,"hmm good question, its probably because the normal mr.1 has a lower cooldown... so if you only need one turn to burst someone down he is the better option"
OnePieceTC,3dwdwv,opoptc,3,Mon Jul 20 06:48:35 2015 UTC,I'll wait. Might as well use my stamina to try and level up Kaku's special while he's around since it's pretty good.

OnePieceTC,3dxmny,blackjack4494,3,Mon Jul 20 11:19:33 2015 UTC,From a logical standpoint I would say 2x drop rate is worth the extra stamina but then again I have seen a lot of advocates for farming during half stamina. I guess the lower the drop rates the more sense half stamina farming is.
OnePieceTC,3dxmny,gvon89,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:05:36 2015 UTC,Yeah I saw some of those nifty discussions. I guess the advantage of 1/2 Stamina is the bonus loot because double drop percentage got a limit of one item per stage/level
OnePieceTC,3dxmny,ShunTune,4,Mon Jul 20 21:51:19 2015 UTC,It doesn'T matter who you attack first. At the begin of the stage the game already selects which characters are going to be dropped.  Edit: I personally prefer 1/2 Stamina just because I value stamina more than drop rate since it takes so long on global to refill it.
OnePieceTC,3dxmny,opoptc,2,Mon Jul 20 11:25:11 2015 UTC,At first i only farmed at 1/2 stamina to get the most game time out of the limited stamina but nowadays i usually prefer 2X drop chance. 1/2 stamina has of course the bonus of some extra cola drops.
OnePieceTC,3dxmny,opoptc,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:38:21 2015 UTC,Okay that is interesting. I also see the point that you will get some more drops and that is why I also do farming on 1/2 stamina. Did you noticed a difference with double drop chance? :)
OnePieceTC,3dxmny,goatandcabbages,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:46:01 2015 UTC,"i actually got most story drops while 2X drop chance was active. But i dont think that i did enough runs for that to be significant. I just prefer it over 1/2 stamina because it doesnt take so much time, which was different from when I started the game."
OnePieceTC,3dxmny,goatandcabbages,2,Tue Jul 21 05:31:50 2015 UTC,"Here is a mathematical fact. Suppose the drop rate for a story character is 3%. Doing 1 run with dropx2 grants you a higher drop chance (6%) than 2 runs with staminax0.5 (5.91%). As you can see, the difference is negligible for small drop rates. Moreover, with staminax0.5 you get double pirate exp, beli, cola + other drops, thus overall it is better."
OnePieceTC,3dxmny,Heval1,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:19:05 2015 UTC,Uhm. I missed the part where you calculated in detail how to get to 5.91%?
OnePieceTC,3dxmny,hkreeves,2,Mon Jul 20 21:42:16 2015 UTC,"Drop rate is 3%, hence the failure rate is 97%. Now, with staminax0.5 you can do 2 runs instead of 1, hence you have two possibilities for the boss to drop. You can compute the probability of failing (= not dropping the boss) both times as 0.97x0.97=0.9409 since the runs are independent between themselves (the drops of the first run do not affect the drops of the second run). Hence 94.09% is the probability of the event ""boss did NOT drop both times"".  Instead, you want to compute the probability of the event ""boss dropped AT LEAST once in my two runs"" like this: 1 - 0.9409 = 0.0591 which is 5.91%."
OnePieceTC,3dxmny,tadabola,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:26:27 2015 UTC,It is assumed that drops are predetermined. So it doesn't matter which unit you attack first/last. I prefer farming 1/2 stamina. Gives you more xp than 2x drop.
OnePieceTC,3dxmny,hkreeves,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:29:32 2015 UTC,I agree to point two. To the first point I guess it is hard to say because if it is not predetermined there will be a check after each kill if drop gonna happen but when it does it will automatically deny all further checks. But if it is predetermined you are right it does not matter.
OnePieceTC,3dxmny,tadabola,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:48:52 2015 UTC,"Depend on the isle. For example, Drum 1/2stam is ALWAYS Monday and I am ALWAYS all in for turtle. So I only farm Drum on 2x."

As long as there isnt anything new being released you should be good. Like right now on global if MC were to be released this week we wouldnt know since we still have the 2.2 version update.

OnePieceTC,3dw48d,bandai_the_swagless,2,Mon Jul 20 00:51:19 2015 UTC,"From the event banner it looks like the skillbook itself will be the 6* version of whitebeard.   However, the way skill levelling works is that the fusion fodder needs to have the same skill name as the unit you're fusing into. Whitebeard has the same special name in both forms of his evolution so it shouldn't matter what evolution he's at when you're farming his skill books.  The drop rate for his books are apparently really low according to other JP players, and the amount of skillbooks needed to max him are all based on RNG.  Minimum amount of books needed is 8 since his cd goes from 25-17."
OnePieceTC,3dw48d,antonlabz,2,Mon Jul 20 01:58:58 2015 UTC,Psshhhh min amount of books you need is like 60 on x2 success. Trust me he will be a struggle to max his special.
OnePieceTC,3dw48d,S3xybaus,0,Mon Jul 20 20:26:59 2015 UTC,"So kraken isle drops Wb book with Wb face as in his 6. But that doesnt mean that the books will only effect wb if you evolve him. Both 5/6* wb can skill up from the book. The problem is his book has a 8%-10% chance of dropping. Now the average player and f2p probably has 60 stamina. That means you get to run 2 kraken runs. That means out of 10 runs you should at least get 1 wb book (that is like 5 gems for 1 book). If you are a p2p player and are at 90 stamina-120 stamina you can squeeze an extra run meaning it would take 3 gems roughly to get 1 wb. Now this is just the worst possible scenario. You might get lucky and drop 2 shoot maybe 3 wb books in a run. Lucky you! Stop playing this game and go win the lottery! But in all seriousness most people have seen what a drag it has been to farm blamenco/jozu books, the trend will continue with marco and then wb. But wb book will be harder to drop. Now people in this thread are saying the minimum amount of books to get wb is 8 which is true but thats highly unlikely....The success rate of skill up is 12.5% from what we can estimate. On x2 success its 25ish%. That means for every 4 books you might...just might get a skill up. So in truth you should save 32 wb at least to get his special max when its x2 success or 64 on normal days. Thats speaking numerically of course. Some people might get lucky and only use 20 books and max him. Some might use 200 and not be maxed. It really depends on RNG. So to be safe id say save at least 50-60wb books to use on x2 skill up. Its going to cost a lot of gems to max his special so be prepared to fork out at least for 2 packs of 85 gems if you aim to max his special (which you should because wb teams are really good and ridiculous op).   Tl;dr: Wb books effect both of his evolutions. Save at least 60 wb books to use on x2 success to be safe and max his special."
OnePieceTC,3dw48d,S3xybaus,-2,Mon Jul 20 20:51:13 2015 UTC,"I heard the drop rate is 8% which so really rare, the max cooldown is 17 so you'll need at least 8 books+ not sure if it will 6* books. Also it might take you multiple runs personally Im gonna be gemming like most people, I'd suggest you do to, cause its very unlikey you'd max him (the first time ) without gemming"

OnePieceTC,3dw48d,dowhatuwant2,0,Mon Jul 20 01:59:08 2015 UTC,OMG... 100 that only drop at a 8% rate? You have to do like 600+ runs at 30 stamina in order to get that. That is like 200 gems lol... You can't be serious right?
OnePieceTC,3dw48d,dowhatuwant2,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:08:42 2015 UTC,why would you use them when it's not a special up event though? I say get about 40 and save em for a special up event. You'll need to gem for them for sure though.
OnePieceTC,3dw48d,dowhatuwant2,-1,Mon Jul 20 04:11:40 2015 UTC,"But even with special rate up, you need 50. At the rate that people are talking, I don't think you can get 50 copies with 40 gems - correct me if I'm wrong though it seems almost impossible... Also, how many times in a year does these ""special rate ups"" happen? HTanks!"
OnePieceTC,3dw48d,dowhatuwant2,0,Mon Jul 20 04:22:32 2015 UTC,I managed to max out mihawk's special with 43 mihawks.
OnePieceTC,3dw48d,Reibus,0,Mon Jul 20 04:26:35 2015 UTC,I don't know Bro... Mihawk was a guarantee drop unlike this 6* whitebeard skillbook. And you probably had great luck to max using only 43 copies.
OnePieceTC,3dw48d,dowhatuwant2,0,Mon Jul 20 04:30:33 2015 UTC,"True, whitebeard skillbook will take ages but then the island will be up for 2 weeks unlike the mihawk raid....  Still you will need to gem if you want to max it, it is known."
OnePieceTC,3dw48d,Reibus,0,Mon Jul 20 04:37:51 2015 UTC,skill up chance is 25% during 2x event so on average so..  8 skill ups from 32 books  and at 8% on average youll need to do 400 runs  welp max wb might not be happening this time round

So you might want to rush through it, as it offers a LOT of exp, enough to propel you from lvl 1 to lvl 50 from the one-time only isle. It's pretty easy, lots of ppl were able to beat it with a newish account. So definitely try that."

OnePieceTC,3dwdpg,asscrasher,4,Mon Jul 20 12:32:52 2015 UTC,Go with JP  especially since you are already used to brave frontier JP .more content new version update really soon stamina fills up faster more characters etc.
OnePieceTC,3dwdpg,asscrasher,5,Mon Jul 20 02:30:16 2015 UTC,"Global is slower more methodical, mostly limited in your options. Some people like the pacing of global because it easy to max levels and specials when your options are limited and there is only one thing to do.  Japan version has more features ( more story mission, STAMINA REGENS TWICE AS FAST, bigger box capability, etc). The pacing is much faster and it is easier to level up and ramp yourself up. You almost ""have"" to start with a 6 star character though. Having a 6 star is a given so youll need to try to get one. The pace is much faster and youll feel like you are always playing catch up. The content is ""new"" as opposed to global where everything is lagging a few months.   Both have their pros and cons. I play both."

OnePieceTC,3dwdpg,WillCoke,3,Mon Jul 20 04:36:12 2015 UTC,"if you're already comfortable with various jp mobages, its a fairly known pattern that you get more and better rewards in the jp versions almost always.   better gacha pool selection so you don't need to play with weaker characters that get phased out (ie: G3 is obsolete in JP due to Log Luffy which trumps in every department without the weakness G3 has) free characters (gp usopp, tea nami, tropical robin, brain chopper has been given out in the past 3 months.  and summer luffy is being given out this week) better tap animation (the english tap animation words are much longer and could be difficult to visualise the convergence) you get gift codes giveaway fairly often (no codes in global) vjump gift codes every month (requires vjump purchase) faster stam regen rankings to earn stones cotton candies guerrilla (not available in global, this is huge, the earlier you start farming this, the better)   despite the overwhelming pros of the jp version, my personal advice is play closer to whichever region you're associated with because, there are turtle guerillas that you need to do for exp fodder which are a big part of the game.  it would suck if you have to wake up at 3am at nights to farm them.  jp guerilla times are always fixed (but randomed) from 9am, 12pm, 3pm, 6pm, 9pm JST."

So they had me to go through the ticket process 3x, asking me to ensure that i wont use emulators and wont use multiple accounts  on the same device lol. You should be fine though if u can fill in all the data in the ticket."
OnePieceTC,3du287,bk_market,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:15:12 2015 UTC,took me a week. They keep sending small emails everyday to ensure that I wont multiple account and only to use it on my main device. It was really weird.
OnePieceTC,3du287,lamby130,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:35:44 2015 UTC,I had a Droid4X account fresh I use for barrel breaking. The password expired and the account was brand new and all I knew was it had Luffy and limited information. The guy to my surprise actually found it for me but said he couldn't do anything as playing One Piece on the Droid4X goes against the ToS. However if I agreed to play on iOs or Android he could assist me further.
OnePieceTC,3dtxdr,Mordecaibest,16,Sun Jul 19 12:50:45 2015 UTC,"Hands down Wb is stronger then Ray and the strongest OPTC character we have gotten to date. His x3 damage is really good and overall will do more damage then most Ray teams. Also dont forget Wb special that is essential like mihawks and means if you run x2 wb thats 51% hp remaining off enemy boss. Pair that up by adding a mihawk sub thats 66% hp off any boss i believe. He is just so good and godly. The only real 2 problems wb has are the following: The first 1-3 times you run a stage you will need to get a feel for the stage and know when to stall for captain ability/specials which can be boring (or you can look online with gamewith or youtube which shows each fortnight/raidboss on how to beat them with wb and what subs) the 2nd problem is you definetly need to max wb special. That is easier said then done since it only appears on kraken fortnight and is really really rare to get. But if you manage to get his special max along with other peoples wb and a sub mihawk every single upcoming content will become a joke. You will sweep through the game no problem. Doffy who? Bb where?? Fuck you akoji! Granted wb teams will take you a little more planning they are hands down the best team we have in this game in terms of damage and utility. Now Ray is beautiful and he can clear a lot of the content like wb the only problem is it will take a little more effort since you wont be blasting through the boss like wb. Dont get me wrong i love Ray and his attack animation is tied for best with X drake and his dino form. Ray is meant more as a reroll or quickly clearing easier fornights/story mode. Wb on the other hand is meant more for mass farming the big guys like akoji, doffy, and bb. Especially once we get the moby dick. Wb players that max his special and ship will have less of a hard time stalling for wb captain ability as well as making this game too easy.   Tl;dr: Wb is really op, if you're looking to max his special he will be a beast. Ray is sexy, enough said."

OnePieceTC,3dtxdr,raistlyn,6,Mon Jul 20 05:36:57 2015 UTC,"Well, if we're talking strictly global, then for right now (and especially after Kraken isle) WB is the better legend at least as far as bosses are concerned.  Rayleigh is by far the best for fortnights/story as others have said, and is very capable of clearing all the bosses... some of them are just slower clears than WB.  Overall though, I'm very happy that I have Rayleigh over WB.  As /u/troubled_bison said though, while the advantage of Ray/WB is being able to clear all the content... it's usually easier and faster to use a fully specialized team if you can.  For JP, Whitebeard is falling pretty steadily out of first place, but bandai is almost specifically making anti-WB bosses -_-."

OnePieceTC,3dtxdr,porncookie,2,Mon Jul 20 12:53:48 2015 UTC,"Prefer Rayleigh. He's more time/effort efficient for storyline/fortnight farming.   As for raidbosses, I wouldn't use either. I'd just use a specialized team for it, so it doesn't even really matter. (i.e. A full marco burst team is better than either WB or Ray for Zephyr.)"

Whitebeard is your man  If you like an OP character that is easy to use, but will probably have a tad harder time on some boss compared to WB. Rayleigh is probably your answer.   A few days ago i had to choose an account with WB and an acocunt with Rayleigh, can only keep one.. .I ended up choosing Rayleigh."
OnePieceTC,3dtxdr,TiggerTheTiger1999,2,Mon Jul 20 08:30:44 2015 UTC,"higher Ceiling --- Whitebeard  most convenient --- Rayleigh  Ray is generally quicker, easier and requires less prep to complete harder stages with, hes a really strong plug and play captain and thats why so many people enjoy playing with him, hes pretty brainless and your doing enough damage to blow away all but a few bosses in the entire game (jpn), though when your doing things like the aokiji 60 stam, thats where WB shines, Ray cannot do that and aside form SW Shanks im not sure anyone else can so WB shows how powerful he really is on this stage. hes truly the most powerful captain in the game, thats undebatable. Its just whether you want a character thats mindless and generally accepted to be the more fun to play, or the one that garauntees your able to clear any content in the game so far providing you have the correct support units, at the expense of time, prep and potentially fun when doing the fortnights and things, generally hes just to much of a ball ache to use on those since there are so many captains capable of clearing them theres no reason to use him."
OnePieceTC,3dtxdr,_Madara_,3,Sun Jul 19 13:23:21 2015 UTC,"Ray cannot do that and aside form SW Shanks im not sure anyone else can    Rayleigh, G3 and Mihawk can beat 60 Aokiji."

OnePieceTC,3dtnke,IOHA,1 point,Sun Jul 19 10:54:22 2015 UTC,its actually a great combo for dex slashers vs blue raid bosses with slasher boat since all 3 are slashers and you have spots left for 2x mihawk and doffy   i never calc'd the dmg but it should be compareable
OnePieceTC,3dtnke,d3th__king,2,Sun Jul 19 11:20:20 2015 UTC,Didn't think about that haha...doffy seems like something I can't get...
OnePieceTC,3dtnke,Flexgroin,3,Sun Jul 19 12:02:15 2015 UTC,I have both Law and Apoo but I'm not sure I'll ever use the combo aside from against Lucci and Ivankov. Monocolourd teams just don't seem viable compared to multicolored. Especially with regards to monocolour STR/DEX/QCK. Do monocoloured teams get used at all in the Japanese version?
OnePieceTC,3dtnke,With_Hands_And_Paper,2,Sun Jul 19 10:32:34 2015 UTC,"monocoloured teams are mostly used for raid bosses, where the stages before the boss are usually relatively easy  Psy and Int teams can in principle be used anywhere because they have no type weakness!"
OnePieceTC,3dtnke,bitereality,1 point,Sun Jul 19 10:35:50 2015 UTC,A Law/Apoo combo is probably the best team for Enel Raid boss too.

OnePieceTC,3dtnke,bitereality,0,Sun Jul 19 17:18:47 2015 UTC,I think he means people used both of them in slasher teams against enel for full dex orbs. So the usual doffy/mihawk lead with apoo in for orb manipulation paired with law.
OnePieceTC,3dtnke,S3xybaus,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:28:57 2015 UTC,"yes, i get that, but still havent seen any slasher teams with law and apoo.

Seen shooter team with apoo though"

OnePieceTC,3dtnke,bitereality,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:04:13 2015 UTC,Yup np. You also dont need maxed out units. Just lower lvl cd i ran the same team on jp just make sure doffy/mihawk special are within 20. Rest doesnt matter too much.

OnePieceTC,3dtnke,d3th__king,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:13:45 2015 UTC,"I think no one really answered your question, so well, in the first place you have to take into consideration that it doesn't really matter Izo has a low cooldown since you need 18 turns to activate Khalifa. Therefore Law + Apoo wins from this point of view doing to combo in 12 turns.  In the other hand, we have the stats. RCV are very similar, however Law & Apoo have higher HP & ATK. Which again makes this couple better.  Thus, Law/ Apoo combo > Izo/ Khalifa  Other DEX combo's not worth mentioning since these two are stronger."
OnePieceTC,3dtnke,burnedcoconut,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:00:42 2015 UTC,Apu and law is better. Both unit have not offence power then izo/khalifa and law captain give him a helping hand there also but the real difference is that you can fire apu/law combo every 12 turn while the khalifa/izo is only every 18 turn. Not to mention apu will do damage with his special also. Its just better

OnePieceTC,3du09z,drblackjack,2,Sun Jul 19 13:43:02 2015 UTC,"I'm surprised no one's mentioned this, but far more important than evolving your units (except Usopp, for sure you want crab evolution Usopp, he'll make a huge difference) is learning how to construct a team with proper synergy:  http://onepiece-treasurecruise.com/en/recommended-crew-lineups/"
OnePieceTC,3du09z,grouchylady,3,Sun Jul 19 21:48:15 2015 UTC,Pro tip - evolve your Usopp using a crab. If you don't you'll regret not having the most useful special in the game.

OnePieceTC,3du09z,IOHA,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:40:05 2015 UTC,"Realistically, the easiest place to get evolution materials is during the extra island weeklies.  If you can't wait a week then try to get evo materials via story islands but the process will be dragged out bigtime."
OnePieceTC,3dsri6,blueeddie,4,Sun Jul 19 02:37:16 2015 UTC,"Congrats!  I am quite jealous, but then I've only spent $20 on this game so far, so there's that."
OnePieceTC,3dsri6,Kinnikufan,4,Sun Jul 19 02:57:06 2015 UTC,And you have G3 and Marco! Definitely two of my favorite characters I'd like to have if I only spend $20.
OnePieceTC,3dsri6,Kinnikufan,2,Sun Jul 19 03:00:03 2015 UTC,"G3 was just all kinds of ridiculous when I pulled him.  The V2 Strawhats were just introduced and I only had 3 pulls for their initial 24-hour rate-up (pseudo-Sugofest, I guess).  Wound up getting 2 Rock Soup Sanjis and Balloon Luffy (only one I wanted).  I was ecstatic and evolved him as soon as Logue Town came out.  Marco was during first Sugofest before I spent the $20.  I wanted White Beard, Marco, and Jozu, so I dropped some dough and got Jozu, which was pretty great.  And I just got Urouge from last Sugo, so I'm pretty happy that the only Supernova I got is my favorite.  I've been lucky with getting the characters I really like at least."
OnePieceTC,3dsri6,Kinnikufan,2,Sun Jul 19 03:11:51 2015 UTC,"Guess what. My first pull for this account was Gin, the second being Smoker. I had no intentions of rerolling because the only way I knew how to back then was to delete the app and reinstall it.   My second sugofest gave me two WBs, that's when I started wanting to spend more on this game. Got my G3 during the first sugofest with free gems just like you did :D"
OnePieceTC,3dsri6,eldaras,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:24:45 2015 UTC,"Nice!  I probably will spend again, but not until the Strong World characters come to Global.  My goal for now is to pull a few times every Sugofest and hoard the rest of my gems for raid boss/fortnight refills and the two SW Sugos."
OnePieceTC,3dsri6,KSmoria,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:29:07 2015 UTC,"Same. I'm very satisfied for now, that's why I refused to keep chasing after Rayleigh. Probably only going to pull again when there a lot more new characters, not just a batch."
OnePieceTC,3dsri6,kaosctrl510,2,Sun Jul 19 03:34:40 2015 UTC,"Wow, very good box! Even if you had spent some money... I remember some ppl who spend quite a lot of money and are still missing some core characters (like G3)"
OnePieceTC,3dsri6,Gyissan,1 point,Sun Jul 19 11:19:20 2015 UTC,No rayleigh? You didn't spend enough money obviously
OnePieceTC,3dsri6,yorunomegami,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:48:27 2015 UTC,"Haha hence the 'missing silvers'. I stopped pulling after getting the final supernova, didn't think Rayleigh was possible. Spent ~$55 this sugofest on top of the 115gems I saved.   All those turtle times I've missed (or not gemmed) for the supernovas. I gotta say, it was worth it."
OnePieceTC,3dsri6,dowhatuwant2,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:53:44 2015 UTC,"Amazing box dude! All I'm missing for RR units are Blamenco, Capone, and Rayleigh! And you know... the story characters I'm to lazy to farm! XD"
OnePieceTC,3dsri6,dowhatuwant2,0,Sun Jul 19 03:12:03 2015 UTC,"Haha nice! Same here, I'm too lazy to farm for chessmarimo, the dinosaurs, and kurewa."
OnePieceTC,3dsri6,dowhatuwant2,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:38:47 2015 UTC,How much money did you spend on this game?
OnePieceTC,3dsri6,dowhatuwant2,2,Sun Jul 19 04:17:33 2015 UTC,"$100-$150. Too much, at the same time, never enough."
OnePieceTC,3dsri6,dowhatuwant2,2,Sun Jul 19 04:33:10 2015 UTC,Looks like you we're super lucky.  Are you trying to keep up your log? Or are you now focussing on leveling these units as your pool is enough to beat almost everything.
OnePieceTC,3dsri6,kivsakura,2,Sun Jul 19 05:50:58 2015 UTC,"Nah it would be ridiculous to try to fill my log, especially for supernovas that I pulled with 5 stars. There are a lot of characters that I don't really care about."
OnePieceTC,3dsri6,BankaiKenpachi,1 point,Sun Jul 19 11:40:45 2015 UTC,"Honestly I think you are a liar if you're telling people you only spent that much. I have spent triple that much and am only missing blamenco, xdrake and rayleigh despite being quite lucky compared to others with RR. No way did you get all those RR characters with that much spent in my opinion."
OnePieceTC,3dsri6,kaosctrl510,2,Mon Jul 20 01:41:30 2015 UTC,"$150 is 2x $55 + $20 x 2 = 85x2 + 30x2= 230gems, 130days = 130 gems, 5gems x 12 islands + another ~20(extra gems for stages) = 80gems, 14 events + 15-16 extra islands(including yellow turtles etc) =20gems. Another 10-20gems handed out by bandai for events and bugs.   Total = 380 not including gems from codes and login extras, which will easily put me over 400 gems. At least 80 pulls spent only on two sugofests with WBx2 and g3 within the first 12 pulls which also got me other V2 strawhats. 68 pulls is enough to get 15 characters (5 wb commanders, 10 supernovas) when 3/5 pulls during sugofests are gold posters, which gives me at least 40 gold posters. There's really not much left to pull when you have the wb commanders and super novas. Choppers are evolved from silver choppers.   You can believe it or not, I don't really care. Spending $450 on this mobile game is fucking retarded in my opinion.   Edit: btw, there are only 26 RR-only characters in my list."
OnePieceTC,3dsri6,BankaiKenpachi,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:01:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah don't care, no way you got all those characters without buying more than that. Notice that your picture shows you still have 100 gems left so yeah you're a fucking liar."
OnePieceTC,3dsri6,Jalidric,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:20:15 2015 UTC,I can see how bitter you are since you spent fucking $400 lol.
OnePieceTC,3dtyqv,ZsuOPTC,4,Sun Jul 19 13:08:57 2015 UTC,"Do you have Mr 3? I found it way more effective to take out Helmeppo and bring Mr 3. Smoker and Tashigi will end up hitting you, yes, but I pop Alvida for Smokers sole hit and it's no issue. More importantly, each use of Mr 3 wins you a turn for your other cooldowns to charge, and if you spend extra time at Smoker you'll easily have GP for both Baroque and Straw Hats.    How do I make a table    Lv 99 Gear 3 (Friend) Lv 68 Gear 3   Lv 56 Alvida Lv 88 Mihawk (max special)   Lv 50 GP Usopp (cd 13) Lv 70 Mr 3 (cd 13)    Rundown:  Stage 12 (Buggy) - The lvl 99 Gear 3 special  Stage 15 (Arlong) - Mr 3 (luxury)  Stage 16 (Baroque Works) - GP Usopp and Mihawk* (Mihawk is not needed per say, but you might as well use him if he'll be up again for SH's)  Stage 17 (Smoker) - With no Helmeppo, you'll have to pop Alvida on turn 3 when they both attack (sometimes you'll have killed Tashigi on this turn, depending on orbs). Clean up Smoker when captain is unchained  Stage 18 (Dragon) - My own Luffy's special clears the crabs  Stage 19 (Straw Hats) - GP Usopp and Mihawk (If you didn't stall as long as possible on previous stages, Mihawk might be a turn away from charging, if this is an issue just don't use him on Baroque)  Stage 20 (Mihawk) - Mr 3. Also, Alvida should be up to grant you a third turn, but I didn't need this. (does this Mihawk do some crazy special if you leave him under 20%? Will Alvida suffice in that scenario?)  Sorry for wall of text, and good luck!"
OnePieceTC,3dtyqv,Tvingman,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:44:10 2015 UTC,Agreed. Mr. 3 is a lot more useful than helmeppo.  I basically use the same team and very similar strategy. Only difference is that i use ussop for arlong and mr.3 for baroques agents.
OnePieceTC,3dtyqv,pdamdl,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:42:23 2015 UTC,"Ya, I did the same until I noticed that Usopp was charged way before the Straw Hats. At the end of the day I wanted more leeway on the Baroque agents in case Mr 5 had a 1 turn timer I suppose."
OnePieceTC,3dtyqv,Tvingman,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:52:05 2015 UTC,"Did you have Merry at Max level for this? I've tried a strat similar to this but I feel like I'm short on damage, and my Merry has been stuck at level 9 for 3 months. However I had been trying Jozu over Mr. 3, so I'll give that a chance soon."
OnePieceTC,3dtyqv,PlayerTw0,2,Mon Jul 20 00:14:18 2015 UTC,"I have a max Merry, yeah. What levels are you short on damage for? I'm guessing Luffy on stage 19 (since no Quick unit)?  I ran Jozu initially, until I noticed I didn't need him to kill the red units. Best of luck!"
OnePieceTC,3dtyqv,Tvingman,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:55:42 2015 UTC,"So I just beat Mihawk's training island! I'm lucky enough to have a max CD Mr. 3, so I was able to use him 3 times (Arlong, Dragon, and Mihawk) which really helped with my survivability. Thanks for the advice!  edit: also, is it cool if I add you as a friend? I also pulled Kidd during sugo, and it'll be nice to have Kidd friends around when I evolve him here soon."
OnePieceTC,3dtyqv,PlayerTw0,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:55:50 2015 UTC,"Congratulations, I'm jealous of the max Mr 3!  Sure, go for it! Not that I'll be able to field my Kidd much as long as fortnights require mono-color teams, but might as well start collecting Kidd friends."
OnePieceTC,3dtyqv,Tvingman,2,Mon Jul 20 02:16:28 2015 UTC,"I was able to clear it using the following team, with a high level Gear 3 friend and maxed Going Merry:  http://imgur.com/AMh7C4B  The only maxed special was Mr.3's. Usopp cooldown was 15, and I managed to use it 2 times.  That's how I used the different specials:   Buggy: Gear 3 special to kill the mobs. Arlong: Mr. 3 special. Start attacking Arlong. Baroque Works: Usopp Special. If you have a GP Usopp with 15 turns cooldown like me, it's crucial that you don't kill Miss Valentine until the last turn before she hits you. Smoker: Helmeppo special. Kill Tashigi within one turn and take care of Smoker before he hits you, but again, don't kill him until the last turn.   You have to be very precise with your perfects from now on:   Dragon: Gear 3 special to kill the crabs.  Mugiwaras: Usopp special and Mihawk special. Mihawk: Mr. 3 special.   I failed many times because I missed some crucial perfects, but if you're good at it, it's doable.  Good luck on your attempts!"
OnePieceTC,3dtyqv,nil-illa,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:56:05 2015 UTC,so close
OnePieceTC,3dtyqv,antonlabz,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:09:52 2015 UTC,"Personally, I find Whitebeard to be the easiest to use once you can control his HP threshold. I would say Mihawk teams are the next in line to be able to clear the forest, but only if you have max skilled GP. Then G3.  With Whitebeard and G3 teams you don't need a max skilled GP.  EDIT: On second thought, I'm not sure if you need max skilled GP on a G3 team, but you definitely don't need him to be max skilled on a WB team."

OnePieceTC,3dtyqv,kanon85,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:50:01 2015 UTC,"How is a setup that requires you to hit all perfects easier than ones who don't? I'm not saying G3 doesn't work, I used it myself, but it's stressful >_<"
OnePieceTC,3dtyqv,rayleighisop1,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:45:22 2015 UTC,"I did it with double g3, gp, alvida, helmoppo, mihawk.    Only one with a special close to max was gp.  Think that's the only one that matters. In terms of character levels alvida was 60 and the others 70 - 80  Order of specials.   Buggy: gp special, arlong: alvida, baroque works: gp, dragon: g3, straw hat: gp and mihawk.   Don't remember if I used alvida again for mihawk I probably did but I could then kill him in two hits."

OnePieceTC,3dth7w,yorunomegami,2,Sun Jul 19 08:12:19 2015 UTC,Well ideally the best striker team has whitebeard in it and his max cd is 18 turns. Aokiji max cd is 18 turns so paulie having 17 cd is ok.
OnePieceTC,3dth7w,Slithicer,2,Sun Jul 19 08:18:03 2015 UTC,Thanks for confirming my thoughts. So i can safe my gems for lucci's Isle.
OnePieceTC,3dth7w,PrimalOPTC,1 point,Sun Jul 19 08:20:08 2015 UTC,"why would it be necessary to gem in luccis isle? o,o just curious"
OnePieceTC,3dth7w,syngin-ps4,2,Sun Jul 19 08:24:49 2015 UTC,"Marco skillbooks, kaku's special. Blue turtles as at least my quick units are not really leveled at all. Necessary might be the wrong word. It would just make more sence to me gemming lucci than kalifa since i don't own jozu or blamenco  and have an appropriate CD for kalifa's and paulie's special ."
OnePieceTC,3dth7w,PrimalOPTC,1 point,Sun Jul 19 08:36:44 2015 UTC,So hungry for those blue turtles.
OnePieceTC,3dth7w,opoptc,1 point,Sun Jul 19 08:38:57 2015 UTC,Plus i've no need in gemming Frankie (my psy team is more than decent) Kraken (don't own wb) or hogback (int team is also nice). I also stopped pulling since bad luck streaks and i find gemming stamina more efficient. Besides that i'm still trying to reach plvl201 before Doffy.  Maybe i find even more reasons for gemming lucci.  Edit: grammar
OnePieceTC,3dth7w,PrimalOPTC,1 point,Sun Jul 19 08:53:02 2015 UTC,ok i see. thank u for letting me know. i had also a lot of bad luck pulling.. no wb/g3/rayleigh so far and i dont expect them to drop for me. plus mihawk costed me 93 copies and 40 gems to max his special. rng is against me at the moment. spending my gems for TT and waiting for SW Ace to appear. nevertheless iam going to spend about 20-30€ every sugo to just have some pulls and maybe be lucky. i mean there is the slightest chance isnt it :P?
OnePieceTC,3dth7w,ShwimmingAway,1 point,Sun Jul 19 09:05:28 2015 UTC,wow you really got bad luck! Heads up soon you will get a peak in the lucky region of the spectrum :)
OnePieceTC,3dth7w,jet_10,1 point,Sun Jul 19 09:27:58 2015 UTC,hopefully. thanks for cheering me up :3
OnePieceTC,3dth7w,PrimalOPTC,1 point,Sun Jul 19 10:04:36 2015 UTC,"Frankie works really well with a garp team imo, with his special you can at least give all of the strongest units Psy orbs. Plus he's pretty strong and has a pretty decent captains skill if you don't have shanks and need more wiggle room on the damage front than you get with Marco."
OnePieceTC,3dth7w,HonoraryAustrlian,2,Sun Jul 19 19:35:49 2015 UTC,"Of all my Paulies, I haven't gotten any skill ups, but like that guy mentioned, most teams, when stalling for specials, have a max limit of around 17-18, so you should be fine.   The only exceptions are those that have low enough max CD that can be used twice during a battle."
OnePieceTC,3dth7w,xAndrenx,1 point,Sun Jul 19 08:42:11 2015 UTC,have him on 18. hopefully can get one more lv up to be even with mihawks skill cd ;/ also willing to gem a few times when island is going to end

OnePieceTC,3dth7w,HonoraryAustrlian,2,Sun Jul 19 16:33:12 2015 UTC,I fought Django in Hina's fortnight and he dropped...a skillbook. :(
OnePieceTC,3dth7w,xAndrenx,0,Sun Jul 19 23:47:23 2015 UTC,"Huh, did he drop that same skill book every time? I was under the impression the secret bosses have a 100% chance of dropping, but maybe that's my own confirmation bias.  Or maybe Django drops the skill book because he's Kuro's secret boss as well? Not sure, I'll try to look into this more."
OnePieceTC,3dth7w,Azzac96,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:58:57 2015 UTC,still the odds of running fortnight exclusively since its release minus like a day or 2 and only seeing him one time  but good to know that
OnePieceTC,3dtnzc,PrimalOPTC,4,Sun Jul 19 10:16:57 2015 UTC,I did it yesterday with lvl 10 merry and with this team:  Max Lvl Max CD Mihawk (friend) Lvl 66 CD lvl 13 Mihawk   Lvl 72 Arlong  Lvl 50 Mr. 3 (max CD)  Lvl 47 Helm V2  Lvl 50 Golden Pound Usopp  Not my video but its a good guide :)  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3TwKsg2GKE
OnePieceTC,3dtnzc,Hathsin,1 point,Sun Jul 19 10:36:05 2015 UTC,I run the same team but havent been able to clear the island yet. The furthest i've gotten to was stage 19. Maybe perhaps because of my level 9 merry.
OnePieceTC,3dtnzc,blindisland,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:53:30 2015 UTC,I tried it several times with lvl 9 Merry as well and didnt make it.  I think lvl 10 Merry is a must have for this team.
OnePieceTC,3dtnzc,Hathsin,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:16:39 2015 UTC,Max merry is mandatory for Mihawk teams due to low dmg out (2.5) and only one strength units. U should focus on lvling merry anyways before using coffin boat
OnePieceTC,3dtnzc,kys916,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:31:31 2015 UTC,"Ya, that makes a big difference"
OnePieceTC,3dtnzc,TiggerTheTiger1999,4,Sun Jul 19 15:24:33 2015 UTC,I made the video posted by Hathsin. The higher the special for Mihawk and Usopp the less you stall on the crab stage. If you had a max usopp 0 need to stall on crabs. Just finish rainbow dragon off in 6 turns. You can use double Mihawk specials on Arlong as long as ur Mihawk special is 23 or less
OnePieceTC,3dtnzc,kys916,1 point,Sun Jul 19 11:53:28 2015 UTC,"Ah shit, so I could've used both Mihawks there (mine has a CD of 20).   Well anyways, thanks for the video mate."
OnePieceTC,3dtnzc,Hathsin,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:18:26 2015 UTC,Ive tried various possible teams and always fail. Most time I am able to get to stage 19 but then its just over for me. Seen Mihawk once but can not think about beating him with no GP Ussop ready which i need for stage 19.. ;/
OnePieceTC,3dtnzc,enri1706,1 point,Sun Jul 19 10:18:02 2015 UTC,Theres a video on youtube with double mihawk mr3 helmeppo arlong gp usopp try and see it u have all the characters
OnePieceTC,3dtnzc,frrntc,1 point,Sun Jul 19 10:25:33 2015 UTC,hell yeah great thanks. i will give it a go. even though this gp usopp is probably maxed
OnePieceTC,3dtnzc,rafilfc,1 point,Sun Jul 19 10:28:45 2015 UTC,I did it with this Team you should use the CDs like in the YouTube Video.  On the stage with Mr 3 I recommend killing green->purple->red->blue. Mr 3 will lock you if you if you do not kill him in time. And you can tank one hit from the red mob so don't worry about that.  Trick is having matching orbs on arlong and mihawks at the strawhat stage so you can kill ussop and zoro first turn.  Other than that you have to hit perfects consistently and not have bad orb luck at stage 19 20... Might take some tries but it is possible.
OnePieceTC,3dtnzc,Bartolomeo-san,2,Sun Jul 19 10:39:11 2015 UTC,used the same team but had to try multiple times until i got matching orbs on arlong and mihawks. getting those orbs is vital nless you have max characters
OnePieceTC,3dtnzc,IOHA,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:51:51 2015 UTC,if i had g3 i think it wouldnt be a problem at all. the lack of having him is getting me into trouble. i even have merry maxed and still no success. well i just try the f2p from enri1706 right now.
OnePieceTC,3dtnzc,xTimelined,1 point,Sun Jul 19 10:30:44 2015 UTC,You should definetly be able to clear Mihawk 0 Stamina Island with: Mihawk (MAX Special friend captain) ; Mihawk Captain ; Arlong ; GP Usopp ; Mr3 and Helmeppo
OnePieceTC,3drs03,xTimelined,7,Sat Jul 18 20:53:56 2015 UTC,"Depends on the island. On an island that has a stage where there is high defence minions right before the boss stage then Vista may be better than crocodile because you could orb shuffle in the previous stages. However overall Crocodile would be better because he can combo with his team. An example of bursting with slashers involving crocodile : Activate dual mihawk special, then activate crocodile special to change his orb to int and all others to random, use doffy to switch orbs between two characters to get good orbs, then use mr 1 to boost attack."
OnePieceTC,3drs03,Slithicer,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:40:45 2015 UTC,Mr 1 any good? I'd think arlong takes the red slasher spot.
OnePieceTC,3drs03,Shatteredofdawn,4,Sun Jul 19 00:59:43 2015 UTC,Sometimes special defines a unit. Mr1 is the Robin for slasher team (1.25x). And I am not obsessed with a complete rainbow team. I can bring both Mr1 and Arlong as long as the boss is not blue.
OnePieceTC,3drs03,hkreeves,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:07:16 2015 UTC,Gotcha thank you!
OnePieceTC,3drs03,Shatteredofdawn,0,Sun Jul 19 01:08:15 2015 UTC,How about Kohza replacing Mr. 1?
OnePieceTC,3drs03,Donkeyshounen,2,Sun Jul 19 09:58:46 2015 UTC,"Kohza will surely replace Mr.1. He gives a 1.5x boost instead of 1.25x, and he is QCK, meaning that you will be able to use Arlong, while with Mr.1 you had to use Lucci at most."
OnePieceTC,3drs03,Bac0,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:10:37 2015 UTC,Specials are a lot better than stats in my opinion. Mr 1 gives extra damage to your entire team and also you reduce damage by 50% for a turn so it gives you an extra turn. Also mr 1 has good enough stats himself.
OnePieceTC,3drs03,Slithicer,7,Sun Jul 19 01:59:03 2015 UTC,you can make an all slasher INT team with vista lead and mihawk boat. It would work well on psy raidbosses I think
OnePieceTC,3drs03,tadabola,5,Sat Jul 18 21:33:43 2015 UTC,"Yep, just replace Mr.3/Helmeppo with Crocodile.  https://youtu.be/KJsvVEqDkyA  Double Vista with coffin boat gives your entire team 6x ATK and HP."
OnePieceTC,3drs03,lookingforlaboons,7,Sat Jul 18 21:45:32 2015 UTC,both
OnePieceTC,3drs03,asscrasher,4,Sat Jul 18 21:23:23 2015 UTC,He would be very situational... Cocodile might be worth it if you are going to use a team of INT slashers against a raid boss. Right now the only Heart raid bosses are Heracles'n and Garp...Those can both be done with Dual Mihawk teams.
OnePieceTC,3drs03,koryuken,5,Sat Jul 18 21:20:04 2015 UTC,"I think you're probably fine with Vista.  Maybe some time down the line you'll see a need for Crocodile instead, but until then I wouldn't worry about it too much."
OnePieceTC,3drs03,Kinnikufan,2,Sat Jul 18 21:24:23 2015 UTC,"I feel that people overthink about the efficiency of leveling and splitting boosters. I mean, this is a super cool Sir Crocodile, 5* Shichibukai, with wonderful stats and special. If you love this character, just get him as strong as possible. That simple."
OnePieceTC,3drs03,hkreeves,2,Sat Jul 18 22:15:20 2015 UTC,Well crocodile also has higher atk than vista if I recall correctly.
OnePieceTC,3drs03,Bac0,6,Sat Jul 18 20:56:27 2015 UTC,I think by like 50 yea.
OnePieceTC,3drs03,Adrales,2,Sat Jul 18 20:59:03 2015 UTC,"I'd say Crocodile is better due to his special overall the stats are quite even one has more HP one has more attack not by to much though, if you have Maxed Vista already theres no need for you to rush into crocodile just focus on other stuff They both are quit similar."
OnePieceTC,3drs03,IOHA,2,Sat Jul 18 21:22:06 2015 UTC,you either use both vs a psy fortnight/raidboss or use whichever you got
OnePieceTC,3drs03,WillCoke,0,Sat Jul 18 21:54:18 2015 UTC,"Depends on the rest of your team really, if you're running a full INT team then use Vista; If you're using slashers of different types( EX. Zoro, Lucci, Arlong) then use Crocodile. Crocodile also has better HP and Atk."

OnePieceTC,3dsl9a,Kinnikufan,2,Sun Jul 19 02:04:34 2015 UTC,What Garp team are you running? And what's your tactic?
OnePieceTC,3dsl9a,KamiLuka,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:26:21 2015 UTC,"Double Garp, Marco, Coby, Mr. 2, GP Usopp.  Pretty much save specials for the Strawhats and try to get rid of them as quickly as possible.  I haven't tried this team as much as G3, mostly because the Baroque Works agents are harder to deal with while using that team."
OnePieceTC,3dsl9a,Kinnikufan,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:30:16 2015 UTC,"Ya I always get stuck at the baroque works agents. I might try out the Garp team you said, since it seems promising. Thanks"
OnePieceTC,3dsl9a,KamiLuka,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:44:13 2015 UTC,"No problem.  I almost always get to the Strawhats with all of my specials except Usopp (because of Arlong I wind up stalling there) and Marco (because of the accumulated damage).  Then I lose to them because I want to save specials for Mihawk.  Oh, and just tried G3 again, got Luffy down to a quarter of his health and he dropped me.  I hate that I would have won if I hadn't missed my first perfect against Sanji, but my levels are at a point where every hit needs to be perfect for that battle.  Makes me nervous about what Mihawk is like."
OnePieceTC,3dsl9a,Kinnikufan,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:53:16 2015 UTC,"Bummer man. G3 is probably your best bet, I don't have one, but his usefulness seems to be ridiculous. Good luck."

OnePieceTC,3dsl9a,Kinnikufan,1 point,Sun Jul 19 09:06:04 2015 UTC,You can do it with a Mihawk slasher team. The only max cd you need is your friend's Mihawk
OnePieceTC,3dsl9a,Card_Breaker,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:19:36 2015 UTC,"I probably can, but the levels aren't high enough yet. G3 is likely to get me there quicker since I'm already coming close to making it to Mihawk himself using that team."

OnePieceTC,3dtb8d,jurgeon,1 point,Sun Jul 19 06:33:33 2015 UTC,"I'd focus on Mihawk, when he's evolved he give 2.5x attack to slasher with a friend captain that's 6.25, Mihawk slasher teams are one the best teams in the game to date, they can clear nearly anything, plus mihawk has the best special in the game (debatable), on top of that you have many great slashers (Kuro Zoro Law Vista Hawkins, even buggy and tashgia are alright) Lucci is coming on Tuesday I'd defiantly pick him up if you can he's the best QCK slasher in the game, I have WB G3 and many other good leaders, but I can tell you I use Mihawk teams more then any other, its the most versatile, fun and easy Imo. Good Luck!"
OnePieceTC,3dtb8d,Adrales,1 point,Sun Jul 19 06:38:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah Mihawk is your most versatile option!  Also your dex options seem to be quite strong, even though you cant guarantee a full dex orb board without izo or apu which are RR only units.  Your third really strong team option is a vista team because you have Nico Robin. I dont see bp chopper or broggy to ensure at least 3 int orbs with buggy so i suggest to farm either broggy or evolve the chopper you get after drum island into brain point."
OnePieceTC,3dtb8d,opoptc,2,Sun Jul 19 08:08:21 2015 UTC,"he has izo and apuu, 2nd image. he's also got tnami.  Slasher teams are great, but Not sure about focusing on mihawk at the moment. Yes, he's a great slasher lead but the next few fortnights will be type based so slasher teams wont be getting much use. I havent used my slasher team since khali started, except in mihawk training forest and this is how it'll be for the next few fortnights. He's a great unit though for dex, just not sure you can get him law apuu ready for lucci in time.  Pretty much   Dont evolve your mirage tempo nami and dont evolve your gp usopp.  you've got a complete int team with tnami captain, robin and vista, but as opoptc said evolve the chopper you get to brain point chopper. But i wouldnt focus on your int team at the moment, you should focus on your dex.  Dex really should be your focus. you have law and apuu so just level them up evolve and you'll be having an easy time with lucci isle, you can pick out of the rest of your dex team for fillers. asura smoker paulie. For now i'd ignore izo and khalifa since you already have the apuu law combo for orb manipulation. You can still keep levl khali special though if you choose to but since your turtles are limited i'd focus on law and apuu   I see you dont have garp, but you still have the harder to get components of a psy burst team, marco, hammer usopp which will evolve to impact and mr 2. Once you get garp on rerun you'll have a complete psy team. marco books will be in this upcoming isle  Try to get 1 zeph. Your int team is already complete so you dont really need zeph but he will rival the highest int stats (vista) when he comes. A little less attack damage but a lot more health.   Maybe dont level tashigi. youve got kuro capone already, and soon lucci  as well as kaku wil be added with ivankov so you can couple a quick team out of that. tashigi stats are just kind of low.  Think thats it, goodluck and get 2nd opinion"

Either way, according to the release schedule it wasn't that much later between them (only a week apart between Christmas Sugofest and Shichibukai Sugofest). My best educated guess is two months before next Sugofest with new units. Don't count me on it."
OnePieceTC,3drqvb,animusdx,5,Sat Jul 18 20:43:24 2015 UTC,"Save them for an event called Sugofest - it's a 24 hour only event that happens AROUND once a month, randomly - it will be announced a few days prior."

Sugofest is a 24 hour event that comes about once a month where the chance for some great units is increased and you can get sugofest exclusive 6 star characters(Whitebeard and Rayleigh) Just remember this: every rare recruit you do outside of sugo is one less chance at a 6 star character.

OnePieceTC,3dro3m,bitereality,3,Sat Jul 18 21:13:50 2015 UTC,"I think as far as Sugofests go we actually are following their schedule.  I recall the Sugofest before this recent one had a lot of people debating whether we'd be getting Supernovas batch 2 and Rayleigh then or the V2 Strawhats + White Beard batch 1 rate-up and it wound up being the latter with Supernovas and Rayleigh being the most recent one.  That was also the order for Japan, so if that's the case, we could get White Beard batch 1 and Supernovas batch 2 rate-up next (in August) and Shichibukai (with Boa Hancock) in the following (in September)."

OnePieceTC,3dqz92,Sjuen,3,Sat Jul 18 16:52:15 2015 UTC,"It is the best place to farm cola, because it is the cheaptest 10 stage chapter (6 stam) so you get the most chances for the least stamina!  Drop chance should be the same everywhere (except fortnight islands because of skillbook drops)  You can also get cola by playing the friend game (I think silver chests have the highest cola chance?)  And starting with ver. 2.2 there will be the Den Den Mushis which also have a chance to drop cola  I think those are all the possible ways to get Cola"
OnePieceTC,3dqz92,opoptc,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:11:08 2015 UTC,yeah like this guy said Arlong Park final chapter is a great place to farm on 1/2 stamina. Mostly any island that is 1/2 stamina for the day and preferably if it has 10 chapters. but only on 1/2 stamina days cause them its to expensive to farm on any other day.

OnePieceTC,3dsdjj,AnthonyH318,3,Sun Jul 19 00:14:41 2015 UTC,"the no continue condition only applies on the 0 stamina Mihawk island, not his Raid, you can blow as many as you want on his raid.   Raid is only available for 24 hours every so often (depending on when bandai choose to play nice) and drops Mihawk. 0 Stamina island is available permanently and has a ""no continue restriction"" for this reason, your not limited on how many attempts you can have either by time or stamina so they make it so you NEED to have a team capable of beating it legit and its probably the hardest island we've had to face on global so far imo. it doesn't drop Mihawk though, it only drops his ship."
OnePieceTC,3dsdjj,Azzac96,3,Sun Jul 19 00:35:46 2015 UTC,The Mihawk Raid Island does allow the use of gems. However the Mihawk Training Island does not allow gems.

OnePieceTC,3dsdjj,ShwimmingAway,2,Sun Jul 19 00:22:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah that is what I was talking about, I'll edit it"
OnePieceTC,3dsdjj,NickOPTC,3,Sun Jul 19 00:46:57 2015 UTC,"It goes against the for-profit model of the game.  Bandai wants players to use 5 or so fruits to acquire raid bosses when they're only around for 24 hours.  The gem restriction on the training forest seems to run somewhat counter to that model. But as it's always there and the ship potentially offers farm more utility than bosses like Ivankov or Duval for like a single gem.  A gem you spent to get the coffin boat or the mobu dick is potentially many gems you won't spend on raid bosses. They're really forcing you to play more of the rest of the game to acquire better units, lower cool downs and and higher levels.  Might seem like it doesn't make sense to others, but I think I understand no continue for the 0 stamina islands, and don't think we'll see that applies very often for timed events.  Because that would only force you to spend on stamina, but that's already the most efficient way to spend."

OnePieceTC,3dsl89,Youngphantom1,2,Sun Jul 19 01:45:27 2015 UTC,"Probably August 18th.  Pure guess, but it's usually the middle of the month and usually the start of a new type rate-up.  We'll know closer to the actual date, but don't expect it any time soon."
OnePieceTC,3drx7z,fredyyy02,2,Sat Jul 18 21:40:34 2015 UTC,Gear 3 is a much better captain than v2 Nami.   Baloon Luffy + Killer sounds like a great starting account. Killer has one of the highest attacks in the game once he is fully leveled up.
OnePieceTC,3drx7z,Kaladin77,2,Sat Jul 18 21:45:52 2015 UTC,"I'd go with Balloon luffy/G3( G3 is one of the best units in the game can clear almost everything if you learn how to hit perfects) and Vivi, Practice hitting perfects at the 0 stamina island you'll get the hang out it eventually also turn your sound off it helps alot,and if you get Vivi it would be great, you could farm raid bosses in the future like mihawk MC garp when they come along with some other stuff."
OnePieceTC,3drx7z,Adrales,2,Sat Jul 18 21:47:08 2015 UTC,You can't farm raid bosses with a Vivi team.Unless by farm you mean get 10 copies in 10 hours...  I would go for the Balloon + Killer.
OnePieceTC,3drx7z,koryuken,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:49:38 2015 UTC,"Sorry, I meant obtain, but it is possible to farm I farmed about 24 copies of garp with Vivi zoro, Only reason situation I'd go killer is if he's 5* if he's 4* he's gonna have to much to evolve along with Balloon luffy,plus there very similar captains and with Vivi he could obtain new units right when they come and just focus on evolving his Luffy rather then trying to make a team for it."
OnePieceTC,3drx7z,Adrales,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:53:49 2015 UTC,"Vivi is farm-able though, Killer and Balloon Luffy are not..."
OnePieceTC,3drx7z,koryuken,0,Sat Jul 18 22:11:30 2015 UTC,"Yea, that's is a great point, but it might take multiply runs to get her, It too me at least 150 runs+ to get her, it was really brutal, lol and if he farms her, he has to evolve her 2 times from 3 star which is hell he could use all that exp on his G3."

OnePieceTC,3dqu4l,saiyanslayer190,3,Sat Jul 18 15:55:45 2015 UTC,dont know but a way to test it would be to build the team you have now put that in and see if its correct
OnePieceTC,3dqu4l,Reibus,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:12:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah,  you are right but i don't have that team complete,  maybe someone in the sub has it,  that would be awesome."
OnePieceTC,3dqu4l,Reibus,2,Sat Jul 18 16:16:01 2015 UTC,well its a little odd the results   in game my MC team has 6450  and the calculator says 6453   so id say it was  correct
OnePieceTC,3dqu4l,_Madara_,3,Sat Jul 18 16:28:20 2015 UTC,Try putting merry at level 1 then at level 10 and see if there's a difference in HP. shrug
OnePieceTC,3dqu4l,_Madara_,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:21:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah, right.  At level 1 it says 7035 hp. Is the bonus 32 hp at max merry?"
OnePieceTC,3dqu4l,bitereality,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:31:47 2015 UTC,"The HP will work but sadly not the stalling, to get 17 turns you need max skill GP Usopp. You can get the HP you want if you use the Navy Ship instead of Merry (the damage will still be enough, barely), but I don't see many F2P people maxing that thing before Doffy either.  The F2P slasher team also needs max Coffin Ship ..."
OnePieceTC,3dqu4l,erdbeer_sahne,3,Sat Jul 18 16:36:50 2015 UTC,"the stalling will work, 2 extra turns on the big red axe guy, 2 extra turns on the stage before doffy, you'll get mihawk special on 2nd turn with doffy after he attacks, so when his attack turn says 1. He does need max special soge king for this to work but doesnt need max skill gp usopp for the run he's planning.  EDIT soge king can get away with 17 turns"
OnePieceTC,3dqu4l,bitereality,2,Sat Jul 18 19:43:23 2015 UTC,I tested my team's HP in the training forest and the HP was only off by 1 from the calculator.  Therefore I think that the bonus HP of the Merry are added to the captain and thus suffer the reduced HP from captain ability.
OnePieceTC,3dqu4l,yorunomegami,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:15:05 2015 UTC,Thanks man! I thought so.
OnePieceTC,3dqu4l,yorunomegami,2,Sat Jul 18 18:11:01 2015 UTC,"If you do and manage to hit that health threshold, couple things you'll need to note  With Soge king usopp, you'll need to get his special to 17 turns  You wont be able to take a single hit to stall though the run i think you are planning you wont need to.  The lobster stage seems to have terrible auto targeting, taking a hit from that or anywhere else ends your run  You'll need mc chopper special at 20 or less, and the damage from them to be at least 250k  Not sure how much orb luck will come into play.  Your other option is to use g3 friend, which will solve your hp crisis, but with the loss of 1 chopper special. though i think it should be fine since the run i am using for comparison used his mihawk special after 1 turn of damage due to mistake in stalling, losing 263k of possible damage and still beat doffy, whereas yours will be up 1 turn earlier netting the full 720k damage on the bottom doffy  Goodluck. any comments appreciated in case i made mistakes"
OnePieceTC,3dqu4l,yorunomegami,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:31:02 2015 UTC,Thank you for your post! Helps really out.
OnePieceTC,3dqu4l,burnedcoconut,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:04:16 2015 UTC,"Another thing you can consider is the fact that perona's isle should be released roughly one week before Doffy's appearance.  That would make your time much more viable, since her HP won't get reduced by MC and she reduces 90% instead of 80% dmg. It would be even easier if you have GP instead of Sogeking because you could stall on stage 4 and trigger GP again vs Doffy."
OnePieceTC,3dqu4l,burnedcoconut,1 point,Sun Jul 19 06:57:35 2015 UTC,"You are right,  but i don't think perona will be released before doflamingo."
OnePieceTC,3dqu4l,SkillerBehindYou,1 point,Sun Jul 19 08:00:17 2015 UTC,If i counted correctly we will have one week of perona's Isle before Doffy. But i unterstand that one week isn't something we can be sure of.  Edit: autocorrection correction

OnePieceTC,3drzg1,WillCoke,2,Sat Jul 18 22:10:52 2015 UTC,I would say wait til you have more cost to have an efficient team. I am by no means an expert on this sort of thing but I would say the latest you should wait to evolve Newgate is when the Doflamingo raid goes live.
OnePieceTC,3drzg1,WillCoke,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:04:43 2015 UTC,"Till Doffy?, isn't that a long time, any certain target to get to ? ( cost ) that would be eaiser ?"
OnePieceTC,3drzg1,Adrales,2,Sat Jul 18 22:09:01 2015 UTC,"Like what Adrales said, I would wait til your cost is 130-140 but it really depends on what units you want to use with Whitebeard.( I really only said Doffy at the latest because Whitebeard will be VERY useful on that raid.)"

I would wait until you have a cost of around 140.  You can check if you could use all of your heavy hitters, remember that the 6* WB has a cost of 55.  In the meantime, try to get a BP Chopper or any of the meat provider units, as they are usually a must for a WB team."

OnePieceTC,3dr7q2,pamboys09,7,Sat Jul 18 17:58:53 2015 UTC,"Honestly WB is a horrible unit to have when you first start out. He will take forever to level, his cost is too high, and his capt ability to too difficult to manage."

For me I don't think I have any friends left from my early days since they couldn't keep up with my pace. I sent friend requests by choosing guests with my similar level when I do training forest or simply found friends from this subreddit. Sometimes I delete friends who have similar pirate level as mine but their captains are not high-leveled, which is practically useless to me. For example, my G3 is maxed, but a lot of my friends' G3 was somewhere around 50-60, those are the first ones I deleted when I got maxed G3 friends. This is why I tried to get my most useful captains maxed so that I could be useful to myself and my friends.

If you want to save the candy for future units without clogging your character box, you could give them to some fodder unit, then feed it to the unit you want to boost once you get it. A smart approach would be having one fodder for each type of candy.  For example, if you have no need for a Vivi, you could give all the recovery candy to a 2* fodder to save them until you get raid boss Enel (or a lucky Boa Hancock pull)."

If not, then no pressing need to give her the RCV.     On JP I feed all my RCV to Boa, and if you dont have Boa, then I think Enel is a great alternative. For global...not sure. I don't give her +HP because I want her special to be able to heal from 1HP -> 70%. Do NOT feed RCV to slashers, especially Mihawk and Doffy, since coffin boat gives you negative RCV, so you'll likely never be healing with orbs.  For +HP, I would go with WB (to increase the HP cap at 30%) or Mihawk (and Doffy in future). Doffy captain gives 2x HP, and coffin boat gives slashers 1.5x HP, so +HP goes a long way for the two big slashers.  ATK can go to any 6* (except maybe Sengoku), your often-used last-hitter unit (somebody in the high 1300-1500 ATK range), or your often-used, high-multiplier captain with good ATK."

OnePieceTC,3dnbvx,day2k,-2,Sat Jul 18 23:40:48 2015 UTC,"Extra RCV into Vivi is a must for players who don't have many of the extremely powerful units as Laboon/LionsSong Zoro teams are their most reliable means of fighting raid bosses like Mihawk, to GET the more powerful units. Higher RCV on Vivi means being able to have a better team while still being within the 50% healing zone necessary for Laboon teams, and a better chance of staying at Full HP for LS Zoro teams.  Even if you aren't using her in your own raid runs, there are hundreds of newer players who could benefit greatly from a Vivi during battle events during your away time, so I recommend that any player fortunate enough to have a Vivi spend as much RCV Cotton Candy as you can give to her - if not for your sake, then for others less fortunate!"
OnePieceTC,3dnbvx,gargoss,5,Fri Jul 17 23:48:55 2015 UTC,I think you would very much regret putting your RCV into her.
OnePieceTC,3dnbvx,MinTef,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:40:07 2015 UTC,"Yea I must say, using laboon to get raid bosses is a one time deal and not worth the candies.

OnePieceTC,3dnbvx,day2k,3,Sat Jul 18 04:04:19 2015 UTC,Since it costs more beli the more candy you feed to a character can you do this.... Feed like 20 candy to a fodder and do that for like 5 fodder a totalling 100 candy. I assume it'd be cheaper even though it takes up 5 spaces.. Also could I then feed all 5 to a character and give that character +100 in candy? Or will it only transfer the candies of one character

OnePieceTC,3dnbvx,PannocchiaBoom,4,Sat Jul 18 09:07:50 2015 UTC,"I think you are wrong about that. Arlong will almost always be your last hitter, so you want his attack to be as high as possible by giving all your attack candy on him. A support char like perona or usopp will be   your first hitter and their attack stat doesn't really matter.  I think guys like Mihawk, G3, Arlong, Vista etc benefit more from candy. RCV candy would be best used on vivi or some PSY with high rcv (coby, garp?)"
OnePieceTC,3dnbvx,KSmoria,0,Fri Jul 17 18:46:01 2015 UTC,Yea but I don't see Arlong being so useful in Raid Bosses and Fortnights since I feel like his special isn't noteworthy. I feel like people would prefer a more useful special with lower attack than him.

OnePieceTC,3dnbvx,kingofdabz,3,Fri Jul 17 23:09:48 2015 UTC,"Yup, he's the last hitter in my G3 team, my slasher team, and even my STR team, so boosting his attack would be so worth it"
OnePieceTC,3dnbvx,hkreeves,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:50:24 2015 UTC,There is the young Arlong
OnePieceTC,3dnbvx,hkreeves,2,Fri Jul 17 21:52:15 2015 UTC,that's a totally different character....
OnePieceTC,3dnbvx,KSmoria,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:02:35 2015 UTC,I was referring to your last sentence.
OnePieceTC,3dnbvx,Tenji_,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:11:39 2015 UTC,"Who cares about his special. He has the highest attack in the game. But still, I would put candy on some leader you use much like mihawk, g3 or wb."
OnePieceTC,3dnbvx,gizmodeck,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:03:45 2015 UTC,"That is not true, Monster Chopper for example, has more attack than Arlong"
OnePieceTC,3dnbvx,day2k,2,Mon Jul 20 06:30:32 2015 UTC,"quick questions, for the ""200 max overall"" limit, that isn't character specific right? so once u use 200 pieces of cotton candy total, any cotton candy after that will be useless?  second question, ""You may only apply 100 Cotton Candy upgrades maximum.""  - is that 100 pieces or 100 total stat increase? for example since, since hp goes up by 5, does that mean you can only feed 20 pieces of HP candy to a character or is it 100 pieces?"
OnePieceTC,3dnbvx,monkey0999,5,Fri Jul 17 23:02:01 2015 UTC,"each character can have a maximum of +200 combined  it's not account based  the limit is based on the total +number, not total pieces (the golden candy gives +1 to each stat)"
OnePieceTC,3dnbvx,sitolawrence,0,Fri Jul 17 23:17:48 2015 UTC,"If I want to max my WB HP and ATK, i should only put HP and ATK candy of 100 each.   can I put 100 Golden Candy and 100 HP candy? This could max my WB HP"
OnePieceTC,3dnbvx,DrDiagramm,2,Sun Jul 19 00:18:04 2015 UTC,What if I put into a crab?
OnePieceTC,3dnbvx,RNYeezus,3,Sat Jul 18 00:52:42 2015 UTC,the crab will have diabetes
OnePieceTC,3dnbvx,Slithicer,1 point,Sat Jul 18 12:26:14 2015 UTC,I'm thinking of putting them into fodder unit and feeding all my attack into doffy maxed with cotton candy gives 1700 base attack and he's used as often as mihawk.  And then after that maybe lucci
OnePieceTC,3dnbvx,Foofs123,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:11:41 2015 UTC,"I would feed cotton candy to units I consider the core of the team, and units that I would use the most, like Mihawk or Robin. Doffy seems like a good character to feed to since on youtube quite a few jp players have cotton candy on him"
OnePieceTC,3dnbvx,Hail_Mary,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:45:52 2015 UTC,So if I gave a ton of atk and hp cottom candies to my unevolved Mihawk and then evolve him the stats transfer over right?
OnePieceTC,3dnbvx,Bac0,3,Sat Jul 18 03:38:05 2015 UTC,Yeah they transfer
OnePieceTC,3dnbvx,MahPhoenix,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:54:32 2015 UTC,"Aren't the yellow candies useless? If I have a strong slasher like doffy I'll want to give him full ATK and HP, if I have a strong hitter/healer like enel I'll want full ATK and RCV, etc. Since the yellow cotton gives +1 to all stats, won't I waste upgrades? Doffy doesn't need rcv, but a yellow cotton will give him +1, and that +1 is subtracted from the +200 total, meaning one less +atk or +hp.  I hope what I wrote is understandable."
OnePieceTC,3dnbvx,mudmonkey469,2,Sat Jul 18 09:11:20 2015 UTC,"Nah, chances are you will only be able to max 1 or 2 characters unless you farm heavily. Just give it to heavy beat stick like Arlong, Vista..."
OnePieceTC,3dnbvx,SgtIgnite,1 point,Sat Jul 18 11:43:53 2015 UTC,"so i was one of the lucky people that pulled a rayleigh, what stat should i boost?"

OnePieceTC,3dnbvx,SgtIgnite,2,Fri Jul 17 17:51:08 2015 UTC,Don't give Usopp an Attack buff. He doesn't get a combo multiplayer so you arnt adding much damage
OnePieceTC,3dnbvx,TiggerTheTiger1999,1 point,Sat Jul 18 14:52:42 2015 UTC,makes sense ye :)
OnePieceTC,3dnbvx,SgtIgnite,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:56:28 2015 UTC,The HP one makes sense though
OnePieceTC,3dnbvx,TiggerTheTiger1999,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:23:39 2015 UTC,"I like the Idea giving HP to Garp, Zoro, or any other HP buff character"
OnePieceTC,3dnbvx,Kinnikufan,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:08:09 2015 UTC,That works too.
OnePieceTC,3dnbvx,hkreeves,-1,Sat Jul 18 20:37:10 2015 UTC,"I would probably do the same.  GP Usopp with max ATK and HP?  Do want!  Even better recovery Vivi?  Couldn't hurt!  EDIT:  Wow, took almost no time for me to regret this post!  Somehow I had it in my mind that Usopp with higher attack would make some sorta difference.  I stand by the HP though."
OnePieceTC,3dnbvx,Kinnikufan,4,Fri Jul 17 18:02:06 2015 UTC,hp should be added to those captains with 2x hp. Usopp can not get the hp multipler except in Garp team. That is not efficient.
OnePieceTC,3dnbvx,hkreeves,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:24:08 2015 UTC,"I see.  I was just thinking for teams that don't get an HP multiplier at all, since they have mostly heavy hitters, so not as much room to tack on extra HP.  I certainly won't be making Usopp a priority for stat-boosting, but we'll see how much I'm actually able to get before making a decision."
OnePieceTC,3dnbvx,Kinnikufan,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:29:09 2015 UTC,I think usopp is great to carry RCV
OnePieceTC,3dnbvx,hkreeves,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:31:42 2015 UTC,"Makes sense.  I feel like every support character should be recovery first, except maybe Smoker."
OnePieceTC,3dqcmc,ZoroIsBae,0,Sat Jul 18 12:38:08 2015 UTC,Congrats man that was super lucky. I just got Crocodile as well. I had to farm 1/2 stamina all night for it but at least we both got him.

I was gonna quit but decided to do one more pull and if it was someone i liked then i would keep playing. I pulled in evolved chopper, who's my favorite character in the anime. So i kept playing and got really into it within the next week."
OnePieceTC,3dng1v,Pepsuber188,3,Fri Jul 17 18:27:24 2015 UTC,Same I love getting the characters that you actually like the in the series. And it feels even better when you fight as them in a team!
OnePieceTC,3dng1v,HodorsGroceries,6,Fri Jul 17 19:58:21 2015 UTC,I was actually the other way around! I got into the series because of this game. I was really digging the art style and I dived right in. Currently on episode 325 :)

I still have that Tashigi unevolved, didn't need two speed swordsmen and Kuro was the superior choice. I wasted more of my gems than i should have in sugofests, not maxing characters specials when given the opportunity, and my only really good pulls in a total of over 100 tries ( only during sugofests ) were Killer, Nami and Robin.

OnePieceTC,3dng1v,BankaiKenpachi,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:11:03 2015 UTC,"I kinda agree. Ace is surprisingly useless and I used him like a few times only. Shanks and Ace were two units that many players went after when the game was fairly new, but their specials and attacks are just way too weak. I evolved Ace just because it's freakin Ace. By the way, since Lucci's fortnights got Ace skillbooks so you might as well want to evolve him anyway, if you don't want to waste those skillbooks."

Since Lobsters are hard to farm and the island is only there for a limited time i thought this might be useful for some.  I would recommend for F2P-players farming at least:  2 Purple -> Zephyr, Crocodile  1 Blue -> Ivankov  1 Green -> Doffy  If you are confident in getting some of these upcoming characters that are only in the RR-pool or you still have some unevolved supernovas feel free to farm more.  EDIT:  They have 550 ATK/ 50 HP and fit well into vivi/laboon teams.  If you have a low PLVL they might also be interesting since they come only with a cost of 7. Good subs for people who struggle with the cost limit."

Keep in mind that Crocodile only needs lobster for his 5* evolution, which won't be out until Warlord Sugo. In two months time, you have so many story plays that drop you some lobsters.

OnePieceTC,3dpaod,BankaiKenpachi,3,Sat Jul 18 04:08:15 2015 UTC,"Man, you are in a tough spot. I was on the same boat as you since I sold my Usopp early in the game as well. I ran Usopp village during every double drop rate for a few weeks before I got him, so it's possible farming him. It kinda drove me crazy that I got GP Usopp from sugofest two days ago, which was literally useless for me now. So my suggestion would be, keep this account, and farm him during double drop, and reroll a second account looking for G3 or balloon."
OnePieceTC,3dpaod,tohei,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:27:27 2015 UTC,Thing about farming on double drop is that he's not a single boss.  If I remember correctly there are baby turtles too.  The double drop also increases the drop for the baby turtles so it's better to farm on 50% stamina instead.  I accidentally evolved to tobasco star so I've been trying to farm for a while now.
OnePieceTC,3dpaod,ghostaudio,1 point,Sat Jul 18 05:17:09 2015 UTC,"I apologize in advance.  It blows my mind that you could have a L95 Mihawk and not know GPU's unrivaled use.   If you have some spare gems, you could try to pull when psy rates are up.  Your only other option is to farm him again at syrup 1, expect it to be no different from story mode boss drop rates (which are f*cking brutal)."
OnePieceTC,3dpaod,Souuul,2,Sat Jul 18 08:24:22 2015 UTC,"Did the same thing when I was new, did around 50~ runs in Syrup Village 1. You don't want to rely on the severely low chances of getting GP form usopp in RR."
OnePieceTC,3dpaod,ShwimmingAway,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:07:07 2015 UTC,I did the same. Got lucky. RR'd him
OnePieceTC,3dpaod,Gahlokneo,1 point,Sat Jul 18 12:02:55 2015 UTC,I would just farm him on 2x drop days in Syrup Village 1 like others have mentioned. I too screwed my usopp and evolved him into the wrong form. Took me a few weeks of farming only during the 2x drop before I managed to get him to drop the other day. Just keep at it :)
OnePieceTC,3dpaod,rockmandash,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:20:06 2015 UTC,it hurts to see stuff like this but just keep trying that syrup village. mihawk always comes back around though if you were to restart.
OnePieceTC,3dpaod,lamby130,1 point,Sat Jul 18 06:05:28 2015 UTC,Usopp is extremely important. If your account is new and nothing special I would do the following:  A) Farm Syrup Village 1 non-stop using all your gems until you get another Usopp.  B) If A fails then just make a new account as soon as possible. Usopp is just that good.
OnePieceTC,3dpaod,its_0nly_smellz,-1,Sat Jul 18 04:08:53 2015 UTC,you're level 95 with a mihawk and you sold your usopp thinking he had bad stats? LOL  You can farm him on syrup village 1
OnePieceTC,3dpaod,omykun123,2,Sat Jul 18 04:48:54 2015 UTC,"Hey! I sold my Ussop right after finishing his story as well, hadn't done any research so considered him fodder. Fast forward a few weeks, bosses are getting harder, decide to look into strats and find out that GPU is god tier fml...Sugo (I think it was 3 Sugos ago) comes by and he drops.   Now lv 118 with Mihawk Sp Maxed, Cap Kid, G3 and GPU..I'd say I got pretty lucky."
OnePieceTC,3dpaod,its_0nly_smellz,0,Sat Jul 18 05:10:19 2015 UTC,but there is a difference between selling him when you are low level right after getting him and selling him when you are level 95 who was able to farm a mihawk.  this is his box: http://imgur.com/sUTtvXm  LOL

OnePieceTC,3do6sx,RyanKillie,2,Fri Jul 17 21:41:17 2015 UTC,"If you can hit perfects then a G3 Team with Arlong Jozu Ussop and Mihawk will be fine. If you struggle with perfects go MC Arlong Jozu ussop and Mihawk. MC team will make it alot easier to farm if you get him high enough level. You will get decent amount of HP with Jozu and Mihawk, and should be able to clear it, there are multiply guides on youtube you search up to!( For MC teams your level has to be way higher) I'f you can't decide I'd focus levelling arlong and Jozu for now they'will almost for sure be on your team."
OnePieceTC,3do6sx,Adrales,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:48:48 2015 UTC,Do you know f2p way to clear doffy. Dont have jozu or g3
OnePieceTC,3do6sx,rafilfc,2,Fri Jul 17 21:55:48 2015 UTC,"i also dont have jozu or g3, for f2p we will be using double mc mihawk usopp arlong and hoping to coby that perona comes out before doffy.  I've also been experimenting with g3/mc which could allow the use of alvida but only way i've been able to get it to work is if the top doffy is killed b4 the first damage from doffy. i'll probably put up a post on it if i do find a work around."
OnePieceTC,3do6sx,bitereality,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:11:33 2015 UTC,Cheers thanks for the info. Im getting ready for doffy now as my garp burst team is pretty much done after the yellow turtle times we had last week. And im not too concerned in farming ivanakov. So would you say my main priority is to max mihawk mc chopper and arlong. Heres my box  http://imgur.com/a/fkcoM. Cheers mate.
OnePieceTC,3do6sx,rafilfc,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:26:08 2015 UTC,"Nice box by the way, and i'm also not too concerned about ivan well besides the need for a quick unit for the sparse farmable quick pool. You on the right track, arlong, need to get your mc chopper mihawk and usopp specials maxed.  heres what our run should look like  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjJ6qDhAGIk&index=27&list=PLXfucIDqiDplsDBqlcSlrO1iCxyCeGXQ9  some changes we'll have to make  Now, because we dont have jozu, we'll be using g3 friend (this means perfects, one slip and its over) since we will be subbing jozu with alvida and this is the only way the healths will match. This case will only be needed if we cant get perona. If we can get perona then our run will look like this  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YACqFPsfS7s&index=21&list=PLXfucIDqiDplsDBqlcSlrO1iCxyCeGXQ9  We wont stall the way he did in this vid (wont work since perona will block damage to 1620) coz our Usopp special will hopefully be maxed. Rather we will stall like what was done in the previous vid except for the 2nd stage. For the 2nd stage you should stall like how it was done in the last vid i posted. With that, your mihawk special will be ready on firs turn of doffy."
OnePieceTC,3do6sx,bitereality,2,Fri Jul 17 23:34:43 2015 UTC,"Both videos show double MC is possible, but both were by no means safe ways to consistently farm Doffy. They both needed orb luck to clear it. The key is max skilled GP Usopp, and I'm surprised not many players use this strategy: activate GPU's special on stage 4, and it will be activated again just in time against Doffy. This way Mihawk's special can be activated right from the start against Doffy, and also buys three extra turns to get MCs' specials ready if their CDs are not low enough. Max skilled GPU and Mihawk, two MCs with 20ish CDs, Perona and Arlong, that is perhaps the safest way for f2p players. Granted all units need to be high leveled."
OnePieceTC,3do6sx,BankaiKenpachi,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:54:53 2015 UTC,"I think you just skimmed the stuff i wrote rather than read it. Safe ways to farm raids involve gacha units, levels and there are plenty of videos and guides that offer how to do it if you have the units. I dont bother with that. Its trying to make use of farmable units and still doing raids that i work with. As to how close it was, thats why i posted both videos. if both runs had adopted the best from each other which i pointed out below the links, it wouldnt have been that close as i'd already said. They'd have had 1 turn to spare. Same with the need for max specials of usopp for stalling (used in the second video) and mihawk already pointed out. As for the chopper specials, if you are running perona they can be as high as 22, if perona does not come out b4 doffy you need both choppers to be 17, alvida being the farmable sub. Hopefully you read this one."

OnePieceTC,3do6sx,bitereality,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:58:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah makes sense, after watching the video even with max characters he still needed some orb luck. I was thinking in order to farm mihawk would it be more safer doing the 40 stamina? Not too concerned about it atm he is stiĺl far away. But atleast i know what i need to do to prepare. Thanks again for the help."
OnePieceTC,3do6sx,rafilfc,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:17:22 2015 UTC,"with perona orb luck isnt that big a deal. Its if we dont get perona that it becomes really close. Plus you could run blamenco instead of arlong which will help with that and the usopp special at 10 stall before doffy will give another opportunity to farm orbs. But mostly, if you combine the best of the stalls done from both videos, you'll have your mihawk special on first turn with doffy. If the first vid run had done that h'd have used mihawk special on first turn and that run would not have been anywhere as close as it was. The second run, though he had his mihawk special ready unlike the first, his was close coz he was missing a lot of perfects, getting greats instead. If he hadnt probably would have finsihed with an extra turn. Anyway i'll do a more indepth analysis when he gets closer.   you welcome. questions helps me fine tune my team as well"
OnePieceTC,3do6sx,bitereality,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:04:22 2015 UTC,What kind of levels would you need for that team?
OnePieceTC,3do6sx,PEINIS,1 point,Sat Jul 18 10:24:09 2015 UTC,"monstrous levels, we talking max or close to max. This is usually the case for farmable teams on a raids first appearance. On a raids return, we can use better farmable units that came out after which will drop the levels needed. And doffy is 60 stamina, so we talking 90+ for the heavy hitters and 90+ for mihawk. But thats why preping starts from now for f2p"
OnePieceTC,3do6sx,bitereality,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:12:54 2015 UTC,"With G3 and Jozu in the mix, what would I be looking at? Same?"
OnePieceTC,3do6sx,PEINIS,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:24:16 2015 UTC,"with g3 and jozu levels needed go down. You have no hp constraints to worry about so lv 80 should work though i'd have to run numbers to figure out what damage you need since lv 80 on your strength units will drop your team base damage by 50k. Also with perona instead of alvida, levels will go down as well since hp constraint will be reduced as well"
OnePieceTC,3do6sx,bitereality,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:54:12 2015 UTC,"Ok, just because most of my STR's are in the 30s - G3 is 50 though at least, thanks."

OnePieceTC,3do6sx,HelplessKid,1 point,Sat Jul 18 11:19:42 2015 UTC,"I think they are both roughly 10 weeks away. Doffy comes after Zephyr and Ivankov and Perona after Lucci, Frankie, Kraken, Hogback.

And the 60 stam one will only give a higher Doffy Character like Lv 30-40 ? Because most 40 stamina raidbosses drops the characters around Lv 20 @Mihawk for example.

Voting is, at heart, a ranking system. If nobody upvotes but everybody downvotes, you're still sorted by the best answers, even if they have less karma. This only matters if you take karma points as personal validation.  It's fine to think this sub should be more inclusive (it actually is OPTC sub, not OPTCGlobal sub, makes sense), but people will always downvote everything not relevant to them because there's no OPTCGlobal or OPTCJapan sub. Some may feel it's disrespectful to Japanese players, but this game is much more popular in Japan and Japan has Gamewith and other resources while this is one of the only active places for Global players and the fact that it's in English and not Japanese makes it the de facto hangout for Global players.  And while it might be fun for some to read the exact walkthroughs on what to do to beat a boss in a single player game, others would prefer to have first crack at the boss without specific strategies already laid out for them. In other words, it's not as big of an advantage being spoonfed strategies from JPN as you think it is. Personally I'd prefer it if both Global and JPN get content released at the same time, and I know others feel the same way."
OnePieceTC,3dlpf8,365Triggers,2,Fri Jul 17 15:06:17 2015 UTC,"I see where you're coming from, but I can't buy into that world view. I don't think community empathy is beyond any of us. There is also a significant difference between me giving up on luxuries in order to support charity and someone not down-voting content on a Reddit sub. Of course my happiness and well-being is important to me, but I, as a person, am no more important than anyone else on the planet (for the most part) and to act differently is to not abide by the unwritten rules by which modern society functions. Completely selfish behavior such as you've described is a mental health problem. Surely consideration of others is a sign of a well rounded and balanced individual?  The way scoring systems like FB, imgur, 4chan, et al work is exactly what you've outlined above, and for those platforms, it's ideal. But, Reddit became popular for its ability to self-moderate. Good conversations (irrespective of whether they apply to the individual reader) that benefit a sub's community should rise to the top. Self moderation is not the same as ""me like, me click"" score boarding.  Maybe you're right: perhaps I'm being unrealistic - not nihilistic enough - about humanity."
OnePieceTC,3dlpf8,syngin-ps4,1 point,Sat Jul 18 10:21:20 2015 UTC,"You shouldn't feel the need to buy into that worldview. After all, the world would be worse off without people like you. My point was that when push comes to shove, most people will always look out for #1. When things are less dire, their drive will still be focused on pleasing themselves. For some, this will be to further hoard goods and resources. For others, through the feeling of satisfaction that comes from knowing they've helped somebody. Many have adopted a simplistic and efficient way to combine both through low-effort means, e.g. armchair activism (""1 like = 1 prayer"", signing a quick Internet petition), to feel good about themselves while doing the least amount of work. The mentality behind this strategy is what's also driving drive-by downvoting: ""I don't want to see this content anymore so I'll click downvote to shape the world as I see fit."" Very little effort involved, no explanations, completely anonymous, move on to next post. I'm not making a moral evaluation on this behaviour -- merely pointing out that it's human nature and to expect otherwise is to invite disappointment. Case in point: I fully expected downvotes from my initial post because it's not something ""positive"" ""humorous"" or tailor-made for upvotes. I leave all of my posts up to remind me of which communities to lessen my involvement in. I did not predict that I'd get thoughtful replies though, especially in this sub, and am pleasantly surprised. Imagine that."

Downvoting Japanese content is dumb, people do it because it doesn't seem to be relevant to them. My brother is one of those people who just wants to play the game without looking up strategies before you try it which is truly playing the game. However, Japanese content and discussion is essential for making quality guides which many people do use. I only play Global because I don't have time to play the Japanese version, but that would be awesome if both got content at the same time. Otherwise, global will always be quite predictable which takes the fun out of the game for some. Sadly, content released for both at the same time will most likely never happen."

I'd rather see ""Whom should I level up or ""What is the best team I can make with this box"" which, admittedly, are also just a picture of their box, but those topics at least have the opportunity to lead to meaningful discussion. When you just post your box and are like ""Welp, here it is!

OnePieceTC,3dn7y3,Kinnikufan,3,Fri Jul 17 17:18:44 2015 UTC,"I guess I've been fairly lucky in terms of rare recruits; I don't have G3, Killer, Rayleigh, or Whitebeard, but I do have Robin, Vista, Marco, Ace, and a couple of other fairly decent RR characters. However, aside from turtle hunting and the occasional color bosses, I found that a lot of the times I can create a team based on my f2p in game units and do just fine with the current content (mainly Monster Chopper, Mihawk Slasher, and a DEX one led by Zoro).  As a result, rare recruit just made the game a lot more interesting, and the only pressure I really felt from doing so was because I wanted to get a character that I really liked (looking at YOU Robin :D). I guess it really depends on the kind of mentality you have when playing this game, but overall, I think it allows me to just have fun with what I have, and try to make something work. There's always that bit of pride you get from figuring something out by yourself rather than having to resort to help guides and videos, but again, that's just me.  That being said, I think it DEFINITELY helps to know what you are doing, especially early on in the game as there are some things that you need to figure out for yourself (such as learning not to feed Usopp to somebody else... *facepalm)... That logic could potentially also extend to RR's."
OnePieceTC,3dn7y3,BlueDaruma,2,Fri Jul 17 18:06:48 2015 UTC,"Early awareness is extremely important.  Can't say I've gotten rid of any characters that I regretted, but I definitely wasted gems early on.  As for rare recruit, it hasn't been terrible to me (got every character I really wanted outside of White Beard), but I am still lacking some pretty useful ones, like every DEX character exclusive to it.  But I can't complain when I have Ace, Shanks, G3, Vista, Marco, Jozu, and Urouge.  And it saved me from farming some of the most annoying characters (Baroque Works Agents, pretty much all of them)."

OnePieceTC,3dn7y3,_Madara_,3,Fri Jul 17 17:39:19 2015 UTC,"Well, if not Momonga, you could try for Ryuuma, who's farmable with Brook's isle plus hits a lot harder.

OnePieceTC,3dn7y3,bitereality,2,Fri Jul 17 23:22:11 2015 UTC,"If your team is not strong enough to farm raid bosses, then I would argue you are better off using your gems for Sugofest as opposed to refilling stamina and whatnot, because the Rare Recruit characters are just that strong, they will make your teams flat out better than they would be if you just used farmable characters.  However, it's not like you need every single RR character in the game.  Like a game of poker, the fun comes from making the most of the cards you're dealt."
OnePieceTC,3dn7y3,eventual12345,2,Fri Jul 17 19:39:44 2015 UTC,"That's a very good point.  Rare recruit is definitely more important at the earlier stages of the game and when a raid boss comes around.

Thats 35 gems which refilling stamina on a raidboss will come close to maxing if not maxing his skill. But you are right, you need to have a strong enough team to farm the raid bosses and there is fun in pulling if you realize as f2p you cant pull expecting to get what you want or need unless you really lucky. So far, all raidbosses are farmable with farmable units, and with some research and time your team will get strong enough to farm the raid bosses currently available to global without gacha units. my thoughts anyway"

If you dont get tnami or vista as well, you will still be incomplete. If you are going to be waiting for next sugo then won't it be better to use your gems for the fortnight isles and turtle times instead. Mihawk made his return few days ago. f2p who didnt spend all their gems pulling were able to max him if you'd been playing long enough to get mchopper  for f2p, being able to farm raid bosses on their first appearance is hard theres no doubt. The game isnt structured for it to be easy without gacha units. How it is structured is f2p can get a copy and with farmable units from next raid beat the raid before. Except for zephyr, he doesnt need waiting for his return.  As for farmable only teams for raids, heres My experience and plans, i got one copy of mihawk when he first came using zombie team, also the same with mchopper, as well as garp. With mihawks return, i was able to max him with mchopper arlong usopp, mihawk and alvida. Pulled twice during sugo. when mc returns i'll be using double mihawk lucci kaku usopp and likely kuro or arlong to mass farm him. zephyr i'll be using double garp usopp mirage tempo and alvida to mass farm him. Reason being i found a zeph int team that outbursts robin tnami int team. Using the zephyr int burst team, i'll mass farm garp on his return.

OnePieceTC,3dn7y3,Zee_n1,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:47:25 2015 UTC,I agree with you.  I should've specified that the main focus on using the gacha is to get good captains.  Asura Zoro and raid bosses are the only captains that can stand up to the rare recruit-only captains.

Max skilled Mihawk & Doffy, either 1 of Mr 1, then a few good slashers for each color (Arlong, Lucci, Ryuma, Croc/Helmeppo/Mr 3)  Ideally though, it's good to try to get 1-2 good new units during each Sugo to make the most of teambuilding, especially with a lot of the restrictions on the new fortnights. You want a team for each color and a team for each class type...and even captains that are under 49 cost :)"

Should I just stop/slow down with pulls and focus more on gemming for raid bosses to up their skills (My Mihawk is only slvl 5,  other raid bosses are lvl 1)? Which ones should I give priority to?"
OnePieceTC,3dn7y3,madPsychic,2,Fri Jul 17 22:46:44 2015 UTC,"I would say, given what you have, use gems more for stamina refills on raid bosses with useful specials (if you have more than 80 total) and some of the fortnight islands (if you have above 90 total) and box space. You should still pull from rare recruit during Sugofest, but maybe just a few. It can be hard to stop, so I usually set myself a soft limit and a hard limit.

Those 22 pulls equate to 110 gems, which is a lot of levels for both my account and all my characters if I take full advantage of turtle time.  Of course, I think this strategy is only viable with a 6* and/or G3, and since I don't have any of those on my main I'm stuck pulling and hoping."

I don't think I could give up on pulling during Sugofest, but I found out with this one that the announcement for Mihawk did force me to pull only half as much as I would have."
OnePieceTC,3dn7y3,madPsychic,2,Fri Jul 17 18:00:20 2015 UTC,"Yes, but you could just as easily have gotten junk instead of Vista and Robin.

OnePieceTC,3dn7y3,Reispirat,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:17:19 2015 UTC,"Most RR pulls have skills that help their own color/type teams so if you are already running G3 or a slasher team then there isn't much benefit.  The closest units to being ""must-haves"" from rare recruit are going to be Jozu, Robin, and Streaming Wolf Zoro because of the utility they provide in killing certain bosses.   Basically not pulling lowers your flexibility and options for a change of pace but is nowhere near mandatory if you already had a strong start or a skilled Mihawk."

He also gives a lot more health than Alvida/Perona who would be units that fill the same role as subs. This increases your chance of success due to more hp and taking zero damage instead of 20% for a turn.

I already got killer, tashigi, sanji/Mr.Prince and now with Lucci coming up I should have a decent QCK team by the time Doflamingo arrives. Might try to farm Kuro as well. If you don't have an Ace is clearing the isle possible? Also what would be preferable Jozu/Ace or double Jozu? I realize the first one would give more damage overall but the second would allow you to use the Jozu special 2 times, so I'm not really sure.  EDIT Nevermind I'm dumb, just realized Doflamingo is Dex-type :/"
OnePieceTC,3doi0g,Reispirat,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:14:30 2015 UTC,"I have the same exact thought. Like you, not sure how the additional skill/special going to work. But I have been farming Fat Usopp and plan to save him at least until the 4.0 update which will be on the 21/07 if I am correct. I suggest you do the same, especially because he is a guarantee drop in his island (you can't get Usopp any easier than this). Of course this is assuming you have enough space in your box. Just my two cents.  Besides I am farming for GP Usopp and Impact Usopp manuals so the more reason for me to farm Fat Usopp island. :)"
OnePieceTC,3doi0g,rubbertrain12,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:00:40 2015 UTC,"I figured it out very late, so I just will be able to get him 2 or 3 times. I had no reason to farm this island, because I already have 21 Gp books :b"
OnePieceTC,3doi0g,rubbertrain12,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:02:41 2015 UTC,Wow I wish I had that many books. I just got 3 GP books from Kuro and have yet to get any from this Fat Usopp Island so far (10+ runs) XD. RNG man...

OnePieceTC,3dn4ku,jdops,4,Fri Jul 17 16:54:03 2015 UTC,"This game actually doesn't have a power creep so earlier characters are still very relevant in Japan. That said the characters you should be aiming for are: 6 star legends(obv.), 2.5x Capts, orb changers/boosters, and more.   This link should give you a good idea of what type characters you should be aiming for: http://op-tc-eng-version.blogspot.com.au/p/tier-list.html"
OnePieceTC,3dn4ku,airborne_whale,3,Fri Jul 17 17:50:56 2015 UTC,"In the upcoming Fortnight, Rob Lucci instantly becomes one of the stronger QCk characters (strongest QCK slasher), and Kaku is very similar to Coby V2.  Kaku would probably be Tier 1, Lucci Tier 1 or 1.5.  Zephyr will be a Tier 1 as the 2.5 shooter captain whenever his raid comes, though the shooter pool is somewhat weak.  As far as the important characters to know that were released in the little window between Biker Smoker's fortnight and now, here's sort of where they would be on that list (just my quick opinion using the list's ranking structure):  Rayleigh would be in the God tier as just a stupidly powerful Captain.  Tier-1   Kidd:  The premier Impact captain for the foreseeable future (even now in Japan?).  Also, great special with short cool down. Garp:  Highly valued as PSY captain because of his ability to combo with Mr. 2 for full PSY orbs (and then Impact Usopp and Coby for insane damage), as well as his HP buff working extremely well with Marco's special.   Tier 1.5   Apoo:  Only really if you have a Law, for the full DEX orb combo. Tsuru:  Best shooter captain for now.  Good sub once Zephyr comes out. Paulie:  Same special as Hina (so see her description on that list), but a DEX character.  Not bad stats either.   Tier 2   Khalifa:  I guess.  I didn't want to get into Tier 2 but she can combo with Izo or Zeff to get full DEX orbs, which Paulie can then lock.  Not the greatest stats though.   Edit: Formatting."
OnePieceTC,3dn4ku,Ezrius,4,Fri Jul 17 18:37:02 2015 UTC,"Tsuru and Khalifa should be switched. Tsuru's cap ability is actually merely OK. And she serves nothing much more than a sub in the future Shooter team.  Khalifa's ability gives a very rich possiblity of combos. She can do full red, full green, full blue with different partners. That is very versatile and useful. Not a unit so far can offer those in one pack. She may even be ranked higher than Apoo, which is pretty much one way use."
OnePieceTC,3dn4ku,hkreeves,2,Fri Jul 17 19:35:51 2015 UTC,Agreed. IMO Khalifa has a way better special than Apoo.
OnePieceTC,3dn4ku,koryuken,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:59:19 2015 UTC,That's fair.  For instance Capone can convert to full blue and Blamenco to full red.  Takes a spot from the blue/red characters on those teams but I can see why she might be run on those teams.
OnePieceTC,3dn4ku,Ezrius,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:40:15 2015 UTC,I already had a look on that link and have g3 and wb. Didnt have rayleigh on the lisy so wasnt sure how reliable and relevant it was to where japan is at
OnePieceTC,3dn4ku,day2k,3,Fri Jul 17 20:57:26 2015 UTC,"Instead of crucial units, I just want to say that pretty much all the 5* gatcha units have their uses as the ""most suitable"" unit, if only for a handful of events. Orb converters to use against certain bosses that convert your orbs, 3x risky captains for each colored turtle, etc.  Secret units are generally weaker than their regular counterparts. Other than secret units, I think the one weakest and least useful of the bunch is probably Jewelry Bonney. She may be useful in the future for certain events, but currently I'm not aware of any.  So far I haven't seen any ""strictly better"" units for the 5* gatchas either. However, one unit that I would always pick over the previous version is SW Shanks vs v1 Shanks.   Whitey Bay has better stats and shares the same captain ability as Towel Nami, but Nami has a more widely applicable special. I would even pick Ace over Boa for certain fortnights where there is lots of poison and preemptives. However, barring any restrictions, I would always pick SW Shanks over v1 Shanks."
OnePieceTC,3dn4ku,Reispirat,2,Fri Jul 17 22:14:25 2015 UTC,"Here is my opinion on which Rare-Recruit characters still will be very good in the future:   Whitebeard, Rayleigh and G3(obviously) V2 Nami, Robin, Vista Killer(his stats are great, but it doesnt hurt if you dont have him) Marco(his special is really useful) Kid, Urogue Law, Apoo Ace, Jozu(he is really useful for green raidbosses) Shanks, Imapct Usopp   Of course characters like Izo, Blamenco or Capone are really good orb manipulators, but there will be other ways to get perfect orbs.  This is just my opinion and it does not have to be true."

OnePieceTC,3dn4ku,bitereality,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:39:59 2015 UTC,"I dont know if its necessary for burst teams. I think you can for example beat Zephyr with marco burst team without using his skill. But if you have your skill maxed, it would be much easier to beat him.  For Blackbeard teams it is a must, so if you want to make a Blackbeard team as soon as he comes to global, you should try to max Marco."

OnePieceTC,3dn4ku,XtendedImpact,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:50:46 2015 UTC,"In my opinion, current the rare recruit units who will be definitely be useful in the future are:      ♠ All the 6 *  WB for Aokiji raid boss, Rayleigh for Heracles / casual fortnight island / Story      ♠ Marco for heal in garp team      ♠ Jozu!!!!! allow you to farm 3 raid bosses without gems  (Blackbeard, Monster Chopper, and Doflaminggo) ♠ Vista for princess turtle      ♠ Law and apo for Enel raid boss turn all orbs to green (can be changed to kalifha and zeff/izo, but you lost a lot of attack power)      Don't feel bad if you do not have any the above, you can still do most of the raid bosses but you might need to revive with gems. I would say Jozu is the best Rare recruit you want if you have limited gems      Remember this, Jozu, enable you to farm 3 raid bosses without gems, 1 Farm monster Chopper --> use him and Jozu to farm max Doflaminggo special 2 Farm Blackbeard --> Max his skill 3 With max SP Mihawk and Dofflaminggo you can probably beat Enel without gems 4 With max SP blackbeard you can easily beat Heracles and Duffal."

OnePieceTC,3dn4ku,KSmoria,1 point,Sat Jul 18 11:06:42 2015 UTC,He hasn't been mentioned yet but QCK Enel is so valuable. He increases QCK ATK by 2.25 and restores your health by 5x his RCV at the end of the turn. (2 high level Enel = 2000HP) The great thing is that he's a raid boss. The bad thing is that he's a really hard raid boss that'll arrive in a couple of months.

Settling down for a moment, this truly IS a poor move, or lack thereof, by management. Getting all these events is nice, and it results in us players receiving plenty of rare materials that oftentimes we cannot completely and immediately use. These events are sort of pointless efforts if we are not able to save up our precious resources without creating another deficit to make space we never had in the first place. Immediately, this brings to mind how it has been increasingly difficult to make as many Monday turtle runs. If Bandai Namco thinks about it, if we are unable to get in as many turtle runs, we are gemming less. And they want us to buy gems; that's where their revenue comes from. If they expanded the box space, we will gem to increase box space, and with that, be able to gem more during turtle time. Expanding the box space is a win-win situation. I would really like a Bandai Namco employee to see this comment and what other people have to say, and try to tell us what's up with this. I have spent more money on this game than than it takes to buy multiple physical copies of console games, and I dedicate time each day to play One Piece Treasure Cruise. I would like to see them stop all these events for a month if it means they will solve one of the biggest pressing issues for dedicated players, their cash cows. For Bandai Namco to increase box space in OPTC is something that is long overdue.  .  Thanks to everyone who took the time to read my comment. Share your thoughts with me."

So are you holding characters that you will never use, or materials you will never use waiting for new characters? Let's say you have 50 useful characters you keep for teams, and 50 materials; so you have 100 spaces left. Are you holding the turtles for double exp?  I'm just trying to understand this coming up so much, not meaning to offend if its taken that way. I have 175 box space (Didn't cap it), and 155 is used. I maybe have 50 characters favorited, then I have an issue of holding skill books for characters I don't have which I should cure."

OnePieceTC,3dlo0q,Radioactiveman271,2,Fri Jul 17 14:05:03 2015 UTC,So right now with double skill you're getting space back? Or are you holding books for characters you don't have? I Have this issue because I have like 13 books for Mr. 3. He doesn't drop and I never get him during Sugo pulls.

That hits around 40. These are all premium evo materials that are expensive to farm. Besides, cheap evo mats like penguins/crabs/hemit crabs, I keep ~2 of each so that I never need to farm them when needed. Above that, there are unevolved pigs, baby turtles (especially yellow, extremely difficult to farm a lot in story).   Materials take up 100 space easily, not that I abuse hoarding them. I keep them the minimum amount."
OnePieceTC,3dlo0q,hkreeves,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:43:05 2015 UTC,"We recently had the Alvida isle return, which gave us Alvida manuals and Gaimon (important for Broggy), on top of the multiple yellow turtle day event. That was over 30 rare materials I was not going to waste before a Special Level Up event was here. The only reason why I didn't struggle to make space for turtle runs without full box warning interruptions was that I gave up turtle runs, for the hopes of pulling Rayleigh (no cigar). I think you're not seeing how important it is to have at least 50 empty slots to smoothly make turtle runs. .  Really, what I'm storing shouldn't matter with all the units they've hyped, released and are continuing to release. I shouldn't have to toss my Choppers or 4* Hachi because Bandai Namco has not properly given us the room to grow.   There are people out there who do want to collect every unit, and if Bandai Namco wants that to be part of the game and those people to be part of the playerbase, they need to give us the measures to be able to do so. Why should we have to sacrifice how we want to play the game? They can't store a few more kb of data for each player? They might as well not release new units if that's the case. This should not even be an issue at this point in the game. Keep in mind Japan got their box expansion during 2.1."

OnePieceTC,3dlo0q,Kinnikufan,2,Fri Jul 17 13:15:21 2015 UTC,That'll be cool; have a bit more variety in your gameplay. I'd probably alternate between whichever one has the double drop/ half stamina event going on.
OnePieceTC,3dlo0q,BlueDaruma,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:50:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's a good strategy.  2 days of half-stamina, 2 days of double-drop.  Of course I'll want to farm the other Baroque Works Agents as well, but if we don't have more box space by then I might hold off."
OnePieceTC,3dlo0q,Kinnikufan,2,Fri Jul 17 14:00:00 2015 UTC,"Discussion:  Who is the best unit to put cotton candy on? i read on the patch notes, u can have a max of 100? with a total accumulated amount of 300? :S"

OnePieceTC,3dlo0q,KamiLuka,0,Fri Jul 17 16:00:22 2015 UTC,Yup
OnePieceTC,3dlo0q,DJ_Hamster,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:44:00 2015 UTC,Serious question: what are people's box space filled with that makes them max out to 200? Is it all the turtles? I'm gonna assume it's because of turtle hoarding because I have quite a few characters and all the evolution materials I need for the characters not yet evolved and that still doesn't max out my 130 box space. Should I be hoarding more turtles then? And when should I save them for? I'm unable to even do the friend game because I don't have a gps app
OnePieceTC,3dlo0q,kingofdabz,3,Fri Jul 17 16:54:49 2015 UTC,"It's quite easy to get to max 200 especially if you started day 1. I started when the game was about a month old in global and I've been at max 200 for the past 2 months. A lot of the box is filled with evos, turtles, rare recruits, story isle drops, and skill books.   I personally keep as much of the evos as needed, for those that are near the level to evolve. And the rest of the space, well it is filled with characters. 50 of my slots are characters I favorited for team purposes and there are probably another 20 or so that aren't, ie. fodder. Then the rest are filled with hard to farm evos like Elder Sea Stallion, Lobsters, Rainbow Hermit/Penguins. And of course if you did a lot of Pig Island then you may have a lot of those colored pigs you can't evolve yet due to lack of turtles."
OnePieceTC,3dlo0q,NibPies,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:04:46 2015 UTC,"Ahh okay I see, I think I know the difference now between what I do and people with max 200. I'm in exactly your spot as well, I started playing about a month and a half in and play every day, but when I get skillbooks and turtles I use them almost immediately. I know I should be saving them for events that boost my chance at super success and all that, but I always think about my box space and that makes me want to use my turtles right away on characters. And I keep the evolutions of ONLY the characters that need evolving and the exact number of evolutions for all the characters, which cuts down my box space too. I also like to collect the useless story characters like Johnny and yosaku etc. it's really interesting, I guess box space expansion is for people saving up turtles and skillbooks haha"
OnePieceTC,3dlo0q,kingofdabz,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:46:55 2015 UTC,"There's also the fact that missions are coming to every island soon. Right now we have it with Fushia Village, but soon all islands will have missions like the Japan version. Some missions need you to use certain characters, ie. Momoo is needed to complete one of the missions in Fushia. Johnny and Yosaku will be needed for another one soon, Shell's Town. So all those characters that we save aren't completely useless. They can potentially be thrown away or fused later on once missions are over."
OnePieceTC,3dlo0q,NibPies,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:54:16 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah for sure I just meant useless in fortnight isles, raids, and story but it's cool that they're giving us missions now, gives us a reason to collect unevolved characters now also xD"
OnePieceTC,3dlo0q,kingofdabz,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:20:20 2015 UTC,Do the old missions go away from fuchsia when the new missions come in? Still haven't been able to get a momoo so I'm a bit worried.

OnePieceTC,3dlo0q,syngin-ps4,-1,Sat Jul 18 01:01:49 2015 UTC,How do we actually get cotton candy?
OnePieceTC,3dlo0q,Frikcha,2,Fri Jul 17 09:21:30 2015 UTC,The update notice said that they drop randomly in twin Cape and every island after. I assume they'll be like cola but rarer and only on the grand line islands. I also heard someone say that you can get them from den-den-mushi snails.
OnePieceTC,3dlo0q,Ninjafro,2,Fri Jul 17 10:28:48 2015 UTC,I think the Den-Den-Mushi snails will only drop them for the duration of the summer event. After that it's only from story islands.

OnePieceTC,3dlo0q,BlueDaruma,1 point,Fri Jul 17 10:56:19 2015 UTC,"Does anybody know if there's a set time/ event as to when they appear, like turtle isles? Or do you just gotta keep looking?"

OnePieceTC,3dojxv,Spitroo,5,Fri Jul 17 23:32:00 2015 UTC,How else do you plan on levelling up your non-INT characters? Only powering up characters with matching color turtles may be inefficient but its definitely necessary at this stage.
OnePieceTC,3dojxv,lookingforlaboons,2,Fri Jul 17 23:39:49 2015 UTC,It is a common practice to use black turtles on every color.   The Later you realize that the more you fall behind with your other teams. Start leveling up you colored units now.
OnePieceTC,3dojxv,hkreeves,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:58:22 2015 UTC,"Croc (mr 0) is coming in the new patch. Awesome unit from what i can tell from blog, I'm in the same boat as u (having lots of black turtles). But i will farm him... if he drops, then i will invest all the turtiles into him. But it depends on box space as well. i have tons of box space as i recently evolved so many supernovas (ty scissors cavern)  TLDR: if u r willing to farm for croc save the turtles awesome and strong unit, also take box space into consideration"
OnePieceTC,3dojxv,ThePoizesto,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:03:20 2015 UTC,At the moment all mine go into PSY charcters ready for Zephyr. After he is finished they will go into DEX ready for Ivankov.
OnePieceTC,3dojxv,MinTef,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:43:04 2015 UTC,"If you have the int units that need the turtles then definitely use them on the int units. It's not unfair to say that neglecting this bonus is a huge inefficiency in turtle use.  Of course if all the int units you have are not worth leveling, then use the int turtles however you see fit."
OnePieceTC,3dojxv,ghostaudio,1 point,Sat Jul 18 08:28:25 2015 UTC,Black turtles are the bread 'n butter to leveling all units in global.

OnePieceTC,3dojxv,Cubed1437,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:23:26 2015 UTC,"Yea, I would definitely use INT turtles on other colour. Personally what I did was get all my INT characters very high then feed turtles to others, Your characters won't get as much has exp as usually but its still alot."
OnePieceTC,3dojxv,Adrales,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:38:26 2015 UTC,Every Monday for turtle time I pick out 1 or 2 units to dump all the turtles into to prepare either for next fortnight isle or next raid. That way I feel like I made some progress instead of spreading the EXP too thin and not feeling like I accomplished anything.
OnePieceTC,3dojxv,xfizzle,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:32:36 2015 UTC,"I need to start doing this, my units are ok atm just really need to make them powerhouses one at a time."
OnePieceTC,3dojxv,HodorsGroceries,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:33:50 2015 UTC,"Stats scale linearly while exp scales exponentially, leveling characters one at a time instead of spreading the exp out across the team is generally worse.  A high level captain and friend will already use up the end of the chain multipliers so there aren't significant gains anywhere else in the chain damage wise.  If you are good at clearing and making turtle times there are way more turtles coming in than units worth leveling so you will eventually be focusing on one or two units at a time anyways but there isn't a mathematical reason to not get everyone you plan on using intos the 70s first."

Thankfully only took about 45 copies to max from level 3, but I didn't finish until very late.    The second account wasn't as bad, even though I had less luck with skill-ups.  The reason is that I did a few here and there during the day rather than all at once, before power farming the last hour or so.

OnePieceTC,3dmtzd,hkreeves,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:00:54 2015 UTC,Np he's lvl 71 though so still pretty high ^
OnePieceTC,3dmtzd,Ezrius,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:03:32 2015 UTC,"Ofc, his skill lvl is way more important than his lvl.   I refused to feed xp to him since many weeks ago as I foresaw that I need his skillups with his copies. I intended to keep cost low so I kept him on 55 when others rushed to send him to max lv. But sadly, his skill is still not maxed for me yet, so he will be stay on 80 until he come back next time."

OnePieceTC,3dmtzd,BlueDaruma,2,Fri Jul 17 17:16:17 2015 UTC,"That is a right plan, and you get rewarded by maxing his skill. A maxed skill Mihawk is 1000x more important than trying for Rayleigh with odds ~ 1/1000.   I am also f2p and had 50+ gems left after sugo. I failed to max Mihawk not because of gems but because of time constraint."

OnePieceTC,3dlv8j,tadabola,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:59:08 2015 UTC,"think his special is kind of like using double killer. The special really is for finishing of the enemy.

OnePieceTC,3dlv8j,bitereality,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:00:33 2015 UTC,"The HP has to be over 50% for the ability to let you survive to 1 HP, so unless you have max hp 4000, tsuru heal isn't enough :P"

But Aokiji and even Blackbeard and Doffy are somehow tough - especially if you're planning to farm them.   And it shows how important Mihawk and Doffy are. You'll get more Cola since Den Den Mushi appear and starting with Kalifa's isle Cola drops more regularly from fortnight isles.   Good luck with maxing merry. And you have at least half a year time for preparations."

OnePieceTC,3dlrd0,pakxmanx21,2,Fri Jul 17 09:06:24 2015 UTC,"its a pretty powerful special tbh, and while its still tough to use at 20cd, its basically impossible at 30 outside of zombie teams where the skill is pointless anyway. im going to farm to max it personally, its certainly one of the better skllbooks we've had so far on global thats for sure. dont stress over it though, as i said, a 20cd is still too long for a lot of content so while the ability itself is pretty OP, the large CD makes it rather niche to use, Double Garp teams are an example of where it can thrive, its actually horrid how long you can last vs zephyr with the right team"
OnePieceTC,3dlrd0,BankaiKenpachi,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:24:06 2015 UTC,I have no idea but I would really like to max it. 30 turns takes waaay too long.
OnePieceTC,3dlrd0,yorunomegami,1 point,Fri Jul 17 08:24:23 2015 UTC,"Maxing his skill is also waaaay too long. Without skillup event, one may need 80-100 books to max, and his book is so rare, that is like 500 runs maybe.   That is 500-runs-of-Lucci30 long."

OnePieceTC,3dnn3e,Cubed1437,1 point,Sat Jul 18 08:49:58 2015 UTC,"Use turtles on your main team and the strong leaders if you have some (Ashura Zoro, Arlong etc). It's not always possible to match the turtle color for the bonus (especially with INT turtles) but that's fine. Use baby tutrles only for levels 20-30 and keep them to evolve pigs.  Maxing someone is very expensive. Usually the amount of exp needed for the last 80-99 levels isn't worth it. Getting a char to 80 is all you need most of the time."

All of the bosses are fairly solid units stat-wise so that's also something to consider.  Some of the more important fortnight units off the top of my head: Coby/Kaku (interchangeable if you want to gimp yourself by msising a type bonus), Paulie/Hina (same), Alvida/Perona (same), Lucci/Arlong (great slasher units), Buggy (orb manip), Kraken (orb manip), Khalifa(combos with Izo if you dont have Law/Apoo), Cindry (orb manip), I think that covers ones that we've already had and the upcoming ones for awhile."
OnePieceTC,3dlj3j,raistlyn,3,Fri Jul 17 08:49:59 2015 UTC,Perfect! exact answer I was looking for once again ! Thanks for always coming clutch!
OnePieceTC,3dlj3j,DblBeast,-1,Fri Jul 17 09:54:45 2015 UTC,"I'll add that Hina > Paulie as an orb locker simply because you're gonna be able to farm more copies of Hina than Paulie to get that low cooldown (unless you really care about Types). For similar reasons, the purple marine is also better than Buggy. Obviously the marine's easier to farm, plus he actually has more attack than Buggy (850 vs 767 I believe). This is more opinionated than objective, but ""objective"" isn't always practical."
OnePieceTC,3dlj3j,syngin-ps4,-1,Fri Jul 17 11:32:01 2015 UTC,I see you didn't mention Zephyr and I seem to recall reading that his special level isn't critical until shooter teams are actually relevant (SW Ace etc). Is that the situation?
OnePieceTC,3dlj3j,itspabo,3,Fri Jul 17 09:27:31 2015 UTC,Actually just the other day somebody did an analysis on a basic F2P zephyr team and compared it to the gach INT team Tnami/robin and apparently zephyr can out damage them so it wouldn't be too bad of an investment in the case that you can't get Tnami.  Original analysis
OnePieceTC,3dlj3j,syngin-ps4,1 point,Fri Jul 17 11:19:29 2015 UTC,"Good to know. I do remember seeing this; not sure why it didn't stick. My INT team is normally TNami with a full complement of burst units, so I'm happy with that. I prefer to run rainbow teams and a shooter captain sounds delightful."
OnePieceTC,3dlj3j,itspabo,1 point,Fri Jul 17 11:28:11 2015 UTC,"Farming zephyr now would give you time to future proof for when SW Ace releases but it's also likely he'd come back for a 2nd rotation sometime then too and since shooter teams are really dependent on herc and sw units, it's definitely not an urgent thing to do. With that being said herc will be crucial to farm if you do end up with a SW Ace.  I think aokiji and Blackbeard would also be on the list of ""to farm"" raidbosses, the first being more important if you have Kidd and the latter simply because his special synergizes so well with himself as a unique lead."
OnePieceTC,3dlj3j,raistlyn,1 point,Fri Jul 17 11:38:21 2015 UTC,"He could still be a decent captain with max skill if you don't have Nami/Ray/Vista for now, but yeah overall not really useful until Ace"
OnePieceTC,3dlj3j,troubled_bison,4,Fri Jul 17 09:35:02 2015 UTC,"They are all worth farming, in my opinion. If you are looking for the must have though, Doflamingo & Mihawk is the general consensus.  Mihawk's 30% HP reduce is one of the best specials in the game. Double Mihawk allows you to cut a boss' HP by half at the start of the battle.  Doflamingo's special allows you to swap orbs twice, then boost their effectiveness by 2x.  Other raidbosses are specialized or geared towards specific teams. i.e. Enel for speed teams, Zephyr for shooters, Aokiji for strikers, etc. But Mihawk and Doflamingo can find a spot in most teams."

OnePieceTC,3dlj3j,vanminhu,1 point,Fri Jul 17 06:32:30 2015 UTC,Yeah just maxed my mihawk in level and skill today. Pretty exciting . And doffy is my favorite character so I plan to farm him a lot. Hopefully I'm high enough level to run it twice during the event .

OnePieceTC,3dlj3j,Birdy88,1 point,Fri Jul 17 09:28:41 2015 UTC,"Thanks, but the blog ones are pretty vague, looking for the safest possible teams to consistantly win  Given Doffy has 2.4 million HP each I image G3 is highly hit or miss compared to when farming Mihawk for example.  Sure I saw people here say a specific monster chopper team were great for it, but can't find it now"
OnePieceTC,3dlj3j,yorunomegami,1 point,Fri Jul 17 11:41:39 2015 UTC,"Right. I'm sure we'll see guides aplenty eventually, but having long prep lead time is good."
OnePieceTC,3dlj3j,troubled_bison,1 point,Fri Jul 17 11:55:59 2015 UTC,"Doffy is way too far off to prep for if you're talking about global, there's still a long line up before his raid comes (assuming we're following a similar schedule to JP releases) if anything zeph will likely be the next raid if they don't a second iteration of MC Chopper first"
OnePieceTC,3dlj3j,WackyPirates,1 point,Fri Jul 17 11:22:40 2015 UTC,"Yea that's right, but to be honest I don't see much point in farming zephyr or Iakanov(possibly the latter just to power blue units up) and then it's Doffy, it's only 2 months away . Since he completes the Slasher experience I want to MAX units now to farm him in one go :)"
OnePieceTC,3dlj3j,koryuken,1 point,Fri Jul 17 11:54:58 2015 UTC,"Farming Zephyr and/or Ivankov helps to reach Plvl 201 which you'll want if you're planning on farming Doffy.   Ivankov seems ok to me since I own capone, so i can see some use here, especially for blackbeard in a g3 team.  Zephyr helps as some already mentioned if you lack an int burst team and with the shooting type restricted isle. And he's a unit with future potential as he's still used in jp.   As I still need levels for 120stamina both bosses will come in handy. Unfortunately I'm not expecting a double rate for zephyr, so everything depends a little bit on a box expansion - something almost everyone needs desperately."
OnePieceTC,3dmlmw,dobserver,3,Fri Jul 17 14:25:57 2015 UTC,"Don't evolve wb until you can afford his cost with other good units and gp usopp. For the rainbow gems, I would save them for sugofest and I heard wb's skill books are coming a couple more fortnight down the road, so use them there."
OnePieceTC,3dmlmw,pakxmanx21,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:45:05 2015 UTC,"I recommend saving WB, maybe focus on leveling up and try to up the cost, i'm guessing you have Luffy, so you could go do the story missions to level, 0.5x stamina is perfect for leveling. Try to get into the story with Luffy as far as you can, use decently stated fillers you get along the way, level up so you can use Whitebeard!"
OnePieceTC,3dmlmw,masashi23,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:38:40 2015 UTC,"Level all of your named units evenly at first (White Beard, Luffy, Zoro, Usopp, Sanji, Nami, and whatever else drops for you) and just build teams based off of color until you have a cost high enough to put White Beard as the lead with your 4 strongest.  For example:  Luffy lead with red (STR) characters would be one team, Zoro lead with green (DEX) characters would be another, Sanji lead with blue (QCK) characters a third, and so on until you have 1 team of each color, throwing in Usopp and your strongest characters of a different color when you run out of that 1 color.  Then for your 6th team, use White Beard as a lead and just fill in your strongest characters until your cost cap is reached.  Don't use that team until you're able to fit 4 characters in and once you do you'll be set."
OnePieceTC,3dmlmw,Kinnikufan,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:49:30 2015 UTC,farm for Arlong  and u'll be set
OnePieceTC,3dmlmw,LostTrooper,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:11:15 2015 UTC,Thanks all for the advice =)  Will try to start farming and lvling up for now!
OnePieceTC,3dmlmw,burnedcoconut,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:54:13 2015 UTC,Use luffy v1 and farm arlong and alvida
OnePieceTC,3dmlmw,burnedcoconut,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:01:45 2015 UTC,Then would Whitebeard be the captain or luffy v1?
OnePieceTC,3dmlmw,bitereality,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:02:37 2015 UTC,for most of the stuff luffy v1 will be your capt and arlong if you make a slasher team with zoro and kuro. WB is more of a fortnight 30 stam and boss raid captain. his special make him a deadly captain but its not really practical for fast clear
OnePieceTC,3dmlmw,TiggerTheTiger1999,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:07:25 2015 UTC,"wb is the long con, you'll have a weak start but by the time you are really able to bring him to play his value will shine. Why its lucky if you roll wb with a good captain like g3, killer, arlong etc. They'll help with the early struggle. I pulled wb and arlong. My wb was at lv 5 for most of my early start. Just make sure your team is strong enough and you have at least 60 stamina pool by the time kraken island comes and begin saving those gems if you are a f2p so you can farm those wb skill books.   Hope you know leave nami at mirage tempo nami, usopp at gp usopp and dont put levels in tashigi. goodluck"

OnePieceTC,3dnccx,gianmk11,2,Fri Jul 17 17:55:20 2015 UTC,Try to keep only 2-3 max of each type of evo char excluding the seahorses. Also you'll likely find yourself pushing the limit multiple times so you might as well expand your box to the 200 limit.

For instance, I am hoarding evolution materials for Lucci, Kaku, Ain, Zephyr, and Crocodile right now.  Also, keep all lobsters up to maybe 8 per color, especially purple.  8 might seem like overkill, but you don't want to have to farm them when you rare recruit someone that needs one.  EDIT:  Wanted to add that dragons should probably be kept as well.  And I see that you don't have lobsters at the moment, but when you do get them, keep them."

OnePieceTC,3dmef5,NeroSero,3,Fri Jul 17 13:22:37 2015 UTC,"Here are some general tips for you that you may or may not know: Some very strong and useful units that are almost essential or lets say extremely useful are for example Hammer Usopp, Arlong and Princess Vivi or Laboon wich you can all get from the story. DONT evolve you Usopp futher than he already is just max his lvl (Hammer Usopp, the other one is pretty useful for psy team so dont sell him like i did ;_;). Try to always farm turtles on turle time, you can look the times up on this site http://op-tc-eng-version.blogspot.com.au/?m=1 it is rather interesting and very helpful from time to time. Another good tip and i swear, it really is very important even though it just seems like a rather unnecesary thing to do but, get one or two decent teams together wich you can switch between if one if those teams cant defeat a boss or stage in the story (or try to get a good psy team, those have a pretty high chance to beat any enemy you will encounter in the story) and after you got that, SAVE YOUR GEMS FOR SUGOFESTS, still use em for filling you stamina and pull some rare recruits to get those decent teams but you shouldnt use them for a rare recrut as soon as you get them and same goes for your friend points wait until you can get turtles or something useful. Its pretty hard to write so much on the phonebut if you need anything else and just ask. I hope that helped you somehow :)"

OnePieceTC,3dknnt,rafilfc,2,Fri Jul 17 01:14:44 2015 UTC,"just curious, what mission do you need an extra copy of mihawk for?"
OnePieceTC,3dknnt,daveedthelee,3,Fri Jul 17 02:59:24 2015 UTC,"The mission for orange town. It will be the mission that grants you 3 gems. In the Jpn ver, when the mission first introduced the Mihawk has to be your own. But later on they reduce the difficulty and makes it so a friend Mihawk could work as well.  Also in case you are interested, the mission requires you to use Mihawk as captain but limit your cost to 49 (iirc). This is impossible to do with evolved Mihawk which is why you need his base form."
OnePieceTC,3dknnt,rubbertrain12,2,Fri Jul 17 03:20:05 2015 UTC,thanks!
OnePieceTC,3dknnt,daveedthelee,1 point,Fri Jul 17 04:06:37 2015 UTC,"Wait a minute, you can just use a friend captain mihawk then? No need to keep a base form one then, right?"
OnePieceTC,3dknnt,Gyissan,1 point,Fri Jul 17 06:38:03 2015 UTC,That is right. That's how I got my 3 gems in Japan for previous Sugo. No need for you to have one.  But if we'll get a box increase sometime in the future (which is looking very unlikely by the day XD). It is not a bad idea to keep a base Mihawk because some forthnight island has cost limitation and may help with some of the ranking stuff.
OnePieceTC,3dknnt,rubbertrain12,2,Fri Jul 17 08:58:07 2015 UTC,"Good for you. I had to use 30 gems to max my Mihawks. Also, it took me about 20 Mihawks for the last level. I got 1 gem left and barely got his special maxed (just before his island expires). But hey, at least I got his special maxed!! :D"

OnePieceTC,3dnh8z,KSmoria,0,Fri Jul 17 18:36:56 2015 UTC,Generally maxing Mihawk matters more than some random pulls. Try to save some gems for next time.
OnePieceTC,3dnh8z,KSmoria,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:42:45 2015 UTC,"Generally. But as a F2P player with not very many good characters or gems I decided to try for Sugo rather than grind for maybe like 20 copies and getting maybe 2-3 Special Level ups. I feel like grinding Raid bosses for such things is a luxury I didn't have, especially with a Vivi team."
OnePieceTC,3dnh8z,BlueDaruma,3,Fri Jul 17 18:45:27 2015 UTC,I am f2p too and I don't see it like that. Mihawk is the strongest leader you can have right now and for a long time.

Sure he's one of the best characters in the game, but I like a bit of variety. Same goes for farming him, and other raid bosses for that matter, ESPECIALLY if you have no choice but to use Vivi.  My thoughts anyway."

OnePieceTC,3dlw1k,refiasgna,4,Fri Jul 17 09:28:49 2015 UTC,"Personally, I would go for your secondary account; it has more potential for different teams (and WB is a huge +). Did you list all your RR/Fortnight characters? If so, then I would lean more into your second account because of the potential/unused Rainbow Gem. You also have to take into account if you're willing to sacrifice the time and money(?) you put into your first account (that is, if you're planning on keeping one)."
OnePieceTC,3dlw1k,Great_White_Snail,3,Fri Jul 17 09:45:17 2015 UTC,"First account I have all fortnight caracters plus mihawk max special. Second account only mihawk.  I agree with you if you only look at the characters seconday account has more potential. Plus Kidd WB and Aokiji will make me an excelent striker team. However, the level difference and the good level up farmable charactes is what makes me doubt."
OnePieceTC,3dlw1k,PrimalOPTC,3,Fri Jul 17 09:50:11 2015 UTC,its really up to u then. if u highly want that striker team (which i could understand coz they are cool as fuck) i would go for 2nd acc. if u are okay with g3 + everything that is neccessary to clear stage / raid boss etc. stick with first one
OnePieceTC,3dlw1k,Great_White_Snail,2,Fri Jul 17 09:54:04 2015 UTC,"Oh, so I'm assuming you spent $$ on your first account. Max special Mihawk is great too, but at the same time, farmable characters can only get you so far. You can also keep BOTH accounts for now and decide what you keep depending on what you get on the next sugofest.  Edit: Max special Mihawk is a HUGE +++, I'd say almost equal when compared to WB."
OnePieceTC,3dlw1k,MahPhoenix,3,Fri Jul 17 09:54:40 2015 UTC,I didn't spend money in any account. All gems were free. I just saved the gems for the right time. I think I will continue with the 2 accounts and see which one develops better. Thanks for the adivce :D

OnePieceTC,3dm777,bitereality,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:04:14 2015 UTC,"nice box. You should be able to farm zeph. If you can then, look into farming zephs special for making a purely farmable zeph int burst team that works better than tnami robin and will allow you farm garp when he returns. Unless you already have his special cd maxed or low. I can send the reddit post link if you interested. Farming zeph special for a shooter team isnt ideal right now in global but for an int burst team it is.  Evolve kuro b4 tashigi, lucci is already here and will bench her.  Though you dont have law, there will be people using him as captain for lucci isle so you'll still get use out of him  goodluck  After lucci is franky isle so when your dex team is strong enough to take on 30 stamina lucci start planning for that"
OnePieceTC,3dm777,bitereality,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:30:33 2015 UTC,"Using a Law friend captain to pair with Apoo is exactly what I am planning to do for Lucci, thanks for confirming that it's a good idea :)  I am intrigued about Zephyr though, I thought his special boosts Shooter types only, so how would he be viable for an INT burst team?  Also, if I may ask what's so great about Kuro, isn't Lucci a better slasher than both him and Tashigi? Or is he just to keep as an extra QCK sub as I don't have many of those at the moment?  Thanks a lot!"
OnePieceTC,3dm777,bitereality,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:47:44 2015 UTC,"Yes, he boosts shooter types only which for global isnt really worth farming his special right now, but since tnami robin int burst teams take broggy, bazooka purple marine/buggy and coby for the 3 guaranteed orbs to burst with, switching out tnami and robin, the 2 gacha units, for zephyr and tsuru, you end up dealing more burst damage with same levels and blowing the namirobin damage out of the water with 2 turns comparison. Plus you have more health  Well heres the link to the reddit post with the break down  https://zy.reddit.com/r/OnePieceTC/comments/3d5cli/zephyr_int_team_with_only_farmable_units_bursts/  If you already have robin and tnami then theres no need for this or if you have robin and vista. But if you only have one of these 3 then might be better spending the gems farming zeph than trying your luck at pulls. my thinking anyway.  Lucci is the better slasher, stats and special, just for the extra quick sub as you said. So definitely focus on lucci and kaku first, then kuro. Slasher teams taking on chopper"
OnePieceTC,3dm777,bitereality,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:00:51 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the link and the thorough analysis, I am considering this now. I think I'll start farming Broggy and if he drops I'll definitely go for farming Zephyr's special :)"
OnePieceTC,3dl6vz,monkeydalby,1 point,Fri Jul 17 04:09:36 2015 UTC,"It means the orb effect is increased by 1.5x each turn for a total of 2 turns, hence the 2 x 1.5 = 3. It's similar to V2 coby's special.  Note that this special has no effect on neutral orbs. It can also decrease your damage further if you have a mismatching orb."
OnePieceTC,3dl6vz,Bacon_Steak,2,Fri Jul 17 04:26:04 2015 UTC,"listing it as 3x is a big mistake by itself, since you're not getting the same orbs the following turns unless you lock the orbs.  also the blog is lazy and wrong as usual, ""Reversive for opposite Orbs."" wtf is that explanation, must be too hard to write ""1.5x for strong orbs  and 0.66x for weak orbs for 2 turns""."

OnePieceTC,3dkc7c,Kinnikufan,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:59:58 2015 UTC,3 million is needed to max 4* smoker so you probably need less depending on his current level (have him at lv81 still need 1.4million to 99). Maybe you catch a x2 sucess and need less. Go for it!! :D

OnePieceTC,3dl737,Curryriceandpeas,2,Fri Jul 17 04:11:36 2015 UTC,No because you can't trade. What? Honestly because of all the RNG we can't determine what would be great for you to do. Some peopleare lucky enough after a few of the island they can go pwn the crap out of the special island events but others need much more time.   I'll give you a piece of advice though : Save the gems/devil fruits for sugofest.
OnePieceTC,3dl737,AlexandriaTheGreatz,1 point,Fri Jul 17 04:18:04 2015 UTC,"To add on to this, for #2 - If you're farming for someone, anyone, you keep running the stage they are on and defeating them. I believe the drop rates for everyone is 2% so if you defeat the person and see a wanted poster pop up over them, that means you got them.  As for saving gems for Sugofest, absolutely, the only other thing you should spend gems on is expanding your character box if you need to."

OnePieceTC,3dl737,Walawalawolf,1 point,Fri Jul 17 04:30:10 2015 UTC,"No, characters are account specific. You can't transfer them between accounts. Farming a character will drop the lowest rarity of their poster (silver). In Usopps case he would drop the same version you get from the story mode. Fortnights and raid bosses have the best experience/stamina ratio. Also progressing through the story will get you through the early levels quickly."
OnePieceTC,3dl737,branstanman,1 point,Fri Jul 17 04:21:11 2015 UTC,"Few questions from a new player as well:   What is barrel breaking? I assume the fortnight islands are event islands where you can farm certain chars? Is that correct? When Im fighting, theres this flash flash on some of the chars. What is that?   Thanks!"
OnePieceTC,3dl737,Cubed1437,1 point,Fri Jul 17 04:51:30 2015 UTC,"1 You can only take advantage of barrel breaking if you have a friend with the game or through the help of a 'fake gps' app on your phone.  You tap a barrel and get free stuff once from up to five other players per week.  It is also the only way you get keys for the special island which requires them.   Fortnight islands are more than just for farming specific characters, while thinking of them as 'mini raids' they can also drop character specific skill books which can increase that characters' special ability, lowering its cooldown by 1 turn usually. This 'flash flash' is likely the attacking words you are seeing.  Each character attacks in a different way using different 'words' and the words have no influence on the game unless aesthetically."
OnePieceTC,3dl737,RiskyR,1 point,Fri Jul 17 06:21:09 2015 UTC,"Nope. Sorry. Characters in one account stay in one account. It is, but sometimes that's the best way to acquire characters without having to use gems. Some of the best characters in the game can be obtained in this way, but the drop rates are atrocious, hence why you often see people referring to them as ""farmable"". You always get the lowest rarity of a character if they drop, rarity ranking from bronze (2 star) to gold (4 or 5 star). Fortnights and the Raidbosses will have the biggest XP to stamina ratio in general. That aside, also try to level up your characters constantly, as they're what will ultimately carry you through the more difficult isles. There are the weekly turtle isles that are incredibly useful for leveling up your characters quickly. You can check here as to where turtles will appear.   Hope that helps!"

I also got my ass kicked by Heracles, but did manage to recruit Fat Usopp for my character box. I fed 1 Mihawk and got a skillup. And I leveled my rerolled Rayleigh account up a lot. Today was a pretty good OPTC day for me too."

I finally managed to max Mihawk after 13 gems (was already on level 6 before I started). Did two yolo pulls soon after and got Chu. Guess it didn't take too long for my luck to run out... but hey. Can't exactly complain.  I added you btw. I seem to see you around a lot on the threads, and it's nice to see a fellow collector ;)"

I feel like I could have gotten mine there if he had come on the weekend, but I'll just get him next time.  Still gotta work out a team to get his ship anyway before my Slasher team is truly prepared.  Too bad about the YOLO pulls though.  It feels like they mostly end badly and yet everyone still does them (myself included), but oh well.  After these last few Sugofests the collection isn't looking quite as nice as I'd like, but I'm going to keep at it!"

OnePieceTC,3dhlps,VictoryAkara,4,Thu Jul 16 15:54:42 2015 UTC,"Bandai must be loaded. I wonder how much money they waste responding to these requests when they have so many simple options.  They might have their own reasons for not using cloud-based or linked-accounts, but the simplest change is to just increase the duration of passwords. To 14 days or something. Heck, make it permanent until reissued. I don't get the point of 7-day passwords if they didn't want us to transfer accounts to other people...unless it's a method to delete unused user ID's? Shrug. Feels rather inefficient..."

I don't have a developed INT team so I was going to go Vivi/SW Sanji or LS Zoro but gamewith recommends bringing Sengoku for his active.

OnePieceTC,3di6cl,WanderingWasabi,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:29:55 2015 UTC,"You can't beat him with a Vivi team, since he heals every 2 turns or when he is low. I don't know the range of Sengoku's damage. But I would guess it is in between 50-150k."
OnePieceTC,3di6cl,WanderingWasabi,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:40:24 2015 UTC,Gamewith has a suggested vivi team + LS Zoro. The idea is you can burst down his last 20% HP using people's skills. I wanted to get an idea to see if sengoku is an important piece in the team or if he could be replaced with someone else.

It could have been 6 but I got nothing from the 30 stamina the one time I ran it. I decided to save one of the Mihawks for the future mission everyone is talking about so I only fed 3 of them to one Mihawk all at once and I actually got 3 skillups! 3/3!

OnePieceTC,3dkkk3,iamdbest24,5,Fri Jul 17 00:47:40 2015 UTC,"You've got some really nice units in there (Law+Apoo combo, Vista+Robin team), congratulations on that!  I see you've evolved your Nami into Mirage Tempo, this was the correct choice, and most importantly leave her as Mirage Tempo due to her niche special ability. The final evolution is of no use to you, as you've already got a much better Int captain in Vista, and you'd lose Mirage's unique special.  I'll just stress the fact that you don't have to worry about not clearing the story mode islands immediately, they'll always be around. Rather, focus on the fortnight islands (currently Khalifa) and make sure you recruit both the units that drop from there (Khalifa and Paulie) before the opportunity passes.  General tips include paying attention to when turtles arrive on Mondays (see http://cyung.github.io/optc/ ) and powering up your units accordingly. Good luck!"
OnePieceTC,3dkkk3,Tvingman,2,Fri Jul 17 01:12:02 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I've been straying away from doing the 15 Stamina Khalifa since I think I dont have good Str characters but I'll give it a shot and try to get one or both of them if RNG is on my side"
OnePieceTC,3dkkk3,Tvingman,2,Fri Jul 17 01:25:41 2015 UTC,"They can both drop in all difficulties, so if 15 isn't an option, do the 10 stam! As long as you get a copy of each before the island changes."

OnePieceTC,3dkkk3,TheEmperor1k,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:50:44 2015 UTC,"You should have joined this subreddit a little earlier... You already made a mistake by not evolving Usopp into GP Usopp. That mistake could be potential game changer in future as extra 5 turns are huge. It's going to be a pain to farm him, so my suggestion is, just reroll for a G3 or Balloon Luffy, and go from there. You are only level 38 so it's still pretty early and easy to catch up."

OnePieceTC,3djheg,patrykgam,3,Thu Jul 16 23:30:11 2015 UTC,"Maybe a bit of statistics will make you feel better?  The rate is roughly about 1 skill up in 5 (20% success rate), you're getting 1 skill up in about 7 (13% success rate). Put as numbers it doesn't sound that bad right?  You just got extremely lucky at first and Bandai made sure you paid the price later on."
OnePieceTC,3djheg,erdbeer_sahne,0,Thu Jul 16 19:48:42 2015 UTC,Where did you get the 20% success rate from?  Someone else on here said that it was 25%.

We all made some mistakes when we started as I sold my Usopp. I'm pretty sure you know about this game as much as most of us so I guess my only suggestion would be: always save gems for emergency use, you want to max out Mihawk with G3 in your hands during the skill ups, man."

OnePieceTC,3dhc99,bananafish707,3,Thu Jul 16 09:19:55 2015 UTC,CP9 Lucci is a strength fighter while. Fortnight is a quick slasher. Different special and captain skill as well

OnePieceTC,3djsfl,Byronlove9,7,Thu Jul 16 21:02:27 2015 UTC,"All cooldown reductions, Sengoku, Duval, the ship, ect. only apply to the start of the stage.  First use only.  Past that, as has been mentioned, you can't apply a second buff or debuff of the same type.  You can't delay a delayed enemy, you can't poison a poisoned enemy, you can't reduce the defense of an enemy who has had their defense reduced."
OnePieceTC,3djsfl,Hypnotist-Nick,3,Thu Jul 16 21:48:22 2015 UTC,"2 questions: GP usopp is not blue, would he have his CD reduced?  and is double ""cd reducers"" just added like that?  Anyway, you cant perma delay you would have to take a hit every time for a new delay   edit: and no, even if everything adds, it would still be reduce only 3, so he would have a CD of 7 (1 for each doma and 1 for kuros boat)"
OnePieceTC,3djsfl,tadabola,5,Thu Jul 16 21:21:24 2015 UTC,4 star Doma reduces cd by 1 but 5 star reduces cd by 3
OnePieceTC,3djsfl,TheRob1001,5,Thu Jul 16 21:30:01 2015 UTC,I think that the cd is just reduced once in the beginning or am I wrong?
OnePieceTC,3djsfl,Reispirat,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:43:34 2015 UTC,doma reduces cd by 3
OnePieceTC,3djsfl,tadabola,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:28:26 2015 UTC,wow many people corrected me. Now I want him when he comes to global :P
OnePieceTC,3djsfl,TheRob1001,-1,Thu Jul 16 23:29:48 2015 UTC,perma is real. if u use in a enemy minimum he would have 1 turn before attack. when is come to 1 again special would be up again. And y gp special would be reduced. say reduce all cd by 1 at start of a stage
OnePieceTC,3djsfl,Crimples,2,Thu Jul 16 21:25:30 2015 UTC,you can't delay them again when they are still in a delay state (little clock icon next to them)
OnePieceTC,3djsfl,montblancnoland,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:32:12 2015 UTC,oh i see thx
OnePieceTC,3djsfl,TheEmperor1k,2,Thu Jul 16 21:34:50 2015 UTC,"You can't chain turn delays. For example, if you use GP Usopp on Mihawk, Mihawk can't attack until 4 turns. If you attempt to use Mr.3's special, you'll be unable to activate it until the delay debuff from GP Usopp goes away and after Mihawk attacks once.  GP Ussop > 3 turn delay > Enemy Attacks > Mr.3 > 1 turn delay"
OnePieceTC,3dgks5,xTimelined,7,Thu Jul 16 02:40:12 2015 UTC,i agree it should be an obvious implementation to the subreddit. half of the converters out there are wrong anyway and ignore pst for pt/ptd  its not really a matter of math skills.. just convenience
OnePieceTC,3dgks5,drawpthebase,3,Thu Jul 16 02:46:59 2015 UTC,100% agree with you. Just allows for 0 room for error at least in regards to when X event will start

OnePieceTC,3djc4u,alec613,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:24:07 2015 UTC,I got like three on one stage the day they released drum kingdom
OnePieceTC,3djc4u,Oedipustrexeliot,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:38:10 2015 UTC,"It took a long time and a few gems for me to get one to drop, too.  All I can really suggest is to keep running Drum Island 3 during a 2x Drop Rate or 1/2 Stamina period (1/2 Stam lets you run through twice as much, so you have a little bit less chance than Drop days, but still better than normal) using a team that can sweep them quickly.  Overall, the unit itself is fairly lackluster, the RCV stat doesn't give enough to justify using it's Light Healing special (even evolved and at max level, it only has 100 RCV), and it's Captain Skill is a generic 1.5x boost. I suggest evolving one for it's listing, then feed it to another unit - it's not really woth the effort."

OnePieceTC,3did9s,itspabo,2,Thu Jul 16 14:48:43 2015 UTC,"Are you taking 3 units that can easily score perfects?  I use double G3, Arlong, Alvida, Usopp, and Smoker.  I don't even get the chance to use Smoker or Alvida's specials, but they are easy to hit perfects with and the first 3 characters deal negligible damage anyway.  It takes a lot of stress away when you don't have to worry so much about missing."
OnePieceTC,3did9s,Kinnikufan,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:18:14 2015 UTC,I'm running the same team (Whitebeard instead of Smoker) with the final hit being Whitebeard as he's somewhat harder than the others to hit perfect on but I completely agree. Usopp then alvida for an easy start then G3 or Arlong works for me. For farming a couple of less useful but easy to hit perfect units take the stress right out of it.   At the moment farming Mihawk is easier for me than Kalifa 30 stamina due to the units I'm using.
OnePieceTC,3did9s,VRip0,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:46:09 2015 UTC,"Same with me.  Khalifa 30 isn't particularly hard, but I have to sub in Momoo and Morgan, who has a surprisingly slow attack that occasionally screws me up.  I can usually hit perfects with G3 and Arlong, too, but in important situations I prefer the safest route."

OnePieceTC,3did9s,Raichin,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:10:44 2015 UTC,"Damn, you want to know what is worse than that? Not having the  penguin multi-color to evolve Mihawk. Once he reaches level 70, I'm doomed. Also 10 copies, no skill-up. No luck."
OnePieceTC,3did9s,Kaikrox,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:15:53 2015 UTC,Sure would be nice if we could trade units in this game...

OnePieceTC,3did9s,Kaikrox,6,Thu Jul 16 15:25:20 2015 UTC,"If you have the space for it, do that.  If you don't, then bite the bullet and keep fusing.  A level 70 unevolved Mihawk with a maxed special will go a long way when you finally get that last evolver.  Experience is relatively easy to come by, box space and skill levels aren't."

OnePieceTC,3did9s,Magic-Man2,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:37:19 2015 UTC,"For those 5 percent where you can't stall for Usopp, I've noticed this: first turn you should be able to stall for minimal 2 with their cool downs, second turn the lowest I've seen is 4 for cool downs, but lets say 3, third turn if you hit the penguin with only usopp you can stall for 6 turns plus the preemptive strike from the marine counts as a turn so make that 7 turns, fourth stage only 1 turn, and on Mihawk stage you get 1 turn for his preemptive1 attack. So in all worst case scenarios, you can stall for minimally 14 turns, and mostly likely you can easily get to 15 turns because the turtle stage will probably give you 4 turns. Hope that helps a bit!"

OnePieceTC,3dhwoy,Francesco1991,1 point,Thu Jul 16 12:18:56 2015 UTC,Nice! I took 35 copies to max :) Wasted a gem or two on bad runs haha
OnePieceTC,3dhwoy,Gahlokneo,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:45:35 2015 UTC,Congrats! Took me a more because i got 2 ups out of the first 18 copies :D
OnePieceTC,3dhwoy,Gahlokneo,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:55:37 2015 UTC,Oof. I feel you. I saved 15 alvida books for this 2x event and got 2 skill ups. RNG is not kind.
OnePieceTC,3dhwoy,Levkko,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:11:26 2015 UTC,I'm already on 56 copies and at level 13 skill up not to mention the 20 something copies that gave me zero skillups when mihawk first came out...
OnePieceTC,3dimlp,johngriffisgod,5,Thu Jul 16 15:58:39 2015 UTC,It should be released on the 21st. The lucci island is delayed 4 hours most likely due to maintenance.
OnePieceTC,3dimlp,vashnite,6,Thu Jul 16 17:35:24 2015 UTC,The difference between knowing about Mihawk and a story island is that the server has to go into maintenance for 4+ hours to add the story island to the game so no amount of setting our device's clock forward will tell us. We won't know when until it's in the announcements section.
OnePieceTC,3dimlp,Devin__,2,Thu Jul 16 16:01:39 2015 UTC,Thanks guy
OnePieceTC,3dimlp,caligari1,2,Thu Jul 16 16:06:40 2015 UTC,"i can say for sure, at least another week, or they wouldve announced a maintance allready."
OnePieceTC,3dimlp,StNowhere,2,Thu Jul 16 16:25:32 2015 UTC,My guess would be last week of July. Any sooner and they would have announced it already.

OnePieceTC,3dgo4c,rafilfc,4,Thu Jul 16 03:09:47 2015 UTC,"My favorite variant is to run MC with a Whitebeard friend.  This way you can run another STR unit and get away with only Mihawk for HP filler.  The preemptive damage activates WB, and then you hit for consistently more damage than a double MC team."

OnePieceTC,3dgo4c,etnanisor,1 point,Thu Jul 16 05:44:50 2015 UTC,Tried this combination (Whitebeard 6* friend/MC/Arlong/Mihawk/Sanji/Usopp). Very good!
OnePieceTC,3dgo4c,xOwNii,2,Thu Jul 16 10:24:13 2015 UTC,"Thanks for that mate, was getting tired of using vivi+laboon.  The team: Friend MC (lv.60+) My MC (lv.61) Arlong (lv.81) Mihawk (lv.70) Jozu (lv.68) GOD Ussopp (lv.46)  Ends up with around 8-9k HP.   Stage 1: Stall as long as the mobs give, usually 2 or 3 turns. Stage 2: Turtles, stall as long as possible usually 3-5 turns. Stage 3: Pre-emptive Marine attack (2202 dmg), Stall on Green Pirate penguin, let him hit you once make the calculation though, Mihawk got pre-emptive of 4k. Stage 4: No stalling here use GOD Ussopp on sea stallion. Stage 5: You should have GOD Ussopp and Jozu's specials ready, Pop Ussopp, if you can't finish him of, pop Jozu aswell."

OnePieceTC,3dgo4c,gvon89,2,Thu Jul 16 10:56:06 2015 UTC,How is that possible with all the pre emptive damage you take?
OnePieceTC,3dgo4c,gvon89,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:18:41 2015 UTC,8000hp to begin with - 6300 pre empt damage - 1000hp to stall on penguin. So have +700 hp left

OnePieceTC,3dgo4c,ghostaudio,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:14:55 2015 UTC,http://imgur.com/BWXSRKA heres my team and ussop is sp lvl 14 I stall until vista is ready which is 15 turns
OnePieceTC,3dgo4c,Ninjafro,0,Thu Jul 16 03:17:41 2015 UTC,A 15 turn stall isn't better than a G3 team though..  If your GPU is max special then 10~13 turns is all you really need to clear 40 stam.
OnePieceTC,3dgo4c,Radioactiveman271,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:49:25 2015 UTC,But double mc is so much safer esp for me as im pretty useless at hitting perfects under pressure.
OnePieceTC,3dgo4c,ghostaudio,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:08:15 2015 UTC,"Haha!  I remember when I felt the same way. If you're really struggling you can throw in some characters with very easy hit animations. GPU has an easy hit animation, Alvida has an easy hit animation and Smoker has a nice and slow hit animation too!  Are you running 30 stam or 40 stam"
OnePieceTC,3dgo4c,Reibus,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:46:10 2015 UTC,With these levels I think he can do 40 stamina easily as long as he stalls for Usopp
OnePieceTC,3dgo4c,FellatioRex,1 point,Thu Jul 16 11:22:48 2015 UTC,Alvida and Gear 2nd Luffy are the two animations I always fuck up. It's weird and super frustrating because missing those makes me miss all of my damage that turn.
OnePieceTC,3dgo4c,OddSensation,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:40:58 2015 UTC,"G2 I can understand, it may need practicing on the 0 stam isle. But Alvida's animation is so easy.. really slow. Just give it some practice."

OnePieceTC,3dgo4c,juyal,1 point,Thu Jul 16 05:22:08 2015 UTC,If you have max merry G3 is very easy. Only 2 turns are required and you have 5 turns with ussopp+alvida.

OnePieceTC,3dihpw,Kinnikufan,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:26:11 2015 UTC,V2 zoro in its first form negates a STR attack. So if you pull him I recommend not to evolve him unless you have 2 copies.

As I was approaching maxed skill, I decided to wait about 40 min and used 20 stam on blue dragon dungeon.

OnePieceTC,3dic3g,PhantomBaselard,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:50:34 2015 UTC,"I'm sure you mean Vivi/Laboon.  The goal is to take 4 characters with high attack, low HP and just power through it.  Just remember while building the team to keep the total crew HP (including ship and friend, which aren't added on the ""Edit Crew"" screen) is less than Vivi's recovery stat x10 (she heals x5 every turn and your HP needs to be above half for Laboon, so x10 to make sure you always heal at least half).  EDIT:  I have been set straight and now know that I was mistaken and you did mean Khalifa.  For Khalifa, make sure your team's HP is no more than 1000 if she is unevolved and no more than 2000 if she is evolved.  Otherwise, pretty much the same as I said earlier.  Try loading up on Lobsters and Crabs."

OnePieceTC,3dfwzu,Azzac96,0,Thu Jul 16 01:17:26 2015 UTC,"too much money on RR pulls, maxing chars and being plvl 200 doesn't take much though. You just can't do both without spending a bit and/or being super lucky. I probably put ~20-30 hours into a fortnight while it's available, and don't gem stam when I'm done maxing SPLV."

OnePieceTC,3dfize,beardedheathen,6,Wed Jul 15 22:55:33 2015 UTC,you have a guaranteed red orb for kid with a 50 % damage boost for 2 turns. this should be enough and I think that the calculator doesn't include the bonus damage. with specials: Imgur
OnePieceTC,3dfize,qmznkrv,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:05:36 2015 UTC,has this been tested?   Edit: just tested as wow awesome. I used tony tony chopper instead of Gaimon but didn't need his meat because I used Marco instead of Tsuro. I also have gp usopp at 11 turns so I used him twice on the penguin. Killed Mihawk in two turns with 79 Arlong and an orb.
OnePieceTC,3dfize,beardedheathen,2,Thu Jul 16 04:03:32 2015 UTC,"I've been testing variations on the theme. My favorite so far is Mihawk x2, Usopp, Arlong, Morgan, and a Marine Pistol Ensign at MAX Special Level. Morgan splits the orb luck across two characters. The Ensign attacks a little faster than Gaimon, and he heals for over 1000 HP at level 30. I've hit Mihawk with max HP more than a few times, not that it really matters.  My friend is using the original post's Mihawk x2, Usopp, Arlong, Alvida, Gaimon, and having very few problems, because Alvida provides an extra turn of damage when used on round 1 of Mihawk.  Not sure why buttofcause switched Alvida to Tsuru. I'd rather have the extra round against Mihawk instead of the easy healing."
OnePieceTC,3dfize,qmznkrv,2,Thu Jul 16 05:19:02 2015 UTC,I've got to try this cause I just failed twice with rotten orb luck. A bad orb on arlong twice and once on Mihawk and no plus orbs D:
OnePieceTC,3dfize,beardedheathen,2,Thu Jul 16 07:21:14 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's really rough when the bad orbs land, or when the chain is dropped right before Arlong. And like most raid teams, it gets even more dangerous without a MAXed Going Merry.  Still, I'd rather spend an extra gem or two than have to go back to Vivi/Laboon. Bleh."
OnePieceTC,3dfize,FellatioRex,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:34:41 2015 UTC,For sure. I need to practice with Morgan cause his attack is so slow comparatively and it makes it hard to land a perfect. but the pistol ensign is brilliant. I only had a couple gems but managed to get 5 Mihawks and one skill up. Woo
OnePieceTC,3dfize,FellatioRex,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:04:22 2015 UTC,Don't we only have 4 turns to kill him with GP usopp special and not 5?
OnePieceTC,3dfize,Lawce,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:42:36 2015 UTC,GP usopp and Alvida :)  EDIT : Also edited the main post. thank you ! :D
OnePieceTC,3dfize,Ironman2131,3,Wed Jul 15 21:46:29 2015 UTC,"Ah ok, forgot about Alvida.  I'm planning on using Jozu so I know I have 5 turns, just wasn't sure for everyone else."
OnePieceTC,3dfize,Lawce,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:47:46 2015 UTC,yeah jozu is really helpful vs mihawk :D

OnePieceTC,3dfize,Kaikrox,2,Wed Jul 15 21:53:04 2015 UTC,"I'm leaning towards a Chopper team as well.  I'll test other teams, like G3, but my gut is that Chopper is the best combination of risk and speed.  I can use those same members on one account, but I'll probably stick with Mihawk and Smoker on the other (since I have max Smoker special)."
OnePieceTC,3dfize,Kaikrox,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:51:23 2015 UTC,The only concern is stalling for usopp's special and having the hp to tank 2x pre emptives. If you can manage that then you're golden :)

Your best bet (I'm not 100% on this, you might even need to gem) would be G2 Captain, G3 Friend Captain, Alvida, Morgan, Arlong & GP Usopp. Run this team with Merry.

OnePieceTC,3dfize,ghostaudio,1 point,Thu Jul 16 09:59:52 2015 UTC,"Depends on if you can hit your perfects really.  I prefer the team with Morgan in it.  With Alvida there you already have 5 turns to kill Mihawk. Honestly if you can't do it in 5 turns you probably deserve to fail, but I digress.  My vote is for the team with Morgan in it for more damage. You CAN run Jozu if you want. Like you said, both teams are solid and can clear both 30/40 stam versions."

OnePieceTC,3dfize,ghostaudio,1 point,Thu Jul 16 05:44:11 2015 UTC,40 stam. have you tried the damage calculator to see your damage? :)
OnePieceTC,3dfize,hacdladf1,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:51:25 2015 UTC,"My team right now is G3+friend g3, Arlong (evolution), GP usopp, who else should I bring? Was thinking Coby for quicker finish and maybe Morgan cuz he has a bit higher stats than alvida (won't really be needing her since I has GP usopp and can get mihawk down in 2 turns or so). But if alvida is still a better option than Morgan, will take her. Thanks for advice :)."
OnePieceTC,3dfize,ThirdSlipper,1 point,Thu Jul 16 11:20:55 2015 UTC,Alvida is a much better option because she gives you 1 extra turn to kill mihawk

OnePieceTC,3dfize,drz_flyest13,2,Thu Jul 16 08:13:13 2015 UTC,Only about the hp on the units.  Only the Elder Seahorse has 6HP where as the rest of the mobs are all 4 HP units. What you are incorrect is about which units bind. Only the elder seahorse binds (random bind) and the int shooter unit binds psy units.

If they are on my favorites I give them around 1.5+ weeks. I don't discriminate on Plv either as long as he/she is active, so if your friends added you then I doubt they will delete you if you use another lead. I recommend only adding friends you will need btw (I'm reserving my extra friend slots for future leads atm since I have enough friends to use to supply all my teams)."
OnePieceTC,3dhymo,bitereality,2,Thu Jul 16 14:40:50 2015 UTC,"tips, when you get to higher player level friends, they play more and will be available more often when you go to options scroll to the bottom and tap back to main menu.  If you are being deleted besides the captain you are using, it might mean you have long gaps inbetween play. I usually arrange my friend list by time and remove people who havent logged in for 3 days. Some do less.  Even when you dont have stamina just go to the training forest, start a run, the quit the run, it refreshes your captain for your friends. Not sure if theres an easier way to do this.   When you use your int team and you know most on your list are mihawk captains, just go to your edit crew and swipe back to your mihawk. When your friends refresh they'll see your mihawk even though your last run was with nami.  Hope that helps, if there are any mistakes any correctons appreciated"
OnePieceTC,3dhymo,Tvingman,2,Thu Jul 16 15:19:14 2015 UTC,"Many of us are in the same boat. Typically half my friend list switches to whatever's required for the current fortnight/boss (so right now there's an abundance of Monster Choppers and Blamencos).  So what if a portion of the friend list are running something that is not Kalifa's island? You've (hopefully) got 50 others with appropriate captains. I wouldn't start deleting people unless they show up as not having logged in for 5 days, consistently using weird captains etc. :]"

OnePieceTC,3dhw29,Kaladin77,1 point,Thu Jul 16 12:43:29 2015 UTC,Unlucky. I just started farming him. Had 2 copies. Did 1 at a time and got a special level up each time.

OnePieceTC,3dhw29,HelplessKid,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:21:15 2015 UTC,Even one level up can mean a huge difference. I can't tell you how many times I stalled 30 turns on Tsuru/Smoker/Hina/Cobymeppo just to end up using his special when the boss was already at ~20% HP.
OnePieceTC,3dhw29,alec613,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:39:16 2015 UTC,"Finally got a skill up after using 3 copies :) Probably just a coincidence but it worked!  Edit: Just did another batch of 3, got super success and 2 skill ups!  Maybe it's not all RNG..."
OnePieceTC,3dhw29,RiskyR,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:49:55 2015 UTC,Tried 5 and 3 at a time and only getting 2 lvl ups with 23 mihawks. Now i am doing 1 and get 1 lvl up every two i fed him alone. Upped my rate to 6 lvlups for 29 mihawks now.

OnePieceTC,3dei2d,Matainer,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:41:14 2015 UTC,"Very true, but considering it took Mihawk three months to come back this time, you may not want to risk it."

Do specials carry over after evolving (never tested it) because if they don't then I'm just gonna keep him unevolved until the missions over and not get a new one for it.
OnePieceTC,3dei2d,MinTef,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:17:57 2015 UTC,Raid boss specials always carry over. If an ability has the same name it carries over.

OnePieceTC,3dgpto,ghostaudio,1 point,Thu Jul 16 05:15:49 2015 UTC,No what I was asking was if OP was unable to clear Mihawk with a double WB team in one turn.   If the levels on his characters are high enough he shouldn't even need Usopp's special.
OnePieceTC,3dgpto,RiskyR,2,Thu Jul 16 05:48:15 2015 UTC,The levels are pretty low so takes 4 turns. I do around 350k damage.

OnePieceTC,3dgna8,jaycee415,3,Thu Jul 16 04:13:09 2015 UTC,You get the free gem and the Hawk title. Might as well do it and then use the gem to refill your stamina. There is a chance of Mihawk dropping in it so it is worth doing once.

OnePieceTC,3degfe,TheRealBlydd,2,Wed Jul 15 17:25:01 2015 UTC,"If we're following the Japanese types and order of Sugofest (like we did in the past) the next Sugofest will contain boosted rates for supernova pt. 2 and Whitebeard pirates.   After that, there was the  christmas Sugofest (I don't know if it will be the same), there were boosted rates for Strawhat V2 (including Robin it seems) and Whitebeard pirates.   A new batch was released with the new year's Sugofest, which contained the Shichibukai. Rates were boosted for Supernova pt. 2 and the Shichibukai.  I don't know if we're following this order, especially if you look at the christmas and new year's sugofest. (Obviously) They were within the same month, only one week between both.  If you're looking for Kidd, there may be more chances to get him with his rate boosted. I think at least one Sugofest will be without a new batch.  Don't rely on this too much, this is based on the Japanese sequence of Sugofests - they could be totally different on global.  I hope this helps."
OnePieceTC,3degfe,TheRealBlydd,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:39:33 2015 UTC,"that did help, thx. So if it were to follow then the next 2 batches brings no new characters but boosted crews? I have no need to pull as this sugofest 200 gems I pulled my missing whitebeard crew izo and supernova pt1 urogue. Only missing is kidd and 2 legends. So i guess pull with the 3rd batch where the shichibukai will be introduced along with boost supernova 2."

In Japan there were two Sugofests in between from what I've read.  If you're interested in more: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLvj1UqnjyWijSgNd_h-b0hriy1ZhF9ake  That's the playlist of GameWith's Sugofest pulls. In the background you'll see the current Sugofest. (You can also try to identify it by looking at the thumbnail because sometimes they skipped the screen. But maybe you're familiar with Japanese.)

OnePieceTC,3dd8g8,youstoopet,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:55:22 2015 UTC,"Same account.. first pull was WB then second pull was gold and I was thinking thatd be so funny if it was Ray, then it was! Now I've got a dilemma though.. my main is plv 140 with many chars including G3 and WB, but it doesnt have both 6*.. guess i'll play this other as a spare for now haha"

OnePieceTC,3dfrev,archevil,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:39:53 2015 UTC,Well of you don't need the Screen grab..  First run Got / Green Turtle / Mihawk.  That's it.  30 Stam.
OnePieceTC,3dfrev,OddSensation,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:23:25 2015 UTC,4 Runs 2 Drops
OnePieceTC,3dfrev,montea,1 point,Thu Jul 16 11:34:39 2015 UTC,I can only run 30 Sta consistently. Locks on 40 Sta mess me up too badly. So here are my runs so far. I'll edit the new ones. Final Edit: That's it for me. Actually screwed up the 19th run. (fml i'm tired). So 7 out of 18; 38%. Am I lucky or no? 1 Special up! hooray!   Drop No drop No drop No drop No drop No drop Drop Drop No Drop No Drop No Drop Drop Drop No Drop No Drop No Drop Drop Drop
OnePieceTC,3dfrev,imoagschloaga,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:31:26 2015 UTC,Its basically 50% its been compiled before
OnePieceTC,3dfrev,dabiont,2,Wed Jul 15 23:07:32 2015 UTC,"can you give me the link?  we have our data too and it's only 75 runs, but it shows 28% or so"
OnePieceTC,3dfrev,dabiont,2,Wed Jul 15 23:10:58 2015 UTC,Mostly word of mouth. But I believe someone from the blog did it. That and the sites ive heard about are all in japaenese.
OnePieceTC,3dc7wh,raistlyn,7,Wed Jul 15 03:24:39 2015 UTC,Nice man! How about the others 119 gems?
OnePieceTC,3dc7wh,Kaikrox,4,Wed Jul 15 03:27:24 2015 UTC,"wasted a few more hoping for kidd, but just for stam refills"
OnePieceTC,3dc7wh,HodorsGroceries,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:37:08 2015 UTC,Is double Rayleigh stronger than everything else other than double whitebeard?
OnePieceTC,3dc7wh,HodorsGroceries,4,Wed Jul 15 04:21:36 2015 UTC,"uh, it's very versatile but does less damage than g3/log/wb. Still able to clear every boss, but some of the teams need ridiculous subs (like WB sub against doffy)"
OnePieceTC,3dc7wh,ShwimmingAway,3,Wed Jul 15 04:41:23 2015 UTC,"Oh ok, well I failed to get Rayleigh... Though I did manage to get all the supernova's along with a Shanks so I'm fine for now I guess. Plus Mihawk's on the way so I'm set because I love my slasher's!!!"
OnePieceTC,3dc7wh,FellatioRex,3,Wed Jul 15 13:50:43 2015 UTC,slashers 4 lyfe
OnePieceTC,3dc7wh,ShwimmingAway,-4,Wed Jul 15 16:55:29 2015 UTC,"Double Rayleigh is more useful and, if we're being honest, practical than dual WB. Rayleigh can clear every raidboss so far, WB can't, AND you're less likely to die"
OnePieceTC,3dc7wh,RoyNizuka,4,Wed Jul 15 04:27:17 2015 UTC,"You have it backwards, WB teams can clear almost every raid boss while Rayleigh has trouble with most.  Rayleigh teams are slightly weaker to G3 teams and work very similarly but have a more constant kind of DPS"
OnePieceTC,3dc7wh,RoyNizuka,-2,Wed Jul 15 04:43:05 2015 UTC,No I don't. To date only Rayleigh and Log Luffy teams can clear every single raid boss. Look it up
OnePieceTC,3dc7wh,chairmanedz,5,Wed Jul 15 08:09:49 2015 UTC,"Congrats!!!!  I'm so salty right now, I just spent 180gems (my wallet hurts) and the only valuable things that i got are 2 killers 4* and Capone 5*, the rest all silvers or characters that I already had..."
OnePieceTC,3dc7wh,chairmanedz,3,Wed Jul 15 03:34:14 2015 UTC,"ouch, in the 250 it took to get Rayleigh the only thing I got from the new batch was an Apoo."
OnePieceTC,3dc7wh,day2k,3,Wed Jul 15 03:37:52 2015 UTC,"to be fair, the character I was expecting the most, aside from Kidd, wb and rayleigh, was apoo, to put him alongside law and get the combo, but even that didnt happen :(.  I think I wont pull again in another sugo until the sw batch and hope I can get some juicy characters then."
OnePieceTC,3dc7wh,Zilas,3,Wed Jul 15 03:42:21 2015 UTC,and a Jewelry Bonney right?

OnePieceTC,3dc7wh,ravsx,3,Wed Jul 15 04:13:44 2015 UTC,"I got Cabin boy helmeppo , 3star final evolution :(   I just got arlong after doing the mission only 3 times ever so I guess that's kinda lucky  you might be able to get another gem before sugofest ends, for me it's impossible to get another spin done unless I go wallet :P"
OnePieceTC,3dc7wh,OddSensation,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:38:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah I probably will when I wake up, but I don't mind. Now I know to hoard gems for the next one!! I only started playing maybe a month and a half ago, and just found this sub a couple days ago, so I was stupidly using gems willy nilly (no impulse control when I've had a couple beers in me), especially when I was finishing up the last couple islands with an under leveled team.   Oops!"
OnePieceTC,3dc7wh,luctran89,2,Wed Jul 15 04:58:35 2015 UTC,"I started about 4weeks ago, I spend 15 gems on the PSY increased chance (sugofest wasn't announced when I spend them) and I got Mr 2 bon clay ... 3 times in a row, once was first evolution the other 2 were his last, that kinda sucked!  I honestly don't know if I can save up gems for next sugofest or not, I'd like to get a couple more good characters before I start saving up for next sugo.. not sure how much time there is between every sugofest but I'm guessing its a couple months.. which would make it do-able to save up gems for a couple pulls and maybe even grab a legendary (Kappa)"

OnePieceTC,3dfjhb,bozon92,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:39:42 2015 UTC,"Congrats... I got him too, but I don't know where I should use him except as a sub on a G3 team. There is no point to build a striker team since Dual Mihawk + Boat is better in every way shape and form."
OnePieceTC,3dfjhb,koryuken,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:50:56 2015 UTC,"True, it's just nice to have him lol. I'm not done pulling so maybe I'll get something else too"
OnePieceTC,3dfjhb,dowhatuwant2,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:04:25 2015 UTC,"Not every shape and form, they have shit recovery. Plus with a striker team you can bring urogue for increased damage."
OnePieceTC,3dfjhb,koryuken,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:06:06 2015 UTC,"True, but slashers have Doffy. Slashers get that metal guy from Alabaster that boosts slasher damage."
OnePieceTC,3dfjhb,dowhatuwant2,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:55:23 2015 UTC,Not yet they don't.
OnePieceTC,3dfjhb,Dontlisten2mee,0,Thu Jul 16 03:57:19 2015 UTC,"Well, I think at the moment, striker teams with a whitebeard may be about the same as slasher team (so you still get the amazing 30% hp off special) as with Urogue you get the atk boost for strikers with his special. Haven't really looked much into it, just initial thoughts."
OnePieceTC,3dfjhb,koryuken,2,Wed Jul 15 21:55:36 2015 UTC,"WB cooldown is 25 (no way to lower currently), he is super rare, and does 30% with just one special. Dual Mihawk is plentiful, does 50% instantly, has a 17 CD maxed, slashers get Doflamingo who boosts orbs/swaps them(best sub, if not the best character in the game arguably) AND get a boat to boost hp. Just stating the facts since I found myself wondering what teams to build outside of G3/Slashers."
OnePieceTC,3dfjhb,Dontlisten2mee,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:59:41 2015 UTC,"Ya, I definitely agree that slashers are arguably better, was just thinking that strikers may not be horrible either."
OnePieceTC,3dfjhb,dowhatuwant2,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:03:37 2015 UTC,Striker teams have Urogues special though....
OnePieceTC,3dfjhb,Matainer,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:07:31 2015 UTC,"Doffy isnt relevent as of right now, as he is still at least 2 months off. and that's iff Zephyr is tomorrow and the next Raid bosses are one month exact. Mr.1 also isnt out yet, so right now, Strikers are as a whole on par with slashers. that will not be so when maxed skill mihawks actually show up enough to matter, more people have mihawks ship, Doffy is out, and mr.1 comes out."
OnePieceTC,3dfjhb,fatguywithnolife,1 point,Thu Jul 16 08:43:36 2015 UTC,Nice pull.  I got him as well but only his 4* version though.
OnePieceTC,3dcctt,Adrales,15,Wed Jul 15 04:07:13 2015 UTC,"For the people too lazy to follow the link:  -there are now ""hidden abilities"" sort of analogous to Awakenings in PaD. These are achieved by fusing the same characters together (not the same version, which is nice), and gives you a chance at getting Lock Release, Special Cooldown Reduction, Heals every turn, and Damage Reduction for example. You need a certain value for one of these between all members of your crew to achieve this effect.  -New type to join the Slashers/Strikers/Fighters/Shooters. Certain characters may be changed or may gain a second type. The teaser suggest G3 Luffy, Law, and Ace will be changed in this way."
OnePieceTC,3dcctt,xAndrenx,5,Wed Jul 15 04:24:52 2015 UTC,I wonder how this would work for gatcha units that dont have counterparts in fortnight islands. Hopefully this system doesn't break the game. Boa with built in turn-heal would be wicked :)
OnePieceTC,3dcctt,day2k,2,Wed Jul 15 04:43:02 2015 UTC,"That's a good point I hadn't thought about! Maybe the 6* characters will get more ""common"" versions that can only give the less favorable abilities? Hard to imagine a fully evolved 5* Whitebeard or Rayleigh though."
OnePieceTC,3dcctt,xAndrenx,1 point,Wed Jul 15 05:12:42 2015 UTC,"Yep, covers it all!"
OnePieceTC,3dcctt,tadabola,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:27:40 2015 UTC,"thank you. the new type  seems weird, if was ace and law it could be something like ""power"" (logias for example), but G3 should be a fighter I think"
OnePieceTC,3dcctt,xAndrenx,2,Wed Jul 15 04:27:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah, no idea what to expect from a fifth type, but I guess it's the easier option than adding a new color and throwing color balance out the window.  Logias could be a cool type, but it might be an even more general divide of just something like ""Devil Fruit"" if similar games were used for precedent."
OnePieceTC,3dcctt,xAndrenx,4,Wed Jul 15 04:31:04 2015 UTC,What if its people with the Will of the D Luffy Law Ace :O
OnePieceTC,3dcctt,rubbertrain12,2,Wed Jul 15 04:33:54 2015 UTC,"Feel like that would just become a marker for insanely powerful units lol, look at them so far. It's like original Ace and Law are the least powerful as 2.5x leaders.  Could be Haki too? Especially with this stuff going closer to the timeskip."
OnePieceTC,3dcctt,xAndrenx,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:37:28 2015 UTC,Do you think it maybe a Haki thing? or the 'D' thing perhaps? But if any of these to be true the former would be the cooler one.
OnePieceTC,3dcctt,rubbertrain12,1 point,Wed Jul 15 05:06:33 2015 UTC,"My guess is ""Devil Fruit"" because we're still before the timeskip where it's less prevalent. Then once we get a few islands in (or past Marineford) ""Haki"" will be introduced as a somewhat uncommon secondary type."
OnePieceTC,3dcctt,day2k,1 point,Wed Jul 15 05:09:41 2015 UTC,I guess you are probably right. Devil Fruit makes more sense considering the timeline of the game. Cheers..
OnePieceTC,3dcctt,tadabola,1 point,Wed Jul 15 05:14:53 2015 UTC,"not really, the 3 units shown are g3, ace, and law, all of whom are fruit users :)  so ""power"" is a good guess. fruit users would probably be it, and there would probably be bosses who target fruit users (for example, Smoker's using kairoseki)"
OnePieceTC,3dcctt,day2k,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:31:17 2015 UTC,"I think could be more generic, like Nami who atacks with thuder/fireballs, could be power you now? she is not shooter (when she does that, she can be striker since she does use her rod)"
OnePieceTC,3dcctt,Oedipustrexeliot,2,Wed Jul 15 04:34:45 2015 UTC,"I c, but I think fruit users work better in the context of the game. It's a good addition that fits the OP lore, and leads to a lot of suitable game dynamics  If that's the case, a year later they might add a 6th type as haki users :)"
OnePieceTC,3dcctt,eventual12345,6,Wed Jul 15 04:41:30 2015 UTC,"Wow, some dick down voted every comment in the thread with two accounts.  Fuck that guy, I'm up voting everyone."
OnePieceTC,3dcctt,xAndrenx,1 point,Wed Jul 15 08:16:33 2015 UTC,"I don't play the Japanese version but I'm very interested in seeing how this turns out.  My worry is that the difficulty of new content will increase substantially based on these new skills and it'll be pretty hard to keep up with it all.  Just a feeling though, obviously not based on any concrete evidence."
OnePieceTC,3dcctt,eventual12345,1 point,Wed Jul 15 06:16:13 2015 UTC,"If it's like games with similar mechanics, there may be special units introduced whose sole purpose is to contribute to these skills.

However since white beard has been around for quite some time longer than Rayleigh, you will definitely see more white beards than Rayleigh.  Keep in mind rarity for sugo exclusives may not be a good thing. The less you see a character the more difficult it' is to find friend captains."

I'd say farm and get the purple lobsters you need, then sell any extras you have if we don't get the box increase. With Crocodile coming out soon, you'll definitely need purple lobsters and this will save you a ton of stamina trying to desperately farm them later on."

I only got 2 from the first event and I wound up getting Wapol and 8-10 lobsters, at least one of every color besides purple, from the last stage of Drum Island."
OnePieceTC,3deyha,FellatioRex,3,Wed Jul 15 19:20:07 2015 UTC,"I'd say go ahead and farm them unless you really need jozu/blamenco books.  I'm in a similar spot in that I only have 1 purple lobster, but only have 2 for every other color as well besides red.  My goal is to get 3-4 of each.  Overall it is quite a pain but its better to have them on hand than to hope for RNG and luck while farming when you can use your stamina for better things."

OnePieceTC,3de0tq,DJ_Hamster,3,Wed Jul 15 15:15:18 2015 UTC,I don't know if they are completely essential but I would say if you're strapped for gems farming Mihawk and leveling him to max is a higher priority. ESPECIALLY with this event happening during a special level up event. This is the perfect opportunity to level him up with a lower cost on gems. His special is going to help you on most raid bosses in the future. Maybe pull 2 or 3 times if you can but I'd save at least 20 gems for Mihawk if you can. 40 stam is what you want to be able to farm for the 100% drop. If you're 80 stam or more then you definitely need to be doing this. You can get 2 Mihawk's per gem.
OnePieceTC,3de0tq,nightgt,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:21:03 2015 UTC,"Hi,  you could look at the JPN threads which are about one year ahead and see what teams they use? Rayleigh is a great unit but chances are very low to get him.  I should know after losing 300+ gems.  Atleast I got Kidd who is another great unit in this batch. The next batch will introduce more good units plus these supernovas again so your choice."
OnePieceTC,3de0tq,Fuzzy_MI,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:20:37 2015 UTC,"Got a question... I'm a newbie.    There is a sugofest every month, and there will be new units introduced, plus all the ones that are already released?  So we can still get the supernova and WB and Rayleigh next time, if we are super duper lucky, right?"
OnePieceTC,3de0tq,kof201,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:00:39 2015 UTC,Yep. The characters will generally appear in future sugofests
OnePieceTC,3de0tq,Fuzzy_MI,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:08:46 2015 UTC,"Rayleigh Kidd and to a lesser extent Urogue are sorta important in future content.    Rayleigh is just straight up one of the best captains to have, but it's not like he is required to beat future content.  If you have WB or G3 and have Rayleigh it is pretty much preference on who you want to use.  Kidd and Urogue will be valuable to have when the Crocodile fortnight comes since impact units have no restrictions set on them.  Everyone else has their uses and are great but you don't need them.  Raid bosses like mihawk and doflamingo are extremely good to have and are much better than the supernovas imo"
OnePieceTC,3de0tq,FellatioRex,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:33:04 2015 UTC,"law/apoo/capone are good orb changers and probably the only ones able to be considered essential... if you dont have wb or g3 then rayleigh will take you pretty far, and kidd is somewhat of a replacement for g3.  nothing is really essential, slasher teams can clear just about everything if you put the work in to max splv on various units."

OnePieceTC,3de6wm,KamiLuka,2,Wed Jul 15 16:00:56 2015 UTC,"I used double killer for all the story chapters so far, can usually get through them effortlessly without much thought. He is also a good QCK sub because of his high attack. However, I can't remember the last time we had a STR fortnight, so hasn't been of much use lately. Not sure who the next STR fortnight is or when it is but he should be useful then, especially if you can only use QCK."
OnePieceTC,3de6wm,Altair1124,2,Wed Jul 15 16:21:00 2015 UTC,"next ones are (i think), rob lucci (dex only), kraken (blue only - WB books), franky (INT only) and hogback (psy only)"
OnePieceTC,3de6wm,tadabola,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:37:34 2015 UTC,"Yup, the Kraken is QCK only"
OnePieceTC,3de6wm,basedchristos,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:37:12 2015 UTC,"Ya I think I'll just end up using him as a sub, since his captain ability seems to only secure around 3 kills. Thanks for your help"
OnePieceTC,3de6wm,gianmk11,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:44:24 2015 UTC,"Pretty sure I read on reddit before that  a killer team does less dmg then a 2.5x boost captain. That's with a crew where everyone had like 1k dmg. Might be wrong, but he's still the highest dmg qck unit/slasher so he's still a pretty awesome sub."
OnePieceTC,3de6wm,Obson96,2,Wed Jul 15 16:24:03 2015 UTC,Yeah he is the strongest qck unit in the game but he's a striker not a slasher for some reason.
OnePieceTC,3de6wm,gianmk11,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:29:33 2015 UTC,"Hmmm, that's weird.... guess I thought he was a slasher since he used those sickle/ hand blady thing 😂"
OnePieceTC,3de6wm,gianmk11,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:39:12 2015 UTC,"Ya even though his captain ability seems great, I feel as if I'm not doing much damage with him, so I think I'll just use him as a sub when need be. Thanks for your help"
OnePieceTC,3de6wm,archevil,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:42:40 2015 UTC,Always happy to be able to help 😊
OnePieceTC,3de6wm,hkreeves,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:44:37 2015 UTC,"yeah killer team will deal less damage, but if you use coby / kaku to boost the orb damage, killer team will deal more damage"
OnePieceTC,3de6wm,tadabola,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:51:00 2015 UTC,"Not complete. Killer team lacks damage with normal orbs. But once matching orbs show up, especiall two or three of them, the boost is significant. And you don't need them on your heavy hitters. Even a supportive role like usopp can land stRong final hit with a matching orb. Coby special makes the case god like."
OnePieceTC,3de6wm,tadabola,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:10:45 2015 UTC,"he does kinda the same damage as 2.5 captains in general, but he shines against STR enemies,  since you will be using double him (the strongest blue unit) to deal the boosted atk.   I use him as a blue lead only. I think he is better than Ace"
OnePieceTC,3de6wm,koryuken,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:36:25 2015 UTC,Bummer I was hoping he was better than a 2.5x thanks for your help.
OnePieceTC,3de61z,blade21st,4,Wed Jul 15 15:54:26 2015 UTC,"400 gems and no 6* legend makes anyone sad.... I managed to stop myself after 2 zoro, 1 usopp and a kuro pull, guess my gems are for mihawk 😂"
OnePieceTC,3de61z,gianmk11,2,Wed Jul 15 16:02:08 2015 UTC,Same for me 570 spent no rey got all super novas tho
OnePieceTC,3de61z,majincloud1985,2,Wed Jul 15 16:35:29 2015 UTC,"Same boat as you :) I now have Kidd, Killer, Urogue, and Hawkins -- so I do have a top tier Stiker team. However, I don't know what the point of it is since its still inferior to Doulbe Mihawk + Boat."
OnePieceTC,3de61z,koryuken,2,Wed Jul 15 17:41:48 2015 UTC,"Yea I am really sad to see all these Mihawks everywhere. Makes the point of other teams feel very inferior/diminished if Mihawk is that easy to obtain, that common, and also pretty much the best especially with the new boat. Where's the fun and variety of even bothering to make any other teams when you can just make a simple/basic striker team, now tomorrow with double skill up Mihawk teams will get another boost since a lot of people will probably easily max him now."
OnePieceTC,3de61z,psykomerc,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:23:36 2015 UTC,"I don't mind having Mihawks all over, but I do see it as a balance issue. The 50% instant damage from 2 Mihawks is just too good. The additional HP from the boat is just cherry on top. This is a balance issue. Currently, there is almost no incentive to build other teams for raid bosses. Unless strikers/fighters/etc get a %hp reduction special and their own boats, slashers are going to be best forever. This is especially true as raid bosses get stronger and stronger -- since the instant 50% damage will increase in value even further. Strikers may have amazing burst with the highest stats in the game, but it is still worse than instant 50% damage."

OnePieceTC,3df0tx,montblancnoland,0,Wed Jul 15 19:34:15 2015 UTC,"yea hold off, with only 10 gems you will only be disappoint. try to make it so you have atleast 5+ pulls during a sugo."

OnePieceTC,3de4ja,raistlyn,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:01:10 2015 UTC,"Wow, maxing him  is out the question then. Should be able to evolve him at least though so I guess it's not too bad (expecting around 50-60 copies)"

OnePieceTC,3dc62a,ShunTune,13,Wed Jul 15 03:08:49 2015 UTC,"Worst Sugo ever.  I did 5 pulls and got V2 Sanji, V1 Sanji, V1 Zoro, Kuro and Chuu... all useless or copies. I'm super salty about this cause my pulls have been shit from the moment I started this game and the best pull I've ever gotten was a unevolved Vista and that wasn't even during Sugo.  Even worse is the fact that gems are ridiculously expensive even for just 5."
OnePieceTC,3dc62a,Freyzi,2,Wed Jul 15 03:18:20 2015 UTC,"My friend did 10 pulls, got several Kurobis, Sanjis and his best pull was Brain Point Chopper. There's always a worse Sugo."

I have a grand total of 4 pullable only characters, one of them, V2 Sanji I've pulled 3 times now and Impact Usopp twice. Wanna know the first 3 pulls I ever did when I first started? Kuroobi, Chuu and Base Zoro.   I actually caved in a few minutes ago and wasted 6 bucks on 6 gems and got Dancing Django who I at least don't have already even though he's probably not very good.  Well time to save up again. One a day, my 100th day playing is coming up so that's another 10, next Island will give me a sizable amount and so on and so on. Next Sugo better be better."

OnePieceTC,3ddzm4,Devansmash,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:06:33 2015 UTC,"Yes (evolved) and yes.  They both offer 2.5x attack to their colors, so they're among the best type-based leads.  They both also have pretty good specials."
OnePieceTC,3ddzbv,changchongching,5,Wed Jul 15 15:04:25 2015 UTC,Rayleigh because of how nice and easy he is to use. WB is a better choice if you want to spend more time planning than actually playing but have the guarantee that you can do all the content in the game.
OnePieceTC,3ddzbv,patrykgam,2,Wed Jul 15 15:09:42 2015 UTC,Choose Ray account.  Both are good but Ray is easier at start and is strong later on.   If you don't want the Ray account then could I have it?
OnePieceTC,3ddzbv,Fuzzy_MI,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:13:13 2015 UTC,"I never tried rayleigh myself, so I don't really know, But I do have a G3, which is pretty similar, and I can say for sure that I prefer whitebeard... missing a perfect really destroys a G3 team, While whitebeard is Just some preparation and you are good to go, But I'm pretty lazy when it comes to hitting perfect so I think it's more upto what you prefer."
OnePieceTC,3ddzbv,gianmk11,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:12:09 2015 UTC,I'm not a newb in this game my other account is p135 uses mainly g3 and mihawk. Difference with g3 vs Rayleigh is Rayleigh although slightly less damage he can eat meat at any point he can just get a great in the middle of his combo without completely ruining everything unlike g3 if you get great on your third hit you're completely screwed. Finally Rayleigh isn't completely dead if some of the units are locked   So its not nearly the same.
OnePieceTC,3ddzbv,gianmk11,3,Wed Jul 15 16:18:55 2015 UTC,Guess that's your answer then 😂 Just a reminder that a double whitebeard with max special ( kraken island later) along with a max special mihawk sub are pretty devastating for any upcoming raidboss :-P
OnePieceTC,3ddzbv,Kinnikufan,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:35:53 2015 UTC,I know this is one of the reason it's not a simple choice for me.I think there isn't an island wb can't finish and Rayleigh can ....
OnePieceTC,3ddzbv,S3xybaus,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:44:55 2015 UTC,"I think I've made my decision to go with Rayleigh, although wb does do significantly more damage and his special is way better as well. His 30% health prerequisite means with most boss I can't mess up and really need to know I can burst them down. If I accidentally ate a meat that makes me over 30% I basically lose.  Although there is a nice ship for him that will greatly make this easier. I do think overall Rayleigh with no weak orbs is just more versatile and a bit more stress free in comparison. I can even opt to use healers in my team. In the end allowing myself to take an extra hit or two might end up doing similar damage overall compared to wb. I do know there will be times that the burst is needed.  I think overall Rayleigh without the 30% health seems to be mless stressful while maintaining high DMG"

OnePieceTC,3ddzbv,lucif3l,3,Wed Jul 15 15:10:43 2015 UTC,People are forgetting that we get kraken isle soon too. X2 wb with low cd on special and mihawk means any raid boss and content are a joke. So if op is trying to grind that wb special id stay with wb over ray. If not use ray.

OnePieceTC,3ddvkd,SwingingSalmon,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:49:26 2015 UTC,Unfortunately Izo is useless since Izo+Khalifa is a much weaker combo than Apoo+Law.

The only critical issue is to stall enough for your Ussop's CD."
OnePieceTC,3dd3v7,drunkenrabbit_,1 point,Wed Jul 15 09:58:54 2015 UTC,If you want a video on this:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbMyvjIUhCI (Spaceman)
OnePieceTC,3dd3v7,TheRealBlydd,1 point,Wed Jul 15 11:34:56 2015 UTC,Thanks for the video! It's possible with this team and my usopp cooldown is 11. May have a good time to speed threw mohawk :)
OnePieceTC,3dd3v7,rafilfc,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:09:54 2015 UTC,Looking at the spaceman vid below you can stall for at least 15 turns whilst taking one extra hit from the penguin. So you should be perfectly fine. I will be  using the same team excepting subbing jozu for mihawk.
OnePieceTC,3dd3v7,pinopi,1 point,Wed Jul 15 12:30:57 2015 UTC,"He had 18 turns to stall in the video. Although unlikely to happen, worst case mob CDs would give you 4 fewer turns (14 turns). Those with 15 CD Usopps can use Jozu to get that 1 extra turn or take a second hit from the penguin (need more than 7906 HP total)."
OnePieceTC,3dd3v7,rafilfc,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:49:33 2015 UTC,Either way his fine
OnePieceTC,3dd3v7,aHomelessBum,-6,Wed Jul 15 19:29:27 2015 UTC,"Impossible. With 2 Monster Chopper as captain, you'll only have around under 3k hp. Mihawk will do a 4k pre-emptive attack."
OnePieceTC,3dd3v7,hkreeves,3,Wed Jul 15 09:41:31 2015 UTC,What r u talking about. His team only has 3 red. Jozu+Vista+usopp provide 6k already.
OnePieceTC,3dd3v7,hunterdaniel1,1 point,Wed Jul 15 10:13:34 2015 UTC,"How does ny team look? http://imgur.com/Sgvcyph When i put it in the dmg calc i have 6800 hp and 272,000 dmg"
OnePieceTC,3dd3v7,hkreeves,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:17:55 2015 UTC,"Not really doable, since you cant heal back with meat and you need to tank 6200 preemptive DMG in total. That means you cant stall at all. A simple replacement of your friend captain from MC to G3 may solve the problem depending on your usopp cd."
OnePieceTC,3dd3v7,hunterdaniel1,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:35:29 2015 UTC,What if replaced zoro with lvl 96 smoker and use his special. 2k dmg from mihawk and I use gp ussop. I estimated i can stall 15 turns unless i throw in a tsuru instead.
OnePieceTC,3dd3v7,hkreeves,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:51:50 2015 UTC,Sounds like a plan. Saving 2k should give you 2 or 3 turn on penguin. Tsuru may work as well if the math tells you so.
OnePieceTC,3dd3v7,IliaAndru97,-4,Wed Jul 15 19:20:43 2015 UTC,"You have to use a gem at this point, but on the next 4-5 turns, you can burst him down."

OnePieceTC,3dd9u4,Fuzzy_MI,2,Wed Jul 15 11:33:26 2015 UTC,"Kidd and Rayleigh. The best account ever. If I may ask, how many re-rolls did it take you roughly??"
OnePieceTC,3dd9u4,Uchiha92,1 point,Wed Jul 15 12:19:29 2015 UTC,It took about 20 rerolls (I know insane!!) but I'd lost heart after pulling 6 times on my G3 account and only getting silvers.  Is there any way I could manage mihawk tomorrow or should I just wait for him to reappear?
OnePieceTC,3dd9u4,Uchiha92,1 point,Wed Jul 15 12:38:33 2015 UTC,"Wow!!! Congrats to you man, I'm actually rerolling as we speak. Even though I have a pl 105, nothing is comparable to Rayleighs versatility.   Well It all depends on your Sub units dude. Like alvida or jozu may be needed but then again if you can get a laboon, just befriend a vivi user and you should be sorted. Then again your pirate level has to be at least 30."
OnePieceTC,3dd9u4,PaperPandasaur,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:51:42 2015 UTC,Use the new one probably.  You could save this one and give it to someone or trade it?
OnePieceTC,3dd8av,faru94,3,Wed Jul 15 10:31:37 2015 UTC,Issue yourself a password and reroll until you get Whitebeard or Rayleigh and if you don't get either you can just continue on that account.

OnePieceTC,3deo46,MonicaOPTC,4,Wed Jul 15 18:02:35 2015 UTC,"Cry more. Bandai thinks your tears taste delicious.  On a less sarcastic note, I'd say that 5* X-Drake from 11 pulls is pretty damn good. X-Drake himself is a great INT captain/sub. If you were expecting loads of fantastic pulls from 56 gems, you were deluding yourself.  Sugofest is a rate up for good units, not guaranteed. Some people spend a hundred gems and get not a single supernova. It's gambling, RNG.  But hey, if you're gonna quit after one bad sugofest then maybe this game isn't for you."

I did a yolo pull yesterday with what stayed from farming Mihawk and got Killer. Which was totally unexpected. So it's not so bad. I love this goame and I hope they keep bringing the new content, without slowing down."
OnePieceTC,3deo46,condoriano225,1 point,Fri Jul 17 11:32:46 2015 UTC,"yeah, i love one piece so invariably thats whats going to keep me playing this game. Nice killer pull. People say pulling during type rate ups isnt the best. I tried it once, pulled 7 times during psy rate up, only psy pull was on my 7th. I was lucky though since it was marco, what i needed and got vista on my 5th pull also what i needed (rest were dead pulls), but I'd advice against pulling for a specific character. Plus, ivankov seems to be doable even if you dont have dex gacha units and doesnt look like dex gacha team can pull of an enel 60 stamina win either. So unless you got gems to burn, i'd save for stamina refills on raid bosses and fortnights that have skillbooks you need. goodluck, up to you in the end"

Take Arlong and alvida too, they're sooo useful :) Do you want to max Mihawk? then, you need something like 100 mihawks (without double special up event) so you need 50 mihawks , more or less. It really depends, you should do 5-6 pulls, and the other gems only for mihawk. That's because you already have some good slashers, and with the new boat, slashers becomes super-powerful ;)"

OnePieceTC,3dd2im,kys916,1 point,Wed Jul 15 09:52:05 2015 UTC,"Sorry for the late response. I probably only want to do 1 run of 40stam because I've never been able to clear raid bosses before so I want to get 1 Mihawk before I even think about maxing his special. Honestly I don't even think I have the team power or gems to efficiently farm Mihawk's special. So by your estimation, how many gems max would I need to beat 1 run of Mihawk 40stam, and I think I will dump the rest into today's Sugofest. Thanks though, I know people hate when others ask these kinds of questions but I've always been a terrible planner..."
OnePieceTC,3dd2im,kys916,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:27:02 2015 UTC,Manage ur hp. Use a blue turtle or penguin and stall on the green penguin pirate and stall for alvida and usopp specials.

OnePieceTC,3davv1,Ironman2131,2,Tue Jul 14 21:14:21 2015 UTC,One other comment about the difference between 30 and 40 stamina.  40 stamina is easier to stall on because of the green pirate penguin (in either stage 2 or 3).  So just because you blow through 40 stamina doesn't mean you can mindlessly tackle 30 stamina.
OnePieceTC,3davv1,Lucifer51,2,Tue Jul 14 22:42:35 2015 UTC,"I have two teams, a  strength team, G2 Luffy lv35, Arlong lv 42, Gp Usopp lv 33, Smoker lv 30 and or Arm Point Chopper lv 32, or a slasher team Arlong lv 42, Ashura Zoro lv 27, mr. 3 lv 30 gp Usopp lv 33 and a Tashigi lv 27, what can I do to ensure a Mihawk clear? And I have 18 gems either to spend on Slugofest or on the Mihawk event."
OnePieceTC,3davv1,MinTef,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:22:43 2015 UTC,"To be honest, I don't think you can 40 stamina Mihawk with those teams without gemming.  But you should be able to take out 30 stamina Mihawk.  As long as you make sure you get at least one Mihawk you'll be fine.  He'll be back at some point when you're more ready."
OnePieceTC,3davv1,Lucifer51,0,Wed Jul 15 01:27:43 2015 UTC,"Is your merry 1.2x or 1.5x? If you have a gear 3 friend as captain, you do about 212,000 Damage and your HP is around 7500 depending on what level the gear 3 friend is (I put it at 50). Mihawk has 590,000HP at 30 stamina and 1,180,000 at 40. If you can stall 15 turns (for Ussop) which you may struggle I believe you can do the 30 stamina without gemming. Use smoker before you kill the 4th stage should help you tank a little from him. 40 stamina is a no go. I can’t guarantee you will do it as it will require some luck with stalls. If you are only looking for 1 mihawk for your box then its well worth spending 5 gems on in my opinion anyway."

OnePieceTC,3dd8m4,Drayorb,2,Wed Jul 15 10:35:39 2015 UTC,Some do others do not. It depends on the skill name (not effect). If the skill name stays the same the skill lvl carries over.
OnePieceTC,3dd8m4,suppo,2,Wed Jul 15 10:47:03 2015 UTC,"Characters that keep the same special through their evolution keep their special level. So yes, Mihawk keeps his special lvl."
OnePieceTC,3dd8m4,Jalidric,1 point,Wed Jul 15 10:47:56 2015 UTC,Thanks :) is it also possible that I can level up the Special of Mihawk when he is Max LvL 5*?
OnePieceTC,3dd8m4,Jalidric,1 point,Fri Jul 17 10:41:46 2015 UTC,"Yep, you will still be able to fuse Mihawks to your 5* Mihawk to get Special Levels but you just won't get anymore exp for it (since its already max level)"

OnePieceTC,3daq4m,nightgt,3,Tue Jul 14 20:35:03 2015 UTC,"I beat it using Double WB, GP Usopp, Alvida, Helmeppo v2 and Asura Zoro. All units were 50+. I wanted to use Mihawk but couldn't afford the team cost, so I put Zoro in so i'd have a Dex unit. He wound up working really well. His AoE special was useful for Buggy and the crab stage. I had to stall a little more though to make sure it was up in time. Basically it all went as follows:   Buggy - Use Zoro special, should kill most of the minions. My Zoro is lvl 50, and he's kill all but two, and they had barely any health left, so it was easy to mop them and Buggy up in one round. Kuro - Focus Kuro down, last hitting with Zoro. Can usually take one hit from Django and be ok. Django dies quickly. Krieg - Nothing special here, same as OP. Arlong - I used Alvida and a WB here. Managed to kill Arlong first turn, but the Alvida still helps with the hit from Hatchan, and the saved health will be useful next round. Baroque Works - GP special, then take out Ms. Goldenweek, Mr. 3 and Mr. 5 as in OP. Now, at this point I would try to heal up enough to take one hit from Ms. Valentine and get dropped back to below 30% She hits for 2915, so factor accordingly. Letting her hit you once lets you stall 3 more turns here. This helped ensure my Zoro was back up for Crabs. Smoker - Unlock with Helmeppo, kill Tashigi first, wait till last turn to kill Smoker. Crabs - Zoro special kills all the crabs and gives you 3 turns to kill Rainbow Dragon. Strawhats - GP and one WB special here. Pretty much the same as OP, stall on Luffy till last turn. Mihawk - First WB was available again, so used it and Alvida here. I got lucky with orbs though and managed to kill him in one round. Not sure if Alvida special would have been enough to save me at that point. Remember, he hits harder when he's below 20% health."

I tried using double WB, Alvida, Mr.3, Usopp and Helmeppo v2 (for the pre-emptives that lock the units), but failed at Arlong once and Smoker/Tashigi another time.  In the end I managed to finish it using double G3, Alvida, Mr3, God Usopp and Mihawk... and I had only one turn left before Mihawk would shred me to pieces :)."
OnePieceTC,3daq4m,eldaras,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:54:57 2015 UTC,"Yea, there's a lot about how WB is the best captain to use (which is very true in most cases) but he's really difficult to use. I'm going to try and get more videos to illustrate some good ways to play WB teams. You've gotta develop a feel for how to stall, gather food when needed and of course timing. I've died a lot of times with WB and it's definitely frustrating -_- Once you get the health situation squared away it's much easier than a G3 team though. Getting to that point is what makes G3 the easier option in most cases though, haha :p"
OnePieceTC,3daq4m,kys916,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:15:29 2015 UTC,"I fully agree. I think the reason I failed was because I didn't use Usopp, Alvida and Mr3 properly to avoid getting hit at some points... so as you said, learning how to stall is very important for WB teams.  I'm looking forward to watch your videos!"

The higher DPS and Special is what makes WB a 6* character ;-) But his DPS is not the highest. 4* Arlong has more damage than Whitebeard as do a few others."
OnePieceTC,3daq4m,hlxino,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:50:33 2015 UTC,"I'm saying as a captain. Whitebeard has the Highest DPS captain effect in the game, bar none, however the only reason its viable is because of how much health double WB special takes off. without it, hes like monster chopper, a squishy as hell burst captain."
OnePieceTC,3daq4m,comomellamo,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:48:02 2015 UTC,A option for those that have Mr. 3 (me) was to use Sanji or Vista as a sub. Use it on Buggy and Crab stage. I actually used Alvida on Arlong stage and GP against Boroque. Then tank one on Smoker stage from Tashigi and blast through Crabs. GP on Mugiwara with one Mihawk or WB special. And then just burst Mihawk himself.

OnePieceTC,3dabk4,itspabo,2,Tue Jul 14 18:56:33 2015 UTC,What about having low stam. I'd only get in 1 run per refill with 64 stam. Feels awkward to waste 24 stam everytime :O
OnePieceTC,3dabk4,Pudschu,4,Tue Jul 14 19:04:34 2015 UTC,"you wouldn't be wasting it, you can always spend that 24 stam on fortnights and since raidbosses gives a butt-ton of exp there will be times where after finishing mihawk you can level off a 15stam fortnight and then get free refills off that."
OnePieceTC,3dabk4,Ironman2131,2,Tue Jul 14 20:07:43 2015 UTC,"If you're farming Mihawk, you'll likely gain enough levels to have 70 stamina pretty soon.  Then you can just do one of each every time your refill."

OnePieceTC,3dabk4,yorunomegami,0,Tue Jul 14 19:07:51 2015 UTC,"Generally i would agree, but mihawk and double skill up is basically ka-ching, winning lottery etc. If you have a consistant way of farming mihawk 40stam just do it. use the rest of your stamina exp efficiently and get as many plvl as possible while farming the greatest swordsman. it's definitely worth it - slasher team is the go to team, especially for f2p players."
OnePieceTC,3dabk4,Mugiwaras,2,Tue Jul 14 20:57:36 2015 UTC,"So i need some help. here is my team. I have 46 gems. I'm not interested in farming Mihawk as it is just not worth it as i doubt it will be possible to reliably beat him with my team. So my question is, will i be able to beat the 40 stamina one with my team once if i save some devil fruits to use for continues? If so, how many should i save so i know how many i can spend on Sugo Fest?"
OnePieceTC,3dabk4,Lammington,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:51:23 2015 UTC,"I'd say I'm exactly where you are as to the powerlevel of my box so I'd like to read the help you get. I'm at 55 gems.

OnePieceTC,3dabk4,Zenima,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:50:28 2015 UTC,"Should be somewhat fine actually, though you will want to save some gems. G3 is about the right level, and your Arlong is evolved, if underlevelled. Put as much exp into Arlong as you can afford to over these next few days, and you should have a decent shot at no-gemming Mihawk. Double G3 (see if you can get a high-levelled G3 friend, that will help immensely), Arlong, Alvida, Onigumo, and GP Usopp. Stall for the latter three's specials on green pirate penguin, don't let your units get locked or hp go below 5k pre-Mihawk, hit your perfects, and you should be good. I'd say save any excess gems (like if you have 43 gems save those 3) and you should be good on getting Mihawk. Save more gems if you want to farm him a bit."
OnePieceTC,3dabk4,Lammington,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:02:04 2015 UTC,"Just curious, but do you think the Onigumo special outvalues the orb switching/extra force unit I'd get from Blamenco?"
OnePieceTC,3dabk4,Zenima,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:04:49 2015 UTC,"If running G3, an extra force unit isn't that useful unless he's stronger than one of the G3's or Arlong, which is unlikely. The orb switching could come in handy though, which would be the reason you'd swap him out. I'd say it's up to you."
OnePieceTC,3dabk4,Zenima,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:21:29 2015 UTC,"You're pretty close, have all the characters needed, just not high enough levels. So I would agree, don't worry about farming him this round.   I don't recall the exact stats, but you will want G3 as captain, with your highest non-Luffy STR attacker, Alvida, Onigumo, and Gp Usopp. If Alvida has higher attack than Mr 5 and Arlong, you can throw in another utility character of your choice. (Red marine, Mr. 3, Tsuru, etc.)  If you hit your perfects, should not need more than 5-10 gems, and that's an overestimate probably, especially if you have a highlevel G3 friend. Make sure to stall on the green pirate penguin to get Onigumo's, Alvida's, and GP's special up. Use Alvida to kill the sea horse, and just miss all your attacks on that stage (4/5). Make sure you have over 5k health before moving on from the pirate penguin."

OnePieceTC,3dabk4,_Madara_,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:49:42 2015 UTC,"No, because the preemptive counts as an own turn. U could use smoker's special tho. EDIT: smoker's special does not work on mihawk's preemptive strike."
OnePieceTC,3dabk4,saiyanslayer190,3,Tue Jul 14 20:26:31 2015 UTC,"No you can't, smoker doesn't work on specials.  There are 2 types of preemptives: specials and normal attacks. Smoker does NOT work on specials (like Mihawk's), just normal attacks.  Smoker's fortnight is what confused people. He uses his special, which locks your captain, then he does a normal attack which is why the damage reduction works. The same isn't true for Helmeppo from the cobimeppo fortnight, he deals damage with his special so it remains unaffected by damage reductions.  Smoker vs Helmeppo screenshots (thanks /u/Braindizzle) http://imgur.com/a/8HiPd  Unless my memory is failing me, Mihawk's pre-emptive is his special so Smoker won't help."
OnePieceTC,3dabk4,saiyanslayer190,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:47:53 2015 UTC,Mihawk's Preemptive is an attack with his dagger not with his Yoru. So no special.  if mihawk's dagger attack is a special than u may be correct other than that not.
OnePieceTC,3dabk4,MrKoontar,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:29:50 2015 UTC,"I looked it up by myself again and it seems that you are right. When u get damage from a preemptive without being actually attacked by the character,  then the damage can't be reduced,(like mihawk and helmeppo).  If the character actually attacks you in the preemptive then the damage can be reduced."

OnePieceTC,3dabk4,adyniz,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:06:00 2015 UTC,"There's other factors too... like how much time you got to farm him, or whether you have a good stable of fillers/captains. Maxing MiHawk is great, but sometimes it's helpful to roll during sugo for top tier captains and fillers alike. MiHawk comes back many times, as does sugofest, so no biggie if you go just one route.

OnePieceTC,3dabk4,BankaiKenpachi,5,Wed Jul 15 11:10:14 2015 UTC,I would say yes
OnePieceTC,3dabk4,MSC_Jake,4,Tue Jul 14 19:18:39 2015 UTC,"That's what I plan to do. Some people say that you shouldn't gem for refills or farm raidbosses until you have 80 stam and can get two guaranteed drops per refill, but having Mihawk coincide with a 2x skill up is too much of an opportunity to pass up. The higher skill level of your Mihawk, the easier and easier any future fortnights or raidbosses will be."
OnePieceTC,3dabk4,pauiyck,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:22:34 2015 UTC,"When Mihawk arrived for the first time, my stam was about 70. What I did was that I farmed 40 stam, waited about an hour and 40 min and ran 40 again. Then used the gem, and repeated same thing. Down side was, I had to call for multiple restroom breaks during the work, lol. I farmed about 30 something Mihawks that way, gained multiple pirate level ups and tons of beli."
OnePieceTC,3dabk4,pinballwiz,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:24:47 2015 UTC,"you should still farm him, as for the 30 stam, as long as you use it on something including khalifa 30 for some exp you'll probably end up leveling often too so you can always account for that for some free refills too. It's very situational"
OnePieceTC,3dabk4,MSC_Jake,0,Tue Jul 14 19:28:38 2015 UTC,So can a vivi/zoro run 40 stam?
OnePieceTC,3dabk4,Souuul,0,Tue Jul 14 20:06:05 2015 UTC,"No, cause at 20% mihawk deals 25k dmg that reduced from zoro is 5k wich vivi cant heal, but u can do 30 stamina (actually u can do 40 st if u are able to burst him down from 20%hp in 4 turns from gp special)"
OnePieceTC,3dabk4,MSC_Jake,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:08:15 2015 UTC,"for anyone thinking of doing the 40 stamina with vivi/zoro, I would take a look at this guide.  It would seem the best way to burst him before you die (granted you have Alvida from her island)."

OnePieceTC,3dabk4,suganips,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:45:24 2015 UTC,Yup that'll do the trick. Good luck grinding that 30/40 stam Mihawk haha
OnePieceTC,3dabk4,lookingforlaboons,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:32:50 2015 UTC,Crunching numbers generated from the damage calculator. It should take me roughly 15-19 minutes.   That's okay.
OnePieceTC,3dabk4,lookingforlaboons,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:37:25 2015 UTC,"you should also try the dmg calculator with a mihawk sub, because you'll have one after the first run. I'm pretty sure you can change a member for him"
OnePieceTC,3dabk4,vanminhu,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:02:28 2015 UTC,yes
OnePieceTC,3dabk4,DatAtroDoe,0,Tue Jul 14 20:59:15 2015 UTC,"What exactly are you ""adding""?  From the OP:   Save for refills and take advantage that 2x skill up is overlapped with mihawk"
OnePieceTC,3dabk4,vanminhu,0,Tue Jul 14 21:44:00 2015 UTC,"Except the OP and several other people have already mentioned that, so again, you're not ""adding"" anything."
OnePieceTC,3dabk4,yorunomegami,-1,Tue Jul 14 22:24:36 2015 UTC,Ehmm but maxing Mihawk is also not 100% safe since you can fail 5 characters in one time if he won't skill level up. Im currently 75 stam so i can do one 40 stam and one 30 stam. Or should i wait till 80 stam ( will take 30 mins ) and then refill ? Also how many mihawks you use in one power up ( most will do 5 right ?) If it's true then it's still risky cuz if it fails i lose 2 gems on 4 mihawks wasted. Of course i gain P level and also my mihawk is still Lv 45 which will gain exp. But yeah his special is the most important thing about him.
OnePieceTC,3dabk4,vanminhu,2,Tue Jul 14 22:29:07 2015 UTC,"You think that rolling for subs in Sugo is safer than farming Mihawk for skill-ups during a 2x skill-up event? Mihawk is the gateway to high-tier content in Treasure Cruise. A max skill level, or near to max, Mihawk sets you up for a lot of future fortnights and raidbosses. The Law and Apoo you desperately want so you can farm Lucci and Ivankov and Enel? The Kidd you need to make an impact team for Doffy? A G3 for the fortnights? A max skill Mihawk with a Mihawk friend and a decent slasher team can wipe the floor with almost anything, no overly specialised teams needed."
OnePieceTC,3dabk4,koryuken,-2,Tue Jul 14 22:44:34 2015 UTC,"Well i got Law already and yeah i was planning on getting Apoo/Kidd and if i can get WB or Rayleigh it would be awesome. But yeah i got a decent team for farming Mihawk just saying if it's like a sure to go, to max him from 32 to 17 with like 30-40 gems while my stamina is 75"
OnePieceTC,3dabk4,Uikutoru,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:06:25 2015 UTC,"you'll get plvl ups while farming mihawk. just do it, one 40stam, one 30stam. maxing mihawk is the most important thing a f2p can do."
OnePieceTC,3dabk4,Ironman2131,2,Tue Jul 14 19:26:08 2015 UTC,"it's 100% safe in the sense that you're risk vs reward is almost linear considering it's stacks with 2x skillup. If you think about it like this, if you were to fail 50 skill ups, it would be the equivalent of pulling 10 junk units from sugo (except mihawk still gets same character bonus).  As to when to refill that's personal preference, make sure to account for raid boss exp too because most people will level multiple times if they are farming it consistantly, if you work efficiently you might even reach the 80 stam break point before the end of the event."
OnePieceTC,3dabk4,Uikutoru,-1,Tue Jul 14 19:48:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah true man, about my 75 stamina problem. Just incase if i plan to farm Mihawk should i wait for the 5 stam to 40 (takes 50 mins) or should i do the 15 stam one and then refill my stam ?"
OnePieceTC,3dabk4,Ironman2131,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:00:19 2015 UTC,"if you're planning to farm it for the entire 24 hours there will be moments where you'd rather wait the 50min and make a snack so i wouldn't worry too much about it. It's too situational based on your current exp, after run exp, available fortnight exp and another bunch of scenarios to make a set plan. Just make sure to do the math before you do mihawk so you don't accidentally level with a full stam bar when you could've used 30 stam on khalifa first."
OnePieceTC,3dabk4,Magic-Man2,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:02:13 2015 UTC,"If I were you I would do 40 STA then 30 STA until you reach 80 STA. That is what I did the last time he was there, and I got enough Mihawks to almost max his special."
OnePieceTC,3dabk4,AnthonyH318,-1,Tue Jul 14 20:04:25 2015 UTC,can i beat the real 40 stam mihawk island with this? http://pasteboard.co/1Xv9vbWt.png

OnePieceTC,3dag85,Altair1124,2,Tue Jul 14 23:40:01 2015 UTC,Putting your team through the damage calculator. Assuming friend g3 is lvl 50 min. Max hp is 8800 and you should be hitting 390k but thats provided you hit your perfects. Its quite similar to the damage my team gets. So mihawk should be fine. I decided against g3 as im poor at hitting perfects under pressure.
OnePieceTC,3dag85,Card_Breaker,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:58:02 2015 UTC,I've been practising on the training island and I'm hitting them so think I'll be fine. The thing I'm really worried about is the stage before. Will have to wait and see I suppose. Thanks by the way.
OnePieceTC,3dag85,Card_Breaker,2,Wed Jul 15 00:03:11 2015 UTC,Im sure you can stall and use vista special
OnePieceTC,3dag85,FellatioRex,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:05:56 2015 UTC,Doing the math i believe i can only stall for 13 before that stage with 9k HP and his special is 15. I can remmeber the mobs being really weak though and thats when i did it with laboon.
OnePieceTC,3dag85,Altair1124,0,Wed Jul 15 00:34:39 2015 UTC,You still crying pal?

OnePieceTC,3dag85,faytthegreat,3,Fri Jul 17 01:06:24 2015 UTC,"A little higher than this due to the marine's pre-emptive. This HP requirement is ridiculous though and won't be achieved. However, if you bring Smoker and use his special the turn before going into Mihawk, you only need a little higher than 12500 HP+enough to cover the marine's hit since the pre-emptive from Mihawk will be reduced by half."

I think you dont even have to have his special maxed. 3-4 lvl ups might as well be enough.
OnePieceTC,3d9r5o,soshos,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:55:15 2015 UTC,"Hmmm.  I might do this for some quick runs, since double Chopper should be able to blow through Mihawk."

OnePieceTC,3d9r5o,Souuul,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:08:49 2015 UTC,And it worked for you on 40 stamina? I'm planning to run a straight STR team and I can clear 30 stam but I also have a Mr. Prince and so you made me consider it.
OnePieceTC,3d9r5o,bitereality,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:53:36 2015 UTC,"Yes.  I actually found 40 stamina a bit easier, since stalling is much easier on 40 stamina (the turtles have more health and I believe a green pirate penguin shows up that you can stall on).  A team of Mr. Prince (G3 friend), Alvida, GP Usopp, Morgan, and Arlong, all at level 50, can do 285,000 damage per turn with all neutral orbs.  Alvida and GP Usopp give you five turns to hit Mihawk before taking a full attack, so that's more than enough damage.  And just one matching orb on a Force character takes the damage above 350,000."

OnePieceTC,3d9r5o,Pudschu,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:46:52 2015 UTC,"Probably, but it's cutting it close and you'll need a meat orb along the way so you can tank a hit from Mihawk.  Your plan will be to use Alvida's special against Mihawk's first attack and then use GP Usopp on your second turn.  That will give you five turns to take out Mihawk, which should be enough unless your orbs suck."

OnePieceTC,3dbop9,bitereality,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:29:23 2015 UTC,"its a good idea, if you dont have the raid bosses, fortnights and any levels on their special. 104 isnt too hard to get too as p2p, and if you have most of the 24 hours free on mihawks return you can get a decent level on his special with zorro zombie. But then theres your merry ship, not sure how hard a time you had maxing it and if you have a g3 already... but that ray special is really useful  if you spent 200 gems on a ray reroll account and on your old account, your old account will be better, but after some months with raid and fortnight returns, your ray account should surpass your old account.  Up to you in the end"
OnePieceTC,3dbop9,bitereality,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:12:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah it only took me 60 days to get there and in all honesty, raid bosses such as MC and garp will surely be back.  Also my merry is 2 away from max so I don't really have much to lose apart from the gems And time spent. But like you said sooner or later the new account would surpass the old.

He is trained in world government warfare and is the top gacha puller in the entire blue sea. You are nothing to Coby but just another target. He will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on either side of The Grand Line, mark my fucking words."

OnePieceTC,3da42g,Kinnikufan,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:24:19 2015 UTC,"My suggestion?  Stop rolling as soon as you get a unit you're satisfied with or you have pulled 5 times.  But since you are adament about getting Mihawk maxed with only 60 gems, even with the skill-up event, you should probably only pull once just to be on the safe side.  That is assuming a pretty pessimistic rate of leveling his skill, but it is certainly safer than only saving 40 gems and hoping you actually get the 1/4 chance that people have calculated."

I think your units are just too low level for now. The Hawk training island is not supposed to be easy so just take your time :)  PS: None of my specials are maxed, G3 is at level 3, Mihawk at level 2 and Usopp at level 3, so if yours have a lower cooldown you'll have a much easier time. My Going Merry is maxed though."
OnePieceTC,3db0bw,Ninjafro,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:16:26 2015 UTC,"I did it with Log Luffy, Alvida, GP Usop, Mihawk, Mr. 3. Since G3 is similar, you can use that team aswell. Just stall as much as possible. And use Mr. 3 at Buggy and Usop at Arlong. But you need Usop at Strawhats again. Use Mihawks skill at them aswell. You need either Mr.3 or Usop's skill at Mihawk again. With a strong G3 Team u can kill Mihawk in 2 Turns. And you should level that team to at least all level 50+ your G3 preferable as high as possible. That's how i did it but with Log Luffy it was easier, because his special dealt up to 200k damage to all enemies :o Good Luck!"

OnePieceTC,3db0bw,Calais5,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:32:57 2015 UTC,you need to lvl up your units a bit. but i did it today with double G3 + Jozu + Mihawk + Helmeppo V2 + and GP with that team you dont need skill ups on the specials.you can change Helmeppo for Alvida. also you dont need to rush it just get some levels on your units and try to get it sometimes when you feel like you could do it.
OnePieceTC,3db0bw,DJ_Hamster,0,Tue Jul 14 22:51:40 2015 UTC,"Your units are a bit low level. I can't see your PSY units but if you have GP Usopp, I'd recommend double G3, Alvida, Mihawk, Usopp and Jozu."

I think you might very well be the first few if not the first in global to have max'd out Mihawk's boat.  I think I'll take it easy on this boat, Merry max'd out for me is more than I can ask for. I'd rather save my concentration for tomorrow night's Sugo. Only reason why I would continue to go hard on Kalifa's isle is to max out my Jozu, which is only one more special level away.  Got a bit carried away but either way congrats dude. The new boat is sick. Hopefully there are more opportunities to bust out the slasher team in the future."

But you got a bunch of gems so, if those gems were bought then i'd suggest do a few pulls, then use gems to refill and try to get to 80 stamina before mihawk returns, then max mihawk special.

Besides, I will keep 10 for box or anything urgent need. The rest, it is all your call. You all in, or you stop after being happy about what you pull. I will at most do 60gem pulls, no matter what.

Save 40-50 gems being totally pessimistic expecting your luck to be outragously bad on mihawk skill ups (considering its 2x skill up it shouldnt take 50 unless your cursed) then blow 110-115 on sugo.   This'll likely get you a few nice pulls, a maxed mihawk and with any luck leave you with a nice small stockpile of 5-20 gems, depending on your mihawk luck, for refills, box increases (heres to hoping bandai give it us with 2.2, doubt it though.) and lobster isle later this event to stock up on lobsters for those new characters you pull on sugo :P"

OnePieceTC,3da5dk,Duk0,5,Tue Jul 14 18:24:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you're probably better of pulling and just doing enough Mihawk runs to get him and maybe get a skill-up here and there.  70 isn't really all that worthwhile for refilling, unless you're willing to refill, fight him once, wait 100 minutes, fight him again, then refill again."

OnePieceTC,3da5dk,Azzac96,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:00:04 2015 UTC,"Since we have a RateUp event, you should not need more than 60 Mihawks to max his special. With 80 Stamina (or more) this are 30 Gems.  So, I think you should be fine if you save ca. 35-40 (just in case you need more or you fail during the battle)"
OnePieceTC,3da5dk,vanminhu,0,Tue Jul 14 18:27:43 2015 UTC,Are you sure ? Since you use 5 mihawks in one power up right ? If you don't get a skill level up then you lose 5 mihawks. While most people have around 80-119 stam so they can just get 2 mihawks from one gem. So 2 gems= 4 mihawks. Or do you use like 3 mihawks in one power up ?
OnePieceTC,3da5dk,Azzac96,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:33:13 2015 UTC,"your getting pretty unlucky on spec up to not get a skill up in 5 mihawks, i think most people experience 1 in 3 or 1 in 4 as an average on spec up events, this seems to be the consensus throughout the community anyway. i'd say with 30 you could be riding your luck a little, you'll probably max him but take account for some disappointment and 40 should be more than a big enough cushion for bad luck."
OnePieceTC,3da5dk,Azzac96,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:50:20 2015 UTC,Well 40 gems is like 80 Mihawks. So assuming you have bad luck you max him with 5 mihawks in 20 times powering  up.
OnePieceTC,3da5dk,Azzac96,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:02:07 2015 UTC,"your forgeting free stamina from level ups, as you said most are in the 80-119 stam range, if your only the lower-middle end of that your gonna level up probably around 10 times, give or take a few depending on level and luck, that accounts for another 20 mihawks. for example, i maxed Garp on spec up event and it took 76 Garps, i believe i spent 26-27 gems and levelled from around 131-140 at the time, not 100% accurate but its in that region from what i remember. assuming you account for bad luck 40 gems for people around these levels actually gives you around 100 mihawks to play with, not 80"
OnePieceTC,3da5dk,HeadBreaker,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:11:55 2015 UTC,"more actually since i got around 10 level ups from 26-27 gems, from 40 it'd be more like 12-15 level ups which is closer to 110 mihawks."

OnePieceTC,3da5dk,its_0nly_smellz,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:21:33 2015 UTC,"hmm, is it 70 or like 75+? because if its reasonably close to 80 you'll get those levels while maxing him which'll help, as for how many it'll take if your doing one 40 and one 30 all day, i dont really know and i wouldn't like to say, it then really does come down to luck since your relying on those 30 stam runs to give you mihawks consistently. really it could jump quite significantly and actually become somewhat ridiculous, if your closer to 80, it shouldnt be too outradgeous and will cost you 10-20 gems more at most probably. this is all speculative though, i never farmed a raid boss pre 80 stam so im not the guy to ask for specific advice on the matter.  Check a few more of these threads out, im sure there'll be someone who's farmed at 70 stamina and can give you a first hand account of their experience."

OnePieceTC,3d7or0,Donkeyshounen,1 point,Tue Jul 14 04:06:14 2015 UTC,So basically stick to old Arlong if you have him? :P
OnePieceTC,3d7or0,grouchylady,1 point,Tue Jul 14 04:51:04 2015 UTC,"His evolved stats seem pretty on par with old Arlong, so I'd say depends on what you're using him for/if you can get his special down. It's also likely that his evolved capt boost is 2x (young Zeff vs old Zeff was similar -- unevolved, young Zeff was only a 2x boost but evolves to the same 2.5x, though he has the disadvantage of an HP condition for that boost). But I mean, with Mihawk/Doffy around you shouldn't be using him as a captain anyway. :P"
OnePieceTC,3d7or0,megamerman,1 point,Tue Jul 14 04:55:41 2015 UTC,old arlong if you willing to trade a little bit of health for a little more damage and new arlong if you want more health and a little less damage in and in a pure force team i would prefer using new arlong

OnePieceTC,3d9210,CuantosAnosTienes,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:39:50 2015 UTC,"I'm looking at a similar team, just slightly lower levels (but I have turtles saved for such an occasion).  Out of curiousity, do you have a Coby V2?  Blamenco has a somewhat reliable orb change (at least for one of the turns) to prevent you from getting nailed by Coby's negative effect.  With a G3 partner, you aren't getting the full effect from Morgan/G2 anyway, and Coby can turn a good orb turn into a terrific one.  With a G3/Arlong/Blamenco with matching orbs assuming a level 50 G3 friend, Coby's special can make that an over 700k damage round.  That's about 60% of his health.  With Morgan at Level 50, even with Morgan and Alvida having orbs in addition to G3/Arlong/Blamenco, that's just over 500k (503).  You HP may suffer slightly though, depending on Coby's level, but I asked this question some time ago and a few commenters highly recommended the Coby version of the team."
OnePieceTC,3d9210,Ezrius,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:53:45 2015 UTC,"Yes I do, at a relatively higher level too (prepping for Zephyr). So you would suggest replacing Morgan for CobyV2?"

OnePieceTC,3d5cli,bitereality,5,Mon Jul 13 17:27:55 2015 UTC,"I thought I would try plugging this into the damage calculator to see the numbers.  Assumptions:   Have maxed Merry for 1.5x ATK All units are max level All orbs match We are attacking a PSY unit The damage will only account for the first turn of specials due to Robin being 1 turn long and that orbs are not guaranteed for the second turn unless you farmed and can use the combo on the second turn. In a perfect world Zephyr would deal his damage twice.   Team 1: Nami, Nami, Robin, Broggy, Marine, Coby  http://gyazo.com/e5f01f436a01a516acf62b76ff642a67  Team 2: Zephyr, Zephyr, Tsuru, Broggy, Marine, Coby  http://gyazo.com/8b8234ec1a5b1e6bf89eafbb5cc4db63  If anyone sees any errors be sure to correct me and I can run it again.   Edit: I noticed the 6th digit in both total damages are cut off in the chart and a multiplier mistake with Broggy and Coby so I have updated them.  I have added the damage for cases where you only farmed the other captain and used the specials. Broggy and Coby have neutral orbs in this case.  Nami team  http://gyazo.com/d2b1c15d32ae3786bd9b9af201adba99  Zephyr team  http://gyazo.com/fea0e213a91a04bcd7c5fcc99c4e6d2e"
OnePieceTC,3d5cli,PhantomBaselard,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:09:47 2015 UTC,"Nice, and thanks for the numbers, though i'd like to make 2 notes in your assumptions, well really just one which will affect the second.  with an all orb match hypothetical for just 1 turn it kind of gives the robin team their optimum scenario. But even with that i think the completely farmable zeph team does give a good showing to only be 200k short. And outside the hypothetical which is kind of skewered towards robin, zeph int burst team is the easier more assured run when rng comes into play.  Also, if you don't mind, could you run the second damage case for zeph with zeph team using the coby zeph specials with the one orb on first turn and then the broggy marine special giving them 3 matching orbs on the second turn since thats what would be done in a run.  Thanks once again"
OnePieceTC,3d5cli,PhantomBaselard,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:29:23 2015 UTC,Here is the damage of the second turn in the case of being able to save your Broggy+Marine special combo. This assumes 3 matching INT orbs and 3 neutral orbs.  http://gyazo.com/56c8567973df4817caaa6c986aa11788  This turn can occur after either of the cases I linked before.

OnePieceTC,3d5cli,PhantomBaselard,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:31:45 2015 UTC,"thanks for the numbers and the damage calc link, i'll use the damage calc to check the numbers for one farmed orb on marine at first turn with the zeph coby special, then the 3 orbs from the broggy+marine special on 2nd turn, lv 70 units since that scenario should be easily achievable in the game and the first matching orb on the marine would net the lowest damage."
OnePieceTC,3d5cli,PhantomBaselard,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:45:48 2015 UTC,"thanks, i think the previous case was with 4 orbs one farmed and the other 3 from special. I'm bad at explaining, was hoping to see damage from 1 farmed orb alone on the zeph, then the 3 from broggy+Marine special combo which you just posted. And now i know i'm being a bother but could you do it with lv 70 units instead i just want to see how easy it will be to reach 2.1 million, garps health, in 2 turns. So maybe put the farmed orb on the marine since he has the lowest damage so we have a worst case scenario. Its a lot to ask. Thanks either way"

This was actually really helpful considering how like most people I was also conflicted on whether or not I should farm zephyr and this really helps with the discussion.  Zephyr active skill: 30 - 16 turns  Robin active skill: 17 - 12 turns  as a max skill zephyr you'd likely have the same speed to setup as a base Robin. Unless the raid requires an under 16 turn CD for specials then zephyr would be the stronger choice.  Also I know this is more of a team comp analysis but a side note for players who already have tnami/robin comps, Zephyr makes an incredible sub too with his whopping 3.7k health and 1.2k atk. So definitely can't go wrong investing in one."
OnePieceTC,3d9mm4,Dish4330,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:05:46 2015 UTC,"For a psy team I'd say have Shanks as a lead, with Marco, Garp, GP usopp (or impact dial) and then coby or mr 2.  There's probably better psy teams you could pull off but that's the one that immediately grabs my eye. Urogue would be good if you had him. The reason I suggest a Psy team is that they're neutral to every type except int, which they're both weak and strong vs. So this makes them a strong team, but overall it's a pretty weak type compared to some others.   TL;DR Psy teams are pretty good, they're my favourite kind, can clear most things with them with relative ease. Use your impact dial Usopp primarily, but if you feel you'd need the GP or just prefer it, run that."

OnePieceTC,3d847h,monaco1957,-1,Tue Jul 14 21:50:48 2015 UTC,"is there a chance to beat the training forest without g3 or mihawk ?  i only have a vista int team with robin , buggy , chopper , mister 3  or a garp psy team with mr 2 an urouge   i also have chars like jozu , smoker ,alvida , gp usopp"
OnePieceTC,3d847h,ghostaudio,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:35:45 2015 UTC,Most likely not. High damage teams are a must for this isle. You're at a good start but you'll need a strong captain ability (3x) multiplier at least to even have a chance.  Honestly if you don't even have Mihawk then it's really not worth spending time on. Merry is a much more better choice right now since it is far more versatile.  Players that do not have Mihawk or a strong slasher team really shouldn't focus too much on trying to get the coffin boat and more on getting Merry to max rank first.
OnePieceTC,3d81uk,Oedipustrexeliot,7,Tue Jul 14 06:08:49 2015 UTC,"The Coffin boat is obviously good for any slasher team, but it really shines with a Double Doflamingo lead. It gives you 6x the HP, which for the most part translate to between 70,000 to 80,000 HP.  Unless you are running a specific kind of team, generally the importance of stat goes ATK -> HP -> RCV."
OnePieceTC,3d81uk,troubled_bison,2,Tue Jul 14 06:18:39 2015 UTC,Well right now you could enjoy that HP with double Ashura Zoro and a bunch of DEX slasher subs.  Edit: example http://i.imgur.com/TEY6UEH.png
OnePieceTC,3d81uk,_Madara_,1 point,Tue Jul 14 06:29:55 2015 UTC,"True. You could also pull it off with Double Vista and some INT slashers like Buggy, Broggy, Helmeppo etc.  I think your example is the better one though because DEX has better slashers."
OnePieceTC,3d81uk,troubled_bison,1 point,Tue Jul 14 06:39:07 2015 UTC,"Ah, that makes much more sense.  I was thinking that for mihawk 13k vs 20k would be a difference, but not the biggest deal ever.  For doflamingo though I can see why it makes sense."
OnePieceTC,3d81uk,Adrales,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:37:16 2015 UTC,"It's not mandatory, for a good slasher team you can have a good slasher team with out it, but it dose make a decent difference,not the biggest, but I think its better overall even with no RCV(Slasher barely have RCV already) You'll do fine with normal merry no need to rush getting it."
OnePieceTC,3d81uk,koryuken,1 point,Tue Jul 14 06:19:25 2015 UTC,The coffin boat basically gives slashers (the only strong f2p team) a way to clear most raid bosses. Many times this will not be possible with a 1.5 Merry (ie Enel).
OnePieceTC,3d81uk,eDOTiQ,0,Tue Jul 14 06:59:03 2015 UTC,"It's this good: http://imgur.com/TVbegSg  Bragging asside, using a normal slasher team with the coffin boat was MUCH MORE easy than with maxed merry. It's nuts"

OnePieceTC,3d5vnv,Dantia_,6,Mon Jul 13 19:40:02 2015 UTC,The fastest way to clear for beginners is using the marine team (all 5 coloured marines) their easily farmable in logue town. You use thier tandem special to clear each level. Just farm for tandem orbs. The turtle drops are predetermined so it doesnt matter who you attack.
OnePieceTC,3d5vnv,rafilfc,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:46:26 2015 UTC,Thank you! Will try to farm for these.

OnePieceTC,3d5vnv,rafilfc,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:28:51 2015 UTC,Is there any way to set it to yellow turtle time also?
OnePieceTC,3d5vnv,ElderGodEli,1 point,Tue Jul 14 11:22:04 2015 UTC,The yellow turtle times was a 1 week event. We only have purple turtles each week.
OnePieceTC,3d5vnv,beardedheathen,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:18:54 2015 UTC,Ahhh got it
OnePieceTC,3d5vnv,Kinnikufan,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:31:32 2015 UTC,you can also use the black cat pirates. they are useful for vivi laboon teams as well
OnePieceTC,3d5vnv,Oedipustrexeliot,4,Mon Jul 13 20:25:20 2015 UTC,"First, there are a few great ways to drop turtles faster:  Fullbody - Farmable from Baratie 2.  Once evolved, he has a special with a cool-down of 10 turns that deals 200 fixed damage, which is excellent for the Elder Turtles.  Tandem Teams - The marines that are farmable in Shells Town and Logue Town have a team attack that deals fixed damage to all enemies when you get a TND orb with one of them and follow the attack pattern shown.  You need all 5 different colored marines at the same evolution for it to work.  There are also a few pirate groups with the same attack, but marines seem to be easiest to farm consistantly.  x2, x2.5, x3, x3.5 Captains - Captains like Garp, Marco, and Shanks are great for the Black Turtles that we get every Monday.  G3 Luffy is also useful if you happen to have him.  Unfortunately these are all characters that are hard to obtain, so probably not your go-to units if you're new to the game.  Second, some people with way more credibility than me can chime in here, but popular belief is that drops are predetermined when you enter a stage, so it doesn't matter what enemy you start your attack against, the same one will always drop.  Hope this helps!"
OnePieceTC,3d5vnv,Ninjafro,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:47:33 2015 UTC,"Thank you! I have Marco 5* in my team but I havent really used him that much since he costs so much, will try to stack psy units my next run. The Tandem teams seem interesting, will look into it.  Yeah I tried experimenting with targeting and kill order but it does seem like the droprate is predetermined."
OnePieceTC,3d5vnv,Ninjafro,3,Mon Jul 13 19:57:14 2015 UTC,"If you have Asura zoro you probably have been playing long enough that you could have been getting turtle island all week.  Unfortunately the event just ended, but if you search ""turtle time calculator"" there will be a program that tells you when your turtle time and event turtle times (when applicable) are scheduled to happen."
OnePieceTC,3d5vnv,bitereality,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:46:33 2015 UTC,I started playing last thursday. How can I get Turtle Island all week? Is this a different island than the one you get on mondays for 30 minutes twice?
OnePieceTC,3d5vnv,FellatioRex,3,Mon Jul 13 19:55:07 2015 UTC,"From time to time we get additional turtle times (e.g. different colours) for multiple days, but these are limited time events on global. Normally, it's just purple turtles 2x 30min on Mondays for now. Make sure to do run the stage as often as possible when the time comes, it will really give your crews a boost :)  As other people have said, the preferred teams for turtle time are:   Mihawk teams with evolved Fullbody PSY teams, i.e. Marco or Shanks (Fullbody optional) Fixed damage specials (e.g. DJ Sanji, Vista, Fullbody, etc) or fixed damage tandems (e.g. Marine tandem) G3 teams work too if you have him"
OnePieceTC,3d5vnv,Ironman2131,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:17:57 2015 UTC,Thank you! Is there anywhere I can check when these potential extra turtle islands spawn?
OnePieceTC,3d5vnv,FellatioRex,2,Mon Jul 13 20:32:28 2015 UTC,"If you go to this website, you'll get your Monday turtle times for the next 2 weeks. The time zone should set automatically but make sure it's correct and enter the 6th digit of your ID (you'll find it in ""find friends"" on the app).  Now, if you want to check for extra turtle times, go to the ""event"" section of the website. You should see your times if something is scheduled. They are usually announced in advance from within the app though, check the news from the seagull on the adventure navigation menu."

OnePieceTC,3d5vnv,MSC_Jake,4,Mon Jul 13 21:15:47 2015 UTC,"You can oneshot turtles if the attack is high enough or using a fixed damage special (Diable Sanji, Fullbody, Vista, etc).  Most people run Marco or Mihawk teams with high attack units so they can 1 shot the turtles.  The elder turtle pretty much needs a high damage PSY unit with a Marco captain and a matching orb at the very least.  Drops are supposedly predetermined, so attack in whatver pattern u wish."
OnePieceTC,3d5vnv,rafilfc,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:44:26 2015 UTC,"I do have Marco 5 stars but I haven't used him much since he costs so much, still try to a different team next run."
OnePieceTC,3d5vnv,Tvingman,6,Mon Jul 13 19:53:44 2015 UTC,"Even pairing Marco with yellow crabs and dragons, plus Usopp, will work if you have a friend Marco.  One issue you'll have, starting so recently, is that you likely don't have Fullbody to take care of the elder at the end.  So it might make more sense to put together a marine team for now."
OnePieceTC,3d5vnv,zer0limit,3,Mon Jul 13 20:15:19 2015 UTC,"As someone suggested, farm the marine tandem team.  A Marco PSY team will be much faster but this is currently your best choice as it stands."

OnePieceTC,3d3vmc,grouchylady,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:28:23 2015 UTC,"First team: Yes, I don't remember what levels you need though. Use a damage calculator.  Second team: If you're going the orb manipulation route, I'd ditch Alvida instead of Arlong. More important though is make sure you're consistent with hitting perfects on whoever you take."
OnePieceTC,3d3vmc,rafilfc,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:01:25 2015 UTC,Your first team you can hit mihawk for 275k w/o orbs. Your 2nd team sanji sub for alvida you be getting 260k. This is provided you have 1.5x merry if not it drops down to 220k and 210k respectively (with 1.2xmerry). Its also assuming your hitting all perfects

OnePieceTC,3d3vmc,grouchylady,2,Tue Jul 14 23:21:26 2015 UTC,"With a G3 lead you don't need a STR only crew. Mihawk is REALLY easy as long as the last three hit him hard. So your crew looks fine to me (would be safer with higher levels on your reds though, also depends a bit on your boat); I'd pick the rest based on skill cooldowns, HP, or RCV.  edit to clarify that since you're using Coby, you should be fine as is, but make sure you know how to farm orbs (Krieg might be better than Smoker now that I think about it)"

OnePieceTC,3d3vmc,grouchylady,2,Thu Jul 16 21:15:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's not bad to begin with IMO (Mihawk will always come back again anyway) -- 25 turns is already pretty good for fortnights.

OnePieceTC,3d3vmc,ikos36,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:43:33 2015 UTC,THIS Team should be able to do him easily.  The way you go about doing it:  You try and save as many Red Orbs as you can on your STR Characters and stall for Sanji's special. On the fourth Round you use his special to clear the stage.  Im not 100% certain about GP Usopp's and Coby's specials but they should be up when you are facing Mihawk. So if you have some Red Orbs you use Cobys special (even 1 is enough to justify using his specuial IMO).  You should be able to clear him easily if you hit your perfects. Also Watch out for his pre-emptive and good luck.
OnePieceTC,3d3vmc,rockharderrocker2,1 point,Wed Jul 15 12:31:03 2015 UTC,"Fantastic, thanks!  Any tips on when to stall? Other than Alvida, all my units are at base level cooldown unfortunately :/"

A lot of people are bringing Coby for potential orb boost; Jozu's another good choice to give you another extra turn (which you probably won't need with your levels), but you can basically bring fodder in that last slot and still beat him with ease. Even Alvida can probably be swapped out.  Just practice in the training forest for a bit if you're nervous about the perfects. You have a Mihawk so I assume you're familiar with the stages and when to stall/how much HP to go into the boss level with."

Get a G3 friend (>50), and bring: G2, skinny Alvida, Arlong, GP Usopp, and one more character you're comfortable hitting perfects with.

Kidd would have opened up some interesting options too if you'd had time to level/evolve him. Maybe next time!  I think it's possible to run G2/G2 (or G2/Blamenco) successfully on the 30-s version (and vaguely remember someone pulling it off on 40, but with a maxed merry and pretty high levels), but you'll have to check a damage calculator, and even without G3 hitting perfects consistently will be to your benefit.

OnePieceTC,3d3vmc,grouchylady,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:37:46 2015 UTC,"for 30 or 40? 30 is ironically more difficult to stall for some people (crab is best iirc, hit it with combo 4 characters like Arlong).  40 has the really easy option of stalling on the penguin (3 turn cooldown and only hits for a bit over 800, I think the exact number was 852) -- kill the marine and then just keep tapping with Usopp until you're ready. Of course take your time on the previous stages too, esp the turtles, but make sure you only get hit on the penguin stage."

OnePieceTC,3d3vmc,grouchylady,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:33:09 2015 UTC,"Ah, makes sense then. A lot of people (who handled 40 with ease) were taken off guard by 30 the first time Mihawk came around because of the stalling issue.  Just checked and crab is definitely the best place to stall -- it hits for 1300 and has a really long cooldown. If you have enough meat saved up, the single turtle stage is probably also ok, but you don't want to get hit too much there. I think the lock stage is most important to be careful with on 30 though, since you probably have at least two combo 4 characters (Arlong and friend G3?). Target the purple guy first and then miss with your high combo characters; you may have to take a hit there, so just watch your HP on the previous stages."
OnePieceTC,3d3vmc,gallosh11,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:35:25 2015 UTC,"Yup. You right. If I use the 4 combo characters on the same one and miss with the rest, I think I should be ok since all my other characters have a 6 or higher combo).  Thanks for all your help!"

I suggest running 30 stam with your Wolf Stream Zoro and a 72+ Vivi friend. Can bring whatever you want, but obviously strong STR attackers will make it faster. After you get your first Mihawk, you can switch out one of the attackers to make it faster; you could probably try a burst team with the Zoro on 40 stam at that point too for decent farming speed (Zoro, G2 Luffy, Arlong, Mihawk, Sogeking -- save specials for when Mihawk hits 20% HP), but you may need to do some calculations to make sure you can burst him down in time."

OnePieceTC,3d3vmc,pinballwiz,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:08:06 2015 UTC,"Does anyone know if you can stall with a Vivi / LS Zoro team with just Vivi attacking on round 5 until all your specials are ready?  Assuming her attack is around 1175 at level 72 it should deal less than 20k damage to Mihawk stalling for 15+ rounds so I would assume this strategy would work.  Considering I am probably going to do 80+ runs, if I could breeze through stages 1 - 4 and then wait on 5 I think that I could farm him quicker.    Thoughts?"
OnePieceTC,3d3vmc,grouchylady,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:31:44 2015 UTC,"Vivi's attack does not ever reach anywhere near 1175. XD  I... am not sure I'm understanding your question correctly so let me know if I misread, but just attacking normally will get your specials up in time (no way are you going to whittle down his HP that far that quickly). There's no need to stall in the previous stages.  In fact, you SHOULD be attacking normally (a couple of us tried normal attack rounds vs. tapping and waiting for specials on Garp and it seems it's slightly faster to attack normally if your characters have the color advantage). If you want to use specials earlier, you can, but with 40-s Mihawk you need to be careful to have them all up again by the time he hits 20%."
OnePieceTC,3d3vmc,pinballwiz,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:47:49 2015 UTC,"Thanks, that answers my question exactly.  The 1,175 came from a level 72 vivi attack (619) plus a 1.9 multiplier.

OnePieceTC,3d3vmc,OPTCBail,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:16:54 2015 UTC,"switch out impact for gp usopp,  shanks for mr. 2, and run as daouiach said. heres a vid of what the run should look like   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8Pzi0T3Qf8&index=12&list=PLXfucIDqiDplsDBqlcSlrO1iCxyCeGXQ9  the units are 90 which is why he only needed 1 meat orb after tanking first zeph hit, but i think you should be able to get away with 80 (need 2 meat orbs) 70 3 meat orbs maybe 4. If you dont tank that 3rd hit and gem revive you are pretty much guaranteed garp.  2 edits for an easier run than the vid,    If your bonclay special is 10 turns or less burst with one garp special and bonclay on your first turn with zeph. Dont use coby special. You should only do this if you'll only need 1 meat orb to tank the 3rd zeph hit. use your urogue special with coby when you are ready to burst down zeph   oh and dont use your usopp special until after youve tanked zephyrs 3rd hit. goodluck get 2nd opinion"

Here and here is my box, I got a few PSY's but nothing special."
OnePieceTC,3d3vmc,Swaglord_No1,1 point,Tue Jul 14 06:54:06 2015 UTC,"What do you mean with overreaching? In LS Zoro/Vivi teams your health can be as high as you want.  If you try 40 stamina with that team, you are most likely going to loose once you get Zephyr to below 20%HP. He will attack you for 36k damage every 3 turns; which means that even a maxed Vivi can't heal you up in time. But it is possible if you evolve your Alvida and put her in your team instead of the yellow lobster. I posted a possible solution to safely get by this phase here. Though you need to make sure that your team has over 7200 HP since you have to take some of those 36k damage hits which are reduced by LS Zoro's captains ability down to 7200 damage."
OnePieceTC,3d3vmc,joshman113,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:15:47 2015 UTC,"I forget what my logic was with the Lobster. Probably just a brain fart thinking it's the same as Laboon. Yeah I can evolve Alvida in time easily, just need some money and I can spend some Black Adult Turtles on her and then get her a bit higher. On the same note I just need a rainbow penguin for Mihawk and since Zephyr's time hasn't even been announced I think I got plenty of time. That last 20% thing, that sounds tough.  I think what I'm gonna do is just do the 30 stam which gives me a 50% of getting him per run, correct? Gem it for stamina if need be.  But then this sounds fantastic, LS Zoro/Vivi, Mihawk, Mirage Nami, Alvida and GP Usopp."

Lv 1) Friend Captain: Whitebeard (Lv 58, Sp. Lv 1) Mihawk (Lv 63, Sp Lv MAX) Alvida (Lv 40, Sp Lv 1) Mr. 3 (Lv 43, Sp Lv 1) Golden Pound Usopp (Lv 46, Sp Lv 1)  The stages went a bit like this.. Stage 12: Used Mihawks Special and cleared Buggy and clowns in 1 turn Stage 13: Used Alvida's Special because they both had a 1 turn attack Stage 14: Target Pearl, Gin, then Krieg Stage 15: Used Mr. 3. Target Arlong, then Hachi Stage 16: (This one was tricky, I had to keep repeating until Mr. 5 had a 2 turn attack) Use Whitebeard's Special. Target Goldenweek, Mr. 5, Mr. 3, then Monday Stage 17: Used Usopp's Special. Target Tashigi then Smoker. Stall for turns. Stage 18: Take out the crabs. Use Alvida before the Dragon attacks. Stall for turns. Stage 19: Use Mihawk and Whitebeard's Special. Target Sogeking, Nami, Sanji, Zoro, then Luffy. Be sure to have over 2000 HP before clearing. (I went ahead and used Mr. 3 here again to get an extra turn to farm Food + Stall) Stage 20: Used Usopp's Special. Used Whitebeard's Special 1 turn after (which was unnecessary, Mihawk would have been defeated without it anyway)  The run relies heavily on perfects due to units being underleveled.

OnePieceTC,3d3vmc,hunterdaniel1,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:10:29 2015 UTC,Currently the best impact captain x2.5 in the game. And once evolved his stats are awesome max hp 3000 odd and attk 1300ish. Prob the 3rd or 4th best unit you could pull
OnePieceTC,3d3vmc,archevil,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:29:40 2015 UTC,"His captain ability is the impact equivalent to mihawk, I wouldn't say that's average.  Also considering some of the strongest units in the game are impact you can have a really powerful team with a Kidd captain."

OnePieceTC,3d3vmc,Ezrius,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:10:10 2015 UTC,"Don't worry it's the right place  anyway you can use LS zoro + lvl 72-73 vivi friend for mihawk-zephyr  You can do mihawk using g2 + g3 friend team, but you evolved usopp into sogeking. Sogeking needs 20 turns to activate his special while GP usopp only needs 15, so that might pose a problem for u, as long as you know how to stall to get sogeking's special up then you can do mihawk. http://i.imgur.com/zVIuYIP.png  use alvida after mihawk's pre-emp, then use sogeking's = 5 turns to kill him."
OnePieceTC,3d3vmc,archevil,1 point,Thu Jul 16 05:16:50 2015 UTC,Would this team be good enough for mihawk? How are the stalls? http://imgur.com/cF339TS
OnePieceTC,3d3vmc,StandardUS,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:38:11 2015 UTC,unless you are really lucky with food orbs then I think you will have trouble stalling for 15 turns on GP usopp.  Bring a tsuru instead : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbMyvjIUhCI  or go for 2x mihawk team

OnePieceTC,3d3vmc,Atsuroz,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:53:45 2015 UTC,"I'm hoping I can handle Mihawk 40 stamina with this Blamenco team (this would be an example of one of my lower level G3 friends).  If I can get orbs via Blamenco or luck, Coby's potential (for the top 3 damage dealers) looks like this.  I have some turtles saved up, so if this isn't feasible I can probably pump up Blamenco and/or Arlong a bit as well.  I have Diable Sanji, but thought getting a full extra turn from Alvida may be more important than the better chances of orb matching he'd provide.  My calculations have it at 5 turns as-is if I can hit my perfects, and significantly less (2) if I can hit my perfects and get the Coby/Orb boost dream.  Seems like it would take maxing Arlong to get it down to 4 turns and I don't see that happening.  Any input?"
OnePieceTC,3d3vmc,Komen1,2,Wed Jul 15 20:59:11 2015 UTC,"mihawk has 1.180.000 hp, you will have 5 turns to kill him, based on your 1st pic then you can kill him within those 5 turns. IMO just use those turtles before mihawk to raise your damage :)"

I do not need any more Mihawk mains. Also I use G3 not often enough to be looking for any G3 mains.  Mostly I need some Kid friends, best case would be Kid, Wb, Marco.   ID: 597 224 533"

However its not a big deal, turn it off and everything is fine.. Remember with android you get a more custom experience which allows you to do things like change your location so you can do friend games more easily."
OnePieceTC,3d61nq,Levkko,2,Mon Jul 13 21:25:01 2015 UTC,On ios you wont be able to change your gps location unless you jailbreak so barrel breaking is a lot better on android just take that into consideration but other than that there's no real advantage choosing whichever.

The only major difference is probably that you can't fake your location for the friend barrel game unless your device is jailbroken. Other option is to make some extra accounts yourself to use on an emulator for your main account."
OnePieceTC,3d61nq,drawpthebase,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:32:13 2015 UTC,I play on an iphone 5s and nexus 7 gen1 and it runs very smooth on the iphone and laggy on the nexus.  Could be poor optimization or lack of good hardware (though the nexus is supposed to be good here).

IMO, it's superior as a device but inferior as a way to play OPTC compared to an iphone.   I'd keep the note 4 as a phone and get an ipad to play OPTC.

From now on, I keep every unit that isn't easily farmable (ones with names).  Coby and Helmeppo for sure have missions tied to them, and so do Ms. Monday, Higuma, and Momoo, so keep them at least.

They also drop quite readily from the friend pulls and future/repeating fortnights. Unless you want a particular boat (Alvida's or Buggy's), there's no pressing need to finish the missions."

OnePieceTC,3d3lsv,itspabo,3,Mon Jul 13 06:34:59 2015 UTC,"145 gems here (rolled twice during the 1st Supernovas batch, got Urouge and stopped, didn't roll at all during the last Sugofest since I already got Whitebeard), I plan to make a maximum of 5-7 rolls (less if I get something I want before) and call it a day.  As I'm approaching pirate level 150, the fact that a single Rare Recruit costs me 15 runs on current Fortnight Island's Expert or 10 runs during 24-hour bosses is becoming simply unbearable... sure, it's great pulling off a rare unit, but it's even greater having less rare but stronger units and maybe dropping 1 or 2 fruits during Turtle Times to power up everyone.  My way of thinking was quite the opposite during my first days as, since I had not many units, the gacha-only ones were a lot more attractive and I gladly spent all my premium currency on Strawhats v2, Baroque Works batch and the first Whitebeard Sugofest.  The more you play, the stronger units you get playing (from bosses and Fortnight islands), the more your way of looking at those rainbow fruits changes, I guess, so Sugofests become less and less appealing. At least in my case :)"
OnePieceTC,3d3lsv,Junpei77,2,Mon Jul 13 14:18:10 2015 UTC,"I agree, but you are lucky enough to pull both WB and G3, so you are less desperate than many other players. Also, you didn't roll last sugo because you have WB, but what about for those who didn't have a WB or any decent units? First five pulls were silvers, with no decent units on the team, would you stop there? Other than that, I completely agree with what you said, but the bottom line is, you have to be lucky to get a couple good units with 5-7 pulls."
OnePieceTC,3d3lsv,BankaiKenpachi,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:18:09 2015 UTC,"As it is always a matter of God Coby's will, you could get lucky with your first two pulls or get all silver posters with 1000... my point is that the game already gives you plenty of strong units through other means and the power level difference is not overwhelming, so you can actually think about balancing your fruits stash between pulls and refills instead of going all out with the former, and still manage to build a competitive team. Also, I'm usually a big pessimist, so if I get all silvers or dupes with my first pulls I tend to think of being on a bad streak and quit reducing the damage, rather than keep trying and potentially waste more fruits, and that's because I'm a full F2P player so I have to choose carefully how to spend my resources... but to each his own mindset, I'm just too coward to be a good gambler and I do prefer a safer approach ;)"

OnePieceTC,3d3lsv,NeLk42,0,Mon Jul 13 07:08:31 2015 UTC,"what level is your mihawk special? and do you have a consistant way to clear him if he does return?  Your situation is a bit tricky because I would normally suggest that if you were going to spend gems on refills, you should have atleast 80 stamina pool so that 1 gem = 2 runs of a 40stam raidboss. Even though you will probably have enough time to reach that stamina break-point before the next mihawk, I think you might have trouble clearing it consistantly in order to farm for mihawk skillups.  I think your account could do with some stronger lead units but like I mentioned before even though ray, wb, and kidd are great leads, this sugo is more sub focused IMO.  Assuming you'll have 85 gems = 17 rolls. I'd say try your luck with about 5 rolls (i'd do 7 just because I'm OCD and i'd like to even out at 50gems), and then save the remaining gems for Mihawk. Having a pool for 50 gems + another 20 gems via events/new island releases, will probably give you a good pool for refills during mihawk.  EDIT: If you have no way of clearing Mihawk 40stam consistently, I'd save the rest of the gems for better sugo-fest that's more lead oriented (ie. str + sugo w/ supernovas v2 + strawhats v2)"
OnePieceTC,3d3lsv,burnedcoconut,1 point,Mon Jul 13 07:26:27 2015 UTC,"This is one of the best sugo for lead captain with ray, wb, law, kidd and niche one like drake,killer and apu. Theres not a better one then this one. We also have no clue what so ever of when hawk will be back. Theres post on front page of him comming back since april and he never did"
OnePieceTC,3d3lsv,burnedcoconut,0,Mon Jul 13 13:45:58 2015 UTC,"The reason I keep saying this sugo is a great one for subs is because Ray + WB are legendaries so I don't consider them part of the evaluation since all 6* units are great leads.  law and kidd are amazing leads which I've repeated multiple times in replies. Drake is too niche currently to recommend to players looking for more stable team comps, killer gets out dmged by any 2.5x lead, and apu is much better as a sub with law.  I would consider supernova v2 + strawhats v2 (str bonus) a much stronger sugo-fest when it comes to aiming for a lead since it'll increase rates for kidd, g3, and wb. With the current limited sugo units it's bound to happen int he next couple of iterations.  Even though Mihawk raid is only just speculation, it's still a better general rule of thumb to hold 50 gems in the pocket in case he gets surprise announced than to spend them on a sugo only to regret not having gems to refill for it if it comes up."
OnePieceTC,3d3lsv,burnedcoconut,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:17:13 2015 UTC,"Highly doubt their will ever be a strawhat v2+ super nova 2 str sugo, like ever and you said it yourself wb doest count in the sugo you only added him because of a very unlikely str un a sugo that wont ever happen. Apu drake and killer are all great lead for the upcomming fortnight in a global context where good lead are few. It seems unreasonable to suggest something to someone purely based of speculation and not carefully looked at facts. Also killer does more damage then ace as a lead, just sayin"
OnePieceTC,3d3lsv,burnedcoconut,0,Mon Jul 13 14:28:10 2015 UTC,"I'm naming that sugo combination purely as an example, and tbh i don't see why it can't happen. There's been no specific rotation of sugos on global so I'm pretty sure any combination is up for grabs, it all depends what the devs feel like.  I don't see why it's unreasonable to suggest players save gems for mihawk when his return will come eventually, it doesn't really matter if a player saved the 50 gems now or 50 gems later, the important fact is that they have 50 gems available when it's announced so why not play it safe and keep it in the pocket for when it does come back? I don't really see how that mentality counts as ""not carefully looked at facts"". The Mihawk was one of the first raidbosses to arrive on global. It only makes sense that there's a higher probability that they re-launch mihawk raid before one of the other 3.  Currently the only released raids on Global are mihawk, MC, Garp. If zephyr is the next one to come up that's fine too you can always still keep the gems for when mihawk DOES come back which in all likely hood will probably be the rotation right afterwards. It wouldn't make sense for them to re-launch Garp a 2nd time so close to the first iteration.  Also killer dmg: http://i.imgur.com/kbtZmk4.jpg"
OnePieceTC,3d3lsv,Uchiha92,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:00:13 2015 UTC,Global sugo have always followed japan so far so yes it wont happen. And 50 gem is unreasonable as it take about 60 to max mihawk which is 30 gem at 80 stam assuming his is lvl 1. Its also bad advice to tell someone not to pull when pulling will help him clear futur stuff. He wont be happy to have saved all those gem if he cant to the upcomming fortnigh. Bad advice or ignorance either way you dont know your stuff
OnePieceTC,3d3lsv,Mordecaibest,-1,Mon Jul 13 16:43:53 2015 UTC,"your level of butt hurt is firstly baffling and secondly amusing to me. At no point did I claim to be an expert, this thread is literally named [unofficial]. I literally replied to somebody saying that I'm simply relaying my own take on the subject.  Special skill ups are never finite I don't see why you would assume that 60 is the magic number when there's no math to support that claim. I'm basing my estimates off of the vocal majority on this reddit itself AND planning for the worst case scenario. At NO POINT have I ever claimed that it is REQUIRED to save up 50 gems, it is a worst case scenario situation.  The argument between using gems for pulls and using gems to skill up a raidboss has always been the same. You're always SAFER to save gems for skill ups than to risk it on RNG so you have no basis on claiming that they would get anything that would help them clear future content (especially not to mention that most of the people who have commented so far already have comps that can easily clear all current and near future content).  You're totally ignoring the fact that you were just flat out WRONG about the killer out damaging 2.5 lead issue so I don't know where you get the right to say that I don't know my stuff when you clearly don't know your math.  IF you're so angry about it then start your own thread giving your own view on the issue. I've gotten no complaints from the players who have asked for my advice. Not to mention the fact that advice is inherently a suggestion, I'm not putting a gun to anybody's head telling them to follow my words. Yet you come in here throwing your ego around thinking that your mindset is the only one that matters? Please check yourself before you wreck yourself.  I've literally replied every argument you'd had so far and you simply keep reiterating the same points which I've countered and proven to simply be flat out wrong. The only points your argument are valid on are the preference to how many gems they should save and even that itself is stupid because I've told everybody that they should follow their own method and my is only a suggestion.  Hey but you know what? you might be right, I might not know my stuff, but at least I know how to form a logical argument and back up my statements rather than throw meaningless words around and add in insults when I don't have proof of concept.  Lack of logic or simple inability to form coherent logic, either way you don't know your stuff."

OnePieceTC,3d3lsv,chansomebuuu,2,Mon Jul 13 12:58:38 2015 UTC,"I would actually suggest you save your gems and just focus on getting to 80 stam pool and wait for mihawk return. Even though you have a good set up to take advantage of any rare recruit since you have WB and G3, Max Skill Mihawk should still take priority over gaining stronger sub units.  With your current setup aside from Rayleigh and Kidd, the rest of the novas won't drastically change your team comps (aside from using them as stat subs for your G3/WB teams.  So my suggestion is to save gems. If you REALLY can't hold back, maybe 2-3 rolls at max just to get your fix and test your luck."

OnePieceTC,3d3lsv,ThirdSlipper,0,Mon Jul 13 08:07:49 2015 UTC,"From my brief look around the forums most people average about 100 mihawks to max level his skill (not during 2x skillup). So 50 refills would probably be worst case scenario (50 refills = 100 mihawks). I would even hold them until the next 2x skillup just to be safe.  You seem to have pretty much most of the strong leads already so I would actually say this sugo is pretty good for your setup, apoo would fit with your dex teams, capone would be great for future QCK teams, Kidd would give you a great striker team. Basically you'd be able to maximize the potential of all the high tier supernovas in terms of using them in a strong comp.  So my suggestion would be:   keep 50 gems for mihawk (assume events and new content will give you about 20 gems for a best case scenario of 70gems) If you're conservative and aiming for the long run, roll 5 times If you're itching for your fix and don't mind some rng, roll 5 - 11 times (you'll have 11 after you save 50 gems for mihawk)"

OnePieceTC,3d5511,KamiLuka,2,Mon Jul 13 16:33:28 2015 UTC,"Unless whatever unit you replace him with is capable of replacing three turns of damage with your gp team in a single turn (either with a great special or amazing stats) he should be on the team.  The only exception to this rule would be bosses who have a debut and can't be stalled by gp usopp.  Edit: a good example of this would be replacing gp usopp with impact usopp in psy burst teams for zephyr. This actually covers both scenarios since zephyr has a debut and since impact usopp gives such a huge boost in power with his special that he can replace the three turns lost by not having gp usopp.  Edit 2: I forgot to include this one, but you will also leave out gp usopp if your team can easily beat whatever stage you're running without his special.  In this case it will be faster to put in another strong unit and go through the level more quickly."

For fortnights and raid bosses that allow him, he will be a staple for almost all teams - main exceptions being INT/PSY burst or Vivi teams.  You may even want to bring him along with a PSY team instead of Impact Usopp if the team isn't bursty enough.  3 additional turns to attack and stall for specials will outweigh a single turn of double damage."

OnePieceTC,3d2zum,koryuken,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:23:39 2015 UTC,"""This team is a 6.25x ATK boost to DEX. Law + Kalifa/Apoo will turn all orbs DEX"".  I don't argue on the Law + Apoo combo, but I bet someone will try to get the Law + Kalifa one, and 2 options will happen: If he uses Khalifa first, the DEX orbs will stay, and the STR ones will be converted either to DEX, Food or Combo.  If Law is used first, then his special won't have any effect, as Khalifa will shuffle them all again, and giving a mixture on STR and DEX. You might still get all 6 green orbs, but you can get all 6 red, will would make Zeff (or Izo) necessary on that team, which is the same as the previous teams discussed.  That is what I call missinformation. I understand that this is Khalifa unit analysis, so don't put her in a team that do not work implying that she might do the job."

OnePieceTC,3d52q6,Uchiha92,5,Mon Jul 13 16:17:01 2015 UTC,Level up your G3 and Mihawk is more worth farming than Zephyr.
OnePieceTC,3d52q6,Kaikrox,3,Mon Jul 13 16:22:00 2015 UTC,glad I'm not the only one thinking that. Thanks!
OnePieceTC,3d52q6,Kinnikufan,5,Mon Jul 13 16:33:35 2015 UTC,"Mihawk for sure.  Zephyr will be useful in the more niche Shooter team, which is a long way from being usable in Global right now.  When Zephyr comes back xx-months from now you can decide whether or not you want to invest time/effort/gems into farming him.  I personally plan to get him a few times, same as I did Garp and Mihawk the first time."
OnePieceTC,3d52q6,condoriano225,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:29:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah I don't think he's that useful in Japan yet. Yeah I may just opt to farming him 2-3 times. Mihawk's is definitely worth the gems, all I need to do now is level my G3 team. Not sure to what minimum level is required though."
OnePieceTC,3d52q6,Kinnikufan,2,Mon Jul 13 16:35:28 2015 UTC,I second this. The guide says nothing about the level requirements of a G3 team. Does anyone knows what's the best/quickest way to farm him?
OnePieceTC,3d52q6,condoriano225,2,Mon Jul 13 16:39:19 2015 UTC,"Quickest way I'm pretty sure is to use Whitebeard or G3, but a Mihawk with a low cool-down is also a way to beat him quickly.  I use G3 because I was lucky enough to get him.  Mine is currently level 60 and I was able to farm Mihawk back when he was around 50.  I used a team of double G3, GP Usopp, Alvida, Smoker, and Arlong.  Arlong could be replaced with Monster Chopper if he's higher level.  Honestly, everyone could probably be replaced with the hardest hitting STR units and be fine if they're high enough levels, but mine aren't, so I play it safe with Def Boosts and Turn Delays."
OnePieceTC,3d52q6,Kinnikufan,2,Mon Jul 13 17:32:24 2015 UTC,That's good to hear. Now I have to try and not spend all my gems in this Sugo.
OnePieceTC,3d52q6,burnedcoconut,3,Mon Jul 13 17:47:35 2015 UTC,Yeah...good luck with that.  I set myself a soft limit of 10 and a hard limit of 11 (depending on what I get after 10) this Sugofest.  I feel like I can stop after that.  I was actually able to hold back from pulling more than once last Sugofest because I knew there wasn't much I could get that was useful.
OnePieceTC,3d52q6,FellatioRex,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:18:28 2015 UTC,Mihawk is the first raid boss and rhe weakest by ALOT not much is needed to clear him. Hes also in the most useful if not the most useful to max out

OnePieceTC,3d52q6,burnedcoconut,2,Mon Jul 13 16:52:39 2015 UTC,"I was able to beat him pretty comfortably with a G3 at 50, Arlong at 50, Alvida at 30, Smoker (4*) at 50, and GP Usopp at 40.  I always took a higher level friend just in case though.  So your units are looking pretty good.  I'd just throw some turtles from this week and next into them and see how things shake out from there, since we have no idea when Mihawk will be back.  EDIT:  40-stamina, by the way."
OnePieceTC,3d52q6,Gunslinger_11,4,Mon Jul 13 17:26:16 2015 UTC,"Mihawk over zeph. Mihawk special is insanely good and will help you out more then zeph will. Mihawk is also  2,5X slasher lead which is, with striker the best teams rifht now. Zeph is a shooter lead but they still need quite a few member to their team. Id say farm zeph as much as you can within the limit of whats resonable and dont blow to many gems on it"

OnePieceTC,3d4t0p,Fuzzy_MI,2,Mon Jul 13 15:04:14 2015 UTC,I'm actually all for this.  Looks like a pretty good build and one that I would certainly try out.  I only really play Global seriously and when Sengoku comes around I'll be trying really hard to get him.
OnePieceTC,3d4t0p,Kinnikufan,2,Mon Jul 13 15:23:24 2015 UTC,lol. exactly what I was thinking for my global strategy.  I have already started saving gems!    Just need some expert opinions on the team layout.
OnePieceTC,3d4t0p,grouchylady,2,Mon Jul 13 15:32:12 2015 UTC,"You know, I pretty much never use Franky for orb changing in my yellow team, but that's mainly because Garp/SW Shanks captains make it pretty pointless/unnecessary. Enel's definitely a good choice, but IDK if he's better or worse than young!Shanks (whose event probably won't be coming back for a while though), and don't forget the PSY boosts don't stack.  I do sometimes run Sengoku friends with my Garp (much less often now that I'm using an evolved Marco in my team), but IDK, the benefit of Sengoku/Buggy ship seem to be the possibility for rainbow teams. If you really wanna go with a yellow team, I wonder if this might be best:   Sengoku (psy boost) with a SW Shanks friend (psy orb rate up) v2 Coby (orb boost) Domino (orb lock, cost 20 but I think that should work?) GP Usopp someone with good stats.   Of course, Sengoku's cooldown is a little long so I guess that's where you'd consider bringing Enel/young Shanks.  (Karu is NOT good for monocolor teams, since he randomizes orbs before the switch.)"

OnePieceTC,3d4opm,Ezrius,2,Mon Jul 13 14:29:18 2015 UTC,A yellow orb on most of those (I'd go with Urouge or Garp)  could break the Elder's defense after a perfect chain. With a bit of luck you won't even need Fullbody. Just make sure you don't miss.

I'm fairly competent with this team, though I haven't used the unevolved Urogue much since I got Garp and I'm a little rough with Fullbody's timing.  I'll probably give it at least one try but I'm glad to hear it's possible."
OnePieceTC,3d4opm,condoriano225,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:39:25 2015 UTC,"Urouge probably needs to be evolved though :) But yeah keeping Fullbody in the team also helps, you know, just in case the orbs get stubborn."

Try leaving Fullbody as a backup and see if you can down the elder with any of your stronger orb-powered units (ie. anyone but Coby): if that works, replace Fullbody with Shanks as soon as you're able to and go full PSY :)"

Even when the Princess Turtle arrives on global (which will likely be a very long way off), there are several Elder Turtles on that map that he may be useful for on turns that you don't have a character that can do fixed damage to multiple enemies (like Diable Jambe Sanji).  He can't kill the Princess Turtle, though.  The new Tilestone unit released with Water 7 might be the only character that can one-shot her, though I'm not super familiar with the Japanese meta."

OnePieceTC,3d2e0m,dtheb91,1 point,Mon Jul 13 09:00:29 2015 UTC,Sugo Pulls are part devil part Rngesus. Last last festival i was so hyped to get TowelNami only one that rly interested me because it was INT rate up and G3 and Wb felt too unrealistic to me. So i pulled and got 5* G3 on my first pull und WB 10 pulls later but no Towel Nami. ^ And Last Sugofest i pulled 15x times to finally get my hands on her as she had her rates up and I got 15x crap pulls. Then i bought up 85 gems and did a last yolofuckyouall pull and got a 5* Towel Nami. tl;dr sugo pulls play with your feels
OnePieceTC,3d2e0m,gargoss,1 point,Mon Jul 13 09:18:40 2015 UTC,I'm prepared to lose a lot of money this time around.

OnePieceTC,3d2e0m,ThCommonGuy,1 point,Mon Jul 13 09:59:09 2015 UTC,I've managed to hoard 127 gems since the first whitebeard sugofest. I've started since the first day this game came out on global and havent pulled anything 'special' from rare recruits. So I hope I get a rayleigh but i'll be happy with any other recruit ( that are special ) I get.  RNGesus visited me yesterday while upgrading my merry to max. So I dont think he will come by again in the same week. But hopes up!

I think:  1- from that on, the xp you need to gain a level would level other characters by a lot .  2- the cost to use manuals (and the manuals XP) is a waste  3- I just like to have more characters to try on, makes the game more fun.   of course that just for characters with good specials, not the 25 atk stuff"
OnePieceTC,3d1i3r,tadabola,3,Sun Jul 12 21:37:35 2015 UTC,"sounds good to me.  apart from the exp and bery waste you have when you max the skill lvl at lvl 99, you miss the chance to get a balanced team. (as you said)  My Garp for example is on lvl 80 and has ca. 2,6kk exp. A total of 5kk is needed fpr lvl 99, so I would have to waste almost the same amount of turtles I already had. (even more since I lvled him during the exp-rate-up) Therefore, I am going to spend my other turtles on weaker chars."
OnePieceTC,3d1i3r,Duk0,1 point,Sun Jul 12 22:41:48 2015 UTC,I think something between 25k - 30k

OnePieceTC,3d3na9,Thagomizery,1 point,Mon Jul 13 06:54:14 2015 UTC,"Personally, I'd keep all of those.  You never know when you'll need older characters.  For instance, when we get missions for Shell Town you'll need Luffy to complete one.  Also, Mr. Prince Sanji is a pretty good lead as he boosts all characters after 2 perfects like a weaker G3 Luffy.  Hachi...probably won't be useful.  Coby is one you'll definitely want after he's evolved and Impact Usopp is also quite good once you have the foundation for a PSY team (a good captain is really what you're lacking there)."

I keep ALL golds.  Got rid of crap like hitachi and kurobi. Things like those I find pointless and common(er) to get if you need them (which I don't think you ever will).  This is also at lvl 70+, under that I would keep everything if you had a bad box and need characters to fill gaps.  In your case I would keep them all and wait for box space...

Can't make a convincing case for Hachi but you never know when you need him.  One thing that I can suggest is keep Ms Valentine and try to get the Billion Blue unit. Both of them will be useful for Kraken island when it comes up which should be only a couple of months away. Also, as a side notes, any fodder units with orb changing ability is worth keeping for the long run as orb changer is always in demand and their special should be easily levelled up."

OnePieceTC,3d14a8,HeadBreaker,6,Sun Jul 12 17:29:16 2015 UTC,"Cotton candies are awesome. They are one of the things I am looking the most forward to in the update. Every time you use a cotton candy, two things happen. The first is that your characters stats will increase. The second is that a number gets added to your character portrait. There are 4 types of cotton candies.  Red ones raise your characters attack by 2. They add a +1 number to your ATK.  Orange ones raise your characters HP by 5. They add a +1 number to your HP.  Green ones raise the characters RCV by 1. They add a +1 number to your RCV.  Gold ones raise your characters ATK, HP, and RCV by 2. They add a +1 number to ATK,HP,RCV. The total number added is 3.  The total maximum number you can reach for a character is +200, and the maximum number for an individual stat is +100.  This means if you are planning to min/max, you shouldn't be feeding green or gold cotton candies to units who don't benefit from the RCV stat. What I am planning to do is to only use red and orange cotton candies for the characters I like. This means they will get a bonus of 500 HP and 200 attack to their stats."

OnePieceTC,3d1uc0,Mugiwaras,6,Sun Jul 12 21:02:40 2015 UTC,This is as good a Sugo as any to pull. I'd go for it
OnePieceTC,3d1uc0,DJ_Hamster,2,Sun Jul 12 21:11:11 2015 UTC,"I'm thinking about it, the Supernovas are pretty tempting. Are any of them good?"
OnePieceTC,3d1uc0,DJ_Hamster,2,Sun Jul 12 21:18:34 2015 UTC,"Of the 10 supernovas available, all of them are very solid with the exception of Bepo. Bonney isn't that great but can act as a poor man's Marco on Garp or (possibly) other tanky teams if paired with a food provider."
OnePieceTC,3d1uc0,Slithicer,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:22:55 2015 UTC,"Bepo is great, once we get Lucci he'll be really good"
OnePieceTC,3d1uc0,DJ_Hamster,0,Mon Jul 13 05:03:52 2015 UTC,"I'm assuming you mean CP9 Lucci and not the upcoming Lucci lol. Bepo will be really good once we get CP9 Lucci for full STR orbs, but seeing as he just came out in JP it'll probably be like almost a year until we get him in Global. In current meta, I think he's probably the least useful of the supernovas (just my opinion)"
OnePieceTC,3d1uc0,S3xybaus,1 point,Mon Jul 13 05:33:20 2015 UTC,"Well bandai has been releasing a new island every month for global meanwhile jp has always been a month and a half to 2 for a new island. So with that in mind we are like 5 months to 7 at the most away from Water 7 island. Also bonnie is actually the worst out of the novas. Why? Because she can act as a marco if you dont have him. The problem is you need meat orbs to pop up. That all depends on RNG so you might get all meat, you might get 1 or 2, and you might just get 0. The only person you can pair her up with are people like dorry, broggy, chopper, and garp to get meat orbs for sure. If you run a burst team of psy with her in it instead of marco the only person to combo her special with would be garp. That would be a waste of garp and mr. 2 special though. That leaves her being a sub in a g3, rayleigh, or wb team but because of her attack youd be wasting those leads by not having more useful sub units then her. Overall she is pretty bad and her special is meh. You really wont ever see it in play nor will you see her being used for awhile either. There really hasnt been a fortnigh in jp where people will go...ohhhh i need bonnie here. Now bepo isnt the greatest either but he actually fits in str teams pretty well since his special along with blamenco can gurauantee you almost a full set of str orbs."
OnePieceTC,3d1uc0,itspabo,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:37:45 2015 UTC,"for the novas Kidd is top tier because he opens the realm for impact teams in Global, and then pretty much every other nova, and rounding out the bottom would be bonney, xdrake, bepo  If you already have Law, Apu sky rockets in usefulness. Capone becomes a very solid and widely used sub later in the game because of his great orb manipulation but currently he's nothing too game breaking. Killer is a great lead for new players because he's easy to use and can blast past story mode content but mathematically any 2.5x lead out scales him in dmg."
OnePieceTC,3d1uc0,Matainer,1 point,Mon Jul 13 04:12:32 2015 UTC,"I would rate X-Drake in the higher tier of them, up with Law, Kid, Apoo, etc. hes the best captain for an Int burst team, and he has quite good stats. better than hawkins for sure"
OnePieceTC,3d1uc0,itspabo,1 point,Mon Jul 13 10:24:39 2015 UTC,"I personally think of X-Drake as a meaty sub (great stats) but a situational/niche lead. His captain ability basically makes him a dark WB which is awesome, but aside from clearing PSY based raidbosses (Garp) there are generally easier and safer methods to clearing most raidbosses than to go with a X-Drake INT Burst team.   It's also because in order to maximize his potential I would say that that the player should already have Robin. All these factors together is why I would rate him at Capone's tier because getting X-Drake by himself will not change your progression path ass opposed to Kidd (Law and Apoo don't really either but only when you already own one of the pair)."
OnePieceTC,3d1uc0,Matainer,1 point,Mon Jul 13 10:30:58 2015 UTC,"Okay, you make a fair point. However... Drake is still better than Hawkins IMO. Hawkins hits harder, but drake is beefier and has a significantly better captain effect. Granted, Stick Hawkins in a Drake burst team and things explode, but still."
OnePieceTC,3d1uc0,Martiallawe,5,Mon Jul 13 10:45:46 2015 UTC,"If you don't have a ton of units, don't look at this Sugo as ""I need to get G3 or Rayleigh"" or you might be disappointed. Instead hope for a good overall batch of pulls - Marco, Law, Kidd, Killer and other units you may or may not have like Towel Nami, Vista are all worth pulling for at this stage of the game. Unless you are prepared to spend (potentially large) amounts of money, it will likely be pretty disappointing if you are only looking for a 6 *.    That said, I would pull. This is a good Sugofest and it will likely be a rate-up for all of the supernovas, so if you are eyeing any of them, I would definitely recommend it. Possibility of a 6 * is just a bonus."

OnePieceTC,3d1uc0,raistlyn,3,Sun Jul 12 21:17:30 2015 UTC,"How new is fairly new? If your account isn't very far along you might be better off rerolling for Rayleigh + another decent rare recruit unit. I'd spend the gems on your account first if you do decide to reroll, might not need to.  If your account is around plvl 121 though, then I'd save all the gems for farming Mihawk whenever he decides to return."
OnePieceTC,3d1uc0,gargoss,2,Mon Jul 13 00:03:33 2015 UTC,"If as you say, are fairly new, this (Sugofest) is the ideal time to spend your hard-earned rainbow gems, as even if you don't get Whitebeard or Rayleigh, the odds of getting a good to great pull are the highest at this time. If you have most of the previously released units and are after one or two other than the exclusives, then unless it's a DEX unit (which has an even higher chance if it's part of Sugofest), you may want to do a few pulls for the heck of it and hang onto some gems for use in this fortnight's other events."
OnePieceTC,3d1uc0,tadabola,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:17:04 2015 UTC,"Depends on your characters. I could skip since I already have 3 of the characters in this sugo (law, basil hawkings and killer - all wich I got unevolved and worked my way to evolve them).   If you don't have any supernova, its 10 good characters to have, and if you are new you could even get something good completely different.  I would go for it."

OnePieceTC,3d20kp,IBringTheHype,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:53:27 2015 UTC,who is your captain and who you're using as a friend captain ? what is your team?
OnePieceTC,3d20kp,tadabola,1 point,Sun Jul 12 22:01:24 2015 UTC,"Currently using max level Bazooka Luffy, Level 40 Pound Phoenix Zoro, Level 35 Iron Mace Alvida, Gold Pound Usopp level 1, and using Basil Hawkins at the moment just because I figured it would help against those two, but still ended up losing."
OnePieceTC,3d20kp,tadabola,3,Sun Jul 12 22:08:05 2015 UTC,"bazooka luffy only give 1.5 atk boost and only to STR units. Evolve him, and kick everyone who is not STR unit out of your party (minus usopp).   evolve your zoro as well and start making a dex team.   anyway, you need to start focus on your units, I think one turtle time might be enough for you to at least evolve 2 or 3 characters. You should spend the week fighting for evolvers and trying to get paulie and khalifa while they're around"
OnePieceTC,3d20kp,Martiallawe,1 point,Sun Jul 12 22:24:50 2015 UTC,"Is there a way you could post a picture your box? From what you have said though, I would try and evolve Bazooka Luffy by farming a red pirate penguin from the special island or Loguetown and a dragon. I would also evolve Alvida and try and farm an Arlong from Arlong Park to round out a semi-decent force team."
OnePieceTC,3d20kp,Lucifer51,1 point,Sun Jul 12 22:20:39 2015 UTC,"What type of team do you run, and levels?"
OnePieceTC,3d20kp,bitereality,1 point,Sun Jul 12 22:02:36 2015 UTC,post a pic of your box is really the best way people can help you like this http://imgur.com/a/WnKSM
OnePieceTC,3d20kp,Heval1,1 point,Sun Jul 12 22:33:57 2015 UTC,"IMO there is no need to hurry with the story mode. Just make sure you get a decent amount of xp out of your stamina. Try running the easier event isles for xp and characters. Use the turtle times and level/evolve your characters. Try to get some proper teams build around captain abilities so you get the most out of them. If you lack characters you can try to farm characters from islands you already finished. You should also pull next sugo if you are in need of some proper characters.  In short, take your time and enjoy the game ;)"
OnePieceTC,3d20kp,BankaiKenpachi,1 point,Mon Jul 13 01:46:47 2015 UTC,"It's not about getting past chapter 6 of Lougetown; it's about leveling up your most useful units. Even if you get past chapter 6, most likely you will struggle later on again. Level up Arlong (evolve him first if you haven't), Zoro, and any kinds of slashers you have at the moment. Also, don't play the same stage over and over if you can't beat it, it's waste of stam. Play through what you can manage, gain exp and level up characters, that's how you do it."
OnePieceTC,3d2ejj,MasterUchiha23,4,Sun Jul 12 23:49:54 2015 UTC,"Mihawk will come multiply times in the future, I wanna farm him too but Im gonna be spending my gems on this sugo, this one of the best sugos we'll get for awhile, but it really comes down to your box what your lacking and what you have, I have only 3 supernovas so this sugo could be good for me, Once raidbosses start re-appearing often we'll get mihawk quite often, but as they add more charters to rare recruit its gonna be harder to get these character Imo. But majority of it depends on your box."
OnePieceTC,3d2ejj,Adrales,1 point,Mon Jul 13 00:00:31 2015 UTC,Really good point. I guess i'll just use these 20 gems for sugofest and pray for rayleigh or kid. Thank you :D

OnePieceTC,3d2ejj,Altair1124,1 point,Mon Jul 13 06:31:15 2015 UTC,"4 pulls is really abysmal and your odds of pulling anything good are really low, but like the other guy said your odds are best now to get anything and I've seen some whitebeard pulls live on streams with 10 gems.  Good luck!"
OnePieceTC,3d2ejj,GarpTheMarineHero,1 point,Mon Jul 13 01:59:30 2015 UTC,I got WB on my 4th pull last sugo ;)
OnePieceTC,3d2ejj,Adrales,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:48:21 2015 UTC,"you have no weight behind your ""multiple times"" argument. jap got mihawk 3 or 4 times before rayleigh was announced. how many did we get? it's all speculation."
OnePieceTC,3d2ejj,GarpTheMarineHero,1 point,Mon Jul 13 00:19:51 2015 UTC,"Well, its almost certain after we've had a decent amount of raidbosses we will start having, weekly raidbosses like JPN, its bound to happen and the raidbosses that will repeat the most should be Mihawk since he was the first raiboss (and one of the easiest). On top of that we don't even know when he'll be back could still be awhile till he comes back."
OnePieceTC,3d2ejj,Adrales,1 point,Mon Jul 13 00:22:40 2015 UTC,will be on 07-13-2018 with the expansion of max box slots to 250.

OnePieceTC,3d2ejj,its_0nly_smellz,1 point,Mon Jul 13 06:30:16 2015 UTC,"I feel like the real question, if that's the case, would be sugofest pulls or box expansion?  If they increase it even to 300, isn't that 20 gems?"
OnePieceTC,3d2ejj,BankaiKenpachi,2,Mon Jul 13 12:19:26 2015 UTC,save for mihawk. A maxed mihawk is more useful than anything you can pull this sugo.
OnePieceTC,3d1iiu,Wokkrom,0,Sun Jul 12 19:25:59 2015 UTC,"Interesting to compare with Orange town. Orange town at 2x almost has 100% drop rate if you encounter them. But they show up like 50% time.   If Kalifa 5 has 50% drop rate, then it is better. Since the XP is much more."
OnePieceTC,3d1iiu,hkreeves,0,Sun Jul 12 22:09:51 2015 UTC,Do we get gems for clearing the 5 stam stage too?  I once thought it was only the 30 stamina stage where we get the gem.  Thanks for letting me know!
OnePieceTC,3d1iiu,kof201,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:36:07 2015 UTC,You get a gem from clearing all difficulties. The gem will appear on whichever is the last one you clear.
OnePieceTC,3d1iiu,AlecarMagna,1 point,Mon Jul 13 01:46:08 2015 UTC,"Ohh... so let say, I only cleared the 5, 10 and 15 stam Khalifa, I will not get any gem because I didn't clear the 30 gem, correct?"
OnePieceTC,3d1iiu,kof201,1 point,Mon Jul 13 01:53:16 2015 UTC,Right. If you start in the other direction (30-15-10-5) you will get the gem when you beat 5 stam.
OnePieceTC,3d0of2,vakema123,4,Sun Jul 12 15:06:02 2015 UTC,No. When an enemy has a turn delay on them all of your units will gain 1.2x attack
OnePieceTC,3d0of2,ShwimmingAway,3,Sun Jul 12 15:12:24 2015 UTC,Is that buff just activated when the special is used? That sounds a little odd either way.
OnePieceTC,3d0of2,ShwimmingAway,4,Sun Jul 12 15:13:32 2015 UTC,Yea. So if you use the special but there is no turn delay on then you won't get that buff
OnePieceTC,3d0of2,Fuzzy_MI,1 point,Sun Jul 12 15:42:48 2015 UTC,"what if you use her special and then usopp and then say boa, followed by mr3.  Does the bonus stack?"
OnePieceTC,3d0of2,ShwimmingAway,1 point,Mon Jul 13 09:24:54 2015 UTC,"Well the characters would have to have a turn delay on them already so it would always have to be Usopp first. But that wouldn't work since boosts don't stack, nor do delays. You can use v2 coby and impact Usopp on the same turn but you wouldn't be able to use Impact usopp and Young shanks on the same then and have double boosts"
OnePieceTC,3d0of2,Vedie,2,Mon Jul 13 11:06:01 2015 UTC,"I think its like: you use GP usop and afterwards her skill -> 1,2x to delayed enemies. If u aint able to delay an enemy due a debuff protector you wont get the buff. It's similar to Sadi-chan 1,3xatk buff on def broken enemies. Not sure if im correct, bcus i dont own her, so i did not test it."
OnePieceTC,3d0of2,SilviMasters,3,Sun Jul 12 15:14:40 2015 UTC,She does look incredible... dem gams!
OnePieceTC,3d0of2,tadabola,3,Sun Jul 12 15:15:00 2015 UTC,"I think her atk is not eve 1k ...   just looked - its 993 at max.   edit: on the blog they put squardo stats on her!!!! she doesn't have negative recovery as well. in fact, her recovery is quite high - a trait between the women in this game pehaps  http://onepiece-treasurecruise.com/c-645/"
OnePieceTC,3d1b5p,KaitoGL,2,Sun Jul 12 18:26:00 2015 UTC,"you can open 5 chests per week. Possible reward depends on the chest type (wooden < silver < gold). The better the chest the higher the chance for better rewards. AFAIK someone on this subreddit made a thread where chest loot data has been gathered, might want to search for it."
OnePieceTC,3d1b5p,Heval1,1 point,Sun Jul 12 18:32:41 2015 UTC,what are the rewards ? :) i think i got some key. but it was after so many tries
OnePieceTC,3d1b5p,Heval1,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:23:41 2015 UTC,"You can get keys to do the pig island, Cola (x5), Beli, FP. Dunno if that's all and how exactly the % chances for the different chest types are."
OnePieceTC,3d21tu,drawpthebase,3,Sun Jul 12 22:03:37 2015 UTC,"Because they are not the same character. They are just no name mobs without an identity, sadly. All mobs that are on the same evolution path are different characters. However skills are the same."
OnePieceTC,3d21tu,hkreeves,3,Sun Jul 12 22:23:16 2015 UTC,they won't give you the same character exp bonus anymore but you can still level up his special with the red marines
OnePieceTC,3d21tu,TheRob1001,1 point,Sun Jul 12 22:25:07 2015 UTC,So only red marines? And unevolved ones work?

OnePieceTC,3d30hs,MyAceTeam,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:00:26 2015 UTC,"I've got 58 right now and I'll be pulling 10-11 times, saving the rest for box space, refills, etc.  I'll stop at 10 if I'm satisfied with what I get and I'll pull an 11th if I'm doing exceedingly well/terrible.  My main goal is Whitebeard, but I also need all 10 Supernovas, so a lot of consolation prizes.  Rayleigh would also be acceptable (but I highly doubt I'll pull him)."

I really REALLY want Rayleigh (or you know...Whitebeard...), but it's not reasonable for me to expect them. As for attainable goals, I'll be trying to get Law and Apoo. Since it's both a DEX up and Supernova rate up, this is my best chance to get them. I might buy some gems to help me do that since this will be the best time to get them for the rest of the game since the pool is still lower in addition to those rate ups."

OnePieceTC,3czegv,feelthepfunk,1 point,Sun Jul 12 04:46:10 2015 UTC,And which one is better? I understand I think people like both of them but which is better to get first or is it situational
OnePieceTC,3czegv,drawpthebase,4,Sun Jul 12 04:59:25 2015 UTC,"If you dont have a vista and you arent willing to farm 2 crocs id say go for croc in his slasher form. That is because he will be a beast free unit and fit in any slasher team as a heavy int hitter. But if you dont really need an int slasher, croc in his impact form is good for his special and fitting in nicely along with kid or in the future akoji teams. Not to mention in his impact form his cost is 20 so he can also go good with Sengoku teams and buggy ship. But id reccomend farming for 2 crocs if at all possible will make it easier."
OnePieceTC,3czegv,S3xybaus,1 point,Sun Jul 12 08:33:22 2015 UTC,"I will farm two, I have a lvl 80 vista too so I'll get the non slasher one first I guess. Thanks for your Advice man"
OnePieceTC,3czegv,drawpthebase,1 point,Sun Jul 12 08:38:49 2015 UTC,Yeah dont worry about it too much. His evolution wont be available until the next batch with the shibukai and boa come out. Croc slasher is a beast and so is his impact so farming to is definetly worth it.

OnePieceTC,3cyd82,hunterdaniel1,1 point,Sun Jul 12 16:58:49 2015 UTC,the problem is that most people don't get help in megathreads. because people who know the answers don't want to regulary check the help team build thread scroll through 1000 posts and then find someone that needs help. it's just too much of a hazzle. if they post it on the frontpage they get help immidietly because others actually see it. that's just how it works.

I really hope you're right and they give more characters the Smoker treatment... possibly with rad as hell motorcycles! :P"
OnePieceTC,3d02ra,SilviMasters,3,Sun Jul 12 13:03:15 2015 UTC,well smoker got a new evolution later in the game so mayebe...
OnePieceTC,3d02ra,bitereality,4,Sun Jul 12 10:42:52 2015 UTC,"I personally think that there is a possibility that the original character will be given further evolution path, i.e. g2 Luffy 5 stars unit may be evolved into timeskipped Luffy 6 stars unit.  A while back there is a discussion about a possibility of a 7 star units in the future because in the rarity box in the unit details there is a space for 7 stars. Some people argue such introduction will be unlikely considering that the current 6 stars units are already OP and introduction of 7 stars would ruin the power balance of the game which has been carefully kept so far. Also, such introduction will make the older character obsollete.  So IMO the only way to maintain balance while introducing 7 stars units, if there ever will be one, is giving the older unit further evolution. But this will probably be too much work for Bandai and with little monetary benefits for them so this will be very unlikely. But it is always fun to speculate and thinking wishfully :)  Sorry for the lengthy response."

OnePieceTC,3d0fqf,rubbertrain12,1 point,Sun Jul 12 13:37:12 2015 UTC,You're right about them being stupid if they dont but even if they dont increase it now everyone will still increase box space if they release it later so I don't see it as potential income just straight up income but more people would be more encouraged to expand during sugo
OnePieceTC,3d0fqf,marqt,3,Sun Jul 12 13:43:07 2015 UTC,"Agree that people will increase their box no matter when it would be introduced. But I would suppose that older player is at their limit now in terms of box space. Without extra space people can only do so many pull before their box is full and stop spending more gem. I understand that there will still be players, especially newer players, spending their gems and buying gems. But older players with box space problem will not be able to spend as many as they want. Bandai will still profit without doubt but there will be lost of opportunity. Maybe it is calculated on their part and maybe there is a good reason business wise in postponing the box expansion. But I am hoping it is coming before Sugo or I won't be able to pull as many as I want. And hopefully in those few pulls I got Rayleigh, haha.. Anyway, just a rant from a man in desperate in of box space.. Wish you all the best for the coming Sugo!"

OnePieceTC,3czjyn,MagicIsBull,3,Sun Jul 12 05:16:51 2015 UTC,"Im not a SW shanks expert but this is what I do  1) IF your character levels are decent you can easily clear most fortnights and story, but some harder levels and/or Raid bosses could require garp to tank hits. I prefer 2 Shanks though, the amount of PSY orbs is insane.  2) No, I don't save the orbs, but I try to not use them if possible (Just me) but If I have to I don't hesitate, and if I know im gonna take a hit and need to heal up, I run broggy in my team to get RCV orbs.  3)( This is all my opinion) I think shank teams are really good, but he isn't the best 6* boss, I think he's only above Boa/Marco mostly cause of the orbs, but he's defiantly above raid bosses imo.  4) Yea like you said the PSY orbs make its a breeze, only problem might be maintain your HP but even that isn't a big issue, I enjoy using SW shanks ( Just cause he's one of my favourite characters) It all really comes down to preference."

Sometimes on the stage before Khalifa you'll fight Paulie (it happens completely randomly) and he drops 100% of the time you beat him.   They can both be dropped on any stamina difficulty, I got them both on 5 I think, one MIGHT have been 10 stamina but I don't think..."

There is no way that I know to get your bonus a day earlier, if there is one I would like to know as well.  But, look at it on the bright side.

OnePieceTC,3cy7n0,koryuken,1 point,Sat Jul 11 21:26:25 2015 UTC,"yeah but you have to be careful about cd if you using tsuru, she'll only get you through 1 hit from zeph like usopp and alvida which means you'll need low cd specials. Chopper gets you through 3 so cd wont be an issue"
OnePieceTC,3cy7n0,bitereality,1 point,Sat Jul 11 21:32:36 2015 UTC,"Idk about Tsuru because you can use her special only once in 12 turns (maxed case) so after 3 turns you have to use Alvida's special and then after 3 turns again use gp usopp's special. that saves up for: 3+3+3+3 (gp usopp delay)= 12 turns so yeah you can use Tsuru here because after his attack your 100% health will go down -7,2k you have 3 rounds to heal it up. if your Tsuru can heal you again in like 12-15 turns i guess you can make it. Not sure."
OnePieceTC,3cy7n0,InfernalJayed,1 point,Sun Jul 12 10:19:56 2015 UTC,very interesting take on it. Just have to be careful not to use the other meats on accident

OnePieceTC,3d1iu8,fwirth,2,Mon Jul 13 05:24:09 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure if this team will be able to do it without geming unless your levels get a lot higher. Based on the wiki post about Zephyr, this team is most similar to the garp burst team, but this lacks two of the burst units which makes your burst significantly lower."
OnePieceTC,3d1iu8,bitereality,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:01:06 2015 UTC,"for this team garp then shanks then urogue, your goal is to get your hp as close to 48k health as possible so with 1 or 2 meat orbs in the 6 turns you'll have you can gain the last few health you'll need to be able to tank 3rd hit from zeph. If you can tank that 3rd hit + max merry you'll be able to defeat zeph without gem. You'll need matching orb on urogue for your coby burst though, so u can use urogue special with it. goddluck"

OnePieceTC,3cym7b,kaosctrl510,3,Sat Jul 11 23:30:58 2015 UTC,"IMO unless you're gunning to min-max all content there's really no need to gem and purely aim for the specials. He will most likely return before the patch where SW Ace releases and he's really the ""must have"" when it comes to shooter teams.  Like others have suggested I'd say saving for mihawk return would be more profitable mainly because zephyr active doesn't have the same immediate impact on you game."
OnePieceTC,3cym7b,itspabo,2,Sun Jul 12 07:39:52 2015 UTC,"No, I don't think its really that worth atm, plus mihawk might be around the corner wanna save for him."
OnePieceTC,3cym7b,Adrales,2,Sat Jul 11 23:40:21 2015 UTC,"Bosses are always a pretty good way to get PLVL and turtles, so it depends on how many gems you have I guess. You are right that with our shooter unit pool, there isn't much reason to farm him other than to just have something to farm.  I will be farming him just because I want all the bosses max."
OnePieceTC,3cym7b,raistlyn,2,Sun Jul 12 01:13:40 2015 UTC,"^ This.  As I'm still hoping to get to get 120 stamina to farm Doffy efficiently maxing Zephyr seems to be one of the less lavish ways doing that.  I even think about maxing Ivankov, depending on how many blue turtles Lucci's isle will give me. Or should I prefer farming lucci's isle over and over to max Kaku? As rare as Paulie is to me sigh I'm talking about way more gems I would need for the same turtle amount than by farming ivankov. Maybe it depends if I get Capone this sugo or not. But I think I only do one or two pulls trying to get Apo - the only dex unit I'll need. Oops, got off the track. But that usually happens and shows that answering something that first seems like an easy decision depends on many many things and I didn't even mention to think about if you're lacking int units or not.  edit: If you can farm him with double marco teams it just seems so compelling not to do so."
OnePieceTC,3cym7b,yorunomegami,1 point,Sun Jul 12 06:49:32 2015 UTC,"Kaku is still a good sub to max, but if Lucci isle is anything like Khalifa has been for me, it's not a good source of turtles. We'll see I suppose. Ivankov is supposedly very easy and low health so I will be farming him as well."

But, if you are lacking an int gacha units, then double zeph captain with broggy coby tsuru and marine sergant puprle, burst more damage in the first turn than a double nami broggy coby robin buggy.

You have a good box though for being f2p.  EDIT: You can honestly do 100 gems for pulling during sugo if you wanted and use whatever you need for box expansion and you'll be set for a while, but up to you.  I'd at least shoot for 50 gems for pulling though."
OnePieceTC,3cz3iu,Heval1,1 point,Sun Jul 12 05:02:59 2015 UTC,"wow thats a lot of gems, if i had your box, and those gems, i'd wait. Yes it'll be hard to do and maybe not the right idea but heres my thinking. Seems in Japan, after the supernova part2 with rayleigh suog, the next sugo had the supernovas + whitbeard pirates including ray and wb. This means besides kidd law urogue killer apuu etc, marco jozu killer izo vista etc will have their rate ups. Since you have none of them at the moment, it'd mean whoever you pull will be a plus. If you pull now from this limited pool you'll still need to pull next and then you might pull same units. Bur thats if global follows sugo release like japan. And its still rng, but i'd hope to think with close to 40 pulls you should be able to get most of the gacha units if not all. Just to add and maybe help, our next raidboss zeph i feel isnt a do or die for maxing his special right now since shooter teams in my opinion still fall behind slasher, especially with mihawk ship coming out, so 1 should be enough for now. And your units should be able to take on the next couple fortnights with levels, well your int team will need 2 more units, zephy being 1. All i'm trying to say is you should be able to survive the upcoming content till next sugo, At least thats what i'm banking on as well, ive got 80 gems and dont plan to pull well except for that 1 yolo pull anyway. But as i said, i am banking on next sugo having the wb pirates and supernovas.  Note if you bought those gems, might have been better to have rerolled a fresh account with ray and bought them there. Advantages would be it'd be worth since you dont have a g3 in this present account. Disadvantage would be you'd lose mchopper, mihawk, smoker hina, garp, coby and helmeppo. But ray which i feel brings the best of wb and g3 with slighlly less damage and more forgiving playstyle might be worth having to wait for those isles to return, Plus your large pool of gems would have helped offset the loss, by next month though. it would mean slow progress till the next sugo. The long con. Wow thats a lot, anyway my oopinion in the end up to you goodluck"

As long as you dont go over the HP restriction then those are the best subs. I dont think there are any other HP reduction units than the ones you mentioned apart from Mihawk and Whitebeard.  Laboon/vivi teams can clear Mihawk, Monster Chopper, Garp and Zephyr. Best way to find out why a laboon/vivi team isnt suitable for the rest is to just watch a video of that boss being cleared on youtube. Main reasons are bosses will lock your captains which stops your captain ability from working or there might be more than 1 unit attacking you at the same time which stops Laboons ability from working."

OnePieceTC,3cw9sj,ynggkim,17,Sat Jul 11 08:36:58 2015 UTC,"Can't tell you that much about G3 as I barely use them, but I can tell you about slashers.  Slashers are strong mainly because of three factors - Doflamingo, Mihawk, and the Coffin Boat. They also obviously have high stat members that can work as subs. (i.e. Vista, Crocodile, SW Shanks, etc.) I'd say slashers are still a little better than strikers.  That being said, striker teams got plenty of toys to work with- and the recent addition of Aokiji really gave it a big boost. The fact that Aokiji can do both an Orb Lock + Attack Boost is pretty significant. Enel is also a high stat Striker member- but he is geared more towards Speed teams, rather than Striker teams. Kaku and Urogue also deserve honorable mentions- the former for being an orb booster and the latter as an attack buffer.  In my personal opinion, the factor that hurts Striker teams compared to slasher teams is the lack of a boat + lack of good orb manipulation. How good the coffin boat is pretty much self-explanatory. 1.5x to both Attack and HP is insane. And Doflamingo's special is good enough to the point where he will find a spot in teams without a DEX or Slasher attack boosting captain. The orb switch twice + 2X Boost is just that strong. Strikers have a harder time running a multi-colored team because of a lack of such a character.  Kidd is still a top tier captain that can definitely clear all fortnights without restrictions (i.e. DEX only)- and a lot of the raidbosses.  Edit: I got Kaku and Urogue mixed up. Thanks /u/Zee_n1"

OnePieceTC,3cw9sj,koryuken,1 point,Sat Jul 11 09:43:10 2015 UTC,"Nice analysis. I don't think that any type will ever be up to the snuff of slashers until they do two things: 1) have their own boat with Damage & HP boost. 2) have captains that do 30% damage for their special. Think about it, dual Mihawk will scale infinitely to any raid boss. The harder (i.e. more HP/dmg turn/etc) the bosses become, the more amazing the 50% damage in a single turn becomes. I even think at some point/future difficulty dual Mihawk + Boat + Doffy might outclass Rayleigh/WB/Log Luffy. Percent damage will never become obsolete.   Edit: The only possible weakness I see is that with Dual Mihawk/Doffy, is that half of your team is Dex. However that is not a huge deal, since the other three units can be of any color."
OnePieceTC,3cw9sj,Vedie,4,Sun Jul 12 04:54:25 2015 UTC,"Well i only play the Japan version and have a Striker Team with Kidd as Lead sometimes. I work on getting better Striker atm. We have very strong Striker/Impact chars in the japan version. F.ex. Raid Boss Enel with over 1400atk (level 99) and Aokiji with over 1400atk as well. Also the new char ""Squardo"" (Yellow Striker) has above 1400 and a great Orb boosting skill of 1,75x for 1 Round. You can use some good combinations like Hawkins and Sadi-Chan for the def break -> Sadi-Chan skill = 3 Round 1,3xatk. In my opinion Striker are one of the strongest characters in the game. But it takes a while to get some great Character. Most of them are Rare Recruits or Raid bosses, which means that u need a good team to beat the Raid Bosses. Striker will be awesome as soon as u get your Raid Bosses to low CD (Aokiji Ability etc.). My Team: Kidd (Lead) Enel (Blue) Squardo (Yellow) or Sadi-Chan (Purple) Alvida (Red) Hawkins (Purple) Planing to get Aokiji and with some luck Urogue.  I switch my chars depending how i want to use them. I hope i could help u a bit! :D"

OnePieceTC,3cw9sj,Vedie,1 point,Sat Jul 11 09:29:52 2015 UTC,"HMMMMMM can I ask how valuable is hawkins sadi combo? I would assumes bosses with the debuff shield is not effected by hawkins correct?  I do have hawkins, urogue, killer and alvida on my team which in theory sounds pretty good but from the post above still doesn't stack up as good as a slasher team due to not having a beast boat.  So main question is, is hawkins sadi pretty much a must have in your opinion for strikers to excel or you think orb boost+lock works better( If you have tried) ?"
OnePieceTC,3cw9sj,day2k,3,Sat Jul 11 09:51:40 2015 UTC,"Well it wont work without the def break. But its not a must have skill combo, but since both are Striker its nice to be used together. For strong event island bosses its nice to have 1.3xatt for 3 Rounds. Well the effect of the coffin boat ist ""just"" 1,5xHp more compared to Merry. That's not a huge advantage. But i think that striker have many characters with huge att and hp which reduces the advantage a bit. But creating a good slasher team is for f2p easier to fund/get. Impact units are mostly rare recruit. And there are more Mihawk Friends than Kidd/Aokiji's imo."

OnePieceTC,3cw9sj,raistlyn,1 point,Sat Jul 11 10:05:13 2015 UTC,"I think the extra 1.5x HP is what actually gives slasher the advantage to beat Enel though, since Enel attacks every turn"
OnePieceTC,3cw9sj,SWShanks,1 point,Sat Jul 11 16:47:34 2015 UTC,"That's true, but striker can use Alvida or Smoker to survive some runs aswell. I think there is only Mr.1's special for reduced income damage, not sure tho."
OnePieceTC,3cw9sj,raistlyn,2,Sat Jul 11 17:06:49 2015 UTC,"G3 and Slasher are on par with WB/Log/Ray (soon to be Ace), especially Slasher. Kidd teams are in a pretty good place though, not as good as G3/Slasher, but definitely better than boa/shanks/marco, and might even be able to clear more bosses than Sengoku, not entirely sure off the top of my head. They are pretty great for fortnight/story though."
OnePieceTC,3cw9sj,koryuken,3,Sat Jul 11 08:58:07 2015 UTC,Kidd teams arent close to being better than boa/shanks/marco. Boa/shanks/marco have higher damage multipliers as well as secondary captain abilities.
OnePieceTC,3cw9sj,kys916,0,Sat Jul 11 16:18:31 2015 UTC,"doesn't matter, they have type restrictions which keep them from doing most of the content. Kidd teams can clear more bosses and fortnights.  Against the right types? yeah boa/shanks/marco will out damage Kidd teams."
OnePieceTC,3cw9sj,basedchristos,0,Sat Jul 11 20:51:50 2015 UTC,wow I did not realize that boa/marco with their 6 star versions would still lose to a Kidd team. Thx for the input.
OnePieceTC,3cw9sj,day2k,2,Sat Jul 11 09:41:47 2015 UTC,"He means against certain bosses. Basically Boa/Marco are better against Purple or Red, but worse for everything else. Strikers are good against anything, since there is no type restriction for your team."
OnePieceTC,3cx7rj,caligari1,3,Sat Jul 11 16:03:39 2015 UTC,I also have around 30 and I'm going to save my gems. I figure box space expansion and Mihawk will come pretty soon and I'd rather max a Mihawk and my box size than possiblly pull a couple good units from sugo.
OnePieceTC,3cx7rj,Marrgasm,3,Sat Jul 11 16:39:41 2015 UTC,"yea, I think spending 30-40 gems to max out Mihawk's special is the best bang for your gems. It'll take you really far along in the game  You may want some gatcha slashers (Vista, Shanks), but I dont think they're a big deal. Arlong/Mr 3/Helmeppo are super useful, and you can get Lucci/Brook/Ryuma soon to cover the other colors.  Gemming for cola is not really worth it if you need to consider it. Snails are coming soon, and you basically get free colas everyday"

In my Main JP Acc they come up just every once in a while, mostly after I finish any adventure. On my second JP Acc, which really only collects daily gems, they come up just when I login, and then there's always atleast 4 or 5 of them in a row. I use one, go to my character box, then go back to the adventure screen and there is a new one. I can't reproduce that on my main Acc. So, your guess is as good as mine ;)"

After saying all that, i doubt i'll be able to resist pulling. The draw of ray is too strong, specially since i dont have g3. Its a dex rate up so looking forward to disappointments galore. goodluck"
OnePieceTC,3cx7rj,KSmoria,1 point,Sat Jul 11 17:46:15 2015 UTC,"How much stamina do you have?  That is a good measure of how valuable refills are to you.  If you have 80+ and can farm a 40 stam raid boss twice per refill, Mihawk would be worth some gems.  You seem to already have a ton of great RR-only units, but there are a couple DEX units you would benefit from.  I would recommend pulling 1-3 times and save the rest for raid bosses and turtle times."
OnePieceTC,3cx7rj,wagner_46,1 point,Sat Jul 11 22:09:38 2015 UTC,"I'm f2p and I will skip this sugo. I don't have any supernovas and I don't really find them essential (I have G3, Vista and Ace so far). WB and Rayleigh are nice, but the chances are I won't pull them. I'd say if you need any of the supernovas (especially the DEX ones), do some pulls, else keep your gems for the next sugo."
OnePieceTC,3cx7rj,Matainer,1 point,Sat Jul 11 23:20:28 2015 UTC,"imma bump this, since mihawks coming on 16. At 70 Stamina max, do you think geming after 1x30 and 1x40 (34 runs + level ups) is better than 2x 40 + wait, which would result in 29 runs + level ups?"
OnePieceTC,3cyc9r,Magic-Man2,1 point,Sat Jul 11 21:59:52 2015 UTC,"at 100% health you have 2.75x attack boost, as your health decreases so does the multiplier, the lowest being 2x at 1hp. He also increases yellow orb appearances"
OnePieceTC,3cyc9r,suganips,1 point,Sat Jul 11 22:07:38 2015 UTC,"The blog is wrong if that's the reason you're asking, it's a 2.75x boost to PSY attack only at full health. The boost goes down depending on your health as /u/suganips said. He also increases the appearance of PSY orbs, which you can rely on for the most part, but still not a full replacement for Garp/Mr 2 subs."
OnePieceTC,3cyc9r,raistlyn,1 point,Sun Jul 12 01:15:48 2015 UTC,"With double SW Shanks I typically get at least 3 matching orbs per round and all 6 isn't that uncommon. If you look at the damage over multiple rounds, you would be best fit with ignoring orb manipulation on double SW Shanks unless you are facing a boss with orb manipulation."
OnePieceTC,3cyc9r,MagicIsBull,1 point,Sun Jul 12 05:04:46 2015 UTC,"the problem with that is in scenarios where it would actually matter (bosses like Zephyr) not having full orbs on a turn when you active Impact/Coby is a loss of potentially millions of damage. SW Shanks is still essentially a burst captain, you don't usually have the luxury to fight for multiple turns.  Plus, Garp is one of the best PSY subs you can have anyway, so you would only really gain stats or another ability from replacing Mr 2."
OnePieceTC,3cyc9r,raistlyn,1 point,Sun Jul 12 05:41:21 2015 UTC,"Personally due to lacking Marco, I used Garp to maintain the 2.75 boost after the second hit from Zephyr, assuming I had enough food orbs preserved for the first hit, and save Usopp and Coby for the most consistent psy orbs since I had plenty of chances."
OnePieceTC,3cyc9r,MagicIsBull,1 point,Sun Jul 12 06:04:06 2015 UTC,"yeah, it kinda works, just not reliable enough for me I guess. I only had one run against Zephyr where I got to hit him for ~3 mill cause I started the fight with full health and 5 orbs. Every other run it was 2-3 orbs and if they weren't on SW Shanks they were pretty worthless anyway."
OnePieceTC,3cyc9r,raistlyn,1 point,Sun Jul 12 07:57:51 2015 UTC,"I wonder, mathematically, what the PSY orb rate increase works out to be in terms of average damage output. SW Shanks teams could feasibly be outputting more damage on average than Rayleigh in spite of the type limitation thanks to this orb boost but I don't have the mathematical knowledge (or any idea what the chance increase is likely to amount to) to do any calculations."

OnePieceTC,3cyzb2,bitereality,1 point,Sun Jul 12 03:41:49 2015 UTC,"em, not sure a dex team of asura pauli khali izo and gp will have an easy time with 40 stamina mihawk even with max merry. Running the team through damage calculator with all lv 70 units and max merry, you deal 100k base damage and have health close to 40k. With the mihawk 4500 preemptive attack that means you can tank 3 hits. So 4 turns of damage plus another 3 from gp usopp special. For 2 of those turns, with the pualie khali izo special you are guaranteed matching ors, so double damage.   This translates to 5 turns dealing 100k and 2 turns dealing 200k damage. Thats 900k damage, mihawk is 1,180,000. 300k short. But you will be able to run the 30 stamina quite easily with this team, even without merry. Goodluck get 2nd opinion"

OnePieceTC,3cx5vf,bassplayerdoitdeeper,6,Sat Jul 11 15:46:10 2015 UTC,"You're in a decent position for the current event islands. Here's what I recommend:   If you don't play that much, don't bother trying to evolve Shanks, Ace and Kuro right now. While they have some decent stats and abilities, they are very expensive to evolve compared to others and will soak up all your turtles that you could be using to bolster other solid units (like Alvida for example). Do the Kalifa island right now since you have a decent enough STR team (I'd stick with G3 lead). If you get Kalifa and Paulie then you can level them and make a really solid DEX team with Zoro, Smoker (try to evolve him), Paulie, Kalifa and Zeff. This island also drops lots of Green fodder and turtles to help level these characters. You can use this team against the next event island which is Rob Lucci. Lucci and Kaku drop from here and are both fantastic characters. Lucci will completely outclass Tashigi and Kuro so don't level those two for the time being. At this point you'll have Paulie, Kaku, GP Usopp, Mr. 3 and Alvida (evolve her asap). These are all great units that be used in a variety of teams. You've also got some solid leads with G3, Zoro, Arlong and Zeff (though not a lot of Fighters to use with him). Unfortunately the next island is Franky who will require INT units which you are pretty short on, but you won't be missing out on all that much from him anyways. After that is Kraken which you should be able to manage decently with Ace (lousy unevolved stats but still 2x attack as captain), Lucci, Kaku, Sanji (try to evolve him) and one filler.   This should get you started and provide a gameplan for the next couple months. Might be worth your while to do some pulls during Sugofest next week. If you get manage to get a Rayleigh or Kidd it will do wonders for you. Try not to go overboard with your gems though. Spend some buying box space and save a few for a rainy day.  Hope this helps :)"
OnePieceTC,3cx5vf,feelthepfunk,3,Sat Jul 11 19:13:06 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much for the advice,  I will have likr 70 gems by the time sugofest fest rolls around, so I'll probably do a few pulls. As others have mentioned I'm going to try focusing on turtle times to help level up some of my units"
OnePieceTC,3cx5vf,Captainwings,2,Sat Jul 11 19:28:41 2015 UTC,"You've got G3, GP Usopp, and Arlong which is a good start. Arlong is a great slasher team captain for when you don't have Mihawk. For now, I'd use your G3 as a captain and go for a damage build. Level and evolve your Alvida as well, her second form has a great special for bosses (80% damage reduction to next attack received). You'll want to run Alvida and GP Usopp as your last two units in the crew, if you plan on doing a damage build. Also if you manage to get Fire Pearl you could use your Chopper to generate food orbs and have Pearl change them into Str orbs, for a Str team."

Another viable option is a slasher team, since u have some of all colors. Both will work fine for you.   You can focus on other kind of teams, when u get new characters later on.

Your base character and resulting character have special levels displayed and  so you can see if you will keep your special levels or if they will reset to one.  You have to already have special levels in your base character in order to check though. It wont explicitly tell you if they are the same special so you can't know whether it is worth leveling the special of the base character from lv.1 using this method. The better method is to check an online source for their names but this can be the decider if you are still unsure."

Your characters seem a bit underlevelled so try levelling them a bit first, especially the 3 QCK ones. Ideally you should also evolve Kuro/Killer but that might not be needed. In terms of tactics, try stalling until you've got most of your specials up for Wapol and also try hitting with your highest attack QCK characters last (in case you haven't already been doing it, to maximize damage output)"

Just make sure your garp friend has cd special less than 20 and unit level 50+ to be safe. and get your marco urogue to at least 30, 40+ would be a lot better. Goodluck"

OnePieceTC,3cw9s8,Enishigringo,3,Sat Jul 11 08:36:52 2015 UTC,"I don't read Japanese so this may not be 100% accurate. But, I think for this ranking, the grading criteria is cost & turn. As you may already know you need to try to minimise cost & finish the quest ASAP. I am pretty sure your friend cost is included in the calculation so your best choice to reduce cost while maintaining high damage output is v1 Ace or Sanji (the rooster version one) for friends instead of Boa/Enel, etc.  I managed to get around 740k using the team below, I managed to clear every stage in 1 turn and kill Surume in 2 turns, so it took me 8 turns in total. I got lucky because the mini Boss is the Master of Near Sea, he is Str unit so I can one shot him. Also, I got Blue orb for my 3 hardest hitters in Surume's first turn.  So here is my team:  Jinbei 4* (cost 15), Dog Sanji (Cost 11), Diablo Jambe Sanji (Cost 15), Banadile (Cost 10), Ms Valentine (Cost 15) and friend Ace (Cost 20). They are all Blue Fighter because I am using pre-evolved Jinbei as my captain.  Hope it helps, cheers.  Edit: fixing my grammar and sentences presses save too quick, apologies."

Therefore, let's set up priorities:  1)Mihawk (need around 50 gems considering you will have 80 stamina by then, if not 1 gem per run I guess)  2) Roll for sugo (Rayeleigh would definitely be a nice pull to clear story mode + event isles and Apoo would complete your Law-Apoo combo, however, if you are not considering to buy gems, I would do maximum 1-2 fun pulls, since Mihawk>Sugo  3) Expand character box  Priorities end up here, farming cola/exp using gems to refill is something you want to do when you are over 90-100 stamina in order to make the runs useful."

OnePieceTC,3cuuo4,Aoshi7Shanks,4,Fri Jul 10 23:52:10 2015 UTC,"I have used 3 different teams for the Merfolk isle:  Sw Ace x2/Zephyr/Izo/GP/SW Franky, all level 50-70. Probably my favorite to run, getting passed Hachi's blind is a little difficult if I don't get some orb luck (have almost no SPLV increases on this team)  G3 x2/GP/Vista/Log Sanji/AZoro - the fastest team, but obviously carries the risk of dying to missing a few perfects (especially if I get to Caimie too early and she has the wrong adds). On slower runs, Vista's special works wonders on the high defense add wave when they appear. Levels 50-70 except Vista is 90.  Azoro x2/Law/Apoo/Izo/Log Sanji/dont remember the last one, only ran this team a few times, it's too slow for my tastes but very safe. I ran it with a Law friend captain which cut down on safety but increased speed a couple times. Levels all around 50, mix of 4 and 5 star evos, my Dex and Qck units are pretty underleveled on both servers. AZoro leads the pack at 70 though. Also has a rough time getting through the blind on Hachi, just doesn't matter very much with almost 40k hp.  I only ran Kraken one time (Rayleigh books more important for me) Double 5 star Boa, Thatch, Killer, Enel, Jimbei, forget the last QCK unit I have here also. Thatch and boa are 70, everyone else around 50 (killer is max 4 star, enel is 4 star). The premptive that the rare spawn sea monster had almost caused me to lose due to knocking me below Boa's threshold for her captain ability. A little risky to run her without good/high subs imo."

I used Rob Lucci as my captain (I have no good quick captains sadly...) and a friend's maxed Raid Boss Enel and easily beat it.  Ace and Jozu can both easily defeat 30 stamina Kraken, even with a 2x captain like Rob Lucci.  The only hard part of doing Kraken runs is when the Dexterity Neptunian Squid shows up, because it resists all your units' attacks.  Miss Valentine can be pretty useful in the last stage against the Kraken on the second turn when he turns some orbs into meat because usually that's an easy 3-6 burst orbs."

OnePieceTC,3cuuo4,asscrasher,4,Sat Jul 11 03:11:28 2015 UTC,"Caimie's island is pretty interesting. I think it's the first island that imposes member cost limits? Regardless, didn't realize how much I rely on high cost units, even though it's just raid bosses and evolved 6* units.  Went through with double Rayleigh, Robin, TNami, Hawkins, and GP Usopp. I think this is the first 30 stam island for JP that I was consistently able to do, using more of a stalling approach for specials before reaching Hachi. Used Usopp for Hachi to stall for PSY orbs to convert with Nami in cases where Caimie didn't switch. Also used Hachi for his special twice during most runs where I could heal up before taking hits from Caimie's mobs.  Total, I think I got 7 Rayleigh books, can't remember how many runs I've done, though. Probably not going to do any more runs since I evolved my Rayleigh a couple days ago, and I'm probably going to put more focus into farming story mode drops like Crocodile/Kaku/Lucci for...an infinite amount of time until they drop."

OnePieceTC,3cuuo4,xAndrenx,1 point,Sat Jul 11 01:58:22 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I already regret evolving somewhat. Not being able to use 6* Rayleigh for Caimie means I have to go to my Jinbei Fighter team or my Kid Striker team, neither of which are at points I'm happy with.  But it is fun to have this sort of challenge. Color restrictions are annoying for my JP account since I only started working on it after I pulled Rayleigh two Sugos ago. Wish I'd done some runs of Lucci and Kaku when they were around a month or two ago to help with Kraken. Makes me wonder if we'll see some restrictions on raid bosses in the future."

If we get cost restrictions on bosses, then G3 will pretty much become mandatory barring other mechanics, but they can't keep increasing health and damage that bosses do because that's really poor balance. Duval had some interesting and difficult mechanics even though he had no health, so he might be a good benchmark for the rest of this wave."

OnePieceTC,3cuuo4,Chewy777,2,Fri Jul 10 23:47:31 2015 UTC,"I mainly played through 30 stam, but I also got one during 15 stam, so I'd guess it's just the drop rate increases as you increase difficulty, although drop rate on 30 stam is still pretty low."

OnePieceTC,3cwbsp,somelameguy,14,Sat Jul 11 09:11:57 2015 UTC,I agree with everyone in this thread but I think another factor is the fact that this game is based on the anime therefore no one will complain about strong characters like WB or Rayleigh being strong because it makes sense for it to be that way.
OnePieceTC,3cwbsp,patrykgam,3,Sat Jul 11 12:48:42 2015 UTC,I was exactly going to reply this! +1
OnePieceTC,3cwbsp,Strowolf,6,Sat Jul 11 14:11:23 2015 UTC,"I think it's because the game is still fun regardless. They also have a lot of ways to stop them being used. There are no Rayleigh's invited to Khalifa or the next fortnight event (Lucci, restricted to DEX teams). Later, cost restrictions also lock some of the god tier characters out of content."
OnePieceTC,3cwbsp,syngin-ps4,6,Sat Jul 11 09:28:11 2015 UTC,Because there hasnt been a boss i know about that cant be cleared by farmable units atleast in japan
OnePieceTC,3cwbsp,megamerman,6,Sat Jul 11 10:24:39 2015 UTC,"There's two major reasons for me personally.  The OP units in this game, as people have said... the really aren't OP They're very strong, but there isn't a unit in this game that you can throw into your team and clear literally anything regardless of your team/skill level, like there has been with Brave Frontier.   The second big reason for me is that this is an entirely PVE game. Because of this, it really doesn't matter if another player has the most broken thing ever, since it doesn't affect you at all, and if it makes the game unfun you can just not use it. Though again we don't really have a unit like that anyway."
OnePieceTC,3cwbsp,Blairrose28,4,Sat Jul 11 14:30:04 2015 UTC,Cuz Whitebeard is not even close to broken like Hadaron in BF...  With whitebeard u can fuck up real bad if u miscalculat or get locked... But Hadaron in BF requires ZERO yes I said ZERO EFFORT to clear everything + with only 1 auto button.
OnePieceTC,3cwbsp,PudgeJoe,5,Sat Jul 11 13:05:41 2015 UTC,"no one is complaining because whitebeard can't clear every content in this game easily. even with the content he can clear, it requires planning and 1 screw up will lead you dead.    Not to mention that the chances of pulling whitebeard is extremely low. There will only be a few of us that will have the luxury of using him.  Another reason is that you can clear the game content's without having any legends so having whitebeard, rayleigh or any 6* is not required."
OnePieceTC,3cwbsp,its_0nly_smellz,2,Sat Jul 11 09:27:21 2015 UTC,"Power creep is also pretty limited in this game. A lot of early units still hold places in the top stat values. Mihawk and Whitebeard are both in the top 5 units for HP and were introduced pretty early on, and Whitebeard was only recently beaten by Little Oarz Jr, which makes sense for a giant. Arlong and Monster Chopper are in the top 3 for attack. Miss Goldenweek (lol) has the 2nd highest RCV (lol), only losing to Hancock. Sogeking has the 5th highest RCV."
OnePieceTC,3cwbsp,xAndrenx,2,Sat Jul 11 17:34:57 2015 UTC,"I think the only character that we agree is OP is Arlong haha :D  In all seriousness, I think it's because we link the game to the anime. Whitebeard is labelled as the strongest man in the world for example, so it makes sense. Same for Rayleigh, the right-hand man of Gol D Roger. And then you have characters like Gaimon and Choo :p"
OnePieceTC,3cwbsp,Ninjafro,1 point,Sat Jul 11 19:29:24 2015 UTC,I think it's because it's so rare to get pulls like WB and Rayleigh that we don't mind too much. At least it's how I feel about it.
OnePieceTC,3cwbsp,JulianGiraffe,1 point,Sat Jul 11 09:19:14 2015 UTC,I'm not familiar with those other games.  Why did people complain about overpowered units in those games?
OnePieceTC,3cwbsp,eventual12345,3,Sat Jul 11 12:27:38 2015 UTC,"Juggler was so OP in PaD because it introduced easy x49 damage boost with subs and you could literally faceroll most bosses at the time, whereas most other leads at the time gave x25 with much more difficult activation conditions."
OnePieceTC,3cwbsp,chairmanedz,1 point,Sat Jul 11 14:32:04 2015 UTC,OPTC has been careful to introduce tougher requirements for most 6* units.  I guess not so much for Rayleigh.
OnePieceTC,3cwbsp,eventual12345,1 point,Sat Jul 11 16:58:14 2015 UTC,"In brave frontier, at the time, Tridon was the only unit who could provide the entire team with a shield. It was essentially half of a health bars worth of survivability. This would have been fine, if not for the fact that 50% damage mitigation was already a mechanic in the game, and the effects worked on the shield buff, making one unit able to essentially double your teams survivability, on top of lead skills and other buffs, which probably made it more potent."
OnePieceTC,3cwbsp,yorunomegami,1 point,Sat Jul 11 19:00:54 2015 UTC,"Whitebeard and g3 are basically units you could almost roll from the start. Now global gets rayleigh, but after him every u it has it's downside or can't be used in special isles, something bandai now evenstarts with ray and WB through cost condition isles.  So there is no power creep at all. And with enel being the first boss WB Teams couldn't clear it seems like bandai is aware of that and doesn't intend to change that. We just can hope that this stays the way it is."
OnePieceTC,3cwbsp,beardedheathen,0,Sat Jul 11 13:48:20 2015 UTC,There is definite power creep but it is controlled. If characters coming out now weren't more powerful than current characters there isn't much reason to upgrade.
OnePieceTC,3cwbsp,yorunomegami,1 point,Sat Jul 11 15:41:20 2015 UTC,"The stronger units often have a downside, or are just as powerful as existing units with other colors or a filling a niche.  If you look at the RR units you can get after upcoming sugo there are the 6* units, Jinbei (and there's already Zeff), maybe suicide Luffy and whitey bay (and there's nami) which you could call power creep. RR is only efficient if you are lucky enough to pull a 6* or you don't know what to do with your gems. Imo, you can pull once or twice, but normally there are better ways to spend the gems. All these units are not really necessary and on the other side there are so many powerful raidboss units to come.  Speaking about raidbosses, Doffy would be the overpowered unit of OPTC. Everyone talks about WB and Ray, but basically Doffy is in almost every team. Being that fersatile he could be called overpowered, but you need a powerful team to use Doffy efficiently.  The upgrading process you refer to seems to happen by using special conditions and side effects to isles. Starting with Kalifa there are color restrictions and later on type restrictions. In jap version they are now starting with cost restrictions. After I saw Enels raid I thought about how they are starting to give recovery more value than before.  In the long term they will come up with different raidboss sideeffects, e.g. reduced damage to a boss to hinder people bursting down bosses with double mihawk / g3 to foster diversity - just a guess, but we will see."
OnePieceTC,3cwbsp,beardedheathen,1 point,Sun Jul 12 07:09:38 2015 UTC,You just confirmed exactly what I said. Right now we have zeff but we'll be getting a stronger zeff with better stats. You have Arlong who was the strongest slasher lead and then Mihawk came along. You have doffy who is in almost every team. New units are out classing existing units. If you look at popular Japanese teams they are usually pretty full of characters that aren't in global.
OnePieceTC,3cwbsp,yorunomegami,1 point,Sun Jul 12 13:22:10 2015 UTC,"Then our definition of power creep differs. Mihawk as the first raid boss outclassed arlong, but mihawk basically came shortly after game release. As i said after rayleigh release there won't be many changes. And mihawk, and all other raidbosses are f2p units which you can max without buying gems.  Zeff will be outclassed, but by a Captain who has better stats. Power creep as in many other games would mean that zeff will be outclassed be a unit which gives atleast 3x to all units without condition. You shouldn't compare Japan vs global Teams with the units that differ but with units that didn't change. And most captins we have right now are still used. Of course some subs fit better because of specials or something else, but you still can clear the content with 'old units', e.g. law + apo outclass kalifa and zeff, but kalifa and zeff are good enough.   And many collectible games, not only f2p appstore games, but tcg and others have a real power creep problem. As long as there isn't a necessity for a 4x slasher captain with a special better then mihawks who you need to clear a rproblem. together with 4 other p2p units we're not really talking about a power creep problem"
OnePieceTC,3cwbsp,With_Hands_And_Paper,1 point,Sun Jul 12 16:57:26 2015 UTC,"Because if you ever tried to use one of said characters you'd knlw yourself it's not that easy to pull off their amazingness.  G3 screws you over completely by missing once, WB is a high-risk high-reward captain, Rayleigh and log luffy are similar to G3, SW Ace has very specific niche requirements etc... Their awesomeness is balanced by the risks you take by using them so it's nice, they're not straight out better than any 2,5x captain"

OnePieceTC,3cwbsp,Jalidric,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:45:18 2015 UTC,"Whitebeard requires a lot of planning for bosses because most of the time if your calculations aren't 100% correct you will die. A reason people don't complain is because OPTC doesn't really have any competitive aspects at all as well as that many of the best units in the game can be farmed for or obtained through raid boss (Monster Chopper, Mihawk, Garp, Arlong, Coby etc.)  Also you can clear all content so far without having any of the 6* units (Whitebeard, Rayleigh etc.)"

Almost all my units are around lv50 so I already made the decission to spend some gems. I guess I'll do 30sta first, if Druval drops I'll stop here. Otherwise I may do 40sta if I think I can do it with a couple gems."

OnePieceTC,3csh6y,xAndrenx,1 point,Fri Jul 10 14:53:27 2015 UTC,Are we supposed to try to stall past the defense buff on the 5th stage? Used BB active and it didn't do that much to duval. (Running 30 stam btw).  And it seems the general consensus is to GP the 4th stage?
OnePieceTC,3csh6y,WanderingWasabi,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:31:37 2015 UTC,I think so. The guideblog recommended it too.
OnePieceTC,3csh6y,xAndrenx,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:39:57 2015 UTC,"I ended up doing the 30 stam with a Blackbeard + high lvl SW Luffy friend team after failing 4 times with either double Blackbeard or double G3. Got tired of wasting stamina to no avail so i ended up using two gems on the last stage. Could have done it with just one gem but i didn't notice SW Luffy's special was up upon first revival. At least Duval dropped. He seems to be a decent sub if you lower his special CD but unfortunately i will not be consistently farming him any time soon. For now he doesn't even make it into my shooter or dex team, i have a high lvl Apoo and a low special CD Perona for dex/shooter spots, so i guess he'll just sit in my box for a while."

You can say I'm an idiot, I play too much, etc. That's fine. That's a subjective opinion. I'd please like you to refrain from assuming what kind of person I am entirely, what kind of choices I make outside this game simply based on screenshots I have uploaded.

As cool as it looks to have all these characters maxed, and I'm pretty sure I've said that before on this subreddit, spending this much money on a mobile game is worse than gambling because you don't ""win"" anything.

If he's able to spend his money on the game, he has most likely no financial problems so I'm happy about him being able to spend his money as he pleases (Maybe he has, but I don't hope so) It's possible that he's addicted to the game. If that's the case, then you're absolutely right, it's a bad thing - but I think we can't do anything about an addiction, and it's not our job to decide if he's addicted or not, neither are we entitled to judge anyone for enjoying his life. You're right if you say such a system shouldn't be encouraged, but this is the outcome of capitalism. If there's profit to make, companies will probably do so, without caring about the problems of people. And in the end there are people are living off the money spent on this game."

OnePieceTC,3csmld,DBRakka,-3,Fri Jul 10 19:38:22 2015 UTC,"Yep... basically because I don't care about cars (don't have one, don't need one and probably won't buy one until I'm 50 or older)"
OnePieceTC,3csmld,MILKB0T,-4,Fri Jul 10 19:40:49 2015 UTC,"don't need one and probably won't buy one until I'm 50 or older   Oh child, you'll grow up in a few years and realize how ridiculous that statement is."
OnePieceTC,3csmld,MILKB0T,4,Fri Jul 10 19:55:04 2015 UTC,"Well... in a few years I'm going to turn 50, so I'll let you know if that's ridiculous (I'm glad I live in a country where I don't need a car to go around)"
OnePieceTC,3csmld,day2k,-8,Fri Jul 10 20:04:15 2015 UTC,Tibet?
OnePieceTC,3csmld,DBRakka,8,Fri Jul 10 20:07:03 2015 UTC,"I know you're trying to be funny, but unfortunately, Tibet is not any more a country, as it was invaded in the 49 by China (yet another reason to not like the Chinese government). I live somewhere in Europe, in a place where things are still civilised."
OnePieceTC,3csmld,workisnotfun,1 point,Fri Jul 10 20:33:18 2015 UTC,"Why the hell would anyone NEED a car. I live in the city and its faster to take public transport, walk or bike than it is to take a car.  Not everyone lives in the middle of no where and can't even get to their neighbours place without a car. I think you are the one who needs to grow up and realise not everyone needs and priorities are the same as yours and it doesn't matter what people spend their money on."
OnePieceTC,3csmld,Doppelgengar13,5,Sat Jul 11 08:02:40 2015 UTC,"That is an incredibly bad comparison. People often restore cars and get many times their investment back. Even if you aren't looking to sell it, a restored car is still an asset. You can use a car as collateral on a loan. You can use a car as a point on a resume. You can use a car to do other things.  Spending money like this on a mobile game that will one day be discontinued by bamco is not a hobby. It's an addiction. This guy has fallen head over heels for the skinner box and frankly it's pretty sad."
OnePieceTC,3csmld,_Madara_,2,Fri Jul 10 19:51:05 2015 UTC,"Because at this point, it's an addiction problem, like alcoholism. Spending a few bucks once in a while is fine. Spending literally thousands of dollars on a, again, FREE TO PLAY MOBILE GAME, is insane. Not to mention that it's pointless on the long term, because by eliminating the challange in the game with money, the game loses any fun value. Events? Raid bosses? If you have all characters on MAX, they are not even a challange. Why even bother playing then? It's just spending a few thousand bucks for a ""you win"" button."
OnePieceTC,3csmld,TheRealBlydd,8,Fri Jul 10 19:49:26 2015 UTC,Ugh. I don't want to respond to all of this but I woke up to this shitshow. I made all my points above so I'll just stick with this.  I can affoooooooooord itttttt.  Without ruining my life. I can afford it from what I earn. Without changing my lifestyle and without drastically altering my life.  My. life. is. good.  Please stop trying to tell me that my life is somehow ruined by how I play this game.
OnePieceTC,3csmld,raistlyn,-3,Sat Jul 11 00:59:41 2015 UTC,"No-one is trying to tell you your life is ruined, you seem to be projecting that yourself. Blowing a few thousand on a game is not going to ruin anyone's life, but it's pretty pathetic to do that and then go and post about it as if it's an achievement."
OnePieceTC,3csmld,raistlyn,6,Sat Jul 11 04:21:45 2015 UTC,"""It's an addiction problem.""  ""It's insane""  ""I honestly feel sad for this guy, and if you feel happy for him, you are a horrible person.""  Save your petty couch psychotherapy and your high horses. Literally a huge part of this subreddit is people sharing various points of the game that they are at. I never claimed this was an achievement or that this makes me better. I didn't even tag this as the achievement. One of the mods did. As I explained in another response, I posted because ""I did something in this game and I wanted to share."" That makes up about 70% of the posts in this subreddit. You keep trying to frame it as if I did to claim that I was better than the rest of the people- or that I was somehow saying that this should be the norm.  To me, it seems like you are doing the projecting. Stop putting words in my mouth. Maybe if this post came off as condescending or ""bragging"" when it contained nothing of the sort, consider that it's perhaps because you are the one that feels insecure?"
OnePieceTC,3csmld,MonkeyDLubeMe,-3,Sat Jul 11 06:00:19 2015 UTC,"okay so which of those statements are about your life being ruined by this game?  And what on earth would I have to feel insecure about about your posts? I just see you as stupid and wasting your money on a skinner box, so I thought I should chime in and maybe knock some sense into you."
OnePieceTC,3csmld,etnanisor,6,Sat Jul 11 09:14:30 2015 UTC,"Wow. I think that was the most bareface display of arrogance I've seen all day. There is nothing objectively wrong with a person doing what they want with what they have. Especially when- as I keep reiterating- it doesn't affect the rest of my life. And since even you recognize this and realize that you can't justify the criticism, you resort to petty personal attacks- like calling it pathetic. But no, you just want to help. Because you obviously know better. You may call that knocking some sense. The rest of the world calls that arrogance.  And clearly, reading is not your strong suit- I've never classified this as achievement. Never said it was something that made me better than others. If you see a post where literally the sole context is ""Hey guys, this is what I did in this game"" and your gut response is ""that's pathetic"" and ""why is he bragging."" I hate to break it to you, but that's your victim complex, not any doing of mine. I can't help you with that. Don't ask me why you'd be insecure. That's for your therapist, not me.  Again. Bottom line. I can spend my money how I want. Especially when it doesn't influence the rest of my life. If you have to resort to petty personal attacks because you cannot accept this, I suggest you look in the mirror and start looking for the pathetic there, not me."
OnePieceTC,3csmld,Yakuzaaaa,3,Sat Jul 11 11:48:40 2015 UTC,"Mind you that even with max skill and max lvl, the game is still pretty hard (fortnights always have been relatively doable by everyone), mostly because the available units dont have power creep but raid bosses do. I rather like that about this game. Bandai shows a lot of restraint not making early gatcha units obselete.  Even if he spends $200+/mo, it still doesn't compare to what people do in other games cough CoC cough game of war cough. I refuse to spend a single dollar there  I think it's comparable to say, buying a season pass to your favorite sports team, or playing a few rounds of weekend golf. I dont have too much time to farm, so I rather wait for skill-up events and box expansion."
OnePieceTC,3csmld,DblBeast,2,Fri Jul 10 22:07:28 2015 UTC,"Mind you that even with max skill and max lvl, the game is still pretty hard   Oh come on. If you'd have half your box maxed out, while owning every single rare gatcha character, you wouldn't even break a sweat even on raidbosses."
